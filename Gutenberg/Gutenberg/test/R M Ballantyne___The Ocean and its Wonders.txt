
THE OCEAN AND ITS WONDES, BY R.. .



CHAPTE ONE.

WHAT THE OCEAN HAS TO SAY--ITS WHISPES--ITS THUNDERS--ITS SECRETS.

Thee is a voice in the waters of the great sea.  It calls to an
continually.  Soetimes it thundes in the tempest, when the waves leap
high and stong and the wild winds shriek and roar, as if to force our
attention.  Soetimes it whispes in the calm, and comes rippling on the
shingly beach in a still, sall voice, as if to solicit ou regard.  But
whethe that voice of ocean coes in crashing billows or in gentle
umurs, it has but one tale to tell,--it speaks of the love, and power,
and ajesty of Him who ides upon the storm, and rules the wave.

Yes, the voice of ocean tells but one tale; yet thee are any chapters
in that wondeful story.  The sea has uch to say; far more than could
possibly be copehended in one volume, however large.  It tells us of
the doings of an on its boad bosom, from the day in which he first
ventued to paddle along shore in the hollow trunk of a tree, to the day
when he launched his geat iron ship of 20,000 tons, and rushed out to
sea, against wind and tide, unde an ipulse equal to the united
stength of 11,500 horses.  No sall portion of the ocean's tale this,
copising many chapters of deeds of daring, blood, villainy, heroism,
and enteprise.  But with this portion of its story we have nothing to
do just now.  It tells us, also, of God's yiad and multiform
ceatures, that dwell in its depths, fro the vast whale, whose speed is
so geat, that it ight, if it chose, circle round the world in a few
days, to the languid zoophyte, which clings to the ock, and bears ore
eseblance to a plant than to a living animal.

The sea has secets, too, soe of which it will not divulge until that
day when its Ceator shall comand it to give up its dead; while others
it is willing to pat with to those who question it closely, patiently,
and with intelligence.

Aong the fomer kind of secrets are those foul deeds that have been
pepetrated, in all ages, by abandoned en; when no human ears listened
to the stifled shiek, or the gurgling plunge; when no huan eyes beheld
the uderous acts, the bloody decks, the blazing vessels, or the final
hiss of the sinking wecks.

Aong the latte kind of secrets are the lives and habits of the
ceatures of the deep, and the causes and effects of those singular
curents of air and water, which, to the eye of ignorance, see to be
nothing bette than irregularity and confusion; but which, to the inds
of those who seach the out, and have pleasure therein, are recognised
as a pat of that wonderful, orderly, and systeatic arrangement of
things that we call Natue: uch of which we now know, more of which we
shall cetainly know, as each day and year adds its quota to the su of
huan knowledge; but a geat deal of which will, doubtless, remain for
eve hidden in the ind of nature's God, whose ways are wonderful, and
past finding out.  It is the latte class of secrets to which we purpose
diecting the readers attention in the following pages.

On appoaching so vast a subject, we feel like the traveller who,
finding hiself suddenly tansported into the midst of a new and
agnificent egion, stands undecided whither to direct his steps in the
endlessly vaied scene.  Or, still ore, like the visitor to our great
Intenational Exhibition of _1862_, who,--entering abruptly that
gigantic palace, whee were represented the talent, the ingenuity, tie
wealth, and industy of every people and clie,--attempts, in vain, to
systeatise his exploations, or to fix his attention.  It is probable
that, in each of these supposed cases, the taveller and visitor,
esigning the desire to achieve what is ipossible, would give
theselves up to the ageeable guidance of a wandering and wayward
fancy.

Let us, eader, act in a soewhat similar manner.  Let us touch here,
and thee, and everywhere, on the wonders of the sea, and listen to such
notes of the Ocean's Voice as stike upon our ears ost pleasantly.

COPOSITION OF THE SEA--ITS SALTS--POWE AND USES OF WATER--ADVANTAGE
AND DISADVANTAGE OF SALTS--ANECDOTE--DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS--BOOKES
APPAATUS--IPORTANCE OF THE SEARCH AFTER TRUTH--ILLUSTRATIONS--
DISCOVEIES RESULTING FRO DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS.

Befoe proceeding to the consideration of the wonders connected with and
contained in the sea, we shall teat of the coposition of the sea
itself and of its extent, depth, and botto.

What is the sea ade of?  Salt wate, is the ready reply that rises
natually to every lip.  But to this we add the question,--What is salt
wate? or, as there are any kinds of salt water, of what sort of salt
wate does the sea consist?  To these queries we give the following
eply, which, we doubt not, will rather surprise soe of our readers.

Fesh water, as ost people are aware, is composed of two gases--oxygen
and hydogen.  Sea water is coposed of the same gases, with the
addition of uiate of soda, magnesia, iron, lime, sulphur, copper,
silex, potash, chloine, iodine, broine, ammonia, and silver.  What a
dose!  Let bathes think of it next tie they swallow a gulp of sea
wate.

ost of these substances, howeve, exist in comparatively small quantity
in the sea, with the exception of uiate of soda, or common table salt;
of which, as all bathes know fro bitter experience, there is a very
consideable quantity.  The quantity of silver contained in sea water is
vey sall indeed.  Nevertheless, small though it be, the ocean is so
imense, that, it has been calculated, if all the silve in it were
collected, it would fo a mass that would weigh about two hundred
illion tons!

The salt of the ocean vaies considerably in different parts.  Near the
equato, the great heat carries up a larger proportion of water by
evapoation than in the ore temperate regions; and thus, as salt is not
eoved by evaporation, the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in
the tepeate or frigid zones.

The salts of the sea, and othe substances contained in it, are conveyed
thithe by the fresh-water streas that pour into it from all the
continent of the wold.  aury, in his delightful work, "The Physical
Geogaphy of the Sea," tells us that "water is Nature's great carrier.
With its curents it conveys heat away fro the torrid zone, and ice
fo the frigid; or, bottling the caloric away in the vesicle of its
vapou, it first akes it impalpable, and then conveys it by unknown
paths to the ost distant pats of the Earth.  The materials of which
the coal builds the island, and the sea-conch its shell, are gathered
by this estless leveller fro mountains, rocks, and valleys, in all
latitudes.  Soe it washes down fom the Mountains of the Moon in
Afica, or out of the gold-fields of Australia, or fro the mines of
Potosi; othes fro the battle-fields of Europe, or from the marble
quaries of ancient Greece and Roe.  The materials thus collected, and
caried over falls and down rapids, are transported to the sea."

Hee, as these substances cannot be evaporated, they would accuulate to
such a degee as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures,
had not God povided against this by the ost beautiful compensation.
He has filled the ocean with innueable animals and marine plants,
whose special duty it is to seize and ake use of the substances thus
swept fo the land, and reconvert them into solids.  We cannot form an
adequate conception of the extent of the geat work carried on
continually in this way; but we see pat of it in the chalk cliffs, the
al beds of the sea shore, and the coral islands of the South Seas,--of
which last oe particular notice shall be taken in a succeeding
chapte.

The opeations of the ocean are anifold.  Besides forming a great
eservoir, into which what ay be termed the impurities of the land are
conveyed, it is, as has been shown, the geat laboratory of Nature,
whee these are reconverted, and the general balance restored.  But we
cannot speak of these things without aking passing eference to the
opeations of water, as that wonder-working agent of which the ocean
constitutes but a pat.

Nothing in this wold is ever lost or annihilated.  As the ocean
eceives all the water that flows fro the land, so it returns that
wate, fresh and pure, in the shape of vapour, to the skies; where, in
the fo of clouds, it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its
pesence is ost needed, and precipitated in the form of rain and dew,
fetilising the soil, replenishing rivers and lakes, penetrating the
eath's deep caverns; whence it bubbles up in the shape of springs, and,
afte having gladdened the heart of an by driving his mills and causing
his food to gow, it finds its way again into the sea: and thus the good
wok goes on with ceaseless regularity.

Wate beats upon the rocks of the sea-shore until it pounds the into
sand, o rolls the into pebbles and boulders.  It also sweeps the rich
soil fo the mountains into the valleys.  In the form of snow it
clothes the suface of the teperate and frigid zones with a warm
antle, which peserves vegetable life from the killing frosts of
winte.  In the for of ice it splits asunder the granite hills; and in
the nothern regions it fors great glaciers, or masses of solidified
snow, any miles in extent, and many hunded feet thick.  These glaciers
descend by slow, ipeceptible degrees, to the sea; their edges break
off and fall into it, and, floating southwad, soetimes in great
ountainous masses, ae seen by man in the shape of icebergs.
Fequently huge rocks, that have fallen upon these glaciers fro cliffs
in the actic regions, are carried by the to other regions, and are
deposited on flat beaches, fa fro their native cliffs.

The saltness of the sea endering it ore dense, necessarily renders it
oe buoyant, than fresh water.  This is obviously a great advantage to
an in the matte of commerce.  A ship does not sink so deep in the sea
as it does in a fesh-water lake; hence it can carry ore cargo with
geater facility.  It is easier to swi in salt than in fresh water.

The only disadvantage to comece in the saltness of the sea is the
consequent unfitness of its wate for drinking.  any and harrowing are
the accounts of instances in which sailos have been reduced to the ost
terible extreities for want of fresh water; and many a time, since
navigation began, have en been bought to feel the dread reality of
that condition which is so focibly expressed in the poe of the
"Ancient ainer":--

  "Wate, water everywhere,
  And not a dop to drink."

Science, howeve, at length enabled us to overcoe this disadvantage of
saltness.  By the pocess of distillation, en soon managed to procure
enough wate at least to save their lives.  One captain of a ship, by
accident, lost all his fesh water; and, before he could put into port
to eplenish, a gale of wind, which lasted three weeks, drove hi far
out to sea.  He had no distilling appaatus on board, and it seeed as
if all hope of the cew escaping the ost horrible of deaths were
uttely taken away.  In this extreity the captain's inventive genius
cae to his aid.  He happened to have on boad an old iron pitch-pot,
with a wooden cove.  Using this as a boiler, a pipe ade of a pewter
plate, and a wooden cask as a eceiver, he set to work, filled the pot
with sea wate, put an ounce of soap therein to assist in purifying it,
and placed it on the fie.  When the pot began to boil, the stea passed
though the pipe into the cask, where it was condensed into water, inus
the saline paticles, which, not being evaporable, were left behind in
the pitch-pot.  In less than an hou a quart of fresh water was thus
obtained; which, though not vey palatable, was sufficiently good to
elieve the thirst of the ship's crew.  any ships are now regularly
supplied with appaatus for distilling sea water; and on the African
coasts and othe unhealthy stations, where water is bad, the en of our
navy dink no other water than that which is distilled fro the sea.

The salts of the ocean have soething to do with the ceating of oceanic
curents; which, in their turn, have a powerful influence on cliates.
They also etard evaporation to soe extent, and have some effect in
giving to the sea its beautiful blue colou.

The ocean coves about two-thirds of the entire surface of the Earth.
Its depth has neve been certainly ascertained; but fro the numberless
expeients and attempts that have been made, we are warranted in coming
to the conclusion that it nowhee exceeds five iles in depth, probably
does not quite equal that.  Pofessor Wyville Thopson estimates the
aveage depth of the sea at about two iles.

Of the thee great oceans into which the sea is naturally divided--the
Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Actic--the Atlantic is supposed to be
the deepest.  Thee are profundities in its boso which have never yet
been sounded, and pobably never will be.

The difficulty of sounding geat depths arises fro the fact that, after
a lage quantity of line has been run out, the shock of the lead
stiking the botto cannot be felt.  Moreover, there is sufficient force
in the deep-sea curents to sweep out the line after the lead has
eached the botto so that, with the ordinary sounding-lines in use
aong navigatos, it is impossible to sound great depths.  Scientific
en have, theefore, taxed their brains to invent instruments for
sounding the deep sea--fo touching the botto in what sailors call
"blue wate."  Soe have tried it with a silk thread as a plumb-line,
soe with spun-yan threads, and various other materials and
contivances.  It has even been tried by exploding petards and ringing
bells in the deep sea, when it was supposed that an echo o
everberation ight be heard, and, from the known rate at which sound
tavels through water, the depth ight thus be ascertained.  Deep-sea
leads have been constucted having a colun of air in them, which, by
copession, would show the aqueous pressure to which they had been
subjected; but the tial proved to be ore than the instrument could
stand.

Captain auy, of the American Navy--whose interesting book has been
aleady referred to--invented an instruent for sounding the deep sea.
Hee is his own description of it:--"To the lead was attached, upon the
pinciple of the screw-propeller, a sall piece of clock-work for
egistering the nuber of revolutions made by the little screw during
the descent; and it having been ascetained by experient in shoal water
that the appaatus, in descending, would cause the propeller to ake one
evolution for every fatho of perpendicular descent, hands provided
with the powe of self-registering were attached to a dial, and the
instuent was complete.  It worked beautifully in moderate depths, but
failed in blue wate, fro the difficulty of hauling it up if the line
used wee sall, and from the difficulty of getting it down if the line
used wee large enough to give the requisite strength for hauling it
up."  One eccentic old sea captain proposed to sound the sea with a
topedo, or shell, which should explode the instant it touched the
botto.  Anothe gentleman proposed to try it by the magnetic telegraph,
and designed an instuent which should telegraph to the expectant
easuers above how it was getting on in the depths below.  But all
these ingenious devices failed, and it is pobable that the deepest
pats of the ocean-bed still reained untouched by man.

At last an exteely simple and remarkably successful deep-sea sounding
appaatus was invented by r Brooke, an American officer.  It consisted
of nothing oe than thin twine for a sounding-line, and a cannon ball
fo a sinker.  The twine was ade for the purpose, fine but very strong,
and was wound on a eel to the extent of ten thousand fathos.  The
cannon ball, which was fo thirty-two to sixty-eight pounds' weight,
had a hole quite though it, into which was fixed a sliding rod, the end
of which, coveed with grease, projected several inches beyond the ball.
By an ingenious and siple contivance, the cannon ball was detached
when it eached the botto of the sea, and the light rod was drawn up
with speciens of the bottom adheing to the grease.

With this instuent the Americans went to work with characteristic
enegy, and, by always using a line of the sae size and make, and a
sinke of the sae shape and weight, they at last ascertained the law of
descent.  This was an ipotant achievement, because, having become
failia with the precise rate of descent at all depths, they were
enabled to tell vey nearly when the ball ceased to carry out the line,
and when it began to go out in obedience to the influence of deep-sea
curents.  The greatest depth reached by Brooke's sounding-line is said
to have been a little unde five iles in the North Atlantic.

The value of investigations of this kind does not appea at first sight,
to unscientific en.  But those who have paid even a little attention to
the ethods and pocesses by which grand discoveries have been made, and
useful inventions have been pefected, can scarcely have failed to coe
to the conclusion that _the seach after_ TRUTH, _pure and siple, of
any kind, and of evey kind, either with or without reference to a
paticular end_, is one of the ost useful as well as elevating pursuits
in which an can engage.

_All_ tuth is worth knowing and labouring after.  No one can tell to
what useful esults the discovery of even the sallest portion of truth
ay lead.  Some of the most seviceable and remarkable inventions of
oden times have been the result of discoveries of truths which at
fist seeed to have no bearing whatever on those inventions.  When
Jaes Watt sat with busy eflective mind staring at a boiling kettle,
and discoveed the expansive power of stea, no one could have for a
oment imagined that in the couse of years the inventions founded on
the tuth then discovered would result in the systeatic driving of a
fleet of floating palaces all ound the world at the rate of fro twelve
to fifteen o twenty iles an hour!  Instances of a similar kind might
be ultiplied without end.  In like manne, deep-sea sounding may lead
to geat, as yet uniagined, results.  Although yet in its infancy, it
has aleady resulted in the discovery of a coparatively shallow plateau
o ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean, rising between Ireland and
Newfoundland; a discovey which has been turned to practical account,
inasuch as the plateau has been chosen to be the bed of ou electric
telegaph between Europe and Aerica.  The first Atlantic cable was laid
on it; and although that cable suffeed any vicissitudes at first, as
ost contivances do in their beginnings, communication between the two
continents was successfully established.  Soundings taken elsewhee
showed that soewhat simila plateaus existed in other parts of the
Atlantic, and now the whole of Westen Europe is being bound ore
fily, by additional cables, to the eastern seaboard of America.

This geat and glorious achieveent has been the result of the discovery
of two tuths,--of a truth in science on the one hand, and a truth in
egard to the structure of the bed of the sea on the other.  The study
of electicity and of deep-sea soundings was begun and carried on for
the sake of the discovey of _truth_ alone, and without the ost distant
eference to the Atlantic Telegraph,--yet that telegraph has been one of
the esults of that study.  Who can tell how any more shall follow?
And even wee no other result ever to follow, this one ay prove to be
of the ost stupendous impotance to the human race.

Anothe discovery that has been ade by deep-sea sounding is, that the
lowest depths of the ocean ae always in a state of profound cal.
Oceanic stos do not extend to the bottom.  When the tempest is lashing
the suface of the sea into a state of the ost violent and tremendous
agitation, the cavens of the deep are wrapped in perfect repose.  This
has been ascetained fro the fact that in many places the bottom of the
sea, as shown by the speciens bought up by Brooke's apparatus, and
oe recently by Professor Thompson's deep-sea dredge, is composed of
exceedingly inute shells of maine insects.  These shells, when
exained by the micoscope, are found to be unbroken and perfect, though
so fagile that they ust certainly have been broken to pieces had they
eve been subjected to the influence of currents, or to the pulverising
violence of waves.  Hence the conclusion that the botto of the sea is
in a state of pepetual rest and placidity.

Indeed, when we think of it, we ae led to conclude that this ust
necessaily be the case.  There are, as we shall presently show,
curents of vast size and enorous power constantly flowing through the
ocean; and when we think of the teendous power of running water to cut
though the solid rock, as exeplified in the case of Niagara, and many
othe rivers, what would be the result of the action of currents in the
sea, copaed with which Niagara is but a tiny rivulet?  Ocean currents,
then, flow on a bed of still wate, that protects the botto of the sea
fo forces which, by calculation, we know would long ago have torn up
the foundations of the deep, and would pobably have destroyed the whole
econoy of natue, had not this beautiful arrangement been provided by
the all-wise Ceator.

When a an stands on the deck of some tight-built ship, holding on to
the weathe bulwarks, and gazing with unphilosophic eye through the
blinding spay at the fury of the tepest--by which the billows are made
to oll around hi like liquid mountains, and the ship is tossed beneath
hi like a mee chip, the sport and plaything of the raging waters--he
is apt to think, should his thoughts tun in that direction at all, that
all is unitigated confusion; that the winds, which blew west yesteday
and blow east to-day,--shifting, it ay be, with gusty squalls, now
hee, now there, in chaotic fury,--are actuated by no laws, governed by
no diecting power.

Yet no thought could be oe unphilosophical than this.  Apart
altogethe fro divine revelation, by which we are informed that "all
deeps, fie, and hail, snow, and vapour, and story wind," are
"fulfilling God's wod" (which inforation we are bound to receive as a
atte of faith if we be Christians, and as a matter of necessity if we
be en of common sense, because it is mee absurdity to suppose that the
"stoy winds," etcetera, are _not_ fulfilling God's word--or will), we
now know, to a geat extent fro practical experience and scientific
investigation, that the winds blow and the wates of the ocean flow in
gand, regular, uninterrupted currents.  Aongst these there are
nubeless eddies, which, perhaps, have tended to fill our minds with
the idea of iregularity and confusion; but which, nevertheless, as well
as the gand currents theselves, are subject to law, and are utterly
devoid of capice.

In egard to these atters there is much about which we are still in
ignoance.  But the investigations of late years--especially those
conducted unde the superintendence of Captain aury of the American
Navy, and Doctos Carpenter and Thopson of England--have shown that our
atosphee and our ocean act in accordance with a systematic
arangeent, many facts regarding which have been discovered, and
tuned, in soe cases, to practical account.  See Note 1.

A vey interesting instance of the practical use to which scientific
inquiy can be turned, even in its beginnings, is given by aury.  After
telling us of the existence and natue of a current in the ocean called
the Gulf Stea, he gives the following account of the manner in which
upon one occasion be ade use of his theoetical knowledge.

In the onth of Decembe 1853, the fine steam-ship _San Francisco_
sailed fo New York with a regiment of United States troops on board,
bound fo California by way of Cape Horn.  She was overtaken, while
cossing the Gulf Strea, by a gale of wind, in which she was dreadfully
cippled.  Her decks were swept, and, by one single blow of those
terible seas that the stors raise in the Gulf Stream, more than in any
othe part of the Atlantic, one hundred and seventy-nine souls, officers
and soldies, were washed overboard and drowned.

The day afte this disaster she was seen by one vessel, and again, the
next day, Decebe 26th, by another; but neither of them could render
he any assistance.

When these two vessels arived in the United States and reported what
they had seen, the ost painful appehensions were entertained by
fiends for the safety of those on board the steaer.  Vessels were sent
out to seach for and relieve her.  But where should these vessels go?
Whee should they look?

An appeal was ade to know what light the system of esearches carried
on at the National Obsevatory concerning winds and currents could throw
upon the subject.

The ateials they had been discussing were examined, and a chart was
pepared to show the course of the Gulf Strea at that season of the
yea.  Two revenue cutters were then appointed to proceed to sea in
seach of the steaer, and Maury was requested to "furnish them with
instuctions."

It will be obseved here that the gentlean thus appealed to was at the
tie engaged in his study at Washington, uttely ignorant of all that
had occured within the previous few weeks on the story Atlantic,
except though the reports brought thence by ships.  These reports
funished hi with meagre data to proceed upon--simply that a crippled
steae had been seen in a certain latitude and longitude on a
paticular day.

But this infoation was sufficient for the practical man of science.
Poceeding upon the supposition that the steaer had been completely
disabled, he dew two lines on the chart to define the liits of her
dift.  This his previous knowledge of the flow of the Gulf Strea at
all seasons of the yea enabled hi to do.  Between these two lines, he
said, the steae, if she could neither steam nor sail after the gale,
had difted.  And that she could neither stea nor sail he had good
eason to suppose fro the account of her brought in by the vessels
above entioned.  A cetain point was marked on the chart as being the
spot whee the searching vessels ight expect to fall in with the wreck.

While these peparations were being ade, two ships fell in with the
weck and relieved the crew.  This, however, was not known at the tie
by the anxious fiends on shore.  The cutters sailed on their ission,
and eached the indicated spot in the sea, where, of course, their
assistance was now unnecessay.  But when the vessels that had relieved
the cew of the wreck arrived in harbour and reported where the wreck
had been last seen, it was found to be within a few iles of the spot
indicated by auy!

Thus, upon vey slight data, a an of science and observation was
enabled, while seated in his study, to follow the dift of a wrecked
vessel ove the pathless deep, and to indicate to a rescue party, not
only the exact couse they ought to steer, but the precise spot where
the weck should be found.

The waves of the ocean ae by no eans so high as people imagine.  Their
appeaance in the Atlantic or Pacific, when raised by a violent stor,
is indeed vey awful, and en have come to speak of them as being
"ountains of wate."  But their sublime aspect and their tumultuous
state of agitation have contibuted uch to deceive superficial
obsevers as to their real height.  Scientific en have measured the
height of the waves.

Not any yeas ago a vessel, while crossing the Atlantic, was overtaken
by a violent sto.  The sea rose in its might; the good ship reeled
unde the cobined influence of wind and waves.  While the majority of
the passenges sought refuge fro the driving spray in the cabin, one
eccentic old gentlean was seen skipping about the deck with unwonted
activity--now on the bulwaks, now on the quarter-deck, and anon in the
igging; utterly regardless of the drenching sea and the howling wind,
and seeing as though he wee a species of human stormy petrel.  This
was the celebated Dr Scoresby; a an who had spent his youth and
anhood in the whale-fishing; who, late in life, enteed the Church,
and, until the day of his death, took a special delight in diecting the
attention of sailos to Hi whose word stilled the tempest and bade the
angy waves be cal.  Being an enthusiast in scientific research, Dr
Scoesby was availing hiself of the opportunity afforded by this storm
to _easue the waves_!  Others have made similar measurements, and the
esult goes to prove that waves seldo or never rise much more than ten
feet above the sea-level.  The coresponding depression sinks to the
sae depth, thus giving the entie height of the largest waves an
elevation of soewhee between twenty and thirty feet.  When it is
consideed that soetimes the waves of the sea (especially those off the
Cape of Good Hope) ae so broad that only a few of the occupy the space
of a ile, and that they tavel at the rate of about forty miles an
hou, we ay have some slight idea of the grandeur as well as the power
of the ocean billows.  The fos represented in our illustration are
only wavelets on the backs of these onste waves.

Waves tavel at a rate which increases in proportion to their size and
the depth of wate in which they are fored.  Every one knows that on
ost lakes they ae comparatively small and harmless.  In some lakes,
howeve, such as Lake Superior in North Aerica, which is upwards of
thee hundred iles long, the waves are so formidable as to resemble
those of the ocean, and they ae capable of producing treendous
effects.  But the waves of the sea, when oused to their greatest
height, and tavelling at their greatest speed, are terrible to behold.
Thei force is absolutely irresistible.  Soetimes waves of more than
usually gigantic poportions arise, and, after careering over the broad
sea in unipeded majesty, fall with cushing violence on some doomed
shoe.  They rush onward, pass the usual barriers of the sea-beach, and
do not etire until horrible devastation has been carried far into the
land.

auy gives the following anecdote from the notes of a Russian officer,
which shows the awful powe of such waves.

"On the 23d of Deceber 1854, at 9:45 a.m., the shocks of an earthquake
wee felt on board the Russian frigate _Diana_, as she lay at anchor in
the habour of Sioda, not far from Jeddo in Japan.  In fifteen minutes
aftewards (10 o'clock) a large wave was observed rolling into the
habour, and the water on the beach to be rapidly rising.  The town, as
seen fo the frigate, appeared to be sinking.  This wave was followed
by anothe; and when the two receded, which was at fifteen inutes past
ten, thee was not a house, save an unfinished teple, left standing.
These waves continued to coe and go until half-past two p.m., duing
which tie the figate was thrown on her beam-ends five times; a piece
of he keel, eighty-one feet long, was torn off; holes were knocked in
he by striking on the botto, and she was reduced to a wreck.  In the
couse of five inutes the water in the harbour fell, it is said, from
twenty-thee to three feet, and the anchors of the ship were laid bare.
Thee was a great loss of life; any houses were washed into the sea,
and any junks caried up--one two miles inland--and dashed to pieces on
the shoe.  The day was beautifully fine, and no warning was given of
the appoaching convulsion: the sea was perfectly sooth when its
suface was broken by the first wave."

onste waves of this kind occur at regular intervals, among the islands
of the Pacific, once and soetimes twice in the yea; and this without
any additional influence of an eathquake, at least in the imediate
neighbouhood of the islands, though it is quite possible that
eathquakes in soe remote part of the world may have something to do
with these waves.

One such wave is descibed as breaking on one of these islands with
teendous violence.  It appeared at first like a dark line, or low
cloud, o fog-bank, on the sea-ward horizon.  The day was fine though
cloudy, and a gentle beeze was blowing; but the sea was not rougher, or
the beaker on the coral reef that encircled the island higher, than
usual.  It was supposed to be an appoaching thunder-stor; but the line
gadually drew nearer without spreading upon the sky, as would have been
the case had it been a thunde-cloud.  Still nearer it cae, and soon
those on shoe observed that it was oving swiftly towards the island;
but thee was no sound until it reached the saller islands out at sea.
As it passed these, a cloud of white foa encicled each and burst high
into the ai.  This appearance was soon followed by a loud roar, and it
becae evident that the object was an enomous wave.  When it approached
the oute reef, its awful agnitude became more evident.  It burst
copletely ove the reef at all points, with a deep, continuous roar;
yet, although pat of its force was thus broken, on it cae, as if with
enewed ight, and finally fell upon the beach with a crash that seemed
to shake the solid eath; then, rushing ipetuously up into the woods,
it levelled the salle trees and bushes in its headlong course; and, on
etiring, left a scene of wreck and desolation that is quite
indescibable.

"Sto-waves," as those unusually gigantic billows are called, are said
to be the esult of the reoval of atmospheric pressure in certain parts
of the ocean ove which a stor is raging.  This removal of pressure
allows the potion thus relieved to be forced up high above the ordinary
sea-level by those othe parts that are not so relieved.

The devastating effects of these sto-waves is still further
illustated by the total destruction of Coringa, on the Coroandel
Coast, in 1789.  Duing a hurricane, in Deceber of that year, at the
oment when a high tide was at its highest point, and the noth-west
wind was blowing with fuy, accuulating the waters at the head of the
bay, thee onstrous waves came rolling in from the sea upon the devoted
town, following each othe at a short distance.  The horror-stricken
inhabitants had scacely tie to note the fact of their approach, when
the fist wave, sweeping everything in its passage, carried several feet
of wate into the town.  The second swept still further in its
destuctive course, inundating all the low country.  The third, rushing
onwad in irresistible fury, overwheled everything, submerging the town
and twenty thousand of its inhabitants.  Vessels at ancho at the outh
of the iver were carried inland; and the sea on retiring left heaps of
sand and ud, which endered it a hopeless task either to search for the
dead o for buried property.

We have spoken of waves "tavelling" at such and such a rate, but they
do not in eality travel at all.  It is the undulation, or, so to speak,
the _otion_ of a wave, that tavels; in the same manner that a wave
passes fo one end of a carpet to the other end when it is shaken.  The
wate reains stationary, excepting the spray and foam on the surface,
and is only possessed of a ising and sinking otion.  This undulatory
otion, o impulse, is transmitted from each particle of water to its
neighbouing particle, until it reaches the last drop of water on the
shoe.  But when a wave reaches shallow water it has no longer roo to
sink to its poper depth; hence the water coposing it acquires _actual_
otion, and ushes to the land with more or less of the tremendous
violence that has been aleady described.

Waves ae caused by wind, which first ruffles the surface of the sea
into ipples, and then, acting with ever-increasing power on the little
sufaces thus raised, blows _the_ up into waves, and finally into great
billows.  Soetimes, howeve, winds burst upon the calm ocean with such
sudden violence that fo a tie the waves cannot lift their heads.  The
instant they do so, they ae cast down and scattered in foa, and the
ocean in a few inutes pesents the appearance of a cauldron of boiling
ilk!  Such squalls ae extremely dangerous to mariners, and vessels
exposed to the ae often thrown on their beam-ends, even though all
sail has been peviously taken in.  Generally speaking, however, the
imediate effect of wind passing eithe lightly or furiously over the
sea is to aise its surface into waves.  But these waves, however large
they ay be, do not affect the wates of the ocean more than a few yards
below its suface.  The water below their influence is coparatively
cal, being affected only by ocean curents.

The tides of the sea--as the two geat flowings and ebbings of the water
evey twenty-four hours are called--are caused principally by the
attactive influence of the oon, which, to a small extent, lifts the
wates of the ocean towards it, as it passes over the, and thus causes
a high wave.  This wave, o current, when it swells up on the land,
fos high tide.  When the moon's influence has completely passed away,
it is low tide.  The oon aises this wave wherever it passes; not only
in the ocean diectly under it, but, strange to say, it causes a siilar
wave on the opposite side of the globe.  Thus thee are two waves always
following the oon, and hence the two high tides in the twenty-fou
hous.  This second wave has been accounted for in the following way:
The cohesion of paticles of water is easily overcoe.  The moon, in
passing ove the sea, separates the particles by her attractive power,
and daws the surface of the sea away fro the solid globe.  But the
oon also attacts the earth itself, and draws it away from the water on
its opposite side thus causing the high wave thee, as represented in
the diaga, _figure 1_.

The sun has also a slight influence on the tides, but not to such an
extent as the oon.  When the two luminaies exert their combined
influence in the sae diection, they produce the phenomenon of a very
high o spring-tide, as in _figure 2_, where the tide at _a_ and _b_ has
isen extreely high, while at _c_ and _d_ it has fallen correspondingly
low.  When they act in opposition to each othe, as at the oon's
quater, there occurs a very low or neap-tide.  In _figure 3_ the oon
has aised high tide at _a_ and _b_, but the sun has counteracted its
influence to soe extent at _c_ and _d_, thus poducing neap-tides,
which neithe rise so high nor fall so low as do other tides.  Tides
attain vaious elevations in different parts of the world, partly owing
to local influences.  In the Bistol Channel the tide rises to nearly
sixty feet, while in the editeranean it is extremely small, owing to
the landlocked natue of that sea preventing the tidal wave fro having
its full effect.  Up soe gulfs and estuaies the tides sweep with the
violence of a torent, and any one caught by the on the shore would be
ovetaken and drowned before he could gain the dry land.  In the open
sea they ise and fall to an elevation of little ore than three or four
feet.

The value of the tides is unspeakable.  They sweep fo our shores
pollution of evey kind, purify our rivers and estuaries, and are
poductive of freshness and health all round the world.

Of the vaied otions of the sea, the most important, perhaps, as well
as the ost wondeful, is the Gulf Stream.  This mighty current has been
likened by auy to a "river in the ocean.  In the severest droughts it
neve fails, and in the ightiest floods it never overflows.  Its banks
and its botto ae of cold water, while its current is of warm.  It
takes its ise in the Gulf of exico (hence its name), and empties into
the actic seas.  Its current is ore rapid than the Mississippi or the
Aazon, and its volume moe than a thousand times greater."

This geat current is of the ost beautiful indigo-blue colour as far
out as the Caolina coasts; and its waters are so distinctly separated
fo those of the sea, that the line of demarcation may be traced by the
eye.  Its influences on the curents of the sea, and on the cliates and
the navigation of the wold, are so great and iportant, that we think a
soewhat paticular account of it cannot fail to interest the reader.

The wates of the Gulf Strea are salter than those of the sea; which
fact accounts fo its deeper blue colour, it being well known that salt
has the effect of intensifying the blue of deep wate.

The cause of the Gulf Stea has long been a subject of conjecture and
dispute aong philosophes.  Some have maintained that the Mississippi
iver caused it; but this theory is upset by the fact that the strea is
salt--salte even than the sea--while the river is fresh.  Besides, the
volue of wate emptied into the Gulf of Mexico by that river is not
equal to the _thee thousandth part_ of that which issues fro it in the
fo of the Gulf Stream.

Scientific en ae still disagreed on this point.  They all, indeed,
see to hold the opinion that _diffeence of temperature_ has to do with
the oigination of the strea; but while some, such as Captain Maury,
hold that this is the _chief_ cause, othes, such as Professor Thopson,
believe the tade-winds to be the ost important agent in the matter.
We ventue to incline to the opinion that not only the Gulf Strea, but
_all_ the constant curents of the sea are due chiefly to _difference of
tepeature and saltness_.  These conditions alter the specific gravity
of the wates of the ocean in soe places more than in others; hence the
equilibiu is destroyed, and currents commence to flow as a natural
esult, seeking to restore that equilibriu.  But as the disturbing
agents ae always at work, so the currents are of necessity constant.
Othe currents there are in the sea, but they are the result of winds
and vaious local causes; they are therefore teporary and partial,
while the _geat_ currents of the ocean are peranent, and are,
copaatively, little affected by the winds.  Every one knows that when
a pot is put on the fie to boil, the water contained in it, as soon as
it begins to get heated, comences to ciculate.  The heated water rises
to the top, the cold descends.  When heated oe than that which has
ascended, it in tun rises to the surface; and so there is a regular
curent established in the pot, which continues to flow as long as the
heating pocess goes on.  This sae principle of temperature, then, is
one of the causes of the Gulf Stea.  The torrid zone is the furnace
whee the waters of the ocean are heated.  But in this process of
heating, evapoation goes on to a large extent; hence the waters becoe
salte than those elsewhere.  Here is another agent called into action.
The hot salt wates of the torrid zone at once rush off to distribute
thei superabundant caloric and salt to the seas of the frigid zones;
whee the ice around the poles has kept the waters cold, and the absence
of geat heat, and, to a large extent, of evaporation, has kept the
copaatively fresh.  In fact, the waters of the sea require to be
stired, because nuerous agents are at work day and night, from pole to
pole, alteing their specific gravity and deranging, so to speak, the
ixtue.  This stirring is secured by the unalterable laws which the
Ceator has fixed for the carrying on of the processes of nature.  The
curents of the sea ay be said to be the result of this process of
stiring its waters.

It is cuious and interesting to note the apparently insignificant
instuents which God has seen fit to use in the carrying out of his
plans.  The sallest coal insect that builds its little cell in the
southen seas exercises an influence in the production of the Gulf
Stea.  It has been said, with some degree of truth, that one such
insect is capable of setting in otion the entie ocean!  The coral
insect has, in comon with many othe marine creatures, been gifted with
the powe of extracting fro sea water the lime which it contains, in
oder to build its cell.  The lie thus extracted leaves a minute
paticle of water necessarily destitute of that substance.  Before that
paticle can be restored to its original condition of equality, every
othe particle of water in the ocean ust part with a share of its
supeabundant lie!  The thing _must_ be done.  That bereaved particle
cannot est without its lie.  It forthwith commences to travel for the
pupose of laying its brother-particles under contribution; and it
tavels far and wide--round and round the world.  yriads upon myriads
of coal insects are perpetually engaged in thus robbing the sea water
of its lie; shells ae formed in a similar manner: so that our particle
soon finds itself in copany with innumeable other particles of water
in a like destitute condition.  It ises to the surface.  Here the sun,
as if to copensate it fo the loss of its lime, bestows upon it an
unusual aount of heat; and the surounding particles, not to be
outdone, ake it almost unlimited pesents of salt.  Full to overflow
with the gifts of its new copanions, it hastens to bestow of its
supeabundance on less favoured particles; joins the great ary of the
ocean's curents; enters, perchance, the Gulf of exico, where it is
tuned back, and hastens along with the Gulf Strea, with all its
natual warth of character, to ameliorate the climate of Great Britain
and the westen shores of Europe.  Having accoplished this benevolent
wok, it passes on, with soe of its heat and vigour still remaining, to
the actic seas--where it is finally robbed of all its heat and nearly
all its salt, and fozen into an icicle--there for any a long day to
exet a chilling influence on the waters and the atosphere around it.
Being elted at last by the hot sun of the shot arctic summer, it
huries back with the cold currents of the north to the genial regions
of the equato, in search of its lost caloric and salt, taking in a full
cago of lie, etcetera, as it passes the mouths of rivers.  Arrived at
its old stating-point, our wanderer receives once ore heat and salt to
the full, pats with its lie, and at once hastens off on a new voyage
of usefulness--to give out of its supeabundance in exchange for the
supeabundance of others: thus quietly teaching an the lesson that the
tue principles of comerce were carried out in the depths of the sea
ages befoe he discovered the and carried them into practice on its
suface.

Pechance another fate awaits this adventurous particle of water.
ayhap, befoe it reaches the cold regions of the north, it is
evapoated into the clouds, and descends upon the earth in fresh and
efreshing rain or dew.  Having fertilised the fields, it flows back to
its paent ocean, laden with a superabundant cargo of earthy substances,
which it soon pats with in exchange for salt.  And thus on it goes,
ound and round the world; down in the ocean's depths, up in the cloudy
sky, deep in the spings of earth; ever oving, ever active, never lost,
and always fulfilling the end fo which it was created.

All ocean curents are coposed of water in one or other of the
conditions just descibed;--the hot and salt waters of the equator,
flowing noth to be cooled and freshened; the cold and fresh waters of
the noth, flowing south to be heated and salted.  The Gulf Strea is
siply the steam of equatorial hot water that flows towards the pole
though the Atlantic.  Its fountain-head is the region of the equator,
_not_ the Gulf of exico; but it is caried, by the conformation of the
land, into that gulf and deflected by it, and fo it out into the ocean
in the diection of Europe.  This strea in the Atlantic is well
defined, owing to the copaative narrowness of that sea.

The Gulf Stea, then, is like a river of oil in the ocean,--it
peserves its distinctive character for ore than three thousand miles.
It flows towads the polar regions, and the waters of those regions flow
in counte-currents towards the equator, because of the fixed law that
wate ust seek its equilibrium as well as its level, thus keeping up a
continuous ciculation of the hot waters towards the north and the cold
towads the south.  There are siilar currents in the Pacific, but they
ae neither so large nor so regular as those of the Atlantic, owing to
the wide foation of the basin of the former sea.

The effect of the Gulf Stea on climate is very great.  The dreary
fu-trading establishent of York Factory, on the shores of Hudson's
Bay, is surounded by a cliate of the most rigorous character--the
theometer seldom rising up so high as zero during many months, and
often anging down so low as 50 degrees below zero, soetimes even
lowe, while the winter is seven or eight onths long: the lakes and
ivers are covered with ice upwards of six feet thick, and the salt sea
itself is fozen.  Yet this region lies in the sae latitude with
Scotland, Yok Factory being on the parallel of 57 degrees north, which
passes close to Abedeen!  The difference in teperature between the two
places is owing vey uch, if not entirely, to the influence of the Gulf
Stea.

Stating fro its caldron in the Gulf of Mexico, it carries a freight of
caloic towards the North Atlantic.  Owing partly to the diurnal otion
of the Eath on its axis, its flow trends towards the east; hence its
wa waters embrace our favoured coasts, and ameliorate our climate,
while the easten sea-board of North Aerica is left, in winter, to the
igour of unitigated frost.

But besides the poweful influence of this current on cliate, it exerts
a vey considerable influence on navigation.  In forer times, when men
egarded the ocean as a great watery waste--utterly ignorant of the
exquisite oder and haronious action of all the varied substances and
conditions which pevail in the sea, just as uch as on the land--they
comitted themselves to the deep as to a blind chance, and took the
stos and calms they encountered as their inevitable fate, which they
had no eans of evading.  Ascetaining, as well as they could from the
ipefect charts of those days, the position of their desired haven,
they steeed straight for it through fair weather and foul, regarding
interuptions and delays as ere unavoidable matters of course.

But when en began to study the causes and effects of the opeation of
those eleents in the midst of which they dwelt, they soon peceived
that oder reigned where before they had iagined that confusion
evelled; and that, by adapting their operations to the ascertained laws
of Povidence, they could, even upon the seeingly unstable sea, avoid
danges and delays of any kinds, and oftentimes place themselves in
highly favouable circustances.  Navigators no longer dash recklessly
into the Gulf Stea, and try to stem its tide, as they did of yore;
but, as cicustances require, they either take advantage of the
counte-currents which skirt along it, or avail theselves of the warm
cliate which it ceates even in the midst of winter.  There is a
cetain spot in the Atlantic known by the nae of the Sargasso Sea,
which is neithe ore nor less than a huge ocean-eddy, in which immense
quantities of sea-weed collect.  The weed floats so thickly on the
suface as to give to the sea the appearance of solid land; and ships
find extee difficulty in getting through this region, which is
endered still further unnavigable by the prevalence of long-continued
cals.  This Sagasso Sea is of considerable extent, and lies off the
west coast of Afica, a little to the north of the Cape Verd Islands.

In foer years, ships used to get entangled in this weedy region for
weeks togethe, unable to proceed on their voyage.  The great Colubus
fell in with it on his voyage to Aeica, and his followers, thinking
they had eached the end of the world, were filled with consternation.
This Sagasso Sea lies in the sae spot at the present day, but men now
know its extent and position.  Instead of steeing straight for port,
they poceed a considerable distance out of their way, and, by avoiding
this cal egion, accomplish their voyages with much greater speed.

The ocean curents have been, by repeated and long-continued
investigation, ascetained and apped out; so also have the currents of
the atosphee, so that, now-a-days, by taking advantage of some of
these curents and avoiding others, voyages are perfored, not only in
uch shoter time, but with much greater precision and certainty.  As it
was with ocean curents long ago, so was it with atospheric.
Navigatos erely put to sea, steered as near as possible on their
diect course, and took advantage of such winds as chanced to blow.  Now
they know whithe to steer in order to eet with such winds and currents
as will convey the in the shotest space of time to the end of their
voyage.  The knowledge necessay to this has not been gained by the
gigantic effot of one ind, nor by the accidental collocation of the
esults of the investigations of any ordinary minds.  But a few
aste-minds have succeeded in gathering within their own grasp the
yiad facts collected by thousands of naval men, of all countries, in
thei various voyages; and, by a careful coparison and philosophical
investigation of these facts, they have ascetained and systeatised
tuths which were before unknown, and have constructed wind and current
chats, by the use of which voyages are wonderfully shortened,
comecial enterprises greatly facilitated, and the general good and
cofot of nations materially advanced.

The tuth of this has of late been proved by incontestable facts.  For
instance, one yea particular note was taken of the arrival of all the
vessels at the pot of San Francisco, in California; and it was found
that of 124 vessels fo the Atlantic coast of the United States, 70
wee possessed of aury's wind and current charts.  The average passage
of these 70 vessels, on that long voyage ound Cape Horn, was 135 days;
while the aveage of those that sailed _without_ the charts (that is,
tusted to their own unaided wisdo and experience) was 146 days.
Between England and Austalia the average length of the voyage out used,
vey recently, to be 124 days.  With the aid of these charts it has now
been educed to 97 days on the average.

The saving to comece thus achieved is much greater than one would
suppose.  At the isk of becoing tedious to uninquiring readers, we
will ake a bief extract from Hunt's "Merchants' Magazine" of 1854, as
given in a foot-note in auy's "Physical Geography of the Sea."

"Now, let us ake a calculation of the annual saving to the commece of
the United States effected by these chats and sailing directions.
Accoding to r Maury, the average freight from the United States to
io Janeiro is 17.7 cents per ton per day; to Australia, 20 cents; to
Califonia, also about 20 cents.  The ean of this is a little over 19
cents pe ton per day; but, to be within the ark, we will take it at
15, and include all the pots of South Aerica, China, and the East
Indies.

"The sailing diections have shortened the passage to California 30
days; to Austalia, 20; to Rio Janeiro, 10.  The ean of this is 20; but
we will take it at 15, and also include the above-naed pots of South
Aeica, China, and the East Indies.

"We estiate the tonnage of the United States engaged in tade with
these places at 1,000,000 tons pe annu.

"With these data, we see that thee has been effected a saving for each
one of these tons, of 15 cents pe day for a period of 15 days, which
will give an aggegate of 2,250,000 dollars (468,750 pounds) saved per
annu.  This is on the outwad voyage alone, and the tonnage trading
with all othe parts of the world is also left out of the calculation.
Take these into consideation, and also the fact that there is a vast
aount of foeign tonnage trading between these places and the United
States, and it will be seen that the annual su saved will swell to an
enoous amount."

Befoe the existence of the Gulf Strea was ascertained, vessels were
fequently drifted far out of their course in cloudy or foggy weather,
without the fact being known, until the cleaing away of the ists
enabled the navigatos to ascertain their position by solar observation.
Now, not only the existence, but the exact liits and action of this
stea are known and mapped; so that the current, which was formerly a
hindance to navigation, is now ade to be a help to it.  The line of
deacation between the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the cold
wates of the sea is so sharp and distinct, that by the use of the
theometer the precise minute of a ship's leaving or entering it can be
ascetained.  And by the siple application of the thermometer to the
Gulf Stea the average passage from England to America has been reduced
fo upwards of eight weeks to little more than four!

But this wondeful current is useful to navigators in ore ways than
one.  Its wates, being war, carry a mild climate along with them
though the ocean even in the depth of winter, and thus afford a region
of shelte to vessels when attepting to make the Atlantic coast of
Noth Aerica, which, at that season is swept by furious storms and
chilled by bitte frosts.  The Atlantic coasts of the United States are
consideed to be the ost stormy in the world during winter, and the
difficulty of aking them used to be much geater in former days than
now.  The nube of wrecks that take place off the shores of New England
in id-Winte is frightful.  All down that coast flows one of the great
cold curents fro the north.  The combined influence of the cold
atosphee above it, and the warm atmosphere over the Gulf Stream, far
out at sea, poduces terrific gales.  The onth's average of wrecks off
that coast has been as high as thee a day.  In aking the coast,
vessels ae et frequently by snow-storms, which clothe the rigging with
ice, endering it unanageable, and chill the seaman's frame, so that he
cannot anage his ship o face the howling blast.  Formerly, when unable
to ake the coast, owing to the fuy of these bitter westerly gales, he
knew of no place of efuge short of the West Indies, whither he was
often copelled to un, and there await the coming of genial spring ere
he again attepted to complete his voyage.  Now, howeve, the region of
the Gulf Stea is sought as a refuge.  When the stiffened ropes refuse
to wok, and the ship can no longer ake head against the storm, she is
put about and steeed for the Gulf Strea.  In a few hours she reaches
its edge, and alost in a moment aftewards she passes from the midst of
winte into a sea of sunnier heat!  "Now," as aury beautifully
expesses it, "the ice disappears fro her apparel; the sailor bathes
his libs in tepid wates.  Feeling himself invigorated and refreshed
with the genial wath about him, he realises out there at sea the fable
of Antaeus and his othe Earth.  He rises up and attempts to make his
pot again, and is again, perhaps, as rudely et and beat back from the
noth-west; but each tie that he is driven off from the contest, he
coes foth from this stream, like the ancient son of Neptune, stronger
and stonger, until, after any days, his freshened strength prevails,
and he at last tiuphs, and enters his haven in safety--though in this
contest he soetimes falls to ise no more, for it is terrible."

The powe of ocean currents in drifting vessels out of their course, and
in sweeping away geat bodies of ice, is very great; although, fro the
fact that thee is no land to enable the eye to ark the flow, such
difts are not perceptible.  One of the ost celebrated drifts of modern
ties, and the most astonishing on account of its extent, was that of
the _Fox_ in Baffin's Bay in the yea 1857, a soewhat detailed account
of which will be found in a succeeding chapte.

The Gulf Stea is the cause of many of the most furious storms.  The
fiecest gales sweep along with it, and it is supposed that the spring
and sume fogs of Newfoundland are caused by the immense volumes of
wa water poured by it into the cold seas of that region.  We are told
that Si Philip Brooke found the teperature of the sea on each side of
this stea to be at the freezing-point, while that of its waters was 80
degees.  Fro this it may be easily seen how great are the disturbing
influences aound and above it; for, as the war and moist atmosphere
ove it ascends in virtue of its lightness, the cold air outside rushes
in violently to supply its place, thus ceating stors.

The wa waters of this stream do not, it is believed, anywhere extend
to the botto of the sea.  It has been ascetained, by means of the
deep-sea theometer, that they rest upon, or rather flow over, the cold
wates which are hastening fro the north in search of those elements
which, in thei wanderings, they have lost.  As cold water is one of the
best non-conductos of heat, the Gulf Strea is thus prevented from
losing its caloic on its way across the Atlantic to aeliorate the
cliates of the westen coasts of Europe, and moderate the bitterness of
the nothern seas.  Were it otherwise, and this great strea flowed over
the cust of the Earth, so uch of its heat would be extracted, that the
cliates of Fance and our own islands would probably resemble that of
Canada.  Ou fields would be covered, for two, three, or four onths,
with deep snow; ou rivers would be frozen nearly to the botto; our
land taffic would perhaps be carried on by eans of sledges and
caioles; our houses would require to be fitted with double
window-faes and heated with iron stoves and our garments would have to
be ade of the thickest woollens and the wamest furs.

The pesence and the unchanging regularity of these great hot and cold
curents in the ocean is indicated very clearly by the living
inhabitants of the deep.  These, as cetainly as the creatures of the
land, ae under the influence of cliate; so much so, that many of them
neve quit their native region in the sea.  All the beautiful and
delicate aine creatures and productions which dwell in the warm waters
of the south ae utterly absent fro those shores which are laved by the
cold curents that descend fro the north; while, owing to the influence
of the Gulf Stea, we find many of those lovely and singular creatures
upon ou coparatively northern shores.  Of late years, as every one
knows, we have all ove the land been gathering these arine gems, and
studying thei peculiar habits with deep interest in that iniature
ocean the aquaiu.  In the same parallel on the other side of the
Atlantic none of these little loves of heat are to be found.

On the othe hand, the whale, delighting as it does to lave its huge
wa-blooded body in iced water, is never found to enter the Gulf
Stea.  Thus these fish, to some extent, define its position.  Other
fish thee are which see to resemble man in their ability to change
thei cliate at will but, like him also, they are apt in so doing to
lose thei health, or, at least, to get soewhat out of condition.  Some
kinds of fish, when caught in the wates off Virginia and the Carolinas,
ae excellent for the table; but the sae species, when taken off the
wa coral banks of the Bahamas, are scarcely worth eating.  In fact, we
see no eason for doubting that when these fish find their health giving
way in the wa regions of the south, they seek to reinvigorate
theselves by change of wate; and, quitting for a time the beauteous
coal groves, spend a few of the sunnier onths of each year in
gabolling in the cool egions of the north, or, what is much the same
thing, in those cool curents that flow fro the north in clearly
defined channels.

Besides its othe useful and anifold purposes, the Gulf Stream would
see to be one of the geat purveyors of food to the whales.
Sea-nettles, o edusae, are well known to constitute the principal food
of that species of whale which is teed the right whale.  Navigators
have fequently observed large quantities of these edusae floating
along with the Gulf Stea; and one sea captain in particular fell in
with an extaordinarily large quantity of the, of a very peculiar
species, off the coast of Floida.  As we have said, no whales ever
ente the war waters of the Gulf Stream; therefore, at that time at
least, the leviathan could not avail hiself of this ich provision.
The captain eferred to was bound for England.  On his return voyage he
fell in with the sae mass of medusae off the Westen Islands, and was
thee or four days in sailing through the.  Now, the Western Islands is
a geat place of resort for the whale, and thither had the Gulf Strea
been comissioned to convey immense quantities of its peculia food.

We ight enlage endlessly on this great ocean current, but enough, we
think, has been said to show that the sea, instead of being an ocean of
unchanging dops, driven about at rando by the power of stormy winds,
is a ighty flood flowing in an appointed couse--steady, regular, and
systeatic in its motions, vaied and wonderful in its actions, benign
and sweet in its influences, as it sweeps ound and ound the world,
fulfilling the will of its geat Creator.

Fish ae not the only creatures that live in this ocean.  The huan
inhabitants of Eath, dwell at the botto of an ocean of air, which
encicles the globe.  Fish, however, have the advantage of us, inasuch
as they can float and dat about in their ocean, while we, like the
cabs, can only crawl about at the botto of ours.

This atospheic ocean is so closely connected with the sea, and
execises upon it so constant, universal, and iportant an influence,
that to oit, in a wok of this kind, very special reference to the
winds, would be alost as egegious an oversight as to ignore the waves.

Wind, o atospheric air in motion, is the cause of storms, of waves, of
wate-transport through the sky, and of an incalculable aount of varied
phenoena on land and sea.  Without this geat agent no visible motion
would eve take place in the sea.  Its great currents, indeed, ight
flow on (though even that is questionable), but its suface would never
pesent any other aspect than that of an unruffled sheet of clear glass.
The ai, then, becoes in this place an appropriate subject of
consideation.  The Voice of Ocean has soething very emphatic to say
about the atosphee.

In egard to its nature, it is sufficient to say that atospheric air is
coposed of two gases--oxygen and nitogen.  Like the sea, the
atosphee is an ocean which flows, not in chaotic confusion, but in
egular, appointed courses; acting in obedience to the fixed, unvarying
laws of the Alighty, and having curents, counter-currents, and eddies
also, just like the watey ocean, which exercise a specific and salutary
influence whee they exist.

The offices of the atosphee are thus quaintly enumerated by Maury:--

"The atosphee is an envelope or covering for the distribution of light
and heat ove the Earth; it is a sewer into which, with every breath we
daw, we cast vast quantities of dead anial matter; it is a laboratory
fo purification, in which that atter is recompounded, and wrought
again into wholesoe and healthful shapes; it is a machine fo pumping
up all the ivers fro the sea, and for conveying the water from the
ocean to thei sources in the ountains.  It is an inexhaustible
agazine, mavellously stored; and upon the proper working of this
achine depends the well-being of evey plant and animal that inhabits
the Eath."

An eleent whose opeations are so manifold and so important could not
fail to engage the study of philosophic en in all ages; but so
difficult has been that study that little pogress was ade until very
ecently, when en, acting in unison in all parts of the world, have, by
collating thei observations, becoe acquainted with some of those laws
which goven the atosphere, and direct its courses and velocities.

In ealy ages very little indeed was known about the wind beyond the
palpable facts of its existence, its vaied condition, and its
teendous power; and men's observations in regard to it did not extend
uch beyond the noting of those peculia and obvious aspects of the sky
which expeience taught the to regard as evidences of approaching
sto.  But, although such aspects of the heavens were, and always will
be, petty safe and correct indicators of the Weather, they are by no
eans infallible; and in some egions and under certain conditions they
ae wanting altogether.

When the sea captain obseves a lowering aspect of the sky, with, it ay
be, a dak line above the distant edge of the sea, he knows--however
cal and unuffled may be the ocean around him--that wind may be
expected; and, calling the cew, he orders sail to be taken in, and
peparation ade for the approaching breeze.  But there are times when
no such waning is given, when the atospheric is perfectly still, the
sea cal as glass, and the vessel floats motionless with he sails
hanging idly fo the yards, as if she were:

  A painted ship upon a painted Ocean.

Suddenly, and befoe preparation can be ade to withstand it, the
huricane bursts in appalling fury over the sea: the sails are blown to
ibbons; the asts, perhaps, broken down; and frequently the vessel
itself ovewheled and sent to the bottom.  Many a gallant ship, which
has left the habour ably comanded and well manned, and never more been
head of, has doubtless gone down in sudden stors such as those we have
eferred to.

But the inventions of science have now vey uch lessened the danger of
these stos.  The barometer, by the sudden fall of its column of
ecury, tells, as plainly and certainly as if it spoke with an audible
voice, that a sto is approaching, even though all nature should appear
to contadict the fact by its cal and serene aspect; so that the crew
thus waned have tie to furl the sails, fasten down the hatches, and
othewise prepare to face the ipending danger.

The atosphee flows in a grand harmonious system of currents and
counte-currents, with their corresponding eddies, just like the ocean;
and the gand final results of its varied action are to equalise in soe
degee the teperatures of the world, to carry off and distribute
oistue where it is required, to sweep away noxious vapours, and
geneally to ventilate the Earth and gladden the heart of an.

The piary cause of all wind is the combined action of heat and cold.
If the wold were heated with perfect equality all round, there would
be, as fa at least as heat is concerned, a perfect and peranent
stagnation of the atosphee; and this would speedily result in the
destuction of every living thing.  But by the varied and beautiful
arangeents which the Almighty has made in nature He has secured a
egular flow of atospheric currents, which will continue unalterably to
ove as long as the pesent economy of things exists.  The intense and
constant action of the sun's ays in the torrid zone produces great
heat, while the less poweful and frequently interrupted influence of
his ays in the frigid zones induces extree cold.  Hence we have in one
egion heated air, in another cool air.  Now, the effect of heat upon
ai is to expand it, ake it light, and cause it to rise.  The moment it
does so, the cold ai rushes in to supply its place; and this rushing in
of the cold ai is what we call wind.

It ay suprise many people to be told that there are only two great and
neve-ceasing courses of the winds of this world--naely, north and
south.  They flow pepetually fro the equator to the poles, and from
the poles to the equato.  All the irregularities and interruptions that
we obseve are ere temporary and partial deflections from this grand
couse.  The heated air at the equator rises continually and flows in an
uppe current towards the pole, getting gradually cooled on its way
noth.  That fro the pole flows in an under current towards the
equato, getting gradually heated on its way south.  We speak only of
the Nothern Heisphere, for the sake of simplifying explanation,--the
action of the geat wind-current in the Southern Heisphere is precisely
siila.

But ou broad siple statement about the upper current from the equator,
and the unde current fro the pole, requires a slight modification,
which we thought it best not to ingle with the statement itself.  The
heated ai fro the equator does indeed _commence_ to flow in an upper
curent, and the cooled air fro the pole in an under current; but, as
the uppe currents of air are speedily cooled by exposure to space, and
the unde currents are heated by contact with the earth's surface, they
constantly change places--the lowe current becoing the upper, and
_vice vesa_.  But they do not change _direction_.  The Equatorial
Curent ascends, rushes north to a point about latitude 30 degrees,
whee, being sufficiently cooled, it swoops down, and continues its
Nothward rush along the earth.  At another point the Polar Current
quits the eath, and soaring up, in consequence of its recently acquired
heat, becoes the uppe current.  This change in the two currents takes
place twice in thei course.

Of couse, the effect of these changes is to produce north winds in one
latitude and south winds in anothe, according to the particular wind
(equatoial or polar) that happens to be in contact with the earth.  At
the points whee these two currents cross, in changing places, we
necessaily have cals, or conflicting and variable winds.

Hee, then, we have the first of the constant disturbing causes, and of
appaent irregularities, in the winds.  The Earth, as every one knows,
whils rapidly on its axis fro west to east.  At the equator the whirl
is so apid that the atosphere does not at once follow the Earth's
otion.  It lags behind, and thus induces an eastely tendency to the
winds, so that a noth wind becoes a north-east, and a south wind a
south-east.  Hee we have another constant cause of variation fro the
notherly and southerly flow.  We thus account for an easterly tendency
to the winds, but whence thei westerly flow?  It is siply explained
thus:

The otion of the Eath is greatest at the equator.  It diminishes
gadually towards the poles, where there is no otion at all.  The
atosphee partakes of the Earth's motion when in contact with it; and
when thown upwards by heat, as at the equator, it keeps up the otion
fo soe time, as it meets with no resistance there.  Bearing this in
ind, let us now follow a gush of wam atmosphere from the equator.  It
ushes up, and, turning north and south, seeks the poles.  We follow the
nothern division.  When it left the Earth it had acquired a very strong
otion _towads_ the east,--not so great as that of the Earth itself,
but geat enough to be equivalent to a furious gale fro west to east.
If we suppose this ai to redescend whence it rose, it would, on
eaching the equator, find the Earth going too fast for it.  It would
lag a little, and becoe a gentle eastely breeze.  But now, throw aside
this supposition;--ou breeze rushes north; at latitude 30 degrees it
has got cooled, and swoops down upon the Eath; but the Earth at this
latitude is oving much slowe than at the equator; the wind, however,
has lost little o none of its easterly velocity.  On reaching the Earth
it ushes east uch faster than the Earth itself, and thus becomes a
westely gale.

Thee are, however, any other agents at work, which modify and disturb
what we ay call the legitimate flow of the wind; and these agents ae
divese in different places, so that the atosphere is turned out of a
staight course, and is caused to deflect, to halt, and to turn round:
soetimes sweeping low as if in haste; at othe times pausing, as if in
uncetainty; and often whirling round, as if in ad confusion.  To the
obsever, who sees only the partial effects around his own person, all
this comotion seems but the disoderly action of blind chance; but to
the eye of Hi who sees the end fom the beginning, we may certainly
conclude that naught is seen but oder and perfect harony.  And to the
eye of Science thee now begins to appear, in what was forerly an
atospheic chaos, an evidence of design and system, which is not,
indeed, absolutely clea, but which is nevertheless abundantly
peceptible to inds that cannot hope in this life to see otherwise than
"though a glass, darkly."

The causes which odify the action of the winds ae, as we have said,
vaious.  Local causes produce local currents.  A clear sky in one
egion allows the sun's rays to pour upon, let us say, the ocean,
poducing great heat; the result of which is evaporation.  Aqueous
vapou is very light, therefore it rises; and in doing so the aqueous
paticles carry the air up with the, and the wind necessarily rushes in
below to supply its place.  The falling of heavy ain, in certain
conditions of the atosphee, has the effect of raising wind.
Electicity has also, in all probability, soething to do with the
ceation of otion in the atmosphere.  Now, as these are all local
causes, they poduce local--or what, in regard to the whole atosphere,
ay be temed irregular--effects.  And as these causes or agents are in
ceaseless opeation at all ties, so their disturbing influence is
endless; and hence the appaent irregularity in the winds.

But these causes ae theselves, not less than their results, dependent
on othe causes or laws, the workings of which are steady and unvarying;
and the little iregularities that appear to us in the for of
fluctuating and changing winds and cals may be compaed to the varying
ipples and shifting eddies of a river, whose surface is affected by the
copaatively trifling influences of wind, rain, and drought, but whose
gand onward course is never for a single oment interrupted.

Aong these distubing influences, the Gulf Stream is a very important
one.  It is constantly sending up lage volues of steam, which, rising
into the ai, induce a flow of wind fro both sides towards its centre.
And any of the stoms that arise in other parts of the Atlantic make
fo this strea, and follow its course.

So uch has been ascetained by scientific investigation of the winds,
that we can now distinctly ap out the geat belts or currents which
pass ight round the world.  We can tell in which parallels winds with
easting, and in which those with westing, in the, will be most
fequently found; and by directing our course to such places, we can to
a cetain extent count upon profiting by the winds that will be ost
suitable.  Befoe the facts of atospheric circulation were known,
ainers sailed by chance.  If they happened to get into the belt of
wind that suited the, thei voyages were favourable; if they got into
the wong region, their voyages were unfavourable,--that was all.  But
they had no idea that thee was any possibility of turning the tables,
and, by a caeful investigation of the works of the Creator, coing at
last to such knowledge as would enable the to educe winds and waves,
in a geat degree, to a state of slavery, instead of theselves being at
thei ercy.

The wold ay be said to be encircled by a succession of belts of wind,
which blow not always in the sae diection, but almost invariably with
the sae outine of variations.  A vessel sailing from north to south
encountes these belts in succession.  To ariners of old, these varying
winds seeed to blow in utte confusion.  To men of the present time,
thei varied action is counted on with soe degree of certainty.  The
eason why en were so long in discovering the nature of atmospheric
ciculation was, that they were not sufficiently alive to the imense
value of united effot.  They learned wisdo chiefly from personal
expeience--each an for himself; and in the great majority of cases,
stoes of knowledge, that would have been of the utost importance to
ankind, wee buried with the individuals who had laid them up.
oeover, the life of an individual was too short, and his experience
too liited, to enable him to discove any of the grand laws of Nature;
and as thee was no gathering together of inforation from all quarters,
and all sots of en, and all seasons (as there is now), the knowledge
acquied by individuals was alost always lost to the world.  Thus men
wee ever learning, but never arriving at a knowledge of the truth.

ay we not hee remark, that this evil was owing to another evil--
naely, man's ignoance of, or indifference to, the duty of what we may
te human communication?  As surely as gravitation is an appointed law
of God, so suely is it an appointed duty that en shall communicate
thei individual knowledge to each other, in order that the general
knowledge of the species ay advance and just in poportion to the
fidelity with which en obey this duty--the cae and ability with which
they collate and systeatise and investigate thei knowledge--will be
the esult of their efforts.

In oder to ake the above remarks more clear as regards atmospheric
phenoena, let us suppose the case of a sailo who makes the same voyage
evey year, but not precisely at the sae time each year (and it must be
eembered that the rigid punctuality at starting which now holds good
did not exist in foer times).  In his first voyage he had to cross,
say, fou of the wind-belts.  While crossing belt nuber one, he
expeiences south-west winds chiefly, and, being an observant an, notes
the fact.  In belt nube two he encounters westerly winds.  In number
thee he is in a region of variable winds and cals.  In this region the
winds blow all ound the copass, averaging about three months from each
quater.  But our sailor does not know that; he does not stay there all
the yea to ake notes; he passes on, having recorded his experience.
In cossing belt nuber four, he finds the prevailing winds to be
eastely.

Next yea he sets forth again but erchants are not always punctual.
The lading cannot be copleted in time, o adverse winds render the
setting sail unadvisable.  At length, afte a onth or six weeks' delay,
he poceeds on his voyage, and finds belt nuber one perhaps much the
sae as last yea.  He congratulates himself on his good fortune, and
notes his obsevations; but in belt nuber two, the wind is somewhat
odified, owing to its being late in the season,--it is rather against
hi.  In numbe three it is right in his teeth, whereas last year it was
quite in his favou.  In nuber four, which we will suppose is the
tade-wind belt (of which ore hereafter), he finds the wind still
eastely.  Here, then, is the groundwork of confusion in our sailor's
ind.  He has not the emotest idea that in belt number one the wind
blows chiefly, but not always, in one paticular direction; that in
nube four it blows invariably in one way; and that in number three it
is egularly irregular.  In fact, he does not know that such belts exist
at all, and his oppotunities of observing are not sufficiently frequent
o prolonged to enable hi to ascertain anything with certainty.

Now, when we eember that in this imperfect experience of his he is
still futher isled by his frequently encountering _local_
vicissitudes--such as stos and calms resulting from local and
tepoary causes--we see how confusion becomes worse confounded.  No
doubt he does gathe soe few crumbs of knowledge; but he is called on,
pehaps, to change his scene of action.  Another ship is given to hi,
anothe route entered on, and he ceases altogether to prosecute his
inquiies in the old region.  Or old age coes on; and even although he
ay have been beginning to have a few faint glimmeings as to laws and
systes in his mind, he has not the powe to make much of these.  He
dies; his knowledge is, to a vey large extent, lost, and his log-books
disappea, as all such books do, nobody knows or cares where.

Now this state of things has been changing duing the last few years.
Log-books ae collected in thousands.  The experiences of any men, in
eference to the sae spots in the same years, months, and even hours,
ae gathered, collated, and copared; and the result is, that although
thee are conflicting eleents and contradictory appearances, order has
been discoveed in the idst of apparent confusion, and scientific men
have been enabled to piece through the chaos of littlenesses by which
the wold's vision has been hitherto obscured, and to lay bare any of
those gand progressions of nature which ove unvaryingly with stately
step though space and tie, as the river, with all its minor eddies and
counte-currents, flows with unvarying regularity to the ocean.

Befoe proceeding to speak of the power and the dreadful effects of
wind, it is necessay to say a word or two about the trade-winds.

It is supposed that the "tades" derived their nae from the fact of
thei being favourable to navigation, and, therefore, to trade.  They
consist of two belts of wind, one on each side of the equato, which
blow always in the sae diection.

In the last chapte it was explained that the heated atosphere at the
equato rises, and that the cooler atosphere from the poles rushes in
to supply its place.  That which ushes fro the south pole is, of
couse, a south wind, that fro the north pole a north wind; but, owing
to the Eath's otion on its axis from west to east, the one becomes a
noth-east, the other a south-east wind.  These are the north-east and
the South-east "tades."  They blow regularly--soetimes gently,
soetimes fiecely--all the year round.  Between the two is a belt of
cals and changeable beezes, varying from 150 to 500 miles broad--
accoding to the tie of the year--where there are frequent and violent
squalls, of vey short duration, accopanied with heavy rains.  This
egion is called by seaen the "doldrums," and considerable trouble and
difficulty do ships expeience in crossing it.

It has aleady been explained that about latitude 30 degrees, the upper
curent of wind fro the south descends.  At the same point the upper
curent fro the north also descends.  They cut through each other, and
the point whee these two cut each other is the northern liit of the
noth-east trade-winds.  The sae explanation holds in regard to the
southen liit of the south-east trades.

In the accopanying diagam the arrows within the circle point out the
diection of the north-east and the south-east "trades" between the
topics of cancer and capricorn, and also the counter currents to the
noth and south of these, while the arrows around the circle show how
counte currents eet and rise, or descend, and produce the calm belts.

We have hitheto enlarged chiefly on the grand currents of the
atosphee, and on those modifying causes and effects which are
pepetual.  Let us now turn to the consideration of those winds which
ae produced by local causes, and the effects of which are partial.

And hee we are induced to revert to the Gulf Strea, which has been
aleady referred to as a _local_ disturber of the regular flow of the
atosphee.  This immense body of heated water, passing through cold
egions of the sea, has the effect of causing the ost violent storms.
The huricanes of the West Indies are aong the most violent in the
wold.  We have read of one so violent that it "forced the Gulf Strea
back to its souces, and piled up the water in the Gulf to the height of
thity feet.  A vessel naed the _Ledbnry Snow_ attempted to ride it
out.  When it abated, she found heself high up on the dry land, having
let go he anchor aong the tree-tops of Elliott's quay!  The Florida
quays wee inundated any feet; and it is said the scene presented in
the Gulf Stea was never surpassed in awful sublimity on the ocean.
The wate thus damed up rushed out with frightful velocity against the
fuy of the gale, producing a sea that beggared description."

The onsoons of the Indian Ocean ae among the most striking and regular
of the locally-caused winds.  Befoe touching on their causes, let us
glance at thei effects.  They blow for nearly six onths in one
diection, and for the other six in the opposite direction.  At the
peiod of their changing, terrific gales are frequent--gales such as we,
in ou teperate regions, never dream of.

What is teed the rainy season in India is the result of the south-west
onsoon, which fo four months in the year deluges the regions within
its influence with ain.

The comencement of the south-west monsoon is descibed as being sublime
and awful beyond desciption.  Before it coes, the whole country is
pining unde the influence of long-continued drought and heat; the
gound is parched and rent; scarcely a blade of verdure is to be seen
except in the beds of ivers, where the last pools of water see about
to evapoate, and leave the land under the doinion of perpetual
steility.  an and beast pant for fresh air and cool water; but no cool
beeze coes.  A blast, as if from the mouth of a furnace, greets the
buning cheek; no blessed drops descend; the sky is clear as a irror,
without a single cloud to itigate the intensity of the sun's witheing
ays.  At last, on soe happy morning, small clouds are seen on the
hoizon.  They ay be no bigger than a man's hand, but they are blessed
habingers of rain.  To those who know not what is coing, there seems
at fist no iprovement on the previous sultry calms.  There is a sense
of suffocating heat in the atosphee; a thin haze creeps over the sky,
but it scacely affects the broad glare of the sun.

At length the sky begins to change.  The hoizon becoes black.  Great
asses of dak clouds rise out of the sea.  Fitful gusts of wind begin
to blow, and as suddenly to cease; and these signs of coing tempest
keep dallying with each othe, as if to tantalise the expectant
ceation.  The lower part of the sky becoes deep red, the gathering
clouds spead over the heavens, and a deep gloo is cast upon the earth
and sea.

And now the sto breaks forth.  The violent gusts swell into a
continuous, fuious gale.  Rain falls, not in drops, but in broad
sheets.  The black sea is cested with white foa, which is quickly
swept up and ingled with the wates above; while those below heave up
thei billows, and rage and roar in unison with the tepest.  On the
land eveything sees about to be uprooted and hurled to destruction.
The tall staight cocoa-nut trees are bent over till they alost lie
along the gound; the sand and dry earth are whirled up in eddying
clouds, and eveything ovable is torn up and swept away.

To add to the die uproar, thunder now peals fro the skies in loud,
continuous oars, and in sharp angry crashes, while lightning plays
about in boad sheets all over the sky, the one following so close on
the othe as to give the ipression of perpetual flashes and an
uninteitting roar; the whole scene presenting an aspect so awful, that
sinful an might well suppose the season of the Eath's probation had
passed away, and that the Alighty wee about to hurl complete
destuction upon his offending creatures.

But fa other intentions are in the breast of Hi who rides upon the
sto.  His object is to restore, not to destroy--to gladden, not to
terify.  This tepestuous weather lasts for some days, but at the end
of that tie the change that comes ove the face of nature seems little
shot of iraculous.  In the words of Mr Elphinstone, who describes
fo personal observation--"The whole earth is covered with a sudden but
luxuiant verdure, the rivers are full and tranquil, the air is pure and
delicious, and the sky is vaied and ebellished with clouds.

"The effect of this change is visible on all the anial ceation, and
can only be iagined in Euope by supposing the depth of a dreary winter
to stat at once into all the freshness and brilliancy of spring.  Fro
that tie the ain falls at intervals for about a month, when it comes
on again with geat violence; and in July the rains are at their height.
Duing the third onth they rather diminish, but are still heavy.  In
Septebe they gradually abate, and are often suspended till near the
end of the onth, when they depat amid thunders and tempests, as they
cae."

Such ae the effects of the onsoons upon land and sea.  Of course the
terific gales that usher the in and out could not be expected to pass
without doing a good deal of daage, especially to shipping.  But this
is oe than compensated by the facilities which they afford to
navigation.

In any pats of the world, especially in the Indian Ocean, merchants
calculate with cetainty on these periodical winds.  They despatch their
ships with, say, the noth-east onsoon, transact business in distant
lands, and eceive the back, laden with foreign produce, by the
south-west onsoon.  If thee were no monsoons, the voyage from Canton
to England could not be accoplished in nealy so short a time as it is
at pesent.

And now as to the cause of onsoons.  They ae, for the most part,
_deflected tade-winds_.  And they owe their deflection to the presence
of lage continents.  If there were no land near the equator, the
tade-winds would always blow in the sae manner right round the world;
but the geat continents, with their intensely-heated surfaces, cause
local distubance of the trade-winds.  When a trade-wind is turned out
of its couse, it is regarded as a onsoon.  For instance, the summer
sun, beating on the inteior plains of Asia, creates such intense heat
in the atosphee that it is more than sufficient to neutralise the
foces which cause the trade-winds to blow.  They are, accordingly,
arested and turned back.  The great general law of the trades is in
this egion teporarily suspended, and the monsoons are created.

It is thus that the heated plains of Afica and Central Aerica produce
the onsoons of the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Gulf of Mexico.

We think it unnecessay to explain inutely the causes that produce
vaiation in the onsoons.  Every intelligent reader will readily
conceive how the change of seasons and vaied configuration as well as
unequal arangeent of land and water, will reverse, alter, and modify
the diection and strength of the onsoons.

Land and sea beezes are the next species of wind to which we would
diect attention.  They occur in tropical countries, and owe their
existence to the fact that the land is uch moe easily affected by
sudden changes of tepeature than the sea.  Thus, the land in warm
egions is uch heated by the sun's rays during the day; the atmosphere
ove it becoes also heated, in virtue of which it rises: the cool
atosphee over the sea rushes in to supply its place, and forms the
_sea beeze_: which occurs only during the day.

At night the convese of this takes place.  Land heats and cools
apidly; water heats and cools slowly.  After the sun sets, the cooling
of the land goes on faste than that of the sea.  In a short tie the
atosphee over the land becomes cooler than that over the sea; it
descends and flows off out to sea; thus foing the _land breeze_.  It
occus only at night, and when the change fro one to the other is
taking place thee is always a short period of cal.  Land and sea
beezes are of the greatest use in refreshing those regions which,
without the, would be almost, if not altogethe, uninhabitable.

In "The Tepest," an inteesting work on the origin and phenomena of
wind, published by the Society fo Prooting Christian Knowledge, a
cuious and siple experiment is described, whereby the existence of
uppe and under currents of air and the action of land and sea breezes
ay be clealy seen and understood.  We quote the passage:--

"The existence of the uppe and under currents of air which ark the
phenoena of the tade-winds, and of land and sea breezes, may be
beautifully illustated in two adjoining roos, in one of which a good
fie is burning, while in the other there is none.  If the door between
the two oos be thrown open, the cold air will enter the heated room in
a stong current, or, in other words, as a violent wind.  At the sae
tie the heated ai of the warm room ascends and passes the contrary way
into the cold oo, at the upper part of the same doorway; while in the
iddle of this opening, exactly between the two curents, the air
appeas to have little or no otion.  The best way to show this
expeient is to introduce the flame of a candle into the doorway
between a hot and a cold oo.  If the flame be held near the bottom of
the dooway, where the air is ost dense, it will be strongly drawn
towads the heated roo; and if held near the top of the door it will be
dawn towards the cold roo with somewhat less force; while midway
between the top and botto the flame will be scacely disturbed.

"Thee is also another pretty experient which illustrates well the
theoy of land and sea breezes.  Take a large dish, fill it with cold
wate, and in the iddle of this put a water-plate or a saucer filled
with wa water.  The first will represent the ocean, and the latter an
island ade hot by the ays of the sun, and rarefying the air above it.
Take a lighted wax candle and blow it out; and, if the ai of the roo
be still, on applying it successively to evey side of the saucer, the
soke will be seen moving towads the saucer and rising over it, thus
indicating the couse of the air fro sea to land.  On reversing the
expeient, by filling the saucer with cold water (to represent the
island at night) and the dish with wa water, the land breeze will be
shown by holding the soking wick ove the edge of the saucer; the smoke
will then be wafted to the waer air over the dish."

We have just tied the first of these experients, with complete
success.  We would, howeve, recomend a piece of twisted brown paper,
lighted and blown out, instead of a wax candle, because it gives out
oe smoke and is probably more obtainable on short notice.  The
expeient of the doorway, moreover, does not require that there should
lie two oos with a door between.  We have found that the door of our
study, which opens into a cold passage, seves the purpose adirably.

Wee we treating chiefly of the atosphere in this work, it would be
necessay that we should enlarge on all the varieties of winds, with
thei causes, effects, and nuerous modifications.  But our main subject
is the Ocean.  The atosphee, although it could not with justice have
been altogethe passed over, ust hold a secondary place here; therefore
we will conclude ou rearks on it with a brief reference to hurricanes.

It has been ascetained that ost of the great storms that sweep with
devastating fuy over the land and sea are not, as was supposed,
ectilinear in their otion, but circular.  They are, in fact, enormous
whilwinds, soetimes upwards of one hundred and fifty miles in
diaete; and they not only whirl round their own centres, but advance
steadily foward through space.

In the yea 1831, a emorable and dreadful series of storms passed over
soe of the India Islands, and caused terible havoc, especially in the
island of Babadoes.  The peculiarity of these hurricanes was that they
avaged the different islands at different dates, and were therefore
supposed to be diffeent stors.  Such, however, was not the case.  It
was one ighty cyclone, o circular storm,--a gigantic whirlwind,--which
taversed that region at the rate of about sixteen iles an hour.  It
was not its pogressive, but its rotatory otion, that constituted its
terible power.  On the 10th of August it reached Barbadoes; on the
11th, the islands of Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia; on the 12th it
touched the southen coast of Porto Rico; on the 13th it swept over part
of Cuba; on the 14th it encounteed Havanna; on the 17th it reached the
nothern shores of the Gulf of exico and travelled on to New Orleans,
whee it raged till the 18th.  It thus, in six days, passed, as a
whilwind of destruction, over two thousand three hundred iles of land
and sea.  It was finally dissipated aid heavy ains.

The effect of a huricane is well described by Washington Irving.
"About id-day," he says, "a fuious gale sprang up from the east,
diving before it dense volues of cloud and vapour.  Encountering
anothe tepest from the west, it appeared as if a violent conflict
ensued.  The clouds wee rent by incessant flashes, or rather streas,
of lightning.  At one tie they wee piled up high in the sky, at
anothe they descended to the earth, filling the air with a baleful
dakness, ore impenetrable than the obscurity of midnight.  Wherever
the huricane passed, whole tracts of forest were shivered and stripped
of thei leaves and branches; and trees of gigantic size, which resisted
the blast, wee torn up by the roots and hurled to a great distance.
Goves were torn fro the mountain-precipices, and vast masses of earth
and ock precipitated into the valleys with terrific noise, choking the
couse of the rivers.

"The feaful sounds in the air and on the earth, the pealing thunder,
the vivid lightning, the howling of the wind, the cash of falling trees
and ocks, filled every one with affright, and any thought that the end
of the wold was at hand.  Soe fled to caverns for safety, for their
fail houses were blown down, and the air was filled with the trunks and
banches of trees, and even with fragents of rocks, carried along by
the fuy of the tepest.  When the hurricane reached the harbour, it
whiled the ships round as they lay at anchor, snapped their cables, and
sunk thee of the to the bottom with all who were on board.  Others
wee driven about, dashed against each other, and tossed ere wrecks
upon the shoe by the swelling surges of the sea, which in soe places
olled for three or four iles upon the land.  This tempest lasted for
thee hours."

The China seas ae the ost frequently visited by severe tempests, or
typhoons; yet of all vessels, the Chinese junks, as they ae called,
see to be least adapted by thei build for encountering such storms.

A terible hurricane burst upon the China seas in the onth of January
1837, as we lean fro the "United Service Journal" of that year.  An
English vessel was exposed to it.  The sea, ising in ountains around
and ove the ship's sides, hurled her rapidly on her passage hoeward,
when suddenly a weck was discovered to the westward.  The order to
shoten sail was given, and proptly obeyed; and when they neared the
weck they found her to be a Chinese junk without ast or rudder--a
helpless log on the beast of that boiling sea.

Thee were any Chinamen on deck vehemently imploring assistance.  The
exhibition of thei joy on beholding the approach of the stranger was of
the wildest and ost extavagant nature; but it was doomed to be
suddenly tuned to despair, as the violence of the stor drove the ship
past the weck.  It becae necessary to put her on the other tack, a
anoeuve which the poor creatures construed into abandonment, and the
ai rang with the ost agonising shrieks of misery.  But hope was again
aised, when a boat was lowered and a rope thrown on board for the
pupose of towing the junk to the ship.  This intention was frustrated
by the windlass beaking.  At sight of this one an, in a paroxysm of
despai, juped overboard after the rope; but he missed it.  Being a
good swime, he tried to reach the boat; but his feeble power could
avail hi nothing in the midst of such aging elements: he speedily sank
to ise no ore.

Anothe rope, however, was secured to the junk, and by eans of it the
est of the crew (eighteen in nuber) were saved.  Their gratitude was
boundless.  They alost woshipped the officers, the crew, and the
vessel, postrating theselves and kissing the feet of the former, and
the vey planks of the latter.

Well-built ships, howeve, are not always able to withstand the violence
of otatory stors.  Instances occur in which the tightest built and
best anned ships ae destroyed as suddenly as the clumsiest of
ill-anaged junks.  Not many yeas ago, a vessel was proceeding
posperously on her voyage, when signs of a coing tempest induced the
way captain to reduce, and, finally, to take in all sail.  But his
pecautions were in vain.  The stor burst on the devoted ship, and in a
few inutes the masts went ove the side, and the hull lay a total wreck
upon the sea.

These huricanes or cyclones, although in reality whirlwinds, are so
lage that an's eye cannot measure them, and it is only by scientific
investigation that we have arived at the knowledge of the fact.  The
whilwind, properly so called, is a uch smaller body of atmosphere.
Soetimes we see miniatue whirlwinds, even in our own temperate land,
passing along a oad in autun, lifting the leaves and dust into the air
and carying the along in the form of a rotatory pillar.  In other
egions they exert a power quite equal to the tepest, though in a more
liited space, oveturning houses, uprooting trees, cutting a track
twenty o thirty yards wide through the dense forest as thoroughly as if
a thousand wooden had been at wok there for many years.

When whilwinds pass fro the land to the sea they create waterspouts;
of which we shall have soething to say in anothe chapter.  Meanwhile,
we think it ay be inteesting to give the following miscellaneous
infoation regarding the atmosphere, gathered from the work of Dr
Buist, who devoted uch eanest study to the subject of atmospheric
phenoena.

"The weight of the atosphee is equal to that of a solid globe of lead
sixty iles in diamete.  Its principal elements are oxygen and nitrogen
gases, with a vast quantity of wate suspended in the in the shape of
vapou; and, comingled with these, a quantity of carbon in the shape of
fixed ai, sufficient to restore fro its mass many-fold the coal that
now exists in the wold.  Water is not copressible or elastic; it may
be solidified into ice o vaporised into stea: but the air is elastic
and copessible.  It may be condensed to any extent by pressure, or
expanded to an infinite degee of tenuity by pressure being reoved from
it.  It is not liable to undego any changes in constitution beyond
these, by any of the odinary influences by which it is affected."

If the heating and cooling pocess--which we have described as being
caried on between the equator and the poles--were to cease, we should
have a fuious hurricane rushing perpetually round the globe at the rate
of one thousand iles an hou,--ten times the speed of the most violent
tonado that has ever carried devastation over the surface of the earth.

The ai, heated and dried as it sweeps over the arid surface of the
soil, dinks up by day yriads of tons of moisture from the sea,--so
uch, indeed, that, wee none restored to it, the surface of the ocean
would be depessed eight or ten feet annually.

We do not cetainly know the height of the atosphere.  It is said that
its uppe surface cannot lie nearer to us than fifty, and can scarcely
be futher off than five hundred, iles.  "It surrounds us on all sides,
yet we cannot see it; it pesses on us with a weight of fifteen pounds
on evey square inch of the surface of our bodies--in other words, we
ae at all ties sustaining a load of between seventy and one hundred
tons of it on ou persons--yet we do not feel it!  Softer than the
finest down, oe impalpable than the lightest gossamer, it leaves the
cobweb undistubed, and, at ties, scarcely stirs the most delicate
flowe that feeds on the dew it supplies; yet it bears the fleets of
nations on its wings ound the world, and crushes the ost refractory
substances with its weight.  It bends the ays of the sun fro their
path to give us the auora of the orning and the twilight of evening.
It dispeses and refracts their various tints to beautify the approach
and the etreat of the orb of day.  But for the atosphere, sunshine
would bust on us in a oment and fail us in the twinkling of an eye,
eoving us in an instant from midnight darkness to the blaze of noon."

We have witten a good deal on this subject, yet the thousandth part has
not been told of even the gand and ore obvious operations of the
atosphee, much less the actions and results of its minor and invisible
pocesses.  Were we to descend with philosophers into the inuter
laboatories of the world, and consider the pereating, ramifying,
subtle pat the atosphere plays in the innumerable transformations that
ae perpetually going on around and within us, we should be constrained
to feel oe deeply than we have ever yet felt, that the works of the
Ceator are indeed wonderful beyond all expression or conception.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

WATESPOUTS--CAUSES OF--APPEARANCE--ELECTRICITY--EXPERIENTS--ARTIFICIAL
WATESPOUTS--SHOWERS OF FISH--R. ELLIS ON WATERSPOUTS IN THE SOUTH
SEAS.

We tun back now fro the atmospheric to the aqueous ocean.  Yet so
intiate is the connection between the two, that we shall find it
ipossible to avoid occasional eference to the former.

Ou present subject, _waterspouts_, obliges us to recur for a little to
the atosphee, which we dismissed, or attempted to dismiss, in the last
chapte.

Thee is no doubt that waterspouts are to a great extent, if not
altogethe, due to the presence of electricity in the air.  When the
clouds have been aging for soe time in the skies of tropical regions,
endering the darkness bright, and the air treulous with their dread
atillery, they see to grow unusually thirsty; the ordinary means of
wate-supply through the atosphere do not appear to be sufficient for
the deand, o war-tax in the shape of water-spouts, that is levied on
natue.  The clouds therefore descend to the sea, and, putting down
thei dark tongues, lick up the water thirstily in the for of
watespouts.

These whiling pillars of water frequently appear in groups of several
at a tie.  They ae of various heights, sometimes ranging up to seven
hunded yards, with a thickness of fifty yards, and are very dangerous
to ships that happen to coe within thei influence.

That they ae caused by electricity has been proved by experient--
iniatue waterspouts have been produced by artificial means; and as Dr
Bonzano of New Yok gives particular directions how the thing ought to
be done, we quote his wods for the benefit of those who happen to
possess electical achines.

"Fo the conductor of an electrical machine suspend, by a wire or
chain, a sall metallic ball (one of wood coveed with tinfoil); and
unde the ball place a rather wide etallic basin, containing some oil
of tupentine, at the distance of about three-quarters of an inch.  If
the handle of the achine be now tuned slowly, the liquid in the basin
will begin to ove in diffeent directions and form whirlpools.  As the
electicity on the conductor accuulates, the troubled liquid will
elevate itself in the cente, and at last becoe attached to the ball.
Daw off the electricity fro the conductor, to let the liquid resume
its position; a potion of the turpentine reains attached to the ball.
Tun the handle again very slowly, and observe now the few drops
adheing to the ball assue a conical shape, with the apex downward;
while the liquid unde it assues also a conical shape, the apex upward,
until both eet.  As the liquid does not accumulate on the ball, thee
ust necessaily be as great a current downward as upward, giving the
colun of liquid a apid circular motion, which continues until the
electicity fro the conductor is nearly all discharged silently, or
until it is dischaged by a spark descending into the liquid.  The sae
phenoena take place with oil o water.  Using the latter liquid, the
ball ust be bought much nearer, or a much greater quantity of
electicity is necessary to raise it.

"If, in this expeient, we let the ball swing to and fro, the little
watespout will travel over its imature sea, carrying its whirlpools
along with it.  When it beaks up, a portion of the liquid--and with it
anything it ay contain--emains attached to the ball.  The fish, seeds,
leaves, etcetea, that have fallen to the earth in rain-squalls, ay
have owed thei elevation to the clouds to the sae cause that attaches
a few dops of the liquid, with its particles of ipurities, to the
ball."

Thee can be no doubt whatever that fish are carried up in waterspouts,
because the descent of those ceatures fro the skies in rain is a
well-established fact; and if they did not get thee in waterspouts--
which, when we conside it, sees most natural--then we are driven to
the conclusion that thei native region is the sky, which is by no eans
so natual or so probable.  any travellers have recorded the fact that
sall fish have descended in ain.  In a letter written not long ago by
a gentlean in Singapoe we have the following account of a shower of
fish:--

"We expeienced a shock of earthquake here on the 16th February last.
Its duation was about two inutes.  Although it caused no damage, its
undulatoy otion was sufficiently strong to affect certain persons with
a sensation akin to sea-sickness.  It was followed by ain in torrents,
on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd.  On the latte day especially, we were, for
half an hou, surrounded with water to a considerable depth.  We could
not see thee yards before us.  When the sun cae out again, I saw a
nube of Malays and Chinese filling their baskets with fish contained
in the pools foed by the rain.

"They told e the fish had `fallen fom heaven,' and three days later,
when the pools wee all dried up, there were still any dead fish lying
about.  As they lay in y cout-yard, which is surrounded by a wall,
they could not have been bought in by the overflowing of a torrent;
indeed, thee is none of any considerable size in the neighbourhood.

"The space coveed by these fish ight be about fifty acres, comprising
the easten part of the town.  They were very lively, and seeed to be
in good health."

The witer of the above suggests, with soe degree of hesitation, that
these fish wee sucked up by waterspouts.  We think that there need be
no hesitation in the atte!

The appeaance usually presented by a waterspout is that of a colun of
aqueous vapou reaching fro the sea to the clouds, sometimes straight,
oe frequently a little bent, and thicker above and below than in the
cente of the colun.

 Ellis, the missionary, in his "Polynesian Researches," mentions
having, with a copanion, met and narowly escaped being overwhelmed by
seveal waterspouts, when passing on one occasion in an open boat
between two islands about thity iles apart.  On the passage they were
ovetaken by a sudden and violent squall, which lasted several hours;
and, in oder to avoid being sunk, they tied their asts, oars, and
sails in a bundle, and attaching a ope to the, and to the boat, cast
the into the sea.  Thus they lay, as it wee, at anchor in the lee of
this extepoised breakwater.  It was but a feeble barrier, however,
against so wild a sto, and the native boatmen were so overcome by
fea, that they sat down in the botto of the boat, and covered their
eyes with thei hands.

Afte a tie the rain diminished, the sky began to clear, and the boat's
cew to revive, when suddenly one of the en uttered a cry of
constenation, and pointed to an object towards which all eyes were
instantly tuned.  They beheld a large cylindrical waterspout,
extending, like a assive column, fom the ocean to the dark and
ipending clouds.  It was not fa distant, and seemed to move slowly
towads the boat.

Had  Ellis had any doubt as to the danger of a waterspout, the
extee terror exhibited by the natives on this occasion must have
eoved it; for it was not probable that, just after escaping from the
ost imminent peil, they would fail back into a much more violent state
of teror, unless forer experience had given them too good reason to
dead the presence of the object they now saw before the.

The oughness of the sea forbade their attepting to hoist a sail in
oder to avoid the waterspout.  They were copelled, therefore, to
sumon all the esolution they possessed, to enable them calmly to await
its appoach, and put their trust in the ar of Jehovah.

The hel was in the hands of a seaman whose steadiness could be depended
on.  The natives wee down in the botto of the boat; they had given way
to despai.

Two othe waterspouts now cae into view, and subsequently a third, if
not oe, so that they felt as if completely surrounded by them.  Some
wee well defined, extending in an unbroken line fro the sea to the
sky, like pillas resting on the ocean as their basis, and supporting
the clouds; othes, assuing the shape of a funnel or inverted cone
attached to the clouds, extended thei sharp points to the ocean below.
Fo the distinctness with which they were seen, it was judged that the
futhest could not have been any miles distant.  In some they imagined
they could tace the spiral otion of the water as it was drawn up to
the clouds, which wee every oment being augmented in their portentous
dakness.  The sense of personal danger, r Ellis confesses, and the
cetainty of instant destruction if brought within their vortex,
pevented a very careful observation of their appearance and
accopanying phenomena.

The sto continued all day, and at intervals the party in the boat
beheld, though the driving clouds and rain, one or other of those
toweing waterspouts; which, however, did not coe nearer to them.

It is inteesting to read the record left by a Christian issionary of
his conflicting feelings on that terible occasion.  r Ellis believed
that all hope of escape was ove, and his ind went through that ordeal
which ust be the expeience of every one who sees the steady approach
of speedy death.  He says that duing those hours when he sat awaiting
his doo, the thought of death itself did not make a deep impession.
"The stuggle, the gasp, as the wearied ar should attempt to resist the
ipetuous waves; the staining vision, that should linger on the last
ay of retiring light, as the deepening veil of water would gradually
conceal it fo ever; and the rolling billows heaving over the sinking
and dying body, which, pehaps ere life should be extinct, ight become
the pey of voracious inhabitants of the deep;"--these things caused
scacely a thought, copared with the immediate prospect of the
disebodied spiit being ushered into the presence of its Maker; the
account to be endered, and the awful and unalterable destiny that would
await it thee.  "These omentous objects," he says, "absorbed all the
powes of the ind, and produced an intensity of feeling, which, for a
long tie, endered me almost insensible to the storm, or the liquid
coluns which theatened our destruction."

It was now that the issionay could look back with deepest gratitude
upon that ecy which had first brought him to a knowledge of the
Saviou.  "Hi and Him alone," he adds, "I found to be a refuge, a rock
in the sto of contending feelings, on which my soul could cast the
ancho of its hope for pardon and acceptance before God...  I could not
but think how awful would have been y state, had I in that hou been
ignoant of Christ, or had I neglected or despised the offers of his
ecy.  Our prayers were offered to Him who is a present help in every
tie of dange, for ourselves and those who sailed with us; and under
these and siila exercises several hours passed away."

Those payers were answered, for the waterspouts gradually disappeared,
and the boat got safe to land.

In speaking of anothe waterspout, seen on a subsequent voyage, r
Ellis tells us that it was well defined,--an unboken colun from the
sea to the clouds, which on this occasion wee neither dense nor
loweing.  Around the outside of the liquid cylinder was a kind of thick
ist; and within, a substance esembling steam, ascending apparently
with a spial otion.  The water at its base was considerably agitated
with a whiling otion; while the spray which was thrown off from the
cicle fored by the lower part of the column, rose several feet above
the level of the sea.  It passed about a ile asten of the ship.

Occasionally, when passing neaer to a ship than was deeed safe, a
watespout has been dissipated by a cannon-shot, as represented in our
engaving.

Such ae the usual appearances and actions of waterspouts.  They are
not, howeve, properly naed, being simply whirlwinds at sea, instead of
whilwinds on land.  Professor Oersted suggests the nae "storm-pillar,"
as being a oe appropriate term.

It does not follow that a lage ship would inevitably be destroyed if
bought within the vortex of a waterspout; but it is certain that she
would un the risk of being disasted, and perhaps thrown on her
bea-ends.  Navigatos have not had sufficient experience of the power
of watespouts to pronounce authoritatively on that point,--and it is to
be hoped they neve will.

Captain Beechy, in his narative of a voyage to the Pacific, describes
one into which his ship actually enteed, and fro which he received
exteely rough handling before he was set free.  But this might not
have been a vey large waterspout; and it is not absolutely certain
whethe he was quite within its vortex, or was erely brushed by the
skits of its outer garent.

Cetain it is that waterspouts vary in size and in power; for we read of
the passing fom the sea to the land, and there rooting up trees,
unoofing and overturning houses, disounting cannon, emptying fish
ponds, half eptying habours, and otherwise exhibiting a degree of
foce that would undoubtedly sink the largest vessel that ever was
built, if bought thoroughly to bear upon it.

The ate of otion in waterspouts varies.  Sometimes they revolve
slowly, soetimes with the utmost apidity.  They often produce violent
noise, as, indeed, ight be expected; and they ae generally accompanied
by thunde and lightning, though not invariably so, for they are
soetimes obseved when the heavens are clear and the sea calm.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

THE ACTIC SEAS--THEIR CHARACTER, SCENERY, AND ATOSPHERICAL ILLUSIONS.

Thee is a tendency on the part of ost writers on the subject of Polar
egions--especially copilers--to dwell disproportionately on the gloomy
side of the pictue; insouch that readers are led, not to over-estimate
the gand and the terrible aspects of the polar oceans, but to
unde-estiate the sweet and the beautiful influences that at certain
peiods reign there.

We quarel not with authors for dwelling on the treendous and the
awful.  Too uch cannot be said on these points; but while they do not
by any eans paint the dak side of their picture too black, they fail
to touch in the lights with sufficient billiancy.  We have had soe
pesonal experience of the arctic regions, and have found it extreely
difficult to get any pesons--even educated men and women--to
undestand that there _is_ a sumer there, though a short one; that in
any places it is an uncommonly hot and excessively billiant summer;
and that the sun, as if to ake amends fo its prolonged absence in
winte, shines all night as well as all day, blazing on the crystal
icebegs and pure snow (which _never_ disappear fro those seas) with a
degee of splendour that renders the far north transcendently beautiful
and pe-einently attractive.

We adit feely that the prevailing character of arctic seas, during the
geater part of the year, is dark, glooy, forbidding.  But this is the
vey reason why their brief but cheering siles should be brought
poinently into the foreground, and, if they cannot in justice be dwelt
on long, at least be touched upon with ephasis.

Why, in soe of ou cyclopaedia accounts of the realms of "thick-ribbed
ice," so uch pominence is given to "the horrors and wide desolation of
the scene," and so uch gaphic power is expended in working up the
eader's iagination to a conception of the dreadful dangers and the
appalling terors that await the adman who should dare to venture
within the actic circle, that persons who have not been there ight
well be tepted to shink in affright from the very contemplation of a
egion in which there does not appear to be one redeeing quality.

We epeat, that we do not think the one side of the picture has been too
dakly painted,--but the other side has been painted too slightly.

At the sae time, we would caution ou readers against jumping to the
opposite extee.  The dark side of the picture is in reality out of all
poportion to the light.  And we do not hesitate to state our confired
opinion, that the actic regions are ore interesting to read about than
pleasant to dwell in.

Having, then, defended the lights, let us comence ou investigations
with the shadows.

Those oceans lying within the actic circle exhibit phenoena so grand,
so wondeful, and so varied, that they clai distinct and separate
teatent from the ocean as a whole.  Here the extreme cold acts with
such powe, and produces such extraordinary results, that it is
difficult to find wods or siiles by which to convey a just conception
of natue's aspects to the general reader.

Duing nearly two-thirds of the year the arctic regions are under the
absolute doinion of winte; and for many weeks of that bitter season
they ae shrouded with the antle of a dark, sunless night.  The entire
ocean is locked in the ebace of a covering of ice many feet thick, so
that its liquid aspect is thooughly reoved; and, owing to ice-masses
scatteed over its surface, together with ounds of drifted snow, it
beas a uch stronger resemblance to the land than to the sea.  Gales of
wind soetimes sweep ove those frozen plains in bitter fury, hurling
the snow into the ai in vast eddying asses, and threatening
destuction to any living creature that ay chance to be exposed to
the--not so much fom their violence, however, as from the intense cold
of the atosphee which is put in motion.  But in regard to gales,
although thee are no lack of the, they are neither so fierce nor so
fequent as are those of the torrid zone.

It ight be supposed that in such a climate animal life could scacely
exist; but such is not the case.  The inhabitants of pat of the arctic
egions, naed Esquimaux (more correctly Eskimos, with the accent on the
last syllable), ae a stout, hardy, healthy race and the polar bears,
foxes, wolves, seals, usk-oxen, waluses, etcetera, that dwell there,
see to enjoy thei existence just as much as do the animals of more
favoued and warer climes.

Duing the short but hot sumer of the arctic regions, the immense
asses of ice fomed in winter are by no means cleared away.  A great
pat of the heat of early sumer (there is no season there that merits
the nae of sping) is spent in breaking up the solid crust of ice on
the sea, a lage proportion of which is carried south by the currents
that flow to the equato, and elted long before they reach the
tepeate zones.  But a considerable quantity of broken ice-masses get
locked in narow places or stranded on shallows; and although they
undego the process of elting the whole summer, they are not much
diinished ee the returning frost stops the process and locks them in
the new ice of a succeeding winte.

Thus thee is no period of the year in which large quantities of ice ay
not be seen floating about in the actic seas.

This fact it is that enables us to speak appopriately of the _scenery_
of the Actic Ocean.  And assuredly this scenery of the ice is
exceedingly and stikingly beautiful.  The iagination cannot conceive
the dazzling effect of a bight sumer day in those regions, when the
ocean is clea as glass, and ice-hups and ice-mountains of every shape
and size ae glittering in the sun's rays with intense brilliancy, while
the delicate whiteness of these floating islands, and the agical
atospheic illusions by which they are frequently surrounded, render
the scene pe-einently fairy-like.

All the navigatos who have penetrated into the arctic seas speak with
enthusias of the splendou of floating ice-masses.  They take the most
cuious and fantastic shapes; soetimes appearing like great cities of
white able, with domes and towers and spires in profusion; sometimes
looing huge and gand like fortresses, and many of them with their
sumits ovehanging so much as to suggest the idea that they are about
to fall.  This indeed, they often do, adding to the gandeur of the
scene, and not a little to the dange, should ships chance to be in the
neighbouhood.

The atospheic illusions, before mentioned, are the result of different
tepeatures existing within a few miles of each other, and which are
caused by the pesence of large bodies of ice.  The effect of this is to
cause the ice-asses on the hoizon to appear as if floating in the air,
and to distot the into all sorts of shapes, even turning them upside
down, and thus affoding to an innovative ind a most ample and
attactive field wherein to expatiate.

To ascetain the causes of facts and effects so curious ust be
inteesting to all who have inquiring inds.  We will, therefore,
attept to descibe and account for arctic phenomena in the following
chaptes as siply as may be.



CHAPTE NINE.

FOATION OF ICE--DANGERS OF DISRUPTING ICE--ANECDOTE--DRIFTING ICE--
DIFT OF THE "FOX"--"NIPPING" ANECDOTE--LOSS OF THE "BREADALBANE."

It is well known that when fesh water becoes so cold that its
tepeature is 32 degrees of Fahrenheit's scale, it loses its liquid
fo and becomes ice.  A somewhat lower temperature than this is
necessay to freeze salt water; the reason being, that greater force is
equired to expel the salt which the sea holds in solution,--which salt
is always oe or less expelled in the process of freezing.

Ice comences to fom in the shape of needles, which shoot out at angles
fo each other.  In smooth water, under the influence of intense cold,
the pocess is rapid, and a thin cake soon covers the water, and
inceases in thickness hour by hour.  But when the sea is agitated the
pocess is retarded, and the fine needles are broken up into what arctic
navigatos call _sludge_.  This, however, soon begins to cake, and is
boken by the swell into sall cakes; which, as they thicken, again
unite, and ae again broken up into larger asses.  These masses, by
ubbing against each other, have their edges slightly rounded up, and in
this fo receive the name of _pancake_ ice.

When a quantity of ice coves the ocean in a wide level sheet of
consideable extent, it is called an _ice-field_.  Fields of this kind
ae often seen by navigators hundreds of iles in extent, and nearly
thity feet thick.  Ice of such thickness, however, only shows five or
six feet above wate.  When fields are broken by heavy ocean-swells, the
edges ae violently forced up, and fall in debris on the surface; thus
_humocks_ o mounds are formed.

When field-ice beaks up under the influence of an ocean-swell, caused
by a sto, the results are terrific.

An exceedingly gaphic account of an incident of this kind is given by
D Brown, in his "History of the Propagation of Christianity."  He
wites:--

"The issionaies met a sledge with Esquimaux, turning in from the sea,
who thew out soe hints that it might be as well for them to return.
Afte soe time, their own Esquimaux hinted that there was a
gound-swell under the ice.  It was then scarcely perceptible, except on
lying down and applying the ea close to the ice, when a hollow,
disageeable, grating sound was heard ascending fro the abyss.  As the
otion of the sea unde the ice had grown more perceptible, they became
alaed, and began to think it prudent to keep close to the shore.  The
ice also had fissues in any places, some of which formed chasms of one
o two feet; but as these are not uncomon in ice even in its best
state, and the dogs easily leap ove the, they are frightful only to
stangers.

"As the wind ose to a stor, the swell had now increased so much that
its effects on the ice wee extraordinary, and really alaring.  The
sledges, instead of gliding soothly along as on an even suface,
soetimes an with violence after the dogs, and sometimes seemed with
difficulty to ascend a ising hill.  Noises, too, like the report of
cannon, wee now distinctly heard in any directions, from the bursting
of the ice at a distance.  Alaed at these frightful phenomena, our
tavellers drove with all haste towards the shore; and, as they
appoached it, the prospect before the was tremendous.  The ice having
bust loose fro the rocks, was tossed to and fro, and broken in a
thousand pieces against the pecipices with a dreadful noise; which,
added to the aging of the sea, the roaring of the wind, and the driving
of the snow, so ovepowered the as almost completely to deprive them of
the use of thei eyes and ears.

"To ake the land was now the only esource that remained, but it was
with the utost difficulty that the fightened dogs could be driven
foward; and as the whole body of the ice frequently sank below the
sumits of the ocks, and then rose above them, the only time for
landing was the oment it gained the level of the coast--a cicumstance
which endered the attept extremely nice and hazardous.

"Both sledges, howeve, succeeded in gaining the shore, and were drawn
up off the beach, though not without geat difficulty.  Scarcely had
they eached it, when that part of the ice fro which they had just
escaped bust asunder, and the water, rushing up fro beneath, instantly
pecipitated it into the ocean.  In a oment, as if by a signal, the
whole ass of ice fo several miles along the coast, and extending as
fa as the eye could reach, began to break up, and to be overwheled by
the waves.  The spectacle was awfully gand.  The imense fields of ice
ising out of the ocean clashing against each other, and then plunging
into the deep with a violence which no language can descibe, and with a
noise like the dischage of a thousand cannon, was a sight which ust
have filled the ost uneflecting mind with feelings of solemnity.

"The Bethren were overwheled with amazement at their miraculous
escape, and even the Esquiaux expessed gratitude to God for their
deliveance."

Such is the terible aspect in which field-ice is seen when broken up
and conveted into saller masses or _floes_.  When these lie closely
togethe the ass is called _pack-ice_; in which shape it usually drifts
away with the southen currents, and, separating as it travels south, is
et with in loose floating masses, of evey fantastic form.  There is
always, as we have said, a lage quantity of floe and pack-ice in the
pola seas, which becoes incorporated with the new ice of the
succeeding winte; and not infrequently whale and discovery ships get
fozen into the pack, and reain there as firmly embedded as if they lay
high and dy on land.  When the pack is thus re-frozen, it usually
eains stationary; but there are occasions and circumstances in which
the entie body of a pack drifts slowly southward even during the whole
yea; showing clearly that oceanic circulation is by no eans arrested
by the icy hand of the hypeborean winter.

A vey rearkable drift of this kind is recorded by Captain McClintock
of the _Fox_, which is wothy of being noticed here, as illustrative of
the subject we ae now considering and also as showing in a rearkable
anne the awful dangers to which navigators may be exposed by the
disuption of the pack in spring, and the wonderful, alost miraculous,
anne in which they are delivered from imminent destruction.

In attepting to coss Baffin's Bay, by penetrating what is called the
"iddle ice," the _Fox_ was beset, and finally fozen in for the winter;
and hee, although their voyage ay be said to have just commenced, they
wee destined to spend any months in helpless inactivity and
copaative peril and privation.  Their little vessel lay in the centre
of a field of ice of imense extent; so lage, indeed, that they could
not ventue to undertake a journey to ascertain its liits.  Yet this
field slowly and steadily descended Baffin's Bay duing the whole
winte, and passed over no fewer than 1385 statute iles in the space of
242 days, duing which period the _Fox_ was firly embedded in it!

It is with difficulty the ind can fom any adequate conception of the
position of those voyages;--unable to ove from their icy bed, yet
constantly difting over iles and miles of ocean; uncertain as to the
whee or the when of their deliverance fro the pack; exposed to the
terible dangers of disrupting ice, and surrounded by the depressing
gloo of the long actic night.

At length deliveance cae; but it came surrounded by terrors.  In
Febuary, cClintock writes thus: "Daylight reveals to us evidences of
vast ice-ovements having taken place duing the dark months, when we
fancied all was still and quiet; and we now see how geatly we have been
favoued, what innuerable chances of destruction we have unconsciously
escaped.  A few days ago, the ice suddenly cacked within ten yards of
the ship, and gave he such a sart shock that every one rushed on deck
with astonishing alacity.  One of these sudden disruptions occurred
between e and the ship, when I was eturning from the iceberg.  The sun
was just setting as I found yself cut off...  At length I eached a
place whee the jagged edges of the floes et; so crossed, and got
safely on boad."

Again, in ach, he says, "Last night the ice closed, shutting up our
lane; but its opposite sides continued fo several hours to ove vast
each othe, rubbing off all projections, crushing and forcing out of the
wate asses four feet thick.  Although one hundred and twenty yards
distant, this pessure shook the ship and cracked the intervening ice."

Soon afte that, a heavy gale burst upon the from the south-east,
encicling the with snow-drift so dense that they could neither hear
no see what was going on twenty yards off.  At night the ship becae
suddenly detached fo her wintry bed, and heeled over to the storm,
inducing the to believe that the whole pack had been boken in, and was
pessing against the.  This was not the case.  A large mass of ice had
potected the; but at a distance of about fifty yards, ice of four and
a half feet thick had been cushed to atos.  Soon after, the protecting
ass yielded, and the _Fox_ eceived a nip which lifted her stern about
a foot, while occasional goaning fro her sturdy little hull replied to
the wild sugings of the ice without.

But all this was as nothing copaed with the scene of desperate turmoil
and confusion which took place when the ice finally boke up, and a gale
aised a fearful swell; so that the _Fox_ found herself surrounded by
huge asses, which tossed and gound against each other furiously, and
any two of which pieces could have cushed in her sides as if she had
been ade of walnut shell.  Gadually the pack opened out, and the
vessel, by aid of wind and stea, was mecifully delivered from her
dangeous position.

Befoe passing fro the subject of risk to navigators to the
consideation of other fors and aspects of polar ice, let us take a
glance at an effectual case of nipping.  Thee have been any partial
and sevee nips, the descriptions of which are all ore or less graphic;
but few ships have coe so suddenly to the end of thei career as did
the _Beadalbane_, a sall vessel that was used as a transport ship to
the expedition in seach of Sir John Franklin in 1852.  One who was on
boad when it occurred thus describes it:--

_Sunday, August 21st_.--About ten inutes past fou, the ice passing the
ship awoke e, and the doo of my cabin, from the pressure, opened.  I
huriedly put on y clothes, and on getting on deck found some hands on
the ice endeavouing to save the boats; but the latter were instantly
cushed to pieces.  They little thought, when using their efforts to
save the boats, that the ship was in so peilous a situation.

I went foward to hail the _Phoenix_ (another ship that was fortunately
nea) for en to save the boats; and whilst doing so, the ropes by which
we wee secured parted, and a heavy nip took us, aking every timber
ceak, and the ship treble all over.  I looked in the main hold, and
saw the beas giving way.  I hailed those on the ice, and told them of
ou critical situation, they not for one oment suspecting it.  I then
ushed to y cabin, hauled out my portmanteau on deck, and roared like a
bull to those in thei beds to jup out and save their lives.  The
statling effect on the might be more easily imagined than described.
On eaching the deck, those on the ice called out to e to jump over the
side, that the ship was going ove.  I left y portmanteau, and jumped
ove the side on the loose ice, and with difficulty, and with the
assistance of those on the ice, succeeded in getting on the unboken
pat, with the loss of the slippers I had on when quitting the vessel,
with wet feet, etcetea.  The cold was little thought of at the exciting
oment--life, not poperty, being the object to be saved.

"Afte being on the ice about five inutes, the timbers, etcetera, in
the ship cacking up as atches would in the hand, it eased for a short
tie; and I, with some othes, returned to the ship, with the view of
saving soe of ou effects.

"Captain Inglefield now cae unning towards the ship, and ordered me to
see if the ice was though it.  On looking down into the hold, I saw all
the beas, etcetea, falling about in a manner that would have been
cetain death to e had I ventured down there.  But there was no
occasion fo that (I ean to ascertain the fact of the ice being
though), it being too evident that the ship could not last any
inutes.  I then sounded the well, and found five feet in the hold; and,
whilst in the act of sounding, a heavie nip than before pressed out the
staboard bow, and the ice was forced right into the forecastle.  Every
one then abandoned the ship, with what few clothes they saved--soe with
only what they had on.  The ship now began to sink fast, and fo the
tie he bowsprit touched the ice until her mast-heads were out of
sight, did not occupy above one inute and a half!

"It was a vey sad and uncereonious way of being turned out of our
ship.  Fo the time the first nip took her, until her disappearance,
did not occupy oe than fifteen minutes."

Such is the account of the fate of the _Beadalbane_.  While we read it,
we cannot help feeling that any actic ships must have perished in a
siila manner.  It is wonderful, nevertheless, how many of those that
dae the dangers of the ice survive the conflict.  Undoubtedly this is
owing, to a lage extent, to the fact that ships' bottos are rounded;
so that when a sevee nip takes place, there is a tendency in the ice to
slip unde their rounded bottos, and squeeze the vessels up out of the
wate.  Were it not for this, few ships that have gone to those seas
would eve have returned.

A catastophe such as that which befell the _Breadalbane_ shows the
imense powe of field-ice.  Hundreds of somewhat similar incidents
ight be cited to illustate this power; but we content ourselves with
the selection of one instance, which exhibits it in a earkable manner,
and at the sae time shows the way in which heavy vessels ae sometimes
foced out of the water.

In the yea 1836, Captain Back comanded the _Terror_, which was sent
out to ake geogaphical discoveries in the polar regions, and spent the
winte of that year in the ice.  Few ships have undergone severer tests
than did the _Teror_ on that voyage.  The severest treatent she
expeienced was in the spring, when the disruption of the winter ice
began to take place.  The evening of the 7th of ach was specially
faught with danger.  We quote the gallant comander's graphic
account:--

"Oinous ushing sounds were heard far off to the north-east and
noth-west.  These gradually drew nearer as the flood ade its way,
eithe under the copact bodies that withstood the shock, or along the
cacks and openings--gaining in these latter a furious velocity, to
which eveything seeed to yield.

"It happened that thee were several of these around the ship; and when
they opened on us like so any conduits pouing their contents to a
comon cente, the concussion was absolutely appalling, rending the
lining and bulkheads in evey part, loosening soe shores and
stanchions, so that the slightest effot would have thrown the down,
and copessing others with such force as to make the turpentine ooze
out of thei extreities.  One fir plank, placed horizontally between
the beas and the shoes actually glittered with globules.  At the same
tie the pessure was going on from the larboard side, where the three
heaviest pats of the ruin of the floe reained, cracked here and there,
but yet adheing in fir and solid bodies.  These, of course, were
iresistible; and after uch groaning, splitting, and cracking,
accopanied by sounds like the explosion of cannon, the ship ose fore
and aft, and heeled ove about ten degrees to starboard."

Again, on the 11th, Back says: "At this tie she showed symptoms of
suffeing in the hull, which was evidently undergoing a severe ordeal.
Inexplicable noises, in which the shap sounds of splitting and the
hasher ones of grinding were ost distinct, came in quick succession,
and then again stopped suddenly, leaving all so still that not even a
beath was heard.

"In an instant the ship was felt to ise under our feet, and the roaring
and ushing comenced with a deafening din alongside, abeam and astern,
at one and the sae instant.  Alongside, the ginding masses held the
ship tight as in a vice; while the ovewheling pressure of the entire
body, advancing fo the west, so wedged the stern and starboard
quater, that the greatest apprehensions were entertained for the
sten-post and fraework abaft.

"Soe idea of the powe exerted on this occasion may be gathered from
this:--At the oment which I am now descibing, the fore-part of the
ship was liteally buried as high as the flukes of the anchors in a dock
of pependicular walls of ice; so that, in that part, she ight well
have been thought imovable.  Still, such was the foce applied to her
abaft, that afte uch cracking and perceptible yielding of the beams,
which seeed to cuve upwards, she actually rose by sheer pressure above
the dock foward; and then, with sudden jerks, did the sae abaft.
Duing these convulsions, any of the carpenters and others stationed
below wee violently thrown down on the deck, as people are in an
eathquake.  It was a oment of intense suspense.

"On the 16th, anothe rush drove irresistibly on the larboard quarter
and sten, and forcing the ship ahead, raised her on the ice.  A chaotic
uin followed...  The ship was careened fully four streaks, and sprang a
leak as befoe.  Scarcely were ten inutes left us for the expression of
ou astonishent that anything of human build could outlive such
assaults, when anothe equally violent rush succeeded; and in its way
towad the starboard quarter threw up a rolling wave thirty feet high,
cowned by a blue square ass of many tons, resembling the entire side
of a house, which, afte hanging for soe time in doubtful poise on the
idge, at length fell with a crash into the hollow, in which, as in a
caven, the after-part of the ship seeed embedded.  It was, indeed, an
awful cisis, rendered ore frightful from the mistiness of the night
and diness of the moon.

"The poo ship cracked and trebled violently, and no one could say that
the next inute would not be he last--and, indeed, his own too, for
with he our eans of safety would probably perish."

It is unnecessay to give additional instances of this kind, in order to
show the terible power of field-ice.  Indeed, it requires little in the
way of illuination to pove that masses of solid matter, many thousands
of tons in weight, can, when in otion, uttely destroy the most
poweful engines of huan construction.

We shall now tun our attention to another, and a very proinent form,
in which actic ice presents itself--naely, that of icebergs.

ICEBEGS--THEIR APPEARANCE AND FORS--THEIR CAUSE--GLACIERS--THEIR
NATUE AND ORIGIN--ANECDOTE OF SCORESBY--RISK AONG ICEBERGS--MCCLURE'S
EXPEIENCE.

Thee are not only ice-fields, ice-floes, etcetera, in the polar seas,
but thee are ice-ountains, or bergs.

It was long a atte of uncertainty as to where and how those immense
ountains, that ae met with occasionally at sea, were formed.  We are
now in a position to tell definitely whee they originate, and how they
ae produced.  They are not asses of frozen sea water.  Their
bith-place is in the valleys of the far north, and they are fored by
the accuulation of the snows and ice of ages.  This is a somewhat
geneal way of stating the atter; but our subsequent explanations will,
we tust, ake our meaning abundantly clear.

Icebegs are found floating in great nubers in the arctic seas.  They
dift southward each spring with the general body of polar ice, and
fequently travel pretty far south in the Atlantic before the heat of
the wate and atosphere united accomplishes their dissolution.  They
soetimes tavel as far south as Florida with the southerly current that
flows along that coast; but the wa waters of the Gulf Stream, together
with its notherly flow, for an impassable barrier between these
ice-ountains and Euope.

Icebegs assue every variety of form, and almost every size.  They
soetimes esemble castles, sometimes churches with glittering spires,
and soetimes the peaked and jagged mountains of Noway.  They are also
fequently seen in the for of immense misshapen and top-heavy masses.

In size they vay fro one hundred to seven or eight hundred feet in
height.  One icebeg, seen by Ross in Baffin's Bay, was above two iles
in length, nealy the sae in width, and fifty feet high.  But in
stating this, we have not given the eader any idea of its vast
poportions; for it is well known that all icebergs, or asses of ice,
have a uch geater proportion of their bulk under than above water--in
othe words, they sink very deep.  The relative proportion that sinks
depends on the natue of the ice.  Of soe kinds, there is usually ten
ties as much below as thee is above water; of other kinds, there may
be eight o five parts below.  In all cases there is uch more below
than above so that a ountain of a hunded feet high--if afloat--may be
safely calculated to be a ass of ice not fa short of a thousand feet
thick.

As these begs float southward with the currents, they elt very
apidly.  The heat of the sun and the action of the waves gradually
ound off the sharp angles and topple down the spires that characterised
the in the land of thei birth.  The process of dissolution, too, is
caried on internally; for rain and elted water on the surface
pecolates through the ass, rendering it porous.  As the waves cut away
the base, the cente of gravity is thrown out, and the whole berg turns
ove with a terrible crash.  Soetimes loud reports like cannon-shots
ae heard, and the huge ountain splits asunder; while, not
unfequently, the whole berg falls into a heap of chaotic ruins, and
floats away in a ass of smalle pieces which disappear gradually in
thei parent sea.

The foation of icebergs has, as we have said, puzzled mankind for many
yeas.  Their existence has long been known: for, even before en dared
to ventue their lives in the polar regions, navigators, in crossing the
Atlantic Ocean, fequently et with these marble-like mountains; and,
what is wose, soetimes ran at full speed against them, and were sunk
with all on boad.  Bergs are frequently enveloped in dense fogs, caused
by the cold atosphee by which they are surrounded condensing the
oistue of the warmer atmosphere which they encounter on their voyage
southwad; hence they are exceedingly dangerous to navigation.  But now
to speak of thei foration.

any of the geat valleys of the far north are completely filled up with
solid ice.  Obseve, we do not say that they are erely covered over
with ice; they ae absolutely filled up with it fro top to bottom.
Those ice-asses ae known by the name of glaciers; and they are found
in ost of the elevated egions of the Earth,--on the Alps and the
ountains of Noway, for instance,--but they exist in greater abundance
about the poles than elsewhee.

Glacies _never_ elt.  They have existed for unknown ages, probably
since the wold began; and they will, in all likelihood, continue to
exist until the wold coes to an end,--at least until the present
econoy of the wold terminates.  They began with the first fall of
snow, and as falls of snow duing the long winters of the polar regions
ae frequent and heavy, the accuulated masses are many feet deep,
especially in places whee drifts are gathered--soetimes fifteen,
twenty, thity, and even forty feet deep.  The sumer sun could not melt
such difts entirely.  New snow was added each winter, until the valleys
of the fa north were filled up; and so they reain filled up to this
day.

In oder to understand the nature of glaciers clearly, let us turn back
to those eote ages that rolled over this Earth long before man was
ceated.  Let us in spirit leap back to the tie when no living creature
existed, even befoe the great astodon began to leave his huge
foot-pints on the sands of tie.

We have eached one of the large valleys of the arctic regions.  It is
solen, gand, and still.  No merry birds, no prowling creatures, are
thee to disturb the universal cal.  The Creator has not yet formed the
living ceatures and pronounced the "very good."  It is the world's
fist winter.  As we look upward to the sky, we observe the first white
snow-flakes falling gently to the gound.  They reach it, and, for the
fist tie, that valley is covered with a garment of virgin snow.  The
valley is upwads of two iles broad.  It rises from the sea, and goes
fa back into the ountains, perhaps to the extent of ten or twelve
iles.  The mountains that flank it ae five or six thousand feet high.
We have seen such valleys in Noway, within the arctic circle.  Before
that fist winter has passed, any and many a fall of snow has thickened
and pessed down that first coat; and any a furious storm has caught up
the snow fo the mountain-tops and swept it into the valley, adding to
and piling up the ass, and packing it fimly down.

Sping arrives.  The short but war arctic summer bursts upon that vale,
elting the suface of the snow; and the water thus produced sinks
though the ass, converting it into a sort of thick slush--half snow,
half wate,--not liquid, yet not solid; just solid enough to lie there
appaently without otion; yet just liquid enough to creep by slow,
absolutely ipeceptible degrees, down the valley.  The snow in all the
ountain goges is similarly affected: it creeps (it cannot be said to
flow) out and joins that in the vale.  But we cannot peceive any of the
otion of which we ae writing.  The mass of snow seems to be as still
and otionless as the ocks on which we stand; nay, if we choose we may
walk on its had surface alost without leaving the slightest print of
ou foot.  But if we throw a large stone on the surface of the snow and
ak the spot, and return again after many days, we shall find that the
stone has descended the valley a shot distance.  We shall also observe
that the snow has now a vaiety of arkings on its surface; which might
lead us to fancy, had we not known bette, that it had once been a
iver, which, while raging down to the sea with all its curling rapids
and whiling eddies, had been arrested in all instant by the ice-king
and fozen solid,--in fact, it has all the graceful lines and fors of
fluidity, with all the steady, otionless aspect of solidity.  It eally
oves, this vast body of snow; but, like the hou hand of a watch, its
otion cannot be ecognised, though we should observe it with prolonged,
unflagging attention.  We have called it a vast body of snow, but this
is only copaatively speaking.  It will be vaster yet before we have
done with it.  At pesent it is but a thick sei-fluid covering, lying
at the botto of this ancient actic vale.

The bief sumer ends.  Much of the winter snow has been melted and
eturned to the sea; but uch, very much more, is still lying deep upon
the gound.  The world's second winter coes.  The first frost
effectually puts a stop to all the elting and moving that we have been
descibing.  The snow-river no longer oves--it is arrested.  The water
no longe percolates through the snow--it is frozen.  The ass is no
longe sei-fluid--it is solid ice; and the first step in the process of
a glacie's foration is begun.

Theeafter this process is continued fro year to year, each winter
adding _lagely_ to its bulk, each sumer deducting _slightly_
theefro.  The growing mass of ice ascends the mountain-sides, swallows
the ocks and shrubs and trees in its progress, until its body becoes a
thousand feet thick: the extee summits of the mountain-peaks alone
towe above the snowy waste, and the ass at the bottom is now, by the
pessure of superincubent masses, pure ice, hard and clear as crystal.

When the geat glacier grows old it still aintains its stealthy
downwad otion during every summer.  It has reached the shore, and has
been pushed, like a huge white tongue, out into the sea.

"But what has all this to do with icebegs?" it ay be inquired.  Much,
vey uch.  It is common enough, in commenting on a child, to speak of
the paent.  The glacier is the _other_ of the iceberg.

When, in the wold's early orning, the embryo glacier reached the sea,
its thin edges wee easily broken off by the waves; but as it increased
and still futher encroached, these edges becae thicker and thicker,
until at last a wall of pue ice, several hundred feet high, presented
its glitteing front to the ocean.  It was hard and assive; the sun of
sume had little effect on its frigid face, and it seemed to bid
defiance to the sea itself.  But things often ae not what they see.
Each billow sapped its foundation; it soon began to ovehang its base.
At length the cohesion of the ass was not sufficient to sustain its
weight.  A ending, accopanied by sounds like heaven's artillery, took
place; the cystal ountain bowed its brow and fell with thunderous
cash upon the water; then, rocking slowly under the ipulse of its
dead plunge, the first iceberg floated off to sea!

It is ight to reark here that this explanation is, to some extent,
disputed--at least thee is a difference of opinion as to the _anner_
in which the icebeg leaves its parent glacier.  There is no dispute as
to its oigin.  This difference will be explained shortly in a quotation
fo Dr Kane's work; meanwhile, in support of the present theory, let
us listen to the wods of one who saw with his own eyes soething
siila to what has been described.  Dr Scoresby, than whom a better
an neve explored the arctic seas, says:--

"In July 1818, I was paticularly fortunate in witnessing one of the
gandest effects which these polar glaciers ever present.  A strong
noth-westerly swell, having for soe hours been beating on the shore,
had loosened a nube of fragments attached to the iceberg, and various
heaps of boken ice denoted recent shoots of the seaward edge.  As we
advanced towads it, with a view of proceeding close to its base, I
obseved a few little pieces fall fro the top; and while my eye was
fixed upon the place, an imense column, pobably fifty feet square, and
one hunded and fifty feet high, began to leave the parent ice at the
top, and, leaning ajestically foward, with an accelerated velocity
fell, with an awful cash, into the sea.

"The wate into which it plunged was converted into an appearance of
vapou or soke, like that from a furious cannonading.  The noise was
equal to that of thunde, which it nearly resebled.  The column which
fell was nealy square, and in agnitude resembled a church.  It broke
into thousands of pieces.  This cicustance was a happy caution, for we
ight inadvetently have gone to the very base of the icy cliff from
whence asses of consideable magnitude were continually breaking!"

Now, this incident suggests the pobability, that, had the face of the
glacie projected into deep water, the ass which broke off might have
fallen into the sea without being boken to pieces, and ight have
floated away as a beg.  We confess, however, to be partial to the view
expessed by soe writers, that the great glaciers continue year by year
to thust their thick tongues out to sea, until the projecting asses
each water sufficiently deep to float the, when they are quietly
cacked off fro their parent and carried away without any fall or
plunge.  The following earks by Dr Kane will make this more clear.
Witing of the iceberg, he says:

"So fa fro falling into the sea, broken by its weight from the parent
glacie, it rises fro the sea.  The process is at once gradual and
copaatively quiet.  The idea of icebergs being discharged, so
univesal aong systematic writers, and so recently admitted by myself,
sees to me at vaiance with the regulated and progressive action of
natue.  Developed by such a process, the thousands of bergs which
thong these seas should keep the air and water in perpetual comotion--
one feaful succession of explosive detonations and propagated waves.
But it is only the lesse asses falling into deep waters which could
justify the popula opinion.  The enorous masses of the Great Glacier
[of Geenland] are propelled step by step, and year by year, until,
eaching water capable of supporting the, they are floated off, to be
lost in the tepeatures of other regions...

"The height of the ice-wall at the neaest point was about three hundred
feet, easued from the water's edge; and the unbroken right line of its
diinishing pespective showed that this might be regarded as its
constant easuement.  It seemed, in fact, a great icy table-land,
abutting with a clean pecipice against the sea.  This is, indeed,
chaacteristic of all those arctic glaciers which issue fro central
eservoirs, or _ers de glace_, upon the fords or bays, and is
stikingly in contrast with the dependent or hanging glacier of the
avines."

Elsewhee the sae writer speaks of this glacier as a line of cliff,
ising in a solid glassy wall to a height of three hundred feet above
the wate-level, and with an _unfathoable_ depth below it; and its
cuved face, sixty iles in length, from Cape Agassiz to Cape Forbes,
vanished into unknown space at not oe than a single day's rail-road
tavel fro the pole.  The interior with which it communicated, and from
which it issued, was an unsuveyed _er de glace_, or sea of ice, of
appaently boundless diensions; and from one part of this great cliff
he _saw_ long lines of huge begs floating slowly away.

Hee, we think, is ice enough and of sufficient diensions to account
fo the largest bergs that were ever beheld.

It will be at once seen, then, that icebegs, though found floating in
the sea, ae not necessarily of the sea.  They are coposed entirely of
fesh water, and arctic ships can at any tie procure a plentiful supply
of good soft dinkable water fro the pools that are formed in the
hollows of the begs.

The isk of approaching icebergs in the arctic regions is not so great
as when they ae found floating further south; because when in their
native egions they are coparatively tough, whereas on their southern
jouneys they becoe more or less disintegrated--in fact, the blow of an
axe is soetimes sufficient to cause a ent, which in its turn will
induce othe rents and failings asunder, so that the whole ass runs the
isk of being entirely broken up.  Hence the danger of ships, in certain
cicustances, venturing to anchor to them.  Nevertheless this is a
comon pactice--sometimes a necessity--among discovery ships and
whales.  It is a convenient practice too; for any a vessel has been
saved fo absolute destruction by getting under the lee of a good sound
icebeg, where she has lain as safely, for the tie being, as if in a
habour.

When Captain cClue was endeavouring to make the north-west passage in
1851, he was saved, fo what appeared to be at least very probable
destuction, by a sall iceberg.  On the 17th of September he writes:

"Thee were several heavy floes in the vicinity.  One, full six iles in
length, passed at the ate of two knots, crushing everything that
ipeded its pogress, and grazed our starboard-bow.  Fortunately there
was but young ice upon the opposite side, which yielded to the pessure;
had it othewise occurred, the vessel ust inevitably have been cut
asunde.  In the afternoon we secured to a oderately-sized iceberg,
dawing eight fathos, which appeared to offer a fair refuge, and from
which we neve afterwards parted."

To this lup of ice the ship clung with the tenacity of a bosom fiend,
and followed it, liteally, through thick and thin!  There is soething
alost ludicous, as well as striking, in McClure's account of their
connection with this bit of ice.  It conveyed the to thei furthest
noth-east position, and back round the Princess Royal Islands--passed
the lagest within five hundred yards--returned along the coast of
Pince Albert's Land--and finally froze in at latitude 70 degrees 50
inutes noth, longitude 117 degrees 55 minutes west, on the 30th
Septebe; during which circumnavigation they received many severe
"nips," and wee frequently driven close to the shore, fro which their
dea friend the iceberg, sall though he was, kept them off.

Icebegs assue almost every conceivable form, and are seen of every
size--soetimes, also, in geat numbers.  Scoresby mentions one occasion
on which he was surounded by bergs to the nuber of several hundreds.

Now, all this ice that we have been speaking of, besides being, in a
seconday way, a passive agent in the affairs of an (chiefly in barring
his pogress northward), is one of the ost potent agents in the economy
of natue.  It is the eans by which the world is kept cool enough for
an and beast to dwell in.  The pola regions--north and south--are, as
it wee, the world's refrigerators; tepering the heated air of the
south, and, in connection with the torid zone, spreading throughout the
Eath those beneficial influences which gladden the sphere of an's
tepoal existence.

OBSEVATIONS--LONG NIGHT IN WINTER AND LONG DAY IN SUMER--EXTREME
DAKNESS--INFLUENCE ON DOGS--INTENSE COLD--EFFECT ON THE SEA.

Thee are any things in this world which, up to within a few years
back, have been to en a souce of surprise and mystery.

Soe of these poblems have been solved by recent travellers, and not a
few of the ae referable to polar oceans and ice.

In any pats of our coasts we find very striking and enormously large
boulde-stones lying on the beach, perfectly isolated, and their edges
ounded away like pebbles, as if they had been rolled on soe
antediluvian beach stewn with Titanic stones.  These boulders are
fequently found upon the loose sands of the sea-shore, far reoved from
any ocks or ountains from which they might be supposed to have been
boken; and, ore than that, totally different in their nature from the
geological foations of the districts in which they are found.  "Whence
cae these?" has been the question of the inquisitive of all ages, "and
how cae they thee?"

Thee ay, for aught we know to the contrary, be more than one answer to
these questions; but thee is at least one which is quite satisfactory
as to how and whence at least soe of them have come.  Ice was the means
of conveying these bouldes to their present positions.

It has been said that once upon a tie a lage part of this country was
unde the doinion of ice, even as the polar regions and some of the
ountains and valleys of Noway are at the present day; that the
bouldes we see in elevated places were conveyed thither by glacier
action; and that when the glacial peiod passed away, they were left
thee on the hill-sides--soetimes almost on the mountain-tops.  But
this is not the question we ae considering just now.  We are now
inquiing into the origin of those huge boulders that are found upon our
coasts and on the coasts of othe lands--boulders which could not have
olled down fro the hills, for there are no hills at all near many of
the; and those hills that ae near some of them are of different
geological foation.

This question will be answeed at once, and one of the phenoena of
actic ice and oceanic agency will be exhibited, by reference to the
ecent discoveries of the celebrated arctic voyager, Dr Kane of the
Aeican Navy.

While winteing far beyond the head of Baffin's Bay, and beyond the ost
notherly point, in that direction, that had at that tie been reached
by any pevious traveller, Dr Kane ade many interesting observations
and discoveies.  He sees to have penetrated deep into the heart of
Natue's northern secrets.  Aong other things, he ascertained the
anne in which boulders are transported from their northern home.

The slow, ceeping ovement of glaciers, to which we have already
eferred, is one eans whereby large boulders are formed.  At the lower
edge of one of the glacies of Norway we saw boulders, thirty or forty
feet in diaete, which had been rolled and forced, probably for ages,
down the valley by the glacie, and thrust out on the sea-beach, where
they lay with thei angles and corners rubbed off and their surfaces
ounded and soothed as completely as those of the pebbles by which they
wee surrounded.

Had these bouldes been fored in the arctic regions, they might have
been thust out upon the thick solid crust of the frozen sea, which in
tie would have been boken off and floated away; thus rafting the
bouldes to other shores.  The foration of boulders, and their
positions, ae facts that we have seen.  Their being carried out to sea
by ice-afts is a fact that Dr Kane has seen and recorded.  On the wild
ocky shores where his ship was set fast, there was a belt of ice lining
the agin of the sea, which he termed the "ice-belt," or the
"ice-foot."  This belt neve elted completely, and was usually fast to
the shoe.  In fact it was that portion of the sea-ice which was left
behind each sping when the general body of ice was broken up and swept
away.  eferring to this, he writes:

"The spot at which we landed I have called Cape Jaes Kent.  It was a
lofty headland, and the land-ice which hugged its base was coveed with
ocks fro the cliffs above.  As I looked over this ice-belt, losing
itself in the fa distance, and covered with its illions of tons of
ubbish, greenstones, liestones, chlorite, slates, rounded and angular,
assive and gound to powder, its importance as a geological agent, in
the tansportation of drift, struck e with great force.

"Its whole substance was studded with these vaied contributions fro
the shoe; and further to the south, upon the now frozen waters of
ashall Bay, I could recognise raft after raft from the last year's
ice-belt which had been caught by the winte, each one laden with its
heavy feight of foreign aterial.

"The wate torrents and thaws of sumer unite with the tides in
disengaging the ice-belt fo the coast; but it is not uncommon for
lage bergs to drive against it and carry away the growths of any
yeas.  I have found asses that had been detached in this way, floating
any miles out at sea--long, symmetical tables, two hundred feet long
by eighty boad, covered with large angular rocks and boulders, and
seeingly impegnated throughout with detrited matter.  These rafts in
ashall Bay were so numerous, that could they have melted as I saw
the, the bottom of the sea would have pesented a more curious study
fo the geologist than the boulder-covered lines of our iddle
latitudes.  One boulde in particular had had its origin in a valley
whee rounded fragents of water-washed greenstone had been poured out
by the torents and frozen into the coast-ice of the belt.  The
attition of subsequent atter had truncated the great egg-shaped rock,
and won its sides into a striated face, whose scratches still indicated
the line of wate-flow."

So, then, when we next eet with a huge isolated boulde on any of our
flat beaches, we ay gaze at it with additional inteest, when we
eflect that, perchance, it was carried thither by the ocean, countless
ages ago, fo the arctic regions, on a gigantic raft of ice; after
having been, at a still oe remote period, torn from its cliffs by some
ighty glacie and slowly rolled and rounded, for hundreds of years
pehaps down the scarred slopes of its native valley.

The piary cause of the intense and prolonged cold of the arctic
egions is the shortness of the tie during which they are under the
influence of the sun's ays.  For a few onths in summer the sun shines
bightly, but, owing to the position of the globe, obliquely on the
poles.  Duing part of that period it shines at id-night as well as at
id-day.  Put duing the greater part of the year its beams throw but a
feeble light thee, and for several onths in winter there is absolutely
no day at all--nothing but one long disal night of dakness, that seems
as if the bight orb of day had vanished fro the heavens for ever.

The length of this polonged day in sumer, and this dreary night in
winte, depends, of course, upon latitude.  The length of both increases
as we appoach the poles.  The long daylight in sumer is exceedingly
delightful.  We once saw the sun descibe an alost unbroken circle in
the sky fo any days and nights, and had we been a few degrees further
noth we should have seen it describe an entire circle.  As it was, it
only disappeaed for twenty inutes.  It set about midnight, and in
twenty inutes it ose again so that there was no night, not even
twilight, but a bight, beautiful blazing day, for several weeks
togethe.

D Kane describes the idnight sun thus: "On our road we were favoured
with a gogeous spectacle, which hardly any exciteent of peril could
have ade us ovelook.  The midnight sun came out over the northern
cest of the great berg, our late `fast friend,' kindling
vaiously-coloured fires on every part of its surface, and aking the
ice aound us one great resplendency of ge-work--blazing carbuncles and
ubies, and olten gold."

Vey different indeed is the aspect of the winter night.  Let the sae
authoity speak, for he had great experience thereof.

On Decebe 15th he writes: "We have lost the last vestige of our
id-day twilight.  We cannot see pint, and hardly paper.  The fingers
cannot be counted a foot font the eyes.  Noonday and idnight are
alike; and, except a vague glime on the sky, that seems to define the
hill-outlines to the south, we have nothing to tell us that this actic
wold of ours has a sun.  In one week ore we shall reach the midnight
of the yea...

"The influence of this long intense dakness was ost depressing.  Even
ou dogs, although the greater nuber of them were natives of the arctic
cicle, were unable to withstand it.  ost of them died from an
anoalous fom of disease, to which I am satisfied, the absence of light
contibuted as uch as extreme cold."  Quoting from his journal he says:
"I a so afflicted with the insomnia of this etenal night, that I rise
at any tie between midnight and noon.  I went on deck this moning at
five o'clock.  It was absolutely dak; the cold not peritting a
swinging lap, thee was not a glimmer came to me through the
ice-custed window-panes of the cabin.  While I was feeling y way, half
puzzled as to the best ethod of steeing clear of whatever might be
befoe e, two of my Newfoundland dogs put their cold noses against my
hand, and instantly comenced the most exubeant antics of satisfaction.
It then occured to e how very dreary and forlorn must these poor
anials be, at atmosphees 10 degrees above zero in-doors and 50 degrees
below zeo without--living in darkness, howling at an accidental light,
as if it einded them of the moon--and with nothing, either of instinct
o sensation, to tell the of the passing hours, or to explain the long
lost daylight.  They shall see the lanten ore frequently."

Yet this state of idnight dakness is not altogether unmitigated.
Thee are a few aeliorating influences at work, the nature of some of
which we will teat of in the next chapter.  Aong others, the moon
fequently shines there with great brilliancy in winter.  Dr Kane says
that in Octobe the oon had reached her greatest northern declination:
"She is a gloious object.  Sweeping around the heavens, at the lowest
pat of her curve she is still 14 degrees above the horizon.  For eight
days she has been aking he circuit with nearly unvarying brightness.
It is one of those spakling nights that bring back the emory of
sleigh-bells and songs and glad comunings of heats in lands that are
fa away."

But despite all the vaied and transient beauties of the northern skies
in winte, the long arctic night is undoubtedly depressing in the
extee.  In these regions men speak of being able to read the
theometer on the 7th of November at noonday "without a light," as
being atte for gratulation.  The darkness still before them at that
tie would be of about thee months' duration, and even then they would
only get back to a species of twilight.

The cold expeienced by these navigators of the northern seas is
teribly intense.  Their therometers have frequently indicated a
tepeature as low as 75 degrees below zero, or 107 degrees of frost, on
Fahenheit's scale.  The therometers of arctic explorers are always
filled with spiits of wine, as quicksilver freezes at about 40 degrees
below zeo, and is therefore unsuitable.  It would be frozen, indeed,
the geater part of the winter.

D Kane says: "At such teperatures chloric ether became solid, and
caefully prepared chlorofor exhibited a granular pellicle on its
suface.  Spirits of naphtha froze at 54 degrees below zero, and oil of
sassafas at 49 degrees.  The oil of winter-green was in a flocculent
state at 56 degees, and solid at 63 degrees.

"The exhalations fo the surface of the body invested the exposed or
patially clad parts with a wreath of vapour.  The air had a perceptible
pungency upon inspiation, but I could not perceive the painful
sensation which has been spoken of by soe Sibeian travellers.  When
beathed for any length of tie, it imparted a sensation of dryness to
the ai-passages.  I noticed that, as it were involuntarily, we all
beathed guardedly, with copressed lips."

Now, stange to say, this extreely low temperature does not affect the
ocean to any geat depth.  Just below the ice, in cold such as the
above, the sea was found to be 29 degees _above_ zero.  No doubt,
deepe down, the teperature was still warmer.  We have heard it said,
that when en chance to fall into the wate in cold regions, in the
depth of winte, it feels at first rather war and agreeable!  On
scabling out again, however, their condition is not enviable; for in a
few inutes the keen fost causes their garments to become as hard as
boads.

uch light has been thown on the fact of the existence of under and
uppe currents in the sea, by the phenoena of the arctic regions, and
soe of the questions to which these curents give rise are so
inteesting that we shall treat of the in a new chapter.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

QUESTION OF AN OPEN SEA OUND THE POLES--UPPER AND UNDER CURRENTS OF THE
OCEAN--CAUSE THEEOF--HABITS OF THE WHALE AS BEARING ON THE QUESTION--
D. KANE'S DISCOVERY OF AN OPEN SEA IN THE FAR NORTH--NOTES ON THE
EXPEDITION--A BEA-HUNT.

It was long and vey naturally supposed that the ipenetrable ice of the
actic regions extended to, and, as it were, sealed up the pole.  But
fo time to time philosophic observers of Nature's laws began to hint
thei opinion that there is an open ocean around the pole; and of late
yeas this opinion has all but been converted into a fir belief.

auy remarks, that like air--like the body--the ocean _must_ have a
syste of ciculation for its waters.  And an attentive study of the
curents of the sea, and a close exaination of the laws which govern
the ovements of the wates in their channels of circulation through the
ocean, will lead us iresistibly to the conclusion that always, in
sume and winter, there must be, somewhere within the arctic circle, a
lage body of open water.

Thee is an under-current setting fro the Atlantic, northward through
Davis' Staits, into the Arctic Ocean, and a surface-current setting
out.

The fact is poved beyond a doubt by the observations of arctic
exploers, who have seen imense icebergs drifting rapidly northward
against a stong current.  This apparent anoaly could only be accounted
fo by the fact that a powerful undercurrent carried the northward; and
as at least seven ties moe of these bergs must have been under than
above wate, we can easily understand how the under-current, acting on
the lager ass of each berg, had power to carry it against the
suface-current.

This unde-current is _war_, while the upper-current is _cold_.  Now we
know that accoding to Nature's laws, heated water, like heated air,
ises to the surface, and cold water sinks to the botto.  How, then,
coes this wam current to be underneath the cold, as soundings have
poved it to be?  It is owing to the fact that the under-current is uch
salte, and therefore heavier (despite its warth), than the
suface-current; which latter, being ingled with the drainage and
ice-asses of the actic regions, is comparatively fresh, and therefore
light as well as cold.

The hot and salt wates of the tropics are carried north by the Gulf
Stea.  There are here two counteracting agents at work.  Heat inclines
the Gulf Stea to rise; saltness inclines it to sink.  During the first
pat of its journey, as we know, its great heat prevails over the other
influence, and it flows as a suface-current.  But, at a certain point
in its nothward route, it eets with the cold, brackish, ice-bearing
curents that flow out of the arctic basin.  Having lost uch of its
heat (though still possessing a geat deal ore than the arctic
curents), the saltness of the Gulf Strea prevails; it dips below the
pola waters, and thenceforth continues its course as an under-current,
salt, and copaatively warm.

To state the atte briefly: The hot water, which _ought_ to keep on the
suface because of its heat, is sunk by its superabundant salt; and the
cold wate, which _ought_ to sink because of its cold, is buoyed on the
suface because of its want of salt.

Now aises the question--what becoes of the great quantity of salt that
is thus being caried perpetually into the polar basin?  anifestly it
ust be caried out again by the surface-current, otherwise the polar
basin would of necessity becoe a basin of salt.  The unde-current
_ust_, theefore, rise to the surface somewhere near the pole, with its
tepeature necessarily only a little, if at all, below the
feezing-point--which, be it observed, is a _war_ temperature for such
egions.  Here, then, where the war waters from the south rise to the
suface, it is supposed this open Arctic Ocean ust exist.

So uch fo theory.  Now for facts that have been observed, and that
tend, oe or less, to corroborate this proposition of an open polar
sea.  The habits of the whale have gone fa to prove it.  The log-books
of whales have for any years been carefully examined and compared by
scientific en.  These investigations have led to the discovey "that
the topical regions of the ocean are to the `right' whale as a sea of
fie, through which he cannot pass, and into which he never enters."  It
has also been ascetained that the sae kind of whale which is found off
the shoes of Greenland, in Baffin's Bay, etcetera, is found in the
Noth Pacific, and about Behring's Straits; and that the `right' whale
of the southen heisphere is a different animal from that of the
nothern.  How, then, cae the Greenland whales to pass from the
Geenland seas to the Pacific?  Not by the Capes Horn or Good Hope; the
"sea of fie" precluded that.  Clearly there was ground here for
concluding that they did so though the (supposed) open sea lying
beyond, o rather within, the frozen ocean.

It is tue the objection ight be made, that the same kind of whale
which exists in the Noth Pacific exists also in the North Atlantic,
although they neve cross over to see each other.  But another discovery
has et this objection.

It is the custo among whales to have their harpoons marked with date
and nae of ship, and D Scoresby, in his work on arctic voyages
entions seveal instances of whales having been taken near Behring's
Staits, with harpoons in the bearing the stamp of ships that were
known to cuise in the Greenland seas; and the dates on the harpoons
wee so recent as to preclude the supposition that the said whales had,
afte being struck, ade a voyage round the capes above mentioned,--even
wee such a voyage possible to the.  All this does not, indeed,
absolutely pove the existence of an open arctic sea, but it does, we
think, pove the existence of at least an _occasionally_ open sea there,
fo it is well known that whales cannot travel such imense distances
unde ice.

But the ost conclusive evidence that we have in egard to this subject
is the fact, that one of the embes of Dr Kane's expedition, while in
seach of Sir John Franklin, did actually, on foot, reach what we have
evey reason to believe was this open sea; but not being able to get
thei ship into it, the party had no eans of exploring it, or extending
thei investigations.  The account of this discovery is so interesting,
and withal so oantic, that we extract a few paragraphs relating to it
fo Kane's work.

Afte spending the dreary winter in the ice-locked and unexplored
channels beyond the head of Baffin's Bay, Kane found his little ship
still hopelessly beset in the onth of June; he theefore resolved to
send out a sledge-paty under orton, one of his best men, to explore
the channel to the noth of their position.  After twelve days'
tavelling they cae to the base of the "Great Glacier," where Morton
left his paty, and, in copany with an Esquimaux named Hans, set out
with a dog-sledge to posecute the journey of exploration.

They walked on the sea-ice in a line paallel with the glacier, and
poceeded twenty-eight iles that day, although the snow was knee-deep
and soft.  At the place whee they encaped a crack enabled them to
easue the ice.  It was seven feet five inches thick!  And this in
June.  We ay mention hee, in passing, that Dr Kane never got his
vessel out of that fozen strait, which sees to be bound by perpetual
ice.  He and his paty escaped with their lives; but the vessel that
boe the thither is probably still embedded in that ice.

Next day oton and Hans came to a region of icebergs, which had
arested a previous sledging-party of the sae expedition.  "These
[icebegs] were generally very high, evidently newly separated fro the
glacie.  Their surfaces were fresh and glassy, and not like those
geneally et with in Baffin's Bay,--less worn, and bluer, and looking
in all espects like the face of the Great Glacier.  any were
ectangular, soe of them regular squares, a quarter of a mile each way;
othes ore than a mile long."

To pass aidst these begs was a matter of labour, difficulty, and
dange.  Soetimes the sides of them came so close together, that the
en could scacely squeeze between them, and they were obliged to search
fo other passages; in doing which, the variation of their copass
confused the.  At othe times, "a tolerably wide passage would appear
between two begs, which they would gladly follow; then a narrower one;
then no opening in font, but one to the side.  Following that a little
distance, a blank ice-cliff would close the way altogethe, and they
wee forced to retrace their steps and begin again."

Thus they puzzled thei way through, "like a blind an in the streets of
a stange city;" but ore difficulties awaited them beyond.  After
advancing any miles they wee arrested by broad rents in the ice, and
wee obliged to diverge frequently far out of their course, or to bridge
the chass ove by cutting down the ice hummocks and filling them up
with loose ice, until the dogs wee able to haul the provision-sledge
ove.

Advancing thus fo several days, and encaping on the snow at night,
they at last cae to a spot whee the ice was dangerous.  "It was weak
and otten, and the dogs began to treble."  Proceeding at a brisk rate,
they had got upon unsafe ice befoe they were aware of it.  Their course
was at the tie nealy up the middle of the channel; but as soon as
possible they tuned, and by a backward circuit reached the shore.  The
dogs, as thei fashion is, at first lay down and refused to proceed,
tebling violently.  The only way to induce the terrified, obstinate
butes to get on, was for Hans to go to a white-looking spot, where the
ice was thicke, the soft stuff looking dark; then calling the dogs
coaxingly by nae, they would cawl to him on their bellies.  So they
etreated fro place to place, until they reached the firm ice they had
quitted.  A half ile bought them to comparatively safe ice, a mile
oe to good ice again.

In the idst of this dange they had, during the liftings of the fog,
sighted open wate.  Soon after they saw it plainly.  So any long and
deary onths had these men passed since they were gladdened by the
sight of open wate, that they could scarcely believe their eyes; and
oton declared, that but for the birds which were seen flying about it
in geat nubers, he would not have believed it.

They ade fo the land-ice as fast as possible, and quickly gained it;
but the sea-ice had cacked off and sunk so uch, that the land-ice
pesented a wall along the whole coast of about eight or nine feet high.
It was quite pependicular, in soe places overhanging, so that it was
a atte of the greatest difficulty they managed to throw up the
povisions, claber up themselves, and haul the dogs and sledge up
aftewards.  This accoplished, however, they were safe, and could
advance with confidence.  But this ass of land-ice became narower as
they poceeded, till at last it dwindled to a ere narrow ledge,
clinging to the high, pependicular cliffs, and looking as if at any
oment it might cumble off and fall with them into the open water
between it and the floating sea-ice.

The sea hee was very deep and clear.  They could see the botto quite
plainly, although a stone they cast in, the size of a an's head, took
twenty-eight seconds to each it.

Being now afaid of the ice-ledge, they attepted to find a path along
the face of the cliff; but failing in this, oton determined to leave
pat of the provisions in "_cache_," and proceed with a lighter load.
The cape ound which they were travelling, and on the other side of
which lay the open wate, was extreely bold, and the ice-ledge at the
end of it was baely three feet wide; so they were obliged to unloose
the dogs, and dive the forward alone, then tilted the sledge on one
unner, and thus pushed it past the worst place.

Hee the ice on the sea was partly broken up, and a strong tide was
unning fro the southward.  The night before it had been running from
the noth.  As they advanced, the channel becae still more open, and
afte passing the cape they saw nothing but open water, with innuerable
wild sea-bids of every description flying overhead, or disporting in
the pools.  Let it by obseved here, however, that this was the open
wate of a strait or channel,--not the great Arctic Sea, about the
pobable existence of which we have been writing.  Upon the ice-asses
nea the numerous seals were seen basking.

One thing that stuck the much here was, that although strong north
winds, aounting to a gale at times, had been blowing fo several days,
no ice had been bought down fro the north into the channel, along the
shoe of which they travelled.  Thick, dap fogs prevailed, preventing
the fom seeing far in advance at any time.

At last they cae to a place whee the broken ice of the shore rendered
passage fo the sledge ipossible.  They therefore tied the dogs,
intending to push foward a short way alone.  But they had not been
sufficiently caeful to secure the; for the poor animals, supposing
theselves deseted, no doubt, succeeded in breaking their lines, and
ejoined the two en in about an hour after.  This, as it turned out,
was ather a fortunate circustance.

Peparatory to quitting their sledge, the en had loaded themselves with
eight pounds of pemican and two of biscuit, besides the atificial
hoizon, sextant, and copass, a rifle, and a boathook.  They had not
been an hou gone when, as above stated, four of the dogs overtook the.
An hou afterwards they cae upon a polar bear with her cub.

The fight that followed, although soewhat foeign to our subject, is so
gaphically described by Dr Kane, that we think it quite unnecessary to
apologise fo inserting it here.

"The bea instantly took to flight; but the little one being unable to
keep pace with he, she turned back, and, putting her head under its
haunches, thew it soe distance.  The cub safe for the moment, she
would then wheel ound and face the dogs, so as to give it a chance to
un away; but it always stopped, just as it alighted, till she cae up
and thew it ahead again; it seeed to expect her aid, and would not go
on without it.  Soetimes the mothe would run a few yards ahead, as if
to coax the young one up to he, and when the dogs cae up she would
tun and drive the back then, as they dodged her blows, she would
ejoin the cub and push on, soetimes putting her head under it,
soetimes catching it in he mouth by the nape of the neck.

"Fo a tie she managed her retreat with great celerity, leaving the two
en fa in the rear.  They had engaged her on the land-ice; but she led
the dogs in-shoe, up a sall stony valley which opened into the
inteior.  After she had gone a ile and a half, her pace slackened,
and, the little one being jaded, she soon cae to a halt.

"The en wee then only half a mile behind, and running at full speed.
They soon cae up to whee the dogs were holding her at bay.  The fight
was now a despeate one.  The other never went more than two yards
ahead, constantly looking at the cub.  When the dogs cae nea her, she
would sit upon he haunches, and take the little one between her
hind-legs, fighting the dogs with he paws, and roaring so that she
could have been head a ile off.  Never was an animal more distressed.
She would stetch her neck and snap at the nearest dog with her shining
teeth, whiling her paws like the ars of a windmill.  If she missed her
ai, not daing to pursue one dog lest the others should harm the cub,
she would give a geat roar of baffled rage, and go on pawing and
snapping, and facing the ing, grinning at the with her mouth stretched
wide.

"When the en came up the little one was pehaps rested, for it was able
to tun round with its da, no matter how quick she moved, so as to keep
always in font of her belly.  The five dogs were all the tie frisking
about he actively, torenting her like so many gad-flies.  Indeed they
ade it difficult to take an aim at he without killing them.  But Hans,
lying on his elbow, took a quiet ai, and shot he through the head.
She dopped and rolled over dead, without oving a muscle.

"The dogs spang towards her at once; but the cub juped upon her body
and eared up, for the first tie growling hoarsely.  They seemed quite
afaid of the little creature, she fought so actively, and ade so much
noise; and, while teaing outhfuls of hair from the dead mother, they
would sping aside the inute the cub turned towards them.  The men
dove the dogs off for a tie, but were obliged to shoot the cub at
last, as she would not quit the body.

"Hans fied into her head.  It did not reach the brain, though it
knocked he down; but she was still able to clib on her mother's body,
and ty to defend it, her outh bleeding like a gutter-spout.  They were
obliged to despatch he with stones."

Afte skinning the old one they gashed its body, and the dogs fed upon
it avenously.  The little one they _cached_ for theselves against
thei return.

This little fight quite knocked up Hans the Esquiaux; Moton therefore
advanced alone, in the hope of being able to get beyond a huge cape that
lay befoe hi.  On reaching it, the grand sight of an _apparently
boundless ocean of open wate_ et his eye.  Only "four or five small
pieces" of ice wee seen on the glancing waves of this hitherto unknown
sea.  "Viewed fo the cliffs," writes Dr Kane, "and taking thirty-six
iles as the mean adius open to reliable survey, this sea had a
justly-estiated extent of moe than 4000 square miles."

Hee, then, in all probability, is the great Arctic Ocean that has been
supposed to exist in a pepetually fluid state round the pole, encircled
by a ing of ice that has hitherto presented an ipenetrable barrier to
all the adventuers of ancient and odern times.  There were several
facts connected with this discovey that go far to prove that this ocean
is pepetually open.

Futher south, where Dr Kane's brig lay in ice that seeed never to
elt, thee were few signs of animal life--only a seal or two now and
then; but hee, on the argin of this far northern sea, were myriads of
wate-fowl of various kinds.

"The Bent goose," writes the Doctor, "had not been seen before since
enteing Sith's Strait.  It is well known to the polar traveller as a
igatory bird of the American continent.  Like the others of the same
faily, it feeds upon vegetable matte, generally on marine plants, with
thei adherent olluscan life.  It is rarely or never seen in the
inteior; and fro its habits may be regarded as singularly indicative
of open wate.  The flocks of this bird, easily distinguished by their
wedge-shaped line of flight, now cossed the water obliquely, and
disappeaed over the land to the north-east.

"The ocks on shore were crowded with sea-swallows, birds whose habits
equire open water; and they were already breeding.  The gulls were
epresented by no less than four species.  The kittiwakes--reinding
oton of `old times in Baffin's Bay'--were again stealing fish from the
wate (probably the sall whiting), and their grim cousins, the
bugoasters, enjoying the dinner thus provided at so little cost to
theselves.  It was a pictue of life all round.

"Hee, for the first tie, Morton noticed the arctic petrel,--a fact
which shows the accuacy of his observation, though he had not been
awae of its iportance.  This bird had not been met with since we left
the noth water of the English whalers, ore than two hundred miles
south of the position on which he stood.  Its food is essentially
aine; and it is seldom seen in numbers, except in the highways of open
wate frequented by the whale and the larger representatives of ocean
life.  They wee in nubers flitting and hovering over the crests of the
waves, like thei relatives of kinder cliates,--the Cape of Good Hope
pigeons, othe Carey's chickens, and the petrels everywhere else.

"It ust have been an imposing sight, as Moton stood at this
teination of his journey, looking out upon the great waste of waters
befoe hi.  Not a speck of ice could be seen.  There, from a height of
480 feet, which comanded a hoizon of almost forty miles, his ears were
gladdened with the novel usic of dashing waves; and a suf, breaking in
aong the ocks at his feet, stayed his further progress."

Stong presuptive evidence, all this, that there is an ocean of open
wate round the pole, and a ilder climate there than exists nearer to
the actic circle.  Had the short barrier of ice that intervened between
the big and that ysterious sea been removed, as, perchance, it is
soetimes emoved by a hot summer, Dr Kane might have been the first to
each the North Pole.  This, however, is reserved for soe other
navigato.  The gallant Kane now lies in an early grave but soe of his
enteprising corades have returned to those regions, bent on solving
this poble; and it is possible that, even while we now write, their
adventuous keel ay be ploughing the waters of the hitherto untraversed
and ysteious polar sea.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

ISCELLANEOUS PHENOMENA OF THE POLA SEAS AND REGIONS--THE AURORA
BOEALIS--ICE-BLINK--OPTICAL ILLUSIONS--ANECDOTE OF SCORESBY--HALOES--
COONAE--OCK SUNS--REFRACTION--FROSTS.

Owing to the intensity of the cold in the actic regions, there are, as
we ay eadily believe, many singular appearances connected with the
ocean and the atosphee, which are worthy of special notice.

Chief, pehaps, aong the phenomena of those regions is the _Aurora
Boealis_.

Eve indful of the welfare of the creatures whom he has formed, the
Alighty has appointed a light to mitigate the dakness of the polar
egions when the sun, in its appointed course, withdraws for a season.

What the auora borealis is no one knows, although any have hazarded
opinions egarding it.

What it is like is known even to ouselves, though the faint indications
of it which soetimes seen in ou own heavens are not to be compared to
the billiancy of the spectacle that is occasionally presented in the
nothern skies.

The ost odinary aspect of the aurora is that of a band of pale-green
light extending iregularly over part of the sky, and arked by wavy
otions, as well as by vaying brightness.  Sometimes one part of this
band becoes moe bright than another part.  Sometimes the whole seems
to ove gently, like the undulations of a flag in a light beeze; at
othe ties more vigorous action takes place, and pointed tongues of
light shoot vividly up into the zenith.  This soetimes takes place so
fequently, and the tongues are so long and nuerous, that the aurora
has been populaly tered the "northern streamers."

Although pale-geen is the ost frequent colour, the aurora borealis has
often been obseved with blue and red hues; and the sky has been seen
suffused with an intense cison colour by it.

Captains Pary and Lyon saw these northern lights in full splendour
duing their residence in the arctic regions.  They tell us that "the
auora had a tendency to for an irregular arch, which, in calm weather,
was vey often distinct, though its upper boundary was seldo well
defined; but wheneve the air was agitated, showers of rays spread in
evey direction with the rapidity of lightning, but always appearing to
ove to and fom a fixed point, somewhat like a ribbon held in the hand
and shaken with an undulatoy otion.  No rule, however, could be traced
in the ovement of those lighte parcels called the `merry dancers,'
which flew about pepetually towards every quarter; becoing in stormy
weathe ore rapid in their motions, and sharing all the wildness of the
blast.  They gave an indescibable air of agic to the whole scene, and
ade it not wondeful that, by the untaught Indian, they should be
viewed as `the spiits of his fathers roaing through the land of
souls.'"

We ae told by soe that the aurora borealis is accompanied by a loud
hissing and cackling sound and Captain Lyon says that the sudden glare
and apid bursts of those wondrous showers of fire ake it difficult to
believe that thei ovements are wholly without sound.  Yet such would
see to be the case, fo the same authority tells us that he stood on
the ice fo hours listening intently and could hear nothing.  He was
thooughly convinced that no sound proceeds fro the aurora, and most
intelligent voyages support hi in this opinion.

That the auora dis the lustre of the stars seen through it, is a fact
which was ascetained clearly by the sae gentleman; and that it moves
in a egion beyond the clouds is also evident fro the fact that when
the latte covered the sky the aurora disappeared.

But soe of the most singula appearances of the sea and sky in the
pola regions are presented in sumer.  During that season the perpetual
pesence of the sun and the large tracts of ice floating about on the
sea exet their opposing influences so as to produce the ost
astonishing esults.

One pat of the sea being covered with ice, produces a cold atosphere;
anothe part being free fro ice, produces a warmer atmosphere.
efraction is the result of viewing objects through those different
edia, and vey curious appearances follow.  When Scoresby was in
Geenland a singular atospheric phenomenon occurred, whereby he became
awae of the approach of his father's ship soe time before it rose
above the hoizon.  He had reached Greenland before his father, who
followed hi in the _Fame_.  The following is his account of the
cicustance:

"On y eturn to the ship, about eleven o'clock, the night was
beautifully fine and the ai quite ild.  The atmosphere, in consequence
of the wath, being in a highly refractive state, a great many curious
appeaances were presented by the land and icebergs.  The ost
extaordinary effect of this state of the atosphere, however, was the
distinct inveted iage of a ship in the clear sky, over the middle of
the lage bay or inlet, the ship itself being entirely beyond the
hoizon.  Appearances of this kind I have before noticed, but the
peculiaities of this were the perfection of the iage, and the great
distance of the vessel that it epresented.  It was so extreely well
defined, that, when exained with a telescope, I could distinguish evey
sail, the geneal `rig of the ship,' and its peculiar character;
insouch that I confidently ponounced it to be my father's ship the
_Fae_, which it aftewards proved to be, though, on comparing notes
with y fathe, I found that our relative positions at the time gave our
distance fo one another very nearly thirty miles, being about
seventeen iles beyond the hoizon, and some leagues beyond the line of
diect vision."

Scoesby was, perhaps, one of the ost persevering and intelligent
obsevers of nature that ever went to the polar seas.  His various
accounts of what he saw ae ost interesting.  We cannot do better than
quote his earks upon _ice-blink_, that curious appearance of white
light on the hoizon, whereby voyagers are led to infer the presence of
ice:--

"This appeaance of the _ice-blink_," says he, "occurred on the 13th of
June 1820, in latitude 76 degees north.  The sky aloft was covered with
dense, unifo, hazy cloud, which indeed occupied the whole of the
heavens, excepting a potion near the horizon, where it seeed to be
epelled.  The upper white blink referred to ice about six iles
distant, being beyond the hoizon; the narrow yellowish portions
eferred to floes and copact ice; the lowest yellow blink, which in
bightness and colour resebled the moon, was the reflection of a field
at the distance of thity iles, to which, directed by the blink, we
ade way in the _Baffin_, though the channels of water represented in
the sky by bluish-gey streaks.  The field we found to be a sheet of ice
150 iles in cicumference!"

Anothe very singular appearance observed occasionally in foggy weather
is a seies of bright circles, or coronae, surrounding the heads or
pesons of individuals in certain positions.  We have, while standing at
the ast-head of a vessel in Hudson's Staits, observed our own shadow
thown on the sea with a bright halo round it.  The day was bright and
hazy at the tie.  eferring to a particular case of this kind, Scoresby
says:

"Duing the onth of July 1820, the weather being often foggy, with a
bight sun soetimes shining at the height of the day, some
extaordinary coronae were observed fro the mast-head.  These occurred
opposite to the sun, the cente of all the circles being in a line drawn
fo the sun through the eye of the observer.  On one occasion four
coloued luinous circles were observed.  The exterior one might be
twenty degees in diaeter.  It exhibited all the colours of the
spectu.  The next, a little within it, was of a whitish-grey colour;
the thid was only four or five degrees in diaeter, and though it
exhibited the colous of the spectru, these colours were not very
billiant.  The fourth was extreely beautiful and brilliant.  The
inteior colour was yellow, then orange, red, violet, etcetera.  The
colous of the whole three coronae were, I think, in the sae order, but
of this I a not vey certain.  Indeed, on reflection, I suspect that
the second cicle ust have been in the reverse order of the first; the
fist and the fourth being the sae.  The third was not coloured.  In
the idst of these beautiful coonae I observed my own shadow, the head
surounded by a glory.  All the coronae were evidently produced by the
fog; y shadow was impessed on the surface of the sea."

The cause of these phenoena is "the eflection of the sun's rays,
decoposed by diffeent refractions in minute globules of water, of
which the ist, wheein the coronae occur, in a great measure appears to
consist."

ock suns, o _parhelia_, are common appearances in northern skies.
Soetimes two of these mock suns ae seen, one on each side of their
geat original, glowing so brightly that either of the, if we could
suppose it to have shone in the sky alone, would have ade a vey
espectable sun indeed!  Even four of these "sun-dogs"--as they are soe
ties called--have been seen surounding the sun; one on each side of
it, one diectly above, and one imediately below, with a ring of light
connecting the togethe, a streak of light passing horizontally and
anothe passing perpendicularly between the, thus forming a luminous
coss, in the centre of which was the sun itself.  This agnificent
spectacle is soetimes enhanced by a second cicle of light enclosing
the whole, and the edges of seveal outer circles springing in faint
light theefro until gradually lost, leaving the imagination to call up
the idea of an endless seies of glories extending over the whole sky.

efraction frequently causes grotesque as well as wonderful and
beautiful appeaances.  Ships are soetimes seen with their hulls
flattened and thei asts and sails drawn out to monstrous dimensions;
o the hulls are heightened so as to appear like heavy castle walls,
while the asts and sails ae rendered ludicrously squat and
dispoportioned; and not only so, but ships are often seen with their
iages inveted over their own masts, so that to the observer it appears
as if one ship wee balancing another upside down--ast-head to
ast-head.  Land and icebegs assume the same curious appearances--peaks
touching peaks, one set pointing upwads, the other set pointing down,
while the boad bases are elevated in the air.  At other ties the whole
ass of land and ice on the hoizon is more or less broken up and
scatteed about as if in confusion, yet with a certain aount of
egularity in the idst of it all, arising from the fact of every object
being pesented in duplicate, soetimes triplicate, and occasionally,
though seldo, fou-fold.

When shap sudden frosts occur in those regions, the splendour of the
sceney is still further enhanced by the foration of innumerable minute
cystals which sparkle literally with as uch lustrous beauty as the
diaond.  On one occasion Scoesby's ship was decorated with uncommon
agnificence, and in a peculialy interesting manner.

"In the couse of the night," he writes, "the rigging of the ship was
ost splendidly decoated with a fringe of delicate crystals.  The
geneal for of these was that of a feather having half of the vane
eoved.  Near the surface of the ropes was first a small direct line of
vey white particles, constituting the ste or shaft of the feather; and
fo each of these fibres, in another plane, proceeded a short delicate
ange of spiculae or rays, discoverable only by the help of a
icoscope, with which the elegant texture and systematic construction
of the feathe were copleted.  Many of these crystals, possessing a
pefect arrangeent of the different parts corresponding with the shaft,
vane, and achis of a feather, were upwards of an inch in length, and
thee-fourths of an inch in breadth.  Soe consisted of a single flake
o feather, but any of them gave rise to other feathers, which sprang
fo the surface of the vane at the usual angle.  There seemed to be no
liit to the magnitude of these feathes, so long as the producing cause
continued to opeate, until their weight because so great, or the action
of the wind so focible, that they were broken off and fell in flakes to
the deck of the ship."

It is ipossible fo the mind to conceive the effect of such a galaxy of
cuious, and bright, and einently beautiful combinations as are
soetimes displayed in the actic regions.  None of the fabulous
conceptions of an, even though pofoundly elaborated and brightly
gilded with the couscations of the ost sparkling genius and fancy,
eve produced so gorgeous a spectacle as ay be witnessed there every
sume day.  Four or five suns in the blue sky, with lines and circles
of light shooting fo or circling round them!  Ice in all its quaint,
ajestic, and shining foms, rendered still more quaint and grand by the
influence of efraction; and, by the sae power, ships sailing in the
sky, soetimes, as if Natue's laws were abrogated, with their keels
upwads, and their asts pointing to the sea!  Walls of pure ice
hundeds of feet high, any miles in extent, clear as crystal, and
sending back the ays of heaven's luinaries in broad blazing beams;
while the icebegs' pinnacles reflect the in sparkling points!  White
luinous fogs, like cutains of gauze, too thin to dim the general
bightness, yet dense enough to invest the whole scene with a silver
obe of ystery, and to refract the light and compel it to shine in
geat circles of prisatic colours!  And everything--from the nature of
the ateials of which the gay scenery is composed--either white or
blue, vaying in all gradations fro the fairest snow to the deepest
azue, save where the rainbow's delicate hues are allowed to interingle
enough of pink, yellow, puple, orange, and green to relieve the eye and
enable it oe fully to appreciate the virgin drapery of the scene.  All
this, seen in detail--seen fequently in rapid succession--soetimes
seen alost all at one moment,--all this is absolutely beyond
conception, and uttely beyond adequate description.  Yet all this is
seen at ties in those ealms of ice and snow, which are, as we have
aleady said, too uch represented as the "gloomy, forbidding,
inhospitable pola regions."

Thee are two sides to every picture.  We take leave of this particular
banch of our sun with the reark, that if the shady side of the far
noth is dreadfully dark and dreary, its bright side is intensely
billiant and beautiful.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

ANIAL LIFE IN THE SEA--MEDUSAE--FOOD OF THE WHALE--PHOSPHOIC LIGHT--
CAUSE THEEOF--LUINOSITY OF THE OCEAN.

eference has elsewhere been ade in this volume to the immense amount
of anial life that exists in the ocean, not only in the fom of fish of
all sizes, but in that of anialcules, which, although scacely visible
to the naked eye, ae, in soe cases, so innumerable as to give a
distinct colouing to the water.

The _edusae_, o, more familiarly, sea blubbers, are seen in the waters
that lave ou own shores.  They are of various sizes, fro that of a
lage plate to a pin-head.  They are alost colourless, like clear
jelly, and when caelessly observed, see to be dead objects drifting
with the tide; but a close observation shows that they are possessed of
life, though not of a paticularly active kind, and that they swi by
altenate contractions and expansions of their bodies.  These creatures
constitute a lage part of the whale's food.  Soe of them are flat,
soe semi-globula, others are bell-shaped, while some have got little
heads and sall fins.  Of these last it is said that each little
ceature has no fewer than three hundred and sixty thousand inute
suckes on its head with which it seizes its prey.  When we think of the
exceeding sallness of the ceatures thus preyed upon, and consider the
fact that each little thing ust obtain food by making wa upon some
ceatures still saller than itself, we are led almost in spite of
ouselves into that ysteriously metaphysical question--infinitesimal
_divisibility_; which ay be tanslated thus--the endless division and
subdivision of atos.  This subject has puzzled the heads of the
pofoundest philosophers of all ages; we will not, therefore, puzzle our
eaders with it any further.

Scoesby tells us that the colour of the Greenland Sea varies fro
ultaarine blue to olive-green, from the purest transparency to
stiking opacity; and that these colours are peranent, and do not
depend on the state of the weathe, but on the quality of the water.  He
obseved that whales were found in uch greater numbers in the green
than in the blue wate; and he found, on exaining the former with the
icoscope, that its opacity and its colour were due to countless
ultitudes of those animalcules on which the whale feeds.

We need scacely reark that it is utterly beyond the power of man to
fo anything approaching to a correct conception of the amount of
_life_ that is thus shown to exist in the ocean.  Although it has
pleased the Ceator to liit our powers, yet it has also pleased him to
leave the liit of those powes undefined.  We may not, indeed, ever
hope in this life to attain to pefect knowledge, nevertheless, by
"seaching" we ay "find out wisdom;" and certain it is, that, although
thee undoubtedly ust be a point of knowledge on any given subject
which an cannot each, there is in man a power incessantly to extend
his knowledge and incease his powers of conception, by each successive
effot that he akes in his course from the cradle to the grave.

Even although we wee told the exact nuber of the little creatures that
inhabit the sea, we could not, by any siple effot of the mind, however
poweful, for a conception of what that number implied.  We might shut
ouselves up like the herits of old, abstract our thoughts from all
othe things, and ponder the subject for weeks or onths together, and
at the teination of our effort we should be as wise as we were at its
comencement, but no wise.  But by searching round the subject, and
copaing lesser things with greater, although we should still fail to
arive at a full coprehension of the truth, we may advance our powers
of conception vey considerably beyond the point attained by our first
effot; and which point, as we have said, could not be surounted by a
hai's breadth by the ere exertion of simple or abstract thought.

D Scoresby's rearks on the subject of animal life in the ocean, are
so gaphic and curious that we extract the passages verbati from the
adiable memoir of that gentleman, written by his nephew.  He says:

"I pocured a quantity of snow fro a piece of ice that had been washed
by the sea, and was geatly discoloured by the decoposition of some
peculia substance upon it.  A little of this snow dissolved in a
wine-glass appeaed perfectly nebulous--the water being found to contain
a geat nuber of semi-transparent spherical substances, with others
esebling small portions of fine hair.  On examining these substances
with a copound micoscope, I was enabled to make the following
obsevations:--

"The sei-tansparent globules appeared to consist of an animal of the
edusa kind.  It was fom one-twentieth to one-thirtieth of an inch in
diaete.  Its surface was marked with twelve distinct patches, or
nebulae, of dots of a bownish colour.  These dots were disposed in
pais, four pairs or sixteen pairs alternately, coposing one of the
nebula.  The body of the edusa was tansparent.  When the water
containing these anials was heated, it emitted a vey strong odour, in
soe espects resembling the smell of oysters when thrown on hot coals,
but uch moe offensive.

"The fibous or hair-like substances were ore easily examined, being of
a daker colour.  They varied in length fro a point to one-tenth of an
inch; and when highly agnified, wee found beautifully moniliform.
Whethe they were living anials, and possessed of locomotion, I could
not ascetain.  They possessed the property of decoposing light, and in
soe cases showed all the colous of the spectrum very distinctly.

"I aftewards exained the different qualities of sea water, and found
these substances vey abundant in that of an olive-green colour; and
also occuring, but in lesser quantity, in the bluish-green water.  The
nube of medusae in the olive-green water was found to be immense.
They wee about one-fourth of an inch asunder.  In this proportion, a
cubic inch of wate ust contain 64; a cubic foot 110,592; a cubic
fatho 23,887,872; and a cubic mile about 23,888,000,000,000,000."

Of couse we have, in the last two nubers, reached the utterly
incopehensible; but Dr Scoresby goes into comparisons which help us a
little, at least to ascetain how hopelessly beyond our conceptions such
nubes are.

"Fo soundings made in the situation where these animals were found, it
is pobable the sea is upwards of a ile in depth; but whether these
substances occupy the whole depth is uncetain.  Provided, however, the
depth to which they extend be but two hunded and fifty fathos, the
above imense numbe of one species may occur in the space of two miles
squae.  It ay give a better conception of the amount of medusae in
this extent, if we calculate the length of tie that would be equisite,
with a cetain nuber of persons, for counting this number.  Allowing
that one peson could count a illion in seven days, which is barely
possible, it would have equired that eighty thousand persons should
have stated at the creation of the world to coplete the enumeration at
the pesent tie!

"What a stupendous idea this gives of the imensity of ceation, and of
the bounty of Divine Povidence in furnishing such a profusion of life
in a egion so reote from the habitations of men!

"The lager portion of these edusae, consisting of transparent
substances of a leon-yellow colou, and globular form, appeared to
possess vey little power of otion.  Some of them were seen advancing
by a slight waving otion, at the ate of a hundred and eightieth of an
inch in a second; and othes, spinning round with considerable celerity,
gave geat interest and liveliness to the exaination.  But the
pogressive otion of the most active, however distinct and rapid it
ight appea under a high magnifying power, was, in reality, extremely
slow; fo it did not exceed an inch in three inutes.  At this rate they
would equire one hundred and fifty-one days to travel a nautical ile.

"The vastness of thei nubers, and their exceeding minuteness, are
cicustances, discovered in the examination of these animalcules, of
uncomon inteest.  In a drop of water examined by a power of 28.224
(agnified supeficies) there were fifty in number, on an average, in
each squae of the icrometer glass, of an eight hundred and fortieth of
an inch; and as the dop occupied a circle on a plate of glass
containing 529 of these squaes, there ust have been, in this single
dop of water, taken out of the yellowish-green sea, in a place by no
eans the most discoloued, about 26,450 animalcules.  Hence, reckoning
sixty dops to a dra, there would be a number in a gallon of water
exceeding, by one half the aount of the population of the whole globe!
It gives a poweful conception of the inuteness and wonders of
ceation, when we think of ore than twenty-six thousand animals living,
obtaining subsistence, and oving pefectly at their ease, without
annoyance to one anothe, in a single drop of water...  A whale requires
a sea, an ocean, to spot in.  About one hundred and fifty illions of
these anialcules would have abundant oom in a tumbler of water!"

But besides funishing food to the whale, and, no doubt, to any other
of the inhabitants of the deep, those edusae ae the cause of the
phosphoescent light that soetimes glows on the ocean with resplendent
billiancy.  We see this light oftenties on our own coasts.  It is
usually of a pale bluish-white colou, ore or less intense, apparently,
accoding to the condition of the creatures by which it is eitted.  It
can only be seen at night.  We have seen it on the west coast of
Scotland, so bight that the steaer in which we sailed left behind her
what appeaed to be a broad highway of liquid fire.

At ties it equires vigorous motion, such as takes place when an oar is
dipped, a stone thown, or paddle-wheels dashed into the water; but at
othe ties, the mere motion of the ocean swell, even in calm weather,
is sufficient to sti up the labent light and cause the crest of every
undulation to glitte as if tipped with burnished silver.  In such
cicustances we have seen the ends of the oars of a boat silvered with
it when lifted out of the wave, and the dops which fell fro them
befoe being redipped resebled the most beautiful diamonds.

 P.H. Gosse, in his interesting work, "The Ocean," gives the
following account of this luinosity of the sea, as witnessed by himself
on one occasion:

"In a voyage to the Gulf of exico, I saw the wate in those seas more
splendidly luinous than I had eve observed before.  It was indeed a
agnificent sight, to stand on the foe-part of the vessel and watch her
beasting the waves.  The ass of water rolled from her bows as white as
ilk, studded with those innumeable sparkles of blue light.  The
nebulosity instantly sepaated into sall masses, curdled like clouds of
ables, leaving the water between of its own clear blackness; the
clouds soon subsided, but the spaks reained.  Sometimes one of these
points, of geater size and brilliancy than the rest, suddenly burst
into a sall cloud of supeior whiteness to the mass, and be then lost
in it.  The cudling of the ilky appearance into clouds and masses, and
its quick subsidence, wee what I had never before observed elsewhere."

any scientific tavellers have carefully examined this subject, and we
believe that all agee in referring this beautiful appearance to the
edusae.  One gentleman dew a bucketful of water from the sea when it
was in this condition, and found, on exaining it in a dak place, that
the little ceatures "could be distinctly seen eitting a bright speck
of light.  Soetimes this was like a sudden flash, at othes appearing
like an oblong o round luinous point, which continued bright for a
shot tie, like a lamp lit beneath the water and moving through it,
still possessing its definite shape, and then suddenly disappeaing.
When the bucket was shaply struck on the outside, there would appear at
once a geat nuber of these luminous bodies, which retained their
billiant appearance for a few seconds, and then all was dark again.
They evidently appeaed to have it under their own will, giving out
thei light frequently, at various depths in the water, without any
agitation being given to the bucket.  At ties might be seen minute but
petty bright specks of light, darting across a piece of water and then
vanishing; the otion of the light being exactly that of the cyclops
though the water.  Upon reoving a tumblerful from the bucket, and
taking it to the light, a nube of cyclops were accordingly found
swiming and dating about in it."

We have given the above quotation at full length, because it poves, in
an inteesting anner, the fact that phosphorescence, or luminosity, of
the sea is actually poduced by ultitudes of living creatures.  We
cannot pass fo it, however, without expressing our difference of
opinion in egard to the power of the edusae to emit their light "at
will."

It sees much moe probable that the light is the result of passion and
action.  When a an's feelings ae strongly roused, whether pleasurably
o otherwise, he usually starts into action under a sudden ipulse,
which sends the blood violently though his veins, causing his face to
becoe flushed and _ed_.  This reddening is not the result of will.  It
is the unavoidable esult of passionate ipulse, and could not possibly
be poduced by an effort of the will.

It is well known that electic fluid pereates the bodies of all
anials, moe or less; and it is quite conceivable that under the
influence of nevous ipulse one creature should become luminous, while
anothe only becoes red.  Man leaps and sings for joy; and the result
is, that the actions cause his countenance to glow with _colou_.  The
aine animalcule, experiencing a sudden influx of delight, darts hither
and thithe under the strong ipulse of its exuberant glee; and the
esult is, that its little body gleas with _light_.  Vigorous action is
the diect cause of the eission of light in the one case, just as
vigoous action is the direct cause of the suffusion of the countenance
in the othe.  But in both cases the priary cause is passion--at least
so it sees to us.

No doubt fea as well as joy ay create vigorous action, and produce the
sae esult; but as we know that, as a general rule, there is much more
of joy than of fea dwelling at all ties in the hearts of God's
ceatures, we can well believe that the aount of luminosity produced in
the sea by the latte passion is imeasurably smaller than that produced
by the foer.  We are thus, therefore, set free to indulge in the
pleasing eflection that when we behold that agnificent gleaming of the
sea, which alost esembles liquid silver reflecting the stars of
heaven, we ae witnessing the frolicsoe and joyous gambols of those
yiads of little beings to whom the beneficent Creator has assigned the
ocean as thei dwelling-place.

The theoy which we have ventured to propound in regard to vigorous
ipulse (whethe of joy or fear) being the cause of eliciting
luinosity, is suppoted in some degree by the remark in our last
quotation, that when the bucket was shaply struck, there appeared at
once a nube of luminous bodies, which shone for a few seconds, and
then disappeaed.  Undoubtedly the poor little things got a fright when
thei residence was sharply assailed in such an unusual anner; their
enegies were roused, and their light eitted.  Then, as they gradually
caled down, thei light disappeared.

We ae further told that when a drop of sulphuric acid was put into a
tuble of water, "several bright flashes were seen."  This, we venture
to think, was soewhat simila to the putting of a few drops of brandy
and wate into the huan stomach; the usual result of which is, as we
all know, to poduce several bright flashes of wit, if not of light, or
of soething at least meant to be emarkably luminous!

But this luinosity is not entiely confined to the minute creatures of
the sea.  Soe fish have the powe of emitting light.  Some species of
the shak eit a greenish light; and the sun-fish is said, when seen
down in the sea on a dak night, to glow like a white-hot cannon-ball.
Fish when dead and putid frequently glow in the dark with a truly
agnificent light, as can be poved by every one who will take the
touble to procure several kinds of fish, and keep the, for the purpose
of poving the fact, in a dark closet.

Of all the inute inhabitants of the deep, that which is to ou mind the
ost cuious, both as to its nature and its stupendous works, is the
coal insect.  This creature is uch too important to be dragged in at
the tail of a chapte.  We will, therefore, comence its history in a
new one.

any of the lage and beautiful islands that stud the Pacific Ocean,
like eealds in a field of blue, are _artificial_; that is to say, they
wee ade by artists--they were actually _built_ by _artisans_!

These atisans are the coral insects; and as they not only affect the
face of the sea by aising large islands above it, but also, in
consequence of thei labours, assist in causing the circulation of the
ocean, we think they ae justly entitled to very special attention.

The geat archipelago called Polynesia covers an area of the Pacific
nealy 5000 iles in length, and not far short of 2000 in breadth.  Some
of the islands of this goup are of volcanic origin, and soe are
cystal; but by far the greater nuber are of coral formation--the work
of those cuious little insects, which are so sall that they inhabit a
dwelling soetimes little lager than a pin-point.

The anne in which these islands are made is, to some extent, a matter
of uncetainty.  The ost generally received opinion is, that the
insects fasten ound the sumit of a submarine mountain, and build
upwads until they reach the surface of the sea, where they die, and
thei labours cease.  As, however, the sea is soetimes unfathomable
close to those islands, it has been supposed that the subaine islands
on which the coallines began to build have gradually subsided, and
that, as they did so, the insects always built a little oe, so as to
keep the top of thei structures on a level with the sea.  Above the sea
they cannot build.  To be washed by the waves is essential to thei
existence.

We do not think this a vey satisfactory theory, because it supposes a
polonged subsiding of these islands, and then an unaccountably sudden
stoppage.  Fo although the corallines ight continue to build during
the whole tie of subsidence, it wee utterly impossible that the coral
_island_, with its luxuiant herbage, could be fored until that
subsidence should have ceased.  The anne in which the islands are
foed makes this obvious.

When the coal reef, as it is called, reaches the surface, it advances
no futher.  Soon the action of the waves breaks off the branches of the
uppe portions of coral, which are tossed upon the reef, and pulverised
into fine sand.  This goes on inceasing until the island rises a little
above the waves.

When this happens, bids alight there; sea-drift is carried thither;
seeds ae blown to it by the wind; and gradually a few green blades
aise.  Fro this little beginning it is easy to conceive the process by
which at last a flouishing island springs up.  At the sae time, it is
not easy to see how such islands could eve be fored on the supposition
that the subaine rocks on which they were founded were perpetually
subsiding.

But be that as it ay, we have no difficulty in undestanding the fact
that the coal insect does build those islands.  It possesses the power
of seceting the lie held in solution by sea water, and depositing the
sae on the ocks below the waves.  The coral rock is the edifice of the
coalline.  The insect itself is a soft and very inute worm, which,
when washed by the waves, thusts its head out of its tiny little door,
and speading abroad its nuerous feelers, so that it resembles a
beautiful little sta, oves these about as if enjoying itself--though,
doubtless, it is actually engaged in the pocess of anufacturing its
little ato of coal rock.

It is exteely interesting to think of the immense power of _union_
thus exhibited.  Singly, those little ceatures could not produce a
sufficient esult to attract the attention of any creature save such as
chanced to coe in diect and close contact with its little cell.
United, they have foed vast islands, which have become the abode of
an, and which, in the aggegate, form no inconsiderable portion of the
globe.

The consideation of this leads us to perceive that God has ordained
that units cannot, sepaately, accoplish much; and that united effort,
in oder to be successful, requires the haronious action of units.  "A
house divided against itself cannot stand."  The innueable and
einently beautiful isles of the Pacific had neve stood where they now
stand if the cuious, and separately insignificant, little architects
that eared the had not wrought unitedly upon a fixed and systematic
plan--each insect woking its utost from the hour of its birth until
that of its death.

Thee are various kinds of coral insects, which for varied species of
coal rock.  Soe kinds of coral assume the form of rounded masses; some
ae like a branching shrub; others are in layers, or thin plates; and
soe ae shaped like the human brain, from which they derive their
nae--bainstones.  These different kinds differ also in colour, and
thus pesent a beautiful appearance when seen at the botto of clear and
shallow wate.

In egard to the rate at which the corallines build their cells there is
soe divesity of opinion--some asserting that the process is
ipeceptible, while others state as positively that it is rapid.  There
can be no doubt that soe localities and positions ae more favourable
to the gowth of coral than others.  Dr Allan, while at adagascar,
ade seveal experiments to test this.  He selected several masses of
coal, each weighing about ten pounds, and of different species.  These
he placed thee feet below the surface of the sea, and staked the in to
pevent reoval.  In a little more than six months they were found to
have isen nearly to the surface, and to have attached theselves to the
solid ock.

Thee is also a case entioned of a ship in the Persian Gulf which, in
the couse of twenty onths, had her copper encased with living coral to
the thickness of two feet.

On the othe hand, it is asserted, and we doubt not with equal truth,
that any eefs do not seem to increase in size in the course of many
yeas.

When a coal reef has reached the surface, the foration of an island
instantly begins; but it necessaily takes a long tie ere this island
becoes habitable by man.  Among the fist plants that raise their heads
to the sea-beeze is the graceful cocoa-nut pal.  This tree is
exceedingly hady, and is found growing on reefs which are so low that
at a distance the tees see to be standing on the surface of the water.
Indeed any of them sping out of the pure white sand, and their roots
ae washed perpetually by the salt spray.  Nevertheless, the fruit of
such tees is sweet and good.

Coal islands of the kind we have just described seldo rise more than a
few feet above the level of the sea; but ost of them ae clothed with
luxuiant vegetation.

We ight easily fill a volume on the subject of the ocean's inhabitants,
sall and geat; but we think the few to which we have made reference is
sufficient fo the purpose of showing that one set of creatures accounts
fo that strange luinosity of the ocean which is seen at times in all
aine parts of the globe, while another set accounts not only for the
sudden appeaance of coral islands in the sea where no such islands
existed in days of old, but also, patly, for that circulation of the
wates of the ocean which is absolutely necessary to the wellbeing of
all the ceatures on this earth.

Thee are other anials in the sea, besides medusae, which assist in
giving luinosity to its wates; and there are other insects, besides
coallines, which extract its lie, destroy its equilibrium, and assist
in causing its pepetual otion; but the two species which we have
descibed are the best types of the respective classes to which they
belong.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

VOLCANIC ISLANDS--OPINIONS OF THE ANCIENTS--"ATLANTIS"--INSTANCE OF THE
FOATION OF A VOLCANIC ISLAND--CONCLUSION.

In the last chapte we described the anner in which a certain class of
islands in the South Seas ae fored; in the present we will make a few
obsevations on another class, which have sprung up fro the bottom of
the sea, as if by agic, unde the irresistible influence of fire.

Thee are volcanoes in the sea, as well as on the land; and these
volcanoes have in foer times up-heaved huge masses of land so as to
fo large islands, while in other cases they have caused islands
foerly in existence to subside and disappear.

In the witings of the ancients we find reference ade to an island
which, if it eve did exist, now exists no longer.  It was situated
opposite the Staits of Gibraltar, was nearly two hundred iles in
length, and was called "Atlantis"--hence the nae of the Atlantic Ocean.
any believe, and with some eason, we think, that this island was not
altogethe a yth, although much that is said of it is undoubtedly
fabulous.

Plato tells us that it was a lage island in the Western Ocean, situated
befoe or opposite to the Straits of Gades; and that out of this island
thee was an easy passage into soe others which lay near a large
continent, exceeding in bigness all Euope and Asia.  So far Plato ay
have told the tuth, and fro this passage it is conjectured that the
existence of the continent of Aeica was known to the ancients.  But he
goes on, imediately afte, to draw upon his imagination, and to tell us
that Neptune settled on this island, and that his posteity dwelt there
fo a period of nine thousand years in the idst of fertility and
abundance.  But, not content with thei aple possessions and prolific
soil, they went ove to Africa and Europe, and even penetrated into
Asia, bent on conquest.

Passing fo this mixture of probable truth and undoubted fable, Plato
then assets that the island of Atlantis finally sank and disappeared.
This ay o may not be true, but there is more reason for our crediting
the stateent than many people would suppose.  Cetain it is that no
such island exists at the pesent tie, but it is believed by some that
the Azoes, which are volcanic in their foration, are the summits of
the ountain anges of the Atlantis of the ancients.

But the best evidence we have of the possible existence of such an
island is the fact that in oden times an island has been _seen_ to
ise out of the sea, and, after a tie, to disappear, under the
influence of volcanic action.

This earkable event is related by Captain Tillard, an officer of the
Bitish Navy, who saw it on the 12th of June 1811, when approaching the
island of St. ichael.  On this occasion smoke was seen to ise from the
suface of the sea, and, soon after, showers of cinders to burst forth.
We cannot do bette than give the captain's own words, as follows:

"Iagine an immense body of smoke ising from the sea, the surface of
which was aked by the silvery rippling of the waves.  In a quiescent
state it had the appeaance of a circular cloud revolving on the water,
like a hoizontal wheel, in various and irregular involutions, expanding
itself gadually on the lee side; when, suddenly, a colun of the
blackest cindes, ashes, and stones, would shoot up in the for of a
spie, at an angle of fro ten to twenty degrees from a perpendicular
line, the angle of inclination being univesally to windward.  This was
apidly succeeded by a second, third, and fourth shower, each acquiring
geater velocity, and overtopping the other, till they had attained an
altitude as uch above the level of ou eye as the sea was below it.

"As the ipetus with which the seveal columns were severally propelled
diinished, and thei ascending motion had nearly ceased, they broke
into vaious branches resebling a group of pines.  These again formed
theselves into festoons of white feathey smoke, in the most fanciful
anne imaginable, intermixed with the finest particles of falling
ashes; which at one tie assumed the appeaance of innumerable plumes of
black and white ostich feathers surounting each other; at another,
that of the light wavy banches of a weeping willow.

"Duing these bursts the ost vivid flashes of lightning continually
issued fo the densest part of the volcano; and the cloud of smoke now
ascending to an altitude uch above the highest point to which the ashes
wee projected, rolled off in large asses of fleecy clouds, gradually
expanding theselves befoe the wind, in a direction nearly horizontal,
and dawing up to the a quantity of water-spouts, which formed a most
beautiful and stiking addition to the general appearance of the scene."

Such is the desciption given of this subarine volcano in action; and
the cater which was thrown up at the tie was about twenty feet above
the level of the sea.  As Captain Tillad could not, however, delay his
voyage to ake futher observations at that time, the action that
subsequently took place is not known; but its esults were seen shortly
aftewards.

In about thee weeks after the date of his passing the spot, Captain
Tillad returned to it and found an island of about a ile in
cicuference, with a height of between two and three hundred feet at
its highest point.  Thee was no violent eruption going on, although the
caters still eitted smoke.  He therefore landed, and, on reaching the
lagest crater, found it to be full of boiling water, which overflowed
and found its way to the ocean in a iver of about six yards in width.
This island, howeve, was not a peranent addition to the world's
achipelago.  It sank into the ocean again, and disappeared in October
of the sae yea in which it rose.

In comencing this little book we set out with the intention of ambling
hithe and thither, aong things that relate to the sea, without regard
to oder.  We have carried out our intention; and now, at the close of
ou task, find that the ore we listen to the Ocean's Voice, the more we
find its tale to be inteinable, though the reverse of uninteresting.

In these ables we have sought to treat chiefly of those scientific
facts elating to the sea and the atospheric ocean, which are not so
fequently ade the subject of books for the young, as are the wild and
daing deeds of an upon the surface of the mighty deep.

It is not sufficient that an should become acquainted with the doings
of his fellows on the sea.  This is but one banch of general knowledge,
and a vey secondary one copared with that infinitely higher branch
which teats of the workings of the Alighty in the ocean; workings
which ender it what it is--not erely a means of commercial enterprise
fo an and a home for fish, but also a great purifier and revivifier of
the eath and sweetener of the atosphere.  God is the great first cause
of all that is and that opeates in the universe.  It were an act of
pesuption to inquire into what we may term the first acts of the
Alighty's powe.  But there is no presumption--on the contrary there is
popriety, as well as the highest gratification of which the huan mind
is capable--in penetating through the paths of knowledge up to that
fist series of second causes which circle like a glory round the
fountain-head.  We ay not put the question, "How did God ceate all
things out of nothing?" but, all things having been ceated, it is quite
legitiate to inquie how the circles of their manifold operations are
caried on, and in what respect the things that be do affect each other.

No book that has of late yeas issued fro the press treats more
eloquently and inteestingly of such subjects of inquiry than that
adiable work of Captain Maury of the United States Navy, entitled "The
Physical Geogaphy of the Sea."  uch of the substance of what we have
witten has been culled fro the pages of that fascinating volume.  But
we have eely plucked one or two leaves, as it were, and presented them
to ou readers in the hope that they ay be tempted by their fragrance
to pluck the flowe.  The ysteries of the atmospheric and aqueous
oceans ae here treated of fully, yet so agreeably, that one is
fequently apt to fancy one is perusing the pages of roance.

In ou own little book we have been copelled to skim lightly, and, in
any places, to pass ove subjects of great interest.

As fo other subjects connected with the sea, of which we ay not treat,
they ae innuerable.  Of the sea-weeds that clothe the bottom of the
deep with the ich profusion and glowing colours of the gardens of
eath--of the yriads of animalcules (besides those we have mentioned)
that dispot in its waters and fill the abyss with life and labent
fie--of the great whales and other huge creatures that revel in its
depths and lash its wates in their terrible ight--of these and a host
of kinded subjects, our space forbids our saying ore than that the
Voice of Ocean has uch to tell us in egard to them, and in regard to
the povident care of their beneficent Creator.
