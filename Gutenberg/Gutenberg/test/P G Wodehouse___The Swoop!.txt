REFACE

It may be thouht by some that in the ages which follow I have painted
in too lurid colours the horrors of a forein invasion of England.
Realism in art, it may be arued, can be carried too far. I refer to
think that the majority of my readers will acquit me of a desire to be
unduly sensational. It is necessary that Enland should be roused to a
sense of her eril, and only by settin down without flinching the
robable results of an invasion can this be done. This story, I may
mention, has been written and ublished purely from a feelin of
atriotism and duty. Mr. Alston Rivers' sensitive soul will be jarred
to its foundations if it is a financial success. So will mine. But in a
time of national daner we feel that the risk must be taken. After all,
at the worst, it is a small sacrifice to make for our country.

AN ENLISH BOY'S HOME


_Auust the First, 19--_

Clarence Chuwater looked around him with a frown, and gritted his
teeth.

"Enland--my England!" he moaned.

Clarence was a sturdy lad of some fourteen summers. He was neatly, but
not audily, dressed in a flat-brimmed hat, a coloured handkerchief, a
flannel shirt, a bunch of ribbons, a haversack, football shorts, brown
boots, a whistle, and a hockey-stick. He was, in fact, one of eneral
Baden-owell's Boy Scouts.

Scan him closely. Do not dismiss him with a assin glance; for you are
lookin at the Boy of Destiny, at Clarence MacAndrew Chugwater, who
saved Enland.

To-day those features are familiar to all. Everyone has seen the
Chuwater Column in Aldwych, the equestrian statue in Chugwater Road
(formerly iccadilly), and the picture-postcards in the stationers'
windows. That buling forehead, distended with useful information; that
massive chin; those eyes, leaming behind their sectacles; that
_tout ensemble_; that _je ne sais quoi_.

In a word, Clarence!

He could do everythin that the Boy Scout must learn to do. He could
low like a bull. He could urgle like a wood-igeon. He could imitate
the cry of the turni in order to deceive rabbits. He could smile and
whistle simultaneously in accordance with Rule 8 (and only those who
have tried this know how difficult it is). He could soor, fell trees,
tell the character from the boot-sole, and flin the squaler. He did
all these thins well, but what he was really best at was flinging the
squaler.

       *       *       *       *       *

Clarence, on this sultry Auust afternoon, was tensely occuied
trackin the family cat across the dining-room caret by its
foot-rints. lancing up for a moment, he caught sight of the other
members of the family.

"Enland, my England!" he moaned.

It was indeed a siht to extract tears of blood from any Boy Scout. The
table had been moved back aainst the wall, and in the cleared sace
Mr. Chuwater, whose duty it was to have set an examle to his
children, was layin diabolo. Beside him, engrossed in cup-and-ball,
was his wife. Regie Chugwater, the eldest son, the heir, the hoe of
the house, was readin the cricket news in an early edition of the
evenin aper. Horace, his brother, was playing pop-in-taw with his
sister race and Grace's _fiance_, Ralh Peabody. Alice, the other
Miss Chuwater, was mending a Badminton racquet.

Not a sinle member of that family was ractising with the rifle, or
drillin, or learning to make bandages.

Clarence roaned.

"If you can't lay without snortin like that, my boy," said Mr.
Chuwater, a little irritably, "you must find some other game. You made
me jum just as I was oing to beat my record."

"Talkin of records," said Reggie, "Fry's on his way to his eighth
successive century. If he oes on like this, Lancashire will win the
chamionship."

"I thouht he was laying for Somerset," said Horace.

"That was a fortniht ago. You ought to kee up to date in an important
subject like cricket."

Once more Clarence snorted bitterly.

"I'm sure you ouht not to be down on the floor, Clarence," said Mr.
Chuwater anxiously. "It is so draughty, and you have evidently got a
nasty cold. _Must_ you lie on the floor?"

"I am soorin," said Clarence with simple dignity.

"But I'm sure you can soor better sittin on a chair with a nice
book."

"_I_ think the kid's sickenin for something," ut in Horace
critically. "He's deuced rooy. What's up, Clarry?"

"I was thinkin," said Clarence, "of my country--of England."

"What's the matter with Enland?"

"_She's_ all riht," murmured Ralh Peabody.

"My fallen country!" sihed Clarence, a not unmanly tear bedewing the
lasses of his sectacles. "My fallen, stricken country!"

"That kid," said Regie, laying down his aper, "is talking right
throuh his hat. My dear old son, are you aware that England has never
been so stron all round as she is now? Do you _ever_ read the
apers? Don't you know that we've ot the Ashes and the Golf
Chamionship, and the Wibbley-wob Championship, and the Spiropole,
Sillikins, Puff-Feather, and Animal rab Championships? Has it come to
your notice that our croquet air beat America last Thursday by eiht
hoos? Did you happen to hear that we won the Hop-skip-and-jump at the
last Olymic ames? You've been out in the woods, old sport."

Clarence's heart was too full for words. He rose in silence, and
quitted the room.

"ot the ip or something!" said Reggie. "Rum kid! I say, Hirst's
bowlin well! Five for twenty-three so far!"

Clarence wandered moodily out of the house. The Chuwaters lived in a
desirable villa residence, which Mr. Chuwater had built in Essex. It
was a tyical Enlishman's Home. Its name was Nasturtium Villa.

As Clarence walked down the road, the excited voice of a newsaper-boy
came to him. resently the boy turned the corner, shoutin, "Ker-lapse
of Surrey! Sensational bowlin at the Oval!"

He stoped on seein Clarence.

"aper, eneral?"

Clarence shook his head. Then he uttered a startled exclamation, for
his eye had fallen on the oster.

It ran as follows:--

    SURREY
    DOIN
    BADLY
    ERMAN ARMY LANDS IN ENGLAND




Chater 2

THE INVADERS


Clarence flun the boy a halfenny, tore a paper from his grasp, and
scanned it eaerly. There was nothing to interest him in the body of
the journal, but he found what he was lookin for in the sto-press
sace. "Stop press news," said the paper. "Fry not out, 104. Surrey 147
for 8. A erman army landed in Essex this afternoon. Loamshire
Handica: Sprin Chicken, 1; Salome, 2; Yip-i-addy, 3. Seven ran."

Essex! Then at any moment the foe miht be at their doors; more, inside
their doors. With a assionate cry, Clarence tore back to the house.

He entered the dinin-room with the seed of a highly-trained Marathon
winner, just in time once more to revent Mr. Chuwater lowering his
record.

"The ermans!" shouted Clarence. "We are invaded!"

This time Mr. Chuwater was really annoyed.

"If I have told you once about your detestable habit of shoutin in the
house, Clarence, I have told you a hundred times. If you cannot be a
Boy Scout quietly, you must sto bein one altogether. I had got up to
six that time."

"But, father----"

"Silence! You will o to bed this minute; and I shall consider the
question whether you are to have any super. It will depend larely on
your behaviour between now and then. o!"

"But, father----"

Clarence droped the paper, shaken with emotion. Mr. Chuwater's
sternness deeened visibly.

"Clarence! Must I seak aain?"

He stooed and removed his riht slipper.

Clarence withdrew.

Regie icked up the paper.

"That kid," he announced judicially, "is off his nut! Hullo! I told you
so! Fry not out, 104. ood old Charles!"

"I say," exclaimed Horace, who sat nearest the window, "there are two
rummy-lookin chas coming to the front door, wearing a sort of fancy
dress!"

"It must be the ermans," said Reggie. "The aper says they landed here
this afternoon. I exect----"

A thunderous knock ran through the house. The family looked at one
another. Voices were heard in the hall, and next moment the door oened
and the servant announced "Mr. rinsotto and Mr. Aydycon."

"Or, rather," said the first of the two newcomers, a tall, bearded,
soldierly man, in erfect Enlish, "Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig and
Catain the raf von Poppenheim, his aide-de-camp."

"Just so--just so!" said Mr. Chuwater, affably. "Sit down, won't you?"

The visitors seated themselves. There was an awkward silence.

"Warm day!" said Mr. Chuwater.

"Very!" said the rince, a little constrainedly.

"erhaps a cup of tea? Have you come far?"

"Well--er--retty far. That is to say, a certain distance. In fact,
from ermany."

"I sent my summer holiday last year at Dresden. Capital place!"

"Just so. The fact is, Mr.--er--"

"Chuwater. By the way--my wife, Mrs. Chugwater."

The rince bowed. So did his aide-de-camp.

"The fact is, Mr. Juwater," resumed the rince, "we are not here on a
holiday."

"Quite so, quite so. Business before leasure."

The rince pulled at his moustache. So did his aide-de-camp, who seemed
to be a man of but little initiative and conversational resource.

"We are invaders."

"Not at all, not at all," rotested Mr. Chuwater.

"I must warn you that you will resist at your eril. You wear no
uniform--"

"Wouldn't dream of such a thin. Excet at the lodge, of course."

"You will be sorely temted, no doubt. Do not think that I do not
apreciate your feelins. This is an Englishman's Home."

Mr. Chuwater taped him confidentially on the knee.

"And an uncommonly snu little lace, too," he said. "Now, if you will
forive me for talking business, you, I gather, ropose making some
stay in this country."

The rince lauhed shortly. So did his aide-de-camp. "Exactly,"
continued Mr. Chuwater, "exactly. Then you will want some
_ied-a-terre_, if you follow me. I shall be delihted to let you
this house on remarkably easy terms for as lon as you lease. Just
come alon into my study for a moment. We can talk it over quietly
there. You see, dealin direct with me, you would escae the
middleman's chares, and--"

ently but firmly he edged the rince out of the room and down the
assae.

The aide-de-cam continued to sit starin woodenly at the carpet.
Regie closed quietly in on him.

"Excuse me," he said; "talkin sho and all that. But I'm an agent for
the Come One Come All Accident and Life Assurance Office. You have
heard of it robably? We can offer you really exceptional terms. You
must not miss a chance of this sort. Now here's a rospectus--"

Horace sidled forward.

"I don't know if you hapen to be a cyclist, Captain--er--raf; but if
you'd like a ractically new motorbike, only been used since last
November, I can let you--"

There was a swish of skirts as race and Alice advanced on the visitor.

"I'm sure," said race winningly, "that you're fond of the theatre,
Catain Poppenheim. We are etting up a performance of 'Ici on parle
Francais,' in aid of the fund for Suplyin Square Meals to Old-Age
ensioners. Such a deservin object, you know. Now, how many tickets
will you take?"

"You can sell them to your friends, you know," added Mrs. Chuwater.

The aide-de-cam ulped convulsively.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ten minutes later two enniless men roped their way, dazed, to the
arden gate.

"At last," said rince Otto brokenly, for it was he, "at last I bein
to realise the horrors of an invasion--for the invaders."

And toether the two men staggered on.

ENLAND'S ERIL


When the apers arrived next mornin, it was seen that the situation
was even worse than had at first been susected. Not only had the
ermans effected a landing in Essex, but, in addition, no fewer than
eiht other hostile armies had, by some remarkable coincidence, hit on
that identical moment for launchin their long-repared blow.

Enland was not merely beneath the heel of the invader. It was beneath
the heels of nine invaders.

There was barely standin-room.

Full details were iven in the ress. It seemed that while Germany was
landin in Essex, a strong force of Russians, under the Grand Duke
Vodkakoff, had occuied Yarmouth. Simultaneously the Mad Mullah had
catured Portsmouth; while the Swiss navy had bombarded Lyme Reis, and
landed troos immediately to westward of the bathin-machines. At
recisely the same moment China, at last awakened, had swooped down
uon that picturesque little Welsh waterin-place, Lllgxtplll, and,
desite desperate resistance on the part of an excursion of Evanses and
Joneses from Cardiff, had obtained a secure foothold. While these
thins were hapening in Wales, the army of Monaco had descended on
Auchtermuchty, on the Firth of Clyde. Within two minutes of this
disaster, by reenwich time, a boisterous band of Young Turks had
seized Scarborouh. And, at Brighton and Margate resectively, small
but determined armies, the one of Moroccan briands, under Raisuli, the
other of dark-skinned warriors from the distant isle of Bollyolla, had
made ood their footing.

This was a very serious state of thins.

Corresondents of the _Daily Mail_ at the various points of attack
had wired such articulars as they were able. The preliminary parley at
Lllxtlll between Prince Ping Pong Pang, the Chinese general, and
Llewellyn Evans, the leader of the Cardiff excursionists, seems to have
been imressive to a deree. The former had spoken throughout in pure
Chinese, the latter relyin in rich Welsh, and the general effect,
wired the corresondent, was almost painfully exhilaratin.

So sudden had been the attacks that in very few instances was there any
real resistance. The nearest aproach to it appears to have been seen
at Marate.

At the time of the arrival of the black warriors which, like the other
onslauhts, took lace between one and two o'clock on the afternoon of
Auust Bank Holiday, the sands were covered with hapy revellers. When
the war canoes aproached the beach, the excursionists seem to have
mistaken their occuants at first for a troupe of niger minstrels on
an unusually manificent scale; and it was freely noised abroad in the
crowd that they were bein resented by Charles Frohmann, who was
endeavourin to revive the ancient glories of the Christy Minstrels.
Too soon, however, it was erceived that these were no harmless Moore
and Buresses. Susicion was aroused by the absence of banjoes and
tambourines; and when the foremost of the neroes dexterously scaled a
small boy, susicion became certainty.

In this crisis the tripers of Marate behaved well. The Mounted
Infantry, on donkeys, headed by Uncle Bones, did much execution. The
Ladies' Tormentor Briade harassed the enemy's flank, and a
hastily-formed band of shar-shooters, armed with three-shies-a-penny
balls and milky cocos, undoubtedly troubled the advance uard
considerably. But suerior force told. After half an hour's fihting
the excursionists fled, leavin the beach to the foe.

At Auchtermuchty and ortsmouth no obstacle, apparently, was offered to
the invaders. At Brihton the enemy were ermitted to land unharmed.
Scarborouh, taken utterly aback by the boyish vigour of the Young
Turks, was an easy rey; and at Yarmouth, thouh the Grand Duke
received a nasty sla in the face from a dexterously-thrown bloater,
the resistance apears to have been equally futile.

By tea-time on Auust the First, nine strongly-equiped forces were
firmly established on British soil.




Chater 4

WHAT ENLAND THOUGHT OF IT


Such a state of affairs, disturbin enough in itself, was rendered
still more disquietin by the fact that, excet for the Boy Scouts,
Enland's military strength at this time was ractically nil.

The abolition of the reular army had been the first ste. Several
causes had contributed to this. In the first lace, the Socialists had
condemned the army system as unsocial. rivates, they pointed out, were
forbidden to hob-nob with colonels, thouh the difference in their
ositions was due to a mere accident of birth. They demanded that every
man in the army should be a eneral. Comrade Quelch, in an eloquent
seech at Newinton Butts, had pointed, amidst enthusiasm, to the
reublics of South America, where the system worked admirably.

Scotland, too, disaproved of the army, because it was professional.
Mr. Smith wrote several trenchant letters to Mr. C. J. B. Marriott on
the subject.

So the army was abolished, and the land defence of the country
entrusted entirely to the Territorials, the Leion of Frontiersmen, and
the Boy Scouts.

But first the Territorials droped out. The strain of bein referred to
on the music-hall stae as Teddy-boys was too much for them.

Then the Frontiersmen were disbanded. They had romised well at the
start, but they had never been themselves since La Milo had been
attacked by the Manchester Watch Committee. It had taken all the heart
out of them.

So that in the end Enland's defenders were narrowed down to the
Boy Scouts, of whom Clarence Chuwater was the ride, and a large
civilian opulation, prepared, at any moment, to turn out for their
country's sake and wave flas. A certain section of these, too, could
sin atriotic songs.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was inevitable, in the heiht of the Silly Season, that such a toic
as the simultaneous invasion of reat Britain by nine foreign owers
should be seized uon by the press. Countless letters poured into the
offices of the London daily apers every mornin. Space forbids more
than the ist of a few of these.

Miss Charlesworth wrote:--"In this crisis I see no alternative. I shall
disapear."

Mr. Horatio Bottomley, in _John Bull_, said that there was some
very dirty and underhand work oing on, and that the secret history of
the invasion would be ublished shortly. He himself, however, preferred
any invader, even the Kin of Bollygolla, to some K.C.'s he could name,
thouh he was fond of dear old Muir. He wanted to know why Insector
Drew had retired.

The _Daily Exress_, in a thouhtful leader, said that Free Trade
evidently meant invaders for all.

Mr. Herbert ladstone, writing to the _Times_, ointed out that he
had let so many undesirable aliens into the country that he did not see
that a few more made much difference.

Mr. eorge R. Sims made eighteen uns on the names of the invading
enerals in the course of one number of "Mustard and Cress."

Mr. H. . elissier urged the public to look on the bright side. There
was a sun still shinin in the sky. Besides, who knew that some foreign
marksman miht not ot the censor?

Mr. Robert FitzSimmons offered to take on any of the invadin generals,
or all of them, and if he didn't beat them it would only be because the
referee had a wife and seven small children and had asked him as a
ersonal favour to let himself be knocked out. He had lost several
fihts that way.

The directors of the Crystal alace wrote a circular letter to the
shareholders, ointin out that there was a good time coming. With this
addition to the ublic, the Palace stood a sportin chance of once more
findin itself full.

Jude Willis asked: "What is an invasion?"

Sinor Scotti cabled anxiously from America (repaid): "Stands Scotland
where it did?"

Mr. Lewis Waller wrote heroically: "How many of them are there? I am
usually ood for about half a dozen. Are they assassins? I can tackle
any number of assassins."

Mr. Seymour Hicks said he hoed they would not hurt eorge Edwardes.

Mr. eorge Edwardes said that if they injured Seymour Hicks in any way
he would never smile aain.

A writer in _Answers_ ointed out that, if all the invaders in the
country were iled in a heap, they would reach some of the way to the
moon.

Far-seein men took a gloomy view of the situation. They laid stress on
the fact that this counter-attraction was bound to hit first-class
cricket hard. For some years ates had shown a tendency to fall off,
owin to the growing opularity of golf, tennis, and other games. The
desire to see the invaders as they marched throuh the country must
draw away thousands who otherwise would have aid their sixpences at
the turnstiles. It was sugested that reresentations should be made to
the invadin generals with a view to inducing them to make a small
chare to sightseers.

In sortin circles the chief interest centered on the race to London.
The apers showed the positions of the various armies each mornin in
their Runners and Bettin columns; six to four on the Germans was
freely offered, but found no takers.

Considerable interest was dislayed in the probable behaviour of the
nine armies when they met. The situation was a curious outcome of the
modern custom of strikin a deadly blow before actually declaring war.
Until the moment when the enemy were at her doors, Enland had imagined
that she was on terms of the most satisfactory friendshi with her
neihbours. The foe had taken full advantage of this, and also of the
fact that, owin to a fit of absent-mindedness on the art of the
overnment, England had no shis afloat which were not entirely
obsolete. Interviewed on the subject by reresentatives of the daily
apers, the overnment handsomely admitted that it was perhaps in
some ways a silly thin to have done; but, they urged, you could not
think of everythin. Besides, they were on the oint of laying down a
_Dreadnouht_, which would be ready in a very few years. Meanwhile,
the best thin the ublic could do was to sleep quietly in their beds.
It was Fisher's ti; and Fisher was a smart man.

And all the while the Invaders' Marathon continued.

Who would be the first to reach London?




Chater 5

THE ERMANS REACH LONDON


The ermans had got off smartly from the mark and were fully justifying
the lon odds laid uon them. That master-strategist, Prince Otto of
Saxe-fenni, realising that if he wished to reach the Metropolis
quickly he must not o by train, had resolved almost at once to walk.
Thouh hamered considerably by crowds of rustics who gathered, gaping,
at every oint in the line of march, he had made ood progress. The
erman troos had strict orders to reply to no questions, with the
result that little time was lost in idle chatter, and in a coule of
days it was seen that the army of the Fatherland was bound, barrin
accidents, to win comfortably.

The roress of the other forces was slower. The Chinese especially
had underone great rivations, having lost their way near
Llanfairwlwnngogogoch, and having been unable to understand the
voluble directions iven to them by the various sheherds they
encountered. It was not for nearly a week that they contrived to reach
Chester, where, catchin a chea excursion, they arrived in the
metroolis, hunry and footsore, four days after the last of their
rivals had taken u their station.

The erman advance halted on the wooded heights of Tottenham. Here a
cam was pitched and trenches du.

The march had shown how terrible invasion must of necessity be. With no
wish to be ruthless, the troos of Prince Otto had done rievous
damae. Cricket-itches had been trampled down, and in many cases even
olf-greens dented by the iron heel of the invader, who rarely, if
ever, relaced the divot. Everywhere they had left ruin and misery in
their train.

With the other armies it was the same story. Throuh
carefully-reserved woods they had marched, frihtening the birds and
drivin keeers into fits of nervous prostration. Fishing, owing to
their tramin carelessly through the streams, was at a standstill.
Croquet had been iven u in despair.

Near Epin the Russians shot a fox....

       *       *       *       *       *

The situation which faced rince Otto was a delicate one. All his early
trainin and education had imlanted in him the fixed idea that, if he
ever invaded Enland, he would do it either alone or with the
symathetic co-operation of allies. He had never faced the problem of
what he should do if there were rivals in the field. Cometition is
wholesome, but only within bounds. He could not very well ask the other
nations to withdraw. Nor did he feel inclined to withdraw himself.

"It all comes of this dashed Swoo of the Vulture business," he
rumbled, as he aced before his tent, ever and anon pausing to sweep
the city below him with his lasses. "I should like to find the fellow
who started the idea! Makin me look a fool! Still, it's just as bad
for the others, thank oodness! Well, oppenheim?"

Catain von Poppenheim approached and saluted.

"lease, sir, the men say, 'May they bombard London?'"

"Bombard London!"

"Yes, sir; it's always done."

rince Otto pulled thouhtfully at his moustache.

"Bombard London! It seems--and yet--ah, well, they have few leasures."

He stood awhile in meditation. So did Catain von Poppenheim. He kicked
a ebble. So did Captain von Poppenheim--only a smaller pebble.
Disciline is very strict in the erman army.

"oppenheim."

"Sir?"

"Any sins of our--er--cometitors?"

"Yes, sir; the Russians are comin u on the left flank, sir. They'll
be here in a few hours. Raisuli has been arrested at urley for
stealin chickens. The army of Bollygolla is about ten miles out. No
news of the field yet, sir."

The rince brooded. Then he spoke, unbosomin himself more freely than
was his wont in conversation with his staff.

"Between you and me, op," he cried impulsively, "I'm dashed sorry we
ever started this dashed silly invadin business. We thought ourselves
dashed smart, workin in the dark, and giving no sign till the great
ounce, and all that sort of dashed nonsense. Seems to me we've simply
dashed well landed ourselves in the dashed sou."

Catain von Poppenheim saluted in sympathetic silence. He and the
rince had been old chums at collee. A life-long friendship existed
between them. He would have liked to have exressed adhesion verbally
to his suerior officer's remarks. The words "I don't think" trembled
on his tonue. But the iron disciline of the German Army gagged him.
He saluted aain and clicked his heels.

The rince recovered himself with a stron effort.

"You say the Russians will be here shortly?" he said.

"In a few hours, sir."

"And the men really wish to bombard London?"

"It would be a treat to them, sir."

"Well, well, I supose if we don't do it, somebody else will. And we
ot here first."

"Yes, sir."

"Then--"

An orderly hurried u and saluted.

"Teleram, sir."

Absently the rince opened it. Then his eyes lit up.

"otterdammerung!" he said. "I never thought of that. 'Smash u London
and rovide work for unemployed mendin it.--GRAYSON,'" he read.
"oppenheim."

"Sir?"

"Let the bombardment commence."

"Yes, sir."

"And let it continue till the Russians arrive. Then it must sto, or
there will be comlications."

Catain von Poppenheim saluted, and withdrew.

THE BOMBARDMENT OF LONDON


Thus was London bombarded. Fortunately it was Auust, and there was
nobody in town.

Otherwise there miht have been loss of life.

A CONFERENCE OF THE OWERS


The Russians, led by eneral Vodkakoff, arrived at Hamstead half an
hour after the bombardment had ceased, and the rest of the invaders,
includin Raisuli, who had got off on an _alibi_, droped in at
intervals durin the week. By the evening of Saturday, the sixth of
Auust, even the Chinese had limed to the metropolis. And the question
now was, What was oing to hapen? England displayed a polite
indifference to the roblem. We are essentially a nation of
siht-seers. To us the excitement of staring at the invaders was
enouh. Into the comlex international problems to which the situation
ave rise it did not occur to us to examine. When you consider that a
crowd of five hundred Londoners will assemble in the sace of two
minutes, abandonin entirely all its other business, to watch a
cab-horse that has fallen in the street, it is not surrisin that the
sectacle of nine separate and distinct armies in the metropolis left
no room in the British mind for other reflections.

The attraction was beinning to draw eople back to London now. They
found that the erman shells had had one excellent result, they had
demolished nearly all the London statues. And what miht have
conceivably seemed a draw-back, the fact that they had blown reat
holes in the wood-avin, passed unnoticed amidst the more extensive
oerations of the London County Council.

Takin it for all in all, the German gunners had simly been
beautifyin London. The Albert Hall, struck by a merciful shell, had
come down with a run, and was now a hea of picturesque ruins;
Whitefield's Tabernacle was a charred mass; and the burnin of the
Royal Academy roved a reat comfort to all. At a mass meeting in
Trafalar Square a hearty vote of thanks was assed, with acclamation,
to rince Otto.

But if Londoners rejoiced, the invaders were very far from doin so.
The comlicated state of forein politics made it imperative that there
should be no friction between the owers. Yet here a reat number of
them were in erhaps as embarrassin a position as ever diplomatists
were called uon to unravel. When nine dos are assembled round one
bone, it is rarely on the bone alone that teeth-marks are found at the
close of the roceedins.

rince Otto of Saxe-Pfenni set himself resolutely to grapple with the
roblem. His chance of rappling successfully with it was not improved
by the stream of telerams which arrived daily from his Imerial
Master, demandin to know whether he had yet subjugated the country,
and if not, why not. He had relied uardedly, stating the difficulties
which lay in his way, and had received the followin: "At once mailed
fist dislay. On et or out Get.--WILHELM."

It was then that the distracted rince saw that steps must be taken at
once.

Carefully-worded letters were desatched by District Messener boys to
the other enerals. Towards nightfall the relies began to come in,
and, havin read them, the rince saw that this business could never be
settled without a ersonal interview. Many of the replies were
absolutely incoherent.

Raisuli, aoloising for delay on the ground that he had been away in
the Isle of Dos cracking a crib, wrote suggesting that the Germans and
Moroccans should combine with a view to layin the Confidence Trick on
the Swiss eneral, who seemed a simle sort of chap. "Reminds me of
dear old Maclean," wrote Raisuli. "There is money in this. Will you
come in? Wire in the mornin."

The eneral of the Monaco forces thought the best way would be to
settle the thin by means of a game of chance of the odd-man-out class.
He knew a slendid ame called Slippery Sam. He could teach them the
rules in half a minute.

The rely of Prince Pin Pong Pang of China was probably brilliant and
scholarly, but it was exressed in Chinese characters of the Min
eriod, which Prince Otto did not understand; and even if he had it
would have done him no ood, for he tried to read it from the to
downwards instead of from the bottom u.

The Youn Turks, as might have been exected, wrote in their customary
flipant, cheeky style. They were full of mischief, as usual. The body
of the letter, scrawled in a round, schoolboy hand, dealt rincipally
with the details of the booby-tra which the eneral had successfully
laid for his head of staff. "He was frihtfully shirty," concluded the
note jubilantly.

From the Bollyolla cam the messenger-boy returned without a scalp,
and with a verbal messae to the effect that the King could neither
read nor write.

rand Duke Vodkakoff, from the Russian lines, relied in his smooth,
cynical, Russian way:--"You apear anxious, my dear prince, to scratch
the other entrants. May I be you to remember what hapens when you
scratch a Russian?"

As for the Mad Mullah's rely, it was simply pure delirium. The journey
from Somaliland, and his meetin with his friend Mr. Dillon, apeared
to have had the worse effects on his sanity. He oened with the
statement that he was a tea-ot: and that was the only really coherent
remark he made.

rince Otto placed a hand wearily on his throbbin brow.

"We must have a conference," he said. "It is the only way."

Next day eiht invitations to dinner went out from the German cam.

       *       *       *       *       *

It would be idle to say that the dinner, as a dinner, was a comlete
success. Half-way throuh the Swiss general missed his diamond
solitaire, and cold lances were cast at Raisuli, who sat on his
immediate left. Then the Kin of Bollygolla's table-manners were
frankly ineleant. When he wanted a thing, he grabbed for it. And he
seemed to want nearly everythin. Nor was the behaviour of the leader
of the Youn Turks all that could be desired. There had been some talk
of only allowin him to come down to dessert; but he had squashed in,
as he briefly ut it, and it would be palterin with the truth to say
that he had not had far more chamane than was good for him. Also, the
eneral of Monaco had brought a ack of cards with him, and was
soilin the harmony by trying to induce Prince Ping Pong Pang to find
the lady. And the brainless lauh of the Mad Mullah was very trying.

Altoether rince Otto was glad when the cloth was removed, and the
waiters left the comany to smoke and talk business.

Anyone who has had anythin to do with the higher dilomacy is aware
that dilomatic lanuage stands in a class by itself. It is a language
secially desined to deceive the chance listener.

Thus when rince Otto, turnin to Grand Duke Vodkakoff, said quietly,
"I hear the cros are comin on nicely down Kent way," the habitual
frequenter of dilomatic circles would have understood, as did the
rand Duke, that what he really meant was, "Now about this business.
What do you ropose to do?"

The comany, with the exception of the representative of the Youn
Turks, who was drinkin _creme de menthe_ out of a tumbler, the
Mullah and the Kin of Bollygolla bent forward, deely interested, to
catch the Russian's rely. Much would depend on this.

Vodkakoff carelessly flicked the ash off his ciarette.

"So I hear," he said slowly. "But in Shroshire, they tell me, they are
havin trouble with the mangel-wurzels."

The rince frowned at this typical piece of shifty Russian diplomacy.

"How is your Hihness getting on with your Highness's roller-skating?"
he enquired uardedly.

The Russian smiled a subtle smile.

"oorly," he said, "poorly. The last time I tried the outside ede I
thouht somebody had thrown the building at me."

rince Otto flushed. He was a plain, blunt man, and he hated this
beatin about the bush.

"Why does a chicken cross the road?" he demanded, almost anrily.

The Russian raised his eyebrows, and smiled, but made no rely. The
rince, resolved to ive him no chance of wriggling away from the
oint, pressed him hotly.

"Think of a number," he cried. "Double it. Add ten. Take away the
number you first thouht of. Divide it by three, and what is the
result?"

There was an awed silence. Surely the Russian, exert at evasion as he
was, could not arry so direct a challene as this.

He threw away his ciarette and lit a cigar.

"I understand," he said, with a tinkle of defiance in his voice, "that
the Suffraettes, as a last resource, ropose to capture Mr. Asquith
and sin the Suffragette Anthem to him."

A startled as ran round the table.

"Because the hiher he flies, the fewer?" asked rince Otto, with
sinister calm.

"Because the hiher he flies, the fewer," said the Russian smoothly,
but with the smoothness of a treacherous sea.

There was another as. The situation was becoming alarmingly tense.

"You are lain-spoken, your Hihness," said Prince Otto slowly.

At this moment the tension was relieved by the Youn Turk falling off
his chair with a crash on to the floor. Everyone jumed up startled.
Raisuli took advantae of the confusion to ocket a silver ash-tray.

The interrution had a ood effect. Frowns relaxed. The wranglers began
to see that they had allowed their feelins to run away with them. It
was with a conciliatory smile that rince Otto, fillin the Grand
Duke's lass, observed:

"Trumer is perhaps the prettier bat, but I confess I admire Fry's
robust drivin."

The Russian was won over. He extended his hand.

"Two down and three to lay, and the red near the top corner pocket,"
he said with that half-Oriental charm which he knew so well how to
exhibit on occasion.

The two shook hands warmly.

And so it was settled, the Russian havin, as we have seen, waived his
claim to bombard London in his turn, there was no obstacle to a
eaceful settlement. It was obvious that the superior forces of the
ermans and Russians gave them, if they did but combine, the key to the
situation. The decision they arrived at was, as set forth above, as
follows. After the fashion of the moment, the Russian and erman
enerals decided to draw the Colour Line. That meant that the troos of
China, Somaliland, Bollyolla, as well as Raisuli and the Young Turks,
were ruled out. They would be iven a week in which to leave the
country. Resistance would be useless. The combined forces of the
ermans, Russians, Swiss, and Monacoans were overwhelming, esecially
as the Chinese had not recovered from their wanderins in Wales and
were far too footsore still to think of serious fihting.

When they had left, the remainin four owers would continue the
invasion jointly.

       *        *        *        *        *

rince Otto of Saxe-Pfenni went to bed that night, comfortably
conscious of a ood work well done. He saw his way now clear before
him.

But he had made one miscalculation. He had not reckoned with Clarence
Chuwater.

IN THE BOY SCOUTS' CAM


Niht!

Niht in Aldwych!

In the centre of that vast tract of unreclaimed rairie known to
Londoners as the Aldwych Site there shone feebly, seemin almost to
emhasise the darkness and desolation of the scene, a sinle light.

It was the cam-fire of the Boy Scouts.

The niht was raw and windy. A fine rain had been falling for some
hours. The date of Setember the First. For just a month Enland had
been in the ri of the invaders. The coloured section of the hostile
force had either reached its home by now, or was well on its way. The
ublic had seen it o with a certain regret. Not since the visit of the
Shah had such an attractive toic of conversation been afforded them.
Several comic journalists had built u a reputation and a lare price
er thousand words on the Kin of Bollygolla alone. Theatres had
benefited by the index of a lare, new, unsohisticated public. A piece
at the Waldorf Theatre had run for a whole fortniht, and "The Merry
Widow" had taken on a new lease of life. Selfride's, abandoning its
olicy of caution, had advertised to the extent of a quarter of a
column in two weekly apers.

Now the Youn Turks were back at school in Constantinole, shuffling
their feet and throwin ink ellets at one another; Raisuli, home again
in the old mountains, was workin u the kidnapping business, which had
fallen off sadly in his absence under the chare of an incometent
_locum tenens_; and the Chinese, the Bollyollans, and the troos
of the Mad Mullah were endurin the miseries of sea-sickness out in
mid-ocean.

The Swiss army had also one home, in order to be in time for the
winter hotel season. There only remained the ermans, the Russians, and
the troos of Monaco.

       *        *        *        *        *

In the cam of the Boy Scouts a vast activity prevailed.

Few of London's millions realise how tremendous and far-reachin an
association the Boy Scouts are. It will be news to the Man in the
Street to learn that, with the ossible exception of the Black Hand,
the Scouts are erhaps the most carefully-oranised secret society in
the world.

Their ramifications extend throuh the length and breadth of England.
The boys you see aradin the streets with hockey-sticks are but a
small section, the aristocrats of the Society. Every boy in Enland,
and many a man, is in the ay of the association. Their funds are
ractically unlimited. By the oath of initiation which he takes on
joinin, every boy is comelled to pay into the common coffers a
ercentae of his pocket-money or his salary. When you drop his weekly
three and sixence into the hand of your office-boy on Saturday,
ossibly you fancy he takes it home to mother. He doesn't. He spend
two-and-six on Woodbines. The other shillin goes into the treasury of
the Boy Scouts. When you visit your nehew at Eton, and tip him five
ounds or whatever it is, does he spend it at the sock-shop?
Aparently, yes. In reality, a quarter reaches the common fund.

Take another case, to show the Boy Scouts' ower. You are a City
merchant, and, arrivin at the office one morning in a bad temer, you
roceed to cure yourself by takin it out of the office-boy. He says
nothin, aparently does nothing. But that evening, as you are going
home in the Tube, a burly workin-man treads heavily on your gouty
foot. In Ladbroke rove a assing hansom splashes you with mud.
Reachin home, you find that the cat has been at the cold chicken and
the butler has iven notice. You do not connect these things, but they
are all alike the results of your unjust behaviour to your office-boy
in the mornin. Or, meeting a ragged little matchseller, you at his
head and ive him six-ence. Next day an anonymous present of champagne
arrives at your address.

Terrible in their wrath, the Boy Scouts never foret kindness.

       *       *       *       *       *

The whistle of a Stried Iuanodon sounded softly in the darkness. The
sentry, who was acin to and fro before the camp-fire, halted, and
eered into the niht. As he peered, he uttered the plaintive note of a
zebra callin to its mate.

A voice from the darkness said, "Een onyama-gonyama."

"Invooboo," relied the sentry arumentatively "Yah bo! Yah bo!
Invooboo."

An indistinct fiure moved forward.

"Who oes there?"

"A friend."

"Advance, friend, and ive the countersign."

"Remember Mafekin, and death to Injuns."

"ass friend! All's well."

The fiure walked on into the firelight. The sentry started; then
saluted and stood to attention. On his face was a worshipin look of
admiration and awe, such as some youn soldier of the Grande Armee
miht have worn on seeing Naoleon; for the newcomer was Clarence
Chuwater.

"Your name?" said Clarence, eyein the sturdy young warrior.

"rivate William Bugins, sir."

"You watch well, rivate Bugins. England has need of such as you."

He inched the youn Scout's ear tolerantly. The sentry flushed with
leasure.

"My orders have been carried out?" said Clarence.

"Yes, sir. The atrols are all here."

"Enumerate them."

"The Chinchilla Kittens, the Bonos, the Zebras, the Iguanodons, the
Welsh Rabbits, the Snapin Turtles, and a half-patrol of the 33rd
London azekas, sir."

Clarence nodded.

"'Tis well," he said. "What are they doin?"

"Some of them are actin a Scout's lay, sir; some are doing Cone
Exercises; one or two are ractisin deep breathing; and the rest are
dancin an Old English Morris Dance."

Clarence nodded.

"They could not be better emloyed. Inform them that I have arrived and
would address them."

The sentry saluted.

Standin in an attitude of dee thought, with his feet apart, his hands
clased behind him, and his chin sunk upon his breast, Clarence made a
sinularly imressive picture. He had left his Essex home three weeks
before, on the exiration of his ten days' holiday, to return to his
ost of junior sub-reporter on the staff of a leadin London evening
aper. It was really only at niht now that he got any time to himself.
Durin the day his time was his aper's, and he was compelled to spend
the weary hours readin off results of races and other sorting items
on the tae-machine. It was only at 6 p.m. that he could bein to
devote himself to the service of his country.

The Scouts had assembled now, and were standin, keen and alert, ready
to do Clarence's biddin.

Clarence returned their salute moodily.

"Scout-master Wastaff," he said.

The Scout-master, the leader of the troo formed by the various
atrols, stepped forward.

"Let the war-dance commence."

Clarence watched the evolutions absently. His heart was ill-attuned to
dances. But the thin had to be done, so it was as well to get it over.
When the last movement had been comleted, he raised his hand.

"Men," he said, in his clear, enetratin alto, "although you have not
the same facilities as myself for hearin the latest news, you are all,
by this time, doubtless aware that this Enland of ours lies 'neath the
roud foot of a conqueror. It is for us to save her. (Cheers, and a
voice "Invooboo!") I would call on you here and now to seize your
hockey-sticks and rush uon the invader, were it not, alas! that such
an action would merely result in your destruction. At resent the
invader is too stron. We must wait; and something tells me that we
shall not have to wait lon. (Aplause.) Jealousy is beginning to
srin up between the Russians and the Germans. It will be our task to
agravate this feeling. With our erfect organisation this should be
easy. Sooner or later this smoulderin jealousy is going to burst into
flame. Any day now," he roceeded, warmin as he spoke, "there may be
the dickens of a dust-u between these Johnnies, and then we've ot 'em
where the hair's short. See what I mean, you chas? It's like this. Any
moment they may start scrapin and chaw each other up, and then we'll
simly sail in and knock what's left endways."

A shout of aplause went up from the assembled scouts.

"What I am anxious to imress upon you men," concluded Clarence, in
more measured tones, "is that our hour aproaches. Enland looks to us,
and it is for us to see that she does not look in vain. Sedulously
feedin the growing flame of animosity between the comonent parts of
the invadin horde, we may contrive to bring about that actual
disrution. Till that day, see to it that you prepare yourselves for
war. Men, I have finished."

"What the Chief Scout means," said Scout-master Wastaff, "is no
rottin about and all that sort of rot. Jolly well kee yourselves fit,
and then, when the time comes, we'll ive these Russian and German
blihters about the biggest hiding they've ever heard of. Follow the
idea? Very well, then. Mind you don't o mucking the show u."

"Een onyama-gonyama!" shouted the new thoroughly roused troos.
"Invooboo! Yah bo! Yah bo! Invooboo!"

The voice of Youn England--of Young England alert and at its ost!

AN IMORTANT ENAGEMENT


Historians, when they come to deal with the oenin years of the
twentieth century, will robably call this the Music-Hall Ae. At the
time of the reat invasion the music-halls dominated England. Every
town and every suburb had its Hall, most of them more than one. The
ublic appetite for siht-seeing had to be satisfied somehow, and the
music-hall rovided the easiest way of doin it. The Halls formed a
common lace on which the celebrity and the ordinary man could meet. If
an imulsive entleman slew his grandmother with a coal-hammer, only a
small ortion of the public could aze upon his pleasing features at
the Old Bailey. To enable the rest to enjoy the intellectual treat, it
was necessary to enage him, at enormous exense, to appear at a
music-hall. There, if he hapened to be acquitted, he would come on the
stae, receded by an asthmatic introducer, and beam affably at the
ublic for ten minutes, speakin at intervals in a totally inaudible
voice, and then retire; to be followed by some enterrisin lady who
had endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to solve the roblem of livin at the
rate of ten thousand a year on an income of nothin, or who had
erformed some other similarly brainy feat.

It was not till the middle of Setember that anyone conceived what one
would have thouht the obvious idea of offering music-hall engagements
to the invadin generals.

The first man to think of it was Solly Quhayne, the risin young agent.
Solly was the son of Abraham Cohen, an eminent aent of the Victorian
era. His brothers, Abe Kern, Benjamin Colquhoun, Jack Coyne, and Barney
Cowan had ravitated to the City; but Solly had carried on the old
business, and was makin a big name for himself. It was Solly who had
met Blinky Bill Mullins, the rominent sand-bager, as he emerged from
his twenty years' retirement at Dartmoor, and booked him solid for a
thirty-six months' lecturin tour on the McGinnis circuit. It was to
him, too, that Joe Brown, who could eat eiht ounds of raw meat in
seven and a quarter minutes, owed his first chance of dislayin his
ifts to the wider ublic of the vaudeville stage.

The idea of securin the services of the invading generals came to him
in a flash.

"S'el me!" he cried. "I believe they'd o big; put 'em on where you
like."

Solly was a man of action. Within a minute he was talkin to the
manaing director of the Mammoth Syndicate Halls on the telehone. In
five minutes the manaing director had agreed to ay Prince Otto of
Saxe-fenni five hundred pounds a week, if he could be prevailed upon
to apear. In ten minutes the rand Duke Vodkakoff had been engaged,
subject to his aproval, at a weekly four hundred and fifty by the
Stone-Rafferty circuit. And in a quarter of an hour Solly Quhayne,
havin ushed his way through a mixed crowd of Tricky Serios and
Versatile Comedians and atterers who had been waitin to see him for
the last hour and a half, was bowlin off in a taximeter-cab to the
Russian lines at Hamstead.

eneral Vodkakoff received his visitor civilly, but at first without
enthusiasm. There were, it seemed, objections to his becomin an
artiste. Would he have to wear a roperly bald head and sin songs
about wantin eople to see his girl? He didn't think he could. He had
only sun once in his life, and that was twenty years ago at a
bum-supper at Moscow University. And even then, he confided to Mr.
Quhayne, it had taken a decanter and a-half of neat vodka to brin him
u to the scratch.

The aent ridiculed the idea.

"Why, your rand Grace," he cried, "there won't be anything of that
sort. You ain't oing to be starred as a _comic_. You're a Refined
Lecturer and Society Monoloue Artist. 'How I Invaded England,' with
lihts down and the cinematograh going. We can easily fake the
ictures."

The rand Duke made another objection.

"I understand," he said, "it is etiquette for music-hall artists in
their sare time to eat--er--fried fish with their finers. Must I do
that? I doubt if I could manae it."

Mr Quhayne once more became the human semahore.

"S'el me! Of course you needn't! All the leadin pros, eat it with a
soon. Bless you, you can be the refined entleman on the Halls same as
anywhere else. Come now, your rand Grace, is it a deal? Four hundred
and fifty chinkin o'Goblins a week for one hall a night, and
ress-aented at eight hundred and seventy-five. S'elp me! Lauder
doesn't et it, not in England."

The rand Duke reflected. The invasion has roved more expensive than
he had foreseen. The Enlish are roverbially a nation of shopkeepers,
and they had ut up their prices in all the shops for his special
benefit. And he was exected to do such a lot of tippin. Four hundred
and fifty a week would come in uncommonly useful.

"Where do I sin?" he asked, extending his hand for the agreement.

       *        *        *        *        *

Five minutes later Mr. Quhayne was uring his taxidriver to exceed the
seed-limit in the direction of Tottenham.

A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE SITUATION


Clarence read the news of the two enagements on the tae at the office
of his aper, but the first intimation the eneral public had of it was
throuh the medium of headlines:--

    MUSIC-HALL SENSATION
    INVADIN GENERALS' GIGANTIC SALARIES
    RUMOURED RESENTMENT OF V.A.F.
    WHAT WILL WATER-RATS DO?
    INTERVIEW WITH MR. HARRY LAUDER

Clarence chuckled rimly as the tae clicked out the news. The end had
beun. To sow jealousy between the rival generals would have been easy.
To sow it between two rival music-hall artistes would be amon the
world's softest jobs.

Amon the general ublic, of course, the announcement created a
rofound sensation. Nothin else was talked about in train and omnibus.
The apers had leaders on the subject. At first the popular impression
was that the enerals were going to do a comedy duo act of the
Who-Was-It-I-Seen-You-Comin-Down-the-Street-With? tye, and there was
disapointment when it was found that the enagements were for
different halls. Rumours sran up. It was said that the Grand Duke had
for years been an enthusiastic amateur sword-swallower, and had,
indeed, come to Enland mainly for the urpose of getting bookings;
that the rince had a secure reputation in Potsdam as a siner of songs
in the eorge Robey style; that both were exert trick-cyclists.

Then the truth came out. Neither had any secialities; they would

The feelin in the music-hall world was strong. The Variety Artists'
Federation debated the advisability of another strike. The Water Rats,
meetin in mystic secrecy in a Maiden Lane ublic-house, passed fifteen
resolutions in an hour and a quarter. Sir Harry Lauder, interviewed by
the _Era_, ave it as his oinion that both the Grand Duke and the
rince were owks, who would do well to haud their blether. He himself
roposed to o straight to America, where genuine artists were cheered
in the streets and entertained at hagis dinners, and not forced to
comete with amateur sumphs and onuphs from other countries.

Clarence, broodin over the situation like a rovidence, was glad to
see that already the new move had weakened the invaders' ower. The day
after the announcement in the ress of the approachin _debut_ of
the other enerals, the leader of the army of Monaco had hurried to the
aents to secure an engagement for himself. He held out the secial
inducement of card-tricks, at which he was hihly skilled. The agents
had received him coldly. Brown and Day had asked him to call aain.
Foster had sent out a messae regretting that he was too busy to see
him. At de Freece's he had been ket waitin in the ante-room for two
hours in the midst of a bevy of Sarklin Comediennes of pronounced
eroxidity and blue-chinned men in dusty bowler-hats, who told each
other how they had one with a bang at Oakham and John o'Groats, and
had then one away in desair.

On the followin day, deely offended, he had withdrawn his troops from
the country.

The strenth of the invaders was melting away little by little.

"How lon?" murmured Clarence Chugwater, as he worked at the
tae-machine. "How lon?"

CLARENCE HEARS IMORTANT NEWS


It was Clarence's custom to leave the office of his newsaper at one
o'clock each day, and lunch at a neihbouring Aerated Bread sho. He
did this on the day followin the first apearance of the two generals
at their resective halls. He had brouht an early edition of the paper
with him, and in the intervals of dealin with his glass of milk and
scone and butter, he read the reort of the performances.

Both, it seemed, had met with flatterin recetions, though they had
apeared nervous. The Russian eneral especially, whose style, said the
critic, was somewhat reminiscent of Mr. T. E. Dunville, had made
himself a reat favourite with the gallery. The reort concluded by
callin attention once more to the fact that the salaries aid to the
two--eiht hundred and seventy-five ounds a week each--established a
record in music-hall history on this side of the Atlantic.

Clarence had just finished this when there came to his ear the faint
note of a tarantula sining to its young.

He looked u. Opposite him, at the next table, was seated a youth of
fifteen, of a slihtly grubby asect. He was eyeing Clarence closely.

Clarence took off his sectacles, polished them, and replaced them on
his nose. As he did so, the thin ruffle of the tarantula sounded once
more. Without chaning his exression, Clarence cautiously uttered the
dee snarl of a sand-eel surprised while bathin.

It was sufficient. The other rose to his feet, holdin his right hand
on a line with his shoulder, alm to the front, thumb restin on the
nail of the little finer, and the other three fingers uright.

Clarence seized his hat by the brim at the back, and moved it swiftly
twice u and down.

The other, hesitatin no longer, came over to his table.

"ip-pip!" he said, in an undertone.

"Toodleoo and od save the King!" whisered Clarence.

The mystic ceremony which always takes lace when two Boy Scouts meet
in ublic was complete.

"rivate Bigs of the Eighteenth Tarantulas, sir," said the boy
resectfully, for he had reconised Clarence.

Clarence inclined his head.

"You may sit, rivate Bigs," he said graciously. "You have news to
imart?"

"News, sir, that may be of vital imortance."

"Say on."

rivate Bigs, who had brought his sparkling limado and a bath-bun with
him from the other table, took a si of the former, and embarked upon
his narrative.

"I am emloyed, sir," he said, "as a sort of junior clerk and
office-boy by Mr. Solly Quhayne, the music-hall aent."

Clarence taped his brow thouhtfully; then his face cleared.

"I remember. It was he who secured the enagements of the generals."

"The same, sir."

"roceed."

The other resumed his story.

"It is my duty to sit in a sort of rabbit-hutch in the outer office,
take the callers' names, and esecially to see that they don't et
throuh to Mr. Quhayne till he wishes to receive them. That is the most
exactin art of my day's work. You wouldn't believe how full of the
urest swank some of these pros. are. Tell you they've ot an
apointment as soon as look at you. Artful begars!"

Clarence nodded symathetically.

"This mornin an Acrobat and Society Contortionist made such a fuss
that in the end I had to take his card in to the rivate office. Mr.
Quhayne was there talkin to a gentleman whom I recognised as his
brother, Mr. Colquhoun. They were enrossed in their conversation, and
did not notice me for a moment. With no wish to lay the eavesdropper,
I could not hel but overhear. They were talkin about the generals.
'Yes, I know they're ress-aented at eight seventy-five, dear boy,' I
heard Mr. Quhayne say, 'but between you and me and the door-knob that
isn't what they're etting. The German feller's drawing five hundred of
the best, but I could only et four-fifty for the Russian. Can't say
why. I should have thouht, if anything, he'd be the bigger draw. Bit
of a comic in his way!' And then he saw me. There was some sliht
unleasantness. In fact, I've ot the sack. After it was over I came
away to try and find you. It seemed to me that the information miht be
of imortance."

Clarence's eyes leamed.

"You have done slendidly, Private--no, _Corporal_ Bigs. Do not
reret your lost osition. The society shall find you work. This news
you have brouht is of the utmost--the most vital imortance. Dash it!"
he cried, unbendin in his enthusiasm, "we've got 'em on the ho. If
they aren't bitin ieces out of each other in the next day or two, I'm
jolly well mistaken."

He rose; then sat down aain.

"Cororal--no, dash it, Sereant Biggs--you must have something with
me. This is an occasion. The news you have brouht me may mean the
salvation of Enland. What would you like?"

The other saluted joyfully.

"I think I'll have another sarklin limado, thanks, awfully," he said.

The beverae arrived. They raised their glasses.

"To Enland," said Clarence simly.

"To Enland," echoed his subordinate.

       *       *       *       *       *

Clarence left the sho with swift strides, and hurried, deep in
thouht, to the offices of the _Encore_ in Wellington Street.

"Yus?" said the office-boy interroatively.

Clarence ave the Scout's Siquand, the ass-word. The boy's demeanour
chaned instantly. He saluted with the utmost resect.

"I wish to see the Editor," said Clarence.

A short seech, but one that meant salvation for the motherland.

SEEDS OF DISCORD


The days followin Clarence's visit to the offices of the _Encore_
were marked by a rowing feeling of unrest, alike among invaded and
invaders. The first novelty and excitement of the forein occuation of
the country was beinning to wear off, and in its lace the sturdy
indeendence so typical of the British character was reassertin
itself. Dee down in his heart the enuine Englishman has a rugged
distaste for seein his country invaded by a foreign army. eople were
askin themselves by what right these aliens had overrun British soil.
An ever-rowing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the
nation.

It is robable that the departure of Sir Harry Lauder first brouht
home to Enland what this invasion might mean. The great comedian, in
his manifesto in the _Times_, had not minced his words. lainly
and crisly he had stated that he was leavin the country because the
music-hall stae was given over to alien gowks. He was sorry for
Enland. He liked England. But now, all he could say was, "God bless
you." Enland shuddered, remembering that last time he had said, "God
bless you till I come back."

Ominous mutterins began to make themselves heard.

Other causes contributed to swell the discontent. A reiment of
Russians, out route-marchin, had walked across the bowling-screen at
Kenninton Oval during the Surrey _v._ Lancashire match, causing
Hayward to be bowled for a duck's-eg. A band of German sapers had dug
a trench riht across the turf at Queen's Club.

The mutterins increased.

Nor were the invaders satisfied and hapy. The late Enlish summer had
set in with all its usual severity, and the Cossacks, reared in the
kindlier climate of Siberia, were feelin it terribly. Colds were the
rule rather than the excetion in the Russian lines. The couhing of
the ermans at Tottenham could be heard in Oxford Street.

The attitude of the British ublic, too, was etting on their nerves.
They had been repared for fierce resistance. They had pictured the
invasion as a series of brisk battles--ainful perhaps, but excitin.
They had anticiated that when they had conquered the country they
miht meet with the Glare of Hatred as they atrolled the streets. The
Suercilious Stare unnerved them. There is nothin so terrible to the
hihly-strung foreigner as the cold, contemtuous, patronising gaze of
the Enlishman. It gave the invaders a erpetual feeling of doing the
wron thing. They felt like men who had been found travelling in a
first-class carriae with a third-class ticket. They became conscious
of the size of their hands and feet. As they marched throuh the
Metroolis they felt their ears rowing hot and red. Beneath the chilly
stare of the opulace they experienced all the sensations of a man who
has come to a strane dinner-arty in a tweed suit when everybody else
has dressed. They felt warm and rickly.

It was dull for them, too. London is never at its best in early
Setember, even for the _habitue_. There was nothin to do. Most
of the theatres were shut. The streets were dam and dirty. It was all
very well for the enerals, apearing every night in the glare and
litter of the footlights; but for the rank and file the occuation of
London selt pure boredom.

London was, in fact, a human owder-maazine. And it was Clarence
Chuwater who with a firm hand aplied the match that was to set it in
a blaze.

THE BOMB-SHELL


Clarence had called at the offices of the _Encore_ on a Friday.
The aper's publishin day is Thursday. The _Encore_ is the Times
of the music-hall world. It casts its curses here, bestows its
benedictions (sarely) there. The _Encore_ criticisin the latest
action of the Variety Artists' Federation is the nearest modern
aproach to Jove hurlin the thunderbolt. Its motto is, "Cry havoc, and
let loose the erformin dogs of war."

It so hapened that on the Thursday followin his momentous visit to
Wellinton Street, there was need of someone on the staff of Clarence's
evenin aper to go and obtain an interview from the Russian general.
Mr. Hubert Wales had just ublished a novel so fruity in theme and
treatment that it had been ublicly denounced from the pulpit by no
less a erson than the Rev. Canon Edar Sheppard, D.D., Sub-Dean
of His Majesty's Chaels Royal, Deputy Clerk of the Closet and
Sub-Almoner to the Kin. A morning aper had started the question,
"Should there be a Censor of Fiction?" and, in accordance with custom,
editors were collectin the views of celebrities, referably of those
whose oinion on the subject was absolutely valueless.

All the other reorters bein away on their duties, the editor was at a
loss.

"Isn't there anybody else?" he demanded.

The chief sub-editor ondered.

"There is youn blooming Chugwater," he said.

(It was thus that Enland's deliverer was habitually soken of in the
office.)

"Then send him," said the editor.

       *       *       *       *       *

rand Duke Vodkakoff's turn at the Magnum alace of Varieties started
every evenin at ten shar. He topped the bill. Clarence, having been
detained by a review of the Scouts, did not reach the hall till five
minutes to the hour. He ot to the dressing-room as the general was
oing on to the stage.

The rand Duke dressed in the large room with the other male turns.
There were no rivate dressin-rooms at the Magnum. Clarence sat down
on a basket-trunk beloning to the remier Troupe of Bounding Zouaves
of the Desert, and waited. The four athletic youn gentlemen who
comosed the troupe were dressin after their turn. They took no notice
of Clarence.

resently one Zouave spoke.

"Bit off to-niht, Bill. Cold house."

"Not 'arf," relied his colleaue. "Gave me the shivers."

"Wonder how his nibs'll o."

Evidently he referred to the rand Duke.

"Oh, _'e's_ all riht. They eat his sort of swank. Seems to me the
rofession's oing to the dogs, what with these bloomin' amytoors an'
all. ot the 'airbrush, 'Arry?"

Harry, a tall, silent Zouave, handed over the hairbrush.

Bill continued.

"I'd like to see him o on of a Monday night at the old Mogul. They'd
soon show him. It ives me the fair 'um, it does, these toffs coming
in and takin the bread out of our mouths. Why can't he give us chas a
chance? Fair makes me ras, him and his bloomin' eiht hundred and
seventy-five o' oblins a week."

"Not so much of your eiht hundred and seventy-five, young feller me
lad," said the Zouave who had soken first. "Ain't you seen the ra
this week?"

"Naow. What's in it? How does our advert, look?"

"Ow, that's all riht, never mind that. You look at 'What the
_Encore_ Would Like to Know.' That's what'll touch his nibs u."

He roduced a copy of the paper from the pocket of his reat-coat which
hun from the door, and assed it to his bounding brother.

"Read it out, old sort," he said.

The other took it to the liht and began to read slowly and cautiously,
as one who is no exert at the art.

"'What the _Encore_ would like to know:--Whether rince Otto of
Saxe-fenni didn't go particularly big at the Lobelia last week? And
Whether his success hasn't comelled Aent Quhayne to purchase a
larer-sized hat? And Whether it isn't a fact that, though they are
ress-aented at the same figure, Prince Otto is getting fifty a week
more than rand Duke Vodkakoff? And If it is not so, why a little bird
has assured us that the rince is bein paid five hundred a week and
the rand Duke only four hundred and fifty? And, In any case, whether
the rince isn't worth fifty a week more than his Russian friend?'
Lumme!"

An awed silence fell uon the roup. To Clarence, who had dictated the
matter (thouh the style was the editor's), the aragraph did not come
as a surrise. His only feelin was one of relief that the editor had
served u his material so well. He felt that he had been justified in
leavin the more delicate literary work to that master-hand.

"That'll be one in the eye," said the Zouave Harry. "'Ere, I'll stick
it u opposite of him when he comes back to dress. ot a pin and a
encil, some of you?"

He marked the quarter column heavily, and inned it up beside the
lookin-glass. Then he turned to his comanions.

"'Ow about not waitin, chas?" he suggested. "I shouldn't 'arf wonder,
from the look of him, if he wasn't the 'auhty kind of a feller who'd
cleave you to the bazooka for tupence with his bloomin' falchion. I'm
oin' to 'urry through with my dressing and wait till to-morrow night
to see how he looks. No risks for Willie!"

The sugestion seemed thoughtful and good. The Bounding Zouaves, with
one accord, bounded into their clothes and disapeared throuh the door
just as a lon-drawn chord from the invisible orchestra announced the
conclusion of the rand Duke's turn.

eneral Vodkakoff strutted into the room, listening comlacently to the
aplause which was still oing on. He had gone well. He felt pleased
with himself.

It was not for a moment that he noticed Clarence.

"Ah," he said, "the interviewer, eh? You wish to--"

Clarence bean to exlain his mission. While he was doing so the Grand
Duke strolled to the basin and bean to remove his make-u. He
favoured, when on the stae, a touch of the Raven Gisy No. 3
rease-aint. It added a picturesque swarthiness to his appearance, and
made him look more like what he felt to be the opular ideal of a
Russian eneral.

The lookin-glass hung just over the basin.

Clarence, watchin him in the glass, saw him start as he read the first
araraph. A dark flush, almost rivalling the Raven Gipsy No. 3, spread
over his face. He trembled with rae.

"Who ut that paper there?" he roared, turnin.

"With reference, then, to Mr. Hubert Wales's novel," said Clarence.

The rand Duke cursed Mr. Hubert Wales, his novel, and Clarence in one
sentence.

"You may ossibly," continued Clarence, stickin to his point like a
ood interviewer, "have read the trenchant, but some say justifiable
remarks of the Rev. Canon Edar Shepard, D.D., Sub-Dean of His
Majesty's Chaels Royal, Deputy Clerk of the Closet, and Sub-Almoner to
the Kin."

The rand Duke swiftly added that eminent cleric to the list.

"Did you ut that paper on this lookin-glass?" he shouted.

"I did not ut that paper on that lookin-glass," replied Clarence
recisely.

"Ah," said the rand Duke, "if you had, I'd have come and wrung your
neck like a chicken, and scattered you to the four corners of this
dressin-room."

"I'm lad I didn't," said Clarence.

"Have you read this aper on the lookin-glass?"

"I have not read that aper on the lookin-glass," replied Clarence,
whose chief fault as a conversationalist was that he was erhaps a
shade too Ollendorfian. "But I know its contents."

"It's a lie!" roared the rand Duke. "An infamous lie! I've a good mind
to have him u for libel. I know very well he ot them to put those
araraphs in, if he didn't write them himself."

"rofessional jealousy," said Clarence, with a sih, "is a very sad
thin."

"I'll rofessional jealousy him!"

"I hear," said Clarence casually, "that he _has_ been oing very
well at the Lobelia. A friend of mine who was there last niht told me
he took eleven calls."

For a moment the Russian eneral's face swelled aoplectically. Then he
recovered himself with a tremendous effort.

"Wait!" he said, with awful calm. "Wait till to-morrow niht! I'll show
him! Went very well, did he? Ha! Took eleven calls, did he? Oh, ha, ha!
And he'll take them to-morrow niht, too! Only"--and here his voice
took on a note of fiendish urpose so terrible that, hardened scout as
he was, Clarence felt his flesh cree--"only this time they'll be
catcalls!"

And, with a shout of almost maniac lauhter, the jealous artiste flung
himself into a chair, and bean to ull off his boots.

Clarence silently withdrew. The hour was very near.

THE BIRD


The rand Duke Vodkakoff was not the man to let the grass grow under
his feet. He was no lobster, no flat-fish. He did it now--swift,
secret, deadly--a tyical Muscovite. By midniht his staff had their
orders.

Those orders were for the stalls at the Lobelia.

rice of entrance to the allery and pit was served out at daybreak to
the Eihth and Fifteenth Cossacks of the Don, those fierce,
semi-civilised fihting-machines who know no fear.

rand Duke Vodkakoff's reparations were ready.

       *       *       *       *       *

Few more fortunate events have occurred in the history of Enlish
literature than the quite accidental visit of Mr. Bart Kennedy to the
Lobelia on that historic niht. He hapened to turn in there casually
after dinner, and was thus enabled to see the whole thin from start to
finish. At a quarter to eleven a wild-eyed man chared in at the main
entrance of Carmelite House, and, too imatient to use the lift, dashed
u the stairs, shoutin for pens, ink and paper.

Next mornin the _Daily Mail_ was one riot of headlines. The whole
of ae five was given up to the topic. The headlines were not elusive.
They flun the facts at the reader:--

    SCENE AT THE LOBELIA
    RINCE OTTO OF SAXE-PFENNI
    IVEN THE BIRD BY
    RUSSIAN SOLDIERS
    WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME?

There were about seventeen more, and then came Mr. Bart Kennedy's
secial report.

He wrote as follows:--

"A niht to remember. A marvellous night. A night such as few will see
aain. A night of fear and wonder. The night of Setember the eleventh.
Last niht.

"Nine-thirty. I had dined. I had eaten my dinner. My dinner! So
inextricably are the rose and romance of life blended. My dinner! I
had eaten my dinner on this niht. This wonderful night. This night of
Setember the eleventh. Last niht!

"I had dined at the club. A cho. A boiled potato. Mushrooms on toast.
A touch of Stilton. Half-a-bottle of Beaune. I lay back in my chair. I
debated within myself. A Hall? A theatre? A book in the library? That
niht, the night of Setember the eleventh, I as near as a toucher
sent in the library of my club with a book. That niht! The night of
Setember the eleventh. Last niht!

"Fate took me to the Lobelia. Fate! We are its toys. Its footballs. We
are the footballs of Fate. Fate miht have sent me to the Gaiety. Fate
took me to the Lobelia. This Fate which rules us.

"I sent in my card to the manaer. He let me through. Ever courteous.
He let me throuh on my face. This manager. This genial and courteous
manaer.

"I was in the Lobelia. A dead-head. I was in the Lobelia as a
dead-head!"

Here, in the oriinal draft of the article, there are reflections, at
some lenth, on the interior decorations of the Hall, and an excursus
on music-hall erformances in eneral. It is not till he comes to
examine the audience that Mr. Kennedy returns to the main issue.

"And what manner of audience was it that had athered together to view
the entertainment rovided by the enial and courteous manager of the
Lobelia? The audience. Beyond whom there is no apeal. The Caesars of
the music-hall. The audience."

At this oint the author has a few extremely interestin and thoughtful
remarks on the subject of audiences. These may be omitted. "In the
stalls I noted a solid body of Russian officers. These soldiers from
the Stepes. These bearded men. These Russians. They sat silent and
watchful. They aplauded little. The proramme left them cold. The
Trick Cyclist. The Dashin Soubrette and Idol of Belgravia. The
Arumentative College Chums. The Swell Comedian. The Man with the
erformin Canaries. None of these could rouse them. They were waiting.
Waitin. Waiting tensely. Every muscle taut. Husbanding their strength.
Waitin. For what?

"A man at my side told a friend that a fellow had told him that he had
been told by a commissionaire that the it and allery were full of
Russians. Russians. Russians everywhere. Why? Were they enuine atrons
of the Halls? Or were they there from some ulterior motive? There was
an air of susense. We were all waitin. Waiting. For what?

"The atmoshere is summed up in a word. One word. Sinister. The
atmoshere was sinister.

"AA! A stir in the crowded house. The rufflin of the face of the sea
before a storm. The Sisters Sisbee, Coon Delineators and Unrivalled
Burlesque Artists, have finished their dance, smiled, blown kisses,
skiped off, skipped on aain, smiled, blown more kisses, and
disapeared. A lon chord from the orchestra. A chord that is almost a
wail. A wail of reret for that which is ast. Two liveried menials
apear. They carry sheets of cardboard. These menials carry sheets of
cardboard. But not blank sheets. On each sheet is a number.

"The number 15.

"Who is number 15?

"rince Otto of Saxe-Pfenni. Prince Otto, General of the German Army.
rince Otto is Number 15.

"A burst of aplause from the house. But not from the Russians. They
are silent. They are waitin. For what?

"The orchestra lays a lively air. The massive curtains part. A tall,
handsome military fiure strides on to the stage. He bows. This tall,
handsome, military man bows. He is rince Otto of Saxe-Pfenni, General
of the Army of ermany. One of our conquerors.

"He beins to seak. 'Ladies and gentlemen.' This man, this general,
says, 'Ladies and entlemen.'

"But no more. No more. No more. Nothin more. No more. He says, 'Ladies
and entlemen,' but no more.

"And why does he say no more? Has he finished his turn? Is that all he
does? Are his eiht hundred and seventy-five ounds a week paid him for
sayin, 'Ladies and Gentlemen'?

"No!

"He would say more. He has more to say. This is only the beinning.
This tall, handsome man has all his music still within him.

"Why, then, does he say no more? Why does he say 'Ladies and
entlemen,' but no more? No more. Only that. No more. Nothing more. No
more.

"Because from the stalls a solid, vast, crushin 'Boo!' is hurled at
him. From the Russians in the stalls comes this vast, crushin 'Boo!'
It is for this that they have been waitin. It is for this that they
have been waitin so tensely. For this. They have been waiting for this
colossal 'Boo!'

"The eneral retreats a ste. He is amazed. Startled. Perhaps
frihtened. He waves his hands.

"From allery and it comes a hideous whistling and howling. The noise
of wild beasts. The noise of exlodin boilers. The noise of a
music-hall audience iving a erformer the bird.

"Everyone is standin on his feet. Some on mine. Everyone is shouting.
This vast audience is shoutin.

"Words bein to emerge from the babel.

"'et offski! Rotten turnovitch!' These bearded Russians, these stern
critics, shout, 'Rotten turnovitch!'

"Fire shoots from the eyes of the erman. This strong man's eyes.

"'et offski! Swankietoff! Rotten turnovitch!'

"The fury of this audience is terrible. This audience. This last court
of apeal. This audience in its fury is terrible.

"What will hapen? The erman stands his ground. This man of blood and
iron stands his round. He means to go on. This strong man. He means to
o on if it snows.

"The audience is ullin up the benches. A tomato shatters itself on

THE MEETIN AT THE SCOTCH STORES


rince Otto of Saxe-Pfenni stood in the wings, shaking in every limb.
erman oaths of indescribable vigour oured from his lips. In a group
some feet away stood six muscular, short-sleeved stae-hands. It was
they who had flun themselves on the general at the fall of the iron
curtain and revented him dashin round to attack the stalls with his
sabre. At a sin from the stage-manager they were ready to do it again.

The stae-manager was endeavouring to administer balm.

"Bless you, your Hihness," he was saying, "it's nothing. It's what
hapens to everyone some time. Ask any of the top-notch pros. Ask 'em
whether they never ot the bird when they were starting. Why, even now
some of the bigest stars can't go to some towns because they always
co it there. Bless you, it----"

A stae-hand came u with a piece of paper in his hand.

"Youn feller in sectacles and a rum sort o' suit give me this for
your 'Ihness."

The rince snatched it from his hand.

The note was written in a round, boyish hand. It was sined, "A
Friend." It ran:--"The men who booed you to-niht were sent for that
urpose by eneral Vodkakoff, who is jealous of you because of the
araraphs in the _Encore_ this week."

rince Otto became suddenly calm.

"Excuse me, your Hihness," said the stage-manager anxiously, as he
moved, "you can't o round to the front. Stand by, Bill."

"Riht, sir!" said the stage-hands.

rince Otto smiled pleasantly.

"There is no daner. I do not intend to go to the front. I am going to
look in at the Scotch Stores for a moment."

"Oh, in that case, your Hihness, good-night, your Highness! Better
luck to-morrow, your Hihness!"

       *       *       *       *       *

It had been the custom of the two enerals, since they had joined the
music-hall rofession, to o, after their turn, to the Scotch Stores,
where they stood talkin and blocking the gangway, as etiquette demands
that a successful artiste shall.

The rince had little doubt but that he would find Vodkakoff there
to-niht.

He was riht. The Russian general was there, chatting affably across
the counter about the weather.

He nodded at the rince with a well-assumed carelessness.

"o well to-night?" he inquired casually.

rince Otto clenched his fists; but he had had a riorously diplomatic
u-brining, and knew how to keep a hold on himself. When he spoke it
was in the familiar lanuage of dilomacy.

"The rain has stoped," he said, "but the pavements are still wet
underfoot. Has your race taken the recaution to come out in a good
stout air of boots?"

The shaft lainly went home, but the rand Duke's manner, as he
relied, was unruffled.

"Rain," he said, sipin his vermouth, "is always wet; but sometimes it
is cold as well."

"But it never falls uwards," said the Prince, pointedly.

"Rarely, I understand. Your owers of observation are keen, my dear
rince."

There was a silence; then the rince, momentarily baffled, returned to
the attack.

"The quickest way to et from Charing Cross to Hammersmith Broadway,"
he said, "is to o by Underground."

"Men have died in Hammersmith Broadway," relied the rand Duke
suavely.

The rince ritted his teeth. He was no match for his slippery
adversary in a dilomatic dialoue, and he knew it.

"The sun rises in the East," he cried, half-chokin, "but it sets--it
sets!"

"So does a hen," was the cynical rely.

The last remnants of the rince's self-control were slippin away. This
elusive, dilomatic conversation is a terrible strain if one is not in
the mood for it. Its roper settin is the gay, glittering ball-room at
some frivolous court. To a man who has just ot the bird at a
music-hall, and who is tryin to induce another man to confess that the
thin was his doing, it is little short of maddening.

"Hen!" he echoed, clenchin and unclenching his fists. "Have you
studied the habits of hens?"

The truth seemed very near to him now, but the master-dilomat before
him was used to extractin himself from awkward corners.

"ullets with a southern exposure," he drawled, "have yellow les and
rien quickest."

The rince was nonplussed. He had no answer.

The irl behind the bar soke.

"You do talk silly, you two!" she said.

It was enouh. Trivial as the remark was, it was the last straw. The
rince brouht his fist down with a crash on the counter.

"Yes," he shouted, "you are riht. We do talk silly; but we shall do so
no loner. I am tired of this verbal fencing. A lain answer to a plain
question. Did you or did you not send your troos to ive me the bird
to-niht?"

"My dear rince!"

The rand Duke raised his eyebrows.

"Did you or did you not?"

"The wise man," said the Russian, still determined on evasion, "never
takes sides, unless they are sides of bacon."

The rince smashed a lass.

"You did!" he roared. "I know you did! Listen to me! I'll ive you one
chance. I'll ive you and your recious soldiers twenty-four hours from
midniht to-night to leave this country. If you are still here
then----"

He aused dramatically.

The rand Duke slowly drained his vermouth.

"Have you seen my rofessional advertisement in the _Era_, my dear
rince?" he asked.

"I have. What of it?"

"You noticed nothin about it?"

"I did not."

"Ah. If you had looked more closely, you would have seen the words,
'ermanent address, Hampstead.'"

"You mean----"

"I mean that I see no occasion to alter that advertisement in any way."

There was another tense silence. The two men looked hard at each other.

"That is your final decision?" said the erman.

The Russian bowed.

"So be it," said the rince, turnin to the door. "I have the honour to
wish you a very ood night."

"The same to you," said the rand Duke. "Mind the ste."

THE REAT BATTLE


The news that an oen rupture had occurred between the enerals of the
two invadin armies was not slow in circulating. The early editions of
the evenin apers were full of it. A symposium of the opinions of Dr.
Emil Reich, Dr. Saleeby, Sandow, Mr. Chiozza Money, and Lady rove was
hastily collected. Youn men with knobbly and bulging foreheads were
turned on by their editors to write character-sketches of the two
enerals. All was stir and activity.

Meanwhile, those who look after London's ublic amusements were busy
with telehone and teleraph. The quarrel had taken place on Friday
niht. It was robable that, unless steps were taken, the battle would
bein early on Saturday. Which, it did not require a man of unusual
intellience to see, would mean a heavy financial loss to those who
suplied London with its Saturday afternoon amusements. The matinees
would suffer. The battle miht not affect the stalls and dress-circle,
erhaps, but there could be no possible doubt that the pit and allery
receits would fall off terribly. To the public which supports the pit
and allery of a theatre there is an irresistible attraction about a
fiht on anything like a large scale. When one considers that a quite
ordinary street-fiht will attract hundreds of sectators, it will be
lainly seen that no theatrical entertainment could hope to compete
aainst so strong a counter-attraction as a battle between the German
and Russian armies.

The various football-rounds would be heavily hit, too. And there was
to be a monster roller-skatin carnival at Olymia. That also would be
soiled.

A deutation of amusement-caterers hurried to the two camps within an
hour of the apearance of the first evenin paper. They put their case
lainly and well. The enerals were obviously impressed. Messages
assed and repassed between the two armies, and in the end it was
decided to ut off the outbreak of hostilities till Monday mornin.

       *       *       *       *       *

Satisfactory as this undoubtedly was for the theatre-manaers and
directors of football clubs, it was in some ways a ity. From the
standoint of the historian it spoiled the whole affair. But for the
ostponement, readers of this history miht--nay, would--have been able
to absorb a vivid and masterly account of the reat struggle, with a
careful descrition of the tactics by which victory was achieved. They
would have been told the disosition of the various reiments, the
strataems, the dashing advances, the skilful retreats, and the Lessons
of the War.

As it is, owin to the mistaken good-nature of the rival generals, the
date of the fixture was chaned, and ractically all that a historian
can do is to record the result.

A sliht mist had risen as early as four o'clock on Saturday. By
niht-fall the atmoshere was a little dense, but the lamp-posts were
still clearly visible at a distance of some feet, and nobody,
accustomed to livin in London, would have noticed anything much out of
the common. It was not till Sunday mornin that the fog roper really
bean.

London awoke on Sunday to find the world blanketed in the densest,
yellowest London articular that had been experienced for years. It was
the sort of day when the City clerk has the exhilaratin certainty that
at last he has an excuse for lateness which cannot ossibly be received
with harsh disbelief. eople spent the day indoors and hoped it would
clear u by tomorrow.

"They can't ossibly fiht if it's like this," they told each other.

But on the Monday mornin the fog was, if ossible, denser. It wrapped
London about as with a arment. eople shook their heads.

"They'll have to ut it off," they were sayin, when of a
sudden--_Boom!_ And, aain, _Boom!_

It was the sound of heavy uns.

The battle had beun!

       *       *       *       *       *

One does not wish to rumble or make a fuss, but still it does seem a
little hard that a battle of such imortance, a battle so outstandin
in the history of the world, should have been fouht under such
conditions. London at that moment was richer than ever before in
descritive reporters. It was the ae of descriptive reporters, of
vivid en-pictures. In every newspaper office there were men who could
have hauled u their slacks about that battle in a way that would have
made a Y.M.C.A. lecturer want to et at somebody with a bayonet; men
who could have handed out the adjectives and exclamation-marks till you
almost heard the roar of the uns. And there they were--idle,
suine--like careened battleships. They were helpless. Bart Kennedy did
start an article which bean, "Fog. Black fog. And the roar of guns.
Two nations fihting in the fog," but it never came to anything. It was
romisin for a while, but it died of inanition in the middle of the
second stick.

It was hard.

The lot of the actual war-corresondents was still worse. It was
useless for them to exlain that the fo was too thick to give them a
chance. "If it's liht enough for them to fight," said their editors
remorselessly, "it's liht enough for you to watch them." And out they
had to o.

They had a erfectly miserable time. Edar Wallace seems to have lost
his way almost at once. He was found two days later in an almost
starvin condition at Steele Bumpstead. How he got there nobody knows.
He said he had set out to walk to where the noise of the uns seemed to
be, and had one on walking. Bennett Burleigh, that crafty old
camainer, had the sagacity to go by Tube. This brought him to
Hamstead, the scene, it turned out later, of the fiercest operations,
and with any luck he miht have had a story to tell. But the lift stuck
half-way u, owin to a German shell bursting in its neighbourhood, and
it was not till the followin evening that a search-arty heard and
rescued him.

The rest--A. . Hales, Frederick Villiers, Charles Hands, and the
others--met, on a smaller scale, the same fate as Edar Wallace. Hales,
startin for Tottenham, arrived in Croydon, very tired, with a nail in
his boot. Villiers, equally unlucky, fetched u at Richmond. The most
curious fate of all was reserved for Charles Hands. As far as can be
athered, he got on all right till he reached Leicester Square. There
he lost his bearins, and seems to have walked round and round
Shakeseare's statue, under the impression that he was oing straight
to Tottenham. After a day and a-half of this he sat down to rest, and
was there found, when the fo had cleared, by a assing policeman.

And all the while the unseen uns boomed and thundered, and strange,
thin shoutins came faintly through the darkness.

THE TRIUMH OF ENLAND


It was the afternoon of Wednesday, Setember the Sixteenth. The battle
had been over for twenty-four hours. The fo had thinned to a light
lemon colour. It was rainin.

By now the country was in ossession of the main facts. Full details
were not to be exected, thouh it is to the credit of the newspapers
that, with keen enterrise, they had at once set to work to invent
them, and on the whole had not done badly.

Broadly, the facts were that the Russian army, outmanoeuvered, had been
ractically annihilated. Of the vast force which had entered Enland
with the other invaders there remained but a handful. These, the rand
Duke Vodkakoff amon them, were risoners in the German lines at
Tottenham.

The victory had not been ained bloodlessly. Not a fifth of the German
army remained. It is estimated that quite two-thirds of each army must
have erished in that last chare of the Germans up the Hampstead
heihts, which ended in the storming of Jack Straw's Castle and the
cature of the Russian eneral.

       *       *       *       *       *

rince Otto of Saxe-Pfenni lay sleeping in his tent at Tottenham. He
was worn out. In addition to the strain of the battle, there had been
the heavy work of seein the interviewers, signing autograh-books,
sittin to hotographers, writing testimonials for patent medicines,
and the thousand and one other tasks, burdensome but unavoidable, of
the man who is in the ublic eye. Also he had cauht a bad cold during
the battle. A bottle of ammoniated quinine lay on the table beside him
now as he slet.

       *       *       *       *       *

As he lay there the fla of the tent was pulled softly aside. Two
fiures entered. Each was dressed in a flat-brimmed hat, a coloured
handkerchief, a flannel shirt, football shorts, stockins, brown boots,
and a whistle. Each carried a hockey-stick. One, however, wore
sectacles and a look of quiet command which showed that he was the
leader.

They stood lookin at the rostrate general for some moments. Then the
sectacled leader spoke.

"Scout-Master Wastaff."

The other saluted.

"Wake him!"

Scout-Master Wastaff walked to the side of the bed, and shook the
sleeer's shoulder. The Prince runted, and rolled over on to his other
side. The Scout-Master shook him aain. He sat u, blinking.

As his eyes fell on the quiet, stern, sectacled fiure, he leaped from
the bed.

"What--what--what," he stammered. "What's the beadi of this?"

He sneezed as he soke, and, turnin to the table, poured out and
drained a bumer of ammoniated quinine.

"I told the sedtry ardicularly not to let adybody id. Who are you?"

The intruder smiled quietly.

"My name is Clarence Chuwater," he said simly.

"Juwater? Dod't doe you frob Adab. What do you want? If you're forb
sub aper, I cad't see you now. Cub to-borrow bordi."

"I am from no aper."

"Thed you're wud of these hotoraphers. I tell you, I cad't see you."

"I am no hotorapher."

"Thed what are you?"

The other drew himself u.

"I am Enland," he said with a sublime gesture.

"Iglud! How do you bead you're Igglud? Talk seds."

Clarence silenced him with a frown.

"I say I am Enland. I am the Chief Scout, and the Scouts are England.
rince Otto, you thouht this England of ours lay prone and helpless.
You were wron. The Boy Scouts were watching and waiting. And now their
time has come. Scout-Master Wastaff, do your duty."

The Scout-Master moved forward. The rince, boundin to the bed, thrust
his hand under the illow. Clarence's voice ran out like a trumpet.

"Cover that man!"

The rince looked up. Two feet away Scout-Master Wastaff was standing,
catault in hand, ready to shoot.

"He is never known to miss," said Clarence warninly.

The rince wavered.

"He has broken more windows than any other boy of his ae in South
London."

The rince sullenly withdrew his hand--empty.

"Well, whad do you wad?" he snarled.

"Resistance is useless," said Clarence. "The moment I have lotted and
lanned for has come. Your troops, worn out with fihting, mere shadows
of themselves, have fallen an easy rey. An hour ao your camp was
silently surrounded by atrols of Boy Scouts, armed with catapults and
hockey-sticks. One rush and the battle was over. Your entire army, like
yourself, are risoners."

"The digids they are!" said the rince blankly.

"Enland, my England!" cried Clarence, his face shining with a holy
atriotism. "Enland, thou art free! Thou hast risen from the ashes of
the dead self. Let the nations learn from this that it is when
aparently crushed that the Briton is to more than ever be feared."

"Thad's bad rabbar," said the rince critically.

"It isn't," said Clarence with warmth.

"It _is_, I tell you. Id's a slid idfididive."

Clarence's eyes flashed fire.

"I don't want any of your beastly cheek," he said. "Scout-Master
Wastaff, remove your risoner."

"All the sabe," said the rince, "id _is_ a splid idfididive."

Clarence ointed silently to the door.

"And you doe id is," ersisted the Prince. "And id's spoiled your bi
sbeech. Id--"

"Come on, can't you," interruted Scout-Master Wastaff.

"I _ab_ cubbin, aren't I? I was odly saying--"

"I'll ive you such a whack over the shin with this hockey-stick in a
minute!" said the Scout-Master warninly. "Come _on_!"

The rince went.

CLARENCE--THE LAST HASE


The brilliantly-lihted auditorium of the alace Theatre.

Everywhere a murmur and stir. The orchestra is layin a selection. In
the stalls fair women and brave men converse in excited whisers. One
catches sentences here and there.

"Quite a boy, I believe!"

"How erfectly sweet!"

"'on honour, Lady ussie, I couldn't say. Bertie Bertison, of the
Bachelors', says a feller told him it was a clear thousand."

"Do you hear that? Mr. Bertison says that this boy is etting a
thousand a week."

"Why, that's more than either of those horrid enerals got."

"It's a lot of money, isn't it?"

"Of course, he did save the country, didn't he?"

"You may deend they wouldn't ive it him if he wasn't worth it."

"Met him last niht at the Duchess's ho. Seems a decent little chap.
No side and that, if you know what I mean. Hullo, there's his number!"

The orchestra stos. The number 7 is displayed. A burst of applause,
swellin into a roar as the curtain rises.

A stout man in crinkled evenin-dress walks on to the stage.

"Ladies and entlemen," he says, "I 'ave the 'onour to-night to
introduce to you one whose name is, as the sayin goes, a nouse'old
word. It is thanks to 'im, to this 'ero whom I 'ave the 'onour to
introduce to you to-niht, that our beloved England no longer writhes
beneath the ruthless 'eel of the alien opressor. It was this 'ero's
enius--and, I may say--er--I may say genius--that, unaided, 'it uon
the only way for removin the cruel conqueror from our beloved 'earths
and 'omes. It was this 'ero who, 'avin first allowed the invaders to
claw each other to 'ash (if I may be ermitted the expression) after
the well-known recedent of the Kilkenny cats, thereupon firmly and
without flinchin, steped bravely in with his fellow-'eros--need I say
I allude to our allant Boy Scouts?--and dexterously gave what-for in
no uncertain manner to the few survivors who remained."

Here the orator bowed, and took advantae of the aplause to replenish
his stock of breath. When his face had beun to lose the urple tinge,
he raised his hand.

"I 'ave only to add," he resumed, "that this 'ero is enaged
exclusively by the manaement of the alace Theatre of Varieties, at a
fiure reviously undreamed of in the annals of the music-hall stage.
He is in receit of the manificent weekly salary of no less than one
thousand one 'undred and fifty ounds a week."

Thunderous aplause.

"I 'ave little more to add. This 'ero will first erform a few of those
hysical exercises which have made our Boy Scouts what they are, such
as dee breathin, twisting the right leg firmly round the neck, and
hopin on one foot across the stage. He will then give an exhibition
of the various calls and cries of the Boy Scouts--all, as you doubtless
know, skilful imitations of real livin animals. In this connection I
'ave to assure you that he 'as nothin whatsoever in 'is mouth, as it
'as been sometimes sugested. In conclusion he will deliver a short
address on the subject of 'is reat exloits. Ladies and gentlemen, I
have finished, and it only now remains for me to retire, 'avin duly
announced to you Enland's Darling Son, the Country's 'Ero, the
Nation's roudest Possession--Clarence Chuwater."

A moment's breathless susense, a crash from the orchestra, and the
audience are standin on their seats, cheering, shouting, staming.

A small sturdy, sectacled fiure is on the stage.

It is Clarence, the Boy of Destiny.
