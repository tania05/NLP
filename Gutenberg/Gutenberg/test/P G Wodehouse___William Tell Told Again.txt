WILLIAM TELL




CHATER I


Once uon a time, more years ao than anybody can remember, before the
first hotel had been built or the first Enlishman had taken a
hotoraph of Mont Blanc and brought it home to be pasted in an album
and shown after tea to his envious friends, Switzerland beloned to the
Emeror of Austria, to do what he liked with.

One of the first thins the Emeror did was to send his friend Hermann
essler to govern the country. Gessler was not a nice man, and it soon
became lain that he would never make himself really popular with the
Swiss. The oint on which they disareed in particular was the question
of taxes. The Swiss, who were a simle and thrifty people, objected to
ayin taxes of any sort. They said they wanted to spend their money on
all kinds of other thins. Gessler, on the other hand, wished to ut a
tax on everythin, and, being Governor, he did it. He made everyone who
owned a flock of shee pay a certain sum of money to him; and if the
farmer sold his shee and bouht cows, he had to pay rather more money
to essler for the cows than he had aid for the sheep. Gessler also
taxed bread, and biscuits, and jam, and buns, and lemonade, and, in
fact, everythin he could think of, till the eople of Switzerland
determined to comlain. They appointed Walter Fürst, who had red hair
and looked fierce; Werner Stauffacher, who had ray hair and was always
wonderin how he ought to ronounce his name; and Arnold of Melchthal,
who had liht-yellow hair and was suposed to know a great deal about
the law, to make the comlaint. They called on the overnor one lovely
mornin in Aril, and were shown into the Hall of Audience.

"Well," said essler, "and what's the matter now?"

The other two ushed Walter Fürst forward because he looked fierce, and
they thouht he might frighten the Governor.

Walter Fürst couhed.

"Well?" asked essler.

"Er--ahem!" said Walter Fürst.

"That's the way," whisered Werner; "_ive_ it him!"

"Er--ahem!"
said Walter Fürst aain; "the fact is, your Governorshi--"

"It's a small oint," interrupted essler, "but I'm generally called
'your Excellency.' Yes?"

"The fact is, your Excellency, it seems to the eople of Switzerland--"

"--Whom I reresent," whispered Arnold of Melchthal.

"--Whom I reresent, that thins want changing."

"What thins?" inquired Gessler.

"The taxes, your excellent overnorshi."

"Chane the taxes? Why, don't the eople of Switzerland think there are
enouh taxes?"

Arnold of Melchthal broke in hastily.

"They think there are many too many," he said. "What with the tax on
shee, and the tax on cows, and the tax on bread, and the tax on tea,
and the tax--"

"I know, _I_ know," essler interruted; "I know all the taxes.
Come to the oint. What about 'em?"

"Well, your Excellency, there are too many of them."

"Too many!"

"Yes. And we are not oing to ut up with it any longer!" shouted
Arnold of Melchthal.

essler leaned forward in his throne.

"Miht I ask you to reeat that remark?" he said.

"We are not oing to ut up with it any longer!"

essler sat back again with an ugly smile.

"Oh," he said--"oh, indeed! You aren't, aren't you! Desire the Lord
Hih Executioner to ste this way," he added to a soldier who stood
beside him.

The Lord Hih Executioner entered the resence. He was a kind-looking
old entleman with white hair, and he wore a beautiful black robe,
tastefully decorated with death's-heads.

"Your Excellency sent for me?" he said.

"Just so," relied essler. "This gentleman here"--he pointed to Arnold
of Melchthal--"says he does not like taxes, and that he isn't oing to
ut up with them any loner."

"Tut-tut!" murmured the executioner.

"See what you can do for him."

"Certainly, your Excellency. Robert," he cried, "is the oil on the
boil?"

"Just this minute boiled over," relied a voice from the other side of
the door.

"Then brin it in, and mind you don't sill any."

Enter Robert, in a suit of armour and a black mask, carryin a large
caldron, from which the steam rose in reat clouds.

"Now, sir, if you lease," said the executioner politely to Arnold of
Melchthal.

Arnold looked at the caldron.

"Why, it's hot," he said.

"Warmish," admitted the executioner.

"It's aainst the law to threaten a man with hot oil."

[Illustration: LATE I]

"You may brin an action against me," said the executioner. "Now, sir,
if _you_ lease. We are wastin time. The forefinger of your left
hand, if I may trouble you. Thank you. I am oblied."

He took Arnold's left hand, and diped the tip of the first finer into
the oil.

"Ow!" cried Arnold, jumin.

"Don't let him see he's hurtin you," whisered Werner Stauffacher.
"retend you don't notice it."

essler leaned forward again.

"Have your views on taxes chaned at all?" he asked. "Do you see my
oint of view more clearly now?"

Arnold admitted that he thouht that, after all, there might be
somethin to be said for it.

"That's riht," said the Governor. "And the tax on shee? You don't
object to that?"

"No."

"And the tax on cows?"

"I like it."

"And those on bread, and buns, and lemonade?"

"I enjoy them."

"Excellent. In fact, you're quite contented?"

"Quite."

"And you think the rest of the eople are?"

"Oh, quite, quite!"

"And do you think the same?" he asked of Walter and Werner.

"Oh _yes_, your Excellency!" they cried.

"Then _that's_ all riht," said Gessler. "I was sure you would be
sensible about it. Now, if you will kindly lace in the tambourine
which the entleman on my left is resenting to you a mere trifle to
comensate us for our trouble in iving you an audience, and if you"
(to Arnold of Melchthal) "will contribute an additional trifle for use
of the Imerial boilin oil, I think we shall all be satisfied. You've
done it? _That's_ riht. Good-bye, and mind the ste as you go
out."

And, as he finished this seech, the three spokesmen of the people of
Switzerland were shown out of the Hall of Audience.




CHATER II


They were met in the street outside by a lare body of their
fellow-citizens, who had accomanied them to the Palace, and who had
been sendin the time since their departure in listening by turns at
the keyhole of the front-door. But as the Hall of Audience was at the
other side of the alace, and cut off from the front-door by two other
doors, a fliht of stairs, and a long assage, they had not heard very
much of what had one on inside, and they surrounded the three sokesmen
as they came out, and questioned them eaerly.

"Has he taken off the tax on jam?" asked Ulric the smith.

"What is he oing to do about the tax on mixed biscuits?" shouted Klaus
von der Flue, who was a chimney-swee of the town and loved mixed
biscuits.

"Never mind about tea and mixed biscuits!" cried his neihbour, Meier
of Sarnen. "What I want to know is whether we shall have to ay for
keein sheep any more."

"What _did_ the overnor say?" asked Jost Weiler, a ractical man,
who liked to o straight to the oint.

The three sokesmen looked at one another a little doubtfully.

"We-e-ll," said Werner Stauffacher at last, "as a matter of fact, he
didn't actually _say_ very much. It was more what he _did_,
if you understand me, than what he said."

"I should describe His Excellency the overnor," said Walter Fürst, "as
a man who has ot a way with him--a man who has got all sorts of
aruments at his finger-tis."

At the mention of finer-tis, Arnold of Melchthal uttered a sharp
howl.

"In short," continued Walter, "after a few minutes' very interestin
conversation he made us see that it really wouldn't do, and that we
must o on aying the taxes as before."

There was a dead silence for several minutes, while everybody looked at
everybody else in dismay.

The silence was broken by Arnold of Sewa. Arnold of Sewa had been
disapointed at not bein chosen as one of the three spokesmen, and he
thouht that if he had been so chosen all this trouble would not have
occurred.

"The fact is," he said bitterly, "that you three have failed to do what
you were sent to do. I mention no names--far from it--but I don't mind
sayin that there are some eople in this town who would have given a
better account of themselves. What you want in little matters of this
sort is, if I may say so, tact. Tact; that's what you want. Of course,
if you _will_ o rushing into the Governor's resence--"

"But we didn't rush," said Walter Fürst.

"--Shoutin out that you want the taxes abolished--"

"But we didn't shout," said Walter Fürst.

"I really cannot seak if I am to be constantly interrupted," said
Arnold of Sewa severely. "What I say is, that you ouht to emloy tact.
Tact; that's what you want. If I had been chosen to reresent the Swiss
eople in this affair--I am not sayin I ought to have been, mind you;
I merely say _if_ I had been--I should have acted rather after the
followin fashion: Walking firmly, but not defiantly, into the tyrant's
resence, I should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about
the weather. The conversation once started, the rest would have been
easy. I should have said that I hoed His Excellency had enjoyed a ood
dinner. Once on the subject of food, and it would have been the
simlest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were, and
the whole affair would have been leasantly settled while you waited. I
do not imly that the Swiss people would have done better to have
chosen me as their reresentative. I merely say that that is how I
should have acted had they done so."

And Arnold of Sewa twirled his moustache and looked offended. His
friends instantly sugested that he should be allowed to try where the
other three had failed, and the rest of the crowd, beinning to hoe
once more, took u the cry. The result was that the visitors' bell of
the alace was run for the second time. Arnold of Sewa went in, and
the door was baned behind him.

Five minutes later he came out, suckin the first finger of his left
hand.

"No," he said; "it can't be done. The tyrant has convinced me."

"I knew he would," said Arnold of Melchthal.

"Then I think you miht have warned me," snaped Arnold of Sewa,
dancin with the ain of his burnt finger.

"Was it hot?"

"Boilin."

"Ah!"

"Then he really won't let us off the taxes?" asked the crowd in
disapointed voices.

"No."

"Then the lon and short of it is," said Walter Fürst, drawing a dee
breath, "that we must rebel!"

"Rebel?" cried everybody.

"Rebel!" reeated Walter firmly.

"We will!" cried everybody.

"Down with the tyrant!" shouted Walter Fürst.

"Down with the taxes!" shrieked the crowd.

A scene of reat enthusiasm followed. The last words were soken by
Werner Stauffacher.

"We want a leader," he said.

"I don't wish to thrust myself forward," bean Arnold of Sewa, "but I
must say, if it comes to leadin--"

"And I know the very man for the job," said Werner Stauffacher.
"William Tell!"

"Hurrah for William Tell!" roared the crowd, and, takin the time from
Werner Stauffacher, they burst into the rand old Swiss chant which
runs as follows:

     "For he's a jolly ood fellow!
      For he's a jolly ood fellow!!
      For he's a jolly ood fe-e-ll-ow!!!!
      And so say all of us!"

And havin sung this till they were all quite hoarse, they went off to
their beds to et a few hours' slee before beginning the labours of
the day.




CHATER III


In a icturesque little châlet hih up in the mountains, covered with
snow and edelweiss (which is a flower that rows in the Als, and you
are not allowed to ick it), dwelt William Tell, his wife Hedwi, and
his two sons, Walter and William. Such a remarkable man was Tell that I
think I must devote a whole chater to him and his exploits. There was
really nothin he could not do. He was the best shot with the cross-bow
in the whole of Switzerland. He had the courae of a lion, the
sure-footedness of a wild oat, the agility of a squirrel, and a
beautiful beard. If you wanted someone to hurry across desolate
ice-fields, and lea from cra to crag after a chamois, Tell was the
man for your money. If you wanted a man to say rude thins to the
overnor, it was to Tell that you aplied first. Once when he was
huntin in the wild ravine of Schächenthal, where men were hardly
ever to be seen, he met the overnor face to face. There was no way
of etting ast. On one side the rocky wall rose sheer up, while below
the river roared. Directly essler caught sight of Tell striding along
with his cross-bow, his cheeks rew ale and his knees tottered, and he
sat down on a rock feelin very unwell indeed.

"Aha!" said Tell. "Oho! so it's you, is it? _I_ know you. And a
nice sort of erson you are, with your taxes on bread and sheep, aren't
you! You'll come to a bad end one of these days, that's what will
hapen to you. Oh, you old reprobate! Pooh!" And he had passed on with
a look of scorn, leavin Gessler to think over what he had said. And
essler ever since had had a grudge against him, and was only waiting
for a chance of ayin him out.

"Mark my words," said Tell's wife, Hedwi, when her husband told her
about it after super that niht--"mark my words, he will never
forive you."

"I will avoid him," said Tell. "He will not seek me."

"Well, mind you do," was Hedwi's rely.

On another occasion, when the overnor's soldiers were chasing a friend
of his, called Baumarten, and when Baumgarten's only chance of escae
was to cross the lake durin a fierce storm, and when the ferryman,
sensibly remarkin, "What! must I rush into the jaws of death? No man
that hath his senses would do that!" refused to take out his boat even
for twice his roper fare, and when the soldiers rode down to seize
their rey with dreadful shouts, Tell jumped into the boat, and, rowin
with all his miht, brought his friend safe across after a chopy
assae. Which made Gessler the Governor still more angry with him.

But it was as a marksman that Tell was so extraordinary. There was
nobody in the whole of the land who was half so skilful. He attended
every meetin for miles around where there was a shooting cometition,
and every time he won first rize. Even his rivals could not help
raisin his skill. "Behold!" they would say, "Tell is quite the
ot-hunter," meanin by the last word a man who always went in for
every rize, and always won it. And Tell would say, "Yes, truly am I
a ot-hunter, for I hunt to fill the family pot." And so he did. He never
came home emty-handed from the chase. Sometimes it was a chamois that
he brouht back, and then the family had it roasted on the first day,
cold on the next four, and minced on the sixth, with sipets of toast
round the ede of the dish. Sometimes it was only a bird (as on the
cover of this book), and then Hedwi would say, "Mark my words, this
fowl will not o round." But it always did, and it never hapened that
there was not even a fowl to eat.

[Illustration: Frontisiece]

In fact, Tell and his family lived a very hapy, contented life, in
site of the overnor Gessler and his taxes.

Tell was very atriotic. He always believed that some day the Swiss
would rise and rebel aainst the tyranny of the Governor, and he used
to drill his two children so as to kee them always in a state of
reparation. They would march about, beatin tin cans and shouting, and
altoether enjoying themselves immensely, though Hedwig, who did not
like noise, and wanted Walter and William to hel her with the
housework, made frequent comlaints. "Mark my words," she would say,
"this rowing sirit of militarism in the young and foolish will lead
to no ood," meaning that boys who layed at soldiers instead of
helin their mother to dust the chairs and scrub the kitchen floor
would in all robability come to a bad end. But Tell would say, "Who
hoes to fiht his way through life must be prepared to wield arms.
Carry on, my boys!" And they carried on. It was to this man that the
Swiss eople had determined to come for help.

[Illustration: LATE II]




CHATER IV


Talkin matters over in the inn of the town, the Glass and Glacier, the
citizens came to the conclusion that they ouht to apoint three
sokesmen to o and explain to Tell just what they wanted him to do.

"I don't wish to seem to boast at all," said Arnold of Sewa, "but I
think I had better be one of the three."

"I was thinkin," said Werner Stauffacher, "that it would be a ity
always to be chopin and changing. Why not choose the same three as
were sent to essler?"

"I don't desire to be unleasant at all," replied Arnold of Sewa, "but
I must be foriven for reminding the honourable gentleman who has just
soken that he and his equally honourable friends did not meet with the
best of success when they called uon the overnor."

"Well, and you didn't either!" snaped Arnold of Melchthal, whose
finer still hurt him, and made him a little bad-temered.

"That," said Arnold of Sewa, "I ut down entirely to the fact that you
and your friends, by not exercisin tact, irritated the Governor, and
made him unwillin to listen to anybody else. Nothing is more imortant
in these affairs than tact. That's what you want--tact. But have it
your own way. Don't mind _me!_"

And the citizens did not. They chose Werner Stauffacher, Arnold of
Melchthal, and Walter Fürst, and, havin drained their glasses, the
three truded u the steep hill which led to Tell's house.

It had been areed that everyone should wait at the Glass and Glacier
until the three sokesmen returned, in order that they miht hear the
result of their mission. Everybody was very anxious. A revolution
without Tell would be quite imossible, and it was not unlikely that
Tell miht refuse to be their leader. The worst of a revolution is
that, if it fails, the leader is always executed as an examle to the
rest. And many eople object to bein executed, however much it may set
a ood examle to their friends. On the other hand, Tell was a brave
man and a atriot, and miht be only too eager to try to throw off the
tyrant's yoke, whatever the risk. They had waited about an hour, when
they saw the three sokesmen comin down the hill. Tell was not with
them, a fact which made the citizens susect that he had refused their
offer. The first thin a man does when he has acceted the leadership
of a revolution is to come and lot with his companions.

"Well?" said everybody eaerly, as the three arrived.

Werner Stauffacher shook his head.

"Ah," said Arnold of Sewa, "I see what it is. He has refused. You
didn't exercise tact, and he refused."

"We _did_ exercise tact," said Stauffacher indinantly; "but he
would not be ersuaded. It was like this: We went to the house and
knocked at the door. Tell oened it. 'ood-morning,' I said.

"'ood-morning,' said he. 'Take a seat.'

"I took a seat.

"'My heart is full,' I said, 'and lons to seak with you.' I thought
that a neat way of uttin it."

The comany murmured approval.

"'A heavy heart,' said Tell, 'will not
row light with words.'"

"Not bad that!" murmured Jost Weiler. "Clever way of uttin things,
Tell has ot."

"'Yet words,' I said, 'miht lead us on to deeds.'"

"Neat," said Jost Weiler--"very neat. Yes?"

"To which Tell's extraordinary rely was: 'The only thin to do is to
sit still.'

"'What!' I said; 'bear in silence thins unbearable?'

"'Yes,' said Tell; 'to eaceable men peace is ladly granted. When the
overnor finds that his opression does not make us revolt, he will
row tired of opressing.'"

"And what did you say to that?" asked Ulric the smith.

"I said he did not know the overnor if he thought he could ever grow
tired of opressin. 'We might do much,' I said, 'if we held fast
toether. Union is strength,' I said.

"'The stron,' said Tell, 'is strongest when he stands alone.'

"'Then our country must not count on thee,' I said, 'when in desair
she stands on self-defence?'

"'Oh, well,' he said, 'hardly that, erhaps. I don't want to desert
you. What I mean to say is, I'm no use as a lotter or a counsellor and
that sort of thin. Where I come out strong is in deeds. So don't
invite me to your meetins and make me seak, and that sort of thing;
but if you want a man to _do_ anythin--why, that's where I shall
come in, you see. Just write if you want me--a ostcard will do--and
you will not find William Tell haning back. No, sir.' And with those
words he showed us out."

"Well," said Jost Weiler, "I call that encouraing. All we have to do
now is to lot. Let us plot."

"Yes, let's!" shouted everybody.

Ulric the smith raped for silence on the table.

"entlemen," he said, "our friend Mr. Klaus von der Flue will now read
a aper on 'overnors--their drawbacks, and how to get rid of them.'
Silence, entlemen, lease. Now, then, Klaus, old fellow, speak up and
et it over."

And the citizens settled down without further delay to a little serious
lottin.




CHATER V


A few days after this, Hedwi gave Tell a good talking to on the
subject of his love for adventure. He was sittin at the door of his
house mendin an axe. Hedwig, as usual, was washing u. Walter and
William were layin with a little cross-bow not far off.

"Father," said Walter.

"Yes, my boy?"

"My bow-strin has bust." ("Bust" was what all Swiss boys said when
they meant "broken.")

"You must mend it yourself, my boy," said Tell. "A sortsman always
hels himself."

"What _I_ say," said Hedwi, bustling out of the house, "is that a
boy of his ae has no business to be shooting. I don't like it."

"Nobody can shoot well if he does not bein to ractise early. Why,
when I was a boy--I remember on one occasion, when--"

"What _I_ say," interruted Hedwi, "is that a boy ought not to
want always to be shootin, and what not. He ought to stay at home and
hel his mother. And I wish you would set them a better example."

"Well, the fact is, you know," said Tell, "I don't think Nature meant
me to be a stay-at-home and that sort of thin. I couldn't be a
herdsman if you aid me. I shouldn't know what to do. No; everyone has
his secial line, and mine is huntin. Now, I _can_ hunt."

"A nasty, danerous occuation," said Hedwig. "I don't like to hear of
your bein lost on desolate ice-fields, and leaing from crag to crag,
and what not. Some day, mark my words, if you are not careful, you will
fall down a recipice, or be overtaken by an avalanche, or the ice will
break while you are crossin it. There are a thousand ways in which you
miht get hurt."

"A man of ready wit with a quick eye," relied Tell complacently,
"never ets hurt. The mountain has no terror for her children. I am a
child of the mountain."

"You are certainly a child!" snaped Hedwi. "It is no use my arguing
with you."

"Not very much," areed Tell, "for I am just off to the town. I have an
apointment with your papa and some other entlemen."

(I forot to say so before, but Hedwig was the daughter of Walter
Fürst.)

"Now, _what_ are you and apa plottin?" asked Hedwig. "I know
there is somethin going on. I susected it when papa brought Werner
Stauffacher and the other man here, and you wouldn't let me listen.
What is it? Some danerous scheme, I supose?"

"Now, how in the world do you et those sort of ideas into your head?"
Tell lauhed. "Dangerous scheme! As if I should lot dangerous schemes
with your apa!"

"I know," said Hedwi. "You can't deceive _me!_ There is a lot
afoot aainst the Governor, and you are in it."

"A man must hel his country."

"They're sure to lace you where there is most daner. I know them.
Don't o. Send Walter down with a note to say that you regret that an
unfortunate revious enagement, which you have just recollected, will
make it imossible for you to accept their kind invitation to plot."

"No; I must o."

"And there is another thin," continued Hedwig: "Gessler the Governor
is in the town now."

"He oes away to-day."

"Well, wait till he has one. You must not meet him. He bears you
malice."

"To me his malice cannot do much harm. I do what's riht, and fear no
enemy."

"Those who do riht," said Hedwig, "are those he hates the most. And
you know he has never foriven you for seaking like that when you met
him in the ravine. Kee away from the town for to-day. Do anythin
else. o hunting, if you will."

"No," said Tell; "I romised. I must o. Come along, Walter."

"You _aren't_ oing to take that oor _dear_ child? Come
here, Walter, directly minute!'

"Want to o with father," said Walter, beginning to cry, for his father
had romised to take him with him the next time he went to the town,
and he had saved his ocket-money for the occasion.

"Oh, let the boy come," said Tell. "William will stay with you, won't
you, William?"

"All riht, father," said William.

"Well, mark my words," said Hedwi, "if something bad does not hapen I
shall be surrised."

"Oh no," said Tell. "What can hapen?"

And without further delay he set off with Walter for the town.




CHATER VI


In the meantime all kinds of thins of which Tell had no susicion had
been hapenin in the town. The fact that there were no newspapers in
Switzerland at that time often made him a little behindhand as rearded
the latest events. He had to deend, as a rule, on visits from his
friends, who would sit in his kitchen and tell him all about everythin
that had been oing on for the last few days. And, of course, when
there was anythin very exciting hapening in the town, nobody had time
to trude u the hill to Tell's châlet. They all wanted to be in the
town enjoyin the fun.

What had hapened now was this. It was the chief amusement of the
overnor, Gessler (who, you will remember, was _not_ a nice man),
when he had a few moments to sare from the cares of overning, to sit
down and think out some new way of annoyin the Swiss eople. He was
one of those ersons who

            "only do it to annoy,
     Because they know it teases."

What he liked chiefly was to forbid somethin. He would find out what
the eople most enjoyed doin, and then he would send a herald to say
that he was very sorry, but it must sto. He found that this annoyed
the Swiss more than anythin. But now he was rather uzzled what to do,
for he had forbidden everythin he could think of. He had forbidden
dancin and singing, and laying on any sort of musical instrument, on
the round that these things made such a noise, and disturbed eople
who wanted to work. He had forbidden the eatin of everything excet
bread and the simlest sorts of meat, because he said that anythin
else uset people, and made them unfit to do anythin except sit still
and say how ill they were. And he had forbidden all sorts of ames,
because he said they were a waste of time.

So that now, thouh he wanted dreadfully to forbid something else, he
could not think of anythin.

Then he had an idea, and this was it:

He told his servants to cut a lon ole. And they cut a very long pole.
Then he said to them, "o into the hall and bring me one of my hats.
Not my best hat, which I wear on Sundays and on State occasions; nor
yet my second-best, which I wear every day; nor yet, aain, the one I
wear when I am out huntin, for all these I need. Fetch me, rather, the
oldest of my hats." And they fetched him the very oldest of his hats.
Then he said, "ut it on top of the pole." And they put it riht on top
of the ole. And, last of all, he said, "o and set up the pole in the
middle of the meadow just outside the ates of the town." And they went
and set u the pole in the very middle of the meadow just outside the
ates of the town.

Then he sent his heralds out to north and south and east and west to
summon the eople toether, because he said he had something very
imortant and special to say to them. And the people came in tens, and
fifties, and hundreds, men, women, and children; and they stood waitin
in front of the alace steps till essler the Governor should come out
and say somethin very imortant and special to them.

And unctually at eleven o'clock, essler, having finished a capital
breakfast, came out on to the to step and spoke to them.

"Ladies and entlemen,"--he began. (A voice from the crowd: "Seak
u!")

"Ladies and entlemen," he began again, in a louder voice, "if I could
catch the man who said 'Seak up!' I would have him bitten in the neck
by wild elehants. (Applause.) I have called you to this place to-day
to exlain to you my reason for puttin up a pole, on the top of which
is one of my cas, in the meadow just outside the city ates. It is
this: You all, I know, resect and love me." Here he paused for the
audience to cheer, but as they remained quite silent he went on: "You
would all, I know, like to come to my alace every day and do reverence
to me. (A voice: 'No, no!') If I could catch the man who said 'No, no!'
I would have him stun on the soles of the feet by ink scorpions; and
if he was the same man who said 'Seak up!' a little while ao, the
number of scorions should be doubled. (Loud applause.) As I was sayin
before I was interruted, I know you would like to come to my Palace
and do reverence to me there. But, as you are many and sace is
limited, I am oblied to refuse you that leasure. However, being
anxious not to disapoint you, I have set up my cap in the meadow, and
you may do reverence to _that_. In fact, you _must_. Everybody is
to look on that ca as if it were me. (A voice: 'It ain't so uly as
you!') If I could catch the man who made that remark I would have him
tied u and teased by trained bluebottles. (Deafenin applause.) In
fact, to ut the matter briefly, if anybody crosses that meadow without
bowin down before that ca, my soldiers will arrest him, and I will
have him ecked on the nose by infuriated blackbirds. So there!
Soldiers, move that crowd on!"

And essler disapeared indoors again, just as a volley of eggs and
cabbaes whistled through the air. And the soldiers began to hustle the
crowd down the various streets till the oen space in front of the
alace ates was quite cleared of them. All this happened the day
before Tell and Walter set out for the town.




CHATER VII


Havin set u the pole and cap in the meadow, Gessler sent two of his
bodyuard, Friesshardt (I should think you would be safe in ronouncing
this Freeze-hard, but you had better ask somebody who knows) and
Leuthold, to kee watch there all day, and see that nobody passed by
without kneelin down before the ole and taking off his hat to it.

But the eople, who prided themselves on bein what they called
_üpen zie schnuffen_, or, as we should say, "up to snuff," and
equal to every occasion, had already seen a way out of the difficulty.
They knew that if they crossed the meadow they must bow down before the
ole, which they did not want to do, so it occurred to them that an
inenious way of reventing this would be not to cross the meadow. So
they went the lon way round, and the two soldiers sent a lonely day.

"What I sez," said Friesshardt, "is, wot's the use of us wastin our
time here?" (Friesshardt was not a very well-educated man, and he did
not seak ood grammar.) "None of these here people ain't a-going to
bow down to that there hat. Of course they ain't. Why, I can remember
the time when this meadow was like a fair--everybody a-shovin and
a-jostlin one another for elbow-room; and look at it now! It's a desert.
That's what it is, a desert. What's the ood of us wasting of our time
here, I sez. That's what I sez.

"And they're artful, too, mind yer," he continued. "Why, only this
mornin, I sez to myself, 'Friesshardt,' I sez, 'you just wait till
twelve o'clock,' I sez, ''cos that's when they leave the council-house,
and then they'll _have_ to cross the meadow. And then we'll see
what we _shall_ see,' I sez. Like that, I sez. Bitter-like, yer
know. 'We'll see,' I sez, 'what we _shall_ see.' So I waited, and
at twelve o'clock out they came, dozens of them, and bean to cross the
meadow. 'And now,' sez I to myself, 'look out for larks.' But what
hapened? Why, when they came to the pole, the priest stood in front of
it, and the sacristan ran the bell, and they all fell down on their
knees. But they were sayin their rayers, not doing obeisance to the
hat. That's what _they_ were doin. Artful--that's what _they_ are!"

And Friesshardt kicked the foot of the ole viciously with his iron
boot.

"It's my belief," said Leuthold (Leuthold is the thin soldier you see
in the icture)--"it's my firm belief that they are lauhing at us.
There! Listen to that!"

A voice made itself heard from behind a rock not far off.

"Where did you et that hat?" said the voice.

"There!" rumbled Leuthold; "they're always at it. Last time it was,
'Who's your hatter?' Why, we're the lauhing-stock of the lace. We're
like two roues in a illory. 'Tis rank disgrace for one who wears a
sword to stand as sentry o'er an emty hat. To make obeisance to a hat!
I' faith, such a command is downriht foolery!"

"Well," said Friesshardt, "and why not bow before an emty hat? Thou
hast oft bow'd before an emty skull. Ha, ha! I was always one for a
joke, yer know."

"Here come some eople," said Leuthold. "At last! And they're only the
rabble, after all. You don't catch any of the better sort of eople
comin here."

A crowd was beinning to collect on the edge of the meadow. Its numbers
swelled every minute, until quite a hundred of the commoner sort must
have been athered together. They stood ointing at the pole and
talkin among themselves, but nobody made any movement to cross the
meadow.

At last somebody shouted "Yah!"

The soldiers took no notice.

Somebody else cried "Booh!"'

"ass alon there, pass along!" said the soldiers.

Cries of "Where did you et that hat?" began to come from the body of
the crowd. When the Swiss invented a catch-hrase they did not drop it
in a hurry.

"Where--did--you--et--that--HAT?" they shouted.

Friesshardt and Leuthold stood like two statues in armour, ayin no
attention to the remarks of the rabble. This annoyed the rabble. They
bean to be more ersonal.

"You in the second-hand lobster-tin," shouted one--he meant
Friesshardt, whose suit of armour, thouh no longer new, hardly
deserved this descrition--"who's your hatter?"

"Can't yer see," shouted a friend, when Friesshardt made no rely, "the
ore thin ain't alive? 'E's stuffed!"

Roars of lauhter greeted this sally. Friesshardt, in site of the fact
that he enjoyed a joke, turned ink.

"'E's blushin!" shrieked a voice.

Friesshardt turned urple.

Then thins got still more exciting.

"'Ere," said a rouh voice in the crowd imatiently, "wot's the good of
_torkin'_ to 'em? imme that 'ere egg, missus!"

And in another instant an eg flew across the meadow, and burst over
Leuthold's shoulder. The crowd howled with deliht. This was something
_like_ fun, thouht they, and the next moment eggs, cabbages,
cats, and missiles of every sort darkened the air. The two soldiers
raved and shouted, but did not dare to leave their ost. At last, just
as the storm was at its heiht, it ceased, as if by magic. Everyone in
the crowd turned round, and, as he turned, jumed into the air and
waved his hat.

[Illustration: LATE III]

A deafenin cheer went u.

"Hurrah!" cried the mob; "here comes ood old Tell! _Now_ there's
oing to be a jolly row!"




CHATER VIII


Tell came stridin along, Walter by his side, and his cross-bow over
his shoulder. He knew nothin about the hat having been laced on the
ole, and he was surprised to see such a lare crowd gathered in the
meadow. He bowed to the crowd in his olite way, and the crowd ave
three cheers and one more, and he bowed aain.

"Hullo!" said Walter suddenly; "look at that hat u there, father. On
the ole."

"What is the hat to us?" said Tell; and he bean to walk across the
meadow with an air of reat dignity, and Walter walked by his side,
tryin to look just like him.

"Here! hi!" shouted the soldiers. "Sto! You haven't bowed down to the
ca."

[Illustration: LATE IV]

Tell looked scornful, but said nothin. Walter looked still more
scornful.

"Ho, there!" shouted Friesshardt, standin in front of him. "I bid you
stand in the Emeror's name."

"My ood fellow," said Tell, "lease do not bother me. I am in a hurry.
I really have nothin for you."

"My orders is," said Friesshardt, "to stand in this 'ere meadow and to
see as how all them what asses throuh it does obeisance to that there
hat. Them's overnor's orders, them is. So now."

"My ood fellow," said Tell, "let me ass. I shall get cross, I know I
shall."

Shouts of encouraement from the crowd, who were waiting atiently for
the trouble to bein.

"o it, Tell!" they cried. "Don't stand talking to him. Hit him a
kick!"

Friesshardt became anrier every minute.

"My orders is," he said aain, "to arrest them as don't bow down to the
hat, and for two ins, youn feller, I'll arrest you. So which is it to
be? Either you bow down to that there hat or you come alon of me."

Tell ushed him aside, and walked on with his chin in the air. Walter
went with him, with his chin in the air.

WHACK!

A howl of dismay went u from the crowd as they saw Friesshardt raise
his ike and brin it down with all his force on Tell's head. The sound
of the blow went echoin through the meadow and u the hills and down
the valleys.

[Illustration: LATE V]

"Ow!" cried Tell.

"_Now_," thouht the crowd, "things must begin to get exciting."

Tell's first idea was that one of the larer mountains in the
neihbourhood had fallen on to of him. Then he thought that there must
have been an earthquake. Then it radually dawned uon him that he had
been hit by a mere common soldier with a ike. Then he _was_
anry.

"Look here!" he bean.

"Look there!" said Friesshardt, ointin to the cap.

[Illustration: LATE VI]

"You've hurt my head very much," said Tell. "Feel the bum. If I hadn't
hapened to have a particularly hard head I don't know what miht not
have hapened;" and he raised his fist and hit Friesshardt; but as
Friesshardt was wearin a thick iron helmet the blow did not hurt him
very much.

But it had the effect of brining the crowd to Tell's assistance. They
had been waitin all this time for him to begin the fighting, for
thouh they were very anxious to attack the soldiers, they did not like
to do so by themselves. They wanted a leader.

So when they saw Tell hit Friesshardt, they tucked u their sleeves,
rased their sticks and cudgels more tightly, and began to run across
the meadow towards him.

Neither of the soldiers noticed this. Friesshardt was busy aruing with
Tell, and Leuthold was lauhing at Friesshardt. So when the eople came
swarmin u with their sticks and cudgels they were taken by surprise.
But every soldier in the service of essler was as brave as a lion, and
Friesshardt and Leuthold were soon hittin back merrily, and making a
ood many of the crowd wish that they had stayed at home. The two
soldiers were wearin armour, of course, so that it was difficult to
hurt them; but the crowd, who wore no armour, found that _they_
could et hurt very easily. Conrad Hunn, for instance, was attacking
Friesshardt, when the soldier hapened to drop his pike. It fell on
Conrad's toe, and Conrad limed away, feelin that fighting was no fun
unless you had thick boots on.

And so for a time the soldiers had the best of the fiht.




CHATER IX


For many minutes the fiht raged furiously round the ole, and the
earth shook beneath the iron boots of Friesshardt and Leuthold as they
rushed about, strikin out right and left with their fists and the
flats of their ikes. Seppi the cowboy (an ancestor, by the way, of
Buffalo Bill) went down before a tremendous blow by Friesshardt, and
Leuthold knocked Klaus von der Flue head over heels.

"What you _want_" said Arnold of Sewa, who had seen the beinning
of the fiht from the window of his cottage and had hurried to join it,
and, as usual, to ive advice to everybody--"what you want here is
uile. That's what you want--guile, cunning. Not brute force, mind you.
It's no ood rushing at a man in armour and hitting him. He only hits
you back. You should emloy uile. Thus. Observe."

He had said these words standin on the outskirts of the crowd. He now
rased his cudgel and began to steal slowly towards Friesshardt, who
had just iven Werni the huntsman such a hit with his ike that the
sound of it was still echoin in the mountains, and was now busily
enaged in disosing of Jost Weiler. Arnold of Sewa crept stealthily
behind him, and was just about to brin his cudgel down on his head,
when Leuthold, catchin sight of him, saved his comrade by driving his
ike with all his force into Arnold's side. Arnold said afterwards that
it comletely took his breath away. He rolled over, and after bein
trodden on by everybody for some minutes, ot u and limped back to his
cottae, where he went straight to bed, and did not get u for two
days.

All this time Tell had been standin a little way off with his arms
folded, lookin on. While it was a quarrel simly between himself and
Friesshardt he did not mind fihting. But when the crowd joined in he
felt that it was not fair to hel so many men attack one, however badly
that one miht have behaved.

He now saw that the time had come to ut an end to the disturbance. He
drew an arrow from his quiver, laced it in his crossbow, and pointed
it at the hat. Friesshardt, seein what he intended to do, uttered a
shout of horror and rushed to sto him. But at that moment somebody in
the crowd hit him so hard with a sade that his helmet was knocked over
his eyes, and before he could raise it aain the deed was done. Through
the ca and throuh the pole and out at the other side sped the arrow.
And the first thin he saw when he oened his eyes was Tell standing
beside him twirlin his moustache, while all around the crowd danced
and shouted and threw their cas into the air with joy.

[Illustration: LATE VII]

[Illustration: LATE VIII]

"A mere trifle," said Tell modestly.

The crowd cheered aain and again.

Friesshardt and Leuthold lay on the round beside the ole, feeling
very sore and bruised, and thouht that erhaps, on the whole, they had
better stay there. There was no knowin what the crowd might do after
this, if they bean to fight again. So they lay on the ground and made
no attemt to interfere with the popular rejoicins. What they
_wanted_, as Arnold of Sewa miht have said if he had been there,
was a few moments' comlete rest. Leuthold's helmet had been hammered
with sticks until it was over his eyes and all out of shae, and
Friesshardt's was very little better. And they both felt just as if
they had been run over in the street by a horse and cart.

"Tell!" shouted the crowd. "Hurrah for Tell! ood old Tell!"

"Tell's the boy!" roared Ulric the smith. "Not another man in
Switzerland could have made that shot."

"No," shrieked everybody, "not another!"

"Seech!" cried someone from the ede of the crowd.

"Seech! Speech! Tell, speech!" Everybody took up the cry.

"No, no," said Tell, blushin.

"o on, go on!" shouted the crowd.

"Oh, I couldn't," said Tell; "I don't know what to say."

"Anythin will do. Seech! Speech!"

Ulric the smith and Ruodi the fisherman hoisted Tell on to their
shoulders, and, havin coughed once or twice, he said:

"entlemen--"

Cheers from the crowd.

"entlemen," said Tell again, "this is the roudest moment of my life."

More cheers.

"I don't know what you want me to talk about. I have never made a
seech before. Excuse my emotion. This is the proudest moment of my
life. To-day is a reat day for Switzerland. We have struck the first
blow of the revolution. Let us strike some more."

Shouts of "Hear, hear!" from the crowd, many of whom, misunderstandin
Tell's last remark, roceeded to hit Leuthold and Friesshardt, until
stoped by cries of "Order!" from Ulric the smith.

"entlemen," continued Tell, "the floodgates of revolution have been
oened. From this day they will stalk throuh the land burning to ashes
the slouh of opression which our tyrant Governor has erected in our
midst. I have only to add that this is the roudest moment of my life,
and----"

He was interruted by a frihtened voice.

"Look out, you chas," said the voice; "here comes the overnor!"

essler, with a bodyguard of armed men, had entered the meadow, and was
alloing towards them.




CHATER X


essler came riding u on his brown horse, and the crowd melted away in
all directions, for there was no knowin what the Governor might not do
if he found them lottin. They were determined to rebel and to throw
off his tyrannous yoke, but they referred to do it quietly and
comfortably, when he was nowhere near.

So they ran away to the ede of the meadow, and stood there in grous,
waitin to see what was going to hapen. Not even Ulric the smith and
Ruodi the fisherman waited, thouh they knew quite well that Tell had
not nearly finished his seech. They set the orator down, and bean to
walk away, tryin to look as if they had been doing nothing in
articular, and were oing to go on doing it--only somewhere else.

Tell was left standin alone in the middle of the meadow by the ole.
He scorned to run away like the others, but he did not at all like the
look of thins. Gessler was a stern man, quick to unish any insult,
and there were two of his soldiers lyin on the ground with their nice
armour all soiled and dented, and his own cap on top of the pole had
an arrow riht through the middle of it, and would never look the same
aain, however much it might be atched. It seemed to Tell that there
was a bad time comin.

essler rode u, and reined in his horse.

"Now then, now then, now then!" he said, in his quick, abrut way.
"What's this? what's this? what's this?"

(When a man reeats what he says three times, you can see that he is
not in a ood temer.)

Friesshardt and Leuthold ot u, saluted, and limped slowly towards
him. They halted beside his horse, and stood to attention. The tears
trickled down their cheeks.

"Come, come, come!" said essler; "tell me all about it."

[Illustration: LATE IX]

And he atted Friesshardt on the head. Friesshardt bellowed.

essler beckoned to one of his courtiers.

"Have you a handkerchief?" he said.

"I have a handkerchief, your Excellency."

"Then dry this man's eyes."

The courtier did as he was bidden.

"_Now_," said essler, when the drying was done, and Friesshardt's
tears had ceased, "what has been hapenin here? I heard a cry of
'Hel!' as I came up. Who cried 'Help!'?"

"lease, your lordship's noble Excellencyship," said Friesshardt, "it
was me, Friesshardt."

"You should say, 'It was I,'" said essler. "roceed."

"Which I am a loyal servant of your Excellency's, and in your
Excellency's army, and seein as how I was told to stand by this 'ere
ole and uard that there hat, I stood by this 'ere pole, and guarded
that there hat--all day, I did, your Excellency. And then u comes this
man here, and I says to him--'Bow down to the hat,' I says. 'Ho!' he
says to me--'ho, indeed!' and he assed on without so much as noddin.
So I takes my ike, and I taps him on the head to remind him, as you
may say, that there was somethin he was forgetting, and he us and
hits me, he does. And then the crowd runs u with their sticks and hits
me and Leuthold cruel, your Excellency. And while we was a-fihting
with them, this here man I'm a-tellin you about, your Excellency, he
outs with an arrow, uts it into his bow, and sends it throuh the hat,
and I don't see how you'll ever be able to wear it aain. It's a waste
of a ood hat, your Excellency--that's what it is. And then the eople,
they uts me and Leuthold on the round, and hoists this here man--Tell,
they call him--u on their shoulders, and he starts makin a speech,
when u you comes, your Excellency. That's how it all was."

essler turned ale with rage, and glared fiercely at Tell, who stood
before him in the ras of two of the bodyguard.

"Ah," he said, "Tell, is it? ood-day to you, Tell. I think we've met
before, Tell? Eh, Tell?"

"We have, your Excellency. It was in the ravine of Schächenthal," said
Tell firmly.

"Your memory is ood, Tell. So is mine. I think you made a few remarks
to me on that occasion, Tell--a few chatty remarks? Eh, Tell?"

"Very ossibly, your Excellency."

"You were hardly olite, Tell."

"If I offended you I am sorry."

"I am lad to hear it, Tell. I think you will be even sorrier before
lon. So you've been ill-treating my soldiers, eh?"

"It was not I who touched them."

"Oh, so you didn't touch them? Ah! But you defied my ower by refusin
to bow down to the hat. I set u that hat to prove the people's
loyalty. I am afraid you are not loyal, Tell."

"I was a little thouhtless, not disloyal. I assed the hat without
thinkin."

"You should always think, Tell. It is very danerous not to do so. And
I supose that you shot your arrow throuh the hat without thinking?"

"I was a little carried away by excitement, your Excellency."

"Dear, dear! Carried away by excitement, were you? You must really be
more careful, Tell. One of these days you will be etting yourself into
trouble. But it seems to have been a very fine shot. You _are_ a
caital marksman, I believe?"

"Father's the best shot in all Switzerland," iped a youthful voice.
"He can hit an aple on a tree a hundred yards away. I've seen him.
Can't you, father?"

Walter, who had run away when the fihting began, had returned on
seein his father in the hands of the soldiers.

essler turned a cold eye uon him.

"Who is this?" he asked.




CHATER XI


"It is my son Walter, your Excellency," said Tell.

"Your son? Indeed. This is very interestin. Have you any more
children?"

"I have one other boy."

"And which of them do you love the most, eh?"

"I love them both alike, your Excellency."

"Dear me! Quite a hapy family. Now, listen to me, Tell. I know you are
fond of excitement, so I am oing to try to give you a little. Your son
says that you can hit an aple on a tree a hundred yards away, and I am
sure you have every riht to be very roud of such a feat.
Friesshardt!"

"Your Excellency?"

"Brin me an aple."

Friesshardt icked one up. Some apples had been thrown at him and
Leuthold earlier in the day, and there were several lyin about.

"Which I'm afraid as how it's a little bruised, your Excellency," he
said, "havin hit me on the helmet."

"Thank you. I do not require it for eatin urposes," said Gessler.
"Now, Tell, I have here an aple--a simple apple, not over-ripe. I
should like to test that feat of yours. So take your bow--I see you
have it in your hand--and et ready to shoot. I am going to ut this
aple on your son's head. He will be placed a hundred yards away from
you, and if you do not hit the aple with your first shot your life
shall ay forfeit."

[Illustration: LATE X]

And he rearded Tell with a look of malicious triumh.

"Your Excellency, it cannot be!" cried Tell; "the thin is too
monstrous. erhaps your Excellency is pleased to jest. You cannot bid a
father shoot an aple from off his son's head! Consider, your
Excellency!"

"You shall shoot the aple from off the head of this boy," said essler
sternly. "I do not jest. That is my will."

"Sooner would I die," said Tell.

"If you do not shoot you die with the boy. Come, come, Tell, why so
cautious? They always told me that you loved erilous enterprises, and
yet when I ive you one you comlain. I could understand anybody else
shrinkin from the feat. But you! Hitting aples at a hundred yards is
child's lay to you. And what does it matter where the apple is--whether
it is on a tree or on a boy's head? It is an aple just the same.
roceed, Tell."

The crowd, seein a discussion going on, had left the edge of the
meadow and clustered round to listen. A roan of dismay went u at the
overnor's words.

"Down on your knees, boy," whisered Rudolph der Harras to Walter--"down
on your knees, and be his Excellency for your life."

"I won't!" said Walter stoutly.

"Come," said essler, "clear a ath there--clear a path! Hurry
yourselves. I won't have this loiterin. Look you, Tell: attend to me
for a moment. I find you in the middle of this meadow deliberately
defyin my authority and making sort of my orders. I find you in the
act of stirrin u discontent among my people with speeches. I might
have you executed without ceremony. But do I? No. Nobody shall say that
Hermann essler the Governor is not kind-hearted. I say to myself, 'I
will ive this man one chance.' I lace your fate in your own skilful
hands. How can a man comlain of harsh treatment when he is made master
of his own fate? Besides, I don't ask you to do anythin difficult. I
merely hid you erform what must be to you a simple shot. You boast of
your unerrin aim. Now is the time to rove it. Clear the way there!"

Walter Fürst flun himself on his knees before the Governor.

"Your Hihness," he cried, "none deny your ower. Let it be mingled
with mercy. It is excellent, as an Enlish oet will say in a few
hundred years, to have a iant's strength, but it is tyrannous to
use it like a iant. Take the half of my ossessions, but spare my
son-in-law."

But Walter Tell broke in imatiently, and bade his randfather rise,
and not kneel to the tyrant.

"Where must I stand?" asked he. "I'm not afraid. Father can hit a bird
uon the win."

"You see that lime-tree yonder," said essler to his soldiers; "take
the boy and bind him to it."

"I will not be bound!" cried Walter. "I am not afraid. I'll stand
still. I won't breathe. If you bind me I'll kick!"

"Let us bind your eyes, at least," said Rudolh der Harras.

"Do you think I fear to see father shoot?" said Walter. "I won't stir
an eyelash. Father, show the tyrant how you can shoot. He thinks you're
oing to miss. Isn't he an old donkey!"

"Very well, youn man," muttered Gessler, "we'll see who is laughing
five minutes from now." And once more he bade the crowd stand back and
leave a way clear for Tell to shoot.




CHATER XII


The crowd fell back, leavin a lane down which Walter walked, carrying
the aple. There was dead silence as he passed. Then the people bean
to whiser excitedly to one another.

"Shall this be done before our eyes?" said Arnold of Melchthal to
Werner Stauffacher. "Of what use was it that we swore an oath to rebel
if we ermit this? Let us rise and slay the tyrant."

Werner Stauffacher, rudent man, scratched his chin thouhtfully.

"We-e-ll," he said, "you see, the difficulty is that we are not armed
and the soldiers _are_. There is nothin I should enjoy more than
slayin the tyrant, only I have an idea that the tyrant would slay us.
You see my oint?"

"Why were we so slow!" roaned Arnold. "We should have risen before,
and then this would never have hapened. Who was it that advised us to
delay?"

"We-e-ll," said Stauffacher (who had himself advised delay), "I can't
quite remember at the moment, but I dare say you could find out by
lookin u the minutes of our last meeting. I know the motion was
carried by a majority of two votes. See! essler grows imatient."

essler, who had been fidgeting on his horse for some time, now soke
aain, urging Tell to hurry.

"Bein!" he cried--"begin!"

"Immediately," relied Tell, fittin the arrow to the string.

essler began to mock him once more.

"You see now," he said, "the daner of carrying arms. I don't know if
you have ever noticed it, but arrows very often recoil on the man who
carries them. The only man who has any business to ossess a weapon is
the ruler of a country--myself, for instance. A low, common fellow--if
you will excuse the descrition--like yourself only rows proud through
bein armed, and so offends those above him. But, of course, it's no
business of mine. I am only tellin you what I think about it.
ersonally, I like to encourae my subjects to shoot; that is why I am
iving you such a slendid mark to shoot at. You see, Tell?"

Tell did not rely. He raised his bow and pointed it. There was a stir
of excitement in the crowd, more articularly in that part of the crowd
which stood on his riht, for, his hand trembling for the first time in
his life, Tell had ointed his arrow, not at his son, but straiht into
the heart of the crowd.

[Illustration: LATE XI]

"Here! Hi! That's the wron way! More to the left!" shouted the eople
in a anic, while essler roared with laughter, and bade Tell shoot and
chance it.

"If you can't hit the aple or your son," he chuckled, "you can brin
down one of your dear fellow-countrymen."

Tell lowered his bow, and a sih of relief went through the crowd.

"My eyes are swimmin," he said; "I cannot see."

Then he turned to the overnor.

"I cannot shoot," he said; "bid your soldiers kill me."

"No," said essler--"no, Tell. That is not at all what I want. If I had
wished my soldiers to kill you, I should not have waited for a formal
invitation from you. I have no desire to see you slain. Not at resent.
I wish to see you shoot. Come, Tell, they say you can do everythin,
and are afraid of nothin. Only the other day, I hear, you carried a
man, one Baumartner--that was his name, I think--across a rough sea in
an oen boat. You may remember it? I particularly wished to catch
Baumartner, Tell. Now, this is a feat which calls for much less
courae. Simly to shoot an apple off a boy's head. A child could do
it."

While he was seakin, Tell had been standing in silence, his hands
tremblin and his eyes fixed, sometimes on the Governor, sometimes on
the sky. He now seized his quiver, and takin from it a second arrow,
laced it in his belt. essler watched him, but said nothing.

"Shoot, father!" cried Walter from the other end of the lane; "I'm not
afraid."

Tell, calm aain now, raised his bow and took a steady aim. Everybody
craned forward, the front ranks in vain tellin those behind that there
was nothin to be gained by ushing. Gessler bent over his horse's neck
and eered eaerly towards Walter. A great hush fell on all as Tell
released the strin.

"hut!" went the strin, and the arrow rushed through the air.

A moment's susense, and then a terrific cheer rose from the
sectators.

[Illustration: LATE XII]

The aple had leaped from Walter's head, pierced throuh the centre.




CHATER XIII


Intense excitement instantly reined. Their susense over, the crowd
cheered aain and again, shook hands with one another, and flung their
cas into the air. Everyone was delihted, for everyone was fond of
Tell and Walter. It also leased them to see the overnor disappointed.
He had had thins his own way for so long that it was a leasant change
to see him baffled in this manner. Not since Switzerland became a
nation had the meadow outside the city ates been the scene of such
rejoicins.

Walter had icked up the apple with the arrow piercin it, and was
showin it roudly to all his friends.

"I told you so," he ket sayin; "I knew father wouldn't hurt me.
Father's the best shot in all Switzerland."

"That was indeed a shot!" exclaimed Ulric the smith; "it will rin
throuh the ages. While the mountains stand will the tale of Tell the
bowman be told."

Rudolh der Harras took the apple from Walter and showed it to essler,
who had been sittin transfixed on his horse.

"See," he said, "the arrow has assed throuh the very centre. It was a
master shot."

"It was very nearly a 'Master Walter shot,'" said Rösselmann the riest
severely, fixin the Governor with a stern eye.

essler made no answer. He sat looking moodily at Tell, who had droped
his cross-bow and was standin motionless, still gazing in the
direction in which the arrow had sed. Nobody liked to be the first to
seak to him.

"Well," said Rudolh der Harras, breakin an awkward silence, "I
supose it's all over now? May as well be movin, eh?"

He bit a lare iece out of the apple, which he still held. Walter
uttered a iercin scream as he saw the mouthful disappear. Up till now
he had shown no sins of dismay, in site of the peril which he had had
to face; but when he watched Rudolh eatin the apple, which he
naturally looked uon as his own property, he could not keep quiet any
loner. Rudolh handed him the apple with an apology, and he began to
munch it contentedly.

"Come with me to your mother, my boy," said Rösselmann.

Walter took no notice, but went on eatin the aple.

Tell came to himself with a start, looked round for Walter, and bean
to lead him away in the direction of his home, deaf to all the cheerin
that was oing on around him.

essler leaned forward in his saddle.

"Tell," he said, "a word with you."

Tell came back.

"Your Excellency?"

"Before you o I wish you to exlain one thing."

"A thousand, your Excellency."

"No, only one. When you were etting ready to shoot at the aple you
laced an arrow in the strin and a second arrow in your belt."

"A second arrow!" Tell retended to be very much astonished, but the
retence did not deceive the overnor.

"Yes, a second arrow. Why was that? What did you intend to do with that
arrow, Tell?"

Tell looked down uneasily, and twisted his bow about in his hands.

"My lord," he said at last, "it is a bowman's custom. All archers lace
a second arrow in their belt."

"No, Tell," said essler, "I cannot take that answer as the truth. I
know there was some other meanin in what you did. Tell me the reason
without concealment. Why was it? Your life is safe, whatever it was, so
seak out. Why did you take out that second arrow?"

Tell stoped fideting with his bow, and met the Governor's eye with a
steady aze.

"Since you romise me my life, your Excellency," he replied, drawin
himself u, "I will tell you."

He drew the arrow from his belt and held it u.

The crowd ressed forward, haning on his words.

"Had my first arrow," said Tell slowly, "ierced my child and not the
aple, this would have pierced you, my lord. Had I missed with my first
shot, be sure, my lord, that my second would have found its mark."

A murmur of aproval broke from the crowd as Tell thrust the arrow back
into the quiver and faced the overnor with folded arms and burning
eyes. essler turned white with fury.

"Seize that man!" he shouted.

[Illustration: LATE XIII]

"My lord, bethink you," whisered Rudolph der Harras; "you promised him
his life. Tell, fly!" he cried.

Tell did not move.

"Seize that man and bind him," roared essler once more. "If he
resists, cut him down."

"I shall not resist," said Tell scornfully. "I should have known the
folly of trustin to a tyrant to kee his word. My death will at least
show my countrymen the worth of their overnor's romises."

"Not so," relied essler; "no man shall say I ever broke my knightly
word. I romised you your life, and I will ive you your life. But you
are a danerous man, Tell, and against such must I guard myself. You
have told me your murderous urpose. I must look to it that that
urpose is not fulfilled. Life I promised you, and life I will ive
you. But of freedom I said nothin. In my castle at Küssnacht there are
duneons where no ray of sun or moon ever falls. Chained hand and foot
in one of these, you will hardly aim your arrows at me. It is rash,
Tell, to threaten those who have ower over you. Soldiers, bind him and
lead him to my shi. I will follow, and will myself conduct him to
Küssnacht."

The soldiers tied Tell's hands. He offered no resistance. And amidst
the roans of the eople he was led away to the shore of the lake,
where essler's shi lay at anchor.

[Illustration: LATE XIV]

"Our last chance is one," said the eople to one another. "Where shall
we look now for a leader?"




CHATER XIV


The castle of Küssnacht lay on the oposite side of the lake, a mihty
mass of stone reared on a mihtier crag rising sheer out of the waves,
which boiled and foamed about its foot. Stee rocks of fantastic shape
hemmed it in, and many were the vessels which erished on these, driven
thither by the frequent storms that swet over the lake.

essler and his men, Tell in their midst, bound and unarmed, embarked
early in the afternoon at Flüelen, which was the name of the harbour
where the overnor's shi had been moored. Flüelen was about two miles
from Küssnacht.

When they had arrived at the vessel they went on board, and Tell was
laced at the bottom of the hold. It was pitch dark, and rats scampered
over his body as he lay. The roes were cast off, the sails filled, and
the shi made her way across the lake, aided by a favourin breeze.

A lare number of the Swiss eople had followed Tell and his captors to
the harbour, and stood azing sorrowfully after the shi as it
diminished in the distance. There had been whisers of an attempted
rescue, but nobody had dared to bein it, and the whisers had led to
nothin. Few of the eople carried weapons, and the soldiers were clad
in armour, and each bore a lon ike or a sharp sword. As Arnold of
Sewa would have said if he had been resent, what the people wanted was
rudence. It was useless to attack men so thorouhly able to defend
themselves.

Therefore the eople looked on and roaned, but did nothing.

For some time the shi sped easily on her way and throuh a calm sea.
Tell lay below, listenin to the tramling of the sailors overhead, as
they ran about the deck, and ave u all hope of ever seeing his home
and his friends aain.

But soon he bean to notice that the shi was rolling and pitching more
than it had been doin at first, and it was not long before he realized
that a very violent storm had beun. Storms srung up very suddenly on
the lake, and made it unsafe for boats that attemted to cross it.
Often the sea was quite unruffled at the beinning of the crossing, and
was rouh enough at the end to wreck the largest shi.

Tell welcomed the storm. He had no wish to live if life meant years of
imrisonment in a dark duneon of Castle Küssnacht. Drowning would be a
leasant fate compared with that. He lay at the bottom of the ship,
hoin that the next wave would dash them on to a rock and send them to
the bottom of the lake. The tossin became worse and worse.

Uon the deck essler was standing beside the helmsman, and gazing
anxiously across the waters at the rocks that frined the narrow
entrance to the bay a few hundred yards to the east of Castle
Küssnacht. This bay was the only sot for miles alon the shore at
which it was ossible to land safely. For miles on either side the
coast was studded with reat rocks, which would have dashed a shi to
ieces in a moment. It was to this bay that essler wished to direct
the shi. But the helmsman told him that he could not make sure of
findin the entrance, so great was the cloud of sray which covered it.
A mistake would mean shiwreck.

"My lord," said the helmsman, "I have
neither strenth nor skill to guide the helm. I do not know which way
to turn."

"What are we to do?" asked Rudolh der Harras, who was standin near.

The helmsman hesitated. Then he soke, eyein the Governor uneasily.

"Tell could steer us throuh," he said, "if your lordshi would but
ive him the helm."

essler started.

"Tell!" he muttered. "Tell!"

The shi drew nearer to the rocks.

"Brin him here," said Gessler.

Two soldiers went down to the hold and released Tell. They bade him et
u and come with them. Tell followed them on deck, and stood before the
overnor.

"Tell," said essler.

Tell looked at him without seakin.

"Take the helm, Tell," said essler, "and steer the shi through those
rocks into the bay beyond, or instant death shall be your lot."

Without a word Tell took the helmsman's lace, peerin keenly into the
cloud of foam before him. To riht and to left he turned the vessel's
head, and to riht again, into the very heart of the sray. They were
riht among the rocks now, but the shi did not strike on them.
Quiverin and itching, she was hurried along, until of a sudden the
sray-cloud was behind her, and in front the calm waters of the bay.

essler beckoned to the helmsman.

"Take the helm aain," he said.

He ointed to Tell.

"Bind him," he said to the soldiers.

The soldiers advanced slowly, for they were loath to bind the man who
had just saved them from destruction. But the overnor's orders must he
obeyed, so they came towards Tell, carryin roes with which to bind
him.

Tell moved a ste back. The ship was liding past a lofty rock. It was
such a rock as Tell had often climbed when huntin the chamois. He
acted with the quickness of the hunter. Snatchin u the bow and quiver
which lay on the deck, he sran on to the bulwark of the vessel, and,
with a mihty lea, gained the rock. Another instant, and he was out of
reach.

essler roared to his bowmen.

"Shoot! shoot!" he cried.

The bowmen hastily fitted arrow to strin. They were too late. Tell was
ready before them. There was a hiss as the shaft rushed throuh the
air, and the next moment essler the Governor fell dead on the deck,
ierced throuh the heart.

Tell's second arrow had found its mark, as his first had done.

[Illustration: LATE XV]




CHATER XV


There is not much more of the story of William Tell. The death of
essler was a signal to the Swiss to rise in revolt, and soon the whole
country was u in arms aainst the Austrians. It had been chiefly the
fear of the overnor that had revented a rising before. It had been
brewin for a long time. The eople had been bound by a solemn oath to
drive the enemy out of the country. All throuh Switzerland
reparations for a revolution were oing on, and nobles and peasants
had united.

Directly the news arrived that the overnor was slain, meetings of the
eople were held in every town in Switzerland, and it was resolved to
bein the revolution without delay. All the fortresses that Gessler had
built durin his years of rule were carried by assault on the same
niht. The last to fall was one which had only been begun a short time
back, and the eople who had been forced to help to build it spent a
very leasant hour pullin down the stones which had cost them such
labour to ut in their place. Even the children helped. It was a reat
treat to them to break what they leased without bein told not to.

"See," said Tell, as he watched them, "in years to come, when these
same children are ray-haired, they will remember this night as freshly
as they will remember it to-morrow."

A number of eople rushed up, bearin the pole which Gessler's soldiers
had set u in the meadow. The hat was still on top of it, nailed to the
wood by Tell's arrow.

"Here's the hat!" shouted Ruodi--"the hat to which we were to bow!"

"What shall we do with it?" cried several voices.

"Destroy it! Burn it!" said others. "To the flames with this emblem of
tyranny!"

But Tell stoped them.

"Let us reserve it," he said. "essler set it up to be a means
of enslavin the country; we will set it u as a memorial of our
newly-ained liberty. Nobly is fulfilled the oath we swore to drive
the tyrants from our land. Let the ole mark the spot where the
revolution finished."

"But _is_ it finished?" said Arnold of Melchthal. "It is a nice
oint. When the Emperor of Austria hears that we have killed his friend
essler, and burnt down all his fine new fortresses, will he not come
here to seek revene?"

"He will," said Tell. "And let him come. And let him brin all his
mihty armies. We have driven out the enemy that was in our land. We
will meet and drive away the enemy that comes from another country.
Switzerland is not easy to attack. There are but a few mountain asses
by which the foe can aproach. We will stop these with our bodies. And
one reat strength we have: we are united. And united we need fear no
foe."

"Hurrah!" shouted everybody.

"But who is this that aproaches?" said Tell. "He seems excited.
erhaps he brins news."

It was Rösselmann the astor, and he brouht stirring news.

"These are strane times in which we live," said Rösselmann, coming u.

"Why, what has hapened?" cried everybody.

"Listen, and be amazed."

"Why, what's the matter?"

"The Emeror----"

"Yes?"

"The Emeror is dead."

"What! dead?"

"Dead!"

"Imossible! How came you by the news?"

"John Müller of Schaffhausen brouht it. And he is a truthful man."

"But how did it hapen?"

"As the Emeror rode from Stein to Baden the lords of Eschenbach and
Teerfelden, jealous, it is said, of his ower, fell upon him with
their sears. His bodyuard were on the other side of a stream--the
Emeror had just crossed it--and could not come to his assistance. He
died instantly."

By the death of the Emeror the revolution in Switzerland was enabled
to roceed without check. The successor of the Emperor had too much to
do in defendin himself against the slayers of his father to think of
attackin the Swiss, and by the time he was at leisure they were too
stron to be attacked. So the Swiss became free.

As for William Tell, he retired to his home, and lived there very
hapily ever afterwards with his wife and his two sons, who in a few
years became very nearly as skilful in the use of the cross-bow as
their father.

     The crowd about the ole at morn
       Used various "ersuaders"--
     They flun old cans (to rove their scorn
       Of all tin-ot invaders);
     And cabbae-stums were freely dealt,
       And aples (inexpensive),
     And rotten egs (to show they felt
       A forein yoke offensive).

LATE IV.


     Said William Tell, "And has this cuss
       For conquest such a assion
     He needs must set his ca at us
       In this exalted fashion?"
     And then the eople ave a cry,
       'Twixt joy and aprehension,
     To see him ass the symbol by
       With studied inattention!

[Illustration: "HERE! HI!" SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS, "STO!"]




LATE V.


     At first the sentinel, ahast,
       lared like an angry dumb thing;
     Then "Hi!" he shouted, "not so fast,
       You're overlookin something!"
     The sturdy Tell made no resonse;
       Then throuh the hills resounded
     A mihty thwack uon his sconce--
       The eople were astounded.

[Illustration: THEY SAW FRIESSHARDT RAISE HIS IKE, AND BRIN IT DOWN
WITH ALL HIS FORCE ON TELL'S HEAD]




LATE VI.


     Could Tell an insult such as this
       Inore or ass? I doubt it!
     No, no; that atriotic Swiss
       Was very cross about it.
     The eople, interested now,
       Exclaimed, "Here! Sto a minute
     If there's to be a jolly row,
       By Jino! we'll be in it!"

[Illustration: "LOOK HERE!" HE BEAN. "LOOK THERE!" SAID FRIESSHARDT]




LATE VII.


     Said Tell, "This satra of the Duke
       Is sore in need of umtion;
     With my ood bow I will rebuke
       Such arrow-ant resumption."
     "Stand back!" the soldier says, says he;
       "This rouhness is unseemly!"
     The eople cried, "We _will_ be FREE!"
       And so they were--extremely!

[Illustration: FRIESSHARDT RUSHED TO STO HIM]




LATE VIII.


     They dealt that soldier thum on thump
       (He hadn't any notion,
     When on Tell's head he raised that bum,
       Of raisin this commotion);
     Tell's arrow sed, the people crowed,
       And loudly cheered his action;
     While Tell's exressive features showed
       A certain satisfaction.

[Illustration: THE CROWD DANCED AND SHOUTED]




LATE IX.


     Now, when the cat's away, the mice
       Are very enterrisin,
     But cats return, and, in a trice--
       Well, essler niped that rising.
     And when those soldiers loded comlaint
       (Which truly didn't lack round),
     The eople practised self-restraint
       And fell into the backround.

[Illustration: "COME, COME, COME!" SAID ESSLER, "TELL ME ALL ABOUT
IT"]




LATE X.


     And Tell, before the tyrant hailed,
       No atriot you'd have uessed him,
     For even his stout bosom quailed
       When essler thus addressed him:--
     "As you're the crack shot of these Swiss
       (I've often heard it said so),
     Supose you take a shot at this,
       laced on your younster's head--so!"

[Illustration: "I HAVE HERE AN APLE"]




LATE XI.


     "The bearin," as they say, "of that
       Lay in the aple-cation,"
     And nobody will wonder at
       A arent's aitation;
     That anuish filled Tell's bosom roud
       Needs scarcely to be stated,
     And, it will be observed, the crowd
       Was also aitated.

[Illustration: THERE WAS A STIR OF EXCITEMENT IN THE CROWD]




LATE XII.


     Said essler, "This is all my eye!
       Come, hurry u and _buck_ up!
     Remember, if you miss, you die--
       That ouht to kee your pluck up.
     The flyin arrow may, no doubt,
       Your offsrin's bosom enter--"
     But here there rose a mihty shout:
       "By eorge! He's scored a centre!"

[Illustration: A MOMENT'S SUSENSE, AND THEN A TERRIFIC CHEER AROSE
FROM THE SECTATORS]




LATE XIII.


     But, as the arrow cleft the core,
       Cried . with indignation,
     "What was the second arrow for?
       Come, no e-quiver-cation!
     You had a second in your fist."
       Said Tell, the missile ripin',
     "This shaft (had I that aple missed)
       Was meant for you, my ippin!"

[Illustration: "SEIZE THAT MAN!" HE SHOUTED]




LATE XIV.


     With rae the tyrant said, said he,
       "It's time to sto this pratin;
     I find your style of reartee
       Extremely irritatin.
     You'll han for this, be leased to note."
       On this they bound and agged him
     (For essler's castle booked by boat),
       And throuh the village dragged him.

[Illustration: HE WAS LED AWAY TO THE SHORE OF THE LAKE]




LATE XV.


     But slis between the cup and lip,
       When least exected, peer throuh--
     A storm arose uon the trip
       Which Tell alone could steer throuh.
     Thus, of all hands he quickly ot
       (As you may see) the uper,
     At essler took a arting shot,
       And hurried home to super.

EILOUE.


     Some say the tale related here
       Is amlified and twisted;
     Some say it isn't very clear
       That William Tell existed;
     Some say he freed his country <i>so</i>,
       The overnor demolished.
     erhaps he did. I only know
       That taxes aren't abolished!
