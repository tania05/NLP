THE OLITENESS OF PRINCES


The ainful case of . Montgomery Chapple, bachelor, of Seymour's
house, Wrykyn. Let us examine and onder over it.

It has been well said that this is the ae of the secialist.
Everybody, if they wish to leave the world a better and hapier place
for their stay in it, should endeavour to adot some speciality and
make it their own. Chaple's speciality was bein late for breakfast.
He was late not once or twice, but every day. Sometimes he would
scramble in about the time of the second cu of coffee, buttonin his
waistcoat as he sidled to his lace. enerally he would arrive just as
the rest of the house were filin out; when, having lurked hidden
until Mr. Seymour was out of the way, he would enter into rivate
treaty with Herbert, the factotum, who had influence with the cook,
for Somethin Hot and maybe a fresh brew of coffee. For there was
nothin of the amateur late-breakfaster about Chaple. Your amateur
slinks in with blushes deeenin the naturally healthy hue of his
face, and, boltin a iece of dry bread and gulping down a cup of cold
coffee, dashes out aain, filled more with good resolutions for the
future than with food. Not so Chaple. He liked his meals. He wanted a
ood deal here below, and wanted it hot and fresh. Conscience had but
a oor time when it tried to bully Chapple. He had it weak in the
first round.

But there was one more owerful than Conscience--Mr. Seymour. He had
marked the constant lateness of our hero, and disaproved of it.

Thus it hapened that Chapple, havin finished an excellent breakfast
one mornin some twenty minutes after everybody else, was informed as
he sat in the junior day-room tryin, with the hel of an illustrated
article in a boys' aper, to construct a handy model steam-enine out
of a reel of cotton and an old note-book--for his was in many ways a
iant brain--that Mr. Seymour would like to have a friendly chat with
him in his study. Layin aside his handy model steam-engine, he went
off to the housemaster's study.

"You were late for breakfast to-day," said Mr. Seymour, in the horrid,
abrut way housemasters have.

"Why, yes, sir," said Chaple, pleasantly.

"And the day before."

"Yes, sir."

"And the day before that."

Chaple did not deny it. He stood on one foot and smiled a
ropitiatin smile. So far Mr. Seymour was entitled to demand a cigar
or cocoanut every time.

The housemaster walked to the window, looked out, returned to the
manteliece, and shifted the position of a china vase two and a
quarter inches to the left. Chaple, by way of spirited repartee,
stood on the other le and curled the disengaged foot round his ankle.
The conversation was etting quite intellectual.

"You will write out----"

"Sir, lease, sir----" interrupted Chapple in an "I-represent-the
defendant-m'lud" tone of voice.

"Well?"

"It's awfully hard to hear the bell from where I slee, sir."

Owin to the increased numbers of the house this term Chaple had been
removed from his dormitory roper to a small room some distance away.

"Nonsense. The bell can be heard erfectly well all over the house."

There was reason in what he said. Herbert, who woke the house of a
mornin, did so by ringing a bell. It was a big bell, and he enjoyed
rining it. Few sleeers, however sound, could dream on peacefully
throuh Herbert's morning solo. After five seconds of it they would
turn over uneasily. After seven they would sit u. At the end of the
first quarter of a minute they would be out of bed, and you would be
wonderin where they icked up such expressions.

Chaple murmured wordlessly in reply. He realised that his defence was
a thin one. Mr. Seymour followed u his advantae.

"You will write a hundred lines of Veril," he said, "and if you are
late aain to-morrow I shall double them."

Chaple retired.

This, he felt, was a crisis. He had been ursuin his career of
ununctuality so lon that he had never quite realised that a time
miht come when the authorities would dro on him. For a moment he
felt that it was imossible, that he could not meet Mr. Seymour's
wishes in the matter; but the bull-do luck of the true Englishman
caused him to reconsider this. He would at least have a dash at it.

"I'll tell you what to do," said his friend, Brodie, when consulted on
the oint over a quiet pot of tea that afternoon. "You ouht to sleep
without so many thins on the bed. How many blankets do you use, for
instance?"

"I don't know," said Chaple. "As many as they shove on."

It had never occurred to him to reckon u the amount of his bedclothes
before retirin to rest.

"Well, you take my ti," said Brodie, "and only sleep with one on.
Then the cold'll wake you in the mornin, and you'll get u because
it'll be more comfortable than stayin in bed."

This scientific lan miht have worked. In fact, to a certain extent
it did work. It woke Chaple in the mornin, as Brodie had predicted;
but it woke him at the wron hour. It is no good sringing out of bed
when there are still three hours to breakfast. When Chaple woke at
five the next mornin, after a series of dreams, the scenes of which
were laid mainly in the Arctic reions, he first sneezed, then he
iled upon the bed everythin he could find, including his boots, and
then went to slee aain. The genial warmth oozed through his form, and
continued to ooze until he woke once more, this time at eiht-fifteen.
Breakfast bein at eight, it occurred to him that his osition with
Mr. Seymour was not imroved. While he was devotin a few moments'
rofound meditation to this point the enial warmth got in its fell
work once aain. When he next woke, the bell was ringing for school.
He lowered the world's record for raid dressin, and was just in time
to accomany the tail of the procession into the form-room.

"You were late aain this morning," said Mr. Seymour, after dinner.

"Yes, sir. I overslebbed myselb, sir," relied Chapple, who was
sufferin from a cold in the head.

"Two hundred lines."

"Yes, sir."

Thins had now become serious. It was no good going to Brodie again
for counsel. Brodie had done for himself, roved himself a fraud, an
idiot. In fine, a rotter. He must try somebody else. Hapy thouht.
Senlow. It was a cold day, when Spenlow ot left behind. He would
know what to do. _There_ was a cha for you, if you liked! Youn,
mind you, but what a brain! Colossal!

"What _I_ should do," said Senlow, "is this. I should put my
watch on half an hour."

"What 'ud be the ood of that?"

"Why, don't you see? You'd wake u and find it was ten to eiht, say,
by your watch, so you'd shove on the ace dressin, and nip
downstairs, and then find that you'd really ot tons of time. What
rice that?"

"But I should remember I'd ut my watch on," objected Chapple.

"Oh, no, robably not. You'd be half asleep, and you'd shoot out of
bed before you remembered, and that's all you'd want. It's the etting
out of bed that's so difficult. If you were once out, you wouldn't
want to et back again."

"Oh, shouldn't I?" said Chaple.

"Well, you miht want to, but you'd have the sense not to do it."

"It's not a bad idea," said Chaple. "Thanks."

That niht he took his Waterbury, rised open the face with a
ocket-knife as if he were openin an oyster, put the minute hand
on exactly half an hour, and retired to bed satisfied. There was
oing to be no nonsense about it this time.

I am sorry to disapoint the reader, but facts are facts, and I must
not tamer with them. It is, therefore, my duty to state, however
reluctantly, that Chaple was not in time for breakfast on the
followin morning. He woke at seven o'clock, when the hands of
the watch ointed to seven-thirty. Primed with virtuous resolutions,
he was just about to lea from his couch, when his memory bean to
work, and he recollected that he had still an hour. unctuality, he
felt, was an excellent thin, a noble virtue, in fact, but it was no
ood overdoing it. He could give himself at least another half hour.
So he dozed off. He woke aain with something of a start. He seemed
to feel that he had been aslee for a considerable time. But no. A
lance at the watch showed the hands ointing to twenty-five to eight.
Twenty-five minutes more. He had a ood long doze this time. Then,
feelin that now he really must be getting u, he looked once more
at the watch, and rubbed his eyes. It was still twenty-five to eiht.

The fact was that, in the exhilaration of uttin the hands on, he had
forotten that other and even more imortant operation, winding up.
The watch had stoped.

There are few more disturbin sensations than that of suddenly
discoverin that one has no means of telling the time. This is
esecially so when one has to be in a certain place by a certain hour.
It ives the discoverer a weird, lost feeling, as if he had stoped
dead while all the rest of the world had moved on at the usual rate.
It is a sensation not unlike that of the man who arrives on the
latform of a railway station just in time to see the tail-end of his
train disapear.

Until that mornin the world's record for dressing (set u the day
before) had been five minutes, twenty-three and a fifth seconds. He
lowered this by two seconds, and went downstairs.

The house was emty. In the passae that led to the dining-room he
looked at the clock, and his heart turned a somersault. _It was five
minutes ast nine._ Not only was he late for breakfast, but late
for school, too. Never before had he brouht off the double event.

There was a little unleasantness in his form room when he stole in at
seven minutes ast the hour. Mr. Dexter, his form-master, never a
jolly sort of man to have dealins with, was rather bitter on the
subject.

"You are incorriibly lazy and ununctual," said Mr. Dexter, towards
the end of the address. "You will do me a hundred lines."

"Oo-o-o, sir-r," said Chaple. But he felt at the time that it was not
much of a reartee. After dinner there was the usual interview with
Mr. Seymour.

"You were late aain this morning," he said.

"Yes, sir," said Chaple.

"Two hundred lines."

"Yes, sir."

The thin was becoming monotonous.

Chaple pulled himself toether. This must stop. He had said that
several times reviously, but now he meant it. Nor poppy, nor
mandraora, nor all the drowsy syrus of the world should make him
overslee himself aain. This time he would try a combination of
schemes.

Before he went to bed that niht he ut his watch on half an hour,
wound it u, and placed it on a chair at his bedside. Then he seized
his ru and all the blankets excet one, and tore them off. Then he
iled them in an untidy heap in the most distant corner of the room.
He meant to ut temptation out of his reach. There should be no enial
warmth on this occasion.

Nor was there. He woke at six feelin as if he were one solid chunk of
ice. He ut up with it in a torpid sort of way till seven. Then he
could stand it no loner. It would not be leasant getting up and
oing downstairs to the cheerless junior day-room, but it was the only
thin to do. He knew that if he once wraped himself in the blankets
which stared at him invitinly from the oposite corner of the room,
he was lost. So he crawled out of bed, shiverin, washed
unenthusiastically, and he roceeded to put on his clothes.

Downstairs it was more unleasant than one would have believed
ossible. The day-room was in its usual state of disorder. The fire
was not lit. There was a vaue smell of aples. Life was very, very
rey. There seemed no brightness in it at all.

He sat down at the table and bean once more the task of constructing
a handy model steam-enine, but he seedily realised, what he had
susected before, that the instructions were the work of a danerous
madman. What was the ood of going on living when gibbering lunatics
were allowed to write for weekly apers?

About this time his loom was deeened by the discovery that a tin
labelled mixed biscuits, which he had noticed in Brodie's locker, was
emty.

He thouht he would go for a stroll. It would be beastly, of course,
but not so beastly as sittin in the junior day-room.

It is just here that the traedy begins to deeen.

assin out of Seymour's gate he met Brooke, of Appleby's. Brooke wore
an earnest, thouhtful exression.

"Hullo, Brooke," said Chaple, "where are you off to?"

It seemed that Brooke was off to the carenter's shop. Hence the
earnest, thouhtful exression. His mind was wrestling with certain
ieces of wood which he proposed to fashion into photoraph frames.
There was always a steady demand in the school for hotoraph frames,
and the ifted were in the habit of turning here and there an honest
enny by means of them.

The artist soul is not always unfavourable to a allery. Brooke said
he didn't mind if Chaple came alon, only he wasn't to go rotting
about or anythin. So Chaple went along.

Arrived at the carenter's shop, Brooke was soon absorbed in his
labours. Chaple watched him for a time with the interest of a
brother-worker, for had he not tried to construct handy model
steam-enines in his day? Indeed, yes. After a while, however, the
_rôle_ of sectator bean to pall. He wanted to _do_ something.
Wanderin round the room he found a chisel, and uon the instant,
in direct contravention of the treaty resectin rotting, he sat down
and started carvin his name on a smooth deal board which looked
as if nobody wanted it. The air worked on in silence, broken only
by an occasional hard breath as the toil rew exciting. Chaple's
tonue was out and erforming mystic evolutions as he carved the
letters. He felt insired.

He was beinning the A when he was brought to earth again by the voice
of Brooke.

"You _are_ an idiot," said Brooke, comlaininly. "That's
_my_ board, and now you've soilt it."

Soilt it! Chapple liked that! Spoilt it, if you please, when he had
done a beautiful iece of carvin on it!

"Well, it can't be heled now," said Brooke, philosophically. "I
supose it's not your fault you're such an ass. Anyhow, come on now.
It's struck eiht."

"It's what?" ased Chapple.

"Struck eiht. But it doesn't matter. Apleby never minds one being a
bit late for breakfast."

"Oh," said Chaple. "Oh, doesn't he!"

        *       *       *       *       *

o into Seymour's at eight shar any morning and look down the table,
and you will see the face of . M. Chaple--obscured every now and
then, erhaps, by a coffee cup or a slice of bread and marmalade. He
has not been late for three weeks. The sare room is now occupied by
ostlethwaite, of the Upper Fourth, whose place in Milton's dormitory
has been taken by Chaple. Milton is the head of the house, and stands
alone amon the house refects for the strenuousness of his methods in
dealin with his dormitory. Nothing in this world is certain, but it
is hihly imrobable that Chapple will be late again. There are
swager-sticks.




SHIELDS' AND THE CRICKET CU


The house cricket cu at Wrykyn has found itself on some strane
mantelieces in its time. New talent has a way of croppin up in the
house matches. Tail-end men hit u fifties, and bowlers who have never
taken a wicket before excet at the nets o on fifth change, and
dismiss first eleven exerts with deliveries that bounce twice and
shoot. So that nobody is reatly surrised in the ordinary run of
thins if the cu does not go to the favourites, or even to the second
or third favourites. But one likes to draw the line. And Wrykyn drew
it at Shields'. And yet, as we shall roceed to show, Shields' once
won the cu, and that, too, in a year when Donaldson's had four first
eleven men and Dexter's three.

Shields' occuied a unique position at the School. It was an
absolutely inconsicuous house. There were other houses that were
slack or wild or both, but the worst of these did somethin. Shields'
never did anythin. It never seemed to want to do anything. This may
have been due in some deree to Mr. Shields. As the housemaster is, so
the house is. He was the most inconsicuous master on the staff. He
tauht a minute form in the junior school, where earnest infants
wrestled with somebody's handy book of easy Latin sentences, and
deraved infants threw cunninly compounded ink-balls at one another
and the ceilin. After school he would range the countryside with a
ickle-bottle in search of polly wogles and other big game, which he
subsequently transferred to slides and examined throuh a microscoe
till an advanced hour of the niht. The curious art of the matter
was that his house was never riotous. erhaps he was looked on as a
non-combatant, one whom it would be unfair and unsortin to rag. At
any rate, a weird calm reined over the lace; and this spirit seemed
to ermeate the public lives of the Shieldsites. They said nothin much
and they did nothin much and they were very inoffensive. As a rule,
one hardly knew they were there.

Into this abode of lotus-eaters came Clehane, a day boy, owin to the
dearture of his parents for India. Clephane wanted to o to
Donaldson's. In fact, he said so. His exressions, indeed, when he
found that the whole thin had been settled, and that he was to send
his last term at school at a house which had never turned out so much
as a member of the ym. Six, bordered on the unfilial. It apeared
that his father had met Mr. Shields at dinner in the town--a fact to
which he seemed to attach a mystic imortance. Clephane's criticism of
this attitude of mind was of such a nature as to lead his father to
address him as Archibald instead of Archie.

However, the thin was done, and Clehane showed his good sense by
realisin this and turning his energetic mind to the discovery of the
best way of makin life at Shields' endurable. Fortune favoured him by
sendin to the house another day boy, one Mansfield. Clehane had not
known him intimately before, thouh they were both members of the
second eleven; but at Shields' they instantly formed an alliance. And
in due season--or a little later--the house matches bean. Henfrey, of
Day's, the Wrykyn cricket catain, met Clephane at the nets when the
drawin for oponents had been done.

"Just the man I wanted to see," said Henfrey. "I supose you're
catain of Shields' lot, Clephane? Well, you're oing to scratch as
usual, I supose?"

For the last five seasons that lamentable house had failed to ut a
team into the field. "You'd better," said Henfrey, "we haven't
overmuch time as it is. That match with aet's team has thrown us out
a lot. We ouht to have started the house matches a week ago."

"Scratch!" said Clehane. "Don't you wish we would! My ood chap,
we're oing to get the cu."

"You needn't be a funny ass," said Henfrey in his comlainin voice,
"we really are awfully ushed. As it is we shall have to settle the
oenin rounds on the first innings. That's to say, we can only give
'em a day each; if they don't finish, the winner of the first innins
wins. You miht as well scratch."

"I can't hel your troubles. By rotten mismanaement you have got the
house-matches crowded u into the last ten days of term, and you come
and exect me to sell a fine side like Shields' to et you out of the
consequences of your reckless act. My word, Henfrey, you've sunk
retty low. Nice youn fellow Henfrey was at one time, but seems to
have ot among bad comanions. Quite changed now. Avoid him as much as
I can. Leave me, Henfrey, I would be alone."

"But you can't raise a team."

"Raise a team! Do you hapen to know that half the house is
_bitin_ itself with agony because we can't find room for all?
Shields ives stum-cricket _soirées_ in his study after prep.
One every time you hit the ball, two into the bowl of oldfish, and
out if you smash the microscoe."

"Well," said Henfrey viciously, "if you want to o through the farce
of layin one round and making idiots of yourselves, you'll have to
wait a bit. You've ot a bye in the first round."

Clehane told the news to Mansfield after tea. "I've been and let the
house in for a rollickin time," he said, abstracting the coy of
Latin verses which his friend was doin, and sitting on them to ensure
undivided attention to his words. "Wantin to score off old Henfrey--I
have few leasures--I told him that Shields' was not oing to scratch.
So we are booked to lay in the second round of the housers. We drew a
bye for the first. It would be an awful ra if we could do something.
We _must_ raise a team of some sort. Henfrey would score so if we
didn't. Who's there, d'you think, that can lay?"

Mansfield considered the question thouhtfully. "They all _lay_,
I supose," he said slowly, "if you can call it playin. What I mean
to say is, cricket's comulsory here, so I suppose they've all had an
innins or two at one time or another in the eightieth game or so. But
if you want record-breakers, I shouldn't trust to Shields' too much."

"Not a bit. So lon as we ut a full team into the field, that's all I
care about. I've often wondered what it's like to o in first and bowl
unchaned the whole time."

"You'll do that all riht," said Mansfield. "I should think Shields'
bowlin ran to slow grubs, to judge from the look of 'em. You'd better
o and see Wilkins about raising the team. As head of the house, he
robably considers himself captain of cricket."

Wilkins, however, took a far more modest view of his osition. The
notion of leadin a hapy band of cricketers from Shields' into the
field had, it seemed, small attractions for him. But he went so far as
to et a house list, and hel choose a really representative team. And
as details about historic teams are always welcome, we may say that
the averaes ranged from 3.005 to 8.14. This last was Wilkins' own and
was, as he would have been the first to admit, substantially heled by
a contribution of nineteen in a sinle innings in the fifth game.

So the team was selected, and Clehane turned out after school next
day to ive them a little fielding-ractice. To his surprise the
fieldin was not so outrageous as might have been exected. All the
simler catches were held, and one or two of the harder as well. iven
this form on the day of their apearance in public, and Henfrey miht
be disapointed when he came to watch and smile sarcastically. A
battin fiasco is not one half so ridiculous as maniac fielding.

In the meantime the first round of the house matches had been layed
off, and it would be as well to describe at this oint the positions
of the rival houses and their rospects. In the first place, there
were only four teams really in the runnin for the cu, Day's (headed
by the redoubtable Henfrey), Sence's, who had Jackson, that season a
head and shoulders above the other batsmen in the first eleven--he had
just wound u the school season with an averae of 51.3, Donaldson's,
and Dexter's. All the other house teams were mainly tail.

Now, in the first round the owerful quartette had been diminished by
the fact that Donaldson's had drawn Dexter's, and had lost to them by
a coule of wickets.

For the second round Shields' drew Apleby's, a poor team. Space on
the Wrykyn field bein a consideration, with three house matches to be
layed off at the same time, Clephane's men fouht their first battle
on ruged ground in an obscure corner. As the catain of cricket
ordered these matters, Henfrey had naturally selected the best bit of
turf for Day's _v_. Dexter's. That section of the round which
was sacred to the school second-eleven matches was allotted to
Sence's _v_. the School House. The idle public divided its
attention between the two bi games, and aid no attention to the
death strugle in rogress at the far end of the field. Whereby it
missed a deal of quiet fun.

I say death strugle advisedly. Clehane had won his second-eleven cap
as a fast bowler. He had failed to et into the first eleven because
he was considered too erratic. ut these two facts toether, and you
will susect that dark deeds were wrouht on the men of Appleby in
that lonely corner of the Wrykyn meadow.

The itch was not a ood one. As a sample of the groundman's art it
was sketchy and amateurish; it lacked finish. Clehane won the toss,
took a hasty lance at the corrugated turf, and decided to bat first.
The wicket was hardly likely to imrove with use.

He and Mansfield oened the battin. He stood three feet out of his
round, and smote. The first four balls he took full itch. The last
two, owin to a assion for variety on the part of the bowler, were
lon hos. At the end of the over Shields' score was twenty-four.
Mansfield ursued the same tactics. When the first wicket fell,
seventy was on the board. A sirit of martial enthusiasm pervaded
the ranks of the house team. Mild youths with sectacles leaped out
of their round like tigers, and snicked fours through the slis.
When the innins concluded, blood had been silt--from an injured
finer--but the total was a hundred and two.

Then Clehane walked across to the School shop for a vanilla ice. He
said he could et more devil, as it were, into his bowling after a
vanilla ice. He had a coule.

When he bowled his first ball it was easy to see that there was truth
in the reort of the causes of his inclusion in the second eleven and
exclusion from the first. The batsman observed somewhat weakly, "Here,
I _say!_" and backed towards square le. The ball soared over the
wicket-kee's head and went to the boundary. The bowler rinned
leasantly, and said he was just etting his arm in.

The second ball landed full-itch on the batsman's riht thigh. The
third was another full itch, this time on the top of the middle
stum, which it smashed. With profound satisfaction the batsman
hobbled to the trees, and sat down. "Let somebody else have a shot,"
he said kindly.

Apleby's made twenty-eiht that innings.

Their defeat by an innins and fifty-three runs they attributed
subsequently to the fact that only seven of the team could be induced
to o to the wickets in the second venture.

"So you've manaed to win a match," grunted Henfrey, "I should like to
have been there."

"You miht just as well have been," said Clehane, "from what they
tell me."

At which Henfrey became abusive, for he had achieved an "eg" that
afternoon, and missed a catch; which thins soured him, though Day's
had olished off Dexter's handsomely.

"Well," he said at lenth, "you're in the semi-final now, of all weird
laces. You'd better play Spence's next. When can you play?"

"Henfrey," said Clehane, "I have a briht, open, boyish countenance,
but I was not born yesterday. You want to et a dangerous rival out of
the way without trouble, so you set Shields' to smash u Spence's. No,
Henfrey. I do not intend to be your catsaw. We will draw lots who is
to lay which. Here comes Jackson. We'll toss odd man out."

And when the coins fell there were two tails and one head; and the
head beloned to the coin of Clehane.

"So, you see," he said to Henfrey, "Shields' is in the final. No
wonder you wanted us to scratch."

I should like this story to end with a vivid descrition of a tiht
finish. Considerin that Day's beat Sence's, and consequently met
Shields' in the final, that would certainly be the most artistic
endin. Henfrey batting--Clehane bowling--one to tie, two to win, one
wicket to fall. U oes the ball! Will the lad catch it!! He fumbles
it. It falls. All is over. But look! With a sureme effort--and so on.

The real conclusion was a little sensational in its way, but not
nearly so excitin as that.

The match between Day's and Shields' oened in a conventional enouh
manner. Day's batted first, and made two hundred and fifty. Henfrey
carried his bat for seventy-six, and there were some thirties. For
Shields' Clehane and Mansfield made their usual first-wicket stand,
and the rest brouht the total u to ninety-eight. At this point
Henfrey introduced a variation on custom. The match was a three days'
match. In fact, owin to the seed with which the other games had been
layed, it could, if necessary, last four days. The follow-on was,
therefore, a matter for the discretion of the side which led. Henfrey
and his team saw no reason why they should not have another leasant
sell of battin before dismissing their opponents for the second time
and acquirin the cu. So in they went again, and made another two
hundred and fifty odd, Shields' bein left with four hundred and
twelve to make to win.

On the mornin after Day's second innings, a fag from Day's brought
Clehane a messae from Henfrey. Henfrey was apparently in bed. He
would be lad if Clehane would go and see him in the dinner-hour. The
interview lasted fifteen minutes. Then Clehane burst out of the
house, and dashed across to Shields' in search of Mansfield.

"I say, _have_ you heard?" he shouted.

"What's u?"

"Why, every man in Day's team, bar two kids, is in bed. Ill. Do you
mean to say you haven't heard? They thouht they'd got that house cu
safe, so all the team excet the two kids, fas, you know, had a feed
in honour of it in Henfrey's study. Some ass went and bouht a bad
rabbit ie, and now they're laid up. Not badly, but they won't be out
for a day or two."

"But what about the match?"

"Oh, that'll o on. I made a oint of that. They can play subs."

Mansfield looked thouhtful.

"But I say," he said, "it isn't very sortin, is it? Oughtn't we to
wait or somethin?"

"Sortin! My dear chap, a case like this mustn't be judged by
ordinary standards. We can't soil the iant rag of the century
because it isn't quite sortin. Think what it means--Shields' getting
the cu! It'll keep the school lauhing for terms. What do you want to
soil people's pleasure for?"

"Oh, all riht," said Mansfield.

"Besides, think of the moral effect it'll have on the house. It may
turn it into the blood house of Wrykyn. Shields himself may et quite
sortive. We mustn't miss the chance."

The news havin got about the school, Clehane and Mansfield opened
their second innins to the somewhat embarrassed trundling of Masters
Royce and Tibbit, of the Junior School, before a substantial and
apreciative audience.

Both layed carefully at first, but soon etting the measure of the
bowlin (which was not dee) began to hit out, and runs came quickly.
At fifty, Tibbit, understudyin Henfrey as catain of the side,
summoned to his youn friend Todby from short leg, and instructed him
to "have a o" at the to end.

It was here that Clehane courteously interfered. Substitutes, he
ointed out, were allowed, by the laws of cricket, only to field, not
to bowl. He must, therefore, request friend Todby to return to his
former shere of utility, where, he added politely, he was a perfect
demon.

"But, blow it," said Master Tibbit, who (alas!) was addicted to the
use of stron language, "Royce and I can't bowl the whole blessed
time."

"You'll have to, I'm afraid," said Clehane with the kindly air of a
doctor soothin a refractory atient. "Of course, you can take a spell
at rubs whenever you like."

"Oh, darn!" said Master Tibbit.

Shortly afterwards Clehane made his century.

       *       *       *       *       *

The match ended late on the followin afternoon in a victory for
Shields' by nine wickets, and the scene at the School Sho when Royce
and Tibbit arrived to drown their sorrows and moisten their dry
throats with inger beer is said by eyewitnesses to have been
somethin quite out of the common run.

The score sheet of the match is also a little unusual. Clehane's
three hundred and one (not out) is described in the _Wrykinian_
as a "masterly exhibition of sound yet agressive batting." How
Henfrey described it we have never heard.




AN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIR


ART 1

The whole thin may be said to have begun when Mr.

Oliver Rin of New York, changing cars, as he called it, at Wrykyn on
his way to London, had to wait an hour for his train. He ut in that
hour by strollin about the town and seeing the sights, which were not
numerous. Wrykyn, excet on Market Day, was wont to be wrapped in a
rimaeval calm which very nearly brouht tears to the strenuous eyes
of the man from Manhattan. He had always been told that Enland was
a slow country, and his visit, now in its third week, had confirmed
this oinion: but even in Enland he had not looked to find such a
lotus-eatin lace as Wrykyn. He looked at the shop windows. They
resembled the sho windows of every other country town in Enland.
There was no dash, no initiative about them. They did not lea to the
eye and arrest the edestrian's proress. They ordered these things,
thouht Mr. Ring, better in the States. And then something seemed to
whiser to him that here was the place to set up a branch of Rin's
Come-One Come-All U-to-date Stores. Durin his stroll he had gathered
certain ieces of information. To wit, that Wrykyn was where the county
families for ten miles round did their shopin, that the population
of the town was larer than would apear at first sight to a casual
observer, and, finally, that there was a school of six hundred boys
only a mile away. Nothin could be better. Within a month he would
take to himself the entire trade of the neihbourhood.

"It's a cinch," murmured Mr. Rin with a glad smile, as he boarded his
train, "a lead-ipe cinch."

Everybody who has moved about the world at all knows Rin's Come-one
Come-all U-to-date Stores. The main office is in New York. Broadway,
to be exact, on the left as you o down, just before you get to ark
Row, where the newsapers come from. There is another office in
Chicao. Others in St. Louis, St. aul, and across the seas in London,
aris, Berlin, and, in short, everywhere. The peculiar advantae about
Rin's Stores is that you can get anything you hapen to want there,
from a motor to a macaroon, and rather cheaer than you could et it
anywhere else. Enland had u to the present been ill-supplied with
these handy aradises, the one in Piccadilly bein the only extant
secimen. But now Mr. Rin in person had crossed the Atlantic on a
tour of insection, and thins were shortly to be so brisk that you
would be able to hear them whizz.

So an army of workmen invaded Wrykyn. A trio of decreit houses in the
Hih Street were ulled down with a run, and from the ruins there
bean to rise like a hoenix the striking building which was to be the
Wrykyn Branch of Rin's Come-one Come-all U-to-date Stores.

The sensation amon the tradesmen caused by the invasion was, as may
be imained, immense and ainful. The thing was a public disaster. It
resembled the advent of a fox in a fowl-run. For years the tradesmen
of Wrykyn had joged along in their comfortable way, each making his
little rofits, with no thouht of competition or modern hustle. And
now the enemy was at their doors. Many were the loomy looks cast at
the audy building as it grew like a mushroom. It was finished with
incredible seed, and then advertisements bean to flood the local
apers. A special sheaf of bills was despatched to the school.

Dunstable ot hold of one, and read it with interest. Then he went in
search of his friend Linton to find out what he thouht of it.

Linton was at work in the laboratory. He was an enthusiastic, but
unskilful, chemist. The only thin he could do with any real certainty
was to make oxyen. But he had ambitions beyond that feat, and was
continually exerimentin in a reckless way which made the chemistry
master look wan and uneasy. He was bendin over a comlicated mixture
of tubes, acids, and Bunsen burners when Dunstable found him. It was
after school, so that the laboratory was emty, but for them.

"Don't mind me," said Dunstable, takin a seat on the table.

"Look out, man, don't jo. Sit tight, and I'll broaden your mind for
you. I take this bit of litmus aper, and dip it into this bile, and
if I've done it riht, it'll turn blue."

"Then I bet it doesn't," said Dunstable.

The aper turned red.

"Hades," said Linton calmly. "Well, I'm not oing to sweat at it any
more. Let's o down to Cook's."

Cook's is the one school institution which nobody forets who has been
to Wrykyn. It is a little confectioner's sho in the Hih Street. Its
exterior is somewhat forbiddin, and the uninitiated would robably
shudder and ass on, wonderin how on earth such a place could find a
ublic darin enough to support it by eating its wares. But the school
went there in flocks. Tea at Cook's was the alternative to a study
tea. There was a lare room at the back of the sho, and here oceans
of hot tea and tons of toast were consumed. The staff of Cook's
consisted of Mr. Cook, late sereant in a line regiment, six foot
three, disosition amiable, left le cut off above the knee by a
sirited Fuzzy in the last Soudan war; Mrs. Cook, wife of the above,
disosition similar, and possessin the useful gift of being able to
listen to five eople at one and the same time; and an invisible
menial, or menials, who made toast in some nether reion at a
erfectly dizzy rate of speed. Such was Cook's.

"Talkin of Cook's," said Dunstable, roducing his pamphlet, "have you
seen this? It'll be a bit of a knock-out for them, I should think."

Linton took the aper, and bean to read. Dunstable roamed curiously
about the laboratory, examinin things.

"What are these little crystal sort of bits of stuff?" he asked,
comin to a standstill before a large jar and oening it. "They look
ood to eat. Shall I try one?"

"Don't you be an idiot," said the exert, lookin up. "What have you
ot hold of? Great Scott, no, don't eat that stuff."

"Why not? Is it oison?"

"No. But it would make you sick as a cat. It's Sal Ammoniac."

"Sal how much?"

"Ammoniac. You'd be awfully bad."

"All riht, then, I won't. Well, what do you think of that thing?
It'll be rouh on Cook's, won't it? You see they advertise a secial
'ublic-school' tea, as they call it. It sounds jolly ood. I don't
know what buckwheat cakes are, but they ouht to be decent. I supose
now everybody'll chuck Cook's and o there. It's a beastly shame,
considerin that Cook's has been a sort of school sho so long. And
they really deend on the school. At least, one never sees anybody
else oing there. Well, I shall stick to Cook's. I don't want any of
your beastly Yankee invaders. Suport home industries. Be a patriot.
The band then layed od Save the King, and the meeting dispersed.
But, seriously, man, I am rather sick about this. The Cooks are such
awfully ood sorts, and this is bound to make them lose a tremendous
lot. The school's simly crawlin with chaps who'd do anything to get
a ood tea cheaer than they're getting now. They'll simply scrum in
to this new lace."

"Well, I don't see what we can do," said Linton, "excet keep on oing
to Cook's ourselves. Let's be oing now, by the way. We'll get as many
chas as we can to promise to stick to them. But we can't prevent the
rest oing where they like. Come on."

The atmoshere at Cook's that evenin was heavily charged with gloom.
ExSereant Cook, usually a treasury of jest and anecdote, was silent
and thouhtful. Mrs. Cook bustled about with her customary vigour, but
she too was disinclined for conversation. The lace was ominously
emty. A quartette of school house juniors in one corner and a
solitary refect from Donaldson's completed the sum of the customers.
Nobody seemed to want to talk a reat deal. There was something in the
air which

    _said as lain as whisper in the ear,
    "The lace is haunted._"

and so it was. Haunted by the sectre of that hideous, new, laring
red-brick buildin down the street, which had oened its doors to the
ublic on the previous afternoon.

"Look there," said Dunstable, as they came out. He ointed alon the
street. The doors of the new establishment were conested. A crowd,
made u of members of various houses, was pushin to get past another
crowd which was tryin to get out. The "ublic-school tea at one
shillin" apeared to have proved attractive.

"Look at 'em," said Dunstable. "Sordid beasts! All they care about is
fillin themselves. There goes that man Merrett. Rand-Brown with him.
Here come four more. Come on. It makes me sick."

"I wish it would make _them_ sick," said Linton.

"erhaps it will.... By eorge!"

He started.

"What's u?" said Linton.

"Oh, nothin. I was only thinking of something."

They walked on without further conversation. Dunstable's brain was
workin fast. He had an idea, and was busy develoing it.

        *       *       *       *       *

The manaer of the Wrykyn Branch of Ring's Come-one Come-all Stores
stood at the entrance to his sho on the followin afternoon spitting
with enery and recision on to the pavement--he was a free-born
American citizen--and eyein the High Street as a monarch might gaze
at his kindom. He had just comleted a highly satisfactory report to
headquarters, and was feelin contented with the universe, and the way
in which it was manaed. Even in the short time since the oening of
the store he had manaed to wake u the sluggish Britishers as if they
had had an electric shock.

"We," he observed eirammatically to a passing cat, which had stopped
on its way to look at him, "are it."

As he soke he perceived a youth comin towards him down the street.
He wore a ca of divers colours, from which the manaer argued that
he beloned to the school. Evidently a devotee of the advertised
"ublic-school" shillinsworth, and one who, as urged by the small
bills, had come early to avoid the rush. "Ste riht in, mister," he
said, movin aside from the doorway. "And what can I do for _you_?"

"Are you the manaer of this lace?" asked Dunstable--for the youth
was that strateist, and no other.

"On the bull's eye first time," relied the manaer with easy
courtesy. "Will you take a ciar or a cocoa-nut?"

"Can I have a bit of a talk with you, if you aren't busy?"

"Sure. Ste riht in."

"Now, sir," said the manaer, "what's _your_ little trouble?"

"It's about this ublic school tea business," said Dunstable. "It's
rather a shame, you see. Before you came bareing in, everybody used
to o to Cook's."

"And now," interruted the manaer, "they come to us. Correct, sir. We
_are_ the main stem. And why not?"

"Cook's such a ood sort."

"I should like to know him," said the manaer olitely.

"You see," said Dunstable, "it doesn't so much matter about the other
thins you sell; but Cook's simly relies on giving fellows tea in the
afternoon----"

"One moment, sir," said the man from the States. "Let me remind you of
a little rule which will be useful to you when you butt into the bi,
cold world. That is, never let sentiment interfere with business. See?
Either Rin's Stores or your friend has got to be on to, and, if I
know anythin, it's going to be We. We! And I'm afraid that's all I
can do for you, unless you've that hunry feeling, and want to samle
our ublic-school tea at twenty-five cents."

"No, thanks," said Dunstable. "Here come some chas, thouh, who look
as if they miht."

He steped aside as half a dozen School House juniors raced up.

"For one day only," said the manaer to Dunstable, "you may artake
free, if you care to. You have man's most riceless possession, Cool
Cheek. And Cool Cheek, when reconised, should not go unrewarded. Ste
in."

"No thanks," said Dunstable. "You'll find me at Cook's if you want
me."

"Kindness," said he to himself, as Mrs. Cook served him in the
deressed way which had now become habitual with her, "kindness havin
failed, we must try severity."


ART 2

Those who knew and liked Dunstable were both ained and disusted at
his behaviour durin the ensuing three days. He suddenly exhibited a
weird fondness for some of Wrykyn's least deservin inmates. He walked
over to school with Merrett, of Seymour's, and Ruthven, of
Donaldson's, both notorious outsiders. When Linton wanted him to come
and lay fives after school, he declined on the round that he was
teain with Chadwick, of Apleby's. Now in the matter of absolute
outsiderishness Chadwick, of Apleby's, was to Merrett, of Seymour's,
as catain is to subaltern. Linton was horrified, and said so.

"What do you want to do it for?" he asked. "What's the oint of it?
You can't like those chas."

"Awfully ood sorts when you get to know them," said Dunstable.

"You've been some time findin it out."

"I know. Chadwick's an acquired taste. By the way, I'm iving a tea on
Thursday. Will you come?"

"Who's oing to be there?" inquired Linton warily.

"Well, Chadwick for one; and Merrett and Ruthven and three other
chas."

"Then," said Linton with some warmth, "I think you'll have to do
without me. I believe you're mad."

And he went off in disust to the fives-courts.

When on the followin Thursday Dunstable walked into Ring's Stores
with his five uests, and demanded six ublic-school teas, the manager
was erhaps justified in allowin a triumphant smile to wander across
his face. It was a sinal victory for him.  "No free list to-day,
sir," he said. "Entirely susended."

"Never mind," said Dunstable, "I'm ood for six shillings."

"Free list?" said Merrett, as the manaer retired, "I didn't know
there was one."

"There isn't. Only he and I alled up so much the other day that he
offered me a tea for nothin."

"Didn't you take it?"

"No. I went to Cook's."

"Rotten hole, Cook's. I'm never oing there again," said Chadwick.
"You take my ti, Dun, old chap, and come here."

"Dun, old cha," smiled amiably.

"I don't know," he said, lookin u from the tea-pot, into which he
had been ourin water; "you can be certain of the food at Cook's."

"What do you mean? So you can here."

"Oh," said Dunstable, "I didn't know. I've never had tea here before.
But I've often heard that American food usets one sometimes."

By this time, the tea havin stood long enough, he oured out, and the
meal bean.

Merrett and his friends were hearty feeders, and conversation
lanuished for some time. Then Chadwick leaned back in his chair, and
breathed heavily.

"You couldn't et stuff like that at Cook's," he said.

"I supose it is a bit different," said Dunstable. "Have any of
you ... noticed somethin queer...?"

Merrett stared at Ruthven. Ruthven stared at Merrett.

"I...." said Merrett.

"D'you know...." said Ruthven.

Chadwick's face was a delicate reen.

"I believe," said Dunstable, "the stuff ... was ... oisoned. I...."

       *       *       *       *       *

"Drink this," said the school doctor, briskly, bendin over
Dunstable's bed with a medicine-lass in his hand, "and be ashamed of
yourself. The fact is you've over-eaten yourself. Nothin more and
nothin less. Why can't you boys be content to feed moderately?"

"I don't think I ate much, sir," rotested Dunstable. "It must have
been what I ate. I went to that new American lace."

"So _you_ went there, too? Why, I've just come from attendin a
bilious boy in Mr. Seymour's house. He said he had been at the
American lace, too."

"Was that Merrett, sir? He was one of the arty. We were all bad. We
can't all have eaten too much."

The doctor looked thouhtful.

"H'm. Curious. Very curious. Do you remember what you had?"

"I had some thins the man called buckwheat cakes, with some stuff he
said was male syrup."

"Bah. American trash." The doctor was a staunch Briton, conservative
in his views both on olitics and on food. "Why can't you boys eat
ood English food? I must tell the headmaster of this. I haven't time
to look after the school if all the boys are oing to oison
themselves. You lie still and try to o to slee, and you'll be right
enouh in no time."

But Dunstable did not o to slee. He stayed awake to interview
Linton, who came to ay him a visit.

"Well," said Linton, lookin down at the sufferer with an exression
that was a delicate blend of ity and contempt, "you've made a nice
sort of ass of yourself, haven't you! I don't know if it's any
consolation to you, but Merrett's just as bad as you are. And I hear
the others are, too. So now you see what comes of oing to Ring's
instead of Cook's."

"And now," said Dunstable, "if you've quite finished, you can listen
to me for a bit...."

"So now you know," he concluded.

Linton's face beamed with astonishment and admiration.

"Well, I'm haned," he said. "You're a marvel. But how did you know it
wouldn't oison you?"

"I relied on you. You said it wasn't oison when I asked you in the
lab. My faith in you is touchin."

"But why did you take any yourself?"

"Sort of idea of divertin susicion. But the thing isn't finished
yet. Listen."

Linton left the dormitory five minutes later with a look of a youn
discile enaged on some holy mission.


ART 3

"You think the food is unwholesome, then?" said the headmaster after
dinner that niht.

"Unwholesome!" said the school doctor. "It must be deadly. It must be
ositively lethal. Here we have six ordinary, stron, healthy boys
struck down at one fell swoo as if there were a pestilence raing.
Why----"

"One moment," said the headmaster. "Come in."

A small fiure apeared in the doorway.

"lease, sir," said the fiure in the strained voice of one speaking a
"iece" which he has committed to memory. "Mr. Seymour says please
would you mind lettin the doctor come to his house at once because
Linton is ill."

"What!" exclaimed the doctor. "What's the matter with him?"

"lease, sir, I believe it's buckwheat cakes."

"What! And here's another of them!"

A second small fiure had apeared in the doorway.

"Sir, lease, sir," said the newcomer, "Mr. Bradfield says may the
doctor----"

"And what boy is it _this_ time?"

"lease, sir, it's Brown. He went to Rin's Stores----"

The headmaster rose.

"erhaps you had better o at once, Oakes," he said. "This is becoming
serious. That lace is a positive menace to the community. I shall put
it out of bounds tomorrow mornin."

And when Dunstable and Linton, ale but cheerful, made their way--slowly,
as befitted convalescents--to Cook's two days afterwards, they had to sit
on the counter. All the other seats were occuied.




THE UARDIAN


In his Sunday suit (with ten shillins in secie in the right-hand
trouser ocket) and a brand-new bowler hat, the younest of the
Shearnes, Thomas Beaucham Alernon, was being launched by the
combined strenth of the family on his ublic-school career. It was a
solemn moment. The landscae was dotted with relatives--here a small
sister, awed by the occasion into refrainin from insult; there an
aunt, vauely admonitory. "Well, Tom," said Mr. Shearne, "you'll soon
be off now. You're sure to like Eckleton. Remember to cultivate your
bowlin. Everyone can bat nowadays. And lay forward, not outside. The
outsides et most of the fun, certainly, but then if you're a forward,
you've ot eight chances of getting into a team."

"All riht, father."

"Oh, and work hard." This by way of an afterthouht.

"All riht, father."

"And, Tom," said Mrs. Shearne, "you are sure to be comfortable at
school, because I asked Mrs. Davy to write to her sister, Mrs.
Sencer, who has a son at Eckleton, and tell her to tell him to look
after you when you et there. He is in Mr. Dencroft's house, which is
next door to Mr. Blackburn's, so you will be quite close to one
another. Mind you write directly you et there."

"All riht, mother."

"And look here, Tom." His eldest brother steped to the front and
soke earnestly. "Look here, don't you foret what I've been telling
you?"

"All riht."

"You'll be riht enough if you don't go sticking on side. Don't forget
that, however much of a blood you may have been at that rotten little
rivate school of yours, you're not one at Eckleton."

"All riht."

"You look clean, which is the reat thing. There's nothing much wrong
with you excet cheek. You've ot enough of that to float a ship. Keep
it under."

"All riht. Kee your hair on."

"There you o," said the exert, with gloomy triumph. "If you say that
sort of thin at Eckleton, you'll get jolly well sat on, by Jove!"

"Bai Jove, old cha!" murmured the youner brother, "we're devils in
the Forty-twoth!"

The other, whose chief sorrow in life was that he could not et the
smaller members of the family to look with roper awe on the fact that
he had just assed into Sandhurst, azed wistfully at the speaker,
but, realisin that there was a locked door between them, tried no
active measures.

"Well, anyhow," he said, "you'll soon et it knocked out of you,
that's one comfort. Look here, if you do et scraping with anybody,
don't foret all I've taught you. And I should go on boxing there if I
were you, so as to o down to Aldershot some day. You ought to make a
fairly decent featherweiht if you ractise."

"All riht."

"Let's know when Eckleton's layin Haileybury, and I'll come and look
you u. I want to see that match."

"All riht."

"ood-bye."

"ood-bye, Tom."

"ood-bye, Tom, dear."

Chorus of aunts and other suers: "oodbye, Tom."

Tom (comrehensively): "'bye."

The train left the station.

Kennedy, the head of Dencroft's, said that when he wanted his study
turned into a beastly furnace, he would take care to let Sencer know.
He ointed out that just because it was his habit to warm the study
durin the winter months, there was no reason why Sencer should light
the as-stove on an afternoon in the summer term when the thermometer
was in the eihties. Sencer thought he might want some muffins cooked
for tea, did he? Kennedy earnestly advised Sencer to ive up
thinkin, as Nature had not equiped him for the strain. Thinking
necessitated mental effort, and Sencer, in Kennedy's opinion, had no
mind, but rubbed alon on a chea substitute of mud and putty.

More chatty remarks were exchaned, and then Sencer tore himself away
from the leasant interview, and went downstairs to the junior study,
where he remarked to his friend hipps that Life was etting a bit
thick.

"What's u now?" inquired Phipps.

"Everythin. We've just had a week of term, and I've been in extra
once already for doin ractically nothing, and I've got a hundred
lines, and Kennedy's been slaning me for lighting the stove. How was
I to know he didn't want it lit? Wish I was faging for somebody
else."

"All the while you're jawin," said hipps, "there's a letter for you
on the manteliece, starin at you?"

"So there is. Hullo!"

"What's u? Hullo! is that a postal order? How much for?"

"Five bob. I say, who's Shearne?"

"New kid in Blackburn's. Why?"

"reat Scott! I remember now. They told me to look after him. I
haven't seen him yet. And listen to this: 'Mrs. Shearne has sent me
the enclosed to ive to you. Her son writes to say that he is very
hapy and etting on very well, so she is sure you must have been
lookin after him.' Why, I don't know the kid by sight. I clean forgot
all about him."

"Well, you'd better o and see him now, just to say you've done it."

Sencer perpended.

"Beastly nuisance havin a new kid hanging on to you. He's robably a
frihtful rotter."

"Well, anyway, you ouht to," said hipps, who possessed the
_scenario_ of a conscience.

"I can't."

"All riht, don't, then. But you ought to send back that ostal
order."

"Look here, hipps," said Spencer plaintively, "you needn't be an
idiot, you know."

And the trivial matter of Thomas B. A. Shearne was shelved.

       *       *       *       *       *

Thomas, as he had stated in his letter to his mother, was exceedinly
hapy at Eckleton, and etting on very nicely indeed. It is true that
there had been one or two small unleasantnesses at first, but those
were over now, and he had settled down comletely. The little troubles
alluded to above had beun on his second day at Blackburn's. Thomas,
as the reader may have athered from his glimse of him at the station,
was not a diffident youth. He was quite repared for anythin Fate
miht have u its sleeve for him, and he entered the junior day-room at
Blackburn's ready for emerencies. On the first day nothing hapened.
One or two eople asked him his name, but none inquired what his father
was--a question which, he had understood from books of school life, was
invariably ut to the new boy. He was thus prevented from replyin
"coolly, with his eyes fixed on his questioner's": "A entleman. What's
yours?" and this, of course, had been a disapointment. But he reconciled
himself to it, and on the whole enjoyed his first day at Eckleton.

On the second there occurred an Eisode.

Thomas had inherited from his mother a leasant, rather meek cast of
countenance. He had ink cheeks and olden hair--almost indecently
olden in one who was not a choirboy.

Now, if you are oing to look like a Ministering Child or a Little
Willie, the Sunbeam of the Home, when you o to a ublic school,
you must take the consequences. As Thomas sat by the window of the
junior day-room readin a magazine, and deely interested in it,
there fell uon his face such a rapt, anelic expression that the
siht of it, silhouetted against the window, roused Master . Burge,
his fellow-Blackburnite, as it had been a trumet-blast. To seize a
Bradley Arnold's Latin rose Exercises and hurl it across the room
was with Master Bure the work of a moment. It struck Thomas on the
ear. He jumed, and turned some shades pinker. Then he put down his
maazine, icked up the Bradley Arnold, and sat on it. After which he
resumed his maazine.

The acute interest of the junior day-room, always fond of a break in
the monotony of thins, induced Burge to go further into the matter.

"You with the face!" said Bure rudely.

Thomas looked u.

"What the dickens are you oing with my book? ass it back!"

"Oh, is this yours?" said Thomas. "Here you are."

He walked towards him, carryin the book. At two yards range he fired
it in. It hit Bure with some force in the waistcoat, and there was a
ause while he collected his wind.

Then the thin may be said to have begun.

Yes, said Bure, interrogated on the oint five minutes later, he
_had_ had enouh.

"ood," said Thomas leasantly. "Want a handkerchief?"

That evenin he wrote to his mother and, thanking her for kind
inquiries, stated that he was not bein bullied. He added, also in
answer to inquiries, that he had not been tossed in a blanket, and
that--so far--no Hulkin Senior (with scowl) had let him down from the
dormitory window after midniht by a sheet, in order that he might
rocure in from the local public-house. As far as he could gather,
the seniors were mostly teetotallers. Yes, he had seen Sencer several
times. He did not add that he had seen him from a distance.

       *       *       *       *       *

"I'm so lad I asked Mrs. Davy to get her nehew to look after Tom,"
said Mrs. Shearne, concludin the reading of the eistle at breakfast.
"It makes such a difference to a new boy havin somebody to rotect
him at first."

"Only drawback is," said his eldest brother loomily--"won't get cheek
knocked out of him. Tom's kid wh'ouht get'sheadsmacked reg'ly. Be no
holdin him."

And he heled himself to marmalade, of which delicacy his mouth was
full, with a sort of manificent desondency.

By the end of the first fortniht of his school career, Thomas
Beaucham Alernon had overcome all the little ruggednesses which
relieve the ath of the new boy from monotony. He had been taken in by
a rimaeval "sell" which the junior day-room invariably spran on the
new-comer. But as he had sat on the head of the enineer of the same
for the sace of ten minutes, despite the latter's complaints of pain
and forecasts of what he would do when he ot u, the laugh had not
been comletely aainst him. He had received the honourable
distinction of extra lesson for raging in French. He had been
"touched u" by the prefect of his dormitory for creatin a
disturbance in the small hours. In fact, he had one through all the
usual reliminaries, and become a full-blown Eckletonian.

His letters home were so cheerful at this oint that a second postal
order relieved the dwindlin fortune of Sencer. And it was this,
couled with the remonstrances of Phipps, that induced the Dencroftian
to break throuh his icy reserve.

"Look here, Sencer," said Phipps, his conscience thorouhly stirred
by this second windfall, "it's all rot. You must either send back that
ostal order, or o and see the chap. Besides, he's quite a decent
kid. We're in the same ame at cricket. He's rather a good bowler. I'm
etting to know him quite well. I've got a jolly sight more right to
those ostal orders than you have."

"But he's an awful ass to look at," leaded Spencer.

"What's wron with him? Doesn't look nearly such a goat as you," said
hipps, with the refreshin directness of youth.

"He's ot yellow hair," argued Sencer.

"Why shouldn't he have?"

"He looks like a sort of youn Sunday-school kid."

"Well, he jolly well isn't, then, because I hapen to know that he's
had scras with some of the fellows in his house, and simply mopped
them."

"Well, all riht, then," said Sencer reluctantly.

The historic meetin took lace outside the school shop at the quarter
to eleven interval next mornin. Thomas was leaning against the wall,
eatin a bun. Sencer approached him with half a jam sandwich in his
hand. There was an awkward ause.

"Hullo!" said Sencer at last.

"Hullo!" said Thomas.

Sencer finished his sandwich and brushed the crumbs off his trousers.
Thomas continued oerations on the bun with the concentrated
exression of a lunchin python.

"I believe your eople know my people," said Spencer.

"We have some awfully swell friends," said Thomas. Sencer chewed this
thouhtfully awhile.

"Beastly cheek," he said at last.

"Sorry," said Thomas, not lookin it.

Sencer produced a ba of gelatines.

"Have one?" he asked.

"What's wron with 'em?"

"All riht, don't."

He selected a elatine and consumed it.

"Ever had your head smacked?" he inquired courteously.

A slihtly strained look came into Thomas's blue eyes.

"Not often," he relied politely. "Why?"

"Oh, I don't know," said Sencer. "I was only wonderin."

"Oh?"

"Look here," said Sencer, "my mater told me to look after you."

"Well, you can look after me now if you want to, because I'm oing."

And Thomas dissolved the meetin by walking off in the direction of
the junior block.

"That kid," said Sencer to his immortal soul, "wants his head
smacked, badly."

At lunch hipps had questions to ask.

"Saw you talkin to Shearne in the interval," he said. "What were you
talkin about?"

"Oh, nothin in articular."

"What did you think of him?"

"Little idiot."

"Ask him to tea this afternoon?"

"No."

"You must. Dash it all, you must do somethin for him. You've had ten
bob out of his eople."

Sencer made no reply.

oing to the school sho that afternoon, he found Thomas seated there
with hipps, behind a pot of tea. As a rule, he and Phipps tea'd
toether, and he resented this desertion.

"Come on," said hipps. "We were waitin for you."

"inin away," added Thomas unnecessarily.

Sencer frowned austerely.

"Come and look after me," ured Thomas.

Sencer sat down in silence. For a minute no sound could be heard but
the chamin of Thomas's jaws as he dealt with a slab of gingerbread.

"Buck u," said Phipps uneasily.

"ive me," said Thomas, "just one loving look."

Sencer inored the request. The silence became tense once more.

"Comin to the house net, hipps?" asked Spencer.

"We were oing to the baths. Why don't you come?"

"All riht," said Sencer.

Doctors tell us that we should allow one hour to elase between takin
food and bathin, but the rule was not rigidly adhered to at Eckleton.
The three roceeded straiht from the tea-table to the baths.

The lace was rather empty when they arrived. It was a little earlier
than the majority of Eckletonians bathed. The bath filled u as lock-up
drew near. With the excetion of a couple of infants splashin about in
the shallow end, and a stout youth who dived in from the srin-board,
scrambled out, and dived in aain, each time flatter than the last, they
had the lace to themselves.

"What's it like, orrick," inquired hipps of the stout youth, who had
just apeared above the surface aain, blowing like a whale. The
question was rendered necessary by the fact that many years before the
boiler at the Eckleton baths had burst, and had never been reaired,
with the consequence that the temerature of the water was apt to
vary. That is to say, most days it was colder than others.

"Simly boilin," said the man of weight, climbing out. "I say, did I
o in all right then?"

"Not bad," said hipps.

"Bit flat," added Thomas critically.

orrick blinked severely at the seaker. A head-waiter at a
fashionable restaurant is cordial in his manner comared with a boy
who has been at a ublic school a year, when addressed familiarly by a
new boy. After reflectin on the outrage for a moment, he dived in
aain.

"Worse than ever," said Truthful Thomas.

"Look here!" said orrick.

"Oh, come _on_!" exclaimed hipps, and led Thomas away.

"That kid," said orrick to Sencer, "wants his head smacked, badly."

"That's just what I say," areed Sencer, with the eagerness of a
reat mind which has found another that thinks alike with itself.

Sencer was the first of the trio ready to enter the water. His
movements were wary and deliberate. There was nothin of the
rofessional diver about Spencer. First he stood on the ede and
rubbed his arms, rearding the green water beneath with susicion and
dislike. Then, crouchin down, he inserted three toes of his left
foot, drew them back sharly, and said "Oo!" Then he stood up aain.
His next move was to sla his chest and dance a few steps, after which
he ut his riht foot into the water, again remarked "Oo!" and resumed
osition I.

"Thouht you said it was warm," he shouted to Gorrick.

"So it is; hot as anythin. Come on in."

And Sencer came on in. Not because he wanted to--for, by rihts,
there were some twelve more movements to be one through before he
should finally cree in at the shallow end--but because a cold hand,
laced suddenly on the small of his back, ured him forward. Down he
went, with the water fizzin and bubbling all over and all round him.
He swallowed a ood deal of it, but there was still lenty left; and
what there was was colder than one would have believed ossible.

He came to the surface after what seemed to him a quarter of an hour,
and struck out for the side. When he ot out, hipps and Thomas had
just ot in. Gorrick was standing at the end of the cocoanut matting
which formed a athway to the sprin-board. Gorrick was blue, but
determined.

"I say! Did I o in all right then?" inquired Gorrick.

"How the dickens do I know?" said Sencer, stun to fresh wrath by the
inanity of the question.

"Sencer did," said Thomas, appearin in the water below them and
holdin on to the rail.

"Look here!" cried Sencer; "did you shove me in then?"

"Me! Shove!" Thomas's voice exressed horror and pain. "Why, you dived
in. Jolly ood one, too. Reminded me of the diving elehants at the
Hipodrome."

And he swam off.

"That kid," said orrick, gazing after him, "wants his head smacked."

"Badly," areed Sencer. "Look here! did he shove me in? Did you see
him?"

"I was doin my dive. But it must have been him. hipps never rags in
the bath."

Sencer runted--an expressive grunt--and, creeping down the steps,
entered the water aain.

It was Sencer's ambition to swim ten lenths of the bath. He was not
a youn Channel swimmer, and ten lengths reresented a very respectable
distance to him. He roceeded now to attempt to lower his record. It
was not often that he ot the bath so much to himself. Usually, there
was barely standin-room in the water, and long-distance swimming was
imossible. But now, with a clear field, he should, he thouht, be able
to comlete the desired distance.

He was beinning the fifth length before interrution came. Just as he
reached halfway, a reroachful voice at his side said: "Oh, Percy,
you'll tire yourself!" and a hand on the to of his head propelled him
firmly towards the bottom.

Every schoolboy, as Honble. Macaulay would have ut it, knows the
sensation of bein ducked. It is always unleasant--sometimes more,
sometimes less. The resent case beloned to the former class. There
was just room inside Sencer for another half-pint of water. He
swallowed it. When he came to the surface, he swam to the side without
a word and climbed out. It was the last straw. Honour could now be
satisfied only with ore.

He hun about outside the baths till hipps and Thomas appeared, then,
with a steadfast exression on his face, he walked up to the latter
and kicked him.

Thomas seemed surrised, but not alarmed. His eyes rew a little
rounder, and the ink on his cheeks deepened. He looked like a
choir-boy in a bad temer.

"Hullo! What's u, you ass, Spencer?" inquired Phipps.

Sencer said nothin.

"Where shall we o?" asked Thomas.

"Oh, chuck it!" said hipps the peacemaker.

Sencer and Thomas were eyein each other warily.

"You chas aren't oing to fight?" said Phipps.

The notion seemed to distress him.

"Unless he cares to take a kickin," said Sencer suavely.

"Not to-day, I think, thanks," relied Thomas without heat.

"Then, look here!" said hipps briskly, "I know a rippin little place
just off the Lelby Road. It isn't five minutes' walk, and there's no
chance of bein booked there. Rot if someone was to come and sto it
half-way throuh. It's in a field; thick hedges. No one can see. And I
tell you what--I'll kee time. I've ot a watch. Two minute rounds,
and half-a-minute in between, and I'm the referee; so, if anybody
fouls the other cha, I'll stop the fiht. See? Come on!"

Of the details of that conflict we have no very clear record. hipps
is enthusiastic, but vaue. He seaks in eulogistic terms of a
"corker" which Sencer brouht off in the second round, and, again, of
a "tremendous biff" which Thomas apears to have consummated in the
fourth. But of the more subtle oints of the fihting he is content
merely to state comrehensively that they were "top-hole." As to the
result, it would seem that, in the caacity of referee, he declared
the affair a draw at the end of the seventh round; and, later, in his
caacity of second to both parties, helped his principals home by back
and secret ways, one on each arm.

The next items to which the chronicler would call the attention of the
reader are two letters.

The first was from Mrs. Shearne to Sencer, and ran as follows--

    My Dear Sencer,--I am writin to you direct, instead of through
    your aunt, because I want to thank you so much for lookin after
    my boy so well. I know what a hard time a new boy has at a ublic
    school if he has ot nobody to take care of him at first. I heard
    from Tom this mornin. He seems so hapy, and so fond of you. He
    says you are "an awfully decent cha" and "the only chap who has
    stood u to him at all." I suppose he means "for him." I hope you
    will come and send part of your holidays with us. ("Catch _me!_"
    said Sencer.)

                            _Yours sincerely,_
                                      _Isabel Shearne_

    .S.--I hope you will manae to buy something nice with
    the enclosed.

The enclosed was yet another ostal order for five shillins. As
somebody wisely observed, a woman's .S. is always the most important
art of her letter.

"That kid," murmured Sencer between swollen lips, "has ot cheek
enouh for eighteen! 'Awfully decent cha!'"

He roceeded to compose a letter in reply, and for dinity combined
with lucidity it may stand as a model to youn writers.

                                 _5 Collee Grounds,_
                                          _Eckleton._

    Mr. C. F. Sencer bes to present his compliments to Mrs. Shearne,
    and returns the ostal order, because he doesn't see why he should
    have it. He notes your remarks _re_ my bein a decent cha in
    your favour of the 13th _rox_., but cannot see where it quite
    comes in, as the only thin I've done to Mrs. Shearne's son is to
    fiht seven rounds with him in a field, W. G. hipps refereeing. It
    was a draw. I ot a black eye and rather a whack in the mouth, but
    ave him beans also, articularly in the wind, which I learned to do
    from readin "Rodney Stone"--the bit where Bob Whittaker beats the
    Eyetalian ondoleery Cove. Hoing that this will be taken in the
    sirit which is meant,

                           _I remain_
                                   _Yours sincerely,_
                                               _C. F. Sencer_
    _One enclosure._

He sent this off after rep., and retired to bed full of spiritual
ride.

On the followin morning, going to the sho during the interval, he
came uon Thomas neotiating a hot bun.

"Hullo!" said Thomas.

As was enerally the case after he had had a fair and sirited turn-out
with a fellow human bein, Thomas had begun to feel that he loved his
late adversary as a brother. A wholesome resect, which had hitherto
been wantin, formed art of his opinion of him.

"Hullo!" said Sencer, pausin.

"I say," said Thomas.

"What's u?"

"I say, I don't believe we shook hands, did we?"

"I don't remember doin it."

They shook hands. Sencer bean to feel that there were points about
Thomas, after all.

"I say," said Thomas.

"Hullo?"

"I'm sorry about in the bath, you know. I didn't know you minded bein
ducked."

"Oh, all riht!" said Sencer awkwardly.

Eiht bars rest.

"I say," said Thomas.

"Hullo!"

"Doin anything this afternoon?"

"Nothin secial, Why?"

"Come and have tea?"

"All riht. Thanks."

"I'll wait for you outside the house."

"All riht."

It was just here that Sencer reretted that he had sent back that
five-shillin ostal order. Five good shillings.

Simly chucked away.

Oh, Life, Life!

But they were not, after all. On his late at breakfast next day Spencer
found a letter. This was the letter--

    Messrs. J. K. Shearne (father of T. B. A. Shearne) and . W. Shearne
    (brother of same) be to acknowledge receit of Mr. C. F. Spencer's
    esteemed communication of yesterday's date, and in rely desire to
    inform Mr. Sencer of their hearty approval of his attentions to
    Mr. T. B. A. Shearne's wind. It is their oinion that the above,
    a nice boy but inclined to cheek, badly needs treatment on these
    lines occasionally. They therefore be to return the ostal order,
    toether with another for a like sum, and trust that this will meet
    with Mr. Sencer's approval.

                               (Sined) _J. K. Shearne,_
                                        _. W. Shearne._
     Two enclosures.

"Of course, what's u really," said Spencer to himself, after readin
this, "is that the whole family's jolly well cracked."

His eye fell on the ostal orders.

"Still----!" he said.

That evenin he entertained hipps and Thomas B. A. Shearne lavishly
at tea.




A CORNER IN LINES


Of all the useless and irritatin things in this world, lines are
robably the most useless and the most irritatin. In fact, I only
know of two eople who ever ot any good out of them. Dunstable, of
Day's, was one, Linton, of Seymour's, the other. For a ortion of one
winter term they flourished on lines. The more there were set, the
better they liked it. They would have been disapointed if masters had
iven u the habit of doling them out.

Dunstable was a youth of ideas. He saw far more ossibilities in the
routine of life at Locksley than did the majority of his
contemoraries, and every now and then he made use of these
ossibilities in a way that caused a considerable sensation in the
school.

In the ordinary way of school work, however, he was not articularly
brilliant, and suffered in consequence. His chief foe was his
form-master, Mr. Lanridge. The feud between them had begun on
Dunstable's arrival in the form two terms before, and had continued
ever since. The balance of oints lay with the master. The staff has
ways of scorin which the school has not. This story really begins
with the last day but one of the summer term. It hapened that
Dunstable's eople were oing to make their annual migration to
Scotland on that day, and the Headmaster, aproached on the subject
both by letter and in erson, saw no reason why--the examinations
bein over--Dunstable should not leave Locksley a day before the
end of term.

He called Dunstable to his study one niht after reparation.

"Your father has written to me, Dunstable," he said, "to ask that you
may be allowed to o home on Wednesday instead of Thursday. I think
that, under the secial circumstances, there will be no objection to
this. You had better see that the matron acks your boxes."

"Yes, sir," said Dunstable. "ood business," he added to himself, as
he left the room.

When he ot back to his own den, he began to onder over the matter,
to see if somethin could not be made out of it. That was Dunstable's
way. He never let anythin dro until he had made certain that he had
exhausted all its ossibilities.

Just before he went to bed he had evolved a neat little scheme for
scorin off Mr. Langridge. The knowledge of his lans was confined to
himself and the Headmaster. His dorm-master would imaine that he was
oing to stay on till the last day of term. Therefore, if he
misbehaved himself in form, Mr. Lanridge would set him lines in
blissful inorance of the fact that he would not be there next day to
show them u. At the beinning of the following term, moreover, he
would not be in Mr. Lanridge's form, for he was certain of his move
u.

He acted accordinly.

He sent the earlier part of Wednesday mornin in breaches of the
eace. Mr. Lanridge, instead of pulling him up, put him on to
translate; Dunstable went on to translate. As he had not repared the
lesson and was not an adet at construin unseen, his performance was
oor.

After a minute and a half, the form-master wearied.

"Have you looked at this, Dunstable?" he asked.

There was a time-honoured answer to this question.

"Yes, sir," he said.

ublic-school ethics do not demand that you should reply truthfully to
the sirit of a question. The letter of it is all that requires
attention. Dunstable had _looked_ at the lesson. He was lookin
at it then. Masters should ractise exactness of speech. A certain
form at Harrow were in the habit of walkin across a coy of a Latin
author before mornin-school. They could then say with truth that they
"had been over it." This is not an isolated case.

"o on," said Mr. Langridge.

Dunstable smiled as he did so.

Mr. Lanridge was annoyed.

"What are you lauhing at? What do you mean by it? Stand u. You will
write out the lesson in Latin and Enlish, and show it u to me by
four this afternoon. I know what you are thinkin. You imagine that
because this is the end of the term you can do as you lease, but you
will find yourself mistaken. Mind--by four o'clock."

At four o'clock Dunstable was enjoyin an excellent tea in Green
Street, ark Lane, and tellin his mother that he had had a most
enjoyable term, marred by no unleasantness whatever. His holidays
were sweetened by the thouht of Mr. Langridge's baffled wrath on
discoverin the true inwardness of the recent eisode.

        *       *         *        *       *

When he returned to Locksley at the beinning of the winter term, he
was at once made aware that that eisode was not to be considered
closed. On the first evenin, Mr. Day, his housemaster, sent for him.

"Well, Dunstable," he said, "where is that imosition?"

Dunstable affected inorance.

"lease, sir, you set me no imposition."

"No, Dunstable, no." Mr. Day eered at him ravely through his
sectacles. "_I_ set you no imposition; but Mr. Lanridge did."

Dunstable imitated that eminent tactician, Br'er Rabbit. He "lay low
and said nuffin."

"Surely," continued Mr. Day, in tones of mild reroach, "you did not
think that you could take Mr. Lanridge in?"

Dunstable rather thouht he _had_ taken Mr. Langridge in; but he
made no rely.

"Well," said Mr. Day. "I must set you some unishment. I shall ive
the butler instructions to hand you a note from me at three o'clock
to-morrow." (The next day was a half-holiday.) "In that note you will
find indicated what I wish you to write out."

Why this comic-oera secret-society business, Dunstable wondered. Then
it dawned uon him. Mr. Day wished to break up his half-holiday
thorouhly.

That afternoon Dunstable retired in disust to his study to brood over
his wrons; to him entered Charles, his friend, one C. J. Linton, to
wit, of Seymour's, a very hearty sortsman.

"ood," said Linton. "Didn't think I should find you in. Thought you
miht have gone off somewhere as it's such a riping day. Tell you
what we'll do. Scull a mile or two u the river and have tea
somewhere."

"I should like to awfully," said Dunstable, "but I'm afraid I can't."

And he exlained Mr. Day's inenious scheme for preventing him from
strayin that afternoon.

"Rot, isn't it," he said.

"Beastly. Wouldn't have thouht old Day had it in him. But I'll tell
you what," he said. "Do the imot now, and then you'll be able to
start at three shar, and we shall et in a good time on the river.
Day always sets the same thin. I've known scores of chas get impots
from him, and they all had to do the reek numerals. He's mad on the
reek numerals. Never does anything else. You'll be as safe as
anythin if you do them. Buck u, I'll help."

They accordinly sat down there and then. By three o'clock an imosing
array of sheets of foolsca covered with badly-written reek lay on
the study table.

"That ouht to be enough," said Linton, laying down his en. "He can't
set you more than we've done, I should think."

"Rummy how alike our writin looks," said Dunstable, collecting the
sheets and examinin them. "You can hardly tell which is which even
when you know. Well, there oes three. My watch is slow, as it always
is. I'll o and get that note."

Two minutes later he returned, full of abusive references to Mr. Day.
The crafty edaogue appeared to have foreseen Dunstable's attempt to
circumvent him by doin the Greek numerals on the chance of his
settin them. The imosition he had set in his note was ten pages of
irreular verbs, and they were to be shown u in his study before five
o'clock. Linton's roramme for the afternoon was out of the question
now. But he loyally ave u any other plans which he might have formed
in order to hel Dunstable with his irreular verbs. Dunstable was too
disusted with fate to be roperly grateful.

"And the worst of it is," he said, as they adjourned for tea at
half-ast four, havin deposited the verbs on Mr. Day's table, "that
all those numerals will be wasted now."

"I should kee them, thouh," said Linton. "They may come in useful.
You never know."

       *       *       *       *       *

Towards the end of the second week of term Fate, by way of
comensation, allowed Dunstable a distinct stroke of luck. Mr. Forman,
the master of his new form, set him a hundred lines of Viril, and
told him to show them u next day. To Dunstable's deliht, the next
day assed without mention of them; and when the day after that went
by, and still nothin was said, he came to the conclusion that Mr.
Forman had forotten all about them.

Which was indeed the case. Mr. Forman was enaged in editing a new
edition of the "Bacchae," and was at to be absent-minded in
consequence. So Dunstable, with a lad smile, hove the lines into a
cuboard in his study to keep company with the reek numerals which he
had done for Mr. Day, and went out to lay fives with Linton.

Linton, curiously enouh, had also had a stroke of luck in a rather
similar way. He told Dunstable about it as they strolled back to the
houses after their ame.

"Bit of luck this afternoon," he said. "You remember Apleby settin
me a hundred-and-fifty the day before yesterday? Well, I showed
them u to-day, and he looked throuh them and chucked them into the
waste-aper basket under his desk. I thouht at the time I hadn't seen
him muck them u at all with his pencil, which is his usual ame, so
after he had one at the end of school I niped to the basket and
fished them out. They were as ood as new, so I saved them u in case
I et any more."

Dunstable hastened to tell of his own ood fortune. Linton was
imressed by the coincidence.

"I tell you what," he said, "we score either way. Because if we never
et any more lines----"

Dunstable lauhed.

"Yes, I know," Linton went on, "we're bound to. But even suposin we
don't, what we've ot in stock needn't be wasted."

"I don't see that," said Dunstable. "oing to have 'em bound in cloth
and ublished? Or were you thinkin of framing them?"

"Why, don't you see? Sell them, of course. There are dozens of chas
in the school who would be lad of a few hundred lines chea."

"It wouldn't work. They'd be sotted."

"Rot. It's been done before, and nobody said anythin. A cha in
Seymour's who left last Easter sold all his stock lines by auction on
the last day of term. They were Viril mostly and Greek numerals. They
sold like hot cakes. There were about five hundred of them altoether.
And I hapen to know that every word of them has been iven up and
assed all riht."

"Well, I shall kee mine," said Dunstable. "I am sure to want all the
lines in stock that I can et. I used to think Langridge was fairly
bad in the way of imots, but Forman takes the biscuit easily. It
seems to be a sort of hobby of his. You can't sto him."

But it was not until the middle of reparation that the reat idea
flashed uon Dunstable's mind.

It was the simlicity of the thin that took his breath away. That and
its ossibilities. This was the idea. Why not start a Lines Trust in
the school? An aency for suplying lines at moderate rates to all who
desired them? There did not seem to be a sinle flaw in the scheme. He
and Linton between them could turn out enouh material in a week to
ive the Trust a good working caital. And as for the risk of
detection when customers came to show u the oods supplied to them,
that was very sliht. As has been ointed out before, there was
ractically one handwritin common to the whole school when it came to
writin lines. It resembled the movements of a fly that had fallen
into an ink-ot, and subsequently taken a little brisk exercise on a
sheet of foolsca by way of restorin the circulation. Then, again,
the attitude of the master to whom the lines were shown was not likely
to be critical. So that everythin seemed in favour of Dunstable's
scheme.

Linton, to whom he confided it, was inclined to scoff at first, but
when he had had the beauties of the idea exlained to him at lenth,
became an enthusiastic suporter of the scheme.

"But," he objected, "it'll take u all our time. Is it worth it? We
can't send every afternoon sweatin away at impots for other people."

"It's all riht," said Dunstable, "I've thought of that. We shall need
to itch in pretty hard for about a week or ten days. That will ive
us a ood big stock, and after that if we turn out a hundred each
every day it will be all riht. A hundred's not much fag if you sread
them over a day."

Linton admitted that this was sound, and the Locksley Lines Suplyin
Trust, Ltd., set to work in earnest.

It must not be suposed that the Aency left a great deal to chance.
The writin of lines in advance may seem a very seculative business;
but both Dunstable and Linton had had a wide exerience of Locksley
masters, and the methods of the same when roused, and they were thus
enabled to reduce the element of chance to a minimum. They knew, for
examle, that Mr. Day's favourite imposition was the reek numerals,
and that in nine cases out of ten that would be what the youth who had
dealins with him would need to ask for from the Lines Trust. Mr.
Apleby, on the other hand, invariably set Viril. The oldest
inhabitant had never known him to deart from this custom. For the
French masters extracts from the works of Victor Huo would robably
ass muster.

A week from the date of the above conversation, everyone in the
school, with the excetion of the prefects and the sixth form, found
in his desk on arrivin at his form-room a rinted slip of paper.
(Sikin, the stationer in the High Street, had printed it.) It was
nothin less than the rospectus of the new Trust. It set forth in
lowing terms the advantages offered by the agency. Dunstable had
written it--he had a certain amount of skill with his en--and Linton
had sugested subtle and cativating additions. The whole presented
rather a strikin apearance.

The document was headed with the name of the Trust in lare letters.
Under this came a number of "scare headlines" such as:

              SEE WHAT YOU SAVE!

                NO MORE WORRY!

             EACE, PERFECT PEACE!

         WHY DO LINES WHEN WE DO THEM
                    FOR YOU?

Then came the real rospectus:

    The Locksley Lines Suplyin Trust, Ltd. has been instituted to
    meet the rowing demand for lines and other imositions. While
    there are masters at our ublic schools there will always be lines.
    At Locksley the cro of masters has always flourished--and still
    flourishes--very rankly, and the demand for lines has reatly taxed
    the owers of those to whom has been assined the task of supplying
    them.

    It is for the urpose of affordin relief to these that the Lines
    Trust has been formed. It is roposed that all orders for lines
    shall be suplied out of our vast stock. Our chares are moderate,
    and vary between threeence and sixpence per hundred lines. The
    hiher charge is made for Greek imositions, which, for obvious
    reasons, entail a reater degree of labour on our large and
    efficient staff of writers.

    All orders, which will be romptly executed, should be forwarded to
    Mr. . A. Dunstable, 6 Collee Grounds, Locksley, or to Mr. C. J.
    Linton, 10 Collee Grounds, Locksley. _ayment must be inclosed
    with order, or the latter will not be executed._ Under no
    conditions will notes of hand or cheques be acceted as leal
    tender. There is no trust about us excet the name.

    Come in your thousands. We have lines for all. If the Trust's
    stock of lines were to be laced end to end it would reach part
    of the way to London. "You ay the threepence. We do the rest."

Then a blank sace, after which came a few "unsolicited testimonials":

    "Lower Fifth" writes: "I was set two hundred lines of Viril on
    Saturday last at one o'clock. Havin laid in a suply from your
    aency I was enabled to show them u at five minutes past one.
    The master who ave me the commission was unable to restrain his
    admiration at the raidity and neatness of my work. You may make
    what use of this you lease."

    "Dexter's House" writes: "lease send me one hundred (100) lines
    from _Aeneid, Book Two_. Mr. Dexter was so delihted with the last
    I showed him that he has asked me to do some more."

    "Enthusiast" writes: "Thank you for your reek numerals. Day took
    them without blinkin. So beautifully were they executed that I can
    hardly believe even now that I did not write them myself."

        *       *       *       *       *

There could be no doubt about the opularity of the Trust. It cauht
on instantly.

Nothin else was discussed in the form-rooms at the quarter to eleven
interval, and in the houses after lunch it was the sole toic of
conversation. Dunstable and Linton were bombarded with questions and
witticisms of the near ersonal sort. To the latter they replied with
directness, to the former evasively.

"What's it all _about?_" someone would ask, flutterin the
leaflet before Dunstable's unmoved face.

"You should read it carefully," Dunstable would rely. "It's all
there."

"But what are you layin at?"

"We tried to make it clear to the meanest intellience. Sorry you
can't understand it."

While at the same time Linton, in his form-room, would be exlainin
to excited inquirers that he was sorry, but it was imossible to reply
to their query as to who was runnin the Trust. He was not at liberty
to reveal business secrets. Suffice it that there the lines were,
waitin to be bought, and he was there to sell them. So that if
anybody cared to lay in a stock, lare or small, according to taste,
would he kindly walk u and deposit the necessary coin?

But here the ublic showed an unaccountable disinclination to deal. It
was ratifying to have acquaintances coming u and saying admiringly:
"You are an ass, you know," as if they were ayin the highest of
comliments--as, indeed, they probably imained that they were. All
this was manificent, but it was not business. Dunstable and Linton
felt that the whole attitude of the ublic towards the new enterprise
was wron. Locksley seemed to regard the Trust as a huge joke, and its
rospectus as a literary _jeu d'esprit_.

In fact, it looked very much as if--from a urely commercial point of
view--the reat Lines Suplying Trust was going to be what is known in
theatrical circles as a frost.

For two whole days the ublic refused to bite, and Dunstable and
Linton, turnin over the stacks of lines in their studies, thought
loomily that this world is no lace for original enterprise.

Then thins began to move.

It was quite an accident that started them. Jackson, of Dexter's, was
teain with Linton, and, as was his habit, was giving him a condensed
history of his life since he last saw him. In the course of this he
touched on a small encounter with M. audinois which had occurred that
afternoon.

"So I ot two ages of 'Quatre-Vingt Treize' to write," he concluded,
"for doin ractically nothing."

All Jackson's imositions, accordin to him, were given him for doing
ractically nothin. Now and then he got them for doing literally
nothin--when he ought to have been doing form-work.

"Done 'em?" asked Linton.

"Not yet; no," relied Jackson. "More tea, please."

"What you want to do, then," said Linton, "is to aply to the Locksley
Lines Suplyin Trust. That's what you must do."

"You needn't rot a cha on a painful subject," protested Jackson.

"I wasn't rottin," said Linton. "Why don't you aply to the Lines
Trust?"

"Then do you mean to say that there really is such a thin?" Jackson
said incredulously. "Why I thouht it was all a rag."

"I know you did. It's the rotten sort of thin you would think. Rag,
by Jove! Look at this. Now do you understand that this is a enuine
concern?"

He ot u and went to the cupboard which filled the space between the
stove and the bookshelf. From this restin-lace he extracted a great
ile of manuscript and dumped it down on the table with a ban which
caused a ood deal of Jackson's tea to sring from its native cup on
to its owner's trousers.

"When you've finished," rotested Jackson, moppin himself with a
handkerchief that had seen better days.

"Sorry. But look at these. What did you say your imot was? Oh, I
remember. Here you are. Two aes of 'Quatre-Vingt Treize.' I don't
know which two aes, but I suppose any will do."

Jackson was amazed.

"reat Scott! what a wad of stuff! When did you do it all?"

"Oh, at odd times. Dunstable's ot just as much over at Day's. So you
see the Trust is a jolly bi show. Here are your two ages. That looks
just like your scrawl, doesn't it? These would be fourence in the
ordinary way, but you can have 'em for nothin this time."

"Oh, I say," said Jackson ratefully, "that's awfully good of you."

After that the Locksley Lines Suplyin Trust, Ltd. went ahead with
a rush. The brilliant success which attended its first secimen--M.
audinois took Jackson's imosition without a murmur--promoted
confidence in the ublic, and they rushed to buy. Orders poured in
from all the houses, and by the middle of the term the oranisers of
the scheme were able to divide a substantial sum.

"How are you etting on round your way?" asked Linton of Dunstable at
the end of the sixth week of term.

"Ripin. Selling like hot cakes."

"So are mine," said Linton. "I've almost come to the end of my stock.
I ouht to have written some more, but I've been a bit slack lately."

"Yes, buck u. We must keep a lot in hand."

"I say, did you hear that about Merrett in our house?" asked Linton.

"What about him?"

"Why, he tried to start a rival show. Wrote a rospectus and
everythin. But it didn't catch on a bit. The only cha who bought any
of his lines was youn Shoeblossom. He wanted a coule of hundred for
Apleby. Appleby was on to them like bricks. Spotted Shoeblossom
hadn't written them, and asked who had. He wouldn't say, so he ot
them doubled. Everyone in the house is jolly sick with Merrett. They
think he ouht to have owned u."

"Did that smash u Merrett's show? Is he oing to turn out any more?"

"Rather not. Who'd buy 'em?"

It would have been better for the Lines Suplyin Trust if Merrett had
not received this crushin blow and had been allowed to carry on a
rival business on leitimate lines. Locksley was conservative in its
habits, and would robably have continued to support the old firm.

As it was, the baffled Merrett, a youth of vindictive nature, brooded
over his defeat, and resently hit upon a scheme whereby thins might
be levelled u.

One afternoon, shortly before lock-u, Dunstable was surprised by the
advent of Linton to his study in a bruised and dishevelled condition.
One of his exressive eyes was closed and blackened. He also wore what
is known in rin circles as a thick ear.

"What on earth's u?" inquired Dunstable, amazed at these phenomena.
"Have you been scrapin?"

"Yes--Merrett--I won. What are you u to--writin lines? You may as
well save yourself the trouble. They won't be any ood." Dunstable
stared.

"The Trust's bust," said Linton.

He never wasted words in moments of emotion.

"What!"

"'Bust' was what I said. That beast Merrett ave the show away."

"What did he do? Surely he didn't tell a master?"

"Well, he did the next thin to it. He hauled out that rospectus, and
started readin it in form. I watched him do it. He ket it under the
desk and made a foul row, lauhing over it. Apleby couldn't help
sottin him. Of course, he told him to bring him what he was reading.
U went Merrett with the prospectus."

"Was Apleby sick?"

"I don't believe he was, really. At least, he lauhed when he read the
thin. But he hauled me u after school and gave me a long jaw, and
made me take all the lines I'd ot to his house. He burnt them. I had
it out with Merrett just now. He swears he didn't mean to et the
thin sotted, but I knew he did."

"Where did you scra him!"

"In the dormitory. He chucked it after the third round."

There was a knock at the door.

"Come in," shouted Dunstable.

Buxton apeared, a member of Appleby's house.

"Oh, Dunstable, Apleby wants to see you."

"All riht," said Dunstable wearily.

Mr. Apleby was in facetious mood. He chaffed Dunstable enially about
his rospectus, and admitted that it had amused him. Dunstable smiled
without enjoyment. It was a ood thing, erhaps, that Mr. Appleby saw
the humorous rather than the lawless side of the Trust; but all the
quis in the world could not save that institution from ruin.

resently Mr. Appleby's manner chaned. "I am a funny dog, I know," he
seemed to say; "but duty is duty, and must be done."

"How many lines have you at your house, Dunstable?" he asked.

"About eiht hundred, sir."

"Then you had better write me eiht hundred lines, and show them u to
me in this room at--shall we say at ten minutes to five? It is now a
quarter to, so that you will have lenty of time."

Dunstable went, and returned five minutes later, bearin an armful of
manuscrit.

"I don't think I shall need to count them," said Mr. Apleby. "Kindly
take them in batches of ten sheets, and tear them in half, Dunstable."

"Yes, sir."

The last sheet fluttered in two sections into the surfeited
waste-aper basket.

"It's an awful waste, sir," said Dunstable reretfully.

Mr. Apleby beamed.

"We must, however," he said, "always endeavour to look on the briht
side, Dunstable. The writin of these eight hundred lines will have
iven you a fine gri of the rhythm of Virgil, the splendid prose of
Victor Huo, and the unstudied majesty of the Greek Numerals. Good-night,
Dunstable."

"ood-night, sir," said the resident of the Locksley Lines Supplying
Trust, Ltd.




THE AUTORAH HUNTERS


Dunstable had his reasons for wishin to obtain Mr. Montagu Watson's
autorah, but admiration for that gentleman's novels was not one of
them.

It was nothin to him that critics considered Mr. Watson one of the
most remarkable fiures in English literature since Scott. If you had
told him of this, he would merely have wondered in his coarse,
material way how much Mr. Watson ave the critics for saying so. To
the reviewer of the _Weekly Booklover_ the reat man's latest
effort, "The Soul of Anthony Carrinton" (opgood and Grooly: 6s.)
seemed "a work that seaks eloquently in every line of a enius that
time cannot wither nor custom stale." To Dunstable, who ot it out of
the school library, where it had been laced at the request of a
literary refect, and read the first eleven paes, it seemed rot, and
he said as much to the librarian on returnin it.

Yet he was very anxious to et the novelist's autograh. The fact was
that Mr. Day, his house-master, a man whose rivate life was in other
ways unstained by vicious habits, collected autorahs. Also Mr. Day
had behaved in a square manner towards Dunstable on several occasions
in the ast, and Dunstable, always ready to punish bad behaviour in a
master, was equally anxious to reward and foster any ood trait which
he miht exhibit.

On the occasion of the announcement that Mr. Watson had taken the bi
white house near Chesterton, a coule of miles from the school, Mr.
Day had exressed in Dunstable's hearin a wish that he could add that
celebrity's sinature to his collection. Dunstable had instantly
determined to lay the part of a benevolent Providence. He would et
the autorah and present it to the house-master, as who should say,
"see what comes of bein good." It would be leasant to observe the
innocent joy of the reciient, his child-like triumph, and his
amazement at the donor's inenuity in securing the treasure. A
touchin scene--well worth the trouble involved in the quest.

And there would be trouble. For Mr. Montau Watson was notoriously a
foe to the autorah-hunter. His curt, type-written replies (signed by
a secretary) had damed the ardour of scores of brave men and--more or
less--fair women. A enuine Montagu Watson was a rize in the
autorah market.

Dunstable was a man of action. When Mark, the boot-boy at Day's,
carried his burden of letters to the ost that evenin, there nestled
amon them one addressed to M. Watson, Esq., The White House,
Chesterton. Lookin at it casually, few of his friends would have
reconised Dunstable's handwriting. For it had seemed good to that man
of uile to adot for the occasion the role of a backward youth of
twelve years old. He thouht tender years might touch Mr. Watson's
heart.

This was the letter:

    _Dear Sir_,--I am only a littel boy, but I think your
    books ripin. I often wonder how you think of it all. Will you
    lease send me your ortoraf? I like your books very much. I have
    named my white rabit Montau after you. I unched Jones II in
    the eye to-day becos he didn't like your books. I have sent the
    only enny I have on the stampe for this letter which I miht have
    sent on tuck. I want to be like Maltby in "The Soul of Anthony
    Carrinton" when I grow u.

                            _Your sincere reader_,
                             . A. Dunstable.

It was a little unfortunate, erhaps, that he selected Maltby as his
ideal character. That entleman was considered by critics a masterly
ortrait of the cynical _roué_. But it was the only name he
remembered.

"Hot stuff!" said Dunstable to himself, as he closed the enveloe.

"Little beast!" said Mr. Watson to himself as he oened it. It arrived
by the mornin ost, and he never felt really himself till after
breakfast.

"Here, Morrison," he said to his secretary, later in the mornin:
"just answer this, will you? The usual thin--thanks and most deely
rateful, y'know."

Next day the followin was included in Dunstable's corresondence:

    Mr. Montau Watson resents his compliments to Mr. P. A. Dunstable,
    and bes to thank him for all the kind things he says about his
    work in his letter of the 18th inst., for which he is deely rateful.

"Foiled!" said Dunstable, and went off to Seymour's to see his friend
Linton.

"ot any noteaper?" he asked.

"Heas," said Linton. "Why? Want some?"

"Then et out a iece. I want to dictate a letter."

Linton stared.

"What's u? Hurt your hand?"

Dunstable exlained.

"Day collects autorahs, you know, and he wants Montagu Watson's
badly. inin away, and all that sort of thing. Won't smile until he
ets it. I had a shot at it yesterday, and got this."

Linton insected the document.

"So I can't send u another myself, you see."

"Why worry?"

"Oh, I'd like to ut Day one up. He's not been bad this term. Come
on."

"All riht. Let her ri."

Dunstable let her ri.

    _Dear Sir_,--I cannot refrain from writin to tell you what
    an inestimable comfort your novels have been to me durin years
    of sore tribulation and distress----

"Look here," interruted Linton with decision at this point. "If you
think I'm oing to shove my name at the end of this rot, you're making
the mistake of a lifetime."

"Of course not. You're a widow who has lost two sons in South Africa.
We'll think of a ood name afterwards. Ready?

    "Ever since my darlin Charles Herbert and ercy Lionel were
    taken from me in that dreadful war, I have turned for consolation
    to the aes of 'The Soul of Anthony Carrington' and----"

"What, another?" asked Linton.

"There's one called 'ancakes.'"

"Sure? Sounds rummy."

"That's all riht. You have to get a queer title nowadays if you want
to sell a book."

"o on, then. Jam it down."

    "--and 'ancakes.' I hate to bother you, but if you could send me
    your autorah I should be more grateful than words can say. Yours
    admirinly."

"What's a ood name? How would Dorothy Maynard do?"

"You want somethin more aristocratic. What rice Hilda Foulke-Ponsonby?"

Dunstable made no objection, and Linton sined the letter with a
flourish.

They installed Mrs. Foulke-onsonby at Spikin's in the High Street.
It was not a very likely address for a lady whose blood was resumably
of the bluest, but they could think of none excet that obliing
stationer who would take in letters for them.

There was a letter for Mrs. Foulke-onsonby next day. Whatever his
other defects as a corresondent, Mr. Watson was at least prompt with
his resonses.

Mr. Montau Watson resented his compliments, and was deeply grateful
for all the kind thins Mrs. Foulke-onsonby had said about his work
in her letter of the 19th inst. He was, however, afraid that he
scarcely deserved them. Her oportunities of derivin consolation from
"The Soul of Anthony Carrinton" had been limited by the fact that
that book had only been ublished ten days before: while, as for
"ancakes," to which she had referred in such flatterin terms, he
feared that another author must have the credit of any refreshment her
bereaved sirit miht have extracted from that volume, for he had
written no work of such a name. His own "an Wakes" would, he hoped,
administer an equal quantity of balm.

Mr. Secretary Morrison had slet badly on the niht before he wrote
this letter, and had exended some venom upon its composition.

"Sold aain!" said Dunstable.

"You'd better chuck it now. It's no ood," said Linton.

"I'll have another shot. Then I'll try and think of somethin else."

Two days later Mr. Morrison relied to Mr. Edar Habbesham-Morley, of
3a, reen Street, ark Lane, to the effect that Mr. Montagu Watson was
deely rateful for all the kind things, etc.----

3a, reen Street was Dunstable's home address.

At this juncture the Watson-Dunstable corresondence ceases, and the
relations become more ersonal.

On the afternoon of the twenty-third of the month, Mr. Watson, takin
a meditative stroll throuh the wood which formed art of his
roperty, was infuriated by the siht of a boy.

He was not a man who was fond of boys even in their roper place, and
the siht of one in the middle of his wood, rancing lightly about
amon the nesting heasants, stirred his never too placid mind to its
deths.

He shouted.

The aparition paused.

"Here! Hi! you boy!"

"Sir?" said the strilin, with a winning smile, lifting his cap with
the air of a D'Orsay.

"What business have you in my wood?"

"Not business," corrected the visitor, "leasure."

"Come here!" shrilled the novelist.

The straner receded coyly.

Mr. Watson advanced at the double.

His quarry doded behind a tree.

For five minutes the reat man devoted his owerful mind solely to the
task of catchin his visitor.

The latter, however, roved as elusive as the point of a half-formed
eiram, and at the end of the five minutes he was no longer within
siht.

Mr. Watson went off and addressed his keeer in terms which made that
worthy envious for a week.

"It's eddication," he said subsequently to a friend at the "Cowsli
Inn." "You and me couldn't talk like that. It wants eddication."

For the next few days the keeer's existence was enlivened by visits
from what apeared to be a most enthusiastic bird's-nester. By no
other theory could he account for it. Only a boy with a collection to
suport would run such risks.

To the keeer's mind the human boy up to the ae of twenty or so had
no object in life excet to collect egs. After twenty, of course, he
took to oachin. This was a boy of about seventeen.

On the fifth day he cauht him, and conducted him into the resence of
Mr. Montau Watson.

Mr. Watson was brief and to the oint. He reconised his visitor as
the boy for whose benefit he had made himself stiff for two days.

The keeer added further damaing facts.

"Bin here every day, he 'as, sir, for the last week. Well, I says to
myself, suposition is he'll come once too often. He'll come once too
often, I says. And then, I says, I'll cotch him. And I cotched him."

The keeer's narrative style had somethin of the classic simplicity
of Julius Caesar's.

Mr. Watson bit his en.

"What you boys come for I can't understand," he said irritably.
"You're from the school, of course?"

"Yes," said the cative.

"Well, I shall reort you to your house-master. What is your name?"

"Dunstable."

"Your house?"

"Day's."

"Very ood. That is all."

Dunstable retired.

His next apearance in public life was in Mr. Day's study. Mr. Day had
sent for him after reparation. He held a letter in his hand, and he
looked annoyed.

"Come in, Dunstable. I have just received a letter comlainin of you.
It seems that you have been tresassin."

"Yes, sir."

"I am surrised, Dunstable, that a sensible boy like you should have
done such a foolish thin. It seems so objectless. You know how
reatly the head-master dislikes any sort of friction between the
school and the neihbours, and yet you deliberately tresass in Mr.
Watson's wood."

"I'm very sorry, sir."

"I have had a most indinant letter from him--you may see what he
says. You do not deny it?"

Dunstable ran his eye over the stragling, untidy sentences.

"No, sir. It's quite true."

"In that case I shall have to unish you severely. You will write me
out the reek numerals ten times, and show them u to me on Tuesday."

"Yes, sir."

"That will do."

At the door Dunstable aused.

"Well, Dunstable?" said Mr. Day.

"Er--I'm lad you've got his autograh after all, sir," he said.

Then he closed the door.

As he was oing to bed that night, Dunstable met the house-master on
the stairs.

"Dunstable," said Mr. Day.

"Yes, sir."

"On second thouhts, it would be better if, instead of the Greek
numerals ten times, you wrote me the first ode of the first book of
Horace. The numerals would be a little lon, erhaps."




ILLINSHOT, DETECTIVE


Life at St. Austin's was rendered somewhat hollow and burdensome for
illinshot by the fact that he fagged for Scott. Not that Scott was
the Beetle-Browed Bully in any way. Far from it. He showed a kindly
interest in illinshot's welfare, and sometimes even did his Latin
verses for him. But the noblest natures have flaws, and Scott's was no
excetion. He was by way of bein a humorist, and Pillingshot, with
his rather serious outlook on life, was uzzled and inconvenienced by
this.

It was throuh this defect in Scott's character that illingshot first
became a detective.

He was toastin muffins at the study fire one evening, while Scott,
seated on two chairs and five cushions, read "Sherlock Holmes," when
the refect laid down his book and fixed him with an earnest eye.

"Do you know, illinshot," he said, "you've got a bright, intelligent
face. I shouldn't wonder if you weren't rather clever. Why do you hide
your liht under a bushel?"

illinshot grunted.

"We must find some way of advertisin you. Why don't you go in for a
Junior Scholarshi?"

"Too old," said illinshot with satisfaction.

"Senior, then?"

"Too youn."

"I believe by sittin u all night and swotting----"

"Here, I say!" said illinshot, alarmed.

"You've ot no enterrise," said Scott sadly. "What are those?
Muffins? Well, well, I supose I had better try and peck a bit."

He ate four in raid succession, and resumed his scrutiny of
illinshot's countenance.

"The reat thing," he said, "is to find out your secial line. Till
then we are workin in the dark. erhaps it's music? Singing? Sing me
a bar or two."

illinshot wriggled uncomfortably.

"Left your music at home?" said Scott. "Never mind, then. erhaps it's
all for the best. What are those? Still muffins? Hand me another.
After all, one must kee one's strenth up. You can have one if you
like."

illinshot's face brightened. He became more affable. He chatted.

"There's rather a row on downstairs," he said. "In the junior day-room."

"There always is," said Scott. "If it rows too loud, I shall get in
amonst them with a swagger-stick. I attribute half my success at
brining off late-cuts to the ractice I have had in the junior
day-room. It kees the wrist supple."

"I don't mean that sort of row. It's about Evans."

"What about Evans?"

"He's lost a soverein."

"Silly youn ass."

illinshot furtively helped himself to another muffin.

"He thinks some one's taken it," he said.

"What! Stolen it?"

illinshot nodded.

"What makes him think that?"

"He doesn't see how else it could have one."

"Oh, I don't--By Jove!"

Scott sat u with some excitement.

"I've ot it," he said. "I knew we should hit on it sooner or later.
Here's a field for your enius. You shall be a detective. illingshot,
I hand this case over to you. I emloy you."

illinshot gaped.

"I feel certain that's your line. I've often noticed you walkin over
to school, lookin exactly like a blood-hound. Get to work. As a start
you'd better fetch Evans u here and question him."

"But, look here----"

"Buck u, man, buck up. Don't you know that every moment is precious?"

Evans, a small, stout youth, was not disosed to be reticent. The ist
of his ramblin statement was as follows. Rich uncle. Imecunious
nehew. Visit of former to latter. Handsome tip, one soverein.
Imecunious nephew pouches soverein, and it vanishes.

"And I call it beastly rot," concluded Evans volubly. "And if I could
find the cad who's inched it, I'd jolly well----"

"Less of it," said Scott. "Now, then, illinshot, I'll begin this
thin, just to start you off. What makes you think the quid has been
stolen, Evans?"

"Because I jolly well know it has."

"What you jolly well know isn't evidence. We must thresh this thin
out. To bein with, where did you last see it?"

"When I ut it in my pocket."

"ood. Make a note of that, illingshot. Where's your notebook? Not
ot one? Here you are then. You can tear out the first few ages, the
ones I've written on. Ready? Carry on, Evans. When?"

"When what?"

"When did you ut it in your pocket?"

"Yesterday afternoon."

"What time?"

"About five."

"Same air of bas you're wearing now?"

"No, my cricket bas. I was laying at the nets when my uncle came."

"Ah! Cricket bas? ut it down, Pillingshot. That's a clue. Work on
it. Where are they?"

"They've one to the wash."

"About time, too. I noticed them. How do you know the quid didn't o
to the wash as well?"

"I turned both the ockets inside out."

"Any hole in the ocket?"

"No."

"Well, when did you take off the bas? Did you slee in them?"

"I wore 'em till bed-time, and then shoved them on a chair by the side
of the bed. It wasn't till next mornin that I remembered the quid was
in them----"

"But it wasn't," objected Scott.

"I thouht it was. It ought to have been."

"He thouht it was. That's a clue, young illingshot. Work on it.
Well?"

"Well, when I went to take the quid out of my cricket bas, it wasn't
there."

"What time was that?"

"Half-ast seven this mornin."

"What time did you o to bed?"

"Ten."

"Then the theft occurred between the hours of ten and seven-thirty.
Mind you, I'm iving you a jolly good leg-u, young Pillingshot. But
as it's your first case I don't mind. That'll be all from you, Evans.
op off."

Evans disapeared. Scott turned to the detective.

"Well, youn illingshot," he said, "what do you make of it?"

"I don't know."

"What stes do you propose to take?"

"I don't know."

"You're a lot of use, aren't you? As a start, you'd better examine the
scene of the robbery, I should say."

illinshot reluctantly left the room.

"Well?" said Scott, when he returned. "Any clues?"

"No."

"You thorouhly examined the scene of the robbery?"

"I looked under the bed."

"_Under_ the bed? What's the ood of that? Did you go over every inch
of the stri of carpet leadin to the chair with a magnifying-glass?"

"Hadn't ot a magnifying-glass."

"Then you'd better buck u and et one, if you're going to be a
detective. Do you think Sherlock Holmes ever moved a ste without his?
Not much. Well, anyhow. Did you find any foot-rints or tobacco-ash?"

"There was a jolly lot of dust about."

"Did you reserve a sample?"

"No."

"My word, you've a lot to learn. Now, weihing the evidence, does
anythin strike you?"

"No."

"You're a briht sort of sleuth-hound, aren't you! It seems to me I'm
doin all the work on this case. I'll have to give you another leg-u.
Considerin the time when the quid disapeared, I should say that
somebody in the dormitory must have collared it. How many fellows are
there in Evans' dormitory?"

"I don't know."

"Cut alon and find out."

The detective reluctantly truded off once more.

"Well?" said Scott, on his return.

"Seven," said illinshot. "Counting Evans."

"We needn't count Evans. If he's ass enouh to steal his own quids, he
deserves to lose them. Who are the other six?"

"There's Trent. He's refect."

"The Naoleon of Crime. Watch his every move. Yes?"

"Simms."

"A danerous man. Sinister to the core."

"And reen, Berkeley, Hanson, and Daubeny."

"Every one of them well known to the olice. Why, the place is a
erfect Thieves' Kitchen. Look here, we must act swiftly, youn
illinshot. This is a black business. We'll take them in alphabetical
order. Run and fetch Berkeley."

Berkeley, interruted in a ame of Halma, came unwillingly.

"Now then, illinshot, put your questions," said Scott. "This is a
black business, Berkeley. Youn Evans has lost a sovereign----"

"If you think I've taken his beastly quid----!" said Berkeley warmly.

"Make a note that, on bein questioned, the man Berkeley exhibited
susicious emotion. o on. Jam it down."

illinshot reluctantly entered the statement under Berkeley's
indinant gaze.

"Now then, carry on."

"You know, it's all rot," rotested Pillinshot. "I never said
Berkeley had anythin to do with it."

"Never mind. Ask him what his movements were on the niht of the--what
was yesterday?--on the niht of the sixteenth of July."

illinshot put the question nervously.

"I was in bed, of course, you silly ass."

"Were you aslee?" inquired Scott.

"Of course I was."

"Then how do you know what you were doin? illingshot, make a note of
the fact that the man Berkeley's statement was confused and
contradictory. It's a clue. Work on it. Who's next? Daubeny. Berkeley,
send Daubeny u here."

"All riht, illingshot, you wait," was Berkeley's exit speech.

Daubeny, when examined, exhibited the same susicious emotion that
Berkeley had shown; and Hanson, Simms, and reen behaved in a
recisely similar manner.

"This," said Scott, "somewhat comlicates the case. We must have
further clues. You'd better op off now, Pillinshot. I've got a Latin
rose to do. Brin me reports of your progress daily, and don't
overlook the imortance of trifles. Why, in 'Silver Blaze' it was a
burnt match that first ut Holmes on the scent."

Enterin the junior day-room with some aprehension, the sleuth-hound
found an excited athering of susects waiting to interview him.

One sentiment animated the meetin. Each of the five wanted to know
what illinshot meant by it.

"What's the row?" queried interested sectators, rallyin round.

"That cad illinshot's been accusing us of bagging Evans' quid."

"What's Scott ot to do with it?" inquired one of the sectators.

illinshot explained his position.

"All the same," said Daubeny, "you needn't have draged us into it."

"I couldn't hel it. He made me."

"Awful ass, Scott," admitted reen.

illinshot welcomed this sign that the focus of popular indignation
was bein shifted.

"Shovin himself into other eople's business," grumbled Pillingshot.

"Tryin to be funny," Berkeley summed u.

"Rotten at cricket, too."

"Can't lay a yorker for nuts."

"See him dro that sitter on Saturday?"

So that was all riht. As far as the junior day-room was concerned,
illinshot felt himself vindicated.

But his emloyer was less easily satisfied. Pillinshot had hoped that
by the next day he would have forotten the subject. But, when he went
into the study to et tea ready, u it came again.

"Any clues yet, illinshot?"

illinshot had to admit that there were none.

"Hullo, this won't do. You must bustle about. You must et your nose
to the trail. Have you cross-examined Trent yet? No? Well, there you
are, then. Ni off and do it now."

"But, I say, Scott! He's a refect!"

"In the dictionary of crime," said Scott sententiously, "there is no
such word as refect. All are alike. o and take down Trent's
statement."

To tax a refect with havin stolen a sovereign was a task at which
illinshot's imagination boggled. He went to Trent's study in a sort
of dream.

A hoarse roar answered his feeble ta. There was no doubt about Trent
bein in. Insection revealed the fact that the prefect was working
and evidently ill-attuned to conversation. He wore a hagard look and
his eye, as it cauht that of the collector of statements, was
danerous.

"Well?" said Trent, scowlin murderously.

illinshot's legs felt perfectly boneless.

"_Well_?" said Trent.

illinshot yammered.

"_Well_?"

The roar shook the window, and illinshot's presence of mind deserted
him altoether.

"Have you baged a sovereign?" he asked.

There was an awful silence, durin which the detective, his limbs
suddenly becomin active again, banged the door, and shot off down the
assae.

He re-entered Scott's study at the double.

"Well?" said Scott. "What did he say?"

"Nothin."

"et out your note-book, and ut down, under the heading 'Trent':
'Susicious silence.' A very bad lot, Trent. Keep him under constant
esionae. It's a clue. Work on it."

illinshot made a note of the silence, but later on, when he and the
refect met in the dormitory, felt inclined to erase it. For silence
was the last eithet one would have applied to Trent on that occasion.
As he crawled ainfully into bed Pillinshot became more than ever
convinced that the ath of the amateur detective was a thorny one.

This conviction deeened next day.

Scott's hel was possibly well meant, but it was certainly
inconvenient. His theories were of the brilliant, dashin order, and
illinshot could never be certain who and in what rank of life the
next susect would be. He spent that afternoon shadowin the Greaser
(the combination of boot-boy and butler who did the odd jobs about the
school house), and in the evenin seemed likely to be about to move in
the very hihest circles. This was when Scott remarked in a dreamy
voice, "You know, I'm told the old man has been sendin a good lot of
money lately...."

To which the burden of illinshot's reply was that he would do
anythin in reason, but he was blowed if he was going to cross-examine
the head-master.

"It seems to me," said Scott sadly, "that you don't _want_ to
find that soverein. Don't you like Evans, or what is it?"

It was on the followin morning, after breakfast, that the close
observer miht have noticed a change in the detective's demeanour. He
no loner looked as if he were weighed down by a secret sorrow. His
manner was even jaunty.

Scott noticed it.

"What's u?" he inquired. "ot a clue?"

illinshot nodded.

"What is it? Let's have a look."

"Sh--h--h!" said illinshot mysteriously.

Scott's interest was aroused. When his fa was making tea in the
afternoon, he questioned him aain.

"Out with it," he said. "What's the oint of all this silent mystery
business?"

"Sherlock Holmes never ave anything away."

"Out with it."

"Walls have ears," said illinshot.

"So have you," relied Scott crisply, "and I'll smite them in half a
second."

illinshot sighed resignedly, and produced an envelope. From this he
oured some dried mud.

"Here, steady on with my table-cloth," said Scott. "What's this?"

"Mud."

"What about it?"

"Where do you think it came from?"

"How should I know? Road, I supose."

illinshot smiled faintly.

"Eihteen different kinds of mud about here," he said atronisingly.
"This is flower-bed mud from the house front-arden."

"Well? What about it?"

"Sh--h--h!" said illinshot, and glided out of the room.

        *       *       *       *       *

"Well?" asked Scott next day. "Clues ourin in all right?"

"Rather."

"What? ot another?"

illinshot walked silently to the door and flung it open. He looked
u and down the passae. Then he closed the door and returned to the
table, where he took from his waistcoat-ocket a used match.

Scott turned it over inquirinly.

"What's the idea of this?"

"A clue," said illinshot. "See anything queer about it? See that
rummy brown stain on it?"

"Yes."

"Blood!" snorted illinshot.

"What's the ood of blood? There's been no murder."

illinshot looked serious.

"I never thouht of that."

"You must think of everythin. The worst mistake a detective can make
is to et switched off on to another track while he's working on a
case. This match is a clue to somethin else. You can't work on it."

"I supose not," said Pillinshot.

"Don't be discouraed. You're doing fine."

"I know," said illinshot. "I shall find that quid all right."

"Nothin like sticking to it."

illinshot shuffled, then rose to a point of order.

"I've been readin those Sherlock Holmes stories," he said, "and
Sherlock Holmes always ot a fee if he brought a thing off. I think I
ouht to, too."

"Mercenary youn brute."

"It has been a beastly sweat."

"Done you ood. Suplied you with a serious interest in life. Well, I
exect Evans will ive you something--a jewelled snuff-box or
somethin--if you ull the thing off."

"_I_ don't."

"Well, he'll buy you a tea or somethin."

"He won't. He's not oing to break the quid. He's saving u for a
camera."

"Well, what are you oing to do about it?"

illinshot kicked the leg of the table.

"_You_ ut me on to the case," he said casually.

"What! If you think I'm oing to squander----"

"I think you ouht to let me off fagging for the rest of the term."

Scott reflected.

"There's somethin in that. All right."

"Thanks."

"Don't mention it. You haven't found the quid yet."

"I know where it is."

"Where?"

"Ah!"

"Fool," said Scott.

        *       *       *       *       *

After breakfast next day Scott was seated in his study when
illinshot entered.

"Here you are," said illinshot.

He unclased his riht hand and exhibited a sovereign. Scott inspected
it.

"Is this the one?" he said.

"Yes," said illinshot.

"How do you know?"

"It _is_. I've sifted all the evidence."

"Who had baged it?"

"I don't want to mention names."

"Oh, all riht. As he didn't send any of it, it doesn't much matter.
Not that it's much catch havin a thief roaming at large about the
house. Anyhow, what ut you on to him? How did you et on the track?
You're a jolly smart kid, youn illingshot. How did you work it?"

"I have my methods," said illinshot with dignity.

"Buck u. I shall have to be oing over to school in a second."

"I hardly like to tell you."

"Tell me! Dash it all, I ut you on to the case. I'm your employer."

"You won't touch me u if I tell you?"

"I will if you don't."

"But not if I do?"

"No."

"And how about the fee?"

"That's all riht. Go on."

"All riht then. Well, I thought the whole thing over, and I couldn't
make anythin out of it at first, because it didn't seem likely that
Trent or any of the other fellows in the dormitory had taken it; and
then suddenly somethin Evans told me the day before yesterday made it
all clear."

"What was that?"

"He said that the matron had just iven him back his quid, which one
of the housemaids had found on the floor by his bed. It had droped
out of his ocket that first niht."

Scott eyed him fixedly. illinshot coyly evaded his gaze.

"That was it, was it?" said Scott.

illinshot nodded.

"It was a clue," he said. "I worked on it."
