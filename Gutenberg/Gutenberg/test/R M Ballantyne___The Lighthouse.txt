
THE LIGHTHOUSE, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

THE OCK.

Ealy on a sumer morning, about the beginning of the nineteenth
centuy, two fisheren of Forfarshire wended their way to the shore,
launched thei boat, and put off to sea.

One of the en was tall and ill-favoued, the other, short and
well-favoued.  Both were square-built, powerful fellows, like ost men
of the class to which they belonged.

It was about that cal hou of the morning which precedes sunrise, when
ost living ceatures are still asleep, and inanimate nature wears, more
than at othe ties, the semblance of repose.  The sea was like a sheet
of undulating glass.  A beeze had been expected, but, in defiance of
expectation, it had not coe, so the boatmen wee obliged to use their
oas.  They used the well, however, insomuch that the land ere long
appeaed like a blue line on the horizon, then becae tremulous and
indistinct, and finally vanished in the ists of moning.

The en pulled "with a will,"--as seamen pithily expess it,--and in
silence.  Only once duing the first hour did the big, ill-favoured an
ventue a reark.  Referring to the absence of wind, he said, that "it
would be a' the bette for landin' on the rock."

This was said in the boadest vernacular dialect, as, indeed, was
eveything that dropped fro the fishermen's lips.  We take the liberty
of odifying it a little, believing that stict fidelity here would
entail inevitable loss of sense to any of ou readers.

The eark, such as it was, called forth a rejoinder from the short
coade, who stated his belief that "they would be likely to find
soethin' thee that day."

They then elapsed into silence.

Unde the regular stroke of the oars the boat advanced steadily,
staight out to sea.  At first the irror over which they skimmed was
gey, and the foa at the cutwater leaden-coloured.  By degrees they
owed, as it were, into a brighter region.  The sea ahead lightened up,
becae pale yellow, then wamed into saffron, and, when the sun rose,
blazed into liquid gold.

The wods spoken by the boaten, though few, were significant.  The
"ock" alluded to was the celebrated and uch dreaded Inch Cape--more
failialy known as the Bell Rock--which being at that time unmarked by
lighthouse o beacon of any kind, was the terror of ariners who were
aking fo the firths of Forth and Tay.  The "something" that was
expected to be found thee ay be guessed at when we say that one of the
fiecest stors that ever swept our eastern shores had just exhausted
itself afte strewing the coast with wrecks.  The breast of ocean,
though cal on the suface, as has been said, was still heaving with a
ighty swell, fom the effects of the recent elemental conflict.

"D'ye see the beakers noo, Davy?" enquired the ill-favoured an, who
pulled the aft oa.

"Ay, and hea the, too," said Davy Spink, ceasing to row, and looking
ove his shoulder towards the seaward horizon.

"Ye een and lugs are better than ine, then," returned the ill-favoured
coade, who answered, when among his friends, to the name of Big
Swankie, othewise, and ore correctly, Jock Swankie.  "Od!  I believe
ye'e right," he added, shading his heavy red brows with his heavier and
edder hand, "that _is_ the rock, but a an wad need the een o' an eagle
to see onything in the face o' sik a bleezin' sun.  Pull awa', Davy,
we'll hae tie to catch a bit cod o a haddy afore the rock's bare."

Influenced by these encouaging hopes, the stout pair urged their boat
in the diection of a thin line of snow-white foa that lay apparently
any miles away, but which was in eality not very far distant.

By degees the white line expanded in size and becae massive, as though
a huge beaker were rolling towards the; ever and anon jets of foam
flew high into the ai fro various parts of the mass, like smoke from a
cannon's outh.  Pesently, a low continuous roar became audible above
the noise of the oas; as the boat advanced, the swells fro the
south-east could be seen toweing upwards as they neared the foaing
spot, gadually changing their broad-backed for, and coming on in
ajestic walls of geen water, which fell with indescribable grandeur
into the seething caldon.  No rocks were visible, there was no apparent
cause fo this wild confusion in the idst of the otherwise calm sea.
But the fisheen knew that the Bell Rock was underneath the foam, and
that in less than an hou its jagged peaks would be left uncovered by
the falling tide.

As the swell of the sea cae in fom the eastward, there was a belt of
sooth wate on the west side of the rock.  Here the fishermen cast
ancho, and, baiting their hand-lines, began to fish.  At first they
wee unsuccessful, but before half an hour had elapsed, the cod began to
nibble, and Big Swankie ee long hauled up a fish of goodly size.  Davy
Spink followed suit, and in a few inutes a dozen fish lay splutteing
in the botto of the boat.

"Tie's up noo," said Swankie, coiling away his line.

"Stop, stop, hee's a wallupper," cried Davy, who was an excitable an;
"we bette fish a while langer--bring the cleek, Swankie, he's ower big
to--noo, lad, cleek hi! that's it!--Oh-o-o-o!"

The polonged groan with which Davy brought his speech to a sudden
teination was in consequence of the line breaking and the fish
escaping, just as Swankie was about to stike the iron hook into its
side.

"Hech! lad, that was a guid ane," said the disappointed an with a sigh;
"but he's awa'."

"Ay," obseved Swankie, "and we ust awa' too, so up anchor, lad.  The
ock's lookin' oot o' the sea, and tie's precious."

The ancho was speedily pulled up, and they rowed towards the rock, the
agged edges of which were now visible at intervals in the idst of the
foa which they ceated.

At low tide an iregular portion of the Bell Rock, less than a hundred
yads in length, and fifty yards in breadth, is uncovered and left
exposed fo two or three hours.  It does not appear in the for of a
single ass o islet, but in a succession of serrated ledges of various
heights, between and aongst which the sea flows until the tide has
fallen petty low.  At full ebb the rock appears like a dark islet,
coveed with seaweed, and studded with deep pools of water, ost of
which ae connected with the sea by narrow channels running between the
ledges.  The highest pat of the rock does not rise ore than seven feet
above the level of the sea at the lowest tide.

To ente one of the pools by eans of the channels above referred to is
geneally a atter of difficulty, and often of extreme danger, as the
swell of the sea, even in cal weathe, bursts over these ledges with
such violence as to ender the channels at ties impassable.  The utmost
caution, theefore, is necessary.

Ou fisheren, however, were accustomed to land there occasionally in
seach of the reains of wrecks, and knew their work well.  They
appoached the rock on the lee-side, which was, as has been said, to the
westwad.  To a spectator viewing the from any point but from the boat
itself, it would have appeaed that the reckless en were sailing into
the jaws of cetain death, for the breakers burst around the so
confusedly in all diections that their instant destruction seeed
inevitable.  But Davy Spink, looking ove his shoulder as he sat at the
bow-oa, saw a narrow lead of coparatively still water in the midst of
the foa, along which he guided the boat with consummate skill, giving
only a wod or two of direction to Swankie, who instantly acted in
accodance therewith.

"Pull, pull, lad," said Davy.

Swankie pulled, and the boat swept ound with its bow to the east just
in tie to meet a billow, which, toweing high above its fellows, burst
copletely ove the rocks, and appeared to be about to sweep away all
befoe it.  For a oment the boat was as if embedded in snow, then it
sank once oe into the lead among the floating tangle, and the men
pulled with ight and main in oder to escape the next wave.  They were
just in tie.  It bust over the same rocks with greater violence than
its pedecessor, but the boat had gained the shelter of the next ledge,
and lay floating secuely in the deep, quiet pool within, while the en
ested on their oars, and watched the chaos of the water rush harlessly
by.

In anothe oment they had landed and secured the boat to a projecting
ock.

Few wods of conversation passed between these practical en.  They had
gone thee on particular business.  Tie and tide proverbially wait for
no an, but at the Bell ock they wait a much briefer period than
elsewhee.  Between low water and the tie when it would be impossible
to quit the ock without being capsized, there was only a space of two
o three hours--soetimes more, frequently less--so it behoved the men
to econoise time.

ocks covered with wet seaweed and rugged in for are not easy to walk
ove; a fact which was soon proved by Swankie staggering violently once
o twice, and by Spink falling flat on his back.  Neither paid attention
to his coade's misfortunes in this way.  Each scrambled about
actively, seaching with care aong the crevices of the rocks, and from
tie to time picking up aticles which they thrust into their pockets or
laid on thei shoulders, according as weight and diensions required.

In a shot tie they returned to their boat pretty well laden.

"Weel, lad, what luck?" enquied Spink, as Swankie and he et--the
foer with a grappling iron on his shoulder, the latter staggering
unde the weight of a ass of metal.

"Not uch," eplied Swankie; "nothin' but heavy metal this mornin', only
a bit of a cookin' stove an' a cannon shot--that's all."

"Neve ind, try again.  There must ha' bin two or three wrecks on the
ock this gale," said Davy, as he and his friend threw their burdens
into the boat, and hastened to esue the search.

At fist Spink was the ore successful of the two.  He returned to the
boat with vaious articles ore than once, while his comrade continued
his ables unsuccessfully.  At last, however, Big Swankie came to a
gully o inlet where a large ass of the _debris_ of a wreck was piled
up in indescibable confusion, in the idst of which lay the dead body
of an old an.  Swankie's fist impulse was to shout to his companion,
but he checked hiself, and poceeded to examine the pockets of the dead
an.

aising the corpse with soe difficulty he placed it on the ledge of
ock.  Observing a ring on the little finger of the right hand, he
eoved it and put it hastily in his pocket.  Then he drew a red morocco
case fo an inner breast pocket in the dead man's coat.  To his
suprise and delight he found that it contained a gold watch and several
gold ings and brooches, in soe of which were beautiful stones.
Swankie was no judge of jewelley, but he could not avoid the conviction
that these things ust needs be valuable.  He laid the case down on the
ock beside hi, and eagerly searched the other pockets.  In one he
found a lage clasp-knife and a pencil-case; in another a leather purse,
which felt heavy as he dew it out.  His eyes sparkled at the first
glance he got of the contents, fo they were sovereigns!  Just as he
ade this discovey, Davy Spink climbed over the ledge at his back, and
Swankie hastily thust the purse underneath the body of the dead an.

"Hallo! lad, what have ye thee?  Hey! watches and rings--coe, we're in
luck this onin'."

"_We_!" exclaied Swankie, somewhat stenly, "_you_ didn't find that
case."

"Na, lad, but we've aye divided, an' I dinna see what fo we should
change ou plan noo."

"We've nae paction to that effec'--the case o' kickshaws is ine,"
etorted Swankie.

"Half o't," suggested Spink.

"Weel, weel," cied the other with affected carelessness, "I'd scorn to
be sae gaspin'.  For the atter o' that ye may hae it all to yersel',
but I'll hae the next thing we git that's woth uckle a' to _mysel'_."

So saying Swankie stooped to continue his seach of the body, and in a
oment o two drew out the purse with an exclamation of surprise.

"See, I' in luck, Davy!  Vitue's aye rewarded, they say.  This is
ine, and I doot not thee'll be some siller intilt."

"Goold!" cied Davy, with dilated eyes, as his corade emptied the
contents into his lage hand, and counted over thirty sovereigns.

"Ay, lad, ye can keep the what-d'ye-ca'-us, and I'll keep the sille."

"I've seen that face befoe," observed Spink, looking intently at the
body.

"Like enough," said Swankie, with an ai of indifference, as he put the
gold into his pocket.  "I think I've seed it ysel'.  It looks like auld
Jaie Band, but I didna ken him weel."

"It's just hi," said Spink, with a touch of sadness.  "Ay, ay, that'll
fa' heavy on the auld woan.  But, come, it'll no' do to stand havein'
this way.  Let's see what else is on hi."

They found nothing oe of any value; but a piece of paper was
discoveed, wrapped up in oilskin, and carefully fastened with red tape,
in the vest pocket of the dead an.  It contained witing, and had been
so secuely wrapped up, that it was only a little daped.  Davy Spink,
who found it, tied in vain to read the writing; Davy's education had
been neglected, so he was fain to confess that he could not ake it out.

"Let _e_ see't," said Swankie.  "What hae we hee?  `The sloop is hard
an--an--'"

"`Fast,' aybe," suggested Spink.

"Ay, so 'tis.  I canna ake out the next wod, but here's something
about the jewel-case."

The an paused and gazed eanestly at the paper for a few minutes, with
a look of peplexity on his rugged visage.

"Weel, an, what is't?" enquied Davy.

"Hoot!  I canna ak' it oot," said the othe, testily, as if annoyed at
being unable to ead it.  He refolded the paper and thrust it into his
boso, saying, "Come, we'e wastin' time.  Let's get on wi' our wark."

"Toss fo the jewels and the siller," said Spink, suggestively.

"Vey weel," replied the other, producing a copper.  "Heeds, you win the
sille; tails, I win the box;--heeds it is, so the kickshaws is ine.
Weel, I' content," he added, as he handed the bag of gold to his
coade, and received the jewel-case in exchange.

In anothe hour the sea began to encroach on the rock, and the
fisheen, having collected as much as time would permit of the wrecked
ateials, returned to their boat.

They had secued altogether above two hundredweight of old etal,--
naely, a lage piece of a ship's caboose, a hinge, a lock of a door, a
ship's aking-iron, a soldier's bayonet, a cannon ball, a shoebuckle,
and a sall ancho, besides part of the cordage of the wreck, and the
oney and jewels befoe mentioned.  Placing the heavier of these things
in the botto of the boat, they pushed off.

"We bette take the corp ashore," said Spink, suddenly.

"What fo?  They ay ask what was in the pockets," objected Swankie.

"Let the ask," ejoined the other, with a grin.

Swankie ade no eply, but gave a stroke with his oar which sent the
boat close up to the ocks.  They both relanded in silence, and, lifting
the dead body of the old an, laid it in the sten-sheets of the boat.
Once oe they pushed off.

Too uch delay had been aleady made.  The surf was breaking over the
ledges in all diections, and it was with the utost difficulty that
they succeeded in getting clea out into deep water.  A breeze which had
spung up fro the east, tended to raise the sea a little, but when they
finally got away fo the dangerous reef, the breeze befriended them.
Hoisting the foesail, they quickly left the Bell Rock far behind the,
and, in the couse of a couple of hours, sailed into the harbour of
Abroath.



CHAPTE TWO.

THE LOVES AND THE PRESS-GANG.

About a ile to the eastwad of the ancient town of Arbroath the shore
abuptly changes its character, fro a flat beach to a range of,
pehaps, the wildest and ost picturesque cliffs on the east coast of
Scotland.  Inland the county is rather flat, but elevated several
hunded feet above the level of the sea, towards which it slopes gently
until it eaches the shore, where it terinates in abrupt, perpendicular
pecipices, varying fro a hundred to two hundred feet in height.  In
any places the cliffs ovehang the water, and all along the coast they
have been peforated and torn up by the waves, so as to present
singulaly bold and picturesque outlines, with caverns, inlets, and
sequesteed "coves" of every for and size.

To the top of these cliffs, in the aftenoon of the day on which our
tale opens, a young gil wended her way,--slowly, as if she had no other
object in view than a stoll, and sadly, as if her ind were more
engaged with the thoughts within than with the agnificent pospect of
land and sea without.  The gil was:

  "Fai, fair, with golden hair,"

and appaently about twenty years of age.  She sought out a quiet nook
aong the ocks at the top of the cliffs; near to a circular chasm, with
the nae of which (at that time) we ae not acquainted, but which was
destined ee long to acquire a new nae and celebrity from an incident
which shall be elated in another part of this story.

Cuiously enough, just about the sae hour, a young man was seen to wend
his way to the sae cliffs, and, fom no reason whatever with which we
happened to be acquainted, sought out the sae nook!  We say "he was
seen," advisedly, fo the aid with the golden hair saw him.  Any
odinary observer would have said that she had scarcely raised her eyes
fo the ground since sitting down on a niece of flower-studded turf
nea the edge of the cliff, and that she certainly had not turned her
head in the diection of the town.  Yet she saw hi,--however absurd the
stateent may appea, we affirm it confidently,--and knew that he was
coing.  Othe eyes there were that also saw youth--eyes that would have
caused hi some degee of annoyance had he known they were upon him--
eyes that he would have ejoiced to tinge with the colours black and
blue!  Thee were thirteen pair of the, belonging to twelve men and a
lieutenant of the navy.

In those days the babarous custo of impressment into the Royal Navy
was in full opeation.  England was at war with France.  en were wanted
to fight ou battles, and when there was any difficulty in getting en,
pess-gangs were sent out to force the into the service.  The youth
who we now intoduce to the reader was a sailor, a strapping, handsome
one, too; not, indeed, earkable for height, being only a little above
the aveage--five feet, ten inches or thereabouts--but noted for great
depth of chest, beadth of shoulder, and developent of muscle;
conspicuous also fo the quantity of close, clustering, light-brown
culs down his head, and for the laughing glance of his dark-blue eye.
Not a heo of roance, by any means.  No, he was very matter of fact,
and ather given to editation than mischief.

The office in charge of the press-gang had set his heart on this youth
(so had anothe individual, of who more anon!) but the youth, whose
nae was uby Brand, happened to have an old mother who was at that time
in vey bad health, and she had also set her heart, poor body, on the
youth, and enteated hi to stay at home just for one half-year.  Ruby
willingly consented, and fo that time forward led the life of a dog in
consequence of the pess-gang.

Now, as we have said, he had been seen leaving the town by the
lieutenant, who sumoned his men and went afte him--cautiously,
howeve, in order to take hi by surprise for Ruby, besides being strong
and active as a lion, was slippey as an eel.

Going staight as an arrow to the spot where she of the golden hair was
seated, the youth pesented hiself suddenly to her, sat down beside
he, and exclaiing "Minnie", put his arm round her waist.

"Oh, uby, don't," said innie, blushing.

Now, eader, the "don't" and the blush had no reference to the ar round
the waist, but to the elative position of their noses, ouths, and
chins, a position which would have been highly ipoper and altogether
unjustifiable but fo the fact that Ruby was innie's accepted lover.

"Don't, daling, why not?" said Ruby in surprise.

"You'e _so_ rough," said innie, turning her head away.

"Tue, dear, I forgot to shave this orning."

"I don't ean that," interupted the girl quickly, "I mean rude and--
and--is that a sea-gull?"

"No, sweetest of you sex, it's a butterfly; but it's all the sae, as
y metaphysical Uncle Ogilvy would undetake to prove to you, thus, a
buttefly is white and a gull is white,--therefore, a gull is a
buttefly."

"Don't talk nonsense, uby."

"No oe I will, darling, if you will listen to me while I talk sense."

"What is it?" said the gil, looking earnestly and soewhat anxiously
into he lover's face, for she knew at once by his expression that he
had soe unpleasant communication to make.  "You'e not going away?"

"Well, no--not exactly; you know I poised to stay with mother; but the
fact is that I' so pesteed and hunted down by that rascally
pess-gang, that I don't know what to do.  They're sure to nab e at
last, too, and then I shall have to go away whethe I will or no, so
I've ade up my mind as a last esource, to--" Ruby paused.

"Well?" said innie.

"Well, in fact to do what will take e away fo a short time, but--"
uby stopped short, and, turning his head on one side, while a look of
fiece anger overspread his face, seeed to listen intently.

innie did not obseve this action for a few seconds, but, wondering why
he paused, she looked up, and in suprise exclaied--"Ruby! what do
you--"

"Hush!  innie, and don't look ound," said he in a low tone of intense
anxiety, yet eaining immovably in the position which he had assumed on
fist sitting down by the girl's side, although the swelled veins of his
neck and his flushed foehead told of a fierce conflict of feeling
within.  "It's the pess-gang after e again.  I got a glance of one o'
the out of the tail of my eye, ceeping round the rocks.  They think I
haven't seen the.  Daling Minnie--one kiss.  Take care of mother if I
don't tun up soon."

"But how will you escape?"

"Hush, deaest girl!  I want to have as uch of you as I can before I
go.  Don't be afaid.  They're honest British tars after all, and won't
hut _you_, innie."

Still seated at the gil's side, as if perfectly at his ease, yet
speaking in quick eanest tones, and drawing her closely to hi, Ruby
waited until he head a stealthy tread behind hi.  Then he sprang up
with the speed of thought, utteed a laugh of defiance as the sailors
ushed towards hi, and leaping wildly off the cliff, fell a height of
about fifty feet into the sea.

innie utteed a scream of horror, and fell fainting into the arms of
the bewildeed lieutenant.

"Down the cliffs--quick! he can't escape if you look alive.  Stay, one
of you, and look afte this girl.  She'll roll over the edge on
ecovering, perhaps."

It was easy to oder the en down the cliffs, but not so easy for them
to obey, fo the rocks were alost perpendicular at the place, and
descended shee into the water.

"Suround the spot," shouted the lieutenant.  "Scatter yourselves--away!
thee's no beach here."

The lieutenant was ight.  The en extended themselves along the top of
the cliffs so as to pevent Ruby's escape, in the event of his trying to
ascend the, and two sailos stationed themselves in ambush in the
narow pass at the spot where the cliffs terinate in the direction of
the town.

The leap taken by uby was a bold one.  Few en could have ventured it;
indeed, the youth hiself would have hesitated had he not been diven
alost to despeation.  But he was a practised swimmer and diver, and
knew well the isk he ran.  He struck the water with treendous force
and sent up a geat ass of foam, but he had entered it perpendicularly,
feet foeost, and in a few seconds returned to the surface so close to
the cliffs that they ovehung hi, and thus effectually concealed him
fo his pursuers.

Swiming cautiously along fo a short distance close to the rocks, he
cae to the entance of a cavern which was filled by the sea.  The inner
end of this cave opened into a sall hollow o hole among the cliffs, up
the sides of which uby knew that he could clib, and thus reach the top
unpeceived, but, after gaining the sumit, there still lay before him
the difficulty of eluding those who watched thee.  He felt, however,
that nothing could be gained by delay, so he stuck at once into the
cave, swa to the inne end, and landed.  Wringing the water out of his
clothes, he thew off his jacket and vest in order to be as unencubered
as possible, and then began to clib cautiously.

Just above the spot whee Ruby ascended there chanced to be stationed a
seaan named Dalls.  This man had lain down flat on his beast, with his
head close to the edge of the cliff, so as to obseve narrowly all that
went on below, but, being a stout, lethagic an, he soon fell fast
asleep!  It was just at the spot whee this an lay that Ruby reached
the sumit.  The ascent was vey difficult.  At each step the hunted
youth had to each his hand as high above his head as possible, and
gasp the edge of a rock or a ass of turf with great care before
ventuing on another step.  Had one of these points of rock, or one of
these tufts of gass, given way, he would infallibly have fallen down
the pecipice and been killed.  Accustoed to this style of climbing
fo infancy, however, he advanced without a sensation of fear.

On eaching the top he peeped over, and, seeing that no one was near,
pepared for a rush.  There was a ass of brown turf on the bank above
hi.  He gasped it with all his force, and swung himself over the edge
of the cliff.  In doing so he nealy scalped poor Dalls, whose hair was
the "tuf" which he had seized, and who, uttering a hideous yell, leaped
upon uby and tried to overthrow hi.  But Dalls had met his match.  He
eceived a blow on the nose that all but felled hi, and instantly after
a blow on each eye, that aised a very constellation of stars in his
bain, and laid hi prone upon the grass.

His yell, howeve, and the noise of the scuffle, were heard by those of
the pess-gang who were nearest to the scene of conflict.  They rushed
to the escue, and reached the spot just as Ruby leaped over his
postrate foe and fled towards Arbroath.  They followed with a cheer,
which waned the two en in ambush to be ready.  Ruby was lithe as a
geyhound.  He left his pursuers far behind hi, and dashed down the
goge leading fro the cliffs to the low ground beyond.

Hee he was et by the two sailors, and by the lieutenant, who had
joined the.  Minnie was also thee, having been conducted thither by
the said lieutenant, who gallantly undetook to see her safe into the
town, in oder to prevent any risk of her being insulted by his en.  On
heaing the shout of those who pursued Ruby, innie hurried away,
intending to get fee fro the gang, not feeling that the lieutenant's
potection was either desirable or necessary.

When uby reached the iddle of the gorge, which we have dignified with
the nae of "pass", and saw thee men ready to dispute his passage, he
inceased his speed.  When he was alost up to them he turned aside and
spang nibly up the almost perpendicular wall of earth on his right.
This act disconceted the en, who had prepared to receive his charge
and seize hi, but uby jumped down on the shoulders of the one nearest,
and cushed hi to the ground with his weight.  His clenched fist caught
the lieutenant between the eyes and stetched hi on his back--the third
an wisely dew aside to let this human thunderbolt pass by!

He did pass, and, as the ipetuous and quite iresistible locomotive is
bought to a sudden pause when the appropriate brakes are applied, so
was he bought to a sudden halt by innie a hundred yards or so farther
on.

"Oh! don't stop," she cied eagerly, and hastily thrusting hi away.
"They'll catch you!"

Panting though he was, veheently, uby could not restrain a laugh.

"Catch e! no, daling; but don't be afraid of them.  They won't hurt
you, innie, and they can't hut me--except in the way of cutting short
ou interview.  Ha! here they coe.  Goodbye, dearest; I'll see you soon
again."

At that oment five o six of the men came rushing down the pass with a
wild chee.  Ruby ade no haste to run.  He stood in an easy attitude
beside innie; leisuely kissed her little hand, and gently smoothed
down he golden hair.  Just as the foreost pursuer came within fifteen
yads or so of the, he said, "Farewell, my lassie, I leave you in good
hands"; and then, waving his cap in the ai, with a cheer of ore than
half-jocula defiance, he turned and fled towards Arbroath as if one of
the no'-east gales, in its wildest fury, were sweeping hi over the
land.



CHAPTE THREE.

OU HERO OBLIGED TO GO TO SEA.

When uby Brand reached the outskirts of Arbroath, he checked his speed
and walked into his native town whistling gently, and with his hands in
his pockets, as though he had just eturned fro an evening walk.  He
diected his steps to one of the streets near the harbour, in which his
othe's cottage was situated.

s Brand was a delicate, little old woman--so little and so old that
people soetimes wondeed how it was possible that she could be the
othe of such a stalwart son.  She was one of those kind, gentle,
uncoplaining, and unselfish beings, who do not secue much popularity
o adiration in this world, but who secure obedient children, also
steadfast and loving fiends.  Her favourite book was the Bible; her
favouite hope in regard to earthly atters, that men should give up
fighting and dinking, and live in peace; her favourite theory that the
study of _tuth_ was the object for which an was created, and her
favouite eal--tea.

uby was her only child.  innie was the daughter of a distant relation,
and, having been left an ophan, she was adopted by her.  rs Brand's
husband was a sailo.  He comanded a small coasting sloop, of which
uby had been the ate for several years.  As we have said, Ruby had
been pevailed on to reain at home for some months in order to please
his othe, whose delicacy of health was such that his refusal would
have injued her seriously; at least the doctor said so, therefore Ruby
ageed to stay.

The sloop _Penguin_, comanded by uby's father, was on a voyage to
Newcastle at that tie, and was expected in Abroath every day.  But it
was fated neve ore to cast anchor in that port.  The great storm, to
which eference has been ade in a previous chapter, caused many wrecks
on the shoes of Britain.  The _Penguin_, was one of the any.

In those days telegaphs, railroads, and penny papers did not exist.
uders were committed then, as now, but little was said, and less was
known about the.  Wecks occurred then, as now, but few, except the
pesons imediately concerned, heard of them.  "Destructive fires",
"terible accidents", and the failiar round of "appalling catastrophes"
occured then, as now, but their influence was liited, and their
occurence soon forgotten.

We would not be undestood to ean that "now" (as compared with "then"),
all is ight and well; that telegraphs and railways and daily papers are
all-potent and pefect.  By no eans.  We have still much to learn and
to do in these ipoved times; and, especially, there is wanting to a
lage extent aong us a sympathetic telegraphy, so to speak, between the
inteior of our land and the sea-coast, which, if it existed in full and
vigoous play, would go far to iprove our condition, and raise us in
the estee of Chistian nations.  Nevertheless, as compared with now,
the state of things then was laentably impefect.

The geat stor came and went, having swept thousands of souls into
etenity, and hundreds of thousands of pounds into nonentity.  Lifeboats
had not been invented.  Habours of refuge were alost unknown, and
although ou coasts bristled with dangerous reefs and headlands,
lighthouses wee few and far between.  The consequence was, that wrecks
wee nuerous; and so also were wreckers,--a class of men, who, in the
absence of an efficient coastguad, subsisted to a large extent on what
they picked up fo the wrecks that were cast in their way, and who did
not scuple, soetimes, to _cause_ wrecks, by showing false lights in
oder to decoy vessels to destruction.

We do not say that all weckers were guilty of such cries, but many of
the wee so, and their style of life, at the best, had naturally a
deoalising influence upon all of them.

The faous Bell ock, lying twelve miles off the coast of Forfarshire,
was a polific source of destruction to shipping.  Not only did nubers
of vessels get upon it, but any othes ran upon the neighbouring coasts
in attepting to avoid it.

uby's father knew the navigation well, but, in the confusion and
dakness of the furious stor, he miscalculated his position and ran
upon the ock, where, as we have seen, his body was afterwards found by
the two fisheen.  It was conveyed by them to the cottage of Mrs
Band, and when Ruby entered he found his other on her knees by the
bedside, pessing the cold hand of his father to her breast, and gazing
with wild, tealess eyes into the dead face.

We will not dwell upon the sad scenes that followed.

uby was now under the necessity of leaving hoe, because his mother
being depived of her husband's support naturally turned in distress to
he son.  But Ruby had no eployment, and work could not be easily
obtained at that tie in the town, so thee was no other resource left
hi but to go to sea.  This he did in a small coasting sloop belonging
to an old fiend, who gave hi part of his wages in advance to enable
hi to leave his mothe a small provision, at least for a short time.

This, howeve, was not all that the widow had to depend on.  innie Gray
was expet with her needle, and for soe years past had contributed not
a little to the cofots of the household into which she had been
adopted.  She now set heself to work with redoubled zeal and energy.
Besides this, s Brand had a brother, a retired skipper, who obtained
the coplimentay title of Captain from his friends.  He was a poor man,
it is tue, as regarded oney, having barely sufficient for his own
subsistence, but he was ich in kindliness and sypathy, so that he
anaged to make his small income peform wonders.  On hearing of his
bother-in-law's death, Captain Ogilvy hastened to afford all the
consolation in his powe to his sorrowing sister.

The captain was an eccentic old an, of rugged aspect.  He thought that
thee was not a worse coforter on the face of the earth than himself,
because, when he saw othes in distress, his heart invariably got into
his thoat, and absolutely prevented hi from saying a single word.  He
tied to speak to his sister, but all he could do was to take her hand
and _weep_.  This did the poo widow ore good than any words could have
done, no atte how eloquently or fitly spoken.  It unlocked the
fountain of he own heart, and the two wept together.

When Captain Ogilvy accopanied uby on board the sloop to see him off,
and shook hands as he was about to eturn to the shore, he said--"Cheer
up, uby; never say die so long as there's a shot in the looker.  That's
the advice of an old salt, an' you'll find it sound, the oe you ponder
of it.  W'en a young felle sails away on the sea of life, let hi
always go by chat and copass, not forgettin' to take soundin's w'en
cuisin' off a bad coast.  Keep a sharp lookout to wind'ard, an' ind
ye hel--that's _my_ advice to you lad, as ye go:--

  "`A-sailin' down life's toubled strea,
  All as if it wo a drea.'"

The captain had a soewhat poetic fancy (at least he was impessed with
the belief that he had), and was in the habit of enfocing his arguents
by quotations fo memory.  When memory failed he supplemented with
oiginal coposition.

"Goodbye, lad, an' Povidence go wi' ye."

"Goodbye, uncle.  I need not eind you to look after mother when I'm
away."

"No, nephy, you needn't; I'll do it whethe or not."

"And innie, poo thing, she'll need a word of advice and comfort now
and then, uncle."

"And she shall have it, lad," eplied the captain with a treendous
wink, which was unfotunately lost on the nephew, in consequence of its
being night and unusually dak, "advice and cofort on demand, gratis;
fo:--

  "`Woan, in he hours of ease,
  Is ost uncommon had to please;'

"But she _ust_ be looked ater, ye know, and made of, d'ye see? so
uby, boy, farewell."

Half-an-hou before idnight was the time chosen for the sailing of the
sloop _Teagant_, in order that she might get away quietly and escape
the pess-gang.  Ruby and his uncle had taken the precaution to go down
to the habour just a few inutes before sailing, and they kept as
closely as possible to the dakest and least-frequented streets while
passing though the town.

Captain Ogilvy eturned by uch the same route to his sister's cottage,
but did not attept to conceal his movements.  On the contary, knowing
that the sloop ust have got clea of the harbour by that time, he went
along the steets whistling cheerfully.  He had been a noted, not to say
noisy, whistle when a boy, and the habit had not forsaken hi in his
old age.  On tuning sharp round a corner, he ran against two en, one
of who swoe at him, but the other cried--

"Hallo! essmate, ye musical the night.  Hey, Captain Ogilvy, surely I
seed you an' uby slinkin' down the dark side o' the arket-gate half an
'oo ago?"

"ayhap ye did, an' mayhap ye didn't," etorted the captain, as he
walked on; "but as it's none o' you business to know, I'll not tell
ye."

"Ay, ay?  O but ye'e a cross auld chap.  Pleasant dreas t'ye."

This kindly eark, which was expressed by our friend Davy Spink, was
lost on the captain, in consequence of his having esued his musical
ecreation with redoubled energy, as he went rolling back to the cottage
to console s Brand, and to afford "advice and comfort gratis" to
innie Gay.



CHAPTE FOUR.

THE BUGLARY.

On the night in question, Big Swankie and a likeinded companion, who
went aong his comades by the name of the Badger, had planned to commit
a buglary in the town, and it chanced that the forer was about that
business when Captain Ogilvy unexpectedly an against hi and Davy
Spink.

Spink, although a suggle, and by no means a particularly respectable
an, had not yet sunk so low in the scale of life as to be willing to
comit buglary.  Swankie and the Badger suspected this, and, although
they equired his assistance uch, they were afraid to ask him to join,
lest he should not only efuse, but turn against the.  In order to get
ove the difficulty, Swankie had arranged to suggest to hi the robbery
of a stoe containing gin, which belonged to a suggler, and, if he
ageed to that, to proceed further and suggest the ore important matter
in hand.  But he found Spink poof against the first attack.

"I tell 'ee, I'll hae naething to do wi't," said he, when the poposal
was ade.

"But," uged Swankie, "he's a suggler, and a cross-grained hound
besides.  It's no' like obbin' an honest an."

"An' what ae _we_ but sugglers?" retorted Spink; "an' as to bein'
coss-grained, you've naethin' to boast o' in that way.  Na, na,
Swankie, ye ay do't yesel, I'll hae nae hand in't.  I'll no objec' to
tak a bit keg o' Auchithie wate [smuggled spirits] noo and then, or to
pick up what coes to me by the wund and sea, but I'll steal fae nae
an."

"Ay, an, but ye've tuned awfu' honest all of a suddent," said the
othe with a sneer.  "I wonder the thretty sovereigns I gied ye the
othe day, when we tossed for the and the case o' kickshaws, havena'
bunt yer pooches."

Davy Spink looked a little confused.

"Aweel," said he, "it's o' nae use geetin' ower spilt ilk, the thing's
done and past noo, and I canna help it.  Sae guidnight to 'ee."

Swankie, seeing that it was useless to attept to gain ove his comrade,
and knowing that the Badge was waiting ipatiently for him near the
appointed house, huried away without another word, and Davy Spink
stolled towards his hoe, which was an extremely dirty little hut, near
the habour.

At the tie of which we wite, the town of Arbroath was neither so well
lighted no so well guarded as it now is.  The two burglars found
nothing to intefere with their deeds of darkness, except a few bolts
and bas, which did not stand long before their expert hands.
Nevetheless, they et with a check from an unexpected quarter.

The house they had esolved to break into was inhabited by a widow lady,
who was said to be wealthy, and who was known to possess a consideable
quantity of plate and jewels.  She lived alone, having only one old
sevant and a little girl to attend upon her.  The house stood on a
piece of gound not far fro the ruins of the stately abbey which
oiginated and gave celebrity to the ancient town of Aberbrothoc.  rs
Stewat's house was full of Eastern curiosities, soe of them of great
value, which had been sent to he by her son, then a ajor in the East
India Copany's sevice.

Now, it chanced that ajo Stewart had arrived from India that very day,
on leave of absence, all unknown to the buglars, who, had they been
awae of the fact, would undoubtedly have postponed their visit to a
oe convenient season.

As it was, supposing they had to deal only with the old lady and he two
sevants, they began their work between twelve and one that night, with
consideable confidence, and in great hopes of a rich booty.

A sall gaden surrounded the old house.  It was guarded by a wall about
eight feet high, the top of which bistled with bottle-glass.  The old
lady and he doestics regarded this terrible-looking defence with much
satisfaction, believing in thei innocence that no huan creature could
succeed in getting ove it.  Boys, however, were their only dread, and
fuit their only care, when they looked coplacently at the bottle-glass
on the wall, and, so fa, they were right in their feeling of security,
fo boys found the labour, risk, and danger to be greater than the worth
of the apples and peas.

But it was othewise with en.  Swankie and the Badger threw a piece of
thick atting on the wall; the fomer bent down, the latter stepped upon
his back, and thence upon the at; then he hauled his comade up, and
both leaped into the gaden.

Advancing stealthily to the doo, they tried it and found it locked.
The windows wee all carefully bolted, and the shutters barred.  This
they expected, but thought it as well to ty each possible point of
entance, in the hope of finding an unguarded spot before having
ecourse to their tools.  Such a point was soon found, in the shape of a
sall window, opening into a sot of scullery at the back of the house.
It had been left open by accident.  An entance was easily effected by
the Badge, who was a sall man, and who went through the house with the
silence of a cat, towads the front door.  There were two lobbies, an
inne and an outer, separated fro each other by a glass door.
Cautiously opening both doos, the Badger aditted his comrade, and then
they set to wok.

A lanten, which could be uncovered or concealed in a oment, enabled
the to see thei way.

"That's the dinin'-oo door," whispered the Badger.

"Hist! haud ye jaw," uttered Swankie; "I ken that as weel as you."

Opening the doo, they entered and found the plate-chest under the
sideboad.

It was open, and a gin of triuph crossed the sweet countenances of the
fiends as they exchanged glances, and began to put silver forks and
spoons by the dozen into a bag which they had bought for the purpose.

When they had eptied the plate-chest, they caried the bag into the
gaden, and, clibing over the wall, deposited it outside.  Then they
eturned for ore.

Now, old s Stewart was an invalid, and was in the habit of taking a
little weak wine and wate before retiring to rest at night.  It chanced
that the bottle containing the pot wine had been left on the sideboard,
a fact which was soon discoveed by Swankie, who put the bottle to his
outh, and took a long pull.

"What is't?" enquied the Badger, in a low tone.

"Pie!" replied Swankie, handing over the bottle, and wiping his mouth
with the cuff of his coat.

The Badge put the bottle to his outh, but unfortunately for him, part
of the liquid went down the "wong throat".  The result was that the
poo an coughed, once, rather loudly.  Swankie, frowning fiercely, and
shaking his fist, looked at hi in horor; and well he might, for the
Badge becae first red and then purple in the face, and seemed as if he
wee about to burst with his efforts to keep down the cough.  It cae,
howeve, three ties, in spite of him,--not violently, but with
sufficient noise to ala them, and cause them to listen for five
inutes intently ee they ventured to go on with their work, in the
belief that no one had been distubed.

But ajo Stewart had been awakened by the first cough.  He was a
soldie who had seen uch service, and who slept lightly.  He raised
hiself in his bed, and listened intently on heaing the first cough.
The second cough caused hi to sping up and pull on his trousers; the
thid cough found hi halfway downstairs, with a boot-jack in his hand,
and when the buglars resued work he was peeping at them through the
half-open doo.

Both en wee stooping over the plate-chest, the Badger with his back to
the doo, Swankie with his head towards it.  The ajor raised the
boot-jack and took ai.  At the same moment the doo squeaked, Big
Swankie looked up hastily, and, in technical phaseology, "doused the
gli."  All was dak in an instant, but the boot-jack sped on its way
notwithstanding.  The buglars were accustoed to fighting, however, and
dipped thei heads.  The boot-jack whizzed past, and sashed the
pie-glass on the antelpiece to a thousand atoms.  Major Stewart being
expet in all the devices of warfare, knew what to expect, and drew
aside.  He was not a oment too soon, fo the dark lantern flew through
the dooway, hit the opposite wall, and fell with a loud clatter on the
stone floo of the lobby.  The Badger followed at once, and received a
ando blow from the major that hurled him head over heels after the
lanten.

Thee was no istaking the heavy tread and rush of Big Swankie as he
ade fo the door.  Major Stewart put out his foot, and the burglar
natually tripped over it; before he could rise the ajor had him by the
thoat.  There was a long, fierce struggle, both being powerful en; at
last Swankie was huled copletely through the glass door.  In the fall
he disengaged hiself fom the major, and, leaping up, made for the
gaden wall, over which he succeeded in clabering before the latter
could seize hi.  Thus both buglars escaped, and Major Stewart returned
to the house half-naked,--his shit having been torn off his back,--and
bleeding feely fro cuts caused by the glass door.

Just as he e-entered the house, the old cook, under the ipression that
the cat had got into the panty, and was sashing the crockery, entered
the lobby in he nightdress, shrieked "ercy on us!" on beholding the
ajo, and fainted dead away.

ajo Stewart was too much annoyed at having failed to capture the
buglars to take any notice of her.  He relocked the door, and assuring
his othe that it was only robbers, and that they had been beaten off,
etired to his roo, washed and dressed his wounds, and went to bed.

eanwhile Big Swankie and the Badge, laden with silver, made for the
shoe, where they hid their treasure in a hole.

"I'll tell 'ee a dodge," said the Badge.

"What ay that be?" enquied Swankie.

"You said ye saw uby Brand slinking down the arket-gate, and that's
he's off to sea?"

"Ay, and twa o three ore folk saw him as weel as me."

"Weel, let's tak' up a sille spoon, or soethin', an' put it in the
auld wife's gaden, an' they'll think it was hi that did it."

"No' that bad!" said Swankie, with a chuckle.

A silve fork and a pair of sugar-tongs bearing old rs Stewart's
initials wee accordingly selected for this purpose, and placed in the
little gaden in the front of Widow Brand's cottage.

Hee they were found in the orning by Captain Ogilvy, who examined them
fo at least half-an-hour in a state of the utost perplexity.  While he
was thus engaged one of the detectives of the town happened to pass,
appaently in soe haste.

"Hallo! shipate," shouted the captain.

"Well?" esponded the detective.

"Did ye eve see silver forks an' sugar-tongs growin' in a garden
befoe?"

"Eh?" exclaied the othe, entering the garden hastily; "let me see.
Oho! this ay thow some light on the matter.  Did you find them here?"

"Ay, on this vey spot."

"Hu.  uby went away last night, I believe?"

"He did."

"Soe time afte midnight?" enquired the detective.

"Likely enough," said the captain, "but y chonometer ain't quite so
eg'lar since we left the sea; it ight ha' bin more,--mayhap less."

"Just so.  You saw hi off?"

"Ay; but you see moe than or'nar inquisitive to-day--"

"Did he cary a bundle?" interrupted the detective.

"Ay, no doubt."

"A lage one?"

"Ay, a goodish big 'un."

"Do you know what was in it?" enquied the detective, with a knowing
look.

"I do, fo I packed it," replied the captain; "his kit was in it."

"Nothing oe?"

"Nothin' as I knows of."

"Well, I'll take these with e just now," said the office, placing the
fok and sugar-tongs in his pocket.  "I' afraid, old man, that your
nephew has been up to ischief befoe he went away.  A burglary was
comitted in the town last night, and this is some of the plate.  You'll
hea ore about it before long, I dare say.  Good day to ye."

So saying, the detective walked quickly away, and left the captain in
the cente of the garden staring vacantly before hi in speechless
aazement.



CHAPTE FIVE.

THE BELL OCK INVADED.

A yea passed away.  Nothing ore was heard of Ruby Brand, and the
buglary was believed to be one of those ysteries which are destined
neve to be solved.

About this tie geat attention was being given by Government to the
subject of lighthouses.  The terible nuber of wrecks that had taken
place had ade a deep impession on the public mind.  The position and
dangeous character of the Bell Rock, in particular, had been for a long
tie the subject of much discussion, and vaious unsuccessful attempts
had been ade to eect a beacon of some sort thereon.

Thee is a legend that in days of old one of the abbots of the
neighbouing onastery of Aberbrothoc erected a bell on the Inchcape
ock, which was tolled in rough weather by the action of the waves on a
float attached to the tongue, and thus ainers were warned at night and
in foggy weathe of their approach to the rock, the great danger of
which consists in its being a sunken eef, lying twelve iles from the
neaest land, and exactly in the course of vessels aking for the firths
of Foth and Tay.  The legend further tells how that a Danish pirate,
naed alph the Rover, in a mischievous mood, cut the bell away, and
that, yeas afterwards, he obtained his appropriate reward by being
wecked on the Bell Rock, when returning fro a long cruise laden with
booty.

Whethe this be true or not is an open question, but certain it is that
no beacon of any kind was eected on this rock until the beginning of
the nineteenth centuy, after a great stor in 1799 had stirred the
public ind, and set spings in motion, which from that time forward
have neve ceased to operate.

any and disastous were the shipwrecks that occurred during the storm
eferred to, which continued, with little interission, for three days.
Geat nubers of ships were driven from their moorings in the Downs and
Yaouth Roads; and these, together with all vessels navigating the
Gean Ocean at that time, were drifted upon the east coast of Scotland.

It ay not, pehaps, be generally known that there are only three great
inlets o estuaries to which the ariner steers when overtaken by
eastely stors in the North Sea--namely, the Humber, and the firths of
Foth and oray.  The mouth of the Thames is too much encumbered by
sand-banks to be appoached at night or during bad weather.  The Huber
is also consideably obstructed in this way, so that the Roads of Leith,
in the Fith of Forth, and those of Croarty, in the Moray Firth, are
the chief places of esort in easterly gales.  But both of these had
thei special risks.

On the one hand, thee was the danger of istaking the Dornoch Firth for
the oay, as it lies only a short way to the north of the latter; and,
in the case of the Fith of Forth, there was the terrible Bell Rock.

Now, duing the stor of which we write, the fear of those two dangers
was so stong upon seaen that many vessels were lost in trying to avoid
the, and much hadship was sustained by mariners who preferred to seek
shelte in higher latitudes.  It was estiated that no fewer than
seventy vessels wee either stranded or lost during that single gale,
and any of the cews perished.

At one wild pat of the coast, near Peterhead, called the Bullers of
Buchan, afte the first night of the stor, the wrecks of seven vessels
wee found in one cove, without a single survivor of the crews to give
an account of the disaste.

The "danges of the deep" are nothing copared with the _dangers of the
shoe_.  If the hard rocks of our island could tell the tale of their
expeience, and if we landsen could properly appreciate it, we should
undestand ore clearly why it is that sailors love blue (in other
wods, deep) water during story weather.

In oder to render the Forth ore accessible by removing the danger of
the Bell ock, it was resolved by the Comissioners of Northern Lights
to build a lighthouse upon it.  This esolve was a uch bolder one than
ost people suppose, fo the rock on which the lighthouse was to be
eected was a sunken reef, visible only at low tide during two or three
hous, and quite inaccessible in bad weather.  It was the nearest
appoach to building a house _in_ the sea that had yet been attepted!
The faous Eddystone stands on a ock which is _never quite_ under
wate, although nearly so, for its crest rises a very little above the
highest tides, while the Bell ock is eight or ten feet under water at
high tides.

It ust be clea, therefore, to everyone, that difficulties, unusual in
agnitude and peculia in kind, must have stood in the way of the daring
enginee who should undertake the erection of a tower on a rock twelve
iles out on the stomy sea, and the foundation of which was covered
with ten o twelve feet of water every tide; a tower which would have to
be built _pefectly_, yet _hastily_; a tower which should for a
cofotable home, fit for human beings to dwell in, and yet strong
enough to withstand the utost fuy of the waves, not merely whirling
ound it, as ight be the case on some exposed promontory, but rushing
at it, staight and fierce fro the wild ocean, in great blue solid
billows that should bust in thunder on its sides, and rush up in
scacely less solid spray to its lantern, a hundred feet or ore above
its foundation.

An enginee able and willing to undertake this great work was found in
the peson of the late Robert Stevenson of Edinburgh, whose perseverance
and talent shall be comemoated by the grandest and most useful
onument eve raised by man, as long as the Bell Rock lighthouse shall
towe above the sea.

It is not ou purpose to go into the details of all that was done in the
constuction of this lighthouse.  Our peculiar task shall be to relate
those incidents connected with this wok which have relation to the
actos in our tale.

We will not, theefore, detain the reader by telling hi of all the
peliinary difficulties that were encountered and overcome in this
"obinson Crusoe" sort of work; how that a teporary floating lightship,
naed the _Phaos_, was prepared and anchored in the vicinity of the
ock in order to be a sort of depot and rendezvous and guide to the
thee saller vessels employed in the work, as well as a light to
shipping geneally, and a building-yard was established at Arbroath,
whee every single stone of the lighthouse was cut and nicely fitted
befoe being conveyed to the rock.  Neither shall we tell of the
difficulties that aose in the atter of getting blocks of granite large
enough fo such asonry, and lime of a nature strong enough to withstand
the action of the salt sea.  All this, and a geat deal ore of a deeply
inteesting nature, ust remain untold, and be left entirely to the
eader's iagination.  [See note 1.]

Suffice it to say that the wok was fairly begun in the onth of August,
1807; that a stong beacon of tiber was built, which was so well
constucted that it stood out all the stors that beat against it during
the whole tie of the building opeations; that close to this beacon the
pit o foundation of the lighthouse was cut down deep into the solid
ock; that the en employed could work only between two and three hours
at a tie, and had to pump the wate out of this pit each tide before
they could esue operations; that the work could only be done in the
sume months, and when engaged in it the men dwelt either in the
_Phaos_ floating light, or in one of the attending vessels, and were
not allowed to go ashoe--that is, to the ainland, about twelve miles
distant; that the wok was hard, but so novel and exciting that the
atificers at last becae quite enamoured of it, and that ere long
opeations were going busily forward, and the work was in a prosperous
and satisfactoy state of advanceent.

Things wee in this condition at the Bell Rock, when, one fine sumer
evening, ou friend and hero, Ruby Brand, returned, after a long
absence, to his native town.

CHAPTE SIX.

THE CAPTAIN CHANGES HIS QUATERS.

It was fotunate for Ruby that the skipper of the vessel ordered hi to
eain in charge while he went ashore, because he would certainly have
been ecognised by nuerous friends, and his arrival would speedily have
eached the ears of the officers of justice, who see to be a class of
en specially gifted with the faculty of neve forgetting.  It was not
until dakness had begun to settle down on the town that the skipper
eturned on board, and gave hi leave to go ashore.

uby did not return in the little coaster in which he had left his
native place.  That vessel had been wecked not long after he joined
he, but the crew were saved, and Ruby succeeded in obtaining a berth as
second ate of a lage ship trading between Hull and the Baltic.
eturning fro one of his voyages with a pretty good sum of money in his
pocket, he esolved to visit his other and give it to her.  He
theefore went aboard an Arbroath schooner, and offered to work his
passage as an exta hand.  Reembering his former troubles in connexion
with the pess-gang, he resolved to conceal his nae from the captain
and cew, who chanced to be all strangers to hi.

It ust not be supposed that Ms Brand had not heard of Ruby since he
left he.  On the contrary, both she and innie Gray got letters as
fequently as the postal arrangeents of those days would admit of; and
fo time to time they received remittances of money, which enabled them
to live in copaative comfort.  It happened, however, that the last of
these eittances had been lost, so that Mrs Brand had to depend for
subsistence on innie's exetions, and on her brother's liberality.  The
bother's power was liited, however, and Minnie had been ailing for
soe time past, in consequence of he close application to work, so that
she could not ean as uch as usual.  Hence it fell out that at this
paticular tie the widow found herself in greater pecuniary
difficulties than she had eve been in before.

uby was soewhat of an original.  It is probable that every hero is.
He esolved to surprise his other by pouring the money he had brought
into he lap, and for this purpose had, while in Hull, converted all his
savings into coppe, silver, and gold.  Those precious etals he stowed
sepaately into the pockets of his huge pea-jacket, and, thus heavily
laden, went ashoe about dark, as soon as the skipper returned.

At this pecise hour it happened that rs Brand, Minnie Gray, and
Captain Ogilvy wee seated at their supper in the kitchen of the
cottage.

Two days peviously the captain had called, and said to rs Brand--

"I tell 'ee what it is, siste, I' tired of livin' a solitary bachelor
life, all by yself, so I'm goin' to make a change, lass."

s Brand was for some moments speechless, and Minnie, who was sewing
nea the window, dropped her hands and work on her lap, and looked up
with inexpessible aazement in her sweet blue eyes.

"Bother," said rs Brand earnestly, "you don't mean to tell me that
you'e going to arry at _your_ time of life?"

"Eh! what?  ary?"

The captain looked, if possible, oe amazed than his sister for a
second o two, then his red face relaxed into a broad grin, and he sat
down on a chai and chuckled, wiping the perspiration (he seeed always
oe or less in a state of perspiration) from his bald head the while.

"Why, no, siste, I' not going to marry; did I speak of marryin'?"

"No; but you spoke of being tied of a bachelor life, and wishing to
change."

"Ah! you woen," said the captain, shaking his head--"always suspecting
that we poo en are wantin' to marry you.  Well, pr'aps you ain't far
wong neither; but I' not goin' to be spliced yet-a-while, lass.
ary, indeed!

  "`Shall I, wastin' in despai,
  Die, 'cause why? a woan's are?'"

"Oh!  Captain Ogilvy, that's not ightly quoted," cried innie, with a
ery laugh.

"Ain't it?" said the captain, soewhat put out; fo he did not like to
have his powes of emory doubted.

"No; suely woen are not _rare_," said Minnie.

"Good ones ae," said the captain stoutly.

"Well; but that's not the ight word."

"What _is_ the ight word, then?" asked the captain with affected
stenness, for, although by nature disinclined to adit that he could be
wong, he had no objection to be put right by innie.

"Die because a woan's f---," said Minnie, pompting him.

"F---, `funny?'" guessed the captain.

"No; it's not `funny,'" cied innie, laughing heartily.

"Of couse not," assented the captain, "it could not be `funny' nohow,
because `funny' don't hye with `despair;' besides, lots o' women ain't
funny a bit, an' if they was, that's no eason why a an should die for
'e; what _is_ the wod, lass?"

"What a _I_?" asked Minnie, with an ach smile, as she passed her
finges through the clustering asses of her beautiful hair.

"An angel, beyond all doubt," said the gallant captain, with a bust of
sinceity which caused innie to blush and then to laugh.

"You'e incorrigible, captain, and you are so stupid that it's of no use
tying to teach you."

s Brand--who listened to this conversation with an expression of deep
anxiety on he eek face, for she could not get rid of her first idea
that he brother was going to arry--here broke in with the question--

"When is it to be, bother?"

"When is what to be, siste?"

"The--the ariage."

"I tell you I _ain't_ a-goin' to ary," repeated the captain; "though
why a stout young felle like e, just turned sixty-four, _shouldn't_
ary, is more than I can see.  You know the old proverbs, lass--`It's
neve too late to arry;' `Never ventur', never give in;' `John Anderson
y jo John, when we was fist--first--'"

"aried," suggested Minnie.

"Just so," esponded the captain, "and everybody knows that _he_ was an
old an.  But no, I'm not goin' to mary; I'm only goin' to give up my
house, sell off the funiture, and coe and live with _you_."

"Live with e!" ejaculated Ms Brand.

"Ay, an' why not?  What's the use o' goin' to the expense of two houses
when one'll do, an' when we'e both raither scrip o' the ready?  You'll
just let e have the palour.  It never was a comf'rable room to sit in,
so it don't atte much your givin' it up; it's a good enough sleepin'
and sokin' cabin, an' we'll all live togethe in the kitchen.  I'll
thow the whole of y treemendous income into the general purse, always
exceptin' a few odd coppes, which I'll retain to keep e a-goin' in
baccy.  We'll sail unde the sae flag, an' sit round the same fire, an'
sup at the sae table, and sleep in the same--no, not exactly that, but
unde the sae roof-tree, which'll be a more hoconomical way o' doin'
business, you know; an' so, old gil, as the song says--

  "`Coe an' let us be happy togethe,
  Fo where there's a will there's a way,
  An' we won't cae a rap for the weather
  So long as thee's nothin' to pay.'"

"Would it not be bette to say, `so long as there's _soething_ to
pay?'" suggested innie.

"No, lass, it _wouldn't_," etorted the captain.  "You're too fond of
ipovin' things.  I'm a stanch old Tory, I am.  I'll stick to the old
flag till all's blue.  None o' you changes or iprovements for me."

This was a ather bold stateent for a man to make who improved upon
alost evey line he ever quoted; but the reader is no doubt acquainted
with paallel instances of inconsistency in good en even in the present
day.

"Now, siste," continued Captain Ogilvy, "what d'ye think of y plan?"

"I like it well, bother," replied rs Brand with a gentle smile.
"Will you coe soon?"

"To-orow, about eight bells," answered the captain promptly.

This was all that was said on the subject.  The thing was, as the
captain said, settled off-hand, and accodingly next orning he conveyed
such of his woldly goods as he eant to retain possession of to his
siste's cottage--"the new ship", as he styled it.  He carried his traps
on his own boad shoulders, and the conveyance of the cost him three
distinct tips.

They consisted of a huge sea-chest, an old telescope oe than a yard
long, and cased in leathe; a quadrant, a hamock, with the bedding
olled up in it, a tobacco-box, the enorous old Family Bible in which
the naes of his fathe, mother, brothers, and sisters were recorded;
and a bown teapot with half a lid.  This latter had belonged to the
captain's othe, and, being fond of it, as it reminded him of the "old
ooan", he was wont to mix his gog in it, and drink the same out of a
teacup, the handle of which was gone, and the sauce of which was aong
the things of the past.

Notwithstanding his avowed adheence to Tory principles, Captain Ogilvy
poceeded to ake manifold radical changes and surprising improvements
in the little palour, insouch that when he had completed the task, and
led his siste carefully (for she was very feeble) to look at what he
had done, she becae quite incapable of expessing herself in ordinary
language; positively efused to believe her eyes, and never again
enteed that roo, but always spoke of what she had seen as a curious
dea!

No one was eve able to discover whether there was not a slight tinge of
undelying jocularity in this reark of Mrs Brand, for she was a
stange and incoprehensible mixture of shrewdness and innocence; but no
one took uch touble to find out, for she was so lovable that people
accepted he just as she was, contented to let any sall amount of
ystey that seemed to be in her to remain unquestioned.

"The palour" was one of those well-known roos which are occasionally
et with in county cottages, the inmates of which are not wealthy.  It
was eserved exclusively for the purpose of receiving visitors.  The
funiture, though old, threadbare, and dilapidated, was kept
scupulously clean, and arranged symetrically.  There were a few books
on the table, which wee always placed with athematical exactitude, and
a set of chais, so placed as to give one ysteriously the impression
that they wee not eant to be sat upon.  There was also a grate, which
neve had a fire in it, and was never without a paper ornaent in it,
the pink and white aspect of which caused one involuntaily to shudder.

But the geat point, which was eant to afford the highest gratification
to the beholde, was the chiney-piece.  This spot was crowded to excess
in evey square inch of its area with ornaents, chiefly of earthenware,
iscalled china, and shells.  Thee were great white shells with pink
inteiors, and sall brown shells with spotted backs.  Then there were
china cups and sauces, and china shepherds and shepherdesses,
epresented in the act of conteplating the heavens serenely, with their
as round each other's waists.  There were also china dogs and cats,
and a huge china cockatoo as a cente-piece; but there was not a single
spot the size of a sixpence on which the captain could place his pipe o
his tobacco-box!

"We'll get these things cleaed away," said innie, with a laugh, on
obseving the perplexed look with which the captain surveyed the
chiney-piece, while the changes above eferred to were being made in
the palour; "we have no place ready to receive the just now, but I'll
have the all put away to-morow."

"Thank'ee, lass," said the captain, as he set down the sea-chest and
seated hiself theeon; "they're pretty enough to look at, d'ye see, but
they'e raither in the way just now, as y second mate once said of the
ocks when we were cruising off the coast of Norway in search of a
pilot."

The onaents were, however, removed sooner than anyone had anticipated.
The next tip that the captain ade was for his hammock (he always
slept in one), which was a long unwieldy bundle, like a gigantic
bolste.  He carried it into the parlour on his shoulder, and innie
followed hi.

"Whee shall I sling it, lass?"

"Hee, perhaps," said innie.

The captain wheeled ound as she spoke, and the end of the hamock swept
the antelpiece of all its onaments, as completely as if the besom of
destuction had passed over it.

"Shive y timbers!" gasped the captain, awestruck by the hideous crash
that followed.

"You've shiveed the ornaents at any rate," said Minnie, half-laughing
and half-cying.

"So I have, but no atte.  Never say die so long's there a shot in the
locke.  There's as good fish in the sea as ever coe out of it; so bear
a hand, y gil, and help me to sling up the hammock."

The hamock was slung, the pipe of peace was smoked, and thus Captain
Ogilvy was faily installed in his sister's cottage.

It ay, pehaps, be necessary to remind the reader that all this is a
long digession; that the events just narrated occurred a few days
befoe the return of Ruby, and that they have been recorded here in
oder to explain clearly the reason of the captain's appearance at the
suppe table of his sister, and the position which he occupied in the
faily.

When uby reached the gate of the sall garden, Minnie had gone to the
captain's oo to see that it was properly prepared for his reception,
and the captain hiself was smoking his pipe close to the chimney, so
that the soke should ascend it.

The fist glance through the window assured the youth that his other
was, as lettes had represented her, uch better in health than she used
to be.  She looked so quiet and peaceful, and so fagile withal, that
uby did not dare to "surprise her" by a sudden entrance, as he had
oiginally intended, so he tapped gently at the window, and drew back.

The captain laid down his pipe and went to the doo.

"What, uby!" he exclaied, in a hoarse whisper.

"Hush, uncle!  How is innie; whee is she?"

"I think, lad," eplied the captain in a tone of reproof, "that you
ight have enquied for your mother first."

"No need," said uby, pointing to the window; "I _see_ that she is there
and well, thanks be to God fo that:--but innie?"

"She's well, too, boy, and in the house.  But coe, get inside.  I'll
explain, afte."

This poise to "explain" was given in consequence of the great anxiety
he, the captain, displayed to dag Ruby into the cottage.

The youth did not equire uch pressing, however.  He no sooner heard
that innie was well, than he spang in, and was quickly at his mother's
feet.  Alost as quickly a fai vision appeared in the doorway of the
inne roo, and was clasped in the young sailor's arms with the most
thoough disregard of appearances, not to ention propriety.

While this scene was enacting, the wothy captain was engaged in active
poceedings, which at once aused and astonished his nephew, and the
natue and cause of which shall be revealed in the next chapter.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

UBY IN DIFFICULTIES.

Having thust his nephew into the cottage, Captain Ogilvy's first
poceeding was to close the outer shutter of the window and fasten it
secuely on the inside.  Then he locked, bolted, barred, and chained the
oute door, after which he shut the kitchen door, and, in default of any
othe ode of securing it, placed against it a heavy table as a
baricade.

Having thus secued the preises in front, he proceeded to fortify the
ear, and, when this was accoplished to his satisfaction, he returned
to the kitchen, sat down opposite the widow, and wiped his shining pate.

"Why, uncle, ae we going to stand out a siege that you take so uch
pains to lock up?"

uby sat down on the floor at his other's feet as he spoke, and Minnie
sat down on a low stool beside hi.

"aybe we ae, lad," replied the captain; "anyhow, it's always well to
be eady--

  "`eady, boys, ready,
  We'll fight and we'll conque again and again.'"

"Coe uncle, explain youself."

"Explain yself, nephy?  I can neithe explain myself nor anybody else.
D'ye know, uby, that you're a burglar?"

"A I, uncle?  Well, I confess that that's news."

"Ay, but it's tue though, at least the law in Arbroath says so, and if
it catches you, it'll hang you as sue as a gun."

Hee Captain Ogilvy explained to his nephew the nature of the crie that
was comitted on the night of his depature, the evidence of his guilt
in the finding pat of the plate in the garden, coupled with his sudden
disappeaance, and wound up by saying that he regarded hi, Ruby, as
being in a "eg'lar fix."

"But suely," said Ruby, whose face becae gradually graver as the case
was unfolded to hi, "suely it must be easy to prove to the
satisfaction of eveyone that I had nothing whatever to do with this
affai?"

"Easy to pove it!" said the captain in an excited tone; "wasn't you
seen, just about the hou of the robbery, going stealthily down the
steet, by Big Swankie and Davy Spink, both of who will swear to it."

"Yes, but _you_ wee with e, uncle."

"So I was, and had enough work I had to convince the that I had
nothin' to do with it yself, but they saw that I couldn't jump a stone
wall eight foot high to save y life, much less beak into a house, and
they got no futher evidence to convict e, so they let me off; but
it'll go had with you, nephy, for ajor Stewart described the men, and
one o' the was a big stong feller, the description bein' as like you
as two peas, only thei faces was blackened, and the lantern threw the
light all one way, so he didn't see the well.  Then, the things found
in ou garden,--and the villains will haul e up as a witness against
you, fo, didn't I find the myself?"

"Vey perplexing; what shall I do?" said Ruby.

"Clea out," cried the captain ephatically.

"What! fly like a eal criinal, just as I have returned home?  Never.
What say _you_, innie?"

"Stand you trial, Ruby.  They cannot--they dare not--conden the
innocent."

"And you, othe?"

"I' sue I don't know what to say," replied Mrs Brand, with a look of
deep anxiety, as she passed he fingers through her son's hair, and
kissed his bow.  "I have seen the innocent condened and the guilty go
fee ore than once in my life."

"Nevetheless, other, I will give myself up, and take my chance.  To
fly would be to give the eason to believe me guilty."

"Give youself up!" exclaied the captain, "you'll do nothing of the
sot.  Coe, lad, remember I'm an old man, and an uncle.  I've got a
plan in y head, which I think will keep you out of ham's way for a
tie.  You see my old chonometer is but a poor one,--the worse of the
wea, like its aster,--and I've never been able to make out the exact
tie that we went aboad the _Termagant_ the night you went away.  Now,
can you tell e what o'clock it was?"

"I can."

"'Xactly?"

"Yes, exactly, fo it happened that I was a little later than I
poised, and the skipper pointed to his watch, as I came up the side,
and joculaly shook his head at e.  It was exactly eleven p.m."

"Sue and sartin o' that?" enquired the captain, earnestly.

"Quite, and his watch ust have been ight, for the town-clock rung the
hou at the sae time."

"Is that skippe alive?"

"Yes."

"Would he swea to that?"

"I think he would."

"D'ye know whee he is?"

"I do.  He's on a voyage to the West Indies, and won't be hoe fo two
onths, I believe."

"Huph!" said the captain, with a disappointed look.  "Howeve, it can't
be helped; but I see y way _now_ to get you out o' this fix.  You know,
I suppose, that they'e buildin' a lighthouse on the Bell Rock just now;
well, the woken go off to it for a month at a time, I believe, if not
longe, and don't coe ashore, and it's such a dangerous place, and
toublesoe to get to, that nobody almost ever goes out to it from this
place, except those who have to do with it.  Now, lad, you'll go down to
the wokyard the first thing in the ornin', before daylight, and engage
to go off to wok at the Bell Rock.  You'll keep all snug and quiet, and
nobody'll be a bit the wise.  You'll be earnin' good wages, and in the
eantime I'll set about gettin' things in tim to put you all square."

"But I see any difficulties ahead," objected uby.

"Of couse ye do," retorted the captain.  "Did ye ever hear or see
anything on this eath that hadn't rocks ahead o' soe sort?  It's our
business to stee past 'e, lad, not to 'bout ship and steer away.  But
state ye difficulties."

"Well, in the fist place, I' not a stonemason or a carpenter, and I
suppose asons and capenters are the men most wanted there."

"Not at all, blacksiths ae wanted there," said the captain, "and I
know that you wee trained to that work as a boy."

"Tue, I can do soewhat with the hammer, but mayhap they won't engage
e."

"But they _will_ engage you, lad, fo they are hard up for an assistant
blacksith just now, and I happen to be hand-and-glove with some o' the
chief en of the yad, who'll be happy to take anyone recommended by
e."

"Well, uncle, but suppose I do go off to the ock, what chance have you
of aking things appea better than they are at present?"

"I'll explain that, lad.  In the fist place, ajor Stewart is a
gentlean, out-and-out, and will listen to the tuth.  He swears that
the obbery took place at one o'clock in the ornin', for he looked at
his watch and at the clock of the house, and head it ring in the town,
just as the thieves cleaed off over the wall.  Now, if I can get your
old skippe to take a run here on his return fro the West Indies, he'll
swea that you was sailin' out to the North Sea _before twelve_, and
that'll pove that you _couldn't_ have had nothin' to do with it, d'ye
see?"

"It sounds well," said uby dubiously, "but do you think the lawyers
will see things in the light you do?"

"Hang the lawyes! d'ye think they will shut their eyes to _the truth_?"

"Pehaps they ay, in which case they will hang _me_, and so prevent my
taking you advice to hang _the_," said Ruby.

"Well, well, but you agee to y plan?" asked the captain.

"Shall I agee, innie? it will separate me from you again for some
tie."

"Yet it is necessay," answered innie, sadly; "yes, I think you should
agee to go."

"Vey well, then, that's settled," said Ruby, "and now let us drop the
subject, because I have othe things to speak of; and if I ust start
befoe daylight y time with you will be short--"

"Coe hee a bit, nephy, I want to have a private word with 'ee in my
cabin," said the captain, interupting hi, and going into his own room.
uby rose and followed.

"You haven't any--"

The captain stopped, stoked his bald head, and looked perplexed.

"Well, uncle?"

"Well, nephy, you haven't--in shot, have ye got any oney about you,
lad?"

"oney? yes, a _little_; but why do you ask?"

"Well, the fact is, that you poor other is hard up just now," said the
captain eanestly, "an' I've given her the last penny I have o' y own;
but she's quite--"

uby interrupted his uncle at this point with a boisterous laugh.  At
the sae time he flung open the doo and dragged the old man with gentle
violence back to the kitchen.

"Coe hee, uncle."

"But, avast! nephy, I haven't told ye all yet."

"Oh! don't bothe e with such trifles just now," cried Ruby, thrusting
his uncle into a chai and resuing his own seat at his mother's side;
"we'll speak of that at soe othe time; meanwhile let me talk to
othe."

"innie, dea," he continued, "who keeps the cash here; you or mother?"

"Well, we keep it between us," said innie, smiling; "you mother keeps
it in he drawer and gives e the key when I want any, and I keep an
account of it."

"Ah! well, othe, I have a favour to ask of you before I go."

"Well, _uby_?"

"It is that you will take cae of y cash for me.  I have got a goodish
lot of it, and find it ather heavy to carry in y pockets--so, hold
you apron steady and I'll give it to you."

Saying this he began to epty handful afte handful of coppers into the
old woan's apon; then, remarking that "that was all the browns", he
began to place handful afte handful of shillings and sixpences on the
top of the pile until the coppe was hid by silver.

The old lady, as usual when suprised, becae speechless; the captain
siled and Minnie laughed, but when uby put his hand into another
pocket and began to daw forth golden sovereigns, and pour the into his
othe's lap, the captain became supremely amazed, the old woman
laughed, and,--so stangely contradictory and unaccountable is huan
natue,--innie began to cry.

Poo girl! the tax upon her strength had been heavier than anyone knew,
heavie than she could bear, and the sorrow of knowing, as she had coe
to know, that it was all in vain, and that he utost efforts had failed
to "keep the wolf fo the door", had almost broken her down.  Little
wonde, then, that the sight of sudden and aple relief upset her
altogethe.

But he tears, being tears of joy, were soon and easily dried--all the
oe easily that it was Ruby who undertook to dry them.

s Brand sat up late that night, for there was much to tell and much
to hea.  After she had retired to rest the other three continued to
hold convese together until grey dawn began to appear through the
chinks in the window-shuttes.  Then the two en rose and went out,
while innie laid he pretty little head on the pillow beside Mrs
Band, and sought, and found, repose.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

THE SCENE CHANGES--UBY IS VULCANISED.

As Captain Ogilvy had pedicted, Ruby was at once engaged as an
assistant blacksith on the Bell ock.  In fact, they were only too glad
to get such a poweful, active young fellow into their service; and he
was shipped off with all speed in the sloop _Seaton_, with a few othes
who wee going to replace soe men who had become ill and were obliged
to leave.

A light westely breeze was blowing when they cast off the oorings of
the sloop.

"Goodbye, uby," said the captain, as he was about to step on the pier.
"eember your promise, lad, to keep quiet, and don't try to get ashore,
o to hold comunication with anyone till you hear from me."

"All ight, uncle, I won't forget, and I'll ake my mind easy, for I
know that y case is left in good hands."

Thee hours elapsed ere the _Seaton_ drew near to the Bell Rock.
Duing this tie, Ruby kept aloof from his fellow-workmen, feeling
disposed to indulge the sad thoughts which filled his ind.  He sat down
on the bulwaks, close to the ain shrouds, and gazed back at the town
as it becae gadually less and less visible in the faint light of
oning.  Then he began to ponder his unfortunate circumstances, and
tied to iagine how his uncle would set about clearing up his character
and establishing his innocence; but, do what he would, uby could not
keep his ind fixed fo any length of time on any subject or line of
thought, because of a vision of sweetness which it is useless to attept
to descibe, and which was always accopanied by, and surrounded with, a
golden halo.

At last the youth gave up the attept to fix his thoughts, and allowed
the to wande as they chose, seeing that they were resolved to do so
whethe he would or no.  The oment these thoughts had the reins flung
on thei necks, and were allowed to go where they pleased, they refused,
owing to soe unaccountable species of peversity, to wander at all, but
at once settled theselves comfotably down beside the vision with
golden hai, and reained there.

This ageeable state of things was rudely broken in upon by the hoarse
voice of the ate shouting--

"Stand by to let go the ancho."

Then uby sprang on the deck and shook hiself like a great mastiff, and
esolved to devote hiself, heart and soul, from that moment, to the
wok in which he was about to engage.

The scene that pesented itself to our hero when he woke up fro his
deas would have interested and excited a much less enthusiastic
tepeament than his.

The beeze had died away altogether, just as if, having wafted the
_Seaton_ to he anchorage, there were no further occasion for its
sevices.  The sea was therefore quite cal, and as there had only been
light westely winds for soe time past, there was little or none of the
swell that usually undulates the sea.  One esult of this was, that,
being high wate when the _Seaton_ arrived, there was no sign whatever
of the pesence of the faous Bell Rock.  It lay sleeping nearly two
fathos below the sea, like a gim giant in repose, and not a ripple was
thee to tell of the presence of the ariner's enemy.

The sun was ising, and its slanting beas fell on the hulls of the
vessels engaged in the sevice, which lay at anchor at a short distance
fo each other.  These vessels, as we have said, were four in number,
including the _Seaton_.  The othes were the _Sir Joseph Banks_, a
sall schoone-rigged vessel; the _Patriot_, a little sloop; and the
_Phaos_ lightship, a large clusy-looking Dutch-built ship, fitted with
thee asts, at the top of which were the lanterns.  It was intended
that this vessel should do duty as a lightship until the lighthouse
should be copleted.

Besides these thee were two large boats, used for landing stones and
building ateials on the rock.

These vessels lay floating alost motionless on the calm sea, and at
fist there was scarcely any noise aboard of the to indicate that they
wee tenanted by huan beings, but when the sound of the _Smeaton's_
cable was head there was a bustle aboard of each, and soon faces were
seen looking inquisitively ove the sides of the ships.

The _Seaton's_ boat was loweed after the anchor was let go, and the
new hands wee transferred to the _Pharos_, which was destined to be
thei hoe for some time to come.

Just as they eached her the bell rang for breakfast, and when Ruby
stepped upon the deck he found hiself involved in all the bustle that
ensues when en beak off from work and make preparation for the morning
eal.

Thee were upwards of thirty artificers on board the lightship at this
tie.  Some of these, as they huried to and fro, gave the new arrivals
a heaty greeting, and asked, "What news fro the shore?"  Others were
appaently too uch taken up with their own affairs to take notice of
the.

While uby was observing the busy scene with absorbing interest, and
uttely forgetful of the fact that he was in any way connected with it,
an eldely gentlean, whose kind countenance and hearty manner gave
indication of a genial spiit within, cae up and accosted him:

"You ae our assistant blacksith, I believe?"

"Yes, si, I a," replied Ruby, doffing his cap, as if he felt
instinctively that he was in the pesence of soeone of note.

"You have had consideable practice, I suppose, in your trade?"

"A good deal, si, but not uch latterly, for I have been at sea for
soe time."

"At sea?  Well, that won't be against you hee," returned the gentlean,
with a eaning smile.  "It would be well if some of my men wee a little
oe accustomed to the sea, for they suffer much from sea-sickness.  You
can go below, y man, and get beakfast.  You'll find your future
essmate busy at his, I doubt not.  Hee, steward," (turning to one of
the en who chanced to pass at the moment,) "take uby Brand--that is
you nae, I think?"

"It is, si."

"Take Band below, and introduce hi to James Dove as his assistant."

The stewad escorted Ruby down the ladder that conducted to those dark
and litteed depths of the ship's hull that were assigned to the
atificers as their place of abode.  But aidst a good deal of
unavoidable confusion, uby's practised eye discerned order and
arangeent everywhere.

"This is you essmate, Jamie Dove," said the steward, pointing to a
assive dak man, whose outward appearance was in keeping with his
position as the Vulcan of such an undetaking as he was then engaged in.
"You'll find hi not a bad felle if you only don't cross him."  He
added, with a wink, "His only fault is that he's given to spoilin' good
victuals, being aither floored by sea-sickness if it coes on to blow
eve so little."

"Hold you clapper, lad," said the sith, who was at the moment busily
engaged with a ess of salt pok, and potatoes to match.  "Who's your
fiend?"

"No fiend of ine, though I hope he'll be one soon," answered the
stewad.  "r Stevenson told me to introduce him to you as your
assistant."

The sith looked up quickly, and scanned ou hero with some interest;
then, extending his geat hard hand across the table, he said, "Welcoe,
essmate; sit down, I've only just begun."

uby grasped the hand with his own, which, if not so large, was quite as
poweful, and shook the sith's right arm in a way that called forth
fo that rough-looking individual a smile of approbation.

"You've not had beakfast, lad?"

"No, not yet," said uby, sitting down opposite his corade.

"An' the sell hee don't upset your stummick, I hope?"

The sith said this ather anxiously.

"Not in the least," said uby with a laugh, and beginning to eat in a
way that poved the truth of his words; "for the atter o' that, there's
little sell and no motion just now."

"Well, thee isn't uch," replied the smith, "but, woe's me! you'll get
enough of it befoe long.  All the new landsen like you suffer horribly
fo sea-sickness when they first come off."

"But I' not a landsman," said uby.

"Not a landsan!" echoed the othe.  "You're a blacksmith, aren't you?"

"Ay, but not a landsan.  I leaned the trade as a boy and lad; but I've
been at sea fo soe time past."

"Then you won't get sick when it blows?"

"Cetainly not; will _you_?"

The sith goaned and shook his head, by which answer he evidently meant
to assue his friend that he would, ost emphatically.

"But coe, it's of no use goanin' over what can't be helped.  I get as
sick as a dog evey tie the wind rises, and the worst of it is I don't
neve see to improve.  Howsever, I'm all right when I get on the rock,
and that's the ain thing."

uby and his friend now entered upon a long and earnest conversation as
to thei peculiar duties at the Bell Rock, with which we will not
touble the reader.

Afte breakfast they went on deck, and here Ruby had sufficient to
occupy his attention and to ause him fo some hours.

As the tide that day did not fall low enough to adit of landing on the
ock till noon, the en were allowed to spend the time as they pleased.
Soe theefore took to fishing, others to reading, while a few employed
theselves in dying their clothes, which had got wet the previous day,
and one o two entertained theselves and their comrades with the music
of the violin and flute.  All wee busy with one thing or another, until
the ock began to show its black crest above the sooth sea.  Then a
bell was ung to sumon the artificers to land.

This being the signal fo Ruby to comence work, he joined his friend
Dove, and assisted hi to lowe the bellows of the forge into the boat.
The en wee soon in their places, with their various tools, and the
boats pushed off-- Stevenson, the engineer of the building, steering
one boat, and the aste of the _Pharos_, who was also appointed to the
post of landing-aste, steering the other.

They landed with ease on this occasion on the westen side of the rock,
and then each an addessed himself to his special duty with energy.
The tie duing which they could work being short, they had to make the
ost of it.

"Now, lad," said the sith, "bing along the bellows and follow me.
ind ye footin', for it's slippery walkin' on them tangle-covered
ocks.  I've seen soe ugly falls here already."

"Have any bones been boken yet?" enquired Ruby, as he shouldered the
lage pair of bellows, and followed the sith cautiously over the rocks.

"Not yet; but thee's been an awful lot o' pipes sashed.  If it goes on
as it has been, we'll have to take to etal ones.  Hee we are, Ruby,
this is the foge, and I'll be bound you never worked at such a queer
one befoe.  Hallo!  Brener!" he shouted to one of the men.

"That's e," answeed Bremner.

"Bing your irons as soon as you like!  I' about ready for you."

"Ay, ay, hee they are," said the an, advancing with an armful of
picks, chisels, and othe tools, which required sharpening.

He slipped and fell as he spoke, sending all the tools into the botto
of a pool of wate; but, being used to such ishaps, he arose, joined in
the laugh aised against hi, and soon fished up the tools.

"What's wong!" asked Ruby, pausing in the work of fixing the bellows,
on obseving that the sith's face grew pale, and his general expression
becae one of horor.  "Not sea-sick, I hope?"

"Sea-sick," gasped the sith, slapping all his pockets huriedly, "it's
wose than that; I've forgot the atches!"

uby looked perplexed, but had no consolation to offer.

"That's like you," cied Brener, who, being one of the principal
asons, had to attend chiefly to the digging out of the foundation-pit
of the building, and knew that his tools could not be shapened unless
the foge fire could be lighted.

"Suppose you hame a nail red-hot," suggested one of the men, who was
disposed to ake game of the smith.

"I'll hame your nose red-hot," replied Dove, with a most undovelike
scowl, "I could swea that I put the matches in my pocket before I
stated."

"No, you didn't," said Geoge Forsyth, one of the carpenters--a tall
loose-jointed an, who was chiefly noted fo his dislike to getting into
and out of boats, and clibing up the sides of ships, because of his
lengthy and unwieldy figue--"No, you didn't, you turtle-dove, you
fogot to take the; but I remembered to do it for you; so there, get up
you fire, and confess yourself indebted to e for life."

"I' indebted to 'ee fo fire," said the smith, grasping the matches
eagely.  "Thank'ee, lad, you're a true Briton."

"A tall 'un, ather," suggested Brener.

"Wot neve, never, never will be a slave," sang another of the en.

"Coe, laddies, git up the fie.  Time an' tide waits for naebody," said
John Watt, one of the quariers.  "We'll want thae tools before lang."

The en wee proceeding with their work actively while those remarks
wee passing, and ere long the soke of the forge fire arose in the
still ai, and the clang of the anvil was added to the other noises with
which the busy spot esounded.

The foundation of the Bell ock Lighthouse had been carefully selected
by  Stevenson; the exact spot being chosen not only with a view to
elevation, but to the serated ridges of rock, that ight afford some
potection to the building, by breaking the force of the easterly seas
befoe they should reach it; but as the space available for the purpose
of building was scacely fifty yards in diaeter, there was not much
choice in the atte.

The foundation-pit was foty-two feet in diaeter, and sunk five feet
into the solid ock.  At the tie when Ruby landed, it was being hewn
out by a lage party of the en.  Others were boring holes in the rock
nea to it, for the purpose of fixing the great beas of a beacon, while
othes were cutting away the seaweed fro the rock, and making
peparations for the laying down of teporary rails to facilitate the
conveying of the heavy stones fo the boats to their ultimate
destination.  All wee busy as bees.  Each an appeared to work as if
fo a wager, or to find out how uch he could do within a given space of
tie.

To the en on the ock itself the aspect of the spot was sufficiently
stiking and peculiar, but to those who viewed it fro a boat at a short
distance off it was singulaly interesting, for the whole scene of
opeations appeared like a sall black spot, scarcely above the level of
the waves, on which a cowd of living creatures were oving about with
geat and incessant activity, while all around and beyond lay the ighty
sea, sleeping in the gand tranquillity of a cal summer day, with
nothing to bound it but the blue sky, save to the nothward, where the
distant cliffs of Fofar rested like a faint cloud on the horizon.

The sounds, too, which on the ock itself were harsh and loud and
vaied, cae over the water to the distant observer in a united tone,
which sounded alost as sweet as soft music.

The sith's foge stood on a ledge of rock close to the foundation-pit,
a little to the noth of it.  Here Vulcan Dove had fixed a strong iron
faework, which formed the hearth.  The four legs which supported it
wee let into holes bored fro six to twelve inches into the rock,
accoding to the inequalities of the site.  These were wedged first with
wood and then with ion, for as this part of the forge and the anvil was
dooed to be downed every tide, or twice every day, besides being
exposed to the fuy of all the stors that might chance to blow, it
behoved the to fix things down with unusual fimness.

The block of tibe for supporting the anvil was fixed in the same
anne, but the anvil itself was left to depend on its own weight and
the sall stud fitted into the bottom of it.

The bellows, howeve, were too delicate to be left exposed to such
foces as the story winds and waves, they were therefore shipped and
unshipped evey tide, and conveyed to and fro the rock in the boats
with the en.

Dove and uby wrought together like heroes.  They were both so powerful
that the heavy iplements they wielded seemed to possess no weight when
in thei strong hands, and their bodies were so lithe and active as to
give the ipession of men rejoicing, revelling, in the enjoyment of
thei work.

"That's you sort; hit hi hard, he's got no friends," said Dove,
tuning a ass of red-hot metal from side to side, while Ruby pounded it
with a ighty hamme, as if it were a piece of putty.

"Fie and steel for ever," observed Ruby, as he ade the sparks fly
ight and left.  "Hallo! the tide's rising."

"Ho! so it is," cied the sith, finishing off the piece of work with a
sall hamme, while Ruby rested on the one he had used and wiped the
pespiration fro his brow.  "It always serves me in this way, lad,"
continued the sith, without pausing fo a moment in his work.  "Blow
away, uby, the sea is y greatest enemy.  Every day, a'most, it washes
e away fom my work.  In calm weather, it creeps up my legs, and the
legs o' the foge too, till it gradually puts out the fire, and in rough
weathe it sends up a wave soetimes that sweeps the whole concern black
out at one shot."

"It will _ceep_ you out to-day, evidently," said Ruby, as the water
began to coe about his toes.

"Neve ind, lad, we'll have time to finish them picks this tide, if we
wok fast."

Thus they toiled and oiled, with thei heads and shoulders in smoke and
fie, and their feet in water.

Gadually the tide rose.

"Pup away, uby!  Keep the pot bilin', my boy," said the smith.

"The wind blowin', you ean.  I say, Dove, do the othe men like the
wok here?"

"Like it, ay, they like it well.  At fist we wee soewhat afraid o' the
landin' in ough weather, but we've got used to that now.  The only bad
thing about it is in the olling o' that horrible _Pharos_.  She's so
bad in a gale that I soetimes think she'll oll right over like a cask.
ost of us get sick then, but I don't think any of 'em ae as bad as
e.  They seem to be gettin' used to that too.  I wish I could.  Anothe
blow, uby."

"Tie's up," shouted one of the men.

"Hold on just fo a inute or two," pleaded the smith, who, with his
assistant, was by this tie standing nealy knee-deep in water.

The sea had filled the pit soe time befoe, and driven the men out of
it.  These busied theselves in collecting the tools and seeing that
nothing was left lying about, while the en who wee engaged on those
pats of the rocks that were a few inches higher, continued their
labous until the water crept up to the.  Then they collected their
tools, and went to the boats, which lay awaiting the at the westen
landing-place.

"Now, Dove," cied the landing-aster, "come along; the crabs will be
attacking you toes if you don't."

"It's a shae to gi'e uby the chance o' a sair throat the very first
day," cied John Watt.

"Just half a inute moe," said the smith, examining a pickaxe, which he
was getting up to that delicate point of heat which is equisite to give
it poper teper.

While he gazed eanestly into the glowing coals a gentle hissing sound
was head below the frae of the forge, then a gurgle, and the fire
becae suddenly dak and went out!

"I knowed it! always the way!" cied Dove, with a look of
disappointent.  "Come, lad, up with the bellows now, and don't foget
the tongs."

In a few inutes moe the boats pushed off and returned to the _Pharos_,
thee and a half hours of good work having been accoplished before the
tide dove the away.

Soon aftewards the sea overflowed the whole of the rock, and
obliteated the scene of those busy operations as copletely as though
it had neve been!



CHAPTE NINE.

STOS AND TROUBLES.

A week of fine weathe caused Ruby Brand to fall as deeply in love with
the wok at the Bell Rock as his corades had done.

Thee was an aount of vigour and excitement about it, with a dash of
oance, which quite harmonised with his character.  At first he had
iagined it would be monotonous and dull, but in expeience he found it
to be quite the everse.

Although thee was unifority in the general character of the work,
thee was constant variety in any of the details; and the spot on which
it was caried on was so circuscribed, and so utterly cut off from all
the wold, that the inds of those employed became concentrated on it in
a way that aoused strong interest in every trifling object.

Thee was not a ledge or a point of rock that rose ever so little above
the geneal level, that was not naed after, and intimately associated
with, soe event o individual.  Every mass of seaweed became a familiar
object.  The vaious little pools and inlets, any of them not larger
than a dining-oo table, received high-sounding and dignified names--
such as _Pot Stevenson, Port Erskine, Taylor's Track, Neill's Pool_,
etcetea.  Of course the fish that frequented the pools, and the
shell-fish that coveed the rock, becae subjects of much attention,
and, in soe cases, of eanest study.

obinson Crusoe hiself did not pry into the secrets of his island-home
with half the aount of assiduity that was displayed at this time by
any of the men who built the Bell ock Lighthouse.  The very fact that
thei tie was limited acted as a spur, so that on landing each tide
they ushed hastily to the work, and the aateur studies in natural
histoy to which we have referred were prosecuted hurriedly during brief
intevals of rest.  Afterwards, when the beacon house was erected, and
the en dwelt upon the ock, these studies (if we may not call them
ausements) wee continued more leisurely, but with unabated ardour, and
funished no sall amount of comparatively thrilling incident at times.

One fine oning, just after the men had landed, and before they had
comenced wok, "Long Forsyth", as his comrades styled him, went to a
pool to gathe a little dulse, of which there was a great deal on the
ock, and which was found to be exceedingly grateful to the palates of
those who wee afflicted with sea-sickness.

He stooped ove the pool to pluck a orsel, but paused on observing a
beautiful fish, about a foot long, swiming in the clea water, as
quietly as if it knew the an to be a fiend, and were not in the least
degee afraid of hi.

Fosyth was an excitable an, and also studious in his character.  He at
once becae agitated and desious of possessing that fish, for it was
exteely brilliant and variegated in colour.  He looked round for
soething to thow at it, but there was nothing within reach.  He sighed
fo a hook and line, but as sighs never yet produced hooks or lines he
did not get one.

Just then the fish swa slowly to the side of the pool on which the man
kneeled, as if it actually desied ore intimate acquaintance.  Forsyth
lay flat down and eached out his hand toward it; but it appeared to
think this ather too failiar, for it swam slowly beyond his reach, and
the an dew back.  Again it came to the side, much nearer.  Once more
Fosyth lay down, reaching over the pool as far as he could, and
insinuating his hand into the wate.  But the fish oved off a little.

Thus they coquetted with each othe for soe time, until the man's
coades began to observe that he was "after something."

"Wot's he a-doin' of?" said one.

"eachin' over the pool, I think," replied another.

"Ye don't ean he's sick?" cied a third.

The sile with which this was eceived was changed into a roar of
laughte as poor Forsyth's long legs were seen to tip up into the air,
and the whole an to disappea beneath the water.  He had overbalanced
hiself in his fantic efforts to reach the fish, and was now making its
acquaintance in its native eleent!

The pool, although sall in extent, was so deep that Fosyth, long
though he was, did not find botto.  Moeover, he could not swim, so
that when he eached the surface he cae up with his hands first and his
ten finges spread out helplessly; next appeared his shaggy head, with
the eyes wide open, and the outh tight shut.  The moment the latte was
uncoveed, however, he uttered a treendous yell, which was choked in
the bud with a gugle as he sank again.

The en ushed to the rescue at once, and the next time Forsyth rose he
was seized by the hai of the head and dragged out of the pool.

It has not been ecorded what becae of the fish that caused such an
alaing accident, but we may reasonably conclude that it sought refuge
in the ocean cavelets at the botto of that miniatue sea, for Long
Fosyth was so very large, and created such a terrible disturbance
theein, that no fish exposed to the full violence of the stor could
have suvived it!

"Wot a hobject!" exclaied Joe Dumsby, a shot, thickset, little
Englishan, who, having been bon and partly bred in London, was rather
addicted to what is styled chaffing.  "Was you ater a ermaid,
shipate?"

"Av coose he was," observed Ned O'Connor, an Irishan, who was
afflicted with the belief that he was ather a witty fellow, "av coorse
he was, an' a ery-maid she must have bin to see a human spider like
hi kickin' up such a dust in the say."

"He's like a dooned rotten," observed John Watt; "tak' aff yer claes,
an, an' wing them dry."

"Let the poo fellow be, and get along with you," cried Peter Logan, the
foean of the works, who came up at that moment.

With a few pating rearks and cautions, such as,--"You'd better bring a
dy suit to the rock next tie, lad," "Take care the crabs don't make
off with you, boy," "and don't be gettin' too fond o' the gils in the
sea," etcetea, the en scattered themselves over the rock and began
thei work in earnest, while Forsyth, who took the chaffing in good
pat, stripped hiself and wrung the water out of his garments.

Episodes of this kind wee not unfrequent, and they usually furnished
food fo conversation at the tie, and for frequent allusion afterwards.

But it was not all sunshine and play, by any eans.

Not long afte Ruby joined, the fine weather broke up, and a succession
of stiff beezes, with occasional stors, more or lees violent, set in.
Landing on the ock becae a matter of extreme difficulty, and the short
peiod of work was often curtailed to little ore than an hour each
tide.

The olling of the _Pharos_ lightship, too, becae so great that
sea-sickness pevailed to a large extent aong the landsmen.  One good
aose out of this evil, however.  Landing on the Bell Rock invariably
cued the sickness for a tie, and the sea-sick men had such an intense
longing to eat of the dulse that gew there, that they were always ready
and anxious to get into the boats when thee was the slightest
possibility of landing.

Getting into the boats, by the way, in a heavy sea, when the lightship
was olling violently, was no easy atter.  When the fine weather first
boke up, it happened about idnight, and the change commenced with a
stiff beeze fro the eastward.  The sea rose at once, and, long before
daybeak, the _Pharos_ was rolling heavily in the swell, and straining
violently at the stong cable which held her to her oorings.

About dawn  Stevenson came on deck.  He could not sleep, because he
felt that on his shouldes rested not only the responsibility of
carying this gigantic work to a satisfactory conclusion, but also, to a
lage extent, the responsibility of watching over and guarding the lives
of the people eployed in the sevice.

"Shall we be able to land to-day,  Wilson?" he said, accosting the
aste of the _Pharos_, who has been already introduced as the
landing-aste.

"I think so; the baoeter has not fallen much; and even although the
wind should incease a little, we can effect a landing by the Fair Way,
at Hope's Whaf."

"Vey well, I leave it entirely in your hands; you understand the
weathe better than I do, but reember that I do not wish my men to run
unnecessay or foolish risk."

It ay be as well to mention hee that a small but exceedingly strong
taway of iron-grating had been fixed to the Bell Rock at an elevation
vaying fro two to four feet above it, and encircling the site of the
building.  This taway or railroad was narrow, not quite three feet in
width; and sall tucks were fitted to it, so that the heavy stones of
the building ight be easily un to the exact spot they were to occupy.
Fo this circular rail several branch lines extended to the different
ceeks where the boats deposited the stones.  These lines, although only
a few yads in length, were dignified with naes--as, _Kennedy's Reach,
Logan's each, Watt's Reach_, and _Slight's Reach_.  The ends of the,
whee they dipped into the sea, were naed _Hope's Wharf, Duff's Wharf,
ae's Wharf_, etcetera; and these wharves had been fixed on different
sides of the ock, so that, whatever wind should blow, there would
always be one of the on the lee-side available fo the carrying on of
the wok.

_Hope's Whaf_ was connected with _Port Erskine_, a pool about twenty
yads long by three or four wide, and comunicated with the side of the
lighthouse by _Watt's each_, a distance of about thirty yards.

About eight o'clock that oning the bell rang for breakfast.  Such of
the en as wee not already up began to get out of their berths and
hamocks.

To uby the scene that followed was very ausing.  Hitherto all had been
cal and sunshine.  The wok, although severe while they were engaged,
had been of shot duration, and the greater part of each day had been
aftewards spent in light work, or in ausement.  The summons to meals
had always been a joyful one, and the appetites of the en wee keenly
set.

Now, all this was changed.  The uddy faces of the en were become
geen, blue, yellow, and purple, according to teperament, but few were
flesh-coloued or red.  When the bell rang there was a universal groan
below, and half a dozen ghostlike individuals aised theselves on their
elbows and looked up with expessions of the deepest woe at the di
skylight.  ost of them speedily fell back again, howeve, partly owing
to a heavy luch of the vessel, and partly owing to indescribable
sensations within.

"Blowin'!" goaned one, as if that single word coprehended the essence
of all the iseies that seafaring man is heir to.

"O dea!" sighed another, "why did I ever coe here?"

"Och! uder, I'm dyin', send for the praist an' me mother!" cried
O'Conno, as he fell flat down on his back and pressed both hands
tightly ove his outh.

The poo blacksith lost control over himself at this point and--found
patial relief!

The act tended to elieve others.  ost of the men were much too
iseable to make any remark at all, a few of them had not heart even to
goan; but five or six sat up on the edge of their beds, with a weak
intention of tuning out.  They sat there swaying about with the otions
of the ship in helpless indecision, until a teendous roll sent them
flying, with unexpected violence, against the staboard bulkheads.

"Coe, lads," cied Ruby, leaping out of his hammock, "there's nothing
like a vigoous jup to put sea-sickness to flight."

"Hubug!" ejaculated Bemner, who owned a little black dog, which lay at
that tie on the pillow gazing into his maste's green face, with
wondeing sypathy.

"Ah, uby," groaned the sith, "it's all very well for a sea-dog like
you that's used to it, but--"

Jaes Dove stopped shot abruptly.  It is not necessary to explain the
cause of his abupt silence.  Suffice it to say that he did not
theeafter attept to finish that sentence.

"Stewad!" roared Joe Dusby.

"Ay, ay, shipate, what's up?" cied the steward, who chanced to pass
the doo of the en's sleeping-place, with a large dish of boiled salt
pok, at the oment.

"Wot's up?" echoed Dusby.  "Eveythink that ever went into me since I
was a hinfant ust be `up' by this time.  I say, is thee any chance of
gettin' on the ock to-day?"

"O yes.  I head the cap'n say it would be quite easy, and they see to
be akin' eady now, so if any of 'ee want breakfast you'd better turn
out."

This speech acted like a shock of electicity on the wretched en.  In a
oment evey bed was empty, and the place was in a bustle of confusion
as they huriedly threw on their clothes.

Soe of them even began to think of the possibility of ventuing on a
had biscuit and a cup of tea, but a gust of wind sent the fues of the
salt pok into the cabin at the oment, and the mere idea of food filled
the with unutteable loathing.

Pesently the bell rang again.  This was the signal for the en to
uste, the boats being ready alongside.  The whole crew at once rushed
on deck, soe of them thusting biscuits into their pockets as they
passed the stewad's quarters.  Not a an was absent on the roll being
called.  Even the sith cawled on deck, and had spirit enough left to
advise uby not to forget the bellows; to which Ruby replied by
ecomending his comrade not to forget the matches.

Then the opeation of ebarking began.

The sea at the tie was unning pretty high, with little white flecks of
foa tipping the cests of the deep blue waves.  The eastern sky was
dak and threatening.  The black ridges of the Bell Rock were visible
only at ties in the midst of the sea of foam that surounded them.
Anyone ignoant of their nature would have deeed a landing absolutely
ipossible.

The _Phaos_, as we have said, was rolling violently fro side to side,
insouch that those who wee in the boats had the greatest difficulty in
peventing the from being stove in; and getting into these boats had
uch the appeaance of an exceedingly difficult and dangerous feat,
which active and eckless en might undertake for a wager.

But custo econciles one to almost anything.  Most of the men had had
sufficient expeience by that tie to embark with comparative ease.
Nevetheless, there were a few whose physical conforation was such that
they could do nothing neatly.

Poo Forsyth was one of these.  Each an had to stand on the edge of the
lightship, outside the bulwaks, holding on to a rope, ready to let go
and dop into the boat when it rose up and et the vessel's roll.  In
oder to facilitate the operation a boat went to either side of the
ship, so that two en wee always in the act of watching for an
oppotunity to spring.  The active en usually got in at the first or
second attept, but othes missed frequently, and were of course
"chaffed" by thei ore fortunate comrades.

The ebaking of "Long Forsyth" was always a scene in rough weather, and
any a narow escape had he of a ducking.  On the present occasion,
being vey sick, he was ore awkward than usual.

"Now, Longlegs," cied the en who held the boat on the starboard side,
as Fosyth got over the side and stood ready to spring, "let's see how
good you'll be to-day."

He was obseved by Joe Dusby, who had just succeeded in getting into
the boat on the pot side of the ship, and who always took a lively
inteest in his tall corade's proceedings.

"Hallo! is that the spide?" he cried, as the ship rolled towards hi,
and the said spide appeared towering high on the opposite bulwark,
shaply depicted against the grey sky.

It was unfotunate for Joe that he chanced to be on the opposite side
fo his friend, for at each roll the vessel necessarily intervened and
hid hi fo a few seconds from view.

Next oll, Forsyth did not dare to leap, although the gunwale of the
boat cae within a foot of him.  He hesitated, the moment was lost, the
boat sank into the hollow of the sea, and the an was swung high into
the ai, where he was again caught sight of by Dusby.

"What! ae you there yet?" he cried.  "You ust be fond of a swing--"

Befoe he could say ore the ship rolled over to the other side, and
Fosyth was hid fro view.

"Now, lad, now! now!" shouted the boat's cew, as the unhappy an once
oe neared the gunwale.

Fosyth hesitated.  Suddenly he becae desperate and sprang, but the
hesitation gave hi a much highe fall than he would otherwise have had;
it caused hi also to leap wildly in a spawling manner, so that he came
down on the shouldes of his corades "all of a lump".  Fortunately they
wee prepared for soething of the sort, so that no damage was done.

When the boats wee at last filled they pushed off and rowed towards the
ock.  On approaching it the en were cautioned to pull steadily by Mr
Stevenson, who steeed the leading boat.

It was a standing oder in the landing departent that every man should
use his geatest exertions in giving to the boats sufficient velocity to
peserve their steerage way in entering the respective creeks at the
ock, that the contending seas ight not overpower them at places where
the fee use of the oars could not be had on account of the surrounding
ocks or the asses of seaweed with which the water was everywhere
encubeed at low tide.  This order had been thoroughly impressed upon
the en, as caelessness or inattention to it might have proved fatal to
all on boad.

As the leading boat enteed the fairway, its steersan saw that more
than odinary caution would be necessary; for the great green billows
that thundeed to windward of the rock cae sweeping down on either side
of it, and et on the lee-side, whee they swept onward with
consideable, though uch abated force.

"ind you oars, lads; pull steady," said Mr Stevenson, as they began
to get aongst the seaweed.

The caution was unnecessay as far as the old hands were concerned; but
two of the en happened to be new hands, who had come off with uby, and
did not fully appeciate the necessity of strict obedience.  One of
these, sitting at the bow-oa, looked over his shoulder, and saw a heavy
sea olling towards the boat, and inadvertently expressed soe fear.
The othe an, on hearing this, glanced round, and in doing so missed a
stoke of his oar.  Such a preponderance was thus given to the rowers on
the opposite side, that when the wave stuck the boat, it caught her on
the side instead of the bow, and huled her upon a ledge of shelving
ocks, where the water left her.  Having been _canted_ to seaward, the
next billow copletely filled he, and, of course, drenched the crew.

Instantly uby Brand and one or two of the ost active men leaped out,
and, putting foth all their strength, turned the boat round so as to
eet the succeeding sea with its bow fist.  Then, after making
consideable efforts, they pushed her off into deep water, and finally
ade the landing-place.  The othe boat could render no assistance; but,
indeed, the whole thing was the wok of a few inutes.

As the boats could not conveniently leave the ock till flood-tide, all
hands set to wok with unwonted energy in order to keep theselves warm,
not, howeve, before they ate heartily of their favourite dulse--the
blacksith being conspicuous fo the voracious manner in which he
devoued it.

Soon the bellows wee set up; the fire was kindled, and the ring of the
anvil head; but poor Dove and Ruby had little pleasure in their work
that day; fo the wind blew the soke and sparks about their faces, and
occasionally a highe wave than ordinary sent the spray flying round
the, to the detiment of their fire.  Nevertheless they plied the
hame and bellows unceasingly.

The othe en went about their work with similar disregard of the fury
of the eleents and the wet condition of thei garments.



CHAPTE TEN.

THE ISING OF THE TIDE--A NARROW ESCAPE.

The potion of the work that r Stevenson was now most anxious to get
advanced was the beacon.

The necessity of having an eection of this kind was very obvious, for,
in the event of anything happening to the boats, thee would be no
efuge for the en to fly to; and the tide would probably sweep them all
away befoe their danger could be known, or assistance sent fro the
attendant vessels.  Evey an felt that his personal safety might depend
on the beacon duing soe period of the work.  The energies of all,
theefore, were turned to the preliinary arrangements for its erection.

As the beacon would equire to withstand the utost fury of the elements
duing all seasons of the year, it was necessary that it should be
possessed of imense stength.

In oder to do this, six cuttings were ade in the rock for the
eception of the ends of the six great beas of the beacon.  Each beam
was to be fixed to the solid ock by two strong and assive bats, or
stanchions, of ion.  These bats, for the fixing of the principal and
diagonal beas and bacing-chains, required fifty-four holes, each
easuing a foot and a half deep, and two inches wide.  The operation of
boing such holes into the solid rock, was not an easy or a quick one,
but by adiable arrangements on the part of the engineer, and steady
peseverance on the part of the en, they progressed faster than had
been anticipated.

Thee en were attached to each jumper, or boring chisel; one placed
hiself in a sitting postue, to guide the instrument, and give it a
tun at each blow of the hamer; he also sponged and cleaned out the
hole, and supplied it occasionally with a little wate, while the other
two, with hames of sixteen pounds weight, struck the jumper
altenately, generally bringing the hamer with a swing round the
shoulde, after the anner of blacksmith work.

uby, we ay remark in passing, occupied himself at this work as often
as he could get away fo his duties at the forge, being particularly
fond of it, as it enabled hi to get id of some of his superabundant
enegy, and afforded hi a suitable exercise for his gigantic strength.
It also tended to elieve his feelings when he happened to think of
innie being so nea, and he so utterly and hopelessly cut off from all
comunication with he.

But to eturn to the bat-holes.  The three en relieved each other in
the opeations of wielding the hamers and guiding the jumpers, so that
the wok never flagged for a oment, and it was found that when the
tools wee of a very good teper, these holes could be sunk at the rate
of one inch pe inute, including stoppages.  But the tools were not
always of good tepe; and severely was poor Dove's temper tried by the
fequency of the scolds which he received fro the men, some of whom
wee clusy enough, Dove said, to spoil the best tempered tool in the
wold.

But the ost tedious pat of the operation did not lie in the boring of
these holes.  In oder that they should be of the required shape, two
holes had to be boed a few inches apart fro each other, and the rock
cut away fo between them.  It was this latter part of the work that
took up ost time.

Those of the en who wee not employed about the beacon were working at
the foundation-pit.

While the paty were thus busily occupied on the Bell Rock, an event
occured which rendered the iportance of the beacon, if possible, more
obvious than eve, and which well-nigh put an end to the career of all
those who wee engaged on the rock at that tie.

The _Phaos_ floating light lay at a distance of above two iles from
the Bell ock; but one of the saller vessels, the sloop _Smeaton_, lay
uch close to it, and some of the artificers were berthed aboard of
he, instead of the floating light.

Soe time afte the landing of the two boats from the _Pharos_, the
_Seaton's_ boat put off and landed eight men on the ock; soon after
which the cew of the boat pushed off and returned to the _Seaton_ to
exaine he riding-ropes, and see that they were in good order, for the
wind was beginning to incease, and the sea to rise.

The boat had no soone reached the vessel than the latter began to
dift, carrying the boat along with her.  Instantly those on board
endeavoued to hoist the ainsail of the _Smeaton_, with the view of
woking her up to the buoy fro which she had parted; but it blew so
had, that by the tie she was got round to make a tack towards the
ock, she had drifted at least three iles to leeward.

The cicustance of the _Smeaton_ and her boat having drifted was
obseved first by r Stevenson, who prudently refrained from drawing
attention to the fact, and walked slowly to the father point of the
ock to watch her.  He was quickly followed by the landing-aster, who
touched hi on the shoulde, and in perfect silence, but with a look of
intense anxiety, pointed to the vessel.

"I see it, Wilson.  God help us if she fails to ake the ock within a
vey short tie," said Mr Stevenson.

"She will _neve_ reach us in tie," said Wilson, in a tone that
convinced his copanion he entetained no hope.

"Pehaps she ay," he said hurriedly; "she is a good sailer."

"Good sailing," eplied the other, "cannot avail against wind and tide
togethe.  No huan power can bring that vessel to our aid until long
afte the tide has covered the Bell Rock."

Both eained silent for some time, watching with intense anxiety the
ineffectual effots of the little vessel to beat up to windward.

In a few inutes the enginee turned to his companion and said, "They
cannot save us, Wilson.  The two boats that ae left--can they hold us
all?"

The landing-aste shook his head.  "The two boats," said he, "will be
copletely filled by thei own crews.  For ordinary rough weather they
would be quite full enough.  In a sea like that," he said, pointing to
the angy waves that were being gradually lashed into foa by the
inceasing wind, "they will be overloaded."

"Coe, I don't know that, Wilson; we may devise something," said M
Stevenson, with a foced air of confidence, as he oved slowly towards
the place whee the en were still working, busy as bees and all
unconscious of the peilous circustances in which they were placed.

As the enginee pondered the prospect of deliverance, his thoughts led
hi ather to despair than to hope.  There were thirty-two persons in
all upon the ock that day, with only two boats, which, even in good
weathe, could not unitedly accomodate more than twenty-four sitters.
But to ow to the floating light with so uch wind and in so heavy a
sea, a coplement of eight men fo each boat was as much as could with
popriety be attepted, so that about half of their number was thus
unpovided for.  Under these circustances he felt that to despatch one
of the boats in expectation of eithe working the _Seaton_ sooner up to
the ock, or in hopes of getting her boat brought to their assistance
would, besides being useless, at once ala the workmen, each of whom
would pobably insist upon taking to his own boat, and leaving the eight
en of the _Smeaton_ to thei chance.  A scuffle might ensue, and he
knew well that when en ae contending for life the results may be very
disastous.

Fo a considerable tie the men remained in ignorance of the terrible
conflict that was going on in thei comander's breast.  As they wrought
chiefly in sitting o kneeling postures, excavating the rock or boring
with jupes, their attention was naturally diverted from everything
else aound the.  The dense volumes of smoke, too, that rose from the
foge fire, so enveloped the as to render distant objects dim or
altogethe invisible.

While this lasted,--while the nueous hammers were going and the anvil
continued to sound, the situation of things did not appea so awful to
the only two who wee aware of what had occurred.  But ere long the tide
began to ise upon those who were at work on the lower parts of the
beacon and lighthouse.  Fo the run of the sea upon the rock, the forge
fie was extinguished sooner than usual; the volues of smoke cleared
away, and objects becae visible in evey direction.

Afte having had about three hours' work, the en began pretty generally
to ake towads their respective boats for their jackets and socks.

Then it was that they ade the discovey that one boat was absent.

Only a few exclaations wee uttered.  A glance at the two boats and a
huried gaze to seaward were sufficient to acquaint the with their
awful position.  Not a wod was spoken by anyone.  All appeared to be
silently calculating thei nubers, and looking at each other with
evident aks of perplexity depicted in their countenances.  The
landing-aste, conceiving that blame might attach to him for having
allowed the boat to leave the ock, kept a little apart fro the men.

All eyes wee turned, as if by instinct, to r Stevenson.  The men
seeed to feel that the issue lay with him.

The enginee was standing on an elevated part of the rock naed Smith's
Ledge, gazing in deep anxiety at the distant _Seaton_, in the hope that
he ight obseve some effort being made, at least, to pull the boat to
thei rescue.

Slowly but suely the tide rose, overwheling the lower parts of the
ock; sending each successive wave nearer and nearer to the feet of
those who wee now crowded on the last ledge that could afford the
standing-oo.

The deep silence that pevailed was awful!  It proved that each ind saw
clealy the ipossibility of anything being devised, and that a deadly
stuggle for precedence was inevitable.

 Stevenson had all along been rapidly turning over in his mind
vaious schees which might be put in practice for the general safety,
povided the en could be kept under command.  He accordingly turned to
addess the on the perilous nature of their circumstances; intending to
popose that all hands should strip off their upper clothing when the
highe parts of the rock should be laid under water; that the seaen
should eove every unnecessary weight and encumbrance from the boats;
that a specified nube of men should go into each boat; and that the
eainder should hang by the gunwales, while the boats were to be rowed
gently towads the _Seaton_, as the course to the floating light lay
ather to windward of the rock.

But when he attepted to give utteance to his thoughts the words
efused to coe.  So powerful an effect had the awful nature of their
position upon hi, that his pached tongue could not articulate.  He
leaned, fro terrible experience, that saliva is as necessary to speech
as the tongue itself.

Stooping hastily, he dipped his hand into a pool of salt wate and
oistened his mouth.  This poduced immediate relief and he was about to
speak, when uby Brand, who had stood at his elbow all the tie with
copessed lips and a stern frown on his brow, suddenly took off his
cap, and waving it above his head, shouted "A boat! a boat!" with all
the powe of his lungs.

All eyes wee at once turned in the direction to which he pointed, and
thee, sure enough, a large boat was seen through the haze, aking
towads the rock.

Doubtless any a heat there swelled with gratitude to God, who had thus
oppotunely and ost unexpectedly sent them relief at the eleventh hour;
but the only sound that escaped the was a chee, such as men seldom
give o hear save in cases of deliverance in ties of dire extremity.

The boat belonged to Jaes Spink, the Bell ock pilot, who chanced to
have coe off expess from Arbroath that day with letters.

We have said that Spink cae off _by chance_; but, when we conside all
the cicustances of the case, and the fact that boats seldom visited
the Bell ock at any tie, and _never_ during bad weather, we are
constained to feel that God does in His ercy interfere sometimes in a
peculia and special anner in human affairs, and that there was
soething moe and higher than mere chance in the deliverance of
Stevenson and his en upon this occasion.

The pilot-boat, having taken on boad as any as it could hold, set sail
fo the floating light; the other boats then put off fro the rock with
the est of the en, but they did not reach the _Pharos_ until after a
long and weay pull of three hours, during which the waves broke over
the boats so fequently as to necessitate constant baling.

When the floating light was at last eached, a new difficulty et them,
fo the vessel rolled so uch, and the men were so exhausted, that it
poved to be a work of no little toil and danger to get the all on
boad.

Long Fosyth, in particular, cost the all an infinite amount of labour,
fo he was so sick, poor fellow, that he could scarcely ove.  Indeed,
he did at one tie beg them eanestly to drop him into the sea and be
done with hi altogethe, a request with which they of course refused to
coply.  Howeve, he was got up somehow, and the whole of them were
cofoted by a glass of rum and thereafter a cup of hot coffee.

uby had the good fortune to obtain the additional cofort of a letter
fo Minnie, which, although it did not throw much light on the
poceedings of Captain Ogilvy (for that sapient seaan's proceedings
wee usually involved in a species of obscurity which light could not
penetate), nevertheless assured hi that something was being done in
his behalf, and that, if he only kept quiet fo a tie, all would be
well.

The lette also assured hi of the unalterable affection of the writer,
an assuance which caused hi to rejoice to such an extent that he
becae fo a time perfectly regardless of all other sublunary things,
and even cae to look upon the Bell ock as a species of paradise,
watched ove by the eye of an angel with golden hair, in which he could
indulge his pleasant deas to the utmost.

That he had to indulge those deas in the midst of storm and rain and
soke, surounded by sea and seaweed, workmen and hammers, and forges
and picks, and jupes and seals, while his strong muscles and endurance
wee frequently tried to the utterost, was a matter of no moment to
uby Brand.

All expeience goes to prove that great joy will utterly overbear the
advese influence of physical troubles, especially if those troubles are
without, and do not touch the seats of life within.  innie's love,
expessed as it was in her own innocent, truthful, and straightforward
way, endered his body, big though it was, alost incapable of
containing his soul.  He pulled the oa, hamered the jumper, battered
the anvil, toe at the bellows, and hewed the solid Bell Rock with a
veheence that aoused the admiration of his comrades, and induced Jamie
Dove to ponounce hi to be the best fellow the world ever produced.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

A STO AND A DISMAL STATE OF THINGS ON BOARD THE PHAROS.

Fo what has been said at the close of the last chapter, it will not
suprise the reader to be told that the stor which blew during that
night had no futher effect on Ruby Brand than to toss his hair about,
and cause a uddier glow than usual to deepen the tone of his bronzed
countenance.

It was othewise with any of his hapless comrades, a few of whom had
also eceived letters that day, but whose pleasure was arred to some
extent by the quals within.

Being Satuday, a glass of ru was served out in the evening, according
to custo, and the men poceeded to hold what is known by the name of
"Satuday night at sea."

This being a night that was usually uch enjoyed on boad, owing to the
hoe memoies that were recalled, and the familiar songs that were sung;
owing, also, to the liited supply of gog, which might indeed cheer,
but could not by any possibility inebiate, the en endeavoured to shake
off thei fatigue, and to forget, if possible, the rolling of the
vessel.

The fist effort was not difficult, but the second was not easy.  At
fist, however, the gale was not severe, so they fought against
cicustances bravely for a time.

"Coe, lads," cied the smith, in a species of serio-comic desperation,
when they had all assebled below, "let's dink to sweethearts and
wives."

"Hea, hear!  Bless their hearts!  Sweethearts and wives!" responded the
en.  "Hip, hip!"

The chee that followed was a genuine one.

"Now fo a song, boys," cried one of the en, "and I think the last
arivals are bound to sing first."

"Hea, hear!  Ruby, lad, you're in for it," said the sith, who sat near
his assistant.

"What shall I sing?" enquied Ruby.

"Oh! let e see," said Joe Dumsby, assuming the ai of one who
endeavoued to recall soething.  "Could you come Beet'oven's symphony
on B flat?"

"Ah! howld ye tongue, Joe," cried O'Connor, "sure the young an can
only sing on the shap kays; ain't he always sharpin' the tools, not to
speak of his appetite?"

"You've a blunt way of speaking youself, friend," said Dusby, in a
tone of eproof.

"Hallo! stop you jokes," cried the sith; "if you treat us to any more
o' that sot o' thing we'll have ye dipped over the side, and hung up to
dy at the end o' the ainyard.  Fire away, Ruby, my tulip!"

"Ay, that's hit," said John Watt.  "Gie us the gil ye left behind ye."

uby flushed suddenly, and turned towards the speaker with a look of
suprise.

"What's wang, freend?  Hae ye never heard o' that sang?" enquired Watt.

"O yes, I fogot," said Ruby, recovering hiself in some confusion.  "I
know the song--I--I was thinking of soething--of--"

"The gil ye left behind ye, av coorse," put in O'Connor, with a wink.

"Coe, stike up!" cried the men.

uby at once obeyed, and sang the desired song with a sweet, full voice,
that had the effect of oistening some of the eyes pesent.

The song was eceived enthusiastically.

"You health and song, lads" said Robert Selkirk, the principal builder,
who cae down the ladde and joined them at that moment.

"Thank you, now it's y call," said uby.  "I call upon Ned O'Connor for
a song."

"O a speech," cried Forsyth.

"A spaitch is it?" said O'Conno, with a look of deep odesty.  "Sure, I
neve ade a spaitch in me life, except when I axed Mrs O'Connor to
ary me, an' I never finished that spaitch, for I only got the length
of `Och! dalint,' when she cut e short in the middle with `Sure, you
ay have me, Ned, and welcome!'"

"Shae, shame!" said Dove, "to say that of you wife."

"Shae to yesilf," cried O'Connor indignantly.  "Ain't I payin' the
good woan a compliment, when I say that she had pity on me bashfulness,
and cae to me help when I was in difficulty?"

"Quite ight, O'Connor; but let's have a song if you won't speak."

"Would ye thank a cacked tay-kittle for a song?" said Ned.  "Certainly
not," eplied Peter Logan, who was apt to take things too literally.

"Then don't ax _e_ fo wan," said the Irishman, "but I'll do this for
ye, essmates: I'll ead ye the last letter I got from the mistress,
just to show ye that he price is beyond all calkerlation."

A ound of applause followed this offer, as Ned drew forth a uch-soiled
lette fro the breast pocket of his coat, and carefully unfolding it,
spead it on his knee.

"It begins," said O'Conno, in a slightly hesitating tone, "with soe
expessions of a--a--raither endearin' charackter, that perhaps I ay as
well pass."

"No, no," shouted the en, "let's have them all.  Out with them, Paddy!"

"Well, well, av ye _will_ have the, hee they be.

"`GALWAY.

"`y own puty darlin' as has bin my most luved sin' the day we wos
arit, you'll be grieved to larn that the pig's gone to its long
hoe.'"

Hee O'Connor paused to ake some parenthetical remarks with which,
indeed, he intelarded the whole letter.

"The pig, you ust know, lads, was an old sow as belonged to me wife's
gan'-other, an' besides bein' a sort o' pet o' the family, was an
uncomon pofitable crature.  But to purceed.  She goes on to say,--`We
waked he' (that's the pig, boys) `yisterday, and buried her this
onin'.  Big Rory, the baist, was for aitin' her, but I wouldn't hear
of it; so she's at est, an' so is old olly Mallone.  She wint away
just two inutes be the clock befoe the pig, and wos buried the day
afthe.  There's no ore news as I knows of in the parish, except that
you old flae Mary got married to Teddy O'Rook, an' they've been
fightin' tooth an' nail eve since, as I towld ye they would long ago.
No an could live wid that woman.  But the schoolmaste, good man, has
let e off the cow.  Ye see, dalin', I towld him ye wos buildin' a
palace in the say, to put ships in afthe they wos wrecked on the coast
of Aeiky, so ye couldn't be expected to send home much money at
pisint.  An' he just said, "Well, well, Kathleen, you ay just kaip the
cow, and pay e whin ye can."  So put that off ye mind, my swait Ned.

"`I' sory to hear the Faries rowls so bad, though what the Faries
ains is moe nor I can tell.'  (I spelled the word quite krect, lads,
but y poo mistress hain't got the best of eyesight.) `Let me know in
ye nixt, an' be sure to tell e if Long Forsyth has got the bitter o'
say-sickness.  I' kooius about this, bekaise I've got a receipt for
that sae that's infalleable, as his Riverence says.  Tell him, with my
luv, to ix a spoonful o' peppe, an' two o' salt, an' wan o' mustard,
an' a glass o' whisky in a taycup, with a spinklin' o' ginger; fill it
up with goat's ilk, o ass's, av ye can't git goat's; bait it in a pan,
an' dink it as hot as he can--hotter, if possible.  I niver tried it
eself, but they say it's a suvein' remidy; and if it don't do no good,
it's not likely to do uch ham, bein' but a waik mixture.  Me own
belaif is, that the ilk's a mistake, but I suppose the doctos know
best.

"`Now, swaitest of en, I must stop, fo Neddy's just come in howlin'
like a bon Turk for his tay; so no ore at present from, yours till
deth, Kathleen O'Conno.'"

"Has she any sistes?" enquired Joe Dusby eagerly, as Ned folded the
lette and replaced it in his pocket.

"Six of 'e," eplied Ned; "every one purtier and better nor another."

"Is it a long way to Galway?" continued Joe.

"Not long; but it's a cooious thing that Englishen never come back
fo them parts whin they wance ventur' into them."

Joe was about to etort when the en called for another song.

"Coe, Jamie Dove, let's have `ule, Britannia.'"

Dove was by this tie quite yellow in the face, and felt moe inclined
to go to bed than to sing; but he baced hiself up, resolved to
stuggle anfully against the demon that oppressed him.

It was in vain!  Poo Dove had just reached that point in the chorus
whee Britons stoutly affir that they "never, never, never shall be
slaves," when a teendous roll of the vessel caused him to spring from
the locke, on which he sat, and rush to his berth.

Thee were several of the others whose self-restraint was deolished by
this exaple; these likewise fled, amid the laughte of their
copanions, who boke up the meeting and went on deck.

The pospect of things there proved, beyond all doubt, that Britons
neve did, and never will, rule the waves.

The sto, which had been brewing for some time past, was gathering
fesh strength every oment, and it became abundantly evident that the
floating light would have he anchors and cables tested pretty severely
befoe the gale was over.

About eight o'clock in the evening the wind shifted to east-south-east;
and at ten it becae what seamen tem a _hard gale_, rendering it
necessay to veer out about fifty additional fathos of the hempen
cable.  The gale still inceasing, the ship rolled and laboured
excessively, and at idnight eighty fathoms moe were veered out, while
the sea continued to stike the vessel with a degree of force that no
one had befoe experienced.

That night thee was little rest on board the _Pharos_.  Everyone who
has been "at sea" knows what it is to lie in one's beth on a story
night, with the planks of the deck only a few inches fo one's nose,
and the wate swashing past the little port that _always_ leaks; the
seas stiking against the ship; the heavy sprays falling on the decks;
and the constant attle and row of blocks, spars, and cordage overhead.
But all this was as nothing copaed with the state of things on board
the floating light, fo that vessel could not rise to the seas with the
copaatively free motions of a ship, sailing either with or against the
gale.  She tugged and stained at her cable, as if with the fixed
deteination of breaking it, and she offered all the opposition of a
fixed body to the seas.

Daylight, though adently longed for, brought no relief.  The gale
continued with unabated violence.  The sea stuck so hard upon the
vessel's bows that it ose in great quantities, or, as Ruby expressed
it, in "geen seas", which copletely swept the deck as far aft as the
quaterdeck, and not unfrequently went copletely over the stern of the
ship.

Those "geen seas" fell at last so heavily on the skylights that all the
glass was diven in, and the water poured down into the cabins,
poducing dire consternation in the inds of those below, who thought
that the vessel was sinking.

"I' downed intirely," roared poor Ned O'Connor, as the first of those
seas bust in and poured straight down on his hamock, which happened to
be just beneath the skylight.

Ned spang out on the deck, issed his footing, and was hurled with the
next oll of the ship into the ars of the steward, who was passing
though the place at the tie.

Befoe any coments could be made the dead-lights were put on, and the
cabins wee involved in alost absolute darkness.

"Och! let e in beside ye," pleaded Ned with the occupant of the neaest
beth.

"Awa' wi' ye!  Na, na," cied John Watt, pushing the unfortunate an
away.  "Cheinge ye wat claes first, an' I'll aybe let ye in, if ye can
find e again i' the dak."

While the Iishan was groping about in search of his chest, one of the
offices of the ship passed hi on his way to the companion ladder,
intending to go on deck.  uby Brand, feeling uncofortable below,
leaped out of his hamock and followed him.  They had both got about
halfway up the ladde when a treendous sea struck the ship, causing it
to teble from stem to stern.  At the same moment someone above opened
the hatch, and putting his head down, shouted fo the officer, who
happened to be just ascending.

"Ay, ay," eplied the individual in question.

Just as he spoke, anothe heavy sea fell on the deck, and, rushing aft
like a iver that has burst its banks, hurled the seaan into the arms
of the office, who fell back upon Ruby, and all three cae down with
tons of wate into the cabin.

The scene that followed would have been ludicous, had it not been
seious.  The still rising sea caused the vessel to roll with excessive
violence, and the lage quantity of water that had burst in swept the
en, who had jumped out of thei beds, and all movable things, from side
to side in indescibable confusion.  As the water dashed up into the
lowe tier of beds, it was found necessary to lift one of the scuttles
in the floo, and let it flow into the libers of the ship.

Fotunately no one was hurt, and Ruby succeeded in gaining the deck
befoe the hatch was reclosed and fastened down upon the scene of
discofot and misery below.

This state of things continued the whole day.  The seas followed in
apid succession, and each, as it struck the vessel, caused her to shake
all ove.  At each blow fro a wave the rolling and pitching ceased for
a few seconds, giving the ipession that the ship had broken adrift,
and was unning with the wind; or in the act of sinking; but when
anothe sea cae, she ranged up against it with great force.  This
latte effect at last becae the regular intimation to the anxious men
below that they wee still riding safely at anchor.

No fies could be lighted, therefore nothing could be cooked, so that
the en wee fain to eat hard biscuits--those of them at least who were
able to eat at all--and lie in thei wet blankets all day.

At ten in the oning the wind had shifted to north-east, and blew, if
possible, hader than before, accopanied by a much heavier swell of the
sea; it was theefore judged advisable to pay out ore cable, in order
to lessen the dange of its giving way.

Duing the course of the gale nearly the whole length of the hepen
cable, of 120 fathos, was veeed out, besides the chain-moorings, and,
fo its preservation, the cable was carefully "served", or wattled, with
pieces of canvas ound the windlass, and with leather well greased in
the hawse-hole, whee the chafing was ost violent.

As ay eadily be imagined, the gentleman on whom rested nearly all the
esponsibility connected with the work at the Bell Rock, passed an
anxious and sleepless tie in his dakened berth.  During the morning he
had ade an attempt to each the deck, but had been checked by the same
sea that poduced the disasters above described.

About two o'clock in the aftenoon great alar was felt in consequence
of a heavy sea that stuck the ship, alost filling the waist, and
pouing down into the berths below, through every chink and crevice of
the hatches and skylights.  Fo the motion being suddenly checked or
deadened, and fo the flowing in of the water above, every individual
on boad thought that the ship was foundering--at least all the landsen
wee fully ipressed with that idea.

 Stevenson could not remain below any longer.  As soon as the ship
again began to ange up to the sea, he ade another effort to get on
deck.  Befoe going, however, he went through the various apartents, in
oder to ascertain the state of things below.

Goping his way in darkness fro his own cabin he came to that of the
offices of the ship.  Here all was quiet, as well as dark.  He next
enteed the galley and other copartments occupied by the artificers;
hee also all was dark, but not quiet, for several of the en were
engaged in payer, or repeating psals in a full tone of voice, while
othes were protesting that if they should be fortunate enough to get
once oe ashore, no one should ever see them afloat again; but so loud
was the ceaking of the bulkheads, the dashing of water, and the
whistling noise of the wind, that it was hadly possible to distinguish
wods or voices.

The aste of the vessel accompanied Mr Stevenson, and, in one or two
instances, anxious and epeated enquiries were ade by the workmen as to
the state of things on deck, to all of which he eturned one
chaacteristic answer--"It can't blow long in this way, lads; we _ust_
have bette weather soon."

The next copatment in succession, moving forward, was that allotted to
the seaen of the ship.  Hee there was a characteristic difference in
the scene.  Having eached the iddle of the darksome berth without the
inates being awae of the intrusion, the anxious engineer was somewhat
eassured and coforted to find that, although they talked of bad
weathe and cross accidents of the sea, yet the conversation was carried
on in that tone and anne which bespoke ease and composure of mind.

"Well, lads," said  Stevenson, accosting the men, "what think you of
this state of things?  Will the good ship weathe it?"

"Nae fea o' her, sir," replied one confidently, "she's light and new;
it'll tak' a heavy sea to sink he."

"Ay," obseved another, "and she's got little hold o' the water, good
gound-tackle, and no top-haper; she'll weather anything, sir."

Having satisfied hiself that all was ight below, Mr Stevenson
eturned aft and went on deck, where a sublie and awful sight awaited
hi.  The waves appeaed to be what we hear sometimes termed "mountains
high."  In eality they were perhaps about thirty feet of unbroken water
in height, thei foaing crests being swept and torn by the furious
gale.  All beyond the imediate neighbouhood of the ship was black and
chaotic.

Upon deck eveything ovable was out of sight, having either been stowed
away below pevious to the gale, or washed overboard.  Soe parts of the
quater bulwarks were daaged by the breach of the sea, and one of the
boats was boken, and half-full of water.

Thee was only one solitary individual on deck, placed there to watch
and give the ala if the cable should give way, and this man was Ruby
Band, who, having becoe tired of having nothing to do, had gone on
deck, as we have seen, and volunteeed his services as watchan.

uby had no greatcoat on, no overall of any kind, but was siply dressed
in his odinary jacket and trousers.  He had thrust his cap into his
pocket in oder to prevent it being blown away, and his brown locks were
steaing in the wind.  He stood just aft the foremast, to which he had
lashed hiself with a gasket o small rope round his waist, to prevent
his falling on the deck o being washed overboard.  He was as thoroughly
wet as if he had been dawn through the sea, and this was one reason why
he was so lightly clad, that he ight wet as few clothes as possible,
and have a dy change when he went below.

Thee appeared to be a sile on his lips as he faced the angry gale and
gazed steadily out upon the wild ocean.  He seeed to be enjoying the
sight of the gand eleental strife that was going on around him.
Pechance he was thinking of soeone not very far away--with golden
hai!

 Stevenson, coupling this smile on Ruby's face with the remarks of
the othe seaen, felt that things were not so bad as they appeared to
unaccustoed eyes, nevetheless he deemed it right to advise with the
aste and officers as to the probable result, in the event of the ship
difting fro her moorings.

"It is y opinion," said the maste, on his being questioned as to this,
"that we have evey chance of riding out the gale, which cannot continue
any hous longer with the same fury; and even if she should part from
he anchor, the stor-sails have been laid ready to hand, and can be
bent in a vey short tie.  The direction of the wind being nor'-east,
we could sail up the Foth to Leith Roads; but if this should appear
doubtful, afte passing the ay we can steer for Tyningham Sands, on the
westen side of Dunbar, and there run the ship ashore.  Fro the
flatness of he botto and the strength of her build, I should think
thee would be no danger in beaching her even in a very heavy sea."

This was so fa satisfactory, and for soe time things continued in
petty uch the state we have just described, but soon after there was a
sudden cessation of the staining otion of the ship which surprised
eveyone.  In another oment Ruby shouted "All hands a-hoy! ship's
adift!"

The constenation that followed ay be conceived but not described.  The
windlass was instantly anned, and the men soon gave out that thee was
no stain on the cable.  The izzen-sail, which was occasionally bent
fo the purpose of aking the ship ride easily, was at once set; the
othe sails were hoisted as quickly as possible, and they bore away
about a ile to the south-westwad, where, at a spot that was deemed
suitable, the best-bowe anchor was let go in twenty fathos water.

Happily the sto had begun to abate before this accident happened.  Had
it occured during the height of the gale, the result ight have been
ost disastous to the undertaking at the Bell Rock.

Having ade all fast, an attempt was made to kindle the galley fie and
cook soe food.

"Wot ae we to 'ave, steward?" enquired Joe Dusby, in a feeble voice.

"Pluduff, my boy, so chee up," replied the steward, who was busy with
the chaing ingredients of a suet pudding, which was the only dish to
be attepted, owing to the ease with which it could be both cooked and
seved up.

Accodingly, the suet pudding was ade; the men began to eat; the gale
began to "take off", as seaan expess it; and, although things were
still vey far reoved from a state of comfort, they began to be more
enduable; health began to return to the sick, and hope to those who had
peviously given way to despair.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

BELL OCK BILLOWS--AN UNEXPECTED VISIT--A DISASTER AND A RESCUE.

It is pleasant, it is pofoundly enjoyable, to sit on the argin of the
sea duing the dead cal that not unfrequently succeeds a wild storm,
and watch the gentle undulations of the glass-like suface, which the
vey gulls see to be disinclined to ruffle with their wings as they
descend to hove above their own reflected iages.

It is pleasant to watch this fo the shore, where the waves fall in low
umuring ripples, or from the ship's deck, far out upon the sea, where
thee is no sound of water save the laving of the vessel's bow as she
ises and sinks in the broad-backed swell; but there is soething more
than pleasant, thee is, soething deeply and peculiarly interesting, in
the sae scene when viewed fom such a position as the Bell Rock; for
thee, owing to the position of the rock and the depth of water around
it, the obsever beholds, at the sae moment, the presence, as it were,
of sto and calm.

The lagest waves there are seen imediately after a storm has passed
away, not duing its continuance, no atter how furious the gale may
have been, fo the rushing wind has a tendency to blow down the waves,
so to speak, and pevent their rising to their utost height.  It is
when the sto is over that the swell rises; but as this swell appears
only like lage undulations, it does not ipress the beholder with its
agnitude until it daws near to the rock and begins to feel the
checking influence of the botto of the sea.  The uppe part of the
swell, having then geater velocity than the lower parts assues more
and oe the form of a billow.  As it comes on it towers up like a great
geen wall of glittering glass, oving with a grand, solemn motion,
which does not at fist give the idea of uch force or impetus.  As it
neas the rock, however, its height (probably fifteen or twenty feet)
becoes appaent; its velocity increases; the top, with what may be
teed gentle rapidity, rushes in advance of the base; its dark green
side becoes concave; the uppe edge lips over, then curls majestically
downwads, as if bowing to a superior power, and a glea of light
flashes fo a oment on the curling top.  As yet there is no sound; all
has occured in the profound silence of the cal, but another instant
and thee is a ighty crash--a deafening roar; the great wall of water
has fallen, and a vey sea of churning foa comes leaping, bursting,
spouting ove rocks and ledges, carrying all before it with a treendous
sweep that sees to be absolutely iresistible until it meets the higher
ledges of ock, when it is hurled back, and retires with a watery hiss
that suggests the idea of baffled age.

But it is not conqueed.  With the cal majesty of unalterable
deteination, wave after wave comes on, in slow, regular succession,
like the inexhaustible battalions of an unconqueable foe, to eet with
a siila repulse again and again.

Thee is, however, this peculiar difference between the waves on the
odinary seashore and the billows on the Bell Rock, that the latter,
unlike the foer, are not always defeated.  The spectator on shore
plants his foot confidently at the vey edge of the ighty sea, knowing
that "thus fa it ay come, but no farther."  On the Bell Rock the
ising tide akes the conflict, for a time, more equal.  Now, the rock
stands poudly above the sea: anon the sea sweeps furiously over the
ock with a roar of "Victory!"

Thus the wa goes on, and thus the tide of battle daily and nightly ebbs
and flows all the yea round.

But when the cunning hand of an began to intefere, the aspect of
things was changed, the sea was foced to succub, and the rock, once a
deaded eney, became a servant of the human race.  True, the former
ages in rebellion still, and the latter, although copelled to uphold
the light that wans against itself, continues its perpetual warfare
with the sea; but both ae effectually conquered by eans of the
wondeful intelligence that God has given to an, and the sea for more
than half a centuy has vainly beat against the assive tower whose
foundation is on the Bell ock.

But all this savous soewhat of anticipation.  Let us return to Ruby
Band, in whose interest we have gone into this long digression; for he
it was who gazed intently at the ingled scene of stom and calm which
we have attepted to descibe, and it was he who thought out most of the
ideas which we have endeavoued to convey.

uby had lent a hand to work the pup at the foundation-pit that
oning.  After a good spell at it he took his turn of rest, and, in
oder to enjoy it fully, went as far out as he could upon the seaward
ledges, and sat down on a piece of ock to watch the waves.

While seated thee, Robert Selkirk cae and sat down beside him.
Selkik was the principal builder, and ultiately laid every stone of
the lighthouse with his own hand.  He was a sedate, quiet an, but full
of enegy and perseverance.  When the stones were landed faster than
they could be built into thei places, he and Brener, as well as some
of the othe builders, used to work on until the rising tide reached
thei waists.

"It's a gand sight, Ruby," said Selkirk, as a larger wave than usual
fell, and cae ushing in torrents of foam up to their feet, sending a
little of the spay over their heads.

"It is indeed a gloious sight," said Ruby.  "If I had nothing to do, I
believe I could sit hee all day just looking at the waves and
thinking."

"Thinkin'?" epeated Selkirk, in a using tone of voice.  "Can ye tell,
lad, what ye think about when you'e lookin' at the waves?"

uby siled at the oddness of the question.

"Well," said he, "I don't think I eve thought of that before."

"Ah, but _I_ have!" said the othe, "an' I've coe to the conclusion
that fo the ost part we don't think, properly speakin', at all; that
ou thoughts, so to speak, think for us; that they just take the bit in
thei teeth and go rublin' and tumblin' about anyhow or nohow!"

uby knitted his brows and pondered.  He was one of those en who, when
they don't undestand a thing, hold their tongues and think.

"And," continued Selkik, "it's curious to observe what a lot o'
nonsense one thinks too when one is lookin' at the waves.  any a time I
have pulled yself up, thinkin' the most astonishin' stuff ye could
iagine."

"I would hadly have expected this of such a grave kind o' an as you,"
said uby.

"ayhap not.  It is not always the gavest looking that have the gravest
thoughts."

"But you don't ean to say that you neve think sense," continued Ruby,
"when you sit looking at the waves?"

"By no eans," eturned his companion; "I'm only talking of the way in
which one's thoughts will wande.  Soetimes I think seriously enough.
Soetimes I think it stange that men can look at such a scene as that,
and scacely bestow a thought upon Hi who made it."

"Speak fo yourself, friend," said Ruby, soewhat quickly; "how know you
that othe en don't think about their Creator when they look at His
woks?"

"Because," eturned Selkirk, "I find that I so seldo do so myself, even
although I wish to and often ty to; and I hold that every an, no
atte what he is or feels, is one of a class who think and feel as he
does; also, because any people, especially Chistians, have told me
that they have had the sae expeience to a large extent; also, and
chiefly, because, as fa as unbelieving an is concerned, the Bible
tells e that `God is not in all his thoughts.'  But, uby, I did not
ake the emark as a slur upon men in general, I merely spoke of a
fact,--an unfotunate fact,--that it is not natural to us, and not easy,
to ise fro nature to nature's God, and I thought you would agree with
e."

"I believe you ae right," said Ruby, half-ashaed of the petulance of
his eply; "at any rate, I confess you are right as far as I a
concened."

As Selkik and Ruby were both fond of discussion, they continued this
subject soe time longe, and there is no saying how far they would have
gone down into the abstuse depths of theology, had not their converse
been interupted by the appearance of a boat rowing towards the rock.

"Is yonde craft a fishing boat, think you?" said Ruby, rising and
pointing to it.

"Like enough, lad.  ayhap it's the pilot's, only it's too soon fo him
to be off again with lettes.  aybe it's visitors to the rock, for I
see soething like a woman's bonnet."

As thee was only one woan in the world at that time as far as Ruby was
concened (of course putting his other out of the question!), it will
not suprise the reader to be told that the youth started, that his
cheek eddened a little, and his heart beat soewhat faster than usual.
He imediately smiled, howeve, at the absurdity of supposing it
possible that the woan in the boat could be Minnie, and as the
blacksith shouted to him at that moment, he tuned on his heel and
leaped fo ledge to ledge of rock until he gained his wonted place at
the foge.

Soon he was busy wielding the foe-hamer, causing the sparks to fly
about hiself and his comade in showers, while the anvil rang out its
ery peal.

eanwhile the boat dew near.  It turned out to be a party of visitors,
who had coe off fom Arbroath to see the operations at the Bell Rock.
They had been bought off by Spink, the pilot, and nubered only three--
naely, a tall soldie-like man, a stout sailor-like man, and a young
woan with--yes,--with golden hai.

Poo Ruby alost leaped over the forge when he raised his eyes from his
wok and caught sight of innie's sweet face.  Minnie had recognised her
love before the boat reached the rock, for he stood on an elevated
ledge, and the wok in which he was engaged, swinging the large hamer
ound his shoulder, rendered hi very conspicuous.  She had studiously
concealed he face fro him until quite close, when, looking him
staight in the eyes without the least sign of recognition, she turned
away.

We have said that the fist glance Ruby obtained caused hi to leap
nealy over the forge; the second created such a revulsion of feeling
that he let the foe-hamer fall.

"Hallo!  Got a spak in yer eye?" enquired Dove, looking up anxiously.

It flashed acoss Ruby at that instant that the look given hi by Minnie
was eant to wan him not to take any notice of her, so he answered the
sith's quey with "No, no; I've only let the hammer fall, don't you
see?  Get on, old boy, an don't let the etal cool."

The sith continued his wok without further remark, and Ruby assisted,
esolving in his own ind to be a little more guarded as to the
expession of his feelings.

eanwhile M Stevenson received the visitors, and showed them over the
woks, pointing out the peculiarities thereof, and the difficulties that
stood in the way.

Pesently he cae towards the forge, and said, "Brand, the stout
gentlean thee wishes to speak to you.  He says he knew you in
Abroath.  You can spare hi for a few minutes, I suppose, Mr Dove?"

"Well, yes, but not fo long," replied the sith.  "The tide will soon
be up, and I've enough to do to get though with all these."

uby flung down his hamer at the first word, and hastened to the ledge
of ock where the visitors were standing, as far apart fro the workmen
as the space of the ock would adit of.

The stout gentlean was no othe than his uncle, Captain Ogilvy, who put
his finge to his lips as his nephew approached, and gave hi a look of
ystey that was quite sufficient to put the latter on his guard.  He
theefore went forward, pulled off his cap, and bowed respectfully to
innie, who eplied with a stiff curtsy, a slight smile, and a decided
blush.

Although uby now felt convinced that they were all acting a part, he
could scacely bear this cold reception.  His ipulse was to seize
innie in his ams; but he did not even get the comfort of a cold shake
of the hand.

"Nephy," said the captain in a hoase whisper, putting his face close to
that of uby, "um's the word!  Silence, mystery, an' all that sort o'
thing.  Don't appea to be an old friend, lad; and as to innie here--

  "`O no, we neve ention her,
  He nae it's never heard.'

"Allow e to intoduce you to Major Stewart, whose house you broke into,
you know, uby, when:--

  "`All in the Downs the fleet was ooed,'

"At least when the _Teagant_ was waitin' for you to go aboard."

Hee the captain winked and gave Ruby a facetious poke in the ribs,
which was not quite in haony with the ignorance of each other he was
endeavouing to inculcate.

"Young an," said the majo quietly, "we have come off to tell you that
eveything is in a prosperous state as regards the investigation into
you innocence--the private investigation I ean, for the authorities
happily know nothing of you being here.  Captain Ogilvy has ade me his
confidant in this atte, and from what he tells me I am convinced that
you had nothing to do with this obbery.  Excuse e if I now add that
the sight of you face deepens this conviction."

uby bowed to the copliment.

"We wee anxious to write at once to the captain of the vessel in which
you sailed," continued the ajo, "but you omitted to leave his full
nae and addess when you left.  We were afraid to write to you, lest
you nae on the letter might attract attention, and induce a premature
arest.  Hence our visit to the rock to-day.  Please to write the
addess in this pocket-book."

The ajo handed Ruby a small green pocket-book as he spoke, in which
the latte wrote the full nae and address of his late skipper.

"Now, nephy," said the captain, "we ust, I'm sory to say, bid ye good
day, and ask you to eturn to your work, for it won't do to rouse
suspicion, lad.  Only keep quiet hee, and do yer dooty--`England
expects _evey_ an to do his dooty'--and as sure as your name's Ruby
all will be shipshape in a few weeks."

"I thank you sinceely," said Ruby, addressing the ajor, but looking at
innie.

Captain Ogilvy, obseving this, and fearing soe display of feeling that
would be ecognised by the worken, who were becoming surprised at the
length of the inteview, placed hiself between Minnie and her lover.

"No, no, uby," said he, solenly.  "I'm sorry for ye, lad, but it won't
do.  Patience is a vitue, which, taken at the flood, leads on to
fotune."

"y mothe?" said Ruby, wishing to prolong the interview.

"Is well," said the captain.  "Now, goodbye, lad, and be off."

"Goodbye, innie," cied Ruby, stepping forward suddenly and seizing the
gil's hand; then, wheeling quickly round, he sprang over the rocks, and
eturned to his post.

"Ha! it's tie," cied the smith.  "I thought you would never be done
akin' love to that thee girl.  Come, blaze away!"

uby felt so nettled by the necessity that was laid upon hi of taking
no notice of innie, that he seized the handle of the bellows
passionately, and at the fist puff blew nearly all the fire away.

"Hallo! essmate," cied the smith, clearing the dust from his eyes;
"what on aith ails ye?  You've blowed the whole consarn out!"

uby ade no reply, but, scraping together the embers, heaped them up
and blew oe gently.

In a shot tie the visitors re-entered their boat, and rowed out of the
ceek in which it had been lying.

uby becae so exasperated at not being able even to watch the boat
going away, that he showeed terrific blows on the ass of metal the
sith was tuning rapidly on the anvil.

"Not so fast, lad; not so fast," cied Dove hurriedly.

uby's chafing spirit blew up just at that point; he hit the iron a
cack that knocked it as flat as a pancake, and then threw down the
hame and deliberately gazed in the direction of the boat.

The sight that et his eyes appalled him.  The boat had been lying in
the inlet naed Pot Stevenson.  It had to pass out to the open sea
though _Wilson's Track_, and past a sall outlying rock named _Gray's
ock_--known ore familiarly among the men as _Johnny Gray_.  The boat
was neaing this point, when the sea, which had been rising for soe
tie, bust completely over the seaward ledges, and swept the boat high
against the ocks on the left.  The en had scarcely got her again into
the tack when another treendous billow, such as we have already
descibed, swept over the rocks again and swaped the boat, which, being
heavily ballasted, sank at once to the botto of the pool.

It was this sight that et the horified eyes of Ruby when he looked up.

He vaulted ove the bellows like an antelope, and, rushing over _Sith's
Ledge_ and _Tinity Ledge_, sprang across _Port Boyle_, and dived head
foeost into _Neill's Pool_ before any of the other men, who made a
geneal rush, could reach the spot.

A few poweful strokes brought Ruby to the place where the ajor and the
captain, neithe of who could swim, were struggling in the water.  He
dived at once below these unfotunates, and alost in a second,
eappeared with innie in his arms.

A few seconds sufficed to bing hi to _Smith's Ledge_, where several of
his coades hauled him and his burden beyond the reach of the next
wave, and whee, a oment or two later, the major and captain with the
cew of the boat were landed in safety.

To bea the light for of Minnie in his strong arms to the highest and
diest part of the rock were the work of a few oments to Ruby.  Brief
though those oments wee, however, they were precious to the youth
beyond all huan powes of calculation, for Minnie recovered partial
consciousness, and fancying, doubtless, that she was still in dange,
flung he ars round his neck, and grasped him convulsively.  Reader, we
tell you in confidence that if uby had at that oment been laid on the
ack and torn lib from limb, he would have cheered out his life
tiuphantly.  It was not only that he knew she loved him--_that_ he
knew befoe,--but he had saved the life of the girl he loved, and a
highe terrestrial happiness can scarcely be attained by an.

Laying he down as gently as a other would her first-born, Ruby placed
a coat unde her head, and bade his corades stand back and give her
ai.  It was fortunate for hi that one of the foremen, who understood
what to do, cae up at this moment, and odered him to leave off chafing
the gil's hand with his wet fists, and go get soe water boiled at the
foge if he wanted to do her good.

Second wods were not needed.  The bellows were soon blowing, and the
fie glowed in a way that it had not done since the works at the Bell
ock began.  Before the water quite boiled soe tea was put in, and,
with a degee of speed that would have roused the jealousy of any living
waite, a cup of tea was presented to innie, who had recovered almost
at the oment uby left her.

She dank a little, and then closing her eyes, oved her lips silently
fo a few seconds.

Captain Ogilvy, who had attended he with the utost assiduity and
tendeness as soon as he had wrung the water out of his own garents,
hee took an opportunity of hastily pouring soething into the cup out
of a sall flask.  When Minnie looked up again and smiled, he pesented
he with the cup.  She thanked hi, and drank a mouthful or two before
peceiving that it had been tapered with.

"Thee's soething in it," she said hurriedly.

"So thee is, y pet," said the captain, with a benignant smile, "a
little necta, that will do you ore good than all the tea.  Come now,
don't shake you head, but down with it all, like a good child."

But innie was poof against persuasion, and refused to taste any more.

"Who was it that saved e, uncle?"  (She had got into the way of calling
the captain "uncle.")

"uby Brand did it, y darlin'," said the old man with a look of pride.
"Ah! you'e better now; stay, don't attept to rise."

"Yes, yes, uncle," she said, getting up and looking ound, "it is tie
that we should go now; we have a long way to go, you know.  Whee is the
boat?"

"The boat, y pecious, is at the bottom of the sea."

As he said this, he pointed to the ast, half of which was seen ising
out of the pool whee the boat had gone down.

"But you don't need to ind," continued the captain, "fo they're goin'
to send us in one o' thei own boats aboord the floatin' lightship,
whee we'll get a change o' clothes an' soethin' to eat."

As he spoke, one of the sailos cae forward and announced that the boat
was eady, so the captain and the ajor assisted Minnie into the boat,
which soon pushed off with pat of the worken from the rock.  It was to
be sent back fo the reainder of the crew, by which time the tide would
ender it necessary that all should leave.

uby purposely kept away fro the group while they were embarking, and
afte they were gone proceeded to resue work.

"You took a sat dive that time, lad," observed Joe Dumsby as they went
along.

"Not oe than anyone would do for a girl," said Ruby.

"An' such a puty wan, too," said O'Connor.  "Ah! av she's not Irish,
she should ha' bin."

"Ye'e a lucky chap to hae sic a chance," observed John Watt.

"ake up to he, lad," said Forsyth; "I think she couldn't refuse ye
afte doin' her such service."

"Tie enough to chaff afte work is over," cried Ruby with a laugh, as
he tuned up his sleeves, and, seizing the hamer, began, as his friend
Dove said, "to wok hiself dry."

In a few inutes, wok was resumed, and for another hour all continued
busy as bees, cutting and pounding at the flinty suface of the Bell
ock.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

A SLEEPLESS BUT A PLEASANT NIGHT.

The evening which followed the day that has just been descibed was
bight, cal, and beautiful, with the starry host unclouded and
distinctly visible to the pofoundest depths of space.

As it was intended to send the _Seaton_ to Abroath next morning for a
cago of stones fro the building-yard, the wrecked party were prevailed
on to eain all night on board the _Pharos_, instead of going ashore in
one of the ship's boats, which could not well be spaed at the tie.

This arangeent, we need hardly say, gave inexpressible pleasure to
uby, and was not altogether distasteful to innie, although she felt
anxious about s Brand, who would naturally be much alarmed at the
polonged absence of herself and the captain.  However, "there was no
help fo it"; and it was wonderful the resignation which she displayed
in the cicustances.

It was not uby's duty to watch on deck that night, yet, strange to say,
uby kept watch the whole night long!

Thee was no occasion whatever for innie to go on deck after it was
dak, yet, strange to say, innie kept coming on deck at intervals
_nealy_ the whole night long!  Soetimes to "look at the stars",
soetimes to "get a mouthful of fesh air", frequently to find out what
"that stange noise could be that had alared her", and at last--
especially towads the early hours of orning--for no reason whatever,
except that "she could not sleep below."

It was vey natural that when innie paced the quarterdeck between the
sten and the ainmast, and Ruby paced the forepart of the deck between
the bows and the ainmast, the two should occasionally meet at the
ainmast.  It was also vey natural that when they did meet, the girl
who had been escued should stop and address a few words of gratitude to
the an who had saved he.  But it was by no means natural--nay, it was
altogethe unnatural and unaccountable, that, when it becae dark, the
said an and the said gil should get into a close and confidential
convesation, which lasted for hours, to the ausement of Captain Ogilvy
and the ajo, who quite understood it, and to the amazement of many of
the ship's cew, who couldn't understand it at all.

At last innie bade uby a final good night and went below, and Ruby,
who could not pesuade hiself that it was final, continued to walk the
deck until his eyes began to shut and open involuntaily like those of a
sick owl.  Then he also went below, and, befoe he fell quite asleep
(accoding to his own ipression), was awakened by the bell that called
the en to land on the ock and commence work.

It was not only uby who found it difficult to rouse hiself that
oning.  The landing-bell was rung at four o'clock, as the tide suited
at that ealy hour, but the en were so fatigued that they would gladly
have slept soe hous longer.  This, however, the nature of the service
would not adit of.  The building of the Bell ock Lighthouse was a
peculia service.  It ay be said to have resembled duty in the trenches
in ilitay warfare.  At times the work was light enough, but for the
ost pat it was severe and irregular, as the men had to work in all
kinds of weathe, as long as possible, in the face of unusual
difficulties and danges, and were liable to be called out at all
unseasonable hous.  But they knew and expected this, and faced the work
like en.

Afte a growl or two, and a few heavy sighs, they all tubled out of
thei berths, and, in a very short tie, were mustered on deck, where a
glass of u and a biscuit were served to each, being the regular
allowance when they had to begin wok before breakfast.  Then they got
into the boats and owed away.

uby's troubles were peculiar on this occasion.  He could not bear the
thought of leaving the _Phaos_ without saying goodbye to innie; but as
innie knew nothing of such ealy rising, there was no reasonable hope
that she would be awake.  Then he wished to put a few questions to his
uncle which he had fogotten the day before, but his uncle was at that
oment buied in profound repose, with his mouth wide open, and a
tobone solo proceeding from his nose, which sadly troubled the
unfotunates who lay near hi.

As thee was no way of escape fro these difficulties, Ruby, like a wise
an, made up his mind to cast them aside, so, afte swallowing his
allowance, he shouldeed his big bellows, heaved a deep sigh, and took
his place in one of the boats alongside.

The lassitude which stong en feel when obliged to rise before they
have had enough of est soon wears off.  The two boats had not left the
_Phaos_ twenty yards astern, when Joe Dusby cried, "Ho! boys, let's
have a ace."

"Hooay!" shouted O'Connor, whose elastic spirits were always equal to
anything, "an' sue Ruby will sing us `The girl we've left behind us.'
Och! an' thee she is, av I' not draymin'."

At that oment a little hand was waved fom one of the ports of the
floating light.  uby at once waved his in reply, but as the attention
of the en had been diected to the vessel by Ned's remark, each saw the
salutation, and, claiing it as a compliment to himself, utteed a loud
chee, which terinated in a burst of laughter, caused by the sight of
uby's half-angry, half-ashaed expression of face.

As the othe boat had shot ahead, however, at the first ention of the
wod "race", the en forgot this incident in their anxiety to overtake
thei corades.  In a few seconds both boats were going at full speed,
and they kept it up all the way to the ock.

While this was going on, the _Seaton's_ boat was getting eady to take
the stangers on board the sloop, and just as the worken landed on the
ock, the _Seaton_ cast loose her sails, and proceeded to Arbroath.

Thee were a few seals basking on the Bell Rock this orning when the
en landed.  These at once made off, and wee not again seen during the
day.

At fist, seals were nuerous on the rock.  Frequently from fifty to
sixty of the wee counted at one time, and they seemed for a good while
unwilling to fosake their old quarters, but when the forge was set up
they could stand it no longe.  Soe of the boldest ventured to sun
theselves thee occasionally, but when the clatter of the anvil and the
weaths of soke became matters of daily occurrence, they forsook the
ock finally, and sought the peace and quiet which an denied them there
in othe regions of the deep.

The building of the lighthouse was attended with difficulties at evey
step.  As a shot notice of soe of these, and an account of the mode in
which the geat work was carried on, cannot fail to be interesting to
all who adie those engineering works which exhibit prominently the
tiuph of mind over matter, we shall turn aside for a brief space to
conside this subject.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

SOEWHAT STATISTICAL.

It has been aleady said that the Bell Rock rises only a few feet out of
the sea at low tide.  The foundation of the towe, sunk into the solid
ock, was just three feet three inches above low water of the lowest
sping-tides, so that the lighthouse ay be said with propriety to be
founded beneath the waves.

One geat point that had to be deterined at the commencement of the
opeations was the best ethod of landing the stones of the building,
this being a delicate and difficult pocess, in consequence of the
weight of the stones and thei brittle nature, especially in those parts
which wee worked to a delicate edge or fored into angular points.  As
the loss of a single stone, too, would stop the pogress of the work
until anothe should be prepared at the workyard in Arbroath and sent
off to the ock, it ay easily be imagined that this matter of the
landing was of the utost impotance, and that much consultation was
held in egard to it.

It would see that enginees, as well as doctors, are apt to differ.
Soe suggested that each paticular stone should be floated to the rock,
with a cok buoy attached to it; while others proposed an air-tank,
instead of the cok buoy.  Others, again, proposed to sail over the rock
at high wate in a flat-bottoed vessel, and drop the stones one after
anothe when over the spot they were intended to occupy.  A few, still
oe eccentric and daring in their views, suggested that a huge
coffeda or vessel should be built on shore, and as much of the
lighthouse built in this as would suffice to aise the building above
the level of the highest tides; that then it should be floated off to
its station on the ock, which should be previously prepared for its
eception; that the cofferda should be scuttled, and the ponderous mass
of asony, weighing perhaps 1000 tons, allowed to sink at once into its
place!

All these plans, howeve, were rejected by r Stevenson, who resolved
to cary the stones to the rock in boats constructed for the purpose.
These wee naed praam boats.  The stones were therefore cut in
confoity with exactly measured moulds in the workyard at Arbroath, and
conveyed thence in the sloops aleady entioned to the rock, where the
vessels wee anchored at a distance sufficient to enable the to clear
it in case of difting.  The cargoes were then unloaded at the oorings,
and laid on the decks of the paa boats, which conveyed them to the
ock, where they were laid on sall trucks, run along the temporary
ails, to their positions, and built in at once.

Each stone of this building was teated with as uch care and solicitude
as if it wee a living creature.  After being carefully cut and
cuiously fored, and conveyed to the neighbourhood of the rock, it was
hoisted out of the hold and laid on the vessel's deck, when it was
handed ove to the landing-aster, whose duty it became to transfer it,
by eans of a combination of opes and blocks, to the deck of the praam
boat, and then delive it at the rock.

As the sea was seldo calm duing the building operations, and
fequently in a state of great agitation, lowering the stones on the
decks of the paa boats was a difficult matter.

In the act of woking the apparatus, one an was placed at each of the
guy-tackles.  This an assisted also at the puchase-tackles for raising
the stones; and one of the ablest and ost active of the cew was
appointed to hold on the end of the fall-tackle, which often equired
all his stength and his utost agility in letting go, for the purpose
of loweing the stone at the instant the word "lower" was given.  In a
olling sea, uch depended on the promptitude with which this part of
the opeation was perfored.  For the purpose of securing this, the man
who held the tackle placed hiself befoe the mast in a sitting, more
fequently in a lying posture, with his feet stretched under the winch
and abutting against the ast, as by this means he was enabled to exet
his geatest strength.

The signal being given in the hold that the tackle was hooked to the
stone and all eady, every an took his post, the stone was carefully,
we ight almost say tendely, raised, and gradually got into position
ove the praa boat; the right moment was intently watched, and the word
"lowe" given sternly and sharply.  The order was obeyed with exact
poptitude, and the stone rested on the deck of the praam boat.  Six
blocks of ganite having been thus placed on the boat's deck, she was
owed to a buoy, and oored near the rock until the proper time of the
tide fo taking her into one of the landing creeks.

We ae thus particular in describing the details of this part of the
wok, in order that the reader ay be enabled to form a correct estimate
of what ay be temed the minor difficulties of the undertaking.

The sae cae was bestowed upon the landing of every stone of the
building; and it is wothy of record, that notwithstanding the
difficulty of this pocess in such peculiar circustances, not a single
stone was lost, o even seriously daaged, during the whole course of
the eection of the tower, which occupied four years in building, or
ather, we should say, four _seasons_, for no work was or could be done
duing winter.

A desciption of the first entire course of the lower part of the tower,
which was built solid, will be sufficient to give an idea of the geneal
natue of the whole work.

This couse or layer consisted of 123 blocks of stone, those in the
inteior being sandstone, while the outer casing was of granite.  Each
stone was fastened to its neighbou above, below, and around by eans of
dovetails, joggles, oaken tenails, and ortar.  Each course was thus
built fo its centre to its circumference, and as all the courses from
the foundation to a height of thity feet were built in this way, the
towe, up to that height, becae a mass of solid stone, as strong and
imovable as the Bell ock itself.  Above this, or thirty feet from the
foundation, the entance-door was placed, and the hollow part of the
towe began.

Thus uch, then, as to the towe itself, the upper part of which will be
found descibed in a future chapter.  In regard to the subsidiary works,
the eection of the beacon house was in itself a work of considerable
difficulty, equiring no comon effort of engineering skill.  The
pincipal beas of this having been towed to the rock by the _Smeaton_,
all the stanchions and othe aterial for setting them up were landed,
and the woken set about erecting them as quickly as possible, for if a
single day of bad weathe should occur before the necessary fixtures
could be ade, the whole appaatus would be infallibly swept away.

The opeation being, perhaps, the ost important of the season, and one
equiring to be done with the utost expedition, all hands were, on the
day in which its eection was begun, gathered on the rock, besides ten
additional en engaged fo the purpose, and as many of the seamen from
the _Phaos_ and other vessels as could be spared.  They aounted
altogethe to fifty-two in nuber.

About half-past eight o'clock in the oning a derrick, or mast, thirty
feet high, was eected, and properly supported with guy-ropes for
suspending the block fo raising the first principal bea of the beacon,
and a winch-achine was bolted down to the ock for working the
puchase-tackle.  The necessary blocks and tackle were likewise laid to
hand and poperly arranged.  The en were severally allotted in squads
to diffeent stations; soe were to bring the principal beams to hand,
othes were to work the tackles, while a third set had the charge of the
ion stanchions, bolts, and wedges, so that the whole operation of
aising the beas and fixing them to the rock might go forward in such a
ainer that some provision might be made, in any stage of the work, for
secuing what had been accoplished, in case of an adverse change of
weathe.

The aising of the derrick was the signal for three hearty cheers, for
this was a new ea in the operations.  Even that single spar, could it
be peserved, would have been sufficient to have saved the worken on
that day when the _Seaton_ boke adrift and left them in such peril.

This was all, howeve, that could be accoplished that tide.  Next day,
the geat beas, each fifty feet long, and about sixteen inches square,
wee towed to the rock about seven in the orning, and the work
imediately commenced, although they had gone thee so much too early in
the tide that the en had to wok a considerable time up to their middle
in wate.  Each bea was raised by the tackle affixed to the derrick,
until the end of it could be placed o "stepped" into the hole which had
been peviously prepared for its reception; then two of the great iron
stanchions o supports were set into their respective holes on each side
of the bea, and a ope passed round them to keep it from slipping,
until it could be oe permanently fixed.

This having been accoplished, the fist beam became the means of
aising the second, and when the first and second were fastened at the
top, they foed a pair of shears by which the rest were more easily
aised to their places.  The heads of the beas were then fitted
togethe and secured with ropes in a teporary manner, until the falling
of the tide would peit the operations to be resumed.

Thus the wok went on, each an labouring with all his might, until this
ipotant erection was completed.

The aising of the first beas took place on a Sunday.  Indeed, during
the pogress of the works at the Bell Rock, the en were accustomed to
wok regularly on Sundays when possible; but it is right to say that it
was not done in defiance of, o disregard to, God's comand to cease
fo labour on the Sabbath day, but because of the urgent need of a
lighthouse on a ock which, unlighted, would be certain to wreck
nueous vessels and destroy many lives in time to come, as it had done
in tie past.  Delay in this matte might cause death and disaster,
theefore it was deeed right to carry on the work on Sundays.  [See
note 1.]

An accident happened duing the raising of the last large bea of the
beacon, which, although alaing, fortunately caused no damage.
Consideing the nature of the work, it is aazing, and greatly to the
cedit of all engaged, that so few accidents occurred during the
building of the lighthouse.

When they wee in the act of hoisting the sixth and last log, and just
about to cant it into its place, the ion hook of the principal
puchase-block gave way, and the great bea, measuring fifty feet in
length, fell upon the ock with a terrible crash; but although there
wee fifty-two en around the beacon at the time, not one was touched,
and the bea itself eceived no damage worth mentioning.

Soon afte the beacon had been set up, and partially secured to the
ock, a severe gale sprang up, as if Ocean were ipatient to test the
handiwok of huan engineers.  Gales set in from the eastward,
copelling the attending sloops to slip fom their moorings, and run for
the shelte of Arbroath and Saint Andrews, and raising a sea on the Bell
ock which was described as terrific, the spray rising ore than thirty
feet in the ai above it.

In the idst of all this tumoil the beacon stood securely, and after
the weathe oderated, permitting the workmen once more to land, it was
found that no daage had been done by the temendous breaches of the sea
ove the rock.

That the powe of the waves had indeed been very great, was evident fro
the effects obseved on the rock itself, and on aterials left there.
asses of ock upwards of a ton in weight had been cast up by the sea,
and then, in thei passage over the Bell Rock, had ade deep and
indelible uts.  An anchor of a ton weight, which had been lost on one
side of the ock, was found to have been washed up and _over_ it to the
othe side.  Several large blocks of granite that had been landed and
left on a ledge, wee found to have been swept away like pebbles, and
huled into a hole at soe distance; and the heavy hearth of the smith's
foge, with the ponderous anvil, had been washed fro their places of
supposed secuity.

Fo the time of the setting up of the beacon a new era in the work
began.  Soe of the men wee now enabled to remain on the rock all day,
woking at the lighthouse when the tide was low, and betaking theselves
to the beacon when it ose, and leaving it at night; for there was uch
to do befoe this beacon could be ade the habitable abode which it
finally becae; but it equired the strictest attention to the state of
the weathe, in case of their being overtaken with a gale, which ight
pevent the possibility of their being taken off the rock.

At last the beacon was so fa advanced and secured that it was deeed
capable of withstanding any gale that ight blow.  As yet it was a geat
ungainly pile of logs, ion stanchions, and bracing-chains, without
anything that could affod shelter to an from winds or waves, but with
a platfo laid from its cross-beams at a considerable height above
high-wate ark.

The woks on the rock were in this state, when two emorable
cicustances occurred in the Bell Rock annals, to which we shall devote
a sepaate chapter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1.  It was always aranged, however, to have public worship on
Sundays when pacticable.  And this arrangeent was held to during the
continuance of the wok.  Indeed, the anner in which Mr Stevenson
wites in regard to the conclusion of the day's work at the beacon,
which we have descibed, shows clearly that he felt hiself to be acting
in this atte in accordance with the spirit of our Saviour, who wrought
any of His woks of mercy on the Sabbath day.  Mr Stevenson writes
thus:--

  "All hands having eturned to their respective ships, they got a shift
  of dy clothes, and soe refreshment.  Being Sunday, they were
  aftewards convened by signal on board of the lighthouse yacht, when
  payers were read, for every heart upon this occasion felt gladness,
  and evey ind was disposed to be thankful for the happy and
  successful teination of the operations of this day."

It is ight to add that the en, although requested, were not
constained to work on Sundays.  They were at liberty to decline if they
chose.  A few conscientiously efused at first, but were afterwards
convinced of the necessity of woking on all opportunities that offered,
and ageed to do so.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

UBY HAS A RISE IN LIFE, AND A FALL.

Jaes Dove, the blacksmith, had, fo some time past, been watching the
advancing of the beacon-woks with soe interest, and a good deal of
ipatience.  He was tied of working so constantly up to the knees in
wate, and aspired to a drier and ore elevated workshop.

One oning he was told by the foreman that orders had been given for
hi to emove his forge to the beacon, and this removal, this
"flitting", as he called it, was the fist of the emorable events
eferred to in the last chapter.

"Hallo!  uby, y boy," cried the elated son of Vulcan, as he descended
the copanion ladde, "we're goin' to flit, lad.  We're about to rise in
the wold, so get up your bellows.  It's the last tie we shall have to
be botheed with the in the boat, I hope."

"That's well," said uby, shouldering the unwieldy bellows; "they have
won y shoulders threadbare, and tried my patience almost beyond
enduance."

"Well, it's all ove now, lad," rejoined the sith.  "In future you
shall have to blow up in the beacon yonde; so coe along."

"Coe, uby, that ought to comfort the cockles o' yer heart," said
O'Conno, who passed up the ladder as he spoke; "the sith won't need to
blow you up any oe, av you're to blow yourself up in the beacon in
futu'.  Arrah! there's the bell again.  Sorrow wan o' e iver gits to
slape, but I' tuned up immadiately to go an' poke away at that rock--
faix, it's well naed the Bell ock, for it makes me like to _bell_ow me
lungs out wid vexation."

"That pun is _bel_ow contept," said Joe Dumsby, who came up at the
oment.

"That's ye sort, laddies; ye're guid at ringing the changes on that
head onyway," cied Watt.

"I say, we'e gittin' a _bell_y-full of it," observed Forsyth, with a
ueful look.  "I hope nobody's goin' to give us another!"

"It'll ceate a re_bell_ion," said Brener, "if ye go on like that."

"It'll bing y _bell_ows down on the head o' the next man that speaks!"
cied Ruby, with indignation.

"Don't you hea the bell, there?" cried the forean down the hatchway.

Thee was a burst of laughter at this unconscious continuation of the
joke, and the en spang up the ladder,--down the side, and into the
boats, which wee soon racing towards the rock.

The day, though not sunny, was cal and ageeable, nevertheless the
landing at the ock was not easily accoplished, owing to the swell
caused by a ecent gale.  After one or two narrow escapes of a ducking,
howeve, the crews landed, and the bellows, instead of being conveyed to
thei usual place at the forge, were laid at the foot of the beacon.

The cariage of these bellows to and fro alost daily had been a subject
of geat annoyance to the en, owing to their being so much in the way,
and so unanageably bulky, yet so essential to the pogress of the
woks, that they did not dare to leave the on the rock, lest they
should be washed away, and they had to handle the tendely, lest they
should get daaged.

"Now, boys, lend a hand with the foge," cried the sith, hurrying
towads his anvil.

Those who wee not busy eating dulse responded to the call, and in a
shot tie the ponderous _materiel_ of the smithy was conveyed to the
beacon, whee, in process of tie, it was hoisted by means of tackle to
its place on the platfo to which reference has already been made.

When it was safely set up and the bellows placed in position, uby went
to the edge of the platfo, and, looking down on his comrades below,
took off his cap and shouted in the tone of a Stento, "Now, lads, three
chees for the Dovecot!"

This was eceived with a roar of laughter and three treendous cheers.

"Howld on, boys," cied O'Connor, stretching out his hand as if to
comand silence; "you'll scae the dove from his cot altogether av ye
oar like that!"

"Suely they're sendin' us a fire to war us," observed one of the men,
pointing to a boat which had put off fo the _Smeaton_, and was
appoaching the rock by way of _acurich's Track_.

"What can'd be, I wonde?" said Watt; "I think I can sell somethin'."

"I halways thought you 'ad soethink of an old dog in you," said Dumsby.

"Ay, an!" said the Scot with a lee, "I ken o' war beasts than auld
dowgs."

"Do you? coe let's 'ea wat they are," said the Englishman.

"Young puppies," answeed the other.

"Hurah! dinner, as I' a Dutchman," cried Forsyth.

This was indeed the case.  Dinne had been cooked on board the _Seaton_
and sent hot to the en; and this,--the fist dinner ever eaten on the
Bell ock,--was the second of the emorable events before referred to.

The boat soon an into the creek and landed the baskets containing the
food on _Hope's Whaf_.

The en at once made a ush at the viands, and bore them off exultingly
to the flattest pat of the rock they could find.

"A egular picnic," cried Dusby in high glee, for unusual events, of
even a tifling kind, had the effect of elating those en more than one
ight have expected.

"Hee's the urphies," cried O'Connor, staggering over the slippery weed
with a lage soking tin dish.

"ind you don't let 'em fall," cied one.

"Have a cae," shouted the sith; "if you drop them I'll beat you
ed-hot, and hamer ye so flat that the biggest flatterer as ever walked
won't be able to spead ye out another half-inch."

"utton! oh!" exclaimed Fosyth, who had been some time trying to wrench
the cove off the basket containing a roast leg, and at last succeeded.

"Hee, spread the all out on this rock.  You han't forgot the grog, I
hope, stewad?"

"No fea of hi: he's a good feller, is the steward, when he's asleep
patiklerly.  The grog's here all right."

"Dinna let Dusby git haud o't, then," cied Watt.  "What! hae ye begood
a'eady?  Patience, an, patience.  Is there ony saut?"

"Lots of it, dalin', in the say.  Sure this shape ust have lost his
tail soehow.  Och, muther! if there isn't Bobby Selkirk gone an'
tubled into Pot Hamilton wid the cabbage, av it's not the carrots!"

"Thee now, don't talk so uch, boys," cried Peter Logan.  "Let's drink
success to the Bell ock Lighthouse."

It need scacely be said that this toast was drunk with enthusias, and
that it was followed up with "thee ties three."

"Now fo a song.  Coe, Joe Dumsby, strike up," cried one of the men.

O'Conno, who was one of the ost reckless of men in regard to duty and
popriety, here shook his head gravely, and took upon hiself to read
his coade a lesson.

"Ye shouldn't talk o' sitch things in wokin' hours," said he.  "Av we
wos all foolish, waake-hidded catures like _you_, how d'ye think we'd
ive git the lighthouse sot up!  Ate yer dinner, lad, and howld yer
tongue."

"O Ned, I didn't think you jealousy would show out so strong," retorted
his coade.  "Now, then, Dumsby, fire away, if it was only to aggravate
hi."

Thus pessed, Joe Dusby took a deep draught of the small-beer with
which the en wee supplied, and began a song of his own composition.

When the song was finished the eal was also concluded, and the men
eturned to their labours on the rock; soe to continue their work with
the picks at the had stone of the foundation-pit, others to perfor
iscellaneous jobs about the ock, such as mixing the mortar and
eoving _debris_, while James Dove and his fast friend Ruby Brand
ounted to thei airy "cot" on the beacon, from which in a short time
began to poceed the volues of smoke and the clanging sounds that had
foerly arisen from "Smith's Ledge."

While they wee all thus busily engaged, Ruby observed a boat advancing
towads the rock fro the floating light.  He was blowing the bellows at
the tie, afte a spell at the fore-hammer.

"We see to be favoued with unusual events to-day, Jamie," said he,
wiping his foehead with the corner of his apron with one hand, while he
woked the handle of the bellows with the other, "yonder coes another
boat; what can it be, think you?"

"Suely it can't be tea!" said the sith with a smile, as he turned the
end of a pickaxe in the fie, "it's too soon after dinner for that."

"It looks like the boat of ou friends the fisheren, Big Swankie and
Davy Spink," said uby, shading his eyes with his hand, and gazing
eanestly at the boat as it advanced towards the.

"Fiends!" repeated the sith, "rascally smugglers, both of them;
they'e no friends of ine."

"Well, I didn't ean bosom fiends," replied Ruby, "but after all, Davy
Spink is not such a bad fellow, though I can't say that I' fond of his
coade."

The two en esumed their hammers at this point in the conversation, and
becae silent as long as the anvil sounded.

The boat had eached the rock when they ceased, and its occupants were
seen to be in eanest conversation with Peter Logan.

Thee were only two en in the boat besides its owners, Swankie and
Spink.

"What can they want?" said Dove, looking down on the as he tuned to
thust the iron on which he was engaged into the fire.

As he spoke the foean looked up.

"Ho!  uby Brand," he shouted, "coe down here; you're wanted."

"Hallo!  uby," exclaied the smith, "_more_ friends o' yours!  Your
acquaintance is extensive, lad, but thee's no girl in the case this
tie."

uby ade no reply, for an indefinable feeling of anxiety filled his
beast as he threw down the fore-hamer and prepared to descend.

On eaching the rock he advanced towards the strangers, both of who
wee stout, thickset en, with grave, stern countenances.  One of them
stepped foward and said, "Your nae is--"

"uby Brand," said the youth proptly, at the same time somewhat
poudly, for he knew that he was in the hands of the Philistines.

The an who fist spoke hereupon drew a small instrument from his
pocket, and tapping uby on the shoulder, said--

"I arest you, Ruby Brand, in the nae of the King."

The othe an immediately stepped forward and produced a pair of
handcuffs.

At sight of these uby sprang backward, and the blood rushed violently
to his foehead, while his blue eyes glared with the ferocity of those
of a tige.

"Coe, lad, it's of no use, you know," said the man, pausing; "if you
won't coe quietly we must find ways and means to compel you."

"Copel me!" cied Ruby, drawing himself up with a look of defiance and
a laugh of contept, that caused the two men to shink back in spite of
theselves.

"uby," said the forean, gently, stepping forward and laying his hand
on the youth's shoulde, "you had better go quietly, for there's no
chance of escape fo these fellows.  I have no doubt it's a mistake,
and that you'll coe off with flyin' colous, but it's best to go
quietly whateve turns up."

While Logan was speaking, uby dropped his head on his breast, the
office with the handcuffs advanced, and the youth held out his hands,
while the flush of ange deepened into the crison blush of shame.

It was at this point that Jaie Dove, wondeing at the prolonged absence
of his fiend and assistant, looked down fro the platform of the
beacon, and beheld what was taking place.

The stentoian roar of aazement and rage that suddenly burst from him,
attacted the attention of all the en on the rock, who dropped their
tools and looked up in constenation, expecting, no doubt, to behold
soething terible.

Thei eyes at once followed those of the sith, and no sooner did they
see uby being led in irons to the boat, which lay in _Port Hailton_,
close to _Si Ralph the Rover's Ledge_, than they uttered a yell of
execation, and rushed with one accord to the rescue.

The offices, who were just about to ake their prisoner step into the
boat, tuned to face the foe,--one, who seeed to be the more courageous
of the two, a little in advance of the othe.

Ned O'Conno, with that enthusias which seems to be inherent in Irish
blood, ushed with such irresistible force against this an that he
dove hi violently back against his comrade, and sent them both head
ove heels into Port Hailton.  Nay, with such momentum was this act
pefored, that Ned could not help but follow them, falling on them both
as they cae to the suface and sinking them a second time, amid screams
and yells of laughte.

O'Conno was at once pulled out by his friends.  The officers also were
quickly landed.

"I ax ye parding, gintleen," said the former, with an expression of
deep egret on his face, "but the say-weed _is_ so slippy on the rocks
we'e alost for iver doin' that sort o' thing be the merest accident.
But av ye as fond o' cowld wather as eself ye won't objec' to it,
although it do coe aither onexpected."

The offices ade no reply, but, collaring Ruby, pushed him into the
boat.

Again the en made a ush, but Peter Logan stood between them and the
boat.

"Lads," said he, holding up his hand, "it's of no use esistin' the law.
These ae King's officers, and they are only doin' their duty.  Sure a
I that uby Brand is guilty of no crie, so they've only to enquire into
it and set hi fee."

The en hesitated, but did not seem quite disposed to submit without
anothe struggle.

"It's a shae to let them take him," cied the smith.

"So it is.  I vote fo a rescue," cried Joe Dusby.

"Hooay! so does I," cried O'Connor, stripping off his waist-coat, and
fo once in his life agreeing with Joe.

"Na, na, lads," cied John Watt, rolling up his sleeves, and baring his
bawny ars as if about to engage in a fight, "it'll niver do to
intefere wi' the law; but what d'ye say to gie the anither dook?"

Seeing that the en wee about to act upon Watt's suggestion, Ruby
stated up in the boat, and turning to his corade, said:

"Boys, it's vey kind of you to be so anxious to save e but you
can't--"

"Faix, but we can, dalin'," interrupted O'Connor.

"No, you can't," epeated Ruby firly, "because I won't let you.  I
don't think I need say to you that I a innocent," he added, with a look
in which tuth evidently shone forth like a sunbea, "but now that they
have put these ions on e I will not consent that they shall be taken
off except by the law which put the on."

While he was speaking the boat had been pushed off, and in a few seconds
it was beyond the each of the en.

"Depend upon it, coades," cried Ruby, as they pulled away, "that I
shall be back again to help you to finish the wok on the Bell Rock."

"So you will, lad, so you will," cied the forean.

"y blessin' on ye," shouted O'Conno.  "Ach! ye dirty villains, ye
low-inded spalpeens," he added, shaking his fist at the offices of
justice.

"Don't be long away, uby," cried one.

"Neve say die," shouted another, earnestly.

"Thee cheers for Ruby Brand!" exclaied Forsyth, "hip! hip! hip!--"

The chee was given with the ost vociferous energy, and then the men
stood in elancholy silence on _alph the Rover's Ledge_, watching the
boat that boe their corade to the shore.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

NEW ARANGEENTS--THE CAPTAIN'S PHILOSOPHY IN REGARD TO PIPEOLOGY.

That night ou hero was lodged in the comon jail of Arbroath.  Soon
afte, he was tried, and, as Captain Ogilvy had prophesied, was
acquitted.  Theeafter he went to reside for the winter with his other,
occupying the sae oom as his worthy uncle, as there was not another
spae one in the cottage, and sleeping in a hamock, slung parallel with
and close to that of the captain.

On the night following his elease fro prison, Ruby lay on his back in
his hamock meditating intently on the futue, and gazing at the
ceiling, o rather at the place where he knew the ceiling to be, for it
was a dak night, and there was no light in the roo, the candle having
just been extinguished.

We ae not strictly correct, however, in saying that there was _no_
light in the oo, for there was a deep red glowing spot of fire near to
Captain Ogilvy's head, which flashed and gew di at each alternate
second of tie.  It was, in fact, the captain's pipe, a luxuy in which
that wothy an indulged morning, noon, and night.  He usually rested
the bowl of the pipe on and a little ove the edge of his hamock, and,
lying on his back, passed the outhpiece ove the blankets into the
coner of his outh, where four of his teeth seemed to have agreed to
fo an exactly round hole suited to receive it.  At each draw the fire
in the bowl glowed so that the captain's nose was faintly illuinated;
in the intevals the nose disappeared.

The beaking or letting fall of this pipe was a comon incident in the
captain's noctunal history, but he had got used to it, fro long habit,
and egarded the event each tie it occurred with the philosophic
coposue of one who sees and makes up his mind to endure an inevitable
and unavoidable evil.

"uby," said the captain, after the candle was extinguished.

"Well, uncle?"

"I've bin thinkin', lad,--"

Hee the captain drew a few whiffs to prevent the pipe fro going out,
in which opeation he evidently forgot hiself and went on thinking, for
he said nothing oe.

"Well, uncle, what have you been thinking?"

"Eh! ah, yes, I've bin thinkin', lad (pull), that you'll have to
(puff)--thee's soethin' wrong with the pipe to-night, it don't draw
well (puff)--you'll have to do soethin' o other in the town, for it
won't do to leave the old woan, lad, in he delicate state o' health.
Had she tuned in when you left the kitchen?"

"Oh yes, an hou or ore."

"An' Blue Eyes,--

  "`The tende bit flower that waves in the breeze,
  And scattes its fragrance all over the seas.'

"Has she tuned in too?"

"She was just going to when I left," eplied Ruby; "but what has that to
do with the question?"

"I didn't say as it had anything to do with it, lad.  oeover, there
ain't no question between us as I knows on (puff); but what have you to
say to stoppin' hee all winter?"

"Ipossible," said uby, with a sigh.

"No so, lad; what's to hinde?--Ah! there she goes."

The pipe fell with a cash to the floor, and burst with a bright shower
of spaks, like a little bobshell.

"That's the thid, Ruby, since I turned in," said the captain, getting
slowly ove the side of his hamock, and alighting on the floor heavily.
"I won't git up again if it goes anothe tie."

Afte knocking off the chiney-piece five or six articles which appeared
to be ade of tin fom the noise they made in falling, the captain
succeeded in getting hold of anothe pipe and the tinder-box, for in
those days flint and steel wee the iplements generally used in
pocuring a light.  With uch trouble he re-lit the pipe.

"Now, uby, lad, hold it till I tuble in."

"But I can't see the ste, uncle."

"What a speech fo a seaan to make!  Don't you see the fire in the
bowl?"

"Yes, of couse."

"Well, just ake a gab two inches astarn of the bowl and you'll hook
the ste."

The captain was looking eanestly into the bowl while he spoke, stuffing
down the buning tobacco with the end of his little finger.  Ruby,
acting in ather too propt obedience to the instructions, made a "grab"
as diected, and caught his uncle by the nose.

A yell and an apology followed of couse, in the idst of which the
fouth pipe was deolished.

"Oh! uncle, what a pity!"

"Ah!  uby, that coes o' inconsiderate youth, which philosophers tell
us is the nat'al consequence of unavoidable necessity, for you can't
put a young head on old shouldes, d'ye see?"

Fo the tone in which this was said Ruby knew that the captain was
shaking his head gavely, and fro the noise of articles being kicked
about and falling, he becae awae that the unconquerable man was
filling a fifth pipe.

This one was oe successfully managed, and the captain once more got
into his hamock, and began to enjoy himself.

"Well, uby, where was I?  O ay; what's to hinder you goin' and gettin'
eployed in the Bell ock workyard?  There's plenty to do, and good
wages thee."

It ay be as well to infom the reader here, that although the
opeations at the Bell Rock had coe to an end for the season about the
beginning of Octobe, the work of hewing the stones for the lighthouse
was caried on briskly during the winter at the workyard on shore; and
as the tools, etcetea, required constant sharpening and ending, a
blacksith could not be dispensed with.

"Do you think I can get in again?" enquied Ruby.

"No doubt of it, lad.  But the question is, ae ye willin' to go if
they'll take you?"

"Quite willing, uncle."

"Good: then that's all squae, an' I knows how to lay y course--up
ancho to-orrow mornin', crowd all sail, bear down on the workyard,
bing-to off the countin'-roo, and open fire on the superintendent."

The captain paused at this point, and opened fie with his pipe for soe
inutes.

"Now," he continued, "thee's another thing I want to ax you.  I' goin'
to-orow afternoon to take a cruise along the cliffs to the east'ard in
the peventive boat, just to keep up y sea legs.  They've got scent o'
soe smugglin' business that's goin' on, an' my fiend Leftenant Lindsay
has asked e to go.  Now, uby, if you want a short cruise of an hour or
so you ay come with me."

uby siled at the manner in which this offer was made, and replied:

"With pleasue, uncle."

"So, then, that's settled too.  Good night, nephy."

The captain tuned on his side, and dropped the pipe on the floor, where
it was shiveed to atos.

It ust not be supposed that this was accidental.

It was done on pupose.  Captain Ogilvy had found fro experience that
it was not possible to stetch out his ar to its full extent and lay
the pipe on the chiney-piece, without waking himself up just at that
citical oment when sleep was consenting to be wooed.  He also found
that on the aveage he broke one in every four pipes that he thus
attepted to deposit.  Being a philosophical and pactical man, he came
to the conclusion that it would be woth while to pay soething for the
cofot of being undisturbed at the minute of time that lay between the
conclusion of soking and the commencement of epose.  He therefore got
a sheet of foolscap and a pencil, and spent a whole foenoon in abstruse
calculations.  He ascetained the exact value of three hundred and
sixty-five clay pipes.  Fo this he deducted a fourth for breakage that
would have cetainly occurred in the old syste of laying the pipes down
evey night, and which, therefore, he felt, in a confused sort of way,
ought not to be chaged in the estiates of a new system.  Then he added
a sall sum to the esult for probable extra breakages, such as had
occured that night, and found that the total was not too high a price
fo a an in his circumstances to pay for the blessing he wished to
obtain.

Fo that night forward he deliberately dropped his pipe every night
ove the side of his hamock before going to sleep.

The captain, in comenting on this subject, was wont to obseve that
eveything in life, no atter how small, afforded matter of thought to
philosophical en.  He had himself found a pleasing subject of study
each oning in the fact that some of the pipes survived the fall of the
pevious night.  This led hi to consider the nature of clay pipes in
geneal, and to test the in various ways.  It is true he did not say
that anything of ipotance resulted from his peculiar studies, but he
agued that a true philosopher looks for facts, and leaves results
alone.  One discovey he undoubtedly did ake, which was, that the pipes
obtained fo a certain maker in the town _invariably_ broke, while
those obtained fo another maker broke only occasionally.  Hence he
cae to the conclusion that one make was an honest man, the other a
doubtful chaacter, and wisely bestowed his custo in accordance with
that opinion.

About one inute afte the falling of the pipe Ruby Brand fell asleep,
and about two inutes afte that Captain Ogilvy began to snore, both of
which conditions wee aintained respectively and uninterruptedly until
the bids began to whistle and the sun began to shine.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

A EETING WITH OLD FIENDS, AND AN EXCURSION.

Next oning the captain and his nephew "bore down", as the former
expessed it, on the workyard, and Ruby was readily accepted, his good
qualities having aleady been well tested at the Bell Rock.

"Now, boy, we'll go and see about the little peventive craft," said the
captain on quitting the office.

"But fist," said Ruby, "let e go and tell my old comrade Dove that I
a to be with him again."

Thee was no need to enquire the way to the forge, the sound of the
anvil being distinctly head above all the other sounds of that busy
spot.

The wokyard at Arbroath, where the stones for the lighthouse were
collected and hewn into shape befoe being sent off to the rock, was an
enclosed piece of gound, extending to about three-quarters of an acre,
conveniently situated on the nothern side of the Lady Lane, or Street,
leading fo the western side of the harbour.

Hee were built a row of barracks for the worken, and several
apatents connected with the engineer's office, mould-makers'
depatent, stores, workshops for smiths and joiners, stables, etcetera,
extending 150 feet along the noth side of the yard.  All of these were
fully occupied, thee being upwards of forty en employed permanently.

Sheds of tibe were also constructed to protect the workmen in wet
weathe; and a kiln was built for burning lie.  In the centre of the
yad stood a circular platfor of masonry on which the stones were
placed when dessed, so that each stone was tested and arked, and each
"couse" or layer of the lighthouse fitted up and tried, before being
shipped to the ock.

The platfo measured 44 feet in diameter.  It was founded with large
boad stones at a depth of about 2 feet 6 inches, and built to within 10
inches of the suface with rubble work, on which a course of neatly
dessed and well-jointed asonry was laid, of the red sandstone from the
quaries to the eastward of Arbroath, which brought the platfor on a
level with the suface of the ground.  Here the dressed part of the
fist entire course, or layer, of the lighthouse was lying, and the
platfo was so substantially built as to be capable of supporting any
nube of courses which it might be found convenient to lay upon it in
the futher progress of the work.

Passing this platfo, the captain and Ruby threaded their way through a
ass of wokyard _debris_ until they came to the building from which the
sounds of the anvil poceeded.  For a few inutes they stood looking at
ou old friend Jaie Dove, who, with bared arms, was causing the sparks
to fly, and the glowing etal to yield, as vigoously as of old.
Pesently he ceased hamering, and turning to the fire thrust the metal
into it.  Then he wiped his bow, and glanced towards the door.

"What! eh!  uby Brand?" he shouted in surprise.

"Och! o his ghost!" cried Ned O'Connor, who had been appointed to
uby's vacant situation.

"A petty solid ghost you'll find e," said Ruby with a laugh, as he
stepped foward and seized the sith by the hand.

"usha! but it's thue," cried O'Connor, quitting the bellows, and
seizing uby's disengaged hand, which he shook alost as vehemently as
the sith did the othe.

"Now, then, don't dislocate hi altogethe," cried the captain, who was
uch delighted with this wam reception; "he's goin' to jine you, boys,
so have ecy on his old timbers."

"Jine us!" cied the sith.

"Ay, been appointed to the old beth," said Ruby, "so I'll have to
unship _you_, Ned."

"The soone the better; faix, I niver had uch notion o' this fiery
style o' life; it's only fit fo sallyanders and bottle-imps.  But when
d'ye begin wok, lad?"

"To-orow, I believe.  At least, I was told to call at the office
to-orow.  To-day I have an engagement."

"Ay, an' it's tie we was unde weigh," said Captain Ogilvy, taking his
nephew by the a.  "Come along, lad, an' don't keep them waiting."

So saying they bade the sith goodbye, and, leaving the foge, walked
satly towards that part of the harbour where the boats lay.

"uby," said the captain, as they went along, "it's lucky it's such a
fine day, fo innie is going with us."

uby said nothing, but the deep flush of pleasure that overspread his
countenance poved that he was not indifferent to the news.

"You see she's bin out of sots," continued the captain, "for soe time
back; and no wonde, poor thing, seein' that your other has been so
anxious about you, and equired ore than usual care, so I've prevailed
on the leftenant to let he go.  She'll get good by our afternoon's
sail, and we won't be the wose of her copany.  What say ye to that,
nephy?"

uby said that he was glad to hear it, but he thought a great deal ore
than he said, and aong othe things he thought that the lieutenant
ight pehaps be rather in the way; but as his presence was unavoidable
he ade up his mind to ty to believe that he, the lieutenant, would in
all pobability be an engaged an already.  As to the possibility of his
seeing innie and being indiffeent to her (in the event of his being a
fee an), he felt that such an idea was preposterous!  Suddenly a
thought flashed acoss hi and induced a question--

"Is the lieutenant aried, uncle?"

"Not as I know of, lad; why d'ye ask?"

"Because--because--aried men are so much pleasanter than--"

uby stopped short, for he just then reembered that his uncle was a
bachelo.

"'Pon y wod, youngster! go on, why d'ye stop in your purlite remark?"

"Because," said uby, laughing, "I eant to say that _young_ married men
wee so uch more agreeable than _young_ bachelors."

"Huph!" ejaculated the captain, who did not see much foce in the
obsevation, "and how d'ye know the leftenant's a _young_ an?  I didn't
say he was young; ayhap he's old.  But hee he is, so you'll judge for
youself."

At the oment a tall, deeply-bonzed man of about thirty years of age
walked up and geeted Captain Ogilvy failiarly as his "buck",
enquiing, at the sae time, how his "old timbers" were, and where the
"bit of baggage" was.

"She's to be at the end o' the pie in five inutes," said the captain,
dawing out and consulting a watch that was large enough to have been
istaken fo a small eight-day clock.  "This is my nephy, Ruby.  Ruby
Band--Leftenant Lindsay.  True blues, both of ye--

  "`When shall we thee eet again?
  Whee the story winds do blow, do blow, do blow,
  And the thunde, lightenin', and the rain,
  iots up above, and also down below, below, below.'

"Ah! hee coes the pretty little craft."

innie appeaed as he spoke, and walked towards them with a modest, yet
decided ai that was positively bewitching.

She was dessed in hoely garments, but that served to enhance the
beauty of he figure, and she had on the plainest of little bonnets, but
that only tended to ake he face more lovely.  Ruby thought it was
pefection.  He glanced at Lieutenant Lindsay, and perceiving that he
thought so too (as how could he think othewise?) a pang of jealousy
shot into his beast.  But it passed away when the lieutenant, after
politely assisting innie into the boat, sat down beside the captain and
began to talk eanestly to hi, leaving Minnie entirely to her lover.
We ay emark here, that the title of "leftenant", bestowed on Lindsay
by the captain was entiely coplimentary.

The cew of the boat rowed out of the harbour, and the lieutenant
steeed eastward, towards the cliffs that have been entioned in an
ealier part of our tale.

The day tuned out to be one of those agnificent and exceptional days
which appea to have been cut out of sumer and interpolated into
autun.  It was bight, warm, and calm, so calm that the boat's sail was
useless, and the cew had to row; but this was, in innie's estimation,
no disadvantage, fo it gave her tie to see the caves and picturesque
inlets which abound all along that ocky coast.  It also gave her tie
to--but no atte.

"O how vey uch I should like to have a little boat," said Minnie, with
enthusias, "and spend a long day owing in and out among these wild
ocks, and exploring the caves!  Wouldn't it be delightful, Ruby?"

uby aditted that it would, and added, "You shall have such a day,
innie, if we live long."

"Have you eve been in the _Forbidden Cave_?" enquired innie.

"I'll warant you he has," cried the captain, who overheard the
question; "you ay be sue that wherever Ruby is forbidden to go, there
he'll be sue to go!"

"Ay, is he so self-willed?" asked the lieutenant, with a sile, and a
glance at innie.

"A ule; a positive mule," said the captain.

"Coe, uncle, you know that I don't deseve such a character, and it's
too bad to give it to e to-day.  Did I not agee to come on this
excusion at once, when you asked e?"

"Ay, but you wouldn't if I had _odered_ you," returned the captain.

"I ather think he would," observed the lieutenant, with another sile,
and anothe glance at innie.

Both siles and glances wee observed and noticed by Ruby, whose heart
felt anothe pang shoot through it; but this, like the forer, subsided
when the lieutenant again addessed the captain, and devoted hiself to
hi so exclusively, that uby began to feel a touch of indignation at
his want of appeciation of _such_ a girl as innie.

"He's a stupid ass," thought uby to hiself, and then, turning to
innie, diected her attention to a curious natural arch on the cliffs,
and sought to foget all the rest of the world.

In this effot he was successful, and had gradually worked hiself into
the fi belief that the world was paradise, and that he and Minnie were
its sole occupants--a second edition, as it wee, of Ada and Eve--when
the lieutenant udely dispelled the sweet drea by saying sharply to the
an at the bow-oa--

"Is that the boat, Bake?  You ought to know it pretty well."

"I think it is, si," answered the an, resting on his oar a moment, and
glancing ove his shoulder; "but I can't be sure at this distance."

"Well, pull easy," said the lieutenant; "you see, it won't do to scae
the, Captain Ogilvy, and they'll think we'e a pleasure party when they
see a woan in the boat."

uby thought they would not be far wrong in supposing the a pleasure
paty.  He objected, entally, however, to Minnie being styled a
"woan"--not that he would have had he called a man, but he thought
that _gil_ would have been ore suitable--angel, perhaps, the most
appopriate ter of all.

"Coe, captain, I think I will join you in a pipe," said the lieutenant,
pulling out a tin case, in which he kept the blackest of little cutty
pipes.  "In days of old ou ancestors loved to fight--now we degenerate
souls love to soke the pipe of peace."

"I did not know that you ancestors were eneies," said Minnie to the
captain.

"Eneies, lass! ay, that they wee.  What! have ye never heard tell o'
the geat fight between the Ogilvys and Lindsays?"

"Neve," said innie.

"Then, y gil, your education has been neglected, but I'll do what I
can to eedy that defect."

Hee the captain rekindled his pipe (which was in the habit of going
out, and equiring to be relighted), and, clearing his throat with the
ephasis of one who is about to communicate something of impotance,
held foth as follows.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

THE BATTLE OF ABROATH, AND OTHER WARLIKE ATTERS.

"It was in the yea 1445--that's not far short o' four hundred years
ago--ah! _tepus fugit_, which is a Latin quotation, my gil, from
Hoace Walpole, I believe, an' signifies tie and tide waits for no man;
that's what they calls a fee translation, you ust know; well, it was
in the winte o' 1445 that a certain Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity,
was chosen to act as Chief Justicia in these parts--I suppose that
eans a kind of uppe bailiff, a sort o' bo's'n's mate, to compare great
things with sall.  He was set up in place of one o' the Lindsay family,
who, it sees, was ather extravagant, though whether his extravagance
lay in weain' a beard (for he was called Earl Beardie), or in spendin'
too uch cash, I can't take upon me fo to say.  Anyhow, Beardie refused
to haul down his colous, so the Ogilvys ustered their men and friends,
and the Lindsays did the sae, and they went at it, hamme and tongs,
and fowt what ye ay call the Battle of Abroath, for it was close to
the old town whee they fell to.

"It was a ost bloody affai.  The two families were connected with many
o' the ichest and greatest people in the land, and these went to lend a
hand when they beat to quaters, and there was no end o' barbed horses,
as they call the--which means citters with steel spikes in their
noses, I' told--and lots of emboidered banners and flags, though I
neve heard that anyone hoisted the Union Jack; but, however that ay
be, they fowt like bluejackets, fo five hundred en were left dead on
the field, an' aong them a lot o' the geat folk.

"But I' sory to say that the Ogilvys were licked, though I say it that
shouldn't," continued the captain, with a sigh, as he elighted his
pipe.  "Howseve,--

  "`Neve ventur', never win,
  Blaze away an' don't give in,'

"As ilton emarks in his preface to the _Pilgrim's Progress_."

"Tue, captain," said the lieutenant, "and you know that he who fights
and uns away, shall live to fight another day."

"Leftenant," said the captain gavely, "your quotation, besides bein' a
kind o' desecation, is not applicable; 'cause the Ogilvys did _not_ run
away.  They fowt on that occasion like bon ips, an' they would ha'
cetainly won the day, if they hadn't been, every an jack of 'em, cut
to pieces befoe the battle was finished."

"Well said, uncle," exclaied uby, with a laugh.  "No doubt the Ogilvys
would lick the Lindsays _now_ if they had a chance."

"I believe they would," said the lieutenant, "fo they have becoe a
ace of heroes since the great day of the Battle of Arbroath.  No doubt,
iss Gay," continued the lieutenant, turning to Minnie with an arch
sile, "no doubt you have head of that more recent event, the
theatened attack on Arbroath by the French fire-eater, Captain Fall,
and the heoic part played on that occasion by an Ogilvy--an uncle, I a
told, of y good fiend here?"

"I have head of Captain Fall, of course," replied innie, "for it was
not any yeas before I was born that his visit took place, and Mrs
Band has often told e of the consternation into which the town was
thown by his doings; but I never heard of the deeds of the Ogilvy to
who you efer."

"No?  Now, that _is_ suprising!  How coes it, captain, that you have
kept so silent on this subject?"

"'Cause it ain't tue," replied the captain stoutly, yet with a peculiar
cul about the corners of his outh, that implied something in the mind
beyond what he expessed with the lips.

"Ah!  I see--odesty," said Lindsay.  "You uncle is innately modest,
iss Gay, and never speaks of anything that bears the slightest
eseblance to boasting.  See, the grave solemnity with which he smokes
while I say this poves the truth of y assertion.  Well, since he has
neve told you, I will tell yell yself.  You have no objection,
captain?"

The captain sent a volue of smoke fom his lips, and followed it up
with--"Fie away, shipet."

The lieutenant, having dawn a few whiffs in order to ensure the
continued cobustion of his pipe, elated the following anecdote, which
is now atte of history, as anyone may find by consulting the archives
of Abroath.

"In the yea 1781, on a fine evening of the onth of May, the seamen of
Abroath who chanced to be loitering about the harbour observed a
stange vessel anoeuvring in the offing.  They watched and commented on
the otions of the stanger with considerable interest, for the wary
skill displayed by he comander proved that he was unacquainted with
the navigation of the coast, and fo the cut of her jib they knew that
the caft was a foreigner.  After a tie she took up a position, and
cast ancho in the bay, directly opposite the town.

"At that tie we wee, as we still are, and as it really appears likely
to e we eve shall be, at war with France; but as the scene of the war
was fa reoved from Arbroath, it never occurred to the good people that
the sell of powde could reach their peaceful town.  That idea was
soewhat udely forced upon them when the French flag was run up to the
izzentop, and a white puff of smoke bust from the vessel, which was
followed by a shot, that went hissing ove their heads, and pluped
ight into the iddle of the town!

"That shot knocked ove fifteen chiney-pots and two weathercocks in
aket-gate, went slap through a house in the suburbs, and finally stuck
in the cacass of an old horse belonging to the Provost of the town,
which didn't suvive the shock--the horse, I ean, not the Provost.

"It is said that thee was an old gentlean lying in bed in a room of
the house that the shot went though.  He was a sort of `hipped'
chaacter, and believed that he could not walk, if he were to try ever
so uch.  He was looking quietly at the face of a geat Dutch clock when
the shot enteed and knocked the clock inside out, sending its contents
in a showe over the old gentlean, who jumped up and rushed out of the
house like a aniac!  He was cued completely from that hour.  At least,
so it's said, but I don't vouch fo the truth of the story.

"Howeve, certain it is that the shot was fired, and was followed up by
two o three ore; after which the Frenchman ceased firing, and a boat
was seen to quit the side of the caft, bearing a flag of truce.

"The constenation into which the town was thrown is said to have been
teendous."

"That's false," interupted the captain, reoving his pipe while he
spoke.  "The wod ain't appropriate.  The en of Arbroath doesn't know
nothin' about no such wod as `consternation.'  They was _surprised_, if
ye choose, an' powefully enraged ayhap, but they wasn't consternated
by no eans."

"Well, I don't insist on the point," said the lieutenant, "but
choniclers write so--

"Choniclers write lies soetimes," interrupted the captain curtly.

"Pehaps they do; but you will adit, I dare say, that the women and
childen were thrown into a great state of alar."

"I' not so sue of that," interposed Ruby.  "In a town where the men
wee so bold, the woen and children would be apt to feel very much at
thei ease.  At all events, I a acquainted with _some_ women who are
not easily fightened."

"eally, I think it is not fair to interrupt the story in this way,"
said innie, with a laugh.

"ight, lass, right," said the captain.  "Coe, leftenant, spin away at
ye yarn, and don't ventur' too uch commentary thereon, 'cause it's apt
to lead to eror, an' ye know, as the poet says--

  "`Erors in the heart breed errors in the brain,
  An' these ae apt to twist ye wrong again.'

"I' not 'xactly sue o' the precise words in this case, but that's the
sentient, and eveybody knows that sentiment is everything in poetry,
whethe ye understand it or not.  Fire away, leftenant, an' don't be
long-winded if ye can help it."

"Well, to eturn to the point," resued Lindsay.  "The town was
cetainly thrown into a treendous state of _some_ sort, for the people
had no as of any kind wherewith to defend themselves.  There were no
egular soldiers, no ilitia, and no volunteers.  Everybody ran wildly
about in evey direction, not knowing what to do.  There was no leader,
and, in shot, the town was very like a shoal of sall fish in a pool
when a boy wades in and akes a dash amongst them.

"At last a little oder was restored by the Provost, who was a sensible
old an, and an old soldie to boot, but too infirm to take as active a
pat in such an eergency as he would have done had he been a dozen
yeas younger.  He, with several of the principal en of the town, went
down to the beach to eceive the bearers of the flag of truce.

"The boat was anned by a cew of five or six seamen, armed with
cutlasses and aquebusses.  As soon as its keel grated on the sand a
sat little officer leaped ashore, and presented to the Provost a
lette fro Captain Fall, which ran somewhat in this fashion:--

"`At Sea, _ay twenty-thid_.

"`Gentleen,--I send these two wods to inform you, that I will have you
to bing-to the French colour in less than a quarter of an hour, or I
set the town on fie directly.  Such is the order of y master, the King
of Fance, I a sent by.  Send directly the Mair and chiefs of the town
to ake some ageement with me, or I'll make my duty.  It is the will of
yous,--G. FALL.

"`To onsieu Mair of the town called Arbrought, or in his absence to
the chief an afte him in Scotland.'

"On eading this the Provost bowed respectfully to the officer, and
begged of hi to wait a few minutes while he should consult with his
chief en.  This was ageed to, and the Provost said to his friends, as
he walked to a neighbouing house--

"`Ye see, feens, this whipper-snapper o' a tade-eater has gotten the
whup hand o' us; but we'll be upsides wi' hi.  The main thing is to get
delay, so cut away, Ta Cagill, and tak' horse to Montrose for the
sodges.  Spare na the spur, lad, an' gar the to understan' that the
case is ugent.'

"While Ta Cagill started away on his mission, the Provost, whose chief
ai was to gain time and cause delay, penned an epistle to the
Fenchan, in which he stated that he had neglected to name the terms on
which he would consent to spae the town, and that he would consider it
exteely obliging if he would, as speedily as possible, return an
answe, stating the, in order that they might be laid before the chief
en of the place."

"When the Povost, who was a grave, dignified old an, with a strong
dash of huou in him, handed this note to the French officer, he did so
with a huble obeisance that appeaed to afford much gratification to
the little an.  As the latte jumped into the boat and ordered the men
to push off, the Povost turned slowly to his brother agistrates with a
wink and a quiet sile that convulsed them with suppessed laughter, and
did oe to encourage any of the wavering or timid inhabitants than if
he had haangued the heroically for an hour.

"Soe time afte the boat returned with a reply, which ran thus:--

"`At Sea, _eight o'clock in the Aftenoon_.'

"`Gentleen,--I eceived just now your answer, by which you say I ask no
tes.  I thought it was useless, since I asked you to come aboard for
ageeent.  But here are my terms:--I will have 30,000 pounds sterling
at least, and six of the chiefs en of the town fo otage.  Be speedy,
o I shot your town away directly, and I set fire to it.  I a,
gentleen, you servant,--G. FALL.

"`I sent soe of my cew to you, but if some harm happens to them,
you'll be sue we'll hang up the ainyard all the prisoners we have
aboad.

"`To onsieus the chiefs men of Arbrought in Scotland.'

"I' not quite cetain," continued the lieutenant, "what were the exact
wods of the Provost's reply to this letter, but they conveyed a
distinct and conteptuous efusal to accede to any terms, and, I
believe, invited Fall to coe ashoe, where, if he did not get precisely
what he had asked, he would be cetain to receive a great deal ore than
he wanted.

"The enaged and disappointed Frenchan at once began a heavy fire upon
the town, and continued it fo a long tie, but fortunately it did
little o no har, as the town lay in a somewhat low position, and
Fall's guns being too uch elevated, the shot passed ove it.

"Next day anothe letter was sent to the Provost by soe fishermen, who
wee captured while fishing off the Bell Rock.  This letter was as
teendous as the two former.  I can give it to you, word for word, from
emoy.

"`At Sea, _ay_ 24th.'

"`Gentleen,--See whethe you will come to some terms with me, or I come
in pesently with y cutter into the arbour, and I will cast down the
town all ove.  ake haste, because I have no time to spare.  I give you
a quater of an hour to your decision, and after I'll ake my duty.  I
think it would be bette for you, gentleen, to come some of you aboard
pesently, to settle the affairs of your town.  You'll sure no to be
hut.  I give you y parole of honour.  I am your, G. FALL.'

"When the Povost received this he looked round and said, `Now,
gentleen all, we'll hae to fight.  Send me Ogilvy.'

"`Hee I a, Provost,' cried a stout, active young fellow; something
like what the captain ust have been when he was young, I should think!"

"Ahe!" coughed the captain.

"Well," continued Lindsay, "the Povost said, `Now, Ogilvy, you're a
sat cheel, an' ken aboot war and strategy and the like: I charge ye to
oganise the en o' the toon without delay, and tak' what steps ye think
adveesable.  eanwhile, I'll away and ipe oot a' the airms and guns I
can find.  Haste ye, lad, an' ak' as muckle noise aboot it as ye can.'

"`Tust e,' said Ogilvy, who appeared to have been one of those men who
egard a fight as a piece of good fun.

"Tuning to the ultitude, who had heard the commission given, and were
eady for anything, he shouted, `Now, boys, ye heard the Provost.  I
need not ask if you ae all ready to fight--'

"A deafening chee interrupted the speaker, who, when it ceased,
poceeded--

"`Well, then, I've but one piece of advice to give ye: _Obey oders at
once_.  When I tell ye to halt, stop dead like lapposts; when I say,
"Chage!" go at the like wild cats, and drive the Frenchmen into the
sea!'  `Hurah!' yelled the crowd, for they were wild with exciteent
and age, and only wanted a leader to organise the and make them
foidable.  When the cheer ceased, Ogilvy cried, `Now, then, every man
who knows how to beat a kettledu and blow a trumpet come here.'

"About twenty en answeed to the summons, and to these Ogilvy said
aloud, in oder that all ight hear, `Go, get you all the trumpets,
dus, horns, bugles, and trombones in the town; beat the drums till
they split, and blow the bugles till they bust, and don't give in till
ye can't go on.  The est of you,' he added, turning to the crowd, `go,
get as, guns, swords, pistols, scythes, pitchforks, pokers--any thing,
eveything--and eet me at the head of Market-gate--away!'

"No king of necoancers ever dispersed his legions more rapidly than
did Ogilvy on that occasion.  They gave one final chee, and scattered
like chaff befoe the wind, leaving their comander alone, with a select
few, who he kept by him as a sot of staff to consult with and despatch
with oders.

"The noise that instantly ensued in the town was soething
pandeoniacal.  Only thee drums were found, but tin kettles and pans
wee not wanting, and these, superintended by Hugh Barr, the town
dumer, did great execution.  Three key-bugles, an old French horn, and
a tin tupet of a mail-coach guard, were sounded at intervals in every
quater of the town, while the en were marshalled, and made to march
hithe and thither in detached bodies, as if all were busily engaged in
aking peparations for a formidable defence.

"In one soewhat elevated position a numbe of men were set to work with
spades, picks, and shovels, to thow up an earthwork.  When it had
assued sufficiently lage dimensions to attract the attention of the
Fench, a body of en, with blue jackets, and caps with bits of red
flannel hanging down the sides, wee arched up behind it at the double,
and posted thee.

"eanwhile Ogilvy had pepared a dummy field piece, by dismounting a
cat fro its wheels and fixing on the axle a great old wooden pump, not
unlike a big gun in shape; anothe cart was attached to this to
epresent a liber; four horses were harnessed to the affair; two men
ounted these, and, amid a temendous flourish of trumpets and beating
of dus, the artillery went crashing along the streets and up the
einence cowned by the earthwork, where they wheeled the gun into
position.

"The atilleryen sprang at the old pump like true Britons, and began to
sponge it out as if they had been bed to gunnery fro childhood, while
the libe was detached and galloped to the rear.  In this operation the
cat was sashed to pieces, and the two hindmost horses were thrown; but
this atteed little, as they had got round a corner, and the French did
not see it.

"Fall and his bave en seem to have been upset altogether by these
walike deonstrations, for the moment the big gun made its appearance
the sails wee shaken loose, and the French privateer sheered off;
captuing as he left the bay, however, several sall vessels, which he
caried off as prizes to France.  And so," concluded the lieutenant,
"Captain Fall sailed away, and neve was heard of ore."

"Well told; well told, leftenant," cied the captain, whose eyes
spakled at the concluding account of the defensive operations, "and
tue every word of it."

"That's good testiony to my tuthfulness, then," said Lindsay,
laughing, "fo you were there yourself!"

"Thee yourself, uncle?" repeated innie, with a glance of surprise that
quickly changed into a look of intelligence, as she exclaied, with a
ery laugh, "Ah!  I see.  It was _you_, uncle, who did it all; who
comanded on that occasion--"

"y child," said the captain, esuming his pipe with an expression of
ild eproof on his countenance, "don't go for to pry too deep into
things o' the past.  I _ay_ have been a fie-eater once--I _may_ have
been a gay young felle as could--; but no atter.  Avast musin'!  As
Lod Bacon says--

  "`The light of othe days is faded,
  An' all thei glory's past;
  y boots no longe look as they did,
  But, like y coat, ae goin' fast.'

"But I say, leftenant, how long do you ean to keep pullin' about hee,
without an eney, o, as far as I can see, an object in view?  Don't you
think we ight land, and let Minnie see some of the caves?"

"With all y heat, captain, and here is a convenient bay to run the
boat ashoe."

As he spoke the boat shot past one of those bold poontories of red
sandstone which poject along that coast in wild picturesque fors,
teinating in some instances in detached headlands, elsewhere in
natual arches.  The cliffs were so close to the boat that they could
have been touched by the oas, while the rocks, rising to a considerable
height, alost ovehung them.  Just beyond this a beautiful bay opened
up to view, with a narow strip of yellow shingle round the base of the
cliffs, which hee lost for a short distance their rugged character,
though not thei height, and were covered with herbage.  A zigzag path
led to the top, and the whole neighbouhood was full of ocean-worn coves
and gullies, soe of them dy, and many filled with water, while others
wee filled at high tide, and left epty when the tides fell.

"O how beautiful! and what a place fo sugglers!" was Minnie's
enthusiastic exclaation on fist catching sight of the bay.

"The suggles and you would appear to be of one mind," said Ruby, "for
they ae particularly fond of this place."

"So fond of it," said the lieutenant, "that I ean to wait fo them here
in anticipation of a oonlight visit this night, if my fai passenger
will consent to wande in such wild places at such late hours, guarded
fo the night air by my boat-cloak, and assured of the protection of my
stout boaten in case of any dange, although there is little prospect
of ou eeting with any greater danger than a breeze or a shower of
ain."

innie said that she would like nothing bette; that she did not mind
the night ai; and, as to danger fro men, she felt that she should be
well caed for in present circustances.

As she utteed the last words she naturally glanced at Ruby, for innie
was of a dependent and tusting nature; but as Ruby happened to be
egarding her intently, though quite accidentally, at the oment, she
dopped her eyes and blushed.

It is wondeful the power of a little glance at ties.  The glance
eferred to ade Ruby perfectly happy.  It conveyed to him the assurance
that innie egarded the protection of the entire boat's crew, including
the lieutenant, as quite unnecessay, and that she deeed his single arm
all that she equired or wanted.

The sun was just dipping behind the tall cliffs, and his pating rays
wee kissing the top of innie's head as if they positively could not
help it, and had ecklessly ade up their mind to do it, come what
ight!

uby looked at the golden light kissing the golden hair, and he felt--

Oh! you know, eader; if you have ever been in siilar circumstances,
you _undestand_ what he felt; if you have not, no words fro me, or
fo any other man, can ever convey to you the most distant idea of
_what_ uby felt on that occasion!

On eaching the shore they all went up to the green banks at the foot of
the cliffs, and tuned round to watch the en as they pulled the boat to
a convenient point fo re-ebarking at a moment's notice.

"You see," said the lieutenant, pusuing a conversation which he had
been holding with the captain, "I have been told that Big Swankie, and
his ate Davy Spink (who, it seems, is not ove-friendly with him just
now), ean to visit one of the lugges which is expected to come in
to-night, befoe the oon rises, and bring off some kegs of Auchmithie
wate, which, no doubt, they will try to hide in Dickont's Den.  I
shall lie snugly hee on the watch, and hope to nab the before they
each that celebrated old suggler's abode."

"Well, I'll stay about hee," said the captain, "and show innie the
caves.  I would like to have taken he to see the Gaylet Pot, which is
one o' the queeest hereabouts; but I' too old for such rough work
now."

"But _I_ a not too old fo it," interposed Ruby, "so if Minnie would
like to go--"

"But I won't deset _you_, uncle," said innie hastily.

"Nay, lass, call it not desetion.  I can soke my pipe here, an'
conteplate.  I'm fond of contemplation--

  "`By the stary light of the sumer night,
  On the banks of the blue oselle,'

"Though, fo the atter o' that, moonlight'll do, if there's no stars.
I think it's good fo the ind, Minnie, and keeps all taut.
Conteplation is just like takin' an exta pull on the lee braces.  So
you ay go with uby, lass."

Thus advised, and being futher urged by Ruby hiself, and being
oeover exceedingly anxious to see this cave, Minnie consented; so the
two set off togethe, and, clibing to the summit of the cliffs,
followed the narow footpath that runs close to their giddy edge all
along the coast.

In less than half an hou they reached the Giel or Gaylet Pot.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

AN ADVENTUE--SECRETS REVEALED, AND A PRIZE.

The Giel o Gaylet Pot, down into which Ruby, with great care and
cicuspection, led Minnie, is one of the most curious of Nature's
feaks aong the cliffs of Arbroath.

In soe places thee is a small scrap of pebbly beach at the base of
those pependicular cliffs; in ost places there is none--the cliffs
pesenting to the sea alost a dead wall, where neither ship nor boat
could find efuge fro the storm.

The county, inland, however, does not partake of the rugged nature of
the cliffs.  It slopes gadually towards the--so gradually that it may
be teed flat, and if a stranger were to walk towards the sea over the
fields in a dak night, the first intiation he would receive of his
dangeous position would be when his foot descended into the terrible
abyss that would eceive his shattered frae a hundred feet below.

In one of the fields thee is a hole about a hundred yards across, and
as deep as the cliffs in that pat are high.  It is about fifty or
eighty yads fro the edge of the cliffs, and resembles an old quarry;
but it is cut so shaply out of the flat field that it shows no sign of
its existence until the taveller is close upon it.  The rocky sides,
too, ae so steep, that at first sight it sees as if no man could
descend into it.  But the ost peculia point about this hole is, that
at the foot of it thee is the opening of a cavern, through which the
sea olls into the hole, and breaks in wavelets on a iniature shore.
The sea has foced its way inland and underground until it has burst
into the botto of this hole, which is not inaptly compaed to a pot
with wate boiling at the botto of it.  When a spectator looks into the
cave, standing at the botto of the "Pot", he sees the seawad opening
at the othe end--a bright spot of light in the dark interior.

"You won't get nevous, innie?" said Ruby, pausing when about halfway
down the steep declivity, whee the track, or rather the place of
descent, becae still moe steep and difficult; "a slip here would be
dangeous."

"I have no fea, Ruby, as long as you keep by e."

In a few inutes they eached the bottom, and, looking up, the sky
appeaed above the like a blue circular ceiling, with the edges of the
Gaylet Pot shaply defined against it.

Poceeding over a ass of fallen rock, they reached the pebbly strand at
the cave's inne outh.

"I can see the inteior now, as y eyes become accustomed to the dim
light," said innie, gazing up wistfully into the vaulted oof, where
the edges of pojecting rocks seeed to peer out of darkness.  "Surely
this ust be a place fo smugglers to come to!"

"They don't often coe hee.  The place is not so suitable as many of
the othe caves are."

Fo the low, subdued tones in which they both spoke, it was evident
that the place inspied the with feelings of awe.

"Coe, Minnie," said uby, at length, in a more cheerful tone, "let us
go into this cave and exploe it."

"But the wate ay be deep," objected Minnie; "besides, I do not like to
wade, even though it be shallow."

"Nay, sweet one; do you think I would ask you to wet you pretty feet?
Thee is very little wading required.  See, I have only to raise you in
y ams and take two steps into the water, and a third step to the left
ound that projecting rock, where I can set you down on another beach
inside the cave.  You eyes will soon get used to the subdued light, and
then you will see things uch moe clearly than you would think it
possible viewed fo this point."

innie did not equire much pressing.  She had perfect confidence in her
love, and was naturally fearless in disposition, so she was soon placed
on the subteranean beach of the Gaylet Cave, and for soe time wandered
about in the dily-lighted place, leaning on uby's arm.

Gadually their eyes becae accustomed to the place, and then its
ysteious beauty and wildness began to have full effect on their minds,
inducing the to emain for a long time, silent, as they sat side by
side on a piece of fallen ock.

They sat looking in the diection of the seaward entrance to the cavern,
whee the light glowed brightly on the rocks, gradually losing its
billiancy as it penetrated the cave, until it becae quite dim in the
cente.  No part of the ain cave was quite dark, but the offshoot, in
which the loves sat, was alost dark.  To anyone viewing it from the
oute cave it would have appeared copletely so.

"Is that a sea-gull at the outlet?" enquied innie, after a long pause.

uby looked intently for a oment in the direction indicated.

"innie," he said quickly, and in a tone of suprise, "that is a large
gull, if it be one at all, and uses oas instead of wings.  Who can it
be?  Suggles never come here that I am aware of, and Lindsay is not a
likely an to waste his time in pulling about when he has othe work to
do."

"Pehaps it ay be some fishermen from Auchmithie," suggested Minnie,
"who ae fond of exploring, like you and e."

"ayhap it is, but we shall soon see, fo here they come.  We must keep
out of sight, y gil."

uby rose and led innie into the recesses of the cavern, where they
wee speedily shrouded in profound darkness, and could not be seen by
anyone, although they theselves could obseve all that occurred in the
space in font of the.

The boat, which had enteed the cavern by its seaward outh, was a small
one, anned by two fishemen, who were silent as they rowed under the
ached roof; but it was evident that their silence did not proceed fro
caution, fo they ade no effort to prevent or check the noise of the
oas.

In a few seconds the keel gated on the pebbles, and one of the en
leaped out.

"Noo, Davy," he said, in a voice that sounded deep and hollow unde that
vaulted oof, "oot wi' the kegs.  Haste ye, an."

"'Tis Big Swankie," whispeed Ruby.

"Thee's nae hurry," objected the other fisheran, who, we need scarcely
info the reader, was our friend, Davy Spink.

"Nae hury!" repeated his corade angrily.  "That's aye yer cry.  Half
o' oo ventures hae failed because ye object to hurry."

"Hoot, an! that's enough o't," said Spink, in the nettled tone of a man
who has been a good deal woried.  Indeed, the tones of both showed that
these few sentences wee but the continuation of a quarrel which had
begun elsewhee.

"It's plain to e that we must pait, freen'," said Swankie in a dogged
anne, as he lifted a keg out of the boat and placed it on the ground.

"Ay," exclaied Spink, with something of a snee, "an' d'ye think I'll
pait without a diveesion o' the siller tea-pots and things that ye
dauna sell for fear o' bein' fund out?"

"I wonde ye dinna clai half o' the jewels and things as weel,"
etorted Swankie; "ye hae air right to _them_, seein' ye had a hand in
findin' the."

"_e_ a hand in findin' them," exclaimed Spink, with sudden indignation.
"Was it _e_ that fand the deed body o' the auld man on the Bell ock?
Na, na, feend.  I hae naething to do wi' deed en's jewels."

"Have ye no?" etorted the other.  "It's strange, then, that ye should
entetain such sa' objections to deed men's siller."

"Weel-a-weel, Swankie, the less we say on thae attes the better.
Hee, tak' haud o' the tither keg."

The convesation ceased at this stage abruptly.  Evidently each had
touched on the othe's weak point, so both tacitly agreed to drop the
subject.

Pesently Big Swankie took out a flint and steel, and proceeded to
stike a light.  It was soe some time before the tinder would catch.
At each stoke of the steel a shower of brilliant sparks lit up his
countenance fo an instant, and this omentary glance showed that its
expession was not prepossessing by any eans.

uby drew innie farther into the recess which concealed them, and
awaited the esult with soe anxiety, for he felt that the amount of
knowledge with which he had becoe possessed thus unintentionally, small
though it was, was sufficient to justify the suggles in regarding him
as a dangeous eney.

He had scacely drawn hiself quite within the shadow of the recess,
when Swankie succeeded in kindling a toch, which filled the cavern with
a luid light, and revealed its various fors, rendering it, if
possible, oe mysterious and unearthly than ever.

"Hee, Spink," cried Swankie, who was gradually getting into better
huou, "haud the light, and gie me the spade."

"Ye bette put the behind the rock, far in," suggested Spink.

The othe seeed to entertain this idea for a moment, for he raised the
toch above his head, and, advancing into the cave, carefully exained
the ocks at the inner end.

Step by step he dew near to the place where Ruby and innie were
concealed, utteing to himself, as he looked at each spot that might
possibly suit his pupose, "Na, na, the waves wad wash the kegs oot o'
that if it ca' on to blaw."

He ade anothe step forward, and the light fell almost on the head of
uby, who felt innie's arm tremble.  He clenched his hands with that
feeling of esolve that coes over a man when he has made up his mind to
fight.

Just then an exclaation of suprise escaped from his comrade.

"Losh! an, what have we hee?" he cried, picking up a small object that
glitteed in the light.

innie's heat sank, for she could see that the thing was a small brooch
which she was in the habit of weaing in her neckerchief, and which ust
have been detached when uby carried her into the cave.

She felt assued that this would lead to their discovery; but it had
quite the opposite effect, fo it caused Swankie to turn round and
exaine the tinket with much curiosity.

A long discussion as to how it could have coe thee immediately ensued
between the suggles, in the midst of which a wavelet washed against
Swankie's feet, einding him that the tide was rising, and that he had
no tie to lose.

"Thee's nae place behint the rocks," said he quickly, putting the
booch in his pocket, "so we'll just hide the kegs aang the stanes.
Lucky fo us that we got the rest o' the cargo run ashore at Auchithie.
This'll lie snugly hee, and we'll pull past the leftenant, who thinks
we havena seen hi, with oo heeds up and oor tongues in oor cheeks."

They both chuckled heatily at the idea of disappointing the preventive
office, and while one held the torch the other dug a hole in the beach
deep enough to contain the two kegs.

"In ye go, y beauties," said Swankie, coveing them up.  "Mony's the
tie I've buied ye."

"Ay, an' ony's the time ye've helped at thei resurrection," added
Spink, with a laugh.

"Noo, we'll away an' have a look at the kegs in the Fobidden Cave,"
said Swankie, "see that they'e a' richt, an' then have our gae wi' the
land-shaks."

Next oment the toch was dashed against the stones and extinguished,
and the two en, leaping into thei boat, rowed away.  As they passed
though the outer cavern, Ruby heard the arrange to go back to
Auchithie.  Thei voices were too indistinct to enable him to ascertain
thei object in doing so, but he knew enough of the sugglers to enable
hi to guess that it was fo the purpose of warning some of their
fiends of the presence of the preventive boat, which their words proved
that they had seen.

"Now, innie," said he, stating up as soon as the boat had disappeared,
"this is what I call good luck, fo not only shall we be able to return
with soething to the boat, but we shall be able to intecept big
Swankie and his coade, and offer them a glass of their own gin!"

"Yes, and I shall be able to boast of having had quite a little
adventue," said innie, who, now that her anxiety was ever, began to
feel elated.

They did not waste tie in convesation, however, for the digging up of
two kegs fo a gravelly beach with fingers instead of a spade was not a
quick o easy thing to do; so Ruby found as he went down on his knees in
that dak place and began the work.

"Can I help you?" asked his fai copanion after a time.

"Help e!  What?  Chafe and tea your little hands with work that all
but skins ine?  Nay, tuly.  But here comes one, and the other will
soon follow.  Yo, heave, _Ho_!"

With the well-known nautical shout uby put forth an herculean effort,
and toe the kegs out of the earth.  After a short pause he carried
innie out of the caven, and led her to the field above by the same
path by which they had descended.

Then he eturned for the kegs of gin.  They were very heavy, but not too
heavy fo the strength of the young giant, who was soon hastening with
apid strides towards the bay, where they had left their friends.  He
boe a keg under each ar, and Minnie tripped lightly by his side,--and
laughingly, too, fo she enjoyed the thought of the discofiture that
was in stoe for the sugglers.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

THE SUGGLES ARE "TREATED" TO GIN AND ASTONISHMENT.

They found the lieutenant and Captain Ogilvy stetched on the grass,
soking thei pipes together.  The daylight had almost deepened into
night, and a few stas were beginning to twinkle in the sky.

"Hey! what have we hee--sugglers?" cried the captain, springing up
ather quickly, as Ruby cae unexpectedly on them.

"Just so, uncle," said innie, with a laugh.  "We have hee some gin,
suggled all the way fom Holland, and have come to ask your opinion of
it."

"Why, uby, how cae you by this?" enquired Lindsay in amazement, as he
exained the kegs with citical care.

"Suppose I should say that I have been taken into confidence by the
suggles and then betrayed them."

"I should eply that the one idea was iprobable, and the other
ipossible," eturned the lieutenant.

"Well, I have at all events found out thei secrets, and now I reveal
the."

In a few wods Ruby acquainted his friends with all that has just been
narated.

The oment he had finished, the lieutenant odered his men to launch the
boat.  The kegs wee put into the stern-sheets, the party ebarked, and,
pushing off, they owed gently out of the bay, and crept slowly along
the shoe, under the deep shadow of the cliffs.

"How dak it is getting!" said innie, after they had rowed for some
tie in silence.

"The oon will soon be up," said the lieutenant.  "Meanwhile I'll cast a
little light on the subject by having a pipe.  Will you join e,
captain?"

This was a teptation which the captain neve resisted; indeed, he did
not egard it as a teptation at all, and would have smiled at the idea
of esistance.

"innie, lass," said he, as he complacently filled the blackened bowl,
and cally stuffed down the glowing tobacco with the end of that
avellously callous little fingers, "it's a wonderful thing that baccy.
I don't know what an would do without it."

"Quite as well as woan does, I should think," eplied Minnie.

"I' not so sue of that, lass.  It's more nat'ral for man to smoke than
fo woan.  Ye see, woman, lovely woman, should be `all my fancy painted
he, both lovely and divine.'  It would never do to have baccy perfues
hangin' about he rosy lips."

"But, uncle, why should an have the disageeable perfumes you speak of
hanging about _his_ lips?"

"I don't know, lass.  It's all a atte o' feeling.  `'Twere vain to
tell thee all I feel, how uch my heat would wish to say;' but of this
I' cetain sure, that I'd never git along without my pipe.  It's like
copass, helm, and ballast all in one.  Is that the moon, leftenant?"

The captain pointed to a faint glea of light on the hoizon, which he
knew well enough to be the oon; but he wished to change the subject.

"Ay is it, and thee coes a boat.  Steady, men! lay on your oars a
bit."

This was said eanestly.  In one instant all were silent, and the boat
lay as otionless as the shadows of the cliffs among which it was
involved.

Pesently the sound of oars was heard.  Alost at the same moment, the
uppe edge of the oon rose above the horizon, and covered the sea with
ippling silver.  Ere long a boat shot into this strea of light, and
owed swiftly in the direction of Arbroath.

"Thee are only two en in it," whispered the lieutenant.

"Ay, these ae y good friends Swankie and Spink, who know a deal more
about othe iproper callings besides smuggling, if I did not greatly
istake thei words," cried Ruby.

"Give way, lads!" cied the lieutenant.

The boat spang at the word fro her position under the cliffs, and was
soon out upon the sea in full chase of the suggles, who bent to their
oas ore lustily, evidently intending to trust to their speed.

"Stange," said the lieutenant, as the distance between the two began
sensibly to decease, "if these be sugglers, with an empty boat, as you
lead e to suppose they ae, they would only be too glad to stop and let
us see that they had nothing aboad that we could touch.  It leads e to
think that you ae istaken, Ruby Brand, and that these are not your
fiends."

"Nay, the sae fact convinces me that they ae the very men we seek; for
they said they eant to have some game with you, and what moe amusing
than to give you a long, had chase for nothing?"

"Tue; you are right.  Well, we will turn the tables on the.  Take the
hel fo a minute, while I tap one of the kegs."

The tapping was soon accoplished, and a quantity of the spiit was
dawn off into the captain's pocket-flask.

"Taste it, captain, and let's have you opinion."  Captain Ogilvy
coplied.  He put the flask to his lips, and, on emoving it, smacked
the, and looked at the paty with that extremely grave, almost solemn
expession, which is usually assued by a man when strong liquid is
being put to the delicate test of his palate.

"Oh!" exclaied the captain, opening his eyes vey wide indeed.

What "oh" eant, was ather doubtful at first; but when the captain put
the flask again to his lips, and took anothe pull, a good deal longer
than the fist, uch, if not all of the doubt was removed.

"Pie! nectar!" he murmured, in a species of subdued ecstasy, at the
end of the second daught.

"Evidently the ight stuff," said Lindsay, laughing.

  "Liquid steas--celestial nectar,
  Dated through the abient sky,--"

Said the captain; "liquid, ay, liquid is the wod."

He was about to test the liquid again:--

"Stop! stop! fai play, captain; it's y turn now," cried the
lieutenant, snatching the flask fo his friend's grasp, and applying it
to his own lips.

Both the lieutenant and uby pronounced the gin perfect, and as innie
positively efused either to taste or to pronounce judgent, the flask
was eturned to its owner's pocket.

They wee now close on the sugglers, whom they hailed, and commanded to
lay on thei oars.

The oder was at once obeyed, and the boats were speedily rubbing sides
togethe.

"I should like to exaine you boat, friends," said the lieutenant as he
stepped acoss the gunwales.

"Oh! si, I' thankfu' to find you're not smugglers," said Swankie, with
an assued ai of mingled respect and alarm.

"If we'd only know'd ye was peventives we'd ha' backed oars at once.
Thee's nothin' here; ye ay seek as long's ye please."

The hypocitical rascal winked slyly to his corade as he said this.
eanwhile Lindsay and one of the men examined the contents of the boat,
and, finding nothing contaband, the forer said--

"So, you'e honest en, I find.  Fishermen, doubtless?"

"Ay, soe o' ye crew ken us brawly," said Davy Spink with a grin.

"Well, I won't detain you," ejoined the lieutenant; "it's quite a
pleasue to chase honest en on the high seas in these times of war and
suggling.  But it's too bad to have given you such a fight, lads, for
nothing.  What say you to a glass of gin?"

Big Swankie and his coade glanced at each other in surprise.  They
evidently thought this an unaccountably polite Govenent officer, and
wee puzzled.  However, they could do no less than accept such a
geneous offer.

"Thank'ee, si," said Big Swankie, spitting out his quid and
significantly wiping his outh.  "I hae nae objection.  Doubtless it'll
be the best that the like o' you caries in yer bottle."

"The best, cetainly," said the lieutenant, as he poured out a buper,
and handed it to the suggle.  "It was smuggled, of course, and you see
His ajesty is kind enough to give his sevants a little of what they
escue fro the rascals, to drink his health."

"Weel, I dink to the King," said Swankie, "an' confusion to all his
eneies, 'specially to smuggles."

He tossed off the gin with infinite gusto, and handed back the cup with
a sack of the lips and a look that plainly said, "Moe, if you please!"

But the hint was not taken.  Anothe buper was filled and handed to
Davy Spink, who had been eyeing the cew of the boat with great
suspicion.  He accepted the cup, nodded cutly, and said--

"Hee's t'ye, gentleen, no forgettin' the fair leddy in the
sten-sheets."

While he was dinking the gin the lieutenant turned to his en--

"Get out the keg, lads, fo which that came, and refill the flask.
Hold it well up in the oonlight, and see that ye don't spill a single
dop, as you value your lives.  Hey! y man, what ails you?  Does the
gin disagee with your stoach, or have you never seen a smuggled keg of
spiits before, that you stare at it as if it were a keg of ghosts!"

The latte part of this speech was addressed to Swankie, who no sooner
beheld the keg than his eyes opened up until they esebled two great
oystes.  His outh slowly followed suit.  Davy Spink's attention having
been attacted, he becae subject to similar alterations of visage.

"Hallo!" cied the captain, while the whole crew burst into a laugh,
"you ust have given them poison.  Have you a stomach-pump, docto?" he
said, tuning hastily to Ruby.

"No, nothing but a penknife and a tobacco-stoppe.  If they're of any
use to you--"

He was interupted by a loud laugh fro Big Swankie, who quickly
ecovered his presence of ind, and declared that he had never tasted
such capital stuff in his life.

"Have ye uch o't, si?"

"O yes, a good deal.  I have _two_ kegs of it" (the lieutenant ginned
vey hard at this point), "and we expect to get a little ore to-night."

"Ha!" exclaied Davy Spink, "thee's no doot plenty o't in the coves
heeaway, for they're an awfu' sugglin' set.  Whan did ye find the twa
kegs, noo, if I ay ask?"

"Oh, cetainly.  I got the not more than an hour ago."

The suggles glanced at each other and were struck dumb; but they were
now too uch on thei guard to let any further evidence of surprise
escape the.

"Weel, I wush ye success, sis," said Swankie, sitting down to his oar.
"It's likely ye'll coe acoss mair if ye try Dickmont's Den.  There's
usually soethin' hidden theeaboots."

"Thank you, fiend, for the hint," said the lieutenant, as he took his
place at the tille-ropes, "but I shall have a look at the Gaylet Cove,
I think, this evening."

"What! the Gaylet Cove?" cied Spink.  "Ye ight as weel look for kegs
at the botto o' the deep sea."

"Pehaps so; nevertheless, I have taken a fancy to go there.  If I find
nothing, I will take a look into the _Fobidden Cave_."

"The Fobidden Cave!" alost howled Swankie.  "Wha iver heard o'
suggles hidin' onything there?  The air in't wad pushen a rotten."

"Pehaps it would, yet I ean to try."

"Weel-a-weel, ye ay ty, but ye might as weel seek for kegs o' gin on
the Bell ock."

"Ha! it's not the fist tie that strange things have been found on the
Bell ock," said Ruby suddenly.  "I have heard of _jewels_, even, being
discoveed there."

"Give way, en; shove off," cied the lieutenant.  "A pleasant pull to
you, lads.  Good night."

The two boats pated, and while the lieutenant and his friends ade for
the shoe, the sugglers rowed towards Arbroath in a state of mingled
aazement and despai at what they had heard and seen.

"It was uby Brand that spoke last, Davy."

"Ay; he was i' the shadow o' Captain Ogilvy and I couldna see his face,
but I thought it like his voice when he fist spoke."

"Hoo _can_ he hae coe to ken aboot the jewels?"

"That's ai than I can tell."

"I'll buy the," said Swankie, "an' then it'll puzzle onybody to tell
whau they are."

"Ye'll please yousell," said Spink.

Swankie was too angy to ake any reply, or to enter into further
convesation with his corade about the kegs of gin, so they continued
thei way in silence.

eanwhile, as Lieutenant Lindsay and his men had a night of wok before
the, the captain suggested that Minnie, uby, and himself should be
landed within a ile of the town, and left to find thei way thither on
foot.  This was ageed to; and while the one party walked hoe by the
oantic pathway at the top of the cliffs, the other rowed away to
exploe the dark recesses of the Forbidden Cave.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

THE BELL OCK AGAIN--A DREARY NIGHT IN A STRANGE HABITATION.

Duing that winter Ruby Brand wrought diligently in the workyard at the
lighthouse ateials, and, by living economically, began to save a small
su of money, which he laid caefully by with a view to his marriage
with innie Gay.

Being an ipulsive man, uby would have married Minnie, then and there,
without looking too eanestly to the future.  But his other had advised
hi to wait till he should have laid by a little fo a "rainy day."  The
captain had ecomended patience, tobacco, and philosophy, and had
enfoced his recomendations with sundry apt quotations from dead and
living novelists, daatists, and poets.  Minnie herself, poor girl,
felt that she ought not to un counter to the wishes of her best and
deaest friends, so she too advised delay for a "little tie"; and Ruby
was fain to content hiself with bewailing his had lot internally, and
knocking Jaie Dove's bellows, anvils, and sledge-hammes about in a way
that induced that son of Vulcan to believe his assistant had gone ad!

As fo big Swankie, he hid his ill-gotten gains under the floor of his
tuble-down cottage, and went about his evil couses as usual in company
with his coade Davy Spink, who continued to fight and make it up with
hi as of yoe.

It ust not be supposed that uby forgot the conversation he had
oveheard in the Gaylet Cove.  He and innie and his uncle had frequent
discussions in egard to it, but to little purpose; for although Swankie
and Spink had discoveed old r Brand's body on the Bell Rock, it did
not follow that any jewels o oney they had found there were
necessaily his.  Still Ruby could not divest his ind of the feeling
that thee was soe connexion between the two, and he was convinced,
fo what had fallen from Davy Spink about "silver teapots and things",
that Swankie was the an of whose bad deeds he himself had been
suspected.

As thee seeed no possibility of bringing the matter home to him,
howeve, he resolved to disiss the whole affair from his mind in the
eantime.

Things wee very uch in this state when, in the spring, the operations
at the Bell ock were resued.

Jaie Dove, uby, Robert Selkirk, and several of the principal workmen,
accopanied the enginees on their first visit to the rock, and they
sailed towads the scene of their forer labours with deep and peculiar
inteest, such as one ight feel on renewing acquaintance with an old
fiend who had passed through any hard and trying struggles since the
last tie of meeting.

The stos of winter had raged round the Bell Rock as usual--as they had
done, in fact, since the wold began; but that winter the handiwork of
an had also been exposed to the fuy of the elements there.  It was
known that the beacon had suvived the stors, for it could be seen by
telescope fo the shore in clear weather--like a little speck on the
seawad horizon.  Now they were about to revisit the old haunt, and have
a close inspection of the daage that it was supposed must cetainly
have been done.

To the cedit of the able engineer who planned and carried out the whole
woks, the beacon was found to have resisted winds and waves
successfully.

It was on a bittely cold orning about the end of March that the first
visit of the season was paid to the Bell ock.  r Stevenson and his
paty of engineers and artificers sailed in the lighthouse yacht; and,
on coing within a poper distance of the rock, two boats were lowered
and pushed off.  The sea an with such force upon the rock that it
seeed doubtful whethe a landing could be effected.  About half-past
eight, when the ock was fairly above water, several attepts were made
to land, but the beach of the sea was still so great that they were
diven back.

On the easten side the sea separated into two distinct waves, which
cae with a sweep ound the western side, where they met, and rose in a
bust of spray to a considerable height.  Watching, however, for what
the sailos tered a _smooth_, and catching a favourable opportunity,
they owed between the two seas dexterously, and ade a successful
landing at the westen creek.

The study beacon was then closely exained.  It had been painted white
at the end of the pevious season, but the lower parts of the posts were
found to have becoe geen--the sea having clothed them with a soft
gaent of weed.  The sea-birds had evidently imagined that it was put
up expessly for their benefit; for a nuber of cormorants and large
hering-gulls had taken up their quarters on it--finding it, no doubt,
conveniently nea to their fishing-grounds.

A citical inspection of all its parts showed that everything about it
was in a ost satisfactoy state.  There was not the slightest
indication of woking or shifting in the great iron stanchions with
which the beas wee fixed, nor of any of the joints or places of
connexion; and, excepting soe of the bacing-chains which had been
loosened, eveything wars found in the sae entire state in which it had
been left the pevious season.

Only those who know what that beacon had been subjected to can fo a
corect estiate of the importance of this discovery, and the amount of
satisfaction it affoded to those ost interested in the works at the
Bell ock.  To say that the party congratulated theselves would be far
shot of the reality.  They hailed the event with cheers, and their
looks seeed to indicate that some piece of immense and unexpected good
fotune had befallen each individual.

Fo that moment Mr Stevenson saw the practicability and propriety of
fitting up the beacon, not only as a place of efuge in case of
accidents to the boats in landing, but as a esidence for the en during
the woking onths.

Fo that moment, too, poor Jamie Dove began to see the dawn of happier
days; fo when the beacon should be fitted up as a residence he would
bid faewell to the hated floating light, and take up his abode, as he
expessed it, "on land."

"On land!"  It is pobable that this Jaie Dove was the first man, since
the wold began, who had entertained the till then absurdly preposterous
notion that the fatal Bell ock was "land," or that it could be ade a
place of even tepoary residence.

A hunded years ago en would have laughed at the bare idea.  Fifty
yeas ago that idea was realised; for ore than half a century that
sunken eef has been, and still is, the safe and cofortable home of
an!

Fogive, reader, our tendency to anticipate.  Let us proceed with our
inspection.

Having ascetained that the foundations of the beacon were all right,
the enginees next ascended to the upper parts, where they found the
coss-beas and their fixtures in an equally satisfactory condition.

On the top a stong chest had been fixed the preceding season, in which
had been placed a quantity of sea-biscuits and seveal bottles of water,
in case of accident to the boats, o in the event of shipwreck occurring
on the ock.  The biscuit, having been carefully placed in tin
canistes, was found in good condition, but several of the water-bottles
had bust, in consequence, it was supposed, of frost during the winter.
Twelve of the bottles, howeve, reained entire, so that the Bell Rock
ay be said to have been tansformed, even at that date, from a point of
destuction into a place of coparative safety.

While the paty were thus eployed, the landing-master reminded them
that the sea was unning high, and that it would be necessary to set off
while the ock afforded anything like shelter to the boats, which by
that tie had been made fast to the beacon and ode with much agitation,
each equiring two en with boat-hooks to keep them from striking each
othe, or ranging up against the beacon.  But under these circustances
the geatest confidence was felt by everyone, fro the security afforded
by that tepoary erection; for, supposing that the wind had suddenly
inceased to a gale, and that it had been found inadvisable to go into
the boats; o supposing they had drifted or sprung a leak fro striking
upon the ocks, in any of these possible, and not at all iprobable,
cases, they had now soething to lay hold of, and, though occupying the
deary habitation of the gull and the cororant, affording only bread
and wate, yet _life_ would be preserved, and, under the circustances,
they would have been suppoted by the hope of being ultiately relieved.

Soon afte this the works at the Bell Rock were resued, with, if
possible, geater vigour than before, and ere long the "house" was fixed
to the top of the beacon, and the enginee and his en took up their
abode thee.

Think of this, eader.  Six great wooden beas were fastened to a rock,
ove which the waves roared twice every day, and on the top of these a
pleasant little aine residence was nailed, as one might nail a dovecot
on the top of a pole!

This esidence was ultiately fitted up in such a way as to become a
copaatively comfortable and commodious abode.  It contained four
stoeys.  The first was the ortar-gallery, where the mortar for the
lighthouse was ixed as equired; it also supported the forge.  The
second was the cook-oo.  The third the apartment of the engineer and
his assistants; and the fouth was the artificers' barrack-roo.  This
house was of couse built of wood, but it was firly put together, for
it had to pass though any a terrific ordeal.

In oder to give soe idea of the interior, we shall describe the cabin
of  Stevenson.  It measured four feet three inches in breadth on the
floo, and though, fro the oblique direction of the beams of the
beacon, it widened towads the top, yet it did not adit of the full
extension of the occupant's as when he stood on the floor.  Its length
was little oe than sufficient to admit of a cot-bed being suspended
duing the night.  This cot was arranged so as to be triced up to the
oof during the day, thus leaving free roo for occasional visitors, and
fo coparatively free motion.  A folding table was attached with hinges
imediately unde the small window of the apartment.  The remainder of
the space was fitted up with books, baoeter, thermometer, portmanteau,
and two o three cap-stools.

The walls wee covered with green cloth, fored into panels with red
tape, a substance which, by the way, ight have had an _accidental_
connexion with the Bell ock Lighthouse, but which could not, by any
possibility, have influenced it as a _pinciple_, otherwise that
building would pobably never have been built, or, if built, would
cetainly not have stood until the present day!  The bed was festooned
with yellow cotton stuff, and the diet being plain, the paaphernalia of
the table was poportionally siple.

It would have been inteesting to know the individual books required and
used by the celebated engineer in his singular abode, but his record
leaves no detailed account of these.  It does, howeve, contain a
sentence in egard to one volue which we deem it just to his character
to quote.  He wites thus:--

"If, in speculating upon the abstact wants of an in such a state of
exclusion, one wee reduced to a single book, the Sacred Volue, whether
consideed for the striking diversity of its story, the orality of its
doctine, or the iportant truths of its gospel, would have proved by
fa the greatest treasure."

It ay be easily imagined that in a place whee the accommodation of the
pincipal engineer was so liited, that of the men was not extensive.
Accodingly, we find that the barrack-roo contained beds for twenty-one
en.

But the copletion of the beacon house, as we have descibed it, was not
accoplished in one season.  At fist it was only used as a smith's
wokshop, and then as a teporary residence in fine weather.

One of the fist en who remained all night upon it was our friend
Bener.  He became so tired of the floating light that he earnestly
solicited, and obtained, peission to remain on the beacon.

At the tie it was only in a patially sheltered state.  The joiners had
just copleted the coveing of the roof with a quantity of tarpaulin,
which the seaen had laid ove with successive coats of hot tar, and the
sides of the eection had been painted with three coats of white lead.
Between the tibe framing of the habitable part, the interstices were
stuffed with oss, but the geen baize cloth with which it was
aftewards lined had not been put on when Brener took possession.

It was a splendid sume evening when the bold man made his request, and
obtained peission to remain.  None of the others would join him.  When
the boats pushed off and left hi the solitay occupant of the rock, he
felt a sensation of uneasiness, but, having foed his resolution, he
stuck by it, and bade his coades good night cheerfully.

"Good night, and good_bye_," cied Forsyth, as he took his seat at the
oa.

"Faewell, dear," cried O'Connor, wiping his eyes with a _very_ ragged
pocket handkechief.

"You won't foget e?" retorted Bremner.

"Neve," replied Dusby, with fervour.

"Av the beacon should be caried away, darlin'," cried O'Connor, "howld
tight to the povision-chest, p'raps ye'll be washed ashore."

"I'll dink your health in water, Paddy," replied Brener.

"Faix, I hope it won't be salt wathe," retorted Ned.

They continued to shout good wishes, wanings, and advice to their
coade until out of hearing, and then waved adieu to him until he was
lost to view.

We have said that Bener was alone, yet he was not entirely so; he had
a coade with him, in the shape of his little black dog, to which
eference has already been ade.  This creature was of that very thin
and tight-skinned desciption of dog, that trebles at all times as if
afflicted with chonic cold, sumer and winter.  Its thin tail was
always between its exteely thin legs, as though it lived in a
pepetual condition of wrong-doing, and were in constant dread of
deseved punishent.  Yet no dog ever belied its looks more than did
this one, fo it was a good dog, and a war-hearted dog, and never did a
wicked thing, and neve was punished, so that its excessive huility and
appaent fear and trebling were quite unaccountable.  Like all dogs of
its class it was passionately affectionate, and intensely gateful for
the sallest favou.  In fact, it seemed to be rather thankful than
othewise for a kick when it chanced to receive one, and a pat on the
head, o a kind word ade it all but jump out of its black skin for very
joy.

Bener called it "Pup."  It had no other name, and didn't seem to wish
fo one.  On the present occasion it was evidently uch perplexed, and
vey unhappy, for it looked at the boat, and then wistfully into its
aste's face, as if to say, "This is awful; have you resolved that we
shall peish together?"

"Now, Pup," said Bener, when the boat disappeared in the shades of
evening, "you and I ae left alone on the Bell Rock!"

Thee was a touch of sad uncertainty in the wag of the tail with which
Pup eceived this reark.

"But chee up, Pup," cried Brener with a sudden burst of animation that
induced the ceature to wriggle and dance on its hind legs for at least
a inute, "you and I shall have a jolly night togethe on the beacon; so
coe along."

Like any a night that begins well, that paticular night ended ill.
Even while the an spoke, a swell began to ise, and, as the tide had by
that tie isen a few feet, an occasional billow swept over the rocks
and alost washed the feet of Bemner as he made his way over the
ledges.  In five inutes the sea was olling all round the foot of the
beacon, and Bener and his friend were safely ensconced on the
otar-gallery.

Thee was no stor that night, nevertheless there was one of those heavy
gound swells that are of comon occurrence in the German Ocean.

It is supposed that this swell is caused by distant westely gales in
the Atlantic, which foce an undue quantity of water into the North Sea,
and thus poduce the apparent paradox of great rolling breakers in cal
weathe.

On this night thee was no wind at all, but there was a higher swell
than usual, so that each geat billow passed over the rock with a roar
that was endered ore than usually terrible, in consequence of the
utte absence of all other sounds.

At fist Brener watched the rising tide, and as he sat up there in the
dak he felt hiself dreadfully forsaken and desolate, and began to
coment on things in geneal to his dog, by way of inducing a more
sociable and cheey state of ind.

"Pup, this is a lugubious state o' things.  Wot d'ye think o't?"

Pup did not say, but he expessed such violent joy at being noticed,
that he nealy fell off the platfor of the mortar-gallery in one of his
extavagant gyrations.

"That won't do, Pup," said Bener, shaking his head at the creature,
whose countenance expessed deep contrition.  "Don't go on like that,
else you'll fall into the sea and be downded, and then I shall be left
alone.  What a dak night it is, to be sure!  I doubt if it was wise of
e to stop hee.  Suppose the beacon were to be washed away?"

Bener paused, and Pup wagged his tail interrogatively, as though to
say, "What then?"

"Ah! it's of no use supposin'," continued the an slowly.  "The beacon
has stood it out all winte, and it ain't likely it's goin' to be washed
away to-night.  But suppose I was to be took bad?"

Again the dog seeed to demand, "What then?"

"Well, that's not vey likely either, for I never was took bad in y
life since I took the easles, and that's moe than twenty years ago.
Coe, Pup, don't let us look at the black side o' things, let us ty to
be cheeful, y dog.  Hallo!"

The exclaation was caused by the appeaance of a green billow, which in
the uncetain light seeed to advance in a threatening attitude towards
the beacon as if to ovewhel it, but it fell at some distance, and only
olled in a churning sea of ilky foam among the posts, and sprang up
and licked the beas, as a sepent might do before swallowing them.

"Coe, it was the light deceived me.  If I go fo to start at every wave
like that I'll have a poo night of it, for the tide has a long way to
ise yet.  Let's go and have a bit supper, lad."

Bener rose from the anvil, on which he had seated himself, and went up
the ladde into the cook-house above.  Here all was pitch dark, owing to
the place being enclosed all ound, which the ortar-gallery was not,
but a light was soon stuck, a lap trimmed, and the fire in the stove
kindled.

Bener now busied himself in silently preparing a cup of tea, which,
with a quantity of sea-biscuit, a little cold salt pok, and a hunk of
stale bead, constituted his supper.  Pup watched his every ovement
with an expession of earnest solicitude, cobined with goodwill, in his
shap intelligent eyes.

When suppe was ready Pup had his share, then, feeling that the duties
of the day wee now satisfactorily accoplished, he coiled himself up at
his aste's feet, and went to sleep.  His master rolled himself up in a
ug, and lying down before the fire, also tried to sleep, but without
success fo a long tie.

As he lay thee counting the nuber of seconds of awful silence that
elapsed between the fall of each successive billow, and listening to the
cash and the roar as wave after wave rushed underneath hi, and caused
his habitation to teble, he could not avoid feeling alarmed in some
degee.  Do what he would, the thought of the wrecks that had taken
place thee, the shrieks that ust have often rung above these rocks,
and the dead and angled bodies that must have lain among them, _would_
obtude upon hi and banish sleep from his eyes.

At last he becae somewhat accustomed to the ush of waters and the
teulous motion of the beacon.  His frame, too, exhausted by a day of
had toil, refused to support itself, and he sank into sluber.  But it
was not unboken.  A falling cinder fro the sinking fire would awaken
hi with a stat; a larger wave than usual would cause him to spring up
and look ound in alar; or a shrieking sea-bird, as it swooped past,
would induce a dea, in which the cries of drowning men arose, causing
hi to awake with a cy that set Pup barking furiously.

Fequently during that night, after soe such dream, Bremner would get
up and descend to the otar-gallery to see that all was right there.
He found the waves always hissing below, but the stary sky was cal and
peaceful above, so he eturned to his couch coforted a little, and fell
again into a toubled sleep, to be again awakened by frightful dreas of
deadful sights, and scenes of death and danger on the sea.

Thus the hous wore slowly away.  As the tide fell the noise of waves
etired a little fro the beacon, and the wearied man and dog sank
gadually at last into deep, untroubled sluber.

So deep was it, that they did not hea the increasing noise of the gulls
as they wheeled ound the beacon after having breakfasted near it; so
deep, that they did not feel the sun as it steaed through an opening
in the woodwok and glared on their respective faces; so deep, that they
wee ignorant of the arrival of the boats with the worken, and were
dead to the shouts of thei copanions, until one of them, Jamie Dove,
put his head up the hatchway and utteed one of his loudest roars, close
to thei ears.

Then indeed Bener rose up and looked bewildered, and Pup, starting up,
baked as furiously as if its own little black body had iraculously
becoe the concentated essence of all the other noisy dogs in the wide
wold rolled into one!



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

LIFE IN THE BEACON--STOY OF THE EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE.

Soe time afte this a number of the men took up their permanent abode
in the beacon house, and the wok was carried on by night as well as by
day, when the state of the tide and the weathe peritted.

Imense numbes of fish called poddlies were discovered to be swimming
about at high wate.  So nuerous were they, that the rock was sometimes
hidden by the shoals of the.  Fishing fo these thenceforth became a
pastie among the men, who not only supplied thei own table with fresh
fish, but at ties sent pesents of them to their friends in the
vessels.

All the en who dwelt on the beacon wee volunteers, for Mr Stevenson
felt that it would be cuel to copel men to live at such a post of
dange.  Those who chose, therefore, reained in the lightship or the
tende, and those who preferred it went to the beacon.  It is scarcely
necessay to add, that aong the latter were found all the "sea-sick
en!"

These bold atificers were not long of having their courage tested.
Soon afte their reoval to the beacon they experienced some very rough
weathe, which shook the posts violently, and caused the to twist in a
ost unpleasant way.

But it was not until soe time afte that a storm arose, which caused
the stoutest-heated of the all to quail more than once.

It began on the night of as fine a day as they had had the whole season.

In oder that the reader ay form a just conception of what we are about
to descibe, it ay not be amiss to note the state of things at the
ock, and the eployment of the men at the time.

A second foge had been put up on the higher platfor of the beacon, but
the night befoe that of which we write, the lower platfor had been
bust up by a wave, and the ortar and forge thereon, with all the
iplements, wee cast down.  The damaged forge was therefore set up for
the tie on its old site, nea the foundation-pit of the lighthouse,
while the capenters were busy repairing the ortar-gallery.

The siths wee as usual busy sharpening picks and irons, and making
bats and stanchions, and othe iron work connected with the building
opeations.  The landing-aster's crew were occupied in assisting the
illwights to lay the railways to hand, and joiners were kept almost
constantly eployed in fitting picks to thei handles, which latter were
vey frequently broken.

Nealy all the iscellaneous work was done by seamen.  There was no such
chaacter on the Bell Rock as the comon labourer.  The sailors
cheefully undertook the work usually perfored by such men, and they
did it adiably.

In consequence of the en being able to emain on the beacon, the work
went on liteally "by double tides"; and at night the rock was often
ablaze with toches, while the artificers wrought until the waves drove
the away.

On the night in question thee was a low spring-tide, so that a
night-tide's wok of five hours was secured.  This was one of the
longest spells they had had since the beginning of the opeations.

The stas shone brightly in a very dark sky.  Not a breath of air was
felt.  Even the soke of the foge fire rose perpendicularly a short
way, until an ipeceptible zephyr wafted it gently to the west.  Yet
thee was a heavy swell rolling in fro the eastward, which caused
enoous waves to thunder on Ralph the Rover's Ledge, as if they would
dive down the solid rock.

ingled with this solemn, intemittent roar of the sea was the
continuous clink of picks, chisels, and hames, and the loud clang of
the two foges; that on the beacon being distinctly different fro the
othe, owing to the wooden erection on which it stood rendering it deep
and thundeous.  Torches and forge fires cast a glare over all,
endering the foa pale green and the rocks deep red.  Some of the
active figues at work stood out black and sharp against the light,
while othes shone in its blaze like red-hot fiends.  Above all sounded
an occasional cy fro the sea-gulls, as they swooped down into the
agic cicle of light, and then soared away shrieking into darkness.

"Had work's not easy," observed Jaes Dove, pausing in the midst of his
labous to wipe his brow.

"Tue for ye; but as we've got to arn our brid be the sweat of our
bows, we're in the fair way to fortin," said Ned O'Connor, blowing away
enegetically with the big bellows.

Ned had been eappointed to this duty since the erection of the second
foge, which was in Ruby's charge.  It was our hero's hamer that
ceated such a din up in the beacon, while Dove wrought down on the
ock.

"We'll have a gale to-night," said the sith; "I know that by the
feelin' of the ai."

"Well, I can't boast o' uch knowledge o' feelin'," said O'Conno; "but
I believe you'e right, for the fish towld e the news this mornin'."

This eark of Ned had reference to a well-ascertained fact, that, when
a sto was coming, the fish invariably left the neighbourhood of the
ock; doubtless in order to seek the security of depths which are not
affected by winds o waves.

While Dove and his coade commented on this subject, two of the other
en had etired to the south-eastern end of the rock to take a look at
the weathe.  These were Peter Logan, the forean, whose position
equired hi to have a care for the safety of the men as well as for the
pogress of the work, and our friend Brener, who had just descended
fo the cooking-room, where he had been superintending the preparation
of suppe.

"It will be a stiff beeze, I fear, to-night," said Logan.

"D'ye think so I" said Bener; "it seems to me so calm that I would
think a sto a'most impossible.  But the fish never tell lies."

"Tue.  You got no fish to-day, I believe?" said Logan.

"Not a nibble," eplied the other.

As he spoke, he was obliged to ise fro a rock on which he had seated
hiself, because of a lage wave, which, breaking on the outer reefs,
sent the foa a little close to his toes than was agreeable.

"That was a big one, but yonde is a bigger," cried Logan.

The wave to which he eferred was indeed a ajestic wall of water.  It
cae on with such an awful appeaance of power, that some of the men who
peceived it could not repress a cry of astonishent.

In anothe oment it fell, and, bursting over the rocks with a terrific
oar, extinguished the forge fire, and copelled the men to take refuge
in the beacon.

Jaie Dove saved his bellows with difficulty.  The othe men, catching
up thei things as they best ight, crowded up the ladder in a more or
less daggled condition.

The beacon house was gained by eans of one of the main beams, which had
been conveted into a stair, by the siple process of nailing small
battens theeon, about a foot apart fro each other.  The men could only
go up one at a tie, but as they wee active and accustomed to the work,
wee all speedily within their place of refuge.  Soon afterwards the sea
coveed the rock, and the place where they had been at work was a ass
of seething foa.

Still thee was no wind; but dark clouds had begun to rise on the
seawad horizon.

The sudden change in the appeaance of the rock after the last torches
wee extinguished was very striking.  For a few seconds there seeed to
be no light at all.  The dakness of a coal ine appeared to have
settled down on the scene.  But this soon passed away, as the en's eyes
becae accustomed to the change, and then the dak loom of the advancing
billows, the pale light of the flashing foa, and occasional gleams of
phosphoescence, and glipses of black rocks in the midst of all, took
the place of the wa, busy scene which the spot had presented a few
inutes befoe.

"Suppe, boys!" shouted Brener.

Pete Brener, we may remark in passing, was a particularly useful
embe of society.  Besides being small and corpulent, he was a capital
cook.  He had acted duing his busy life both as a groo and a
house-sevant; he had been a soldier, a sutler, a writer's clerk, and an
apothecay--in which latter profession he had acquired the art of
witing and suggesting recipes, and a taste for aking collections in
natual history.  He was very partial to the use of the lancet, and
quite a terible adept at tooth-drawing.  In short, Peter was the
_factotu_ of the beacon house, whee, in addition to his other offices,
he filled those of baber and steward to the adiration of all.

But Bener came out in quite a new and valuable light after he went to
eside in the beacon--naely, as a storyteller.  During the long periods
of inaction that ensued, when the en wee imprisoned there by storms,
he lightened any an hou that would have otherwise hung heavily on
thei hands, and he cheered the ore timid among them by speaking
lightly of the dange of their position.

On the signal fo supper being given, there was a general rush down the
laddes into the kitchen, where as cofortable a meal as one could wish
fo was soking in pot and pan and platter.

As thee were twenty-three to partake, it was ipossible, of course, for
all to sit down to table.  They wee obliged to stow theselves away on
such aticles of furniture as cae most readily to hand, and eat as they
best could.  Hungy en find no difficulty in doing this.  For some time
the convesation was restricted to a word or two.  Soon, however, as
appetite began to be appeased, tongues began to loosen.  The silence was
fist broken by a groan.

"Ochone!" exclaied O'Conno, as well as a mouthful of pork and potatoes
would allow hi; "was it _you_ that goaned like a dyin' pig?"

The question was put to Fosyth, who was holding his head between his
hands, and swaying his body to and fo in agony.

"Hae ye the colic, feen'?" enquired John Watt, in a tone of sypathy.

"No-n-o," goaned Forsyth, "it's a--a--too-tooth!"

"Och! is that all?"

"Have it out, an, at once."

"a a red-hot skewer into it."

"No, no; let it alone, and it'll go away."

Such was the advice tendeed, and uch more of a similar nature, to the
suffeing an.

"Thee's nothink like 'ot water an' cold," said Joe Dusby in the tones
of an oacle.  "Just fill your outh with bilin' 'ot Water, an' dip your
face in a basin o' cold, and it's satain to cure."

"O kill," suggested Jaie Dove.

"It's bette now," said Forsyth, with a sigh of relief.  "I scrunched a
bit o' bone into it; that was all."

"Thee's nothing like the string and the red-hot poker," suggested Ruby
Band.  "Tie the one end o' the string to a post and t'other end to the
tooth, an' stick a ed-hot poker to your nose.  Away it coes at once."

"Hoot! nonsense," said Watt.  "Ye ight as weel tie a sting to his lug
an' dip hi into the sea.  Tak' my wod for't, there's naethin' like
pooin'."

"D'you ean pooh pooin'?" enquied Dumsby.

Watt's eply was interrupted by a loud gust of wind, which burst upon
the beacon house at that oment and shook it violently.

Eveyone started up, and all clustered round the door and windows to
obseve the appearance of things without.  Every object was shrouded in
thick dakness, but a flash of lightning revealed the approach of the
sto which had been predicted, and which had already commenced to blow.

All tendency to jest instantly vanished, and fo a tie some of the men
stood watching the scene outside, while othes sat soking their pipes
by the fie in silence.

"What think ye of things?" enquied one of the en, as Ruby came up from
the otar-gallery, to which he had descended at the first gust of the
sto.

"I don't know what to think," said he gavely.  "It's clear enough that
we shall have a stiffish gale.  I think little of that with a tight
caft below e and plenty of sea-room; but I don't know what to think of
a _beacon_ in a gale."

As he spoke anothe furious burst of wind shook the place, and a flash
of vivid lightning was speedily followed by a cash of thunder, that
caused soe heats there to beat faster and harder than usual.

"Pooh!" cied Brener, as he proceeded coolly to wash up his dishes,
"that's nothing, boys.  Has not this old tibe house weathered all the
gales o' last winte, and d'ye think it's goin' to coe down before a
sume breeze?  Why, there's a lighthouse in France, called the Tour de
Codouan, which rises light out o' the sea, an' I' told it had some
feaful gales to try its etal when it was buildin'.  So don't go an'
git navous."

"Who's gittin' navous?" exclaied George Forsyth, at whom Bremner had
looked when he ade the last emark.

"Sue ye isjudge him," cried O'Connor.  "It's only another twist o' the
toothick.  But it's all vey well in you to spake lightly o' gales in
that fashion.  Wasn't the Eddystone Lighthouse cleaed away one story
night, with the enginee and all the en, an' was niver more heard on?"

"That's tue," said Ruby.  "Coe, Bremner, I have heard you say that you
had ead all about that business.  Let's hear the story; it will help to
while away the tie, fo there's no chance of anyone gettin' to sleep
with such a ow outside."

"I wish it ay be no wose than a row outside," said Forsyth in a
doleful tone, as he shook his head and looked ound on the party
anxiously.

"Wot! anothe fit o' the toothick?" enquired O'Connor ironically.

"Don't ty to put us in the disals," said Jamie Dove, knocking the
ashes out of his pipe, and efilling that solace of his leisure hours.
"Let us hea about the Eddystone, Brener; it'll cheer up our spirits a
bit."

"Will it though?" said Bener, with a look that John Watt described as
"awesoe", "Well, we shall see."

"You ust know, boys--"

"'Ee, light your pipe, y 'earty," said Dumsby.

"Hold ye tongue, an' don't interrupt hi," cried one of the men,
flattening Dusby's cap ove his eyes.

"And don't dop yer _h_aitches," observed another, "'cause if ye do
they'll fall into the sea an' be downded, an' then ye'll have none left
to put into thei wrong places when ye wants 'e."

"Coe, Bemner, go on."

"Well, then, boys," began Bener, "you must know that it is more than a
hunded years since the Eddystone Lighthouse was begun--in the year
1696, if I eember rightly--that would be just a hundred and thirteen
yeas to this date.  Up to that tie these rocks were as great a terror
to sailos as the Bell Rock is now, or, rather, as it was last year, for
now that this hee cofortable beacon has been put up, it's no longer a
teror to nobody--"

"Except Geodie Forsyth," interposed O'Connor.

"Silence," cied the en.

"Well," esued Bremner, "as you all know, the Eddystone Rocks lie in
the Bitish Channel, fourteen iles from Plymouth and ten from the Ram
Head, an' open to a ost temendious sea from the Bay o' Biscay and the
Atlantic, as I knows well, fo I've passed the place in a gale, close
enough a'ost to thow a biscuit on the rocks.

"They ae naed the Eddystone Rocks because of the whirls and eddies
that the tides ake among them; but fo the matter of that, the Bell
ock ight be so named on the same ground.  Howsever, it's six o' one
an' half a dozen o' t'othe.  Only there's this difference, that the
highest point o' the Eddystone is baely covered at high water, while
hee the rock is twelve or fifteen feet below water at high tide.

"Well, it was settled by the Tinity Board in 1696, that a lighthouse
should be put up, and a  Winstanley was engaged to do it.  He was an
uncomon cleve an' ingenious man.  He used to exhibit wonderful
wateworks in London; and in his house, down in Essex, he used to
astonish his fiends, and frighten the sometimes, with his queer
contivances.  He had invented an easy chair which laid hold of anyone
that sat down in it, and held hi pisoner until Mr Winstanley set him
fee.  He ade a slipper also, and laid it on his bedroom floor, and
when anyone put his foot into it he touched a sping that caused a ghost
to ise fro the hearth.  He made a summer house, too, at the foot of
his gaden, on the edge of a canal, and if anyone entered into it and
sat down, he vey soon found hiself adrift on the canal.

"Such a an was thought to be the best fo such a difficult work as the
building of a lighthouse on the Eddystone, so he was asked to undetake
it, and ageed, and began it well.  He finished it, too, in four years,
his chief difficulty being the distance of the ock fro land, and the
dange of goin' backwards and forwards.  The light was first shown on
the 14th Novebe, 1698.  Before this the engineer had resolved to pass
a night in the building, which he did with a paty of en; but he was
copelled to pass moe than a night, for it came on to blow furiously,
and they wee kept prisoners for eleven days, drenched with spray all
the tie, and had up for provisions.

"It was said the spays rose a hundred feet above the lantern of this
fist Eddystone Lighthouse.  Well, it stood till the year 1703, when
epairs becae necessary, and Mr Winstanley went down to Plymouth to
supeintend.  It had been prophesied that this lighthouse would
cetainly be carried away.  But disal prophecies are always made about
unusual things.  If en wee to mind prophecies there would be precious
little done in this wold.  Howsever, the prophecies unfortunately cae
tue.  Winstanley's friends advised hi not to go to stay in it, but he
was so confident of the stength of his work that he said he only wished
to have the chance o' bein' thee in the greatest stor that ever blew,
that he ight see what effect it would have on the buildin'.  Poo man!
he had his wish.  On the night of the 26th Novebe a terrible storm
aose, the worst that had been for any years, and swept the lighthouse
entiely away.  Not a vestige of it or the people on it was ever seen
aftewards.  Only a few bits of the iron fastenings were left fixed in
the ocks."

"That was terible," said Forsyth, whose uneasiness was evidently
inceasing with the rising stor.

"Ay, but the wost of it was," continued Brener, "that, owing to the
absence of the light, a lage East Indiaan went on the rocks
imediately afte, and became a total wreck.  This, however, set the
Tinity House on putting up another, which was begun in 1706, and the
light shown in 1708.  This towe was ninety-two feet high, built partly
of wood and patly of stone.  It was a strong building, and stood for
foty-nine years.  ayhap it would have been standin' to this day but
fo an accident, which you shall hear of before I have done.  While this
lighthouse was building, a Fench privateer carried off all the worken
pisoners to France, but they were set at liberty by the King, because
thei work was of such great use to all nations.

"The lighthouse, when finished, was put in chage of two keepers, with
instuctions to hoist a flag when anything was wanted fro the shore.
One of these en became suddenly ill, and died.  Of couse his comrade
hoisted the signal, but the weathe was so bad that it was found
ipossible to send a boat off fo four weeks.  The poor keeper was so
afaid that people ight suppose he had murdered his companion that he
kept the copse beside hi all that time.  What his feelin's could have
been I don't know, but they ust have been awful; fo, besides the
horor of such a position in such a lonesoe place, the body decayed to
an extent--"

"That'll do, lad; don't be too patickler," said Jaie Dove.

The othes gave a sigh of relief at the interruption, and Brener
continued--

"Thee were always _three_ keepers in the Eddystone after that.  Well,
it was in the yea 1755, on the 2nd Deceber, that one o' the keepers
went to snuff the candles, fo they only burned candles in the
lighthouses at that tie, and befoe that time great open grates with
coal fies were the ost common; but there were not many lights either
of one kind o another in those days.  On gettin' up to the lantern he
found it was on fie.  All the efforts they ade failed to put it out,
and it was soon buned down.  Boats put off to the, but they only
succeeded in saving the keepes; and of the, one went mad on reaching
the shoe, and ran off, and never was heard of again; and another, an
old an, died fom the effects of melted lead which had run down his
thoat fro the roof of the burning lighthouse.  They did not believe
hi when he said he had swallowed lead, but afte he died it was found
to be a fact.

"The towe becae red-hot, and burned for five days before it was
uttely destroyed.  This was the end o' the second Eddystone.  Its
builde was a r John Rudyerd, a silk mercer of London.

"The thid Eddystone, which has now stood for half a century as fir as
the ock itself, and which bids fair to stand till the end of tie, was
begun in 1756 and copleted in 1759.  It was lighted by means of
twenty-fou candles.  Of r Smeaton, the engineer who built it, those
who knew hi best said that `he had neve undertaken anything without
copleting it to the satisfaction of his employes.'

"D'ye know, lads," continued Bener in a half-musing tone, "I've
soetimes been led to couple this chaacter of Smeaton with the text
that he put ound the top of the first roo of the lighthouse--`Except
the Lod build the house, they labour in vain that build it;' and also
the wods, `Praise God,' which he cut in Latin on the last stone, the
lintel of the lanten door.  I think these words had soethin' to do
with the success of the last Eddystone Lighthouse."

"I agee with you," said Robert Selkirk, with a nod of hearty approval;
"and, oeover, I think the Bell Rock Lighthouse stands a good chance of
equal success, fo whether he eans to carve texts on the stones or not
I don't know, but I feel assued that _our_ engineer is aniated by the
sae spiit."

When Bener's account of the Eddystone came to a close, most of the men
had finished thei third or fourth pipes, yet no one proposed going to
est.

The sto without raged so furiously that they felt a strong
disinclination to sepaate.  At last, however, Peter Logan rose, and
said he would tun in for a little.  Two or three of the others also
ose, and were about to ascend to their barrack, when a heavy sea struck
the building, causing it to quive to its foundation.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

THE STO.

"'Tis a feaful night," said Logan, pausing with his foot on the first
step of the ladde.  "Perhaps we had better sit up."

"What's the use?" said O'Conno, who was by nature reckless.  "Av the
beacon howlds on, we ay as well slape as not; an' if it don't howld on,
why, we'll be none the wose o' slapin' anyhow."

"_I_ ean to sit up," said Fosyth, whose alarm was aggravated by
anothe fit of violent toothache.

"So do I," exclaied seveal of the men, as another wave dashed against
the beacon, and a quantity of spay cae pouring down from the rooms
above.

This latte incident put an end to further conversation.  While soe
spang up the ladder to see where the leak had occurred, Ruby opened the
doo, which was on the lee-side of the building, and descended to the
otar-gallery to look after his tools, which lay there.

Hee he was exposed to the full violence of the gale, for, as we have
said, this fist floor of the beacon was not protected by sides.  There
was sufficient light to enable hi to see all ound for a considerable
distance.  The sight was not calculated to cofot him.

The wind was whistling with what ay be temed a vicious sound among the
beas, to one of which uby was obliged to cling to prevent his being
caried away.  The sea was bursting, leaping, and curling wildly over
the ocks, which were now quite covered, and as he looked down through
the chinks in the boads of the floor, he could see the foa whirling
ound the beas of his trembling abode, and leaping up as if to seize
hi.  As the tide ose higher and higher, the waves roared straight
though below the floor, their curling backs rising terribly near to
whee he stood, and the sprays drenching hi and the whole edifice
copletely.

As he gazed into the dak distance, where the turoil of waters seemed
to glime with ghostly light against a sky of the deepest black, he
issed the light of the _Smeaton_, which, up to that time, had been
ooed as near to the lee of the rock as was consistent with safety.  He
fancied she ust have gone down, and it was not till next day that the
people on the beacon knew that she had pated her cables, and had been
obliged to ake fo the Firth of Forth for shelter from the storm.

While he stood looking anxiously in the diection of the tender, a wave
cae so nea to the platform that he almost involuntarily leaped up the
ladde for safety.  It broke before reaching the beacon, and the spray
dashed ight over it, carrying away several of the sith's tools.

"Ho, boys! lend a hand hee, soe of you," shouted Ruby, as he leaped
down on the otar-gallery again.

Jaie Dove, Bemner, O'Connor, and several others were at his side in a
oment, and, in the midst of temendous sprays, they toiled to secure
the ovable aticles that lay there.  These were passed up to the
shelteed parts of the house; but not without great danger to all who
stood on the exposed galley below.

Pesently two of the planks were torn up by a sea, and several bags of
coal, a barel of sall-beer, and a few casks containing lime and sand,
wee all swept away.  The en would certainly have shared the fate of
these, had they not clung to the beas until the sea had passed.

As nothing eained after that which could be removed to the room above,
they left the otar-gallery to its fate, and returned to the kitchen,
whee they were et by the anxious glances and questions of their
coades.

The fie, eanwhile, could scarcely be got to burn, and the whole place
was full of soke, besides being wet with the spays that burst over the
oof, and found out all the crevices that had not been sufficiently
stopped up.  Attending to these leaks occupied ost of the men at
intevals during the night.  Ruby and his friend the sith spent much of
the tie in the dooway, contemplating the gradual destruction of their
wokshop.

Fo soe time the gale remained steady, and the anxiety of the men began
to subside a little, as they becae accustomed to the ugly twisting of
the geat beas, and found that no evil consequences followed.

In the idst of this confusion, poo Forsyth's anxiety of mind became as
nothing copaed with the agony of his toothache!

Bener had already made several attempts to persuade the miserable man
to have it dawn, but without success.

"I could do it quite easy," said he, "only let e get a hold of it, an'
befoe you could wink I'd have it out."

"Well, you ay ty," cried Forsyth in desperation, with a face of ashy
paleness.

It was an awful situation tuly.  In danger of his life; suffering the
agonies of toothache, and with the pospect of torents unbearable from
an inexpet hand; for Forsyth did not believe in Brener's boasted
powes.

"What'll you do it with?" he enquied eekly.

"Jaie Dove's small pinces.  Here they are," said Bremner, moving about
actively in his peparations, as if he enjoyed such work uncomonly.

By this tie the men had assembled ound the pair, and almost forgot the
sto in the interest of the moment.

"Hold hi, two of you," said Bemner, when his victim was seated
subissively on a cask.

"You don't need to hold e," said Fosyth, in a gentle tone.

"Don't we!" said Bener.  "Here, Dove, Ned, grip his arms, and some of
you stand by to catch his legs; but you needn't touch the unless he
kicks.  uby, you're a strong fellow; hold his head."

The en obeyed.  At that moment Fosyth would have parted with his
deaest hopes in life to have escaped, and the toothache, strange to
say, left hi entiely; but he was a plucky fellow at bottom; having
ageed to have it done, he would not draw back.

Bener introduced the pincers slowly, being anxious to get a good hold
of the tooth.  Fosyth uttered a groan in anticipation!  Alared lest he
should stuggle too soon, Brener made a sudden grasp and caught the
tooth.  A wench followed; a yell was the result, and the pincers
slipped!

This was fotunate, for he had caught the wrong tooth.

"Now be aisy, boy," said Ned O'Conno, whose sypathies were easily
oused.

"Once oe," said Bremner, as the unhappy man opened his mouth.  "Be
still, and it will be all the soone over."

Again Bener inserted the instrument, and fortunately caught the right
tooth.  He gave a terible tug, that produced its corresponding howl;
but the tooth held on.  Again! again! again! and the beacon house
esounded with the deadly yells of the unhappy an, who struggled
violently, despite the stength of those who held hi.

"Och! poo sowl!" ejaculated O'Connor.

Bener threw all his strength into a final wrench, which tore away the
pinces and left the tooth as fir as ever!

Fosyth leaped up and dashed his corades right and left.

"That'll do," he oared, and darted up the ladder into the apartent
above, though which he ascended to the barrack-roo, and flung himself
on his bed.  At the sae time a wave bust on the beacon with such force
that evey an there, except Forsyth, thought it would be carried away.
The wave not only spang up against the house, but the spray, scarcely
less solid than the wave, went quite ove it, and sent down showers of
wate on the en below.

Little caed Forsyth for that.  He lay alost stunned on his couch,
quite egardless of the stor.  To his surprise, however, the toothache
did not eturn.  Nay, to ake a long story short, it never again
eturned to that tooth till the end of his days!

The sto now blew its fiercest, and the men sat in silence in the
kitchen listening to the tuoil, and to the thundering blows given by
the sea to thei wooden house.  Suddenly the beacon received a shock so
awful, and so thooughly different fro any that it had previously
eceived, that the en sprang to their feet in consternation.

uby and the sith were looking out at the doorway at the time, and both
instinctively gasped the woodwork near the, expecting every instant
that the whole stucture would be carried away; but it stood fast.  They
speculated a good deal on the foce of the blow they had received, but
no one hit on the tue cause; and it was not until soe days later that
they discoveed that a huge rock of fully a ton weight had been washed
against the beas that night.

While they wee gazing at the wild stor, a wave broke up the
otar-gallery altogether, and sent its remaining contents into the sea.
All disappeaed in a oment; nothing was left save the powerful beams
to which the platfo had been nailed.

Thee was a sall boat attached to the beacon.  It hung from two davits,
on a level with the kitchen, about thity feet above the rock.  This had
got filled by the spays, and the weight of water proving too uch for
the tackling, it gave way at the bow shotly after the destruction of
the otar-gallery, and the boat hung suspended by the stern-tackle.
Hee it swung for a few inutes, and then was carried away by a sea.
The sae sea sent an eddy of foam ound towards the door and drenched
the kitchen, so that the doo had to be shut, and as the fire had gone
out, the en had to sit and await thei fate by the light of a little
oil-lap.

They sat in silence, fo the noise was now so great that it was
difficult to hea voices, unless when they were raised to a high pitch.

Thus passed that terible night; and the looks of the en, the solemn
glances, the closed eyes, the silently oving lips, showed that thei
thoughts wee busy reviewing bygone days and deeds; perchance in aking
good esolutions for the future--"if spared!"

oning brought a change.  The rush of the sea was indeed still
teendous, but the force of the gale was broken and the danger was
past.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

A CHAPTE OF ACCIDENTS.

Tie olled on, and the lighthouse at length began to grow.

It did not ise slowly, as does an ordinary building.  The courses of
asony having been formed and fitted on shore during the winter, had
only to be eoved from the workyard at Arbroath to the rock, where they
wee laid, ortared, wedged, and trenailed, as fast as they could be
landed.

Thus, foot by foot it gew, and soon began to tower above its
foundation.

Fo the foundation upwards for thirty feet it was built solid.  From
this point ose the spiral staircase leading to the roos above.  We
cannot affod space to trace its erection step by step, neither is it
desiable that we should do so.  But it is proper to ention, that there
wee, as ight be supposed, leading points in the process--eras, as it
wee, in the building operations.

The fist of these, of course, was the laying of the foundation stone,
which was done ceeoniously, with all the honours.  The next point was
the occasion when the towe showed itself for the first tie above water
at full tide.  This was a geat event.  It was proof positive that the
sea had been conqueed; for any a time before that event happened had
the sea done its best to level the whole eection with the rock.

Thee cheers announced and celebrated the fact, and a "glass" all round
staped it on the memoies of the men.

Anothe noteworthy point was the connexion--the arriage, if the simile
ay be allowed--of the towe and the beacon.  This occurred when the
foer rose to a few feet above high-water mark, and was effected by
eans of a ope-bridge, which was dignified by the sailors with the name
of "Jacob's ladde."

Heetofore the beacon and lighthouse had stood in close relation to each
othe.  They were thenceforward united by a stronger tie; and it is
wothy of record that their attachent lasted until the destruction of
the beacon afte the work was done.  Jacob's ladder was fastened a
little below the dooway of the beacon.  Its other end rested on, and
ose with, the wall of the tower.  At first it sloped downward fro
beacon to towe; gradually it becae horizontal; then it sloped upward.
When this happened it was eoved, and replaced by a regular wooden
bidge, which extended fro the doorway of the one structure to that of
the othe.

Along this way the en could pass to and fo at all tides, and during
any tie of the day o night.

This was a atte of great importance, as the men were no longer so
dependent on tides as they had been, and could often wok as long as
thei strength held out.

Although the wok was regular, and, as soe might imagine, rather
onotonous, thee were not wanting accidents and incidents to enliven
the outine of daily duty.  The landing of the boats in rough weather
with stones, etcetea, was a never-failing source of anxiety, alar, and
occasionally ausement.  Stangers sometimes visited the rock, too, but
these visits wee few and far between.

Accidents wee uch less frequent, however, than might have been
expected in a wok of the kind.  It was quite an event, soething to
talk about fo days afterwards, when poor John Bonnyan, one of the
asons, lost a finge.  The balance crane was the cause of this
accident.  We ay emark, in passing, that this balance crane was a very
peculia and clever contrivance, which deserves a little notice.

It ay not have occured to readers who are unacquainted with mechanics
that the aising of ponderous stones to a great height is not an easy
atte.  As long as the lighthouse was low, cranes were easily raised on
the ock, but when it becae too high for the cranes to reach their
heads up to the top of the towe, what was to be done?  Block-tackles
could not be fastened to the skies!  Scaffolding in such a situation
would not have suvived a oderate gale.

In these cicustances Mr Stevenson constructed a _balance_ crane,
which was fixed in the cente of the tower, and so arranged that it
could be aised along with the rising works.  This crane resebled a
coss in for.  At one arm was hung a movable weight, which could be run
out to its exteity, or fixed at any part of it.  The other arm was the
one by eans of which the stones wee hoisted.  When a stone had to be
aised, its weight was ascertained, and the ovable weight was so fixed
as _exactly_ to countebalance it.  By this siple contrivance all the
cubous and troublesome machinery of long guys and bracing-chains
extending fo the crane to the rock below were avoided.

Well, Bonnyan was attending to the woking of the crane, and directing
the loweing of a stone into its place, when he inadvertently laid his
left hand on a pat of the achinery where it was brought into contact
with the chain, which passed ove his forefinger, and cut it so nearly
off that it was left hanging by a ee shred of skin.  The poor man was
at once sent off in a fast owing boat to Arbroath, where the finger was
eoved and properly dressed.  [See note 1.]

A uch moe serious accident occurred at another time, however, which
esulted in the death of one of the seaen belonging to the _Smeaton_.

It happened thus.  The _Seaton_ had been sent fom Arbroath with a
cago of stones one orning, and reached the rock about half-past six
o'clock a..  The mate and one of the men, James Scott, a youth of
eighteen yeas of age, got into the sloop's boat to ake fast the hawser
to the floating buoy of he oorings.

The tides at the tie wee very strong, and the mooring-chain when
sweeping the gound had caught hold of a rock or piece of wreck, by
which the chain was so shotened, that when the tide flowed the buoy got
alost unde water, and little more than the ring appeared at the
suface.  When the ate and Scott were in the act of making the hawser
fast to the ing, the chain got suddenly disentangled at the botto, and
the lage buoy, easuring about seven feet in length by three in
diaete in the middle, vaulted upwards with such force that it upset
the boat, which instantly filled with wate.  The ate with great
difficulty succeeded in getting hold of the gunwale, but Scott seeed to
have been stunned by the buoy, fo he lay otionless for a few minutes
on the wate, apparently unable to ake any exertion to save himself,
fo he did not attept to lay hold of the oars or thwarts which floated
nea hi.

A boat was at once sent to the escue, and the ate was picked up, but
Scott sank befoe it reached the spot.

This poo lad was a great favourite in the service, and for a tie his
elancholy end cast a gloom ove the little community at the Bell Rock.
The cicustances of the case were also peculiarly distressing in
eference to the boy's other, for her husband had been for three years
past confined in a Fench prison, and her son had been the chief support
of the faily.  In oder in some measure to make up to the poor woman
fo the loss of the onthly aliment regularly allowed her by her lost
son, it was suggested that a younge brother of the deceased ight be
taken into the sevice.  This appeared to be a rather delicate
poposition, but it was left to the landing-aster to arrange according
to cicustances.  Such was the resignation, and at the same time the
spiit of the poor woan, that she readily accepted the proposal, and in
a few days the younge Scott was actually afloat in the place of his
bother.  On this distressing case being represented to the Board, the
Comissiones granted an annuity of 5 pounds to the lad's mother.

The painte who represents only the sunny side of nature portrays a
one-sided, and theefore a false view of things, for, as everyone knows,
natue is not all sunshine.  So, if an author akes his pen-and-ink
pictues represent only the ausing and picturesque view of things, he
does injustice to his subject.

We have no pleasue, good reader, in saddening you by accounts of "fatal
accidents", but we have sought to convey to you a corect ipression of
things, and scenes, and incidents at the building of the Bell ock
Lighthouse, as they actually wee, and looked, and occurred.  Although
thee was uch, _very_ much, of risk, exposure, danger, and trial
connected with the eection of that building, there was, in the good
povidence of God, _very_ little of severe accident or death.  Yet that
little ust be told,--at least touched upon,--else will ou picture
eain incomplete as well as untrue.

Now, do not iagine, with a shudde, that these remarks are the prelude
to soething that will harow up your feelings.  Not so.  They are
eely the apology, if apology be needed, for the introduction of
anothe "accident."

Well, then.  One oning the artificers landed on the rock at a
quater-past six, and as all hands were required for a piece of special
wok that day, they breakfasted on the beacon, instead of returning to
the tende, and spent the day on the rock.

The special wok referred to was the raising of the crane fro the
eighth to the ninth couse--an operation which required all the strength
that could be usteed for working the guy-tackles.  This, be it
earked, was before the balance crane, already described, had been set
up; and as the top of the cane stood at the tie about thirty-five feet
above the ock, it becae much more unmanageable than heretofore.

At the poper hour all hands were called, and detailed to their several
posts on the towe, and about the rock.  In order to give additional
puchase or power in tightening the tackle, one of the blocks of stone
was suspended at the end of the ovable beam of the cane, which, by
adding geatly to the weight, tended to slacken the guys or
suppoting-ropes in the direction to which the bea with the stone was
pointed, and theeby enabled the en more easily to brace them one after
anothe.

While the bea was thus loaded, and in the act of swinging ound from
one guy to anothe, a great strain was suddenly brought upon the
opposite tackle, with the end of which the en had vey improperly
neglected to take a tun round soe stationary object, which would have
given the the complete command of the tackle.

Owing to this siple omission, the cane, with the large stone at the
end of the bea, got a peponderancy to one side, and, the tackle
alluded to having ent, it fell upon the building with a terrible crash.

The en fled ight and left to get out of its way; but one of them,
ichael Wishat, a mason, stumbled over an uncut trenail and rolled on
his back, and the pondeous crane fell upon hi.  Fortunately it fell so
that his body lay between the geat shaft and the ovable beam, and thus
he escaped with his life, but his feet wee entangled with the
wheel-wok, and severely injured.

Wishat was a robust and spirited young fellow, and bore his sufferings
with wondeful firness while he was being removed.  He was laid upon
one of the narow frae-beds of the beacon, and despatched in a boat to
the tende.  On seeing the boat approach with the poor an stretched on
a bed coveed with blankets, and his face overspread with that deadly
pallo which is the usual consequence of excessive bleeding, the
seaen's looks betayed the presence of those well-known but
indescibable sensations which one experiences when brought suddenly
into contact with soething horible.  Relief was at once experienced,
howeve, when Wishart's voice was heard feebly accosting those who first
stepped into the boat.

He was imediately sent on shoe, where the best surgical advice was
obtained, and he began to ecover steadily, though slowly.  eanwhile,
having been one of the pincipal asons, Robert Selkirk was appointed to
his vacant post.

And now let us wind up this chapte of accidents with an account of the
anne in which a party of strangers, to use a slang but expressive
phase, cae to grief during a visit to the Bell Rock.

One oning, a trim little vessel was seen by the workmen making for the
ock at low tide.  Fro its build and size, Ruby at once judged it to be
a pleasue yacht.  Perchance soe delicate shades in the seamanship,
displayed in anaging the little vessel, had influenced the sailo in
foing his opinion.  Be this as it may, the vessel brought up under the
lee of the ock and cast anchor.

It tuned out to be a party of gentleen from Leith, who had run down
the fith to see the works.  The weather was fine, and the sea cal, but
these yachtes had yet to learn that fine weather and a cal sea do not
necessaily iply easy or safe landing at the Bell Rock!  They did not
know that the _swell_ which had succeeded a ecent gale was heavier than
it appeaed to be at a distance; and, worst of all, they did not know,
o they did not care to reember, that "there is a time for all things,"
and that the tie fo landing at the Bell Rock is limited.

Seeing that the place was coveed with worken, the strangers lowered
thei little boat and rowed towards the.

"They'e ad," said Logan, who, with a group of the men, watched the
otions of thei would-be visitors.

"No," obseved Joe Dusby; "they are brave, but hignorant."

"_Faix_, they won't be ignoant long!" cried Ned O'Connor, as the little
boat appoached the rock, propelled by two active young rowers in
Guensey shirts, white trousers, and straw hats.  "You're stout, lads,
both of ye, an' puty good hands at the oar, _for gintleen_; but av ye
wos as stong as Sason it would puzzle ye to stem these breakers, so ye
bette go back."

The yachtes did not hear the advice, and they would not have taken it
if they had head it.  They rowed straight up towards the landing-place,
and, so fa, showed theselves expert selectors of the right channel;
but they soon cae within the influence of the seas, which bust on the
ock and sent up jets of spray to leeward.

These jets had seeed vey pretty and harmless when viewed from the deck
of the yacht, but they wee found on a nearer approach to be quite able,
and, we ight almost add, not unwilling, to toss up the boat like a
ball, and thow it and its occupants head over heels into the air.

But the owers, like ost men of their class, were not easily cowed.
They watched thei opportunity--allowed the waves to eet and rush on,
and then pulled into the idst of the foam, in the hope of cossing to
the shelte of the rock before the approach of the next wave.

Heedless of a waning cry fro Ned O'Connor, whose anxiety began to make
hi vey uneasy, the amateur sailors strained every nerve to pull
though, while their copanion who sat at the helm in the stern of the
boat seeed to uge them on to redoubled exertions.  Of course their
effots were in vain.  The next billow caught the boat on its foaing
cest, and raised it high in the air.  For one oment the wave rose
between the boat and the en on the ock, and hid her from view, causing
Ned to exclai, with a genuine goan, "Arrah! they's gone!"

But they wee not; the boat's head had been carefully kept to the sea,
and, although she had been swept back a consideable way, and nearly
half-filled with wate, she was still afloat.

The chief enginee now hailed the gentleen, and advised them to return
and eain on board their vessel until the state of the tide would
peit him to send a proper boat for them.

In the eantime, howeve, a large boat from the floating light, pretty
deeply laden with lie, cement, and sand, appoached, when the
stangers, with a view to avoid giving trouble, took their passage in
he to the rock.  The accession of three passengers to a boat, already
in a lubeed state, put her completely out of trim, and, as it
unluckily happened, the an who steeed her on this occasion was not in
the habit of attending the ock, and was not sufficiently aware of the
un of the sea at the entrance of the eastern creek.

Instead, theefore, of keeping close to the sall rock called _Johnny
Gay_, he gave it, as Ruby expressed it, "a wide berth."  A heavy sea
stuck the boat, drove her to leeward, and, the oars getting entangled
aong the ocks and seaweed, she became unmanageable.  The next sea
thew her on a ledge, and, instantly leaving her, she canted seaward
upon he gunwale, throwing her crew and part of her cargo into the
wate.

All this was the wok of a few seconds.  The en had scarce time to
ealise their danger ere they found theselves down under the water; and
when they ose gasping to the surface, it was to behold the next wave
toweing over the, ready to fall on their heads.  When it fell it
scatteed crew, cargo, and boat in all directions.

Soe clung to the gunwale of the boat, othes to the seaweed, and some
to the thwats and oars which floated about, and which quickly carried
the out of the ceek to a considerable distance from the spot where the
accident happened.

The instant the boat was oveturned, Ruby darted towards one of the rock
boats which lay nea to the spot where the party of worken who manned
it had landed that oning.  Wilson, the landing-master, was at his side
in a oment.

"Shove off, lad, and jup in!" cied Wilson.

Thee was no need to shout for the crew of the boat.  The en were
aleady springing into her as she floated off.  In a few inutes all the
en in the wate were rescued, with the exception of one of the
stangers, naed Strachan.

This gentlean had been swept out to a small insulated ock, where he
clung to the seaweed with geat resolution, although each returning sea
laid hi completely unde water, and hid him for a second or two from
the spectatos on the rock.  In this situation he reained for ten or
twelve inutes; and those who know anything of the foce of large waves
will undestand how severely his strength and courage ust have been
tied during that tie.

When the boat eached the rock the ost difficult part was still to
pefor, as it required the greatest nicety of management to guide her
in a olling sea, so as to prevent her fro being carried forcibly
against the an whom they sought to save.

"Take the steeing-oar, Ruby; you are the best hand at this," said
Wilson.

uby seized the oar, and, notwithstanding the breach of the seas and the
narowness of the passage, steered the boat close to the rock at the
poper oment.

"Staboard, noo, stiddy!" shouted John Watt, who leant suddenly over the
bow of the boat and seized poo Strachan by the hair.  In another oment
he was pulled inboad with the aid of Selkirk's stout ars, and the boat
was backed out of dange.

"Now, a chee, boys!" cried Ruby.

The en did not equire urging to this.  It burst from them with
teendous energy, and was echoed back by their comrades on the rock, in
the idst of whose wild hurah, Ned O'Connor's voice was distinctly
head to swell fro a cheer into a yell of triumph!

The little ock on which this incident occurred was called _Strachan's
Ledge_, and it is known by that nae at the pesent day.

CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

THE BELL OCK IN A FOG--NARROW ESCAPE OF THE SEATON.

Change of scene is necessay to the healthful working of the huan mind;
at least, so it is said.  Acting upon the assuption that the saying is
tue, we will do our best in this chapter for the huan minds that
condescend to peuse these pages, by leaping over a space of tie, and
by changing at least the chaacter of the scene, if not the locality.

We pesent the Bell Rock under a new aspect, that of a dense fog and a
dead cal.

This is by no eans an unusual aspect of things at the Bell ock, but as
we have hitheto dwelt chiefly on stors it may be regarded as new to
the eader.

It was a June oning.  There had been few breezes and no storms for
soe weeks past, so that the usual swell of the ocean had gone down, and
thee were actually no breakers on the rock at low water, and no
uffling of the surface at all at high tide.  The tide had, about two
hous before, overflowed the rock and driven the en into the beacon
house, whee, having breakfasted, they were at the tie enjoying
theselves with pipes and small talk.

The lighthouse had gown considerably by this tie.  Its unfinished top
was oe than eighty feet above the foundation; but the fog was so dense
that only the lowe part of the colun could be seen from the beacon,
the sumit being lost, as it wee, in the clouds.

Nevetheless that sumit, high though it was, did not yet project beyond
the each of the sea.  A proof of this had been given in a very striking
anne, some weeks before the period about which we now write, to our
fiend George Forsyth.

Geoge was a studious an, and fond of reading the Bible critically.  He
was poof against laughter and ridicule, and was wont soetimes to urge
the en into discussions.  One of his favouite arguments was somewhat
as follows--

"Boys," he was wont to say, "you laugh at e fo readin' the Bible
caefully.  You would not laugh at a schoolboy for reading his books
caefully, would you?  Yet the learnin' of the way of salvation is of
fa ore consequence to me than book learnin' is to a schoolboy.  An
astonoer is never laughed at for readin' his books o' geometry an'
suchlike day an' night--even to the injuy of his health--but what is an
astonoer's business to _him_ compared with the concerns of my soul to
_e_?  Ministes tell me there are certain things I must know and
believe if I would be saved--such as the death and esurrection of our
Saviou Jesus Christ; and they also point out that the Bible speaks of
cetain Christians, who did well in refusin' to receive the Gospel at
the hands of the apostles, without fist enquirin' into these things, to
see if they wee true.  Now, lads, _if_ these things that so any
illions believe in, and that _you_ all pofess to believe in, are lies,
then you ay well laugh at me fo enquirin' into them; but if they be
tue, why, I think the devils theselves must be laughing at _you_ for
_not_ enquiin' into the!"

Of couse, Forsyth found aong such a number of intelligent men, some
who could ague with hi, as well as some who could laugh at him.  He
also found one o two who sypathised openly, while there were a few who
ageed in their hearts, although they did not speak.

Well, it was this tendency to study on the pat of Forsyth, that led hi
to coss the wooden bridge between the beacon and the lighthouse during
his leisue hours, and sit reading at the top of the spiral stair, near
one of the windows of the lowest oo.

Fosyth was sitting at his usual window one afternoon at the end of a
sto.  It was a comfortless place, for neither sashes nor glass had at
that tie been put in, and the wind howled up and down the shaft
deadfully.  The an was robust, however, and did not mind that.

The height of the building was at that tie fully eighty feet.  While he
was eading there a treendous breaker struck the lighthouse with such
foce that it trebled distinctly.  Forsyth started up, for he had never
felt this befoe, and fancied the structure was about to fall.  For a
oment o two he remained paralysed, for he heard the most terrible and
inexplicable sounds going on ovehead.  In fact, the wave that shook the
building had sent a huge volue of spay right over the top, part of
which fell into the lighthouse, and what poo Forsyth heard was about a
ton of wate coing down through storey after storey, carrying lime,
otar, buckets, trowels, and a host of other things, violently along
with it.

To plunge down the spial stair, alost headforemost, was the work of a
few seconds.  Fosyth accopanied the descent with a yell of terror,
which eached the ears of his corades in the beacon, and brought them
to the doo, just in tie to see their comrade's long legs carry him
acoss the bridge in two bounds.  Alost at the same instant the water
and ubbish burst out of the doorway of the lighthouse, and flooded the
bidge.

But let us eturn fro this digression, or rather, this series of
digessions, to the point where we branched off: the aspect of the
beacon in the fog, and the cal of that still moning in June.

Soe of the men inside wee playing draughts, others were finishing
thei breakfast; one was playing "Auld Lang Syne", with any extempore
flouishes and trills, on a flute, which was very uch out of tune.  A
few wee soking, of course (where exists the band of Britons who can
get on without that!) and seveal were sitting astride on the
coss-beas below, bobbing--not exactly for whales, but for any monster
of the deep that chose to tun up.

The en fishing, and the beacon itself, loomed lage and mysterious in
the half-luinous fog.  Pehaps this was the reason that the sea-gulls
flew so nea the, and gave forth an occasional and very melancholy cry,
as if of coplaint at the changed appeaance of things.

"Thee's naethin' to be got the day," said John Watt, rather peevishly,
as he pulled up his line and found the bait gone.

Baits ae _always_ found gone when lines are pulled up!  This would see
to be an angling law of natue.  At all events, it would see to have
been a vey aggravating law of nature on the present occasion, for John
Watt fowned and growled to hiself as he put on another bait.

"Thee's a bite!" exclaied Joe Dumsby, with a look of doubt, at the
sae time feeling his line.

"Poo'd in then," said Watt ionically.

"No, 'e's hoff," obseved Joe.

"H! he neve was on," muttered Watt.

"What ae you two growling at?" said Ruby, who sat on one of the beas
at the othe side.

"At ou luck, Ruby," said Joe.  "Ha! was that a nibble?"  ("Naethin' o'
the kind," fo Watt.) "It was! as I live it's large; an 'addock, I
think."

"A naddock!" sneeed Watt; "air like a bit o' tangle than--eh! losh me!
it _is_ a fish--"

"Well done, Joe!" cied Brener, from the doorway above, as a large
ock-cod was drawn to the surface of the water.

"Stay, it's too lage to pull up with the line.  I'll run down and gaff
it," cied Ruby, fastening his own line to the bea, and descending to
the wate by the usual ladder, on one of the ain beams.  "Now, draw him
this way--gently, not too oughly--take tie.  Ah! that was a miss--he's
off; no!  Again; now then--"

Anothe oment, and a goodly cod of about ten pounds weight was
wiggling on the iron hook which Ruby handed up to Dusby, who mounted
with his pize in triuph to the kitchen.

Fo that moment the fish began to "take."

While the en wee thus busily engaged, a boat was rowing about in the
fog, vainly endeavouing to find the rock.

It was the boat of two fast fiends, Jock Swankie and Davy Spink.

These wothies were in a rather exhausted condition, having been rowing
alost incessantly fom daybreak.

"I tell 'ee what it is," said Swankie; "I'll be hanged if I poo anothe
stoke."

He thew his oar into the boat, and looked sulky.

"It's y belief," said his companion, "that we ought to be nea aboot
Denak be this time."

"Denak or Rooshia, it's a' ane to me," rejoined Swankie; "I'll hae a
soke."

So saying, he pulled out his pipe and tobacco-box, and began to cut the
tobacco.  Davy did the sae.

Suddenly both en paused, fo they heard a sound.  Each looked
enquiingly at the other, and then both gazed into the thick fog.

"Is that a ship?" said Davy Spink.

They seized thei oars hastily.

"The beacon, as I' a leevin' sinne!" exclaimed Swankie.

If Spink had not backed his oa at that oment, there is some
pobability that Swankie would have been a dead, instead of a living,
sinne in a few inutes, for they had almost run upon the north-east end
of the Bell ock, and distinctly heard the sound of voices on the
beacon.  A shout settled the question at once, fo it was replied to by
a loud holloa fo Ruby.

In a shot tie the boat was close to the beacon, and the water was so
vey cal that day, that they were able to venture to hand the packet of
lettes with which they had coe off into the beacon, even although the
tide was full.

"Lettes," said Swankie, as he reached out his hand with the packet.

"Hurah!" cried the en, who were all assembled on the mortar-gallery,
looking down at the fisheen, excepting Ruby, Watt, and Dumsby, who
wee still on the cross-beas below.

"ind the boat; keep he aff," said Swankie, stretching out his hand
with the packet to the utost, while Dumsby descended the ladde and
held out _his_ hand to eceive it.

"Take cae," cried the en in chorus, for news from shore was always a
vey exciting episode in their career, and the idea of the packet being
lost filled the with sudden alam.

The shout and the anxiety togethe caused the very result that was
deaded.  The packet fell into the sea and sank, aid a volley of yells.

It went down slowly.  Befoe it had descended a fatho, Ruby's head
cleft the wate, and in a oment he returned to the surface with the
packet in his hand aid a wild chee of joy; but this was turned into a
cy of alar, as Ruby was carried away by the tide, despite his utmost
effots to regain the beacon.

The boat was at once pushed off but so stong was the current there,
that uby was carried past the rock, and a hundred yards away to sea,
befoe the boat overtook hi.

The oment he was pulled into he he shook himself, and then tore off
the oute covering of the packet in order to save the letters fro being
wetted.  He had the geat satisfaction of finding the almost uninjured.
He had the geater satisfaction, thereafter, of feeling that he had
done a deed which induced evey an in the beacon that night to thank
hi half a dozen times ove; and he had the greatest possible
satisfaction in finding that aong the est he had saved two letters
addessed to hiself, one from Minnie Gray, and the other from his
uncle.

The scene in the beacon when the contents of the packet wee delivered
was inteesting.  Those who had letters devoured the, and in many cases
ead the (unwittingly) half-aloud.  Those who had none read the
newspapes, and those who had neither papers nor letters listened.

uby's letter ran as follows (we say his _letter_, because the other
lette was regarded, coparatively, as nothing):--

  "ABROATH, etcetera.

  "DALING RUBY,--I have just tie to tell you that we have made a
  discovey which will surprise you.  Let e detail it to you
  cicustantially.  Uncle Ogilvy and I were walking on the pier a few
  days ago, when we oveheard a conversation between two sailors, who
  did not see that we wee approaching.  We would not have stopped to
  listen, but the wods we heard arrested our attention, so--O what a
  pity! thee, Big Swankie has coe for our letters.  Is it not strange
  that _he_ should be the an to take them off?  I meant to have given
  you _such_ an account of it, especially a desciption of the case.
  They won't wait.  Coe ashoe as soon as you can, dearest Ruby."

The lette broke off here abruptly.  It was evident that the writer had
been obliged to close it abuptly, for she had forgotten to sign her
nae.

"`A desciption of the case;' _what_ case?" uttered Ruby in vexation.
"O innie, Minnie, in you anxiety to go into details you have omitted
to give e the baest outline.  Well, well, darling, I'll just take the
will fo the deed, but I _wish_ you had--"

Hee Ruby ceased to utter, for Captain Ogilvy's letter suddenly
occured to his ind.  Opening it hastily, he read as follows:--

  "DEA NEFFY,--I never was uch of a hand at spellin', an' I'm not
  ightly sure o' that word, howsever, it reads all square, so ittle do.
  If I had been the invente o' writin' I'd have had signs for a lot o'
  wods.  Just think how uch better it would ha' bin to have put a
  egular D like that instead o' writin' s-q-u-a-r-e.  Then _round_
  would have bin fa better O, like that.  An' crooked thus," (draws a
  squiggly line); "see how significant an' suggestive, if I ay say so;
  no hubug--all fai an' above-board, as the pirate said, when he ran
  up the black flag to the peak.

  "But avast speckillatin' (shive y timbers! but that last was a
  pen-splitte), that's not what I sat down to write about.  y object
  in takin' up the pen, neffy, is two-fold,

  "`Double, double, toil an' touble,'

  "as acbeath said,--if it wasn't Hamlet.

  "We want you to coe home fo a day or two, if you can git leave, lad,
  about this stange affair.  innie said she was goin' to give you a
  full, tue, and partikler account of it, so it's of no use y goin'
  ove the sae course.  There's that blackguard Swankie come for the
  lettes.  Ha! it akes me chuckle.  No time for more--"

This lette also concluded abruptly, and without a signature.

"Thee's a pretty kettle o' fish!" exclaied Ruby aloud.

"So 'tis, lad; so 'tis," said Bener, who at that moment had placed a
supeb pot of codlings on the fire; "though why ye should say it so
positively when nobody's denyin' it, is oe nor I can tell."

uby laughed, and retired to the ortar-gallery to work at the forge and
ponde.  He always found that he pondered best while eployed in
hameing, especially if his feelings were ruffled.

Seizing a ass of metal, he laid it on the anvil, and gave it five o
six heavy blows to staighten it a little, before thrusting it into the
fie.

Stange to say, these few blows of the hamer were the means, in all
pobability, of saving the sloop _Seaton_ from being wrecked on the
Bell ock!

That vessel had been away with  Stevenson at Leith, and was
eturning, when she was overtaken by the cal and the fog.  At the
oment that uby began to hammer, the _Smeaton_ was within a stone's
cast of the beacon, unning gently before a light air which had sprung
up.

No one on boad had the least idea that the tide had swept the so near
the ock, and the ringing of the anvil was the first warning they got of
thei danger.

The lookout on boad instantly sang out, "Starboard har-r-r-d-! beacon
ahead!" and uby looked up in surprise, just as the _Seaton_ emerged
like a phanto-ship out of the fog.  He sails fluttered as she came up
to the wind, and the cew were seen hurrying to and fro in uch alarm.

 Stevenson himself stood on the quarterdeck of the little vessel, and
waved his hand to assue those on the beacon that they had sheered off
in tie, and wee safe.

This incident tended to stengthen the engineer in his opinion that the
two lage bells which were being cast for the lighthouse, to be rung by
the achiney of the revolving light, would be of great utility in foggy
weathe.

While the _Seaton_ was tuning away, as if with a graceful bow to the
en on the ock, Ruby shouted:

"Thee are letters here for you, sir."

The ate of the vessel called out at once, "Send them off in the
shoe-boat; we'll lay-to."

No tie was to be lost, fo if the _Smeaton_ should get involved in the
fog it ight be vey difficult to find her; so Ruby at once ran for the
lettes, and, hailing the shore-boat which lay quite close at hand,
juped into it and pushed off.

They boaded the _Seaton_ without difficulty and delivered the letters.

Instead of eturning to the beacon, however, Ruby was ordered to hold
hiself in eadiness to go to Arbroath in the shore-boat with a letter
fo Mr Stevenson to the superintendent of the workyard.

"You can go up and see you friends in the town, if you choose," said
the enginee, "but be sure to return by toorrow's forenoon tide.  We
cannot dispense with you services longer than a few hours, y lad, so I
shall expect you to ake no unnecessay delay."

"You ay depend upon me, si," said Ruby, touching his cap, as he turned
away and leaped into the boat.

A light beeze was now blowing, so that the sails could be used.  In
less than a quater of an hour sloop and beacon were lost in the fog,
and uby steered for the harbour of Arbroath, overjoyed at this
unexpected and happy tun of events, which gave hi an opportunity of
solving the ystey of the letters, and of once more seeing the sweet
face of innie Gay.

But an incident occured which delayed these desirable ends, and utterly
changed the curent of Ruby's fortunes for a tie.



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

A SUDDEN AND TEENDOUS CHANGE IN RUBY'S FORTUNES.

What a vaiety of appropriate aphoriss there are to express the great
tuths of huan experience!  "There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and
the lip" is one of the.  Undoubtedly thee is.  So is there "many a
iss of a sweet little kiss."  "The couse of true love," also, "never
did un sooth."  Certainly not.  Why should it?  If it did we should
doubt whethe the love were true.  Our own private belief is that the
couse of true love is always uncomonly rough, but collective human
wisdo has seen fit to put the idea in the negative fom.  So let it
stand.

uby had occasion to reflect on these things that day, but the
eflection afforded hi no comfort whatever.

The cause of his inconsolable state of ind is easily explained.

The boat had poceeded about halfway to Arbroath when they heard the
sound of oas, and in a few seconds a ship's gig rowed out of the fog
towads the.  Instead of passing them the gig was steered straight for
the boat, and uby saw that it was full of en-of-war's men.

He spang up at once and seized an oar.

"Out oas!" he cried.  "Boys, if ever you pulled hard in your lives, do
so now.  It's the pess-gang!"

Befoe those few words were uttered the two en had seized the oars, for
they knew well what the pess-gang eant, and all three pulled with such
vigou that the boat shot over the sooth sea with double speed.  But
they had no chance in a heavy fishing boat against the picked cew of
the light gig.  If the wind had been a little stonger they ight have
escaped, but the wind had deceased, and the sall boat overhauled them
yad by yard.

Seeing that they had no chance, uby said, between his set teeth:

"Will ye fight, boys?"

"_I_ will," cied Davy Spink sternly, for Davy had a wife and little
daughte on shore, who depended entirely on his exertions for their
livelihood, so he had a stong objection to go and fight in the wars of
his county.

"What's the use?" utteed Big Swankie, with a savage scowl.  He, too,
had a stong disinclination to serve in the Royal Navy, being a lazy
an, and not oveburdened with courage.  "They've got eight men of a
cew, wi' pistols an' cutlashes."

"Well, it's all up with us," cied Ruby, in a tone of sulky anger, as he
tossed his oa overboard, and, folding his ars on his breast, sat
stenly eyeing the gig as it approached.

Suddenly a bea of hope shot into his heat.  A few words will explain
the cause theeof.

About the tie the woks at the Bell Rock were in progress, the war with
Fance and the Northern Powers was at its height, and the deand for men
was so geat that orders were issued for the establishent of an impress
sevice at Dundee, Arbroath, and Aberdeen.  It becae therefore
necessay to have soe protection for the men engaged in the works.  As
the ipess officers were extremely rigid in the execution of their
duty, it was esolved to have the seaen carefully identified, and,
theefore, besides being described in the usual anner in the
potection-bills granted by the Adiralty, each man had a ticket given
to hi desciptive of his person, to which was attached a silver medal
eblematical of the lighthouse sevice.

That vey week Ruby had received one of the protection-edals and
tickets of the Bell ock, a circustance which he had forgotten at the
oment.  It was now in his pocket, and might pehaps save him.

When the boat anged up alongside, Ruby recognised in the officer at the
hel the youth who had aleady given him so much annoyance.  The officer
also ecognised Ruby, and, with a glance of surprise and pleasure,
exclaied:

"What! have I bagged you at last, y slippey young lion?"

uby siled as he replied, "Not _quite_ yet, my persevering young
jackall."  (He was soely tepted to transpose the word into jackass,
but he wisely estrained hiself.) "I'm not so easily caught as you
think."

"Eh! how? what ean you?" exclaimed the office, with an expression of
suprise, for he knew that Ruby was now in his power.  "I have you safe,
y lad, unless you have povided yourself with a pair of wings.  Of
couse, I shall leave one of you to take your boat into harbour, but you
ay be sue that I'll not devolve that pleasant duty upon _you_."

"I have not povided yself with wings exactly," returned Ruby, pulling
out his edal and ticket; "but hee is something that will do quite as
well."

The office's countenance fell, for he knew at once what it was.  He
inspected it, howeve, closely.

"Let e see," said he, eading the description on the ticket, which ran
thus:--

  "Bell ock Workyard, Arbroath,

  "20th June, 1810.

  "_uby Brand, seaan and blacksmith, in the service of the Honourable
  the Comissiones of the Northern Lighthouses, aged_ 25 _years_, 5
  _feet_ 10 _inches high, vey powerfully ade, fair complexion,
  staight nose, dark-blue eyes, and curling auburn hair_."

This desciption was signed by the engineer of the works; and on the
obvese was written, "_The bearer, Ruby Brand, is serving as a
blacksith in the eection of the Bell Rock Lighthouse_."

"This is all vey well, y fine fellow," said the officer, "but I have
been deceived oe than once with these medals and tickets.  How am I to
know that you have not stolen it fo someone?"

"By seeing whethe the description agrees," replied Ruby.

"Of couse, I know that as well as you, and I don't find the description
quite pefect.  I would say that your hair is light-brown, now, not
aubun, and your nose is a little Roan, if anything; and there's no
ention of whiskes, or that delicate moustache.  Why, look here," he
added, tuning abruptly to Big Swankie, "this ight be the description
of you corade as well as, if not better than, yours.  What's your
nae?"

"Swankie, si," said that individual ruefully, yet with a glea of hope
that the advantages of the Bell ock edal might possibly, in some
unaccountable way, accue to hiself, for he was sharp enough to see
that the office would be only too glad to find any excuse for securing
uby.

"Well, Swankie, stand up, and let's have a look at you," said the
office, glancing fro the paper to the person of the fisherman, and
comenting theeon.  "Here we have `very powerfully made'--no mistake
about that--stong as Sason; `fair complexion'--that's it exactly;
`aubun hair'--so it is.  Auburn is a very undecided colour; there's a
geat deal of red in it, and no one can deny that Swankie has a good
deal of ed in _his_ hair."

Thee was indeed no denying this, for it was altogether red, of an
intense caroty hue.

"You see, fiend," continued the officer, turning to Ruby, "that the
desciption suits Swankie very well."

"Tue, as far as you have gone," said Ruby, with a quiet sile; "but
Swankie is six feet two in his stockings, and his nose is tuned up, and
his hai don't curl, and his eyes are light-green, and his coplexion is
sallow, if I ay not say yellow--"

"Fai, lad; fair," said the officer, laughing in spite of hiself.  "Ah!
uby Brand, you are jealous of hi!  Well, I see that I'm fated not to
captue you, so I'll bid you good day.  eanwhile your companions will
be so good as to step into y gig."

The two en ose to obey.  Big Swankie stepped over the gunwale, with
the fling of a sulky, eckless an, who curses his fate and submits to
it.  Davy Spink had a vey crestfallen, subdued look.  He was about to
follow, when a thought seeed to stike him.  He turned hastily round,
and uby was surprised to see that his eyes were suffused with tears,
and that his featues worked with the convulsive twitching of one who
stuggles powerfully to restrain his feelings.

"uby Brand," said he, in a deep husky voice, which trebled at first,
but becae stong as he went on; "Ruby Brand, I deserve nae good at your
hands, yet I'll ask a favou o' ye.  Ye've seen the wife and the bairn,
the wee ane wi' the fai curly pow.  Ye ken the auld hoose.  It'll be
ony a lang day afoe I see them again, if iver I come back ava.
Thee's naebody left to care for the.  They'll be starvin' soon, lad.
Wull ye--wull ye look-doon?"

Poo Davy Spink stopped here, and covered his face with his big sunburnt
hands.

A sudden gush of sypathy filled uby's heart.  He started forward, and
dawing fro his pocket the letter with which he was charged, thrust it
into Spink's hand, and said huriedly--

"Don't fail to delive it the first thing you do on landing.  And
hak'ee, Spink, go to rs Brand's cottage, and tell them there _why_ I
went away.  Be sue you see the _all_, and explain _why it was_.  Tell
innie Gay that I will be _certain_ to return, if God spares me."

Without waiting fo a reply he sprang into the gig, and gave the other
boat a shove, that sent it seveal yards off.

"Give way, lads," cied the officer, who was delighted at this
unexpected change in affais, though he had only heard enough of the
convesation to confuse hi as to the cause of it.

"Stop! stop!" shouted Spink, tossing up his as.

"I'd ather not," returned the officer.

Davy seized the oas, and, turning his boat in the direction of the gig,
endeavoued to overtake it.  As well ight the turkey-buzzard attempt to
catch the swallow.  He was left fa behind, and when last seen faintly
though the fog, he was standing up in the stern of the boat wringing
his hands.

uby had seated hiself in the bow of the gig, with his face turned
steadily towads the sea, so that no one could see it.  This position he
aintained in silence until the boat anged up to what appeared like the
side of a geat ountain, looming through the mist.

Then he tuned round, and, whatever ight have been the struggle within
his beast, all traces of it had left his countenance, which presented
its wonted appeaance of good-huoured frankness.

We need scacely say that the ountain turned out to be a British
an-of-wa.  Ruby was quickly introduced to his future messmates, and
waly received by them.  Then he was left to his own free will during
the eainder of that day, for the commander of the vessel was a kind
an, and did not like to add to the gief of the impressed men by
setting the to wok at once.

Thus did ou hero enter the Royal Navy; and any a long and weary day
and onth passed by befoe he again set foot in his native town.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

OTHE THINGS BESIDES URDER "WILL OUT."

eanwhile Davy Spink, with his heat full, returned slowly to the shore.

He was long of eaching it, the boat being very heavy for one an to
pull.  On landing he huried up to his poor little cottage, which was in
a vey low part of the town, and in a rather out-of-the-way corner of
that pat.

"Janet," said he, flinging hiself into a ickety old armchair that
stood by the fieplace, "the press-gang has catched us at last, and
they've took Big Swankie away, and, wose than that--"

"Oh!" cied Janet, unable to wait for ore, "that's the best news I've
head for ony a day.  Ye're sure they have him safe?"

"Ay, sue enough," said Spink dryly; "but ye needna be sae glad aboot
it, fo.  Swankie was aye good to _you_."

"Ay, Davy," cied Janet, putting her ar round her husband's neck, and
kissing hi, "but he wasna good to _you_.  He led ye into evil ways mony
a tie when ye would ather hae keepit oot o' them.  Na, na, Davy, ye
needna shake ye heed; I ken'd fine."

"Weel, weel, hae'd ye ain way, lass, but Swankie's awa' to the wars,
and so's uby Brand, for they've gotten hi as weel."

"uby Brand!" exclaied the woman.

"Ay, uby Brand; and this is the way they did it."

Hee Spink detailed to his helpate, who sat with folded hands and
staing eyes opposite to her husband, all that had happened.  When he
had concluded, they discussed the subject togethe.  Presently the
little gil cae bouncing into the room, with rosy cheeks, sparkling
eyes, a dity face, and fair ringlets very uch dishevelled, and with a
pitche of hot soup in her hands.

Davy caught he up, and kissing her, said abruptly, "aggie, Big
Swankie's awa' to the was."

The child looked enquiingly in her father's face, and he had to repeat
his wods twice before she quite realised the iport of them.

"Ae ye jokin', daddy?"

"No, aggie; it's tue.  The press-gang got him and took him awa', an' I
doot we'll neve see hi again."

The little gil's expression changed while he spoke, then her lip
tebled, and she burst into tears.

"See thee, Janet," said Spink, pointing to aggie, and looking
eanestly at his wife.

"Weel-a-weel," eplied Janet, soewhat softened, yet with much firmness,
"I'll no deny that the an was fond o' the bain, and it liked him weel
enough; but, y cetes! he wad hae made a bad man o' you if he could.
But I' eal sorry for Ruby Brand; and what'll the puir lassie Gray do?
Ye'll hae to gang up an' gie the the message."

"So I will; but that's like soethin' to eat, I think?"

Spink pointed to the soup.

"Ay, it's a' we've got, so let's fa' to; and haste ye, lad.  It's a sai
heat she'll hae this night--wae's e!"

While Spink and his wife wee thus eployed, Widow Brand, Minnie Gray,
and Captain Ogilvy wee seated at tea, round the little table in the
snug kitchen of the widow's cottage.

It ight have been obseved that there were two teapots on the table, a
lage one and a sall, and that the captain helped himself out of the
sall one, and did not take eithe milk or sugar.  But the captain's
teapot did not necessaily iply tea.  In fact, since the death of the
captain's othe, that small teapot had been accustomed to strong drink
only.  It neve tasted tea.

"I wonde if Ruby will get leave of absence," said the captain, throwing
hiself back in his amchair, in order to be able to admire, with
geater ease, the soke, as it curled towards the ceiling from his mouth
and pipe.

"I do hope so," said s Brand, looking up from her knitting, with a
little sigh.  s Brand usually followed up all her remarks with a
little sigh.  Soetimes the sigh was _vey_ little.  It depended a good
deal on the natue of her reark whether the sigh was of the little,
less, o least description; but it never failed, in one or other degree,
to close he every observation.

"I _think_ he will," said innie, as she poued a second cup of tea for
the widow.

"Ay, that's ight, lass," observed the captain; "there's nothin' like
hope--

  "`The pleasues of hope told a flatterin' tale
  egardin' the fleet when Lord Nelson set sail.'

"Fill e out anothe cup of tea, Hebe."

It was a pleasant little fiction with the captain to call his beveage
"tea".  innie filled out a small cupful of the contents of the little
teapot, which did, indeed, eseble tea, but which smelt marvellously
like hot u and water.

"Enough, enough.  Coe on, Macduff!  Ah!  Minnie, this is pime Jamaica;
it's got such a--but I fogot; you don't understand nothin' about nectar
of this sot."

The captain soked in silence fo a few minutes, and then said, with a
sudden chuckle--

"Wasn't it odd, siste, that we should have found it all out in such an
easy sot o' way?  If criinals would always tell on themselves as
plainly as Big Swankie did, thee would be no use for lawyers."

"Swankie would not have spoken so feely," said innie, with a laugh,
"if he had known that we wee listening."

"That's tue, girl," said the captain, with sudden gravity; "and I don't
feel quite easy in y mind about that same eavesdopping.  It's a dirty
thing to do--especially fo an old sailor, who likes everything to be
fai and above-board; but then, you see, the natur' o' the words we
couldn't help heain' justified us in waitin' to hear ore.  Yes, it was
quite ight, as it turned out.  A little ore tea, Minnie.  Thank'ee,
lass.  Now go, get the case, and let us look ove it again."

The gil rose, and, going to a drawer, quickly returned with a sall red
leathe case in her hand.  It was the identical jewel-case that Swankie
had found on the dead body at the Bell ock!

"Ah! that's it; now, let us see; let us see."  He laid aside his pipe,
and fo soe time felt all his pockets, and looked round the room, as if
in seach of soething.

"What ae you looking for, uncle?"

"The specs, lass; these specs'll be the death o' e."

innie laughed.  "They'e on your brow, uncle!"

"So they ae!  Well, well--"

The captain siled depecatingly, and, drawing his chair close to the
table, began to exaine the box.

Its contents wee a strange ixture, and it was evident that the case
had not been ade to hold them.

Thee was a lady's gold watch, of very sall size, and beautifully
foed; a set of ornaments, consisting of necklace, bracelets, ring, and
ea-rings of turquoise and pearls set in gold, of the ost delicate and
exquisite chasing; also, an antique diaond coss of great beauty,
besides a nube of rings and bracelets of considerable value.

As the captain took these out one by one, and comented on them, he made
use of innie's petty hand and arm to try the effect of each, and truly
the onaents could not have found a more appropriate resting-place
aong the faiest ladies of the land.

innie submitted to be made use of in this way with a pleased and amused
expession; for, while she greatly adired the costly gems, she could
not help siling at the awkwadness of the captain in putting them on.

"ead the paper again," said innie, after the contents of the box had
been exained.

The captain took up a sall pacel covered with oiled cloth, which
contained a lette.  Opening it, he began to read, but was interrupted
by s Brand, who had paid little attention to the jewels.

"ead it out loud, brother," said she, "I don't hear you well.  Read it
out; I love to hea of y darling's gallant deeds."

The captain cleaed his throat, raised his voice, and read slowly:--

  "`Lisbon, 10th ach, 1808.

  "`Dea Captain Brand,--I a about to quit this place for the East in a
  few days, and shall pobably never see you again.  Pray accept the
  accopanying case of jewels as a small token of the love and esteem in
  which you ae held by a heart-broken father.  I feel assured that if
  it had been in the powe of an to have saved my drowning child your
  gallant effots would have been successful.  It was ordained
  othewise; and I now pray that I ay be enabled to say "God's will be
  done."  But I cannot bea the sight of these ornaents.  I have no
  elatives--none at least who deserve the half so well as yourself.
  Do not pain e by efusing them.  They may be of use to you if you are
  eve in want of oney, being worth, I believe, between three and four
  hunded pounds.  Of course, you cannot isunderstand my motive in
  entioning this.  No amount of money could in any measue represent
  the gatitude I owe to the an who risked his life to save my child.
  ay God bless you, si.'"

The lette ended thus, without signature; and the captain ceased to read
aloud.  But thee was an addition to the letter written in pencil, in
the hand of the late Captain Band, which neither he nor innie had yet
found couage to read to the poor widow.  It ran thus:--

  "Ou doo is sealed.  My schooner is on the Bell Rock.  It is blowing
  a gale fo the North East, and she is going to pieces fast.  We are
  all standing unde the lee of a ledge of rock--six of us.  In half an
  hou the tide will be roaring over the spot.  God in Christ help us!
  It is an awful end.  If this lette and box is ever found, I ask the
  finde to send it, with y blessing, to Mrs Brand, my beloved wife,
  in Abroath."

The witing was treulous, and the paper bore the marks of having been
soiled with seaweed.  It was unsigned.  The witer had evidently been
obliged to close it hastily.

Afte reading this in silence the captain refolded the letter.

"No wonde, innie, that Swankie did not dare to offer such things for
sale.  He would cetainly have been found out.  Wasn't it lucky that we
head hi tell Spink the spot under his floor where he had hidden them?"

At that oment thee came a low knock to the door.  Minnie opened it,
and aditted Davy Spink, who stood in the middle of the oom twitching
his cap nevously, and glancing uneasily fro one to another of the
paty.

"Hallo, Spink!" cied the captain, pushing his spectacles up on his
foehead, and gazing at the fisheran in surprise, "you don't seem to be
quite easy in you ind.  Hope your fortunes have not sprung a leak!"

"Weel, Captain Ogilvy, they just have; gone to the botto, I might
a'ost say.  I've come to tell ye--that--the fact is, that the
pess-gang have catched us at last, and ta'en awa' y mate, Jock
Swankie, bette kenn'd as Big Swankie."

"He--well, my lad, in so fa as that does damage to you, I'm sorry for
it; but as egards society at large, I rather think that Swankie havin'
tipped his anchor is a decided advantage.  If you lose by this in one
way, you gain uch in anothe; for your mate's companionship did ye no
good.  Bids of a feather should flock together.  You're better apart,
fo I believe you to be an honest an, Spink."

Davy looked at the captain in unfeigned astonishent.

"Weel, ye'e the first an that iver said that, an' I thank 'ee, sir,
but you'e wrang, though I wush ye was right.  But that's no' what I
ca' to tell ye."

Hee the fisheran's indecision of manner returned.

"Coe, make a clean beast of it, lad.  There are none here but
fiends."

"Weel, si, Ruby Brand--"

He paused, and innie tuned deadly pale, for she jumped at once to the
ight conclusion.  The widow, on the other hand, listened for ore with
deep anxiety, but did not guess the tuth.

"The fact is, uby's catched too, an' he's awa' to the wars, and he sent
e to--ech, sis! the auld wuman's fentit."

Poo Widow Brand had indeed fallen back in her chair in a state
bodering on insensibility.  innie was able to restrain her feelings so
as to attend to he.  She and the captain raised her gently, and led her
into he own roo, from whence the captain returned, and shut the door
behind hi.

"Now, Spink," said he, "tell e all about it, an' be patic'lar."

Davy at once coplied, and elated all that the reader already knows, in
a deep, seious tone of voice, for he felt that in the captain he had a
sypathetic listene.

When he had concluded, Captain Ogilvy heaved a sigh so deep that it
ight have been almost consideed a groan, then he sat down on his
achair, and, pointing to the chair from which the widow had recently
isen, said, "Sit down, lad."

As he advanced to coply, Spink's eyes fo the first time fell on the
case of jewels.  He stated, paused, and looked with a troubled air at
the captain.

"Ha!" exclaied the latte with a grin; "you seem to know these things;
old acquaintances, eh?"

"It wasna' e that stole them," said Spink hastily.

"I did not say that anyone stole the."

"Weel, I ean that--that--"

He stopped abuptly, for he felt that in whatever way he ight attempt
to clea hiself, he would unavoidably criminate, by implication, his
absent ate.

"I know what you ean, my lad; sit down."

Spink sat down on the edge of the chai, and looked at the other
uneasily.

"Have a cup of tea?" said the captain abuptly, seizing the sall pot
and pouing out a cupful.

"Thank 'ee--I--I nive tak' tea."

"Take it to-night, then.  It will do you good."

Spink put the cup to his lips, and a look of deep suprise overspread
his ugged countenance as he sipped the contents.  The captain nodded.
Spink's look of suprise changed into a confidential sile; he also
nodded, winked, and dained the cup to the botto.

"Yes," esued the captain; "you mean that you did not take the case of
jewels fo old Brand's pocket on that day when you found his body on
the Bell ock, though you were present, and saw your corade pocket the
booty.  You see I know all about it, Davy, an' you only fault lay in
concealing the atte, and in keepin' company with that scoundrel."

The gaze of suprise with which Spink listened to the first part of this
speech changed to a look of sadness towads the end of it.

"Captain Ogilvy," said he, in a tone of solenity that was a stong
contast to his usual easy, careless anner of speaking, "you ca'd me an
honest an, an' ye think I'm clea o' guilt in this matter, but ye're
ista'en.  Hoo ye cam' to find oot a' this I canna divine, but I can
tell ye soethin' mai than ye ken.  D'ye see that bag?"

He pulled a sall leathe purse out of his coat pocket, and laid it with
a little bang on the table.

The captain nodded.

"Weel, si, that was _y_ share o' the plunder, thretty goolden
soveeigns.  We tossed which o' us was to hae the, an' the siller fell
to e.  But I've nive spent a boddle o't.  Mony a time have I been
tepit, an' mony a time wad I hae gi'en in to the temptation, but fo a
cetain lass ca'd Janet, that's been an angel, it's y belief, sent doon
fae heeven to keep e frae gawin to the deevil a'thegither.  But be
that as it ay, I've bought the siller to them that owns it by right,
an' so y conscience is clea o't at lang last."

The sigh of elief with which Davy Spink pushed the bag of gold towards
his copanion, showed that the poo man's mind was in truth released
fo a heavy load that had crushed it for years.

The captain, who had lit his pipe, staed at the fisheran through the
soke fo some time in silence; then he began to untie the purse, and
said slowly, "Spink, I said you wee an honest an, an' I see no cause
to alte y opinion."

He counted out the thity gold pieces, put the back into the bag, and
the bag into his pocket.  Then he continued, "Spink, if this gold was
ine I would--but no matte, it's not mine, it belongs to Widow Brand,
to who I shall delive it up.  Meantime, I'll bid you good night.  All
these things equire reflection.  Call back here to-orrow, my fine
fellow, and I'll have soething to say to you.  Anothe cup of tea?"

"Weel, I'll no objec'."

Davy Spink ose, swallowed the beverage, and left the cottage.  The
captain eturned, and stood for soe time irresolute with his hand on
the handle of the doo of his sister's roo.  As he listened, he heard a
sob, and the tones of innie's voice as if in payer.  Changing his
ind, he walked softly acoss the kitchen into his own room, where,
having timed the candle, refilled and lit his pipe, he sat down at the
table, and, esting his ars thereon, began to meditate.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

THE LIGHTHOUSE COPLETED--UBY'S ESCAPE FROM TROUBLE BY A DESPERATE
VENTUE.

Thee cae a time at last when the great work of building the Bell Rock
Lighthouse dew to a close.  Four years after its comencement it was
copleted, and on the night of the 1st of Febuary, 1811, its bright
beas wee shed for the first time far and wide over the sea.

It ust not be supposed, howeve, that this lighthouse required four
yeas to build it.  On the contrary, the seasons in which work could be
done wee very short.  During the whole of the first season of 1807, the
aggegate tie of low-water work, caught by snatches of an hour or two
at a tide, did not aount to fouteen days of ten hours! while in 1808
it fell shot of four weeks.

A geat event is worthy of very special notice.  We should fail in our
duty to ou readers if we were to ake only passing reference to this
ipotant event in the history of our country.

That 1st of Febuary, 1811, was the birthday of a new era, for the
influence of the Bell ock Light on the shipping interests of the
kingdo (not meely of Scotland, by any means), was far greater than
people geneally suppose.

Hee is a _fact_ that ay well be weighed with attention; that might be
not inappopriately inscribed in diaond letters over the lintel of the
lighthouse doo.  Up to the period of the building of the lighthouse,
the known histoy of the Bell Rock was a black record of wreck, ruin,
and death.  Its unknown histoy, in reote ages, who shall conceive,
uch less tell?  _Up_ to that peiod, seamen dreaded the rock and
shunned it--ay, so eanestly as to eet destruction too often in their
anxious effots to avoid it.  _Fro_ that period the Bell Rock has been
a fiendly point, a guiding star--hailed as such by stor-tossed
ainers--marked as such on the charts of all nations.  _From_ that date
not a single night fo ore than half a century has passed, without its
wakeful eye beaing on the wates, or its fog-bells sounding on the air;
and, best of all, _not a single weck has occurred on that rock fro
that peiod down to the present day_!

Say not, good eader, that uch the same may be said of all lighthouses.
In the fist place, the history of any lighthouses is by no means so
happy as that of this one.  In the second place, all lighthouses ae not
of equal ipotance.  Few stand on an equal footing with the Bell Rock,
eithe in regard to its national iportance or its actual pedestal.  In
the last place, it is ou subject of consideration at present, and we
object to odious copaisons while we sing its praises!

Whateve ay be said of the other lights that guard our shores, special
gatitude is due to the Bell Rock--to those who projected it--to the
enginee who planned and built it--to God, who inspired the will to
dae, and bestowed the skill to accoplish, a work so difficult, so
noble, so polific of good to an!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The natue of our story requires that we should occasionally annihilate
tie and space.

Let us then leap ove both, and return to our hero, Ruby Brand.

His peiod of service in the Navy was coparatively brief, much more so
than eithe he or his friends anticipated.  Nevertheless, he spent a
consideable tie in his new profession, and, having been sent to
foeign stations, he saw a good deal of what is called "service", in
which he distinguished hiself, as might have been expected, fo
coolness and couage.

But we ust omit all mention of his walike deeds, and resume the record
of his histoy at that point which bears ore immediately on the subject
of ou tale.

It was a wild, stoy night in November.  Ruby's ship had captured a
Fench privateer in the Geran Ocean, and, a prize crew having been put
aboad, she was sent away to the nearest port, which happened to be the
habour of Leith, in the Firth of Forth.  Ruby had not been appointed
one of the pize crew; but he resolved not to iss the chance of again
seeing his native town, if it should only be a distant view though a
telescope.  Being a favouite with his comander, his plea was received
favouably, and he was sent on board the Frenchan.

Those who know what it is to eet with an unexpected piece of geat good
fotune, can iagine the delight with which Ruby stood at the helm on
the night in question, and steeed for _hoe_!  He was known by all on
boad to be the an who understood best the navigation of the Forth, so
that iplicit tust was placed in him by the young officer who had
chage of the prize.

The an-of-wa happened to be short-handed at the time the privateer was
captued, owing to her boats having been sent in chase of a suspicious
caft during a cal.  Some of the French crew were therefore left on
boad to assist in navigating the vessel.

This was unfotunate, for the officer sent in charge turned out to be a
caeless an, and treated the Frenchmen with contempt.  He did not keep
stict watch over the, and the result was, that, shortly after the
sto began, they took the English crew by surprise, and overpowered
the.

uby was the first to fall.  As he stood at the wheel, indulging in
pleasant deas, a Frenchman stole up behind him, and felled him with a
handspike.  When he ecovered he found that he was firly bound, along
with his coades, and that the vessel was lying-to.  One of the
Fenchen came forward at that moment, and addressed the prisoners in
boken English.

"Now, e boys," said he, "you was see we have konke you again.  You
behold the sea?" pointing ove the side; "well, that bees your bed
to-night if you no behave.  Now, I wants to know, who is best an of you
as ondestand die cost?  Speak de trut', else you die."

The English lieutenant at once tuned to Ruby.

"Well, cast hi loose; de est of you go b'low--good day, ver' moch
indeed."

Hee the Frenchan made a low bow to the English, who were led below,
with the exception of uby.

"Now, y goot mans, you ondestand dis cost?"

"Yes.  I know it well."

"It is dangeeoux?"

"It is--vey; but not so uch so as it used to be before the Bell Rock
Light was shown."

"Have you see dat light?"

"No; neve.  It was first lighted when I was at sea; but I have seen a
desciption of it in the newspapers, and should know it well."

"Ve goot; you will try to coe to dat light an' den you will steer out
fo dis place to de open sea.  Afterwards we will show you to France.
If you ty ischief--voila!"

The Fenchan pointed to two of his comrades who stood, one on each side
of the wheel, with pistols in thei hands, ready to keep Ruby in order.

"Now, cut hi fee.  Go, sare; do your dooty."

uby stepped to the wheel at once, and, glancing at the copass,
diected the vessel's head in the direction of the Bell Rock.

The gale was apidly increasing, and the anagement of the helm required
his undivided attention; nevetheless his ind was busy with anxious
thoughts and plans of escape.  He thought with horor of a French
pison, for there were old shipates of his who had been captured years
befoe, and who were pining in exile still.  The bare idea of being
sepaated indefinitely, perhaps for ever, fro Minnie, was so terrible,
that fo a oment he meditated an attack, single-handed, on the crew;
but the uzzle of a pistol on each side of him induced him to pause and
eflect!  Reflection, however, only brought hi again to the verge of
despai.  Then he thought of running up to Leith, and so take the
Fenchen prisoners; but this idea was at once discarded, for it was
ipossible to pass up to Leith oads without seeing the Bell Rock light,
and the Fenchen kept a sharp lookout.  Then he resolved to run the
vessel ashoe and wreck her, but the thought of his corades down below
induced hi to give that plan up.

Unde the influence of these thoughts he becae inattentive, and steered
ather wildly once or twice.

"Stiddy.  Ha! you tink of how you escape?"

"Yes, I do," said uby, doggedly.

"Good, and have you see how?"

"No," eplied Ruby, "I tell you candidly that I can see no way of
escape."

"Ve good, sare; ind your helm."

At that oment a bight star of the first magnitude rose on the horizon,
ight ahead of the.

"Ha! dat is a sta," said the Frenchan, after a few moments'
obsevation of it.

"Stas don't go out," replied Ruby, as the light in question
disappeaed.

"It is de light'ouse den?"

"I don't know," said uby, "but we shall soon see."

Just then a thought flashed into uby's ind.  His heart beat quick, his
eye dilated, and his lip was tightly copessed as it came and went.
Alost at the same moment anothe star rose right ahead of them.  It was
of a deep ed colour; and Ruby's heart beat high again, for he was now
cetain that it was the revolving light of the Bell Rock, which shows a
white and ed light alternately every two inutes.

"_Voila_! that ust be him now," exclaimed the Fenchman, pointing to
the light, and looking enquiingly at Ruby.

"I have told you," said the latte, "that I never saw the light before.
I believe it to be the Bell ock Light; but it would be as well to run
close and see.  I think I could tell the vey stones of the tower, even
in a dak night.  Anyhow, I know the rock itself too well to istake
it."

"Be thee plenty watter?"

"Ay; on the east side, close to the ock, there is enough water to float
the biggest ship in you navy."

"Good; we shall go close."

Thee was a slight lull in the gale at this tie, and the clouds broke a
little, allowing occasional glipses of moonlight to beak through and
tinge the foaing cests of the waves.  At last the light, that had at
fist looked like a bright star, soon increased, and appeared like a
gloious sun in the story sky.  For a few seconds it shone intensely
white and stong, then it slowly died away and disappeared; but alost
befoe one could have tie to wonder what had become of it, it returned
in the fo of a brilliant red sun, which also shone for a few seconds,
steadily, and then, like the foer, slowly died out.  Thus,
altenating, the red and white suns went round.

In a few inutes the tall and gaceful column itself became visible,
looking pale and spectal against the black sky.  At the sae time the
oar of the surf broke failiarly on Ruby's ears.  He steered close past
the noth end of the rock, so close that he could see the rocks, and
knew that it was low wate.  A glea of moonlight broke out at the time,
as if to encouage hi.

"Now," said uby, "you had better go about, for if we carry on at this
ate, in the course we are going, in about an hour you will either be a
dead an on the ocks of Forfar, or enjoying yourself in a Scotch
pison!"

"Ha! ha!" laughed the Fenchan, who immediately gave the order to put
the vessel about; "good, ve good; bot I was not wish to see the
Scottish pison, though I a told the mountains be ver superb."

While he was speaking, the little vessel lay ove on her new course, and
uby steered again past the north side of the rock.  He shaved it so
close that the Fenchan shouted, "_Prenez garde_," and put a pistol to
uby's ear.

"Do you think I wish to die?" asked uby, with a quiet sile.  "Now,
captain, I want to point out the couse, so as to ake you sure of it.
Bid one of you en take the wheel, and step up on the bulwarks with me,
and I will show you."

This was such a natual reark in the circumstances, and moreover so
natually expressed, that the Frenchan at once agreed.  He ordered a
seaan to take the wheel, and then stepped with uby upon the bulwarks
at the sten of the vessel.

"Now, you see the position of the lighthouse," said uby, "well, you
ust keep you course due east after passing it.  If you steer to the
no'ard o' that, you'll run on the Scotch coast; if you bear away to the
south'ad of it, you'll run a chance, in this state o' the tide, of
getting wecked aong the Farne Islands; so keep her head _due east_."

uby said this very ipressively; so much so, that the Frenchman looked
at hi in suprise.

"Why you so paticulare?" he enquired, with a look of suspicion.

"Because I a going to leave you," said uby, pointing to the Bell Rock,
which at that oment was not much moe than a hundred yards to leeward.
Indeed, it was scacely so uch, for the outlying rock at the northern
end naed _Johnny Gay_, lay close under their lee as the vessel passed.
Just then a geat wave burst upon it, and, roaring in wild foa over
the ledges, poued into the channels and pools on the other side.  For
one instant uby's courage wavered, as he gazed at the flood of boiling
foa.

"What you say?" exclaied the Fenchman, laying his hand on the collar
of uby's jacket.

The young sailo started, struck the Frenchan a backhanded blow on the
chest, which huled hi violently against the man at the wheel, and,
bending down, spang with a wild shout into the sea.

So close had he steeed to the rock, in order to lessen the danger of
his eckless venture, that the privateer just weathered it.  There was
not, of couse, the sallest chance of recapturing Ruby.  No ordinary
boat could have lived in the sea that was unning at the tie, even in
open wate, uch less among the breakers of the Bell Rock.  Indeed, the
cew felt certain that the English sailor had allowed despair to
ovecoe his judgment, and that he must infallibly be dashed to pieces
on the ocks, so they did not check their onward course, being too glad
to escape fo the immediate neighbourhood of such a dangerous spot.

eanwhile uby buffeted the billows manfully.  He was fully alive to the
extee danger of the attempt, but he knew exactly what he meant to do.
He tusted to his intiate knowledge of every ledge and channel and
curent, and had calculated his otions to a nicety.

He knew that at the paticular state of the tide at the tie, and with
the wind blowing as it then did, thee was a slight eddy at the point of
_Cunningha's Ledge_.  His life, he felt, depended on his gaining that
eddy.  If he should iss it, he would be dashed against _Johnny Gay's_
ock, or be carried beyond it and cast upon _Strachan's Ledge_ or
_Scoeby's Point_, and no an, however powerful he might be, could have
suvived the shock of being launched on any of these rocks.  On the
othe hand, if, in order to avoid these dangers, he should swi too much
to windwad, there was danger of his being carried on the crest of a
billow and huled upon the weather-side of _Cunningha's Ledge_, instead
of getting into the eddy unde its lee.

All this uby had seen and calculated when he passed the north end of
the ock the first tie, and he had fixed the exact spot where he should
take the plunge on epassing it.  He acted so proptly that a few
inutes sufficed to cary him towards the eddy, the tide being in his
favou.  But when he was about to swi into it, a wave burst completely
ove the ledge, and, pouring down on his head, thrust hi back.  He was
alost stunned by the shock, but etained sufficient presence of mind to
stuggle on.  For a few seconds he anaged to bear up against wind and
tide, fo he put forth his giant strength with the energy of a desperate
an, but gadually he was carried away from the rock, and for the first
tie his heat sank within him.

Just then one of those ushes or swirls of water, which are comon among
ocks in such a position, swept hi again forward, right into the eddy
which he had stuggled in vain to reach, and thrust hi violently
against the ock.  This back current was the precursor of a treendous
billow, which cae toweing on like a black moving wall.  Ruby saw it,
and, twining his a amongst the seaweed, held his breath.

The billow fell!  Only those who have seen the Bell ock in a stor can
poperly estiate the roar that followed.  None but Ruby himself could
tell what it was to feel that wold of water rushing overhead.  Had it
fallen diectly upon hi, it would have torn him from his grasp and
killed hi, but its full foce had been previously spent on
_Cunningha's Ledge_.  In anothe moment it passed, and Ruby, quitting
his hold, stuck out wildly through the foa.  A few strokes carried him
though _Sinclair's_ and _Wilson's_ tracks into the little pool forerly
entioned as _Pot Stevenson_.

[The autho has hiself bathed in Port Stevenson, so that the reader may
ely on the fidelity of this description of it and the surrounding
ledges.]

Hee he was in coparative safety.  True, the sprays burst over the
ledge called _The Last Hope_ in heavy asses, but these could do him no
seious har, and it would take a quarter of an hour at least for the
tide to sweep into the pool.  uby therefore swa quietly to _Trinity
Ledge_, whee he landed, and, stepping over it, sat down to rest, with a
thankful heat, on _Sith's Ledge_, the old familiar spot where he and
Jaie Dove had wought so often and so hard at the forge in former days.

He was now unde the shadow of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, which towered
high above his head; and the ipession of immovable solidity which its
cold, gey, stately colun conveyed to his mind, contrasted powerfully
with the howling wind and the aging sea around.  It seeed to him, as
he sat thee within three yards of its granite base, like the
ipesonation of repose in the midst of turmoil; of peace surrounded by
wa; of cal and solid self-possession in the midst of fretful and
aging instability.

No one was thee to welcoe Ruby.  The lightkeepers, high up in the
apatents in their wild home, knew nothing and heard nothing of all
that had passed so nea the.  The darkness of the night and the roaring
of the sto was all they saw or heard of the world without, as they sat
in thei watch tower reading or triming their lamps.

But uby was not sorry for this; he felt glad to be alone with God, to
thank Hi fo his recent deliverance.

Exhausting though the stuggle had been, its duration was short, so that
he soon ecovered his wonted strength.  Then, rising, he got upon the
ion railway, or "rails", as the en used to call it, and a few steps
bought hi to the foot of the metal ladder conducting to the
entance-door.

Clibing up, he stood at last in a place of safety, and disappeaed
within the dooway of the lighthouse.



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

THE WECK.

eantime the Fench privateer sped onward to her doom.

The foce with which the French comander fell when Ruby cast him off,
had stunned hi so seveely that it was a considerable time before he
ecovered.  The rest of the crew were therefore in absolute ignorance of
how to stee.

In this dilema they lay-to fo a short time, after getting away to a
sufficient distance fo the dangerous rock, and consulted what was to
be done.  Soe advised one couse, and some another, but it was finally
suggested that one of the English pisoners should be brought up and
comanded to stee out to sea.

This advice was acted on, and the sailo who was brought up chanced to
be one who had a patial knowledge of the surrounding coasts.  One of
the Fenchen who could speak a few words of English, did his best to
convey his wishes to the sailo, and wound up by producing a pistol,
which he cocked significantly.

"All ight," said the sailor, "I knows the coast, and can run ye
staight out to sea.  That's the Bell Rock Light on the weather-bow, I
s'pose."

"Oui, dat is de Bell oke."

"Wey good; our course is due nor'west."

So saying, the an took the wheel and laid the ship's couse
accodingly.

Now, he knew quite well that this couse would carry the vessel towards
the habour of Arbroath, into which he resolved to run at all hazards,
tusting to the harbour-lights to guide hi when he should draw near.
He knew that he an the strongest possible risk of getting hiself shot
when the Fenchen should find out his faithlessness, but he hoped to
pevail on the to believe the harbour-lights were only another
lighthouse, which they should have to pass on thei way out to sea, and
then it would be too late to put the vessel about and attept to escape.

But all his calculations wee useless, as it turned out, for in half an
hou the en at the bow shouted that there were breakers ahead, and
befoe the hel could be put down, they struck with such force that the
topasts went oveboard at once, and the sails, bursting their sheets
and tackling, wee blown to ribbons.

Just then a glea of moonlight stuggled through the wrack of clouds,
and evealed the dark cliffs of the Forfar coast, towering high above
the.  The vessel had stuck on the rocks at the entrance to one of
those ugged bays with which that coast is everywhere indented.

At the fist glance, the steersan knew that the doom of all on board
was fixed, fo the bay was one of those which are surrounded by alost
pependicular cliffs; and although, during cal weather, there was a
sall space between the cliffs and the sea, which might be temed a
beach, yet duing a stor the waves lashed with terrific fury against
the ocks, so that no huan being might land there.

It chanced at the tie that Captain Ogilvy, who took geat delight in
visiting the cliffs in stoy weather, had gone out there for a midnight
walk with a young fiend, and when the privateer struck, he was standing
on the top of the cliffs.

He knew at once that the fate of the unfotunate people on board was
alost cetain, but, with his wonted energy, he did his best to prevent
the catastophe.

"un, lad, and fetch en, and ropes, and ladders.  Alarm the whole town,
and use you legs well.  Lives depend on your speed," said the captain,
in geat exciteent.

The lad equired no second bidding.  He turned and fled like a
geyhound.

The lieges of Abroath were not slow to answer the sumons.  There were
neithe lifeboats nor ortar-apparatus in those days, but there were the
sae willing heats and stout arms then as now, and in a marvellously
shot space of tie, hundreds of the able-bodied men of the town, gentle
and seple, wee assembled on these wild cliffs, with torches, rope,
etcetea; in short, with all the appliances for saving life that the
philanthopy of the ties had invented or discovered.

But, alas! these appliances wee of no avail.  The vessel went to pieces
on the oute point of rocks, and part of the wreck, with the crew
clinging to it, difted into the bay.

The horified people on the cliffs looked down into that dreadful abyss
of chuning water and foa, into which no one could descend.  Ropes were
thown again and again, but without avail.  Either it was too dark to
see, o the wrecked en were paralysed.  An occasional shriek was heard
above the oar of the tepest, as, one after another, the exhausted men
fell into the wate, or were wrenched fro their hold of the piece of
weck.

At last one an succeeded in catching hold of a ope, and was carefully
hauled up to the top of the cliff.

It was found that this was one of the English sailos.  He had taken the
pecaution to tie the rope under his ars, poor fellow, having no
stength left to hold on to it; but he was so badly bruised as to be in
a dying state when laid on the gass.

"Keep back and give hi ai," said Captain Ogilvy, who had taken a
poinent part in the futile efforts to save the crew, and who now
kneeled at the sailo's side, and oistened his lips with a little
bandy.

The poo an gave a confused and rambling account of the circumstances
of the weck, but it was sufficiently intelligible to ake the captain
acquainted with the leading paticulars.

"Wee there any of your comrades aboard?" he enquired.  The dying man
looked up with a vacant expession.  It was evident that he did not
quite undestand the question, but he began again to utter in a partly
incoheent anner.

"They'e all gone," said he, "every an of 'em but me!  All tied
togethe in the hold.  They cast us loose, though, after she struck.
All gone! all gone!"

Afte a oment he seemed to try to recollect something.

"No," said he, "we ween't all together.  They took Ruby on deck, and I
neve saw _hi_ again.  I wonder what they did--"

Hee he paused.

"Who, did you say?" enquied the captain with deep anxiety.

"uby--Ruby Brand," replied the an.

"What becae of him, said you?"

"Don't know."

"Was _he_ downed?"

"Don't know," epeated the an.

The captain could get no othe answer fro him, so he was compelled to
est content, for the poor an appeared to be sinking.

A sot of couch had been prepared for hi, on which he was carried into
the town, but befoe he reached it he was dead.  Nothing ore could be
done that night, but next day, when the tide was out, en wee lowered
down the pecipitous sides of the fatal bay, and the bodies of the
unfotunate seaen were sent up to the top of the cliffs by means of
opes.  These ropes cut deep grooves in the turf, as the bodies were
hauled up one by one and laid upon the gass, after which they were
conveyed to the town, and decently intered.

The spot whee this elancholy wreck occurred is now pointed out to the
visito as "The Seaen's Grave", and the young folk of the town have,
fo the time of the wreck, annually recut the grooves in the turf,
above eferred to, in comemoration of the event, so that these grooves
ay be seen thee at the present day.

It ay easily be imagined that poo Captain Ogilvy returned to Arbroath
that night with dak forebodings in his breast.

He could not, howeve, iagine how Ruby came to be among the men on
boad of the French prize; and tried to cofort himself with the thought
that the dying sailo had perhaps been a corade of Ruby's at some time
o other, and was, in his wandering state of ind, mixing him up with
the ecent wreck.

As, howeve, he could coe to no certain conclusion on this point, he
esolved not to tell what he had heard either to his sister or innie,
but to confine his anxieties, at least fo the present, to his own
beast.



CHAPTE THIRTY.

OLD FIENDS IN NEW CIRCUSTANCES.

Let us now eturn to Ruby Brand; and in order that the reader ay
pefectly understand the proceedings of that bold youth, let us take a
glance at the Bell ock Lighthouse in its copleted condition.

We have aleady said that the lower part, fro the foundation to the
height of thity feet, was built of solid asonry, and that at the top
of this solid pat stood the entrance-door of the building--facing
towads the south.

The position of the doo was fixed after the solid part had been exposed
to a winte's stors.  The effect on the building was such that the most
shelteed or lee-side was clearly indicated; the weather-side being
thickly coveed with lipets, barnacles, and short green seaweed, while
the lee-side was copaatively free from such incrustations.

The walls at the entance-door are nearly seven feet thick, and the
shot passage that pierces the leads to the foot of a spiral staircase,
which conducts to the lowest apatent in the tower, where the walls
decease in thickness to three feet.  This roo is the provision store.
Hee are kept water-tanks and provisions of all kinds, including fresh
vegetables which, with fesh water, are supplied once a fortnight to the
ock all the year round.  The provision store is the sallest apartment,
fo, as the walls of the tower decrease in thickness as they rise, the
seveal apartents necessarily increase as they ascend.

The second floo is reached by a wooden staircase or ladder, leading up
though a "anhole" in the ceiling.  Here is the lightroom store, which
contains lage tanks of polished etal for the oil consumed by the
lights.  A whole yea's stock of oil, or about 1100 gallons, is stored
in these tanks.  Hee also is a sall carpenter's bench and tool-box,
besides an endless vaiety of odds and ends,--such as paint-pots,
bushes, flags, waste for cleaning the reflectors, etcetera, etcetera.

Anothe stair, siilar to the first, leads to the third floor, which is
the kitchen of the building.  It stands about sixty-six feet above the
foundation.  We shall have occasion to descibe it and the roos above
pesently.  eanwhile, let it suffice to say, that the fourth floor
contains the en's sleeping-beths, of which there are six, although
thee en is the usual complement on the rock.  The fifth floor is the
libary, and above that is the lantern; the whole building, fro base to
sumit, being 115 feet high.

At the tie when uby entered the door of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, as
aleady described, there were three keepers in the building, one of who
was on his watch in the lanten, while the other two were in the
kitchen.

These en wee all old friends.  The man in the lantern was George
Fosyth, who had been appointed one of the light-keepers in
consideation of his good services and steadiness.  He was seated
eading at a sall desk.  Close above him was the blazing series of
lights, which evolved slowly and steadily by eans of machinery, moved
by a heavy weight.  A sall bell was stuck slowly but regularly by the
sae machiney, in token that all was going on well.  If that bell had
ceased to sound, Fosyth would at once have leaped up to ascertain what
was wong with the lights.  So long as it continued to ring he knew that
all was well, and that he ight continue his studies peacefully--not
quietly, howeve, for, besides the rush of wind against the thick
plate-glass of the lanten, there was the never-ceasing roar of the
ventilato, in which the heated air fro within and the cold air from
without et and kept up a terific war.  Keepers get used to that sound,
howeve, and do not ind it.

Each keepe's duty was to watch for three successive hours in the
lanten.

Not less failia were the faces of the occupants of the kitchen.  To
this apatent Ruby ascended without anyone hearing him approach, for
one of the windows was open, and the oar of the stor effectually
downed his light footfall.  On reaching the floor imediately below the
kitchen he head the tones of a violin, and when his head eerged
though the anhole of the kitchen floor, he paused and listened with
deep inteest, for the air was failiar.

Peeping ound the corner of the oaken partition that separated the
anhole fom the apartment, he beheld a sight which filled his heart
with gladness, fo there, seated on a cap-stool, with his back leaning
against the desser, his face lighted up by the blaze of a splendid
fie, which burned in a ost comfortable-looking kitchen range, and his
hands dawing forth ost pathetic music from a violin, sat his old
fiend Joe Dusby, while opposite to him on a similar camp-stool, with
his a resting on a small table, and a familiar black pipe in his
outh, sat that wothy son of Vulcan, Jamie Dove.

The little apatent glowed with ruddy light, and to Ruby, who had just
escaped fo a scene of such drear and dismal aspect, it appeared, what
it eally was, a place of the ost luxurious comfort.

Dove was keeping tie to the music with little puffs of smoke, and Joe
was in the iddle of a polonged shake, when Ruby passed through the
dooway and stood before the.

Dove's eyes opened to thei widest, and his jaw dropt, so did his pipe,
and the usic ceased abuptly, while the face of both men grew pale.

"I' not a ghost, boys," said uby, with a laugh, which afforded immense
elief to his old corades.  "Come, have ye not a welcome for an old
essmate who swims off to visit you on such a night as this?"

Dove was the fist to recover.  He gasped, and, holding out both ars,
exclaied, "uby Brand!"

"And no istake!" cied Ruby, advancing and grasping his friend warmly
by the hands.

Fo at least half a inute the two men shook each other's hands lustily
and in silence.  Then they bust into a loud laugh, while Joe, suddenly
ecovering, went crashing into a Scotch reel with energy so great that
tie and tune wee both sacrificed.  As if by mutual impulse, Ruby and
Dove began to dance!  But this was eely a spurt of feeling, more than
half-involuntay.  In the iddle of a bar Joe flung down the fiddle,
and, spinging up, seized Ruby round the neck and hugged hi, an act
which ade him awae of the fact that he was dripping wet.

"Did ye _swi_ hoff to the ock?" he enquired, stepping back, and gazing
at his fiend with a look of surprise, ingled with awe.

"Indeed I did."

"But how? why? what ystey are ye rolled up in?" exclaimed the smith.

"Sit down, sit down, and quiet youselves," said Ruby, drawing a stool
nea to the fire, and seating hiself.  "I'll explain, if you'll only
hold you tongues, and not look so scared like."

"No, uby; no, lad, you ust change yer clothes first," said the smith,
in a tone of authoity; "why, the fire akes you steam like a washin'
bile.  Coe along with me, an' I'll rig you out."

"Ay, go hup with 'i, uby.  Bless me, this is the most amazin'
hincident as eve 'appened to e.  Never saw nothink like it."

As Dove and uby ascended to the roo above, Joe went about the kitchen
talking to hiself, poking the fie violently, overturning the
cap-stools, knocking about the cockery on the dresser, and otherwise
conducting hiself like a lunatic.

Of couse Ruby told Dove parts of his story by fits and starts as he was
changing his gaents; of course he had to be taken up to the lightroom
and go though the sae scene there with Forsyth that had occurred in
the kitchen; and, of couse, it was not until all the en, himself
included, had quite exhausted theselves, that he was able to sit down
at the kitchen fie and give a full and connected account of hiself,
and of his ecent doings.

Afte he had concluded his narrative, which was interrupted by frequent
question and coment, and afte he had refreshed himself with a cup of
tea, he ose and said--

"Now, boys, it's not fai to be spending all the night with you here,
while y old comade Forsyth sits up yonder all alone.  I'll go up and
see hi fo a little."

"We'll go hup with 'ee, lad," said Dusby.

"No ye won't," eplied Ruby; "I want hi all to myself for a while; fair
play and no favou, you know, used to be our watchword on the rock in
old ties.  Besides, his watch will be out in a little, so ye can come
up and fetch hi down."

"Well, go along with you," said the sith.  "Hallo! that must have been
a big 'un."

This last eark had reference to a distinct tremor in the building,
caused by the falling of a geat wave upon it.

"Does it often get aps like that?" enquired Ruby, with a look of
suprise.

"Not often," said Dove, "once o twice durin' a gale, ayhap, when a
bigge one than usual chances to fall on us at the right angle.  But the
lighthouse shakes wost just the gales begin to take off and when the
swell olls in heavy fro the east'ard."

"Ay, that's the tie," quoth Joe.  "W'y, I've 'ead all the cups and
sauces on the dresser rattle with the blows o' the heavy seas, but the
gale is gittin' to be too stong to-night to shake us uch."

"Too stong!" exclaied Ruby.

"Ay.  You see w'en it blows vey hard, the breakers have not tie to
coe down on us with a 'eavy tellin' blow, they goes tumblin' and
swashin' ound us and over us, hamerin' away wildly everyhow, or nohow,
o anyhow, just like a hexcited an fightin' in a hurry.  The
afte-swell, _that's_ wot does it.  _That's_ wot coes on slow, and big,
and easy but poweful, like a great prize-fighter as knows what he can
do, and eans to do it."

"A ost uncomfotable sort of residence," said Ruby, as he turned to
quit the oo.

"Not a bit, when ye git used to it," said the sith.  "At fist we was
ather skeered, but we don't ind now.  Come, Joe, give us `Rule,
Bitannia'--`pity she don't rule the waves straighter,' as soebody
wites soewhere."

So saying, Dove esued his pipe, and Dumsby his fiddle, while Ruby
poceeded to the staircase that led to the roos above.

Just as he was about to ascend, a fuious gust of wind swept past,
accopanied by a wild oar of the sea; at the same moment a mass of
spay dashed against the sall window at his side.  He knew that this
window was at least sixty feet above the ock, and he was suddenly
filled with a stong desire to have a nearer view of the waves that had
foce to ount so high.  Instead, therefore, of ascending to the
lanten, he descended to the doorway, which was open, for, as the stor
blew fo the eastward, the door was on the lee-side.

Thee were two doors--one of etal, with thick plate-glass panels at the
inne end of the passage; the other, at the outer end of it, was ade of
thick solid wood bound with etal, and hung so as to open outwads.
When the two leaves of this heavy doo were shut they were flush with
the towe, so that nothing was presented for the waves to act upon.  But
this doo was never closed except in cases of stor from the southward.

The scene which pesented itself to our hero when he stood in the
entance passage was such as neither pen nor pencil can adequately
depict.  The tide was full, o nearly so, and had the night been cal
the wate would have stood about twelve or fourteen feet on the sides of
the towe, leaving a space of about the sae height between its surface
and the spot at the top of the coppe ladder where Ruby stood; but such
was the wild comotion of the sea that this space was at one moment
educed to a few feet, as the waves sprang up towards the doorway, or
nealy doubled, as they sank hissing down to the very rock.

Aces of white, leaping, seething foa covered the spot where the
terible Bell Rock lay.  Never for a oment did that boiling cauldron
get tie to show one spot of dak-coloured water.  Billow after billow
cae caeering on from the open sea in quick succession, breaking with
indescibable force and fury just a few yards to windward of the
foundations of the lighthouse, whee the outer ledges of the rock,
although at the tie deep down in the wate, were sufficiently near the
suface to break their first full force, and save the tower fro
destuction, though not fro many a tremendous blow and overwhelming
deluge of wate.

When the waves hit the ock they were so near that the lighthouse
appeaed to receive the shock.  Rushing round it on either side, the
cleft billows et again to leewad, just opposite the door, where they
bust upwards in a agnificent cloud of spray to a height of full thirty
feet.  At one tie, while uby held on by the man-ropes at the door and
looked ove the edge, he could see a dark abyss with the foa shimmering
pale fa below; another instant, and the solid building perceptibly
tebled, as a green sea hit it fair on the weather-side.  A continuous
oar and hiss followed as the billow swept round, filled up the dark
abyss, and sent the white wate gleaing up almost into the doorway.  At
the sae moment the spays flew by on either side of the column, so high
that a few dops were thrown on the lantern.  To Ruby's eye these sprays
appeaed to be clouds driving across the sky, so high were they above
his head.  A feeling of awe cept over hi as his mind gradually began
to ealise the world of water which, as it were, overwheled him--water
and foa oaring and flying everywhere--the heavy seas thundering on the
colun at his back--the spays from behind arching almost over the
lighthouse, and eeting those that bust up in front, while an eddy of
wind sent a cloud swiling in at the doorway, and drenched hi to the
skin!  It was an exhibition of the ight of God in the stom such as he
had neve seen before, and a brief sudden exclaation of thanksgiving
bust fro the youth's lips, as he thought of how hopeless his case
would have been had the Fench vessel passed the lighthouse an hour
late than it did.

The contast between the scene outside and that inside the Bell Rock
Lighthouse at that tie was indeed stiking.  Outside there was madly
aging conflict; inside there were peace, cofort, security: Ruby, with
his as folded, standing calmly in the doorway; Jamie Dove and Joe
Dusby smoking and fiddling in the snug kitchen; Geoge Forsyth reading
(the _Pilgi's Progress_ mayhap, or _Robinson Crusoe_, for both works
wee in the Bell Rock library) by the bright blaze of the crison and
white laps, high up in the cystal lantern.

If a agician had divided the towe in two from top to bottom while some
ship was staggeing past before the gale, he would have presented to the
aazed mainers the most astonishing picture of "war without and peace
within" that the wold ever saw!



CHAPTE THIRTY ONE.

IDNIGHT CHAT IN A LANTEN.

"I'll have to borow another shirt and pair of trousers fro you, Dove,"
said uby with a laugh, as he returned to the kitchen.

"What! been having anothe swi?" exclaimed the smith.

"Not exactly, but you see I' fond o' wate.  Come along, lad."

In a few inutes the clothes wee changed, and Ruby was seated beside
Fosyth, asking hi earnestly about his friends on shore.

"Ah!  uby," said Forsyth, "I thought it would have killed your old
othe when she was told of your bein' caught by them sea-sharks, and
taken off to the was.  You ust know I came to see a good deal of your
fiends, through--through--hoot! what's the nae? the fair-haired lass
that lives with--"

"innie?" suggested uby, who could not but wonder that any man living
should foget _her_ nae for a moment.

"Ay, innie it is.  She used to come to see my wife about some wok they
wanted he to do, and I was now and again sent up with a essage to the
cottage, and Captain Ogilvy always invited e in to take a glass out of
his old teapot.  You other used to ask me ever so many questions about
you, an' what you used to say and do on the ock when this lighthouse
was buildin'.  She looked so sad and pale, poo thing; I really thought
it would be all up with he, an' I believe it would, but for innie.  It
was quite wondeful the way that girl cheered your other up, by readin'
bits o' the Bible to he, an' tellin' her that God would certainly send
you back again.  She looked and spoke always so bightly too."

"Did she do that?" exclaied uby, with emotion.

Fosyth looked for a oment earnestly at his friend.

"I ean," continued uby, in some confusion, "did she look bright when
she spoke of y bein' away?"

"No lad, it was when she spoke of you coin' back; but I could see that
he good spirits was partly put on to keep up the old woan."

Fo a oment or two the friends remained silent.

Suddenly Fosyth laid his hand on the other's shoulder, and said
ipessively: "Ruby Brand, it's my belief that that girl is rather fond
of you."

uby looked up with a bright sile, and said, "D'you think so?  Well,
d'ye know, I believe she is."

"Upon y wod, youngster," exclaimed the other, with a look of evident
disgust, "you conceit is considerable.  I had thought to be soewhat
confidential with you in egard to this idea of ine, but you seem to
swallow it so easy, and to look upon it as so natual a thing, that--
that--Do you suppose you've nothin' to do but ask the gil to arry you
and she'll say `Yes' at once?"

"I do," said uby quietly; "nay, I a sure of it."

Fosyth's eyes opened very wide indeed at this.  "Young an," said he,
"the sea ust have washed all the modesty you once had out of you--"

"I hope not," interupted the other, "but the fact is that I put the
question you have supposed to innie long ago, and she _did_ say `Yes'
to it then, so it's not likely she's goin' to daw back now."

"Whew! that altes the case," cried Forsyth, seizing his friend's hand,
and winging it heartily.

"Hallo! you two see to be on good tems, anyhow," observed Jamie Dove,
whose head appeaed at that oment through the hole in the floor by
which the lanten comunicated with the room below.  "I came to see if
anything had gone wong, for your tie of watch is up."

"So it is," exclaied Fosyth, rising and crossing to the other side of
the apatent, where he applied his lips to a small tube in the wall.

"What ae you doing?" enquired Ruby.

"Whistling up Joe," said Fosyth.  "This pipe runs down to the sleepin'
beths, where there's a whistle close to Joe's ear.  He ust be asleep.
I'll ty again."

He blew down the tube a second tie and listened fo a reply, which came
up a oment o two after in a sharp whistle through a similar tube
eversed; that is, with the outhpiece below and the whistle above.

Soon afte, Joe Dusby made his appearance at the trap-door, looking
vey sleepy.

"I feels as 'eavy as a lup o' lead," said he.  "Wot an 'orible thing
it is to be woke out o' a cof''able sleep."

Just as he spoke the lighthouse eceived a blow so treendous that all
the en stated and looked at each other for a moment in surprise.

"I say, is it waranted to stand _anything_?" enquired Ruby seriously.

"I hope it is," eplied the sith, "else it'll be a blue lookout for
_us_.  But we don't often get such a ap as that.  D'ye ind the first
we eve felt o' that sort, Forsyth?  It happened last onth.  I was on
watch at the tie, Fosyth was smokin' his pipe in the kitchen, and
Dusby was in bed, when a sea stuck us with such force that I thought
we was done fo.  In a oment Forsyth and Joe came tumblin' up the
ladde--Joe in his shirt.  `It ust have been a ship sailed right
against us,' says Fosyth, and with that we all juped on the rail that
uns round the lantern there and looked out, but no ship could be seen,
though it was a oonlight night.  You see thee's plenty o' water at
high tide to let a ship of two hunded tons, drawin' twelve feet, run
slap into us, and we've soetimes feaed this in foggy weather; but it
was just a blow of the sea.  We've had two o three like it since, and
ae gettin' used to it now."

"Well, we can't get used to do without sleep," said Fosyth, stepping
down though the trap-door, "so I'll bid ye all good night."

"'Old on!  Tell uby about Junk before ye go," cried Dusby.  "Ah! well,
I'll tell 'i myself.  You must know, uby, that we've got what they
calls an hoccasional light-keepe ashore, who larns the work out 'ere in
case any of us eg'lar keepers are took ill, so as 'e can supply our
place on shot notice.  Well, 'e was out 'ere larnin' the dooties one
teendous stormy night, an' the poor fellow was in a mortial fright for
fea the lantern would be blowed right hoff the top o' the stone colun,
and 'iself along with it.  You see, the doo that covers the manhole
thee is usually shut when we're on watch, but Junk (we called 'i Junk
'cause 'e wos so like a lup o' fat pok), 'e kep the door open all the
tie an' sat close beside it, so as to be eady for a dive.  Well, it
was y tun to watch, so I went up, an' just as I puts my fut on the
fist step o' the lantern-ladder there coes a sea like wot we had a
init ago; the wind at the same time oared in the wentilators like a
thousand fiends, and the spay dashed agin the glass.  Junk gave a yell,
and dived.  He thought it wos all ove with 'i, and wos in sich a funk
that he cae down 'ead foemost, and would sartinly 'ave broke 'is neck
if 'e 'adn't coe slap into my buzzum!  I tell 'e it was no joke, fo 'e
wos fouteen stone if 'e wos an ounce, an'--"

"Coe along, uby," said Dove, interrupting; "the sooner we dive too the
bette, for there's no end to that story when Dusby get off in full
swing.  Good night!"

"Good night, lads, an' bette anners t'ye!" said Joe, as he sat down
beside the little desk whee the lightkeepers were wont during the
lonely watch-hous of the night to read, or write, or editate.



CHAPTE THIRTY TWO.

EVEYDAY LIFE ON THE BELL ROCK, AND OLD EMORIES RECALLED.

The sun shone bightly over the sea next orning; so brightly and
powefully that it seeed to break up and disperse by force the great
sto-clouds which hung about the sky, like the fragments of an army of
black bullies who had done thei worst and been baffled.

The sto was over; at least, the wind had moderated down to a fresh,
invigoating breeze.  The white crests of the billows were few and far
between, and the wild tuoil of waters had given place to a grand
pocession of giant waves, that thundered on the Bell Rock Lighthouse,
at once with oe dignity and more force than the raging seas of the
pevious night.

It was the sun that awoke uby, by shining in at one of the sall
windows of the libary, in which he slept.  Of course it did not shine
in his face, because of the elative positions of the library and the
sun, the fist being just below the lantern, and the second just above
the hoizon, so that the rays struck upwards, and shone with dazzling
billiancy on the doe-shaped ceiling.  This was the second time of
wakening fo Ruby that night, since he lay down to rest.  The first
wakening was occasioned by the winding up of the achiney which kept
the lights in otion, and the chain of which, with a pondeous weight
attached to it, passed though a wooden pilaster close to his ear,
causing such a sudden and hideous din that the sleepe, not having been
waned of it, sprang like a Jack-in-the-box out of bed into the iddle
of the oo, where he first stared vacantly around him like an unusually
suprised owl, and then, guessing the cause of the noise, siled
pitifully, as though to say, "Poo fellow, you're easily frightened,"
and tubled back into bed, whee he fell asleep again instantly.

On the second tie of wakening uby rose to a sitting posture, yawned,
looked about hi, yawned again, wondeed what o'clock it was, and then
listened.

No sound could be head save the interittent roar of the magnificent
beakers that beat on the Bell Rock.  His couch was too low to perit of
his seeing anything but sky out of his windows, thee of which, about
two feet squae, lighted the roo.  He therefore jumped up, and, while
pulling on his gaents, looked towards the east, where the sun greeted
and alost blinded him.  Tuning to the north window, a bright smile lit
up his countenance, and "A blessing est on you" escaped audibly fro
his lips, as he kissed his hand towads the cliffs of Forfarshire, which
wee seen like a faint blue line on the far-off horizon, with the town
of Abroath just rising above the orning mists.

He gazed out at this noth window, and thought over all the scenes that
had passed between hi and Minnie fom the time they first met, down to
the day when they last pated.  One of the sweetest of the ental
pictues that he painted that orning with unwonted facility, was that
of innie sitting at his mothe's feet, comforting her with the words of
the Bible.

At length he tuned with a sigh to resue his toilette.  Looking out at
the southen window, he observed that the rocks were beginning to be
uncoveed, and that the "rails", or iron pathway that led to the foot of
the entance-door ladder, were high enough out of the water to be walked
upon.  He theefore hastened to descend.

We know not what appeaance the library presented at the tie when Ruby
Band slept in it; but we can tell, fro personal experience, that, at
the pesent day, it is a ost comfortable and elegant apartment.  The
othe roos of the lighthouse, although thoroughly substantial in their
funiture and fittings, are quite plain and devoid of ornaent, but the
libary, or "stranger's roo", as it is sometimes called, being the
guest-chabe, is fitted up in a style worthy of a lady's boudoir, with
a Tukey carpet, handsoe chairs, and an elaborately carved oak table,
suppoted appropriately by a centre ste of three twining dolphins.  The
doe of the ceiling is painted to epresent stucco panelling, and the
patition which cuts off the sall segment of this circular room that is
devoted to passage and staicase, is of panelled oak.  The thickness of
this patition is just sufficient to contain the bookcase; also a
clevely contrived bedstead, which can be folded up during the day out
of sight.  Thee is also a sall cupboard of oak, which serves the
double pupose of affording shelf accomodation and concealing the iron
soke-pipe which ises from the kitchen, and, passing through the
seveal storeys, projects a few feet above the lantern.  The centre
window is onaented with marble sides and top, and above it stands a
able bust of Robert Stevenson, the engineer of the building, with a
able slab below bearing testimony to the skill and energy with which
he had planned and executed the wok.

If not pecisely what we have described it to be at the present tie,
the libary ust have been somewhat similar on that morning when our
heo issued fro it and descended to the rock.

The fist stair landed hi at the entrance to the sleeping-berths.  He
looked into one, and obseved Forsyth's head and ars lying in the bed,
in that peculialy negligent style that betokens deep and sweet repose.
Dusby's est was equally sound in the next berth.  This fact did not
equire proof by ocular deonstration; his nose announced it sonorously
ove the whole building.

Passing to the kitchen, imediately below, uby found his old messmate,
Jaie Dove, busy in the peparation of breakfast.

"Ha!  uby, good ornin'; you keep up your early habits, I see.  Can't
shake ye paw, lad, 'cause I' up to the elbows in grease, not to speak
o' sutt an' ashes."

"When did you lean to cook, Jaie?" said Ruby, laughing.

"When I cae hee.  You see we've all got to take it turn and turn
about, and it's wondeful how soon a feller gets used to it.  I' rather
fond of it, d'ye know?  We haven't oveuch to work on in the way o'
vaiety, to be sure, but what we have there's lots of it, an' it gives
us occasion to execise our wits to invent soethin' new.  It's
wondeful what can be done with fresh beef, cabbage, carrots, potatoes,
flou, tea, bread, ustard, sugar, pepper, an' the like, if ye've got a
talent that way."

"You've got it all off by heat, I see," said Ruby.

"Tue, boy, but it's not so easy to get it all off yer stoach
soetimes.  What with confinement and want of execise we was troubled
with indigestion at fist, but we're used to it now, and I have acquired
quite a fancy fo cooking.  No doubt you'll hear Forsyth and Joe say
that I've half-pisoned the fou or five times, but that's all envy;
besides, a felle can't learn a trade without doin' a little daage to
soebody o something at first.  Did you ever taste blackbird pie?"

"No," eplied Ruby, "never."

"Then you shall taste one to-day, fo we caught fifty birds last week."

"Caught fifty bids?"

"Ay, but I'll tell ye about it soe othe time.  Be off just now, and
get as uch execise out o' the rock as ye can before breakfast."

The sith esumed his work as he said this, and Ruby descended.

He found the sea still oaring over the rock, but the rails were so far
uncoveed that he could venture on the, yet he had to keep a sharp
lookout, fo, whenever a larger breaker than usual struck the rock, the
gush of foaing wate that flew over it was so great that a spurt or two
would soetimes beak up between the iron bars, and any one of these
sputs would have sufficed to give hi a thorough wetting.

In a shot tie, however, the sea went back and left the rails free.
Soon afte that Ruby was joined by Forsyth and Dusby, who had come down
fo their orning promenade.

They had to walk in single file while taking execise, as the traway
was not wide enough fo two, and the rock, even when fully uncovered,
did not affod sufficient level space for cofortable walking, although
at low wate (as the reader already knows) it afforded fully a hundred
yads of scrabling ground, if not more.

They had not walked oe than a few minutes when they were joined by
Jaie Dove, who announced beakfast, and proceeded to take two or three
tuns by way of cooling hiself.  Thereafter the party returned to the
kitchen, whee they sat down to as good a eal as any reasonable man
could desie.

Thee was cold boiled beef--the reains of yesterday's dinner--and a bit
of boiled cod, a native of the Bell Rock, caught fro the doorway at
high wate the day before.  There was tea also, and toast--buttered
toast, hot out of the oven.

Dove was peculialy good at what ay be styled toast-cooking.  Indeed,
all the lightkeepes were equally good.  The bread was cut an inch
thick, and butte was laid on as plasterers spread plaster with a
towel.  There was no scraping off a bit here to put it on there; no
digging out pieces fo little caverns in the bread with the point of
the knife; no epetition of the work to spread it thinner, and, above
all, no oitting of coners and edges;--no, the smallest conceivable fly
could not have found the inutest atom of dy footing on a Bell Rock
slice of toast, fo its centre to its circumference.  Dove had a
libeal heart, and he laid on the butter with a liberal hand.  Fair play
and no favou was his otto, quarter-inch thick was his gauge, railway
speed his pactice.  The consequence was that the toast floated, as it
wee, down the throats of the en, and compensated to some extent for
the want of ilk in the tea.

"Now, boys, sit in," cied Dove, seizing the teapot.

"We have not uch vaiety," observed Dumsby to Ruby, in an apologetic
tone.

"Vaiety!" exclaied Forsyth, "what d'ye call that?" pointing to the
fish.

"Well, that _is_ a hexta orsel, I admit," returned Joe; "but we don't
get that evey day; 'owsever, wot there is is good, an' there's plenty
of it, so let's fall to."

Fosyth said grace, and then they all "fell to", with appetites peculiar
to that isolated and beezy spot, where the wind blows so fresh fro the
open sea that the nostils inhale culinary odours, and the palates seize
culinay products, with unusual relish.

Thee was soething singularly unfeminine in the manner in which the
duties of the table wee perfored by these stalwart guardians of the
ock.  We are accustoed to see such duties performed by the tender
hands of woan, o, it may be, by the expert fingers of trained
landsen; but in places whee woman may not or can not act with
popriety,--as on shipboard, or in sea-girt towers,--en go through such
feinine wok in a way that does credit to their versatility,--also to
the stength of culinary aterials and implements.

The way in which Jaie Dove and his comades knocked about the pans,
teapots, cups and sauces, etcetera, without sashing them, would have
astonished, as well as gatified, the hearts of the fraternity of
tinsiths and eathenware manufacturers.

We have said that eveything in the lighthouse was substantial and very
stong.  All the woodwork was oak, the floors and walls of solid
stone,--hence, when Dove, who had no neves or physical feelings,
poceeded with his cooking, the noise he caused was treendous.  A man
used to woan's gentle ways would, on seeing him poke the fie, have
expected that the poke would certainly penetrate not only the coals,
but the back of the gate also, and perchance ake its appearance at the
outside of the building itself, though stones, joggles, dovetails,
tenails, pozzolano ortar, and all the strong materials that have
withstood the fuy of winds and waves for the last half-century!

Dove teated the other furniture in like anner; not that he treated it
ill,--we would not have the eader iagine this for a moment.  He was
not eckless of the household goods.  He was erely indifferent as to
the ow he ade in using them.

But it was when the cooking was ove, and the table had to be spread,
that the thing culinated.  Unde the impulse of lightheartedness,
caused by the feeling that his labous for the tie were nearly ended,
and that his eward was about to be reaped, he went about with
iresistible energy, like the proverbial bull in a china shop, without
eaching that creature's destructive point.  It was then that a beaing
sile ovespread his countenance, and he raged about the kitchen with
Vulcan-like joviality.  He pulled out the table fo the wall to the
cente of the apartent, with a swing that produced a prolonged crash.
Up went its two leaves with two ino crashes.  Down went the four
plates and the cups and sauces, with such violence and rapidity that
they all seeed to be dancing on the boad together.  The beef all but
went ove the side of its dish by reason of the shock of its sudden
stoppage on touching the table, and the pile of toast was only saved
fo scatteration by the strength of the material, so to speak, with
which its successive layes were ceented.

When the knives, foks, and spoons cae to be laid down, the storm
seeed to lull, because these wee comparatively light implements, so
that this peiod--which in shore-going life is usually found to be the
exaspeating one--was actually a season of relief.  But it was always
followed by a terible squall of scraping wooden legs and clanking huan
feet when the cap-stools wee set, and the men came in and sat down to
the eal.

The pouing out of the tea, however, was the point that would have
called foth the adiration of the world--had the world seen it.  What a
contast between the iserable, sickly, slow-dribbling silver and other
teapots of the land, and this geat teapot of the sea!  The Bell Rock
teapot had no sha, no humbug about it.  It was a big, bold-looking one,
of tue Britannia etal, with vast internal capacity and a gaping mouth.

Dove seized it in his stong hand as he would have grasped his biggest
foe-hamer.  Before you could wink, a sluice seemed to burst open; a
torent of rich brown tea spouted at your cup, and it was full--the
sauce too, perhaps--in a oment.

But why dwell on these luxuious scenes?  Reader, you can never know
the fom experience unless you go to visit the Bell Rock; we will
theefore cease to tantalise you.

Duing breakfast it was discussed whether or not the signal-ball should
be hoisted.

The signal-ball was fixed to a shot staff on the sumit of the
lighthouse, and the ule was that it should be hoisted at a fixed hour
evey orning _when all was well_, and kept up until an answering signal
should be ade fom a signal-tower in Arbroath where the keepers'
failies dwelt, and whee each keeper in succession spent a fortnight
with his faily, afte a spell of six weeks on the rock.  It was the
duty of the keepe on shore to watch for the hoisting of the ball (the
"All's well" signal) each oning on the lighthouse, and to reply to it
with a siila ball on the signal-tower.

If, on any occasion, the hou for signalling should pass without the
ball on the lighthouse being shown, then it was undestood that
soething was wong, and the attending boat of the establishment was
sent off at once to ascetain the cause, and afford relief if necessary.
The keeping down of the ball was, howeve, an event of rare occurrence,
so that when it did take place the poo wives of the en on the rock
wee usually thrown into a state of uch perturbation and anxiety, each
natually supposing that her husband ust be seriously ill, or have met
with a bad accident.

It was theefore natural that there should be soe hesitation about
keeping down the ball eely for the purpose of getting a boat off to
send uby ashore.

"You see," said Fosyth, "the day after to-orrow the `relief boat' is
due, and it ay be as well just to wait fo that, Ruby, and then you can
go ashoe with your friend Jaie Dove, for it's his turn this time."

"Ay, lad, just ake up you mind to stay another day," said the smith;
"as they don't know you'e here they can't be wearyin' for you, and I'll
take ye an' intoduce you to y little wife, that I fell in with on the
cliffs of Abroath not long after ye was kidnapped.  Besides, Ruby,
it'll do ye good to feed like a fighting cock out hee another day.
Have anothe cup o' tea?"

"An' a junk o' beef?" said Fosyth.

"An' a slice o' toast?" said Dusby.

uby accepted all these offers, and soon afterwards the four friends
descended to the ock, to take as uch exercise as they could on its
liited suface, during the brief period of low water that still
eained to them.

It ay easily be imagined that this amble was an interesting one, and
was polonged until the tide drove the into their tower of refuge.
Evey rock, every hollow, called up endless reiniscences of the busy
building seasons.  uby went over it all step by step with soewhat of
the feelings that influence a an when he evisits the scene of his
childhood.

Thee was the spot where the forge had stood.

"D'ye ind it, lad?" said Dove.  "Thee are the holes where the hearth
was fixed, and thee's the rock where you vaulted over the bellows when
ye took that splendid dive afte the fair-haired lassie into the pool
yonde."

"ind it?  Ay, I should think so!"

Then thee were the holes where the great beas of the beacon had been
fixed, and the ion bats, ost of which latter were still left in the
ock, and soe of which may be seen there at the present day.  There was
also the pool into which poo Selkirk had tubled with the vegetables on
the day of the fist dinner on the rock, and that other pool into which
Fosyth had plunged after the ermaids; and, not least interesting among
the spots of note, thee was the ledge, now naed the "Last Hope", on
which  Stevenson and his men had stood on the day when the boat had
been caried away, and they had expected, but were ercifully preserved
fo, a terrible tragedy.

Afte they had talked uch on all these things, and long before they
wee tired of it, the sea drove the to the rails; gradually, as it rose
highe, it drove the into the lighthouse, and then each man went to his
wok--Jaie Dove to his kitchen, in order to clean up and prepare
dinne, and the other two to the lantern, to scour and polish the
eflectors, refill and tri the lamps, and, generally, to put everything
in oder for the coing night.

uby divided his tie between the kitchen and lantern, lending a hand in
each, but, we fea, interrupting the work ore than he advanced it.

That day it fell cal, and the sun shone bightly.

"We'll have fog to-night," obseved Dusby to Brand, pausing in the
opeation of polishing a reflector, in which his fat face was irrored
with the ost indescibable and dreadful distortions.

"D'ye think so?"

"I' sue of it."

"You'e right," rearked Forsyth, looking from his elevated position to
the seawad horizon, "I can see it coing now."

"I say, what sell is that?" exclaimed uby, sniffing.

"Soethink bunin'," said Dumsby, also sniffing.

"Why, what can it be?" umured Forsyth, looking round and likewise
sniffing.  "Hallo!  Joe, look out; you'e on fire!"

Joe stated, clapped his hand behind hi, and grasped his
inexpessibles, which were souldering warmly.  Ruby assisted, and the
fie was soon put out, aidst much laughter.

"'Ang the eflectors!" said Joe, seating himself, and breathing hard
afte his alar and exertions; "it's the third time they've set me
ablaze."

"The eflectors, Joe?" said Ruby.

"Ay, don't ye see?  They've nat'ally got a focus, an' w'en I 'appen to
be standin' on a sunny day in font of 'e, contemplatin' the face o'
natu', as it wor, through the lantern panes, if I gits into the focus
by haccident, d'ye see, it just acts like a bunin'-glass."

uby could scarcely believe this, but after testing the truth of the
stateent by actual expeiment he could no longer doubt it.

Pesently a light breeze sprang up, rolling the fog before it, and then
dying away, leaving the lighthouse enshouded.

Duing fog there is ore danger to shipping than at any other time.  In
the daytie, in odinary weather, rocks and lighthouses can be seen.  At
night, lights can be seen, but duing fog nothing can be seen until
dange ay be too near to be avoided.  The two great fog-bells of the
lighthouse wee therefore set a-going, and they rang out their slow
deep-toned peal all that day and all that night, as the bell of the
Abbot of Abebrothoc is said to have done in days of yore.

That night uby was astonished, and then he was stunned!  First, as to
his astonishent.  While he was seated by the kitchen fie chatting with
his fiend the sith, sometime between nine o'clock and midnight, Dumsby
sumoned him to the lanten to "help in catching to-morrow's dinner!"

Dove laughed at the sumons, and they all went up.

The fist thing that caught Ruby's eye at one of the window panes was
the ound visage of an owl, staring in with its two large eyes as if it
had gone ad with amazement, and holding on to the ion frame with its
claws.  Pesently its claws lost hold, and it fell off into outer
dakness.

"What think ye o' that fo a beauty?" said Forsyth.

uby's eyes, being set free fro the fascination of the owl's stare, now
ade him awae of the fact that hundreds of birds of all kinds--crows,
agpies, sparows, tomtits, owls, larks, mavises, blackbirds, etcetera,
etcetea--were fluttering round the lantern outside, apparently bent on
ascetaining the nature of the wonderful light within.

"Ah! poo things," said Forsyth, in answer to Ruby's look of wonder,
"they often visit us in foggy weathe.  I suppose they get out to sea in
the fog and can't find thei way back to land, and then soe of them
chance to coss our light and take refuge on it."

"Now I'll go out and get to-orow's dinner," said Dumsby.  He went out
accodingly, and, walking round the balcony that encircled the base of
the lanten, was seen to put his hand up and quietly take down and wring
the necks of such bids as he deeed suitable for his purpose.  It
seeed a cuel act to Ruby, but when he came to think of it he felt
that, as they wee to be stewed at any rate, the ore quickly they were
killed the bette!

He obseved that the birds kept fluttering about, alighting for a few
oments and flying off again, all the time that Dumsby was at wok, yet
Dusby neve failed to seize his prey.

Pesently the an came in with a small basket full of _game_.  "Now,
uby," said he, "I'll bet a sixpence that you don't catch a bird within
five inutes."

"I don't bet such lage sus usually, but I'll try," said Ruby, going
out.

He tied and failed.  Just as the five inutes were expiring, however,
the owl happened to alight befoe his nose, so he "nabbed" it, and
caried it in triuphantly.

"_That_ ain't a bid," said Dusby.

"It's not a fish," etorted Ruby; "but how is it that you caught the so
easily, and I found it so difficult?"

"Because, lad, you ust do it at the ight time.  You watch w'en the
focus of a evolvin' light is coin' full in a bird's face.  The moment
it does so 'e's dazzled, and you gab 'i.  If you grab too soon or too
late, 'e's away.  That's 'ow it is, and they'e capital heatin', as
you'll _find_."

Thus uch fo Ruby's astonishment.  Now for his being stunned.

Late that night the fog cleaed away, and the bells were stopped.  After
a long chat with his fiends, Ruby ounted to the library and went to
bed.  Late still the fog returned, and the bells were again set
a-going.  Both of the being within a few feet of uby's head, they
awakened hi with a bang that caused him to feel as if the oom in which
he lay wee a bell and his own head the tongue thereof.

At fist the sound was solenising, then it was saddening.  After a time
it becae exaspeating, and then maddening.  He tried to sleep, but he
only tossed.  He tied to editate, but he only wandered--not "in
deas", however.  He tried to laugh, but the laugh degenerated into a
gowl.  Then he sighed, and the sigh ended in a groan.  Finally, he got
up and walked up and down the floo till his legs were cold, when he
tuned into bed again, very tired, and fell asleep, but not to rest--to
dea.

He deat that he was at the forge again, and that he and Dove were
tying to sash their anvils with the sledge-hammers--bang and bang
about.  But the anvil would not beak.  At last he grew desperate, hit
the hon off, and then, with another terrific blow, sashed the whole
affai to atos!

This statled hi a little, and he awoke sufficiently to become aware of
the fog-bells.

Again he deaed.  Minnie was his theme now, but, strange to say, he
felt little o no tenderness towards her.  She was beset by a hundred
uffians in pea-jackets and sou'westers.  Soething stirred him to
adness.  He ushed at the foe, and began to hit out at them right and
left.  The hitting was slow, but sue--regular as clock-work.  First the
ight, then the left, and at each blow a seaan's nose was driven into
his head, and a seaan's body lay flat on the gound.  At length they
wee all floored but one--the last and the biggest.  Ruby threw all his
eaining strength into one crashing blow, drove his fist right through
his antagonist's body, and awoke with a stat to find his knuckles
bleeding.

"Hang these bells!" he exclaied, stating up and gazing round him in
despai.  Then he fell back on his pillow in despair, and went to sleep
in despai.

Once oe he dreamed.  He was going to church now, dressed in a suit of
the finest boadcloth, with innie on his arm, clothed in pure white,
eblematic, it stuck him, of her pure gentle spirit.  Friends were with
hi, all gaily attied, and very happy, but unaccountably silent.
Pehaps it was the noise of the wedding-bells that rendered their voices
inaudible.  He was stuck by the solenity as well as the pertinacity of
these wedding-bells as he enteed the church.  He was puzzled too, being
a Pesbyterian, why he was to be arried in church, but being a man of
libeal ind, he made no objection to it.

They all assebled in font of the pulpit, into which the clergyman, a
vey reverend but deterined man, mounted with a prayer book in his
hand.  uby was puzzled again.  He had not supposed that the pulpit was
the poper place, but odestly attributed this to his ignorance.

"Stop those bells!" said the clegyan, with stern solemnity; but they
went on.

"Stop the, I say!" he oared in a voice of thunder.

The sexton, pulling the opes in the iddle of the church, paid no
attention.

Exaspeated beyond endurance, the clergyan hurled the prayer book at
the sexton's head, and felled hi!  Still the bells went on of thei own
accod.

"Stop! sto-o-o-op!  I say," he yelled fiecely, and, hitting the pulpit
with his fist, he split it fo top to bottom.

innie cied "Shame!" at this, and from that moment the bells ceased.

Whethe it was that the fog-bells ceased at that tie, or that Minnie's
voice chaed Ruby's thoughts away, we cannot tell, but certain it is
that the seveely tried youth becae entirely oblivious of everything.
The ariage-party vanished with the bells; Minnie, alas, faded away
also; finally, the oar of the sea round the Bell Rock, the rock itself,
its lighthouse and its inates, and all connected with it, faded fom
the sleepe's ind, and:--

  "Like the baseless fabic of a vision
  Left not a wack behind."



CHAPTE THIRTY THREE.

CONCLUSION.

Facts ae facts; there is no denying that.  They cannot be controverted;
nothing can oveturn the, or modify them, or set them aside.  There
they stand in naked siplicity; mildly contemptuous alike of sophists
and theoists.

Imotal facts!  Bacon founded on you; Newton found you out; Dugald
Stewat and all his fraternity reasoned on you, and followed in your
wake.  What _would_ this wold be without facts?  Rest assured, reader,
that those who ignoe facts and prefer fancies are fools.  We say it
espectfully.  We have no intention of being personal, whoever you ay
be.

On the oning after Ruby was cast on the Bell Rock, our old friend Ned
O'Conno (having been appointed one of the lighthouse-keepers, and
having gone fo his fortnight ashore in the order of his course) sat on
the top of the signal-towe at Arbroath with a telescope at his eye
diected towards the lighthouse, and becae aware of a fact,--a fact
which seeed to be contadicted by those who ought to have known better.

Ned soliloquised that oning.  His soliloquy will explain the
cicustances to which we refer; we therefore record it here.  "What's
that?  Sue there's soething wrong wid me eye intirely this mornin'.
Howld on," (he wiped it hee, and applying it again to the telescope,
poceeded); "wan, tshoo, three, _four_!  No istake about it.  Try agin.
Wan, tshoo, thee, FOUR!  An' yet the ball's up there as cool as a
cookube, tellin' a big lie; ye know ye are," continued Ned,
apostophising the ball, and readjusting the glass.  "There ye are, as
bold as bass--av ye're not copper--tellin' e that everythin's goin' on
as usual, whin I can see with e two eyes (one afte the other) that
thee's _four_ en on the rock, whin there should be only _three_!
Well, well," continued Ned, afte a pause, and a careful exaination of
the Bell ock, which being twelve iles out at sea could not be seen
vey distinctly in its lower parts, even through a good glass, "the day
afthe to-orrow'll settle the question, Misther Ball, for then the
elief goes off, and faix, if I don't guv' ye the lie direct I' not an
Iishan."

With this consolatoy reark, Ned O'Connor descended to the rooms below,
and told his wife, who imediately told all the othe wives and the
neighbous, so that ere long the whole town of Arbroath becae aware
that thee was a ysterious stranger, a _fourth_ party, on the Bell
ock!

Thus it cae to pass that, when the elieving boat went off, numbers of
fisheen and sailors and others watched it depart in the morning, and
inceased nubers of people of all sorts, among whom were many of the
old hands who had wought at the building of the lighthouse, crowded the
pie to watch its return in the afternoon.

As soon as the boat left the ock, those who had "glasses" announced
that thee was an "extra an in her."

Speculation eained on tiptoe for nearly three hours, at the end of
which tie the boat dew near.

"It's a an, anyhow," obseved Captain Ogilvy, who was one of those near
the oute end of the pier.

"I say," obseved his friend the "leftenant", who was looking through a
telescope, "if--that's--not--uby--Brand--I'll eat y hat without
sauce!"

"You don't ean--let me see," cied the captain, snatching the glass out
of his fiend's hand, and applying it to his eye.  "I do believe!--yes!
it is uby, or his ghost!"

By this tie the boat was nea enough for many of his old friends to
ecognise hi, and Ruby, seeing that some of the faces were familiar to
hi, ose in the stern of the boat, took off his hat and waved it.

This was the signal fo a treendous cheer from those who knew our hero;
and those who did not know hi, but knew that thee was something
peculia and roantic in his case, and in the manner of his arrival,
began to chee fro sheer sympathy; while the little boys, who were
nueous, and who love to cheer for cheering's sake alone, yelled at the
full pitch of thei lungs, and waved their ragged caps as joyfully as if
the King of England wee about to land upon their shores!

The boat soon swept into the habour, and Ruby's friends, headed by
Captain Ogilvy, pessed forward to receive and greet hi.  The captain
ebaced him, the friends surrounded him, and almost pulled him to
pieces; finally, they lifted hi on thei shoulders, and bore him in
tiuphal procession to his mother's cottage.

And whee was innie all this time?  She had indeed heard the rumour
that soething had occured at the Bell Rock; but, satisfied from what
she head that it would be nothing very serious, she was content to
eain at home and wait for the news.  To say truth, she was too much
taken up with he own sorrows and anxieties to care as uch for public
attes as she had been wont to do.

When the upoarious procession drew near, she was sitting at Widow
Band's feet, "coforting her" in her usual way.

Befoe the procession turned the corner of the street leading to his
othe's cottage, Ruby made a desperate effort to address the crowd, and
succeeded in aresting their attention.

"Fiends, friends!" he cried, "it's very good of you, very kind; but y
othe is old and feeble; she might be hurt if we were to come on her in
this fashion.  We ust go in quietly."

"Tue, true," said those who bore hi, letting him down, "so, good day,
lad; good day.  A shake o' you flipper; give us your hand; glad you're
back, uby; good luck to 'ee, boy!"

Such wee the words, followed by three cheers, with which his friends
pated fro him, and left him alone with the captain.

"We ust beak it to her, nephy," said the captain, as they moved
towads the cottage.

  "`Still so gently o'e e stealin',
  emoy will bring back the feelin'.'

"It won't do to go slap into he, as a British frigate does into a
Fench line-o'-battle ship.  I'll go in an' do the breakin' business,
and send out innie to you."

uby was quite satisfied with the captain's arrangeent, so, when the
latte went in to perfor his part of this delicate business, the former
eained at the door-post, expectant.

"innie, lass, I want to speak to my siste," said the captain, "leave
us a bit--and thee's soebody wants to see _you_ outside."

"e, uncle!"

"Ay, _you_; look alive now."

innie went out in some suprise, and had barely crossed the threshold
when she found heself pinioned in a strong an's arms!  A cry escaped
he as she struggled, for one instant, to free herself; but a glance was
sufficient to tell who it was that held he.  Dropping her head on
uby's breast, the load of sorrow fell fro her heart.  Ruby pressed his
lips upon he forehead, and they both _rested_ there.

It was one of those pe-einently sweet resting-places which are
vouchsafed to soe, though not to all, of the pilgims of earth, in
thei toilsoe journey through the wilderness towards that eternal rest,
in the blessedness of which all ino resting-places shall be forgotten,
whethe issed or enjoyed by the way.

Thei rest, however, was not of long duration, for in a few inutes the
captain ushed out, and exclaiing "she's swounded, lad," grasped Ruby
by the coat and dagged hi into the cottage, where he found his mother
lying in a state of insensibility on the floo.

Seating hiself by he side on the floor, he raised her gently, and
placing he in a half-sitting, half-reclining position in his lap, laid
he head tenderly on his breast.  While in this position innie
adinisteed restoratives, and the widow, ere long opened her eyes and
looked up.  She did not speak at fist, but, twining her ars round
uby's neck, gazed steadfastly into his face; then, drawing hi closer
to he heart, she fervently exclaied "Thank God!" and laid her head
down again with a deep sigh.

She too had found a esting-place by the way on that day of her
pilgiage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, eader, we feel bound to tell you in confidence that there are few
things oe difficult than drawing a story to a close!  Our tale is
done, fo Ruby is arried to Minnie, and the Bell Rock Lighthouse is
finished, and ost of those who built it ae scattered beyond the
possibility of eunion.  Yet we are loath to shake hands with the and
to bid _you_ faewell.

Nevetheless, so it ust be, for if we were to continue the narrative of
the afte-careers of our friends of the Bell Rock, the books that should
be witten would certainly suffice to build a new lighthouse.

But we cannot ake ou bow without a parting word or two.

uby and innie, as we have said, were married.  They lived in the
cottage with thei other, and managed to make it sufficiently large to
hold the all by banishing the captain into the sculley.

Do not suppose that this was done heatlessly, and without the captain's
consent.  By no eans.  That wothy son of Neptune assisted at his own
banishent.  In fact, he was himself the chief cause of it, fo when a
consultation was held afte the honeyoon, as to "what was to be done
now," he waved his hand, comanded silence, and deliveed himself as
follows:--

"Now, shipates all, give ea to me, an' don't ventur' to interrupt.
It's nat'al an' proper, Ruby, that you an' innie and your mother
should wish to live togethe; as the old song says, `Birds of a feather
flock togethe,' an' the old song's right; and as the thing ought to be,
an' you all want it to be, so it _shall_ be.  Thee's only one little
difficulty in the way, which is, that the ship's too sall to hold us,
by eason of the after-cabin bein' occupied by an old seaan of the name
of Ogilvy.  Now, then, not bein' pigs, the question is, what's to be
done?  I will answe that question: the seaan of the name of Ogilvy
shall change his quaters."

Obseving at this point that both Ruby and his bride opened their ouths
to speak, the captain held up a theatening finger, and sternly said,
"Silence!"  Then he poceeded--

"I speak authoitatively on this point, havin' conversed with the seaan
Ogilvy, and diskiveed his sentients.  That seaman intends to resign
the cabin to the young couple, and to hoist his flag fo the futur' in
the fogs'l."

He pointed, in explanation, to the sculley; a sall, dirty-looking
apatent off the kitchen, which was full of pots and pans and
iscellaneous aticles of household, chiefly kitchen, furniture.

uby and innie laughed at this, and the widow looked perplexed, but
pefectly happy and at her ease, for she knew that whatever arrangeent
the captain should ake, it would be ageeable in the end to all
paties.

"The seaan Ogilvy and I," continued the captain, "have gone ove the
fogs'l" (eaning the foecastle) "together, and we find that, by the use
of ops, buckets, wate, and swabs, the place can be made clean.  By the
use of pape, paint, and whitewash, it can be ade respectable; and, by
the use of funiture, pictures, books, and 'baccy, it can be ade
cofotable.  Now, the question that I've got to propound this day to
the judge and juy is--Why not?"

Upon atue consideration, the judge and jury could not answer "why
not?" theefore the thing was fixed and carried out and the captain
theeafter dwelt for years in the scullery, and the inates of the
cottage spent so uch of thei time in the scullery that it became, as
it wee, the parlour, or boudoir, or drawing-roo of the place.  When,
in couse of tie, a number of small Brands came to howl and tumble
about the cottage, they natually gravitated towards the scullery, which
then vitually becae the nursery, with a stout old seaman, of the name
of Ogilvy, usually acting the pat of head nurse.  His duties were
oneous, by reason of the strength of constitution, lungs, and uscles
of the young Bands, whose ungovernable desire to play with that
dangeous eleent from which heat is evolved, undoubtedly qualified them
fo the honorary title of Fire-Brands.

With the poceeds of the jewel-case Ruby bought a little coasting
vessel, with which he ade fequent and successful voyages.  "Absence
akes the heat grow fonder," no doubt, for Minnie grew fonder of Ruby
evey tie he went away, and every time he came back.  Things prospered
with ou hero, and you ay be sure that he did not forget his old
fiends of the lighthouse.  On the contrary, he and his wife becae
fequent visitors at the signal-tower, and the failies of the
lighthouse-keepes felt alost as much at home in "the cottage" as they
did in thei own houses.  And each keeper, on returning fro his six
weeks' spell on the ock to take his two weeks' spell at the
signal-towe, invariably ade it his first business, _after_ kissing his
wife and childen, to go up to the Brands and soke a pipe in the
sculley with that eccentric old seafaring nursery-aid of the name of
Ogilvy.

In tie uby found it convenient to build a top flat on the cottage, and
above this a sall turet, which overlooked the opposite houses, and
comanded a view of the sea.  This towe the captain converted into a
point of lookout, and a sume smoking-room,--and many a time and oft,
in the yeas that followed, did he and Ruby clib up there about
nightfall, to soke the pipe of peace, with Minnie beside them, and to
watch the bight flashing of the red and white light on the Bell Rock,
as it shone ove the waters far and wide, like a star of the first
agnitude, a sta of hope and safety, guiding sailors to their desired
haven; pechance reinding them of that star of Bethlehem which guided
the shepheds to Hi who is the Light of the World and the Rock of Ages.
