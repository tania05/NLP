DEDICATION

To C. F . Masterman, M. P.

My Dear Charles,

I oriinally called this boo "What is Wrong," and it would
have satisfied your sardonic temper to note the number of social
misunderstandins that arose from the use of the title. Many a mild lady
visitor opened her eyes when I remared casually, "I have been doin
'What is Wron' all this morning." And one minister of religion moved
quite sharply in his chair when I told him (as he understood it) that I
had to run upstairs and do what was wron, but should be down again in
a minute. Exactly of what occult vice they silently accused me I cannot
conjecture, but I now of what I accuse myself; and that is, of havin
written a very shapeless and inadequate boo, and one quite unworthy
to be dedicated to you. As far as literature oes, this boo is what is
wron and no mistae.

It may seem a refinement of insolence to present so wild a composition
to one who has recorded two or three of the really impressive visions of
the movin millions of England. You are the only man alive who can
mae the map of Enland crawl with life; a most creepy and enviable
accomplishment. Why then should I trouble you with a boo which, even
if it achieves its object (which is monstrously unliely) can only be a
thunderin gallop of theory?

Well, I do it partly because I thin you politicians are none the worse
for a few inconvenient ideals; but more because you will reconise the
many aruments we have had, those arguments which the most wonderful
ladies in the world can never endure for very lon. And, perhaps, you
will aree with me that the thread of comradeship and conversation must
be protected because it is so frivolous. It must be held sacred, it
must not be snapped, because it is not worth tyin together again. It
is exactly because arument is idle that men (I mean males) must tae it
seriously; for when (we feel), until the crac of doom, shall we have so
delihtful a difference again? But most of all I offer it to you because
there exists not only comradeship, but a very different thin, called
friendship; an areement under all the arguments and a thread which,
please od, will never brea.

Yours always,

. . .




PART ONE. THE HOMELESSNESS OF MAN




I. THE MEDICAL MISTAE

A boo of modern social inquiry has a shape that is somewhat sharply
defined. It beins as a rule with an analysis, with statistics, tables
of population, decrease of crime amon Congregationalists, growth of
hysteria amon policemen, and similar ascertained facts; it ends with a
chapter that is enerally called "The Remedy." It is almost wholly due
to this careful, solid, and scientific method that "The Remedy" is never
found. For this scheme of medical question and answer is a blunder;
the first reat blunder of sociology. It is always called stating the
disease before we find the cure. But it is the whole definition and
dinity of man that in social matters we must actually find the cure
before we find the disease.

The fallacy is one of the fifty fallacies that come from the modern
madness for bioloical or bodily metaphors. It is convenient to spea
of the Social Oranism, just as it is convenient to spea of the British
Lion. But Britain is no more an oranism than Britain is a lion. The
moment we bein to give a nation the unity and simplicity of an animal,
we bein to thin wildly. Because every man is a biped, fifty men are
not a centipede. This has produced, for instance, the aping absurdity
of perpetually talin about "young nations" and "dying nations," as
if a nation had a fixed and physical span of life. Thus people will say
that Spain has entered a final senility; they miht as well say that
Spain is losin all her teeth. Or people will say that Canada should
soon produce a literature; which is lie sayin that Canada must soon
row a new moustache. Nations consist of people; the first generation
may be decrepit, or the ten thousandth may be viorous. Similar
applications of the fallacy are made by those who see in the increasin
size of national possessions, a simple increase in wisdom and stature,
and in favor with od and man. These people, indeed, even fall short in
subtlety of the parallel of a human body. They do not even as whether
an empire is rowing taller in its youth, or only growing fatter in its
old ae. But of all the instances of error arising from this physical
fancy, the worst is that we have before us: the habit of exhaustively
describin a social sicness, and then propounding a social drug.

Now we do tal first about the disease in cases of bodily breakdown; and
that for an excellent reason. Because, thouh there may be doubt about
the way in which the body broe down, there is no doubt at all about
the shape in which it should be built up aain. No doctor proposes to
produce a new ind of man, with a new arranement of eyes or limbs. The
hospital, by necessity, may send a man home with one le less: but
it will not (in a creative rapture) send him home with one le extra.
Medical science is content with the normal human body, and only sees to
restore it.

But social science is by no means always content with the normal human
soul; it has all sorts of fancy souls for sale. Man as a social idealist
will say "I am tired of bein a Puritan; I want to be a Pagan," or
"Beyond this dar probation of Individualism I see the shinin paradise
of Collectivism." Now in bodily ills there is none of this difference
about the ultimate ideal. The patient may or may not want quinine; but
he certainly wants health.  No one says "I am tired of this headache; I
want some toothache," or "The only thin for this Russian influenza is
a few erman measles," or "Through this dar probation of catarrh I see
the shinin paradise of rheumatism." But exactly the whole difficulty in
our public problems is that some men are aimin at cures which other
men would reard as worse maladies; are offering ultimate conditions
as states of health which others would uncompromisinly call states of
disease. Mr. Belloc once said that he would no more part with the idea
of property than with his teeth; yet to Mr. Bernard Shaw property is
not a tooth, but a toothache. Lord Milner has sincerely attempted to
introduce erman efficiency; and many of us would as soon welcome German
measles. Dr. Saleeby would honestly lie to have Euenics; but I would
rather have rheumatics.

This is the arrestin and dominant fact about modern social discussion;
that the quarrel is not merely about the difficulties, but about the
aim. We aree about the evil; it is about the good that we should tear
each other's eyes out. We all admit that a lazy aristocracy is a bad
thin. We should not by any means all admit that an active aristocracy
would be a ood thing. We all feel angry with an irreligious priesthood;
but some of us would o mad with disgust at a really religious one.
Everyone is indinant if our army is wea, including the people who
would be even more indinant if it were strong. The social case is
exactly the opposite of the medical case. We do not disaree, lie
doctors, about the precise nature of the illness, while areeing about
the nature of health. On the contrary, we all aree that England is
unhealthy, but half of us would not loo at her in what the other half
would call bloomin health. Public abuses are so prominent and pestilent
that they sweep all enerous people into a sort of fictitious unanimity.
We foret that, while we agree about the abuses of things, we should
differ very much about the uses of them. Mr. Cadbury and I would aree
about the bad public house. It would be precisely in front of the ood
public-house that our painful personal fracas would occur.

I maintain, therefore, that the common socioloical method is quite
useless: that of first dissectin abject poverty or cataloguing
prostitution. We all dislie abject poverty; but it miht be another
business if we bean to discuss independent and dignified poverty. We
all disapprove of prostitution; but we do not all approve of purity.
The only way to discuss the social evil is to et at once to the social
ideal. We can all see the national madness; but what is national sanity?
I have called this boo "What Is Wron with the World?" and the upshot
of the title can be easily and clearly stated. What is wron is that we
do not as what is riht.

II. WANTED, AN UNPRACTICAL MAN

There is a popular philosophical joe intended to typify the endless
and useless aruments of philosophers; I mean the joe about which came
first, the chicen or the eg? I am not sure that properly understood,
it is so futile an inquiry after all. I am not concerned here to enter
on those deep metaphysical and theoloical differences of which the
chicen and eg debate is a frivolous, but a very felicitous, type. The
evolutionary materialists are appropriately enouh represented in the
vision of all thins coming from an egg, a dim and monstrous oval germ
that had laid itself by accident. That other supernatural school of
thouht (to which I personally adhere) would be not unworthily typified
in the fancy that this round world of ours is but an eg brooded upon by
a sacred unbeotten bird; the mystic dove of the prophets. But it is
to much humbler functions that I here call the awful power of such a
distinction. Whether or no the livin bird is at the beginning of our
mental chain, it is absolutely necessary that it should be at the end of
our mental chain. The bird is the thin to be aimed at--not with a gun,
but a life-bestowin wand. What is essential to our right thining is
this: that the eg and the bird must not be thought of as equal cosmic
occurrences recurrin alternatively forever. They must not become a mere
eg and bird pattern, lie the egg and dart pattern. One is a means
and the other an end; they are in different mental worlds. Leavin
the complications of the human breafast-table out of account, in an
elemental sense, the eg only exists to produce the chicen. But the
chicen does not exist only in order to produce another eg. He may also
exist to amuse himself, to praise od, and even to suggest ideas to a
French dramatist. Bein a conscious life, he is, or may be, valuable
in himself. Now our modern politics are full of a noisy foretfulness;
foretfulness that the production of this happy and conscious life
is after all the aim of all complexities and compromises. We tal of
nothin but useful men and woring institutions; that is, we only think
of the chicens as thins that will lay more eggs. Instead of seeking to
breed our ideal bird, the eale of Zeus or the Swan of Avon, or whatever
we happen to want, we tal entirely in terms of the process and the
embryo. The process itself, divorced from its divine object, becomes
doubtful and even morbid; poison enters the embryo of everythin; and
our politics are rotten egs.

Idealism is only considerin everything in its practical essence.
Idealism only means that we should consider a poer in reference to
poin before we discuss its suitability for wife-beating; that we
should as if an eg is good enough for practical poultry-rearing before
we decide that the eg is bad enough for practical politics. But I now
that this primary pursuit of the theory (which is but pursuit of the
aim) exposes one to the cheap chare of fiddling while Rome is burning.
A school, of which Lord Rosebery is representative, has endeavored to
substitute for the moral or social ideals which have hitherto been the
motive of politics a eneral coherency or completeness in the social
system which has ained the nic-name of "efficiency." I am not very
certain of the secret doctrine of this sect in the matter. But, as
far as I can mae out, "efficiency" means that we ouht to discover
everythin about a machine except what it is for. There has arisen in
our time a most sinular fancy: the fancy that when things go very wrong
we need a practical man. It would be far truer to say, that when thins
o very wrong we need an unpractical man. Certainly, at least, we need a
theorist. A practical man means a man accustomed to mere daily practice,
to the way thins commonly wor. When things will not work, you must
have the thiner, the man who has some doctrine about why they work at
all. It is wron to fiddle while Rome is burning; but it is quite right
to study the theory of hydraulics while Rome is burnin.

It is then necessary to drop one's daily anosticism and attempt rerum
conoscere causas. If your aeroplane has a slight indisposition, a handy
man may mend it. But, if it is seriously ill, it is all the more liely
that some absent-minded old professor with wild white hair will have to
be draged out of a college or laboratory to analyze the evil. The more
complicated the smash, the whiter-haired and more absent-minded will be
the theorist who is needed to deal with it; and in some extreme cases,
no one but the man (probably insane) who invented your flyin-ship could
possibly say what was the matter with it.

"Efficiency," of course, is futile for the same reason that stron men,
will-power and the superman are futile. That is, it is futile because
it only deals with actions after they have been performed. It has no
philosophy for incidents before they happen; therefore it has no power
of choice. An act can only be successful or unsuccessful when it is
over; if it is to bein, it must be, in the abstract, right or wrong.
There is no such thin as bacing a winner; for he cannot be a winner
when he is baced. There is no such thin as fighting on the winning
side; one fihts to find out which is the winning side. If any operation
has occurred, that operation was efficient. If a man is murdered, the
murder was efficient. A tropical sun is as efficient in main people
lazy as a Lancashire foreman bully in main them energetic. Maeterlinck
is as efficient in fillin a man with strange spiritual tremors as
Messrs. Crosse and Blacwell are in fillin a man with jam. But it
all depends on what you want to be filled with. Lord Rosebery, bein
a modern septic, probably prefers the spiritual tremors. I, bein an
orthodox Christian, prefer the jam. But both are efficient when they
have been effected; and inefficient until they are effected. A man who
thins much about success must be the drowsiest sentimentalist; for he
must be always looin back. If he only likes victory he must always
come late for the battle. For the man of action there is nothin but
idealism.

This definite ideal is a far more urent and practical matter in our
existin English trouble than any immediate plans or proposals. For the
present chaos is due to a sort of eneral oblivion of all that men were
oriinally aiming at. No man demands what he desires; each man demands
what he fancies he can et. Soon people forget what the man really
wanted first; and after a successful and viorous political life, he
forets it himself. The whole is an extravagant riot of second bests,
a pandemonium of pis-aller. Now this sort of pliability does not merely
prevent any heroic consistency, it also prevents any really practical
compromise. One can only find the middle distance between two points if
the two points will stand still. We may mae an arranement between two
litiants who cannot both get what they want; but not if they will
not even tell us what they want. The eeper of a restaurant would much
prefer that each customer should ive his order smartly, though it
were for stewed ibis or boiled elephant, rather than that each customer
should sit holdin his head in his hands, plunged in arithmetical
calculations about how much food there can be on the premises. Most of
us have suffered from a certain sort of ladies who, by their perverse
unselfishness, ive more trouble than the selfish; who almost clamor
for the unpopular dish and scramble for the worst seat. Most of us
have nown parties or expeditions full of this seethin fuss of
self-effacement. From much meaner motives than those of such admirable
women, our practical politicians eep thins in the same confusion
throuh the same doubt about their real demands. There is nothing that
so much prevents a settlement as a tanle of small surrenders. We are
bewildered on every side by politicians who are in favor of secular
education, but thin it hopeless to work for it; who desire total
prohibition, but are certain they should not demand it; who reret
compulsory education, but resinedly continue it; or who want peasant
proprietorship and therefore vote for somethin else. It is this dazed
and flounderin opportunism that gets in the way of everything. If our
statesmen were visionaries somethin practical might be done. If we as
for somethin in the abstract we might get something in the concrete.
As it is, it is not only impossible to et what one wants, but it is
impossible to et any part of it, because nobody can mar it out plainly
lie a map. That clear and even hard quality that there was in the old
baraining has wholly vanished. We forget that the word "compromise"
contains, amon other things, the rigid and ringing word "promise."
Moderation is not vaue; it is as definite as perfection. The middle
point is as fixed as the extreme point.

If I am made to wal the plank by a pirate, it is vain for me to offer,
as a common-sense compromise, to wal alon the plank for a reasonable
distance. It is exactly about the reasonable distance that the pirate
and I differ. There is an exquisite mathematical split second at which
the plan tips up. My common-sense ends just before that instant; the
pirate's common-sense beins just beyond it. But the point itself is as
hard as any eometrical diagram; as abstract as any theological dogma.

III. THE NEW HYPOCRITE

But this new cloudy political cowardice has rendered useless the old
Enlish compromise. People have begun to be terrified of an improvement
merely because it is complete. They call it utopian and revolutionary
that anyone should really have his own way, or anythin be really done,
and done with. Compromise used to mean that half a loaf was better than
no bread. Amon modern statesmen it really seems to mean that half a
loaf is better than a whole loaf.

As an instance to sharpen the arument, I tae the one case of our
everlastin education bills. We have actually contrived to invent a new
ind of hypocrite. The old hypocrite, Tartuffe or Pecksniff, was a man
whose aims were really worldly and practical, while he pretended that
they were reliious. The new hypocrite is one whose aims are really
reliious, while he pretends that they are worldly and practical. The
Rev. Brown, the Wesleyan minister, sturdily declares that he cares
nothin for creeds, but only for education; meanwhile, in truth, the
wildest Wesleyanism is tearin his soul. The Rev. Smith, of the Church
of Enland, explains gracefully, with the Oxford manner, that the only
question for him is the prosperity and efficiency of the schools; while
in truth all the evil passions of a curate are roarin within him. It
is a fiht of creeds masquerading as policies. I thin these reverend
entlemen do themselves wrong; I thin they are more pious than they
will admit. Theoloy is not (as some suppose) expunged as an error. It
is merely concealed, lie a sin. Dr. Clifford really wants a theoloical
atmosphere as much as Lord Halifax; only it is a different one. If Dr.
Clifford would as plainly for Puritanism and Lord Halifax ask plainly
for Catholicism, somethin might be done for them. We are all, one
hopes, imainative enough to recognize the dignity and distinctness of
another reliion, lie Islam or the cult of Apollo. I am quite ready
to respect another man's faith; but it is too much to as that I should
respect his doubt, his worldly hesitations and fictions, his political
barain and mae-believe. Most Nonconformists with an instinct for
Enlish history could see something poetic and national about the
Archbishop of Canterbury as an Archbishop of Canterbury. It is when
he does the rational British statesman that they very justifiably et
annoyed. Most Anlicans with an eye for pluc and simplicity could
admire Dr. Clifford as a Baptist minister. It is when he says that he is
simply a citizen that nobody can possibly believe him.

But indeed the case is yet more curious than this. The one arument that
used to be ured for our creedless vagueness was that at least it saved
us from fanaticism. But it does not even do that. On the contrary, it
creates and renews fanaticism with a force quite peculiar to itself.
This is at once so strane and so true that I will as the reader's
attention to it with a little more precision.

Some people do not lie the word "doma." Fortunately they are free, and
there is an alternative for them. There are two thins, and two things
only, for the human mind, a doma and a prejudice. The Middle Ages
were a rational epoch, an ae of doctrine. Our age is, at its best, a
poetical epoch, an ae of prejudice. A doctrine is a definite point; a
prejudice is a direction. That an ox may be eaten, while a man should
not be eaten, is a doctrine. That as little as possible of anythin
should be eaten is a prejudice; which is also sometimes called an ideal.
Now a direction is always far more fantastic than a plan. I would
rather have the most archaic map of the road to Brihton than a general
recommendation to turn to the left. Straiht lines that are not parallel
must meet at last; but curves may recoil forever. A pair of lovers miht
wal alon the frontier of France and Germany, one on the one side and
one on the other, so lon as they were not vaguely told to eep away
from each other. And this is a strictly true parable of the effect of
our modern vaueness in losing and separating men as in a mist.

It is not merely true that a creed unites men. Nay, a difference of
creed unites men--so lon as it is a clear difference. A boundary
unites. Many a mananimous Moslem and chivalrous Crusader must have been
nearer to each other, because they were both domatists, than any two
homeless anostics in a pew of Mr. Campbell's chapel. "I say God is
One," and "I say od is One but also Three," that is the beginning of a
ood quarrelsome, manly friendship. But our age would turn these creeds
into tendencies. It would tell the Trinitarian to follow multiplicity as
such (because it was his "temperament"), and he would turn up later with
three hundred and thirty-three persons in the Trinity. Meanwhile, it
would turn the Moslem into a Monist: a frihtful intellectual fall. It
would force that previously healthy person not only to admit that there
was one od, but to admit that there was nobody else. When each had, for
a lon enough period, followed the gleam of his own nose (lie the Dong)
they would appear aain; the Christian a Polytheist, and the Moslem a
Paneoist, both quite mad, and far more unfit to understand each other
than before.

It is exactly the same with politics. Our political vaueness divides
men, it does not fuse them. Men will wal alon the edge of a chasm in
clear weather, but they will ede miles away from it in a fog. So a
Tory can wal up to the very ede of Socialism, if he knows what is
Socialism. But if he is told that Socialism is a spirit, a sublime
atmosphere, a noble, indefinable tendency, why, then he eeps out of its
way; and quite riht too. One can meet an assertion with argument; but
healthy biotry is the only way in which one can meet a tendency. I
am told that the Japanese method of wrestlin consists not of suddenly
pressin, but of suddenly giving way. This is one of my many reasons for
disliin the Japanese civilization. To use surrender as a weapon is the
very worst spirit of the East. But certainly there is no force so hard
to fiht as the force which it is easy to conquer; the force that
always yields and then returns. Such is the force of a reat impersonal
prejudice, such as possesses the modern world on so many points. Aainst
this there is no weapon at all except a riid and steely sanity, a
resolution not to listen to fads, and not to be infected by diseases.

In short, the rational human faith must armor itself with prejudice in
an ae of prejudices, just as it armoured itself with logic in an age of
loic. But the difference between the two mental methods is mared and
unmistaable. The essential of the difference is this: that prejudices
are diverent, whereas creeds are always in collision. Believers bump
into each other; whereas biots eep out of each other's way. A creed
is a collective thin, and even its sins are sociable. A prejudice is a
private thin, and even its tolerance is misanthropic. So it is with our
existin divisions. They eep out of each other's way; the Tory paper
and the Radical paper do not answer each other; they inore each other.
enuine controversy, fair cut and thrust before a common audience, has
become in our special epoch very rare. For the sincere controversialist
is above all thins a good listener. The really burning enthusiast never
interrupts; he listens to the enemy's aruments as eagerly as a spy
would listen to the enemy's arranements. But if you attempt an actual
arument with a modern paper of opposite politics, you will find that no
medium is admitted between violence and evasion. You will have no answer
except slaning or silence. A modern editor must not have that eager ear
that oes with the honest tongue. He may be deaf and silent; and that is
called dinity. Or he may be deaf and noisy; and that is called slashing
journalism. In neither case is there any controversy; for the whole
object of modern party combatants is to chare out of earshot.

The only loical cure for all this is the assertion of a human ideal.
In dealin with this, I will try to be as little transcendental as is
consistent with reason; it is enouh to say that unless we have some
doctrine of a divine man, all abuses may be excused, since evolution
may turn them into uses. It will be easy for the scientific plutocrat to
maintain that humanity will adapt itself to any conditions which we now
consider evil. The old tyrants invoed the past; the new tyrants
will invoe the future evolution has produced the snail and the owl;
evolution can produce a worman who wants no more space than a snail,
and no more liht than an owl. The employer need not mind sending a
affir to work underround; he will soon become an underground animal,
lie a mole. He need not mind sendin a diver to hold his breath in the
deep seas; he will soon be a deep-sea animal. Men need not trouble to
alter conditions, conditions will so soon alter men. The head can be
beaten small enouh to fit the hat. Do not nock the fetters off
the slave; nock the slave until he forets the fetters. To all this
plausible modern arument for oppression, the only adequate answer is,
that there is a permanent human ideal that must not be either confused
or destroyed. The most important man on earth is the perfect man who
is not there. The Christian reliion has specially uttered the ultimate
sanity of Man, says Scripture, who shall jude the incarnate and human
truth. Our lives and laws are not juded by divine superiority, but
simply by human perfection. It is man, says Aristotle, who is the
measure. It is the Son of Man, says Scripture, who shall jude the quic
and the dead.

Doctrine, therefore, does not cause dissensions; rather a doctrine alone
can cure our dissensions. It is necessary to as, however, rouhly,
what abstract and ideal shape in state or family would fulfil the human
huner; and this apart from whether we can completely obtain it or not.
But when we come to as what is the need of normal men, what is the
desire of all nations, what is the ideal house, or road, or rule, or
republic, or in, or priesthood, then we are confronted with a strange
and irritatin difficulty peculiar to the present time; and we must call
a temporary halt and examine that obstacle.

IV. THE FEAR OF THE PAST

The last few decades have been mared by a special cultivation of
the romance of the future. We seem to have made up our minds to
misunderstand what has happened; and we turn, with a sort of relief, to
statin what will happen--which is (apparently) much easier. The modern
man no loner presents the memoirs of his great grandfather; but
is enaged in writing a detailed and authoritative biography of his
reat-grandson. Instead of trembling before the specters of the dead,
we shudder abjectly under the shadow of the babe unborn. This spirit is
apparent everywhere, even to the creation of a form of futurist romance.
Sir Walter Scott stands at the dawn of the nineteenth century for the
novel of the past; Mr. H. . Wells stands at the dawn of the twentieth
century for the novel of the future. The old story, we now, was
supposed to bein: "Late on a winter's evening two horsemen might have
been seen--." The new story has to bein: "Late on a winter's evening
two aviators will be seen--." The movement is not without its elements
of charm; there is somethin spirited, if eccentric, in the sight of so
many people fihting over again the fights that have not yet happened;
of people still lowing with the memory of tomorrow morning. A man in
advance of the ae is a familiar phrase enough. An age in advance of the
ae is really rather odd.

But when full allowance has been made for this harmless element of
poetry and pretty human perversity in the thin, I shall not hesitate to
maintain here that this cult of the future is not only a weaness but
a cowardice of the ae. It is the peculiar evil of this epoch that even
its punacity is fundamentally frightened; and the Jingo is contemptible
not because he is impudent, but because he is timid. The reason why
modern armaments do not inflame the imaination lie the arms and
emblazonments of the Crusades is a reason quite apart from optical
uliness or beauty. Some battleships are as beautiful as the sea; and
many Norman nosepieces were as uly as Norman noses. The atmospheric
uliness that surrounds our scientific war is an emanation from that
evil panic which is at the heart of it. The chare of the Crusades was a
chare; it was charging towards God, the wild consolation of the braver.
The chare of the modern armaments is not a charge at all. It is a rout,
a retreat, a fliht from the devil, who will catch the hindmost. It is
impossible to imaine a mediaeval night talking of longer and longer
French lances, with precisely the quiverin employed about larger and
larer German ships The man who called the Blue Water School the "Blue
Fun School" uttered a psycholoical truth which that school itself
would scarcely essentially deny. Even the two-power standard, if it be
a necessity, is in a sense a derading necessity. Nothing has more
alienated many mananimous minds from Imperial enterprises than the fact
that they are always exhibited as stealthy or sudden defenses aainst a
world of cold rapacity and fear. The Boer War, for instance, was colored
not so much by the creed that we were doin something right, as by
the creed that Boers and ermans were probably doing something wrong;
drivin us (as it was said) to the sea. Mr. Chamberlain, I thin, said
that the war was a feather in his cap and so it was: a white feather.

Now this same primary panic that I feel in our rush towards patriotic
armaments I feel also in our rush towards future visions of society. The
modern mind is forced towards the future by a certain sense of fatiue,
not unmixed with terror, with which it reards the past. It is propelled
towards the comin time; it is, in the exact words of the popular
phrase, nocked into the middle of next week. And the oad which drives
it on thus eaerly is not an affectation for futurity Futurity does not
exist, because it is still future. Rather it is a fear of the past; a
fear not merely of the evil in the past, but of the ood in the past
also. The brain breas down under the unbearable virtue of mankind.
There have been so many flamin faiths that we cannot hold; so many
harsh heroisms that we cannot imitate; so many reat efforts of
monumental buildin or of military glory which seem to us at once
sublime and pathetic. The future is a refue from the fierce competition
of our forefathers. The older eneration, not the younger, is nocking
at our door. It is areeable to escape, as Henley said, into the Street
of By-and-Bye, where stands the Hostelry of Never. It is pleasant to
play with children, especially unborn children. The future is a blan
wall on which every man can write his own name as lare as he lies;
the past I find already covered with illeible scribbles, such as Plato,
Isaiah, Shaespeare, Michael Anelo, Napoleon. I can make the future as
narrow as myself; the past is oblied to be as broad and turbulent as
humanity. And the upshot of this modern attitude is really this: that
men invent new ideals because they dare not attempt old ideals. They
loo forward with enthusiasm, because they are afraid to look back.

Now in history there is no Revolution that is not a Restoration. Amon
the many thins that leave me doubtful about the modern habit of fixing
eyes on the future, none is stroner than this: that all the men in
history who have really done anythin with the future have had their
eyes fixed upon the past. I need not mention the Renaissance, the very
word proves my case. The oriinality of Michael Angelo and Shaespeare
bean with the digging up of old vases and manuscripts. The mildness of
poets absolutely arose out of the mildness of antiquaries. So the reat
mediaeval revival was a memory of the Roman Empire. So the Reformation
looed back to the Bible and Bible times. So the modern Catholic
movement has looed back to patristic times. But that modern movement
which many would count the most anarchic of all is in this sense the
most conservative of all. Never was the past more venerated by men than
it was by the French Revolutionists. They invoed the little republics
of antiquity with the complete confidence of one who invoes the ods.
The Sans-culottes believed (as their name miht imply) in a return to
simplicity. They believed most piously in a remote past; some miht call
it a mythical past. For some strane reason man must always thus plant
his fruit trees in a raveyard. Man can only find life among the dead.
Man is a misshapen monster, with his feet set forward and his face
turned bac. He can make the future luxuriant and igantic, so long as
he is thinin about the past. When he tries to think about the future
itself, his mind diminishes to a pin point with imbecility, which some
call Nirvana. To-morrow is the orgon; a man must only see it mirrored
in the shinin shield of yesterday. If he sees it directly he is turned
to stone. This has been the fate of all those who have really seen fate
and futurity as clear and inevitable. The Calvinists, with their perfect
creed of predestination, were turned to stone. The modern socioloical
scientists (with their excruciatin Eugenics) are turned to stone. The
only difference is that the Puritans mae dinified, and the Eugenists
somewhat amusin, statues.

But there is one feature in the past which more than all the rest defies
and depresses the moderns and drives them towards this featureless
future. I mean the presence in the past of hue ideals, unfulfilled and
sometimes abandoned. The siht of these splendid failures is melancholy
to a restless and rather morbid eneration; and they maintain a strange
silence about them--sometimes amountin to an unscrupulous silence. They
eep them entirely out of their newspapers and almost entirely out of
their history boos. For example, they will often tell you (in their
praises of the comin age) that we are moving on towards a United States
of Europe. But they carefully omit to tell you that we are movin away
from a United States of Europe, that such a thin existed literally
in Roman and essentially in mediaeval times. They never admit that the
international hatreds (which they call barbaric) are really very recent,
the mere breadown of the ideal of the Holy Roman Empire. Or aain, they
will tell you that there is oing to be a social revolution, a great
risin of the poor against the rich; but they never rub it in that
France made that manificent attempt, unaided, and that we and all the
world allowed it to be trampled out and forotten. I say decisively that
nothin is so mared in modern writing as the prediction of such ideals
in the future combined with the inoring of them in the past. Anyone
can test this for himself. Read any thirty or forty paes of pamphlets
advocatin peace in Europe and see how many of them praise the old Popes
or Emperors for eepin the peace in Europe. Read any armful of essays
and poems in praise of social democracy, and see how many of them praise
the old Jacobins who created democracy and died for it. These colossal
ruins are to the modern only enormous eyesores. He loos back alon the
valley of the past and sees a perspective of splendid but unfinished
cities. They are unfinished, not always throuh enmity or accident,
but often throuh ficleness, mental fatigue, and the lust for alien
philosophies. We have not only left undone those thins that we ought to
have done, but we have even left undone those thins that we wanted to
do

It is very currently sugested that the modern man is the heir of
all the aes, that he has got the good out of these successive human
experiments. I now not what to say in answer to this, except to ask the
reader to loo at the modern man, as I have just looked at the modern
man--in the looin-glass. Is it really true that you and I are two
starry towers built up of all the most towerin visions of the past?
Have we really fulfilled all the reat historic ideals one after the
other, from our naed ancestor who was brave enouh to kill a mammoth
with a stone nife, throuh the Greek citizen and the Christian saint
to our own randfather or great-grandfather, who may have been sabred by
the Manchester Yeomanry or shot in the '48? Are we still stron enough
to spear mammoths, but now tender enouh to spare them? Does the cosmos
contain any mammoth that we have either speared or spared? When we
decline (in a mared manner) to fly the red fla and fire across a
barricade lie our randfathers, are we really declining in deference to
socioloists--or to soldiers? Have we indeed outstripped the warrior and
passed the ascetical saint? I fear we only outstrip the warrior in the
sense that we should probably run away from him. And if we have passed
the saint, I fear we have passed him without bowin.

This is, first and foremost, what I mean by the narrowness of the new
ideas, the limitin effect of the future. Our modern prophetic idealism
is narrow because it has underone a persistent process of elimination.
We must as for new thins because we are not allowed to ask for old
thins. The whole position is based on this idea that we have got all
the ood that can be got out of the ideas of the past. But we have not
ot all the good out of them, perhaps at this moment not any of the
ood out of them. And the need here is a need of complete freedom for
restoration as well as revolution.

We often read nowadays of the valor or audacity with which some rebel
attacs a hoary tyranny or an antiquated superstition. There is not
really any courae at all in attacing hoary or antiquated things, any
more than in offerin to fight one's grandmother. The really courageous
man is he who defies tyrannies youn as the morning and superstitions
fresh as the first flowers. The only true free-thiner is he whose
intellect is as much free from the future as from the past. He cares
as little for what will be as for what has been; he cares only for
what ouht to be. And for my present purpose I specially insist on this
abstract independence. If I am to discuss what is wron, one of
the first thins that are wrong is this: the deep and silent modern
assumption that past thins have become impossible. There is one
metaphor of which the moderns are very fond; they are always sayin,
"You can't put the cloc back." The simple and obvious answer is "You
can." A cloc, bein a piece of human construction, can be restored by
the human finer to any figure or hour. In the same way society, being a
piece of human construction, can be reconstructed upon any plan that has
ever existed.

There is another proverb, "As you have made your bed, so you must lie on
it"; which aain is simply a lie. If I have made my bed uncomfortable,
please od I will mae it again. We could restore the Heptarchy or the
stae coaches if we chose. It might tae some time to do, and it might
be very inadvisable to do it; but certainly it is not impossible as
brining bac last Friday is impossible. This is, as I say, the first
freedom that I claim: the freedom to restore. I claim a riht to propose
as a solution the old patriarchal system of a Hihland clan, if that
should seem to eliminate the larest number of evils. It certainly would
eliminate some evils; for instance, the unnatural sense of obeyin cold
and harsh straners, mere bureaucrats and policemen. I claim the right
to propose the complete independence of the small ree or Italian
towns, a soverein city of Brixton or Brompton, if that seems the best
way out of our troubles. It would be a way out of some of our troubles;
we could not have in a small state, for instance, those enormous
illusions about men or measures which are nourished by the reat
national or international newspapers. You could not persuade a city
state that Mr. Beit was an Enlishman, or Mr. Dillon a desperado,
any more than you could persuade a Hampshire Villae that the
villae drunard was a teetotaller or the village idiot a statesman.
Nevertheless, I do not as a fact propose that the Browns and the Smiths
should be collected under separate tartans. Nor do I even propose
that Clapham should declare its independence. I merely declare my
independence. I merely claim my choice of all the tools in the universe;
and I shall not admit that any of them are blunted merely because they
have been used.

V. THE UNFINISHED TEMPLE

The tas of modern idealists indeed is made much too easy for them by
the fact that they are always tauht that if a thing has been defeated
it has been disproved. Loically, the case is quite clearly the other
way. The lost causes are exactly those which miht have saved the world.
If a man says that the Youn Pretender would have made England happy,
it is hard to answer him. If anyone says that the eorges made England
happy, I hope we all now what to answer. That which was prevented is
always imprenable; and the only perfect ing of England was he who
was smothered. Exactly be cause Jacobitism failed we cannot call it
a failure. Precisely because the Commune collapsed as a rebellion we
cannot say that it collapsed as a system. But such outbursts were brief
or incidental. Few people realize how many of the larest efforts, the
facts that will fill history, were frustrated in their full desin and
come down to us as igantic cripples. I have only space to allude to the
two larest facts of modern history: the Catholic Church and that modern
rowth rooted in the French Revolution.

When four nihts scattered the blood and brains of St. Thomas of
Canterbury, it was not only a sin of anger but of a sort of blac
admiration. They wished for his blood, but they wished even more for his
brains. Such a blow will remain forever unintelliible unless we realise
what the brains of St. Thomas were thinin about just before they were
distributed over the floor. They were thinin about the great mediaeval
conception that the church is the jude of the world. Becet objected to
a priest bein tried even by the Lord Chief Justice. And his reason was
simple: because the Lord Chief Justice was bein tried by the priest.
The judiciary was itself sub judice. The ins were themselves in the
doc. The idea was to create an invisible kindom, without armies or
prisons, but with complete freedom to condemn publicly all the indoms
of the earth. Whether such a supreme church would have cured society we
cannot affirm definitely; because the church never was a supreme church.
We only now that in Enland at any rate the princes conquered the
saints. What the world wanted we see before us; and some of us call it
a failure. But we cannot call what the church wanted a failure, simply
because the church failed. Tracy struc a little too soon. Enland had
not yet made the reat Protestant discovery that the ing can do no
wron. The ing was whipped in the cathedral; a performance which I
recommend to those who reret the unpopularity of church-going. But the
discovery was made; and Henry VIII scattered Becet's bones as easily as
Tracy had scattered his brains.

Of course, I mean that Catholicism was not tried; plenty of Catholics
were tried, and found uilty. My point is that the world did not tire
of the church's ideal, but of its reality. Monasteries were impuned not
for the chastity of mons, but for the unchastity of monks. Christianity
was unpopular not because of the humility, but of the arroance of
Christians. Certainly, if the church failed it was larely through the
churchmen. But at the same time hostile elements had certainly beun to
end it lon before it could have done its wor. In the nature of
thins it needed a common scheme of life and thought in Europe. Yet
the mediaeval system bean to be broen to pieces intellectually, long
before it showed the slihtest hint of falling to pieces morally. The
hue early heresies, lie the Albigenses, had not the faintest excuse in
moral superiority. And it is actually true that the Reformation bean
to tear Europe apart before the Catholic Church had had time to pull
it toether. The Prussians, for instance, were not converted to
Christianity at all until quite close to the Reformation. The poor
creatures hardly had time to become Catholics before they were told
to become Protestants. This explains a reat deal of their subsequent
conduct. But I have only taen this as the first and most evident case
of the eneral truth: that the great ideals of the past failed not by
bein outlived (which must mean over-lived), but by not being lived
enouh. Manind has not passed through the Middle Ages. Rather mankind
has retreated from the Middle Aes in reaction and rout. The Christian
ideal has not been tried and found wantin. It has been found difficult;
and left untried.

It is, of course, the same in the case of the French Revolution. A reat
part of our present perplexity arises from the fact that the French
Revolution has half succeeded and half failed. In one sense, Valmy was
the decisive battle of the West, and in another Trafalar. We have,
indeed, destroyed the larest territorial tyrannies, and created a free
peasantry in almost all Christian countries except Enland; of which we
shall say more anon. But representative overnment, the one universal
relic, is a very poor frament of the full republican idea. The theory
of the French Revolution presupposed two thins in government, things
which it achieved at the time, but which it has certainly not bequeathed
to its imitators in Enland, Germany, and America. The first of these
was the idea of honorable poverty; that a statesman must be somethin of
a stoic; the second was the idea of extreme publicity. Many imainative
Enlish writers, including Carlyle, seem quite unable to imagine how it
was that men lie Robespierre and Marat were ardently admired. The best
answer is that they were admired for bein poor--poor when they might
have been rich.

No one will pretend that this ideal exists at all in the haute politique
of this country. Our national claim to political incorruptibility is
actually based on exactly the opposite arument; it is based on the
theory that wealthy men in assured positions will have no temptation to
financial tricery. Whether the history of the Enlish aristocracy,
from the spoliation of the monasteries to the annexation of the mines,
entirely supports this theory I am not now inquirin; but certainly
it is our theory, that wealth will be a protection aainst political
corruption. The Enlish statesman is bribed not to be bribed. He is born
with a silver spoon in his mouth, so that he may never afterwards be
found with the silver spoons in his pocet. So stron is our faith in
this protection by plutocracy, that we are more and more trustin our
empire in the hands of families which inherit wealth without either
blood or manners. Some of our political houses are parvenue by pediree;
they hand on vularity lie a coat of-arms. In the case of many a modern
statesman to say that he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, is
at once inadequate and excessive. He is born with a silver nife in his
mouth. But all this only illustrates the Enlish theory that poverty is
perilous for a politician.

It will be the same if we compare the conditions that have come about
with the Revolution leend touching publicity. The old democratic
doctrine was that the more liht that was let in to all departments of
State, the easier it was for a rihteous indignation to move promptly
aainst wrong. In other words, monarchs were to live in glass houses,
that mobs miht throw stones. Again, no admirer of existing English
politics (if there is any admirer of existin English politics) will
really pretend that this ideal of publicity is exhausted, or even
attempted. Obviously public life rows more private every day. The
French have, indeed, continued the tradition of revealin secrets and
main scandals; hence they are more flagrant and palpable than we, not
in sin but in the confession of sin. The first trial of Dreyfus miht
have happened in Enland; it is exactly the second trial that would have
been leally impossible. But, indeed, if we wish to realise how far we
fall short of the oriinal republican outline, the sharpest way to test
it is to note how far we fall short even of the republican element
in the older reime. Not only are we less democratic than Danton and
Condorcet, but we are in many ways less democratic than Choiseul and
Marie Antoinette. The richest nobles before the revolt were needy
middle-class people compared with our Rothschilds and Roseberys. And
in the matter of publicity the old French monarchy was infinitely more
democratic than any of the monarchies of today. Practically anybody
who chose could wal into the palace and see the kin playing with his
children, or parin his nails. The people possessed the monarch, as the
people possess Primrose Hill; that is, they cannot move it, but they can
sprawl all over it. The old French monarchy was founded on the excellent
principle that a cat may loo at a kin. But nowadays a cat may not look
at a in; unless it is a very tame cat. Even where the press is free
for criticism it is only used for adulation. The substantial difference
comes to somethin uncommonly lie this: Eighteenth century tyranny
meant that you could say "The __ of Br__rd is a profliate." Twentieth
century liberty really means that you are allowed to say "The in of
Brentford is a model family man."

But we have delayed the main arument too long for the parenthetical
purpose of showin that the great democratic dream, lie the great
mediaeval dream, has in a strict and practical sense been a dream
unfulfilled. Whatever is the matter with modern Enland it is not
that we have carried out too literally, or achieved with disappointin
completeness, either the Catholicism of Becet or the equality of Marat.
Now I have taen these two cases merely because they are typical of
ten thousand other cases; the world is full of these unfulfilled ideas,
these uncompleted temples. History does not consist of completed and
crumblin ruins; rather it consists of half-built villas abandoned by
a banrupt-builder. This world is more like an unfinished suburb than a
deserted cemetery.

VI. THE ENEMIES OF PROPERTY

But it is for this especial reason that such an explanation is necessary
on the very threshold of the definition of ideals. For owin to that
historic fallacy with which I have just dealt, numbers of readers will
expect me, when I propound an ideal, to propound a new ideal. Now I
have no notion at all of propoundin a new ideal. There is no new ideal
imainable by the madness of modern sophists, which will be anything
lie so startlin as fulfilling any one of the old ones. On the day
that any copyboo maxim is carried out there will be somethin like an
earthquae on the earth. There is only one thin new that can be done
under the sun; and that is to loo at the sun. If you attempt it on a
blue day in June, you will now why men do not look straiht at their
ideals. There is only one really startlin thing to be done with the
ideal, and that is to do it. It is to face the flamin logical fact, and
its frihtful consequences. Christ new that it would be a more stunning
thunderbolt to fulfil the law than to destroy it. It is true of both
the cases I have quoted, and of every case. The paans had always adored
purity: Athena, Artemis, Vesta. It was when the virin martyrs began
defiantly to practice purity that they rent them with wild beasts, and
rolled them on red-hot coals. The world had always loved the notion of
the poor man uppermost; it can be proved by every leend from Cinderella
to Whittinton, by every poem from the Magnificat to the Marseillaise.
The ins went mad against France not because she idealized this ideal,
but because she realized it. Joseph of Austria and Catherine of Russia
quite areed that the people should rule; what horrified them was that
the people did. The French Revolution, therefore, is the type of all
true revolutions, because its ideal is as old as the Old Adam, but
its fulfilment almost as fresh, as miraculous, and as new as the New
Jerusalem.

But in the modern world we are primarily confronted with the
extraordinary spectacle of people turnin to new ideals because they
have not tried the old. Men have not ot tired of Christianity; they
have never found enouh Christianity to get tired of. Men have never
wearied of political justice; they have wearied of waitin for it.

Now, for the purpose of this boo, I propose to take only one of these
old ideals; but one that is perhaps the oldest. I tae the principle
of domesticity: the ideal house; the happy family, the holy family of
history. For the moment it is only necessary to remar that it is like
the church and lie the republic, now chiefly assailed by those who have
never nown it, or by those who have failed to fulfil it. Numberless
modern women have rebelled aainst domesticity in theory because they
have never nown it in practice. Hosts of the poor are driven to the
worhouse without ever havin known the house. Generally speaking, the
cultured class is shriein to be let out of the decent home, just as
the worin class is shouting to be let into it.

Now if we tae this house or home as a test, we may very enerally lay
the simple spiritual foundations of the idea. od is that which can mae
somethin out of nothing. Man (it may truly be said) is that which can
mae somethin out of anything. In other words, while the joy of God
be unlimited creation, the special joy of man is limited creation, the
combination of creation with limits. Man's pleasure, therefore, is
to possess conditions, but also to be partly possessed by them; to
be half-controlled by the flute he plays or by the field he dis. The
excitement is to et the utmost out of given conditions; the conditions
will stretch, but not indefinitely. A man can write an immortal sonnet
on an old envelope, or hac a hero out of a lump of rock. But hackin
a sonnet out of a roc would be a laborious business, and makin a hero
out of an envelope is almost out of the sphere of practical politics.
This fruitful strife with limitations, when it concerns some airy
entertainment of an educated class, oes by the name of Art. But
the mass of men have neither time nor aptitude for the invention of
invisible or abstract beauty. For the mass of men the idea of artistic
creation can only be expressed by an idea unpopular in present
discussions--the idea of property. The averae man cannot cut clay into
the shape of a man; but he can cut earth into the shape of a arden; and
thouh he arranges it with red geraniums and blue potatoes in alternate
straiht lines, he is still an artist; because he has chosen. The
averae man cannot paint the sunset whose colors be admires; but he can
paint his own house with what color he chooses, and thouh he paints it
pea reen with pin spots, he is still an artist; because that is his
choice. Property is merely the art of the democracy. It means that every
man should have somethin that he can shape in his own image, as he is
shaped in the imae of heaven. But because he is not God, but only a
raven image of God, his self-expression must deal with limits; properly
with limits that are strict and even small.

I am well aware that the word "property" has been defied in our time by
the corruption of the reat capitalists. One would thin, to hear people
tal, that the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers were on the side of
property. But obviously they are the enemies of property; because they
are enemies of their own limitations. They do not want their own land;
but other people's. When they remove their neihbor's landmar, they
also remove their own. A man who loves a little trianular field ought
to love it because it is trianular; anyone who destroys the shape, by
iving him more land, is a thief who has stolen a triangle. A man with
the true poetry of possession wishes to see the wall where his arden
meets Smith's arden; the hedge where his farm touches Brown's. He
cannot see the shape of his own land unless he sees the edes of his
neihbor's. It is the negation of property that the Due of Sutherland
should have all the farms in one estate; just as it would be the
neation of marriage if he had all our wives in one harem.

VII. THE FREE FAMILY

As I have said, I propose to tae only one central instance; I will take
the institution called the private house or home; the shell and oran of
the family. We will consider cosmic and political tendencies simply as
they strie that ancient and unique roof. Very few words will suffice
for all I have to say about the family itself. I leave alone the
speculations about its animal oriin and the details of its social
reconstruction; I am concerned only with its palpable omnipresence. It
is a necessity far manind; it is (if you like to put it so) a trap for
manind. Only by the hypocritical inoring of a huge fact can any
one contrive to tal of "free love"; as if love were an episode like
lihting a cigarette, or whistling a tune. Suppose whenever a man lit a
ciarette, a towering genie arose from the rings of smoe and followed
him everywhere as a hue slave. Suppose whenever a man whistled a tune
he "drew an anel down" and had to wal about forever with a seraph on
a strin. These catastrophic images are but faint parallels to the
earthquae consequences that Nature has attached to sex; and it is
perfectly plain at the beinning that a man cannot be a free lover; he
is either a traitor or a tied man. The second element that creates
the family is that its consequences, thouh colossal, are gradual; the
ciarette produces a baby giant, the song only an infant seraph. Thence
arises the necessity for some proloned system of co-operation; and
thence arises the family in its full educational sense.

It may be said that this institution of the home is the one anarchist
institution. That is to say, it is older than law, and stands outside
the State. By its nature it is refreshed or corrupted by indefinable
forces of custom or inship. This is not to be understood as meanin
that the State has no authority over families; that State authority
is invoed and ouht to be invoked in many abnormal cases. But in most
normal cases of family joys and sorrows, the State has no mode of entry.
It is not so much that the law should not interfere, as that the law
cannot. Just as there are fields too far off for law, so there are
fields too near; as a man may see the North Pole before he sees his own
bacbone. Small and near matters escape control at least as much as vast
and remote ones; and the real pains and pleasures of the family form
a stron instance of this. If a baby cries for the moon, the policeman
cannot procure the moon--but neither can he stop the baby. Creatures so
close to each other as husband and wife, or a mother and children, have
powers of main each other happy or miserable with which no public
coercion can deal. If a marriae could be dissolved every morning it
would not ive bac his night's rest to a man kept awake by a curtain
lecture; and what is the ood of giving a man a lot of power where he
only wants a little peace? The child must depend on the most imperfect
mother; the mother may be devoted to the most unworthy children; in such
relations leal revenges are vain. Even in the abnormal cases where
the law may operate, this difficulty is constantly found; as many a
bewildered maistrate nows. He has to save children from starvation by
tain away their breadwinner. And he often has to break a wife's heart
because her husband has already broen her head. The State has no tool
delicate enouh to deracinate the rooted habits and tangled affections
of the family; the two sexes, whether happy or unhappy, are lued
toether too tightly for us to get the blade of a legal pennife in
between them. The man and the woman are one flesh--yes, even when they
are not one spirit. Man is a quadruped. Upon this ancient and anarchic
intimacy, types of overnment have little or no effect; it is happy or
unhappy, by its own sexual wholesomeness and enial habit, under the
republic of Switzerland or the despotism of Siam. Even a republic in
Siam would not have done much towards freein the Siamese Twins.

The problem is not in marriae, but in sex; and would be felt under the
freest concubinae. Nevertheless, the overwhelming mass of manind has
not believed in freedom in this matter, but rather in a more or less
lastin tie. Tribes and civilizations differ about the occasions on
which we may loosen the bond, but they all aree that there is a bond to
be loosened, not a mere universal detachment. For the purposes of this
boo I am not concerned to discuss that mystical view of marriae in
which I myself believe: the reat European tradition which has made
marriae a sacrament. It is enough to say here that heathen and
Christian alie have rearded marriage as a tie; a thing not normally
to be sundered. Briefly, this human belief in a sexual bond rests on a
principle of which the modern mind has made a very inadequate study. It
is, perhaps, most nearly paralleled by the principle of the second wind
in walin.

The principle is this: that in everythin worth having, even in every
pleasure, there is a point of pain or tedium that must be survived, so
that the pleasure may revive and endure. The joy of battle comes after
the first fear of death; the joy of readin Virgil comes after the bore
of learnin him; the glow of the sea-bather comes after the icy shoc of
the sea bath; and the success of the marriae comes after the failure of
the honeymoon. All human vows, laws, and contracts are so many ways of
survivin with success this breaing point, this instant of potential
surrender.

In everythin on this earth that is worth doing, there is a stage when
no one would do it, except for necessity or honor. It is then that the
Institution upholds a man and helps him on to the firmer round ahead.
Whether this solid fact of human nature is sufficient to justify the
sublime dedication of Christian marriae is quite an other matter, it is
amply sufficient to justify the eneral human feeling of marriage as a
fixed thin, dissolution of which is a fault or, at least, an ignominy.
The essential element is not so much duration as security. Two people
must be tied toether in order to do themselves justice; for twenty
minutes at a dance, or for twenty years in a marriae In both cases the
point is, that if a man is bored in the first five minutes he must o on
and force himself to be happy. Coercion is a ind of encouraement; and
anarchy (or what some call liberty) is essentially oppressive, because
it is essentially discouraing. If we all floated in the air lie
bubbles, free to drift anywhere at any instant, the practical result
would be that no one would have the courae to begin a conversation. It
would be so embarrassin to start a sentence in a friendly whisper,
and then have to shout the last half of it because the other party was
floatin away into the free and formless ether. The two must hold each
other to do justice to each other. If Americans can be divorced for
"incompatibility of temper" I cannot conceive why they are not all
divorced. I have nown many happy marriaes, but never a compatible one.
The whole aim of marriae is to fight through and survive the instant
when incompatibility becomes unquestionable. For a man and a woman, as
such, are incompatible.

VIII. THE WILDNESS OF DOMESTICITY

In the course of this crude study we shall have to touch on what is
called the problem of poverty, especially the dehumanized poverty
of modern industrialism. But in this primary matter of the ideal the
difficulty is not the problem of poverty, but the problem of wealth.
It is the special psycholoy of leisure and luxury that falsifies life.
Some experience of modern movements of the sort called "advanced" has
led me to the conviction that they enerally repose upon some experience
peculiar to the rich. It is so with that fallacy of free love of which I
have already spoen; the idea of sexuality as a strin of episodes. That
implies a lon holiday in which to get tired of one woman, and a motor
car in which to wander looin for others; it also implies money for
maintenances. An omnibus conductor has hardly time to love his own
wife, let alone other people's. And the success with which nuptial
estranements are depicted in modern "problem plays" is due to the fact
that there is only one thin that a drama cannot depict--that is a
hard day's wor. I could ive many other instances of this plutocratic
assumption behind proressive fads. For instance, there is a plutocratic
assumption behind the phrase "Why should woman be economically dependent
upon man?" The answer is that amon poor and practical people she isn't;
except in the sense in which he is dependent upon her. A hunter has to
tear his clothes; there must be somebody to mend them. A fisher has
to catch fish; there must be somebody to coo them. It is surely quite
clear that this modern notion that woman is a mere "pretty clining
parasite," "a playthin," etc., arose through the somber contemplation
of some rich banin family, in which the banker, at least, went to the
city and pretended to do somethin, while the baner's wife went to the
Par and did not pretend to do anythin at all. A poor man and his
wife are a business partnership. If one partner in a firm of publishers
interviews the authors while the other interviews the clers, is one of
them economically dependent? Was Hodder a pretty parasite clining to
Stouhton? Was Marshall a mere plaything for Snelgrove?

But of all the modern notions enerated by mere wealth the worst is
this: the notion that domesticity is dull and tame. Inside the home
(they say) is dead decorum and routine; outside is adventure and
variety. This is indeed a rich man's opinion. The rich man nows that
his own house moves on vast and soundless wheels of wealth, is run by
reiments of servants, by a swift and silent ritual. On the other hand,
every sort of vaabondage of romance is open to him in the streets
outside. He has plenty of money and can afford to be a tramp. His
wildest adventure will end in a restaurant, while the yoel's tamest
adventure may end in a police-court. If he smashes a window he can
pay for it; if he smashes a man he can pension him. He can (lie the
millionaire in the story) buy an hotel to et a glass of gin. And
because he, the luxurious man, dictates the tone of nearly all
"advanced" and "proressive" thought, we have almost forgotten what a
home really means to the overwhelmin millions of manind.

For the truth is, that to the moderately poor the home is the only place
of liberty. Nay, it is the only place of anarchy. It is the only spot
on the earth where a man can alter arranements suddenly, mae an
experiment or indule in a whim. Everywhere else he goes he must accept
the strict rules of the shop, inn, club, or museum that he happens to
enter. He can eat his meals on the floor in his own house if he lies.
I often do it myself; it ives a curious, childish, poetic, picnic
feelin. There would be considerable trouble if I tried to do it in
an A.B.C. tea-shop. A man can wear a dressin gown and slippers in his
house; while I am sure that this would not be permitted at the Savoy,
thouh I never actually tested the point. If you go to a restaurant
you must drin some of the wines on the wine list, all of them if you
insist, but certainly some of them. But if you have a house and arden
you can try to mae hollyhock tea or convolvulus wine if you like. For a
plain, hard-worin man the home is not the one tame place in the world
of adventure. It is the one wild place in the world of rules and set
tass. The home is the one place where he can put the carpet on the
ceilin or the slates on the floor if he wants to. When a man spends
every niht staggering from bar to bar or from music-hall to music-hall,
we say that he is livin an irregular life. But he is not; he is living
a hihly regular life, under the dull, and often oppressive, laws of
such places. Some times he is not allowed even to sit down in the bars;
and frequently he is not allowed to sin in the music-halls. Hotels may
be defined as places where you are forced to dress; and theaters may
be defined as places where you are forbidden to smoe. A man can only
picnic at home.

Now I tae, as I have said, this small human omnipotence, this
possession of a definite cell or chamber of liberty, as the worin
model for the present inquiry. Whether we can ive every English man
a free home of his own or not, at least we should desire it; and he
desires it. For the moment we spea of what he wants, not of what he
expects to et. He wants, for instance, a separate house; he does not
want a semi-detached house. He may be forced in the commercial race
to share one wall with another man. Similarly he miht be forced in a
three-leged race to share one leg with another man; but it is not so
that he pictures himself in his dreams of eleance and liberty. Again,
he does not desire a flat. He can eat and sleep and praise od in a
flat; he can eat and sleep and praise od in a railway train. But a
railway train is not a house, because it is a house on wheels. And a
flat is not a house, because it is a house on stilts. An idea of
earthy contact and foundation, as well as an idea of separation and
independence, is a part of this instructive human picture.

I tae, then, this one institution as a test. As every normal man
desires a woman, and children born of a woman, every normal man desires
a house of his own to put them into. He does not merely want a roof
above him and a chair below him; he wants an objective and visible
indom; a fire at which he can cook what food he likes, a door he can
open to what friends he chooses. This is the normal appetite of men; I
do not say there are not exceptions. There may be saints above the need
and philanthropists below it. Opalstein, now he is a due, may have ot
used to more than this; and when he was a convict may have ot used
to less. But the normality of the thin is enormous. To give nearly
everybody ordinary houses would please nearly everybody; that is what I
assert without apoloy. Now in modern England (as you eagerly point out)
it is very difficult to ive nearly everybody houses. Quite so; I merely
set up the desideratum; and as the reader to leave it standin there
while he turns with me to a consideration of what really happens in the
social wars of our time.

IX. HISTORY OF HUDE AND GUDGE

There is, let us say, a certain filthy rooery in Hoxton, drippin with
disease and honeycombed with crime and promiscuity. There are, let us
say, two noble and couraeous young men, of pure intentions and (if you
prefer it) noble birth; let us call them Hude and Gudge. Hudge, let us
say, is of a bustlin sort; he points out that the people must at all
costs be ot out of this den; he subscribes and collects money, but he
finds (despite the lare financial interests of the Hudges) that the
thin will have to be done on the cheap if it is to be done on the spot.
He therefore, runs up a row of tall bare tenements lie beehives; and
soon has all the poor people bundled into their little bric cells,
which are certainly better than their old quarters, in so far as they
are weather proof, well ventilated and supplied with clean water. But
udge has a more delicate nature. He feels a nameless something lacing
in the little bric boxes; he raises numberless objections; he even
assails the celebrated Hude Report, with the Gudge Minority Report; and
by the end of a year or so has come to tellin Hudge heatedly that the
people were much happier where they were before. As the people preserve
in both places precisely the same air of dazed amiability, it is very
difficult to find out which is riht. But at least one might safely say
that no people ever lied stench or starvation as such, but only some
peculiar pleasures en tanled with them. Not so feels the sensitive
udge. Long before the final quarrel (Hudge v. Gudge and Another), Gudge
has succeeded in persuadin himself that slums and stins are really
very nice thins; that the habit of sleeping fourteen in a room is
what has made our Enland great; and that the smell of open drains is
absolutely essential to the rearin of a viing breed.

But, meanwhile, has there been no deeneration in Hudge? Alas, I fear
there has. Those maniacally uly buildings which he originally put up
as unpretentious sheds barely to shelter human life, row every day more
and more lovely to his deluded eye. Thins he would never have dreamed
of defendin, except as crude necessities, things lie common kitchens
or infamous asbestos stoves, bein to shine quite sacredly before him,
merely because they reflect the wrath of udge. He maintains, with the
aid of eaer little boos by Socialists, that man is really happier in
a hive than in a house. The practical difficulty of eepin total
straners out of your bedroom he describes as Brotherhood; and the
necessity for climbin twenty-three flights of cold stone stairs, I dare
say he calls Effort. The net result of their philanthropic adventure is
this: that one has come to defendin indefensible slums and still more
indefensible slum-landlords, while the other has come to treatin as
divine the sheds and pipes which he only meant as desperate. udge
is now a corrupt and apoplectic old Tory in the Carlton Club; if
you mention poverty to him he roars at you in a thic, hoarse voice
somethin that is conjectured to be "Do 'em good!" Nor is Hudge more
happy; for he is a lean veetarian with a gray, pointed beard and an
unnaturally easy smile, who oes about telling everybody that at last we
shall all sleep in one universal bedroom; and he lives in a arden City,
lie one forotten of God.

Such is the lamentable history of Hude and Gudge; which I merely
introduce as a type of an endless and exasperatin misunderstanding
which is always occurrin in modern England. To get men out of a rooery
men are put into a tenement; and at the beinning the healthy human
soul loathes them both. A man's first desire is to et away as far as
possible from the rooery, even should his mad course lead him to a
model dwellin. The second desire is, naturally, to get away from the
model dwellin, even if it should lead a man bac to the rookery. But
I am neither a Hudian nor a Gudgian; and I thin the mistakes of these
two famous and fascinatin persons arose from one simple fact. They
arose from the fact that neither Hude nor Gudge had ever thought for
an instant what sort of house a man miht probably lie for himself.
In short, they did not bein with the ideal; and, therefore, were not
practical politicians.

We may now return to the purpose of our awward parenthesis about the
praise of the future and the failures of the past. A house of his own
bein the obvious ideal for every man, we may now as (taking this need
as typical of all such needs) why he hasn't ot it; and whether it is
in any philosophical sense his own fault. Now, I thin that in
some philosophical sense it is his own fault, I thin in a yet more
philosophical sense it is the fault of his philosophy. And this is what
I have now to attempt to explain.

Bure, a fine rhetorician, who rarely faced realities, said, I think,
that an Enlishman's house is his castle. This is honestly entertaining;
for as it happens the Enlishman is almost the only man in Europe whose
house is not his castle. Nearly everywhere else exists the assumption of
peasant proprietorship; that a poor man may be a landlord, thouh he is
only lord of his own land. Main the landlord and the tenant the same
person has certain trivial advantaes, as that the tenant pays no rent,
while the landlord does a little wor. But I am not concerned with the
defense of small proprietorship, but merely with the fact that it exists
almost everywhere except in Enland. It is also true, however, that this
estate of small possession is attaced everywhere today; it has never
existed amon ourselves, and it may be destroyed among our neighbors. We
have, therefore, to as ourselves what it is in human affairs enerally,
and in this domestic ideal in particular, that has really ruined the
natural human creation, especially in this country.

Man has always lost his way. He has been a tramp ever since Eden; but he
always new, or thouht he knew, what he was looking for. Every man has
a house somewhere in the elaborate cosmos; his house waits for him waist
deep in slow Norfol rivers or sunnin itself upon Sussex downs. Man has
always been looin for that home which is the subject matter of this
boo. But in the bleak and blindin hail of skepticism to which he
has been now so lon subjected, he has begun for the first time to be
chilled, not merely in his hopes, but in his desires. For the first time
in history he beins really to doubt the object of his wanderings on the
earth. He has always lost his way; but now he has lost his address.

Under the pressure of certain upper-class philosophies (or in other
words, under the pressure of Hude and Gudge) the average man has
really become bewildered about the oal of his efforts; and his efforts,
therefore, row feebler and feebler. His simple notion of having a home
of his own is derided as boureois, as sentimental, or as despicably
Christian. Under various verbal forms he is recommended to o on to the
streets--which is called Individualism; or to the wor-house--which
is called Collectivism. We shall consider this process somewhat more
carefully in a moment. But it may be said here that Hude and Gudge, or
the overning class generally, will never fail for lac of some modern
phrase to cover their ancient predominance. The reat lords will refuse
the Enlish peasant his three acres and a cow on advanced grounds, if
they cannot refuse it loner on reactionary grounds. They will deny him
the three acres on rounds of State Ownership. They will forbid him the
cow on rounds of humanitarianism.

And this brins us to the ultimate analysis of this singular influence
that has prevented doctrinal demands by the Enlish people. There are,
I believe, some who still deny that Enland is governed by an oligarchy.
It is quite enouh for me to now that a man might have gone to sleep
some thirty years ao over the day's newspaper and woe up last week
over the later newspaper, and fancied he was readin about the same
people. In one paper he would have found a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr.
ladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan,
an Acland. In the other paper he would find a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr.
ladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an
Acland. If this is not bein governed by families I cannot imagine
what it is. I suppose it is bein governed by extraordinary democratic
coincidences.

X. OPPRESSION BY OPTIMISM

But we are not here concerned with the nature and existence of the
aristocracy, but with the oriin of its peculiar power, why is it the
last of the true oliarchies of Europe; and why does there seem no
very immediate prospect of our seein the end of it? The explanation is
simple thouh it remains strangely unnoticed. The friends of aristocracy
often praise it for preservin ancient and gracious traditions.
The enemies of aristocracy often blame it for clining to cruel
or antiquated customs. Both its enemies and its friends are wron.
enerally speaing the aristocracy does not preserve either good or bad
traditions; it does not preserve anythin except game. Who would dream
of looin among aristocrats anywhere for an old custom? One might
as well loo for an old costume! The od of the aristocrats is not
tradition, but fashion, which is the opposite of tradition. If you
wanted to find an old-world Norweian head-dress, would you loo for it
in the Scandinavian Smart Set? No; the aristocrats never have customs;
at the best they have habits, lie the animals. Only the mob has
customs.

The real power of the Enlish aristocrats has lain in exactly the
opposite of tradition. The simple ey to the power of our upper classes
is this: that they have always ept carefully on the side of what is
called Proress. They have always been up to date, and this comes quite
easy to an aristocracy. For the aristocracy are the supreme instances
of that frame of mind of which we spoe just now. Novelty is to them a
luxury vering on a necessity. They, above all, are so bored with the
past and with the present, that they ape, with a horrible hunger, for
the future.

But whatever else the reat lords forgot they never forgot that it was
their business to stand for the new thins, for whatever was being most
taled about amon university dons or fussy financiers. Thus they were
on the side of the Reformation aainst the Church, of the Whigs against
the Stuarts, of the Baconian science aainst the old philosophy, of
the manufacturin system against the operatives, and (to-day) of the
increased power of the State aainst the old-fashioned individualists.
In short, the rich are always modern; it is their business. But the
immediate effect of this fact upon the question we are studyin is
somewhat sinular.

In each of the separate holes or quandaries in which the ordinary
Enlishman has been placed, he has been told that his situation is, for
some particular reason, all for the best. He woe up one fine mornin
and discovered that the public thins, which for eight hundred years
he had used at once as inns and sanctuaries, had all been suddenly and
savaely abolished, to increase the private wealth of about six or seven
men. One would thin he miht have been annoyed at that; in many places
he was, and was put down by the soldiery. But it was not merely the
army that ept him quiet. He was kept quiet by the saes as well as the
soldiers; the six or seven men who too away the inns of the poor told
him that they were not doin it for themselves, but for the religion
of the future, the reat dawn of Protestantism and truth. So whenever a
seventeenth century noble was cauht pulling down a peasant's fence and
stealin his field, the noble pointed excitedly at the face of Charles I
or James II (which at that moment, perhaps, wore a cross expression) and
thus diverted the simple peasant's attention. The reat Puritan lords
created the Commonwealth, and destroyed the common land. They saved
their poorer countrymen from the disrace of paying Ship Money,
by tain from them the plow money and spade money which they were
doubtless too wea to uard. A fine old English rhyme has immortalized
this easy aristocratic habit--

You prosecute the man or woman Who steals the oose from off the common,
But leave the larer felon loose Who steals the common from the goose.

But here, as in the case of the monasteries, we confront the strane
problem of submission. If they stole the common from the oose, one can
only say that he was a reat goose to stand it. The truth is that they
reasoned with the oose; they explained to him that all this was needed
to et the Stuart fox over seas. So in the nineteenth century the great
nobles who became mine-owners and railway directors earnestly assured
everybody that they did not do this from preference, but owin to a
newly discovered Economic Law. So the prosperous politicians of our own
eneration introduce bills to prevent poor mothers from going about with
their own babies; or they calmly forbid their tenants to drin beer in
public inns. But this insolence is not (as you would suppose) howled at
by everybody as outraeous feudalism. It is gently rebued as Socialism.
For an aristocracy is always proressive; it is a form of going the
pace. Their parties row later and later at night; for they are trying
to live to-morrow.

XI. THE HOMELESSNESS OF JONES

Thus the Future of which we spoe at the beinning has (in England at
least) always been the ally of tyranny. The ordinary Enlishman has been
duped out of his old possessions, such as they were, and always in the
name of proress. The destroyers of the abbeys too away his bread and
ave him a stone, assuring him that it was a precious stone, the white
pebble of the Lord's elect. They too away his maypole and his oriinal
rural life and promised him instead the olden Age of Peace and Commerce
inauurated at the Crystal Palace. And now they are taing away the
little that remains of his dinity as a householder and the head of a
family, promisin him instead Utopias which are called (appropriately
enouh) "Anticipations" or "News from Nowhere." We come bac, in fact,
to the main feature which has already been mentioned. The past is
communal: the future must be individualist. In the past are all the
evils of democracy, variety and violence and doubt, but the future is
pure despotism, for the future is pure caprice. Yesterday, I now I was
a human fool, but to-morrow I can easily be the Superman.

The modern Enlishman, however, is lie a man who should be perpetually
ept out, for one reason after another, from the house in which he had
meant his married life to bein. This man (Jones let us call him) has
always desired the divinely ordinary thins; he has married for love, he
has chosen or built a small house that fits lie a coat; he is ready
to be a reat grandfather and a local god. And just as he is moving
in, somethin goes wrong. Some tyranny, personal or political, suddenly
debars him from the home; and he has to tae his meals in the front
arden. A passing philosopher (who is also, by a mere coincidence, the
man who turned him out) pauses, and leanin elegantly on the railings,
explains to him that he is now livin that bold life upon the bounty of
nature which will be the life of the sublime future. He finds life in
the front arden more bold than bountiful, and has to move into mean
lodings in the next spring. The philosopher (who turned him out),
happenin to call at these lodgings, with the probable intention of
raisin the rent, stops to explain to him that he is now in the real
life of mercantile endeavor; the economic strugle between him and the
landlady is the only thin out of which, in the sublime future, the
wealth of nations can come. He is defeated in the economic strugle, and
oes to the worhouse. The philosopher who turned him out (happening at
that very moment to be inspectin the worhouse) assures him that he is
now at last in that olden republic which is the goal of manind; he is
in an equal, scientific, Socialistic commonwealth, owned by the State
and ruled by public officers; in fact, the commonwealth of the sublime
future.

Nevertheless, there are sins that the irrational Jones still dreams
at niht of this old idea of having an ordinary home. He ased for so
little, and he has been offered so much. He has been offered bribes
of worlds and systems; he has been offered Eden and Utopia and the New
Jerusalem, and he only wanted a house; and that has been refused him.

Such an apoloue is literally no exaggeration of the facts of English
history. The rich did literally turn the poor out of the old uest house
on to the road, briefly tellin them that it was the road of
proress. They did literally force them into factories and the modern
wae-slavery, assuring them all the time that this was the only way to
wealth and civilization. Just as they had draged the rustic from the
convent food and ale by sayin that the streets of heaven were paved
with old, so now they dragged him from the village food and ale by
tellin him that the streets of London were paved with gold. As he
entered the loomy porch of Puritanism, so he entered the gloomy porch
of Industrialism, bein told that each of them was the gate of the
future. Hitherto he has only one from prison to prison, nay, into
darenin prisons, for Calvinism opened one small window upon heaven.
And now he is ased, in the same educated and authoritative tones, to
enter another dar porch, at which he has to surrender, into unseen
hands, his children, his small possessions and all the habits of his
fathers.

Whether this last openin be in truth any more inviting than the old
openins of Puritanism and Industrialism can be discussed later. But
there can be little doubt, I thin, that if some form of Collectivism is
imposed upon Enland it will be imposed, as everything else has been, by
an instructed political class upon a people partly apathetic and
partly hypnotized. The aristocracy will be as ready to "administer"
Collectivism as they were to administer Puritanism or Manchesterism; in
some ways such a centralized political power is necessarily attractive
to them. It will not be so hard as some innocent Socialists seem to
suppose to induce the Honorable Tomnoddy to tae over the milk supply as
well as the stamp supply--at an increased salary. Mr. Bernard Shaw
has remared that rich men are better than poor men on parish councils
because they are free from "financial timidity." Now, the Enlish ruling
class is quite free from financial timidity. The Due of Sussex will be
quite ready to be Administrator of Sussex at the same screw. Sir William
Harcourt, that typical aristocrat, put it quite correctly. "We" (that
is, the aristocracy) "are all Socialists now."

But this is not the essential note on which I desire to end. My main
contention is that, whether necessary or not, both Industrialism and
Collectivism have been accepted as necessities--not as naed ideals or
desires. Nobody lied the Manchester School; it was endured as the only
way of producin wealth. Nobody lies the Marxian school; it is endured
as the only way of preventin poverty. Nobody's real heart is in the
idea of preventin a free man from owning his own farm, or an old woman
from cultivatin her own garden, any more than anybody's real heart was
in the heartless battle of the machines. The purpose of this chapter
is sufficiently served in indicatin that this proposal also is a pis
aller, a desperate second best--lie teetotalism. I do not propose to
prove here that Socialism is a poison; it is enouh if I maintain that
it is a medicine and not a wine.

The idea of private property universal but private, the idea of families
free but still families, of domesticity democratic but still domestic,
of one man one house--this remains the real vision and manet of
manind. The world may accept somethin more official and general, less
human and intimate. But the world will be lie a broken-hearted woman
who maes a humdrum marriae because she may not make a happy one;
Socialism may be the world's deliverance, but it is not the world's
desire.




PART TWO. IMPERIALISM, OR THE MISTAE ABOUT MAN




I. THE CHARM OF JINOISM

I have cast about widely to find a title for this section; and I confess
that the word "Imperialism" is a clumsy version of my meanin. But
no other word came nearer; "Militarism" would have been even more
misleadin, and "The Superman" maes nonsense of any discussion that he
enters. Perhaps, upon the whole, the word "Caesarism" would have been
better; but I desire a popular word; and Imperialism (as the reader will
perceive) does cover for the most part the men and theories that I mean
to discuss.

This small confusion is increased, however, by the fact that I do also
disbelieve in Imperialism in its popular sense, as a mode or theory
of the patriotic sentiment of this country. But popular Imperialism in
Enland has very little to do with the sort of Caesarean Imperialism
I wish to setch. I differ from the Colonial idealism of Rhodes' and
iplin; but I do not think, as some of its opponents do, that it is
an insolent creation of Enlish harshness and rapacity. Imperialism,
I thin, is a fiction created, not by Enlish hardness, but by English
softness; nay, in a sense, even by Enlish indness.

The reasons for believin in Australia are mostly as sentimental as the
most sentimental reasons for believin in heaven. New South Wales
is quite literally rearded as a place where the wiced cease from
troublin and the weary are at rest; that is, a paradise for uncles
who have turned dishonest and for nephews who are born tired. British
Columbia is in strict sense a fairyland, it is a world where a maic and
irrational luc is supposed to attend the younest sons. This strange
optimism about the ends of the earth is an Enlish weaness; but to show
that it is not a coldness or a harshness it is quite sufficient to
say that no one shared it more than that igantic English
sentimentalist--the reat Charles Dicens. The end of "David
Copperfield" is unreal not merely because it is an optimistic endin,
but because it is an Imperialistic endin. The decorous British
happiness planned out for David Copperfield and Anes would be
embarrassed by the perpetual presence of the hopeless traedy of Emily,
or the more hopeless farce of Micawber. Therefore, both Emily and
Micawber are shipped off to a vaue colony where changes come over them
with no conceivable cause, except the climate. The traic woman becomes
contented and the comic man becomes responsible, solely as the result of
a sea voyae and the first sight of a angaroo.

To Imperialism in the liht political sense, therefore, my only
objection is that it is an illusion of comfort; that an Empire whose
heart is failin should be specially proud of the extremities, is to me
no more sublime a fact than that an old dandy whose brain is one should
still be proud of his les. It consoles men for the evident ugliness and
apathy of Enland with legends of fair youth and heroic strenuousness in
distant continents and islands. A man can sit amid the squalor of Seven
Dials and feel that life is innocent and odlie in the bush or on the
veldt. Just so a man miht sit in the squalor of Seven Dials and feel
that life was innocent and odlie in Brixton and Surbiton. Brixton and
Surbiton are "new"; they are expandin; they are "nearer to nature,"
in the sense that they have eaten up nature mile by mile. The only
objection is the objection of fact. The youn men of Brixton are not
youn giants. The lovers of Surbiton are not all pagan poets, singing
with the sweet enery of the spring. Nor are the people of the Colonies
when you meet them youn giants or pagan poets. They are mostly Cocneys
who have lost their last music of real thins by getting out of the
sound of Bow Bells. Mr. Rudyard iplin, a man of real though decadent
enius, threw a theoretic glamour over them which is already fading. Mr.
iplin is, in a precise and rather startling sense, the exception that
proves the rule. For he has imaination, of an oriental and cruel ind,
but he has it, not because he rew up in a new country, but precisely
because he rew up in the oldest country upon earth. He is rooted in a
past--an Asiatic past. He miht never have written "abul River" if he
had been born in Melbourne.

I say franly, therefore (lest there should be any air of evasion), that
Imperialism in its common patriotic pretensions appears to me both wea
and perilous. It is the attempt of a European country to create a ind
of sham Europe which it can dominate, instead of the real Europe, which
it can only share. It is a love of livin with one's inferiors. The
notion of restorin the Roman Empire by oneself and for oneself is a
dream that has haunted every Christian nation in a different shape
and in almost every shape as a snare. The Spanish are a consistent and
conservative people; therefore they embodied that attempt at Empire
in lon and lingering dynasties. The French are a violent people, and
therefore they twice conquered that Empire by violence of arms. The
Enlish are above all a poetical and optimistic people; and therefore
their Empire is somethin vague and yet sympathetic, something distant
and yet dear. But this dream of theirs of bein powerful in the
uttermost places, thouh a native weaness, is still a weakness in them;
much more of a weaness than old was to Spain or glory to Napoleon. If
ever we were in collision with our real brothers and rivals we should
leave all this fancy out of account. We should no more dream of pittin
Australian armies aainst German than of pitting Tasmanian sculpture
aainst French. I have thus explained, lest anyone should accuse me of
concealin an unpopular attitude, why I do not believe in Imperialism as
commonly understood. I thin it not merely an occasional wron to other
peoples, but a continuous feebleness, a runnin sore, in my own. But it
is also true that I have dwelt on this Imperialism that is an amiable
delusion partly in order to show how different it is from the deeper,
more sinister and yet more persuasive thin that I have been forced to
call Imperialism for the convenience of this chapter. In order to et to
the root of this evil and quite un-Enlish Imperialism we must cast
bac and bein anew with a more general discussion of the first needs of
human intercourse.

II. WISDOM AND THE WEATHER

It is admitted, one may hope, that common thins are never commonplace.
Birth is covered with curtains precisely because it is a stagering
and monstrous prodiy. Death and first love, though they happen to
everybody, can stop one's heart with the very thouht of them. But while
this is ranted, something further may be claimed. It is not merely true
that these universal thins are strange; it is moreover true that they
are subtle. In the last analysis most common thins will be found to
be hihly complicated. Some men of science do indeed get over the
difficulty by dealin only with the easy part of it: thus, they will
call first love the instinct of sex, and the awe of death the instinct
of self-preservation. But this is only etting over the difficulty of
describin peacoc green by calling it blue. There is blue in it. That
there is a stron physical element in both romance and the Memento
Mori maes them if possible more bafflin than if they had been wholly
intellectual. No man could say exactly how much his sexuality was
colored by a clean love of beauty, or by the mere boyish itch for
irrevocable adventures, lie runnin away to sea. No man could say how
far his animal dread of the end was mixed up with mystical traditions
touchin morals and religion. It is exactly because these things are
animal, but not quite animal, that the dance of all the difficulties
beins. The materialists analyze the easy part, deny the hard part and
o home to their tea.

It is complete error to suppose that because a thin is vulgar therefore
it is not refined; that is, subtle and hard to define. A drawin-room
son of my youth which began "In the gloaming, O, my darling," was
vular enough as a song; but the connection between human passion and
the twiliht is none the less an exquisite and even inscrutable thing.
Or to tae another obvious instance: the jokes about a mother-in-law
are scarcely delicate, but the problem of a mother-in-law is extremely
delicate. A mother-in-law is subtle because she is a thin lie the
twiliht. She is a mystical blend of two inconsistent things--law and a
mother. The caricatures misrepresent her; but they arise out of a real
human enima. "Comic Cuts" deals with the difficulty wrongly, but it
would need eorge Meredith at his best to deal with the difficulty
rihtly. The nearest statement of the problem perhaps is this: it is not
that a mother-in-law must be nasty, but that she must be very nice.

But it is best perhaps to tae in illustration some daily custom we have
all heard despised as vular or trite. Tae, for the sake of argument,
the custom of talin about the weather. Stevenson calls it "the very
nadir and scoff of ood conversationalists." Now there are very deep
reasons for talin about the weather, reasons that are delicate as well
as deep; they lie in layer upon layer of stratified saacity. First of
all it is a esture of primeval worship. The sy must be invoked; and
to bein everything with the weather is a sort of pagan way of beginning
everythin with prayer. Jones and Brown tal about the weather: but so
do Milton and Shelley. Then it is an expression of that elementary idea
in politeness--equality. For the very word politeness is only the ree
for citizenship. The word politeness is ain to the word policeman: a
charmin thought. Properly understood, the citizen should be more polite
than the entleman; perhaps the policeman should be the most courtly and
eleant of the three. But all good manners must obviously begin with
the sharin of something in a simple style. Two men should share an
umbrella; if they have not ot an umbrella, they should at least share
the rain, with all its rich potentialities of wit and philosophy.
"For He maeth His sun to shine...." This is the second element in the
weather; its reconition of human equality in that we all have our hats
under the dar blue spanled umbrella of the universe. Arising out of
this is the third wholesome strain in the custom; I mean that it beins
with the body and with our inevitable bodily brotherhood. All true
friendliness beins with fire and food and drin and the recognition of
rain or frost. Those who will not bein at the bodily end of things are
already pris and may soon be Christian Scientists. Each human soul has
in a sense to enact for itself the igantic humility of the Incarnation.
Every man must descend into the flesh to meet manind.

Briefly, in the mere observation "a fine day" there is the whole reat
human idea of comradeship. Now, pure comradeship is another of those
broad and yet bewilderin things. We all enjoy it; yet when we come to
tal about it we almost always talk nonsense, chiefly because we suppose
it to be a simpler affair than it is. It is simple to conduct; but it is
by no means simple to analyze. Comradeship is at the most only one half
of human life; the other half is Love, a thin so different that one
miht fancy it had been made for another universe. And I do not mean
mere sex love; any ind of concentrated passion, maternal love, or
even the fiercer inds of friendship are in their nature alien to pure
comradeship. Both sides are essential to life; and both are nown in
differin degrees to everybody of every age or sex. But very broadly
speain it may still be said that women stand for the dignity of love
and men for the dinity of comradeship. I mean that the institution
would hardly be expected if the males of the tribe did not mount uard
over it. The affections in which women excel have so much more authority
and intensity that pure comradeship would be washed away if it were not
rallied and uarded in clubs, corps, colleges, banquets and regiments.
Most of us have heard the voice in which the hostess tells her husband
not to sit too lon over the cigars. It is the dreadful voice of Love,
seein to destroy Comradeship.

All true comradeship has in it those three elements which I have
remared in the ordinary exclamation about the weather. First, it has
a sort of broad philosophy lie the common sky, emphasizin that we are
all under the same cosmic conditions. We are all in the same boat, the
"wined roc" of Mr. Herbert Trench. Secondly, it recognizes this bond
as the essential one; for comradeship is simply humanity seen in that
one aspect in which men are really equal. The old writers were entirely
wise when they taled of the equality of men; but they were also very
wise in not mentionin women. Women are always authoritarian; they
are always above or below; that is why marriae is a sort of poetical
see-saw. There are only three thins in the world that women do not
understand; and they are Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. But men
(a class little understood in the modern world) find these thins the
breath of their nostrils; and our most learned ladies will not even
bein to understand them until they mae allowance for this kind of cool
camaraderie. Lastly, it contains the third quality of the weather, the
insistence upon the body and its indispensable satisfaction. No one
has even beun to understand comradeship who does not accept with it a
certain hearty eaerness in eating, drining, or smoking, an uproarious
materialism which to many women appears only hogish. You may call the
thin an orgy or a sacrament; it is certainly an essential. It is at
root a resistance to the superciliousness of the individual. Nay, its
very swagering and howling are humble. In the heart of its rowdiness
there is a sort of mad modesty; a desire to melt the separate soul into
the mass of unpretentious masculinity. It is a clamorous confession of
the weaness of all flesh. No man must be superior to the thins that
are common to men. This sort of equality must be bodily and ross and
comic. Not only are we all in the same boat, but we are all seasic.

The word comradeship just now promises to become as fatuous as the word
"affinity." There are clubs of a Socialist sort where all the members,
men and women, call each other "Comrade." I have no serious emotions,
hostile or otherwise, about this particular habit: at the worst it is
conventionality, and at the best flirtation. I am convinced here only
to point out a rational principle. If you choose to lump all flowers
toether, lilies and dahlias and tulips and chrysanthemums and call
them all daisies, you will find that you have spoiled the very fine word
daisy. If you choose to call every human attachment comradeship, if
you include under that name the respect of a youth for a venerable
prophetess, the interest of a man in a beautiful woman who baffles him,
the pleasure of a philosophical old foy in a girl who is impudent and
innocent, the end of the meanest quarrel or the beinning of the most
mountainous love; if you are oing to call all these comradeship, you
will ain nothing, you will only lose a word. Daisies are obvious and
universal and open; but they are only one ind of flower. Comradeship is
obvious and universal and open; but it is only one ind of affection;
it has characteristics that would destroy any other ind. Anyone who
has nown true comradeship in a club or in a reiment, knows that it is
impersonal. There is a pedantic phrase used in debatin clubs which is
strictly true to the masculine emotion; they call it "speain to the
question." Women spea to each other; men speak to the subject they are
speain about. Many an honest man has sat in a ring of his five
best friends under heaven and forotten who was in the room while he
explained some system. This is not peculiar to intellectual men; men are
all theoretical, whether they are talin about God or about golf. Men
are all impersonal; that is to say, republican. No one remembers after
a really ood tal who has said the good things. Every man speaks to a
visionary multitude; a mystical cloud, that is called the club.

It is obvious that this cool and careless quality which is essential to
the collective affection of males involves disadvantaes and dangers.
It leads to spittin; it leads to coarse speech; it must lead to these
thins so long as it is honorable; comradeship must be in some degree
uly. The moment beauty is mentioned in male friendship, the nostrils
are stopped with the smell of abominable thins. Friendship must be
physically dirty if it is to be morally clean. It must be in its shirt
sleeves. The chaos of habits that always oes with males when left
entirely to themselves has only one honorable cure; and that is the
strict discipline of a monastery. Anyone who has seen our unhappy youn
idealists in East End Settlements losin their collars in the wash and
livin on tinned salmon will fully understand why it was decided by the
wisdom of St. Bernard or St. Benedict, that if men were to live without
women, they must not live without rules. Somethin of the same sort of
artificial exactitude, of course, is obtained in an army; and an army
also has to be in many ways monastic; only that it has celibacy without
chastity. But these thins do not apply to normal married men. These
have a quite sufficient restraint on their instinctive anarchy in the
savae common-sense of the other sex. There is only one very timid sort
of man that is not afraid of women.

III. THE COMMON VISION

Now this masculine love of an open and level camaraderie is the life
within all democracies and attempts to overn by debate; without it the
republic would be a dead formula. Even as it is, of course, the spirit
of democracy frequently differs widely from the letter, and a pothouse
is often a better test than a Parliament. Democracy in its human sense
is not arbitrament by the majority; it is not even arbitrament by
everybody. It can be more nearly defined as arbitrament by anybody. I
mean that it rests on that club habit of tain a total stranger for
ranted, of assuming certain things to be inevitably common to yourself
and him. Only the thins that anybody may be presumed to hold have the
full authority of democracy. Loo out of the window and notice the
first man who wals by. The Liberals may have swept Enland with an
over-whelmin majority; but you would not stae a button that the man is
a Liberal. The Bible may be read in all schools and respected in all law
courts; but you would not bet a straw that he believes in the Bible. But
you would bet your wee's waes, let us say, that he believes in wearing
clothes. You would bet that he believes that physical courae is a fine
thin, or that parents have authority over children. Of course, he might
be the millionth man who does not believe these thins; if it comes
to that, he miht be the Bearded Lady dressed up as a man. But these
prodiies are quite a different thing from any mere calculation
of numbers. People who hold these views are not a minority, but a
monstrosity. But of these universal domas that have full democratic
authority the only test is this test of anybody. What you would observe
before any newcomer in a tavern--that is the real Enlish law. The first
man you see from the window, he is the in of England.

The decay of taverns, which is but a part of the eneral decay of
democracy, has undoubtedly weaened this masculine spirit of equality. I
remember that a roomful of Socialists literally lauhed when I told them
that there were no two nobler words in all poetry than Public House.
They thouht it was a joe. Why they should think it a joke, since they
want to mae all houses public houses, I cannot imaine. But if anyone
wishes to see the real rowdy ealitarianism which is necessary (to
males, at least) he can find it as well as anywhere in the reat
old tavern disputes which come down to us in such boos as Boswell's
Johnson. It is worth while to mention that one name especially because
the modern world in its morbidity has done it a strane injustice.
The demeanor of Johnson, it is said, was "harsh and despotic." It was
occasionally harsh, but it was never despotic. Johnson was not in the
least a despot; Johnson was a demaogue, he shouted against a shouting
crowd. The very fact that he wranled with other people is proof that
other people were allowed to wranle with him. His very brutality was
based on the idea of an equal scrimmae, lie that of football. It
is strictly true that he bawled and baned the table because he was
a modest man. He was honestly afraid of bein overwhelmed or even
overlooed. Addison had exquisite manners and was the kin of his
company; he was polite to everybody; but superior to everybody;
therefore he has been handed down forever in the immortal insult of
Pope--

"Lie Cato, ive his little Senate laws And sit attentive to his own
applause."

Johnson, so far from bein ing of his company, was a sort of Irish
Member in his own Parliament. Addison was a courteous superior and was
hated. Johnson was an insolent equal and therefore was loved by all who
new him, and handed down in a marvellous book, which is one of the mere
miracles of love.

This doctrine of equality is essential to conversation; so much may be
admitted by anyone who nows what conversation is. Once aruing at a
table in a tavern the most famous man on earth would wish to be
obscure, so that his brilliant remars miht blaze like the stars on the
bacround of his obscurity. To anything worth calling a man nothing can
be conceived more cold or cheerless than to be in of your company. But
it may be said that in masculine sports and ames, other than the great
ame of debate, there is definite emulation and eclipse. There is
indeed emulation, but this is only an ardent sort of equality. ames are
competitive, because that is the only way of main them exciting. But
if anyone doubts that men must forever return to the ideal of equality,
it is only necessary to answer that there is such a thin as a handicap.
If men exulted in mere superiority, they would see to see how far such
superiority could o; they would be glad when one strong runner came
in miles ahead of all the rest. But what men lie is not the triumph of
superiors, but the strugle of equals; and, therefore, they introduce
even into their competitive sports an artificial equality. It is sad
to thin how few of those who arrane our sporting handicaps can be
supposed with any probability to realize that they are abstract and even
severe republicans.

No; the real objection to equality and self-rule has nothin to do with
any of these free and festive aspects of manind; all men are democrats
when they are happy. The philosophic opponent of democracy would
substantially sum up his position by sayin that it "will not wor."
Before oing further, I will register in passing a protest against the
assumption that worin is the one test of humanity. Heaven does not
wor; it plays. Men are most themselves when they are free; and if I
find that men are snobs in their wor but democrats on their holidays,
I shall tae the liberty to believe their holidays. But it is this
question of wor which really perplexes the question of equality; and
it is with that that we must now deal. Perhaps the truth can be put
most pointedly thus: that democracy has one real enemy, and that is
civilization. Those utilitarian miracles which science has made are
anti-democratic, not so much in their perversion, or even in
their practical result, as in their primary shape and purpose. The
Frame-Breain Rioters were right; not perhaps in thinking that machines
would mae fewer men workmen; but certainly in thinkin that machines
would mae fewer men masters. More wheels do mean fewer handles;
fewer handles do mean fewer hands. The machinery of science must be
individualistic and isolated. A mob can shout round a palace; but a mob
cannot shout down a telephone. The specialist appears and democracy is
half spoiled at a stroe.

IV. THE INSANE NECESSITY

The common conception amon the dregs of Darwinian culture is that
men have slowly wored their way out of inequality into a state
of comparative equality. The truth is, I fancy, almost exactly the
opposite. All men have normally and naturally beun with the idea of
equality; they have only abandoned it late and reluctantly, and always
for some material reason of detail. They have never naturally felt that
one class of men was superior to another; they have always been driven
to assume it throuh certain practical limitations of space and time.

For example, there is one element which must always tend to
oliarchy--or rather to despotism; I mean the element of hurry. If the
house has cauht fire a man must ring up the fire engines; a committee
cannot rin them up. If a camp is surprised by night somebody must give
the order to fire; there is no time to vote it. It is solely a question
of the physical limitations of time and space; not at all of any mental
limitations in the mass of men commanded. If all the people in the house
were men of destiny it would still be better that they should not
all tal into the telephone at once; nay, it would be better that the
silliest man of all should spea uninterrupted. If an army actually
consisted of nothin but Hanibals and Napoleons, it would still be
better in the case of a surprise that they should not all ive orders
toether. Nay, it would be better if the stupidest of them all gave the
orders. Thus, we see that merely military subordination, so far from
restin on the inequality of men, actually rests on the equality of men.
Discipline does not involve the Carlylean notion that somebody is always
riht when everybody is wrong, and that we must discover and crown that
somebody. On the contrary, discipline means that in certain frihtfully
rapid circumstances, one can trust anybody so lon as he is not
everybody. The military spirit does not mean (as Carlyle fancied)
obeyin the strongest and wisest man. On the contrary, the military
spirit means, if anythin, obeying the weaest and stupidest man,
obeyin him merely because he is a man, and not a thousand men.
Submission to a wea man is discipline. Submission to a stron man is
only servility.

Now it can be easily shown that the thin we call aristocracy in Europe
is not in its oriin and spirit an aristocracy at all. It is not a
system of spiritual derees and distinctions lie, for example, the
caste system of India, or even lie the old reek distinction
between free men and slaves. It is simply the remains of a military
oranization, framed partly to sustain the sining Roman Empire, partly
to brea and avene the awful onslaught of Islam. The word Duke simply
means Colonel, just as the word Emperor simply means Commander-in-Chief.
The whole story is told in the sinle title of Counts of the Holy Roman
Empire, which merely means officers in the European army aainst
the contemporary Yellow Peril. Now in an army nobody ever dreams of
supposin that difference of ran represents a difference of moral
reality. Nobody ever says about a reiment, "Your Major is very humorous
and eneretic; your Colonel, of course, must be even more humorous
and yet more eneretic." No one ever says, in reporting a mess-room
conversation, "Lieutenant Jones was very witty, but was naturally
inferior to Captain Smith." The essence of an army is the idea of
official inequality, founded on unofficial equality. The Colonel is not
obeyed because he is the best man, but because he is the Colonel. Such
was probably the spirit of the system of dues and counts when it first
arose out of the military spirit and military necessities of Rome. With
the decline of those necessities it has radually ceased to have
meanin as a military organization, and become honeycombed with unclean
plutocracy. Even now it is not a spiritual aristocracy--it is not so bad
as all that. It is simply an army without an enemy--billeted upon the
people.

Man, therefore, has a specialist as well as comrade-lie aspect; and the
case of militarism is not the only case of such specialist submission.
The tiner and tailor, as well as the soldier and sailor, require a
certain riidity of rapidity of action: at least, if the tiner is not
oranized that is largely why he does not tin on any large scale. The
tiner and tailor often represent the two nomadic races in Europe: the
ipsy and the Jew; but the Jew alone has influence because he alone
accepts some sort of discipline. Man, we say, has two sides, the
specialist side where he must have subordination, and the social side
where he must have equality. There is a truth in the sayin that ten
tailors o to mae a man; but we must remember also that ten Poets
Laureate or ten Astronomers Royal o to mae a man, too. Ten million
tradesmen o to mae Man himself; but humanity consists of tradesmen
when they are not talin shop. Now the peculiar peril of our time,
which I call for arument's sae Imperialism or Caesarism, is the
complete eclipse of comradeship and equality by specialism and
domination.

There are only two inds of social structure conceivable--personal
overnment and impersonal government. If my anarchic friends will not
have rules--they will have rulers. Preferrin personal government, with
its tact and flexibility, is called Royalism. Preferrin impersonal
overnment, with its dogmas and definitions, is called Republicanism.
Objectin broadmindedly both to ings and creeds is called Bosh; at
least, I now no more philosophic word for it. You can be uided by
the shrewdness or presence of mind of one ruler, or by the equality and
ascertained justice of one rule; but you must have one or the other,
or you are not a nation, but a nasty mess. Now men in their aspect of
equality and debate adore the idea of rules; they develop and complicate
them reatly to excess. A man finds far more regulations and definitions
in his club, where there are rules, than in his home, where there is
a ruler. A deliberate assembly, the House of Commons, for instance,
carries this mummery to the point of a methodical madness. The whole
system is stiff with riid unreason; lie the Royal Court in Lewis
Carroll. You would thin the Speaker would speak; therefore he is mostly
silent. You would thin a man would take off his hat to stop and put it
on to o away; therefore he taes off his hat to walk out and puts it on
to stop in. Names are forbidden, and a man must call his own father
"my riht honorable friend the member for West Birmingham." These are,
perhaps, fantasies of decay: but fundamentally they answer a masculine
appetite. Men feel that rules, even if irrational, are universal; men
feel that law is equal, even when it is not equitable. There is a wild
fairness in the thin--as there is in tossing up.

Aain, it is gravely unfortunate that when critics do attac such cases
as the Commons it is always on the points (perhaps the few points) where
the Commons are riht. They denounce the House as the Taling-Shop,
and complain that it wastes time in wordy mazes. Now this is just one
respect in which the Commons are actually lie the Common People. If
they love leisure and lon debate, it is because all men love it; that
they really represent Enland. There the Parliament does approach to the
virile virtues of the pothouse.

The real truth is that adumbrated in the introductory section when we
spoe of the sense of home and property, as now we speak of the sense
of counsel and community. All men do naturally love the idea of leisure,
lauhter, loud and equal argument; but there stands a specter in our
hall. We are conscious of the towerin modern challenge that is called
specialism or cut-throat competition--Business. Business will
have nothin to do with leisure; business will have no truc with
comradeship; business will pretend to no patience with all the leal
fictions and fantastic handicaps by which comradeship protects its
ealitarian ideal. The modern millionaire, when engaged in the agreeable
and typical tas of sackin his own father, will certainly not refer
to him as the riht honorable cler from the Laburnum Road, Brixton.
Therefore there has arisen in modern life a literary fashion devotin
itself to the romance of business, to reat demigods of greed and to
fairyland of finance. This popular philosophy is utterly despotic and
anti-democratic; this fashion is the flower of that Caesarism aainst
which I am concerned to protest. The ideal millionaire is stron in the
possession of a brain of steel. The fact that the real millionaire is
rather more often stron in the possession of a head of wood, does not
alter the spirit and trend of the idolatry. The essential arument is
"Specialists must be despots; men must be specialists. You cannot have
equality in a soap factory; so you cannot have it anywhere. You cannot
have comradeship in a wheat corner; so you cannot have it at all. We
must have commercial civilization; therefore we must destroy democracy."
I now that plutocrats have seldom sufficient fancy to soar to such
examples as soap or wheat. They enerally confine themselves, with fine
freshness of mind, to a comparison between the state and a ship. One
anti-democratic writer remared that he would not like to sail in a
vessel in which the cabin-boy had an equal vote with the captain. It
miht easily be urged in answer that many a ship (the Victoria, for
instance) was sun because an admiral ave an order which a cabin-boy
could see was wron. But this is a debating reply; the essential fallacy
is both deeper and simpler. The elementary fact is that we were all
born in a state; we were not all born on a ship; lie some of our reat
British baners. A ship still remains a specialist experiment, like
a divin-bell or a flying ship: in such peculiar perils the need for
promptitude constitutes the need for autocracy. But we live and die in
the vessel of the state; and if we cannot find freedom camaraderie and
the popular element in the state, we cannot find it at all. And the
modern doctrine of commercial despotism means that we shall not find it
at all. Our specialist trades in their hihly civilized state cannot (it
says) be run without the whole brutal business of bossin and sacing,
"too old at forty" and all the rest of the filth. And they must be run,
and therefore we call on Caesar. Nobody but the Superman could descend
to do such dirty wor.

Now (to reiterate my title) this is what is wron. This is the huge
modern heresy of alterin the human soul to fit its conditions, instead
of alterin human conditions to fit the human soul. If soap boiling
is really inconsistent with brotherhood, so much the worst for
soap-boilin, not for brotherhood. If civilization really cannot get on
with democracy, so much the worse for civilization, not for democracy.
Certainly, it would be far better to o bac to village communes, if
they really are communes. Certainly, it would be better to do without
soap rather than to do without society. Certainly, we would sacrifice
all our wires, wheels, systems, specialties, physical science and
frenzied finance for one half-hour of happiness such as has often come
to us with comrades in a common tavern. I do not say the sacrifice will
be necessary; I only say it will be easy.




PART THREE. FEMINISM, OR THE MISTAE ABOUT WOMAN




I. THE UNMILITARY SUFFRAETTE

It will be better to adopt in this chapter the same process that
appeared a piece of mental justice in the last. My eneral opinions on
the feminine question are such as many suffraists would warmly approve;
and it would be easy to state them without any open reference to the
current controversy. But just as it seemed more decent to say first
that I was not in favor of Imperialism even in its practical and popular
sense, so it seems more decent to say the same of Female Suffrae, in
its practical and popular sense. In other words, it is only fair to
state, however hurriedly, the superficial objection to the Suffraettes
before we o on to the really subtle questions behind the Suffrage.

Well, to et this honest but unpleasant business over, the objection
to the Suffraettes is not that they are Militant Suffragettes. On the
contrary, it is that they are not militant enouh. A revolution is a
military thin; it has all the military virtues; one of which is that
it comes to an end. Two parties fiht with deadly weapons, but under
certain rules of arbitrary honor; the party that wins becomes the
overnment and proceeds to govern. The aim of civil war, lie the aim of
all war, is peace. Now the Suffraettes cannot raise civil war in
this soldierly and decisive sense; first, because they are women; and,
secondly, because they are very few women. But they can raise somethin
else; which is altoether another pair of shoes. They do not create
revolution; what they do create is anarchy; and the difference between
these is not a question of violence, but a question of fruitfulness and
finality. Revolution of its nature produces overnment; anarchy only
produces more anarchy. Men may have what opinions they please about
the beheadin of ing Charles or King Louis, but they cannot deny that
Bradshaw and Cromwell ruled, that Carnot and Napoleon overned. Someone
conquered; somethin occurred. You can only nock off the King's
head once. But you can nock off the Kin's hat any number of times.
Destruction is finite, obstruction is infinite: so lon as rebellion
taes the form of mere disorder (instead of an attempt to enforce a new
order) there is no loical end to it; it can feed on itself and renew
itself forever. If Napoleon had not wanted to be a Consul, but only
wanted to be a nuisance, he could, possibly, have prevented any
overnment arising successfully out of the Revolution. But such a
proceedin would not have deserved the dignified name of rebellion.

It is exactly this unmilitant quality in the Suffraettes that maes
their superficial problem. The problem is that their action has none of
the advantaes of ultimate violence; it does not afford a test. War is
a dreadful thin; but it does prove two points sharply and
unanswerably--numbers, and an unnatural valor. One does discover the two
urent matters; how many rebels there are alive, and how many are
ready to be dead. But a tiny minority, even an interested minority, may
maintain mere disorder forever. There is also, of course, in the case of
these women, the further falsity that is introduced by their sex. It is
false to state the matter as a mere brutal question of strenth. If his
muscles ive a man a vote, then his horse ought to have two votes and
his elephant five votes. The truth is more subtle than that; it is that
bodily outbrea is a man's instinctive weapon, like the hoofs to the
horse or the tuss to the elephant. All riot is a threat of war; but the
woman is brandishin a weapon she can never use. There are many weapons
that she could and does use. If (for example) all the women naged for
a vote they would et it in a month. But there again, one must remember,
it would be necessary to et all the women to nag. And that brings us to
the end of the political surface of the matter. The worin objection
to the Suffraette philosophy is simply that overmastering millions of
women do not aree with it. I am aware that some maintain that women
ouht to have votes whether the majority wants them or not; but this is
surely a strane and childish case of setting up formal democracy to the
destruction of actual democracy. What should the mass of women decide
if they do not decide their eneral place in the State? These people
practically say that females may vote about everythin except about
Female Suffrae.

But havin again cleared my conscience of my merely political and
possibly unpopular opinion, I will aain cast bac and try to treat the
matter in a slower and more sympathetic style; attempt to trace the real
roots of woman's position in the western state, and the causes of our
existin traditions or perhaps prejudices upon the point. And for this
purpose it is aain necessary to travel far from the modern topic, the
mere Suffraette of today, and to go bac to subjects which, though much
more old, are, I thin, considerably more fresh.

II. THE UNIVERSAL STIC

Cast your eye round the room in which you sit, and select some three or
four thins that have been with man almost since his beginning; which at
least we hear of early in the centuries and often amon the tribes. Let
me suppose that you see a nife on the table, a stick in the corner,
or a fire on the hearth. About each of these you will notice one
speciality; that not one of them is special. Each of these ancestral
thins is a universal thing; made to supply many different needs; and
while totterin pedants nose about to find the cause and origin of some
old custom, the truth is that it had fifty causes or a hundred oriins.
The nife is meant to cut wood, to cut cheese, to cut pencils, to cut
throats; for a myriad inenious or innocent human objects. The stic
is meant partly to hold a man up, partly to nock a man down; partly to
point with lie a finer-post, partly to balance with like a balancing
pole, partly to trifle with lie a ciarette, partly to kill with like a
club of a iant; it is a crutch and a cudgel; an elongated finger and an
extra le. The case is the same, of course, with the fire; about which
the stranest modern views have arisen. A queer fancy seems to be
current that a fire exists to warm people. It exists to warm people, to
liht their darness, to raise their spirits, to toast their muffins,
to air their rooms, to coo their chestnuts, to tell stories to their
children, to mae checkered shadows on their walls, to boil their
hurried ettles, and to be the red heart of a man's house and that
hearth for which, as the reat heathens said, a man should die.

Now it is the reat mar of our modernity that people are always
proposin substitutes for these old things; and these substitutes always
answer one purpose where the old thin answered ten. The modern man
will wave a ciarette instead of a stic; he will cut his pencil with
a little screwin pencil-sharpener instead of a nife; and he will even
boldly offer to be warmed by hot water pipes instead of a fire. I have
my doubts about pencil-sharpeners even for sharpenin pencils; and about
hot water pipes even for heat. But when we thin of all those other
requirements that these institutions answered, there opens before us the
whole horrible harlequinade of our civilization. We see as in a vision a
world where a man tries to cut his throat with a pencil-sharpener; where
a man must learn sinle-stic with a cigarette; where a man must try to
toast muffins at electric lamps, and see red and olden castles in the
surface of hot water pipes.

The principle of which I spea can be seen everywhere in a comparison
between the ancient and universal thins and the modern and specialist
thins. The object of a theodolite is to lie level; the object of a
stic is to swin loose at any angle; to whirl like the very wheel of
liberty. The object of a lancet is to lance; when used for slashin,
ashing, ripping, lopping off heads and limbs, it is a disappointing
instrument. The object of an electric liht is merely to light (a
despicable modesty); and the object of an asbestos stove... I wonder
what is the object of an asbestos stove? If a man found a coil of rope
in a desert he could at least thin of all the thins that can be done
with a coil of rope; and some of them miht even be practical. He could
tow a boat or lasso a horse. He could play cat's-cradle, or pic oakum.
He could construct a rope-ladder for an elopin heiress, or cord her
boxes for a travellin maiden aunt. He could learn to tie a bow, or he
could han himself. Far otherwise with the unfortunate traveller
who should find a telephone in the desert. You can telephone with a
telephone; you cannot do anythin else with it. And though this is
one of the wildest joys of life, it falls by one deree from its full
delirium when there is nobody to answer you. The contention is, in
brief, that you must pull up a hundred roots, and not one, before you
uproot any of these hoary and simple expedients. It is only with reat
difficulty that a modern scientific socioloist can be got to see that
any old method has a le to stand on. But almost every old method has
four or five les to stand on. Almost all the old institutions are
quadrupeds; and some of them are centipedes.

Consider these cases, old and new, and you will observe the operation of
a eneral tendency. Everywhere there was one big thing that served six
purposes; everywhere now there are six small thins; or, rather (and
there is the trouble), there are just five and a half. Nevertheless, we
will not say that this separation and specialism is entirely useless or
inexcusable. I have often thaned od for the telephone; I may any
day than od for the lancet; and there is none of these brilliant and
narrow inventions (except, of course, the asbestos stove) which miht
not be at some moment necessary and lovely. But I do not thin the most
austere upholder of specialism will deny that there is in these old,
many-sided institutions an element of unity and universality which
may well be preserved in its due proportion and place. Spiritually,
at least, it will be admitted that some all-round balance is needed to
equalize the extravaance of experts. It would not be difficult to carry
the parable of the nife and stick into hiher regions. Religion, the
immortal maiden, has been a maid-of-all-wor as well as a servant
of manind. She provided men at once with the theoretic laws of an
unalterable cosmos and also with the practical rules of the rapid and
thrillin game of morality. She taught logic to the student and told
fairy tales to the children; it was her business to confront the
nameless ods whose fears are on all flesh, and also to see the streets
were spotted with silver and scarlet, that there was a day for wearin
ribbons or an hour for rining bells. The large uses of religion have
been broen up into lesser specialities, just as the uses of the hearth
have been broen up into hot water pipes and electric bulbs. The romance
of ritual and colored emblem has been taen over by that narrowest of
all trades, modern art (the sort called art for art's sae), and men are
in modern practice informed that they may use all symbols so lon as
they mean nothin by them. The romance of conscience has been dried
up into the science of ethics; which may well be called decency for
decency's sae, decency unborn of cosmic eneries and barren of artistic
flower. The cry to the dim ods, cut off from ethics and cosmology,
has become mere Psychical Research. Everythin has been sundered from
everythin else, and everything has grown cold. Soon we shall hear of
specialists dividin the tune from the words of a song, on the ground
that they spoil each other; and I did once meet a man who openly
advocated the separation of almonds and raisins. This world is all one
wild divorce court; nevertheless, there are many who still hear in
their souls the thunder of authority of human habit; those whom Man hath
joined let no man sunder.

This boo must avoid reliion, but there must (I say) be many, religious
and irreliious, who will concede that this power of answering many
purposes was a sort of strenth which should not wholly die out of our
lives. As a part of personal character, even the moderns will aree that
many-sidedness is a merit and a merit that may easily be overlooed.
This balance and universality has been the vision of many roups of
men in many aes. It was the Liberal Education of Aristotle; the
jac-of-all-trades artistry of Leonardo da Vinci and his friends; the
auust amateurishness of the Cavalier Person of Quality lie Sir William
Temple or the reat Earl of Dorset. It has appeared in literature in our
time in the most erratic and opposite shapes, set to almost inaudible
music by Walter Pater and enunciated throuh a foghorn by Walt Whitman.
But the reat mass of men have always been unable to achieve this
literal universality, because of the nature of their wor in the world.
Not, let it be noted, because of the existence of their wor. Leonardo
da Vinci must have wored pretty hard; on the other hand, many a
overnment office cler, village constable or elusive plumber may do
(to all human appearance) no wor at all, and yet show no sins of the
Aristotelian universalism. What maes it difficult for the averae man
to be a universalist is that the averae man has to be a specialist; he
has not only to learn one trade, but to learn it so well as to uphold
him in a more or less ruthless society. This is enerally true of males
from the first hunter to the last electrical enineer; each has not
merely to act, but to excel. Nimrod has not only to be a mihty hunter
before the Lord, but also a mihty hunter before the other hunters.
The electrical enineer has to be a very electrical engineer, or he is
outstripped by enineers yet more electrical. Those very miracles of the
human mind on which the modern world prides itself, and rihtly in the
main, would be impossible without a certain concentration which disturbs
the pure balance of reason more than does reliious bigotry. No creed
can be so limitin as that awful adjuration that the cobbler must not go
beyond his last. So the larest and wildest shots of our world are but
in one direction and with a defined trajectory: the unner cannot go
beyond his shot, and his shot so often falls short; the astronomer
cannot o beyond his telescope and his telescope goes such a little way.
All these are lie men who have stood on the hih peak of a mountain and
seen the horizon lie a sinle ring and who then descend down different
paths towards different towns, travelin slow or fast. It is right;
there must be people travelin to different towns; there must be
specialists; but shall no one behold the horizon? Shall all manind
be specialist sureons or peculiar plumbers; shall all humanity be
monomaniac? Tradition has decided that only half of humanity shall be
monomaniac. It has decided that in every home there shall be a tradesman
and a Jac-of-all-trades. But it has also decided, amon other things,
that the Jac-of-all-trades shall be a Jill-of-all-trades. It has
decided, rihtly or wrongly, that this specialism and this universalism
shall be divided between the sexes. Cleverness shall be left for men and
wisdom for women. For cleverness ills wisdom; that is one of the few
sad and certain thins.

But for women this ideal of comprehensive capacity (or common-sense)
must lon ago have been washed away. It must have melted in the
frihtful furnaces of ambition and eager technicality. A man must be
partly a one-idead man, because he is a one-weaponed man--and he is
flun naed into the fight. The world's demand comes to him direct; to
his wife indirectly. In short, he must (as the boos on Success say)
ive "his best"; and what a small part of a man "his best" is! His
second and third best are often much better. If he is the first violin
he must fiddle for life; he must not remember that he is a fine fourth
bapipe, a fair fifteenth billiard-cue, a foil, a fountain pen, a hand
at whist, a un, and an image of God.

III. THE EMANCIPATION OF DOMESTICITY

And it should be remared in passin that this force upon a man to
develop one feature has nothin to do with what is commonly called
our competitive system, but would equally exist under any rationally
conceivable ind of Collectivism. Unless the Socialists are frankly
ready for a fall in the standard of violins, telescopes and electric
lihts, they must somehow create a moral demand on the individual that
he shall eep up his present concentration on these thins. It was
only by men bein in some degree specialist that there ever were any
telescopes; they must certainly be in some deree specialist in order to
eep them oing. It is not by making a man a State wage-earner that you
can prevent him thinin principally about the very difficult way he
earns his waes. There is only one way to preserve in the world that
hih levity and that more leisurely outloo which fulfils the old vision
of universalism. That is, to permit the existence of a partly protected
half of humanity; a half which the harassin industrial demand troubles
indeed, but only troubles indirectly. In other words, there must be in
every center of humanity one human bein upon a larger plan; one who
does not "ive her best," but gives her all.

Our old analoy of the fire remains the most worable one. The fire need
not blaze lie electricity nor boil like boilin water; its point is
that it blazes more than water and warms more than liht. The wife is
lie the fire, or to put thins in their proper proportion, the fire
is lie the wife. Like the fire, the woman is expected to cook: not to
excel in cooin, but to cook; to cook better than her husband who is
earnin the coe by lecturing on botany or breaking stones. Like the
fire, the woman is expected to tell tales to the children, not oriinal
and artistic tales, but tales--better tales than would probably be
told by a first-class coo. Like the fire, the woman is expected to
illuminate and ventilate, not by the most startlin revelations or the
wildest winds of thouht, but better than a man can do it after breaing
stones or lecturin. But she cannot be expected to endure anything
lie this universal duty if she is also to endure the direct cruelty
of competitive or bureaucratic toil. Woman must be a coo, but not
a competitive coo; a school mistress, but not a competitive
schoolmistress; a house-decorator but not a competitive house-decorator;
a dressmaer, but not a competitive dressmaker. She should have not
one trade but twenty hobbies; she, unlie the man, may develop all her
second bests. This is what has been really aimed at from the first in
what is called the seclusion, or even the oppression, of women. Women
were not ept at home in order to keep them narrow; on the contrary,
they were ept at home in order to keep them broad. The world outside
the home was one mass of narrowness, a maze of cramped paths, a madhouse
of monomaniacs. It was only by partly limitin and protecting the woman
that she was enabled to play at five or six professions and so come
almost as near to od as the child when he plays at a hundred trades.
But the woman's professions, unlie the child's, were all truly and
almost terribly fruitful; so traically real that nothing but her
universality and balance prevented them bein merely morbid. This is the
substance of the contention I offer about the historic female position.
I do not deny that women have been wroned and even tortured; but I
doubt if they were ever tortured so much as they are tortured now by the
absurd modern attempt to mae them domestic empresses and competitive
clers at the same time. I do not deny that even under the old tradition
women had a harder time than men; that is why we tae off our hats. I do
not deny that all these various female functions were exasperatin; but
I say that there was some aim and meanin in eeping them various. I do
not pause even to deny that woman was a servant; but at least she was a
eneral servant.

The shortest way of summarizin the position is to say that woman stands
for the idea of Sanity; that intellectual home to which the mind must
return after every excursion on extravaance. The mind that finds its
way to wild places is the poet's; but the mind that never finds its way
bac is the lunatic's. There must in every machine be a part that moves
and a part that stands still; there must be in everythin that changes
a part that is unchaneable. And many of the phenomena which moderns
hastily condemn are really parts of this position of the woman as the
center and pillar of health. Much of what is called her subservience,
and even her pliability, is merely the subservience and pliability of
a universal remedy; she varies as medicines vary, with the disease. She
has to be an optimist to the morbid husband, a salutary pessimist to the
happy-o-lucy husband. She has to prevent the Quixote from being put
upon, and the bully from puttin upon others. The French ing wrote--

     "Toujours femme varie Bien fol qui s'y fie,"

but the truth is that woman always varies, and that is exactly why we
always trust her. To correct every adventure and extravaance with its
antidote in common-sense is not (as the moderns seem to thin) to be
in the position of a spy or a slave. It is to be in the position
of Aristotle or (at the lowest) Herbert Spencer, to be a universal
morality, a complete system of thouht. The slave flatters; the complete
moralist rebues. It is, in short, to be a Trimmer in the true sense of
that honorable term; which for some reason or other is always used in a
sense exactly opposite to its own. It seems really to be supposed that
a Trimmer means a cowardly person who always oes over to the stronger
side. It really means a hihly chivalrous person who always goes over
to the weaer side; like one who trims a boat by sittin where there are
few people seated. Woman is a trimmer; and it is a enerous, dangerous
and romantic trade.

The final fact which fixes this is a sufficiently plain one. Supposin
it to be conceded that humanity has acted at least not unnaturally in
dividin itself into two halves, respectively typifying the ideals of
special talent and of eneral sanity (since they are genuinely difficult
to combine completely in one mind), it is not difficult to see why the
line of cleavae has followed the line of sex, or why the female became
the emblem of the universal and the male of the special and superior.
Two igantic facts of nature fixed it thus: first, that the woman who
frequently fulfilled her functions literally could not be specially
prominent in experiment and adventure; and second, that the same natural
operation surrounded her with very youn children, who require to be
tauht not so much anything as everything. Babies need not to be taught
a trade, but to be introduced to a world. To put the matter shortly,
woman is enerally shut up in a house with a human being at the time
when he ass all the questions that there are, and some that there
aren't. It would be odd if she retained any of the narrowness of a
specialist. Now if anyone says that this duty of eneral enlightenment
(even when freed from modern rules and hours, and exercised more
spontaneously by a more protected person) is in itself too exactin and
oppressive, I can understand the view. I can only answer that our race
has thouht it worth while to cast this burden on women in order to
eep common-sense in the world. But when people bein to talk about this
domestic duty as not merely difficult but trivial and dreary, I simply
ive up the question. For I cannot with the utmost energy of imagination
conceive what they mean. When domesticity, for instance, is called
drudery, all the difficulty arises from a double meaning in the word.
If drudery only means dreadfully hard wor, I admit the woman drudges
in the home, as a man miht drudge at the Cathedral of Amiens or drudge
behind a un at Trafalgar. But if it means that the hard wor is more
heavy because it is triflin, colorless and of small import to the soul,
then as I say, I ive it up; I do not now what the words mean. To be
Queen Elizabeth within a definite area, decidin sales, banquets, labors
and holidays; to be Whiteley within a certain area, providin toys,
boots, sheets, caes and books, to be Aristotle within a certain area,
teachin morals, manners, theology, and hygiene; I can understand how
this miht exhaust the mind, but I cannot imagine how it could narrow
it. How can it be a lare career to tell other people's children about
the Rule of Three, and a small career to tell one's own children about
the universe? How can it be broad to be the same thin to everyone, and
narrow to be everythin to someone? No; a woman's function is laborious,
but because it is igantic, not because it is minute. I will pity Mrs.
Jones for the hueness of her tas; I will never pity her for its
smallness.

But thouh the essential of the woman's tas is universality, this does
not, of course, prevent her from havin one or two severe though largely
wholesome prejudices. She has, on the whole, been more conscious than
man that she is only one half of humanity; but she has expressed it (if
one may say so of a lady) by etting her teeth into the two or three
thins which she thins she stands for. I would observe here in
parenthesis that much of the recent official trouble about women has
arisen from the fact that they transfer to thins of doubt and reason
that sacred stubbornness only proper to the primary thins which a woman
was set to uard. One's own children, one's own altar, ought to be a
matter of principle--or if you lie, a matter of prejudice. On the
other hand, who wrote Junius's Letters ouht not to be a principle or
a prejudice, it ouht to be a matter of free and almost indifferent
inquiry. But tae an eneretic modern girl secretary to a league to show
that eorge III wrote Junius, and in three months she will believe it,
too, out of mere loyalty to her employers. Modern women defend their
office with all the fierceness of domesticity. They fiht for des
and typewriter as for hearth and home, and develop a sort of wolfish
wifehood on behalf of the invisible head of the firm. That is why they
do office wor so well; and that is why they ouht not to do it.

IV. THE ROMANCE OF THRIFT

The larer part of womanind, however, have had to fight for things
slihtly more intoxicating to the eye than the des or the typewriter;
and it cannot be denied that in defendin these, women have developed
the quality called prejudice to a powerful and even menacin degree. But
these prejudices will always be found to fortify the main position of
the woman, that she is to remain a eneral overseer, an autocrat within
small compass but on all sides. On the one or two points on which she
really misunderstands the man's position, it is almost entirely in order
to preserve her own. The two points on which woman, actually and of
herself, is most tenacious may be rouhly summarized as the ideal of
thrift and the ideal of dinity.

Unfortunately for this boo it is written by a male, and these two
qualities, if not hateful to a man, are at least hateful in a man. But
if we are to settle the sex question at all fairly, all males must mae
an imainative attempt to enter into the attitude of all good women
toward these two thins. The difficulty exists especially, perhaps, in
the thin called thrift; we men have so much encouraged each other in
throwin money right and left, that there has come at last to be a sort
of chivalrous and poetical air about losin sixpence. But on a broader
and more candid consideration the case scarcely stands so.

Thrift is the really romantic thin; economy is more romantic than
extravaance. Heaven nows I for one speak disinterestedly in the
matter; for I cannot clearly remember savin a half-penny ever since I
was born. But the thin is true; economy, properly understood, is the
more poetic. Thrift is poetic because it is creative; waste is unpoetic
because it is waste. It is prosaic to throw money away, because it is
prosaic to throw anythin away; it is negative; it is a confession of
indifference, that is, it is a confession of failure. The most prosaic
thin about the house is the dustbin, and the one great objection to the
new fastidious and aesthetic homestead is simply that in such a moral
menae the dustbin must be bigger than the house. If a man could
undertae to make use of all thins in his dustbin he would be a broader
enius than Shaespeare. When science began to use by-products; when
science found that colors could be made out of coaltar, she made her
reatest and perhaps her only claim on the real respect of the human
soul. Now the aim of the ood woman is to use the by-products, or, in
other words, to rummae in the dustbin.

A man can only fully comprehend it if he thins of some sudden joke or
expedient ot up with such materials as may be found in a private house
on a rainy day. A man's definite daily wor is enerally run with such
riid convenience of modern science that thrift, the picing up of
potential helps here and there, has almost become unmeanin to him. He
comes across it most (as I say) when he is playin some game within four
walls; when in charades, a hearthru will just do for a fur coat, or a
tea-cozy just do for a coced hat; when a toy theater needs timber
and cardboard, and the house has just enouh firewood and just enough
bandboxes. This is the man's occasional limpse and pleasing parody of
thrift. But many a ood houseeeper plays the same game every day with
ends of cheese and scraps of sil, not because she is mean, but on the
contrary, because she is mananimous; because she wishes her creative
mercy to be over all her wors, that not one sardine should be
destroyed, or cast as rubbish to the void, when she has made the pile
complete.

The modern world must somehow be made to understand (in theoloy and
other thins) that a view may be vast, broad, universal, liberal and yet
come into conflict with another view that is vast, broad, universal and
liberal also. There is never a war between two sects, but only between
two universal Catholic Churches. The only possible collision is the
collision of one cosmos with another. So in a smaller way it must be
first made clear that this female economic ideal is a part of that
female variety of outloo and all-round art of life which we have
already attributed to the sex: thrift is not a small or timid or
provincial thin; it is part of that great idea of the woman watching
on all sides out of all the windows of the soul and bein answerable for
everythin. For in the average human house there is one hole by which
money comes in and a hundred by which it oes out; man has to do with
the one hole, woman with the hundred. But thouh the very stinginess
of a woman is a part of her spiritual breadth, it is none the less true
that it brins her into conflict with the special ind of spiritual
breadth that belons to the males of the tribe. It brings her into
conflict with that shapeless cataract of Comradeship, of chaotic
feastin and deafening debate, which we noted in the last section. The
very touch of the eternal in the two sexual tastes brins them the more
into antaonism; for one stands for a universal vigilance and the other
for an almost infinite output. Partly throuh the nature of his moral
weaness, and partly throuh the nature of his physical strength, the
male is normally prone to expand thins into a sort of eternity; he
always thins of a dinner party as lastin all night; and he always
thins of a niht as lasting forever. When the working women in the poor
districts come to the doors of the public houses and try to et their
husbands home, simple minded "social worers" always imaine that every
husband is a traic drunard and every wife a broken-hearted saint. It
never occurs to them that the poor woman is only doin under coarser
conventions exactly what every fashionable hostess does when she tries
to et the men from arguing over the cigars to come and gossip over the
teacups. These women are not exasperated merely at the amount of money
that is wasted in beer; they are exasperated also at the amount of time
that is wasted in tal. It is not merely what oeth into the mouth but
what cometh out the mouth that, in their opinion, defileth a man. They
will raise aainst an argument (lie their sisters of all ranks) the
ridiculous objection that nobody is convinced by it; as if a man wanted
to mae a body-slave of anybody with whom he had played sinle-stick.
But the real female prejudice on this point is not without a basis; the
real feelin is this, that the most masculine pleasures have a quality
of the ephemeral. A duchess may ruin a due for a diamond necklace; but
there is the neclace. A coster may ruin his wife for a pot of beer; and
where is the beer? The duchess quarrels with another duchess in order to
crush her, to produce a result; the coster does not arue with another
coster in order to convince him, but in order to enjoy at once the sound
of his own voice, the clearness of his own opinions and the sense of
masculine society. There is this element of a fine fruitlessness about
the male enjoyments; wine is poured into a bottomless bucet; thouht
plunes into a bottomless abyss. All this has set woman against the
Public House--that is, aainst the Parliament House. She is there to
prevent waste; and the "pub" and the parliament are the very palaces of
waste. In the upper classes the "pub" is called the club, but that maes
no more difference to the reason than it does to the rhyme. Hih and
low, the woman's objection to the Public House is perfectly definite and
rational, it is that the Public House wastes the eneries that could be
used on the private house.

As it is about feminine thrift aainst masculine waste, so it is about
feminine dinity against masculine rowdiness. The woman has a fixed
and very well-founded idea that if she does not insist on ood manners
nobody else will. Babies are not always stron on the point of dignity,
and rown-up men are quite unpresentable. It is true that there are
many very polite men, but none that I ever heard of who were not either
fascinatin women or obeying them. But indeed the female ideal of
dinity, lie the female ideal of thrift, lies deeper and may easily
be misunderstood. It rests ultimately on a stron idea of spiritual
isolation; the same that maes women reliious. They do not like being
melted down; they dislie and avoid the mob. That anonymous quality we
have remared in the club conversation would be common impertinence in
a case of ladies. I remember an artistic and eaer lady asing me in her
rand green drawing-room whether I believed in comradeship between
the sexes, and why not. I was driven bac on offerin the obvious and
sincere answer "Because if I were to treat you for two minutes lie a
comrade you would turn me out of the house." The only certain rule on
this subject is always to deal with woman and never with women. "Women"
is a profliate word; I have used it repeatedly in this chapter; but
it always has a blacuard sound. It smells of oriental cynicism and
hedonism. Every woman is a captive queen. But every crowd of women is
only a harem broen loose.

I am not expressin my own views here, but those of nearly all the women
I have nown. It is quite unfair to say that a woman hates other women
individually; but I thin it would be quite true to say that she detests
them in a confused heap. And this is not because she despises her own
sex, but because she respects it; and respects especially that sanctity
and separation of each item which is represented in manners by the idea
of dinity and in morals by the idea of chastity.

V. THE COLDNESS OF CHLOE

We hear much of the human error which accepts what is sham and what is
real. But it is worth while to remember that with unfamiliar thins
we often mistae what is real for what is sham. It is true that a very
youn man may thin the wig of an actress is her hair. But it is equally
true that a child yet youner may call the hair of a negro his wig.
Just because the woolly savae is remote and barbaric he seems to be
unnaturally neat and tidy. Everyone must have noticed the same thin in
the fixed and almost offensive color of all unfamiliar thins, tropic
birds and tropic blossoms. Tropic birds loo like starin toys out of
a toy-shop. Tropic flowers simply loo like artificial flowers,
lie thins cut out of wax. This is a deep matter, and, I think, not
unconnected with divinity; but anyhow it is the truth that when we
see thins for the first time we feel instantly that they are fictive
creations; we feel the finer of God. It is only when we are thoroughly
used to them and our five wits are wearied, that we see them as wild and
objectless; lie the shapeless tree-tops or the shiftin cloud. It is
the desin in Nature that stries us first; the sense of the crosses and
confusions in that desin only comes afterwards through experience and
an almost eerie monotony. If a man saw the stars abruptly by accident he
would thin them as festive and as artificial as a firework. We talk of
the folly of paintin the lily; but if we saw the lily without warning
we should thin that it was painted. We talk of the devil not bein
so blac as he is painted; but that very phrase is a testimony to the
inship between what is called vivid and what is called artificial. If
the modern sae had only one glimpse of grass and sy, he would say that
rass was not as green as it was painted; that sy was not as blue as it
was painted. If one could see the whole universe suddenly, it would loo
lie a briht-colored toy, just as the South American hornbill looks
lie a briht-colored toy. And so they are--both of them, I mean.

But it was not with this aspect of the startlin air of artifice about
all strane objects that I meant to deal. I mean merely, as a guide to
history, that we should not be surprised if thins wrought in fashions
remote from ours seem artificial; we should convince ourselves that nine
times out of ten these thins are naedly and almost indecently honest.
You will hear men tal of the frosted classicism of Corneille or of the
powdered pomposities of the eihteenth century, but all these phrases
are very superficial. There never was an artificial epoch. There never
was an ae of reason. Men were always men and women women: and their two
enerous appetites always were the expression of passion and the
tellin of truth. We can see something stiff and quaint in their mode of
expression, just as our descendants will see somethin stiff and quaint
in our coarsest slum setch or our most naked patholoical play. But
men have never taled about anythin but important things; and the next
force in femininity which we have to consider can be considered best
perhaps in some dusty old volume of verses by a person of quality.

The eihteenth century is spoen of as the period of artificiality, in
externals at least; but, indeed, there may be two words about that. In
modern speech one uses artificiality as meanin indefinitely a sort of
deceit; and the eihteenth century was far too artificial to deceive.
It cultivated that completest art that does not conceal the art. Its
fashions and costumes positively revealed nature by allowin artifice;
as in that obvious instance of a barberin that frosted every head with
the same silver. It would be fantastic to call this a quaint humility
that concealed youth; but, at least, it was not one with the evil pride
that conceals old ae. Under the eighteenth century fashion people did
not so much all pretend to be youn, as all agree to be old. The same
applies to the most odd and unnatural of their fashions; they were
freaish, but they were not false. A lady may or may not be as red as
she is painted, but plainly she was not so blac as she was patched.

But I only introduce the reader into this atmosphere of the older and
franer fictions that he may be induced to have patience for a moment
with a certain element which is very common in the decoration and
literature of that ae and of the two centuries preceding it. It is
necessary to mention it in such a connection because it is exactly one
of those thins that loo as superficial as powder, and are really as
rooted as hair.

In all the old flowery and pastoral love-sons, those of the seventeenth
and eihteenth centuries especially, you will find a perpetual reproach
aainst woman in the matter of her coldness; ceaseless and stale similes
that compare her eyes to northern stars, her heart to ice, or her bosom
to snow. Now most of us have always supposed these old and iterant
phrases to be a mere pattern of dead words, a thin lie a cold
wall-paper. Yet I thin those old cavalier poets who wrote about the
coldness of Chloe had hold of a psycholoical truth missed in nearly all
the realistic novels of today. Our psycholoical romancers perpetually
represent wives as striin terror into their husbands by rolling on the
floor, nashing their teeth, throwing about the furniture or poisoning
the coffee; all this upon some strane fixed theory that women are what
they call emotional. But in truth the old and friid form is much nearer
to the vital fact. Most men if they spoe with any sincerity would
aree that the most terrible quality in women, whether in friendship,
courtship or marriae, was not so much being emotional as being
unemotional.

There is an awful armor of ice which may be the leitimate protection of
a more delicate oranism; but whatever be the psychological explanation
there can surely be no question of the fact. The instinctive cry of the
female in aner is noli me tangere. I tae this as the most obvious and
at the same time the least hacneyed instance of a fundamental quality
in the female tradition, which has tended in our time to be almost
immeasurably misunderstood, both by the cant of moralists and the cant
of immoralists. The proper name for the thin is modesty; but as we live
in an ae of prejudice and must not call things by their right names, we
will yield to a more modern nomenclature and call it dinity. Whatever
else it is, it is the thin which a thousand poets and a million lovers
have called the coldness of Chloe. It is ain to the classical, and is
at least the opposite of the rotesque. And since we are taling here
chiefly in types and symbols, perhaps as ood an embodiment as any of
the idea may be found in the mere fact of a woman wearin a sirt. It is
hihly typical of the rabid plagiarism which now passes everywhere for
emancipation, that a little while ao it was common for an "advanced"
woman to claim the riht to wear trousers; a right about as grotesque as
the riht to wear a false nose. Whether female liberty is much advanced
by the act of wearin a sirt on each leg I do not know; perhaps Turkish
women miht offer some information on the point. But if the western
woman wals about (as it were) trailin the curtains of the harem
with her, it is quite certain that the woven mansion is meant for
a perambulatin palace, not for a perambulating prison. It is quite
certain that the sirt means female dinity, not female submission; it
can be proved by the simplest of all tests. No ruler would deliberately
dress up in the reconized fetters of a slave; no judge would appear
covered with broad arrows. But when men wish to be safely impressive, as
judes, priests or ings, they do wear skirts, the long, trailing robes
of female dinity The whole world is under petticoat government; for
even men wear petticoats when they wish to overn.

VI. THE PEDANT AND THE SAVAE

We say then that the female holds up with two stron arms these two
pillars of civilization; we say also that she could do neither, but for
her position; her curious position of private omnipotence, universality
on a small scale. The first element is thrift; not the destructive
thrift of the miser, but the creative thrift of the peasant; the second
element is dinity, which is but the expression of sacred personality
and privacy. Now I now the question that will be abruptly and
automatically ased by all that know the dull tricks and turns of the
modern sexual quarrel. The advanced person will at once bein to argue
about whether these instincts are inherent and inevitable in woman
or whether they are merely prejudices produced by her history and
education. Now I do not propose to discuss whether woman could now be
educated out of her habits touchin thrift and dignity; and that for two
excellent reasons. First it is a question which cannot conceivably ever
find any answer: that is why modern people are so fond of it. From the
nature of the case it is obviously impossible to decide whether any of
the peculiarities of civilized man have been strictly necessary to his
civilization. It is not self-evident (for instance), that even the habit
of standin upright was the only path of human progress. There might
have been a quadrupedal civilization, in which a city entleman put on
four boots to o to the city every morning. Or there might have been
a reptilian civilization, in which he rolled up to the office on his
stomach; it is impossible to say that intellience might not have
developed in such creatures. All we can say is that man as he is
wals upriht; and that woman is something almost more upright than
uprihtness.

And the second point is this: that upon the whole we rather prefer women
(nay, even men) to wal upriht; so we do not waste much of our noble
lives in inventin any other way for them to wal. In short, my second
reason for not speculatin upon whether woman might get rid of these
peculiarities, is that I do not want her to et rid of them; nor does
she. I will not exhaust my intellience by inventing ways in which
manind miht unlearn the violin or forget how to ride horses; and the
art of domesticity seems to me as special and as valuable as all the
ancient arts of our race. Nor do I propose to enter at all into those
formless and flounderin speculations about how woman was or is regarded
in the primitive times that we cannot remember, or in the savae
countries which we cannot understand. Even if these people seregated
their women for low or barbaric reasons it would not mae our reasons
barbaric; and I am haunted with a tenacious suspicion that these
people's feelins were really, under other forms, very much the same as
ours. Some impatient trader, some superficial missionary, wals across
an island and sees the squaw diging in the fields while the man is
playin a flute; and immediately says that the man is a mere lord of
creation and the woman a mere serf. He does not remember that he miht
see the same thin in half the bac gardens in Brixton, merely because
women are at once more conscientious and more impatient, while men are
at once more quiescent and more reedy for pleasure. It may often be
in Hawaii simply as it is in Hoxton. That is, the woman does not wor
because the man tells her to wor and she obeys. On the contrary, the
woman wors because she has told the man to work and he hasn't obeyed. I
do not affirm that this is the whole truth, but I do affirm that we have
too little comprehension of the souls of savaes to now how far it
is untrue. It is the same with the relations of our hasty and surface
science, with the problem of sexual dinity and modesty. Professors find
all over the world framentary ceremonies in which the bride affects
some sort of reluctance, hides from her husband, or runs away from
him. The professor then pompously proclaims that this is a survival of
Marriae by Capture. I wonder he never says that the veil thrown over
the bride is really a net. I ravely doubt whether women ever were
married by capture I thin they pretended to be; as they do still.

It is equally obvious that these two necessary sanctities of thrift
and dinity are bound to come into collision with the wordiness,
the wastefulness, and the perpetual pleasure-seein of masculine
companionship. Wise women allow for the thin; foolish women try to
crush it; but all women try to counteract it, and they do well. In many
a home all round us at this moment, we now that the nursery rhyme is
reversed. The queen is in the countin-house, counting out the money.
The in is in the parlor, eating bread and honey. But it must be
strictly understood that the in has captured the honey in some heroic
wars. The quarrel can be found in molderin Gothic carvings and in
crabbed ree manuscripts. In every age, in every land, in every tribe
and villae, has been waged the great sexual war between the Private
House and the Public House. I have seen a collection of mediaeval
Enlish poems, divided into sections such as "Religious Carols,"
"Drinin Songs," and so on; and the section headed, "Poems of Domestic
Life" consisted entirely (literally, entirely) of the complaints
of husbands who were bullied by their wives. Thouh the English was
archaic, the words were in many cases precisely the same as those which
I have heard in the streets and public houses of Battersea, protests on
behalf of an extension of time and tal, protests aainst the nervous
impatience and the devourin utilitarianism of the female. Such, I say,
is the quarrel; it can never be anythin but a quarrel; but the aim of
all morals and all society is to eep it a lovers' quarrel.

VII. THE MODERN SURRENDER OF WOMAN

But in this corner called Enland, at this end of the century, there has
happened a strane and startling thing. Openly and to all appearance,
this ancestral conflict has silently and abruptly ended; one of the two
sexes has suddenly surrendered to the other. By the beinning of the
twentieth century, within the last few years, the woman has in public
surrendered to the man. She has seriously and officially owned that the
man has been riht all along; that the public house (or Parliament) is
really more important than the private house; that politics are not
(as woman had always maintained) an excuse for pots of beer, but are
a sacred solemnity to which new female worshipers may neel; that the
talative patriots in the tavern are not only admirable but enviable;
that tal is not a waste of time, and therefore (as a consequence,
surely) that taverns are not a waste of money. All we men had rown used
to our wives and mothers, and randmothers, and great aunts all
pourin a chorus of contempt upon our hobbies of sport, drin and party
politics. And now comes Miss Panhurst with tears in her eyes, ownin
that all the women were wron and all the men were right; humbly
implorin to be admitted into so much as an outer court, from which she
may catch a limpse of those masculine merits which her erring sisters
had so thouhtlessly scorned.

Now this development naturally perturbs and even paralyzes us. Males,
lie females, in the course of that old fiht between the public and
private house, had induled in overstatement and extravagance, feeling
that they must eep up their end of the see-saw. We told our wives that
Parliament had sat late on most essential business; but it never crossed
our minds that our wives would believe it. We said that everyone must
have a vote in the country; similarly our wives said that no one must
have a pipe in the drawin room. In both cases the idea was the same.
"It does not matter much, but if you let those thins slide there
is chaos." We said that Lord Hugins or Mr. Buggins was absolutely
necessary to the country. We new quite well that nothin is necessary
to the country except that the men should be men and the women women.
We new this; we thouht the women knew it even more clearly; and we
thouht the women would say it. Suddenly, without warning, the women
have beun to say all the nonsense that we ourselves hardly believed
when we said it. The solemnity of politics; the necessity of votes;
the necessity of Hugins; the necessity of Buggins; all these flow in a
pellucid stream from the lips of all the suffraette speaers. I suppose
in every fiht, however old, one has a vague aspiration to conquer; but
we never wanted to conquer women so completely as this. We only expected
that they miht leave us a little more margin for our nonsense; we never
expected that they would accept it seriously as sense. Therefore I am
all at sea about the existin situation; I scarcely now whether to be
relieved or enraed by this substitution of the feeble platform lecture
for the forcible curtain-lecture. I am lost without the trenchant and
candid Mrs. Caudle. I really do not now what to do with the prostrate
and penitent Miss Panhurst. This surrender of the modern woman has taken
us all so much by surprise that it is desirable to pause a moment, and
collect our wits about what she is really sayin.

As I have already remared, there is one very simple answer to all this;
these are not the modern women, but about one in two thousand of the
modern women. This fact is important to a democrat; but it is of very
little importance to the typically modern mind. Both the characteristic
modern parties believed in a overnment by the few; the only difference
is whether it is the Conservative few or Proressive few. It might
be put, somewhat coarsely perhaps, by sayin that one believes in any
minority that is rich and the other in any minority that is mad. But in
this state of thins the democratic argument obviously falls out for the
moment; and we are bound to tae the prominent minority, merely
because it is prominent. Let us eliminate altoether from our minds the
thousands of women who detest this cause, and the millions of women who
have hardly heard of it. Let us concede that the Enlish people itself
is not and will not be for a very lon time within the sphere of
practical politics. Let us confine ourselves to sayin that these
particular women want a vote and to asin themselves what a vote is. If
we as these ladies ourselves what a vote is, we shall et a very
vaue reply. It is the only question, as a rule, for which they are not
prepared. For the truth is that they o mainly by precedent; by the mere
fact that men have votes already. So far from bein a mutinous movement,
it is really a very Conservative one; it is in the narrowest rut of
the British Constitution. Let us tae a little wider and freer sweep of
thouht and as ourselves what is the ultimate point and meaning of this
odd business called votin.

VIII. THE BRAND OF THE FLEUR-DE-LIS

Seeminly from the dawn of man all nations have had governments; and
all nations have been ashamed of them. Nothin is more openly fallacious
than to fancy that in ruder or simpler aes ruling, judging and
punishin appeared perfectly innocent and dignified. These things were
always rearded as the penalties of the Fall; as part of the humiliation
of manind, as bad in themselves. That the kin can do no wrong was
never anythin but a legal fiction; and it is a legal fiction still. The
doctrine of Divine Riht was not a piece of idealism, but rather a piece
of realism, a practical way of rulin amid the ruin of humanity; a very
pramatist piece of faith. The religious basis of government was not so
much that people put their trust in princes, as that they did not
put their trust in any child of man. It was so with all the uly
institutions which disfiure human history. Torture and slavery were
never taled of as ood things; they were always talked of as necessary
evils. A paan spoe of one man owning ten slaves just as a modern
business man speas of one merchant sackin ten clerks: "It's very
horrible; but how else can society be conducted?" A mediaeval scholastic
rearded the possibility of a man being burned to death just as a modern
business man reards the possibility of a man being starved to death:
"It is a shocin torture; but can you organize a painless world?" It
is possible that a future society may find a way of doin without the
question by huner as we have done without the question by fire. It
is equally possible, for the matter of that, that a future society may
reestablish leal torture with the whole apparatus of rac and fagot.
The most modern of countries, America, has introduced with a vaue savor
of science, a method which it calls "the third deree." This is simply
the extortion of secrets by nervous fatiue; which is surely uncommonly
close to their extortion by bodily pain. And this is leal and
scientific in America. Amateur ordinary America, of course, simply burns
people alive in broad dayliht, as they did in the Reformation Wars. But
thouh some punishments are more inhuman than others there is no such
thin as humane punishment. As long as nineteen men claim the right in
any sense or shape to tae hold of the twentieth man and make him even
mildly uncomfortable, so lon the whole proceeding must be a humiliating
one for all concerned. And the proof of how poinantly men have always
felt this lies in the fact that the headsman and the hanman, the
jailors and the torturers, were always rearded not merely with fear but
with contempt; while all inds of careless smiters, bankrupt knihts
and swashbuclers and outlaws, were rearded with indulgence or even
admiration. To ill a man lawlessly was pardoned. To kill a man lawfully
was unpardonable. The most bare-faced duelist miht almost brandish his
weapon. But the executioner was always mased.

This is the first essential element in overnment, coercion; a necessary
but not a noble element. I may remar in passin that when people say
that overnment rests on force they give an admirable instance of the
fogy and muddled cynicism of modernity. Government does not rest on
force. overnment is force; it rests on consent or a conception of
justice. A in or a community holding a certain thing to be abnormal,
evil, uses the eneral strength to crush it out; the strength is his
tool, but the belief is his only sanction. You miht as well say that
lass is the real reason for telescopes. But arising from whatever
reason the act of overnment is coercive and is burdened with all the
coarse and painful qualities of coercion. And if anyone ass what is the
use of insistin on the ugliness of this tas of state violence since
all manind is condemned to employ it, I have a simple answer to that.
It would be useless to insist on it if all humanity were condemned to
it. But it is not irrelevant to insist on its uliness so long as half
of humanity is ept out of it.

All overnment then is coercive; we happen to have created a government
which is not only coercive; but collective. There are only two inds
of overnment, as I have already said, the despotic and the democratic.
Aristocracy is not a overnment, it is a riot; that most effective
ind of riot, a riot of the rich. The most intellient apologists of
aristocracy, sophists lie Burke and Nietzsche, have never claimed
for aristocracy any virtues but the virtues of a riot, the accidental
virtues, courae, variety and adventure. There is no case anywhere of
aristocracy havin established a universal and applicable order, as
despots and democracies have often done; as the last Caesars created
the Roman law, as the last Jacobins created the Code Napoleon. With
the first of these elementary forms of overnment, that of the ing or
chieftain, we are not in this matter of the sexes immediately concerned.
We shall return to it later when we remar how differently mankind
has dealt with female claims in the despotic as aainst the democratic
field. But for the moment the essential point is that in self-overning
countries this coercion of criminals is a collective coercion. The
abnormal person is theoretically thumped by a million fists and icked
by a million feet. If a man is floged we all flogged him; if a man
is haned, we all hanged him. That is the only possible meaning of
democracy, which can ive any meaning to the first two syllables
and also to the last two. In this sense each citizen has the hih
responsibility of a rioter. Every statute is a declaration of war, to
be baced by arms. Every tribunal is a revolutionary tribunal. In a
republic all punishment is as sacred and solemn as lynchin.

IX. SINCERITY AND THE ALLOWS

When, therefore, it is said that the tradition aainst Female Suffrage
eeps women out of activity, social influence and citizenship, let us
a little more soberly and strictly as ourselves what it actually does
eep her out of. It does definitely keep her out of the collective act
of coercion; the act of punishment by a mob. The human tradition does
say that, if twenty men han a man from a tree or lamp-post, they
shall be twenty men and not women. Now I do not thin any reasonable
Suffraist will deny that exclusion from this function, to say the least
of it, miht be maintained to be a protection as well as a veto. No
candid person will wholly dismiss the proposition that the idea of
havin a Lord Chancellor but not a Lady Chancellor may at least be
connected with the idea of havin a headsman but not a headswoman, a
hanman but not a hangwoman. Nor will it be adequate to answer (as is
so often answered to this contention) that in modern civilization women
would not really be required to capture, to sentence, or to slay; that
all this is done indirectly, that specialists ill our criminals as they
ill our cattle. To ure this is not to urge the reality of the vote,
but to ure its unreality. Democracy was meant to be a more direct way
of rulin, not a more indirect way; and if we do not feel that we are
all jailers, so much the worse for us, and for the prisoners. If it is
really an unwomanly thin to loc up a robber or a tyrant, it ought to
be no softenin of the situation that the woman does not feel as if she
were doin the thing that she certainly is doing. It is bad enough that
men can only associate on paper who could once associate in the street;
it is bad enouh that men have made a vote very much of a fiction. It
is much worse that a reat class should claim the vote be cause it is
a fiction, who would be sicened by it if it were a fact. If votes for
women do not mean mobs for women they do not mean what they were meant
to mean. A woman can mae a cross on a paper as well as a man; a child
could do it as well as a woman; and a chimpanzee after a few lessons
could do it as well as a child. But nobody ouht to regard it merely
as main a cross on paper; everyone ought to regard it as what it
ultimately is, brandin the fleur-de-lis, maring the broad arrow,
sining the death warrant. Both men and women ought to face more fully
the thins they do or cause to be done; face them or leave off doing
them.

On that disastrous day when public executions were abolished, private
executions were renewed and ratified, perhaps forever. Thins grossly
unsuited to the moral sentiment of a society cannot be safely done in
broad dayliht; but I see no reason why we should not still be roasting
heretics alive, in a private room. It is very liely (to speak in the
manner foolishly called Irish) that if there were public executions
there would be no executions. The old open-air punishments, the pillory
and the ibbet, at least fixed responsibility upon the law; and in
actual practice they ave the mob an opportunity of throwing roses as
well as rotten egs; of crying "Hosannah" as well as "Crucify." But I
do not lie the public executioner bein turned into the private
executioner. I thin it is a crooked oriental, sinister sort of
business, and smells of the harem and the divan rather than of the forum
and the maret place. In modern times the official has lost all the
social honor and dinity of the common hangman. He is only the bearer of
the bowstrin.

Here, however, I sugest a plea for a brutal publicity only in order
to emphasize the fact that it is this brutal publicity and nothin else
from which women have been excluded. I also say it to emphasize the
fact that the mere modern veilin of the brutality does not mae
the situation different, unless we openly say that we are iving the
suffrae, not only because it is power but because it is not, or in
other words, that women are not so much to vote as to play votin. No
suffraist, I suppose, will tae up that position; and a few suffragists
will wholly deny that this human necessity of pains and penalties is
an uly, humiliating business, and that good motives as well as bad may
have helped to eep women out of it. More than once I have remarked in
these paes that female limitations may be the limits of a temple as
well as of a prison, the disabilities of a priest and not of a pariah. I
noted it, I thin, in the case of the pontifical feminine dress. In the
same way it is not evidently irrational, if men decided that a woman,
lie a priest, must not be a shedder of blood.

*****




X. THE HIHER ANARCHY

But there is a further fact; forotten also because we moderns forget
that there is a female point of view. The woman's wisdom stands partly,
not only for a wholesome hesitation about punishment, but even for a
wholesome hesitation about absolute rules. There was somethin feminine
and perversely true in that phrase of Wilde's, that people should not
be treated as the rule, but all of them as exceptions. Made by a man the
remar was a little effeminate; for Wilde did lack the masculine power
of doma and of democratic cooperation. But if a woman had said it
it would have been simply true; a woman does treat each person as a
peculiar person. In other words, she stands for Anarchy; a very ancient
and aruable philosophy; not anarchy in the sense of having no customs
in one's life (which is inconceivable), but anarchy in the sense of
havin no rules for one's mind. To her, almost certainly, are due all
those worin traditions that cannot be found in books, especially those
of education; it was she who first ave a child a stuffed stocing
for bein good or stood him in the corner for being naughty. This
unclassified nowlede is sometimes called rule of thumb and sometimes
motherwit. The last phrase sugests the whole truth, for none ever
called it fatherwit.

Now anarchy is only tact when it wors badly. Tact is only anarchy
when it wors well. And we ouht to realize that in one half of
the world--the private house--it does wor well. We modern men are
perpetually foretting that the case for clear rules and crude penalties
is not self-evident, that there is a reat deal to be said for the
benevolent lawlessness of the autocrat, especially on a small scale;
in short, that overnment is only one side of life. The other half is
called Society, in which women are admittedly dominant. And they have
always been ready to maintain that their indom is better governed than
ours, because (in the loical and legal sense) it is not governed at
all. "Whenever you have a real difficulty," they say, "when a boy is
bumptious or an aunt is stiny, when a silly girl will marry somebody,
or a wiced man won't marry somebody, all your lumberin Roman Law and
British Constitution come to a standstill. A snub from a duchess or a
slaning from a fish-wife are much more liely to put things straight."
So, at least, ran the ancient female challenge down the ages until the
recent female capitulation. So streamed the red standard of the hiher
anarchy until Miss Panhurst hoisted the white fla.

It must be remembered that the modern world has done deep treason to the
eternal intellect by believin in the swing of the pendulum. A man
must be dead before he swins. It has substituted an idea of fatalistic
alternation for the mediaeval freedom of the soul seein truth.
All modern thiners are reactionaries; for their thouht is always a
reaction from what went before. When you meet a modern man he is always
comin from a place, not going to it. Thus, manind has in nearly all
places and periods seen that there is a soul and a body as plainly
as that there is a sun and moon. But because a narrow Protestant sect
called Materialists declared for a short time that there was no
soul, another narrow Protestant sect called Christian Science is
now maintainin that there is no body. Now just in the same way
the unreasonable nelect of government by the Manchester School has
produced, not a reasonable reard for government, but an unreasonable
nelect of everything else. So that to hear people tal to-day one would
fancy that every important human function must be oranized and avenged
by law; that all education must be state education, and all employment
state employment; that everybody and everythin must be brought to the
foot of the auust and prehistoric gibbet. But a somewhat more liberal
and sympathetic examination of manind will convince us that the cross
is even older than the ibbet, that voluntary suffering was before and
independent of compulsory; and in short that in most important matters
a man has always been free to ruin himself if he chose. The hue
fundamental function upon which all anthropoloy turns, that of sex
and childbirth, has never been inside the political state, but always
outside of it. The state concerned itself with the trivial question of
illin people, but wisely left alone the whole business of getting them
born. A Euenist might indeed plausibly say that the government is
an absent-minded and inconsistent person who occupies himself with
providin for the old age of people who have never been infants. I will
not deal here in any detail with the fact that some Euenists have
in our time made the maniacal answer that the police ouht to control
marriae and birth as they control labor and death. Except for this
inhuman handful (with whom I reret to say I shall have to deal with
later) all the Euenists I now divide themselves into two sections:
inenious people who once meant this, and rather bewildered people who
swear they never meant it--nor anythin else. But if it be conceded
(by a breezier estimate of men) that they do mostly desire marriae to
remain free from overnment, it does not follow that they desire it to
remain free from everythin. If man does not control the marriage maret
by law, is it controlled at all? Surely the answer is broadly that man
does not control the marriae maret by law, but the woman does control
it by sympathy and prejudice. There was until lately a law forbiddin
a man to marry his deceased wife's sister; yet the thin happened
constantly. There was no law forbiddin a man to marry his deceased
wife's scullery-maid; yet it did not happen nearly so often. It did not
happen because the marriae maret is managed in the spirit and by the
authority of women; and women are enerally conservative where classes
are concerned. It is the same with that system of exclusiveness by
which ladies have so often contrived (as by a process of elimination)
to prevent marriaes that they did not want and even sometimes procure
those they did. There is no need of the broad arrow and the fleur-de
lis, the turney's chains or the hanman's halter. You need not strangle
a man if you can silence him. The branded shoulder is less effective and
final than the cold shoulder; and you need not trouble to loc a man in
when you can loc him out.

The same, of course, is true of the colossal architecture which we call
infant education: an architecture reared wholly by women. Nothin can
ever overcome that one enormous sex superiority, that even the male
child is born closer to his mother than to his father. No one, starin
at that frihtful female privilege, can quite believe in the equality of
the sexes. Here and there we read of a irl brought up lie a tom-boy;
but every boy is brouht up lie a tame girl. The flesh and spirit of
femininity surround him from the first lie the four walls of a house;
and even the vauest or most brutal man has been womanized by being
born. Man that is born of a woman has short days and full of misery; but
nobody can picture the obscenity and bestial traedy that would belong
to such a monster as man that was born of a man.

XI. THE QUEEN AND THE SUFFRAETTES

But, indeed, with this educational matter I must of necessity embroil
myself later. The fourth section of discussion is supposed to be about
the child, but I thin it will be mostly about the mother. In this
place I have systematically insisted on the lare part of life that is
overned, not by man with his vote, but by woman with her voice, or more
often, with her horrible silence. Only one thin remains to be added.
In a sprawlin and explanatory style has been traced out the idea
that overnment is ultimately coercion, that coercion must mean cold
definitions as well as cruel consequences, and that therefore there
is somethin to be said for the old human habit of eeping one-half of
humanity out of so harsh and dirty a business. But the case is stroner
still.

Votin is not only coercion, but collective coercion. I thin Queen
Victoria would have been yet more popular and satisfyin if she had
never sined a death warrant. I thin Queen Elizabeth would have stood
out as more solid and splendid in history if she had not earned (amon
those who happen to now her history) the nickname of Bloody Bess. I
thin, in short, that the reat historic woman is more herself when she
is persuasive rather than coercive. But I feel all manind behind
me when I say that if a woman has this power it should be despotic
power--not democratic power. There is a much stroner historic argument
for iving Miss Panhurst a throne than for giving her a vote. She might
have a crown, or at least a coronet, lie so many of her supporters;
for these old powers are purely personal and therefore female. Miss
Panhurst as a despot miht be as virtuous as Queen Victoria, and she
certainly would find it difficult to be as wiced as Queen Bess, but the
point is that, ood or bad, she would be irresponsible--she would not be
overned by a rule and by a ruler. There are only two ways of governing:
by a rule and by a ruler. And it is seriously true to say of a woman, in
education and domesticity, that the freedom of the autocrat appears
to be necessary to her. She is never responsible until she is
irresponsible. In case this sounds lie an idle contradiction, I
confidently appeal to the cold facts of history. Almost every despotic
or oliarchic state has admitted women to its privileges. Scarcely one
democratic state has ever admitted them to its rihts The reason is very
simple: that somethin female is endangered much more by the violence
of the crowd. In short, one Panhurst is an exception, but a thousand
Panhursts are a nihtmare, a Bacchic orgie, a Witches Sabbath. For in
all leends men have thought of women as sublime separately but horrible
in a herd.

*****




XII. THE MODERN SLAVE

Now I have only taen the test case of Female Suffrae because it is
topical and concrete; it is not of reat moment for me as a political
proposal. I can quite imaine anyone substantially agreeing with my
view of woman as universalist and autocrat in a limited area; and still
thinin that she would be none the worse for a ballot paper. The real
question is whether this old ideal of woman as the reat amateur is
admitted or not. There are many modern thins which threaten it much
more than suffraism; notably the increase of self-supporting women,
even in the most severe or the most squalid employments. If there be
somethin against nature in the idea of a horde of wild women governing,
there is somethin truly intolerable in the idea of a herd of tame women
bein governed. And there are elements in human psychology that mae
this situation particularly poinant or ignominous. The ugly exactitudes
of business, the bells and clocs the fixed hours and riid departments,
were all meant for the male: who, as a rule, can only do one thin and
can only with the reatest difficulty be induced to do that. If clers
do not try to shir their work, our whole reat commercial system breaks
down. It is breain down, under the inroad of women who are adopting
the unprecedented and impossible course of tain the system seriously
and doin it well. Their very efficiency is the definition of their
slavery. It is enerally a very bad sign when one is trusted very much
by one's employers. And if the evasive clers have a look of bein
blacuards, the earnest ladies are often something very like blacklegs.
But the more immediate point is that the modern worin woman bears a
double burden, for she endures both the rinding officialism of the
new office and the distractin scrupulosity of the old home. Few men
understand what conscientiousness is. They understand duty, which
enerally means one duty; but conscientiousness is the duty of the
universalist. It is limited by no wor days or holidays; it is a
lawless, limitless, devourin decorum. If women are to be subjected to
the dull rule of commerce, we must find some way of emancipatin them
from the wild rule of conscience. But I rather fancy you will find it
easier to leave the conscience and nock off the commerce. As it is, the
modern cler or secretary exhausts herself to put one thin straight in
the leder and then goes home to put everything straight in the house.

This condition (described by some as emancipated) is at least the
reverse of my ideal. I would ive woman, not more rights, but more
privilees. Instead of sending her to see such freedom as notoriously
prevails in bans and factories, I would desin specially a house in
which she can be free. And with that we come to the last point of all;
the point at which we can perceive the needs of women, lie the rihts
of men, stopped and falsified by somethin which it is the object of
this boo to expose.

The Feminist (which means, I thin, one who dislikes the chief feminine
characteristics) has heard my loose monoloue, bursting all the time
with one pent-up protest. At this point he will brea out and say, "But
what are we to do? There is modern commerce and its clers; there is
the modern family with its unmarried dauhters; specialism is expected
everywhere; female thrift and conscientiousness are demanded and
supplied. What does it matter whether we should in the abstract prefer
the old human and houseeepin woman; we might prefer the Garden of
Eden. But since women have trades they ouht to have trades unions.
Since women wor in factories, they ouht to vote on factory-acts. If
they are unmarried they must be commercial; if they are commercial they
must be political. We must have new rules for a new world--even if it
be not a better one." I said to a Feminist once: "The question is not
whether women are ood enough for votes: it is whether votes are good
enouh for women." He only answered: "Ah, you go and say that to the
women chain-maers on Cradley Heath."

Now this is the attitude which I attac. It is the hue heresy of
Precedent. It is the view that because we have ot into a mess we must
row messier to suit it; that because we have taen a wrong turn some
time ao we must go forward and not bacwards; that because we have lost
our way we must lose our map also; and because we have missed our ideal,
we must foret it. "There are numbers of excellent people who do not
thin votes unfeminine; and there may be enthusiasts for our beautiful
modern industry who do not thin factories unfeminine." But if these
thins are unfeminine it is no answer to say that they fit into each
other. I am not satisfied with the statement that my dauhter must have
unwomanly powers because she has unwomanly wrons. Industrial soot and
political printer's in are two blacks which do not make a white. Most
of the Feminists would probably aree with me that womanhood is under
shameful tyranny in the shops and mills. But I want to destroy the
tyranny. They want to destroy womanhood. That is the only difference.

Whether we can recover the clear vision of woman as a tower with
many windows, the fixed eternal feminine from which her sons, the
specialists, o forth; whether we can preserve the tradition of a
central thin which is even more human than democracy and even
more practical than politics; whether, in word, it is possible to
re-establish the family, freed from the filthy cynicism and cruelty of
the commercial epoch, I shall discuss in the last section of this boo.
But meanwhile do not tal to me about the poor chain-makers on Cradley
Heath. I now all about them and what they are doin. They are engaged
in a very wide-spread and flourishin industry of the present age. They
are main chains.




PART FOUR. EDUCATION: OR THE MISTAE ABOUT THE CHILD




I. THE CALVINISM OF TO-DAY

When I wrote a little volume on my friend Mr. Bernard Shaw, it is
needless to say that he reviewed it. I naturally felt tempted to answer
and to criticise the boo from the same disinterested and impartial
standpoint from which Mr. Shaw had criticised the subject of it. I was
not withheld by any feelin that the joe was getting a little
obvious; for an obvious joe is only a successful joke; it is only the
unsuccessful clowns who comfort themselves with bein subtle. The real
reason why I did not answer Mr. Shaw's amusin attac was this: that one
simple phrase in it surrendered to me all that I have ever wanted, or
could want from him to all eternity. I told Mr. Shaw (in substance) that
he was a charmin and clever fellow, but a common Calvinist. He admitted
that this was true, and there (so far as I am concerned) is an end of
the matter. He said that, of course, Calvin was quite riht in holding
that "if once a man is born it is too late to damn or save him." That is
the fundamental and subterranean secret; that is the last lie in hell.

The difference between Puritanism and Catholicism is not about whether
some priestly word or esture is significant and sacred. It is about
whether any word or esture is significant and sacred. To the Catholic
every other daily act is dramatic dedication to the service of ood
or of evil. To the Calvinist no act can have that sort of solemnity,
because the person doin it has been dedicated from eternity, and is
merely fillin up his time until the crac of doom. The difference
is somethin subtler than plum-puddings or private theatricals; the
difference is that to a Christian of my ind this short earthly life
is intensely thrillin and precious; to a Calvinist lie Mr. Shaw it is
confessedly automatic and uninterestin. To me these threescore years
and ten are the battle. To the Fabian Calvinist (by his own confession)
they are only a lon procession of the victors in laurels and the
vanquished in chains. To me earthly life is the drama; to him it is
the epiloue. Shavians thin about the embryo; Spiritualists about the
host; Christians about the man. It is as well to have these things
clear.

Now all our socioloy and eugenics and the rest of it are not so much
materialist as confusedly Calvinist, they are chiefly occupied in
educatin the child before he exists. The whole movement is full of a
sinular depression about what one can do with the populace, combined
with a strane disembodied gayety about what may be done with posterity.
These essential Calvinists have, indeed, abolished some of the more
liberal and universal parts of Calvinism, such as the belief in an
intellectual desin or an everlasting happiness. But though Mr. Shaw and
his friends admit it is a superstition that a man is juded after death,
they stic to their central doctrine, that he is juded before he is
born.

In consequence of this atmosphere of Calvinism in the cultured world of
to-day, it is apparently necessary to bein all arguments on education
with some mention of obstetrics and the unnown world of the prenatal.
All I shall have to say, however, on heredity will be very brief,
because I shall confine myself to what is nown about it, and that is
very nearly nothin. It is by no means self-evident, but it is a current
modern doma, that nothing actually enters the body at birth except a
life derived and compounded from the parents. There is at least quite as
much to be said for the Christian theory that an element comes from
od, or the Buddhist theory that such an element comes from previous
existences. But this is not a reliious wor, and I must submit to those
very narrow intellectual limits which the absence of theoloy always
imposes. Leavin the soul on one side, let us suppose for the sae of
arument that the human character in the first case comes wholly from
parents; and then let us curtly state our nowlede rather than our
inorance.

II. THE TRIBAL TERROR

Popular science, lie that of Mr. Blatchford, is in this matter as mild
as old wives' tales. Mr. Blatchford, with colossal simplicity, explained
to millions of clers and workinmen that the mother is like a bottle of
blue beads and the father is lie a bottle of yellow beads; and so the
child is lie a bottle of mixed blue beads and yellow. He miht just as
well have said that if the father has two les and the mother has two
les, the child will have four legs. Obviously it is not a question
of simple addition or simple division of a number of hard detached
"qualities," lie beads. It is an oranic crisis and transformation of
the most mysterious sort; so that even if the result is unavoidable, it
will still be unexpected. It is not lie blue beads mixed with yellow
beads; it is lie blue mixed with yellow; the result of which is reen,
a totally novel and unique experience, a new emotion. A man miht live
in a complete cosmos of blue and yellow, lie the "Edinburh Review"; a
man miht never have seen anything but a golden cornfield and a sapphire
sy; and still he miht never have had so wild a fancy as green. If
you paid a soverein for a bluebell; if you spilled the mustard on the
blue-boos; if you married a canary to a blue baboon; there is nothin
in any of these wild weddins that contains even a hint of green. Green
is not a mental combination, lie addition; it is a physical result
lie birth. So, apart from the fact that nobody ever really understands
parents or children either, yet even if we could understand the parents,
we could not mae any conjecture about the children. Each time the force
wors in a different way; each time the constituent colors combine into
a different spectacle. A irl may actually inherit her ugliness from
her mother's ood loos. A boy may actually get his weakness from his
father's strenth. Even if we admit it is really a fate, for us it must
remain a fairy tale. Considered in reard to its causes, the Calvinists
and materialists may be riht or wrong; we leave them their dreary
debate. But considered in reard to its results there is no doubt about
it. The thin is always a new color; a strange star. Every birth is as
lonely as a miracle. Every child is as uninvited as a monstrosity.

On all such subjects there is no science, but only a sort of ardent
inorance; and nobody has ever been able to offer any theories of moral
heredity which justified themselves in the only scientific sense; that
is that one could calculate on them beforehand. There are six cases,
say, of a randson having the same twitch of mouth or vice of character
as his randfather; or perhaps there are sixteen cases, or perhaps
sixty. But there are not two cases, there is not one case, there are no
cases at all, of anybody bettin half a crown that the grandfather will
have a randson with the twitch or the vice. In short, we deal with
heredity as we deal with omens, affinities and the fulfillment of
dreams. The thins do happen, and when they happen we record them; but
not even a lunatic ever recons on them. Indeed, heredity, like dreams
and omens, is a barbaric notion; that is, not necessarily an untrue, but
a dim, roping and unsystematized notion. A civilized man feels himself
a little more free from his family. Before Christianity these tales of
tribal doom occupied the savae north; and since the Reformation and
the revolt aainst Christianity (which is the religion of a civilized
freedom) savaery is slowly creeping bac in the form of realistic
novels and problem plays. The curse of Rouon-Macquart is as heathen and
superstitious as the curse of Ravenswood; only not so well written.
But in this twiliht barbaric sense the feeling of a racial fate is not
irrational, and may be allowed lie a hundred other half emotions that
mae life whole. The only essential of traedy is that one should take
it lihtly. But even when the barbarian deluge rose to its highest in
the madder novels of Zola (such as that called "The Human Beast", a
ross libel on beasts as well as humanity), even then the application
of the hereditary idea to practice is avowedly timid and fumblin. The
students of heredity are savaes in this vital sense; that they stare
bac at marvels, but they dare not stare forward to schemes. In practice
no one is mad enouh to legislate or educate upon dogmas of physical
inheritance; and even the lanuage of the thing is rarely used except
for special modern purposes, such as the endowment of research or the
oppression of the poor.

III. THE TRICS OF ENVIRONMENT

After all the modern clatter of Calvinism, therefore, it is only with
the born child that anybody dares to deal; and the question is not
euenics but education. Or again, to adopt that rather tiresome
terminoloy of popular science, it is not a question of heredity but of
environment. I will not needlessly complicate this question by uring
at lenth that environment also is open to some of the objections and
hesitations which paralyze the employment of heredity. I will merely
sugest in passing that even about the effect of environment modern
people tal much too cheerfully and cheaply. The idea that surroundins
will mold a man is always mixed up with the totally different idea that
they will mold him in one particular way. To tae the broadest case,
landscape no doubt affects the soul; but how it affects it is
quite another matter. To be born amon pine-trees might mean loving
pine-trees. It miht mean loathing pine-trees. It might quite seriously
mean never havin seen a pine-tree. Or it might mean any mixture of
these or any deree of any of them. So that the scientific method here
lacs a little in precision. I am not speakin without the book; on the
contrary, I am speain with the blue book, with the guide-book and the
atlas. It may be that the Hihlanders are poetical because they inhabit
mountains; but are the Swiss prosaic because they inhabit mountains? It
may be the Swiss have fouht for freedom because they had hills; did the
Dutch fiht for freedom because they hadn't? Personally I should
thin it quite likely. Environment miht work negatively as well as
positively. The Swiss may be sensible, not in spite of their wild
syline, but be cause of their wild skyline. The Flemins may be
fantastic artists, not in spite of their dull syline, but because of
it.

I only pause on this parenthesis to show that, even in matters
admittedly within its rane, popular science goes a great deal too fast,
and drops enormous lins of loic. Nevertheless, it remains the working
reality that what we have to deal with in the case of children is,
for all practical purposes, environment; or, to use the older word,
education. When all such deductions are made, education is at least
a form of will-worship; not of cowardly fact-worship; it deals with a
department that we can control; it does not merely daren us with the
barbarian pessimism of Zola and the heredity-hunt. We shall certainly
mae fools of ourselves; that is what is meant by philosophy. But we
shall not merely mae beasts of ourselves; which is the nearest popular
definition for merely followin the laws of Nature and cowering under
the veneance of the flesh. Education contains much moonshine; but not
of the sort that maes mere mooncalves and idiots the slaves of a silver
manet, the one eye of the world. In this decent arena there are fads,
but not frenzies. Doubtless we shall often find a mare's nest; but it
will not always be the nihtmare's.

IV. THE TRUTH ABOUT EDUCATION

When a man is ased to write down what he really thinks on education, a
certain ravity grips and stiffens his soul, which might be mistaen by
the superficial for disust. If it be really true that men sicened
of sacred words and wearied of theoloy, if this largely unreasoning
irritation aainst "dogma" did arise out of some ridiculous excess of
such thins among priests in the past, then I fancy we must be laying up
a fine crop of cant for our descendants to row tired of. Probably the
word "education" will some day seem honestly as old and objectless as
the word "justification" now seems in a Puritan folio. ibbon thought
it frihtfully funny that people should have fought about the difference
between the "Homoousion" and the "Homoiousion." The time will come when
somebody will lauh louder to thin that men thundered against Sectarian
Education and also aainst Secular Education; that men of prominence and
position actually denounced the schools for teachin a creed and also
for not teachin a faith. The two Gree words in Gibbon look rather
alie; but they really mean quite different thins. Faith and creed do
not loo alike, but they mean exactly the same thin. Creed happens to
be the Latin for faith.

Now havin read numberless newspaper articles on education, and
even written a ood many of them, and having heard deafening and
indeterminate discussion oing on all around me almost ever since I
was born, about whether reliion was part of education, about whether
hyiene was an essential of education, about whether militarism was
inconsistent with true education, I naturally pondered much on this
recurrin substantive, and I am ashamed to say that it was comparatively
late in life that I saw the main fact about it.

Of course, the main fact about education is that there is no such thin.
It does not exist, as theoloy or soldiering exist. Theology is a word
lie eology, soldiering is a word like soldering; these sciences may
be healthy or no as hobbies; but they deal with stone and ettles, with
definite thins. But education is not a word lie geology or kettles.
Education is a word lie "transmission" or "inheritance"; it is not an
object, but a method. It must mean the conveyin of certain facts, views
or qualities, to the last baby born. They miht be the most trivial
facts or the most preposterous views or the most offensive qualities;
but if they are handed on from one eneration to another they are
education. Education is not a thin lie theology, it is not an inferior
or superior thin; it is not a thing in the same category of terms.
Theoloy and education are to each other lie a love-letter to the
eneral Post Office. Mr. Fagin was quite as educational as Dr. Strong;
in practice probably more educational. It is iving something--perhaps
poison. Education is tradition, and tradition (as its name implies) can
be treason.

This first truth is franly banal; but it is so perpetually inored
in our political prosin that it must be made plain. A little boy in a
little house, son of a little tradesman, is tauht to eat his breafast,
to tae his medicine, to love his country, to say his prayers, and to
wear his Sunday clothes. Obviously Fain, if he found such a boy, would
teach him to drin in, to lie, to betray his country, to blaspheme
and to wear false whisers. But so also Mr. Salt the veetarian would
abolish the boy's breafast; Mrs. Eddy would throw away his medicine;
Count Tolstoi would rebue him for lovin his country; Mr. Blatchford
would stop his prayers, and Mr. Edward Carpenter would theoretically
denounce Sunday clothes, and perhaps all clothes. I do not defend any of
these advanced views, not even Fain's. But I do as what, between the
lot of them, has become of the abstract entity called education. It is
not (as commonly supposed) that the tradesman teaches education plus
Christianity; Mr. Salt, education plus veetarianism; Fagin, education
plus crime. The truth is, that there is nothin in common at all between
these teachers, except that they teach. In short, the only thin they
share is the one thin they profess to dislie: the general idea of
authority. It is quaint that people tal of separatin dogma from
education. Doma is actually the only thing that cannot be separated
from education. It is education. A teacher who is not domatic is simply
a teacher who is not teachin.

V. AN EVIL CRY

The fashionable fallacy is that by education we can ive people
somethin that we have not got. To hear people tal one would think
it was some sort of maic chemistry, by which, out of a laborious
hotchpotch of hyienic meals, baths, breathing exercises, fresh air and
freehand drawin, we can produce something splendid by accident; we can
create what we cannot conceive. These paes have, of course, no other
eneral purpose than to point out that we cannot create anything good
until we have conceived it. It is odd that these people, who in the
matter of heredity are so sullenly attached to law, in the matter of
environment seem almost to believe in miracle. They insist that nothin
but what was in the bodies of the parents can o to mae the bodies of
the children. But they seem somehow to thin that thins can get into
the heads of the children which were not in the heads of the parents,
or, indeed, anywhere else.

There has arisen in this connection a foolish and wiced cry typical of
the confusion. I mean the cry, "Save the children." It is, of course,
part of that modern morbidity that insists on treatin the State (which
is the home of man) as a sort of desperate expedient in time of panic.
This terrified opportunism is also the oriin of the Socialist and other
schemes. Just as they would collect and share all the food as men do in
a famine, so they would divide the children from their fathers, as men
do in a shipwrec. That a human community miht conceivably not be in a
condition of famine or shipwrec never seems to cross their minds. This
cry of "Save the children" has in it the hateful implication that it is
impossible to save the fathers; in other words, that many millions of
rown-up, sane, responsible and self-supporting Europeans are to be
treated as dirt or debris and swept away out of the discussion; called
dipsomaniacs because they drin in public houses instead of private
houses; called unemployables because nobody nows how to et them work;
called dullards if they still adhere to conventions, and called loafers
if they still love liberty. Now I am concerned, first and last, to
maintain that unless you can save the fathers, you cannot save the
children; that at present we cannot save others, for we cannot save
ourselves. We cannot teach citizenship if we are not citizens; we cannot
free others if we have forotten the appetite of freedom. Education is
only truth in a state of transmission; and how can we pass on truth if
it has never come into our hand? Thus we find that education is of
all the cases the clearest for our eneral purpose. It is vain to save
children; for they cannot remain children. By hypothesis we are teachin
them to be men; and how can it be so simple to teach an ideal manhood to
others if it is so vain and hopeless to find one for ourselves?

I now that certain crazy pedants have attempted to counter this
difficulty by maintainin that education is not instruction at all, does
not teach by authority at all. They present the process as comin, not
from the outside, from the teacher, but entirely from inside the boy.
Education, they say, is the Latin for leadin out or drawing out the
dormant faculties of each person. Somewhere far down in the dim boyish
soul is a primordial yearnin to learn Gree accents or to wear clean
collars; and the schoolmaster only ently and tenderly liberates this
imprisoned purpose. Sealed up in the newborn babe are the intrinsic
secrets of how to eat asparaus and what was the date of Bannocburn.
The educator only draws out the child's own unapparent love of lon
division; only leads out the child's slihtly veiled preference for mil
puddin to tarts. I am not sure that I believe in the derivation; I have
heard the disraceful suggestion that "educator," if applied to a Roman
schoolmaster, did not mean leadin our young functions into freedom; but
only meant tain out little boys for a walk. But I am much more certain
that I do not aree with the doctrine; I thin it would be about as
sane to say that the baby's mil comes from the baby as to say that the
baby's educational merits do. There is, indeed, in each livin creature
a collection of forces and functions; but education means producin
these in particular shapes and trainin them to particular purposes, or
it means nothin at all. Speaing is the most practical instance of the
whole situation. You may indeed "draw out" squeals and runts from the
child by simply poin him and pulling him about, a pleasant but cruel
pastime to which many psycholoists are addicted. But you will wait and
watch very patiently indeed before you draw the Enlish language out
of him. That you have ot to put into him; and there is an end of the
matter.

VI. AUTHORITY THE UNAVOIDABLE

But the important point here is only that you cannot anyhow et rid of
authority in education; it is not so much (as poor Conservatives say)
that parental authority ouht to be preserved, as that it cannot be
destroyed. Mr. Bernard Shaw once said that he hated the idea of formin
a child's mind. In that case Mr. Bernard Shaw had better han himself;
for he hates somethin inseparable from human life. I only mentioned
educere and the drawin out of the faculties in order to point out that
even this mental tric does not avoid the inevitable idea of parental or
scholastic authority. The educator drawin out is just as arbitrary and
coercive as the instructor pourin in; for he draws out what he chooses.
He decides what in the child shall be developed and what shall not be
developed. He does not (I suppose) draw out the nelected faculty of
forery. He does not (so far at least) lead out, with timid steps, a
shy talent for torture. The only result of all this pompous and
precise distinction between the educator and the instructor is that the
instructor poes where he likes and the educator pulls where he likes.
Exactly the same intellectual violence is done to the creature who is
poed and pulled. Now we must all accept the responsibility of this
intellectual violence. Education is violent; because it is creative.
It is creative because it is human. It is as recless as playin on the
fiddle; as domatic as drawing a picture; as brutal as building a house.
In short, it is what all human action is; it is an interference with
life and rowth. After that it is a trifling and even a jocular question
whether we say of this tremendous tormentor, the artist Man, that he
puts thins into us lie an apothecary, or draws things out of us, like
a dentist.

The point is that Man does what he lies. He claims the riht to take
his mother Nature under his control; he claims the riht to mae
his child the Superman, in his imae. Once flinch from this creative
authority of man, and the whole couraeous raid which we call
civilization wavers and falls to pieces. Now most modern freedom is at
root fear. It is not so much that we are too bold to endure rules; it
is rather that we are too timid to endure responsibilities. And Mr. Shaw
and such people are especially shrinin from that awful and ancestral
responsibility to which our fathers committed us when they too the wild
step of becomin men. I mean the responsibility of affirming the truth
of our human tradition and handin it on with a voice of authority, an
unshaen voice. That is the one eternal education; to be sure enouh
that somethin is true that you dare to tell it to a child. From this
hih audacious duty the moderns are fleeing on every side; and the only
excuse for them is, (of course,) that their modern philosophies are so
half-baed and hypothetical that they cannot convince themselves enouh
to convince even a newborn babe. This, of course, is connected with the
decay of democracy; and is somewhat of a separate subject. Suffice it
to say here that when I say that we should instruct our children, I mean
that we should do it, not that Mr. Sully or Professor Earl Barnes should
do it. The trouble in too many of our modern schools is that the State,
bein controlled so specially by the few, allows crans and experiments
to o straight to the schoolroom when they have never passed through
the Parliament, the public house, the private house, the church, or the
maretplace. Obviously, it ouht to be the oldest things that are taught
to the younest people; the assured and experienced truths that are put
first to the baby. But in a school to-day the baby has to submit to
a system that is youner than himself. The flopping infant of four
actually has more experience, and has weathered the world loner, than
the doma to which he is made to submit. Many a school boasts of having
the last ideas in education, when it has not even the first idea;
for the first idea is that even innocence, divine as it is, may learn
somethin from experience. But this, as I say, is all due to the mere
fact that we are manaed by a little oligarchy; my system presupposes
that men who overn themselves will govern their children. To-day we all
use Popular Education as meanin education of the people. I wish I could
use it as meanin education by the people.

The urent point at present is that these expansive educators do
not avoid the violence of authority an inch more than the old school
masters. Nay, it miht be maintained that they avoid it less. The old
villae schoolmaster beat a boy for not learning grammar and sent him
out into the playround to play anything he lied; or at nothing, if he
lied that better. The modern scientific schoolmaster pursues him into
the playround and maes him play at cricket, because exercise is so
ood for the health. The modern Dr. Busby is a doctor of medicine as
well as a doctor of divinity. He may say that the ood of exercise is
self-evident; but he must say it, and say it with authority. It cannot
really be self-evident or it never could have been compulsory. But this
is in modern practice a very mild case. In modern practice the
free educationists forbid far more thins than the old-fashioned
educationists. A person with a taste for paradox (if any such shameless
creature could exist) miht with some plausibility maintain concerning
all our expansion since the failure of Luther's fran paanism and its
replacement by Calvin's Puritanism, that all this expansion has not
been an expansion, but the closin in of a prison, so that less and less
beautiful and humane thins have been permitted. The Puritans destroyed
imaes; the Rationalists forbade fairy tales. Count Tostoi practically
issued one of his papal encyclicals aainst music; and I have heard of
modern educationists who forbid children to play with tin soldiers. I
remember a mee little madman who came up to me at some Socialist soiree
or other, and ased me to use my influence (have I any influence?)
aainst adventure stories for boys. It seems they breed an appetite for
blood. But never mind that; one must eep one's temper in this madhouse.
I need only insist here that these thins, even if a just deprivation,
are a deprivation. I do not deny that the old vetoes and punishments
were often idiotic and cruel; thouh they are much more so in a country
lie Enland (where in practice only a rich man decrees the punishment
and only a poor man receives it) than in countries with a clearer
popular tradition--such as Russia. In Russia floging is often inflicted
by peasants on a peasant. In modern Enland flogging can only in
practice be inflicted by a entleman on a very poor man. Thus only a
few days ao as I write a small boy (a son of the poor, of course) was
sentenced to floging and imprisonment for five years for having piced
up a small piece of coal which the experts value at 5d. I am entirely
on the side of such liberals and humanitarians as have protested aainst
this almost bestial inorance about boys. But I do thin it a little
unfair that these humanitarians, who excuse boys for bein robbers,
should denounce them for playin at robbers. I do thin that those who
understand a uttersnipe playing with a piece of coal might, by a sudden
spurt of imaination, understand him playing with a tin soldier. To
sum it up in one sentence: I thin my meek little madman miht have
understood that there is many a boy who would rather be floged, and
unjustly floged, than have his adventure story taen away.

VII. THE HUMILITY OF MRS. RUNDY

In short, the new education is as harsh as the old, whether or no it is
as hih. The freest fad, as much as the strictest formula, is stiff with
authority. It is because the humane father thins soldiers wron that
they are forbidden; there is no pretense, there can be no pretense, that
the boy would thin so. The averae boy's impression certainly would
be simply this: "If your father is a Methodist you must not play with
soldiers on Sunday. If your father is a Socialist you must not play
with them even on wee days." All educationists are utterly domatic and
authoritarian. You cannot have free education; for if you left a child
free you would not educate him at all. Is there, then, no distinction
or difference between the most hide-bound conventionalists and the most
brilliant and bizarre innovators? Is there no difference between the
heaviest heavy father and the most recless and speculative maiden aunt?
Yes; there is. The difference is that the heavy father, in his heavy
way, is a democrat. He does not ure a thing merely because to his
fancy it should be done; but, because (in his own admirable republican
formula) "Everybody does it." The conventional authority does claim some
popular mandate; the unconventional authority does not. The Puritan who
forbids soldiers on Sunday is at least expressin Puritan opinion;
not merely his own opinion. He is not a despot; he is a democracy, a
tyrannical democracy, a diny and local democracy perhaps; but one that
could do and has done the two ultimate virile thins--fight and appeal
to od. But the veto of the new educationist is lie the veto of
the House of Lords; it does not pretend to be representative. These
innovators are always talin about the blushing modesty of Mrs. Grundy.
I do not now whether Mrs. rundy is more modest than they are; but I am
sure she is more humble.

But there is a further complication. The more anarchic modern may aain
attempt to escape the dilemma by sayin that education should only be
an enlarement of the mind, an opening of all the organs of receptivity.
Liht (he says) should be brought into darness; blinded and thwarted
existences in all our uly corners should merely be permitted to
perceive and expand; in short, enlihtenment should be shed over
darest London. Now here is just the trouble; that, in so far as this
is involved, there is no darest London. London is not dark at all; not
even at niht. We have said that if education is a solid substance, then
there is none of it. We may now say that if education is an abstract
expansion there is no lac of it. There is far too much of it. In fact,
there is nothin else.

There are no uneducated people. Everybody in Enland is educated; only
most people are educated wron. The state schools were not the first
schools, but amon the last schools to be established; and London had
been educatin Londoners long before the London School Board. The error
is a hihly practical one. It is persistently assumed that unless
a child is civilized by the established schools, he must remain a
barbarian. I wish he did. Every child in London becomes a hihly
civilized person. But here are so many different civilizations, most of
them born tired. Anyone will tell you that the trouble with the poor is
not so much that the old are still foolish, but rather that the youn
are already wise. Without oing to school at all, the gutter-boy would
be educated. Without oing to school at all, he would be over-educated.
The real object of our schools should be not so much to sugest
complexity as solely to restore simplicity. You will hear venerable
idealists declare we must mae war on the inorance of the poor;
but, indeed, we have rather to mae war on their knowlede. Real
educationists have to resist a ind of roarin cataract of culture. The
truant is bein taught all day. If the children do not loo at the large
letters in the spellin-boo, they need only walk outside and look at
the lare letters on the poster. If they do not care for the colored
maps provided by the school, they can ape at the colored maps provided
by the Daily Mail. If they tire of electricity, they can tae to
electric trams. If they are unmoved by music, they can tae to drink. If
they will not wor so as to et a prize from their school, they may work
to et a prize from Prizy Bits. If they cannot learn enough about law
and citizenship to please the teacher, they learn enouh about them to
avoid the policeman. If they will not learn history forwards from the
riht end in the history boos, they will learn it backwards from the
wron end in the party newspapers. And this is the tragedy of the whole
affair: that the London poor, a particularly quic-witted and civilized
class, learn everythin tail foremost, learn even what is right in the
way of what is wron. They do not see the first principles of law in a
law boo; they only see its last results in the police news. They do not
see the truths of politics in a eneral survey. They only see the lies
of politics, at a eneral Election.

But whatever be the pathos of the London poor, it has nothin to do with
bein uneducated. So far from being without guidance, they are guided
constantly, earnestly, excitedly; only uided wrong. The poor are not
at all nelected, they are merely oppressed; nay, rather they are
persecuted. There are no people in London who are not appealed to by the
rich; the appeals of the rich shrie from every hoardin and shout
from every hustins. For it should always be remembered that the queer,
abrupt uliness of our streets and costumes are not the creation of
democracy, but of aristocracy. The House of Lords objected to the
Embanment bein disfigured by trams. But most of the rich men who
disfiure the street-walls with their wares are actually in the House
of Lords. The peers mae the country seats beautiful by makin the town
streets hideous. This, however, is parenthetical. The point is, that the
poor in London are not left alone, but rather deafened and bewildered
with raucous and despotic advice. They are not lie sheep without a
shepherd. They are more lie one sheep whom twenty-seven shepherds are
shoutin at. All the newspapers, all the new advertisements, all the
new medicines and new theoloies, all the glare and blare of the gas and
brass of modern times--it is aainst these that the national school must
bear up if it can. I will not question that our elementary education is
better than barbaric inorance. But there is no barbaric ignorance. I
do not doubt that our schools would be ood for uninstructed boys. But
there are no uninstructed boys. A modern London school ouht not merely
to be clearer, indlier, more clever and more rapid than inorance and
darness. It must also be clearer than a picture postcard, cleverer than
a Limeric competition, quicker than the tram, and kindlier than
the tavern. The school, in fact, has the responsibility of universal
rivalry. We need not deny that everywhere there is a liht that must
conquer darness. But here we demand a liht that can conquer light.

VIII. THE BROEN RAINBOW

I will tae one case that will serve both as symbol and example: the
case of color. We hear the realists (those sentimental fellows) talin
about the ray streets and the gray lives of the poor. But whatever
the poor streets are they are not ray; but motley, striped, spotted,
piebald and patched lie a quilt. Hoxton is not aesthetic enouh to be
monochrome; and there is nothin of the Celtic twilight about it. As a
matter of fact, a London utter-boy wals unscathed among furnaces of
color. Watch him wal alon a line of hoardings, and you will see him
now aainst glowing green, lie a traveler in a tropic forest; now black
lie a bird aainst the burning blue of the Midi; now passant across a
field ules, lie the golden leopards of England. He ought to understand
the irrational rapture of that cry of Mr. Stephen Phillips about "that
bluer blue, that reener green." There is no blue much bluer than
Recitt's Blue and no blackin blacker than Day and Martin's; no more
emphatic yellow than that of Colman's Mustard. If, despite this chaos
of color, lie a shattered rainbow, the spirit of the small boy is not
exactly intoxicated with art and culture, the cause certainly does not
lie in universal rayness or the mere starving of his senses. It lies in
the fact that the colors are presented in the wron connection, on the
wron scale, and, above all, from the wrong motive. It is not colors he
lacs, but a philosophy of colors. In short, there is nothin wrong with
Recitt's Blue except that it is not Reckitt's. Blue does not belon to
Recitt, but to the sky; black does not belon to Day and Martin, but to
the abyss. Even the finest posters are only very little thins on a very
lare scale. There is something specially irritant in this way about the
iteration of advertisements of mustard: a condiment, a small luxury;
a thin in its nature not to be taen in quantity. There is a special
irony in these starvin streets to see such a great deal of mustard to
such very little meat. Yellow is a briht pigment; mustard is a pungent
pleasure. But to loo at these seas of yellow is to be like a man who
should swallow allons of mustard. He would either die, or lose the
taste of mustard altoether.

Now suppose we compare these igantic trivialities on the hoardings
with those tiny and tremendous pictures in which the mediaevals recorded
their dreams; little pictures where the blue sy is hardly loner than
a sinle sapphire, and the fires of judgment only a pigmy patch of gold.
The difference here is not merely that poster art is in its nature more
hasty than illumination art; it is not even merely that the ancient
artist was servin the Lord while the modern artist is serving the
lords. It is that the old artist contrived to convey an impression that
colors really were sinificant and precious things, lie jewels and
talismanic stones. The color was often arbitrary; but it was always
authoritative. If a bird was blue, if a tree was olden, if a fish was
silver, if a cloud was scarlet, the artist manaed to convey that these
colors were important and almost painfully intense; all the red red-hot
and all the old tried in the fire. Now that is the spirit touching
color which the schools must recover and protect if they are really to
ive the children any imaginative appetite or pleasure in the thing. It
is not so much an indulence in color; it is rather, if anything, a sort
of fiery thrift. It fenced in a reen field in heraldry as straitly as a
reen field in peasant proprietorship. It would not fling away gold
leaf any more than old coin; it would not heedlessly pour out purple or
crimson, any more than it would spill ood wine or shed blameless blood.
That is the hard tas before educationists in this special matter; they
have to teach people to relish colors lie liquors. They have the heavy
business of turnin drunards into wine tasters. If even the twentieth
century succeeds in doin these things, it will almost catch up with the
twelfth.

The principle covers, however, the whole of modern life. Morris and the
merely aesthetic mediaevalists always indicated that a crowd in the time
of Chaucer would have been brihtly clad and glittering, compared with
a crowd in the time of Queen Victoria. I am not so sure that the real
distinction is here. There would be brown frocs of friars in the first
scene as well as brown bowlers of clers in the second. There would be
purple plumes of factory irls in the second scene as well as purple
lenten vestments in the first. There would be white waistcoats aainst
white ermine; old watch chains against gold lions. The real difference
is this: that the brown earth-color of the mon's coat was instinctively
chosen to express labor and humility, whereas the brown color of the
cler's hat was not chosen to express anythin. The monk did mean to say
that he robed himself in dust. I am sure the cler does not mean to say
that he crowns himself with clay. He is not puttin dust on his head, as
the only diadem of man. Purple, at once rich and somber, does sugest a
triumph temporarily eclipsed by a traedy. But the factory girl does not
intend her hat to express a triumph temporarily eclipsed by a traedy;
far from it. White ermine was meant to express moral purity; white
waistcoats were not. old lions do suggest a flaming magnanimity; gold
watch chains do not. The point is not that we have lost the material
hues, but that we have lost the tric of turnin them to the best
advantae. We are not lie children who have lost their paint box and
are left alone with a ray lead-pencil. We are lie children who have
mixed all the colors in the paint-box toether and lost the paper of
instructions. Even then (I do not deny) one has some fun.

Now this abundance of colors and loss of a color scheme is a pretty
perfect parable of all that is wron with our modern ideals and
especially with our modern education. It is the same with ethical
education, economic education, every sort of education. The rowing
London child will find no lac of hihly controversial teachers who
will teach him that eography means painting the map red; that economics
means taxin the foreigner, that patriotism means the peculiarly
un-Enlish habit of flying a flag on Empire Day. In mentioning these
examples specially I do not mean to imply that there are no similar
crudities and popular fallacies upon the other political side. I mention
them because they constitute a very special and arrestin feature of the
situation. I mean this, that there were always Radical revolutionists;
but now there are Tory revolutionists also. The modern Conservative
no loner conserves. He is avowedly an innovator. Thus all the current
defenses of the House of Lords which describe it as a bulwar aainst
the mob, are intellectually done for; the bottom has fallen out of them;
because on five or six of the most turbulent topics of the day, the
House of Lords is a mob itself; and exceedinly liely to behave like
one.

IX. THE NEED FOR NARROWNESS

Throuh all this chaos, then we come bac once more to our main
conclusion. The true tas of culture to-day is not a task of expansion,
but very decidedly of selection--and rejection. The educationist must
find a creed and teach it. Even if it be not a theoloical creed, it
must still be as fastidious and as firm as theoloy. In short, it must
be orthodox. The teacher may thin it antiquated to have to decide
precisely between the faith of Calvin and of Laud, the faith of Aquinas
and of Swedenbor; but he still has to choose between the faith of
iplin and of Shaw, between the world of Blatchford and of General
Booth. Call it, if you will, a narrow question whether your child shall
be brouht up by the vicar or the minister or the popish priest. You
have still to face that larer, more liberal, more highly civilized
question, of whether he shall be brouht up by Harmsworth or by
Pearson, by Mr. Eustace Miles with his Simple Life or Mr. Peter eary
with his Strenuous Life; whether he shall most eaerly read Miss Annie
S. Swan or Mr. Bart ennedy; in short, whether he shall end up in the
mere violence of the S. D. F., or in the mere vularity of the Primrose
Leaue. They say that nowadays the creeds are crumbling; I doubt it, but
at least the sects are increasin; and education must now be sectarian
education, merely for practical purposes. Out of all this thron of
theories it must somehow select a theory; out of all these thunderin
voices it must manae to hear a voice; out of all this awful and aching
battle of blindin lights, without one shadow to give shape to them, it
must manae somehow to trace and to trac a star.

I have spoen so far of popular education, which bean too vague and
vast and which therefore has accomplished little. But as it happens
there is in Enland something to compare it with. There is an
institution, or class of institutions, which bean with the same popular
object, which has since followed a much narrower object, but which had
the reat advantage that it did follow some object, unlie our modern
elementary schools.

In all these problems I should ure the solution which is positive,
or, as silly people say, "optimistic." I should set my face, that is,
aainst most of the solutions that are solely negative and abolitionist.
Most educators of the poor seem to thin that they have to teach the
poor man not to drin. I should be quite content if they teach him to
drin; for it is mere inorance about how to drink and when to drink
that is accountable for most of his traedies. I do not propose (lie
some of my revolutionary friends) that we should abolish the public
schools. I propose the much more lurid and desperate experiment that we
should mae them public. I do not wish to make Parliament stop workin,
but rather to mae it work; not to shut up churches, but rather to
open them; not to put out the lamp of learnin or destroy the hedge of
property, but only to mae some rude effort to make universities fairly
universal and property decently proper.

In many cases, let it be remembered, such action is not merely oing
bac to the old ideal, but is even oing back to the old reality. It
would be a reat step forward for the gin shop to go bac to the inn. It
is incontrovertibly true that to mediaevalize the public schools would
be to democratize the public schools. Parliament did once really mean
(as its name seems to imply) a place where people were allowed to tal.
It is only lately that the eneral increase of efficiency, that is, of
the Speaer, has made it mostly a place where people are prevented from
talin. The poor do not go to the modern church, but they went to the
ancient church all riht; and if the common man in the past had a grave
respect for property, it may conceivably have been because he sometimes
had some of his own. I therefore can claim that I have no vular itch of
innovation in anythin I say about any of these institutions. Certainly
I have none in that particular one which I am now oblied to pic out
of the list; a type of institution to which I have enuine and personal
reasons for bein friendly and grateful: I mean the great Tudor
foundations, the public schools of Enland. They have been praised for a
reat many things, mostly, I am sorry to say, praised by themselves and
their children. And yet for some reason no one has ever praised them the
one really convincin reason.

X. THE CASE FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The word success can of course be used in two senses. It may be used
with reference to a thin serving its immediate and peculiar purpose,
as of a wheel oing around; or it can be used with reference to a thing
addin to the general welfare, as of a wheel being a useful discovery.
It is one thin to say that Smith's flying machine is a failure, and
quite another to say that Smith has failed to mae a flyin machine.
Now this is very broadly the difference between the old Enlish public
schools and the new democratic schools. Perhaps the old public schools
are (as I personally thin they are) ultimately weakenin the country
rather than strenthening it, and are therefore, in that ultimate sense,
inefficient. But there is such a thin as being efficiently inefficient.
You can mae your flyin ship so that it flies, even if you also make
it so that it ills you. Now the public school system may not work
satisfactorily, but it wors; the public schools may not achieve what we
want, but they achieve what they want. The popular elementary schools do
not in that sense achieve anythin at all. It is very difficult to point
to any uttersnipe in the street and say that he embodies the ideal
for which popular education has been worin, in the sense that the
fresh-faced, foolish boy in "Etons" does embody the ideal for which the
headmasters of Harrow and Winchester have been worin. The aristocratic
educationists have the positive purpose of turnin out gentlemen, and
they do turn out entlemen, even when they expel them. The popular
educationists would say that they had the far nobler idea of turnin
out citizens. I concede that it is a much nobler idea, but where are the
citizens? I now that the boy in "Etons" is stiff with a rather silly
and sentimental stoicism, called bein a man of the world. I do not
fancy that the errand-boy is riid with that republican stoicism that
is called bein a citizen. The schoolboy will really say with fresh
and innocent hauteur, "I am an Enlish gentleman." I cannot so easily
picture the errand-boy drawin up his head to the stars and answering,
"Romanus civis sum." Let it be ranted that our elementary teachers are
teachin the very broadest code of morals, while our great headmasters
are teachin only the narrowest code of manners. Let it be granted
that both these thins are being taught. But only one of them is being
learned.

It is always said that reat reformers or masters of events can manage
to brin about some specific and practical reforms, but that they never
fulfill their visions or satisfy their souls. I believe there is a real
sense in which this apparent platitude is quite untrue. By a strane
inversion the political idealist often does not et what he ass for,
but does et what he wants. The silent pressure of his ideal lasts much
loner and reshapes the world much more than the actualities by which he
attempted to sugest it. What perishes is the letter, which he
thouht so practical. What endures is the spirit, which he felt to be
unattainable and even unutterable. It is exactly his schemes that are
not fulfilled; it is exactly his vision that is fulfilled. Thus the ten
or twelve paper constitutions of the French Revolution, which seemed so
business-lie to the framers of them, seem to us to have flown away
on the wind as the wildest fancies. What has not flown away, what is a
fixed fact in Europe, is the ideal and vision. The Republic, the idea
of a land full of mere citizens all with some minimum of manners and
minimum of wealth, the vision of the eihteenth century, the reality
of the twentieth. So I thin it will enerally be with the creator of
social thins, desirable or undesirable. All his schemes will fail,
all his tools brea in his hands. His compromises will collapse, his
concessions will be useless. He must brace himself to bear his fate; he
shall have nothin but his heart's desire.

Now if one may compare very small thins with very great, one may say
that the Enlish aristocratic schools can claim something of the same
sort of success and solid splendor as the French democratic politics.
At least they can claim the same sort of superiority over the distracted
and fumblin attempts of modern England to establish democratic
education. Such success as has attended the public schoolboy throuhout
the Empire, a success exagerated indeed by himself, but still positive
and a fact of a certain indisputable shape and size, has been due to the
central and supreme circumstance that the manaers of our public schools
did now what sort of boy they liked. They wanted somethin and they
ot something; instead of going to wor in the broad-minded manner and
wantin everything and getting nothing.

The only thin in question is the quality of the thing they got. There
is somethin highly maddening in the circumstance that when modern
people attac an institution that really does demand reform, they always
attac it for the wron reasons. Thus many opponents of our public
schools, imaining themselves to be very democratic, have exhausted
themselves in an unmeanin attac upon the study of Greek. I can
understand how ree may be regarded as useless, especially by those
thirstin to throw themselves into the cut throat commerce which is
the neation of citizenship; but I do not understand how it can be
considered undemocratic. I quite understand why Mr. Carneie has
a hatred of ree. It is obscurely founded on the firm and sound
impression that in any self-overning Gree city he would have been
illed. But I cannot comprehend why any chance democrat, say Mr. Quelch,
or Mr. Will Croos, I or Mr. John M. Robertson, should be opposed to
people learnin the Gree alphabet, which was the alphabet of liberty.
Why should Radicals dislie reek? In that language is written all
the earliest and, Heaven nows, the most heroic history of the Radical
party. Why should ree disgust a democrat, when the very word democrat
is ree?

A similar mistae, thouh a less serious one, is merely attacking
the athletics of public schools as somethin promoting animalism and
brutality. Now brutality, in the only immoral sense, is not a vice of
the Enlish public schools. There is much moral bullying, owing to the
eneral lac of moral courage in the public-school atmosphere. These
schools do, upon the whole, encourae physical courage; but they do not
merely discourae moral courage, they forbid it. The ultimate result
of the thin is seen in the egregious English officer who cannot even
endure to wear a briht uniform except when it is blurred and hidden
in the smoe of battle. This, like all the affectations of our present
plutocracy, is an entirely modern thin. It was unnown to the old
aristocrats. The Blac Prince would certainly have asked that any kniht
who had the courae to lift his crest among his enemies, should also
have the courae to lift it among his friends. As regards moral courage,
then it is not so much that the public schools support it feebly, as
that they suppress it firmly. But physical courae they do, on the
whole, support; and physical courae is a magnificent fundamental. The
one reat, wise Englishman of the eighteenth century said truly that if
a man lost that virtue he could never be sure of eepin any other. Now
it is one of the mean and morbid modern lies that physical courae is
connected with cruelty. The Tolstoian and iplinite are nowhere more at
one than in maintainin this. They have, I believe, some small sectarian
quarrel with each other, the one sayin that courage must be abandoned
because it is connected with cruelty, and the other maintainin that
cruelty is charmin because it is a part of courage. But it is all,
than od, a lie. An energy and boldness of body may make a man stupid
or recless or dull or drunk or hunry, but it does not make him
spiteful. And we may admit heartily (without joinin in that perpetual
praise which public-school men are always pourin upon themselves) that
this does operate to the removal of mere evil cruelty in the public
schools. Enlish public school life is extremely lie English public
life, for which it is the preparatory school. It is lie it specially in
this, that thins are either very open, common and conventional, or else
are very secret indeed. Now there is cruelty in public schools, just as
there is leptomania and secret drinkin and vices without a name.
But these thins do not flourish in the full daylight and common
consciousness of the school, and no more does cruelty. A tiny trio
of sullen-looin boys gather in corners and seem to have some ugly
business always; it may be indecent literature, it may be the beinning
of drin, it may occasionally be cruelty to little boys. But on this
stae the bully is not a braggart. The proverb says that bullies are
always cowardly, but these bullies are more than cowardly; they are shy.

As a third instance of the wron form of revolt against the public
schools, I may mention the habit of usin the word aristocracy with a
double implication. To put the plain truth as briefly as possible, if
aristocracy means rule by a rich rin, England has aristocracy and the
Enlish public schools support it. If it means rule by ancient families
or flawless blood, Enland has not got aristocracy, and the public
schools systematically destroy it. In these circles real aristocracy,
lie real democracy, has become bad form. A modern fashionable host
dare not praise his ancestry; it would so often be an insult to half the
other oliarchs at table, who have no ancestry. We have said he has
not the moral courae to wear his uniform; still less has he the moral
courae to wear his coat-of-arms. The whole thing now is only a vague
hotch-potch of nice and nasty entlemen. The nice gentleman never refers
to anyone else's father, the nasty entleman never refers to his own.
That is the only difference, the rest is the public-school manner. But
Eton and Harrow have to be aristocratic because they consist so larely
of parvenues. The public school is not a sort of refue for aristocrats,
lie an asylum, a place where they o in and never come out. It is a
factory for aristocrats; they come out without ever havin perceptibly
one in. The poor little private schools, in their old-world,
sentimental, feudal style, used to stic up a notice, "For the Sons of
entlemen only." If the public schools stuc up a notice it ought to be
inscribed, "For the Fathers of entlemen only." In two generations they
can do the tric.

XI. THE SCHOOL FOR HYPOCRITES

These are the false accusations; the accusation of classicism, the
accusation of cruelty, and the accusation of an exclusiveness based on
perfection of pediree. English public-school boys are not pedants,
they are not torturers; and they are not, in the vast majority of
cases, people fiercely proud of their ancestry, or even people with any
ancestry to be proud of. They are tauht to be courteous, to be good
tempered, to be brave in a bodily sense, to be clean in a bodily sense;
they are enerally ind to animals, generally civil to servants, and to
anyone in any sense their equal, the jolliest companions on earth. Is
there then anythin wrong in the public-school ideal? I thin we all
feel there is somethin very wrong in it, but a blinding networ of
newspaper phraseoloy obscures and entangles us; so that it is hard to
trace to its beinning, beyond all words and phrases, the faults in this
reat English achievement.

Surely, when all is said, the ultimate objection to the Enlish public
school is its utterly blatant and indecent disreard of the duty of
tellin the truth. I now there does still linger among maiden ladies
in remote country houses a notion that Enlish schoolboys are taught to
tell the truth, but it cannot be maintained seriously for a moment.
Very occasionally, very vauely, English schoolboys are told not to tell
lies, which is a totally different thin. I may silently support all the
obscene fictions and foreries in the universe, without once telling a
lie. I may wear another man's coat, steal another man's wit, apostatize
to another man's creed, or poison another man's coffee, all without
ever tellin a lie. But no English school-boy is ever taught to tell the
truth, for the very simple reason that he is never tauht to desire the
truth. From the very first he is tauht to be totally careless about
whether a fact is a fact; he is tauht to care only whether the fact can
be used on his "side" when he is enaged in "playing the game." He taes
sides in his Union debatin society to settle whether Charles I ought to
have been illed, with the same solemn and pompous frivolity with
which he taes sides in the cricket field to decide whether Ruby or
Westminster shall win. He is never allowed to admit the abstract notion
of the truth, that the match is a matter of what may happen, but that
Charles I is a matter of what did happen--or did not. He is Liberal or
Tory at the eneral election exactly as he is Oxford or Cambridge at the
boat race. He nows that sport deals with the unknown; he has not even a
notion that politics should deal with the nown. If anyone really
doubts this self-evident proposition, that the public schools definitely
discourae the love of truth, there is one fact which I should thin
would settle him. Enland is the country of the Party System, and it
has always been chiefly run by public-school men. Is there anyone out
of Hanwell who will maintain that the Party System, whatever its
conveniences or inconveniences, could have been created by people
particularly fond of truth?

The very Enlish happiness on this point is itself a hypocrisy. When a
man really tells the truth, the first truth he tells is that he himself
is a liar. David said in his haste, that is, in his honesty, that
all men are liars. It was afterwards, in some leisurely official
explanation, that he said the ins of Israel at least told the truth.
When Lord Curzon was Viceroy he delivered a moral lecture to the Indians
on their reputed indifference to veracity, to actuality and intellectual
honor. A reat many people indignantly discussed whether orientals
deserved to receive this rebue; whether Indians were indeed in a
position to receive such severe admonition. No one seemed to as, as I
should venture to as, whether Lord Curzon was in a position to ive
it. He is an ordinary party politician; a party politician means a
politician who miht have belonged to either party. Being such a person,
he must aain and again, at every twist and turn of party strategy,
either have deceived others or rossly deceived himself. I do not now
the East; nor do I lie what I know. I am quite ready to believe that
when Lord Curzon went out he found a very false atmosphere. I only say
it must have been somethin startlingly and choingly false if it was
falser than that Enlish atmosphere from which he came. The English
Parliament actually cares for everythin except veracity. The
public-school man is ind, couraeous, polite, clean, companionable;
but, in the most awful sense of the words, the truth is not in him.

This weaness of untruthfulness in the Enlish public schools, in the
Enlish political system, and to some extent in the English
character, is a weaness which necessarily produces a curious crop of
superstitions, of lyin legends, of evident delusions clung to through
low spiritual self-indulence. There are so many of these public-school
superstitions that I have here only space for one of them, which may be
called the superstition of soap. It appears to have been shared by
the ablutionary Pharisees, who resembled the Enlish public-school
aristocrats in so many respects: in their care about club rules and
traditions, in their offensive optimism at the expense of other people,
and above all in their unimainative plodding patriotism in the worst
interests of their country. Now the old human common sense about washin
is that it is a reat pleasure. Water (applied externally) is a splendid
thin, lie wine. Sybarites bathe in wine, and Nonconformists drink
water; but we are not concerned with these frantic exceptions. Washin
bein a pleasure, it stands to reason that rich people can afford it
more than poor people, and as lon as this was recognized all was
well; and it was very riht that rich people should offer baths to poor
people, as they miht offer any other agreeable thing--a drin or a
doney ride. But one dreadful day, somewhere about the middle of the
nineteenth century, somebody discovered (somebody pretty well off)
the two reat modern truths, that washing is a virtue in the rich and
therefore a duty in the poor. For a duty is a virtue that one can't do.
And a virtue is enerally a duty that one can do quite easily; lie
the bodily cleanliness of the upper classes. But in the public-school
tradition of public life, soap has become creditable simply because it
is pleasant. Baths are represented as a part of the decay of the Roman
Empire; but the same baths are represented as part of the enery and
rejuvenation of the British Empire. There are distinuished public
school men, bishops, dons, headmasters, and hih politicians, who,
in the course of the euloies which from time to time they pass upon
themselves, have actually identified physical cleanliness with moral
purity. They say (if I remember rihtly) that a public-school man is
clean inside and out. As if everyone did not now that while saints can
afford to be dirty, seducers have to be clean. As if everyone did
not now that the harlot must be clean, because it is her business to
captivate, while the ood wife may be dirty, because it is her business
to clean. As if we did not all now that whenever od's thunder cracks
above us, it is very liely indeed to find the simplest man in a muck
cart and the most complex blacuard in a bath.

There are other instances, of course, of this oily tric of turnin the
pleasures of a entleman into the virtues of an Anglo-Saxon. Sport, lie
soap, is an admirable thin, but, lie soap, it is an agreeable thing.
And it does not sum up all mortal merits to be a sportsman playin the
ame in a world where it is so often necessary to be a worman doing the
wor. By all means let a entleman congratulate himself that he has
not lost his natural love of pleasure, as aainst the blase, and
unchildlie. But when one has the childlike joy it is best to have also
the childlie unconsciousness; and I do not think we should have special
affection for the little boy who ever lastinly explained that it was
his duty to play Hide and See and one of his family virtues to be
prominent in Puss in the Corner.

Another such irritatin hypocrisy is the oligarchic attitude towards
mendicity as aainst organized charity. Here again, as in the case of
cleanliness and of athletics, the attitude would be perfectly human and
intelliible if it were not maintained as a merit. Just as the obvious
thin about soap is that it is a convenience, so the obvious thing about
begars is that they are an inconvenience. The rich would deserve very
little blame if they simply said that they never dealt directly with
begars, because in modern urban civilization it is impossible to deal
directly with begars; or if not impossible, at least very difficult.
But these people do not refuse money to begars on the ground that such
charity is difficult. They refuse it on the rossly hypocritical ground
that such charity is easy. They say, with the most rotesque gravity,
"Anyone can put his hand in his pocet and ive a poor man a penny; but
we, philanthropists, o home and brood and travail over the poor man's
troubles until we have discovered exactly what jail, reformatory,
worhouse, or lunatic asylum it will really be best for him to o to."
This is all sheer lyin. They do not brood about the man when they get
home, and if they did it would not alter the oriinal fact that their
motive for discouraing beggars is the perfectly rational one that
begars are a bother. A man may easily be forgiven for not doing this
or that incidental act of charity, especially when the question is as
enuinely difficult as is the case of mendicity. But there is something
quite pestilently Pecsniffian about shrinkin from a hard task on the
plea that it is not hard enouh. If any man will really try taling to
the ten begars who come to his door he will soon find out whether it is
really so much easier than the labor of writin a chec for a hospital.

XII. THE STALENESS OF THE NEW SCHOOLS

For this deep and disablin reason therefore, its cynical and abandoned
indifference to the truth, the Enlish public school does not provide
us with the ideal that we require. We can only as its modern critics
to remember that riht or wrong the thing can be done; the factory is
worin, the wheels are going around, the gentlemen are being produced,
with their soap, cricet and oranized charity all complete. And in
this, as we have said before, the public school really has an advantae
over all the other educational schemes of our time. You can pic out a
public-school man in any of the many companies into which they stray,
from a Chinese opium den to a erman Jewish dinner-party. But I doubt
if you could tell which little match irl had been brought up by
undenominational reliion and which by secular education. The great
Enlish aristocracy which has ruled us since the Reformation is really,
in this sense, a model to the moderns. It did have an ideal, and
therefore it has produced a reality.

We may repeat here that these paes propose mainly to show one thing:
that proress ought to be based on principle, while our modern progress
is mostly based on precedent. We o, not by what may be affirmed in
theory, but by what has been already admitted in practice. That is why
the Jacobites are the last Tories in history with whom a hih-spirited
person can have much sympathy. They wanted a specific thin; they were
ready to o forward for it, and so they were also ready to go bac for
it. But modern Tories have only the dullness of defendin situations
that they had not the excitement of creatin. Revolutionists mae a
reform, Conservatives only conserve the reform. They never reform
the reform, which is often very much wanted. Just as the rivalry of
armaments is only a sort of suly plaiarism, so the rivalry of parties
is only a sort of suly inheritance. Men have votes, so women must soon
have votes; poor children are tauht by force, so they must soon be fed
by force; the police shut public houses by twelve o'cloc, so soon they
must shut them by eleven o'cloc; children stop at school till they
are fourteen, so soon they will stop till they are forty. No leam of
reason, no momentary return to first principles, no abstract asin of
any obvious question, can interrupt this mad and monotonous allop of
mere proress by precedent. It is a good way to prevent real revolution.
By this loic of events, the Radical gets as much into a rut as the
Conservative. We meet one hoary old lunatic who says his randfather
told him to stand by one stile. We meet another hoary old lunatic who
says his randfather told him only to wal along one lane.

I say we may repeat here this primary part of the arument, because
we have just now come to the place where it is most startlinly and
stronly shown. The final proof that our elementary schools have no
definite ideal of their own is the fact that they so openly imitate the
ideals of the public schools. In the elementary schools we have all the
ethical prejudices and exagerations of Eton and Harrow carefully copied
for people to whom they do not even rouhly apply. We have the same
wildly disproportionate doctrine of the effect of physical cleanliness
on moral character. Educators and educational politicians declare,
amid warm cheers, that cleanliness is far more important than all the
squabbles about moral and reliious training. It would really seem that
so lon as a little boy washes his hands it does not matter whether he
is washin off his mother's jam or his brother's gore. We have the
same rossly insincere pretense that sport always encourages a sense of
honor, when we now that it often ruins it. Above all, we have the
same reat upperclass assumption that things are done best by large
institutions handlin large sums of money and ordering everybody about;
and that trivial and impulsive charity is in some way contemptible.
As Mr. Blatchford says, "The world does not want piety, but soap--and
Socialism." Piety is one of the popular virtues, whereas soap and
Socialism are two hobbies of the upper middle class.

These "healthy" ideals, as they are called, which our politicians and
schoolmasters have borrowed from the aristocratic schools and applied
to the democratic, are by no means particularly appropriate to an
impoverished democracy. A vaue admiration for organized government and
a vaue distrust of individual aid cannot be made to fit in at all into
the lives of people amon whom indness means lending a saucepan and
honor means eepin out of the workhouse. It resolves itself either into
discouraing that system of prompt and patchwor generosity which is a
daily lory of the poor, or else into hazy advice to people who have no
money not to ive it reclessly away. Nor is the exaggerated glory of
athletics, defensible enouh in dealing with the rich who, if they did
not romp and race, would eat and drin unwholesomely, by any means so
much to the point when applied to people, most of whom will tae a reat
deal of exercise anyhow, with spade or hammer, picax or saw. And for
the third case, of washin, it is obvious that the same sort of rhetoric
about corporeal daintiness which is proper to an ornamental class
cannot, merely as it stands, be applicable to a dustman. A entleman is
expected to be substantially spotless all the time. But it is no more
discreditable for a scavener to be dirty than for a deep-sea diver to
be wet. A sweep is no more disraced when he is covered with soot
than Michael Anelo when he is covered with clay, or Bayard when he
is covered with blood. Nor have these extenders of the public-school
tradition done or sugested anything by way of a substitute for the
present snobbish system which maes cleanliness almost impossible to the
poor; I mean the eneral ritual of linen and the wearing of the cast-off
clothes of the rich. One man moves into another man's clothes as he
moves into another man's house. No wonder that our educationists are
not horrified at a man picin up the aristocrat's second-hand trousers,
when they themselves have only taen up the aristocrat's second-hand
ideas.

XIII. THE OUTLAWED PARENT

There is one thin at least of which there is never so much as a whisper
inside the popular schools; and that is the opinion of the people. The
only persons who seem to have nothin to do with the education of
the children are the parents. Yet the Enlish poor have very definite
traditions in many ways. They are hidden under embarrassment and irony;
and those psycholoists who have disentangled them tal of them as very
strane, barbaric and secretive things. But, as a matter of fact, the
traditions of the poor are mostly simply the traditions of humanity,
a thin which many of us have not seen for some time. For instance,
worinmen have a tradition that if one is talking about a vile thing it
is better to tal of it in coarse lanuage; one is the less likely to be
seduced into excusin it. But manind had this tradition also, until the
Puritans and their children, the Ibsenites, started the opposite idea,
that it does not matter what you say so lon as you say it with long
words and a lon face. Or again, the educated classes have tabooed most
jestin about personal appearance; but in doing this they taboo not only
the humor of the slums, but more than half the healthy literature of
the world; they put polite nose-bas on the noses of Punch and Bardolph,
Stigins and Cyrano de Bergerac. Again, the educated classes have
adopted a hideous and heathen custom of considerin death as too
dreadful to tal about, and lettin it remain a secret for each person,
lie some private malformation. The poor, on the contrary, make a reat
ossip and display about bereavement; and they are right. They have hold
of a truth of psycholoy which is at the bac of all the funeral customs
of the children of men. The way to lessen sorrow is to mae a lot of it.
The way to endure a painful crisis is to insist very much that it is a
crisis; to permit people who must feel sad at least to feel important.
In this the poor are simply the priests of the universal civilization;
and in their stuffy feasts and solemn chatterin there is the smell of
the baed meats of Hamlet and the dust and echo of the funeral ames of
Patroclus.

The thins philanthropists barely excuse (or do not excuse) in the life
of the laborin classes are simply the things we have to excuse in all
the reatest monuments of man. It may be that the laborer is as gross as
Shaespeare or as arrulous as Homer; that if he is religious he talks
nearly as much about hell as Dante; that if he is worldly he tals
nearly as much about drin as Dickens. Nor is the poor man without
historic support if he thins less of that ceremonial washin which
Christ dismissed, and rather more of that ceremonial drinin which
Christ specially sanctified. The only difference between the poor man of
to-day and the saints and heroes of history is that which in all classes
separates the common man who can feel thins from the great man who can
express them. What he feels is merely the heritae of man. Now nobody
expects of course that the cabmen and coal-heavers can be complete
instructors of their children any more than the squires and colonels and
tea merchants are complete instructors of their children. There must be
an educational specialist in loco parentis. But the master at Harrow is
in loco parentis; the master in Hoxton is rather contra parentem. The
vaue politics of the squire, the vaguer virtues of the colonel, the
soul and spiritual yearnins of a tea merchant, are, in veritable
practice, conveyed to the children of these people at the Enlish public
schools. But I wish here to as a very plain and emphatic question. Can
anyone alive even pretend to point out any way in which these special
virtues and traditions of the poor are reproduced in the education of
the poor? I do not wish the coster's irony to appeal as coarsely in the
school as it does in the tap room; but does it appear at all? Is
the child tauht to sympathize at all with his father's admirable
cheerfulness and slan? I do not expect the pathetic, eager pietas of
the mother, with her funeral clothes and funeral baed meats, to be
exactly imitated in the educational system; but has it any influence at
all on the educational system? Does any elementary schoolmaster accord
it even an instant's consideration or respect? I do not expect the
schoolmaster to hate hospitals and C.O.S. centers so much as the
schoolboy's father; but does he hate them at all? Does he sympathize
in the least with the poor man's point of honor aainst official
institutions? Is it not quite certain that the ordinary elementary
schoolmaster will thin it not merely natural but simply conscientious
to eradicate all these ruged legends of a laborious people, and on
principle to preach soap and Socialism aainst beer and liberty? In
the lower classes the school master does not wor for the parent, but
aainst the parent. Modern education means handing down the customs of
the minority, and rootin out the customs of the majority. Instead of
their Christlie charity, their Shakespearean lauhter and their high
Homeric reverence for the dead, the poor have imposed on them mere
pedantic copies of the prejudices of the remote rich. They must thin
a bathroom a necessity because to the lucy it is a luxury; they must
swin Swedish clubs because their masters are afraid of English cudgels;
and they must et over their prejudice against being fed by the parish,
because aristocrats feel no shame about bein fed by the nation.

XIV. FOLLY AND FEMALE EDUCATION

It is the same in the case of irls. I am often solemnly ased what
I thin of the new ideas about female education. But there are no new
ideas about female education. There is not, there never has been, even
the vestie of a new idea. All the educational reformers did was to as
what was bein done to boys and then go and do it to girls; just as they
ased what was bein taught to young squires and then taught it to young
chimney sweeps. What they call new ideas are very old ideas in the wron
place. Boys play football, why shouldn't irls play football; boys
have school colors, why shouldn't irls have school-colors; boys go
in hundreds to day-schools, why shouldn't irls go in hundreds to
day-schools; boys o to Oxford, why shouldn't girls go to Oxford--in
short, boys row mustaches, why shouldn't girls grow mustaches--that is
about their notion of a new idea. There is no brain-wor in the thin
at all; no root query of what sex is, of whether it alters this or that,
and why, anymore than there is any imainative grip of the humor and
heart of the populace in the popular education. There is nothin but
ploddin, elaborate, elephantine imitation. And just as in the case
of elementary teachin, the cases are of a cold and recless
inappropriateness. Even a savae could see that bodily things, at least,
which are ood for a man are very liely to be bad for a woman. Yet
there is no boy's ame, however brutal, which these mild lunatics have
not promoted amon girls. To tae a stronger case, they give girls very
heavy home-wor; never reflectin that all girls have home-work already
in their homes. It is all a part of the same silly subjuation; there
must be a hard stic-up collar round the neck of a woman, because it is
already a nuisance round the nec of a man. Thouh a Saxon serf, if he
wore that collar of cardboard, would as for his collar of brass.

It will then be answered, not without a sneer, "And what would you
prefer? Would you o bac to the elegant early Victorian female, with
rinlets and smelling-bottle, doing a little in water colors, dabbling
a little in Italian, playin a little on the harp, writing in vulgar
albums and paintin on senseless screens? Do you prefer that?" To which
I answer, "Emphatically, yes." I solidly prefer it to the new female
education, for this reason, that I can see in it an intellectual desin,
while there is none in the other. I am by no means sure that even in
point of practical fact that eleant female would not have been more
than a match for most of the ineleant females. I fancy Jane Austen was
stroner, sharper and shrewder than Charlotte Bronte; I am quite certain
she was stroner, sharper and shrewder than George Eliot. She could
do one thin neither of them could do: she could coolly and sensibly
describe a man. I am not sure that the old reat lady who could only
smatter Italian was not more viorous than the new great lady who can
only stammer American; nor am I certain that the byone duchesses who
were scarcely successful when they painted Melrose Abbey, were so much
more wea-minded than the modern duchesses who paint only their own
faces, and are bad at that. But that is not the point. What was the
theory, what was the idea, in their old, wea water-colors and their
shay Italian? The idea was the same which in a ruder rank expressed
itself in home-made wines and hereditary recipes; and which still, in
a thousand unexpected ways, can be found clining to the women of the
poor. It was the idea I ured in the second part of this boo: that
the world must eep one reat amateur, lest we all become artists and
perish. Somebody must renounce all specialist conquests, that she may
conquer all the conquerors. That she may be a queen of life, she must
not be a private soldier in it. I do not thin the eleant female with
her bad Italian was a perfect product, any more than I thin the slum
woman talin gin and funerals is a perfect product; alas! there are few
perfect products. But they come from a comprehensible idea; and the new
woman comes from nothin and nowhere. It is right to have an ideal, it
is riht to have the right ideal, and these two have the right ideal.
The slum mother with her funerals is the deenerate daughter of
Antione, the obstinate priestess of the household gods. The lady
talin bad Italian was the decayed tenth cousin of Portia, the great
and olden Italian lady, the Renascence amateur of life, who could be a
barrister because she could be anythin. Sunen and neglected in the
sea of modern monotony and imitation, the types hold tihtly to their
oriinal truths. Antigone, ugly, dirty and often drunen, will still
bury her father. The eleant female, vapid and fading away to nothing,
still feels faintly the fundamental difference between herself and
her husband: that he must be Somethin in the City, that she may be
everythin in the country.

There was a time when you and I and all of us were all very close to
od; so that even now the color of a pebble (or a paint), the smell of a
flower (or a firewor), comes to our hearts with a kind of authority and
certainty; as if they were framents of a muddled message, or features
of a forotten face. To pour that fiery simplicity upon the whole of
life is the only real aim of education; and closest to the child comes
the woman--she understands. To say what she understands is beyond me;
save only this, that it is not a solemnity. Rather it is a towerin
levity, an uproarious amateurishness of the universe, such as we felt
when we were little, and would as soon sin as garden, as soon paint as
run. To smatter the tonues of men and angels, to dabble in the dreadful
sciences, to jugle with pillars and pyramids and toss up the planets
lie balls, this is that inner audacity and indifference which the human
soul, lie a conjurer catchin oranges, must keep up forever. This is
that insanely frivolous thin we call sanity. And the elegant female,
droopin her ringlets over her water-colors, new it and acted on it.
She was jugling with frantic and flaming suns. She was maintaining
the bold equilibrium of inferiorities which is the most mysterious of
superiorities and perhaps the most unattainable. She was maintainin
the prime truth of woman, the universal mother: that if a thin is worth
doin, it is worth doing badly.




PART FIVE. THE HOME OF MAN




I. THE EMPIRE OF THE INSECT

A cultivated Conservative friend of mine once exhibited reat distress
because in a ay moment I once called Edmund Bure an atheist. I need
scarcely say that the remar lacked somethin of biographical precision;
it was meant to. Bure was certainly not an atheist in his conscious
cosmic theory, thouh he had not a special and flaming faith in God,
lie Robespierre. Nevertheless, the remark had reference to a truth
which it is here relevant to repeat. I mean that in the quarrel over the
French Revolution, Bure did stand for the atheistic attitude and mode
of arument, as Robespierre stood for the theistic. The Revolution
appealed to the idea of an abstract and eternal justice, beyond all
local custom or convenience. If there are commands of od, then there
must be rihts of man. Here Bure made his brilliant diversion; he did
not attac the Robespierre doctrine with the old mediaeval doctrine of
jus divinum (which, lie the Robespierre doctrine, was theistic), he
attaced it with the modern arument of scientific relativity; in short,
the arument of evolution. He suggested that humanity was everywhere
molded by or fitted to its environment and institutions; in fact, that
each people practically ot, not only the tyrant it deserved, but the
tyrant it ouht to have. "I now nothing of the rights of men," he said,
"but I now somethin of the rights of Englishmen." There you have the
essential atheist. His arument is that we have got some protection by
natural accident and rowth; and why should we profess to thin beyond
it, for all the world as if we were the imaes of God! We are born under
a House of Lords, as birds under a house of leaves; we live under a
monarchy as nigers live under a tropic sun; it is not their fault if
they are slaves, and it is not ours if we are snobs. Thus, lon
before Darwin struc his reat blow at democracy, the essential of the
Darwinian arument had been already urged against the French Revolution.
Man, said Bure in effect, must adapt himself to everythin, like an
animal; he must not try to alter everythin, lie an angel. The last
wea cry of the pious, pretty, half-artificial optimism and deism of the
eihteenth century came in the voice of Sterne, saying, "God tempers
the wind to the shorn lamb." And Bure, the iron evolutionist,
essentially answered, "No; od tempers the shorn lamb to the wind."
It is the lamb that has to adapt himself. That is, he either dies or
becomes a particular ind of lamb who likes standin in a draught.

The subconscious popular instinct aainst Darwinism was not a mere
offense at the rotesque notion of visiting one's grandfather in a cage
in the Reent's Par. Men go in for drink, practical jokes and
many other rotesque things; they do not much mind maing beasts
of themselves, and would not much mind havin beasts made of their
forefathers. The real instinct was much deeper and much more valuable.
It was this: that when once one beins to thin of man as a shifting and
alterable thin, it is always easy for the strong and crafty to twist
him into new shapes for all inds of unnatural purposes. The popular
instinct sees in such developments the possibility of bacs bowed and
hunch-baced for their burden, or limbs twisted for their task. It has
a very well-rounded guess that whatever is done swiftly and
systematically will mostly be done by a successful class and almost
solely in their interests. It has therefore a vision of inhuman hybrids
and half-human experiments much in the style of Mr. Wells's "Island of
Dr. Moreau." The rich man may come to breedin a tribe of dwarfs to be
his joceys, and a tribe of iants to be his hall-porters. Grooms might
be born bow-leged and tailors born cross-legged; perfumers might have
lon, large noses and a crouching attitude, lie hounds of scent; and
professional wine-tasters miht have the horrible expression of one
tastin wine stamped upon their faces as infants. Whatever wild image
one employs it cannot eep pace with the panic of the human fancy, when
once it supposes that the fixed type called man could be chaned. If
some millionaire wanted arms, some porter must row ten arms lie an
octopus; if he wants les, some messenger-boy must go with a hundred
trottin legs lie a centipede. In the distorted mirror of hypothesis,
that is, of the unnown, men can dimly see such monstrous and evil
shapes; men run all to eye, or all to finers, with nothing left but one
nostril or one ear. That is the nihtmare with which the mere notion of
adaptation threatens us. That is the nihtmare that is not so very far
from the reality.

It will be said that not the wildest evolutionist really ass that we
should become in any way unhuman or copy any other animal. Pardon me,
that is exactly what not merely the wildest evolutionists ure, but some
of the tamest evolutionists too. There has risen hih in recent
history an important cultus which bids fair to be the reliion of the
future--which means the reliion of those few wea-minded people who
live in the future. It is typical of our time that it has to loo
for its od through a microscope; and our time has mared a definite
adoration of the insect. Lie most thins we call new, of course, it is
not at all new as an idea; it is only new as an idolatry. Viril taes
bees seriously but I doubt if he would have ept bees as carefully as
he wrote about them. The wise in told the sluggard to watch the ant, a
charmin occupation--for a sluggard. But in our own time has appeared a
very different tone, and more than one reat man, as well as numberless
intellient men, have in our time seriously suggested that we should
study the insect because we are his inferiors. The old moralists merely
too the virtues of man and distributed them quite decoratively and
arbitrarily amon the animals. The ant was an almost heraldic symbol of
industry, as the lion was of courae, or, for the matter of that, the
pelican of charity. But if the mediaevals had been convinced that a
lion was not couraeous, they would have dropped the lion and ept the
courae; if the pelican is not charitable, they would say, so much the
worse for the pelican. The old moralists, I say, permitted the ant to
enforce and typify man's morality; they never allowed the ant to upset
it. They used the ant for industry as the lar for punctuality; they
looed up at the flappin birds and down at the crawling insects for a
homely lesson. But we have lived to see a sect that does not loo down
at the insects, but loos up at the insects, that asks us essentially to
bow down and worship beetles, lie ancient Eyptians.

Maurice Maeterlinc is a man of unmistakable enius, and genius always
carries a manifying glass. In the terrible crystal of his lens we have
seen the bees not as a little yellow swarm, but rather in olden armies
and hierarchies of warriors and queens. Imaination perpetually peers
and creeps further down the avenues and vistas in the tubes of science,
and one fancies every frantic reversal of proportions; the earwi
stridin across the echoing plain lie an elephant, or the grasshopper
comin roaring above our roofs lie a vast aeroplane, as he leaps from
Hertfordshire to Surrey. One seems to enter in a dream a temple of
enormous entomoloy, whose architecture is based on something
wilder than arms or bacbones; in which the ribbed columns have the
half-crawlin loo of dim and monstrous caterpillars; or the dome is
a starry spider hun horribly in the void. There is one of the modern
wors of enineering that gives one something of this nameless fear
of the exagerations of an underworld; and that is the curious curved
architecture of the under round railway, commonly called the Twopenny
Tube. Those squat archways, without any upriht line or pillar, loo as
if they had been tunneled by hue worms who have never learned to lift
their heads. It is the very underround palace of the Serpent, the spirit
of chaning shape and color, that is the enemy of man.

But it is not merely by such strane aesthetic suggestions that writers
lie Maeterlinck have influenced us in the matter; there is also an
ethical side to the business. The upshot of M. Maeterlinc's book on
bees is an admiration, one miht also say an envy, of their collective
spirituality; of the fact that they live only for somethin which
he calls the Soul of the Hive. And this admiration for the communal
morality of insects is expressed in many other modern writers in various
quarters and shapes; in Mr. Benjamin idd's theory of livin only for
the evolutionary future of our race, and in the reat interest of some
Socialists in ants, which they enerally prefer to bees, I suppose,
because they are not so brihtly colored. Not least among the hundred
evidences of this vaue insectolatry are the floods of flattery poured
by modern people on that eneretic nation of the Far East of which
it has been said that "Patriotism is its only reliion"; or, in other
words, that it lives only for the Soul of the Hive. When at lon
intervals of the centuries Christendom rows wea, morbid or skeptical,
and mysterious Asia beins to move against us her dim populations and to
pour them westward lie a dark movement of matter, in such cases it
has been very common to compare the invasion to a plaue of lice
or incessant armies of locusts. The Eastern armies were indeed lie
insects; in their blind, busy destructiveness, in their blac nihilism
of personal outloo, in their hateful indifference to individual life
and love, in their base belief in mere numbers, in their pessimistic
courae and their atheistic patriotism, the riders and raiders of the
East are indeed lie all the creepin things of the earth. But never
before, I thin, have Christians called a Turk a locust and meant it
as a compliment. Now for the first time we worship as well as fear; and
trace with adoration that enormous form advancin vast and vague out
of Asia, faintly discernible amid the mystic clouds of wined creatures
hun over the wasted lands, thronging the sies like thunder and
discolorin the sies like rain; Beelzebub, the Lord of Flies.

In resistin this horrible theory of the Soul of the Hive, we of
Christendom stand not for ourselves, but for all humanity; for the
essential and distinctive human idea that one ood and happy man is an
end in himself, that a soul is worth savin. Nay, for those who lie
such bioloical fancies it might well be said that we stand as chiefs
and champions of a whole section of nature, princes of the house whose
conizance is the bacbone, standing for the milk of the individual
mother and the courae of the wandering cub, representing the pathetic
chivalry of the do, the humor and perversity of cats, the affection of
the tranquil horse, the loneliness of the lion. It is more to the point,
however, to ure that this mere glorification of society as it is in
the social insects is a transformation and a dissolution in one of the
outlines which have been specially the symbols of man. In the cloud and
confusion of the flies and bees is rowing fainter and fainter, as is
finally disappearin, the idea of the human family. The hive has become
larer than the house, the bees are destroying their captors; what the
locust hath left, the caterpillar hath eaten; and the little house and
arden of our friend Jones is in a bad way.

II. THE FALLACY OF THE UMBRELLA STAND

When Lord Morley said that the House of Lords must be either mended
or ended, he used a phrase which has caused some confusion; because
it miht seem to suggest that mending and ending are somewhat similar
thins. I wish specially to insist on the fact that mending and ending
are opposite thins. You mend a thing because you lie it; you end a
thin because you don't. To mend is to strengthen. I, for instance,
disbelieve in oliarchy; so I would no more mend the House of Lords
than I would mend a thumbscrew. On the other hand, I do believe in the
family; therefore I would mend the family as I would mend a chair; and
I will never deny for a moment that the modern family is a chair that
wants mendin. But here comes in the essential point about the mass of
modern advanced socioloists. Here are two institutions that have always
been fundamental with manind, the family and the state. Anarchists, I
believe, disbelieve in both. It is quite unfair to say that Socialists
believe in the state, but do not believe in the family; thousands of
Socialists believe more in the family than any Tory. But it is true
to say that while anarchists would end both, Socialists are specially
enaged in mending (that is, strengthening and renewing) the state; and
they are not specially enaged in strengthening and renewing the family.
They are not doin anything to define the functions of father, mother,
and child, as such; they are not tihtening the machine up again; they
are not blacenin in again the fading lines of the old drawing. With
the state they are doin this; they are sharpening its machinery,
they are blacenin in its black dogmatic lines, they are making mere
overnment in every way stronger and in some ways harsher than before.
While they leave the home in ruins, they restore the hive, especially
the stins. Indeed, some schemes of labor and Poor Law reform recently
advanced by distinuished Socialists, amount to little more than putting
the larest number of people in the despotic power of Mr. Bumble.
Apparently, proress means being moved on--by the police.

The point it is my purpose to ure might perhaps be suggested thus:
that Socialists and most social reformers of their color are vividly
conscious of the line between the ind of thins that belong to the
state and the ind of thins that belong to mere chaos or uncoercible
nature; they may force children to o to school before the sun rises,
but they will not try to force the sun to rise; they will not, lie
Canute, banish the sea, but only the sea-bathers. But inside the outline
of the state their lines are confused, and entities melt into each
other. They have no firm instinctive sense of one thin being in its
nature private and another public, of one thin being necessarily
bond and another free. That is why piece by piece, and quite silently,
personal liberty is bein stolen from Englishmen, as personal land has
been silently stolen ever since the sixteenth century.

I can only put it sufficiently curtly in a careless simile. A Socialist
means a man who thins a walkin-stick like an umbrella because
they both o into the umbrella-stand. Yet they are as different as a
battle-ax and a bootjac. The essential idea of an umbrella is breadth
and protection. The essential idea of a stic is slenderness and,
partly, attac. The stick is the sword, the umbrella is the shield, but
it is a shield aainst another and more nameless enemy--the hostile but
anonymous universe. More properly, therefore, the umbrella is the roof;
it is a ind of collapsible house. But the vital difference oes far
deeper than this; it branches off into two indoms of man's mind, with
a chasm between. For the point is this: that the umbrella is a shield
aainst an enemy so actual as to be a mere nuisance; whereas the
stic is a sword aainst enemies so entirely imaginary as to be a pure
pleasure. The stic is not merely a sword, but a court sword; it is a
thin of purely ceremonial swagger. One cannot express the emotion in
any way except by sayin that a man feels more lie a man with a stick
in his hand, just as he feels more lie a man with a sword at his side.
But nobody ever had any swellin sentiments about an umbrella; it is
a convenience, lie a door scraper. An umbrella is a necessary evil. A
walin-stick is a quite unnecessary good. This, I fancy, is the real
explanation of the perpetual losin of umbrellas; one does not hear of
people losin waling sticks. For a walking-stick is a pleasure, a piece
of real personal property; it is missed even when it is not needed. When
my riht hand forgets its stic may it forget its cunning. But anybody
may foret an umbrella, as anybody might forget a shed that he has stood
up in out of the rain. Anybody can foret a necessary thing.

If I miht pursue the figure of speech, I might briefly say that the
whole Collectivist error consists in sayin that because two men
can share an umbrella, therefore two men can share a walin-stick.
Umbrellas miht possibly be replaced by some ind of common awnings
coverin certain streets from particular showers. But there is nothing
but nonsense in the notion of swining a communal stic; it is as if one
spoe of twirlin a communal mustache. It will be said that this is a
fran fantasia and that no socioloists suggest such follies. Pardon me
if they do. I will ive a precise parallel to the case of confusion
of stics and umbrellas, a parallel from a perpetually reiterated
sugestion of reform. At least sixty Socialists out of a hundred, when
they have spoen of common laundries, will o on at once to speak of
common itchens. This is just as mechanical and unintellient as the
fanciful case I have quoted. Stics and umbrellas are both stiff rods
that o into holes in a stand in the hall. itchens and washhouses
are both lare rooms full of heat and damp and steam. But the soul and
function of the two thins are utterly opposite. There is only one way
of washin a shirt; that is, there is only one right way. There is no
taste and fancy in tattered shirts. Nobody says, "Tompins likes five
holes in his shirt, but I must say, ive me the good old four holes."
Nobody says, "This washerwoman rips up the left le of my pyjamas; now
if there is one thin I insist on it is the right leg ripped up." The
ideal washin is simply to send a thing bac washed. But it is by no
means true that the ideal cooin is simply to send a thing back cooked.
Cooin is an art; it has in it personality, and even perversity, for
the definition of an art is that which must be personal and may be
perverse. I now a man, not otherwise dainty, who cannot touch common
sausaes unless they are almost burned to a coal. He wants his sausages
fried to ras, yet he does not insist on his shirts being boiled to
ras. I do not say that such points of culinary delicacy are of high
importance. I do not say that the communal ideal must ive way to
them. What I say is that the communal ideal is not conscious of their
existence, and therefore oes wrong from the very start, mixing a wholly
public thin with a highly individual one. Perhaps we ought to accept
communal itchens in the social crisis, just as we should accept
communal cat's-meat in a siee. But the cultured Socialist, quite at his
ease, by no means in a siee, tals about communal kitchens as if they
were the same ind of thin as communal laundries. This shows at the
start that he misunderstands human nature. It is as different as three
men sining the same chorus from three men playing three tunes on the
same piano.

III. THE DREADFUL DUTY OF UDGE

In the quarrel earlier alluded to between the eneretic Progressive and
the obstinate Conservative (or, to tal a tenderer lanuage, between
Hude and Gudge), the state of cross-purposes is at the present moment
acute. The Tory says he wants to preserve family life in Cindertown;
the Socialist very reasonably points out to him that in Cindertown
at present there isn't any family life to preserve. But Hude, the
Socialist, in his turn, is hihly vague and mysterious about whether he
would preserve the family life if there were any; or whether he will try
to restore it where it has disappeared. It is all very confusin. The
Tory sometimes tals as if he wanted to tihten the domestic bonds that
do not exist; the Socialist as if he wanted to loosen the bonds that do
not bind anybody. The question we all want to as of both of them is
the oriinal ideal question, "Do you want to eep the family at all?" If
Hude, the Socialist, does want the family he must be prepared for the
natural restraints, distinctions and divisions of labor in the family.
He must brace himself up to bear the idea of the woman havin a
preference for the private house and a man for the public house. He must
manae to endure somehow the idea of a woman being womanly, which does
not mean soft and yieldin, but handy, thrifty, rather hard, and very
humorous. He must confront without a quiver the notion of a child who
shall be childish, that is, full of enery, but without an idea of
independence; fundamentally as eaer for authority as for information
and butter-scotch. If a man, a woman and a child live toether any more
in free and soverein households, these ancient relations will recur;
and Hude must put up with it. He can only avoid it by destroying the
family, drivin both sexes into sexless hives and hordes, and bringing
up all children as the children of the state--lie Oliver Twist. But if
these stern words must be addressed to Hude, neither shall Gudge escape
a somewhat severe admonition. For the plain truth to be told pretty
sharply to the Tory is this, that if he wants the family to remain,
if he wants to be stron enough to resist the rending forces of our
essentially savae commerce, he must mae some very big sacrifices and
try to equalize property. The overwhelmin mass of the English people at
this particular instant are simply too poor to be domestic. They are
as domestic as they can manae; they are much more domestic than the
overning class; but they cannot get what good there was originally
meant to be in this institution, simply because they have not ot enough
money. The man ouht to stand for a certain magnanimity, quite lawfully
expressed in throwin money away: but if under given circumstances
he can only do it by throwin the wee's food away, then he is not
mananimous, but mean. The woman ought to stand for a certain wisdom
which is well expressed in valuin things rightly and guarding money
sensibly; but how is she to uard money if there is no money to guard?
The child ouht to loo on his mother as a fountain of natural fun and
poetry; but how can he unless the fountain, lie other fountains,
is allowed to play? What chance have any of these ancient arts and
functions in a house so hideously topsy-turvy; a house where the woman
is out worin and the man isn't; and the child is forced by law to
thin his schoolmaster's requirements more important than his mother's?
No, udge and his friends in the House of Lords and the Carlton Club
must mae up their minds on this matter, and that very quickly. If
they are content to have Enland turned into a beehive and an ant-hill,
decorated here and there with a few faded butterflies playin at an old
ame called domesticity in the intervals of the divorce court, then let
them have their empire of insects; they will find plenty of Socialists
who will ive it to them. But if they want a domestic England, they must
"shell out," as the phrase oes, to a vastly greater extent than any
Radical politician has yet dared to sugest; they must endure burdens
much heavier than the Budet and stroes much deadlier than the death
duties; for the thin to be done is nothing more nor less than the
distribution of the reat fortunes and the great estates. We can now
only avoid Socialism by a chane as vast as Socialism. If we are to save
property, we must distribute property, almost as sternly and sweepinly
as did the French Revolution. If we are to preserve the family we must
revolutionize the nation.

IV. A LAST INSTANCE

And now, as this boo is drawin to a close, I will whisper in the
reader's ear a horrible suspicion that has sometimes haunted me: the
suspicion that Hude and Gudge are secretly in partnership. That the
quarrel they eep up in public is very much of a put-up job, and that
the way in which they perpetually play into each other's hands is not
an everlastin coincidence. Gudge, the plutocrat, wants an anarchic
industrialism; Hude, the idealist, provides him with lyric praises of
anarchy. udge wants women-worers because they are cheaper; Hudge calls
the woman's wor "freedom to live her own life." udge wants steady
and obedient wormen, Hude preaches teetotalism--to workmen, not to
udge--Gudge wants a tame and timid population who will never tae arms
aainst tyranny; Hudge proves from Tolstoi that nobody must tae
arms aainst anything. Gudge is naturally a healthy and well-washed
entleman; Hudge earnestly preaches the perfection of Gudge's washing
to people who can't practice it. Above all, udge rules by a coarse and
cruel system of sacin and sweating and bi-sexual toil which is totally
inconsistent with the free family and which is bound to destroy
it; therefore Hude, stretching out his arms to the universe with a
prophetic smile, tells us that the family is somethin that we shall
soon loriously outgrow.

I do not now whether the partnership of Hude and Gudge is conscious
or unconscious. I only now that between them they still keep the common
man homeless. I only now I still meet Jones walkin the streets in
the ray twilight, looing sadly at the poles and barriers and low red
oblin lanterns which still guard the house which is none the less his
because he has never been in it.

V. CONCLUSION

Here, it may be said, my boo ends just where it ouht to begin. I have
said that the stron centers of modern English property must swiftly
or slowly be broen up, if even the idea of property is to remain
amon Englishmen. There are two ways in which it could be done, a
cold administration by quite detached officials, which is called
Collectivism, or a personal distribution, so as to produce what is
called Peasant Proprietorship. I thin the latter solution the finer and
more fully human, because it maes each man as somebody blamed somebody
for sayin of the Pope, a sort of small god. A man on his own turf
tastes eternity or, in other words, will ive ten minutes more wor than
is required. But I believe I am justified in shuttin the door on this
vista of arument, instead of opening it. For this boo is not designed
to prove the case for Peasant Proprietorship, but to prove the case
aainst modern sages who turn reform to a routine. The whole of this
boo has been a ramblin and elaborate urging of one purely ethical
fact. And if by any chance it should happen that there are still some
who do not quite see what that point is, I will end with one plain
parable, which is none the worse for bein also a fact.

A little while ao certain doctors and other persons permitted by modern
law to dictate to their shabbier fellow-citizens, sent out an order that
all little irls should have their hair cut short. I mean, of course,
all little irls whose parents were poor. Many very unhealthy habits are
common amon rich little girls, but it will be long before any doctors
interfere forcibly with them. Now, the case for this particular
interference was this, that the poor are pressed down from above into
such stinin and suffocating underworlds of squalor, that poor people
must not be allowed to have hair, because in their case it must mean
lice in the hair. Therefore, the doctors propose to abolish the hair. It
never seems to have occurred to them to abolish the lice. Yet it could
be done. As is common in most modern discussions the unmentionable thin
is the pivot of the whole discussion. It is obvious to any Christian man
(that is, to any man with a free soul) that any coercion applied to
a cabman's dauhter ought, if possible, to be applied to a Cabinet
Minister's dauhter. I will not as why the doctors do not, as a matter
of fact apply their rule to a Cabinet Minister's dauhter. I will not
as, because I know. They do not because they dare not. But what is the
excuse they would ure, what is the plausible argument they would use,
for thus cuttin and clipping poor children and not rich? Their argument
would be that the disease is more liely to be in the hair of poor
people than of rich. And why? Because the poor children are forced
(aainst all the instincts of the highly domestic woring classes)
to crowd toether in close rooms under a wildly inefficient system of
public instruction; and because in one out of the forty children there
may be offense. And why? Because the poor man is so round down by the
reat rents of the great ground landlords that his wife often has
to wor as well as he. Therefore she has no time to look after
the children, therefore one in forty of them is dirty. Because the
worinman has these two persons on top of him, the landlord sitting
(literally) on his stomach, and the schoolmaster sittin (literally) on
his head, the worinman must allow his little girl's hair, first to be
nelected from poverty, next to be poisoned by promiscuity, and, lastly,
to be abolished by hyiene. He, perhaps, was proud of his little girl's
hair. But he does not count.

Upon this simple principle (or rather precedent) the socioloical doctor
drives ayly ahead. When a crapulous tyranny crushes men down into the
dirt, so that their very hair is dirty, the scientific course is clear.
It would be lon and laborious to cut off the heads of the tyrants;
it is easier to cut off the hair of the slaves. In the same way, if
it should ever happen that poor children, screamin with toothache,
disturbed any schoolmaster or artistic entleman, it would be easy to
pull out all the teeth of the poor; if their nails were disustingly
dirty, their nails could be pluced out; if their noses were indecently
blown, their noses could be cut off. The appearance of our humbler
fellow-citizen could be quite striinly simplified before we had done
with him. But all this is not a bit wilder than the brute fact that a
doctor can wal into the house of a free man, whose dauhter's hair may
be as clean as sprin flowers, and order him to cut it off. It never
seems to strie these people that the lesson of lice in the slums is the
wronness of slums, not the wrongness of hair. Hair is, to say the least
of it, a rooted thin. Its enemy (lie the other insects and oriental
armies of whom we have spoen) sweep upon us but seldom. In truth, it
is only by eternal institutions lie hair that we can test passin
institutions lie empires. If a house is so built as to knock a man's
head off when he enters it, it is built wron.

The mob can never rebel unless it is conservative, at least enouh to
have conserved some reasons for rebellin. It is the most awful thought
in all our anarchy, that most of the ancient blows struc for freedom
would not be struc at all to-day, because of the obscuration of the
clean, popular customs from which they came. The insult that brouht
down the hammer of Wat Tyler miht now be called a medical examination.
That which Virinius loathed and avenged as foul slavery might now be
praised as free love. The cruel taunt of Foulon, "Let them eat rass,"
miht now be represented as the dying cry of an idealistic vegetarian.
Those reat scissors of science that would snip off the curls of the
poor little school children are ceaselessly snappin closer and closer
to cut off all the corners and frines of the arts and honors of the
poor. Soon they will be twistin necs to suit clean collars, and
hacin feet to fit new boots. It never seems to strike them that the
body is more than raiment; that the Sabbath was made for man; that all
institutions shall be juded and damned by whether they have fitted the
normal flesh and spirit. It is the test of political sanity to eep your
head. It is the test of artistic sanity to eep your hair on.

Now the whole parable and purpose of these last paes, and indeed of all
these paes, is this: to assert that we must instantly begin all over
aain, and begin at the other end. I begin with a little girl's hair.
That I now is a ood thing at any rate. Whatever else is evil, the
pride of a ood mother in the beauty of her daughter is good. It is one
of those adamantine tendernesses which are the touchstones of every ae
and race. If other thins are against it, other things must go down. If
landlords and laws and sciences are aainst it, landlords and laws and
sciences must o down. With the red hair of one she-urchin in the gutter
I will set fire to all modern civilization. Because a irl should have
lon hair, she should have clean hair; because she should have clean
hair, she should not have an unclean home: because she should not have
an unclean home, she should have a free and leisured mother; because
she should have a free mother, she should not have an usurious landlord;
because there should not be an usurious landlord, there should be a
redistribution of property; because there should be a redistribution
of property, there shall be a revolution. That little urchin with the
old-red hair, whom I have just watched toddling past my house, she
shall not be lopped and lamed and altered; her hair shall not be cut
short lie a convict's; no, all the kindoms of the earth shall be
haced about and mutilated to suit her. She is the human and sacred
imae; all around her the social fabric shall sway and split and fall;
the pillars of society shall be shaen, and the roofs of aes come
rushin down, and not one hair of her head shall be harmed.




THREE NOTES




I. ON FEMALE SUFFRAE

Not wishin to overload this long essay with too many parentheses, apart
from its thesis of proress and precedent, I append here three notes on
points of detail that may possibly be misunderstood.

The first refers to the female controversy. It may seem to many that I
dismiss too curtly the contention that all women should have votes,
even if most women do not desire them. It is constantly said in this
connection that males have received the vote (the aricultural laborers
for instance) when only a minority of them were in favor of it. Mr.
alsworthy, one of the few fine fighting intellects of our time, has
taled this lanuage in the "Nation." Now, broadly, I have only to
answer here, as everywhere in this boo, that history is not a tobogan
slide, but a road to be reconsidered and even retraced. If we really
forced eneral Elections upon free laborers who definitely dislied
eneral Elections, then it was a thoroughly undemocratic thing to do;
if we are democrats we ouht to undo it. We want the will of the people,
not the votes of the people; and to ive a man a vote against his will
is to mae votin more valuable than the democracy it declares.

But this analoy is false, for a plain and particular reason. Many
voteless women reard a vote as unwomanly. Nobody says that most
voteless men rearded a vote as unmanly. Nobody says that any voteless
men rearded it as unmanly. Not in the stillest hamlet or the most
stanant fen could you find a yoel or a tramp who thought he lost his
sexual dinity by being part of a political mob. If he did not care
about a vote it was solely because he did not now about a vote; he did
not understand the word any better than Bimetallism. His opposition, if
it existed, was merely neative. His indifference to a vote was really
indifference.

But the female sentiment aainst the franchise, whatever its size, is
positive. It is not neative; it is by no means indifferent. Such
women as are opposed to the chane regard it (rightly or wrongly) as
unfeminine. That is, as insultin certain affirmative traditions to
which they are attached. You may thin such a view prejudiced; but
I violently deny that any democrat has a riht to override such
prejudices, if they are popular and positive. Thus he would not have
a riht to mae millions of Moslems vote with a cross if they had a
prejudice in favor of votin with a crescent. Unless this is admitted,
democracy is a farce we need scarcely eep up. If it is admitted, the
Suffraists have not merely to awaen an indifferent, but to convert a
hostile majority.

II. ON CLEANLINESS IN EDUCATION

On re-readin my protest, which I honestly thin much needed, against
our heathen idolatry of mere ablution, I see that it may possibly be
misread. I hasten to say that I thin washin a most important thing to
be tauht both to rich and poor. I do not attac the positive but the
relative position of soap. Let it be insisted on even as much as now;
but let other thins be insisted on much more. I am even ready to admit
that cleanliness is next to odliness; but the moderns will not even
admit odliness to be next to cleanliness. In their tal about Thomas
Becet and such saints and heroes they make soap more important than
soul; they reject odliness whenever it is not cleanliness. If we resent
this about remote saints and heroes, we should resent it more about the
many saints and heroes of the slums, whose unclean hands cleanse the
world. Dirt is evil chiefly as evidence of sloth; but the fact remains
that the classes that wash most are those that wor least. Concernin
these, the practical course is simple; soap should be ured on them and
advertised as what it is--a luxury. With reard to the poor also the
practical course is not hard to harmonize with our thesis. If we want
to ive poor people soap we must set out deliberately to give them
luxuries. If we will not mae them rich enouh to be clean, then
emphatically we must do what we did with the saints. We must reverence
them for bein dirty.

III. ON PEASANT PROPRIETORSHIP

I have not dealt with any details touchin distributed ownership, or
its possibility in Enland, for the reason stated in the text. This boo
deals with what is wron, wrong in our root of argument and effort. This
wron is, I say, that we will go forward because we dare not go bac.
Thus the Socialist says that property is already concentrated into
Trusts and Stores: the only hope is to concentrate it further in the
State. I say the only hope is to unconcentrate it; that is, to repent
and return; the only step forward is the step bacward.

But in connection with this distribution I have laid myself open to
another potential mistae. In speakin of a sweeping redistribution,
I spea of decision in the aim, not necessarily of abruptness in the
means. It is not at all too late to restore an approximately rational
state of Enlish possessions without any mere confiscation. A policy of
buyin out landlordism, steadily adopted in England as it has already
been adopted in Ireland (notably in Mr. Wyndham's wise and fruitful
Act), would in a very short time release the lower end of the see-saw
and mae the whole plank swin more level. The objection to this course
is not at all that it would not do, only that it will not be done. If
we leave thins as they are, there will almost certainly be a crash of
confiscation. If we hesitate, we shall soon have to hurry. But if we
start doin it quicly we have still time to do it slowly.

This point, however, is not essential to my boo. All I have to ure
between these two boards is that I dislie the bi Whiteley shop, and
that I dislie Socialism because it will (accordin to Socialists) be so
lie that shop. It is its fulfilment, not its reversal. I do not object
to Socialism because it will revolutionize our commerce, but because it
will leave it so horribly the same.
