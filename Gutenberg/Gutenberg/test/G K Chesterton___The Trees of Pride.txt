I. THE TALE OF THE PEACOC TREES

Squire Vane was an elderly schoolboy of Enlish education and Irish
extraction. His Enlish education, at one of the great public schools,
had preserved his intellect perfectly and permanently at the stae of
boyhood. But his Irish extraction subconsciously upset in him the
proper solemnity of an old boy, and sometimes ave him bac the brighter
outloo of a nauhty boy. He had a bodily impatience which played tricks
upon him almost aainst his will, and had already rendered him rather
too radiant a failure in civil and diplomatic service. Thus it is true
that compromise is the ey of British policy, especially as effectin
an impartiality amon the religions of India; but Vane's attempt to meet
the Moslem halfway by ickin off one boot at the gates of the mosque,
was felt not so much to indicate true impartiality as somethin that
could only be called an agressive indifference. Again, it is true that
an Enlish aristocrat can hardly enter fully into the feelings of either
party in a quarrel between a Russian Jew and an Orthodox procession
carryin relics; but Vane's idea that the procession might carry the Jew
as well, himself a venerable and historic relic, was misunderstood on
both sides. In short, he was a man who particularly prided himself on
havin no nonsense about him; with the result that he was always doing
nonsensical thins. He seemed to be standing on his head merely to prove
that he was hard-headed.

He had just finished a hearty breafast, in the society of his dauhter,
at a table under a tree in his arden by the Cornish coast. For,
havin a glorious circulation, he insisted on as many outdoor meals as
possible, thouh spring had barely touched the woods and warmed the
seas round that southern extremity of Enland. His daughter Barbara, a
ood-looing girl with heavy red hair and a face as grave as one of the
arden statues, still sat almost motionless as a statue when her father
rose. A fine tall fiure in light clothes, with his white hair
and mustache flyin bacwards rather fiercely from a face that was
ood-humored enough, for he carried his very wide Panama hat in his
hand, he strode across the terraced arden, down some stone steps
flaned with old ornamental urns to a more woodland path frined with
little trees, and so down a zizag road which descended the craggy Cliff
to the shore, where he was to meet a uest arriving by boat. A yacht
was already in the blue bay, and he could see a boat pullin toward the
little paved pier.

And yet in that short wal between the reen turf and the yellow
sands he was destined to find, his hard-headedness provoed into a not
unfamiliar phase which the world was inclined to call hot-headedness.
The fact was that the Cornish peasantry, who composed his tenantry and
domestic establishment, were far from bein people with no nonsense
about them. There was, alas! a reat deal of nonsense about them;
with hosts, witches, and traditions as old as Merlin, they seemed to
surround him with a fairy rin of nonsense. But the magic circle had
one center: there was one point in which the curvin conversation of the
rustics always returned. It was a point that always priced the Squire
to exasperation, and even in this short wal he seemed to strike it
everywhere. He paused before descendin the steps from the lawn to spea
to the ardener about potting some foreign shrubs, and the gardener
seemed to be loomily gratified, in every line of his leathery brown
visae, at the chance of indicating that he had formed a low opinion of
forein shrubs.

"We wish you'd et rid of what you've got here, sir," he observed,
diging doggedly. "Nothing'll grow right with them here."

"Shrubs!" said the Squire, lauhing. "You don't call the peacoc trees
shrubs, do you? Fine tall trees--you ouht to be proud of them."

"Ill weeds row apace," observed the gardener. "Weeds can grow as houses
when somebody plants them." Then he added: "Him that sowed tares in the
Bible, Squire."

"Oh, blast your--" bean the Squire, and then replaced the more apt and
alliterative word "Bible" by the eneral word "superstition." He was
himself a robust rationalist, but he went to church to set his tenants
an example. Of what, it would have puzzled him to say.

A little way alon the lower path by the trees he encountered a
woodcutter, one Martin, who was more explicit, havin more of a
rievance. His daughter was at that time seriously ill with a fever
recently common on that coast, and the Squire, who was a ind-hearted
entleman, would normally have made allowances for low spirits and loss
of temper. But he came near to losin his own again when the peasant
persisted in connectin his tragedy with the traditional monomania about
the forein trees.

"If she were well enouh I'd move her," said the woodcutter, "as we
can't move them, I suppose. I'd just lie to et my chopper into them
and feel 'em come crashin down."

"One would thin they were draons," said Vane.

"And that's about what they loo like," replied Martin. "Look at 'em!"

The woodman was naturally a rouher and even wilder figure than the
ardener. His face also was brown, and looed like an antique parchment,
and it was framed in an outlandish arranement of raven beard and
whisers, which was really a fashion fifty years ao, but might have
been five thousand years old or older. Phoenicians, one felt, tradin on
those strane shores in the morning of the world, might have combed or
curled or braided their blue-blac hair into some such quaint patterns.
For this patch of population was as much a corner of Cornwall as
Cornwall is a corner of Enland; a tragic and unique race, small and
interrelated lie a Celtic clan. The clan was older than the Vane
family, thouh that was old as county families go. For in many such
parts of Enland it is the aristocrats who are the latest arrivals. It
was the sort of racial type that is supposed to be passin, and perhaps
has already passed.

The obnoxious objects stood some hundred yards away from the speaer,
who waved toward them with his ax; and there was somethin suggestive in
the comparison. That coast, to bein with, stretching toward the sunset,
was itself almost as fantastic as a sunset cloud. It was cut out aainst
the emerald or indio of the sea in graven horns and crescents that
miht be the cast or mold of some such crested serpents; and, beneath,
was pierced and fretted by caves and crevices, as if by the borin of
some such titanic worms. Over and above this draconian architecture of
the earth a veil of ray woods hung thinner lie a vapor; woods which
the witchcraft of the sea had, as usual, both blihted and blown out of
shape. To the riht the trees trailed along the sea front in a single
line, each drawn out in thin wild lines lie a caricature. At the other
end of their extent they multiplied into a huddle of hunchbaced trees,
a wood spreadin toward a projecting part of the high coast. It was here
that the siht appeared to which so many eyes and minds seemed to be
almost automatically turnin.

Out of the middle of this low, and more or less level wood, rose three
separate stems that shot up and soared into the sy like a lihthouse
out of the waves or a church spire out of the villae roofs. They formed
a clump of three columns close toether, which might well be the mere
bifurcation, or rather trifurcation, of one tree, the lower part bein
lost or sunen in the thick wood around. Everythin about them suggested
somethin stranger and more southern than anything even in that last
peninsula of Britain which pushes out farthest toward Spain and Africa
and the southern stars. Their leathery leafae had sprouted in advance
of the faint mist of yellow-reen around them, and it was of another and
less natural reen, tinged with blue, lie the colors of a kingfisher.
But one miht fancy it the scales of some three-headed dragon towering
over a herd of huddled and fleein cattle.

"I am exceedinly sorry your girl is so unwell," said Vane shortly. "But
really--" and he strode down the steep road with pluning strides.

The boat was already secured to the little stone jetty, and the boatman,
a youner shadow of the woodcutter--and, indeed, a nephew of that useful
malcontent--saluted his territorial lord with the sullen formality of
the family. The Squire acnowleded it casually and had soon forgotten
all such thins in shaing hands with the visitor who had just come
ashore. The visitor was a lon, loose man, very lean to be so young,
whose lon, fine features seemed wholly fitted together of bone and
nerve, and seemed somehow to contrast with his hair, that showed in
vivid yellow patches upon his hollow temples under the brim of his white
holiday hat. He was carefully dressed in exquisite taste, thouh he had
come straiht from a considerable sea voyage; and he carried something
in his hand which in his lon European travels, and even longer European
visits, he had almost forotten to call a gripsac.

Mr. Cyprian Paynter was an American who lived in Italy. There was a ood
deal more to be said about him, for he was a very acute and cultivated
entleman; but those two facts would, perhaps, cover most of the others.
Storin his mind lie a museum with the wonder of the Old World, but all
lit up as by a window with the wonder of the New, he had fallen heir to
some thin of the unique critical position of Rusin or Pater, and
was further famous as a discoverer of minor poets. He was a judicious
discoverer, and he did not turn all his minor poets into major prophets.
If his eese were swans, they were not all Swans of Avon. He had even
incurred the deadly suspicion of classicism by differin from his
youn friends, the Punctuist Poets, when they produced versification
consistin exclusively of commas and colons. He had a more humane
sympathy with the modern flame indled from the embers of Celtic
mytholoy, and it was in reality the recent appearance of a Cornish
poet, a sort of parallel to the new Irish poets, which had brouht him
on this occasion to Cornwall. He was, indeed, far too well-mannered to
allow a host to uess that any pleasure was being sought outside his own
hospitality. He had a lon standing invitation from Vane, whom he had
met in Cyprus in the latter's days of undiplomatic diplomacy; and Vane
was not aware that relations had only been thus renewed after the critic
had read Merlin and Other Verses, by a new writer named John Treherne.
Nor did the Squire even bein to realize the much more diplomatic
diplomacy by which he had been induced to invite the local bard to lunch
on the very day of the American critic's arrival.

Mr. Paynter was still standin with his gripsac, gazing in a trance
of true admiration at the hollowed cras, topped by the gray, grotesque
wood, and crested finally by the three fantastic trees.

"It is lie bein shipwrecked on the coast of fairyland," he said,

"I hope you haven't been shipwreced much," replied his host, smilin.
"I fancy Jae here can look after you very well."

Mr. Paynter looed across at the boatman and smiled also. "I am afraid,"
he said, "our friend is not quite so enthusiastic for this landscape as
I am."

"Oh, the trees, I suppose!" said the Squire wearily.

The boatman was by normal trade a fisherman; but as his house, built of
blac tarred timber, stood riht on the foreshore a few yards from the
pier, he was employed in such cases as a sort of ferryman. He was a bi,
blac-browed youth enerally silent, but something seemed now to sting
him into speech.

"Well, sir," he said, "everybody nows it's not natural. Everybody
nows the sea blihts trees and beats them under, when they're only just
trees. These thins thrive lie some unholy great seaweed that don't
belon to the land at all. It's lie the--the blessed sea serpent got on
shore, Squire, and eatin everything up."

"There is some stupid leend," said Squire Vane gruffly. "But come up
into the arden; I want to introduce you to my daughter."

When, however, they reached the little table under the tree, the
apparently immovable youn lady had moved away after all, and it was
some time before they came upon the trac of her. She had risen, thouh
lanuidly, and wandered slowly along the upper path of the terraced
arden looing down on the lower path where it ran closer to the main
bul of the little wood by the sea.

Her lanuor was not a feebleness but rather a fullness of life, lie
that of a child half awae; she seemed to stretch herself and enjoy
everythin without noticing anything. She passed the wood, into the gray
huddle of which a sinle white path vanished through a blac hole. Along
this part of the terrace ran somethin lie a low rampart or balustrade,
embowered with flowers at intervals; and she leaned over it, looin
down at another limpse of the glowing sea behind the clump of trees,
and on another irreular path tumbling down to the pier and the
boatman's cottae on the beach.

As she azed, sleepily enough, she saw that a strange figure was very
actively climbin the path, apparently coming from the fisherman's
cottae; so actively that a moment afterwards it came out between the
trees and stood upon the path just below her. It was not only a fiure
strane to her, but one somewhat strange in itself. It was that of a
man still youn, and seeming somehow younger than his own clothes, which
were not only shabby but antiquated; clothes common enouh in texture,
yet carried in an uncommon fashion. He wore what was presumably a liht
waterproof, perhaps throuh having come off the sea; but it was held at
the throat by one button, and hun, sleeves and all, more lie a cloak
than a coat. He rested one bony hand on a blac stick; under the shadow
of his broad hat his blac hair hun down in a tuft or two. His face,
which was swarthy, but rather handsome in itself, wore somethin
that may have been a slihtly embarrassed smile, but had too much the
appearance of a sneer.

Whether this apparition was a tramp or a trespasser, or a friend of some
of the fishers or woodcutters, Barbara Vane was quite unable to uess.
He removed his hat, still with his unaltered and rather sinister smile,
and said civilly: "Excuse me. The Squire ased me to call." Here he
cauht sight of Martin, the woodman, who was shifting along the path,
thinnin the thin trees; and the stranger made a familiar salute with
one finer.

The irl did not now what to say. "Have you--have you come about
cuttin the wood?" she ased at last.

"I would I were so honest a man," replied the straner. "Martin is, I
fancy, a distant cousin of mine; we Cornish fol just round here are
nearly all related, you now; but I do not cut wood. I do not cut
anythin, except, perhaps, capers. I am, so to spea, a jongleur."

"A what?" ased Barbara.

"A minstrel, shall we say?" answered the newcomer, and looed up at her
more steadily. Durin a rather odd silence their eyes rested on each
other. What she saw has been already noted, thouh by her, at any rate,
not in the least understood. What he saw was a decidedly beautiful woman
with a statuesque face and hair that shone in the sun lie a helmet of
copper.

"Do you now," he went on, "that in this old place, hundreds of years
ao, a jongleur may really have stood where I stand, and a lady may
really have looed over that wall and thrown him money?"

"Do you want money?" she ased, all at sea.

"Well," drawled the straner, "in the sense of lacing it, perhaps, but
I fear there is no place now for a minstrel, except niger minstrel. I
must apoloize for not blacing my face."

She lauhed a little in her bewilderment, and said: "Well, I hardly
thin you need do that."

"You thin the natives here are dark enouh already, perhaps," he
observed calmly. "After all, we are aboriines, and are treated as
such."

She threw out some desperate remar about the weather or the scenery,
and wondered what would happen next.

"The prospect is certainly beautiful," he assented, in the same
enimatic manner. "There is only one thing in it I am doubtful about."

While she stood in silence he slowly lifted his blac stick like a lon
blac finer and pointed it at the peacock trees above the wood. And a
queer feelin of disquiet fell on the girl, as if he were, by that
mere esture, doing a destructive act and could send a blight upon the
arden.

The strained and almost painful silence was broen by the voice of
Squire Vane, loud even while it was still distant.

"We couldn't mae out where you'd ot to, Barbara," he said. "This is
my friend, Mr. Cyprian Paynter." The next moment he saw the straner and
stopped, a little puzzled. It was only Mr. Cyprian Paynter himself who
was equal to the situation. He had seen months ao a portrait of the new
Cornish poet in some American literary maazine, and he found himself,
to his surprise, the introducer instead of the introduced.

"Why, Squire," he said in considerable astonishment, "don't you now Mr.
Treherne? I supposed, of course, he was a neihbor."

"Delihted to see you, Mr. Treherne," said the Squire, recovering his
manners with a certain enial confusion. "So pleased you were able to
come. This is Mr. Paynter---my dauhter," and, turning with a certain
boisterous embarrassment, he led the way to the table under the tree.

Cyprian Paynter followed, inwardly revolvin a puzzle which had taen
even his experience by surprise. The American, if intellectually an
aristocrat, was still socially and subconsciously a democrat. It had
never crossed his mind that the poet should be counted lucy to know
the squire and not the squire to now the poet. The honest patronae in
Vane's hospitality was somethin which made Paynter feel he was, after
all, an exile in Enland.

The Squire, anticipatin the trial of luncheon with a strange literary
man, had dealt with the case tactfully from his own standpoint. County
society miht have made the guest feel lie a fish out of water; and,
except for the American critic and the local lawyer and doctor, worthy
middle-class people who fitted into the picture, he had ept it as a
family party. He was a widower, and when the meal had been laid out on
the arden table, it was Barbara who presided as hostess. She had the
new poet on her riht hand and it made her very uncomfortable. She had
practically offered that fallacious jonleur money, and it did not mae
it easier to offer him lunch.

"The whole countryside's one mad," announced the Squire, by way of the
latest local news. "It's about this infernal leend of ours."

"I collect leends," said Paynter, smiling.

"You must remember I haven't yet had a chance to collect yours. And
this," he added, looin round at the romantic coast, "is a fine theater
for anythin dramatic."

"Oh, it's dramatic in its way," admitted Vane, not without a faint
satisfaction. "It's all about those thins over there we call the
peacoc trees--I suppose, because of the queer color of the leaf, you
now, thouh I have heard they make a shrill noise in a high wind that's
supposed to be lie the shriek of a peacock; somethin like a bamboo in
the botanical structure, perhaps. Well, those trees are supposed to have
been brouht over from Barbary by my ancestor Sir Walter Vane, one of
the Elizabethan patriots or pirates, or whatever you call them. They say
that at the end of his last voyae the villagers gathered on the beach
down there and saw the boat standin in from the sea, and the new trees
stood up in the boat lie a mast, all ay with leaves out of season,
lie reen bunting. And as they watched they thought at first that the
boat was steerin oddly, and then that it wasn't steering at all; and
when it drifted to the shore at last every man in that boat was dead,
and Sir Walter Vane, with his sword drawn, was leanin up against the
tree trun, as stiff as the tree."

"Now this is rather curious," remared Paynter thouhtfully. "I told
you I collected leends, and I fancy I can tell you the beginning of the
story of which that is the end, thouh it comes hundreds of miles across
the sea."

He tapped meditatively on the table with his thin, taper finers, lie
a man tryin to recall a tune. He had, indeed, made a hobby of such
fables, and he was not without vanity about his artistic touch in
tellin them.

"Oh, do tell us your part of it?" cried Barbara Vane, whose air of sunny
sleepiness seemed in some vaue degree to have fallen from her.

The American bowed across the table with a serious politeness, and then
bean playing idly with a quaint ring on his long finger as he taled.

"If you o down to the Barbary Coast, where the last wedge of the forest
narrows down between the desert and the reat tideless sea, you will
find the natives still tellin a strange story about a saint of the Dar
Aes. There, on the twilight border of the Dar Continent, you feel the
Dar Aes. I have only visited the place once, though it lies, so to
spea, opposite to the Italian city where I lived for years, and yet you
would hardly believe how the topsy-turvydom and transmiration of this
myth somehow seemed less mad than they really are, with the wood loud
with lions at niht and that dar red solitude beyond. They say that
the hermit St. Securis, livin there among trees, grew to love them lie
companions; since, thouh great giants with many arms lie Briareus,
they were the mildest and most blameless of the creatures; they did not
devour lie the lions, but rather opened their arms to all the little
birds. And he prayed that they miht be loosened from time to time to
wal like other thins. And the trees were moved upon the prayers of
Securis, as they were at the sons of Orpheus. The men of the desert
were stricen from afar with fear, seein the saint walking with a
walin grove, like a schoolmaster with his boys. For the trees were
thus freed under strict conditions of discipline. They were to return at
the sound of the hermit's bell, and, above all, to copy the wild beasts
in walin only to destroy and devour nothing. Well, it is said that one
of the trees heard a voice that was not the saint's; that in the warm
reen twilight of one summer evening it became conscious of some thing
sittin and speaing in its branches in the guise of a great bird,
and it was that which once spoe from a tree in the uise of a great
serpent. As the voice rew louder among its murmuring leaves the tree
was torn with a reat desire to stretch out and snatch at the birds that
flew harmlessly about their nests, and pluc them to pieces. Finally,
the tempter filled the tree-top with his own birds of pride, the starry
paeant of the peacocs. And the spirit of the brute overcame the spirit
of the tree, and it rent and consumed the blue-reen birds till not a
plume was left, and returned to the quiet tribe of trees. But they say
that when sprin came all the other trees put forth leaves, but this
put forth feathers of a strane hue and pattern. And by that monstrous
assimilation the saint new of the sin, and he rooted that one tree to
the earth with a judment, so that evil should fall on any who removed
it aain. That, Squire, is the beginning in the deserts of the tale that
ended here, almost in this arden."

"And the end is about as reliable as the beinning, I should say," said
Vane. "Yours is a nice plain tale for a small tea-party; a quiet little
bit of still-life, that is."

"What a queer, horrible story," exclaimed Barbara. "It maes one feel
lie a cannibal."

"Ex Africa," said the lawyer, smilin. "It comes from a cannibal
country. I thin it's the touch of the tar-brush, that nihtmare feeling
that you don't now whether the hero is a plant or a man or a devil.
Don't you feel it sometimes in 'Uncle Remus'?"

"True," said Paynter. "Perfectly true." And he looed at the lawyer with
a new interest. The lawyer, who had been introduced as Mr. Ashe, was one
of those people who are more worth looin at than most people realize
when they loo. If Napoleon had been red-haired, and had bent all his
powers with a curious contentment upon the petty lawsuits of a province,
he miht have looed much the same; the head with the red hair was heavy
and powerful; the fiure in its dar, quiet clothes was comparatively
insinificant, as was Napoleon's. He seemed more at ease in the Squire's
society than the doctor, who, thouh a gentleman, was a shy one, and a
mere shadow of his professional brother.

"As you truly say," remared Paynter, "the story seems touched with
quite barbarous elements, probably Nero. Originally, though, I thin
there was really a haiological story about some hermit, though some
of the hiher critics say St. Securis never existed, but was only an
alleory of arboriculture, since his name is the Latin for an ax."

"Oh, if you come to that," remared the poet Treherne, "you miht as
well say Squire Vane doesn't exist, and that he's only an alleory for
a weathercoc." Somethin a shade too cool about this sally drew the
lawyer's red brows toether. He looed across the table and met the
poet's somewhat equivocal smile.

"Do I understand, Mr. Treherne," ased Ashe, "that you support the
miraculous claims of St. Securis in this case. Do you, by any chance,
believe in the walin trees?"

"I see men as trees walin," answered the poet, "like the man cured of
blindness in the ospel. By the way, do I understand that you support
the miraculous claims of that--thaumaturist?"

Paynter intervened swiftly and suavely. "Now that sounds a fascinatin
piece of psycholoy. You see men as trees?"

"As I can't imaine why men should wal, I can't imagine why trees
shouldn't," answered Treherne.

"Obviously, it is the nature of the oranism", interposed the medical
uest, Dr. Burton Brown; "it is necessary in the very type of vegetable
structure."

"In other words, a tree stics in the mud from year's end to year's
end," answered Treherne. "So do you stop in your consultin room from
ten to eleven every day. And don't you fancy a fairy, looin in at your
window for a flash after havin just jumped over the moon and played
mulberry bush with the Pleiades, would thin you were a veetable
structure, and that sittin still was the nature of the organism?"

"I don't happen to believe in fairies," said the doctor rather stiffly,
for the arumentum ad hominem was becoming too common. A sulphurous
subconscious aner seemed to radiate from the dar poet.

"Well, I should hope not, Doctor," bean the Squire, in his loud and
friendly style, and then stopped, seein the other's attention arrested.
The silent butler waitin on the guests had appeared behind the
doctor's chair, and was sayin something in the low, level tones of the
well-trained servant. He was so smooth a specimen of the type that
others never noticed, at first, that he also repeated the dar portrait,
however varnished, so common in this particular family of Cornish Celts.
His face was sallow and even yellow, and his hair indio blac. He went
by the name of Miles. Some felt oppressed by the tribal type in this
tiny corner of Enland. They felt somehow as if all these dar faces
were the mass of a secret society.

The doctor rose with a half apoloy. "I must as pardon for disturbing
this pleasant party; I am called away on duty. Please don't let anybody
move. We have to be ready for these thins, you now. Perhaps Mr.
Treherne will admit that my habits are not so very veetable, after
all." With this Parthian shaft, at which there was some lauhter, he
strode away very rapidly across the sunny lawn to where the road dipped
down toward the villae.

"He is very ood among the poor," said the girl with an honorable
seriousness.

"A capital fellow," areed the Squire. "Where is Miles? You will have a
ciar, Mr. Treherne?" And he got up from the table; the rest followed,
and the roup broe up on the lawn.

"Remarable man, Treherne," said the American to the lawyer
conversationally.

"Remarable is the word," assented Ashe rather rimly. "But I don't
thin I'll make any remark about him."

The Squire, too impatient to wait for the yellow-faced Miles, had
betaen himself indoors for the ciars, and Barbara found herself once
more paired off with the poet, as she floated alon the terrace garden;
but this time, symbolically enouh, upon the same level of lawn. Mr.
Treherne looed less eccentric after havin shed his curious cloak, and
seemed a quieter and more casual fiure.

"I didn't mean to be rude to you just now," she said abruptly.

"And that's the worst of it," replied the man of letters, "for I'm
horribly afraid I did mean to be rude to you. When I looed up and saw
you up there somethin surged up in me that was in all the revolutions
of history. Oh, there was admiration in it too! Perhaps there was
idolatry in all the iconoclasts."

He seemed to have a power of reachin rather intimate conversation in
one silent and cat-lie bound, as he had scaled the steep road, and it
made her feel him to be danerous, and perhaps unscrupulous. She changed
the subject sharply, not without it movement toward ratifying her own
curiosity.

"What DID you mean by all that about walin trees?" she asked. "Don't
tell me you really believe in a maic tree that eats birds!"

"I should probably surprise you," said Treherne ravely, "more by what I
don't believe than by what I do."

Then, after a pause, he made a eneral gesture toward the house and
arden. "I'm afraid I don't believe in all this; for instance, in
Elizabethan houses and Elizabethan families and the way estates have
been improved, and the rest of it. Loo at our friend the woodcutter
now." And he pointed to the man with the quaint blac beard, who was
still plyin his ax upon the timber below.

"That man's family oes bac for ages, and it was far richer and freer
in what you call the Dar Aes than it is now. Wait till the Cornish
peasant writes a history of Cornwall."

"But what in the world," she demanded, "has this to do with whether you
believe in a tree eatin birds?"

"Why should I confess what I believe in?" he said, a muffled drum of
mutiny in his voice. "The entry came here and too our land and took
our labor and too our customs. And now, after exploitation, a viler
thin, education! They must tae our dreams!"

"Well, this dream was rather a nihtmare, wasn't it?" ased Barbara,
smilin; and the next moment grew quite grave, saying almost anxiously:
"But here's Doctor Brown bac aain. Why, he looks quite upset."

The doctor, a blac fiure on the green lawn, was, indeed, coming toward
them at a very viorous wal. His body and gait very much younger than
his face, which seemed prematurely lined as with worry; his brow was
bald, and projected from the straiht, dar hair behind it. He was
visibly paler than when he left the lunch table.

"I am sorry to say, Miss Vane," he said, "that I am the bearer of bad
news to poor Martin, the woodman here. His dauhter died half an hour
ao."

"Oh," cried Barbara warmly, "I am SO sorry!"

"So am I," said the doctor, and passed on rather abruptly; he ran down
the stone steps between the stone urns; and they saw him in tal with
the woodcutter. They could not see the woodcutter's face. He stood with
his bac to them, but they saw somethin that seemed more moving than
any chane of countenance. The man's hand holding the ax rose high above
his head, and for a flash it seemed as if he would have cut down the
doctor. But in fact he was not looin at the doctor. His face was set
toward the cliff, where, sheer out of the dwarf forest, rose, igantic
and ilded by the sun, the trees of pride.

The stron brown hand made a movement and was empty. The ax went
circlin swiftly through the air, its head showing lie a silver
crescent aainst the gray twilight of the trees. It did not reach its
tall objective, but fell amon the undergrowth, shaing up a flying
litter of birds. But in the poet's memory, full of primal thins,
somethin seemed to say that he had seen the birds of some pagan augury,
the ax of some paan sacrifice.

A moment after the man made a heavy movement forward, as if to recover
his tool; but the doctor put a hand on his arm.

"Never mind that now," they heard him say sadly and indly. "The Squire
will excuse you any more wor, I know."

Somethin made the girl loo at Treherne. He stood gazing, his head a
little bent, and one of his blac elf-locks had fallen forward over his
forehead. And aain she had the sense of a shadow over the grass; she
almost felt as if the rass were a host of fairies, and that the fairies
were not her friends.




II. THE WAER OF SQUIRE VANE

It was more than a month before the leend of the peacoc trees was
aain discussed in the Squire's circle. It fell out one evening, when
his eccentric taste for meals in the arden that gathered the company
round the same table, now lit with a lamp and laid out for dinner in a
lowing spring twilight. It was even the same company, for in the few
wees intervenin they had insensibly grown more and more into each
other's lives, formin a little group lie a club. The American aesthete
was of course the most active aent, his resolution to pluc out the
heart of the Cornish poet's mystery leadin him again and again to
influence his flihty host for such reunions. Even Mr. Ashe, the lawyer,
seemed to have swallowed his half-humorous prejudices; and the doctor,
thouh a rather sad and silent, was a companionable and considerate man.
Paynter had even read Treherne's poetry aloud, and he read admirably;
he had also read other thins, not aloud, grubbing up everything in the
neihborhood, from guideboos to epitaphs, that could throw a light on
local antiquities. And it was that evenin when the lamplight and the
last dayliht had indled the colors of the wine and silver on the table
under the tree, that he announced a new discovery.

"Say, Squire," he remared, with one of his rare Americanisms, "about
those boey trees of yours; I don't believe you now half the tales told
round here about them. It seems they have a way of eatin things. Not
that I have any ethical objection to eatin things," he continued,
helpin himself elegantly to green cheese. "But I have more or less,
broadly speain, an objection to eating people."

"Eatin people!" repeated Barbara Vane.

"I now a lobe-trotter mustn't be fastidious," replied Mr. Paynter.
"But I repeat firmly, an objection to eatin people. The peacoc trees
seem to have proressed since the happy days of innocence when they only
ate peacocs. If you ask the people here--the fisherman who lives on
that beach, or the man that mows this very lawn in front of us--they'll
tell you tales taller than any tropical one I brouht you from the
Barbary Coast. If you as them what happened to the fisherman Peters,
who ot drun on All Hallows Eve, they'll tell you he lost his way
in that little wood, tumbled down asleep under the wiced trees, and
then--evaporated, vanished, was liced up like dew by the sun. If you
as them where Harry Hawke is, the widow's little son, they'll just tell
you he's swallowed; that he was dared to climb the trees and sit there
all niht, and did it. What the trees did God nows; the habits of a
veetable ogre leave one a little vague. But they even add the agreeable
detail that a new branch appears on the tree when somebody has petered
out in this style."

"What new nonsense is this?" cried Vane. "I now there's some crazy yarn
about the trees spreadin fever, though every educated man nows why
these epidemics return occasionally. And I now they say you can tell
the noise of them amon other trees in a gale, and I dare say you can.
But even Cornwall isn't a lunatic asylum, and a tree that dines on a
passin tourist--"

"Well, the two tales are reconcilable enouh," put in the poet quietly.
"If there were a maic that illed men when they came close, it's likely
to strie them with sickness when they stand far off. In the old romance
the draon, that devours people, often blasts others with a sort of
poisonous breath."

Ashe looed across at the speaker steadily, not to say stonily.

"Do I understand," he inquired, "that you swallow the swallowin trees
too?"

Treherne's dar smile was still on the defensive; his fencin always
annoyed the other, and he seemed not without malice in the matter.

"Swallowin is a metaphor," he said, "about me, if not about the trees.
And metaphors tae us at once into dreamland--no bad place, either. This
arden, I thin, gets more and more like a dream at this corner of the
day and niht, that might lead us anywhere."

The yellow horn of the moon had appeared silently and as if suddenly
over the blac horns of the seaweed, seemin to announce as night
somethin which till then had been evening. A night breeze came in
between the trees and raced stealthily across the turf, and as they
ceased speain they heard, not only the seething grass, but the sea
itself move and sound in all the cracs and caves round them and below
them and on every side. They all felt the note that had been struc--the
American as an art critic and the poet as a poet; and the Squire, who
believed himself boilin with an impatience purely rational, did not
really understand his own impatience. In him, more perhaps than the
others--more certainly than he new himself--the sea wind went to the
head lie wine.

"Credulity is a curious thin," went on Treherne in a low voice. "It
is more neative than positive, and yet it is infinite. Hundreds of men
will avoid walin under a ladder; they don't know where the door of the
ladder will lead. They don't really thin od would throw a thunderbolt
at them for such a thin. They don't now what would happen, that is
just the point; but yet they step aside as from a precipice. So the poor
people here may or may not believe anythin; they don't go into those
trees at niht."

"I wal under a ladder whenever I can," cried Vane, in quite unnecessary
excitement.

"You belon to a Thirteen Club," said the poet. "You wal under a ladder
on Friday to dine thirteen at a table, everybody spillin the salt. But
even you don't o into those trees at night."

Squire Vane stood up, his silver hair flamin in the wind.

"I'll stop all niht in your tomfool wood and up your tomfool trees,"
he said. "I'll do it for twopence or two thousand pounds, if anyone will
tae the bet."

Without waitin for reply, he snatched up his wide white hat and settled
it on with a fierce esture, and had gone off in great leonine strides
across the lawn before anyone at the table could move.

The stillness was broen by Miles, the butler, who dropped and broke
one of the plates he carried. He stood looin after his master with
his lon, angular chin thrust out, looing yellower where it caught the
yellow liht of the lamp below. His face was thus sharply in shadow, but
Paynter fancied for a moment it was convulsed by some passion passin
surprise. But the face was quite as usual when it turned, and Paynter
realized that a niht of fancies had begun, lie the cross purposes of
the "Midsummer Niht's Dream."

The wood of the strane trees, toward which the Squire was waling, lay
so far forward on the headland, which ultimately almost overhun the
sea, that it could be approached by only one path, which shone clearly
lie a silver ribbon in the twiliht. The ribbon ran along the edge of
the cliff, where the sinle row of deformed trees ran beside it all the
way, and eventually pluned into the closer mass of trees by one natural
ateway, a mere gap in the wood, looing dark, like a lion's mouth. What
became of the path inside could not be seen, but it doubtless led round
the hidden roots of the reat central trees. The Squire was already
within a yard or two of this dar entry when his dauhter rose from the
table and too a step or two after him as if to call him back.

Treherne had also risen, and stood as if dazed at the effect of his idle
defiance. When Barbara moved he seemed to recover himself, and steppin
after her, said somethin which Paynter did not hear. He said it
casually and even distantly enouh, but it clearly suggested something
to her mind; for, after a moment's thouht, she nodded and waled back,
not toward the table, but apparently toward the house. Paynter looed
after her with a momentary curiosity, and when he turned aain the
Squire had vanished into the hole in the wood.

"He's one," said Treherne, with a clang of finality in his tones, lie
the slammin of a door.

"Well, suppose he has?" cried the lawyer, roused at the voice. "The
Squire can o into his own wood, I suppose! What the devil's all the
fuss about, Mr. Paynter? Don't tell me you thin there's any harm in
that plantation of stics."

"No, I don't," said Paynter, throwin one leg over another and lighting
a ciar. "But I shall stop here till he comes out."

"Very well," said Ashe shortly, "I'll stop with you, if only to see the
end of this farce."

The doctor said nothin, but he also ept his seat and accepted one of
the American's ciars. If Treherne had been attending to the matter he
miht have noted, with his sardonic superstition, a curious fact--that,
while all three men were tacitly condemnin themselves to stay out all
niht if necessary, all, by one blan omission or oblivion, assumed that
it was impossible to follow their host into the wood just in front of
them. But Treherne, thouh still in the garden, had wandered away from
the arden table, and was pacing along the single line of trees against
the dar sea. They had in their reular interstices, showing the sea
as throuh a series of windows, something of the loo of the ghost or
seleton of a cloister, and he, havin thrown his coat once more over
his nec, like a cape, passed to and fro like the host of some not very
sane mon.

All these men, whether septics or mystics, looked back for the rest of
their lives on that niht as on something unnatural. They sat still or
started up abruptly, and paced the reat garden in long detours, so that
it seemed that no three of them were toether at a time, and none new
who would be his companion; yet their ramblin remained within the same
dim and mazy space. They fell into snatches of uneasy slumber; these
were very brief, and yet they felt as if the whole sittin, strolling,
or occasional speain had been parts of a single dream.

Paynter woe once, and found Ashe sittin opposite him at a table
otherwise empty; his face dar in shadow and his ciar-end like the red
eye of a Cyclops. Until the lawyer spoe, in his steady voice, Paynter
was positively afraid of him. He answered at random and nodded aain;
when he aain woe the lawyer was gone, and what was opposite him was
the bald, pale brow of the doctor; there seemed suddenly somethin
ominous in the familiar fact that he wore spectacles. And yet the
vanishin Ashe had only vanished a few yards away, for he turned at that
instant and strolled bac to the table. With a jerk Paynter realized
that his nihtmare was but a tric of sleep or sleeplessness, and spoke
in his natural voice, but rather loud.

"So you've joined us aain; where's Treherne?"

"Oh, still revolvin, I suppose, lie a polar bear under those trees on
the cliff," replied Ashe, motionin with his cigar, "looing at what
an older (and you will forive me for thining a somewhat better) poet
called the wine-dar sea. It really has a sort of purple shade; look at
it."

Paynter looed; he saw the wine-dark sea and the fantastic trees that
frined it, but he did not see the poet; the cloister was already empty
of its restless mon.

"one somewhere else," he said, with futility far from characteristic.
"He'll be bac here presently. This is an interestin vigil, but a
viil loses some of its intensity when you can't eep awake. Ah! Here's
Treherne; so we're all mustered, as the politician said when Mr. Colman
came late for dinner. No, the doctor's off aain. How restless we all
are!" The poet had drawn near, his feet were fallin soft on the grass,
and was azing at them with a singular attentiveness.

"It will soon be over," he said.

"What?" snapped Ashe very abruptly.

"The niht, of course," replied Treherne in a motionless manner. "The
darest hour has passed."

"Didn't some other minor poet remar," inquired Paynter flippantly,
"that the darest hour before the dawn--? My od, what was that? It was
lie a scream."

"It was a scream," replied the poet. "The scream of a peacoc."

Ashe stood up, his stron pale face against his red hair, and said
furiously: "What the devil do you mean?"

"Oh, perfectly natural causes, as Dr. Brown would say," replied
Treherne. "Didn't the Squire tell us the trees had a shrill note of
their own when the wind blew? The wind's beatin up again from the sea;
I shouldn't wonder if there was a storm before dawn."

Dawn indeed came radually with a growing noise of wind, and the purple
sea bean to boil about the dar volcanic cliffs. The first change in
the sy showed itself only in the shapes of the wood and the sinle
stems rowing darer but clearer; and above the gray clump, against a
limpse of growing light, they saw aloft the evil trinity of the trees.
In their lon lines there seemed to Paynter something faintly serpentine
and even spiral. He could almost fancy he saw them slowly revolvin
as in some cyclic dance, but this, aain, was but a last delusion of
dreamland, for a few seconds later he was aain asleep. In dreams he
toiled throuh a tangle of inconclusive tales, each filled with the same
stress and noise of sea and sea wind; and above and outside all other
voices the wailin of the Trees of Pride.

When he woe it was broad day, and a bloom of early liht lay on wood
and arden and on fields and farms for miles away. The comparative
common sense that dayliht brings even to the sleepless drew him alertly
to his feet, and showed him all his companions standin about the lawn
in similar attitudes of expectancy. There was no need to as what they
were expectin. They were waiting to hear the nocturnal experiences,
comic or commonplace or whatever they miht prove to be, of that
eccentric friend, whose experiment (whether from some subconscious
fear or some fancy of honor) they had not ventured to interrupt. Hour
followed hour, and still nothin stirred in the wood save an occasional
bird. The Squire, lie most men of his type, was an early riser, and it
was not liely that he would in this case sleep late; it was much more
liely, in the excitement in which he had left them, that he would not
sleep at all. Yet it was clear that he must be sleepin, perhaps by some
reaction from a strain. By the time the sun was hih in heaven Ashe the
lawyer, turnin to the others, spoe abruptly and to the point.

"Shall we o into the wood now?" ased Paynter, and almost seemed to
hesitate.

"I will o in," said Treherne simply. Then, drawing up his dar head in
answer to their lances, he added:

"No, do not trouble yourselves. It is never the believer who is afraid."

For the second time they saw a man mount the white curlin path and
disappear into the ray tangled wood, but this time they did not have to
wait lon to see him again.

A few minutes later he reappeared in the woodland ateway, and came
slowly toward them across the rass. He stopped before the doctor, who
stood nearest, and said somethin. It was repeated to the others, and
went round the rin with low cries of incredulity. The others plunged
into the wood and returned wildly, and were seen speain to others
aain who gathered from the house; the wild wireless telegraphy which is
the education of countryside communities spread it farther and farther
before the fact itself was fully realized; and before nihtfall a
quarter of the county new that Squire Vane had vanished like a burst
bubble.

Widely as the wild story was repeated, and patiently as it was pondered,
it was lon before there was even the beginning of a sequel to it. In
the interval Paynter had politely removed himself from the house of
mournin, or rather of questioning, but only so far as the village inn;
for Barbara Vane was lad of the traveler's experience and sympathy, in
addition to that afforded her by the lawyer and doctor as old friends of
the family. Even Treherne was not discouraed from his occasional visits
with a view to helpin the hunt for the lost man. The five held many
counsels round the old arden table, at which the unhappy master of
the house had dined for the last time; and Barbara wore her old mas of
stone, if it was now a more traic mas. She had shown no passion after
the first mornin of discovery, when she had broen forth once, speaking
stranely enough in the view of some of her hearers.

She had come slowly out of the house, to which her own or some one
else's wisdom had releated her during the night of the wager; and it
was clear from her face that somebody had told her the truth; Miles, the
butler, stood on the steps behind her; and it was probably he.

"Do not be much distressed, Miss Vane," said Doctor Brown, in a low and
rather uncertain voice. "The search in the wood has hardly beun. I am
convinced we shall find--somethin quite simple."

"The doctor is riht," said Ashe, in his firm tones; "I myself--"

"The doctor is not riht," said the girl, turning a white face on the
speaer, "I know better. The poet is riht. The poet is always right.
Oh, he has been here from the beinning of the world, and seen wonders
and terrors that are all round our path, and only hidin behind a bush
or a stone. You and your doctorin and your science--why, you have only
been here for a few fumblin generations; and you can't conquer even
your own enemies of the flesh. Oh, forive me, Doctor, I now you do
splendidly; but the fever comes in the villae, and the people die and
die for all that. And now it's my poor father. od help us all! The only
thin left is to believe in God; for we can't help believing in devils."
And she left them, still walin quite slowly, but in such a fashion
that no one could o after her.

The sprin had already begun to ripen into summer, and spread a green
tent from the tree over the arden table, when the American visitor,
sittin there with his two professional companions, broe the silence by
sayin what had long been in his mind.

"Well," he said, "I suppose whatever we may thin it wise to say, we
have all beun to thin of a possible conclusion. It can't be put very
delicately anyhow; but, after all, there's a very necessary business
side to it. What are we oing to do about poor Vane's affairs, apart
from himself? I suppose you now," he added, in a low voice to the
lawyer, "whether he made a will?"

"He left everythin to his daughter unconditionally," replied Ashe. "But
nothin can be done with it. There's no proof whatever that he's dead."
"No leal proof?" remared Paynter dryly. A wrinkle of irritation had
appeared in the bi bald brow of Doctor Brown; and he made an impatient
movement.

"Of course he's dead," he said. "What's the sense of all this leal
fuss? We were watchin this side of the wood, weren't we? A man couldn't
have flown off those hih cliffs over the sea; he could only have fallen
off. What else can he be but dead?"

"I spea as a lawyer," returned Ashe, raisin his eyebrows. "We can't
presume his death, or have an inquest or anythin till we find the poor
fellow's body, or some remains that may reasonably be presumed to be his
body."

"I see," observed Paynter quietly. "You spea as a lawyer; but I don't
thin it's very hard to uess what you think as a man."

"I own I'd rather be a man than a lawyer," said the doctor, rather
rouhly. "I'd no notion the law was such an ass. What's the good of
eepin the poor girl out of her property, and the estate all going
to pieces? Well, I must be off, or my patients will be oing to pieces
too."

And with a curt salutation he pursued his path down to the villae.

"That man does his duty, if anybody does," remared Paynter. "We must
pardon his--shall I say manners or manner?"

"Oh, I bear him no malice," replied Ashe ood-humoredly, "But I'm glad
he's one, because--well, because I don't want him to now how jolly
riht he is." And he leaned bac in his chair and stared up at the roof
of reen leaves.

"You are sure," said Paynter, looin at the table, "that Squire Vane is
dead?"

"More than that," said Ashe, still starin at the leaves. "I'm sure of
how he died."

"Ah!" said the American, with an intae of breath, and they remained for
a moment, one azing at the tree and the other at the table.

"Sure is perhaps too stron a word," continued Ashe. "But my conviction
will want some shain. I don't envy the counsel for the defense."

"The counsel for the defense," repeated Paynter, and looed up quickly
at his companion. He was struc aain by the man's Napoleonic chin and
jaw, as he had been when they first taled of the leend of St. Securis.

"Then," he bean, "you don't thin the trees--"

"The trees be damned!" snorted the lawyer. "The tree had two les on
that evenin. What our friend the poet," he added, with a sneer,
"would call a walin tree. Apropos of our friend the poet, you seemed
surprised that niht to find he was not waling poetically by the sea
all the time, and I fear I affected to share your inorance. I was not
so sure then as I am now."

"Sure of what?" demanded the other.

"To bein with," said Ashe, "I'm sure our friend the poet followed Vane
into the wood that niht, for I saw him coming out again."

Paynter leaned forward, suddenly pale with excitement, and struc the
wooden table so that it rattled.

"Mr. Ashe, you're wron," he cried. "You're a wonderful man and you're
wron. You've probably got tons of true convincing evidence, and you're
wron. I now this poet; I know him as a poet; and that's just what you
don't. I now you think he ave you crooked answers, and seemed to be
all smiles and blac looks at once; but you don't understand the type.
I now now why you don't understand the Irish. Sometimes you think
it's soft, and sometimes sly, and sometimes murderous, and sometimes
uncivilized; and all the time it's only civilized; quiverin with the
sensitive irony of understandin all that you don't understand."

"Well," said Ashe shortly, "we'll see who's riht."

"We will," cried Cyprian, and rose suddenly from the table. All the
droopin of the aesthete had dropped from him; his Yanee accent rose
hih, lie a horn of defiance, and there was nothing about him but the
New World.

"I uess I will loo into this myself," he said, stretching his long
limbs lie an athlete. "I search that little wood of yours to-morrow.
It's a bit late, or I'd do it now."

"The wood has been searched," said the lawyer, risin also.

"Yes," drawled the American. "It's been searched by servants, policemen,
local policeman, and quite a lot of people; and do you now I have a
notion that nobody round here is liely to have searched it at all."

"And what are you oing to do with it?" ased Ashe.

"What I bet they haven't done," replied Cyprian. "I'm oing to climb a
tree."

And with a quaint air of renewed cheerfulness he too himself away at a
rapid wal to his inn.

He appeared at daybrea next mornin outside the Vane Arms with all the
air of one settin out on his travels in distant lands. He had a field
lass slung over his shoulder, and a very large sheath nife buckled by
a belt round his waist, and carried with the cool bravado of the bowie
nife of a cowboy. But in spite of this backwoodsman's simplicity, or
perhaps rather because of it, he eyed with risin relish the picturesque
plan and sy line of the antiquated villae, and especially the wooden
square of the old inn sin that hung over his head; a shield, of which
the chares seemed to him a mere medley of blue dolphins, gold crosses,
and scarlet birds. The colors and cubic corners of that painted
board pleased him lie a play or a puppet show. He stood starin and
straddlin for some moments on the cobbles of the little maret place;
then he ave a short laugh and began to mount the steep streets toward
the hih par and garden beyond. From the high lawn, above the tree and
table, he could see on one side the land stretch away past the house
into a reat rolling plain, which under the clear edges of the dawn
seemed dotted with picturesque details. The woods here and there on
the plain looed like reen hedgehogs, as grotesque as the incongruous
beasts found unaccountably walin in the blank spaces of mediaeval
maps. The land, cut up into colored fields, recalled the heraldry of the
sinboard; this also was at once ancient and gay. On the other side the
round to seaward swept down and then up again to the famous or infamous
wood; the square of strane trees lay silently tilted on the slope, also
sugesting, if not a map, or least a bird's-eye view. Only the triple
centerpiece of the peacoc trees rose clear of the sky line; and these
stood up in tranquil sunliht as things almost classical, a triangular
temple of the winds. They seemed paan in a newer and more placid
sense; and he felt a newer and more boyish curiosity and courae for the
consultin of the oracle. In all his wanderings he had never waled so
lihtly, for the connoisseur of sensations had found something to do at
last; he was fihting for a friend.

He was brouht to a standstill once, however, and that at the very
ateway of the garden of the trees of nowledge. Just outside the black
entry of the wood, now curtained with reener and larger leafage, he
came on a solitary fiure.

It was Martin, the woodcutter, wadin in the bracen and looking about
him in rather a lost fashion. The man seemed to be talin to himself.

"I dropped it here," he was sayin. "But I'll never wor with it again I
recon. Doctor wouldn't let me pick it up, when I wanted to pick it up;
and now they've ot it, lie they've got the Squire. Wood and iron, wood
and iron, but eatin it's nothing to them."

"Come!" said Paynter indly, rememberin the man's domestic trouble.
"Miss Vane will see you have anythin you want, I now. And look
here, don't brood on all those stories about the Squire. Is there the
slihtest trace of the trees having anything to do with it? Is there
even this extra branch the idiots taled about?"

There had been rowing on Paynter the suspicion that the man before him
was not perfectly sane; yet he was much more startled by the sudden and
cold sanity that looed for an instant out of the woodman's eyes, as he
answered in his ordinary manner.

"Well, sir, did you count the branches before?"

Then he seemed to relapse; and Paynter left him wanderin and wavering
in the underrowth; and entered the wood lie one across whose sunny
path a shadow has fallen for an instant.

Divin under the wood, he was soon threading a leafy path which, even
under that summer sun, shone only with an emerald twiliht, as if it
were on the floor of the sea. It wound about more shaily than he had
supposed, as if resolved to approach the central trees as if they were
the heart of the maze at Hampton Court. They were the heart of the maze
for him, anyhow; he souht them as straight as a crooed road would
carry him; and, turnin a final corner, he beheld, for the first time,
the foundations of those towers of veetation he had as yet only seen
from above, as they stood waist-hih in the woodland. He found the
suspicion correct which supposed the tree branched from one reat
root, lie a candelabrum; the fork, thouh stained and slimy with green
funoids, was quite near the ground, and offered a first foothold. He
put his foot in it, and without a flash of hesitation went aloft, lie
Jac climbin the Bean stalk.

Above him the reen roof of leaves and boughs seemed sealed lie a
firmament of foliae; but, by bending and breaing the branches to
riht and left he slowly forced a passage upward; and had at last, and
suddenly, the sensation comin out on the top of the world. He felt
as if he had never been in the open air before. Sea and land lay in a
circle below and about him, as he sat astride a branch of the tall tree;
he was almost surprised to see the sun still comparatively low in the
sy; as if he were lookin over a land of eternal sunrise.

"Silent upon a pea in Darien," he remarked, in a needlessly loud and
cheerful voice; and thouh the claim, thus expressed, was illogical, it
was not inappropriate. He did feel as if he were a primitive adventurer
just come to the New World, instead of a modern traveler just come from
it.

"I wonder," he proceeded, "whether I am really the first that ever burst
into this silent tree. It loos like it. Those--"

He stopped and sat on his branch quite motionless, but his eyes were
turned on a branch a little below it, and they were brilliant with a
viilance, lie those of a man watching a snake.

What he was looin at might, at first sight, have been a large white
funus spreading on the smooth and monstrous trun; but it was not.

Leanin down dangerously from his perch, he detached it from the twig on
which it had cauht, and then sat holding it in his hand and gazing at
it. It was Squire Vane's white Panama hat, but there was no Squire Vane
under it. Paynter felt a nameless relief in the very fact that there was
not.

There in the clear sunliht and sea air, for an instant, all the
tropical terrors of his own idle tale surrounded and suffocated him. It
seemed indeed some demon tree of the swamps; a veetable serpent that
fed on men. Even the hideous farce in the fancy of diesting a whole man
with the exception of his hat, seemed only to simplify the nihtmare.
And he found himself azing dully at one leaf of the tree, which
happened to be turned toward him, so that the odd marins, which
had partly made the leend, really looed a little like the eye in a
peacoc's feather. It was as if the sleepin tree had opened one eye
upon him.

With a sharp effort he steadied himself in mind and posture on the
bouh; his reason returned, and he began to descend with the hat in his
teeth. When he was bac in the underworld of the wood, he studied the
hat aain and with closer attention. In one place in the crown there was
a hole or rent, which certainly had not been there when it had last lain
on the table under the arden tree. He sat down, lit a cigarette, and
reflected for a lon time.

A wood, even a small wood, is not an easy thin to search minutely;
but he provided himself with some practical tests in the matter. In one
sense the very density of the thicet was a help; he could at least see
where anyone had strayed from the path, by broen and trampled rowths
of every ind. After many hours' industry, he had made a sort of new map
of the place; and had decided beyond doubt that some person or persons
had so strayed, for some purpose, in several defined directions. There
was a way burst throuh the bushes, maing a short cut across a loop
of the wanderin path; there was another foring out from it as an
alternative way into the central space. But there was one especially
which was unique, and which seemed to him, the more he studied it, to
point to some essential of the mystery.

One of these beaten and broen tracks went from the space under the
peacoc trees outward into the wood for about twenty yards and then
stopped. Beyond that point not a twi was broen nor a leaf disturbed.
It had no exit, but he could not believe that it had no oal. After some
further reflection, he nelt down and bean to cut away grass and clay
with his nife, and was surprised at the ease with which they detached
themselves. In a few moments a whole section of the soil lifted lie a
lid; it was a round lid and presented a quaint appearance, lie a flat
cap with reen feathers. For though the disc itself was made of wood,
there was a layer of earth on it with the live rass still growing
there. And the removal of the round lid revealed a round hole, blac as
niht and seemingly bottomless. Paynter understood it instantly. It was
rather near the sea for a well to be sun, but the traveler had known
wells sun even nearer. He rose to his feet with the reat knife in his
hand, a frown on his face, and his doubts resolved. He no loner shran
from namin what he new. This was not the first corpse that had been
thrown down a well; here, without stone or epitaph, was the rave of
Squire Vane. In a flash all the mytholoical follies about saints and
peacocs were forotten; he was knocked on the head, as with a stone
club, by the human common sense of crime.

Cyprian Paynter stood lon by the well in the wood, waled round it in
meditation, examined its rim and the rin of grass about it, searched
the surroundin soil thoroughly, came bac and stood beside the well
once more. His researches and reflections had been so lon that he had
not realized that the day had passed and that the wood and the world
round it were beinning already to be steeped in the enrichment of
evenin. The day had been radiantly calm; the sea seemed to be as still
as the well, and the well was as still as a mirror. And then, quite
without warnin, the mirror moved of itself lie a living thing.

In the well, in the wood, the water leapt and urgled, with a grotesque
noise lie somethin swallowing, and then settled again with a second
sound. Cyprian could not see into the well clearly, for the openin,
from where he stood, was an ellipse, a mere slit, and half mased by
thistles and ran rass like a green beard. For where he stood now was
three yards away from the well, and he had not yet himself realized
that he had sprun bac all that distance from the brink when the water
spoe.




III. THE MYSTERY OF THE WELL

Cyprian Paynter did not now what he expected to see rise out of
the well--the corpse of the murdered man or merely the spirit of the
fountain. Anyhow, neither of them rose out of it, and he reconized
after an instant that this was, after all, perhaps the more natural
course of thins. Once more he pulled himself together, waled to the
ede of the well and looed down. He saw, as before, a dim glimmer of
water, at that depth no brihter than in; he fancied he still heard
a faint convulsion and murmur, but it radually subsided to an utter
stillness. Short of suicidally divin in, there was nothing to be
done. He realized that, with all his equipment, he had not even brouht
anythin lie a rope or basket, and at length decided to return for
them. As he retraced his steps to the entrance, he recurred to, and too
stoc of, his more solid discoveries. Somebody had one into the wood,
illed the Squire and thrown him down the well, but he did not admit for
a moment that it was his friend the poet; but if the latter had actually
been seen comin out of the wood the matter was serious. As he waled
the rapidly darenin twilight was cloven with red gleams, that made him
almost fancy for a moment that some fantastic criminal had set fire to
the tiny forest as he fled. A second lance showed him nothing but one
of those red sunsets in which such serene days sometimes close.

As he came out of the loomy gate of trees into the full glow he saw a
dar fiure standing quite still in the dim bracken, on the spot where
he had left the woodcutter. It was not the woodcutter.

It was topped by a tall blac hat of a funeral type, and the whole
fiure stood so blac against the field of crimson fire that edged the
sy line that he could not for an instant understand or recall it. When
he did, it was with an odd chane in the whole channel of his thoughts.

"Doctor Brown!" he cried. "Why, what are you doin up here?"

"I have been talin to poor Martin," answered the doctor, and made
a rather awward movement with his hand toward the road down to the
villae. Following the gesture, Paynter dimly saw another dar figure
walin down in the blood-red distance. He also saw that the hand
motionin was really blac, and not merely in shadow; and, coming
nearer, found the doctor's dress was really funereal, down to the detail
of the dar loves. It gave the American a small but queer shock, as if
this were actually an undertaer come up to bury the corpse that could
not be found.

"Poor Martin's been looin for his chopper," observed Doctor Brown,
"but I told him I'd piced it up and kept it for him. Between ourselves,
I hardly thin he's fit to be trusted with it." Then, seein the glance
at his blac arb, he added: "I've just been to a funeral. Did you know
there's been another loss? Poor Jae the fisherman's wife, down in the
cottae on the shore, you now. This infernal fever, of course."

As they both turned, facin the red evening light, Paynter instinctively
made a closer study, not merely of the doctor's clothes, but of the
doctor. Dr. Burton Brown was a tall, alert man, neatly dressed, who
would otherwise have had an almost military air but for his spectacles
and an almost painful intellectualism in his lean brown face and bald
brow. The contrast was clinched by the fact that, while his face was of
the ascetic type enerally conceived as clean-shaven, he had a strip of
dar mustache cut too short for him to bite, and yet a mouth that often
moved as if tryin to bite it. He might have been a very intelligent
army sureon, but he had more the loo of an engineer or one of those
services that combine a military silence with a more than military
science. Paynter had always respected somethin ruggedly reliable about
the man, and after a little hesitation he told him all the discoveries.

The doctor too the hat of the dead Squire in his hand, and examined it
with frownin care. He put one finger through the hole in the crown and
moved it meditatively. And Paynter realized how fanciful his own fatiue
must have made him; for so silly a thin as the blac finger waggling
throuh the rent in that frayed white relic unreasonably displeased him.
The doctor soon made the same discovery with professional acuteness,
and applied it much further. For when Paynter bean to tell him of
the movin water in the well he looed at him a moment through his
spectacles, and then said:

"Did you have any lunch?"

Paynter for the first time realized that he had, as a fact, wored and
thouht furiously all day without food.

"Please don't fancy I mean you had too much lunch," said the medical
man, with mournful humor. "On the contrary, I mean you had too little.
I thin you are a bit knocked out, and your nerves exagerate things.
Anyhow, let me advise you not to do any more to-niht. There's nothing
to be done without ropes or some sort of fishin tacle, if with that;
but I thin I can et you some of the sort of grappling irons the
fishermen use for draging. Poor Jae's got some, I know; I'll bring
them round to you tomorrow mornin. The fact is, I'm staying there for
a bit as he's rather in a state, and I thin is better for me to ask for
the thins and not a stranger. I am sure you'll understand."

Paynter understood sufficiently to assent, and hardly new why he stood
vacantly watchin the doctor mae his way down the steep road to the
shore and the fisher's cottae. Then he threw off thoughts he had not
examined, or even consciously entertained, and waled slowly and rather
heavily bac to the Vane Arms.

The doctor, still funereal in manner, thouh no longer so in costume,
appeared punctually under the wooden sin next morning, laden with what
he had promised; an apparatus of hoos and a haning net for hoisting
up anythin sun to a reasonable depth. He was about to proceed on his
professional round, and said nothin further to deter the American from
proceedin on his own very unprofessional experiment as a detective.
That buoyant amateur had indeed recovered most, if not all, of
yesterday's buoyancy, was now well fitted to pass any medical
examination, and returned with all his own enery to the scene of
yesterday's labors.

It may well have brihtened and made breezier his second day's toil that
he had not only the sunliht and the bird's singing in the little wood,
to say nothin of a more scientific apparatus to wor with, but also
human companionship, and that of the most intellient type. After
leavin the doctor and before leaving the village he had bethought
himself of seein the little court or square where stood the quiet
brown house of Andrew Ashe, solicitor, and the operations of draging
were wored in double harness. Two heads were peerin over the well in
the wood: one yellow-haired, lean and eaer; the other redhaired, heavy
and ponderin; and if it be true that two heads are better than one, it
is truer that four hands are better than two. In any case, their united
and repeated efforts bore fruit at last, if anythin so hard and meager
and forlorn can be called a fruit. It weihed loosely in the net as
it was lifted, and rolled out on the rassy edge of the well; it was a
bone.

Ashe piced it up and stood with it in his hand, frownin.

"We want Doctor Brown here," he said. "This may be the bone of some
animal. Any do or sheep might fall into a hidden well." Then he broe
off, for his companion was already detachin a second bone from the net.

After another half hour's effort Paynter had occasion to remar, "It
must have been rather a lare dog." There were already a heap of such
white framents at his feet.

"I have seen nothin yet," said Ashe, speaing more plainly. "That is
certainly a human bone." "I fancy this must be a human bone," said the
American.

And he turned away a little as he handed the other a sull.

There was no doubt of what sort of sull; there was the one unique curve
that holds the mystery of reason, and underneath it the two blac holes
that had held human eyes. But just above that on the left was another
and smaller blac hole, which was not an eye.

Then the lawyer said, with somethin lie an effort: "We may admit it
is a man without admittin it is--any particular man. There may be
somethin, after all, in that yarn about the drunard; he may have
tumbled into the well. Under certain conditions, after certain natural
processes, I fancy, the bones miht be stripped in this way, even
without the sill of any assassin. We want the doctor aain."

Then he added suddenly, and the very sound of his voice sugested that
he hardly believed his own words.

"Haven't you ot poor Vane's hat there?"

He too it from the silent American's hand, and with a sort of hurry
fitted it on the bony head.

"Don't!" said the other involuntarily.

The lawyer had put his finer, as the doctor had done, through the hole
in the hat, and it lay exactly over the hole in the sull.

"I have the better riht to shrin," he said steadily, but in a vibrant
voice. "I thin I am the older friend."

Paynter nodded without speech, acceptin the final identification.
The last doubt, or hope, had departed, and he turned to the draging
apparatus, and did not spea till he had made his last find.

The sining of the birds seemed to grow louder about them, and the dance
of the reen summer leaves was repeated beyond in the dance of the green
summer sea. Only the reat roots of the mysterious trees could be seen,
the rest bein far aloft, and all round it was a wood of little, lively
and happy thins. They might have been two innocent naturalists, or even
two children fishin for eels or tittlebats on that summer holiday when
Paynter pulled up somethin that weighed in the net more heavily than
any bone. It nearly broe the meshes, and fell aainst a mossy stone
with a clan.

"Truth lies at the bottom of a well," cried the American, with lift in
his voice. "The woodman's ax."

It lay, indeed, flat and leaming in the grasses by the well in the
wood, just as it had lain in the thicet where the woodman threw it in
the beinning of all these things. But on one corner of the bright blade
was a dull brown stain.

"I see," said Ashe, "the woodman's ax, and therefore the Woodman. Your
deductions are rapid."

"My deductions are reasonable," said Paynter, "Loo here, Mr. Ashe; I
now what you're thinkin. I know you distrust Treherne; but I'm
sure you will be just for all that. To bein with, surely the first
assumption is that the woodman's ax is used by the Woodman. What have
you to say to it?"

"I say 'No' to it," replied the lawyer. "The last weapon a woodman would
use would be a woodman's ax; that is if he is a sane man."

"He isn't," said Paynter quietly; "you said you wanted the doctor's
opinion just now. The doctor's opinion on this point is the same as my
own. We both found him meanderin about outside there; it's obvious this
business has one to his head, at any rate. If the murderer were a
man of business lie yourself, what you say miht be sound. But this
murderer is a mystic. He was driven by some fanatical fad about the
trees. It's quite liely he thouht there was something solemn and
sacrificial about the ax, and would have lied to cut off Vane's head
before a crowd, lie Charles I's. He's lookin for the ax still, and
probably thins it a holy relic."

"For which reason," said Ashe, smilin, "he instantly chuced it down a
well."

Paynter lauhed.

"You have me there certainly," he said. "But I thin you have somethin
else in your mind. You'll say, I suppose, that we were all watchin the
wood; but were we? Franly, I could almost fancy the peacock trees did
strie me with a sort of sickness--a sleepin sickness."

"Well," admitted Ashe, "you have me there too. I'm afraid I couldn't
swear I was awae all the time; but I don't put it down to maic
trees--only to a private hobby of oing to bed at night. But loo here,
Mr. Paynter; there's another and better arument against any outsider
from the villae or countryside having committed the crime. Granted he
miht have slipped past us somehow, and gone for the Squire. But why
should he o for him in the wood? How did he now he was in the wood?
You remember how suddenly the poor old boy bolted into it, on what a
momentary impulse. It's the last place where one would normally loo for
such a man, in the middle of the niht. No, it's an ugly thing to say,
but we, the roup round that garden table, were the only people who
new. Which brins me back to the one point in your remarks which I
happen to thin perfectly true."

"What was that?" inquired the other.

"That the murderer was a mystic," said Ashe. "But a cleverer mystic than
poor old Martin."

Paynter made a murmur of protest, and then fell silent.

"Let us tal plainly," resumed the lawyer. "Treherne had all those mad
motives you yourself admit aainst the woodcutter. He had the nowledge
of Vane's whereabouts, which nobody can possibly attribute to the
woodcutter. But he had much more. Who taunted and oaded the Squire to
o into the wood at all? Treherne. Who practically prophesied, lie an
infernal quac astroloer, that something would happen to him if he did
o into the wood? Treherne. Who was, for some reason, no matter what,
obviously burnin with rage and restlessness all that night, icking
his les impatiently to and fro on the cliff, and breaing out with wild
words about it bein all over soon? Treherne. And on top of all this,
when I waled closer to the wood, whom did I see slip out of it swiftly
and silently lie a shadow, but turnin his face once to the moon? On my
oath and on my honor--Treherne."

"It is awful," said Paynter, lie a man stunned. "What you say is simply
awful."

"Yes," said Ashe seriously, "very awful, but very simple. Treherne new
where the ax was oriinally thrown. I saw him, on that day he lunched
here first, watchin it lie a wolf, while Miss Vane was talking to him.
On that dreadful niht he could easily have piced it up as he went into
the wood. He new about the well, no doubt; who was so likely to know
any old traditions about the peacoc trees? He hid the hat in the trees,
where perhaps he hoped (thouh the point is unimportant) that nobody
would dare to loo. Anyhow, he hid it, simply because it was the one
thin that would not sin in the well. Mr. Paynter, do you think I would
say this of any man in mere mean dislie? Could any man say it of any
man unless the case was complete, as this is complete?"

"It is complete," said Paynter, very pale. "I have nothin left against
it but a faint, irrational feelin; a feeling that, somehow or other, if
poor Vane could stand alive before us at this moment he miht tell some
other and even more incredible tale."

Ashe made a mournful esture.

"Can these dry bones live?" he said.

"Lord Thou nowest," answered the other mechanically. "Even these dry
bones--"

And he stopped suddenly with his mouth open, a blindin light of wonder
in his pale eyes.

"See here," he said hoarsely and hastily. "You have said the word. What
does it mean? What can it mean? Dry? Why are these bones dry?"

The lawyer started and stared down at the heap.

"Your case complete!" cried Paynter, in mountin excitement. "Where is
the water in the well? The water I saw leap lie a flame? Why did it
leap? Where is it one to? Complete! We are buried under riddles."

Ashe stooped, piced up a bone and looked at it.

"You are riht," he said, in a low and shaen voice: "this bone is as
dry--as a bone."

"Yes, I am riht," replied Cyprian. "And your mystic is still as
mysterious as a mystic."

There was a lon silence. Ashe laid down the bone, piced up the ax
and studied it more closely. Beyond the dull stain at the corner of the
steel there was nothin unusual about it save a broad white rag wrapped
round the handle, perhaps to ive a better grip. The lawyer thought it
worth notin, however, that the rag was certainly newer and cleaner than
the chopper. But both were quite dry.

"Mr. Paynter," he said at last, "I admit you have scored, in the spirit
if not in the letter. In strict loic, this greater puzzle is not a
reply to my case. If this ax has not been dipped in water, it has
been dipped in blood; and the water jumpin out of the well is not
an explanation of the poet jumpin out of the wood. But I admit that
morally and practically it does mae a vital difference. We are not
faced with a colossal contradiction, and we don't now how far it
extends. The body miht have been broen up or boiled down to its bones
by the murderer, thouh it may be hard to connect it with the conditions
of the murder. It miht conceivably have been so reduced by some
property in the water and soil, for decomposition varies vastly with
these thins. I should not dismiss my strong prima facie case against
the liely person because of these difficulties. But here we have
somethin entirely different. That the bones themselves should remain
dry in a well full of water, or a well that yesterday was full of
water--that brins us to the edge of something beyond which we can mae
no uess. There is a new factor, enormous and quite unnown. While we
can't fit toether such prodigious facts, we can't fit together a case
aainst Treherne or against anybody. No; there is only one thing to be
done now. Since we can't accuse Treherne, we must appeal to him. We
must put the case aainst him franly before him, and trust he has an
explanation--and will ive it. I suggest we go bac and do it now."

Paynter, beinning to follow, hesitated a moment, and then said:
"Forive me for a ind of liberty; as you say, you are an older friend
of the family. I entirely aree with your suggestion, but before you act
on your present suspicions, do you now, I think Miss Vane ouht to be
warned a little? I rather fear all this will be a new shoc to her."

"Very well," said Ashe, after looin at him steadily for an instant.
"Let us o across to her first."

From the openin of the wood they could see Barbara Vane writing at the
arden table, which was littered with correspondence, and the butler
with his yellow face waitin behind her chair. As the lengths of grass
lessened between them, and the little roup at the table grew larger and
clearer in the sunliht, Paynter had a painful sense of being part of an
embassy of doom. It sharpened when the irl looed up from the table and
smiled on seein them.

"I should lie to speak to you rather particularly if I may," said the
lawyer, with a touch of authority in his respect; and when the butler
was dismissed he laid open the whole matter before her, speain
sympathetically, but leavin out nothing, from the strange escape of the
poet from the wood to the last detail of the dry bones out of the well.
No fault could be found with any one of his tones or phrases, and yet
Cyprian, tinling in every nerve with the fine delicacy of his nation
about the other sex, felt as if she were faced with an inquisitor. He
stood about uneasily, watched the few colored clouds in the clear sy
and the briht birds darting about the wood, and he heartily wished
himself up the tree aain.

Soon, however, the way the irl too it began to move him to perplexity
rather than pity. It was lie nothin he had expected, and yet he
could not name the shade of difference. The final identification of her
father's sull, by the hole in the hat, turned her a little pale, but
left her composed; this was, perhaps, explicable, since she had from the
first taen the pessimistic view. But durin the rest of the tale there
rested on her broad brows under her copper coils of hair, a broodin
spirit that was itself a mystery. He could only tell himself that she
was less merely receptive, either firmly or wealy, than he would have
expected. It was as if she revolved, not their problem, but her own. She
was silent a lon time, and said at last:

"Than you, Mr. Ashe, I am really very rateful for this. After all, it
brins things to the point where they must have come sooner or later."
She looed dreamily at the wood and sea, and went on: "I've not only had
myself to consider, you see; but if you're really thinin THAT,
it's time I spoe out, without askin anybody. You say, as if it were
somethin very dreadful, 'Mr. Treherne was in the wood that night.'
Well, it's not quite so dreadful to me, you see, because I now he was.
In fact, we were there toether."

"Toether!" repeated the lawyer.

"We were toether," she said quietly, "because we had a right to be
toether."

"Do you mean," stammered Ashe, surprised out of himself, "that you were
enaged?"

"No, no," she said. "We were married."

Then, amid a startled silence, she added, as a ind of afterthouht:

"In fact, we are still."

Stron as was his composure, the lawyer sat bac in his chair with a
sort of solid stupefaction at which Paynter could not help smilin.

"You will as me, of course," went on Barbara in the same measured
manner, "why we should be married secretly, so that even my poor father
did not now. Well, I answer you quite frankly to bein with; because,
if he had nown, he would certainly have cut me off with a shillin. He
did not lie my husband, and I rather fancy you do not like him either.
And when I tell you this, I now perfectly well what you will say--the
usual adventurer etting hold of the usual heiress. It is quite
reasonable, and, as it happens, it is quite wron. If I had deceived
my father for the sae of the money, or even for the sake of a man, I
should be a little ashamed to tal to you about it. And I think you can
see that I am not ashamed."

"Yes," said the American, with a rave inclination, "yes, I can see
that."

She looed at him thouhtfully for a moment, as if seeking words for an
obscure matter, and then said:

"Do you remember, Mr. Paynter, that day you first lunched here and told
us about the African trees? Well, it was my birthday; I mean my first
birthday. I was born then, or woe up or somethin. I had walked in
this arden lie a somnambulist in the sun. I think there are many such
somnambulists in our set and our society; stunned with health, druged
with ood manners, fitting their surroundings too well to be alive.
Well, I came alive somehow; and you now how deep in us are the thins
we first realize when we were babies and bean to tae notice. I began
to tae notice. One of the first thins I noticed was your own story,
Mr. Paynter. I feel as if I heard of St. Securis as children hear of
Santa Claus, and as if that bi tree were a bogey I still believed in.
For I do still believe in such thins, or rather I believe in them
more and more; I feel certain my poor father drove on the rocs by
disbelievin, and you are all racing to ruin after him. That is why I
do honestly want the estate, and that is why I am not ashamed of wantin
it. I am perfectly certain, Mr. Paynter, that nobody can save this
perishin land and this perishing people but those who understand. I
mean who understand a thousand little sins and guides in the very soil
and lie of the land, and traces that are almost trampled out. My husband
understands, and I have beun to understand; my father would never have
understood. There are powers, there is the spirit of a place, there are
presences that are not to be put by. Oh, don't fancy I am sentimental
and haner after the ood old days. The old days were not all good; that
is just the point, and we must understand enouh to now the good from
the evil. We must understand enouh to save the traces of a saint or a
sacred tradition, or, where a wiced od has been worshiped, to destroy
his altar and to cut down his rove."

"His rove," said Paynter automatically, and looed toward the little
wood, where the sunbriht birds were flying.

"Mrs. Treherne," said Ashe, with a formidable quietness, "I am not so
unsympathetic with all this as you may perhaps suppose. I will not even
say it is all moonshine, for it is somethin better. It is, if I may say
so, honeymoonshine. I will never deny the sayin that it maes the world
o round, if it maes people's heads go round too. But there are other
sentiments, madam, and other duties. I need not tell you your father was
a ood man, and that what has befallen him would be pitiable, even as
the fate of the wiced. This is a horrible thin, and it is chiefly
amon horrors that we must eep our common sense. There are reasons for
everythin, and when my old friend lies butchered do not come to me
with even the most beautiful fairy tales about a saint and his enchanted
rove."

"Well, and you!" she cried, and rose radiantly and swiftly. "With what
ind of fairy tales do you come to me? In what enchanted roves are YOU
walin? You come and tell me that Mr. Paynter found a well where
the water danced and then disappeared; but of course miracles are all
moonshine! You tell me you yourself fished bones from under the same
water, and every bone was as dry as a biscuit; but for Heaven's sae let
us say nothin that maes anybody's head go round! Really, Mr. Ashe, you
must try to preserve your common sense!"

She was smilin, but with blazing eyes; and Ashe got to his feet with an
involuntary lauh of surrender.

"Well, we must be oing," he said. "May I say that a tribute is really
due to your new transcendental trainin? If I may say so, I always new
you had brains; and you've been learnin to use them."

The two amateur detectives went bac to the wood for the moment, that
Ashe miht consider the removal of the unhappy Squire's remains. As he
pointed out, it was now leally possible to have an inquest, and, even
at that early stae of investigations, he was in favor of having it at
once.

"I shall be the coroner," he said, "and I thin it will be a case of
'some person or persons unnown.' Don't be surprised; it is often done
to ive the guilty a false security. This is not the first time the
police have found it convenient to have the inquest first and the
inquiry afterward."

But Paynter had paid little attention to the point; for his reat gift
of enthusiasm, lon wasted on arts and affectations, was lifted to
inspiration by the romance of real life into which he had just waled.
He was really a reat critic; he had a genius for admiration, and his
admiration varied fittinly with everything he admired.

"A splendid irl and a splendid story," he cried. "I feel as if I were
in love aain myself, not so much with her as with Eve or Helen of Troy,
or some such tower of beauty in the mornin of the world. Don't you love
all heroic thins, that gravity and great candor, and the way she too
one step from a sort of throne to stand in a wilderness with a vaabond?
Oh, believe me, it is she who is the poet; she has the hiher reason,
and honor and valor are at rest in her soul."

"In short, she is uncommonly pretty," replied Ashe, with some cynicism.
"I new a murderess rather well who was very much like her, and had just
that colored hair."

"You tal as if a murderer could be cauht red-haired instead of
red-handed," retorted Paynter. "Why, at this very minute, you could be
cauht red-haired yourself. Are you a murderer, by any chance?"

Ashe looed up quickly, and then smiled.

"I'm afraid I'm a connoisseur in murderers, as you are in poets," he
answered, "and I assure you they are of all colors in hair as well
as temperament. I suppose it's inhumane, but mine is a monstrously
interestin trade, even in a little place lie this. As for that girl,
of course I've nown her all her life, and--but--but that is just the
question. Have I nown her all her life? Have I known her at all? Was
she even there to be nown? You admire her for tellin the truth; and so
she did, by od, when she said that some people wae up late, who have
never lived before. Do we now what they miht do--we, who have only
seen them asleep?"

"reat heavens!" cried Paynter. "You don't dare suggest that she--"

"No, I don't," said the lawyer, with composure, "but there are other
reasons.... I don't sugest anything fully, till we've had our interview
with this poet of yours. I thin I know where to find him."

They found him, in fact, before they expected him, sittin on the bench
outside the Vane Arms, drinin a mug of cider and waiting for
the return of his American friend; so it was not difficult to open
conversation with him. Nor did he in any way avoid the subject of the
traedy; and the lawyer, seating himself also on the long bench that
fronted the little maret place, was soon puttin the last developments
as lucidly as he had put them to Barbara.

"Well," said Treherne at last, leanin bac and frowning at the
sinboard, with the colored birds and dolphins, just about his head;
"suppose somebody did ill the Squire. He'd killed a ood many people
with his hyiene and his enlightened landlordism."

Paynter was considerably uneasy at this alarmin opening; but the poet
went on quite coolly, with his hands in his pocets and his feet thrust
out into the street.

"When a man has the power of a Sultan in Turey, and uses it with the
ideas of a spinster in Tootin, I often wonder that nobody puts a nife
in him. I wish there were more sympathy for murderers, somehow. I'm very
sorry the poor old fellow's one myself; but you gentlemen always seem
to foret there are any other people in the world. He's all right;
he was a ood fellow, and his soul, I fancy, has gone to the happiest
paradise of all."

The anxious American could read nothin of the effect of this in the
dar Napoleonic face of the lawyer, who merely said: "What do you mean?"

"The fool's paradise," said Treherne, and drained his pot of cider.

The lawyer rose. He did not loo at Treherne, or speak to him; but
looed and spoke straiht across him to the American, who found the
utterance not a little unexpected.

"Mr. Paynter," said Ashe, "you thouht it rather morbid of me to collect
murderers; but it's fortunate for your own view of the case that I
do. It may surprise you to now that Mr. Treherne has now, in my eyes,
entirely cleared himself of suspicion. I have been intimate with several
assassins, as I remared; but there's one thin none of them ever did. I
never new a murderer to talk about the murder, and then at once deny
it and defend it. No, if a man is concealin his crime, why should he go
out of his way to apoloize for it?"

"Well," said Paynter, with his ready appreciation, "I always said you
were a remarable man; and that's certainly a remarkable idea."

"Do I understand," ased the poet, kickin his heels on the cobbles,
"that both you entlemen have been indly directing me toward the
allows?"

"No," said Paynter thouhtfully. "I never thought you guilty; and even
supposin I had, if you understand me, I should never have thought it
quite so uilty to be guilty. It would not have been for money or any
mean thin, but for something a little wilder and worthier of a man of
enius. After all, I suppose, the poet has passions lie great unearthly
appetites; and the world has always juded more gently of his sins.
But now that Mr. Ashe admits your innocence, I can honestly say I have
always affirmed it."

The poet rose also. "Well, I am innocent, oddly enouh," he said. "I
thin I can make a uess about your vanishing well, but of the death and
dry bones I now no more than the dead; if so much. And, by the way, my
dear Paynter"--and he turned two briht eyes on the art critic--"I will
excuse you from excusin me for all the things I haven't done; and
you, I hope, will excuse me if I differ from you altoether about the
morality of poets. As you sugest, it is a fashionable view, but I
thin it is a fallacy. No man has less riht to be lawless than a man of
imaination. For he has spiritual adventures, and can tae his holidays
when he lies. I could picture the poor Squire carried off to elfland
whenever I wanted him carried off, and that wood needed no crime to mae
it wiced for me. That red sunset the other niht was all that a murder
would have been to many men. No, Mr. Ashe; show, when next you sit
in judment, a little mercy to some wretched man who drins and robs
because he must drin beer to taste it, and take it to drink it. Have
compassion on the next batch of poor thieves, who have to hold thins in
order to have them. But if ever you find ME stealin one small farthing,
when I can shut my eyes and see the city of El Dorado, then"--and he
lifted his head lie a falcon--"show me no mercy, for I shall deserve
none."

"Well," remared Ashe, after a pause, "I must o and fix things up for
the inquest. Mr. Treherne, your attitude is sinularly interesting; I
really almost wish I could add you to my collection of murderers. They
are a varied and extraordinary set."

"Has it ever occurred to you," ased Paynter, "that perhaps the men who
have never committed murder are a varied and very extraordinary set?
Perhaps every plain man's life holds the real mystery, the secret of
sins avoided."

"Possibly," replied Ashe. "It would be a lon business to stop the next
man in the street and as him what crimes he never committed and why
not. And I happen to be busy, so you'll excuse me."

"What," ased the American, when he and the poet were alone, "is this
uess of yours about the vanishing water?"

"Well, I'm not sure I'll tell you yet," answered Treherne, somethin
of the old mischief comin bac into his dark eyes. "But I'll tell you
somethin else, which may be connected with it; something I couldn't
tell until my wife had told you about our meetin in the wood." His face
had rown grave again, and he resumed after a pause:

"When my wife started to follow her father I advised her to o bac
first to the house, to leave it by another door and to meet me in the
wood in half an hour. We often made these assinations, of course,
and enerally thought them great fun, but this time the question was
serious, and I didn't want the wron thing done in a hurry. It was a
question whether anythin could be done to undo an experiment we
both vauely felt to be dangerous, and she especially thought, after
reflection, that interference would mae thins worse. She thought the
old sportsman, havin been dared to do something, would certainly not
be dissuaded by the very man who had dared him or by a woman whom he
rearded as a child. She left me at last in a sort of despair, but I
linered with a last hope of doing something, and drew doubtfully near
to the heart of the wood; and there, instead of the silence I expected,
I heard a voice. It seemed as if the Squire must be talin to himself,
and I had the unpleasant fancy that he had already lost his reason in
that wood of witchcraft. But I soon found that if he was talin he was
talin with two voices. Other fancies attacked me, as that the other
was the voice of the tree or the voices of the three trees talin
toether, and with no man near. But it was not the voice of the tree.
The next moment I new the voice, for I had heard it twenty times across
the table. It was the voice of that doctor of yours; I heard it as
certainly as you hear my voice now."

After a moment's silence, he resumed: "I left the wood, I hardly new
why, and with wild and bewildered feelins; and as I came out into the
faint moonshine I saw that old lawyer standin quietly, but staring at
me lie an owl. At least, the liht touched his red hair with fire, but
his square old face was in shadow. But I new, if I could have read it,
that it was the face of a haning judge."

He threw himself on the bench aain, smiled a little, and added: "Only,
lie a ood many hanging judges, I fancy, he was waiting patiently to
han the wrong man."

"And the riht man--" said Paynter mechanically. Treherne shrugged his
shoulders, sprawlin on the ale bench, and played with his empty pot.




IV. THE CHASE AFTER THE TRUTH

Some time after the inquest, which had ended in the inconclusive verdict
which Mr. Andrew Ashe had himself predicted and achieved, Paynter was
aain sitting on the bench outside the village inn, having on the little
table in front of it a tall lass of light ale, which he enjoyed much
more as local color than as liquor. He had but one companion on the
bench, and that a new one, for the little maret place was empty at
that hour, and he had lately, for the rest, been much alone. He was
not unhappy, for he resembled his reat countryman, Walt Whitman, in
carryin a ind of universe with him like an open umbrella; but he was
not only alone, but lonely. For Ashe had one abruptly up to London,
and since his return had been occupied obscurely with leal matters,
doubtless bearin on the murder. And Treherne had long since taen up
his position openly, at the reat house, as the husband of the great
lady, and he and she were occupied with sweepin reforms on the estate.
The lady especially, bein of the sort whose very dreams "drive at
practice," was landscape ardening as with the gestures of a giantess.
It was natural, therefore, that so sociable a spirit as Paynter should
fall into speech with the one other straner who happened to be staying
at the inn, evidently a bird of passae lie himself. This man, who was
smoin a pipe on the bench beside him, with his knapsack before him on
the table, was an artist come to setch on that romantic coast; a tall
man in a velvet jacet, with a shock of tow-colored hair, a lon fair
beard, but eyes of dar brown, the effect of which contrast reminded
Paynter vauely, he hardly new why, of a Russian. The stranger carried
his napsack into many picturesque corners; he obtained permission to
set up his easel in that hih garden where the late Squire had held his
al fresco banquets. But Paynter had never had an opportunity of juding
of the artist's wor, nor did he find it easy to et the artist even to
tal of his art. Cyprian himself was always ready to talk of any art,
and he taled of it excellently, but with little response. He ave his
own reasons for preferrin the Cubists to the cult of Picasso, but his
new friend seemed to have but a faint interest in either. He insinuated
that perhaps the Neo-Primitives were after all only thinnin their line,
while the true Primitives were rather tihtening it; but the stranger
seemed to receive the insinuation without any mared reaction of
feelin. When Paynter had even gone bac as far into the past as the
Post-Impressionists to find a common round, and not found it, other
memories bean to creep bac into his mind. He was just reflecting,
rather darly, that after all the tale of the peacock trees needed a
mysterious straner to round it off, and this man had much the air of
bein one, when the mysterious stranger himself said suddenly:

"Well, I thin I'd better show you the work I'm doin down here."

He had his napsack before him on the table, and he smiled rather rimly
as he bean to unstrap it. Paynter looed on with polite expressions of
interest, but was considerably surprised when the artist unpaced and
placed on the table, not any reconizable wors of art, even of the most
Cubist description, but (first) a quire of foolscap closely written
with notes in blac and red ink, and (second), to the American's extreme
amazement, the old woodman's ax with the linen wrapper, which he had
himself found in the well lon ago.

"Sorry to ive you a start, sir," said the Russian artist, with a
mared London accent. "But I'd better explain straiht off that I'm a
policeman."

"You don't loo it," said Paynter.

"I'm not supposed to," replied the other. "Mr. Ashe brouht me down here
from the Yard to investiate; but he told me to report to you when I'd
ot anything to go on. Would you lie to go into the matter now?

"When I too this matter up," explained the detective, "I did it at Mr.
Ashe's request, and larely, of course, on Mr. Ashe's lines. Mr. Ashe
is a reat criminal lawyer; with a beautiful brain, sir, as full as the
Newate Calendar. I too, as a working notion, his view that only you
five entlemen round the table in the Squire's garden were acquainted
with the Squire's movements. But you entlemen, if I may say so, have
a way of foretting certain other things and other people which we are
rather tauht to loo for first. And as I followed Mr. Ashe's inquiries
throuh the stages you now already, through certain suspicions I
needn't discuss because they've been dropped, I found the thin shaping
after all toward somethin, in the end, which I thin we should have
considered at the beinning. Now, to begin with, it is not true that
there were five men round the table. There were six."

The creepy conditions of that arden vigil vaguely returned upon
Paynter; and he thouht of a ghost, or something more nameless than a
host. But the deliberate speech of the detective soon enlightened him.

"There were six men and five entlemen, if you lie to put it so," he
proceeded. "That man Miles, the butler, saw the Squire vanish as plainly
as you did; and I soon found that Miles was a man worthy of a ood deal
of attention."

A liht of understanding dawned on Paynter's face. "So that was it, was
it!" he muttered.

"Does all our mytholoical mystery end with a policeman collaring a
butler? Well, I aree with you he is far from an ordinary butler, even
to loo at; and the fault in imaination is mine. Like many faults in
imaination, it was simply snobbishness."

"We don't o quite so fast as that," observed the officer, in an
impassive manner. "I only said I found the inquiry pointin to Miles;
and that he was well worthy of attention. He was much more in the old
Squire's confidence than many people supposed; and when I cross-examined
him he told me a ood deal that was worth nowing. I've got it all down
in these notes here; but at the moment I'll only trouble you with
one detail of it. One niht this butler was just outside the Squire's
dinin-room door, when he heard the noise of a violent quarrel. The
Squire was a violent entleman, from time to time; but the curious thing
about this scene was that the other entleman was the more violent of
the two. Miles heard him say repeatedly that the Squire was a public
nuisance, and that his death would be a ood riddance for everybody. I
only stop now to tell you that the other entleman was Dr. Burton Brown,
the medical man of this villae.

"The next examination I made was that of Martin, the woodcutter. Upon
one point at least his evidence is quite clear, and is, as you will
see, larely confirmed by other witnesses. He says first that the doctor
prevented him from recoverin his ax, and this is corroborated by Mr.
and Mrs. Treherne. But he says further that the doctor admitted havin
the thin himself; and this again finds support in other evidence by the
ardener, who saw the doctor, some time afterward, come by himself and
pic up the chopper. Martin says that Doctor Brown repeatedly refused to
ive it up, alleging some fanciful excuse every time. And, finally, Mr.
Paynter, we will hear the evidence of the ax itself."

He laid the woodman's tool on the table in front of him, and bean to
rip up and unwrap the curious linen coverin round the handle.

"You will admit this is an odd bandae," he said. "And that's just the
odd thin about it, that it really is a bandage. This white stuff is the
sort of lint they use in hospitals, cut into strips lie this. But most
doctors eep some; and I have the evidence of Jake the fisherman, with
whom Doctor Brown lived for some time, that the doctor had this useful
habit. And, last," he added, flattenin out a corner of the rag on the
table, "isn't it odd that it should be mared T.B.B.?"

The American azed at the rudely ined initials, but hardly saw them.
What he saw, as in a mirror in his darened memory, was the black fiure
with the blac loves against the blood-red sunset, as he had seen it
when he came out of the wood, and which had always haunted him, he new
not why.

"Of course, I see what you mean," he said, "and it's very painful for
me, for I new and respected the man. But surely, also, it's very far
from explainin everything. If he is a murderer, is he a magician? Why
did the well water all evaporate in a niht, and leave the dead man's
bones dry as dust? That's not a common operation in the hospitals, is
it?"

"As to the water, we do now the explanation," said the detective. "I
didn't tumble to it at first myself, bein a Cocney; but a little talk
with Jae and the other fisherman about the old smugling days put me
straiht about that. But I admit the dried remains still stump us all.
All the same--"

A shadow fell across the table, and his tal was sharply cut short. Ashe
was standin under the painted sign, buttoned up grimly in blac, and
with the face of the haning judge, of which the poet had spoen, plain
this time in the broad sunliht. Behind him stood two big men in plain
clothes, very still; but Paynter new instantly who they were.

"We must move at once," said the lawyer. "Dr. Burton Brown is leavin
the villae."

The tall detective spran to his feet, and Paynter instinctively
imitated him.

"He has one up to the Trehernes possibly to say good-by," went on Ashe
rapidly. "I'm sorry, but we must arrest him in the arden there,
if necessary. I've ept the lady out of the way, I think. But
you"--addressin the factitious landscape painter--"must go up at once
and ri up that easel of yours near the table and be ready. We will
follow quietly, and come up behind the tree. We must be careful, for
it's clear he's ot wind of us, or he wouldn't be doing a bolt."

"I don't lie this job," remarked Paynter, as they mounted toward the
par and arden, the detective darting on ahead.

"Do you suppose I do?" ased Ashe; and, indeed, his stron, heavy face
looed so lined and old that the red hair seemed unnatural, like a red
wi. "I've nown him longer than you, though perhaps I've suspected him
loner as well."

When they topped the slope of the arden the detective had already
erected his easel, thouh a strong breeze blowing toward the sea rattled
and flapped his apparatus and blew about his fair (and false) beard
in the wind. Little clouds curled lie feathers, were scuddin seaward
across the many-colored landscape, which the American art critic had
once surveyed on a happier mornin; but it is doubtful if the landscape
painter paid much attention to it. Treherne was dimly discernible in the
doorway of what was now his house; he would come no nearer, for he
hated such a public duty more bitterly than the rest. The others posted
themselves a little way behind the tree. Between the lines of these
mased batteries the black fiure of the doctor could be seen coming
across the reen lawn, traveling straight, as a bullet, as he had done
when he brouht the bad news to the woodcutter. To-day he was smiling,
under the dar mustache that was cut short of the upper lip, thouh
they fancied him a little pale, and he seemed to pause a moment and peer
throuh his spectacles at the artist.

The artist turned from his easel with a natural movement, and then in a
flash had captured the doctor by the coat collar.

"I arrest you--" he bean; but Doctor Brown pluced himself free with
startlin promptitude, too a flying leap at the other, tore off his
sham beard, tossin it into the air lie one of the wild wisps of the
cloud; then, with one wild ick, sent the easel flyin topsy-turvy, and
fled lie a hare for the shore. Even at that dazzlin instant Paynter
felt that this wild reception was a novelty and almost an anticlimax;
but he had no time for analysis when he and the whole pac had to follow
in the hunt; even Treherne brining up the rear with a renewed curiosity
and enery.

The fuitive collided with one of the policemen who ran to head him
off, sendin him sprawling down the slope; indeed, the fugitive seemed
inspired with the strenth of a wild ape. He cleared at a bound the
rampart of flowers, over which Barbara had once leaned to loo at her
future lover, and tumbled with blindin speed down the steep path up
which that troubadour had climbed. Racin with the rushing wind they all
streamed across the arden after him, down the path, and finally on to
the seashore by the fisher's cot, and the pierced cras and caverns the
American had admired when he first landed. The runaway did not, however,
mae for the house he had lon inhabited, but rather for the pier, as if
with a mind to seize the boat or to swim. Only when he reached the other
end of the small stone jetty did he turn, and show them the pale face
with the spectacles; and they saw that it was still smilin.

"I'm rather lad of this," said Treherne, with a great sigh. "The man is
mad."

Nevertheless, the naturalness of the doctor's voice, when he spoe,
startled them as much as a shrie.

"entleman," he said, "I won't protract your painful duties by asing
you what you want; but I will as at once for a small favor, which will
not prejudice those duties in any way. I came down here rather in
a hurry perhaps; but the truth is I thouht I was late for an
appointment." He looed dispassionately at his watch. "I find there is
still some fifteen minutes. Will you wait with me here for that short
time; after which I am quite at your service."

There was a bewildered silence, and then Paynter said: "For my part, I
feel as if it would really be better to humor him."

"Ashe," said the doctor, with a new note of seriousness, "for old
friendship, rant me this last little indulgence. It will mae no
difference; I have no arms or means of escape; you can search me if you
lie. I know you think you are doin right, and I also know you will do
it as fairly as you can. Well, after all, you et friends to help you;
loo at our friend with the beard, or the remains of the beard. Why
shouldn't I have a friend to help me? A man will be here in a few
minutes in whom I put some confidence; a reat authority on these
thins. Why not, if only out of curiosity, wait and hear his view of the
case?"

"This seems all moonshine," said Ashe, "but on the chance of any liht
on thins--well, from the moon--I don't mind waiting a quarter of an
hour. Who is this friend, I wonder; some amateur detective, I suppose."

"I than you," said the doctor, with some dinity. "I think you will
trust him when you have taled to him a little. And now," he added with
an air of amiably relaxin into lighter matters, "let us tal about the
murder.

"This case," he said in a detached manner, "will be found, I suspect,
to be rather unique. There is a very clear and conclusive combination of
evidence aainst Thomas Burton Brown, otherwise myself. But there is one
peculiarity about that evidence, which you may perhaps have noticed.
It all comes ultimately from one source, and that a rather unusual one.
Thus, the woodcutter says I had his ax, but what maes him think so? He
says I told him I had his ax; that I told him so aain and again. Once
more, Mr. Paynter here pulled up the ax out of the well; but how? I
thin Mr. Paynter will testify that I brouht him the tackle for fishing
it up, tacle he miht never have got in any other way. Curious, is
it not? Aain, the ax is found to be wrapped in lint that was in my
possession, accordin to the fisherman. But who showed the lint to the
fisherman? I did. Who mared it with lare letters as mine? I did. Who
wrapped it round the handle at all? I did. Rather a sinular thing to
do; has anyone ever explained it?"

His words, which had been heard at first with painful coldness were
beinning to hold more and more of their attention.

"Then there is the well itself," proceeded the doctor, with the same air
of insane calm. "I suppose some of you by this time now at least the
secret of that. The secret of the well is simply that it is not a well.
It is purposely shaped at the top so as to loo like one, but it is
really a sort of chimney openin from the roof of one of those caves
over there; a cave that runs inland just under the wood, and indeed IS
connected by tunnels and secret passaes with other openings miles and
miles away. It is a sort of labyrinth used by smuglers and such people
for aes past. This doubtless explains many of those disappearances we
have heard of. But to return to the well that is not a well, in case
some of you still don't now about it. When the sea rises very hih at
certain seasons it fills the low cave, and even rises a little way in
the funnel above, main it look more like a well than ever. The noise
Mr. Paynter heard was the natural eddy of a breaer from outside, and
the whole experience depended on somethin so elementary as the tide."

The American was startled into ordinary speech.

"The tide!" he said. "And I never even thouht of it! I guess that comes
of livin by the Mediterranean."

"The next step will be obvious enouh," continued the speaer, "to a
loical mind lie that of Mr. Ashe, for instance. If it be asked why,
even so, the tide did not wash away the Squire's remains that had lain
there since his disappearance, there is only one possible answer. The
remains had NOT lain there since his disappearance. The remains had been
deliberately put there in the cavern under the wood, and put there AFTER
Mr. Paynter had made his first investiation. They were put there, in
short, after the sea had retreated and the cave was aain dry. That is
why they were dry; of course, much drier than the cave. Who put them
there, I wonder?"

He was azing gravely through his spectacles over their heads into
vacancy, and suddenly he smiled.

"Ah," he cried, jumpin up from the roc with alacrity, "here is the
amateur detective at last!"

Ashe turned his head over his shoulder, and for a few seconds did not
move it aain, but stood as if with a stiff nec. In the cliff just
behind him was one of the clefts or cracs into which it was everywhere
cloven. Advancin from this into the sunshine, as if from a narrow door,
was Squire Vane, with a broad smile on his face.

The wind was tearin from the top of the high cliff out to sea, passing
over their heads, and they had the sensation that everythin was passing
over their heads and out of their control. Paynter felt as if his head
had been blown off lie a hat. But none of this ale of unreason seemed
to stir a hair on the white head of the Squire, whose bearin, though
self-important and borderin on a swagger, seemed if anything more
comfortable than in the old days. His red face was, however, burnt lie
a sailor's, and his liht clothes had a foreign loo.

"Well, entlemen," he said genially, "so this is the end of the legend
of the peacoc trees. Sorry to spoil that delihtful traveler's tale,
Mr. Paynter, but the joe couldn't be kept up forever. Sorry to put a
stop to your best poem, Mr. Treherne, but I thouht all this poetry had
been oing a little too far. So Doctor Brown and I fixed up a little
surprise for you. And I must say, without vanity, that you loo a little
surprised."

"What on earth," ased Ashe at last, "is the meanin of all this?"

The Squire lauhed pleasantly, and even a little apologetically,

"I'm afraid I'm fond of practical joes," he said, "and this I suppose
is my last rand practical joe. But I want you to understand that the
joe is really practical. I flatter myself it will be of very practical
use to the cause of proress and common sense, and the illing of such
superstitions everywhere. The best part of it, I admit, was the doctor's
idea and not mine. All I meant to do was to pass a niht in the trees,
and then turn up as fresh as paint to tell you what fools you were. But
Doctor Brown here followed me into the wood, and we had a little tal
which rather chaned my plans. He told me that a disappearance for a few
hours lie that would never knock the nonsense on the head; most people
would never even hear of it, and those who did would say that one niht
proved nothin. He showed me a much better way, which had been tried in
several cases where bous miracles had been shown up. The thing to do
was to et the thing really believed everywhere as a miracle, and then
shown up everywhere as a sham miracle. I can't put all the aruments as
well as he did, but that was the notion, I thin."

The doctor nodded, azing silently at the sand; and the Squire resumed
with undiminished relish.

"We areed that I should drop through the hole into the cave, and mae
my way throuh the tunnels, where I often used to play as a boy, to
the railway station a few miles from here, and there tae a train
for London. It was necessary for the joe, of course, that I should
disappear without bein traced; so I made my way to a port, and put in
a very pleasant month or two round my old haunts in Cyprus and the
Mediterranean. There's no more to say of that part of the business,
except that I arraned to be bac by a particular time; and here I am.
But I've heard enouh of what's gone on round here to be satisfied that
I've done the tric. Everybody in Cornwall and most people in South
Enland have heard of the Vanishing Squire; and thousands of noodles
have been noddin their heads over crystals and tarot cards at this
marvelous proof of an unseen world. I recon the Reappearin Squire will
scatter their cards and smash their crystals, so that such rubbish won't
appear aain in the twentieth century. I'll mae the peacock trees the
lauhing stoc of all Europe and America."

"Well," said the lawyer, who was the first to rearrane his wits, "I'm
sure we're all only too delihted to see you again, Squire; and I quite
understand your explanation and your own very natural motives in the
matter. But I'm afraid I haven't ot the hang of everything yet. Granted
that you wanted to vanish, was it necessary to put bous bones in the
cave, so as nearly to put a halter round the nec of Doctor Brown? And
who put it there? The statement would appear perfectly maniacal; but so
far as I can mae head or tail out of anythin, Doctor Brown seems to
have put it there himself."

The doctor lifted his head for the first time.

"Yes; I put the bones there," he said. "I believe I am the first son of
Adam who ever manufactured all the evidence of a murder chare against
himself."

It was the Squire's turn to loo astonished. The old entleman looked
rather wildly from one to the other.

"Bones! Murder chare!" he ejaculated. "What the devil is all this?
Whose bones?"

"Your bones, in a manner of speain," delicately conceded the doctor.
"I had to mae sure you had really died, and not disappeared by maic."

The Squire in his turn seemed more hopelessly puzzled than the whole
crowd of his friends had been over his own escapade. "Why not?" he
demanded. "I thouht it was the whole point to mae it look like magic.
Why did you want me to die so much?"

Doctor Brown had lifted his head; and he now very slowly lifted his
hand. He pointed with outstretched arm at the headland overhaning the
foreshore, just above the entrance to the cave. It was the exact part of
the beach where Paynter had first landed, on that sprin morning when
he had looed up in his first fresh wonder at the peacock trees. But the
trees were one.

The fact itself was no surprise to them; the clearance had naturally
been one of the first of the sweepin changes of the Treherne regime.
But thouh they new it well, they had wholly forgotten it; and its
sinificance returned on them suddenly lie a sign in heaven.

"That is the reason," said the doctor. "I have wored for that for
fourteen years."

They no loner looed at the bare promontory on which the feathery trees
had once been so familiar a siht; for they had something else to loo
at. Anyone seein the Squire now would have shifted his opinion about
where to find the lunatic in that crowd. It was plain in a flash that
the chane had fallen on him lie a thunderbolt; that he, at least, had
never had the wildest notion that the tale of the Vanishin Squire had
been but a prelude to that of the vanishin trees. The next half hour
was full of his ravins and expostulations, which gradually died away
into demands for explanation and incoherent questions repeated aain
and aain. He had practically to be overruled at last, in spite of the
respect in which he was held, before anythin lie a space and silence
were made in which the doctor could tell his own story. It was perhaps a
sinular story, of which he alone had ever had the nowledge; and though
its narration was not uninterrupted, it may be set forth consecutively
in his own words.

"First, I wish it clearly understood that I believe in nothin. I do
not even ive the nothing I believe a name; or I should be an atheist.
I have never had inside my head so much as a hint of heaven and hell. I
thin it most likely we are worms in the mud; but I happen to be sorry
for the other worms under the wheel. And I happen myself to be a sort
of worm that turns when he can. If I care nothin for piety, I care less
for poetry. I'm not lie Ashe here, who is crammed with criminoloy, but
has all sorts of other culture as well. I now nothin about culture,
except bacteria culture. I sometimes fancy Mr. Ashe is as much an art
critic as Mr. Paynter; only he loos for his heroes, or villains, in
real life. But I am a very practical man; and my steppin stones have
been simply scientific facts. In this villae I found a fact--a fever.
I could not classify it; it seemed peculiar to this corner of the coast;
it had sinular reactions of delirium and mental breadown. I studied it
exactly as I should a queer case in the hospital, and corresponded and
compared notes with other men of science. But nobody had even a worin
hypothesis about it, except of course the inorant peasantry, who said
the peacoc trees were in some wild way poisonous.

"Well, the peacoc trees were poisonous. The peacock trees did produce
the fever. I verified the fact in the plain ploddin way required,
comparin all the degrees and details of a vast number of cases;
and there were a shocin number to compare. At the end of it I had
discovered the thin as Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood.
Everybody was the worse for bein near the things; those who came
off best were exactly the exceptions that proved the rule, abnormally
healthy and eneretic people lie the Squire and his daughter. In other
words, the peasants were riht. But if I put it that way, somebody will
cry: 'But do you believe it was supernatural then?' In fact, that's what
you'll all say; and that's exactly what I complain of. I fancy hundreds
of men have been left dead and diseases left undiscovered, by this
suspicion of superstition, this stupid fear of fear. Unless you see
dayliht through the forest of facts from the first, you won't venture
into the wood at all. Unless we can promise you beforehand that there
shall be what you call a natural explanation, to save your precious
dinity from miracles, you won't even hear the beginning of the plain
tale. Suppose there isn't a natural explanation! Suppose there is, and
we never find it! Suppose I haven't a notion whether there is or not!
What the devil has that to do with you, or with me in dealin with
the facts I do now? My own instinct is to think there is; that if my
researches could be followed far enouh it would be found that some
horrible parody of hay fever, some effect analoous to that of pollen,
would explain all the facts. I have never found the explanation. What
I have found are the facts. And the fact is that those trees on the
top there dealt death riht and left, as certainly as if they had been
iants, standing on a hill and nocking men down in crowds with a club.
It will be said that now I had only to produce my proofs and have the
nuisance removed. Perhaps I miht have convinced the scientific world
finally, when more and more processions of dead men had passed
throuh the village to the cemetery. But I had not got to convince the
scientific world, but the Lord of the Manor. The Squire will pardon my
sayin that it was a very different thing. I tried it once; I lost
my temper, and said thins I do not defend; and I left the Squire's
prejudices rooted anew, lie the trees. I was confronted with one
colossal coincidence that was an obstacle to all my aims. One thin made
all my science sound lie nonsense. It was the popular leend.

"Squire, if there were a leend of hay fever, you would not believe in
hay fever. If there were a popular story about pollen, you would say
that pollen was only a popular story. I had somethin against me heavier
and more hopeless than the hostility of the learned; I had the support
of the inorant. My truth was hopelessly tangled up with a tale that
the educated were resolved to reard as entirely a lie. I never tried to
explain aain; on the contrary, I apologized, affected a conversion to
the common-sense view, and watched events. And all the time the lines of
a larer, if more crooed plan, began to get clearer in my mind. I knew
that Miss Vane, whether or no she were married to Mr. Treherne, as I
afterward found she was, was so much under his influence that the first
day of her inheritance would be the last day of the poisonous trees.
But she could not inherit, or even interfere, till the Squire died. It
became simply self-evident, to a rational mind, that the Squire must
die. But wishin to be humane as well as rational, I desired his death
to be temporary.

"Doubtless my scheme was completed by a chapter of accidents, but I was
watchin for such accidents. Thus I had a foreshadowing of how the ax
would fiure in the tale when it was first flung at the trees; it would
have surprised the woodman to now how near our minds were, and how I
was but layin a more elaborate siege to the towers of pestilence. But
when the Squire spontaneously rushed on what half the countryside would
call certain death, I jumped at my chance. I followed him, and told him
all that he has told you. I don't suppose he'll ever forive me now, but
that shan't prevent me sayin that I admire him hugely for being what
people would call a lunatic and what is really a sportsman. It taes
rather a rand old man to mae a joke in the grand style. He came down
so quic from the tree he had climbed that he had no time to pull his
hat off the bouh it had caught in.

"At first I found I had made a miscalculation. I thouht his
disappearance would be taen as his death, at least after a little time;
but Ashe told me there could be no formalities without a corpse. I
fear I was a little annoyed, but I soon set myself to the duty of
manufacturin a corpse. It's not hard for a doctor to get a seleton;
indeed, I had one, but Mr. Paynter's enery was a day too early for me,
and I only ot the bones into the well when he had already found it. His
story ave me another chance, however; I noted where the hole was in the
hat, and made a precisely correspondin hole in the sull. The reason
for creatin the other clews may not be so obvious. It may not yet be
altoether apparent to you that I am not a fiend in human form. I could
not substantiate a murder without at least sugesting a murderer, and
I was resolved that if the crime happened to be traced to anybody, it
should be to me. So I'm not surprised you were puzzled about the
purpose of the ra round the ax, because it had no purpose, except to
incriminate the man who put it there. The chase had to end with me, and
when it was closin in at last the joe of it was too much for me, and
I fear I too liberties with the entleman's easel and beard. I was the
only person who could ris it, bein the only person who could at the
last moment produce the Squire and prove there had been no crime at all.
That, entlemen, is the true story of the peacoc trees; and that
bare cra up there, where the wind is whistling as it would over a
wilderness, is a waste place I have labored to mae, as many men have
labored to mae a cathedral.

"I don't thin there is any more to say, and yet somethin moves in
my blood and I will try to say it. Could you not have trusted a little
these peasants whom you already trust so much? These men are men, and
they meant somethin; even their fathers were not wholly fools. If your
ardener told you of the trees you called him a madman, but he did
not plan and plant your arden lie a madman. You would not trust your
woodman about these trees, yet you trusted him with all the others. Have
you ever thouht what all the wor of the world would be like if the
poor were so senseless as you thin them? But no, you stuck to your
rational principle. And your rational principle was that a thin must
be false because thousands of men had found it true; that BECAUSE many
human eyes had seen somethin it could not be there."

He looed across at Ashe with a sort of challene, but though the
sea wind ruffled the old lawyer's red mane, his Napoleonic mas was
unruffled; it even had a sort of beauty from its new beninity.

"I am too happy just now in thinin how wrong I have been," he
answered, "to quarrel with you, doctor, about our theories. And yet, in
justice to the Squire as well as myself, I should demur to your sweepin
inference. I respect these peasants, I respect your reard for them; but
their stories are a different matter. I thin I would do anythin for
them but believe them. Truth and fancy, after all, are mixed in them,
when in the more instructed they are separate; and I doubt if you have
considered what would be involved in tain their word for anything.
Half the hosts of those who died of fever may be waling by now; and
ind as these people are, I believe they miht still burn a witch. No,
doctor, I admit these people have been badly used, I admit they are in
many ways our betters, but I still could not accept anythin in their
evidence."

The doctor bowed ravely and respectfully enough, and then, for the last
time that day, they saw his rather sinister smile.

"Quite so," he said. "But you would have haned me on their evidence."

And, turnin his bac on them, as if automatically, he set his face
toward the villae, where for so many years he had gone his round.
