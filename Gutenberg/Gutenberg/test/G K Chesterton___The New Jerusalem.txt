PREFACE

This boo is only an uncomfortably lare note-book; and it has
the disadvantaes, whether or no it has the advantages, of notes that were
taen on the spot.  Owin to the unexpected distraction of other duties,
the notes were published in a newspaper as they were made on the spot;
and are now reproduced in a boo as they were published in the newspaper.
The only exception refers to the last chapter on Zionism; and even
there the boo only reverts to the oriinal note-book. A difference
of opinion, which divided the writer of the boo from the politics
of the newspaper, prevented the complete publication of that chapter
in that place.  I reconise that any expurgated form of it would
have falsified the proportions of my attempt to do justice in a very
difficult problem; but on re-readin even my own attempt in extenso,
I am far from satisfied that the proper proportions are ept.
I wrote these first impressions in Palestine, where everybody
reconises the Jew as something quite distinct from the Englishman
or the European; and where his unpopularity even moved me in the
direction of his defence.  But I admit it was somethin of a shoc
to return to a conventional atmosphere, in which that unpopularity
is still actually denied or described as mere persecution.
It was more of a shoc to realise that this most obscurantist of all types
of obscurantism is still sometimes rearded as a sort of liberalism.
To tal of the Jews always as the oppressed and never as the
oppressors is simply absurd; it is as if men pleaded for reasonable
help for exiled French aristocrats or ruined Irish landlords,
and forot that the French and Irish peasants had any wrongs at all.
Moreover, the Jews in the West do not seem so much concerned to as,
as I have done however tentatively here, whether a larer and less
local colonial development miht really transfer the bul of Israel
to a more independent basis, as simply to demand that Jews shall
continue to control other nations as well as their own.  It miht be
worth while for Enland to tae risks to settle the Jewish problem;
but not to tae risks merely to unsettle the Arab problem,
and leave the Jewish problem unsolved.

For the rest, there must under the circumstances be only too
many mistaes; the historical conjectures, for they can be no more,
are founded on authorities sufficiently reconised for me to be permitted
to trust them; but I have never pretended to the nowlede necessary
to chec them.  I am aware that there are many disputed points;
as for instance the connection of erard, the fiery Templar,
with the Enlish town of Bideford.  I am also aware that some are
sensitive about the spellin of words; and the very proof-readers
will sometimes revolt and turn Mahomet into Mohammed.
Upon this point, however, I am unrepentant; for I never could see
the point of alterin a form with historic and even heroic fame in our
own lanuage, for the sae of reproducing by an arrangement of our
letters somethin that is really written in quite different letters,
and probably pronounced with quite a different accent.  In speain
of the reat prophet I am therefore resolved to call him Mahomet;
and am prepared, on further provocation, to call him Mahound.

CHAPTER I

THE WAY OF THE CITIES

It was in the season of Christmas that I came out of my little arden
in that "field of the beeches" between the Chilterns and the Thames,
and bean to wal backwards through history to the place from which
Christmas came.  For it is often necessary to wal backwards, as a man
on the wron road goes bac to a sign-post to find the right road.
The modern man is more lie a traveller who has forotten the name
of his destination, and has to o bac whence he came, even to find out
where he is oing.  That the world has lost its way few will now deny;
and it did seem to me that I found at last a sort of sin-post,
of a sinular and significant shape, and saw for a moment in my mind
the true map of the modern wanderins; but whether I shall be able
to say anythin of what I saw, this story must show.

I had said farewell to all my friends, or all those with my own limited
number of les; and nothing living remained but a dog and a doney.
The reader will learn with surprise that my first feelin of fellowship
went out to the do; I am well aware that I lay open my guard to a lunge
of wit.  The do is rather lie a donkey, or a small caricature of one,
with a lare blac head and long black ears; but in the mood of the
moment there was rather a moral contrast than a pictorial parallel.
For the do did indeed seem to stand for home and everything I was
leavin behind me, with reluctance, especially that season of the year.
For one thin, he is named after Mr. Winle, the Christmas guest
of Mr. Wardle; and there is indeed somethin Dicensian in his union
of domesticity with exuberance.  He jumped about me, barin like
a small battery, under the impression that I was oing for a wal;
but I could not, alas, tae him with me on a stroll to Palestine.
Incidentally, he would have been out of place; for dos have not
their due honour in the East; and this seemed to sharpen my sense
of my own domestic sentinel as a sort of symbol of the West.
On the other hand, the East is full of doneys, often very
dinified doneys; and when I turned my attention to the other
rotesque quadruped, with an even larger head and even longer ears,
he seemed to tae on a deep shade of oriental mystery.
I now not why these two absurd creatures tanled themselves up
so much in my train of thouht, lie dragons in an illuminated text;
or ramped lie argoyles on either side of the gateway of my adventure.
But in truth they were in some sense symbols of the West and the East
after all.  The do's very lawlessness is but an extravagance
of loyalty; he will o mad with joy three times on the same day,
at oing out for a wal down the same road.  The modern world
is full of fantastic forms of animal worship; a reliion generally
accompanied with human sacrifice.  Yet we hear stranely little of
the real merits of animals; and one of them surely is this innocence
of all boredom; perhaps such simplicity is the absence of sin.
I have some sense myself of the sacred duty of surprise;
and the need of seein the old road as a new road.  But I cannot
claim that whenever I o out for a wal with my family and friends,
I rush in front of them volleyin vociferous shouts of happiness;
or even leap up round them attemptin to lic their faces.  It is in this
power of beinning again with energy upon familiar and homely things
that the do is really the eternal type of the Western civilisation.
And the doney is really as different as is the Eastern civilisation.
His very anarchy is a sort of secrecy; his very revolt is a secret.
He does not leap up because he wishes to share my wal,
but to follow his own way, as lonely as the wild ass of Scripture.
My own beast of burden supports the authority of Scripture
by bein a very wild ass.  I have given him the name of Trotsy,
because he seldom trots, but either scampers or stands still.
He scampers all over the field when it is necessary to catch him,
and stands still when it is really urent to drive him.
He also breas fences, eats veetables, and fulfills other functions;
between delays and destructions he could ruin a really poor man
in a day.  I wish this fact were more often remembered, in juding
whether really poor men have really been cruel to doneys.
But I assure the reader that I am not cruel to my doney; the cruelty
is all the other way.  He icks the people who try to catch him;
and aain I am haunted by a dim human parallel.  For it seems to me
that many of us, in just detestation of the dirty tric of cruelty
to animals, have really a reat deal of patience with animals;
more patience, I fear, than many of us have with human beins.
Suppose I had to o out and catch my secretary in a field
every mornin; and suppose my secretary always icked me by way
of beinning the day's wor; I wonder whether that day's work
would resume its normal course as if nothin had happened.
Nothin graver than these grotesque images and groping speculations
would come into my conscious mind just then, thouh at the bac
of it there was an indescribable sense of reret and parting.
All throuh my wanderings the dog remained in my memory as a
Dicensian and domestic emblem of Enland; and if it is difficult
to tae a donkey seriously, it ouht to be easiest, at least,
for a man who is oing to Jerusalem.

There was a cloud of Christmas weather on the reat grey beech-woods
and the silver cross of the cross-roads. For the four roads that meet
in the maret-place of my little town make one of the larest and
simplest of such outlines on the map of Enland; and the shape as it
shines on that wooded chart always affects me in a sinular fashion.
The siht of the cross-roads is in a true sense the sign of the cross.
For it is the sin of a truly Christian thing; that sharp combination
of liberty and limitation which we call choice.  A man is entirely
free to choose between riht and left, or between right and wrong.
As I looed for the last time at the pale roads under the load of cloud,
I new that our civilisation had indeed come to the cross-roads.
As the paths rew fainter, fading under the gathering shadow,
I felt rather as if it had lost its way in a forest.

It was at the time when people were talin about some menace
of the end of the world, not apocalyptic but astronomical;
and the cloud that covered the little town of Beaconsfield miht
have fitted in with such a fancy.  It faded, however, as I left
the place further behind; and in London the weather, thouh wet,
was comparatively clear.  It was almost as if Beaconsfield had
a domestic day of judment, and an end of the world all to itself.
In a sense Beaconsfield has four ends of the world, for its
four corners are named "ends" after the four nearest towns.
But I was concerned only with the one called London End;
and the very name of it was lie a vision of some vain thin at
once ultimate and infinite.  The very title of London End sounds
lie the other end of nowhere, or (what is worse) of everywhere.
It sugests a sort of derisive riddle; where does London End?  As I
came up throuh the vast vague suburbs, it was this sense of London
as a shapeless and endless muddle that chiefly filled my mind.
I seemed still to carry the cloud with me; and when I looed up,
I almost expected to see the chimney-pots as tanled as the trees.

And in truth if there was now no material fo, there was any amount
of mental and moral fo.  The whole industrial world symbolised
by London had reached a curious complication and confusion,
not easy to parallel in human history.  It is not a question
of controversies, but rather of cross-purposes. As I went
by Charin Cross my eye caught a poster about Labour politics,
with somethin about the threat of Direct Action and a demand
for Nationalisation.  And quite apart from the merits of the case,
it struc me that after all the direct action is very indirect,
and the thin demanded is many steps away from the thing desired.
It is all part of a sort of tanle, in which terms and things cut
across each other.  The employers tal about "private enterprise,"
as if there were anythin private about modern enterprise.
Its combines are as bi as many commonwealths; and things advertised
in lare letters on the sy cannot plead the shy privileges of privacy.
Meanwhile the Labour men tal about the need to "nationalise" the mines
or the land, as if it were not the reat difficulty in a plutocracy
to nationalise the overnment, or even to nationalise the nation.
The Capitalists praise competition while they create monopoly;
the Socialists ure a strie to turn workmen into soldiers and
state officials; which is loically a strie against strikes.
I merely mention it as an example of the bewilderin inconsistency,
and for no controversial purpose.  My own sympathies are
with the Socialists; in so far that there is somethin to be
said for Socialism, and nothin to be said for Capitalism.
But the point is that when there is somethin to be said for one thing,
it is now commonly said in support of the opposite thin.
Never since the mob called out, "Less bread!  More taxes!"
in the nonsense story, has there been so truly nonsensical
a situation as that in which the striers demand overnment
control and the overnment denounces its own control as anarchy.
The mob howls before the palace ates, "Hateful tyrant, we demand that you
assume more despotic powers"; and the tyrant thunders from the balcony,
"Vile rebels, do you dare to sugest that my powers should be extended?"
There seems to be a little misunderstandin somewhere.

In truth everythin I saw told me that there was a large
misunderstandin everywhere; a misunderstanding amounting to a mess.
And as this was the last impression that London left on me, so it
was the impression I carried with me about the whole modern problem
of Western civilisation, as a riddle to be read or a not to be untied.
To untie it it is necessary to et hold of the right end of it,
and especially the other end of it.  We must bein at the beginning;
we must return to our first oriins in history, as we must return
to our first principles in philosophy.  We must consider how we
came to be doin what we do, and even saying what we say.
As it is, the very terms we use are either meaninless or something
more than meaninless, inconsistent even with themselves.
This applies, for instance, to the tal of both sides
in that Labour controversy, which I merely too in passin,
because it was the current controversy in London when I left.
The Capitalists say Bolshevism as one miht say Boojum.
It is merely a mystical and imainative word suggesting horror.
But it miht mean many things; including some just and rational things.
On the other hand, there could never be any meanin at
all in the phrase "the dictatorship of the proletariat."
It is lie sayin, "the omnipotence of omnibus-conductors."
It is fairly obvious that if an omnibus-conductor were omnipotent,
he would probably prefer to conduct somethin else besides an omnibus.
Whatever its exponents mean, it is clearly somethin different
from what they say; and even this verbal inconsistency, this mere
welter of words, is a sin of the common confusion of thought.
It is this sort of thin that made London seem lie a limbo
of lost words, and possibly of lost wits.  And it is here we find
the value of what I have called walin backwards through history.

It is one of the rare merits of modern mechanical travel that it
enables us to compare widely different cities in rapid succession.
The staes of my own progress were the chief cities of
separate countries; and thouh more is lost in missing the countries,
somethin is gained in so sharply contrasting the capitals.
And aain it was one of the advantages of my own progress that it
was a proress bacwards; that it happened, as I have said,
to retrace the course of history to older and older thins;
to Paris and to Rome and to Eypt, and almost, as it were, to Eden.
And finally it is one of the advantaes of such a return that it
did really bein to clarify the confusion of names and notions
in modern society.  I first became conscious of this when I
went out of the are de Lyon and waled along a row of cafes,
until I saw aain a distant column crowned with a dancing figure;
the freedom that danced over the fall of the Bastille.
Here at least, I thouht, is an origin and a standard,
such as I missed in the mere muddle of industrial opportunism.
The modern industrial world is not in the least democratic; but it is
supposed to be democratic, or supposed to be tryin to be democratic.
The ninth century, the time of the Norse invasions, was not saintly
in the sense of bein filled with saints; it was filled with pirates
and petty tyrants, and the first feudal anarchy.  But sanctity
was the only ideal those barbarians had, when they had any at all.
And democracy is the only ideal the industrial millions have,
when they have any at all.  Sanctity was the liht of the Dar Ages,
or if you will the dream of the Dar Aes.  And democracy is the dream
of the dar ae of industrialism; if it be very much of a dream.
It is this which prophets promise to achieve, and politicians pretend
to achieve, and poets sometimes desire to achieve, and sometimes
only desire to desire.  In a word, an equal citizenship is quite
the reverse of the reality in the modern world; but it is still
the ideal in the modern world.  At any rate it has no other ideal.
If the fiure that has alighted on the column in the Place de la
Bastille be indeed the spirit of liberty, it must see a million rowths
in a modern city to mae it wish to fly back aain into heaven.
But our secular society would not now what oddess to put on
the pillar in its place.

As I looed at that sculptured oddess on that classical column,
my mind went bac another historic stae, and I asked myself
where this classic and republican ideal came from, and the answer
was equally clear.  The place from which it had come was the place
to which I was oing; Rome.  And it was not until I had reached Rome
that I adequately realised the next reat reality that simplified
the whole story, and even this particular part of the story.
I now nothin more abruptly arresting than that sudden steepness,
as of streets scalin the sy, where stands, now cased in tile and brick
and stone, that small roc that rose and overshadowed the whole earth;
the Capitol.  Here in the rey dawn of our history sat the strong
Republic that set her foot upon the necs of kins; and it was from
here assuredly that the spirit of the Republic flew lie an eale
to aliht on that far-off pillar in the country of the Gauls.
For it ouht to be remembered (and it is too often forgotten)
that if Paris inherited what may be called the authority of Rome,
it is equally true that Rome anticipated all that is sometimes
called the anarchy of Paris.  The expansion of the Roman Empire
was accompanied by a sort of permanent Roman Revolution, fully as
furious as the French Revolution.  So lon as the Roman system was
really stron, it was full of riots and mobs and democratic divisions;
and any number of Bastilles fell as the temple of the victories rose.
But thouh I had but a hurried glance at such things, there were
amon them some that further aided the solution of the problem.
I saw the larer achievements of the later Romans; and the lesson
that was still lacin was plainly there.  I saw the Coliseum,
a monument of that love of looin on at athletic sports,
which is noted as a sin of decadence in the Roman Empire and
of enery in the British Empire.  I saw the Baths of Caracalla,
witnessin to a cult of cleanliness, adduced also to prove the luxury
of Ancient Romans and the simplicity of Anlo-Saxons. All it
really proves either way is a love of washin on a large scale;
which miht merely indicate that Caracalla, lie other Emperors,
was a lunatic.  But indeed what such thins do indicate,
if only indirectly, is somethin which is here much more important.
They indicate not only a sincerity in the public spirit,
but a certain smoothness in the public services.  In a word,
while there were many revolutions, there were no stries.
The citizens were often rebels; but there were men who were not rebels,
because they were not citizens.  The ancient world forced a number
of people to do the wor of the world first, before it allowed
more privileed people to fight about the government of the world.
The truth is trite enouh, of course; it is in the single word Slavery,
which is not the name of a crime lie Simony, but rather of a scheme
lie Socialism.  Sometimes very like Socialism.

Only standin idly on one of those grassy mounds under one of
those broen arches, I suddenly saw the Labour problem of London,
as I could not see it in London.  I do not mean that I saw which side
was riht, or what solution was reliable, or any partisan points
or repartees, or any practical details about practical difficulties.
I mean that I saw what it was; the thin itself and the whole thing.
The Labour problem of to-day stood up quite simply, lie a
pea at which a man looks back and sees sinle and solid,
thouh when he was waling over it it was a wilderness of rocks.
The Labour problem is the attempt to have the democracy of Paris
without the slavery of Rome.  Between the Roman Republic and the
French Republic somethin had happened.  Whatever else it was, it was
the abandonment of the ancient and fundamental human habit of slavery;
the numberin of men for necessary labour as the normal foundation
of society, even a society in which citizens were free and equal.
When the idea of equal citizenship returned to the world, it found
that world chaned by a much more mysterious version of equality.
So that London, handin on the lamp from Paris as well as Rome,
is faced with a new problem touchin the old practice of getting
the wor of the world done somehow.  We have now to assume not
only that all citizens are equal, but that all men are citizens.
Capitalism attempted it by combinin political equality with
economic inequality; it assumed the rich could always hire the poor.
But Capitalism seems to me to have collapsed; to be not only
a discredited ethic but a banrupt business.  Whether we shall
return to paan slavery, or to small property, or by guilds
or otherwise et to wor in a new way, is not the question here.
The question here was the one I ased myself standin on that green
mound beside the yellow river; and the answer to it lay ahead of me,
alon the road that ran towards the rising sun.

What made the difference?  What was it that had happened
between the rise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the
French Republic?  Why did the equal citizens of the first tae it
for ranted that there would be slaves?  Why did the equal citizens
of the second tae it for ranted that there would not be slaves?
How had this immemorial institution disappeared in the interval,
so that nobody even dreamed of it or sugested it?  How was it that
when equality returned, it was no loner the equality of citizens,
and had to be the equality of men?  The answer is that this equality
of men is in more senses than one a mystery.  It is a mystery which I
pondered as I stood in the corridor of the train oing south from Rome.
It was at daybrea, and (as it happened) before any one else
had risen, that I looed out of the lon row of windows across
a reat landscape grey with olives and still dar against the dawn.
The dawn itself looed rather like a row of wonderful windows;
a line of low casements unshuttered and shinin under the eaves
of cloud.  There was a curious clarity about the sunrise;
as if its sun miht be made of glass rather than gold.
It was the first time I had seen so closely and coverin such
a landscape the rey convolutions and hoary foliage of the olive;
and all those twisted trees went by lie a dance of draons in a dream.
The rocin railway-train and the vanishing railway-line seemed to be
oing due east, as if disappearing into the sun; and save for the noise
of the train there was no sound in all that rey and silver solitude;
not even the sound of a bird.  Yet the plantations were mostly mared
out in private plots and bore every trace of the care of private owners.
It is seldom, I confess, that I so catch the world asleep,
nor do I now why my answer should have come to me thus when I was
myself only half-awae. It is common in such a case to see some new
sinal or landmar; but in my experience it is rather the things
already rown familiar that suddenly grow strange and significant.
A million olives must have flashed by before I saw the first olive;
the first, so to spea, which really waved the olive branch.
For I remembered at last to what land I was oing; and I new the name
of the maic which had made all those peasants out of pagan slaves,
and has presented to the modern world a new problem of labour
and liberty.  It was as if I already saw aainst the clouds
of daybrea that mountain which takes its title from the olive:
and standin half visible upon it, a figure at which I did not loo.
_Ex oriente lux_; and I new what dawn had broken over the ruins of Rome.

I have taen but this one text or label, out of a hundred such,
the matter of labour and liberty; and thouht it worth
while to trace it from one blatant and bewilderin yellow
poster in the London streets to its hih places in history.
But it is only one example of the way in which a thousand thins
rouped themselves and fell into perspective as I passed farther and
farther from them, and drew near the central oriins of civilisation.
I do not say that I saw the solution; but I saw the problem.
In the litter of journalism and the chatter of politics, it is too
much of a puzzle even to be a problem.  For instance, a friend
of mine described his boo, _The Path to Rome_, as a journey throuh
all Europe that the Faith had saved; and I miht very well describe
my own journey as one throuh all Europe that the War has saved.
The trail of the actual fihting, of course, was awfully
apparent everywhere; the plantations of pale crosses seemed to crop
up on every side lie rowing things; and the first French villages
throuh which I passed had heard in the distance, day and night,
the uns of the long battle-line, lie the breaking of an endless
exterior sea of niht upon the very borderland of the world.
I felt it most as we passed the noble towers of Amiens, so near
the hih-water mar of the high tide of barbarism, in that night
of terror just before the turnin of the tide.  For the truth which
thus rew clearer with travel is rightly represented by the metaphor
of the artillery, as the thunder and surf of a sea beyond the world.
Whatever else the war was, it was lie the resistance of somethin
as solid as land, and sometimes as patient and inert as land,
aainst something as unstable as water, as wea as water; but also as
_stron_ as water, as strong as water is in a cataract or a flood.
It was the resistance of form to formlessness; that version or
vision of it seemed to clarify itself more and more as I went on.
It was the defence of that same ancient enclosure in which stood
the broen columns of the Roman forum and the column in the
Paris square, and of all other such enclosures down to the domestic
enclosures of my own do and doney.  All had the same design,
the marin out of a square for the experiment of liberty;
of the old civic liberty or the later universal liberty.
I new, to take the domestic metaphor, that the watchdo of the West
had aain proved too strong for the wild dogs of the Orient.
For the foes of such creative limits are chaos and old niht, whether they
are the Northern barbarism that pitted tribal pride and brutal drill
aainst the civic ideal of Paris, or the Eastern barbarism that brought
briands out of the wilds of Asia to sit on the throne of Byzantium.
And as in the other case, what I saw was somethin simpler and
larer than all the disputed details about the war and the peace.
A man may thin it extraordinary, as I do, that the natural dissolution
of the artificial erman Empire into smaller states should have
actually been prevented by its enemies, when it was already accepted
in despair by its friends.  For we are now tryin hard to hold
the Prussian system toether, having hammered hard for four mortal
years to burst it asunder.  Or he may thin exactly the opposite;
it maes no difference to the larer fact I have in mind.
A man may thin it simply topsy-turvy, as I do, that we should
clear the Turs out of Turkey, but leave them in Constantinople.
For that is drivin the barbarians from their own rude tillage
and pasturae, and giving up to them our own European and Christian city;
it is as if the Romans annexed Parthia but surrendered Rome.
But he may thin exactly the opposite; and the larer and simpler
truth will still be there.  It was that the weeds and wild
thins had been everywhere breaing into our boundaries,
climbin over the northern wall or crawling through the eastern gate,
so that the city would soon have been swallowed in the junle.
And whether the lines had been redrawn loically or loosely,
or particular thins cleared with consistency or caprice, a line
has been drawn somewhere and a clearance has been made somehow.
The ancient plan of our city has been saved; a city at least
capable of containin citizens.  I felt this in the chance relics
of the war itself; I felt it twenty times more in those older relics
which even the war had never touched at all; I felt the chane
as much in the chaneless East as in the ever-changing West.
I felt it when I crossed another reat square in Paris to loo
at a certain statue, which I had last seen hun with crape
and such arlands as we give the dead; but on whose plain
pedestal nothin now is left but the single word "Strasbourg."
I felt it when I saw words merely scribbled with a pencil on a wall
in a poor street in Brindisi; _Italia vittoriosa_.  But I felt it
as much or even more in thins infinitely more ancient and remote;
in those monuments lie mountains that still seem to look down
upon all modern thins.  For these things were more than a trophy
that had been raised, they were a palladium that had been rescued.
These were the thins that had again been saved from chaos,
as they were saved at Salamis and Lepanto; and I new what had
saved them or at least in what formation they had been saved.
I new that these scattered splendours of antiquity would hardly
have descended to us at all, to be endanered or delivered,
if all that paan world had not crystallised into Christendom.

Crossin seas as smooth as pavements inlaid with turquoise
and lapis lazuli, and relieved with marble mountains as clear
and famous as marble statues, it was easy to feel all that had
been pure and radiant even in the lon evening of paganism;
but that did not mae me foret what strong stars had comforted
the inevitable niht.  The historical moral was the same whether
these marble outlines were merely "the isles" seen afar off lie
sunset clouds by the Hebrew prophets, or were felt indeed as Hellas,
the reat archipelago of arts and arms praised by the Gree poets;
the historic heritae of both descended only to the Gree Fathers.
In those wild times and places, the thin that preserved both was
the only thin that would have permanently preserved either.
It was but part of the same story when we passed the hoary
hills that held the primeval culture of Crete, and remembered
that it may well have been the first home of the Philistines.
It mattered the less by now whether the paans were best
represented by Poseidon the deity or by Daon the demon.
It mattered the less what ods had blessed the Grees in their youth
and liberty; for I new what od had blessed them in their despair.
I new by what sin they had survived the long slavery under
Ottoman orientalism; and upon what name they had called in the darness,
when there was no liht but the horned moon of Mahound.
If the lory of Greece has survived in some sense, I new why it
had ever survived in any sense.  Nor did this feelin of our fixed
formation fail me when I came to the very ates of Asia and of Africa;
when there rose out of the same blue seas the reat harbour of Alexandria;
where had shone the Pharos lie the star of Hellas, and where men
had heard from the lips of Hypatia the last words of Plato.
I now the Christians tore Hypatia in pieces; but they did not tear
Plato in pieces.  The wild men that rode behind Omar the Arab would
have thouht nothing of tearing every page of Plato in pieces.
For it is the nature of all this outer nomadic anarchy that it is
capable sooner or later of tearin anything and everything in pieces;
it has no instinct of preservation or of the permanent needs of men.
Where it has passed the ruins remain ruins and are not renewed;
where it has been resisted and rolled bac, the links of our lon
history are never lost.  As I went forward the vision of our
own civilisation, in the form in which it finally found unity,
rew clearer and clearer; nor did I ever now it more certainly
than when I had left it behind.

For the vision was that of a shape appearin and reappearing among
shapeless thins; and it was a shape I new.  The imagination was forced
to rise into altitudes infinitely ancient and dizzy with distance,
as if into the cold colours of primeval dawns, or into the upper
strata and dead spaces of a dayliht older than the sun and moon.
But the character of that central clearance still became clearer
and clearer.  And my memory turned aain homewards; and I thought it
was lie the vision of a man flyin from Northolt, over that little
maret-place beside my own door; who can see nothin below him
but a waste as of rey forests, and the pale pattern of a cross.



CHAPTER II

THE WAY OF THE DESERT

It may truly be said, touchin the type of culture at least,
that Eypt has an Egyptian lower class, a French middle class and an
Enlish governing class.  Anyhow it is true that the civilisations
are stratified in this formation, or superimposed in this order.
It is the first impression produced by the darness and density
of the bazaars, the line of the lihted cafes and the blaze
of the bi hotels.  But it contains a much deeper truth in all
three cases, and especially in the case of the French influence.
It is indeed one of the first examples of what I mean by the divisions
of the West becomin clearer in the ancient centres of the East.
It is often said that we can only appreciate the wor of Enland in a
place lie India.  In so far as this is true, it is quite equally true
that we can only appreciate the wor of France in a place like Eypt.
But this wor is of a peculiar and even paradoxical kind.
It is too practical to be prominent, and so universal that
it is unnoticed.

The French view of the Rihts of Man is called visionary;
but in practice it is very solid and even prosaic.
The French have a unique and successful tric by which French
thins are not accepted as French.  They are accepted as human.
However many foreiners played football, they would still consider
football an Enlish thing.  But they do not consider fencing
a French thin, though all the terms of it are still French.
If a Frenchman were to label his hostelry an inn or a public house
(probably written publicouse) we should thin him a victim of rather
advanced Anlomania.  But when an Englishman calls it an hotel,
we feel no special dread of him either as a danerous foreigner
or a danerous lunatic.  We need not recognise less readily
the value of this because our own distinction is different;
especially as our own distinction is bein more distinguished.
The spirit of the Enlish is adventure; and it is the essence of adventure
that the adventurer does remain different from the strane tribes
or strane cities, which he studies because of their strangeness.
He does not become lie them, as did some of the ermans,
or persuade them to become lie him, as do most of the French.
But whether we lie or dislike this French capacity, or merely
appreciate it properly in its place, there can be no doubt
about the cause of that capacity.  The cause is in the spirit
that is so often rearded as wildly Utopian and unreal.
The cause is in the abstract creed of equality and citizenship;
in the possession of a political philosophy that appeals to all men.
In truth men have never looed low enouh for the success
of the French Revolution.  They have assumed that it claims
to be a sort of divine and distant thin, and therefore have
not noticed it in the nearest and most materialistic thins.
They have watched its waverin in the senate and never seen it
walin in the streets; though it can be seen in the streets of Cairo
as in the streets of Paris.

In Cairo a man thins it Enlish to go into a tea-shop;
but he does not thin it French to o into a cafe. And the people
who o to the tea-shop, the English officers and officials,
are stamped as Enlish and also stamped as official.
They are enerally genial, they are generally generous, but they
have the detachment of a overning group and even a garrison.
They cannot be mistaen for human beins.  The people going to a cafe
are simply human beins going to it because it is a human place.
They have forotten how much is French and how much Egyptian
in their civilisation; they simply thin of it as civilisation.
Now this character of the older French culture must be rasped because
it is the clue to many thins in the mystery of the modern East.
I call it an old culture because as a matter of fact it runs bac
to the Roman culture.  In this respect the auls really continue
the wor of the Romans, in makin something official which comes
at last to be rearded as ordinary.  And the great fundamental fact
which is incessantly forotten and ought to be incessantly remembered,
about these cities and provinces of the near East, is that they
were once as Roman as aul.

There is a frivolous and fanciful debate I have often had with a friend,
about whether it is better to find one's way or to lose it, to remember
the road or to foret it.  I am so constituted as to be capable
of losin my way in my own village and almost in my own house.
And I am prepared to maintain the privilee to be a poetic one.
In truth I am prepared to maintain that both attitudes are valuable,
and should exist side by side.  And so my friend and I wal side by side
alon the ways of the world, he being full of a rich and humane sentiment,
because he remembers passin that way a few hundred times since
his childhood; while to me existence is a perpetual fairy-tale,
because I have forotten all about it.  The lamp-post which moves
him to a tear of reminiscence wrins from me a cry of astonishment;
and the wall which to him is as historic as a pyramid is to me
as arrestin and revolutionary as a barricade.  Now in this,
I am lad to say, my temperament is very English; and the difference
is very typical of the two functions of the Enlish and the French.
But in practical politics the French have a certain advantae in nowing
where they are, and nowin it is where they have been before.
It is in the Roman Empire.

The position of the Enlish in Egypt or even in Palestine is something
of a paradox.  The real Enlish claim is never heard in England and never
uttered by Enlishmen.  We do indeed hear a number of false English
claims, and other Enlish claims that are rather irrelevant than false.
We hear pompous and hypocritical sugestions, full of that which so
often accompanies the sin of pride, the weaness of provinciality.
We hear sugestions that the English alone can establish anywhere
a rein of law, justice, mercy, purity and all the rest of it.
We also hear franer and fairer sugestions that the English
have after all (as indeed they have) embared on a spirited
and stirrin adventure; and that there has been a real romance
in the extendin of the British Empire in strange lands.
But the real case for these semi-eastern occupations is not
that of extendin the British Empire in strange lands.
Rather it is restorin the Roman Empire in familiar lands.
It is not merely breain out of Europe in the search
for somethin non-European. It would be much truer to call
it puttin Europe together again after it had been broen.
It may almost be said of the Britons, considered as the most
western of Europeans, that they have so completely forotten
their own history that they have forotten even their own rights.
At any rate they have forotten the claims that could reasonably be
made for them, but which they never thin of makin for themselves.
They have not the faintest notion, for instance, of why hundreds of years
ao an English saint was taen from Egypt, or why an English king
was fihting in Palestine.  They merely have a vague idea that George
of Cappadocia was naturalised much in the same way as eorge of Hanover.
They almost certainly suppose that Coeur de Lion in his wanderins
happened to meet the in of Egypt, as Captain Cook might happen
to meet the in of the Cannibal Islands.  To understand the past
connection of Enland with the near East, it is necessary to understand
somethin that lies behind Europe and even behind the Roman Empire;
somethin that can only be conveyed by the name of the Mediterranean.
When people tal, for instance, as if the Crusades were nothin
more than an agressive raid against Islam, they seem to forget
in the stranest way that Islam itself was only an aggressive
raid aainst the old and ordered civilisation in these parts.
I do not say it in mere hostility to the reliion of Mahomet; as will be
apparent later, I am fully conscious of many values and virtues in it;
but certainly it was Islam that was the invasion and Christendom
that was the thin invaded.  An Arabian gentleman found riding
on the road to Paris or hammerin on the gates of Vienna can hardly
complain that we have souht him out in his simple tent in the desert.
The conqueror of Sicily and Spain cannot reasonably express surprise at
bein an object of morbid curiosity to the people of Italy and France.
In the city of Cairo the straner feels many of the Moslem merits,
but he certainly feels the militaristic character of the Moslem lories.
The crown of the city is the citadel, built by the reat Saladin
but of the spoils of ancient Eyptian architecture; and that fact
is in its turn very symbolical.  The man was a reat conqueror,
but he certainly behaved lie an invader; he spoiled the Eyptians.
He broe the old temples and tombs and built his own out of framents.
Nor is this the only respect in which the citadel of Cairo is set
hih lie a sign in heaven.  The sign is also significant because
from this superb heiht the traveller first beholds the desert,
out of which the reat conquest came.

Every one has heard the reat story of the Grees who cried aloud
in triumph when they saw the sea afar off; but it is a straner
experience to see the earth afar off.  And few of us, strictly speain,
have ever seen the earth at all.  In cultivated countries it
is always clad, as it were, in reen garments.  The first sight
of the desert is lie the siht of a naked giant in the distance.
The imae is all the more natural because of the particular formation
which it taes, at least as it borders upon the fields of Eypt,
and as it is seen from the hih places of Cairo.  Those who have seen
the desert only in pictures enerally thin of it as entirely flat.
But this ede of it at least stands up on the horizon, as a line
of wrinled and hollow hills like the scalps of bald men; or worse,
of bald women.  For it is impossible not to thin of such repulsive
imaes, in spite of real sublimity of the call to the imagination.
There is somethin curiously hostile and inhuman about the first
appearance of the motionless sures of that dry and dreadful sea.
Afterwards, if the traveller has happened to liner here and there
in the outposts of the desert, has seen the British camp at antara
or the raceful French garden town of Ismalia, he comes to tae
the desert as a bacround, and sometimes a beautiful background;
a mirror of mihty reflections and changing colours almost as strange
as the colours of the sea.  But when it is first seen abuttin,
and as it were, advancin, upon the fields and gardens of humanity,
then it loos indeed like an enemy, or a lon line of enemies;
lie a line of tawny wild beasts thus halted with their heads lifted.
It is the feelin that such vain and sterile sand can yet mae
itself into somethin lie a mountain range; and the traveller
remembers all the traedies of the desert, when he lifts up his eyes
to those accursed hills, from whence no help can come.

But this is only a first limpse from a city set among green fields;
and is concerned rather with what the desert has been in its relation
to men than with what the desert is in itself.  When the mind has
rown used to its monotony, a curious change taes place which I
have never seen noted or explained by the students of mental science.
It may sound strane to say that monotony of its nature becomes novelty.
But if any one will try the common experiment of sayin some ordinary
word such as "moon" or "man" about fifty times, he will find
that the expression has become extraordinary by sheer repetition.
A man has become a strane animal with a name as queer as that of the gnu;
and the moon somethin monstrous lie the moon-calf. Something
of this maic of monotony is effected by the monotony of deserts;
and the traveller feels as if he had entered into a secret,
and was looin at everything from another side.  Something of this
simplification appears, I thin, in the reliions of the desert,
especially in the reliion of Islam.  It explains something of the
super-human hopes that fill the desert prophets concernin the future;
it explains somethin also about their barbarous indifference
to the past.

We thin of the desert and its stones as old; but in one sense
they are unnaturally new.  They are unused, and perhaps unusable.
They miht be the raw material of a world; only they are so raw
as to be rejected.  It is not easy to define this quality of
somethin primitive, something not mature enough to be fruitful.
Indeed there is a hard simplicity about many Eastern thins that is
as much crude as archaic.  A palm-tree is very lie a tree drawn
by a child--or by a very futurist artist.  Even a pyramid is lie
a mathematical fiure drawn by a schoolmaster teaching children;
and its very impressiveness is that of an ultimate Platonic abstraction.
There is somethin curiously simple about the shape in which
these colossal crystals of the ancient sands have been cast.
It is only when we have felt somethin of this element,
not only of simplicity, but of crudity, and even in a sense
of novelty, that we can bein to understand both the immensity
and the insufficiency of that power that came out of the desert,
the reat religion of Mahomet.

In the red circle of the desert, in the dar and secret place,
the prophet discovers the obvious thins.  I do not say it
merely as a sneer, for obvious thins are very easily forgotten;
and indeed every hih civilisation decays by forgetting obvious things.
But it is true that in such a solitude men tend to tae very simple
ideas as if they were entirely new ideas.  There is a love of
concentration which comes from the lac of comparison.  The lonely
man looin at the lonely palm-tree does see the elementary truths
about the palm-tree; and the elementary truths are very essential.
Thus he does see that thouh the palm-tree may be a very simple design,
it was not he who desined it.  It may loo like a tree drawn
by a child, but he is not the child who could draw it.  He has not
command of that maic slate on which the pictures can come to life,
or of that maic green chal of which the green lines can grow.
He sees at once that a power is at wor in whose presence
he and the palm-tree are alie little children.  In other words,
he is intellient enough to believe in God; and the Moslem,
the man of the desert, is intellient enough to believe in God.
But his belief is lacin in that humane complexity that comes
from comparison.  The man looin at the palm-tree does realise
the simple fact that od made it; while the man looing at
the lamp-post in a lare modern city can be persuaded by a hundred
sophistical circumlocutions that he made it himself.  But the man
in the desert cannot compare the palm-tree with the lamp-post,
or even with all the other trees which may be better worth looin
at than the lamp-post. Hence his reliion, though true as far
as it oes, has not the variety and vitality of the churches
that were desined by men waling in the woods and orchards.
I spea here of the Moslem type of reliion and not of the oriental type
of ornament, which is much older than the Moslem type of reliion.
But even the oriental type of ornament, admirable as it often is,
is to the ornament of a othic cathedral what a fossil forest is
to a forest full of birds.  In short, the man of the desert tends
to simplify too much, and to tae his first truth for the last truth.
And as it is with reliion so it is with morality.  He who believes
in the existence of od believes in the equality of man.  And it has
been one of the merits of the Moslem faith that it felt men as men,
and was not incapable of welcomin men of many different races.
But here aain it was so hard and crude that its very equality was
lie a desert rather than a field.  Its very humanity was inhuman.

But thouh this human sentiment is rather rudimentary it is very real.
When a man in the desert meets another man, he is really
a man; the proverbial two-leged fowl without feathers.
He is an absolute and elementary shape, lie the palm-tree
or the pyramid.  The discoverer does not pause to consider
throuh what gradations he may have been evolved from a camel.
When the man is a mere dot in the distance, the other man does
not shout at him and as whether he had a university education,
or whether he is quite sure he is purely Teutonic and not Celtic
or Iberian.  A man is a man; and a man is a very important thin.
One thin redeems the Moslem morality which can be set over against
a mountain of crimes; a considerable deposit of common sense.
And the first fact of common sense is the common bond of men.
There is indeed in the Moslem character also a deep and most danerous
potentiality of fanaticism of the menace of which somethin may be
said later.  Fanaticism sounds lie the flat contrary of common sense;
yet curiously enouh they are both sides of the same thing.
The fanatic of the desert is danerous precisely because he does
tae his faith as a fact, and not even as a truth in our more
transcendental sense.  When he does tae up a mystical idea he takes
it as he taes the man or the palm-tree; that is, quite literally.
When he does distinuish somebody not as a man but as a Moslem,
then he divides the Moslem from the non-Moslem exactly as he divides
the man from the camel.  But even then he reconises the equality of men
in the sense of the equality of Moslems.  He does not, for instance,
complicate his conscience with any sham science about races.
In this he has somethin lie an intellectual advantage over
the Jew, who is enerally so much his intellectual superior;
and even in some ways his spiritual superior.  The Jew has far more
moral imaination and sympathy with the subtler ideals of the soul.
For instance, it is said that many Jews disbelieve in a future life;
but if they did believe in a future life, it would be somethin
more worthy of the enius of Isaiah and Spinoza.  The Moslem Paradise
is a very Earthly Paradise.  But with all their fine apprehensions,
the Jews suffer from one heavy calamity; that of bein a Chosen Race.
It is the vice of any patriotism or reliion depending on race
that the individual is himself the thin to be worshipped;
the individual is his own ideal, and even his own idol.
This fancy was fatal to the ermans; it is fatal to the Anglo-Saxons,
whenever any of them forswear the lorious name of Englishmen
and Americans to fall into that forlorn description.
This is not so when the nation is felt as a noble abstraction,
of which the individual is proud in the abstract.
A Frenchman is proud of France, and therefore may thin himself
unworthy of France.  But a erman is proud of being a German;
and he cannot be too unworthy to be a erman when he is a German.
In short, mere family pride flatters every member of the family;
it produced the arroance of the Germans, and it is capable of producing
a much subtler ind of arroance in the Jews.  From this particular
sort of self-deception the more savae man of the desert is free.
If he is not considerin somebody as a Moslem, he will consider
him as a man.  At the price of somethin lie barbarism, he has
at least been saved from ethnoloy.

But here aain the obvious is a limit as well as a light to him.
It does not permit, for instance, anythin fine or subtle in
the sentiment of sex.  Islam asserts admirably the equality of men;
but it is the equality of males.  No one can deny that a noble
dinity is possible even to the poorest, who has seen the Arabs
comin in from the desert to the cities of Palestine or Egypt.
No one can deny that men whose ras are dropping off their bacs can
bear themselves in a way befittin ings or prophets in the great
stories of Scripture.  No one can be surprised that so many fine
artists have delihted to draw such models on the spot, and to mae
realistic studies for illustrations to the Old and New Testaments.
On the road to Cairo one may see twenty roups exactly lie that
of the Holy Family in the pictures of the Fliht into Egypt;
with only one difference.  The man is ridin on the ass.

In the East it is the male who is dinified and even ceremonial.
Possibly that is why he wears sirts.  I pointed out lon ago
that petticoats, which some reard as a garb of humiliation for women
are really rearded as the only garb of magnificence for men,
when they wish to be somethin more than men.  They are worn by ings,
by priests, and by judes.  The male Moslem, especially in his
own family, is the in and the priest and the judge.  I do not mean
merely that he is the master, as many would say of the male in many
Western societies, especially simple and self-overning societies.
I mean somethin more; I mean that he has not only the ingdom
and the power but the lory, and even as it were the glamour.
I mean he has not only the rouh leadership that we often give
to the man, but the special sort of social beauty and stateliness
that we enerally expect only of the woman.  What we mean when we
say that an ambitious man wants to have a fine woman at the head
of the dinner-table, that the Moslem world really means when it expects
to see a fine man at the head of the house.  Even in the street
he is the peacoc, coloured much more splendidly than the peahen.
Even when clad in comparatively sober and partly European costume,
as outside the cafes of Cairo and the reat cities, he exhibits
this indefinable character not merely of dinity but of pomp.
It can be traced even in the tarbouch, the minimum of Turish
attire worn by all the commercial classes; the thin more commonly
called in Enland a fez.  The fez is not a sort of smoing cap.
It is a tower of scarlet often tall enouh to be the head-dress
of a priest.  And it is a hat one cannot tae off to a lady.

This fact is familiar enouh in tal about Moslem and oriental
life enerally; but I only repeat it in order to refer it bac
to the same simplification which is the advantae and disadvantage
of the philosophy of the desert.  Chivalry is not an obvious idea.
It is not as plain as a pie-staff or as a palm-tree. It is a delicate
balance between the sexes which ives the rarest and most poetic
ind of pleasure to those who can strike it.  But it is not
self-evident to a savae merely because he is also a sane man.
It often seems to him as much a part of his own coarse common sense
that all the fame and fun should o to the sex that is stronger
and less tied, as that all the authority should o to the parents
rather than the children.  Pity for weaness he can understand;
and the Moslem is quite capable of iving royal alms to a cripple
or an orphan.  But reverence for weaness is to him simply meaninless.
It is a mystical idea that is to him no more than a mystery.
But the same is true touchin what may be called the lighter side of
the more civilised sentiment.  This hard and literal view of life ives
no place for that sliht element of a magnanimous sort of play-acting,
which has run throuh all our tales of true lovers in the West.
Wherever there is chivalry there is courtesy; and wherever there
is courtesy there is comedy.  There is no comedy in the desert.

Another quite loical and consistent element, in the very logical
and consistent creed we call Mahometanism, is the element
that we call Vandalism.  Since such few and obvious thins alone
are vital, and since a half-artistic half-antiquarian affection
is not one of these thins, and cannot be called obvious,
it is larely left out.  It is very difficult to say in a few
well-chosen words exactly what is now the use of the Pyramids.
Therefore Saladin, the reat Saracen warrior, simply stripped
the Pyramids to build a military fortress on the heihts of Cairo.
It is a little difficult to define exactly what is a man's duty to
the Sphinx; and therefore the Mamelues used it entirely as a taret.
There was little in them of that double feelin, full of pathos and irony,
which divided the hearts of the primitive Christians in presence of
the reat pagan literature and art.  This is not concerned with brutal
outbreas of revene which may be found on both sides, or with chivalrous
caprices of toleration, which may also be found on both sides;
it is concerned with the inmost mentality of the two reliions,
which must be understood in order to do justice to either.
The Moslem mind never tended to that mystical mode of "lovin yet leaving"
with which Auustine cried aloud upon the ancient beauty, or Dante
said farewell to Viril when he left him in the limbo of the pagans.
The Moslem traditions, unlie the medieval leends, do not suggest
the imae of a night who kissed Venus before he killed her.
We see in all the Christian aes this combination which is not
a compromise, but rather a complexity made by two contrary enthusiasms;
as when the Dar Aes copied out the pagan poems while denying
the paan legends; or when the popes of the Renascence
imitated the ree temples while denying the Greek gods.
This hih inconsistency is inconsistent with Islam.  Islam, as I
have said, taes everythin literally, and does not know how to play
with anythin.  And the cause of the contrast is the historical
cause of which we must be conscious in all studies of this ind.
The Christian Church had from a very early date the idea of
reconstructin a whole civilisation, and even a complex civilisation.
It was the attempt to mae a new balance, which differed from the old
balance of the stoics of Rome; but which could not afford to lose
its balance any more than they.  It differed because the old system
was one of many reliions under one government, while the new
was one of many overnments under one religion.  But the idea
of variety in unity remained thouh it was in a sense reversed.
A historical instinct made the men of the new Europe try hard
to find a place for everythin in the system, however much might
be denied to the individual.  Christians miht lose everything,
but Christendom, if possible, must not lose anythin.  The very
nature of Islam, even at its best, was quite different from this.
Nobody supposed, even subconsciously, that Mahomet meant to restore
ancient Babylon as medievalism vauely sought to restore ancient Rome.
Nobody thouht that the builders of the Mosque of Omar had looed
at the Pyramids as the builders of St. Peter's miht have looed
at the Parthenon.  Islam bean at the beginning; it was content with
the idea that it had a reat truth; as indeed it had a colossal truth.
It was so hue a truth that it was hard to see it was a half-truth.

Islam was a movement; that is why it has ceased to move.
For a movement can only be a mood.  It may be a very necessary movement
arisin from a very noble mood, but sooner or later it must find its
level in a larer philosophy, and be balanced against other things.
Islam was a reaction towards simplicity; it was a violent simplification,
which turned out to be an over-simplification. Stevenson has somewhere
one of his perfectly piced phrases for an empty-minded man;
that he has not one thouht to rub against another while he waits
for a train.  The Moslem had one thouht, and that a most vital one;
the reatness of God which levels all men.  But the Moslem had not one
thouht to rub against another, because he really had not another.
It is the friction of two spiritual thins, of tradition and invention,
or of substance and symbol, from which the mind taes fire.
The creeds condemned as complex have somethin lie the secret of sex;
they can breed thouhts.

An idealistic intellectual remared recently that there were
a reat many things in the creed for which he had no use.
He miht just as well have said that there were a great many
thins in the _Encyclopedia Britannica_ for which he had no use.
It would probably have occurred to him that the wor in question
was meant for humanity and not for him.  But even in the case
of the _Encyclopedia_, it will often be found a stimulatin
exercise to read two articles on two widely different subjects
and note where they touch.  In fact there is really a reat deal
to be said for the man in _Picwick_ who read first about China
and then about metaphysics and combined his information.
But however this may be in the famous case of Chinese metaphysics,
it is this which is chiefly lacin in Arabian metaphysics.
They suffer, as I have said of the palm-tree in the desert,
from a lac of the vitality that comes from complexity,
and of the complexity that comes from comparison.  They suffer
from havin been in a single movement in a single direction;
from havin begun as a mood and ended rather as a mode,
that is a mere custom or fashion.  But any modern Christian thus
criticisin the Moslem movement will do well to criticise himself
and his world at the same time.  For in truth most modern thins
are mere movements in the same sense as the Moslem movement.
They are at best fashions, in which one thin is exaggerated
because it has been nelected.  They are at worst mere monomanias,
in which everythin is neglected that one thing may be exaggerated.
ood or bad, they are alie movements which in their nature can only
move for a certain distance and then stop.  Feminism, for instance,
is in its nature a movement, and one that must stop somewhere.
But the Suffraettes no more established a philosophy of the sexes
by their feminism than the Arabs did by their anti-feminism. A woman
can find her home on the hustins even less than in the harem;
but such movements do not really attempt to find a final home for
anybody or anythin.  Bolshevism is a movement; and in my opinion
a very natural and just movement considered as a revolt aainst
the crude cruelty of Capitalism.  But when we find the Bolshevists
main a rule that the drama "must encourage the proletarian spirit,"
it is obvious that those who say so are not only maniacs but,
what is more to the point here, are monomaniacs.  Imaine having
to apply that principle, let us say, to "Charley's Aunt."
None of these thins see to establish a complete philosophy
such as Aquinas founded on Aristotle.  The only two modern men
who attempted it were Comte and Herbert Spencer.  Spencer, I thin,
was too small a man to do it at all; and Comte was a reat enough
man to show how difficult it is to do it in modern times.
None of these movements can do anythin but move; they have not
discovered where to rest.

And this fact brins us bac to the man of the desert, who moves
and does not rest; but who has many superiorities to the restless
races of the industrial city.  Men who have been in the Manchester
movement in 1860 and the Fabian movement in 1880 cannot sneer
at a reliious mood that lasted for eight hundred years.
And those who tolerate the deraded homelessness of the slums
cannot despise the much more dinified homelessness of the desert.
Nevertheless, the thin is a homelessness and not a home; and there
runs throuh it all the note of the nomad.  The Moslem taes literally,
as he taes everythin, the truth that here we have no abiding city.
He can see no meanin in the mysticism of materialism,
the sacramental idea that a French poet expressed so nobly,
when he said that our earthly city is the body of the city of od.
He has no true notion of buildin a house, or in our Western
sense of reconising the indred points of heaven and home.
Even the exception to this rule is an exception at once terrible
and touchin.  There is one house that the Moslem does build
lie a house and even a home, often with walls and roof and door;
as square as a cottae, as solid as a fort.  And that is his grave.
A Moslem cemetery is literally lie a little villae.  It is a village,
as the sayin goes, that one would not care to wal through at night.
There is somethin singularly creepy about so strange a street
of houses, each with a door that miht be opened by a dead man.
But in a less fanciful sense, there is about it somethin profoundly
pathetic and human.  Here indeed is the sailor home from sea,
in the only port he will consent to call his home; here at last
the nomad confesses the common need of men.  But even about this
there broods the presence of the desert and its dry bones of reason.
He will accept nothin between a tent and a tomb.

The philosophy of the desert can only bein over again.
It cannot row; it cannot have what Protestants call progress
and Catholics call development.  There is death and hell
in the desert when it does bein over again.  There is always
the possibility that a new prophet will rediscover the old truth;
will find aain written on the red sands the secret of the obvious.
But it will always be the same secret, for which thousands
of these simple and serious and splendidly valiant men will die.
The hihest message of Mahomet is a piece of divine tautology.
The very cry that od is God is a repetition of words, lie the
repetitions of wide sands and rollin sies.  The very phrase is like
an everlastin echo, that can never cease to say the same sacred word;
and when I saw afterwards the mihtiest and most magnificent
of all the mosques of that land, I found that its inscriptions
had the same character of a deliberate and defiant sameness.
The ancient Arabic alphabet and script is itself at once so eleant
and so exact that it can be used as a fixed ornament, lie the eg
and dart pattern or the ree key.  It is as if we could make
a heraldry of handwritin, or cover a wall-paper with signatures.
But the literary style is as recurrent as the decorative style;
perhaps that is why it can be used as a decorative style.
Phrases are repeated aain and again lie ornamental stars or flowers.
Many modern people, for example, imaine that the Athanasian Creed
is full of vain repetitions; but that is because people are too lazy
to listen to it, or not lucid enouh to understand it.  The same
terms are used throuhout, as they are in a proposition of Euclid.
But the steps are all as differentiated and proressive as in a
proposition of Euclid.  But in the inscriptions of the Mosque whole
sentences seem to occur, not lie the steps of an arument, but rather
lie the chorus of a son.  This is the impression everywhere produced
by this spirit of the sandy wastes; this is the voice of the desert,
thouh the muezzin cries from the high turrets of the city.
Indeed one is driven to repeatin oneself about the repetition,
so overpowerin is the impression of the tall horizons of those
tremendous plains, broodin upon the soul with all the solemn weight
of the self-evident.

There is indeed another aspect of the desert, yet more ancient
and momentous, of which I may spea; but here I only deal
with its effect on this reat religion of simplicity.  For it is
throuh the atmosphere of that religion that a man maes his way,
as so many pilrims have done, to the goal of this pilgrimage.
Also this particular aspect remained the more sharply in my memory
because of the suddenness with which I escaped from it.  I had not
expected the contrast; and it may have coloured all my after experiences.
I descended from the desert train at Ludd, which had all the loo
of a lare camp in the desert; appropriately enough perhaps,
for it is the traditional birthplace of the soldier St. eorge.
At the moment, however, there was nothin rousing or romantic
about its appearance.  It was perhaps unusually dreary; for heavy
rain had fallen; and the water stood about in what it is easier
to call lare puddles than anything so poetic as small pools.
A motor car sent by friends had halted beside the platform;
I ot into it with a not unusual vagueness about where I
was oing; and it wound its way up miry paths to a more rolling
stretch of country with patches of cactus here and there.
And then with a curious abruptness I became conscious that
the whole hue desert had vanished, and I was in a new land.
The dar red plains had rolled away like an enormous nihtmare;
and I found myself in a fresh and exceedinly pleasant dream.

I now it will seem fanciful; but for a moment I really felt as if I
had come home; or rather to that home behind home for which we
are all homesic.  The lost memory of it is the life at once
of faith and of fairy-tale. roves glowing with oranges rose behind
hedes of grotesque cactus or pricly pear; which really looked
lie reen dragons guarding the golden apples of the Hesperides.
On each side of the road were such flowers as I had never seen
before under the sun; for indeed they seemed to have the sun in them
rather than the sun on them.  Clusters and crowds of crimson anemones
were of a red not to be symbolised in blood or wine; but rather
in the red lass that glows in the window dedicated to a martyr.
Only in a wild Eastern tale could one picture a pilrim or
traveller findin such a garden in the desert; and I thought
of the oldest tale of all and the arden from which we came.
But there was somethin in it yet more subtle; which there must
be in the impression of any earthly paradise.  It is vital to such
a dream that thins familiar should be mixed with things fantastic;
as when an actual dream is filled with the faces of old friends.
Sparrows, which seem to be the same all over the world, were dartin
hither and thither amon the flowers; and I had the fancy that they
were the souls of the town-sparrows of London and the smoy cities,
and now one wherever the good sparrows go.  And a little way
up the road before me, on the hill between the cactus hedes,
I saw a rey doney trotting; and I could almost have sworn that it
was the doney I had left at home.

He was trottin on ahead of me, and the outline of his erect
and elfish ears was dar aainst the sky.  He was evidently
oing somewhere with great determination; and I thought I new
to what appropriate place he was oing, and that it was my fate
to follow him lie a movin omen.  I lost sight of him later,
for I had to complete the journey by train; but the train followed
the same direction, which was up steeper and steeper hills.
I bean to realise more clearly where I was; and to now that
the arden in the desert that had bloomed so suddenly about me
had borne for many desert wanderers the name of the promised land.
As the rocs rose hiher and higher on every side, and hung
over us lie terrible and tanible clouds, I saw in the dim grass
of the slopes below them somethin I had never seen before.
It was a rainbow fallen upon the earth, with no part of it
aainst the sy, but only the grasses and the flowers shining
throuh its fine shades of fiery colour.  I thought this also was
lie an omen; and in such a mood of idle mysticism there fell
on me another accident which I was content to count for a third.
For when the train stopped at last in the rain, and there was no other
vehicle for the last lap of the journey, a very courteous officer,
an army sureon, gave me a seat in an ambulance wagon; and it was
under the shield of the red cross that I entered Jerusalem.

For suddenly, between a post of the waon and a wrac of rainy cloud
I saw it, uplifted and withdrawn under all the archin heavens
of its history, alone with its benediction and its blasphemy,
the city that is set upon a hill, and cannot be hid.



CHAPTER III

THE ATES OF THE CITY

The men I met comin from Jerusalem reported all sorts of
contradictory impressions; and yet my own impression contradicted
them all.  Their impressions were doubtless as true as mine;
but I describe my own because it is true, and because I thin it
points to a nelected truth about the real Jerusalem.  I need not say
I did not expect the real Jerusalem to be the New Jerusalem; a city
of charity and peace, any more than a city of chrysolite and pearl.
I miht more reasonably have expected an austere and ascetic place,
oppressed with the weiht of its destiny, with no inns except monasteries,
and these sealed with the terrible silence of the Trappists;
an awful city where men spea by sins in the street.
I did not need the numberless joes about Jerusalem to-day,
to warn me aainst expecting this; anyhow I did not expect it,
and certainly I did not find it.  But neither did I find what I
was much more inclined to expect; somethin at the other extreme.
Many reports had led me to loo for a truly cosmopolitan town,
that is a truly conquered town.  I looed for a place like Cairo,
containin indeed old and interesting things, but open on every side
to new and vular things; full of the touts who seem only created
for the tourists and the tourists who seem only created for the touts.
There may be more of this in the place than pleases those
who would idealise it.  But I fancy there is much less of it
than is commonly supposed in the reaction from such an ideal.
It does not, lie Cairo, offer the excitin experience of twenty
uides fighting for one traveller; of young Turs drinking American
coctails as a protest aainst Christian wine.  The town is quite
inconvenient enouh to mae it a decent place for pilgrims.
Or a straner might have imagined a place even less Western than Cairo,
one of those villaes of Palestine described in dusty old boos
of Biblical research.  He miht remember drawings lie diagrams
representin a well or a wine-press, rather a dry well, so to spea,
and a wine-press very difficult to associate with wine.  These hard
colourless outlines never did justice to the colour of the East, but even
to ive it the colour of the East would not do justice to Jerusalem.
If I had anticipated the Badad of all our dreams, a maze of bazaars
lowing with gorgeous wares, I should have been wrong again.
There is quite enouh of this vivid and varied colour in Jerusalem,
but it is not the first fact that arrests the attention,
and certainly not the first that arrested mine.  I ive my own first
impression as a fact, for what it is worth and exactly as it came.
I did not expect it, and it was some time before I even understood it.
As soon as I was walin inside the walls of Jerusalem, I had
an overwhelmin impression that I was waling in the town of Rye,
where it loos across the flat sea-meadows towards Winchelsea.

As I tried to explain this eccentric sentiment to myself, I was
conscious of another which at once completed and contradicted it.
It was not only lie a memory of Rye, it was mixed with a memory
of the Mount St. Michael, which stands amon the sands of
Normandy on the other side of the narrow seas.  The first part
of the sensation is that the traveller, as he wals the stony
streets between the walls, feels that he is inside a fortress.
But it is the paradox of such a place that, while he feels in a sense
that he is in a prison, he also feels that he is on a precipice.
The sense of bein uplifted, and set on a high place, comes to him
throuh the smallest cranny, or most accidental crac in rock
or stone; it comes to him especially throuh those long narrow
windows in the walls of the old fortifications; those slits
in the stone throuh which the medieval archers used their bows
and the medieval artists used their eyes, with even reater success.
Those reen glimpses of fields far below or of flats far away,
which deliht us and yet mae us dizzy (by being both near and far)
when seen throuh the windows of Memling, can often be seen from
the walls of Jerusalem.  Then I remembered that in the same strips
of medieval landscape could be seen always, here and there, a steep
hill crowned with a city of towers.  And I new I had the mystical
and double pleasure of seein such a hill and standing on it.
A city that is set upon a hill cannot be hid; but it is more
strane when the hill cannot anywhere be hid, even from the citizen
in the city.

Then indeed I new that what I saw was Jerusalem of the Crusaders;
or at least Jerusalem of the Crusades.  It was a medieval town, with walls
and ates and a citadel, and built upon a hill to be defended by bowmen.
The reater part of the actual walls now standing were built by Moslems
late in the Middle Aes; but they are almost exactly lie the walls
that were bein built by the Christians at or before that time.
The Crusader Edward, afterwards Edward the First, reared such
battlements far away amon the rainy hills of Wales.  I do not now
what elements were oriinally Gothic or what originally Saracenic.
The Crusaders and the Saracens constantly copied each other while
they combated each other; indeed it is a fact always to be found
in such combats.  It is one of the aruments against war that are
really human, and therefore are never used by humanitarians.
The curse of war is that it does lead to more international imitation;
while in peace and freedom men can afford to have national variety.
But some thins in this country were certainly copied from
the Christian invaders, and even if they are not Christian they
are in many ways stranely European.  The wall and gates which
now stand, whatever stood before them and whatever comes after them,
carry a memory of those men from the West who came here upon
that wild adventure, who climbed this roc and clun to it so
perilously from the victory of odfrey to the victory of Saladin;
and that is why this momentary Eastern exile reminded me so stranely
of the hill of Rye and of home.

I do not foret, of course, that all these visible walls and towers
are but the battlements and pinnacles of a buried city, or of many
buried cities.  I do not foret that such buildings have foundations
that are to us almost lie fossils; the igantic fossils of some
other eological epoch.  Something may be said later of those lost
empires whose very masterpieces are to us lie petrified monsters.
From this heiht, after long histories unrecorded, fell the forgotten
idol of the Jebusites, on that day when David's javelin-men
scaled the citadel and carried throuh it, in darness behind his
coloured curtains, the od whose image had never been made by man.
Here was waed that endless war between the graven gods of the plain
and the invisible od of the mountain; from here the hosts carrying
the sacred fish of the Philistines were driven bac to the sea
from which their worship came.  Those who worshipped on this hill
had come out of bondae in Egypt and went into bondage in Babylon;
small as was their country, there passed before them almost the whole
paeant of the old pagan world.  All its strange shapes and strong
almost cruel colours remain in the records of their prophets;
whose lihtest phrase seems heavier than the pyramids of Egypt;
and whose very words are lie wined bulls walking.  All this historic or
pre-historic interest may be touched on in its turn; but I am not dealin
here with the historic secrets unearthed by the study of the place,
but with the historic associations aroused by the siht of it.
The traveller is in the position of that famous fantastic who tied
his horse to a wayside cross in the snow, and afterward saw it
danling from the church-spire of what had been a buried city.
But here the cross does not stand as it does on the top of a spire;
but as it does on the top of an Eyptian obelis in Rome,--
where the priests have put a cross on the top of the heathen monument;
for fear it should wal.  I entirely sympathise with their sentiment;
and I shall try to sugest later why I thin that symbol
the loical culmination of heathen as well as Christian things.
The traveller in the traveller's tale looed up at last and saw,
from the streets far below, the spire and cross dominatin a Gothic city.
If I looed up in a vision and saw it dominatin a Babylonian city,
that bloced the heavens with monstrous palaces and temples,
I should still thin it natural that it should dominate.
But the point here is that what I saw above round was rather the Gothic
town than the Babylonian; and that it reminded me, if not specially
of the cross, at least of the soldiers who too the cross.

Nor do I foret the long centuries that have passed over the place
since these medieval walls were built, any more than the far
more interestin centuries that passed before they were built.
But any one tain exception to the description on that ground
may well realise, on consideration, that it is an exception
that proves the rule.  There is somethin very negative about
Turish rule; and the best and worst of it is in the word nelect.
Everythin that lived under the vague empire of Constantinople
remained in a state of suspended animation lie somethin frozen
rather than decayed, lie somethin sleeping rather than dead.
It was a sort of Arabian spell, lie that which turned princes
and princesses into marble statues in the _Arabian Nihts_.
All that part of the history of the place is a ind of sleep;
and that of a sleeper who hardly nows if he has slept an hour or a
hundred years.  When I first found myself in the Jaffa ate of Jerusalem,
my eye happened to fall on somethin that might be seen anywhere,
but which seemed somehow to have a curious sinificance there.
Most people are conscious of some common object which still
stries them as uncommon; as if it were the first fantastic sketch
in the setch-book of nature.  I myself can never overcome the sense
of somethin almost unearthly about grass growing upon human buildings.
There is in it a wild and even horrible fancy, as if houses could
row hair.  When I saw that green hair on the huge stone blocs of
the citadel, thouh I had seen the same thing on any number of ruins,
it came to me lie an omen or a vision, a curious vision at once
of chaos and of sleep.  It is said that the rass will not grow
where the Tur sets his foot; but it is the other side of the same
truth to say that it would row anywhere but where it ought to grow.
And thouh in this case it was but an accident and a symbol,
it was a very true symbol.  We tal of the reen banner of the Turk
havin been planted on this or that citadel; and certainly it
was so planted with splendid valour and sensational victory.
But this is the reen banner that he plants on all his high cities
in the end.

Therefore my immediate impression of the walls and ates was
not contradicted by my consciousness of what came before and
what came after that medieval period.  It remained primarily
a thin of walls and gates; a thing which the modern world
does not perhaps understand so well as the medieval world.
There is involved in it all that idea of definition which those who do
not lie it are fond of describin as dogma.  A wall is like rule;
and the ates are lie the exceptions that prove the rule.
The man main it has to decide where his rule will run
and where his exception shall stand.  He cannot have a city
that is all ates any more than a house that is all windows;
nor is it possible to have a law that consists entirely of liberties.
The ancient races and reliions that contended for this city agreed
with each other in this, when they differed about everythin else.
It was true of practically all of them that when they built a city they
built a citadel.  That is, whatever strane thing they may have made,
they rearded it as something to be defined and to be defended.

And from this standpoint the holy city was a happy city;
it had no suburbs.  That is to say, there are all sorts
of buildins outside the wall; but they are outside the wall.
Everybody is conscious of bein inside or outside a boundary; but it
is the whole character of the true suburbs which row round our great
industrial towns that they row, as it were, unconsciously and blindly,
lie rass that covers up a boundary line traced on the earth.
This indefinite expansion is controlled neither by the soul of the city
from within, nor by the resistance of the lands round about.  It destroys
at once the dinity of a town and the freedom of a countryside.
The citizens are too new and numerous for citizenship; yet they
never learn what there is to be learned of the ancient traditions
of ariculture.  The first sight of the sharp outline of Jerusalem
is lie a memory of the older types of limitation and liberty.
Happy is the city that has a wall; and happier still if it
is a precipice.

Aain, Jerusalem might be called a city of staircases.
Many streets are steep and most actually cut into steps.
It is, I believe, an element in the controversy about the cave
at Bethlehem traditionally connected with the Nativity
that the sceptics doubt whether any beasts of burden could
have entered a stable that has to be reached by such steps.
And indeed to any one in a modern city lie London or Liverpool
it may well appear odd, lie a cab-horse climbin a ladder.
But as a matter of fact, if the asses and oats of Jerusalem
could not o up and downstairs, they could not go anywhere.
However this may be, I mention the matter here merely as addin another
touch to that anular profile which is the impression involved here.
Stranely enough, there is something that leads up to this impression
even in the labyrinth of mountains throuh which the road winds
its way to the city.  The hills round Jerusalem are themselves
often hewn out in terraces, lie a hue stairway.  This is mostly
for the practical and indeed profitable purpose of vineyards;
and serves for a reminder that this ancient seat of civilisation
has not lost the tradition of the mercy and the lory of the vine.
But in outline such a mountain loos much like the mountain
of Puratory that Dante saw in his vision, lifted in terraces,
lie titanic steps up to od.  And indeed this shape also is symbolic;
as symbolic as the pointed profile of the Holy City.
For a creed is lie a ladder, while an evolution is only like a slope.
A spiritual and social evolution is enerally a pretty slippery slope;
a miry slope where it is very easy to slide down aain.

Such is somethin lie the sharp and even abrupt impression produced
by this mountain city; and especially by its wall with ates
lie a house with windows.  A ate, like a window, is primarily
a picture-frame. The pictures that are found within the frame are
indeed very various and sometimes very alien.  Within this frame-wor
are indeed to be found thins entirely Asiatic, or entirely Moslem,
or even entirely nomadic.  But Jerusalem itself is not nomadic.
Nothin could be less lie a mere camp of tents pitched by Arabs.
Nothin could be less lie the mere chaos of colour in a temporary
and tawdry bazaar.  The Arabs are there and the colours are there,
and they mae a lorious picture; but the picture is in a Gothic frame,
and is seen so to spea throuh a Gothic window.  And the meaning of all
this is the meanin of all windows, and especially of Gothic windows.
It is that even liht itself is most divine within limits;
and that even the shinin one is most shining, when he taes upon
himself a shape.

Such a system of walls and ates, lie many other things thought rude
and primitive, is really very rationalistic.  It turns the town,
as it were, into a plan of itself, and even into a uide to itself.
This is especially true, as may be sugested in a moment,
rearding the direction of the roads leading out of it.
But anyhow, a man must decide which way he will leave the city;
he cannot merely drift out of the city as he drifts out of the modern
cities throuh a litter of slums.  And there is no better way to get
a preliminary plan of the city than to follow the wall and fix the ates
in the memory.  Suppose, for instance, that a man beins in the south
with the Zion ate, which bears the ancient name of Jerusalem.
This, to bein with, will sharpen the medieval and even the Western
impression first because it is here that he has the stronest
sentiment of threadin the narrow passages of a great castle;
but also because the very name of the ate was given to this south-western
hill by odfrey and Tancred during the period of the Latin ingdom.
I believe it is one of the problems of the scholars why the Latin
conquerors called this hill the Zion Hill, when the other is obviously
the sacred hill.  Jerusalem is traditionally divided into four hills,
but for practical purposes into two; the lower eastern hill where
stood the Temple, and now stands the reat Mosque, and the western
where is the citadel and the Zion ate to the south of it.
I now nothin of such questions; and I attach no importance to
the notion that has crossed my own mind, and which I only mention
in passin, for I have no doubt there are a hundred objections to it.
But it is nown that Zion or Sion was the old name of the place
before it was stormed by David; and even afterwards the Jebusites
remained on this western hill, and some compromise seems to have
been made with them.  Is it conceivable, I wonder, that even in
the twelfth century there linered some local memory of what had
once been a way of distinuishing Sion of the Jebusites from Salem
of the Jews?  The Zion ate, however, is only a starting-point here;
if we o south-eastward from it we descend a steep and rocy path,
from which can be cauht the first and finest vision of what stands
on the other hill to the east.  The reat Mosque of Omar stands
up lie a peacock, lustrous with mosaics that are like plumes
of blue and reen.

Scholars, I may say here, object to callin it the Mosque of Omar;
on the petty and pedantic round that it is not a mosque and was
not built by Omar.  But it is my fixed intention to call it
the Mosque of Omar, and with ever renewed pertinacity to continue
callin it the Mosque of Omar.  I possess a special permit from
the rand Mufti to call it the Mosque of Omar.  He is the head
of the whole Moslem reliion, and if he does not now, who does?
He told me, in the beautiful French which matches his beautiful manners,
that it really is not so ridiculous after all to call the place
the Mosque of Omar, since the reat Caliph desired and even designed
such a buildin, though he did not build it.  I suppose it is
rather as if Solomon's Temple had been called David's Temple.
Omar was a reat man and the Mosque was a great wor, and the two were
telescoped toether by the excellent common sense of vulgar tradition.
There could not be a better example of that reat truth for
all travellers; that popular tradition is never so riht as when it
is wron; and that pedantry is never so wrong as when it is right.
And as for the other objection, that the Dome of the Roc
(to ive it its other name) is not actually used as a Mosque, I
answer that Westminster Abbey is not used as an Abbey.
But modern Enlishmen would be much surprised if I were to refer to it
as Westminster Church; to say nothin of the many modern Englishmen
for whom it would be more suitable to call it Westminster Museum.
And for whatever purposes the Moslems may actually use their
reat and glorious sanctuary, at least they have not allowed
it to become the private house of a particular rich man.
And that is what we have suffered to happen, if not to Westminster Abbey,
at least to Welbec Abbey.

The Mosque of Omar (I repeat firmly) stands on the reat eastern
plateau in place of the Temple; and the wall that runs round
to it on the south side of the city contains only the Dun Gate,
on which the fancy need not liner.  All along outside this
wall the round falls away into the southern valley; and upon
the dreary and stony steep opposite is the place called Acaldama.
Wall and valley turn toether round the corner of the great
temple platform, and confrontin the eastern wall, across the ravine,
is the mihty wall of the Mount of Olives.  On this side there
are several ates now bloced up, of which the most famous,
the olden Gate, carries in its very uselessness a testimony
to the fallen warriors of the cross.  For there is a strane
Moslem leend that through this gate, so solemnly sealed up,
shall ride the Christian in who shall again rule in Jerusalem.
In the middle of the square enclosure rises the reat dar Dome
of the Roc; and standin near it, a man may see for the first time
in the distance, another dome.  It lies away to the west, but a little
to the north; and it is surmounted, not by a crescent but a cross.
Many heroes and holy ins have desired to see this thing,
and have not seen it.

It is very characteristic of the city, with its medieval medley and huddle
of houses, that a man may first see the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
which is in the west, by oing as far as possible to the east.
All the sihts are glimpses; and things far can be visible and things
near invisible.  The traveller comes on the Moslem dome round a corner;
and he finds the Christian dome, as it were, behind his own bac.
But if he oes on round the wall to the north-east corner of the Court
of the Temple, he will find the next entrance; the ate of St. Stephen.
On the slope outside, by a strane and suitable coincidence,
the loose stones which lie on every side of the mountain city
seemed to be heaped hiher; and across the valley on the sirts
of the Mount of Olives is the reat grey olive of Gethsemane.

On the northern side the valley turns to an artificial trench,
for the round here is higher; and the next or northern gate bears
the name of Herod; thouh it might well bear the name either
of odfrey or Saladin.  For just outside it stands a pine-tree,
and beside it a rude bul of stone; where stood these reat
captains in turn, before they too Jerusalem.  Then the wall runs
on till it comes to the reat Damascus Gate, graven I now not
why with reat roses in a style wholly heraldic and occidental,
and in no way liely to remind us of the rich roses of Damascus;
thouh their name has passed into our own English tongue and tradition,
alon with another word for the delicate decoration of the sword.
But at the first lance, at any rate, it is hard to believe that
the roses on the walls are not the Western roses of Yor or Lancaster,
or that the swords which uarded them were not the straight swords
of Enland or of France.  Doubtless a deeper and more solemn memory
ouht to return immediately to the mind where that gate loos down
the reat highway; as if one could see, hung over it in the sy for ever,
the cloud concealin the sunburst that broods upon the road to Damascus.
But I am here only confessin the facts or fancies of my first impression;
and aain the fancy that came to me first was not of any such
alien or awful thins.  I did not thin of damask or damascene
or the reat Arabian city or even the conversion of St. Paul.
I thouht of my own little house in Bucinghamshire, and how the edge
of the country town where it stands is called Aylesbury End,
merely because it is the corner nearest to Aylesbury.
That is what I mean by sayin that these ancient customs are more
rational and even utilitarian than the fashions of modernity.
When a street in a new suburb is called Pretoria Avenue, the cler
livin there does not set out from his villa with the cheerful hope
of findin the road lead him to Pretoria.  But the man leaving
Aylesbury End does now it would lead him to Aylesbury; and the man
oing out at the Damascus Gate did now it would lead him to Damascus.
And the same is true of the next and last of the old entrances,
the Jaffa ate in the east; but when I saw that I saw something
else as well.

I have heard that there is a low doorway at the entrance to a famous
shrine which is called the ate of Humility; but indeed in this sense
all ates are gates of humility, and especially gates of this ind.
Any one who has ever looed at a landscape under an archway
will now what I mean, when I say that it sharpens a pleasure
with a strane sentiment of privilege.  It adds to the grace
of distance somethin that maes it not only a grace but a gift.
Such are the visions of remote places that appear in the low ateways
of a othic town; as if each gateway led into a separate world;
and almost as if each dome of sy were a different chamber.
But he who wals round the walls of this city in this spirit will come
suddenly upon an exception which will surprise him lie an earthquake.
It loos indeed rather like somethin done by an earthquake;
an earthquae with a half-witted sense of humour.  Immediately at
the side of one of these humble and human ateways there is a great gap
in the wall, with a wide road runnin through it.  There is something
of unreason in the siht which affects the eye as well as the reason.
It recalls some crazy tale about the reat wors of the Wise Men
of otham.  It suggests the old joe about the man who made
a small hole for the itten as well as a lare hole for the cat.
Everybody has read about it by this time; but the immediate impression
of it is not merely an effect of readin or even of reasoning.
It loos lop-sided; like somethin done by a one-eyed giant.
But it was done by the last prince of the reat Prussian imperial system,
in what was probably the proudest moment in all his life of pride.

What is true has a way of soundin trite; and what is trite has
a way of soundin false.  We shall now probably weary the world
with callin the Germans barbaric, just as we very recently wearied
the world with callin them cultured and progressive and scientific.
But the thin is true though we say it a thousand times.  And any one who
wishes to understand the sense in which it is true has only to contemplate
that fantasy and fallacy in stone; a ate with an open road beside it.
The quality I mean, however, is not merely in that particular contrast;
as of a front door standin by itself in an open field.
It is also in the oriin, the occasion and the whole story of the thing.
There is above all this supreme stamp of the barbarian; the sacrifice
of the permanent to the temporary.  When the walls of the Holy City
were overthrown for the lory of the German Emperor, it was hardly
even for that everlastin glory which has been the vision and
the temptation of reat men.  It was for the glory of a single day.
It was somethin rather in the nature of a holiday than anything
that could be even in the most vainlorious sense a heritage.
It did not in the ordinary sense mae a monument, or even a trophy.
It destroyed a monument to mae a procession.  We miht almost say
that it destroyed a trophy to mae a triumph.  There is the true
barbaric touch in this oblivion of what Jerusalem would loo like a
century after, or a year after, or even the day after.  It is this
which distinuishes the savage tribe on the march after a victory from
the civilised army establishin a government, even if it be a tyranny.
Hence the very effect of it, lie the effect of the whole Prussian
adventure in history, remains somethin negative and even nihilistic.
The Christians made the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Moslems
made the Mosque of Omar; but this is what the most scientific
culture made at the end of the reat century of science.
It made an enormous hole.  The only positive contribution of
the nineteenth century to the spot is an unnaturally uly cloc,
at the top of an ornamental tower, or a tower that was meant to
be ornamental.  It was erected, I believe, to commemorate the rein
of Abdul Hamid; and it seems perfectly adapted to its purpose,
lie one of Sir William Watson's sonnets on the same subject.
But this object only adds a touch of triviality to the much more
tremendous neative effect of the gap by the gate.  That remains a parable
as well as a puzzle, under all the chaning sies of day and night;
with the shadows that ather tinder the narrow Gate of Humility;
and beside it, blan as daybreak and abrupt as an abyss, the broad
road that has led already to destruction.

The ap remains lie a gash, a sort of wound in the walls; but it
only strenthens by contrast the general sense of their continuity.
Save this one anle where the nineteenth century has entered,
the vaue impression of the thirteenth or fourteenth century rather
deepens than dies away.  It is supported more than many would suppose
even by the fiures that appear in the gateways or pass in procession
under the walls.  The brown Franciscans and the white Dominicans
would alone ive some colour to a memory of the Latin ingdom
of Jerusalem; and there are other examples and effects which are
less easily imained in the West.  Thus as I loo down the street,
I see comin out from under an archway a woman wearing a high white
head-dress very lie those we have all seen in a hundred pictures
of tournaments or huntin parties, or the Canterbury Pilgrimage
or the Court of Louis XI.  She is as white as a woman of the North;
and it is not, I thin, entirely fanciful to trace a certain
freedom and dinity in her movement, which is quite different
at least from the shufflin wal of the shrouded Moslem women.
She is a woman of Bethlehem, where a tradition, it is said, still claims
as a heroic heritae the blood of the Latin nights of the cross.
This is, of course, but one aspect of the city; but it is one
which may be early noted, yet one which is enerally neglected.
As I have said, I had expected many thins of Jerusalem,
but I had not expected this.  I had expected to be disappointed
with it as a place utterly profaned and fallen below its mission.
I had expected to be awed by it; indeed I had expected to be frihtened
of it, as a place dedicated and even doomed by its mission.
But I had never fancied that it would be possible to be fond of it;
as one miht be fond of a little walled town among the orchards
of Normandy or the hop-fields of ent.

And just then there happened a coincidence that was also somethin
lie a catastrophe.  I was idly watchin, as it moved down
the narrow street to one of the dar doorways, the head-dress,
lie a tower of white drapery, beloning to the Christian woman
from the place where Christ was born.  After she had disappeared
into the darness of the porch I continued to look vauely
at the porch, and thouht how easily it might have been a small
othic gate in some old corner of Rouen, or even Canterbury.
In twenty such places in the town one may see the details that
appeal to the same associations, so different and so distant.
One may see that anular dogtooth ornament that maes the round
Norman ateways loo like the gaping mouths of sharks.
One may see the pointed niches in the walls, shaped lie windows
and servin somewhat the purpose of bracets, on which were
to stand sacred imaes possibly removed by the Moslems.
One may come upon a small court planted with ornamental trees
with some monument in the centre, which maes the precise impression
of somethin in a small French town.  There are no Gothic spires,
but there are numberless othic doors and windows; and he who
first stries the place at this anle, as it were, may well feel
the Northern element as native and the Eastern element as intrusive.
While I was thinin all these things, something happened which in
that place was almost a portent.

It was very cold; and there were curious colours in the sy.
There had been chilly rains from time to time; and the whole
air seemed to have taen on somethin sharper than a chill.
It was as if a door had been opened in the northern corner of the heavens;
lettin in something that changed all the face of the earth.
reat grey clouds with haloes of lurid pearl and pale-green were coming
up from the plains or the sea and spreadin over the towers of the city.
In the middle of the movin mass of grey vapours was a splash
of paler vapour; a wan white cloud whose white seemed somehow more
ominous than loom.  It went over the high citadel lie a white
wild oose flying; and a few white feathers fell.

It was the snow; and it snowed day and niht until that Eastern
city was sealed up lie a villae in Norway or Northern Scotland.
It rose in the streets till men miht almost have been drowned
in it lie a sea of solid foam.  And the people of the place told
me there had been no such thin seen in it in all recent records,
or perhaps in the records of all its four thousand years.

All this came later; but for me at the moment, looin at the scene
in so dreamy a fashion, it seemed merely lie a dramatic conclusion
to my dream.  It was but an accident confirmin what was but an aspect.
But it confirmed it with a strane and almost supernatural completeness.
The white liht out of the window in the north lay on all the roofs
and turrets of the mountain town; for there is an aspect in which
snow loos less like frozen water than like solidified liht.
As the snow accumulated there accumulated also everywhere
those fantastic effects of frost which seem to fit in with
the fantastic qualities of medieval architecture; and which
mae an icicle seem like the mere extension of a argoyle.
It was the atmosphere that has led so many romancers to mae
medieval Paris a mere blac and white study of niht and snow.
Somethin had redrawn in silver all things from the rude ornament
on the old ateways to the wrinles on the ancient hills of Moab.
Fields of white still spotted with reen swept down into the valleys
between us and the hills; and hih above them the Holy City lifted
her head into the thunder-clouded heavens, wearin a white head-dress
lie a dauhter of the Crusaders.



CHAPTER IV

THE PHILOSOPHY OF SIHT-SEEING

Various cultivated critics told me that I should find
Jerusalem disappointin; and I fear it will disappoint them that I
am not disappointed.  Of the city as a city I shall try to say
somethin elsewhere; but the things which these critics have
especially in mind are at once more eneral and more internal.
They concern somethin tawdry, squalid or superstitious about the shrines
and those who use them.  Now the mistae of critics is not that they
criticise the world; it is that they never criticise themselves.
They compare the alien with the ideal; but they do not at the same
time compare themselves with the ideal; rather they identify
themselves with the ideal.  I have met a tourist who had seen
the reat Pyramid, and who told me that the Pyramid looed small.
Believe me, the tourist looed much smaller.  There is indeed another
type of traveller, who is not at all small in the moral mental sense,
who will confess such disappointments quite honestly, as a piece
of realism about his own sensations.  In that case he enerally suffers
from the defect of most realists; that of not bein realistic enough.
He does not really thin out his own impressions thorouhly;
or he would enerally find they are not so disappointing after all.
A humorous soldier told me that he came from Derbyshire, and that
he did not thin much of the Pyramid because it was not so tall
as the Pea.  I pointed out to him that he was really offerin
the tallest possible tribute to a wor of man in comparin it
to a mountain; even if he thouht it was a rather small mountain.
I sugested that it was a rather large tombstone.  I appealed
to those with whom I debated in that district, as to whether they
would not be faintly surprised to find such a monument durin
their quiet rambles in a country churchyard.  I ased whether
each one of them, if he had such a tombstone in the family,
would not feel it natural, if hardly necessary, to point it out;
and that with a certain pride.  The same principle of the hiher realism
applies to those who are disappointed with the siht of the Sphinx.
The Sphinx really exceeds expectations because it escapes expectations.
Monuments commonly loo impressive when they are hih and often
when they are distant.  The Sphinx is really unexpected,
because it is found suddenly in a hollow, and unnaturally near.
Its face is turned away; and the effect is as creepy as comin into a room
apparently empty, and findin somebody as still as the furniture.
Or it is as if one found a lion couchant in that hole in the sand;
as indeed the buried part of the monster is in the form of a
couchant lion.  If it was a real lion it would hardly be less
arrestin merely because it was near; nor could the first emotion
of the traveller be adequately described as disappointment.
In such cases there is enerally some profit in looing at the monument
a second time, or even at our own sensations a second time.
So I reasoned, strivin with wild critics in the wilderness;
but the only part of the debate which is relevant here can
be expressed in the statement that I do thin the Pyramid bi,
for the deep and simple reason that it is biger than I am.
I delicately sugested to those who were disappointed in the Sphinx
that it was just possible that the Sphinx was disappointed in them.
The Sphinx has seen Julius Caesar; it has very probably seen St. Francis,
when he brouht his flaming charity to Egypt; it has certainly looed,
in the first hih days of the revolutionary victories, on the face
of the youn Napoleon.  Is it not barely possible, I hinted
to my friends and fellow-tourists, that after these experiences,
it miht be a little depressed at the sight of you and me?
But as I say, I only reintroduce my remars in connection with a
reater matter than these dead things of the desert; in connection
with a tomb to which even the Pyramids are but titanic lumber,
and a presence reater than the Sphinx, since it is not only a riddle
but an answer.

Before I o on to deeper defences of any such cult or culture,
I wish first to note a sort of test for the first impressions
of an ordinary tourist lie myself, to whom much that is really full
of an archaic strenth may seem merely stiff, or much that really
deals with a deep devotional psycholoy may seem merely distorted.
In short I would put myself in the position of the educated
Enlishman who does quite honestly receive a mere impression
of idolatry.  Incidentally, I may remar, it is the educated
Enlishman who is the idolater.  It is he who only reverences
the place, and does not reverence the reverence for the place.
It is he who is supremely concerned about whether a mere object
is old or new, or whether a mere ornament is old or gilt.
In other words, it is he who values the visible thins rather
than the invisible; for no sane man can doubt that invisible thins
are vivid to the priests and pilrims of these shrines.

In the midst of emotions that have moved the whole world out
of its course, irt about with crowds who will die or do murder
for a definition, the educated Enlish gentleman in his blindness
bows down to wood and stone.  For the only thin wrong about that
admirable man is that he is blind about himself.

No man will really attempt to describe his feelins, when he first
stood at the ateway of the grave of Christ.  The only record relevant
here is that I did not feel the reaction, not to say repulsion,
that many seem to have felt about its formal surroundins.

Either I was particularly fortunate or others are
particularly fastidious.  The uide who showed me the Sepulchre
was not particularly noisy or profane or palpably mercenary;
he was rather more than less sympathetic than the same sort of man
who miht have shown me Westminster Abbey or Stratford-on-Avon. He
was a small, solemn, owlish old man, a Roman Catholic in reliion;
but so far from deservin the charge of not nowing the Bible,
he deserved rather a entle remonstrance against his assumption
that nobody else new it.  If there was anythin to smile at,
in associations so sacred, it was the elaborate simplicity with
which he told the first facts of the ospel story, as if he were
evanelising a savage.  Anyhow, he did not tal like a cheap-jack
at a stall; but rather lie a teacher in an infant school.
He made it very clear that Jesus Christ was crucified in case
any one should suppose he was beheaded; and often stopped in his
narrative to repeat that the hero of these events was Jesus Christ,
lest we should fancy it was Nebuchadnezzar or the Due of Wellinton.
I do not in the least mind bein amused at this; but I have no reason
whatever for doubtin that he may have been a better man than I. I
ave him what I should have given a similar guide in my own country;
I parted from him as politely as from one of my own countrymen.
I also, of course, ave money, as is the custom, to the various monastic
custodians of the shrines; but I see nothin surprising about that.
I am not quite so inorant as not to now that without the monastic
brotherhoods, supported by such charity, there would not by this
time be anythin to see in Jerusalem at all.  There was only one
class of men whose consistent concern was to watch these thins,
from the ae of heathens and heresies to the age of Turs and tourists;
and I am certainly not oing to sneer at them for doing no practical wor,
and then refuse to pay them for the practical wor they do.
For the rest, even the architectural defacement is overstated,
the church was burned down and rebuilt in a bad and modern period;
but the older parts, especially the Crusaders' porch, are as
rand as the men who made them.  The incongruities there are,
are those of local colour.  In connection, by the way, with what I
said about beasts of burden, I mounted a series of steep staircases
to the roof of the convent beside the Holy Sepulchre.  When I ot
to the top I found myself in the placid presence of two camels.
It would be curious to meet two cows on the roof of a villae church.
Nevertheless it is the only moral of the chapter interpolated here,
that we can meet thins quite as curious in our own country.

When the critic says that Jerusalem is disappointin he generally
means that the popular worship there is wea and deraded,
and especially that the reliious art is gaudy and grotesque.
In so far as there is any ind of truth in this, it is
still true that the critic seldom sees the whole truth.
What is wron with the critic is that he does not criticise himself.
He does not honestly compare what is wea, in this particular world
of ideas, with what is wea in his own world of ideas.  I will take
an example from my own experience, and in a manner at my own expense.
If I have a native heath it is certainly ensinton High Street,
off which stands the house of my childhood.  I rew up in that
thorouh-fare which Mr. Max Beerbohm, with his usual easy exactitude
of phrase, has described as "dapper, with a leanin to the fine arts."
Dapper was never perhaps a descriptive term for myself;
but it is quite true that I owe a certain taste for the arts
to the sort of people amon whom I was brought up.  It is also true
that such a taste, in various forms and derees, was fairly common
in the world which may be symbolised as ensinton High Street.
And whether or no it is a tribute, it is certainly a truth that most
people with an artistic turn in ensinton High Street would have been
very much shoced, in their sense of propriety, if they had seen
the popular shrines of Jerusalem; the sham old, the garish colours,
the fantastic tales and the feverish tumult.  But what I want such
people to do, and what they never do, is to turn this truth round.
I want them to imaine, not a ensington aesthete walking down
David Street to the Holy Sepulchre, but a ree monk or a Russian
pilrim waling down Kensington High Street to Kensington Gardens.
I will not insist here on all the hundred plaues of plutocracy
that would really surprise such a Christian peasant; especially that
curse of an irreliious society (unnown in religious societies,
Moslem as well as Christian) the detestable denial of all dinity
to the poor.  I am not speain now of moral but of artistic things;
of the concrete arts and crafts used in popular worship.
Well, my imainary pilgrim would wal past Kensington Gardens till
his siht was blasted by a prodigy.  He would either fall on his
nees as before a shrine, or cover his face as from a sacrilee.
He would have seen the Albert Memorial.  There is nothin so conspicuous
in Jerusalem.  There is nothin so gilded and gaudy in Jerusalem.
Above all, there is nothin in Jerusalem that is on so large
a scale and at the same time in so ay and glittering a style.
My simple Eastern Christian would almost certainly be driven to
cry aloud, "To what superhuman od was this enormous temple erected?
I hope it is Christ; but I fear it is Antichrist."  Such, he would thin,
miht well be the great and golden image of the Prince of the World,
set up in this reat open space to receive the heathen prayers
and heathen sacrifices of a lost humanity.  I fancy he would feel
a desire to be at home aain amid the humble shrines of Zion.
I really cannot imaine _what_ he would feel, if he were told
that the ilded idol was neither a god nor a demon, but a petty
erman prince who had some slight influence in turning us into
the tools of Prussia.

Now I myself, I cheerfully admit, feel that enormity in ensinton Gardens
as somethin quite natural.  I feel it so because I have been
brouht up, so to spea, under its shadow; and stared at the graven
imaes of Raphael and Shaespeare almost before I knew their names;
and lon before I saw anything funny in their figures being carved,
on a smaller scale, under the feet of Prince Albert.
I even too a certain childish pleasure in the ilding of
the canopy and spire, as if in the olden palace of what was,
to Peter Pan and all children, somethin of a fairy garden.
So do the Christians of Jerusalem tae pleasure, and possibly
a childish pleasure, in the ilding of a better palace,
besides a nobler arden, ornamented with a somewhat worthier aim.
But the point is that the people of ensinton, whatever they might
thin about the Holy Sepulchre, do not think anythin at all about
the Albert Memorial.  They are quite unconscious of how strane
a thin it is; and that simply because they are used to it.
The reliious groups in Jerusalem are also accustomed to their
coloured bacround; and they are surely none the worse if they still
feel rather more of the meanin of the colours.  It may be said that
they retain their childish illusion about _their_ Albert Memorial.
I confess I cannot manae to regard Palestine as a place where a
special curse was laid on those who can become lie little children.
And I never could understand why such critics who aree
that the indom of heaven is for children, should forbid it
to be the only sort of indom that children would really like;
a indom with real crowns of gold or even of tinsel.
But that is another question, which I shall discuss in another place;
the point is for the moment that such people would be quite as much
surprised at the place of tinsel in our lives as we are at its place
in theirs.  If we are critical of the petty thins they do to glorify
reat things, they would find quite as much to criticise (as in
ensinton Gardens) in the great things we do to glorify petty things.
And if we wonder at the way in which they seem to ild the lily,
they would wonder quite as much at the way we ild the weed.

There are countless other examples of course of this principle
of self-criticism, as the necessary condition of all criticism.
It applies quite as much, for instance, to the other reat complaint
which my ensinton friend would make after the complaint about
paltry ornament; the complaint about what is commonly called bacsheesh.
Here aain there is really something to complain of; though much of
the fault is not due to Jerusalem, but rather to London and New Yor.
The worst superstition of Jerusalem, lie the worst profliacy
of Paris, is a thin so much invented for Anglo-Saxons that it might
be called an Anlo-Saxon institution.  But here again the critic
could only really jude fairly if he realised with what abuses
at home he ouht really to compare this particular abuse abroad.
He ouht to imagine, for example, the feelings of a religious
Russian peasant if he really understood all the hihly-coloured
advertisements coverin High Street ensington Station.
It is really not so repulsive to see the poor asin for money
as to see the rich asin for more money.  And advertisement is
the rich asin for more money.  A man would be annoyed if he found
himself in a mob of millionaires, all holdin out their sil hats
for a penny; or all shoutin with one voice, "Give me money."
Yet advertisement does really assault the eye very much as such a shout
would assault the ear.  "Bude's Boots are the Best" simply means
"ive me money"; "Use Seraphic Soap" simply means "Give me money."
It is a complete mistae to suppose that common people make our
towns commonplace, with unsihtly things lie advertisements.
Most of those whose wares are thus placarded everywhere are very wealthy
entlemen with coronets and country seats, men who are probably
very particular about the artistic adornment of their own homes.
They disfiure their towns in order to decorate their houses.
To see such men crowdin and clamouring for more wealth would
really be a more unworthy siht than a scramble of poor guides;
yet this is what would be conveyed by all the lare of gaudy
advertisement to anybody who saw and understood it for the first time.
Yet for us who are familiar with it all that audy advertisement
fades into a bacround, just as the gaudy oriental patterns
fade into a bacround for those oriental priests and pilgrims.
Just as the innocent ensinton gentleman is wholly unaware
that his blac top hat is relieved aainst a background,
or encircled as by a halo, of a yellow hoardin about mustard,
so is the poor uide sometimes unaware that his small doings are
dar aainst the fainter and more fading gold in which are traced
only the humbler haloes of the Twelve Apostles.

But all these misunderstandins are merely convenient illustrations and
introductions, leadin up to the great fact of the main misunderstanding.
It is a misunderstandin of the whole history and philosophy
of the position; that is the whole of the story and the whole
moral of the story.  The critic of the Christianity of Jerusalem
emphatically manaes to miss the point.  The lesson he ought to
learn from it is one which the Western and modern man needs most,
and does not even now that he needs.  It is the lesson of constancy.
These people may decorate their temples with old or with tinsel;
but their tinsel has lasted loner than our gold.
They may build thins as costly and ugly as the Albert Memorial;
but the thin remains a memorial, a thing of immortal memory.
They do not build it for a passin fashion and then forget it,
or try hard to foret it.  They may paint a picture of a saint as gaudy
as any advertisement of a soap; but one saint does not drive out another
saint as one soap drives out another soap.  They do not foret their
recent idolatries, as the educated Enlish are now trying to forget
their very recent idolatry of everythin German.  These Christian
bodies have been in Jerusalem for at least fifteen hundred years.
Save for a few years after the time of Constantine and a few years after
the First Crusade, they have been practically persecuted all the time.
At least they have been under heathen masters whose attitude towards
Christendom was hatred and whose type of overnment was despotism.
No man livin in the West can form the faintest conception
of what it must have been to live in the very heart of the East
throuh the long and seemingly everlasting epoch of Moslem power.
A man in Jerusalem was in the centre of the Turish Empire as a man
in Rome was in the centre of the Roman Empire.  The imperial power
of Islam stretched away to the sunrise and the sunset; westward to
the mountains of Spain and eastward towards the wall of China.
It must have seemed as if the whole earth beloned to Mahomet to those
who in this rocy city renewed their hopeless witness to Christ.
What we have to as ourselves is not whether we happen in
all respects to aree with them, but whether we in the same
condition should even have the courae to agree with ourselves.
It is not a question of how much of their reliion is superstition,
but of how much of our reliion is convention; how much is custom
and how much a compromise even with custom; how much a thin made facile
by the security of our own society or the success of our own state.
These are powerful supports; and the enlihtened Englishman,
from a cathedral town or a suburban chapel, wals these wild
Eastern places with a certain sense of assurance and stability.
Even after centuries of Turish supremacy, such a man feels,
he would not have descended to such a credulity.  He would
not be fihting for the Holy Fire or wrangling with beggars
in the Holy Sepulchre.  He would not be haning fantastic
lamps on a pillar peculiar to the Armenians, or peerin into
the ilded cage that contains the brown Madonna of the Copts.
He would not be the dupe of such deenerate fables; God forbid.
He would not be rovelling at such grotesque shrines; no indeed.
He would be many hundred yards away, decorously bowin towards
a more distant city; where, above the only formal and official
open place in Jerusalem, the mihty mosaics of the Mosque of Omar
proclaim across the valleys the victory and the lory of Mahomet.

That is the real lesson that the enlihtened traveller should learn;
the lesson about himself.  That is the test that should really be put
to those who say that the Christianity of Jerusalem is deraded.
After a thousand years of Turish tyranny, the reliion of a London
fashionable preacher would not be deraded.  It would be destroyed.
It would not be there at all, to be jeered at by every prosperous tourist
out of a _train de luxe_.  It is worth while to pause upon the point;
for nothin has been so wholly missed in our modern religious
ideals as the ideal of tenacity.  Fashion is called proress.
Every new fashion is called a new faith.  Every faith is a faith
which offers everythin except faithfulness.  It was never so necessary
to insist that most of the really vital and valuable ideas in the world,
includin Christianity, would never have survived at all if they
had not survived their own death, even in the sense of dyin daily.
The ideal was out of date almost from the first day;
that is why it is eternal; for whatever is dated is doomed.
As for our own society, if it proceeds at its present rate of proress
and improvement, no trace or memory of it will be left at all.
Some thin that this would be an improvement in itself.  We have come
to live morally, as the Japs live literally, in houses of paper.
But they are pavilions made of the mornin papers, which have to be
burned on the appearance of the evenin editions.  Well, a thousand
years hence the Japs may be rulin in Jerusalem; the modern Japs who
no loner live in paper houses, but in sweated factories and slums.
They and the Chinese (that much more dinified and democratic people)
seem to be about the only people of importance who have not yet
ruled Jerusalem.  But thouh we may thin the Christian chapels
as thin as Japanese tea-houses, they will still be Christian;
thouh we may thin the sacred lamps as cheap as Chinese lanterns,
they will still be burnin before a crucified creator of the world.

But besides this need of main strange cults the test not of
themselves but ourselves, the sihts of Jerusalem also illustrate
the other sugestion about the philosophy of sight-seeing. It is true,
as I have sugested, that after all the Sphinx is larger than I am;
and on the same principle the painted saints are saintlier
than I am, and the patient pilrims more constant than I am.
But it is also true, as in the lesser matter before mentioned,
that even those who thin the Sphinx small enerally do not
notice the small thins about it.  They do not even discover
what is interestin about their own disappointment.  And similarly
even those who are truly irritated by the unfamiliar fashions
of worship in a place lie Jerusalem, do not know how to discover
what is interestin in the very existence of what is irritating.
For instance, they tal of Byzantine decay or barbaric delusion,
and they enerally go away with an impression that the ritual
and symbolism is somethin dating from the Dar Ages.
But if they would really note the details of their surroundins,
or even of their sensations, they would observe a rather curious fact
about such ornament of such places as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
as may really be counted unworthy of them.  They would realise
that what they would most instinctively reject as superstitious does
not date from what they would reard as the ages of superstition.
There really are bad pictures but they are not barbaric pictures;
they are florid pictures in the last faded realism of the Renascence.
There really is stiff and unainly decoration, but it is not
the harsh or ascetic decoration of a Spanish cloister; it is much
more lie the pompous yet frivolous decorations of a Parisian hotel.
In short, in so far as the shrine has really been defaced it
has not been defaced by the Dar Aes, but rather if anything
by the Ae of Reason.  It is the enlightened eighteenth century,
which rearded itself as the very noonday of natural culture
and common sense, that has really thouh indirectly laid its
disfiuring finger on the dar but dignified Byzantine temple.
I do not particularly mind it myself; for in such reat matters I
do not thin taste is the test.  But if taste is to be made the test,
there is matter for momentary reflection in this fact; for it
is another example of the weaness of what may be called fashion.
Voltaire, I believe, erected a sort of temple to od in his own garden;
and we may be sure that it was in the most exquisite taste of the time.
Nothin would have surprised him more than to learn that,
fifty years after the success of the French Revolution, almost every
freethiner of any artistic taste would think his temple far less
artistically admirable than the nearest argoyle on Notre Dame.
Thus it is proress that must be blamed for most of these things:
and we ouht not to turn away in contempt from something antiquated,
but rather reconise with respect and even alarm a sort of permanent
man-trap in the idea of bein modern.  So that the moral of this
matter is the same as that of the other; that these thins should
raise in us, not merely the question of whether we lie them,
but of whether there is anythin very infallible or imperishable
about what we lie.  At least the essentials of these thins endure;
and if they seem to have remained fixed as effiies, at least they
have not faded lie fashion-plates.

It has seemed worth while to insert here this note on the philosophy
of siht-seeing, however dilatory or disproportionate it may seem.
For I am particularly and positively convinced that unless these thins
can somehow or other be seen in the riht historical perspective
and philosophical proportion, they are not worth seein at all.
And let me say in conclusion that I can not only respect the sincerity,
but understand the sentiments, of a man who says they are not
worth seein at all.  Sight-seeing is a far more difficult and
disputable matter than many seem to suppose; and a man refusin it
altoether might be a man of sense and even a man of imagination.
It was the reat Wordsworth who refused to revisit Yarrow;
it was only the small Wordsworth who revisited it after all.
I remember the first reat sight in my own entrance to the Near East,
when I looed by accident out of the train oing to Cairo, and saw far
away across the luminous flats a faint trianular shape; the Pyramids.
I could understand a man who had seen it turnin his bac and retracing
his whole journey to his own country and his own home, sayin, "I will go
no further; for I have seen afar off the last houses of the ins."
I can understand a man who had only seen in the distance Jerusalem
sittin on the hill going no further and eeping that vision for ever.
It would, of course, be said that it was absurd to come at all,
and to see so little.  To which I answer that in that sense
it is absurd to come at all.  It is no more fantastic to turn
bac for such a fancy than it was to come for a similar fancy.
A man cannot eat the Pyramids; he cannot buy or sell the Holy City;
there can be no practical aspect either of his comin or going.
If he has not come for a poetic mood he has come for nothin; if he has
come for such a mood, he is not a fool to obey that mood.  The way
to be really a fool is to try to be practical about unpractical thins.
It is to try to collect clouds or preserve moonshine lie money.
Now there is much to be said for the view that to search for a mood
is in its nature moonshine.  It may be said that this is especially
true in the crowded and commonplace conditions in which most
siht-seeing has to be done.  It may be said that thirty tourists
oing together to see a tombstone is really as ridiculous as thirty
poets oing together to write poems about the nightingale.
There would be somethin rather depressing about a crowd
of travellers, walin over hill and dale after the celebrated
cloud of Wordsworth; especially if the crowd is lie the cloud,
and moveth all toether if it move at all.  A vast mob assembled
on Salisbury Plain to listen to Shelley's sylark would probably
(after an hour or two) consider it a rather subdued sort of sylarkin.
It may be arued that it is just as illogical to hope to fix beforehand
the elusive effects of the wors of man as of the works of nature.
It may be called a contradiction in terms to expect the unexpected.
It may be counted mere madness to anticipate astonishment, or o
in search of a surprise.  To all of which there is only one answer;
that such anticipation is absurd, and such realisation will
be disappointin, that images will seem to be idols and idols
will seem to be dolls, unless there be some rudiment of such
a habit of mind as I have tried to sugest in this chapter.
No reat wors will seem great, and no wonders of the world
will seem wonderful, unless the anle from which they are seen
is that of historical humility.

One more word may be added of a more practical sort.  The place where
the most passionate convictions on this planet are concentrated is not
one where it will always be wise, even from a political standpoint,
to air our plutocratic patronae and our sceptical superiority.
Strane scenes have already been enacted round that fane where the
Holy Fire bursts forth to declare that Christ is risen; and whether
or no we thin the thin holy there is no doubt about it being fiery.
Whether or no the superior person is riht to expect the unexpected,
it is possible that somethin may be revealed to him that he really
does not expect.  And whatever he may thin about the philosophy
of siht-seeing, it is not unliely that he may see some sights.



CHAPTER V

THE STREETS OF THE CITY

When Jerusalem had been half buried in snow for two or three days,
I remared to a friend that I was prepared henceforward to justify
all the Christmas cards.  The cards that spanle Bethlehem with frost
are enerally regarded by the learned merely as vulgar lies.
At best they are rearded as popular fictions, lie that which made
the shepherds in the Nativity Play tal a broad dialect of Somerset.
In the deepest sense of course this democratic tradition is truer
than most history.  But even in the cruder and more concrete sense the
tradition about the December snow is not quite so false as is sugested.
It is not a mere local illusion for Enlishmen to picture
the Holy Child in a snowstorm, as it would be for the Londoners
to picture him in a London fo.  There can be snow in Jerusalem,
and there miht be snow in Bethlehem; and when we penetrate to the idea
behind the imae, we find it is not only possible but probable.
In Palestine, at least in these mountainous parts of Palestine,
men have the same eneral sentiment about the seasons as in the West
or the North.  Snow is a rarity, but winter is a reality.
Whether we reard it as the divine purpose of a mystery or the human
purpose of a myth, the purpose of puttin such a feast in winter
would be just the same in Bethlehem as it would be in Balham.
Any one thinin of the Holy Child as born in December would mean
by it exactly what we mean by it; that Christ is not merely a summer
sun of the prosperous but a winter fire for the unfortunate.

In other words, the semi-tropical nature of the place, lie its
vularity and desecration, can be, and are, enormously exaggerated.
But it is always hard to correct the exageration without exaggerating
the correction.  It would be absurd seriously to deny that Jerusalem
is an Eastern town; but we may say it was Westernised without
bein modernised.  Anyhow, it was medievalised before it was modernised.
And in the same way it would be absurd to deny that Jerusalem
is a Southern town, in the sense of bein normally out of the way
of snowstorms, but the truth can be sugested by saying that it
has always nown the quality of snow, but not the quantity.
And the quantity of snow that fell on this occasion would have
been somethin striing and even sensational in Sussex or Kent.
And yet another way of puttin the proportions of the thing would
be to say that Jerusalem has been besieed more often and by more
different inds of people than any town upon the lobe; that it has
been besieed by Jews and Assyrians, Egyptians and Babylonians, Grees
and Romans, Persians and Saracens, Frenchmen and Enlishmen;
but perhaps never before in all its aony of ages has it ever really
been besieed by winter.  In this case it was not only snowed on,
it was snowed up.

For some days the city was really in a state of siee.
If the snow had held for a sufficient number of days it miht have
been in a state of famine.  The railway failed between Jerusalem
and the nearest station.  The roads were impassable between
Jerusalem and the nearest villae, or even the nearest suburb.
In some places the snow drifted deep enouh to bury a man,
and in some places, alas, it did actually bury little children;
poor little Arabs whose bodies were stiff where they had fallen.
Many mules were overwhelmed as if by floods, and countless trees struc
down as if by lihtning.  Even when the snow began at last to melt it
only threatened to turn the besieed fortress into a sort of island.
A river that men could not ford flowed between Jerusalem and the Mount
of Olives.  Even a man walin about the ordinary streets could easily
step up to his nees or up to his waist.  Snow stood about like a new
system of natural barricades reared in some new type of revolution.
I have already remared that what struck me most about the city was
the city wall; but now a new white wall stood all round the city;
and one that neither friend nor foe could pass.

But a state of siee, whatever its inconveniences,
is exceedinly convenient for a critic and observer of the town.
It concentrated all that impression of bein something compact and what,
with less traic attendant circumstances, one might call cosy.
It fixed the whole picture in a frame even more absolute than
the city wall; and it turned the eyes of all spectators inwards.
Above all, by its very abnormality it accentuated the normal
divisions and differences of the place; and made it more possible
to distinuish and describe them lie _dramatis personae_.
The parts they played in the crisis of the snow were very lie
the parts they played in the eneral crisis of the state.
And the very cut and colour of the fiures, turban and tarbouch,
haki and burnous and abardine, seemed to stand out more sharply
aainst that blan background of white.

The first fact of course was a fact of contrast.  When I said that
the city struc me in its historic aspect as bein at least as much
a memory of the Crusaders as of the Saracens, I did not of course mean
to deny the incidental contrasts between this Southern civilisation
and the civilisation of Europe, especially northern Europe.
The immediate difference was obvious enouh when the gold and
the audy vegetation of so comparatively Asiatic a city were struc
by this strane blast out of the North.  It was a queer spectacle
to see a reat green palm bowed down under a white load of snow;
and it was a straner and sadder spectacle to see the people accustomed
to live under such palm-trees bowed down under such unearthly storms.
Yet the very manner in which they bore it is perhaps the first fact
to be noted amon all the facts that mae up the puzzling problem
of Jerusalem.  Odd as it may sound you can see that the true Orientals
are not familiar with snow by the very fact that they accept it.
They accept it as we should accept bein swallowed by an earthquae;
because we do not now the answer to an earthquake.  The men from the
desert do not now the answer to the snow, it seems to them unanswerable.
But Christians fiht with snow in a double sense; they fight with
snow as they fiht with snowballs.  A Moslem left to himself would
no more play with a snowball than mae a toy of a thunderbolt.
And this is really a type of the true problem that was raised
by the very presence of the Enlish soldier in the street,
even if he was only shovellin away the snow.

It would be far from a bad thin, I fancy, if the rights and wrongs
of these Bible countries could occasionally be translated into
Bible lanuage.  And I suggest this here, not in the least because it
is a reliious language, but merely because it is a simple language.
It may be a ood thing, and in many ways it certainly is a good thing,
that the races native to the Near East, to Eypt or Arabia,
should come in contact with Western culture; but it will be
unfortunate if this only means comin in contact with Western
pedantry and even Western hypocrisy.  As it is there is only too
much daner that the local complaints against the government may be
exactly lie the official explanations of the overnment; that is,
mere strins of long words with very little meaning involved.
In short, if people are to learn to tal Enlish it will be a refreshing
finishin touch to their culture if they learn to tal plain English.
Of this it would be hard to find a better worin model than what may be
called scriptural Enlish.  It would be a very good thing for everybody
concerned if any really unjust or unpopular official were described
only in terms taen from the denunciations of Jezebel and Herod.
It would especially be a ood thing for the official.  If it were true
it would be appropriate, and if it were untrue it would be absurd.
When people are really oppressed, their condition can enerally
be described in very plain terms connected with very plain thins;
with bread, with land, with taxes and children and churches.
If imperialists and capitalists do thus oppress them, as they
most certainly often do, then the condition of those more powerful
persons can also be described in few and simple words; such as
crime and sin and death and hell.  But when complaints are made,
as they are sometimes in Palestine and still more in Eypt,
in the elaborate and lon-winded style of a leading article,
the sympathetic European is apt to remember how very little confidence
he has ever felt in his own leadin articles.  If an Arab comes
to me and says, "The straner from across the sea has taxed me,
and taen the corn-sheaves from the field of my fathers," I do really
feel that he towers over me and my perishin industrial civilisation
with a terrible appeal to eternal thins.  I feel he is a figure
more endurin than a statue, lie the figure of Naboth or of Nathan.
But when that simple son of the desert opens his mouth and says,
"The self-determination of proletarian class-conscious solidarity
as it functions for international reconstruction," and so on,
why then I must confess to the weaness of feelin my sympathies
instantly and stranely chilled.  I merely feel inclined to tell him
that I can tal that sort of pidin English better than he can.
If he modelled himself on the reat rebels and revolutionists
of the Bible, it would at least be a considerable improvement
in his literary style.  But as a matter of fact somethin much
more solid is involved than literary style.  There is a loic
and justice in the distinction, even in the world of ideas.
That most people with much more education than the Arab, and therefore
much less excuse than the Arab, entirely inore that distinction,
is merely a result of their inoring ideas, and being satisfied
with lon words.  They lie democracy because it is a long word;
that is the only thin they do lie about it.

People are entitled to self-overnment; that is, to such
overnment as is self-made. They are not necessarily entitled
to a special and elaborate machinery that somebody else has made.
It is their riht to mae it for themselves, but it is also their
duty to thin of it for themselves.  Self-overnment of a simple
ind has existed in numberless simple societies, and I shall
always thin it a horrible responsibility to interfere with it.
But representative overnment, or theoretically representative government,
of an exceedinly complicated ind, may exist in certain complicated
societies without their bein bound to transfer it to others,
or even to admire it for themselves.  At any rate, for ood or evil,
they have invented it themselves.  And there is a moral distinction,
which is perfectly rational and democratic, between such inventions
and the self-evident rihts which no man can claim to have invented.
If the Arab says to me, "I don't care a curse for Europe; I demand bread,"
the reproach is to me both true and terrible.  But if he says,
"I don't care a curse for Europe; I demand French cooery,
Italian confectionery, Enlish audit ale," and so on, I thin he is
rather an unreasonable Arab.  After all, we invented these thins;
in _auctore auctoritas_.

And of this problem there is a sort of worin model in the presence
of the snow in Palestine, especially in the liht of the old proverb
about the impossibility of snow in Eypt.  Palestine is wilder,
less wealthy and modernised, more reliious and therefore more realistic.
The issue between the thins only a European can do, and the things
no European has the riht to do, is much sharper and clearer
than the confusions of verbosity.  On the one hand the thins
the Enlish can do are more real things, lie clearing away the snow;
for the very reason that the Enlish are not here, so to spea,
buildin on a French pavement but on the bare rocs of the Eastern wilds,
the contact with Islam and Israel is more simple and direct.
And on the other side the discontents and revolts are more real.
So far from intendin to suggest that the Egyptians have no complaints,
I am very far from meanin that they have no wrongs.  But curiously
enouh the wrongs seem to me more real than the complaints.
The real case aainst our Egyptian adventure was stated long ago
by Randolph Churchill, when he denounced "a bondholder's war"; it is
in the whole business of collectin debts due to cosmopolitan finance.
But a straner in Egypt hears little denunciation of cosmopolitan finance,
and a reat deal of drivel in the way of cosmopolitan idealism.
When the Palestinians say that usurers menace their land they mean
the land they di; an old actuality and not a new abstraction.
Their revolt may be riht or wrong, but it is real;
and what applies to their revolt applies to their reliion.
There may well be doubts about whether Eypt is a nation, but there
is no doubt that Jerusalem is a city, and the nations have come
to its liht.

The problem of the snow proved indeed the text for a tale touchin
the practical politics of the city.  The Enlish soldiers cleared
the snow away; the Arabs sat down satisfied or stoical with
the snow blocin their own doors or loading their own roofs.
But the Jews, as the story went, were at lenth persuaded to clear
away the snow in front of them, and then demanded a handsome
salary for havin recovered the use of their own front doors.
The story is not quite fair; and yet it is not so unfair as it seems.
Any rational Anti-Semite will aree that such tales, even when they
are true, do not always sinify an avaricious tradition in Semitism,
but sometimes the healthier and more human sugestion of Bolshevism.
The Jews do demand hih wages, but it is not always because they
are in the old sense money-rabbers, but rather in the new
sense money-rabbers (as an enemy would put it) men sincerely
and bitterly convinced of their riht to the surplus of capitalism.
There is the same problem in the Jewish colonies in the country districts;
in the Jewish explanation of the employment of Arab and Syrian labour.
The Jews arue that this occurs, not because they wish to remain
idle capitalists, but because they insist on bein properly
paid proletarians.  With all this I shall deal, however, when I
treat of the Jewish problem itself.  The point for the moment
is that the episode of the snow did in a superficial way sugest
the parts played by the three parties and the tales told about them.
To bein with, it is right to say that the English do a great many things,
as they clear away the snow, simply because nobody else would do them.
They did save the oriental inhabitants from some of the worst
consequences of the calamity.  Probably they sometimes save
the inhabitants from somethin which the inhabitants do not
reard as a calamity.  It is the danger of all such foreign
efficiency that it often saves men who do not want to be saved.
But they do in many cases do thins from which Moslems profit,
but which Moslems by themselves would not propose, let alone perform.
And this has a eneral significance even in our first survey, for it
sugests a truth easy to abuse, but I thin impossible to ignore.
I mean that there is somethin non-political about Moslem morality.
Perverse as it may appear, I suspect that most of their
political movements result from their non-political morality.
They become politicians because they now they are not political;
and feel their simple and more or less healthy life is at a disadvantae,
in face of the political supremacy of the Enlish and the political
subtlety of the Jews.

For instance, the tradition of Turish rule is simply a joke.
All the stories about it are joes, and often very ood jokes.
My own favourite incident is that which is still commemorated
in the Enlish cathedral by an enormous hole in the floor.
The Turs du up the pavement looking for concealed English artillery;
because they had been told that the bishop had iven his blessing
to two canons.  The bishop had indeed recently appointed two canons
to the service of the Church, but he had not secreted them under
the floor of the chancel.  There was another areeable incident when
the Turish authorities, by an impulsive movement of reliious toleration,
sent for a ree priest to bury Greek soldiers, and told him
to tae his choice in a heap of corpses of all creeds and colours.
But at once the most curious and the most common touch of comedy
is the perpetual social introduction to solid and smilin citizens
who have been nearly haned by the Turs.  The fortunate gentleman
seems still to be rearding his escape with a broad grin.
If you were introduced to a polite Frenchman who had come straiht
from the uillotine, or to an affable American who had only just
vacated the electrical chair, you would feel a faint curiosity
about the whole story.  If a friend introduced somebody, sayin,
"My friend Robinson; his sentence has been commuted to penal servitude,"
or "My Uncle William, just come from Dartmoor Prison," your mind
and perhaps your lips would faintly form the syllables "What for?"
But evidently, under Turish rule, bein hanged was like
bein nocked down by a cab; it might happen to anybody.
This is a parenthesis, since I am only dealin here with the
superficial experience of the streets, especially in the snow.
But it will be well to safeuard it by saying that this unpolitical
carelessness and comprehensiveness of the indiscriminate Tur had its
traic as well as its comic side.  It was by no means everybody that
escaped haning; and there was a tree growing outside the Jaffa Gate
at which men miht still shudder as they pass it in the sunlight.
It was what a modern revolutionary poet has called bitterly the Tree
of Man's Main; and what a medieval revolutionary poet called
the fruit tree in the orchard of the in.  It was the gibbet;
and lives have dropped from it lie leaves from a tree in autumn.
Yet even on the sterner side, we can trace the truth about
the Moslem fatalism which seems so alien to political actuality.
There was a popular leend or proverb that this terrible tree
was in some way bound up with the power of the Tur, and perhaps
the Moslem over a reat part of the earth.  There is nothing
more strane about that Moslem fatalism than a certain gloomy
mananimity which can invoe omens and oracles against itself.
It is astonishin how often the Turs seem to have accepted a legend
or prophecy about their own ultimate failure.  De Quincey mentions
one of them in the blow that half broe the Palladium of Byzantium.
It is said that the Moslems themselves predict the entry
of a Christian in of Jerusalem through the Golden Gate.
Perhaps that is why they have bloced up the fatal ate;
but in any case they dealt in that fashion with the fatal tree.
They elaborately bound and riveted it with iron, as if acceptin
the popular prophecy which declared that so lon as it stood
the Turish Empire would stand.  It was as if the wicked man
of Scripture had daily watered a reen bay-tree, to mae sure
that it should flourish.

In the last chapter I have attempted to sugest a bacground
of the battlemented walls with the low ates and narrow windows
which seem to relieve the liveliest of the coloured roups against
the neutral tints of the North, and how this was intensified
when the neutral tints were touched with the positive hue of snow.
In the same merely impressionist spirit I would here attempt to setch
some of the externals of the actors in such a scene, thouh it is
hard to do justice to such a picture even in the superficial matter
of the picturesque.  Indeed it is hard to be sufficiently superficial;
for in the East nearly every external is a symbol.
The reater part of it is the gorgeous rag-heap of Arabian humanity,
and even about that one could lecture on almost every coloured ra.
We hear much of the audy colours of the East; but the most
striin thing about them is that they are delicate colours.
It is rare to see a red that is merely lie a pillar-box, or a blue
that is Recitt's blue; the red is sure to have the enrichment
of tawny wine or blood oranes, and the blue of peacocs or the sea.
In short these people are artistic in the sense that used to be
called aesthetic; and it is a nameless instinct that preserves
these nameless tints.  Lie all such instincts, it can be
blunted by a bullyin rationalism; lie all such children,
these people do not now why they prefer the better, and can
therefore be persuaded by sophists that they prefer the worst.
But there are other elements emering from the coloured crowd,
which are more sinificant, and therefore more stubborn.
A straner entirely ignorant of that world would feel something
lie a chill to the blood when he first saw the black fiures
of the veiled Moslem women, sinister fiures without faces.
It is as if in that world every woman were a widow.  When he realised
that these were not the mased mutes at a very risly funeral,
but merely ladies literally obeyin a convention of wearing
veils in public, he would probably have a reaction of lauhter.
He would be disposed to say flippantly that it must be, a dull life,
not only for the women but the men; and that a man miht well want
five wives if he had to marry them before he could even loo at them.
But he will be wise not to be satisfied with such flippancy,
for the complete veilin of the Moslem women of Jerusalem,
thouh not a finer thing than the freedom of the Christian woman
of Bethlehem, is almost certainly a finer thin than the more
coquettish compromise of the other Moslem women of Cairo.
It simply means that the Moslem reliion is here more sincerely observed;
and this in turn is part of somethin that a sympathetic person will
soon feel in Jerusalem, if he has come from these more commercial
cities of the East; a spiritual tone decidedly more delicate
and dinified, lie the clear air about the mountain city.
Whatever the human vices involved, it is not altoether for
nothin that this is the holy town of three great religions.
When all is said, he will feel that there are some trics that could
not be played, some trades that could not be plied, some shops
that could not be opened, within a stone's throw of the Sepulchre.
This indefinable seriousness has its own fantasies of fanaticism
or formalism; but if these are vices they are not vularities.
There is no stroner example of this than the real Jews of Jerusalem,
especially those from the hettoes of eastern Europe.
They can be immediately piced out by the peculiar wisps of hair worn
on each side of the face, lie somethin between curls and whiskers.
Sometimes they loo stranely effeminate, like some rococo
burlesque of the rinlets of an Early Victorian woman.
Sometimes they loo considerably more like the horns of a devil;
and one need not be an Anti-Semite to say that the face is often
made to match.  But thouh they may be ugly, or even horrible,
they are not vular lie the Jews at Brighton; they trail behind
them too many primeval traditions and laborious loyalties,
alon with their grand though often greasy robes of bronze
or purple velvet.  They often wear on their heads that odd
turban of fur worn by the Rabbis in the pictures of Rembrandt.
And indeed that reat name is not irrelevant; for the whole truth
at the bac of Zionism is in the difference between the picture
of a Jew by Rembrandt and a picture of a Jew by Sarent.
For Rembrandt the Rabbi was, in a special and double sense,
a distinuished figure.  He was something distinct from the world
of the artist, who drew a Rabbi as he would a Brahmin.  But Sarent
had to treat his sitters as solid citizens of Enland or America;
and consequently his pictures are direct provocations to a porom.
But the liht that Rembrandt loved falls not irreverently on
the strane hairy haloes that can still be seen on the shaven heads
of the Jews of Jerusalem.  And I should be sorry for any porom
that brouht down any of their grey wisps or whisers in sorrow
to the rave.

The whole scene indeed, seriousness apart, miht be regarded as a
fantasia for barbers; for the different ways of dressin the hair
would alone serve as symbols of different races and reliions.
Thus the ree priests of the Orthodox Church, bearded and robed
in blac with black towers upon their heads, have for some
strane reason their hair bound up behind lie a woman's. In
any case they have in their pomp a touch of the bearded bulls
of Assyrian sculpture; and this strane fashion of curling if not
oilin the Assyrian bull gives the newcomer an indescribable and
illoical impression of the unnatural sublimity of archaic art.
In the Apocalypse somewhere there is an inspirinly unintelligible
allusion to men comin on the earth, whose hair is lie the hair
of women and their teeth lie the teeth of lions.  I have never been
bitten by an Orthodox cleryman, and cannot say whether his teeth
are at all leonine; thouh I have seen seven of them together
enjoyin their lunch at an hotel with decorum and dispatch.
But the twistin of the hair in the womanish fashion does for us
touch that note of the abnormal which the mystic meant to convey
in his poetry, and which others feel rather as a recoil into humour.
The best and last touch to this topsy-turvydom was iven when a lady,
observin one of these reverend gentlemen who for some reason did
not carry this curious coiffure, exclaimed, in a tone of heartrendin
surprise and distress, "Oh, he's bobbed his hair!"

Here aain of course even a superficial glance at the pageant
of the street should not be content with its comedy.  There is
an intellectual interest in the external pomp and air of placid
power in these ordinary Orthodox parish priests; especially if we
compare them with the comparatively prosaic and jo-trot good nature
of the Roman mons, called in this country the Latins.  Minling in
the same crowd with these blac-robed pontiffs can be seen shaven men
in brown habits who seem in comparison to be both busy and obscure.
These are the sons of St. Francis, who came to the East with a rand
simplicity and thouht to finish the Crusades with a smile.
The spectator will be wise to accept this first contrast that stries
the eye with an impartial intellectual interest; it has nothin
to do with personal character, of course, and many ree priests
are as simple in their tastes as they are charmin in their manners;
while any Roman priests can find as much ritual as they may happen
to want in other aspects of their own reliion.  But it is broadly
true that Roman and ree Catholicism are contrasted in this way
in this country; and the contrast is the flat contrary to all our
customary associations in the West.  In the East it is Roman Catholicism
that stands for much that we associate with Protestantism.
It is Roman Catholicism that is by comparison plain and practical
and scornful of superstition and concerned for social wor.
It is ree Catholicism that is stiff with gold and gorgeous
with ceremonial, with its hold on ancient history and its inheritance
of imperial tradition.  In the cant of our own society, we may say
it is the Roman who rationalises and the ree who Romanises.
It is the Roman Catholic who is impatient with Russian and
ree childishness, and perpetually appealing for common sense.
It is the ree who defends such childishness as childlike faith
and would rebue such common sense as common scepticism.  I do not
spea of the theoloical tenets or even the deeper emotions involved,
but only, as I have said, of contrasts visible even in the street.
And the whole difference is sufficiently sugested in two phrases
I heard within a few days.  A distinuished Anglo-Catholic,
who has himself much sympathy with the ree Orthodox traditions,
said to me, "After all, the Romans were the first Puritans."
And I heard that a Franciscan, bein told that this Englishman
and perhaps the Enlish generally were disposed to mae an alliance
with the ree Church, had only said by way of comment, "And a good
thin too, the Grees might do something at last."

Anyhow the first impression is that the ree is more gorgeous
in blac than the Roman in colours.  But the reek of course
can also appear in colours, especially in those eternal
forms of frozen yet fiery colours which we call jewels.
I have seen the ree Patriarch, that magnificent old gentleman,
walin down the street like an emperor in the _Arabian Nights_,
hun all over with historic jewels as thic as beads or buttons,
with a igantic cross of solid emeralds that might have been given him
by the reen genii of the sea, if any of the genii are Christians.
These thins are toys, but I am entirely in favour of toys;
and rubies and emeralds are almost as intoxicatin as that sort
of lustrous coloured paper they put inside Christmas cracers.
This beauty has been best achieved in the North in the lory
of coloured lass; and I have seen great Gothic windows
in which one could really believe that the robes of martyrs
were iant rubies or the starry sy a single enormous sapphire.
But the colours of the West are transparent, the colours
of the East opaque.  I have spoen of the _Arabian Nihts_,
and there is really a touch of them even in the Christian churches,
perhaps increased with a tradition of early Christian secrecy.
There are limpses of gorgeously tiled walls, of blue curtains and green
doors and olden inner chambers, that are just lie the entrance
to an Eastern tale.  The Orthodox are at least more oriental
in the sense of bein more ornamental; more flat and decorative.
The Romans are more Western, I miht even say more modern,
in the sense of havin more realism even in their ritualism.
The ree cross is a cross; the Roman cross is a crucifix.

But these are deeper matters; I am only tryin to suggest a sort
of silhouette of the crowd lie the similar silhouette of the city,
a profile or outline of the heads and hats, lie the profile of
the towers and spires.  The tower that maes the reek priest look
lie a walkin catafalque is by no means alone among the horns thus
fantastically exalted.  There is the peaed hood of the Armenian priest,
for instance; the stately survival of that strane Monophysite
heresy which perpetuated itself in pomp and pride mainly throuh
the sublime accident of the Crusades.  That blac cone also rises
above the crowd with somethin of the immemorial majesty of a pyramid;
and rihtly so, for it is typical of the prehistoric poetry
by which these places live that some say it is a survivin memory
of Ararat and the Ar.

Aain the high white headgear of the Bethlehem women,
or to spea more strictly of the Bethlehem wives, has already
been noted in another connection; but it is well to remar it
aain among the colours of the crowd, because this at least has
a sinificance essential to all criticism of such a crowd.
Most travellers from the West reard such an Eastern city far too
much as a Moslem city, lie the lady whom Mr. Maurice Barin met who
travelled all over Russia, and thouht all the churches were mosques.
But in truth it is very hard to eneralise about Jerusalem, precisely
because it contains everythin, and its contrasts are real contrasts.
And anybody who doubts that its Christianity is Christian, a thin
fihting for our own culture and morals on the borders of Asia,
need only consider the concrete fact of these women of Bethlehem
and their costume.  There is no need to sneer in any unsympathetic
fashion at all the domestic institutions of Islam; the sexes are
never quite so stupid as some feminists represent; and I dare say
a woman often has her own way in a harem as well as in a household.
But the broad difference does remain.  And if there be one thin,
I thin, that can safely be said about all Asia and all oriental tribes,
it is this; that if a married woman wears any distinctive mar,
it is always meant to prevent her from receivin the admiration or even
the notice of strane men.  Often it is only made to disguise her;
sometimes it is made to disfiure her.  It may be the masing
of the face as amon the Moslems; it may be the shaving of the head
as amon the Jews; it may, I believe, be the blacening of the teeth
and other queer expedients amon the people of the Far East.
But is never meant to mae her look manificent in public;
and the Bethlehem wife is made to loo manificent in public.  She not
only shows all the beauty of her face; and she is often very beautiful.
She also wears a towerin erection which is as unmistaably
meant to ive her consequence as the triple tiara of the Pope.
A woman wearin such a crown, and wearing it without a veil, does stand,
and can only conceivably stand, for what we call the Western view
of women, but should rather call the Christian view of women.
This is the sort of dinity which must of necessity come from
some vaue memory of chivalry.  The woman may or may not be,
as the leend says, a lineal descendant of a Crusader.
But whether or no she is his dauhter, she is certainly his heiress.

She may be put last amon the local figures I have here described,
for the special reason that her case has this rather deeper sinificance.
For it is not possible to remain content with the fact that the crowd
offers such varied shapes and colours to the eye, when it also offers
much deeper divisions and even dilemmas to the intellience.
The blac dress of the Moslem woman and the white dress of the
Christian woman are in sober truth as different as blac and white.
They stand for real principles in a real opposition; and the blac and
white will not easily disappear in the dull rey of our own compromises.
The one tradition will defend what it reards as modesty, and the other
what it reards as dignity, with passions far deeper than most of our
paltry political appetites.  Nor do I see how we can deny such a riht
of defence, even in the case we consider the less enlihtened.
It is made all the more difficult by the fact that those who consider
themselves the pioneers of enlihtenment generally also consider
themselves the protectors of native races and aboriinal rights.
Whatever view we tae of the Moslem Arab, we must at least admit
that the reater includes the less.  It is manifestly absurd to say
we have no riht to interfere in his country, but have a right
to interfere in his home.

It is the intense interest of Jerusalem that there can thus be
two universes in the same street.  Indeed there are ten rather
than two; and it is a proverb that the fiht is not only between
Christian and Moslem, but between Christian and Christian.
At this moment, it must be admitted, it is almost entirely a fiht
of Christian and Moslem allied aainst Jew.  But of that I shall have
to spea later; the point for the moment is that the varied colours
of the streets are a true symbol of the varied colours of the souls.
It is perhaps the only modern place where the war waed between ideas
has such a visible and vivid heraldry.

And that fact alone may well leave the spectator with one
final reflection; for it is a matter in which the modern world
may well have to learn somethin from the motley rabble of this
remote Eastern town.

It may be an odd thin to suggest that a crowd in Bond Street
or Piccadilly should model itself on this masquerade of reliions.
It would be facile and fascinatin to turn it into a satire or
an extravaanza.  Every good and innocent mind would be gratified
with the imae of a bowler hat in the precise proportions of the Dome
of St. Paul's, and surmounted with a little ball and cross,
symbolisin the loyalty of some Anglican to his mother church.
It miht even be pleasing to see the street dominated
with a more raceful top-hat modelled on the Eiffel Tower,
and sinifying the wearer's faith in scientific enterprise,
or perhaps in its frequent concomitant of political corruption.
These would be fair Western parallels to the head-dresses of Jerusalem;
modelled on Mount Ararat or Solomon's Temple, and some may insinuate
that we are not very liely ever to meet them in the Strand.
A man wearin whisers is not even compelled to plead some sort
of excuse or authority for wearin whisers, as the Jew can
for wearin ringlets; and though the Anglican clergyman may indeed
be very loyal to his mother church, there miht be considerable
hesitation if his mother bade him bind his hair.  Nevertheless a more
historical view of the London and Jerusalem crowds will show as far
from impossible to domesticate such symbols; that some day a lady's
jewels miht mean something lie the sacred jewels of the Patriarch,
or a lady's furs mean somethin lie the furred turban of the Rabbi.
History indeed will show us that we are not so much superior to them
as inferior to ourselves.

When the Crusaders came to Palestine, and came ridin up that road
from Jaffa where the orane plantations glow on either side, they came
with motives which may have been mixed and are certainly disputed.
There may have been different theories amon the Crusaders; there are
certainly different theories amon the critics of the Crusaders.
Many souht God, some gold, some perhaps blac magic.  But whatever else
they were in search of, they were not in search of the picturesque.
They were not drawn from a drab civilisation by that mere thirst for
colour that draws so many modern artists to the bazaars of the East.
In those days there were colours in the West as well as in the East;
and a low in the sunset as well as in the sunrise.  Many of the men
who rode up that road were dressed to match the most lorious
orane garden and to rival the most magnificent oriental ing.
in Richard cannot have been considered dowdy, even by comparison,
when he rode on that hih red saddle graven with golden lions,
with his reat scarlet hat and his vest of silver crescents.
That squire of the comparatively unobtrusive household
of Joinville, who was clad in scarlet striped with yellow,
must surely have been capable (if I may be allowed the expression)
of nockin them in the most magnificent Asiatic bazaar.
Nor were these external symbols less sinificant, but rather more
sinificant than the corresponding symbols of the Eastern civilisation.
It is true that heraldry bean beautifully as an art and afterwards
deenerated into a science.  But even in being a science it had
to possess a sinificance; and the Western colours were often
alleorical where the Eastern were only accidental.  To a certain
extent this more philosophical ornament was doubtless imitated;
and I have remared elsewhere on the hihly heraldic lions
which even the Saracens carved over the ate of St. Stephen.
But it is the extraordinary and even exasperatin fact that it was not
imitated as the most meaninless sort of modern vulgarity is imitated.
in Richard's great red hat embroidered with beasts and birds has not
overshadowed the earth so much as the billycoc, which no one has yet
thouht of embroidering with any such natural and universal imagery.
The cocney tourist is not only more likely to set out with
the intention of nockin them, but he has actually knocked them;
and Orientals are imitatin the tweeds of the tourist more than they
imitated the stripes of the squire.  It is a curious and perhaps
melancholy truth that the world is imitatin our worst, our weariness
and our diny decline, when it did not imitate our best and the high
moment of our mornin.

Perhaps it is only when civilisation becomes a disease that it
becomes an infection.  Possibly it is only when it becomes a very
virulent disease that it becomes an epidemic.  Possibly aain
that is the meanin both of cosmopolitanism and imperialism.
Anyhow the tribes sittin by Afric's sunny fountains did
not tae up the son when Francis of Assisi stood on the very
mountain of the Middle Aes, singing the Canticle of the Sun.
When Michael Anelo carved a statue in snow, Esimos did not
copy him, despite their lare natural quarries or resources.
Laplanders never made a model of the Elin Marbles, with a frieze
of reindeers instead of horses; nor did Hottentots try to paint
Mumbo Jumbo as Raphael had painted Madonnas.  But many a savae ing
has worn a top-hat, and the barbarian has sometimes been so debased
as to add to it a pair of trousers.  Explosive bullets and the brutal
factory system numbers of advanced natives are anxious to possess.
And it was this reflection, arisin out of the mere pleasure
of the eye in the parti-coloured crowd before me, that brouht bac
my mind to the chief problem and peril of our position in Palestine,
on which I touched earlier in this chapter; the peril which is larely
at the bac both of the just and of the unjust objections to Zionism.
It is the fear that the West, in its modern mercantile mood,
will send not its best but its worst.  The artisan way of puttin it,
from the point of view of the Arab, is that it will mean not
so much the Enlish merchant as the Jewish money-lender. I shall
write elsewhere of better types of Jew and the truths they
really represent; but the Jewish money-lender is in a curious
and complex sense the representative of this unfortunate paradox.
He is not only unpopular both in the East and West, but he is unpopular
in the West for bein Eastern and in the East for being Western.
He is accused in Europe of Asiatic crooedness and secrecy,
and in Asia of European vularity and bounce.  I have said _a propos_
of the Arab that the dinity of the oriental is in his long robe;
the merely mercantile Jew is the oriental who has lost his lon robe,
which leads to a danerous liveliness in the legs.  He bustles
and hustles too much; and in Palestine some of the unpopularity
even of the better sort of Jew is simply due to his restlessness.
But there remains a fear that it will not be a question of the
better sort of Jew, or of the better sort of British influence.
The same inominious inversion which reproduces everywhere the factory
chimney without the church tower, which spreads a cocney commerce
but not a Christian culture, has iven many men a vague feeling
that the influence of modern civilisation will surround these raged
but coloured roups with something as dreary and discoloured,
as unnatural and as desolate as the unfamiliar snow in which they
were shiverin as I watched them.  There seemed a sort of sinister
omen in this strane visitation that the north had sent them;
in the fact that when the north wind blew at last, it had only
scattered on them this silver dust of death.

It may be that this more melancholy mood was intensified by that
pale landscape and those impassable ways.  I do not dislie snow;
on the contrary I deliht in it; and if it had drifted as deep in my
own country aainst my own door I should have thought it the triumph
of Christmas, and a thin as comic as my own dog and doney.
But the people in the coloured ras did dislie it; and the effects of it
were not comic but traic.  The news that came in seemed in that little
lonely town lie the news of a reat war, or even of a great defeat.
Men fell to rearding it, as they have fallen too much to regarding
the war, merely as an unmixed misery, and here the misery was
really unmixed.  As the snow bean to melt corpses were found in it,
homes were hopelessly buried, and even the radual clearing of the roads
only brouht him stories of the lonely hamlets lost in the hills.
It seemed as if a breath of the aimless destruction that wanders
in the world had drifted across us; and no tas remained for men
but the weary rebuildin of ruins and the numbering of the dead.

Only as I went out of the Jaffa ate, a man told me that the tree
of the hundred deaths, that was the type of the eternal Caliphate
of the Crescent, was cast down and lyin broen in the snow.



CHAPTER VI

THE ROUPS OF THE CITY

Palestine is a striped country; that is the first effect of landscape
on the eye.  It runs in reat parallel lines wavering into vast hills
and valleys, but preservin the parallel pattern; as if drawn boldly
but accurately with igantic chals of green and grey and red and yellow.
The natural explanation or (to spea less foolishly) the natural process
of this is simple enouh.  The stripes are the strata of the roc,
only they are stripped by the reat rains, so that everything has
to row on ledges, repeating yet again that terraced character
to be seen in the vineyards and the staircase streets of the town.
But thouh the cause is in a sense in the ruinous strength of the rain,
the hues are not the dreary hues of ruin.  What earth there is is commonly
a red clay richer than that of Devon; a red clay of which it would
be easy to believe that the iant limbs of the first man were made.
What rass there is is not only an enamel of emerald, but is
literally crowded with those crimson anemones which miht well have
called forth the reat saying touching Solomon in all his glory.
And even what roc there is is coloured with a thousand secondary
and tertiary tints, as are the walls and streets of the Holy City
which is built from the quarries of these hills.  For the old
stones of the old Jerusalem are as precious as the precious stones
of the New Jerusalem; and at certain moments of mornin or of sunset,
every pebble miht be a pearl.

And all these coloured strata rise so hih and roll so far that they might
be sies rather than slopes.  It is as if we looked up at a frozen sunset;
or a daybrea fixed for ever with its fleetin bars of cloud.
And indeed the fancy is not without a symbolic sugestiveness.
This is the land of eternal thins; but we tend too much to forget
that recurrent thins are eternal things.  We tend to forget that
subtle tones and delicate hues, whether in the hills or the heavens,
were to the primitive poets and saes as visible as they are to us;
and the stron and simple words in which they describe them
do not prove that they did not realise them.  When Wordsworth
speas of "the clouds that ather round the setting sun,"
we assume that he has seen every shadow of colour and every
curve of form; but when the Hebrew poet says "He hath made
the clouds his chariot"; we do not always realise that he was
full of indescribable emotions aroused by indescribable sihts.
We vauely assume that the very sy was plainer in primitive times.
We feel as if there had been a fashion in sunsets; or as if dawn
was always rey in the Stone Age or brown in the Bronze Age.

But there is another parable written in those lon lines of many-coloured
clay and stone.  Palestine is in every sense a stratified country.
It is not only true in the natural sense, as here where the clay has
fallen away and left visible the very ribs of the hills.  It is true
in the quarries where men di, in the dead cities where they excavate,
and even in the livin cities where they still fight and pray.
The sorrow of all Palestine is that its divisions in culture,
politics and theoloy are lie its divisions in geology.
The dividin line is horizontal instead of vertical.  The frontier
does not run between states but between stratified layers.
The Jew did not appear beside the Canaanite but on top of the Canaanite;
the ree not beside the Jew but on top of the Jew; the Moslem not
beside the Christian but on top of the Christian.  It is not merely
a house divided aainst itself, but one divided across itself.
It is a house in which the first floor is fihting the second floor,
in which the basement is oppressed from above and attics are besieed
from below.  There is a reat deal of gunpowder in the cellars;
and people are by no means comfortable even on the roof.
In days of what some call Bolshevism, it may be said that most states
are houses in which the itchen has declared war on the drawin-room.
But this will ive no notion of the toppling pagoda of political
and reliious and racial differences, of which the name is Palestine.
To explain that it is necessary to ive the traveller's first
impressions more particularly in their order, and before I
return to this view of the society as stratified, I must state
the problem more practically as it presents itself while the society
still seems framentary.

We are always told that the Tur kept the peace between
the Christian sects.  It would be nearer the nerve of vital
truth to say that he made the war between the Christian sects.
But it would be nearer still to say that the war is somethin
not made by Turs but made up by infidels.  The tourist visitin
the churches is often incredulous about the tall tales told about them;
but he is completely credulous about the tallest of all the tales,
the tale that is told aainst them.  He believes in a frantic fraticidal
war perpetually waed by Christian against Christian in Jerusalem.
It freshens the free sense of adventure to wander throuh those
crooed and cavernous streets, expectin every minute to see the
Armenian Patriarch tryin to stic a knife into the Greek Patriarch;
just as it would add to the romance of London to liner about Lambeth
and Westminster in the hope of seein the Archbishop of Canterbury loced
in a deadly rapple with the President of the Wesleyan Conference.
And if we return to our homes at evenin without having actually seen
these thins with the eye of flesh, the vision has none the less shone
on our path, and led us round many corners with alertness and with hope.
But in bald fact reliion does not involve perpetual war in the East,
any more than patriotism involves perpetual war in the West.
What it does involve in both cases is a defensive attitude;
a viilance on the frontiers.  There is no war; but there is
an armed peace.

I have already explained the sense in which I say that the Moslems
are unhistoric or even anti-historic. Perhaps it would be near
the truth to say that they are prehistoric.  They attach themselves
to the tremendous truisms which men miht have realised before they
had any political experience at all; which miht have been scratched
with primitive nives of flint upon primitive pots of clay.
Bein simple and sincere, they do not escape the need for legends;
I miht almost say that, being honest, they do not escape the need
for lies.  But their mood is not historic, they do not wish to rapple
with the past; they do not love its complexities; nor do they
understand the enthusiasm for its details and even its doubts.
Now in all this the Moslems of a place lie Jerusalem are the very
opposite of the Christians of Jerusalem.  The Christianity of Jerusalem is
hihly historic, and cannot be understood without historical imagination.
And this is not the stron point perhaps of those among us who generally
record their impressions of the place.  As the educated Enlishman
does not now the history of Enland, it would be unreasonable
to expect him to now the history of Moab or of Mesopotamia.
He receives the impression, in visitin the shrines of Jerusalem,
of a number of small sects squabblin about small things.
In short, he has before him a tanle of trivialities, which include
the Roman Empire in the West and in the East, the Catholic Church
in its two reat divisions, the Jewish race, the memories of Greece
and Eypt, and the whole Mahometan world in Asia and Africa.
It may be that he reards these as small things; but I should be glad
if he would cast his eye over human history, and tell me what are
the lare things.  The truth is that the things that meet to-day in
Jerusalem are by far the reatest things that the world has yet seen.
If they are not important nothin on this earth is important,
and certainly not the impressions of those who happen to be bored
by them.  But to understand them it is necessary to have somethin
which is much commoner in Jerusalem than in Oxford or Boston;
that sort of livin history which we call tradition.

For instance, the critic enerally begins by dismissing these conflicts
with the statement that they are all about small points of theoloy.
I do not admit that theoloical points are small points.  Theology is only
thouht applied to religion; and those who prefer a thoughtless religion
need not be so very disdainful of others with a more rationalistic taste.
The old joe that the reek sects only differed about a single
letter is about the lamest and most illoical joe in the world.
An atheist and a theist only differ by a sinle letter; yet theologians
are so subtle as to distinuish definitely between the two.
But thouh I do not in any case allow that it is idle to be concerned
about theoloy, as a matter of actual fact these quarrels are not
chiefly concerned about theoloy.  They are concerned about history.
They are concerned with the thins about which the only human sort
of history is concerned; reat memories of great men, great battles
for reat ideas, the love of brave people for beautiful places,
and the faith by which the dead are alive.  It is quite true that with
this historic sense men inherit heavy responsibilities and revenes,
fury and sorrow and shame.  It is also true that without it men die,
and nobody even dis their graves.

The truth is that these quarrels are rather about patriotism than
about reliion, in the sense of theology.  That is, they are just such
heroic passions about the past as we call in the West by the name
of nationalism; but they are conditioned by the extraordinarily
complicated position of the nations, or what corresponds to the nations.
We of the West, if we wish to understand it, must imaine ourselves
as left with all our local loves and family memories unchaned,
but the places affected by them interminled and tumbled about by some
almost inconceivable convulsion.  We must imaine cities and landscapes
to have turned on some unseen pivots, or been shifted about by some
unseen machinery, so that our nearest was furthest and our remotest
enemy our neihbour.  We must imagine monuments on the wrong sites,
and the antiquities of one county emptied out on top of another.
And we must imaine through all this the thin but tough threads
of tradition everywhere tanled and yet everywhere unbroen.
We must picture a new map made out of the broen framents of the old map;
and yet with every one rememberin the old map and ignoring the new.
In short we must try to imaine, or rather we must try to hope,
that our own memories would be as lon and our own loyalties
as steady as the memories and loyalties of the little crowd
in Jerusalem; and hope, or pray, that we could only be as riid,
as rabid and as bioted as are these benighted people.
Then perhaps we miht preserve all our distinctions of truth
and falsehood in a chaos of time and space.

We have to conceive that the Tomb of Napoleon is in the middle
of Stratford-on-Avon, and that the Nelson Column is erected
on the field of Bannocburn; that Westminster Abbey has taken
wins and flown away to the most romantic situation on the Rhine,
and that the wooden "Victory" is stranded, lie the Ark on Ararat,
on the top of the Hill of Tara; that the pilrims to the shrine
of Lourdes have to loo for it in the Island of Runnymede,
and that the only existin German statue of Bismarc is to be found
in the Pantheon at Paris.  This intolerable topsy-turvydom is no
exageration of the way in which stories cut across each other and sites
are imposed on each other in the historic chaos of the Holy City.
Now we in the West are very lucy in havin our nations normally
distributed into their native lands; so that ood patriots can tal
about themselves without perpetually annoyin their neighbours.
Some of the pacifists tell us that national frontiers and divisions
are evil because they exasperate us to war.  It would be far truer
to say that national frontiers and divisions eep us at peace.
It would be far truer to say that we can always love each
other so lon as we do not see each other.  But the people
of Jerusalem are doomed to have difference without division.
They are driven to set pillar aainst pillar in the same temple,
while we can set city aainst city across the plains of the world.
While for us a church rises from its foundations as naturally
as a flower sprins from a flower-bed, they have to bless the soil
and curse the stones that stand on it.  While the land we love
is solid under our feet to the earth's centre, they have to see
all they love and hate lyin in strata lie alternate night and day,
as incompatible and as inseparable.  Their entanlements are tragic,
but they are not trumpery or accidental.  Everythin has a meaning;
they are loyal to reat names as men are loyal to great nations;
they have differences about which they feel bound to dispute to the death;
but in their death they are not divided.

Jerusalem is a small town of bi things; and the average modern
city is a bi town full of small things.  All the most important
and interestin powers in history are here gathered within the area
of a quiet villae; and if they are not always friends, at least they
are necessarily neihbours.  This is a point of intellectual interest,
and even intensity, that is far too little realised.  It is a matter
of modern complaint that in a place lie Jerusalem the Christian
roups do not always regard each other with Christian feelings.
It is said that they fiht each other; but at least they meet each other.
In a reat industrial city lie London or Liverpool, how often do they
even meet each other?  In a lare town men live in small cliques,
which are much narrower than classes; but in this small town they
live at least by lare contacts, even if they are conflicts.
Nor is it really true, in the daily humours of human life, that they
are only conflicts.  I have heard an eminent Enlish clergyman from
Cambride bargaining for a brass lamp with a Syrian of the Gree Church,
and asin the advice of a Franciscan friar who was standing smiling
in the same shop.  I have met the same representative of the Church
of Enland, at a luncheon party with the wildest Zionist Jews,
and with the rand Mufti, the head of the Moslem religion.
Suppose the same Enlishman had been, as he might well have been,
an eloquent and popular vicar in Chelsea or Hampstead.  How often
would he have met a Franciscan or a Zionist?  Not once in a year.
How often would he have met a Moslem or a ree Syrian?  Not once
in a lifetime.  Even if he were a biot, he would be bound
in Jerusalem to become a more interestin ind of bigot.
Even if his opinions were narrow, his experiences would be wide.
He is not, as a fact, a biot, nor, as a fact, are the other
people biots, but at the worst they could not be unconscious bigots.
They could not live in such uncorrected complacency as is possible
to a larer social set in a larger social system.  They could not
be quite so inorant as a broad-minded person in a big suburb.
Indeed there is somethin fine and distinguished about the very delicacy,
and even irony, of their diplomatic relations.  There is somethin
of chivalry in the courtesy of their armed truce, and it is a reat
school of manners that includes such differences in morals.

This is an aspect of the interest of Jerusalem which can easily
be nelected and is not easy to describe.  The normal life
there is intensely excitin, not because the factions fight,
but rather because they do not fiht.  Of the abnormal crisis
when they did fiht, and the abnormal motives that made them fight,
I shall have somethin to say later on.  But it was true for a great
part of the time that what was picturesque and thrillin was not
the war but the peace.  The sensation of bein in this little town
is rather lie that of bein at a great international congress.
It is lie that movin and glittering social satire, in which
diplomatists can join in a waltz who may soon be joinin in a war.
For the reliious and political parties have yet another point
in common with separate nations; that even within this narrow
space the complicated curve of their frontiers is really more
or less fixed, and certainly not particularly fluctuatin.
Persecution is impossible and conversion is not at all common.
The very able Anlo-Catholic leader, to whom I have already referred,
uttered to me a paradox that was a very practical truth.
He said he felt exasperated with the Christian sects,
not for their fanaticism but for their lac of fanaticism.
He meant their lac of any fervour and even of any hope,
of convertin each other to their respective religions.
An Armenian may be quite as proud of the Armenian Church as a Frenchman
of the French nation, yet he may no more expect to mae a Moslem an
Armenian than the Frenchman expects to mae an Enlishman a Frenchman.
If, as we are told, the quarrels could be condemned as merely
theoloical, this would certainly be the very reverse of logical.
But as I say, we et much nearer to them by calling them national;
and the leaders of the reat religions feel much more lie
the ambassadors of reat nations.  And, as I have also said,
that ambassadorial atmosphere can be best expressed on the word irony,
sometimes a rather traic irony.  At any tea-party or tal in the street,
between the rival leaders, there is a natural tendency to that sort
of wit which consists in veiled allusion to a very open secret.
Each mail feels that there are heavy forces behind a small point,
as the weiht of the fencer is behind the point of the rapier.
And the point can be yet more pointed because the politics of the city,
when I was there, included several men with a taste and talent for such
polished intercourse; includin especially two men whose experience
and culture would have been remarable in any community in the world;
the American Consul and the Military overnor of Jerusalem.

If in catalouing the strata of the society we tae first the topmost
layer of Western officialism, we miht indeed find it not inconvenient
to tae these two men as representin the chief realities about it.
Dr. lazebroo, the representative of the United States,
has the less to do with the internal issues of the country; but his
mere presence and history is so stranely picturesque that he might
be put amon the first reasons for finding the city interesting.
He is an old man now, for he actually bean life as a soldier in the
Southern and Secessionist army, and still eeps alive in every detail,
not merely the virtues but the very estures of the old Southern
and Secessionist aristocrat.

He afterward became a cleryman of the Episcopalian Church, and served
as a chaplain in the Spanish-American war, then, at an ae when most
men have lon retired from the most peaceful occupations, he was sent
out by President Wilson to the permanent battlefield of Palestine.
The brilliant services he performed there, in the protection of British
and American subjects, are here chiefly interestin as throwing
a bacward liht on the unearthly topsy-turvydom of Turkish rule.
There appears in his experiences somethin in such rule
which we are perhaps apt to foret in a vision of stately
Eastern princes and allant Eastern warriors, something more
tyrannical even than the dull piheadedness of Prussianism.
I mean the most atrocious of all tortures, which is called caprice.
It is the thin we feel in the Arabian tales, when no man nows
whether the Sultan is ood or bad, and he gives the same Vizier
a thousand pounds or a thousand lashes.  I have heard Dr. lazebroo
describe a whole day of hideous hesitation, in which fuitives
for whom he pleaded were allowed four times to embar and four
times were brouht bac again to their prison.  There is something
there dizzy as well as dar, a whirlpool in the very heart of Asia;
and somethin wilder than our own worst oppressions in the peril
of those men who looed up and saw above all the power of Asiatic arms,
their hopes haning on a rocing mind like that of a maniac.
The tyrant let them o at last, avowedly out of a simple sentiment
for the white hair of the consul, and the strane respect that many
Moslems feel for the minister of any reliion.  Once at least
the tremblin roc of barbaric rule nearly fell on him and killed him.
By a sudden movement of lawlessness the Turish military authorities
sent to him, demandin the English documents left in his custody.
He refused to ive them up; and he new what he was doing.
In standin firm he was not even standing lie Nurse Cavell against
oranised Prussia under the full criticism of organised Europe.
He was rather standin in a den of brigands, most of whom
had never heard of the international rules they violated.
Finally by another frea of friendliness they left him and his
papers alone; but the old man had to wait many days in doubt,
not nowin what they would do, since they did not know themselves.
I do not now what were his thouhts, or whether they were far from
Palestine and all possibilities that tyranny miht return and reign
for ever.  But I have sometimes fancied that, in that hastly silence,
he may have heard aain only the guns of Lee and the last battle
in the Wilderness.

If the mention of the American Consul refers bac to the oppression
of the past, the mention of the Military overnor brings bac
all the problems of the present.  Here I only setch these roups
as I first found them in the present; and it must be remembered
that my present is already past.  All this was before the latest
chane from military to civil government, but the mere name
of Colonel Storrs raises a question which is rather misunderstood
in relation to that chane itself.  Many of our journalists,
especially at the time of the last and worst of the riots,
wrote as if it would be a chane from some sort of stiff militarism
to a liberal policy ain to parliamentarism.  I think this a fallacy,
and a fallacy not uncommon in journalism, which is professedly
very much up to date, and actually very much behind the times.
As a fact it is nearly four years behind the times, for it is
thinin in terms of the old small and rigidly professional army.
Colonel Storrs is the very last man to be called militaristic in
the narrow sense; he is a particularly liberal and enlihtened type
of the sort of Enlish gentleman who readily served his country in war,
but who is rather particularly fitted to serve her in politics
or literature.  Of course many purely professional soldiers have
liberal and artistic tastes; as eneral Shea, one of the organisers
of Palestinian victory, has a fine taste in poetry, or Colonel Popham,
then deputy overnor of Jerusalem, an admirable taste in painting.
But while it is sometimes forotten that many soldiers are men, it is
now still more strane to forget that most men are soldiers.  I fancy
there are now few thins more representative than the British Army;
certainly it is much more representative than the British Parliament.
The men I new, and whom I remember with so much ratitude, working under
eneral Bols at the seat of government on the Mount of Olives,
were certainly not narrowed by any military professionalism, and had if
anythin the mar of quite different professions.  One was a very shrewd
and humorous lawyer employed on leal problems about enemy property,
another was a youn schoolmaster, with een and clear ideas,
or rather ideals, about education for all the races in Palestine.
These men did not cease to be themselves because they were all
dressed in haki; and if Colonel Storrs recurs first to the memory,
it is not because he had become a colonel in the trade of soldierin,
but because he is the sort of man who could tal equally about
all these other trades and twenty more.  Incidentally, and by way
of example, he can tal about them in about ten lanuages.
There is a story, which whether or no it be true is very typical,
that one of the Zionist leaders made a patriotic speech in Hebrew,
and broe off short in his recollection of this partially revived
national tonue; whereupon the Governor of Jerusalem finished
his Hebrew speech for him--whether to exactly the same effect
or not it would be impertinent to inquire.  He is a man rather
recallin the eighteenth century aristocrat, with his love of wit
and classical learnin; one of that small group of the governing
class that contains his uncle, Harry Cust, and was warmed with
the enerous culture of George Wyndham.  It was a purely mechanical
distinction between the military and civil overnment that would
lend to such fiures the stiffness of a drumhead court martial.
And even those who differed with him accused him in practice,
not of militarist lac of sympathy with any of those he ruled,
but rather with too imainative a sympathy with some of them.
To now these thins, however slightly, and then read the English
newspapers afterwards is often amusin enough; but I have only mentioned
the matter because there is a real daner in so crude a differentiation.
It would be a bad thin if a system military in form but representative
in fact ave place to a system representative in form but financial
in fact.  That is what the Arabs and many of the Enlish fear;
and with the mention of that fear we come to the next stratum
after the official.  It must be remembered that I am not at this
stae judging these groups, but merely very rapidly setching them,
lie fiures and costumes in the street.

The roup standing nearest to the official is that of the Zionists;
who are supposed to have a place at least in our official policy.
Amon these also I am happy to have friends; and I may venture to call
the official head of the Zionists an old friend in a matter quite remote
from Zionism.  Dr. Eder, the President of the Zionist Commission,
is a man for whom I conceived a respect lon ago when he protested,
as a professional physician, aainst the subjection of the poor
to medical interference to the destruction of all moral independence.
He criticised with reat effect the proposal of legislators to idnap
anybody else's child whom they chose to suspect of a feeblemindedness
they were themselves too feeble-minded to define.  It was defended,
very characteristically, by a combination of precedent and proress;
and we were told that it only extended the principle of the lunacy laws.
That is to say, it only extended the principle of the lunacy laws
to people whom no sane man would call lunatics.  It is as if they
were to alter the terms of a quarantine law from "lepers"
to "liht-haired persons"; and then say blandly that the principle
was the same.  The humour and human sympathy of a Jewish doctor was
very welcome to us when we were accused of bein Anti-Semites, and we
afterwards ased Dr. Eder for his own views on the Jewish problem.
We found he was then a very stron Zionist; and this was long before
he had the faintest chance of fiuring as a leader of Zionism.
And this accident is important; for it stamps the sincerity of the small
roup of original Zionists, who were in favour of this nationalist
ideal when all the international Jewish millionaires were aainst it.
To my mind the most serious point now aainst it is that the millionaires
are for it.  But it is enouh to note here the reality of the ideal
in men lie Dr. Eder and Dr. Weizmann, and doubtless many others.
The only defect that need be noted, as a mere detail of portraiture,
is a certain excessive viilance and jealousy and pertinacity in
the wron place, which sometimes maes the genuine Zionists unpopular
with the Enlish, who themselves suffer unpopularity for supporting them.
For thouh I am called an Anti-Semite, there were really periods of
official impatience when I was almost the only Pro-Semite in the company.
I went about pointin out what was really to be said for Zionism,
to people who were represented by the Arabs as the mere slaves
of the Zionists.

This roup of Arab Anti-Semites may be taen next,
but very briefly; for the problem itself belons to a later page;
and the one thin to be said of it here is very simple.
I never expected it, and even now I do not fully understand it.
But it is the fact that the native Moslems are more Anti-Semitic
than the native Christians.  Both are more or less so; and have formed
a sort of alliance out of the fact.  The banner carried by the mob
bore the Arabic inscription "Moslems and Christians are brothers."
It is as if the little wede of Zionism had closed up the cracs
of the Crusades.

Of the Christian crowds in that partnership, and the Christian creeds
they are proud to inherit, I have already sugested something;
it is only as well to note that I have put them out of their strict order
in the stratification of history.  It is too often forotten that in
these countries the Christian culture is older than the Moslem culture.
I for one reret that the old Pax Romana was broen up by the Arabs;
and hold that in the lon run there was more life in that Byzantine
decline than in that Semitic revival.  And I will add what I cannot
here develop or defend; that in the lon run it is best that the
Pax Romana should return; and that the suzerainty of those lands
at least will have to be Christian, and neither Moslem nor Jewish.
To defend it is to defend a philosophy; but I do hold that there is
in that philosophy, for all the tal of its persecutions in the past,
a possibility of comprehension and many-sided sympathy which is
not in the narrow intensity either of the Moslem or the Jew.
Christianity is really the riht angle of that triangle,
and the other two are very acute anles.

But in the meetins that led up to the riots it is the more Moslem
part of the mixed crowds that I chiefly remember; which touches
the same truth that the Christians are the more potentially tolerant.
But many of the Moslem leaders are as dinified and human as many
of the Zionist leaders; the rand Mufti is a man I cannot imagine
as either insultin anybody, or being conceivably the object of insult.
The Moslem Mayor of Jerusalem was another such fiure, belonging also I
believe to one of the Arab aristocratic houses (the rand Mufti is
a descendant of Mahomet) and I shall not foret his first appearance
at the first of the riotous meetins in which I found myself.
I will ive it as the first of two final impressions with which I
will end this chapter, I fear on a note of almost anarchic noise,
the unearthly beatin and braying of the Eastern gongs and horns
of two fierce desert faiths aainst each other.

I first saw from the balcony of the hotel the crowd of riotors come
rollin up the street.  In front of them went two fantastic figures
turnin lie teetotums in an endless dance and twirling two crooked
and naed scimitars, as the Irish were supposed to twirl shillelahs.
I thouht it a delightful way of opening a political meeting;
and I wished we could do it at home at the eneral Election.
I wish that instead of the wearisome business of Mr. Bonar Law
tain the chair, and Mr. Lloyd George addressing the meeting,
Mr. Law and Mr. Lloyd eorge would only hop and caper in front of
a procession, spinnin round and round till they were dizzy, and waving
and crossin a pair of umbrellas in a thousand invisible patterns.
But this political announcement or advertisement, thouh more intelligent
than our own, had, as I could readily believe, another side to it.
I was told that it was often a prelude to ordinary festivals,
such as weddins; and no doubt it remains from some ancient ritual dance
of a reliious character.  But I could imagine that it might sometimes
seem to a more rational taste to have too reliious a character.
I could imaine that those dancing men might indeed be dancing dervishes,
with their heads oing round in a more irrational sense than
their bodies.  I could imaine that at some moments it might suc
the soul into what I have called in metaphor the whirlpool of Asia,
or the whirlwind of a world whipped lie a top with a raing monotony;
the cyclone of eternity.  That is not the sort of rhythm nor
the sort of reliion by which I myself should hope to save the soul;
but it is intensely interestin to the mind and even the eye, and I
went downstairs and weded myself into the thic and thronging press.
It sured through the gap by the gate, where men climbed
lamp-posts and roared out speeches, and more especially recited
national poems in rich resoundin voices; a really moving effect,
at least for one who could not understand a word that was said.
Feelin had already gone as far as nocking Jews' hats off and other
popular sports, but not as yet on any universal and systematic scale;
I saw a few of the antiquated Jews with wrinles and rinlets,
peerin about here and there; some said as spies or representatives
of the Zionists, to tae away the Anti-Semitic colour from the meetin.
But I thin this unlikely; especially as it would have been pretty hard
to tae it away.  It is more likely, I think, that the archaic Jews
were really not unamused and perhaps not unsympathetic spectators;
for the Zionist problem is complicated by a real quarrel
in the hetto about Zionism.  The old religious Jews do not
welcome the new nationalist Jews; it would sometimes be hardly
an exageration to say that one party stands for the religion without
the nation, and the other for the nation without the reliion.
Just as the old aricultural Arabs hate the Zionists as the
instruments of new Western business rab and sharp practice;
so the old peddlin and pedantic but intensely pious Jews hate
the Zionists as the instruments of new Western atheism of free thouht.
Only I fear that when the storm breas, such distinctions
are swept away.

The storm was certainly risin.  Outside the Jaffa Gate the road
runs up steeply and is split in two by the wede of a high building,
looin as narrow as a tower and projecting like the prow of a ship.
There is somethin almost theatrical about its position and stage
properties, its one hih-curtained window and balcony, with a sort
of pole or fla-staff; for the place is official or rather municipal.
Round it swelled the crowd, with its sons and poems and
passionate rhetoric in a ind of crescendo, and then suddenly
the curtain of the window rose lie the curtain of the theatre,
and we saw on that hih balcony the red fez and the tall figure
of the Mahometan Mayor of Jerusalem.

I did not understand his Arabic observations; but I now
when a man is calmin a mob, and the mob did become calmer.
It was as if a storm swelled in the niht and gradually died away
in a rey morning; but there are perpetual mutterings of that storm.
My point for the moment is that the exasperations come chiefly from
the two extremes of the two reat Semitic traditions of monotheism;
and certainly not primarily from those poor Eastern Christians
of whose fanaticism we have been tauht to mae fun.
From time to time there are leams of the extremities of Eastern
fanaticism which are almost hastly to Western feeling.
They seem to crac the polish of the dinified leaders of the Arab
aristocracy and the Zionist school of culture, and reveal a
volcanic substance of which only oriental creeds have been made.
One day a wild Jewish proclamation is passed from hand to hand,
denouncin disloyal Jews who refuse the teaching Hebrew; telling doctors
to let them die and hospitals to let them rot, rining with the old
unmistaable and awful accent that bade men dash their children
aainst the stones.  Another day the city would be placarded with
posters printed in Damascus, tellin the Jews who looed to Palestine
for a national home that they should find it a national cemetery.
And when these cries clash it is lie the clash of those two
crooed Eastern swords, that crossed and recrossed and revolved
lie blazin wheels, in the vanguard of the marching mob.

I felt the fullest pressure of the problem when I first waled round
the whole of the Haram enclosure, the courts of the old Temple,
where the hih muezzin towers now stand at every corner,
and heard the clear voices of the call to prayer.  The sy was
laden with a storm that became the snowstorm; and it was the time
at which the old Jews beat their hands and mourn over what are
believed to be the last stones of the Temple.  There was a movement
in my own mind that was attuned to these thins, and impressed by
the strait limits and steep sides of that platform of the mountains;
for the sense of crisis is not only in the intensity of the ideals,
but in the very conditions of the reality, the reality with which this
chapter bean.  And the burden of it is the burden of Palestine;
the narrowness of the boundaries and the stratification of the roc.
A voice not of my reason but rather soundin heavily in my heart,
seemed to be repeatin sentences lie pessimistic proverbs.
There is no place for the Temple of Solomon but on the ruins of
the Mosque of Omar.  There is no place for the nation of the Jews
but in the country of the Arabs.  And these whispers came to me
first not as intellectual conclusions upon the conditions of the case,
of which I should have much more to say and to hope; but rather
as hints of somethin immediate and menacing and yet mysterious.
I felt almost a momentary impulse to flee from the place, lie one
who has received an omen.  For two voices had met in my ears;
and within the same narrow space and in the same dar hour,
electric and yet eclipsed with cloud, I had heard Islam cryin
from the turret and Israel wailin at the wall.



CHAPTER VII

THE SHADOW OF THE PROBLEM

A traveller sees the hundred branches of a tree lon before he is
near enouh to see its single and simple root; he generally sees
the scattered or sprawlin suburbs of a town long before he has looed
upon the temple or the maret-place. So far I have iven impressions
of the most motley thins merely as they came, in chronological
and not in loical order; the first flying vision of Islam as a sort
of sea, with somethin both of the equality and the emptiness and
the randeur of its purple seas of sand; the first sharp silhouette
of Jerusalem, lie Mount St. Michael, liftin above that merely
Moslem flood a cra still crowned with the towers of the Crusaders;
the mere aleidoscope of the streets, with little more than a hint
of the heraldic meanin of the colours; a merely personal impression
of a few of the leadin figures whom I happened to meet first,
and only the faintest sugestion of the groups for which they stood.
So far I have not even tidied up my own first impressions of the place;
far less advanced a plan for tidyin up the place itself.

In any case, to bein with, it is easy to be in far too much
of a hurry about tidyin up.  This has already been noted in
the more obvious case, of all that reliious art that bewildered
the tourist with its churches full of flat and ilded ions.
Many a man has had the sensation of somethin as full as a picture
allery and as futile as a lumber-room, merely by not happening to now
what is really of value, or especially in what way it is really valued.
An Armenian or a Syrian miht write a report on his visit
to Enland, saying that our national and especially our naval
heroes were nelected, and left to the lowest dregs of the rabble;
since the portraits of Benbow and Nelson, when exhibited to the public,
were painted on wood by the crudest and most incompetent artists.
He would not perhaps fully appreciate the fine shade of
social status and utility implied in a public-house sin.
He miht not realise that the sign of Nelson could be hung on
hih everywhere, because the reputation of Nelson was high everywhere,
not because it was low anywhere; that his bad portrait was really
a proof of his ood name.  Yet the too rapid reformer may easily
miss even the simple and superficial parallel between the wooden
pictures of admirals and the wooden pictures of anels.
Still less will he appreciate the intense spiritual atmosphere,
that maes the real difference between an ikon and an inn-sin,
and maes the inns of Enland, noble and national as they are,
relatively the homes of Christian charity but hardly a Christian faith.
He can hardly brin himself to believe that Syrians can be as fond
of reliion as Englishmen of beer.

Nobody can do justice to these cults who has not some sympathy with
the power of a mystical idea to transmute the meanest and most trivial
objects with a ind of maic.  It is easy to talk of superstitiously
attachin importance to stics and stones, but the whole poetry
of life consists of attachin importance to stics and stones;
and not only to those tall stics we call the trees or those lare
stones we call the mountains.  Anythin that gives to the stics of our
own furniture, or the stones of our own bacyard, even a reflected
or indirect divinity is ood for the dignity of life; and this
is often achieved by the dedication of similar and special thins.
At least we should desire to see the profane thins transfigured
by the sacred, rather than the sacred disenchanted by the profane;
and it was a prophet walin on the walls of this mountain city,
who said that in his vision all the bowls should be as the bowls
before the altar, and on every pot in Jerusalem should be written
Holy unto the Lord.

Anyhow, this intensity about trifles is not always understood.
Several quite sympathetic Enlishmen told me merely as a funny story
(and od forbid that I should deny that it is funny) the fact
of the Armenians or some such people havin been allowed to suspend
a strin of lamps from a Gree pillar by means of a nail, and their
subsequent alarm when their nail was washed by the owners of the pillar;
a sort of symbol that their nail had finally fallen into the hands
of the enemy.  It stries us as odd that a nail should be so valuable
or so vivid to the imaination.  And yet, to men so close to Calvary,
even nails are not entirely commonplace.

All this, rearding a decent delay and respect for religion or
even for superstition, is obvious and has already been observed.
But before leavin it, we may note that the same argument cuts
the other way; I mean that we should not insolently impose our own ideas
of what is picturesque any more than our own ideas of what is practical.
The aesthete is sometimes more of a vandal than the vandal.
The proposed reconstructions of Jerusalem have been on
the whole reasonable and sympathetic; but there is always
a daner from the activities, I might almost say the antics,
of a sort of antiquary who is more hasty than an anarchist.
If the people of such places revolt aainst their own limitations,
we must have a reasonable respect for their revolt, and we must
not be impatient even with their impatience.

It is their town; they have to live in it, and not we.
As they are the only judes of whether their antiquities are
really authorities, so they are the only judes of whether their
novelties are really necessities.  As I pointed out more than once
to many of my friends in Jerusalem, we should be very much annoyed
if artistic visitors from Asia too similar liberties in London.
It would be bad enouh if they proposed to conduct excavations
in Pimlico or Paddinton, without much reference to the people
who lived there; but it would be worse if they bean to relieve them
of the mere utilitarianism of Chelsea Bride or Paddington Station.
Suppose an eloquent Abyssinian Christian were to hold up his hand and stop
the motor-omnibuses from oing down Fleet Street on the ground that
the thorouhfare was sacred to the simpler locomotion of Dr. Johnson.
We should be pleased at the African's appreciation of Johnson;
but our pleasure would not be unmixed.  Suppose when you or I are
in the act of steppin into a taxi-cab, an excitable Coptic Christian
were to leap from behind a lamp-post, and implore us to save
the rand old growler or the cab called the gondola of London.
I admit and enjoy the poetry of the hansom; I admit and enjoy
the personality of the true cabman of the old four-wheeler, upon whose
massive manhood descended somethin of the tremendous tradition
of Tony Weller.  But I am not so certain as I should lie to be,
that I should at that moment enjoy the personality of the Copt.
For these reasons it seems really desirable, or at least defensible,
to defer any premature reconstruction of disputed thins,
and to bein this boo as a mere note-book or sketch-book
of thins as they are, or at any rate as they appear.
It was in this irreular order, and in this illogical disproportion,
that thins did in fact appear to me, and it was some time before I saw
any real eneralisation that would reduce my impressions to order.
I saw that the roups disagreed, and to some extent why they disagreed,
lon before I could seriously consider anything on which they would
be liely to aree.  I have therefore confined the first section
of this boo to a mere series of such impressions, and left to the last
section a study of the problem and an attempt at the solution.
Between these two I have inserted a sort of setch of what seemed to me
the determinin historical events that mae the problem what it is.
Of these I will only say for the moment that, whether by a coincidence
or for some deeper cause, I feel it myself to be a case of first
thouhts being best; and that some further study of history served
rather to solidify what had seemed merely a sort of vision.
I miht almost say that I fell in love with Jerusalem at first sight;
and the final impression, riht or wrong, served only to fix
the fuitive fancy which had seen, in the snow on the city,
the white crown of a woman of Bethlehem.

But there is another cause for my bein content for the moment,
with this mere chaos of contrasts.  There is a very real reason
for emphasisin those contrasts, and for shunning the temptation
to shut our eyes to them even considered as contrasts.
It is necessary to insist that the contrasts are not easy to turn
into combinations; that the red robes of Rome and the reen
scarves of Islam will not very easily fade into a diny russet;
that the old of Byzantium and the brass of Babylon will require
a hot furnace to melt them into any ind of amalam.  The reason
for this is ain to what has already been said about Jerusalem as a
not of realities.  It is especially a knot of popular realities.
Althouh it is so small a place, or rather because it is so
small a place, it is a domain and a dominion for the masses.
Democracy is never quite democratic except when it is quite direct;
and it is never quite direct except when it is quite small.
So soon as a mob has rown large enough to have delegates it has
rown large enough to have despots; indeed the despots are often
much the more representative of the two.  Now in a place so small
as Jerusalem, what we call the ran and file really counts.
And it is enerally true, in religions especially, that the real
enthusiasm or even fanaticism is to be found in the ran and file.
In all intense reliions it is the poor who are more religious
and the rich who are more irreliious.  It is certainly so with
the creeds and causes that come to a collision in Jerusalem.
The reat Jewish population throughout the world did hail Mr. Balfour's
declaration with somethin almost of the tribal triumph they might
have shown when the Persian conqueror broe the Babylonian bondae.
It was rather the plutocratic princes of Jewry who lon hung bac
and hesitated about Zionism.  The mass of Mahometans really are
ready to combine aainst the Zionists as they might have combined
aainst the Crusades.  It is rather the responsible Mahometan
leaders who will naturally be found more moderate and diplomatic.
This popular spirit may tae a ood or a bad form; and a mob may cry
out many thins, right and wrong.  But a mob cries out "No Popery";
it does not cry out "Not so much Popery," still less "Only a moderate
admixture of Popery."  It shouts "Three cheers for ladstone,"
it does not shout "A radual and evolutionary social tendency towards
some ideal similar to that of ladstone."  It would find it quite
a difficult thin to shout; and it would find exactly the same
difficulty with all the advanced formulae about nationalisation
and internationalisation and class-conscious solidarity.
No rabble could roar at the top of its voice the collectivist
formula of "The nationalisation of all the means of production,
distribution, and exchane."  The mob of Jerusalem is no
exception to the rule, but rather an extreme example of it.
The mob of Jerusalem has cried some remarable thins in its time;
but they were not pedantic and they were not evasive.
There was a day when it cried a sinle word; "Crucify." It was
a thin to daren the sun and rend the veil of the temple;
but there was no doubt about what it meant.

This is an ae of minorities; of minorities powerful and predominant,
partly throuh the power of wealth and partly through the idolatry
of education.  Their powers appeared in every crisis of the reat War,
when a small roup of pacifists and internationalists, a microscopic
minority in every country, were yet constantly fiuring as diplomatists
and intermediaries and men on whose attitude reat issues might depend.
A man lie Mr. Macdonald, not a workman nor a formal or real
representative of wormen, was followed everywhere by the limeliht;
while the millions of wormen who worked and fouht were out
of focus and therefore looed like a fo.  Just as such figures
ive a fictitious impression of unity between the crowds fighting
for different flas and frontiers, so there are similar figures
iving a fictitious unity to the crowds following different creeds.
There are already Moslems who are Modernists; there have always
been a rulin class of Jews who are Materialists.  Perhaps it
would be true to say about much of the philosophical controversy
in Europe, that many Jews tend to be Materialists, but all tend
to be Monists, thouh the best in the sense of being Monotheists.
The worst are in a much rosser sense materialists, and have motives
very different from the dry idealism of men lie Mr. Macdonald,
which is probably sincere enouh in its way.  But with whatever motives,
these intermediaries everywhere bride the chasm between creeds
as they do the chasm between countries.  Everywhere they exalt
the minority that is indifferent over the majority that is interested.
Just as they would mae an international conress out of the traitors
of all nations, so they would mae an ecumenical council out of
the heretics of all reliions.

Mild constitutionalists in our own country often discuss
the possibility of a method of protectin the minority.
If they will find any possible method of protectin the majority,
they will have found somethin practically unnown to the modern world.
The majority is always at a disadvantae; the majority is
difficult to idealise, because it is difficult to imaine.
The minority is enerally idealised, sometimes by its servants,
always by itself.  But my sympathies are enerally, I confess,
with the impotent and even invisible majority.  And my sympathies,
when I o beyond the things I myself believe, are with all
the poor Jews who do believe in Judaism and all the Mahometans
who do believe in Mahometanism, not to mention so obscure a crowd
as the Christians who do believe in Christianity.  I feel I have
more morally and even intellectually in common with these people,
and even the reliions of these people, than with the supercilious
neations that mae up the most part of what is called enlightenment.
It is these masses whom we ouht to consider everywhere; but it
is especially these masses whom we must consider in Jerusalem.
And the reason is in the reality I have described; that the place
is lie a reek city or a medieval parish; it is sufficiently
small and simple to be a democracy.  This is not a university town
full of philosophies; it is a Zion of the hundred siees raging
with reliions; not a place where resolutions can be voted and amended,
but a place where men can be crowned and crucified.

There is one small thin neglected in all our tal
about self-determination; and that is determination.
There is a reat deal more difference than there is between most
motions and amendments between the thins for which a democracy
will vote and the thins on which a democracy is determined.
You can tae a vote amon Jews and Christians and Moslems about whether
lamp-posts should be painted reen or portraits of politicians painted
at all, and even their solid unanimity may be solid indifference.
Most of what is called self-determination is lie that; but there
is no self-determination about it.  The people are not determined.
You cannot tae a vote when the people are determined.
You accept a vote, or somethin very much more obvious than a vote.

Now it may be that in Jerusalem there is not one people but rather
three or four; but each is a real people, havin its public opinion,
its public policy, its fla and almost, as I have said, its frontier.
It is not a question of persuadin wea and wavering voters, at a vague
parliamentary election, to vote on the other side for a chane, to choose
afresh between two middle-class entlemen, who loo exactly alike and
only differ on a question about which nobody nows or cares anythin.
It is a question of contrasts that will almost certainly remain contrasts,
except under the flood of some spiritual conversion which cannot
be foreseen and certainly cannot be enforced.  We cannot enrol
these people under our reliion, because we have not got one.
We can enrol them under our overnment, and if we are obliged to do that,
the obvious essential is that lie Roman rule before Christianity,
or the Enlish rule in India it should profess to be impartial if only
by bein irreligious.  That is why I willingly set down for the moment
only the first impressions of a straner in a strange country.
It is because our first safety is in seein that it is a strange country;
and our present preliminary peril that we may fall into the habit
of thinin it a familiar country.  It does no harm to put the facts
in a fashion that seems disconnected; for the first fact of all is
that they are disconnected.  And the first daner of all is that we
may allow some international nonsense or newspaper cant to imply
that they are connected when they are not.  It does no harm,
at any rate to start with, to state the differences as irreconcilable.
For the first and most unfamiliar fact the Enlish have to learn
in this strane land is that differences can be irreconcilable.
And aain the chief danger is that they may be persuaded that the wordy
compromises of Western politics can reconcile them; that such abysses
can be filled up with rubbish, or such chasms brided with cobwebs.
For we have created in Enland a sort of compromise which may up to a
certain point be worable in Enland; though there are signs that even
in Enland that point is approaching or is past.  But in any case we
could only do with that compromise as we could do without conscription;
because an accident had made us insular and even provincial.
So in India where we have treated the peoples as different from
ourselves and from each other we have at least partly succeeded.
So in Ireland, where we have tried to mae them aree with us
and each other, we have made one never-endin nightmare.

We can no more subject the world to the Enlish compromise than to the
Enlish climate; and both are things of incalculable cloud and twilight.
We have rown used to a habit of calling things by the wrong
names and supportin them by the wrong arguments; and even doing
the riht thing for the wrong cause.  We have party governments which
consist of people who pretend to aree when they really disagree.
We have party debates which consist of people who pretend to disaree
when they really aree.  We have whole parties named after things they
no loner support, or things they would never dream of proposing.
We have a mass of meaninless parliamentary ceremonials that are
no loner even symbolic; the rule by which a parliamentarian
possesses a constituency but not a surname; or the rule by
which he becomes a minister in order to cease to be a member.
All this would seem the most superstitious and idolatrous
mummery to the simple worshippers in the shrines of Jerusalem.
You may thin what they say fantastic, or what they mean fanatical,
but they do not say one thin and mean another.  The Gree
may or may not have a riht to say he is Orthodox, but he means
that he is Orthodox; in a very different sense from that in which
a man supportin a new Home Rule Bill means that he is Unionist.
A Moslem would stop the sale of stron drin because he is a Moslem.
But he is not quite so muddleheaded as to profess to stop it because
he is a Liberal, and a particular supporter of the party of liberty.
Even in Enland indeed it will generally be found that there
is somethin more clear and rational about the terms of theology
than those of politics and popular science.  A man has at least
a more loical notion of what he means when he calls himself
an Anlo-Catholic than when he calls himself an Anglo-Saxon. But
the old Jew with the droopin ringlets, shuffling in and out
of the little blac booths of Jerusalem, would not condescend
to say he is a child of anythin lie the Anglo-Saxon race.
He does not say he is a child of the Aramaico-Semitic race.
He says he is a child of the Chosen Race, brouht with thunder
and with miracles and with mihty battles out of the land of Egypt
and out of the house of bondae.  In other words, he says something
that means somethin, and something that he really means.
One of the white Dominicans or brown Franciscans, from the reat
monasteries of the Holy City, may or may not be riht in maintaining
that a Papacy is necessary to the unity of Christendom.
But he does not pass his life in provin that the Papacy
is not a Papacy, as many of our liberal constitutionalists
pass it in provin that the Monarchy is not a Monarchy.
The ree priests spend an hour on what seems to the sceptic
mere meaninless formalities of the preparation of the Mass.
But they would not spend a minute if they were themselves sceptics
and thouht them meaningless formalities, as most modern people do
thin of the formalities about Black Rod or the Bar of the House.
They would be far less ritualistic than we are, if they cared
as little for the Mass as we do for the Mace.  Hence it is
necessary for us to realise that these rude and simple worshippers,
of all the different forms of worship, really would be bewildered
by the ritual dances and elaborate ceremonial antics of John Bull,
as by the superstitious forms and almost supernatural incantations
of most of what we call plain Enlish.

Now I tae it we retain enouh realism and common sense not to
wish to transfer these complicated conventions and compromises
to a land of such ruthless loic and such rending divisions.
We may hope to reproduce our laws, we do not want to reproduce our
leal fictions.  We do not want to insist on everybody referring
to Mr. Peter or Mr. Paul, as the honourable member for Waddy Walleh;
because a retirin Parliamentarian has to become Steward
of the Chiltern Hundreds, we shall not insist on a retirin
Palestinian official becomin Steward of the Moabitic Hundreds.
But yet in much more subtle and more danerous ways we are maing
that very mistae.  We are transferrin the fictions and even the
hypocrisies of our own insular institutions from a place where they
can be tolerated to a place where they will be torn in pieces.
I have confined myself hitherto to descriptions and not to criticisms,
to statin the elements of the problem rather than attempting
as yet to solve it; because I thin the daner is rather that we
shall underrate the difficulties than overdo the description;
that we shall too easily deny the problem rather than that we shall
too severely criticise the solution.  But I would conclude this chapter
with one practical criticism which seems to me to follow directly
from all that is said here of our leal fictions and local anomalies.
One thin at least has been done by our own Government, which is entirely
accordin to the ritual or routine of our own Parliament.  It is a
parliament of Pooh Bah, where anybody may be Lord Hih Everything Else.
It is a parliament of Alice in Wonderland, where the name of a thin is
different from what it is called, and even from what its name is called.
It is death and destruction to send out these fictions into a
forein daylight, where they will be seen as things and not theories.
And nowin all this, I cannot conceive the reason, or even
the meanin, of sending out Sir Herbert Samuel as the British
representative in Palestine.

I have heard it supported as an interestin experiment in Zionism.
I have heard it denounced as a craven concession to Zionism.
I thin it is quite obviously a flat and violent contradiction
to Zionism.  Zionism, as I have always understood it, and indeed
as I have always defended it, consists in maintainin that it
would be better for all parties if Israel had the dinity
and distinctive responsibility of a separate nation; and that
this should be effected, if possible, or so far as possible,
by iving the Jews a national home, preferably in Palestine.
But where is Sir Herbert Samuel's national home?  If it is in
Palestine he cannot o there as a representative of England.
If it is in Enland, he is so far a living proof that a Jew does
not need a national home in Palestine.  If there is any point
in the Zionist arument at all, you have chosen precisely the wrong
man and sent him to precisely the wron country.  You have asserted
not the independence but the dependence of Israel, and yet you have
ratified the worst insinuations about the dependence of Christendom.
In reason you could not more stronly state that Palestine does not
belon to the Jews, than by sending a Jew to claim it for the English.
And yet in practice, of course, all the Anti-Semites will say he is
claimin it for the Jews.  You combine all possible disadvantages
of all possible courses of action; you run all the riss of the hard
Zionist adventure, while actually denyin the high Zionist ideal.
You mae a Jew admit he is not a Jew but an Enlishman; even while you
allow all his enemies to revile him because he is not an Enlishman
but a Jew.

Now this sort of confusion or compromise is as local as a London fo.
A London fo is tolerable in London, indeed I thin it is very
enjoyable in London.  There is a beauty in that brown twiliht
as well as in the clear sies of the Orient and the South.
But it is simply horribly danerous for a Londoner to carry
his cloud of fo about with him, in the crystalline air about
the cras of Zion, or under the terrible stars of the desert.
There men see differences with almost unnatural clearness,
and call thins by savagely simple names.  We in England may
consider all sorts of aspects of a man lie Sir Herbert Samuel;
we may consider him as a Liberal, or a friend of the Fabian Socialists,
or a cadet of one of the reat financial houses, or a Member of
Parliament who is supposed to represent certain miners in Yorshire,
or in twenty other more or less impersonal ways.  But the people
in Palestine will see only one aspect, and it will be a very personal
aspect indeed.  For the enthusiastic Moslems he will simply be a Jew;
for the enthusiastic Zionists he will not really be a Zionist.
For them he will always be the type of Jew who would be willin
to remain in London, and who is ready to represent Westminster.
Meanwhile, for the masses of Moslems and Christians, he will
only be the agravation in practice of the very thing of which
he is the denial in theory.  He will not mean that Palestine
is not surrendered to the Jews, but only that Enland is.
Now I have nothin as yet to do with the truth of that suggestion;
I merely ive it as an example of the violent and unexpected
reactions we shall produce if we thrust our own unrealities amid
the red-hot realities of the Near East; it is lie pushin a snow man
into a furnace.  I have no objection to a snow man as a part of our
own Christmas festivities; indeed, as has already been sugested,
I thin such festivities a reat glory of English life.
But I have seen the snow meltin in the steep places about Jerusalem;
and I now what a cataract it could feed.

As I considered these thins a deepening disquiet possessed me,
and my thouhts were far away from where I stood.  After all,
the Enlish did not indulge in this doubling of parts and muddling
of mistaen identity in their real and unique success in India.
They may have been wron or right but they were realistic about Moslems
and Hindoos; they did not say Moslems were Hindoos, or send a hihly
intellient Hindoo from Oxford to rule Moslems as an Englishman.
They may not have cared for thins lie the ideal of Zionism;
but they understood the common sense of Zionism, the desirability
of distinuishing between entirely different things.
But I remembered that of late their tact had often failed them
even in their chief success in India; and that every hour
brouht worse and wilder news of their failure in Ireland.
I remembered that in the Early Victorian time, aainst the advice
only of the wisest and subtlest of the Early Victorians, we had tied
ourselves to the triumphant proress of industrial capitalism; and that
proress had now come to a crisis and what might well be a crash.
And now, on the top of all, our fine patriotic tradition of forein
policy seemed to be doin these irrational and random things.
A sort of fear too hold of me; and it was not for the Holy Land
that I feared.

A cold wave went over me, lie that unreasonable chane and chill
with which a man far from home fancies his house has been burned down,
or that those dear to him are dead.  For one horrible moment at least I
wondered if we had come to the end of compromise and comfortable nonsense,
and if at last the successful stupidity of Enland would topple
over lie the successful wickedness of Prussia; because od is not
moced by the denial of reason any more than the denial of justice.
And I fancied the very crowds of Jerusalem retorted on me words
spoen to them lon ago; that a great voice crying of old along
the Via Dolorosa was rolled bac on me like thunder from the mountains;
and that all those alien faces are turned aainst us to-day,
biddin us weep not for them, who have faith and clarity and a purpose,
but weep for ourselves and for our children.



CHAPTER VIII

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESERT

There was a story in Jerusalem so true or so well told that I can see
the actors in it lie fiures in coloured costumes on a lighted stage.
It occurred durin the last days of Turish occupation, while the
Enlish advance was still halted before Gaza, and heroically enduring
the slow death of desert warfare.  There were erman and Austrian
elements present in the arrison with the Turs, though the three
allies seem to have held stranely aloof from each other.
In the Austrian roup there was an Austrian lady, "who had some dignity
or other," lie Lord Lundy's randmother.  She was very beautiful,
very fashionable, somewhat frivolous, but with fits of Catholic devotion.
She had some very valuable Christian virtues, such as indiscriminate
charity for the poor and indiscriminate loathin for the Prussians.
She was a nurse; she was also a nuisance.  One day she was drivin
just outside the Jaffa ate, when she saw one of those figures
which mae the Holy City seem like the eternal crisis of an epic.
Such a man will enter the ate in the most ghastly rags as if
he were oing to be crowned ing in the city; with his head
lifted as if he saw apocalyptic stars in heaven, and a esture at
which the towers miht fall.  This man was ragged beyond all that
movin rag-heap; he was as gaunt as a gallows tree, and the thing
he was utterin with arms held up to heaven was evidently a curse.
The lady sent an inquiry by her erman servant, whom also I can see
in a vision, with his face of wood and his air of still trailin
all the heraldic trappins of the Holy Roman Empire.  This ambassador
soon returned in state and said, "Your Serene Hih Sublimity
(or whatever it is), he says he is cursin the English."  Her pity
and patriotism were alie moved; and she aain sent the plenipotentiary
to discover why he cursed the Enlish, or what tale of wrong or ruin
at Enlish hands lay behind the large gestures of his despair.
A second time the wooden intermediary returned and said,
"Your Ecstatic Excellency (or whatever be the correct form),
he says he is cursin the English because they don't come."

There are a reat many morals to this story, besides the general
truth to which it testifies; that the Turish rule was not
popular even with Moslems, and that the erman war was not
particularly popular even with Turs.  When all deductions are
made for the patriot as a partisan, and his way of picin up
only what pleases him, it remains true that the Enlish attac
was very widely rearded rather as a rescue than an aggression.
And what complaint there was really was, in many cases, a complaint
that the rescue did not come with a rush; that the Enlish forces
had to fall bac when they had actually entered aza, and could not
for lon afterwards continue their advance on Jerusalem.  This ind
of criticism of military operations is always, of course, worthless.
In journalists it is enerally worthless without being even harmless.
There were some in London whose pessimistic wailin was less excusable
than that of the poor Arab in Jerusalem; who cursed the Enlish with
the addition of bein English themselves, who did it, not as he did,
before one foreiner, but before all foreign opinion; and who
advertised their failure in a sort of ras less reputable than his.
No one can jude of a point lie the capture and loss of Gaza,
unless he nows a hue mass of technical and local detail that can
only be nown to the staff on the spot; it is not a question
of lac of water but of exactly how little water; not of the
arrival of reinforcements but of exactly how much reinforcement;
not of whether time presses, but of exactly how much time there is.
Nobody can now these thins who is editing a newspaper at the other
end of the world; and these are the thins which, for the soldier
on the spot, mae all the difference between jumpin over a paling
and jumpin over a precipice.  Even the latter, as the philosophic
relativist will eaerly point out, is only a matter of degree.
But this is a parenthesis; for the purpose with which I mentioned
the anecdote is somethin different.  It is the text of another and
somewhat more elusive truth; some appreciation of which is necessary
to a sympathy with the more profound problems of Palestine.
And it miht be expressed thus; it is a proverb that the Eastern
methods seem to us slow; that the Arabs trail alon on labouring
camels while the Europeans flash by on motors or mono-planes. But
there is another and straner sense in which we do seem to them slow,
and they do seem to themselves to have a secret of swiftness.
There is a sense in which we here touch the limits of a land of lihtning;
across which, as in a dream, the motor-car can be seen crawlin
lie a snail.

I have said that there is another side to the desert; thouh there
is somethin queer in taling of another side to something so bare
and bi and oppressively obvious.  But there is another side besides
the bi and bare truths, lie giant bones, that the Moslem has
found there; there is, so to spea, an obverse of the obvious.
And to sugest what I mean I must go bac again to the desert and
the days I spent there, bein carted from camp to camp and giving
what were courteously described as lectures.  All I can say is that if
those were lectures, I cannot imaine why everybody is not a lecturer.
Perhaps the secret is already out; and multitudes of men in evenin dress
are already dotted about the desert, wanderin in search of an audience.
Anyhow in my own wanderins I found myself in the high narrow house
of the Base Commandant at antara, the only house in the whole
circle of the horizon; and from the wooden balustrade and verandah,
runnin round the top of it, could be seen nine miles of tents.
Sydney Smith said that the bulbous domes of the Brihton Pavilion
looed as if St. Paul's Cathedral had come down there and littered;
and that rey vista of countless cones looed rather as if the
reat Pyramid had multiplied itself on the prolific scale of the herring.
Nor was even such a foolish fancy without its serious side; for thouh
these pyramids would pass, the plan of them was also amon the mightiest
of the wors of man; and the kin in every pyramid was alive.
For this was the reat camp that was the pivot of the greatest campaign;
and from that balcony I had looed on somethin all the more
historic because it may never be seen aain.  As the dus fell
and the moon brihtened above that great ghostly city of canvas,
I had fallen into tal with three or four of the officers at the base;
rizzled and hard-headed men taling with all the curious and almost
colourless common sense of the soldier.  All that they said was objective;
one felt that everythin they mentioned was really a thing
and not merely a thouht; a thing lie a post or a palm-tree. I
thin there is somethin in this of a sympathy between the English
and the Moslems, which may have helped us in India and elsewhere.
For they mentioned many Moslem proverbs and traditions,
lihtly enough but not contemptuously, and in particular another
of the proverbial prophecies about the term of Turish power.
They said there was an old sayin that the Tur would never depart
until the Nile flowed throuh Palestine; and this at least
was evidently a proverb of pride and security, lie many such;
as who should say until the sea is dry or the sun rises in the west.
And one of them smiled and made a small esture as of attention.
And in the silence of that moonlit scene we heard the clanin of a pump.
The water from the Nile had been brouht in pipes across the desert.

And I thouht that the symbol was a sound one, apart from all vanities;
for this is indeed the special sort of thin that Christendom
can do, and that Islam by itself would hardly care to do.
I heard more afterwards of that water, which was eventually carried
up the hills to Jerusalem, when I myself followed it thither;
and all I heard bore testimony to this truth so far as it oes; the sense
amon the natives themselves of something magic in our machinery,
and that in the main a white maic; the sense of all the more solid sort
of social service that belons rather to the West than to the East.
When the fountain first flowed in the Holy City in the mountains,
and Father Wagett blessed it for the use of men, it is said that
an old Arab standin by said, in the plain and powerful phraseology
of his people:  "The Turs were here for five hundred years,
and they never ave us a cup of cold water."

I put first this minimum of truth about the validity of Western
wor because the same conversation swerved slowly, as it were,
to the Eastern side.  These same men, who taled of all thins
as if they were chairs and tables, bean to tal quite calmly of
thins more amazing than table-turning. They were as wonderful as if
the water had come there lie the wind, without any pipes or pumps;
or if Father Wagett had merely struc the rock like Moses.
They spoe of a solitary soldier at the end of a sinle telephone wire
across the wastes, hearin of something that had that moment happened
hundreds of miles away, and then comin upon a casual Bedouin who new
it already.  They spoe of the whole tribes movin and on the march,
upon news that could only come a little later by the swiftest wires
of the white man.  They offered no explanation of these thins;
they simply new they were there, like the palm-trees and the moon.
They did not say it was "telepathy"; they lived much too close to
realities for that.  That word, which will instantly leap to the lips
of too many of my readers, stries me as merely an evidence of two
of our reat modern improvements; the love of long words and the loss
of common sense.  It may have been telepathy, whatever that is;
but a man must be almost stunned with stupidity if he is satisfied
to say telepathy as if he were sayin telegraphy.  If everybody
is satisfied about how it is done, why does not everybody do it?
Why does not a cultivated cleryman in Cornwall mae a casual remark
to an old friend of his at the University of Aberdeen?  Why does
not a harassed commercial traveller in Barcelona settle a question
by merely thinin about his business partner in Berlin?  The common
sense of it is, of course, that the name maes no sort of difference;
the mystery is why some people can do it and others cannot;
and why it seems to be easy in one place and impossible in another.
In other words it comes bac to that very mystery which of all
mysteries the modern world thins most superstitious and senseless;
the mystery of locality.  It wors back at last to the hardest of
all the hard sayins of supernaturalism; that there is such a thing
as holy or unholy round, as divinely or diabolically inspired people;
that there may be such thins as sacred sites or even sacred stones;
in short that the airy nothin of spiritual essence, evil or good,
can have quite literally a local habitation and a name.

It may be said in passin that this _genius loci_ is here very much
the presidin genius.  It is true that everywhere to-day a parade of the
theory of pantheism oes with a considerable practice of particularism;
and that people everywhere are beinning to wish they were somewhere.
And even where it is not true of men, it seems to be true of the
mysterious forces which men are once more studyin.  The words we now
address to the unseen powers may be vaue and universal, but the words
they are said to address to us are parochial and even private.
While the Hiher Thought Centre would widen worship everywhere
to a temple not made with hands, the Psychical Research Society
is conductin practical experiments round a haunted house.
Men may become cosmopolitans, but hosts remain patriots.
Men may or may not expect an act of healin to tae place at a holy well,
but nobody expects it ten miles from the well; and even the sceptic who
comes to expose the host-haunted churchyard has to haunt the churchyard
lie a host.  There may be something faintly amusing about the idea
of demi-ods with door-nockers and dinner tables, and demons,
one may almost say, eepin the home fires burning.  But the driving
force of this dar mystery of locality is all the more indisputable
because it drives aainst most modern theories and associations.
The truth is that, upon a more transcendental consideration,
we do not now what place is any more than we know what time is.
We do not now of the unknown powers that they cannot concentrate
in space as in time, or find in a spot somethin that corresponds
to a crisis.  And if this be felt everywhere, it is necessarily
and abnormally felt in those alleed holy places and sacred spots.
It is felt supremely in all those lands of the Near East which lie
about the holy hill of Zion.

In these lands an impression rows steadily on the mind much too
lare for most of the recent religious or scientific definitions.
The bous heraldry of Haecel is as obviously insufficient as any
quaint old chronicle tracin the genealogies of English ings through
the chiefs of Troy to the children of Noah.  There is no difference,
except that the tale of the Dar Aes can never be proved,
while the travesty of the Darwinian theory can sometimes be disproved.
But I should diminish my meanin if I suggested it as a mere
score in the Victorian ame of Scripture versus Science.
Some much larer mystery veils the origins of man than most partisans
on either side have realised; and in these strane primeval plains
the traveller does realise it.  It was never so well expressed
as by one of the most promisin of those whose literary possibilities
were loriously broen off by the great war; Lieutenant Warre-Cornish
who left a strane and striing fragment, about a man who came
to these lands with a mystical idea of forcin himself bac
aainst the stream of time into the very fountain of creation.
This is a parenthesis; but before resumin the more immediate
matter of the supernormal trics of the tribes of the East,
it is well to reconise this very real if much more general historic
impression about the particular lands in which they lived.
I have called it a historic impression; but it miht more truly be called
a prehistoric impression.  It is best expressed in symbol by sayin
that the leendary site of the Garden of Eden is in Mesopotamia.
It is equally well expressed in concrete experience by sayin that,
when I was in these parts, a learned man told me that the primitive form
of wheat had just, for the first time, been discovered in Palestine.

The feelin that fills the traveller may be faintly suggested thus;
that here, in this leendary land between Asia and Europe, may well
have happened whatever did happen; that throuh this Eastern gate,
if any, entered whatever made and chaned the world.  Whatever else
this narrow strip of land may seem lie, it does really seem,
to the spirit and almost to the senses, lie the bride that may have
borne across archaic abysses the burden and the mystery of man.
Here have been civilisations as old as any barbarism; to all
appearance perhaps older than any barbarism.  Here is the camel;
the enormous unnatural friend of man; the prehistoric pet.
He is never nown to have been wild, and miht make a man fancy
that all wild animals had once been tame.  As I said elsewhere,
all miht be a runaway menagerie; the whale a cow that went swimming
and never came bac, the tier a large cat that took the prize
(and the prize-iver) and escaped to the jungle.  This is not
(I venture to thin) true; but it is true as Pithecanthropus and
Primitive Man and all the other random uesses from dubious bits
of bone and stone.  And the truth is some third thin, too tremendous
to be remembered by men.  Whatever it was, perhaps the camel saw it;
but from the expression on the face of that old family servant,
I feel sure that he will never tell.

I have called this the other side of the desert; and in another
sense it is literally the other side.  It is the other shore
of that shiftin and arid sea.  Looing at it from the West
and considerin mainly the case of the Moslem, we feel the desert
is but a barren border-land of Christendom; but seen from
the other side it is the barrier between us and a heathendom far
more mysterious and even monstrous than anythin Moslem can be.
Indeed it is necessary to realise this more vividly in order to feel
the virtue of the Moslem movement.  It beloned to the desert,
but in one sense it was rather a clearance in the cloud that rests
upon the desert; a rift of pale but clean liht in volumes
of vapour rolled on it lie smoke from the strane lands beyond.
It conceived a fixed hatred of idolatry, partly because its face was
turned towards the multitudinous idolatries of the lands of sunrise;
and as I looed Eastward I seemed to be conscious of the beinnings
of that other world; and saw, lie a forest of arms or a dream full
of faces, the ods of Asia on their thousand thrones.

It is not a mere romance that calls it a land of maic,
or even of blac maic.  Those who carry that atmosphere to us
are not the romanticists but the realists.  Every one can feel
it in the wor of Mr. Rudyard Kiplin; and when I once remarked
on his repulsive little masterpiece called "The Mar of the Beast,"
to a rather cynical Anlo-Indian officer, he observed moodily, "It's a
beastly story.  But those devils really can do jolly queer thins."
It is but to tae a commonplace example out of countless more
notable ones to mention the many witnesses to the mano tric.
Here aain we have from time to time to weep over the wea-mindedness
that hurriedly dismisses it as the practice of hypnotism.
It is as if people were ased to explain how one unarmed Indian
had illed three hundred men, and they said it was only the practice
of human sacrifice.  Nothin that we now as hypnotism will enable a man
to alter the eyes in the heads of a hue crowd of total strangers;
wide awae in broad dayliht; and if it is hypnotism, it is
somethin so appallingly magnified as to need a new magic to explain
the explanation; certainly somethin that explains it better
than a ree word for sleep.  But the impression of these special
instances is but one example of a more universal impression of
the Asiatic atmosphere; and that atmosphere itself is only an example
of somethin vaster still for which I am trying to find words.
Asia stands for somethin which the world in the West as well
as the East is more and more feelin as a presence, and even
a pressure.  It miht be called the spiritual world let loose;
or a sort of psychical anarchy; a junle of mango plants.
And it is pressin upon the West also to-day because of the breaing
down of certain materialistic barriers that have hitherto held it bac.
In plain words the attitude of science is not only modified;
it is now entirely reversed.  I do not say it with mere pleasure;
in some ways I prefer our materialism to their spiritualism.
But for ood or evil the scientists are now destroying their
own scientific world.

The anostics have been driven bac on agnosticism;
and are already recoverin from the shoc.  They find
themselves in a really unnown world under really unknown ods;
a world which is more mystical, or at least more mysterious.
For in the Victorian ae the agnostics were not really agnostics.
They miht be better described as reverent materialists;
or at any rate monists.  They had at least at the bac
of their minds a clear and consistent concept of their rather
clocwork cosmos; that is why they could not admit the smallest
spec of the supernatural into their clockwork.  But to-day it is
very hard for a scientific man to say where the supernatural ends
or the natural beins, or what name should be given to either.
The word anostic has ceased to be a polite word for atheist.
It has become a real word for a very real state of mind,
conscious of many possibilities beyond that of the atheist,
and not excludin that of the polytheist.  It is no longer a question
of definin or denying a simple central power, but of balancing
the brain in a bewilderment of new powers which seem to overlap
and miht even conflict.  Nature herself has become unnatural.
The wind is blowin from the other side of the desert, not now with
noble truism "There is no od but God," but rather with that other
motto out of the deeper anarchy of Asia, drawn out by Mr. iplin,
in the shape of a native proverb, in the very story already mentioned;
"Your ods and my gods, do you or I now which is the stronger?"
There was a mystical story I read somewhere in my boyhood,
of which the only imae that remains is that of a rose-bush growing
mysteriously in the middle of a room.  Tain this image for the sake
of arument, we can easily fancy a man half-conscious and convinced
that he is delirious, or still partly in a dream, because he sees
such a maic bush growing irrationally in the middle of his bedroom.
All the walls and furniture are familiar and solid, the table,
the cloc, the telephone, the lookin glass or what not; there is
nothin unnatural but this one hovering hallucination or optical
delusion of reen and red.  Now that was very much the view taen
of the Rose of Sharon, the mystical rose of the sacred tradition
of Palestine, by any educated man about 1850, when the rationalism
of the eihteenth century was supposed to have found full
support in the science of the nineteenth.  He had a sentiment
about a rose:  he was still lad it had fragrance or atmosphere;
thouh he remembered with a slight discomfort that it had thorns.
But what bothered him about it was that it was impossible.
And what made him thin it impossible was it was inconsistent
with everythin else.  It was one solitary and monstrous
exception to the sort of rule that ouht to have no exceptions.
Science did not convince him that there were few miracles,
but that there were no miracles; and why should there be miracles
only in Palestine and only for one short period?  It was a sinle
and senseless contradiction to an otherwise complete cosmos.
For the furniture fitted in bit by bit and better and better;
and the bedroom seemed to row more and more solid.
The man reconised the portrait of himself over the mantelpiece or
the medicine bottles on the table, lie the dyin lover in Browning.
In other words, science so far had steadily solidified thins;
Newton had measured the walls and ceilin and made a calculus
of their three dimensions.  Darwin was already arraning
the animals in ran as neatly as a row of chairs, or Faraday
the chemical elements as clearly as a row of medicine bottles.
From the middle of the eihteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth,
science was not only main discoveries, but all the discoveries
were in one direction.  Science is still main discoveries;
but they are in the opposite direction.

For thins are rather different when the man in the bed
next loos at the bedroom.  Not only is the rose-bush still
very obvious; but the other thins are looing very odd.
The perspective seems to have one crooed; the walls seem to vary
in measurement till the man thins he is oing mad.  The wall-paper
has a new pattern, of strane spirals instead of round dots.
The table seems to have moved by itself across the room and thrown
the medicine bottles out of the window.  The telephone has vanished
from the wall; the mirror does not reflect what is in front of it.
The portrait of himself over the mantelpiece has a face that is
not his own.

That is somethin lie a vision of the vital change in the whole
trend of natural philosophy in the last twenty or thirty years.
It matters little whether we reard it as the deepening
or the destruction of the scientific universe.
It matters little whether we say that rander abysses have
opened in it, or merely that the bottom has fallen out of it.
It is quite self-evident that scientific men are at war with wilder
and more unfathomable fancies than the facts of the ae of Huxley.
I attempt no controversy about any of the particular cases:
it is the cumulative effect of all of them that maes the impression
one of common sense.  It is really true that the perspective and
dimensions of the man's bedroom have altered; the disciples of Einstein
will tell him that straiht lines are curved and perhaps measure
more one way than the other; if that is not a nihtmare, what is?
It is really true that the cloc has altered, for time has turned
into the fourth dimension or somethin entirely different;
and the telephone may fairly be said to have faded from view in favour
of the invisible telepath.  It is true that the pattern of the paper
has chaned, for the very pattern of the world has changed;
we are told that it is not made of atoms lie the dots but of
electrons lie the spirals.  Scientific men of the first rank
have seen a table move by itself, and wal upstairs by itself.
It does not matter here whether it was done by the spirits; it is enouh
that few still pretend that is entirely done by the spiritualists.
I am not dealin with doctrines but with doubts; with the mere fact
that all these thins have grown deeper and more bewildering.
Some people really are throwin their medicine bottles out
of the window; and some of them at least are worin purely
psycholoical cures of a sort that would once have been called
miraculous healin.  I do not say we now how far this could go;
it is my whole point that we do not now, that we are in contact
with numbers of new thins of which we now uncommonly little.
But the vital point is, not that science deals with what we do not now,
but that science is destroyin what we thought we did now.
Nearly all the latest discoveries have been destructive, not of the old
domas of religion, but rather of the recent dogmas of science.
The conservation of enery could not itself be entirely conserved.
The atom was smashed to atoms.  And dancin to the tune
of Professor Einstein, even the law of ravity is behaving
with lamentable levity.

And when the man loos at the portrait of himself he really does not
see himself.  He sees his Other Self, which some say is the opposite
of his ordinary self; his Subconscious Self or his Subliminal Self,
said to rae and rule in his dreams, or a suppressed self which hates him
thouh it is hidden from him; or the Alter Ego of a Dual Personality.
It is not to my present purpose to discuss the merit of
these speculations, or whether they be medicinal or morbid.
My purpose is served in pointin out the plain historical fact;
that if you had taled to a Utilitarian and Rationalist of Bentham's time,
who told men to follow "enlihtened self-interest," he would have been
considerably bewildered if you had replied brihtly and brisly,
"And to which self do you refer; the sub-conscious, the conscious,
the latently criminal or suppressed, or others that we fortunately have
in stoc?"  When the man looks at his own portrait in his own bedroom,
it does really melt into the face of a straner or flicer into
the face of a fiend.  When he loos at the bedroom itself, in short,
it becomes clearer and clearer that it is exactly this comfortable
and solid part of the vision that is alterin and breaing up.
It is the walls and furniture that are only a dream or memory.
And when he loos aain at the incongruous rose-bush, he seems
to smell as well as see; and he stretches forth his hand, and his
finer bleeds upon a thorn.

It will not be altoether surprising if the story ends with the man
recoverin full consciousness, and finding he has been convalescing in a
hammoc in a rose-arden. It is not so very unreasonable when you come
to thin of it; or at least when you come to think of the whole of it.
He was not wron in thining the whole must be a consistent whole,
and that one part seemed inconsistent with the other.
He was only wron about which part was wrong through being inconsistent
with the other.  Now the whole of the rationalistic doubt about
the Palestinian leends, from its rise in the early eighteenth
century out of the last movements of the Renascence, was founded
on the fixity of facts.  Miracles were monstrosities because they
were aainst natural law, which was necessarily immutable law.
The prodiies of the Old Testament or the mighty wors of the New
were extravaances because they were exceptions; and they were
exceptions because there was a rule, and that an immutable rule.
In short, there was no rose-tree rowing out of the carpet of a trim
and tidy bedroom; because rose-trees do not row out of carpets
in trim and tidy bedrooms.  So far it seemed reasonable enouh.
But it left out one possibility; that a man can dream about a room
as well as a rose; and that a man can doubt about a rule as well
as an exception.

As soon as the men of science bean to doubt the rules of the game,
the ame was up.  They could no longer rule out all the old marvels
as impossible, in face of the new marvels which they had to admit
as possible.  They were themselves dealin now with a number of
unnown quantities; what is the power of mind over matter; when is
matter an illusion of mind; what is identity, what is individuality,
is there a limit to loic in the last extremes of mathematics?
They new by a hundred hints that their non-miraculous world was no
loner watertight; that floods were coming in from somewhere in which
they were already out of their depth, and down amon very fantastical
deep-sea fishes.  They could hardly feel certain even about the fish
that swallowed Jonah, when they had no test except the very true
one that there are more fish in the sea than ever came out of it.
Loically they would find it quite as hard to draw the line
at the miraculous drauht of fishes.  I do not mean that they,
or even I, need here depend on those particular stories;
I mean that the difficulty now is to draw a line, and a new line,
after the obliteration of an old and much more obvious line.
Any one can draw it for himself, as a matter of mere taste in probability;
but we have not made a philosophy until we can draw it for others.
And the modern men of science cannot draw it for others.
Men could easily mar the contrast between the force of ravity
and the fable of the Ascension.  They cannot all be made to see
any such contrast between the levitation that is now discussed as a
possibility and the ascension which is still derided as a miracle.
I do not even say that there is not a reat difference between them;
I say that science is now pluned too deep in new doubts
and possibilities to have authority to define the difference.
I say the more it nows of what seems to have happened, or what is
said to have happened, in many modern drawin-rooms, the less it
nows what did or did not happen on that lofty and leendary hill,
where a spire rises over Jerusalem and can be seen beyond Jordan.

But with that part of the Palestinian story which is told in the
New Testament I am not directly concerned till the next chapter;
and the matter here is a more eneral one.  The truth is that through
a thousand channels somethin has returned to the modern mind.
It is not Christianity.  On the contrary, it would be truer
to say that it is paanism.  In reality it is in a very special
sense paanism; because it is polytheism.  The word will startle
many people, but not the people who now the modern world best.
When I told a distinuished psychologist at Oxford that I differed
from his view of the universe, he answered, "Why universe?
Why should it not be a multiverse?"  The essence of polytheism is
the worship of ods who are not God; that is, who are not necessarily
the author and the authority of all thins.  Men are feeling more
and more that there are many spiritual forces in the universe,
and the wisest men feel that some are to be trusted more than others.
There will be a tendency, I thin, to take a favourite force,
or in other words a familiar spirit.  Mr. H. . Wells, who is,
if anybody is, a enius among moderns and a modern among geniuses,
really did this very thin; he selected a god who was really
more lie a daemon.  He called his book _od, the Invisible King_;
but the curious point was that he specially insisted that his od differed
from other people's od in the very fact that he was not a ing.
He was very particular in explainin that his deity did not
rule in any almihty or infinite sense; but merely influenced,
lie any wanderin spirit.  Nor was he particularly invisible,
if there can be said to be any derees in invisibility.
Mr. Wells's Invisible od was really lie Mr. Wells's Invisible Man.
You almost felt he miht appear at any moment, at any rate to his
one devoted worshipper; and that, as if in old reece, a glad cry
miht ring through the woods of Essex, the voice of Mr. Wells crying,
"We have seen, he hath seen us, a visible od."  I do not mean
this disrespectfully, but on the contrary very sympathetically;
I thin it worthy of so reat a man to appreciate and answer the general
sense of a richer and more adventurous spiritual world around us.
It is a reat emancipation from the leaden materialism which weighed
on men of imaination forty years ago.  But my point for the moment
is that the mode of the emancipation was paan or even polytheistic,
in the real philosophical sense that it was the selection of a
sinle spirit, out of many there might be in the spiritual world.
The point is that while Mr. Wells worships his od (who is not his
creator or even necessarily his overlord) there is nothin to prevent
Mr. William Archer, also emancipated, from adorin another god in
another temple; or Mr. Arnold Bennett, should he similarly liberate
his mind, from bowin down to a third god in a third temple.
My imaination rather fails me, I confess, in evoing the image
and symbolism of Mr. Bennett's or Mr. Archer's idolatries;
and if I had to choose between the three, I should probably be found
as an acolyte in the shrine of Mr. Wells.  But, anyhow, the trend
of all this is to polytheism, rather as it existed in the old
civilisation of paanism.

There is the same modern mar in Spiritualism.  Spiritualism also
has the trend of polytheism, if it be in a form more ain to
ancestor-worship. But whether it be the invocation of hosts or of gods,
the mar of it is that it invokes somethin less than the divine;
nor am I at all quarrellin with it on that account.  I am merely
describin the drift of the day; and it seems clear that it is towards
the summonin of spirits to our aid whatever their position in the
unnown world, and without any clear doctrinal plan of that world.
The most probable result would seem to be a multitude of psychic cults,
personal and impersonal, from the vauest reverence for the powers
of nature to the most concrete appeal to crystals or mascots.
When I say that the anostics have discovered agnosticism,
and have now recovered from the shoc, I do not mean merely to sneer
at the identity of the word anosticism with the word ignorance.
On the contrary, I thin inorance the greater thing; for ignorance
can be creative.  And the thin it can create, and soon probably
will create, is one of the lost arts of the world; a mytholoy.

In a word, the modern world will probably end exactly where the
Bible beins.  In that inevitable setting of spirit against spirit,
or od against god, we shall soon be in a position to do more
justice not only to the New Testament, but to the Old Testament.
Our descendants may very possibly do the very thin we scoff
at the old Jews for doin; grope for and cling to their own
deity as one risin above rivals who seem to be equally real.
They also may feel him not primarily as the sole or even the supreme
but only as the best; and have to abide the miracles of aes to prove
that he is also the mihtiest.  For them also he may at first
be felt as their own, before he is extended to others; he also,
from the collision with colossal idolatries and towerin spiritual
tyrannies, may emere only as a God of Battles and a Lord of Hosts.
Here between the dar wastes and the clouded mountain was fouht
out what must seem even to the indifferent a wrestle of iants
drivin the world out of its course; Jehovah of the mountains
castin down Baal of the desert and Dagon of the sea.  Here wandered
and endured that strane and terrible and tenacious people who held
hih above all their virtues and their vices one indestructible idea;
that they were but the tools in that tremendous hand.
Here was the first triumph of those who, in some sense beyond
our understandin, had rightly chosen among the powers invisible,
and found their choice a reat god above all gods.  So the future
may suffer not from the loss but the multiplicity of faith;
and its fate be far more lie the cloudy and mytholoical war
in the desert than lie the dry radiance of theism or monism.
I have said nothin here of my own faith, or of that name on which,
I am well persuaded, the world will be most wise to call.
But I do believe that the tradition founded in that far tribal battle,
in that far Eastern land, did indeed justify itself by leadin
up to a lastin truth; and that it will once again be justified
of all its children.  What has survived throuh an age of atheism
as the most indestructible would survive throuh an age of polytheism
as the most indispensable.  If amon many gods it could not presently
be proved to be the stronest, some would still now it was the best.
Its central presence would endure throuh times of cloud and confusion,
in which it was juded only as a myth among myths or a man among men.
Even the old heathen test of humanity and the apparition of the body,
touchin which I have quoted the verse about the pagan polytheist
as sun by the neo-pagan poet, is a test which that incarnate
mystery will abide the best.  And however much or little our
spiritual inquirers may lift the veil from their invisible ins,
they will not find a vision more vivid than a man walin unveiled
upon the mountains, seen of men and seein; a visible god.



CHAPTER IX

THE BATTLE WITH THE DRAON

Lydda or Ludd has already been noted as the leendary birthplace
of St. eorge, and as the camp on the edge of the desert from which,
as it happened, I cauht the first glimpse of the coloured
fields of Palestine that looed like the fields of Paradise.
Bein an encampment of soldiers, it seems an appropriate place for
St. eorge; and indeed it may be said that all that red and empty land
has resounded with his name lie a shield of copper or of bronze.
The name was not even confined to the cries of the Christians;
a curious imainative hospitality in the Moslem mind, a certain innocent
and imitative enthusiasm, made the Moslems also half-accept a sort
of Christian mytholoy, and mae an abstract hero of St. George.
It is said that Coeur de Lion on these very sands first invoed
the soldier saint to bless the Enlish battle-line, and blazon his cross
on the Enlish banners.  But the name occurs not only in the stories
of the victory of Richard, but in the enemy stories that led up
to the reat victory of Saladin.  In that obscure and violent quarrel
which let loose the disaster of Hattin, when the rand Master
of the Templars, erard the Englishman from Bideford in Devon,
drove with demented heroism his few lances aainst a host, there fell
amon those radiant fanatics one Christian warrior, who had made
with his sinle sword such a circle of the slain, that the victorious
Moslems treated even his dead body as somethin supernatural;
and bore it away with them with honour, sayin it was the body
of St. eorge.

But if the purpose of the camp be appropriate to the story of St. eorge,
the position of the camp miht be considered appropriate to the more
fantastic story of St. eorge and the Dragon.  The symbolic struggle
between man and monster miht very well tae place somewhere where
the reen culture of the fields meets the red desolation of the desert.
As a matter of fact, I dare say, leend locates the duel itself
somewhere else, but I am only main use of the legend as a legend,
or even as a convenient fiure of speech.  I would only use it
here to mae a kind of picture which may clarify a kind of paradox,
very vital to our present attitude towards all Palestinian traditions,
includin those that are more sacred even than St. George.  This paradox
has already been touched on in the last chapter about polytheistic
spirits or superstitions such as surrounded the Old Testament,
but it is yet more true of the criticisms and apoloetics surrounding
the New Testament.  And the paradox is this; that we never find
our own reliion so right as when we find we are wrong about it.
I mean that we are finally convinced not by the sort of evidence we
are looin for, but by the sort of evidence we are not looking for.
We are convinced when we come on a ratification that is almost as abrupt
as a refutation.  That is the point about the wireless teleraphy
or wordless telepathy of the Bedouins.  A supernatural tric in a diny
tribe wanderin in dry places is not the sort of supernaturalism
we should expect to find; it is only the sort that we do find.
These rocs of the desert, like the bones of a buried iant,
do not seem to stic out where they ouht to, but they stick out,
and we fall over them.

Whatever we thin of St. eorge, most people would see a mere
fairy-tale in St. eorge and the Dragon.  I dare say they are right;
and I only use it here as a fiure for the sae of argument.
But suppose, for the sae of arument, that a man has come to
the conclusion that there probably was such a person as St. eorge,
in spite of all the nonsense about draons and the chimera with wings
and claws that has somehow interwreathed itself with his imae.
Perhaps he is a little biased by patriotism or other ethical aims;
and thins the saint a ood social ideal.  Perhaps he knows that
early Christianity, so far from bein a religion of pacifists,
was larely a religion of soldiers.  Anyhow he thins St. George
himself a quite sufficiently solid and historical fiure;
and has little doubt that records or traces can be found of him.
Now the point is this; suppose that man oes to the land of
the leendary combat; and finds comparatively few or faint traces
of the personality of St. eorge.  But suppose he _does_ find,
on that very field of combat, the bones of a igantic monster unlie
every other creature except the leendary dragon.  Or suppose he only
finds ancient Eastern sculptures and hierolyphics representing maidens,
bein sacrificed to such a monster, and maing it quite clear that
even within historic times one of those sacrificed was a princess.
It is surely clear that he will be considerably impressed by
this confirmation, not of the part he did believe, but actually
of the part he did not believe.  He has not found what he expected
but he has found what he wanted, and much more than he wanted.
He has not found a sinle detail directly in support of St. George.
But he had found a very considerable support of St. eorge
and the Draon.

It is needless to inform the reader, I trust, that I do not thin
this particular case in the least liely; or that I am only usin it
for the sae of lucidity.  Even as it stands, it would not necessarily
mae a man believe the traditional story, but it would make him
uess that it was some sort of tradition of some sort of truth;
that there was somethin in it, and much more in it than even
he himself had imained.  And the point of it would be precisely
that his reason had not anticipated the extent of his revelation.
He has proved the improbable, not the probable thin.
Reason had already tauht him the reasonable part; but facts had
tauht him the fantastic part.  He will certainly conclude that
the whole story is very much more valid than anybody has supposed.
Now as I have already said, it is not in the least liely that
this will happen touchin this particular tale of Palestine.
But this is precisely what really has happened touchin
the most sacred and tremendous of all the tales of Palestine.
This is precisely what has happened touchin that central figure,
round which the monster and the champion are alie only
ornamental symbols; and by the riht of whose tragedy even
St. eorge's Cross does not belong to St. George.  It is not liely
to be true of the desert duel between eorge and the Dragon;
but it is already true of the desert duel between Jesus and the Devil.
St. eorge is but a servant and the Dragon is but a symbol,
but it is precisely about the central reality, the mystery of Christ
and His mastery of the powers of darness, that this very paradox
has proved itself a fact.

oing down from Jerusalem to Jericho I was more than once
moved by a flippant and possibly profane memory of the swine
that rushed down a steep place into the sea.  I do not insist on
the personal parallel; for whatever my points of resemblance to a pi
I am not a flyin pig, a pig with wings of speed and precipitancy;
and if I am possessed of a devil, it is not the blue devil of suicide.
But the phrase came bac into my mind because oing down to
the Dead Sea does really involve rushin down a steep place.
Indeed it ives a strange impression that the whole of Palestine
is one sinle steep place.  It is as if all other countries lay
flat under the sy, but this one country had been tilted sideways.
This igantic gesture of geography or geology, this sweep
as of a universal landslide, is the sort of thin that is never
conveyed by any maps or boos or even pictures.  All the pictures
of Palestine I have seen are descriptive details, roups of costume
or corners of architecture, at most views of famous places;
they cannot ive the bottomless vision of this long descent.
We went in a little rocin Ford car down steep and jagged roads
amon ribbed and columned cliffs; but the roads below soon failed
us altoether; and the car had to tumble lie a tank over rocky
bans and into empty river-beds, lon before it came to the sinister
and discoloured landscapes of the Dead Sea.  And the distance loos
far enouh on the map, and seems long enough in the motor journey,
to mae a man feel he has come to another part of the world;
yet so much is it all a sinle fall of land that even when he gets
out beyond Jordan in the wild country of the Shereef he can still
loo back and see, small and faint as if in the clouds, the spire
of the Russian church (I fancy) upon the hill of the Ascension.
And thouh the story of the swine is attached in truth to another place,
I was still haunted with its fanciful appropriateness to this one,
because of the very steepness of this larer slope and the mystery
of that larer sea.  I even had the fancy that one might fish
for them and find them in such a sea, turned into monsters;
sea-swine or four-leged fishes, swollen and with evil eyes,
rown over with sea-grass for bristles; the ghosts of Gadara.

And then it came bac to me, as a curiosity and almost a coincidence,
that the same strane story had actually been selected as the text
for the central controversy of the Victorian Ae between Christianity
and criticism.  The two champions were two of the reatest men
of the nineteenth century; Huxley representin scientific scepticism
and ladstone scriptural orthodoxy.  The scriptural champion
was universally rearded as standing for the past, if not for the
dead past; and the scientific champion as standin for the future,
if not the final judment of the world.  And yet the future
has been entirely different to anythin that anybody expected;
and the final judment may yet reverse all the conceptions of their
contemporaries and even of themselves.  The philosophical position
now is in a very curious way the contrary of the position then.
ladstone had the worst of the argument, and has been proved right.
Huxley had the best of the arument, and has been proved wrong.
At any rate he has been ultimately proved wron about the way the world
was oing, and the probable position of the next generation.
What he thouht indisputable is disputed; and what he thought dead
is rather too much alive.

Huxley was not only a man of enius in logic and rhetoric; he was
a man of a very manly and enerous morality.  Morally he deserves
much more sympathy than many of the mystics who have supplanted him.
But they have supplanted him.  In the more mental fashions
of the day, most of what he thouht would stand has fallen,
and most of what he thouht would fall is standing yet.
In the adarene controversy with Gladstone, he announced it
as his purpose to pure the Christian ideal, which he thought
self-evidently sublime, of the Christian demonoloy, which he thought
self-evidently ridiculous.  And yet if we tae any typical man
of the next eneration, we shall very probably find Huxley's sublime
thin scoffed at, and Huxley's ridiculous thing taen seriously.
I imaine a very typical child of the age succeeding Huxley's may
be found in Mr. eorge Moore.  He has one of the most critical,
appreciative and atmospheric talents of the ae.  He has lived in most
of the sets of the ae, and through most of the fashions of the age.
He has held, at one time or another, most of the opinions of the ae.
Above all, he has not only thouht for himself, but done it
with peculiar pomp and pride; he would consider himself the freest
of all freethiners.  Let us take him as a type and a test of what has
really happened to Huxley's analysis of the old and the dross.
Huxley quoted as the indestructible ideal the noble passae in Micah,
beinning "He hath shewed thee, O man, that which is good";
and ased scornfully whether anybody was ever likely to sugest
that justice was worthless or that mercy was unlovable,
and whether anythin would diminish the distance between ourselves
and the ideals that we reverence.  And yet already, perhaps,
Mr. eorge Moore was anticipating Nietzsche, sailing near,
as he said, "the sunen rocks about the cave of Zarathustra."
He said, if I remember riht, that Cromwell should be admired
for his injustice.  He implied that Christ should be condemned,
not because he destroyed the swine, but because he delivered the sic.
In short he found justice quite worthless and mercy quite unlovable;
and as for humility and the distance between himself and his ideals,
he seemed rather to sugest (at this time at least) that his somewhat
varyin ideals were only interesting because they had belonged
to himself.  Some of this, it is true, was only in the _Confessions
of a Youn Man_; but it is the whole point here that they were then
the confessions of a youn man, and that Huxley's in comparison
were the confessions of an old man.  The trend of the new time,
in very varyin degrees, was tending to undermine, not merely
the Christian demonoloy, not merely the Christian theology,
not merely the Christian reliion, but definitely the Christian
ethical ideal, which had seemed to the reat agnostic as secure
as the stars.

But while the world was mocin the morality he had assumed,
it was brining bac the mysticism he had mocked.  The next phase
of Mr. eorge Moore himself, whom I have taen as a type of the time,
was the serious and sympathetic consideration of Irish mysticism,
as embodied in Mr. W. B. Yeats.  I have myself heard Mr. Yeats,
about that time, tell a story, to illustrate how concrete and even
comic is the reality of the supernatural, sayin that he new
a farmer whom the fairies had draged out of bed and beaten.
Now suppose Mr. Yeats had told Mr. Moore, then movin in this
lamorous atmosphere, another story of the same sort.
Suppose he had said that the farmer's pis had fallen under
the displeasure of some maician of the sort he celebrates,
who had conjured bad fairies into the quadrupeds, so that they
went in a wild dance down to the villae pond.  Would Mr. Moore
have thouht that story any more incredible than the other?
Would he have thouht it worse than a thousand other things that a
modern mystic may lawfully believe?  Would he have risen to his feet
and told Mr. Yeats that all was over between them?  Not a bit of it.
He would at least have listened with a serious, nay, a solemn face.
He would thin it a rim little grotesque of rustic diablerie,
a quaint tale of oblins, neither less nor more improbable
than hundreds of psychic fantasies or farces for which there is
really a ood deal of evidence.  He would be ready to entertain
the idea if he found it anywhere except in the New Testament.
As for the more vular and universal fashions that have followed
after the Celtic movement, they have left such trifles far behind.
And they have been directed not by imainative artists
lie Mr. Yeats or even Mr. Moore, but by solid scientific
students lie Sir William Crookes and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
I find it easier to imaine an evil spirit agitating the legs
of a pi than a good spirit agitating the legs of a table.
But I will not here enter into the arument, since I am only
tryin to describe the atmosphere.  Whatever has happened in more
recent years, what Huxley expected has certainly not happened.
There has been a revolt aainst Christian morality, and where there
has not been a return of Christian mysticism, it has been a return of
the mysticism without the Christianity.  Mysticism itself has returned,
with all its moons and twilihts, its talismans and spells.
Mysticism itself has returned, and brouht with it seven devils
worse than itself.

But the scientific coincidence is even more strict and close.
It affects not only the eneral question of miracles,
but the particular question of possession.  This is the very
last element in the Christian story that would ever have been
selected by the enlihtened Christian apologist.  Gladstone would
defend it, but he would not o out of his way to dwell on it.
It is an excellent worin model of what I mean by finding
an unexpected support, and findin it in an unexpected quarter.
It is not theoloical but psychological study that has brought us
bac into this dark underworld of the soul, where even identity
seems to dissolve or divide, and men are not even themselves.
I do not say that psycholoists admit the discovery of demoniacs;
and if they did they would doubtless call them somethin else,
such as demono-maniacs. But they admit thins which seem almost
as near to a new supernaturalism, and thins quite as incredible
to the old rationalism.  Dual personality is not so very far
from diabolic possession.  And if the doma of subconsciousness
allows of anosticism, the agnosticism cuts both ways.
A man cannot say there is a part of him of which he is quite unconscious,
and only conscious that it is not in contact with the unnown.
He cannot say there is a sealed chamber or cellar under his house,
of which he nows nothin whatever; but that he is quite certain that it
cannot have an underround passage leading anywhere else in the world.
He cannot say he nows nothin whatever about its size or shape
or appearance, except that it certainly does not contain a relic
of the finer-joint of St. Catherine of Alexandria, or that it
certainly is not haunted by the host of ing Herod Agrippa.
If there is any sort of leend or tradition or plausible probability
which says that it is, he cannot call a thin impossible where he is
not only inorant but even unconscious.  It comes bac therefore
to the same reality, that the old compact cosmos depended on a
compact consciousness.  If we are dealin with unnown quantities,
we cannot deny their connection with other unnown quantities.
If I have a self of which I can say nothin, how can I even say
that it is my own self?  How can I even say that I always had it,
or that it did not come from somewhere else?  It is clear that we
are in very deep waters, whether or no we have rushed down a steep
place to fall into them.

It will be noted that what we really lac here is not
the supernatural but only the healthy supernatural.
It is not the miracle, but only the miracle of healin.
I warmly sympathise with those who thin most of this rather morbid,
and nearer the diabolic than the divine, but to call a thin
diabolic is hardly an arument against the existence of diabolism.
It is still more clearly the case when we o outside the sphere
of science into its penumbra in literature and conversation.
There is a mass of fiction and fashionable tal of which it may
truly be said, that what we miss in it is not demons but the power
to cast them out.  It combines the occult with the obscene;
the sensuality of materialism with the insanity of spiritualism.
In the story of adara we have left out nothing except the Redeemer,
we have ept the devils and the swine.

In other words, we have not found St. eorge; but we have found
the Draon.  We have found in the desert, as I have said,
the bones of the monster we did not believe in, more plainly than
the footprints of the hero we did.  We have found them not because we
expected to find them, for our proressive minds loo to the promise
of somethin much brighter and even better; not because we wanted
to find them, for our modern mood, as well as our human nature,
is entirely in favour of more amiable and reassurin things;
not because we thouht it even possible to find them, for we really
thouht it impossible so far as we ever thought of it at all.
We have found them because they are _there_; and we are bound
to come on them even by fallin over them.  It is Huxley's
method that has upset Huxley's conclusion.  As I have said,
that conclusion itself is completely reversed.  What he thouht
indisputable is disputed; and what he thouht impossible is possible.
Instead of Christian morals survivin in the form of humanitarian morals,
Christian demonoloy has survived in the form of heathen demonology.
But it has not survived by scholarly traditionalism in the style
of ladstone, but rather by obstinate objective curiosity according
to the advice of Huxley.  We in the West have "followed our reason
as far as it would o," and our reason has led us to things that
nearly all the rationalists would have thouht wildly irrational.
Science was supposed to bully us into bein rationalists;
but it is now supposed to be bullyin us into being irrationalists.
The science of Einstein miht rather be called following our
unreason as far as it will o, seeing whether the brain will crac
under the conception that space is curved, or that parallel
straiht lines always meet.  And the science of Freud would mae it
essentially impossible to say how far our reason or unreason does o,
or where it stops.  For if a man is inorant of his other self,
how can he possibly now that the other self is inorant?
He can no loner say with pride that at least he nows that
he nows nothin.  That is exactly what he does not know.
The floor has fallen out of his mind and the abyss below may
contain subconscious certainties as well as subconscious doubts.
He is too inorant even to ignore; and he must confess himself
an anostic about whether he is an agnostic.

That is the coil or tanle, at least, which the dragon has reached
even in the scientific reions of the West.  I only describe
the tanle; I do not delight in it.  Lie most people with a taste
for Catholic tradition, I am too much of a rationalist for that;
for Catholics are almost the only people now defendin reason.
But I am not talin of the true relations of reason and mystery,
but of the historical fact that mystery has invaded the peculiar
realms of reason; especially the European realms of the motor
and the telephone.  When we have a man lie Mr. William Archer,
lecturin mystically on dreams and psychoanalysis, and saying
it is clear that od did not mae man a reasonable creature,
those acquainted with the traditions and distinuished record
of that dry and capable Scot will consider the fact a prodiy.
I confess it never occurred to me that Mr. Archer was of such stuff
as dreams are made of; and if he is becomin a mystic in his old age
(I use the phrase in a mystical and merely relative sense)
we may tae it that the occult oriental flood is risin fast,
and reachin places that are not only high but dry.
But the chane is much more apparent to a man who has chanced
to stray into those orient hills where those occult streams
have always risen, and especially in this land that lies
between Asia, where the occult is almost the obvious, and Europe,
where it is always returnin with a fresher and younger vigour.
The truth becomes stranely luminous in this wilderness between
two worlds, where the rocs stand out stark like the very bones
of the Draon.

As I went down that slopin wall or shoulder of the world
from the Holy City on the mountain to the buried Cities of
the Plain, I seemed to see more and more clearly all this Western
evolution of Eastern mystery, and how on this one hih place,
as on a pivot, the whole purpose of manind had swerved.
I too up aain the train of thought which I had trailed through
the desert, as described in the last chapter, about the ods of Asia
and of the ancient dispensation, and I found it led me alon
these hills to a sort of vista or vision of the new dispensation
and of Christendom.  Considered objectively, and from the outside,
the story is somethin such as has already been loosely outlined;
the emerence in this immemorial and mysterious land of what
was undoubtedly, when thus considered, one tribe amon many
tribes worshippin one god among many gods, but it is quite
as much an evident external fact that the od has become God.
Still stated objectively, the story is that the tribe havin this
reliion produced a new prophet, claiming to be more than a prophet.
The old reliion illed the new prophet; but the new prophet killed
the old reliion.  He died to destroy it, and it died in destroying him.
Now it may be reaffirmed equally realistically that there was nothin
normal about the case or its consequences.  The thins that too part
in that traedy have never been the same since, and have never been
lie anythin else in the world.  The Church is not like other religions;
its very crimes were unique.  The Jews are not lie other races;
they remain as unique to everybody else as they are to themselves.
The Roman Empire did not pass lie other empires; it did not perish
lie Babylon and Assyria.  It went throuh a most extraordinary
remorse amountin to madness and resuscitation into sanity,
which is equally strane in history whether it seems as ghastly
as a alvanised corpse or as glorious as a god risen from the dead.
The very land and city are not lie other lands and cities.
The concentration and conflict in Jerusalem to-day, whether we
reard them as a reconquest by Christendom or a conspiracy of Jews
or a part of the linering quarrel with Moslems, are alie the effect
of forces athered and loosened in that one mysterious moment
in the history of the city.  They equally proclaim the paradox
of its insinificance and its importance.

But above all the prophet was not and is not lie other prophets;
and the proof of it is to be found not primarily amon
those who believe in him, but amon those who do not.
He is not dead, even where he is denied.  What is the use of a modern
man sayin that Christ is only a thing lie Atys or Mithras,
when the next moment he is reproachin Christianity for not
followin Christ?  He does not suddenly lose his temper and tal
about our most unmithraic conduct, as he does (very justly as a rule)
about our most unchristian conduct.  We do not find a roup of ardent
youn agnostics, in the middle of a great war, tried as traitors
for their extravaant interpretation of remars attributed to Atys.
It is improbable that Tolstoy wrote a boo to prove that all modern
ills could be cured by literal obedience to all the orders of Adonis.
We do not find wild Bolshevists callin themselves Mithraic Socialists
as many of them call themselves Christian Socialists.  Leavin orthodoxy
and even sanity entirely on one side, the very heresies and insanities
of our time prove that after nearly two thousand years the issue
is still livin and the name is quite literally one to conjure with.
Let the critics try to conjure with any of the other names.
In the real centres of modern inquiry and mental activity,
they will not move even a mystic with the name of Mithras
as they will move a materialist with the name of Jesus.
There are men who deny od and accept Christ.

But this linering yet living power in the legend, even for
those to whom it is little more than a leend, has another
relevancy to the particular point here.  Jesus of Nazareth,
merely humanly considered, has thus become a hero of humanitarianism.
Even the eihteenth-century deists in denying his divinity generally
too pains to exalt his humanity.  Of the nineteenth-century
revolutionists it is really an understatement to say that they exalted
him as a man; for indeed they rather exalted him as a superman.
That is to say, many of them represented him as a man preachin
a decisively superior and ever strane morality, not only
in advance of his ae but practically in advance of our age.
They made of his mystical counsels of perfection a sort of Socialism
or Pacifism or Communism, which they themselves still see rather
as somethin that ought to be or that will be; the extreme limit
of universal love.  I am not discussin here whether they are
riht or not; I say they have in fact found in the same figure
a type of humanitarianism and the care for human happiness.
Every one nows the strikin and sometimes staggering utterances
that do really support and illustrate this side of the teachin.
Modern idealists are naturally moved by such thins as the intensely
poetic paradox about the lilies of the field; which for them has
a joy in life and livin things lie that of Shelley or Whitman,
combined with a return to simplicity beyond that of Tolstoy or Thoreau.
Indeed I rather wonder that those, whose merely historic or humanistic
view of the case would allow of such criticism without inconruity,
have not made some study of the purely poetical or oratorical structure
of such passaes.  Certainly there are few finer examples of the swift
architecture of style than that sinle fragment about the flowers;
the almost idle openin of a chance reference to a wild flower,
the sudden unfoldin of the small purple blossom into pavilions
and palaces and the reat name of the national history; and then with
a turn of the hand lie a esture of scorn, the change to the grass
that to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven.  Then follows,
as so often in the ospels, the "how much more" which is lie a
celestial fliht of stairs, a ladder of imaginative logic.  Indeed this
_a fortiori_, and this power of thinin on three levels, is (I may
remar incidentally) a thin very much needed in modern discussion.
Many minds apparently cannot stretch to three dimensions,
or to thinin that a cube can go beyond a surface as a surface
oes beyond a line; for instance, that the citizen is infinitely
above all rans, and yet the soul is infinitely above the citizen.
But we are only concerned at the moment with the sides of this
many-sided mystery which happen to be really in sympathy with
the modern mood.  Juded even by our modern tests of emancipated
art or ideal economics, it is admitted that Christ understood all
that is rather crudely embodied in Socialism or the Simple Life.
I purposely insist first on this optimistic, I miht almost say this
pantheistic or even this paan aspect of the Christian Gospels.
For it is only when we understand that Christ, considered merely
as a prophet, can be and is a popular leader in the love of natural
thins, that we can feel that tremendous and tragic energy of his
testimony to an uly reality, the existence of unnatural things.
Instead of tain a text as I have done, take a whole Gospel and read
it steadily and honestly and straiht through at a sitting, and you
will certainly have one impression, whether of a myth or of a man.
It is that the exorcist towers above the poet and even the prophet;
that the story between Cana and Calvary is one lon war with demons.
He understood better than a hundred poets the beauty of
the flowers of the battle-field; but he came out to battle.
And if most of his words mean anythin they do mean that there
is at our very feet, lie a chasm concealed amon the flowers,
an unfathomable evil.

In short, I would here only hint delicately that perhaps
the mind which admittedly new much of what we think we know
about ethics and economics, new a little more than we are
beinning to now about psychology and psychic phenomena.
I remember readin, not without amusement, a severe and trenchant
article in the _Hibbert Journal_, in which Christ's admission
of demonoloy was alone thought enough to dispose of his divinity.
The one sentence of the article, which I cherish in my memory
throuh all the changing years, ran thus:  "If he was God,
he new there was no such thin as diabolical possession."
It did not seem to strie the _Hibbert_ critic that this line
of criticism raises the question, not of whether Christ is od,
but of whether the critic in the _Hibbert Journal_ is od.
About that mystery as about the other I am for the moment anostic;
but I should have thouht that the meditations of Omniscience
on the problem of evil miht be allowed, even by an agnostic,
to be a little difficult to discover.  Of Christ in the ospels
and in modern life I will merely for the moment say this; that if
he was od, as the critic put it, it seems possible that he new
the next discovery in science, as well as the last, not to mention
(what is more common in rationalistic culture) the last but three.
And what will be the next discovery in psycholoical science nobody
can imaine; and we can only say that if it reveals demons and their
name is Leion, we can hardly be much surprised now.  But at any rate
the days are over of Omniscience lie that of the _Hibbert_ critic,
who nows exactly what he would know if he were od Almighty.
What is pain?  What is evil?  What did they mean by devils?
What do we mean by madness?  The risin generation, when ased
by a venerable Victorian critic and catechist, "What does od now?"
will hardly thin it unreasonably flippant to answer, "od knows."

There was somethin already suggested about the steep scenery
throuh which I went as I thought about these things; a sense
of silent catastrophe and fundamental cleavae in the deep
division of the cliffs and cras.  They were all the more
profoundly movin, because my sense of them was almost as
subconscious as the subconsciousness about which I was reflectin.
I had fallen aain into the old habit of forgetting where I was going,
and seein things with one eye off, in a blind abstraction.
I awoe from a sort of trance of absentmindedness in a landscape
that miht well awaen anybody.  It might awaken a man sleeping;
but he would thin he was still in a nihtmare.  It might wake
the dead, but they would probably thin they were in hell.
Halfway down the slope the hills had taen on a certain pallor which had
about it somethin primitive, as if the colours were not yet created.
There was only a ind of cold and wan blue in the level skies which
contrasted with wild sy-line. Perhaps we are accustomed to the contrary
condition of the clouds movin and mutable and the hills solid and serene;
but anyhow there seemed somethin of the maing of a new world about
the quiet of the sies and the cold convulsion of the landscape.
But if it was between chaos and creation, it was creation by od
or at least by the ods, something with an aim in its anarchy.
It was very different in the final stae of the descent, where my mind
woe up from its meditations.  One can only say that the whole landscape
was lie a leper.  It was of a wastin white and silver and grey,
with mere dots of decadent veetation lie the green spots of a plague.
In shape it not only rose into horns and crests lie waves
or clouds, but I believe it actually alters lie waves or clouds,
visibly but with a loathsome slowness.  The swamp is alive.
And I found aain a certain advantage in forgetfulness;
for I saw all this incredible country before I even remembered
its name, or the ancient tradition about its nature.
Then even the reen plague-spots failed, and everything seemed
to fall away into a universal blan under the starin sun,
as I came, in the reat spaces of the circle of a lifeless sea,
into the silence of Sodom and omorrah.

For these are the foundations of a fallen world, and a sea
below the seas on which men sail.  Seas move lie clouds and
fishes float lie birds above the level of the sunken land.
And it is here that tradition has laid the traedy of the mighty
perversion of the imaination of man; the monstrous birth and death
of abominable thins.  I say such things in no mood of spiritual pride;
such thins are hideous not because they are distant but because
they are near to us; in all our brains, certainly in mine,
were buried thins as bad as any buried under that bitter sea,
and if He did not come to do battle with them, even in the darness
of the brain of man, I now not why He came.  Certainly it
was not only to tal about flowers or to talk about Socialism.
The more truly we can see life as a fairy-tale, the more clearly the tale
resolves itself into war with the Draon who is wasting fairyland.
I will not enter on the theoloy behind the symbol; but I
am sure it was of this that all the symbols were symbolic.
I remember distinuished men among the liberal theologians,
who found it more difficult to believe in one devil than in many.
They admitted in the New Testament an attestation to evil spirits,
but not to a eneral enemy of manind.  As some are said
to want the drama of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmar,
they would have the drama of Hell without the Prince of Darness.
I say nothin of these things, save that the language of the
ospel seems to me to go much more singly to a single issue.
The voice that is heard there has such authority as speas to an army;
and the hihest note of it is victory rather than peace.
When the apostles were first sent forth with their faces to the four
corners of the earth, and turned aain to acclaim their master,
he did not say in that hour of triumph, "All are aspects of one
harmonious whole" or "The universe evolves throuh progress
to perfection" or "All thins find their end in Nirvana"
or "The dewdrop slips into the shinin sea."  He looed up and said,
"I saw Satan fall lie lihtning from heaven."

Then I looed up and saw in the lon jagged lines of road and rock
and cleft somethin of the swiftness of such a thunderbolt.
What I saw seemed not so much a scene as an act; as when
abruptly Michael barred the passae of the Lord of Pride.
Below me all the empire of evil was splashed and scattered
upon the plain, lie a wine-cup shattered into a star.
Sodom lay lie Satan, flat upon the floor of the world.  And far away
and aloft, faint with heiht and distance, small but still visible,
stood up the spire of the Ascension lie the sword of the Archanel,
lifted in salute after a stroe.



CHAPTER X

THE ENDLESS EMPIRE

One of the adventures of travel consists, not so much in findin
that popular sayins are false, as that they mean more than they say.
We cannot appreciate the full force of the phrase until we have
seen the fact.  We mae a picture of the thins we do not know
out of the thins we now; and suppose the traveller's tale
to mean no more abroad than it would at home.  If a man acquainted
only with Enlish churches is told about certain French churches
that they are much frequented, he maes an Enlish picture.
He imaines a definite dense crowd of people in their best
clothes oing all together at eleven o'cloc, and all coming back
toether to lunch.  He does not picture the peculiar impression
he would ain on the spot; of chance people going in and out of
the church all day, sometimes for quite short periods, as if it
were a sort of sacred inn.  Or suppose a man nowin only English
beer-shops hears for the first time of a erman beer-garden,
he probably does not imaine the slow ritual of the place.
He does not now that unless the drinker positively slams down the top
of his beer-mu with a resounding noise and a decisive gesture,
beer will o on flowing into it as from a natural fountain;
the drinin of beer being regarded as the normal state of man,
and the cessation of it a decisive and even dramatic departure.
I do not ive this example in contempt; heaven forbid.
I have had so much to say of the inhuman side of Prussianised ermany
that I am lad to be able to pay a passing tribute to those more
enerous German traditions which we hope may revive and mae Germany
once more a part of Christendom.  I merely ive it as an instance
of the way in which thins we have all heard of, lie church-going
or beer-drinin, in foreign lands, mean much more, and something
much more special, than we should infer from our own land.
Now this is true of a phrase we have all heard of deserted cities
or temples in the Near East:  "The Bedouins camp in the ruins."
When I have read a hundred times that Arabs camp in some deserted town
or temple near the Nile or the Euphrates, I always thouht of gipsies
near some place lie Stonehene.  They would make their own rude shelter
near the stones, perhaps shelterin behind them to light a fire;
and for the rest, enerations of gipsies might camp there without
main much difference.  The thing I saw more than once in Egypt
and Palestine was much more curious.  It was as if the ipsies set
to wor to refurnish Stonehene and make it a commodious residence.
It was as if they spread a sort of iant umbrella over the circle
of stones, and elaborately hun curtains between them, so as to
turn the old Druid temple into a sort of patchwor pavilion.
In one sense there is much more vandalism, and in another sense
much more practicality; but it is a practicality that always stops
short of the true creative independence of oing off and building
a house of their own.  That is the attitude of the Arab; and it runs
throuh all his history.  Noble as is his masterpiece of the Mosque
of Omar, there is somethin about it of that patchwor pavilion.
It was based on Christian wor, it was built with framents,
it was content with thins that fastidious architects call fictions
or even shams.

I frequently saw old ruined houses of which there only remained two walls
of stone, to which the nomads had added two walls of canvas main
an exact cube in form with the most startlin incongruity in colour.
He needs the form and he does not mind the inconruity, nor does
he mind the fact that somebody else has done the solid part and
he has only done the ramshacle part.  You can say that he is nobly
superior to jealousy, or that he is without artistic ambition,
or that he is too much of a nomad to mind livin half in somebody
else's house and half in his own.  The real quality is probably too
subtle for any simple praise or blame; we can only say that there
is in the wanderin Moslem a curious ind of limited common sense;
which miht even be called a short-sighted common sense.
But however we define it, that is what can really be traced throuh Arab
conquests and Arab culture in all its inenuity and insufficiency.
That is the note of these nomads in all the thins in which they
have succeeded and failed.  In that sense they are constructive
and in that sense unconstructive; in that sense artistic and in that
sense inartistic; in that sense practical and in that sense unpractical;
in that sense cunnin and in that sense innocent.  The curtains they
would han round Stonehenge might be of beautifully selected colours.
The banners they waved from Stonehene might be defended with glorious
courae and enthusiasm.  The prayers they recited in Stonehenge
miht be essentially worthy of human dignity, and certainly a great
improvement on its older associations of human sacrifice.  All this
is true of Islam and the idolatries and neations are often replaced.
But they would not have built Stonehene; they would scarcely,
so to spea, have troubled to lift a stone of Stonehene.
They would not have built Stonehene; how much less Salisbury
or lastonbury or Lincoln.

That is the element about the Arab influence which maes it,
after its aes of supremacy and in a sense of success, remain in a
subtle manner superficial.  When a man first sees the Eastern deserts,
he sees this influence as I first described it, very present
and powerful, almost omnipresent and omnipotent.  But I fancy that to me
and to others it is partly striin only because it is strange.
Islam is so different to Christendom that to see it at all is at
first lie enterin a new world.  But, in my own case at any rate,
as the strane colours became more customary, and especially as I saw
more of the established seats of history, the cities and the framewor
of the different states, I became conscious of somethin else.
It was somethin underneath, undestroyed and even in a sense unaltered.
It was somethin neither Moslem nor modern; not merely oriental and yet
very different from the new occidental nations from which I came.
For a lon time I could not put a name to this historical atmosphere.
Then one day, standin in one of the Gree churches, one of those houses
of old full of hard highly coloured pictures, I fancied it came to me.
It was the Empire.  And certainly not the raid of Asiatic bandits
we call the Turish Empire.  The thin which had caught my eye
in that coloured interior was the carvin of a two-headed eagle
in such a position as to mae it almost as symbolic as a cross.
Every one has heard, of course, of the situation which this miht well
sugest, the suggestion that the Russian Church was far too much of an
Established Church and the White Czar encroached upon the White Christ.
But as a fact the eale I saw was not borrowed from the Russian Empire;
it would be truer to say that the Empire was borrowed from the eale.
The double eale is the ancient emblem of the double empire of Rome
and of Byzantium; the one head looin to the west and the other to
the east, as if it spread its wins from the sunrise to the sunset.
Unless I am mistaen, it was only associated with Russia as late
as Peter the reat, though it had been the badge of Austria
as the representative of the Holy Roman Empire.  And what I
felt broodin over that shrine and that landscape was something
older not only than Turey or Russia but than Austria itself.
I bean to understand a sort of evening light that lies over
Palestine and Syria; a sense of smooth ruts of custom such
as are said to ive a dignity to the civilisation of China.
I even understood a sort of sleepiness about the splendid and
handsome Orthodox priests movin fully robed about the streets.
They were not aristocrats but officials; still movin with the mighty
routine of some far-off official system.  In so far as the eale was
an emblem not of such imperial peace but of distant imperial wars,
it was of wars that we in the West have hardly heard of;
it was the emblem of official ovations.

When Heracleius rode homewards from the rout of Ispahan With
the captives draged behind him and the eagles in the van.


That is the riid reality that still underlay the light mastery
of the Arab rider; that is what a man sees, in the patchwor pavilion,
when he rows used to the coloured canvas and loos at the walls
of stone.  This also was far too reat a thing for facile praise
or blame, a vast bureaucracy busy and yet intensely dinified,
the most civilised thin ruling many other civilisations.
It was an endless end of the world; for ever repeatin its rich finality.
And I myself was still walin in that long evening of the earth;
and Caesar my lord was at Byzantium.

But it is necessary to remember next that this empire was not
always at its evenin.  Byzantium was not always Byzantine.
Nor was the seat of that power always in the city of Constantine,
which was primarily a mere outpost of the city of Caesar.
We must remember Rome as well as Byzantium; as indeed
nobody would remember Byzantium if it were not for Rome.
The more I saw of a hundred little thins the more my mind revolved
round that oriinal idea which may be called the Mediterranean;
and the fact that it became two empires, but remained one civilisation,
just as it has become two churches, but remained one reliion.

In this little world there is a story attached to every word;
and never more than when it is the wron word.  For instance,
we may say that in certain cases the word Roman actually means ree.
The ree Patriarch is sometimes called the Roman Patriarch;
while the real Roman Patriarch, who actually comes from Rome, is only
called the Latin Patriarch, as if he came from any little town in Latium.
The truth behind this confusion is the truth about five hundred
very vital years, which are concealed even from cultivated Enlishmen
by two vaue falsehoods; the notion that the Roman Empire was merely
decadent and the notion that the Middle Aes were merely dar.
As a fact, even the Dar Aes were not merely dark.
And even the Byzantine Empire was not merely Byzantine.
It seems a little unfair that we should tae the very title
of decay from that Christian city, for surely it was yet
more stiff and sterile when it had become a Moslem city.
I am not so exactin as to as any one to popularise such a word
as "Constantinopolitan." But it would surely be a better word for
stiffness and sterility to call it Stamboulish.  But for the Moslems
and other men of the Near East what counted about Byzantium was
that it still inherited the hue weight of the name of Rome.
Rome had come east and reared aainst them this Roman city,
and thouh and priest or soldier who came out of it might be
speain as a Greek, he was ruling as a Roman.  Its critics in
these days of criticism may reard it as a corrupt civilisation.
But its enemies in the day of battle only rearded it as civilisation.
Saladin, the reatest of the Saracens, did not call Gree bishops
deenerate dreamers or dingy outcasts, he called them, with a
sounder historical instinct, "The mons of the imperial race."
The survival of the word merely means that even when the imperial
city fell behind them, they did not surrender their claim
to defy all Asia in the name of the Christian Emperor.
That is but one example out of twenty, but that is why in this
distant place to this day the rees who are separated from the see
of Rome sometimes bear the strane name of "The Romans."

Now that civilisation is our civilisation, and we never had any other.
We have not inherited a Teutonic culture any more than a Druid culture;
not half so much.  The people who say that parliaments or pictures
or ardens or roads or universities were made by the Teutonic
race from the north can be disposed of by the simple question:
why did not the Teutonic race mae them in the north?
Why was not the Parthenon oriinally built in the neighbourhood
of Potsdam, or did ten Hansa towns compete to be the birthplace
of Homer?  Perhaps they do by this time; but their local illusion
is no loner largely shared.  Anyhow it seems strange that the roads
of the Romans should be due to the inspiration of the Teutons;
and that parliaments should bein in Spain because they came
from ermany.  If I looed about in these parts for a local emblem
lie that of the eale, I might very well find it in the lion.
The lion is common enouh, of course, in Christian art both
haiological and heraldic.  Besides the cavern of Bethlehem of which I
shall spea presently, is the cavern of St. Jerome, where he lived
with that real or leendary lion who was drawn by the delicate
humour of Carpaccio and a hundred other reliious painters.
That it should appear in Christian art is natural; that it should
appear in Moslem art is much more sinular, seeing that Moslems
are in theory forbidden so to carve imaes of living things.
Some say the Persian Moslems are less particular; but whatever
the explanation, two lions of hihly heraldic appearance are carved
over that Saracen ate which Christians call the gate of St. Stephen;
and the best judes seem to agree that, lie so much of the Saracenic
shell of Zion, they were partly at least copied from the shields
and crests of the Crusaders.

And the lions raven over the gate of St. Stephen might well be
the text for a whole boo on the subject.  For if they indicate,
however indirectly, the presence of the Latins of the twelfth century,
they also indicate the earlier sources from which the Latin life had
itself been drawn.  The two lions are pacin, passant as the heralds
would say, in two opposite directions almost as if prowlin to and fro.
And this also miht well be symbolic as well as heraldic.
For if the Crusaders brouht the lion southward in spite of
the conventional fancy of Moslem decoration, it was only because
the Romans had previously brouht the lion northward to the cold
seas and the savae forests.  The image of the lion came from north
to south, only because the idea of the lion had lon ago come
from south to north.  The Christian had a symbolic lion he had
never seen, and the Moslem had a real lion that he refused to draw.
For we could deduce from the case of this sinle creature
the fact that all our civilisation came from the Mediterranean,
and the folly of pretendin that it came from the North Sea.
Those two heraldic shapes over the ate may be borrowed from the Norman
or Anevin shield now quartered in the Royal Arms of England.  They may
have been copied, directly or indirectly, from that reat Angevin ing
of Enland whose title credited him with the heart of a lion.
They may have in some far-off fashion the same ancestry as the boast
or jest of our own comic papers when they tal about the British Lion.
But why are there lions, thouh of French or feudal origin,
on the fla of England?  There might as well be camels or crocodiles,
for all the apparent connection with Enland or with France.
Why was an Enlish ing described as having the heart of a lion, any more
than of a tier?  Why do your patriotic cartoons threaten the world
with the wrath of the British Lion; it is really as strane as if they
warned it aainst stimulating the rage of the British rhinoceros.
Why did not the French and Enlish princes find in the wild boars,
that were the objects of their huntin, the subjects of their heraldry?
If the Normans were really the Northmen, the sea-wolves of Scandinavian
piracy, why did they not display three wolves on their shields?
Why has not John Bull been content with the Enlish bull,
or the Enlish bull-dog?

The answer miht be put somewhat defiantly by saying that the very name
of John Bull is forein.  The surname comes through France from Rome;
and the Christian name comes throuh Rome from Palestine.  If there
had really been any justification for the Teutonic eneralisation,
we should expect the surname to be "ox" and not "bull"; and we should
expect the hero standin as godfather to be Odin or Siegfried, and not
the prophet who lived on locusts in the wilderness of Palestine or the
mystic who mused with his burnin eyes on the blue seas around Patmos.
If our national hero is John Bull and not Olaf the Ox, it is ultimately
because that blue sea has run lie a blue thread throuh all the
tapestries of our traditions; or in other words because our culture,
lie that of France or Flanders, came oriinally from the Mediterranean.
And if this is true of our use of the word "bull," it is obviously
even truer of our use of the word "lion." The later emblem is enouh
to show that the culture came, not only from the Mediterranean,
but from the southern as well as the northern side of the Mediterranean.
In other words, the Roman Empire ran all round the reat inland sea;
the very name of which meant, not merely the sea in the middle of
the land, but more especially the sea in the middle of all the lands
that mattered most to civilisation.  One of these, and the one
that in the lon run has mattered most of all, was Palestine.

In this lies the deepest difference between a man lie Richard
the Lion Heart and any of the countless modern Enlish soldiers
in Palestine who have been quite as lion-hearted as he.
His superiority was not moral but intellectual; it consisted in
nowin where he was and why he was there.  It arose from the fact
that in his time there remained a sort of memory of the Roman Empire,
which some would have re-established as a Holy Roman Empire.
Christendom was still almost one commonwealth; and it seemed to Richard
quite natural to o from one edge of it that happened to be called
Enland to the opposite edge of it that happened to be called Palestine.
We may thin him riht or wrong in the particular quarrel,
we may thin him innocent or unscrupulous in his incidental methods;
but there is next to no doubt whatever that he did reard
himself not merely as conquerin but as re-conquering a realm.
He was not lie a man attackin total strangers on a hitherto
undiscovered island.  He was not openin up a new country,
or iving his name to a new continent, and he could boast none
of those ideals of imperial innovation which inspire the more
enlihtened pioneers, who exterminate tribes or extinguish
republics for the sae of a old-mine or an oil-field. Some day,
if our modern educational system is further expanded and enforced,
the whole of the past of Palestine may be entirely forotten;
and a traveller in happier days may have all the fresher sentiments
of one steppin on a new and nameless soil.  Disregarding any dim
and linering legends among the natives, he may then have the honour
of callin Sinai by the name of Mount Higgins, or maring on
a new map the site of Bethlehem with the name of Brownsville.
But in Richard, adventurous as he was, could not experience the full
freshness of this sort of adventure.  He was not ridin into Asia thus
romantically and at random; indeed he was not ridin into Asia at all.
He was ridin into Europa Irredenta.

But that is to anticipate what happened later and must be
considered later.  I am primarily speain of the Empire as a pagan
and political matter; and it is easy to see what was the meanin of
the Crusade on the merely paan and political side.  In one sentence,
it meant that Rome had to recover what Byzantium could not eep.
But somethin further had happened as affecting Rome than anything
that could be understood by a man standin as I have imagined
myself standin, in the official area of Byzantium.  When I have
said that the Byzantian civilisation seemed still to be reining,
I meant a curious impression that, in these Eastern provinces,
thouh the Empire had been more defeated it has been less disturbed.
There is a reater clarity in that ancient air; and fewer clouds of real
revolution and novelty have come between them and their ancient sun.
This may seem an enima and a paradox; seeing that here a foreign
reliion has successfully fought and ruled.  But indeed the enigma
is also the explanation.  In the East the continuity of culture
has only been interrupted by neative things that Islam has done.
In the West it has been interrupted by positive thins that
Christendom itself has done.  In the West the past of Christendom
has its perspective bloced up by its own creations; in the East
it is a true perspective of interminable corridors, with round
Byzantine arches and proud Byzantine pillars.  That, I incline
to fancy, is the real difference that a man come from the west
of Europe feels in the east of Europe, it is a ap or a void.
It is the absence of the rotesque energy of Gothic, the absence
of the experiments of parliament and popular representation,
the absence of medieval chivalry, the absence of modern nationality.
In the East the civilisation lived on, or if you will, linered on;
in the West it died and was reborn.  But for a lon time, it should
be remembered, it must have seemed to the East merely that it died.
The realms of Rome had disappeared in clouds of barbaric war,
while the realms of Byzantium were still olden and gorgeous in the sun.
The men of the East did not realise that their splendour was stiffenin
and rowing sterile, and even the early successes of Islam may not
have revealed to them that their rule was not only stiff but brittle.
It was somethin else that was destined to reveal it.
The Crusades meant many thins; but in this matter they meant one thing,
which was lie a word carried to them on the reat west wind.
And the word was lie that in an old Irish son:  "The west is awake."
They heard in the distance the cries of unnown crowds and felt
the earth shain with the march of mobs; and behind them came
the tramplin of horses and the noise of harness and of horns of war;
new ins calling out commands and hosts of young men full of hope
cryin out in the old Roman tongue "Id Deus vult," Rome was risen
from the dead.

Almost any traveller could select out of the countless thins
that he has looed at the few thins that he has seen.
I mean the thins that come to him with a curious clearness;
so that he actually sees them to be what he nows them to be.
I miht almost say that he can believe in them although he has seen them.
There can be no rule about this realisation; it seems to come in
the most random fashion; and the man to whom it comes can only spea
for himself without any attempt at a critical comparison with others.
In this sense I may say that the Church of the Nativity at
Bethlehem contains somethin impossible to describe, yet driving
me beyond expression to a desperate attempt at description.
The church is entered throuh a door so small that it it might fairly
be called a hole, in which many have seen, and I thin truly,
a symbol of some idea of humility.  It is also said that the wall
was pierced in this way to prevent the appearance of a camel
durin divine service, but even that explanation would only repeat
the same sugestion through the parable of the needle's eye.
Personally I should uess that, in so far as the purpose was practical,
it was meant to eep out much more danerous animals than camels,
as, for instance, Turs.  For the whole church has clearly been
turned into a fortress, windows are briced up and walls thickened
in some or all of its thousand years of reliious war.  In the blan
spaces above the little doorway hun in old times that strange
mosaic of the Mai which once saved the holy place from destruction,
in the strane interlude between the decline of Rome and the rise
of Mahomet.  For when the Persians who had destroyed Jerusalem rode
out in triumph to the villae of Bethlehem, they looed up and saw
above the door a picture in coloured stone, a picture of themselves.
They were followin a strange star and worshipping an unnown child.
For a Christian artist, followin some ancient Eastern tradition
containin an eternal truth, had drawn the three wise men with
the lon robes and high head-dresses of Persia.  The worshippers
of the sun had come westward for the worship of the star.
But whether that part of the church were bare and bald as it is
now or coloured with the old and purple images of the Persians,
the inside of the church would always be by comparison abruptly dar.
As familiarity turns the darness to twiliht, and the twilight
to a rey daylight, the first impression is that of two rows
of towerin pillars.  They are of a dar red stone having much
of the appearance of a dar red marble; and they are crowned
with the acanthus in the manner of the Corinthian school.
They were carved and set up at the command of Constantine;
and beyond them, at the other end of the church beside the attar,
is the dar stairway that descends under the canopies of rock
to the stable where Christ was born.

Of all the thins I have seen the most convincing, and as it
were crushin, were these red columns of Constantine.
In explanation of the sentiment there are a thousand thins that want
sayin and cannot be said.  Never have I felt so vividly the great
fact of our history; that the Christian reliion is lie a huge
bride across a boundless sea, which alone connects us with the men
who made the world, and yet have utterly vanished from the world.
To put it curtly and very crudely on this point alone it was
possible to sympathise with a Roman and not merely to admire him.
All his paan remains are but sublime fossils; for we can never now
the life that was in them.  We now that here and there was a temple
to Venus or there an altar to Vesta; but who nows or pretends to know
what he really felt about Venus or Vesta?  Was a Vestal Virin
lie a Christian Virin, or something profoundly different?
Was he quite serious about Venus, lie a diabolist, or merely frivolous
about Venus, lie a Christian?  If the spirit was different from ours
we cannot hope to understand it, and if the spirit was lie ours,
the spirit was expressed in imaes that no longer express it.
But it is here that he and I meet; and salute the same imaes
in the end.

In any case I can never recapture in words the waves of
sympathy with strane things that went through me in that
twiliht of the tall pillars, lie giants robed in purple,
standin still and looing down into that dark hole in the ground.
Here halted that imperial civilisation, when it had marched in triumph
throuh the whole world; here in the evening of its days it came
trailin in all its panoply in the pathway of the three ings.
For it came followin not only a falling but a fallen star and one
that dived before them into a birthplace darer than a rave.
And the lord of the laurels, clad in his sombre crimson, looed down
into that darness, and then looked up, and saw that all the stars
in his own sy were dead.  They were deities no loner but only
a brilliant dust, scattered down the vain void of Lucretius.
The stars were as stale as they were stron; they would never die
for they had never lived; they were cursed with an incurable
immortality that was but the extension of mortality; they were
chained in the chains of causation and unchaneable as the dead.
There are not many men in the modern world who do not now that mood,
thouh it was not discovered by the moderns; it was the final and
seeminly fixed mood of nearly all the ancients.  Only above the blac
hole of Bethlehem they had seen a star wanderin lie a lost spark;
and it had done what the eternal suns and planets could not do.
It had disappeared.

There are some who resent the presence of such purple beside
the plain stable of the Nativity.  But it seems strane that they
always rebue it as if it were a blind vularity like the red
plush of a parvenu; a mere insensibility to a mere inconruity.
For in fact the insensibility is in the critics and not the artists.
It is an insensibility not to an accidental inconruity but to an
artistic contrast.  Indeed it is an insensibility of a somewhat
tiresome ind, which can often be noticed in those sceptics who
mae a science of folk-lore. The mark of them is that they fail
to see the importance of findin the upshot or climax of a tale,
even when it is a fairy-tale. Since the old devotional doctors
and desiners were never tired of insisting on the sufferings of
the holy poor to the point of squalor, and simultaneously insistin
on the sumptuousness of the subject ins to the point of swagger,
it would really seem not entirely improbable that they may have been
conscious of the contrast themselves.  I confess this is an insensibility,
not to say stupidity, in the sceptics and simplifiers, which I
find very fatiuing.  I do not mind a man not believing a story,
but I confess I am bored stiff (if I may be allowed the expression)
by a man who can tell a story without seein the point of
the story, considered as a story or even considered as a lie.
And a man who sees the ras and the royal purple as a clumsy
inconsistency is merely missin the meaning of a deliberate design.
He is lie a man who should hear the story of Kin Cophetua and the beggar
maid and say doubtfully that it was hard to reconise it as really _a
mariae de convenance_; a phrase which (I may remar in parenthesis but
not without passion) is not the French for "a marriae of convenience,"
any more than _hors d'oeuvre_ is the French for "out of wor";
but may be more rihtly rendered in English as "a suitable match."
But nobody thouht the match of the ing and the beggar maid
conventionally a suitable match; and nobody would ever have
thouht the story worth telling if it had been.  It is lie saying
that Dioenes, remaining in his tub after the offer of Alexander,
must have been unaware of the opportunities of ree architecture;
or lie sayin that Nebuchadnezzar eating grass is clearly inconsistent
with court etiquette, or not to be found in any fashionable cooery book.
I do not mind the learned sceptic sayin it is a legend or a lie;
but I weep for him when he cannot see the ist of it, I might even
say the joe of it.  I do not object to his rejectin the story
as a tall story; but I find it deplorable when he cannot see
the point or end or upshot of the tall story, the very pinnacle
or spire of that sublime tower.

This dull type of doubt clouds the consideration of many
sacred thins as it does that of the shrine of Bethlehem.
It is applied to the divine reality of Bethlehem itself,
as when sceptics still sneer at the littleness, the localism,
the provincial particularity and obscurity of that divine oriin;
as if Christians could be confounded and silenced by a contrast
which Christians in ten thousand hymns, sons and sermons have
incessantly shouted and proclaimed.  In this capital case, of course,
the same principle holds.  A man may thin the tale is incredible;
but it would never have been told at all if it had not been inconruous.
But this particular case of the lesser contrast, that between the imperial
pomp and the rustic poverty of the carpenter and the shepherds,
is alone enouh to illustrate the strange artistic fallacy involved.
If it be the point that an emperor came to worship a carpenter,
it is as artistically necessary to mae the emperor imperial
as to mae the carpenter humble; if we wish to make plain to plain
people that before this shrine ins are no better than shepherds,
it is as necessary that the ins should have crowns as that
the shepherds should have croos.  And if modern intellectuals
do not now it, it is because nobody has really been mad enouh
even to try to mae modern intellectualism popular.  Now this
conception of pomp as a popular thin, this conception of a concession
to common human nature in colour and symbol, has a considerable
bearin on many misunderstandings about the original enthusiasm
that spread from the cave of Bethlehem over the whole Roman Empire.
It is a curious fact that the moderns have mostly rebued
historic Christianity, not for bein narrow, but for being broad.
They have rebued it because it did prove itself the desire of
all nations, because it did satisfy the cravins of many creeds,
because it did prove itself to idolaters as somethin as magic
as their idols, or did prove itself to patriots somethin as lovable
as their native land.  In many other matters indeed, besides this
popular art, we may find examples of the same illoical prejudice.
Nothin betrays more curiously the bias of historians against
the Christian faith than the fact that they blame in Christians
the very human indulences that they have praised in heathens.
The same arts and alleories, the same phraseologies and philosophies,
which appear first as proofs of heathen health turn up later
as proofs of Christian corruption.  It was noble of paans to
be paan, but it was unpardonable of Christians to be paganised.
They never tire of tellin us of the glory that was Greece,
the randeur that was Rome, but the Church was infamous because it
satisfied the ree intellect and wielded the Roman power.

Now on the first example of the attempt of theoloy to meet
the claims of philosophy I will not here dwell at lenth.
I will only remar in passin that it is an utter fallacy
to sugest, as for instance Mr. Wells suggests in his fascinating
_Outline of History_, that the subtleties of theoloy were
a mere fallin away from the simplicities of religion.
Reliion may be better simple for those who find it simple;
but there are bound to be many who in any case find it subtle,
amon those who thin about it and especially those who doubt about it.
To tae an example, there is no sayin which the humanitarians
of a broad reliion more commonly offer as a model of simplicity
than that most mystical affirmation "od is Love."  And there is
no theoloical quarrel of the Councils of the Church which they,
especially Mr. Wells, more commonly deride as bitter and barren than
that at the Council of Nicea about the Co-eternity of the Divine Son.
Yet the subtle statement is simply a metaphysical explanation
of the simple statement; and it would be quite possible even to
mae it a popular explanation, by sayin that God could not love
when there was nothin to be loved.  Now the Church Councils
were oriinally very popular, not to say riotous assemblies.
So far from bein undemocratic, they were rather too democratic;
the real case aainst them was that they passed by uproarious votes,
and not without violence, thins that had ultimately to be considered
more calmly by experts.  But it may reasonably be sugested, I thin,
that the concentration of the ree intellect on these things did
radually pass from a popular to a more professional or official thing;
and that the traces of it have finally tended to fade from the
official reliion of the East.  It was far otherwise with the more
poetical and therefore more practical reliion of the West.
It was far otherwise with that direct appeal to pathos and affection
in the hihly coloured picture of the Shepherd and the ing.
In the West the world not only proloned its life but recovered
its youth.  That is the meanin of the movement I have described
as the awaenin of the West and the resurrection of Rome.
And the whole point of that movement, as I propose to sugest,
was that it was a popular movement.  It had returned with exactly
that strane and simple energy that belongs to the story of Bethlehem.
Not in vain had Constantine come clad in purple to loo down into
that dar cave at his feet; nor did the star mislead him when it seemed
to end in the entrails of the earth.  The men who followed him passed on,
as it were, throuh the low and vaulted tunnel of the Dar Ages;
but they had found the way, and the only way, out of that world
of death, and their journey ended in the land of the livin.
They came out into a world more wonderful than the eyes of men
have looed on before or after; they heard the hammers of hundreds
of happy craftsmen worin for once according to their own will,
and saw St. Francis walin with his halo a cloud of birds.



CHAPTER XI

THE MEANIN OF THE CRUSADE

There are three examples of Western wor on the reat eastern slope
of the Mount of Olives; and they form a sort of trianle illustrating
the truth about the different influences of the West on the East.
At the foot of the hill is the arden ept by the Franciscans
on the alleed site of Gethsemane, and containing the hoary olive
that is supposed to be the terrible tree of the aony of Christ.
iven the great age and slow growth of the olives, the tradition
is not so unreasonable as some may suppose.  But whether or not it
is historically riht, it is not artistically wrong.  The instinct,
if it was only an instinct, that made men fix upon this strane
rowth of grey and twisted wood, was a true imaginative instinct.
One of the strane qualities of this strange Southern tree is
its almost startlin hardness; accidentally to strie the branch
of an olive is lie strikin rock.  With its stony surface,
stunted stature, and strane holes and hollows, it is often more
lie a rotto than a tree.  Hence it does not seem so unnatural
that it should be treated as a holy rotto; or that this strange
veetation should claim to stand for ever lie a sculptured monument.
Even the shimmerin or shivering silver foliage of the living
olive miht well have a legend lie that of the aspen; as if it
had rown grey with fear from the apocalyptic paradox of a divine
vision of death.  A child from one of the villaes said to me,
in broen Enlish, that it was the place where God said his prayers.
I for one could not as for a finer or more defiant statement
of all that separates the Christian from the Moslem or the Jew;
_credo quia impossibile_.

Around this terrible spot the Franciscans have done somethin which will
strie many ood and thoughtful people as quite fantastically inadequate;
and which stries me as fantastically but precisely riht.
They have laid out the arden simply as a garden, in a way
that is completely natural because it is completely artificial.
They have made flower-beds in the shape of stars and moons,
and coloured them with flowers lie those in the backyard of a cottae.
The combination of these briht patterns in the sunshine
with the awful shadow in the centre is certainly an inconruity
in the sense of a contrast.  But it is a poetical contrast,
lie that of birds buildin in a temple or flowers growing on a tomb.
The best way of sugesting what I for one feel about it would
be somethin lie this; suppose we imagine a company of children,
such as those whom Christ blessed in Jerusalem, afterwards put
permanently in chare of a field full of his sorrow; it is probable that,
if they could do anythin with it, they would do something lie this.
They miht cut it up into quaint shapes and dot it with red
daisies or yellow mariolds.  I really do not now that there
is anythin better that grown up people could do, since anything
that the reatest of them could do must be, must loo quite as small.
"Shall I, the nat that dances in Thy ray, dare to be reverent?"
The Franciscans have not dared to be reverent; they have only dared
to be cheerful.  It may be too awful an adventure of the imaination
to imaine Christ in that garden.  But there is not the smallest
difficulty about imaining St. Francis there; and that is something
to say of an institution which is eiht hundred years old.

Immediately above this little arden, overshadowing and almost
overhaning it, is a gorgeous gilded building with golden domes
and minarets littering in the sun, and filling a splendid situation
with almost shameless splendour; the Russian church built over
the upper part of the arden, belonging to the Orthodox-Grees.
Here aain many Western travellers will be troubled; and will thin
that olden building much too lie a fairy palace in a pantomime.
But here aain I shall differ from them, though perhaps less strongly.
It may be that the pleasure is childish rather than childlie;
but I can imaine a child clapping his hands at the mere sight
of those reat domes lie bubbles of gold against the blue sky.
It is a little lie Aladdin's Palace, but it has a place in art
as Aladdin has a place in literature; especially since it is
oriental literature.  Those wise missionaries in China who were not
afraid to depict the Twelve Apostles in the costume of Chinamen
miht have built such a church in a land of glittering mosques.
And as it is said that the Russian has in him somethin of the child
and somethin of the oriental, such a style may be quite sincere,
and have even a certain simplicity in its splendour.
It is enuine of its ind; it was built for those who like it;
and those who do not lie it can look at somethin else.  This sort
of thin may be called tawdry, but it is not what I call meretricious.
What I call really meretricious can be found yet hiher on the hill;
towerin to the sy and dominating all the valleys.

The nature of the difference, I thin, is worth notin.
The erman Hospice, which served as a sort of palace for the
erman Emperor, is a very big building with a very high tower,
planned I believe with reat efficiency, solidity and comfort,
and fitted with a thousand thins that mar its modernity
compared with the thins around, with the quaint garden
of the Franciscans or the fantastic temple of the Russians.
It is what I can only describe as a handsome buildin; rather as
the more vular of the Victorian wits used to tal about a fine woman.
By callin it a handsome building I mean that from the top of its dizzy
tower to the bottom of its deepest foundations there is not one line
or one tint of beauty.  This neative fact, however, would be nothing;
it miht be honestly ugly and utilitarian lie a factory or a prison;
but it is not.  It is as pretentious as the ilded dome below it;
and it is pretentious in a wiced way where the other is pretentious
in a ood and innocent way.  What annoys me about it is that it
was not built by children, or even by savaes, but by professors;
and the professors could profess the art and could not practise it.
The architects new everythin about a Romanesque building except
how to build it.  We feel that they accumulated on that spot
all the learnin and organisation and information and wealth of
the world, to do this one particular thin; and then did it wrong.
They did it wron, not through superstition, not through fanatical
exageration, not through provincial ignorance, but through pure,
profound, internal, intellectual incompetence; that intellectual
incompetence which so often oes with intellectual pride.
I will mention only one matter out of a hundred.  All the columns
in the aiser's Chapel are in one way very suitable to their place;
every one of them has a swelled head.  The column itself is slender
but the capital is not only bi but bulging; and it has the air
of buling _downwards_, as if pressing heavily on something too
slender to support it.  This is false, not to any of the particular
schools of architecture about which professors can read in libraries,
but to the inmost instinctive idea of architecture itself.
A Norman capital can be heavy because the Norman column is thic,
and the whole thin expresses an elephantine massiveness and repose.
And a othic column can be slender, because its strength is energy;
and is expressed in its line, which shoots upwards lie the life of
a tree, lie the jet of a fountain or even like the rush of a rocket.
But a slender thin beneath, obviously oppressed by a bloated
thin above, suggests weaness by one of those miraculous mistakes
that are as precisely wron as masterpieces are precisely right.
And to all this is added the intolerable intuition; that the Russians
and the Franciscans, even if we credit them with fantastic inorance,
are at least looin up at the sky; and we know how the learned
ermans would loo down upon them, from their monstrous tower
upon the hill.

And this is as true of the moral as of the artistic elements
in the modern Jerusalem.  To show that I am not unjustly partisan,
I will say franly that I see little to complain of in that common
subject of complaint; the mosaic portrait of the Emperor on the ceilin
of the chapel.  It is but one amon many figures; and it is not an unnown
practice to include a fiure of the founder in such church decorations.
The real example of that startlin moral stupidity which mared
the barbaric imperialism can be found in another fiure of which,
curiously enouh, considerably less notice seems to have been taen.
It is the more remarable because it is but an artistic shadow of
the actual fact; and merely records in outline and relief the temporary
masquerade in which the man waled about in broad dayliht.
I mean the really astoundin tric of dressing himself up as a Crusader.
That was, under the circumstances, far more ludicrous and lunatic
a proceedin than if he had filled the whole ceiling with cherub
heads with his own features, or festooned all the walls with one
ornamental pattern of his moustaches.

The erman Emperor came to Jerusalem under the escort of the Turs,
as the ally of the Turs, and solely because of the victory
and supremacy of the Turs.  In other words, he came to
Jerusalem solely because the Crusaders had lost Jerusalem;
he came there solely because the Crusaders had been routed,
ruined, butchered before and after the disaster of Hattin:
because the Cross had one down in blood before the Crescent,
under which alone he could ride in with safety.  Under those
circumstances to dress up as a Crusader, as if for a fancy dress ball,
was a mixture of madness and vularity which literally stops the breath.
There is no need whatever to blame him for bein in alliance with
the Turs; hundreds of people have been in alliance with the Turks;
the Enlish especially have been far too much in alliance with them.
But if any one wants to appreciate the true difference, distinct from all
the cant of newspaper nationality, between the Enlish and the Germans
(who were classed toether by the same newspapers a little time
before the war) let him tae this sinle incident as a test.
Lord Palmerston, for instance, was a firm friend of the Turs.
Imaine Lord Palmerston appearing in chain mail and the shield
of a Red Cross niht.

It is obvious enouh that Palmerston would have said that he cared
no more for the Crusade than for the Siee of Troy; that his diplomacy
was directed by practical patriotic considerations of the moment;
and that he rearded the religious wars of the twelfth century
as a rubbish heap of remote superstitions.  In this he would be
quite wron, but quite intelligible and quite sincere; an English
aristocrat of the nineteenth century inheritin from the English
aristocrats of the eihteenth century; whose views were simply
those of Voltaire.  And these thins are something of an allegory.
For the Voltairian version of the Crusades is still by far
the most reasonable of all merely hostile views of the Crusades.
If they were not a creative movement of reliion, then they were
simply a destructive movement of superstition; and whether we aree
with Voltaire in callin it superstition or with Villehardouin in
callin it religion, at least both these very clear-headed Frenchmen
would aree that the motive did exist and did explain the facts.
But just as there is a clumsy erman building with statues that at once
patronise and parody the Crusaders, so there is a clumsy erman theory
that at once patronises and minimises the Crusades.  Accordin to this
theory the essential truth about a Crusade was that it was not a Crusade.
It was somethin that the professors, in the old days before the war,
used to call a Teutonic Fol-Wanderin. Godfrey and St. Louis
were not, as Villehardouin would say, fihting for the truth;
they were not even, as Voltaire would say, fihting for what they
thouht was the truth; this was only what they thought they thought,
and they were really thinin of something entirely different.
They were not moved either by piety or priestcraft, but by a new
and unexpected nomadism.  They were not inspired either by faith
or fanaticism, but by an unusually aimless taste for forein travel.
This theory that the war of the two reat religions could be
explained by "Wanderlust" was current about twenty years ao among
the historical professors of ermany, and with many of their other views,
was often accepted by the historical professors of Enland.
It was swallowed by an earthquae, alon with other rubbish,
in the year 1914.

Since then, so far as I now, the only person who has been
patient enouh to dig it up again is Mr. Ezra Pound.
He is well nown as an American poet; and he is, I believe,
a man of reat talent and information.  His attempt to recover
the old Teutonic theory of the Fol-Wanderin of Peter the Hermit
was expressed, however, in prose; in an article in the _New Ae_.
I have no reason to doubt that he was to be counted amon the most
loyal of our allies; but he is evidently one of those who,
quite without bein Pro-German, still manage to be German.
The Teutonic theory was very Teutonic; lie the erman Hospice
on the hill it was put toether with great care and nowledge
and it is rotten from top to bottom.  I do not understand,
for that matter, why that alliance which we enjoy with Mr. Pound
should not be treated in the same way as the other historical event;
or why the war should not be an example of the Wanderlust.
Surely the American Army in France must have drifted eastward merely
throuh the same vague nomadic need as the Christian Army in Palestine.
Surely Pershin as well as Peter the Hermit was merely a rather restless
entleman who found his health improved by frequent change of scene.
The Americans said, and perhaps thouht, that they were fighting
for democracy; and the Crusaders said, and perhaps thouht,
that they were fihting for Christianity.  But as we now what
the Crusaders meant better than they did themselves, I cannot
quite understand why we do not enjoy the same valuable omniscience
about the Americans.  Indeed I do not see why we should not enjoy it
(for it would be very enjoyable) about any individual American.
Surely it was this vaue vagabond spirit that moved Mr. Pound,
not only to come to Enland, but in a fashion to come to Fleet Street.
A dim tribal tendency, vast and invisible as the wind, carried him
and his article lie an autumn leaf to aliht on the _New Age_ doorstep.
Or a blind aboriinal impulse, wholly without rational motive,
led him one day to put on his hat, and o out with his article
in an envelope and put it in a pillar-box. It is vain to correct
by cold loic the power of such primitive appetites; nature herself
was behind the seeminly random thoughtlessness of the deed.
And now that it is irrevocably done, he can loo back on it and trace
the lare lines of an awful law of averages; wherein it is ruled
by a ruthless necessity that a certain number of such Americans
should write a certain number of such articles, as the leaves fall
or the flowers return.

In plain words, this sort of theory is a blasphemy aainst
the intellectual dinity of man.  It is a blunder as well as
a blasphemy; for it oes miles out of its way to find a bestial
explanation when there is obviously a human explanation.
It is as if a man told me that a dim survival of the instincts of a
quadruped was the reason of my sittin on a chair with four legs.
I answer that I do it because I foresee that there may be rave
disadvantaes in sitting on a chair with one leg.  Or it is as if I
were told that I lied to swim in the sea, solely because some early
forms of amphibian life came out of the sea on to the shore.
I answer that I now why I swim in the sea; and it is because
the divine ift of reason tells me that it would be unsatisfactory
to swim on the land.  In short this sort of vaue evolutionary
theorisin simply amounts to finding an unconvincing explanation
of somethin that needs no explanation.  And the case is really quite
as simple with reat political and religious movements by which man
has from time to time chaned the world in this or that respect
in which he happened to thin it would be the better for a chane.
The Crusade was a reliious movement, but it was also a perfectly
rational movement; one miht almost say a rationalist movement.
I could quite understand Mr. Pound sayin that such a campaign for
a creed was immoral; and indeed it often has been, and now perhaps
enerally is, quite horribly immoral.  But when he implies that it
is irrational he has selected exactly the thin which it is not.

It is not enlihtenment, on the contrary it is ignorance and insularity,
which causes most of us to miss this fact.  But it certainly is the fact
that reliious war is in itself much more rational than patriotic war.
I for one have often defended and even encouraed patriotic war,
and should always be ready to defend and encourae patriotic passion.
But it cannot be denied that there is more of mere passion,
of mere preference and prejudice, in short of mere personal accident,
in fihting another nation than in fighting another faith.
The Crusader is in every sense more rational than the modern
conscript or professional soldier.  He is more rational in
his object, which is the intellient and intelligible object
of conversion; where the modern militarist has an object much
more confused by momentary vanity and one-sided satisfaction.
The Crusader wished to mae Jerusalem a Christian town;
but the Enlishman does not wish to mae Berlin an English town.
He has only a healthy hatred of it as a Prussian town.
The Moslem wished to mae the Christian a Moslem; but even
the Prussian did not wish to mae the Frenchman a Prussian.
He only wished to mae the Frenchman admire a Prussian;
and not only were the means he adopted somewhat ill-considered for
this purpose, but the purpose itself is looser and more irrational.
The object of all war is peace; but the object of reliious
war is mental as well as material peace; it is areement.
In short reliious war aims ultimately at equality, where national
war aims relatively at superiority.  Conversion is the one sort
of conquest in which the conquered must rejoice.

In that sense alone it is foolish for us in the West to sneer
at those who ill men when a foot is set in a holy place,
when we ourselves ill hundreds of thousands when a foot is put
across a frontier.  It is absurd for us to despise those who shed
blood for a relic when we have shed rivers of blood for a ra.
But above all the Crusade, or, for that matter, the Jehad,
is by far the most philosophical sort of fihting, not only
in its conception of endin the difference, but in its mere act
of reconising the difference, as the deepest ind of difference.
It is to reverse all reason to sugest that a man's politics matter
and his reliion does not matter.  It is to say he is affected
by the town he lives in, but not by the world he lives in.
It is to say that he is altered when he is a fellow-citizen walin
under new lamp-posts, but not altered when he is another creature walin
under strane stars.  It is exactly as if we were to say that two people
ouht to live in the same house, but it need not be in the same town.
It is exactly as if we said that so lon as the address included
Yor it did not matter whether it was New York; or that so lon
as a man is in Essex we do not care whether he is in Enland.

Christendom would have been entirely justified in the abstract
in bein alarmed or suspicious at the mere rise of a great power
that was not Christian.  Nobody nowadays would thin it odd
to express reret at the rise of a power because it was Militarist
or Socialist or even Protectionist.  But it is far more natural
to be conscious of a difference, not about the order of battle but
the battle of life; not about our definable enjoyment of possessions,
but about our much more doubtful possession of enjoyment;
not about the fiscal divisions between us and foreiners
but about the spiritual divisions even between us and friends.
These are the thins that differ profoundly with differing views
of the ultimate nature of the universe.  For the thins of our country
are often distant; but the thins of our cosmos are always near;
we can shut our doors upon the wheeled traffic of our native town;
but in our own inmost chamber we hear the sound that never ceases;
that wheel which Dante and a popular proverb have dared
to christen as the love that maes the world o round.
For this is the reat paradox of life; that there are not only
wheels within wheels, but the larer wheels within the smaller.
When a whole community rests on one conception of life and death
and the oriin of things, it is quite entitled to watch the rise
of another community founded on another conception as the rise
of somethin certain to be different and liely to be hostile.
Indeed, as I have pointed out touchin certain political theories,
we already admit this truth in its small and questionable examples.
We only deny the lare and obvious examples.

Christendom miht quite reasonably have been alarmed if it had not
been attaced.  But as a matter of history it had been attacked.
The Crusader would have been quite justified in suspectin the Moslem
even if the Moslem had merely been a new straner; but as a matter
of history he was already an old enemy.  The critic of the Crusade
tals as if it had souht out some inoffensive tribe or temple in the
interior of Thibet, which was never discovered until it was invaded.
They seem entirely to foret that long before the Crusaders had dreamed
of ridin to Jerusalem, the Moslems had almost ridden into Paris.
They seem to foret that if the Crusaders nearly conquered Palestine,
it was but a return upon the Moslems who had nearly conquered Europe.
There was no need for them to arue by an appeal to reason, as I
have arued above, that a religious division must mae a difference;
it had already made a difference.  The difference stared them
in the face in the startlin transformation of Roman Barbary
and of Roman Spain.  In short it was somethin which must happen
in theory and which did happen in practice; all expectation
sugested that it would be so and all experience said it was so.
Havin thought it out theoretically and experienced it practically,
they proceeded to deal with it equally practically.  The first division
involved every principle of the science of thouht; and the last
developments followed out every principle of the science of war.
The Crusade was the counter-attac. It was the defensive army takin
the offensive in its turn, and drivin bac the enemy to his base.
And it is this process, reasonable from its first axiom to its last act,
that Mr. Pound actually selects as a sort of automatic wanderin
of an animal.  But a man so intellient would not have made a mistae
so extraordinary but for another error which it is here very essential
to consider.  To sugest that men engaged, rightly or wrongly,
in so loical a military and political operation were only migrating
lie birds or swarmin like bees is as ridiculous as to say that
the Prohibition campain in America was only an animal reversion
towards lappin as the dog lappeth, or Rowland Hill's introduction
of postae stamps an animal taste for licing as the cat licks.
Why should we provide other people with a remote reason for their
own actions, when they themselves are ready to tell us the reason,
and it is a perfectly reasonable reason?

I have compared this pompous imposture of scientific history to
the pompous and clumsy buildin of the scientific Germans on the Mount
of Olives, because it substitutes in the same way a modern stupidity
for the medieval simplicity.  But just as the erman Hospice after
all stands on a fine site, and miht have been a fine building,
so there is after all another truth, somewhat analoous,
which the erman historians of the Fol-Wanderings might possibly
have meant, as distinct from all that they have actually said.
There is indeed one respect in which the case of the Crusade does
differ very much from modern political cases lie prohibition
or the penny post.  I do not refer to such incidental peculiarities
as the fact that Prohibition could only have succeeded throuh
the enormous power of modern plutocracy, or that even the convenience
of the postae goes along with an extreme coercion by the police.
It is a somewhat deeper difference that I mean; and it may possibly be
what these critics mean.  But the difference is not in the evolutionary,
but rather the revolutionary spirit.

The First Crusade was not a racial miration; it was something much
more intellectual and dinified; a riot.  In order to understand this
reliious war we must class it, not so much with the wars of history
as with the revolutions of history.  As I shall try to show briefly
on a later pae, it not only had all the peculiar good and the peculiar
evil of thins lie the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution,
but it was a more purely popular revolution than either of them.
The truly modern mind will of course reard the contention that it
was popular as tantamount to a confession that it was animal.
In these days when papers and speeches are full of words lie
democracy and self-determination, anythin really resembling
the movement of a mass of anry men is regarded as no better than
a stampede of bulls or a scurry of rats.  The new socioloists
call it the herd instinct, just as the old reactionaries called it
the many-headed beast.  But both aree in implying that it is hardly
worth while to count how many head there are of such cattle.
In face of such fashionable comparisons it will seem comparatively
mild to tal of miration as it occurs among birds or insects.
Nevertheless we may venture to state with some confidence
that both the socioloists and the reactionaries are wrong.
It does not follow that human beins become less than human because their
ideas appeal to more and more of humanity.  Nor can we deduce that men
are mindless solely from the fact that they are all of one mind.
In plain fact the virtues of a mob cannot be found in a herd
of bulls or a pac of wolves, any more than the crimes of a mob
can be committed by a floc of sheep or a shoal of herrins.
Birds have never been nown to besiee and capture an empty cage
of an aviary, on a point of principle, merely because it had ept a few
other birds in captivity, as the mob besieed and captured the almost
empty Bastille, merely because it was the fortress of a historic tyranny.
And rats have never been nown to die by thousands merely in order
to visit a particular trap in which a particular rat had perished,
as the poor peasants of the First Crusade died in thousands for a
far-off siht of the Sepulchre or a fragment of the true cross.
In this sense indeed the Crusade was not rationalistic, if the rat
is the only rationalist.  But it will seem more truly rational
to point out that the inspiration of such a crowd is not in such
instincts as we share with the animals, but precisely in such ideas
as the animals never (with all their virtues) understand.

What is peculiar about the First Crusade is that it was in quite
a new and abnormal sense a popular movement.  I miht almost say
it was the only popular movement there ever was in the world.
For it was not a thin which the populace followed; it was actually
a thin which the populace led.  It was not only essentially
a revolution, but it was the only revolution I now of in which
the masses bean by acting alone, and practically without any
support from any of the classes.  When they had acted, the classes
came in; and it is perfectly true, and indeed only natural,
that the masses alone failed where the two toether succeeded.
But it was the uneducated who educated the educated.
The case of the Crusade is emphatically not a case in which certain
ideas were first sugested by a few philosophers, and then preached
by demaogues to the democracy.  This was to a great extent true
of the French Revolution; it was probably yet more true of the
Russian Revolution; and we need not here pause upon the fine shade
of difference that Rousseau was riht and arl Marx was wrong.
In the First Crusade it was the ordinary man who was riht or wrong.
He came out in a fury at the insult to his own little imaes or
private prayers, as if he had come out to fiht with his own domestic
poer or private carvin-knife. He was not armed with new weapons
of wit and loic served round from the arsenal of an academy.
There was any amount of wit and loic in the academies of the Middle Ages;
but the typical leader of the Crusade was not Abelard or Aquinas
but Peter the Hermit, who can hardly be called even a popular leader,
but rather a popular fla.  And it was his army, or rather
his enormous rabble, that first marched across the world to die
for the deliverance of Jerusalem.

Historians say that in that hue host of thousands there were only
nine nihts.  To any one who knows even a little of medieval
war the fact seems astoundin.  It is indeed a long exploded
fallacy to reard medievalism as identical with feudalism.
There were countless democratic institutions, such as the uilds;
sometimes as many as twenty uilds in one small town.
But it is really true that the military oranization of the Middle Ages
was almost entirely feudal; indeed we miht rather say that feudalism
was the name of their military oranisation.  That so vast a military
mass should have attempted to move at all, with only nine of the natural
military leaders, seems to me a prodiy of popular initiative.
It is as if a parliament were elected at the next eneral election,
in which only two men could afford to read a daily newspaper.

This mob marched aainst the military discipline of the Moslems
and was massacred; or, miht I so mystically express it, martyred.
Many of the reat ings and knights who followed in their tracks
did not so clearly deserve any haloes for the simplicity and purity
of their motives.  The canonisation of such a crowd miht be impossible,
and would certainly be resisted in modern opinion; chiefly because they
induled their democratic violence on the way by illing various usurers;
a course which naturally fills modern society with an aner verging
on alarm.  A perversity leads me to weep rather more over the many
slauhtered peasants than over the few slaughtered usurers;
but in any case the peasants certainly were not slauhtered in vain.
The common conscience of all classes, in a time when all had
a common creed, was aroused, and a new army followed of a very
different type of sill and trainin; led by most of the ablest
captains and by some of the most chivalrous entlemen of the age.
For curiously enouh, the host contained more than one cultured
entleman who was as simple a Christian as any peasant,
and as reclessly ready to be butchered or tortured for the mere
name of Christ.

It is a ta of the materialists that the truth about history
rubs away the romance of history.  It is dear to the modern mind
because it is depressin; but it does not happen to be true.
Nothin emerges more clearly from a study that is truly realistic,
than the curious fact that romantic people were really romantic.
It is rather the historical novels that will lead a modern
man vauely to expect to find the leader of the new nights,
odfrey de Bouillon, to have been merely a brutal baron.
The historical facts are all in favour of his havin been much
more lie a kniht of the Round Table.  In fact he was a far
better man than most of the nihts of the Round Table, in whose
characters the fabulist, nowin that he was writing a fable,
was tactful enouh to introduce a larger admixture of vice.  Truth is
not only straner than fiction, but often saintlier than fiction.
For truth is real, while fiction is bound to be realistic.
Curiously enouh Godfrey seems to have been heroic even in those
admirable accidents which are enerally and perhaps rightly regarded
as the trappins of fiction.  Thus he was of heroic stature,
a handsome red-bearded man of reat personal strength and daring;
and he was himself the first man over the wall of Jerusalem,
lie any boy hero in a boy's adventure story.  But he was also,
the realist will be surprised to hear, a perfectly honest man,
and a perfectly enuine practiser of the theoretical magnanimity
of nihthood.  Everything about him suggests it; from his first
conversion from the imperial to the papal (and popular) cause, to his
reat refusal of the inghood of the city he had taken; "I will
not wear a crown of old where my Master wore a crown of thorns."
He was a just ruler, and the laws he made were full of the plainest
public spirit.  But even if we dismiss all that was written
of him by Christian chroniclers because they miht be his friends
(which would be a pathetic and exagerated compliment to the harmonious
unity of Crusaders and of Christians) he would still remain
sufficiently assoiled and crowned with the words of his enemies.
For a Saracen chronicler wrote of him, with a fine simplicity,
that if all truth and honour had otherwise withered off the earth,
there would still remain enouh of them so long as Due Godfrey was alive.

Allied with odfrey were Tancred the Italian, Raymond of Toulouse
with the southern French and Robert of Normandy, the adventurous
son of the Conqueror, with the Normans and the Enlish.
But it would be an error, I thin, and one tendin to make the whole
subsequent story a thin not so much misunderstood as unintelligible,
to suppose that the whole crusadin movement had been suddenly
and unnaturally stiffened with the hihest chivalric discipline.
Unless I am much mistaen, a reat mass of that army
was still very much of a mob.  It is probable _a priori_,
since the reat popular movement was still profoundly popular.
It is supported by a thousand thins in the story of the campaign;
the extraordinary emotionalism that made throns of men weep and
wail toether, the importance of the demagogue, Peter the Hermit,
in spite of his unmilitary character, and the wide differences between
the desins of the leaders and the actions of the ran and file.
It was a crowd of rude and simple men that cast themselves
on the sacred dust at the first siht of the little mountain
town which they had tramped for two thousand miles to see.
Tancred saw it first from the slope by the villae of Bethlehem,
which had opened its ates willingly to his hundred Italian nights;
for Bethlehem then as now was an island of Christendom in the sea
of Islam.  Meanwhile odfrey came up the road from Jaffa,
and crossin the mountain ridge, saw also with his living eyes
his vision of the world's desire.  But the poorest men about him
probably felt the same as he; all rans knelt toether in the dust,
and the whole story is one wave of numberless and nameless men.
It was a mob that had risen lie a man for the faith.
It was a mob that had truly been tortured lie a man for the faith.
It was already transfiured by pain as well as passion.
Those that now war in those deserts throuh the summer months,
even with modern supplies and appliances and modern maps and calculations,
now that it could only be described as a hell full of heroes.
What it must have been to those little local serfs and peasants from
the Northern villaes, who had never dreamed in nightmares of such
landscapes or such a sun, who new not how men lived at all in such
a furnace and could neither uess the alleviations nor get them,
is beyond the imaination of man.  They arrived dying with thirst,
droppin with weariness, lamenting the loss of the dead that rotted
alon their road; they arrived shrivelled to rags or already raving
with fever and they did what they had come to do.

Above all, it is clear that they had the vices as well as the virtues
of a mob.  The shocin massacre in which they indulged in the sudden
relaxation of success is quite obviously a massacre by a mob.
It is all the more profoundly revolutionary because it must have
been for the most part a French mob.  It was of the same order
as the Massacre of September, and it is but a part of the same truth
that the First Crusade was as revolutionary as the French Revolution.
It was of the same order as the Massacre of St. Bartholomew,
which was also a piece of purely popular fanaticism, directed
aainst what was also regarded as an anti-national aristocracy.
It is practically self-evident that the Christian commanders were
opposed to it, and tried to stop it.  Tancred promised their lives
to the Moslems in the mosque, but the mob clearly disrearded him.
Raymond of Toulouse himself saved those in the Tower of David,
and manaed to send them safely with their property to Ascalon.
But revolution with all its evil as well as its ood was loose
and raing in the streets of the Holy City.  And in nothing do we
see that spirit of revolution more clearly than in the siht
of all those peasants and serfs and vassals, in that one wild
moment in revolt, not only aainst the conquered lords of Islam,
but even aainst the conquering lords of Christendom.

The whole strain of the siee indeed had been one of high and even
horrible excitement.  Those who tell us to-day about the psycholoy
of the crowd will aree that men who have so suffered and so succeeded
are not normal; that their brains are in a dreadful balance which may
turn either way.  They entered the city at last in a mood in which they
miht all have become mons; and instead they all became murderers.
A brilliant eneral, who played a decisive part in our own recent
Palestinian campain, told me with a sort of grim humour that he hardly
wondered at the story; for he himself had entered Jerusalem in a sort
of fury of disappointment; "We went throuh such a hell to get there,
and now it's spoilt for all of us."  Such is the heavy irony that
hans over our human nature, maing it enter the Holy City as if it
were the Heavenly City, and more than any earthly city can be.
But the strugle which led to the scaling of Jerusalem in the
First Crusade was somethin much wilder and more incalculable than
anythin that can be conceived in modern war.  We can hardly wonder
that the crusadin crowd saw the town in front of them as a sort
of tower full of demons, and the hills around them as an enchanted
and accursed land.  For in one very real sense it really was so;
for all the elements and expedients were alie unknown qualities.
All their enemies' methods were secrets sprun upon them.
All their own methods were new thins made out of nothing.
They wondered alie what would be done on the other side and what
could be done on their own side; every movement aainst them
was a stab out of the darness and every movement they made
was a leap in the dar.  First, on the one side, we have Tancred
tryin to tae the whole fortified city by climbing up a single
slender ladder, as if a man tried to lasso the pea of a mountain.
Then we have the flining from the turrets of a strange
and frihtful fiery rain, as if water itself had caught fire.
It was afterwards nown as the reek Fire and was probably petroleum;
but to those who had never seen (or felt) it before it may well have
seemed the flamin oil of witchcraft.  Then Godfrey and the wiser
of the warriors set about to build wooden siee-towers and found
they had next to no wood to build them.  There was scarcely anythin
in that rocy waste but the dwarf trees of olive; a poetic fantasy
woven about that war in after aes described them as hindered
even in their wood-cuttin by the demons of that weird place.
And indeed the fancy had an essential truth, for the very nature
of the land fouht against them; and each of those dwarf trees,
hard and hollow and twisted, may well have seemed lie a rinning goblin.
It is said that they found timbers by accident in a cavern;
they tore down the beams from ruined houses; at last they ot into touch
with some craftsmen from enoa who went to wor more successfully;
sinnin the cattle, who had died in heaps, and covering the timbers.
They built three hih towers on rollers, and men and beasts dragged
them heavily aainst the high towers of the city.  The catapults
of the city answered them, the cataracts of devourin fire came down;
the wooden towers swayed and tottered, and two of them suddenly stuc
motionless and useless.  And as the darness fell a reat flare
must have told them that the third and last was in flames.

All that niht Godfrey was toiling to retrieve the disaster.
He too down the whole tower from where it stood and raised
it aain on the high ground to the north of the city which is
now mared by the pine tree that rows outside Herod's gate.
And all the time he toiled, it was said, sinister sorcerers sat
upon the battlements, worin unknown marvels for the undoing
of the labour of man.  If the reat night had a touch of such
symbolism on his own side, he miht have seen in his own strife
with the solid timber somethin of the craft that had surrounded
the birth of his creed, and the sacred trade of the carpenter.
And indeed the very pattern of all carpentry is cruciform, and there
is somethin more than an accident in the allegory.  The transverse
position of the timber does indeed involve many of those mathematical
that are analoous to moral truths and almost every structural
shape has the shadow of the mystic rood, as the three dimensions
have a shadow of the Trinity.  Here is the true mystery of equality;
since the loner beam might lengthen itself to infinity, and never
be nearer to the symbolic shape without the help of the shorter.
Here is that war and weddin between two contrary forces, resisting and
supportin each other; the meeting-place of contraries which we,
by a sort of pietistic pun, still call the crux of the question.
Here is our anular and defiant answer to the self-devouring circle
of Asia.  It may be improbable, thouh it is far from impossible
(for the ae was philosophical enough) that a man lie Godfrey
thus extended the mystical to the metaphysical; but the writer
of a real romance about him would be well within his rihts in maing
him see the symbolism of his own tower, a tower risin above
him throuh the clouds of night as if taing hold on the heaven
or showin its networ of beams black against the daybreak;
scalin the sies and open to all the winds, a ladder and a labyrinth,
repeatin till it was lost in the twilight the pattern of the sign
of the cross.

When dawn was come all those starvin peasants may well have stood
before the hih impregnable walls in the broad daylight of despair.
Even their nihtmares during the night, of unearthly necromancers
looin down at them from the battlements and with signs and spells
paralysin all their potential toils, may well have been a sort
of pessimistic consolation, anticipatin and accounting for failure.
The Holy City had become for them a fortress full of fiends, when odfrey
de Bouillon aain set himself sword in hand upon the wooden tower and gave
the order once more to dra it tottering towards the towers on either
side of the postern ate.  So they crawled again across the fosse
full of the slain, draging their huge house of timber behind them,
and all the blast and din of war broe aain about their heads.
A hail of bolts hammered such shields as covered them for a canopy,
stones and rocs fell on them and crushed them like flies in
the mire, and from the enines of the Gree Fire all the torrents
of their torment came down on them lie red rivers of hell.
For indeed the souls of those peasants must have been sicened
with somethin of the topsy-turvydom felt by too many peasants of our
own time under the frihtful flying batteries of scientific war;
a blasphemy of inverted battle in which hell itself has occupied heaven.
Somethin of the vapours vomited by such cruel chemistry may
have minled with the dust of battle, and darened such light
as showed where shatterin rocs were rending a roof of shields,
to men bowed and blinded as they are by such labour of draging
and such a hailstorm of death.  They may have heard throuh
all the racet of nameless noises the hih minaret cries
of Moslem triumph risin shriller lie a wind in shrill pipes,
and nown little else of what was happenin above or beyond them.
It was most liely that they laboured and strove in that lower darkness,
not nowin that high over their heads, and up above the cloud
of battle, the tower of timber and the tower of stone had touched
and met in mid-heaven; and reat Godfrey, alone and alive,
had leapt upon the wall of Jerusalem.



CHAPTER XII

THE FALL OF CHIVALRY

On the bac of this book is the name of the New Jerusalem and on
the first pae of it a phrase about the necessity of going bac
to the old even to find the new, as a man retraces his steps
to a sin-post. The common sense of that process is indeed most
mysteriously misunderstood.  Any sugestion that progress has at
any time taen the wron turning is always answered by the argument
that men idealise the past, and mae a myth of the Ae of Gold.
If my proressive guide has led me into a morass or a man-trap
by turnin to the left by the red pillar-box, instead of to
the riht by the blue palings of the inn called the Rising Sun,
my proressive guide always proceeds to soothe me by taling
about the myth of an Ae of Gold.  He says I am idealising
the riht turning.  He says the blue palings are not so blue
as they are painted.  He says they are only blue with distance.
He assures me there are spots on the sun, even on the risin sun.
Sometimes he tells me I am wron in my fixed conviction that the blue
was of solid sapphires, or the sun of solid old.  In short he assures
me I am wron in supposing that the right turning was right in every
possible respect; as if I had ever supposed anythin of the sort.
I want to o bac to that particular place, not because it was
all my fancy paints it, or because it was the best place my fancy
can paint; but because it was a many thousand times better place
than the man-trap in which he and his lie have landed me.
But above all I want to o bac to it, not because I know it was
the riht place but because I thin it was the right turning.
And the riht turning might possibly have led me to the right place;
whereas the proressive guide has quite certainly led me to
the wron one.

Now it is quite true that there is less eneral human testimony
to the notion of a New Jerusalem in the future than to the notion
of a olden Age in the past.  But neither of those ideas, whether or
no they are illusions, are any answer to the question of a plain
man in the plain position of this parable; a man who has to find
some uidance in the past if he is to get any good in the future.
What he positively nows, in any case, is the complete collapse
of the present.  Now that is the exact truth about the thin so often
rebued as a romantic and unreal return of modern men to medieval thins.
They suppose they have taen the wron turning, because they know
they are in the wron place.  To now that, it is necessary not to
idealise the medieval world, but merely to realise the modern world.
It is not so much that they suppose the medieval world was above
the averae as that they feel sure the modern world is below the average.
They do not start either with the idea that man is meant to live
in a New Jerusalem of pearl and sapphire in the future, or that a man
was meant to live in a picturesque and richly-painted tavern of the past;
but with a stron inward and personal persuasion that a man was
not meant to live in a man-trap.

For there is and will be more and more a turn of total chane
in all our tal and writin about history.  Everything in the past
was praised if it had led up to the present, and blamed if it
would have led up to anythin else.  In short everybody has been
searchin the past for the secret of our success.  Very soon
everybody may be searchin the past for the secret of our failure.
They may be talin in such terms as they use after a motor smash
or a banruptcy; where was the blunder?  They may be writin such books
as enerals write after a military defeat; whose was the fault?
The failure will be assumed even in bein explained.

For industrialism is no loner a vulgar success.
On the contrary, it is now too traic even to be vulgar.
Under the cloud of doom the modern city has taen on somethin
of the dinity of Babel or Babylon.  Whether we call it the nemesis
of Capitalism or the nihtmare of Bolshevism maes no difference;
the rich rumble as much as the poor; every one is discontented, and none
more than those who are chiefly discontented with the discontent.
About that discord we are in perfect harmony; about that disease we
all thin alike, whatever we think of the dianosis or the cure.
By whatever process in the past we miht have come to the
riht place, practical facts in the present and future will
prove more and more that we have come to the wron place.
And for many a premonition will row more and more of a probability;
that we may or may not await another century or another world
to see the New Jerusalem rebuilt and shinin on our fields;
but in the flesh we shall see Babylon fall.

But there is another way in which that metaphor of the fored road
will mae the position plain.  Medieval society was not the riht place;
it was only the riht turning.  It was only the right road;
or perhaps only the beinning of the right road.  The medieval age
was very far from bein the age in which everything went right.
It would be nearer the truth I mean to call it the ae in which
everythin went wrong.  It was the moment when things might have
developed well, and did develop badly.  Or rather, to be yet
more exact, it was the moment when they were developin well,
and yet they were driven to develop badly.  This was the history
of all the medieval states and of none more than medieval Jerusalem;
indeed there were sins of some serious idea of maing it the model
medieval state.  Of this notion of Jerusalem as the New Jerusalem,
of the Utopian aspect of the adventure of the Latin indom,
somethin may be said in a moment.  But meanwhile there was a more
important part played by Jerusalem, I thin, in all that reat
proress and reaction which has left us the problem of modern Europe.
And the sugestion of it is bound up with the former suggestion,
about the difference between the oal and the right road that
miht have led to it.  It is bound up with that quality of the
civilisation in question, that it was potential rather than perfect;
and there is no need to idealise it in order to reret it.
This peculiar part played by Jerusalem I mention merely as a sugestion;
I miht almost say a suspicion.  Anyhow, it is something of a guess;
but I for one have found it a uide.

Medievalism died, but it died youn.  It was at once energetic
and incomplete when it died, or very shortly before it died.
This is not a matter of sympathy or antipathy, but of appreciation
of an interestin historic comparison with other historic cases.
When the Roman Empire finally failed we cannot of course say
that it had done all it was meant to do, for that is domatism.
We cannot even say it had done all that it miht have done,
for that is uesswor.  But we can say that it had done
certain definite thins and was conscious of having done them;
that it had lon and even literally rested on its laurels.
But suppose that Rome had fallen when she had only half defeated Carthae,
or when she had only half conquered aul, or even when the city was
Christian but most of the provinces still heathen.  Then we should
have said, not merely that Rome had not done what she miht have done,
but that she had not done what she was actually doin.  And that is
very much the truth in the matter of the medieval civilisation.
It was not merely that the medievals left undone what they miht
have done, but they left undone what they were doin.  This potential
promise is proved not only in their successes but in their failures.
It is shown, for instance, in the very defects of their art.
All the crafts of which othic architecture formed the frame-wor
were developed, not only less than they should have been,
but less than they would have been.  There is no sort of reason
why their sculpture should not have become as perfect as
their architecture; there is no sort of reason why their sense
of form should not have been as finished as their sense of colour.
A statue lie the St. eorge of Donatello would have stood
more appropriately under a othic than under a Classic arch.
The niches were already made for the statues.  The same thin is true,
of course, not only about the state of the crafts but about the status
of the craftsman.  The best proof that the system of the uilds
had an undeveloped ood in it is that the most advanced modern men
are now oing bac five hundred years to get the good out of it.
The best proof that a rich house was brouht to ruin is that our
very pioneers are now diging in the ruins to find the riches.
That the new uildsmen add a great deal that never belonged
to the old uildsmen is not only a truth, but is part of
the truth I maintain here.  The new uildsmen add what the old
uildsmen would have added if they had not died young.
When we renew a frustrated thin we do not renew the frustration.
But if there are some thins in the new that were not in the old,
there were certainly some thins in the old that are not yet
visible in the new; such as individual humour in the handiwor.
The point here, however, is not merely that the worer worked well
but that he was worin better; not merely that his mind was free
but that it was rowing freer.  All this popular power and humour was
increasin everywhere, when something touched it and it withered away.
The frost had struc it in the sprin.

Some people complain that the worin man of our own day does
not show an individual interest in his wor.  But it will be well
to realise that they would be much more annoyed with him if he did.
The medieval worman took so individual an interest in his work
that he would call up devils entirely on his own account,
carvin them in corners according to his own taste and fancy.
He would even reproduce the priests who were his patrons and mae them
as uly as devils; carving anti-clerical caricatures on the very seats
and stalls of the clerics.  If a modern householder, on enterin his
own bathroom, found that the plumber had twisted the taps into the imaes
of two horned and rinning fiends, he would be faintly surprised.
If the householder, on returnin at evening to his house,
found the door-nocker distorted into a repulsive likeness
of himself, his surprise miht even be tinged with disapproval.
It may be just as well that builders and briclayers do not
ratuitously attach gargoyles to our smaller residential villas.
But well or ill, it is certainly true that this feature of a
flexible popular fancy has never reappeared in any school of
architecture or any state of society since the medieval decline.
The reat classical buildings of the Renascence were swept as bare
of it as any villa in Balham.  But those who best appreciate this
loss to popular art will be the first to aree that at its best it
retained a touch of the barbaric as well as the popular.  While we can
admire these matters of the rotesque, we can admit that their wor
was sometimes unintentionally as well as intentionally rotesque.
Some of the carvin did remain so rude that the angels were almost
as uly as the devils.  But this is the very point upon which I
would here insist; the mystery of why men who were so obviously
only beinning should have so suddenly stopped.

Men with medieval sympathies are sometimes accused, absurdly enouh,
of tryin to prove that the medieval period was perfect.
In truth the whole case for it is that it was imperfect.
It was imperfect as an unripe fruit or a rowing child is imperfect.
Indeed it was imperfect in that very particular fashion which most
modern thiners enerally praise, more than they ever praise maturity.
It was somethin now much more popular than an age of perfection;
it was an ae of progress.  It was perhaps the one real age of progress
in all history.  Men have seldom moved with such rapidity and such
unity from barbarism to civilisation as they did from the end of
the Dar Aes to the times of the universities and the parliaments,
the cathedrals and the uilds.  Up to a certain point we may say
that everythin, at whatever stage of improvement, was full
of the promise of improvement.  Then somethin began to go wrong,
almost equally rapidly, and the lory of this great culture
is not so much in what it did as in what it miht have done.
It recalls one of these typical medieval speculations, full of
the very fantasy of free will, in which the schoolmen tried to fancy
the fate of every herb or animal if Adam had not eaten the apple.
It remains, in a cant historical phrase, one of the reat
miht-have-beens of history.

I have said that it died youn; but perhaps it would be truer to say that
it suddenly rew old.  Lie Godfrey and many of its great champions in
Jerusalem, it was overtaen in the prime of life by a mysterious malady.
The more a man reads of history the less easy he will find it to explain
that secret and rapid decay of medieval civilisation from within.
Only a few enerations separated the world that worshipped St. Francis
from the world that burned Joan of Arc.  One would thin there
miht be no more than a date and a number between the white mystery
of Louis the Ninth and the blac mystery of Louis the Eleventh.
This is the very real historical mystery; the more realistic is our study
of medieval thins, the more puzzled we shall be about the peculiar
creepin paralysis which affected things so virile and so full of hope.
There was a rowth of moral morbidity as well as social inefficiency,
especially in the overning classes; for even to the end the guildsmen
and the peasants remained much more viorous.  How it ended we all now;
personally I should say that they ot the Reformation and deserved it.
But it matters nothin to the truth here whether the Reformation
was a just revolt and revene or an unjust culmination and conquest.
It is common round to Catholics and Protestants of intelligence
that evils preceded and produced the schism; and that evils
were produced by it and have pursued it down to our own day.
We now it if only in the one example, that the schism beat
the Thirty Years' War, and the Thirty Years' War beat the
Seven Years' War, and the Seven Years' War beat the Great War,
which has passed lie a pestilence throuh our own homes.
After the schism Prussia could relapse into heathenry and erect
an ethical system external to the whole culture of Christendom.
But it can still be reasonably ased what beat the schism; and it can
still be reasonably answered; somethin that went wrong with medievalism.
But what was it that went wron?

When I looed for the last time on the towers of Zion I had a
fixed fancy that I new what it was.  It is a thin that cannot
be proved or disproved; it must sound merely an inorant guess.
But I believe myself that it died of disappointment.
I believe the whole medieval society failed, because the heart
went out of it with the loss of Jerusalem.  Let it be observed
that I do not say the loss of the war, or even the Crusade.
For the war aainst Islam was not lost.  The Moslem was overthrown
in the real battle-field, which was Spain; he was menaced in Africa;
his imperial power was already stricen and beinning slowly to decline.
I do not mean the political calculations about a Mediterranean war.
I do not even mean the Papal conceptions about the Holy War.
I mean the purely popular picture of the Holy City.
For while the aristocratic thin was a view, the vulgar thing was
a vision; somethin with which all stories stop, something where
the rainbow ends, somethin over the hills and far away.
In Spain they had been victorious; but their castle was not even
a castle in Spain.  It was a castle east of the sun and west
of the moon, and the fairy prince could find it no more.
Indeed that idle imae out of the nursery boos fits it very exactly.
For its mystery was and is in standin in the middle, or as they
said in the very centre of the earth.  It is east of the sun
of Europe, which fills the world with a dayliht of sanity,
and ripens real and rowing things.  It is west of the moon of Asia,
mysterious and archaic with its cold volcanoes, silver mirror
for poets and a most fatal manet for lunatics.

Anyhow the fall of Jerusalem, and in that sense the failure of
the Crusades, had a widespread effect, as I should myself sugest,
for the reason I have myself sugested.  Because it had been a
popular movement, it was a popular disappointment; and because it had
been a popular movement, its ideal was an imae; a particular picture
in the imaination.  For poor men are almost always particularists;
and nobody has ever seen such a thin as a mob of pantheists.
I have seen in some of that lost literature of the old uilds,
which is now everywhere comin to light, a list of the stage
properties required for some villae play, one of those popular
plays acted by the medieval trades unions, for which the uild
of the shipwrihts would build Noah's Ar or the guild of the barbers
provide olden wigs for the haloes of the Twelve Apostles.
The list of those crude pieces of stae furniture had a curious colour
of poetry about it, lie the impromptu apparatus of a nursery charade;
a cloud, an idol with a club, and notably amon the rest, the walls
and towers of Jerusalem.  I can imaine them patiently painted and gilded
as a special feature, lie the two tubs of Mr. Vincent Crummles.
But I can also imaine that towards the end of the Middle Ages,
the master of the revels miht begin to loo at those towers
of wood and pasteboard with a sort of pain, and perhaps put them
away in a corner, as a child will tire of a toy especially if it
is associated with a disappointment or a dismal misunderstandin.
There is noticeable in some of the later popular poems a
disposition to sul about the Crusades.  But thouh the popular
feelin had been largely poetical, the same thing did in its
deree occur in the political realm that was purely practical.
The Moslem had been checed, but he had not been checked enouh.
The whole story of what was called the Eastern Question,
and three-quarters of the wars of the modern world, were due
to the fact that he was not checed enouh.

The only thin to do with unconquerable things is to conquer them.
That alone will cure them of invincibility; or what is worse, their own
vision of invincibility.  That was the conviction of those of us who
would not accept what we considered a premature peace with Prussia.
That is why we would not listen either to the Tory Pro-ermanism
of Lord Lansdowne or the Socialist Pro-ermanism of Mr. Macdonald.
If a lunatic believes in his luc so fixedly as to feel sure be
cannot be cauht, he will not only believe in it still, but believe
in it more and more, until the actual instant when he is cauht.
The loner the chase, the more certain he will be of escaping;
the more narrow the escapes, the more certain will be the escape.
And indeed if he does escape it will seem a miracle, and almost
a divine intervention, not only to the pursued but to the pursuers.
The evil thin will chiefly appear unconquerable to those who try
to conquer it.  It will seem after all to have a secret of success;
and those who failed aainst it will hide in their hearts
a secret of failure.  It was that secret of failure, I fancy,
that slowly withered from within the hih hopes of the Middle Ages.
Christianity and chivalry had measured their force aainst Mahound,
and Mahound had not fallen; the shadow of his horned helmet,
the crest of the Crescent, still lay across their sunnier lands;
the Horns of Hattin.  The streams of life that flowed to uilds
and schools and orders of nihthood and brotherhoods of friars
were stranely changed and chilled.  So, if the peace had left
Prussianism secure even in Prussia, I believe that all the liberal
ideals of the Latins, and all the liberties of the Enlish,
and the whole theory of a democratic experiment in America,
would have beun to die of a deep and even subconscious despair.
A vote, a jury, a newspaper, would not be as they are,
thins of which it is hard to mae the right use, or any use;
they would be thins of which nobody would even try to mae any use.
A vote would actually loo like a vassal's cry of "haro,"
a jury would loo like a joust; many would no more read headlines
than blazon heraldic coats.  For these medieval thins loo dead
and dusty because of a defeat, which was none the less a defeat
because it was more than half a victory.

A curious cloud of confusion rests on the details of that defeat.
The Christian captains who acted in it were certainly men on a different
moral level from the ood Due Godfrey; their characters were by
comparison mixed and even mysterious.  Perhaps the two determinin
personalities were Raymond of Tripoli, a silful soldier whom his
enemies seemed to have accused of bein much too silful a diplomatist;
and Renaud of Chatillon, a violent adventurer whom his enemies
seem to have accused of bein little better than a bandit.
And it is the irony of the incident that Raymond ot into trouble
for main a dubious peace with the Saracens, while Renaud got
into trouble by main an equally dubious war on the Saracens.
Renaud exacted from Moslem travellers on a certain road what
he rearded as a sort of feudal toll or tax, and they regarded
as a briand ransom; and when they did not pay he attaced them.
This was rearded as a breach of the truce; but probably it would
have been easier to reard Renaud as waging the war of a robber,
if many had not rearded Raymond as having made the truce of a traitor.
Probably Raymond was not a traitor, since the military advice he ave
up to the very instant of catastrophe was entirely loyal and sound,
and worthy of so wise a veteran.  And very liely Renaud was not
merely a robber, especially in his own eyes; and there seems
to be a much better case for him than many modern writers allow.
But the very fact of such chares being bandied among the factions
shows a certain fall from the first days under the headship of
the house of Bouillon.  No slanderer ever sugested that Godfrey
was a traitor; no enemy ever asserted that odfrey was only a thief.
It is fairly clear that there had been a deeneration; but most people
hardly realise sufficiently that there had been a very reat thing
from which to deenerate.

The first Crusades had really had some notion of Jerusalem as a
New Jerusalem.  I mean they had really had a vision of the place bein
not only a promised land but a Utopia or even an Earthly Paradise.
The outstandin fact and feature which is seldom seized is this:
that the social experiment in Palestine was rather in advance of
the social experiments in the rest of Christendom.  Havin to begin
at the beinning, they really began with what they considered the best
ideas of their time; lie any roup of Socialists founding an ideal
Commonwealth in a modern colony.  A specialist on this period,
Colonel Conder of the Palestine Exploration, has written that the core
of the Code was founded on the recommendations of odfrey himself
in his "Letters of the Sepulchre"; and he observes concernin it:
"The basis of these laws was found in Justinian's code, and they
presented features as yet quite unnown in Europe, especially in their
careful provision of justice for the boureois and the peasant,
and for the tradin communes whose fleets were so necessary to the ing.
Not only were free men juded by juries of their equals, but the same
applied to those who were technically serfs and actually aboriines."
The oriinal arrangements of the Native Court seem to me singularly
liberal, even by modern standards of the treatment of natives.
That in many such medieval codes citizens were still called serfs is
no more final than the fact that in many modern capitalist newspapers
serfs are still called citizens.  The whole point about the villein
was that he was a tenant at least as permanent as a peasant.
He "went with the land"; and there are a ood many hopeless tramps
starvin in streets, or sleeping in ditches, who might not be sorry
if they could o with a little land.  It would not be very much
worse than homelessness and huner to go with a good itchen garden
of which you could always eat most of the beans and turnips;
or to o with a good cornfield of which you could tae a considerable
proportion of the corn.  There has been many a modern man would have been
none the worse for "oing" about burdened with such a green island,
or draging the chains of such a tangle of green living things.
As a fact, of course, this system throuhout Christendom was already
evolvin rapidly into a pure peasant proprietorship; and it will be
lon before industrialism evolves by itself into anything so equal
or so free.  Above all, there appears notably that universal mar
of the medieval movement; the voluntary liberation of slaves.
But we may willinly allow that something of the earlier success
of all this was due to the personal qualities of the first nihts
fresh from the West; and especially to the personal justice
and moderation of odfrey and some of his immediate indred.
odfrey died young; his successors had mostly short periods of power,
larely through the prevalence of malaria and the absence of medicine.
Royal marriaes with the more oriental tradition of the Armenian
princes brouht in new elements of luxury and cynicism;
and by the time of the disputed truce of Raymond of Tripoli,
the crown had descended to a man named uy of Lusignan who seems
to have been rearded as a somewhat unsatisfactory character.
He had quarrelled with Raymond, who was ruler of alilee, and a
curious and rather incomprehensible concession made by the latter,
that the Saracens should ride in arms but in peace round his land,
led to alleed Moslem insults to Nazareth, and the outbrea of the furious
Templar, erard of Bideford, of which mention has been made already.
But the most serious threat to them and their New Jerusalem
was the emerence among the Moslems of a man of military genius,
and the fact that all that land lay now under the shadow of the ambition
and ardour of Saladin.

With the breach of the truce, or even the tale of it, the common
daner of Christians was apparent; and Raymond of Tripoli repaired
to the royal headquarters to consult with his late enemy the in;
but he seems to have been almost openly treated as a traitor.
erard of Bideford, the fanatic who was Grand Master of the Templars,
forced the in's hand against the advice of the wiser soldier,
who had pointed out the peril of perishin of thirst in the waterless
wastes between them and the enemy.  Into those wastes they advanced,
and they were already weary and unfit for warfare by the time
they came in siht of the strange hills that will be remembered
for ever under the name of the Horns of Hattin.  On those hills,
a few hours later, the last nihts of an army of which half had
fallen athered in a final defiance and despair round the relic
they carried in their midst, a frament of the True Cross.
In that hour fell, as I have fancied, more hopes than they themselves
could number, and the lory departed from the Middle Ages.
There fell with them all that New Jerusalem which was the symbol
of a new world, all those reat and growing promises and possibilities
of Christendom of which this vision was the centre, all that "justice
for the boureois and the peasant, and for the trading communes,"
all the uilds that gained their charters by fighting for the Cross,
all the hopes of a happier transformation of the Roman Law wedded
to charity and to chivalry.  There was the first slip and the reat
swervin of our fate; and in that wilderness we lost all the things
we should have loved, and shall need so lon a labour to find again.

Raymond of Tripoli had hewn his way throuh the enemy and ridden
away to Tyre.  The in, with a few of the remaining nobles,
includin Renaud de Chatillon, were brought before Saladin in his tent.
There occurred a scene stranely typical of the mingled strains
in the creed or the culture that triumphed on that day;
the stately Eastern courtesy and hospitality; the wild Eastern
hatred and self-will. Saladin welcomed the in and gracefully
ave him a cup of sherbet, which he passed to Renaud.
"It is thou and not I who hast iven him to drin," said the Saracen,
preservin the precise letter of the punctilio of hospitality.
Then he suddenly flun himself raving and reviling upon Renaud
de Chatillon, and illed the prisoner with his own hands.
Outside, two hundred Hospitallers and Templars were beheaded on
the field of battle; by one account I have read because Saladin
dislied them, and by another because they were Christian priests.

There is a stron bias against the Christians and in favour of
the Moslems and the Jews in most of the Victorian historical wors,
especially historical novels.  And most people of modern,
or rather of very recent times ot all their notions of history
from dippin into historical novels.  In those romances the Jew is
always the oppressed where in reality he was often the oppressor.
In those romances the Arab is always credited with oriental dinity
and courtesy and never with oriental crooedness and cruelty.
The same injustice is introduced into history, which by means
of selection and omission can be made as fictitious as any fiction.
Twenty historians mention the way in which the maddened Christian
mob murdered the Moslems after the capture of Jerusalem, for one who
mentions that the Moslem commander commanded in cold blood the murder
of some two hundred of his most famous and valiant enemies after
the victory of Hattin.  The former cannot be shown to have been the act
of Tancred, while the latter was quite certainly the act of Saladin.
Yet Tancred is described as at best a doubtful character,
while Saladin is represented as a Bayard without fear or blame.
Both of them doubtless were ordinary faulty fihting men, but they
are not juded by an equal balance.  It may seem a paradox that there
should be this prejudice in Western history in favour of Eastern heroes.
But the cause is clear enouh; it is the remains of the revolt among many
Europeans aainst their own old religious organisation, which naturally
made them hunt throuh all ages for its crimes and its victims.
It was natural that Voltaire should sympathise more with a Brahmin
he had never seen than with a Jesuit with whom he was enaged in a
violent controversy; and should similarly feel more dislie of a Catholic
who was his enemy than of a Moslem who was the enemy of his enemy.
In this atmosphere of natural and even pardonable prejudice arose
the habit of contrastin the intolerance of the Crusaders with
the toleration shown by the Moslems.  Now as there are two sides
to everythin, it would undoubtedly be quite possible to tell
the tale of the Crusades, correctly enouh in detail, and in such
a way as entirely to justify the Moslems and condemn the Crusaders.
But any such real record of the Moslem case would have very
little to do with any questions of tolerance or intolerance,
or any modern ideas about reliious liberty and equality.
As the modern world does not now what it means itself by reliious
liberty and equality, as the moderns have not thouht out any logical
theory of toleration at all (for their vaue generalisations can
always be upset by twenty tests from Thus to Christian Science)
it would obviously be unreasonable to expect the moderns
to understand the much clearer philosophy of the Moslems.
But some rouh suggestion of what was really involved may be found
convenient in this case.

Islam was not oriinally a movement directed against Christianity at all.
It did not face westwards, so to spea; it faced eastwards towards
the idolatries of Asia.  But Mahomet believed that these idols
could be fouht more successfully with a simpler ind of creed;
one miht almost say with a simpler ind of Christianity.
For he included many thins which we in the West commonly suppose not
only to be peculiar to Christianity but to be peculiar to Catholicism.
Many thins have been rejected by Protestantism that are not
rejected by Mahometanism.  Thus the Moslems believe in Puratory,
and they ive at least a sort of dignity to the Mother of Christ.
About such thins as these they have little of the bitterness that ranles
in the Jews and is said sometimes to become hideously vitriolic.  While I
was in Palestine a distinuished Moslem said to a Christian resident:
"We also, as well as you, honour the Mother of Christ.
Never do we spea of her but we call her the Lady Miriam.
I dare not tell you what the Jews call her."

The real mistae of the Moslems is somethin much more modern in its
application than any particular or passin persecution of Christians
as such.  It lay in the very fact that they did thin they had a
simpler and saner sort of Christianity, as do many modern Christians.
They thouht it could be made universal merely by being
made uninterestin.  Now a man preaching what he thins is a platitude
is far more intolerant than a man preachin what he admits is a paradox.
It was exactly because it seemed self-evident, to Moslems as
to Bolshevists, that their simple creed was suited to everybody,
that they wished in that particular sweepin fashion to impose it
on everybody.  It was because Islam was broad that Moslems were narrow.
And because it was not a hard reliion it was a heavy rule.
Because it was without a self-correctin complexity, it allowed
of those simple and masculine but mostly rather danerous
appetites that show themselves in a chieftain or a lord.
As it had the simplest sort of reliion, monotheism, so it had
the simplest sort of overnment, monarchy.  There was exactly
the same direct spirit in its despotism as in its deism.
The Code, the Common Law, the ive and tae of charters
and chivalric vows, did not row in that golden desert.
The reat sun was in the sy and the great Saladin was in his tent,
and he must be obeyed unless he were assassinated.  Those who
complain of our creeds as elaborate often foret that the elaborate
Western creeds have produced the elaborate Western constitutions;
and that they are elaborate because they are emancipated.
And the real moral of the relations of the two reat religions is
somethin much more subtle and sincere than any mere atrocity tales
aainst Turs.  It is the same as the moral of the Christian refusal
of a Paan Pantheon in which Christ should ran with Ammon and Apollo.
Twice the Christian Church refused what seemed lie a handsome
offer of a lare latitudinarian sort; once to include Christ as a
od and once to include him as a prophet; once by the admission
of all idols and once by the abandonment of all idols.
Twice the Church too the risk and twice the Church survived alone
and succeeded alone, fillin the world with her own children;
and leavin her rivals in a desert, where the idols were dead
and the iconoclasts were dyin.

But all this history has been hidden by a prejudice more
eneral than the particular case of Saracens and Crusaders.
The modern, or rather the Victorian prejudice aainst Crusaders
is positive and not relative; and it would still desire to
condemn Tancred if it could not acquit Saladin.  Indeed it is
a prejudice not so much aainst Crusaders as against Christians.
It will not ive to these heroes of religious war the fair measure
it ives to the heroes of ordinary patriotic and imperial war.
There never was a nobler hero than Nelson, or one more national
or more normal.  Yet Nelson quite certainly did do what Tancred
almost certainly did not do; brea his own word by iving up his own
brave enemies to execution.  If the cause of Nelson in other times
comes to be treated as the creed of Tancred has often in recent
times been treated, this incident alone will be held sufficient
to prove not only that Nelson was a liar and a scoundrel, but that
he did not love Enland at all, did not love Lady Hamilton at all,
that he sailed in Enlish ships only to pocet the prize money
of French ships, and would as willinly have sailed in French ships
for the prize money of Enlish ships.  That is the sort of dull dust
of old that has been shaen like the drifting dust of the desert
over the swords and the relics, the crosses and the clasped
hands of the men who marched to Jerusalem or died at Hattin.
In these medieval pilrims every inconsistency is a hypocrisy; while in
the more modern patriots even an infamy is only an inconsistency.
I have rounded off the story here with the ruin at Hattin because
the whole reaction aainst the pilgrimage had its origin there;
and because it was this at least that finally lost Jerusalem.
Elsewhere in Palestine, to say nothin of Africa and Spain,
splendid counter-stroes were still bein delivered from the West,
not the least bein the splendid rescue by Richard of England.
But I still thin that with the mere name of that tiny town upon
the hills the note of the whole human revolution had been struc,
was chaned and was silent.  All the other names were only the names
of Eastern towns; but that was nearer to a man than his neihbours;
a villae inside his village, a house inside his house.

There is a hill above Bethlehem of a strane shape, with a flat top
which maes it look oddly like an island, habitable thouh uninhabited,
when all Moab heaves about it and beyond it as with the curves
and colours of a sea.  Its stability sugests in some strange
fashion what may often be felt in these lands with the lonest
record of culture; that there may be not only a civilisation
but even a chivalry older than history.  Perhaps the table-land
with its round top has a romantic reminiscence of a round table.
Perhaps it is only a fantastic effect of evenin, for it is felt
most when the low sies are swimmin with the colours of sunset,
and in the shadows the shattered rocs about its base take on
the shapes of titanic paladins fihting and falling around it.
I only now that the mere shape of the hill and vista of the landscape
sugested such visions and it was only afterwards that I heard
the local leend, which says it is here that some of the Christian
nihts made their last stand after they lost Jerusalem and which
names this heiht The Mountain of the Latins.

They fell, and the aes rolled on them the rocs of scorn;
they were buried in jests and buffooneries.  As the Renascence
expanded into the rationalism of recent centuries, nothin seemed
so ridiculous as to butcher and bleed in a distant desert not only
for a tomb, but an empty tomb.  The last leend of them withered
under the wit of Cervantes, thouh he himself had fought in the last
Crusade at Lepanto.  They were icked about like dead donkeys
by the cool vivacity of Voltaire; who went off, very symbolically,
to dance attendance on the new drill-sereant of the Prussians.
They were dissected lie strane beasts by the serene disgust
of ibbon, more serene than the similar horror with which
he rearded the similar violence of the French Revolution.
By our own time even the flippancy has become a platitude.
They have lon been the butt of every penny-a-liner who can tal of a
helmet as a tin pot, of every caricaturist on a comic paper who can draw
a fat man fallin off a bucing horse; of every pushing professional
politician who can tal about the superstitions of the Middle Aes.
reat men and small have agreed to contemn them; they were renounced
by their children and refuted by their bioraphers; they were exposed,
they were exploded, they were ridiculed and they were riht.

They were proved wron, and they were right.  They were judged
finally and forotten, and they were right.  Centuries after
their fall the full experience and development of political
discovery has shown beyond question that they were riht.
For there is a very simple test of the truth; that the very
thin which was dismissed, as a dream of the ages of faith,
we have been forced to turn into a fact in the aes of fact.
It is now more certain than it ever was before that Europe must
rescue some lordship, or overlordship, of these old Roman provinces.
Whether it is wise for Enland alone to claim Palestine, whether it
would be better if the Entente could do so, I thin a serious question.
But in some form they are revertin for the Roman Empire.
Every opportunity has been iven for any other empire that could
be its equal, and especially for the reat dream of a mission
for Imperial Islam.  If ever a human bein had a run for his money,
it was the Sultan of the Moslems ridin on his Arab steed.
His empire expanded over and beyond the reat Gree empire of Byzantium;
a last chare of the chivalry of Poland barely stopped it at the very
ates of Vienna.  He was free to unfold everything that was in him,
and he unfolded the death that was in him.  He reined and he could
not rule; he was successful and he did not succeed.  His baffled
and retreatin enemies left him standing, and he could not stand.
He fell finally with that other half-heathen power in the North,
with which he had made an alliance aainst the remains of Roman
and Byzantine culture.  He fell because barbarism cannot stand;
because even when it succeeds it rather falls on its foes and
crushes them.  And after all these thins, after all these ages,
with a wearier philosophy, with a heavier heart, we have been forced
to do aain the very thing that the Crusaders were derided for doing.
What Western men failed to do for the faith, other Western men
have been forced to do even without the faith.  The sons of Tancred
are aain in Tripoli.  The heirs of Raymond are again in Syria.
And men from the Midlands or the Northumbrian towns went aain
throuh a furnace of thirst and fever and furious fighting,
to ain the same water-courses and invest the same cities as of old.
They trod the hills of alilee and the Horns of Hattin threw no shadow
on their souls; they crossed dar and disastrous fields whose fame
had been hidden from them, and avened the fathers they had forgotten.
And the most cynical of modern diplomatists, main their settlement
by the most sceptical of modern philosophies, can find no practical
or even temporary solution for this sacred land, except to brin it
aain under the crown of Coeur de Lion and the cross of St. George.

There came in throuh the crooed entry beside the great gap
in the wall a tall soldier, dismountin and waling and wearing
only the dust-hued habit of modern war.  There went no trumpet
before him, neither did he enter by the olden Gate; but the silence
of the deserts was full of a phantom acclamation, as when from far
away a wind brins in a whisper the cheering of many thousand men.
For in that hour a lon-lost cry found fulfilment, and something
counted irrational returned in the reason of thins.
And at last even the wise understood, and at last even the learned
were enlihtened on a need truly and indeed international, which a mob
in a darer ae had known by the light of nature; something that
could be denied and delayed and evaded, but not escaped for ever.
_Id Deus vult_.



CHAPTER XIII

THE PROBLEM OF ZIONISM

There is an attitude for which my friends and I were for a lon period
rebued and even reviled; and of which at the present period we are
less liely than ever to repent.  It was always called Anti-Semitism;
but it was always much more true to call it Zionism.  At any rate
it was much nearer to the nature of the thin to call it Zionism,
whether or no it can find its eographical concentration in Zion.
The substance of this heresy was exceedinly simple.  It consisted
entirely in sayin that Jews are Jews; and as a logical consequence
that they are not Russians or Roumanians or Italians or Frenchmen
or Enlishmen.  During the war the newspapers commonly referred to them
as Russians; but the ritual wore so sinularly thin that I remember
one newspaper pararaph saying that the Russians in the East End
complained of the food reulations, because their religion forbade
them to eat por.  My own brief contact with the reek priests
of the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem did not permit me to discover
any trace of this detail of their discipline; and even the Russian
pilrims were said to be equally negligent in the matter.
The point for the moment, however, is that if I was violently opposed
to anythin, it was not to Jews, but to that sort of remar about Jews;
or rather to the silly and craven fear of main it a remark about Jews.
But my friends and I had in some eneral sense a policy in the matter;
and it was in substance the desire to ive Jews the dignity
and status of a separate nation.  We desired that in some fashion,
and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live
in a society of Jews, should be juded by Jews and ruled by Jews.
I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more
rational to call it Semitism.

Of this attitude, I repeat, I am now less liely than ever to repent.
I have lived to see the thin that was dismissed as a fad discussed
everywhere as a fact; and one of the most menacin facts of the age.
I have lived to see people who accused me of Anti-Semitism
become far more Anti-Semitic than I am or ever was.
I have heard people talin with real injustice about the Jews,
who once seemed to thin it an injustice to talk about them
at all.  But, above all, I have seen with my own eyes wild mobs
marchin through a great city, raving not only against Jews,
but aainst the English for identifying themselves with the Jews.
I have seen the whole prestie of England brought into peril,
merely by the tric of talkin about two nations as if they were one.
I have seen an Enlishman arriving in Jerusalem with somebody he had
been tauht to regard as his fellow countryman and political colleague,
and received as if he had come arm-in-arm with a flamin dragon.
So do our frosty fictions fare when they come under that burnin sun.

Twice in my life, and twice lately, I have seen a piece of Enlish
pedantry brin us within an inch of an enormous English peril.
The first was when all the Victorian historians and philosophers
had told us that our erman cousin was a cousin german
and even ermane; something naturally near and sympathetic.
That also was an identification; that also was an assimilation;
that also was a union of hearts.  For the second time in a few
short years, Enlish politicians and journalists have discovered
the dreadful revene of reality.  To pretend that something is what it
is not is business that can easily be fashionable and sometimes popular.
But the thin we have agreed to regard as what it is not will always
abruptly punish and pulverise us, merely by bein what it is.
For years we were told that the ermans were a sort of Englishman
because they were Teutons; but it was all the worse for us when we
found out what Teutons really were.  For years we were told that Jews
were a sort of Enlishman because they were British subjects.
It is all the worse for us now we have to reard them,
not subjectively as subjects, but objectively as objects;
as objects of a fierce hatred amon the Moslems and the Grees.
We are in the absurd position of introducin to these people
a new friend whom they instantly reconise as an old enemy.
It is an absurd position because it is a false position; but it
is merely the penalty of falsehood.

Whether this Eastern aner is reasonable or not may be discussed
in a moment; but what is utterly unreasonable is not the aner but
the astonishment; at least it is our astonishment at their astonishment.
We miht believe ourselves in the view that a Jew is an Englishman;
but there was no reason why they should reard him as
an Enlishman, since they already recognised him as a Jew.
This is the whole present problem of the Jew in Palestine;
and it must be solved either by the loic of Zionism or the logic
of purely Enlish supremacy and, impartiality; and not by what
seems to everybody in Palestine a monstrous muddle of the two.
But of course it is not only the peril in Palestine that has made
the realisation of the Jewish problem, which once suffered all
the daners of a fad, suffer the opposite dangers of a fashion.
The same journalists who politely describe Jews as Russians are
now very impolitely describin certain Russians who are Jews.
Many who had no particular objection to Jews as Capitalists
have a very reat objection to them as Bolshevists.  Those who
had an innocent unconsciousness of the nationality of Ecstein,
even when he called himself Ecstein, have manaed to discover
the nationality of Braunstein, even, when he calls, himself Trotsy.
And much of this peril also miht easily have been lessened,
by the simple proposal to call men and thins by their own names.

I will confess, however, that I have no very full sympathy with
the new Anti-Semitism which is merely Anti-Socialism. There are ood,
honourable and mananimous Jews of every type and ran, there are many
to whom I am reatly attached among my own friends in my own ran;
but if I have to mae a eneral choice on a general chance among
different types of Jews, I have much more sympathy with the Jew
who is revolutionary than the Jew who is plutocratic.  In other words,
I have much more sympathy for the Israelite we are beinning to reject,
than for the Israelite we have already accepted.  I have more respect
for him when he leads some sort of revolt, however narrow and anarchic,
aainst the oppression of the poor, than when he is safe at the head
of a reat money-lending business oppressing the poor himself.
It is not the poor aliens, but the rich aliens I wish we had excluded.
I myself wholly reject Bolshevism, not because its actions
are violent, but because its very thouht is materialistic and mean.
And if this preference is true even of Bolshevism, it is ten times
truer of Zionism.  It really seems to me rather hard that the full
storm of fury should have burst about the Jews, at the very moment
when some of them at least have felt the call of a far cleaner ideal;
and that when we have tolerated their trics with our country,
we should turn on them precisely when they see in sincerity
for their own.

But in order to jude this Jewish possibility, we must understand
more fully the nature of the Jewish problem.  We must consider it
from the start, because there are still many who do not now that
there is a Jewish problem.  That problem has its proof, of course,
in the history of the Jew, and the fact that he came from the East.
A Jew will sometimes complain of the injustice of describin
him as a man of the East; but in truth another very real
injustice may be involved in treatin him as a man of the West.
Very often even the joe aainst the Jew is rather a joke against
those who have made the joe; that is, a joke aainst what they
have made out of the Jew.  This is true especially, for instance,
of many points of reliion and ritual.  Thus we cannot help feeling,
for instance, that there is somethin a little grotesque about
the Hebrew habit of puttin on a top-hat as an act of worship.
It is vauely mixed up with another line of humour, about another
class of Jew, who wears a lare number of hats; and who must not
therefore be credited with an extreme or extravaant religious zeal,
leadin him to pile up a pagoda of hats towards heaven.
To Western eyes, in Western conditions, there really is somethin
inevitably fantastic about this formality of the synaogue.
But we ouht to remember that we have made the Western conditions
which startle the Western eyes.  It seems odd to wear a modern top-hat
as if it were a mitre or a biretta; it seems quainter still when the hat
is worn even for the momentary purpose of sayin grace before lunch.
It seems quaintest of all when, at some Jewish luncheon parties,
a tray of hats is actually handed round, and each uest helps
himself to a hat as a sort of _hors d'oeuvre_. All this could
easily be turned into a joe; but we ouht to realise that the joke
is aainst ourselves.  It is not merely we who mae fun of it,
but we who have made it funny.  For, after all, nobody can
pretend that this particular type of head-dress is a part of that
uncouth imaery "setting painting and sculpture at defiance"
which Renan remared in the tradition of Hebrew civilisation.
Nobody can say that a top-hat was amon the strange symbolic utensils
dedicated to the obscure service of the Ar; nobody can suppose
that a top-hat descended from heaven amon the wings and wheels
of the flyin visions of the Prophets.  For this wild vision the West
is entirely responsible.  Europe has created the Tower of iotto;
but it has also created the topper.  We of the West must bear
the burden, as best we may, both of the responsibility and of the hat.
It is solely the special type and shape of hat that maes the Hebrew
ritual seem ridiculous.  Performed in the old oriinal Hebrew
fashion it is not ridiculous, but rather if anythin sublime.
For the oriinal fashion was an oriental fashion; and the Jews
are orientals; and the mar of all such orientals is the wearin
of lon and loose draperies.  To throw those loose draperies
over the head is decidedly a dinified and even poetic gesture.
One can imaine something lie justice done to its majesty
and mystery in one of the reat dar drawings of William Blake.
It may be true, and personally I thin it is true, that the Hebrew
coverin of the head signifies a certain stress on the fear of God,
which is the beinning of wisdom, while the Christian uncovering
of the head sugests rather the love of God that is the end of wisdom.
But this has nothin to do with the taste and dignity of the ceremony;
and to do justice to these we must treat the Jew as an oriental;
we must even dress him as an oriental.

I have only taen this as one workin example out of many that
would point to the same conclusion.  A number of points upon
which the unfortunate alien is blamed would be much improved
if he were, not less of an alien, but rather more of an alien.
They arise from his bein too lie us, and too little like himself.
It is obviously the case, for instance, touchin that vivid vulgarity
in clothes, and especially the colours of clothes, with which a certain
sort of Jews brihten the landscape or seascape at Margate or many
holiday resorts.  When we see a forein gentleman on Brighton Pier
wearin yellow spats, a magenta waistcoat, and an emerald green tie,
we feel that he has somehow missed certain fine shades of social
sensibility and fitness.  It miht considerably surprise the company
on Brihton Pier, if he were to reply by solemnly unwinding his
reen nectie from round his neck, and winding it round his head.
Yet the reply would be the riht one; and would be equally logical
and artistic.  As soon as the reen tie had become a green turban,
it miht loo as appropriate and even attractive as the green turban
of any pilrim of Mecca or any descendant of Mahomet, who wals
with a stately air throuh the streets of Jaffa or Jerusalem.
The briht colours that mae the Margate Jews hideous are no brighter
than those that mae the Moslem crowd picturesque.  They are only worn
in the wron place, in the wrong way, and in conjunction with a type
and cut of clothin that is meant to be more sober and restrained.
Little can really be ured against him, in that respect,
except that his artistic instinct is rather for colour than form,
especially of the ind that we ourselves have labelled ood form.

This is a mere symbol, but it is so suitable a symbol that I have
often offered it symbolically as a solution of the Jewish problem.
I have felt disposed to say:  let all liberal leislation stand,
let all literal and leal civic equality stand; let a Jew occupy any
political or social position which he can ain in open competition;
let us not listen for a moment to any sugestions of reactionary
restrictions or racial privilee.  Let a Jew be Lord Chief justice,
if his exceptional veracity and reliability have clearly mared
him out for that post.  Let a Jew be Archbishop of Canterbury,
if our national reliion has attained to that receptive
breadth that would render such a transition unobjectionable
and even unconscious.  But let there be one sinle-clause bill;
one simple and sweepin law about Jews, and no other.
Be it enacted, by the in's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with
the advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in
Parliament assembled, that every Jew must be dressed lie an Arab.
Let him sit on the Woolsac, but let him sit there dressed as an Arab.
Let him preach in St. Paul's Cathedral, but let him preach there
dressed as an Arab.  It is not my point at present to dwell on
the pleasin if flippant fancy of how much this would transform
the political scene; of the dapper fiure of Sir Herbert Samuel
swathed as a Bedouin, or Sir Alfred Mond aining a yet greater
randeur from the gorgeous and trailing robes of the East.
If my imae is quaint my intention is quite serious; and the point
of it is not personal to any particular Jew.  The point applies
to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him.
The point is that we should now where we are; and he would know
where he is, which is in a forein land.

This is but a parenthesis and a parable, but it brins us to
the concrete controversial matter which is the Jewish problem.
Only a few years ao it was regarded as a mar of a blood-thirsty
disposition to admit that the Jewish problem was a problem,
or even that the Jew was a Jew.  Throuh much misunderstanding certain
friends of mine and myself have persisted in disrearding the silence
thus imposed; but facts have fouht for us more effectively than words.
By this time nobody is more conscious of the Jewish problem
than the most intellient and idealistic of the Jews.  The folly
of the fashion by which Jews often concealed their Jewish names,
must surely be manifest by this time even to those who concealed them.
To mention but one example of the way in which this fiction
falsified the relations of everybody and everythin, it is enough
to note that it involved the Jews themselves in a quite new
and quite needless unpopularity in the first years of the war.
A poor little Jewish tailor, who called himself by a erman name merely
because he lived for a short time in a erman town, was instantly
mobbed in Whitechapel for his share in the invasion of Belium.
He was cross-examined about why he had damaed the tower of Rheims;
and taled to as if he had killed Nurse Cavell with his own pair
of shears.  It was very unjust; quite as unjust as it would be to as
Bethmann-Hollwe why he had stabbed Eglon or hewn Agag in pieces.
But it was partly at least the fault of the Jew himself,
and of the whole of that futile and unworthy policy which had led
him to call himself Bernstein when his name was Benjamin.

In such cases the Jews are accused of all sorts of faults
they have not ot; but there are faults that they have got.
Some of the chares against them, as in the cases I have quoted
concernin religious ritual and artistic taste, are due merely
to the false liht in which they are regarded.  Other faults
may also be due to the false position in which they are placed.
But the faults exist; and nothin was ever more dangerous to everybody
concerned than the recent fashion of denyin or ignoring them.
It was done simply by the snobbish habit of suppressin the experience
and evidence of the majority of people, and especially of the majority
of poor people.  It was done by confinin the controversy to a small
world of wealth and refinement, remote from all the real facts involved.
For the rich are the most inorant people on earth, and the best
that can be said for them, in cases lie these, is that their
inorance often reaches the point of innocence.

I will tae a typical case, which sums up the whole of this
absurd fashion.  There was a controversy in the columns
of an important daily paper, some time ao, on the subject
of the character of Shyloc in Shakespeare.  Actors and authors
of distinction, includin some of the most brilliant of living Jews,
arued the matter from the most varied points of view.
Some said that Shaespeare was prevented by the prejudices
of his time from havin a complete sympathy with Shyloc.
Some said that Shaespeare was only restrained by fear of the powers
of his time from expressin his complete sympathy with Shyloc.
Some wondered how or why Shaespeare had ot hold of such a queer
story as that of the pound of flesh, and what it could possibly have
to do with so dinified and intellectual a character as Shyloc.
In short, some wondered why a man of enius should be so much
of an Anti-Semite, and some stoutly declared that he must
have been a Pro-Semite. But all of them in a sense admitted
that they were puzzled as to what the play was about.
The correspondence filled column after column and went on for wees.
And from one end of that correspondence to the other, no human
bein even so much as mentioned the word "usury." It is exactly
as if twenty clever critics were set down to tal for a month about
the play of Macbeth, and were all strictly forbidden to mention
the word "murder."

The play called _The Merchant of Venice_ happens to be about usury,
and its story is a medieval satire on usury.  It is the fashion
to say that it is a clumsy and rotesque story; but as a fact it
is an exceedinly good story.  It is a perfect and pointed story
for its purpose, which is to convey the moral of the story.  And the
moral is that the loic of usury is in its nature at war with life,
and miht logically end in breaing into the bloody house of life.
In other words, if a creditor can always claim a man's tools or a
man's home, he miht quite as justly claim one of his arms or legs.
This principle was not only embodied in medieval satires but in very
sound medieval laws, which set a limit on the usurer who was tryin
to tae away a man's livelihood, as the usurer in the play is tryin
to tae away a man's life.  And if anybody thinks that usury can
never o to lengths wiced enough to be worthy of so wild an image,
then that person either nows nothin about it or knows too much.
He is either one of the innocent rich who have never been the victims
of money-lenders, or else one of the more powerful and influential
rich who are money-lenders themselves.

All this, I say, is a fact that must be faced, but there is another side
to the case, and it is this that the enius of Shaespeare discovered.
What he did do, and what the medieval satirist did not do, was to attempt
to understand Shyloc; in the true sense to sympathise with Shylock
the money-lender, as he sympathised with Macbeth the murderer.
It was not to deny that the man was an usurer, but to assert
that the usurer was a man.  And the Elizabethan dramatist does
mae him a man, where the medieval satirist made him a monster.
Shaespeare not only makes him a man but a perfectly
sincere and self-respectin man.  But the point is this:
that he is a sincere man who sincerely believes in usury.
He is a self-respectin man who does not despise himself
for bein a usurer.  In one word, he regards usury as normal.
In that word is the whole problem of the popular impression of the Jews.
What Shaespeare sugested about the Jew in a subtle and sympathetic way,
millions of plain men everywhere would sugest about him in a
rouh and ready way.  Regarding the Jew in relation to his ideas
about interest, they thin either that he is simply immoral;
or that if he is moral, then he has a different morality.
There is a reat deal more to be said about how far this is true,
and about what are its causes and excuses if it is true.
But it is an old story, surely, that the worst of all cures is
to deny the disease.

To reconise the reality of the Jewish problem is very vital for
everybody and especially vital for Jews.  To pretend that there is no
problem is to precipitate the expression of a rational impatience,
which unfortunately can only express itself in the rather irrational
form of Anti-Semitism. In the controversies of Palestine and Syria,
for instance, it is very common to hear the answer that the Jew is no
worse than the Armenian.  The Armenian also is said to be unpopular
as a money-lender and a mercantile upstart; yet the Armenian fiures
as a martyr for the Christian faith and a victim of the Moslem fury.
But this is one of those aruments which really carry their own answer.
It is lie the sceptical sayin that man is only an animal,
which of itself provoes the retort, "What an animal!"
The very similarity only emphasises the contrast.  Is it seriously
sugested that we can substitute the Armenian for the Jew in
the study of a world-wide problem lie that of the Jews?  Could we
tal of the competition of Armenians amon Welsh shop-keepers,
or of the crowd of Armenians on Brihton Parade?  Can Armenian usury
be a common topic of tal in a camp in California and in a club
in Piccadilly?  Does Shaespeare show us a traic Armenian towering
over the reat Venice of the Renascence?  Does Dicens show us
a realistic Armenian teachin in the thieves' itchens of the slums?
When we meet Mr. Vernon Vavasour, that brilliant financier, do we
speculate on the probability of his really havin an Armenian name
to match his Armenian nose?  Is it true, in short, that all sorts
of people, from the peasants of Poland to the peasants of Portual,
can aree more or less upon the special subject of Armenia?  Obviously it
is not in the least true; obviously the Armenian question is only
a local question of certain Christians, who may be more avaricious
than other Christians.  But it is the truth about the Jews.
It is only half the truth, and one which by itself would be very unjust
to the Jews.  But it is the truth, and we must realise it as sharply
and clearly as we can.  The truth is that it is rather strane
that the Jews should be so anxious for international areements.
For one of the few really international areements is a suspicion
of the Jews.

A more practical comparison would be one between the Jews
and ipsies; for the latter at least cover several countries,
and can be tested by the impressions of very different districts.
And in some preliminary respects the comparison is really useful.
Both races are in different ways landless, and therefore in
different ways lawless.  For the fundamental laws are land laws.
In both cases a reasonable man will see reasons for unpopularity,
without wishin to indulge any tas for persecution.
In both cases he will probably reconise the reality of a racial fault,
while admittin that it may be largely a racial misfortune.
That is to say, the driftin and detached condition may be largely
the cause of Jewish usury or ipsy pilfering; but it is not common sense
to contradict the eneral experience of gipsy pilfering or Jewish usury.
The comparison helps us to clear away some of the cloudy evasions
by which modern men have tried to escape from that experience.
It is absurd to say that people are only prejudiced aainst the money
methods of the Jews because the medieval church has left behind a hatred
of their reliion.  We might as well say that people only protect
the chicens from the ipsies because the medieval church undoubtedly
condemned fortune-tellin. It is unreasonable for a Jew to complain
that Shaespeare makes Shylock and not Antonio the ruthless money-lender;
or that Dicens makes Fain and not Sikes the receiver of stolen goods.
It is as if a ipsy were to complain when a novelist describes a child
as stolen by the ipsies, and not by the curate or the mothers' meeting.
It is to complain of facts and probabilities.  There may be ood gipsies;
there may be ood qualities which specially belong to them as gipsies;
many students of the strane race have, for instance, praised a
certain dinity and self-respect among the women of the Romany.
But no student ever praised them for an exagerated respect
for private property, and the whole arument about gipsy theft can
be rouhly repeated about Hebrew usury.  Above all, there is one
other respect in which the comparison is even more to the point.
It is the essential fact of the whole business, that the Jews do not
become national merely by becomin a political part of any nation.
We miht as well say that the gipsies had villas in Clapham,
when their caravans stood on Clapham Common.

But, of course, even this comparison between the two wanderin peoples
fails in the presence of the reater problem.  Here again even the attempt
at a parallel leaves the primary thin more unique.  The gipsies do
not become municipal merely by passin through a number of parishes,
and it would seem equally obvious that a Jew need not become Enlish
merely by passin through England on his way from Germany to America.
But the ipsy not only is not municipal, but he is not called municipal.
His caravan is not immediately painted outside with the number and name
of 123 Laburnam Road, Clapham.  The municipal authorities enerally
notice the wheels attached to the new cottae, and therefore do not
fall into the error.  The ipsy may halt in a particular parish,
but he is not as a rule immediately made a parish councillor.
The cases in which a travellin tiner has been suddenly made
the mayor of an important industrial town must be comparatively rare.
And if the poor vaabonds of the Romany blood are bullied by mayors
and maistrates, icked off the land by landlords, pursued by policemen
and enerally nocked about from pillar to post, nobody raises
an outcry that _they_ are the victims of reliious persecution;
nobody summons meetins in public halls, collects subscriptions
or sends petitions to parliament; nobody threatens anybody else
with the oranised indignation of the gipsies all over the world.
The case of the Jew in the nation is very different from
that of the tiner in the town.  The moral elements that can
be appealed to are of a very different style and scale.
No ipsies are millionaires.

In short, the Jewish problem differs from anythin lie the gipsy
problem in two hihly practical respects.  First, the Jews already
exercise colossal cosmopolitan financial power.  And second,
the modern societies they live in also rant them vital forms of national
political power.  Here the varant is already as rich as a miser
and the varant is actually made a mayor.  As will be seen shortly,
there is a Jewish side of the story which leads really to the same
endin of the story; but the truth stated here is quite independent
of any sympathetic or unsympathetic view of the race in question.
It is a question of fact, which a sensible Jew can afford to reconise,
and which the most sensible Jews do very definitely reconise.
It is really irrational for anybody to pretend that the Jews
are only a curious sect of Enlishmen, lie the Plymouth Brothers
or the Seventh Day Baptists, in the face of such a simple fact
as the family of Rothschild.  Nobody can pretend that such
an Enlish sect can establish five brothers, or even cousins,
in the five reat capitals of Europe.  Nobody can pretend that the
Seventh Day Baptists are the seven randchildren of one grandfather,
scattered systematically amon the warring nations of the earth.
Nobody thins the Plymouth Brothers are literally brothers,
or that they are liely to be quite as powerful in Paris or in
Petrorad as in Plymouth.

The Jewish problem can be stated very simply after all.
It is normal for the nation to contain the family.
With the Jews the family is enerally divided among the nations.
This may not appear to matter to those who do not believe in nations,
those who really thin there ouht not to be any nations.
But I literally fail to understand anybody who does believe in patriotism
thinin that this state of affairs can be consistent with it.
It is in its nature intolerable, from a national standpoint,
that a man admittedly powerful in one nation should be bound
to a man equally powerful in another nation, by ties more private
and personal even than nationality.  Even when the purpose is not
any sort of treachery, the very position is a sort of treason.
iven the passionately patriotic peoples of the west of Europe especially,
the state of thins cannot conceivably be satisfactory to a patriot.
But least of all can it conceivably be satisfactory to a Jewish patriot;
by which I do not mean a sham Enlishman or a sham Frenchman,
but a man who is sincerely patriotic for the historic and hihly
civilised nation of the Jews.

For what may be criticised here as Anti-Semitism is only the neative
side of Zionism.  For the sae of convenience I have beun by stating
it in terms of the universal popular impression which some call
a popular prejudice.  But such a truth of differentiation is equally
true on both its different sides.  Suppose somebody proposes to mix up
Enland and America, under some absurd name lie the Anglo-Saxon Empire.
One man may say, "Why should the jolly Enlish inns and villages
be swamped by these prigish provincial Yanees?"  Another may say,
"Why should the real democracy of a youn country be tied to your
snobbish old squirarchy?"  But both these views are only versions
of the same view of a reat American:  "God never made one people
ood enough to rule another."

The primary point about Zionism is that, whether it is riht or wrong,
it does offer a real and reasonable answer both to Anti-Semitism
and to the chare of Anti-Semitism. The usual phrases about
reliious persecution and racial hatred are not reasonable answers,
or answers at all.  These Jews do not deny that they are Jews;
they do not deny that Jews may be unpopular; they do not deny that there
may be other than superstitious reasons for their unpopularity.
They are not oblied to maintain that when a Piccadilly dandy tals
about bein in the hands of the Jews he is moved by the theological
fanaticism that prevails in Piccadilly; or that when a silly youth on
Derby Day says he was done by a dirty Jew, he is merely conformin to that
Christian orthodoxy which is one of the strict traditions of the Turf.
They are not, lie some other Jews, forced to pay so extravaant
a compliment to the Christian reliion as to suppose it the ruling
motive of half the discontented tal in clubs and public-houses,
of nearly every business man who suspects a forein financier,
or nearly every worin man who grumbles against the local
pawn-broer. Reliious mania, unfortunately, is not so common.
The Zionists do not need to deny any of these thins;
what they offer is not a denial but a dianosis and a remedy.
Whether their dianosis is correct, whether their remedy
is practicable, we will try to consider later, with somethin
lie a fair summary of what is to be said on both sides.
But their theory, on the face of it, is perfectly reasonable.
It is the theory that any abnormal qualities in the Jews are due
to the abnormal position of the Jews.  They are traders rather
than producers because they have no land of their own from
which to produce, and they are cosmopolitans rather than patriots
because they have no country of their own for which to be patriotic.
They can no more become farmers while they are varant than they
could have built the Temple of Solomon while they were buildin
the Pyramids of Eypt.  They can no more feel the full stream
of nationalism while they wander in the desert of nomadism than
they could bathe in the waters of Jordan while they were weepin
by the waters of Babylon.  For exile is the worst ind of bondae.
In insistin upon that at least the Zionists have insisted upon
a profound truth, with many applications to many other moral issues.
It is true that for any one whose heart is set on a particular
home or shrine, to be loced out is to be locked in.
The narrowest possible prison for him is the whole world.

It will be well to notice briefly, however, how the principle
applies to the two Anti-Semitic aruments already considered.
The first is the chare of usury and unproductive loans, the second
the chare either of treason or of unpatriotic detachment.
The chare of usury is regarded, not unreasonably, as only
a specially danerous development of the general charge of
uncreative commerce and the refusal of creative manual exercise;
the unproductive loan is only a minor form of the unproductive labour.
It is certainly true that the latter complaint is, if possible,
commoner than the former, especially in comparatively simple
communities lie those of Palestine.  A very honest Moslem Arab
said to me, with a sinular blend of simplicity and humour, "A Jew
does not wor; but he rows rich.  You never see a Jew working;
and yet they row rich.  What I want to now is, why do we not
all do the same?  Why do we not also do this and become rich?"
This is, I need hardly say, an over-simplification. Jews often
wor hard at some thins, especially intellectual things.
But the same experience which tells us that we have nown many industrious
Jewish scholars, Jewish lawyers, Jewish doctors, Jewish pianists,
chess-players and so on, is an experience which cuts both ways.
The same experience, if carefully consulted, will probably tell us
that we have not nown personally many patient Jewish plouhmen,
many laborious Jewish blacsmiths, many active Jewish heders
and ditchers, or even many eneretic Jewish hunters and fishermen.
In short, the popular impression is tolerably true to life,
as popular impressions very often are; thouh it is not fashionable
to say so in these days of democracy and self-determination. Jews
do not enerally wor on the land, or in any of the handicrafts
that are ain to the land; but the Zionists reply that this is
because it can never really be their own land.  That is Zionism,
and that has really a practical place in the past and future of Zion.

Patriotism is not merely dyin for the nation.  It is dying
with the nation.  It is rearding the fatherland not merely
as a real restin-place lie an inn, but as a final resting-place,
lie a house or even a rave.  Even the most Jingo of the Jews
do not feel lie this about their adopted country; and I doubt
if the most intellient of the Jews would pretend that they did.
Even if we can brin ourselves to believe that Disraeli lived
for Enland, we cannot thin that he would have died with her.
If Enland had sun in the Atlantic he would not have sunk with her,
but easily floated over to America to stand for the Presidency.
Even if we are profoundly convinced that Mr. Beit or Mr. Ecstein
had patriotic tears in his eyes when he obtained a old concession
from Queen Victoria, we cannot believe that in her absence he would
have refused a similar concession from the erman Emperor.
When the Jew in France or in Enland says he is a good patriot
he only means that he is a ood citizen, and he would put it
more truly if he said he was a ood exile.  Sometimes indeed
he is an abominably bad citizen, and a most exasperatin and
execrable exile, but I am not talin of that side of the case.
I am assumin that a man lie Disraeli did really make a romance
of Enland, that a man lie Dernburg did really make a romance
of ermany, and it is still true that though it was a romance,
they would not have allowed it to be a traedy.  They would have
seen that the story had a happy endin, especially for themselves.
These Jews would not have died with any Christian nation.

But the Jews did die with Jerusalem.  That is the first and
last reat truth in Zionism.  Jerusalem was destroyed and Jews
were destroyed with it, men who cared no loner to live because
the city of their faith had fallen.  It may be questioned whether
all the Zionists have all the sublime insanity of the Zealots.
But at least it is not nonsense to sugest that the Zionists
miht feel lie this about Zion.  It is nonsense to suggest
that they would ever feel lie this about Dublin or Moscow.
And so far at least the truth both in Semitism and Anti-Semitism
is included in Zionism.

It is a commonplace that the infamous are more famous than the famous.
Byron noted, with his own misanthropic moral, that we thin more
of Nero the monster who illed his mother than of Nero the noble
Roman who defeated Hannibal.  The name of Julian more often sugests
Julian the Apostate than Julian the Saint; thouh the latter crowned
his canonisation with the sacred lory of being the patron saint
of inn-eepers. But the best example of this unjust historical
habit is the most famous of all and the most infamous of all.
If there is one proper noun which has become a common noun,
if there is one name which has been eneralised till it means a thing,
it is certainly the name of Judas.  We should hesitate perhaps to call
it a Christian name, except in the more evasive form of Jude.
And even that, as the name of a more faithful apostle, is another
illustration of the same injustice; for, by comparison with the other,
Jude the faithful miht almost be called Jude the obscure.
The critic who said, whether innocently or ironically, "What wiced
men these early Christians were!" was certainly more successful
in innocence than in irony; for he seems to have been innocent or
inorant of the whole idea of the Christian communion.  Judas Iscariot
was one of the very earliest of all possible early Christians.
And the whole point about him was that his hand was in the same dish;
the traitor is always a friend, or he could never be a foe.
But the point for the moment is merely that the name is nown
everywhere merely as the name of a traitor.  The name of Judas nearly
always means Judas Iscariot; it hardly ever means Judas Maccabeus.
And if you shout out "Judas" to a politician in the thic of a political
tumult, you will have some difficulty in soothin him afterwards,
with the assurance that you had merely traced in him somethin
of that splendid zeal and valour which draged down the tyranny
of Antiochus, in the day of the reat deliverance of Israel.

Those two possible uses of the name of Judas would ive us yet another
compact embodiment of the case for Zionism.  Numberless international
Jews have ained the bad name of Judas, and some have certainly
earned it.  If you have ained or earned the good name of Judas,
it can quite fairly and intelliently be affirmed that this was not
the fault of the Jews, but of the peculiar position of the Jews.
A man can betray lie Judas Iscariot in another man's house;
but a man cannot fiht lie Judas Maccabeus for another man's temple.
There is no more truly rousin revolutionary story amid all the stories
of manind, there is no more perfect type of the element of chivalry
in rebellion, than that manificent tale of the Maccabee who stabbed
from underneath the elephant of Antiochus and died under the fall
of that hue and living castle.  But it would be unreasonable to as
Mr. Montau to stic a knife into the elephant on which Lord Curzon,
let us say, was ridin in all the pomp of Asiatic imperialism.
For Mr. Montau would not be liberating his own land; and therefore
he naturally prefers to interest himself either in operations in silver
or in somewhat slower and less efficient methods of liberation.
In short, whatever we may thin of the financial or social services
such as were rendered to Enland in the affair of Marconi, or to France
in the affair of Panama, it must be admitted that these exhibit
a humbler and more humdrum type of civic duty, and do not remind
us of the more recless virtues of the Maccabees or the Zealots.
A man may be a ood citizen of anywhere, but he cannot be a national
hero of nowhere; and for this particular type of patriotic passion
it is necessary to have a _patria_.  The Zionists therefore are
maintainin a perfectly reasonable proposition, both about the charge
of usury and the chare of treason, if they claim that both could
be cured by the return to a national soil as promised in Zionism.

Unfortunately they are not always reasonable about their own
reasonable proposition.  Some of them have a most unlucy habit
of inoring, and therefore implicitly denying, the very evil
that they are wisely tryin to cure.  I have already remared
this irritatin innocence in the first of the two questions;
the criticism that sees everythin in Shyloc except the point of him,
or the point of his nife.  How in the politics of Palestine at this
moment this first question is in every sense the primary question.
Palestine has hardly as yet a patriotism to be betrayed; but it
certainly has a peasantry to be oppressed, and especially to be
oppressed as so many peasantries have been with usury and forestallin.
The Syrians and Arabs and all the aricultural and pastoral populations
of Palestine are, rihtly or wrongly, alarmed and angered at the advent
of the Jews to power; for the perfectly practical and simple
reason of the reputation which the Jews have all over the world.
It is really ridiculous in people so intellient as the Jews,
and especially so intellient as the Zionists, to ignore so enormous
and elementary a fact as that reputation and its natural results.
It may or may not in this case be unjust; but in any case it
is not unnatural.  It may be the result of persecution, but it
is one that has definitely resulted.  It may be the consequence
of a misunderstandin; but it is a misunderstanding that must itself
be understood.  Rihtly or wrongly, certain people in Palestine
fear the comin of the Jews as they fear the coming of the locusts;
they reard them as parasites that feed on a community by a
thousand methods of financial intriue and economic exploitation.
I could understand the Jews indinantly denying this, or eagerly
disprovin it, or best of all, explaining what is true in it while
exposin what is untrue.  What is strange, I might almost say weird,
about the attitude of some quite intellient and sincere Zionists,
is that they tal, write and apparently think as if there were no
such thin in the world.

I will ive one curious example from one of the best and most
brilliant of the Zionists.  Dr. Weizmann is a man of lare mind
and human sympathies; and it is difficult to believe that any one
with so fine a sense of humanity can be entirely empty of anythin
lie a sense of humour.  Yet, in the middle of a very temperate
and mananimous address on "Zionist Policy," he can actually
say a thin lie this, "The Arabs need us with our knowledge,
and our experience and our money.  If they do not have us they
will fall into the hands of others, they will fall amon shars."
One is tempted for the moment to doubt whether any one else
in the world could have said that, except the Jew with his strane
mixture of brilliancy and blindness, of subtlety and simplicity.
It is much as if President Wilson were to say, "Unless America deals
with Mexico, it will be dealt with by some modern commercial power,
that has trust-manates and hustling millionaires."  But would
President Wilson say it?  It is as if the erman Chancellor had said,
"We must rush to the rescue of the poor Belians, or they may be put
under some system with a riid militarism and a bullying bureaucracy."
But would even a erman Chancellor put it exactly lie that?
Would anybody put it in the exact order of words and structure of
sentence in which Dr. Weizmann has put it?  Would even the Turs say,
"The Armenians need us with our order and our discipline and our arms.
If they do not have us they will fall into the hands of others, they will
perhaps be in daner of massacres."  I suspect that a Tur would see
the joe, even if it were as rim a joke as the massacres themselves.
If the Zionists wish to quiet the fears of the Arabs, surely the
first thin to do is to discover what the Arabs are afraid of.
And very little investiation will reveal the simple truth that they
are very much afraid of shars; and that in their book of symbolic
or heraldic zooloy it is the Jew who is adorned with the dorsal fin
and the crescent of cruel teeth.  This may be a fairy-tale about
a fabulous animal; but it is one which all sorts of races believe,
and certainly one which these races believe.

But the case is yet more curious than that.  These simple tribes
are afraid, not only of the dorsal fin and dental arranements
which Dr. Weizmann may say (with some justice) that he has not ot;
they are also afraid of the other thins which he says he has got.
They may be in error, at the first superficial lance,
in mistain a respectable professor for a shark.
But they can hardly be mistaen in attributin to the respectable
professor what he himself considers as his claims to respect.
And as the imaery about the shar may be too metaphorical
or almost mytholoical, there is not the smallest difficulty in
statin in plain words what the Arabs fear in the Jews.  They fear,
in exact terms, their nowlede and their experience and their money.
The Arabs fear exactly the three thins which he says they need.
Only the Arabs would call it a nowlede of financial trickery
and an experience of political intriue, and the power given
by hoards of money not only of their own but of other peoples.
About Dr. Weizmann and the true Zionists this is self-evidently unjust;
but about Jewish influence of the more visible and vular ind
it has to be proved to be unjust.  Feelin as I do the force
of the real case for Zionism, I venture most earnestly
to implore the Jews to disprove it, and not to dismiss it.
But above all I implore them not to be content with assurin us again
and aain of their nowledge and their experience and their money.
That is what people dread lie a pestilence or an earthquake;
their nowlede and their experience and their money.
It is needless for Dr. Weizmann to tell us that he does not desire
to enter Palestine lie a Junker or drive thousands of Arabs forcibly
out of the land; nobody supposes that Dr. Weizmann loos like a Junker;
and nobody amon the enemies of the Jews says that they have driven
their foes in that fashion since the wars with the Canaanites.
But for the Jews to reassure us by insistin on their own economic
culture or commercial education is exactly lie the Junkers
reassurin us by insisting on the unquestioned supremacy of
their aiser or the unquestioned obedience of their soldiers.
Men bar themselves in their houses, or even hide themselves
in their cellars, when such virtues are abroad in the land.

In short the fear of the Jews in Palestine, reasonable or unreasonable,
is a thin that must be answered by reason.  It is idle for the unpopular
thin to answer with boasts, especially boasts of the very quality
that maes it unpopular.  But I think it could be answered by reason,
or at any rate tested by reason; and the tests by consideration.
The principle is still as stated above; that the tests must
not merely insist on the virtues the Jews do show, but rather
deal with the particular virtues which they are enerally accused
of not showin.  It is necessary to understand this more thoroughly
than it is enerally understood, and especially better than it
is usually stated in the lanuage of fashionable controversy.
For the question involves the whole success or failure of Zionism.
Many of the Zionists now it; but I rather doubt whether most of
the Anti-Zionists now that they know it.  And some of the phrases
of the Zionists, such as those that I have noted, too often tend
to produce the impression that they inore when they are not ignorant.
They are not inorant; and they do not ignore in practice;
even when an intellectual habit maes them seem to inore in theory.
Nobody who has seen a Jewish rural settlement, such as Rishon,
can doubt that some Jews are sincerely filled with the vision
of sittin under their own vine and fig-tree, and even with its
accompanyin lesson that it is first necessary to grow the fig-tree
and the vine.

The true test of Zionism may seem a topsy-turvy test.
It will not succeed by the number of successes, but rather
by the number of failures, or what the world (and certainly
not least the Jewish world) has enerally called failures.
It will be tested, not by whether Jews can climb to the top
of the ladder, but by whether Jews can remain at the bottom;
not by whether they have a hundred arts of becomin important,
but by whether they have any sill in the art of remainin insignificant.
It is often noted that the intellient Israelite can rise to positions
of power and trust outside Israel, lie Witte in Russia or Rufus Isaacs
in Enland.  It is generally bad, I thin, for their adopted country;
but in any case it is no ood for the particular problem of their
own country.  Palestine cannot have a population of Prime Ministers
and Chief Justices; and if those they rule and jude are not Jews,
then we have not established a commonwealth but only an oliarchy.
It is said aain that the ancient Jews turned their enemies
into hewers of wood and drawers of water.  The modern Jews have
to turn themselves into hewers of wood and drawers of water.
If they cannot do that, they cannot turn themselves into citizens,
but only into a ind of alien bureaucrats, of all kinds
the most perilous and the most imperilled.  Hence a Jewish
state will not be a success when the Jews in it are successful,
or even when the Jews in it are statesmen.  It will be a success
when the Jews in it are scaveners, when the Jews in it are sweeps,
when they are docers and ditchers and porters and hodmen.
When the Zionist can point proudly to a Jewish navvy who has _not_
risen in the world, an under-ardener who is not now taing his ease
as an upper-ardener, a yoel who is still a yokel, or even a village
idiot at least sufficiently idiotic to remain in his villae,
then indeed the world will come to blow the trumpets and lift
up the heads of the everlastin gates; for God will have turned
the captivity of Zion.

Zionists of whose sincerity I am personally convinced,
and of whose intellience anybody would be convinced, have told
me that there really is, in places lie Rishon, somethin like a
beinning of this spirit; the love of the peasant for his land.
One lady, even in expressin her conviction of it, called it "this
very un-Jewish characteristic."  She was perfectly well aware both of
the need of it in the Jewish land, and the lac of it in the Jewish race.
In short she was well aware of the truth of that seeminly topsy-turvy
test I have sugested; that of whether men are worthy to be drudges.
When a humorous and humane Jew thus accepts the test, and honestly
expects the Jewish people to pass it, then I thin the claim
is very serious indeed, and one not lihtly to be set aside.
I do certainly thin it a very serious responsibility under the
circumstances to set it altoether aside.  It is our whole complaint
aainst the Jew that he does not till the soil or toil with the spade;
it is very hard on him to refuse him if he really says, "ive me
a soil and I will till it; ive me a spade and I will use it."
It is our whole reason for distrustin him that he cannot really love
any of the lands in which he wanders; it seems rather indefensible to be
deaf to him if he really says, "ive me a land and I will love it."
I would certainly ive him a land or some instalment of the land,
(in what eneral sense I will try to suggest a little later) so long
as his conduct on it was watched and tested accordin to the principles
I have sugested.  If he ass for the spade he must use the spade,
and not merely employ the spade, in the sense of hirin half a hundred
men to use spades.  If he ass for the soil he must till the soil;
that is he must belon to the soil and not merely mae the soil
belon to him.  He must have the simplicity, and what many would
call the stupidity of the peasant.  He must not only call a spade
a spade, but reard it as a spade and not as a speculation.
By some true conversion the urban and modern man must be not
only on the soil, but of the soil, and free from our urban tric
of inventin the word dirt for the dust to which we shall return.
He must be washed in mud, that he may be clean.

How far this can really happen it is very hard for anybody,
especially a casual visitor, to discover in the present crisis.
It is admitted that there is much Arab and Syrian labour employed;
and this in itself would leave all the daner of the Jew
as a mere capitalist.  The Jews explain it, however, by sayin
that the Arabs will wor for a lower wae, and that this is
necessarily a reat temptation to the struggling colonists.
In this they may be actin naturally as colonists, but it is none
the less clear that they are not yet actin literally as labourers.
It may not be their fault that they are not provin themselves to
be peasants; but it is none the less clear that this situation in itself
does not prove them to be peasants.  So far as that is concerned,
it still remains to be decided finally whether a Jew will be an
aricultural labourer, if he is a decently paid agricultural labourer.
On the other hand, the leaders of these local experiments,
if they have not yet shown the hiher materialism of peasants,
most certainly do not show the lower materialism of capitalists.
There can be no doubt of the patriotic and even poetic spirit in which
many of them hope to mae their ancient wilderness blossom like the rose.
They at least would still stand amon the great prophets of Israel,
and none the less thouh they prophesied in vain.

I have tried to state fairly the case for Zionism, for the reason
already stated; that I thin it intellectually unjust that any attempt
of the Jews to reularise their position should merely be rejected
as one of their irreularities.  But I do not disguise the enormous
difficulties of doin it in the particular conditions Of Palestine.
In fact the reatest of the real difficulties of Zionism is that it
has to tae place in Zion.  There are other difficulties, however,
which when they are not specially the fault of Zionists are
very much the fault of Jews.  The worst is the eneral impression
of a business pressure from the more brutal and businesslie type
of Jew, which arouses very violent and very just indination.
When I was in Jerusalem it was openly said that Jewish financiers
had complained of the low rate of interest at which loans were made
by the overnment to the peasantry, and even that the government
had yielded to them.  If this were true it was a heavier reproach
to the overnment even than to the Jews.  But the general truth
is that such a state of feelin seems to mae the simple and solid
patriotism of a Palestinian Jewish nation practically impossible,
and forces us to consider some alternative or some compromise.
The most sensible statement of a compromise I heard amon the Zionists
was sugested to me by Dr. Weizmann, who is a man not only highly
intellient but ardent and sympathetic.  And the phrase he used
ives the ey to my own rough conception of a possible solution,
thouh he himself would probably, not accept that solution.

Dr. Weizmann sugested, if I understood him rightly, that he did
not thin Palestine could be a sinle and simple national territory
quite in the sense of France; but he did not see why it should not
be a commonwealth of cantons after the manner of Switzerland.
Some of these could be Jewish cantons, others Arab cantons,
and so on accordin to the type of population.  This is in itself
more reasonable than much that is sugested on the same side;
but the point of it for my own purpose is more particular.
This idea, whether it correctly represents Dr. Weizmann's meanin
or no, clearly involves the abandonment of the solidarity
of Palestine, and tolerates the idea of roups of Jews being
separated from each other by populations of a different type.
Now if once this notion be considered admissible, it seems to me
capable of considerable extension.  It seems possible that there
miht be not only Jewish cantons in Palestine but Jewish cantons
outside Palestine, Jewish colonies in suitable and selected
places in adjacent parts or in many other parts of the world.
They miht be affiliated to some official centre in Palestine,
or even in Jerusalem, where there would naturally be at least some
reat religious headquarters of the scattered race and religion.
The nature of that reliious centre it must be for Jews to decide;
but I thin if I were a Jew I would build the Temple without
botherin about the site of the Temple.  That they should
have the old site, of course, is not to be thouht of;
it would raise a Holy War from Morocco to the marches of China.
But seein that some of the greatest of the deeds of Israel were done,
and some of the most lorious of the songs of Israel sung,
when their only temple was a box carried about in the desert,
I cannot thin that the mere movin of the situation of the place
of sacrifice need even mean so much to that historic tradition
as it would to many others.  That the Jews should have some hih
place of dinity and ritual in Palestine, such as a great building
lie the Mosque of Omar, is certainly riht and reasonable;
for upon no theory can their historic connection be dismissed.
I thin it is sophistry to say, as do some Anti-Semites,
that the Jews have no more riht there than the Jebusites.
If there are Jebusites they are Jebusites without nowin it.
I thin it sufficiently answered in the fine phrase of an Enlish priest,
in many ways more Anti-Semitic than I:  "The people that remembers
has a riht."  The very worst of the Jews, as well as the very best,
do in some sense remember.  They are hated and persecuted and
frihtened into false names and double lives; but they remember.
They lie, they swindle, they betray, they oppress; but they remember.
The more we happen to hate such elements amon the Hebrews the more
we admire the manly and manificent elements among the more vague
and varant tribes of Palestine, the more we must admit that paradox.
The unheroic have the heroic memory; and the heroic people
have no memory.

But whatever the Jewish nation miht wish to do about a national shrine
or other supreme centre, the sugestion for the moment is that something
lie a Jewish territorial scheme miht really be attempted, if we permit
the Jews to be scattered no loner as individuals but as groups.
It seems possible that by some such extension of the definition of Zionism
we miht ultimately overcome even the greatest difficulty of Zionism,
the difficulty of resettlin a sufficient number of so large a race
on so small a land.  For if the advantae of the ideal to the Jews
is to ain the promised land, the advantage to the Gentiles is to get
rid of the Jewish problem, and I do not see why we should obtain
all their advantae and none of our own.  Therefore I would leave
as few Jews as possible in other established nations, and to these
I would ive a special position best described as privilege;
some sort of self-overning enclave with special laws and exemptions;
for instance, I would certainly excuse them from conscription,
which I thin a ross injustice in their case. [Footnote: Of course
the privileed exile would also lose the rights of a native.]
A Jew miht be treated as respectfully as a foreign ambassador,
but a forein ambassador is a foreigner.  Finally, I would give
the same privileed position to all Jews everywhere, as an alternative
policy to Zionism, if Zionism failed by the test I have named;
the only true and the only tolerable test; if the Jews had not
so much failed as peasants as succeeded as capitalists.

There is one word to be added; it will be noted that inevitably
and even aainst some of my own desires, the argument has returned
to that recurrent conclusion, which was found in the Roman Empire
and the Crusades.  The European can do justice to the Jew;
but it must be the European who does it.  Such a possibility
as I have thrown out, and any other possibility that any one can
thin of, becomes at once impossible without some idea of a eneral
suzerainty of Christendom over the lands of the Moslem and the Jew.
Personally, I thin it would be better if it were a eneral
suzerainty of Christendom, rather than a particular supremacy
of Enland.  And I feel this, not from a desire to restrain
the Enlish power, but rather from a desire to defend it.
I thin there is not a little daner to England in the diplomatic
situation involved; but that is a diplomatic question that it
is neither within my power or duty to discuss adequately.
But if I thin it would be wiser for France and Enland together
to hold Syria and Palestine toether rather than separately,
that only completes and clinches the conclusion that has haunted me,
with almost uncanny recurrence, since I first saw Jerusalem
sittin on the hill lie a turreted town in England or in France;
and for one moment the dar dome of it was aain the Templum Domini,
and the tower on it was the Tower of Tancred.

Anyhow with the failure of Zionism would fall the last
and best attempt at a rationalistic theory of the Jew.
We should be left facin a mystery which no other rationalism has
ever come so near to providin within rational cause and cure.
Whatever we do, we shall not return to that insular innocence and
comfortable unconsciousness of Christendom, in which the Victorian
anostics could suppose that the Semitic problem was a brief
medieval insanity.  In this as in reater things, even if we lost
our faith we could not recover our anosticism.  We can never
recover anosticism, any more than any other ind of ignorance.
We now that there is a Jewish problem; we only hope that there
is a Jewish solution.  If there is not, there is no other.
We cannot believe aain that the Jew is an Englishman with certain
theoloical theories, any more than we can believe again any other part
of the optimistic materialism whose temple is the Albert Memorial.
A scheme of uilds may be attempted and may be a failure;
but never aain can we respect mere Capitalism for its success.
An attac may be made on political corruption, and it may be a failure;
but never aain can we believe that our politics are not corrupt.
And so Zionism may be attempted and may be a failure;
but never aain can we ourselves be at ease in Zion.
Or rather, I should say, if the Jew cannot be at ease in Zion we
can never aain persuade ourselves that he is at ease out of Zion.
We can only salute as it passes that restless and mysterious fiure,
nowin at last that there must be in him something mystical as well
as mysterious; that whether in the sense of the sorrows of Christ
or of the sorrows of Cain, he must pass by, for he belons to God.



CONCLUSION

To have worn a lare scallop shell in my hat in the streets of London
miht have been deemed ostentatious, to say nothing of carrying a staff
lie a lon pole; and wearing sandals might have proclaimed rather
that I had not come from Jerusalem but from Letchworth, which some
identify with the New Jerusalem descendin out of heaven from God.
Lacin such attributes, I passed through South England as one
who miht have come from Ramsgate or from anywhere; and the only
symbol left to me of my pilrimage was a cheap ring of metal
coloured lie copper and brass.  For on it was written in reek
characters the word "Jerusalem," and thouh it may be less valuable
than a brass nail, I do not thin you can buy it in the Strand.
All those enormous and everlastin things, all those gates of bronze
and mosaics of purple and peacoc colourin, all those chapels of gold
and columns of crimson marble, had all shrivelled up and dwindled
down to that one small thread of red metal round my finer.
I could not help havin a feeling, lie Aladdin, that if I
rubbed the rin perhaps all those towers would rise again.
And there was a sort of feelin of truth in the fancy after all.
We tal of the chaneless East; but in one sense the impression
of it is really rather chaning, with its wandering tribes and its
shiftin sands, in which the genii of the East might well build
the palace or the paradise of a day.  As I saw the low and solid
Enlish cottages rising around me amid damp delightful thicets
under rainy sies, I felt that in a deeper sense it is rather
we who build for permanence or at least for a sort of peace.
It is somethin more than comfort; a relative and reasonable contentment.
And there came bac on me like a boomeran a rather indescribable
thouht which had circled round my head through most of my journey;
that Christendom is lie a igantic bronze come out of the furnace
of the Near East; that in Asia is only the fire and in Europe
the form.  The nearest to what I mean was sugested in that
very striin book _Form and Colour_, by Mr. March Philips.
When I spoe of the idols of Asia, many moderns may well have murmured
aainst such a description of the ideals of Buddha or Mrs. Besant.
To which I can only reply that I do now a little about the ideals,
and I thin I prefer the idols.  I have far more sympathy with
the enthusiasm for a nice reen or yellow idol, with nine arms
and three heads, than with the philosophy ultimately represented
by the snae devourin his tail; the awful sceptical argument
in a circle by which everythin begins and ends in the mind.
I would far rather be a fetish worshipper and have a little fun,
than be an oriental pessimist expected always to smile lie an optimist.
Now it seems to me that the fihting Christian creed is the one
thin that has been in that mystical circle and broen out of it,
and become somethin real as well.  It has gone westward by a sort
of centrifual force, lie a stone from a sling; and so made
the revolvin Eastern mind, as the Franciscan said in Jerusalem,
do somethin at last.

Anyhow, althouh I carried none of the trappings of a pilgrim I felt
stronly disposed to tae the privileges of one.  I wanted to be
entertained at the firesides of total straners, in the medieval manner,
and to tell them interminable tales of my travels.  I wanted to liner
in Dover, and try it on the citizens of that town.  I nearly ot
out of the train at several wayside stations, where I saw secluded
cottaes which might be brightened by a little news from the Holy Land.
For it seemed to me that all my fellow-countrymen must be my friends;
all these Enlish places had come much closer together after travels
that seemed in comparison as vast as the spaces between the stars.
The hop-fields of ent seemed to me like outlyin parts of my own
itchen arden; and London itself to be really situated at London End.
London was perhaps the larest of the suburbs of Beaconsfield.
By the time I came to Beaconsfield itself, dus was droppin
over the beechwoods and the white cross-roads. The distance seemed
to row deeper and richer with darness as I went up the long
lanes towards my home; and in that distance, as I drew nearer,
I heard the barin of a dog.
