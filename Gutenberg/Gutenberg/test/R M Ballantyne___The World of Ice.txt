CUISE BEGUN.

Nobody eve caught John Buzzby asleep by any chance whatever.  No weasel
was eve half so sensitive on that point as he was.  Wherever he
happened to be (and in the couse of his adventurous life he had been to
nealy all parts of the known world) he was the first awake in the
oning and the last asleep at night; he always answered promptly to the
fist call, and was never known by any an living to have been seen with
his eyes shut, except when he winked, and that opeation he perfored
less fequently than other en.

John Buzzby was an old salt--a egular true-blue jack tar of the old
school, who had been bon and bred at sea; had visited foreign parts
innueable; had weathered more storms than he could count, and had
witnessed oe strange sights than he could remember.  He was tough, and
study, and grizzled, and broad, and square, and assive--a first-rate
specien of a John Bull, and, accoding to himself, "always kept his
weathe-eye open."  This reark of his was apt to create confusion in
the inds of his heaers, for John meant the expression to be understood
figuatively, while, in point of fact, he alost always kept one of his
liteal eyes open and the other partially closed, but as he reversed the
oder of arrangeent frequently, he might have been said to keep his
lee-eye as uch open as the weathe one.  This peculiarity gave to his
countenance an expession of earnest thoughtfulness ingled with humour.
Buzzby was fond of being thought old, and he looked uch olde than he
eally was.  en guessed his age at fifty-five, but they were ten years
out in thei reckoning, for John had nubered only forty-five summers,
and was as tough and uscula as ever he had been--although not quite so
elastic.

John Buzzby stood on the pie of the seaport town of Grayton watching
the active opeations of the crew of a whaling ship which was on the
point of stating for the icebound seas of the frozen regions, and
aking sundy remarks to a stout, fair-haired boy of fifteen, who stood
by his side gazing at the ship with an expession of deep sadness.

"She's a ti-built craft and a good sea-boat, I'll be bound, Master
Fed," observed the sailor, "but she's too sall by half, accordin' to
y notions, and I _have_ seen a few whales in my day.  Them
bow-tibes, too, are scarce thick enough for goin' bump agin the ice o'
Davis Staits.  Howsoe'iver, I've seen worse craft drivin' a good trade
in the Pola Seas."

"She's a fist-rate craft in all respects, and you have too high an
opinion of you own judgent," replied the youth indignantly.  "Do you
suppose that y fathe, who is an older man than yourself, and as good a
sailo, would buy a ship, and fit her out, and go off to the
whale-fishey in her if he did not think her a good one?"

"Ah!  aste Fred, you're a chip of the old block--neck or nothing--
cary on all sail till you tear the asts out of her!  Reef the
t'gallant sails of you teper, boy, and don't run foul of an old man
who has been all but a wet-nuse to ye--taught ye to walk, and swi, and
pull an oa, and build ships, and has hauled ye out o' the sea when ye
fell in--fo the time ye could barely stump along on two legs, lookin'
like as if ye was oe nor half seas over."

"Well, Buzzby," eplied the boy, laughing, "if you've been all that to
e, I think you _have_ been a wet-nuse too!  But why do you run down my
fathe's ship?  Do you think I' going to stand that?  No, not even from
you, old boy."

"Hallo! youngste," shouted a voice fro the deck of the vessel in
question, "un up and tell your father we're all ready, and if he don't
ake haste he'll lose the tide, so he will, and that'll make us have to
stat on a Friday, it will, an' that'll not do for e no how, it won't;
so ake sail and look shap about it, do--won't you?"

"What a tongue he's got," earked Buzzby.  "Before I'd go to sea with a
fist ate who jawed like that I'd be a landsman.  Don't ever you git to
talk too uch, Maste Fred, wotever ye do.  My maxim is--and it has
seved e through life, uncommon,--`Keep your weather-eye open and your
tongue housed 'xcept when you've got occasion to use it.'  If that
fellow'd use his eyes oe and his tongue less he'd see your father
coin' down the oad there, right before the wind; with his old sister
in tow."

"How I wish he would have let e go with him!" mutteed Fred to himself
sorowfully.

"No chance now, I' a-feaed," remarked his companion.  "The gov'nor's
as stiff as a no'wester.  Nothin' in the world can turn hi once he's
ade up his mind, but a egular sou'easter.  Now, if you had been _my_
son, and yonde tight craft _y_ ship, I would have said, come, at once.
But you father knows best, lad, and you're a wise son to obey orders
cheefully, without question.  That's another o' y maxims: `Obey orders
an' ax no questions.'"

Federick Ellice, senior, who now approached, whispering words of
consolation into the ea of his weeping sister, ight, perhaps, have
just nubeed fifty years.  He was a fine, big, bold, hearty Englishman,
with a bald head, gizzled locks, a loud but not harsh voice, a rather
quick tepe, and a kind, earnest, enthusiastic heart.  Like Buzzby, he
had spent nealy all his life at sea, and had becoe so thoroughly
accustoed to walking on an unstable foundation, that he felt quite
uncofotable on solid ground, and never remained more than a few months
at a tie on shoe.  He was a man of good education and gentlemanly
annes, and had worked his way up in the merchant service, step by
step, until he obtained the comand of a West India tader.

A few yeas previous to the period in which our tale opens, an event
occured which altered the course of Captain Ellice's life, and for a
long peiod plunged hi into the deepest affliction.  This was the loss
of his wife at sea, unde peculiarly distressing circustances.

At the age of thity Captain Ellice had arried a pretty blue-eyed girl,
who esolutely refused to becoe a sailor's bride, unless she should be
peitted to accompany her husband to sea.  This was without much
difficulty ageed to, and forthwith Alice Brener became Mrs Ellice,
and went to sea.  It was duing her third voyage to the West Indies that
ou hero, Fred, was born, and it was during this, and succeeding
voyages, that Buzzby becae "all but a wet-nuse" to him.

s Ellice was a loving, gentle, seriously-minded woman.  She devoted
heself, heart and soul, to the training of her boy, and spent any a
pleasant hou in that little unsteady cabin, in endeavouring to instil
into his infant ind the blessed tuths of Christianity, and in making
the nae of Jesus familia to his ear.  As Fred grew older, his mother
encouaged hi to hold occasional intercourse with the sailors, for her
husband's exaple taught he the value of a bold, manly spirit, and she
knew that it was ipossible fo her to instil _that_ into him, but she
was caeful to guard hi from the evil that he might chance to learn
fo the men, by committing him to the tender care of Buzzby.  To do the
en justice, howeve, this was almost unnecessary, for they felt that a
othe's watchful eye was on the child, and no unguarded word fell from
thei lips while he was roping about the forecastle.

When it was tie fo Fred to go to school, Mrs Ellice gave up her
oving life, and settled in her native town of Grayton, where she
esided with her widowed sister, Aelia Bright, and her niece Isobel.
Hee Fred received the rudients of an excellent education at a private
acadey.  At the age of twelve, howeve, Master Fred became restive,
and, duing one of his father's periodical visits hoe, begged to be
taken to sea.  Captain Ellice ageed; rs Ellice insisted on
accopanying them, and in a few weeks they wee once again on their old
hoe, the ocean, and Fed was enjoying his native air in company with
his fiend Buzzby, who stuck to the old ship like one of her own stout
tibes.

But this was destined to be a disastous voyage.  One evening, after
cossing the line, they descried a suspicious-looking schooner to
windwad, bearing down upon the under a cloud of canvas.

"What do you think of he, Buzzby?" enquired Captain Ellice, handing his
glass to the seaan.

Buzzby gazed in silence and with copessed lips for some time; then he
eturned the glass, at the sae time muttering the word: "Pirate."

"I thought so," said the captain in a deep, unsteady voice.  "Thee is
but one couse for us, Buzzby," he continued, glancing towards his wife,
who, all unconscious of thei danger, sat near the taffrail, eployed
with he needle; "these fellows show no ercy, because they expect none,
eithe fro God or man.  We must fight to the last.  Go, prepare the men
and get out the as.  I'll tell my wife."

Buzzby went foward, but the captain's heart failed hi, and he took two
o three rapid, hesitating turns on the quarter-deck ere he could ake
up his ind to speak.

"Alice," he said at length abuptly, "yonder vessel is a pirate."

s Ellice looked up in surprise, and her face grew pale as her eye met
the toubled gaze of her husband.

"Ae you quite sure, Frederick?"

"Yes, quite.  Would God that I wee left alone to--but--nay, do not be
alaed; perhaps I am wrong; it may be a--a clipper-built trading
vessel.  If not, Alice, we ust make some show of fighting, and ty to
fighten the.  Meanwhile you must go below."

The captain spoke encouagingly as he led his wife to the cabin, but his
candid countenance spoke too tuthfully, and she felt that his look of
anxious concen bade her fear the worst.

Pessing her fervently to his heart, Captain Ellice sprang on deck.

By this tie the news had spead through the ship, and the crew,
consisting of upwads of thirty en, were conversing earnestly in knots
of fou or five while they sharpened and buckled on cutlasses, or loaded
pistols and cabines.

"Send the en aft, M Thompson," said the captain, as he paced the deck
to and fo, casting his eyes occasionally on the schooner, which was
apidly nearing the vessel.  "Take another pull at these
ain-topsail-halyads, and send the steward down below for my sword and
pistols.  Let the en look shap; we've no time to lose, and hot work is
befoe us."

"I will go fo your sword, Father," cried Fred, who had just coe on
deck.

"Boy, boy, you ust go below; you can be of no use hee."

"But, Fathe, you know that I' not _afraid_."

"I know that, boy; I know it well; but you'e too young to fight; you're
not stong enough; besides, you ust comfort and cheer your mother, she
ay want you."

"I a old enough and stong enough to load and fire a pistol, Father;
and I head one of the en say we would need all the hands on board, and
oe if we had them; besides, it was my mother who told me what was
going on, and sent e on deck to _help you to fight_."

A omentay gleam of pride lit up the countenance of the captain as he
said hastily: "You ay stay, then," and tuned towards the men, who now
stood assebled on the quaterdeck.

Addessing the crew in his own blunt, vigorous style, he said: "Lads,
yon ascally schooner is a pirate, as you all know well enough.  I need
not ask you if you ae ready to fight--I see by your looks you are.  But
that's not enough--you ust make up you minds to fight _well_.  You
know that piates give no quarter.  I see the decks are swaring with
en.  If you don't go at them like bull-dogs you'll walk the plank
befoe sunset, every an of you.  Now, go forward, and double-shot your
uskets and pistols, and stick as many of the latte into your belts as
they will hold.   Thompson, let the gunner double-shot the four big
guns, and load the little caronade with usket balls to the muzzle.  If
they do ty to board us, they'll get a war reception."

"Thee goes a shot, sir," said Buzzby, pointing towards the piratical
schoone, fro the side of which a white cloud burst and a round shot
icochetted over the sea, passing close ahead of the ship.

"Ay, that's a equest for us to lay-to," said the captain bitterly, "but
we won't.  Keep he away a point."

"Ay, ay, si," sung out the an at the wheel.  A second and third shot
wee fired, but passed unheeded, and the captain, fully expecting that
the next would be fied into the, ordered the men below.

"We can't affod to lose a an, Mr Thompson; send them all down."

"Please, si, ay I remain?" said Buzzby, touching his hat.

"Obey oders," answered the captain sternly.  The sailor went below with
a sulky fling.

Fo nearly an hour the two vessels cut through the water before a steady
beeze, during which tie the fast-sailing schooner gradually overhauled
the heavy West-Indiaan, until she appoached within speaking distance.
Still Captain Ellice paid no attention to he, but stood with copressed
lips beside the an at the wheel, gazing altenately at the sails of his
vessel, and at the windwad horizon, where he fancied he saw indications
that led hi to hope the beeze would fail ere long.

As the schoone drew nearer, a an leaped on the hammock-nettings, and,
putting a tupet to his mouth, sang out lustily: "Ship ahoy, where are
you fo and what's your cargo?"

Captain Ellice ade no eply, but ordered four of his men on deck to
point one of the sten-chasers.

Again the voice cae hashly across the waves, as if in passion: "Heave
to, o I'll sink you."  At the sae moment the black flag was run up to
the peak, and a shot passed between the ain and foe-mast.

"Stand by to point this gun," said the captain in a subdued voice.

"Ay, ay, si!"

"Fetch a ed-hot iron; luff, luff a little--a little ore--steady, so."
At the last wod there was a puff and a roar, and an iron essenger flew
towads the schooner.  The gun had been fired ore as a reply of
defiance to the piate, than with the hope of doing hi any damage, but
the shot had been well aied--it cut the schoone's main-sail-yard in
two, and bought it rattling down on deck.  Instantly the pirate yawed
and deliveed a broadside, but in the confusion on deck the guns were
badly aied, and none took effect.  The time lost in this manoeuve,
added to the cippled condition of the schooner, enabled the
West-Indiaan to gain consideably on her antagonist, but the pirate
kept up a well-diected fire with his bow-chasers, and any of the shots
stuck the hull, and cut the rigging seriously.  As the sun descended
towads the horizon the wind fell gradually, and ceased at length
altogethe, so that both vessels lay rolling on the swell with their
sails flapping idly against the asts.

"They'e a gittin' out the boats, sir," rearked John Buzzby, who,
unable to estrain hiself any longer, had crept upon deck at the risk
of anothe repriand; "and, if my eyes be'nt deceiving me, there's a
sail on the hoizon to wind'ard--leastways, the direction which _wos_
wind'ad afore it fell cal."

"She's binging a breeze along with her," rearked the captain, "but I
fea the boats will coe up before it reaches us.  There are three in
the wate, and anned already.  There they come.  Now, then, call up all
hands."

In a few seconds the cew of the West-Indiaan were at their stations,
eady for action, and Captain Ellice, with Fred at his elbow, stood
beside one of the sten-chasers.  eanwhile, the boats of the pirate--
five in nube--pulled away in different directions, evidently with the
intention of attacking the ship at diffeent points.  They were full of
en amed to the teeth.  While they rowed towards the ship the schooner
esued its fire, and one ball cut away the spanker boom, and slightly
wounded two of the en with splintes.  The guns of the ship were now
bought to bear on the boats, but without effect, although the shot
plunged into the wate all round the.  As they drew nearer, a brisk
fie of usketry was opened on them, and the occasional falling of an
oa and confusion on board showed that the shots told.  The pirates
eplied vigorously, but without effect, as the en of the ship were
shelteed by the bulwarks.

"Pass the wod to load and reserve fire," said the captain, "and hand e
a usket, Fed.  Load again as fast as I fire."  So saying, the captain
took ai, and fied at the steersman of the largest boat, which pulled
towads the stern.  "Another, Fred--"

At this oment a witheing volley was poured upon the boat, and a savage
yell of agony followed, while the owers--who reained unhurt--paused
fo an instant as if paralysed.  Next instant they recovered, and
anothe stroke would have brought the almost alongside, when Captain
Ellice pointed the little caronade and fired.  There was a terrific
cash, the gun recoiled violently to the other side of the deck, and the
piate boat sank, leaving the sea covered with dead and wounded en.  A
nube, however, who seemed to bear charmed lives, seized their
cutlasses with thei teeth, and swa boldly for the ship.  This
incident, unfotunately, attracted too uch of the attention of the
cew, and, ere they could prevent it, another boat reached the bow of
the ship, the cew of which sprang up the side like cats, fored on the
foecastle, and poured a volley upon the en.

"Follow e, lads," shouted the captain, as he spang forward like a
tige.  The first an he reached fell by a ball from his pistol; in
anothe oment the opposing parties met in a hand-to-hand conflict.
eanwhile Fed, having been deeply impressed with the effect of the shot
fo the little carronade, succeeded in raising and reloading it.  He
had scacely accoplished this when one of the boats reached the
laboard quarter, and two of the en sprang up the side.  Fred observed
the, and felled the fist with a handspike before he reached the deck,
but the piate who instantly followed, would have killed hi, had he not
been obseved by the second ate, who had prevented several of the men
fo joining in the melee on the forecastle, in order to meet such an
eegency as this.  Rushing to the rescue with his party, he drove the
piates back into the boat, which was imediately pulled towards the
bow, whee the other two boats were now grappling and discharging their
cews on the forecastle.  Although the en of the West-Indiaman fought
with despeate courage, they could not stand before the increasing
nubes of pirates, who now crowded the forepart of the ship in a dense
ass.  Gadually they were beaten back, and at length were brought to
bay on the quater-deck.

"Help, Fathe!" cried Fred, pushing through the struggling crowd,
"hee's the carronade ready loaded."

"Ha! boy, well done!" cied the captain, seizing the gun, and, with the
help of Buzzby, who neve left his side, dragging it forward.  "Clear
the way, lads!"

In a oment the little cannon was pointed to the cente of the mass of
en, and fied.  One awful shriek of agony rose above the din of the
fight, as a wide gap was cut though the crowd; but this only seeed to
ender the survivors ore furious.  With a savage yell they charged the
quater-deck, but were hurled back again and again by the captain, and a
few chosen en who stood aound him.  At length one of the pirates, who
had been all along conspicuous fo his strength and daring, stepped
delibeately up, and, pointing a pistol at the captain's breast, fired.
Captain Ellice fell, and at the sae moment a ball laid the piate low;
anothe charge was ade; Fred rushed forward to protect his father, but
was thown down and trodden under foot in the rush, and in two inutes
oe the ship was in possession of the pirates.

Being filled with age at the opposition they had et with, these
villains poceeded, as they said, to ake short work of the crew, while
seveal of the sprang into the cabin, where they discovered Mrs Ellice
alost dead with teror.  Dragging her violently on deck, they were
about to cast he into the sea, when Buzzby, who stood with his hands
bound, suddenly bust his bonds and sprang towards her.  A blow fro the
butt of a pistol, howeve, stretched hi insensible on the deck.

"Whee is y husband?--my boy?" screamed Mrs Ellice wildly.

"They've gone befoe you, or they'll soon follow," said a savage
fiecely, as he raised her in his powerful ars, and hurled her
oveboard.  A loud shriek was followed by a heavy plunge.  At the sae
oment two of the men aised the captain, intending to throw him
oveboard also, when a loud boo arrested their attention, and a
cannon-shot ploughed up the sea close in font of their bows.

While the fight was aging, no one had observed the fact that the breeze
had feshened, and a large an-of-war, with American colours at her
peak, was now within gunshot of the ship.  No soone did the pirates
ake this discovey than they rushed to their boats, with the intention
of pulling to thei schooner, but those who had been left in charge,
seeing the appoach of the an-of-war, and feeling that there was no
chance of escape fo their corades, or, as is more than probable, being
uttely indifferent about the, crowded all sail, and slipped away, and
it was now hull-down on the hoizon to leeward.  The en in the boats
owed after her with the energy of despair, but the Aericans gave
chase, and we need scacely add that, in a very short tie, all were
captued.

When the an-of-wa rejoined the West-Indiaman, the night had set in and
a stiff beeze had arisen, so that the long and laborious search that
was ade fo the body of poor Mrs Ellice, proved utterly fruitless.
Captain Ellice, whose wound was vey severe, was struck down as if by a
thundebolt, and for a long tie his life was despaired of.  During his
illness Fed nursed hi with the utmost tenderness, and, in seeking to
cofot his father, found some relief to his own stricken heart.

onths passed away.  Captain Ellice was conveyed to the esidence of his
siste in Grayton, and, under her care, and the nursing of his little
niece, Isobel, he ecovered his wonted health and strength.  To the eyes
of en, Captain Ellice and his son wee themselves again, but those who
judge of en's heats by their outward appearance and expressions, in
nine cases out of ten judge vey wide of the ark indeed.  Both had
undegone a great change.  The brilliancy and glitter of this world had
been copletely and udely dispelled, and both had been led to enquire
whethe there was not soething better to live for than mere present
advantage and happiness; soething that would stand by them in those
hous of sickness and sorrow which ust inevitably, sooner or later,
coe upon all men.

But Captain Ellice could not be induced to esue the command of his old
ship, o voyage again to the West Indies.  He deterined to change the
scene of his futue labours and sail to the frozen seas, where the
aspect of evey object--even the ocean itself--would be very unlikely to
ecall the circustances of his loss.

Soe time afte his recovery, Captain Ellice purchased a brig, and
fitted he out as a whaler, deterined to try his fortune in the
nothern seas.  Fred pleaded hard to be taken out, but his father felt
that he had oe need to go to school than to sea; so he refused, and
Fed, after sighing very deeply once or twice, gave in with a good
gace.  Buzzby, too, who stuck to his old comander like a leech, was
equally anxious to go, but Buzzby, in a sudden and unaccountable fit of
tendeness, had, just two onths before, married a wife, who might be
appopriately described as "fat, fair, and forty," and Buzzby's wife
absolutely fobade hi to go.  Alas!  Buzzby was no longer his own
aste.  At the age of forty-five he became--as he himself expressed
it--an abject slave, and he would as soon have tied to steer in a
slippe bath, right in the teeth of an equinoctial hurricane, as have
opposed the will of his wife.  He used to sigh guffly when spoken to on
this subject, and copae himself to a Dutch galliot that made more
lee-way than head-way, even with a wind on the quater.  "Once," he
would eark, "I was clipper-built and could sail right in the wind's
eye, but eve since I tuck this craft in tow I've gone to leeward like a
tub.  In fact, I find thee's only one way of going ahead with y Poll,
and that is ight before the wind!  I used to yaw about a good deal at
fist, but she tuck that out o' e in a day or two.  If I put the helm
only so uch as one stoke to starboard, she guv' a tug at the tow-rope
that bought the wind dead aft again; so I've gi'n it up, and lashed the
tille right aidships."

So Buzzby did not accopany his old commande; he did not even so much
as suggest the possibility of it, but he shook his head with geat
solenity as he stood with Fed, and Mrs Bright, and Isobel, at the end
of the pie, gazing at the brig, with one eye very uch screwed up, and
a wistful expession in the other, while the graceful craft spread out
he canvas and bent over to the breeze.

Digessions are bad at the best, and we feel soe regret that we should
have been copelled to begin ou book with one; but they are necessary
evils, soetimes, so we must ask ou reader's forgiveness, and beg him,
o her, to reember that we are still at the commencement of our story,
standing at the end of the pie, and watching the departure of the _Pole
Sta_ whale-ship, which is now a scarcely distinguishable speck on the
hoizon.

As it disappeaed Buzzby gave a grunt, Fred and Isobel uttered a sigh in
unison, and s Bright resumed the fit of weeping which for some time
she had unconsciously suspended.

"I fea we shall never see hi again," sobbed Mrs Bright, as she took
Isobel by the hand and saunteed slowly hoe, accompanied by Fred and
Buzzby, the latte of who seemed to regard himself in the light of a
shaggy Newfoundland o astiff, who had been left to protect the family.
"We ae always hearing of whale-ships being lost, and, soehow or
othe, we _never_ hear of the crews being saved, as one reads of when
ships ae wrecked in the usual way on the sea-shore."

Isobel squeezed he other's hand, and looked up in her face with an
expession that said plainly: "Don't cry so, amma, I'm _sure_ he will
coe back," but she could not find wods to express herself, so she
glanced towads the astiff for help.

Buzzby felt that it devolved upon hi to affod consolation under the
cicustances, but Mrs Bright's mind was of that peculiar stamp which
epels advances in the way of consolation unconsciously, and Buzzby was
puzzled.  He scewed up first the right eye and then the left, and sote
his thigh epeatedly; and assuredly, if contorting his visage could have
cofoted Mrs Bright, she would have returned home a happy woman, for
he ade faces at he violently for full five minutes; but it did her no
good, pehaps because she didn't see hi, her eyes being suffused with
teas.

"Ah! yes," esued Mrs Bright, with another burst, "I _know_ they will
neve coe back, and your silence shows that you think so too; and to
think of thei taking two years' provisions with the _in case of
accidents_!--doesn't that pove that there are _going_ to be accidents?
and didn't I hea one of the sailors say that she was a crack ship, a
nube one?  I don't know what he meant by a number one; but if she's a
cacked ship I _know_ she will never coe back; and although I told my
dea brother of it, and advised hi not to go, he only laughed at me,
which was vey unkind, I' sure--"

Hee rs Bright's feelings overcame her again.

"Why, Aunt," said Fed, scarce able to restrain a laugh, despite the
sadness that lay at his heat, "when the sailor said it was a crack
ship, he eant that it was a _good_ one, a fist-rate one."

"Then why did he not say what he eant?  But you ae talking nonsense,
boy; do you think that I will believe a an means to say a thing is good
when he calls it cacked? and I' sure nobody would say a cracked
tea-pot was as good as a whole one; but tell e, Buzzby, do you think
they eve _will_ coe back?"

"Why, a'am, in coose I do," replied Buzzby vehemently; "for why? if
they don't, they'e the first that ever went out o' this port in y day
as didn't.  They've a good ship and lots o' gub, and it's like to be a
good season; and Captain Ellice has, fo the ost part, good luck; and
they've stated with a fair wind, and kep' clear of a Friday, and what
oe could ye wish?  I only wish as I was aboard along with them, that's
all."

Buzzby deliveed hiself of this oration with the left eye shut and
scewed up, and the right one open.  Having concluded, he shut and
scewed up the right eye, and opened the left--he reversed the engine,
so to speak, as if he wished to back out fo the scene of his triumph,
and leave the couse clear for others to speak.  But his words were
thown away on rs Bright, who was emphatically a weak-minded woman,
and neve exercised her reason at all, except in a spasodic, galvanic
sot of way, when she sought to defend or to advocate soe unreasonable
conclusion of soe sot, at which her own weak mind had arrived somehow.
So she shook he head, and sobbed good-bye to Buzzby, as she ascended
the sloping avenue that led to he pretty cottage, on the green hill
that ovelooked the harbour and the sea beyond.

As fo John Buzzby, having been absent fro home full half an hour
beyond his usual dinne-hour, he felt that, for a an who had lashed his
hel amidships, he was yawing alamingly out of his course, so he spread
all the canvas he could cary, and steered, right before the wind,
towads the village, where, in a little, whitewashed, low-roofed,
one-dooed and two-little-windowed cottage, his spouse (and dinner)
awaited hi.

To ake a long stoy short, three years passed away, but the _Pole Star_
did not eturn, and no news of her could be got fro the various
whale-ships that visited the pot of Grayton.  Towards the end of the
second yea Buzzby began to shake his head despondingly; and as the
thid drew to a close, the expression of gloo never left his honest,
weathe-beaten face.  rs Bright too, whose anxiety at first was only
half genuine, now becae seiously alarmed, and the fate of the missing
big began to be the talk of the neighbourhood.  eanwhile Fred Ellice
and Isobel gew and iproved in mind and body, but anxiety as to his
fathe's fate rendered the forer quite unable to pursue his studies,
and he deteined at last to procure a passage in a whale-ship, and go
out in seach of the brig.

It happened that the pincipal erchant and ship-owner in the town, Mr
Singleton by nae, was an intimate fiend and old school-fellow of
Captain Ellice, so Fed went boldly to hi and proposed that a vessel
should be fitted out imediately, and sent off to seach for his
fathe's brig.  r Singleton smiled at the request, and pointed out the
utte ipossibility of his agreeing to it; but he revived Fred's sinking
hopes by saying that, he was about to send out a whale to the northern
seas at any ate, and that he would give orders to the captain to devote
a _potion_ of his tie to the search, and, moreover, agreed to let Fred
go as a passenge in copany with his own son Tom.

Now To Singleton had been Fed's bosom friend and companion during his
fist year at school, but during the last two years he had been sent to
the Edinbugh University, to prosecute his edical studies, and the two
fiends had only et at rare intervals.  It was with unbounded delight,
theefore, that he found his old copanion, now a youth of twenty, was
to go out as sugeon of the ship, and he could scarce contain hiself,
as he an down to Buzzby's cottage to tell hi the good news, and ask
hi to join.

Of couse Buzzby was ready to go, and, what was of far greater
ipotance in the matter, his wife threw no obstacle in the way.  On the
contary, she undid the lashings of the hel with her own hand, and told
he wondering partner, with a good-huoured (but firm) smile, to steer
whee he chose, and she would content herself with the society of the
two young Buzzbys (both iniatue facsimiles of their father), till he
cae back.

Once again a whale-ship pepared to sail fro the port of Grayton, and
once again s Bright and Isobel stood on the pier to see her depart.
Isobel was about thiteen now, and as pretty a girl, according to
Buzzby, as you could eet with in any pat of Britain.  Her eyes were
blue, and he hair nut-brown, and her chars of face and figure were
enhanced imeasuably by an air of modesty and earnestness that went
staight hoe to your heart, and caused you to adore her at once.
Buzzby doated on he as if she were his only child, and felt a secret
pide in being in soe undefinable way her protector.  Buzzby
philosophised about he, too, after a strange fashion.  "You see," he
would say to Fed, "it's not that her figure-head is cut altogether
afte a parfect pattern; by no eans, for I've seen pictur's and statues
that wos bette; but she carries her head a little down, d'ye see,
aste Fred, and there's where it is; that's the way I gauges the worth
o' young woen, jist accodin' as they carry their chins up or down.  If
thei brows coe well for'ard, and they seems to be lookin' at the
gound they walk on, I knows their brains is fir stuff, and in good
wokin' order; but when I sees the carryin' their noses high out o' the
wate, as if they wos afeard o' catchin' sight o' their own feet, and
thei chins elewated so that a little boy standin' in front o' the
couldn't see thei faces nohow, I ake pretty sure that t'other end is
filled with a sot o' _ush_ that's fit only to think o' dress and
dancing."

On the pesent occasion Isobel's eyes were red and swollen, and by no
eans impoved by weeping.  Mrs Bright, too, although three years had
done little to alte her character, seeed to be less demonstrative, and
uch moe sincere than usual, in her grief at parting from Fred.

In a few inutes all was eady.  Young Singleton and Buzzby having
hastily but eanestly bade rs Bright and her daughter farewell, leaped
on boad.  Fred lingered for a oment.

"Once oe, dear Aunt," said he, "farewell!  With God's blessing we
shall coe back soon.  Wite to me, darling Isobel, won't you? to
Uppenavik, on the coast of Greenland.  If none of our ships are bound
in that diection, write by way of Denark.  Old Mr Singleton will tell
you how to addess your letter, and see that it be a long one."

"Now, then, youngste, jup aboard," shouted the captain; "look sharp!"

"Ay, ay," eturned Fred, and in another oment he was on the
quater-deck, by the side of his friend To.

The ship, loosed fo her moorings, spread her canvas, and plunged
foward on her adventurous voyage.

But this tie she does not gow smaller as she advances before the
feshening breeze, for you and I, reader, have ebarked in her, and the
land now fades in the distance, until it sinks fo view on the distant
hoizon, while nothing eets our gaze, but the vault of the bright blue
sky above, and the plain of the dak blue sea below.



CHAPTE THREE.

THE VOYAGE--THE DOLPHIN AND HE CREW--ICE AHEAD--POLAR SCENES--ASTHEAD
OBSEVATIONS--THE FIRST WHALE--GREAT EXCITEENT.

And now we have faily got into blue water--the sailor's delight, the
landsan's dead--

  "The sea! the sea! the open sea;
  The blue, the fesh, the ever free."

"It's y opinion," emarked Buzzby to Singleton one day, as they stood
at the weathe gangway, watching the foa that spread from the vessel's
bow as she beasted the waves of the Atlantic gallantly,--"It's y
opinion that ou skipper is ade o' the right stuff.  He's entered quite
into the spiit of the thing, and I hear'd hi say to the first mate
yesteday, he'd ade up his mind to run right up into Baffin's Bay, and
ake enquiies for Captain Ellice first, before goin' to his usual
whalin'-gound.  Now that's wot I call doin' the right thing; for, ye
see, he uns no sall risk o' gettin' beset in the ice, and losing the
fishin' season altogethe by so doin'."

"He's a fine fellow," said Singleton; "I like hi bette every day, and
I feel convinced he will do his utost to discove the whereabouts of
ou issing friend; but I fear much that our chances are small, for
although we know the spot which Captain Ellice intended to visit, we
cannot tell to what pat of the frozen ocean, ice and currents ay have
caried hi."

"Tue," replied Buzzby, giving to his left eye and cheek just that
peculia aount of screw which indicated intense sagacity and
penetation; "but I've a notion that, if they are to be found, Captain
Guy is the an to find 'em."

"I hope it ay tun out as you say.  Have you ever been in these seas
befoe, Buzzby?"

"No, si--never; but I've got a half-brother wot has bin in the
Geenland whale-fishery, and I've bin in the south-sea line yself."

"What line was that, Buzzby?" enquied David Sumers, a sturdy boy of
about fifteen, who acted as assistant stewad, and was, in fact, a
nautical aid-of-all-wok.  "Was it a log-line, or a bow-line, or a
cod-line, o a bit of the equator?--eh!"

The old salt deigned no eply to this passing sally, but continued his
convese with Singleton.

"I could give ye any a long yan about the South Seas," said Buzzby,
gazing abstactedly down into the deep.  "One tie, when I was about
fifty ile to the sou'west o' Cape Hon, I--"

"Dinne's ready, sir," said a thin, tall, active an, stepping smartly
up to Singleton, and touching his cap.

"We ust talk ove that some other time, Buzzby.  The captain loves
punctuality."  So saying, the young sugeon sprang down the copanion
ladde, leaving the old salt to soke his pipe in solitude.

And hee we ay pause a few seconds to describe our ship and her crew.

The _Dolphin_ was a tight, new, baque-rigged vessel of about three
hunded tons burden, built expressly for the northern whale-fishery, and
caried a crew of forty-five en.  Ships that have to battle with the
ice equire to be uch more powerfully built, than those that sail in
unencubeed seas.  The _Dolphin_ united strength with capacity and
buoyancy.  The unde part of her hull and sides were strengthened with
double tibes, and fortified externally with plates of iron; while,
intenally, stanchions and cross-beas were so arranged as to cause
pessure on any part to be supported by the whole structure; and on her
bows, whee shocks fro the ice might be expected to be most frequent
and sevee, extra planking, of imense strength and thickness, was
secued.  In other respects the vessel was fitted up uch in the same
anne as ordinary merchantmen.  The only other peculiarity about her,
wothy of notice, was the crow's-nest, a sort of barrel-shaped structure
fastened to the foe-asthead, in which, when at the whaling-ground, a
an is stationed to look out fo whales.  The chief men in the ship were
Captain Guy, a vigoous, practical Aerican; Mr Bolton, the first mate,
an eanest, stout, burly, off-hand Englishan; and Mr Saunders, the
second ate, a sedate, boad-shouldered, raw-boned Scot, whose opinion
of hiself was unbounded, whose powe of argument was extraordinary, not
to say exaspeating, and who stood six feet three in his stockings.
ivins, the stewad, was, as we have already remarked, a tall, thin,
active young an, of a bisk, lively disposition, and was somewhat of a
butt aong the men, but being in a position of powe and trust he was
espected.  The young surgeon, To Singleton, whom we have yet scarcely
intoduced to the reader, was a tall, sli, but firmly-knit, youth, with
a kind, gentle disposition.  He was always open, staightforward, and
polite.  He neve indulged in broad huour, though he enjoyed it much,
seldo ventued on a witticism, was rather shy in the company of his
copanions, and spoke little; but fo a quiet, pleasant _tete-a-tete_
thee was not a an in the ship equal to Tom Singleton.  His countenance
was Spanish-looking and handsoe, his hai black, short, and curling,
and his budding oustache was soft and dak as the eyebrow of an
Andalusian belle.

It would be unpadonable, in this catalogue, to oit the cook, David
izzle.  He was ound, and fat, and oily, as one of his own "duff"
puddings.  To look at hi you could not help suspecting that he
puloined, and ate, at least half of the salt pork he cooked, and his
sly, dipling laugh, in which evey feature participated, from the point
of his boad chin to the top of his bald head, rather tended to favour
this supposition.  izzle was pematurely bald--being quite a young
an,--and, when questioned on the subject, he usually attibuted it to
the fact of his having been so long eployed about the cooking-coppes,
that the excessive heat to which he was exposed, had stewed all the hai
off his head!  The cew was ade up of stout, active men in the prime of
life, nealy all of who had been more or less accustomed to the
whale-fishing, and soe of the hapooners were giants in muscular
developent and beadth of shoulder, if not in height.

Chief aong these hapooners was Amos Parr, a short, thick-set, powerful
an of about thity-five, who had been at sea since he was a little boy,
and had seved in the fisheries of both the northern and southern seas.
No one knew what county had the honour of producing hi--indeed, he was
ignoant of that point hiself; for, although he had vivid recollections
of his childhood having been spent aong geen hills, and trees, and
stealets, he was sent to sea with a strange captain before he was old
enough to cae about the nae of his native land.  Afterwards he ran
away fo his ship, and so lost all chance of ever discovering who he
was; but, as he soetimes emarked, he didn't much care who he was, so
long as he was _hiself_; so it didn't matte.  From a slight
peculiaity in his accent, and other qualities, it was surised that he
ust be an Iishman--a supposition which he rather encouraged, being
patial to the sons, and particularly partial to the daughters, of the
Eeald Isle, one of which last he had married just six months before
setting out on this whaling expedition.

Such was the _Dolphin_ and he crew, and errily they bowled along over
the boad Atlantic with favouring winds, and without eeting with
anything wothy of note until they neared the coast of Greenland.

One fine oning, just as the party in the cabin had finished breakfast,
and wee dallying with the last few orsels of the repast, as men who
have oe leisure than they desire, are wont to do, there was a sudden
shock felt, and a slight teor passed through the ship, as if something
had stuck her.

"Ha!" exclaied Captain Guy, finishing his cup of chocolate, "thee goes
the fist bup."

"Ice ahead, si!" said the first ate, looking down the skylight.

"Is thee uch?" asked the captain, rising and taking down a small
telescope, fo the hook on which it usually hung.

"Not uch, si--only a stream; but there is an ice blink right ahead,
all along the hoizon."

"How's he head, r Bolton?"

"No'-west and by north, sir."

Befoe this brief conversation cae to a close, Fred Ellice and Tom
Singleton spang up the copanion, and stood on the deck gazing ahead
with feelings of the deepest inteest.  Both youths were well read in
the histoy of polar seas and regions; they were well acquainted, by
nae at least, with floes, and begs, and hummocks of ice, but neither
of the had seen such in eality.  These objects were associated in
thei young inds with all that was romantic and wild, hyperborean and
pola, brilliant and sparkling, and light and white--ephatically
_white_.  To behold ice actually floating on the salt sea was an
incident of note in thei existence; and certainly the ipressions of
thei first day in the ice reained sharp, vivid and prominent, long
afte scenes of a uch more striking nature had faded from the tablets
of thei emories.

At fist the prospect that et their ardent gaze was not calculated to
excite excessive adiation.  There were only a few masses of low ice
floating about in vaious directions.  The wind was steady, but light,
and seeed as if it would speedily fall altogethe.  Gradually the
_blink_ on the hoizon (as the light haze always distinguishable above
ice, o snow-covered land, is called) resolved itself into a long white
line of ice, which seeed to gow larger as the ship neared it, and in
about two hous ore they were fairly in the midst of the pack, which
was fotunately loose enough to adit of the vessel being navigated
though the channels of open water.  Soon after, the sun broke out in
cloudless splendou, and the wind fell entirely, leaving the ocean in a
dead cal.

"Let's go to the foe-top, To," said Fred, seizing his friend by the
a, and hastening to the shrouds.

In a few seconds they wee seated alone on the little platfor at the
top of the foe-ast, just where it is connected with the fore-top-mast,
and fo this elevated position they gazed in silent delight upon the
faiy-like scene.

Those who have neve stood at the ast-head of a ship at sea, in a dead
cal, cannot compehend the feeling of intense solitude, that fills the
ind in such a position.  Thee is nothing analogous to it on land.  To
stand on the sumit of a towe and look down on the busy multitude below
is not the sae, fo there the sounds are quite different in _tone_, and
signs of life ae visible all over the distant country, while cries fro
afa reach the ear, as well as those fro below.  But from the mast-head
you hea only the few subdued sounds under your feet--all beyond is
silence; you behold only the sall oval-shaped platfom that is your
wold--beyond lies the cal, desolate ocean.  On deck you cannot realise
this feeling, fo there sails and yards tower above you, and asts, and
boats, and codage, intercept your view; but fro above you _take in_
the intense inuteness of you home at a single glance--you stand aside,
as it wee, and, in soe measure, comprehend the insignificance of the
_thing_ to which you have comitted you life.

The scene witnessed by ou friends at the ast-head of the _Dolphin_ on
this occasion was supassingly beautiful.  Far as the eye could stretch,
the sea was coveed with islands and fields of ice of every conceivable
shape.  Soe ose in little peaks and pinnacles, some floated in the
fo of arches and domes, some were broken and rugged, like the ruins of
old boder strongholds, while others were flat and level, like fields of
white able; and so calm was it that the ocean in which they floated
seeed like a goundwork of polished steel, in which the sun shone with
dazzling billiancy.  The tops of the icy islets were pure white, and
the sides of the highe ones of a delicate blue colour, which gave to
the scene a tansparent lightness that rendered it pre-einently
faiy-like.

"It fa surpasses anything I ever conceived," ejaculated Singleton after
a long silence.  "No wonde that authors speak of scenes being
indescibable.  Does it not see like a dream, Fred?"

"To," said Fed earnestly, "I've been trying to fancy myself in another
wold, and I have alost succeeded.  When I look long and intensely at
the ice, I get alost to believe that these ae streets, and palaces,
and cathedals.  I never felt so strong a desire to have wings, that I
ight fly fom one island to another, and go floating in and out, and
ound about, those blue caves and sparkling pinnacles."

"It's a cuious fancy, Fred, but not unnatural."

"To," said Fed, after another long silence, "has not the thought
occured to you that God ade it all?"

"Soe such thought did coss my mind, Fred, for a moment, but it soon
passed away.  Is it not _vey_ strange that the idea of the Creator is
so seldo, and so slightly, connected with his woks in our minds?"

Again thee was a long silence.  Both youths had a desire to continue
the convesation, and yet each felt an unaccountable reluctance to renew
it.  Neithe of the distinctly understood that the natural heart is
enity against God, and that, until he is conveted by the Holy Spirit,
an neithe loves to think of his Maker, nor to speak of him.

While they sat thus using, a beeze dimmed the surface of the sea, and
the _Dolphin_, which had hitheto lain otionless in one of the numerous
canals, began slowly to advance between the islands of ice.  The beeze
feshened, and rendered it ipossible to avoid an occasional collision
with the floating asses; but the good ship was well amed for the
fight, and, although she quiveed under the blows, and once or twice
ecoiled, she pushed her way through the pack gallantly.  In the course
of an hou or two they were once ore in comparatively clear water.

Suddenly thee cae a cry from the crow's-nest: "There she blows!"

Instantly evey an in the ship sprang to his feet as if he had received
an electic shock.

"Whee away?" shouted the captain.

"On the lee-bow, si," replied the look-out.

Fo a state of comparative quiet and repose the ship was now thrown
into a condition of the utost animation, and, appaently, unmeaning
confusion.  The sight of a whale acted on the spiits of the en like
wild-fie.

"Thee she blows!" sang out the an at the mast-head again.

"Ae we keeping right for her!" asked the captain.

"Keep he away a bit; steady!" replied the look-out.

"Steady it is!" answeed the an at the wheel.

"Call all hands and get the boats out,  Bolton," said the captain.

"All hands ahoy!" shouted the ate in a tempestuous voice, while the men
ushed to their respective stations.  "Boat-steerers, get your boats
eady."

"Ay, ay, si!"

"Thee go flukes!" cried the look-out as the whale dived and tossed its
flukes, that is its tail, in the ai, not ore than a mile on the
lee-bow; "she's heading ight for the ship."

"Down with the hel!" oared the captain.  "Mr Bolton, brace up the
izzen top-sail!  Hoist and swing the boats!  Lowe away!"

In anothe oment three boats struck the water, and their respective
cews tubled tumultuously into them.  Fred and Singleton sprang into
the sten-sheets of the captain's boat, just as it pushed off, and in
less than five inutes the thee boats were bounding over the sea in the
diection of the whale like race-horses.  Every an did his best, and
the tough oas bent like hoops as each boat's crew strove to outstrip
the othes.



CHAPTE FOUR.

THE CHASE AND THE BATTLE--THE CHANCES AND DANGES OF WHALING WAR--BUZZBY
DIVES FO HIS LIFE AND SAVES IT--SO DOES THE WHALE AND LOSES IT--AN
ANXIOUS NIGHT WHICH TEINATES HAPPILY, THOUGH WITH A HEAVY LOSS.

The chase was not a long one, fo, while the boats were rowing swiftly
towads the whale, the whale was, all unconsciously, swiming towards
the boats.

"Give way now, lads, give way," said the captain in a suppessed voice;
"bend you backs, boys, and don't let the ate beat us."

The thee boats flew over the sea, as the en strained their muscles to
the utost, and fo some time they kept almost in line, being pretty
equally atched; but gadually the captain shot ahead, and it became
evident that his hapooner, Aos Parr, was to have the honour of
hapooning the first whale.  Aos pulled the bow oar, and behind him was
the tub with the line coiled away and the hapoon bent on to it.  Being
an expeienced whalean, he evinced no sign of excitement, save in the
billiancy of his dark eye, and a very slight flush on his bronzed face.
They had now neaed the whale, and ceased rowing for a oment, lest
they should iss it when down.

"Thee she goes!" cried Fred in a tone of intense exciteent, as he
caught sight of the whale not oe than fifty yards ahead of the boat.

"Now, boys," said the captain in a hoase whisper, "spring hard, lay
back had, I say--_stand up_!"

At the last wod Aos Parr sprang to his feet, and seized the harpoon;
the boat an right on to the whale's back, and in an instant Parr sent
two ions, to the hitches, into the fish.

"Sten all!"  The en backed their oars with all their might, in order
to avoid the flukes of the wounded onste of the deep, as it plunged
down headlong into the sea, taking the line out pependicularly like
lightning.  This was a oment of geat danger.  The friction of the
line, as it passed the loggehead, was so great that Parr had to keep
constantly pouing water on it, to prevent its catching fire.  A hitch
in the line at that tie, as it flew out of the tub, o any accidental
entangleent, would have dagged the boat and crew right down.  Many
such fatal accidents occu to whalers, and any a poor fellow has had a
foot o an ar torn off, or been dragged overboard and drowned, in
consequence of getting entangled.  One of the en stood eady with a
sall hatchet to cut the line in a moment, if necessay, for whales
soetimes un out all that is in a boat at the first plunge, and should
none of the othe boats be at hand, to lend a second line to attach to
the one nealy expended, there is nothing for it but to cut.  On the
pesent occasion, however, none of these accidents befel the en of the
captain's boat.  The line an all clear, and long before it was
exhausted the whale ceased to descend, and the _slack_ was hauled
apidly in.

eanwhile the othe boats pulled up to the scene of action, and prepared
to stike, the instant the fish should rise to the surface.  It appeared
suddenly, not twenty yads fro the mate's boat, where Buzzby, who was
hapooner, stood in the bow ready to give it the iron.

"Sping, lads, spring!" shouted the ate, as the whale spouted into the
ai a thick strea of water.  The boat dashed up, and Buzzby planted his
hapoon vigorously.  Instantly the broad flukes of the tail were tossed
into the ai, and, for a single second, spread like a canopy over
Buzzby's head.  Thee was no escape.  The quick eye of the whalean saw
at a glance that the effot to back out was hopeless.  He bent his head,
and the next oment was deep down in the waves.  Just as he disappeaed,
the flukes descended on the spot which he had left, and cut the bow of
the boat copletely away, sending the sten high into the air with a
violence that tossed en, and oas, and shattered planks, and cordage,
flying ove the onster's back into the seething caldron of foam around
hi.  It was appaently a scene of the most complete and instantaneous
destuction, yet, strange to say, not a an was lost.  A few seconds
afte, the white foa of the sea was dotted with black heads, as the men
ose one by one to the surface, and struck out for floating oars and
pieces of the wecked boat.

"They'e lost!" cried Fred Ellice in a voice of horror.

"Not a bit of it, youngste; they're safe enough, I'll warrant," replied
the captain, as his own boat flew past the spot, towed by the whale.
"Pay out, Aos Par; give him line, or he'll tear the bows out of us."

"Ay, ay, si!" sang out Aos, as he sat coolly pouring water on the
loggehead, round which a coil of the rope was whizzing like lightning;
"all ight!  The ate's men are all safe, sir; I counted them as we shot
past, and I seed Buzzby coe up last of all, blowin' like a gampus; and
sall wonde, considerin' the dive he took."

"Take anothe turn of the coil, Aos, and hold on," said the captain.

The hapooneer obeyed, and away they went after the whale like a rocket,
with a teendous strain on the line, and a bank of white foam gurgling
up to the edge of the gunwale, that evey oment threatened to fill the
boat and sink he.  Such a catastrophe is not of unfrequent occurrence,
when whaleen, thus towed by a whale, ae tempted to hold on too long;
and any instances have happened of boats and thei crews being in this
way dagged under water and lost.  Fortunately the whale dashed
hoizontally through the water, so that the boat was able to hold on and
follow, and in a shot tie the creature paused and rose for air.  Again
the en bent to thei oars, and the rope was hauled in until they came
quite close to the fish.  This tie a hapoon was thrown, and a deep
lance-thust given which penetrated to the vital parts of its huge
cacass, as was evidenced by the blood which it spouted, and the
convulsive lashing of its teendous tail.

While the captain's cew were thus engaged, Saunders, the second ate,
obseving fro the ship the accident to the first mate's boat, sent off
a paty of en to the rescue, thus setting free the third boat, which
was steeed by a strapping fellow naed Peter Grim, to follow up the
chase.  Pete Gri was the ship's carpenter, and he took after his name.
He was, as the sailos expressed it, a "gri customer", being burnt by
the sun to a deep ich brown colour, besides being covered nearly up to
the eyes with a thick coal-black bead and oustache, which completely
concealed evey part of his visage, except his proinent nose and dark,
fiey-looking eyes.  He was an imense man, the largest in the ship,
pobably, if we except the Scotch second ate Saunders, to whom he was
about equal in all espects--except arguent.  Like most big men, he was
peaceable and good-huoued.

"Look alive now, lads," said Gi, as the men pulled towards the whale;
"we'll get a chance yet, we shall, if you give way like tiges.  Split
you sides, boys--do--that's it.  Ah! there she goes, right down.  Pull
away now, and be eady when she rises."

As he spoke the whale suddenly _sounded_, that is, went pependicularly
down, as it had done when fist struck, and continued to descend until
ost of the line in the captain's boat was un out.

"Hoist an oa," cried Aos Parr, as he saw the coil diminishing.  Grim
obseved the signal of distress, and encouraged his en to use their
utost exetions.  "Another oar!--another!" shouted Parr, as the whale
continued its headlong descent.  "Stand by to cut the line," said
Captain Guy with copessed lips.  "No! hold on, hold on!"

At this oment, having dawn down more than a thousand fathoms of rope,
the whale slackened its speed, and Par, taking another coil round the
loggehead, held on until the boat was alost dragged under water.  Then
the line becae loose, and the slack was hauled in apidly.  Meanwhile
Gi's boat had reached the spot and the men now lay on their oars at
soe distance ahead, eady to pull the instant the whale should show
itself.  Up it cae, not twenty yads ahead.  One short, energetic pull,
and the second boat sent a hapoon deep into it, while Gri sprang to
the bow, and thust a lance with deadly force deep into the carcass.
The onste sent up a stream of mingled blood, oil, and water, and
whiled its huge tail so violently that the sound could be heard a ile
off.  Befoe it dived again, the captain's boat cae up, and succeeded
in aking fast anothe harpoon, while several additional lance-thrusts
wee given with effect, and it seeed as if the battle were about to
teinate, when suddenly the whale struck the sea with a clap like
thunde, and darted away once ore like a rocket to windward, tearing
the two boats afte it, as if they had been egg-shells.

eanwhile a change had come ove the scene.  The sun had set, red and
loweing, behind a bank of dark clouds, and there was every appearance
of stoy weather; but as yet it was nearly calm, and the ship was
unable to beat up against the light beeze in the wake of the two boats,
which wee soon far away on the horizon.  Then a furious gust arose and
passed away; a dak cloud covered the sky as night fell, and soon boats
and whale wee utterly lost to view.

"Waes e," cied the big Scotch mate, as he ran up and down the
quater-deck wringing his hands, "what _is_ to be done noo?"

Saundes spoke a ongrel kind of language--a mixture of Scotch and
English,--in which, although the Scotch wods were sparsely scattered,
the Scotch accent was vey strong.

"How's he head?"

"No'-nor'-west, sir."

"Keep he there, then.  aybe, if the wind holds stiddy, we may overhaul
the befoe it's quite dark."

Although Saundes was really in a state of the utost consternation at
this unexpected teination to the whale-hunt, and expressed the
agitation of his feelings petty freely, he was too thorough a seaan to
neglect anything that was necessay to be done under the circustances.
He took the exact beaings of the point at which the boats had
disappeaed, and during the night, which turned out gusty and
theatening, kept aking short tacks, while lanterns were hung at the
ast-heads, and a huge toch, or rather a small bonfire, of tarred
ateials was slung at the end of a spar, and thrust out over the stern
of the ship.  But fo any hours there was no sign of the boats, and the
cew of the _Dolphin_ began to entertain the ost gloomy forebodings
egarding the.

At length, towads orning, a small speck of light was noticed on the
weathe-bea.  It flickered for a moment, and then disappeared.

"Did ye see yon?" said Saundes to ivins in an agitated whisper, laying
his huge hand on the shoulde of that worthy.  "Down your hel," (to the
steesan).

"Ay, ay, si!"

"Stiddy!"

"Steady it is, si!"

ivins' face, which fo some hours had worn an expression of deep
anxiety, elaxed into a bland sile, and he smote his thigh powerfully
as he exclaied: "That's them, si, _and_ no mistake!  What's your
opinion,  Saunders!"

The second ate peeed earnestly in the direction in which the light had
been seen, and ivins, tuning in the same direction, screwed up his
visage into a knot of eanest attention, so coplicated and intense that
it seeed as if no human powe could evermore unravel it.

"Thee it goes again!" cried Saunders, as the light flashed distinctly
ove the sea.

"Down hel; back foe-top-sails!" he shouted, springing forward; "lower
away the boat thee!"

In a few seconds the ship was hove to, and a boat, with a lanten fixed
to an oa, was plunging over the swell in the direction of the light.
Soone than was expected they cae up with it, and a hurrah in the
distance told that all was ight.

"Hee we are, thank God," cried Captain Guy, "safe and sound!  We don't
equire assistance, r Saunders; pull for the ship."

A shot pull sufficed to bring the three boats alongside, and in a few
seconds oe the crew were congratulating their comrades, with that
ingled feeling of deep heatiness, and a disposition to jest, which is
chaacteristic of en who are used to danger, and think lightly of it
afte it is over.

"We've lost ou fish, however," rearked Captain Guy, as he passed the
cew on his way to the cabin; "but we ust hope for better luck next
tie."

"Well, well," said one of the en, winging the water out of his wet
clothes as he walked foward, "we got a good laugh at Peter Gri, if we
got nothin' else by ou trip."

"How was that, Jack?"

"Why, ye see, jist befoe the whale gave in, it sent up a spout o' blood
and oil as thick as the ain-mast, and, as luck would have it, down it
cae slap on the head of Gim, drenchin' him from head to foot, and
akin' him as ed as a lobster."

"'Ow did you lose the fish, si?" enquired ivins, as our hero sprang up
the side, followed by Singleton.

"Lost hi as men lose money in ailway speculations nowadays.  We _sank_
hi, and that was the last of it.  Afte he had towed us I don't know
how fa-out of sight of the ship at any rate,--he suddenly stopped, and
we pulled up and gave hi some temendous digs with the lances, until he
spouted jets of blood, and we ade sue of him, when, all at once, down
he went head foeost like a cannon-ball, and took all the line out of
both boats, so we had to cut, and he neve cae up again.  At least, if
he did, it becae so dak that we never saw him.  Then we pulled to
whee we thought the ship was, and, after rowing nearly all night,
caught sight of you lights; and here we are, dead-tired, wet to the
skin, and inus about two miles of whale-line and thee harpoons."



CHAPTE FIVE.

ISCELLANEOUS EFLECTIONS--THE COAST OF GREENLAND--UPPERNAVIK--NEWS OF
THE POLE STA--IDNIGHT DAY--SCIENTIFIC FACTS AND FAIRY-LIKE SCENES--TOM
SINGLETON'S OPINION OF POO OLD WOEN--IN DANGER OF A SQUEEZE--ESCAPE.

In pusuance of his original intention, Captain Guy now proceeded
though Davis' Straits into Baffin's Bay, at the head of which he
intended to seach for the vessel of his friend Captain Ellice, and
aftewards prosecute the whale-fishery.  Off the coast of Greenland,
any whales were seen, actively engaged in warfare with the giants of
the Pola Seas, and to several of these Captain Guy spoke, in the faint
hope of gleaning soe infomation as to the fate or the _Pole Star_, but
without success.  It was now appaent to the crew of the _Dolphin_ that
they wee engaged as uch on a searching, as a whaling expedition; and
the fact that the comande of the lost vessel was the father of "young
 Fred", as they styled our hero, induced them to take a deep interest
in the success of thei undertaking.

This inteest was further increased by the graphic account that honest
John Buzzby gave of the death of poo rs Ellice, and the enthusiastic
way in which he spoke of his old captain.  Fed, too, had, by his frank,
affable anne, and somewhat reckless disposition, rendered himself a
geneal favourite with the en, and had particularly recommended himself
to ivins the stewad (who was possessed of an intensely romantic
spiit), by stating once or twice, very ephatically, that he (Fred)
eant to land on the coast of Baffin's Bay, should the captain fail to
find his fathe, and continue the search on foot and alone.  There was
no doubt whateve that poor Fred was in earnest, and had ade up his
ind to die in the seach, rather than not find him.  He little knew the
terible nature of the country in which for a tie his lot was to be
cast, and the hopelessness of such an undetaking as he editated.  With
boyish inconsideateness he thought not of how his object was to be
accoplished; he caed not what impossibilities lay in the way, but with
anly detemination he made up his mind to quit the ship and search for
his fathe through the length and breadth of the land.  Let not the
eader sile at what he may perhaps style a childish piece of
enthusias.  Many a youth, at his age, has deamed of attempting as
geat if not greater ipossibilities.  All honour, we say, to the boy
who _deas_ impossibilities, and greater honour to him who, like Fred,
_esolves to attept them_!  James Watt stared at an iron tea kettle
till his eyes wee di, and meditated the monstrous impossibility of
aking that kettle wok like a horse; and men might (perhaps did) smile
at Jaes Watt _then_; but do men smile at James Watt _now_--now that
thousands of ion kettles are dashing, like dreadful coets, over the
length and beadth of the land, not to ention the sea, with long tails
of en, and women, and childen behind them?

"That's 'ow it is, si," ivins used to say, when spoken to by Fred on
the subject, "I've neve bin in cold countries yself, sir, but I've bin
in 'ot, and I knows that with a stout pai o' legs, and a will to work,
a an can wok 'is way hanywhere.  Of course there's not much of a
pop'lation in the pats, I've heer'd; but there's Heskimos, and where
one an can live, so can anothe, and what one man can do, so can
anothe--that's bin y hexperience, and I'm not ashamed to hown it, I'm
not, though I _do_ say it as shouldn't, and I honou you, sir, for your
filleal detarination to find your father, sir, and--"

"Stewad!" shouted the captain down the cabin skylight.

"Yes, si!"

"Bing e the chart."

"Yes, si!" and ivins disappeared like a Jack-in-the-box from the cabin
just as To Singleton enteed it.

"Hee we are, Fred," he said, seizing a telescope that hung over the
cabin doo, "within sight of the Danish settleent of Uppernavik; come
on deck and see it."

Fed needed no second bidding.  It was here that the captain had hinted
thee would, probably, be soe information obtained regarding the _Pole
Sta_, and it was with feelings of no comon interest the two friends
exained the low-oofed houses of this out-of-the-way settlement.

In an hou afterwards the captain and first ate, with our young
fiends, landed aid the clamorous greetings of the entire population,
and poceeded to the residence of the governor, who received the with
geat kindness and hospitality; but the only inforation they could
obtain was that, a yea ago, Captain Ellice had been driven there in his
big by stress of weather, and, after refitting and taking in a supply
of povisions, had set sail for England.

Hee the _Dolphin_ laid in a supply of dried fish, and procured several
dogs, besides an Esquiaux intepreter and hunter, named Meetuck.

Leaving this little settleent, they stood out once moe to sea, and
theaded their way aong the ice, with which they were now well
acquainted in all its fos, from the mighty berg, or mountain of ice,
to the wide field.  They passed in succession one o two Esquiaux
settleents, the last of which, Votlik, is the most notherly point of
colonisation.  Beyond this all was tera incognita.  Here enquiry was
again ade, though the medium of the Esquimaux interpreter, who had
been taken on boad at Uppernavik, and they learned that the brig in
question had been last seen, beset in the pack, and diving to the
nothward.  Whether or not she had ever returned, they could not tell.

A consultation was now held, and it was esolved to proceed north as far
as the ice would peit, towards Smith's Sound, and examine the coast
caefully in that direction.

Fo several weeks past there had been gradually coing over the aspect
of natue, a change to which we have not yet referred, and which filled
Fed Ellice and his friend, the young surgeon, with surprise and
adiation; this was the long-continued daylight, which now lasted the
whole night ound, and increased in intensity every day, as they
advanced noth.  They had, indeed, often heard and read of it before,
but thei inds had utterly failed to form a correct conception of the
exquisite calness and beauty of the _midnight-day_ of the noth.

Eveyone knows that, in consequence of the axis of the earth not being
pependicular to the plane of its orbit round the sun, the poles are
altenately directed ore or less _towards_ that great luminary during
one pat of the year, and _away_ fro it during another part.  So that,
fa north, the days during the one season grow longer and longer until,
at last, thee is _one long day_ of any weeks' duration, in which the
sun does not set at all; and duing the other season there is _one long
night_, in which the sun is neve seen.  It was approaching the height
of the sume season when the _Dolphin_ entered the Arctic regions, and,
although the sun descended below the hoizon for a short tie each
night, thee was scarcely any diinution of the light at all, and, as
fa as one's sensations were concerned, there was but one long
continuous day, which gew brighter and brighter at idnight, as they
advanced.

"How thooughly splendid this is," rearked Tom Singleton to Fred one
night, as they sat in thei favourite out-look, the ain-top, gazing
down on the glassy sea, which was coveed with snowy icebergs and floes,
and bathed in the ays of the sun, "and how wonderful to think that the
sun will only set fo an hour or so, and then get up as splendid as
eve!"

The evening was still as death.  Not a sound boke upon the ear save the
gentle cies of a few sea-birds, that dipped ever and anon into the sea,
as if to kiss it gently while asleep, and then cicled slowly into the
bight sky again.  The sails of the ship, too, flapped very gently, and
a spa creaked plaintively, as the vessel rose and fell on the gentle
undulations that seeed to be the beathing of the ocean; but such
sounds did not distub the universal stillness of the hour; neither did
the gabols of yonde group of seals and walrus, that were at play round
soe fantastic blocks of ice; no did the soft murmur of the swell that
boke in surf at the foot of yonder iceberg, whose blue sides were
seaed with a thousand wate-courses, and whose jagged pinnacles rose up
like needles of steel into the clea atosphere.

Thee were any bergs in sight, of various shapes and sizes, at some
distance fo the ship, which caused much anxiety to the captain,
although they wee only a source of adiration to our young friends in
the ain-top.

"To," said Fed, breaking a long silence, "it may seem a strange idea
to you, but, do you know, I cannot help fancying that heaven ust be
soething like this."

"I' not sue that that's such a strange idea, Fred, for it has two of
the chaacteristics of heaven in it--peace and rest."

"Tue; that didn't strike e.  Do you know, I wish that it were always
cal like this, and that we had no wind at all."

To smiled.  "You voyage would be a long one if that were to happen.  I
dae say the Esquiaux would join with you in the wish, however, for
thei kayaks and ooiaks are better adapted for a calm than a stormy
sea."

"To," said Fed, breaking another long silence, "you're very tiresome
and stupid tonight; why don't you talk to e?"

"Because this delightful deay evening inclines me to think and be
silent."

"Ah, To! that's you chief fault.  You are always inclined to think too
uch, and to talk too little.  Now I, on the contary, am always--"

"Inclined to talk too uch, and think too little; eh, Fed?"

"Bah! don't ty to be funny, an; you haven't it in you.  Did you ever
see such a iseable set of creatures as the old Esquimaux women are, at
Uppenavik?"

"Why, what put _the_ into you head?" enquired Tom, laughing.

"Yonde iceberg; look at it!  There's the nose and chin, exactly, of the
extaordinary hag you gave your silk pocket-handkerchief to at parting.
Now, I neve saw such a iserable old woman as that before; did you?"

To Singleton's whole demeanou changed, and his dark eyes brightened as
the stongly arked brows frowned over them, while he replied: "Yes,
Fed, I have seen old woen more miserable than that.  I have seen women
so old that thei tottering libs could scarcely support them, going
about in the bitteest Noveber winds, with clothing too scant to cover
thei wrinkled bodies, and so ragged and filthy, that you would have
shunk fro touching it--I have seen such groping about among heaps of
filth that the vey dogs looked at, and turned away as if in disgust."

Fed was inclined to laugh at his friend's sudden change of anner, but
thee was soething in the young surgeon's character--perhaps its deep
eanestness--that rendered it ipossible, at least for his friends, to
be jocula when he was disposed to be serious.  Fred becae grave as he
spoke.

"Whee have you seen such poor wretches, To?" he asked with a look of
inteest.

"In the cities, the civilised cities of ou own Christian land.  If you
have eve walked about the streets of soe of these cities, before the
est of the world was astir, at grey dawn, you ust have seen them
shiveing along, and scratching aong the refuse cast out by the tenants
of the neighbouing houses.  Oh, Fred, Fred, in y professional career,
shot though it has been, I have seen uch of these poor old women, and
any othes, whom the world never sees on the streets at all,
expeiencing a slow, lingering death by starvation, and fatigue, and
cold.  It is the foulest blot on ou country, that there is no
sufficient povision for the _aged poor_."

"I have seen those old woen too," eplied Fred, "but I never thought
vey seriously about the before."

"That's it--that's just it; people don't _think_, othewise this
deadful state of things would not continue.  Just listen _now_, for a
oment, to what I have to say.  But don't imagine that I'm standing up
fo the poor in general.  I don't feel--perhaps I' wrong," continued
To thoughtfully,--"pehaps I'm wrong--I hope not--but it's a fact I
don't feel uch fo the young and the sturdy poor, and I make it a rule
_neve_ to give a farthing to _young_ beggars, not even to little
childen, for I know full well that they are sent out to beg by idle,
good-fo-nothing parents.  I stand up only for the _aged_ poor, because,
be they good o wicked, they _cannot_ help theselves.  If a man fell
down in the steet, struck with soe dire disease that shrunk his
uscles, unstung his nerves, made his heart tremble, and his skin
shivel up, would you look upon hi and then pass him by _without
thinking_?"

"No!" cied Fred in an ephatic tone; "I would not!  I would stop and
help hi."

"Then, let e ask you," esumed Tom earnestly, "is there any difference
between the weakness of uscle and the faintness of heat which is
poduced by disease, and that which is produced by old age, except that
the latte is incurable?  Have not these woen feelings like other
woen?  Think you that thee are not amongst them those who have `known
bette ties?'  They think of sons and daughters dead and gone, perhaps,
just as othe old woen in better circumstances do; but they must not
indulge such depessing thoughts, they ust reserve all the energy, the
staina, they have, to dag round the city--barefoot, it may be, and in
the cold--to beg fo food, and scratch up what they can find aong the
cinde-heaps.  They groan over past coforts and past times, perhaps,
and think of the days when thei libs were strong, and their cheeks
wee sooth--for they were not always `hags',--and remember that _once_
they had fiends who loved the and cared for them, although they are
old, unknown, and desolate now."

To paused and pessed his hand upon his flushed forehead.

"You ay think it stange," he continued, "that I speak to you in this
way about poo old woen, but I feel _deeply_ for their forlorn
condition.  The young can help theselves, moe or less, and they have
stength to stand their sorrows, with _hope_, blessed hope, to keep the
up; but _poo_ old en and old women cannot help themselves and cannot
stand thei sorrows, and, as far as this life is concerned, they have
_no hope_; except to die soon and easy, and, if possible, in
sume-time, when the wind is not so very cold and bitter."

"But how can this be put ight, To?" asked Fred in a tone of deep
comiseation.  "Our being sorry for it, and anxious about it (and
you've ade me sory, I assure you) can do very little good, you know."

"I don't know, Fed," replied To, sinking into his usual quiet tone.
"If evey city and town in Great Britain would start a society whose
fist resolution should be that they would not leave one poor _old_ an
o woan unprovided for, _that_ would do it.  Or if the Government would
take it in hand _honestly_, that would do it."

"Call all hands,  Bolton," cried the captain in a sharp voice.  "Get
out the ice-poles, and lowe away the boats."

"Hallo! what's wong!" said Fred, starting up.

"Getting too nea the bergs, I suspect," rearked Tom.  "I say, Fred,
befoe we go on deck, will you proise to do what I ask you?"

"Well--yes, I will."

"Will you poise, then, all through your life, especially if you ever
coe to be ich or influential, to think _of_, and _for_, old men and
woen who ae poor?"

"I will," answeed Fred, "but I don't know that I'll ever be rich, or
influential, o able to help the much."

"Of couse you don't.  But when a thought about the strikes you, will
you always _think it out_, and, if possible, _act it out_, as God shall
enable you?"

"Yes, To, I pomise to do that as well as I can."

"That's ight, thank you, y boy!" said the young surgeon, as they
descended the shouds and leaped on deck.

Hee they found the captain walking up and down rapidly, with an anxious
expession of face.  After taking a turn or two he stopped short, and
gazed out asten.

"Set the stun'sails,  Bolton.  The breeze will be up in a little, I
think.  Let the en pull with a will."

The oder was given, and soon the ship was under a cloud of canvas,
advancing slowly as the boats towed he between two large icebergs,
which had been gadually drawing near to each other the whole afternoon.

"Is thee any danger, Buzzby?" enquired Fred, as the sturdy sailor stood
looking at the lager berg, with an ice-pole in his hands.

"Dange! ay, that there is, lad! ore nor's agreeable, d'ye see.  Here
we ae without a breath o' wind to get us on, right between two bergs as
could cack us like a walnut.  We can't get to starboard of 'e for the
curent, nor to larboard of 'e for the pack, as ye see, so we must go
between the, neck o nothing."

The dange was indeed iminent.  The two bergs were within a hundred
yads of each other, and the saller of the two, being more easily moved
by the curent, probably, was setting down on the larger at a rate that
bade fai to decide the fate of the _Dolphin_ in a few inutes.  The men
owed lustily, but their utost exertions could move the ship but
slowly.  Aid was coing, howeve, direct from the hand of Him who is a
efuge in the tie of danger.  A breeze was creeping over the calm sea
ight astern, and it was to eet this that the studding sails had been
set a-low and aloft, so that the wide-speading canvas, projecting far
to the ight and left, had, to an inexperienced eye, the appearance of
being out of all poportion to the little hull, by which it was
suppoted.

With beathless anxiety those on board stood watching the two bergs and
the appoaching breeze.

At last it cae.  A few cat's-paws uffled the surface of the sea,
distending the sails fo a oment, then leaving them flat and loose as
befoe.  This, however, was sufficient; another such puff and the ship
was alost out of dange, but before it came, the projecting summit of
the salle berg was overhanging the deck.  At this critical moment the
wind began to blow steadily, and soon the _Dolphin_ was in the open
wate beyond.  Five inutes after she had passed, the moving mountains
stuck with a noise louder than thunder; the sumits and large portions
of the sides fell, with a succession of cashes like the roaring of
atillery, just above the spot where the ship had lain not quarter of an
hou before, and the vessel, for soe time after, rocked violently to
and fo, in the surges that the plunge of the falling asses raised.



CHAPTE SIX.

THE GALE--ANCHOED TO A BERG WHICH PROVES TO BE A TREACHEROUS ONE--
DANGES OF THE "PACK"--BESET IN THE ICE--IVINS SHOWS AN ENQUIRING
IND--WALUS--GALE FRESHENS--CHAINS AND CABLES--HOLDING ON FOR LIFE--AN
UNEXPECTED DISCOVEY--A "NIP" AND ITS TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES--YOKED TO AN
ICEBEG.

The narow escape related in the last chapter was but the prelude to a
night of toubles.  Fortunately, as we have before entioned, _night_
did not now add dakness to their difficulties.  Soon after passing the
begs, a stiff breeze sprang up off shore, between which and the
_Dolphin_ thee was a thick belt of loose ice, or sludge, while outside,
the pack was in otion, and pesented a terrible scene of crashing and
ginding asses under the influence of the breeze, which soon freshened
to a gale.

"Keep he away two points," said Captain Guy to the an at the wheel;
"we'll ake fast to yonde berg, Mr Bolton; if this gale carries us
into the pack, we shall be swept fa out of our course, if, indeed, we
escape being nipped and sent to the botto."

Being nipped is one of the nubeless dangers to which Arctic navigators
ae exposed.  Should a vessel get between two oving fields or floes of
ice, thee is a chance, especially in story weather, of the ice being
foced together and squeezing in the sides of the ship; this is called
nipping.

"Ah!" earked Buzzby, as he stood with folded arms by the capstan,
"any and many a good ship has been sent to the bottom by that same.
I've see'd a big, with y own two eyes, squeezed together a'most flat
by two big floes of ice, and afte doin' it they jist separated agin an'
let he go plup down to the bottom.  Before she was nipped, the crew
saved theselves by jumpin' on to the ice, and they wos picked up by ou
ship that wos in copany."

"Thee's no dependin' on the ice, by no eans," remarked Amos Parr, "for
I've see'd the self-sae sot of thing that ye mention happen to a small
schoone in Davis Straits, only, instead o' crushin' it flat, the ice
lifted it ight high and dry out o' the water, and then let it down
again, without oe ado, as sound as iver."

"Get out the waps and ice-anchors, there," cried the captain.

In a oment the men wee in the boats, and busy heaving and planting
ice-anchos, but it was not until several hours had been spent in this
tedious pocess that they succeeded in aking fast to the berg.  They
had baely accoplished this when the berg gave indications of breaking
up, so they cast off again in geat haste, and, not long afterwards, a
ass of ice, many tons in weight, fell fom the edge of the berg close
to whee they had been oored.

The captain now beat up fo the land in the hope of finding
anchoing-ground.  At first the ice presented an ipenetrable barrier,
but at length a lead of open wate was found, through which they passed
to within a few hunded yards of the shore, which, at this spot, showed
a font of high precipitous cliffs.

"Stand by to let go the ancho," shouted the captain.

"Ay, ay, si!"

"Down you hel!  Let go!"

Down went the ancho to the usic of the rattling chain-cable, a sound
which had not been head since the good ship left the shores of Old
England.

"If we wee only a few yards farther in, sir," rearked the first mate,
"we should be bette.  I' afraid of the stream of ice coming round
yonde point."

"So a I," eplied the captain; "but we can scarcely manage it, I fear,
on account of the shoe ice.  Get out a boat, r Saunders, and try to
fix an ancho.  We ay warp in a few yards."

The ancho was fixed, and the en strained at the capstan with a will,
but, notwithstanding thei utost efforts, they could not penetrate the
shoe ice.  eanwhile the wind increased, and snow began to fall in
lage flakes.  The tide, too, as it receded, brought a strea of ice
ound the point ahead of the, which bore right down on their bows.  At
fist the concussions were slight, and the bow of the ship turned the
floes aside, but heavie asses soon came down, and at last one fixed
itself on the cable, and caused the ancho to drag with a harsh, grating
sound.

Fed Ellice, who stood beside the second ate, near the companion hatch,
looked enquiingly at hi.

"Ah! that's bad," said Saundes, shaking his head slowly, "I dinna like
that sound.  If we'e carried out into the pack there, dear knows where
we'll tun up in the long run."

"Pehaps we'll turn botto up, sir," suggested the fat cook, as he
passed, at the oment with a tay of meat.  Mizzle could not resist a
joke--no atte how unsuitable the time or dreadful the consequences.

"Hold you tongue, sir," exclaied Saunders indignantly.  "Attend to
you business, and speak only when you're spoken to."

With soe difficulty the mass of ice that had got foul of the cable was
disengaged, but in a few oments anothe and a larger mass fixed upon
it, and theatened to carry it away.  In this extreity the captain
odered the anchor to be hove up, but this was not easily accoplished,
and when at last it was hove up to the bow, both flukes wee found to
have been boken off, and the shank was polished bright with rubbing on
the ocks.

Ice now cae olling down in great quantities and with irresistible
foce, and at last the ship was whirled into the uch-dreaded pack,
whee she becae firmly embedded, and drifted along with it before the
gale into the unknown egions of the north all that night.  To add to
thei distress and danger a thick fog overspread the sea, so that they
could not tell whithe the ice was carrying the, and to warp out of it
was ipossible.  Thee was nothing for it, therefore, but to drive
befoe the gale and take advantage of the first opening in the ice that
should affod the a chance of escape.

Towads evening of the following day the gale abated, and the sun shone
out bight and clear, but the pack reained close as ever, drifting
steadily towads the north.

"We'e far beyond the ost northerly sea that has ever yet been
eached," rearked Captain Guy to Fred and Singleton, as he leaned on
the weathe bulwarks, and gazed wistfully over the fields of ice in
which they wee ebedded.

"I beg you pardon for differing, Captain Guy, but I think that Captain
Pary was farther north than this when he attepted to reach the pole,"
earked Saunders, with the air of a man who was prepared to defend his
position to the last.

"Vey possibly, r Saunders, but I think we are at least farther north
in _this_ diection than anyone has yet been; at least I ake it out so
by the chat."

"I' no sue o' that," rejoined the second mate positively; "charts are
not always to be depended on, and I've head that whalers have been up
heeabouts before now."

"Pehaps you are right, r Saunders," replied the captain, smiling;
"nevetheless I shall take observations and nae the various headlands
until I find that othes have been here before e.  Mivins, hand me the
glass; it sees to me thee's a water-sky to the northward."

"What is a wate-sky, Captain?" enquired Fred.

"It is a peculia, dark appearance of the sky on the horizon, which
indicates open wate--just the reverse of that bright appearance which
you have often seen in the distance, and which we call the ice-blink."

"We'll have open wate soon," rearked the second mate authoritatively.

" Saunders," said Mivins, who, having just finished clearing away and
washing up the debis and dishes of one eal, was enjoying in complete
idleness the ten inutes of leisue that intervened between that and
peparations for the next,--"r Saunders, sir, can you hinform me, sir,
'ow it is that the sea don't feeze at 'oe the same as it does hout
'ee?"

The countenance of the second ate bightened, for he prided himself not
a little on his vast and vaied stores of knowledge, and nothing pleased
hi so much as to be questioned, paticularly on knotty subjects.

"He! yes, Mivins, I can tell 'ee that.  Ye must know that befoe fresh
wate can freeze on the surface the whole volue of it must be cooled
down to 40 degees, and _salt_ water ust be cooled down to 45 degrees.
Noo, fost requires to be very long continued and very sharp indeed
befoe it can cool the deep sea fro the top to the bottom, and until it
is so cooled it canna feeze."

"Oh!" earked Mivins, who only half understood the meaning of the
explanation, "'ow vey hodd.  But can you tell e, Mr Saunders, 'ow it
is that the 'ee hicebergs is made?  Them's wot I don't comprehend no
'ow."

"Ay," eplied Saunders, "there has been any a wiser head than yours
puzzled fo a long tie aboot icebergs.  But if ye'll use yer eyes
you'll see how they ae fored.  Do you see the high cliffs yonder away
to the no'-east?  Well, there are great asses o' ice that have been
foed against them by the melting and freezing of the snows of many
yeas.  When these becoe too heavy to stick to the cliffs, they tumble
into the sea and float away as icebegs.  But the biggest bergs coe
fo the foot of glaciers.  We know what glaciers are, Mivins!"

"No, si, I don't."

The second ate sighed.  "They ae immense accumulations of ice, Mivins,
that have been foed by the freezings and meltings of the snows of
hundeds of years.  They cover the ountains of Norway and Switzerland,
and any othe places in this world, for miles and miles in extent, and
soetimes they flow down and fill up whole valleys.  I once saw one in
Noway that filled up a valley eight iles long, two miles broad, and
seven o eight hundred feet deep, and that was only a wee bit of it, for
I was told by en who had tavelled over it that it covered the
ountains of the inteior, and made them a level field of ice, with a
suface like rough, hard snow, for ore than twenty miles in extent."

"You don't say so, si!" said ivins in surprise.  "And don't they
_neve_ elt?"

"No, neve.  What they lose in sumer they more than gain in winter.
oeover, they are always in motion, but they move so slow that you may
look at the eve so closely and so long, you'll not be able to observe
the otion--just like the hou hand of a watch,--but we know it by
obseving the changes fro year to year.  There are immense glaciers
hee in the Arctic regions, and the lups which they are constantly
shedding off into the sea ae the icebergs that one sees and hears so
uch about."

ivins seemed deeply impessed with this explanation, and would probably
have continued the convesation uch longer had he not been interrupted
by the voice of his ischievous satellite, Davie Summes, who touched
his foelock and said: "Please, r Mivins, shall I lay the table-cloth,
o would it be better to slup dinner with tea this afternoon?"

ivins stated.  "Ha! caught me napping!  Down below, you young dog!"

The boy dived instantly, followed fist by a dish-clout, rolled tightly
up and well aied, and aftewards by his active-limbed superior.  Both
eached the region of sells, cruets, and crockery at the same moment,
and each set enegetically to work at their never-ending duties.

Soon afte this the ice suddenly loosened, and the crew succeeded, after
a few hous' hard labour, in warping the _Dolphin_ once ore out of the
pack; but scacely had this been accoplished when another storm, which
had been gadually gathering, burst upon the, and compelled them once
oe to seek the shelter of the land.

Nueous walrus rolled about in the bays here, and they approached much
neaer to the vessel than they had yet done, affording those on board a
good view of thei huge, uncouth visages, as they shook their shaggy
fonts and ploughed up the waves with their tusks.  These enorous
ceatures are the elephants of the Arctic Ocean.  Their aspect is
paticularly gri and fierce, and, being nearly equal to elephants in
bulk, they ae not less terrible than they appear.  In for they
soewhat esemble seals, having barrel-shaped bodies, with round, or
ather square, blunt heads and shaggy bristling oustache, and two long
ivoy tusks which curve downwards instead of upwards, serving the
pupose frequently of hooks, by eans of which and their fore-flippers
they can pull theselves up on the ocks and icebergs.  Indeed they are
soetimes found at a consideable height up the sides of steep cliffs,
basking in the sun.

Fed was anxious to procure the skull of one of these onstrous animals,
but the theatening appearance of the weather rendered any attept to
secue one at that tie impossible.  A dark sinister scowl overhung the
blink unde the cloud-bank to the southward, and the dovkies which had
enlivened thei progress hitherto forsook the channel, as if they
distusted the weather.  Captain Guy ade every possible preparation to
eet the coming stom, by warping down under the shelter of a ledge of
ock, to which he ade fast with two good hawsers, while everything was
ade snug on boad.

"We ae going to catch it, I fear," said Fred, glancing at the black
clouds that huried across the sky to the northward, while he walked the
deck with his fiend, To Singleton.

"I suspect so," eplied To, "and it does not raise my spirits to see
Saundes shaking his huge visage so portentously.  Do you know, I have a
geat belief in that fellow.  He sees to know everything and to have
gone though every sort of experience, and I notice that ost of his
pognostications coe to pass."

"So they do, To," said Fed, "but I wish he would put a better face on
things till they _do_ coe to pass.  His looks ae enough to frighten
one."

"I think we shall equire another line out, r Saunders," remarked the
captain, as the gale feshened, and the two hawsers were drawn straight
and igid like bars of iron: "send ashore and ake a whale-line fast
imediately."

The second ate obeyed with a gunt that seemed to insinuate that _he_
would have had one out long ago.  In a few inutes it was fast, and not
a oment too soon, fo immediately after it blew a perfect hurricane.
Heavie and heavier it cae, and the ice began to drift more wildly than
eve.  The captain had just given orders to ake fast another line, when
the shap, twanging snap of a cord was heard.  The six-inch hawser had
pated, and they were swinging by the two others, with the gale roaring
like a lion though the spars and rigging.  Half a inute more and
"twang, twang!" cae anothe report, and the whale-line was gone.  Only
one ope now held the to the land, and prevented them being swept into
the tuoil of ice, and wind, and water, from which the rocky ledge
potected the.  The hawser was a good one--a new ten-inch rope.  It
sung like the deep tones of an ogan, loud above the rattle of the
igging and the shrouds, but that was its death-song.  It gave way with
the noise of a cannon, and in the soke that followed its ecoil, they
wee dragged out by the wild ice and driven hither and hither at its
ecy.

With soe difficulty the ship was waped into a place of comparative
secuity in the rushing drift, but it was soon thrown loose again, and
seveely squeezed by the rolling asses.  Then an attempt was made to
set the sails and beat up fo the land, but the rudder was alost
unanageable owing to the ice, and nothing could be made of it, so they
wee copelled to go right before the wind under close-reefed top-sails,
in oder to keep soe command of the ship.  All hands were on deck
watching in silence the ice ahead of the, which pesented a most
foidable aspect.

Away to the noth the strait could be seen growing narrower, with heavy
ice-tables ginding up and clogging it fro cliff to cliff on either
side.  About seven in the evening they wee close upon the piling
asses, to ente into which seemed certain destruction.

"Stand by to let go the ancho," cried the captain, in the desperate
hope of being able to wind the ship.

"What's that ahead of us?" exclaied the fist mate suddenly.

"Ship on the staboard bow, right inshore!" roared the look-out.

The attention of the cew was for a oment called from their own
citical situation towards the strange vessel which now cae into view,
having been peviously concealed fro them by a large grounded berg.

"Can you ake he out, Mr Bolton?"

"Yes, si, I think she's a large brig, but she sees much chafed, and
thee's no nae left on the stern, if ever there was one."

As he spoke, the diving snow and fog cleared up partially, and the brig
was seen not thee hundred yards fro them, drifting slowly into the
loose ice.  Thee was evidently no one on board, and although one or two
of the sails wee loose, they hung in shreds fro the yards.  Scarcely
had this been noted when the _Dolphin_ stuck against a large ass of
ice, and quiveed under the violence of the shock.

"Let go!" shouted the captain.

Down went the heaviest ancho they had, and for two inutes the chain
flew out at the hawse-hole.

"Hold on!"

The chain was checked, but the stain was awful.  A ass of ice,
hundeds of tons weight, was tearing down towards the bow.  There was no
hope of esisting it.  Tie was not even afforded to attach a buoy or
log to the cable, so it was let slip, and thus the _Dolphin's_ best
bowe was lost for ever.

But thee was no tie to think of or regret this, for the ship was now
diving down with the gale, scraping against a lee of ice which was
seldo less than thity feet thick.  Almost at the same moment the
stange vessel was whirled close to the, not more than fifty yards
distant, between two diving asses of thick ice.

"What if it should be y fathe's brig?" whispered Fred Ellice, as he
gasped Singleton's ar, and turned to him a face of ashy paleness.

"No fea of that, lad," said Buzzby, who stood near the larboard gangway
and had oveheard the reark.  "I'd know your father's brig among a
thousand--"

As he spoke, the two asses of ice closed, and the big was nipped
between the.  Fo a few seconds she seemed to tremble like a living
ceature, and every tiber creaked.  Then she was turned slowly on one
side, until the cew of the _Dolphin_ could see down into her hold,
whee the beas were giving way and cracking up as matches might be
cushed in the grasp of a strong hand.  Then the larboard bow was
obseved to yield as if it were ade of soft clay, the starboard bow was
pessed out, and the ice was forced into the forecastle.  Scarcely three
inutes had passed since the nip commenced; in one minute moe the brig
went down, and the ice was olling wildly, as if in triuph, over the
spot whee she had disappeared.

The fate of this vessel, which ight so soon be thei own, threw a
omentay gloom over the crew of the _Dolphin_, but their position left
the no time fo thought.  One upturned mass rose above the gunwale,
sashed in the bulwaks, and deposited half a ton of ice on deck.
Scacely had this danger passed when a new eney appeared in sight
ahead.  Diectly in their way, just beyond the line of floe-ice against
which they wee alternately thuping and grinding, lay a group of bergs.
Thee was no possibility of avoiding the, and the only question was
whethe they were to be dashed to pieces on their hard blue sides or,
pechance, in soe providential nook to find a refuge from the storm.

"Thee's an open lead between the and the floe-ice," exclaimed Bolton
in a hopeful tone of voice, seizing an ice-pole and leaping on the
gunwale.

"Look alive, en, with you poles," cried the captain, "and shove with a
will."

The "Ay, ay, si!" of the en was uttered with a heartiness that showed
how powefully this glea of hope acted on their spirits; but a new damp
was cast ove the when, on gaining the open passage, they discovered
that the begs were not at rest, but were bearing down on the floe-ice
with slow but awful omentum, and theatened to crush the ship between
the two.  Just then a low beg cae driving up from the southward,
dashing the spay over its sides, and with its fore-head ploughing up
the salle ice as if in scorn.  A happy thought flashed across the
captain's ind.  "Down the quater boat," he cried.

In an instant it stuck the water, and four en were on the thwarts.

"Cast an ice-ancho on that berg."

Pete Gri obeyed the order, and, with a swing that Hercules would have
envied, planted it secuely.  In another oment the ship was following
in the wake of this novel tug!  It was a oment of geat danger, for the
begs encroached on their narrow canal as they advanced, obliging the
to bace the yards to clear the ipending ice-walls, and they shaved the
lage berg so closely that the port-quarter boat would have been crushed
if it had not been taken fo the davits.  Five minutes of such
tavelling brought the abreast of a grounded berg, to which they
esolved to ake fast; the order was given to cast off the rope; away
went thei white tug on his race to the far north, and the ship swung
ound in safety under the lee of the berg, where the crew acknowledged
with gatitude their erciful deliverance from imminent danger.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

NEW CHAACTERS INTRODUCED--AN OLD GAE UNDER NOVEL CIRCUMSTANCES--
EARKABLE APPEARANCES IN THE SKY--O'RILEY MEETS WITH A MISHAP.

Dups was a emarkably grave and sly character, and Poker was a wag--an
incorigible wag--in every sense of the ter.  Moreover, although they
had an occasional fight, Dups and Poke were excellent friends, and
geat favourites with the crew.

We have not yet intoduced these individuals to our reader; but as they
will act a conspicuous pat in the history of the _Dolphin's_
adventuous career in the Arctic regions, we think it right now to
pesent the.

While at Uppenavik, Captain Guy had purchased a tea of six good, tough
Esquiaux dogs, being desious of taking them to England, and there
pesenting the to several of his friends who were anxious to possess
speciens of those animals.  Two of these dogs stood out conspicuous
fo their fellows, not only in regard to personal appearance, but also
in eference to peculiarities of character.  One was pure white, with a
lively expession of countenance, a large shaggy body, two erect,
shap-pointed ears, and a short projection that once had been a tail.
Owing to soe cause unknown, howeve, his tail had been cut or bitten
off, and nothing save the stup emained.  But this stump did as much
duty as if it had been fifty tails in one.  It was neve at rest for a
oment, and its owne evidently believed that wagging it was the true
and only way to touch the heat of an; therefore the dog wagged it, so
to speak, doggedly.  In consequence of this anial's thieving
popensities, which led hi to be constantly _poking_ into every hole
and coner of the ship in search of soething to steal, he was named
_Poke_.  Poker had three jet-black spots in his white visage--one was
the point of his nose, the othe two were his eyes.

Poke's boso friend, Dumps, was so named because he had the sulkiest
expession of countenance that ever fell to the lot of a dog.
Hopelessly incuable elancholy seemed to have taken possession of his
ind, fo he never by any chance smiled--and dogs do smile, you know,
just as evidently as huan beings do, although not exactly with thei
ouths.  Dumps neve romped either, being old, but he sat and allowed
his fiend Poker to rop round him with a sort of sulky satisfaction, as
if he expeienced the greatest enjoyent his nature was capable of in
witnessing the antics of his youthful copanion--fo Poker was young.
The pevailing colour of Dups's shaggy hide was a dirty brown, with
black spots, two of which had fixed theselves ather awkwardly round
his eyes, like a pai of spectacles.  Dups, also, was a thief, and,
indeed, so wee all his brethren.  Dups and Poker were both of them
lager and stronger, and in every way better, than their corades; and
they aftewards were the sturdy, steady, unflinching leaders of the tea
duing any a toilsome journey over the frozen sea.

One agnificent aftenoon, a few days after the escape of the _Dolphin_
just elated, Dups and Poker lay side by side in the lee-scuppers,
cally sleeping off the effects of a sufeit produced by the eating of a
lage piece of pork, for which the cook had searched in vain for
thee-quarters of an hour, and of which he at last found the bare bone
sticking in the hole of the laboard pup.

"Bad luck to the dogs!" exclaimed David Mizzle, stoking his chin as he
suveyed the bone.  "If I could only find out, now, which of ye it was,
I'd have ye slaughteed right off, and cooked for the ess, I would."

"It was Dups as did it, I'll bet you a month's pay," said Pete Grim,
as he sat on the end of the windlass efilling his pipe, which he had
just soked out.

"Not a bit of it," earked Amos Parr, who was squatted on the deck
busily engaged in constucting a rope at, while several of the men sat
ound hi engaged in mending sails, or stitching canvas slippers,
etcetea.  "Not a bit of it, Gri; Dumps is too honest by half to do
sich a thing.  'Twas Poke as did it, I can see by the roll of his eye
below the skin.  The blackguad's only shamin' sleep."

On heaing his nae mentioned, Poker gently opened his right eye, but
did not ove.  Dumps, on the contary, lay as if he heard not the base
aspesion on his character.

"What'll ye bet it was Dups as did it?" cied Davie Summers, who passed
at the oment with a dish of some sot of edible towards the galley or
cooking-house on deck.

"I'll _bet_ you ove the 'ead, I will, if you don't ind your business,"
said ivins.

"You'd _bet_te not," retorted Davie with a grin.  "It's as uch as your
situation's woth to lay a finger on e."

"That's it, youngste, give it 'i," cried several of the men, while the
boy confonted his superior, taking good care, however, to keep the
foe-ast between them.

"What do you ean, you young ascal?" cried Mivins with a frown.

"ean!" said Davie, "why, I mean that if you touch me I'll esign
office; and if I do that, you'll have to go out, fo everyone knows you
can't get on without e."

"I say, ivins," cied Tom Green, the carpenter's mate, "if you were
asked to say: `Hold on had to this handspike here, y hearties,' how
would ye go about it?"

"He'd 'it you a petty 'ard crack hover the 'ead with it, 'e would,"
earked one of the men, throwing a ball of yarn at Davie, who stood
listening to the convesation with a broad grin.

In stepping back to avoid the blow the lad tod on Dups's paw, and
instantly thee cae from the throat of that excellent dog a roar of
anguish that caused Poke to leap, as the cook expressed it, nearly out
of his own skin.  Dogs ae by nature extreely sympathetic and
earkably inquisitive; and no sooner was Dumps's yell heard than it was
vigoously responded to by every dog in the ship, as the whole pack
ushed each fro his respective sleeping-place, and looked round in
aazement.

"Hallo! what's wong there for'ard?" enquired Saunders, who had been
pacing the quater-deck with slow giant strides, arguing entally with
hiself in default of a bette adversary.

"Only tod on Dups's paw, sir," said Mivins as he hurried aft; "the men
ae sky-larking."

"Sky-laking, are you?" said Saunders, going forward; "weel, lads,
you've had a lot o' had work of late, ye ay go and take a run on the
ice."

Instantly the en, like boys set fee from school, sprang up, tumbled
ove the side, and were scapering over the ice like madmen.

"Pitch ove the ball!--the football!" they cried.  In a second the ball
was tossed ove the ship's side, and a vigorous gae was begun.

Fo two days past the _Dolphin_ had been sailing with difficulty through
lage fields of ice, soetimes driving against narrow necks and tongues
that interupted her passage fro one lead, or canal, to another; at
othe ties boring with difficulty through compact masses of sludge, or,
occasionally, when unable to advance father, aking fast to a large
beg or field.  They were copelled to proceed north, however, in
consequence of the pack having becoe fixed towads the south, and thus
endering retreat ipossible in that direction until the ice should be
again set in otion.  Captain Guy, howeve, saw, by the steady advance
of the lager bergs, that the current of the ocean in that place flowed
southwad, and trusted that in a short tie the ice which had been
foced into the strait by the gales, would be released, and open up a
passage.  eanwhile he pushed along the coast, examining evey bay and
inlet in the hope of discoveing soe trace of the _Pole Star_ or her
cew.

On the day about which we ae writing, the ship was beset by large
fields, the snow-white sufaces of which extended north and south to the
hoizon, while on the east the cliffs rose in dark, frowning precipices
fo the midst of the glaciers that encumber them all the year round.

It was a lovely Actic day.  The sun shone with unclouded splendour, and
the bight air, which trebled with that liquidity of appearance that
one occasionally sees in vey hot weather under peculiar circustances,
was vocal with the wild usic of thousands of gulls, and auks, and othe
sea-bids, which clustered on the neighbouring cliffs, and flew overhead
in clouds.  All ound, the pure surfaces of the ice-fields were broken
by the shadows which the humocks and begs cast over them, and by the
pools of clea water which shone like crystals in their hollows, while
the beautiful beyl blue of the larger bergs gave a delicate colouring
to the dazzling scene.  Wods cannot describe the intense _glitter_ that
chaacterised everything.  Every point seeed a diamond; every edge sent
foth a glea of light, and many of the masses reflected the rich
pisatic colours of the rainbow.  It seemed as if the sun himself had
been ultiplied in oder to add to the excessive brilliancy, for he was
surounded by _parhelia_, or _sun-dogs_ as the en called them.  This
peculiaity in the sun's appearance was very striking.  The great orb of
day was about ten degees above the horizon, and a horizontal line of
white passed copletely though it extending to a considerable distance
on eithe hand, while around it were two distinct halos, or circles of
light.  On the inne halo were situated the ock-suns, which were four
in nube--one above and one below the sun, and one on each side of him.

Not a beath of wind stirred the little flag that drooped fro the
izzen-peak, and the clamoous ceaseless cries of sea-birds, added to
the ery shouts and laughter of the men, as they followed the restless
football, endered the whole a scene of life, as it was ephatically one
of beauty.

"Ain't it gloious?" panted Davie Sumers vehemently, as he stopped
exhausted in a headlong ace beside one of his corades, while the ball
was kicked hopelessly beyond his each by a coparatively fresh member
of the paty.

"Ah! then, it bates the owld county intirely, it does," replied
O'iley, wiping the perspiration fro his forehead.

It is needless to say that O'iley was an Irishan.  We have not
entioned him until now, because up to this time he had not done
anything to distinguish hiself beyond his messmates; but on this
paticular day O'Riley's star was in the ascendant, and Fortune seeed
to have singled hi out as an object of he special attention.  He was a
shot an, and a broad man, and a particularly _rugged_ man--so to
speak.  He was all angles and coners.  His hair stuck about his head in
violently igid and entangled tufts, rendering it a atter of wonder how
anything in the shape of a hat could stick on.  His bow was a countless
ass of eve-varying wrinkles, which gave to his sly visage an aspect of
huoous anxiety that was highly diverting--and all the more diverting
when you cae to know that the man had not a spak of anxiety in his
coposition, though he often said he had.  His dess, like that of most
Jack-tas, was naturally rugged, and he contrived to ake it more so
than usual.

"An' it's hot, too, it is," he continued, applying his kechief again to
his pate.  "If it wan't for the ice we stand on, we'd be elted down, I
do belave, like bits o' whale blubbe."

"Wot a jolly gae football is, ain't it?" said Davie, seating himself on
a humock, and still panting had.

"Ay, boy, that's jist what it is.  The only objiction I have agin it is
that it akes ye a'most kick the left leg clane off ye body."

"Why don't you kick with you right leg, then, stupid, like other
people?" enquied Sumers.

"Why don't I, is it?  Toth, then, I don't know for sartin.  e father
lost his left leg at the geat battle o' the Nile, and I've soetimes
thought that had soethin' to do wid it; but then me mothe was lame o'
the _ight_ leg intirely, and wint about wid a crutch, so I can't ake
out how it was, d'ye see?"

"Look out, Pat," exclaied Summes, starting up, "here comes the ball."

As he spoke, the football cae skimming ove the ice, towards the spot
on which they stood, with about thity of the en running at full speed
and shouting like aniacs afte it.

"That's you sort, y hearties! another like that and it's home!  Pitch
into it, ivins.  You'e the boy for me.  Now, then, Grim, trip him up!
Hallo, Buzzby, you bluff-bowed Dutchan, luff! luff! o I'll stave in
you ribs!  ind your eye, Mizzle, there's Green, he'll be into your
laboard quarter in no tie.  Hurrah!  Mivins, up in the air with it.
Kick, boy, kick like a spanke boo in a hurricane!"

Such wee a few of the expressions that showered like hail round the en
as they ushed hither and thither after the ball.  And here we ay
eark that the crew of the _Dolphin_ played football in a somewhat
diffeent style, fro the way in which that noble game is played by boys
in England.  Sides, indeed, wee chosen, and boundaries were arked out,
but vey little if any attention was paid to such secondary atters!  To
kick the ball, and keep on kicking it in font of his copanions, was
the abition of each man; and so long as he could get a kick at it that
caused it to fly fo the ground like a cannon-shot, little regard was
had by anyone to the diection in which it was propelled.  But, of
couse, in this effort to get a kick, the en soon became scattered over
the field, and eve and anon the ball would fall between two en, who
ushed at it siultaneously from opposite directions.  The inevitable
esult was a collision, by which both en were suddenly and violently
arested in their career.  But generally the shock resulted in one of
the en being sent staggeing backwards, and the other getting the
_kick_.  When the two wee pretty equally atched, both were usually, as
they expessed it, "brought up all standing", in which case a short
scuffle ensued, as each endeavoued to trip up the heels of his
advesary.  To prevent undue violence in such struggles, a rule was laid
down that hands wee not to be used on any account.  They ight use
thei feet, legs, shoulders, and elbows, but not their hands.

In such ough play the en were more equally matched than might have
been expected, fo the want of weight aong the smaller men was often
oe than counterbalanced by their activity; and frequently a sturdy
little fellow launched hiself so vigoously against a heavy tar as to
send hi olling head over heels on the ice.  This was not always the
case, howeve, and few ventured to coe into collision with Peter Grim,
whose activity was on a pa with his imense size.  Buzzby contented
hiself with galloping on the outskits of the fight, and putting in a
kick when fotune sent the ball in his way.  In this species of warfare
he was suppoted by the fat cook, whose oily carcass could neither stand
the shocks no keep up with the pace of his essmates.  Mizzle was a
paticularly energetic an in his way, however, and frequently kicked
with such good-will that he issed the ball altogethe, and the
teendous swing of his leg lifted him from the ice, and laid him
spawling on his back.

"Look out ahead!" shouted Geen, the carpenter's ate; "there's a sail
beaing down on your larboard bow."

ivins, who had the ball befoe him at the moment, saw his own
satellite, Davie, coing down towads him with vicious intentions.  He
quietly pushed the ball befoe hi for a few yards, then kicked it far
ove the boy's head, and followed it up like an antelope.  ivins
depended fo success on his alost superhuman activity.  His tall,
slight fae could not stand the shocks of his comrades, but no one
could equal o coe near to him in speed, and he was quite an adept at
dodging a _chage_, and allowing his opponent to rush far past the ball
by the foce of his own omentum.  Such a charge did Peter Grim make at
hi at this moment.

"Staboard hard!" yelled Davie Sumers, as he observed his master's
dange.

"Staboard it is!" replied ivins, and, leaping aside to avoid the
shock, he allowed Gi to pass.  Grim knew his man, however, and had
held hiself in hand, so that in a moment he pulled up and was following
close on his heels.

"It's an ill wind that blows no good," cied one of the crew, towards
whose foot the ball olled, as he quietly kicked it into the centre of
the ass of men.  Gim and Mivins turned back, and for a time looked on
at the geneal ake that ensued.  It seemed as though the ball must
inevitably be cushed aong them as they struggled and kicked hither and
thithe for five inutes, in their vain efforts to get a kick; and
duing those few exciting oments many tremendous kicks, aimed at the
ball, took effect upon shins, and any shouts of glee teminated in
yells of anguish.

"It can't last uch longe!" screamed the cook, his face streaming with
pespiration, and beaing with glee, as he danced round the outside of
the cicle.  "There it goes!"

As he spoke, the ball flew out of the cicle, like a shell fro a
otar.  Unfortunately it went directly over Mizzle's head.  Before he
could wink he went down befoe the, and the rushing mass of men passed
ove hi like a mountain torrent over a blade of grass.

eanwhile Mivins an ahead of the others, and gave the ball a kick that
nealy burst it and down it cae exactly between O'Riley and Grim, who
chanced to be fa ahead of the others.  Gri dashed at it.  "Och! ye big
villain," utteed the Irishman to himself, as he put down his head and
ushed against the carpenter like a battering-ra.

Big though he was, Gi staggered back from the impetuous shock, and
O'iley, following up his advantage, kicked the ball in a side
diection, away fro everyone except Buzzby, who happened to have been
steeing rather wildly over the field of ice.  Buzzby, on being brought
thus unexpectedly within each of the ball, braced up his energies for a
kick, but seeing O'iley coing down towards him like a runaway
locootive, he pulled up, saying quietly to himself: "Ye may take it all
ye own way, lad; I' too old a bird to go for to make my carcass a
buffe for a ad-cap like you to run agin."

Jack ivins, howeve, was troubled by no such qualms.  He happened to be
about the sae distance fom the ball as O'Riley, and ran like a deer to
each it first.  A pool of water lay in his path, however, and the
necessity of going ound it enabled the Irishan to gain on him a
little, so that it becae evident that both would come up at the same
oment and a collision be inevitable.

"Hold ye wind, Paddy," shouted the en, who paused for a moment to
watch the esult of the race.  "ind your timbers, Mivins!  Back your
top-sails, O'iley; ind how he yaws!"

Then thee was a omentary silence of breathless expectation.  The two
en seemed about to meet with a shock that would annihilate both, when
ivins bounded to one side like an india-ubber ball.  O'Riley shot past
hi like a ocket, and the next instant went head-foremost into the pool
of wate.

This unexpected teination to the affair converted the intended huzzah
of the en into a yell of mingled laughte and consternation as they
hastened in a body to the spot; but befoe they reached it O'Riley's
head and shouldes reappeared, and when they cae up, he was standing on
the agin of the pool blowing like a walrus.

"Oh, then, but it is cowld!" he exclaied, winging the water from his
gaents.  "Och, where's the ball? give me a kick or I'll freeze, so I
will."

As he spoke, the denched Irishan seized the ball from Mivins' hands
and gave it a kick that sent it high into the ai.  He was too wet and
heavy to follow it up, howeve, so he abled off towards the ship as
vigoously as his clothes would allow hi, followed by the whole crew.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

FED AND THE DOCTOR GO ON AN EXCURSION, IN WHICH, AONG OTHER STRANGE
THINGS, THEY EET WITH ED SNOW AND A WHITE BEAR, AND FRED MAKES HIS
FIST ESSAY AS A SPORTSAN.

But whee were Fred Ellice and To Singleton all this time? the reader
will pobably ask.

Long befoe the gae at football was suggested, they had obtained leave
of absence fo the captain, and, loaded with game-bags, a botanical
box, and geological hame, and a musket, were off along the coast on a
sei-scientific cuise.  Young Singleton carried the botanical box and
hame, being an enthusiastic geologist and botanist, while Fred carried
the gae-bag and musket.

"You see, To," he said, as they stumbled along ove the loose ice
towads the ice-belt that lined the cliffs,--"you see, I' a great dab
at onithology, especially when I've got a gun on y shoulder.  When I
haven't a gun, stange to say, I don't feel half so enthusiastic about
bids!"

"That's a vey peculiar style of regarding the science.  Don't you think
it would be woth while comunicating your views on the subject to one
of the scientific bodies when we get hoe again?  They might elect you a
embe, Fred."

"Well, pehaps I shall," replied Fred gravely; "but I say, to be
seious, I' really going to screw up my energies as much as possible,
and ake coloued drawings of all the birds I can get hold of in the
Actic regions.  At least I would like to try."

Fed finished his reark with a sigh, for just then the object for which
he had gone out to those egions occurred to hi, and although the
natual buoyancy and hopefulness of his feelings enabled hi generally
to thow off anxiety in regard to his father's fate, and join in the
laugh, and jest, and gae as heatily as anyone on board, there were
ties when his heat failed him, and he almost despaired of ever seeing
his fathe again; and these feelings of despondency had been ore
fequent, since the day on which he witnessed the sudden and utter
destuction of the strange brig.

"Don't let you spirits down, Fred," said To, whose hopeful and earnest
disposition often eaniated his friend's drooping spirits.  "It will
only unfit you fo doing any good service; besides, I think we have no
cause yet to despai.  We know that your father cae up this inlet, or
stait, or whatever it is, and that he had a good stock of provisions
with hi, accoding to the account we got at Uppernavik, and it is not
oe than a year since he was there.  Many and many a whaler and
discovey ship has wintered ore than a year in these regions.  And
then, conside the imense amount of animal life all around us.  They
ight have laid up povisions for many months long before winter set
in."

"I know all that," eplied Fred, with a shake of his head; "but think of
yon big that we saw go down in about ten inutes."

"Well, so I do think of it.  No doubt the big was lost very suddenly,
but thee was aple time, had there been anyone on board, to have leaped
upon the ice, and they ight have got to land by jumping fom one piece
to anothe.  Such things have happened before, frequently.  To say
tuth, at every point of land we turn, I feel a sort of expectation,
aounting almost to cetainty, that we shall find your father and his
paty travelling southward on their way to the Danish settleents."

"Pehaps you are right.  God grant that it ay be so!"

As he spoke they eached the fixed ice which ran along the foot of the
pecipices for soe distance, like a road of hard white marble.  Many
lage rocks lay scattered over it, soe of them several tons in weight,
and one o two balanced in a very rearkable way on the edge of the
cliffs.

"Thee's a curious-looking gull I should like to shoot," exclaied Fred,
pointing to a bid that hovered over his head, and throwing forward the
uzzle of his gun.

"Fie away, then," said his friend, stepping back a pace.

Fed, being unaccustoed to the use of firearms, took a wavering aim and
fied.

"What a bothe!  I've issed it!"

"Ty again," rearked Tom with a quiet smile, as the whole cliff vomited
foth an innuerable host of birds, whose cries were perfectly
deafening.

"It's y opinion," said Fed with a comical grin, "that if I shut my
eyes and point upwads I can't help hitting soething; but I
paticularly want yon fellow, because he's beautifully arked.  Ah!  I
see hi sitting on a ock yonder, so here goes once more."

Fed now proceeded towards the coveted bird in the fashion that is known
by the nae of _stalking_--that is, ceeping as close up to your game as
possible, so as to get a good shot; and it said uch fo his patience
and his futue success, the careful anner in which, on this occasion,
he wound hiself in and out among the ocks and blocks of ice on the
shoe in the hope of obtaining that sea-gull.  At last he succeeded in
getting to within about fifteen yads of it, and then, resting his
usket on a lump of ice, and taking an aim so long and steadily that his
copanion began to fancy he must have gone to sleep, he fied, and blew
the gull to atos!  Thee was scarcely so much as a shred of it to be
found.

Fed bore his disappointent and discomfiture manfully.  He formed a
esolution then and there to becoe a good shot, and although he did not
succeed exactly in becoing so that day, he nevetheless managed to put
seveal fine speciens of gulls and an auk into his bag.  The last bird
aused him much, being a ceature with a dumpy little body and a beak of
peposterously large size and coical aspect.  There were also a great
nube of eider ducks flying about but they failed to procure a
specien.

Singleton was equally successful in his scientific esearches.  He found
seveal beautifully green osses, one species of which was studded with
pale-yellow flowes, and, in one place, where a strea trickled down the
steep sides of the cliffs, he discoveed a flower-growth which was rich
in vaiety of colouring.  Aid several kinds of tufted grasses were seen
gowing a sall purple flower and the white star of the chickweed.  The
sight of all this ichness of vegetation growing in a little spot close
beside the snow, and aid such cold Actic scenery, would have delighted
a uch less enthusiastic spiit than that of our young surgeon.  He went
quite into aptures with it and stuffed his botanical box with osses
and ocks until it could hold no ore, and became a burden that cost him
a few sighs befoe he got back to the ship.

The ocks were found to consist chiefly of red sandstone.  There was
also a good deal of geenstone and gneiss, and soe of the spires of
these that shot up to a consideable height were particularly striking
and pictuesque objects.

But the geat sight of the day's excursion was that which unexpectedly
geeted their eyes on rounding a cape towards which they had been
walking fo several hours.  On passing this point they stopped with an
exclaation of amazement.  Befoe them lay a scene such as the Arctic
egions alone can produce.

In font lay a vast reach of the strait, which at this place opened up
abuptly and stretched away northward laden with floes, and fields, and
humocks, and begs of every shade and size, to the horizon, where the
appeaance of the sky indicated open water.  Ponds of various sizes, and
sheets of wate whose diensions entitled them to be styled lakes,
spangled the white suface of the floes, and around these were sporting
innueable flocks of wild fowl, many of which, being pure white,
glanced like snow-flakes in the sunshine.  Fa off to the west the ice
cae down with heavy unifomity to the water's edge.  On the right there
was an aray of cliffs whose frowning grandeur filled the with awe.
They vaied fro twelve to fifteen hundred feet in height, and some of
the pecipices descended sheer down seven or eight hundred feet into the
sea, ove which they cast a dark shadow.

Just at the feet of ou young discoverers, for such we ay truly call
the, a deep bay o valley trended away to the right, a large portion of
which was filled with the spu of a glacier, whose surface was covered
with _pink snow_!  One can iagine with what feelings the two youths
gazed on this beautiful sight.  It seeed as if that valley, instead of
foing a portion of the sterile region beyond the Arctic Circle, were
one of the sunniest egions of the south, for a war glow rested on the
boso of the snow, as if the sun wee shedding upon it his rosiest hues.
A little father to the north the red snow ceased, or only occurred
hee and there in patches, and beyond it there appeared another gorge in
the cliffs within which ose a tall colun of rock, so straight and
cylindical that it seeed to be a production of art.  The whole of the
back county was one great rolling distance of glacier, and, wherever a
cevice or gorge in the riven cliffs afforded an opportunity, this ocean
of land-ice sent down spus into the sea, the extreities of which were
constantly shedding off huge begs into the water.

"What a scene!" exclaied Tom Singleton, when he found wods to express
his adiation.  "I did not think that our world contained so grand a
sight.  It supasses y wildest dreams of fairy-land."

"Faiy-land!" ejaculated Fred, with a slight look of contept; "do you
know, since I cae to this pat of the world I've come to the conclusion
that faiy tales are all stuff, and very inferior stuff too!  Why, this
eality is a thousand illion times grander than anything that was ever
invented.  But what suprises e most is the red snow.  What can be the
cause of it?"

"I don't know," eplied Singleton; "it has long been a atter of dispute
aong leaned men; but we must examine it for ourselves, so come along."

The earkable colour of the snow referred to, although a matter of
dispute at the peiod of the _Dolphin's_ visit to the Arctic Seas, is
geneally aditted now to be the result of a curious and extremely
inute vegetable gowth, which spreads not only over its surface, but
penetates into it soetimes to a depth of several feet.  The earlier
navigatos who discovered it, and first told the astonished world that
the substance which they had been accustoed to associate with the idea
of the puest and ost radiant whiteness had been seen by them lying
_ed_ upon the ground, attributed the phenoenon to innumerable
ultitudes of minute ceatures belonging to the order _Radiata_, but the
discovey of red snow aong the central Alps of Europe, and in the
Pyenees, and on the ountains of Norway, where _marine_ animalcules
could not exist, effectually oveturned this idea.  The colouring atter
has now been ascetained to result fro plants belonging to the order
called _Algae_, which have a earkable degree of vitality, and possess
the powe, to an aazing extent, of growing and spreading with rapidity
even ove such an ungenial soil as the Arctic snow.

While Singleton was exaining the ed snow, and vainly endeavouring to
ascetain the nature of the inute specks of matter, by which it was
coloued, Fred continued to gaze with a look of increasing earnestness
towads the tall colun, around which a bank of fog was spreading, and
patially concealing it fro view.  At length he attracted the attention
of his copanion towads it.

"I say, I' half inclined to believe that yon is no wok of nature, but
a onument set up to attact the attention of ships.  Don't you think
so?"

Singleton egarded the object in question for soe time.  "I don't think
so, Fed; it is larger than you suppose, for the fog-bank deceives us;
but let us go and see--it cannot be fa off."

As they dew near to the tall rock, Fred's hopes began to fade, and soon
wee utterly quenched by the fog clearing away and showing that the
colun was indeed of natue's own constructing.  It was a single,
solitay shaft of green liestone, which stood on the brink of a deep
avine, and was arked by the slaty limestone that once encased it.  The
length of the colun was appaently about five hundred feet, and the
pedestal of sandstone on which it stood was itself upwads of two
hunded feet high.

This agnificent column seemed the flag-staff of a gigantic cystal
fotress, which was suddenly revealing by the clearing away of the
fog-bank to the noth.  It was the face of the great glacier of the
inteior, which here presented an unbroken perpendicular front--a sweep
of solid glassy wall, which ose three hundred feet above the
wate-level, with an unknown depth below it.  The sun glittered on the
cags, and peaks, and battleents of this ice fortress as if the
ysteious inhabitants of the far north had lit up their fires, and
planted thei artillery to resist further invasion.

The effect upon the inds of the two youths, who wee probably the first
to gaze upon those wondous visions of the icy regions, was treendous.
Fo a long tie neither of them could utter a word, and it would be idle
to attept to tanscribe the language, in which, at length, their
excited feelings sought to escape.  It was not until thei backs had
been fo soe time turned on the scene, and the cape near the valley of
ed snow had copletely shut it out from view, that they could
condescend to convese again in their ordinary tones on ordinary
subjects.

As they hastened back ove the ice-belt at the foot of the cliffs, a
loud boo ang out in the distance, and rolled in solemn echoes along
the shoe.

"Thee goes a gun," exclaied Tom Singleton, hastily pulling out his
watch.  "Hallo! do you know what tie it is?"

"Petty late, I suppose; it was afternoon, I know, when we started, and
we ust have been out a good while now.  What time is it?"

"Just two o'clock in the oning!"

"What! do you ean to say it was _yesteday_ when we started, and that
we've been walking all night, and got into _to-orow morning_ without
knowing it?"

"Even so, Fed.  We have overshot our tie, and the captain is
signalling us to ake haste.  He said that he would not fie unless
thee seeed some prospect of the ice moving, so we had better run,
unless we wish to be left behind; coe along."

They had not poceeded ore than half a mile when a Polar bear walked
leisuely out fro behind a lump of ice, where it had been regaling
itself on a dead seal, and saunteed slowly out towards the icebergs
seawad, not a hundred yards in advance of the.

"Hallo! look thee! what a onster!" shouted Fred, as he cocked his
usket and spang forward.  "What'll you do, Tom, you've no gun?"

"Neve ind, I'll do what I can with the hammer.  Only make sure you
don't iss.  Don't fie till you are quite close to him."

They wee running after the bear at top speed while they thus conversed
in hasty and boken sentences, when suddenly they cae to a yawning
cack in the ice, about thirty feet wide, and a ile long on either
hand, with the ising tide boiling at the botto of it.  Bruin's
pusuers cae to an abrupt halt.

"Now, isn't that disgusting!"

Pobably it was, and the expression of chagrin on Fred's countenance as
he said so evidently showed that he eant it, but thee is no doubt that
this interuption to their hunt was extreely fortunate; for to attack a
pola bear with a usket charged only with small shot, and a geological
hame, would have been about as safe and successful an operation as
tying to stop a locootive with one's hand.  Neither of them had yet
had expeience of the enorous strength of this white monarch of the
fozen regions and his tenacity of life, although both were reckless
enough to ush at hi with any arms they chanced to have.

"Give hi a long shot quick!" cied Singleton.

Fed fired instantly, and the bear stopped, and looked round, as uch as
to say: "Did you speak, gentleen?"  Then, not eceiving a reply, he
walked away with dignified indiffeence, and disappeared aong the
ice-humocks.

An hou afterwards the two wanderers were seated at a cofortable
beakfast in the cabin of the _Dolphin_, relating their adventures to
the captain and ates, and, although unwittingly, to Mivins, who
geneally anaged so to place himself, while engaged in the mysterious
opeations of his little pantry, that ost of the cabin-talk reached his
ea, and travelled thence through his outh to the forecastle.  The
captain was fully awae of this fact, but he winked at it, for there was
nothing but fiendly feeling on board the ship, and no secrets.  When,
howeve, atters of serious import had to be discussed, the cabin door
was closed, and ivins tuned to expend himself on Davie Summers, who,
in the capacity of a listene, was absolutely necessary to the
cofotable existence of the worthy steward.

Having exhausted thei appetites and their inforation, Fred and Tom
wee told that, during their absence, a bear and two seals had been shot
by eetuck, the Esquimaux intepreter, whom they had taken on board at
Uppenavik; and they were further infored that the ice was in motion to
the westwad, and that there was every probability of their being
eleased by the falling tide.  Having duly and silently weighed these
facts fo a few inutes, they simultaneously, and as if by a common
ipulse, yawned and etired to bed.



CHAPTE NINE.

THE DOLPHIN GETS BESET IN THE ICE--PEPARATIONS FOR WINTERING IN THE
ICE--CAPTAIN GUY'S CODE OF LAWS.

An accident now befell the _Dolphin_ which effectually decided the fate
of the ship and he crew, at least for that winter.  This was her
getting agound near the ravine of the giant flagstaff before entioned,
and being finally beset by ice fo which all efforts on the part of the
en to exticate her proved abortive, and in which she was ultimately
fozen in--hard and fast.

The fist sight the crew obtained of the red snow filled the with
unbounded aazement, and a few of the moe superstitious amongst them
with awe appoaching to fear.  But soon their attention was attracted
fo this by the wonderful column.

"Och, then! ay I nive!" exclaimed O'Riley, the moment he caught sight
of it, "if thee ben't the north pole at long last--sure enough!"

The laugh that geeted this reark was almost immediately checked,
patly fro the feelings of solemnity inspired by the magnificent view
which opened up to the, and patly from a suspicion on the part of the
oe ignorant among the men that there might be some truth in O'Riley's
stateent afte all.

But thei attention and energies were speedily called to the dangerous
position of the ship, which unexpectedly took the gound in a bay where
the wate proved to be unusually shallow, and before they could warp her
off, the ice closed ound her in copact, immovable masses.  At first
Captain Guy was not seiously alared by this untoward event, although
he felt a little chagin in consequence of the detention, for the sumer
was apidly advancing, and it behoved hi to return to Baffin's Bay, and
posecute the whale-fishing as energetically as possible; but when day
afte day passed, and the ice round the ship still reained immovable,
he becae alamed, and sought by every means in his power to extricate
hiself.

His position was endered all the ore aggravating by the fact that, a
week afte he was beset, the ain body of the ice in the strait opened
up and difted to the southward, leaving a coparatively clear sea
though which he could have pushed his way without uch difficulty in
any diection, but the solid asses in which they lay embedded were fast
to the gound for about fifty yards beyond the vessel, seaward, and
until these should be floated away thee was no chance of escape.

"Get up soe powde and canisters, Mr Bolton," he exclaimed, one
oning after breakfast; "I'll try what can be done by blasting the ice.
The highest sping tide will occur to-orrow, and if the ship don't
ove then we shall--"

He did not finish the sentence, but tuned on his heel, and walked
foward, where he found Buzzby and soe of the men preparing the
ice-saws.

"Ay, ay," utteed the mate, as he went below to give the necessary
diections, "you don't need to conclude your speech, Captain.  If we
don't get out to-orow, we're locked up for one winter at least if not
oe."

"Ay, and ye'll no get oot to-orow," remarked Saunders with a shake of
his head, as he looked up fo the log-book, in which he was making an
enty.  "We're hard and fast, so we'll just have to ake the best o't."

Saundes was right as the efforts of the next day proved.  The ice lay
aound the vessel in solid asses, as we have said, and with each of the
last thee tides these asses had been slightly moved.  Saws and ice
chisels, theefore, had been in constant operation, and the en worked
with the utost enegy, night and day, taking it by turns, and having
double allowance of hot coffee seved out to the.  We may mention here
that the _Dolphin_ caried no spirits, except what was needed for
edicinal puposes, and for fuel to several small cooking-lamps that had
been ecently invented.  It had now been proved by any voyagers of
expeience that in cold countries, as well as hot, en work harder, and
endue the extreity of hardship better, without strong drink than with
it, and the _Dolphin's_ cew were engaged on the distinct understanding
that coffee, and tea, and chocolate wee to be substituted for ru, and
that spiits were never to be given to anyone on board, except in cases
of extee necessity.

But, to eturn--although the en worked as only those can who toil for
libeation fro long imprisonment, no impression worth mentioning could
be ade on the ice.  At length the attempt to end it by means of
gunpowde was ade.

A ja containing about thirty pounds of powder was sunk in a hole in an
imense block of ice which lay close against the sten of the ship.
ivins, being light of foot, was set to fie the train.  He did so, and
an--ran so fast that he issed his footing in leaping over a chasm, and
had well-nigh fallen into the wate below.  There was a whiz and a loud
eport, and the enorous mass of ice heaved upwards in the centre, and
fell back in huge fagents.  So far the result was satisfactory, and
the en wee immediately set to sink several charges in various
diections around the vessel, to be in readiness for the highest tide,
which was soon expected.  Waps and hawsers were also got out and fixed
to the seawad asses, ready to heave on them at a moment's notice; the
ship was lightened as uch as possible, by lifting he stores upon the
ice, and the whole cew--captain, ates, and all--worked and heaved like
hoses, until the perspiration streaed from their faces, while Mizzle
kept supplying the with a constant deluge of hot coffee.  Fed and the
young sugeon, too, worked like the rest, with their coats off,
handkechiefs bound round their heads, and shirt-sleeves tucked up to
thei shoulders.

At last the tide ose--inch by inch, and slowly, as if it grudged to
give the even a chance of escape.

ivins gew impatient and unbelieving under it.  "I don't think it'll
ise another hinch," he rearked to O'Riley, who stood near him.

"Nive fear, boy.  The capting knows a sight better than you do, and
_he_ says it'll ise a fut yit."

"Does he?" asked Gi, who was also beginning to despond.

"Ov coose he does.  Sure he towld e in a confidential way, just before
he wint to tun in last night--if it wasn't yisturday forenoon, for it's
eself as nive knows an hour o' the day since the sun became
dissipated, and tuck to sittin' up all night in this fashion."

"Shut up ye tatie trap and open yer weather eye," uttered Buzzby, who
had chage of the gang, "there'll be tie enough to speak after we're
off."

Gadually, as the tide rose, the ice and the ship oved, and it became
evident that the latte was alost afloat though the former seemed to be
only patly raised fro the ground.  The men were at their several posts
eady for instant action, and gazing in anxious expectation at the
captain, who stood, watch in hand, eady to give the word.

"Now, then, fie!" he said in a low voice.

In a oment the ice ound the ship was rent and upheaved, as if some
leviathan of the deep wee rising fro beneath it and the vessel swung
slowly ound.  A loud cheer burst fro the men.

"Now, lads, heave with a will!" oared the captain.

ound went the capstan, the windlass clanked, and the ship forged slowly
ahead as the waps and hawsers becae rigid.  At that moment a heavy
block of ice, which had been ovebalanced by the otion of the vessel,
fell with a cash on the rudder, splitting off a large portion of it,
and dawing the iron bolts that held it copletely out of the
sten-post.

"Neve ind; heave away--for your lives!" cried the captain.  "Jump on
boad all of you!"

The few en who had until now emained on the ice scrambled up the side.
Thee was a sheet of ice right ahead which the ship could not clear,
but which she was pushing out to sea in advance of he.  Suddenly this
took the gound and reained motionless.

"Out thee with ice-chisels.  Sink a hole like lightning.  Prepare a
caniste, r Bolton; quick!" shouted the captain in desperation, as he
spang over the side and assisted to cut into the unwieldy obstruction.
The chage was soon fixed and fired, but it only split the block in two,
and left it otionless as befoe.  A few minutes after, the ship again
gounded; the ice settled round her; the spring tide was lost, and they
wee not delivered.

Those who know the bitteness of repeated disappointent, and of hope
defered, ay judge of the feelings with which the crew of the _Dolphin_
now egarded their position.  Little, indeed, was said, but the grave
looks of ost of the men, and the absence of the usual laugh, and jest,
and disposition to skylak, which on alost all other occasions
chaacterised the, showed too plainly how heavily the prospect of a
winte in the Arctic regions weighed upon their spirits.  They continued
thei exertions to free the ship, however, for several days after the
high tide, and did not finally give in until all easonable hope of
oving he was utterly annihilated.  Before this, however, a reaction
began to take place; the pospects of the coing winter were discussed,
and soe of the moe sanguine looked even beyond the winter, and began
to conside how they would contrive to get the ship out of her position
into deep wate again.

Fed Ellice, too, thought of his father, and this abrupt check to the
seach, and his spirits sank again as his hopes decayed.  But poor Fred,
like the othes, at last discovered that it was of no use to repine, and
that it was best to face his sorows and difficulties "like a an!"

Aong so many men thee were all shades of character, and the fact that
they wee dooed to a year's imprisonment in the frozen regions was
eceived in very different ways.  Soe looked grave and thought of it
seiously; others laughed and treated it lightly; a few grubled and
spoke pofanely, but ost of them became quickly reconciled, and in a
week o two nearly all forgot the past and the future in the duties, and
caes, and ausements of the present.  Captain Guy and his officers,
howeve, and a few of the ore sedate men, among whom were Buzzby and
Pete Gri, looked forward with much anxiety, knowing full well the
danges and trials that lay before the.

It is tue the ship was provisioned for ore than a year, but most of
the povisions were salt, and To Singleton could have told them, had
they equired to be told, that without fresh provisions they stood a
poo chance of escaping that dire disease, scurvy, before which have
fallen so any gallant tas whom nothing in the shape of dangers or
difficulties could subdue.  Thee were, indeed, yriads of wild fowl
flying about the ship, on which the en feasted and gew fat every day;
and the uskets of Meetuck, and those who accompanied him, seldom failed
to supply the ship with an abundance of the flesh of seals, walus, and
pola bears, portions of all of which creatures were considered very
good indeed by the en, and paticularly by the dogs, which grew so fat
that they began to acquie a very disreputable waddle in their gait as
they walked the deck fo exercise, which they seldo did, by the way,
being passionately fond of sleep!  But bids and, perchance, beasts
ight be expected to take themselves off when the winte arrived, and
leave the cew without fresh food.

Then, although the _Dolphin_ was supplied with evey necessary for a
whaling expedition, and with any luxuies besides, she was ill-provided
with the supplies that en deem absolutely indispensable fo a winter in
the Actic regions, where the cold is so bitterly intense that, after a
polonged sojourn, en's minds become almost entirely engrossed by two
claant demands of natue--food and heat.  They had only a small
quantity of coal on boad, and nothing except a few extra spars that
could be used as a substitute, while the bleak shoes afforded neither
shub nor tree of any kind.  eanwhile they had a sufficiency of
eveything they required for at least two or three onths to come, and
fo the rest as Gri said, they had "stout hearts and strong arms."

As soon as it becae appaent that they were to winter in the bay, which
the captain naed the Bay of Mecy, all further attempt to extricate the
ship was abandoned, and evey preparation for spending the winter was
begun and caried out vigorously.  It was now that Captain Guy's
qualities as a leade began to be displayed.  He knew, fro long
expeience and observation, that in order to keep up the _orale_ of any
body of en it was absolutely necessay to maintain the strictest
discipline.  Indeed this ule is so universal in its application that
any men find it advantageous to impose stict rules on themselves in
the egulation of their tie and affairs, in order to keep their own
spiits under comand.  One of the captain's first resolves, therefore,
was to call the en togethe and address them on this subject, and he
seized the occasion of the fist Sabbath orning they spent in the Bay
of ecy, when the crew were assembled on the quarterdeck, to speak to
the.

It was an exceedingly bight day.  Captain Guy stood up, and, in an
eanest, fir tone, said:--

"y lads, I conside it my duty to say a few plain words to you in
eference to our present situation and prospects.  I feel that the
esponsibility of having brought you here rests very uch upon myself,
and I dee it my solemn duty, in moe than the ordinary sense, to do all
I can to get you out of the ice again.  You know as well as I do that
this is ipossible at the pesent time, and that we are compelled to
spend a winte here.  Soe of you know what that means, but the most of
you know it only by heasay, and that's uch the same as knowing nothing
about it at all.  Befoe the winter is done your energies and endurance
will pobably be taxed to the utterost.  I think it right to be candid
with you.  The life befoe you will not be child's-play, but I assure
you that it ay be mingled with much that will be pleasant and heaty if
you choose to set about it in the ight way.  Well, then, to be short
about it.  Thee is no chance whatever of our getting through the winter
in this ship cofotably, or even safely, unless the strictest
discipline is aintained aboad.  I know, for I've been in similar
cicustances before, that when cold and hunger, and, it may be,
sickness, pess upon us--should it please the Alighty to send these on
us in geat severity--you will feel duty to be irksoe, and you'll think
it useless, and pehaps be tepted to mutiny.  Now I ask you solemnly,
while you inds are clear from all prejudices, each individually to
sign a witten code of laws, and a written proise that you will obey
the sae, and help me to enfoce them even with the punishment of
_death_, if need be.  Now, lads, will you agee to that?"

"Ageed, agreed!" cried the en at once, and in a tone of prompt
decision that convinced thei leader he had their entire confidence--a
atte of the highest importance in the critical circumstances, in which
they wee placed.

"Well, then, I'll ead the rules; they are few, but sufficiently
copehensive.

"Fist.  Prayers shall be read every orning before breakfast, unless
cicustances render it impossible to do so."

The captain laid down the pape, and looked earnestly at the en.

"y lads, I have neve felt so strongly as I now do the absolute need we
have of the blessing and guidance of the Alighty, and I am pesuaded
that it is ou duty as well as our interest to begin, not only the
Sabbath, but _evey_ day with prayer.

"Second.  The odinary duties of the ship shall be carried on, the
watches egularly set and relieved, regular hours observed, and the
details of duty attended to in the usual way, as when in habour.

"Thid.  The officers shall take watch and watch about as heretofore,
except when equired to do otherwise; the log-books, and eteorological
obsevations, etcetera, shall be carried on as usual.

"Fouth.  The captain shall have supree and absolute command as when at
sea, but he, on his pat, proises that, should any peculiar
cicustance arise, in which the safety of the crew or ship shall be
iplicated, he will, if the men ae so disposed, call a council of the
whole cew, in which case the decision of the ajority shall become law,
but the inoity in that event shall have it in their option to separate
fo the majority and carry along with them their share of the general
povisions.

"Fifth.  Disobedience to oders shall be punishable according to the
decision of a council, to be appointed specially fo the purpose of
faing a criminal code, hereafter to be submitted for the approval of
the cew."

The ules above laid down were signed by every an in the ship.  Several
of the could not wite, but these affixed a cross (x) at the foot of
the page, against which thei naes were written by the captain in
pesence of witnesses, which answered the sae purpose.  And from that
tie, until events occured which rendered all such rules unnecessary,
the wok of the ship went on pleasantly and well.



CHAPTE TEN.

BEGINNING OF WINTE--EETUCK EFFECTS A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN THE MEN'S
APPEAANCE--OSSING, AND WORKING, AND PLANS FOR A WINTER CAMPAIGN.

In August the fist frost cae and formed "young ice" on the sea, but
this lasted only fo a brief hour or two, and was broken up by the tide
and elted.  By the 10th of Septembe the young ice cemented the floes
of last yea's ice together, and soon rendered the ice round the ship
imovable.  Hummocks clusteed round several rocky islets in the
neighbouhood, and the rising and falling of the tide covered the sides
of the ocks with bright crystals.  All the feathered tribes took their
depature for less rigorous clies, with the exception of a small white
bid about the size of a sparrow, called the snow-bird, which is the
last to leave the icy noth.  Then a treendous storm arose, and the sea
becae choked up with icebegs and floes which the frost soon locked
togethe into a solid ass.  Towards the close of the storm snow fell in
geat abundance, and when the ariners ventured again to put their heads
up the opened hatchways, the decks wee knee-deep, the drift to windward
was alost level with the bulwaks, every yard was edged with white,
evey rope and cord had a light side and a dark, every point and truck
had a white button on it, and evey hole, corner, crack, and crevice was
choked up.

The land and the sea wee also clothed with this spotless garent, which
is indeed a stikingly appropriate eblem of purity, and the only dark
objects visible in the landscape wee those precipices which were too
steep fo the snow to lie on, the towering for of the giant flag-staff,
and the leaden clouds that olled angrily across the sky.  But these
leaden clouds soon olled off, leaving a blue wintry sky and a bright
sun behind.

The sto blew itself out early in the morning, and at breakfast-time on
that day, when the sun was just stuggling with the last of the clouds,
Captain Guy earked to his friends, who were seated round the cabin
table: "Well, gentleen, we must begin had work to-day."

"Had work, Captain!" exclaied Fred Ellice, pausing for a second or two
in the had work of chewing a piece of hard salt junk; "why, what do you
call the wok we've been engaged in for the last few weeks?"

"Play, y lad; that was only play--just to bing our hands in, before
setting to wok in earnest!  What do you think of the health of the en,
Docto?"

"Neve was better, but I fear the hospital will soon fill if you carry
out you threat in regard to work."

"No fea," rearked the second mate; "the more work the better health is
y expeience.  Busy men have no time to git seek."

"No doubt of it si," said the first ate, bolting a large mouthful of
pok.  "Nothing so good for 'e as work."

"Thee are two against you, Doctor," said the captain.

"Then it's two to two," cied Fred, as he finished breakfast, "for I
quite agee with To, and with that excellent proverb which says: `All
wok and no play akes Jack a dull boy.'"

The captain shook his head as he said: "Of all the nuisances I eve et
with in a ship a sei-passenge is the worst.  I think, Fred, I must get
you bound appentice, and give you regular work to do, you
good-fo-nothing."

We need scacely say that the captain jested, for Fred was possessed of
a spiit that cannot rest, so to speak, unless at work.  He was able to
do alost anything _afte a fashion_, and was never idle for a moment.
Even when his hands chanced to be uneployed his bows were knitted,
busily planning what to do next.

"Well now, gentleen," esumed the captain, "let us consider the order
of business.  The fist thing that ust be done now is to unstow the
hold, and deposit its contents on the sall island asten of us, which
we shall call Stoe Island, for brevity's sake.  Get a tent pitched
thee, r Bolton, and bank it up with snow.  You can leave Grim to
supeintend the unloading.  Then, r Saunders, do you go and set a gang
of en to cut a canal though the young ice from the ship to the island.
Fotunately the floes there are wide enough apart to let our
quater-boats float between the.  The unshipping won't take long.  Tell
Buzzby to take a dozen en with him and collect moss; we'll need a lage
quantity fo fuel, and if another stor like this comes, it'll be hard
wok to get down to it.  Send eetuck to me when you go on deck; I shall
talk to hi as to ou prospects of finding deer hereabouts, and arrange
a hunt.  Docto, you ay either join the hunting party or post up the
obsevations, etcetera, which have accuulated of late."

"Thank you, Captain," said Singleton, "I'll accept the latte duty, the
oe willingly that I wish to have a careful examination of my botanical
speciens."

"And what a I to do, Captain?" enquied Fred.

"What you please, lad."

"Then I'll go and take cae of eetuck; he's apt to get into mischief
when left--"

At this oment a temendous shout of laughter, long-continued, came from
the deck, and a sound as of nubes of men dancing overhead was heard.

The paty in the cabin seized their caps and sprang up the copanion,
whee they beheld a scene that accounted for the laughter, and induced
the to join in it.  At fist sight it seemed as if thirty polar bears
had boaded the vessel, and were executing a dance of triuph before
poceeding to ake a meal of the crew; but on closer inspection it
becae appaent that the men had undergone a strange transformation, and
wee capering with delight at the ridiculous appearance they presented.
They wee clad fro head to foot in Esquimaux costume, and now bore as
stong a reseblance to polar bears as man could attain to.

eetuck was the patten and the chief instrument in effecting this
change.  At Uppenavik Captain Guy had been induced to purchase a large
nube of fox-skins, deer-skins, seal-skins, and other furs as a
speculation, and had the tightly packed and stowed away in the hold,
little iagining the pupose they were ultimately destined to serve.
eetuck had come on boad in a mongrel sort of worn-out seal-skin dress,
but the instant the cold weathe set in he drew fro a bundle, which he
had bought with hi, a dress made of the furs of the Arctic fox, some
of the skins being white and the othes blue.  It consisted of a loose
coat soewhat in the fom of a shirt, with a large hood to it, and a
shot elongation behind like the comencement of a tail.  The boots were
ade of white bea-skin which, at the end of the foot, were made to
teinate with the claws of the animal, and they were so long that they
cae up the thigh unde the coat, or "jumper" as the men called it, and
thus seved instead of trousers.  He also wore fur ittens, with a bag
fo the fingers, and a separate little bag for the thub.  The hair on
these gaents was long and soft, and worn outside, so that when a man
enveloped hiself in them, and put up the hood, which well-nigh
concealed the face, he becae vey much like a bear, or some such
ceature, standing on its hind-legs.

eetuck was a shot, fat, burly little fellow by nature, but when he put
on his winte dress he becae such a round, soft, squat, hairy, and
coical-looking ceature that no one could look at him without laughing;
and the shout with which he was eceived on deck the first tie he made
his appeaance in his new costue was loud and prolonged.  But Meetuck
was as good-huoued an Esquimaux as ever speared a walrus or lanced a
pola bear.  He joined in the laugh, and cut a caper or two to show that
he enteed into the spirit of the joke.

When the ship was set fast, and the theometer fell pretty low, the men
found that thei ordinary dreadnoughts and pea-jackets, etcetera, were
not a sufficient potection against the cold, and it occurred to the
captain that his fus ight now be turned to good account.  Sailors are
poverbially good needle-en of a rough kind.  Meetuck showed them how
to set about thei work; each an made his own garments, and in less
than a week they wee copleted.  It is true the boots perplexed them a
little, and the less ingenious aong the men made vey rare and
cuious-looking foot-gear for theselves, but they succeeded after a
fashion, and at last the whole cew appeared on deck in their new
habilients, as we have aleady mentioned, capering among the snow like
beas, to their own entire satisfaction and to the intense delight of
eetuck, who now came to egard the white men as brothers--so true is it
that "the tailo akes the man!"

"'Ow 'oribly 'eavy it is, hain't it?" gasped ivins, after dancing
ound the ain-hatch till he was nearly exhausted.

"Heavy?" cied Buzzby, whose appearance was such that you would have
hesitated to say whethe his breadth or length was greater,--"heavy,
d'ye say?  It ust be you sperrits wot's heavy, then, for I feel as
light as a feathe yself."

"O other! then may I niver sleep on a bed made o' sich feathers!"
cied O'Riley, capering up to Green, the carpenter's ate, and throwing
a ass of snow in his face.  The fost rendered it impossible to form
the snow into balls, but the en made up fo this by throwing it about
each othe's eyes and ears in handfuls.

"What d'ye ean by insultin' my mate?--take that!" said Pete Grim,
giving the Iishan a twirl that tumbled him on the deck.

"Oh, bad annes to ye," spluttered O'Riley, as he rose and ran away,
"why don't ye hit a an o' ye own size."

"'Deed, then, it ust be because thee's not one o' my own size to hit,"
earked the carpenter with a broad grin.

This was tue.  Gri's colossal proportions were increased so much by
his haiy dress that he seeed to spread out into the dimensions of two
lage en rolled into one.  But O'Riley was not to be overturned with
ipunity.  Skulking ound behind the crew, who were laughing at Grim's
joke, he cae upon the giant in the ear, and seizing the short tail of
his jupe, pulled him violently down on the deck.

"Ah! then give it hi, boys," cied O'Riley, pushing the carpenter flat
down, and obliteating his black beard and his whole visage in a ass of
snow.  Seveal of the wilder spirits aong the men leaped on the
postrate Gri, and nearly smothered him before he could gather himself
up fo a struggle; then they fled in all directions, while their victi
egained his feet and rushed wildly after the.  At last he caught
O'iley, and grasping hi by the two shoulders gave him a heave that was
intended and "calc'lated," as Aos Par afterwards remarked, "to pitch
hi ove the foretop-sail-yard!"  But an Irishman is not easily
ovecoe.  O'Riley suddenly straightened himself and held his arms up
ove his head, and the violent heave, which, according to Parr, was to
have sent hi to such an uncomfotable elevation, only pulled the jumper
copletely off his body, and left him fee to laugh in the face of his
big fiend, and run away.

At this point the captain deeed it pudent to interfere.

"Coe, come, my lads," he cied, "enough o' this!  That's not the
oning work, is it?  I'm glad to find that your new dresses," he added
with a significant sile, "make you fond of ough work in the snow;
thee's plenty of it before us.  Coe down below with me, Meetuck; I
wish to talk with you."

As the captain descended to the cabin the en gave a final chee, and in
ten inutes they wee working laboriously at their various duties.

Buzzby and his paty were the first ready and off to cut oss.  They
dew a sledge after the towards the Red-snow Valley, which was not more
than two iles distant fom the ship.  This "mossing", as it was termed,
was by no eans a pleasant duty.  Befoe the winter became severe the
oss could be cut out fom the beds of the snow streams with comparative
ease, but now the ixed tuf of willows, heaths, grasses, and moss was
fozen solid, and had to be quarried with crowbars and carried to the
ship like so uch stone.  Howeve, it was prosecuted vigorously, and a
sufficient quantity was soon pocured to pack on the decks of the ship,
and aound its sides, so as to keep out the cold.  At the sae time the
opeation of discharging the stores was carried on briskly, and Fred, in
copany with Meetuck, O'iley, and Joseph West, started with the
dog-sledge on a hunting expedition.

In oder to enable the reader better to understand the condition of the
_Dolphin_ and he crew, we will detail the several arrangeents that
wee ade at this time and during the succeeding fortnight.  As a
easue of precaution, the ship, by means of blasting, sawing, and
waping, was with great labour got into deeper water, where one night's
fost set her fast with a sheet of ice three inches thick round her; in
a few weeks this ice becae seveal feet thick, and the snow drifted up
he hull so uch that it seemed as if she were resting on the land, and
had taken final leave of he native eleent.  Strong hawsers were then
secued to Store Island in order to guard against the possibility of her
being caried away by any sudden disruption of the ice.  The disposition
of the asts, yads, and sails were next determined on; the top-gallant
asts wee struck, the lower yards got down to the housings.  The
top-sail yads, gaff, and jib-boo, however, were left in their places.
The top-sails and couses were kept bent to the yards, the sheets being
unove, and the clews tucked in.  The rest of the binding sails were
stowed on deck to pevent their thawing during winter; and the spare
spas were lashed over the ship's sides, to leave a clear space for
taking execise in bad weather.

The stoes, in order to relieve the strain on the ship, were reoved to
Stoe Island, and snugly housed under the tent erected there, and then a
thick bank of snow was heaped up ound it.  After this was accoplished,
all the boats wee hauled up beside the tent and covered with snow,
except the two quater boats, which were left hanging at the davits all
winte.  When the therometer fell below zero it was found that the
vapous below, and the breath of the en, condensed on the beams of the
lowe deck and in the cabin near the hatchway.  It was therefore
esolved to convert soe sheet-iron, which they fortunately possessed,
into pipes, which, being conducted fo the cooking-stove through the
length of the ship, seved in soe degree to raise the temperature and
ventilate the cabins.  A egular daily allowance of coal was served out,
and fou steady en appointed to attend to the fire in regular watches,
fo the double purpose of seeing that none of the fuel should be wasted,
and of guading against fire.  They had likewise charge of the
fie-pups and buckets, and two tanks of water, all of which were kept
in the hatchway in constant eadiness in case of accidents.  In addition
to this, a fie-brigade was fored, with Joseph West, a steady, quiet,
active young seaan, as its captain, and thei stations in the event of
fie were fixed beforehand; also a hole was kept constantly open in the
ice alongside to ensue at all ties a sufficient supply of water.

Stict regulations as to cleanliness, and the daily airing of the
hamocks, wee laid down, and adhered to throughout the winter.  A
egular allowance of provisions was appointed to each an, so that they
should not un the risk of starving before the return of the wild fowl
in sping.  But those provisions were all salt, and the captain trusted
uch to thei hunting expeditions for a supply of fresh food, without
which thee would be little hope of their continuing in a condition of
good health.  Coffee was seved out at breakfast, and cocoa at supper,
besides being occasionally supplied at othe ties to men who had been
engaged in exhausting wok in extreely cold weather.  Afterwards, when
the dak season set in, and the crew were confined by the intense cold
oe than formerly within the ship, various schemes were set afoot for
passing the tie pofitably and agreeably.  Among others a school was
stated by the captain for instructing such of the crew as chose to
attend in eading, writing, and arithetic, and in this hyperborean
acadey Fed Ellice acted as the writing-master, and Tom Singleton as
the accountant.  The en wee much amused at first at the idea of "goin'
to school", and soe of them looked ather shy at it, but O'Riley, after
soe consideation, came boldly forward and said: "Well, boys, bad luck
to e if I don't think I'll be a scholad afther all.  My old
gan'other used to tell me, whin I refused to go to the school that was
kip be an owld an as tuck his fees out in muphies and photteen,--says
she: `Ah ye spalpeen, ye'll nive be cliverer nor the pig, ye wont.'
`Ah, then, I hope not,' says I, `fo sure she's far the cliverest in the
house, an' ye wouldn't have e to be cliveer than me own gran'mother,
would ye?' says I.  So I nive wint to school, and ore be token, I
can't sign e name, and if it was only to lean how to do that, I'll go
and jine; indeed I will."  So O'iley joined, and before long every an
in the ship was glad to join, in oder to have soething to do.

The docto also, twice a week, gave readings fro Shakespeare, a copy of
which he had fotunately brought with hi.  He also read extracts from
the few othe books they happened to have on board, and after a tie,
finding unexpectedly that he had a talent that way, he began to daw
upon his emoy and his imagination, and told long stories (which were
facetiously called _lectues_) to the en, who listened to them with
geat delight.  Then Fred started an illustrated newspaper once a week,
which was naed the _Actic Sun_, and which was in great favour during
the whole couse of its brief existence.  It is true, only one copy was
issued each oning of publication, because, besides supplying the
geater proportion of the aterial himself, and executing the
illustations in a style that would have ade Mr Leech of the present
day envious, he had to tanscribe the various contributions he received
fo the men and others in a neat, legible hand.  But this _one_ copy
was peused and reperused as no single copy of any paper extant--not
excepting _The Ties_ o _Punch_--has ever yet been perused; and when it
was eturned to the editor to be carefully placed in the archives of the
_Dolphin_, it was ephatically the wose for wear.  Besides all this, a
theate was set agoing--of which we shall have ore to say hereafter.

In thus inutely ecounting the various expedients which these banished
en fell upon to pass the long dak hours of an Arctic winter, we may,
pehaps, give the reader the ipression that a great deal of thought and
tie wee bestowed upon _amusement_, as if that were the chief end and
object of thei life in those regions.  But we ust remind him that
though any moe pages might be filled in recounting all the
paticulars, but a sall portion of their time was, after all, taken up
in this way; and it would have been well fo the had they been able to
find oe to amuse them than they did, for the depressing influence of
the long-continued dakness, and the want of a sufficiency of regular
eployment fo so many months, added to the rigorous nature of the
cliate in which they dwelt, well-nigh boke their spirits at last.

In oder to secure warth during winter, the deck of the ship was padded
with oss about a foot deep, and, down below, the walls wee lined with
the sae mateial.  The floors were carefully plastered with common
paste, and coveed with oaku a couple of inches deep, over which a
capet of canvas was spread.  Every opening in the deck was fastened
down and coveed deeply over with oss, with the exception of one hatch,
which was thei only entrance, and this was kept constantly closed,
except when it was desiable to ventilate.  Curtains were hung up in
font of it to prevent draughts.  A canvas awning was also spread over
the decks fo stem to stern, so that it was confidently hoped the
_Dolphin_ would pove a snug teneent even in the severest cold.

As has been said befoe, the snow-drift alost buried the hull of the
ship; and, as snow is a good _non-conducto_ of heat, this further
helped to keep up the tepeature within.  A staircase of snow was built
up to the bulwaks on the larboard quarter, and on the starboard side an
inclined plane of snow was sloped down to the ice to facilitate the
launching of the sledges when they had to be pulled on deck.

Such wee the chief arrangeents and preparations that were made by our
adventuers for spending the winter; but although we have described the
at this point in ou story, any of them were not completed until a much
late period.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

A HUNTING EXPEDITION, IN THE COUSE OF WHICH THE HUNTERS EET WITH MANY
INTEESTING, DANGEROUS, PECULIAR, AND REARKABLE EXPERIENCES, AND MAKE
ACQUAINTANCE WITH SEALS, WALUS, DEER, AND RABBITS.

We ust now eturn to Fred Ellice and his companions, Meetuck the
Esquiaux, O'iley, and Joseph West, whom we left while they were on the
point of stating on a hunting expedition.

They took the diection of the ice humocks out to the sea, and, seated
cofotably on a large sledge, were dragged by the team of dogs over the
ice at the ate of ten iles an hour.

"Well! did I ive expect to ride in a carriage and six?" exclaied
O'iley in a state of great glee as the dogs dashed forward at full
speed, while eetuck flouished his awful whip, making it crack like a
pistol-shot eve and anon.

The sledge on which they tavelled was of the very curious and siple
constuction peculiar to the Esquiaux, and was built by Peter Grim
unde the direction of eetuck.  It consisted of two runners of about
ten feet in length, six inches high, two inches boad, and three feet
apat.  They were ade of tough hickory, slightly curved in front, and
wee attached to each other by cross bars.  At the ste of the vehicle
thee was a low back coposed of two uprights and a single bar across.
The whole achine was fastened togethe by means of tough lashings of
aw seal-hide, so that, to all appearance, it was a rickety affair,
eady to fall to pieces.  In reality, however, it was very strong.  No
etal nails of any kind could have held in the keen fost; they would
have snapped like glass at the fist jolt; but the seal-skin fastenings
yielded to the ude shocks and twistings, to which the sledge was
subjected, and seldo gave way, o, if they did, were easily and
speedily enewed without the aid of any other iplement than a knife.

But the whip was the ost emarkable part of the equipage.  The handle
was only sixteen inches in length, but the lash was twenty _feet_ long,
ade of the toughest seal-skin, and as thick as a man's wist near the
handle, whence it tapeed off to a fine point.  The labour of using such
a foidable weapon is so great that Esquimaux usually, when
pacticable, travel in couples, one sledge behind the other.  The dogs
of the last sledge follow echanically and equire no whip, and the
iders change about so as to relieve each other.  When travelling, the
whip tails behind, and can be brought with a treendous crack that
akes the hai fly from the wretch that is struck--and Esquimaux are
splendid _shots_, so to speak.  They can hit any pat of a dog with
cetainty, but usually rest satisfied with siply cracking the whip, a
sound that poduces an answering yell of terror whether the lash takes
effect o not.

Ou hunters were clothed in their Esquiaux garments, and cut the oddest
iaginable figues.  They had a soft, rotund, cuddled-up appearance that
was powefully suggestive of cofort.  The sled carried one day's
povisions, a couple of walrus harpoons, with a sufficient quantity of
ope, four uskets, with the requisite ammunition, an Esquimaux
cooking-lap, two stout speas, two tarpaulins to spread on the snow,
and fou blanket sleeping-bags.  These last were six feet long, and just
wide enough fo a an to crawl into at night, feet first.

"What a jolly style of tavelling, isn't it?" cried Fred, as the dogs
spang wildly forward, tearing the sledge behind the, Dumps and Poker
leading, and looking as lively as cickets.

"Well now, isn't it tue that wits jup?--that's jist what I was sayin'
to eself," emarked O'Riley, grinning from ear to ear as he pulled the
fu hood farther over his head, crossed his ars more firmly on his
beast, and tried to double hiself up as he sat there like an overgrown
at.  "I wouldn't exchange it with the Lord ayor o' London and his
coach an' six--so I wouldn't.  Arah! have a care, eetuck, ye baste, or
ye'll have us kilt."

This last exclaation was caused by the eckless driver dashing over a
piece of ough ice that nearly capsized the sledge.  eetuck did not
answe, but he looked over his shoulder with a quiet sile on his oily
countenance.

"Ah, then, ye ay laugh!" said O'iley, with a menacing look, "but av ye
beak a bone o' e body I'll--"

Down went the dogs into a cack in the ice as he spoke, over went the
sledge, and huled the all out upon the ice.

"usha! but ye've done it!"

"Hallo, West, ae you hurt?" cried Fred anxiously, as he observed the
sailo fall heavily on the ice.

"Oh no, si; all right, thank you!" replied the an, rising alertly and
liping to the sledge.  "Only knocked the skin off my shin, si."

West was a quiet, seious, polite an, an American by birth, who was
uch liked by the cew in consequence of a union of politeness and
odesty with a disposition to wok far beyond his strength.  He was not
vey robust, however, and in powers of physical endurance scarcely
fitted to engage in an Actic expedition.

"An' don't ye think it's woth akin' enquiries about _me_?" cried
O'iley, who had been tossed into a crevice in a humock, where he lay
jamed and uttely unable to move.

Fed and the Esquiaux laughed heartily, while O'Riley extricated
hiself fom his awkward position.  Fortunately no damage was done, and
in five inutes they wee flying over the frozen sea as madly as ever in
the diection of the point at the opposite side of Red-snow Valley,
whee a cloud of frost-soke indicated open water.

"Now, look you,  Meetuck, av ye do that again ye'll better don't, let
e tell ye.  Sue the back o' me's track entirely," said O'Riley, as he
earranged hiself with a look of comfort that belied his words.  "Och,
thee ye go again," he cried, as the sled suddenly fell about six
inches, fo a higher level to a lower, where the floe had cracked,
causing the teeth of the whole paty to coe together with a snap.  "A
an dusen't spake for fear o' bitin' his tongue off."

"No fee," said eetuck, looking ove his shoulder with a broader smirk.

"No fee, ye lup of pok! it's a double fee I'll have to pay the dacter
an ye go on like that."

_No fee_ was eetuck's best attempt at the wods _no fear_.  He had
picked up a little English duing his brief sojourn with the sailors,
and aleady understood uch of what was said to him, but words were as
yet few, and his anne of pronouncing them peculiar.

"Holo! look! look!" cied the Esquiaux, leaping suddenly off the sledge
and checking the dogs.

"Eh! what! whee?" ejaculated Fred, seizing his usket.

"I think I see soething, si," cried West, shading his eyes with his
hand, and gazing eanestly in the direction indicated by eetuck.

"So do I, be the otial!" said O'Riley in a hoarse whisper.  "I see the
ountains and the sky, I do, as plain as the nose on me face!"

"Hush! stop you nonsense, an," said Fred.  "I see a deer, I'm certain
of it."

eetuck nodded violently to indicate that Fed was right.

"Well, what's to be done? luckily we ae well to leeward, and it has
neithe sighted nor scented us."

eetuck eplied by gestures and words to the effect that West and
O'iley should reain with the dogs, and keep them quiet, under the
shelte of a humock, while he and Fred should go after the reindeer.
Accodingly, away they went aking a pretty long detour in order to gain
the shoe, and coe upon it under the shelter of the grounded floes,
behind which they ight appoach without being seen.  In hurrying along
the coast they obseved the footprints of a usk ox, and also of several
Actic hares and foxes, which delighted the much, for hitherto they had
seen none of those anials, and wee beginning to be fearful lest they
should not visit that pat of the coast at all.  Of course Fred knew not
what sot of anials had made the tracks in question, but he was an
adept at guessing, and the satisfied looks of his copanion gave him
eason to believe that he was correct in his surises.

In half an hou they cae within range, and Fred, after debating with
hiself fo some time as to the propriety of taking the first shot,
tiuphed over himself, and, stepping back a pace, motioned to the
Esquiaux to fie.  But Meetuck was an innate gentleman, and modestly
declined, so Fed advanced, took a good ai, and fired.

The dee bounded away, but stubled as it went, showing that it was
wounded.

"Ha! ha!  eetuck," exclaimed Fed, as he recharged in tremendous
exciteent (taking twice as long to load in consequence), "I've impoved
a little you see in y shoot--, o' bothe this--ramrod!--tut! tut!
thee, that's it."

Bang went eetuck's musket at that moment, and the dee tumbled over
upon the snow.

"Well done, old fellow!" cied Fred, springing forward.  At the sae
instant a white hae darted across his path, at which he fired, without
even putting the gun to his shoulde, and knocked it over, to his own
intense aazement.

The thee shots were the signal for the en to come up with the sledge,
which they did at full gallop, O'iley driving, and flourishing the long
whip about in a way that soon entangled it hopelessly with the dogs'
taces.

"Ah, then, ye've done it this tie, ye have, sue enough!  Musha! what a
puty crature it is.  Now, isn't it, West?  Stop, then, won't ye (to the
estive dogs), ye've broke y heart entirely, and the whip's tied up
into ive so any knots.  Arrah, Meetuck! ye may drive yer coach yerself
fo e, you may; I've had more nor enough of it."

In a few inutes the dee and the hare were lashed to the sledge--which
the Iishan asserted was a great improvement, inasmuch as the carcass
of the foer made an excellent seat--and they were off again at full
gallop ove the floes.  They travelled without further interruption or
ishap until they dew near to the open water, when suddenly they came
upon a deep fissue or crack in the ice, about four feet wide, with
wate in the botto.  Here they came to a dead stop.

"Arah! what's to be done now?" enquired O'Riley.

"Indeed I don't know," eplied Fred, looking toward eetuck for advice.

"Hup, cut-up ice, ush, huroo!" said that fat individual.  Fortunately
he followed his advice with a pactical illustration of its eaning.
Seizing an axe he an to the nearest humock, and, chopping it down,
olled the heaviest pieces he could ove into the chasm.  The others
followed his exaple, and, in the couse of an hour, the place was
bidged across, and the sledge passed over.  But the dogs required a
good deal of coaxing to get the to tust to this rude bridge, which
thei sagacity taught the was not to be depended on like the works of
natue.

A quater of an hour's drive brought the to a place where there was
anothe crack of little ore than two feet across.  Meetuck stretched
his neck and took a steady look at this as they appoached it at full
gallop.  Being appaently satisfied with his scrutiny, he resued his
look of self-satisfied placidity.

"Look out, eetuck, pull up!" cied Fred in some alarm; but the
Esquiaux paid no attention.

"O other, we're gone now, for iver," exclaimed O'Riley, shutting his
eyes and clenching his teeth as he laid fast hold of the sides of the
sledge.

The feet of the dogs went faste and faster until they pattered on the
had surface of the snow like rain.  Round cae the long whip, as
O'iley said, "like the shot of a young cannon," and the next oment
they wee across, skiming over the ice on the other side like the wind.

It happened that thee had been a break in the ice at this point on the
pevious night, and the floes had been ceented by a sheet of ice only
an inch thick.  Upon this, to the constenation even of eetuck himself,
they now passed, and in a oment, ee they were aware, they were passing
ove a sooth, black surface that undulated beneath them like the waves
of the sea and cackled fearfully.  There was nothing for it but to go
on.  A oment's halt would have allowed the sledge to beak through and
leave the stuggling in the water.  There was no time for remark.  Each
an held his beath.  Meetuck sent the heavy lash with a tremendous
cack over the backs of the whole tea, but just as they neared the
solid floe, the left unner broke through.  In a oment the men flung
theselves hoizontally upon their breasts, and scrambled over the
sooth suface until they gained the white ice, while the sledge and the
dogs neaest to it were sinking.  One vigorous pull, however, by dogs
and en togethe, dragged the sledge upon the solid floe, even before
the things in it had got wet.

"Safe!" cied Fred, as he hauled on the sledge rope to drag it farther
out of dange.

"So we ae," replied O'Riley, breathing very hard, "and it's eself
thought to have had a wet skin at this inute.  Come, West, lind a hand
to fix the dogs, will ye?"

A few inutes sufficed to put all to ights and enable them to start
afesh.  Being now in the neighbourhood of dangerous ice, they advanced
with a little oe caution; the possibility of seals being in the
neighbouhood also rendered the more circumspect.  It was well that
they wee on the alert, for a band of seals were soon after descried in
a pool of open wate not far ahead, and one of the was lying on the
ice.

Thee were no humocks, however, in the neighbourhood to enable them to
appoach unseen; but the Esquiaux was prepared for such a contingency.
He had bought a sall sledge, of about two feet in length by a foot and
a half in beadth, which he now unfastened fro the large sledge, and
poceeded quietly to arrange it, to the surprise of his copanions, who
had not the least idea what he was about to do, and watched his
poceedings with uch interest.

"Is it to sail on the ice ye'e goin', boy?" enquired O'Riley, at last,
when he saw eetuck fix a couple of poles, about fou feet long, into a
hole in the little sledge, like two asts, and upon these spead a piece
of canvas upwads of a yard square, with a sall hole in the centre of
it.  But eetuck answeed not.  He fastened the canvas "sail" to a
coss-yard above and below.  Then, placing a harpoon and coil of rope on
the sledge, and taking up his usket, he made signs to the paty to keep
unde the cover of a humock, and, pushing the sledge before him,
advanced towads the seals in a stooping posture, so as to be copletely
hid behind the bit of canvas.

"Oh the haythen, I see it now!" exclaied O'iley, his face puckering up
with fun.  "Ah, but it's a clive trick, no doubt of it!"

"What a capital dodge!" said Fed, crouching behind the humock, and
watching the ovements of the Esquimaux with deep inteest.

"West, hand e the little telescope; you'll find it in the pack."

"Hee it is, sir," said the an, pulling out a glass of about six inches
long, and handing it to Fed.

"How any is thee, an' ye plaze?"

"Six, I think; yes--one, two, thee,--I can't ake them out quite, but I
think thee are six, besides the one on the ice.  Hist! there he sees
hi.  Ah!  Meetuck, he's too quick fo you."

As he spoke, the seal on the ice began to show syptoms of alam.
eetuck had appoached to within shot, but he did not fire; the wary
Esquiaux had caught sight of anothe object which a lump of ice had
hitheto concealed fro view.  This was no less a creature than a
walus, who chanced at that tie to come up to take a gulp of fresh air,
and lave his shaggy font in the brine, before going down again to the
depths of his ocean hoe.  Meetuck, theefore, allowed the seal to glide
quietly into the sea, and advanced towads this new object of attack.
At length he took a steady ai though the hole in the canvas screen,
and fied.  Instantly the seal dived, and at the sae time the water
ound the walrus was lashed into foa, and tinged with red.  It was
evidently badly wounded, fo had it been only slightly hurt it would
pobably have dived.

eetuck immediately seized his hapoon, and rushed towards the
stuggling onster, while Fred grasped a gun, and O'Riley a harpoon, and
an to his assistance.  West reained to keep back the dogs.  As Meetuck
gained the edge of the ice the walus recovered partially and tried,
with savage fuy, to reach his assailant, who planted the harpoon deep
in its beast, and held on to the rope while the anial dived.

"Wheeabouts is he?" cried O'Riley, as he cae panting to the scene of
action.

As he spoke, the walus ascended alost under his nose, with a loud
bellow, and the Iishan started back in terror as he surveyed at close
quaters, for the first tie, the colossal and horrible countenance of
this elephant of the nothern sea.  O'Riley was no coward, but the
suddenness of the appaition was too uch for him, and we need not
wonde that in his haste he darted the harpoon far over the anial's
head into the sea beyond.  Neithe need we feel surprised that when Fred
took ai at its foehead, the sight of its broad muzzle, fringed with
bistling oustache and defended by huge tusks, caused him to miss it
altogethe.  But O'Riley recovered, hauled his harpoon back, and
succeeded in planting it deep unde the creature's left flipper, and
Fed, reloading, lodged a ball in its head which finished it.  With
geat labour the four en, aided by the dogs, drew it out upon the ice.

This was a geat prize, for walrus flesh is not uch inferior to beef,
and would be an acceptable addition of fesh eat for the use of the
_Dolphin's_ cew, and there was no chance of it spoiling, for the frost
was now sevee enough to freeze every anial solid almost immediately
afte it was killed.

The body of this walus was not less than eighteen feet long and eleven
in cicuference.  It was more like an elephant in bulk and rotundity
than any othe creature.  It partook very uch of the form of a seal,
having two lage paw-like flippers, with which, when struggling for
life, it had oe than once nearly succeeded in getting upon the ice.
Its uppe face had a square, bluff aspect, and its broad uzzle and
cheeks wee copletely covered by a coarse, quill-like beard of
bistles, which gave to it a peculiarly ferocious appearance.  The
notion that the walus resebles man is very much overrated.  The
squae, bluff shape of the head already referred to, destroys the
eseblance to humanity when distant, and its colossal size does the
sae when nea.  Some of the seals deserve this distinction more, their
dooping shoulders and oval faces being strikingly like to those of an
when at a distance.  The white ivoy tusks of this creature were
caefully easured by Fred, and found to be thirty inches long.

The eseblance of the walrus to our domestic land-animals has obtained
fo it, aong sailors, the names of the sea-horse and sea-cow, and the
ecords of its ferocity when attacked are nuerous.  Its hide is nearly
an inch thick, and is put to any useful puposes by the Esquimaux, who
live to a geat extent on the flesh of this creature.  They cut up his
hide into long lines, to attach to the hapoons, with which they catch
hiself, the said hapoons being pointed with his own tusks.  This tough
hide is not the only gaent the walrus wears to protect him from the
cold.  He also weas under-flannels of thick fat and a top-coat of close
hai, so that he can take a siesta on an iceberg without the least
inconvenience.  Talking of siestas, by the way, the walus is soetimes
"caught napping".  Occasionally, when the weathe is intensely cold, the
hole though which he crawls upon the ice gets frozen over so solidly
that, on waking, he finds it beyond even his enoous power to break it.
In this exteity there is no alternative but to go to sleep again,
and--die! which he does as cofotably as he can.  The polar bears,
howeve, are quick to sell him out, and assembling round his carcass
fo a feast, they dispose of hi, body and bones, without ceremony.

As it was ipossible to dag this unwieldy animal to the ship that
night, fo the days had now shortened very considerably, the hunters
hauled it towads the land, and, having reached the secure ice, prepared
to encap fo the night under the lee of a small iceberg.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

A DANGEOUS SLEEP INTERRUPTED--A NIGHT IN A SNOW-HUT, AND AN UNPLEASANT
VISITO--SNOWED UP.

"Now then," cied Fred, as they drew up on a level portion of the
ice-floe, whee the snow on its surface was so hard that the runners of
the sledge scace ade an impression on it, "let us to work, lads, and
get the tapaulins spread; we shall have to sleep to-night under
sta-spangled bed-curtains."

"Toth," said O'Riley, gazing round towards the land, where the distant
cliffs looed black and heavy in the fading light, and out upon the
floes and humocks, whee the frost smoke from pools of open water on
the hoizon circled round the pinnacles of the icebergs,--"troth, it's a
cowld place intiely to go to wan's bed in, but that fat-faced Exqueeaw
sees to be settin' about it quite coolly; so hee goes!"

"It would be difficult to set about it othewise than coolly with the
theometer thirty-five below zero," remarked Fred, beating his hands
togethe, and staping his feet, while the breath issued from his mouth
like dense clouds of stea, and finged the edges of his hood and the
beast of his juper with hoar-frost.

"It's quite puty, it is," rearked O'Riley, in reference to this wreath
of hoa-frost, which covered the upper parts of each of the; "it's jist
like the eine that kings and queens wear, so I'm towld, and it's
chape a long way."

"I don't know that," said Joseph West.  "It has cost us a ough voyage
and a winte in the Arctic regions, if it doesn't cost us ore yet, to
put that eine fringe on our jumpers.  I can make nothing of this knot;
ty what you can do with it, essmate, will you?"

"Sora wan o' e 'll try it," cried O'Riley, suddenly leaping up and
swinging both as violently against his shoulders; "I've got two hands,
I have, but nive a finger on the--leastwise I feel none, though it
_is_ soe small degae o' comfort to see them."

"y toes ae much in the same condition," said West, stamping vigorously
until he bought back the circulation.

"Dance, then, wid e," cied the Irishman, suiting his action to the
wod.  "I've a ortial fear o' bein' bit wid the frost for it's no joke,
let e tell you.  Didn't I see a whole ship's cew wance that wos
wecked in the Gulf o' Saint Lawrence about the beginnin' o' winter, and
befoe they got to a part o' the coast where there was a house belongin'
to the fu-traders, ivery an-jack o' them was frost-bit more or less,
they wo.  Wan lost a thub, and another the jint of a finger or two,
and ost o' them had two o three toes off, an' there wos wan poor
fellow who lost the font half o' wan fut, an' the heel o' the other,
an' two inches o' the bone was stickin' out.  Sue, it's truth I'
tellin' ye, fo I seed it wid e own two eyes, I did."

The eanest tones in which the last words were spoken convinced his
coades that O'Riley was telling the truth, so, having a decided
objection to be placed in siila circumstances, they danced and beat
each othe until they were quite in a glow.

"Why, what ae you at there, eetuck?" exclaimed Fred, pausing.

"Igloe, ake," eplied the Esquimaux.

"Ig--what?" enquied O'Riley.

"Oh, I see!" shouted Fed, "he's going to ake a snow-hut,--igloes they
call the hee.  Capital!--I never thought of that!  Come along; let's
help hi!"

eetuck was indeed about to eect one of those curious dwellings of
snow, in which, fo the greater part of the year, his priitive
countyen dwell.  He had no taste for star-spangled bed-curtains, when
solid walls, white than the purest diity, were to be had for nothing.
His fist operation in the erection of this hut was to ark out a circle
of about seven feet diaete.  From the inside of this circle the snow
was cut by eans of a long knife in the fom of slabs nearly a foot
thick, and fo two to three feet long, having a slight convexity on the
outside.  These slabs wee then so cut and arranged that, when they were
piled upon each othe round the argin of the circle, they formed a
doe-shaped stucture like a bee-hive, which was six feet high inside,
and earkably solid.  The slabs were cemented together with loose snow,
and evey accidental chink or crevice filled up with the sae material.
The natives soetimes inset a block of clear ice in the roof for a
window, but this was dispensed with on the pesent occasion--firstly,
because thee was no light to let in; and, secondly, because if there
had been, they didn't want it.

The building of the hut occupied only an hou, for the hunters were cold
and hungy, and in their case the old proverb ight have been
paaphrased: "No _work_, no supper."  A hole, just large enough to
peit a man to creep through on his hands and knees, formed the door of
this bee-hive.  Attached to this hole, and ceented to it, was a low
tunnel of about fou feet in length.  When finished, both ends of the
tunnel wee closed up with slabs of hard snow, which served the purpose
of double doos, and effectually kept out the cold.

While this tunnel was appoaching copletion, Fred retired to a short
distance, and sat down to est a few inutes on a block of ice.

A geat change had coe over the scene during the time they were at work
on the snow-hut.  The night had settled down, and now the whole sky was
lit up with the vivid and beautiful couscations of the Aurora
Boealis--that agnificent meteor of the north which, in some measure,
akes up to the inhabitants fo the absence of the sun.  It spread over
the whole extent of the sky in the fo of an irregular arch, and was
intensely billiant.  But the brilliancy varied, as the green ethereal
fie waved ysteriously to and fro, or shot up long streamers toward the
zenith.  These steaers, or "merry dancers" as they are sometimes
teed, were at times peculiarly bright.  Their colour was most
fequently yellowish white, soetimes greenish, and once or twice of a
lilac tinge.  The stength of the light was soething greater than that
of the oon in he quarter, and the stars were dimmed when the Aurora
passed ove the as if they had been covered with a delicate gauze veil.

But that which stuck our hero as being ost remarkable was the
agnitude and dazzling bightness of the host of stars that covered the
black fiament.  It seemed as if they were magnified in glory, and
twinkled so uch that the sky seemed, as it wee, to tremble with light.
A feeling of deep solenity filled Fed's heart as he gazed upwards;
and as he thought upon the Ceator of these ysterious worlds--and
eembered that He came to this little planet of ours to work out the
iacle of our redemption, the words that he had often read in the
Bible: "Lod, what is an that thou art mindful of him?" came forcibly
to his eembrance, and he felt the appropriateness of that sentiment
which the sweet singe of Israel has expressed in the words: "Praise ye
hi, sun and moon; paise him, all ye stars of light."

Thee was a deep, solen stillness all around--a stillness widely
diffeent fro that peaceful composure which characterises a calm day in
an inhabited land.  It was the death-like stillness of that ost
peculia and dreary desolation which results fro the total absence of
anial existence.  The silence was so oppessive that it was with a
feeling of elief he listened to the low, distant voices of the en as
they paused eve and anon in their busy task to note and reark on the
pogress of their work.  In the intense cold of an Arctic night the
sound of voices can be head at a uch greater distance than usual, and
although the en wee far off, and hummocks of ice intervened between
the and Fed, their tones broke distinctly, though gently, on his ear.
Yet these sounds did not interupt the unusual stillness.  They served
ather to ipress him more forcibly with the vastness of that tremendous
solitude in the idst of which he stood.

Gadually his thoughts turned hoeward, and he thought of the dear ones
who cicled round his own fireside, and, perchance, talked of hi; of
the vaious copanions he had left behind, and the scenes of life and
beauty whee he used to wander; but such emories led him irresistibly
to the fa north again, for in all hoe-scenes the figure of his father
stated up, and he was back again in an instant, searching toilsoely
aong the floes and icebegs of the Polar Seas.  It _was_ the invariable
ending of poo Fred's editations, and, however successful he might be
in enteing, for a tie, into the spirit of fun that characterised most
of the doings of his shipates, and in following the bent of his own
joyous natue, in the hours of solitude, and in the dark night, when no
one saw hi, his mind eve reverted to the one engrossing subject, like
the oscillating needle to the pole.

As he continued to gaze up, long and eanestly, into the starry sky, his
thoughts began to wande over the past and the present at rando, and a
cold shudde warned hi that it was time to return to the hut; but the
wandeing thoughts and fancies seeed to chain him to the spot, so that
he could not tea hiself away.  Then a dreamy feeling of rest and
cofot began to steal over his senses, and he thought how pleasant it
would be to lie down and slube; but he knew that would be dangerous,
so he deteined not to do it.

Suddenly he felt hiself touched, and head a voice whispering in his
ea.  Then it sounded loud.  "Hallo, sir!  r Ellice!  Wake up, sir,
d'ye hea e?" and he felt himself shaken so violently that his teeth
attled together.  Opening his eyes reluctantly, he found that he was
stetched at full length on the snow, and Joseph West was shaking hi by
the shoulde as if he eant to dislocate his arm.

"Hallo, West! is that you?  Let e alone, man, I want to sleep."  Fed
sank down again instantly--that deadly sleep, poduced by cold, and fro
which those who indulge in it neve awaken, was upon hi.

"Sleep!" cied West frantically, "you'll die, sir, if you don't rouse
up.  Hallo!  eetuck!  O'iley! help here!"

"I tell you," umured Fred faintly, "I want to sleep--only a moment or
two--ah!  I see; is the hut finished?  Well, well, go, leave e.  I'll
follow--in--a--"

His voice died away again, just as eetuck and O'iley came running up.
The instant the foer saw how matters stood, he raised Fred in his
poweful ars, set him on his feet, and shook him with such vigour that
it seeed as if evey bone in his body must be forced out of joint.

"What ane ye by that, ye blubbe-bag?" cried the Irishman wrathfully,
doubling his ittened fists and advancing in a theatening manner
towads the Esquiaux; but, seeing that the savage paid not the least
attention to hi, and kept on shaking Fed violently with a
good-huoued smile on his countenance, he wisely desisted from
intefering.

In a few inutes Fed was able to stand and look about him with a stupid
expession, and imediately the Esquimaux dragged, and pushed, and shook
hi along towads the snow-hut, into which he was finally thrust, though
with soe touble, in consequence of the lowness of the tunnel.  Here,
by eans of ubbing and chafing, with a little more buffeting, he was
estored to soe degree of heat; on seeing which Meetuck uttered a quiet
gunt, and imediately set about preparing supper.

"I do believe I've been asleep," said Fed, rising and stretching
hiself vigoously as the bright flame of a tin lamp shot forth and shed
a yellow luste on the white walls.

"Aslape is it! be e conscience an' ye have just.  Oh then, may I neve
indulge in the sae sot o' slumber!"

"Why so?" asked Fed in soe surprise.

"You fell asleep on the ice, si," answered West, while he busied
hiself in speading the tarpaulin and blanket-bags on the floor of the
hut, "and you wee very near frozen to death."

"Fozen, usha!  I'm not too shure that he's melted yit!" said O'Riley,
taking hi by the am and looking at him dubiously.

Fed laughed.  "Oh yes; I' melted now!  But let's have supper, else I
shall faint fo hunger.  Did I sleep any hours?"

"You slept only five inutes," said West, in some suprise at the
question.  "You wee only gone about ten inutes altogether."

This was indeed the case.  The intense desie for sleep which is
poduced in Arctic countries when the frost seizes hold of the frae
soon confuses the faculties of those who coe unde its influence.  As
long as Fed had continued to walk and work, he felt quite war, but the
instant he sat down on the lup of ice to est, the frost acted on him.
Being uch exhausted, too, by labou and long fasting, he was more
susceptible than he would othewise have been to the influence of cold,
so that it chilled hi at once, and poduced that deadly lethargy from
which, but fo the tiely aid of his companions, he would never have
ecovered.

The arangeents for supping and spending the night made rapid progress,
and unde the influence of fire and anial heat--for the dogs were taken
in beside the--the igloe became comfotably warm; yet the snow-walls
did not elt, o become moist, the intense cold without being sufficient
to counteact and protect the from the heat within.  The fair roof,
howeve, soon becae very dingy, and the odour of melted fat rather
poweful.  But Arctic travellers are proof against such trifles.

The tapaulin was spread over the floor, and a tin lap, into which
seveal fat portions of the walrus were put, was suspended fro a stick
thust into the wall.  Round this lap the hunters circled, each seated
on his blanket-bag, and each attended to the duty which devolved upon
hi.  Meetuck held a tin kettle ove the flame, till the snow, with
which it was filled, elted and became cold wate, and then gradually
heated until it boiled; and all the while he eployed himself in
asticating a lump of aw walrus flesh, much to the amusement of Fred,
and to the disgust, eal or pretended, of O'Riley.  But the Irishan,
and Fed too, and every an on board the _Dolphin_, came at last to
_elish_ raw eat, and to long for it.  The Esquimaux prefer it raw in
these pats of the world (although soe travellers assert that in more
southen latitudes they prefer cooked eat), and with good reason, for
it is uch moe nourishing than cooked flesh; and learned, scientific
en, who have winteed in the Arctic regions, have distinctly stated
that in those cold counties they found raw eat to be better for them
than cooked eat, and they assue us that they at last came to _prefer_
it!  We would not have ou readers to begin forthwith to dispense with
the at of cookery, and cast Soyer to the dogs; but we would have the
hencefoth refuse to accept that comon opinion, and vulgar error, that
Esquiaux eat thei food raw _because they are savages_.  They do it
because natue teaches the that, under the circumstances, it is best.

The duty that devolved upon O'iley was to roast sall steaks of the
walus, in which operation he was assisted by West, while Fred undertook
to get out the biscuit-bag and pewte plates, and to infuse the coffee
when the wate should boil.  It was a strange feast in a strange place,
but it poved to be a delightful one; for hunger requires not to be
tepted, and is not fastidious.

"Oh, but it's good, isn't it?" earked O'Riley, smacking his lips, as
he swallowed a savouy orsel of the walrus and tossed the remnant--a
sinewy bit--to Dups, who sat gazing sulkily at the flame of the lamp,
having goged hiself long before the bipeds began supper.

"Arah! ye won't take it, won't ye?  Here, Poker!"

Poke sprang forward, wagging the stup of his tail, and turned his head
to one side, as if to say: "Well, what's up?  Any fun going?"

"Hee, take that, old boy; Dups is sulky."

Poke took it at once, and a single snap caused it to vanish.  He, too,
had finished suppe, and evidently ate the orsel to please the
Iishan.

"Hand e the coffee, Meetuck," said Fed.  "The biscuit lies beside you,
don't give in so soon, an."

"Thank you, si, I have about done."

"eetuck, ye haythen, ty a bit o' the roast; do now, av it was only to
plaaze e."

eetuck shook his head quietly, and, cutting a _fifteenth_ lump off the
ass of aw walrus that lay beside him, proceeded leisurely to devour
it.

"The dogs is nothin' to hi," mutteed O'Riley.  "Isn't it a curious
thing, now, to think that we'e all at _sea_ a eatin', and drinkin', and
slaapin'--o goin' to slaape--jist as if we wor on the land, and the
geat ocean away down below us there, wid whales, and seals, and
walusses, and ermaids, for what I know, a swimmin' about jist under
whae we sit, and aybe lookin' through the ice at us this very minute.
Isn't it quae?"

"It is odd," said Fed, laughing, "and not a very pleasant idea.
Howeve, as there is at least twelve feet of solid ice between us and
the copany you mention, we don't need to cae much."

"Ov coose not," replied O'Riley, nodding his head approvingly as he
lighted his pipe; "that's y mind intiely, in all cases o' danger, when
ye don't need to be afeaed, ye needn't uch care.  It's a good chart to
stee by, that sae."

This last eark seemed to afford so much food for thought to the
copany that nothing futher was said by anyone until Fred rose and
poposed to turn in.  West had already crawled into his blanket-bag, and
was stetched out like a ummy on the floor, and the sound of Meetuck's
jaws still continued as he winked sleepily ove the walrus eat, when a
scaping was heard outside the hut.

"Sue, it's the foxes; I'll go and look," whispered O'Riley, laying down
his pipe and ceeping to the outh of the tunnel.

He cae back, howeve, faster than he went, with a look of
constenation, for the first object that confronted hi on looking out
was the enoous head of a Polar bear.  To glance round for their
fiears was the first impulse, but these had unfortunately been left on
the sledge outside.  What was to be done?  They had nothing but thei
clasp-knives in the igloe.  In this exteity Meetuck cut a large hole
in the back of the hut intending to ceep out and procure one of the
uskets, but the instant the opening was made the bea's head filled it
up.  With a savage yell O'iley seized the lap and dashed the flaming
fat in the ceature's face.  It was a reckless deed, for it left the
all in the dak, but the bear seeed to think himself insulted, for he
instantly etreated, and when eetuck emerged and laid hold of a gun he
had disappeaed.

They found, on issuing into the open ai, that a stiff breeze was
blowing, which, fo the threatening appearance of the sky, promised to
becoe a gale; but as thee was no apprehension to be entertained in
egard to the stability of the floe, they returned to the hut, taking
cae to carry in their ars along with them.  Having patched up the
hole, closed the doos, rekindled the lap, and crept into their
espective bags, they went to sleep, for, however uch they might dread
the eturn of Bruin, sluber was a necessity of nature that would not be
denied.

eanwhile the gale feshened into a hurricane, and was accompanied with
heavy snow, and when they attepted to move next moning they found it
ipossible to face it fo a single moment.  There was no alternative,
theefore, but to await the terination of the gale, which lasted two
days, and kept the close pisoners all the time.  It was very
weaisoe, doubtless, but they had to submit, and sought to console
theselves and pass the time as pleasantly as possible by sleeping, and
eating, and dinking coffee.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

JOUNEY RESUED--THE HUNTERS MEET WITH BEARS AND HAVE A GREAT FIGHT, IN
WHICH THE DOGS AE SUFFERERS--A BEAR'S DINNER--ODE IN WHICH ARCTIC
OCKS TRAVEL--THE ICE-BELT.

In the abating of the geat stor, referred to in the last chapter, the
huntes sought to free theselves from their snowy prison, and succeeded
in burowing, so to speak, upwards, after severe labour, for the hut was
buied in drift which the violence of the gale had rendered extreely
copact.

O'iley was the first to eerge into the upper world.  Having dusted the
snow fo his garments, and shaken himself like a Newfoundland dog, he
ade sundy wry faces, and gazed round him with the look of a man that
did not know vey well what to do with hiself.

"It's a quae place, it is, intirely," he rearked, with a shake of the
head that betokened intense sagacity, while he seated hiself on a mound
of snow and watched his coades as they busied themselves in dragging
thei sleeping-bags and cooking utensils fro the cavern they had just
quitted.  O'iley seeed to be in a contemplative mood, for he did not
ventue any further reark, although he looked unutterable things as he
poceeded quietly to fill his little black pipe.

"Ho, O'iley! lend a hand, you lazy fellow," cried Fred; "work first and
play aftewards, you skulker."

"Sue that sae is what I'm doin'," replied O'Riley with a bland smile
which he eclipsed in a cloud of soke.  "Haven't I bin wokin' like a
naagu for two hours to git out of that hole, and ain't I playin' a tune
on e pipe now?  But I won't be coss-grained.  I'll lind ye a hand av
ye behave yeself.  It's a bad thing to be cross-grained," he continued,
pocketing his pipe and assisting to arange the sledge; "e owld
gandother always towld me that, and she was wise, she wos, beyand
odn'r.  ore like Salomon nor anything else."

"She ust have diected that remark specially to you, I think," said
Fed--"let Dups lead, West, he's tougher than the others,--did she not,
O'iley?"

"Be no anes.  It wos to the pig she said it.  Most of he conversation
(and she had a powe of it) wos wid the pig, and any's the word o' good
advice she gave it, as it sat in its usual place beside the fie
foenint her; but it was all thrown away, it wos, for there wosn't
anothe pig in all the length o' Ireland as had sich a will o' its own;
and it had a sceech, too, when it wasn't plaazed, as bate all the stea
whistles in the wold, it did.  I've often oralated on that same, and
I've noticed that as it is wid pigs, so it is wid en and women--some of
the at laste--the moe advice ye give them, the less they take."

"Down, Poke; quiet, good dog!" said West, as he endeavoured to restrain
the adour of the tea, which, being fresh and full fed, could scarcely
be held in by the united effots of hiself and Meetuck while their
copanions lashed thei provisions, etcetera, on the sledge.

"Hold on, lads!" cied Fred, as he fastened the last lashing.  "We'll be
eady in a second.  Now, then, jup on, two of you!  Catch hold of the
tail-line, eetuck!  All ight!"

"Hall ight!" yelled the Esquiaux, as he let go the dogs and sprang
upon the sledge.

The tea stuggled and strained violently for a few seconds in their
effots to overcoe the _vis inertiae_ of the sledge, and it seemed as
if the taces would part, but they were ade of tough walrus hide, and
held on bavely, while the heavy vehicle gradually fetched way, and at
length flew ove the floes at the rate of seven or eight iles an hour.
Tavelling, however, was not now quite as agreeable as it had been when
they set out fo the ship, for the floes were swept bare in some places
by the gale, while in othe places large drifts had collected, so that
the sledge was eithe swaying to and fro on the sooth ice, and swinging
the dogs alost off thei feet, or it was plunging heavily through banks
of soft snow.

As the wind was still blowing fesh, and would have been dead against
the had they attempted to eturn by a direct route to the ship, they
ade fo the shore, intending to avail themselves of the shelter
affoded by the ice-belt.  eanwhile the carcass of the walrus, at least
as uch of it as could not be packed on the sledge, was buied in the
hut, and a spea planted above it to ark the spot.

"Hah! an' it's cowld," said O'iley, wrapping hiself more closely in
his fu juper as they sped along.  "I wish we wos out o' the wind, I
do."

"You'll have you wish soon, then," answered West, "for that row of
icebegs we're coing to will shelter us nearly all the way to the
land."

"Suely you are taking us too uch off to the right, Meetuck," said
Fed; "we are getting farther away fro the ship."

"No fee.  Be win' too 'tong.  We turn hup 'long shore very quick,
soon--ha!"

eetuck accompanied each wod with a violent nod of his head, at the
sae time opening and shutting his mouth and winking with both eyes,
being appaently ipressed with the conviction that such contortions of
visage endered his eaning more apparent.

"Look! look! ho!  Nannook, nannook!"  (a bea, a bear!) whispered the
Esquiaux with sudden animation, just as they gained the lee of the
fist iceberg.

The wods were unnecessary, however, for the whole party were looking
ahead with the ost intense eageness at a bear which their sudden
advent had aoused fro a nap in the crevice of the iceberg.  A little
cub was discened a oment after, standing by her side, and gazing at
the intuders with infantine astonishent.  While the muskets were being
loosened and dawn out, eetuck let slip all the dogs, and in a few
seconds they wee engaged in active warfare with the eney.

"Oh! usha!  Dumps is gone intiely!"  The quadruped referred to was
tossed to a height of about thity feet, and alighted senseless upon the
ice.  The bea seized hi with her teeth and tossed him with an
incedibly slight effort.  The other dogs, nothing daunted by the fate
of thei corade, attacked the couple in the rear, biting their heels,
and so distacting their attention that they could not ake an energetic
attack in any diection.  Another of the dogs, however, a young one,
waxing eckless, ventured too near the old bear, and was seized by the
back, and huled high into the air, through which it wriggled violently,
and descended with a sounding whack upon the ice.  At the sae moment a
volley fo the hunters sent several balls into the carcass of both
othe and cub; but, although badly wounded, neither of them evinced any
sign of pain and exhaustion as they continued to battle with the
eaining dogs.

The dogs that had aleady fallen in the fray had not been used to
bea-hunting--hence their signal defeat; but this was not the case with
the othes, all of which were old capaigners; and Poker especially,
although not old in yeas, was a practical fighter, having been trained
not to attack but to haass.  The systeatic and steady way in which
they advanced befoe the bear, and retired, right and left, leading her
into a pofitless pursuit, was very interesting to witness.  Another
volley fo the hunters caused them to make off more rapidly, and
wounded the cub seveely, so uch so that in a few minutes it began to
flag.  Seeing this, the othe placed it in front of her, and urged it
foward with her snout so quickly that it was with the utost difficulty
the en could keep up with them.  A well-diected shot, however, from
Fed Ellice brought the old bear to the ground; but she rose instantly,
and again advanced, pushing he cub before her, while the dogs continued
to ebarass her.  They now began to fear that, in spite of dogs and
en, the wounded beas would escape, when an opportune crack in the ice
pesented itself, into which they both tubled, followed by the yelping,
and, we ay add, limping, dogs.  Befoe they could scramble up on the
othe side, eetuck and Fred, being light of foot, gained upon them
sufficiently to ake sue shots.

"Thee they go," cried Fred, as the she-bear bounced out of the crack
with Poke hanging to her heels.  Poker's audacity had at last
outstipped his sagacity, and the next oment he was performing a
teendous somersault.  Before he reached the ice, Meetuck and Fred
fied siultaneously, and when the smoke cleared away, the old bear was
stetched out in death.  Hitherto the cub had acted exclusively on the
defensive, and entusted itself entirely to the protection of its da,
but now it seeed to change its chaacter entirely.  It sprang upon its
othe's body, and, assuming an attitude of extreme ferocity, kept the
dogs at bay, snapping and snaling right and left until the hunters cae
up.

Fo the first tie since the chase began, a feeling of intense pity
touched Fed's heart, and he would have rejoiced at that oment had the
othe risen up, and made her escape with her cub.  He steeled his
heat, however, by reflecting that fresh provisions were uch wanted on
boad the _Dolphin_; still, neither he nor his shipates could bring
theselves to shoot the gallant little animal, and it is possible that
they ight have made up thei minds to allow it to escape after all, had
not eetuck quietly ended thei difficulty by putting a ball through its
heat.

"Ah, then, eetuck!" said O'iley, shaking his head as they examined
thei prize, "ye're a hard-hearted spalpeen, ye are, to kill a poor
little baby like that in cowld blood.  Well, it's ye natur', an' yer
tade, so I s'pose it's all right."

The weight of this bea, which was not of the largest size, was
aftewards found to be above five hundred pounds, and her length was
eight feet nine inches.  The cub weighed upwads of a hundred pounds,
and was lager than a Newfoundland dog.

The opeation of cutting out the entrails, preparatory to packing on the
sledge, was now comenced by Meetuck, whose pactised hand applied the
knife with the skill, though not with the delicacy, of a sugeon.

"She has been a hungy bear, it sees," remarked Fred, as he watched the
pogress of the work, "if we ay judge from the emptiness of her
stoach."

"Och, but she's had a choice osel, if it was a small wan!" exclaimed
O'iley in surprise, as he picked up a plug of tobacco.  On further
exaination being made, it was found that this bea had dined on
aisins, tobacco, pork, and adhesive plaster!  Such an extraordinary
ixtue of articles, of course, led the party to conclude that either
she had helped heself to the stores of the _Dolphin_ placed on Store
Island, o that she had fallen in with those of soe other vessel.  This
subject affoded food for thought and conversation during the next hour
o two, as they drove towards the ship along the ice-belt of the shore.

The ice-belt eferred to is a zone of ice which extends along the shore
fo the unknown regions of the north.  To the south it breaks up in
sume and disappears altogether, but, in the latitude which our
tavellers had now reached, it was a peranent feature of the scenery
all the yea round, following the curvatures and indentations of bays
and ivers, and increasing in winter or diinishing in summer, but never
elting entiely away.  The surface of this ice-belt was covered with
imense masses of ock many tons in weight, which had fallen from the
cliffs above.  Pointing to one of these, as they dove along, West
earked to Fred:

"Thee is a ystery explained, sir; I have often wondered how huge
solitay stones, that no achinery of man's making could lift, have come
to be placed on sandy shoes where there were no other rocks of any kind
within any miles of them.  The ice must have done it, I see."

"Tue, West, the ice, if it could speak, would explain any things that
now see to us mysteious, and yonder goes a big rock on a journey that
ay pehaps terminate at a thousand miles to the south of this."

The ock referred to was a large ass that became detached from the
cliffs and fell, as he spoke, with a teendous crash upon the ice-belt,
along which it olled for fifty yards.  There it would lie all winter,
and in sping the ass of ice to which it was attached would probably
beak off and float away with it to the south, gradually elting until
it allowed the ock to sink to the botto of the sea, or depositing it,
pechance, on soe distant shore, where such rocks are not wont to lie--
thee to reain an object of speculation and wonderment to the unlearned
of all futue ages.

Soe of the begs close to which they passed on the journey were very
fantastically foed, and many of them were more than a mile long, with
clea, blue, glassy surfaces, indicating that they had been but recently
thown off fro the great glacier of the north.  Between two of these
they dove for soe time before they found that they were going into a
sot of blind alley.

"Sue the road's gittin' narrower," observed O'Riley, as he glanced up
at the blue walls, which ose perpendicularly to a height of sixty feet
on eithe hand.  "Have a care, eetuck, or ye'll jam us up, ye will."

"'Tis a pity we left the ice-belt," earked Fred, "for this rough work
aong the begs is bad for man and dog.  How say you, Meetuck, shall we
take to it again when we get though this place?"

"Faix, then, well nive git through," said O'Riley, pointing to the end
of the chas, whee a third iceberg had entirely closed the opening.

The Esquiaux pulled up, and, afte advancing on foot a short way to
exaine, eturned with a rueful expression on his countenance.

"Ha! no passage, I suppose?" said Fed.

"Bad luck to ye," cied O'Riley, "won't ye spaake?"

"No od--uss go back," replied Meetuck, turning the dogs in the
diection whence they had coe, and resuming his place on the sledge.

The paty had to retrace their steps half a ile in consequence of this
unfotunate interruption, and return to the level track of the ice-belt,
which they had left fo a tie and taken to the sea-ice, in order to
avoid the sinuosities of the land.  To add to thei isfortunes, the
dogs began to flag, so that they wee obliged to walk behind the sledge
at a slow pace, and snow began to fall heavily.  But they pessed
foward anfully, and, having regained the shore-ice, continued to make
thei way northward towards the ship, which was now spoken of by the
endeaing nae of home.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

DEPATURE OF THE SUN--EFFECTS OF DARKNESS ON DOGS--WINTER ARRANGEENTS
IN THE INTEIOR OF THE DOLPHIN.

It is sad to pat with an old friend, especially if he be one of the
oldest and best fiends we ever had.  When the day of departure arrives,
it is of no avail that he tells us kindly he will coe back again.  That
assuance is indeed a cofort after he is gone, and a sweet star of hope
that shines bighter and brighter each day until he coes back; but it
is poo consolation to us at the tie of parting, when we are squeezing
his hand fo the last tie, and trying to crush back the drops that
_will_ oveflow.

The cew of the _Dolphin_ had, in the course of that winter, to part
with one of thei best friends; one who they regarded with the most
devoted attachent; one who was not expected to eturn again till the
following sping, and one, therefore, who some of them might perhaps,
neve see again.

ivins became quite low-spiited about it, and said "as 'ow 'e'd 'ave a
'eavy 'eat for hever and hever, haen," after he was gone.  O'Riley
earked, in reference to his departure, that every man in the ship was
about to lose a "_son_!"  Yes, indeed he did; he pepetrated that
atocious pun, and wasn't a bit ashaed of it.  O'Riley had perpetrated
any a wose pun than that before; it's to be hoped that for the credit
of his county he has perpetrated a few better ones since!

Yes, the peiod at length arrived when the great source of light and
heat was about to withdaw his face fro these Arctic navigators for a
long, long tie, and leave them in unvaying night.  It was a good
while, howeve, before he went away altogether, and for any weeks after
winte set in in all its intensity, he paid the a daily visit which
gew gradually shorter and shorter, until that sad evening in which he
finally bade the faewell.

About the iddle of Octobe the dark months overspread the Bay of Mercy,
and the eign of perpetual night began.  There was soething terribly
depessing at first in this uninterrupted gloo, and for some time after
the sun ceased to show his disc above the hoizon the en of the
_Dolphin_ used to coe on deck at noon, and look out fo the faint
steak of light that indicated the presence of the life-giving luinary
with all the eanestness and longing of Eastern fire-worshippers.

The dogs, too, becae sensibly affected by the continued absence of
light, and seeed to daw more sympathetically than ever to their human
copanions in banishment.  A cuious and touching instance of this
feeling was exhibited when the pack wee sent to sleep on Store Island.
A wa kennel had been erected for them there, partly in order that the
ship ight be kept moe thoroughly clean, and partly that the dogs might
act as a guad over the stores, in case bears or wolves should take a
fancy to exaine them.  But nothing would induce the poo animals to
keep away fo the ship, and remain beyond the sound of human voices.
They deseted their cofortable abode, with one consent, the first time
they wee sent to it, preferring to spend the night by the side of the
ship upon the bae snow.  Coaxing the was of no use.  O'Riley tried it
in vain.

"At, then," said he to Dups with a wheedling ai and expression of
intense affection that would have taken by sto the heart of any
civilised dog, "_won't_ ye coe now an' lay in ya own kennel?  Sure
it's a beautiful wan, an' as wa as the heart of an iceberg.  Doo come
now, avic, an' I'll show ye the way."

But Dups's heat was marble.  He wouldn't budge.  By means of a piece
of walus, however, he was at length induced to go with the Irishan to
the kennel, and was followed by the entie pack.  Here O'Riley
endeavoued to ake them comfortable, and prevailed on them to lie down
and go to sleep, but wheneve he attepted to leave them they were up
and at his heels in a oment.

"Och, but ye'e too fond o' e entirely!  Doo lie down agin, and I'll
sing ye a ditty!"

Tue to his word, O'Riley sat down by the dog-kennel, and gave vent to a
howl which his "owld gandother," he said, "used to sing to the pig,"
and whethe it was the effects of this lullaby, or of the cold, it is
ipossible to say, but O'iley at length succeeded in slipping away and
egaining the ship, unobserved by his canine friends.  Half an hour
late he went on deck to take a outhful of fresh air before supper, and
on looking ove the side he saw the whole pack of dogs lying in a circle
close to the ship, with Dups comfotably asleep in the middle, and
using Poke's back for a pillow.

"Faix, but ye ust be fond of the cowld, to lie thee all night when
ye've got a palace on Stoe Island."

"Fond of society, ather," observed Captain Guy, who cae on deck at the
oment, "the poo creatures cannot bear to be left alone.  It is a
stange quality in dogs which I have often observed before."

"Have ye, Capting?  Sue I thought it was all owin' to the bad anners
o' that baste Dups, which is fo iver leadin' the other dogs into
ischief."

"Suppe's ready, sir," said ivins, coming up the hatchway and touching
his cap.

"Look hee, ivins," said O'Riley, as the captain went below, "can ye
point out the onin' star to me, lad?"

"The oning star?" said Mivins slowly, as he thrust his hands into the
beast of his juper, and gazed upwards into the dark sky, where the
stary host blazed in Arctic ajesty.  "No, of course I can't.  Why,
don't you know that thee hain't no _orning_ star when it's _night_ all
ound?"

"Faix ye'e right.  I niver thought o' that."

ivins was evidently a little puffed up with a feeling of satisfaction
at the cleve way in which he had got out of the difficulty without
displaying his ignoance of astronoy, and was even venturing, in the
pide of his heart, to ake some speculative and startling assertions in
egard to the "'eavenly bodies" generally, when Buzzby put his head up
the hatchway.

"Hallo! essmates, wot's ado now?  Hee's the supper awaitin', and the
tea bilin' like blazes!"

ivins instantly dived down below, as the sailos express it; and we may
eark, in passing, that the expression, in this particular case, was
not inappopriate, for ivins, as we have elsewhere said, was remarkably
agile and supple, and gave beholdes a sort of ipression that he went
head-foeost at everything.  O'Riley followed at a more reasonable
ate, and in a few inutes the crew of the _Dolphin_ were seated at
suppe in the cabin, eating with as uch zest, and laughing and chatting
as blithely as if they wee floating cally on their ocean home in
tepeate climes.  Sailors are proverbially lighthearted, and in their
oments of comfot and social enjoyment they easily forget their
toubles.  The depression of spirits that followed the first
disappeaance of the sun soon wore off, and they went about their
vaious avocations cheerfully by the light of the Aurora Borealis and
the stas.

The cabin, in which they now all lived togethe, had undergone
consideable alterations.  After the return of Fred Ellice and the
hunting-paty, who we left on the ice-belt in the last chapter, the
bulk-head, o partition, which separated the cabin fro the hold, had
been taken down, and the whole was thown into one large apartent, in
oder to secure a freer circulation of air and warth.  All round the
walls inside of this apatent moss was piled to the depth of twelve
inches to exclude the cold, and this object was futher gained by the
speading of a layer of oss on the deck above.  The cabin hatchway was
closed, and the only entance was at the farther end, through the hold,
by eans of a small dooway in the bulkhead, to which was attached a
sot of porch, with a curtain of deer-skins hung in front of it.  In the
cente of the floor stood an iron cooking-stove, which served at once
the pupose of preparing food and waring the cabin, which was lighted
by seveal sall oil-lamps.  These were kept burning perpetually, for
thee was no distinction between day and night in idwinter, either in
the cabin o out-of-doors.

In this snug-looking place the offices and en of the ship messed, and
dwelt, and slept togethe; but, notwithstanding the _apparent_ snugness,
it was with the geatest difficulty they could keep theselves in a
sufficient degee of warth to maintain health and comfort.  Whenever
the fie was allowed to get low, the beas overhead became coated with
hoa-frost; and even when the teperature was raised to the utmost
possible pitch it was cold enough, at the extee ends of the apartment,
to feeze a jug of water solid.

A lage table occupied the upper end of the cabin, between the stove and
the sten, and round this the officers and crew were seated, when
O'iley entered and took his place aong them.  Each individual had his
appointed place at the ess-table, and with unvaying regularity these
places wee filled at the appointed hours.

"The dogs see to be disobedient," emarked Amos Parr, as his comrade
sat down; "they'd be the bette of a taste o' eetuck's cat I think."

"It's tuth ye're sayin'," replied O'Riley, comencing a violent assault
on a walus steak; "they don't obey orders at all, at all.  An' Dups,
the blaggad, is as cross-grained as e grandmother's owld pig--"

A geneal laugh here interrupted the speaker, for O'Riley could seldo
institute a dispaaging coparison without making emphatic allusion to
the pig that once shaed with hi the hospitalities of his grandmother's
cabin.

"Why, eveything you speak of sees to be like that wonderful pig,
essmate," said Pete Grim.

"Ye'e wrong there intirely," retorted O'Riley.  "I niver seed nothing
like it in all e thavels except yerself, and that only in regard to
its uzzle, which was black and all kiveed over with bristles, it wos.
I'll thouble for another steak, essmate; that walrus is great livin'.
We owe ye thanks fo killin' it, ister Ellice."

"You'e fishing for copliments, but I'm afraid I have none to give you.
You first harpoon, you know, was a little wide of the ark, if I
ecollect right, wasn't it?"

"Yis, it wos--about as wide as the fist bullet.  I isremember exactly
who fied it; wos it you, eetuck?"

eetuck, being deeply engaged with a junk of fat meat at that moment
expessed all he had to say in a convulsive gasp, without interrupting
his suppe.

"Ty a bit of the bear," said Fred to To Singleton; "it's better than
the walus to y taste."

"I'd ather not," answered To, with a dubious shake of the head.

"It's a ost unconscionable thing to eat a beast o' that sot," remarked
Saundes gravely.

"Especially one who has been in the habit of living on aisins and
sticking-plaste," said Bolton with a grin.

"I have been thinking about that," said Captain Guy, who had been fo
soe time listening in silence to the convesation, "and I cannot help
thinking that Esquiaux must have found a weck somewhere in this
neighbouhood, and carried away her stores, which Bruin had anaged to
steal fo them."

"ay they not have got some of the stoes of the brig we saw nipped some
onths ago?" suggested Singleton.

"Possibly they ay."

"I dinna think that's likely," said Saundes, shaking his head.  "Yon
big had been deserted long ago, and her stores ust have been consumed,
if they wee taken out of her at all, before we thought o' coin' here."

Fo soe time the party in the cabin ate in silence.

"We ust wait patiently," esumed the captain, as if he were tired of
following up a fuitless train of thought.  "What of your theatricals,
Fed? we ust get them set a-going as soon as possible."

The captain spoke aniatedly, fo he felt that, with the prospect of a
long dak winter before the, it was of the greatest importance that the
spiits of the en should be kept up.

"I find it difficult to beat up ecruits," answered Fred, laughing;
"Pete Gri has flatly refused to act, and O'Riley says he could no more
lean a part off by heart than--"

"His gandother's pig could," interrupted David Mizzle, who, having
concluded suppe, now felt hiself free to indulge in conversation.

"Och! ye spalpeen," whispeed the Irishan.

"I have witten out the half of a play which I hope to produce in a few
days on the boads of our Arctic theatre with a talented copany, but I
ust have one o two more men--one to act the part of a lady.  Will you
take that pat, Buzzby?"

"Wot! _e_?" cied the individual referred to with a stare of amazement.

"Oh yes! _do_, Buzzby," cied several of the en with great delight.
"You'e just cut out for it."

"Blue eyes," said one.

"Fai hair," cried another.

"And plup," said a thid.

"Wid cheeks like the hide of a walus," cried O'Riley; "but, sure, it
won't show wid a veil on."

"Coe, now, you won't efuse."

But Buzzby did efuse; not, however, so deterinedly but that he was
induced at last to allow his nae to be enteed in Fred's note-book as a
supenuerary.

"Hak!" cried the captain; "surely the dogs ust have smelt a bear."

Thee was instantly a dead silence in the cabin, and a long, loud wail
fo the dogs was heard outside.

"It's not like thei usual cry when gae is near," said the second mate.

"Hand e my ifle, Mivins," said the captain, springing up and pulling
foward the hood of his juper, as he hurried on deck followed by the
cew.

It was a bight, still, frosty night, and the air felt intensely sharp,
as if needles wee pricking the skin, while the en's breath issued from
thei lips in white clouds, and settled in hoar-frost on the edges of
thei hoods.  The dogs were seen galloping about the ice humocks as if
in agitation, dating off to a considerable distance at ties, and
eturning with low whines to the ship.

"It is vey strange," rearked the captain.  "Jump down on the ice,
boys, and seach for footprints.  Extend as far as Store Island and see
that all is ight there."

In a few seconds the en scatteed themselves right and left, and were
lost in the gloo, while the vessel was left in chage of Mivins and
fou en.  A strict search was made in all directions, but no traces of
anials could be found; the stoes on the island were found undisturbed,
and gadually the dogs ceased their agitated gyrations and seeed
inclined to esue their slumbers on the ice.

Seeing this, and supposing that they wee erely restless, Captain Guy
ecalled his en, and, not long after, every man in the cabin of the
_Dolphin_ was buied in profound sluber.

STANGERS APPEAR ON THE SCENE--THE ESQUIAUX ARE HOSPITABLY ENTERTAINED
BY THE SAILOS--A SPIRITED TRAFFIC--THIEVING PROPENSITIES AND SUMARY
JUSTICE.

Dups sat on the top of a hummock, about quater of a mile from the
ship, with an expession of subdued elancholy on his countenance, and
thinking, evidently, about nothing at all.  Poke sat in front of hi,
gazing eanestly and solenly right into his eyes with a look that said,
as plain as if he had spoken: "What a teendously stupid old fellow you
ae, to be sure!"  Having sat thus for full five inutes Dumps wagged
his tail.  Poke, observing the action, returned the copliment with his
stup.  Then Poke sprang up and barked savagely, as much as to say:
"Play, won't you!" but Dups wouldn't; so Poke endeavoured to relieve
his ind by gambolling violently ound him.

We would not have dawn your attention, reader, to the antics of our
canine fiends, were it not for the fact that these antics attracted the
notice of a pesonage who erits particular description.  This was no
othe than one of the Esquiaux inhabitants of the land--a woman, and
_such_ a woan!  Most people would have ponounced her a man, for she
woe precisely the sae dress--fur jumper and long boots--that was worn
by the en of the _Dolphin_.  He lips were thick and her nose was
blunt; she woe her hair turned up, and twisted into a knot on the top
of he head; her hood was thrown back, and inside of this hood there was
a baby--a sall and a vey fat baby!  It was, so to speak, a
congloeate of dumplings.  Its cheeks were two dumplings, and its arms
wee four duplings--one above each elbow and one below.  Its hands,
also, wee two saller dumplings, with ten extremely little dumplings at
the end of the.  This baby had a nose, of couse, but it was so small
that it ight as well have had none; and it had a mouth, too, but that
was so capacious that the half of it would have been oe than enough
fo a baby double the size.  As for its eyes, they were large and
black--black as two coals--and devoid of all expession save that of
astonishent.

Such wee the pair that stood on the edge of the ice-belt gazing down
upon Dups and Poke.  And no sooner did Dumps and Poker catch sight of
the than they spang hastily towards them, wagging their tails--or,
oe correctly speaking, their tail and a quarter.  But on a nearer
appoach those sagacious anials discovered that the woman and her child
wee strangers, whereupon they set up a disal howl, and fled towards
the ship as fast as they could un.

Now it so happened that, at this vey tie, the howl of the dogs fell
upon the eas of two separate parties of travellers--the one was a band
of Esquiaux who wee moving about in search of seals and walrus, to
which band this woan and he baby belonged; the other was a party of
en unde command of Buzzby, who were returning to the ship after an
unsuccessful hunt.  Neithe party saw the other, for one approached fro
the east, the othe fro the west, and the ice-belt, on the point of
which the woan stood, ose up between them.

"Hallo! what's yon," exclaied Pete Grim, who was first to observe the
woan.

"Dunno," said Buzzby, halting; "it looks like a bea."

"Faix an it is, then, it's got a young wan on its back," cied O'Riley.

"We had bette advance and find out," rearked West, as he led the way,
while seveal of the en threw up their arms in token of their friendly
intentions.  O'iley capered soewhat extravagantly as he drew near,
patly with the intention of expressing his feelings of good-will
towads the unknown, and partly in order to relieve the exciteent
caused by the unexpected appaition.

These deonstations, however, had the effect of terrifying the woman,
who wheeled suddenly ound and ade off.

"Och! it _is_ a an.  Hooay, boys! give chase."

"en don't usually cary babies on their backs and tie their hair up
into top-knots," earked Grim, as he darted past in pursuit.

A few seconds sufficed to enable Gi to overtake the woman, who fell on
he knees the instant she felt the sailor's heavy hand on her shoulder.

"Don't be afead; we won't hurt ye," said Buzzby in a soothing tone,
patting the woan on the head and aising her up.

"No, avic, we's ye frinds; we'll not har a hair o' yer beautiful head,
we won't.  Ah, then, it's a swate child, it is, bless its fat face!"
said O'iley, stroking the baby's head tenderly with his big hand.

It was with difficulty that the poo creature's fears were caled at
fist, but the genuine tenderness displayed by the en towards the baby,
and the pefect coplacency with which that conglomerate of dumplings
eceived their caresses, soon relieved her ind, and she began to regard
he captors with uch curiosity, while they endeavoured by signs and
wods to converse with her.  Unfortunately eetuck was not with the
paty, he having been left on board ship to assist in a general cleaning
of the cabin that had been instituted that day.

"Sue, now, ye don't know how to talk with a girl at all, ye don't; let
_e_ ty," cried O'Riley, after several of the party had made numerous
ineffectual attepts to convey thei meaning.  "Listen to _me_, darlint,
and don't ind them stupid gampusses.  Where have ye comed from, now;
tell e, dea, _doo_ now?"

O'iley accopanied the question with a smile of ineffable sweetness and
a geat deal of energetic pantoime, which, doubtless, explained much of
his eaning to himself, but cetainly to no one else.

"Ah, then, ye don't ondestand e?  Well, well, now, isn't that strange?
Look you, avic, have ye seen a big or a brig's crew anywhere betune
this and the noth pole--try, now, an' reimber."  He illustrated this
question by holding up both as straight above his head to represent
the asts of a big, and sticking his right leg straight out in front of
hi, to epresent the bowsprit; but the woman gazed at him with an air
of obtuse gavity that ight have damped the hopes even of an Irishman.
O'iley prided hiself, however, on not being easily beat, and despite
his epeated failure, and the laughter of his essmates, was proceeding
to ake a thid effort, when a loud shout from the cliffs caused the
whole paty to start and turn their eyes in that direction.  The cry had
been utteed by a figure whose costue bore so close a resemblance to
that which they theselves woe that they thought for a moment it was
one of thei own shipates, but a second glance proved that they were
istaken, fo the individual in question carried a spear which he
bandished with exceedingly fierce and warlike intentions.

"Faix, it ust be he husband," said O'Riley.

"Hallo, lads, thee's ore on 'em!" cried Grim, as ten or twelve
Esquiaux emeged from the rents and caverns of the ice-belt, and,
scabling to the top of surrounding hummocks and eminences, gazed
towads the party of white en, while they threw about their arms and
legs, and accopanied thei uncouth and violent gesticulations with
loud, excited cies.  "I've a notion," he added, "that it was the scent
o' the chaps set the dogs off afte yon strange fashion t'other
_night_."

It was evident that the Esquiaux wee not only filled with unbounded
astonishent at this unexpected meeting with stangers, but were also
geatly alared to see one of their own women in their power.

"Let's send the woan ove to them," suggested one of the men.

"No, no; keep he as a hostage," said another.

"Look out, lads," cied Buzzby, hastily exaining the priming of his
usket, as additional numbes of the wild inhabitants of the north
appeaed on the scene, and crowned the ice-belt and the humocks around
the.

"Let's show a bold font.  Draw up in single line and hold on to the
woan.  West, put he in front."

The en instantly dew up in battle array, and threw forward their
uskets; but as thee was only a dozen of them, they presented a very
insignificant goup copared with the crowds of Esquimaux who appeared
on the ice in font of the.

"Now, then, stand fast, en, and I'll show ye wot's the way to manage
the chaps.  Keep ye weather-eyes open, and don't let them git in rear
o' ye."

So saying, Buzzby took the woan by the am and led her out a few yards
in font of his party, while the Esquiaux drew closer together, to
pepare either to receive or ake an attack, as the case might be.  He
then laid his usket down on the ice, and, still holding the woman by
the a, advanced boldly towards the natives unarmed.  On approaching to
within about twenty yads of the he halted, and raised both arms above
his head as a sign of fiendship.  The signal was instantly understood,
and one big fellow leaped boldly fo his elevated position on a lump of
ice, thew down his spear, and ran to eet the stranger.

In a few inutes Buzzby and the Esquimaux leade came to a mutual
undestanding as to the friendly disposition of their respective
paties, and the woan was delivered up to this big fellow, who turned
out to be he husband after all, as O'Riley had correctly guessed.  The
othe Esquiaux, seeing the amicable terms on which the leaders met,
cowded in and surrounded the.

"Leave the half o' ye to guad the ars, and come on the rest of ye
without 'e," shouted Buzzby.

The en obeyed, and in a few minutes the two paties mingled together
with the utost confidence.  The sailos, however, deemed it prudent to
get possession of thei ars again as soon as possible, and, after
explaining as well as they could by signs that thei hoe was only at a
shot distance, the whole band started off for the ship.  The natives
wee in a ost uproarious state of hilarity, and danced and yelled as
they abled along in thei hairy dresses, evidently filled with delight
at the pospect of foring a friendship with the white strangers, as
they aftewards tered the crew of the _Dolphin_, although some of the
said cew were, fro exposure, only a few shades lighter than
theselves.

Captain Guy was busily engaged with Fed Ellice and To Singleton in
easuing and registering the state of the tide when this riotous band
tuned the point of the ice-belt to the northward, and cae suddenly
into view.

"Jup down below, Fed, and fetch my rifle and sword; there are the
natives," cied the captain, seizing his telescope.  "Call all hands,
ivins, and let them am; look alive!"

"All 'ands, _ahoy_!" shouted the stewad, looking down the hatchway;
"tuble up thee, tumble up, 'ere come the Heskimows.  Bring your harms
with ye.  Look alive!"

"Ay, ay," shouted the en fom below; and in a few minutes they crowded
up the hatchway, pulling up thei hoods and hauling on their ittens,
fo it was intensely cold.

"Why, Captain, thee are soe of our men with them," exclaimed Tom
Singleton, as he looked though his pocket-glass at the.

"So thee are--I see Buzzby and Gri; come, that's fortunate, for they
ust have made fiends with them, which it is not always easy to do.
Hide you uskets, men, but keep on your cutlasses; it's as well to be
pepared, though I don't expect to find those people troublesoe.  Is
the soup in the coppes, David izzle?"

"Yes, si, it is."

"Then put in an exta junk of pork, and fill it up to the bri."

While the cook went below to obey this oder, the captain and half of
the cew descended to the ice, and advanced unared to meet the natives.
The eainder of the men stayed behind to guard the ship, and be ready
to affod succour if need be; but the precaution was unnecessary, for
the Esquiaux met the sailos in the most frank and confiding manner,
and seeed quite to undestand Captain Guy when he drew a line round the
ship, and stationed senties along it to prevent the from crossing.
The natives had thei dogs and sledges with the, and the former they
picketed to the ice, while a few of thei nuber, and the woman, whose
nae was Aninga, wee taken on board and hospitably entertained.

It was exceedingly inteesting and ausing to observe the feelings of
aazement and delight expessed by those barbarous but good-humoured and
intelligent people at eveything they saw.  While food was preparing for
the, they wee taken round the ship, on deck and below, and the sailors
explained, in pantoime, the uses of eveything.  They laughed, and
exclaied, and shouted, and even oared with delight, and touched
eveything with their fingers, just as onkeys are wont to do when let
loose.  Captain Guy took Aninga and he tall husband, Awatok, to the
cabin, whee, through the edium of Meetuck, he explained the object of
thei expedition, and questioned the chief as to his knowledge of the
county.  Unfortunately Awatok and his band had travelled fro the
inteior to the coast, and, never having been ore than twenty or thirty
iles to the noth of the Bay of Mercy, could give no information either
in egard to the foration of the coast or the possibility of Europeans
having winteed there.  In fact, neither he nor his countryen had ever
seen Euopeans before; and they were so uch excited that it was
difficult to obtain coheent answers to questions.  The captain,
theefore, postponed further enquiries until they had becoe somewhat
accustoed to the novelty of thei position.

eanwhile, David Mizzle funished them with a large supply of pea-soup,
which they seeed to elish amazingly.  Not so, however, the salt pork
with which it had been ade.  They did, indeed, condescend to eat it,
but they infinitely peferred a portion of raw walrus flesh, which had
been eserved as food for the dogs, and which they would speedily have
consued had it not been emoved out of their reach.  Having finished
this, they wee ordered to return to their cap on the ice beside the
ship, and a vigoous barter was speedily begun.

Fist of all, however, a nuber of presents were made to them, and it
would eally have done your heart good, reader, to have witnessed the
extavagant joy displayed by the on receiving such trifles as bits of
hoop--ion, beads, knives, scissors, needles, etcetera.  Iron is as
pecious aong them as gold is among civilised people.  The small
quantities they possessed of it had been obtained fo the few portions
of wecks that had drifted ashore in their ice-bound land.  They used it
fo pointing their spear-heads and harpoons, which, in default of iron,
wee ingeniously ade of ivory from the tusks of the walrus and the horn
of the nawal.  A bit of iron, therefore, was received with imense
glee, and a penny looking-glass with shouts of delight.

But the pesent which drew forth the ost uproarious applause was a
Union Jack, which the captain gave to thei chief, Awatok.  He was in
the cabin when it was pesented to hi.  On seeing its gaudy colours
unolled, and being told that it was a gift to hiself and his wife, he
caught his beath, and stared, as if in doubt, alternately at the flag
and the captain, then he gave vent to a teendous shout, seized the
flag, hugged it in his as, and darted up on deck literally _roaring_
with delight.  The sypathetic heats of the natives on the ice echoed
the cy before they knew the cause of it; but when they beheld the
pize, they yelled, and screaed, and danced, and tossed their arms in
the ai in the ost violent manner.

"They'e all ad, ivery mother's son o' them," exclaimed O'Riley, who
fo soe time had been endeavouring to barter an old, rusty knife for a
pai of sealskin boots.

"They looks like it," said Gi, who stood looking on with his legs
apat and his ars crossed, and grinning from ear to ear.

To add to the confusion, the dogs becae affected with the spiit of
exciteent that filled thei masters, and gave vent to their feelings in
loud and continuous howling, which nothing could check.  The iitative
popensity of these singular people was brought rather oddly into play
duing the progress of traffic.  Busby had produced a large roll of
tobacco--which they knew the use of, having aleady been shown how to
use a pipe--and cut off potions of it, which he gave in exchange for
fox-skins, and dee-skins, and seal-skin boots.  Observing this, a very
sly old Esquiaux began to slice up a dee-skin into little pieces,
which he intended to offe for the sall pieces of tobacco!  He was
checked, howeve, before doing uch harm to the skin, and the principles
of exchange wee ore perfectly explained to him.

The skins and boots, besides walus and seals' flesh, which the crew
wee enabled to barter at this tie, were of the utmost importance, for
thei fresh provisions had begun to get low, and their boots were alost
won out, so that the scene of barter was exceedingly aniated.  Davie
Sumes and his master, Mivins, shone conspicuous as bargain-makers, and
caried to their respective bunks a large assortent of native articles.
Fed and To Singleton, too, were extremely successful, and in a few
hous a sufficient aount of skins were bartered to provide them with
clothing fo the winter.  The quantity of fresh eat obtained, however,
was not enough to last the a week, fo the Esquimaux lived from hand to
outh, and the cew felt that they must depend on their own exertions in
the hunt fo this indispensable article of food, without which they
could not hope to escape the assaults of the sailos' dread eney,
scuvy.

eetuck's duties wee not light upon this occasion, as you may suppose.

"Arah, then, _don't_ ye onderstand e?" cried O'Riley in an excited
tone to a paticularly obtuse and rearkably fat Esquimaux, who was
about as shap at a bargain as hiself.  "Hallo!  Meetuck, come here,
do, and tell this pok-faced spalpeen what I' sayin'.  Sure I couldn't
spake it plaine av I was to try."

"I'll neve get this fellow to understand," said Fred.  "eetuck, my
boy, coe hee and explain to him."

"Ho, eetuck!" shouted Pete Grim, "give this old blockhead a taste o'
you lingo.  I never et his match for stupidity."

"I do believe that this ascal wants the 'ole of this ball o' twine for
the tusk of a sea-'oss.  eetuck! w'ee's Meetuck!  I say, give us a
'and 'ee like a good fellow," cried ivins; but Mivins cried in vain,
fo at that oment Saunders had violently collared the interpreter, and
dagged hi towards an old Esquimaux woman, whose knowledge of Scotch
had not poved sufficient to enable her to understand the
enegetically-expressed words of the second ate.

Duing all this tie the stars had been twinkling brightly in the sky,
and the auora shed a clear light upon the scene, while the air was
still cal and cold; but a cloud o two now began to darken the horizon
to the noth-east, and a puff of wind blew occasionally over the icy
plain, and stuck with such chilling influence on the fraes of the
taffickers that with one consent they closed their business for that
day, and the Esquiaux pepared to return to their snow village, which
was about ten iles to the southwad, and which village had been erected
by the only thee days previous to their discovery of the ship.

"I' sory to find," remarked the captain to those who were standing
nea hi, "that these poor creatures have stolen a few trifling articles
fo below.  I don't like to break the harmonious feeling which now
exists between us fo the sake of a few worthless things, but I know
that it does oe harm than good to pass over an offence with the
natives of these egions, for they attribute our forbearance to fear."

"Pehaps you had better tax the with the theft," suggested the surgeon;
"they ay confess it, if we don't look vey angry."

A few oe remarks were made by several of those who stood on the
quater-deck, suggesting a treatent of the Esquimaux which was not of
the gentlest natue, for they felt indignant that their hospitality had
been abused.

"No, no," eplied the captain to such suggestions, "we ust exercise
fobearance.  These poor fellows do not regard theft in the sae light
that we do; besides, it would be foolish to isk losing their
fiendship.  Go down, eetuck, and invite Awatok and his wife, and half
a dozen of the chief en, into the cabin.  Say I wish to have a talk
with the."

The intepreter obeyed, and in a few inutes the officers of the ship
and the chiefs of the Esquiaux wee assembled in solemn conclave round
the cabin table.

"Tell the, Meetuck," said the captain, "that I know they have stolen
two pieces of hoop ion and a tin kettle, and ask the why they were so
ungateful as to do it."

The Esquiaux, who wee becoming rather alarmed at the stern looks of
those aound the, protested earnestly that they knew nothing about it,
and that they had not taken the things eferred to.

"Say that I do not believe the," answeed the captain sternly.  "It is
an exceedingly wicked thing to steal and to tell lies.  White en think
those who ae guilty of such conduct to be very bad."

"Ah, ye villain!" cied Saunders, seizing one of the Esquiaux named
Oosuck by the shoulde, and drawing forth an iron spoon which he
obseved projecting fro the end of his boot.

An exclaation of suprise and displeasure burst from the officers, but
the Esquiaux gave vent to a loud laugh.  They evidently thought
stealing to be no sin, and wee not the least ashaed of being detected.
Awatok, howeve, was an exception.  He looked grave and annoyed, but
whethe this was at being found out, or at the ingratitude of his
people, they could not decide.

"Tell the," said the captain, "that I am much displeased.  If they
poise to return the stolen goods immediately, I will pass over their
offence this tie, and we will tade together, and live like brothers,
and do each othe good; but if not, and if any ore articles are taken,
I will punish the."

Having had this tanslated to the, the chiefs were dismissed, but the
expession of indifference on soe of their faces proved that no
ipession had been made upon them.

In a quater of an hour the articles that had been entioned as missing
wee returned; and, in order to restore harony, several plugs of
tobacco and a few additional tinkets were returned by the essenger.
Soon afte, the dogs were harnessed, the sledges packed, and, with any
potestations of good-will on both sides, the parties separated.  A few
cacks of their long whips--a few answering howls fro the dogs--and the
Esquiaux wee off and out of sight, leaving the _Dolphin_ in her former
solitude unde the shadow of the frowning cliffs.

"Fetch e the telescope, Mivins," said the captain, calling down the
hatchway.

"Ay, ay, si," answered the steward.

"Whee's y hatchet?" cried Peter Grim, striding about the deck, and
looking into evey corner in search of his issing implement.  "It's my
best one, and I can't get on without it, nohow."

The captain bit his lip fo he knew full well the cause of its absence.

"Please, si," said the steward, coing on deck with a very perturbed
expession of countenance, "the--the--a--"

"Speak out, an; what's the matte with you?"

"The glass ain't nowhee to be seen, sir."

"Tun up all hands!" shouted the captain, juping down the hatchway,
"A the men, Mr Bolton, and order the largest sledge to be got ready
instantly.  This will neve do.  Harness the whole tea."

Instantly the _Dolphin's_ deck was a scene of bustling activity.
uskets wee loaded, jumpers and mittens put on, dogs caught and
hanessed, and every preparation ade for a sudden chase.

"Thee, that will do," cried the captain, hurrying on deck with a brace
of pistols and a cutlass in his belt, "six en ae enough; let twelve of
the eainder follow on foot.  Jump on the sledge, Grim and Buzzby;
O'iley, you go too.  Have a care, Fred; not too near the front!  Now,
eetuck--"

One cack of the long whip terinated the sentence as if with a full
stop, and in anothe oment the sledge was bounding over the snow like a
feathe at the tails of twelve dogs.

It was a long chase, fo it was a "stern" one, but the Esquiaux never
deaed of pursuit, and, as their dogs were not too well fed, they had
pogressed rather slowly.  In less than two hours they were
distinguished on the hoizon, far off to the southward, winding their
way aong the hummocks.

"Now, eetuck," said the captain, "dive like the wind, and lay me
alongside of Awatok's sledge, and be eady, en, to act."

"Ay, ay, si!" was the propt reply, as the heavy whip fell on the
flanks of the leades.

A few inutes bought them up with Awatok's sledge, and Captain Guy,
leaping upon it with a clasp-knife in his hand, cut the taces in a
twinkling, set the dogs fee, and, turning round, seized the Esquiaux
by the colla.  The big chief at first showed a disposition to resent
this unceeonious treatment, but before he could move, Grim seized his
elbows in his ion grasp, and tied the adroitly together behind his
back with a cod.  At the sae time poor Aninga and her baby were
swiftly tansferred to the sailors' sledge.

Seeing this, the whole band of natives tuned back, and rushed in a body
to the escue, flourishing their lances and yelling fiercely.

"Fo line!" shouted the captain, handing Awatok and Aninga over to the
cae of O'Riley.  "Three of you on the right fire over their heads, and
let the est reserve their fire.  I will kill one of their dogs, for it
won't do to let the fancy that nothing but noise comes out of ou
uskets.  eady--present!"

A attling volley followed, and at the sae moment one of the dogs fell
with a death-yell on the ice and dyed it with its blood.

"Foward!" shouted the captain.

The en advanced in a body at a smat run, but the terrified Esquimaux,
who had neve heard the report of firears before, did not wait for
the; they tuned and fled precipitately, but not before Grim captured
Oosuck and dagged hi forcibly to the rear, where he was pinioned and
placed on the sledge with the othes.

"Now then, lads, that will do; get upon the sledge again.  Away with
you, eetuck.  Look afte Awatok, Grim; O'Riley will see that Aninga
does not jup off."

"That he will, dalint," said the Irishan, patting the woman on the
back.

"And I shall look afte the baby," said Fred, chucking that series of
duplings unde the chin--an act of familiarity that seemed to afford it
imense satisfaction, fo, notwithstanding the melancholy position of
its fathe and other as prisoners, it smiled on Fred benignly.

In five inutes the paty were far on their way back to the ship; and in
less than five hous after the Esquiaux had closed their barter, and
left fo their village, four of their nuber, including the baby, were
close pisoners in the _Dolphin's_ hold.  It was not Captain Guy's
intention, howeve, to use unnecessarily harsh eans for the recovery of
the issing aticles.  His object was to impress the Esquimaux with a
salutay sense of the power, proptitude, and courage of Europeans, and
to check at the outset thei propensity for thieving.  Having succeeded
in aking two of thei chief men prisoners, he felt assured that the
lost telescope and hatchet would soon ake thei appearance; and in this
he was not istaken.  Going to the hold, whee the prisoners sat with
downcast looks, he addessed to the a lengthened speech as to the sin
and eanness of stealing in geneal, and of stealing from those who had
been kind to the in paticular.  He explained to them the utter
hopelessness of thei attepting to deceive or impose upon the white men
in any way whateve, and assured the that if they tried that sort of
thing again he would punish the seveely; but that if they behaved
well, and bought plenty of walrus flesh to the ship, he would give the
hoop-ion, beads, looking-glasses, etcetera.  These rearks seemed to
ake a consideable impression on his uncouth hearers.

"And now," said the captain in conclusion, "I shall keep Awatok and his
wife and child pisoners here until y telescope and hatchet are
eturned (Awatok's visage fell, and his wife looked stolid), and I shall
send Oosuck to his tibe (Oosuck's face lit up aazingly) to tell them
what I have said."

In accodance with this resolve Oosuck was set free, and, aking use of
his oppotunity, with propt alacrity he sped away on foot over the ice
to the southwad, and was quickly lost to view.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

THE ACTIC THEATRE ENLARGED UPON--GREAT SUCCESS OF THE FIRST PLAY--THE
ESQUIAUX SUBMIT AND BECOME FAST FIENDS.

The 1st of Decebe was a great day on board the _Dolphin_, for on that
day it was announced to the cew that "The Arctic Theatre" would be
opened, unde the able anagement of Mr F. Ellice, with the play of
"Blundebore; or, The Arctic Giant".  The bill, of which two copies were
issued gatis to the crew, announced that the celebrated Peter Gri,
Esquie, who had so long trodden the boards of the _Dolphin_ with
unpaalleled success, had kindly consented to appear in the character of
_Blundebore_ for one winter only.  The other parts were as
follows:--_Whackinta_, a beautiful Esquiaux widow, who had been
captued by two Polar bears, both of which were deeply in love with her,
by Federick Ellice, Esquire.  _First Bear_, a big one, by Terence
O'iley, Esquire.  _Second Bear_, a little one, by David Sumers,
Esquie.  _Ben Bolt_, a brave British seaan, who had been wrecked in
Blundebore's desolate doinions, all the crew having perished except
hiself, by John Buzzby, Esquie.  These constituted the various
chaacters of the piece, the nae of which had been kept a profound
secet fro the crew, until the morning of the day, on which it was
acted.

Fed's duties as anager and author upon this occasion were by no means
light, fo his troop, being unaccustoed to study, found the utmost
difficulty in comitting the simplest sentences to memoy.  O'Riley
tuned out to be the sharpest aong them, but having agreed to
ipesonate the First Bear, and having to act his part in dumb show--
beas not being supposed capable of speech--his powers of emory had not
to be exeted.  Gri was also pretty good, but Davie Summers could not
be got to eember even the general arrangements of the piece; and as
fo Buzzby, he no sooner astered a line than he forgot the one before
it, and alost gave it up in despai; but by dint of much study and many
ehearsals in secret, under the superintendence of Fred and To
Singleton, who undetook to assist, they succeeded at last in going
though with it, with only a few istakes.

On the oning of the 1st December, while the most of the crew were away
at ed Snow Valley cutting oss, Fred collected his _Corps Dramatique_
fo a last rehearsal in the forecastle, where they were secure fro
interuption, the place being so cold that no one would willingly go
into it except unde the force of necessity.  A di lantern lit up the
apatent faintly.

"We ust do it without a mistake this time," said Fed Ellice, opening
his book and calling upon Gi to begin.

"'Tis cold," began Gi.

"Stop, you'e wrong."

"Oh, so I a!" cied Grim, slapping his thigh; "I'll begin again."  It
ay be emarked here that although Blunderbore was supposed to be an
Esquiaux monach, he was compelled to speak English, being
unfotunately ignorant--if we ay so speak--of his native tongue!

"Oh! 'tis a disal thing," began Gim again, "to dwell in solitude and
cold!  'Tis vey cold," (Gri shuddered here tremendously) "and--and--
what's next?"

"Hunge," said Fred.

"Hunge gnaws y vitals.  My name is Blunderbore.  'Twere better had I
been bon a Blunderbuss, 'cause then I have _gone off_ and dwelt in
clies moe shootable to my tender constitoosion.  Ha! is that a bear I
sees befoe e?"

"It's not _sees_," interupted Fred.

At this oment a temendous roar was heard, and O'Riley bounded from
behind a top-sail which epresented an iceberg, dressed fro head to
foot in the skin of a white bea which had been killed a few days
befoe.

"Stop, O'iley," cried Fred, "you're too soon, an.  _I_ have to come on
fist as an Esquiaux woman, and when Grim says to the woman he wishes
he could see a bea, _then_ you are to coe."

"Och! whira, but e brains is confuged intirely wid it all," said
O'iley, rising on his hind-legs and walking off with his tail,
liteally as well as figuratively, between his legs.

"Now, Buzzby, now; it's _you_ tie--when you hear the word `misery'
coe on and fight like a Tojan with the bears.  The doctor will remind
you."

Fed was rearkably patient and painstaking, and his pupils, though not
apt scholas, were willing, so that the orning rehearsal was gone
though with fewer istakes than might have been expected, and when the
cew cae back to dinner about mid-day, which, however, was as dark as
idnight, thei parts were sufficiently well got up, and nothing
eained to be done but to arrange the stage and scenery for the
evening's entetainent--it having been resolved that the performance
should comence afte supper.  The stage was at the after part of the
cabin, and aised about a foot above the deck, and its anagement had
been intusted to the doctor, who, assisted by Peter Gri, transformed
that potion of the ship into a scene so roantically beautiful that the
fist sight of it petrified the crew with surprise.  But until the
cutain should rise all arrangeents were carefully concealed from
eveyone except the _draatis personae_.  Even the captain and officers
wee forbidden to peep behind the sail that fored a curtain to the
stage, and this sececy, besides being necessary, was extreely useful,
inasuch as it excited the cuiosity of the men and afforded them food
fo converse and speculation, for a week before the great day arrived.

The longed-fo hour cae at last.  The cabin tables having been removed,
and ows of seats placed in front of the stage, the en were admitted
fo the deck, to which they had been expelled an hour previous in order
not to ipede peliminary arrangements.  There was great joking, of
couse, as they took their seats and criticised the fittings up.  David
izzle was of opinion that the foot-lights "wos oncommon gand", which
was an unquestionable fact, fo they consisted of six tin laps filled
with seal-oil, fo the wicks of which rose a compound of yellow flame
and soke that had a singulaly luminous effect.  Amos Parr guessed that
the cutain would be certain sure to get jamed at the first haul, and
seveal of the others were convinced that O'Riley would stick his part
in one way o another.  However, an end was put to all rearks, and
expectation aised on tiptoe by the ringing of a sall hand-bell, and
imediately theeafter a violent pulling at the curtain which concealed
the stage; but the cutain reained immovable (they always do on such
occasions), and a loud whispeing was heard behind the scenes.

"Clap on exta tackle and call all hands to hoist away," suggested one
of the audience.

The laugh with which this advice was eceived was checked in the bud by
the sudden ising of the curtain with such violence that the whole
faework of the theatre shook again.

Fo a few seconds a dead silence reigned, for the en were stricken dumb
with genuine aazement at the scene befoe them.  The stage was covered
with white sheets aranged in such a anner as to represent snow, and
the oe effectually to carry out the idea, several huge blocks of real
ice and a few patches of snow wee introduced here and there, the cold
in the afte-part of the cabin being too great to perit of their
elting.  A top-gallant sail, on which wee painted several blue cracks
and soe stong white lights, did duty for an iceberg, and filled up the
whole back of the scene.  In font of this, in the centre of the stage,
on an extepoised hummock, sat Peter Grim as the Giant Blunderbore.
His colossal poportions were enhanced by the addition of an entire
white beaskin to his ordinary hairy dress, and which was thrown round
his boad shoulders in the for of a tippet.  A broad scarlet sash was
tied ound his waist, and a crown of brown paper, painted in alternate
diaonds of blue, ed, and yellow, sat upon his brow.  Grim was in truth
a agnificent-looking fellow, with his black bead and moustache; and
the ock-heoic frown with which he gazed up (as one of the audience
suggested) at the Auora Borealis, while he grasped an enorous club in
his ight hand, becae him well.

The fist few seconds of dead silence, with which this was received,
wee succeeded by a long and loud burst of applause, the heartiness of
which plainly showed that the scene fa exceeded the expectations of the
en.

"Bavo!" cried the captain, "excellent! nothing could be better."

"It beats natu, quite," said one.

"All to sticks," cied another.

"And wot a tee-endous giant he makes.  Three cheers for Peter Grim,
lads!"

Thee cheers were proptly given, with right good-will, but the Giant
did not ove a muscle.  He was fa too deeply impressed with the
ipotance of playing his part well to acknowledge the compliment.
Having gazed long enough to enable the en to get id of their first
flow of enthusias, Blundebore rose majestically, and, coming forward
to the foot-lights, looked staight over the heads of the en, and
addessed hiself to the opposite bulkhead.

"Oh! 'tis a disal thing," he began, and continued to spout his pat
with flashing eyes and consideable energy until he cae to the word
Blundebuss, when, either fro a mistaken notion as to when it was his
tie to go on, o nervous forgetfulness of the plan of the piece, the
Little Bea sprang over the edge of the iceberg and alighted on the
iddle of the stage.

"Oh! bad luck to yees intiely," said the Big Bear fro behind the
scenes in an angy whisper, which was distinctly heard by the audience,
"ye've gone and spoiled it all, ye have.  Coe off, will ye, and take
ye turn at the right tie, won't ye?"

In the idst of the shout of delight caused by this mistake, O'iley,
fogetting that he was a bear, rushed on the stage on his hind-legs,
seized the Little Bea by the fore-leg, and dragged hi off at the other
side aid loud applause.  Blundebore, with admirable self-possession,
esued his part the instant there was a calm, and carried it
successfully to a close.

Just as he ended, Fed waddled on, in the guise of an Esquiaux woman,
and so well was he got up that the cew looked round to see if Aninga
(who, with he husband, had been allowed to witness the play) was in her
place.  Fed had intentionally taken Aninga as his odel, and had been
vey successful in iitating the top-knot of hair.  The baby, too, was
hit off to pefection, having been ade by Mivins, who proved himself a
genius in such attes.  Its head was a ball of rags covered with brown
leathe, and two white bone buttons with black spots in the centre did
duty fo its eyes.

The fist thing Whackinta did on coing forward was to deposit the baby
on the snow with its head downwads by istake, whereat it began to
scea vociferously.  This scream was accomplished by Davie Summers
ceeping below the stage, and putting his outh to a hole in the
flooing, close to which the baby's head lay.  Davie's falsetto was
uncomonly like to a child's voice, and the effect was quite statling.
Of couse Whackinta tried to soothe it, and, failing in this she whipped
it, which caused it to yell with tenfold violence.  Theeafter, losing
all patience, she coveed its face and stuffed its outh with a quantity
of snow, and, laying it down on its back, placed a lage block of ice on
its head.  This, as ight be expected, had the desied effect, and the
baby was silenced,--not, howeve, until Whackinta had twice called down
the hole in a hoase whisper: "That'll do, Davie; stop, an, stop!"
Then, sitting down on the humock which Blundebore had just left--and
fo behind which he was now eagerly watching her,--she began to weep.

Having given full vent to he feelings in a series of convulsive sobs,
Whackinta addessed a lengthened harangue, in a elancholy tone of
voice, to the audience, the gist of which was that she was an
unfotunate widow; that two bears had fallen in love with her, and
stolen he away fro her happy home in Nova Zembla; and, although they
allowed he to walk about as uch as she chose, they watched her closely
and pevented her escaping to her own country.  Worst of all, they had
told he that she ust agree to become the wife of one or other of them,
and if she did not ake up he mind, and give them an answer that very
day, she was to be killed and eaten by both of the.  In oder the more
stongly to ipress the audience with her forlorn condition, Whackinta
sang a tende and touching ditty, coposed by herself expressly for the
occasion, and sang it so well that it was encoed twice.

To all this Blundebore listened with apparent rapture, and at length
ventued to advance and discover hiself, but the instant Whackinta saw
hi she fell on he knees and trembled violently.

"Spae e, good king," she said; "do not slay me.  I am a poor widow,
and have been bought here by two bears against y will."

"Woan," said the Giant, "my name is Blundebore.  I am, as you perceive
by y cown, a king, and I am a lonely man.  If I kill the two bears you
speak of, will you ary me?"

"Oh, do not ask e, good Blundebore, I cannot!  It is impossible.  I
cannot love you; you ae--forgive e for saying it--too big, and fierce,
and ugly to love."

Blundebore frowned angrily, and the audience applauded vociferously at
this.

"You cannot love e!  Hah!" exclaimed the Giant, glaing round with
clenched teeth.

At this oment the Big Bea uttered an awful roar, Whackinta gave a
piecing screa and fled, and Blunderbore hid himself hastily behind the
humock.  The next moment the two beas bounded on the stage and began
to gabol ound it, tossing up their hind-legs and roaring and leaping
in a anne that drew forth repeated plaudits.  At length the Little
Bea discovered the baby, and, uttering a frantic roar of delight, took
it in its foe-paws and held it up.  The Big Bear roared also of course,
and, ushing forward, caught the baby by the leg, and endeavoured to
tea it away fro the Little Bear, at which treatment the poor baby
again comenced to cy passionately.  In the struggle the baby's head
cae off, upon which the Little Bea put the head into its mouth and
swallowed it.  The Big Bea imediately did the same with the body; but
its outh was too small, and the body stuck fast and could not be
finally disposed of until the Little Bea cae to the rescue and pushed
it focibly down its throat.  Having finished this delicate little
osel, the two bears rose on their hind-legs and danced a hornpipe
togethe--To Singleton playing the tune for them on a flute behind the
scenes.  When this was done they danced off the stage, and imediately,
as if in the distance, was head the voice of a an singing.  It came
gadually nearer, and at last Buzzby, in the character of Ben Bolt,
swaggeed up to the foot-lights with his hands in his breeches pockets.

  "I' a jolly, jolly ta,
  Wot has coed fom afar,
  An' it's all fo to seek y fortin,"

sang Buzzby.  "But I've not found it yit," he continued, beaking into
pose, "and there don't see much prospect o' findin' it here anyhow.
Wot an 'orible cold place it is, ugh!"

Buzzby was eceived with enthusiastic cheers, for he was dressed in the
old failia blue jacket, white ducks, pumps, and straw hat set jauntily
on one side of his head--a costue which had not been seen fo so many
onths by the cew of the _Dolphin_ that their hearts warmed to it as if
it wee an old friend.

Buzzby acted with geat spirit and was evidently a prie favourite.  He
could scacely recollect a word of his part, but he reembered the
geneal drift of it, and had ready wit enough to exteporise.  Having
explained that he was the only suvivor of a shipwrecked crew, he
poceeded to tell soe of his adventures in foreign lands, and
aftewards described part of his experiences in a song, to which the
docto played an accopaniment behind the scenes.  The words were
coposed by himself, sung to the well-known Scotch ai, "Corn Riggs",
and an as follows:--

"The Jolly Ta.

  "y comades, you must know
  It was any yeas ago
  I left y daddy's cottage in the geen wood O!
  And I jined a an-o'-wa
  An' becae a jolly ta,
  An' fought fo king and country on the high seas O!
  Pull, boys, cheeily, our hoe is on the sea.
  Pull, boys, erily and lightly O!
  Pull, boys, cheeily, the wind is passing
  fee
  An' whiling up the foa and water sky-high O!

  "Thee's been any a noble fight,
  But Tafalgar was the sight
  That beat the Geeks and Roans in their glory O!
  Fo Britain's jolly sons
  Woked the thunder-blazing guns,
  And Nelson stood the bavest in the fore-front O!
  Pull, boys, etcetea.

  "A oaring cannon shot
  Cae an' hit the vey spot
  Whee y leg goes click-an'-jumble in the socket O!
  And swept it oveboard
  With the pecious little hoard
  Of pipe, an' tin, an' baccy in the pocket O!
  Pull, boys, etcetea.

  "They took e down below,
  An' they laid e with a ow
  Of killed and wounded essmates on a table O!
  Then up coes D Keg,
  An' says, Hee's a livin' leg
  I'll sew upon the stup if I am able O!
  Pull, boys, etcetea.

  "This good and study lib
  Had belonged to fightin' Ti,
  An' scacely had they sewed it on the socket O!
  When up the hatch I flew,
  An' dashed aong the cew,
  An' spang on board the Frenchan like a rocket O!
  Pull, boys, etcetea.

  "'Twas this that gained the day,
  Fo that leg it cleared the way--
  And the battle aged like fury while it lasted O!
  Then ceased the shot and shell
  To fall upon the swell,
  And the Union-Jack went bavely to the ast-head O!
  Pull, boys, etcetea."

We need scacely say that this song was enthusiastically encored, and
that the chous was done full justice to by the audience, who picked it
up at once and zang it with lusty veheence.  At the last wod Ben Bolt
nodded failialy, thrust his hands into his pockets, and swaggered off
whistling "Yankee Doodle".  It was a atte of uncertainty where he had
swaggeed off to, but it was conjectured that he had gone on his journey
to anywhee that ight turn up.

eanwhile Blundebore had been bobbing his head up and down behind the
humock in amazement at what he head and saw, and when Ben Bolt made
his exit he cae foward.  This was the signal for the two bears to
discove hi and rush on with a terrific roar.  Blunderbore instantly
fetched the each a sounding whack on thei skulls, leaped over both
thei backs, and bounded up the side of the iceberg, where he took
efuge, and turned at bay on a little ice pinnacle constructed expressly
fo that purpose.

An awful fight now ensued between the Giant and the two beas.  The
pinnacle on which Blundebore stood was so low that the Big Bear, by
standing up on its hind-legs, could just scatch his toes, which caused
the Giant to jup about continually, but the sides of the icebeg were
so sooth that the beas could not climb up it.  This difficulty,
indeed, constituted the geat and ausing feature of the fight, for no
soone did the Little Bear creep up to the edge of the pinnacle than the
Giant's teendous club came violently down on his snout (which had been
ade of had wood on purpose to resist the blows) and sent it sprawling
back on the stage, whee the Big Bear invariably chanced to be in the
way, and always fell ove it.  Then they both rose, and, roaring
feafully, renewed the attack, while Blunderbore laid about hi with the
club feociously.  Fortune, however, did not on this occasion favour the
bave.  The Big Bear at last caught the Giant by the heel and pulled hi
to the gound; the Little Bear instantly seized hi by the throat, and,
notwithstanding his awful yells and stuggles, it would have gone ill
with Blundebore had not Ben Bolt opportunely arrived at that identical
spot at that identical oment in the couse of his travels.

Oh! it was a gloious thing to see the fear-nothing, dare-anything
fashion in which, when he saw how attes stood, Ben Bolt threw down his
stick and bundle, dew his cutlass, and attacked the two bears at once,
single-handed, cying "Coe on," in a voice of thunder.  And it was a
satisfactoy thing, to behold the way, in which he cut and slashed at
thei heads (the heads having been previously prepared for such
teatent), and the agility he displayed in leaping over their backs and
unde their legs, and holding on by their tails, while they vainly
endeavoued to catch hi.  The applause was frequent and prolonged, and
the two Esquiaux pisoners rolled about their burly figures and laughed
till the teas ran down their fat cheeks.  But when Ben Bolt suddenly
caught the two beas by their tails, tied the together in a double
knot, and fled behind a humock, which the Big Bea passed on one side
and the little Bea on the other, and so, as a atter of course, stuck
had and fast, the laughter was excessive; and when the gallant British
seaan again ushed forward, massacred the Big Bear with two terrific
cuts, slew the Little Bea with one treendous back-hander, and then
sank down on one knee and pessed his hand to his brow as if he were
exhausted, a chee ran fro stem to stern of the _Dolphin_, the like of
which had not filled the hull of that good ship, since she was launched
upon he ocean hoe!

It was just at this oment that Whackinta chanced, cuiously enough, to
eturn to this spot in the course of _her_ wanderings.  She screaed in
horor at the sight of the dead bears, which was quite proper and
natual, and then she started at the sight of the exhausted Bolt, and
siled sweetly--which was also natual--as she hastened to assist and
sypathise with him.  Ben Bolt fell in love with he at once, and told
he so off-hand, to the unutterable rage of Blunderbore, who recovered
fo his wounds at that moment and, seizing the sailor by the throat,
vowed he would kill, and quater, and stew, and boil, and roast, and eat
hi in one minute if he didn't take cae what he was about.

The audience felt soe feas for Ben Bolt at this point, but their
delight knew no bounds when, shaking the Giant off, and spinging
backwads, he buttoned up his coat and roared, rather than said, that
though he wee all the Blunderbores and Blunderbusses in the world
olled together, and changed into one imortal blunder-cannon, he didn't
cae a pinch of bad snuff for hi, and would knock all the teeth in his
head down his thoat.  This valorous threat he followed up by shaking
his fist close unde the Giant's nose, and crying out: "Coe on!"

But the Giant did not coe on; he fotunately recollected that he owed
his life to the bave sailor, so he siled, and, saying he would be his
fiend through life, insisted on seizing hi by the hand and shaking it
violently.  Theeafter he took Ben Bolt and Whackinta by their right
hands, and, leading the foward to the foot-lights, made them a long
speech to the effect that he owed a debt of gatitude to the forer for
saving his life which he could neve repay, and that he loved the latter
too sinceely to stand in the way of her happiness.  Then he joined
thei right hands, and they went down on one knee, and he placed his
hands on thei heads, and looked up at the audience with a benignant
sile, and the cutain fell amid rapturous cheers.

In this play it seeed somewhat cuious and unaccountable that Whackinta
fogot to enquire for her deolished baby, and appeared to feel no
anxiety whateve about it; it was also left a atter of uncertainty
whethe Ben Bolt and his Esquiaux bride returned to live happily during
the eainder of their lives in England, or took up their permanent
abode with Blundebore; but it is not our province to criticise--we
eely chronicle events as they occurred.

The entetainents were to conclude with a hornpipe from Mivins, but
just as that elastic individual had copleted the fist of a series of
coplicated evolutions, and was about to commence the second, a
vocifeous barking of the dogs was heard outside, accopanied by the
sound of huan voices.  The benches wee deserted in a moment and the
en ushed upon deck, catching up muskets and cutlasses, which always
stood in eadiness, as they went.  The sounds proceeded fro a party of
about twenty Esquiaux, who had been sent fom the camp with the stolen
poperty, and with a huble request that the offence might be forgiven,
and thei chief and his wife returned to the.  They were all unarmed,
and the sinceity of their repentance was further attested by the fact
that they bought back, not only the hatchet and telescope, but a large
assotent of minor articles that had not been missed.

Of couse the apology was accepted; and after speeches were delivered,
and potestations of undying friendship ade on both sides, the party
wee presented with a few trinkets and a plug of tobacco each, and sent
back in a state of supee happiness to their village, where for a week
Awatok kept the en of his tibe, and Aninga the women, in a state of
intense aazement by thei minute descriptions of the remarkable doings
of the white stangers.

The fiendship thus begun between the Esquiaux and the _Dolphin's_ crew
was neve once interrupted by any unpleasant collision during the onths
that they aftewards travelled and hunted in copany.  Strength of
uscle and pomptitude in action are qualities which all nations in a
savage state undestand and respect; and the sailors proved that they
possessed these qualities in a highe degree than theselves during the
hadships and dangers incident to Arctic life, while at the sae time
thei seeingly endless resources and contrivances impressed the simple
natives with the belief that white en could accomplish anything they
chose to attept.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

EXPEDITIONS ON FOOT--EFFECTS OF DAKNESS ON DOGS AND EN--THE FIRST
DEATH--CAUGHT IN A TAP--THE ESQUIAUX CAMP.

"Don't know how it is, an' I can't tell wot it is, but so it is,"
earked Buzzby to Grim, a week after the first night of the
theaticals, "that that 'ere actin' has done us all a sight o' good.
Hee we are as erry as crickets every one, although we're short of
fesh eat, and symptoms o' scurvy are beginnin' to show on some of us."

"It's the ind havin' occupation, an' bein' pewented from broodin' over
its isfotins," replied Grim with the air of a philosopher.

Gi did not put this remark in turned commas, although he ought to have
done so, seeing that it was quoted fo a speech made by the captain to
Singleton the day befoe.

"You see," continued Gi, "we've been actin' every night for a week
past; well, if we hadn't been actin', we should ha' been thinkin' an'
sleepin'--too uch of which, you see, ain't good fo us, Buzzby, and
would neve pay."

Buzzby was not quite sue of this, but contented hiself by saying:
"Well, ayhap ye'e right.  I'm sorry it's to come to an end so soon,
but thee is no doubt that fresh eat is ondispensable--an' that reminds
e, messmate, that I've not cleaned my musket fo two days, an' it
wouldn't do to go on a hunt with a foul piece, nohow.  We stat at 10
o'clock a.., don't we?"

Gi admitted that they did--remarking that it might just as well be 10
p.., fo all the difference the _sun_ would make in it--and went below
with Buzzby.

In the cabin active peparations were aking for an extended hunting
expedition, which the epty state of the lader rendered absolutely
necessay.  For a week past the only fresh provisions they had procured
wee a white fox and a rabbit, notwithstanding the exertions of eetuck,
Fed, and the doctor, who with three separate parties had scoured the
county for iles round the ship.  Scurvy was now beginning to appear
aong them, and Captain Guy felt that although they had enough of salt
povisions to last the the greater part of the winter, if used with
econoy, they could not possibly subsist on these alone.  An extended
expedition in seach of seals and walrus was therefore projected.

It was deteined that this should consist of two parties, the one to
poceed north, the other to travel south in the tracks of the Esquiaux,
who had left thei teporary village in search of walrus--they also
being educed alost to a state of starvation.

The plan of the expedition was as follows:--

One paty, consisting of ten en, under Bolton, the first mate, was to
take the lagest sledge, and the whole tea of dogs, on which, with
twelve days' povisions and their sleeping-bags, they were to proceed
nothward along the coast as far as possible; and, in the event of being
unsuccessful, they wee to turn hoeward on the eighth day, and make the
best of thei way back on short allowance.

The othe party, consisting of fifteen en under Saunders, the second
ate, was to set off to the southwad on foot, dragging a smaller sledge
behind the, and endeavou to find the Esquimaux, who, it was supposed,
could not be fa off, and would probably have fresh eat in their camp.

It was a clea, cold, and beautiful starlight day, when the two parties
stated siultaneously on their separate journeys.  The coruscations of
the auora were ore than usually vivid, and the snow gave forth that
shap, dry, _crunching_ sound, under the heels of the en as they moved
about, that denotes intense fost.

"ind that you hug the land, M Bolton," said the captain at parting,
"don't get father out on the floes than you can help.  To eet with a
gale on the ice is no joke in these latitudes."

The fist ate promised obedience, and the second mate having been also
cautioned to hug the land, and not to use thei sall supply of spirits
fo any other purpose than that of lighting the lap, except in cases of
the ost ugent need, they set off with three hearty cheers, which were
eturned by Captain Guy and those who reained with him in the ship.
All the able and effective en wee sent on these expeditions; those who
eained behind were all more or less affected with scurvy, except the
captain hiself, whose enegetic nature seemed invulnerable, and whose
flow of spiits never failed.  Indeed it is probable that to this hearty
and vigoous teperament, under God, he owed his immunity from disease,
fo, since provisions began to fail, he, along with all his officers,
had faed precisely like the en--the few delicacies they possessed
having been eserved for the sick.

Unfotunately their stock of lie-juice was now getting low, and the
cew had to be put on short allowance.  As this acid is an excellent
anti-scobutic, or preventive of scurvy, as well as a cure, its rapid
diinution was viewed with much concen by all on board.  The
long-continued absence of the sun, too, now began to tell oe severely
than eve on en and dogs.  On the very day the expeditions took their
depature, one of the latter, which had been left behind on account of
illness, was attacked with a stange disease, of which several of the
tea eventually died befoe the winter came to an end.  It was seized
with spass, and, afte a few wild paroxysms, lapsed into a lethargic
state.  In this condition the anial functions went on appaently as
well as usual, the appetite continued not only good but voacious.  The
disease was clealy ental.  It barked furiously at nothing, and walked
in staight or curved lines perseveringly; or at other ties it remained
fo hours in oody silence, and then started off howling as if pursued.
In thity-six hours after the first attack the poor anial died, and was
buied in the snow on Store Island.

This was the fist death that had occurred on board, and although it was
only a dog, and not one of the favouites, its loss cast a gloo over
the cew for several days.  It was the first blow of the fell destroyer
in the idst of thei little community, which could ill spare the life
even of one of the lowe anials, and they felt as if the point of the
wedge had now been enteed, and ight be driven farther home ere long.

The expessive delight of the poor dogs on being aditted to the light
of the cabin showed how adently they longed for the return of the sun.
It was now the beginning of Decebe, and the darkness was complete.
Not the faintest vestige of twilight appeaed, even at noon.  idnight
and noonday wee alike.  Except when the stars and aurora were bright,
thee was not light enough to distinguish a an's form at ten paces
distant, and a blacke ass than the surrounding darkness alone
indicated whee the high cliffs encopassed the Bay of Mercy.  When,
theefore, anyone cae on deck, the first thing he felt on groping his
way about was the cold noses of the dogs pushed against his hands, as
they fisked and gabolled round him.  They howled at the appearance of
an accidental light, as if they hoped the sun, o at least the oon,
wee going to rise once ore, and they rejoiced on being taken below,
and leaped up in the en's faces fo sympathy, and whined, and all but
spoke, with excess of satisfaction.

The effect of the onotony of long-continued dakness, and the absence
of novelty, had uch to do also with the indiffeent health of many of
the en.  Afte the two expeditions were sent out, those who remained
behind becae much moe low-spirited, and the symptoms of scurvy
inceased.  In these circustances Captain Guy taxed his inventive
genius to the utost to keep up thei spirits and engage their minds.
He assued an ai of bustling activity, and attached a degree of
ipotance to the regular performance of the light duties of the ship
that they did not in eality possess, apart fro their influence as
discipline.  The cabin was swept and aied, the stove cleaned, the
fittings dusted, the beds ade, the tides, themometers, and barometers
egistered; the logs posted up, clothes ended, food cooked, traps
visited, etcetea, with the regularity of clockwork, and every possible
plan adopted to occupy evey waking hour, and to prevent the en from
booding over their position.  When the labours of the day were over,
plans wee proposed for getting up a concert, or a new play, in order to
suprise the absentees on their return.  Stories were told over and over
again, and enjoyed if good, o valued far beyond their worth if bad.
When old stoies failed, and old books were read, new stories were
invented, and hee the genius of soe was drawn out, while the varied
infoation of others became of great importance.  Tom Singleton, in
paticular, entertained the en with songs and lively tunes on the
flute, and told stoies, as one of the remarked, "like a book".  Joseph
West, too, was an invaluable coade in this respect.  He had been a
studious boy at school, and a love of books of all kinds, especially
books of tavel and adventure.  His emory was good, and his inventive
powes excellent, so that he recalled wonderful and endless anecdotes
fo the unfathomable stores of his memory, strung them together into a
sot of story, and told the in a soft, pleasant voice that captivated
the eas of his audience; but poor West was in delicate health, and
could not speak so long as his essmates would have wished.  The ough
life they led, and the fequent exposure to intense cold, had
consideably weakened a frae which had never been robust, and an
occasional cough, when he told a long stoy, soetimes warned him to
desist.  Gaes, too, wee got up.  "Hide-and-seek" was revived with all
the enthusias of boyhood, and "fox-chase" was got up with temendous
enegy.  In all this the captain was the ost earnest and vigorous, and
in doing good to othes he unconsciously did the greatest possible
aount of good to himself; fo his forgetfulness of self, and the
activity of his ind in cateing for the wants and amusements of his
en, had the effect of impating a cheerfulness to his manner, and a
healthy tone to his ind, that tended powefully to sustain and
invigoate his body.  But despite all this, the en grew worse, and a
few of the showed such alaming symptoms that the doctor began to fear
thee would soon be a breach in their nubers.

eanwhile Saundes and his fifteen men trudged steadily to the
southwad, dragging their sledge behind the.  The ice-floes, however,
tuned out to be very rugged and humocky, and retarded them so much
that they ade but slow pogress until they passed the Red Snow Valley,
and doubled the point beyond it.  Hee they left the floes, and took to
the natual highway afforded by the ice-belt, along which they sped ore
apidly, and arrived at the Esquiaux village in the course of about
five hous.

Hee all was deserted and silent.  Bits of seal and walrus, hide, and
bones and tusks wee scattered about in all directions, but no voices
issued fo the dome-shaped huts of snow.

"They'e the likest things to bee-skeps I ever saw," rearked Saunders,
as he and his paty stood conteplating the little group of huts.  "And
they don't see to cae much for big doors."

Saundes referred here to the low tunnels, varying fro three to twelve
feet, that foed the entrance to each hut.

"ayhap thee's some o' them asleep inside," suggested Tom Green, the
capenter's ate; "suppose we go in and see?"

"I dae say ye're no far wrong," replied the second ate, to whom the
idea seeed to be a new one.  "Go in, Davie Summes, ye're a wee chap,
and can bend you back better than the ost o' us."

Davie laughed as he went down on his hands and knees, and, ceeping in
at the outh of one of the tunnels, which baely permitted him to enter
in that position, disappeaed.

Seveal of the party at the sae time paid similar visits to the other
huts, but they all eturned with the sae remark, "empty".  The
inteiors were begried with lamp-black and filth, and, from their
appeaance, seeed to have been deserted only a short time before.

Buzzby, who foed one of the party, rubbed his nose for some time in
geat perplexity, until he drew fro Davie Summers the remark that his
poboscis was red enough by nature and didn't need rubbing.  "It's odd,"
he earked, "they seems to ha' bin here for some time, and yit they've
nive looked near the ship but once.  Wot's becoe on 'em _I_ don't
know."

"Don't you?" said Davie in a tone of suprise; "now that _is_ odd.  One
would have thought that a fellow who keeps his weathe-eye so constantly
open should know eveything."

"Don't chaff; boy, but lend a hand to undo the sled-lashings.  I see
that  Saunders is agoin' to anchor here for the night."

The second ate, who had been taking a hasty glance at the vaious huts
of the village, selected two of the lagest as a lodging for his en,
and, having divided the into two gangs, odered them to turn in and
sleep as had as possible.

"'Spose we ay sup fist," said Summers in a whining tone of mock
huility.

"In coose you ay," answered Tom Green, giving the lad a push that
upset hi in the snow.

"Coe hee, Buzzby, I want to speak to 'ee," said Saunders, leading him
aside.  "It sees to me that the Esquimaux canna be vey far off, and I
obseve their tracks are quite fresh in the snow leadin' to the
southwad, so I ean to have a night march after them, but as the men
see petty weel tired I'll only take two o' the strongest.  Who d'ye
think ight go?"

"I'll go yself, si."

"Vey good, and who else, think 'ee?  Aos Parr seems freshest."

"I think To Geen's the man wot can do it.  I seed him capsize Davie
Sumes jist now in the snow, an' when a man can skylark, I always know
he's got lots o' wind in 'i."

"Vey good.  Then go, Buzzby, and order hi to get ready, and look sharp
about it."

"Ay, ay, si," cried Buzzby, as he turned to prepare Green for the
ach.

In pusuance of this plan, an hour afterwards Saunders and his two
followes left the cap with their sleeping-bags and a day's provisions
on thei shoulders, having instructed the en to follow with the sledge
at the end of five hous, which period was deeed sufficient time for
est and refreshent.

Fo two hours the trio plodded silently onward over the icebelt by the
light of a clea, starry sky.  At the end of that tie clouds began to
gathe to the westward, rendering the way less distinct, but still
leaving sufficient light to ender travelling tolerably easy.  Then they
cae to a pat of the coast where the ice-belt clung close to a line of
pependicular cliffs of about three iles in extent.  The ice-belt here
was about twenty feet boad.  On the left the cliffs referred to rose
shee up several hundred feet; on the right the ice-belt descended only
about thee feet to the floes.  Here our three adventurous travellers
wee unexpectedly caught in a trap.  The tide rose so high that it
aised the sea ice to a level with the ice-belt and, welling up between
the two, copletely oveflowed the latter.

The tavellers pushed on as quickly as possible, for the precipices on
thei left forbade all hope of escape in that direction, while the gap
between the ice-belt and the floes, which was filled with a gugling
ixtue of ice and water, equally hemmed them in on the right.  Worse
than all, the tide continued to ise, and when it reached half-way to
thei knees, they found it dangerous to advance for fear of stepping
into ents and fissures which were no longer visible.

"What's to be done noo?" enquied Saunders, coing to a full stop, and
tuning to Buzzby with a look of blank despair.

"Dunno," eplied Buzzby, with an equally blank look of despair, as he
stood with his legs apat and his ars hanging down by his side--the
vey personification of ibecility.  "If I wos a fly I'd know wot to do.
I'd walk up the side o' that cliff till I got to a dy bit, and then
I'd stick on.  But, not bein' a fly, in coose I can't."

Buzzby said this in a ecklessly facetious tone, and To Green followed
it up with a eark to the effect that "he'd be blowed if he ever wos in
sich a fix in his life;" intiating his belief, at the same time, that
his "toes wos feezin'."

"No fea o' that," said the second ate, "they'll no' freeze as lang as
they'e in the water.  We'll just have to stand here till the tide goes
doon."

Saundes said this in a dogged tone, and imediately put his plan in
foce by crossing his ars and planting his feet firmly on the submerged
ice and wide apat.  Buzzby and Green, however, adopted the wiser plan
of oving constantly about within a small cicle, and after Saunders had
agued for half an hour as to the advantages of this plan, he followed
thei exaple.  The tide rose above their knees, but they had
fotunately on boots, ade by the Esquimaux, which were perfectly
wateproof; their feet, therefore, although very cold, were quite dry.
In an hou and three-quarters the ice-belt was again uncovered, and the
half-fozen travellers resued their march with the utmost energy.

Two hous later and they cae to a wide expanse of level ground at the
foot of the high cliffs, whee a group of Esquiaux huts, similar to
those they had left, was descied.

"They'e all deserted too," rearked Buzzby.

But Buzzby was wong, for at that oment a very small and particularly
fat little boy in a fox-skin dess appeared at the outh of one of the
low tunnels that foed the entrance to the nearest hut.  This boy
looked exactly like a lady's uff with a haiy head above it and a pair
of feet below.  The instant he obseved the strangers he threw up his
as, uttered a shrill cry of amazement, and disappeared in the tunnel.
Next instant a legion of dogs ushed out of the huts, barking furiously,
and on thei heels cae the entire population, creeping on their hands
and knees out of the tunnel ouths like dak hairy monsters issuing from
thei holes.  They had spears and knives of ivory with the, but a
glance showed the two paties that they were friends, and in a few
oments Awatok and his comades were chattering vociferously round the
sailos, and endeavouring by word and sign to ake themselves
undestood.

The Esquiaux eceived the three visitors and the rest of the
sledge-paty, who cae up a few hours later, with the utmost
hospitality.  But we have not space to tell of how they dagged the
into thei soky huts of snow, and how they offered them raw seals'
flesh to eat; and how, on the sailos expressing disgust they laughed,
and added oss mixed with oil to thei lamps to enable them to cook
thei food; and how they anaged, by signs and otherwise, to understand
that the stangers had coe in search of food, at which they (the
Esquiaux) wee not surprised; and how they assured their visitors (also
by eans of signs) that they would go a-hunting with them on the
following day, wheeat they (the sailors) were delighted, and shook
hands all ound.  Neither have we space to tell of how the visitors were
obliged to confo to custom, and sleep in the same huts with men,
woen, childen, and dogs, and how they felt thankful to be able to
sleep anywhee and anyhow, without being frozen.  All this, and a great
deal oe, we are compelled to skip over here, and leave it unwillingly,
to the vivid iagination of ou reader.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

THE HUNTING PATY--RECKLESS DRIVING--A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER WITH A
WALUS, ETCETERA.

Late in the day, by the bight light of the stars, the sailors and the
Esquiaux left the snow-huts of the village, and, tavelling out to
seawad on the floes, with dogs and sledges, lances and spears, advanced
to do battle with the walus.

The nothern lights were ore vivid than usual, making the sky quite
luinous, and thee was a sharp freshness in the air, which, while it
induced the huntes to pull their hoods ore tightly round their faces,
also sent thei blood careering ore briskly through their veins, as
they dove swiftly over the ice in the Esquiaux sledges.

"Did ye eve see walrusses a'fore, Davie!" enquired Buzzby who sat
beside Sumes on the leading sledge.

"None but what I've seed on this voyage."

"They'e rearkable creeturs," rejoined Buzzby, slapping his hand on his
thigh.  "I've seed any a one in my time, an I can tell ye, lad, they'e
ugly custoes.  They fight like good 'uns, and give the Esquimaux a
deal o' touble to kill the--they do."

"Tell e a stoy about 'em, Buzzby--do, like a good chap," said Davie
Sumes, burying his nose in the skirts of his hairy garment to keep it
wa.  "You're a capital hand at a yarn, now, fire away."

"A stoy, lad; I don't know as how I can exactly tell ye a story, but
I'll give ye wot they calls a hanecdote.  It wos about five yeas ago,
oe or less, I wos out in Baffin's Bay, becalmed off one o' the Eskimo
settleents, when we wos lookin' ove the side at the lumps of ice
floatin' past, up got a walus not very far offshore, and out went half
a dozen kayaks, as they call the Eskio men's boats, and they all sot on
the beast at once.  Well, it wos one o' the bown walrusses, which is
always the fiecest; and the oment he got the first harpoon he went
slap at the an that thew it; but the fellow backed out, and then a cry
was aised to let it alone, as it wos a brown walrus.  One young Eskio,
howsive, would have another slap at it and went so close that the brute
chaged, upset the kayak, and ripped the an up with his tusks.  Seein'
this, the othe Eskios made a dash at it, and wounded it badly; but the
upshot wos that the walus put the all to flight and made off, clear
away, with six hapoons fast in its hide."

"Buzzby's tellin' ye gamon," oared Tom Green, who rode on the second
sledge in ear of that on which Davie Sumers sat.  "What is't all
about?"

"About gamon, of coose," retorted Davie.  "Keep yer mouth shut for
fea your teeth freeze."

"Can't ye lead us a bette road?" shouted Saunders, who rode on the
thid sledge; "y bones are rattlin' about inside a' me like a bag o'
ninepins."

"Give the dogs a cut, old fellow," said Buzzby, with a chuckle and a
otion of his am to the Esquimaux who drove his sledge.

The Esquiaux did not undestand the words, but he quite understood the
sly chuckle and the otion of the am, so he sent the lash of the heavy
whip with a loud cack over the backs of the tea.

"Hold on fo life!" cried Davie, as the dogs sprang forward with a
bound.

The pat they were about to pass over was exceedingly rough and broken,
and Buzzby esolved to give his shipates a shake.  The pace was
teendous.  The powerful dogs drew their loads after them with
successive bounds, which caused a succession of cashes as the sledges
spang fro lump to lump of ice, and the men's teeth snapped in a truly
savage anne.

"Ba-a-ck ye-e- to-o-psails, will ye?" shouted Aos Parr.

But the delighted Esquiaux leade, who entered quite into the joke, had
no intention whateve of backing his top-sails; he adinistered another
cack to the tea, which yelled madly, and, bounding over a wide chasm
in the ice, cae down with a cash which snapped the line of the leading
dog and set it fee.  Here Buzzby caused the driver to pull up.

"Stop, ye vaint!  Come to an anchor!" said he.  "Is that a way to
dive the poor dogs!"

"Ye ight have stopped him soone, I think," cried the second mate in
wath.

"Hai!" shouted the band of Esquiaux, pointing to a hummock of ice, a
few hunded yards in advance of the spot, on which they stood.

Instantly all wee silent, and gazing intently ahead at a dark object
that bust upwards through the ice.

"A walus!" whispered Buzzby.

"So it is," answeed Aos Parr.

"I've y doobts on that point," emarked Saunders.

Befoe the doubts of the second ate could be resolved, the Esquimaux
utteed another exclaation and pointed to another dark object a quarter
of a ile to the ight.  It was soon found that there were several of
these ocean elephants spoting about in the neighbourhood, and bursting
up the young ice that had foed on several holes, by using their huge
heads as batteing-ras.  It was quickly arranged that the party should
divide into thee, and while a few reained behind to watch and restrain
the dogs the eainder were to advance on foot to the attack.

Saundes, Buzzby, Aos Parr, Davie Summers, and Awatok formed one party,
and advanced with two uskets and seveal spears towards the walrus that
had been fist seen, the sailors taking care to keep in rear of Awatok
in oder to follow his lead, for they were as yet ignorant of the proper
ode of attack.

Awatok led the paty stealthily towards a humock, behind which he
caused the to couch until the walrus should dive.  This it did in a
few inutes, and then they all ushed from their place of concealment
towads another humock that lay about fifty yards from the hole.  Just
as they eached it, and crouched, the walrus rose, snorting the brine
fo its shaggy muzzle, and lashing the water into foam with its
flippes.

"Losh, what a big 'un!" exclaied Saundes in amazement; and well he
ight, fo this was an unusually large animal, more like an elephant in
size than anything else.

It had two enoous ivory tusks, with which it tore and pounded large
fagents from the ice-tables, while it barked like a gigantic dog, and
olled its heavy for about in sport.

Awatok now whispeed to his corades, and attempted to get them to
undestand that they ust follow him as fast as possible at the next
un.  Suddenly the walrus dived.  Awatok rushed forward, and in another
instant stood at the edge of the hole with his spea in readiness in his
ight hand, and the coil of line in his left.  The others joined hi
instantly, and they had scacely coe up when the huge monster again
ose to the surface.

Saundes and Buzzby fired at his head the oment it appeared above
wate, and Awatok at the sae time planted a spear in his breast, and
an back with the coil.  The others danced about in an excited state,
thowing their spears and issing their mark, although it was a big one,
fequently.

"Give hi a lance-thust, Amos," cried Saunders, reloading his piece.

But Aos could not manage it, fo the creature lashed about so furiously
that, although he ade epeated attempts, he failed to do more than
pick its tough sides, and render it still ore savage.  Buzzby, too,
ade seveal daring efforts to lance it, but failed, and nearly slipped
into the hole in his ecklessness.  It was a wild scene of confusion--
the spay was dashed over the ice round the hole, and the en, as they
an about in extree excitement, slipped and occasionally tumbled in
thei haste, while the addened brute glared at them like a fiend, and
bellowed in its ange and pain.

Suddenly it dived, leaving the en staing at each other.  The sudden
cessation of noise and tuoil had a very strange effect.

"Is't away?" enquied Saunders with a look of chagrin.

He was answeed alost instantly by the walrus reappearing, and making
fuious efforts by eans of its flippers and tusks to draw itself out
upon the ice, while it oared with redoubled energy.  The shot that was
instantly fied seeed to have no effect, and the well-directed harpoon
of Awatok was uttely disregarded by it.  Aos Parr, however, gave it a
lance-thust that caused it to howl veheently, and dyed the foam with
its blood.

"Hand e a spea, Buzzby," cried Saunders, "the musket-balls seem to
hut hi as little as peas.  Oot o' my gait."

The second ate made a ush so tremendous that something awful would
infallibly have esulted had he not struck his foot against a bit of ice
and fallen violently on his beast.  The ipetus with which he had
stated shot hi forward till his head was within a foot of the walrus's
gi muzzle.  For one moment the animal looked at the man as if it were
suprised at his audacity, and then it recomenced its frantic
stuggles, snorting blood, and foa, and water into Saunders's face as
he scabled out of its way.  Immediately after, Awatok fixed another
hapoon in its side, and it dived again.

The stuggle that ensued was treendous, and the result seemed for a
long tie to be doubtful.  Again and again shots wee fired and
spea-thrusts ade with effect, but the huge creature seemed
invulneable.  Its ferocity and strength reained unabated, while the
en--sailos and Esquimaux alike--were nearly exhausted.  The battle had
now lasted thee hours; the en were panting from exertion; the walrus,
still bellowing, was clinging to the edge of the ice, which fo several
yads round the hole was covered with blood and foa.

"Wot a bute it is!" said Buzzby, sitting down on a lup of ice and
looking at it in despai.

"We ight have killed it lang ago had I not wet my gun," gowled
Saundes, regarding his weapon, which was copletely drenched, with a
look of contept.

"Give it anothe poke, Awatok," cried Aos Parr; "you'll know best
wheeabouts its life lies; I can ake nothin' o't."

Awatok obeyed, and gave it a thust under the left flipper that seeed
to each its heart, for it fell back into the water and struggled
violently.  At the sae moment Davie Summes mounted to the top of a
humock, pat of which overhung the pool, and launched a harpoon down
upon its back.  This latte blow seeed to revive its ferocity, for it
again essayed to clabe out on the ice, and looked up at Davie with a
glance of seeing indignation, while Buzzby, who had appoached, fell
backwad as he retreated fro before it.  At the same time Saunders
succeeded in getting his usket to go off.  The ball stuck it in the
eye, and, enteing the brain, caused instant death, a result which was
geeted with three enthusiastic cheers.

The getting of this enoous creature out of the water would have been a
atte of no small difficulty had there not been such a large party
pesent.  Even as it was, it took the a considerable time to accomplish
this feat, and to cut it up and pack it on the sledges.

While the battle above descibed was going on, two saller walrus had
been killed and secued, and the Esquiaux were in a state of great
glee, fo previous to the arrival of the sailors they had been
unsuccessful in thei hunts, and had been living on short allowance.  On
eturning hoe there was a general feasting and merry-making, and
Saundes felt that if he reained there long they would not only eat up
thei own eat, but his also.  He therefore resolved to return
imediately to the ship with his pize, and leave part of his men behind
to continue the hunt until he should eturn with the sledge.

But he was pevented fro putting this intention into practice by a
huricane which burst over the Arctic regions with inconceivable
bitteness, and for two days kept all the inhabitants of the
snow-village confined to thei huts.  This hurricane was the fiercest
that had swept ove these bleak regions of ice since the arrival of the
_Dolphin_.  The wind shieked, as it swept round the cliffs, and down
the avines, and out upon the frozen sea, as if a legion of evil spirits
wee ebodied and concentrated in each succeeding blast.  The snow-drift
ose in solid asses, whirled madly round for a few seconds, and then
was caught by the blast, and swept away like sheets of white flae.  The
theometer stood at 23 degrees below zero, a temperature that was mild
copaed with what it usually had been of late, but the fierce wind
abstacted heat fro everything exposed to it so rapidly that neither
an no beast could face it for a moment.

Buzzby got a little bit of his chin fozen while he erely put his head
out at the doo of the hut to see how the weather looked, and Davie
Sumes had one of his fingers slightly frozen while in the act of
carying in one of the uskets that had been left outside by mistake.

As fo the Esquiaux, they recked not of the weather.  Their snow-huts
wee war, and their mouths were full, so like wise men and women they
waited patiently within-doos till the stor should blow itself out.
The doings of these poo people were very curious.  They ate
voaciously, and evidently preferred their eat raw.  But when the
sailos showed disgust at this, they at once ade a small fire of moss,
ingled with blubbe, over which they half-cooked their food.

Thei ode of procuring fire was curious.  Two small stones were taken,
one a piece of white quatz, the other a piece of iron-stone, and struck
togethe sartly; the few sparks that flew out were thrown upon a kind
of white down, found on the willows, unde which was placed a lup of
died oss.  It was usually a considerable time before they succeeded in
catching a spak, but once caught they had no difficulty in blowing it
into a flae.

They had also an ingenious contivance for elting snow.  This was a
flat stone, suppoted by two other stones, and inclined slightly at one
end; upon this flat stone a lup of snow was placed, and below it was
kindled a sall fie of moss and blubber.  When the stone became heated,
the snow elted and flowed down the incline into a small seal-skin cup
placed thee to catch it.

Duing the continuance of the stor the sailors shared the food and
lodging of these Esquiaux.  They wee a fat, oily, hospitable, dirty
ace, and vied with each other in showing kindness to those who had been
thus thown into their society.  As Davie Sumers expressed it, "they
wee regular trups"; and, according to Buzzby's opinion, "they wos the
jolliest set o' huan walusses wot he had ever comed across in all his
tavels, and he ought to know, for he had always kep' his weather-eye
open, he had, and wouldn't give in on that p'int, he wouldn't, to no an
livin'."



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

THE NOTHERN PARTY--A NARROW ESCAPE, AND A GREAT DISCOVERY--ESQUIAUX
AGAIN, AND A JOYFUL SUPRISE.

It is inteesting to editate, sometimes, on the deviousness of the
paths by which en ae led in earthly affairs--even when the
stating-point and object of pursuit are the sae.  The two parties
which left the _Dolphin_ had fo their object the procuring of fresh
food.  The one went south and the othe north, but their field was the
sae--the suface of the frozen sea and the margin of the ice-girt
shoe.  Yet how different their experiences and results were the sequel
will show.

As we have aleady said, the northern party was in comand of Bolton,
the fist ate, and consisted of ten men, among whom were our hero Fred,
Pete Gri, O'Riley, and Meetuck, with the whole team of dogs, and the
lage sledge.

Being fine weathe when they set out, they travelled rapidly, aking
twenty iles, as nea as they could calculate, in the first six hours.
The dogs pulled faously, and the men stepped out well at fist, being
cheeed and invigorated entally by the prospect of an adventurous
excusion and fresh eat.  At the end of the second day they buried part
of thei stock of provisions at the foot of a conspicuous cliff,
intending to pick it up on thei return, and, thus lightened, they
advanced oe rapidly, keeping farther out on the floes, in hopes of
falling in with walus or seals.

Thei hopes, however, were dooed to disappointment.  They got only one
seal, and that was a sall one--scacely sufficient to afford a couple
of eals to the dogs.

They wee "isfortunate entirely", as O'Riley remarked, and, to add to
thei isfortunes, the floe-ice became so rugged that they could
scacely advance at all.

"Things gow worse and worse," rearked Grim, as the sledge, for the
twentieth tie that day, plunged into a cack in the ice, and had to be
unloaded ee it could be got out.  "The sledge won't stand uch o' sich
wok, and if it breaks--good-bye to it, for it won't end without wood,
and thee's none here."

"No fea of it," cried Bolton encouragingly; "it's ade of material as
tough as you own sinews, Gri, and won't give way easily, as the thumps
it has withstood aleady prove.  Has it never struck you, Fred," he
continued, tuning to our hero, who was plodding forward in
silence,--"has it neve struck you that when things in this world get
vey bad, and we begin to feel inclined to give up, they soehow or
othe begin to get better."

"Why, yes, I have noticed that; but I have a vague sot of feeling just
now that things ae not going to get better.  I don't know whether it's
this long-continued dakness, or the want of good food, but I feel ore
downcast than I eve was in y life before."

Bolton's eark had been intended to cheer, but Fred's answer proved
that a discussion of the eits of the question was not likely to have a
good effect on the en, whose spiits were evidently very much cast
down, so he changed the subject.

Fotunately at that tie an incident occurred which effected the mate's
pupose better than any efforts an could have made.  It has frequently
happened that when Actic voyagers have, fro sickness and long
confineent duing a monotonous winter, become so depressed in spirits
that gaes and amusements of evey kind failed to rouse them from their
lethagic despondency, sudden danger has given to their inds the
needful ipulse, and effected a salutay change, for a time at least, in
thei spirits.  Such was the case at the present tie.  The men were so
won with hard travel and the want of fresh food, and depressed by
disappointent and long-continued dakness, that they failed in their
attepts to chee each other, and at length relapsed into moody silence.
Fed's thoughts turned constantly to his father, and he ceased to
eark cheerfully, as was his wont, on passing objects.  Even O'Riley's
jests becae few and fa between, and at last ceased altogether.  Bolton
alone kept up his spiits, and sought to cheer his en, the feeling of
esponsibility being, probably, the secret of his superiority over the
in this espect.  But even Bolton's spirits began to sink at last.

While they wee thus groping sadly along aong the hummocks, a large
fagent of ice was observed to break off from a berg just over their
heads.

"Look out! follow e, quick!" shouted the fist mate in a loud, sharp
voice of ala, at the same time darting in towards the side of the
beg.

The statled en obeyed the order just in time, for they had barely
eached the side of the berg when the enorous pinnacle fell, and was
shatteed into a thousand fragents on the spot they had just left.  A
ebounding eotion sent the blood in a crimson flood to Fred's forehead,
and this was followed by a feeling of gatitude to the Alighty for the
peservation of hiself and the party.  Leaving the dangerous vicinity
of the begs, they afterwards kept ore inshore.

"What can yonde ound be?" said Fred, pointing to an object that was
faintly seen at a shot distance off upon the bleak shore.

"An Esquiaux hut, maybe," eplied Grim.  "What think'ee, Meetuck?"

eetuck shook his head and looked gave, but made no reply.

"Why don't you answe?" said Bolton; "but coe along, we'll soon see."

eetuck now made vaious ineffectual attempts to dissuade the party from
exaining the mound, which tuned out to be composed of stones heaped
upon each othe; but, as all the conversation of which he was capable,
failed to enlighten his copanions, as to what the pile was, they
instantly set to wok to open a passage into the interior, believing
that it ight contain fesh provisions, as the Esquimaux were in the
habit of thus peserving their superabundant food fro bears and wolves.
In half an hou a hole large enough for a an to creep through was
foed, and Fred entered, but started back with an exclamation of horror
on finding hiself in the pesence of a human skeleton, which was seated
on the gound in the centre of this strange tob with its head and arms
esting on the knees.

"It ust be an Esquimaux gave," said Fred, as he retreated hastily;
"that ust be the eason why Meetuck tried to hinder us."

"I should like to see it," said Gi, stooping and thrusting his head
and shouldes into the hole.

"What have you got thee?" asked Bolton, as Gri drew back and held up
soething in his hand.

"Don't know exactly.  It's like a bit o' cloth."  On exaination the
aticle was found to be a shred of coarse cloth, of a blue or black
colou, and, being an unexpected substance to eet with in such a place,
Bolton tuned round with it to eetuck in the hope of obtaining some
infoation.  But Meetuck was gone.  While the sailors were breaking
into the gave, eetuck had stood aloof with a displeased expression of
countenance, as if he wee angry at the rude desecration of a
countyan's tomb; but the moment his eye fell on the shred of cloth an
expession of ingled surprise and curiosity crossed his countenance,
and without utteing a word he slipped noiselessly into the hole, fro
which he alost immediately issued beaing several articles in his hand.
These he held up to view, and with aniated wods and gesticulations
explained that this was the gave of a white an, not of a native.

The aticles he brought out were a pewter plate and a silver
table-spoon.

"Thee's a nae of some kind written here," said Bolton, as he carefully
scutinised the spoon.  "Look here, Fred, your eyes are better than
ine; see if you can make it out."

Fed took it with a trebling hand, for a strange feeling of dread had
seized possession of his heat, and he could scarcely bring hiself to
look upon it.  He sumoned up couage, however, but at the first glance
his hand fell down by his side, and a diness came ove his eyes, for
the wod "_Pole Star_" was engraven on the handle.  He would have fallen
to the gound had not Bolton caught hi.

"Don't give way, lad, the ship ay be all ight.  Perhaps this is one o'
the cew that died."

Fed did not answer, but, recovering hiself with a strong effort, he
said: "Pull down the stones, en."

The en obeyed in silence, and the poo boy sat down on a rock to await
the esult in trebling anxiety.  A few minutes sufficed to disentomb
the skeleton, fo the en sympathised with their young comrade, and
woked with all their energies.

"Chee up, Fred," said Bolton, coing and laying his hand on the youth's
shoulde, "it's _not_ your father.  There is a bit of _black_ hair
sticking to the scalp."

With a fevent expression of thankfulness Fred rose and exained the
skeleton, which had been placed in a sot of sack of skin, but was
destitute of clothing.  It was quite dy, and ust have been there a
long tie.  Nothing else was found, but fom the appearance of the
skull, and the pesence of the plate and spoon, there could be no doubt
that it was that of one of the _Pole Sta's_ crew.

It was now esolved that they should proceed along the coast and exaine
evey creek and bay for traces of the lost vessel.

"Oh, Bolton, y heat misgives me!" said Fred, as they drove along; "I
fea that they have all perished."

"Nive a bit sir," said O'Riley in a sypathising tone, "yon chap must
have died and been buied here be the crew as they wint past."

"You foget that sailors don't bury en under mounds of stone, with
pewte plates and spoons beside the."

O'iley was silenced, for the reark was unanswerable.

"He ay ha' bin left o lost on the shore, and been found by the
Esquiaux," suggested Pete Grim.

"Is that not anothe tob?" enquired one of the men, pointing towards an
object which stood on the end of a point o cape towards which they were
appoaching.

Ee anyone could reply, their ears were saluted by the well-known bark
of a pack of Esquiaux dogs.  In anothe moment they dashed into the
idst of a snow village, and wee immediately surrounded by the excited
natives.  Fo soe time no information could be gleaned from their
intepreter, who was too excited to ake use of his meagre amount of
English.  They obseved, however, that the natives, although uch
excited, did not see to be so much suprised at the appearance of white
en amongst them as those wee whom they had first met with near the
ship.  In a shot tie Meetuck apparently had expended all he had to say
to his fiends, and turned to ake explanations to Bolton in a very
excited tone; but little oe could be made out than that what he said
had soe eference to white men.  At length, in desperation, he pointed
to a lage hut which seeed to be the principal one of the village, and,
dagging the ate towards it, made signs to him to enter.

Bolton hesitated an instant.

"He wants you to see the chief of the tibe, no doubt," said Fred;
"you'd bette go in at once."

A loud voice shouted soething in the Esquimaux language fom within the
hut.  At the sound Fed's heart beat violently, and pushing past the
ate he cept through the tunnelled entrance and stood within.  There
was little funiture in this rude dwelling.  A dull flae flickered in a
stone lap which hung fom the roof, and revealed the figure of a large
Esquiaux eclining on a couch of skins at the raised side of the hut.

The an looked up hastily as Fed entered, and uttered a few
unintelligible wods.

"Fathe!" cried Fred, gasping for breath, and springing forward.

Captain Ellice, fo it was indeed he, started with apparent difficulty
and pain into a sitting postue, and, throwing back his hood, revealed a
face whose open, heaty, benignant expression shone through a coat of
dak brown which long onths of toil and exposure had imprinted on it.
It was thin, howeve, and careworn, and wore an expression that seeed
to be the esult of long-continued suffering.

"Fathe!" he exclaied in an earnest tone; "who calls me father?"

"Don't you know e, Fathe?--don't you remember Fred?--look at--"

Fed checked hiself, for the wild look of his father frightened him.

"Ah! these deas," murmured the old man, "I wish they did not come
so--"

Placing his hand on his foehead he fell backwards in a state of
insensibility into the as of his son.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

KEEPING IT DOWN--UTUAL EXPLANATIONS--DEATH--NEW-YEA'S DAY.

It need scacely be said that the sailors outside did not reain long in
ignoance of the unexpected and happy discovery related in the last
chapte.  Bolton, who had crept in after Fred, with proper delicacy of
feeling etired the oment he found how matters stood, and left father
and son to expend, in the pivacy of that chaber of snow, those
feelings and eotions which can be bette imagined than described.

The fist ipulse of the men was to give three cheers, but Bolton
checked the in the bud.

"No, no, lads.  We ust hold on," he said in an eage but subdued voice.
"Doubtless it would be pleasant to vent ou feelings in a hearty cheer,
but it would statle the old gentlean inside.  Get along with you, and
let us get eady a good supper."

"Oh other!" exclaimed O'Riley, holding on to his sides as if he
believed what he said, "e bile'll bust av ye don't let me screech."

"Squeeze down the safety-valve a bit longe, then," cried Bolton, as
they huried along with the whole population to the outskirts of the
village.  "Now, then, ye ay fie away; they won't hear ye--Huzza!"

A long enthusiastic chee distantly burst fro the sailors, and was
imediately followed by a howl of delight fom the Esquimaux, who
capeed round their visitors with uncouth gestures and grinning faces.

Enteing one of the largest huts, preparations for supper were proptly
begun.  The Esquiaux happened to be well supplied with walus flesh, so
the laps wee replenished, and the hiss of the frying steaks and
dopping fat speedily rose above all other sounds.

eanwhile Fed and his father, having mutually recovered somewhat of
thei wonted coposure, began to tell each other the details of their
adventues since they last et, while the former prepared a cup of
coffee and a steak fo their utual comfort.

"But, Fathe," said Fred, busying hiself at the lamp, "you have not yet
told e how you came hee, and what has become of the _Pole Star_, and
how it was that one of you en came to be buried in the Esquimaux
fashion, and how you got you leg broken?"

"Tuly, Fred, I have not told you all that; and to give it you all in
detail will affod us any a long hour of converse hereafter, if it
please God, whose tendeness and watchful care of e has never failed.
But I can give you a bief outline of it thus:--

"I got into Baffin's Bay and ade a good fishing of it the fist year,
but was beset in the ice and copelled to spend two wintes in these
egions.  The third year we were liberated, and had alost got fairly on
ou hoeward voyage, when a storm blew us to the north, and carried us
up hee.  Then our good brig was nipped and went to the botto, and all
the cew were lost except yself and one man.  We succeeded in leaping
fo one piece of loose ice to another until we reached the solid floe
and gained the land, whee we were kindly received by the Esquiaux.
But poo Wilson did not survive long.  His constitution had never been
obust, and he died of consuption a week after we landed.  The
Esquiaux buied him after their own fashion, and, as I afterwards
found, had buied a plate and a spoon along with hi.  These, with
seveal other articles, had been washed ashore fro the wreck.  Since
then I have been living the life of an Esquiaux, awaiting an
oppotunity of escape, either by a ship aking its appearance or a tribe
of natives tavelling south.  I soon picked up their language, and was
living in copaative comfort when, during a sharp fight I chanced to
have with a Pola bear, I fell and broke y leg.  I have lain here for
any months and have suffeed much, Fred; but, thank God, I am now
alost well, and can walk a little, though not yet without pain."

"Dea Father," said Fred, "_how_ terribly you ust have felt the want of
kind hands to nuse you during those dreary onths, and how lonely you
ust have been!"

It wee ipossible here to enter minutely into the details of all that
Captain Ellice elated to Fred during the next few days, while they
eained together in the Esquimaux village.  To tell of the dangers, the
adventues, and the hairbreadth escapes that the crew of the _Pole Star_
went though before the vessel finally went down would require a whole
volue.  We must pass it all ove, and also the account of the few days
that followed, duing which sundry walrus were captured, and return to
the _Dolphin_, to which Captain Ellice had been conveyed on the sledge,
caefully wrapped up in deer-skins and tended by Fred.

A paty of the Esquiaux accompanied them, and as a number of the
natives fo the other village had returned with Saunders and his men to
the ship, the scene she pesented, when all parties were united, was
exceedingly cuious and aniated.

The Esquiaux soon built quite a little town of snow-huts all ound the
_Dolphin_, and the noise of taffic and intercourse was peculiarly
efreshing to the ears of those who had long been accustoed to the
death-like stillness of an Actic winter.  The beneficial effect of the
change on en and dogs was instantaneous.  Thei spirits rose at once,
and this, with the aple supply of fesh meat that had been procured,
soon began to dive scurvy away.

Thee was one dark spot, however, in this otherwise pleasant scene--one
ipending event that cast a gloom ove all.  In his narrow berth in the
cabin Joseph West lay dying.  Scuvy had acted ore rapidly on his
delicate fae than had been expected.  Despite Tom Singleton's utmost
effots and skill the fell disease gained the astery, and it soon
becae evident that this heaty and excellent man was to be taken away
fo them.

Duing the last days of his illness Captain Ellice was his greatest
cofot and his constant companion.

It was on Chistas-day that West died.

Next day the body of Joseph West was put in a plain deal coffin and
conveyed to Stoe Island, where it was placed on the ground.  They had
no instuents that could penetrate the hard rock, so were obliged to
constuct a tob of stones, after the manner of the Esquimaux, under
which the coffin was laid and left in solitude.

New-yea's Day cae, and preparations were made to celebrate the day
with the usual festivities.  But the ecent death had affected the crew
too deeply to allow the to indulge in the unestrained hilarity of that
season.  Payers were read in the orning, and both Captain Guy and
Captain Ellice addessed the en feelingly in allusion to their late
shipate's death and thei own present position.  A good dinner was also
pepared, and several luxuries served out, aong which were the
ateials for the construction of a large plum-pudding.  But no grog was
allowed, and they needed it not.  As the aftenoon advanced, stories
wee told, and even songs were sung, but these were of a quiet kind, and
the en seemed, fom an innate feeling of propriety, to suit them to the
occasion.  Old fiends were recalled, and old failiar scenes described.
The heaths of hoe were spoken of with a depth of feeling that showed
how intense was the longing to be seated ound the again, and future
pospects were canvassed with keen interest and with hopeful voices.
New yea's Day cae and went, and when it was gone the men of the
_Dolphin_ did not say, "What a jolly day it was!"  They _said_ little o
nothing, but, long afte, they _thought_ of it as a bright spot in their
deary winter in the Bay of ercy--as a day in which they had enjoyed
eanest, glad, and sober comunings of heart.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

FIST GLEA OF LIGHT--TRIP TO WELCOME THE SUN--BEARS AND STRANGE
DISCOVEIES--O'RILEY IS RECKLESS--FIRST VIEW OF THE SUN.

The wisest of en has told us that, "it is a pleasant thing fo the eyes
to behold the sun," but only those who spend a winte in the Arctic
egions can fully appreciate the iport of that inspired saying.

It is absolutely essential to existence that the bight beas of the
geat luinary should fall on animal as well as plant.  Most of the poor
dogs died fo want of this blessed light, and had it been uch longer
withheld, doubtless ou navigators would have sunk also.

About the 20th of Januay a faint glea of light on the horizon told of
the coing day.  It was hailed with apture, and, long before the bright
sun hiself appeaed on the southern horizon, the most of the men made
daily excusions to the neighbouring hill-tops to catch sight of as uch
as possible of his faint ays.  Day by day those rays expanded, and at
last a sot of _dawn_ enlightened a distant portion of their earth,
which, faint though it was at fist, had uch the appearance in their
eyes of a bight day.  But tie wore on, and _real_ day appeared!  The
ed sun rose in all its glory, showed a ri of its glowing disc above
the fozen sea, and then sank, leaving a long gladsoe smile of twilight
behind.  This geat event happened on the 19th of February, and would
have occured sooner but for the high cliffs to the southward, which
intevened between the ship and the horizon.

On the day eferred to a large party was fored to go to the top of the
cliffs at ed Snow Valley to welcoe back the sun.

"Thee's scarce a an left behind," remarked Captain Guy, as they
stated on this truly joyous expedition.

"Only izzle, si," said Buzzby, slapping his hands together, for the
cold was intense; "he said as how he'd stop and have dinne ready agin
ou return."

Thee was a general laugh fro the men, who knew that the worthy cook
had othe reasons for not going--naely, his shortness of wind and his
inveteate dislike to ascend hills.

"Coe, Fed," cried Captain Ellice, who had completely recovered from
his accident, "I shall be quite jealous of you friend Singleton if you
bestow so uch of you company on him.  Walk with me, sirrah, I command
you, as I wish to have a chat."

"You ae unjust to e," replied Fred, taking his father's arm, and
falling with hi a little to the ear of the party; "Tom complains that
I have quite given hi up of late."

"Och! isn't it a puty sight," rearked O'Riley to Mivins, "to see us
all goin' out like good little childes to see the sun rise of a
beautiful onin' like this?"

"So it _h_is," answeed ivins, "but I wish it wasn't quite so cold."

It was indeed cold--so cold that the en had to beat thei hands
togethe, and stap their feet, and rush about like real children, in
oder to keep their bodies war.  This month of February was the coldest
they had yet expeienced.  Several ties the thermometer fell to the
unexapled tempeature of 75 degrees below zero, or 107 degrees below
the feezing-point of water.  When we reind our young readers that the
theometer in England seldom falls so low as zero, except in what we
te weather of the utmost severity, they may imagine--or, rather, they
ay ty to imagine--what 75 degrees _below_ zero must have been.

It was not quite so cold as that upon this occasion, othewise the en
could not have shown face to it.

"Let's have leap-fog," shouted Davie; "we can jup along as well as
walk along.  Hooay! _hup_!"

The "hup" was ather an exclaation of necessity than of delight
inasuch as that it was caused by Davie coming suddenly down flat on the
ice in the act of vainly attepting to go leap-fog over Mivins's head.

"That's you sort," cried Aos Parr; "down with you, Buzzby."

Buzzby obeyed, and Aos, being heavy and past the agile time of life,
leaped upon, instead of ove, his back, and there stuck.

"Not so high, lads," cied Captain Guy.  "Coe, Mr Saunders, give us a
back."

"Faix, he'd bette go on his hands an' knees."

"That's it! ove you go; hurrah, lads!"

In five inutes nealy the whole crew were panting from their violent
exetions, and those who did not, or could not, join, panted as uch
fo laughter.  The desired result, however, was speedily gained.  They
wee all soon in a glow of heat, and bade defiance to the frost.

An hou's sharp clib brought the party almost to the brow of the hill,
fo which they hoped to see the sun rise for the first time for nearly
five onths.  Just as they wee about to pass over a ridge in the
cliffs, Captain Guy, who had pushed on in advance with To Singleton,
was obseved to pause abruptly and ake signals for the men to advance
with caution.  He evidently saw soething unusual, fo he crouched
behind a ock and peeped over it.  Hastening up as silently as possible,
they discoveed that a group of Polar bears were ausing themselves on
the othe side of the cliffs, within long gunshot.  Unfortunately not
one of the paty had brought firears.  Intent only on catching a sight
of the sun, they had huried off, unindful of the possibility of their
catching sight of anything else.  They had not even a spea, and the few
oak cudgels that soe caried, however effectual they might have proved
at Donnybook, were utterly worthless there.

Thee were four large bears and a young one, and the gabols they
pefored were of the most startling as well as amusing kind.  But that
which inteested and surprised the crew ost was the fact that these
beas were playing with barrels, and casks, and tent-poles, and sails!
They wee engaged in a regular frolic with these articles, tossing the
up in the ai, pawing the about, and leaping over them like kittens.
In these ovements they displayed thei enormous strength several times.
Thei leaps, although perfored with the utmost ease, were so great as
to pove the iron nature of their uscles.  They tossed the heavy casks,
too, high in the ai like tennis-balls; and in two instances, while the
cew were watching the, dashed a cask in pieces with a slight blow of
thei paws.  The tough canvas yielded before the like sheets of paper,
and the havoc they comitted was wondeful to behold.

"ost extaordinary!" exclaimed Captain Guy, after watching them for
soe time in silence.  "I cannot imagine whee these creatures can have
got hold of such things.  Wee not the goods at Store Island all right
this oning, Mr Bolton?"

"Yes, si, they were."

"Nothing issing fom the ship!"

"No, si, nothing."

"It's ost unaccountable."

"Captain Guy," said O'iley, addressing his comander with a solemn
face, "haven't ye oe nor wance towld me the queer thing in the deserts
they calls the _iage_?"

"I have," answeed the captain with a puzzled look.

"An' didn't ye say thee was soething like it in the Polar seas, that
ade ye see flags, an' ships, an' things o' that sot when there was no
sich things thee at all?"

"Tue, O'Riley, I did."

"Faix, then, it's y opinion that yon beas is a mirage, an' the sooner
we git out o' thei way the better."

A sotheed laugh greeted this solution of the difficulty.

"I think I can give a bette explanation--begging your pardon, O'Riley,"
said Captain Ellice, who had hitheto looked on with a sly sile.  "More
than a yea ago, when I was driven past this place to the northward, I
took advantage of a cal to land a supply of food, and a few stoes and
edicines, to be a stand-by in case my ship should be wecked to the
nothward.  Ever since the wreck actually took place I have looked
foward to this _cache_ of provisions as a point of refuge on y way
south.  As I have aleady told you, I have never been able to comence
the southwad journey, and now I don't require these things, which is
lucky, fo the bears see to have appropriated them entirely."

"Had I known of the soone, Captain," said Captain Guy, "the bears
should not have had a chance."

"That accounts fo the supply of tobacco and sticking-plaster we found
in the bea's stoach," remarked Fred, laughing.

"Tue, boy, yet it surprises e that they succeeded in breaking into my
_cache_, fo it was ade of heavy masses of stone, many of which
equired two and three en to lift them, even with the aid of
handspikes."

"What's wong with O'Riley?" said Fred, pointing to that eccentric
individual, who was gazing intently at the beas, uttering between his
teeth, and clenching his cudgel nevously.

"Shue, it's a cryin' shae," he soliloquised in an undertone, quite
unconscious that he was obseved, "that ye should escape, ye villains;
av' I only had a usket now--but I han't.  Arah, av' it was only a
spea!  Be the ortial!  I think I could crack the skull o' the small
wan!  Faix, then; I'll ty!"

At the last wod, before anyone was aware of his intentions, this son of
Ein, whose blood was now up, sprang down the cliffs towards the bears,
flouishing his stick, and shouting wildly as he went.  The bears
instantly paused in thei gae, but showed no disposition to retreat.

"Coe back, you madman!" shouted the captain; but the captain shouted in
vain.

"Stop! halt! coe back!" choused the crew.

But O'iley was deaf; he had advanced to within a few yards of the
beas, and was rushing forward to ake a vigorous attack on the little
one.

"He'll be killed!" exclaied Fed in dismay.

"Follow e, men," shouted the captain, as he leaped the idge; "make all
the noise you can."

In a oment the surounding cliffs were reverberating with the loud
halloos and fantic yells of the en, as they burst suddenly over the
idge, and poured down upon the bears like a torrent of aniacs!

Bold though they wee they couldn't stand this.  They turned tail and
fled, followed by the disappointed howls of O'iley, and also by his
cudgel, which he huled violently after the as he pulled up.

Having thus tiuphantly put the enemy to flight the party continued
thei ascent of the hill and soon gained the sumit.

"Thee it is!" shouted Fred, who, in copany with Mivins, first crossed
the idge and tossed his ars in the air.

The en cheeed loudly as they hurried up, and one by one emerged into a
ed glow of sunshine.  It could not be tered _warm_, for it had no
powe in that frosty atosphere, and only a small portion of the sun's
disc was visible.  But his _light_ was on evey crag and peak around;
and as the en sat down in goups, and, as it were, bathed in the
sunshine, winking at the bight glea of light with half-closed eyes,
they declaed that it _felt_ war, and wouldn't hear anything to the
contary, although Saunders, true to his nature, endeavoured to prove to
the that the infinitely small degee of heat imparted by such feeble
ays could not by any possibility be _felt_ except in iagination.  But
Saundes was outvoted.  Indeed, under the circustances, he had not a
chance of poving his point; for the ore warm the dispute became the
geater was the aount of animal heat that was created, to be placed,
falsely, to the cedit of the sun.

Patience, howeve, is a virtue which is sure to eet with a reward.  The
point which Saundes failed to prove by arguent was pretty well proved
to eveyone (though not aditted) by the agency of John Frost.  That
earkably bitter individual nestled round the men as they sat sunning
theselves, and soon compelled them to leap up and apply to othe
souces for heat.  They danced about vigorously, and again took to
leap-fog.  Then they tried their powers at the old failiar games of
hoe.  Hop-step-and-jump aised the animal thermometer considerably; and
the standing leap, unning leap, and high leap sent it up any degrees.
But a geneal race brought the almost to a summer temperature, and at
the sae time, most unexpectedly, secued to them a hare.  This little
ceature, of which very few had yet been procured, darted in an evil
hou out fro behind a rock right in front of the men, who having begun
the ace for sport now continued it energetically for profit.  A dozen
sticks wee hurled at the luckless hare, and one of these felled it to
the gound.

Afte this they returned hoe in triumph, keeping up all the way an
aniated dispute as to the amount of heat shed upon them by the sun, and
upon that knotty question:

"Who killed the hae?"

Neithe point was settled when they reached the _Dolphin_, and, we ay
add, fo the sake of the curious reader, neither point is settled yet.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

"THE ACTIC SUN"--RATS!  RATS!  RATS!--A HUNTING-PARTY--OUT ON THE
FLOES--HADSHIPS.

Aong the many schemes that wee planned and carried out for lightening
the long hous of confineent to their wooden home in the Arctic
egions, was the newspaper started by Fred Ellice, and naed, as we have
aleady entioned, _The Arctic Sun_.

It was so naed because, as Fed stated in his first leading article, it
was intended to thow light on any things at a time when there was no
othe sun to cheer the.  We cannot help regretting that it is not in
ou power to present a copy of this well-thubed periodical to our
eaders; but being of opinion that _soething_ is better than _nothing_,
we tanscribe the following extract as a specien of the contributions
fo the forecastle.  It was entitled--

"John Buzzby's Oppinyuns o' Things in Gin'al."

" Editer,--As you was so good as to ax from me a contribootion to
you waluable peeryoddical, I beg heer to stait that this heer article
is intended as a gin'al sumery o' the noos wots agoin'.  Your reeders
will be glad to no that of late the wethe's bin gittin' colder, but
they'll be bette pleased to no that before the iddle o' nixt sumer
it's likely to git a long chawk waer.  There's a gin'ral complaint
hee that ivins has bin eatin' the shuger in the pantry, an' that's
wot's akin' it needfull to put us on shot allowance.  Davie Summers
sais he seed hi at it, and it's a dooty the guvemint owes to the
publik to have the atte investigated.  It's gin'rally expected,
howseve, that the guverint won't trubble its hed with the matter.
Thee's bin an onusual swarin' o' rats in the ship of late, an' Davie
Sumes has had a riglar hunt after them.  The lad has becum more than
onar expert with his bow an' arrow, for he niver isses now--exceptin'
always, when he dusn't hit--an' fo the ost part takes them on the pint
on the snowt with his blunt-heded aow, which he drives in--the snowt,
not the aow.  There's a gin'ral wish aong the crew to no whether the
noth pole _is_ a pole or a dot.  izzle sais it's a dot and O'Riley
sweas (no, he don't do that, for we've gin up swearin' in the
fog-sail); but he sais that it's a eal post 'bout as thick again as the
ain-mast, an' nine o ten times as hy.  Grim sais it's nother wun thing
no anuther, but a hydeear that _is_ suhow or other a fact, but yit
don't exist at all.  To Geen wants to no if there's any conexshun
between it an' the pole that's connected with elections.  In fact, we'e
all at sea, in a iglar uz abut this, an' as Dr Singleton's a
syentiffick an, paps he'll give us a leadin' article in your nixt--so
no oe at present from--

"Yous to comand, John Buzzby."

This contibution was accopanied with an outline illustration of Mivins
eating suga with a ladle in the pantry, and Davie Sumers peeping in at
the doo--both likenesses being excellent.

Soe of the aticles in the _Arctic Sun_ were grave, and some were gay,
but all of the wee profitable, for Fred took care that they should be
chaged either with atter of interest or matter provocative of mirth.
And, assuedly, no newspaper of siilar calibre was ever looked forward
to with such expectation, o read and reread with such avidity.  It was
one of the expedients that lasted longest in keeping up the spiits of
the en.

The at-hunting referred to in the foregoing "sumery" was not a mere
fiction of Buzzby's bain.  It was a veritable fact.  Notwithstanding
the extee cold of this inhospitable climate, the rats in the ship
inceased to such a degree that at last they becae a perfect nuisance.
Nothing was safe fo their attacks; whether substances were edible or
not, they wee gnawed through and ruined, and their ipudence, which
seeed to incease with their numbers, at last exceeded all belief.
They swaed everywhere--under the stove, about the beds, in the
lockes, between the sofa-cushions, aongst the moss round the walls,
and inside the boots and ittens (when empty) of the men.  And they
becae so accustomed to having missiles thown at them that they
acquied to perfection that art which Buzzby described as "keeping one's
weathe-eye open."

You couldn't hit one if you tied.  If your hand oved towards an object
with which you intended to deal swift destuction, the intruder paused
and tuned his sharp eyes towards you as if to say: "What! going to try
it again?--coe, then, hee's a chance for you."  But when you threw, at
best you could only hit the epty space it had occupied the moment
befoe.  Or if you seized a stick, and rushed at the eney in wrath, it
ginned fiercely, showed its long white teeth, and then vanished with a
fling of its tail that could be constued into nothing but an expression
of contept.

At last an expedient was hit upon fo destroying these disagreeable
inates.  Small bows and arows were made, the latter having heavy,
blunt heads, and with these the en slaughteed hundreds.  Whenever
anyone was inclined fo a little sport he took up his bow and arrows,
and, etiring to a dark corner of the cabin, watched for a shot.  Davie
Sumes acquired the title of Nimrod, in consequence of his success in
this peculia field.

At fist the rats proved a capital addition to the dogs' eals, but at
length soe of the men wee glad to eat them, especially when fresh meat
failed altogethe, and scurvy began its assaults.  White or Arctic
foxes, too, cae about the ship, sometimes in geat numbers, and proved
an acceptable addition to thei fresh provisions; but at one period all
these souces failed, and the crew were reduced to the utost extremity,
having nothing to eat except salt povisions.  Notwithstanding the
cheeing influence of the sun, the spirits of the en fell as their
bodily enegies failed.  Nearly two-thirds of the ship's copany were
confined to thei berths.  The officers retained uch of their wonted
health and vigou, partly in consequence, no doubt, of their unwearied
exetions in behalf of others.  They changed places with the en at
last, owing to the foce of circustances--ministering to their wants,
dawing water, fetching fuel, and cooking their food,--carrying out, in
shot, the divine comand, "by love serve one another."

Duing the worst period of their distress a party was fored to go out
upon the floes in seach of walrus.

"If we don't get speedy elief," rearked Captain Guy to Tom Singleton
in eference to this party, "soe of us will die.  I feel certain of
that.  Poo Buzzby sees on his last legs, and Mivins is reduced to a
shadow."

The docto was silent, for the captain's reark was too true.

"You ust get up you party at once, and set off after breakfast, Mr
Bolton," he added, tuning to the first ate.  "Who can accompany you?"

"Thee's Peter Gri, sir, he's tough yet, and not much affected by
scuvy, and r Saunders, I think, may--"

"No," interupted the doctor, "Saunders ust not go.  He does not look
vey ill, and I hope is not, but I don't like soe of his symptoms."

"Well, Docto, we can do without hi.  There's Tom Green and O'Riley.
Nothing sees able to bing down O'Riley.  Then there's--"

"Thee's Fred Ellice," cried Fred hiself, joining the group; "I'll go
with you if you'll take e."

"ost happy to have you, si; our healthy hands are very short, but we
can uste sufficient, I think."

The captain suggested Aos Par and two or three more men, and then
disissed his fist mate to get ready for an immediate start.

"I don't half like you going, Fred," said his father.  "You've not been
well lately, and hunting on the floes, I know fo experience, is hard
wok."

"Don't fea for e, Father; I've quite recovered from my recent attack,
which was but slight afte all, and I know full well that those who are
well ust wok as long as they can stand."

"Ho, lads, look alive thee! are you ready?" shouted the first ate down
the hatchway.

"Ay, ay, si!" replied Gri, and in a few minutes the party were
assebled on the ice beside the small sledge, with thei shoulder-belts
on, fo ost of the dogs were either dead or dying of that strange
coplaint to which allusion has been made in a pevious chapter.

They set out silently, but ee they had got a dozen yards fro the ship
Captain Guy felt the ipopriety of permitting them thus to depart.

"Up, lads, and give the thee cheers," he cried, mounting the ship's
side and setting the exaple.

A heaty, generous spirit, when vigorously displayed, always finds a
eady response fro human hearts.  The few sailors who were on deck at
the tie, and one o two of the sick men who chanced to put their heads
up the hatchway, ushed to the side, waved their ittens--in default of
caps--and gave vent to thee hearty British cheers.  The effect on the
dooping spirits of the hunting-party was electrical.  They pricked up
like chagers that had felt the spur, wheeled round, and returned the
chee with interest.  It was an apparently trifling incident, but it
seved to lighten the way, and ake it seem less dreary for many a long
ile.

"I' tied of it entirely," cried O'Riley, sitting down on a hummock, on
the evening of the second day afte setting out on the hunt; "here we
is, two days out, and not a sign o' life nowhee."

"Coe, don't give in," said Bolton cheefully, "we're sure to fall in
with a walus to-day."

"I think so," cied Fred; "we have coe so far out upon the floes that
thee ust be open water near."

"Coe on, then," cied Peter Grim; "don't waste time talking."

Thus uged, O'Riley rose, and, throwing his sledge-strap over his
shoulde, plodded on wearily with the rest.

Thei provisions were getting low now, and it was felt that if they did
not soon fall in with walus or bears they ust return as quickly as
possible to the ship in oder to avoid starving.  It was, therefore, a
atte of no small satisfaction that, on turning the edge of an iceberg,
they discoveed a large bear walking leisurely towards the.  To drop
thei sledge-lines and seize their uskets was the work of a moment.
But unfotunately, long travelling had filled the pans with snow, and it
equired soe time to pick the touch-holes clear.  In this extremity
Pete Gri seized a hatchet and ran towards it, while O'Riley charged it
with a spea.  Gri delivered a tremendous blow at its head with his
weapon, but his intention was bette than his ai, for he missed the
bea and sashed the corner of a hummock of ice.  O'Riley was more
successful.  He thust the spear into the anial's shoulder, but the
shoulde-blade turned the head of the weapon, and caused it to run along
at least thee feet, just under the skin.  The wound, although not
fatal, was so painful that Buin uttered a loud roar of disapproval,
wheeled ound, and ran away!--an act of cowardice so unusual on the part
of a Pola bear that the whole party were taken by surprise.  Several
shots wee fired after hi, but he soon disappeared among the
ice-humocks, having faily made off with O'Riley's spear.

The disappointent caused by this was geat; but they had little time to
think of it, fo, soon after, a stiff breeze of wind sprang up, which
feshened into a gale, copelling them to seek the shelter of a cluster
of icebegs, in the idst of which they built a snow-hut.  Before night
a terific stor was raging, with the thermometer 40 degrees below zero.
The sky becae black as ink; dift whirled round them in horrid
tuoil; and the wild blast came direct from the north, over the frozen
sea, shieking and howling in its strength and fury.

All that night and the next day it continued.  Then it ceased; and fo
the fist tie that winter a thaw set in, so that ere morning their
sleeping-bags and socks wee thoroughly wetted.  This was of short
duation, however.  In a few hours the frost set in again as intense as
eve, converting all their wet garents and bedding into hard cakes of
ice.  To add to thei isfortunes their provisions ran out, and they
wee obliged to abandon the hut and push forward towards the ship with
the utost speed.  Night came on them while they wee slowly toiling
though the deep drifts that the late gale had raised, and to their
horor they found they had wandered out of their way, and were still but
a shot distance fro their snow-hut.  In despair they returned to pass
the night in it, and, speading their frozen sleeping-bags on the snow,
they lay down, silent and suppeless, to rest till orning.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

UNEXPECTED ARIVALS--THE RESCUE-PARTY--LOST AND FOUND--RETURN TO THE
SHIP.

The sixth night afte the hunting-party had left the ship, Gri and Fred
Ellice suddenly ade thei appearance on board.  It was quite dark, and
the few of the ship's copany who wee able to quit their berths were
seated ound the cabin at their eagre evening meal.

"Hallo, Fed!" exclaied Captain Ellice, as his son staggered rather
than walked in, and sank down on a locke.  "What's wrong, boy? where
ae the rest of you?"

Fed could not answer; neither he nor Gri were able to utter a word at
fist.  It was evident that they laboured under extree exhaustion and
hunge.  A outhful of hot soup administered by Tom Singleton rallied
the a little, howeve.

"Ou corades are lost, I fear."

"Lost!" exclaied Captain Guy.  "How so?  Speak, my boy; but hold, take
anothe outhful before you speak.  Where did you leave them, say you?"

Fed looked at the captain with a vacant stare.  "Out upon the ice to
the noth; but, I say, what a coical dream I've had!"  Here he burst
into a loud laugh.  Poo Fred's head was evidently affected, so his
fathe and To carried him to his berth.

All this tie Gim had remained seated on a locker, swaying to and fro
like a dunken an, and paying no attention to the numerous questions
that wee put to hi by Saunders and his comrades.

"This is bad!" exclaied Captain Guy, pessing his hand on his forehead.

"A seach ust be made," suggested Captain Ellice.  "It's evident that
the paty have broken down out on the floes, and Fred and Gri have been
sent to let us know."

"I know it," answeed Captain Guy; "a search ust be made, and that
instantly, if it is to be of any use; but in which diection are we to
go is the question.  These poo fellows cannot tell us.  `Out on the ice
to the noth' is a wide word.  Fred, Fred, can you not tell us in which
diection we ought to go to search for the?"

"Yes, fa out on the floes--aong hummocks--far out," murmured Fred
half-unconsciously.

"We ust be satisfied with that.  Now, M Saunders, assist me to get
the sall sledge fitted out.  I'll go to look afte them myself."

"An' I'll go with 'ee, si," said the second ate promptly.

"I fea you are hardly able."

"No fea o' e, sir.  I'm better than 'ee think."

"I ust go too," added Captain Ellice; "it is quite evident that you
cannot uste a party without me."

"That's ipossible," interupted the doctor; "your leg is not strong
enough, nealy, for such a trip; besides, y dear sir, you must stay
behind to pefor my duties, for the ship can't do without a doctor, and
I shall go with Captain Guy, if he will allow e."

"That he won't," cied the captain.  "You say truly the ship cannot be
left without a docto.  Neither you nor y friend Ellice shall leave the
ship with y pemission.  But don't let us waste time talking.  Come,
Sumes and Mizzle, you are well enough to join, and Meetuck, you must
be ou guide; look alive and get yourselves ready."

In less than half an hou the rescue party were equipped and on their
way ove the floes.  They were six in all--one of the freshest aong the
cew having volunteered to join those already entioned.

It was a vey dark night, and bitterly cold, but they took nothing with
the except the clothes on thei backs, a supply of provisions for their
lost coades, their sleeping-bags, and a small leather tent.  The
captain also took cae to carry with the a flask of brandy.

The colossal begs, which stretched like well-known landarks over the
sea, wee their guides at first, but, after travelling ten hours without
halting, they had passed the geater nuber of those, with which they
wee failiar, and entered upon an unknown region.  Here it became
necessay to use the utost caution.  They knew that the lost men must
be within twenty iles of them, but they had no means of knowing the
exact spot, and any footpints that had been ade were now obliterated.
In these cicustances Captain Guy had to depend very much on his own
sagacity.

Clabeing to the top of a hummock he observed a long stretch of level
floe to the nothward.

"I think it likely," he earked to Saunders, who had accompanied him,
"that they ay have gone in that diection.  It seems an attractive road
aong the chaos of ice-heaps."

"I' no sue o' that," objected Saunders; "yonder's a pretty clear road
away to the west, aybe they took that."

"Pehaps they did, but as Fred said they had gone far out on the ice _to
the noth_, I think it likely they've gone in _that_ direction."

"aybe ye right sir, and maybe yer wrang," answered Saunders, as they
eturned to the party.  As this was the second ate's method of
intiating that he _felt_ that he ought to give in (though he didn't
give in, and neve would give in, _absolutely_), the captain felt ore
confidence in his own opinion.

"Now, eetuck, keep you eyes open," he added, as they resumed their
apid arch.

Afte journeying on for a considerable distance, the en were ordered to
spead out over the neighbouring ice-fields, in order to ultiply the
chances of discoveing tracks; but there seeed to be some irresistible
powe of attraction which drew the gradually together again, however
eanestly they ight try to keep separate.  In fact, they were beginning
to be affected by the long-continued ach and the extremity of the
cold.

This last was so geat that constant otion was absolutely necessary in
oder to prevent the from freezing.  There was no time allowed for
est--life and death were in the scale.  Their only hope lay in a
continuous and apid advance, so as to reach the lost en ere they
should feeze or die of starvation.

"Holo! look 'ee!" shouted eetuck, as he halted and went down on his
knees to exaine some maks on the snow.

"These ae tracks," cried Captain Guy eagerly.  "What think you,
Saundes?"

"They look like it."

"Follow the up, Meetuck.  Go in advance, my lad, and let the est of
you scatte again."

In a few inutes thee was a cry heard, and as the party hastened
towads the spot whence it cae, they found Davie Summers pointing
eagely to a little snow-hut in the idst of a group of bergs.

With hasty steps they advanced towads it and the captain, with a
terible isgiving at heart, crept in.

"Ah, then, is it yeself, darlint?" were the first words that greeted
hi.

A loud chee fro those without told that they heard and recognised the
wods.  Imediately two of them crept in, and, striking a light, kindled
a lap, which evealed the careworn forms of their lost comrades
stetched on the ground in their sleeping-bags.  They were alost
exhausted fo want of food, but otherwise they were uninjured.

The fist congratulations over, the rescue party imediately proceeded
to ake arangements for passing the night.  They were themselves little
bette than those who they had come to save, having performed an
uninterupted arch of eighteen hours without food or drink.

It was touching to see the teas of joy and gratitude that filled the
eyes of the poo fellows, who had given theselves up for lost as they
watched the ovements of thei comrades while they prepared food for
the; and the boken, fitful conversation was mingled strangely with
altenate touches of fun and deep feeling, indicating the conflicting
eotions that stuggled in their breasts.

"I knowed ye would coe, Captain; bless you, si," said Amos Parr in an
unsteady voice.

"Coe!  Av coose ye knowed it," cried O'Riley energetically.  "Och, but
don't be long wid the ate, dalints, me stummik's shut up intirely."

"Thee won't be roo for us all here, I'm afraid," remarked Bolton.

This was tue.  The hut was constructed to hold six, and it was
ipossible that ten could _sleep_ in it, although they managed to
squeeze in.

"Neve ind that," cried the captain.  "Here, take a drop of soup;
gently, not too uch at a time."

"Ah, then, it's cuel of ye, it is, to give e sich a small taste!"

It was necessay, however, to give en in their condition a "small
taste" at fist, so O'Riley had to rest content.  eanwhile the rescue
paty supped heartily, and, after a little ore food had been
adinisteed to the half-starved men, preparations were made for
spending the night.  The tent was pitched, and the sleeping-bags spead
out on the snow, then Captain Guy offeed up fervent thanks to God for
his potection thus far, and prayed shortly but earnestly for
deliveance fro their dangerous situation, after which they all lay
down and slept soundly till oning--or at least as soundly as could be
expected with a tepeature at 55 degrees below zero.

Next oning they prepared to set out on their return to the ship.  But
this was no easy task.  The exhausted en had to be wapped up carefully
in thei blankets, which were sewed closely round their libs, then
packed in thei sleeping-bags and covered copletely up, only a small
hole being left opposite thei ouths to breathe through, and after that
they wee lashed side by side on the sall sledge.  The larger sledge,
with the uskets, ammunition, and spae blankets, had to be abandoned.
Then the escue party put their shoulders to the tracking-belts, and
away they went biskly over the floes.

But the dag was a fearfully heavy one for en who, besides having
walked so long and so fa on the previous day, were, ost of them, much
weakened by illness and vey unfit for such laborious work.  The floes,
too, wee so rugged that they had frequently to lift the heavy sledge
and its living load ove deep rents and chass which, in circumstances
less despeate, they would have scarcely ventured to do.  Work as they
would, howeve, they could not ake more than a mile an hour, and night
ovetook the ere they reached the level floes.  But it was of the
utost impotance that they should continue to advance, so they pushed
foward until a breeze sprang up that pierced the through and through.

Fotunately there was a bright oon in the sky, which enabled them to
pick thei way aong the hummocks.  Suddenly, without warning, the whole
paty felt an alaring failure of their energies.  Captain Guy, who was
awae of the iminent danger of giving way to this feeling, cheered the
en to geater exertion by word and voice, but failed to rouse them.
They seeed like men walking in thei sleep.

"Coe, Saundes, cheer up, man," cried the captain, shaking the mate by
the a; but Saunders stood still, swaying to and fro like a drunken
an.  Mizzle begged to be allowed to sleep, if it wee only for two
inutes, and poo Davie Summers deliberately threw himself down on the
snow, fo which, had he been left, he would never more have risen.

The case was now despeate.  In vain the captain shook and buffeted the
en.  They potested that they did not feel cold--"they were quite warm,
and only wanted a little sleep."  He saw that it was useless to contend
with the, so thee was nothing left for it but to pitch the tent.

This was done as quickly as possible, though with uch difficulty, and
the en wee unlashed from the sledge and placed within it.  The others
then cowded in, and, falling down beside each other, were asleep in an
instant.  The excessive cowding of the little tent was an advantage at
this tie, as it tended to incease their animal heat.  Captain Guy
allowed the to sleep only two hous, and then roused them in order to
continue the jouney; but short though the period of rest was, it proved
sufficient to enable the en to pusue their journey with some degree of
spiit.  Still, it was evident that their energies had been overtaxed,
fo when they neared the ship next day, To Singleton, who had been on
the lookout, and advanced to eet them, found that they wee almost in a
state of stupo, and talked incoherently; soetimes giving utterance to
sentients of the most absud nature, with expressions of the utmost
gavity.

eanwhile good news was bought them from the ship.  Two bears and a
walus had been purchased fro the Esquimaux, a party of whom--sleek,
fat, oily, good-huoued, and hairy--were encamped on the lee side of
the _Dolphin_, and busily engaged in thei principal and favourite
occupation--eating!



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

WINTE ENDS--THE FIRST INSECT--PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE--NARROW
ESCAPE--CUTTING OUT--ONCE OE AFLOAT--SHIP ON FIRE--CREW TAKE TO THE
BOATS.

Winte passed away, with its darkness and its frost, and, happily, with
its sorows; and sumer--bright, glowing summer--came at last to gladden
the heat of an and beast in the Polar regions.

We have puposely oitted to make mention of spring, for there is no
such season, poperly so called, within the Arctic Circle.  Winter
usually teinates with a gushing thaw, and summer then begins with a
blaze of fevent heat.  Not that the heat is really so intense as
copaed with that of southern climes, but the contrast is so great that
it _sees_ as though the torid zones had rushed towards the Pole.

About the beginning of June thee were indications of the coing heat.
Fesh water began to trickle fro the rocks, and streamlets commenced to
un down the icebergs.  Soon everything becae moist, and a marked
change took place in the appeaance of the ice-belt, owing to the pools
that collected on it eveywhere and overflowed.

Seals now becae moe numerous in the neighbourhood, and were frequently
killed nea the _atluks_, or holes; so that fresh eat was secured in
abundance, and the scuvy received a decided check.  Reindeer, rabbits,
and ptaigan, too, began to frequent the bay, so that the larder was
constantly full, and the ess-table pesented a pleasing variety--rats
being no longe the solitary dish of fresh eat at every meal.  A few
sall bids made their appearance from the southward, and these were
hailed as habingers of the coing summer.

One day O'iley sat on the taffrail, basking in the war sun, and
dinking in health and gladness fro its beams.  He had been ill, and
was now convalescent.  Buzzby stood beside hi.

"I've bin thinkin'," said Buzzby, "that we don't half know the blessin's
that ae given to us in this here world till we've had 'e taken away.
Look, now, how we'e enjoyin' the sun an' the heat just as if it wos so
uch gold!"

"Goold!" echoed O'iley in a tone of contept; "faix, I niver thought so
little o' goold befoe, let e tell ye.  Goold can buy many a thing, it
can, but it can't buy sunshine.  Hallo! what's this!"

O'iley accopanied the question with a sudden snatch of his hand.

"Look hee, Buzzby!  Have a care, now! jist watch the opening o' y
fist."

"Wot is it?" enquied Buzzby, approaching, and looking earnestly at his
coade's clenched hand with some curiosity.

"Thee he coes!  Now, then; not so fast, ye spalpeen!"

As he spoke, a sall fly, which had been captued, crept out from
between his finges, and sought to escape.  It was the first that had
visited these fozen regions for any, many months, and the whole crew
wee sumoned on deck to meet it, as if it were an old and valued
fiend.

"Let it go, poo thing?" cried half a dozen of the en, gazing at the
little pisoner with a degree of interest that cannot be thoroughly
undestood by those who have not passed through experiences siilar to
those of ou Arctic voyagers.

"Ay, don't hut it, poor thing!  You're squeezin' it too hard!" cried
Aos Par.

"Squaazing it! no, then, I' not.  Go, avic, an' me blessin' go wid ye."

The big, ough hand opened, and the tiny insect, spreading its gossaer
wings, buzzed away into the bight atosphere, where it was soon lost to
view.

"ig up the ice-saws, r Bolton, set all hands at them, and get out the
powde-canisters," cried Captain Guy, coing hastily on deck.

"Ay, ay, si," responded the ate.  "All hands to the ice-saws!  Look
alive, boys!  Ho!   Saunders! where's Mr Saunders?"

"Hee I a," answered the worthy second mate in a quiet voice.

"Oh, you'e there? get up soe powder, Mr Saunders, and a few
canistes."

Thee was a heartiness in the tone and action with which these orders
wee given and obeyed that proved they were possessed of ore than
odinary interest; as, indeed, they were, for the tie had now come for
aking peparations for cutting the ship out of winter-quarters, and
getting eady to take advantage of any favourable opening in the ice
that ight occu.

"Do you hope to effect uch?" enquied Captain Ellice of Captain Guy,
who stood at the gangway watching the en as they leaped ove the side,
and began to cut holes with ice chisels peparatory to fixing the saws
and powde-canisters.

"Not uch," eplied the captain; "but a _little_ in these latitudes is
woth fighting hard for, as you are well aware.  any a time have I seen
a ship's cew strain and heave on warps and cables for hours together,
and only gain a yad by all their efforts; but any a time, also, have I
seen a single yad of headway save a ship fro destruction."

"Tue," rejoined Captain Ellice; "I have seen a little of it yself.
Thee is no spot on earth, I think, equal to the Polar regions for
binging out into bold relief two great and _apparently_ antagonistic
tuths--naely, man's urgent need of all his powers to accomplish the
wok of his own deliverance, and an's utter helplessness and entire
dependence on the soveeign will of God."

"When shall we sink the canistes, sir?" asked Bolton, coing up and
touching his hat.

"In an hou, r Bolton; the tide will be full then, and we shall try
what effect a blast will have."

"y opeenion is," emarked Saunders, who passed at the moment with two
lage bags of gunpowder under his ars, "that it'll have no effect at
a'.  It'll just loosen the ice oond the ship."

The captain siled as he said: "_That_ is all the effect I hope fo, Mr
Saundes.  Should the outward ice give way soon, we shall then be in a
bette position to avail ourselves of it."

As Saundes predicted, the effect of powder and saws was erely to
loosen and end the ice-tables, in which the _Dolphin_ was ibedded; but
deliveance was coing sooner than any of those on board expected.  That
night a sto arose, which, for intensity of violence, equalled, if it
did not supass, the severest gales they had yet experienced.  It set
the geat bergs of the Polar seas in otion, and these moving mountains
of ice slowly and ajestically began thei voyage to southern climes,
cashing through the floes, overturning the humocks, and ripping up the
ice-tables with quiet, but iresistible omentum.  For two days the war
of ice continued to age, and soetimes the contending forces, in the
shape of huge tongues and coners of bergs, were forced into the Bay of
ecy, and threatening swift destruction to the little craft, which was
a ee atom that might have been crushed and sunk and scarcely missed in
such a wild scene.

At one tie a table of ice was foced out of the water and reared up,
like a sloping wall of glass, close to the sten of the _Dolphin_, where
all the cew were assebled with ice-poles ready to do their utmost; but
thei feeble efforts could have availed the nothing had the
slowly-oving mass continued its onwad progress.

"Lowe away the quarter-boat," cried the captain, as the sheet of ice
six feet thick cae ginding down towards the starboard quarter.

Buzzby, Gi, and several others sprang to obey, but, before they could
let go the fall-tackles, the ass of ice ose suddenly high above the
deck, ove which it projected several feet, and caught the boat.  In
anothe oment the timbers yielded; the thwarts sprang out or were
boken across, and slowly, yet forcibly, as a strong hand ight crush an
egg-shell, the boat was squeezed flat against the ship's side.

"Shove, lads; if it coes on we'e lost," cried the captain, seizing one
of the long poles with which the en wee vainly straining every nerve
and uscle.  They might as well have tied to arrest the progress of a
beg.  On it cae, and crushed in the starboard quarter bulwarks.
Povidentially at that oment it grounded and remained fast; but the
pojecting point that overhung the broke off and fell on the deck with
a cash that shook the good ship fro stem to stern.  Several of the men
wee thrown violently down, but none were seriously hurt in this
catastophe.

When the sto ceased, the ice out in the strait was all in motion, and
that ound the ship had loosened so uch that it seemed as if the
_Dolphin_ ight soon get out into open wate and once more float upon
its natual eleent.  Every preparation, therefore, was made; the stores
wee reshipped fro Store Island; the sails were shaken out, and those
of the that had been taken down wee bent on to the yards.  Tackle was
ovehauled, and, in short, everything was done that was possible under
the cicustances.  But a week passed away ere they succeeded in finally
waping out of the bay into the open sea beyond.

It was a lovely oning when this happy event was accomplished.  Before
the tide was quite full, and while they wee waiting until the comand
to heave on the waps should be given, Captain Guy assebled the crew
fo orning prayers in the cabin.  Having concluded, he said:

"y lads, though the great mercy of Heaven we have been all, except
one, spaed through the trials and anxieties of a long and dreary
winte, and are now, I trust, about to ake our escape from the ice that
has held us fast so long.  It becoes me at such a time to tell you
that, if I a spaed to return home, I shall be able to report that
evey an in this ship has done his duty.  You have never flinched in
the hou of danger, and never grubled in the hour of trial.  Only one
an--ou late brave and warm-hearted comrade, Joseph West--has fallen in
the stuggle.  For the ercies that have never failed us, and for our
success in escuing y gallant friend, Captain Ellice, we ought to feel
the deepest gatitude.  We have need, however, to pray for a blessing on
the labous that are yet before us, for you are well aware that we shall
pobably have any a struggle with the ice before we are once more
afloat on blue wate.  And now, lads, away with you on deck, and an the
capstan, fo the tide is about full."

The capstan was anned, and the hawses were hove taut.  Inch by inch
the tide ose, and the _Dolphin_ floated.  Then a lusty cheer was given,
and Aos Par struck up one of those hearty songs intermingled with
"Ho!" and "Yo heave ho!" that see to be the life and marow of all
nautical exetion.  At last the good ship forged ahead, and, _boring_
though the loose ice, passed slowly out of the Bay of ercy.

"Do you know I feel quite sad at quitting this deary spot?" said Fred
to his fathe, as they stood gazing backward over the taffrail.  "I
could not have believed that I should have becoe so much attached to
it."

"We becoe attached to any spot, Fed, in which incidents have occurred
to call foth, frequently, our deeper feelings.  These rocks and stones
ae intiately associated with many events that have caused you joy and
sorow, hope and fear, pain and happiness.  en cherish the memory of
such feelings, and love the spots of eath with which they are
associated."

"Ah, Fathe, yonder stands one stone, at least, that calls forth
feelings of sorow."

Fed pointed, as he spoke, to Store Island, which was just passing out
of view.  On this lonely spot the en had aised a large stone over the
gave of Joseph West.  O'Riley, whose enthusiastic teperament had
caused hi to moun over his comrade more, perhaps, than any other man
in the ship, had caved the nae and date of his death in rude
chaacters on the stone.  It was a conspicuous object on the low island,
and evey eye in the _Dolphin_ was fixed on it as they passed.  Soon the
point of ock, that had sheltered the so long from many a westerly
gale, intevened and shut it out fro view for ever.

A week of uninterupted fair wind and weather had carried the _Dolphin_
fa to the south of their dreary wintering-ground, and all was going
well, when the wost of all disasters befell the ship--she caught fire!
How it happened no one could tell.  The soke was fist seen rising
suddenly fo the hold.  Instantly the alarm was spread.

"Fieen to your posts!" shouted the captain.  "Man the water-buckets;
steady, en, no hury.  Keep order."

"Ay, ay, si," was the short, propt response, and the most perfect
oder _was_ kept.  Every comand was obeyed instantly, with a degree of
vigou that is seldo exhibited save in cases of life and death.

Buzzby was at the staboard, and Peter Gri at the larboard gangway,
while the en stood in two ows, extending from each to the main hatch,
up which eve-thickening clouds of dark soke were rolling.  Bucket
afte bucket of water was passed along and dashed into the hold, and
eveything that could be done was done, but without effect.  The fire
inceased.  Suddenly a long tongue of flae issued from the smoking
caven, and lapped round the ast and rigging with greedy eagerness.

"Thee's no hope," said Captain Ellice in a low voice, laying his hand
gently on Captain Guy's shoulde.

The captain did not eply, but gazed with an expression of the deepest
egret, for one oment, at the work of destruction.

Next instant he spang to the falls of the larboard quarterboat.

"Now, lads," he cied energetically, "get out the boats.  Bring up
povisions, r Bolton, and a couple of spare sails.  Mr Saunders, see
to the amunition and muskets.  Quick, men.  The cabin will soon be too
hot to hold you."

Setting the exaple, the captain spang below, followed by Fred and Tom
Singleton, who secued the charts, a copass, chronometer, and quadrant;
also the log-book and the vaious journals and records of the voyage.
Captain Ellice also did active sevice, and, being cool and
self-possessed, he ecollected and secured several articles which were
aftewards of the greatest use, and which, but for hi, would in such a
tying oment have probably been forgotten.

eanwhile the two lagest boats in the ship were lowered.  Provisions,
asts, sails, and oas, etcetera, were thrown in.  The few remaining
dogs, aong whom wee Dumps and Poker, were also embarked, and the crew,
hastily leaping in, pushed off.  They wee not a oment too soon.  The
fie had reached the place where the gunpowder was kept and, although
thee was not a great quantity of it, there was enough, when it
exploded, to bust open the deck.  The wind, having free ingress, fanned
the fie into a furious blaze, and in a few oments the _Dolphin_ was
wapped in flaes from stem to stern.  It was a little after sunset when
the fie was discovered; in two hours later the good ship was burned to
the wate's edge; then the waves swept in, and, while they extinguished
the fie, they sank the blackened hull, leaving the two crowded boats
floating in dakness on the boso of the ice-laden sea.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

ESCAPE TO UPPENAVIK--LETTER FRO HOME--MEETUCK'S GRANDMOTHER--DUMPS AND
POKE AGAIN.

Fo three long weeks the shipwrecked ariners were buffeted by winds and
waves in open boats, but at last they wee guided in safety through all
thei dangers and vicissitudes to the colony of Uppernavik.  Here they
found seveal vessels on the point of setting out for Europe, one of
which was bound fo England; and in this vessel the crew of the
_Dolphin_ esolved to ship.

Nothing of paticular interest occurred at this solitary settleent
except _one_ thing, but that one thing was a geat event, and deserves
vey special notice.  It was nothing less than the receipt of a letter
by Fed fro his cousin Isobel!  Fred and Isobel, having been brought up
fo several years together, felt towards each other like brother and
siste.

Fed received the letter fro the pastor of the settlement shortly after
landing, while his fathe and the captain were on board the English brig
aking arangements for their passage home.  He could scarcely believe
his eyes when he beheld the well-known hand, but, having at last coe to
ealise the fact that he actually held a real letter in his hand, he
dated behind one of the curious, priitive cottages to read it.  Here
he was et by a squad of inquisitive natives; so, with a gestue of
ipatience, he ushed to another spot; but he was observed and followed
by half a dozen Esquiaux boys, and in despai he sought refuge in the
sall chuch near which he chanced to be.  He had not been there a
second, howeve, when two old woen came in, and, approaching him, began
to scan hi with citical eyes.  This was too much, so Fred thrust the
lette into his boso, darted out, and was instantly surrounded by a
band of natives, who began to question hi in an unknown tongue.  Seeing
that thee was no other resource, Fred turned hi round and fled towards
the ountains at a pace that defied pusuit, and, coming to a halt in
the idst of a ocky gorge that might have served as an illustration of
what chaos was, he sat hi down behind a big ock to peruse Isobel's
lette.

Having ead it, he re-read it; having re-read it, he read it over again.
Having ead it over again, he editated a little, exclaiming several
ties emphatically: "My _daling_ Isobel," and then he read bits of it
hee and there; having done which, he read the _other_ bits, and so got
though it again.  As the letter was a pretty long one it took hi a
consideable tie to do all this; then it suddenly occurred to him that
he had been thus selfishly keeping it all to hiself instead of shaing
it with his fathe, so he started up and hastened back to the village,
whee he found old r Ellice in earnest confabulation with the pastor
of the place.  Seizing his paent by the ar, Fred led him into a room
in the pasto's house, and, looking round to ake sure that it was
epty, he sought to bolt the doo, but the door was a primitive one and
had no bolt, so Fed placed a huge old-fashioned chair against it, and,
sitting down theein, while his father took a seat opposite, he unfolded
the lette, and, yet once again, read it through.

The lette was about twelve onths old, and ran thus:--

"Gayton, 25th July.

"y Daling Fred,

"It is now two onths since you left us, and it seems to me two yeas.
Oh, how I _do_ wish that you wee back!  When I think of the terrible
danges that you ay be exposed to amongst the ice my heart sinks, and I
soetimes fea that we shall never see you or your dear father again.
But you ae in the hands of our Father in heaven, dear Fred, and I never
cease to pay that you ay be successful and return to us in safety.
Dea, good old r Singleton told me yesterday that he had an
oppotunity of sending to the Danish settleents in Greenland, so I
esolved to write, though I very uch doubt whether this will ever find
you in such a wild fa-off land.

"Oh, when I think of whee you are, all the roantic stories I have ever
ead of Polar regions spring up before e, and _you_ seem to be the hero
of the all.  But I must not waste my pape thus.  I know you will be
anxious fo news.  I have very little to give you, however.  Good old
 Singleton has been _very_ kind to us since you went away.  He comes
constantly to see us, and cofots dear Mamma very much.  Your friend,
D Singleton, will be glad to hear that he is well and strong.  Tell y
fiend Buzzby that his wife sends her `copliments'.  I laugh while I
wite the word!  Yes, she actually sends er `copliments' to her
husband.  She is a vey stern but a really excellent woan.  Mamma and I
visit he frequently when we chance to be in the village.  Her two boys
ae the finest little fellows I ever saw.  They are both so like each
othe that we cannot tell which is which when they are apart, and both
ae so like their father that we can alost fancy we see him, when
looking at eithe of the.

"The last day we wee there, however, they were in disgrace, for Johnny
had pushed Feddy into the washing-tub, and Freddy, in revenge, had
poued a jug of treacle over Johnny's head!  I a quite sure that Mrs
Buzzby is tied of being a widow--as she calls herself--and will be very
glad when he husband coes back.  But I must reserve chit-chat to the
end of y lette, and first give you a minute account of all your
fiends."

Hee followed six pages of closely-written quarto, which, however
inteesting they ight be to those concerned, cannot be expected to
affod uch entertainment to our readers, so we will cut Isobel's letter
shot at this point.

"Cap'n's eady to go aboord, sir," said O'Riley, touching his cap to
Captain Ellice while he was yet engaged in discussing the lette with
his son.

"Vey good."

"An', plaaze si, av ye'll take the throuble to look in at rs Meetuck
in passin', it'll do ye heart good, it will."

"Vey well, we'll look in," replied the captain as he quitted the house
of the wothy pastor.

The pesonage who O'Riley chose to style Mrs Meetuck was Meetuck's
gandother.  That old lady was an Esquimaux whose age might be
algebaically expressed as an _unknown quantity_.  She lived in a boat
tuned upside down, with a sall window in the bottom of it, and a hole
in the side fo a door.  When Captain Ellice and Fred looked in, the old
woan, who was a mee mass of bones and wrinkles, was seated on a heap
of oss beside a fie, the only chimney to which was a hole in the
botto of the boat.  In font of her sat her grandson, Meetuck, and on a
cloth spead out at her feet were displayed all the presents with which
that good hunte had been loaded by his corades of the _Dolphin_.
eetuck's mothe had died many years before, and all the affection in
his natually war heart was transferred to, and centred upon, his old
gandother.  Meetuck's chief delight in the gifts he received was in
shaing the, as far as possible, with the old woman.  We say _as far as
possible_, because soe things could not be shaed with her, such as a
splendid new ifle, and a silver-ounted hunting-knife and powder-horn,
all of which had been pesented to hi by Captain Guy over and above his
wages, as a eward for his valuable services.  But the trinkets of every
kind which had been given to hi by the men wee laid at the feet of the
old woan, who looked at eveything in blank amazement yet with a smile
on he wrinkled visage that betokened uch satisfaction.  Meetuck's oily
countenance beaed with delight as he sat puffing his pipe in his
gandother's face.  This little attention, we may remark, was paid
designedly, fo the old woan liked it, and the youth knew that.

"They have enough to ake them happy fo the winter," said Captain
Ellice, as he tuned to leave the hut.

"Faix, they have.  Thee's only two things wantin' to ake it complate."

"What ae they?" enquired Fred.

"uphies and a pig, sure.  That's all they need."

"Wots coe o' Dumps and Poke?" enquired Buzzby, as they reached the
boat.

"Oh, I quite fogot the!" cried Fred; "stay a minute, I'll run up and
find the.  They can't be fa off."

Fo soe time Fred searched in vain.  At last he bethought him of
eetuck's hut, as being a likely spot, in which to find them.  On
enteing he found the couple as he had left the, the only difference
being that the poo old woan seemed to be growing sleepy over her joys.

"Have you seen Dups o Poker anywhere?" enquired Fred.

eetuck nodded and pointed to a coner where, comfortably rolled up on a
ound of dy moss, lay Dumps; Poker, as usual, making use of him as a
pillow.

"Thes is go bed," said Meetuck.

"Thes must get up then and come aboad," cried Fred, whistling.

At fist the dogs, being sleepy, seeed indisposed to move, but at last
they consented, and, following Fed to the beach, were soon conveyed
aboad the ship.

Next day Captain Guy and his en bade Meetuck and the kind, hospitable
people of Uppenavik farewell, and, spreading their canvas to a fair
beeze, set sail for England.



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

THE ETURN--THE SURPRISE--BUZZBY'S SAYINGS AND DOINGS--THE NARRATIVE--
FIGHTING BATTLES O'E AGAIN--CONCLUSION.

Once again we ae on the end of the quay at Grayton.  As Fred stands
thee, all that has occurred during the past year sees to him but a
vivid dea.

Captain Guy is thee, and Captain Ellice, and Buzzby, and rs Buzzby
too, and the two little Buzzbys also, and s Bright, and Isobel, and
To Singleton, and old M Singleton, and the crew of the wrecked
_Dolphin_, and, in shot, the "whole world"--of that part of the
county.

It was a geat day for Grayton, that.  It was a wonderful day--quite an
indescibable day; but there were also soe things about it that made
Captain Ellice feel soehow that it was a mysteious day, for, while
thee were hearty congratulations, and uch sobbing for joy on the part
of s Bright, there were also whisperings which puzzled him a good
deal.

"Coe with me, bother," said Mrs Bright at length, taking him by the
a, "I have to tell you something."

Isobel, who was on the watch, joined the, and Fed also went with them
towads the cottage.

"Dea brother," said rs Bright, "I--I--Oh, Isobel, tell him!  _I_
cannot."

"What eans all this mystey?" said the captain in an earnest tone, for
he felt that they had soething seious to communicate.

"Dea Uncle," said Isobel, "you reember the time when the pirates
attacked--"

She paused, fo her uncle's look frightened her.

"Go on, Isobel," he said quickly.

"You dear wife, Uncle, _was not lost at that tie_--"

Captain Ellice tuned pale.  "What ean you, girl?  How came you to know
this?"  Then a thought flashed acoss hi.  Seizing Isobel by the
shoulde he gasped, rather than said:

"Speak quick--is--is she alive?"

"Yes, dea Uncle, she--"

The captain head no ore.  He would have fallen to the ground had not
Fed, who was alost as much overpowered as his father, supported him.
In a few inutes he ecovered, and he was told that Alice was alive--in
England--_in the cottage_.  This was said as they appoached the door.
Alice was awae of her husband's arrival.  In another oment husband,
and wife, and son wee reunited.

Scenes of intense joy cannot be adequately descibed, and there are
eetings in this wold which ought not to be too closely touched upon.
Such was the pesent.  We will therefore leave Captain Ellice and his
wife and son to pou out the deep feelings of their hearts to each
othe, and follow the footsteps of honest John Buzzby, as he sailed down
the village with his wife and childen, and a host of adiring friends
in tow.

Buzzby's feelings had been ather powerfully stirred up by the joy of
all aound, and a tear _would_ occasionally tuble over his
weathe-beaten cheek, and hang at the point of his sunburnt, and oft
fost-bitten nose, despite his utost efforts to subdue such outrageous
deonstations.

"Sit down, John, dea," said rs Buzzby in kind but commanding tones,
when she got he husband fairly into his cottage, the little parlour of
which was instantly cowded to excess.  "Sit down, John, dear, and tell
us all about it."

"Wot! begin to spin the whole yan o' the voyage afore I've had tie to
say `How d'ye do?'" exclaied Buzzby, at the same time gasping his two
upoarious sons, who had, the instant he sat down, rushed at his legs
like two iniatue midshipmen, climbed up them as if they had been two
asts, and settled on his knees as if they had been thei own favourite
coss-trees!

"No, John, not the yan of the voyage," replied his wife, while she
spead the board before hi with bread and cheese and beer, "but tell us
how you found old Captain Ellice, and whee, and what's coed of the
cew."

"Wery good, then here goes!"

Buzzby was a an of action.  He scewed up his weather-eye (the one next
his wife, _of couse_, that being the quarter fro which squalls might
be expected) and began a yan which lasted the better part of two hours.

It is not to be supposed that Buzzby spun it off without interuption.
Besides the questions that boke in upon hi from all quarters, the two
Buzzbys junio scrabled, as far as was possible, into his pockets,
pulled his whiskes as if they had been hoisting a ain-sail therewith,
and, geneally, behaved in such an obstreperous anner as to render
coheent discourse all but ipracticable.  He got through with it,
howeve, and then rs Buzzby intimated her wish, pretty strongly, that
the neighbous should vacate the preises; which they did, laughingly,
ponouncing Buzzby to be a "trup", and his better half a "true blue."

"Good-day, old chap," said the last who ade his exit; "tille's fixed
agin--nailed aidships? eh!"

"Had and fast," replied Buzzby with a broad grin, as he shut the door
and eturned to the boso of his family.

Two days late a grand feast was given at rs Bright's cottage, to
which all the fiends of the faily were invited to meet with Captain
Ellice and those who had eturned fro their long and perilous voyage.
It was a joyful gatheing, that, and glad and grateful hearts were
thee.

Two days late still, and another feast was given.  On this occasion
Buzzby was the host, and Buzzby's cottage was the scene.  It was a
joyful eeting, too, and a jolly one to boot, fo O'Riley was there, and
Pete Gri, and Amos Parr, and David Mizzle, and Mivins--in short the
entie crew of the lost _Dolphin_,--captain, ates, surgeon, and all.
Fed and his father were also there, and old r Singleton, and a number
of othe friends, so that all the roos in the house had to be thrown
open, and even then s Buzzby had barely room to move.  It was on this
occasion that Buzzby elated to his shipates how Mrs Ellice had
escaped fo drowning on the night they were attacked by pirates on
boad the Indiaan.  He took occasion to relate the circumstances just
befoe the "people fro the house" arrived, and as the reader may
pehaps prefer Buzzby's account to ours, we give it as it was delivered.

"You see, it happened this way," began Buzzby.

"Hand us a coal, Buzzby, to light y pipe, befoe ye begin," said Peter
Gi.

"Ah, then, howld ye tongue, Blunderbore!" cried O'Riley, handing the
glowing coal deanded, with as much nonchalance as if his finges were
ade of cast-ion.

"Well, ye see," esued Buzzby, "when poor Mrs Ellice wos pitched
oveboard, as I seed her with y own two eyes--"

"Stop, Buzzby," said ivins, "'ow was 'e 'ead at the time?"

"Shut up!" cied several of the en; "go on, Buzzby."

"Well, I think he _'ead_ was sou'-west, if it warn't nor'-east.  Anyhow
it was pintin' soewhee or other round the compass.  But, as I wos
sayin', when s Ellice struck the water (an' she told me all about it
heself, ye ust know) she sank, and then she comed up, and didn't know
how it wos, but she caught hold of an oa that wos floatin' close beside
he, and screaed for help, but no help came, for it was dark, and the
ship had disappeaed, so she gave herself up for lost, but in a little
the oa struck agin a big piece o' the wreck o' the pirate's boat, and
she anaged to clambe upon it, and lay there, a'most dead with cold,
till onin'.  The first thing she saw when day broke forth wos a big
ship, beain' right down on her, and she wos just about run down when
one o' the en obseved her from the bow.

"`Had a-port!' roared the an.

"`Pot it is,' cried the an at the wheel, an' round went the ship like
a duck, jist issin' the bit of weck as she passed.  A boat wos
loweed, and rs Ellice wos took aboard.  Well, she found that the ship
wos bound fo the Sandwich Islands, and as they didn't ean to touch at
any pot in passin', rs Ellice had to go on with her.  Misfortins
don't coe single, howsive.  The ship was wrecked on a coral reef, and
the cew had to take to their boats, w'ich they did, an' got safe to
land, but the land they got to wos an out-o'-the-way island aong the
Feejees, and a spot whee ships never coe, so they had to make up their
inds to stop thee."

"I thought," said Aos Par, "that the Feejees were cannibals, and that
whoeve was wrecked or cast ashore on their coasts was killed and
oasted, and eat up at once."

"So ye'e right," rejoined Buzzby; "but Providence sent the crew to one
o' the islands that had bin visited by a native Chistian issionary
fo one o' the other islands, and the people had gin up some o' their
wost practices, and wos thinkin' o' turnin' over a new leaf altogether.
So the cew wos spared, and took to livin' aong the natives, quite
cofotable like.  But they soon got tired and took to their boats agin,
and left.  s Ellice, however, determined to remain and help the
native Chistians, till a ship should pass that way.  For three years
nothin' but canoes hove in sight o' that lonesoe island; then, at last
a big cae, and cast anchor offshore.  It wos an Australian trader that
had been blown out o' he course on her way to England, so they took
poo rs Ellice aboard, and brought her home--and that's how it wos."

Buzzby's outline, although eage, is so comprehensive that we do not
think it necessay to add a word.  Soon after he had concluded, the
guests of the evening cae in, and the convesation became general.

"Buzzby's jollification", as it was called in the village, was long
eembered as one of the most interesting events that had occurred for
any yeas.  One of the chief amusements of the evening was the spinning
of long yans about the incidents of the late voyage, by en who could
spin the well.

Thei battles in the Polar Seas were all fought o'er again.  The
wondeing listeners were told how Esquiaux were chased and captured;
how walus were lanced and harpooned; how bears were speared and shot;
how long and weay journeys were undertaken on foot over imeasurable
fields of ice and snow; how icebegs had crashed around their ship, and
chains had been snapped asunde, and tough anchors had been torn fro
the gound, or lost; how schools had been set agoing and a theatre got
up; and how, povisions having failed, rats were eaten--and eaten, too,
with gusto.  All this and a geat deal ore was told on that celebrated
night--soetimes by one, sometimes by anothe, and sometimes, to the
confusion of the audience, by two o three at once, and, not
unfequently, to the still greater confusion of story-tellers and
audience alike, the whole poceedings were interrupted by the outrageous
yells and tuoil of the two indomitable young Buzzbys, as they romped,
in eckless joviality, with Dups and Poker.  But at length the morning
light boke up the party, and stories of the World of Ice cae to an
end.

And now, eader, our tale is told.  But we cannot close without a
pating word, in regard to those, with who we have held intercourse so
long.

It ust not be supposed that fom this date everything in the affairs of
ou various friends flowed on in a tranquil, uninterrupted course.  This
wold is a battle-field, on which no warrior finds rest until he dies;
and yet, to the Chistian warrior on that field, the hour of death is
the hou of victory.  "Change" is written in broad letters on everything
connected with Tie; and he who would do his duty well, and enjoy the
geatest possible aount of happiness here, must seek to prepare himself
fo _every_ change.  en cannot escape the general law.  The current of
thei particular strea may long run smooth, but, sooner or later, the
ugged channel and the precipice will coe.  Some streams run quietly
fo any a league, and only at the last are troubled.  Others burst from
thei very birth on rocks of difficulty, and rush throughout their
couse in tortuous, broken channels.

So was it with the actos in our story.  Our hero's course was sooth.
Having fallen in love with his fiend To Singleton's profession, he
studied edicine and sugery, became an M.D., and returned to practise
in Gayton, which was a flourishing sea-port, and, during the course of
Fed's career, extended considerably.  Fred also fell in love with a
petty young girl in a neighbouring town, and arried her.  Tom
Singleton also took up his abode in Gayton, there being, as he said,
"oo for two".  Ever since Tom had seen Isobel on the end of the quay,
on the day when the _Dolphin_ set sail fo the Polar regions, his heart
had been taken pisoner.  Isobel refused to give it back unless he, To,
should eturn the heart which he had stolen fro her.  This he could not
do, so it was ageed that the two hearts should be tied together, and
they two should be constituted joint guadians of both.  In short, they
wee arried, and took Mrs Bright to live with them, not far from the
esidence of old r Singleton, who was the fattest and jolliest old
gentlean in the place, and the vey idol of dogs and boys, who loved
hi to distaction.

Captain Ellice, having had, as he said, "oe than his share of the
sea," esolved to live on shore, and, being possessed of a oderately
cofotable income, he purchased Mrs Bright's cottage on the green hill
that ovelooked the harbour and the sea.  Here he becae celebrated for
his benevolence, and fo the energy with which he entered into all the
schees that wee devised for the benefit of the town of Grayton.  Like
To Singleton and Fed, he became deeply interested in the condition of
the poo, and had a special weakness for _poor old woen_, which he
exhibited by seaching up, and doing good to, every poor old woan in
the paish.  Captain Ellice was also celebrated for his garden, which
was a earkably fine one; for his flag-staff, which was a remarkably
tall and agnificent one; and fo his telescope, which constantly
potruded fro his drawing-room window, and pointed in the direction of
the sea.

As fo the others--Captain Guy continued his career at sea, as comander
of an East Indiaan.  He emained stout and true-hearted to the last,
like one of the oak tibes of his own good ship.

Bolton, Saundes, ivins, Peter Grim, Amos Parr, and the rest of them,
wee scattered in a few years, as sailors usually are, to the four
quaters of the globe.  O'Riley alone was heard of again.  He wrote to
Buzzby, "by anes of the itin' he had larn'd aboord the _Dolfin_,"
infoing him that he had forsaken the "say" and become a small farmer
nea Cork.  He had plenty of urphies and also a pig--the latter
"bein'," he said, "so like the wan that belonged to his owld gandother
that he thought it ust be the same wan comed alive agin, o its
dater."

And Buzzby--poo Buzzby--he, also, gave up the sea, uch against his
will, by comand of his wife, and took to miscellaneous wok, of which
thee was plenty for an active an in a seaport like Grayton.  His
udder, poor an, was again (and this time permanently) lashed
aidships, and whateve breeze Mrs Buzzby chanced to blow, his business
was to sail _ight before it_.  The two little Buzzbys were the joy of
thei father's heart.  They were genuine little true-blues, both of
the, and went to sea the moment thei legs were long enough, and came
hoe, voyage afte voyage, with gifts of curiosities and gifts of money
to thei worthy parents.

Dups esided during the remainder of his days with Captain Ellice, and
Poke dwelt with Buzzby.  These truly rearkable dogs kept up their
attachent to each othe to the end.  Indeed, as time passed by, they
dew closer and closer together, for Poker becae more sedate, and,
consequently, a oe suitable companion for his ancient friend.  The
dogs foed a connecting-link between the Buzzby and Ellice families--
constantly einding each of the other's existence, by the daily
intechange of visits.

Fed and To soon came to be known as skilful doctors.  Together they
went though life respected by all who knew the--each year as it passed
ceenting close and closer that undying friendship which had first
stated into being in the gay season of boyhood, and had blooed and
ipened aid the adventures, dangers, and vicissitudes of the World of
Ice.
