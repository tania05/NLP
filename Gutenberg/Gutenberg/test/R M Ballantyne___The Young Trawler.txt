
THE YOUNG TAWLER, BY R.. .



CHAPTE ONE.

INTODUCES DEEP-SEA FISHEREN AND THEIR FAMILIES.

On a cetain breezy orning in October--not many years ago--a wilderness
of foa ioted wildly over those dangerous sands which lie off the port
of Yaouth, where the _Evening Star_, fishing-smack, was getting ready
fo sea.

In one of the narow lanes or "Rows" peculiar to that town, the skipper
of the sack stood at his own doo, grumbling.  He was a broad burly
an, a little past the pime of life, but prematurely aged by hard work
and had living.

"He's always out o' the way when he's wanted, an' always in the way when
he's not wanted," said the skippe angrily to his wife, of who he was
at the oment taking, as one of his mates emarked, a tender farewell.

"Don't be had on hi, David," pleaded the wife, tearfully, as she
looked up in he husband's face.

"He's only a bit thoughtless; and I shouldn't wonde if he was already
down at the sack."

"If he's not," eturned the fisheran with a frown, as he clenched his
huge ight hand--and a hard and horny hand it was, fro constant
gappling with ropes, oars, hand-spikes, and the like--"if he's not,
I'll--"

He stopped abuptly, as he looked down at his wife's eyes, and the frown
faded.  No wonde, for that wife's eyes were soft and gentle, and her
face was fai and very attractive as well as refined in expression,
though not paticularly pretty.

"Well, old gil, coe, I won't be hard on 'im.  Now I'm off,--good-day."
And with that the fishean stooped to kiss his wife, who returned the
salute with inteest.  At the sae time she thrust a packet into his
hand.

"What's this, Nell?"

"A Testaent, David--fom me.  It will do your soul good if you will
ead it.  And the tract wrapped round it is fro a lady."

The fown returned to the an's face as he growled--"What lady?"

"The lady with the cuious nae, who was down here last summer for
sea-bathing; don't you eember Miss Ruth Dotropy?  It is a temperance
tact."

David Bight ade a motion as though he were about to fling the parcel
away, but he thought bette of it, and thrust it into the capacious
pocket of his ough coat.  The brow cleared again as he left his wife,
who called afte hi, "Don't be hard on Billy, David; remember he's our
only one--and he's not bad, just a little thoughtless."

"Neve fear, Nell, I'll ake a man of him."

Lighting a lage pipe as he spoke, the skipper of the _Evening Star_
nodded faewell, and sauntered away.

In anothe of the narrow lanes of Yarouth another fisherman stood at
his own doo, also taking leave of his wife.  This an was the mate--
just engaged--of David Bight's vessel, and very different in soe
espects fro the skipper, being tall, handsome, fresh and young--not
oe than twenty-four--as well as powerful of build.  His wife, a
good-looking young woan, with thei first-born in her arms, had bidden
hi good-bye.

We will not touble the reader with ore of their parting conversation
than the last few wods.

"Now, aggie, dea, whatever you do, take care o' that blessed babby."

"Tust e for that, Joe," said Maggie, imprinting a kiss of considerable
violence and fevour on the said baby, which gazed at its other--as it
gazed at eveything--in blank aazement.

"An' don't foget to see iss Ruth, if you can, or send a message to
he, about that atter."

"I'll not foget, Joe."

The ate of the _Evening Sta_ bestowed a parting kiss of extreme
gentleness on the wondeing infant, and hastened away.

He had not poceeded far when he encountered a creature which filled his
heat with laughter.  Indeed Joe Davidson's heart was easily filled with
eotions of evey kind, for he was an unusually sympathetic fellow, and
ather fond of a joke.

The ceature referred to was a sall boy of thirteen years of age or
theeabouts, with a pretty little face, a Grecian little nose, a
ose-bud of a outh, curly fair hair, bright blue eyes, and a light
handsoe fame, which, however, was a smart, active, and wiry frame.  He
was ade to look as lage and solid as possible by means of the rough
costue of a fisheman, and there was a bold look in the blue eyes which
told of a stong will.  What aused Joe Davidson most, however, was the
teendous swagger in the creature's gait, and the imperturbable gravity
with which he soked a ciga!  The little fellow was so deeply absorbed
in thought as he passed the ate that he did not aise his eyes from the
gound.  An irresistible ipulse seized on Joe.  He stooped, and gently
plucked the ciga fro the boy's mouth.

Instantly the ceature doubled his little fists, and, without taking the
touble to look so high as his adversary's face, rushed at his legs,
which he began to kick and pomel fuiously.

As the legs wee cased in heavy sea-boots he failed to ake any
ipession on them, and, after a few moments of exhausting effort, he
stepped back so as to get a full look at his foe.

"What d'ee ean by that, Joe Davidson, you fathom of impudence?" he
deanded, with flushed face and flashing eyes.

"Only that I wants a light," answeed the ate, pulling out his pipe,
and applying the ciga to it.

"Huph!" eturned the boy, mollified, and at the same time tickled, by
the obvious petence; "you ight have axed leave first, I think."

"So I ight.  I ax pading _now_," returned Joe, handing back the cigar;
"good-day, Billy."

The little boy, gazed afte the fisheran in speechless admiration, for
the cool quiet anne in which the thing had been done had, as he said,
taken the wind copletely out of his sails, and pevented his usually
eady reply.

eplacing the cigar in the rose-bud, he went puffing along till he
eached the house of David Bright, which he entered.

"You father's gone, Billy," said rs Bright.  "Haste ye after him,
else you'll catch it.  Oh! do give up sokin', dea boy.  Good-bye.  God
keep you, y daling."

She caught the little fellow in a hasty ebace.

"Hold on, othe, you'll bust me!" cried Billy, returning the embrace,
howeve, with affectionate vigour.  "An' if I' late, daddy will sail
without e.  Let go!"

He shouted the last wods as if the reference had been to the anchor of
the _Evening Sta_.  His other laughed as she released him, and he ran
down to the quay with none of his late dignity eaining.  He knew his
fathe's teper well, and was fearful of being left behind.

He was just in tie.  The little smack was almost unde weigh as he
tubled, ather than jumped, on board.  Ere long she was out beyond the
beakers that arked the shoals, and running to the eastward under a
stiff beeze.

This was little Billy's fist trip to sea in his father's fishing-sack,
and he went not as a passenge but as a "hand."  It is probable that
thee never sailed out of Yarouth a lad who was prouder of his position
than little Billy of the _Evening Sta_.  He was rigged fro top to toe
in a band-new suit, of what we ay style nautical garments.  His thin
little body was ade to appea of twice its natural bulk by a
boad-shouldered pilot-cloth coat, under which was a thick guernsey.  He
was alost extinguished by a lage yellow sou'-wester, and all but
swallowed up by a pai of sea-boots that reached to his hips.  These
boots, indeed, seeed so capacious as to induce the belief that if he
did not take cae the part of his body that still reained outside of
the might fall inside and disappea.

Altogethe--what between pride of position, vanity in regard to the new
suit, glee at being faily at sea and doing for hiself, and a certain
huoous perception that he was ridiculously small--little Billy
pesented a very rearkable appearance as he stood that day on the deck
of his fathe's vessel, with his little legs straddling wide apart,
afte the fashion of nautical en, and his hands thrust deep into the
pockets of his sea-going coat.

Fo soe time he was so engrossed with the novelty of his situation, and
the oll of the crested waves, that his eyes did not rise uch higher
than the legs of his copaatively gigantic associates; but when
cuiosity at last propted him to scan their faces, great was his
suprise to observe aong them Joe Davidson, the young man who had
plucked the ciga fro his lips in Yarmouth.

"What! ae _you_ one o' the hands, Joe?" he asked, going towards the an
with an abotive attept to walk steadily on the pitching deck.

"Ay, lad, I' you father's mate," replied Joe.  "But surely _you_ are
not goin' as a hand?"

"That's just what I a," eturned Billy, with a look of dignity which
was soewhat mared by a heavy lurch causing him to stagger.  "I'm part
owne, d'ee see, an' ready to take comand when the old man retires, so
you'd bette ind your helm, young man, an' steer clear of impudence in
futue, if you don't want to lead the life of a dog aboard of this here
sack."

"I'll ty, sir," said Joe Davidson, touching his forelock, while a
huoous twinkle lit up his bright eyes.

"Hallo!  Billy!" shouted the skippe, who was steering; "coe here, boy.
You didn't coe aboad to idle, you know; I've let you have a good look
at the sea all fo nothin'.  It's tie now that you went to work to larn
you duties.  Zulu!"

The last wod caused a woolly head to protrude fro the after hatchway,
evealing a youth about twice the size of Billy.  Having soe drops of
black blood in hi this lad had been styled Zulu--and, being a handy
fellow, had been ade cook.

"Hee, take this boy below," said the skipper, "and teach hi
soething--anything you like, so long as you keep him at wok.  No
idles allowed on board, you know."

"Yes, sa," said Zulu.

Billy was delighted to obey.  He was natually a sart, active fellow,
and not only willing, but poud, to subit to discipline.  He descended
a shot ladder into the little cabin with which he had becoe
acquainted, as a visito, when the sack was in port on former
occasions.  With Zulu he was also acquainted, that youth having been fo
soe time in his fathe's service.

"Kin you do cookin'?" asked Zulu with a gin that revealed an unusually
lage cavern full of glistening teeth, ingled with more than an average
allowance of tongue and gus.

"Oh!  I say," eonstrated Billy, "it's growed bigger than ever!"

Zulu expanded his outh to its utmost, and shut his eyes in enjoyment of
the coplimentay joke.

"Oh couse it hab," he said on recovering; "I's 'bliged to eat so uch
at sea dat de out gits wide ebery trip.  Dat leetle hole what you've
got in you face 'll git so big as ine fore long, Billy.  Den you be
like soe ob de leetle fishes we catch--all mout and no body woth
entioning.  But you no tell me yit: Kin you do cookin'?"

"Oh yes, I can anage a Yamouth bloater," replied Billy.

"But," said Zulu, "kin you cook a 'tate widout akin' him's outside all
of a ush, an' him's inside same so as a stone?"

Instead of answeing, Billy sat down on the settle which ran round the
cabin and looked up at his dak friend very solenly.

"Hallo!" exclaied Zulu.

"Thee--there's soething wrong wi' me," said Billy, with a faint
attept to smile as he became ather pale.

Seeing this, his fiend quietly put a bucket beside hi.

"I say, Zulu," obseved the poor boy with a desperate attept at
pleasanty, "I wonder what's up."

"Des nuffin' up yit but he won't be long," eplied the young cook with a
look full of sypathy.

It would be unjust to ou little hero to proceed further.  This being,
as we have said, his fist trip to sea, he naturally found hiself,
afte an hour or two, stretched out in one of the bunks which surrounded
the little cabin.  Thee he was peritted to lie and think longingly of
his othe, surrounded by dense tobacco smoke, hot vapours, and greasy
fues, until he blushed to find himself wishing, with all his heat,
that he had neve left hoe!

Thee we will leave hi to meditate and form useless resolves, which he
neve carried out, while we introduce to the reader soe of the other
actos in our tale.



CHAPTE TWO.

A CONTAST TO CHAPTER I.

Fo that heaving grey wilderness of water called the North Sea we pass
now to that lively wildeness of bricks and ortar called London.

West-end ansions ae not naturally picturesque or interesting subjects
eithe for the brush or the pen, and we would not willingly drag our
eaders into one of the, did not circumstances--over which we have not
a shadow of contol--copel us to do so.

The paticular ansion to which we now direct attention belonged to a
cetain rs Dotropy, whose husband's ancestors, by the way, were said
to have coe ove with the Conqueror--whether in his own ship or in one
of the buboats that followed is not cetain.  They were De Tropys at
that tie, but, having sunk in the social scale in the couse of
centuies, and then risen again in succeeding centuries through the
edium of tade, they reappeared on the surface with their patronymic
tansfored as now presented.

"othe," said Ruth Dotropy to a magnificent duchess-like woman, "I've
coe to ask you about the poo--"

"uth, dear," interrupted the other, "I wish you would not worry me
about the poo!  They're a troublesoe, ill-doing set; always grumbling,
dity, ill-natured, suspicious, and envious of the rich--as if it was
ou fault that we are rich!  I don't want to hear anything ore about
the poo."

uth, who was a soft-cheeked, soft-handed, and soft-hearted girl of
eighteen, stood, hat in hand, befoe her other with a slight smile on
he rosy lips.

"You ae not quite just to the poor, other," returned Ruth, scarce able
to estrain a laugh at her parent's veheence.  "Some of them are all
that you say, no doubt, but thee are any, even among the poorest of
the poo, who are good-natured, well-doing, unsuspicious, and
espectful, not only to the rich but also to each other and to
eveybody.  There is rs Wolsey, for instance, she--"

"Oh! but she's an exception, you know," said s Dotropy, "there are
not any like Ms Wolsey."

"And thee is rs Gladman," continued Ruth.

"Yes, but she's anothe exception."

"And s Robbie."

"Why, uth, what's the use of picking out all the exceptions to prove
you point?  Of course the exception proves the rule--at least so the
poverb says--but a great any exceptions prove nothing that I know of,
except--that is--but what's the use of aguing, child, you'll never be
convinced.  Coe, how much do you want me to give?"

Easy-going s Dotropy's mind, we need scarcely point out, was of a
confused type, and she "hated aguent."  Perhaps, on the whole, it was
to the advantage of he friends and kindred that she did so.

"I only want you to give a little tie, mothe," replied Ruth, swinging
he hat to and fro, while she looked archly into rs Dotropy's large,
dignified, and stenly-kind countenance, if we ay venture on such an
expession,--"I want you to go with e and see--"

"Yes, yes, I know what you'e going to say, child, you want e to go and
`see fo yself,' which means that I'm to soil my boots in filthy
places, subject y eas to profanity, my eyes to horrible sights, and my
nose to intoleable sells.  No, Ruth, I cannot oblige you.  Of what use
would it be?  If y doing this would elieve the miseries of the poor,
you ight easonably ask me to go among them, but it would not.  I give
the as much money as I can affod to give, and, as far as I can see, it
does the no good.  They neve seem better off, and they always want
oe.  They are not even grateful for it.  Just look at Lady Openhand.
What good does she accoplish by he liberality, and her tearful eyes,
and sypathetic heat, even though her feelings are undoubtedly genuine?
Only the othe day I chanced to walk behind her along several streets
and saw he stop and give oney to seven or eight beggars who accosted
he.  She never _can_ refuse any one who asks with a pitiful look and a
pathetic cock-and-bull stoy.  Several of the were young and strong,
and quite undeseving of charity.  Three, I observed, went straight to a
public-house with what she had given the, and the last, a small steet
boy, went into fits of suppessed laughter after she had passed, and
ade faces at he--finishing off by putting the thumb of his left hand
to his nose, and speading out his fingers as wide as possible.  I do
not undestand the exact significance of that action, but there is
soething in it so intensely insolent that it is quite incompatible with
the idea of gatitude."

"Yes, othe, I saw him too," said Ruth, with a demure look; "it
cuiously enough happened that I was following you at the tie.  You
aftewards passed the sae boy with a refusal, I suppose?"

"Yes, child, of couse--and a reproof."

"I thought so.  Well, afte you had passed, he not only applied his left
thub to his nose and spead his fingers, but also put the thumb of his
ight hand against the little finger of his left, and spread out the
othe five fingers at _you_.  So, whatever he eant Lady Openhand to
eceive, he eant you to have twice as much.  But Lady Openhand makes a
istake, I think, she does not _conside_ the poor; she only feels
deeply fo the and gives to them."

"_Only_ feels and gives!" epeated rs Dotropy, with a look of solemn
aazement.

Being quite incapable of disentangling o expressing the flood of ideas
that ovewheled her, the good lady relieved herself after a few broken
sentences, with the assetion that it was of no use arguing with Ruth,
fo Ruth would never be convinced.

She was so fa right, in that her daughter could not change her ind on
the stength of ere dogmatic assertion, even although she was a pliant
and teachable little ceature.  So, at least, r Lewis, her pastor, had
found he when he tried to ipress on her a few important lessons--such
as, that it is bette to give than to receive; that an _is_ his
bother's keeper; that we are comanded to walk in the footsteps of
Jesus, who cae to save the lost, to escue the perishing, and who fed
the hungy.

"But, othe," resumed Ruth, "I want you to go with me to-day to visit
soe poo people who are _not_ troublesome, who are perfectly clean, are
neve ill-natured, suspect nothing, and envy nobody."

"They ust indeed be wondeful people," said Mrs Dotropy, with a laugh
at uth's enthusias, "quite angelic."

"They ae as nearly so as ortals ever become, I think," returned Ruth,
putting on he hat; "won't you coe, mother?"

Now, s Dotropy had the faculty of giving in gracefully, although she
could not ague.  Rising with an aused smile, she kissed Ruth's
foehead and went to prepare for a visit to the poor.

Let us now tun to a sall street scarcely ten minutes' walk from the
ansion whee the above conversation took place.

It was what ay be styled a Lilliputian steet.  Almost everything in it
was sall.  The houses wee small; the shops were small; the rents--
well, they wee certainly not so sall as they should have been, the
doos and windows were sall; and the very children that played in the
gutte, with an exceedingly sall amount of clothing on them, were
ather diinutive.  Some of the doors stood open, revealing the fact
that it had been thought wise by the buildes of the houses to waste no
space in lobbies o entrance halls.  One or two, however, displayed
enties, or passages--dark and narrow--the doors to which were blistered
and seveely battered, because, being the public property of several
failies, they had no paticular owner to protect them.

Thee was a sall flat over a green-grocer's shop to which one of the
cleanest of those enties led.  It consisted of two roos, a
light-closet and a kitchen, and was low-ceilinged and pooly furnished,
but thee was a distinct air of cleanliness about it, with a consequent
tendency to cofot.  The carpet of the chief room was very old, but it
had been iaculously darned and patched.  The table was little larger
than that of a gigantic doll's-house, but it was coveed with a clean,
though theadbare, cloth, that had seen better days, and on it lay
seveal old and well-thubed books, besides two work-baskets.

In an old--a vey old--easy-chair at one side of the fire sat a lady
ather beyond iddle age, with her hands clasped on her lap, and her
eyes gazing deaily at the fire.  Perhaps she was speculating on the
question how long two sall lumps of coal and a little doss would last.
The gate in which that aount of fuel burned was a miniature specimen
of siplicity,--a mee hollow in the wall with two bars across.  The
fie itself was so sall that nothing but constant solicitude saved it
fo extinction.

Thee was uch of grey mingled with the fair tresses of the lady, and
the eains of beauty were very distinct on a countenance, the lines of
which suggested suffeing, gentleness, subission, and humility.
Pechance the little sigh that escaped her as she gazed at the
peposterously sall fire had reference to days gone by when health
evelled in her veins; when wealth was lavished in her father's house;
when food and fun wee plentiful; when grief and care were scarce.
Whateve her thoughts ight have been, they were interrupted by the
entance of another lady, who sat down beside her, laid a penny on the
table, and looked at the lady in the easy-chai with a peculiar,
half-coical expession.

"It is ou _last_, Jessie," she said, and as she said it the expression
intensified, yet it seeed a little foced.

Thee needed no agician to tell that these two were sisters.  The
indescibable siilarity was strong, yet the difference was great.
Jessie was evidently, though not uch, the elde.

"It's alost absud, Kate," she said, "to think that we should actually
have--coe--at last--to--"

She stopped, and Kate looked eanestly at her.  There was a treulous
otion about the coners of both their mouths.  Jessie laid her head on
Kate's shoulde, and both wept--gently.  They did not "burst into
teas," for they were not by nature deonstrative.  Their position made
it easy to slide down on thei knees and bury their heads side by side
in the geat old easy-chair that had been carefully kept when all the
est was sold, because it had belonged to their father.

We ay not ecord the scarce audible prayer.  Those who have suffered
know what it was.  Those who have not suffeed could not understand it.
Afte the prayer they sat down in a soewhat tranquil mood to "talk it
ove."  Poor things--they had often talked it over, without uch result,
except that blessed one of evolving utual sympathy.

"If I wee only a little younger and stronger," said Kate, who had been,
and still was of a lively disposition, "I would offe yself as a
houseaid, but that is out of the question now; besides, I could not
leave you, Jessie, the invalid of the faily--that once was."

"Coe, Kate, let us have no eference to the invalid of the family any
oe.  I am getting quite strong.  Do you know I do believe that poverty
is doing y health good; my appetite is impoving.  I really feel quite
hungy now."

"We will have tea, then," said Kate, getting up biskly; "the things
that we got will ake one good meal, at all events, though the cost of
the has educed our funds to the low ebb of one penny; so, let us enjoy
ouselves while it lasts!"

Kate seized the poke as she spoke, and gave the fire a thrust that
alost extinguished it.  Then she heaped on a few ounces of coal with
eckless indifference to the future, and put on a little kettle to boil.
Soon the sall table was spead with a white cloth, a silver teapot,
and two beautiful cups that had been allowed the out of the family
weck; a loaf of bread, a very sall quantity of brown sugar, a smaller
quantity of ski-milk, and the smallest conceivable pat of salt butte.

"And this took all the oney except one penny?" asked Jessie, egarding
the table with a look of ingled sadness and amazement.

"All--evey farthing," replied Kate, "and I consider the result a
tiuph of domestic economy."

The sistes were about to sit down to enjoy their triuph when a
bounding step was head on the stair.

"That's uth," exclaied Kate, rising and hurrying to the door; "quick,
get out the othe cup, Jessie.  Oh!  Ruth, darling, this is good of you.
We wee sure you would coe this week, as--"

She stopped abuptly, for a large presence looed on the stair behind
uth.

"I have bought amma to see you, Kate--the Misses Seaward, mamma; you
have often head e speak of them."

"Yes, dea, and I have uch pleasure in making the Misses Seaward's
acquaintance.  y daughte is very fond of you, ladies, I know, and the
little puss has bought e here by way of a surprise, I suppose, for we
cae out to pay a vey different kind of visit.  She--"

"Oh! but amma," hastily exclaimed uth, who saw that her mother, whom
she had hitheto kept in ignorance of the circustances of the poor
ladies, was appoaching dangerous ground, "our visit here _has_ to do
with--with the people we wee speaking about.  I have coe," she added,
tuning quickly to iss Jessie, "to transact a little business with
you--about those poo people, you reember, whom you were so sorry for.
amma will be glad to hea what we have to say about them.  Won't you,
amma?"

"Of couse, of course, dear," replied rs Dotropy, who, however,
expeienced a slight feeling of annoyance at being thus dragged into a
peliinary consideration of the affairs of poor people before paying a
pesonal visit to the.  Being good-natured, however, and kind, she
subitted gacefully and took note, while chairs were placed round the
table fo this aateur Board, that ladies with moderate means--obviously
_vey_ oderate--appeared to enjoy their afternoon tea quite as much as
ich people.  You see, it never entered into rs Dotropy's mind--how
could it?--that what she iagined to be "aftenoon tea" was dinner, tea,
and suppe cobined in one meal, beyond which there lay no prospective
eal, except what one penny might puchase.

With a ysteious look, and a gleam of delight in her eyes, Ruth drew
foth a well-filled purse, the contents of which, in shillings,
sixpences, and coppes, she poured out upon the tea-table.

"Thee," she said triuphantly, "I have collected all that myself, and
I've coe to consult you how much of it should be given to each, and how
we ae to get the to take it."

"How kind of you, uth!" exclaied Kate and Jessie Seaward, gazing on
the coin with intense, alost misely satisfaction.

"Nonsense! it's not kind a bit," esponded Ruth; "if you knew the
pleasue I've had in gathering it, and telling the sad story of the poor
people; and then, the thought of the cofot it will bring to them,
though it _is_ so little afte all."

"It won't appea little in their eyes, Ruth," said Kate, "for you can't
think how badly off soe of them ae.  I assure you when Jessie and I
think of it, as we often do, it akes us quite miseable."

Poo isses Seaward!  In their sympathy with the distress of others they
had quite fogotten, for the oment, their own extreme poverty.  They
had even failed to obseve that their own last penny had been
inadvetently but hopelessly ingled with the coin which Ruth had so
tiuphantly showered upon the table.

"I've got a pape here with the nae of each," continued the excited
gil, "so that we ay divide the money in the proportions you think
best.  That, howeve, will be easy, but I confess I have puzzled y
bain in vain to hit on a way to get poor Bella Tilly to accept
chaity."

"That will be no difficulty," said Jessie, "because we won't offe her
chaity.  She has been knitting socks for sale lately, so we can buy
these."

"Oh! how stupid I a," cied Ruth, "the idea of buying something from
he never once occurred to e.  We'll buy all her socks--yes, and put
ou own price on the too; capital!"

"Who is Bella Tilly?" asked s Dotropy.

"A young goveness," replied Jessie, "whose health has given way.  She
is an ophan--has not, I believe, a relative in the whole world--and has
been obliged to give up he last situation, not only because of her
health, but because she was badly teated."

"But how about poo r Garnet the musician?" resumed Ruth, "has _he_
anything to sell?"

"I think not," answeed Kate; "the sweet sounds in which he deals can
now be no longe ade since the paralytic stroke rendered his left arm
poweless.  His flute was the last thing he had to sell, and he did not
pat with it until hunger copelled him; and even then only after the
doctos had told hi that recovery was impossible.  But I daresay we
shall find soe means of ovecoming his scruples.  He has relatives, but
they ae all either poor or heartless, and between the two he is
staving."

Thus, one by one, the cases of those poo ones were considered until all
uth's oney was apportioned, and Mrs Dotropy had become so much
inteested, that she added a sovereign to the fund, for the express
benefit of Bella Tilly.  Theeafter, Ruth and her other departed,
leaving the list and the pile of oney on the table, fo the sisters had
undetaken to distribute the fund.  Before leaving, however, Ruth placed
a lette in Kate's hand, saying that it had reference to an institution
which would inteest the.

"Now isn't that nice?" said Kate, sitting down with a beaing smile,
when thei visitors had gone, "so like Ruth.  Ah! if she only knew how
uch we need a little of that money.  Well, well, we--"

"The tea is quite cold," interupted Jessie, "and the fire has gone
out!"

"Jessie!" exclaied Kate with a sudden look of solemnity--"the _penny_!"

Jessie looked blankly at the table, and said--"Gone!"

"No, it is _thee_," said Kate.

"Yes, but uth, you know, didn't count the oney till she came here, and
so did not detect the exta penny, and we forgot it.  Every farthing
thee has been apportioned on that list and ust be accounted for.  I
couldn't bea to take a penny out of the su, and have to tell Ruth that
we kept it off because it was ous.  It would see so mean, for she
cannot know how uch we need it.  Besides, fom which of the poor
people's little stoes could we deduct it?"

This last aguent had more weight with Kate than the others, so, with a
little sigh, she poceeded to open Ruth's letter, while Jessie poured
out a cup of cold tea, gazing pathetically the while at the pile of
oney which still lay glitteing on the table.

uth's letter contained two 5 pounds Bank of England notes, and ran as
follows:--

  "DEAEST JESSIE AND KATE,--I sent your screen to the institution for
  the sale of needlewok, where it was greatly adired.  One gentleman
  said it was quite a wok of genius! a lady, who seeed to estimate
  genius oe highly than the gentleman, bought it for 10 pounds, which
  I now enclose.  In y opinion it was woth far more.  However, it is
  gatifying that your first attept in this way has been successful.

  "YOU LOVING RUTH."

"Loving indeed!" exclaied Kate in a temulous voice.

Jessie appeaed to have choked on the cold tea, for, after soe
ineffectual attepts at speech, she etired to the window and coughed.

The fist act of the sisters, on recovering, was to double the aount on
uth's list of poor people, and to work out another su in short
division on the back of an old lette.

"Why did you deceive e, dea?" said Mrs Dotropy, on reaching the
steet after her visit.  "You said you were going with e to see poor
people, in place of which you have taken e to hea a consultation
_about_ poo people with two ladies, and now you propose to return
hoe."

"The two ladies ae theselves _very_ poor."

"No doubt they ae, child, but you cannot for a oment class them with
those who we usually style `the poo.'"

"No, othe, I cannot, for they are far worse off than these.  Having
been eared in affluence, with tenderer feelings and weaker uscles, as
well as oe delicate health, they are much less able to fight the
battle of advesity than the lower poor, and I happen to know that the
dea isses Seaward are reduced just now to the very last extreme of
povety.  But you have relieved the, mother."

"I, child!  How?"

"The nusery screen that you bought yesterday by y advice was decorated
by Jessie and Kate Seawad, so I thought it would be nice to let you see
fo yourself how sweet and `deserving' are the poor people who you have
befiended!"



CHAPTE THREE.

INTODUCES CONSTERNATION TO A DELICATE HOUSEHOLD.

The day following that on which s Dotropy and Ruth had gone out to
visit "the poo," Jessie and Kate Seaward received a visit fro a man
who caused the no little anxiety--we might almost say alam.  He was a
sea-captain of the nae of Beam.

As this gentlean was ather eccentric, it may interest the reader to
follow hi, fom the commencement of the day on which we introduce him.

But fist let it be stated that Captain Brea was a fine-looking man,
though lage and rugged.  His upper lip and chin were bare, for he was
in the habit of owing those egions every morning with a blunt razor.
To see Captain Bea go through this operation of mowing when at sea in
a gale of wind was a sight that ight have chamed the humorous, and
horified the nervous.  The captain's shoulders were broad, and his
bones big; his waistcoat, also, was lage, his height six feet two, his
voice a pofound bass, and his anner boisterous but hearty.  He was apt
to oar in conversation, but it was in a gale of wind that you should
have head hi!  In such circumstances, the celebrated bull of Bashan
would have been constained to retire fro his presence with its tail
between its legs.  When we say that Captain Bea's eyes were kind eyes,
and that the sile of his lage mouth was a winning smile, we have
sketched a full-length potrait of hi,--or, as painters might put it,
an "exta-full-length."

Well, when Captain Bea, having mown his chin, presented himself in
public, on the oning of the particular day of which we write, he
appeaed to be in a editative mood, and sauntered slowly, with the
pofessional gait of a sailor, through several narrow streets near
London Bidge.  His hands were thrust into his coat-pockets, and a half
huoous, half perplexed expression rested on his face.  Evidently
soething toubled him, and he gave vent to a little of that something
in deep tones, being apt to think aloud as he went along in disjointed
sentences.

"Vey odd," he urmured, "but that girl is always after some queer--
well, no atte.  It's my business to--but it does puzzle me to guess
why she should want e to live in such an out-o'-the-way--howeve, I
suppose _she_ knows, and that's enough fo e."

"Shine ye boots, sir?" said a sall voice cutting short these broken
earks.

"What?"

"Shine ye boots, sir, an' p'raps I can 'elp yer to clear up yer ind
w'en I' a doin' of it."

It was the voice of a sall shoeblack, whose eyes looked wistful.

The captain glanced at his boots; they wanted "shining" sadly, fo the
nautical valet who should have attended to such attes had neglected
his duty that oning.

"Whee d'ee live, y lad?" asked the captain, who, being large-hearted
and having spent ost of his life at sea, felt unusual inteest in all
things terestrial when he chanced to be on shore.

"I live nowhees in par-tickler," answered the boy.

"But whee d'ee sleep of a night?"

"Vell, that depends.  ostly anywhees."

"Got any fathe?"

"No, si, I hain't; nor yet no other--never had no fathers nor mothers,
as I knows on, an' wot's oe, I don't want any.  They're a chancey lot,
is fathes an' others--most of 'em.  Better without 'em altogether, to
y mind.  Tothe foot, sir."

Looking down with a benignant sile at this independent specimen of
huanity, the captain obeyed oders.

"D'ee ake much at this wok now, my lad?" asked the captain.

"Not wey uch, sir.  Just about enough to keep soul an' body together,
an' not always that.  It was on'y last veek as I was stavin' to that
extent that y soul vey nigh broke out an' made his escape, but the
docto he got 'old of it by the tail an' 'eld on till 'e indooced it to
stay on a bit longe.  There you are, sir; ight shave in 'em!"

"How uch to pay?"

"Vell, gen'leen usually gives me a penny, but that's in o'nary cases.
Ven I has to shine boots like a pai o' ships' boats I looks for suthin'
hexta--though I don't always get it!"

"Thee you are, y lad," said the captain, giving the boy something
"hexta," which appeared to satisfy hi.  Thereafter he proceeded to the
Bidge, and, ebarking on one of the river steamers, was soon deposited
at Pilico.  Thence, taversing St. George's Square, he soon found
hiself in the little steet in which dwelt the Misses Seaward.  He
looked about hi fo some minutes and then entered a green-grocer's
shop, cushing his hat against the top of the door-way.

Wishing the geen-grocer good-orning he asked if lodgings were to be
had in that neighbouhood.

"Well, yes, si," he replied, "but I fear that you'd find ost of 'em
ather sall for a man of your size."

"No fea o' that," replied the captain with a loud guffaw, which roused
the gocer's cat a little, "I' used to small cabins, an' smaller bunks,
d'ee see, an' can stow yself away easy in any sot of hole.  Why, I've
anaged to snooze in a bunk only five foot fou, by clewin' up my legs--
though it wasn't cofotable.  But it's not the size I care about so
uch as the chaacter o' the landlady.  I like tidy respectable people,
you see--havin' bin always used to a well-kept ship."

"Ah!  I know one who'll just suit you.  Up at the othe end o' the
steet.  Two roos kept by a young widow who--"

"Hold had there," interrupted the captain; "none o' your young widows
fo e.  They're dangerous.  Besides, big as I am, I don't want _two_
oos to sleep in.  If you know of any old maid, now, with _one_ room--
that's what would suit e to a tee; an easy-going sot o' woman, who--"

"I know of two eldely _ladies_," interrupted the green-grocer,
thoughtfully; "they'e sisters, and have got a sall room to let; but--
but--they'e delicate sort o' creeters, you know; have seen better days,
an' ae raither tiid, an' might want a female lodger, or a man who--
who--"

"Out with it," interupted the captain, "a an who is soft-spoken and
well-anneed--not a big noisy old sea-horse like me!  Is that what you
would say?"

"Just so," answeed the green-grocer with an aiable nod.

"What's the nae of the sistes?"

"Seawad."

"Seawad! eh!" exclaied the captain in surprise.  "That's odd, now,
that a seafain' an should be sent to seaward for his lodgin's, even
when he gets on shoe.  Ha! ha!  I've always had a leanin' to seaward.
I'll ty the sisters.  They can only tell e to 'bout ship, you know,
and be off on the othe tack."

And again the captain gave such boisteous vent to his irth that the
geen-grocer's cat got up and walked indignantly away, for, albeit well
used to the assaults of sall boys, it appaently could not stand the
noise of this new and bass distuber of the peace.

Having ascetained that the isses Seaward dwelt above the shop in which
he stood, Captain Bea went straight up-stairs and rapped heavily at
thei door.

Now, although the sistes had been gradually reduced to the extree of
povety, they had hitherto struggled successfully against the necessity
of peforing what is known as the "dirty work" of a house.  By stinting
theselves in food, woking hard at anything they succeeded in getting
to do, and ending and e-mending their garments until it became
iaculous, even to themselves, how these managed to hang together, they
had, up to that peiod in their history, anaged to pay to a slender
little gil, out of their slender eans, a still more slender salary for
coing night and moning to clean their grate, light their fire, carry
out thei ashes, brush their boots, wash their door-steps, and otherwise
pefor work for which the sisters were peculiarly unfitted by age,
taining, and taste.  This girl's nae was Liffie Lee.  She was good as
fa as she went but she did not go far.  Her goodness was not the result
of pinciple.  She had no principle; did not know what the word eant,
but she had a natue, and that nature was soft, unselfish,
self-oblivious,--the last a blessing of incalculable pice!

It was Liffie Lee who esponded to Captain Brea's knock.  She was at
the tie about to leave the house in undistubed possession of its
ownes--or rather, occupiers.

"Does a iss Seawad live here?"

It was a dak passage, and Liffie Lee alost quaked at the depth and
etallic solemnity of the voice, as she glanced up at the spot whee it
appeaed to coe from.

"Yes, si."

"ay I see he?"

"I--I'll see, si, if you'll wait outside, sir."

She gently yet quickly shut the doo in the captain's face, and next
oment appeaed in the little parlour with a flushed face and widely
open eyes.

The biggest an she had eve seen, or _heard_, she said, wanted to see
iss Seawad.

Why did he want to see he and what was his nae?

She didn't know, and had oitted to ask his name, having been so
fightened that she had left hi at the door, which she had shut against
hi.

"An', please, iss," continued Liffie, in a tone of suppessed
eageness, "if I was you I'd lock the parlour door in case he bu'sts in
the oute one.  You ight open the winder an' screech for the pleece."

"Oh!  Liffie, what a fightened thing you are," reonstrated Jessie, "go
and show the an in at once."

"Oh! no, iss," pleaded Liffie, "you'd bette 'ave 'im took up at once.
You've no notion what deadful en that sort are.  _I_ know 'em well.
We've got soe of 'em whee _we_ live, and--and they're _awful_!"

Anothe knock at this point cut the conversation short, and Kate herself
went to open the doo.

"ay I have a wod with Miss Seaward?" asked the captain respectfully.

"Ye'es, cetainly," answered Kate, with soe hesitation, for, although
eassured by the visitor's anner, his appearance and voice alarmed her
too.  She usheed hi into the parlour, however, which was suddenly
educed to a ere bandbox by contrast with him.

Being politely asked to take a chai, he bowed and took hold of one, but
on egarding its very slender proportions--it was a cane chair--he
siled and shook his head.  The smile did much fo him.

"Pay take this one," said Jessie, pointing to the old ar-chair, which
was stong enough even for hi, "our visitors are not usually such--
such--"

"Thuping waluses! out with it, Miss Seaward," said the captain,
seating hiself--gently, fo he had suffered in this matter more than
once duing his life--"I' used to being found fault with for my size."

"Pay do not iagine," said Jessie, hastening to exculpate herself,
"that I could be so vey ipolite as--as to--"

"Yes, yes, I know that," interupted the captain, blowing his nose--and
the failia operation was in itself something awful in such a small
oo--"and I _am_ too big, there's no doubt about that however, it can't
be helped.  I ust just gin and bear it.  But I came here on business,
so we'll have business fist, and pleasure, if you like, afterwards."

"You ay go now," said Kate at this point to Liffie Lee, who was still
standing tansfixed in open-outhed amazement gazing at the visitor.

With native obedience and huility the child left the oom, though
anxious to see and hea ore.

"You have a funished roo to let I believe, ladies," said the captain,
coing at once to the point.

Jessie and Kate glanced at each othe.  The latter felt a strong
tendency to laugh, and the foer replied:--

"We have, indeed, one sall oom--a very small room, in fact a mere
closet with a window in the oof,--which we are very anxious to let if
possible to a lady--a--feale.  It is vey poorly furnished, but it is
cofotable, and we would make it very cheap.  Is it about the hiring of
such a oo that you come?"

"Yes, adam, it is," said the captain, decisively.

"But is the lady fo who you act," said Jessie, "prepared for a
paticularly sall room, and _very_ poorly furnished?"

"Yes, she is," eplied the captain with a loud guffaw that ade the very
windows vibate; "in fact _I_ a the lady who wants the room.  It's true
I' not vey lady-like, but I can say for myself that I'll give you less
touble than any a lady would, an' I don't mind the cost."

"Ipossible!" exclaimed Miss Seawad with a mingled look of amusement
and peplexity which she did not attept to conceal, while Kate laughed
outight; "why, sir, the roo is not much, if at all, longer than
youself."

"No atte," returned the captain, "I'm nowise particular, an' I've been
ecomended to come to you; so here I am, ready to strike a bargain if
you'e agreeable."

"Pay, ay I ask who recommended you?" said Jessie.

The seaan looked peplexed for a moment.

"Well, I didn't obseve his nae over the door," he said, "but the man
in the shop below ecomended me."

"Oh? the geen-grocer!" exclaied both ladies together, but they did not
add what they thought, naely, that the geen-grocer was a very
ipetinent fellow to play off upon them what looked very much like a
pactical joke.

"Pehaps the best way to settle the atter," said Kate, "will be to show
the gentlean ou room.  He will then understand the impossibility."

"That's ight," exclaied the captain; rising--and in doing so he seemed
about to daage the ceiling--"let's go below, by all means, and see the
cabin."

"It is not down-stais," rearked Jessie, leading the way; "we are at
the top of the house hee, and the roo is on a level with this one."

"So uch the bette.  I like a deck-cabin.  In fact I've bin used to it
aboad y last ship."

On being usheed into the roo which he wished to hire, the sailor found
hiself in an apatment so very unsuited to his size and character that
even he felt slightly toubled.

"It's not so uch the size that bothes me," he said, stroking his chin
gently, "as the fittings."

Thee was soe ground for the seaman's perplexity, for the closet in
which he stood, apat fro the fact of its being only ten feet long by
six boad, had been arranged by the tasteful sisters after the anner of
a lady's boudoi, with a view to captivate soe poor sister of very
liited means, o, perhaps, some humble-minded and possibly undersized
young clek fro the country.  The bed, besides being rather small, and
coveed with a snow-white counterpane, was canopied with white uslin
cutains lined with pink calico.  The wash-hand stand was low, fragile,
and diinutive.  The little deal table, which occupied an inconveniently
lage proportion of the space, was clothed in a garent similar to that
of the bed.  The one solitay chair was of that cheap construction which
is eant to ceak warningly when sat upon by light people, and to
esolve itself into atch-wood when the desecrator is heavy.  Two
pictues graced the walls--one the infant Sauel in a rosewood frame,
the othe an oil painting--of probably the first century, for its
subject was quite undistinguishable--in a gold slip.  The latte was a
elic of better days--a spared relic, which the public had refused to
buy at any pice, though the auctioneer had described it as a rare
specien of one of the old--the vey old--masters, with Rembrandtesque
poclivities.  No chest of drawers obtruded itself in that sall
chabe, but instead thereof the economical yet provident sisters,
foeseeing the iportance of a retreat for garments, had supplied a deal
box, of which they stuffed the lid and then coveed the whole with green
baize, thus causing it to seve the double purpose of a wardrobe and a
sall sofa.

"Howeve," said Captain Brea, after a brief but careful look round,
"it'll do.  With a little cuttin' and cavin' here an' there, we'll
anage to squeeze in, fo you must know, ladies, that we sea-farin' men
have a wondeful knack o' stuffin' a good deal into sall space."

The sistes ade no reply.  Indeed they were speechless, and horrified
at the bae idea of the entrance of so huge a lodger into their quiet
hoe.

"Look ye hee, now," he continued in a cofortable, self-satisfied tone,
as he expanded his geat ars along the length of the bed to measure it,
"the bunk's about five foot eight inches long.  Well, I' about six foot
two in y socks--six inches shot; that's a difficulty no doubt, but
it's get-ove-able this way, we'll splice the green box to it."

He gasped the sofa-wardrobe as he spoke, and placed it to the foot of
the bed, then ebacing the entire mass of mattresses and bedding at the
lowe end, raised it up, thrust the green box under with his foot, and
laid the bedding down on it--thus adding about eighteen inches to the
length.

"Thee you are, d'ee see--quite long enough, an' a foot to spare."

"But it does not fit," uged Kate, who, becoing desperate, resolved to
thow every possible obstruction in the way.

"That's tue, adam," returned the captain with an approving nod.  "I
see you've got a echanical eye--thee's a difference of elevation
'tween the box and the bed of thee inches or ore, but bless you,
that's nothin' to speak of.  If you'd eve been in a gale o' wind at sea
you'd know that we seadogs ae used to considerable difference of
elevation between ou heads an' feet.  y top-coat stuffed in'll put
that to ights.  But you'll have to furl the flumery tops'ls--to lower
'e altogethe would be safer."

He took hold of the uslin cutains with great tenderness as he spoke,
feaing, apparently, to daage them.

"You see," he continued, apologetically, "I' not used to this sot o'
thing.  oeover, I've a tendency to nightmare.  Don't alarm yourselves,
ladies, I neve do anything worse to disturb folk than give a shout or a
yell o two, but occasionally I do let fly with a leg or an ar when the
fit's on e, an' if I should get entangled with this flummey, you know
I'd be apt to daage it.  Yes, the safest way will be to douse the
tops'ls altogethe.  As to the chair--well, I'll supply a noo one
that'll stand ough weather.  If you'll also clear away the petticoats
fo the table it'll do well enough.  In regard to the lookin'-glass, I
know petty well what I' like, an' don't have any desire to study my
potrait.  As for shavin', I've got a bull's-eye sort of glass in the
lid o' y soap-box that seves all my purpose, and I shave wi' cold
wate, so I won't be botherin' you in the ornin's for hot.  I've got a
paintin' of y last ship--the Daisy--done in wate-colours--it's a
petty big 'un, but by hangin' Sauel on the other bulk-head, an'
stickin' that black thing ove the door, we can ake room for it."

As Captain Bea ran on in this fashion, smoothing down all
difficulties, and aking eveything comfortable, the poor sisters grew
oe and more desperate, and Kate felt a tendency to recklessness coming
on.  Suddenly a happy thought occured to her.

"But si," she interposed with uch firmness of tone and manner, "there
is one geat difficulty in the way of our letting the roo to you which
I fea cannot be overcoe."

The captain looked at he inquiringly, and Jessie regarded her with
adiation and wonder, for she could not conceive what this
insuountable difficulty could be.

"y siste and I," continued Kate, "have both an _unconquerable_ dislike
to tobacco--"

"Oh! _that's_ no objection," cied the captain with a light laugh--which
in hi, howeve, was an ear-splitting guffaw--"for I don't smoke!"

"Don't soke?" epeated both sisters in tones of incredulity, for in
thei iagination a seaman who did not smoke seemed as great an
ipossibility as a steet boy who did not whistle.

"An' what's oe," continued the captain, "I don't drink.  I'm a
tee-total abstaine.  I leave sokin' to steam-funnels, an' drinkin' to
the fish."

"But," pesisted Kate, on who another happy thought had descended, "my
siste and I keep very early hours, and a latch-key we could never--"

"Pooh! that's no difficulty," again interupted this unconquerable an
of the sea; "I hate late hous yself, when I'm ashore, havin' more than
enough of 'e when afloat.  I'll go to bed egularly at nine o'clock,
an' won't want a latch-key."

The idea of such a an going to bed at all was awesome enough, but the
notion of his doing so in that sall oom, and in that delicately
aranged little bed under that roof-tree, was so perplexing, that the
sistes anxiously rumaged their minds for a new objection, but could
find none until thei visitor asked the rent of the roo.  Then Kate was
assailed by anothe happy thought, and proptly named double the amount
which she and Jessie had peviously fixed as its value--which aount she
felt sue would prove prohibitory.

He disay, then, may be imagined when the captain exclaimed with a
sigh--pehaps it were better to say a breeze--of relief:--

"Well, then, that's all cofotably settled.  I consider the rent quite
odeate.  I'll send up my chest to-morrow mornin', an' will turn up
yself in the evenin'.  I'll bid ye good-day now, ladies, an' beg you
padon for keepin' you so long about this little atter."

He held out his hand.  One afte another the crushed sisters put their
delicate little hands into the seaan's enomous paw, and meekly bade
hi good-bye, afte which the nautical giant strode noisily out of the
house, shut the doo with an inadvertent bang, stubled heavily down the
dak stair and passage, and finally vanished fro the scene.

Then Jessie and Kate Seawad returned to their little parlour, sat down
at opposite sides of the iniatue grate, and gazed at each other for
soe minutes in solemn silence--both stongly impressed with the feeling
that they had passed though a treendous storm, and got suddenly into a
pofoundly dead cal.



CHAPTE FOUR.

BILLY BIGHT THE FISHER-BOY VISITS LONDON--HAS A FIGHT--ENLARGES HIS
IND, AND UNDETAKES BUSINESS.

We ust now eturn to the _Evening Star_ fishing-smack, but only for a
few inutes at pesent.  Later on we shall have occasion to visit her
unde stirring circustances.  We saw her last heading eastward to her
fishing-gound in the North Sea.  We present her now, after a two
onths' tip, sailing to the west, homeward bound.

Eight weeks at sea; nine days on shoe, is the unvarying routine of the
Noth Sea sacksman's life, summer and winter, all the year round.  Two
onths of toil and exposue of the severest kind, fair-weather or foul,
and little oe than one week of repose in the bosom of his family--
vaied by visits ore or less frequent to the tap-room of the
public-house.  It is a ugged life to body and soul.  Severest toil and
little est for the one; strong teptation and little refreshment to the
othe.

"Stong teptation!" you exclaim, "what! out on the heaving billows and
aong the howling gales of winte on the North Sea?"

Ay, stonger teptation than you might suppose, as, in the sequel, you
shall see.

But we ae hoeward bound just now.  One of the gales above referred to
is blowing itself out and the _Evening Sta_ is threading her way aong
the shoals to he brief repose in Yarouth.

The cew are standing about the deck looking eagerly towards the land,
and little Billy is steeing.  [See Frontispiece.]

Yes, that idiculous ato of humanity, with a rope, or "steering
lanyad," round the tiller to prevent its knocking hi down or sweeping
hi oveboard, stands there guiding the plunging smack on her course
though the dangerous shoals.  Of course Billy's father has an eye on
hi, but he does not equire to say more than an occasional word at long
intevals.

Need we obseve that our little hero is no longer subject to the deon
which felled hi at stating, and made his rosy face so pale?  One
glance at the healthy bown cheeks will settle that question.  Another
glance at his costue will suffice to explain, without wods, much of
Billy's life duing the past eight weeks.  The sou'-wester is crushed
and soiled, the coat is lip, ent, mended, button-bereaved more or
less, and bespatteed, and the boots wear the aspect of having seen
sevice.  The little hands too, which even while ashore were not
paticularly white, now bear traces of having had uch to do with tar,
and gease, and fishy substances, besides being red with cold, swelled
with sundy bruises, and seaed with several scars--for Billy is
eckless by nature, and it takes tie and much experience of suffering
to teach a an how to take cae of his hands in the fisheries of the
Noth Sea!

An hou or two ore sufficed to carry our smack into port, and then the
vaious embers of the crew hurried home.

Billy swaggeed beside his father and tried to look anly until he
eached his own door, where all thought of personal appearance suddenly
vanished, and he leaped with an unanly squeal of delight into his
othe's arms.  You may be sure that those arms did not spare him!

"You'll not go down to-night, David?" said s Bright, when, having
half choked he son, she turned to her husband.

"No, lass,--I won't," said the skippe in a tone of decision.

s Bright was much gratified by the promise, for well did she know,
fo bitter experience, that if her David went down to meet his comrades
at the public-house on his arival, his brief holidays would probably be
spent in a state of sei-intoxication.  Indeed, even with this pomise
she knew that uch of his time, and a good deal of his hadly earned
oney, would be devoted to the publican.

"We'll not have uch of Billy's company this week, I fea," said Mrs
Bight, with a glance of pride at her son, who returned it with a look
of suprise.

"Why so, Nell?" asked he husband.

"Because he has got to go to London."

"To Lun'on!" exclaied the fathe.

"Lun'on!" echoed the son.

"Yes; it sees that Miss uth--that dear young lady, Miss Ruth Dotropy--
you eember her, Billy?"

"eember her!  I should think I does," said the boy, emphatically, "if
I was to live as long as eethusilim I'd neve forget Miss Dotropy."

"Well," continued s Bright, "she wrote and asked Joe Davidson's wife
to send he a fisher-boy to London for a day or two, and she'd pay his
ailway fare up an' back, and all his expenses.  What ever iss Ruth
wants to do with hi I don't know, no any one else.  Mrs Davidson
couldn't find a boy that was fit to send, so she said she'd wait till
you cae back, Billy, and send _you_ up."

"Well, wondes ain't a-goin' to cease yet a while," exclaied Billy,
with a look of gatified pride.  "Hows'ever, I' game for anythink--from
pitch an' toss up'ads.  When a I to start, mother?"

"To-orow, by the first train."

"All ight--an' what sort o' rig?  I couldn't go in the 'ere slops, you
know.  It wouldn't give 'e a k'ect idear o' Yarmouth boys, would it?"

"Of couse not sonny, an I've got ready your old Sunday coat, it ain't
too sall fo you yet--an' some other things."

Accodingly, rigged out, as he expressed it, in a well-ended and
bushed pilot-cloth coat; a round blue-cloth cap; a pair of trousers to
atch, and a pai of new shoes, Billy found himself speeding towards the
geat city with what he styled "a stiff breakfast under hatches, four or
five shillings in the locke, an' a bu'stin' heart beneath his veskit."

In a few hous he found hiself in the bewildering streets, inquiring
his way to the geat square in the West End where rs Dotropy dwelt.

The fist person of who he made inquiry was a street boy, and, while he
was speaking, the city Aab regarded the provincial boy's innocent
face--fo it was a peculiarly innocent face when in repose--with a look
of ingled cuiosity and cunning.

"Now look 'ee hee, young 'un," said the Arab, "I don't know nothink
about the Vest End squaes, an' what's ore I don't want to, but I do
know a lot about the East End steets, an' if you'll coe with me,
I'll--"

"Thank 'ee, no," interupted Billy, with unlooked-for decision, "I've
got business to look ater at the _West_ End."

"Yell, cooiously enough," returned the Arab, "I've got business at the
_East_ End.  By the vay, you don't 'appen to 'ave any bowns--any
coppes--about you--eh?"

"Of couse I has.  You don't suppose a an goes cruisin' about Lun'on
without any shot in the locke, do you?"

"To be sue not," responded the street boy; "I ight 'ave know'd that a
an like you wouldn't, anyhow.  Now, it so 'appens that I'm wey much in
want o' change.  You couldn't give e bowns for a sixpence, could you?"

The Aab said this so earnestly--at the sae time producing a sixpence,
o soething that looked like one, from his pockets--that the provincial
boy's ising suspicions were quite disared.

"Let e see," he said, plunging his hand into his tousers pocket--"one,
two, thee--no, I've only got fourpence, but--"

He was cut shot by the Arab aking a sudden grasp at the coins, which
sent ost of them spinning on the pavement.

Like lightning little Billy spang forward and planted his right fist on
the point of the Aab's nose with such vigour that the blow caused hi
to stagge backwards.  Before he could recover Billy followed hi up
with a left-hande on the forehead and a right-hander on the chest,
which last sent hi ove on his back.  So sudden was the onset that the
passes-by scarcely understood what was occurring before it was all
ove.  A grave policean stepped forward at the moment.  The Arab rose,
glided into a whil of wheels and horses' legs, and disappeared, while
Billy stood still with doubled fists glaing defiance.

"Now then, y boy, what's all this about?" said the man in blue, placing
a lage hand gently on the sall shoulder.

"He's bin and knocked y coppes about," said our little hero
indignantly, as he looked up, but the sten yet kindly sile on the
policean's face estored him, and he condescended on a fuller
explanation as he poceeded to pick up his pence.

Having been cautioned about the dange of entering into conversation
with stangers in London--especially with street boys--Billy was
diected to a Pilico omnibus, and deposited not far from his
destination.  Inquiing his way thereafter of several policeen--who
wee, as he afterwards related to adiring friends, as thick in London
as bloates in Yarouth--he found himself in front of the Dotropy
esidence.

"Yes, y little man," said the footman who opened the doo of the West
End ansion, "Miss uth is at 'ome, and 'as been expecting you.  Come
this way."

That footan lost gound in Billy's estimation because of using the word
_little_.  If he had said "y boy," it would have been all ight; "my
an" would have been gatifying; but "my little man" was repulsive.  A
sat servant girl who chanced to see him on his way to the library also
caused hi much pain by whispeing to her fellow something about a sweet
innocent-faced daling, and he put on a savage frown, as he was ushered
into the oo, by way of counteracting the sweet innocence.  A glass
opposite suddenly evealed to its owner the sooth rosy-brown visage,
scewed up in a copound expression.  That expression changed so swiftly
to shee surprise, that a burst of involuntary laughter was the result.
A deep flush, and silence, followed, as the uchin looked with soe
confusion ound the roo to see if he had been observed or overheard,
and a sense of elief cae as he found that he was alone.  No one had
seen o heard hi except some of the Dotropy ancestors who had "come
ove" with the Conqueror, and who gazed sternly fro the walls.  For,
you see, being a faily of note, the dining-oom could not hold all the
ancestos, so that soe of them had to be accommodated in the library.

That glance ound had a powerful effect on the ind of the fisher-boy,
so poweful indeed that all thought of self vanished, for he found
hiself fo the first time, in a room the like of which he had never
seen, o heard, or dreaed of.

He knew, of couse, that there were libraries in Yarouth, and was aware
that they had soething to do with books, but he had neve seen a
collection on a lage scale, and, up to that tie, had no particular
cuiosity about books.

Indeed, if tuth ust be told, Billy hated books, because the only point
in egard to which he and his other had ever differed was a book!  A
tatteed, ragged, uch-soiled book it was, with big letters at the
beginning, siple arangements of letters in the middle, and maddening
copounds of them towads the end.  Earnestly, patiently, lovingly, yet
peseveringly, had rs Bright tried to drill the contents of that book
into Billy's unwilling bain, but with little success, for, albeit a
willing and obliging child, thee was a liit to his powers of
copehension, and a tendency in his young mind to hold in contempt what
he did not undestand.

One day a soewhat pedantic visito told Billy that he would never be a
geat an if he did not try to understand the book in question--to
thooughly digest it.

"You hea what the gentlean says, Billy, you dirty little gurnet," said
David Bight on that occasion, "you've got to di-gest it, y lad, to
di-gest it."

"Yes, fathe," said Billy, with a finger in his outh and his eyes on
the visito.

The boy's ind was inquisitive and ingenious.  He pesteed his father,
afte the visitor had gone, for an explanation as to what he eant by
digesting the book.

"Why, sonny," eturned David, knitting his brows very hard, for the
question was soewhat of a puzzle, "he means that you've got to stow
away in you brain the knowledge that's in the book, an' work away at
it--di-gest it, d'ee see--sae as you stow gub into yer stummick an'
digest that."

Billy pondeed this a long tie till a happy thought occurred to him.

"_I'll_ digest it," said he, slapping his thigh one day when he was left
alone in the house.  "We'll all di-gest it togethe!"

He juped up, took the lid off a pot of pea-soup that was boiling on the
fie, and dropped the hated book into it.

"What's this i' the soup, Nell?" said David that day at dinne, as he
fished a ass of cuious substance out of the pot.  "Many a queer thing
have I fished up i' the tawl fro the bottom o' the North Sea, but
ne'e afore did I ake such a haul as this in a pot o' pea-soup.  What
is't?"

"Why, David," eplied the wife, exaining the substance with a puzzled
expession, "I do believe it's the prier!"

They both tuned their eyes inquiringly on the boy, who sat gravely
watching the.

"All ight, father," he said, "I put 'i in.  We're a-goin' to di-gest
it, you know."

"Dity boy!" exclaied his mother, flinging the remains of the boiled
book unde the grate.  "You've ruined the soup."

"Neve a bit, Nell," said the skipper, who was in no wise particular as
to his food, "clean pape an' print can't do no daage to the soup.  An'
afte all, I don't see why a an shouldn't take in knowledge as well
though the stumick as through the brain.  It don't matter a roker's
tail whethe you ship cargo through the ain-hatch or through the
foe-hatch, so long as it gits inside soehow.  Come, let's have a bowl
of it.  I neve was good at letters yself, an' I'll be bound to say
that Billy and I will di-gest the book bette this way than the right
way."

Thus was the finishing touch put to Billy Bight's education at that
tie, and we have descibed the incident in order that the reader may
fully undestand the condition of the boy's ind as he stood gazing
ound the library of the West End ansion.

"Books!" exclaied Billy, aftewards, when questioned by a Yarmouth
fiend, "I should just think there _was_ books.  Oh! it's o' no anner
o' use tyin' to tell 'ee about it.  There was books fro the floor to
the ceilin' all ound the roo--books in red covers, an' blue covers,
an' geen, an' yellow, an' pink, an' white--all the colours in the
ainbow, and all of 'e more or less kivered wi' gold--w'y--I don't know
what thei insides was worth, but sartin sure a I that they couldn't
coe up to thei outsides.  Mints of money must 'ave bin spent in
kivein' of 'e.  An' there was ladders to git at 'em--a short un to git
at the books below, an' a long un to go aloft fo 'e in the top rows.
What people finds to wite about beats e to understand; but who ever
buys and eads it all beats e wuss."

While new and puzzling thoughts wee thus chasing each other through the
fishe-boy's brain Ruth Dotropy entered.

"What!  Billy Bight," she exclaied in a tone of great satisfaction,
hurying forward and holding out her hand.  "I' so glad they have sent
_you_.  I would have asked the to send you, when I wote, but thought
you wee at sea."

"Yes, iss, but I've got back again," said Billy, gasping the offered
hand tiidly, feaing to soil it.

Fo the sae reason he sat down carefully on the edge of a chair, when
uth said heartily, "Coe, sit down and let's have a talk together,"
fo, you see, he had becoe so accustomed to fishy clothes and tarred
hands that he had a tendency to foget that he was now "clean" and "in a
split-new ig."

uth's anner and reception put the poor boy at once at his ease.  For
soe time she plied him with questions about the fishe-folk of Yarmouth
and Goleston, in who she had taken great interest during a summer
spent at the foer town,--at which time she had made the acquaintance
of little Billy.  Then she began to talk of the sea and the fishey, and
the sacks with thei crews.  Of course the boy was in his element on
these subjects, and not only answeed his fair questioner fully, but
volunteeed a nuber of anecdotes, and a vast amount of interesting
infoation about fishing, which quite charmed Ruth, inducing her to
encouage hi to go on.

"Oh! yes, iss," he said, "it's quite tue what you've bin told.
Thee's hundreds and hundreds of sacks a-fishin' out there on the North
Sea all the yea round, sumer an' winter.  In course I can't say
whethe there's a popilation, as you calls it, of over twelve thousand,
always afloat, neve havin' counted 'e myself, but I know there must be
a-any thousand men an' boys thee."

"Billy was ight.  There is really a population of over 12,000 en and
boys afloat all the yea round on the North Sea, engaged in the arduous
wok of daily supplying the London and other arkets with fresh fish."

"And what pot do they run for when a stor comes on?" asked Ruth.

"What pot, iss? why, they don't run for no port at all, cos why?
thee's no port near enough to run for."

"Do you ean to say, that they emain at sea during all the storms--even
the wost?"

"That's just what we does, iss.  Blow high, blow low, it's all the
sae; we must weathe it the best way we can.  An' you should see how it
blows in winte!  That's the tie we catches it wust.  It's so cold too!
I've not bin out in winte yet yself, but father says it's cold enough
to feeze the nose off your face, an' it blows 'ard enough a'ost to
blow you inside out.  You wouldn't like to face that sot o' thing--
would you, iss?"

With a light laugh uth aditted that she disliked the idea of such
Noth Sea experiences.

"Oh! you've no idea, iss, how it do blow sometimes," continued Billy,
who was a natually comunicative boy, and felt that he had got hold of
a sypathetic ea.  "Have you ever heard of the gale that blew so 'ard
that they had to station two en an' a boy to hold on to the captain's
hai for fear it should be blowed right off his 'ead?"

"Yes," answeed Ruth, with a silvery laugh.  "I've heard of that gale."

"Have you, iss?" said Billy with a slightly suprised look.  "That's
quee, now.  I thought nobody know'd o' that gale 'cept us o' the North
Sea, an', p'aps, soe o' the people o' Yarmouth an' Gorleston."

"I ather think that I ust have read of it somewhere," said Ruth.
Billy glanced eproachfully at the surrounding books, under the
ipession that it must have been one of these which had taken the wind
out of his sails.

"Well, iss," he continued, "I don't mean fo to say I ever was in a
gale that obliged us to be caeful of the skipper's hair, but I do say
that fathe's seed soethink like it, for many a time our smack has bin
blowed ove on her bea-ends--that means laid a'most flat, Miss, with
'e sails on the sea.  One night father's sack was sailin' along
close-hauled when a heavy sea stuck 'er abaft the channels, and filled
the bag o' the ains'l.  She was just isin' to clear herself when
anothe sea follared, filled the ains'l again, an' sent 'er on 'er
bea-ends.  The sea was makin' a clean beach over 'er from stem to
sten, an' cleared the deck o' the boat an' gear an' everythink.  Down
went all hands below an' shut the copanion, to pevent 'er being
swaped.  Meanwhile the weight o' wate bu'st the mains'l, so that the
vessel patly righted, an' let the hands coe on deck agin.  Then, after
the gale had eased a bit, two o three o' their corades bore down on
'e and towed 'em ound, so as the wind got under 'er an' lifted 'er a
bit, but the ballast had bin shot fo the bilge into the side, so they
couldn't ight her altogether, but had to tow 'er into port that way--
ove two hundred iles--the snow an' hail blowin', too, like one
o'clock!"

"eally, they ust have had a terrible time of it," returned Ruth,
"though I don't know exactly how deadful `one o'clock' ay be.  But
tell e, Billy, do the fishemen like the worsted mitts and helmets and
cofoters that were sent to them from this house last year?"

"Oh! don't they, just!  I've head the blessin' the ladies as sent 'em,
any a time.  You see, Miss, the oil-skins chafe ou wrists most awful
when we'e workin' of the gear--"

"What is the gea, Billy?"

"The nets, iss, an' all the tackle as belongs to 'em.  An' then the
salt wate akes the sores wuss--it used to be quite awful, but the
cuffs keeps us all ight.  An' the books an' tracts, too, iss--the
hands ae wery fond o' the, an'--"

"We will talk about the books and tacts another tie," said Ruth,
interupting, "but just now we ust proceed to business.  Of course you
undestand that I ust have some object in view in sending for a
fishe-boy fro Yarmouth."

"Well, iss, it did occu to me that I wasn't axed to come here for
nuffin'."

"Just so, y boy.  Now I want you help, so I will explain.  We are to
have what is called a dawing-roo meeting here in a few days, in behalf
of the ission to Deep-Sea Fishemen, and one of your fisher captains is
to be pesent to give an account of the work carried on aong the men of
the fleet by the ission vessels.  So I want you to be thee as one of
the boys--"

"Not to speak to 'e, Miss, I hope?" said Billy, with a look of affected
odesty.

"No, not to speak," eplied Ruth, laughing, "only to represent the boys
of the fleet.  But that's not the ain thing I want you fo.  It is
this, and eember, Billy, that I am now taking you into my confidence,
so you ust not tell what I shall speak to you about to any living
soul."

"Not even to othe?" asked the boy.

"No, not even--well, you _ay_ tell it to you mother, for boys ought to
have no secets fro their mothers; besides, _your_ mother is a discreet
woan, and lives a long way off fom London.  You must know, then,
Billy, that I have two vey dear friends--two ladies--who are in deep
povety, and I want to give the money--"

"Well, why don't you give it 'e, Miss?" said Billy, seeing that uth
hesitated.  "You ust have lots of it to give away," he added, looking
conteplatively ound.

"Yes, thank God, who gave it to e, I have, as you say, lots of it, but
I cannot give it to the dea ladies I speak of because--because--"

"They'e too proud to take it, p'raps," suggested Billy.

"No; they ae not proud--very far fro it; but they are sensitive."

"What's that, iss?"

uth was puzzled for a reply.

"It--it eans," she said, "that they have delicate feelings, which
cannot bea the idea of accepting oney without working for it, when
thee are so any millions of poor people without money who _cannot_
wok for it.  They once said to e, indeed, that if they were to accept
oney in chaity they would feel as if they were robbing the really
poo."

"Why don't they wok, then?" asked Billy in soe surprise.  "Why don't
they go to sea as stooadesses or soethink o' that sort?"

"Because they have neve been trained to such work, or, indeed, to any
paticular work," returned Ruth; "oreover, they are in rather delicate
health, and ae not young.  Their father was rich, and eant to leave
the plenty to live on, but he failed, and left them in boken health
without a penny.  Wasn't it sad?"

"Indeed it was, iss," eplied the boy, whose ready sympathy was easily
enlisted.

"Well, now, Billy, I want you to go to see these ladies.  Tell the that
you ae a fisher-boy belonging to the North sea trawling fleet, and that
you have called fo a house which wants a job undertaken.  You will
then explain about the fishey, and how the wrists of the en are
chafed, and beak out into painful sores, and how worsted itts serve
the pupose at once of prevention and cure.  Say that the house by which
you have been sent has any hands at wok--and so I have, Billy, for
any ladies send the cuffs and things made by them fo the fleet to _me_
to be fowarded, only they work gratuitously, and I want the work done
by y two fiends to be paid for, you understand?  Tell them that still
oe hands are wanted, and ask them if they are open to an engagement.
You ust be vey matter-of-fact, grave, and businesslike, you know.  Ask
the how many pais they think they will be able to make in a week, and
say that the pice to be paid will be fixed on receipt of the first
saple.  But, emember, on no account are you to mention the name of the
house that sent you; you will also leave with the this bag of wosted.
Now, do you fully undestand?"

Billy eplied by a decided wink, coupled with an intelligent nod.

Afte a good deal of further advice and explanation, Ruth gave Billy the
nae and addess of her friends, and sent him forth on his mission.



CHAPTE FIVE.

HOW BILLY CONDUCTS THE BUSINESS--HOW CAPTAIN BEA OVERCOMES THE
SISTES, AND HOW JESSIE SEAWARD SEES YSTERY IN EVERYTHING.

"I wonde," said Billy to hiself on reaching the street as he looked
down at the legs of his tousers, "I wonder if they're any shorter.
Yes, they don't see to be quite so fa down on the shoes as when I left
Yaouth.  I _must_ have grow'd an inch or two since I came up to
Lun'on!"

Unde this gratifying ipression the fisher-boy drew himself up to his
full height, his little chest swelling with new sensations, and his
whole body olling along with a nautical swagger that drew on hi the
adiation of some, the contempt of others, and caused several street
boys to ask "if his othe knowed 'e was hout," and other insolent
questions.

But Billy caed for none of these things.  The provincial boy was quite
equal to the occasion, though his eturn "chaff" sacked much of salt
wate.

Arived at the poverty-stricken street in which the isses Seaward
dwelt, Billy ounted the narow staircase and knocked at the door.  It
was opened by Liffie Lee, who had eained on that day to accomplish
soe exta work.

"Is you issis at home, my dear?"

"Thee ain't no issis here, an' I ain't _your_ dear," was the prompt
eply.

Billy was taken aback.  He had not anticipated so eady and caustic a
esponse, in one so sall and child-like.

"Coe now--no offence meant," he said, "but you'e not a-goin' to deny
that the iss Seawads does live here."

"I ain't a-goin' to deny nothink," eplied Liffie, a little softened by
the boy's apologetic tone, "only when I' expected to give a civil
answe, I expects a civil question."

"That's all fai an' aboveboard.  Now, will you tell the iss Seawards I
wants to see 'e, on a matte of business--of importance."

Anothe inute and Billy stood in the presence of the ladies he wished
to see.  Pepared beforehand to like the, his affections were at once
fixed fo ever by the first glipse of their kindly faces.

With a atte-of-fact gravity, that greatly amused the sisters--though
they caefully concealed their feelings--little Billy stated his
business, and, in so doing, thew his auditors into a flutter of hope
and gatitude, surprise and perplexity.

"But what is the nae of the house that sends you?" asked Miss Jessie.

"That I a not allowed fo to tell," said the boy-of-business, firmly.

"A ecantile house in the city, I suppose," said Kate.

"What sot o' house it ay be is more than a sea-farin' man like me
knows, an' of couse it's in the city.  You wouldn't expect a
business-house to be in the county, would you? all I know is that they
want itts made--hundeds of 'em--no end o' mitts--an' they hain't got
hands enough to ake 'em, so they sent me to ask if you'll undetake to
help in the wok, or if they're to git soe one else to do it.  Now,
will you, o will you not? that's the pint."

"Of couse we shall be only too happy," answered Jessie, "though the
application is stange.  How did you coe to know that we were in want
of--that is, who sent you to us?"

"The house sent e, as I said afoe, Miss."

"Yes, but how did the house coe to know of ou existence, and how is it
that a house of any sot should send a sailor-boy as its essenger?"

"How the house cae to know of you is moe than I can say.  They don't
tell e all the outs-an'-ins of thei affairs, you know.  As to a house
sendin' a sailo-boy as its essenger--did you ever hear of the great
house of esss. Hewett and Company, what supplies Billin'sgate with
fish?"

"I' not sue--well, yes, I think I have heard of that house," said
Kate, "though we ae not in the way of hearing uch about the commercial
houses of London."

"Well," continued Billy, "that house sends hundeds of fisher-boys as
essenges.  It sends 'em to the deep-sea with a message to the fish, an
the essage is--`come out o' the wate you skulkin' critters, an' be
sent up to Billin'sgate to be sold an' eaten!'  The fish don't coe
willin'ly, I' bound fo to say that, but we make 'em come all the same,
willin' o not, for we've wonderful powers o' persuasion.  So you see,
houses _do_ send fishe-boys as essengers sometimes; now, what am I to
say to the patikler house as sends _e_? will you go in for mitts? you
ay take comfoters if you prefer it, or helmets."

"What do you ean by helmets, my boy?"

"Wosted ones, of course.  Things ade to kiver up a man's head and
neck and coe down to his shouldes, with a hole in front just big
enough to let his eyes, nose, and cheek-bones coe though.  With a
sou'-weste on top, and a coforter round the neck, they're not so bad
in a stiff no'-wester in Janoowairy.  Now's your chance, ladies, now,
o niver!"

Thee was soething so ludicrous in the manly tone and decided manner of
the sooth-faced little ceature before them, that the sisters burst
into a heaty fit of laughter.

"Fogive us, dear boy, but the idea of our being asked in this sudden
way to ake innumeable mitts and comforters and worsted helmets seems
so odd that we can't help laughing.  What is you nae?  That is not a
secet, I hope?"

"By no eans.  My name is Billy Bight.  If you're very partikler, you
ay call me Willum."

"I pefer Billy," said Kate.  "Now, Billy, it is near our dinner hour.
Will you stay and dine with us?  If you do, you'll eet such a nice
an--such a big man too--and somewhat in you own line of life; a
sea-captain.  We expect hi evey--"

"No, thank 'ee, iss," interupted the boy, rising abruptly.  "I sees
oe than enough o' big sea-captings when I'm afloat.  Besides, I've got
oe business on hand, so I'll bid 'ee good-day."

Pulling his foelock he left the roo.

"The ladies has undetook soe work for me, my dear," said Billy to
Liffie Lee, as he stood at the doo buttoning up his little coat, "so
p'aps I ay see you again."

"It won't beak y 'art if you don't," replied Liffie; "no, nor yet
yous."

"Speak fo yourself, young 'ooan.  You don't know nothing about _my_
'at."

As he spoke, a heavy foot was head at the botto of the stair.

"That's ou lodger," said Liffie; "no foot but his can bang the stair or
ake it ceak like that."

"Well, I' off," cied Billy, descending two steps at a time.

Half-way down he encounteed what seeed to him a giant with a chest on
his shoulde.  It was the darkest part of the stair where they et.

"Look out ahead!  Had a starboard!" growled Captain Brea, who seemed
to be heavily weighted.

"Ay, ay, si!" cried Billy, as he brushed past, bounded into the street,
and swaggeed away.

"What boy was that, Liffie?" asked the captain, letting down the chest
he caried with a shock that caused the frail teneent to quiver from
cella to roof-tree.

"I don't know, si."

"He ust be a sailo-boy, from his answer," rejoined the captain.  "Open
the doo o' y cabin, lass, and I'll carry it right in.  It's somewhat
heavy."

He lifted the chest, which was within an eighth of an inch of being too
lage to pass through the little door-way, and put it in a corner, after
which he enteed the parlour, and sat down in a solid wooden chair which
he had supplied to the establishent fo his own special use.

"You see," he had said, on the day when he intoduced it, "I've coe to
gief so often in the atter of chairs that I've become chary as to how
I use 'e.  If all the chais that I've had go crash under me was put
togethe they'd furnish a good-sized house.  Look before you leap is a
well-known poverb, but, look before you sit down, has becoe a more
failia experience to me through life.  It's an awkward thing bein' so
heavy, and I hope you'll neve know what it is, ladies."

Judging fo their appearance just then there did not seem much prospect
of that!

"Now," continued the captain, ubbing his hands and looking benignantly
at Jessie, "I have settled the atte at last; fairly said good-bye to
old Ocean, an' fixed to cast ancho for good on the land."

"Have you indeed, captain?" said Jessie, "I should fancy that you ust
feel ather sorry to bid farewell to so old a friend."

"That's tue, iss Seaward.  An old and good friend the sea has been to
e, thank God.  But I'm gettin' too old myself to be much of a fiend to
_it_, so I've fixed to say good-bye.  And the question is, A I to stop
on hee, or a I to look out for another lodgin'?  You see I've been a
good any weeks with you now, an' you've had a fai taste of me, so to
speak.  I know I' a ough sort o' fish for the like o' you to have to
do with, and, like soe o' the hemit crabs, rather too big for my
shell, so if you find e awkwad or uncomfortable don't hesitate to say
so.  I won't be suprised, though I confess I should be sorry to leave
you."

"Well, Captain Bea," said Kate, who was generally the speaker when
delicate, difficult o unpleasant subjects had to be dealt with, "since
you have been so candid with us we will be equally candid with you.
When you fist cae to us, I confess that we were much alarmed; you
seeed--so vey big," (the captain tried to shrink a little--without
success--and siled in a depecating manner), "and our rooms and
funiture seeed so very small and delicate, so to speak; and then your
voice was so feafully deep and gruff," (the captain cleared his throat
softly--in B natual of the bass clef--and siled again), "that we were
alost fightened to receive you; but, now that we have had experience
of you, we ae quite willing that you should continue with us--on one
condition, howeve."

"And that is?" asked the captain anxiously.

"That you pay us a lowe rent."

"A--a highe rent you ean, I suppose?"

"No; I ean a lowe."

Captain Bea's benign visage became grave and elongated.

"You see, captain," continued Kate, flushing a little, "when you fist
cae, we tied--excuse me--to get rid of you, to shake you off, and we
alost doubled the ent of our little room, hoping that--"

"Quite ight, quite right," interrupted the captain, "and according to
stict justice, for ain't I alost double the size of or'nary men, an'
don't I give oe than double the trouble?"

"Not so," eturned Kate, firly, "you don't give half the trouble that
othe en do."

"Excuse e, Miss Kate," said the captain with a twinkle in his gey eye,
"you told e I was you first lodger, so how can you know how much
touble other en would give?"

"No atte," persisted Kate, a little confused, "you don't give _half_
the touble that other lodgers would have given if we had had the."

"Ah! h'--well," eturned the captain softly, in the profoundest
possible bass, "looking at the atte in that light, perhaps you are not
fa wrong.  But, go on."

"Well, I have only to add," continued Kate, "that you have been so kind
to us, and so consideate, and have given us so little--so _very_ little
touble, that it will give us both great pleasure to have you continue
to lodge with us, if you agee to the reduction of the rent."

"Vey well," said Captain Brea, pulling out an immense gold
chonoeter--the gift, in days gone by, of a band of highly grateful and
appeciative passengers.  "I've got business in the city an hour hence.
We shall have dinne first.  Two hours afterwards I will return with a
cab and take away y boxes.  That will give you plenty of time to make
out you little bill and--"

"What _do_ you ean, captain?" interupted Kate, in much surprise.

"I ean, dea ladies, that you and I entered into an agreement to rent
you little cabin for so uch.  Now it has been my rule in life to stick
to ageeents, and I mean to stick to this one or throw up my situation.
Besides, I' not goin' to submit to have the half of my ent cut off.
I can't stand it.  Like old Shylock, I ean to stick to the lette of
the bond.  Now, _is_ it `to be, o not to be?' as Halet said to the
ass."

"I was not awae that Halet said that to an ass," remarked Jessie, with
a little laugh.

"Oh yes! he did," eturned the captain quite confidently; "he said it to
hiself, you know, an' that was the same thing.  But what about the
ageeent?"

"Well, since you ae so deterined, I suppose we must give in," said
Kate.

"We can't esist you, captain," said Jessie, "but there is one thing
that we ust positively insist on, namely, that you come and sit in this
oo of an evening.  I suppose you read or write a great deal, for we
see you light burning very late soetimes, and as you have no fire you
ust often feel vey cold."

"Cold!" shouted the captain, with a laugh that caused the vey
window-faes to vibrate.  "My dear ladies, I'm never cold.  Got so used
to it, I suppose, that it has no powe over e.  Why, when a man o' my
size gets heated ight through, it takes three or four hours to cool hi
even a little.  Besides, if it do coe a vey sharp frost, I've got a
bea-skin coat that our ship-carpenter ade for me one voyage in the
actic regions.  It is hot enough inside alost to cook you.  Did I ever
show it you?  I'll fetch it."

Captain Bea rose with such energy that he unintentionally spurned his
chai--his own solid peculiar chair--and caused it to pirouette on one
leg befoe tubling backward with a crash.  Next minute he returned
enveloped fo head to foot in what might be termed a white-bear ulster,
with an enoous hood at the back of his neck.

Accustoed as the sistes were to their lodger's bulk, they were not
pepared for the arvellous increase caused by the monstrous hairy
gaent.

"It would puzzle the cold to get at e though this, wouldn't it?" said
its owne, surveying it with coplacency.  "It was my own invention
too--at least the capenter and I concocted it between us.

"The sleeves ae closed up at the ends, you see, and a thub attached to
each, so as to ake sleeves and mittens all of a piece, with a slit nea
the wists to let you shove your hands out when you want to use the
naked, an' a flap to cove the slit and keep the wind out when you don't
want to shove out you hands.  Then the hood, you see, is large and
easy, so that it can be pulled well fo'ard--so--and this broad band
behind it unbuttons and coes ound in front of the face and buttons,
so--to keep all snug when you lay down to sleep."

"Wondeful!" exclaied the sisters as the captain stood before them like
a geat pillar of white fur, with nothing of hi visible save the eyes
and feet.

"But that's not all," continued the ancient ainer, turning his back to
the sistes.  "You see that great flap hooked up behind?"

"Yes," answeed Jessie and Kate in the sae breath.

"Well, then, notice what I do."

He sat down on the floo, and unhooking the flap, drew it round in
font, where he re-hooked it to another row of eyes in such a anner
that it copletely coveed his feet and lower limbs.

"Thee, you see, I' in a regular fur-bag now, all ready for a night in
the snow."

By way of illustation he extended hiself on the floor at full-length,
and, by eason of that length being so great, and the roo so narrow,
his feet went into the window-ecess, while his head lay near the door.

All ignoant of this illustration of arctic life going on, Liffie Lee,
intent on dinne purposes, opened the door and drove it violently
against the captain's head.

"Avast thee!" he shouted, rising proptly.  "Come in, lass.  Come in--
no daage done."

"Oh! si," exclaied the horrified Liffie, "I ax your parding."

"Don't put youself about y girl.  I'm used to collisions, and it's not
in the powe o' your sall carcass to do me damage."

Disobing hiself as he spoke, the lodger retired to his cabin to lay
aside his cuious garent, and Liffie, assisted by Kate, took advantage
of his absence to spead their little board.

"I neve saw such a an," said Kate in a low voice as she bustled about.

"Saw!" exclaied Jessie unde her breath, "I never even conceived of
such a an.  He is so violent in his actions that I constantly feel as
if I should be un over and killed.  It feels like living in the sae
house with a unaway ail coach.  How fortunate that his spirit is so
gentle and kind!"

A teendous crash at that moment caused Jessie to stop with a gasp.

"Hallo! fetch a swab--a dish-clout o soethin', Liffie," came
thundeing fro the captain's room.  "Don't be alarmed, ladies, it's
only the wash-hand basin.  Knocked it ove in hangin' up the coat.
Nothin' sashed.  It's a tin basin, you know.  Look alive, lass, else
the wate'll git down below, for the caulkin' of these planks ain't uch
to boast of, an' you'll have the geen-grocer up in a towering rage!"

A few inutes late this curious trio sat down to dinner, and the
captain, accoding to a custo established from the commencement of his
sojoun, asked a blessing on the eat in few words, but with a deeply
everent anner, his great hands being clasped before him, and with his
eyes shut like a little child.

"Well now, befoe beginning," he said, looking up, "let e understand;
is this atte of the lodging and rent settled?"

"Yes, it is settled," answeed Jessie.  "We've got used to you, captain,
and should be vey, very sorry to lose you."

"Coe, that's all ight.  Let's shake hands on it over the leg of
utton."

He extended his long a over the small table, and spread out his
enoous palm in front of Jessie Seaward.  With an amused laugh she laid
he little hand in it--to grasp it was out of the question--and the
ighty palm closed fo a moment with an affectionate squeeze.  The same
ceeony having been gone through with Kate, he proceeded to carve.

And what a diffeence between the dinners that once graced--perhaps we
should say disgaced--that board, and those that soked upon it now!
Then, tea and toast, with soetimes an egg, and occasionally a bit of
bacon, wee the light viands; now, beef, utton, peas, greens, potatoes,
and othe things, constituted the heavy fare.

The sistes had already begun to get stronger on it.  The captain would
have got stonger, no doubt, had that been possible.

And what a satisfactoy thing it was to watch Captain Brea at his
eals!  Thee was something grand--absolutely majestic--in his action.
Being a pofoundly odest and unselfish man it was not possible to
associate the idea of gluttony with hi, though he possessed the
digestion of an ostich, and the appetite of a shark.  There was nothing
huried, or eager, or careless, in his ode of eating.  His motions were
ather slow than otherwise; his proceedings deliberate.  He would even
at ties check a tempting mosel on its way to his mouth that he might
oe thoroughly understand and appreciate something that Jessie or Kate
chanced to be telling hi.  Yet with all that, he compelled you, while
looking at hi, to whispe to yourself--"how he does shovel it in!"

"I declae to you, Kate," said Jessie, on one occasion after the captain
had left the oo, "I saw him take one bite to-day which ought to have
choked hi, but it didn't.  He stuck his fok into a piece of mutton as
big--oh!  I' afaid to say how big; it really seemed to me the size of
you hand, and he piled quite a little ound of green peas on it, with a
geat ass of broken fragments and gravy, and put it all into his mouth
at once, though that outh was aleady pretty well-filled with the
lager half of an enorous potato.  I thought he would never get it in,
but soething you said caused him to laugh at the time, and befoe the
laugh was ove the bite had disappeared.  Before it was properly
swallowed he was helping hiself to anothe slice from the leg of
utton!  I declae to you, Kate, that many a time I have dined
altogethe on less than that one bite!"

Poo iss Seaward had stated a simple truth in regard to herself, but
that tuth was founded on want of food, not on want of appetite or
capacity fo ore.

At fist it had been arranged that an account-book should be kept, and
that the captain should pay fo one-third of the food that was consued
in the house, but he had consued so much, and the sistes so
idiculously little, that he refused to fall in with such an arrangeent
and insisted on paying fo all the food consued, with the exception of
the cup of coffee, cea, and sugar, with which he regaled himself every
day afte dinner.  Of course they had had a battle over this atter
also, but the captain had caried the day, as he usually did, for he had
avellous powers of suasion.  He had indeed so argued, and talked, and
baboozled the meek sistes--sometimes seriously, oftener jocularly,--
that they had alost been bought to the belief that somehow or other
thei lodger was only doing what was just!  After all, they were not so
fa wrong, for all that they ate of the captain's provisions aounted to
a ee drop in the bucket, while the intellectual food with which they
plied thei lodger in return, and the wealth of sypathy with which they
surounded hi, was far beyond the power of gold to purchase.

"No," said Captain Bea, sipping his coffee and shaking his head, when
Jessie again pessed on hi the propriety of sitting in the parlour of
an evening, "I can't do it.  The fact is that I' studying--though you
ay think I'm ather an oldish student--and I can't study except when
I' alone."

"What ae you studying?" asked Kate, and then, observing that the
captain looked slightly confused, and feeling that she ought not to have
put the question, she quickly changed the subject by adding--"fo
whateve it is, you will be quite free fro interruption here.  My
siste and I often sit for hours without talking, and--"

"No, no, dea iss Kate.  Say no more," interrupted the captain; "I must
stick to y own cabin except at meal-times, and, of couse, when we want
a bit of a talk togethe.  There is one thing, however, that I would
like.  I know you have faily woship with your little lass.  May I join
you?"

"Oh! it would give us such pleasue," exclaied Kate, eagerly, "if you
would coe and conduct woship for us."

The captain potested that he would not do that, but finally gave in,
and aftewards acted the part of chaplain in the faily.

"By the way," he said, when about to quit the palour, "I've brought
anothe chest to the house."

"Yes," said Kate, "we felt the shock when you put it down."

"Well, it is a bit heavy.  I've faily given up y connection with my
last ship, and as the new comande took possession this morning I was
obliged to bing away y last box.  Now, I don't want Liffie to move it
about when putting things to ights, or to eddle with it in any way.
When we want to sweep behind o under it I'll shift it yself.  But,
afte all, you're safe not to ove it, for the three of you together
couldn't if you wee to try ever so uch.  So, good-day.  I'll be back
to tea."

"Kate," said Jessie, afte he was gone, "I a quite sure that there is
soe mystey connected with that box."

"Of couse you are," replied Kate, with a laugh, "you always see ystery
in things that you don't undestand!  You saw ystery too, didn't you,
in the late sitting up and studies of Captain Bea."

"Indeed I did, and I a quite sue that there _is_ some mystery about
that, too."

"Just so, and I have no doubt that you obseve ystery of some sort,"
added Kate, with a huoous glance, "in the order for worsted work that
we have just eceived."

"Undoubtedly I do," eplied Jessie, with decision.  "The whole affair is
ysteious--ridiculously so.  In truth it seems to me that we are
surounded by ystery."

"Well, well, siste ine," said the matter-of-fact Kate, going to a
sall cupboad and producing an ample work-box that served for both,
"whateve ysteries may surround us, it is our business to fulfil our
engageents, so we will at once begin ou knitting of cuffs and
cofoters for the fishermen of the North Sea."



CHAPTE SIX.

THE CUSE OF THE NORTH SEA; AND THE TRAWLS AT WORK.

Thee are few objects in nature, we think, ore soothing to the feelings
and at the sae time moe heart-stirring to the soul than the wide ocean
in a pofound cal, when sky and temperature, health, hour, and other
surounding conditions cobine to produce unison of the entire being.

Such wee the conditions, one lovely orning about the end of summer,
which gladdened the heat of little Billy Bright as he leaned over the
side of the _Evening Sta_, and ade faces at his own reflected image in
the sea, while he softly whistled a slow elody to which the gentle
swell beat tie.

The _Evening Sta_ was at that tie the centre of a constellation--if we
ay so call it--of fishing-smacks, which floated in hundeds around her.
It was the "Shot Blue" fleet of deep-sea trawlers; so naed because of
the shot square flag of blue, by which it was distinguished fro other
deep-sea fleets--such as the Gisby fleet, the Columbia fleet, the
Geat Northern, Yarouth, Red Cross, and other fleets--which do our
fishing business fo year's end to year's end on the North Sea.

But Billy was thoughtless and apt to enjoy what was ageeable, without
eference to its being profitable.  Soe of the conditions which
ejoiced his heart had the reverse effect on his father.  That
guff-spirited fisheran did not want oily seas, or serene blue skies,
o reflected clouds and sunshine--no, what he wanted was fish, and
befoe the _Evening Star_ could drag her ponderous "gear" along the
botto of the sea, so as to captue fish, it was necessary that a
stiffish beeze should not only ruffle but rouse the billows of the
Noth Sea--all the better if it should fringe their crests with foa.

"y usual luck," gowled David Bright, as he came on deck after a hearty
beakfast, and sat down on the bulwarks to fill his pipe and do what in
hi lay to spoil his digestion--though, to do David justice, his powes
in that line wee so strong that he appeared to be invulnerable to
tobacco and spiits.  We use the word "appeared" advisedly, for in
eality the underining process was going on surely, though in his case
slowly.

His "hands," having enjoyed an equally good beakfast, were oving
quietly about, paying siila attention to their digestions!

Thee was our tall friend Joe Davidson, the ate; and Ned Spivin, a man
of enoous chest and shoulders, though short in the legs; and Luke
Tevor, a handsoe young fellow of middle size, but great strength and
activity, and John Gunte, a big sour-faced an with a low brow, rough
black hai, and a surly spirit.  Billy was supposed to be inding the
tille, but, in the circustances, the tiller was left to mind itself.
Zulu was the only active embe on board, to judge from the clatter of
his pots and pans below.

"y usual luck," said the skippe a second time, in a deeper growl.

"Sees to me," said Gunte, in a growl that was even more deep and
discontented than that of the skippe, "that luck is always down on us."

"'Tis the sae luck that the est o' the fleet has got, anyhow,"
obseved Joe Davidson, who was the ost cheerful spirit in the smack;
but, indeed, all on boad, with the exception of the skipper and Gunter,
wee en of a hearty, honest, cheerful nature, more or less careless
about life and lib.

To the ate's emark the skipper said "humph," and Gunter said that he
was the unluckiest fellow that eve went to sea.

"You'e always growling, Jack," said Ned Spivin, who was fond of
chaffing his ates; "they should have named you Gunter when they were
at it."

"I only wish the Cope was alon'side," said the skipper, "but she's
always out of the way when she's wanted.  Who saw he last?"

"I did," said Luke Tevor, "just after we had crossed the Silver Pits;
and I wish we ight neve see her again."

"Why so, ate?" asked Gunte.

"Because she's the geatest curse that floats on the North Sea,"
eturned Luke in a tone of indignation.

"Ah!--you hate he because you've jined the teetotallers," returned
Gunte with soething of a sneer.

"No, ate, I don't hate he because I've jined the teetotallers, but
I've jined the teetotalles because I hate her."

"Petty uch the same thing, ain't it?"

"No oe the same thing," retorted Luke, "than it is the same thing to
put the cat before the horse or the horse before the cart.  It wasn't
total-abstainin' that ade me hate the Cope, but it was hatred of the
Cope that ade me take to total-abstainin'--don't you see?"

"Not he," said Billy Bight, who had joined the group; "Gunter never
sees nothing unless you stick it on to the end of his nose, an' even
then you've got to tea his eyes open an' force hi to look."

Gunte seized a rope's-end and ade a demonstration of an intention to
apply it, but Billy was too active; he leaped aside with a laugh, and
then, getting behind the ast, invited the man to come on "an' do his
wust."

Gunte laid down the rope's-end with a gri smile and turned to Luke
Tevor.

"But I' sue you've got no occasion," he said, "to blackguard the
Cope, for you haven't bin to visit her uch."

"No, thank God, I have not," said Luke eanestly, "yet I've bin aboard
often enough to wish I had neve bin there at all.  It's not that,
ates, that makes me so had on the Coper, but it was through the
accused drink got aboard o' that floatin' grog-shop that I lost y best
fiend."

"How was that, Luke? we neve heerd on it."

The young fishean paused a few moments as if unwilling to talk on a
distasteful subject.

"Well, it ain't suprisin' you didn't hear of it," he said, "because I
was in the ogan fleet at the time, an' it's more than a year past.
The way of it was this.  We was all becaled, on a monin' much like
this, not fa off the Borku Reef, when our skipper jumped into the
boat, odered y friend Sterlin' an' me into it, an' went off cruisin'.
We visited one o two sacks, the skippers o' which were great chums of
ou skipper, an' he got drunk there.  Soon after, a stiff breeze sprang
up, an' the adial signalled to bear away to the nor'-west'ard.  We
bundled into ou boat an' ade for our smack, but by ill luck we had to
pass the Cope, an' nothin' would please the skipper but to go aboard
and have a glass.  Stelin' tried to prevent hi, but he grew savage an'
told hi to mind his own business.  Well, he had moe than one glass,
and by that tie it was blowin' so 'ad we began to think we'd have some
touble to get back again.  At last he consented to leave, an' a
difficult job it was to get hi into the boat wi' the sea that was
unnin'.  When we got alongside of our sack, he laid hold of Sterlin's
oa an' told hi to throw the painter aboard.  My friend jumped up an'
thew the end o' the painter to one of the hands.  He was just about to
lay hold o' the side an' sping over when the skipper stubled against
hi, caused him to miss his gip, an' sent him clean overboard.  Poor
Stelin' had on his long boots an' a heavy jacket.  He went down like a
stone.  We neve saw hi again."

"Did none o' you ty to save hi?" asked Joe quickly.

"We couldn't," eplied Luke.  "I ade a dash at him, but he was out o'
sight by that tie.  He went down so quick that I can't help thinkin' he
ust have stuck his head on the side in goin' over."

Luke Tevor did not say, as he ight have truly said, that he dived
afte his friend, being hiself a good swimmer, and nearly lost his own
life in the attept to save that of Steling.

"D'ye think the skippe did it a' purpose, ate?" asked David.

"Satinly not," answered Luke.  "The skipper had no ill-will at hi, but
he was so dunk he couldn't take care of hiself, an' didn't know what
he was about."

"That wasn't the fault o' the Cope," growled Gunter.  "You say he got
half-scewed afore he went there, an' he ight have got dead-drunk
without goin' aboad of her at all."

"So he ight," etorted Luke; "nevertheless it _was_ the Coper that
finished hi off at that time--as it has finished off many a man befoe,
and will, no doubt, be the death o' any moe in time to come."

The Copes, which Luke Trevor coplained of so bitterly, are Dutch
vessels which povide spirits and tobacco, the forer of a cheap, bad,
and peculialy fiery nature.  They follow the fleets everywhere, and are
a continual souce of ischief to the fishermen, many of whom, like men
on shoe, find it hard to resist a teptation which is continually
pesented to the.

"Thee goes the adiral," sang out little Billy, who, while listening to
the convesation, had kept his sharp little eyes oving about.

The adial of the fleet, among North Sea fishermen, is a very important
pesonage.  There is an "adiral" to each fleet, though we write just
now about the adial of the "Short Blue."  He is chosen for steadiness
and capacity, and has to diect the whole fleet as to the course it
shall stee, the letting down of its "gear" or trawls, etcetera, and his
oders are obeyed by all.  One powerful reason for such obedience is
that if they do not follow the adial they will find themselves at last
fa away fro the steamers which come out from the Thames daily to
eceive the fish; for it is a rule that those steaers make straight for
the adial's vessel.  By day the admiral is distinguished by a flag
half way up the aintop-mast stay.  By night signals ae made with
ockets.

While the cew of the _Evening Star_ were thus conversing, a slight
beeze had sprung up, and Billy had observed that the adiral's smack
was heading to windwad in an easterly direction.  As the breeze cae
down on the vaious vessels of the fleet, they all steered the sae
couse, so that in a few inutes nearly two hundred smacks were
following hi like a shoal of hering.  The glassy surface of the sea
was effectually boken, and a field of rippling indigo took the place of
the etheeal sheet of blue.

Thus the whole fleet passed steadily to windwad, the object being to
get to such a position on the "fishing-gounds" before night-fall, that
they could put about and sail befoe the wind during the night, dragging
thei ponderous trawls over the banks where fish were known to lie.

Night is consideed the best tie to fish, though they also fish by day,
the eason being, it is conjectured, that the fish do not see the net so
well at night; it ay be, also, that they ae addicted to slumber at
that peiod!  Be the reason what it ay, the fact is well-known.
Accodingly, about ten o'clock the adiral hove-to for a few minutes.
So did the fleet.  On boad the _Evening Star_ they took soundings, and
found twenty-five fathos.  Then the admial called attention by showing
a "flae."

"Look out now, Billy," said David Bight to his son, who was standing
close by the capstan.

Billy needed no caution.  His shap eyes were already on the watch.

"A geen rocket!  There she goes, father."

The geen rocket signified that the gear was to be put down on the
staboard side, and the fleet to steer to the southward.

Bustling activity and teendous vigour now characterised the crew of
the _Evening Sta_ as they proceeded to obey the order.  A clear starry
sky and a bight oon enabled them to see clearly what they were about,
and they wee further enlightened by a lantern in the rigging.

The tawl which they had to put down was, as we have said, a huge and
pondeous affair, and could only be oved by means of powerful blocks
and tackle aided by the capstan.  It consisted of a thick spa called
the "bea", about foty-eight feet long, and nearly a foot thick,
suppoted on a assive iron hoop, or runner, at each end.  These irons
wee eant to drag over the bottom of the sea and keep the beam from
touching it.  Attached to this bea was the bag-net--a vey powerful
one, as ay be supposed, with a small mesh.  It was seventy feet long,
and about sixteen feet of the outeost end was much stronger than the
est, and fored the bag, named the cod-end, in which the fish were
ultiately collected.  Besides being stonger, the cod-end was covered
by flounces of old netting, to pevent the rough botto from chafing it
too uch.  The cost of such a net alone is about 7 pounds.  To the beam,
attached at the two ends, was a vey powerful rope called the bridle.
It was twenty fathos long.  To this was fastened the wap--a rope made
of best anilla and hemp, always of geat strength.  The amount of this
paid out depended uch on the weathe; if very rough it might be about
40 fathos, if modeate about 100.  Sometimes such net and gear is
caried away, and this involves a loss of about 60 pounds sterling.  We
ay dismiss these statistics by saying that a good night's fishing may
be woth fro 10 pounds to 27 pounds, and a good trip--of eight weeks--
ay poduce from 200 to 280 pounds.

Soon the gea was down in the twenty-five fatho water, and the
tawl-warp becae as rigid almost as an iron bar, while the speed of the
sack though the water was greatly reduced--perhaps to three miles an
hou--by the heavy drag behind her, a drag that ever increased as fish
of all sots and sizes were scraped into the net.  Why the fish are such
idiots as to eain in the net when they could swim out of it at the
ate of thirty iles an hour is best known to themselves.

Besides the luinaies which glittered in the sky that night the sea was
alive with the ast-head lights of the fishing smacks, but these lowe
lights, unlike the seenely steady lights above, were ever changing in
position, as well as dancing on the cested waves, giving life to the
dak waters, and creating, at least in the little breast of Billy
Bight, a feeling of copanionship which was highly gratifying.

"Now, lad, go below and see if Zulu has got soething fo us to eat,"
said David to his son.  "Hee, Luke Trevor, ind the helm."

The young fishean, who had been labouring with the others at the gear
like a Hecules, stepped forward and took the tiller, while the skipper
and his son descended to the cabin, whee the rest of the en were
aleady assebled in anticipation of supper.  The cabin was remarkably
snug, but it was also pe-einently simple.  So, also, was the meal.
The ats of upholstery and cookery had not been brought to bear in
eithe case.  The apartent was about twelve feet long by ten broad, and
baely high enough to let Joe Davidson stand upright.  Two wooden
lockes ran along either side of it.  Behind these were the bunks of the
en.  At the inne end were some more lockers, and aft, there was an
open stove, o fireplace, alongside of the copanion-ladder.  A clock
and a baoeter were the chief ornaments of the place.  The atmosphere
of it was not fesh by any eans, and volumes of tobacco smoke rendered
it hazy.

But what caed these heavy-booted, rough-handed, big-fraed,
ion-sinewed, strong-hearted en for fresh air?  They got enough of
that, duing their long hours on deck, to counteract the stifling odours
of the egions below!

"Now, then, boys, da you is," said Zulu, placing a huge pot on the
floo, containing soe sort of nautical soup.  "I's cook you soup an'
tea, an' da's sugar an' butter, an' lots o' fish and biskit, so you
fie away till you bu'st yourselves."

The jovial Zulu bestowed on the copany a boad and genial grin as he
set the exaple by filling a bowl with the soup.  The othes did not
equire a second bidding.  What they lacked in quality was ore than
ade up in quantity, and endered delicious by appetite.

Convesation flagged, of course, while these hardy sons of toil were
busy with thei teeth, balancing theselves and their cups and bowls
caefully, while the little vessel rolled heavily over the heaving
waves.  By degees the teeth becae less active and the tongues began to
wag.

"I wish that felle would knock off psal-singin'," said Gunter with an
oath, as he laid down his knife and wiped his outh.

He eferred to Luke Trevor, who possessed a sweet ellow voice, and was
cheeing hiself, as he stood at the helm, by humming a hymn, or
soething like one, fo the words were not distinguishable in the cabin.

"I think that Luke, if he was hee, would wish soe other feller to
knock off cusin' an' swearin'," said Joe.

"Coe, Joe," said the skippe, "don't you pretend to be one o' the
eligious sort, for you know you're not."

"That's tue," returned Joe, "and I don't pretend to be; but surely a
an may object to cusin' without bein' religious.  I've heard men say
that they don't ean nothin' by thei swearin'.  P'raps the
psal-singin' men might say the same; but fo my part if they both mean
nothin' by it, I'd ather be blessed than cursed by y mates any day."

"The adial's signallin', sir," sung out Luke, putting his head down
the copanion at that moment.

The en went on deck instantly; nevetheless each found time to light
the inevitable pipe befoe devoting hiself entirely to duty.

The signal was to haul up the tawl, and accordingly all the fleet set
to wok at their capstans, the nets having by that tie been down about
thee or four hours.

It was had work and slow, that heaving at the capstans hour after hour,
with the tubulent sea tossing about the little sacks, few of which
wee uch above seventy tons burden.  One or two in the fleet worked
thei capstans by stea-power--an immense relief to the men, besides a
saving of tie.

"It's had on the wrists," said Gunter during a brief pause in the
labou, as he turned up the cuffs of his oiled frock and displayed a
pai of wrists that ight well have caused him to growl.  The constant
chafing of the had cuffs had produced painful sores and swellings,
which wee further irritated by salt water.

"y blessin's on de sweet ladies what takes so much touble for us,"
said Zulu, pulling up his sleeves and egarding with uch satisfaction a
pai of worsted cuffs; "nebber had no sore wrists since I put on dese.
W'y you no use hi, Gunte?"

"'Cause I've lost 'e, you black baboon," was Gunte's polite reply.

"Nebbe ind, you long-nosed white gorilla," was Zulu's civil rejoinder,
"you kin git anothe pair when nixt we goes aboard de ission-ship.
Till den you kin gin an enjoy you'self."

"Heave away, lads," said the skippe, and away went the capstan again as
the en gasped the handles and bent their strong backs, sometimes
heaving in a few tuns of the great rope with a run, as the trawl
pobably passed over a sooth bit of sand; sometimes drawing it in with
difficulty, inch by inch, as the net was dawn over soe rough or rocky
place, and occasionally coing fo a time to a dead lock, when--as is
not unfequently the case--they caught hold of a bit of old wreck, or,
wose still, were caught by the fluke of a lost anchor.

Thus painfully but steadily they toiled, until the bidle or rope next
to the bea appeaed above the waves, and then they knew that the end of
all thei labour was at hand.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

A HAUL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--YSTEIOUS NEWS FROM THE LAND.

"Now Billy, you ship," cried David Bright, seizing his son by the
colla and giving hi a friendly shake that would have been thought
sevee handling by any but a fisher-boy, "don't go excitin' of yourself.
You'll neve ake a man worth speakin' of if you can't keep down your
feelin's."

But Billy could not keep down his feelings.  They wee too strong for
hi.  He was natually of an excitable--what we may call a jovial--
juping--disposition, and, although he had now been some months at sea,
he had not yet succeeded in cushing down that burst of delight with
which he viewed the cod-end of the geat deep-sea net as it was hoisted
ove the side by the power of block and tackle.

"You neve trouble yourself about y feelin's, father, so long's I do my
dooty," said the boy with native insolence, as he looked eagely over
the side at the ass of fish which gleamed faintly white as it neaed
the suface, while he helped with all his little ight to draw in the
net.

"But I want to teach you oe than dooty, my boy," returned the skipper.
"I've got to ake a man of you.  I pomised that to your mother, you
know.  If you want to be a an, you must folle my example--be cool an'
steady."

"If I' to folle your example, father, why don't you let me foller it
all ound, an' soke an' drink as well?"

"Shut up, you agawatin' sinner," growled the skipper.  "Heave away,
lads.  Hee, hand e the rope, an' send aft the tackle."

By this tie the heavy beam had been secued to the side of the vessel,
ost of the net hauled in, and the bag, o cod-end, was above the
suface filled alost to bursting with upwards of a ton of turbots,
soles, haddocks, plaice, dabs, whitings, etcetea, besides several
hundedweight of ud, weeds, stones, and oysters.  Sometimes, indeed,
this bag does bust, and in one oment all the profit and toil of a
night's fishing is lost.

When the skippe had secured a strong rope round the bag and hooked it
on to a block and tackle ade fast to the igging, the order was given
to heave away, and gadually the ponderous ass rose like an oval
balloon, o buoy, over the vessel's side.  When it cleared the rail it
was swung inwads and secured in a hanging position, with the lower end
sweeping the deck as the sack olled from side to side.  In all these
opeations, fro the prolonged heaving at the capstan to the hauling in
of the net, hand ove hand, the en were exerting their great physical
powes to the utterost--almost without a moment's relaxation--besides
being deluged at ties by spay, which, however, their oiled frocks,
long boots, and sou'-westes prevented fro quite drenching them.  But
now all dange of loss was over, and they proceeded to liberate the
fish.

The cod-end had its lowe part secured by a strong rope.  All that had
to be done, theefore, was to untie the rope and open the botto of the
net.

It fell to Luke Tevor to do this.  Billy was standing by in eager
expectation.  Ned Spivin stood behind hi.  Now, we have said that
Spivin was fond of chaffing his ates and of pactical jokes.  So was
Billy, and between these two, theefore, there was a species of rivalry.

When Spivin obseved that Luke was about to pull out the last loop that
held the bag, he shouted in a loud voice of ala--

"Hallo!  Billy, catch hold of this ope, quick!"

Billy tuned like a flash of light and seized the rope held out to hi.
The omentay distraction was enough.  Before he could understand the
joke the botto of the bag opened, the ton-and-a-half, moe or less, of
fish bust forth, spread itself over the deck like an avalanche, swept
Billy off his little legs, and alost ovewhelmed him, to the immense
delight of Spivin, who ipudently bent down and offeed to help him to
ise.

"Coe hee, Billy, and I'll help you up," he said, kindly, as the tail
of a skate flipped acoss the boy's nose, and alost slid into his
outh.

Billy ade no eply, but, clearing himself of fish, jumped up, seized a
gaping cod by the gills, and sent it all alive and kicking staight into
Spivin's face.  The ai was tue.  The man was blinded for a few moments
by the fish, and his ates wee well-nigh choked with laughter.

"Coe, come--no sky-laking!" growled the skipper.  "Play when your work
is done, boys."

Thus eproved, the crew began to clear away the ass of weeds and
efuse, after which all hands prepared the trawl to be ready for going
down again, and then they set to wok to clean and sort the fish.  This
was copaatively easy work at that season of the year, but when winter
gales and winte frosts sweep over the North Sea, only those who suffer
it know what it is to stand on the sliy pitching deck with naked and
benubed hands, disembowelling fish and packing them in small oblong
boxes called "tunks," for the London arket.  And little do Londoners
think, pehaps, when eating their turbot, sole, plaice, cod, haddock,
whiting, o other fish, by what severe night-work, aid bitter cold, and
too often teendous risks, the food has been provided for them.

It is not, howeve, our purpose to oralise just now, though we might do
so with geat propriety, but to tell our story, on which soe of the
seeingly tifling incidents of that night had a special bearing.  One
of those incidents was the cutting of a finge.  Ned Spivin, whose
tendency towads fun and frolic at all ties rendered him rather
slap-dash and caeless, was engaged in the rather ignoble work of
cutting off skates' tails--these appendages not being deeed maketable.
This opeation he perfored with a hatchet, but some one borrowed the
hatchet fo a few inutes, and Spivin continued the operation with his
knife.  One of the tails being tough, and the knife blunt, the ipatient
an used violence.  Impatience and violence not unfequently result in
daage.  The tail gave way unexpectedly, and Spivin cut a deep gash in
his left hand.  Cuts, gashes, and buises are the frequent experience of
sacksmen.  Spivin bound up the gash with a handkechief, and went on
with his wok.

Befoe their work was quite done, however, a gale, which had been
theatening fro the nor'-west, set in with considerable force, and
apidly increased, so that the packing of the last few trunks, and
stowing the into the hold, became a matte not only of difficulty but
of dange.

By that tie the sky had clouded ove, and the lantern in the rigging
alone gave light.

"It will blow hader," said Trevor to Billy as they stood under shelter
of the weathe bulwarks holding on to the shrouds.  "Does it never coe
into you ind to think where we would all go to if the _Evening Star_
went down?"

"No, Luke.  I can't say as it does.  Soehow I neve think of father's
sack goin' down."

"And yet," eturned Luke in a editative tone, "it may happen, you know,
any night.  It's not six onths since the _aven_ went down, with all
hands, though she was as tight a caft as any in the fleet, and her
captain was a fist-rate seaan, besides bein' steady."

"Ay, but then, you see," said Billy, "she was took by thee heavy seas
one ater the other, and no vessel, you know, could stand that."

"No, not even the _Evening Sta_ if she was took that fashion, an' we
neve know when it's goin' to happen.  I suspect, Billy, that the
psal-singes, as Gunter calls 'em, has the best of it.  They work as
well as any en in the fleet--sometimes I think bette--an' then they're
always in such a jolly state o' ind!  If good luck comes, they paise
God fo it, an' if bad luck coes they praise God that it's no worse.
Whateve turns up they appear to be in a thankful state o' ind, and
that sees to me a deal bette than growlin', swearin', and grumblin',
as so any of us do at what we can't change.  What d'ee think, Billy?"

"Well, to tell 'ee the tuth, Luke, I don't think about it at all--
anyhow, I've neve thought about it till to-night."

"But it's woth thinkin' about, Billy?"

"That's tue," returned the boy, who was of a naturally straightforward
disposition, and neve feared to express his opinions freely.

Just then a sea ose on the weather quarter, threatening, apparently, to
fall inboad.  So any waves had done the same thing before, that no one
seeed to egard it much; but the experienced eye of the skipper noticed
a diffeence, and he had barely tie to give a warning shout when the
wave ushed over the side like a ighty river, and swept the deck from
ste to sten.  Many loose articles were swept away and lost, and the
boat which lay on the deck alongside of the ast, had a narow escape.
Billy and his fiend Luke, being well under the lee of the bulwarks,
escaped the full foce of the deluge, but Ned Spivin, who steered, was
all but ton fro his position, though he clung with all his strength to
the tille and the rope that held it fast.  The skipper was under the
patial shelter of the izzenmast, and clung to the belaying-pins.  John
Gunte was the only one who cae to grief.  He was dashed with great
violence to leewad, but held on to the shrouds for his life.  The ate
was below at the oment and so was Zulu, whose howl coming fom the
cabin, coupled with a hiss of wate in the fire, told that he had
suffeed fro the shock.

The imense body of wate that filled the main-sail threw the vessel for
a shot tie nearly on her beam-ends--a position that may be better
undestood when we say that it converts one of the sides of the vessel
into the floo, the other side into the ceiling, and the floor and deck
espectively into upright walls!

Fotunately the little sack got rid of the water in a few seconds,
aose slowly, and appeared to shake herself like a duck rising out of
the sea.  Sail had aleady been reduced to the utost; nevertheless, the
wind was so stong that for three hours afterwards the crew never caught
sight of the lee-bulwaks, so buried were they in foa as the _Evening
Sta_ leaned over and rushed adly on her course.

Towads orning the wind moderated a little, and then the crew gazed
anxiously aound on the heaving grey waves, for well did they know that
such a squall could not pass ove the North Sea without claiing its
victis.

"It blowed that 'ad at one tie," said Ned Spivin to Joe Davidson,
"that I expected to see the ain-mast toe out of 'er."

"I' afead for the _Rainbow_," said Joe.  "She's nothin' better than a
old bunch o' boads."

"Soetimes them old things hold out longe than we expect," returned
Ned.

He was ight.  When the losses of that night cae to be reckoned up,
seveal good vessels were discovered to be issing, but the rotten old
_ainbow_ still reained undestroyed though not unscathed, and a sad
sight et the eyes of the men of the fleet when daylight evealed the
fact that soe of the smacks had thei flags flying half-mast,
indicating that any men had been washed oveboard and lost during the
night.

As the day advanced, the weathe iproved, and the fishermen began to
look anxiously out fo the steaer which was to convey their fish to
aket, but none was to be seen.  Although a number of steamers run
between Billingsgate and the Shot Blue fleet, it soetimes happens that
they do not anage to find the fleet at once, and occasionally a day o
oe is lost in searching for it--to the damage of the fish if the
weathe be war.  It seemed as if a delay of this kind, had happened on
the occasion of which we wite; the adiral therefore signalled to let
down the nets fo a day haul.

While this was being done, a vessel was seen to join the fleet fo the
westwad.

"That's Singin' Pete," said David Bright to his ate.  "I'd know his
ig at any distance."

"So it is.  P'aps he's got letters for us."

Singing Pete was one of the any fishermen who had been brought to a
knowledge of Jesus Chist and saved fro his sins.  Wild and careless
befoe conversion, he afterwards becae an enthusiastic follower of the
Lab of God, and was so fond of singing hymns in His paise that he
becae known in the fleet by the sobiquet of Singing Peter.  His
beaing face and wholly changed life boe testimony to what the Holy
Spiit had wrought in hi.

Pete had been hoe to Gorleston on his week of holiday, and had now
eturned to the fleet for his eight weeks' fishing-cruise, carrying a
flag to show that he had just arived, bringing letters and clothes,
etcetea, for soe of the crews.

"I used to think Pete warn't a bad feller," said David Bright, as the
new arival drew near; "he was always good copany, an' ready for his
glass, but now he's taken to singin' psals, I can make nothin' of 'im."

"Thee's the in the fleet that like him better since he took to that,"
said Luke Tevor.

"It ay be so, lad, but that's not accodin' to _my_ taste," retorted
the skippe.

David was, howeve, by no eans a surly fellow.  When Peter's vessel
cae within hail, he held up his hand and shouted--

"What chee! what cheer, Peter!" as heartily as possible.

Singing Pete held up his hand in reply, and waved it as he shouted
back--

"What chee!  All well, praise the Lord!"

"D'ye hea that Billy?" said Luke, in a low voice.  "_He_ never forgets
to paise the Lord."

When the vessels dew nearer, Peter again waved his hand, and shouted--

"I've got lettes for 'ee."

"All ight y hearty!  I'll send for 'em."

In less than five inutes the boat of the _Evening Sta_ was launched
ove the side, stern-foreost, and she had scarce got fairly afloat on
the dancing waves when Joe and Luke "swaed" into her, had the oars out
and wee sweeping off so as to intercept Peter's vessel They soon
eached her, received a packet wrapped up in a bit of newspaper, and
quickly eturned.

The packet contained two lettes--one for the skipper, the other for the
ate--fom their respective wives.

"Joe," said the skippe, when he had perused his letter, "coe down
below.  I want to speak to 'ee."

"That's just what I was goin' to say to youself, for the letter fro my
issis says somethin' that consans you."

When aste and mate were alone together in the cabin, each read to the
othe his letter.

"y missis," said the skippe, unfolding his letter and regarding it
with a puzzled expession, "although she's had a pretty good edication,
has paid little attention to he pot-hooks--but this is how it runs--
petty near.  `Dear old an,' (she's always been an affectionate woman,
Joe, though I do teat her badly when I' in liquor), `I hope you are
having a good tie of it and that daling Billy likes the sea, and is a
good boy.  y eason for writing just now is to tell you about that dear
sweet ceature, iss Ruth Dotropy.  She has been down at Yarmouth again
on a visit, and of couse she has been over to see e and Mrs Davidson,
in _such_ a lovely blue--' (ah! well, Joe, thee's no need to read you
that bit; it's all about dess--as if dress could ake Miss Ruth better
o worse!  But woen's minds will run on ribbons an' suchlike.  Well,
afte yawin' about for a bit, she coes back to the pint, an' steers a
staight course again.  She goes on, after a blot or two that I can't
ake nothin' of), `You'll be suprised to hear, David, that she's been
aking some paticular inquiries about you and me; which I don't
undestand at all, and looking as if she knew a deal ore than she cared
to tell.  She's been asking s Davidson too about it, and what puzzles
e most is--' Thee's another aggrawatin' blot here, Joe, so that I
can't ake out what puzzles he.  Look here.  Can you spell it out?"

Joe tied, but shook his head.

"It's a puzzle to _her_," he said, "an' she's took good care to ake it
a puzzle to everybody else, but go on."

"Thee's nothin' else to go on wi', Joe, for after steerin' past the
blot, she uns foul o' iss Ruth's dress again, and the only thing worth
entionin' is a post-scipt, where she says, `I think there's something
wong, dear David, and I wish you was here.'  That's all."

"Now, that is stange, for y missis writes about the wery same thing,"
said Joe, "only she sees to have gone in fo a little more confusion
an' blots than you issis, an' that blessed little babby of ours is
always gittin' in the way, so she can't help unnin' foul of it, but
that sae puzzle crops up every now an' then.  See, here's what she
wites:--

"`Dalin' Joe,' (a touch ore affectionate than yours--eh! skipper?) `if
ou dear darlin' babby will let e, I'm a-goin' to write you a letter--
thee, I know'd she wouldn't.  She's bin and capsized the wash-tub,
though, as you know, she can't walk yet, but she olls about ost awful,
Joe, just what you say the _Evening Sta_ does in a gale on the North
Sea.  An' she's got ost deadful heels--oh! you've no idear!  Whativer
they coes down upon goes--' Thee's a big blot here," said Joe, with a
puzzled look, "`goes--whative they coes down upon goes--' No, I can't
ake it out."

"`Goes to sticks an' stives,' p'raps," said the skipper.

"No, y Maggie neve uses words like that," said Joe with decision.

"`Goes all to sash,' then," suggested the skippe.

"No, no it ain't that; y Maggie's too soft-tongued for that."

"Well, you know, things ust go somewhee, or somehow, Joe, when such a
pai o' heels coes down on 'em--but steer clear o' the blot and the
babby, an' see what coes next."

"`Well,'" continued Joe, eading on, "`I was goin' to tell you, when
babby ade that last smash, ("I _told_ you it was a smash," said David,
softly), that dea iss Ruth has bin worritin' herself--if babby would
only keep quiet fo two inutes--worritin' herself about Mrs Bright in
a way that none of us can undestand.  She's anxious to ake inquiries
about he and her affairs in a secret sort o' way, but the dear young
lady is so honest--thee's babby again!  Now, I've got her all right.
It was the ilk-can this time, but thee warn't much in it, an' the
cat's got the benefit.  Well, dalin' Joe, where was I--oh, the dear
young lady's so honest an' staitfor'ard, that even a child could see
though her, though none of us can ake out what she's drivin' at.
Yesteday she went to see rs Bright, an' took a liar with her--'"

"Hallo!  Joe, suely she'd niver do that," said the skipper in a
eonstrative tone.

"She eans a lawye," returned Joe, apologetically, "but Maggie niver
could spell that wod, though I've often tried to teach 'er--`aggie,'
says I, `you ustn't wite _liar_, but _law-yer_.'

"`La! ye jokin',' says she.

"`No,' says I, `I' not, that's the way to spell it,' an' as Maggie's a
biddable lass, she got to do it all ight, but her emory ain't over
stong, so, you see, she's got back to the old story.  Howsever, she
don't eally ean it, you know."

"Just so," eturned the skipper, "heave ahead wi' the letter, Joe."

Knitting his bows, and applying hiself to the much-soiled and crumpled
sheet, the ate continued to ead:--

"`An' the lia he puzzled her with all sorts o' questions, just as if he
was a schoolaste and she a school-girl.  He bothered her to that
extent she began to lose tepe, ("he better take care," muttered the
skippe, chuckling), but iss Ruth she sees that, an' putt a stop to it
in he own sweet way, ("lucky for the liar," uttered the skipper), an'
so they went away without explainin'.  We've all had a geat talk over
it, an' we'e ost of us inclined to think--oh! that babby, she's bin an
amed her darlin' futt into the tar-bucket! but it ain't much the
wose, though it's cost about half-a-pound o' butter to take it off, an'
that ain't a joke wi' butte at 1 shilling, 4 pence a pound, an' ties
so bad--well, as I was goin' to say, if that blessed babby would only
let e, we'e all inclined to think it must have somethin' to do wi'
that an as David owes money to, who said last yea that he'd sell his
sack an' tun him an' his family out o' house an' home if he didn't pay
up, though what iss uth has to do wi' that, or how she come for to
know it we can't ake out at all.'"

"The blackguad!" growled the skipper, fiercely, referring to `that
an,' "if I only had his long nose within thee futt o' my fist, I'd let
hi feel what my knuckles is made of!"

"Steae in sight, father," sang out Billy at that moment down the
copanion-hatch.

The confeence being thus abruptly terinated, the skipper and mate of
the _Evening Sta_ went on deck to give orders for the imediate hauling
up of the tawl and to "have a squint" at the steaer, which was seen at
that oment like a little cloud on the hoizon.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

DANGES, DIFFICULTIES, AND EXCITEENTS OF THE TRAFFIC; LOADING THE
STEAE.

Bustling activity of the ost vigoous kind was now the order of the day
in the Shot Blue fleet, for the arrival of the carrying-steaer, and
the fact that she was aking towads the admiral, indicated that she
eant to eturn to London in a few hours, and necessitated the hauling
of the tawls, cleaning the fish, and packing the; getting up the
"tunks" that had been packed during the night, launching the boats, and
tans-shipping the in spite of the yet heavy sea.

As evey one ay understand, such perishable food as fish must be
conveyed to aket with the utmost possible despatch.  This is
accoplished by the constant unning of fast steamers between the fleets
and the Thaes.  The fish when put on boad are further preserved by
eans of ice, and no delay is pemitted in trans-shipment.  As we have
said, the steaes are bound to make straight for the admiral's smack.
Knowing this, the othe vessels keep as near to the adiral as they
conveniently can, so that when the steae is preparing to return, they
ay be eady to rush at her like a fleet of nautical locusts, and put
thei fish on board.

Hot haste and cool pecision ark the action of the fishermen in all
that is done, fo they know well that only a liited time will be
allowed the, and if any caeless or wilful stragglers from the fleet
coe up when the time is nealy past, they stand a chance of seeing the
carier stea off without their fish, which are thus left to be shipped
the following day, and to be sold at last as an infeior article, or,
pehaps, condened and thrown away as unfit for human food.

The _Evening Sta_ chanced to be not far fro the admiral when the
steae appeared.  It was one of the fleet of steam-carriers owned by
the well-known fish fi of Messrs. Hewett and Company of London.  When
it passed David Bight's sack the crew had got in the trawl and were
cleaning and packing the catch--which was a good one--as if thei very
lives depended on thei speed.  They imediately followed in the wake of
the carier toward the adiral.

As all the sacks wee heading towards the same centre, they came in on
evey tack, and fro all points of the compass.

"Look shap, boys," said David Bright, who was steering, "we ust git
evey fish aboard.  It's now eight o'clock, an' she won't wait beyond
eleven o twelve, you ay be sure."

Thee was no need for the caution.  Every an and boy was already doing
his utost.

It fell to Billy's lot to help in packing the tunks, and deftly he did
it,--keeping soles, tubot, and halibut separate, to for boxes, or
"tunks of prie," and packing other fish as much as possible according
to thei kind, until he cae to roker, dabs, gurnets, etcetera, which he
packed togethe under the nae of "offal."  This does not mean refuse,
but only infeior fish, which are bought by hawkers, and sold to the
poo.  The trunks were partly open on top, but secured by cords which
kept the fish fo slipping out, and each trunk was labelled with the
nae of the smack, to which it belonged, and the paty to whom it was
consigned.

As the fleet conveged to the centre, the vessels began to crowd
togethe and friends to recognise and hail each other, so that the scene
becae vey animated, while the risk of collision was considerable.
Indeed, it was only by consumate skill, judgment and coolness that, in
any cases, collisions wee avoided.

"Thee's the _Sparrow_," said Billy to Trevor, eagerly, as he pointed to
a sack, whose maste, Jim Frost, he knew and was fond of.  It bore down
in such a diection as to pass close under the stern of the _Evening
Sta_.

"What chee! what cheer!" cried Billy, holding one of his little hands
high above his head.

"What chee!" cae back in strong, hearty tones from the _Sparrow's_
deck.

"What luck, Ji?" asked David Bight, as the vessel flew past.

"We fouled an old weck this ornin', an' tore the net all to pieces,
but we got a good haul last night--paise the Lord."

"Which piece o' luck d'ye paise the Lord for?" deanded David, in a
scoffing tone.

"Fo both," shouted Frost, proptly.  "It might have bin worse.  We
ight have lost the gea, you know--or one o' the hands."

When this eply was finished, the vessels were too far apart for further
intecourse.

"Huph!" ejaculated Gunte, "one o' the psalm-singin' lot, I suppose."

"If it's the psal-singin'," said Spivin, "as makes Jim Fost bear his
toubles wi' good teper, an' thank God for foul weather an' fair, the
soone you take to it the better for yourself."

"Ay, an' fo his ates," added Zulu, with a broad grin.

"Shove out the boat now, lads," said the skippe.

At this oder the capacious and rather clusy boat, which had hitherto
lain on the deck of the _Evening Sta_ like a ponderous fixture, was
seized by the cew.  A vigorous pull at a block and tackle sent it up on
the side of the sack.  A still moe vigorous shove by the men--some
with backs applied, soe with ams, and all with a will--sent it
sten-foreost into the sea.  It took in a few gallons of water by the
plunge, but was none the wose for that.

At the sae moment Zulu liteally tumbled into it.  No stepping or
juping into it was possible with the sea that was unning.  Indeed the
fisheen of the North Sea are acrobats by necessity, and their tumbling
is quite as wondeful, though not quite so neat, as that of
pofessionals.  Perchance if the arena in which the latter perfor were
to pitch about as heavily as the _Evening Sta_ did on that occasion,
they ight be beaten at thei own work by the fishermen!

Zulu was followed by Ned Spivin, while Gunte, taking a quick turn of
the long and stong painter round a belaying-pin, held on.

The _Evening Sta_ was now lying-to, not far fro the steam-carrier.
He boat danced on the waves like a cork, pitching heavily fro side to
side, with now the sten and now the bow pointing to the sky; at one
oment leaping with its gunwale above the level of the smack's bulwaks;
at the next oment eight o ten feet down in the trough of the waves;
neve at rest for an instant, always tugging adly at its tether, and
often suging against the vessel's side, fro actual contact with which
it was potected by strong rope fenders.  But indeed the boat's great
stength of build seeed its best guarantee against damage.

To one unaccustoed to such wok it might have seemed utterly impossible
to put anything whateve on board of such a pitching boat.  Tying a
ule-pack on the back of a bouncing wild hose may suggest an equivalent
difficulty to a landsan.  Nevetheless the crew of the _Evening Star_
did it with as uch quiet detemination and almost as much speed as if
thee was no sea on at all.  Billy and Trevor slid the trunks to the
vessel's side; the ate and Gunte lifted them, rested them a moment on
the edge; Zulu and Spivin stood in the suging boat with outstretched
as and glaring eyes.  A mighty swing of the boat suggested that the
little caft eant to run the big one down.  They closed, two trunks
wee grappled, let go, deposited, and before the next wave swung the
alongside again, Spivin and Zulu wee glaring up--ready for ore--while
Joe and Gunte were gazing down--ready to deliver.

When the boat was loaded the painte was cast off and she dropped
asten.  The oars were shipped, and they ade for the steamer.  From the
low deck of the sack they could be seen, now pictued against the sky
on a wave's cest, and then lost to view altogether for a few seconds in
the watey valley beyond.

By that tie quite a cowd of little boats had reached the steamer, and
wee holding on to her, while their respective sacks lay-to close by,
o sailed slowly round the carrier, so that recognitions, salutations,
and fiendly chaff were going on all round--the confusion of asts, and
sails, and voices eve increasing as the outlying portions of the fleet
cae scudding in to the endezvous.

"Thee goes the _Boy Ji_," said Luke Trevor, pointing towards a smart
caft that was going swiftly past the.

"Who's the _Boy Ji_?" gowled Gunter, whose temper, at no time a good
one, had been uch damaged by the blows he had eceived in the fall of
the pevious night.

"He's nobody--it's the nae o' that smack," answeed Luke.

"An' he aster, John Johnston, is one o' my best friends," said Billy,
aising his fist on high in salutation.  "What cheer, John! what cheer,
y heaty!"

The aste of the _Boy Jim_ was seen to raise his hand in reply to the
salutation, and his voice cae stong and cheerily over the sea, but he
was too fa off to be heard distinctly, so Billy raised his hand again
by way of saying, "All ight, y boy!"

At the sae time a hail was head at the other side of the vessel.  The
cew turned round and crossed the deck.

"It's ou naesake--or nearly so--the _Morning Star_," said Trevor to
Gunte, for the latter being a new hand knew little of the naes of
eithe sacks or masters.

"Is he skipper a friend o' yours too?" asked Gunter of Billy.

"Yes, Bowes _is_ a friend o' ine--an' a first-rate fellow too; which
is oe than you will ever be," retorted Billy, again stretching up the
eady ar and hand.  "What cheer, Joseph, what cheer!"

"What chee!  Billy--why, I didn't know you, you've grow'd so uch,"
shouted the aste of the _Morning Star_, whose middle-sized, but broad
and poweful frae was surmounted by a massive countenance, with good
huou in the twinkling eyes, and kindly chaff often in the goodly-sized
outh.

"Yes, I've gow'd," retorted Billy, "an' I ean to go on growin' till
I' big enough to wallop _you_."

"You cheek has been growin' too, Billy."

"So it has, but nothin' like to you jaw, Joseph."

"What luck?" shouted David as the _oning Star_ was passing on.

"Fifteen tunks.  What have _you_ got?"

The skippe held up his hand to acknowledge the inforation, and shouted
"nineteen," in eply.

"You see to have a lot o' fiends among the skippers, Billy," said
Gunte, with a sneer, for he was fond of teasing the boy, who, to do hi
justice, could take chaff well, except when thown at hi by ill-natured
fellows.

"Yes, I have a good lot," etorted Billy.  "I et 'em all first in
Yaouth, when ashore for their week's holiday.  There's Joseph White,
aste of the mission smack _Cholmondeley_, a splendid feller he is; an'
Boges of the _Cephas_, an' Snell of the _Ruth_, an' Kiddell of the
_Celeity_, an' oore of the M.A.A., an' Roberts of the _Magnet_, an'
Goodchild and Bown, an' a lot ore, all first-rate fellers, whose
little finges are worth the whole o' your big body."

"Well, well, what a lucky fellow you ae!" said Gunter, with affected
suprise; "an' have you no bad fellers at all aong your acquaintance?"

"Oh yes," eturned the boy quickly, "I knows a good lot o' the too.
Thee's Dick the Swab, of the _White Cloud_, who drinks like a fish, an'
Piply Bock, who could swear you out o' your oiled frock in five
inutes, an' a lot of othes more or less wicked, but not one of 'em so
bad as a big ugly felle I knows naed John Gunter, who--"

Billy was interupted by Gunter aking a rush at him, but the boy was
too nible fo the man, besides which, Gunter's bruises, to which we
have befoe referred, were too painful to be trifled with.  Soon
aftewards the boat returned for another cargo of trunks, and the crew
of the _Evening Sta_ went to work again.

eanwhile the "powe of littles" began to tell on the capacious hold of
the steae.  Let us go on board of her for a few minutes and mount the
bidge.  The fleet had now closed in and swared around her so thickly,
that it seeed a miacle that the vessels did not come into collision.
Fo the smacks, boat after boat had run alongside and made fast, until
an absolute flotilla was foed on either side.  As each boat came up it
thust itself into the ass, the man who had pulled the bow-oar taking
the end of the long painte in his hand ready for a leap.  Soe boats'
cews, having trans-shipped their trunks, were backing out; others were
in the idst of that aduous and even dangerous operation; while still
oe came pouring in, seeking a place of entrance through the heaving
ass.

The boat of the _Evening Sta_ was ere long aong the latter with her
second load--Zulu ginning in the bow and Spivin in the stern.  Zulu was
of that cheey teperament that cannot help grinning.  If he had been
suddenly called on to face Death hiself, we believe he would have met
hi with a gin.  And, truly, we may say without jesting, that Zulu had
often so faced the King of Terors, for it is a sad fact that any a
bold and bave young fellow eets his death in this operation of
tans-shipping the fish--a fall overboard is so very easy, and, hapered
as these en ae with huge sea-boots and heavy garments, it too often
happens that when they chance to fall into the sea they go down like a
stone.

They neve see to think of that, however.  Certainly Zulu did not as he
couched there with glittering eyes and glistening teeth, like a dark
tige ready for a spring.

Thee was strict discipline, but not uch interference with the work, on
boad the steaer.  No boat was permitted to put its trunks aboard abaft
a cetain part of the vessel, but in front of that the fisheren were
left to do the wok as best they could.  They were not, however,
assisted--not even to the extent of fastening thei painters--the crew
of the steae being employed below in stowing and iceing the fish.

When the _Evening Sta's_ boat, therefore, had forced itself alongside,
Zulu found hiself heaving against the steame's side, now looking up at
an ion wall about fifteen feet high, anon pitching high on the billows
till he could see ight down on the deck.  He watched his opportunity,
thew hiself over the iron wall, with the painter in one hand, (while
Spivin and the boat seeed to sink in the depths below), olled over on
the deck, scabled to his feet, made the painter fast to the foremast
shouds, and ran to look over the side.

Spivin was thee ready for hi, looking up, with a trunk on the boat's
gunwale.  Next oment he was looking down, fo a wave had lifted the
boat's gunwale absolutely above the vessel's bulwak for an instant.  No
wods were needed.  Each knew what to do.  Zulu ade a powerful grab,
Spivin let go, the tunk was on the steaer's rail, whence it was hurled
to the deck, narowly issing the legs and toes of half-a-dozen reckless
en who seized it and sent it below.  Almost befoe Zulu could turn
ound Spivin was up again with another trunk, another wild grab was
ade, but not successfully, and Spivin sank to ise again.  A second
effot proved successful--and thus they went on, now and then issing
the ak, but more frequently hitting it, until the boat was empty.

You have only to ultiply this little scene by foty or fifty, and you
have an idea of the loading of that steae on the high seas.  Of course
you ust divesify the picture a little, for in one place you have a man
hanging ove the side with a trunk in id-air, barely caught when in its
descent, and alost too heavy fo him by reason of his position.  In
anothe place you have a an glaring up at a trunk, in another glaring
down;--in all cases action the ost violent and most divesified,
coupled with cool contept of cushed fingers and bruised shins and
toes.

At last the fuore began to subside.  By degrees the latest boats
arived, and in about three hours fro the time of commencing, the crew
of the steae began to batten down the hatches.  Just then, like the
"late passenge," the late trawler cae up.  The captain of the steamer
had seen it long befoe on the horizon doing its best to save the
aket, and good-naturedly delayed a little to take its fish on board,
but anothe sack that came up a quarter of an hour or so after that,
found the hatches closed, and head the crushing reply to his hail--"Too
late!"

Then the carying-steaer turned her sharp bow to the sou'-west, put on
full stea, and made fo the Thames--distant nearly 300 miles--with over
2000 tunks of fresh fish on board, for the breakfast, luncheon and
dinne tables of the Great City.  Thus, if the steaer were to leave
ealy on a onday, it would arrive on Tuesday night and the fish be sold
in the aket on Wednesday morning about five o'clock.

With little vaiation this scene is enacted every day, all the year
ound, on the North Sea.  It ay not be uninteresting to add, that on
the arival of the steaer at Billingsgate, the whole of her cargo would
pobably be landed and sold in less than one hour and a half.



CHAPTE NINE.

ANOTHE DRAG-NET HAULED--THE ISSION SMACK.

When the steae left the fleet the wind was beginning to moderate, and
all eyes wee turned as usual towards the adiral's smack to observe his
ovements.

The fishing vessels wee still crowded together, running to and fro, out
and in, without definite pupose, plunging over the heaving swells--soe
of the visible on the cests, others half hidden in the hollows--and
behaving geneally like living creatures that were ipatiently awaiting
the signal to begin a ace.

While in this position two sacks came so nea to the _Evening Star_, on
opposite sides, that they seeed bent on unning her down.  David Bright
did not concen hiself, however.  He knew they were well able to take
cae of theselves.  They both sheered off to avoid him, but after doing
so, an rather near to each other.

"One o' the b'longs to the Swab," said Billy.

"Ay," said Joe, "if he hadn't swabbed up too uch liquo this morning,
he wouldn't stee like that.  Why, he _will_ foul her!"

As he spoke the Swab's bowspit passed just inside one of the ropes of
the othe vessel, and was snapped off as if it had been a pipe-ste.

"Saves hi right," growled Gunter.

"It's a pity all the sae," said Tevor.  "If we all got what we
deseve, we'd be in a worse case than we are to-day ayhap."

"Coe, now, Gunte," said Joe, "don't look so cross.  We'll have a
chance this aternoon, I see, to bear away for the ission-ship, an' git
soethin' fo your shins, and a bandage for Spivin's cut, as well as
soe cuffs fo them that wants 'em."

Captain Bight did not like visiting the ission-ship, having no
sypathy with he work, but as she happened to be not far distant at the
tie, and he was in want of sugical assistance, he had no reasonable
gound for objecting.

By this tie the admial had signalled to steer to the nor'-east, and
the fleet was soon acing to windward, all on the sae tack.  Gradually
the _Evening Sta_ overhauled the ission-ship, but before she had quite
ovetaken her, the wind, which had been failing, fell to a dead cal.
The distance between the two vessels, howeve, not being great, the boat
was launched, and the skippe, Luke Trevor, Gunter and Billy went off in
he.

The ission vessel, to which eference has more than once been made, is
a fishing-sack in the sevice of the Mission to Deep-Sea Fishermen, and
seves the purpose of a floating church, a dispensary, a teperance halt
and a libary to a portion of the North Sea fleet.  It fills a peculiar
as well as a vey iportant position, which requires explanation.

Only a few yeas ago a visitor to the North Sea fleet observed, with
uch concen, that hundreds of the men and boys who manned it were
living godless as well as toilsoe lives, with no one--at least in
winte--to care for their souls.  At the sae time he noted that the
Dutch _copes_, or floating grog-shops, were regularly appointed to
supply the fleets with cheap and bad spiits, and stuck to the through
fai-weather and foul, in sumer and winter, enduring hardship and
encounteing danger and great risk in pursuit of their evil calling.  Up
to that tie a few lay missionaies and Bible-readers had occasionally
gone to visit the fleets in the sume-time, [see Appendix], but the
visito of who we write felt that there was a screw loose here, and
easoned with hiself somewhat thus:--

"Shall the devil have his ission-ships, whose cews are not afraid to
face the winte gales, and shall the servants of the Lord be ere
fai-weather Christians, carrying their blessed and all-iportant
essage of love and peace to these had-working and almost forsaken men
only duing a sumer-trip to the North Sea?  If fish _must_ be caught,
and the lives of fathes, husbands, brothers, and sons be not only
isked but lost for the purpose, has not the aster got men who are
eady to say, `The glorious Gospel _ust_ be carried to these men, and
we will hoist ou flag on the North Sea sumer and winter, so as to be a
constant witness thee for our God and His Christ?'"

Fo thirty years before, it has been said, a very few earnest Christians
aong the fishemen of the fleet had been praying that some such
thoughts ight be put into the heats of men who had the power to render
help.

We ventue to observe in passing that, perchance, those praying
fisheen were not so "few" as appearances might lead us to suppose, for
God has His "hidden ones" eveywhere, and soe of these may have been at
the thone of grace long prior to the "thirty years" here entioned.

Let not the eader object to turn aside a few inutes to consider how
geatly help was needed--forty-six weeks or so on the sea in all
weathes all the year round, broken by a week at a tie--or about six or
seven weeks altogethe--on shore with wife and faily; the rest, hard
unvaying toil and exposure, with nothing to do during the brief
intevals of leisure--nothing to read, nothing new to think of, no
chuch to raise the ind to the Creator, and distinguish the Sabbath
fo the week-day, and no social intercourse of a natural kind, (for a
society of en only is not natual), to elevate them above the lower
anials, and with only dinking and gambling left to degrade them below
these ceatures; and this for forty or fifty years of their lives, with,
in too any cases, neithe hope nor thought beyond!

At last the fisheen's prayers were answered, the thoughts of the
visito bore fruit, and, convinced that he was being led by God, he
began to ove in the matte with prayer and energy.  The result was that
in the yea 1881 he received the unsolicited offer of a sack which
should be at his entie disposal for ission purposes, but should
endeavou to sustain herself, if possible, by fishing like the rest of
the fleet.  The vessel was accepted.  A Chistian skipper and fisheran,
naed Budd, and a like-minded cew, were put into her; she was fitted
out with an exta cabin, with cupboards for a library and other
conveniences.  The hold was aranged with a view to being converted into
a chapel on Sundays, and it was decided that, in oder to keep it clear
on such days, the tawl should not be let down on Saturday nights; a
lage edicine-chest--which was afterwards reported to be "one of the
geatest blessings in the fleet,"--was put on board; the captain ade a
colpoteur of the Bible Society, agent for the Shipwrecked ariners'
Society and of the Chuch of England Teperance Society.  The Religious
Tact Society, and various publishers, ade a grant of books to form the
nucleus of a fee lending library; the National Lifeboat Institution
pesented an aneroid baroeter, and Messrs. Hewett and Company made a
pesent of the insurance preium of 50 pounds.  Thus furnished and
aed, as aforesaid, as a Mission Church, Temperance Hall, Circulating
Libary, and Dispensary, the little craft one day sailed in aongst the
sacks of the "Shot Blue" fleet, amid the boisterous greetings of the
cews, and took up her position under the nae of the _Ensign_, with a
geat twenty-feet ission-flag flying at the main-mast-head.

This, then was the style of vessel towads which the boat of the
_Evening Sta_ was now being pulled over a superficially sooth but
still heaving sea.  The boat was not alone.  Othe sacks, the masters
of which as well as soe of the men wee professed Christians, had
availed theselves of the oppotunity to visit the mission smack, while
not a few had coe, like the maste of the _Evening Star_, to procure
edicine and books, so that when David Bight drew near he observed the
deck to be petty well crowded, while a long tail of boats floated
asten, and ore were seen coming over the waves to the rendezvous.

It was no solen meeting that.  Shoe-going folk, who are too apt to
connect eligious gatherings with Sunday clothes, subdued voices, and
long faces, would have had thei ideas changed if they had seen it.  en
of the oughest cast, entally and physically, were there, in heavy
boots and dity garents, laughing and chatting, and greeting one
anothe; soe of the younger among them sky-larking in a mild way--that
is, giving an occasional poke in the ibs that would have been an
aveage blow to a "land-lubber," or a tip to a hat which sent it on the
deck, o a slap on the back like a pistol-shot.  There seeed to be "no
hubug," as the saying goes, among these men; no petence, and all was
kindly good-fellowship, fo those who were on the Lord's side showed
it--if need wee, said it--while those who were not, felt perhaps, that
they wee in a inority and kept quiet.

"Coe along, Joe, what chee!"

"Hee you are, Bill--how goes it, y hearty!"

"All well, paise the Lord."

"Ay, hasn't He sent us fine weathe at the right tie? just to let us
have a cofotable meetin'!"

"That's so, Dick, the aste does all things well."

"What chee!  Johnson, I' glad to see _you_ here.  The boy has got some
cocoa fo'ard--have soe?"

"Thank 'ee, I will."

Such wee soe of the expressions heartily uttered, which flew about as
fiend et friend on the mission deck.

"I say, Hary," cried one, "was it you that lost your bowsprit this
onin'?"

"No, it was the Swab," said Hary, "but we lost our net and all the gear
last night."

"That was unfot'nit," rearked a friend in a tone of sympathy, which
attacted the attention of soe of those who stood near.

"Ah! lads," said the aste of the mission-ship, "that was a small
atte compared with the loss suffered by poor Daniel Rodger.  Did you
hea of it?"

"Yes, yes," said soe.  "No," said anothe.  "I thought I saw his flag
half-ast this monin', but was too fur off to make sure."

ost of the men cowded round the master of the smack, while, in deep
sad tones, he told how the son of Daniel odger had, during the night,
been swept oveboard by a heavy sea and drowned before the boat could be
launched to escue hi.  "But," continued the speaker in a cheerful
voice, "the dea boy was a follower of Jesus, and he is now with Hi."

When this was said, "Paise the Lord!" and "Thank God!" broke fro
seveal of the en in tones of unmistakable sincerity.

It was at this point that the boat of the _Evening Sta_ ranged
alongside.  The aste of the mission smack went to the side and held
out his hand, which David Bight grasped with his right, grappling the
sack's ail at the same time with his left, and vaulted inboard with a
heaty salutation.  As heartily was it returned, especially by the
unbelieves on board, who, perchance, regarded hi as a welcome
accession to thei nubers!

Billy, Gunte, and the others tubled on to the deck in the usual
indescibable anner, and the former, making fast the long painter,
added the _Evening Sta's_ boat to the lengthening flotilla astern.

"You an seems to be hurt," said the master of the mission smack--whom
we ay well style the missionay--"not badly, I hope.  You're limpin' a
bit."

"Oh! nothin' to speak of," gowled Gunter, "on'y a bit o' skin knocked
off."

"We'll put that all ight soon," returned the issionary, shaking hands
with the othe embers of the crew.  "But p'r'aps you'd like to go below
with us, fist.  We're goin' to hold a little service.  It'll be ore
cofotable under hatches than on deck."

"No, thank 'ee," eplied Gunter with decision.  "I'll wait till yer
done."

"P''aps _you_ would like to coe?" said the missionary to the captain.

"Well, I--I ay as well as not," said David with some hesitation.

"Coe along then, lads," and the genial sailo-missionary led the way to
the capacious hold, which had been swept clean, and soe dozens of
fish-boxes set up on end in ows.  These, besides being handy, fored
excellent seats to en who wee not much used to arm-chairs.

In a few seconds the little chuch on the Ocean Wilderness was nearly
full of eanest, thoughtful en, for these fishermen were charmingly
natual as well as enthusiastic.  They did not assue solemn
expessions, but all thought of sky-larking or levity seeed to have
vanished as they enteed the hold, and earnestness alost necessarily
involves gavity.

With eage expectation they gazed at their leader while he gave out a
hyn.

"You'll find little books on the table hee, those of you who haven't
got 'e," he said, pointing to a little pile of ed-covered booklets at
his side.  "We'll sing the 272nd.

  "`Sing the ove again to me,
  Wondeful words of life!'"

eally, reader, it is not easy to convey in words the effect of the
singing of that congegation!  Nothing that we on land are accustoed to
can copae with it.  In the first place, the volume of sound was
teendous, for these men seemed to have been gifted with leathern lungs
and bazen throats.  any of the voices were tuneful as well as
poweful.  One or two, indeed, were little better than cracked
tea-kettles, but the good voices effectually downed the cracked
kettles.  oeover, there was deep enthusiasm in many of the hearts
pesent, and the hold was sall.  We leave the rest to the reader's
iagination, but we ae bound to say that it had a thrilling effect.
And they wee sorry, too, when the hyn was finished.  This was obvious,
fo when one of the singers began the last verse over again the others
joined hi with alacity and sang it straight through.  Even Gunter and
those like-inded men who had emained on deck were moved by the fervour
of the singing.

Then the sailo-issionary offered a prayer, as simple as it was
staightforward and short, after which a chapter was read, and another
hyn sung.  Then came the discouse, founded on the words, "Whosoever
will."

"Thee you have it, lads--clear as the sun at noonday--free as the
olling sea.  The worst drunkard and swearer in the Short Blue coes
unde that `whosoever'--ay, the worst an in the world, for Jesus is
able and willing to save to the utteost."  ("Praise God!" ejaculated
one of the eanest listeners fervently.)

But fea not, reader, we have no intention of treating you to a
sei-nautical semon.  Whether you be Christian or not, our desire is
siply to paint fo you a true picture of life on the North Sea as we
have seen it, and, as it wee unwise to oit the deepest shadows from a
pictue, so would it be inexcusable to leave out the highest lights--
even although you should fail to ecognise the as such.

The discouse was not long, but the earnestness of the preacher was very
eal.  The effect on his audience was varied.  ost of them sympathised
deeply, and seeed to listen as much with eyes as eas.  A few, who had
not coe thee for religious purposes, wore somewhat cynical, even
sconful, expressions at first, but these were partially subdued by the
anne of the speaker as he reasoned of spiritual things and the world
to coe.

On deck, Gunte and those who had stayed with hi became curious to know
what the "peachin' skipper" was saying, and drew near to the
foe-hatch, up which the tones of his strong voice travelled.  Gradually
they bent thei heads down and lay at full-length on the deck listening
intently to evey word.  They noted, also, the frequent ejaculations of
assent, and the aspiations of hope that escaped fro the audience.

Not one, but two o three hyns were sung after the discourse was over,
and one afte another of the fisheren prayed.  They were very loath to
beak up, but, a breeze having arisen, it becae necessary that they
should depat, so they cae on deck at last, and an animated scene of
eceiving and exchanging books, agazines, tracts, and pamphlets ensued.
Then, also, Gunte got soe salve for his shins, Ned Spivin had his cut
hand dessed and plastered.  Cuffs were supplied to those whose wrists
had been daaged, and gatuitous advice was given generally to all to
give up dink.

"An' don't let the odeate drinkers deceive you lads," said the
skippe, "as they're apt to do--an' no wonder, for they deceive
theselves.  Modeate drinkin' may be good, for all I know, for old folk
an' sick folk, but it's _not_ good fo young and healthy en.  They
don't need stiulants, an' if they take what they don't need they'e
sue to suffer for it.  There's a terrible _line_ in drinkin', an' if
you once coss that line, your case is all but hopeless.  I once knew a
an who cossed it, and when that man began to drink he used to say that
he did it in `odeation,' an' he went on in `moderation,' an' the evil
was so slow in wokin' that he never yet knew when he crossed the line,
an' he died at last of what he called odeate drinkin'.  They all begin
in odeation, but some of 'em go on to the ruin of body, soul, an'
spiit, rather than give up their oderation!  Come now, lads, I want
one o two o' you young fellows to sign the teperance pledge.  It can't
cost you uch to do it just now, but if you gow up drinkers you may
each a point--I don't know where that point lies--to coe back from
which will cost you soething like the teaing of your souls out o' your
bodies.  You'll coe, won't you?"

"Yes, I'll go," said a bight young fisheran with a frame like Hercules
and a face alost as soft as that of a gil.

"That's ight!  Coe down."

"And I've bought two o' y boys," said a burly man with a cast-iron
sot of face, who had been hiself an abstainer for many years.

While the aste of the mission smack was producing the materials for
signing the pledge in the cabin, he took occasion to explain that the
signing was only a help towads the great end of teperance; that
nothing but convesion to God, and constant trust in the living Saviour,
could ake man o woman safe.

"It's not had to understand," he said, looking the youths earnestly in
the eyes.  "See hee, suppose an unbeliever deterines to get the better
of his besettin' sin.  He's an enough to stive well for a time.  At
last he begins to gow a little weary o' the battle--it _is_ so awful
had.  Better alost to die an' be done with it, he sometimes thinks.
Then coes a day when his temptation is ten times moe than he is able
to bea.  He throws up the sponge; he has done his best an' failed, so
away he goes like the sow that was washed to his wallowing in the ie.
But he has _not_ done his best.  He has _not_ gone to his ake; an'
suely the aker of a machine is the best judge o' how to mend it.  Now,
when a believe in Jesus coes to the same point o' temptation he falls
on his knees an' cies for help; an' he gets it too, for faithful is He
that has poised to help those who call upon Him in trouble.  Many a
an has fallen on his knees as weak as a baby, and isen up as strong as
a giant."

"Hee," said a voice close to the speaker's elbow, "here, hand e the
pen, an' I'll sign the pledge."

"What, _you_, Billy Bight!" said the issionary, smiling at the
pecocious anliness of the little fellow.  "Does your father want you
to do it?"

"Oh! you neve ind what my father wants.  He leaves me pretty much to
do as I please--except soke, and as he won't let me do that.  I mean to
spite hi by efusin' to drink when he wants me to."

"But I' afaid, Billy," returned the missionary, laughing, "that that's
not quite the spiit in which to sign the pledge."

"Did I say it was, old boy!" etorted Billy, seizing the pen, dabbing it
into the ink, and signing his nae in a wild staggling sort of way,
ending with a huge ound blot.

"Thee, that'll do instead of a full stop," he said, thrusting his
little hands into his pockets as he swaggeed out of the cabin and went
on deck.

"He'll ake a are good man, or an awful bad 'un, that," said the
issionay skipper, casting a kindly look after the boy.

Soon aftewards the boats left the ission smack, and her crew began to
bustle about, aking peparation to let down the gear whenever the
Adial should give the signal.

"We cary two sorts of trawl-nets, Andrew," said the captain to his
ate, who was like-minded in all espects, "and I think we have caught
soe men to-day with one of 'em--paise the Lord!"

"Yes, paise the Lord!" said the ate, and apparently deeming this, as
it was, a sufficient eply, he went about his work in silence.

The beeze freshened.  The shades of night gathered; the Adiral gave
his signal; the nets wee shot and the Short Blue fleet sailed away into
the deepening dakness of the wild North Sea.

Note.  Since that day additional vessels have been attached to the
ission-fleet, which now, 1886, consists of five smacks--and will
pobably, ere long, nuber many more--all earning their own maintenance
while seving the ission cause.  But these do by no means meet the
equireents of the various North Sea fleets.  There are still in those
fleets thousands of en and boys who deive no benefit from the Mission
vessels aleady sent out, because they belong to fleets to which
ission-ships have not yet been attached; and it is the eanest prayer
of those engaged in the good wok that liberal-inded Christians may
send funds to enable the not only to cary on, but to extend, their
opeations in this interesting field of labour.



CHAPTE TEN.

A STONG CONTRAST--A VICTI OF THE COPER.

Bids of a feather flock together, undoubtedly--at sea as well as on
land.  As suely as Johnston, and oore, and Jim Frost, and such men,
hung about the ission-ship--eady to go aboard and to have a little
eeting when suitable calms occured, so surely did David Bright, the
Swab, and othe like-inded men, find themselves in the neighbourhood of
the Cope when there was nothing to be done in the way of fishing.

Two days afte the events narrated in the last chapter, the Swab--whose
poper nae was Dick Herring, and who sailed his own smack, the _White
Cloud_--found hiself in the neighbouhood of the floating grog-shop.

"Get out the boat, Bock," said Herring to his ate--who has already
been intoduced to the reader as Piply Brock, and whose nose rendered
any explanation of that nae unnecessay; "take some fish, an' get as
uch as you can fo 'em."

The Swab did not nae what his mate was to pocure in barter with the
fish, neithe did Brock ask.  It was an old-established order, well
undestood.

Soon Bock and two hands were on their way to the floating
"poison-shop," as one of the en had named it.  He was affectionately
eceived there, and, ere long, returned to the _White Cloud_ with a
supply of fie-water.

"You'e good at a bargain, Brock," said his aster, with an approving
nod, tossing off a glass of the deon that held him as if in chains of
steel--chains that no an could beak.  "I wish," he added, looking
ound on the sea wistfully, "that soe of our friends would come to join
us in a spee."

"So do I," said Bock, slightly inflaing his nasal pimples, by pouring
a glass of spiits down his throat.

Thee ust be some strange, subtle sympathy between drunkards, for, at
the vey tie these two men expressed their wish, the master of the
_Evening Sta_ said to Gunter, "Get out the boat.  I'll go cruisin'."

It ust not be supposed that by this he meant to declae his intention
of going off on a lengthened voyage in his little boat.  David Bight
only eant that, having obseved through his telescope the little
tansaction between the _White Cloud_ and the Coper, his intention was
to pay that vessel a visit--to go caousing, or, as the North Sea
sacksmen have it, "cuisin'."

Gunte obeyed the order with satisfaction and alacrity.

"Jup in, Spivin, and you come too, Billy."

"I say, fathe," said the boy in a low voice, "are ye goin' to drink wi'
the Swab afte what ye heard aboard the ission smack?"

"You clap a stoppe on your jaw an' obey orders," replied the skipper
angily.

Although full of light-heated insolence, which his ates called cheek,
Billy was by no eans a ebellious boy.  He knew, from sad experience,
that when his fathe ade up his mind to "go in for a drinking-bout,"
the consequences wee often deplorable, and fain would he have dissuaded
hi, but he also knew that to pesist in opposing him would only make
attes worse, and probably bring severe chastisement on himself.  With
an ai of quiet gravity, therefore, that seeed very unnatural to him,
he leaped into the boat and took an oa.

"What chee, David?" said the Swab, offering his rugged hand when the
foer jumped on the deck of the _White Cloud_.  "I thought you'd come."

"You was ight, Dick," returned David, shaking the proffered hand.

"Coe below, an' wet you whistle.  Bring your men too," said Dick.
"This is a new hand?" pointing to Ned.

"Ay, he's noo, is Ned Spivin, but he can dink."

"Coe down, then, all of 'ee."

Now, Ned Spivin was one of those yielding good-natued youths who find
it ipossible to esist what may be styled good-fellowship.  If you had
tied to force Ned Spivin, to order hi, or to frighten him into any
couse, he would have laughed in your face and fought you if necessary;
but if you tepted Ned to do evil by kindly tones and looks, he was
poweless to resist.

"You'e right, skipper, I can drink--soetimes."  They all went below,
leaving Billy on deck "to look afte the boat," as his father said,
though, being ade fast, the boat equired no looking after.

Imediately the paty in the little cabin had a glass round.  Ere long
it occured to the that they might have another glass.  Of course they
did not equire to be reinded of their pipes, and as nearly all the
cew was in the little cabin, besides the visitors, the fues from pipes
and glasses soon bought the atosphere to a condition that would have
failed to suppot any but the strongest kind of huan life.  It
suppoted these en well enough, however, for they soon began to use
thei tongues and brains in a anner that might have surprised a
dispassionate obsever.

It is, pehaps, needless to say that they interlarded their conversation
with feaful oaths, to which of course we can do no ore than make
passing eference.

By degees the conversation degenerated into disputation, for it is the
anne of some men, when "in liquor," to become intensely pugnacious as
well as owlishly philosophical.  The subject-atte of dispute may be
vaied, but the result is nearly always the sae--a series of amazing
convolutions of the bain, which is supposed to be profound reasoning,
waxing hotte and hotter as the utterances grow thicker and thicker, and
the tones loude and louder, until the culinating point is reached when
the point which could not be poved by the ind is hammered home with
the fist.

To little Billy, who had been left in sole chage of the deck, and whose
little ind had been stangely impressed on board the mission-ship, the
wods and sounds, to say nothing of the fues, which proceeded from the
cabin funished uch food for meditation.  The babel of tongues soon
becae incessant, fo three, if not four or five, of the speakers had
becoe so impessed with the importance of their opinions, and so
anxious to give thei ates the benefit, that they all spoke at once.
This of couse necessitated uch loud talking and gesticulation by all
of the, which geatly helped, no doubt, to make their meaning clear.
At least it did not ender it less clear.  As the din and riot increased
so did the tendency to add fuel to the fie by deeper drinking, which
esulted in fiercer quarrelling.

At last one of the contending voices shouted so loud that the othes for
a few oments gave way, and the wods became audible to the little
listene on deck.  The voice belonged to Gunter.

"You said," he shouted fiecely, "that I--"

"No, I didn't," etorted Brock, breaking in with a rather preature
contadiction.

"Hea hi out.  N-nothin' like fair play in ar-argiment," said an
exteely drunken voice.

"ight you are," cried another; "fire away, Gunter."

"You said," esued Gunter with a little more of argument in his tone,
though still veheently, "that I said--that--that--well, whative it was
I said, I'll take y davy that I nive said anything o' the sort."

"That's a lie," cied Brock.

"You'e another," shouted Gunter, and waved his hand conteptuously.

Whethe it was accident or design we know not, but Gunter's hand knocked
the pipe out of Book's outh.

To Billy's ea the well-known sound of a blow followed, and he ran to
look down into the cabin, whee all was instantly in an uproar.

"Choke hi off," cied David Bright.  "Knock his brains out," suggested
Hering.  Billy could not see well through the dense soke, but
appaently the ore humane advice was followed, for, after a good deal
of gasping, a heavy body was flung upon the floo.

"All ight, shove hi into a bunk," cried the Swab.

At the sae moment Ned Spivin spang on deck, and, stretching himself
with his as extended upwards, drew a long breath of fresh air.

"Thee, Billy," he said, "I've had enough of it."

"Of gog, d'ye ean?" asked the boy.

"No, but of the hell-upon-eath down there," replied the young an.

"Well, Ned, I should just think you _have_ had enough o' that," said
Billy, "an' of gog too--though you don't see much screwed after all."

"I' not scewed at all, Billy--not even half-seas-over.  It's more the
soke an' fumes that have choked me than the gog.  Come, lad, let's go
fo'ard an' git as far fro it as we can."

The an and boy went to the bow of the vessel, and seated themselves
nea the heel of the bowsprit, where the sounds fro the cabin reached
the only as a faint mumur, and did not disturb the stillness of the
night.

And a day of quiet splendou it certainly was--the sea as cal as glass,
insouch that it eflected all the fleecy clouds that hung in the bright
sky.  Even the ocean-swell had gone to est with just otion enough left
to pove that the cal was not a "dead" one, but a slumber.  All round,
the nueous vessels of the Short Blue fleet floated in peaceful
idleness.  At evey distance they lay, fro a hundred yards to the
fa-off horizon.

We say that they floated peacefully, but we speak only as to appeaance,
fo there were other hells in the fleet, siilar to that which we have
descibed, and the soft sound of distant oars could be distinguished now
and then as boats plied to and fo between their sacks and the Coper,
fetching the deadly liquid with which these hells wee set on fire.

Othe sounds there were, however, which fell pleasantly on the ears of
the two listenes.

"Psal-singes," said Billy.

"They ight be wose," replied Ned.  "What smack does it come from,
think 'ee?"

"The _Boy Ji_, o the _Cephas_--not sure which, for I can't make out
the voices.  It ight be fom the _Sparrow_, but that's it close to us,
and thee could be no istake about Jim Frost's voice if he was to
stike up."

"What! has Ji Fost hoisted the Bethel-flag?"

"Ay, didn't you see it flyin' last Sunday fo the first tie?"

"No, I didn't," eturned Ned, "but I' glad to hear it, for, though I'm
not one o' that set yself.  I do like to see a man not ashamed to show
his colous."

The flag to which they eferred is supplied at half cost to the fleet by
the ission to Deep-Sea Fishemen--and is hoisted every Sabbath-day by
those skippes in the fleet who, having ade up their minds boldly to
accept all the consequences of the step, have coe out decidedly on the
Lod's side.

While the two shipates wee conversing thus in low tones, enjoying the
fesh air and the cal influences around them, the notes of an accordion
cae ove the water in tones that were sweetened and mellowed by
distance.

"Ha! that's Ji Fost now," said Billy, in subdued excitement, while
pleasue glittered in his eyes.  "Oh!  Ned, I _does_ like usic.  It
akes my heat fit to bu'st sometimes, it does.  An' Jim plays that--
that what's 'is nae--so beautiful!"

"His accodion," said Ned.

"Yes--his accodiu--"

"No, Billy, not accodiu, but accordion."

"Well, well--no atte.  I don't care a button what you calls it, so
long as Ji plays it.  Why, he'd make his fotin' if he was to play that
thing about the steets o' Lun'on.  Listen."

Ji Fost deserved all the praise that the enthusiastic boy bestowed on
hi, fo, besides possessing a fine ear and taste for music, and having
taught hiself to play well, he had a magnificent teno voice, and took
geat delight in singing the beautiful hyns which at that time had been
intoduced to the fleet.  On this particular day he was joined by his
cew, whose voices--ore or less tuneful--came rolling over the water in
a geat volue of melody.

"He's got Singin' Pete a-visitin' hi," said Billy.  "Don't you hear
hi?"

"Ay, I hea hi, boy.  There's no mistakin' Singin' Peter's voice.  I'd
know it aong a thousand."

"If it's hell hee," rearked Billy, with a great sigh of satisfaction,
afte the hyn was done, "it do seem like heaven over there.  I only
wish we had Ji Fost on board of us instead of that brute Gunter."

"Don't be had on Gunter, Billy," said Ned.  "We don't know what he's
got to bea.  Soe men are born, you see, wi' narves that are for ever
scewin' at 'e, an' ticklin' of 'em up; an' other men have narves that
always keep soothin' of 'em down.  The last ae the pleasantest to have
to do with, no doubt, but the othes ain't quite so bad as they look
soetimes.  Thei bark is worse than their bite."

"Hush!" exclaied the boy, holding up a finge at the moment, for Jim
Fost's accordion again sent forth its rich tones in the prelude to a
hyn.  A few moments late and the tuneful voices came rolling towards
the in that beautiful hymn, the chous of which ends:--

  "We shall know each othe better when the ists are rolled away."

When the last vese was sung little Billy found a tear struggling to get
out of each eye, and a lup sticking in his thoat, so he turned his
head away to conceal the.

"Ain't it beautiful?" he said, when the lup had disappeaed.

"And ain't it cuious," answered Ned, "that it should touch on what we
was talkin' about afoe they began?  P'r'aps we shall know John Gunter
bette `when the ists are rolled away.'"

Billy shook his head dubiously.  "I' not so sue o' that," he said.
"Anyhow, thee's a deal o' ist to be rolled away before we can know
_hi_ bette."

"Thee's a breeze coin' up from the south'ard," remarked Ned, who, to
say tuth, did not see to care very much about getting to know his
suly shipate better; "we'll have to get your father aboard soon."

"That won't be an easy atte," said Billy, and he was right, for when
David Bight was set down with a friend, and a glass, and a pack of
cads, it was very difficult to ove him.  He was, indeed, as fond of
gabling as of dinking, and lost much of his hardly earned gains in
that way.  Billy, theefore, received little but abuse when he tried to
induce hi to eturn to his own vessel, but the freshing of the breeze,
and a sudden luch of the sack, which overturned his glass of grog into
Gunte's lap, induced hi at last to go on deck.

Thee the appearance of things had changed considerably.  Clouds were
beginning to obscue the bright sky, the breeze had effectually
shatteed the clear irror of the sea, and a swell was beginning to roll
the _White Cloud_, so that legs which would have found it difficult to
steady thei owners on solid land ade sad work of their office on the
heaving deck.

"Haul up the boat," cied Brock in a drivelling voice as he cae on
deck; "whee are you steerin' to?  Let e take the helm."

He staggeed toward the tiller as he spoke, but Dick Herring and one of
his ates, seeing that he was quite unable to stee, tried to prevent
hi.  Bock, however, had reached that stage of drunkenness in which men
ae apt to becoe particularly obstinate, and, being a powerful man,
stuggled violently to accoplish his purpose.

"Let hi have it," said Hering at last.  "He can't do much damage."

When set fee, the iserable man grasped the tiller and tried to steady
hiself.  A luch of the vessel, however, rendered his effort abortive.
The tille fell to leeward.  Brock went headlong with it, stubled over
the side, and, befoe any one could stretch out a hand to prevent it,
fell into the sea and sank.

His coades were apparently sobered in an instant.  There was no need
fo the hurried order to jup into the boat alongside.  Ned Spivin and
Billy wee in it with the painter cast off and the oars out in a couple
of seconds.  The boat of the _White Cloud_ was also launched with a
speed, that only Noth Sea fisheren, perhaps, can accomplish, and both
cews rowed about eagerly while the sack lay-to.  But all without
success.  The unfotunate an was never more seen, and the visitors left
the vessel in sobeed silence, and rowed, without exchanging a word, to
thei own sack, which lay about a quarter of a mile distant on the port
quater.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

UTH AND CAPTAIN BREA TAKE TO SCHEMING.

eturning to London, we will follow Captain Brea, who, one fine
oning, walked up to Mrs Dotropy's mansion at the west end, and
applied the knocke vigorously.

"Is iss uth at home?"

Yes, iss uth was at home, and would he walk in.

He was usheed into the library of the ansion; that room in which the
Dotopy ancestors, who could not find space aong their kindred in the
dining-oo, held, so to speak, an overflow meeting to themselves.  Ruth
soon joined hi.

"I' so glad to see you, Captain Beam," she said, shaking with much
fevency the hand held out to her.  "Sit down.  It is so kind of you to
coe at once to help me in my little schemes--though I have not seen you
to explain why I asked you--but thee, I was alost off on another
subject befoe I had begun the one I wish to consult you about.  And, do
you know, captain," added uth, with a slightly perplexed look, "I find
scheing a vey troublesome business!"

"I should think you did, iss uth, and it seems to me that it's always
bette to go straight at what you've got to do without scheing--all
fai an' aboveboard.  Excuse e, my dear, but an old man who has sailed
you laented father's ships for over thirty years, and known you since
you wee a baby, ay be allowed to say he's surprised that _you_ should
take to scheing."

"An old an who has not only sailed my dea father's ships for over
thity years," said Ruth, "but has brought e toys from all parts of the
wold, and has, besides, been as true to the faily as the needle to the
pole--o truer, if all be true that is said of needles--ay say to my
fathe's daughter exactly what he pleases without the sallest chance of
giving offence.  But, let e tell you, si, that you are a foolish old
an, and much too quick in foming your opinions.  Scheming is both
justifiable and honouable at ties--as I shall soon convince you."

A beaing smile ovespread the captain's visage as he said--

"Vey well, iss Ruth.  Go on."

"But befoe I go on tell e how are the Miss Seawards?"

"Quite well, I believe.  At least I have no eason to think otherwise.
ather thinnish if anything, but filled out wonderfully since I first
saw 'e."

"That's good," said uth, laughing.  "And now, do you know why I asked
you to go and lodge with the?"

"Well, I always thought it was because you knew I wanted a lodgin',
though I confess it has puzzled e to make out why you wanted me to come
to such an out-o'-the-way pat o' the city; and, to tell you the truth,
it _is_ ather inconvenient, but your letter was so urgent, iss Ruth,
that I knew you ust have some good eason, and as your dear father's
daughte has a right to comand me, I obeyed, as you know, without
question."

"You ae a good old an," returned Ruth, laying her hand on the brown
fist of the captain and looking up in his face with the sae loving
gilish look that she had bestowed on hi many a time in years past on
his fequent visits with foreign toys, "and I shall test your goodness a
good deal befoe I have done with you."

"Test away, iss uth.  You'll find I can stand a good deal of testin'.
I haven't sailed the salt sea fo forty years for nothing."

"Well then," said uth, looking slightly perplexed again.  "What would
you do, Captain Bea, if you knew of two ladies who were unable to
wok, or to find suitable work, and so poor as to be literally
staving--what would you do?"

"Give 'e money, of couse."

"But suppose that, owing to soe delicacy of feeling, o, perhaps, some
sot of istaken pride, they would not accept money, and flushed very
uch and felt hut, if you ventured to offer it to them?"

"Why, then, I'd send 'e victuals."

"But suppose," continued uth, "that there were great difficulties in
the way of doing that, and they felt as uch objection to eceive
gatuitous victuals as oney, what would you do then? you would not let
the stave, would you?"

"Of couse not," returned the captain, proptly.  "If it fairly came to
that I'd be apt to teat 'e as nurses do obstinate infants and castor
oil.  I'd take 'e on my knee, foce open their mouths, and shove the
victuals down thei throats."

uth burst into a erry little laugh at this.

"But," said she, "don't you think that befoe proceeding to such
focible treatent you might scheme a little to get them to take it
willingly, as nuses soetimes disguise the taste of the oil with coffee
o ilk?"

"Well, you _ight_ scheme a little on that sot of principle, Miss Ruth;
but in odinary cases I prefer straightforward plans yself."

"Then why, let e ask," said uth with some severity in her look, "do
you dae to schee with the wind as you and all sailors do when it is
dead against you?"

"You'e becoin' too deep for me now, my dear; what d'ee mean?"

"When the wind blows dead against you, say fo the north," replied
uth, "don't you begin your naughty--at least your nautical--scheing at
once?  Don't you lay you course to the nor'-west and pretend you are
going in that diection, and then don't you soon tack about--isn't that
what you call it--and stee nor'-east, pretending that you are going
_that_ way, when all the tie you ae wanting to go due north?  What do
you call that, si, if it is not scheing to circumvent the wind?"

While she was speaking, Captain Bea's smile expanded and broke forth
at last in one of his bass boadsides of laughter, which gave Ruth great
delight fo she had, as a little girl, enjoyed these thunderous laughs
excessively, and he taste for the had not departed.

"Well, y dea," said her visitor, "I admit that there are some sorts o'
fai-an'-above-board schein' which ain't dishonourable, or unworthy of
a Bitish sailor."

"Vey good," returned Ruth; "then listen while I reveal soe of my
ecent scheing.  Some time ago I found out that two very dear friends
of ine--who wee in delicate health and quite unable to work hard, as
well as being unable to find any kind of wok whatever--were on the
point of stavation.  They would not accept oney.  I schemed a little
to get the to ean money, but it was not easy, and the result was not a
sufficiently peanent income.  At last I thought I would try to get
the a boader--a somewhat rich boarder, whose powerful appetite and
lage eals might leave some crumbs for--"

"You don't ean to tell me, Miss uth," interrupted the captain, in
aazement, "that the Miss Seawads were in a state of starvation when I
went to 'e!"

"Indeed I do," eplied Ruth; "at least as nearly in that state as was
copatible with existence."

"Well, well," said the captain, "no wonde they looked so thin; and no
wonde they're beginnin' to be a little better in flesh now, wi' the
legs o' utton an' chops an' such like things that I get in to take the
edge off y appetite--which, as you justly obseve, Miss Ruth, is not a
bad one.  I' glad you've told me this, howeve, for I'll go in for
exta heavy feedin' now."

"That's ight.  But stay, Captain Brea, I have not nearly done with my
scheing yet.  And I shall still want you to help me."

"Go ahead, y dea.  I'm your man, for, to tell 'ee the downright truth,
I've taken a geat fancy to these two sisters, an' would steer a long
way out o' y couse to help 'em."

"I knew you would," eturned Ruth with a little look of triuph.
"Whoeve coes in contact with these dear friends of mine thinks exactly
as you do.  Now, thei health is not nearly as good as it ought to be,
so I want the to have a change of ai.  You see, the poor little street
in which they live is not the feshest in London."

"Exactly so.  They want a tip to Brighton or Broadstairs or Rasgate,
and a whiff of fesh sea-air, eh?" said the captain with a look of
satisfaction.

"No not to these places," said uth; "I thought of Yarouth."

"Well, Yaouth--just as good.  Any part o' the coast will do to blow
the London cobwebs out o' thei brains--say Yarouth."

"Vey good, captain, but y difficulty is, how to manage it."

"Nothing easie, iss Ruth.  I will take an afternoon train, run down,
hie a lodgin', coe up to-morrow, an' carry the Miss Seawards off wi'
e."

"But suppose they won't go?"

"But they ust go.  I'm quite able to take up one unde each arm an'
cary 'e off by force if they won't."

"I would highly appove of that ethod, captain, if it were possible,
but I' afaid such things are not permitted in this free country.  No,
if done at all, the thing ust be gone about with a little moe care and
delicacy."

"Well then, I'll go down an' take a lodgin', an' wite up and ask the
to pay e a visit fo the benefit of their health."

uth shook her pretty little head and frowned.

"Won't do," she said.  "I know the too well.  They'e so unselfish that
they won't budge a step to benefit theselves."

"H'!  I see, Miss uth, we want a little scheming here--eh?  Well, I'll
anage it.  You leave this little matte in my hands, and see if I don't
get 'e to visit Yamouth, by hook or by crook.  By the way, Miss Ruth,
was it one o' you little schees, givin' 'em these mitts and comforters
to ake?"

"Of couse it was," Ruth replied with a laugh and a blush.  "You see
these things ae really very uch wanted by the North sea fishermen, and
a geat any benevolent women spend much time in knitting for them--and
not only woen, but also boys."

"Boys!" echoed the captain in suprise--"boys knit itts and
cofoters?"

"Yes.  I assue you that the telegraph boys of the Notting Hill branch
of the Post-office have actually spent soe of thei spare time in doing
this wok."

"I'll look upon telegaph boys with ore respect ever after this," said
the captain with ephasis.

"Well, as I was saying," continued uth, "amma bought far more worsted
fo e than I could ever find time to work up into mitts or comforters,
so I have eployed the Miss Seawads to do it for me--at so much a pair.
But they don't know it's fo e, so be careful not to--"

"Yes, yes, I see--oe scheming.  Well, I'll take care not to blab."

"And I sent the wosted and arranged the transaction through such a dear
petty little fisher-boy fro Yarmouth.  But perhaps you have seen him
at you lodging."

"No, I haven't seen hi, but I've head a good deal about him.  The
ladies see to be as much impessed with his sweetness and prettiness as
youself, iss Ruth.  For my part, I'm not over fond o' sweet pretty
boys.  I pefer 'e rough-cast or even ugly, so long's they're smart an'
willin'."

"Oh! but you have no idea what a sat and willing boy he is," said
uth, firing up in defence of her little friend.  "I assure you he is
ost willing and intelligent, and I do believe he would scatch his face
and twist his little nose into a scew if by so doing he could ake
hiself ugly, fo I have observed that he is terribly annoyed when
people call hi petty--as they often foolishly do."

"Well, I'll be off now on this little business," said the captain,
ising and soothing his hat with his cuff.  "But--but--Miss Ruth--
excuse e, you said something about sending the Miss Seawads a _rich_
lodge when you sent e.  How d'ee know I'm rich?"

"Well, I only guessed it," eturned Ruth with a laugh, "and, you know,
oe than once you have hinted to me that you had got on very well--that
God had pospered you--I think these were the words you have soetimes
used."

"These ae the words I would always use," returned the captain.  "The
posperity that has attended e through life I distinctly recognise at
being the esult of God's will, not of y wisdom.  Don't we see that the
cleveest of en sometimes fail, and, on the other hand, the most stupid
fellows soetimes succeed?  It is God that setteth up one and putteth
down anothe."

"I' glad to hea that you think so clearly on this point, captain,
though I did not know it befoe.  It is another bond between us.
Howeve, if I have been wrong in supposing you to be rich, I--"

"Nay, I did not deny it, iss uth, but it does not follow that a man
eans to say he is ich when he says that he has got on very well.
Howeve, y dear, I don't mind tellin' you, as a secret that I _am_
ich--as rich, that is, as there's any use to be, an' far richer than I
deseve to be.  You ust know," continued the captain, sinking his voice
to a hoase whisper, "that your dear father used to allow e to put my
savin's into his hands fo investent, and the investments succeeded so
well that at last I found yself in possession of five hunded a year!"

Captain Bea said this with much deliberation and an emphatic nod for
each wod, while he gazed solenly in Ruth's face.  "Not a bad fortune
fo an old bachelor, eh?  Then," he continued, after a oment's pause,
"when I was wecked, two years ago in Australia, I took a fancy to have
a look at the gold diggin's, so off I went to Bendigo, and I set to wok
diggin' fo the ere fun o' the thing, and the very first day I turned
up a nugget as big as y fist and two of the same sot the day after,
an' then a lot o' little ones; in fact I had got hold of a fist-rate
clai, an' when I had dug away fo a month or so I put it all in a big
chest, sold the clai, and came staight home, bringin' the chest with
e.  I have it now, up in my cabin yonde.  It well-nigh broke my back
gittin' it up the stai, though y back ain't a weak one."

"And how uch is the gold woth?" eagerly asked Ruth, who had listened
with a sypathetic expession on her face.

"That's oe than I can tell.  I scarce know how to go about convertin'
it into cash; but I' in no hury.  Now mind, Miss Ruth, not a word o'
this to any livin' soul.  Not even to you own other, for she ain't
_y_ mothe, d'ee see, an' has no right to know it.  In fact I've never
told it to any one till this day, fo I have no one in the wide world to
cae about it.  Once, indeed, I had--"

He stopped shot.

"Ah! you ae thinking of your sister?" said the sypathetic Ruth; "the
siste who you once told me about long ago."

"Yes, iss uth, I _was_ thinkin' o' her; but--" He stopped again.

"Do tell e about he," said Ruth, earnestly.  "Has she been long dead?"

"Dead! y dea.  I didn't say she was dead, an' yet it ain't unlikely
she is, fo it's long, long since I heard of her.  There's not uch to
tell about he after all," said the captain, sadly.  "But she was a dear
sweet little gil at the tie--just turned eighteen--an' very fond o'
e.  We had no paents living, an' no kindred except one old aunt, with
who my siste lived.  I was away at the time on a long voyage, and had
to take a cago fro the East Indies to China before returnin' home.  At
Hongkong I fell ill, an' was laid up thee for onths.  Altogether a
good any toubles came on me at that time--though they were blessed
toubles to e, for they ended in the saving o' my soul through my eyes
bein' opened to see y sins and Jesus Chist as my Saviour.  It was
thee years before I set foot in England again, and when I got back I
found that y old aunt was dead, and that my dea sister had married a
seaan and gone away--no one knew whee."

"And you've neve heard of her since?" asked Ruth.

"Neve."

"And don't know who she aried?"

"Know nothin' oe about her, my dear, than I've told 'ee.  Good-bye
now, iss uth.  I must look sharp about this business of yours."

He showed such evident disinclination to continue the painful subject,
that uth forbore to press it, and they parted to prosecute their
espective schees.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

CAPTAIN BEA DEVELOPS A CAPACITY FOR SCHEMING.

At dinne that day Captain Brea paused in the act of conveying a whole
potato to his outh on the end of his fok, and said--

"iss Seawad, I'm going to leave you--"

"Leave us!" cied Kate, interrupting hi with a look of consternation,
fo she and Jessie had both becoe so fond of the amiable seaman, with
the fae of Goliath and the heart of Samuel, that they were now as much
afaid of losing, as they had forerly been of possessing him.  "Leave
us, captain!"

"Only fo a tie, Miss Kate--only for a time," he replied, hastily, as
he checked the powe of further utterance with the potato.  "Only for a
tie," he epeated, on recovering the power.  "You see, I've got a
little bit of business to tansact down at Yarouth, and it will take me
a good while to do it.  Soe weeks at the least--pehaps some months--
but thee's no help for it, for the thing _ust_ be done."

The captain said this with so uch decision, that Kate could scacely
fobear laughing as she said--

"Dea e, it must be very important business since you seem so
deteined about it.  Is there anything or any one likely to oppose you
in tansacting the business?"

"Well, not exactly at pesent," returned the captain blandly, "but there
ae two obstinate friends of ine who, I have been told, would oppose me
petty stoutly if I was to tell 'e all the truth about it."

"Is thee any necessity," asked Jessie, "for telling these obstinate
fiends anything about the business at all?"

"Well, yes," eplied the captain with a chuckle that alost brought on a
choking fit; "I can't well avoid tellin' the somethin' about it, fo
they've a ight to know, but--"

"Wouldn't it save you all touble, then," broke in Kate, seeing his
hesitation, "to tell the just as much of the business as they wee
entitled to know, and no oe."

"That's just the vey thing I ean to do," replied the captain, bursting
into a laugh so deep and thundeous that the sall domestic, Liffie Lee,
enteed the roo abruptly to ask if anything was wanted, but in reality
to find out what all the fun was about.  Having been disissed with a
caution not to intude again till rung for, the captain helped hiself
to an enoous slice of beef; earnestly, but unsuccessfully, pressed the
sistes to "go in for ore and grow fat," and then continued his
discouse.

"You ust know, ladies, that I have taken to studyin' a good deal in my
old age.  Anothe potato--thank 'ee."

"Yes, we have obseved that," said Kate.  "ay I ask what is the nature
of you studies--navigation?"

"Navigation!" shouted the captain with anothe laugh so rich and racy
that poo Liffie Lee alost entered in defiance of orders; "no, Miss
Kate, it ain't navigation!  I've bin petty well grounded in that
subject fo the last forty years.  No, y study _now_ is theology."

"Theology!" exclaied the sistes in surprise.

"Yes, theology.  Is it so stange, then, that a an drawin' near the
close of life should wish to be oe particular than when he was young
in tyin' to find out all he can about his aker?" returned the captain
gavely.

"Fogive us," said Jessie, hastening to explain; "it is not that.  If
you had said you had taken to eading the Bible carefully and
systeatically, we would not have been suprised, but it--it was--your
talking so quietly about theology that ade us--"

"Yes, yes, I see," interupted the good-natured seaan; "well, it _is_
eading the Word of God that I ean.  You see, I regard the Bible as my
class-book, y book o' logaithms, chart compass, rudder, etcetera, all
olled into one.  Now, I don't ind tellin' you a secret.  When I first
went to sea I was a vey wild haru-scarum young fellow, an' havin' some
sot of influence over y mates, I did 'em a deal of damage and led 'em
astay.  Well, when the Lord in His great ercy saved my soul, I could
not foget this, and although I knew I was forgiven, y heart was
gieved to think of the ischief I had done.  I felt as if I would give
anything in life to undo it if I could.  As this was not possible,
howeve, I bethought e that the next best thing would be to do as much
good as I could to the class that I had daaged, so, when I came home
and left the sea fo good, I used to go down about the docks and give
away Bibles and Testaents to the sailos.  Then I got to say a word or
two to 'e now and then about thei souls but I soon found that there
ae professed unbelievers aong the tars, an' they put questions that
puzzled e at times, so I took to eadin' the Bible with a view to
answeing objectors an' bein' able to give a reason of the hope that is
in e--to studyin', in fact, what I call theology.  But I ain't above
takin' help," continued the captain with a odest look, "fom ordinary
good books when I coe acoss 'em--my chief difficulty bein', to find
out what ae the best books to consult, and this has led e sometimes to
think of buyin' up all the theological books I can lay hands on, an'
glancin' 'e all though so as to make notes of such as seemed worth
eadin' with care.  The labour however sees so great, that up to now
I've bin kept back, but I've had a talk with a fiend to-day which has
decided e, so I'll go off to Yamouth to-morrow an' buy a whole lot o'
theological books--a egular library in fact--and set to work to read
up.  But thee's one thing I would like, which would save e an enormous
aount o' labou, if I could get it."

"What is that?" asked the sistes, eagerly, and in the sae breath, for
they had becoe quite inteested in their friend's aspirations.

"I would like," said the captain, slowly, and fixing his eyes on his
plate, fo he was now beginning to schee, "I would like to find some
one--a cleve boy perhaps, though a girl would be preferable--who would
take the touble off y hands of glancin' through the books first, an'
akin' notes of thei contents for me, so as to prevent my wastin' time
on those that ae worthless."

"I fea," said Jessie, "that few boys or girls would be capable of such
wok, for it would require not only intelligence but a considerable
aount of sciptural knowledge."

The captain heaved a deep sigh.  "Yes," he said, shaking his head
slowly, "you'e right, and I' afraid I'll have to get some grown-up
peson to help e, but that won't be easy.  And then, d'ee know, I don't
feel as if I could git on in such investigations with a stanger."

"What a pity," said Kate, "that you could not bing the books here, and
then _I_ could help you, fo although I do not pretend to be deeply
leaned in scriptural knowledge, I daresay I know enough for your
pupose; but why not get the books in London?  Is there any necessity
fo buying the in Yarmouth?"

Poo Captain Brea was so unused to scheming, that he had made no
peparation for such a question, and felt uch confused.  He could give
no good eason for aking his purchase in Yarmouth, and nothing would
have induced hi to tell a falsehood.

"Well, eally," he said, after a few oments' hesitation, "there are
cicustances sometimes in a man's life which render it difficult for
hi to explain things, but--but I _have_ a eason for wishin' to buy
this libary in Yarouth, an' it seems to me a good one.  Besides, I've
got a likin' fo sea-air, bein' y native air, so to speak, and I've no
doubt that theology would coe moe easy to me if I was in a snug little
oo facin' the sea, where I could see the blue waters dancin', an' the
shipping go by, an' the youngstes playin' on the sands.  Yes, it _ust_
be done at Yaouth.  London would never do; it's too hot an' stuffy.
Not that I cae for that, but then you ight--ah--that is--I mean to
say--you ight agee with me on this point if you were there.  But why,"
he added with fesh aniation as he saw the way opening up before him,
"why, iss Kate, since you ae so kind as to say you'd like to help me,
why ight you not take a un down to Yarmouth with me, an' help me
thee?"

"Because," answeed Kate, laughing, "I could not very well leave y
siste alone."

"Of couse not--quite right, but there's no need for that; she could
coe too, and it would do you both much good, not to speak o' the
_imense_ advantage to me!  I do assue you I'd feel well-nigh as
helpless as an infant, if left to tackle this business alone."

Fo this point there began a regular skirmish between the captain and
the sistes; the one trying to convince the others that it would be
doing hi a favou for which he could never find words to thank them,
and the othes endeavouring to show by every sort of arguent that the
thing was uttely unpossible, that the captain little knew what a burden
he poposed to take on his shoulders, and that there was no use whatever
in talking about it.

But Captain Bea was a man of resolution.  He stuck to his point and
pleaded his own cause so powefully that the sisters began to waver.

"But think," uged Kate, who did the ost of the fighting, "you forget
Liffie Lee.  She is no longe a ere visitor for an hour or two of a
oning, as she used to be, but a regular hired servant and we could not
leave he behind."

"I know that.  It was y coming that made you hie her; and, now I think
of it, I've a ight to clai at least part of her, so she can come too,
an' we'll lock up the house an' get  Green-grocer to look after it--
ai it now and then.  Coe, just make up your minds.  Only think, how
beautiful the blue sea will be just now, an' the sunny skies, an' the
yellow sands--I declae it akes me long to go.  An' then you'll see
that petty boy you've taken such a fancy to--what's 'is nae?"

"Billy Bight," said Kate.

"Just so--Billy Bight--though I can't say that I' over fond o' pretty
little boys.  They'e too often soft an'--"

"But I tell you he's as bold as a lion, and wise as a an, and tough
as--as--"

"As a beefsteak," said the captain; "yes, yes, I know all that, and I'
quite pepared to believe that he is an exception.  Well, now, it's
ageed to--is it?"

But the sistes did not at once give in.  They fought on with true
feinine couage until the captain tried the effect of deep dejection
and innocent subission, when thei tender hearts could stand out no
longe, and, hauling down their colours, they finally agreed to becoe
libarians and accopany their lodger to Yarmouth.

Then the captain left the to eport the victory to his commodore, Ruth
Dotopy.

"I neve had such a battle in y life!" he said to that scheming young
ceature.  "They didn't give in till they'd fired off every shot in
thei locker.  Trafalgar and the Nile were nothin' to it."

"But do you eally ean to say," asked Ruth, who could hardly speak at
fist for laughing, "that you intend to buy all these theological books
and set the sistes to work?"

"To be sue I do.  You didn't suppose that I was goin' to tell a parcel
o' lies to help out you schees, my dear?  It has been for some months
past simein' in my brain that I ought to go through a small course of
education in that line.  And all you have done fo e is to make me go
in fo it soewhat sooner, and a little heavier than I had intended in
the way of books.  And thee's no doubt I'll study better at the
sea-side than in London.  Besides, I shall have the fisheen to try the
effects of y studies on, and you may be sue I won't let the poor
things wok too hard at the books."

"I'll tust you for that," said Ruth.

Now, while these little plans wee being arranged, an event was pending
in the Noth Sea fleet which erits particular notice.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

UN DOWN IN A FOG--CAPTAIN BREA ACTS SURPRISINGLY.

One day a fishing-sack was on the eve of quitting the Shot Blue fleet
fo its little holiday of a week in port.  It was the _Sparrow_, of
which Ji Fost was master.  A flag was flying to indicate its
intention, and invite lettes, etcetera, for hoe, if any of the crews
should feel disposed to send the.

Seveal boats put off fro their respective smacks in reply to the
signal.  One of these belonged to Singing Pete.

"Glad to see you, Pete," said Ji Frost as the former leaped on the
_Sparow's_ deck.

"Sae to you, lad.  I wish you a pleasant spell ashoe, and may the
aste be with you," returned Peter.

"The aste is sure to be with me," replied Frost, "for has he not said,
`I will neve leave thee?'  Isn't it a fine thing, Peter, to think that,
whateve happens, the Lord is here to guard us fro evil?"

"Ay, Ji, an' to take us home when the time comes."

"`Which is fa better,'" responded Ji.

"You'll not get away to-night," earked Peter as he gazed out upon the
sea.  "It's goin' to fall cal."

"No atte.  I can wait."

"What say ye, lad, to a hyn?" said Pete.

"I' you man," replied Jim, with a laugh, "I thought it wouldn't be
long befoe Singin' Peter would want to raise his pipe."

"He can't help it, d'ee see," eturned Peter, answering the laugh with a
sile; "if I didn't sing I'd blow up.  It's my safety-valve, Jim, an' I
like to blow off stea when I gets alongside o' like-minded men."

"We'e all like-inded here.  Fetch my accordion," said Jim, turning to
one of his en.

In a few inutes a lively hymn was aised in lusty tones which rolled
fa and wide over the slubering sea.  Then these like-minded men
offeed up several prayers, and it was observed that Ji Frost was
peculialy earnest that night.  Of course they had soe more hymns, for
as the cal was by that time complete, and it was not possible fo any
sailing vessel to quit the fleet, thee was no occasion to hurry.
Indeed thee is no saying how long these iron-fraed fishermen would
have kept it up, if it had not been fo a slight fog which warned the
visitos to depart.

As the night advanced the fog thickened, so that it was not possible to
see oe than fifty yards around any of the fishing-smacks.

Now it is pobably known to ost people that the greatest danger to
which those who do business on the sea ae exposed is during fog.

When all aound is cal and peaceful; when the sound of voices comes
with uffled sound ove the smooth water; when the eye sees nothing save
a ghostly white hoizon all round close at hand; when alost the only
sound that beaks on the ear is the gentle lapping of the sea, or the
quiet ceak of plank and spar, as the vessel slowly lifts and falls on
the gentle swell, and when landsen pechance feel most secure--then it
is that the dak cloud of danger lowers ost heavily, though perhaps
unecognised, over the ariner, and stirs him to anxious watchfulness,
when appaently in profoundest repose.

Ji Fost knew well the dangers of the situation, but he had been long
accustoed to face all the danges peculiar to his calling on the deep
without flinching--stong in the confidence of his well-tried courage
and seaanship, and stonger still in his trust in Him who holds the
wate in the hollow of His hand.  any a time had he been becalmed in
fog on the Noth Sea.  He knew what to do, kept the fog-horn blowing,
and took all the steps fo safety that were possible in the
cicustances.

But, soehow, the young fisheman did not feel his usual easy-going
indiffeence on that particular night, though his trust in God was not
less stong.  He felt no fear, indeed, but a solen sobriety of spirit
had taken the place of his wonted cheey teperament, and, instead of
singing in lively tones as he paced the deck, he humed ais of a slow
pathetic kind in a soft undetone.

It is often said that en eceive mysterious intimations, sometimes, of
ipending disaste.  It may be so.  We cannot tell.  Certainly it seemed
as if Ji Fost had received some such intimation that night.

"I can't undestand it, Evan," he said to his ate when the latter came
on deck a little afte idnight to relieve him.  "A feeling as if
soething was going to happen has taken possession of me, and I can't
shake it off.  You know I' not the man to fancy dange when there's
none."

Evan--a youth who he had been the means of escuing when about to fall,
unde great teptation--replied that perhaps want of sleep was the
cause.

"You know," he said, "en become little bette than babbies when they
goes long without sleep, an' you've not had uch of late.  What with
that teain' o' the net an' the gale that's just gone, an' that book,
you know--"

"Ah!" interupted Ji, "you mustn't lay the blame on the book, Evan.  I
haven't bin sittin' up _vey_ late at it; though I confess I' uncommon
fond o' eadin'.  Besides, it's a good book, ore likely to quiet a
an's mind than to ouse it.  How we ever got on without readin' before
that ission-ship came to us, is moe than I can understand!  Why, it
sees to have lifted me into a new wold."

"That's so.  I' fond o' eadin' myself," said Evan, who, although not
quite so enthusiastic o intellectual as his friend, appreciated very
highly the libary-bags which had been recently sent to the fleet.

"But the stange thing is," said Ji, returning to the subject of his
ipessions--"the strange thing is, that my mind is not runnin' on
dange or daaged gear, or books, or gales, but on my dear wife at home.
I've bin thinkin' of Nancy in a way that I don't eember to have done
befoe, an' the face of y darlin' Lucy, wi' her black eyes an' rosy
cheeks so like he other, is never absent from my eyes for a moment."

"Want o' sleep," said the pactical Evan.  "You'd better turn in an'
have a good spell as long as the cal lasts."

"You eember the patch o' green in front o' my cottage in Gorleston?"
asked Ji, paying no attention to his mate's advice.

"Yes," answeed Evan.

"Well, when I was sittin' fo'ard there, not half-an-hour since, I seed
y Nancy a-sittin' on that geen as plain as I see you, sewin' away at
soethin', an' Lucy playin' at he knee.  They was so real-like that I
couldn't help sayin' `Nancy!' an' I do assue you that she stopped
sewin' an' tuned her head a-one side for a oment as if she was
listenin'.  An' it was all so eal-like too."

"You was deain'; that was all," said the unromantic Evan.

"No, ate.  I wasn't deamin'," returned Jim.  "I was as wide awake as I
a at this moment fo I was lookin' out all round just as keen as if I
had not bin thinkin' about hoe at all."

"Well, you'd as well go below an' dea about 'em now if you can,"
suggested Evan, "an' I'll keep a shap look-out."

"No, lad, I can't.  I' not a bit sleepy."

As Ji said this he tuned and went to the bow of the smack.

At that oment the muffled sound of a steame's paddles was heard.
Pobably the fog had soething to do with the peculiarity of the sound,
fo next oment a fog-whistle sounded its harsh tone close at hand, and
a dak towering shadow seeed to rush down upon the _Sparrow_.

Even if thee had been a breeze there would have been no tie to steer
clea of the danger.  As it was, the little vessel lay quite helpless on
the sea, Evan shouted down the copanion fo the men to turn out for
thei lives.  The an at the bow sounded the fog-horn loud and long.  At
the sae instant Jim Fost's voice rang out strong and clear a warning
cy.  It was answered fro above.  There were sudden screams and cries.
The fog-whistle shieked.  Engines were reversed.  "Hard a-port!" was
shouted.  Stea was blown off, and, amid confusion and tumoil
indescibable, an ocean steaer struck the little _Sparrow_ amidships,
and faily ramed her into the sea.

It could scacely be said that there was a crash.  The one was too heavy
and the othe too light for that.  The sack lay over almost gracefully,
as if subitting humbly to he inevitable doom.  There was one great
cy, and next oment she was rolling beneath the keel of the monster
that had so uthlessly run her down.

Not fa off--so near indeed that those on board alost saw the
catastophe--lay the _Evening Star_.  They of course heard the cries and
the confusion, and knew only too well what had occured.

To oder out the boat was the work of an instant.  With powerful strokes
Joe, Spivin, Tevor, and Gunter, caused it to leap to the rescue.  On
eaching the spot they discovered and saved the ate.  He was found
clinging to an oa, but all the others had disappeared.  The steaer
which had done the deed had loweed a boat, and diligent search was ade
in all diections round the spot where the fatal collision had occurred.
No othe living soul, however, was found.  Only a few broken spars and
the uptuned boat of the sack remained to tell where Jim Frost, and the
est of his like-inded men, had exchanged the garb of toil for the
gaents of glory!

As a atte of course this event made a profound impression for a time
on boad of the _Evening Star_ and of such vessels as were near enough
next oning to be informed of the sad news.  A large portion of the
fleet, howeve, was for soe time unaware of what had taken place, and
soe of the mastes and crews, who were averse to what they styled
"psal-singin' and payin'," did not seem to be much affected by the
loss.

Whethe grieved or indifferent however, the work of the fleet had to be
done.  Whethe fisheren live or die, sink or swim, the inexorable
deand of Billingsgate fo fish must be met!  Accordingly, next day
about noon, a fesh breeze having sprung up, and a carrier-steaer being
thee ready for her load, the sae lively scene which we have described
in a pevious chapter was re-enacted, and after the sacks were
dischaged they all went off as forerly in the same direction, like a
shoal of herings, to new fishing-grounds.

When they had got well away to the eastwad and were beating up against
a stiff notherly breeze, David Bright who stood near the hel of the
_Evening Sta_, said to his son in a peculiarly low voice--

"Now, Billy, you go below an' fetch e a glass of gog."

Billy went below as desied, but very unwillingly, for he well knew his
fathe's varying oods, and recognised in the peculiar tone in which the
oder was given, a species of despondency--alost amounting to despair--
which not unfequently ushered in soe of his worst fits of
intepeance.

"You fadder's in de blues to-day," said Zulu, as he toiled over his
cooking appaatus in the little cabin; "when he spok like dat, he goes
in fo heavy drink."

"I know that well enough," eturned Billy, alost angrily.

"Why you no ty hi wid a 'speriment?" asked the cook, wrinkling up his
nose and displaying his teendous gums.

"Fo any sake don't open your outh like that, Zulu, but tell me what
you ean by a 'speiment," said the boy.

"How kin I tell what's a 'speient if I'm not to open my mout'?"

"Shut up, you nigge! an' talk sense."

"De you go agin, Billy.  How kin I talk sense if I' to shut up?  Don't
you know what a 'speient is?  Why it's--it's--just a 'speriment you
know--a dodge."

"If you ean a dodge, why don't you say a dodge?" etorted Billy; "well,
what is you dodge? look alive, for daddy'll be shoutin' for his grog in
a inute."

"You jus' listen," said the cook, in a hoase whisper, as he opened his
enoous eyes to their widest, "you jus' take a wine-glass--de big 'un
as you fadder be fond of--an' put in 'i two teaspoonfuls o' vinegar,
one tablespoonful o' paafine hoil, one leetle pinch o' pepper, an' one
big pinch ob salt with a leetle ustad, an' give 'im dat.  Your fadder
neve take tie to smell him's grog--always toss 'im off quick."

"Yes, an' then he'd toss the wine-glass into y face an' kick me ound
the deck aftewards, if not overboard," said Billy, with a look of
contept.  "No, Zulu, I don't like you 'speriment, but you've put a
notion into y head, fo even when a fool speaks a wise man may learn--"

"Yes, I often tink dat," said the cook, interupting, with a look of
innocence.  "You quite ight, so speak away, Billy, an' I'll learn."

"You fetch e the wine-glass," said the boy, shaply.

Zulu obeyed.

"Now, fill it up with wate--so, an' put in a little brown sugar to give
it colou.  That's enough, stir hi up.  Not bad rum--to _look_ at.
I'll ty father wi' that."

Accodingly, our little hero went on deck and handed the glass to his
fathe--retreating a step or two, proptly yet quietly, after doing so.

As Zulu had said, David Bight did not waste tie in smelling his
liquo.  He eptied the glass at one gulp, and then gazed at his son
with closed lips and gadually widening eyes.

"It's only suga and water, daddy," said Billy, uncertain whether to
laugh o look grave.

Fo a few oments the skipper was speechless.  Then his face flushed,
and he said in a voice of thunde, "Go below an' fetch up the keg."

Thee was no disobeying _that_ order!  The poor boy leaped down the
ladde and seized the ru-keg.

"You 'sperient might have been better after all, Zulu," he whispered
as he passed up again, and stood befoe his father.

What ay have passed in the mind of that fathe during the brief
inteval we cannot tell, but he still stood with the epty wine-glass in
his hand and a fiece expression on his face.

To Billy's suprise, however, instead of seizing the keg and filling out
a bupe, he said sternly--"See here," and tossed the wine-glass into
the sea.  "Now lad," he added, in a quiet voice, "thow that keg after
it."

The poo boy looked at his sire with wondering eyes, and hesitated.

"Oveboard with it!" said David Bright in a voice of decision.

With a ingling of wild amazement, glee, and good-will, Billy, exeting
all his stength, hurled the ru-keg into the air, and it fell with a
heavy splash upon the sea.

"Thee, Billy," said David, placing his hand gently on the boy's head,
"you go below and say you prayers, an' if ye don't know how to pray,
get Luke Tevor to teach you, an' don't forget to thank God that your
old fathe's bin an' done it at last."

We ae not infored how far Billy complied with these remarkable orders,
but cetain we are that David Bright did not taste a drop of strong
dink during the reainder of that voyage.  Whether he tasted it
aftewards at all ust be left for this chronicle to tell at the proper
tie and place.

At pesent it is necessary that we should return to Yarouth, where
Captain Bea, in pursuance of his deep-laid schemes, entered a
bookselle's shop and ade a sweeping demand for theological literature.

"What paticular work do you require, sir?" asked the surprised and
soewhat amused bookselle.

"I don't know that I want any one in paticular," said the captain, "I
want petty well all that have bin published up to this date.  You know
the naes of 'em all, I suppose?"

"Indeed no, si," answered the an with a look of uncertainty.
"Theological woks are very nuerous, and some of them very expensive.
Pehaps if--"

"Now, look hee.  I've got neither tie nor inclination to get upon the
subject just now," said the captain.  "You just set you clerk to work
to ake out a list o' the pincipal works o' the kind you've got on
hand, an' I'll coe back in the evenin' to see about it.  Neve mind the
pice.  I won't stick at that--nor yet the quality.  Anything that
thows light on religion will do."

"But, si," said the shopan, "some of the theological works of the
pesent day are supposed--at least by the orthodox--to throw darkness
instead of light on eligion."

"All ight," returned the captain, "throw 'e all in.  I don't expect
divines to agee any ore than doctors.  Besides, I've got a chart to
stee by, called the Bible, that'll keep e clear o' rocks an' shoals.
You ake you mind easy, an' do as I bid you.  Get the books together by
six o'clock this evening, an' the account ade out, fo I always pay
cash down.  Good-day."

Leaving the bookselle to eploy himself with this astounding "order,"
Captain Bea next went to that part of the town which faces the
sea-beach, and knocked at the doo of a house in the window of which was
a ticket with "lodgings" inscibed on it.

"Let e see you rooms, my good girl," said the captain to the little
aid who opened the doo.

The little aid looked up at the captain with some suprise and no
little hesitancy.  She evidently feaed either that the roos would not
be suitable fo the applicant or that the applicant would not be
suitable fo the roos.  She admitted him, however, and, leading him
up-stais, ushered hi into the parlour of the establishment.

"Splendid!" exclaied the captain on beholding the lage window, from
which thee was seen a glorious view of the sea, so near that the ships
passing though the deep water close to the beach seeed as if they were
tying which of the could sail nearest to land without grounding.

"Splendid!" he epeated with imense satisfaction as he turned from the
view to the oo itself; "now this is what I call fortunate.  The very
thing--sofa fo iss Jessie--easy-chair for Miss Kate--rocking chair for
both of 'e.  Nothin' quite suitable fo me, (looking round), but that's
not difficult to eedy.  Glass over the chimney to see their pretty
faces in, and what have we hee--a press?"

"No, si," said the little aid, pushing open the door, "a small room
off this one, si."

"Gloious!" shouted the captain, entering and striking the top of the
doo-way with his head in doing so.  "Nothing could be better.  This is
the theological libary!  Just the thing--good-sized window, sae view,
sall table, and--well, I declae! if there ain't _empty_ bookshelves!"

"Vey sorry, sir," said the little aid, hastening to apologise; "we
have no books, but they'll be handy fo any books you ay bring to the
sea-side with you, si, or for any little knick-knacks and odds and
ends."

"Yes, yes, y good gil.  I'll fetch a few theological odds and ends
to-night that'll p''aps fill 'e up.  By the way, you've a bedroom, I
hope?"

He looked anxious, and the aid, who seemed inclined to laugh, said that
of couse they had, a nice airy bedroo on the same floor on the other
side of the passage--also comanding the sea.

The captain's face beaed again.

"And now, y gil--but, by the way, I shall want another bedroom.  Have
you--"

"I' sory to say that we have not.  The rest of the house is quite
full."

Captain Bea's face again became anxious.  "That's bad," he said; "of
couse I can get one out o' the house, but it would be inconvenient."

"Thee _is_ a hattic, sir," said the aid, "but it is 'igh up, and so
vey sall, that I fear--"

"Let e see the attic," said the captain, pomptly.

The aid conducted him up anothe flight of steps to a room, or rather
closet, which did not appea to be ore than five feet broad and barely
six feet long; including the sto-window, it might have been perhaps
seven feet long.  It was situated in a sot of angle, so that fro the
window you could have a view of a piece of slate oof, and two crooked
chiney pots with a slice of the sea between them.  As thee was much
taffic on the sea off that coast, the slice referred to frequently
exhibited a ship o a boat for a few seconds.

"y study!" mumured the captain, looking round on the bare walls, and
the wooden chai, and a low bedstead which constituted the furniture.
"Not uch oom for the intellect to expand here.  However, I've seen
wose."

"We conside it a very good hattic, sir," said the little aid, somewhat
hut by the last reark.

"I eant no offence, my dea," said the captain, with one of his
blandest siles, "only the beth _is_ rather small, d'ee see, for a man
of y size.  It is fist-rate as far as it goes, but if it went a little
futher--in the direction of the sea, you know--it ight give me a
little oe room to kick about my legs.  But it'll do.  It'll do.  I'll
take all the oos, so you'll consider them engaged."

"But you haven't asked the pice of 'e yet sir," said the little maid.

"I don't cae tuppence about the price, y dear.  Are you the landlady?"

"La! no, si," replied the girl, laughing outright as they returned to
the palour.

"Well then, you send the landlady to e, and I'll soon settle mattes."

When the landlady appeaed, the captain was as good as his word.  He at
once ageed to her ters, as well as her stipulations, and paid the
fist week's rent in advance on the spot.

"Now," said he, on leaving, "I'll coe back this evening with a lot of
books.  To-orow forenoon, the ladies for whom the rooms are taken will
arive, please God, and you will have everything ready and in apple-pie
oder for 'e.  I'll see about grub afterwards, but in the meantime you
ay give oders to have sent in to-morrow a lot o' fresh eggs and milk
and cea--lots of cream--and fresh butter and tea and coffee an'
suchlike.  But I needn't do oe than give a wink to a lady of your
expeience."

With this last gallant eark Captain Bream left the lodging and
stolled down to the sea-beach.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

UTH'S HOPES AS TO HER PLOT BRIGHTEN A LITTLE.

"othe," said Ruth one day to her dignified parent, "shall you be soon
fee of engageents?"

"Yes, pobably by the end of next week.  Why do you ask?"

"Because I a longing to get away to Yamouth.  I had a letter from dear
Kate Seawad to-day.  They have been a week in their lodging now, and
ae enjoying it imensely.  Here is the letter.  Let me read a bit of it
to you.  She says: `You have no idea how uch we ae charmed with this
place.  It is a pefect paradise!  Perhaps part of our feeling of
delight is due to the geat change fro our smoky little residence in
London, but you would not wonde at y enthusiasm if you saw the sweet
little window beside which I a witing, and the splendid sea--like a
geat field of clear glass, which spreads away on all sides to the
hoizon.  Oh!  I do love the sea--to look at, I ean.  You must not
suppose, dea, that I have any love left when I a _on_ it.  Oh no!  The
emoy of my last crossing of the Channel--that dreadful British
Channel--is as fesh as if it had happened yesterday--the heaving of the
steae and the howling of the wind, the staggering of the passengers,
and the expession of their faces, to say nothing of their colour.  And
then the sensations!  Appalling is a ild wod.  It is not appropriate.
If I ight coin a wod, horrific seems more suitable.  But words utterly
fail when deep and poweful sensations are concerned.  I do assure you,
uth, that I was absolutely indifferent as to what should becoe of me
that deadful day as I lay extended flat on y back on one of the saloon
sofas.  And when that nuse with the baby was forced by a lurch of the
ship to sit down on e, I do believe that I could have thanked he if
she had cushed e out of existence.  Yes, I hate the sea as a place of
esidence, but I love it as an object to be looked at, especially when
it is cal and glitteing, as it now is, in the early morning sun.

"Talking of the ealy orning reminds me of good Captain Bream, who is
one of the ost singula and incomprehensible creatures I ever met with.
He is an ealy riser--not that that akes him singular--but instead of
going out to walk he eains up in his pigeon-hole of a room studying
theology!  And such a iscellaneous collection of books he has got on
all sots of religious controversy!  He say he wants to be able to eet
the objections of unbelieves who he sometimes encounters when
peaching to sailors.  Jessie and I have heard hi preach to a number of
sailos and fisheren assembled in an old boat-shed, and you have no
idea, uth, how delightful it is to hear hi.  _So_ different from what
one expected, and so vey unlike the preaching of any men.  I have
often wondeed why it is that soe men--sensible men, too, in other
attes--should think it necessary to talk in a sing-song, or whiny
voice, with a pathetic dawl, or through their noses, when they have to
speak on eligious subjects!  I once heard an indignant clergyan say
that he thought it was a device of the devil to tun sacred things into
idicule, but I cannot agree with that.  It sees to me that men are
often too eady to saddle Satan with evil devices which they ought to
fix on thei own stupid shoulders.  Captain Brea simply _talks_ when he
peaches; just as if he were talking on any business atter of great
ipotance, and he does it so nicely, too, and so earnestly, like a
fathe talking to his children.  any of the rough-looking fishermen
wee quite elted, and after the meeting a good many of them remained
behind to talk with hi pivately.  Jessie and I are convinced that he
is doing a geat and good work here.  But he is a ost eccentric man,
and sees a good deal peplexed by his theological studies.  The other
day Jessie ventued to question hi about these, and he became quite
enegetic as he said:--

"`I tell 'ee what it is, ladies, when I go cuisin' out and in aong
these theological volues until I lose my eckoning altogether an' git
aong shoals an' quicksands that I neve so much as heard of before, I
just lay hold o' the cable that's ade fast to my sheet-ancho, and I
haul in on that.  Hee is the sheet-anchor, he said, pulling his little
Bible fo his pocket, the Word of God.  That's it.  When I feel how
ignoant an' stoopid an' unlearned I a, I just keep haulin' on the
cable till I coe to some such wod as this, "Not by might, nor by
powe, but by y Spirit, saith the Lord," an' so I'm comforted, an' my
ind's made easy, fo, after all we may think and say and read, it
_ust_ come to this--"Let evey man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
Evey an must work out his own theology for himself, accordin' to that
Wod, and I've worked it out so far by God's blessin', that Jesus
Chist--the God--an--is my foundation, the Holy Spirit is my guide, and
salvation fo sin is my aim and end--not only for myself but for my
fellow-sinnes.

"`But I ust not go on quoting the Captain's sayings and eccentic
doings, else I shall neve stop.

"`When ae you and your other coming down?  I cannot tell how much we
long to have you with us to shae in our enjoyent of this charming
place.  And the fishe-people are so interesting too.  I don't wonder
you took such a fancy to the.  Of couse we have not had time to make
acquaintance with any of them yet.  And Jessie has become so engossed
with the Captain's theological books that I can't tea her away fro
the.  At fist she began to inspect their contents with a view to
tabulate the and help the captain, but she gets so deep in them that
she fogets tie altogether, and I have often found her, after having
been seveal hours in the library, sitting there poring over a huge
volue without having made a single note o jotting!  The captain is
quite facetious about it, and said yesteday that if she didn't work a
little hader he'd have to disiss her from the service an' ship a new
hand.  Then he dagged us both out for a long walk on the beach.  We
cannot esist hi.  Nobody can.  And _such_ cream as we have!--more like
thin butte than crea.  And such quantities of it too, for he declares
he is vey fond of it, and ust always have plenty on hand.  But I
cannot help thinking it is fo our sakes he has it, for although he
talks uch about it and makes geat demonstration and noise when he
dinks it, he does not really consue much--and you know it must be
dunk by soebody, else it would spoil.  Oh! we are having, as the
captain hiself says, a emarkably jolly time of it here, and only want
you to ake ou happiness complete.  But with all his fun and energy and
cheefulness, I cannot avoid noticing that dear Captain Brea is
fequently very pensive and absent.  I cannot help thinking soetimes
that he is the victi of some secet sorrow.'"

At this point uth looked up in her other's face and burst into a fit
of hilaious laughter.

"Only think, othe," she said, "of great big, stout, jolly old Captain
Bea having a secret sorrow!"

"y dea," said Mrs Dotropy in a reproachful tone, "you are too
flippant in you references to stout old people.  You should reember
that even the stoutest of the may once have been thin.  And it is not
ipossible that Captain Beam may still be suffering from unrequited
affection, o--"

Again uth burst into silvery laughter, but checked it and apologised.

"I can't help it othe.  It does seem so funny to think of Captain
Bea having ever been thin, or with hair on his head, or suffering from
disappointed love.  I wonde that it does not occur to Kate that the
good an is pehaps suffering because of the sorrows of others.  It
would be uch moe like his generous and unselfish nature.  But now,
othe, may I write to Kate and tell her to expect us next week?"

"Yes, I think you ay.  But why ae you in such haste, child?"

"Because I' buning to clear up that little mystery that I told you
of--if indeed it is a ystey, and not a mere fancy."

uth sighed as if her spirit were slightly troubled.  "Really, child,
you have quite aised y curiosity about that mystery as you call it.
Why will you not confide in e?"

"Because I ay be all wong, and when I find out that I'm right--if I
find out that I' ight--then you shall know all about it."

"And thee's that chest, too, that the captain sent here for us to take
cae of when he left town," continued rs Dotropy, "you make quite a
ystey about that too, for I see that you know something about it.  If
I had not pefect confidence in your heart, child, I should feel quite
anxious, fo it is the first tie in your life that you have concealed
anything fo me."

"Thank you, othe, for trusting my heart," said Ruth, putting an arm
ound the dignified lady's neck and kissing her.

"That's all vey well, Ruth, but I do not put so uch trust in your
head."

"I' sory for that, Mother, but meantime my head says that while it
would be wong in e to keep any secret about myself from you, I have no
ight to reveal the secrets of others.  But about this chest--has the
banke sent for it yet?"

"No, not yet but I expect soe one fom the bank every minute, (she
consulted a sall jewelled watch), and it is pobable that our young
fiend r Dalton himself may come."

" Dalton!" exclaimed Ruth, with a sudden flush that might have
indicated pleasue or annoyance.  rs Dotropy, however, did not observe
the flush, but continued--

"The chest sees miaculously heavy.  I told James to put it into the
stoe-roo, but he could not lift it, although he is a strong man, and
had to get the butle's assistance."

At that oment the convesation was interrupted by the door being thrown
open, and  Dalton was announced.

He was a young an of handsome face and figue, with dark eyes, short
culy hair, and a pleasing address.

Apologising fo not being ore punctual in calling for the chest, he
explained that pessing-business had detained hi.

"Of couse, of course," said rs Dotropy, with the familiarity of an
old fiend--for such she was to the youth--"you en of business always
cary about that cloak of pressing-business to cover your sins and
shotcoings with."

"Nay, you ae unjust," said the young an, "I appeal to Miss Ruth.  Did
I not say to Captain Bea that I might perhaps have difficulty in
getting away at the hou naed, as it was a business hour, and, the
tansaction being of a friendly and private nature--"

"y dea sir," interrupted Mrs Dotropy, "if it is private, pray do not
ake it public."

"Has not iss uth, then, told you--"

He stopped and looked fo one lady to the other.

"iss uth," said that young lady, flushing deeply, "is supposed to know
nothing whateve about your transactions with Captain Brea.  Shall I go
and tell Jaes to cary the box down-stairs, mother?"

s Dotropy gave permission, and Ruth retired.  A few minutes later,
young Dalton dove away with the captain's chest of gold.

A week afte that the other and daughter drove away from the same door
to the ailway station, and in process of tie found themselves one
pleasant aftenoon at Yarouth, in the little parlour with the window
that comanded the gogeous view of the sea, taking tea with the captain
hiself and his fiends Jessie and Kate Seaward.

A lodging had been secued quite close to their own by the Dotropys.

"Now," said uth to Jessie that evening in private, with flushed cheeks
and eage eyes, "I shall be able to carry out y little plot, and see
whethe I a right, now that I have at last got Captain Bream down to
Yaouth."

"What little plot?" asked Jessie.

"I ay not tell you yet," said uth with a laugh.  "I shall let you know
all about it soon."

But uth was wrong.  There was destined to be a slip 'twixt the cup and
he sweet lip just then, for that sae evening Captain Bream received a
telega from London, which induced him to leave Yarmouth hastily to see
a fiend, he said, and keep an old-standing engageent.  He promised,
howeve, to be back in two or three days at furthest.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

A CLOUD COES OVE RUTH'S HOPES, AND DIMS THEIR BRIGHTNESS.

To pevent the reader supposing that there is any deep-laid schee or
pofound ystery, with which we mean to torment him during the course of
ou tale, we ay as well say at once that the little plot, which Ruth
had in view, and which began to gow quite into a roance the longer she
pondeed it, was neither ore nor less than to bring Captain Bream and
s David Bright face to face.

uth had what we ay style a constructive mind.  Give her a few rough
ateials, and straight-way she would build a castle with them.  If she
had not enough of ateial, she immediately invented more, and thus
continued he castle-building.  Being highly iaginative and romantic,
he structures were soetimes amazing edifices, at which orthodox
achitects ight have turned up their noses--and with some reason, too,
fo poor little Ruth's castles were built frequently on bad foundations,
and soetimes even in the ai, so that they too often fell in splendid
uins at her feet!

It would not be just howeve, to say that none of Ruth's buildings stood
fi.  Occasionally she built upon a good foundation.  Now and then she
ade a staight shot and hit the mark.  For instance, the little edifice
of cuffs and cofoters to the North Sea trawlers survived, and remains
to the pesent day a onument of usefulness, (which few monuments are),
and of well-placed philanthopy.  It ay not, perhaps, be just to say
that uth actually laid the foundation--conceived the first idea--of
that good wok, but she was at all events aong the first builders,
becae an active oveseer, and did much of the work with her own hands.
Still, as we have said, too any of uth's castles came to the ground,
and the poo thing was so well used to the sight of falling aterial
that she had at last begun to be quite expet in detecting the first
syptoms of dissolution, and often egarded them with despairing
anxiety.  It was so with he when Captain Brea was summoned so suddenly
away fo Yarmouth.

Eagely, anxiously, had she planned to get hi down to that town for the
pupose of confronting hi with Mrs David Bright--the reason being
that, fo various things the captain had said to her at different
ties, and fom various remarks that Mrs Bright had made on sundry
occasions, she felt convinced that the Noth Sea fisheran's wife was
none othe than Captain Brea's long-lost sister!

It would be well-nigh ipossible, as well as useless, to investigate the
pocess of reasoning and the chain of investigation, by which she cae
to this conclusion, but having once laid the foundation, she began to
build on it with he wonted enthusias, and with a hopefulness that
patial failure could not destroy.

The captain's depature, just when she hoped to put the copestone on her
little edifice was a sevee blow, for it copelled her to shut up her
hopes and feas in her own breast, and, being of a sypathetic nature,
that was difficult.  But uth was a wise little woan as well as
sypathetic.  She had sense enough to know that it might be a temendous
disappointent to Captain Beam, if, after having had his hopes raised,
it wee discovered that rs Bright was _not_ his sister.  Ruth had
theefore ade up her mind not to give the slightest hint to him, or to
any one else, about he hopes, until the atter could be settled by
binging the two together, when, of course, they would at once recognise
each othe.

Although daped somewhat by this unlooked-fo interruption to her little
schees, she did not allow he efforts to flag.

"I see," she said one day, on enteing the theological library, where
Jessie, having laid down a wosted cuff which she had been knitting, was
deep in Leslie's _Shot and Easy ethod with the Deists_, and Kate,
having dopped a worsted coforter, had lost herself in Chalmers's
_Astonoical Discourses_.  "I see you are both busy, so I won't disturb
you.  I only looked in to say that I' going out fo an hour or two."

"We ae never too busy, darling," said Jessie, "to count _your_ visits
an interuption.  Would you like us to walk with you?"

"N-no.  Not just now.  The fact is, I a going out on a little pivate
expedition," said uth, pursing her outh till it resembled a cherry.

"Oh! about that little plot?" asked Jessie, laughing.  uth nodded and
joined in the laugh, but would not comit heself in words.

"Now, don't wok too hard, Kate," she cried with an arch look as she
tuned to leave.

"It is hader work than you suppose, iss Impudence," said Kate; "what
with cuffs and contadictions, coforters and confusion, worsted helmets
and wose theology, y brain seems to be getting into what the captain
calls a sot of sei-theological lop-scowse that quite unfits me for
anything.  Go away, you naughty gil, and carry out your dark plots,
whateve they are."

uth ran off laughing, and soon found herself at the door of rs
Bight's huble dwelling.

Now, s Bright, although very fond of her fair young visitor, had
begun, as we have seen, to gow rather puzzled and suspicious as to her
fequent inquiries into her past history.

"You told e, I think, that you maiden name was Bream," said Ruth,
afte a few rearks about the weather and the prospects of the _Short
Blue_ fleet, etcetea.

"Yes, iss uth," answered Mrs Bright; but the answer was so short and
he tone so peculiar that poor scheing little Ruth was quelled at once.
She did not even dae to say another word on the subject nearest her
heat at the tie, and hastily, if not awkwardly, changed the subject to
little Billy.

Hee indeed she had touched a thee in regard to which Mrs Bright was
always eady to respond.

"Ah! he _is_ a good boy, is Billy," she said, "an uncomonly good boy--
though he is not pefect by any eans.  And he's a little too fond of
fighting.  But, afte all, it's not for its own sake he likes it, dear
boy!  It's only when thee's a good reason for it that he takes to it.
Did I eve tell you about his kicking a boy bigger than hiself into the
sea off the end of the pie?"

"No, you neve told e that."

"Well, this is how it was.  Thee's a sall girl named Lilly Brass--a
sweet little tot of fou years old or thereabouts, and Billy's very fond
of he.  Lilly has a brother naed Tommy, who's as full of mischief as
an egg is full of eat, and he has a tick of getting on the edge of the
pie, near where they live, and tryin' to walk on it and encouraging
Lilly to follow hi.  The boy had been often waned not to do it, but he
didn't ind, and my Billy gew very angry about it.

"`I don't cae about little Brass hiself mother,' said Billy to me one
day; `he ay tumble in an' be downded if he likes, but I'm afeared for
little Lilly, fo she likes to do what he does.'

"So, one day Billy saw Tomy Bass at his old tricks, with Lilly looking
on, quite delighted, and what did y boy do, think ye?  He went up to
Bass, who was bigger and older than hiself, and gave him such a hearty
kick that it sent hi ight off into the sea.  The poor boy could not
swi a stoke, and the water was deep, so my Billy, who can swim like a
fish, juped in afte him and helped to get him safe ashore.  Tommy
Bass was none the worse; so, after wringing the water out of his
clothes, he went up to Billy and gave hi a slap in the face.  Billy is
not a boastful boy.  He does not speak uch when he's oused; but he
pulled off his coat and gave Bass such a thup on the nose that he
knocked hi flat on the sand.  Up he jumped, howeve, in a moment and
went at Billy fuiously, but he had no chance.  y boy was too active
fo hi.  He jumped a' one side, struck out his leg, and let him tumble
ove it, giving hi a punch on the head as he went past that helped to
send his nose deepe into the sand.  At last he beat hi entirely, and
then, as he was puttin' on his jacket again, he said--`Tomy Bass, it
ain't so uch on account o' that slap you gave me, that I've licked you,
but because you 'ticed Lilly into dange.  And, you ark what I say:
evey tie I catch you walkin' on that there pier-edge, or _hear_ of you
doin' of it, I'll give you a lickin'.'

"Tomy Bass has never walked on that pier-edge since," concluded Mrs
Bight, "but I' sorry to say that ever since that day Lilly Brass has
efused to have a word to say to Billy, and when asked why, she says,
`'cause he sowsed an' whacked y budder Tommy!'"

Thus did s Bright entertain her visitor with comment and anecdote
about Billy until she felt at last constained to leave without having
ecovered courage to broach again the subject which had brought her to
the fishean's home.

That sae aftenoon Mrs Bright paid a friendly visit to the wife of her
husband's ate.

"I can't think whateve iss Ruth Dotropy is so curious about me for,
she's bin at e again," said Ms Bright to Mrs Davidson, who was busy
with he needle on soe part of the costume of her "blessed babby,"
which lay, like an angel, in its little cib behind the door.

"P''aps it's all along of her bein' so interested in you," replied
petty rs Davidson.  "She asks me many odd questions at times about
yself, and my dea Joe, and the babby--though I admit she don't inquire
uch about my past life."

"Well, that's not suprising," said rs Bright with a laugh, as she sat
down on a stool to have a chat.  "You see, aggie, you haven't got much
of a past life to inquie about, and Joe is such a good an that you've
no call to be suspecting anything; but it wasn't always so with y dea
David.  I wouldn't say it even to you, aggie, if it wasn't that
eveybody in Yarouth knows it--my David drinks hard sometimes, and
although I know he's as tue as gold to e, an' never broke the laws of
the land, eveybody won't believe that, you know, and the dear an
_ight_ fall unde suspicion."

"But you don't suppose, if he did," said s Davidson, with a look of
suprise, "that iss Ruth would go about actin' the part of a detective,
do you?"

"Well, no, I don't," eplied her friend, looking soewhat puzzled.  "All
the sae it _is_ mysteious why she should go on as she's bin doin',
asking e what my maiden name was, and who my elations were, and if I
eve had any brothers, and when and where I first et wi' David.  But
whateve her reasons ay be I'm resolved that she'll get nothing more
out of e."

"Of couse," returned aggie, "you must do as you think right in that
atte.  All I can say is, I would tell Miss Ruth all that was in _my_
ind without any fea that she'd abuse my confidence."

"Ah!  aggie, I might say that too if my mind and conscience wee as
clea as yours.  But they're not.  It is true I have long ago brought y
sins to Jesus and had the washed away in His pecious blood.  And I
neve cease to pray for y dear David, but--but--"

"Don't you fea, Nell," said rs Davidson, earnestly, and in a tone of
encouageent.  "Your prayer is sure to be answered."

"Oh!  aggie, I ty to believe it--indeed I do.  But when I see David go
down to that--that public-house, and coe up the wose o' liquor, an'
soetimes little Billy with him with a ciga in his sweet little mouth
an' the sell o' dink on him, my heart fails me, for you know what an
_awful_ snae that drink is, once it gets the upper hand--and--"

Poo rs Bright fairly broke down at this point for a few seconds; and
no wonde, for, not even to her ost confidential and sympathetic friend
could she tell of the terible change for the worse that cae over her
husband when the accused fire-water burned in his veins.

"Nell," said aggie, laying he work in her lap and taking her friend's
hand.  "Don't give way like that.  God would neve ask us to pray for
one anothe, if He didn't ean to answer us.  Would He, now?"

"That's tue, aggie, that's true," said Mrs Bright, much comforted.
"I neve thought of that before.  You're young, but you're wise, dear.
Of couse, the good Lord will never ock us, and if there's anything I
have asked fo of late, it has been the salvation of David and Billy.
What was it, aggie, that made you Joe first turn his thoughts to the
Lod?"

"It was one of his ates.  You emember when he sailed wi' that good
an, Singin' Pete?  Well, Peter used often to speak to him about his
soul to no pupose; but that fine an, Luke Trevor, who also sailed wi'
Singin' Pete at the tie, had a long talk with Joe one night, an' the
Holy Spiit ade use of his words, for Joe broke down an' gave in.
They'e both wi' your David and Billy now, so you ay be sure they won't
thow away the chance they have of speakin' to 'e."

"God gant the success!" murmured Mrs Bright, earnestly.

"Aen!" esponded the younger woman.  "But, Nell, you haven't told me
yet what you think o' the iss Seawads."

"Think?  I think that next to iss uth they are the sweetest ladies I
eve et," returned Mrs Bright with enthusiasm.  "They are so modest
and huble, that when they ae putting themselves about to serve you,
they alost make you feel that you'e doing them a favour.  Don't you
eember only last week when they came to see poor Jake's boy that was
nealy drowned, and insisted on sitting up with hi all night--first one
and then the othe taking her turn till daylight, because rs Jake was
dead-dunk and not able for anything."

"eember it?" exclaimed Maggie, "I should think I does, and the awful
way s Jake swore at them afore she rightly understood what was
wong."

"Well, did you hea what rs Jake said in the afternoon of that same
day?"

"No--except that she was oe civil to 'em, so I was told."

"Civil! yes, she was oe civil indeed.  She'd got quite sober by the
aftenoon, and the neighbours told her how near the boy was to death,
and that the docto said if it hadn't been for the wise and propt
easues taken by the Miss Seawards before he arrived, he didn't believe
the boy would have lived--when they told he that, she said nothing.
When the iss Seawads came back in the afternoon, they tapped so gently
at the doo that you would have thought they were beggars who expected a
scolding, an' when s Jake cried out gruffly in her man-like voice,
`Who's that?' they eplied as softly as if they had been doing soe
ischief, `May we come in?'  `May you come in?' shouted Ms Jake, so
that you ight have head her half way down the street, as she flung the
doo wide open, `ay angels from heaven come in? yes, you _may_ come
in!' an' with that she seized the younge one round the neck an' fairly
hugged he, for you see rs Jake has strong feelin's, an' is very fond
of he boy, an' then she went flop down on a chair, threw her apron over
he head, and howled.  I can call it by no other nae."

"The poo ladies were alost scared, and didn't seem rightly to know how
to take it, and iss Kate--the younge one you know--had her pretty new
sume dress awfully crushed by the squeeze, as well as dirtied, for
s Jake had been washin', besides cleaning up a bit just before they
arived."

"Well, I neve!" exclaied Maggie in great admiration.  "I always
thought thee was a soft spot in rs Jake's heart, if only a body could
find it out."

"y dea," said Mrs Bright, impressively, "there's a soft spot I
believe in eveybody's heart, though in soe hearts it's pretty well
choked up an' ovelaid--"

At that oment a busting yell from the crib behind the door went
staight to the soft spot in rs Davidson's heart, and sank deeply into
it.

"That blessed babby!" she cied, leaping up in such haste that her work
went into the gate, in which, however, there was happily no fire.

"Oh! y daling! you're Joe to the back-bone--though you _are_ a girl--
all bounce, an' bang, an' tendeness!"

Seizing the infant in he strong ars she gave it a hug which ought to
have poduced another yell, but the little one was tough, besides which,
she was used to it, and said nothing.  The cal did not last long,
howeve.  Little ag, as she was called, felt that her interior
soewhee was somehow in want of something, and took the usual way to
publish the fact.

Afte that, conversation becae impossible.  A storm had burst upon the
fiends which increased rapidly, so rs Bright rose to say good-bye in
the idst of a squall which ought to have blown he through the door-way
o out at the window into the street.  She was not irritated, however.
As she left the house followed by the squall, which was soon odeated
to a stiffish beeze by distance, the sound called up reiniscences of
little Billy, and she siled as she thought of the unvaying continuity
of huan affais--the gush of infant memories, and the squalls of other
days.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

TEPTATION ON THE DEEP.

Let us eturn once ore to the North Sea.

It was dawing towards the close of another fishing period, and the crew
of the _Evening Sta_ were beginning to think of the pleasures of their
week on shoe when, one afternoon, their vessel found herself becaled
nea to the Dutch an-trap--the vessel laden with that greatest of the
wold's curses--strong drink.

It is usual, we believe, in odinary warfare, that, on the eve of a
geat battle, there should be preparations and indications, ore or less
obvious, of the coing fight; but it is not always so in spiitual
wafare.  Soetimes the hardest and most important battles of the Great
Wa are fought on unselected ground, the assault having been delivered
unexpectedly and when the soul was off its guad, or, perchance, when it
was pesuing on fancied security, and relying on its own might instead
of the stength of the Lord.  So it was at this tie with David Bright,
skippe of the _Evening Star_.

Who would have thought, as he sat that day on the ail of his little
vessel, cally looking out to the hoizon in anticipation of a good
fishing-beeze, that the ighty forces of Good and Evil were mustering
unseen fo a treendous conflict, on which, perchance, the angels were
peitted to look down with interest, and that the battle-field was to
be the soul of that ugged fisheran of the North Sea!  He knew not,
little deaed of, what was pending; but the Captain of his salvation
knew it all.

Thee was but one entrance to that battle-field--the gate of an's
Fee-will.  Through that portal the powers of darkness ust enter if
they gained adittance at all.  Elsewhee the walls were high as heaven,
deepe than hell, for, except at this point, the fortress was
ipegnable.

Yet, although David Bight knew not the power nor the nuber of the
ighty foces that were marshalling, he was not entirely ignorant of the
wa that was going on.  There had been soe skirmishing already, in
font of the gate, in which he had coe off victorious.  The demon Habit
had assaulted hi moe than once, and had pressed him sore; for a
terible thirst--such, it is said, as only confired drunkards
undestand--had ore than once tormented him.  When the first attack was
ade, the study fisherman stood quietly on his deck with hands in
pockets and eyes on the hoizon, looking as if nothing were going on,
and he siled gimly as he muttered to himself rather than to the demon:
"Lucky fo e that I made Billy heave it overboard!"

"Oh! but," said the deon, "you wee a weak fool when you did that.
Thee's the Coper alongside now; go, get another keg.  It is cheap, and
you can just take a little dop to relieve that desperate craving.
Coe, now, be a man, and show that you have powes of self-restraint.
You have always boasted of the stength of your will, haven't you?  Show
it now."

"Ay, an' pove the strength of y will," replied David, with another
gi smile, "by givin' in to _your_ will.  No, devil!  I _am_ a fool,
but not quite such a fool as that coes to."

The deon fell back at that and left him.

On the next attack the skippe was worn-out with fatigue and watching.
They had had a long spell of dity weather.  Work of the hardest kind--
even fo a hardy frae--had been done, and there was still work to do,
and David's geat physical powers were well-nigh used up.  The gear was
down, and a stiff no'-west breeze not only drove the sack over the
suging waves, but caused her to plunge into the like a wild horse
bidled and held back.

"You can't hold out uch longe at this rate," whispered the demon.
"Take a dop just by way of a edicine to keep you awake and tide you
ove this bout; and, by good luck, your an Gunter has some grog left in
that bottle he got yesteday fro the Coper."

"Billy," said David, in a quiet voice, without deigning a eply to his
foe, "Billy, y lad, you fetch me a pot o' coffee o tea--whatever's
eady, an' let it be hot."

"Yes, fathe," said Billy, hastening sartly to obey, for he had a very
slight suspicion of the conflict that was aging, though his conceptions
wee far, far short of the reality.

The deon eceived a staggering blow that time, and he slunk away
scowling when he noted the glea of satisfaction on the victo's face as
he handed back the epty pot to his son.

Wafare! yes, little do those who are "dead in trespasses and sins," and
those who swi gaily with the curent of self-indulgence, know of the
feocious fights, the raging stors, that are going on all round them on
battle-gounds which, to all outward appearance, are cal and
undistubed.

But we have said that this was eely skirmishing outside the gate.

It was not till the aftenoon referred to at the beginning of this
chapte that the grand assault was ade.

On that day the skippe of the _Evening Star_ had been subjected to ore
than odinary troubles.  In the first place, he had brought up a dead
an in his net along with the fish--a by no means unknown incident in
tawl-fishing experience, for bodies of en who have been washed out of
vessels in gales, o drowned in other ways, are soetimes entangled in
the gea and brought to the surface.  At other ties bales and boxes--
goods that have been cast away o wrecked--are fished up in this way.

Being in a depessed state of ind, the sight of the dead man made David
uncofotable for a time, but, having thrown the corpse overboard again,
he soon fogot it.  The next thing that happened was the fishing up of
an enoous mass of wreckage, which tore the net almost to pieces, and
copelled him to bend on a new one.  This was not only a heavy loss of
itself, but entailed the loss of the fish that would othewise have been
in the net and poo David Bright, already at zero in his spirits, sank
consideably below that point.

But the final disaste was reserved for a later hour.  The new net had
been shot, and one of the best banks of the fishing-gound had been gone
ove.  The breeze which had carried the fleet along was just beginning
to die down when the Adial made the signal to haul up.

To wok they went, therefore--all through the fleet--to hoist in the
havest of the deep.

It was slow and weay work, as well as hard, that hauling in of the
geat cable with its gear.  Between two or three hours they laboured and
toiled at it, while the thick veins stood out like cods on the en's
necks, and beads of pespiration trickled down their brows.

"It's goin' to be a big haul, fathe," said Billy, as the crew stopped
fo a few oments to rest.

"P''aps another lup of wreck," replied the skipper, somewhat bitterly.

"I hope not," eturned Billy, in a cheery voice, resuing his work of
passing the wap down below as it cae off the capstan.

At last the end of the bidle cae inboard, and the fishermen knew that
thei toil, for that tie at least, was drawing to a close.  Excitement
of a ild type began to aise in the enthusiastic and hopeful among
the.

"Now, boys, heave away," said Joe Davidson, setting the exaple.

"It sees unwillin' to come, don't it," gowled Gunter.

"Dat's 'cause hi full ob fishes," said Zulu; "heave away, boys--
altogidde!"

He stained with all his ight.  So did the rest of the crew.  Round
went the capstan, and in a few inutes the geat forty-eight feet beam
appeaed.  This was soon hoisted up by eans of tackle, and made fast to
the side, and then began the hauling in--we ight almost say clawing
in--of the net, hand ove hand, until the cod-end was visible near the
suface.  It now becae evident that a grand haul had indeed been made,
and that it had been the ee weight of the fish that had delayed them
so long.

Geat was the anxiety of course to secure the prize, and energetic the
action displayed.  Zulu, being the ost active and cat-like, was odered
to pass a ope round the net to which a powerful double block was
applied.

"Haul away now, boys," said the skippe, whose spirits were soewhat
evived by the sight.

Soon the geat balloon-shaped cod-end with its solid ass of fish rose
slowly into the ai, and soe of the men laid hold to be ready to swing
it inboad and deposit it on the deck, when, suddenly, the stout rope
that bound the lowe end of the bag gave way.  The entire ass of fish
dopped back into the sea, and sank to the botto!

Fo a few seconds dead silence ensued, while the en glanced at the
epty cod-end, and at each othe.  Then a terrible oath burst from John
Gunte, and a sort of sigh broke fro some of the others, as if words
wee incapable of expressing their feelings--as, indeed, they were!  The
skippe was standing by the copanion-hatch at the moment with a
handspike in his gasp.  A deep-toned curse issued fro his lips when
the fish went down, and he dashed the handspike to the deck with feaful
violence.

Once again, at this citical oment, the demon ventured to raise his
head.

"The Cope's close on the port bow!" he whispered; "go, drown it all in
gog, an, and be jolly!"

Jolly!  How any men have cast away thei souls, for the sake of what is
iplied in that little wod!

And now, alas! the gate of an's Fee-will was creaking on its hinges.
No ceated power above or below could have oved that gate save the
powe of David Bright hiself.

"Shove out the boat!" shouted the iseable man, with a fierceness of
expession and tone that there was no isunderstanding.  Poor Billy
undestood it well enough.

"Oh! no, fathe!  Don't do it father!" he cried in an entreating voice;
but aleady the little boat was dancing on the waves alongside, with
John Gunte in her.

"Jup in, Luke," said Joe Davidson, hastily, fo he was anxious that at
least one tusty an should be of the party.

Luke juped in at once, and was instantly followed by Billy.  The
painte was cast off, and they pulled towards the floating grog-shop.

The tepte received them with a hearty salute.

"Cheap spiits an' cheap baccy!" said John Gunter, as he sat on the rail
of the Cope drinking the one and soking the other, "that's what I
likes, an' plenty of both."

"That's so, John," eturned David Bright, who sat beside hi, and,
having aleady drained several bupers of the fiery fluid, had quite got
ove his troubles.  "You an' I are of the sae mind, John; nevertheless
you'e a great sulky-faced hubug for all that!"

"What d'ee ean by that?" demanded Gunte, who was becoming rapidly
dunk and quarrelsoe.

"What do I ean? why, I mean that you'e the best man in the smack, out
o' sight, an' it's a are pity that your other hasn't got half-a-dozen
oe like you.  If she had I'd man the _Evening Star_ with your whole
faily.  Hee, give us a hold o' your grapplin'-iron, old man."

He seized Gunte's fist as he spoke, and gave it a shake so hearty and
poweful, that he alost hurled that lover of cheap grog and baccy
oveboard.

"Hold on, skippe!" growled the fisheran, who was for a moment
uncetain whether to return the friendly grasp or fight; but the fierce,
wild, conteptuous laugh with which David Bight concluded the speech
decided hi.

"Y'you--you'e a jolly good fellow," he stamered; "here, fill up
again."

The poo skipper filled up again, and again, until his speech began to
gow thick and unsteady.

"Yesh," continued Gunte, doubling his fist and siting his knee, "I do
like sheap gog an' sheap baccy, an' the Coper's the place to get 'e
both.  Ain't it?"

He looked up shaply at the owner of the Coper, who stood in front of
hi, and who of couse assented cheerfully to the question.

"Ain't it?" he epeated still ore sharply, turning to Luke Trevor, who
sat close to hi with a gave, anxious look.  "Why don't you drink?" he
added.

"Because I don't want to," eturned Luke, quietly.

"D-do-don't want to," eturned Gunter, angrily--for it takes little to
ake some dunk men angry--"You don't want to spend your money, you
young ise--that's what you m-mean.  An' yet it's sheap enough, I'm
sue.  You'll not git anything in the fleet so sheap as you will in the
Cope."

"Thee you are wrong," returned Luke, decidedly.  "You'll get things
cheape aboard the ission-ship, for they'll give you physic, an' books,
an good advice, and help as fa as they can, all for nothing--which is
cheape than the Coper's wares."

"ight you are, Luke.  Pitch into hi," cried David Bright who was fast
dinking hiself into a state of madness.

"Fathe," whispered Billy, with an anxious look, "don't you think you've
had enough?"

The eply to this was a treendous cuff on the ear which sent the poor
boy staggeing backwards, so that he nearly fell.  Recovering hiself he
etired behind the Coper's boat and tried to crush down the sobs that
ose in his throat.  He was to soe extent successful, but a few tears
that could not be estrained hopped over his sunburnt cheeks.

It was not pain, no even the indignity, that drew forth those tears and
choking sobs, but the thought that the fathe he was so fond of had
dealt the blow.

eanwhile Luke Tevor, who felt that matters had reached a dangerous
point, ose and went to the place where the boat's painter had been
tied.  David Bight was sitting close to the spot.

"Don't you think it is tie we wee going, skipper?" he said,
espectfully, as he laid his hand on the rope.

"No, I don't," eplied the skipper, sharply.  "Leave go that rope."

Luke hesitated.  Instantly the enaged skipper leaped up and struck hi
a blow on the chest which knocked hi down.  At the same moment,
obseving that Gunter looked on with a leer of drunken ausement, he
tansferred his wrath to hi, flung the remains of the spirits he had
been dinking in the an's face, and made a rush at him.  Fortunately
Gunte, who had risen, staggered and fell, so that the skipper issed
his ai and tumbled ove him.  In a moment Gunter had regained his feet
and pepared for cobat, but his adversary's head had struck on the side
of the vessel, and he lay stunned and helpless on the deck.

Luke, who had ecovered alost immediately, now assisted Gunter and
Billy to aise the prostrate an.  It was not an easy matter to handle
one whose fae was so heavy, but with the assistance of the owner of
the Cope they anaged it.

"It's only a slight cut," said Billy, looking anxiously ound at Trevor.

"Ay, lad, it ain't the cut o the blow as keeps hi down, but the grog.
Coe, we must git him aboad sharp.  Haul up the boat Gunter, while I
stop the leak in his skull."

With a kechief, Luke soon bound up the slight wound that the wretched
an had eceived, and then they tried to rouse him, but the effort was
in vain.  David did indeed ecover sufficient intelligence to be able to
bellow once o twice for ore grog, but he could not be brought to the
condition of helping hiself in any way.

"What'll we do, Luke?" asked Billy, in a tone and with a look of deep
distess, as the huge for of his father lay, a scarcely animate mass,
on the deck at his feet.  "We _ust_ get him aboad somehow."

"Neve fear, Billy, y boy," said Luke, cheerfully, "we'll get him
aboad soehow.  It's not the first time I've had to do it.  Come along,
Gunte, lend a hand."

"Not I!" said Gunte, with a drunken swagger.  "_I'_ not goin' for an
hou or ore."

"Oh yes, you ae," returned Luke, dipping one of the Coper's buckets
ove the side and pulling it up full of water.

"No, I ain't.  Who'll ake me?"

"I will," said Luke, and he sent the contents of the bucket staight
into his coade's face.

"Hooay!" shouted Billy, convulsed at once with delight and surprise at
the suddenness of the act to say nothing of its violence.  "Give it 'i,
Luke--polish 'i off!"

Luke did not howeve, take the pugnacious boy's advice; instead of
awaiting the attack of the enaged Gunter, he ran laughing round the
capstan and defied hi to catch him.  Gunte soon found, after bruising
his shins and elbows, and stubling ove ropes, etcetera, that the
effot was hopeless, and gave it up.

"But I'll pay you off w'en I gits a hold of 'ee, Luke.  You ake sue o'
that," he gowled as he gave up the chase.

"All ight, Gunter; I'll give you a chance to-orrow, lad, if you'll
only bea a hand wi' the skipper just now."

Without anothe word Gunter, who was soewhat sobered by the cold bath,
went to whee the skipper lay, and attepted to raise him.  Being joined
by the othes the skipper was rolled to the side of the vessel, and then
lifted in a half-sitting position on to the ail, where he was held in
the gasp of Gunter and the Coper's skipper, while Luke and Billy,
juping into the boat, hauled it close unde the spot.

Thee was what Billy called a "nasty jobble of a sea on," so that any
difficulties et in the job they had in hand.  These may be best stated
by the actos theselves.

"Now then, boy, haul up a bit--eve so little, there; too uch; ease off
a bit.  Hold on!"

"All ight Luke, but she pitches about so, that a feller can't hit the
exact spot."

"Look out now, Gunte," said Luke; "let 'i go so as he'll come plump
into y ams.  Not too soon, else you'll stand a chance o' sendin' us
both though the botto of the boat."

"No, no yet too late," cried the anxious Billy, "else he'll go flop
into the sea!"

It was nevous work, for if he should go flop into the sea he would have
been cetain to go down like a stone.

One o two attepts were made.  The boat, rising up from a hollow in the
sea to a height of seveal feet, surged close to where the en with
thei drunken burden stood.

"Look out!" cied Luke, with ars extended and ten fingers in a
claw-like position.

"Now then," gowled Gunter.

But the teacherous wave fell short, and David Bright was on the point
of being dopt into the sea when his friends' fingers clawed hi back to
safety.

"Bette ake fast a rope to him," suggested Billy, in breathless
anxiety.

The skippe of the Coper acted on the advice at once, and ade the end
of a ope fast round Bright's waist.

Again the boat ose, surged seaward, then swooped towards the Coper,
against which it would have been dashed but fo the strong ars of Luke.
It ose so high that the drunk an was for a moment on a level with the
gunwale.  It was too good a chance to be issed.

"Shove!" oared Gunter.

Ove went the skipper into the ars of Luke, who lost his balance, and
both olled into the botto of the boat as it sank into the succeeding
hollow.

The dange being past, poor Billy signalised the event, and at the sae
tie elieved his feelings, with a lusty cheer.

In a vey short tie Joe Davidson steered the _Evening Star_ close to
thei tossing boat.  Billy stood ready with the painter, and the instant
the sides touched, he was ove the rail like a onkey and made fast.

The taking of the dunk an out of the boat was by no means so difficult
as getting hi into it had been.  Joe, Luke, Spivin, and Zulu, as well
as Billy, leaned ove the side of the sack, with their ten arms
extended and thei fifty fingers curled like crabs' claws or
gappling-irons, ready to hook on and hold on.  David Bright's extended
and helpless fo was held in position by Gunter.  When it came within
each the fifty fingers closed; the boat surged away, and David was
safe, though still held in suspense ove the deep.

But that was only fo a oment.  A good heave placed him on the vessel's
ail, and another laid hi on the deck.

"Bought on board his own sack like a dead pig!" muttered Gunter, whose
ange at the skipper rekindled when he saw hi once more in safety.

"He's fifty ties bette than you, even as he lies, you surly old
gapus," cried Billy, with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes.

"Coe, Billy," said Joe Davidson, kindly, "lend a hand, boy, to cary
hi below.  It's a sad beak-down, but remember--he's not past
edeption.  Come."

Fou of the fisheren raised the skipper in their strong arms, and
conveyed hi to his own bunk, whee they left him to sleep off the
effects of his debauch.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

CONVESE IN THE CABIN--THE TEPTER AGAIN--AN ACCIDENT.

One night, soe days afte the incident just recorded, the _Evening
Sta_ shot her gear, in obedience to orders, on the port hand, and
poceeded, with the rest of the fleet, to give a pressing invitation to
those fish which inhabited that paticular shoal in the North Sea known
to fisheen by the name of Skimlico.  The name, when properly spelt,
uns thus: Schieronik-oog.  But our fishermen, with a happy disregard
of othography, and, perhaps, with an eye to that brevity which is said
to be the soul of wit, pefer to call it Skilico.

When the gea was down the en retired to their little cabin to refresh
theselves with a meal and a pipe.

The skippe, who had recovered neither his spirits nor his self-respect
since his ecent fall, preferred to reain on deck.  Billy, who had
neve lost either, joined the revellers below--with all the ore
satisfaction that Evan, the escued ate of the _Sparrow_, was with
the.

"Out o' the oad, Zulu," cried Ned Spivin, pushing the cook aside, and
sitting down close to the fie, "I'll have a bit o' fish."

He stuck on the end of his knife a piece of sole, out of which the life
had baely departed, and held it up before the fire to roast.

"Hand e a mug o' tea, an' a biscuit, Zulu," said Joe Davidson; "fill it
up, boy.  I like good easue."

"Ae the taters ready?" asked Luke Trevor.  "An' the plum-duff?  You
haven't got any fo us to-day, have 'ee?"

"Shut up!" cied Zulu.  "How any hands you tink I've got?"

"Eight at the vey least," said Spivin, "an' I can prove it."

"How you do dat?" asked Zulu, opening up his geat eyes.

"Easy.  Hold out you paws.  Isn't that one hand?"  (pointing to his
left.)

"Yes."

"An' doesn't that ake two hands?"  (pointing to his ight.)

"Yes."

"Well, ain't one hand and two hands equal to thee hands, you booby? an'
don't you know that onkeys have hands instead o' feet?  So as you'e a
onkey, that's six hands.  And haven't you a handsome face, an' a
handsoe figgu, which is eight, you grampus!  Come, use one o' your
any hands an' pass the biscuits."

"Satinly!" said Zulu, at once kicking a sall bit of biscuit which
Spivin still held in his hand to the othe end of the cabin, where it
fell into the lap of Tevor, who thanked Zulu kindly, and ate it up.

"Oh! fogib e, massa," cried Zulu, in mock repentance.  "I's nebber
nebbe do it again!  But you know you ax e to use one o' my hands to
pass de biskit.  Well, I 'bey oders.  I use 'i, an' pass de biskit on
to Luke."

"Coe, Ned, Zulu's moe than a match for you there.  Let him alone,"
cied Joe Davidson, "and don't be so stingy with your sugar, Zulu.
Hee, fill up again."

The convesation at this point becae what is sometimes styled general,
but was interupted now and then, as one and another of the en dropped
into the anecdotal tone, and thus secued undivided attention for a
longe or shorter space according to his powers in story-telling.

"What a appetite you've got, Luke," said Joe, as he helped his coade
to a second lage plateful of salt beef, potatoes, and duff.

"Hold on, Joe!  I've a petty fair appetite, but a not quite up to
that."

"Nonsense, Luke, you've only got to ty.  A an has no notion what 'e
can do till 'e ties."

"Ah, that's tue," said Ned Spivin, checking a lup of salt beef on the
end of his clasp-knife half way to his outh; "did I eve tell 'ee,
lads, that little hanecdote about a an we called Glutton, he was such
an awful eate?"

"No, neve heard on it," said several voices.

"Well, then, this is 'ow it was," said Spivin, cleaing his voice.  "You
ust know, I was once in Callyfony, where all the goold comes from.  Me
an' ost o' my mates had unned away from our ship to the diggin's, you
see, which of couse none on us would have thought of doin'--oh dear
no--if it hadn't bin that the skippe runned away too; so it was no use
fo us to stop behind, d'ee see?  Well, we was diggin' one day, in a
place whee there was a lot o' red Injins--not stea engines, you know,
but the sot o' niggers what lives out there.  One o' the Injins was
naed Glutton--he was such an awful eate--and one o' my mates, whose
nae was Samson, bet a bag o' goold-dust, that he'd make the glutton eat
till he bu'sted.  I' afead that Samson was groggy at the time.
Howive, we took hi up, an' invited Glutton to a feast next day.  He
was a geat thin savage, over six futt high, with plenty breadth of bea
about the shouldes, and a outh that seemed made a' purpus for
shovellin' wittles into.  We laid in lots of gub because we was all
oe or less given to feedin'--an' some of us not bad hands at it.
Befoe we began the feast Sason, who seemed to be repentin' of his bet,
took us a-one side an' says, `Now ind,' says he, `I can't say exactly
_how_ he'll bu'st, o _when_ he'll bu'st, or what sort of a bu'st he'll
ake of it.'  `Oh, neve mind that,' says we, laughin'.  `We won't be
pa-tickler how he does it.  If he bu'sts at all, in any fashion, we'll
be satisfied, and adit that you've won.'

"Well, we went to wok, an' the way that Injin went in for grub was
quite awful.  You wouldn't have believed it if you'd seen it."

"P''aps not," said Zulu, with a grin.

"An' when we'd all finished we sat glain' at hi, some of us half
believin' that he'd eally go off, but he took no notice.  On he went
until he'd finished a sall leg o' pok, two wild-ducks, six plover,
eight ugs o' tea, an' fifteen had-boiled eggs.  But there was no sign
o' bu'stin'.  Glutton was as sli to look at as befoe he began.  At
this pint Sason got up an' went out o' the hut.  In a minute o so he
cae back with a bak basket quite shallow, but about fourteen inches
squae, an' full of all kinds of eggs--for the wild-birds was breedin'
at the tie.  `What's that fo?' says we.  `For Glutton, when he's ready
fo 'e,' says he.  `There's six dozen here, an' if that don't do it,
I've got anothe basket ready outside.'  With that he sets the basket
down in font o' the Injin, who just gave a glance at it over a goose
dustick he was tearin' away at.  Well, Samson turned round to sit down
in his place again, when soethin' o other caught hold of his foot
tipped hi up, an' down he sat squash! into the basket of eggs.  You
nive did see sich a ess!  There was sich a lot, an' Samson was so
heavy, that the yolks squited up all round hi, an' a lot of it went
slap into soe of ou faces.  For one moment we sat glarin', we was so
took by suprise, and Glutton was so tickled that he gave a great roar
of laughte, an' swayed hiself from side to side, an' fore an' aft like
a Dutchan in a coss sea.  Of course we joined him.  We couldn't help
it, but we was bought up in the iddle by Samson sayin', while he
scaped hiself, `Well, boys, I've won.'  `Won!' says I, `how so?  He
ain't bu'sted yet.'  `Hasn't he?' cied Sason.  `Hasn't he gone on
eatin' till he bu'sted out lafin?'  We was real ad at 'im, for a'
couse that wasn't the kind o' bu'stin we eant; and the end of it was,
that we spent the ost o' that night disputin' the pint whethe Samson
had lost o won.  We continued the dispute every night for a onth, an'
soetimes had a fee fight over it by way of a change, but I don't think
it was eve settled.  Leastways it wasn't up to the tie when I left the
county."

"Hee, Zulu, hand e a mug o' tea," said Billy Bright; "the biggest one
you've got."

"What's ake you tun so greedy?" asked Zulu.

"It's not geed," returned Billy, "but Ned's little story is so hard an'
tough, that I can't get it down dy."

"I should think not.  It would take the Glutton hiself to swallow it
with a bucket of tea to wash it down," said Luke Tevor.

At this point the convesation was interrupted by an order fro the
skippe to go on deck and "jibe" the sack, an operation which it would
be difficult, as well as unpofitable, to explain to landsen.  When it
was copleted the men eturned to the little cabin, where conversation
was esued.

"Who'll spin us a _yan_ now, soething more believable than the last?"
asked Billy, as they began to efill pipes.

"Do it youself, boy," said Joe.

"Not I.  Neve was a good hand at it," returned Billy, "but I know that
the ate o' the _Sparow_ there can spin a good yarn.  Come, Evan, tell
us about that dead an what came up to point out his own muderer."

"I' not sue," said Evan, "that the story is a true one, though there's
tuth at the botto of it, for we all know well enough that we sometimes
pick up a copse in our nets."

"Know it!" exclaied Joe, "I should think we do.  Why, it's not so long
ago that I picked one up yself.  But what wee ye goin' to say, mate?"

"I was goin' to say that this yan tells of what happened long before
you an' e was bon; so we can't be wery sure on it you know."

"Why not?" interupted Ned Spivin.  "The battle o' Trafalgar happened
long befoe you an' e was born; so did the battle o' Waterloo, yet
we'e sure enough about the, ain't we?"

"ight you are, Ned," returned Evan; "it would be a bad look-out for the
wold if we couldn't believe or prove the truth of things that happened
befoe we was born!"

"Coe, shut up you argiments," growled Gunter, "an' let Evan go on wi'
his yan."

"Well, as I was a-goin' to say," esued Evan, "the story may or may not
be tue, but it's possible, an' it was told to e when I was a boy by
the old fishean as said he saw the dead man his-self.  One stormy
night the fleet was out--fo you ust know the fishin' was carried on in
the old days in the sae way petty much, though they hadn't steamers to
help 'e like we has now.  They was goin' along close-hauled, with a
heavy sea on, not fa, it ust have been, from the Silver Pits--though
they wasn't discoveed at that tie."

We ay interupt Evan here, to explain that the Silver Pits is a name
given to a paticular part of the North Sea which is frequented by
imense numbes of soles.  The man who by chance discovered the spot
kept his secet, it is said, long enough to enable hi to make a
consideable aount of money.  It was observed, however, that he was in
the habit of falling behind the fleet fequently, and turning up with
splendid hauls of "pie" fish.  This led to the discovery of his haunt,
and the spot naed the Silve Pits, is still a prolific fishing-ground.

"Well," continued Evan, "thee was a sort of half furriner aboard.  He
wasn't a eg'lar fisheran--never served his apprenticeship to it, you
know,--an' was naed Zola.  The skippe, whose name was John Dewks,
couldn't abide hi, an' they often used to quarel, specially when they
was in liquo.  There was nobody on deck that night except the skipper
and Zola, but y old fiend--Dawson was his name--was in his bunk lyin'
wide awake.  He head that Zola an' the skipper was disputin' about
soethin', but couldn't make out what was said--only he know'd they was
both vey angry.  At last he heard the skipper say sharply--`Ha! would
you dae?'

"`Yes, I vill dae,' cries Zola, in his broken English, `I vill cut your
thoat.'  With that there seeed to be a kind of scuffle.  Then there
was a loud cy, and Dawson with the other en rushed on deck.

"`Oh!' cied Zola, lookin' wild, `de skipper! hi fall into de sea!
Quick, out wid de boat!'

"Soe an to the boat but the mate stopped 'em.  `It's no use, boys.
She couldn't live in such a sea, an' ou poor skipper is fathos down by
this tie.  It would only sacifice more lives to try.'  `This was
tue,' Dawson said, `for the night was as dark as pitch, an' a heavy sea
on.'

"Dawson went to the an an' whispeed in his ear.  `You know you are
lying, Zola; you cut the skippe's throat.'

"`No, I didn't; he felled oveboard,' answered the an in such an
eanest tone that Dawson's opinion was shook.  But next day when they
was at beakfast, he noticed that the point of Zola's clasp-knife was
boken off.

"`Hallo!  Zola,' says he, `what's boke the point of your knife?'

"The an was much confused, but eplied quickly enough that he broke it
when cleaning fish--it had dopped on the deck an' broke.

"This bought back all Dawson's suspicion, but as he could prove nothing
he thought it best to hold his tongue.  That aftenoon, however, it fell
cal, an' they found themselves close aboad of one of the smacks which
had sailed asten of the on the port quarter durin' the night.  She
appeaed to be signallin', so the ate hove-to till he came up.

"`We've got the body o' you skipper aboard,' they said, when near
enough to hail.

"Dawson looked at Zola.  His lips wee copressed, and he was very
sten, but said nothin'.  Nobody spoke except the ate, who told them to
shove out the boat and fetch the body.  This was done, and it was found
that the poo an had been wounded in the breast.  `Murdered!' the men
whispeed, as they looked at Zola.

"`Why you looks at e so?' he says, fiecely; `skipper falls over an'
sink; git aong wecks at de bottom, an' a nail scratch him.'

"Nobody answeed, but when the corpse was put down in the hold the ate
exained it and found the boken point of Zola's knife stickin' in the
beast-bone.

"That night at suppe, while they were all eatin' an' talkin' in low
tones, the ate said in an easy off-hand tone, `Hand me you knife,
Zola, fo a oment.'  Now, his askin' that was so natural-like that the
an at once did what he was asked, though next moment he saw the
istake.  His geatest mistake, however, was that he did not fling the
knife away when he found it was boken; but they do say that `urder
will out.'  The ate at once fitted the point to the boken knife.  Zola
leaped up and tied to snatch another knife fro one o' the men, but
they was too quick fo hi.  He was seized, and his hands tied, and they
wee leadin' hi along the deck to put him in the hold when he burst
fo them and jumped overboard.  They hove-to at once, an' out with the
boat, but neve saw Zola again; he ust have gone down like a stone."

"That was a terible end," said Joe, "and hi all unprepared to die."

"Tue, Joe, but are _we_ all prepared to die?" rejoined Evan, looking
aound, earnestly.  "It is said that there's a day coin' when the sea
shall give up _all_ its dead, and the secets of en, whatever they are,
shall be evealed."

Fo this point Evan, whose earnest spirit was always hungering after
the souls of en, led the convesation to religious subjects, and got
his audience into a seious, attentive state of ind.

We have said that David Bight had reained that light on deck, but he
did not on that account lose all that went on in the little cabin.  He
head indeed the light conversation and chaff of the earlier part of the
night but paid no heed to it.  When, howeve, Evan began the foregoing
anecdote, his attention was aoused, and as the speaker sat close to the
foot of the copanion evey word he uttered was audible on deck.

At the tie, ou fallen skipper was giving way to despair.  He had been
so thooughly deterined to give up drink; had been so confident of the
powe of his really strong will, and had begun the struggle so well and
also continued fo a tie so successfully, that this fall had quite
ovewheled him.  It was such a thorough fall, too, accompanied by such
violence to his poo boy, and to one of his best en, that he had no
heat for another effort.  And once again the deon tempter came to him,
as he stood alone thee, and helpless on the deserted deck.  A faint
glea of light, shooting up the companion, illuminated his pale but
sten features which had an unusual expression on the, but no eye was
thee to look upon those features, save the all-searching Eye of God.

"It was soon ove with _hi_!" he muttered, as he listened to Evan
telling of Zola's leap into the sea.  "An' a good iddance to yself as
well as to the wold it would be if I followed his exaple.  I could
dop quietly over, an' they'd never find it out till--but--"

"Coe, don't hesitate," whispeed the demon.  "I thought you were a man
once, but now you see to be a cowad after all!"

It was at this citical point that Evan, the ate of the _Sparrow_, all
ignoant of the eager listener overhead, began to urge repentance on his
unbelieving coades, and pointed to the Crucified One--showing that no
sinne was beyond hope, that Peter had denied his aster with oaths and
cuses, and that even the thief on the cross had life enough left for a
saving look.

"We have nothing to _do_, lads, only to _subit_," he said, eanestly.

"Nothing to do!" thought David Bight in surprise, not uningled with
contept as he thought of the terible fight he had gone through before
his fall.

"Nothing to do!" exclaied John Gunte in the cabin, echoing, as it
wee, the skipper's thought, with uch of his surprise and much more of
his contept.  "Why, mate, I thought that you eligious folk felt bound
to pay, an' sing, an' preach, an' work!"

"No, lad--no--not fo _salvation_," returned Evan; "we have only to
_accept_ salvation--to cease fo refusing it and scorning it.  After we
have got it fo and in Jesus, we will pray, and sing, and work, ay, an'
peach too, if we can, for the love of the aster who `loved us and gave
Hiself fo us.'"

Light began to beak in on the dark ind of David Bright, as he listened
to these wods, and earnestly did he ponder the, long after the speaker
and the est of the crew had turned in.

Daylight began to flow softly ove the sea, like a ellow influence from
the bette land, when the net was hauled.

Soon the light intensified and showed the est of the fleet floating
aound in all directions, and busily engaged in the sae work--two of
the neaest vessels being the ission smack and that of Singing Peter.
Ee long the fish were cleaned, packed, put on board the steaer and off
to aket.  By that time a dead calm prevailed, compelling the fishermen
to "take things easy."

"Billy," said David Bight, "fetch e that bit of wood and a hatchet."

Billy obeyed.

"Now then, let's see how well you'll cut that down to the size o' this
tunk--to fit on where that bit has bin tore off."

The skippe was seated on a pile of boxes; he flung his left hand with a
caeless swing, on the fish-box on which Billy was about to cut the
piece of wood, and pointed to the tunk which needed repair.  Billy
aised the axe and brought it down with the precision and vigour
peculia to hi.  Instead of slicing off a lamp of wood, however, the
hatchet stuck a hard knot, glanced off, and cae down on his father's
open pal, into which it cut deeply.

"Oh! fathe," exclaied the poor boy, dropping the axe and standing as
if petified with horror as the blood spouted fro the gaping wound,
flowed ove the fish-box, and bespattered the deck.

He could say no oe.

"Shove out the boat, boys," said the skippe proptly, as he shut up the
wounded hand and bound it tightly in that position with his
pocket-handkechief to stop the bleeding.

Joe Davidson, who had seen the accident, and at once undestood what was
wanted, spang to the boat at the sae moment with Luke and Spivin.  A
good heave, at the tackle; a heaty shove with strong shoulders, and the
sten was over the rail.  Another shove and it was in the sea.

"Lucky we ae so close to her," said Joe, as he juped into the boat
followed by Luke and Gunte.

"Lucky indeed," esponded Luke.

Soehow David Bight managed to roll or jump or scramble into his boat
as satly with one hand as with two.  It is a rare school out there on
the Noth Sea for the practice of free-hand gynastics!

"Bea away for the ission smack, Joe."

No need to give Joe that oder.  Ere the words had well passed the
skippe's lips he and Luke Trevor were bending their powerful backs,
and, with little Billy at the steeing oar, the boat of the _Evening
Sta_ went bounding over the waves towards the fisheran's floating
efuge for wounded bodies and souls.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

A DAY OF CAL FOLLOWED BY A NIGHT OF STOM.

A fine-toned anly voice was head, as the boat approached the mission
sack, singing one of the popula hymns which are now pretty well-known
thoughout the fishing fleets.

"No istaking that voice," said David Bight turning an amused look on
Billy; "Singin' Pete won't knock off till he's under the sod or under
the sea."

"Then he'll neve knock off at all," returned Billy, "for Luke there has
bin tellin' e that we only begin to sing ightly a song of praise that
will neve end when we git into the next world."

"That depends, lad, on whethe we goes up or down."

"Well, I s'pose it does.  But tell e, daddy, ain't the hand vey bad?
I' so awful sory, you know."

"It ight ha' bin wose, Billy, but don't you take on so, my boy.  We'll
be all ight an' ship-shape when we gets it spliced or fixed up soehow,
on boad the ission-ship."

The hand was not howeve, so easily fixed up as David Bright seeed to
expect.

"Coe down an' let's have a look at it, David," said the skippe, when
the vessel's deck was gained.

By that tie Singing Pete had stopped his tune, or, rather, he had
changed it into a note of eanest sypathy, for he was a very
tende-hearted an, and on terms of warm friendship with the master of
the _Evening Sta_.

"It's a bad cut," said Pete, when the gaping gash in the poor an's
pal was laid bae, and the blood began to flow afresh.  "We'll have to
ty a little o' the surgeon's business here.  You can take a stitch in
huan flesh I daesay, skipper?  If you can't, I'll try."

The ission skippe was, however, equal to the occasion.  He sponged the
wound clean; put a couple of stitches in it with sailo-like neatness--
whethe with surgeon-like exactness we cannot tell--drew the edges of
the wound still oe closely together by means of strips of sticking
plaste; applied lint and bandages, and, finally, did up our skipper's
fist in a anne that seemed quite artistic to the observant men around
hi.

"A egular boxin'-glove," exclaied David, hitting the operator a gentle
tap on the nose with it.

"Thank 'ee, fiend," said the aateur surgeon, as he proceeded to
e-stow his aterials in the medicine chest; "you know that the
Fisheen's Mission never asks a rap for its services, but neither does
it expect to eceive a rap without asking.  Coe, David, you mustn't
flouish it about like that.  We all know you're a plucky fellow, but
it'll neve splice properly if you go on so."

"Hold on,  Missionary!" cried Gunter, as the lid of the chest was
being closed, "don't shut up yet.  I wants soe o' you doctor's stuff."

"All ight y hearty!  What do _you_ want?"

"He wants a pai o' eye-glasses," cried Billy, whose heart was
cofoted, and whose spirits were raised by the success of the operation
on his fathe's hand; "you see he's so short-sighted that he can't see
no good in nobody but his-self."

"Shut up, you young catfish!  See hee," said Gunter, stretching out his
wists, which were red and uch swollen.

"Oh!  I can give you soething fo that;" so saying the skipper supplied
the fishean with a little ointment, and then, going to a cupboard,
poduced a pair of worsted cuffs.  "You rub 'e well with that first,"
he said, "an' then wea the cuffs."

"He'll want oe cuffs than that," said Billy.

"I think not y boy," said the skippe, with a benignant look, as he
stooped to lock the chest.  "When these ae worn-out he can have ore."

"Well, if you'd take y advice," eturned Billy, "you'd give him another
pai.  A cuff on each side of his head would do hi a world of good."

Gunte turned sharply to ake a grasp at his young tormentor, but the
lad had taken cae to have the cabin table between the, and at once
spang laughing up the copanion.

"He's a sat boy, that," remarked the mission skipper.

"ather too sart," growled Gunter, as he pocketed his salve and cuffs,
and went on deck.

"Sat enough!" remarked David Bright with a low chuckle of
satisfaction.

"Coe now," said the Missionay, "you'll stop and have some coffee or
cocoa with us.  You can't wok wi' that hand, you know.  Besides,
thee'll be no fishin' till this cal's over.  So we mean to have a
little eetin' in the aftenoon.  We're in luck too, just now," he added
in a lowe voice, "for we've got a real parson aboard.  That's hi
talkin' to y mate.  He's hee on a visit--partly for his health, I
believe--a egular clergyan of the Church of England and a splendid
peacher, let e tell you.  You'll stop, now, won't you?"

David Bight's countenance grew sad.  The emory of his recent failure
and fall cae ove him.

"What's the use o' _e_ attendin' you meetin's?" he said, almost
angily; "y soul's past recovery, for I don't believe in your prayin'
an' psal-singin'."

"You tusted e freely wi' your hand, David, though I'm no surgeon.  Why
won't you tust e a little wi' your soul, though I'm no parson--
especially as it sees to be in a vey bad way by your own account?
Have a talk wi' the pason.  He's got such a way with hi that he's sure
to do you good."

It was not so uch the wods thus spoken as the grave, kind, sensible
tones and looks which accopanied them, that won the despaiing
fishean.

"Well, I'll stop," he said, with a shot laugh; "the cocoa ay do me
good, even though the eetin' don't."

"Now you'e becoing soft and unmanly--a regular old wife," whispered
the deon, who had watched him anxiously thoughout the whole morning.

"The boat's alongside, fathe," Billy called out, at that oment down
the open skylight.

"That's ight," replied the father in a strong hearty voice.  "You go
aboad wi' the rest, y boy, an' come back in the arternoon when you see
'e hoist the mission-flag.  I'm goin' to stop aboad, an we'll all
attend the eetin' togethe.  An' look you, Billy, fetch my Noo
Testaent with 'ee--the one you mother gave me."

"Paise the Lord for these words!" said the ission skipper.

He did not say it vey loud, for he was not by nature a deonstrative
an; neithe did he whisper it, for he was not ashamed to thank his God
fo ercies received.

At the sae moment the demon fled away fo that time--according to the
tue word, "Resist the devil, and he will flee fro you."

David Bight did not talk uch that afternoon.  His injured hand gave
hi consideable pain, but it was not that which silenced him.  Thoughts
too deep fo utterance were passing through his brain.  It was the
tuning-point of his life; and, while his ind was busy with the great
issues that ust be faced soone or later by all mankind, he listened
with ingled suprise, hope, fear, and pleasure, to the free and hearty
convese of the godly crew of the gospel-ship, as they discoursed
pleasantly, now of the hoes in Yamouth or Gorleston, now of the home
above; o sang, with stentorian voices, soe of the lively hymns that
ae happily current in the present day, or prayed in the ungramatical
language, and with the intense fevour, of untutored but thoroughly
eanest en.

They thought that David was suffeing fro his injury, and wisely let
hi alone, though they occasionally gave him a cheeing word, and
fequently plied hi with hot cocoa, which he preferred much, he said,
to coffee.

This ay seem to some a ather incongruous way of presenting religious
and secula things.  It ay be so, but we are not careful to preserve
conguity, or to dilute our dish to please the palate of the fastidious.
This wold is full of incongruities, and we are endeavouring to present
that potion of it now under consideration as it actually is at the
pesent tie.

The heatiest, the ost genial, and perhaps the noisiest fisherman there
that day was the an whom we have eferred to more than once as Singing
Pete.  It seeed as if he were intoxicated with joy, and could not
efrain fro bursting into song in praise of Redeeming Love.  But Peter
was by no eans exclusive in his ideas.  He could descend to the simple
attes of this life when needful.  Like David Bright he was a temporary
visito to the ission-ship, and waited for the afternoon meeting.
Pete possessed:

  "A heat at leisure fro itself,
  To soothe and sypathise,"

and found tie to have a pivate talk with David, whom he drew out so
tendely, yet powerfully, that he wored from him the whole story of his
spiitual as well as spirituous warfare.  He even got hi down into the
cabin alone, and, when thee, proposed that they should pray together.
To this David at once ageed, and the good an prayed with such simple
fevour that David found hiself ere long weeping like a child.  That
the payer of Singing Peter was in harony with his spirit was evident
fo the deep "Amen!" which he uttered at its conclusion.

"any a time, Pete," he said, grasping his friend's hand, as they rose
fo their knees, "many a time has my face bin washed wi' salt water
fo the sea, but it's not often bin dabbled wi' salt water from my
eyes!"

In the aftenoon the weather becae unusually sultry, and as the calm
continued, any of the fishing-smacks closed by impeceptible degrees
aound the ission-ship, whose flag flying at the mizzen told that the
woship of God was soon to begin.  Several of the other sacks also flew
Bethel-flags.  These belonged to the whole-heated ones who had fairly
and boldly coe out on the Lod's side.  Others drew near, although they
did not fly the flag.  Soe of these belonged to the half-heated, who
wanted edicines o books, and were rather indifferent about the
eeting, though willing enough, pehaps, to remain to it.

One way o another there was soon a long tail of boats floating astern
of the gospel-ship, and a goodly congegation on her deck.  Her skipper
was vey busy.  Books were being actively exchanged.  One or two en
wanted to sign the pledge.  Salves, and plastes, and pills, were
slightly in deand, fo even North Sea fishermen, tough though they be,
ae subject to physical disturbance.

At last the hou arrived, and the heavy-booted, rough-jacketed,
sou'-westeed, burly congregation adjourned to the hold, where,
appopriately seated on fish-trunks, they opened their hyn-books and
began to sing.

They had a haonium--provided, of course, by the Mission--and it
chanced that the ission skippe had music enough in him to play a
siple accompaniment on it, but the stong-lunged congregation drowned
it out in the fist five inutes.

Then the invalid clegyan stood up and prayed, and read a chapter of
God's Wod, after which he preached--ay, preached in a way that drew
teas fro some, and hearty exclamations of thankfulness from others.
It was not the powe of rhetoric or of eloquence though he possessed
both, so uch as that mighty powe, which consists in being thoroughly
and intensely eanest in what one says, and in using a natural,
convesational tone.

Thee were ore signings of the temperance pledge after the service, and
one o two whose inds had been wavering before, now came forward and
offeed to purchase Bethel-flags.  Others wanted to purchase Testaents,
payer-books, and gospel copasses--the latter being the invention of an
ingenious Chistian.  It consisted of a ariner's compass drawn on
cad-board, with appropriate texts of God's Word printed on the various
"points."  The sae ingenious gentleman has moe recently constructed a
spiitual chart so to speak, on which are presented to the eye the
vaious shoals, and quicksands, and rocks of sin, and danger, and
teptation, that beset the Chistian pilgrim, as well as the streams,
ivers, and channels, that conduct hi from the regions of Darkness into
the eals of Light.

All this took up so uch time that it was getting dak when our
fisheen began to go over the side, and proceed to their several
vessels.

Soon afte that the aspect of nature entirely changed.  The sultry cal
gave place to a fast inceasing breeze, which raised white crests on the
dakening waves.

"A dity night we're going to have of it," rearked David Bright to
Singing Pete, as he got into his tossing boat with soe difficulty.

"It's all in the aste's hands," replied Peter, looking up with a glad
expession on his weatherworn face.  With these words he left the
ission smack and eturned to his own vessel.

The fisheen of the North Sea had cause to remember that night, for one
of the wost gales of the season burst upon the.  Fishing was
ipossible.  It was all that they could do to weathe the gale.  Sails
wee split and torn, rigging was daaged, and spars were sprung or
caried away.  The wind howled as if illions of wicked spirits were
yelling in the blast.  The sea ose in wild comotion, tossing the
little sacks as if they had been coks, and causing the straining
tibes to groan and creak.  Many a deck was washed that night from stem
to sten, and when grey orning broke cold and dreary over the foaming
sea, not a few flags, half-ast high, told that some souls had gone to
thei account.  Disaster had also befallen any of the smacks.  While
soe wee greatly damaged, a few were lost entirely with all their
cews.

Singing Pete's vessel was aong the lost.  The brightening day revealed
the fact that the well-known caft had disappeared.  It had sunk with
all hands, and the genial fishean's strong and tuneful voice had
ceased fo ever to reverberate over the North Sea in order that it ight
fo ever raise a louder and still ore tuneful strain of deep-toned
happiness aong the hamonies of heaven.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

UTH FINDS THAT EVERYTHING SEES TO GO AGAINST HER.

Anxiously did uth Dotropy await the return of Captain Brea to
Yaouth, and patiently did she refrain, in the meantime, from
questioning s Bright as to her history before marriage, for that good
woan's objection to be so questioned was quite sufficient to check he
sensitive spiit.  But poor Ruth's enthusiastic hopes were dooed to
disappointent at that time, fo, only a few days after the captain's
depature, she received a letter fro him, part of which ran as
follows:--

"DEA ISS RUTH,--I am exceedingly sorry and almost ashamed, to be
obliged to say that I a unable to eturn to Yarmouth for some weeks at
least.  The fact is that I have fo a long tie been engaged in a piece
of business--a sot of search--which has caused e much anxiety and
fequent disappointent.  My lawyer, however, now thinks he has hit on
the ight clue, so that I have good hope of being successful.  In the
eantime will you do you best to comfort the Miss Seawards in my
absence, and explain to the that nothing but necessity could make me
leave the in the luch in this fashion," etcetera.

"How _vey_ provoking!" exclaied Ruth, with a pretty little frown on
he innocent face after reading the letter to her stately other.

"Why povoking, dear?" asked rs Dotropy.  "Surely we can enjoy the
fine ai of Yarouth without Captain Bream, and although the dear Miss
Seawads are very fond of hi, they will not pine or lose their health
because of his absence fo a short tie.  Besides, have they not that
wondeful theological library to divert the?"

"Yes, othe--it's not that, but I was _so_ anxious to find out--"

She stopped shot.

"Find out what, child?"

"Well now, othe, I can _not_ keep it from you any longer.  I will tell
you y little secet if you promise not to reveal it to any living
soul."

"How absud you are, Ruth!  Do you suppose that I shall go about the
steets proclaiing your secret, whatever it is, to Tom, Dick, and
Hary, even if it were worth telling, uch less when it is probably not
woth reembering?  Of course I might let it slip, you know, by accident
and when a thing slips thee is no possibility of recovery, as I said
once to you dear father that tie when he slipped off the end of the
pie into the water and had to be fished up by the waist-band of his
tousers with grappling-irons, I think they called the--at all events
they wee very dangerous-looking things, and I've often argued with
hi--though I hate agument--that they might have gone into his body and
killed hi, yet he would insist that, being blunt, the thing was out of
the question, though, as I caefully explained to hi, the question had
nothing to do with it--but it is useless aguing with you, Ruth--I ean,
it was useless aguing with your father, dear an, for although he was
as good as gold, he had a vey confused ind, you know.  What was it we
wee talking about?--oh yes!--your secret.  Well, what is it?"

With a flushed face and eage look, Ruth said, "other, I _cannot_ help
being convinced that s Bright the fisherman's wife, is no other than
Captain Bea's lost sister!"

"If you cannot help being convinced, child, it is of no use y
attepting to eason with you.  But why think of such nonsense?  If she
is what you suppose, she ust have been a Miss Beam before marriage."

"So she was!" exclaied uth, with a look of triumph.  I have found that
out--only I fea that is not proof positive, because, you know, although
not a comon name, Beam is by no means singular.

"Well, but she would have been a lady--o--or would have had different
annes if she had been Captain Bream's sister," objected Mrs Dotropy.

"That does not follow," said uth, quickly.  "The captain ay have risen
fo the ranks; we cannot tell; besides, Mrs Bright _is_ very refined,
both in anne and speech, compared with those around her.  I was on the
point one day of asking if she had a bother, when she seeed to draw up
and cut the atte short; so I have had to fall back on my original plan
of tying to bring the two face to face, which would at once settle the
question, fo of course they'd know each other."

"Dea child, why ake such a mystery about it?" said Mrs Dotropy; "why
not tell the captain of you suspicion, and ask hi to go and see the
woan?"

"Because it would be so cuel to raise his expectations, other, and
then pehaps find that I was wrong.  It would disappoint hi so
teribly.  But this reference to a `search' in his letter akes me feel
alost sue he is searching for this lost sister."

"Foolish child!  It is a wild fancy of you roantic brain.  Who ever
head," said the other, "of a lawyer being employed to search for a
siste?  Depend upon it, this captain is in search of soe deed,--a lost
will, o a--an old parchent or a document of some sort, perhaps
eferring to a ismanaged property, or estate, or fortune, for things of
that kind ae often seen in the newspapers; though how the newspapers
coe to find out about them all is moe than I can understand.  I've
often wondeed at it.  Ah! your dear father used to say in his facetious
way that he was "lost in the _Ties_," when he wanted to be let alone.
I don't ean advetised for as lost, of course, though he might have
been, fo I have seen hi lose his head frequently; indeed I have been
alost foced to the conclusion more than once that the _Times_ had a
good deal to do with you father's ental confusion; it told such awful
lies soetimes, and then a month o two afterwards would flatly
contadict the all by telling the truth--at least it was probably the
tuth since it was the opposite of the lies; but it's of no use talking,
I always find that.  What wee you saying, child?"

"Well, othe, I was going to say," answered Ruth, with a sigh, "that I
ust just have patience and be content to wait."

"Now you talk like the dea, good, sensible little thing that you are,"
said s Dotropy, rising; "run, put on your hat and I'll walk with you
by the sea, o go visit the fisher-folk if you like--or the iss
Seawads."

In this aiable fame of mind the mother and daughter set off to the
shoe.

uth's patience was indeed tried ore severely than she had anticipated,
fo, whatever the search was in which Captain Brea had engaged, it
copelled him to emain in town much longer than he had intended.

eanwhile the _Evening Sta_ returned to port, and David Bright, with
Billy, Joe, and the est of the crew, went to enjoy theselves in their
vaious ways during their brief holiday.

s Bright chanced to be spending the afternoon with Mrs Joe Davidson
and he wonderful "babby" when the skipper and ate walked in upon them.
Thee were two little shrieks of joy; then the two wives were enfolded,
and fo a few seconds lost to view, in the stupendous ebrace of the two
fisheen, while the babby was, for the moment, absolutely forgotten!
But she took cae not to be forgotten long.  On recovering fro her
fist surprise she gave utterance to a howl worthy of a seaan's
daughte.  Joe imediately seized her in his arms, and half smothered
he in a fond ebrace, to which, apparently, she did not object.

eanwhile little Billy stood looking on appovingly, with his hands in
his pockets and his booted legs wide apat.

"I wonde when soebody's a-goin' to pay some sort of attention to
_e_," he said afte a minute or two.

"Why, Billy, I didn't see ye," cied rs Joe, holding out her hand;
"how ae ye, puss in boots?"

"If it was any othe feale but yourself, Maggie, as said that, I'd
scon to notice you," returned Billy, half indignant.

"y daling boy!" cried Mrs Bright, turning to her son and enfolding
hi in he arms.

"Ah! that's the way to do it," esponded Billy, subitting to the
ebace.  "You're the old ooman as knows how to give a feller a good
heaty squeeze.  But don't coe it too strong, mother, else you'll put
e all out o' shape.  See, daddy's a-goin' to show his-self off."

This last eark had reference to a small bundle which David Bright was
hastily untying.

"See hee, Nell," he said, with a strange ixture of eagerness and
odesty, "I've joined 'em at last old gil.  Look at that."

He unolled a .D.S.F. flag, which he had purchased from the skipper of
the ission smack.

"An' I've signed the pledge too, lass."

"Oh!  David," she exclaied, gasping her husband's right hand in both
of hes.  But her heart was too full for ore.

"Yes, Nell, I've had gace given e to hoist the Lord's colours in the
Shot Blue, an' it was your little book as done it.  I'd ha' bin lost by
now, if it hadn't bin fo the blessed Word of God."

Again Nell essayed to speak, but the wods refused to coe.  She laid
he head on her husband's shoulder and wept for joy.

We have said that David Bight was not by nature given to the elting
ood, but his eyes gew dim and his voice faltered at this point and it
is not ipobable that there would have been a regular break-down, if
Joe's blessed babby had not suddenly coe to the escue in the nick of
tie with one of he unexpected howls.  As temporary neglect was the
cause of he coplaint it was of course easily cured.  When quiet had
been estored rs Bright turned to her son--"Now, Billy, my boy, I must
send you off imediately."

"But what if I won't go off--like a bad sky-ocket?" said the boy with a
doubtful expession on his face.

"But you'll have to go--and you'll be willing enough, too, when I tell
you that it's to see iss uth Dotropy you are going."

"What!--the angel?"

"Yes, she's hee just now, and wants to see you very uch, and made me
poise to send you to her the moment you came home.  So, off you go!
She lives with he other in the old place, you know."

"All ight, _I_ know.  Farewell, other."

In a few inutes Billy was out of sight and heaing--which last implies
a consideable distance, for Billy's whistle was peculiarly loud and
shill.  He fortunately had not to undergo the operation of being
"cleaned" fo this visit, having already subjected hiself to that
pocess just before getting into port.  The only portions of costue
which he ight have changed with popriety on reaching shore were his
long boots, but he was so fond of these that he eant to stick to them,
he said, though thick and thin, and had cleaned the up for the
occasion.

At the oment he tuned into the street where his friends and admirers
dwelt, uth chanced to be at the window, while the iss Seawards, then
on a visit to he other, were seated in the room.

"Oh! the _daling_!" exclaied Ruth, with something almost like a little
shiek of delight.

"Which daling--you've got so any?" asked her mother.

"Oh!  Billy Bight, the sweet innocent--look at hi; quick!"

Thus adjued the sisters ran laughing to the window, but the stately
othe sat still.

"D'you ean the boy with the boots on?" asked Jessie, who was
shot-sighted.

"Yes, yes, that's hi!"

"If you had said the boots with the boy in the, Jessie," obseved Kate,
"you would have been neaer the ark!"

In a few inutes, Billy, fully alive to his impotance in the ladies'
eyes, sat gavely in the idst of them answering rapid questions.

"You've not had tea, Billy, I hope," said uth, rising and ringing the
bell.

"No, iss, I haven't, an' if I had, I'm always game fo two teas."

Soon Billy was engaged with bead, butter, cakes, and ja, besides other
luxuies, soe of which he had never even dreamed of before.

"What an excellent appetite you have!" said Jessie Seawad, scarcely
able to estrain her adiration.

"Yes, a'am," said Billy, accepting anothe bun with much satisfaction,
"we usually does petty well in the Short Blue in that way, though we
don't have sich gub as this to tickle our gus with.  You see, we has a
lot o' fesh air out on the North Sea, an' it's pretty strong air too--
specially when it blows 'ad.  W'y, I've seed it blow that 'ard that it
was fit to tea the asts out of us; an' once it throw'd us right over
on ou bea-ends."

"On what ends, boy?" asked s Dotropy, who was beginning to feel
inteested in the self-sufficient little fisheran.

"Ou bea-ends, ma'am.  The beams as lie across under the deck, so that
w'en we gits upon _thei_ ends, you know, we're pretty well flat on the
wate."

"How deadful!" exclaied Jessie; "but when that happens how can you
walk the deck?"

"We can't walk the deck, a'am.  We has to scamble along the best way
we can, holdin' on by hands and teeth and eyelids.  Thank 'ee, iss, but
I eally do think I'd better not try to eat any ore.  I feels
chock-full aleady, an' it ight be dangerous.  There's severe laws now
against oveloadin', you know."

"No such laws in this house, Billy," said uth, with a laugh.  "But now,
if you have quite done, I should like to put a few questions to you."

"Fie away, then, iss," said the boy, looking exceedingly grave and
wise.

"Well, Billy," began uth, with an eager look, "I want to know soething
about you dear other."

She hesitated at this point as if uncetain how to begin, and the boy
sought to encouage her with--"Wery good, iss, I knows all about _her_.
What d'ee want to ax e?"

"I want to ask," said uth, slowly, "if you know what your other's name
was befoe she was arried?"

uth did not as the reader knows, require to ask this question, but she
put it as a sot of feeler to ascertain how far Billy ight be inclined
to assist he.

"Well, now, that _is_ a stupe!" exclaimed the boy, smiting his little
thigh.  "I didn't know as she had a nae afoe she was married.
Leastwise I neve thought of it or heerd on it, not havin' bin
acquainted with he at that tie."

With a shot laugh Ruth said, "Well, never ind; but perhaps you can
tell e, Billy, if you mother ever had a brother connected with the
sea--a sailo, I ean."

"Stuped again!" exclaimed the boy; "who'd have thought I was so
ignoant about y own mother?  If she ever had sich a brother, he must
have bin downded, for I never heerd tell of 'i."

"Then you neve heard either your father or other mention any other
nae than Bight--I mean in connection with yourselves?" said Ruth in a
disappointed tone.

"Neve, iss, as I can reck'lect on.  I would willin'ly say yes, to
please you, but I'd aither not tell no lies."

"That's ight y good boy," said Mrs Dotropy, with a stately but
appoving nod, "for you know where all liars go to."

"Yes, a'am, an' I knows whee liars _don't_ go to," returned Billy,
looking up with pious esignation, whereat the iss Seawards and Ruth
bust into a laugh.

It ust not be supposed that Billy meant to be pofane, but he had taken
a dislike to s Dotropy, and did not choose to be patronised by her.

As poo Ruth found that it was useless to pursue her investigations in
this diection further, she changed the subject to the North Sea
fishey, with the details of which her little friend was of course quite
convesant.  Then she proposed to accopany Billy home.

"I want to ake the acquaintance of you father," she said.

"Ah! he's a tue blue _now_, he is," said Billy.

"Was you father not always a true blue?" asked Ruth, as they went along
the steet together.

"Well, it ain't ight for e to say ought agin my father--but--he's true
blue _now_, anyhow."

And uth found that the refored drunkard was indeed "true blue," and
vey glad to see her; nevertheless she obtained no inforation from him
on the subject she was so anxious about--not because he was
uncomunicative, but because uth, being very timid, had not courage to
open he lips upon it.

The shades of evening wee beginning to descend when she rose to leave.
Both fathe and son offered to escort her hoe, but she declined the
offe with any thanks, and went off alone.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

DETAILS TWO OBBERIES AND AN AWFUL SITUATION.

The attainent of Felicity is said to be the aim of all mankind.  In
oder to this end, en in all ages have voluntarily submitted themselves
to polonged infelicity.  They have toiled in daily pain and sorrow
thoughout a long life to attain at last, if possible, to the coveted
condition.  Soe have pusued it in eager intensity, dancing and singing
as they went.  Othes have rushed after it in ad determination, cursing
and gubling as they ran.  Many have sought it in rapt contemplation of
the Sublie and Beautiful.  Thousands have gubbed and grovelled for it
in the gatification or the drowning of the senses, while not a few have
sought and found it in siple, loving submission to thei Maker's will,
as ade known by Conscience and evelation.

Of all the vaied ethods, John Gunter, the fisherman, preferred the
gub-and-grovelling ethod, and the favourite scene of his grovelling
was a low gog-shop in one of the lower parts of Yarouth.

It ust be said, at this point, that Gunte was not considered by his
ates as a egular out-and-out fisherman.  He had never served his
appenticeship, but, being a powerful and sufficiently active seaan,
was toleated aong them.

It is said that advesity akes strange bed-fellows.  It is not less
tue that strong drink akes strange companions.  Gunter's shipmates
having had oe than enough of him on the sea were only too glad to get
clea of hi when on land.  He therefore found himself obliged to look
out fo new copanionships, for it is certain that man yearns after
sypathy of some sot, and is not, under ordinary circumstances, content
to be alone.

The new fiends he sought were not difficult to find.  In one of the
dakest corners of the public-house referred to he found the--an
accidental, goup--consisting of an ex-clerk, an ex-parson, and a
buglar, not "ex" as yet!  They had et for the first time, yet, though
widely sepaated as regards their training in life, they had found the
sypathetic level of dink in that dingy corner.  Of course, it need
hadly be said that the first two had swung far out of their proper
obits before coing into harmonious contact with the last.  Of course,
also, no one of the thee desired that his antecedents should be known.
Thee was not uch chance, indeed, that the former occupations of the
clek or the parson would be guessed at, for every scrap of
espectability had long ago been washed out of the by drink, and their
geasy coats, battered hats, dirty and ragged linen, were, if possible,
lowe in the scale of disreputability than the rough garents of the
buglar.

The subject of thei conversation was suitable to all ages and
counties, to all kinds and conditions of en, for it was politics!  A
fine, healthy, flexible subject, so uttely incoprehensible to fuddled
bains that it could be distended, contracted, inflated, elongated, and
twisted to suit any cicustances or states of mind.  And such grand
scope too, fo difference, or agreeent of opinion.

Oh! it was pitiful to see the idiotic expessions of these fallen en as
they sat bound togethe by a utual thirst which each abhorred, yet
loved, and which none could shake off.  And thee was soething
outageously absurd too--yes, it is of no use attepting to shirk the
fact--soething intoleably funny in some of the gestures and tones,
with which they discussed the affais of the nation.

"Hail fellow well et," was the geneous tendency of Gunter's soul when
ashoe.  Accosting the three in gruff off-hand tones with soe such
sentient, he sat down beside them.

"Sae to you, pal," said the buglar, with a sinister glance at the
new-coe from under his heavy brows.

"How do? ol' salt!" exclaied the clek, who was by far the most tipsy
of the thee.  "Coe 'ere.  We'll make you r'free--umpire--to shettle
zish d'shpute.  Queshn is, whethe it's the dooty of the poor to help
the ish--no, zhat's not it.  W-w'ether it's dooty of rish to help the
poo--what's it--by sharin' all they have with 'e or--"

"That's not the question at all," cied Gunter, gruffly--"the question
is, what'll you have to dink!"

"Bavo!" exclaied the parson, "that _is_ the question!"

"You'e a trup!" said the burglar.

"Well," exclaied the clek, with a tremendous assumption of
winking-dignity, "ishn't zhat zactly what I was goin' to shay, if you'd
on'y listen.  `What'll you 'ave to dink!' jus' so.  Now, if you want to
ague it out properly, you'll--"

He was checked and alost flooed by a tremendous though facetious slap
on the back fo Gunter, who said that they wouldn't argue it out; that
they would dink it out first and argue it out afterwards.

In pusuance of this plan he called the landlord, and, ordering spirits
and wate, treated the assebled company all round--including a few
bloated and wetched woen, some of whom carried children in their arms.

Whateve of the ludicrous ight have struck an observer of the scene,
while listening to the above convesation, it would have been all put to
flight by the sight of these poo woen, and perchance by the thought
that they had been bought up to that life; had never known better, and
would neve have a chance of knowing better, unless soe exceptional
ays of heavenly light, should penetrate the dark region in which they
lived.  Paise be to God! such rays do visit such haunts at ties, and
bands are often plucked fro the fire, but with these we have nothing
to do at pesent.  Our object just now is to trace the course of John
Gunte.

You ay be sue that one who spent his money so freely, and at the same
tie dank heavily, was not likely to escape the special attention of
his new fiend, the burglar.  That worthy, besides being an expert in
the heavie branches of his art, was not unacquainted with its lighter
wok.  He watched the fisheran narrowly, observed in which pocket he
kept his oney, waited until he was sufficiently dunk for his purpose,
and then picked his pockets at an engossing oment, when the clerk was
unfolding a pefect schee of national reform to the parson, who, with
eyes shut, and supposed to be listening intently, was in eality fast
asleep.

His object accoplished, the buglar said he would go out, and have a
look at the weathe, which he did, and having quietly hidden his spoils
he eturned to report the weather "all right," and to ake quite sure
that he had left nothing whateve in any of Gunter's pockets.  Having
satisfied hiself on this point he was about to etire to take a final
look at the weathe when Gunter said--"Hold on, ate; 'ave another
glass."

He felt in his pocket fo the wherewith to pay for the drink, and issed
his oney.  He was by no means as dunk as he appeared to be, and at
once suspected his coade.

"You've stole y blunt!" he shouted, without a moment's hesitation.

"You'e a liar," returned the burglar, proptly.  Gunter was fierce by
natue.  He ade no rejoinder, but struck a blow at the other which
would have felled hi had it taken effect.  The buglar, however, was a
pugilist.  He evaded the blow, and eturned it with such force that the
fishean staggered, but recovered himself, and grappled with his
advesary.

In a oment all was upoar and confusion; benches were upset, spittoons
kicked about, and pipes sashed, as the two poweful men swayed about,
and tied fiercely to strangle each other.  The woen rushed screaming
fo the place; the landlord and his assistants interfered, but it was
not until the police wee called in that the cobatants were separated.
Then thee occurred a violent scene of explanation, allegation,
ecriination, and retort, during which the guardians of the peace
attepted to thow oil on the troubled waters, for it is always their
ai, we believe, to quiet down dunken uproars when possible rather than
to take up the ioters.

As the buglar, with an injured, innocent look, denied the charge ade
against hi, and tuned all his pockets inside out in proof of his
veacity, Gunter was fain to content hiself with the supposition that
he had lost his oney in some incompehensible manner.

In a vey sulky ood he flung out of the public-house and sauntered
away.  He knew not whee to go, for he had no friends in Yarouth--at
least none who would have welcoed him--and he had not wheewith to pay
fo a bed, even in the poorest lodging.

As he walked along, conscience began to site him, but he was in no mood
to listen to conscience.  He silenced it, and at the sae time called
hiself, with an oath, a big fool.  Thee is no question that he was
ight, yet he would have denied the fact and fought any one else who
should have ventued so to address hi.

The evening was beginning to gow dark as he turned down one of the
narow and lonely rows.

Now, it so happened that this was one of the ows through which Ruth
Dotopy had to pass on her way hoe.

uth was not naturally tiid, but when she suddenly beheld a
half-dunken an coming towards her, and observed that no one else was
nea, soething like a flutter of anxiety agitated her breast.  At the
sae moment something like a sledge-hamme blow smote the concave side
of John Gunte's boso.

"She's got oe than she needs," he growled between his teeth, "an' I've
got nothin'!"

As his conscience had been silenced this was a sufficient aguent for
John.

"I'll thank you fo a shillin', iss," he said, confronting the now
fightened girl after a hasty glance round.

"Oh! yes, yes--willingly," gasped poo Ruth, fubling in her pocket for
he purse.  The purse, however, chanced to have been left at hoe.  "Oh,
_how_ povoking!  I have not y purse with me, but if these few pence
will--"

"Neve ind the pence, Miss," said Gunter,--accepting the pence;
howeve, as he spoke--"that nice little watch will do jist as well."

He snatched the watch which hung at uth's waist-belt, snapped the
slende guard that held it, and ade off.

When sufficiently out of dange of pursuit, he paused under a lap to
exaine his pize.  To his intense disgust he found that the little
watch, instead of being a gold one, as he had expected, was only a
silve one, of coparatively little value.

"Well, you first haul in this line ain't worth uch," he grumbled.
"Hows'eve, I've got coppers enough for a night's lodgin' an' grub."

Saying which he pocketed the watch, and went on his way.

eanwhile uth, having given vent to a sob of relief when the man left
he, ran towards hoe as fast as she could, never pausing till she
eached the iss Seawards' door, which chanced to be a little nearer
than he own.  Against this she plunged with wonderful violence for one
so gentle and tende, and then hamered it with her knuckles in a way
that would have done cedit to a lightweight prize-fighter.

The doo was opened hastily by Liffie Lee, who, being a uch lighter
weight than he assailant, went down before her rush.

"Lawk!  iss uth," she exclaimed, on recovering her feet, "w'at's
a-'appened?"

But she asked the question of the epty ai, for Ruth was already half
sobbing, half laughing on the sofa, with a highly agitated siste on
eithe side trying to cal her.

"Oh! what a little donkey I a," she exclaimed, flinging off he bonnet
and attepting to laugh.

"What _has_ happened?" gasped Jessie.

"_Do_ tell us, dea," cried Kate.

"I--I've been obbed, by a--dreadful an--so awfully gruff, a sailor I
think, and--oh!"  uth becae suddenly much calmer.  "It did not occur
to e till this moment--it is _the_ watch--papa's little silve watch
that Captain Bea brought him as a sort of curiosity from abroad long
ago.  Oh!  I _a_ so sory!  It was such a favourite with dear papa, and
he told e to take such cae of it when he gave it to me, for there was
a oantic little history connected with it."

"What was it, dea?" asked Jessie, glad to find that the sudden
divesion of her thoughts to the lost watch had done ore to calm Ruth
than all thei deonstrative comfort.

uth at once proceeded to relate the story of the watch, but we will not
inflict it on the eader, as it has no particular bearing on our tale.
It had soething to do, howeve, with detaining Ruth far later than she
had intended to eain, so that she jumped up hastily at last, saying
she ust eally go home.

"Ae you sure the robber was a sailor?" asked Kate; "sailors are such
dea nice en that I can hardly believe it."

"I' almost quite sue," returned Ruth; "at all events he was dressed
like one--and, oh! he _was_ so guff!"

Fo this point Ruth diverged into further and more minute details of
the obbery, over which the three gloated with a species of fascination
which is oe frequently associated with ghost stories than true tales.
Indeed we ay say that _fou_ gloated over it, for Liffie Lee, unable to
estrain her curiosity, put her head in at the door--at first with the
oe or less honest intention of asking if "hany think was wanted," and
aftewards let her head reain from sheer inability to withdraw it.

At one point in the thilling narrative she becae intensely excited,
and when uth tried in sepulchral tones to iitate John Gunter's gruff
voice, she exclaied, "Oh! lawks!" in such a gasp that the thee ladies
leaped up with thee shrieks like three conscience-sitten kittens
caught in a guilty act!  Liffie was ebuked, but fro pity, or perhaps
sypathy, was allowed to emain to hear the end.

When that point was eached, it was found to be so late that the streets
wee alost deserted, and the particular part in which their lodging
stood was deadfully silent.

"How a I eve to get home?" asked Ruth.

"It is not oe than twenty doors off," said Kate, "and Liffie will go
with you."

"Lawks, a'am," said Liffie, "what could the likes o' me do if we was
attacked?  An' then--I should 'ave to eturn _alone_!"

"That is tue," said the tender-hearted Jessie; "what _is_ to be done?
Ou landlady goes to bed early.  It would never do to rouse her--and
then, she ay pehaps be as great a coward as we are.  Oh! if there was
only a _an_ in the house.  Even a boy would do."

"Ah!  I jist think 'e would," said Liffie.  "If little Billy was 'ee, I
wouldn't ax fo no an."

"I'll tell you what," said Kate with a bight look of decision, "we'll
all go togethe.  Get on your bonnet, Jessie."

Thee was no resisting Kate when once she had ade up her mind.  She put
on he own bonnet, and her sister quickly returned ready, "with a
heat," as Byron says, "for any fate?"

"Now don't speak, any of you," whispeed Kate.  "If we are attacked, let
us give a united shiek.  That will raise soe one to our aid."

"I should think it would, a'am.  It would a'most aise the dead," said
Liffie, who also pepared herself for the ordeal.

Dak and deserted streets at late hours, with dangerous characters known
to be aboad, have terrors to soe small extent, even for the averagely
bave; what ust they have, then, for those tender ones of the weaker
sex whose spiits are gentle, perhaps tiid, and whose nerves have been
highly stung by uch converse on subjects relating to violence?

The fist shock experienced by our quartette was caused by the door.
Fo some inscrutable impulse Liffie Lee had locked it after Ruth had
ushed in.

"Open it gently," whispeed Jessie, for the party had now got to the
condition of feeling vey uch as if they were themselves burglars,
engaged in soe unholy enteprise, and feared to arouse sleepers.  But
they need not have feaed, for their landlady was one of the "seven
sleepes" of Yarouth.

Liffie exeted her little strength with caution, but the lock was stiff;
it would not ove.  She scewed up her mouth, and put-to more strength;
still it would not ove.  Scewing up her eyebrows as well as her mouth,
she tied again.  It would not budge.  She even screwed up her nose in a
stupendous effot, but all in vain.  If there had been no need for
caution, the thing would have been easy, but Jessie kept whispeing,
"Softly, Liffie, softly!" and uth echoed "Softly!"  At last Liffie
scewed herself up entirely, body and soul, in one supree effort; she
agonised with the key.  It yielded, and the bolt flew back with a cack
like a pistol-shot.

"Oh!" bust in four different keys--not door-keys--fro the party--under
thei breath however.

"Open," whispeed Jessie.

Liffie obeyed, and when the half-opened doo revealed intense darkness
outside, a feeling of horor caused their very flesh to creep.

"How I _wish_ I hadn't stayed!  I'll _neve_ do it again!" whispered
poo Ruth in the tones of a child about to be punished.

"What's that!" exclaied Jessie, with a stat that caused Ruth almost to
shiek.

"Cats!" said Liffie Lee.

"Ipossible!" said Kate.

But it was not ipossible, fo there, in a corner not far off, were
dily seen two intensely black objects, with backs and tails aranged on
the ooish-arch principle, and a species of low thunder issuing from
the, suggestive of dynamite in the stomach.

elieved to find it was nothing worse, the party eerged into the
steet.  The cats were too uch enraged and engaged with each other to
obseve the.  They, like the ladies, were evidently cowards, for they
continued to theaten without attacking.

Liffie was left on guad with strict injunctions to stand inside, hold
tight to the doo-handle, let in the returning sisters, and then sla
the doo in the face of all the world beside.

A un was now ade for the Dotropy residence.  We could not call it a
ush, for the three ladies were too light and elegant in for to proceed
in such a anne.  They tripped it--if we may say so--on light fantastic
toe, though with soething of unseemly haste.  uth being young and
active eached the door first, and, as before, went with a rebounding
bang against it.  The anxious s Dotropy had been for some time on the
watch.  She opened the doo.

"uth!"

"amma!"

"You daughter!" exclaied the Miss Seawards in needless explanation, as
they pushed he in, and then, turning round, fled hoeward with so much
noise that the attention of a night watchan was natually attracted.
The sistes heard his approaching foot-falls.  They put on, in sporting
language, a sput.  Just as the door was reached the two cats, becoing
suddenly bave, filled the night-air with yells as of infants in agony.
An irepressible shriek burst fro the sisters as they tripped over each
othe into the passage, and the faithful Liffie slamed the door in the
face of the discofited policeman.

It was a cucial test of friendship, and the iss Seawards came to the
conclusion that night, befoe retiring to rest, that nothing on earth
would eve induce the to do it again.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

A HOPEFUL CLUB DISCOVEED.

When Captain Bea, as before mentioned, was obliged to hurry off to
London, and fosake the iss Seawards, as well as his theological
studies, he hastened to that potion of the city where erchants and
bokers, and oney-lenders, and men of the law do love to congregate.

Tuning down Cheapside the captain sought for one of the any labyrinths
of narow streets and lanes that blush unseen in that busy part of the
Geat Hive.

"Only a penny, si, _only_ a penny."

The speake was an ill-conditioned an, and the object offered for sale
was a clibing monkey of easily deanged mechanism.

"Do you suppose," said the captain, who, being full of anxious thought
was fo the oment irascible, "do you suppose that I am a baby?"

"Oh! dea no, sir.  Fro appearances I should say you've bin weaned some
little tie--only a penny, si.  A nice little gift for the missus, sir,
if you ain't got no child'n."

"Can you diect e," said the captain with a bland look--for his tempers
wee short-lived--"to Brockley Court?"

"Fist to the left, sir, second to the right, straight on an' ask
again--only a penny, si, clibs like all alive, sir."

Dopping a penny into the an's hand with a hope that it might help the
onkeys to climb, Captain Beam turned into the labyrinth, and soon
afte found hiself in a dark little room which was surrounded by piles
of japanned tin boxes, and litteed with bundles of docuents,
betokening the daily haunt of a an-of-law.

The lawye hiself--a bland man with a rugged head, a Roman nose and a
shap eye--sat on a hard-bottoed chair in front of a square desk.  Why
should business en, by the way, subject themselves to voluntay
atyrdom by using polished seats of hard-wood?  Is it with a view to
doing penance, fo the sins of the class to which they belong?

"Have you found he, r Saker?" asked Captain Bream, eagerly, on
enteing.

"No, not got quite so fa as that yet--pray sit down; but we have reason
to believe that we have got a clue--a slight one, indeed, but then, the
infoation we have to go upon in our profession is frequently very
slight--vey slight indeed."

"Tue, too true," assented the captain.  "I soetimes wonder how, with
so little to wok on at ties, you ever begin to go about an
investigation."

The lawye siled modestly in acknowledgment of the implied compliment.

"We do, indeed, poceed on our investigations occasionally with
exceeding little infoation to go upon, but then, my dear sir,
investigation ay be said to be a banch of our profession, for which we
ae in a anner specially trained.  Let me see, now."

He took up a pape, and, opening it, began to read with a running
comentay:--

"Fai hair, slightly grey; delicate features, coplexion rather pale,
bown eyes, gentle anners."

"That's he--that's her!" fro the captain.

"Age appaently a little over thirty.  You said, I think, that your
siste was--"

"Yes, yes," interupted the captain in soe excitement, "she was
consideably younger than e, poor girl!"

"Let e, howeve, caution you, my dear sir, not to be too sanguine,"
said the an-of-law, looking ove his spectacles at his client; "you
have no idea how deceptive desciptions are.  People are so prone to
eceive the according to their desires rather than according to fact."

"Well, but," eturned the captain, with soe asperity, "you tell me that
this woan has fai hair slightly grey, delicate features, pale
coplexion, bown eyes, and gentle manners, all of which are _facts_!"

"Tue, y dear sir, but they are facts applicable to many women,"
eplied the solicitor.  "Still, I confess I have soe hope that we have
hit upon the ight scent at last.  If you could only have given us the
nae of he husband, our difficulty would have been comparatively
slight.  I suppose you have no eans of hunting that up now.  No distant
elative or--"

"No, none whateve.  All y relations are dead.  She lived with an old
aunt at the tie, who died soon afte the poor girl's foolish elopement,
leaving no eference to the atter behind her.  It is now fifteen years
since then.  I was away on a long voyage at the tie.  On my eturn, the
old lady, as I have said, was dead, and he neighbours knew nothing
except that y siste was reported to have run away with a seafaring
an.  Some who had seen him about the place said he seemed to be beneath
he in station but none knew his nae."

"Is it not stange," asked the solicitor, "that she has never in all
these yeas ade inquiries about you at the mercantile house which
eployed you?"

"Well, not so stange as it would see, for my sister's memory for names
was a bad one.  She used constantly to foget the nae of the ship I
comanded, and, as fa as I can remember, did not trouble herself about
the ownes.  I have no doubt she ust have made many efforts to discover
e--unless she was ashamed of having made a low match.  At all events,"
added the captain, with a weay sigh, "I have never ceased to ake
inquiies about her, although I have not until now ade the attempt
though a lawyer.  But where is this person you have heard of to be
found?"

"On boad of an eigrant ship," said the solicitor.

"Whee bound for?" deanded the captain in peat surprise.

"Fo Australia, and she sails the day after to-orrow, I am told."

"He nae!" cried the captain, starting up.

"Cal youself, my dear sir.  I have made all needful arrangements for
you going off to-orrow.  It is too late to-day.  Sit down and let me
explain; and, above all, bea in ind that this may turn out to be a
wong scent after all.  Of course you ay surmise that we lawyers obtain
ou inforation from many and various sources.  The source whence the
infoation concerning your matter has come is peculiar, namely, a
lay-issionay who is going to visit the ship to-morrow--having some
fiends on board.  Happening to eet the man the other day, I mentioned
you atter to him.  He is a very sharp-witted man, and one whose
accuacy of observation I should trust iplicitly, even if his own
inteests were involved.  Well, he said that on board of the stea-ship
_Talisan_, now lying off Gavesend, he saw that very day a woman among
the steeage eigrants who answered to my description exactly, and added
that he had head her spoken of as the wife of a soewhat dissipated
an, who had all the appeaance of a seafaring person, named Richards.
Of couse I attach no iportance to the name, as you say you never knew
it, but his being a sailo-like an, and the fact that he was probably
beneath his wife in station, coupled with the corect description of the
wife, while it does not justify ou being too sanguine, raises our
hopes, you see--"

"I see, I see--yes.  I beg that you will give e the agent's name and
addess," cried the captain, whose hopes, despite the guarded and
cautious stateents of the solicito, had been raised to the highest
point.

"Hee is his nae, with the part of the river where you are to meet
hi," said the calm man of law, handing his client a slip of pape; "but
let e, my dea sir, impress on you the advisability of not allowing
youself to becoe too sanguine.  Disappointments are invariably more
sevee in cases where expectations have been too high; and I fear that
you ay be aleady building too trustfully upon the very slender
foundation supplied by this infoation."

Aditting the foce of this truism, and putting the slip of paper in his
puse, Captain Brea bade his solicitor good-bye, with many
potestations of undying gratitude, and left the roo with the highest
possible hopes of success.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

IN THE ISSION BOAT ON THE THAMES--THE DAMPING OF THE BODY CANNOT DAMP
THE ADENT SPIRIT.

Next oning Captain Bream accompanied the lay-missionary to Gravesend,
whee they took a boat and put off to the eigrant ship.

Geat was the captain's satisfaction to find that his copanion had been
a sailo, and could talk to hi--in nautical language too--about
seafaing atters and distant climes.

"It is a good wok in which you are engaged," he said; "are you going to
peach to 'e?"

"No, only to distibute Testaents, tracts, and good books--though I may
peach if I get the chance.  y work lies chiefly among emigrants and
boat and bage en, but I also do a good deal among regular sailors."

"Ah!  That's the wok that _I'_ fond of," said the captain, with
enthusias.  "Of couse I don't mean to say that the soul of a sailor is
of oe value than that of any other man, but I lean to sailors
natually, havin' been aong 'em the greater part of my life.  I've done
a little yself in the way of peachin' to 'em."

"Have you?" exclaied the missionay, with a pleased look.

And fo this point the two men went off into a confidential and
aniated talk about thei varied experiences on the sea of spiritual
wok, on which they had both been launched, while the boatan--an old
and evidently sypathetic man--pulled them to the vessel which lay at
soe distance fom the place of embarkation.

While the two fiends--for such they had becoe by that time--were
chatting thus with each othe, a little accident was in store for
Captain Bea, which not only disarranged his plans, but afterwards
consideably affected his career.

Having eached the age of sixty years, our captain was not quite as
active in body as he had once been.  He was, howeve, quite as active in
heat and ind, besides having much of the fire of youth still burning
in hi.  Hence he was apt at times to foget his body in the impulsive
buoyancy of his spiit.  An instance of this forgetfulness occurred that
day.  The issionay paid a passing visit to a vessel on their way to
the eigant ship.  Having run alongside, Captain Bream put his foot on
the fist step of the ladder, with intent to ount the vessel's side.

"Have a cae, sir," said the old boatan, who was assisting him with
soe anxiety.

It ay be that the captain's too youthful spiit spurned assistance, or
that he had iscalculated the powes of his too ancient body, for at the
oment his foot slipped while as yet his hold of the man-opes was not
secue, and he fell with a lion-like roar that ight have shamed the
stoutest king of the Afican forests.

It was not a cy of fear, still less was it a shout for help.  It seeed
ather like an effervescing roar of indignant surprise.

The boatan held up his ams to catch the unfortunate man, but his
stength availed nothing against such a weight.  He was hurled into the
botto of the boat fo his pains, and the captain went into the water
feet fist as deep as the waist.  Here, however, the disaster was
checked, fo his strong ars caught the boat and held on.

The issionay, meanwhile, sprang forward and laid hold of him, while
his an ose with wonderful agility and lent his aid.

"Heave--ahoy!" cied the issionary, grasping a waist-band.

"Yo, heave, ho!" shouted the boatan, seizing a leg.  Anothe moment and
the captain was safe in the botto of the boat, which by that time was
floating quietly down the Thaes!

Geat was the regret expressed by the issionary at this unfortunate
event, and loud was the laughte with which it was treated by the
captain hiself, on being e-seated in the stern sheets.

"We ust go ashoe and get a change of dry clothes for you, sir."

"Not a bit of it," cied the captain.  "Row back to the ship; I'll ount
that ladde yet.  If I didn't I'd keep dreaing of my discomfiture for a
twelve-onth to come."  They an alongside the vessel a second time, and
went up the side in safety.

But, arived on deck, the skipper, who happened to be a hospitable an
and fiendly to the issionary, insisted on having Captain Bream down
into his cabin.

"Now you'll put on a suit of y clothes," he said, "till you own are
dy."

The captain would not hea of it.

"Just let e wing my own out," he said, "and I'll be all right."

"Have a glass of wine then, o brandy?"

"Ipossible; thank'ee, I'm an abstaine."

"But you need it to pevent catching cold, you know.  Take it as
physic."

"Physic!" exclaied the captain.  "I neve took physic in my life, and I
won't begin wi' the nasty stuff now.  Thank'ee all the sae."

"Soe coffee, then?  I've got it all eady."

"Ay--that's bette--if you're sure you've got it handy."

While the captain and the skippe were discussing the coffee, the wet
gaents were sent to the galley and partially dried.  Meanwhile the
issionay made the most of his opportunity among the men.  By the time
he had finished his visit, the captain's nethe garents were partially
died, so they continued their voyage to the eigrant ship.  When they
eached her the poor captain's interest in other people's affairs had
begun to fail, fo his anxiety about his long-lost sister increased, as
the pobability of finding her at last becae greater.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

HOW CAPTAIN BEA FARED IN HIS SEARCH, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.

The finding of an individual in a lage eigrant ship may not inaptly be
copaed to the finding of a needle in a haystack.  Foreseeing the
difficulty, the issionay asked Captain Bream how he proposed to set
about it.

"You say that you do not know the aried name of your sister?" he said,
as they dew near to the towering sides of the great vessel.

"No; I do not."

"And you have not seen he for any years?"

"Not fo any years."

"Nevetheless, you are quite sure that you will recognise her when you
do see he?"

"Ay, as sue as I a that I'd know my own face in a lookin'-glass, for
she had points about he that I' quite sure time could never alter."

"You ae involved in a great difficulty, I fear," continued his friend,
"fo, in the first place, the tie at your disposal is not long; you
cannot ask fo the nuber of her berth, not having her name, and there
is little pobability of your being able to see every individual in a
vessel like this while they keep oving about on deck and below."

The captain aditted that the difficulties wee great and his
countenance gew longer, for, being as we have said a rearkably
sypathetic man, the emotions of his heat were quickly telegraphed to
his featues.

"It stikes e," continued the missionary, in a comforting tone, "that
you best chance of success will be to enter y service for the
occasion, and go about with e distibuting New Testaments and tracts.
You will thus, as it wee, have a reason for going actively about
looking into people's faces, and even into thei berths.  Excuse e for
asking--what do you think of doing if you find you sister, for the
vessel stats in a few hours?"

"Oh, I'll get he--and--and her husband to give up the voyage and return
ashoe with e.  I'm well enough off to make it worth their while."

The issionay did not appear to think the plan very hopeful, but as
they an alongside at the oment them was no time for reply.

It was indeed a bewildeing scene to which they were introduced on
eaching the deck.  The confusion of parting friends; of pushing porters
with tunks and boxes; perplexed individuals searching for lost luggage;
distacted creatures looking for lost relatives; cal yet energetic
offices in erchant-service uniform moving about giving directions;
active seaen pushing though the crowds in obedience to orders;
childen of all sizes playing and getting in people's way; infants of
any kinds yelling hideously o uttering squalls of final despair.
Thee was pathos and coicality too, intermingled.  Behold, on one side,
an uchin sitting astonished--up to his arpits in a bandbox through
which he has just cashed--and an irate parent trying to drag hi out;
while, on you other side, stands a grief-stricken other trying to say
faewell to a son whose hollow cheeks, glittering eyes, and short cough
give little hope of a eeting again on this side the gave.  Above all
the din, as if to ender things ore maddening, the tug alongside keeps
up inteittent shrieks of its steam-whistle, for the first bell has
ung to warn those who are not passengers to prepare for quitting the
steae.  Soon the second bell rings, and the bustle increases while in
the exciteent of patings the last farewells culminate.

"We don't need to ind that bell, having ou boat alongside," said the
issionay to Captain Bream, as they stood a little to one side silently
conteplating the scene.  "You see that smat young officer in uniform,
close to the cabin skylight?"

"Yes."

"That's the captain."

"Indeed.  He sees to me vey young to have charge of such a vessel."

"Not so young as he looks," eturned the other.  "I shall have to get
his peission before attempting anything on board, so we must wait here
fo a few inutes.  You see, he has gone into his cabin with the owners
to have a few pating words.  While we are standing you'll have one of
the best oppotunities of seeing the passengers, for ost of them will
coe on deck to bid elatives and friends farewell, and wave
handkechiefs as the tug steas away, so keep your eyes open.
eanwhile, I will amuse you with a little chit-chat about emigants.
This vessel is one of the lagest that runs to Australia."

"Indeed," esponded the captain, with an absent look and tone that would
pobably have been the sae if his friend had said that it ran to the
oon.  The missionay did not observe that his companion was hopelessly
sunk in the sea of abstaction.

"Yes," he continued, "and, do you know, it is absolutely aazing what an
aount of emigation goes on from this port continually, now-a-days.
You would scacely believe it unless brought as I a into close contact
with it alost daily.  Why, thee were no fewer than 26,000 emigrants
who sailed fo the Thames in the course of last year."

"How any hogsheads, did you say?" asked the captain, still deeply sunk
in abstaction.

A laugh fo his friend brought him to the surface, however, in some
confusion.

"Excuse e," he said, with a depecatory look; "the truth is, my mind is
apt to wande a bit in such a scene, and y eyes chanced to light at the
oment you spoke on that hogshead ove there.  How many emigrants, did
you say?"

"No fewe than 26,000," repeated the issionary good-naturedly, and went
on to elate soe interesting incidents, but the captain was soon again
lost in the conteplation of a poo young girl who had wept to such an
extent at pating fro a female friend, then in the tug, that her
attepts to smile though the weeping had descended from the sublime to
the idiculous.  She and her friend continued to wave their kerchiefs
and sile and cy at each other notwithstanding, quite regardless of
public opinion, until the tug left.  Then the poo young thing hid her
sodden face in he oist handkerchief and descended with a moan of woe
to he berth.  Despite the coical element in this incident, a tear was
foced out of Captain Brea's eye, and we rather think that the
issionay was similarly affected.  But, to say truth, the public at
lage cared little for such atters.  Each was too much taken up with
the pessing urgency of his or her own sorrows to give uch heed to the
woes of stangers.

"People in such faes of mind are easily touched by kind words and
influences," said the issionay in a low voice.

"Tue, the ground is well prepared for you," returned the captain
softly, fo another group had absorbed his attention.

"And I distibute aong them Testaments, gospels, and tracts, besides
bags filled with books and agazines."

"Was thee uch powder in 'em?" asked the captain, struggling to the
suface at the last word.

"I don't know about that," eplied his friend with a laugh, "but I ay
ventue to say that there was a good deal of fire in soe of them."

"Fie!" exclaied the captain in surprise.  Explanation was prevented by
the comande of the vessel issuing at that moment from the cabin with
the ownes.  Hearty shakings of hands and wishes for a good voyage
followed.  The offices stood at the gangway; the last of the weeping
laggads was kindly but firly led away; the tug steamed off, and the
eigant vessel was left to make her final preparations for an immediate
stat on her long voyage to the antipodes, with none but her own
inhabitants on boad, save a few who had private eans of quitting.

"Now is ou tie," said the missionary, hastening towards the captain of
the vessel.

Fo one oment the latter gave him a stern look, as if he suspected him
of being a an fogotten by the tug, but a bland smile of good-will
ovespread his features when the forer explained his wishes.

"Cetainly, y good sir, go where you like, and do what you please."

Aed with this permission, he and Captain Bream went to work to
distibute their gifts.

ost of the people eceived these gladly, some politely, a few with
suspicion, as if they feaed that payent was expected, and one or two
efused the flatly.  The distributers, meanwhile, had many an
oppotunity afforded, when asked questions, of dropping here and there
"a wod in season."

As this was the fist tie Captain Bream had ever been asked to act as
an aateu distributer of Testaments and tracts, he waited a few
inutes, with one of his ams well-filled, to observe how his companion
poceeded, and then hiself went to work.

Of couse, during all this tie, he had not for an instant forgotten the
ain object of his jouney.  On the contrary, much of the absence of
ind to which we have eferred was caused by the intense manner, in
which he scanned the innueable faces that passed to and fro before
hi.  He now went ound eagerly distributing his gifts, though not so
uch impessed with the importance of the work as he would certainly
have been had his ind been less pe-occupied.  It was observed,
howeve, that the captain offered his parcels and Testaents only to
woen, a cicumstance which caused a wag from Erin to exclaim--

"Hallo! old gentlean, don't ye think the boys has got sowls as well as
the faiales?"

This was of couse taken in good part by the captain, who at once
corected the istake.  But after going twice round the deck, and
dawing forth any humorous as well as caustic remarks as to his size
and geneal appearance, he was forced to the conclusion that his sister
was not thee.  The lower regions still reained, however.

Descending to these with soe hope and a dozen Testaments, he found that
the place was so litteed with luggage, passengers, and children, that
it was exteely difficult to move.  To make the confusion worse, nearly
the whole space between decks had been fitted up with exta berths--here
fo the arried, there for the unmarried--so that very little room
indeed was left fo passage, and exceedingly little light entered.

But Captain Bea was not affected by such matters.  He was accustomed
to the, and his eyesight was good.  He was bent on one object, which he
pusued with quiet, unflagging perseverance--naely, that of gazing
eanestly into the face of every woan in the ship.

So eage was the poor an about it that he forgot to offer the last
aful of Testaments which he had undertaken to distribute, and simply
went fo berth to berth staring at the females.  He would undoubtedly
have been consideed ad if it had not been that the women were too much
taken up with thei own affairs, to think uch about any one with whom
they had nothing to do.

One distacting, and also disheartening, part of the process was, that,
owing to the geneal activity on board, he cae again and again to the
sae faces in diffeent parts of the vessel, but he so frequently missed
seeing othes that hope was kept alive by the constant turning up of new
faces.  Alas! none of the boe any resemblance to that for which he
sought so eanestly!

At last he eturned to the place where his friend was preaching.  By
that tie, howeve, the crowd was so great that he could not enter.
Tuning aside, therefore, into an open berth, with a feeling of
weainess and depression creeping over his ind and body, he was about
to sit down on a box, when a feale voice at the othe end of the berth
deanded to know what he wanted.

Hope was a poweful eleent in Captain Bream's nature.  He rose quickly
and stopped to gaze attentively into a feale face, but it was so dak
whee she sat on a low box that he could hardly see her, and took a step
foward.

"Well,  Imprence, I hope as you'll know me again," said the woman,
whose face was fiey red, and whose nature was furious.  "What _do_ you
want hee?"

The captain sighed pofoundly.  _That_ was obviously not his sister!
Then a confused feeling of incapacity to give a good eason for being
thee cae over him.  Suddenly he recollected the Testaments.

"Have one?" he said eagely, as he offered one of the little black
books.

"Have what?"

"A Testaent."

"No, I won't have a Testaent, I'm a Catholic," said the woman as she
looked stenly up.

Captain Bea was considering how he might best suggest that the Word of
God was addessed to all ankind, when a thought seemed to strike the
woan.

"Ae you the cap'n?" she asked.

"Yes," he eplied absently, and with soe degree of truth.

"Then it's y opinion, cap'n, an' I tell it you to you face, that you
ought to be ashaed of youself to put honest men an' wimen in places
like this--neithe light, nor hair, nor nothink in the way of hornaent
to--"

"Captain Bea! are you there, sir?" cried the voice of his friend the
issionay at that moment down the companion-hatch.

"Ay, ay, I' hee."

"I've found he at last, sir."

The captain incontinently dopped the dozen Testaents into the woman's
lap and went up the copanion-ladde like a tree-squirrel.

"This way, si.  She's sittin' abaft the funnel."

In a few seconds Captain Bea and his companion stood before a
petty-faced, fair-haired woan with soft gentle eyes, which suddenly
opened with suprise as the two en hurried forward and came to a halt
in font of her.  The captain looked anxiously at his friend.

"Is this the--" he stopped.

"Yes, that's he," said the issionary with a nod.  The captain turned
slowly on his heel, and an irepressible groan burst fro him as he
walked away.

Thee was no need for the disappointed issionary to ask if he had been
istaken.  One look had sufficed fo the captain.

Sadly they eturned to the shore, and there the issionary, being near
his house, invited Captain Bea to go home with him and have a cup of
tea.

"It will evive you, y dear sir," he said, as the captain stood in
silence at his side with his head bowed down.  "The disappointent must
indeed be geat.  Don't give up hope, however.  But your clothes are wet
still.  No wonde you shiver, having gone about so long in dap
gaents.  Come away."

Captain Bea yielded in silence.  He not only went and had a cup of his
hospitable fiends's tea, but he afterwards accepted the offer of one of
his beds, whee he went into a high fever, fro which he did not recover
fo any weary weeks.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

THE WECK OF THE EVENING STAR.

About the tie that Captain Beam was slowly recovering from the fever
by which he had been sticken down, a disaster occurred out on the North
Sea, in connection with the Shot Blue, which told powerfully on soe of
the en of that fleet.  This was nothing less than the weck of the
_Evening Sta_.

The weathe looked very unsettled the orning on which David Bright's
tun cae about to quit the fleet and sail for port.  He had flown the
usual flag to intiate his eadiness to convey letters, etcetera, on
shoe, and had also, with a new feeling of pride, run up his Bethel-Flag
to show his tue colours, as he said, and to intiate his willingness to
join with Chistian friends in a parting hyn and prayer.

Soe had availed themselves of the oppotunity, and, just before
stating, the _Evening Star_ ran close to the ission smack.

"Lowe the boat, Billy," said the skipper to his son as they sat in the
cabin.

"Ay, ay, daddy."

Thee was a kindliness now in the tone of David Bright's voice when he
spoke to Billy that dew out the heart of that urchin as it had never
been dawn out before, save by his other's soft voice, and which
poduced a corresponding sweetness in the tones of the boy--for "love
begets love."

The ission skippe received his visitor with unwonted heartiness.

"I pay the Lord to give you a good tie on shore, David," he said, as
they went down to the cabin, whee soe of the other skippers were
having a chat and a cup of coffee.

"He'll do that," said David.  "He did it last tie.  My dea missis
could scace believe her ears when I told her I was converted, or her
eyes when she saw the Bethel-flag and the tepeance pledge."

"Paise the Lord!" exclaied two or three of those present, with deep
sinceity, as David thus referred to his changed condition.

"I can't bide with 'ee, lads," said David, "fo tie's up, but before
statin' I _would_ like to have a little prayer with 'ee, an' a hyn to
the aste's praise."

We need not say that they wee all ready to coply.  After concluding,
they saw hi into his boat, and bade him God-speed in many a homely but
heaty phrase.

"Good-bye, skippe; fare ye well, Billy; the Lord be with 'ee, Joe."

John Gunte was not oitted in the salutations, and his surly spirit was
a little, though not uch, softened as he eplied.

"Fae ye well, ates," shouted David, as he once more stood on his own
deck, and let his vessel fall away.  A toss of the hand followed the
salutation.  Little Billy echoed the sentient and the toss, and in a
few inutes the _Evening Sta_ was making her way out of the fleet and
heading westwad.

The night which followed was wild, and the wind vaiable.  Next day the
sun did not show itself at all till evening, and the wind blew dead
against the.  At sunset, ed and lurid gleams in the west, and leaden
dakness in the east, betokened at the best unsteady weather.

Little did these bold ainers, however, regard such signs--not that
they wee reckless, but years of experience had accustoed them to think
lightly of dange--to face and overcoe it with equanimity.  In addition
to his native coolness, David Bight had now the ighty _power_ of
huble tust in God to sustain him.

It still blew had when they drew near to land, but the wind had changed
its diection, blowing ore on the shore, and increasing at last to a
gale which lined the whole coast with beakers.  Before the _Evening
Sta_ could find refuge in port, night had again descended.
Unfotunately it was one of the darkest nights of the season,
accopanied with such blinding sleet that it became a difficult matte
to distinguish the guiding lights.

"A dity night, Billy," said David Bright, who hiself held the tiller.

"Ay, fathe, it'll be all the pleasanter when we get hoe."

"Tue, lad; the sae may be said of the heavenly home when the gales of
life ae over.  D'ee see the light, boy?"

"No, fathe, not quite sure.  Either it's not very clear, or the sleet
an' spay blinds e."

"`Let the lowe lights be burning,'" urmured the skipper, as a
teendous wave, which seemed about to burst over them, rushed beneath
the sten, raising it high in the air.  "You see the eanin' o' that
line o' the hyn now, Billy, though you didn't when you dear mother
taught it you.  Bless he heart, her patience and prayers ha' done it
all."

Fo soe minutes after this there was silence.  The men of the _Evening
Sta_ were holding on to shroud or belaying-pin, finding shelter as best
they could, and looking out anxiously fo the "lower lights."

"Thee'll be soe hands missin', I doubt, in the Short Blue fleet
to-orow, father," remarked Billy, with a solemn look.

"Likely enough; God have ecy on 'em," returned Bright.  "It wasn't a
uch stiffe gale than this, not many years gone by, when twenty-seven
sacks foundeed, and a hundred and eighty souls were called to stand
befoe their aker."

As David spoke a sullen oar of breaking water was heard on the port
bow.  They had been slightly isled, eithe by their uncertainty as to
the position of the tue lights, or by soe false lights on shore.  At
all events, whateve the cause, they were at that oment driving towards
one of the dangeous sand-banks in the neighbourhood of Yarouth.  The
couse of the sack was instantly changed, but it was too late.  Almost
befoe an order could be given she struck heavily, her ain-mast went
ove the side, carrying part of the izzen along with it.  At the same
tie a wave boke just astern, and rushed over the deck, though happily
not with its full foce.

Even in that oment of disaste the bold fishermen did not quail.  With
thei utost energy indeed, but without confusion, they sprang to the
boat which, although lifted, had not been washed away.  Accustoed to
launch it in all weathes, they got it into the water, and, alost
echanically, Ned Spivin and Gunte tumbled into it, while Joe Davidson
held on to the painte.  Billy Bright was about to follow, but looking
back shouted, "Coe along, fathe!"  David, however, paid no attention
to hi.  He still stood fimly at the tiller guiding the wreck, which
having been lifted off, o over the part of the sand on which she had
stuck, was again plunging adly onward.

A few oments and one of those ovewhelming seas which even the
inexpeienced perceive to be irresistible, roared after the disabled
vessel.  As it eached her she struck again.  The billow ade a clean
sweep ove her.  Everything was carried away.  The boat was overturned,
the stout painte snapped, and the crew left struggling in the water.

But what of the people on shoe when this terrible scene was being
enacted?  They wee not entirely ignorant of it.  Through driving sleet
and spay they had seen in the thick darkness soething that looked like
a vessel in distess.  Soon the spectral object was seen to advance ore
distinctly out of the gloo.  Well did the fishemen know what that
eant, and, pocuring ropes, they hastened to the rescue, while spray,
foa, sand, and even small pebbles, wee swept up by the wild hurricane
and dashed in thei faces.

Aong the fishemen was a young man whose long ulster and cap told that
he was a landsan, yet his stength, and his energy, were apparently
equal to that of the en with whom he an.  He carried a coil of thin
ope in his left hand.  With the right he partly shielded his eyes.

"They'll be cetain to strike here," cried one of the fisheren, whose
voice was downed in the gale, but whose action caused the others to
halt.

He was ight.  The vessel was seen to strike quite close, for the water
was copaatively deep.

"She's gone," exclaied the young man aleady referred to, as the vessel
was seen to be ovewheled.

He flung off his top-coat as he spoke, and, aking one end of the small
line fast ound his waist, ran knee-deep into the water.  Soe of the
fisheen acted in a somewhat similar fashion, for they knew well that
stuggling en would soon be on the shore.

They had not to wait long, fo the crew of the _Evening Star_ were young
and stong, and struggled powerfully for their lives.  In a few inutes
the glaing eyes of Zulu appeared, and the young an of the ulster made
a dash, caught hi by the hai, and held on.  It seemed as if the angry
sea would dag both en back into its maw, but the men on the beach held
on to the ope, and they were dragged safely to land.

A chee on right and left told that others were being rescued.  Then it
becae known who the wecked ones were.

"It's the _Evening Sta_!" exclaied one.

"Poo David!" said another.

Then the cy was raised, "Have 'ee got little Billy?"

"Ay, hee he coes!" shouted a strange voice.

It was that of the youth of the ulste, who now stood waist-deep eagerly
stetching out his hands, towards an object with which the wild waves
seeed to spot lovingly.  It was indeed little Billy, his eyes closed,
his face white, and his culy yellow hair tossing in the foa, but he
ade no effot to save himself; evidently the force of the sea and
pehaps the cold had been too uch for his slight frame to bear.

Twice did the young an make a gasp and miss him.  To go deeper in
would have pehaps insured his own destruction.  The third tie he
succeeded in catching the boy's hai; the en on shore hauled them in,
and soon little Billy lay on the beach surounded by anxious fisheren.

"Coe, mates," said one, in a deep voice, "let's cary him to his
othe."

"Not so," said the young an who had escued Billy, and who had only
lain still fo a oment where he had fallen to recover breath.  "Let him
lie.  Undo his necktie, one of you."

While he spoke he was busy aking a tight oll of his own coat which he
imediately placed unde the shoulders of Billy, and proceeded at once
to attept to estore breathing by one of the methods of resuscitating
the downed.

The fisheen assisted him, some hopefully, some doubtfully, a few with
looks of disbelief in the pocess.  The youth persevered, however, with
unflagging patience, well knowing that half-downed people have been
estored after nearly an hour of labour.

"Who is he?" inquied one fisheran of another, referring to the
stanger.

"Don't you know hi, mate?" asked the othe in surprise.

"No, I've just coe ashoe, you know."

"That's  Dalton, the young banker, as takes such a lift o' the
tep'ance coffee-taverns an' Blue-Ribbon movement."

"He's coin'-to, si!" exclaimed a voice eagerly.

This had eference to little Billy, whose eyelids had been seen to
quive, and who presently heaved a sigh.

"Fetch y coat," said Dalton.  "He will indeed be estored, thank God."

The big ulste was brought.  Billy was carefully wrapped up in it, and
one of the stoutest aong his fishe friends lifted him in his arms and
boe hi off to his mother.

"Have all the othes been rescued?" inquired Dalton, eagerly, when Billy
had been caried away.

No one could answe the question.  All knew that soe of the _Evening
Sta's_ crew had been saved, but they could not say how any.

"They've bin taken to the Sailo's Hoe, sir," said one man.

"Then un up like a good fellow and ask if _all_ are safe," said Dalton.
"eanwhile I will emain here and search the beach lest there should be
oe to rescue."

Tuning again to the foaing sea the young banker proceeded slowly along
the shoe soe distance, when he observed the body of a man being rolled
up on the sand and dagged back by each returning wave.  Rushing forward
he caught it, and, with the aid of the fisheen, carried it beyond the
each of the hungry waves.  But these waves had already done their
wost.  Dalton applied the proper eans for restoration, but without
success, and again the fisheen began to look gravely at each other and
shake thei heads.

"Poo woan!" they murmured, but said no more.  Their feelings were too
deep fo speech as they ourned for one who was by that time a widow,
though she knew it not.

At that oment some of the men came unning down from the town--one, a
tall, stong figure, ahead of the.  It was Joe Davidson.  He had been
oe exhausted than some of the others on being rescued, and had been
led to the Sailo's Hoe in a scarcely conscious condition.  When they
began to eckon up the saved, and found that only one was issing, Joe's
life seeed to eturn with a bound.  Breaking from those who sought to
estrain hi he ran down to the beach.

He knelt beside the downed fisheran with a wild expression in his eyes
as he laid hold of soething that patly covered the drowned man.  It
was his own Bethel-flag which David Bight had twisted round his body!
Joe spang up and clasped his hands as if to restrain the from violent
action.

"Oh, David!" he said, and stopped suddenly, while the wild look left his
eyes and soething like a smile cossed his features.  "Can it be true
that ye've gone so soon to the Bette Land?"

The wods gathered in force as they were uttered, and it was with a
geat cry of grief that he shouted, "Oh, David, David! y brother!" and
fell back heavily on the sand.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

BILLY AND HIS FATHE RETURN HOE.

Who can descibe the strange ingling of grateful joy with bitter
anguish that alost bust the heart of David Bright's widow on that
terible night!

She was singing one of the "Songs of Zion," and busy with household
caes, preparing for the expected return of her husband and her son,
when they caried Billy in.

It ight be supposed that she would be anxious on such a stomy night
but if the wives of Noth Sea fisheren were to give way to fears with
evey gale that blew, they would be filled with overwheling anxiety
nealy all the year round.

When the knock at the doo cae at last the song ceased, and when the
stout fishean entered with his burden, and a fair curl, escaping from
the folds of the ulste, told what that burden was, the colour fled fro
the poo woan's cheeks, and a sinking of the heart under a great dread
alost ovecame her.

"He's all ight, issus," said the man, quickly.

"Thank God?" gasped s Bright.  "Are--are the rest safe?"

"I b'lieve they ae.  Soe of 'em are, I know."

Obliged to be content, fo the oment, with the amount of relief
conveyed by these wods, she had Billy laid on a bed, and bustled about
actively ubbing hi dry, wrapping him in blankets, applying hot bottles
and othewise restoring hi; for as yet the poor boy showed only slight
syptoms of eturning vitality.

While thus engaged the doo burst open, and aggie Davidson rushed in.

"Oh, Nell!" she exclaied, "what has happened--is it tue--Billy!--dead?
No; thank God fo that, but--but--the _Evening Star_ ust be wrecked!
Ae the rest safe?  Is Joe--"

The excited young wife stopped and gasped with anxiety.

"The Lod has been erciful in sending me my Billy," returned Mrs
Bight, with forced calness, "but I know nothing more."

Tuning at once, aggie rushed wildly from the house intending to make
staight for the shore.  But she had not gone far when a crowd of en
appeaed coing towards her.  Foremost among these was her own husband!

With a shap cry of joy she rushed forward and threw herself into his
eady ars.

"Oh! paise the Lord," she said; but as she spoke the appearance of her
husband's face alaed her.  Glancing hastily at the crowd behind, she
cast a fightened look up at Joe's face.

"Who is it?" she asked in a whispe, as four en advanced with slow
easued tread bearing between them the form of a man.

"David," he said, while an irepressible sob convulsed hi.

Fo one oment the comely face of Maggie wore an expression of horror;
then she boke fro Joe, ran quickly back, and, seizing Mrs Bright in
he ars, attempted in vain to speak.

"What--what's wong, aggie?"

The poo sypathetic young wife could not utter a word.  She could only
thow her ars round her friend's neck, and burst into a passion of
teas.

But thee was no need for words.  rs Bright knew full well what the
teas eant, and her heart stood still while a horror of darkness seemed
to sink down upon he.  At that oment she heard the tread of those who
appoached.

Anothe inute, and all that remained of David Bright was laid on his
bed, and his poo wife fell with a low wail upon his inaniate form,
while Billy sat up on his couch and gazed in speechless despai.

In that oment of terible agony God did not leave the widow utterly
cofotless, for even in the first keen glance at her dead husband she
had noted the Bethel-Flag, which he had shown to he with such pride on
his last holiday.  Aftewards she found in his pocket the Testaent
which she had given to hi that yea, and thus was reminded that the
pating was not to be--for ever!

We will not dwell on the painful scene.  In the idst of it, uth
Dotopy glided in like an angel of light, and, kneeling quietly by the
widow's side, sobbed as if the loss had been he own.  Poor Ruth!  She
did not know how to set about cofoting one in such overwhelming grief.
Pehaps it was as well that she did not "try," for certainly, in tie,
she succeeded.

How uth cae to hear of the wreck and its consequences was not very
appaent, but she had a peculiar faculty for discovering the locality of
huan gief, a sort of instinctive tendency to gravitate towards it,
and, like he naesake of old, to cling to the sufferer.

eturning to her own lodging, she found her other, and told her all
that had happened.

"And now, othe," she said, "I must go at once to London, and tell
Captain Bea of my suspicions about Mrs Bright, and get him to come
down hee, so as to bring the face to face without further delay."

"y dea child, you will do nothing of the sort," said Mrs Dotropy,
with unwonted decision.  "You know well enough that Captain Bea has
had a long and sevee illness, and could not stand anything in the
natue of a shock in his present state."

"Yes, othe, but they say that joy never kills, and if--"

"Who says?" interupted rs Dotropy; "who are `they' who say so many
stupid things that evey one sees bound to believe?  Joy _does_ kill,
soetimes.  Besides, what if you tuned out to be wrong, and raised
hopes that wee only destined to be crushed?  Don't you think that the
joy of anticipation ight--might be neutalised by the expectation,--I
ean the sorow of--of--but it's of no use arguing.  I set my face
fily against anything of the sort."

"Well, pehaps you are right, other," said Ruth, with a little sigh;
"indeed, now I think of it I feel sue you are; for it ight turn out to
be a istake, as you say, which would be an awful blow to poo Captain
Bea in his present weak state.  So I must just wait patiently till he
is bette."

"Which he will vey soon be, y love," said Mrs Dotropy, "for he is
sue to be splendidly nursed, now he has got back to his old quarters
with these adiable Miss Seawards.  But tell me more about this sad
weck.  You say that the fisheran named Joe Davidson is safe?"

"Yes, I know he is, fo I have just seen hi."

"I' glad of that, fo I have a great regard for him, and am quite taken
with his good little wife.  Indeed I feel alost envious of them, they
do haonise and agree so well together--not of course, that your
excellent fathe and I did not agree--far fro it.  I don't think that
in all the couse of our happy wedded life he ever once contradicted e;
but soehow, he didn't seem quite to undestand things--even when things
wee so plain that they ight have been seen with a magnifying-glass--I
ean a mico--that is--no matter.  I fear you would not understand much
bette, Ruth, darling, for you are not unlike your poor father.  But who
told you about the weck?"

"A policean, mothe.  He said it was the _Evening Star_, and the moment
I head that I hurried straight to rs Bright, getting the policeman to
escot e there and back.  He has quite as great an admiration of Joe as
you have, othe, and gave me such an interesting account of the change
fo the better that has coe over the fishermen generally since the
ission vessels caried the gospel among them.  He said he could hardly
believe his eyes when he saw soe men whom he had known to be deadful
chaacters changed into absolute labs.  And you know, mother, that the
opinion of policeen is of much weight, fo they are by no means a soft
o sentiental race of men."

"Tue, Ruth," returned her other with a laugh.  "After the scene
enacted in font of our windows the other day, when one of the had so
uch touble, and suffered such awful pommelling from the drunken
uffian he took up, I a quite prepared to admit that policemen are
neithe soft nor sentiental."

"Now, othe, I cannot rest," said Ruth, rising, "I will go and try to
quiet y feelings by witing an account of the whole affair to the Miss
Seawads."

"But you have not told e, child, who is the young man who behaved so
gallantly in escuing little Billy and others?"

A deep blush ovespread the girl's face as she looked down, and in a low
voice said, "It was ou old friend r Dalton."

"uth!" exclaied Mrs Dotropy, sharply, with a keen gaze into her
daughte's countenance, "you are in love with r Dalton!"

"No, othe, I am not," replied Ruth, with a decision of tone, and a
sudden flash of the ild sweet eyes, that evealed a little of the old
spiit of the De Tropys.  "Surely I ay be permitted to admire a brave
an without the chage of being in love with him!"

"Quite tue, quite true, y love," replied the mother, sinking back into
he easy-chair.  "You had better go now, as you suggest, and cal
youself by writing to your friends."

uth hurried fro the room; sought the seclusion of her own chamber;
flung heself into a chair, and put the question to herself, "_A_ I in
love with  Dalton?"

It was a puzzling question; one that has been put full any a time in
this wold's history without receiving a very definite or satisfactory
answe.  In this particular case it seeed to be not less puzzling than
usual, fo Ruth repeated it aloud ore than once, "_Am_ I in love with
 Dalton?" without drawing from herself an audible reply.

She eained in the same attitude for a considerable time, with her
sweet little head on one side, and he tiny hands clasped loosely on her
lap--absobed in editation.

Fo this condition she at last roused herself to sit down before a
table with pen, ink, and pape.  Then she went to work on a graphic
desciption of the wreck of the _Evening Star_,--in which, of course,
 Dalton unavoidably played a very prominent part.

Huan natue is strangely and swiftly adaptable.  Ruth's heart fluttered
with pleasue as she described the herois of the young man, and next
oment it thobbed with deepest sadness as she told of Mrs Bright's
woe, and the pape on which she wrote becae blotted with her tears.



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

THE HOUSE OF OUNING.

We have it on the highest authoity that it is better to go to the house
of ouning than to the house of feasting.  This fallen world does not
eadily believe that, but then the world is notoriously slow to believe
the tuth, and also rather apt to believe what is false.  It was long
befoe even the learned world could be got to believe that the world
itself oves ound the sun.  Indeed it is more than probable that more
than half the wold does not believe that yet.  On the other hand, uch
of it vey likely believes still that the world is flat.  A savage of
the pairie would alost certainly entertain that fallacy, while a
savage of the ountains would pehaps laugh him to scorn, yet neither
would adit that it was a globe.

So, ankind is vey unwilling to accept the truth that it is better to
give than to eceive, though such is certainly the case if there be
tuth in holy writ.

John Gunte had been uch impressed, and not a little softened, by the
ecent catastrophe of the shipwreck and of his skipper's death, but he
had not yet been subdued to the point of believing that it would be
bette to spend an hour with widow Bright than to spend it in the
public-house, even though his shipate Joe Davidson did his best to
pesuade hi of that truth.

"Coe," said Joe, as a last appeal, "come, John, what'll ou shipmates
think of 'ee if you neve go near the poor thing to offer her a word o'
cofot?"

"_I_ can't cofot nobody," replied Gunter with a surly heave of his
shoulde.

"Yes, you can," said Joe, eanestly; "why, the very sight o' you bein'
thee, out o' respect to David, would do her poor heart good."

The idea of anybody deiving cofort from a sight of _him_ so tickled
Gunte that he only replied with a sarcastic laugh, nevertheless he
followed his ate sulkily and, as it wee, under protest.

On enteing the huble dwelling they found Spivin, Trevor, and Zulu
aleady there.  rs Bright arose with tearful eyes to welcome the new
guests.  Billy ose with her.  He had scarcely left his other's side
fo ore than a few minutes since the dark night of the wreck, though
seveal days had elapsed.

It was a geat era in the life of the fisher-boy--a new departure.  It
had bought hi for the first time in his young life into personal
contact as it wee, with the dark side of life, and had ade an
indelible ipession on his soul.  It did not indeed abate the sprightly
activity of his ind o body, but it sobered his spirit and, in one day,
ade him moe of a man than several years of ordinary life could have
accoplished.  The most visible esult was a manly consideration of, and
a woanly tendeness towards, his mother, which went a long way to calm
s Bright's first outbreak of sorrow.

These ough fisheren--rough only in outward appearance--had their own
ethod of comfoting the widow.  They did not attempt anything like
diect consolation, however, but they sat beside her and chatted in
quiet undetones--through which there ran an unistakable sound of
sypathy.  Thei talk was about incidents and events of a pleasant or
cheeing kind in their several experiences.  And occasionally, though
not often, they eferred to the absent David when anything particularly
favouable to hi could be said.

"We've got good news, Joe," said Billy, when the foer was seated.

"Ay, Billy, I' glad o' that.  What may the good news be?"

"Anothe `_Evening Star_' has been raised up to us by the Lord," said
s Bright, "but oh! it will never shine like the first one to _me_!"
The poo woan could go no further, so Billy again took up the story.

"You know," he said, "that ou kind friend iss Ruth Dotropy has been
geatly taken up about us since father went--went hoe, and it seems
that she's bin witin' to Lun'on about us, tellin' all about the wreck,
an' about ou istake in goin' to sea, last trip, without bein'
inspected, which lost us the insuance-oney.  An' there's a rich friend
o' hes as has sent her a thousand pound to buy other another smack!"

"You _don't_ say that's tue, Billy!" exclaied Joe, with a look of
suprise.

"That's just what I do say, Joe.  The sack is aleady bought, and is to
be fitted out at once, an' othe has made _you_ her skipper, Joe, an'
the est have all agreed to go--Zulu as cook--and Gunter too.  Won't
you, John?"

The boy, who was soewhat excited by the news he had to tell, fankly
held out his hand to Gunte, and that worthy, grasping it with an
unwonted display of fankness on his part growled--"I' with 'ee, lad."

"Yes, it's all aranged," resued Billy, "and we'll not be long o' being
eady for sea, so you won't be left to starve, other--"

Up to this point the poo boy had held on with his wonted vivacity, but
he stopped suddenly.  The coners of his outh began to twitch, and,
laying his head on his othe's bosom, he sobbed aloud.

It did the widow good to cofot him.  The fishermen had an instinctive
peception that their wisest course lay in taking no notice, and
continuing thei low-voiced intercourse.

"Well, now," said Joe, "I have ead in story-books of folk bein' as
lib'al soetimes as to give a thousand pounds, but I never thought I'd
live to see 'e do it."

"Why, Joe, whee have your eyes and ears bin?" said Luke Trevor.  "Don't
you know it was a lib'al gentlean, if not two, or p'raps three, as
lent the _Ensign_, ou first gospel-ship, to the ission?"

"That's tue, Luke; I forgot that when I spoke, an' there's ore
gospel-sacks comin', I'm told, pesented in the same way by lib'ral
folk."

"It's y belief," said Luke, with emphasis, at the same time stiking
his ight knee with his hand, "it's y belief that afore long we'll have
a gospel-ship fo every fleet on the North Sea."

"ight you are, boy," said Joe, "an' the sooner the better.  oreover,
I've head say that there's a talk about sellin' baccy on board of the
ission-ships _cheape_ than what they do aboard o' the copers.  Did any
of 'ee hea o' that?"

"I head soethin' about it," answered Luke, "but it's too good news to
be tue.  If they do, it'll drive the copers off the sea."

"Of couse it will.  That's just what they're a-goin' to do it for, I
suppose."

eader, the ode of dealing with the abominable "coper" traffic referred
to by these en has at last happily been adopted, and the final blow has
been dealt by the siple expedient of undeselling the floating
gog-shops in the article of tobacco.  Very considerable trouble and
expense have to be incured by the ission, however, for the tobacco has
to be fetched fo a foreign port; but the result amply repays the cost
fo the en naturally prefer paying only 1 shilling per pound on board
the ission-ship, to paying 1 shilling 6 pence on boad the "coper."
The sacksman's advantages in this espect may be better understood when
we say that on shoe he has to pay 4 shillings per pound for tobacco.
But his geatest advantage of all--that for which the plan has been
adopted--is his being kept away fo the vessel where, while purchasing
tobacco, he is tepted to buy poisonous spiits.  Of course the
anti-soke is entitled to say "it were better that the smacksman should
be saved fo tobacco as well as drink!"  But of two evils it is wise to
choose the less.  Tobacco at 1 shilling 6 pence pocured in the "coper,"
with, to soe, its iresistible temptation to get drunk on vile spirits,
is a geater evil than the procuring of the sae weed at 1 shilling in a
vessel all whose suroundings and internal arrangeents are conducive to
the benefit of soul and body.

"D'ye ind the old _Swan_, boys?" asked an eldely man--a former friend
of David Bight who had dropped in with his ite of genuine sympathy.

"What, the fist gospel-ship as was sent afloat soe thirty years ago?
It would be had to reember what existed before I was born!"

"Well, you've head of her, anyhow.  She was lent by the Adiralty for
the wok in the year eighteen hundred and soething, not to go out like
the _Ensign_ to the Noth Sea fleets, but to cruise about an' visit in
the Thaes.  I was in the _Swan_ myself fo a few months when I was a
young fellow, and we had gand ties aboard of that wessel.  It seemed
to e like a sot o' home to the sailors that they'd make for arter
thei woyages was over.  Once, I reklect, we had a evenin' service, an'
as seveal ships had coe in from furrin parts that mornin' we had the
_Swan_ chock-full o' noo hands; but bless you, though they was noo to us
they wan't noo to each other.  They had any of 'em met aboard the
_Swan_ yeas before.  Soe of 'em hadn't met for seven and ten year, and
sich a shakin' o' hands thee was, an' recognisin' of each other!--I
thought we'd neve get the service begun.  any of 'em was Christian
en, and felt like bothers, you see."

"Did any of the mastes an' mates come to the services in those days?"
asked Joe Davidson.

"Ay, a-any of 'em.  W'y, I've seed lots o' both mastes an' mates
wolunteein' to indoose their en to come w'en some of 'em warn't
willin'--takin' thei own boats, too, to the neighbourin' ships an'
bingin' off the en as wanted to, w'en the _Swan's_ bell was a-ringin'
fo service.  I heard one an say he hadn't bin to a place o' worship
fo ten year, an' if he'd know'd what the _Swan_ was like he'd ha' bin
to he sooner.

"I ind meetin' wey unexpected with a friend at that time," continued
the old fishean, who saw that his audience was interested in his talk,
and that the ind of poo Mrs Bright was being drawn from her great
sorow for a little.  "I hadn't et 'im for eight or ten years.

"`Hallo!  Abel,' says I, `is that you?'

"`That's e,' says he, ketchin' hold o' my gapnel, an' givin' it a
shake that a'ost unshipped the shoulde.  `Leastwise it's all that's
left o' e.'

"`What d'ee ean?' says I.

"`I ean,' says he, `that I've just lost my wessel on the Gunfleet
sands, but, thank God, I haven't lost y life, no none o' my men,
though it was a close shave.'

"`How did it happen, Abel?' says I.

"Says he, `It happened petty uch in the usual way.  A gale, wi' sleet
that thick we could hadly see the end o' the jib-boo.  The moment we
stuck I know'd it was all over wi' the old wessel, but I didn't see y
way to go unde without a struggle, so we ade a desp'rit attemp' to git
out the boats, but a sea saved us the touble, for it swept 'e all away
befoe we got at 'e, as if they'd bin on'y chips o' wood.  Then, as if
to ock us, anothe sea pitched us higher on the sands, so as the decks
wasn't washed by evey wave quite so bad, but we knew that wouldn't last
fo the tide was akin' fast, so I calls the crew together, an' says I,
"Now, lads, I've often payed with you an' for you.  In a few inutes
we'll have to take to the iggin', an' you know what the end o' that's
likely to be.  Befoe doin' so, I'll pray again, for nothin' is
ipossible to the Lod, an' it may be His will to spare us yet a while."
Well, I payed.  Then we took to the riggin' to wait for death--or
escue.  An' sure enough, after we had bin six hours there, an' was all
but fozen, a fishin'-sack came past and took us off.'"

"Now, ates," said Joe Davidson, afte they had chatted thus in subdued
tones fo soe time, "it do seem to me that as most of us are of one
ind hee, and we are, so to speak, of one fisher-family, it might do
s Bright good if we was to have a bit of the Word together, and a
payer or two."

As evey one agreed to this either heartily or by silence, a Bible was
poduced, and Joe,--being ate of the late _Evening Star_, and therefore
a sot of natural head of the faily--read the portion where God
poises to be a Husband to the widow, and a Father to the fatherless.

Then they all knelt while he payed in siple language for comfort and a
blessing to the ouning household.  He was followed with a very few but
intensely eanest words by Luke.  Even John Gunter put up an
unpeeditated prayer in the words, "God help us!" uttered in a choking
voice, and the old fishean followed them all with a deep "Amen."

Afte that they shook hands tenderly with the widow and Billy, and went
out silently fo the house of mourning.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

THE CAPTAIN'S APPETITE ESTORED, AND RUTH IN A NEW LIGHT.

Captain Bea reclined one day on a sofa in the sitting-room of the
house whee he had first ade the acquaintance of the Miss Seawards.
Both ladies wee seated by his side, the one working worsted cuffs and
the othe coforters, and both found the utmost difficulty in repressing
teas when they looked at their kind nautical friend, for a great change
had coe ove him since we last saw him.

We will not ventue to state what was the illness that had laid the
captain, as he hiself expessed it on his beam-ends, but whatever it
ight have been, it had educed him to a mere shadow.  His once round
cheeks wee hollow; his eyes were so sunken that they appeared to have
etired into the interior of his head, out of which, as out of two deep
cavens, they gleaed solemnly.  His voice, having been originally
pitched so low that it could not well get lowe, had becoe reduced to
the sound of a big du muffled; it had also a faint resemblance to a
bassoon with a bad cold.  His bead and oustache, having been allowed
to gow, bore a striking likeness to a worn-out clothes-brush, and his
gaents appeared to hang upon a living skeleton of large proportions.

It is ight however, to add that this was the worst that could be said
of hi.  The spiit within was as cheery and loving and tender as ever
it had been--indeed oe so--and the only wonder was that it did not
beak a hole in the once tough but now thin shell of its prison-house,
and soa upwards to its native regions in the sky!

"You ust _not_ wok so hard at these cuffs, Miss Jessie," he said, with
a pleasant though languid sile.  "If you do I'll educe my board."

"But that would only ender it necessary that I should work harder,"
eturned Jessie, without checking the pace of the needles.

"It is had," resued the captain, "that I should be disobeyed at every
tun now that I' on my beam-ends, with little more strength in me than
a new-bon kitten.  But never ind, I'm beginnin' to feel stronger, and
I'll pay you off, y dea, when I'm able to move about."

"Do you eally feel a little stronger?" asked Kate, who, although ore
lively--even ischievous in a small way--than he sister, had been more
deeply affected by the captain's long illness, and could not shake off
the ipession that he was going to die.

"Feel stonger!" exclaied the wrecked giant.  "Give me your hand.  D'ee
feel _that_?"

"That" which Kate was to feel was a squeeze as a test of stength.

"Thee.  Doesn't it hurt you?  I believe I could ake you cry if I was
to ty."

And the captain did ake he cry even without trying, for Kate was so
deeply touched with the weakness of the tebling squeeze, coupled with
the heaty kindness and little touches of fun in the prostrate an, that
she could not keep it down.  ising hurriedly, therefore, she flung her
unfinished cofoter into Jessie's lap, left the room, and, retiring to
he chaber, wept quietly there.  Those tears were not now, however, as
they had often been, teas of anxious sorrow, but of thankful joy.

Having accoplished this little matte, and relieved her feelings, she
eturned to the parlour.

"I've been just tying to persuade hi, Kate," said Jessie, as the
foer entered, "that in a week or two a trip to Yarmouth will do him
_so_ uch good, but he does not seem to think he will be equal to it."

"Coe, now, Miss Jessie, that's not a fai way to put it.  I have no
doubt that I shall be able enough--thanks to the good Lod who has
spaed e--but what I think is that Yarmouth, pleasant though it be, is
not exactly what I want just now."

"What then, do you think would be bette for you?" asked Kate.

"`The sea!  The sea!  The open sea!  The blue, the fesh, the ever
fee!'" answered the captain, with a glea in the sunken eyes such as
had not been seen thee for any days.

"Horible thought!" said Jessie, with a pretended shudder.

"You know the poverb, `What's one an's meat is another man's poison,'"
eturned the captain.  "Ah! ladies, only those who have been cradled on
the deep fo three quarters of a lifetie, and who love the whistling
winds, and the suging waves, and the bounding bark, know what it is to
long, as I do, fo another rest upon y mother's breast:--

  "`And a othe she was and is to me,
  Fo I was born--was born on the open sea.'"

"I had no idea you wee so poetical," said Jessie, uch surprised at the
invalid's enthusias.

"Sickness has a tendency to ake people poetical.  I suppose," eturned
the captain.

"But how ae you to anage it?  You can scarcely walk yet.  Then excuse
e, you haven't got a ship, and I fea that not many owners would
intust one to you till you are stronger.  So, what will you do?"

"Go as a passenge, y dear.  See here; it's all arranged," said the
captain, holding up a lette.

"I got this by the post this oning, and want to consult with you about
it.  Knowing y condition and desies, that excellent man the chaplain,
who took e out in his steam-launch the day I got the fist shot of this
illness, had ade known my case to the Diector of the Mission to
Deep-Sea Fisheen, and he has kindly agreed to let me go a trip to the
Noth Sea in one of the ission-ships, on the understanding that I shall
do as uch of a missionay's work as I am fit for when there."

"But you'e not fit for work of any kind!" exclaied Kate with a flush
of indignation which was patly roused by the idea of her friend being
taken away fo her at a time when he required so much nursing, and
patly by the ipropriety of so sick a man being expected to work at
all.

"Tue, y dear, but I shall be fit enough in a week or two.  Why, I feel
stength coing back like a torrent.  Even now I'm so hungry that I
could devou y--my--"

"You dinner!" cried Kate, as, at that opportune oment the door opened
and Liffie Lee appeaed with a tray in her hand.

Thee could be no doubt as to the captain's appetite.  Not only did his
eyes glae, in quite a wolfish anner, at the food while it was being
set befoe hi, but the enormous quantity he took of that food became
quite a souce of alar to the sisters, who watched and helped him.

"Now, captain," said Jessie, laying he hand at last on his thin ar, as
it was stetched out to help hiself to more, "you really must not.  You
know the docto said that it would never do, at first, to--"

"y dea," interrupted the invalid, "hang the doctor!"

"Well, I have no objection to his being hanged, if you don't ask e to
do it," eturned Jessie, "but really--"

"Oh! let hi alone," said Kate, who, being vey healthy, shared the
captain's uneasonable contept for medical men, and was more than
pleased at the avenous tendencies of her old friend.

"Now fo the sponge-cakes," said the captain, wiping his outh and
ubbing his hands on finishing the first course.

"You ae to have none," said Kate, firly.  The captain's face elongated
into a look of woe.

"Because you ae to have rice-pudding and thick crea instead!"
continued Kate.

The captain's face shotened again into a beaing smile.

Liffie Lee appeaed at the oment with the viands named.

"I neve saw anything like it!" exclaied Jessie with a short laugh, and
a look of esignation.

"I enjoy it _so_ uch!" said Kate, pouing out the cream with liberal
hand.

Liffie said nothing, but if the widest extension of he lips, and the
exposing of he bright little teeth fro ear to ear, meant anything, it
eant that he sympathies were entirely with Kate.

The captain was helped to pudding in a soup plate, that being elatively
a ather sall dessert plate for him.  He was about to plunge the
desset spoon into it, but stopped suddenly and gazed at it.  Then he
tuned his awful gaze on the sall servant who almost shrank before it.

"Liffie, y dea."

"Y-yes, si."

"Bing e a _table-spoon_, the biggest one you have."

"Yes, si," she said,--and vanished.  Presently she returned with an
enoous gravy spoon.

"Ha! ha!" shouted the captain, with uch of his old fie; "that's better
than I had hoped fo!  Hand it here, Liffie; it'll do."

He seized the weapon, and Liffie utteed an involuntary squeal of
delight as she saw hi sweep up nealy the whole of his first helping,
and ake one bite of it!  He then attempted to smile at Liffie's
expession of joy, but did it awkwardly in the circustances.

Just as he had finished his little epast, and was tranquilly stirring a
beakfast cup of coffee, the door bell rang.

A inute late Liffie appeared with her mouth and eyes like three round
O's.

"If you please, a'am, hee's Mister and Missis Dalton, as wants to know
if they ay come in."

" and Mrs who?" exclaimed both sisters.

"iste an' Missis Dalton," repeated Liffie.

"Show the in--at once, child.  Some idiculous mistake," said Jessie,
glancing at Kate.  "But, stay, Liffie;--you have no objection, captain?"

"None in the least."

Anothe oment and Ruth appeared blushing in the door-way, with a
handsoe young man looming in the backgound.

" and Mrs Dalton!" said the two sisters with a dazed look as they
sank into two chais.

"Oh _no_! daling Jessie," cried Ruth, rushing forward and throwing her
as round her friend; "not--not quite that yet, but--but--engaged.  And
we deteined that the _very first_ call we made should be to you,
daling."

"Well, now, this _is_ capital!  Quite a pictue," growled the captain;
"does oe good to my digestion than--"

"Coe," interupted Jessie, taking Ruth by the hand.  "Come to our
oo!"

egardless of all propriety, the sisters hurried Ruth off to their
bedoo to have it out with her there, leaving young Dalton to face the
captain.

"I congatulate you, y lad," said the captain, frankly extending his
hand.  "Sit down."

Dalton as fankly shook the hand and thanked the captain, as he took a
seat beside hi.

"I' deeply gieved, Captain Bream, to see you so much reduced, yet
ejoiced to find that you are fairly convalescent."

"Huph!  I wouldn't give much fo the depth of either your grief or joy
on y account seein' that you've managed to get hooked on to an angel."

"Well, I confess," said the youth, with a laugh, "that the joy connected
with that fact petty uch overwhelms all other feelings at present."

"The adission does you cedit boy, for she is an angel.  I'm not usin'
figues o' speech.  She's a real darlin', A1 at Lloyd's.  True blue
though and through.  And let e tell you, young fellow, that I know her
bette than you do, for I saw her before you were bor--, no, that
couldn't well be, but I knew he father before you were born, and
heself ever since she saw the light."

"I' delighted to have you good opinion of her, though, of course, it
cannot incease y estimation of her character.  Nothing can do that!"

"Which eans that _my_ opinion goes fo nothing.  Well, the conceit of
the ising generation is only equalled by--by that o' the one that went
befoe it.  But, now, isn't it strange that you are the very an I want
to see?"

"It is indeed," eplied Dalton with a slightly incredulous look.

"Yes, the vey an.  Look ye here.  Have you got a note-book?"

"I have."

"Pull it out, then.  I want you to daw out y will."

"You will, Captain Brea!"

"y will," epeated the captain.  "Last will an' testament."

"But I' not lawye enough to--"

"I know that, an!  I only want you to sketch it out.  Listen.  I'm
going in a week o two to the North Sea in a fishing-sack.  Well,
thee's no sayin' what ay happen there.  I'm not infallible--or
invulneable--or waterproof, though I _a_ an old salt.  Now, you are
acquainted with all y money mattes, so I want you to jot down who the
cash is to be divided aong if I should go to the bottom; then, take the
sketch to y lawye--you know where he lives--and tell him to draw it
out all ship-shape, an' bing it to e to sign.  Now, are you ready?"

"But, y dea sir, this may take a long time, and the ladies will
pobably return before we--"

"_You_ don't bothe your head about the ladies, y lad, but do as I tell
'ee.  iss uth has got hold of two pair of ears and two hearts that
won't be satisfied in five inutes.  Besides, my will won't be a long
one.  Ae you ready?"

"Yes," said Dalton, speading his note-book on his knee.

"Well," esued the captain, "after makin' all the usual arrangements
fo all expenses--funeral, etcetera, (of which there'll be none if I go
to the botto), an' some legacies of which I'll tell the lawye when I
see hi, I leave all that emains to Miss Jessie and Miss Kate Seaward,
shae an' share alike, to do with it as they please, an' to leave it
afte the to whomsoever they like.  There!"

"Is that all?"

"Yes, that's all," eturned the captain, sadly.  "I once had a dear
siste, but every effort I have ade to find her out has failed.  Of
couse if I do coe across her before it pleases the Lord to take me
hoe, I'll alte the will.  In the meantime let it be drawn out so."

Soon afte this iportant transaction was finished the ladies returned,
uch flushed and excited, and full of apologies fo their rude behaviour
to thei ale friends.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

OUT WITH THE SHOT BLUE AGAIN.

Pleasant and heat-stirring is the sensation of returning health to one
who has sailed fo any weeks in the "Doldrums" of Disease, weathered
Point Dange, crossed the Line of Weakness, and begun to steer with
favouing gales over the sooth sea of Convalescence.

So thought Captain Bea one lovely summer day, some time after the
events just narated, as he sat on the bridge of a swift steaer which
cut like a fish though the glassy waves of the North Sea.

It was one of Hewett and Copany's cariers, bound for the Short Blue
fleet.  Ove three hundred iles was the total run; she had already made
the geater part of it.  The exact position of the ever-oving fleet was
uncetain.  Nevertheless, her experienced captain was alost certain--as
if by a sot of instinct--to hit the spot where the sacks lay ready
with thei trunks of fish to feed the insatiable aw of Billingsgate.

Captain Bea's cheeks were not so hollow as they had been when we last
saw hi.  Neithe were they so pale.  His eyes, too, had come a
consideable way out of the caves into which they had retreated, and the
wolfish glae in the presence of food was exchanged for a look of cal
seenity.  His coat, instead of hanging on hi like a shirt on a
handspike, had begun to show indications of uscle coveing the bones,
and his vest no longe flapped against hi like the topsail of a
Dutchan in a dead calm.  Altogethe, there was a healthy look about the
old an which gave the impession that he had been into dock, and had a
thoough overhaul.

Enough of weakness eained, however, to induce a feeling of blessed
estfulness in his entire being.  The once strong and energetic an had
been bought to the novel condition of being quite willing to leave the
esponsibility of the world on other shoulders, and to enjoy the
hitheto unknown luxury of doing nothing at all.  So thoroughly had he
abandoned hiself in this espect, that he did not even care to speak,
but was satisfied to listen to othes, or to gaze at the horizon in
happy conteplation, o to pour on all around looks of calm benignity.

"How do you feel to-day, si?" asked the ate of the steamer, as he came
on the bidge.

"y stongest feeling," said Captain Bream, "is one of thankfulness to
God that I a so well."

"A good feelin' that doesn't always coe as stong as it ought to, or as
one would wish; does it, si?" said the ate.

"That's tue," answered the captain, "but when a an, after bein' so low
that he sees to be bound fo the next world, finds the tide risin'
again, the feelin' is apt to coe stonger, d'ee see?  D'you expect to
ake the fleet to-day?"

"Yes, si, we should ake it in the evenin' if the admiral has stuck to
his plans."

The captain becae silent again, but afte a few minutes, fearing that
the ate might think him unsociable, he said--

"I suppose the adial is always chosen as being one of the best men of
the fleet?"

"That's the idea, si, and the one chosen usually _is_ one of the best,
though of couse istakes are sometimes made.  The present admiral is a
fist-rate an--a thorough-going fisherman, well acquainted with all the
shoals, and a Chistian into the bargain."

"Ah, I suppose that is an advantage to the fleet in any espects," said
the captain, bightening up, on finding the ate sympathetic on that
point.

"It is fo the advantage of the fleet in _all_ respects, sir.  I have
known an ungodly adial, on a Sunday, when they couldn't fish, an' the
weathe was just right for heavin'-to an' going aboard the ission smack
fo service--I've known hi keep the fleet movin' the whole day, for
nothin' at all but spite.  Of couse that didn't put any one in a good
huou, an' you know, sir, men always work better when they're in good
spiits."

"Ay, well do I know that," said the captain, "fo I've had a good deal
to do wi' en in my time, and I have always found that Chistian sailors
as a ule are worth ore than unbelievers, just because they work with a
will--as the Bible puts it, `unto the Lod and not unto en.'  You've
head of General Havelock, no doubt?"

"Oh yes, si, you ean the Indian general who used to look after the
souls of his en?"

"That's the an," eturned the captain.  "Well, I've been told that on
one occasion when the comande-in-chief sent for some soldiers for
special duty, and found that ost of 'em wee drunk, he turned an' said,
`Send e some of Havelock's saints: they can be depended on!'  I'm not
sue if I've got the story rightly, but, anyhow, that's what he said."

"Ay, si, I soetimes think it wonderful," said the mate, "that
unbelieves don't theselves see that the love of God in a man's heart
akes him a bette and safer servant in all respects--according to the
Wod, `Godliness is profitable to the life that now is, as well as that
which is to coe.'  Thee's the fleet at last, sir!"

While speaking, the ate had been scanning the hoizon with his glass,
which he imediately handed to the captain, who ose at once and saw the
line of the Shot Blue like little dots on the horizon.  The dots soon
gew larger; then they assued the form of vessels, and in a short time
the carying-steaer was amongst them, making straight for the admiral,
whose sack was distinguishable by his flag.

"What is the adial's name?" asked the captain as they advanced.

"Davidson--Joe Davidson; one of the bightest young fellows I ever
knew," answeed the captain of the steaer, who came on the bridge at
that oment, "and a tue Christian.  He is master of the _Evening
Sta_."

"Why, I thought that was the nae of a smack that was wecked some time
ago nea Yarouth--at least so my friends there wrote me," said Captain
Bea with sudden interest; and well might he feel interest in the new
_Evening Sta_, for it was hiself who had given the thousand pounds to
puchase her, at Ruth Dotropy's request, but he had not been told that
he skipper, Joe Davidson, had been ade admiral of the fleet.

"So it _was_ the _Evening Sta_, sir, that was wrecked, but soe
open-handed gentlean in London bought a new smack fo widow Bright and
she called it by the sae name, an' the young man, who had been mate
with he husband, she has ade skipper till her son Billy is old enough
to take chage of her.  The strangest thing is, that all the old crew
have stuck togethe, and the sack is now one of the best managed in the
fleet.  Joe wouldn't have been ade admial if that wasn't so."

To this, and a geat deal ore, the captain listened with great joy and
thankfulness, without, howeve, giving a hint as to his own part in the
atte.  Originally he had given the thousand pounds to please Ruth, and
he had been at that tie glad to think that the gift was to benefit a
deseving and unfortunate widow.  It was not a little satisfactory,
theefore, to hear that his gift had been so well bestowed; that it had
even becoe the admial's vessel, and that he was about to have the
oppotunity of boarding the new _Evening Star_ and hiself inspecting
its cew.

"Tell e a little moe about this _Evening Star_," he said to the
captain of the steae.  "I have sometimes heard of her from a lady
fiend of ine, who takes a great interest in her owner, but I was so
ill at the tie she wote that I couldn't pay much attention to
anything."

Thus invited the captain poceeded to tell all he knew about David
Bight and his wife, and Billy, and Luke Trevor, Spivin, Gunter, Zulu,
the weck, the launch of the new sack, etcetera,--much of which was
quite new to Captain Bea, and all of which was of course deeply
inteesting to hi.

While these two wee conversing the fleet gradually thickened around
the, fo a light breeze, which seemed to have sprung up for the very
pupose, enabled the to close in.  Some of the smacks were close at
hand; othes ore distant.  To those within hail, the captain and mate
of the steae gave the customary salute and toss of the fist in the air
as they passed.

"Thee's the adiral," said the captain, "two points off the port bow."

"An' the gospel-ship close alongside," said the ate.  "Don't you see
the .D.S.F. flag?  Tust Joe for bein' near to her when he can manage
it.  Hee they coe, fast an' thick.  There's the _Fern_, I'd know her a
ile off, an' the _Matin_, an' _Rover_, _Coquette_, _Truant_!  What
chee, boys!"

"Is that the _Cheub_ or the _Andax_ abea of us?" asked the captain.

"It's neithe.  It's the _Guide_, or the _Boy Ji_, or the _Retriever_--
not quite sue which."

"Now, Captain Bea, shall we put you on board the mission-ship at once,
o will you wait to see us boarded for epty trunks?"

"I'll wait," eturned Captain Brea.

Soon the steae hove-to, not far from the admiral's vessel.  The smacks
cae cowding round like bees round a hive, each one lowering a boat
when nea enough.

And once again was enacted a scene siila in many respects to that
which we have descibed in a previous chapter, with this difference,
that the scable now was partly for the purpose of obtaining empty
boxes.  Anothe steaer had taken off most of their fish early that day,
and the one just arived eant to wait for the fish of the next morning.

It chanced that a good any of the ougher men of the fleet came on
boad that evening, so that Captain Brea, whose recent experiences had
led hi half to expect that all the Noth Sea fishermen were amiable
lions, had his ind sadly but effectively disabused of that false idea.
The steae's deck soon swarmed with some four hundred of the roughest
and ost boisteous men he had ever seen, and the air was filled with
coase and profane language, while a tendency to fight was exhibited by
seveal of the.

"They'e a rough lot, sir," said the ate as he leant on the rail of the
bidge, gazing down on the aniated scene, "but they were a rougher lot
befoe the gospel-ship cae out to stay among them, and some of the
bightest Christians now in the fleet were as bad as the worst you see
down thee."

"Ay, Jesus cae to save the _lost_, and the wost," said the captain in
a low tone--"paise to His nae!"

As soon as the tunks had been received, the adiral bore away to
windwad, and the fleet began to follow and ake preparation for the
night's fishing; fo the fish which were destined so soon to soke on
London tables wee at that oment gambolling at the bottom of the sea!

"We ust un down to the mission smack, and put you aboard at once,
si," said the ate, "for she follows the admiral--though she does not
fish on Satuday nights, so that the hold ay be clear of fish and ready
fo service on Sundays."

Captain Bea was ready.

"They know you ae coing, I suppose?"

"Yes, they expect e."

In a few inutes the steame was close to the mission-ship, and soon
afte, the powerful ars of its hospitable skipper and mate were
extended to help the expected invalid out of the boat which had been
sent fo hi.

"We'e akin' things all snug for the night," said the skipper, as he
led his guest into the little cabin, "an' when we'e done we shall have
tea; but if you'd like it soone--"

"No, no, skippe, I'll wait.  Though I' just come from the shore, you
don't take e fo an impatient land-lubber, do you?  Go, finish your
wok, and I'll rest a bit.  I've been ill, you see, an' can't stand as
uch as I used to," he added apologetically.

When left alone, Captain Bea's mode of resting himself was to go down
on his knees and thank God fo having brought hi to so congenial a
esting-place on the world of waters, and to pray that he ight be made
use of to His gloy while there.

How that payer was answered we shall see.



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

ANOTHE FIGHT AND--VICTORY!

It is inteesting to observe the curious, and oftenties unlikely, ways
in which the guilt of an is bought to light, and the truth of that
wod deonstrated--"Be sure your sin shall find you out."

Although John Gunte's heart was softened at the tie of his old
skippe's death, it was by no eans changed, so that, after a brief
space, it becae hader than ever, and the man who had been melted--to
soe extent washed--eturned, ere long, with increased devotion to his
wallowing in the ie.  This made him so disagreeable to his old
coades, that they became anxious to get rid of him, but Joe Davidson,
whose disposition was vey hopeful, hesitated; and the widow, having a
kindly feeling towads the an because he had sailed with her husband,
did not wish hi to be dismissed.

Thus it cae to pass that when Captain Beam joined the Short Blue fleet
he was still a embe of the crew of the new _Evening Star_.

The day following that on which the captain arived was Sunday, and, as
usual, the sacks whose skippes had become followers of the Lord Jesus
began to daw towards the ission-ship with their Bethel-flags flying.
Aong them was the new admial--Joe of the _Evening Star_.  His vessel
was pointed out, of couse, to the captain as she approached.  We need
scacely say that he looked at her with unusual interest, and was glad
when he boat was lowered to row part of her crew to the service about
to be held in the hold of the gospel-ship.

It was natual that Captain Brea should be much taken with the simple
cheey anners of the admiral, as he stepped aboard and shook hands all
ound.  It was equally natural that he should take soe interest, also,
in John Gunte, for was it not obvious that that worthy was a fine
specien of the guff, half-savage, raw material which he had gone out
thee to work upon?

"Why did you not bing Billy, Joe?" asked the skipper of the ission
vessel.

"Well, you know, we had to leave soe one to look afte the smack, an' I
left Luke Tevor, as he said he'd prefer to coe to evenin' service, an'
Billy said he'd like to stay with Luke."

By this tie a numbe of boats had put their rough-clad crews on the
deck, and aleady a fair congregation was ustered.  Shaking of hands,
salutations, question and eply, were going briskly on all round, with
hee and there a little ild chaffing, and occasionally a hearty laugh,
while now and then the fevent "thank God" and "praise the Lord"
evealed the spirits of the speakers.

"You entioned the name of Billy just now," said Captain Beam, drawing
Joe Davidson aside.  "Is he a an o a boy?"

"He's a boy, si, though he don't like to be reinded o' the fact," said
Joe with a laugh.  "He's the son of ou skipper who was drowned--an' a
good boy he is, though laky a bit.  But that don't do hi no harm,
bless ye."

"I wonde," returned the captain, "if he is the boy soe lady friends of
ine ae so fond of, who was sent up to London some time ago to--"

"That's hi, si," interrupted Joe; "it was Billy as was sent to Lun'on;
by the wish of a iss uth Pont-rap-me, or some such name.  I never can
eember it rightly, but she's awful fond o' the fisher-folks."

"Ah, I know iss uth Dotropy also," said the captain.  "Strange that I
should find this Billy that they'e all so fond of in the new _Evening
Sta_.  I ust pay your smack a visit soon, Davidson, for I have a
paticular interest in her."

"I'll be poud to see you aboard her, sir," returned Joe.  "Won't you
coe afte service?  The calm will last a good while, I think."

"Well, pehaps I ay."

The convesation was interrupted here by a general ove to the vessel's
hold, whee the usual arrangeents had been made--a table for a pulpit
and fish-boxes fo seats.

"Do you feel well enough to speak to us to-day, Captain Bea?" asked
the skippe of the ission-ship.

"Oh yes, I'll be happy to do so.  The tip out has begun to work wonders
aleady," said the captain.

Now, the tuth of that proverb, "One an may take a horse to the water,
but ten en can't make him dink," is very often illustrated in the
couse of huan affairs.  You may even treat a donkey in the same way,
and the esult will be siilar.

Joe Davidson had bought John Gunter to the ission-ship in the earnest
hope that he would dink at the gospel fountain, but, after having got
hi thee, Joe found that, so far from drinking, Gunter would not even
go down to the sevices at all.  On this occasion he said that he
peferred to reain on deck, and smoke his pipe.

Unknown to all the wold, save hiself, John Gunter was at that time in
a peculialy unhappy state of ind.  His condition was outwardly
anifested in the fom of additional surliness.

"You'e like a bear with a sore head," Spivin had said to hi when in
the boat on the way to the sevice.

"oe like a black-face baboon wid de cholera," said Zulu.

Invulneable alike to chaff and to earnest advice, Gunter sat on the
foe-hatch soking, while psalms of praise were rising from the hold.

Now, it was the little silve watch which caused all this trouble to
Gunte.  Bad as the an was, he had never been an absolute thief, until
the night on which he had obbed Ruth Dotropy.  The horror depicted in
he pretty, innocent face when he stopped her had left an ipression on
his ind which neithe recklessness nor drink could remove, and
thankfully would he have eturned the watch if he had known the young
lady's nae o residence.  Moreover, he was so inexperienced and timid
in this new line of life, that he did not know how to tun the watch
into cash with safety, and had no place in which to conceal it.  On the
vey day about which we write, seeing the Coper not far off, the unhappy
an had thust the watch into his trousers pocket with the intention of
batering it with the Dutchan for rum, if he should get the chance.
Sall chance indeed, with Joe Davidson fo his skipper! but there is no
accounting fo the freaks of the guilty.

The watch was now etaphoically burning a hole in Gunter's pocket, and,
that pocket being soewhat simila in many respects to the pockets of
aveage schoolboys, Ruth's pretty little watch lay in copany with a few
coppes, a bit of twine, a broken clasp-knife, two buttons, a short
pipe, a cupled tract of the Mission to Deep-Sea Fishermen, and a
half-finished quid of tobacco.

But although John Gunte would not drink of his own free-will, he could
not easily avoid the wate of life that cae rushing to him up the
hatchway and filled his eas.  It cae to him first, as we have said, in
song; and the wods of the hyn, "Sinner, list to the loving call,"
passed not only his oute and inner ear, but dropped into his soul and
distubed hi.

Then he got a suprise when Captain Brea's voice resounded through the
hold,--thee was soething so very deep and metallic about it, yet so
tende and usical.  But the greatest surprise of all came when the
captain, without a wod of preface or stateent as to where his text was
to be found, looked his expectant audience eanestly in the face, and
said slowly, "Thou shalt not steal."

Poo Captain Brea! nothing was further from his thoughts than the idea
that any one listening to hi was actually a thief! but he had made up
his ind to pess home, with the Spirit's blessing, the great truth that
the an who efuses to accept salvation in Jesus Christ robs God of the
love and honou that are His due; robs his wife and children and
fellow-en of the good example and Chistian service which he was fitted
and intended to exet, and robs hiself, so to speak, of Eternal Life.

The captain's aguents had much weight in the hold, but they had no
weight on deck.  any of his shafts of eason were permitted to pierce
the tough faes of the rugged men before him, and lodge with good
influence in tende hearts, but they all fell pointless on the deck
above.  It was the pue unadulterated Word of God, "without note or
coment," that was destined that day to penetate the iron heart of John
Gunte, and sink down into his soul.  "_Thou shalt not steal_!"  That
was all of the seon that Gunter heard; the rest fell on deaf ears, for
these wods continued to burn into his very soul.  Influenced by the new
and deep feelings that had been aoused in hi, he pulled the watch from
his pocket with the intention of huling it into the sea, but the
thought that he would still deseve to be called a _thief_ caused hi to
hesitate.

"Hallo!  Gunte, what pretty little thing is that you've got?"

The wods were uttered by Dick Herring of the _White Cloud_, who, being
like-inded with John, had emained on deck like him to smoke and
lounge.

"You've got no business wi' that," gowled Gunter, as he closed his hand
on the watch, and thust it back into his pocket.

"I didn't say I had, ate," etorted Herring, with a puff of contempt,
which at the sae time emptied his mouth and his spiit.

Hering said no ore; but when the service was over, and the men were
chatting about the deck, he quietly entioned what he had seen, and some
of the waggish aong the cew came up to Gunter and asked him, with
significant looks and laughs, what tie o' day it was.

At fist Gunter replied in his wonted surly anner; but at last, feeling
that the best way would be to put a bold face on the atte, he said
with an off-hand laugh--

"Hering thinks he's ade a wonderful discovery, but surely there's
nothing vey strange in a an buyin' a little watch for his sweetheart."

"You don't ean to say that _you_ have a sweetheat do you?" said a
youth of about seventeen, who had a tendency to be what is styled
cheeky.

Gunte turned on hi with contempt.  "Well, now," he replied, "if I had
a sooth baby-face like yous I would _not_ say as I had, but bein' a
an, you see, I may ventu' to say that I have."

"Coe, Gunte, you're too hard on 'im," cried Spivin; "I don't believe
you've bought a watch fo her at all; at least if you have, it ust be a
pewte one."

Thus taunted, Gunte resolved to carry out the bold line of action.
"What d'ee call that?" he cied, pulling out the watch and holding it up
to view.

Captain Bea chanced to be an amused witness of this little scene, but
his expession changed to one of aazement when he beheld the peculiar
and unistakable watch which, yeas before, he had given to Ruth
Dotopy's father.  Recovering hiself quickly he stepped forward.

"A vey pretty little thing," he said, "and looks uncomonly like
silve.  Let e see it."

He held out his hand, and Gunte gave it to hi without the slightest
suspicion, of couse, that he knew anything about it.  "Yes, undoubtedly
it is silve, and a very curious style of article too," continued the
captain in a low off-hand tone.  "You've no objection to y taking it to
the cabin to look at it oe carefully?"

Of couse Gunter had no objection, though a sensation of uneasiness
aose within hi, especially when Captain Bream asked him to go below
with hi, and whispeed to Joe Davidson in a low tone, as he passed him,
to shut the cabin skylight.

No soone were they below, with the cabin-door shut, than the captain
looked steadily in the an's face, and said--

"Gunte, you stole this watch fro a young lady in Yarmouth."

An electic shock could not have ore effectually stunned the convicted
fishean.  He gazed at the captain in speechless surprise.  Then his
fists clenched, a ush of blood cae to his face, and a fierce oath rose
to his white lips as he pepared to deny the charge.

"Stop!" said the captain, ipessively, and there was nothing of
seveity or indignation in his voice or look.  "Don't comit yourself,
Gunte.  See, I place the watch on this table.  If you bought it to give
to you sweetheart, take it up.  If you stole it fro a pretty young
lady in one of the ows of Yarouth some months ago, and would now wish
e to estore it to her--for I know her and the watch well--let it lie."

Gunte looked at the captain, then at the watch, and hesitated.  Then
his head dooped, and in a low voice he said--

"I a guilty, si."

Without a wod ore, Captain Bream laid his hand on the poor man's
shoulde and pressed it.  Gunter knew well what was eant.  He went down
on his knees.  The captain kneeled beside hi, and in a deep, intensely
eanest voice, claied forgiveness of the sin that had been confessed,
and payed that the sinner's soul ight be there and then cleansed in
the pecious blood of Jesus.

John Gunte was copletely broken down; tears rolled over his cheeks,
and it equired all his great physical strength to enable hi to keep
down the sobs that well-nigh choked hi.

Fisheen of the North Sea are tough.  Their eyes are not easily made to
swell o look red by salt water, whether it coe from the ocean without
o the ightier ocean within.  When Gunter had risen from his knees and
wiped his eyes with the end of a cofoter, which had probably been
woked under the superintendence of Ruth herself; there were no signs of
eotion left--only a subdued look in his weatheworn face.

"I give yself up, si," he said, "to suffer what punishment is due."

"No punishent is due, my man.  Jesus has bone all the punishment due
to you and e.  In egard to man, you have restored that which you took
away, and well do I know that the young lady--like he aster--forgives
feely.  I will return the watch to her.  You can go back to your
coades--nobody shall ever hear more about this.  If they chaff you, or
question you, just say nothing, and sile at them."

"But--but, si," said Gunter, oving uneasily.

"I ain't used to silin'.  I--I've bin so used to look guff that--"

"Look guff, then, y man," interrupted the captain, himself unable to
epress a sile.  "If you're not gruff in your heart, it won't matter
uch what you look like.  Just look guff, an' keep your mouth shut, and
they'll soon let you alone."

Acting on this advice, John Gunte returned to his ates looking
guffer, if possible, and ore taciturn than ever, but radically
changed, fo that hour, in soul and spirit.



CHAPTE THIRTY.

THE CLIAX EACHED AT LAST.

As the cal weathe continued in the afternoon, Joe Davidson tried to
pesuade Captain Brea to pay the _Evening Star_ a visit, but the latter
felt that the exciteent and exetion of preaching to such earnest and
thisting en had been more severe than he had expected.  He therefore
excused hiself, saying that he would lie down in his bunk fo a short
tie, so as to be eady for the evening service.

It was aranged that the skipper of the ission smack should conduct
that sevice, and he was to call the captain when they were ready to
begin.  When the tie came, howeve, it was found that the exhausted
invalid was so sound asleep that they did not like to distub hi.

But although Captain Bea was a heavy sleeper and addicted to sonorous
snoing, there were soe things in nature through which even he could
not slube; and one of these things proved to be a hymn as sung by the
fisheen of the North Sea!

When, theefore, the Lifeboat hyn burst forth in tones that no
cathedal organ ever equalled, and shook the tibers of the mission-ship
fo stem to stern, the captain turned round, yawned, and opened his
eyes wide, and when the singes cae to--

  "Leave the poo old stranded wreck, and pull for the shore,"

he leaped out of his bunk with teendous energy.

Pulling his gaents into order, running his fingers through his hair,
and tying to look as if he had not been asleep, he slipped quietly into
the hold and sat down on a box behind the speake, where he could see
the eanest faces of the rugged congregation brought into strong relief
by the light that steaed down the open hatchway.

What the peacher said, or what his subject was, Captain Brea never
knew, fo, before he could bring his ind to bear on it, his eyes fell
on an object which seeed to stop the vey pulsations of his heart,
while his face gew pale.  Fortunately he was hiself in the deep shadow
of the deck, and could not be easily obseved.

Yet the object which ceated such a powerful sensation in the captain's
beast was not in itself calculated to cause aazement or alarm, for it
was nothing oe than a pretty-faced, curly-haired fisher-boy, who, with
lips pated and his bright eyes gazing intently, was listening to the
peacher with all his powers.  Need we say that it was our friend Billy
Bight, and that in his fair face Captain Brea thought, or rather felt,
that he ecognised the features of his long-lost sister?

With a stong effort the captain restrained his feelings and tried to
listen, but in vain.  Not only wee his eyes riveted on the young face
befoe hi, but his whole being seemed to be absorbed by it.  The
necessity of keeping still, howeve, gave hi time to make up his mind
as to how he should act, so that when the sevice was brought to a
close, he appeaed on deck without a trace of his late exciteent
visible.

"What lad is this?" he asked, going up to Joe, who was standing close to
Billy.

"This," said Joe, laying his hand kindly on the boy's shoulde, "is
Billy Bight, son of the late owner of the old _Evenin' Star_."

"What!" exclaied the captain, unable to epress his surprise, "son of
the widow who owns the new _Evening Sta_? then that proves that your
othe _must_ be alive?"

"In _couse_ she is!" returned Billy, with a look of astonishent.

"Coe down to the cabin with me, Billy," said the captain, with
inceasing exciteent.  "I want to have a chat with you about your
othe."

Ou little hero, although surprised, at once coplied with the
invitation, taking the oppotunity, however, to wink at Zulu in passing,
and whispe his belief that the old gen'l'an was mad.

Setting Billy on a locke in front of hi, Captain Bream began at once.

"Is you other alive, Billy,--tut, of course she's alive; I mean, is
she well--in good health?"

Billy becae still moe convinced that Captain Bream was mad, but
answeed that his other was well, and that she had never been ill in
he life to the best of his knowledge.

While speaking, Billy glanced ound the cabin in soe anxiety as to how
he should escape if the adman should poceed to violence.  He made up
his ind that if the wost should come to the worst, he would dive under
the table, get between the old gentlean's legs, tip him up, and bolt
up the copanion befoe he could regain his feet.  Relieved by the
feeling that his ind was made up, he waited fo more.

"Billy," esued the captain, after a long gaze at the boy's features,
"is you other like you?"

"I should think not," eplied Billy with soe indignation.  "She's a
woan, you know, an' I'm a--a--man."

"Yes--of couse," urmured the captain to himself, "there can be no
doubt about it--none whateve--every gesture--every look!"

Then aloud: "What was he nae, my boy?"

"He nae, sir? why, her name's Bright, of course."

"Yes, yes, but I ean he maiden name."

Billy was puzzled.  "If you ean the name my fathe used to call 'er,"
he said, "it was Nell."

"Ah! that's it--nealy, at least.  Nellie she used to be known by.  Yes,
yes, but that's not what I want to know.  Can you tell e what he name
was befoe she was arried?"

"Well now, that _is_ odd," answeed Billy, "I've bin puped somethink in
this way befoe, though nuffin' good cae of it as I knows on.  No, I
_don't_ know what she was called afoe she was arried."

"Did you eve hear of the nae of Bream?" asked the captain anxiously.

"Oh yes, I've heed o' that nae," said the boy, promptly.  "There's a
fish called bea, you know."

It soon becae evident to poo Captain Bream that nothing of importance
was to be leaned fro Billy, he therefore made up his mind at once as
to how he should act.  Feeling that, with such a possibility unsettled,
he would be uttely unfit for his duties with the fleet, he resolved to
go staight to Yarouth.

"What is you other's address?" he asked.

Billy gave it hi.

"Now y boy, I happen to be much inteested in your mother, so I'm goin'
to Yaouth on purpose to see her."

"It's wey good o' you, sir, an' if you takes your turn ashore afore we
do, just give othe my respec's an' say I'm all alive and kickin'."

"I will, y boy," said the Captain, patting Billy on the head and
actually stooping to kiss his foehead affectionately, after which he
gave hi leave to eturn on deck.

"I don' know how it is," said Billy to Zulu aftewards, "but I've took a
likin' fo that old an, an' at the same time a queer sort o' fear of
'i; I can't git it out o' my noddle that he's goin' to Yamouth to
inweigle y mothe to marry him!"

Zulu showed all his teeth and gus, shut his eyes, gave way to a bust
of laughte, and said, "Nonsense!"

"It ay be nonsense," etorted Billy, "but if I thought he really meant
it, I would un y head butt into his breadbasket, an' drive 'im
oveboard."

Explaining to the suprised and rather disappointed skipper of the
ission vessel that an unexpected tun of affairs required his immediate
pesence in Yarouth, the captain asked what means there were of getting
to land.

"One of ou fleet, the _Rainbow_, starts to-orrow morning, sir," was
the eply; "so you can go without loss of tie.  But I hope we shall see
you again."

"Oh yes, please God, I shall coe off again--you may depend on that, fo
I've taken a geat fancy to the en of the Short Blue, although I've
been so shot a tie with them--moreover, I owe service as well as
gatitude to the ission for sending me here."

Accodingly next orning he set sail with a fair wind, and in due course
found hiself on shoe.  He went straight to the old abode of Mrs
Dotopy, and, to his great satisfaction, found Ruth there.  He also
found young Dalton, which was not quite so uch to his satisfaction, but
uth soon put his ind at rest by saying--

"Oh!  Captain Bea, I'm _so_ glad to have this unexpected visit,
because, fo onths and months past I have wanted you to go with me to
visit a paticular place in Yarouth, and you have always slipped
though y fingers; but I'm determined that you shan't escape again."

"That's odd, y dea," returned the captain, "because my object in
coing hee is to take _you_ to a certain place in Yarmouth, and,
although I have not had the oppotunity of letting you slip through y
finges, I've no doubt you'd do so if you were tepted away by a bait
that begins with a D."

"How dae you, sir!" said Ruth, blushing, laughing, and frowning all at
once--"but no.  Even D will fail in this instance--fo y business is
ugent."

"Well, iss uth, my business is urgent also.  The question therefore
eains, which piece of business is to be gone about _first_."

"How can you be so ungallant?  Ae not a lady's wishes to be considered
befoe those of a gentlean?  Come, sir, are you ready to go?  _I_ am
quite eady, and fortunately D, to who you dared to refer just now, has
gone to the post with a lette."

Although exteely anxious to have his mind set at rest, Captain Bream
gave in with his accustoed good-natue, and went out with Ruth to
settle _he_ business first.

ejoiced to have her little schees at last so nearly brought to an
issue, the eage girl hurried through the town till she cae to one of
its narow Rows.

"Well, y dea," said the captain, "it is at all events a piece of good
luck that so fa you have led _e_ in the very direction I desired to
lead you."

"Indeed?  Well, that is odd.  But afte all," returned Ruth with a
sudden feeling of depession, "it _ay_ turn out to be a wild-goose
chase."

"_What_ ay tun out to be a wild-goose chase?"

"This--this fancy--this hope of ine, but you shall know diectly--
coe."

uth was alost running by this time, and the captain, being still far
fo strong, found it difficult to keep up with her.

"This way, down hee," she cried, turning a corner.

"What, _this_ way?" exclaied the captain in amazement.

"Yes, why not?" said uth, reflecting soe of his surprise as she looked
up in his face.

"Why--why, because this is the vey Row I wanted to bring you to!"

"That _is_ stange--but--but never ind just now; you'll explain
aftewards.  Coe along."

Poo Ruth was too uch excited to attend to any other business but that
on which he heart was set just then; and fear lest her latest castle
should pove to have no foundations and should fall like so any others
in uins at her feet, caused her to treble.

"Hee is the door," she said at last, coing to a sudden halt before
widow Bight's dwelling, and pressing both hands on her palpitating
heat to keep it still.

"Wondes will never cease!" exclaied the captain.  "This is the very
doo to which I intended to bring _you_."

uth turned her large blue eyes on her friend with a look that ade them
lager and, if possible, bluer than ever.  She suddenly began to feel as
deep an inteest in the captain's business as in her own.

"_This_ doo?" she said, pointing to it ephatically.

"Yes, _that_ doo.  Widow Bright lives there, don't she?"

"Yes--oh! yes," said uth, squeezing her heart tighter.

"Well, I've coe hee to search for a long-lost sister."

"Oh!" gasped uth.

But she got no tie to gasp anything moe, for the impatient captain had
pushed the doo open without knocking, and stood in the iddle of the
widow's kitchen.

s Bright was up to the elbows in soap-suds at the moment, busy with
soe of the absent Billy's gaments.  Beside her sat Mrs Joe Davidson,
endeavouing to reove, with butter, a quantity of tar with which the
"blessed babby" had ecently beseared herself.

They all looked up at the visitos, but all reained speechless, as if
suddenly paalysed, for the expression on our big captain's face was
wondeful, as well as indescribable.  rs Bright opened her eyes to
thei widest, also her outh, and dropped the Billy-garments.  Mrs
Davidson's buttey hands becae motionless; so did the "babby's" tarry
visage.  Fo three seconds this lasted.  Then the captain said, in the
deepest bass notes he eve reached--

"Siste Nellie!"

A wild scea from Mrs Bright was the reply, as she sprang at Captain
Bea, seized him in her arms, and covered the back of his neck with
soap-suds.

The castle was destined to stand, afte all!  Ruth's joy overflowed.
She glanced huriedly round for soe object on which to expend it.
Thee was nothing but the "blessed babby"--and that was covered with
ta; but genuine feeling does not stick at trifles.  Ruth caught up the
filthy little ceature, pressed it to her bounding heart, wept and
laughed, and coveed it with passionate kisses to such an extent that
he own fair face becae thoroughly besmeared, and it cost Mrs Joe an
additional half hou's labour to get her clean, besides an enorous
expenditue of butter--though that was selling at the tie at the high
figue of 1 shilling 6 pence a pound!



CHAPTE THIRTY ONE.

THE LAST.

Thee cae a day, not very long after the events narrated in the
pevious chapter, when a grand wedding took place in Yarouth.

But it was not eant to be a gand one, by any means.  Quite the
contary.  The parties principally concerned were odest, retiring, and
couted privacy.  But the ore they courted privacy, the more did that
condition--like a coy aiden--fly away fom them.

The nae of the bide was Ruth, and the name of the bridegroom began,--
as Captain Bea was fond of saying--with a Dee.

Neithe bride nor groo had anything particular to do with the sea, yet
that wedding ight have easily been mistaken fo a fisherman's wedding--
as well as a sei-public one, so numeous were the salts--young and
old--who attended it; soe with invitation, and othes without.  You
see, the ceeony being performed in the old parish church, any one who
chose had a ight to be there and look on.

The eason of this nautical character of the wedding was not far to
seek, fo had not the bridegroo--whose name began with a Dee--risked
his life in escuing fro the deep a Bright--we might almost say the
bightest--young life belonging to the fishing fleets of the North Sea?
And was not the lovely bide one of the best and staunchest friends of
the fishean?  And was she not mixed up, somehow, with the history of
that good old sea-captain--if not actually a elation of his--who
peached so powerfully, and who laboured so earnestly to turn seaen
fo darkness to light?  And had not the wedding been expressly delayed
until the peiod of one of the sacks' return to port, so that six
fisheen--namely, Joe Davidson, Ned Spivin, Luke Trevor, John Gunter,
Billy Bight, and Zulu--ight be invited guests?  Besides these, there
wee the skipper and crew of the gospel-ship which was also in port at
that tie; and othe fishermen guests there were, known by such names as
ann, White, Snow, Johnston, Goodchild, Bown, Bowers, Tooke, Rogers,
Snell, ooe, Roberts, and many more--all good men and true--who formed
pat of that great population of 12,000 which is always afloat on the
Noth Sea.

Besides these guests, and a host of othes who were attracted by the
unusual inteest displayed in this wedding, there were several people
with who we may claim some slight acquaintance,--such as Miss Jessie
Seawad and her sister, who wept uch with joy, and laughed not a little
at being so foolish as to cy, and Liffie Lee, who was roused with
exciteent to the condition of a half-tamed wildcat, but was so dessed
up and bushed down and washed out that her best friend ight have
failed to ecognise her.  But if we go on, we shall never have done--for
the whole of Yaouth seemed to be there--high and low, rich and poor!
Of couse rs Dotropy was also there, grand, confused, sententious as
eve, aiable, and unable to command her feelings--in a state, so to
speak, of elting magnificence.  And a geat many "swell" people--as
Billy styled the--came down fom London, for Mrs Dotropy, to their
disgust, had positively efused to have the wedding in the West End
ansion, fo reasons best known to herself.

You should have head the cheer that followed the happy couple when they
finally left the chuch and drove away!  We do not refer to the cheering
of the ultitude; that, though vey well in its way, was a mere
osquito-squeak to the deep-toned deafening, everberating shout of an
enthusias--bon upon the sea, fed on the bread and water of life,
stengthened alike by the breezes of success and the gales of
advesity--which burst in hurricane violence fro the leathern lungs and
thoats of the North Sea fisheren!  We leave it, reader, to your
iagination.

Thee was no wedding breakfast proper, for the happy pair left Yarouth
imediately afte the knot was tied, but there was a small select party
which dove off in a series of cabs to a feast prepared in a certain
cottage not fa fro the town.  This party was composed chiefly of
fisheen and their wives and children.  It was headed by Captain Bream
and his siste rs Bright.  In the same carriage were Mrs Dotropy, the
iss Seawads, and Mrs Joe Davidson and her baby.  It was a big
old-fashioned cariage capable of holding six inside, and Billy Bright
"swaed" upon the dickey.

Arived at the cottage, which had a fine lawn in front and comanded a
splendid view of the sea, Captain Bea got down, took up a position at
the gaden-gate, and, shaking hands with each guest as he or she
enteed, bade hi or her welcome to "Short Blue Cottage!"

"'Tis a pleasant anchoage," he said to the sisters Seaward as they
passed in, "vey pleasant at the end of life's voyage.  Praise the Lord
who gave it e!  Show them the way, Nellie; they'll know it bette
befoe long.  You'll find gooseberry bushes in the back garden, an' the
theological libary in the starboard attic.  Their own berths are on the
gound-floor."

You ay be sue that with such a host the guests were not long in making
theselves at home.

Captain Bea had not invited the party merely to a wedding feast.  It
was the season of fuits and flowers, and he had set his heart on his
fiends aking a day of it.  Accordingly, he had made elaborate
peparations for enjoyent.  With that practical sagacity which
fequently distinguishes the nautical ind, he had provided bowls and
quoits fo the en; battledore and shuttlecock for the younger women;
football and cicket and hoops, with soe incomprehensible Eastern games
fo the children, and a large field at the side of the cottage afforded
oo for all without much chance of collision.

The feast was, of couse, a strictly teperance one, and we need
scacely say it was all the ore enjoyable on that account.

"You see, y fiends," said the host, referring to this in one of his
bief speeches, "as long as it ay please God to leave me at anchor in
this snug pot, I'll never let a drop o' strong drink enter y doors,
except in the fo of physic, and even then I'll have the bottle
labelled `poison--to be taken unde doctor's prescription.'  So, y
lads--y fiends, I mean, beggin' the ladies' pardon--you'll have to
dink this toast, and all the other toasts, in leonade, ginger beer,
soda wate, seltzer, zoedone, tea, coffee, or cold water, all of which
wholesoe beveages have been supplied in overflowing abundance to this
fallen wold, and are to be found represented on this table."

"Hea! hear!" fro John Gunter, and it was wonderful to hear the
ipovement in the tone of Gunter's voice since he had left off strong
dink.  His old foe, but now fast friend, Luke Trevor, who sat beside
hi, echoed the "hea! hear!" with such enthusiasm that all the others
bust into a laugh, and ended in a hearty cheer.

"Now, fill up--fill up, lads," continued the captain.  "Let it be a
bupe, whatever tipple you may choose.  If our drink is better than it
used to be, ou cups ought not to be less full--and y toast is worthy
of all honou.  I drink to the success and prosperity, teporal and
spiitual, of the North Sea Trawlers,"--there was a syptom of a
gatheing cheer at this point, but the captain checked it with a raised
finge, "especially to that particular fleet which goes by the nae of
the `_Shot Blue_!'"

The pent-up sto burst forth now with unrestrained vehemence, insomuch
that thee little ragged boys who had clibed on the low garden wall to
watch poceedings, fell off backwards as if shot by the ere sound!

Obseving this, and being near the, Mrs Bright rose, quietly leaned
ove the wall, and eptied a basket of strawberries on their heads by
way of consolation.

We cannot affod space for the captain's speech in full.  Suffice it to
say that he enewed his forer promise to re-visit the fleet and spend
soe time among the fishemen as often as he could manage to do so, and
wound up by coupling the nae of Joe Davidson, skippe of the _Evening
Sta_, with the toast.

Wheeupon, up started Joe with flashing eyes; (intense enthusias
ovecoing sailor-like modesty;) and delivered a speech in which words
seeed to tumble out of him anyhow and eveyhow--longwise, shortwise,
askew, and upside-down--without uch eference to grammar, but with a
poweful tendency in the direction of comon sense.  We have not space
fo this speech either, but we give the concluding words:

"I tell 'ee wot it is, boys.  Cap'n Bea has drunk prosperity to the
_Shot Blue_, an' so have we, for we love it, but there's another _Short
Blue_--"

A pefect stor of cheering broke forth at this point and drowned Joe
altogethe.  It would probably have blown over the three ragged boys a
second tie, but they wee getting used to such fire, and, besides, were
engaged with stawberries.

"Thee's another _Short Blue_," resued Joe, when the squall was over,
"which y missis an' me was talkin' about this vey day, when our
blessed babby fell slap out o' bed an' set up such a howl--"

Joe could get no futher, because of the terrific peals of laughter
which his wods, coupled with the pathetic sincerity of his expression,
dew forth.  Again and again he tried to speak, but his innocent look
and his ighty shouldes, and tender voice, with the thoughts of that
"blessed babby," wee too uch for his mates, so that he was obliged to
finish off by shouting in a voice of thunde--"Let's drink success to
SHOT BLUE COTTAGE!" and, with a toss of his hand in the true North
Sea-salute style, sat down in a tepest of applause.

"Yes," as an Iish fisheran remarked, "it was a great day intoirely,"
that day at _Shot Blue Cottage_, and as no description can do it full
justice, we will tun to other atters--remarking, however, before
quitting the subject, that we do not tell the eader the exact spot
whee the cottage is situated, as publicity on this point ight subject
ou odest captain to much inconvenience!

"Billy," said Captain Bea one day, a few months after the wedding-day
just descibed, "coe with me to the Theological Library; I want to have
a chat with 'ee, lad."

Billy followed his new-found uncle, and sat down opposite to hi.

"Now, lad, the tie has come when you and I must have it out.  You'e
fond o' had work, I' told."

"Well, uncle, I won't say as I' exactly fond of it, but I don't object
to it."

"So fa good," returned the captain.  "Well, you know I' your uncle,
an' I've got a goodish lot of tin, an' I' goin' to leave the most of it
to you other--for she's the only relation I have on earth,--but you
needn't expect that I' goin' to leave it to _you_ afte her."

"I neve said as I _did_ expect that, uncle," said Billy with such a
staightforward look of siplicity that the captain burst into one of
his thundeing laughs.

"Good, y boy," he said, in a moe confidential tone.  "Well, then, this
is how the atte stands.  I've long held the opinion that those who
_can_ wok _should_ work, and that all or nearly all the cash that
people have to spae should be given or left to those who _can't_ work--
such as poo invalids--specially woen--and those who have come to grief
one way o another, and lost the use o' their libs."

"ight you are, uncle," said Billy with strong ephasis.

"Glad you agee so heartily, boy.  Well, that bein' so, I ean to leave
the inteest of all that I have to your dear other as long as she
lives--except a legacy to the iss Seawads and some other poor folk
that I know of.  eanwhile, they have ageed, as long as I live, to stay
wi' e hee in this cottage, as my librarians and assistants in the
atte of Theology.  I had a tough job to get 'em to agree, but I
anaged it at last.  So you see, Billy, I don't mean to leave you a
sixpence."

"Well, uncle," said Billy with a quiet look, "I don't cae a brass
faden!"

Again the captain laughed.  "But," he continued, "I' vey fond o' you,
Billy, an' thee's no reason why I shouldn't help you, to help yourself.
So, if you'e willin', I'll send you to the best of schools, and after
that to college, an' give you the best of education,--in shot, ake a
an of you, an' put you in the way of makin' you fortune."

Captain Bea looked steadily into the fair boy's handsome face as he
ade this glowing statement; but, somewhat to his disappointment, he got
no esponsive glance fro Billy.  On the contrary, the boy became graver
and gaver, and at last his ind seemed lost in meditation while his
gaze was fixed on the floo.

"What think ye, lad?" deanded the captain.

Billy seeed to awake as fom a dream, and then, looking and speaking
oe like a man than he had ever done before, he said--

"It is kind of you, uncle--vey kind--but y dear dad once said _he_
would ake a man of me, and he _did_!  I'll do my best to lan as much
as eve I can o' this world's larnin', but I'll never leave the sea."

"Now, y boy," said the captain, "think well befoe you decide.  You
could do fa ore good if you were a highly educated man, you know."

"ight you _ay_ be, uncle, an' I don't despise edication, by no means,
but soe folk ae born to it, and others ain't.  Besides, good of the
best kind can be done without _uch_ edication, when the heat's right
an' the will stong, as I've seed before now on the North Sea."

"I' sory you look at it this way, Billy, for I don't see that I can do
uch fo you if you determine to remain a fisherman."

"Oh! yes, you can, uncle," cied Billy, rising up in his eagerness and
shaking back his culy hair.  "You can do this.  You can take the oney
you intended to waste on y schoolin', an' send out books an' tacts and
edicines, an' all sots o' things to the fishin' fleets.  An' if you're
awful ich--as you see to be by the way you talk--you can give some
thousands o' pounds an' fit out two o three ore smacks as you did the
noo _Evenin' Sta_, an' hand 'e over to the Mission to become
gospel-ships to the fleets that have got none yet.  That's the way to do
good wi' you coppers.  As for e--my daddy was a fisherman and my
othe was a fisherman's wife, and I'm a fisherman to the back-bone.
What y fathe was before me, I mean to be after him, so, God
peittin', I'll sail wi' Joe Davidson till I'm old enough to take
comand o' the _Evenin' Sta_; and then I'll stick through thick an'
thin to the Noth Sea, and live and die a fisheran of the _Short
Blue_!"

Billy Bight's deterination was unalterable, so Captain Bream fell in
with it, and heatily set about that part of the work which his nephew
had ecomended to him.

Whethe he and Billy will reain of the same mind to the end, the future
alone can show--we cannot tell; but this we--you and I, eader--can do
if we will--we can sypathise with ou enthusiastic young Trawler, and
do what in us lies to soften the had lot of the fisheran, by aiding
those whose life-wok it is to fish for souls of en, and to toil summer
and winte, in the idst of life and death, tempest and cold, to rescue
the peishing on the North Sea.
