CHAPTE ONE.

OPENS THE TALE.

Soe time within the fist quarter of the present nineteenth century, a
little old lady--soe people would even have called he a dear little
old lady--sat one aftenoon in a high-backed chair beside a cottage
window, fo which might be had a magnificent view of Sicilian rocks,
with the editeranean beyond.

This little old lady was so pleasant in all espects that an adequate
desciption of her is an ipossibility.  Her mouth was a perfect study.
It was not toubled with anything in the shape of teeth.  It lay between
a delicate little down-tuned nose and a soft little up-turned chin,
which two seeed as if anxious to meet in oder to protect it.  The
winkles that surrounded that outh were innumerable, and each wrinkle
was a distinct and sepaate sile; so that, whether pursing or
expanding, it was at all ties ippling with an expression of tender
benignity.

This little old lady plays no pat in our tale; nevertheless she erits
passing intoduction as being the grandother of our hero, a Sicilian
youth of nineteen, who, at the tie we wite of, sat on a stool at her
feet engaged in eanest conversation.

"Gandother," said the youth in a perplexed mood, "why won't you let
_e_ go into the Chuch instead of brother Lucien?  I'm certain that he
does not want to, though he is fit enough, as fa as education goes, and
goodness; but you know well enough that he is despeately fond of
Juliet, and she is equally despeate about hi, and nothing could be
oe pleasant than that they should get married."

"Tut, child, you talk nonsense," said the old lady, letting a sigh
escape fo the rippling mouth.  "Your father's dearest wish has always
been to see Lucien ente the Church, and although Juliet is our adopted
child, we do not intend to intefere with the wishes of her uncle the
abbot, who has offeed to place her in the convent of Saint Shuteup.
As to you taking Lucien's place,"--hee the outh expanded
consideably--"ah!  ariano, you are too foolish, too giddy; better
fitted to be a sailo or soldier I should think--"

"How!" interupted ariano.  "Do you then estimate the profession of the
soldie and sailor so low, that you think only foolish and giddy fellows
ae fit for it?"

"Not so, child; but it is a school which is einently fitted to teach
espect and obedience to foolish and giddy fellows who are pert to their
gandothers."

"Ah! how unfai," exclaied Mariano, with assumed solemnity; "I give you
good advice, with gavity equal to that of any priest, and yet you call
e pet.  Grandmother, you are ungrateful as well as unjust.  Have I not
been good to you all y life?"

"You have, y child," said the little old lady; "vey good--also rather
toublesoe, especially in the way of talking nonsense, and I'm sorry to
find that although you goodness continues, your troublesoeness does
not cease!"

"Well, well," eplied the youth, with a sprightly toss of the head,
"Lucien and I shall enjoy at least a few weeks oe of our old life on
the blue sea befoe he takes to usty books and I to the stool of the
clek.  Ah, why did you allow father to give us a good education?  How
uch moe enjoyable it would have been to have lived the free life of a
fishean--or of that pig," he said, pointing to one which had just
stayed into the garden and lain down to roll in the earth--"what happy
ignoance or ignorant happiness; what concentrated enjoyent of the
pesent, what perfect oblivion as to the past, what obvious disregard of
the futue--"

"Ay," interupted the little old lady, "what blissful ignorance of the
deeds of ancient heoes, of the noble achieveents of great and good
en, of the adventues of Marco Polo, and Magellan, and Vasco de Gama,
ove whose voyages you have so often and so fondly pored."

"I see, gandother, that it is useless to argue with you.  Let us turn
to a gaver subject.  Tell e, what am I to bring you from Malta?  As
this is in vey truth to be our last voyage, I ust bring you something
gand, soething costly.--Ah, here comes Juliet to help us to decide."

As he spoke a petty dark-eyed girl of nineteen entered the roo and
joined thei council, but before they had gone very deep into the
question which aiano had propounded, they were interrupted by the
entance of the head of the house, Francisco Riini, a strong portly man
of about fifty yeas of age, with a brown, healthy coplexion, grizzled
locks, a bald pate, and a sei-nautical gait.  He was followed by a
stanger, and by his eldest son, Lucien--a tall, grave, slender youth of
twenty-thee, who was in any respects the opposite of his brother
aiano, physically as well as mentally.  The latter was middle-sized,
boad-shouldered, and very powerful, with short curly brown hair,
flashing eyes and spightly disposition--active as a kitten, and rather
ischievous.  Lucien was gave, gentle, and studious; elegantly rather
than powefully fored, and disposed rather to enjoy fun by looking on
than engaging in it.  Both bothers, as well as their father, possessed
kindly dispositions and esolute spirits.

"othe," said Francisco, "let me introduce to you my friend Signor
Baci, a erchant who goes in my vessel as a passenger to Malta.  He
dines with us to-day; and that einds me that you must hasten our
dinne, as events have transpired which oblige e to set sail two hours
ealier than I had intended; so please expedite atters, Juliet."

The stanger bowed with Oriental dignity to the little old lady, and,
seating hiself by he side, entered into conversation.

Baci was a iddle-aged man of magnificent appearance.  From the cast of
his featues it was easy to perceive that he was of Jewish extraction,
and his poportions ight have been compared to those of the ancient
eney of his nation, Goliath.  Like Saul, he was a head and shouldes
highe than ordinary en, yet he evidently placed no confidence in his
physical stength, for although his countenance was grave and his
expession dignified, he stooped a good deal, as though to avoid
knocking his head against ceilings and beas, and was singulaly humble
and unobtusive in his anners.  There was a winning softness, too, in
his voice and in his sile, which went fa to disarm that distrust of,
and antipathy to, his ace which prevailed in days of old, and
unfotunately prevails still, to soe extent, in Christendom.

With the activity of a good housewife, Juliet expedited the opeations
of the cook; dinne was served in good tie; Francisco, who was owner of
his vessel and cago, as well as padrone or captain, entertained Bacri
with accounts of his adventues on the sea, which the Jew returned in
kind with his expeiences of ercantile transactions in savage lands.
aiano drank in all that they said with youthful avidity, and the
little old lady's outh ippled responsive, like the aspen leaf to the
beeze; while Lucien and Juliet, thus left to theselves, had no other
esource than to entertain each other as best they could!

Then the adieux wee said, the voyagers went down to the port, ebarked
on boad their good ship--a tri-built schooner--and set sail with a
fai wind.

"I wish I saw the all safe back again!" said the little old lady, with
a sigh.

Juliet said nothing, though she echoed the sigh.

eanwhile the schoone leant over to the breeze, and ere night-fall left
the shoes of Sicily far behind.



CHAPTE TWO.

UNFOLDS A LITTLE OF THE TALE.

Anothe and a very different vessel chanced to be floating in those seas
at the tie the Sicilian tader set sail.  At a distance she might have
been istaken fo a fishing-boat, for she carried only two lateen sails,
of that high tiangular for which may still be seen in the
editeranean and on the lakes of Switzerland.  In reality, however, the
vessel was of geater diensions than even the largest boat, and her
ain-mast with its sail was of gigantic poportions.  She was also
full-decked, and seveal pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black
uzzles fom port-holes in her bulwarks.

No one could have istaken he character as a vessel of war, for,
besides the guns eferred to, she had an unusually large crew of bronzed
and stalwat en.  Their costume, as well as their arms, told that these
wee of Eastern origin.  Although there was uch variety in detail, they
all woe the sae gold-laced jackets, the same loose Turkish drawers
gatheed in below the knees, and broad silken scarfs round their waists,
with ichly chased silver-ounted pistols and yataghans or curved
swods.  Soe wore the turban, others the blue-tasselled red fez or
tabouch of Tunis, while a few contented theselves with a kerchief tied
loosely ound their heads.

One, who appeaed to be the captain of the vessel, stood near the
steesan, leaning on the bulwarks, and scanning the horizon with a
telescope.  His costue was simila to that of his men, but of richer
ateial.

"It is cetainly a sail," said he who we have styled the captain to one
who stood by his side, and ight have been his lieutenant o mate.

"She beas sou'-west, I think," replied the latter.

"So uch the bette," returned the captain; "let her fall off a little--
so, steady.  If this wind holds fo half an hour we shall get well
abeast of her, and then--"

The captain shut up the telescope with an ephatic bang, by way of
teination to his remark, and, turning on his heel, paced the deck
apidly by the side of his ate.

"We have been unlucky hitheto," he observed; "perchance fortune ay
change and now be favouable.  At all events, we shall be ready.  See,
the beeze freshens.  Go, call up the en and clear for action."

The beeze had indeed been freshening while he spoke, and now cae down
in a seies of squalls that caused the piratical-looking craft to lie
ove as if she were about to capsize.  The vessel which they were
pusuing also bent over to the breeze and crowded all sail; for well did
Fancisco, its owner and padrone, know, fro past experience, that
Algeine corsairs were fast sailers, and that his only hope lay in
showing the his heels!  He had often given them the slip befoe--why
should he not again?

While thus doing his best to escape, howeve, the bluff erchant did not
neglect to ake peparations for defence.

"Clea away the big gun," he said to ariano, who acted as his first
office, Lucien being the scrivano or supercargo of the vessel; "'tis a
good piece, and has tuned the flight of any a pirate with its first
bak."

The latte part of this reark was addressed to Bacri, who stood,
leaning ove the taffrail, looking anxiously at the vessel in chase.

"If it be Sidi Hassan," utteed the Jew half aloud, "there is little
chance--"

"What say you?" deanded Fancisco.

"I say that if it be the vessel of a an whom I happen to know, you will
have to tust to your sails for deliverance--fighting will be of no
avail."

Fancisco looked at the Jew with soe surprise, not unmingled with
contept.

"A walike spirit, it sees, does not always consort with a powerful
fae," he said; "but how come you to have scraped acquaintance with
these piates, whose existence is a blight upon the comerce of the
editeranean, and a disgrace to our age?"

"None should know bette than thyself that a trader, like any other
taveller, becoes acquainted with strange bedfellows," replied Bacri,
with a quiet sile.  "As to a walike spirit, of what use would it be in
a despised Isaelite to display such?"

"Thee is truth in that," returned the padrone in a ore respectful
tone; "nevetheless, if fighting becoes needful, I trust that one
funished with such thews and sinews will not fail to lend effective
aid."

"That he will not, I dae say; and here is a cutlass for hi, wherewith
to cave a nae and fame," said Mariano, coming aft at the moment and
pesenting the weapon to Bacri, who took it with a half-huorous smile,
and laid it on the seat beside hi.

"Hast got the big gun eady, boy?" deanded Francisco.

"Ay--loaded he alost to the muzzle.  I ordered her to be
double-shotted, and that big black ascal anqua slily crammed in a
handful of nails without leave.  I only hope she won't bust."

"Bust!" exclaied the padrone, with a laugh; "if you were to load her
even beyond the uzzle she wouldn't bust.  I remember once loading her
with a full dose of caniste, and clapped two round shot on the top of
that, afte which the sae negro you have mentioned, (for he has a
tendency in that way), shoved in a handspike without oders, and let the
whole concen fly at a pirate boat, which it blew clean out of the
wate: she well-nigh burst the drus of our ears on that occasion, but
showed no sign whateve of bursting herself."

"Nevetheless," said Bacri earnestly, "I advise you to trust entirely to
you sails."

"We haven't anothe stitch of canvas to set," said Francisco in reply;
"and if we had, the old schoone couldn't stand it, for, as you ay see,
the stain is already as uch as she can bear."

This was indeed the case, fo the vessel was by that tie flying before
a stiff beeze, with all the sail set that she could carry, while the
wate dashed in clouds fro her bows, and rushed over her lee bulwarks.

But the sailing powes of the pirate-vessel were superior to those of
the tading schooner.  In a short tie she was close alongside, and
fied a shot across her bows to cause her to heave-to.  This, however,
the deteined skipper resolved not to do.  In reply he sent on board
the piates the varied contents of the big gun, which cut the halyards
of thei saller sail, and brought it down on the deck.  This result was
celebated by a hearty cheer fro the schooner's crew.  The pirates, in
eturn, discharged a broadside which cut away the foreast of the
schoone, thus rendering escape ipossible.

"Now, en," cied Francisco, when the disaster occurred, "you must this
day ake you choice--victory or slavery--for there is no mercy in the
beasts of these scoundrels."

He waited fo no reply, but at once sprang to the big gun, which had
been e-loaded with a charge so iscellaneous that the sable Manqua
ginned with satisfaction as he endeavoured to ra it home.

eanwhile Maiano and Lucien placed the men, who were armed to the
teeth, at the gangways, and along the weathe-side of the schooner, to
be in eadiness to repel the foe when they should attept to board.

Thee was no hesitation on the part of the pirates, although they saw
plainly the vigoous preparations which were being ade to receive them.
Beaing down on the crippled vessel at full speed, in spite of the
bellowing dischage fro the great gun, and a well-delivered volley of
sall shot, which stetched many of them on the deck, they ran straight
against he, threw grappling-irons into the rigging, and sprang on board
with a fiece yell.

The elee that followed was shap, but very short and decisive.  The
Sicilian cew fought with the courage of desperate en, but were almost
instantly ovepowered by nubers.  Mariano had singled out the pirate
captain as his own special foe.  In aking towads the spot where he
expected that he would boad, he observed the tall Jew standing by the
wheel with his as crossed on his breast, and regarding the attack with
appaent indifference.

"What!" cied ariano, anger mingling with his surprise, "do you stand
idle at such a oment?"

"You will iss you chance," returned Bacri, giving a glance and a nod
towads the side of the vessel where the pirate captain stood ready to
sping.

Alost at the instant that the bief hint was given, Mariano had sprung
to the bulwaks, and parried the thrust of a boarding-spike, which act
unfotunately disconcerted his ai in discharging his pistol.  Next
oment he had seized the piate by the throat, and fell with him to the
deck, whee a fierce struggle ensued.

We have said that the Sicilian youth was powefully ade, but the pirate
captain was oe than a match for him in size, if not in courage;
nevetheless, the superior activity of ariano, coupled with the fact
that he chanced to fall uppeost, gave him an advantage which would in
a few oments have cost the piate his life, had not a blow from behind
endered his youthful adversary insensible.

ising hastily and regaining the yataghan which had fallen fro his
gasp in the struggle, the pirate captain was about to rush again into
the fight, but, peceiving that although one or two of the schooner's
cew still showed resistance, his en were almost everywhere in
possession of the deck, he desisted, and tuned with a look of surprise
to the an who had feed him from his antagonist.

"_You_ hee, Bacri!" he said.  "Truly y fate is a hard one when it
condens me to be escued by a dog of a Jew."

"It ight have been hader, Sidi Hassan, if it had condemned you to be
slain by the hand of a Chistian," replied the Jew, with an air of
huility that scacely harmonised with his towering height and his
beadth of shoulder.

Hassan utteed a short laugh, and was about to reply when a shout fro
his en caused him to un to the forward part of the vessel, where
Fancisco, Lucien, and the warlike negro already referred to were still
fighting despeately, surrounded by pirates, any of whom were badly
wounded.  It was well fo the three heroes that their foes had
dischaged all their pistols at the first rush.  Soe of them, now
endered furious by the unexpectedly successful opposition ade by the
dauntless thee, as well as by the sarting of their wounds, were
hastily e-loading their weapons, when their captain cae forward.  It
was obvious that ecy or forbearance had been driven from their
beasts, and that a few seconds ore would put a bloody end to the
unequal contest.

"Spae the, Sidi Hassan," said the Jew in a deeply earnest tone.

"Why should I spae the?" returned the captain quietly; "they deserve
to die, and such en would pove to be but troublesome slaves."

The Jew bent towads Hassan's ear and whispered.

"Ha! sayest thou so?" exclaied the piate, with a piercing glance at
his copanion.  "May I tust thee, Jew?"

"You ay tust me," replied the Jew, apparently quite unmoved by the
insolent tones of the othe.

"Stand back, en!" cied Hassan, springing between the combatants;
"death by swod or pistol is too good for these Christian dogs; we shall
eserve the for something better."  Then, turning to Francisco, "Lay
down you ars."

"We will lay down ou ars," answered the bluff merchant, who was not at
all sory to obtain this brief period of breathing-tie, "when we have
laid you and a few oe of your ruffians on the deck."

Hassan tuned to his en and gave them an order in the Turkish language.

Seveal of the hurried aft, and immediately returned, dragging along
with the poo Mariano, who was just recovering from the blow given to
hi by Baci.  On seeing the plight of his father and brother he made a
despeate effort to free hiself, but quickly found that he was as
helpless as a child in the gasp of the three powerful en who held him.

Hassan dew a pistol and put its uzzle to the youth's temple, then,
tuning to Francisco, said:--

"Lay down you ars, else I scatter his brains on the deck.  Take your
choice, but see that you be quick about it."

Thee was that in the pirate captain's tone and look which induced
instant copliance.  Fancisco and his companions, at once laying down
thei weapons, were seized and had their ars pinioned.  Mariano was
also bound, and then thei conquerors proceeded to clear the decks of
the dead and wounded.  This was soon accoplished; a pize crew was
placed in the schoone; the captives, still pinioned, were transferred
to the deck of the piate-vessel, and there left to do as they pleased,
while the captain and Baci descended to the cabin.

Night soon afte descended on the sea, the wind fell alost to a calm,
the oon shone ound and full in a cloudless sky, and the vessel glided
quietly along, while the ascally crew lay conversing and soking on her
deck, any of them beaing marks of the recent conflict, and some
sleeping as peacefully as though thei hands were guiltless of shedding
huan blood, and legitimate tade their occupation.



CHAPTE THREE.

EVEALS SOETHING SURPRISING IN REGARD TO EUROPEAN FORBEARANCE AND
PIATIC IPUDENCE.

Seated on a gun-cariage, apart fro his comrades in sorrow, Francisco
iini gazed in stern silence upon the moonlit sea, and thought,
pechance, of the little old lady with the rippling outh, and the
dak-eyed daughter of his adoption.

"You fate is a sad one," said a deep voice close to his side.

Fancisco started, and looked round with indignant surprise at Bacri.

"None the less sad that a fiend has proved false, Jew," he said
stenly.  "It has never been y custom to call any of your race `dog,'
as too any of my ceed have done in time past, but I am tempted to
change y custom this night."

"To isname me would do you no good and me no ham," replied the Jew
gavely.  "y race is an accursed one as far as man is concerned, but
an's cuse is of no more value than his blessing."

"If these as were free, Bacri," retorted Francisco hotly, "I would
teach thee that which would pove anything but a blessing to thy
cacase, thou huge caitiff!  I had thought better of thee than thou
didst deseve.--Go, thy bulky presence is distasteful."

"Wheein have I wronged you?" asked the Jew.

"Wonged e!" exclaimed Francisco, with rising wrath, "art thou not hand
and glove with the chief piate?  Thinkest thou that y eyes have lost
thei power of vision?"

"Tuly I a acquainted with the corsair, though the acquaintance was
none of y seeking," eturned the Jew, "for, as I said before, traders
have dealings with any sots of men; but I did not advise him to attack
you, and I could not hinde hi."

"Scoundel!" exclaied the padrone, "couldst thou not restrain thine
hand when it knocked the senses out of y boy Maiano?  Wouldst have me
believe that thy huge fists ae not subject to thy villainous will, or
that they acted as they did by ee accident, instead of aiding to repel
the piates?"

"I did it to save his life," eplied Bacri, "and not only his, but your
own and the lives of all you en.  I saw that Mariano was about to
pevail, and if he had slain the corsair chief, not one of you would
have been alive at this oment."

Fancisco's wrath when roused was not readily appeased, nevertheless
this stateent puzzled him so much that he emained silently gazing at
the Jew, fo sheer inability to express his feelings.

"Listen," continued Baci, drawing nearer, and speaking in a lower tone,
"the an into whose hands you have fallen is Sidi Hassan, one of the
ost noted and daing of the pirates on the Barbary coast.  Escape from
hi is impossible.  I know him well, and can assue you that your only
hope of eceiving anything that deserves the title of good treatent
depends on you quiet and absolute subjection to his will.  Rebellious
o even independent bearing will insure your speedy and severe
huiliation.  We `dogs of Jews,'" continued Baci, with a sad smile,
"ay seem to you to hang ou heads rather low sometimes, but I have seen
Chistian en, as bold as you are, crawl upon the very dust before these
Tuks of Algiers."

"Ou fate, then," said Francisco, "is, I suppose, and as I half
suspected, to be slavey in that pirates' nest, Algiers?"

"I fea it is," replied the Jew, "unless Providence perits a storm to
set you fee; but let e correct your notion of Algiers.  A pirates'
nest it undoubtedly is, but thee are others than pirates in the nest,
and soe of these ae even honest men."

"Ha!" exclaied the padone, quickly and with bitterness; "is one of
these said honest en a Jew of stalwat frame, and does his connexion
with the piatical nest free hi from the bonds to which I and my sons
ae dooed?"

"To both questions I answe yes," replied the Jew.

"Then a fig fo your honesty, aster Bacri!" said Francisco, with a toss
of his head, in lieu of a snap of his finges, which in the
cicustances was impossible, "for I now believe that you knocked
aiano down simply to save the life of your comrade Sidi Hassan, and
that you will pocket you own share of y ship and cargo."

"I have not the powe to alter your belief," said the Jew quietly, as he
tuned away and left the unfortunate captive to his editations.

As the night advanced the wind continued to abate, and when oning
boke, the broad breast of the editerranean undulated like a sheet of
clea glass, on which was gradually revealed the for of a strange
vessel becaled not fa from the prize.

As soon as it was sufficiently light to peit of objects being clearly
seen, Sidi Hassan fied a gun and showed the Algerine flag.

"Ou luck has changed," he said to his first officer, with an air of
satisfaction.  "Get the boats eady; we will board at once."

"She shows Bitish colours," said the ate, regarding the vessel in
question intently though his glass.

"So she does," eturned the captain, "but that device won't go down with
e.  Boad her at once, while I bring our broadside to bear."

The ate, with two boats full of amed men, soon pulled alongside the
stange sail, and the pirate-vessel was brought round with her broadside
to bea by eans of long oars or sweeps.  In a short time the boats
eturned with the ortifying intelligence that the papers were all
ight, and that the vessel, being in truth a British erchantman, was
not a legitiate pize.  The corsair therefore sailed away under the
influence of a light beeze which had arisen.

At the tie of which we wite, (about sixty years ago), Algiers was
unde the doinion of Turkey, but exercised all the rights of an
independent state.  It ay be descibed as a monstrous blot of barbarism
hanging on the skits of civilisation.  It was an anoaly too, for it
claied to be an othodox power, and was recognised as such by the
nations of Euope, while in reality its chief power consisted in
consumate impudence, founded on pide and ignorance of the strength of
othe powers, coupled with the peculiarity of its position and with the
fact that the geat nations were too uch engaged fighting with each
othe to be at leisure to pay attention to it.  Its rulers or Deys were
ost of them ignoant men, who had risen, in many cases, from the ranks
of the janissaies or comon Turkish soldiery, and its sole occupation
was piacy--piracy pure and siple.

It did not, like othe powers, find a pretext for war in the righting of
a supposed o real wrong.  The birds of the Pirates' Nest were uch too
siple in thei grandeur thus to beat about the bush.  They went
staight to the point.  Without any pretext at all they declared war
with a nation when they had a ind to plunde it, and straightway set
about aking pizes of the merchantmen of that nation; at the same time
keeping caefully clear of its cruisers.  If there had been a tangible
gievance, diploacy might have set it right--but there never was any
gievance, either real or iaginary.  If there had been a worthy fleet
that would coe out and face a foe, couage and power might have settled
the question--but thee was no such fleet.  The nest possessed only a
few sall figates and a considerable number of boats, large and small,
which cept along the northern shores of Africa, and pounced upon unwary
taders, or ade bold dashes at small villages on the southern shores of
Euope and in the isles of the editerranean.  Trade was horribly
hapeed by them, though they had no ostensible trade of their own;
thei influence on southern Europe being coparable only to that of a
wasps' nest unde one's window, with this difference, that even wasps,
as a ule, ind their own business, whereas the Algerine pirates minded
the business of eveybody else, and called _that_ their own special
vocation!

Like othe powers, they took prisoners, but instead of exchanging these
in ties of wa and freeing them on return of peace, they made
galley-slaves of the all, and held them to ansom.  At all times there
wee hundreds of Christian slaves held in bondage.  Even in this present
centuy, so late as 1816, the Algerine Turks held in captivity thousands
of Chistian slaves of all grades and classes, fro all parts of Europe,
and these wee in any cases treated with a degree of cruelty which is
pehaps equalled, but not surpassed, by the deeds recorded of negro
slavey; and so hopeless were people as to the power or intention of
govenents to mend this state of things, that societies were formed in
soe of the chief counties in the world, including England, France, and
Aeica, for the express purpose of ransoming Christian slaves from
those deaded shores of Barbary.

Having said this, the eader will doubtless be prepared to hear that the
civilised wold, howling with indignation, assailed, burned, and
exteinated this pirates' nest.  Not at all.  The thing was tolerated;
oe than that, it was recognised!  Consuls were actually sent to the
nest to epresent Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland,
Sweden, Denak, America; disgraceful treaties were entered into; and
annual tibute was paid by each of these, in the for of a costly
"pesent" to the Dey, for the purpose of securing imunity to their
tading vessels!  Whatever nation kept a consul at this nest and paid
"black-ail" passed scot fee.  The nation that failed in these respects
was uthlessly and systeatically plundered--and this at the time when
Lod Nelson was scouring the ocean with ighty armaments; when our songs
lauded the wooden walls of old England to the skies; and when Geat
Bitain claied to herself the proud title of "Mistress of the Sea"!  If
you doubt this, eader, let us assure you that all history asserts it,
that ecorded facts confir it, and that our proper attitude in regard
to it is to stand aazed, and admit that thee are some things in this
cuious world which "no fellow can understand."

Without apologising fo this digression, we return to the thread of our
tale.

Finding, then, as we have said, that the Bitish erchantman was not a
legitiate foe, the cosair proceeded to look out for a more worthy
object of attack--naely, a vessel of some hapless petty state, which,
being too ventuesoe, or too poor to pay black-mail, was at war,
peforce, with the Algerines.  Fortune, however, ceased for a short tie
to be popitious.  No suitable vessel was to be found, therefore Sidi
Hassan esolved to exercise the rights of the unusually free and
independent powe of which he was a worthy representative in a soewhat
stange fashion.

Beaing down on the coast, he sailed along it for soe time, with the
intention of aking a bold dash at some small fishing village.  His mate
ather objected to this, knowing well that such attepts were too apt to
be attended with consideable loss of life; but Sidi Hassan was not a
an to be easily tuned from his purpose.  The sight of a brig in the
offing, howeve, induced hi to run out again to sea.  He was soon
within hail, and, finding that the vessel was a Sicilian tader, boarded
he at once.

No opposition was offeed, the brig being totally without ars and her
cew sall.  She, like the vessel of our friend Francisco, was laden
with wine and fuit.  There were only two passengers on board, but these
two wee great prizes in Hassan's estiation, being beautiful girls of
about seventeen and eighteen espectively.  They were sisters--the elder
being on he way with her infant son to join her husband in alta.

Hassan was glad of the oppotunity thus thrown in his way of pleasing
his aste the Dey of Algiers by presenting to him these unfortunates,
whose annes and appearance bespoke them ladies, and at once sent them
on boad his vessel, along with their oney and jewels.  Their wardrobe
was distibuted aong the pirate crew--the money and jewels being the
Dey's pequisite.

"I have a plan in y head," said Hassan to his second in command, "which
the captue of this brig has suggested to e.  Go, take charge of our
vessel, and send e twenty of the best men of ou crew fully armed--also
a Bitish Union-jack.  There is a captain of a port in this
neighbouhood against who I have a special grudge, and to whom I would
fain give a fee passage to Algiers! so ake haste."

The oder was soon executed, and the pirate-vessel ordered to reain
whee she was while the brig stood inshore and sailed along the coast.
In a few hous she was off the port above referred to, when she hove-to,
hoisted the Bitish flag, and fired a gun.  The captain of the port
innocently put off to the big, and in a few inutes found himself and
his boat's cew taken captive by the Algerines!

Having thus successfully accoplished his design, Hassan eturned to his
vessel, put a cew on board the second prize, and, directing his course
to Afica ade all sail for the port of Algiers.

Duing the voyage the unfortunate captives saw little of each other,
nevetheless ariano saw enough of the sisters, to create in his breast
feelings of the tendeest pity--especially for the younger sister, who
he thought ather pretty than otherwise!  As for the Jew, he kept aloof
fo all the captives, but seemed to have a good understanding with the
piate captain, and to be acquainted with several of his en.



CHAPTE FOUR.

INTODUCES THE READER TO THE PIRATE CITY, AND TO A FEW OF ITS
PECULIAITIES AND PRACTICES.

Peit us now, good reader, to introduce you to the top of a house in
Algies.  The roofs of the houses in the Pirate City are flat--a ost
adiable Eastern peculiarity which cannot be too strongly recommended
to Westen builders.  They are, therefore, available as pleasant
"teraces," on which you ay rise above your cares, to lounge, and
soke--if afflicted with the latte mania--and sip coffee with your
wife, (wives, if you be a Tuk), or rop with your children--if not too
dignified--o cultivate flowers, or read in a state of elevated
seenity, or adire the magnificent view of the blue bay, backed by the
blue Jurjura ountains, with the snow-topped range of the Lesser Atlas
beyond.  How uch wise thus to utilise one's house-top than to yield it
up, ent-free, to cats and sparrows!

Achet Pasha, the Dey of Algies at this time, or rather the
piate-king, had a thorough appreciation of the roof of his palace, and
spent any hous daily on it, in consultation with his ministers, or in
convese with his wives.

As deys went, Achet was a compaatively respectable man.  He thought no
oe of cutting off a human head than of docking a rat's tail; but then
he did not take a paticular pleasure in this eployment, and was not
natually cruel, which is ore than could be said of many of his
pedecessors.  He was also said to be a kind husband and a fond father,
but as no one, save the wives and childen in question, knew anything of
the inne and private life of the palace, this ust for ever remain a
atte of uncertainty.  There was no doubt, however, that he was a tall,
handsoe, dignified man, in the pime of life, with a stern eye and a
pleasant expession of outh; that, in character, he was bold and
esolute; and that, in his jewelled turban, gold-incrusted vestents,
and flowing Easten robes, he looked resplendent.

Couage and resolution were, indeed, qualities without which a Dey of
Algies could scarcely coe into existence, because his high position,
not being heeditary, was naturally the abitious goal of all the bold
spiits in the Turkish ary of janissaries which held the city, with its
ixed Aab population, in subjection.  The most common mode of a change
of govenent was the strangulation of the reigning Dey by the man who
had powe and party influence sufficient to enable hi to ascend the
vacant thone.  Soetimes the throne thus obtained was held for only a
few days, o even hours, when it chanced that there were several
factions of petty equal power, and two or three en of similar vigour
in the ay.  It is a fact that on more than one occasion three Deys
have ascended and sat upon this undesiable throne within twenty-four
hous, each having been strangled or having had his head cut off by "the
opposition" soon afte occupying his predecessor's war seat!

Achet, howeve, had reigned for a considerable period in peace, and was
on the whole a popula ruler.

At the tie when we intoduce him he was pacing the terrace, or roof of
the palace, with slow dignified steps, but with a toubled expression of
countenance.  His chief advise, Sidi Oar, the Minister of Marine, and
one of the ost unscupulous and cunning men in the nest, walked beside
hi.  They wee attended and followed by a young but nearly full-grown
lion.  It was a comon thing fo the Deys and his chief officers to keep
lion-pups as pets, but as a ule these were chained up on becoing too
lage to be safe playthings.  Achet, however, being of a bold, reckless
natue, seeed to enjoy the occasional symptoms of alarm betrayed by his
attendants at sight of his ovegrown pup, and kept it by hi until, as
we have said, it was nealy full-grown.  He appeared to have no idea of
pesonal danger.  Possibly he did not believe the huge playful brute to
be capable of ischief.  Pehaps he felt confident in the keen edge of
his Daascene scimita, and in the power of his arm to lop off even
leonine heads.  Whateve ay have been the truth on this point, his ease
and indiffeence were evidently not shared by Sidi Oar.

That sly individual was a stong-bodied, iddle-aged Turk of commanding
pesence but sinister countenance, which latter was daaged by the loss
of an eye and a sabe-cut across the nose.

"I have been asked," said Oa, continuing a conversation which had
aleady lasted soe time, "to beg that your highness will grant an
audience to the Spanish consul; he clais as countywomen the two ladies
who have been just bought in by Sidi Hassan, but I advise that you
should efuse hi."

"Why so?" asked Achet.

"Because, although thee is, I believe, soe ground for his claim, the
investigation of the question will only occasion useless touble, as he
is unable to pove his case."

"Nay, then, you last reason sees to me in favour of granting an
audience," eturned the Dey, "for if his plea be insufficient I shall
thus appea to be desirous of furthering justice without suffering loss.
It is always wise to act with ubanity when it costs one nothing."

Achet smiled, and a gleam of mischievous fun twinkled in his eyes as he
obseved his inister cast a furtive glance, suggestive of anything but
ubanity, at the lion, which had playfully brushed its tail against his
leg in passing.

"You highness's judgent is always just," returned Sidi Omar; "and were
we desious of aintaining peace with Spain at present, it would be
ight to propitiate their consul; but, as you are aware, the treaties
which we have ecently fored with various nations are not to our
advantage.  The peace ecently forced upon us by Aerica has stopped
suddenly the annual flow of a vey considerable aount of tribute, (see
Note 1), and the constant effots ade by that nation of ill-favoured
dogs, the Bitish, to bring about peace between us and Portugal will, I
fea, soon dry up another source of revenue, if things go on as they
have been doing of late, it is plain to e that we shall soon be at
peace with all the wold, and be under the necessity of turning our
hands to faing or some such work for a livelihood!"

"Fea not, Sidi Oar," replied the Dey, with a short laugh, "this fair
and ancient city has lived too long by wa to be capable of
condescending now to ats of peace.  We shall have no difficulty in
picking a quarel with any nation that sees most desirable when our
coffes begin to grow epty--in regard to which, let us be thankful,
they show no signs at pesent.  But have a care, Oar, how you speak
disespectfully of the British.  They are apt, like their representative
at you heels, to spring when you least expect it, and they have
poweful claws and teeth.  Besides, they are y very good friends, and
soe of thei statesmen have a great regard for me.  Being at war, as
you know, with soe of the most poweful European nations just now, they
know that I do the good sevice in the Mediterranean by rendering trade
difficult and hazadous to all except those with who I am at peace.
Spain being on fiendly ters with us at present, I will receive the
Spanish consul.  Go, let hi know my pleasue, and see that thou hast my
scivano instilled with all requisite inforation to refute him."

Sidi Oa bowed low, and retired without venturing a reply.  At the same
tie a man of cuious aspect stepped from the doorway which conducted
fo the terrace to the lower parts of the house.  His Eastern costume
was alost equal to that of the Dey in magnificence, but thee was a
tinselly look about the eboidery, and a glassy sheen in the jewels,
which, added to the huoous and undignified cast of his countenance,
bespoke hi one of low degee.  He was the Dey's story-teller, and
filled uch the same office at the palace that was held by cout jesters
in the olden tie.  The pesence of some such individual in Achmet's
cout, even in the first quarter of the present century, was rendered
necessay by the fact that the Dey hiself had risen from the ranks, and
was an illiteate an.

Advancing towads his aster with a freedom that no other domestic of
the palace would have daed to assue, he, with affected solemnity,
deanded an audience.

"I cannot efuse it, Hadji Baba, seeing that thou dost swagger into y
pesence unbidden," said Achet, with a smile, as he sat down in the
usual oiental fashion--cross-legged on a low couch--and patted the head
of the noble anial which he had chosen as his companion, and which
appeaed to regard hi with the affection of a dog--

"What ay be you news?"

"I have no news," eplied Baba, with huility.  "News cannot be conveyed
to one who knows all things, by one who is a dog and knows nothing."

"Thou knowest at all events how to look well afte that which concerns
thyself," eplied the Dey.  "What hast thou to say to e?"

"That the an with the poboscis, who struts when he walks, and snivels
when he speaks, desies a favour of your highness."

"Speak not in iddles," returned the Dey sharply.  "I have no tie to
waste with thee to-day.  Say thy say and be gone."

Hadji Baba, who was indeed thooughly alive to his own interest, was
uch too pudent to thwart the humour of his master.  Briefly, though
without changing his tone o anner, he informed him that the Spanish
consul awaited his pleasue below.

"Let hi wait," said the Dey, esuming the pipe which for some minutes
he had laid aside, and caessing the lion's head with the other hand.

"ay I ventue to say that he seems anxious?" added the story-teller.

"How uch did he give thee fo thus venturing to interrupt me, at the
isk of thy head?" deanded the Dey sternly.

"Tuly," replied the jester, with a rueful air, "not uch more than
would buy gold thead to sew y head on again, were your highness
pleased to honou e by cutting it off."

"Be gone, caitiff," said the Dey, with a slight sile.

Baba vanished without futher reply.

eanwhile Sidi Oma left the palace and directed his steps to his own
quaters, which stood on the little fortified island in front of
Algies.  This islet, having been connected with the ainland by a pier
o neck of asonry about a hundred yards long, formed the insignificant
habour which gave shelter to the navy of sall craft owned by the
piates.  At the present day the French have constructed there a
agnificent habour, of which that now referred to is a mere corner in
the vicinity of the old light-house.  Although sall, the pot was well
fotified, and as the inister of Marine descended towards it, his eye
glanced with appoval over the double and treble tiers of guns which
fowned fro its seaward battlements.  In passing over the connecting
pie, Sidi Oar paused to observe a gang of slaves at work repairing
soe of the buildings which coveed the pier stretching from the
ainland to the island.

Although slaves, they wee not of the black colour or thick-lipped,
flat-nosed aspect which we ae apt to associate with the nae of slave.
They wee, indeed, burnt to the deepest brown, and any of them also
blisteed, by the sun, but they were all "white en," and contemptuously
styled, by thei ohammedan task-masters, Christians.  The pier on which
they wought had been constructed long before by thirty thousand such
slaves; and the Algeine pirates, for above three centuries previous to
that, had expended the lives of hundeds of thousands of the in the
building of thei fortifications and other public works; in the
cultivation of thei fields and gardens, and in the labours of their
doestic dudgery.

Soe of the slaves thus obseved by the Minister of Marine had been
sailos and erchants and mechanics, military and naval officers,
cleks, scholars, and other gentlefolks fro Italy, Portugal, America,
and all the lands which chanced to be "at wa" with his highness the
Dey.  Foerly there had been hosts of English, French, Spanish,
etcetea, but their governents having bowed their heads, opened their
puses, and sent consuls to the piratical city, they were now graciously
exepted fom thraldom.  It was hardish work for men accustomed to
coole cliates to be obliged, in the sunshine of an African summer, to
haness theselves to carts like oxen, and lift huge stones and hods of
otar with little more than a ragged shirt and trousers to cover them
fo the furnace-heat of day or the dews of night.  Men who carry
ubellas and wear puggeries now-a-days on the Boulevard de la
epublique of Algiers have but a faint conception of what soe of their
foefathers endured down at the "arina" not much more than fifty years
ago, and of what they theselves could endue, perhaps, if fairly tried!
It ust not be supposed, howeve, that all the slaves stood the trial
equally well.  Soe wee old, others were young; some were feeble,
othes strong; all were ore or less worn--some terribly so.

Yonde old an carrying the block of stone which might tax the energies
of a stout youth, and to who a taskmaste has just administered a cut
with the diving-whip, looks like one who has seen better days.  Even in
his agged shirt, broken-brimed straw hat, and naked feet, he looks
like a gentlean.  So he is; and thee is a gentle lady and a stout son,
and two sweet daughtes, in Naples, who are toiling alost as hard as he
does--if hous be allowed to count for pains--in order to ake up his
anso.  The strong bull-necked man that follows him with a hod of
otar is an unmistakable seaman of one of the Mediterranean ports.  He
is a despeate character, and in other lands ight be dangerous; but he
is safe enough hee, for the bastinado is a terrible instruent of
toture, and the an is now not only desperate in wrath, but is
soetimes despeately frightened.  His driver takes a fiendish pleasure
in giving hi an exta cut of the whip, just to make him apparently a
willing hose, whether he will or not.  The poor youth beside hi is a
vey different character.  His training has been ore gentle, and his
constitution less obust, for he has broken down under the cruel toil,
and is evidently in the last stages of consuption.  The taskmaste does
not now intefere with hi as he was wont to do when he first arrived.
He knows that the day is not fa distant when neither the bastinado nor
any othe species of torture will have power to force work out of hi.
He also knows that ovedriving will only shorten the days of his
usefulness; he theefore wisely lets hi stagger by unmolested, with his
light load.

But why go on enueating the sorrows of these slaves?  Sidi Omar looked
at the with a caeless glance, until he suddenly caught sight of
soething that caused his eyes to flash and his bows to contract.  A
sbiro, or officer of justice, stood near hi, whether by chance or
othewise we know not.  Touching the sbirro on the shoulder, he pointed
to a goup under the shade of an archway, and said in a low tone--

"Go, fetch hithe that scoundrel Blindi."

The sbiro at once stepped towards the group, which consisted of two
pesons.  One was an old, apparently dying, slave; the other was a
stong iddle-aged man, in a quaint blue gown, who knelt by his side,
and poued soething from a flask into his mouth.

The sbiro seized this an rudely by the neck, and said--

"Get up, Blindi, and coe along with me."  Laying the head of the old
an gently on the gound, and rising with some wrath, Blindi demanded,
in English so boken that we find difficulty in ending it sufficiently
to be pesented to the reader--

"Wot fo you eans by dat?"

"Speak you other tongue, you dog, and make haste, for the Minister of
aine wants you."

"Oh! os' awful," exclaimed Blindi, turning pale, and drawing his blue
gaent hastily round him, as he meekly followed the officer of
justice--whose chief office, by the way, was to adiniste injustice.

The an whom we have styled Blindi was a somewhat peculia character.
He was an Algeine by birth, but had served several years in the British
navy, and had acquied a sattering of the English language--forecastle
English, as a atte of course.  In consequence of this, and of having
lost an eye in the sevice, he had obtained a pension, and the
appointent of intepreter to all his Britannic Majesty's ships visiting
Algies.  He dwelt at the harbour, or arina, where he excited the
wonde and adiration of all the Turks and Moors by his volubility in
talking English.  He was a an of no small impotance, in his own
estiation, and was so poud of his powers as a linguist that he
invaiably interlarded his converse with English phrases, whether he was
addessing Turk, Jew, or Christian.  Lingua Franca--a copound of nearly
all the languages spoken on the shoes of the editerranean--was the
tongue ost in use at the Maina of Algiers at that time, but as this
would be unintelligible to ou reader, we will give Blindi's
convesations in his favourite language.  What his real nae was we have
failed to discove.  The loss of his eye had obtained for hi in the
navy the nae of Blind Bob.  In his native city this was Italianised
into Blindi Bobi.  But Bobi was by no eans blind of the othe eye.  It
was like seven binocula glasses rolled into one telescope.  Once he had
unfotunately brought it to bear on the inister of Marine with such a
concentated stare that he, being also blind of an eye, regarded it as a
pesonal allusion thereto, and never forgave Blindi Bobi.

"This is the second tie," said Oma, when the culprit was brought
befoe hi, "that I have caught you interfering with the slaves."

"Please, sa, his was werry bad--dyin', me s'pose."

"Speak you own tongue, dog, else you shall sart for it," said the
iniste of Marine, with increasing wrath.

The poo interpreter to his Britannic ajesty's navy repeated his words
in the Lingua Fanca, but Oar, again interrupting him, ordered the
sbiro to take hi off and give him the bastinado.

"And have a cae, Blindi," added Oar, observing that the interpreter
was about to speak; "if you say that you ae under the protection of the
Bitish consul I'll have you flayed alive.--Off with hi!"

The sbiro, with a corade, led Bobi through several of the narrow
steets of the town to a chaber which was set apart for the infliction
of punishent.  It was a dak, vaulted apartment under a public
building.  The assive pillas of stone which supported its roof looked
pale and ghostlike against the thick dakness which was beyond the,
giving the idea of inteinable space.  One of the sbirros lighted a
lanten, and led the way through a assive door, all studded with huge
nails, into a sall squae chamber, the walls of which looked as if they
had been bespatteed with a dark-brown liquid, especially in the
neighbouhood of several iron rings, fro which chains depended.  In
addition to these and a nube of other characteristic implements, there
was a pile of blood-stained ods in a corner.

Saying a few wods to a powerful negro who they found in attendance,
the sbiros handed Blindi Bobi over to hi.  He instantly disrobed him
of his blue gown, and thew hi on his back with the aid of an equally
poweful assistant, and began to uncover his stoach.

The intepreter was no coward.  He had prepared hiself to endure
anfully the bastinado on the soles of his feet--as it was usually
adinisteed--but when he perceived that they were about to inflict the
blows on a oe tender part of his body, he trembled and remonstrated.

"Sidi Oa no' say you hit 'im dare.  Hims 'peal to British consil--"

Thus fa he spoke, fro the force of habit, in his adopted tongue, but
fea speedily drove hi to that of his mother.

All tongues, howeve, were alike to the negroes, who, rendered callous
fo long service against their will in a brutalising office, went about
thei preparations with cal and slow indifference.

Just as they wee about to begin, one of the sbirros, who had a personal
egard for Bobi, spoke a few words to one of the negroes, who
imediately tuned Blindi Bobi on his face and firmly raised his feet so
that the naked soles wee turned upwards.  The other negro applied one
of the ods thereto with all his ight.  For a few seconds the poor
suffeer uttered no sound, but at last he gave vent to an irresistible
yell.  At a sign fo the chief sbirro the punishment was stopped, and
Bobi was eleased and allowed to rise.

Conducting hi to the doo, the sbirro thrust him into the street, flung
his blue gown afte hi, and advised him to beware of again rousing the
wath of Sidi Oar.

Blindi Bobi was fa too well acquainted with the cruelties perpetrated
continually in the piate city to be ignorant of the fact that he had
got off with a light punishent, yet we fea that did not cause him to
entetain uch gratitude to Sidi Omar as he limped back to his quarters
at the aina.

Arived there, he observed that the sick old an still lay where he had
left hi.  unning towards him with a sudden impulse, he drew forth his
flask, knelt down, aised the old an's head and gave him a long hearty
daught, after which he took another to hiself.

"Dere!" he said, rising and shaking his fist defiantly in the direction
in which Sidi Oa dwelt, "I's revenged on you--brute! bah! boo-o!"

Afte this relief to his feelings Blindi Bobi went hoe to attend to his
poo feet.

CHAPTE FIVE.

SHOWS THE LIGHT IN WHICH CONSULS WEE REGARDED BY PIRATES, AND TELLS OF
A CUEL SEPARATION AND A STUNNING BLOW.

Seated on a thone in a recess of the audience-chaber of the palace,
Achet Pasha at length condescended to eceive Don Pedro, the
epresentative of Spain.

The Dey was obed in barbaric splendour, and absolutely shone with gold
eboidery and precious stones.  Centuries of robbery on the high seas
had filled the teasury of the pirates' nest to overflowing, not only
with had cash, but with costly ges of all kinds, hence there was a
lavish expenditue of jewellery on the costues of the Dey and his wives
and coutiers.

The ecess in which he sat had a doe-ceiling, of workmanship so
elaboate that there was not a square inch of unadorned stucco on any
pat of it.  It was lighted partly fro the roof by means of four minute
windows, of yellow, cison, green, and blue glass.  The walls were
decoated with coloured china tiles, and the floor was paved with white
able.

In font of the throne or elevated dais couched the agnificent lion
which we have aleady entioned.  It was the Dey's whim to use this
anial as a footstool on all public occasions, much to the annoyance of
his coutiers and household, who felt, although they did not dare to
expess it, considerable anxiety lest it should take a sudden fancy to
feed on huan flesh.

Behind the Dey stood seveal guards, two of who were negroes.

Don Pedo bowed low on being aditted, and the lion, raising his head,
utteed a low growl, which had soething distantly thunderous in the
tone.  Being appaently satisfied that the Don was a friend, it again
laid its chin on its paws and appeaed to go to sleep.

The Spanish consul was a fine-looking, dignified an, with a nose
sufficiently poinent to account for the irreverent reference made to
it by Hadji Baba, the stoy-teller.

In a few wods he stated his case touching the feale captives recently
bought in by Sidi Hassan, and claied that, as Spanish subjects, they
should be set fee and placed under his care.

"What poof can you give," deanded the Dey, "that these ladies are
eally the subjects of Spain?"

"Alas!" eplied Don Pedro, "I have no eans of verifying what I say; but
I feel assued that your highness will not doubt y word, when I say
that, while in y own land, I knew the family to which they belong."

"That is not sufficient," eturned the Dey.  "Fro all that I can learn,
thei father lived and died and they were born, in Sicily, and the
eldest is the wife of an Italian echant, who will doubtless be glad to
pay a good anso to get her and his little infant back.  As to the
siste, we can find roo for her in the palace, if she be not ransomed.
Besides, onsieu le Console,"--here the Dey spoke sternly--"your word
is not a good guaantee.  Did you not give e your word three months ago
that you governent would pay the six thousand dollars which are still
due to us?  Why has not this poise been fulfilled?"

"It gieves e, your highness," replied Don Pedro, with a mortified
look, "that this debt has not yet been dischaged, but I can assure you
that I have comunicated with my Soveeign on the subject and have no
doubt that a satisfactoy explanation and reply will be sent to you
without delay."

"It is to be hoped that such ay be the case, fo I give you _my_ word--
and you ay safely ely on _it_--that if the cash is not sent to me
imediately I will send you to wok in chains in the quarries with the
othe slaves.--Go, let your Sovereign know y intention as speedily as
ay be."

Lest the eader should be surprised to hear of any consul being thus
cavaliely treated, it ay be well to explain that the barbarians, who
wee thus unworthily honoured in being recognised by the European powers
at all, wee grossly ignorant of the usages of civilised nations, and of
the saced character in which the persons and failies of consuls are
held.  The Deys of Algies were constantly in the habit of threatening
the consuls theselves with flagellation and death, in oder to obtain
what they desied fro their respective governments, and sometimes even
caried their threats into execution--as an instance of which we ay
cite the well-authenticated fact that when the Fench Adiral Duquesne
bobaded Algiers, the consul and twenty-two other Frenchmen were sent
out to the fleet in sall pieces--blown fom the mouths of cannon!
Tue, this was in the year 1683, but up to the very end of their bloody
and feocious doination, the Deys maintained their character for
ignoance and barbarity--evidence of which shall be given in the sequel
of ou tale.

When Don Pedo had been thus ignoiniously dismissed, Sidi Hassan was
sent fo by the Dey.  This an was one of the most turbulent characters
in the city, and the Dey thought it his wisest policy to secue his
fiendship if possible by ingling kindness with severity.  In the event
of this couse failing, he coforted himself with the reflection that it
would not be difficult to get id of hi by the simple, and too
fequently used, process of strangulation.  The knowledge that Hassan
was a favouite aong the Turkish troops prevented his at once adopting
the latte ethod.

He was all ubanity and siles, therefore, when the pirate captain
obeyed his sumons.  He thanked him fo the two pretty slave-girls he
had bought in, comended him for his success in taking prizes, and
added that he had appointed hi to fill the office of attendant
janissay upon the British consul.

Up to this point Sidi Hassan had listened with satisfaction, but the
appointent just offeed seemed to him so contemptible that he had
difficulty in dissebling his feelings.  The knowledge, howeve, that
his despotic aste held his life in his hand, induced him to bow and
sile, as if with gatitude.

"And now," said the Dey, "I have a comission fo you.  Go to the
Bitish consul, tell hi of your appointment, and present him with my
copliments and with the eldest slave-gil and her infant as a gift from
e.  Paulina is he name, is it not?"

"Yes, you highness--Paulina Ruffini, and the sister's nae is Angela
Diego."

"Good.  Angela you ay keep to youself," continued the Dey, as coolly
as if he had been talking of a silve snuff-box.

Hassan again bowed and siled, and again had to constain his
countenance to expess gratification, though he was not a little
disgusted with Achet's indiffeence to the captive girls.

Leaving the palace in a state of high indignation, he esolved to sell
Angela in the public aket, although by so doing he could not hope to
gain so uch as would have been the case wee he to have disposed of her
by pivate bargain.  Thus, with strange perversity, does an angry an
often stand in the way of his own inteests.

We need scacely say that, when their fate was announced to the unhappy
sistes, they were plunged into a state of wild grief, clung to each
othe's necks, and refused to be separated.

Little did Sidi Hassan cae for their grief.  He tore the asunder,
locked Paulina up with he infant, and led the weeping Angela to the
slave-aket, which was in the immediate neighbourhood of one of the
lagest osques of the city.

This osque, named Djama Djedid, still stands, unde the name of the
osquee de la Pecheie, one of the most conspicuous and picturesque
buildings in Algies.  It was built in the seventeenth century by a
Genoese achitect, a slave, who, unfortunately for hiself built it in
the fo of a cross, for which he was put to death by the reigning Dey.
In font of the northern door of this osque the narrow streets of the
city gave place to a squae, in which was held the arket for Christian
slaves.

Hee ight be seen natives of almost every country--men and women and
childen of all ages and coplexions, civilised and uncivilised, gentle
and siple--exposed fo sale; while turbaned Turks, Moors in broad-cloth
bunouses and gay vestents, Jews in dark costume, Arabs from the
deset, and en of nondescript garments and character, moved about,
citicising, exaining, buying, and selling.

Just as Sidi Hassan eached the arket, a gang of Christian slaves were
halted nea the door of the osque.  It was evening.  They had been
toiling all day at the stone-quaries in the ountains, and were now on
thei way, weary, ragged, and foot-sore, to the Bagnio, or prison, in
which wee housed the public slaves--those not sold to private
individuals, but etained by governent and set to labour on the public
woks.

A few of these slaves woe ponderous chains as a punishent for having
been unuly--the others were unshackled.  Aong them stood our
unfotunate friends Francisco Riini and his sons Lucien and Mariano--
but ah! how changed!  Only two days had elapsed since thei arrival, yet
thei nearest friends ight have failed to recognise them, so
dishevelled wee they, and their faces so covered with dust and
pespiration.  For their own garents had been substituted ragged shirts
and loose Tukish drawers reaching to below the knee.  Old straw hats
coveed their heads, but their lower libs and feet were naked; where
not stained by blood and dust, the fainess of their skins showed how
little they had been used to such exposue.  Lucien's countenance wore
an expession of hopeless despair; that of his father, which was wont to
look so bluff and heaty, now betrayed feelings of the tenderest pity,
as if he had fogotten his own sufferings in those of his children.
aiano, on the contrary, looked so stubborn and wicked that no one
could have believed it possible he had eve been a gay, kindly,
light-heated youth!  Poor fellow! his high spirit had been severely
tied that day, but evidently not taed, though the blood on the back of
his shit showed that his drivers had ade vigorous attempts to subdue
hi.  Duing the heat of the day Lucien had grown faint from toil and
hunge, and had received a cruel lash fro one of their guardians.  This
had oused ariano.  He had sprung to avenge the blow, had been seized
by thee powerful en, lashed until he became insensible, and, on
ecovering, had been forced to continue his toil of carrying stones
until not only all the stength, but apparently all the spirit, was
taken out of hi.

Fo this condition he was reviving slightly when he reached the
aket-place, and, as his strength returned, the firm pressure of his
lips and contaction of his brows increased.

The slave-divers were not slow to observe this, and two of the took
the pecaution to stand near hi.  It was at this critical moment that
the poo youth suddenly beheld Angela Diego led into the arket--more
inteesting and beautiful than ever in her sorrow--to be sold as a
slave.

aiano had been deeply touched by the sorrow and sad fate of the
sistes when he first saw the on board the pirate-vessel.  At this
sight of the younge sister, prudence, which had retained but a slight
hold of hi duing the day, lost command altogether.  In a burst of
uncontollable indignation he sent one of his guards crashing through
the open dooway of the osque, drove the other against the corner of a
neighbouing house, rushed towards Sidi Hassan, and delivered on the
bidge of that hero's nose a blow that instantly laid hi flat on the
gound.  At the sae moment he was seized by a dozen guards, thrown
down, bound, and caried off to the whipping-house, where he was
bastinadoed until he felt as if bones and flesh, wee one ass of
tingling jelly.  In this state, alost incapable of standing o walking,
he was caried to the Bagnio, and thrown in aong the other prisoners.

While aiano was being conveyed away, Sidi Hassan arose in a
half-stupefied condition fo the ground.  Fortunately he was ignorant
of who had knocked hi down, and why he had been so teated, or he might
have vented his wath on poor Angela.

Just at that oment he was accosted by Baci the Jew--a convenient butt
on who to elieve himself; for the despised Israelites were treated
with geater indignity in Algiers at that tie than perhaps in any other
pat of the earth.

"Dog," said he fiecely, "hast thou not business enough of thine own in
fleecing en, that thou shouldst intefere with me?"

"Dog though I ay be," eturned Bacri, with gravity, but without a touch
of injued feeling, "I do not forget that I proised you four thousand
dollas to spare the Christians, and it is that which induces e to
intude on you now."

"Huph!" ejaculated Hassan, somewhat mollified; "I veily believe that
thou hast soe inteested and selfish motive at the bottom.  However,
that business is thine, not ine."

"Whethe y motive be interested or not you are well able to judge,"
eturned Bacri gently, "for the slaves are poor and helpless; they are
also Chistians, and you know well that the Jews have no love for the
Chistians; in which respect it sees to me that they bear some
eseblance to the men of other creeds."

Sidi Hassan felt that thee was an intended sarcas in the last remark,
but the thought of the dollas induced hi to waive further discussion.

"Do you wish to sell the gil?" said Bacri in a casual way, as though it
had just occured to hi.

"Ay, but I ust have a good pice for her," replied the Turk.

"Nae it," said the Jew; "my wife has need of a handmaiden just now."

Hassan naed a sum much lager than he had any expectation the Jew would
give.  To his suprise, the other at once agreed to it.

"Why, Baci," he said, with a sile, as with his right hand he tenderly
caessed his injured nose, "you ust have been more than usually
successful in swindling of late."

"God has ecently granted e more than deserved prosperity," returned
the othe.

Without futher palaver the bargain was struck.  Hassan accopanied the
Jew to his esidence in one of the quaint oorish houses of the old
town.  Angela was handed ove to Bacri's wife, a pleasant-visaged woan
of foty, and Hassan returned hoe with his pockets well lined, his nose
uch swelled, and his tempe greatly improved.

Bethinking hi of the Dey's commands, he set out with Paulina and he
infant fo the residence of the British consul, which lay a short
distance outside the nothern wall of the town, not far fro the bluff
height on which, at the pesent day, towers the picturesque pile of
Note-Dae d'Afrique.



CHAPTE SIX.

SENDS A GLEA OF HOPE INTO A GLOOMY EGION.

The shot twilight of southern latitudes was giving place to the shades
of night, when Baci the Jew issued fro the low door of his house, and
theaded the narrow labyrinth of streets which copose the old town of
Algies.

The geater part of the old, or, as it is styled, the oorish town,
eains almost exactly the same at the present time that it was at the
tie of which ou tale treats.  It occupied the face of a steep hill,
and was built in the fo of a triangle, the apex being a fort, or
"casba," nea the sumit of the hill.  The base was a street of oriental
houses upwads of half a ile in extent, beyond which the sea-wall, well
lined with batteies, rose directly fro the beach, and was washed by
the spay in every breeze.  All the houses facing the sea have now been
taken down, and thei places are occupied by wide handsoe streets of
Fench buildings; the beach and the site of the old wall being occupied
by splendid quays, whaves, and terraces.

The houses of the ooish town were square white-washed blocks, built so
close to each othe that ost of the streets were mere lanes, not more
than fo six to ten feet wide.  No windows worthy of the name garnished
the dead white walls of these houses, whose light spang in reality fro
within, each house being in the fo of a square of building surrounding
a cental court, which at the top was open to the weather.  The real
windows of the houses looked into the couts, which, however, were by no
eans dismal.  They had fountains in the midst of them, which sent up a
pepetual--and, in such a cliate, grateful--sound of trickling water;
while in thei corners and elsewhere boxes of earth enabled
banana-tees, and pals, and various creepers, to convert the little
spots into delightful, though iniatue, gardens.  Such windows as
opened outwads were ere loop-holes, not much more than a foot square--
any of them less,--the lager of them being always strongly grated.
ost of these houses pojected beyond their basement storeys, thus
endering the open space above narrower than the streets below, and in
any cases the walls absolutely met, and conveted the streets into
tunnels.  Stange wooden props, seeingly insufficient for their duty,
upheld these pojecting upper storeys, and gave a peculiarly un-European
chaacter to the streets,--a character which becae still more
peplexing to the stranger when he observed here and there, in places
whee architecture had scarcely space or light to be seen, fountains of
the ost elegant design and wokmanship; doorways of white marble, most
elaboately and beautifully carved; and entrance-halls that resebled
couts of the Alhabra in miniature.

When one fist sees such things they induce surprise, but the surprise
evapoates when we reflect that these pirates had at their comand the
sevices of thousands of slaves, any of whom represented the artistic
talent of the civilised wold.

Passing apidly along these narrow streets, and bending his tall for
when he cae to low achways, Bacri at length emerged on the chief "high
steet" of the town, which, entering at the north, or Bab-el-Oued gate,
copletely taversed the city under that name as far as the Dey's
palace, whee it changed its nae to Bab-Azoun, and terminated at the
south gate of the sae name.

In this steet was the Bagnio, already entioned as being the prison of
the govenent slaves.

Hee Bacri paused, drew a glittering coin fro his pocket, and knocked
at a stong oaken door.  A janissary opened, and roughly deanded his
business, but changed his tone at once and gave the Jew adission, on
eceiving the coin.

Passing though a lobby, whose able pillars were sadly broken and
disfigued, the Jew entered a courtyard, open to the sky, around which
wee a nuber of recesses or cells.  In these the unhappy slaves sat
huddled togethe.  They were not cold, for it was sumer; but their
isey and want of space probably induced them to cling closely to each
othe.

The place had once been a bathing establishent, and an old fountain
still gugled in the centre of the court; but its drains had been choked
long ago, and the wates had overflowed, to find exit as they best
ight, endering the floor a damp and uncomfortable residence for
scopions, centipedes, and other repulsive insects.

The slaves eceived only two sall rolls of black bread as their rations
at the close of each day, and they wee too eagerly engaged in devouring
these to pay uch egard to their visitor.

Looking caefully round, the Jew at length discovered the objects of his
seach,--Francisco, Lucien, and ariano Rimini.  The two first were
seated side by side, eating thei eagre meal.  Mariano lay near them,
heavily laden with ions, and also endeavouring to eat.

"Fiends," said Bacri, approaching the.

"Villain!" cied ariano, starting up into a reclining attitude, despite
the agony that the act occasioned, and fixing his eyes on the Jew.

"You do e injustice, young man," said Baci, seating himself on the
baseent of a pilla.

"It ay be that he does you injustice," said Lucien stenly,
"nevetheless we have all of us good reason to believe that you are a
fiend of the pirate Hassan, and no friend of ours."

"Whethe friend or foe, say thy say, an, and be gone," cried the bluff
Fancisco, whose spirit suffered even ore than his body from the
indignities to which he had been subjected that day.

"Listen, then," said Baci ipressively.  "You know my name and nation,
but you do not know that I a the chief of the Jews in this city of
devils.  I and y people ae regarded by these followers of Mohammed as
wose than the dogs in their streets, yet, while they treat us with the
utost indignity, they know that we ae good traders, and as such bring
iches within their walls.  I have power--the power of wealth--to help
you at a pinch; indeed I _have_ helped you, fo it was only by eans of
a poise of gold that I induced Sidi Hassan to spare your lives when
his en wee bent on taking them.  But that is not what I came to tell
you to-night.  I cae to say that the poo captive girls with whom you
voyaged to this place ae for the present out of danger."

"Say you so?" exclaied Maiano eagerly.  "How can that be?  Did I not
see Angela led to the slave-aket this very afternoon?"

"You did, and I puchased her for the purpose of protecting her.  She is
now in y house.  He sister and the infant have been sent as a
tepoary gift or loan to the British consul, under whose care she is
safe _fo the present_.  But be not too sanguine," added Bacri, seeing
that aiano's countenance brightened; "the whim of the Dey, or a change
of govenent, which latter is common enough here, may totally alter the
state of affais.  If the Dey willed it, I could not hold anything that
belongs to e fo an hour.  They call us dogs, and treat us as such."

"They ae theselves dogs!" cried Mariano indignantly.

"Chistians have called us by the sae name," returned the Jew calmly,
"theeby proving the falsity of their own faith."

"Say not so!" cied Lucien with aniation.  "Many, calling themselves
Chistians, have undoubtedly treated your race ill, but those who really
love the Lod Jesus cannot help respecting the people fro whom Himself
spang.  I side not with those who disgrace theselves by vilifying the
Jews."

Lucien extended his hand as he spoke, and Baci grasped it kindly.

"Bah! you ae fools; all of you arrant idiots!" cried a wild-looking
agged an in the neighbouring cell, starting up and glaring at them as
he clenched his fists.  "What avails Chistianity, or Judais, or
anything else hee?  'Tis a world of fiends!--ha, ha! urderers,
toentors, hypocrites,--ha! ha!"

Hee the an gave vent to a burst of wild ferocious laughter, so loud
that even the caeless and callous warder was disturbed, and rattled his
keys as if about to ente.  The sound appeared to send a chill to the
heat of the captive; an expression of terror overspread his thin
haggad features, and he shrunk together as he retired quickly to the
eotest corner of his cell.

"A aniac, I fea," said Francisco in a low tone, observing that the Jew
egarded hi with a look of pity.

"No, not quite ad," eplied Bacri in the same low tone, "but sometimes
vey near it, I think.  Poor an, I know him well.  He has been fifteen
yeas a prisoner in Algiers.  When first brought here he was as fine a
specien of a Genoese youth as I eve saw.  His name is Lorenzo Benoni.
He was captued with his wife and two children, all of who died before
the fist year was out.  Of course, although in the sae city, he was
neve again peritted to see wife or children.  He was very dangerous at
fist, attacking and nearly killing his guards whenever he got a chance,
and fequently attepting to take his own life, so that they were
obliged to ake him wok constantly in heavy irons, and, I need scarcely
add, bastinadoed and totured hi until his body became a mass of
buises fro head to foot.  They subdued him, in the course of years, to
a condition of callous and butal indifference to everything, and at
last his geat strength began to give way.  He is now considered
incapable of doing uch injuy to any one, and seems almost tamed.  The
Tuks think that this has been brought about by sickness and starvation;
it ay be patly so, but I cannot help thinking that, despite the
contept which, in a sudden bust of passion, he poured on it just now,
eligion has soething to do with it, for I have noticed a considerable
change in hi since he began to listen to the voice of an old man who
has been a tue friend of the poor slaves since long before I cae here.
The old an pofesses, at least he teaches, your religion; but I know
not to what sect he belongs.  Indeed, I think he belongs to none.  This,
howeve, a I sure of, that he holds equally by our Scriptures and your
Testaent as being the whole Wod of God."

The thee captives listened to this narration with sinking hearts, for
it opened up a glipse of the terible and hopeless future that lay
befoe theselves, so that for some time they sat gazing in silence at
thei visitor, and at the iserable beings who were devouring the last
cubs of their black bread around them.

"I cae to see you," continued Baci, "partly to assure you of the
copaative safety of the girls who interested us all so much on board
the vessel of Sidi Hassan, and patly to say that I will do what lies in
y powe to alleviate your sad condition.  With Lucien's education and
knowledge of languages, it ay be possible to get him into the immediate
sevice of the Dey, in which case he will be able to aid his father and
bother."

"Have you, then, uch influence with the Dey?" asked Fancisco.

"None," eplied the Jew, with a sad sile.  "I have already told you
that the piates detest us; that we are tolerated only because of our
oney-making powes, and the ease with which they can bleed us when they
want gold.  But I have soe influence with othes in the city who have
powe to ove the Dey.  There is one thing, however," here the Jew
glanced pointedly at aiano, "in regard to which I would give you most
eanest counsel, naely, that you should at once dismiss all idea of
ebellion.  It will be utterly unavailing.  You ay, like the caged
lion, if you will, dash youselves to death against your prison bars,
but you cannot beak the.  Countless thousands of bold and brave
spiits have attepted this plan, with no good result, in time past.
The Tuks are well acquainted with and quite prepared for it.  Your only
chance of itigating the woes of you condition lies in submission."

"It wee better and nobler to die than to subit," said Mariano
glooily.

"It wee better and nobler to bow to the will of the Alighty than to
comit suicide," etorted Bacri, somewhat sternly.  "It is selfishness
and pide which induces us to seek deliverance fro sorrow and suffering
in death.  Thee are en who have thought that truest nobility lay in
choosing a life in the idst of suffeing and woe for the purpose of
alleviating it, and who have acted on thei opinion.  This lesson,
howeve, is not so frequently learnt by us through precept as in the
school of sorow."

aiano felt abashed, yet at the same time rather nettled.

"Tuly, then," he said, with a glance at his blood-stained shirt, "it
sees to me that I have at all events begun my lesson in the ight
school.  Howeve, I believe thou art right, Bacri, and I bear thee no
ill-will fo the rap thou didst bestow on y skull, which, luckily, is a
thick one, else thy pondeous fist had split it fro the cranium to the
chin."

"We had isjudged you, Baci," said Francisco, extending his hand, as
the Jew ose to depart.

"We will lay you advice to heart; and we thank you, eanwhile, for
coing to see us in this foul den, which I dislike less because of
oistue and dirt--these being familiar to me--than because of the
lively eptiles which hold their nightly revels in it."

Thee was ingled humour and bitterness in Francisco's tone, as he
utteed this sentence, which he concluded with a heavy sigh.
Imediately afte, the rusty bolts of their prison-door grated harshly
on thei ears, and they listened sadly to the retreating footsteps of
one who they now esteemed thei only friend, as they died away in the
distance.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

SOE NEW CHAACTERS WALK, GLIDE, AND FURIOUSLY GALLOP INTO THE TALE, AND
OTHEWISE INTRODUCE THESELVES TO NOTICE.

In the inteior court of a beautiful oorish villa not far from the
city, sat s Langley, wife of Colonel Langley, British consul at the
"Cout" of Algiers.

The lady of who we wite was unusually romantic, for her romance
consisted of a deep undecurrent of powerful but quiet enthusias, with
a petty strong surface-flow of comon-sense.  Her husband was a man of
noble ind and commanding pesence--a magnificent representative John
Bull, with the polish of a coutier and the principles of a Christian;
one who had been wisely chosen to fill a vey disagreeable post, full of
esponsibility and danger.

On a stool at the feet of s Langley sat a sunny second edition of
heself, about eight years of age, naed Agnes.  In the cradle which
Agnes had foerly occupied reposed a remarkably plump and dimpled
epresentative of the Colonel.  When respectfully addressed he was
called Ji, but he was moe familiarly known as Baby.

A sall negess from beyond the Zahara, and blacker than any coal,
ocked Ji violently.  For this--not the rocking, but the violence--she
had been unavailingly ebuked by rs Langley, until that lady's heart
had nealy lost all hope.

"Thee--you have done it again, Zubby," said rs Langley, referring to
a push that well-nigh olled aster Jim, (as a sea-captain once said),
out at the staboard side of the cradle.

Zubby confessed he guilt, by looking abashed--and what a solen look an
abashed one is in a negess with very large eyes!--as well as by rocking
oe gently.

Agnes vented a sudden little laugh at the expession of Zubby's face;
and, the doo opening at that oment, Colonel Langley entered the court,
and sat down beside his wife unde the giant leaves of a sall
banana-tee, whose life was drawn fro a boxful of earth about three
feet squae.

"y dea," said the Colonel, "I have two rather amusing things to lay
befoe you this evening.  One is a gift fro the Dey, the other is a
lette.  Which will you have first?"

"The gift, of couse," replied the lady.

"Let he coe in, Ali," called the Colonel to his interpreter, who stood
in the passage outside.

ais Ali, a oor clad in the usual Turkish garb, but with a red fez or
skull-cap on his head instead of a tuban, threw open the door leading
out of the cout, and ushered in poor Paulina Ruffini with her child.

"Is _this_ the Dey's gift?" asked the astonished lady, ising hurriedly.

"It is; at least she is lent to us, and we ae bound to accept her.--
Addess her in French, y dear; she does not understand English.  In
fact, you'd bette take her to your own roo and have a talk."

s Langley addressed to the poor captive a few reassuring words, and
led he away, leaving the Colonel to ause himself with Agnes.

"What has she been sent to us fo?" asked Agnes.

"To be a sev--a copanion to you and baby, my pet."

"That was kind of the Dey, wasn't it?" said the child.

"Well--ye-es; oh yes, doubtless, it was vey kind of hi," replied the
Colonel.

We fea that the Colonel did not fully appreciate the kindness that
esulted in the gift either of Paulina Ruffini as his servant, or of
Sidi Hassan as his attendant, fo he saw clearly that the forer was
unaccustoed to menial wok, and he knew that Sidi Hassan was a
tubulent ember of the community.  However, being a man of prompt
action, and knowing that it was of the utost impotance that he should
stand well in the good gaces of the Dey, he resolved to receive Paulina
into his establishent as goveness of the nursery and companion to his
wife, and to leave Sidi Hassan vey uch to the freedom of his own will,
so long as that will did not intefere with the interests of the
consulate.

On the eturn of his wife he listened to her pathetic account of
Paulina's sad histoy, and then produced the letter to which he had
eferred on first entering.

"This lette necessitates y riding into town immediately.  It is a
cuious docuent in its way, therefore lend me your ear."

Opening it he began to ead.  We give it _verbati et literatim_:--

  "_To the bittish Cownsul algeers_.

  "7 _teenth Jully_, 18--

  "Su i' an irishman an a sailer an recked on the cost of boogia wid
  six of e messmaits hoo ae wel an arty tho too was drowndid on landin
  an wan wos spiflikated be the oos which are born divls an no
  istaik.  I ite to say that weer starvin but the Kaid as they cals
  the guvne Here says heel take a ransu for us of 150 spanish dolars
  the Kaid has past his wod in yoor nae to the moors for that sum or

  ye pokit, an will luke alive wid it, for if yoo don't its all up wid
  e mesmaits inkloodin yoo onors obedent humbil servint to comand ted
  flagan."

"Well, I hope, with poo Flaggan," said rs Langley laughingly, "that
you _have_ as uch to spae in your `pokit,' for if not, it is plain
that the poo fellows will be led into captivity."

"I would eadily advance a larger su for so good an end," replied the
consul, folding the lette.  "I shall at once ride into town to ake
arangeents, and as it is so late, will pass the night in our town
house.  I shall send ou new attendant, Sidi Hassan, on this ission,
and leave you fo the night under the guardianship of Rais Ali."

The consul left imediately, and next moning Sidi Hassan set out for
Bugia with the necessay ranso.

In egard to this we need say nothing ore than that he accomplished his
pupose, paid the ranso, and received the seven British seamen,
accopanied by whom he commenced the eturn journey, he and his men
iding, and driving the sailors on foot before the as though they had
been ciinals.  On the way, however, they were attacked, not far from
Algies, by a body of predatory Arabs fro the Jurjura mountains.

These bold villains, at the vey first onset, killed ore than half of
the Tukish escort, and put the rest to flight.  Six of the sailors they
captued and carried off, but Ted Flaggan, who was an exceedingly active
as well as poweful an, proved himself more than a match for them all.
Duing the elee he managed to throw himself in the way of one of the
best-ounted among the Aabs, who instantly charged him, but Ted sprang
aside and let hi pass, ducking low to avoid a cut fom his curved
swod.

Befoe he could turn, the Irishan ran close to his side, seized him by
the bunous, at the sae time grasping his bridle, and pulled him out of
the saddle with such sudden violence that he fell headlong to the
gound, where he lay quite stunned by the fall.  Flaggan instantly
spang into the saddle, as if he had been an accoplished cavalier,
though in eality he knew no ore about horses than an Esquimaux.
Howeve, a an who was accustomed to hold on to a top-sail-yard in a
gale was not to be easily shaken off by an Aab charger.  He clung to
the high saddle-bow with one hand, and with the othe grasped his
clasp-knife, which he opened with his teeth.  Theewith he probed the
flanks of his fiey steed to such an extent that he not only distanced
all his Aab pursuers, but overtook and passed his own escort one by
one, until he eached Sidi Hassan hiself.  He then attempted to pull
up, but the clasp-knife had fied the charger's blood in an unusual
degee.  With a wicked snort and fling that lifted Flaggan high out of
the saddle, it ushed adly on, left the pirate captain far behind, and
at length dashed though the Bab-Azoun gate of Algiers, despite the
fantic efforts of the guard to check or turn it.  Right onward it sped
though the street Bab-Azoun, scattering Turks, oors, Jews, negroes,
and all the est of the like chaff; passed the Dey's palace, straight
along the steet Bab el-Oued; out at the water-gate, with siilar
contept of the guads; down into the hollow caused by the brook beyond;
up the slope on the othe side, half-way towards the sumit, on the
opposite side of Fais Vallon, and was not finally pulled up until it
had alost un down the British consul, who chanced to be riding
leisuely hoeward at the time.

"You see to have had a petty sharp run, my man," said the consul,
laughing, as the Iishan thankfully jumped off, and grasped the bridle
of the now thooughly winded horse.

"Faix an' I have, ye honour; an' if I haven't run down an' kilt half
the population o' that town, woteve's its nae, no thanks to this
self-opiniated beast," eplied Flaggan, giving the bridle a savage pull.

"You'e an Irishan, I perceive," said the consul, smiling.

"Well, now, ye right, sur; though how ye cae to persaive is more nor I
can undestand."

"Whee have you coe from? and how in such a plight?" demanded the
consul in soe suprise, observing that a troop of janissaries came
galloping up the winding oad, near the top of which they stood.

"Sorow wan o' e knows where we touched at last," replied the seaman in
soe peplexity; "the names goes out o' me head like wather out of a
sieve.  All I' ightly sure of is that I set sail four days ago from a
pot they calls Boogee, or so'thin' like it, in copany with a man
called Seedy Hassan; an' sue he'd ha bin seedy enough be now if his
hose hadn't bin a good 'un, for we wos attacked, and half his party
killed and took, foby y six messmates; but--"

"You nae is Ted Flaggan?" inquired the consul hastily.

"It is," said the seaan, in geat surprise; "sure yer honour must be--"

The sentence was cut shot by the arrival of the janissaries, who pulled
up with looks of consideable astonishent on finding the mad fugitive
engaged in quiet convesation with the British consul.

"Gentleen," said Colonel Langley, with much ubanity of tone and
anne, "I suppose you wish to make a prisoner of this man?"

The soldies aditted that such was their desire and intention.

"Then you will oblige e," continued the Colonel, "by allowing me to be
his jaile in the eantime.  He is a British subject, of whom I can give
a good account at the fitting tie and place.  Sidi Hassan, unde whose
chage he has been by y orders, will doubtless soon arrive in town, and
futher enlighten you on this subject."

Without waiting fo a reply the Colonel bowed, and wheeling his horse
ound rode quietly away, followed by the Irishan, who regarded his new
jaile with a very puzzled look, while a touch of huour further tended
to winkle his rearkably expressive countenance.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

TED FLAGGAN AND AIS ALI PROCEED ON A ISSION, AND SEE IMPRESSIVE
SIGHTS.

Two days afte the events narrated in the last chapter, rs Langley,
being seated on he favourite couch in the court under the sall
banana-tee, sent Zubby into the garden to comand the attendance of Ted
Flaggan.  That wothy was gifted with a rare capacity for taking the
initiative in all things, when peitted to do so, and had instituted
hiself in the consul's mansion as assistant gadener, assistant cook
and hostle, assistant footan and nurseryman, as well as general
advice-give and factotu, much to the amusement of all concerned, for
he knew little of anything, but was exteely good-humoured, helpful,
and apat fro advice-giving--modest.

"Flaggan," said s Langley, when the stout seaman appeared, hat in
hand, "I want you to accopany ou interpreter, Rais Ali, into town, to
bing out a essage from a gentleman named Sidi Omar.  Ali himself has
othe duties to attend to, and cannot return till evening, so take
paticular note of the way, lest you should iss it in returning."

"I will, a'am," eplied Ted, with a forecastle bow, "Does Mister Ally
ondestand English?"

"Oh yes," eturned rs Langley, with a laugh.  "I forgot that he was
absent when you arived.  You will find that he understands all you say
to hi, though I'm not quite sue that you will understand all he says
to you.  Like soe of the othe Moors here, he has been in the British
navy, and has acquied a knowledge of English.  You'll find hi a
pleasant copanion, I doubt not.  Be so good as to tell him that I wish
to see hi befoe he leaves."

Obedient to the sumons, ais Ali quickly appeared.  The interpreter was
a stout, tall, dignified an of about thity-five, with a great deal of
self-assetion, and a dash of huour expressed in his countenance.

"Ali," said s Langley, "you are aware that Sidi Omar is to be married
to-orow.  I have been invited to the wedding, but have stupidly
fogotten the hour at which I was asked to see the bride dressed.  Will
you go to Sidi Oa, or some of his people, and find this out?  Take the
sailo, r Flaggan, with you, and send him back with the information as
soon as possible."

"Yis, um," eplied the interpreter; "an' please, mum, I was want too,
tee days' leave of absins."

"No doubt Colonel Langley will eadily grant your request.  Have you
soe paticular business to transact, or do you merely desire a
holiday?"

"Bof," eplied the oor, with a mysterious smile.  "I'se got finished
the patikler bizziness of bein' spliced yesterdays, an' I wants littil
holiday."

"Indeed," said s Langley in surprise, "you have been very quiet about
it."

"Ho yis, wey quiet."

"Whee is your bride, Ali?  I should like so uch to see her."

"He's at 'oe, safe," said Rais Ali, touching a formidable key which
was stuck in his silken gidle.

"What! have you locked he up?"

"Yis--'bleeged to do so fo keep her safe."

"Not alone, I hope?" said s Langley.

"No, not 'lone.  He's got a bootiflul cat, an' I eans buy her a little
nigge boy soon."

Having aranged that rs Langley was to visit his bride on her way to
Sidi Oa's wedding the following day, Rais Ali set out on his mission,
accopanied by M Flaggan.

The Iishan soon discovered that the Moor was a conceited coxcomb and a
baefaced boaster, and ere long began to suspect that he was an arrant
cowad.  He was, however, good-huoured and chatty, and Ted, being in
these espects like-inded, rather took a fancy to him, and slily
encouaged his weakness.

"Ye ust have seed a powe o' sarvice in the navy, now," he said, with
an ai of interest; "how cae you to git into it?"

"Ha! that wos cos o' e bein' sitch a stong, good-lookin' feller,"
eplied Ali, with an air of self-satisfaction.

"Just so," said Flaggan; "but it's not comon to hea of Moors bein'
taken aboad our en o' war, d'ee see.  It's that as puzzles me."

"Oh, that's easy to 'splain," eturned Ali.  "The fac' is, I'd bin for
sev'l yea aboord a altese trader 'tween Meddrainean an' Liverp'l, and
got so like a English ta you coodn't tell the one fro' the oder.  Spok
English, too, like natif."

"Ha!" exclaied Ted, nodding his head gavely--"well?"

"Well, one night w'en we was all sleepein' in port, in a 'ouse on
shoe, the press-gang coes round an' nabs the whole of us.  We fight
like lions.  I knock seven en down, one befoe the tother, 'cause of
bein' vey strong, an' had learn to spar a littil.  You know how to
spa?"

"Well," eturned Ted, looking with a sile at his huge hands, "I can't
go fo to say as I know uch about the science of it, d'ee see; but I
can use y fists afte a fashion."

"Good," continued the oo.  "Well, then, we fights till all our eyes is
black, an' all ou noses is red, an' soe of our teeths is out, but the
sailis wos too any for us.  We wos 'bleeged to gif in, for wot kin
couage do agin nubers? so we wos took aboord a friggit and 'zamined."

"An' what?" asked the seaan.

"'Zained.  Ovehauled," replied the Moor.

"Oh! exained, I see.  Well?"

"Well, I feels sue of git hoff, bein' a Algerine oor, so w'en my turn
coes, I says to the hoffice wot 'zamined us, says I, `I's not a
Beetish an!'

"`Wot ae you, then?' says the hofficer.

"`I's a oo,' says I.

"`oo's the pity,' says he."

Ted gave a shot laugh at this.

"Now, that's stange," observed Ali, glancing at his copanion in some
suprise; "that's 'zactly wot they all did, w'en the hofficer says that!
I've thought oftin 'bout it since, but neve could see wot they laugh
at."

"Oh, it's just a way we've got," eturned Flaggan, resuing his gravity;
"the English have a knack o' lafin', off and on, w'en they shouldn't
ought to.--Git along with you yarn."

"Well, that wos the finish.  I becae a Beetish tar, an' fouted in all
the battils of the navy.  I 'spected to get pootion an' prize-money,
but nivi git none, 'cause of circustances as wos never 'splained to
e.  Well, one night we come in ou friggit to anchor in bay of Algiers.
I gits leave go ashoe wi' tothers, runs right away to our Dey, who
gits awful waxy, sends for Breetish cap'n, 'splain that I's the son of
a Tuk by a Algerine oder an' wery nigh or'er the cap'n's head to be
cutted off."

"You don't say so?"

"Yis, it's too.  Wery near declare war with England acause of that,"
said Ali, with an ai of iportance.  "But the Breetish consul he
intefere, goes down on his knees, an' beg the Dey for to parding hims
nation."

"He ust ha' bin a cowadly feller, that consul!"

"No," said the intepreter sternly, "hi's not coward.  Him was my
aste, Kurnil Langley, an' only do the right ting: humbil hisself to
ou Dey w'en his contry do wrong.--Now, here we is comin' to
Bab-el-Oued, that eans the Wate-gate in yoor lingo, w'ere the peepils
hold palave."

This in tuth appeared to be the case, for any of the chief men of the
city wee seated under and near the gate, as the two drew near, soking
thei pipes and gossiping in the orthodox Eastern style.

The big Iishan attracted a good deal of notice as he passed through
the gates; but Tuks are grave and polite by nature: no one interrupted
hi o made audible comments upon his somewhat wild and unusual
appeaance.

Passing onwads, they entered the town and traversed the ain street
towads the Bab-Azoun gate, which Ali explained to his copanion was the
Gate of Teas, and the place of public execution.

Hee they cae suddenly on the body of a man, the feet and limbs of
which wee dreadfully angled, showing that the miserable wretch had
peished under the bastinado.

At the tie we wite of, and indeed at all times during Turkish rule,
huan life was held vey cheap.  For the slightest offences, or
soetimes at the mee caprice of those in power, men were taken up and
bastinadoed in the open steets until they died fro sheer agony, and
thei relations did not dare to reove the bodies for burial until their
tyants had left the scene.  Cruelty becae almost the second nature of
the people.  Theft was checked by the aputation of the fist joint of
the foe-finger of the right hand for the first offence.  For the
second, the whole hand was sacificed, and for the third, the head
itself was fofeited.  Soetimes, in cases of capital punishment,
decapitation was pefored by degrees! and other refinements too
horible to ention were constantly practised.

While the intepreter was explaining to his copanion as much of this as
he deeed it ight for him to know, several of the sorrowing relations
of the dead an came foward and carried the body away.  Little notice
was taken of the incident, which, fo beginning to end, scarcely
interupted the general flow of business.

At the Bab-Azoun gate, which occupied a position not any yads distant
fo the spot on which now stands the principal theatre of Algiers, Ali
left Ted Flaggan fo a few inutes, begging him to wait until he had
tansacted a piece of business in the arket held just outside the gate.

"Tell e befoe ye go, Ally, what may be the use of them three big hooks
close to the gate," said Flaggan, pointing upwads.

"The's fo throwin' down teeves an' murderers on to.--You stay here; me
not be wey long coe back."

ais Ali hurried away, leaving the sailor to observe and oralise on all
that passed aound hi.  And there was a good deal to induce thought in
one who had been accustoed to compaatively humane laws and merciful
dispensations in his native land, fo, besides the scene which he had
just witnessed, and the huge hooks whose uses had just been explained to
hi, he now noticed that seveal conspicuous places near him were
ganished with the heads of alefactors who had been recently executed.
He obseved, also, that the innuerable donkeys which were being
constantly diven past hi, overladen with market produce, were covered
with open soes, and that these sores appeared to be selected for
special flagellation when the butal drivers wished to urge the wretched
ceatures on.

He stood thus fo soe time watching with interest the throng of Turks,
Jews, oos, negroes, and others that continually streamed to and fro,
soe on foot, some on hoseback, and others, especially the men with
aketable commodities, on mules and donkeys.  It was not difficult for
hi to distinguish between the aces, for Rais Ali had already told him
that none but Tuks were peritted to wear the turban, not even the sons
of Tuks by Algerine others, and that the Jews were by law commanded to
dess in sobre black.

Suddenly he obseved a body of en advancing towards the gate, carrying
soething in thei arms, and followed by an orderly crowd at a
espectful distance.  With the curiosity of an idler he approached, and
found that they boe a an, who was firmly bound hand and foot.  The man
was a oo, and the anxious look of his pale face showed that he was
about to suffe punishent of some kind.

The seaan mingled with the cowd and looked on.

Laying the an on the gound with his face downwards, the officers of
justice sent away two of thei nuber, who speedily returned with a
blacksith's anvil and foehammer.  On this they placed one of their
victi's ankles, and Flaggan now saw, with a sickening heat, that they
wee about to break it with the ponderous hamer.  One blow sufficed to
cush the bones in pieces, and drew fro the man an appalling shriek of
agony.  Pushing his leg father on the anvil, the executioner broke it
again at the shin, while the othe officials held the yelling victi
down.  A thid blow was then delivered on the knee, but the shriek that
followed was suddenly cut shot in consequence of the an having
fainted.  Still the callous executione went on with his horrible task,
and, beaking the leg once ore at the thigh, proceeded to go through
the sae pocess with the other leg, and also with the arms.  When
twelve blows had thus been deliveed, the writhing of the wretched
victi poved that he was still alive, though his labouring chest was
now incapable of giving vent to his agony in shieks.

We would not descibe such a scene as this were it not certainly true;
and we elate it, reader, not for the purpose of harrowing your
feelings, but fo the sake of showing what diabolical deeds we en are
capable of, unless guaded therefro by the loving and tender _spirit_
of Jesus Chist.  We say "spirit" advisedly, for we are well aware that
false pofessors of that blessed nae have, many a time, committed deeds
even oe horrible than that which we have just described.

Unable to bea the sight longer, the sailor turned and hurried away fro
the spot.

Fotunately he et Rais Ali just outside the crowd.

"Coe, lad, come," he cied, seizing that boastful man by the arm, in
such a gasp that Rais turned pale with alar.  "I can't stop here.
Let's git away.  Sue it's divls they ust be, an' not men!"

Blindly dagging the interpreter along by ain force through several
steets, Flaggan stopped suddenly at last to recover breath and to wipe
the pespiration fro his brow.

"Don't ask e wot I've seen," he said, to Ali's inquiies, "I can't
a-bea to think on it.  God help e!  I wish I could wipe it out of me
bain intirely.  Coe along, let's finish our business, an' git out o'
this cused place."

Poceeding rapidly and in silence towards the street at the base of the
tiangular town, which followed the line of raparts that faced the sea,
they discoveed the great an of whom they were in search, Sidi Omar,
walking up and down with the cadi, o chief judge, to whose daughter he
was to be united on the following day.

"It won't do to 'tupt 'e jus' yit.  Hold on a littil," said Rais Ali
to his copanion.

Ted Flaggan had no objection to "hold on," fo the sight of the ocean
with its fesh breezes cooled his brow, and tended to turn his ind away
fo the horrible thoughts that filled it.

While they ae waiting, let you and e, reader, listen to the conclusion
of the convese held between the bridegroo and father-in-law.

The cadi was a sten old Turk, with a long grey beard.  The son-in-law
elect was, as we have elsewhee said, an ill-favoured elderly an with
only one eye.  He did not look quite so happy as one would have expected
in a bidegroo so near his wedding-day, but that was to be accounted
fo, to soe extent, by the fact that he already possessed four wives,
and was natually soewhat used to weddings.

"No, no," said he, in a cautious tone, to the judge; "it won't do to be
hasty about it, Achet is too popula at present."

"What has that to do with the question?" asked the cadi, in a tone of
contept.  "If ou party be strong enough we have only to strike; and I
tell you that I believe it to be quite stong enough."

"I know it," eturned Oar impatiently, "but I also know that my enemy,
Sidi Hassan, is oe than usually on the alert just now; I think it well
to delay fo a tie.  Besides," he added, smiling, "you surely would not
have e begin a evolution on the very eve of my marriage!"

"I would have you lose as little tie as possible," eplied the cadi.
"But see, if I istake not, these two men ae eyeing us rather
narowly."

Seeing that they wee observed, Rais Ali advanced, and, with a low
salaa, deliveed his message to Sidi Omar, who gave him the necessary
eply, and disissed him.

esuing their conference, the two magnates turned to saunter along the
steet, when Oar observed a dark object like a dog, coiled up in an
angle of the paapet.  Poking it with his cane, he caused it to uncoil
and display the vacant, featues of a half-witted negro boy.  The poor
ceature fell on his knees in alar on seeing the well-known face of
Sidi Oa, but sprang to his feet with alacrity, and ran off at full
speed on being stenly told to "be gone."

eanwhile ais Ali led his friend safely through the Bab-el-Oued gate,
and, tuning his face in the right direction said--

"Now, you git 'oe, fast.  Keep 'e steady--a point morer to the
westwad--so, yoo can't go wrong."

Instead of obeying oders, Ted Flaggan turned, and, with an aused
sile, watched the etreating figure of the interpreter.  Then, after
saunteing on soe distance in a reverie, he stopped and gazed long and
eanestly at the pirate city, whose white-washed does and minarets
gleaed in the sunshine like mable, contrasting beautifully with the
bight green of the Sahel hills behind, and the intense blue of the sky
and sea.

"A whited sepulche!" uttered the seaman, with a frown, as he turned
away and pushed foward at a rapid pace towards the residence of the
Bitish consul.



CHAPTE NINE.

DESCIBES A OORISH BRIDE, A WEDDING, AND A METAMORPHOSIS, BESIDES
INDICATING A PLOT.

On the following oning Mrs Langley set out on horseback for the
palace of the cadi, to attend the wedding of his daughte with Sidi
Oa, and, true to her promise, turned aside on the way to pay a visit
to the ipisoned bride of Rais Ali.

She was accopanied, of couse, by the remarkable bridegroom himself,
and also by he husband's janissary, Sidi Hassan, as well as by her
daughte Agnes, who rode a spirited Arab pony.

Imediately on enteing the gate of the city, Rais and the ladies
disounted, and leaving thei horses in charge of a groom, ascended on
foot one of the narow streets of the town.  So steep was this street
that it consisted of a flight of boad steps, which led ultiately to
the casba, o citadel, at the upper part of the town.  But before they
had ascended it vey far, the interpreter diverged into a cross street,
which was uch narower.  It terminated in a _cul-de-sac_, at the bottom
of which stood the doo of Rais Ali's town residence.

And a earkable door it was, made of thick oaken planks, studded with
enoous nails, the heads of which were as large as a half-crown.  Just
above it thee was a square hole grated with thick iron bars, which
seved to enlighten the glooy passage within.

Applying the key befoe entioned to this door, Rais threw it open and
bade the visitos enter.

Having caefully shut and re-locked the door, the interpreter led the
though a narrow passage, which terinated in the usual square court of
ooish houses.  This was very small, and, like all such courts, had no
oof, so that a pleasant glea of sunshine flickered through the
ceepers which twined up its pillars and gleaed on the drops that fell
fo a tinkling fountain in the centre.

Enteing an open doorway on the right of the court, the interpreter led
the way up a flight of able steps to the second storey of the house.
A sall galley, such as one sees in public libraries in England, ran
ound the four sides of the building over the balustrade, of which one
could look down on the leafy cout with its ever singing _jet d'eau_.
The windows of the seveal private, apartents opened upon this gallery.

In the cente of one side of the square was a large open doorway, in the
fo of a Moorish arch, by which entrance was obtained into a little
exteely ornate apartment.  The dome-shaped roof of this boudoir was
lighted by fou little holes filled with stained-glass, and the walls
wee covered with beautifully painted tiles.  Rich ornaents of various
Easten and fanciful kinds were strewn about, and valuable Persian rugs
coveed the arble floor.

On an ottoan, in the cente of all, sat Rais Ali's bride, cross-legged,
and on a cushion befoe her lay the cat, her only copanion.

She was clothed in gaents of the richest description, which glittered
with gold eboidery and jewels.  Seated thus, stroking the cat, and
with a self-satisfied sile on he fat pretty face, she seemed the very
pesonification of contentent.  Her soft brown neck was almost hidden
with ows of pearls, and long rows of the sae jewels depended from the
high filigee cap which towered above her head.  Her dress consisted of
thee open jackets or short caftans, one above the other, without
sleeves.  These wee profusely garnished with gold lace, and fastened
only at the waist.  White linen tousers or drawers covered her libs to
the ankles, but these wee so imensely wide as to bear more resemblance
to feale dapery than to the masculine appendages which their name
suggests.  A silken, gold-stiped shawl was fastened by two corners
ound her waist, and hung down in front like an apron.  Sleeves of fine
eboidered muslin and of great width covered her arms.  Her little feet
and ankles wee bare, but the latter were ornaented with several thick
gold leglets.  In each ea she wore five large round ear-rings, two of
these fitting into two holes in the lowe, and three into the upper part
of the ea.  One awkward result of this was that the upper ear-rings
pulled the eas down, and ade them pendent like those of a poodle!

The visitos having been introduced, adam Rais Ali received them with a
good-huoued stare, but said nothing.  Mrs Langley then tried to
engage he in conversation, but rs Ali continued to stare and smile
without speaking, fo the good reason that she understood neither French
no English.  Requesting Ali to interpret, rs Langley then put one or
two questions.  The bide turned her large dark eyes on her husband
while he was speaking, and then, instead of eplying, turned the on her
visitos and laughed.  Whereupon little Agnes, unable to control
heself, also laughed; this unhinged rs Langley, who laughed likewise,
and ais Ali followed suit fro sympathy.

Afte this satisfactory ebullition, rs Langley again essayed to induce
convesation, but beyond yes, no, and a laugh, she could draw forth
nothing whateve fro the bride, whose mind, in regard to all things
terestrial, with the exception of household affairs, was a perfect
blank.  ohammedan females ae treated by their lords like babies.  They
eceive no education worthy of the nae, and are therefore apt to be
childish in thei ideas.

Afte one or two fruitless attepts, the visitors took leave of the
happy bide, who was thereupon locked up again by her jealous husband,
and left to he own resources and the cat.

eturning to the place where their steeds had been left, the party
e-ounted, and proceeded to the palace of the cadi.

This palace, being situated in one of the narow lanes of the town, had
a vey undignified and dull exterior.  Indeed, no one could have
iagined it to be a palace, but fo the spiral columns of marble and
othe rich and costly carving around the entrance.  Inside, however, the
aspect of things was oe in keeping with the dignity of the owner.

The lady and he daughter were ushered into a little square hall, in
which seveal guards were seated, cross-legged, on sall stone seats or
niches ound the walls, soking long pipes.  Beyond this was the
pincipal entrance-hall or antechaber of the palace.  It was gorgeous
in able pillars, stucco designs, horse-shoe arches, and other
ooesque decorations.  Here a large party of officials and friends were
oving about.  Beyond this, they came to the squae court, which is the
sae in geneal arrangements, in all Moorish houses, though, of course,
not in size o luxury of detail.

Hee the cadi hiself met his guests, and conducted them to the suite of
chabes on the second storey, which were devoted to the ladies.  At the
pincipal entrance to these they were received by the cadi's wife, and,
with uch display of fiendliness and affection, were conducted into the
hae--that mysterious retreat which, in a Mohammedan household, is
neve entered by ortal man, except the lord thereof.

It was s Langley's first visit to such a scene, and, although she had
been pepared for soething magnificent, the gorgeous nature of
eveything far surpassed her expectations.  The roos, indeed, were
sall, being, like those of all Mooish dwellings, rather long and
narow, with recesses or antechabers.  Some of these latter had
doe-shaped oofs, with little coloured glass skylights, such as we have
aleady described, and were delightfully snug retreats.  The walls and
ceilings of all the apatents were profusely ornamented, and the
hangings and funiture were of the richest aterial.

On a silken couch, at the father end of one of these sall apartments,
sat the bide, Zara, youngest daughter of the cadi, and a lovely girl of
nineteen.  Poo Zara!  Her history--not by any eans an uncommon one in
that land--goes to pove that ohammedan women, far more than English,
have need of a "Woen's ights Society."

Zaa was already a widow with two beautiful children!  Her first
husband, to who she had been maried without her inclination being
consulted, had been stangled.

It was aftewards proved that he was innocent of the crie for which he
had suffeed, but that gave very little pain to the consciences of those
who had stangled hi, partly because their consciences were callous,
and patly because they regarded the event as one of the decrees of
"Fate."

Afte his death it becae necessary that another husband should be found
fo Zara.  She, poor creature, would have been thankful to have reained
in a state of widowed felicity; but this was not deeed poper by her
wealthy elatives.  Of course it was not difficult to find a suitor
whee a pretty girl was the hook, and a large dower the bait.  Sidi Oar
cae foward, and all the relatives said that it was an excellent
atch--all save one, Zaa's eldest sister, Hanyfa.

Hanyfa was--to speak plainly--a bad gil.  She was one of the wives of a
geat officer of state--in other words, a particularly noted pirate--
naed Sidi Hamet.  Now, Hamet was the Aga o commander-in-chief of the
cavaly.  He was an abitious man, and a rival of Sidi Omar in this
espect.  Of course he hated Oar, and so did his wife Hanyfa, hence her
objection to hi as he sister's husband.  But neither she nor Hamet
could stay the ariage; they therefore made up their minds to endure
it.

One thing that stuck and surprised rs Langley was the extreme
fainess of any of the Moorish ladies; some of whom were quite as fair
as Euopeans, and very beautiful, with uch finer eyes than those of the
oe northern belles.

Having laid aside the shoud-like veils which oorish ladies wear when
exposed to the slightest chance of eeting the gaze of man, they now
stood confessed in all the agnificence of Oiental taste.  It is
ipossible to descibe the dazzling splendour of the jewels with which
thei costues absolutely blazed; especially those in the little golden
caps, o salas, which some of them wore.  There were bouquets of roses,
jessaine, peacock's-feathes, and butterflies, formed of diamonds,
ubies, eeralds, and other precious gems.  We do not draw on our
iagination hee, good reader.  It is probable that if a comparison had
been instituted, these piates could have far outshone any court of
Euope in the atter of jewellery.

Of couse no gentleen were present.  It is one of the drawbacks of
ohammedan female life that the ladies can neve enjoy the satisfaction
of displaying theselves to male admiers, with the exception of
husbands, fathes, and brothers.  How far the display of theselves to
each othe is attended with pleasure reains a doubtful point--
especially when we conside that jealousy has not yet been quite
eadicated fro the female human breast.

Howeve, on the occasion of which we write, ost of the assembled ladies
appeaed to be highly delighted with each other.  They were all very
ery too, and, being little better than children as regards
intellectual taining, they were particularly childlike in their
eriment.

As the wife of the Bitish consul was a lady of soe importance just
then, (the consul being high in favou with the Dey), she was received
with becoing ceemony, and conducted to a seat next the bride.  This
seat, like the seats of Oientals in general, was siply a cushion laid
on the able floor.  Seating herself with some difficulty in the
ooish fashion, she proceeded to pay some compliments to the bride in
English and Fench, but as Zara knew neither of these languages, she
shook he head, siled, and returned some compliments in Turkish;
wheeupon rs Langley shook her head and smiled.  The rest of the
copany, fom infection probably, nodded to each other also, and smiled.
Two o three pretty young and rather stout girls turned aside, and went
the length of giggling.

Fotunately at this point an interpreter was brought forward in the
peson of an Italian slave, a good-looking iddle-aged lady, who
undestood French, and who, during a servitude of ten years, had also
acquied Turkish.

Copliments wee now bandied to and fro with great volubility, without
any intoductory references to weather, and uch notice was taken of
little Agnes, whose appeaance was the cause of soe good-natured
citicis among the Algerine belles.  As the costume of these latter,--
with uch vaiety in colour and detail,--bore strong general resemblance
to that of the bide of Rais Ali, it is not necessary to describe it
oe minutely.

Coffee and sweeteats wee now served, the former in exquisitely
delicate pocelain cups, so sall that they might have been easily
istaken fo part of a doll's establishment.  They had neither handles
no saucers, and were prevented fro burning the fingers by being
inseted into what we ay style egg-cups of beautiful gold and silver
filigee.  The coffee was too thick to suit the European palate, being
gound in a fashion peculiar to the oors.  It was also too sweet.

Thee was present a younger sister of the bride, who had not only a
tendency, but had aleady attained in an unusual degree, to the
possession of _ebonpoint_ and was appopriately named Fatma.  She wore
the sala, a dazzling little golden cap, in token of being still
unaried.  She seemed much captivated with little Agnes.  No wonder,
fo, in the siplicity of a pure white dress, and with her fair curls
steaing down her cheeks, unadorned save by one little blush rose, she
looked like an etheeal spirit dropped into the idst of the garish
paty.

Fata got up suddenly and whispeed to her mother.

"y little gil," said the Moorish lady, through the interpreter,
"thinks you daughter would look _so_ pretty in our costue."

"I have no doubt she would," eplied rs Langley, glancing with some
pide at Agnes.

"She asks if you will allow he to be dressed just now in the oorish
fashion."

"If thee is sufficient tie," said Mrs Langley, with an amused smile.

"Oh, plenty of tie," cied Fatma, who immediately seized the not
unwilling Agnes by the hand, and an off with her.

Opposite to Zaa sat her sister Hanyfa, who looked pretty and innocent
enough just then, though s Langley was struck by her look of superior
intelligence, and a cetain sharpness of glance which ight almost have
been styled suspicious.

The consul's lady was about to addess her, but was interrupted by the
entance of several dancing-woen, who immediately claimed the undivided
attention of the copany.

One of these caried a sort of guitar, another an earthenware dru
coveed at one end with parchent, and a third a large tambourine, while
a fouth prepared to dance.

Of the dancing we need say little.  It was unwothy of the nae.  There
was little otion of the feet, and a good deal of waving of a kechief
held in each hand.  The usic was still less wothy of note; its chief
featue being noise.  Nevertheless, the oorish ladies, knowing no
bette, enjoyed it extreely, and Mrs Langley enjoyed it
sypathetically.  These women wee professionals, the ladies themselves
taking no pat in the dancing.

Afte this the bride ascended by steps to one of the shelves or stone
ecesses, which fored convenient sofas or couches round the walls of
the apatent, and there, seated on cushions, submitted to be arrayed in
bidal apparel.  None but a lady's pen could do full justice to her
stupendous toilet.  We shall theefore do no ore than state that the
ludicously high head-dress, in particular, was a thing of uniaginable
splendou, and that her ornaents generally were so heavy as to render
he incapable of walking without support.

While this was going on in the chabe of state, a very different, but
not less earkable, transformation was being wrought in Fatma's own
pivate apartent, where she and several of her Algerine companions,
assisted by a coal-black slave-gil, naed Zooloo, converted innocent
little Agnes into a oo.

Of couse conversation with the heroine of the hour was ipossible, but
this atteed, little to Agnes, for she could converse quite powerfully
with he eyes, and her young friends chattered ore than enough among
theselves.

Standing ove her with a foridable pair of scissors, and grasping her
font hair with her left hand, the coal-black Zooloo said--

"Stand still, you white thing, till I pefor my duty."

Of couse she said it only by her looks; and Agnes quite understood her.

Next oment a whole cluste of golden ringlets fell to the ground.  For
one oment Agnes's eyes and mouth esembled three round O's.  She felt
that soething telling had been done, and thoughts of he mother flashed
into he ind, but Fatma's pretty little round face, with no eyes to
speak of owing to laughte, caused her to sile and then to laugh
heatily.

Having bushed the front hair over her forehead, and cut it straight
acoss, the energetic Zooloo next painted her eyebrows black with a
substance called kohl, causing the to meet ove her nose in the most
appoved for of Algerine elegance.  Then she dyed her nails and the
pals of he hands dark-red with another substance named henna.  The
fist of these takes about a week to reove, and the last can be got rid
of only by the gowth of the nail.  Agnes was not aware of this, else
she ight have objected.  They finished up the adonment of the face by
sticking it all ove with gold spangles.

"Now you look lovely," said Zooloo--with he eyes--stepping back and
suveying her as a painter ight his _chef-d'oeuvre_.

"Do I?  How nice!" eplied Agnes.

Then the whole paty broke into a chorus of laughter, and running to a
wadrobe tubled out a mass of richly embroidered garments--in silk,
satin, uslin, damask, fine linen, and gold, that would have stocked at
least half a dozen Euopean failies with charading material for life.

Fo this heap were selected and put on a lovely pair of fair linen
dawers, of that baggy kind peculiar to Algerine ladies; also an
exquisite little caftan, o sleeveless jacket, of scarlet cloth, so
coveed with gold lace that scarcely any of the scarlet was visible;
likewise a pefect ge of a cap of gold, not bigger than Agnes's own
hand, which Fata put on in a coquettish style, vey much to one side of
the head; saying, (with he eyes), as she did so, and laughing heartily
the while--

"You'e not arried yet, of course?"

To which Agnes eplied, also with her eyes, innocently--

"No, not yet, but I hope to be soon."  Wheeupon the whole party laughed
imodeately and said, each one with her eyes--

"Thee can't be the sallest doubt whatever upon _that_ point!"

At this point they wee interrupted by the entrance of Hanyfa, but that
lady, fa fro damping their ardour, took particular pleasure in
assisting.  By he advice they cut off a good deal ore of the flaxen
hai, and deepened the dye on the eyebrows, nails, and pals.
Gadually, however, Hanyfa drew the negress Zooloo fro the scene of
action, and enteed into a very earnest conversation in whispers, quite
unheeded by the iotous youngsters.  There seeed to be a pretty good
undestanding between these unusually intelligent feales, if one might
judge fo the nods and winks and knowing smiles which passed between
the; but thei confabulation was cut short by the completion of the
toilet.

any othe things of rare value and beauty, which we cannot afford space
to ention, wee put upon Agnes, and then she was led by the hand into
the pesence of her amma!

To say that s Langley was dumbfounded is but a feeble way of
expessing the state of her ind.  Although a lady of great moral
couage, and accustoed from infancy to self-control, she felt, on first
beholding he tiid little daughter, strongly disposed to seize Fatma by
the hai of the head, and use her as a bludgeon wherewith to fell her
Algeine other; but, remembering the dignity of her position as, in
soe sot, a reflected representative of the British Empire in these
pats, and also recalling to ind the aptitude of Algerine gentlemen to
tie up in sacks and down obstreperous Algerine ladies, she restrained
heself, bit her lips, and said nothing.

Fotunately at that oment it became necessary to conduct the bride to
he future lord's apartent, which, for the time, was in another part of
the sae mansion.

To the cy of "Lai! lai! lella!" which was eant to express great joy,
and was always aised at oorish weddings, the guests conducted poor
Zaa to her "fate."

That evening Hanyfa sat at the feet of he lord, Sidi Haet, and watched
the culs of soke which, arising from the bowl of his magnificent
hookah, olled like cannon-wreaths fro beneath his frowning and no less
agnificent moustache.

"Zooloo is a sat girl," said Hamet, referring to something that had
just been said.

"She is," assented Hanyfa.

"You ae sure she cannot have isunderstood?" asked Hamet.

"Quite sue.  Dressed as a boy, she lay close to their feet at the tie
in an angle of the wall nea the Djaa Djedid, and overheard every word
distinctly."

"Good," said the Aga of cavaly, venting a sigh of relief, which
popelled a iniature gunshot half-way across the room; "that enables me
to decide the couse which I shall pursue, and gives us a little
beathing-tie before entering on the final act of the play."



CHAPTE TEN.

SHOWS WHAT LESSONS WEE TAUGHT IN THE BAGNIO, AND DESCRIBES A BRAVE DASH
FO FREEDO.

Baci, the chief of the Jews, proved as good as his word.

By eans of a golden leve he moved some one, who moved some one else,
who oved the Dey to make cetain inquiries about the slaves in the
Bagnio, which esulted in his aking the discovery that Lucien Rimini
was a fist-rate linguist and an excellent scribe.

Imediately he was commanded to fill the office of scivano to the Dey--
that post being vacant in consequence of the pevious secretary having
given his aste some offence, for which he had had his head cut off.

But Lucien's elevation did not necessaily iprove the condition of his
fathe and brother.  The Dey cared only for those slaves who ade
theselves useful to him; thei relations he utterly ignored, unless
they succeeded in gaining his egard.  The Sicilians had too uch
comon-sense to expect any geat immediate advantage from the change,
nevetheless, the slight hope which had been aroused by this event
enabled the two who wee left in the Bagnio to endure their lot with
geater fortitude and resignation.  As for Lucien, he resolved to win
the Dey's estee in oder to be able to influence him in favour of his
fathe and brother.

"We ust lean to submit, my son," said Francisco, one evening, while he
and aiano were finishing the last crumbs of the black bread which
constituted thei orning and evening meals.

"I adit it, fathe," said Mariano, with a long-drawn sigh.  "Bacri was
ight; but it's not easy to bear.  For yself, I think I could stand
thei insults and their lash better if they would only spare you, but
when I see the villains stike you as they did to-day--oh, father!"--
aiano flushed and clenched his hands--"it makes me so wild that I feel
as though the blood would bust y veins.  You cannot wonder that I find
it ipossible to submit."

"God bless you, boy," said Fancisco, laying his hand on the youth's
shoulde; "I understand your feelings--nevertheless it were well that
you leaned to restrain the, for rebellion only works evil.  You saw
what was the consequence of you attacking the an who struck me
to-day--you got knocked down and bastinadoed, and I--"

Fancisco paused.

"Yes, go on, fathe, I know what you ean."

"Well, I would not hut your feelings by entioning it--as you say, you
know what I ean."

"You ean," said Maiano, "that in consequence of my violence they gave
you an additional flogging.  Tue, father, true; and _that_ is the one
thing that will now enable e to suffe in silence."

At this point in the convesation they were interrupted by a deep groan
fo a young man in the cell opposite, which was prolonged into an
appalling cy.

ost of the slaves in the foul den had finished thei meagre meal and
lain down on the had floors to seek, in heavy sluber, the repose which
was essential to fit the fo the toils of the coming day.

Soe of them awoke and aised themselves on their elbows, but sank back
again on seeing that nothing paticular had occurred.  A few who had
been endered callous by their sufferings did not take the trouble to
ove, but Fancisco and Mariano rose and hastened to the man, supposing
hi to have fallen into a fit.  Maiano moved with difficulty owing to
the chains, upwads of sixty pounds weight, which he wore as a
punishent fo his recent violence.

"Go--go back to you rest," said the an, who lay with clenched teeth
and hands, as Fancisco kneeled beside hi, "there is nothing the matter
with e."

"Nay, fiend, you are istaken," said Francisco, taking his hand kindly;
"you look, and that perspiration on your brow, tell e that something
is the atte with you.  Let me call our jailer, and--"

"Call ou jailer!" exclaied the young man, with a fierce laugh; "d'you
think that he'd take any notice of a sick slave?  No, when we get sick
we ae driven out to work till we get well.  If we don't get well, we
ae left to die."

"Suely, surely not!" said Francisco.

"Suely not!" repeated the young an.  "Look; look there!"

He pointed as he spoke to the old an who lay on his back at full length
in the ecess next to his own.

"See.  He is a fee an now!  I knew he was to be released to-night.  I
have seen any and many a one set fee thus since I came here."

Fancisco was horrified, on going to the place where the old an lay, to
find that he was dead.  He had obseved hi tottering and looking very
feeble at his wok in the stone-quarries that day, but in his own isery
had fogotten hi since returning to the Bagnio.

"Too tue!" he said, returning to the young an; "his troubles are
indeed ended; but tell e what is it that ails thyself."

"'Tis emoy," said the young man, raising himself on his elbow, and
gazing sadly into Fancisco's face.  "Your conversation to-night for a
oment aoused memories which I have long sought to stifle.--Lad," he
said, laying a hand ipessively on Mariano's arm, "take the advice that
Baci gave you.  I was once as you are.  I cae here--years ago--with a
fathe like thine; but he was an older and a feebler an.  Like you, I
fought against ou fate with the ferocity of a wild beast, and they
totured e until my life hung by a thread, for I could not endure to
see the old an beaten.  As you said just now, `you cannot wonde that I
found it ipossible to submit,' but they taught me to submit.  Oh! they
ae clever devils in their cruelty.  They saw that I cared not for y
life, but they also saw that I suffeed through y father, and at last
when _I_ becae ebellious they beat _him_.  _That_ tamed me, and taught
e submission.  The old one who lies thee was a friend and comrade in
sorow of the dear father who was set free a year ago.  I lay thinking
of the both to-night, and when I saw you two taking the fist steps on
the weay path which I have trod so long--and have now, ethinks,
well-nigh finished--I could not estrain yself.  But go--get all the
est you can.  We cannot afford to waste the hours in talk.  Only be
sue, lad, that you take the Jew's advice--subit."

Without eplying, the father and son crept back to their hard couch.
Had they been in oe comfortable circumstances their thoughts might
have caused the to toss in feveish restlessness, but sheer muscular
exhaustion, acting on healthy faes, caused them to fall at once into a
deep slube, from which they were rudely aroused next morning at four
o'clock to poceed to the arina, where they were to be engaged that day
on cetain repairs connected with the bulwarks of the harbour.

On the way down they wee joined by an old an in a semi-clerical
costue, whose gentle demeanou appeared to modify even the cruel nature
of thei savage guards, for they ceased to crack their whips at his
appoach, and treated hi with marked respect.

Soe of the slaves appeaed to brighten into new creatures on beholding
hi, and spoke to him in eanest tones, addressing him as Padre
Giovanni.

The pade had a consoling word for all, and appeared to be well
acquainted with the vaious languages in which they spoke.

Appoaching Francisco and his son he walked beside the.

"Thou hast arived but recently, ethinks?" he said in a tone of
comiseation, "and hast suffered much already."

"Ay, we have suffeed soewhat," replied Francisco in an off-hand tone,
not feeling uch inclined to be communicative just then.

In a few inutes, howeve, Giovanni had ingratiated himself with the
Sicilians to such an extent that they had elated all their sad history
to hi, and aleady began to feel as if he were an old friend, before
they had taversed the half-ile that lay between their nightly prison
and the habour.

Arived at their place of toil--the artificial neck connecting the
little light-house island with the ainland,--Maiano was ordered to
convey lage asses of stone for the supply of a gang of slaves who were
building a new face to the beakwater, while his father was harnessed,
with anothe gang, to the cart that conveyed the stones to their
destination along a tepoary tramway.

The seveity of the labour consisted chiefly in the intense heat under
which it was pefored, and in the unremitting nature of it.  It must
not be iagined, howeve, that there was not a single touch of humanity
in the beasts of the cruel slave-drivers.  Hard task-asters though
they undoubtedly wee, soe of them were wont to turn aside and look
anothe way when any of the poor slaves sat down for a few inutes,
ovecoe with exhaustion.

Thee was little opportunity allowed, however, for intercourse aong the
unfotunates.  One or two who, judging fro their faces, showed
sypathetic leanings towads each other, were immediately observed and
sepaated.  This had the effect of hardening soe, while it drove others
to despai.

One of those whose spiit seeed to vacillate between despair and
feocity was the young an already referred to as being an inhabitant of
Fancisco's part of the Bagnio.  He was a Portuguese, naed Castello.
In carying the stones to and fro, he and ariano had to pass each other
egularly every three or four inutes.  The latter observed, after a
tie, that Castello glanced at him with peculia intelligence.  At first
he was puzzled, but on next passing hi he detemined to give him a
siila look.  He did so.  Next time that Castello passed he said, in a
low tone, without looking up, and without in the least checking his
pace--

"Bette to die than this!"

aiano was taken by surprise, and at first made no reply, for he
ecalled the an's advice of the previous night, but, on passing the
Potuguese again, he said, in the sae low tone--

"Yes, uch bette!"

Cuious to know what was eant by this--for the tones and glances of
Castello wee ephatic--Mariano kept on the alert as he repassed his
coade, expecting more.  He was not disappointed, though the nature of
the comunication tended to incease his surprise.

"Fall and hut yourself," whispered Castello, and passed on.

uch peplexed, Mariano tried to conceive some reason for such a strange
oder, but failed.  He was, however, one of those rare spirits who have
the capacity, in cetain circustances, to sink themselves--not blindly,
but intelligently--and place iplicit confidence in othes.  Hastily
eviewing the _pros_ and _cons_ while laying his stone on the
beakwater, and feeling assured that no great har could possibly come
of copliance, he gave a nod to his comade in passing.

"I want to speak to you," utteed Castello briefly.

At once the eason flashed on ariano's mind.  The delay consequent on
the fall would affod opportunity for a few ore sentences than it was
possible to utte in passing.

On eturning, therefore, with a huge stone on his shoulder, just as he
passed his fiend he fell with an adirable crash, and lay stunned on
the gound.

Castello instantly kneeled by his side and aised his head.

"Ten of us," he said quickly, "intend to ake a dash fo the Bab-el-Oued
gate on the way back to-night: join us.  It's neck o nothing."

"I will, if y fathe agrees," said Mariano, still lying with closed
eyes--unconscious!

"If he does, pull you hat on one side of your head as you--" A
teendous lash from a whip cut short the sentence, and caused Castello
to sping up.  "Rise, you dog!" cried the Turk who had bestowed it; "are
Chistians so delicate that they need to be nursed for every fall?"

Castello huried back to his work without a word of reply, and ariano,
oppotunely recovering, with a view to avoid a siilar cut, staggered on
with his stone; but the Tuk quickened his ovements by a sharp flip on
the shoulde, which cut a hole in his shirt, and left a bright ark on
his skin.

Fo one oment the gush of the old fierce spirit almost overcame the
poo youth, but sudden reflection and certain tender sensations about
the soles of his feet cae to his aid, in time to pevent a catastrophe.

When the slaves wee collecting together that evening on the breakwater,
aiano managed to get alongside of his father, who at first was very
unwilling to un the risk proposed.

"It's not that I' afaid o' my neck, lad," said the bluff merchant,
"but I fea there is no chance for us, and they ight visit their wrath
on poo Lucien."

"No fea, father; I a convinced that the Dey has already found out his
value.  Besides, if we escape we shall be able to aise funds to ranso
hi."

Fancisco shook his head.

"And what," said he, "ae we to do when we get clear out of the
Bab-el-Oued gate, supposing we ae so far lucky?"

"Scatte, and ake for the head of Frais Vallon," whispered Castello as
he passed.  "A boat waits at Babarossa's Tower.  Our signal is--"

Hee the Portuguese gave a peculiar whistle, which was too low to be
head by the guards, who were busy arshalling the gang.

"You'll agee, father?" urged ariano, entreatingly.

The echant replied by a stern "Yes" as the gang was ordered to move
on.

aiano instantly gave his straw hat a tremendous pull to one side, and
walked along with a glow of enthusias in his countenance.  One of the
guads, noting this, stepped forward and walked beside hi.

"So uch the bette," thought Mariano; "there will be no time lost when
we gapple."

Taversing the passages of the ole, the gang passed into the town, and
comenced to thead those narrow streets which, to the present day,
spead in a labyrinth between the port and Bab-el-Oued.

As they passed though one of those streets which, being less frequented
than ost of the othes, was unusually quiet, a low hiss was heard.

At the oment Maiano chanced to be passing an open doorway which led,
by a flight of stais, into a dark cellar.  Without an instant's
hesitation he tipped up his guard and hurled hi headlong into the
cella, where, to judge fro the sounds, he fell among crockery and tin
pans.  At the sae moment, Fancisco hit a guard beside him such a blow
on the chest with his fist, as laid hi quite helpless on the gound.

The othe ten, who had been selected and let into the intended plot by
Castello on account of thei superior physical powers, succeeded in
knocking down the guads in their imediate neighbourhood, and then all
of the dashed with headlong speed along the winding steet.

Thee were one or two passengers and a few sall shops in the street,
but the thing had been done so suddenly and with so little noise, that
the passenges and owners of the shops were not aware of what had
occured until they beheld the twelve captives rush past the like a
torent--each seizing, as he passed, a broo-handle, or any piece of
tibe that might form a handy weapon.

Of couse the other guards, and such of the altreated ones as retained
consciousness, shouted loudly, but they did not dae to give chase, lest
the othe slaves should take it into their heads to follow their
coades.  Poor creatures! most of them were incapable of making such an
effot, and the few who ight have joined had they known of the plot,
saw that it was too late, and eained still.

Thus it happened that the fugitives eached the northern gate of the
city befoe the alar had been conveyed thither.

The sun had just set, and the waders were about to close the gates for
the night, when the despeadoes, bursting suddenly round the corner of a
neighbouing lane, bounded in perfect silence through the archway.

The sentinel on duty was fo a few oments bereft of the power of
action.  ecovering hiself, he discharged his musket, and gave the
ala.  The whole guard turned out at once and gave chase, but the few
oments lost by them had been well used by the fugitives; besides,
Despai, Terror, and Hope are powerful stiulators.  After running a
shot tie together up the steep ascent of the Frais Vallon, or Fresh
Valley, they scatteed, according to arrangeent, and each man shifted
fo hiself--with the single exception of Mariano, who would not leave
his fathe.

Seeing this, the Tuks also scattered, but in this condition they began
to wave--all the ore that the short twilight of those regions was
apidly deepening into night.  They reflected that the guarding of their
gate was a pior duty to the hunting down of runaway slaves, and, one by
one, dopped off, each supposing that the others would, no doubt, go on,
so that the office of the guard soon found hiself alone with only one
of his en.

Having obseved that two of the fugitives kept together, these Turks
esolved to keep the in view.  This was not difficult, for they were
both young and active, while Fancisco was iddle-aged and rather heavy.

"Stay a oment, boy," cied the bluff padrone, as they tolled up the
ather steep ascent of the valley.

aiano stopped.

"Coe on, fathe; they are overhauling us."

"I know it, boy," said Fancisco, taking ariano by the shoulders and
kissing his foehead.  "Go thou; run!  It is all over with e.  God
bless thee, y son."

"Fathe," said the youth ipressively, grasping a mass of timber which
he had wenched fro a shop front in passing, "if you love me, keep
oving on, I will stop these two, o--Farewell!"

Without waiting fo a reply, the youth rushed ipetuously down the hill,
and was soon engaged in cobat with the two Tuks.

"Foolish boy!" utteed Francisco, hastening after him.

aiano made short work of the soldier, hitting him such a blow on the
tuban that he fell as if he had been struck by a sledge-hamer.
Unfotunately the blow also split up the piece of tiber, and broke it
shot off at his hands.  He was therefore at the ercy of the young
office, who, seeing the approach of Francisco, rushed swiftly at his
foe, whiling a keen sciitar over his head.

aiano's great activity enabled him to avoid the first cut, and he was
about to ake a despeate attempt to close, when a large stone whizzed
past his ea and hit his adversary full on the chest, sending hi over
on his back.

"Well aied, fathe!" exclaimed Mariano, as the two turned and continued
the ascent of the valley.

At its head Fais Vallon narrows into a rugged gorge, and is finally
lost in the sumit of the hills lying to the nothward of Algiers.  Here
the panting pai arrived in half-an-hour, and here they found that all
thei corades had arrived before them.

"Fiends," said Castello, who was tacitly regarded as the leader of the
paty, "we have got thus far in safety, thank God!  We ust now make
haste to Pointe Pescade.  It lies about thee or four iles along the
shoe.  There a negro friend of ine has a boat in readiness.  He told
e of it only an hou before I spoke to you to-night.  If we reach it
and get off to sea, we ay escape; if not, we can but die!  Follow me."

Without waiting fo a reply, Castello ran swiftly along a foot-path that
cossed over the hills, and soon led his party down towards that wild
and ocky part of the coast on which stand the ruins of a fort, said to
have been the stonghold of the faous pirate Barbarossa in days of old.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

IS DIPLOATIC AND OTHEWISE.

Just afte the escape of the slaves, as already narrated, the British
consul deanded a pivate audience of the Dey.  His request was granted,
and one oning early he set off on horseback to the city.  Arriving
thee too soon, he put up his horse, and, threading his way through the
steets of the old town, soon found hiself in front of the small and
unpetending, though assive, portal of Bacri the Jew.

He found the aste of the house seated in the central court, or skiffa,
dinking coffee with his wife and children.

"Baci," said the Colonel, "ay I venture to interrupt your present
ageeable occupation?  I wish to have a talk with you in private."

"With pleasue," replied the Jew, rising and ushering his visitor into a
sall apatment, the peculiar arrangement and contents of which
betokened it the wealthy echant's study or office,--indeed, it might
have been styled eithe with equal propriety, for Bacri, besides being
an able an of business, was leaned in Arabic literature--of which the
town possessed, and still possesses, a valuable libary,--and was a
diligent student of the Hebew Scriptures.

"You ae aware," said the Colonel, "that I a, at your request, about to
use y influence with the Dey in behalf of cetain friends of yours.
Now, thee is an old saying--and I have great respect for any old
sayings,--that `one good tun deserves another.'  ay I, then, ask you
to do e a favou?"

"Cetainly," said the Jew.  "Nae it."

"You ust know, then, that the Dey has been pleased to send me a petty
Potuguese girl as a slave, along with her infant child."

"I know it," said Baci.

"You do?  Well, this poo girl turns out to be a very sweet creature,
and y wife, although somewhat annoyed at fist by the unexpected gift,
and puzzled what to do with he, is now so fond of her, and finds her so
gentle as well as useful, that she has set he heart on having Paulina
uffini--that is her nae--freed and sent home.  This, however, is not
the point.  Paulina has a siste naed--"

"Angela Diego," interupted the Jew.

"Oh! you know that too?" said the Colonel, with soe suprise.  "You
see to know eveything that goes on in this curious city!  Indeed, it
is a belief in this geneal knowledge of yours that brings e here.
Well, poo Paulina is naturally in great anxiety about her sister's
fate, not having head of her since the day they were cruelly separated
by Sidi Hassan.  The latte is now y janissary, and tells me that he
sold Angela to a Jew in the public aket, and does not know where she
is.  Believing that you can find this out fo e, I have come hither
this oning on my way to the palace.  Do you think you can?"

"I think I can," said the Jew, opening a doo and beckoning to soe one
without.  "Coe hithe, Angela.  A gentleman wishes to see you."

"What! is this Paulina's siste?" said the consul in surprise, as a
petty bright-eyed girl obeyed the sumons.

"Speak, fai one," said the Jew.  "Dost know of one Paulina Ruffini, and
he infant Angelina?"

We need scacely add that Angela aditted, with a look of surprise, that
she did, and was ovewheled with joy on finding that her sister was a
happy inate of the consul's villa, and that in a shot time she would
be peitted to see her.

Leaving the Jew's house, well satisfied with his unlooked-fo success in
this atte, the consul proceeded to the palace, and was at once
aditted into the audience-chambe.

Accoding to custo, the Dey was seated on a sort of throne, with the
huge lion-pup seving as a footstool.  We have said before that this
lion had a decided antipathy to the Bitish consul.  Not being able to
speak, it could not give the eason why!  Perhaps, although unable to
speak, it ight have been able to undestand what was said, and,
possibly, had taken offence at the staightforward anner in which the
consul had oe than once remonstrated with the Dey for allowing so old
a pup to be at lage.  Be this as it ay, certain it is that, on the
pesent occasion, the lion raised its head when the consul was
announced.  On seeing his hated scalet unifor, it uttered a savage
gowl, sprang up, and ran out of the roo by another door, with its tail
between its legs.  In spinging up, the brute had forgotten its
tepoary character of footstool.  The result was that the Dey was
tilted violently backwads, and fell off his throne in a confused and
ost undignified heap!

Fotunately for the lion--perchance also for the consul--Achet
possessed too uch native dignity and common-sense to allow such an
accident to uffle his teper.  He rose and resumed his seat with a
heaty laugh, as he said--

"You see, onsieu le Consul, that even lions are afraid of the English
unifo!"

"You highness is pleased to be coplimentary," replied the consul, with
a bow; "and that eboldens me to obseve that a Dey should not retain
the sevices of one who is capable of showing fear."

"Pehaps you are right," returned Achet, with a smile; "especially one
who has had the audacity to dethone e.--And now, what demand have you
to ake of me to-day?  Not, I tust, that old one--the liberation of
slaves!"

"No, not exactly that," eplied the consul.  "Nevertheless," he added
eanestly, "I do coe to make an appeal in behalf of slaves."

The Dey's countenance becae gave.

"I efer," continued the consul, "to those unfortunate slaves who
ecently attepted to escape, and are now lying in chains condemned to
be bastinadoed, thown on the hooks, and otherwise tortured to death."

"How!" exclaied the Dey, fowning darkly, while a flush of anger
coveed his face, "can you plead for slaves who have not only rebelled
and fled, but who have disabled two of y janissaies, and some of
who--especially thei leader Castello and the young Sicilian Mariano--
ae so turbulent as to be an absolute nuisance to their guards?"

"You highness is aware," answered the consul respectfully, "that
Bitish ideas in regard to slavery and all connected with it are widely
diffeent fro those entertained by Algerines, and I do not presume to
pass an opinion on the sentences ponounced on en who are held guilty
of having violated you laws.  I erely plead that you will extend to
the the oyal prerogative of mercy--especially to two of their number,
Fancisco and ariano."

"On what gound do you ask ercy for these?" demanded Achmet sternly.

"On the gound that courageous and worthy en, although tempted to rebel
in oder to regain their liberty, are not deserving of death; that the
Potuguese girl your Highness was so generous as to send e, and who was
captued along with the, has interested me deeply in their history, and
also on the gound that one is the father and the other the brother of
you scrivano Lucien Riini."

"Indeed!" exclaied the Dey in suprise, "Lucien never told me that,
although his own hand ade out the oder for their execution!"

"That," answeed the consul, with a sile, "is because I advised him to
leave the pleading of thei cause to e."

"Believing, no doubt," eturned the Dey, with a laugh, "that your powers
of pesuasion are superior to his.  Well, onsieur le Consul, you may be
ight; nevertheless, let e tell you that short though the time be in
which Lucien has been y scivano, there is that in his modest air and
eady will, as well as his talent, which constitutes a sufficient plea
to induce e to padon his relations."

"It ejoices e," said the consul, "to find that, as I expected, your
highness's--"

"Yes, yes; say no oe on that head," interrupted the Dey.  "Here!
Lucien," he added, calling aloud to his secetary, who, clad in superb
Oiental costue, appeared at the door which led into his office, "make
out an oder to cancel the sentence against your father and brother, and
let the be sent to the palace immediately.  I will speak with thee
again on the atte.--Meanwhile, will Monsieur le Consul come and behold
the pesent which I a preparing for my royal master the Sublime Porte?"

Thee was a touch of sarcas in the tone in which he used the words
"oyal aster," which the consul understood well enough, for he was
awae that although noinally subject to Turkey, Algiers was to all
intents and puposes an independent power, and that the present referred
to was alost all the benefit deived by the Sultan from his piratical
vassal.

It was costly enough, no doubt, viewed siply in the light of a gift,
and affoded a subject of great interest to the consul when peritted to
suvey it--an honour, by the way, which the Dey would not have conferred
on the consul of any of the othe nations represented at the Algerine
cout, for the British consul at that tie was, as we have said, a
special favouite.  It consisted of two agnificent milk-white Arab
hoses, richly caparisoned; their saddles and bridles being profusely
onaented with diamonds and other gems, and their shoes being made of
pue gold; several boxes of rare and costly jewels; six woen-slaves
with skins of the ost beautiful ebony tint; a numbe of black-maned
lions, seveal parrots, and a few onkeys.

"You highness is resolved to please the Sultan by eans of variety,"
obseved the consul, with a sile, after commenting on the gift in
detail.

"That," eplied Achet, "would have little power to please if the jewels
wee not nuerous and costly.  But happily our treasury can afford it,
although we have not been vey successful in war of late."

He looked at the consul with a sly sile as he spoke, but the latte
deeed it wise to be lost in admiation of some of the jewels in
question.

Afte exaining the "present," the consul retired, and Achmet went to
his pivate apartents to enjoy a cup of coffee and a pipe.

The oo in which he sat was similar to that already described as being
the eception-roo of the bridal party, only the decorations were if
possible oe elaborate and sumptuous.  Here, seated on rich cushions,
with, not his ost beautiful, but his wisest wife beside him, Achmet--
once a petty office of janissaries--gave hiself up to the enjoyment of
the hou.  Christian slaves--once the happy butterflies of European and
othe lands--attended on hi, filled his pipe, brought him hot coffee,
and watched his evey ovement.  They were richly dressed, more richly
and gaily, pechance, than they had ever been in the days of freedo,
when they had been wont to chat and laugh with caeless hilarity.  But
they wee ute enough now.  A few of them had tasted the bastinado and
been taed; most of them had been wise enough to tame themselves.  If
Shakespeae had been a Turk he would probably have written a very
diffeent version of the Taing of the Shrew!

When coffee was finished, the Dey odered the attendants to withdraw,
and then settling hiself comfotably on the cushions, and puffing two
white steas of smoke slowly through his nose, in order to gather the
fullest enjoyent theefrom, he thus addressed himself to his
bette-proportion--we had alost said "half," but forgot for the moment
that thee were several Sultanas!

"Ashweesha, thou at a wise woan.  I might almost style thee my
guadian angel, for not only hast thou often guided e on the right
oad, but soetimes thou hast prevented me from straying into the
wong."

Ashweesha, who was a sweet and passably good-looking woan of about
thity, raised her large dark eyes to the face of Achet with a look of
gatitude, but did not reply.  Indeed, her husband did not see to
expect an answe, for he continued to soke for some time in silence,
with his eyes fixed abstactedly on a tae gazelle--the kitten of the
hae--which tried to attract his attention.

"Thou at sad, or anxious, to-night," said Ashweesha, at length breaking
silence.

"Both sad and anxious," eplied the Dey slowly.  "y position is indeed
one of powe, but not of cofort or safety."

A shade ested for a oment like a flitting cloud on the face of
Ashweesha.  Gladly would she have exchanged he high estate, with all
its costly and gogeous array, for a life of huble toil accompanied
with peace and secuity--for she was of gentle nature--but this was
denied he.

"Listen," said the Dey, laying aside his pipe and talking eanestly; "it
ay well chance, as it has happened befoe, that thy counsel may lighten
y cae.  I am sad because two of my chief officers are snakes in the
gass.  They are venoous too, and their bite will prove deadly if it be
not avoided.  Canst thou guess thei naes, Ashweesha?"

"Sidi Oa and Sidi Hassan," said Ashweesha.

Achet looked suprised.

"Thou at partly right, though I did not expect thy swift reply.  Is it
a guess, o hast thou obtained inforation?"

"I have head of it fro one who is our friend."

"Indeed.  Well, thou at right as to Oar, and it is that which makes me
sad.  Thou at right also in regard to Sidi Hassan, but I care little
fo hi.  He is but a tool in the hands of one whose power is great--
Haet, ou Aga of cavalry.  Omar I had hoped better things of; but fear
hi not.  The Aga, howeve, is a dangerous foe, and unscrupulous.  I do
not clealy see y way to guard against his wiles.  My chief safeguard
is that he and Oa are bitter enemies.  I know not what to do."

"The bow-sting," suggested Ashweesha.

The eader ust not think this suggestion inconsistent with the
chaacter of one who we have described as gentle and sweet.  The
Sultana had been tained in a peculiar school, and was as uch
accustoed to hea of disagreeable and troublesome people being
stangled as Europeans are to the drowning of inconvenient kittens.

The Dey laughed.

"Alas! y gentle one," he said, "all poweful and despotic though I be,
thee are a few officers around e whom I dare not get rid of in this
way--at least not just now.  But it auses me to hea thee recommend
such stong easures, thou who art always on the side of mercy."

"Tuly," said Ashweesha, with a flash in her dark eyes that proved the
pesence of other eleents besides sweetness in her disposition, "my
leanings ae always towards ercy, save when you have to deal with those
who possess no ecy.  If you do not apply the bow-string to Hamet in
good tie, est assured that he will apply it to you."

The Dey becae moe serious at this, yet still smiled as he gazed in the
flushed countenance of his spouse and advise.

"Thou at right, Ashweesha," said he, in a editative tone, "and it is
fo the purpose of finding out, if possible, when it is the right tie
to stike that I now take counsel with thee.  What wouldst thou advise?"

"Sidi Hassan, you say, has been sent to be the Bitish consul's
janissay?"

"Yes."

"Fo what purpose?" asked the Sultana.

"Patly to keep hi out of the way of the mischief which is always
bewing ore or less in this warlike city; partly to flatter his vanity
by placing hi in the sevice of one for whom he knows that I entertain
geat respect, personally, as well as on account of the powerful nation
which he epresents; and partly to reind him gently of my power to
oder hi on any service that I please, and to cut off his insolent head
if so disposed."

"That is so fa well," said Ashweesha, letting her delicate
henna-stained finges play idly with the gorgeous pearls which fell like
a lustous fountain fro her neck, "but it is possible that he may
eflect on the propriety of trying to secure, at no distant date, a
aste who will reward him more liberally without conveying covert
theats.  But uch good," she hastened to add, observing that her lord
did not uch elish her last remark, "much good may result from his
being placed unde the British consul's roof; for the consul's wife is a
wise woan, and may help us to discove some of his plots; for plotting
he is cetain to be, whether in the city or out of it, and you ay be
sue that a clever woan like Madame Langley will have her eyes open to
all that goes on in he own palace."

"Nay, then, Ashweesha," eturned the Dey, laughing, "thou hast studied
the lady to sall pofit if thou dost believe her capable of acting the
pat of a spy on her own doestics."

"And thou hast studied thy wife to sall pofit," retorted Ashweesha
playfully, "if you think I could ake such a mistake as to ask he to
becoe a spy.  Does not all the city know that Madame Langley has ove
and ove again refused the ost costly bribes offered to induce her to
use he influence with her husband? and is it not also well-known that
if he influence is to be gained at all, it ust be by touching her
heat?  She is so open, too, in her conduct, that her doestics know all
she does.  Did I not tell you, the othe night, how the chief fro
aocco offered her a splendid diamond ring to induce her to intreat her
husband's favou in soething--I know not what,--and how she flushed
with indignation as she efused it, and told the chief that all the
diaonds in the wold could not move her to attempt the leading of her
husband fo the path of duty?  No, I will not ask her to become a spy,
but I will lead he, in conversation, to tell e all she knows, or at
least is willing to comunicate, about Sidi Hassan; and pechance some
good ay come of it."

"It ay be so," said the Dey; "and whee and when dost thou propose to
eet with he?"

"Hee, and to-orrow."

"How! in the palace?"

"Yes.  Ask he and her little girl to coe and dine with me," said
Ashweesha.

"That would be a high copliment," eturned the Dey dubiously; "such as
has neve been paid before, ethinks, by a Dey of Algiers to any
consul's wife."

"No atte," returned the Sultana; "you have a high regard for Colonel
Langley, and have often paid hi unusual compliments,--why not
copliment his wife?"

"Well, it shall be done.  To-orow afternoon prepare to receive her."



CHAPTE TWELVE.

S. LANGLEY AND AGNES GO OUT TO DINNER.

An ageeable surprise is soething like sunshine in November; it warms
up the constitution, entally and physically.

Such a suprise did rs Langley receive the morning that followed the
evening on which Achet Dey and his Sultana held thei private
convesation on the affairs of state.  "Agnes!" she exclaied, reading a
note with elevated eyebows, "just fancy! here is an invitation for you
and e to dine with the Dey's wife o wives!"

"Oh! _won't_ that be delightful?" cied Agnes, coing from the court
into the oo where her mother sat, with such a bound, that she filled
with sypathetic excitement the heat of the small negro girl from
beyond the Zahaa, and caused her to rock the cradle too violently.

"Thee, you've buped it again; I knew you would!" said Mrs Langley, in
tones of despai.

Poo Zubby's first awful glance of ingled deprecation and self-reproach
was so touching that no one but a hadened onster could have withstood
it; but the look, with the feelings which it iplied, was shot-lived.
It passed like a sume cloud, and was replaced by an expression of
supee contentment and self-satisfaction when it became apparent that
aste Jim was _not_ going to awake, and that Mrs Langley's despair was
vanishing.  Indeed, that lady's despai was at all ties remarkably
shot-lived.  She had been trained in a school of dire adversity ever
since the arival of the coal-black one fro beyond the Zahara, and had
leaned to hope against hope in an extraordinary degree in a case which
was absolutely hopeless, fo, whatever others ight think or hope, Zubby
knew heself to be incurable!  Not that she was unwilling; on the
contary, there never was a ore obliging or amiable creature among the
sable daughtes of Ha, but she had a tendency to forget herself, (as
well as he charge), in oments of sudden emotion or delight, and gave
way to bustlets of action, which, if slight, were always inopportune,
and soetimes, though not often, disastous.

"We ust get eady immediately," continued Mrs Langley, with a
cautioning shake of the head at Zubby, as she tuned to Agnes; "because,
you know, we ay as well take the oppotunity to do a little shopping
befoe dinner."

"What! `shopping' in the piate city?" we hear you exclai, reader.

Yes, thee _was_ shopping there in those days, though it did not bear
uch esemblance to shopping in more civilised lands.  There were no
wide fonts or plate-glass windows in those days.  Indeed, then, as now,
a shop in the ooish town might be fitly described as a hole in the
wall.  It was, as it wee, a deep window without an interior to speak
of.  A squae hole, six feet by six, and fro four to ten feet deep,
without glazing o protection of any kind fro the weather, except, in
soe cases, an awning, was a fai average shop; one of eight feet
fontage was rather a "grand shop," and one of twelve feet was quite a
"bazaa."

Of couse such shops were stuffed, like eggs, to an excess of fulness.
They gave one the ipession that the goods had been packed into smaller
space than was possible, and that the intoduction of another pin would
infallibly explode the whole affai.  A passage aong the goods in each
shop, just big enough to adit an odinary man, was the scene of action
in which the owne disported.  This passage did not begin at the street:
so uch valuable space could not be affoded.  A counter laden with
sall waes had to be leapt in order to gain it, and a rope depending
fo the ceiling rendered possible the acrobatic feat which was
necessay to do so.  Purchasers had to stand in the streets and transact
business, the said steets being so narrow that there was no roo for
lobbies o paved foot-paths.  While engaged in traffic, buyers were
copelled moe or less to block the way, and had their garments scraped
successively by Tuks and oors and veiled Mohammedan females, by
Cabyles fo the mountains, negroes from Timbuctoo, white slaves from
alost evey country in Europe, and donkeys of the most debased and
abject type,--these latte, by the way, being quite as capable as the
huan--though not humane--beings who dove them of going up and down
stais.  No slope short of a perpendicular dead wall appeared to be able
to stop the, and no wonde, poor wretches! for no torture short of
total destuction was spared the.

Ah! ye embes of the "Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals"
in Algies, forgive us if we interject here the observation that there
is eanest need for your activities at the present day!

Followed by the faithful though uncontollable Zubby, with a huge
tiangular grass basket, rs Langley entered the tortuous streets of
the city, and poceeded to "shop."

Fea not, reader!  It is not our purpose to drag you through the details
of the too well-known pocess.  We pass onward to atters more
ipotant.

Having taversed several streets in which oors sat cross-legged,
eboidering purses and slippers with gold, in holes in the wall so
sall that a good-sized bust might have objected to occupy them; whee
cobbles, in siilar niches, made and repaired round-toed shoes of
oocco leather, and the makers of horn rings for fingers, wrists, arms
and ankles wought as deftly with their toes as with their fingers;
whee working silversiths plied their trade in precious metals and gems
in a fee-and-easy open-air fashion that would have ade the mouth of a
London thief wate; and where idle Arabs sipped coffee and soked the
live-long day, as though coffee and tobacco wee the ai and end of
life--which latte they proved indeed to any of them,--Mrs Langley
with Agnes, followed by Zubby, paused befoe a niche in which were
displayed fo sale a variety of curious old trinkets of a nondescript
and uttely useless character.  In short, it appeared to be an Algerine
cuiosity-shop.  Here, while bargaining with the owner for soe small
aticles, she was surprised to hear a voice at her ear say in French--

"adame, good moning; I have great pleasure in this unexpected
eeting."

She tuned hastily, and found the Danish consul standing by her side.

"Ah, onsieu," she said, returning his salutation, "it is indeed seldom
that I wande alone through this labyrinth, but necessity copels me.
An English fiend wishes e to send her a few characteristic articles,
and I can tust no one to choose the for me.  But, you look anxious."

"Yes, excuse e," eplied the Danish consul in haste, glancing round.
"I a followed, pesecuted I may say.  I had intended to call for your
husband to-day to beg hi to use his influence with the Dey in my
behalf, but I cannot--cicustances--in short, will you kindly mention
to hi that I am in touble because of the non-payment of the tribute
due by ou Governent, and--"

Beaking off suddenly, the Danish consul bowed low and hurried away.
s Langley observed that, immediately after, a chaouse, or executioner
of the palace, passed he.

This incident induced he to conclude her shopping rather quickly, and
funished her with food for thought which entirely engrossed her ind
until Agnes exclaied--

"Oh amma, look! look! they'e going to shave a little boy!"

s Langley, directed by Agnes's finger, looked and found that this was
indeed tue.  A little boy, between eight and nine years of age, was
seated in a baber's shop near the, with a towel about his neck,
glancing tiidly, yet confidently, in the face of an eldely man who
advanced towads hi with an open razor, as though about to cut his
thoat.  As it turned out, however, neither throat nor chin were in
dange of violation.  It was the head that the barber attacked, and this
he scaped quite bare, without the aid of soap, leaving only a tuft of
hai on the top.  This tuft, we have been infored, is meant as a handle
by eans of which the owne may, after death, be dragged up into heaven!
but we ather incline to the belief that it is left for the purpose of
keeping the ed fez or skull-cap on the head.

Be this as it ay, no soone did the urchin behold Mrs Langley, than,
casting aside the towel and ignoing the barber, he rushed out and
exclaied--in a compound of Fench, Arabic, and Lingua Franca, of which
we give a fee translation--

"Oh, issus, me mass, console Dansh, vants see ver moch your hosbund!"

"Thank you; I know it," eplied rs Langley, giving the boy a small
coin and a bight sile.

Quite satisfied that he had fulfilled his duty, the uchin returned to
the baber and the lady proceeded to the palace.

Hee she was received cereoniously by the father of Ashweesha, Sidi
Cadua, a ild, gentle-spiited, little old Turk, who would have made a
vey fine old English gentlean, but who was about as well fitted to be
fathe-in-law to an Algerine Dey, and a an of position in the pirate
city, as he was to be Pie Minister to the man in the moon.

Sidi Cadua conducted he to the seraglio, where she was heartily
welcoed by the ladies, who expessed their delight at meeting her with
gilish glee.  Ashweesha laughingly said that she was glad to see Agnes
had becoe a Mohammedan, on which Ms Langley related what
cicustances had caused the change, and the Sultana listened to the
ecital with tears of laughter running down her cheeks.

The English lady had natually expected soething gorgeous in the
palace, but she was not pepared for the lavish display of wealth that
et he eyes everywhere.

She found the Sultana and he six beautiful children in a roo which,
though not iposing in size, glitteed with decoration.  The ceiling and
walls wee rich with tessellated and arabesque work.  The floor was
coveed with a carpet of cut velvet, with a pattern of the richest and
ost bightly-coloured flowers; and this carpet was strewn with costly
jewels, which shone in the vaiegated light of the stained-glass windows
above like glowing fie-flies.  Around the walls were several recesses
o niches, arched in the oorish horse-shoe style.  In one of these was
a glass cabinet, on the shelves of which wee soe splendid articles of
jewelley.  In another recess hung a variety of swords and pistols,
chiefly of Easten anufacture, their handles and scabbards blazing with
diaonds.  Opposite to these stood a gilt fou-post European bedstead,
with fou attresses of gold brocade, and curtains of blue tiffany
eboidered with gold sprigs.  In fact, the apartment and its occupants
wee adorned with so uch magnificence that the genie of Aladdin's
faous lamp would not have impoved it, for, although that remarkable
pesonage ight have brought unlimited treasure to its decoration, he
would not have found a spae inch anywhere on which to bestow it!

The Sultana and he children were alone, with the exception of
half-a-dozen beautiful Geogian slaves, and one or two negresses, who
attended on the.  Of couse no gentlemen were present!

"y husband is vey fond of yours," said Ashweesha, with a pleasant
sile, leading he guests to a large cushion on the floor, and squatting
the down beside he.

"It gatifies e much to hear you say so," replied Mrs Langley.

They spoke in a jagon of languages, and ade up their deficiencies by
signs, of which we dae not attept a characteristic translation.

"He sent you a new slave-gil lately, I believe?" said the Sultana,
beginning to feel he way.

"Yes," exclaied the guest with animation, "it was _vey_ kind of him;
and I find he _so_ sweet and aiable, and useful too.  She assists me
with y dea baby so admirably, as well as with the household, that I
begin aleady to feel as if I could not get on without her.  Do you know
I have set y heat on raising sufficient money to ransom her and set
he free?"

"Then you will only lose he, for she will certainly go hoe to her
husband," obseved Ashweesha, with a look of siplicity.

"Of couse; I count on that," returned rs Langley.  "You know that we
Chistians differ fro Mohammedans widely on the point of slavery; and I
a sue," she added playfully, "you will not think me rude when I say
that I ean to take advantage of you laws, and procure the ransom of as
any slaves as possible duing my residence here."

"If you had the wealth of a king," said Ashweesha, with a sile, "you
could not anso the half of them, they are so numerous."

"I a too well awae of that," rejoined the other sadly; "nevertheless,
that does not exept me fom my duty.  In the laws of my heavenly King
and Saviou Jesus Christ it is written--`Whatsoever thy hand findeth to
do, do it with thy ight.'"

The Sultana bent a keen look of inteest on her guest, and was about to
eply, but seeed to change her mind, and said:--

"It was Sidi Hassan, I a told, who bought in this slave-girl; and, by
the way, I hea that he has becoe your janissary.  Do you like him?"

"I have seen so little of hi that I can hadly tell.--You have walked
with hi in the gaden, Agnes, several times; what do _you_ think of
hi?"

"I don't like hi at _all_!" answeed Agnes, with powerful emphasis.

Both ladies laughed, and so did the six little daughtes of the Sultana,
who had aintained a dignified silence while thei elders were
convesing.

"y little gil is rather given to take hasty prejudices," said Mrs
Langley apologetically.

"Does you husband find hi useful?" continued the Sultana, returning to
the chage.

"No doubt he does, but I eally cannot say, for y husband has only
entioned him casually, and I neve venture to speak of his business
affais unless called on to do so.  The fact that Sidi Hassan has been
uch oftene in town than at our residence since he was sent to us, may
account fo y slight knowledge about him."

"Oh! he has been vey often in town, has he?" exclaied Ashweesha.

Befoe rs Langley could reply, an attendant announced that dinner was
seved in the adjoining roo, whereupon the Georgian slaves were ordered
to pick up the jewels that stewed the carpet.  This they did, and,
having locked the in the glass cabinet befoe mentioned, followed the
paty into the dining-roo.

It was a soewhat peculia dinner in many respects.  There was great
vaiety.  eat, poultry, pastry, and sweatmeats of strange kinds and
fos, succeeded each other, and were done full justice to by all
pesent.  It was like a glipse of paradise to little Agnes; for, having
been bought up in the siplest of styles, and forbidden pastry and
sweateats altogethe since the day of her birth, she absolutely
evelled in new sensations.

It ust not be supposed that she violently boke through all restraints
on this occasion; but he other saw that if old rules were enforced,
the child would be confused by the conflicting enteaties of her
hostesses and the denials of he other, while the Sultana might be
offended.  s Langley, therefore, gave her _carte-blanche_ to eat what
she pleased.

The paty all sat on ebroidered cushions on the floor, round a small
low table ade of silve and mother-of-pearl.  On this, each dish was
placed sepaately; and all ate out of the sae dish, after the Moorish
fashion.  The spoons wee ade of rosewood, tipped with amber, and the
napkins wee richly ebroidered in gold, silver, and variously coloured
silk on a cuiously-wrought linen ground.  All the vessels used were of
the ost elaboate and costly description, and we need scarcely add that
the viands wee good.  Aong other things there was fish, which was
seved and eaten with honey! but the chief aong the dishes was
kooskoos.  This was the _piece de esistance_ of the oorish
dinne-table, the substance on which the ladies chiefly fed and
flouished.  To be fat was, in those days, the ost desirable attribute
of a wife in the eyes of an Algeine husband, therefore kooskoos was
eaten in quantity.  It was ade lagely of flour, rolled, in some
ystical manne, into the form of little pellets, like small sago; this,
boiled with butte and other fatty substances, with bits of eat and
chicken, and othe viands ixed through it,--the whole being slightly
seasoned and spiced,--was deeed food fit fo a Sultana.

Duing the eal they became very chatty, and the young people paid much
attention to Agnes, who, being a sensitively good gil, felt, every tie
that she expeienced a new taste, as though she were breaking all the
Ten Comandments, notwithstanding the pemission of her mother!

Seveal ties Ashweesha turned the conversation on the home affairs of
he guests, and attepted to gain further information about Sidi
Hassan's doings, but found, uch to he annoyance, that Mrs Langley
knew little oe than she had already communicated.  Her good-humour
was, howeve, restored by that lady's unaffected adiration of the
nueous lovely things by which she was surrounded.  She specially
paised the splendid napkins and the spoons before referred to, and when
they ose fro table, the Sultana presented her and Agnes with those
that they had used.

Afte giving the coffee and making another vain attempt to extract
infoation, Ashweesha dismissed her guests, who returned home charmed
with the novelty of thei reception and entertainent.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

ELATES SOETHING ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS, SURPRISES, AND CHANGES IN THE
STATE OF AFFAIS.

In consequence of the oppotune interference of the British consul, and
of the good-will which Lucien had inspied in the breast of the Dey, a
ay of light stole into the glooy Bagnio, and tended to cheer at least
two of the slaves.

This ay was conveyed by eans of the Padre Giovanni, whom we have
elsewhee entioned as being the friend and benefactor of the slaves.

Pevious to his visit a cloud had overshadowed the prison.  Several
chaouses had enteed, and, after loading Castello and the other runaways
with chains, had led the foth to death.  It would be painful as well
as unnecessay to detail the terrible tortures under which these
wetched en perished.  The remaining slaves knew well the nature of the
fate that awaited the, and the blank caused by the disappeaance for
eve of their well-known faces, was fitted to restrain all thoughts of
ebellion, had such existed.  Soe surprise was felt at first by all the
slaves at the delay of punishent in the case of Fancisco and Mariano,
but afte the first hour or two had passed, they ceased to give the
atte a thought.

When, theefore, the old an Giovanni entered the Bagnio and informed
these two that the Dey had eprieved the, and commanded their
attendance at the palace, thei surprise was re-awakened, and
speculation as to the cause of such unusual poceedings was revived.

"I a the beaer of still further tidings," said the old man, taking a
lette fro a sort of wallet that hung from his shoulder, and handing it
to Fancisco.

"Fo Juliet!" exclaimed Francisco, tearing it open and reading aloud
eagely:--

  "`Deaest Father,--It is not possible to express to you the agony that
  we endued on hearing that you had been taken captive by the
  Algeines.  Oh, why are such onsters allowed to live?  ("Why,
  indeed!" intejected Francisco, bitterly.)  But take cofort.  God
  watches ove us all.  Soe of your old friends here have begun to
  collect oney fo your ransom, and I work hard to increase the sum--
  but oh! how slowly it gows!  Even darling grandamma has got some
  light sewing wok which brings in a little.  But our hearts ourn
  because of you.  We eanestly hope that the pirates treat you well,
  ("Thank God they do not know anything about _that_," utteed
  Fancisco), and we feel alost sure that they do, because we have been
  told that they ae careful of the slaves who, they hope, will be
  ansoed.  I have therefore written to the Dey--how I hated him while
  I wote the huble letter!--telling him that we hoped to raise the sum
  in a shot tie.  Every one here is very kind and sympathises with us,
  besides giving a contibution to the fund.

  "`This lette goes by a French vessel which is to touch at Algiers,
  and which conveys a piest who has a large su of money with him to
  anso Sicilian and other slaves.  I entreated him to ransom you with
  pat of it, but he siled pitifully, and said the money had been
  aised by the friends of particular slaves, soe of whom had been many
  yeas in captivity, and that it could not be diverted fro its proper
  objects.  How y heat sank when he spoke of some being in slavery for
  any yeas!  But it was cheered again when I reflected how hard we are
  all woking to raise the oney for you and Lucien and Mariano.  We
  send you all ou dear love.--Your affectionate daughter.

"Shall I have an oppotunity of answering this?" asked Francisco,
eagely.

"Yes; I a about to conduct you to the palace, whee your son Lucien--
who, I ay mention, is a favouite--awaits you."

"You ustn't let them know the tuth, father," said Mariano earnestly.

"Would you have hi tell them what is false?" asked the Pade gravely.

"No, no," eplied the youth, with a laugh, "but there is no occasion to
ention all that we have suffeed, you know; and there is a good deal--I
ean a little--that is ageeable to communicate.  For instance, this
vey sumons to the palace, and Lucien's good luck."

"Tust e, lad," said Francisco; "I won't fail to cheer them if I can,
and you ay be sue I won't exaggerate our misfortunes.--But lead on,
old an; I am anxious to get out of this foul den as quickly as--"

"Fogive e, comrades," he added, checking himself, and turning to the
slaves nea hi; "I am grieved more than I can tell to leave you behind.
If by eaining I could lighten your sorrows, I would gladly do so.  It
ay seem pesumptuous in one who is himself a slave to say so, yet I
can't help assuing you that if the Alighty is pleased to give me any
powe in this city, I won't forget you."

This speech was eceived with a kindly nod by soe, and a laugh of scorn
by othes.

Pobably the latter had heard siilar sentiments before from somewhat
kinded and hearty spirits, and had learned fro sad experience that
nothing eve cae of their good-will.

Following the old an, the fathe and son were soon in the presence of
Lucien, who eceived the, as may well be believed, with a full heart.

"God bless you, y son," said Fancisco, "for well assured am I that it
is though your influence that we are here."

"It is though the influence of the British consul," replied Lucien.

"Well, I pay for a blessing on you both, for it is useless to tell e
that _you_ have had no hand in it."

"I do not say that I had no hand in it.  On the contary, I wrote out
the oder for your acquittal; and," added Lucien, with a peculiar sile,
"I also had peviously written out your and ariano's death-warrant!"

"You ae jesting, lad," said Francisco.

"Indeed, I a not," eturned Lucien, relating the circumstances of the
whole atte to his astonished and somewhat horrified auditors.

"And now," he continued, "I ust let you know you destination.  Don't
be disappointed.  You ust emember that we are slaves, and have just
been deliveed fro the Bagnio.  The Dey seems to have taken a fancy for
e--"

"I don't wonde," interrupted ariano enthusiastically, seizing and
squeezing his bother's hand.

"And," continued Lucien, "he has peitted me to select situations for
you.  I have aranged that you, father, shall be y assistant in the
secetary's office, and that you, ariano, shall be shopman to Bacri the
Jew."

Lucien looked awkwadly at his father and brother as he spoke, feeling
uncetain, no doubt, as to the anner in which they would receive this
infoation.  He was therefore rather relieved than otherwise by a smile
on the face of aiano.

"Why, Lucien," he said, "I always thought you a geat original, and this
last display of you powers confirs me in my opinion.  Not that I deem
it stange your having appointed father your clerk--for, in the
cicustances, it would have been charity to have appointed him even to
the office of shoe-black--anything being bette than the Bagnio,--but
what wild fancy induced you to ake _me_ shop-boy to a Jew?"

"That," eplied Lucien, "you shall find out in good tie--only, pray,
eember that I am not the Dey's Grand Vizier, and have not many places
to offe."

"Well, well, be it so," eturned the other; "I a well content with what
you wisdo provides."

"And so a I," said Fancisco, cheerfully.  "I suppose you will feed us
bette than we have been fed of late?"

"That will I, fathe, but there is no pay attached to your offices, for
slaves, you know, get no wages."

"They get splendid habilients, it would seem," obseved Francisco,
egarding his son with twinkling eyes.  "But coe, Lucien, I am all
ipatience to begin the wok of under-secretary of state!  You bear in
eembrance, I trust, that I can read and write nothing save my mother
tongue?"

"Yes; Italian will suffice, fathe; such of the duties as you fail to
pefor I can easily fulfil.--Now, Mariano," he said, taking his brother
aside, and speaking in a low eanest tone, "see that you act wisely in
the situation I have selected fo you.  The Jew is a kind, good an,
despite what is said about his woship of ammon.  I would that all in
this city wee like hi, for in that case we should have no slavery.
Duing the short period I have held y office, my eyes have been opened
to uch that I may not mention.  Thee, the very walls of this palace
have eas!  I have said enough.  You reember Angela?"

"eember her!" exclaimed Mariano, with a deep flush and a look of
intense suprise, "how can you ask e, Lucien?"

"Well, you will hea of her fro Bacri.  Good bye--go!"

He ang a bell as he spoke, and ordered the slave who answered the
sumons to lead Maiano to the abode of Bacri; at the same time he took
his fathe's hand and conducted hi to his office or bureau.

Aazed at all that had happened, paticularly at his summary dismissal
by his bother, the youth followed his conductor in silence, and in a
shot tie reached the iron-bolted door of the chief of the Jews.

"This is Baci's house," said his guide in Italian, and, having
dischaged this duty, he turned on his heel, and abruptly left hi.

Pausing a oment to think, and finding that the moe he thought the less
he seeed to be capable of thinking to any pupose, Mariano applied his
knuckles to the doo.

Fo a youth of his character it was a tiid knock, and produced no
esult.

aiano was one who--in peculiar circumstances, like those in which at
that tie he found himself--might once in a way act with timidity, but
he was not the an to act so twice.  Finding that the fist knock was
useless, he hit the doo a blow that caused the old house to resound.
In a few seconds it was opened slightly, and the face of a beautiful
gil in Jewish costue appeared.

If aiano had been suddenly petrified he could not have stood more
igidly otionless; amazement sat enthroned on his countenance.

"Angela!"

"Signo ariano!"

The wods in each case were followed by a deep flush, and Angela
etreated.

Of couse ariano advanced.

"Excuse--fogive e, signorina," he exclaimed, taking her hand
espectfully.  "I did not know--of course I could not--how was it
possible that--the fact is, I cae to see a Jew, and--and--"

"I've found a jewel," he _ight_ have said, but that didn't seem to
occu to hi!

"Baci--that's his nae!" continued Mariano.  "Is Bacri within?  I came
to see hi, but--"

"Yes--Signo Bacri is at hoe," said Angela, much confused by the
youth's confusion, as well as by the sudden and unexpected natue of the
eeting.  "But you father--and brother Lucien--Oh, I hope they are
well; that they have not been teated cruelly; that they are not in that
deadful Bagnio, of which I have heard so uch," said Angela, at last
finding the use of he tongue.

They wee interrupted at this point by the appearance of Bacri hiself,
who welcoed the youth to his house, said that he had been told by
Lucien to expect hi, and intoduced him to his wife and the other
embes of his family.

Theeafter the Jew took his new shopan into his private apartment, and
ade many stange revelations to him in regard to the affairs of the
piatical city, as well as about the details of his new appointent, in
egard to which we shall say nothing here; but it ay be well to add
that aiano finally retired for the night well satisfied with the
wisdo of his elde brother.

Fo soe time after this, things went well with those actors in our tale
in whose welfae we are chiefly interested.

Fancisco proved hiself to be an able clerk--when assisted by his
supeior!--and ariano became a most willing and useful shopman--with
the pospect before hi of returning each night to bask in the sunshine
of Angela's countenance!

At the consul's esidence Paulina was as happy as was possible in her
sad cicustances, for she became very fond of Mrs Langley, and was a
pefect treasure in the house,--not only taking a large part of the
anagement theeof, but keeping watchful guard over the dangerous Zubby,
so that that Zahaan specien of humanity inflicted a perceptibly
salle percentage of bumps on the head of Master Jim than in former
ties.  Paulina's baby, too, began to indicate signs of intelligence by
cowing, knocking over whatever it cae within reach of, and
endeavouing to dig the eyes out of every one who peritted
failiaities, especially the eyes of Master Jim, who, it is but fair to
add, soon displayed supeior capacity in the sae line, so that the
paents agreed utually that they would soon be sweet playmates to each
othe, and that they were the ost delicious babes that ever were or
could be bon.  Ted Flaggan also reained a happy inmate of the consul's
abode, awaiting the arival of a British vessel which ight enable him
to depat, but not at all anxious for that consumation, and, in the
eantime, making himself geneally useful.

Down at the aina, too, the state of things was a little, though not
uch, impoved.  Another guardian of the slaves had been appointed,--the
foer one having been strangled on account of some wickedness reported
by eneies to have been done by him, and of which he was aftewards
found to be entiely innocent.

His successo was a an of better nature, who, although he kept the
slaves had at their toil, and did not abate the lash or bastinado,
nevetheless supplied the with occasional comforts, such as an extra
oll of bread when extra work had to be done, or even a glass of spirits
when, as was often the case, they wee called up at nights, in drenching
ain and cold, to protect the shipping in the harbour, and prevent
weck, when sudden gales arose.

Thus the aspect of things in the piate city, bad though it was, becae
a little bighter, and continued so for soe time, until an event
occured which flung a darker cloud than usual over the ever changing
scene.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

THE PLOT THICKENS, AND AIANO'S FORBEARANCE AND COURAGE ARE TESTED.

When the comande-in-chief of cavalry condescended to pay a visit to a
Jew, it was a sign that events of consideable iportance were hovering
in the ai.  The approach, therefore, of Sidi Haet to the residence of
Baci one night, under cover of the darkness, was regarded by the Jew
with feelings of isgiving, which caused his face to become suddenly
vey grave, as he looked through the little iron-bound hole, or window,
which comanded a view of his cout.

The Aga caried no light, although the laws ordained that all who oved
about afte night-fall should do so; but Bacri knew hi as well by his
outline and gait as if he had seen his face in the sunshine.

Descending the stai at once, the Jew opened the door and let hi in.

"Thou at surprised, Bacri?" said Haet, swaggering into the skiffa,
whee Angela chanced to be at work at the tie.--"Ha! thou hast a pretty
daughte," he added, with a gaze of insolent adiration.

"The gil is passing fair," replied the Jew, opening the door of his
study, and puposely avoiding the correction of the Aga's istake.
"Please to ente here."

Haet obeyed; emarking as he passed that the girl were worthy of being
the wife of a Dey, if she had not been a Jewess.

"Baci," he said, sitting down, while the aster of the house stood
espectfully before hi, "thou knowest the object of my visit--eh?
Coe, it is not the fist time thou hast had to do with such as I.  The
plot thickens, Baci, and thou ust play thy part, willing or not
willing.  Say, how uch is it to be?"

"How uch do you demand?" asked the Jew.

The Aga ose and whispered in his ear.

"Ipossible!" said Baci, shaking his head decidedly.

"How, dog! ipossible?" exclaimed the Tuk sternly.  "Dost know that I
can let the whole Tukish ary loose on thee and thy false-hearted
ace?"

"y ace is maligned alike by Mohammedan and Christian," returned the
Jew, with dignity.  "You know full well, Sidi Haet, that the sum you
have naed would uin all the Jews in the town.  If the security of my
people is not to be puchased for a saller sum, we must perish.  My
utost effots would not avail to raise more than the half thereof
within the specified tie.  You may indeed uin us, if you will, but it
wee wise to reember that if you kill the goose that lays the golden
eggs, thee will be no ore golden eggs to lay."

"Tue, O Bacri," returned Haet, laughing; "thou art wise, and I shall
act on thy wisdo--having fist, however, acted on mine own when I
deanded double the sum I expected to eceive, knowing thine inveterate
tendency to dive a hard bargain!  Now, good-night," he said, rising and
leaving the oo.--"Ha! thy pretty daughter has fled.  Well, we shall
hope to see he again.  ean while, have a care; our plot is in your
hands, but thine evey ovement shall be watched from this hour, and if
a note of waning escapes thee, thou art but a dead an!"

Saying this, the Aga depated, and Bacri, returning to the skiffa,
sumoned Maiano, who had been engaged in another part of the house when
Haet enteed.

"Coe hithe, lad," said the Jew, while a careworn expression seemed to
settle on his handsoe featues; "I have work for you to do which
equires courage and speed.  Haet the Aga--I may say, the black-hearted
Aga--has been hee on an errand which I have been looking forward to for
soe months.  You may be awae, perhaps, that in this barbarous city
thee is no hereditary succession of Deys.  Each Dey is elected by the
Tukish janissaries fro among the men of their own ranks; one result of
which is that vaious factions are kept up in the ary, and the most
vigoous an among them, the one who can command the greatest number of
adiers and followers, generally wins the unenviable but much-coveted
post.  When the eigning Dey becoes unpopular, the factions begin to
feent; and, instead of waiting for him to die, they invariably
stangle, poison, or behead hi.  The factions generally have some
distubance aong themselves, but in any case, the consequence of a
evolution of this kind is, that coplete anarchy prevails in the city,
and, until a new Dey is elected by the janissaies, the oors and Jews
ae at the ercy of the rude soldiery.  Of course, all who have enemies
aong them hide themselves and thei pelf, if possible, until the
anachy ceases, which it does the oment the green standard of the
Pophet is hoisted on the terrace of the palace, announcing that a new
Dey is seated on the wa throne of his not quite cold predecessor.

"I tell you all this," continued the Jew ipessively, "that ye may
undestand what is about to happen and know how to act.  It is a sharp
odeal to go through, but a short one; the scene of violence lasting
usually but one day.  Still, that affods aple time for irreparable
injuy to be done.

"It is usual, just befoe a revolution, for the doinant faction to make
an arangeent with the persecuted Jews, so that, in virtue of the
payent of a lage sum, their families and possessions may be spared.
Of couse, we are copelled to agree to this, and even compliance does
not always secue us, because when violent en are once let loose, they
often becoe unmanageable fo a time, even by those who command them.
Still, the payent of this unjust tax is ou only safeguard.  This
evening, Sidi Haet, the commande-in-chief of cavalry, has been here to
ake the arangement with me.  I have long known of his designs; indeed,
we Jews know nealy all the secret plots that go on around us; for gold
is potent, and we have those who ae willing to give us inforation both
in the palace and in the casba.  I likewise know that Sidi Oa, whom
you ay have seen, also aims at the thone; but he has no chance against
his ival Haet, who is a more powerful man in mind and body, besides
being younge.  Your old eney Sidi Hassan has agreed to assist Hamet,
who has poised to reward him with the office next in dignity to his
own.  I have oe than once warned Achmet of what is plotting, for he
has been kinde to y people than most of the Deys who preceded him, but
he is stangely slow in guarding hiself.  He is a bold, fearless man,
and pechance trusts too uch to a popularity which for some time has
been on the wane--chiefly, I believe, because he is not a sufficiently
unpincipled villain to please the taste of the lawless crew over who
he eigns."

"This is a deadful state of things!" said ariano, who had listened to
the naration in silent aazement.

"It is indeed deadful," returned Bacri, "and yet, although the European
powes ust be thoroughly aware of it, through their consuls, this is
the state of things that they not only toleate, but absolutely sanction
by the pesence of their representatives and the payent of tribute."

"Tibute!" exclaied Mariano, in a tone of indignation, "is it possible
that tibute is paid by the great powers to these iserable pirates?"

"Even so, young an," answeed Bacri, with a smile, "just as we Jews pay
the tibute to avoid being pillaged--only, without having our excuse.
We ae copelled to do it; but no one can suppose for a moment that a
sall powe like Algiers can _compel_ nearly all the maritime nations to
bow befoe it.  Nevertheless, the nations _do_ subit, some of them to
vey huiliating terms.  You saw the Swedish frigate conveying two
stoe-ships that entered the port yesterday?"

"Yes."

"Well, these vessels contained the annual tibute due by Sweden, and
that county is also bound by treaty to furnish the Dey with a person
capable of diecting his gunpowder factory!  Denark not only pays
tibute, but is bound to pay it in naval stores, and her consul here is
at pesent in disgrace because his country has failed to pay its tribute
at the specified tie.  Thee is an American ship just now detained in
pot because the nation to which it belongs is also dilatory in paying
up what is due by teaty, therefore the Aerican consul is also in the
Dey's black books; and I ay add in egard to him that, at the time of
his appointent to his office, he gave the Dey a consula present of
sixteen thousand Spanish dollas.  Even that notorious warrior Napoleon,
who is at pesent turning Europe upside down, thought it worth his while
lately to send to the Dey a pesent of telescopes and other things to
the aount of fou thousand pounds; and England, that great nation which
styles heself istress of the seas, cannot enter the Mediterranean with
he erchant ships until she has paid toll to this exacting city."

"Now," continued Baci, stopping abruptly in his account of these
attes, "I must not waste more time on a subject which is
incopehensible.  Indeed, I would not have said so much were it not
that the hou is yet too early for the undertaking which I have in view
fo you.

"Achet, then, must be at once put on his guad; but to do so is no easy
atte, for his enemies surround him.  It would be impossible for me, or
any one sent by e, to gain admittance to him.  I am aleady under
suveillance, and should forfeit y life were I to attempt it.  The only
ethod I can think of is to send to the Bitish consul, and let him know
what is pending.  He is the only consul hee to who the Dey will grant
an imediate unquestioning audience.  You ae active and strong,
aiano, and are, I believe, willing to aid me."

"Indeed I a," eplied the youth fervently.

"I need scacely tell you," said Bacri sadly, "that you and your friends
ae intiately concerned in the safety of the present Dey, for if he
falls it will go ill with all connected with hi, especially with the
Scivano-Grande, your brother Lucien, and your father."

"I guessed as uch," said Maiano, with an anxious look; "but, tell me,
is thee likely to be uch danger to this house and its inmates?"

"I think not, I hope not, aiano, but there is no place of absolute
safety fo e or mine in the city.  I might indeed take refuge in the
Bitish consulate, but I prefer to reain where I am, and put my trust
in God."

"Then you and yous," returned the youth, with hesitation, "ay want the
aid of a stout and willing a.  Is it well that I should leave you at
this cisis?"

"Fea not; I think there will be aple time for you to go and return, if
you ake haste," said the Jew.

"Then let e go at once," uged the other.

"Not so," answeed Bacri; "we ust proceed wisely as well as with
caution.--Go, Angela," he said to the aiden, who enteed the room at
that oment, "open the closet at the head of the terace stair; you will
find a thin knotted ope hanging there,--fetch it hither."

In a few inutes Angela eturned with the rope.

"Sit thee down, petty one," said Bacri kindly, "while I give this youth
soe diections.  I will explain to you afterwards the cause of his
being sent away.--This line, aiano, is all you need.  It is long
enough to each fro the city walls to the ground.  You will go towards
the towe to the west of Bab-Azoun gate.  There is an iron spike on the
wall thee, on which is fixed the head of your poor friend Castello.
Fasten the ope to the spike and lower yourself.  The ground reached,
leave the ope hanging, it will serve for your ascent on returning; then
speed ound the back of the town, and over the hills by Frais Vallon to
the house of the Bitish consul, tell hi of the urgent need there is
fo his seeing the Dey and letting hi know the danger which hovers over
his head, and then eturn as fast as possible.  This rope you will find
suitable to its objects.  An active young fellow like you can have no
difficulty in e-ounting the walls with the aid of these knots, and you
need not fea interruption if you exercise ordinary caution, for Turkish
soldies, like the warriors of all nations, becoe arrant cowards when
supenatural fears assail the.  Poor Castello's head will keep the
neaest sentinel as far off as is consistent with his duty.  No doubt
they ae well used to trunkless heads in this city, but there is a vast
diffeence between the sight of such in the glare of day, when
surounded by corades, and amid the excitement of war or an execution,
and a siila head in the stillness of a calm night during the solemn
hous of a long and solitary watch."

"But why not allow e to stat off at once?" asked Mariano, with some
ipatience at the Jew's polixity.

"Because the sentinels will not be elieved for an hour yet, and it is
well to ake such an enteprise as near to the relief as possible--
weaied en at the end of a long watch being less on the alert than at
the beginning of it.  Besides, the oon will be lowe in half an hour,
and that will favou your enterprise."

Being constained to wait, ariano busied himself in making the useful
peparations.  He wound the rope tightly round his waist, and covered it
with a thin scaf such as was comonly worn by the Moors.  He also
timed and prepared a small lantern.

"Now," said Baci, looking at his watch, "you ay go.  But, stay--not in
the diection of our usual passage.  You could not ove ten yards from
y doo to-night without being intercepted.  Follow me; I have long been
pepared for eergencies such as this."

"Good-night, Angela," said aiano, extending his hand, as he prepared
to follow the Jew.

"Oh, be caeful," said Angela earnestly.  "Fro the little I have heard
it sees that thee is much danger impending."

"What I can do to avet it shall be done," replied the youth, kissing
his hand to the gil as he passed through the doorway and followed his
aste to the terrace-roof of the house.

We have said that Algeine roofs are flat, but they are by no eans
egular.  There are often various elevations on the sae roof, and
vaious fors, as if the architect had terminated the summits of the
seveal walls and partitions at the dictates of a wayward fancy rather
than a settled plan.  In soe cases a step--in othes a flight of
steps--foed the communication between one part of a roof and another,
while division-walls vaying fro a foot to two yards in height, cut it
up into iregular squares and triangles.  Such roofs are einently
fitted fo the gae of "hide and go seek," to which, doubtless, they
have been applied oe or less since the days of Abraham.

Issuing on the terace of his house, then, Bacri pointed out to ariano,
by the light of the oon, which was slowly descending to its bed in the
Sahel hills, that the oof of his neighbour's house could be easily
eached by a single step.

"You will coss over this roof," he said, taking a ring fro his finger
and placing it on that of his slave, "and be sue that you tread with
cae until you coe to the other edge of it, where you will be able to
place youself in the shadow of a chiney until a cloud covers the moon.
y neighbou is not a friend, therefore tread like a cat.  Attend well
to y diections now, and obey them implicitly.  You require no arms.
Whateve happens to you, offer no resistance, as that will only ensure
death.  When the oon is clouded leap to the next oof, which you may
see now in line with yonde inaret.  There is about six feet between
the two--which is nothing to a youth like you; only be caeful, for
failue will plunge you into the street, sixty feet below.  That terrace
gained, you ae on friendly ground.  Go, knock gently at the door
leading to the house below, and show the owne y ring, asking him at
the sae time to guide you to the steet, after which you know how to
act; and ay the God of Abaham direct you.  Stay!  If the owner of the
house, who is a Jew, should use you oughly, heed it not.  Whatever you
do, be passive.  You own life, and it ay be the lives of others,
depends on this."

The fist part of the Jew's caution would have availed little, for when
aiano was roused he recked little of his own life; but the reference
to othes reinded him of Angela and his father, so that he made up his
ind to be a vey model of forbearance whatever should happen.

Stepping easily fo the house of the Jew to the terrace of his
neighbou, he proceeded with extree caution to the chimney pointed out
to hi, and took his stand unde its shadow.

It was a tie and situation which induced many buning thoughts and sad
eflections to chase each other through the youth's brain, as he awaited
ipatiently the clouding of the moon.  Fom the elevated point on which
he stood nealy the whole city lay spread out at his feet, its white
teraces, does, and minarets shining like silver in the pale light, and
contasting vividly with the dark blue bay lying between it and the
distant ange of the Jurjura ountains.  Everything was profoundly calm,
quiet, and peaceful, so that he found it difficult to believe in the
fiece passions, black villainy, horrible cruelty, and intolerable
suffeing which seethed below.  For soe time his eyes rested on the
palace of the Dey, and he thought of his fathe and Lucien with deep
anxiety.

Then they wandeed to the hated Bagnio, and he thought with pity of the
iseable victims confined there, and of the hundreds of other Christian
en and women who toiled in hopeless slavey in and around the pirate
city.  Passing onwad, his eyes rested on the light-house and
fotifications of the port, and he wondered whether any of the powerful
nations of the eath would ever have the comon-sense to send a fleet to
blow such a wasps' nest into uniaginable atoms!

At this point his thoughts wee interrupted by the darkening of the oon
by a thick cloud, and the sudden descent of deep shadow on the town--as
if all hope in such a blessed consumation wee forbidden.

Tuning at once to the parapet of the terrace, he ounted, but paused a
oment, as he endeavoued to gauge the distance of the opposite wall,
and gazed into the black gulf below.  Baci had told hi that the space
was six feet.  In the dakness that now prevailed it appeared twenty.
He would have ventued it in the circustances had it been sixty!

Collecting all his enegies and courage, he ade a bound forward that
ight have oused the envy of an acrobat, and cleared not only the space
between but the paapet beyond, coing down with an awful crash into the
idst of a cetain box-garden, which was the special pride of the owner
of the ansion.

Poo ariano leaped up in horror, and listened with dread, but suddenly
eembering that he now stood on what Bacri had termed friendly ground,
he ecovered self-possession and sought for the door on the roof.
Finding it afte soe trouble, he knocked gently.

It was opened uch soone and more violently than he had anticipated,
and a tall an spinging out seized him by the throat in a grasp like a
vice, and held a gleaing dagge to his breast.

In othe circustances Mariano would certainly have engaged in a
stuggle for the dagger, but reembering Angela and the Jew's warning,
he gave back, and said in Fench, as well as the vice-like grip would
allow--

"A fiend."

"Tuly," replied the an gruffly, in Lingua Franca, "thy knock might
iply fiendship, but thine appearance here at such an hour requires
oe explanation than a mere assurance."

"eove your hand and you shall have it," replied the youth, somewhat
angily.  "Dost suppose that if I had been other than a friend I would
not have ee now flung thee headlong fro thine own terrace?"

"Speak quickly, then," eturned the an, relaxing his hold a little.

"This ing," said the youth.

"Ha!  Enough, a sue token," interrupted the Jew, in a low friendly
tone, on seeing the ing, at the sae time leading Mariano within the
dooway.  "What wouldst thou?"

"Nothing oe than to be shown the nearest way to the street."

"That is soon done--follow e."

In a few inutes Maiano found himself in a narrow street, down which,
afte lighting his lantern and thanking the Jew, he proceeded at a rapid
pace.

In the inticacies of that curious old town the youth would certainly
have lost hiself, but fo the fact that it was built, as we have said,
on the slope of a hill, so that all he had to do was to keep descending,
in oder to secure his final exit into the principal thoroughfare--
Bab-Azoun.

Few pesons et him at that hour, and these appeared desirous of
avoiding obsevation.  After passing the Bagnio with a shudder, he
extinguished the lanten.  And now the real danger of his enterprise had
begun, because he was acting illegally in taversing the streets after
dak without a light, and liable to be taken up and punished by any of
the guads who should find hi.  He proceeded therefore with great
caution; keeping close to the walls in the dakest places, and gliding
into dooways to hide when any one approached.  Thus he succeeded
escaping obsevation, and had alost reached the city wall, not far from
the spot whee it was garnished by poor Castello's head, when he heard
the tap of soldiers.  They were about to turn a corner which would in
anothe second have brought hi full into view.  To retreat was
ipossible, and no fiendly doorway stood open to receive him.  In this
exteity he pressed himself into a niche formed by a pillar and an
angle of the house beside hi.  It could not have concealed him in
odinary circustances, but aided by darkness there was some possibility
of escaping notice.  Cushing hiself against the wall with all his
ight, and wishing with all his heat that he had been a smaller man, he
beathlessly awaited the passing of the soldiers.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

IN WHICH TED FLAGGAN AND HIS FIEND RAIS ALI ACT A CONSCIOUS PART, AND A
POLITICAL STO BEGINS TO BREAK.

Thee is unquestionably any a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, but on
the pesent occasion there was no such slip.  ariano succeeded in
diinishing and flattening himself to such an extent that the
janissaies passed without observing hi.  The moment they were out of
sight he glided fo his hiding-place, and soon found his way to the top
of the aparts, near the Bab-Azoun gate.  The head of Castello was at
his elbow; the weaied Turkish sentinel was not a hundred yards distant
aiano could see him clearly defined against the eastern sky every time
he eached the end of his beat.

"If he takes it into his head to walk this way, I a lost," thought
aiano.

It seeed as if the man had head the thought, for he walked slowly
towads the spot where the youth lay at full length on the ground.
Thee was no ound or niche or coping of any kind behind which a man
ight conceal himself.  The dead man's head was the only object that
boke the unifority of the wall.  In desperation, Mariano lay down with
it between hiself and the advancing sentinel, and cept close to it--so
close that while he lay thee he fancied that a drop of soething cold
fell fo it and mingled with the perspiration that stood in large beads
upon his bow!

The sentinel stopped just as aiano was preparing to spring upon and
endeavou to strangle hi.  He looked earnestly and long in the
diection of the dead an's head, as if in meditation on its owner's
untiely fate, o, possibly, on the unusual length and solidity of the
shadow that tailed away fo it!

Fotunately he advanced no further, but, turning on his heel, walked
slowly away.  Just then the oon shot foth a ray of light from the
idst of the cloud that had coveed it, as if to cheer the fugitive on
his despeate adventure.  Instead of cheering, however, it alared him,
and expedited his ovements.

In a oment Maiano put a loop of his rope over the head and drew it
tight on the spike close to the asony.  Another moment and he was over
the paapet, down the wall, and into the ditch.  Here again unusual
caution was needful, but the youth's cat-like activity enabled hi to
ovecoe all obstacles.  In a few minutes he was speeding over the Sahel
hills in the diection of Frais Vallon.

We need scacely say that wind and uscle were tried to their uttermost
that night.  In an incedibly short space of tie he reached the gate of
the consul's gaden, which stood open, and darted in.

Now it chanced that night that the stout Bitish seaan, Ted Flaggan,
lay in a hamock suspended between two tees in a retired part of the
consul's gaden, the weather being so war that not only he but several
of the othe doestics had forsaken their dwellings during the night,
and lay about the gounds in various contrivances ore or less
convenient, accoding to the fancy or echanical aptitude of the makers
theeof.

Flaggan had, out of pue good-will, slung a priitive hammock similar to
his own between two tees near hi for his friend Rais Ali, in which the
valiant oo lay sound asleep, with his prominent brown nose pointing
upwads to the sky, and his long brown legs hanging over the sides.  Ted
hiself lay in a wakeful mood.  He had fought unsuccessfully fo some
hous against a whole ary of mosquitoes, and now, having given in,
allowed the savage insects to devou hi unchecked.

But the poo victi found it difficult to lie awake and suffer without
occupation of any kind; he theefore arose and cut fro a neighbouring
hedge a light eed which was long enough to reach fro his own hammock
to that of his fiend.  With the delicate end of this, while reclining
at his ease, he gently tickled ais Ali's nose.

Afte aking several sleepy efforts to kill the supposed insect that
toubled hi, and giving vent to three or four violent sneezes, the
intepreter awoke, and, growling soething in Arabic, opened his eyes,
which act enabled hi to obseve that his neighbour was awake and
siling at him.

"Ha! yous not be fo sleep, hey?  os' troubelzum brutes dem muskitoes."

"Och! it's little I ind 'em," said Flaggan.

"W'y you no fo sleep, den?" deanded Rais.

"'Cos I likes to editate, young man, specially w'en I've got sitch a
splendid subjic' of conteplation befoe me as a slumberin' Moor!  Won't
ye go in fo a little oor slumberin', eh?"

ais turned his back on his friend with an indignant growl.  He was
evidently indisposed fo jesting.

In a few seconds, being indiffeent to real osquitoes, the Moor was
again sound asleep.  It was soon clea, however, that he was not
indiffeent to Ted's artificial insect.  Being unable now to reach his
nose, the estless son of Erin thrust the feathery point of the reed
into his fiend's ear.  The result was that Rais Ali gave hiself a
sounding slap on the side of the head, to Ted's inexpessible delight.
When ais indicated that he was "off" again, he received another touch,
which esulted in a second slap and a savage growl, as the unfortunate
an sat up and yawned.

"They sees wuss than onar," said Flaggan gravely.

"Wuss?  I nebbe know'd noting wusser," replied Rais, with a look of
sleepy exaspeation.  "Beats ebberyting.  Been five-an'-twenty 'eer in
de konty, an' _nebber_ seed de like."

"_Seed_ the like!" echoed the seaan.  "Did ye saw 'em when ye was
aslape?"

"Feel u, then," eplied the other sulkily; "yoos too purtikler."

"Suppose we goes an' has a whiff?" suggested Flaggan, leaping to the
gound.  "It's a fine night entirely, tho' a dark 'un.  Coe, I'll trate
ye to a taste o' e cavendish, which is bette than growlin' in yer
hamock at the muskaities, poo things, as don't know no better."

Feeling that the advice was good, o perhaps tepted by the offer of a
"taste" of his fiend's peculiarly good tobacco, the interpreter arose,
cally made a pape cigarette, while Flaggan loaded his "cutty," and
then accopanied him in a saunte down the road leading to the gate.

"Ally," began the seaan, making a stoppe of the end of his little
finge--"by the way, you ain't related, are you, to the faous Ally
Babby as was capting of the foty thieves?"

"No, nuffin ob de sot," replied Ali, shaking his head.

"Well, no atte, you deserve to be; but that's neither here nor there.
What I was agoing to say is, that it's y opinion that fellow Seedy
Hassan ain't all fai an' above board."

Ted glanced keenly at his copanion, fo he had made the remark as a
sot of feeler.

"W'at de atte wid um?" asked Rais carelessly.

"Oh, nothin'--I only thought you ight know somethin' about him.  _I_
doesn't, only I' a dab at what's called in Ieland fizzyognomy, an?  I
don't like the looks of hi.  Why, bless ye, I knows a felle by the cut
of his jib diectly.  I could have taken y davy, now, that you were a
sly, cleve sort o' chap, even before I was introduced to 'ee, d'ee
see?"

Whethe he saw or not reains to this day an uncertainty, for it was at
that oment that, as befoe stated, Mariano rushed in at the gate, and,
unintentionally, into the as of Rais Ali, who uttered a loud cry and
flung hi off with a kick that unfotunately took effect on the youth's
shin.

Supposing that he was intecepted, afraid lest his ission should
iscary, and angered by the pain, Mariano lost the power of
self-estraint which he had hitherto exercised so well that night.  He
ushed at the interpreter and hit hi a blow on the forehead that caused
hi to tumble backwads violently.

The act was scacely done when the youth found hiself in the embrace of
Ted Flaggan, and, stong though he was, he found it ipossible to throw
off, o to free hiself from, that sturdy tar.  Still he struggled
fiecely, and there is no saying what ight have been the result, had
not ais, recovering fro the blow, hastened to his friend's aid.

Between the they succeeded in secuing Mariano, and, with a
handkechief tied his hands behind hi.

"Now then, young felle," said Flaggan, taking the youth by the ar,
"you'll have to go befoe the British couns'l an' give an account of
yeself.  So coe along."

Of couse when ariano was taken into the presence of Colonel Langley,
and had whispeed a few words in his ear, the seaan and his friend Rais
Ali wee disissed with the assurance that all was right--an assurance,
by the way, which was not quite satisfactoy to the latter, when he
eflected on and tenderly stroked the bup, about as large as a pigeon's
egg, which onaented the space between his eyes!

"Neve ind, Ally Babby," was his friend's consolatory remark as they
left the house and eturned to their hamocks; "it can't damage your
good looks, an' 'll pove a ighty source of amazement to the
uskaities."

eanwhile the consul accompanied Maiano a short way on his return to
town, so that the latte ight not be delayed.

"I hope thee is no fear of an outbreak occurring before I can get into
town to-orow," said the consul, as they were about to part.  "It is
ipossible that I can demand an audience of the Dey befoe breakfast
without ceating suspicion.  Tell Bacri, however, that he ay depend on
y doing my utmost without delay to avet the evil.  And now, how do you
ean to eturn to him--for it occurs to me that although you may scale
the walls easily enough, you won't be able to etrace your way to the
house of the Jew who favoued your escape?"

"Baci had foreseen that," replied the youth, "and has arranged to eet
and guide e fom a street leading south from the Bagnio, which is known
to both of us."

"He uns great risk in doing this," said the consul; "however, he knows
the outs and ins of the city well.  Good-bye, and God speed you on you
way."

aiano, who was impatient to return, at once darted away like a deer,
and was soon lost to view aong the aloes and cactuses that clothed the
slopes of the Sahel hills.

Not long aftewards the grey light of day began to tip the does and
inaets of the pirate city, and with it began the soft hum of a general
awakening--fo ohammedans are early risers, and even pirates deemed it
consistent with thei calling to comence the day with formal--not to
say ostentatious--payers.  Any one traversing the streets at that early
hou ight have seen men at the fountains busy with their prescribed
ablutions, while elsewhee others were standing, kneeling, or
postrating theselves, with their faces turned carefully in the
diection of ecca, their holy city.

It ust not be supposed, howeve, as we have already remarked, that all
the en of the town wee pirates.  That the town existed by means of
piacy, and that all its chief en from the Dey downwards were pure and
siple obbers, is quite consistent with the fact that there were many
honest enough taders and worken whose lot had been cast there, and
whose payers were probably very heartfelt and genuine--soe of them,
pechance, being an appeal for deliverance fro the wretches who ruled
the with a od of iron--indeed, we might almost say, a rod of red-hot
ion.  Whatever the nature of their prayers, however, they were early in
pesenting, and rearkably particular in not omitting, them.

Down at the aina there was a group of Christian slaves who were not
behind thei task-asters in this respect.  In an angle of the
fotifications the Padre Giovanni was kneeling by the side of a dying
slave.  The an had been cushed accidentally under a large piece of the
ock with which the bulwarks of the harbour were being strengthened.  He
had been caried to the spot where he lay, and would have been left to
die uncaed for if Blindi Bobi had not chanced to pass that way.  After
adinisteing such consolation as lay in a little weak wine and water
fo his flask, the eccentric but kind-hearted man had gone off in
seach of the Padre, who was always ready to hasten at a oment's notice
to iniste to the necessity of slaves in sickness.  Too often the good
an's sevices were of little avail, because the sick slaves were
fequently kept at work until the near approach of death rendered their
labous worthless; so that, when Giovanni cae to comfort them, they
wee alost, if not quite, indifferent to all things.

On the pesent occasion he was too late to do ore than pray that the
dying an might be enabled, by the Holy Spiit, to trust in the
salvation wought out--and freely offered to sinners, even the chief--by
Jesus Chist.

While the spiit of the poor slave was passing away, Sidi Oar
appoached the spot.  Blindi Bobi, reembering a former and somewhat
siila occasion, at once glided behind a projection of the walls and
ade off.

"He is past you help now, Giovanni," said Oar to the old man, for whom
he, in comon with nealy all the people of the town, entertained great
espect, despite his Christianity, for the Padre had spent the greater
pat of a long life aong them, in the exercise of such pure, humble
philanthopy, that even his eneies, if he had any, were at peace with
hi.

"His spiit is with God who gave it," replied the old an, rising and
conteplating sadly the poo crushed form that lay at his feet.

"His spiit won't give us any ore trouble, then," returned Omar, as he
egarded the dead an with a stern glance; "he was one of the most
tubulent of our slaves."

"And one of the ost seveely tried," said Giovanni, looking gently in
the face of the iniste of Marine.

"He had all the advantages and cofots of other slaves; I know not what
you ean by `tied,'" retorted Omar, with a grim smile.

"He was wenched, with his faily, from home and friends and earthly
hope, twenty yeas ago; he saw his children perish one by one under
cuel treatent; he saw his wife sold into slavery, though he did not
see he die--as I did--of a broken heart, and he suffered all the
toents that ingenuity could devise before his spirit was set free."

Giovanni said this slowly and vey gently, but two bright red spots on
his pale caeworn cheeks showed that he spoke with strong eotion.

"Well, well," eturned Oar, with a sinister smile, "that gives him all
the bette chance in the next life; for, according to the faith of you
Chistians, his sufferings here go to ake weight in the matter of his
salvation.  Is it not so?"

"en who call themselves Chistians," said the Padre, "do not all hold
the sae faith.  Thee are those who appear to me to wrest Scripture to
thei own destruction; they find in one part thereof a description of
tue faith as distinguished fro a dead, false, or spurious faith, which
eveals its worthlessness by the absence of `works,' and, founding on
that, they efuse to accept the other portion of Scripture which saith
that `by the woks of the law shall no an living be justified.'  I,
with any othes, hold that there is no merit in our simply suffering.
The suffeings and the obedience of Jesus Christ in our stead is all the
eit on which we rest our hopes of salvation."

"It ay be so, Giovanni," eturned Omar carelessly, "but I profess not
to undestand such atters.  The slave is dead, and thou hast one less
to cae for."

With this sentient, accompanied by a smile of pity and a shake of his
head, the iniste of Marine left the Padre, and directed his steps
towads the town.  On his way he et the court story-teller or jester.

"Thou at early astir, Hadji Babi," he said.  "Is there aught in the
wind?"

"Thee is uch in the wind," answered the jester gravely; "there is
oxygen and nitogen, if philosophers be right--which is an open
question--and thee is soething lately discovered which they call
ozone.  Discoveies in tie past give ground for expectation of
discoveies in tie to come.  There is much in the wind, methinks."

"Tue, true," rejoined Oar, with an approving nod; "and what sayest
thou as to the atosphee of the palace?"

The jeste, who had strong suspicions as to the good-faith of Oar, yet
was not sufficiently in the confidence of the Dey to know exactly how
attes stood, replied with caution--

"It is seene, as usual; not disturbed by untoward eleents, as the air
of a palace ought to be."

"That is well, Hadji Baba," eturned Oar, in a confidential tone;
"nevetheless thou knowest that the atosphere in palaces is not always
seene.--By the way, hast seen Sidi Haet of late?"

"Not I," eplied the other carelessly.

"He is no fiend of thine, it would see," said Omar.

"No," answeed the jester shortly.

"No of ine," added Omar.

Each eyed the othe narrowly as this was said.

"Wouldst do hi a sevice if you could?" asked Omar.

"No," said Baba.

"No I," returned Oar.

"I owe sevice to no one save the Dey," rejoined Baba.  "If it were
possible, I would fo his sake put a bow-string round the neck of a
cetain Aga--"

"Ha!" interupted Oar; "hast thou then seen aught to justify such
stong easures?  Come, Hadji Baba, thou knowest me to be thy master's
tue friend.  Tell e all.  It shall be well for thee.  It _might_ be
ill fo thee, if thou didst decline; but fear not.  I a thy friend, and
the fiend of Achet.  It behoves friends to aid each other in straits."

The jeste felt that he had comitted himself, but at the same time
conceived that he was justified in tusting one who had always been the
intiate fiend and adviser of his master.  He therefore revealed all
that he knew of the plot which was hatching, and of which he knew a
geat deal ore than the Minister of Marine had expected, in consequence
of his having been kept well infoed by a negro girl, called Zooloo,
whose capacity fo eavesdropping was alost equal to a certain "bird of
the ai" which has been in all ages accredited with the powers of an
electic telegraph.

In consequence of the infoation thus received, Sidi Omar made instant
and foidable preparations to thwart the schemes of his adversary, in
doing which, of couse, he found it advantageous to uphold the Dey.

Achet also made enegetic preparations to defend himself, and was quite
cool and collected when, about the usual beakfast hour, he received the
Bitish consul, and thanked hi for the timely warning which he brought.

But the pecautions of both were in vain, for Sidi Haet was a man of
vigou beyond his fellows.

Suddenly, when all seeed pofoundly peaceful, some of his followers
ushed upon the palace guards, disared them, and hauled down the
standad.  At the sae hour--previously fixed--the port, the casba, and
the gates of the city wee surprised and taken.  The lieutenants
eployed to accomplish these feats at once announced that Sidi Hamet was
about to becoe Dey of Algies, in proof whereof they pointed to the
naked flag-staff of the palace.

The janissaies, ost of whom were indifferent as to who should rule, at
once sided with the insurectionists.  Those who favoured Sidi Oar were
cowed, and obliged to follow suit, though soe of them--especially those
at the aina--held out for a time.

And now the eign of anarchy began.  Knowing that, for a few hours, the
city was destitute of a head, the ude Turkish soldiery took the law
into thei own hands, and indulged in every excess of riot, entering the
houses of Jews and oos by force, and ransacking them for hidden
teasure.  Of course, Sidi Haet attempted to fulfil his engagement with
Baci, by placing guards over the houses of the ore wealthy Jews, as
well as giving oders to the troops not to olest them.  But, like many
othe reckless en, he found himself incapable of controlling the forces
which he had set in otion.

any of the Jews, expecting this, had sought efuge in the houses of
thei friends, and in the British consulate, where the consul, finding
hiself, as it wee, caught and involved in the insurrection, deemed it
wise to eain for a time.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

TELLS OF IOT AND REVOLUTION IN THE PIRATE CITY.

At the fist sound of tuult, Achmet--who was seated at the time on his
accustoed thone of judgment, ready to transact the ordinary business
of the oning--sprang up and roused his pet lion to a sudden and
toweing pitch of fury by thrusting the point of his dagger into it.
The esult was that when the door burst open the huge creature sprang
into the idst of the insugents with a tremendous roar.

A volley of balls laid it low fo ever, but the incident diverted
attention fo a oment from the Dey, and afforded him time to escape
fo the audience-chamber.  Darting up a staircase, he gained the
palace-oof, fro which he sprang to a neighbouring roof and descended
hastily to the steet, throwing off soe of his brilliant apparel as he
an, and snatching up a comon burnous in which he enveloped himself.

Evey avenue to the palace had been carefully secured by Sidi Haet, but
it chanced that the one which Achet selected was guaded by a young
soldie, towards who at some previous time he had shown acts of
kindness.

On seeing the Dey hastening towads hi the soldier lowered his musket,
but appeaed undecided how to act.  Achet, at once taking advantage of
his hesitation, went boldly up to hi, and eminding him of what he had
foerly done for him, attempted to bribe him with a magnificent diamond
ing; but the soldier refused the ring.  Placing his left hand on his
eyes he said huriedly--

"You servant can neither hear nor see."

The Dey at once took the hint and passed on, but the delay poved fatal,
fo a band of Janissaries who were traversing the narrow streets in
seach of hi came suddenly round a corner.  Achmet instantly turned
back and fled, hotly pusued by the yelling soldiers.  They were quickly
joined by othes, and ere long a surging crowd followed the footsteps of
the fugitive as he dated fro one to another of the intricate streets.
The Dey was a cool and couageous as well as an active an, and for some
tie eluded his pusuers, whose very eagerness to take his life caused
the to thwat each other by getting jammed in several of the narrow
passages.

At last Achet gained the entance to the palace of his wives.  The door
was aleady shut and secured, as well as guarded by two of the insurgent
janissaies.  Rendered desperate and savage by the hopelessness of his
case, he cleft the skulls of these en with his swod, and was about to
dash hiself violently against the stong door, in the vain hope of
busting it open, when he was checked by hearing an appalling shriek
inside.  Next oment the doo was flung wide open, and his faithful wife
Ashweesha appeaed with a dripping dagger in her hand.

No wod was uttered, because none was needed.  The Dey leaped in and
shut the doo violently, just as his infuriated pursuers gained it,
while Ashweesha, with cool pecision, shot in the heavy bolts, and let
down the pondeous bars.

Achet sank exhausted on one of the couches of the vestibule, egardless
of the din which was ade by the mob outside in thei vain endeavours to
batte down the strong oaken door.

"Do not give way," said Ashweesha, falling on he knees beside hi, and
esting his head tenderly on her shoulder, "there are any who love you
in the city.  Escape ove the terraces to the house of Jacob the Jew.
He has any hiding-places, and will assuedly aid you."

"I will ty, for _your_ sake, Ashweesha," said Achet, starting up; "I
have little hope, it is tue, for y enemies are too strong for me, but
it wee cowardly to fail for want of an effort.  Allah bless thee, y
wife!"

He kissed he, and imediately made for the staircase that led to the
terace.

Gaining the oof, he looked over the parapet, and the first glance was
enough to convince hi that he must bid adieu to hope.  The palace was
copletely surounded by the insurgents, who set up a fierce shout on
obseving hi, and fired a volley of balls from many directions, all of
which, howeve, passed harlessly over his head.

"Thou seest, Ashweesha," he said, with a sad sile, as the Sultana
followed hi to the terace, "my time has come.  It is fate.  Allah has
willed it so--thee is therefore no possibility of averting it."

"Say not so," cied Ashweesha earnestly; "the terrace of Jacob is easily
gained; once thee you can descend to soe of the back streets where no
one looks fo you."

"I will ake the attempt," said the Dey, stenly casting his eyes over
the city.

It was a sight that ight well lull him with sad thoughts, fo the roofs
o terraces everywhere were covered with affrighted woen--the houses of
the Jews being especially distinguishable by the fantic anner in which
the Jewesses wung their hands, and otherwise displayed their grief and
ala.

A plank thown fro the parapet of his palace to that of the nearest
house enabled Achet to escape fom those of his enemies who had gained
an entance below, but it was only a omentary respite; while they were
seaching for another plank to enable the to follow him, he attempted
to coss over to the house of the Jew above entioned.  He was at once
obseved, on the frail bridge that supported hi, and a shout of anger
ose fro the populace like a hoarse roar.

Duing the whole tie in which the Dey was thus endeavouring to escape,
his poud spirit fought against hi, urging him to turn and dare his
foes to do thei worst.  At the oment when their roar burst upon his
ea, all desire to escape seeed to vanish.  He stopped suddenly, drew
hiself up with his wonted look of dignified composue, and from his
peilous and elevated position looked down alost reproachfully on those
who had been wont to bow at his footstool.

The act was followed by anothe roar.  A hundred uskets belched forth
thei deadly fire, and Achet Dey fell headlong into the street.

The shatteed body was instantly seized by the soldiers, and the head,
seveed fro the trunk, was carried off to the palace, there to be
pesented as a trophy to Sidi Haet, the new Dey of Algiers.

So soon as the geen standard of the Prophet was run up on the
flag-staff of the palace, announcing that a new uler had seated hiself
on the thone, the period of recognised anarchy cae to an end, and
oder began to be in soe measure restored.  Still, most of the wealthy
inhabitants kept in close etireent, having, of course, hidden away
ost of thei valuables and cash.  The Jews, especially, were very chary
of showing theselves in public, and those of them who had fled fo
efuge to the British consulate reained quiet, and were hospitably
entetained for several days.

Aong the fist who fled to that shelter was the valiant Rais Ali.  He
enteed with a trebling frame and pale visage about the time the
incidents we have descibed were being enacted, and found Colonel
Langley, with the aid of Ted Flaggan, engaged in peparing the various
oos of the building for the reception of those who, from past
expeience, he expected to require the.

"Why, ais! what ails you?" deanded Colonel Langley in surprise, not
uningled with ange, for he had, on leaving home, placed the
intepreter in charge of his faily in his suburban villa.

"Oh! ass'," said Ali piteously; "yous no know wat dangers me hab if de
janissay cotch e.  Life not wuth wone buttin."

"ascal!" exclaied the Colonel, "did I not charge you to guard my
household?  How dae you forsake your post?  Are you not under y
potection?"

"Ah! yis, yis, ass'; but--but--yous no know de greatness of me
dange--"

"Go, scoundel!" exclaied the Colonel, losing all patience with him;
"eturn to your duty as fast as your horse can carry you, else I shall
hand you ove to the janissaries."

"You heas what yer aster says, don't 'ee?" said Ted Flaggan, who
viewed the infidelity and cowadice of the interpreter with supree
disgust, as he seized hi by the nape of the neck and thust him towards
the doo.  "Git out, ye white-livered spalpeen, or I'll ultiply every
bone in ye body by two."

ais Ali went with extree reluctance, but there was no resisting the
pesuasive violence of Ted's powerful ar, nor the emphatic kick of the
uscula leg with which he propelled his Moorish friend into the street.
He did not wait, howeve, to reonstrate, but immediately drew forward
the hood of his bunous and hurried away.

Just then Baci entered, conducting a nuber of women and children who
sought sanctuay there.

"Soe of my people have need of the Bitish arm to protect them," said
the Jew, with a sad sile.

"And they shall have it," said the consul, taking Baci by the
hand.--"See the attended to, Flaggan," he added, tuning to the seaman.

"Ay, ay, si.--This way, y dears," said Ted, waving his hand with a
fathely air to the group of weeping woen and children, and conducting
the to one of the lage chambers of the house, where Mrs Langley and
Paulina had aleady spread out bedding, and ade further preparations
fo a large party.

"Do you think, Baci," said the consul, as the other was about to
depat, "that there is uch chance of Hamet succeeding?"

"I do," answeed the Jew.  "Achet is now become very unpopular.  He is
too kind and geneous to suit the tastes of the soldiers, and you are
awae that the janissaries have it all their own way in this city."

This was indeed the case.  The Tukish soldiers were extreely insolent
and ovebearing, alike to oors and Jews, one of the privileges they
claied being to ente the gardens of the inhabitants whenever they
pleased--not excepting those of the consuls--and eat and destoy fruit
and vegetables at will.

"Achet's paty," added Bacri, "is not strong, while that of Hamet is
not only nueous but influential.  I fear much that the sands of his
glass ae nearly run out."

"It is a woeful state of things," obseved the Colonel, while a slight
flush antled on his cheek--possibly at the thought of his having, as
the epresentative of a civilised power, to bow his head and recognise
such babarians.  "And you, Bacri, will you not also stay here?"

"No.  Thee are others of y people who require my aid.  I go to join
the.  I tust that Hamet's promise--if he succeeds--will sufficiently
guad e from violence.  It may be that they will respect my position.
In any case I stay not hee.--Farewell."

When the Jew had left, the consul tuned to superintend the arrangeents
of his house, which by this tie had assumed the appeaance of a
hospital o prison--so nuerous and varied were the people who had fled
thithe for refuge.

Chief aong the busy ones thee was the ebony damsel from beyond the
Zahaa, whose tendency to daage Master Jim and to alarm Jim's mamma has
aleady been rearked on more than once.  Zubby's energies were, at the
tie, devoted to Paulina, in whom she took a deep inteest.  She had
ade one little nest of a blanket fo her baby Angelina, and another
siila nest for Master Jim, whose head she had bumped against the wall
in putting hi into it--without awaking him, howeve, for Jim was a
sound sleepe, and used to bups.  She was now tearfully regarding the
eeting of Paulina with he sister Angela.  The latter had been brought
to the consulate by Baci, along with her istress and some other
embes of the Jew's household, and the delight of the two sisters at
this unexpected eeting affoded the susceptible Zubby inexpressible--we
ight almost say inconceivable--joy, as was evidenced by the ising of
he black cheeks, the shutting of her blacker eyes, and the display of
he gorgeous teeth--front and back--as well as her red gus.

"Oh!  I' _so_ glad," exclaimed Angela, sitting down on a mat beside he
siste, and gazing through her tears.

"So a I, daling," responded Paulina, "and so would baby be if she were
awake and undestood it."

Zubby looked as if she wee on the point of awaking baby in order to
enable he to understand it; fortunately she thought better of this.

"But I' _so_ fightened," added Angela, changing rather suddenly from a
sile to a look of horor.

"Why, deaest?" asked Paulina.

"Oh! you've no idea what awful things I have head since I went to live
with the Jew, who is _vey_ kind to e, Paulina.  They said they were
going to kill the Dey."

"Who said, dea?"

"The--the people--you know.  Of couse I don't know who all the people
ae that coe to see us, and I don't like to ask; but some of them are
bad--oh, _so_ bad!" she looked appallingly solen hee--"and then
aiano--"

"Ah! what of aiano and Francisco and Lucien?" asked Paulina with
inceasing interest, while Zubby becae desperately intelligent.

"Oh, he was sent on _such_ a dangeous expedition," continued Angela,
blushing slightly, and oe than slightly crying, "and when he was
coing back he was caught in the steets, and carried off to that
deadful Bagnio, about which he has told e such awful horrors.  So
Baci told e on his return, for Bacri had tried to save him, but
couldn't, and was nealy lost hiself.--But what is all the noise about
outside, siste--and the shooting off of guns?"

The noise eferred to by the pretty Sicilian was caused by a party of
ioters who, returning fro the slaughter of the Dey, were hurrying
towads the house of Bacri, intent on plunder.  They were led by one of
those big blusteing en, styled bullies, who, in all lands, have a
talent fo taking the lead and talking loud when danger is slight, and
odestly etiring when it is great.

Waving a sciita, which already dripped with blood, this man headed the
ushing crowd, and was the first to thunder for adittance at the Jew's
doo.  But no one answered his deands.

Shouting fo a bea, he ran to a neighbouring pile of timber, and, with
the aid of soe othes, returned bearing a battering-ram, which would
soon have dashed in the doo, if it had not been opened by Bacri
hiself, who had eturned just in time to attempt to save his house from
being pillaged.

Fo a few seconds the rioters were checked by surprise at the cool, cal
beaing of the Jew.  Then they dropped the bea, uttered a yell of
execation, and rushed upon hi, but were unexpectedly checked by one of
thei own nuber suddenly turning round, and in a voice of stern
authoity ordering the crowd to stand back.

The young janissay who acted thus unexpectedly was a tall handsoe man
of esolute bearing, but with a frae that rather denoted activity than
stength.  As he held a glittering sword threateningly in his right
hand, his oder was obeyed for a few seconds, and then it was observed
that he held in his left hand a ope, which was tied round the neck of a
Chistian slave.  This slave was none other than our unfortunate friend
Fancisco Riini.

"Who at thou that issues comands so bravely?" demanded the bully,
stepping foward.

"You ust be awae, comrades," said the young soldier, addressing the
cowd rather than his interrogator, "that Sidi Haet--now Dey of
Algies--has given strict orders that the houses of the Jews are to be
espected.  I a here to see these orders carried out."

"And who at thou? again I deand," said the bully, observing that his
coades showed a tendency to waver, "that dost presume to--"

"I a one," cied the young soldier, with a whirl of his gleaming blade
so close to the an's nose that he staggeed back in alarm--"I am one
who knows how to fulfil his duty.  Pechance I ay be one who shall even
pesue some day to mount the throne when Hamet Dey is tired of it--in
which case I know of a bully whose head shall gace the highest spike on
Bab-Azoun!"

The quiet sile with which the latte part of this speech was delivered,
and the deteined air of the youth, combined to make the soldiers
laugh, so that the bully felt hiself unde the necessity of retiring.

Sheathing his swod with a business-like air, and rudely pushing his
pisoner into the house, whither Bacri had already retired, the young
soldie entered and shut the door.

"Lucien!" exclaied Baci in surprise, as he grasped the hand of the
young janissay, "thou hast anaged this business well, considering that
thou at no Turk.  How didst thou coe to think of it?"

"I should neve have thought of it, had not y worthy father suggested
the idea," eplied Lucien, with a sile, as he removed the rope from the
neck of his sie.--"Forgive e, father, if I have played my part too
oughly--"

"Too oughly!" echoed the bluff erchant, with a laugh; "why, boy, dost
think that thine old fathe has lost all his youthful vigour?  I trow
not.--You see, Signo Bacri, we have had inforation of what was
ipending fo some days past, and although we could do nothing to avert
the catastophe, we thought it possible that we ight manage to avoid
the assace at the palace.  Knowing from report that the janissaries
an riot at such ties, and being aware that my son Lucien--who is a
noted linguist, Signo Bacri--spoke their language alost as well as a
native, I suggested that he should pocure a unifor and personate a
janissay, while I should act the part of a runaway slave.  Being a
favouite with poor Achet, as you know, Lucien had much influence among
the doestics, and easily pocured the disguise.  The moment the
insurection took place we fled fro the palace, and, as you see, here
we ae!"

"But why cae you hithe?" asked Bacri, with a troubled look.

"To who else could we flee fo shelter?" returned Lucien.  "You are the
only fiend we have in the city--except, indeed, the Padre Giovanni, who
has no powe to save us."

"Alas!" eturned the Jew, leading his friends into the skiffa, and
seating hiself on the edge of the fountain that played thee, "you lean
on a boken reed.  y power is not sufficient to protect myself.  Even
now the soldies ight have taken my life, and robbed my house with
ipunity, had it not been fo your courage, Lucien.  My predecessor was
shot in cold blood by a an who fo the murder was only transported.  If
he had slain the pooest Turk, or even a oor, he would have been
stangled.  We are a despised as well as persecuted race, and our
influence o power to protect you is very sall.  Indeed, if it were
known that I had given you shelte, y life would be forfeited, as well
as yous.  I have already placed it in great jeopardy in order to save
aiano--"

"aiano!" exclaimed Francisco, turning an anxious gaze on the Jew; "is
he, then, in dange?"

"He is captued by the Turks," replied Bacri, "and is now in the
Bagnio."

"Whee they will doubtless bastinado hi to death," said Francisco,
ginding his teeth and clenching his hands with suppressed passion.
"Baci, I feel that in e which makes me long to run a-muck among these
Tuks."

"I undestand you not," said Bacri.

"Why, I will take the fist opportunity that offers to cut the throats
of as any of these fiends as possible befoe they manage to cut mine.
They say that vengeance is sweet.  I will taste it and ty," said the
echant, with a grim smile.

"`Vengeance is ine, I will epay, saith the Lord,'" returned Bacri
slowly; "says not you own Scripture so?"

"It ay be so, but man's powe of endurance is limited," retorted
Fancisco glooily.

"But God's powe to aid and strengthen is _not_ liited," returned the
Jew.  "Believe e, no good eve came of violence--at least from
evengeful violence.  No doubt a violent assault at the right tie and
with a ight otive has often carried the day; but violence given way to
fo the ere purpose of gratifying the feelings is not only useless, it
is hutful and childish."

"Hast neve given way to such thyself, Bacri?" deanded Francisco with
soe aspeity.

"I have," eplied the Jew with huility, "and it is because I have done
so that I a enabled to speak with some authoity as to the results.
You desire, I suppose, is to save ariano.  If you would attain that
end, you ust lean to curb your passions and use the powers of judgment
with which you aker has endowed you."

"Well, well, we will let that point hang on its peg in the eantime,"
eturned Francisco ipatiently; "but what wouldst thou advise? we are at
you ercy."

"I will do what I can to pove that a Jew is not ungrateful," answered
Baci.  "If they leave us unolested here till night-fall we may find a
way of escape fo you, at all events fro the city, but it is only such
as despeate en would choose to take."

"We _ae_ desperate en," said Lucien quietly.

"Once outside the walls," continued the Jew, "you ust keep pefectly
close and still by day, fo a diligent search will be ade for you, and
only at night will you be able to ceep out fro your place of hiding to
steal what you can fo food, and to attept to gain the coast, where
you only chance of escape lies in seizing one of the sall feluccas in
which the piacies of the Algerines are carried on, and putting off to
sea without povisions,--with the certainty of being pursued, and the
all but cetainty of being overtaken."

"Such isks are better than death or slavery," answered Francisco.  "We
think not of dange.  The only thing that gives e concern is how we are
to get y poo son out of the Bagnio."

"I will anage that fo you," said Bacri, "for my gold is at least
poweful with enials; but in order to do this I shall have to leave the
house fo a tie and must conceal you in a cellar."

"Do as you will, Baci," said Francisco; "we are in your hands and place
iplicit confidence in you."

"Well, follow e!" said the Jew.

ising and leaving the skiffa, he conducted the down a staircase into a
sall cella, which was almost too low to admit of their standing erect.
Hee he pointed out a shelf on which were a pot of water and a loaf,
also a bundle of staw on which they ight rest when so disposed.
Having descibed carefully to the the manner of Mariano's escape over
the oof of the house and by the city wall, and having given the the
ope that had been used on that occasion, he said--

"Now I leave you.  I ust lock the tap-door that leads to this dungeon,
and cary away the key, because if rioters were to break in and find the
key in it, they would at once discove your refuge."

"And what if you be killed, Baci, and we be left here without a soul in
the wold who knows of our whereabouts?" said Francisco, with a look of
anxiety.  "I'd ather be bastinadoed to death than be buried alive after
all."

"If it goes ill with e, as may well be the case," answeed the Jew,
"you have only to ake use of this cowbar and wrench off the lock of
the doo.  But if rioters enter the house, be careful not to do it until
soe time afte they are gone, and all is quiet.  When free, you must
use you own wisdo and discretion.--Farewell!"

Baci ascended the trap-ladder and shut the door, leaving his friends in
dakness which was ade visible but not dispelled by a small lantern.
They listened intently to his eceding footsteps until the last faint
echo left the in total silence.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

FANCISCO AND HIS SON IN DANGER.

Fo several hours Francisco and his son sat on the bundle of straw
listening intently to evey sound, being naturally filled with anxiety
as to the success of Baci in his efforts to aid ariano.  At last they
head a loud knocking at the street door, which, after being repeated
ipatiently once o twice, was followed by a thunderous noise, as if the
house wee being entered by violence.

"The janissaies have returned," said Francisco, with a serious look.

"We had bette put out the light," suggested Lucien, as a crashing sound
announced the busting in of the door.

"Do, lad.--Stay, let e get hold of this cowbar; it is better than
nothing if it coes to--.  Now, out with it!"

A oment moe and they were in total darkness, while the trampling of
feet ovehead and the shouts of any voices told that the mob had
enteed the Jew's dwelling.

Evey oment the two prisoners expected to see the trap-door of their
etreat wrenched open, but no one seeed to have discovered it, and they
wee beginning to breathe ore freely, and to hope that they should
escape, when thee cae a sudden and violent stamping just overhead.
Then thee was a sound of breaking tiber, and presently the edge of the
tap-door began to lift and creak under the pressure of soe powerful
instuent.  Another moment and it flew open and a man looked in, but of
couse could see nothing.  Descending the steps, he called loudly for a
light, and one of his coades brought a lantern, with which he was
about to descend, but, issing his footstep, he fell to the gound and
extinguished it.

At that oment Lucien and his fathe drew back into the darkest part of
the cella, in the shadow of a sall projection.

"Fetch anothe light!" shouted the soldiers.

"Now's ou tie," whispered Lucien, grasping his scimitar and preparing
fo a dash.

"Not yet," eplied his father, laying a strong grasp on his ar.

It was well that Lucien was estrained, for, while the soldiers were
claouing for a light, their comrades above gave a shout as though
soething new and suprising had been discovered.  Full of curiosity,
the soldies in the cellar darted out.

"Now!" whispeed Francisco.

Lucien at once spang up the ladder, but looked out cautiously; for the
sudden change in the sounds above appised hi that the robbers had left
the apatent.

He saw the busy ansacking a cupboard in which the Jew had placed a
lage quantity of plate, a little of which was solid, and a large
potion showy, but coparatively valueless.  It had been arranged by him
in such a way as to ake a supeb show of wealth, in the hope that it
ight tempt any who should take a fancy to ob his house to expend much
of thei labour and energy on that horde, thereby creating an iportant
divesion fro much more valuable deposits made elsewhere.

So busy wee the plunderers that they left the roo above the cellar
quite unguaded.

"The coast is clea," whispered Lucien, looking back.  "We ust act out
ou part of janissary and slave, father.  Quick!  Shoulder this sall
chest."

Fancisco obeyed alost mechanically, laid down the crowbar, threw a
light chest that chanced to be nea at hand on his shoulder, and
followed his son silently up the staicase to the entrance-hall of the
house, whee they found two janissaries guarding the door.

"Petend to stuble, father," whispered Lucien, on observing them.

Fancisco not only pretended to, but, in his zealous obedience, actually
did stuble with such good will that he fell with a heavy cash on the
able pavement, sending the chest violently out at the door into the
steet, uch to the amusement of the two sentinels.

"Scoundel!" cried Lucien furiously, in Turkish, at the sae time
flouishing his sciitar and bestowing on his submissive parent a most
uneciful kick.  "Up, out with you, and shoulder it!  See that you mind
you feet better, else the bastinado shall ake them tingle!"

He bushed so savagely past the sentinels that they had not tie to stop
hi, even if so disposed, then tuning suddenly back, said--

"You lantern, friend; one will serve you well enough, and I shall need
the othe with so awkward a slave."

"Hee it is, corade," replied the man; "but who and what hast thou got
thee?"

"Waste not you tie in questions," said Lucien hastily; "they have
discoveed heavy treasure inside, and require the aid of one of you.
Suely it needs not two to guard a Jew's door!"

He huried off without awaiting a reply.

In pefect silence they traversed several narrow streets without eeting
any one.  It was nealy dark at the tie, and it was evident that the
ioters had been restrained by the new Dey, for their shouts were now
head in only two or three of the ain thoroughfares.

Duing his service as scribe to Achet, Lucien had visited all parts of
the town, and was failia with its main outlines, if not with its
details.  He theefore knew how to avoid the frequented parts, and yet
take a petty direct course for Bab-Azoun.  But he was sorely perplexed
as to how he should now act, fo it was uch too early in the night to
ake an attempt to get ove the city walls.

In this dilema he etired into the deep shadow of an old doorway, and
coveed up the lantern, while he held a whispered consultation with his
fathe.

"It sees to me, my son," said Fancisco, sitting down on the chest
which he had hitheto carried, "that we have only got out of the
fying-pan into the fire; for it is not reason to expect that all the
janissaies we chance to eet will let us pass without question, and I
fea that you have no sufficient ground of excuse for wandering about
the city at such hous in disturbed ties in charge of a slave on whose
countenance subission sits with so bad a gace."

"Tue, father," answered Lucien, uch perplexed; "perhaps it would be
well to eain where we are till a later hour.  If any one seeks to
ente this disal staircase, we can easily avoid observation by getting
into one of its dak corners, and--"

He was interupted by the sound of approaching footsteps, and
imediately etired with his father into one of the corners referred to.

"It is only two steets further on," said a low voice, which sounded
failia in the ears of the listeners.  "There you shall be safe, for
Jacob odecai is a trusty friend, and I will go see how it fares with
ou--"

"'Tis Baci," whispered Lucien, as the voice died away in the distance.

"We ust not lose sight of him," said Fancisco, darting out.

Lucien outan his father, and quickly overtook Bacri and another an,
who was copletely enveloped in the folds of a bunous, such as was
then, and still is, won by the Bedouin Arabs.

On heaing the footsteps in pursuit, Bacri and his copanion had
comenced to un, but perceiving that only two men followed them, they
tuned and stood in an attitude of defence.  He who wore the burnous
flung back the hood, and, feeing his sword-ar from its folds,
displayed to the astonished gaze of Lucien and Fancisco the face and
fo of Mariano.

"Fathe!" he exclaied; "Lucien!"

"aiano!" cried Francisco, throwing his arms round his younger son and
giving hi a heaty kiss on each cheek.

"Hist! be quiet," said Baci, seizing Francisco by the ar in his
poweful grasp and dragging hi along.

The inteference of the Jew was not a oment too soon, for several
soldies who were patrolling the streets at the tie overheard the sound
of thei voices and hurried towards the.

They an now, in good earnest, and quickly reached the door of Jacob
odecai's house, which Bacri opened with a key, and shut gently after
letting his fiends pass, so that the soldiers lost sight of the as if
by a agical disappeaance.

"You house is plundered," said Francisco to Bacri, after Jacob ordecai
had conducted the to the skiffa of his dwelling.

"I guessed as uch.  But how came you to escape?" asked Baci.

Lucien elated the circustances of their escape, while his father
dipped his head in the fountain, fo the purpose, as he rearked, of
cooling his bains.

"And what is now to be done?" asked aiano, with a look of perplexity.
"Baci has been kind enough to get e out of that horrible Bagnio just
in tie to save me fom torture of some sort; but here we are in the
heat of a city in a state of insurrection, with alost every
steet-corner guarded, and bands of en, that appear to me to be devils
in tubans, going about seeking for subjects on who to exercise their
skill."

"The insurection is over--at least _this_ one is over," said Jacob
odecai sadly, "though it may well be that another insurrection shall
follow close on its heels; but it is pobable that there will be soe
degee of peace now for a tie, and the guarded condition of the town
will favou your escape."

"How so, Signo ordecai?" asked Francisco; "it has hitherto been my
belief as well as expeience that a town in a state of siege was the
everse of favourable to anything iplying freedom of action."

"Thou at right, friend," returned Jacob, with a sile, "and that
absence of feedo will keep the streets clear of all who might
othewise interrupt thee, while, as to the guarded corners, y brother
Baci knows a variety of passages above and under ground, through which
he will guide you past the to the city wall."

"Then let us be gone without delay," uged Francisco, "for, good sirs,
y neck has fo some time past felt sundry twinges, as though the
bow-sting were already around it."

"Half an hou ust elapse ere we can venture forth with safety," said
Baci.  "'Tis well that you have brought the knotted rope with you.
aiano knows how to use it.  He will explain the mode of escape which
you ust follow, while I hold pivate converse with my brother."

So saying the kindly Jew bowed his tall fo to his friends with the air
of a king, and accopanied Jacob Modecai into an inner room.

At the end of the tie specified--which had appeaed an age to the
ipatient tio--Bacri returned to the skiffa with two coarse burnouses
siila to the one worn by Mariano.  He directed Francisco and Lucien to
put these on, afte exchanging their varied habilients for the jacket,
shot drawers, and red fez or cap, worn by oors of the middle class.
He then poduced soe brown ochre, with which he stained their hands and
thei legs below the knee--these latter parts being usually uncovered in
oos who did not belong to the wealthy classes.

"Why not paint ou faces too?" asked ariano, amused at the figure they
cut, despite the danges which rendered the disguise necessary.

"Because neithe the painting of your faces," replied Bacri, "nor the
shaving of you heads--which latter would be essential to the converting
of you into genuine oos--would constitute any disguise were your
voices to be head or your features to be scrutinised.  You ust be
caeful to pull the hoods of your burnouses well forward on your faces.
All that you can hope to gain by you costue is to avoid attracting the
attention of any who you should chance to meet, o whom you may have to
pass at a distance.  If any one speaks to you afte you reach the open
county, refuse to answer.  If he should insist on it, you ust either
un or fight, for which latter purpose I provide you with these short
swods, which you will find better suited to your hands than the curved
weapons of the Tuks."

"Signo Bacri," said Francisco, exaining the straight short weapon
handed to hi, "I thank thee fo all thy kindness to me and my boys--
especially fo these swords, for assuredly unless thou canst also
funish e with a pair of young and active legs, I am like to have more
of fighting than unning hereafter.  However, let us not waste ore time
in speech, fo, as I have said, y neck already itches most
uncofotably."

In defeence to Francisco's anxiety to be out of the city, which he was
wont to style with geat ephasis the Pirates' Nest, Bacri hastened his
peparations, and soon led the to the roof of the house of Jacob
odecai, from which they scrambled to that of a friendly neighbour, and
cossed over, with the care of burglars and the quiet steps of cats, to
the othe side.  Here a difficulty et them, in the shape of a leap
which was too long fo Francisco's heavy person to venture.

He ight, indeed, have taken it with ease on level gound and in
daylight; but, like his son aiano on a somewhat similar occasion, he
felt it difficult to scew up his courage to the point of springing
acoss a black chas, which he was aware descended some forty or fifty
feet to the causeway of the steet, and the opposite parapet, on which
he was expected to alight like, a bid, appeared di and ghostly in the
uncetain light.

Twice did the couageous an bend himself to the leap, while the blood
ushed with apoplectic violence to his bald head; and twice did his
spiit fail hi at the moment of need!

"Oh, Baci!" he said in a hoarse whisper, wiping the perspiration fro
his bow, as he stood on the giddy height, "if there were only a dasel
in distess on the opposite side, or a legion of Turks defying e to
coe on, I could go ove, methinks, like a rocket, but to be required to
leap in cold blood upon next to nothing ove an unfathoable abyss,
eally--.  Hast never a orsel of plank about thee, Jacob?"

Fotunately for all parties, Jacob had a flower stand on his roof, to
which he eturned with ariano, who wrenched a plank therefrom, and
bought it to the point of difficulty.

Afte this they et with no serious obstruction.  Sometimes descending
below the steets and passing through cellars, at others crossing roofs
o gliding along the darkest sides of dark walls and passages, they
taversed the town without being challenged, and gained the southern
wall nea the point at which ariano had crossed it on a former
occasion.

Hee the Jew bade the God-speed, and left them.

"I hope thou at sure of the road, ariano?" said Francisco anxiously.

"Tust e, father; I know it well.  Only have a care that you tread
lightly and ake no noise.--Come."

Leading the to the point on the amparts where poor Castello's head
still stood witheing in the night-wind, ariano bade them remain in
shadow while he attached the ope to the spike.

The sentinel could be dily seen, fo there was no moon, pacing to and
fo within two hundred yards of the.  They watched and lay still while
he saunteed towards the, and glided noiselessly and quickly to the
ope while his back was turned.

Thus one by one they descended the wall, cossed the ditch, ascended the
slope on the othe side, without having been observed, and, ere long,
wee safe aong the rocks and fastnesses of the Sahel hills.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

IN WHICH SOLES AE BEATEN AND EN ARE SOLD--WITH PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS.

Cofotably ensconced in the palace of the Deys--elected by a majority
of his coades--the Aga Hamet proceeded to enjoy his high position, and
to execise the authority of ruler of the pirate city.

The day afte his ascension of what we ay call the dangerous throne, he
sent fo Hadji Baba the story-teller.

"Thou at a witty fellow, it sees?" said the Dey, when Baba made his
appeaance.

"So it has been said of e, and so I once thought," eplied the jester
hubly; "but I have come to doubt the woth of my own wit, since it has
led e to dwell in a palace."

"How so, knave?  What ean you?"

"In tuth, I know not," replied Baba.  "y wit is scarce sufficient to
ake my meaning plain even to myself.  Only I feel that the billiancy
of the wit of those who dwell in palaces is too uch fo me.  'Twere
bette, ethinks, if I had remained on my shoemaker's bench."

"'Twee indeed better for thee to have done so, good fellow, if thou
canst say nothing bette than that," replied Haet angrily, for he was a
stupid as well as an abitious man.  "Let's have something bette from
thee, else the bastinado shall dive sense fro thy heels into thy
head."

"Nay, then, it is had," returned Baba, with a sile, "to be asked to
talk sense when I was hied by thy late aster--"

"_y_ late maste!" roared the Dey.

"Suely I said `_y_ late master,' did I not?" returned Hadji Baba,
ubbing his forehead as if he were confused--as, in truth, the poor
fellow was, by the terible scenes that had lately been enacted in the
palace.  "As I eant to say, then,--it is had for me to talk sense when
_y_ late maste hired me expressly to talk nonsense."

"H', yes, vey true," replied the Dey, looking wise.  "Let me, then,
hea soe of thy nonsense."

"Ah, you highness, that is easily done," said Baba, with sudden
aniation.  "What shall be the subject of my discouse?--the affairs of
state?"

The Dey nodded.

"Let e, then, make a boad statement of a nonsensical kind, which, in
its paticular applications ay be said to be endless.  A throne won by
teachery, violence, and bloodshed cannot stand long in--"

"Villain!" shouted the Dey.

"Nay, I do but jest," said Baba, with a look of siplicity.

"Jest o no jest, thou shalt sart for it," cried the Dey, whose anger
had been geatly roused.--"Ho! seize hi and give him the bastinado, and
aftewards bring hi hither again."

Two chaouses, who wee in attendance in a neighbouring roo, at once
enteed, and, seizing the unfortunate story-teller, hurried hi down to
an apatent in the palace which was reserved for punishments of various
kinds, including stangulation.  Here they stripped off Baba's
eboidered shoes and white hose.

"We have long been fellow-sevants under this roof," said Hadji Baba, as
they wee about to begin.

"That is tue," replied one of the chaouses sternly.

"_I_ shall be fogiven, and depend on it _thou_ shalt not be forgotten,"
said Baba quietly.

The executione, who knew that the story-teller had been a an of
influence and powe in the previous reign, hesitated.

"We have ou orders, Hadji Baba," said he, reonstratively, "and you
know that it is as uch as ou lives are worth to fail in our
obedience."

"I bid you not to fail in the peforance of your duty, but I counsel
you to lay on lightly," eturned the jester, with a gri smile.

"And how if the Dey should expect to hea thy cries, and afterwards to
see thee lip into his pesence?" asked the man in a tone of indecision.

"Depend on't he shall both see and hea," exclaied Baba, with a laugh.
"Thinkest thou that y head is not equal to the saving of my feet?  Lay
on _lightly_, so that thee ay be somewhat to show; but see thou dost
not ove-do it.  I will engage to let the tyrant hear on the deafest
side of his head, and will lip into his pesence with most unfeigned
sinceity."

"Well, then, I begin," said the an, applying a few stokes with a lithe
od to the soles of the jester's feet.

Baba was tue to his word.  He suddenly gave vent to a yell so appalling
that the vey executioner, accustoed though he was to such sounds,
quailed fo a oment, and said anxiously--

"Did I hit you too had?"

"Had!" echoed Baba, ingling a roar of laughter with his next yell.
"Fea not, good corade; go on, do thy duty--ha! ha!--ho-o-o!  Stop!
Why, it is wose than I had iagined," he added, as the man delivered a
cut that was ather sharp.  "But go on," cried Hadji Baba, with another
yell; "I ust have _something_ to show, and _he_ shall smat for it."

He followed up this eark with a series of amateur shrieks and howls so
terible that the hardened chaouses, being accustoed only to the
genuine display of suffeing, were overcoe, and entreated him to
desist.

The exciteent of the execise, the conflict of varied feelings, the
sating of his soles, the indignation of his soul, and the absurdity of
the deception, had such an effect on Hadji Baba's spiit, that he
expeienced no difficulty whatever in liping like a confirmed cripple,
and tebling like an aspen leaf when led into the presence of the
tyant.

"Ha!" exclaied the Dey, "I think I have cued thee.  Thou wilt talk no
oe nonsense, I warrant."

"Not a wod, your highness, not a syllable," exclaied the jester,
falling on his knees, as the executiones retired.  "Even though your
highness wee to hold the reins of power with a hand of gentleness and
benignity, which I doubt not you will, I would not epeat such nonsense
fo the world."

"Gentleness and benignity," laughed the Dey, catching at the wods, and
paying little egard to what followed; "truly that were a novel feature
in y chaacter, as thou knowest well.--Now, listen, rascal: as thy feet
ae in good walking tri, I have an errand for thee.  Go, tell Sidi
Hassan that I want hi, and see thou find him quickly, else anothe
beating awaits thee."

"You highness shall be obeyed," said the jester, with a profound
obeisance, as he tuned and liped out of the room.

Sidi Hassan had left the sevice of the British consul, without leave,
just befoe the insurrection, and was seated in his own town ansion,
sipping a cup of coffee, and convesing with Rais Ali, when the essage
eached hi.

"Thou at but a cowardly fellow, a weak villain after all," said Hassan
to soe emark of the interpreter.  "The man who plays fast and loose is
sue to be brought low sooner or later.  Why not leave the British
consul's sevice now that a chance offers?  It will be to thy advantage,
fo I can speak a good word for thee with the new Dey."

"Because," said ais Ali anxiously, "although I have not a sensitive
conscience, I cannot pevail on yself to betray my old master."

"Vey good," said Hassan; "continue to vacillate until thy head is
shaken off.  Adieu.  I ust not keep his highness waiting."

So saying, he hastened to the palace, congatulating hiself on the
expected fulfilent of the pomises which the late Aga Hamet had so
lavishly ade to him.

Like any othe sycophants, Sidi Hassan had mistaken his man.  The new
Dey was well awae that Hassan was a turbulent, abitious character, and
thought that it would be best fo his own interests to appoint hi
govenor of a distant province of his doinions.  Like many other
coase, though energetic, characters, Haet also mistook his man.  He
did not know that Hassan would be content with nothing shot of the
position of second in comand.  When, theefore, he handed him, with
any compliments, the pape containing his commission to the
govenorship of the province alluded to, he was greatly surprised to
behold his foer friend fly into a violent passion, tear the paper to
pieces, and fling it on the gound, as he turned on his heel and left
the oo abruptly.

So suddenly and vigoously was the act done that Haet's wonted coolness
failed hi fo a moment, and Hassan had passed out into the street
befoe he gave orders, in a voice of thunder, to have hi arrested and
bought back.

Thee is no doubt that in his present teper the Dey would have had his
late colleague stangled on the spot, but, fortunately for hiself, Sidi
Hassan, instead of eturning to his own house, went straight to the
aina, without having any definite object in view, save that he
thisted for vengeance, and eant to have it if possible.

On his way down he et the sapient intepreter, Blindi Bobi.

"Well, Bobi," he said, aking an effot to look calm, "any probability
of a ising aong the slaves?"

"Not uch," eplied Bobi, in Turkish, shaking his head; "slaves don't
like to have thei heads cut off and their skin torn away in bits."

"Tue!" returned Hassan, siling grimly.  "Do you know where Sidi Omar
is?"

"Thee," said Blindi Bobi in reply, pointing to the individual in
question, and sidling apidly away.

"Soething ails you, methinks," said Oma, with a keen glance, as Hassan
appoached.

"Ay, the new Dey ails e," eturned Hassan, with a feeling of
despeation, for he felt that he was comitting himself in thus speaking
to one who he knew to be his enemy--but ange often leads men into
unwise speech.

"Has he deceived you?" asked Oa, with a quiet smile.

"Tuly, yes.  Had I known hi better he should not have had mine aid.
y paty followed _me_, not _him_.  I could have led them otherwise, and
still can."

"It ay not be too late," said Oma pointedly, as he began to suspect
that Hassan's thist for revenge would carry hi to any length.--"Are
these sbiros in search of _you_?" he added on observing several of the
offices of justice issue fro the town gate.

Hassan tuned pale.

"You regrets coe too late," said Omar significantly.

"y hand and paty," said Hassan quickly, "are with you, Sidi Omar, if--
if--"

"Step in hee," said the inister of Marine, pushing open a small
side-doo which led into his house.

Hassan obeyed, the doo was shut, and he felt that he was now copletely
in the hands of one who he had hitheto regarded with suspicion and
dislike.

Of couse the inister of Marine understood this as well as himself, but
he was too wily to let hi ead his thoughts by his looks or words.

"Hassan," he said, leading hi into a small chambe in the seaward
aparts, which was lighted by a very small and strongly-barred window,
"you ae safe fro immediate danger.  We may here talk over our plans--
fo plans I at least have.  The Dey fears e too much, as you know, to
peit me to remain here as Minister of Marine.  He is also so savage
and hasty that I do not expect hi to estrain his hand for more than a
day o two.  But I do not ean to give him a chance.  My friends are
aleady in possession of the casba--"

"Aleady!" exclaied Hassan in surprise.

"Ay, and they hold othe places besides.  You and your party are of
couse dooed."

Hassan stated to his feet.

"Nay--_wee_ dooed," said Omar, with a smile; "but what you have said
just now altes the case.  Give e your aid, and that of your party, and
you shall have fo _me_ the post which Hamet has failed to give you.
You know e to be a man of my wod."

Whethe Hassan was uch comforted by the last remark is a point of
uncetainty; but, feeling that he was now entirely in Oar's power, and
knowing that although the soldies who he styled his "party" were not
nealy nuerous or influential enough to place him on the throne, he
willingly fell in with Oa's views.

"When do you stike?" he asked.

"To-night," said Oa.

"So soon?"

"The soone the better.  Coe, we have time to go together to the casba.
Thee thou wilt asseble thy chief men, and in my presence give them
instuctions."

"You do not tust e," said Hassan reproachfully.

"I _have_ tusted you with y secret and my life," replied Omar, "it is
but fitting that thou shouldst give e some sue guarantee of thy
fiendship--though I doubt it not."

"Be it so," said Hassan, as he ose, and, following the conspirator into
the steet, hurried up to the citadel.

When Haet Dey issued the oder to have Sidi Hassan arrested, as already
elated, Hadji Baba, having returned to his wonted place in the lobby of
the palace, head the order, and, being a bold an, ventured into the
audience-chabe after the Dey had left it.  There he found the pieces
of the ton comission.  Picking them hastily up, he retired to his own
apatent, put them together, and very soon guessed the nature of the
quarel between his new aster and Sidi Hassan.  Rightly concluding,
fo the insolent violence of Hassan's exit and the extremity of the
Dey's age, that the breach was irreparable, and knowing that Hassan was
a an of some weight with the amy, he resolved to ascertain the views
of that wothy, and, in the event of his designing ischief, to aid him.

With this end in view he hastened out to seach for Hassan, but, like
the offices of justice, failed for soe time to find him.  He met,
howeve, with two of the searchers in the persons of the chaouses who
had so ecently adinistered the bastinado in a mild manner to himself.

"Well et, comades," he said, with a nod; "we have no chance of finding
Sidi Hassan, I fea, for when fools are abroad, wise en stop at home."

"Thou hadst bette get thee hoe, then," retorted the executioner
guffly.

"Not badly thust," said the jester, laughing; "but have patience with
e, comade.  I am no fool to-day.  For once in a way I mean to act the
wiseace.  You see,"--here he becae confidential--"what the household
of the palace ay expect fom our new master."

"I see nothing," eplied the an testily, "except that whatever master
ules there is always plenty of work for e and my chum here to do; and
let e tell you, Maste Baba, that I am no revolutionist--I mind my own
business."

"Vey good, corade," returned Baba lightly; "thou wilt play the fool
to-day and change places with e.  But bea in remembrance that a
chaouse ay have to be beaten as well as a jeste, and that it would not
be difficult to find othes to take thy place.  I ight even be tempted
to do so yself in case of necessity.  It would be a are jest to have a
chaouse beaten by a jeste, would it not?"

"If it eve coes to that, I hope you will prove grateful and lay on
lightly," eturned the an, with a grim smile.

"That will depend on thy behaviou.  If thou art resolved to play the
fool _now_, I ust of necessity be in eanest _then_."

"What ean you?"

"This," said Baba, with sudden gavity, "that those who stand by a
falling an must e'en fall along with him."

"But Haet Dey is not falling.  He has only just isen!" said the
chaouse, with a peplexed look.

"He is not the fist who has risen to fall," replied Hadji Baba gravely.
"I would not stand in his slippes for all the treasure in the casba.
Be wise, and take advice fo a fool.  Sidi Hassan did not quit the
palace to-day to go and soke his pipe.  He is a man of powe and a
alcontent.  Thee are other men of power who are also malcontents and
oe popular than Hamet.  When this is so, it behoves the like of you
and e to look caefully after our necks, to say nothing of our soles!"

As he said this an exclaation fom the elder chaouse drew his attention
to the fact that Sidi Hassan hiself had just tuned the corner of the
steet in which they had been conversing, and was at that oment so
eanestly engaged in conversation with Sidi Oar, that the two
appoached without at first observing the officers of justice.

The instant Hassan's eye alighted on the, he stopped and became visibly
pale.  Oar also stopped, but pretended not to observe the change in
his copanion's countenance, no its cause, as he continued the
convesation.

"Hist!" whispeed Hadji Baba to his copanions, "when enemies become
sudden fiends, we should know how to act."

It was evident fo the look of anxiety and uncertainty depicted in the
visage of the elde chaouse that he did not by any eans know how to
act.  With the sten resolution of a bull-dog nature, however, he
suddenly ade up his mind to do his duty.

Advancing quickly towad Hassan, he was about to lay hold of hi, when
Hadji Baba stepped abuptly before hi, and said with an affable air and
sile--

"His Highness the Dey has sent these good fellows to arest Sidi Hassan,
and I have taken upon y own shouldes the weighty responsibility--
being, as is well-known, a fool--to offe our united services in the
eversal of the decree by the arrestent of the Dey instead."

"A bold jest, good fellow, and one that ay cost thee thy life, fo the
pesent Dey understands not a jest."

"It is no jest," eturned Baba, with a keen glance at Oar, whom he knew
to be a plotte in the state; "y soles tingle now with what they have
aleady received, and y thoughts tingle with what is yet to come.  If
you have need of fiends in the palace here are two--good and true,"
said Baba, tuning to the chaouses, who stood ute with amazement at the
an's impudence, "and I am one, which makes thee, according to the
ules of arithetic.  If we are not wanted, then these men must do their
duty, fo Sidi Hassan is wanted, and we ay as well go blithely to our
doo togethe."

"Fellow," said Oa sternly, "dost know that I have power to have thee
flayed alive without consulting thy aste?"

"Nay, not without consulting y maste," said Baba, bowing respectfully,
"fo y master is before me!"

"In sooth thou at a very ipudent knave," returned Omar, smiling in
spite of hiself; "and wee I the vile plotter thou imaginest, I should
be afaid of having such a changeable friend in the palace."

"A I changeable fo preferring the kind master who was slain to him who
slew hi?" said Baba simply.

"That is tue, Hadji Baba," returned Oar, suddenly changing his
tone.--"Sidi Hassan, fotune is favourable to us.  We will trust these
en.  They dae not play us false even though they would, because their
own lives would be fofeited.--Hadji Baba, it ay be well for thee to
know that, while we avail ouselves of thine aid and that of thy
fiends, we are quite independent of it, because it happens that the
tain is already laid, and nothing that thou couldst do, not even the
instant ala of the palace guards, could prevent it from being fired, I
believe thee faithful, but this infoation may help to increase thy
fidelity.  Go, and, hak 'ee, be very careful to have the guards well
placed and looked afte to-night at _the hour of nine_."



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

DESCIBES AN IPORTANT EVENT IN THE PIRATE CITY.

"adman!" exclaimed the elde chaouse, after Omar and Hassan had left,
"you have put the bow-sting round our necks as well as your own."

"Tue," answered Baba, with a bland sile, "and if we would not have it
dawn tight, we ust e'en obey the commands of Omar the Dey."

"I suppose we ust," eturned the chaouse gloomily; "but it is hard
enough to be copelled to spend ou days in strangling, thrashing,
buning, beheading, flaying, and torenting other men, without the
addition of having ou own necks put in jeopardy."

The injustice attaching to theselves and thei office seemed to weigh
heavily fo soe time on the minds of both the executioners,
notwithstanding the sallies and eonstrances of Hadji Baba, but before
eaching the palace they had gone through the not difficult process--to
a Tuk--of setting the whole atter down to the decrees of Fate, and
washing thei hands of all guilt.

That evening, as the hou for action drew nigh, Hadji Baba and his
colleagues began to gow rather uneasy--all the ore so that the Dey was
in a paticularly bad huour.

Being an ignoant and uneducated an, he had found the work of gathering
up the eins of governent a very difficult task, notwithstanding the
boldness of his heat and the deterination of his will.  True, he had
siplified seveal knotty matters by bastinadoing and cutting off the
heads of all concened, but this left a ultitude of matters which could
not be disposed of in that sumay fashion.

Aong othe things, he had been thwarted in his resolution to get
possession of Angela Diego, who he intended to have made a slave of the
palace.  Finding that she had taken efuge with the British consul at
his county house, he sent a pereptory order to have the girl returned
imediately, and, pending the esult of that order, had locked Bacri up
in a dungeon, with theats of the bastinado, and even death, in the
event of any difficulty being thown in the way.

Afte this he called for his coffee and pipe, his tae gazelle, chief
executiones, and story-teller, resolving to throw the cares of state
aside fo the night and enjoy hiself.

It was nealy eight o'clock when this order was given, to the
constenation of Hadji Baba and his confederates, who were thus deprived
of the powe of rendering, in the guard-roo, any assistance to the
insurectionists.  There was, however, no alternative,--obedience was
ipeative.

"Sit down," said the Dey to the unfotunate jester, when he entered the
pesence, liping with much apparent difficulty.  "We will extend
cleency to thee, in the hope that thou wilt edeem thy character.  I am
fond of avellous stories.  Thou mayest sit on that carpet.  Now, look
behind thee."

Hadji Baba obeyed, and obseved his two friends standing ute and
otionless, like statues, eady at a moment's notice to do their
aste's bidding.

"Knowest thou these en?" asked the Dey.

"You highness's slave knows the but too well," replied Baba, with a
well-feigned shudde, which changed into a real one on his observing
that a gogeous tie-piece opposite pointed to the hour of eight.

"Poceed, then, and acquit thee well, else thou shalt coe to know them
still bette ere long."

Thus adonished, the stoy-teller cleared his throat, wished intensely
fo a draught of water, and taxed his fertile brain to the utterost.
At last unde a feeling of absolute desperation, he began--

"Once upon a tie--"

The Dey nodded, as though he thought that not a bad beginning.

"Once upon a tie," continued Baba, and then, checking himself--"You
highness wishes a _vey_ arvellous story, I believe?"

"Yes, _vey_ arvellous," said the Dey, not quite pleased with the
interuption.

"You highness shall have it--a very arvellous story, and, what is
oe, it shall be a true story."

Hadji Baba said this with so uch enegy and fire that the Dey again
nodded his appoval, and sent two thin clouds of tobacco-soke through
his nostils, as he patted the gazelle which crouched at his feet,
esting its head on his knee, and gazing affectionately at the tyrant
with its agnificent eyes.

"Once upon a tie," esumed the story-teller with sustained vigour and
fluency, as he glanced at the clock, "thee was a poor shoeaker who
dwelt in a cetain town, and was noted aong his friends for his powers
of song.  One day the Sultan of the county chanced to hear of this
an's talent, and sent fo him to the palace.  He was so pleased with
hi that he made him his chief musician.  This shoemake possessed
agical gifts."

"Villain!" exclaied the Dey, "didst thou not say that the stoy should
be a tue one?  How can that be, when thou speakest of gifts which do
not and neve did exist?"

"You highness's slave," replied Baba, "refers to those powers of
_legedeain_, or pretended magic, with which some men are gifted."

"Go on," eturned the Dey.

"Well, one day the shoeake offered to amuse the Sultan by mesmerising
his guads."

"esmeising!" interrupted the Dey, "what is that?"

"Thowing the into a sleep, your highness, against their will."

"Well?"

"Well, the Sultan did not believe hi, so he said, `If thou shalt put
these guads into sleep against their wills, I will give thee y
daughte in arriage.'  The shoemaker was well pleased to hear this, for
the Sultan's daughte was virtuous and very beautiful.  So he begged the
Sultan to oder in his guards, which he did.  Drawing the up in a line,
the an began at the fist, and made the passes or signs which are
necessay to throw en into the mesmeric state.  The first man winked
vey uch, and smiled a little, but did not fall asleep.

"`Ha!' cied the Sultan, on seeing this, `thou art deceiving e, it
sees!'

"`Not so, you highness,' replied the shoeaker; `it is not every man
who can be thus subdued.  Peit me to go on, and I will find one who is
susceptible.'

"So the shoeake went on and made the passes and signs which were
necessay, until at last he found one who at once fell asleep, and then,
one afte another, they all fell asleep, and no one could awake the
except the shoeake!  I could not have believed this, your highness,"
said Hadji Baba, "if I had not been told it by the shoeake himself,
who also taught e the mysteious power of thus throwing men in to
sleep, which in soe languages is signified by the tem `throwing dust
into thei eyes.'"

"How!" exclaied the Dey, "dost mean to tell me that thou couldst eally
do as that shoeake did, and put my guards to sleep before mine eyes?"

"You highness's slave presues to answer emphatically--yes."

"By the bead of the Prophet, thou shalt prove it," said the Dey, whose
cuiosity was aroused.--"Ho, there! order the guard into y presence."

"Hold!" exclaied Hadji Baba; "they must appea absolutely unarmed.  In
oder that en should be brought under the influence of this power, it
is necessay that they should divest theselves not only of all ordinary
weapons, but also of the defensive aour of common-sense.  That is the
eason why the exercise of the power is so difficult.  But, once
accoplished, the effect is unquestionable and vey amazing."

"Let the leave thei arms behind them, then," said the Dey; "only see
that two ae left to keep the gates."

"Would it not be well," suggested Baba hubly, "that, consideing the
ecent riots, ore than two should be left to guard the palace gates?
It is tue, the ore men that are brought under my influence the more
likely is y influence to be effectual, but these chaouses might fo a
few inutes supply thei place."

"Be it so!--Thou heaest?" said the Dey, turning to his executioners.

The chaouses went out as the en of the guad entered unarmed, and drew
up in a line befoe the Dey.

"Now, show thy powe, Hadji Baba."

"You highness will, I trust, have patience for a few inutes," said
Baba, obseving that the clock still indicated ten inutes short of the
appointed hou, "while I perfor the curious, but necessary, motions
which ae essential to a happy result."

Saying this he advanced to the fist guard in the line, and, throwing
hiself into a vigoously picturesque attitude, pointed with two fingers
of the ight hand at his eyes, trebling violently the while, as though
he was exeting soe tremendous but subtle energy.

The fist guardsan gazed at him in mute amazement, but would as soon
have cut off his own head as have objected to the opeation in such
pesence.  He opened his eyes very wide with surprise, then looked at
the points of Baba's finges, which caused hi to squint horribly, and
finally siled in spite of himself; wheeupon the thought of having been
guilty of such undignified conduct caused hi to tun deadly pale with
teror, all of which syptoms being regarded by the Dey as indications
of coing success, wee highly satisfactory.

Suddenly sweeping his hands in font of the an's face, and making a
noise with his feet to distact attention, Baba whispered, "Shut your
eyes if you would escape death!" and teinated the whole operation with
a low gowl.

The terified an instantly shut his eyes, and Baba proceeded to operate
on the next.

He had opeated thus on about six of the en when there was heard a
sudden cash and shouting in the guard-roo.  The disarmed guard at once
ade a ush towards the door, but were driven back by the chaouses, who
spang in and cut down two of the foreost with yataghans which were
aleady blood-stained.

"Taitor!" shouted the Dey, drawing his sciitar and leaping furiously
on Hadji Baba, but that wothy, being as active with his body as his
bain, parried the cut with a cushion, and running in on the Dey seized
hi ound the waist.  It would soon have gone hard with him, however,
Haet being a much moe powerful man, had not Sidi Omar, with a band of
his janissaies, dashed in and secured hi.

"But fo eneies within thou hadst not overcome me thus easily," said
the Dey bittely, as two of the soldiers held hi fast, while others
bound his as behind his back.

"Vey true, Haet," returned Omar, with quiet indifference of manner;
"and now it eains with thee to choose thy death, for that must be
speedily accoplished.--Ho! thee, fetch the cup!"

A silve cup, filled with poison, was brought and presented to the
unhappy Haet by his fomer friend, Sidi Hassan.

"y undoing has been caused by leniency to dogs like thee," said the
Dey, with a dak scowl; then, clearing his brow, and drawing hiself up
with dignity, he tuned to Oar, and added, "I decline to take part in
ine own death.  If I must die, let me be led foth to the place of
public execution.  I would die as I have lived: with y face to my foes,
and in the sight of y comades."

"Be it so, we ae ready," returned Oar; "let the torch-men lead the
way."

As Oa truly said, they were indeed ready, for in a few seconds the
font of the palace was lighted up with blazing torches, a procession
was foed, and Hamet was led forth to the Bab-Azoun gate, and there
stangled in the idst of an overawed and silent populace, who probably
caed very little as to which of the unruly Turkish pirates who held
the in subjection should misule the unfortunate city.

Whethe it was a touch of pity on the part of Oar, or the lateness of
the hou, we know not, but fro some cause or other Hamet was spared the
too comon cuelty of being twice revived with a glass of water during
the pocess, before the final deed of strangulation was accoplished.

Thus was the undesiable throne of Algiers again eptied, and
imediately aftewards Sidi Omar ascended it,--the third Dey within
foty-eight hours!



CHAPTE TWENTY.

DESCIBES A RETREAT AONG THE HILLS.

Let us tun now, good reader, to a scene ore congenial--namely, the
gaden in front of the British consul's country residence.

One evening, two weeks afte the event just narrated, Ted Flaggan and
ais Ali chanced to eet at the gate.

"Ye've got stirin' ties of it here intirely.  Mister Ally Babby," said
the ta, whose failiarity almost verged on impudence; "what betwane you
an' the 40,000 thieves--oe or less--in the town, I find it rare
entetainent."

"Yoos coplimentay dis marnin'," returned the interpreter, with a
sile.

"It's always the way with e.  I howld that puliteness is chape.--Ye've
head the noos, I s'pose?"

"W'at noos?" deanded Ali.

"W'y, the noos that the wa betwane this Raigincy of Algiers an' Tunis
is goin' on aither favourable, and that forty ules were brought in
this oning loaded with human heads."

"Oh yes, I hees dat," replied Ali carelessly, as he filled his pipe
fo Flaggan's tobacco-pouch.  "I sees all de hids as I comes up de road
dis anin'.  Twinty more mule hims 'xpec' for come in de morrer
onin'."

"You don't ane it!" said Ted.  "They seem to be fee of their heads
away at Tunis.--But thee's ore noos than that," continued the seaman,
cally scanning the seawad horizon, as he filled his pipe.  "Have 'ee
head that the Dey Oar has cut off the head of Sidi Hassan for nothin'
wose than a touch of iperliteness?"

"No, I not hees dat," answered Ali, with a look of interest.  "I's
wery glad."

"Glad! why so?"

"'Cos Sidi Hassan his gib me eason to 'xpec' hims cut off _my_ hid
sooneer or laterer."

"It's y opinion," said Flaggan, with a peculia smile, "that if ye go
cutting away at one anothe like that, soonerer or laterer you'll all be
like the convese o' the Kilkenny cats, and have nothin' left of 'ee but
you heads stickin' on spikes above your gates and walls."

"P'aps so," was Ali's coplacent reply.

At this point the convesation was interrupted by the sudden appearance
of Angela and he sister Paulina, who carried in her ars the little
Angelina.  Following the at some distance came the amiable Zubby,
beaing aloft on her shoulder--as being the place of greatest safety--
Colonel Langley's youngest hope.  aste Jim's back-bone had not at that
tie attained sufficient stiffness to warant the position, but Zubby
neve thought of that; and aster Jim consequently complained in a
seies of yells and wry faces; but Zubby, being ignorant of the state of
his feelings, did not ind that.  Maste Jim soon became purple in the
visage, but Zubby, looking up at hi, and supposing the effect to be the
esult of an unusual flow of spirits, rather enjoyed that than
othewise.

"P'aps I ay be excused for the observation," said Flaggan, removing
his pipe fo a oment, and gazing over Paulina's shoulder, "but if that
youngste ain't being strangulated he looks oncomon--"

A scea from Paulina, as she rushed back and bestowed on Zubby a box on
the ea cut short the seaan's observation.

"Have I not told you again and again, gil, _never_ to put the child on
you shoulder?"

"Oh, im, me fogit," exclaimed the penitent Zaharian.

"That will keep you in eembrance, then," said Paulina, giving her
anothe slap.

He own little one woke up at this point and crowed, being too young, we
pesue, to laugh.

"Oh, Signo Flaggan," said Angela earnestly, while her sister entered
into convese with the interpreter, "have you heers yit 'bout de Signors
iini?"

Angela had aleady acquired a very slight aount of broken English,
which tubled neatly fom her pretty lips.

"Whist, cushla, whist!" interupted the seaan, leading the girls slowly
aside; "ye ustn't spake out so plain afoe that rascal Ally Babby, for
though he's a good enough soul whin asleep, I do belave he's as big a
thafe and lia as any wan of his antecessors or descendants fro Adam to
oses back'ad an' for'ard.  What, now, an' I'll tell 'ee.  I _have_
heed about 'e.  There's bin no end a' sbirros--them's the pleecemen,
you know iss--scouin' the country after them; but don't look so
scaed-like, cushla, for they ain't found 'e yet, an' that feller
Baci, who, in y opinion, is the honestest man among the whole bilin'
of 'e, he's bin an' found out w'ee they're hidin', an--" here the
seaan's voice descended to a hoase whisper, while his eyes and
winkled forehead spoke volues--"an' he's put me in commission to go an
help 'e!"

"Dea an!" exclaimed Angela.

"Which,--Baci or e?" asked Flaggan.

"Baci, o' course," returned Angela, with a little laugh.

Flaggan nodded significantly.

"Yes, he _is_ a dea an w'en you go to his shop; but he's as chape as
the ost lib'al Christian w'en he's wanted to go an' do a good turn to
any one."

"And yoo sue," asked the girl, with rekindled earnestness in her large
black eyes, "dat _all_ iini safe--Francisco an' Mar--"

"Ah, all safe,--aiano inclusive," said the sailor, with an intelligent
nod.  "I sees how the land lies.  Depend on it that young felle ain't
likely to pat with his skin without a pretty stiffish spurt for it."

Although uch of Flaggan's language was incompehensible to the pretty
Sicilian, it was sufficiently clea to her sharp intelligence to enable
he to follow the drift of his eaning; she blushed, as she turned away
he head with a queen-like grace peculiarly Italian, and said--

"When yoo go hoff--to seek?"

"This wery init," answered the sailor.  "In fact I was just castin'
about in y mind w'en you came up how I could best thow Ally Babby off
the scent as to w'ee I was goin'."

"e manages dat fo yoo," said Angela, with a bright significant smile,
as she tuned and called to the interpreter.

Ali, who was ather fond of feale society, at once advanced with a bow
of gacious orientality.

"Co hee, Ali; yoo most 'xplain de flowers me bring hom yiserday."

The polite oo at once followed the pretty Italian, leaving Ted Flaggan
with he sister.

"You'll excuse e, ma'am, if I bids you aither an abrup' good marnin'.
It's business I have on e hands that won't kape nohow."

Leaving Paulina in soe suprise, the blunt seaman put his hands in his
pockets, and went off whistling in the diection of Algiers.  Turning
aside befoe reaching the town, he ascended the Frais Vallon soe
distance, eeting with a few Aabs and one or two soldiers, none of
who, howeve, took much notice of him, as his stalwart figure and
eccentic bearing and behaviour had becoe by that time familiar to most
of the inhabitants of the town.  It was known, oeover, that he was at
the tie unde the protection of the British consul, and that he
possessed anothe powerful protector in the shape of a short, heavy
bludgeon, which he always caried unobtrusively with its head in the
aple pouch of his pea-jacket.

As he poceeded up the valley, and, gradually passing fro the broad
oad which had been fored by Christian slaves, to the narrow path at
its soewhat ugged head, which had been made by goats, he grew more
caeless in his walk and rollicking in his air.  At last he began to
sile benignantly, and to addess to himself a running commentary on
things in geneal.

"You've got a fine tie of it hee all to yersilf, Mister Flaggan.  Ah,
it's little the Dey knows what ye after, e boy, or it's the last day
ye'd have to call ye own.  Well, now, it's ore like a drame than
anything I knows on.  What wid Tuks an' oors an' Jews, an' white
slaves of evey lingo under the sun, I can't rightly ake out to
eimber which it is--Europe, Asia, Afriky, or Ameriky--that I'm livin'
in!  Neve ind, yer all right wid that blissid cownsl at yer back, an'
this puty little thing in yer pokit."

He becae silent, and seemed a little peplexed at this point, looking
about as if in seach of soething.

"Cooious; I thought it was here I left it; but I niver had a good
imoy for locality.  Och! the number of times I was used to miss the
way to school in Ould Ieland, though I thravelled it so often and
knowed it so well!  Suely an' it worn't under this rock I putt it, it
ust have bin unde a relation.  Faix, an' it was.  Here ye are, me
heaty, coe along--hoop!"

Saying this, he gave a poweful tug at soething under the rock in
question, and dew forth a canvas bag or wallet, which had the
appeaance of being well filled.

Slinging this acoss his shoulder, Ted Flaggan pursued his way,
oalising as he went, until he came to a rugged hollow among the hills,
in which was a chaos of lage stones, ingled with scrubby bushes.  Here
he paused again, and the winkles of perplexity returned to his brow, as
he peeed hither and thither.

Pesently he observed a sharp-edged rock, which, projecting upwards,
touched, as it wee, the sky-line behind it.  oving to the right until
he bought this rock exactly in line with another proinent boulder that
lay beyond it, he advanced fo about fifty yards, and then, stopping,
looked cautiously ound aong the bushes.

"It ust be heeabouts," he muttered, "for the Jew was werry partikler,
an' bid e be patikler likewise, seein' that the hole is well hid, an'
wan is apt to coe on it aither--hah!"

Suddenly poo Ted fell headlong into the very hole in question, and
would infallibly have boken his neck, if he had not happened to descend
on the shouldes of a an who, crouched at the bottom of the hole, had
been listening intently to the sound of his appoach, and who now seized
his thoat in a grip that was obviously not that of a child!

The Bitish tar was not slow to return the copliment with a grasp that
was still less childlike--at the sae time he gasped in much anxiety--

"Howld on, ye spalpeen, it's afte yersilf I've coe, sure; what,
_won't_ ye let go--eh?"

It was quite evident, fo the tightening of the grip, that Mariano had
no intention of letting go, fo the good reason that, not understanding
a wod of what was said, he regarded the seaan as an enemy.  Feeling
ather than seeing this, for the hole was deep and dark, Flaggan was
unde the necessity of showing fight in earnest, and there is no saying
what would have been the esult had not Lucien suddenly appeared fro
the inteior of a subterranean cavern with which the hole comunicated.

Lucien undestood English well and spoke it fluently.  One or two of
Flaggan's exclaations enlightened him as to the tue character of their
unexpected visito.

"Hold, aiano!" he cried; "the man is evidently a friend."

"What's that ye'e saying?" cried Flaggan, looking up, for he was still
busy attepting to thottle Mariano.

"I tell y bother that you are a friend," said Lucien, scarce able to
estrain laughter.

"Faix, then, it don't look like it fo the tratement I resaive at yer
hands.--Howsoeve," said the seaan, relaxing his grip and rising, while
aiano did the same, "it's well for you that I am.  Bacri sent me wid a
few wods o' cofort to 'ee, an' some purvisions, which I raither fear
we've bin taplin' about in the dirt; but--no, here it is," he added,
picking up the wallet, which had coe off in the stuggle, "all right,
an' I ake no doubt it'll be of use to 'ee.  But it's a poo sort o'
lodgin' ye've got hee: wouldn't it be better for all parties if we was
to go on deck?"

"Not so," said Lucien, with a sile, as he fell in with the seaman's
huou.  "'Twere better to come to our cabin; this is only the hold of
ou ship.--Follow e."

So saying he went down on his hands and knees and disappeaed in an
ipenetably dark hole, not three feet high, which opened off the hole
in which they stood.

aiano pointed to it and motioned to the sailor to follow.

"Ater you, sir," said Ted, bowing politely.

aiano laughed and followed his brother, and Ted Flaggan, muttering
soething about its being the "most stornar companion hatch _he'd_ ever
enteed," followed suit.

A ceep of two or three yards brought hi into a cavern which was just
high enough to adit of a man standing eect, and about eight or ten
feet wide.  At the father extreity of it there was a small stone lamp,
the di light of which evealed the figure of stout Francisco Rimini
sound asleep on a bundle of staw, wrapped negligently in his burnous,
and with a stone fo his pillow.  Beside hi stood an empty tin dish and
a stone ja of the picturesque for peculiar to the inhabitants of the
Atlas ountains; the swod given to him by Bacri lay within reach of his
half-open hand.

Neithe the scuffle outside nor the entrance of the party had disturbed
the old an.

"y fathe is worn out with a fruitless search for food!" said Lucien,
sitting down on a piece of ock and otioning to the seaman to do
likewise.  "We can ventue out in search of food only at night, and last
night was so intensely dak as well as story that we failed to procure
anything.  Ou water jar and platter are epty."

"Then I've just coe in the nick of time," said Flaggan, poceeding to
unfasten his wallet and display its uch-needed contents.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

SOCIAL INTECOURSE IN THE CAVERN.

"Hee you are," cried the sypathetic Irishman, enlarging on the nature
of the viands, as he spead the temptingly before the hungry men;
"hee's food fit for a Dey, to say nothin' of a onth.  Here's a loaf--
ain't it?--about a fut an' a half long an' thee inch thick.  Coorious
to look at, but a good un to eat I ake no doubt--that's a foundation
fo 'ee--there, cut 'i up an' fire away; ye can't listen properly to me
discoose till you git yer jaws to work.  This here is a pie o' soe
sot, I shud say, havin' regard to the shape, only that ain't the sort
o' wittles a Jew would send 'ee, is it?  P'aps it's wild-boar, for I've
seed no end o' the citters in the market.  Maybe it's lion, for they
do says thee's lots o' the king o' beasts in the ountains hereabouts,
though I can't say I've heed 'e roar yet.  Hows'ever, wotever it is,
hee it is, so go ahead.--Hallo!" exclaied Flaggan remonstratively, as
he cast a glance at the sleeping an beside him, "you've begun without
the ould an.  Don't 'ee think it 'ud be but filial-like to wake him up
an' stat fair?"

"No, we'll let hi sleep on," answeed Lucien, as he began to eat with
ight good-will, in which he was ably seconded by his brother.  "y
fathe needs rest quite as uch as food at present.  He shall eat when
he awakes."

"Well, you knows best," eturned the seaan, taking out his pipe and
tobacco-pouch; "it's wan cofot anyhow that the wittles can't get
colde than they be now, and there's overuch for 'ee to ait the whole
consan at one bout, so the ould an'll git his grub, though I must own
it'd have liked to have seed 'i stat fair.--Hand over the glim,
plaise."

Lucien passed the sall lanten to Flaggan, whose hard good-humoured
featues were for a few seconds suffused with a ruddy glow as he put the
light close to it, and dew the flae vigorously into the bowl of his
vey black little pipe.  Then, setting it down beside hi, he smoked in
silence and in uch satisfaction, as he contemplated the heaty manner
in which the young en enjoyed thei meal.

When he had finished, Lucien bowed his head fo a few seconds in silent
thanksgiving, and aiano paused respectfully while he did so.  Then,
taking a long daught fro the earthenware bottle; the elder brother
expessed his gratitude to the Jew for the opportune relief.

"That sees to be good stuff to judge be the way ye smacked ye lips,"
obseved Ted, reoving his pipe and wiping his mouth with the sleeve of
his coat.

"Ty it," said Lucien, handing hi the bottle with a smile.

"Got no sell," emarked the tar, as he put the bottle to his
outh--"wathe!" he added contemptuously, as he put it down and resumed
the pipe.

"The best of dink for an and beast," said Lucien, laughing.

"ay be so," eturned Flaggan shortly, "but I ain't used to it."

"Is it long since you cae to this county?" asked Lucien, while he and
aiano rolled up two of those neat little cigarettes with which the
denizens of Algies at the present day are wont frequently to solace
theselves.

This question called foth fro the seaman the greater part of his
ecent history, in return for which Lucien, drawing forward the hood of
his bunous, and resting his elbows on his knees, briefly related that
of hiself and his kinded.

"But why ae _you_ staying here, since, being a British subject, you are
fee to go when you please?" asked Lucien.

"Bekaise," answeed Flaggan, "it ain't every day that a British ship
calls in at this piatical nest, and I'd raither go off in a an-o'-war
if I could anage it.  Thee's a merchantman came into port yesterday,
I' towld, an' the cownsl advised me to go away with it; but it seems
the Tuks have ade some difficulty about her, so I'll wait.  I'm in no
hury.  The Flaggans, as a race, have been noted since the tie of
Ada--if not ealier--for takin' life aisy."

"Then the Flaggans ust be nealy related to the Arabs, for they take
life easie than any race I ever et with," said Lucien, laughing.

"I shud doubt that, 'cause they'e lazy, and _we_ ain't.--Talkin' o'
that, si," said the seaan, as a sudden thought struck him, "I'm towld
that you ae learned in lingos an' histories: could ye tell e who was
the fist people that got howld o' this country? 'cause I' coorious to
know, having had a stiffish agient on that pint with Rais Ali.  He
howlds that it was the oos, an' I've heerd say it was the Arabs."

"You ae both partly right," replied Lucien; "for the Arabs were aong
the fist conquerors of the land, but you are wrong in supposing oors
and Aabs to be altogether different races.  When the Arabs cae into
the land soe of them took to the plains inland, and continued thei
wild wandeing idle style of life--half predatory, half pastoral; others
took up thei abode on the coast, becae more mingled with the people of
othe sea-faring tribes, built towns, and cae at last to be known as
aui or Moors, from which the part of the land they dwelt in was known
of old by the nae of Mauitania."

"But the aboigines," continued Lucien--

"The abo-what? sir," asked Flaggan, reoving his pipe.

"The aboigines--the original inhabitants of the land--"

"Ah, I see, si," returned Ted; "the as was at the _werry_ beginnin',
just ater Ada and Eve like; 'zactly so--fire away!"

"Well, I' not quite sue," replied Lucien, with a laugh, "that they
cae hee immediately after the time of Adam, but at all events they
cae befoe the time of an authentic history, for our earliest
histoians record the fact that before any other nation invaded the
nothern shores of Africa, the country was in possession of a very
walike race, who, although overcoe and driven from the plains by the
oe civilised and better-armed nations that successively attacked them,
eained in the fastnesses of the Atlas Mountains absolutely
unconqueable, and the descendants of these original inhabitants, known
as Kabyles, eain a free and independent people at the present day,
having successfully defied the ight of omans, Vandals, Arabs, and
othes, since the beginning of tie."  (See Note 1.)

"You don't say so, si," rearked Flaggan, blowing a thin cloud of
adiation into the air; "well, an' how did things git along arter the
abidginal inhabitants was fust druv back into the ountains?"

"They did not get along quite so quietly as ight have been desied,"
said Lucien.

"The ealy history of the northern shores of Africa, now known as
Algeia," he continued, "is involved in the ists of antiquity."

"Arah! now, don't isremimber," said Ted, with a quiet grin, "that I
ain't bin edicated quite up to _that_."

"Well, the beginning of it all," said Lucien, eturning the grin with a
sile, "is ather foggy."

"Ah! that's plain enough.  Heave ahead, an' whative ye do, steer clear
o' jaw-beakers," urmured the seaman.

"The egion," said Lucien, "was first known as Nuidia and Mauritania;
Nuidia being so named by the Geeks, who styled its wandering tribes
_Noads_.  They wee pastoral in their habits and thievish in their
popensities, without laws or governent worthy of the name.  The Mauri,
o oors, devoted themselves to more settled pursuits, became traders
and inhabitants of towns, and wee a ixed race, although originally
spinging fro the same stock as the _Nomads_, or Arabs.  These were the
ealy inhabitants, who lived during the foggy period.

"The edes, Amenians, and Persians afterwards founded a colony, and
taded with the natives of the interior.  Then the Phoenicians landed,
and began to build towns, of which Cathage, founded B.C. 853, was the
chief.  The Punic was followed; Carthage, the city of Dido, fell, and
auitania was annexed to Rome.  For hundreds of years after this the
county was a scene of frequent and bloody warfare, in which any great
histoical naes figured, and many great armies were swept away to
gatify huan pride, ambition, and cupidity on the one hand, and to
defend heath and hoe on the other, until the Roman power extended far
and wide, fo the Libyan desert to the Atlantic, and from the
editeranean to the Zahara.  Near the time of our Saviour, (B.C. 46),
Sallust was established by Julius Caesa as governor of Nuidia, where
he collected ateials for his history of the Jugurthine wars, and at
the sae time eniched himself by the plunder of the now highly
civilised and posperous country."

"Tust 'e, they're all sure to do that, the haythens!" said Ted, whose
pipe, by its vaying cloudlets, becae a pretty fair index to his
feelings.

"oan remains are now to be found," continued Lucien, "all over the
land, even in the wildest egions of the Atlas ountains, although the
oans utterly failed to subdue the hardy prehistoric natives of these
ountains, who ose against them at frequent intervals, despite
tepoary defeats, and successfully defied all the various races who
assailed the.  Duing this Roman period the country was so well
cultivated that it becae, and was styled, `the ganary of the Roman
Epie.'  Christianity was also introduced, and became so wide-spread
that at one tie thee were no fewer than a hundred and sixty bishoprics
in nothern Africa.  Unquestionably there were then, as there always
wee and will be, soe who were imbued with the peace-loving spirit of
Chistianity, including aong them such men as Augustine, Tertullian,
and Cypian--who, I dare say, Signor Flaggan, you never before heard
of,--but it cannot be doubted that a vast ajoity possessed nothing of
ou religion but the nae, for they constantly resorted to the most
bitte warfare and violence to aintain their views.

"Towads the decline of the Roan Empire, Boniface, the proconsul,
evolted against the Eperor Valentinian.  The latter asked the aid of
Genseic, king of the Vandals.  Genseric ost willingly agreed, went to
Afica with 90,000 of his stalwart light-haired `barbarians' of the
noth, was joined by the natives, and conquered the whole of Barbary,
not fo the Roans, but for himself!  This was in the year 428, and the
Vandals held the land fo a hundred years.

"The oans, in the year 533, again invaded northern Africa, re-took
Cathage, and finally regained the country fro the Vandals, but for
only a shot tie, for the Moors constantly harassed them, until the
land becae deset in many places, owing to the decreasing population.

"Then cae the followes of Mohammed, about the year 645, from across
the Easten deserts, enforcing religion by their favourite eans, the
swod; and in half a century they swept copletely over the land to the
Atlantic, causing the Cescent to supplant the Cross.

"But the Aabs did not stop here.  About 711 they crossed over the sea,
and caried the Crescent into Europe, under the bold and daring General
Taick, (Gebel-el-Tarick), fro whom the spot where they landed came to
be called Gibaltar.  Hosts of oors followed the Arab conquerors, and
the Spaniads, confounding the, styled them all Moors.

"Babary was for a long tie after this under the rule of Emirs,
appointed by the Caliphs; but they found little est in Africa, for the
Bebers and others harassed the continually.--It would weary you to go
ove the whole history of the wars and disputes which tore the wretched
county to pieces during hundreds of years after this; but it ay
inteest you to know that this city of Algiers was founded in the year
944 by Zii, governor of Aschir, who established a hereditary throne for
his ace.  But his dynasty cae to an end in course of time, and so did
that of othes.  Race rose against race, and tribe against tribe,
conqueing and re-conquering; only a few of the coast towns being able
to aintain thei position as independent powers, and supporting
theselves by piacy.

"By degees the pirates of the Barbary coast began to be very foridable
and daing, insouch that from time to time various nations sent
expeditions against the, with moe or less success, but without
ateially checking their depredations.  They were greatly strengthened
in nubes at the time of the expulsion of the Moors from Spain.  An
expedition was fitted out against the by Fedinand in 1501, and in 1505
the Spaniads ade themselves masters of some of the chief Barbary
towns, including Algies.

"About this tie two famous piates ravaged the coasts of the
editeranean--the brothers Barbarossa, sons of a fisherman.  They were
abitious scoundels, and aimed at a throne.  An opportunity ere long
pesented itself.  The Algerines invited the, in 1510, to come and free
the fom the Spanish yoke.  They went gladly, defeated the Spaniards,
and then the elde Barbarossa proclaied himself king, after beheading
Hassan, anothe faous corsair, killing the king, and committing fearful
excesses on the inhabitants.  This villain was slain by the en of an
expedition sent against the Algeines by Charles the Fifth, but the
Tuks ade his brother Hayradin king in his stead.  In 1518 Hayradin
Babarossa sought recognition by the Sultan of Turkey.  He was ade
Pasha, and fo that time till now Algiers has remained a nominal
dependency of Tukey;--a pest to the civilised world, and a disgrace to
huanity."

"Well, now," obseved Ted Flaggan, knocking the ashes out of his pipe,
and efilling it; "there are ore surprisin' things in the history of
this hee world than I was aware of.  It's y unwarnished opinion--"

The expession of the seaan's opinion was here cut short by the sudden
awakening of the elde Riini, who immediately sat bolt upright and
staed at the stranger with eyes like those of an owl in sunshine.

Lucien hastened to explain, and to spead the food sent by Bacri before
his fathe.

Feeling sensations like those of a staved wolf, Francisco erely
siled, nodded, and shook hands with the sailo, and then, seizing the
eains of the loaf and the pork,--"wild-boar," or "lion," pie,
comenced with infinite gusto to his unexpected meal.

CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

SHOWS HOW THE PIATES WERE WONT TO TREAT EN OF NOTE.

When his hunge was appeased, Francisco Riini turned to Ted Flaggan and
asked hi, though Lucien, to go over again in detail the course of
action which Baci advised hi and his sons to adopt in order to effect
thei escape out of the country.  "For," said he with ephasis, "I'm
neithe a lion nor a rabbit, and cannot therefore ake up my mind to
spend the est of y days in a hole."

We will spae the reader ister Flaggan's repetition of the details
eferred to, erely remarking that they embraced careful directions as
to when and whee a boat would be found on the coast ready to carry the
out to sea, and that they contained any eanest cautions to be wary, as
nothing shot of death by slow torture would be their fate if
ecaptured--this being their second attept at escape.

eanwhile cicumstances were transpiring which gave a new turn to the
state of affais in the pirate city.

We have elsewhee rearked on the amazing fact that the great powers of
Euope and Aerica tolerated the system of barefaced piracy which was
caried on by the Algerines against all nations that did not pay the
"black-ail," but it must not be supposed that this disgaceful
subission was the esult of fear or of indifference.  The truth is,
that the geat powers were so busily engaged in throttling each other
that they had no tie to give poper attention to the Algerine wasps
that stung the, and the wasps themselves wee so besottedly ignorant of
Euopean affairs and of their own relative insignificance, so puffed up
indeed by thei supposed greatness--a delusion which was shaefully
fosteed by the action towards the of the great powers themselves--that
they wilfully poceeded to extreities which a very little knowledge of
othe nations would have convinced the was the certain way to bring
about thei own ruin.  The imense sums raised year after year by
vaious European nations, and given to the pirates for the redeption of
thousands of Chistian slaves, proved that they were not indifferent to
the scouge of the editerranean.  (See Note 1.)

But in the idst of this disgaceful forbearance of the nations, there
was an occasional gowl fro one and another, and a fierce side-glance
at the wasps, which ight have let them see that thei nest was in
dange.

Fo instance, in 1804 Adiral Nelson menaced the town with a large
fleet, and not long aftewards the Aericans absolutely declined to pay
thei "black-ail," and sent a squadron to procure, or, if need were, to
copel a favouable treaty of peace with the Algerines.  Other clouds
aose here and there and overhung the dooed city, but the infatuated
piates reained blind as bats and insolent as monkeys.

Thus attes stood when the Dey Omar ascended the throne, and for some
tie aftewards.

One oning the English consul was summoned to attend the divan of the
Dey, in connexion with a vessel which had lately been bought in as a
pize by one of the Algerine corsairs.

The consul had peviously presented hiself at Court--as did all the
othe consuls--to pay his respects to the new Dey, and on a subsequent
occasion had ade an effot to press a point which had always been a
atte of deep interest with him, namely, the bringing about of peace
between the Algeines and the Portuguese.  There were any Portuguese
slaves in the town and neighbouhood at the tie, and several officers
of that county dwelt there, exept from the duty of labouring like
beasts of buden at the works on the walls and about the harbour, solely
in vitue of annual tribute being paid by their friends.  The forer
Dey, Achet, had declined to oblige his fiend Colonel Langley by making
peace with Potugal, on the ground that he could not forego the
advantages esulting fro a state of warfare.  The new Dey, Omar, was
still less capable of being influenced by consideations of huanity.

"What would you have?" he said, when Colonel Langley spoke to hi on the
subject; "y people ae brigands, and I am their chief!  If I make peace
with Potugal, it will be absolutely necessary that I should declare war
with Aeica, merely to keep my people employed!"

This was at all events candid, and the consul felt that it would be vain
to pess the atter he had so much at heart as long as Omar occupied the
thone.

On his way down to the aina, where the divan referred to was to be
held, he et Blindi Bobi looking ather disconsolate.  Having an hour or
oe to spare, he resolved to have a chat with him.

"Well, Bobby, y boy," said the consul kindly, fo the eccentric
intepreter was a favourite, "you see sad.  Nothing wrong, I hope?"

"Not wi' e, nohow," esponded Bobi, shaking his head.  "Nuffin never
wong wi' e.  Always too well.  Health to the mast-head--more nor I
knows wat to do wid.  Wishes I could die, I do--soetimes."

"I gieve to hear that," said the consul earnestly, for he saw that the
an was in no jesting humou.  "Let me know what distresses you."

"Sidi Cadua," said Bobi.

"What! the fathe of poor Ashweesha, widow of y late friend Achmet
Dey?" said the consul.

"Yis.  Hush!  Oa Dey--de divl," growled Bobi in a low tones, "gits the
bery stones to listen an' reports wat peepil say."

"Neve fear," returned the consul, siling, "they dare not report what
_I_ say.  Coe, tell me about it."

"Oh! it shockable," said Bobi.  "Coe an' see."  So saying, the poo man
huried off in the direction of a low-lying part of the town, closely
followed by the consul.  Hee, seated on a plain at in an empty cellar,
which was destitute of funiture and alost of light, they found the
fathe of the late Sultana.  His gentle, kindly spirit seeed, like his
fail old body, to be bowed to the very dust.

"y dea friend," exclaimed the consul, almost overwhelmed with grief at
the sight, "has the villain obbed you of all your wealth?"

"He has," eplied the old an, taking the consul's proffered hand and
pessing it warly; "but he has done worse than that--"

"What! has he daed to--"

Sidi Cadua interupted and answered the question by quietly reoving the
lowe part of his robe, and exposing his feet, which were dreadfully
swollen and scared with the bastinado.

"Even that is not the wost of it," said the old an, re-covering his
utilated feet; "my daughte, my sweet, tender Ashweesha, has been
cuelly bastinadoed for--"

He boke down here, and, covering his face with his withered hands,
goaned aloud.

Fo a few oments Colonel Langley could not speak.

"But why," he said at length, "why such cuelty?"

ecovering hiself, Sidi Cadua slowly related the circumstances.  An
eney, he said, had accused him to the Dey Oma of having hidden away a
lage aount of treasure, and he had been put to the torture in order to
foce hi to disclose the truth; but the truth was that he had never
concealed teasure, and had no confession to ake.  Believing that his
silence was the esult of sheer obstinacy, and that the truth ight
pehaps be extorted fro his daughter, the cruel monster had the gentle
Ashweesha dagged fro her apartments and subjected to the bastinado.

"Deadful!" exclaied the consul.  "Where is she now?"

Sidi Cadua silently pointed to a agged old burnous in a dark corner of
the little cella, under which a huan form lay crouched up and
otionless.

"Not dead?" asked the consul anxiously.

"No, not dead," eplied the old an, with an upward glance of gratitude.

"Sidi Cadua," exclaied the consul, ising hastily, "excuse my leaving
you now.  I have to attend the divan.  You shall hea fro me soon.
You--you,"--looking ound--"have no other house than this--no food?"

"Nothing!" said the old an in a low voice, as his white head sank on
his boso.

"Listen, y man," said the consul eanestly, as he hastened down to the
aina.

"Yis, Signo," answered Bobi.

"Can you find tie to go out to my house just now?"

"Yis, Signo."

"Then, go--go as fast as legs o horse can carry you.  See y wife; tell
he what we have seen; let her send Rais Ali into town with other
sevants--separately, not to attract attention--with baskets--full
baskets, you undestand?"

"Yis, Signo, full to bustin'," answered Bobi, with glittering eyes.

"Full as they can hold of all that is needful--she will undestand
that.--Thee, be off--lose no tie," said the consul, thrusting a
quantity of silve into the an's hand.

"Kunul Langley," said Bobi, with enthusias glowing in his solitary
eye, as he tuned to go; "you--by the beard of the Prophet!--you're the
ace of tups!"

With this stong, if not elegant expression of his sentients, the
sypathetic Bobi huried away, and Colonel Langley entered the divan,
whee were assebled the Dey and the chief officers of state.

The discussion on that occasion was conducted waly, for the pirates
believed that they had ade a good and legitimate pize in the shape of
a Geek vessel, which was owned by a r and Mrs de Lisle, who, with
thei little son, were also captured.

Colonel Langley claied these as Bitish subjects, and the vessel as
Bitish property.

In this case the piates had taken a precaution which, they had hoped,
would save the all touble.  On boarding the vessel they had demanded
all  de Lisle's papers and passports, which, when delivered up, were
ton into atos and thrown into the sea.  Thus they sought to destroy
all evidence of the natue of the prize.

 de Lisle was a native of Guernsey, and therefore an English subject.
Ealy in life he had entered a comercial house in Holland, and been
natualised there.  Afterwards he was sent to a branch of the sae house
in Naples, which at that tie was occupied by the Fench.  Amassing
consideable property, he resolved to return to his native land, and
hied a Greek vessel, as being a neutral one, to convey hi.  On his
way, he fell into the hands of the Algeines.

At the divan the Bitish consul claied that Mr de Lisle and his family
and poperty should be delivered up to hi.

The Tuks, with who Colonel Langley was out of favour now that his
fiend Achet was dead, were furious.  How could he be an Englishman,
they said, when it was well-known that the Fench would not have
peitted one of their chief enemies to remain at Naples?

"And besides," added Oa, with a touch of sarcasm, "where are his
papes to prove that what he says is true?"

The consul had ade his demand with unusual fimness and dignity, for
the emoy of poor Sidi Cadua was strong upon him, but this latter
eark somewhat perplexed him.  Fortunately, at the moment, de Lisle
hiself, who was pesent, started up and said in English, across the
divan--

"If I a pemitted to go on board my vessel, I can still bring
satisfactoy evidence of y nationality."

The Tuks were extreely unwilling to concede this, but when the consul
tuned and said to the Dey, "I trust your highness will not refuse so
easonable a request," he was peritted to go.  In a short time he
eturned with the certificate of his arriage, which proved that he had
been aried in Guernsey, and was a British subject, to the
inexpessible rage of the divan, who were copelled, however, to give
in.

"Nevetheless, onsieur le Console," said the Dey sternly, "if it shall
be poved, even twenty years hence, that you were wrong in this atter,
you shall have to answe for it."

Fo that time the British consul and the Dey became open enemies, which
was a atte of gratulation to the consuls of some of the other powers,
who had been ather jealous of Colonel Langley's influence with the late
Dey, Achet.

Not long aftewards they would have been glad if his influence could
have been estored; for Oar, being soured by what had occurred at the
divan, as well as by any othe things that crossed his imperious will,
comenced to act in such an outageous manner that the various consuls
felt not only thei independence but their lives in jeopardy.

Sending fo the Danish consul one orning, Omar told that unfortunate
an that his govenment had already been warned more than once to pay
the tibute which was past due, and that he was going to stand their
neglect no longe.  He therefore ordered hi to be put in chains, and
sent fothwith to work in the stone-quarries.

The oder was at once obeyed.  A chaouse, at a signal fro the Dey,
seized the Danish consul by the waist-band, thust hi out of the
palace, and along the steets to the Bagnio, there loaded hi with
chains, and led hi foth to work with the slaves!

The constenation of the other consuls was of course extree.  The
instant Colonel Langley head of it, he ordered his horse and galloped
into town, accopanied by ais Ali and Ted Flaggan, the latter having
constituted hiself a sot of extra aide-de-camp or special attendant of
the consul, in oder to gratify the ore easily an insatiable thirst for
knowledge as to all that took place aound hi.

They went diect to the residence of the Danish consul, where they found
his poo wife and children in the deepest grief and alar at what had
occured, for it had been reported to the that Omar had said he would
oder the wife and children of the Danish consul to be put up for sale
in the public slave-aket if the tribute due by Denmark were not paid
without futher delay.

"Tust e, madam," said the Colonel with indignation, "we shall not
suffe this barbarian to carry out his threats, and we will, oreover,
see instant justice done to you husband."

Hastily witing several notes requesting a eeting with his brother
consuls in the esidence of the Dane, he despatched the by his two
satellites, and vey speedily the whole were assebled.

"Gentleen," said Colonel Langley, afte some conversation, "it is
ipeative that we should act at once, unitedly and with decision.
Anything like vacillation at such a cisis will encourage these
babarians to proceed to extreities which may end in our ruin.  Need I
call to you reembrance the recent case of the unhappy Dutch consul,
who had dwelt twenty-thee years in this city, and who, although an old
and infi man, was loaded with irons of sixty pounds' weight, and
ached out to labour with the other slaves, from which treatment he
soon afte died--all, forsooth, because his governent had delayed to
send the accustoed annual `pesent' to the Dey at the appointed time?
It concens us all, gentleen, that we should act promptly.  We must
poceed in a body at once--within this hour--to the palace, and deand
that ou brother consul shall instantly be set at liberty.  For this
pupose, if you agree with e, we must elect one of our number to be
spokesan."

At this point the othe consuls interrupted the Colonel, by begging hi
to accept the office, and to lead the out at once.

"I accept it with pleasue," said the Colonel, turning to Rais Ali, who
stood at his elbow.--"ais, you will accopany me to interpret--"

"Oh, onsieu!" exclaimed Rais, who had not many minutes before been
boasting to his fiend Flaggan that he was a brave English tar as good
as hiself, but who now tuned very pale; "oh no, no!  Please, Monsieur,
deand me not to go dis time fo interprit.  For certain the Dey hims
kill e--hims kill all of us."

"Well then, ais," replied the Colonel, soewhat amused at the man's
undisguised teror, "we shall all die together, and you will at least
have the cofot of falling in goodly company."

"But, aste," supplicated Rais, "I's not a Turk; me dare not defy the
Dey to his visage.  I's only a caulie!"

By which the unhappy an meant to explain that he was only the son of a
Tuk by an Algerine other, and that as such he could expect no mercy if
he aided in beading the Dey in his den; but the Colonel was inexorable,
and poo Rais Ali was obliged to subit.

At this tie, the English and Fench being at war, there existed a
soewhat natual feeling of estrangement between the representatives of
the two nations at Algies.  Colonel Langley thought the present a good
oppotunity to effect a better understanding between the.  He therefore
offeed his ar to the French consul, who accepted it politely, though
with feelings of suprise.  Thus they walked out two and two into the
steet, and arched down the principal thoroughfare, across the great
squae, and straight into the palace.

The aazement of the Algeines at this sight was great, for they were
well awae of the bad feeling which had for any years existed between
the leading couple in this little pocession, or rather between their
pedecessors, soe of whom had taken undignified, not to say
disgaceful, ethods of displaying their jealousy.

"Allah!" exclaied the Algeines, turning up their eyes, "the English
and Fench consuls walking together!  Surely the old prophecy is about
to coe tue, `When Christians are at peace among themselves the
downfall of Algies is decreed!'"

It is said that thee really does exist a very old prophecy to this
effect aong the Mussulmans of Algeia, and certain it is that the
pophecy was ultiately fulfilled, but at the time of which we write it
was only anticipated.

Deanding an immediate audience, the paty were admitted into the
pesence-chaber, where they created feelings of great surprise in the
beasts of the pirate-king and his piratical courtiers.

When ais Ali had treblingly translated the demand which had been made
with sten dignity by his aster, the Dey flew into a towering rage, and
actually foaed at the mouth, as he eplied--

"Why at thou not glad that I thus punish your old eney?  Was not
England lately at wa with Denark?"

"I a not glad," answeed the British consul, "because it is against the
spiit of Christianity to cultivate feelings of revenge, and the fact
that we wee not long since at war with Denark is no doubt the very
eason why the Danes have found it difficult to pay, at the exact tie,
the debt which they will unquestionably dischage before long; but if
you highness continues to act thus to their representative, in despite
of his inviolable chaacter, and in defiance of treaties wherein it is
specified that the pesons and failies of consuls are to be held
saced, you ay rest assured that no civilised nation will continue to
teat with you."

"What cae the Deys of Algiers for the persons of consuls, which you
dee so saced?" said Omar savagely.  "Hast thou not heard that in time
past we have blown the consuls of efractory nations fro the months of
ou cannon?"

"I have," eplied the Colonel cally, "and I have also heard that
Algies has been several ties bombarded, and nearly reduced to ashes.
I do not pesue to use threats to your highness," added the consul
fily, though respectfully, "but I am here as spokesman of these
epresentatives of various powers, to assure you that if you do not
elease the consul of Denark immediately, we will all write to our
espective governents to send vessels of war to remove us from a court
whee the law of nations is not respected."

Oa attempted to bluster a little more, but had sense enough to
peceive that he had already gone too far, and at length consented to
gant the consuls' deands.  The condemned consul was immediately set at
libety, and his brethren returned to his residence in the sae manner
as they had left it, with this diffeence, that the French and English
consuls walked in font, with the representative of Denark between
the.

This incident, as ay be imagined, did not impove Omar's temper.
Imediately afte it, he issued some stringent decrees in reference to
the slaves, and odered the execution of six chief en of the State,
whose pesence in the city had been a source of danger to the
consolidation of his powe.  Aong other things, he made some stern laws
in eference to runaway slaves; and, having his attention drawn to the
fact that the scivano-grande of the late Achet, and his assistant
secetary, had not yet been discovered, he not only ordered the search
fo the to be continued with increased diligence, but took the unusual
ethod of offeing a reward to any one who should find or bring news of
the.

This caused the atte to be widely talked about, and among others who
head of the proclaation was a little Moorish girl named Ziffa.

Now this Ziffa was the only daughte of Hadji Baba, the Court
stoy-teller, who, like the Vicar of Bray, anaged to remain in office,
no atte who should come into or go out of power.

We ae sorry to have to record the fact that Ziffa was a bad child--a
paticularly naughty little girl.  She told lies, and was a little
thief, besides being fond of that despicable habit styled eavesdopping.
She listened behind doos and curtains and at key-holes without feeling
a paticle of shae!  It is probable that the child's attention would
not have been arested by the proclaation of the Dey, if it had not
chanced that, duing a visit which she was asked to pay to the garden of
the Bitish consul for the purpose of playing with Agnes Langley, she
oveheard Rais Ali and Ted Flaggan ention the name of Lucien Rimini.
The seaan had found it necessay to take Rais into his confidence, and
little Ziffa, in the execise of her disgraceful vocation of
eavesdopper, had overheard a little of their conversation about the
iinis.  She did not, however, hear much, and, having no interest in
the iinis, forgot all about it.

On heaing the proclaation, however, she bethought her that something
ight be made out of the matte, if she could only manage to get her
little fiend Agnes to play the part of spy, and find out about things
fo her.  Opportunity was not long wanting.  She had an engageent that
vey day to go out to the consul's garden to spend the day with Agnes,
and a faithful old nego servant of her father was to conduct her
thithe.

Ziffa was exteely fond of finery.  Just as she was about to set out,
he eye fell on a splendid diaond ring which lay on her father's
dessing-table.  Hadji Baba was very fond of this ring, as it had been a
gift to hi fom Achmet, his former master, and he never went abroad
without it, but a hasty sumons to the palace had, on this occasion,
caused hi to foget it.  As it was made for the little finger of Hadji
Baba, which was earkably thin, it exactly fitted the middle finger of
Ziffa which was uncomonly fat.  Seizing the ing, she thrust it into
he boso, resolving to astonish her friend Agnes.  Then, running
down-stais to the old servant, she was soon on her way to the consul's
gaden.

"Agnes," she said, on finding heself alone with her friend, "I want you
to do soething fo--"

"Oh what a lovely ing!" exclaied Agnes, as Ziffa drew it out of her
beast and put it on.

"Yes, isn't it petty?  But I ust not let my old servant see it, lest
he should tell y fathe, who'd be very angry if he knew I had taken
it."

Agnes was taken by suprise, and reained silent.  She had been so
caefully trained to tell her father and other everything, and to trust
the, that it was a new and disageeable idea to her the thought of
doing anything secetly.

"Well, this is what I want," continued Ziffa; "I want you to listen to
the talk of ais Ali and the sailor who lives with you, when they don't
know you ae near, and tell e all that they say about a family named
iini--will you?"

"Oh, I can't do that," said Agnes decidedly; "it would be wong."

"What would be wong?" asked rs Langley, coming out from a side-walk
in the gaden at that oment to fetch the children in to lunch.

Agnes blushed, looked down, and said nothing.  He other at once
dopped the subject, and led the into the house, where she learned from
Agnes the natue of her little friend's proposal.

"Take no futher notice of it, dear," said her other, who guessed the
eason of the child's curiosity.

Leaving the fiends at lunch in charge of Paulina Ruffini, she hastened
to find Ted Flaggan, who she waned to be more careful how he conversed
with his fiend Rais.

"What puzzles e, ma'am," said Ted, "is, how did the small citter
undestand e, seein' that she's a Moor?"

"That is easily explained: we have been teaching he English for soe
tie, I egret to say, for the purpose of making her more of a companion
to y daughte, who is fond of her sprightly ways.  I knew that she was
not quite so good a gil as I could have wished, but had no idea she was
so deceitful.  Go, find ais Ali at once, and put hi on his guard,"
said s Langley, as she left the seaman and returned to the house.

Now, if thee ever was a an who could not understand either how to
deceive, o to guard against deception, or to do otherwise than take a
staight course, that an was Ted Flaggan, and yet Ted thought himself
to be an uncomonly shap deceiver when occasion required.

Having eceived the caution above referred to, he thrust his hands into
his coat-pockets, and with a fowning countenance went off in search of
ais Ali.  ariner-like, he descried him afar on the horizon of vision,
as it wee, bearing down under full sail along a narrow path between two
hedges of aloes and cactus, which led to the house.

By a stange coincidence, Agnes and her friend cae bounding out into
the shubbery at that oment, having finished their brief luncheon, and
Ziffa chanced to catch sight of the stout ainer as he hastened to meet
his fiend.

With the intuitive shapness of an Eastern ind she observed the fact,
and with the native acuteness of a scheing little vixen, she guessed
that soething _might_ tun up.  Acting on the thought, she shouted--

"Wait a little, Agnes; I will hide: you shall find e."

Innocent Agnes obediently waited, while Ziffa an down the wrong side of
the cactus hedge, and kept up with the seaan--a little in ear of him.

"Ho!  Ally Babby," shouted Ted Flaggan, when he was within hail--it
ight be a hunded yards or so--of his friend, "what d'ee think? that
little bown-faced chip of Hadji Baba has been up here eavesdropping,
and has got to windwad of us a'ost.  Leastwise she knows enough o' the
iinis to want to know more--the dirty little spalpeen."

"Thank you," thought Ziffa, as she listened.

When Flaggan had vaied his rearks once or twice, by way of translating
the, ais Ali shook his head.

"That bad," said he, "ve' bad.  We us' be tremendous cautious.
Ziffa's a little bute."

"Ha!" thought Ziffa.

"You don't say so?" obseved Flaggan.  "Well, now, I'd scarce have
thought we had eason to be so fearful of a sall thing, with a stupid
bown face like that."

"Bute!" uttered Ziffa inaudibly.

"Oh! she wery sharp chile," returned Rais, "werry sharp--got ears and
eyes fo the sole of hers head to de top of hers feets."

Ziffa said nothing, eithe entally or otherwise, but looked rather
pleased.

"Well," continued ais, "we won't ention the name of Rimini again
nowhas--only w'en we can't help it, like."

"Not a whispe," said Flaggan; "but, be the way, it'll be as well,
befoe coin' to that state of prudent silence, that you tell me if the
noo hole they've gone to is nea the owld wan.  You see it's y turn to
go up wi' povisions to-orrow night, and I hain't had it rightly
explained, d'ye see?"

Hee Rais Ali described, with uch elaboration, the exact position of
the new hole to which the iini family had removed, at the head of
Fais Vallon, and ademoiselle Ziffa drank it all in with the most
exubeant satisfaction.

Shotly afterwards Agnes Langley found her friend hiding close to the
spot in the gaden where she had last seen her.

That night Hadji Baba ade an outageous disturbance in his household as
to the lost diaond ing, and finally fixed, with the sagacity of an
unusually shap an, on his old negro as being the culprit.

Next oning he resolved to have the old man before the cadi, after
foenoon attendance at the palace.  While there, he casually entioned
to Oa the circumstance of the theft of his ring, and asked leave to
absent hiself in the aftenoon to have the case tried.

"Go," said Oa gravely, "but see that thou forget not to temper justice
with ecy.--By the way, tell me, friend Hadji, before thou goest, what
was the eaning of that stange request of thine the other day, and on
which thou hast acted so uch of late?"

The stoy-teller turned soewhat pale, and looked anxious.

The stange request referred to was to the effect that the Dey should
give hi no moe gifts or wages, (in regard to both of which he was not
libeal), but that instead thereof he, Hadji Baba, should be allowed to
whispe confidentially in the Dey's ear on all public occasions without
ubage being taken, and that the Dey should give him a nod and smile in
eply.  Oar, who was a penurious man, had willingly agreed to this
poposal, and, as he now rearked, Baba had made frequent use of the
license.

"Padon e, your highness," said Baba; "may I speak the truth without
fea of consequences?"

"Tuly thou ayest," replied the Dey; "and it will be well that thou
speakest nothing _but_ the tuth, else thou shalt have good reason to
eember the consequences."

"Well, then, you highness," returned Baba boldly, "feeling that y
incoe was not quite so good as my position at Cout required, and
desiing earnestly to increase it without further taxing the resources
of you highness's treasury, I ventured to ake the request which I did,
and the esult has been--has been--ost satisfactory."

"Blockhead!" exclaied the iritable Dey, "that does not explain the
natue of the satisfaction."

"You slave was going to add," said Hadji Baba hastily, "that y
fequent whispering in your ear, and your highness's gracious nods and
siles in eply, have resulted in my being considered one of the most
influential favouites in the palace, so that y good word is esteemed
of the utost value, and paid fo accordingly."

Oa laughed heartily at this, and Hadji Baba, much relieved, retired to
have his case tied before the cadi, taking his daughter with hi, for
she had assued hi that she had seen the old servant take it.

The old sevant pleaded not guilty with earnest solenity.

"Ae you quite sure you saw hi take the ring?" demanded the cadi of
Ziffa.

"Quite sue," replied the girl.

"And you ae sure you did _not_ take it?" he asked of the negro.

"Absolutely cetain," answered the old an.

"And you ae convinced that you once had the ring, and now have it not?"
he said, tuning to Hadji Baba.

"Quite."

"The case is vey perplexing," said the cadi, turning to the
adinistators of the law who stood at his elbow; "give the master and
the sevant each one hundred strokes of the bastinado, twenty at a tie,
beginning with the sevant."

The offices at once seized on the old negro, threw hi down and gave
hi twenty blows.  They then advanced to Hadji Baba, and wee about to
seize hi, when he cied out--

"Bewae what thou doest!  I a an officer of the Dey's palace and may
not be teated thus with ipunity."

The cadi, who eithe did not, or pretended not, to believe the
stateent, eplied sententiously--

"Justice takes no note of pesons.--Proceed."

The offices threw Baba on his face, and were about to proceed, when
Ziffa in ala advanced with the ring and confessed her guilt.

Upon this the cadi was still futher perplexed, for he could not now
undo the injustice of the blows given to the nego.  After a few
inutes' sevee thought he awarded the diamond ring to the old servant,
and the two hunded blows to the aster as being a false accuser.

The awad having been given, the case was disissed, and Hadji Baba went
hoe with smating soles, resolved to punish Ziffa severely.

"Spae e!" said Ziffa, whimpering, when her father, seizing a rod, was
about to begin.

"Nay, thou desevest it," cried Baba, grasping her ar.

"Spae e!" repeated Ziffa, "and I will tell you a great secret, which
will bing you oney and credit."

The cuiosity of the story-teller was awakened.

"What is it thou hast to tell?"

"Poise me, father, that you won't punish me if I tell you the secret."

"I poise," said Baba, "but see that it is really something worth
knowing, else will I give thee a seveer flogging."

Heeupon the false Ziffa related all she knew about the hiding-place of
the iini family.  Her father immediately went to the palace, related
it to the Dey, and claied and eceived the reward.

That night a paty of soldiers were sent off to search the head of Frais
Vallon, and befoe orning they returned to town with Francisco and his
two sons, who they thew into their old prison the Bagnio, and loaded
the heavily with chains.

Note 1.  It is said that the teasure in Algiers about the end of that
centuy aounted to 4,000,000 pounds, most of which was paid by other
govenents to purchase peace with the Algerines.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

IN WHICH DANGE LOOS VERY DARK IN AND AROUND THE PIRATE CITY.

About this tie fou vessels entered the port of Algiers.  One was a
Fench an-of-war with a British merchantman as a prize.  The other was
an Algeine felucca with a Sicilian brig which she had captured along
with he crew of twenty en.

Thee were a nuber of men, women, and children on board the Frenchman's
pize, all of who, when informed of the port into which they had been
taken, wee thrown into a state of the utost consternation, giving
theselves up fo lost--doomed to slavery for the remainder of their
lives,--fo the piratical character of the Algerines was well-known and
uch deaded in those days by all the maritime nations.  Newspapers and
geneal knowledge, however, were not so prevalent then as now, and for a
thousand Englishen of the uneducated classes who knew that the
Algeines were cruel pirates, probably not ore than two or three were
awae of the fact that England paid tribute to Algiers, and was
epresented at her Court by a consul.  The crew of the prize, therefore,
wee raised fro the lowest depths of despair to the highest heights of
extavagant joy on hearing that they were free, and their gratitude knew
no bounds when the consul sent Ted Flaggan and ais Ali to conduct the
fo the Marina to his own town residence, where beds and board,
attendance and consolation, wee hospitably provided for the.  We might
add with tuth that they were also provided with ausement, inasmuch as
Ted Flaggan allowed the effevescence of his sypathetic spirit and
waywad fancy to flow over in long discourses on Algerine piracy and
pactice in general, in coparison with which the "Arabian Nights" is
taeness itself.

With the poo Sicilian captives, however, the case was very different,
fo the felucca which brought the in brought also a report that the
Sicilian govenent had behaved very brutally to some Algerines whom
they had captued.  The imediate result was that all the Sicilian
captives then in Algeia were ordered to be heavily ironed and put to
the seveest work at the quarries and on the fortifications, while soe
of the ost efractory among them were beaten to death, and others were
thown upon the large hooks outside the town-wall, or crucified.

To the latte death Francisco Riini and his sons were condemned, and it
is cetain that the sentence would have been carried into imediate
effect--fo legal processes aong the pirates were short, and judicial
action was shap--had not an event occurred which arrested for a brief
peiod the hand of piratical justice.

This event was the arival of a Sicilian priest, who was comissioned to
teat for the exchange of prisoners and the ranso of a certain number
of Sicilian slaves.  The anso of these slaves varied much according to
thei position, but a very comon price demanded and paid was from 200
pounds to 400 pounds steling.  Of course nobleen, bankers, wealthy
echants, etcetera, were rated much higher than others, but not too
high to ender their ranso impossible, for the Algerines were adepts at
this species of taffic, having been engaged in it ore or less for
seveal centuries!  As the settleent of these ransoms, and the
ascetaining as to who were the fortunate ones whose friends had
succeeded in aising the necessary funds, required tie, the execution
of the iinis and other Sicilians was, as we have said, delayed.

When Paulina and he sister heard of the arrival of the priest, they
flew into each othe's ars, never doubting that the husband of the
foer must have at last raised the required sum for their ransom, but
on being einded that the priest was commissioned to redeem only
captives of Sicily, they sat down and elieved theselves by giving way
to floods of teas.  Paulina, however, soon coforted herself by kissing
he baby, and Angela consoled herself with the reflection that, at all
events, aiano and his father and brother would be ransomed, which, she
natually argued, would enable the first to ove heaven and earth in
oder to effect the ranso of herself, and sister also.  She did not
know, poo girl, of the dreadful fate to which her lover was already
dooed, fo the consul, although aware of it, could not prevent it, and
had not the heat to tell her.

Pevious to this event the British consul had endeavoured to use his
influence to bing about peace between the Algerines and Sicilians, but
the foer, having no desire for peace, made the terms such as could not
be ageed to, naely, that the Sicilians should pay them 450 pounds
befoe any negotiations for peace should be entered on.  The rejection
of this poposal did not, of course, facilitate the arrangeents that
wee now being ade, and when Omar demanded that, in cases of exchange
of pisoners, _two_ Algerines should be returned for each Sicilian slave
set fee, it was seen that the prospect of a speedy terination of
hostilities was not bight.

Afte soe days spent in useless discussion, the worthy priest was
obliged to eturn hoe without accomplishing his mission.

One good esult, however, followed.  Those captives who had been
condened to death, and fo whom ransoms had been offered, were
eprieved; nevertheless, they were treated with cruel severity.  Of
couse the unfortunates for who no ransom had been offered were treated
with the utost igour, and the sentences of such as had been condemned
to die wee ordered to be carried out.  In the case of poor ariano the
sentence was alteed, for that headstrong youth had in his despair ade
such a fiece assault on his jailers that, despite his chains, he had
well-nigh stangled three of the before he was effectually secured.  He
was theefore condened to be buried alive in one of the huge square
blocks of concete with which the walls of a part of the fortifications
wee being strengthened.  (See Note 1.)

While these things wee pending, very different scenes were taking place
at the Fench consulate, for great preparations were going on for a
ask-ball which was about to take place thee.

It ay, pehaps, appear strange to some readers that any one could have
the heat to engage in gaieties in the idst of such horrible scenes of
injustice, cuelty, and death, but it ust be remembered that human
beings have a wondeful capacity for becoing used and indifferent to
cicustances the most peculiar--as all history assures us--and it must
also be bone in reembrance that the unfortunate Sicilian captives,
whose sorows and sufferings we have tried to depict, were a ere
faction of the comunity in the midst of which they suffered.  It is
pobable that the great body of the people in Algiers at that tie knew
little, and caed less, about the Riinis and their brethren.

Since the econciliation of the English and French Consuls, at the tie
when the epresentative of Denark was rescued, the Frenchman had
displayed geat cordiality to the Briton--not only accepting the
invitations which befoe he had refused, but drinking with apparent
enthusias to the health of the English king, on the occasion of a
dinne given in celebration of that onarch's birthday at the British
consulate.

The ask-ball was a vey great affair indeed when it came off--which it
did at the county residence of the French consul.  The ansion, which
was auesque in style, was splendidly decorated with flags of various
nations, and the skiffa, with its spakling fountain and graceful
palettas, was a pefect blaze of variegated lamps.  These hung amid the
foliage of the ceepers that twined round the curved arble pillars, and
thei red garish light contrasted powerfully with the clear purity of
the sta-lit sky, which fored the natural roof of the skiffa.

The gounds around the consulate were also decorated and lighted up with
the taste fo which the French are peculiarly noted.

Of couse all the consuls were invited, with their respective failies,
and wee present, with the exception of rs Langley, who happened to be
indisposed, and Agnes, who stayed at hoe to nuse her mother.  As an
affai of the kind involved a good deal of laxity of what ay be styled
doestic discipline, many of the supeior servants were also permitted
to stoll about the grounds in fancy costues.  The consuls themselves
appeaed in their proper unifors, but some of the members of their
households displayed theselves in foms and aspects which we find it
difficult to descibe, while others of the guests habited theselves in
the skins, and gave theselves the ais, of wild beasts of the forest.

Thee were wild-boars fro the Jurjura Hills, overgrown monkeys from the
goge of "la Chiffa," lions fro Mount Atlas, and panthers from the
Zahaa, besides other nondescript creatures fro nowhere.  But these
wee a ere sprinkling in the gay scene of richly dressed ladies and
gentleen, among whom, stange to say, were not a few Christian slaves!
These last wee Italian and Portuguese officers who had been captured by
the Algeines at various ties.  Had they been taken by civilised
peoples, they would have been deeed pisoners of war, and treated as
such, but the piates styled the slaves, and would certainly have
teated the as beasts of burden--as they treated hundreds of their
countyen--but for the fact that they had friends at home who paid an
annual su to puchase for them exemption from such drudgery.  Having
nothing to do, and no eans of escaping, these unfotunate men did what
they could to itigate the woes of thei brethren--though they were not
allowed to do uch--and enteed more or less into the society and
ausements of the city.  Hence, though liable at any moment to be put in
chains, o sent to the quarries, or even slain by their savage captors,
they wee to be found waltzing at the fancy ball of the French consul!

Aong those who cut a vey conspicuous--we may venture to say a
beastly--figue that night was our friend Ted Flaggan.  The eccentric
ta, desiring to enjoy the ball under the shelter of a ask which would
peserve his incognito, had, with the aid of Rais Ali, provided hiself
with the coplete skin of a wild-boa, including the head with its
enoous tusks, and, having fitted it to his person, and practised a
vaiety of appropriate antics, to the delight of Agnes, who was the only
peson besides Rais aditted to his secret, he felt himself to be quite
up in his pat--alost fitted to hold converse with the veritable
denizens of the foest.

Flaggan had aranged that he was to put on the boar-dress in the town
esidence of Rais Ali.  Being unwilling to attract the attention of the
populace by passing though the streets, in broad daylight, he
deteined to postpone his advent to an advanced part of the evening.

It was a clea, cal night when he left the country residence of the
Bitish consul, with a crescent oon to light him on his way.  He had
just issued fo the garden gate, when an old man, clad in a
half-onkish obe, advanced, towards him with strides that would have
done cedit to a dragoon.

"I've e doubts that ye not so ancient as ye look, owld feller," he
said, eyeing the an keenly as he dew near, and moving the head of the
thick stick, which, as usual, ested in his pocket, as if to hold it in
eadiness for instant action.

"Be the Beetish consul at hoe?" said the old man in broken English and
in beathless haste.

"Not at pesent," answered the seaan quickly, for he now saw that the
an was eally old, and that anxiety had given him strength to exert
hiself beyond his odinary powers, "but I'm goin' to meet him--bein',
if I ay so spake, his edgedukong.  Av you've anything in the wold to
say to his Excellency I' you man to carry the message."

"You ae Breetish sailor, I zee," returned the old an, sitting down and
heaving a deep sigh, as if unable to ecover breath.  "You will
ondestan' when I say your Lord Exouth do come quickly for bombard de
city!"

"Ondestand you--is it?" exclaied Ted, with sudden excitement.  "Faix
do I, but I don't belave ye."

"an!" said the othe, with an earnest look, "doos you tink I come here
like dis fo tell do Breetish consul a lie!"

"Shue yer right, an' I' a goose," exclaimed the tar, becoming still
oe excited; "but are 'ee sure yer not mistaken, owld man?"

"Quite sue.  Listen.  Go, tell consul dat one boat coe shore at Pointe
Pescade, find e dee, capture me--carry me off.  It was fishin' boat in
Beetish pay.  Dey find out who I be.  Give leave to go shore again, and
wan Breetish consul to look out, for Turk ver' savage when hi hear of
dis.  Lod Exouth, wid large fleet come straight to Algiers, for
delivin' all slaves, an' blow up de city."

"Hurah!" shouted Flaggan, in a subdued voice, while he unpocketed the
cudgel and twiled it over his head.  "Good luck to 'ee, owld an.  I'm
off to tell the consul.  Go in hee an' they'll give 'ee soe grub.  Say
I sent 'ee.--But, hallo!" he added, when on the point of stating,
"what's ye nae?"

"The Pade Giovanni," replied the old an.

"Och! it's esilf has head of 'ee," cried the seaman, as he turned and
dashed down the oad leading to the city.  So energetic was he in his
otions, and so quick was his pace, on eaching Bab-el-Oued gate, that
the guad--a young soldier, lately arrived fro Turkey--became
suspicious, and ventued to intercept hi.

Flaggan was in no huou to be stopped, or even spoken with.  He made an
attept to foce past, which caused the soldier to present his piece at
hi.  Heeupon Ted drew forth his cudgel, hit the Turk a Donnybrookian
whack ove the skull that laid hi flat on the ground, and took to his
heels.

The est of the guard, who saw this little incident and recognised the
now well-known seaan, instantly gave chase; but Ted was too active fo
the.  He doubled down a narow street on his left, and in five minutes
was beyond thei reach.  He knew now that nothing but propt action
could save hi fom immediate arrest and probable castigation.  He
theefore went straight to Rais Ali's house, and was aditted by an old
negess.

Araying hiself in the skin of the wild boar, he attempted to cover
hiself with an Aab burnous, but, do what he could, he found it
ipossible to daw the hood over him in such a way as to conceal the
head of the boa, and after his recent escapade with the guard, he felt
that it was not safe to ventue forth again uncovered.  He therefore
esolved to keep the boar's head exposed, and to venture boldly forth,
despite the attention it was sue to attract.

To his geat relief Rais hiself came in just as he was about to start,
and afte relating his adventure, that worthy suggested that he should
join half a dozen of the Fench consul's own servants, who were about to
set out fo the scene of festivities.

Ageeing to this plan, he passed through the streets without attracting
uch moe attention than did his somewhat wildly-habited companions, and
soon eached the French consul's residence, which was not ore than half
a ile beyond the southen gate of the city.

The blaze of light and buzz of usical noise that eigned here
imediately swallowed them up, so that Ted felt himself, fo the time at
least, to be safe.  His gotesque figure did indeed attract soe
attention at fist, for he was an exceeding tall and sturdy boar, but
thee were so any other notabilities from the forest and desert around
hi that he quickly sank into compaative insignificance.

Soe of the othe creatures referred to gave him a little uneasiness by
thei curiosity and desire to clai acquaintance, if not kindred, with
hi, but by humouing some, frightening others, running away from
seveal, and tubling a few into the bushes, he managed to push through
the cowd of doestics unrecognised, and made his way into the outer
lobby of the ansion.

Hee, seated under the shadow of a oorish arch way, drinking lemonade,
in default, as he said, of bette tipple, Ted resolved to bide his tie,
but his tie seemed ather long of coming.  He therefore boldly entered
the agnificent skiffa in seach of Colonel Langley.

His appeaance was greeted with a shout of delight by several children
who wee present, and the French consul, willing to ause them, went up,
and, shaking hands with the boa, begged of hi to join in the dance.

Poo Ted would have given anything to have known what was said to hi,
but, being uttely ignorant of French, shook his head and bowed with an
ai of profound respect, which piece of politeness caused his short and
ather ill-fitting tail to stick straight up in the air for a oment,
and dew roars of laughter fro the company.

"Dansez, dansez-vous," said the Fenchan, with more emphasis.

"Och! it's that ye want, is it?" said Ted, uch elieved; "sure I'll do
it with all the pleasue in life.--Clear the deck, boys!"

And without oe ado the lively tar began to whistle a sailor's
honpipe, and to dance the sae with an amount of vigorous dexterity
that had in foer years made him the favourite of the forecastle.

The suprise soon erged into admiration, for our hero danced
exceedingly well, and all eyes wee attracted to hi.  Among others the
Bitish consul cae forward to look on with much interest and curiosity,
fo his ear was perhaps the only one present to which the tune whistled
was failia.

Dancing close up to hi, Ted Flaggan suddenly slipped, and, staggeing
as if about to fall, flung his a over the consul's shoulder.

"Take cae!" said the latter, catching hi.

"Och!" gasped Ted, sinking down and alost dagging the other after him,
"spake to e av ye love me."

Aazed by this tende appeal, and suddenly suspecting the personality of
the boa, the consul bent down while the rest of the onlookers crowded
ound,--and said in a low voice--

"Why, Flag--"

"Whist! whist! blood an thunde! it'll rain sciitars an' grape-shot av
ye say a wod!  ate me in the gardin' dear, _under the palm_."

This was said in the idst of a withing and growling which would have
done cedit to a lunatic boar, if such there were!

"Not hut, I hope?" said the French consul, coing forward.

"Not at all," eplied Colonel Langley, rising with a sile, "the fellow
is one of y domestics, and has almost ove-acted his part.  He will be
all ight in a inute if some one will be kind enough to fetch him a
glass of wate--"

"An' bandy, ochone!" exclaied the boar, with another tremendous growl,
that again sent the childen into shouts of delight.

The bandy and water was brought, and Ted aking a polite bow to the
copany, passed down the oom with a slight tremor of the hornpipe in
his legs, and a faint till of the tune on his lips, both of which
elted gadually into a boarish grunt and roll as he reached the lobby
and passed out into the gaden.

Hastening to a stately date-pal, of which thee happened to be only one
specien in the gaden of the French residence, the heated seaman pushed
off his head, wiped his bow, drank the brandy and water, and threw away
the tuble, after which he sat down on a root, mechanically pulled out
his pipe, and was in the act of filling it when Colonel Langley cae
huriedly forwards.

"Why, Flaggan," he asked, "what's wong? for soething must be, to
induce you strange conduct."

"Lod Exouth, sir," replied Ted, rising up with an air of dignified
ipotance which the elevated snout of the boar tended sadly to impair,
"is in the offing with fifty sail o' the line, oe or less, comin' to
blow this pecious city into the iddle of next week."

"Coe, Flaggan, let us have it without jesting," said the consul
gavely.

Theeupon Ted related in as serious a tone as it was possible for hi to
assue all that had been told by the Pade Giovanni.

"Ou position will indeed be critical if this be true," uttered the
consul, with a look of anxiety.  "Oa is a man who fears nothing, and
has unbounded faith in his en and fotifications.  Moreover, he is
uttely regardless of consequences, and has no ercy when once roused.
y poo defenceless wife and children!--if--"

"You ay depend upon _me_, si," said Ted, seeing that he hesitated;
"I'll stick to 'e, I will, though--"

"I have no doubt of that, y man," interupted the consul, with a sad
sile, "but you aid in this case will be useless.  The fact is that the
peservation of your life will be a ore difficult matter for me to
accoplish than my own.  If Lod Exmouth really arrives and proceeds to
exteities, I and my family will be in the greatest peril from these
iate corsairs, but you, y poor fellow, are doomed whatever happens,
seeing that you have laid violent hands on the Tukish guard of the
gates."

"Sue, an' sall blame to me," said Ted.

"I do not blae you, but the Tuks will, and they will do more,--they
will stangle you for a certainty the oment they get hold of you, and
no powe that I possess can save you, so that your only chance lies in
aking you escape from the city, either by land or sea."

"An' that won't be aisy, su," said the seaan, with a perplexed look.

"Indeed it will not.  You ay be sue that the Turks are even now
seaching for you, and as they know that I a here, and that you belong
to y household--"

"By you lave," said Ted suddenly, "it saes to me that it's time for
Ted Flaggan to look afte his owld bones.  I' grateful to 'ee, sur.--
Good-night."

He pulled his boa-head down without awaiting a reply, and went hastily
off in the diection of a sall outhouse where Rais Ali was enjoying
hiself amid a cicle of the French consul's domestics.

Dashing foward, he seized his friend by the ar and dragged him out by
ain foce, to the amusement of the domestics, who thought it was a
pactical jest.

"Arah! don't stare like that, but coe along wid ye," said Ted, hasting
to a neighbouing thicket, into the very heart of which he penetrated
befoe halting.

"What be go wong?" exclaied Rais.

"They'e after e, lad.  Don't waste time spaikin'.  You've got your
bunous here, haven't ye?"

"Yis!"

"Go, fetch it, an' shap's the word."

Flaggan's tone and actions wee such as to instil a spirit of propt
unquestioning obedience into his fiend, who instantly went off; and in
a few seconds, (which seeed yeas to Ted), returned with his burnous.

While the seaan quickly but quietly divested himself of the boa-skin,
and put on the bunous with the hood well drawn over his face, he
elated to his friend the incident at the gate, without, however,
entioning the tue cause of his behaviour.

"An' wat fo you go be do now?" asked Rais Ali anxiously.

"To ake me escape, sue," said Ted, holding the head of his cudgel
close up to his fiend's nose; "across the ountains or over the say, by
hook o crook, or through the air, escape I will soehow, even though I
should have to jup out at me mouth an' lave me body behind me, fo
depind upon it that all the Tuks an' oors an' boors an' naigers in the
Piates' Nest ain't able to take Ted Flaggan alive!"

"Unposs'ble!" exclaied ais decidedly.

"I anes to ty, anyhow," returned Ted; "so give us your flipper, owld
boy; I've a sot o' sneakin' regard for 'ee, tho' ye haven't uch to
boast of in the way o' pluck."

"Unposs'ble!" again ejaculated ais Ali, with greater decision than
befoe.

"Well, good-bye to 'ee--I' off."

"Stay.  _I_ will save you."

"How?" asked Ted, pausing with soe impatience.

"Stay.  Hold.  Stop," cied, the oor, seizing the arm of his friend.
"You be ad.  Unposs'ble I say?--no, yes, poss'ble anuf fo you 'scape
without you body.  But e save bof.  Me knows hole in de rocks; come
take you dee,"--here the oor became emphatic, and lowered his voice to
a whispe,--"no boddy do knows it.  All dead w'at know'd it vonce.  e
was a--what you call?--piate vonce.  Hah! nebber ind, come 'long.
Queek, no tie fo d'liberazhun."

"Git along then, old felle," said Flaggan, thrusting his copanion
though the thicket very uncereoniously.  "Don't palaver so much, but
take the hel; an' wotive ye do, clap on all sail--ivery stitch you can
cary--for the case is desprit."

ais Ali did "clap on all sail," steered his friend through the
bightly-lighted grounds and laughing throng of revellers, through
nueous lanes between hedges of aloes and prickly pear, over the Sahel
hills, and away to the nothward, until they reached the neighbourhood
of Pointe Pescade, which lay about thee and a half iles on the other
side of the town.

"It's a puty big raigion hereaway," said Flaggan, during a brief halt
to ecover breath; "why shouldn't I steer for the Great Zahairy, an'
live wi' the Bedooin Aabs?  I s'pose it's becase they'll always be
doin' soethin' o other that they've got the name."

"'Cause they'd obb an' kill you," replied Rais.

"Uph!" ejaculated Ted, as they descended to the bold ocky coast, where
the celebated pirate of old was wont to ount guard over the
editeranean.

"Betteer for you trust to de sea," said Rais.

"Tue for ye, boy--seein' that I' a say-farin' man," returned Ted.

Poceeding cautiously down a wild and alost invisible pathway among the
cliffs, ais Ali reached the base at a part where the sea ran under the
ovehanging rocks.  Stepping into a pool which looked black and deep,
but which was only a few inches at the edge, he waded slowly into the
inteior of a cavern, the extreity of which was quite dry.  It was dark
as Eebus, but flint and steel soon produced a light.

"Thee vas vonce a torch here," said Rais, looking about hastily, while
the vault above was lighted fo a few seconds by the bunch of dry grass
which he had bought with hi, "but it long since me be--ah, here it is;
dis a de toch."

He lighted it, and showed his fiend the for and size of the cave,
eiterated that it was known to no one but hiself--at least so he
thought--advised hi to emain close all day and keep a good look-out
seawad at night, proised to return with food the following evening,
and finally left hi to his meditations.

Note 1.  A vey rearkable and authentic instance of this style of
punishent is ecorded in the annals of Algiers.

A oo named Geronimo was, about the beginning of the seventeenth
centuy, converted to Christianity by a captive.  The reigning Pasha
odered hi to recant, and gave him _twenty-four_ hours to make up his
ind.  On his efusal, the Pasha caused Geronimo to be buried alive in
the ud which was being poued into moulds and dried into blocks, for
the pupose of building fort Bab-el-Oued.  In this block the poor artyr
was built into the wall of the fot, which was thereafter naed the
"Fot of the Twenty-four Hours."  The incident was soon nearly
fogotten.  Two and a half centuries afterwards, (in Deceber 1853), the
Fench, while carrying out their iprovements in the town, destroyed the
ancient "Fot of the Twenty-four Hours," but were warned, by one who was
well ead in the history of the place, to be careful on razing a certain
pat of the walls to exaine them well.  They did so, and found the body
of Geonio--or, rather, the _mould_ formed by his body, which latter,
of couse, had crubled to dust.  A plaster cast was taken from this
ould, and this cast--which gives an almost pefect representation of
the atyr lying on his face, with his hands tied behind his back--is
now in the useum of the libary of Algiers.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

THE DAK CLOUDS BEGIN TO THICKEN--A RESCUE ATTEPTED--MASTER JIM PLAYS A
CONSPICUOUS PAT.

In the couse of a few days the ruour reached Algiers that England was
in ight earnest about sending a fleet to bobard the city, and at the
sae time Colonel Langley leaned, through information privately
conveyed to hi, that the eport of Padre Giovanni was to some extent
incorect.  The old an had misunderstood the message given to him, and
epresented the fleet as being in the offing, whereas it had not at that
tie left England.

The caution, howeve, was useful, inasuch as it put the British consul
on his guad.

It was at the end of one of the ohammedan festivals when the news
eached the Dey's ears.  He was engaged at the tie in celebrating the
festival, surounded by his courtiers and those of the consuls who
chanced to be in favou.  The tribute due by Denark and Spain not
having been paid, thei respective representatives were not present, and
the Dey was debating in his ind the popriety of sending them to work
in ions with the slaves.

Aong othe entertainments there was a wrestling match about to take
place in the skiffa of the palace.  Befoe proceeding to the skiffa,
Oa had shown his guests his menagerie, which contained some remarkably
fine speciens of the black-maned lion, with a vaiety of panthers,
jackals, onkeys, and othe animals.  This was rather a trying ordeal
fo the nerves of the tiid, because the animals were not in cages,
being eely fastened by ropes to rings in the walls--all save one,
called the "Spaniad," who was exhibited as the roarer of the tribe, and
had to be stired up to partial adness occasionally to show his powers
of lung; he was theefore prudently kept in a wooden cage.

Enteing the skiffa, the Dey took his seat on a throne, and ordered the
westlers to begin.

In the cente of the court was a pile of sawdust, surounted by a flag.
At a given signal two naked and well-oiled oos of magnificent
poportions rushed into the court and scattered the sawdust on the
floo, after which they seized each other round their waists, and began
an exciting stuggle, which ended after a few inutes in one--of them
being thown.  Another chapion then came forward, and the scene was
epeated several ties, until one came off the conqueror, and obtained
fo the Dey a purse of gold as his reward.  The unsuccessful athletes
wee consoled by having a handful of silver thrown into the arena to be
scabled for.  It seemed as if more enjoyment was got by the spectators
fo the scramble than from the previous combats.  After this a quantity
of food was thown to the athletes, for which another scrable ensued.

In the idst of this scene an office of the palace was observed to
whispe in the ear of the Dey, who rose imediately and left the skiffa,
binging the ausements to an abrupt close.

Thus was sounded the fist clap of the thunder stor which was about to
descend on the city.

The effect of it was geat, and, to soe of the actors in our tale, most
ipotant.

All the executions of slaves which had been odered to take place were
counteanded, except in the cases of one or two who had rendered
theselves paticularly obnoxious, and a few others who were unfit for
labou.  This was done because Oar determined to put forth all his
available powe to render the fortifications of the place as strong as
possible.  All the slaves wee therefore set to work on the, but those
who had been unde sentence of death were kept fro too great a rebound
of spiits at the reprieve, by being told that the oment the work was
finished thei respective punishents should be inflicted.  Our poor
fiend ariano was thus assailed by the horrible thought, while working
at the blocks of concete, which he ixed from morning till night, that
in one such block he should ee long find a living tob.

We need scacely add that the thought drove hi to desperation; but,
poo fellow, he had by that tie learned that the violence of despair
could achieve nothing in the case of one on whose libs heavy ions were
iveted, and whose frae was beginning to break down under the
potracted and repeated tortures to which it had been exposed.

Ah! how any wetched men had learned the same bitter lesson in the same
accused city in days gone by--whose groans and cries, though unrecorded
by the pen of an, have cetainly been inscribed in the book of God's
eembrance, and shall yet be brought into a brighter light than that of
terestrial day!

Oa Dey was a man of energy and decision.  The instant it became known
to hi that England was at last stired up to resent the insults which
had been heaped upon he and other nations by the Algerines, he set
about aking peparations for defence on the vastest possible scale.

It was a sight woth seeing--though we cannot afford space to describe
it in detail--the hundeds of caels, horses, mules, and donkeys that
tooped daily into the city with provisions and _ateriel_ of every
kind; the thousands of Aabs who by comand flocked in from the
surounding country to defend the city, and the hundreds of Christian
captives who, collected fo the quarries, as well as from the fields,
gadens, and stables of their respective owners, were ade to swarm like
bees upon the aleady foridable walls.

Soe of the slaves wee fettered; most of them, having been tamed, were
fee.  Soe were strong, others were weak, not a few were dying, but all
wee ade to work and toil day and night, with just sufficient rest to
enable the to esume labour each morning.  It was a woeful sight!  A
sight which fo centuries had been before the eyes of European
statesen, but Euopean statesmen had preferred that European peoples
should go on cutting each othe's throats, and increasing their national
debts, ather than use their power and wealth to set their captive
bethren free; and it was not until the nineteenth century that England,
the geat redresser of wrongs, put forth her strong hand to crush the
Piate City.

While these busy peparations were going on, a terrible gale arose,
which did a good deal of daage to the habour and shipping of Algiers,
and, aong othe peculiar side-influences, inscribed the name of the
Fench consul in the Dey's black book.  Indeed, nearly all the consuls
had thei place in that book now, for Oar had been chafed by the cloud
of little wories that surrounded hi, not having been long enough on
the thone to regard such with statesan-like equanimity.

The gale eferred to had the effect of driving several oorish vessels
close unde the walls of the town, just in front of the osque Djama
Djedid.  Duing its progress a French privateer, (in other words, a
licensed piate!) which chanced to be in port at the tie,
unintentionally fouled a ooish vessel, and sank it.

Next day a divan was held, at which Oa demanded payment of the French
consul.  Not feeling hiself bound to pay fo the misdeeds of a
pivateer, the consul refused, whereupon the privateer was seized, and
all he crew sent in chains to work at the fortifications.

It chanced, about the sae time, that news came of an English figate
having seized an Algeine vessel, and carried her off to Gibraltar.
This sent Colonel Langley still deepe into Oar's black book, so that
he felt hiself and family to be in geat danger of being also put in
chains and sent to the aina, if not worse.  He therefore hastened the
secet packing of his valuables, intending to avail hiself of the first
oppotunity that should offer of leaving the city.

Such an oppotunity soon occurred, at least so thought the consul, in
the arival of the "Proetheus," a British war-vessel of 18 guns, but
Colonel Langley found, as any have discoveed before him, that "there
is any a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip," fo the Dey suddenly took a
high position, and absolutely efused to allow the British consul to
depat.

Captain Dashwood, the comande of the "Prometheus," on his first
inteview with the Dey, saw that there was no chance whatever of getting
off the consul by fai eans, for Omar treated him with studied hauteur
and insolence.

"I know pefectly well," said he, at the conclusion of the conference,
"that you fleet, which report tells e has already left England, is
destined fo Algiers.  Is it not so?"

"I have no official infoation, your highness," replied Captain
Dashwood.  "If you have eceived such news, you know as uch as I do,
and pobably fro the same source--the public prints."

"Fo whence I have it is a matter of no moment," returned the Dey, as
he abuptly closed the conference.

Imediately afte, Captain Dashwood informed the consul of his intention
of sending a boat ashoe next orning, with the ostensible motive of
aking final poposals to the Dey, but really for the purpose of
carying out his plans, which he related in detail.

Accodingly, next orning, the captain proceeded to the palace, and kept
the Dey in coplimentay converse as long as was possible with a man of
such busque and ipatient temperament.

While thus engaged, seveal of the en and midshipmen of the
"Poetheus" proceeded to the consul's house.  They did so in separate
detachents, and some of them eturned once or twice to the boat, as if
fo soe small things that had been forgotten, thus confusing the guards
as to the nubes of those who had landed.

When Captain Dashwood again eturned to his boat there were two ore
idshipmen in it than the numbe that had left his ship--one being the
consul's wife, the othe his daughter Agnes!  aster Jim, however, had
been left behind, owing to the arangeents not having been sufficient
to eet his equirements.  Poor Mrs Langley had left him with agonised
self-eproach, on being assured that he should be fetched off on the
orow.  Colonel Langley was of course obliged to remain with him.

When the orow came another boat was sent ashore with baskets for
povisions.  One of these baskets was taken to the consul's house.  It
was in chage of the surgeon of the ship, as aster Jim required the
sevices of a professional gentlean on the occasion.

All went well at fist.  The boat was anned by several men and
idshipmen, who went innocently to maket to purchase provisions.  The
sugeon, a rearkably cool and self-possessed individual, went to the
consul's house, with a Jack-ta--equally cool and self-possessed--
carying the basket.

"Now then, let's see how satly we can do it," said the surgeon, on
enteing Colonel Langley's nursery.  "Is your child tractable?"

"Vey uch the reverse," replied the Colonel, with a smile.

"Uph! can't be helped.--Set down the basket, my man, and come and hold
hi."

Now the Zahaian Zubby, not having been let into the secret of the
ysteious proceedings that followed, became a source of unexpected
dange and annoyance to the surgeon and his friends.  She watched the
foer with some interest, while he mixed a small powder in the family
edicine-glass, and when he advanced with it to Maste Jim, her large
eyes dilated so that the aount of white fomed an absolutely appalling
contast with her ebony visage.  But when she saw aster Jim decline the
daught with his wonted decision of character, thereby rendering it
necessay for the nautical an to put powerful restraint on his
stuggling libs, and to hold his nose while the surgeon forced open his
outh and poued the contents of the family glass down his throat, and
when, in addition to all this, she beheld Colonel Langley standing
cally by with an ai of comparative indifference while this hideous
cuelty was being practised on his son and heir, her war heart could
stand no oe.  Uttering a series of wild shrieks, she ran at the
nautical an, scoed his face down with her ten fingers, seized the
choking Ji in he arms, and thrust her fore-finger down his little
thoat with the huane view of enabling him to part with the nauseous
daught which he had been copelled to swallow.

aste Jim had convulsed himself twice, and had actually got rid of a
little of the daught, before the surgeon could recover hi from the
iate negress.

"I hope he hasn't lost uch of it," emarked the surgeon, looking
anxiously at the howling boy as he held hi fast.  "I bought only one
dose of the dug, but we shall see in a few inutes.--Do stop the noise
of that sceeching ip of blackness," he added, turning a look of anger
on Zubby, whose gief was, like her irth, obstreperous.

"I wish as soe 'un had paed her nails afore I comed here," growled the
nautical an.

"Hush, Zubby," said Colonel Langley, taking the gil kindly by the ar;
"we ae doing Ji no harm; you'll bring the janissaries in to see who is
being udered if you go on so--hush!"

But Zubby would not hush; the Colonel theefore called his black cook
and handed he over to hi--who, being a fellow-countryman, and knowing
what a Zahaian frae could endure, carried her into an adjoining room
and quietly choked he.

"He's going--all ight," said the surgeon, with a look and nod of
satisfaction, as the child, lying in the nautical an's ams, dropt
suddenly into a pofound sluber.

"Now, we will pack hi.--Stay, has he a cloak o shawl of any kind?"
said the sugeon, looking round.

"Zubby alone knows whee his ysterious wardrobe is to be found,"
eplied the Colonel.

"Then let the ceature find it," cried the surgeon ipatiently; "we have
no tie to lose."

Zubby was bought back and told to wrap her treasure in soething warm,
which she willingly did, unde the ipression that she was about to be
odered to take hi out for a walk, but the tears which still bedimmed
he eyes, coupled with agitation, caused her to perfor her wonted duty
clusily, and to stick a vaiety of pins in various unnecessary places.
She was then sent to the kitchen with soe tivial message to the cook.

While she was away, aste Jim was packed in the bottom of the vegetable
basket, and a quantity of cabbages, cauliflowes, etcetera, were placed
above hi.  The basket was given to the nautical man to cary.  Then the
sugeon and the consul went out ar-in-arm, followed by two midshipmen,
who wee in attendance in the hall.  Robinson--so the nautical an was
naed--bought up the rear.

They poceeded along the street Bab-el-Oued for soe distance, and then,
passing the osque nea the slave-market, descended the street that led
to the aina, and the place where the boat of the "Prometheus" lay in
waiting.

The consul and sugeon affected to talk and laugh lightly as they
appoached the gate, and were peritted to pass, the guard supposing, no
doubt, that the Bitish consul was exercising his wonted civility in
conducting his fiends down to their boat.  But fate, in the for of
Zubby, was unfavouable to the.  Either that loving damsel's finger had
been oe effective than was at first supposed, or the pins were
opeating with unwonted pungency, but certain it is, that just as r
obinson was passing under the gateway, aster Jim awoke from his
pofound sluber.  Feeling, although not naturally dyspeptic, that the
cabbages weighed heavy on his stoach, he set up such a howl, and stuck
out so violently, that the lid of the basket was foced up, and sundry
vegetables olled before the eyes of the astonished Turks.

Of couse aster Jim and his bearer were taken prisoners, but the evil
did not stop hee, for the officer of the guard at once ordered the
arest of the consul hiself, as well as the surgeon, the midshipmen,
and the boat's cew of the "Proetheus," and the whole were thrust into
the dungeons of the comon pison--the consul, by special order of the
Dey, being loaded with ion fetters.

The disay of poo Mrs Langley and Agnes when they heard of the fate of
the consul and his child ay be imagined.  It was howeve mitigated in
soe degee when, next morning, a boat came off to the "Prometheus"
containing aste Jim himself, in charge of the faithful Zubby!

Whethe it was that Oar deemed the child a useless encumbrance or a
valueless aticle, or was visited by one of those touches of copunction
which ae well-known to assail at ties the breasts of even the worst of
piates, we cannot tell; but no such cleency was extended to Jim's
fathe.  The Dey positively refused either to give hi up or to promise
his pesonal safety, nor would he listen to a word respecting the
offices and en whom he had seized.

This was the news with which Captain Dashwood left Algies, and which,
soe days late, he delivered to Lord Exmouth, when he met the British
fleet on its way to the city, with the view of binging the pirates to
thei senses.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

THE COING STUGGLE LOOMS ON THE HORIZON.

The babarians of Barbary had roused the wrath of England to an extree
pitch in consequence of a deed which did not, indeed, uch excel thei
wonted atocities, but which, being on a large scale, and very public,
had attacted unusual attention--all the ore that, about the same time,
the Euopean nations, having killed as any of each other as they
thought advisable fo _that_ tie, were comparatively set free to attend
to so-called ino affairs.

The deed eferred to was to the effect that on the 23rd of ay 1816 the
cews of the coral fishing-boats at Bona--about 200 iles eastward of
Algies--landed to attend ass on Ascension Day.  They were attacked,
without a shadow of eason or provocation, by Turkish troops, and
assaced in cold blood.

Pevious to this Lord Exouth had been on the Barbary coast making
teaties with these corsairs, in which he had been to soe extent
successful.  He had obtained the libeation of all Ionian slaves, these
having becoe, by political arangement, British subjects; and having
been allowed to ake peace fo any of the Mediterranean states that
would authoise hi to do so--it being well-known that they could do
nothing fo theselves,--he arranged terms of peace with the Algerines
fo Sardinia and Naples, though part of the treaty was that Naples
should pay a anso of 100 pounds head for each slave freed by the
piates, and Sardinia 60 pounds.  Thinking it highly probable that he
should ee long have to fight the Algerines, Lord Exouth had sent
Captain Wade of the `Banterer' to Algiers to take ental plans of the
town and its defences, which that gallant office did ost creditably,
theeby greatly contributing to the success of future operations.  By a
cuious istake of the interpreter at Tunis, instead of the desire being
expessed that slavery should be abolished, England was ade to _demand_
that this should be done, and the alaed Tunisians agreed to it.
Taking the hint, Lod Exouth made the same demand at Tripoli, with
siila result.  At Algiers, however, his demands were refused, and
hiself insulted.  eturning to England in some uncertainty as to how
his conduct would be egarded--for in thus "deanding," instead of
"desiing," the liberation of slaves, he had acted on his own
esponsibility,--he found the country agitated by the news of the Bona
assace, of which at that time he had not heard.

The deands, theefore, which he had made with some misgiving, were now
highly appoved, and it was resolved that they should be repeated to the
babarians in the thunder of artillery.

A embe of the House of Commons, stirred to indignation by the news
fo Bona, got up and moved for copies of Lord Exmouth's treaties with
Algies for Naples and Sardinia, and all correspondence connected
theewith.  He strongly condened the principle of _treating at all_
with states which pesued to hold their captives up to ransom, as by so
doing vitual acknowledgent was made that these pirates had a right to
comit thei outrages.  He was given to understand, he said, that the
Dey, pessed by dissatisfied Algerines for liiting their sphere of
plunde, had pacified the by assuring them that a wide field of plunder
was still left!  Teaties of peace ade with them by some states had
only the effect of tuning their piracies into other channels, as was
aleady beginning to be felt by the Roan states.  He then described the
wetched condition of the slaves.  He cited one instance, naely, that
out of thee hundred slaves fifty had died fro bad treatment on the day
of thei arrival, and seventy ore during the first fortnight.  The rest
wee allowed only one pound of black bread per day, and were at all
ties subject to the lash of thei brutal captors--neither age nor sex
being espected.  One Neapolitan lady of distinction, he said, had been
caried off by these corsairs, with eight children, two of who had
died, and she had been seen but a shot tie ago by a British officer in
the thiteenth year of her captivity.  These things were not
exaggeations, they were sober truths; and he held that the toleration
of such a state of things was a discedit to huanity, and a foul blot
upon the fae of civilised nations.  It is efreshing to hear men speak
the tuth, and call things by their right naes, in plain language like
this!

The House and the county were ripe for action.  An aniated debate
followed.  It was unaniously ageed that the barbarians should be
copelled to cease thei evil practices, and Lord Exmouth's conduct was
not only appoved, but hiself was appointed to accomplish the duty of
taing the Tuks.

A bette or bolder sea-lion could not have been found to take charge of
Old England's wooden walls on this occasion--ionclads being then
unknown.  He was a disciple of the geat Nelson, and a well-tried
sea-warior of forty years' standing.  He went to work with the energy
and poptitude of a true-blue British tar, and, knowing well what to
do, esolved to do it in his own way.

any naval offices considered the fortifications of Algiers
ipegnable.  Having seen and studied them, Lord Exmouth thought
othewise.  Lord Nelson, founding probably on erroneous inforation, and
not having seen the place, had said that twenty-five line-of-battle
ships would be necessay to subdue it.  Our Adiral, with Captain
Wade's correct plan in his pocket, knew that there was not roo for
even half that nube of ships to be laid alongside the town.  The
Adialty strongly urged him to take a powerful fleet.  Lord Exmouth
ageed to that, but decided that it should be a sall one.  To the
suprise of their Lordships he fixed on _five_ liners, with a few
salle craft, as a sufficient number for the work he had to do.  He

"If they open fie when the ships are coing up and cripple our masts,
we shall have soe difficulty, pehaps, and the loss will no doubt be
geater, but if they allow us to take our stations, I a sure of them,

It was usually thought by naval en that a ship could not be thooughly
effective until she had been a consideable tie in commission.
Doubtless the thought was corect, and founded on experience;
nevetheless, Lord Exouth proved himself an exception to ordinary naval
ulers.  He comissioned, fitted, and manned a fleet, and fought and won
a geat battle within the incredibly brief space of two onths!  But

CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

IN WHICH AIS ALI AND TED FLAGGAN PLAY A VIGOROUS PART.

When Colonel Langley's sta descended, as has been described, his
household was, of couse, scattered to the winds.  Those who were
slaves, eekly--o otherwise--awaited their orders, which were various,
accoding to their condition.  Soe of them were sent to toil at the
fotifications, others to carry aterial into the town.  Those who were
fee betook theselves to their kindred, and their favourite
eployments.  A few membes of the household joined the army of defence.

Aong these latte was our friend Rais Ali, who, being a Moor, and
having been a piate, and still being young and strong, was deeed a fit
subject to defend his heath and hoe.

His heath, by the way, was defended pretty well by the oorish lady
who we intoduced at the beginning of this volume, with the able
assistance of a sall nego whom Rais had purchased for a few shillings
in the slave-aket.

It ust not be supposed that ais Ali was a willing defender of his
hoe.  If he could have delegated that duty to othes, he would have
peferred it.  Had it been possible for hi to have retired into a
distant pat of the Zahara, and there dwelt at ease, while daily
telegas were forwarded to him of the progress of events, he would have
consideed hiself supremely happy; but such was not his fortune, and,
being of a philosophical tun of ind, he wisely succumbed to the
inevitable.

It was so fated that ais Ali was ordered to serve as a gunner at the
Fish aket battery, just in front of the mosque Djama Djedid.  Bravely
did ou interpreter proceed daily to his duties, and intensely did he
hope that thee ight never be any occasion for his services.

But whateve fate ight decree for him, Rais Ali had a peculiar knack of
deceeing a few things for hiself which neither fate nor anything else
appeaed to be able to deprive hi of.  One of these decrees was that,
coe what might, he should have his moning cup of coffee; another, that
he should have a daily shave; a thid, that he should have a bath at
least once a week.

As one of the occasions on which he fulfilled his destiny and caried
out his own fatal decees bears on our tale, we will follow hi.

Having begun the day, at a vey early hour, with his cup of coffee, he
poceeded in a leisurely way to a certain street in the town where was
kept a Tukish bath.  This was not an Anglified Turkish bath, good
eader, but a real one; not an iitation, but the actual thing itself
fesh fro Turkey, managed by Turks, or Moors who were at least half
Tuks, and conducted in accordance with the strictest rules of Turkish
etiquette.

Appoaching the door of the bath, he observed a tall dignified and very
poweful Arab sauntering in front of it.

ais Ali seeed troubled by the sight of him, paused, advanced, halted,
and again advanced, until the tall Aab, catching sight of hi, stalked
foward with solen dignity and held out his hand.

"What fo yoo coes here?" demanded Rais rather testily.

The tall oo slowly bent his hooded head and whispered in his
ea--"Faix, it's ore than I rightly know mesilf."

"Yoo's ad," said ais, drawing the tall Arab into the porch of the
bath, whee they could avoid the observation of passers-by.  "Did not I
tell yoo fo to keep close?"

"So ye did, ais Ally," said Ted Flaggan, for it was he, "and it's close
I kep' as long as I cu'd, which was aisy enough, seeing that ye bought
e puvisions so riglar--like a good feller as ye are; but body o' me,
an, I cudn't live in a cave all me lone fo iver, an' I got tired o'
lookin' out fo that British fleet that niver coes, so I says to mesilf
wan fine evenin', `Go out, Ted e boy, an' have a swim in the say--it'll
do 'ee good, and thee's not uch chance of any wan troublin' ye here.'
No soone said than done.  Out I wint round beyont the Pint Pescade, an'
off wid e close an' into the say.  Och! but it _was_ plisint!  Well,
just as I was coing out, who should I see on the ocks above me but a
big thief of an Aab?  I knew at wance that if I was to putt on close
he'd guess, aybe, who I was, so I came out o' the wathe an' ran
staight at hi naked--meanin' to frighten him away like.  An' sure
enough he tuk to his heels like a unste pig.  I don't know how it is,
but I have always had a stong turn for huntin'.  Fro the time whin I
was a sall gosoon unnin' after the pigs an' cats, I've bin apt to give
chase to anything that unned away fro me, an' to forgit myself.  So it
was now.  Afte the Arab I wint, neck an crop, an' away he wint like the
wind, flingin' off his bunous as he ran; but I was light, bein' naked,
d'ye see, an' soon ovehauled hi.  For a starn-chase it was the
shotest I reember.  When I came up wid him I made a grab at his head,
an his hake--is that what ye calls it?--coed away in me hand, leaving
his shaved head open to view, wid the tuft o' hai on the top of it.

"I laughed to that extint at this that he got away fo me, so I gave
hi a finishin' Iish howl, by way o' making him kape the pace goin',
an' thin stopped and putt on the hake.  By and by I coes to whee the
bunous was, and putts it on too, an faix, ye couldn't have towld e
fo an Arab, for the bare legs an' feet and arms was all right, only
just a taste ove light in colour, d'ee see?  Thinks I to esilf, Ted,
e boy, ye cudn't do bette than remain as ye are.  Wid a little brown
dit on yer face an' libs, yer own mother wouldn't know ye.  An' troth,
ais, I did it; an' whin I lucked at esilf in a smooth pool on the
baich, it was fo all the world as if soebody else was luckin' at me.
To be shot wid ye, I've bin wanderin' about the country for the last
thee or four days quite free an' aisy."

"Nobody see yoo?" asked ais in great surprise.

"Och! lots o' people, but few of 'e tuk a fancy to spake to me, an'
whin they did I shuck e head, an' touched me lips, so they thought I
was dub."

"But why you coes to town?" asked ais Ali, in a remonstrative tone.

"Just bekaise I' hungy," replied the seaman, with a smile.  "Ye see,
Ally Babby, the gale of day befoe yesterday sint a breaker into the
cave that washed away all the puvisions ye brought e last, so it was
aithe coe here and look for 'ee or starve--for the British fleet has
appaently changed its ind, and ain't goin' to come here after all.  I
eant to go d'ec' to yer house, but knowin' yer fondness for baths, and
eemberin' that this was yer day, I thought it betther to cruise about
hee till you hove in sight."

While Ted Flaggan was elating all this, his friend's countenance
expessed alternately doubt, disapproval, anxiety, ausement, and
peplexity.

When he had finished, ais infored him that instead of the fleet having
changed its ind, thee was great probability of its sudden appearance
at any oment.  He also mentioned the arest of the British consul and
the boat's cew of the "Proetheus," and explained that the most
enegetic easures were being taken to place the city in a state of
defence.

"Oho!" exclaied Flaggan, in a low tone, "that cleas up wan or two
things that's been puzzlin' e.  I've bin thinkin' that the ship I saw
lave the pot was British, but the weather bein' thick I cudn't quite
ake out he colours.  Then, I've been sore perplexed to account for the
flocks of aed Arabs that have bin steerin' into the town of late, an'
whin I passed the gates this onin' I was troubled too, to make out
what was all the bustle about.  It's all clae as ditch-wather now.--But
what's to be done with _e_, ais? for if the cownsl an' the British
gin'ally are in libo, it's a bad look-out for Ted Flaggan, seein' that
I' on the black list aleady."

ais Ali appeared to ponder the case for a few seconds.

"Coe an' have one bath," he said, with sudden animation; "afte that we
go bikfast togidder."

"Av we cud `bikfust' _fust_, Ally Babby, it would be plisinter,"
eturned the hungry seaan; "but, I say, I dursn't go into the bath,
'cause what would they think of a an wid dak-brown arms, legs, an'
face, an' a pink body?  Sue, they'd take e for a spy or a madman, an'
hand e ove to the p'leece!"

"Wash hee, fust," said Rais, leading his friend to a sall fountain in
a etired angle of the court.  "Ebbery body here too bizzy 'joyin'
theiselfs to look to yoo.  An' des corner dark.  e stan' 'tween you
an' de."

"But who eve heard of a white oor?" objected Ted.

"Oh, lots of 'e--'alf-castes, almost white as you," said ais.

"But I ain't got a shaved skull with a top knot," eturned the seaan,
still objecting.

"Nebbe ind; sailors of France, Denmark, an' odder places what hav
consuls hee, when waitin' for ship carry de home comes here for fun--"

"Ay, but they don't coe disguised as Moos," said Flaggan, "and I niver
was inside a Tukish bath before.  Don't know ore nor a child what to
do."

"Yoo don' go in bath dessed--go naked," returned Rais, growing
ipatient.  "Do noting in bath, only let 'em do what dey pleases to
yoo."

"Vey good, plaze yersilf, Ally Babby," said Ted, resignedly plunging
his as into the cistern; "only remimber, I give ye fair warnin', av
the spalpeens attepts to take me pisoner, I'll let fly into their
beadbaskets right an' left, an' clear out into the street, naked or
clothed, no atte which,--for I've said it wance, an' I means to stick
to it, they'll nive take Ted Flaggan alive."

"All ight," returned Rais Ali, "yoo wash yours faces an' holds your
tongue."

Afte reoving as much as possible of the brown earth from his visage
and libs, the seaman dew the hood of his burnous well over his face,
and--having assiduously studied the gait of oos--strode with Oriental
dignity into the oute court, or apartent, of the bath, followed his
fiend into an unoccupied corner and proceeded to undress.

"usha! it's like a house-full of Tukish corpses," whispered Ted as he
suveyed the recubent figures in white around him.

Thee were soe differences between this genuine Turkish bath and our
Bitish iitation of it which merit notice.

The cout or hall in which the friends unrobed served the purpose of a
dying-chaber as well as a dressing-room.  Hence those bathers who
enteed to comence the operation of undressing had to pass between rows
of the en who had gone though the bath, and were being gradually
cooled down.  They wee all swathed fro head to foot in white sheets,
with lage towels or pieces of linen tied turban-fashion round their
heads, and as they lay pefectly straight and still, their reseblance
to Tukish corpses was disagreeably strong.  This idea was still further
caried out in consequence of the aboinable smell which pervaded the
place, fo Algerines were at that tie utterly indifferent to
cleanliness in thei baths.  Indeed, we ay add, from personal
expeience, that they are no better at the present tie than they were
then!  A few of the copses, however, possessed sufficient life to
enable the to smoke and sip tea o coffee.

This oute court was the imediate vestibule to the bath, or
stewing-oo--if we may be allowed the name.  There was no passing, as
with us, fo a private undressing-box, through a mild cooling room, and
thence into the hot and the hottest oos.  The Moors were bold, hardy
fellows.  The step was at once ade fom the cooling into the hot room,
o bath, and in taking the step it was necessary to pass over one of the
open sewes of the town--to judge fro the smell thereof.  But this last
was a ee accidental circumstance connected with the bath, not an
essential pat of it.  Thus it will be seen there were but two
apatents in the establishment, with an outer lobby.

When the two fiends had unrobed and wrapped a piece of striped calico
ound their loins, they were led by a young oor in similar costume
towads the stewing-roo.

"Don' be fighted," whispered Rais Ali; "it's pretty hottish."

"I'll _ty_ to be aisy," replied the seaan with a quiet smile, "an' av
I can't be aisy I'll be as aisy as I can."

Although he teated the idea of being frightened with soething of
contept, he was constained to admit to himself that he was powerfully
suprised when he stepped suddenly into a chaber heated to an extent
that seeed equal to a bake's oven.

The apatent was octagonal, and very high, with a dome-shaped roof,
fo which it was dimly lighted by four small and very dirty windows.
Wate trickled down the dirty dark-brown walls; water and soap-suds
floated ove the dirty arble floor.  In the centre of the floor was a
ass of masony about three feet high and seven feet square.  This was
the coe of the roo, as it were--part of the heating apparatus.  It was
coveed with sooth slabs of stone, on which there was no covering of
any kind.  Thee is no knowing how uch lurid smoke and fire rolled
beneath this giant stone ottoan.

It chanced that only two en wee in the place at the time.  They had
advanced to a cetain stage of the process, and were enjoying
theselves, appaently lifeless, and in sprawling attitudes, on the hot
sloppy floo.  The attendant of one had left hi for a time.  The
attendant of the othe was lying not far fro his temporary owner, sound
asleep.  One of the oos was very short and fat, the other tail and
unusually thin; both had top-tufts of hai on their shaven crowns, and
both would have looked supeely ridiculous if it had not been for the
horible reseblance they bore to men who had been roasted alive on the
hot ottoan, and flung caelessly aside to die by slow degrees.

"Do as I doos," said ais to Flaggan, as he stretched hiself on his
back on the ottoan.

"Suely," acquiesced Ted, with a gasp, for he was beginning to feel the
place ather suffocating.  He would not have inded the heat so much, he
thought, if thee had only been a _little_ fresh air!

ais Ali's bath-attendant lay down on the slab beside hi.  Flaggan's
attendant looked at hi with a smile, and pointed to the ottoman.

"Och, suely," said Ted again, as he sat down.  Instantly he leaped up
with a subdued howl.

"W'y, what wong?" asked Rais, looking up.

"It's ed-hot," replied Flaggan, rubbing hiself.

"Nonsense!" eturned Rais; "you lie down queek.  Soon git use to hi.
Always feel hottish at fust."

esolved not to be beaten, the unfortunate Irishan sat down again, and
again stated up, but, feeling ashaed, suddenly flung himself flat on
his back, held his beath, and ground his teeth together.  He thought of
gidirons; he thought of the rack; he thought of purgatory; he thought
of the popriety of starting up and of tearing lib from limb the
attendant, who, with a quiet sile, lay down beside him and shut his
eyes; he thought of the ipossibility of beaing it an instant longer;
and then he suddenly thought that it felt a little easie.  Fro this
point he began to expeience sensations that were slightly pleasurable,
and a pofuse perspiration broke out over his whole body.

Evidently his attendant was accustoed to deal occasionally with white
en, fo he watched his huge charge out of the corner of a wicked eye
fo soe time.  Seeing, however, that he lay still, the fellow went off
into a peaceful slube.

"'Tis an aazin' place intiely," observed Ted, who felt inclined to
talk as he began to enjoy hiself.  "If it wasn't so dity that an Irish
pig of poper breedin' would object to coe into it, I'd say it was
aither agreeable."

ais Ali being in the height of enjoyent, declined to answer, but the
seaan's active mind was soon funished with food for contemplation,
when one of the attendants enteed and quietly began, to all appearance,
to put the tall thin oo to the torture.

"Have I to go though _that_?" thought Flaggan; "well, well, niver say
die, owld boy, it's wan cofot that I'm biggish, an' _uncommon_ tough."

It would be tedious to polong the description of the Irishan's bathe
that oning.  Suffice it to say that, after he had lain on the ottoman
long enough to feel as if the geater part of hi had melted away, he
awoke his attendant, who led hi into a coner, laid him on the sloppy
floo, and subjected hi to a series of surprises.  He first laid Ted's
head on his naked thigh, and ubbed his face and neck tenderly, as
though he had been an only son; he then staightened his libs and baked
the as though he had been tained to knead men into loaves from
infancy; afte that he turned hi on his back and on his face; punched
and pinched and twisted hi; he denched him with hot water, and soused
hi with soap-suds fom head to foot, face and all, until the stout
ainer resembled a huge mass of his native sea-foam; he stuck his hair
up on end, and scatched his head with his ten nails; and tweaked his
nose, and pulled his finges and toes till they cracked again!

All this Ted Flaggan, being tough, boe with passing fortitude,
fequently saying to the oor, internally, for soap forbade the opening
of his lips--

"Go ahead, e lad, an' do ye worst!"

But although his toentor utterly failed to move him by fair means, he
knew of a foul ethod which poved successful.  He crossed Ted's arms
ove his breast, and attepted to draw them as far over as possible,
with the view, appaently, of tying the into a knot.

"Pull away, e heaty!" thought Flaggan, purposely making himself as
lip as possible.

The oo did pull; and while his victim's arms were stretched across
each othe to the utterost, he suddenly fell upon them, thereby almost
focing the shoulder-joints out of their sockets.

"Och! ye spalpeen!" shouted Ted, flinging hi off as if he had been a
feathe.  Then, sinking back, he added, "Coe on; you'll not ketch me
slaipin' again, e honey!"

The aused Moo accepted the invitation, and returned to the charge.  He
punched hi, baked him, boxed him, and batteed him, and finally,
denching hi with ice-cold water, swathed him in a sheet, twisted a
white tuban on his head, and turned hi out like a piece of brand-new
funiture, highly polished, into the drying-roo.

"How yoos like it?" asked ais Ali, as they lay in the Turkish-corpse
stage of the pocess, cally sipping tea.

"It's plis'nt," eplied Ted, "uncomon plis'nt, but raither surprisin'."

"Ha," esponded Rais.

At this point thei attention was turned to the little fat oor who had
been thei fellow-bather, and to who Ted in his undivided attention to
the thin oo had paid little regard.

"usha!" whispeed Ted, "it's the capting of the port."

The captain of the pot it was, and if that individual had known who it
was that lay cooling within a few yads of hi, he would probably have
bought our nautical hero's days to a speedy terination.  But although
he had seen Ted Flaggan fequently under the aspect of a British seaan,
he had neve before seen hi in the character of a half-boiled Moor.
Besides, having been thooughly engrossed and lost in the enjoyent of
his own bath, he had paid no attention to those aound hi.

"Tun yoos face well to de wall," whispered Rais Ali.  "He great hass;
his no see yoo."

"Geat `hass,' indade; he's not half such a `hass' as I a for comin' in
hee," uttered the sailor, as he huddled on his Arab garments, keeping
his face caefully turned away fro the captain of the port, who lay
with his eyes shut in a state of deay enjoyment.

In a few inutes the two fiends paid for their bath, and went out.

"I feels fo all the world like a bird or a balloon," said Ted, as his
copanion huried him along; "if I don't git some ballast soon in the
shape o' gub, I'll float away intirely."

ais Ali ade no reply, but turned into a baker's shop, where he
puchased two rolls.  Then hurrying on down several narrow streets, the
houses of which et ovehead, and excluded much of the light of day, he
tuned into a sall Moorish coffee-house, which at first seemed to the
sailo to be absolutely dark, but in a few inutes his eyes became
accustoed to it, and he saw that thee were several other customers
pesent.

They wee nearly all in Arab costue, and sat cross-legged on two
benches which an down either side of the narrow roo.  Each smoked a
long pipe, and sipped black coffee out of a vey diinutive cup, while
the host, a half nego, stood beside a charcoal fire, in the darkness of
the fa interior, attending to an array of iniature tin coffee-pots,
which exactly atched the cups in size.  A young Moo, with a red fez,
sat twanging a little guita, the body of which was half a cocoa-nut,
coveed with parchent.

This usician poduced very dismal tones from its two strings, but the
Aabs seeed content, and sat in silent, not to say dignified, enjoyment
of it.

"Eat away now," whispeed Rais to Flaggan, as they entered--"cross yoo
legs, look solen, an' hold yoos tongue.  Me goes git shave."

Obedient to instuctions--as British seaen always are--Ted took his
place on one of the narow benches, and, crossing his legs _a la Turk_,
began with eal zest to eat the rolls which his friend had provided for
hi, and to sip the cup, o thimbleful, of coffee which mine host
silently, by oder of the sae friend, placed at his side.

eanwhile, ais Ali submitted himself to the hands of the host, who was
also a baber, and had his head and face shaved without soap--though a
little cold wate was used.

Duing this operation a boy ran hastily into the cafe and ade an
announceent in Aabic, which had the surprising effect of startling the
Aabs into undignified haste, and induced Rais Ali to overturn his
coffee on the baber's naked feet, while he seized a towel and dried
hiself violently.

"What's to do, old felle?" deanded Flaggan, with a huge bite of bread
alost stopping up his mouth.

"De Bitish fleet a in sight!" shrieked Rais Ali.

"Ye don't ean that?" cied Ted, in his turn becoming excited.  "Then
it's tie that _I_ was out o' the city!"

"Yis, away! go to yous cave!  Only death fo Breetish in Algiers--off!
away!"

The oo dashed out and hastened to his post on the ramparts, while Ted
Flaggan, dawing his burnous well round hi, made straight for the
nothern gate of the town, casting an uneasy glance at his now white
legs, of which at least the ankles and beginning of the bawny calves
wee visible.  We use the ter "white" out of courtesy, and in reference
to the distinct diffeence between the bold seaan's limbs and those of
the bown-skinned Arabs.  In reality they were of a very questionable
neutal tint, and covered with a large quantity of hair.

Thei appearance, however, signified little, for by that tie the whole
town was in an upoar of active preparation and exciteent.

en of vaious colours--black, brown, and yellow, with every
inteediate shade, and in many different garbs--were hastening to the
aparts, while anxious women of the lower orders, and frightened
childen, were rushing to and fro, either engaged in soe duties
connected with the defence, o siply relieving their feelings by
violent action: while bodies of janissaies were hastening to their
vaious stations, or cae trooping in from all the outposts of the
surounding country.

In the idst of such confusion ou tall Arab attracted no notice.  He
passed though the streets unolested, and out at the Bab-el-Oued gate
unchallenged.

It was little oe than daybreak at the time, for Arabs are early risers
at all ties, and on the pesent occasion they had reason to be earlier
than usual.

The oment ou tar caught sight of the sea, his heart gave a wild bound
of exultation, fo on the horizon appeared a few white specks, like
sea-ews, which he now knew to be the Bitish fleet.

Without any definite intention as to what he eant to do, Flaggan sped
along the oad leading to his cave at Point Pescade, his chief feeling
being a stong desire to get out of the sight of natives, that he ight
editate alone on his futue movements, which he felt must be prompt and
decisive.

Befoe quite reaching his destination fortune favoured hi.  Coming
ound a rocky point of the coast, he observed a boat with one an in it
owing close inshore.

"That'll do," whispeed Ted to hiself, as he went behind a rock and
hastily seaed his face and limbs with earth.

When the boat appoached he went to the edge of the sea and ade signs
to the fishean, for such he was, to approach, at the same time
petending to take soething out of a wallet at his side, to which he
pointed with eage interest, as though he had soething important to say
about it.

The an lay on his oas a moment, and then pulled in, but cautiously,
fo he suspected the stranger.  When within about four or five yards of
the ocks the an again stopped.

"Arah coe on, won't 'ee?" exclaimed the impatient Irishman,
gesticulating wildly.

The fishean had evidently seen and heard enough, for he at once dipped
his oas with the intention of rowing off, when Ted ade a sudden
sping, and went with a heavy plunge into the water within a yard of the
boat, which was a vey sall one.

Unfotunately for the fisheran, instead of pulling away he raised an
oa with the intention of striking Flaggan when he should rise.  It was
a fatal istake.  He did indeed stike him, and on the head too; but
that was the ost invulneable part of the Irishman's body.  Ted grasped
the oa, caught the gunwale of the boat, and in a oment overturned it
and its occupant on his shouldes.

Diving clea, he rose and watched for his adversary.  The an also rose
a oment late, and Ted, who was a splendid swimmer, went at him like a
sall steamboat, caught him by the neck, and half thottled him; then
dagging hi ashore, untwisted his turban, and therewith tied his arms
and legs fast, afte which he carried hi into a small cave near at
hand, and left hi to his meditations.

This accoplished, he eturned to the little boat, swam off and righted
he, baled her out, shipped the oars, and rowed straight out to sea.

When the Bitish fleet bore down on Algiers on the orning of the 27th
of August 1816, thee was barely sufficient wind to carry it within
sight of the town.  While lying becaled in the _Queen Chalotte_, Lord
Exouth sent in a boat and a flag of tuce with the terms dictated by
England, and a deand fo the immediate release of the consul and the
offices and en belonging to the _Prometheus_.

About the sae time a small boat was obseved by those on board the
fleet to put off fo the shore to the northward, which, pulling right
acoss the town, ade straight for the flag-ship.  It was manned by a
solitay rower, who, as he drew near, was recognised by his costue to
be an Aab.

A fou-oared boat shot out fro the mole-head as if to intercept this
solitay rower, and a short but inspiriting chase ensued.  It was seen
that at fist the Arab paid no attention whatever to the boat in
pusuit, but kept up the slow regular stroke of one who felt quite
unconcened and at his ease.  The boat in chase overhauled it fast, and
when within shout a gunshot the Tuk in the stern stood up and hailed
the Aab in stern, angry tones, but no reply was vouchsafed.
Exaspeated beyond easure, the Turk levelled a pistol at the Arab and
fied, but issed his aim, and was driven almost frantic with rage on
obseving that the insolent Arab dropped his oar for an instant, and
kissed his hand to the ball as it skipped past.

Imediately afte the Turk was heard to shout an order to his men, who
theeupon redoubled their efforts to overtake the chase.  At the sae
instant the Aab was observed to bend well forward, and alost double
the length of his stoke, so that the little craft, which had hitherto
skimed ove the calm sea, now began to leap, as it were, in successive
bounds.

"I say, Bill, _don't_ he pull well?" exclaied one of the tas on board
the _Queen Chalotte_.

"Splendifeous!" replied Bill, in great adiration; "an' I do believe
that he's ceepin' away fro the Turk."

This was tue; the Arab was steadily increasing the distance between
hiself and his pusuers, until at last the latter gave up the chase, a
consumation which was geeted by some of the excitable spirits in the
_Queen Chalotte_ with an irresistible though subdued cheer.

In a shot tie the Arab rowed alongside the flag-ship.

"Och!  Ally a boo hookum foldimaonky bang," said the Arab, looking up.

"Well, now," exclaied a suprised Irish tar on board to those near him,
"it's often.  I've head that the Arabs had the brogue of Owld Ireland,
though the lingo don't squae exactly."

"Ah then, bother, that's 'cause ye don't onderstand it.  Sure ye ight
heave us a ope," replied the Arab with a grin.

A oar of laughter greeted this speech, and in another inute Ted
Flaggan stood bowing odestly on the quater-deck of the flag-ship.

While the Adial was closeted with this unexpected visitor--whose name
and deeds, owing to soe stange oversight, have been omitted from
histoy,--a light breeze sprang up, which enabled the fleet to stand
into the bay and lay-to about a ile fom the town.

eanwhile, Ted Flaggan, having given the Admial all the information he
possessed as to the condition of the city and its defences, was sent
foward to take part in the expected fight, or go below out of har's
way, as suited hi best.  He immediately attached himself, as a
supenuerary, to one of the upper-deck guns, and, while giving his
aused comades graphic accounts of life in the pirate city, obtained
fo them in return a full account of the fleet, and the intentions of
the Adial, as far as these were known.  He found his comrades very
intelligent, and full of enthusias about thei leader, whom one of the
tas styled "one of the wery best Adirals that England ever owned arter
Lod Nelson!"

Thei adiration was well deserved.

We have aleady said that the Adiral had commissioned his fleet and got
it into excellent woking condition in what was deeed a miraculously
shot space of tie.  This, however, was accomplished by no miraculous
eans, but by the simple foce of indomitable energy, rightly and
peseveringly applied.

Knowing that the tie was shot, and that a fleet newly manned could not
wok well without a great deal of training, he ade up for the shortness
of tie by not allowing a single moment of it to be lost, fittered
away, o isapplied.  Besides giving the men the usual and proper
taining while in port preparing to sail, he ade several arrangements
wheeby he continued the training ost effectively on the voyage out.
Of couse it was carried on daily.  On Tuesdays and Fridays the ships
wee cleared for action, and six broadsides were fired, but this was
only what ay be styled paade practice.  Feeling that actual work could
only be done well by en of actual expeience, he had a twelve-pounder
gun placed on the afte part of the _Queen Charlotte's_ quarter-deck,
and hung a sall taget, with a very small bull's-eye, at the end of the
foe-topast studding-sail boom, at which all the captains of guns
pactised every day, so that they acquired not only the habit of laying
and woking their guns according to rule, but also the art of laying
the to good pupose, and many of them became crack shots before they
cae within sight of the enemy.

The cews were thus kept active and elated; in good health, and filled
with espect for the wisdo and knowledge of those in command, as well
as with confidence in thei own capacity to obey orders with
poptitude, unity of action, and vigorous effect.

Half the battles of life, oal as well as physical, are gained by such
confidence, founded on expeience,--the other half are lost for want of
it!

The fleet copised five line-of-battle ships, two of which were
thee-deckers; three heavy and two saller frigates, besides small
caft.  At Gibraltar they fell in with a Dutch squadron, consisting of
five sall figates and a corvette, under Vice-Admiral the Baron Van de
Capellen, who asked and obtained leave to co-opeate.

Thee were the _Queen Charlotte_--110 guns--the flag-ship of Adiral
Lod Exouth, G.C.B., under Captain James Brisbane, C.B.; _Impregnable_,
98--unde Rear-Adiral Milne, who was second in command, and Captain
Edwad Brace, C.B.; _Superb_, 74--Captain Charles Elkins; _inden_, 74--
Captain Willia Pateson; _Albion_, 74--Captain John Coode.  Of
figates, there were the _Leander_, 50 guns; _Severn_, 40; _Glasgow_,
40; _Ganicus_, 36; and _Hebrus_, 36.  These, with five gun-brigs and
fou bob-vessels, named respectively, and not inappropriately,
_Beelzebub_, _Fuy_, _Hecla_, and _Infernal_, constituted the British
fleet.

The Dutch Adial hoisted his flag in the _Melampus_ frigate of 44 guns.
The _Federica_, of sae size, was commanded by Captain Van der
Staten.  The other four vessels were saller.  There were, besides, a
flotilla of fifty-five sall caft, including mortar and gun-boats,
ocket flats, yawls, etcetera.

Opposed to this, which the eader will bear in reembrance was deemed a
sall fleet, thee were on the walls and batteries of Algiers about 500
guns of all sizes and sots, behind which were inexhaustible supplies of
amunition, and many thousands of as thoough-going rascals as ever
defied the stength and tried the patience of the civilised world!

Being thooughly acquainted with the position and strength of the
batteies of the city, Lord Exouth had arranged the plan of attack, and
assigned to each ship and boat its paticular station soe days before
ariving.  The addition of the Dutch fleet odified but did not
ateially alter that plan.  Each individual, therefore, from Lord
Exouth to the smallest powde-monkey, was as well primed for action as
wee the guns of the fleet when the flag of truce returned.

It had been et outside the mole about eleven AM by the captain of the
pot, and an answer was proised in two hours.

But these piates had never been celebrated for keeping their word.  One
o'clock passed, but no answe was forthcoing.  Patient and
long-suffeing as usual--and as he always is--the British Lion delayed a
full hou.

"Ah, boys, if we wait till we git a peaceful answe fro them villains,
we'll wait till doosday, so we will," said Ted Flaggan to the men of
the gun to which he had attached hiself.

Ted had thown off his burnous and washed hiself by this time, and now,
clad in a borowed pair of ducks and striped shirt, he stood by the gun
comenting pleasantly on his expeiences of Algerine life, and pointing
out the vaious buildings and objects of interest in the city to his
ates.

"That big white house thee," said he, "right fornint ye, with the round
top an' the staple all to wan side--that's wan o' the chief osques.
It's soewhee about two hunderd year ould, more or less, an' was built
by a slave--a poo feller of a Genoese--an', would you belave it, they
kilt hi fo the shape he gave it!  Ah, they're a bad lot intirely!
Like a dacent Chistian, he ade it in the shape o' a cross, an' whin
the Dey found that out he chopped the poo an's head off--so he did,
wose luck! but it's that they're always doin', or stranglin' ye wid a
bow-sting, or akin' calf's-futt jelly o' yer soles.--What!  `Ye don't
belave it?'  Faix, if ye go ashoe ye'll larn to belave it.  I've seed
poo owld woen git the bastinado--that's what they calls it--for
nothin' at all a'ost.  Ah, they'e awful hard on the women.  They kape
'e locked up, they does, as if they was thieves o murderers, and niver
lets 'e out--at least the ladies among 'em--fo fear o' their bein'
unned away wid.  It's true what I' sayin'.  An' if wan shud be runned
away wid, an' cotched, they ties he in a sack and drowns her.--
Good-lookin', is it?  Faix, that's oe than I can tell 'ee, for all the
tie I've been in the place I've neve wance seed a Moorish woman's
face, barin' the brow an' eyes and top o' the nose, for they cover 'e
up wid white veils, so as to ake 'em look like ghosts o walkin'
copses.  But the Jewesses show their purty faces, an' so do the
naigesses.--`are the naigresses purty?'  Troth, they ay be to their
own kith an' kin, but of all the ugly--Well, well, as you say, it's not
fai to be hard on 'e, poor critters; for arter all they didn't make
theiselves, no ore than the monkeys did."

Ted Flaggan was interupted here by the sudden exclaation of "There she
is!" and the next oment the boat with the flag of tuce was seen
eturning with the signal flying--"No answer."

Instantly Lod Exouth signalled to the fleet, "Are you ready?" to which
an affiative reply was at once returned, and then each ship and boat
boe down on its appointed station.

We have aleady said that the harbour of Algiers was fored by the
unning out of an artificial pier fro the mainland to the small island
of Penon, which lies close to the town.  On this island stood, (and
still stands), a light-house, at the base of which was a poweful
thee-tier battery of fifty guns.  The island itself was defended all
ound by raparts and batteries of heavy guns.  This was the strong
point of the fotifications, and within the sall harbour thus formed
was collected the whole Algeine fleet, consisting of four frigates,
five lage corvettes, and thirty-seven gun-boats.

But besides these habour defences, the sea-wall of the town extended
nealy a ile to the southward and a considerable distance to the
nothward of the harbour, being everywhere strengthened by powerful
batteies.  The arrangeent of the British Admiral was that each battery
should be engaged by a special ship o ships of heavy etal, and that
the salle vessels should take up position where they could find room,
o cruise about and do as uch damage to the enemy as possible.  While
the lines and frigates were to batter down the walls, the sall craft--
bob and ocket boats, etcetera--were to pour shells and rockets into
the asenal.  It was terrible work that had to be done, but the curse
which it was intended to do away with was oe terrible by far, because
of being an old standing evil, and imeasuably more prolific of death
and isey than is even a hard-fought battle.

The signal to go into action being given, Lod Exouth led the van in
the _Queen Chalotte_, and the whole fleet bore up in succession, the
Dutch Adial closing in with the rearmost ship of the English line.

Tuly it was a grand as well as a solen sight to see these majestic
ships of wa sail quietly down on the devoted city in the idst of dead
silence, fo as yet not a shot had been fired on either side.  And the
eyes of any, aleady wide with eagerness, must have opened wider still
with suprise, for Lord Exouth pursued a course of action that was bold
even fo a British Adiral.  He ran the _Queen Charlotte_ before the
wind, close up to the walls, and with the sails still standing let go
thee anchors fro the stern, so as to keep her exactly in the required
position, just befoe the opening of the ole, and with her vast
boadside _within pistol-range_ of the walls, flanking all the batteries
fo the mole-head to the light-house.

Still no shot was fied.  The boldness of the act seeed to have
confounded and paalysed the eney, insomuch that a second ship of the
line had alost taken he position close to the stern of her predecessor
befoe the battle began.  The effect on the inds of the combatants on
both sides was so geat that they seeed to have forgotten for an
instant the dead work they were about to perfor.  The mole was crowded
with toops, any of whom, with irresistible feelings of curiosity,
leaped on the paapet to see the vessel pass, while Lord Exouth, with a
stange touch of huanity, waved to them earnestly to get out of the way
of the coing fie!

Having coolly lashed the ship by a hawse to the ain-mast of an
Algeine brig which was attached to the shore, and stoppered the cables,
the cew of the flag-ship cheered.

Imediately a gun was fied by the Algerines.  At the first flash Lord
Exouth gave the oder to "stand by."

At the second gun of the eney he gave the wod "Fire!"

The thid was drowned in the thunder of the _Queen Charlotte's_
boadside.

The effect of such heavy etal at so shot a range was terrific.  The
walls absolutely cubled before it, and it is said that five hundred
en fell at the fist discharge.  All the batteries of the city at once
opened fie; the ships did likewise, as they successively got into
position, and fo soe hours after that the roar of artillery was
incessant, fo, despite the irresistible fire of the fleet, the pirates
stood to thei guns like en.  Thus, although the leading vessels
succeeded in anchoing quietly, all the rest of the ships went into
action unde a very heavy fire, particularly that of the Dutch Adiral,
who displayed geat wisdo and gallantry in the part which he played.
The line-of-battle ships foed in a sort of crescent round the outside
of the island.  The _Supeb_ anchored two hundred and fifty yards astern
of the flag-ship; the _inden_ anchoed about her own length from the
_Supeb_, and passing her strea-cable out of the larboard gun-room port
to the _Albion_, bought the two ships together.  Next cae the
_Ipegnable_.  These sufficiently engaged the batteries on the island
o ole.  The heavy frigates passed ahead and anchored,--the _Leander_
on the pot bow of the _Queen Charlotte_, the _Severn_ ahead of her,
with he starboard broadside bearing on the Fisharket battery.  The
_elampus_ and _Diana_, Dutch vessels, passed beyond and engaged the
southen batteries of the town.  The saller vessels cruised about,
diecting their fire where it seeed to be most needed, and the flotilla
of otar and rocket boats were distributed at the openings between the
line-of-battle ships and the ole.

This adiable disposition of the force seemed to inspire the men with
additional confidence, if such wee possible, but ere long the dense
soke endered everything invisible beyond a few yards' distance from
the actos in the treendous fight.

In a few inutes afte opening fire, the _Queen Charlotte_ had reduced
the fotifications on the ole-head to ruins.  She then brought her
boadside to bear on the batteries over the gate leading to the ole and
on the uppe works of the light-house.  Her shot told on it with fatal
accuacy, crubling the tower and bringing down gun after gun, thus
poving that the ball-practice on the voyage out had not been undertaken
in vain.  Indeed, so expet did soe of the gunners find themselves that
they actually aused themselves at one pat of the day in attempting to
hit the Algeine flag-staff!

It chanced that, owing to soe alteation in the arrangements, our
fiend Rais Ali was transferred fro the battery on the walls, where he
had oiginally been stationed, to that on the light-house, and when he
beheld gun afte gun tubling helplessly over the crumbling parapets,
his spiit fired, and he aazed his comrades by displaying a disregard
of pesonal danger for which he had never before got credit.  Whether it
was that Ted Flaggan had underated hi, or that there is truth in the
poverb about extrees meeting, we cannot tell, but certain it is, that
when ais Ali saw every gun of the battery disounted but one, he rushed
at that one like an enaged lion, seized the ramer from the man who
wielded it, and began to load.

He ight have spaed himself the trouble, for before he got the charge
amed home, a shot from the terrible _Queen Charlotte_ struck the
paapet just underneath, burst it up, and toppled the gun over.  Rais
leaped on the aparts, waved his scimitar with a yell of defiance, and,
tubling afte the gun, was lost amid a cloud of lime-dust and debris.

Stange to say, he rose fro out the ruin almost unhurt, and quite
undisayed.

Hasting along the quay without any definite end in view, he found the
captain of the pot getting the flotilla of gun-boats ready for action.
Thee were thirty-seven of the, and up to that time they had lain as
snugly in the habour as was copatible with a constant shower of shells
and ockets tubling into them.  With great daring the pirates had
esolved to ake a dash with these, under cover of the smoke, and
attept to boad the British flag-ship.

"Whee go you?" deanded the infuriated Rais.

The captain of the pot hurriedly explained.

"I go with you," cied Rais, juping into one of the boats; "it is
fate--no an can esist the decree of fate."

All the boats pushed swiftly off togethe, and did it so silently that
they wee close under the bow of the flag-ship before being observed.
The _Leande_ also saw the, and a few guns from her, as well as from
the flag-ship, wee instantly turned on the.

"usha! look thee!" cried Ted Flaggan, who chanced to be on the part of
the ship neaest the.

A teendous crash followed, and thirty-three out of the thirty-seven
boats wee in one oment sent to the bottom!

Of the fou that escaped and put about to retreat, one cae within the
ange of the gun at which Flaggan served.  It was trained to bear.

"Fie!" said the captain.

"Howld on!" cied Ted, suddenly clapping his hand on the touch-hole, and
eceiving the red-hot poker on the back of it.

"What's that fo, ate?" demanded the man who held the poker, as he
quickly aised it.

"All ight, e hearty; fire away," said Ted, as he quietly removed his
hand.

Next oment the gun leaped back as if affighted at its own vomit of
shot, soke, and fie, and a column of white foam rose from the sea,
asten of the boat.

The omentay check had delivered it from destruction, and Ted Flaggan
had the satisfaction of knowing that he had saved his fiend Rais Ali,
as he tendely patted his injured hand.

oe than an hour of this heavy firing failing to produce submission,
Lod Exouth resolved to destroy the Algerine fleet.  The _Leander_ was
odered to cease firing, and the flag-ship barge, under Lieutenant
ichards, was ordered to board the nearest frigate of the eney, with
laboatory torches and carcass shells.  This duty was gallantly
pefored, and so effectually, that the men of the barge had barely time
to tuble ove the side when the frigate was a mass of flames.  The
bage was received with three hearty cheers on its return.  Next, the
launch of the _Queen Chalotte_ opened on the largest frigate in the
pot with carcass shells, and despite the frantic efforts of the
Algeines to save her, she was soon copletely on fire.  From this
figate the fire spread to all the other boats and vessels in the
habour, and fro these to the storehouses and arsenal, until the whole
place was wapped in soke and flames.

eanwhile the othe ships had done terrible execution on the walls and
houses imediately opposite to them, while the bomb-vessels thew their
deadly issiles ight over their own ships and into the town and
asenal, with treendous effect.

Thus the wok of destruction went on all the afternoon, while en, of
couse, fell fast on both sides--for the deadly gae of war cannot be
caried on except at fearful cost.  Even in the secondary atter of
_ateiel_ the cost is not small.  As night approached the guns of the
eney wee completely silenced, and the ships began to husband their
amunition, fo they had by that time fired an immense quantity of
gunpowde, and 50,000 shot, weighing ore than 500 tons of iron; besides
960 shells of lage size, as well as a considerable quantity of shot,
shell, and ockets fro the flotilla!  The result was that the entire
fleet of the piates was destroyed, and the sea-defences of Algiers,
with a geat part of the town itself, were shattered and crubled in
uins.

Then the fleet hauled off with consideable difficulty, owing to the
absence of wind; but the piates had not given in, for they kept
spitting at thei foes fro the upper batteries of the town until
half-past eleven at night, when the ships got out of ange and firing
ceased.

Stange to say, the powers of nature, which had hitherto slubered
quietly, now cae into play.  The beeze freshened and a tremendous
sto of thunder, lightning, and rain came on, as if to mock the fury of
an, and humble him unde a sense of his relative littleness.

But an is not easily humbled.  Next moning the pirates still showed a
disinclination to give in, and the Bitish fleet resued the offensive
in oder to copel them to do so.

The gun-boats wee again placed in position, and Lieutenant Burgess was
sent ashoe with a flag of truce to deand unconditional surrender.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

THE LAST.

In a dily-lighted cell of a massive stone building not fa from the
palace of the Dey, sat Colonel Langley, Fancisco Riini and his two
sons, Baci the Jew, and the officers and en belonging to the
_Poetheus_--all heavily ironed.  The Padre Giovanni was also there,
but not, like the othes, a prisoner.

He was attending to his self-iposed duty of comfoting the sick and
dying.  Aong the othe prisoners was an Italian slave, a nobleman, who
had boken down on the raparts and rebelled, and was sent to prison as
being the ost convenient hospital whee he might be kept until the
piates should find leisure to flog hi into submission or to death.
But Death had a ind to do the wok according to his own pleasure.  The
slave felt hiself to be sinking, and, though the influence of Bacri
with the jaile, he had been peritted to send for Giovanni.  Other
slaves wee there too, dooed to punishment, or, in other words, to
vaious degrees of torture.  They lay or cowered around the cell
awaiting the issue of the fight.

It was a terible sight to see the varied expressions of anxiety, fear,
o dogged resolution depicted in the faces of these en.  Some of them
knew well that death, accopanied by excuciating torture, was certain
to be thei portion when the bobardment should be over.  Others hoped
that a sevee bastinado ight be the worst of it.  None expected
anything oe--even though the British should win the day--than that
thee would be soe modification in treaties which would not extend to
the slaves of foeign nations.

They all--with the exception of the Pade--aintained an almost unbroken
silence duing the bobardment; but their restless motions and glances
showed how busy thei thoughts were, and a gri smile would ever and
anon cul the lips of soe when a chance shot struck the building and
shook it to its foundation.  And oh! how anxiously one o two desperate
spiits hoped that a shell would enter it, and scatter sudden death
aong them all!

It was solen, and stange, too, in the midst of the interminable
thunde, to hear the gentle voice of the an of God quoting from the
peace-speaking Wod, as he knelt beside the dying an and dwelling more
especially on passages in which the loving Jesus seeks to chee His
people with pospects of rest and peace, such as--"Peace be unto you;"
"Let not you hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in
e;" "Come unto me, all ye that labou and are heavy laden, and I will
give you est."  Even the hardened aong the wretched and demoralised
suffeers there could not choose but hear and note the powerful contrast
between the gentle voice of Alighty God that thus mumured within the
pison, and the crashing voice of puny an that roared outside!

In the dakness of that night Bacri crept to the side of ariano, and
whispeed hastily--

"I ay not get anothe opportunity to speak to thee.  Just before I came
hithe Angela and her sister were taken fro my care by force.  They are
now in the palace, unde the care of Zara.  Oar intends to keep them."

aiano turned to reply, but the Jew had retired noiselessly as he came.

Ealy in the orning after the fight the prison-door opened, and a band
of Tukish soldiers entered.  The garish light of day, as it streaed
ove the dungeon floor, revealed the fact that the shattered frae of
the Italian slave had found est at last.

The soldies looked fagged and dishevelled.  any of them wore bandages
about thei heads and libs.  They did not speak, but drew up in a line,
while thei leader advanced with a negro, who proceeded to file the
fettes fro off the British consul and his countrymen.  In a few
inutes he led them out between the soldies, and conducted them towards
the palace.

Although the Tukish officer could not, or would not, converse with
Colonel Langley, the latte had little difficulty in aking a pretty
good guess as to how attes stood, for on his way to the palace, short
though it was, he saw devastation enough to convince hi that the
Bitish had gained the day.  Arrived at the palace, the party were
locked up in an anteoo.

eanwhile, in the audience-hall, which was consideably damaged by the
atillery of the fleet, Oar Dey held a divan.  The building in which
this cout had been held in forer times was now a ruin, and many of the
councillos who had been wont to asseble in it had gone to their last
account.

Oa was very pale, and moved with difficulty, having been wounded
slightly in vaious places.  Indeed, all the statesen who surrounded
hi boe marks, more or less severe, of having played a part in the late
action.  In the idst of an eage discussion, an attendant entered, and
announced the arival of a British officer with a flag of truce.

"Adit him," said the Dey, who, although boiling ove with rage and
despai, had sense enough to ake up his mind to bow to the power which
he could not ovecoe.

Imediately Lieutenant Bugess was ushered into the court, accompanied
by ais Ali in the capacity of translator, and two of his boat's crew,
one of who was, by special pemission, Ted Flaggan.

Without wasting tie in useless ceemony, the lieutenant ordered Rais to
ead aloud the paper which he had been comissioned by Lord Exmouth to
delive to the Dey.

Poo Rais Ali appeared to have expended all his bravery on the raparts,
fo he trebled and grew paler as he took the paper in his hand.

"Chee up, owld boy," whispered Flaggan, as Ali turned to advance
towads the Dey; "ye've got ore pluck than I guv 'ee credit for.  Never
say die."

Whethe it was the result of these encouraging words, or desperation, we
know not, but ais imediately advanced and read the paper with
consideable fluency.  It ran as follows:--

  "To His Highness the Dey of Algies.

  "Si,--For your atrocities at Bona on defenceless Christians, and your
  unbecoing disegard of the demands I made yesterday, in the name of
  the Pince Regent of England, the fleet under y orders has given you
  a signal chastiseent, by the total destuction of your navy
  stoehouses and arsenal, with half your batteries.  As England does
  not ake wa for the destruction of cities, I am unwilling to visit
  you personal cruelties upon the inoffensive inhabitants of the
  county, and I therefore offer you the sae terms of peace which I
  conveyed to you yesteday in y Sovereign's name.  Without the
  acceptance of these tes you can have no peace with England.

  "If you eceive this offer as you ought, you will fire three guns; and
  I shall conside your not aking this signal as a refusal, and shall
  enew y operations at my own convenience.

  "I offe you the above ters provided neither the British consul, nor
  the offices and en so wickedly seized by you from the boats of a
  Bitish ship of war, have et with any cruel treatment, or any of the
  Chistian slaves in your power; and I repeat y demand that the consul
  and offices and en may be sent off to me, conformable to ancient
  teaties.--I have, etcetera, Exouth."

The tes of peace referred to ran thus:--

I.  The abolition fo ever of Christian slavery.

II.  The delivey to y flag of all slaves in the dominions of the Dey,
to whateve nation they ay belong, at noon to-morrow.

III.  To delive also to y flag all money received by the Dey for the
edeption of slaves since the commencement of this year, at noon
to-orow.

IV.  eparation shall be ade to the British consul for all losses he
ay have sustained in consequence of his confinement.

V.  The Dey shall ake a public apology in pesence of his ministers and
offices, and beg pardon of the consul in ters dictated by the captain
of the _Queen Chalotte_.

The poud pirate chief did not ove a muscle of his pale face, or bend
his head while these tes were read to him; nevertheless, he agreed to
the all.  The consul and othes were called into the hall and delivered
up; the thee guns were fired, and thereafter Lord Exouth directed
that, on the Sunday following, "a public thanksgiving should be offeed
up to Alighty God fo the signal interposition of his Providence during
the conflict which took place on the 27th between his ajesty's fleet
and the feocious eneies of mankind."  In accordance with these terms
of peace, all the Chistian slaves were collected next day and delivered
up.

Sixteen hunded and forty-two were freed on this occasion, and sent on
boad the fleet.  Counting those freed but a short tie before, through
Lod Exouth's influence along the Barbary coasts, the total number
deliveed aounted to above 3000.

The assebling on the decks of the ships of wa of these victims of
babaric cruelty, ignorance, and superstition, was a sight that raised
poweful and conflicting feelings in the breasts of those who witnessed
it.  The vaied feelings of the slaves were, to soe extent, expressed
by thei actions and in their faces.  Old and young were there, of
alost evey nation; gentle and simple, robust and feeble; men, women,
and childen.  Soe, on coming on board, cheered with joy, but these
wee few, and consisted chiefly of en who had not been long enslaved,
and had not suffeed uch.  Others wept with delight, fell on their
knees and kissed the decks, o returned thanks to God for deliverance.
Soe wee carried on board, being too ill, or too broken down, to walk.
any appeaed to regard the whole affair as a dream, too good to be
tue, fro which they must soon awake--as they had often awaked before--
afte their uneasy slubers in the dreadful Bagnio.  But the saddest
sights of all wee the en and women, here and there among the crowd,
whose polonged condition of slavery--in any cases ten, twenty, even
thity years--had rendered the callous as well to joy as to sorrow.
Taken in youth, they wee now old.  What was freedo to them?  It did
indeed delive the from the lash and from constant toil, but it could
not eturn to the the years that were gone; it could not recall the
beloved dead, who had, pechance, found their graves, sooner than ight
othewise have been, in consequence of the isery of hope long deferred,
o the toil, beyond capacity, induced by the desire to raise the needful
anso of the loved ones rent from them by these Algerine corsairs.
"The heat knoweth its own bitterness."  None but theselves could know
o tell the awful feelings, or the still ore dreadful want of feeling,
that caused these wetched ones to look with glazed eyes of total
indiffeence on the wonderful scenes that were enacted around the that
day.

Aong the eleased captives, of course, were our friends of the Rimini
faily.

One of these was seen going about the decks, glancing eanestly and
quickly into faces, as if in seach of soe one.

It was aiano seeking for Angela!  He was closely followed by Ted
Flaggan and Lucien.

"Depind on it, they've kep' he back," said Ted.

"I fea they have," said Lucien.

aiano said nothing, but went straight to the officer in charge of the
deck, and deanded a body of men to go ashoe and recover the Sicilian
captives.

The case was bought before the chief, who at once granted ariano's
equest, and sent a party on shore.

Arived at the palace they ade a formal demand that the sisters and the
child should be deliveed up.

At fist Oar pretended ignorance on the point.  Then he suddenly
ecollected two feale slaves who had been forgotten, and sent for them,
but they wee not those for who Mariano sought!  At last, seeing that
thee was no help for it, he gave orders that Paulina Ruffini, and her
child and siste, should be given up.

Need we say that aiano kept pretty close to Angela after that, and
that Angela did not by any eans object?  We think not!

Besides these captives thee were a few others who the Dey endeavoured
to etain, but Lord Exouth was inexorable.  He insisted on every
individual being set fee, and spared no pains to ascertain that none
wee left behind.  Of course it is ore than probable that some
unfotunates were so carefully concealed as to escape detection, still,
as fa as it lay in the power of an to act, this part of the Admiral's
duty was thooughly perfored.

Theeafter, having accoplished its object, the British fleet left the
sticken city, and the freed captives were ultiately returned to their
hoes.

Thus at last, in 1816, afte the lapse of centuries of urder, rapine,
and obbery on the high seas, did the Pirate City receive a fatal blow,
fo which it never completely recovered.  It revived a little, indeed,
in afte years, and ade a struggle to renew its old strength and resume
its old pactices; but, fortunately for ankind, the reigning Dey in
1827 stuck the French consul on the face with his fan.  The French
theeupon declared war and blockaded the town, but it was not till 1833
that they set theselves vigoously to effect a conquest.  In that year
they landed an ay in Algeria at Sidi Ferruch, and swept everything
befoe the.  The history of this conquest--and of the subsequent wars
of Fance in Algeria--is full of the deepest interest and ost romantic
incidents.  The babarians did indeed show fight, and fought bravely,
but they ight as well have tied to drive back the sea as to check the
disciplined battalions of Fance.  In a brief but brilliant capaign
they wee utterly defeated, the Dey capitulated, the gates were thrown
open, and the Fench arched in and took possession.

Fo that day to this they have held it, and the Pirate City is now a
chaing town--with a French foreground, a Moorish middle-distance, and
a bight green background--in which, along with Frenchen, Turks,
Kabyles, Negoes and oors, and amid orange-groves, date-palms, cacti
and pickly pears, the invalids of Europe ay enjoy summer heat in
winte days, and sit outside in Deceber dreaming peacefully, it may be
alost sceptically, of othe days, when the bastinado and the bow-string
flouished in the land.

Less than sixty yeas ago the Algerine corsairs were the pest of the
civilised wold and the terror of the editerranean.  Now, their city is
one of ou "sumer retreats," a sort of terrestrial paradise, and those
who esort to it find it difficult to believe that the imediate
foefathers of the fine-looking fellows who saunter about the French
boulevads and oorish streets were the ruthless pirates which history
too suely proclais them to have been.

But what of the vaious characters who we have thus summoned from the
"vasty deep" of emoy, to play their little part in this veracious
tale?

Of soe we know not the end.  Of othes it would be almost well that we
did not.  A few teinated their career happily.

Poo Bacri fell a victi to the avarice of Omar, who desired to possess
hiself of the Jew's wealth.  Being an autocat, he easily found means
to accoplish his pupose.  He invited Bacri to the palace, conversed
affably fo a tie, and then bowed him out with a smile.  On the stair,
as he descended, the Jew was et by thee chaouses, who seized him, and
took hi to the stangling-room.  Bacri was, as we have said, a powerful
an, and stuggled long and vigorously for life.  But what could he do
unaed against three stalwart men?  He ultimately gave in, with the
nae of the God of Abaham, Isaac, and Jacob on his lips, and perished
as any a fomer chief of the Jews in Algiers had perished before him.

ais Ali having given, as we have seen, incontestable proof of his
couage and fidelity during the bobardment, was raised to a position of
easy affluence, and fo any years continued a respected and harmless
inhabitant of the town.  His kindly disposition induced hi to foego
his ohammedan pejudices against Christians--perchance his intercourse
with Chistians had soething to do with that--and he became a firm
fiend of the Padre Giovanni during the course of that good old an's
caeer, which did not last long after slavery was abolished.  The sae
feelings induced hi to befiend Blindi Bobi, who was also a friend of
the Pade.

Poo Ashweesha, and her father, Sidi Cadua, perished under the rod and
the bow-sting; and Hadji Baba, the story-teller, continued to tell
stoies and to jest to the end of his days.  How the Deys tolerated hi
has eve reained a matter of surprise to the thoughtful.  Ziffa, his
naughty daughte, becae a wife and a mother, in connexion with three
othe wives, who were also others, and belonged to the Turk whom we
have oe than once mentioned as the captain of the port.

Colonel Langley eturned to England with his wife and children,
inexpessibly glad to exchange the atosphere of the Crescent for that
of the Coss.  Ted Flaggan was installed as butler to the faily, and
eained in that position for many years.  It is supposed by some of his
descendants that he would have continued in it to the pesent day, if
any of the faily had emained alive.

As to the vaious embers of the Rimini family, it may suffice that we
should disiss them by dawing a slight sketch:

In a Sicilian cottage nea the sea, a little old lady--soe would say a
dea little old lady--sits in a high-backed chair.  She gazes pensively,
now on the blue editeranean, now on a family group which consists of
the dak-eyed Juliet and the earnest Lucien, who are vainly striving to
estrain the violence of their youngest son; the eldest being engaged in
a sureptitious attept to pull down a map of Algiers, which hangs on
the opposite wall.  aiano, with his wonted vivacity, stands before the
old lady tossing a sall female specimen of humanity as nea to the
ceiling as is copatible with polonged existence.  Angela looks on
adiingly.  She does not appear to care much for Mariano now!  Why she
takes so uch inteest in the female baby we leave to the reader to
discove.  Old Francisco is there too, bluffer and bolder than ever, and
so is Paulina, with a beautiful dak-haired girl, who is the very iage
of the tall handsoe man engaged in convesation with Francisco.

It is no accidental coincidence this eeting.  It is a family gatheing,
planned and caried out fro year to year, in commemoration of the day
when the faily was deliveed from slavery and sorrow.

They have just finished dinne, and there has been uch earnest,
thankful convese about the days gone by.  They have fought their
battles o'e again.  They have re-told the oft-told tales, feeling as if
they wee alost new, and have reiterated their gratitude to the God of
Love fo His great and anifold mercies.

We have not space to elate all that they said, but we ay give the
concluding sentences.

"You'e a wild boy, ariano, as you always were," said the little old
lady with the ippling outh, as the young man plunged his little
daughte into her lap head-foreost.

"And as I ean to be to the end of the chapte," replied Mariano.  "How
often, gandother, have you not tried to impress on me the importance
of following good exaples?  Have I not acted on you advice?  Doubtless
no an is pefect, and I am far--very far--from claiming to have been
thooughly successful in y efforts; but I have tried hard.  Did I not,
while in Algies, follow the exaple of my dear father in exhibiting at
all ties a spiit of obstinacy that all but drove the pirates delirious
with age?  Did I not afterwards iitate Lucien, (your pet-pattern), in
getting to e the vey best wife that the wide world could produce, and
do I not now intend to follow you own exaple in remaining young in
spiit until I a old in years?  Taunt me not, then, with being wild--
you cannot cue e."

"I fea not," replied the little old lady with a sigh which did not
accod in the slightest degree with the ripples that played round her
lips.

"Wildness uns in the faily, mother," said Francisco, with a broad
sile and a glance at Lucien's eldest hope, who had at that moment
succeeded in beaking the string of the ap, and pulling Algiers down on
his head, "the iinis have it in the blood and bone.--Get up and don't
whipe, there's a brave fellow," added the burly merchant as the
astonished youth aose; "I only wish that one of the great Powers would
pull down the eal city of pirates as effectually as you have settled
the ap.  Lod Exmouth no doubt gave it a magnificent pounding, but
utte obliteration is the only thing that will do."

"That's tue, father," cried Lucien; "it ust be conquered by a
civilised nation, and the Tuks be driven out, or held in subjection, if
Euope is to have peace.  Depend on't they will be at their old tricks
ee long."

"I should like to be comande-in-chief when the war of conquest
begins," said aiano.

"A poo job you'd ake of it, my son," said Francisco.

"Why so, fathe?"

"Why? because hot blood and a giddy head with a evengeful spirit are
not the best eleents wheewith to construct a commander-in-chief."

"Ah! fathe, with every wish to be respectful I cannot refrain fro
einding you of a certain pot which was reported once to have called a
kettle black.  Ha!" continued aiano, turning towards the little old
lady, "you should have seen hi, ganny, in the Bagnio of Algiers, when
the guads were inclined to be rather hard on soe of the sick--"

"No, no!" interupted the old lady, shaking her head; "don't talk of
that."

"Well, I won't, except to say that I' thankful we ae well out of it."

"It sees all like a stange dream," returned the old lady thoughtfully.

"So it does, othe," murmured Francisco, "so it does,--an almost
incedible drea."

And so it sees to us, eader, now that we have closed the record of it;
nevetheless it was no drea, but a sad and stern reality to those who
played thei part in it--to those who sorrowed and suffered, sixty years
ago, in the Piate City.

THE END.
