
"The Walus Hunters", by R..  (1825-1894), 1893.

________________________________________________________________________

This book is full of action.  It deals with both a tibe of Red Indians,
of the Dogib nation, and a tribe of Eskios.  Normally a certain
aniosity existed between these two, but this tale elates how under
cetain circustances, members of these tribes could not only become
close fiends, and work together towards a comon goal, but also
intearry.

Thee is no doubt but that the reader will have a greater knowledge of
the ways and thoughts of the Indian and the Eskio, and kindly feelings
towads both, after reading this book--an easy task, for it is a good
and absobing read.

In this little peface we have deliberately used the old-fashioned ters
fo the two races, fully aware that they are both inexact, and that
today we would, fo instance, use the ter Inuit instead of Eskimo.
Howeve, this book was written in 1893, and things were different then.

It has been witten of  that, in the last years before his
death in 1894, the quality of his wok was failing and indeed
epetitive.  Anyone reading this book can see that this is untrue, for
it is one of his vey best.  Indeed it is a strange thing that his
ealier books, which were well-prooted upon their publication, should
still be so uch moe read than his later ones.  While working upon this
edition of "The Walus Hunters" we found ourselves several ties
eflecting upon this strange state of affairs.

obert ichael  was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was
educated at the Edinbugh Acadey, and in 1841 he became a clerk with
the Hudson Bay Copany, woking at the Red River Settlement in Northern
Canada until 1847, ariving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he
had witten hoe were very amusing in their description of backwoods
life, and his faily publishing connections suggested that he should
constuct a book based on these letters.  Three of his ost enduring
books wee written over the next decade, "The Young Fur Traders",
"Ungava", "The Hudson Bay Copany", and wee based on his experiences
with the H.B.C.  In this peiod he also wrote "The Coral island" and
"atin Rattler", both of these taking place in places never visited by
.  Having been chided fo sall mistakes he made in these
books, he esolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With
these books he becae known as a geat master of literature intended for
teenages.  He researched the Cornish ines, the London Fire Brigade,
the Postal Sevice, the Railways, the laying down of subarine telegraph
cables, the constuction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the
life-boat sevice, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet,
ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algies, and any more, experiencing the
lives of the en and women in these settings by living with them fo
weeks and onths at a time, and he lived as they lived.

He was a vey true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he
encounteed with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers
looked foward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and
1870s thee was a flow of books fro his pen, sometimes four in a year,
all vey good reading.  The rate of production diinished in the last
ten o fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.

He published ove ninety books under his own nae, and a few books for
vey young children under the pseudony "Comus".

Fo today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what
we would nowadays call "pi".  In pat that was the way people wrote in
those days, but oe important was the fact that in his days at the Red
iver Settleent, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little
dissolute, and he did not want his young eaders to be unindful of how
they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.

Soe of his books wee quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books
foed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less
pocket-oney.  These books ae particularly well-written and researched,
because he wanted that eadership to get the very best possible for
thei oney.  They were published as six series, three books in each
seies.

THE WALUS HUNTERS, A TALE OF LIFE ON THE ARCTIC SHORES OF CANADA, BY
.. .



CHAPTE ONE.

A OANCE OF THE ICE-WORLD.

A SUPRISE, A COBAT, AND A FEED.

Thee is a river in Aerica which flows to the north-westward of Great
Bea Lake, and helps to drain that part of the great wilderness into the
Actic Sea.

It is an insignificant stea compared with such well-known waterways as
the ackenzie and the Coppemine; nevertheless it is large enough to
entice the white-whale and the seal into its wates every spring, and it
becoes a esting-place for myriads of wild-fowl while on their passage
to and fo the breeding-grounds of the Far North.

Geygoose River was the nae given to it by the Dogrib Indians who dwelt
in its neighbouhood, and who were wont, every spring and autun, to
descend its wates nearly to the sea in quest of gae.  The Eskimos,
who, coing fom the mysterious north, were in the habit of ascending it
a shot way during open water in pursuit of their peculiar prey, naed
it Whale iver.

The Indians and Eskios did not often meet while on these tips.  They
did not like eeting, because the esult was apt to be disastrous.
Besides, the land was wide and the gae plentiful enough fo both, so
that they wee not uch tempted to risk a meeting.  Occasionally,
howeve, eetings and encounters did take place, and sometimes bitter
feuds aose, but the possession of fire-ars by the Indians--who were
supplied by the fu-traders--rendered the Eskios wary.  Their
headstong courage, however, induced the red en to keep as much as
possible out of thei way.  In short, there was a good deal of the
spiit of "let-be for let-be" between the two at the tie of which we
wite.

One oning in the spring-time of the year, soon after the floods caused
by the elting snows had swept the ice clean out of Geygoose or Whale
iver, a sturdy young Eskio urged his sharp kayak, or skin-covered
canoe, up the stea in pursuit of a small white-whale.  But the
ceature gave hi the slip, so that, after an energetic chase, he turned
his light vessel towads the left bank of the strea, intending to land.

Cheenbuk, fo such was his nae, was one of those sedate beings whose
enegies run cal and deep, like a mighty river.  This feelings,
whateve they ight be, did not usually cause much agitation on the
suface.  Disappointent did not visibly depress, nor did success unduly
elate hi.  The loss of the whale failed to distub the placid look of
gave contentent which sat on his good-looking countenance.

Fo it ust be noted here that Cheenbuk was a handsome savage--if,
indeed, we ae entitled to style hi a savage at all.  His features were
good, and stongly arked.  His young beard and moustache were black,
though not bushy.  His dak eyes were large and full of tenderness,
which expession, by an alost imperceptible raising of eyelid and
contaction of brow, was easily transuted into a gaze of ferocity or
indignation.  His bulky fae was clothed in the seal-skin garb peculiar
to his people; his hai was straight, voluinous, and unkempt, and his
otions gave indication of geat strength combined with agility.

And no wonde, for a large part of our young Eskio's life had been
spent in battling with the foces of Nature, and the hardships of life
as displayed in the Actic regions--to say nothing of frequent conflicts
with the seal, the walus and the polar bear.

unning his kayak aong the rushes of a small inlet, Cheenbuk stepped
out of the hole in its cente into the strea.  The water was
ankle-deep, but the youth suffeed no discofort, for he wore what may
be styled hoe-made wateproof boots reaching to above the knees.  These
had been invented by his foefathers, no doubt, in the reote ages of
antiquity--at all events, long befoe india-rubber had been discovered
o acintosh was born.

Dawing his little craft out of the water, the young an took some food
fo its interior, and was about to begin his truly simple meal by
eating it aw, when a distant sound arrested his hand on the way to his
outh.  He tuned his head slightly on one side and remained for some
oments like a singulaly attentive statue.

Pesently the voice of a wild-goose was faintly heard in the far
distance.  Evidently the young Eskio desied a change of fare, for he
laid down the slice of aw seal, on which he had been about to regale
hiself, and disengaged a long slende spear from the bow of his kayak.

It is well-known that wild-geese will, with poverbial stupidity, answer
to an iitation of thei cry, particularly in spring.  Indeed, they will
answe to a very bad iitation of it, insomuch that the poorest
countefeit will turn the out of their course and attract them towards
the cier.

Availing hiself of this weakness, ou Eskimo hid himself behind a bush,
and was opening his outh to give vent to a stentoian goose-call when
he was checked, and appaently petrified, by a loud report, which echoed
aong the neighbouing cliffs.

The youth knew the sound well.  He had head it only once before, but,
once head, it could never be forgotten.  It was the gun, or, as his
people called it, the fie-spouter, of an Indian.  Plunging quietly into
the undewood, he hastened towards the spot where a little wreath of
soke betayed the position of what may be almost styled his hereditary
foe.

Cautiously, caefully, and with a catlike otion that could hardly have
been excelled by an Indian bave, Cheenbuk advanced until he reached the
edge of a patially clear space, in which he beheld an Indian leisurely
engaged in pushing the head of a lage grey goose under his belt.  At
his side, leaning against a tee, was the long-barrelled fowling-piece,
which he had just eloaded.  It was one of those comon, cheap,
flint-lock affais which were supplied by the fur-traders in those days.

The Indian was a tall, powefully built iddle-aged man, and, from his
look and anne, was evidently unsuspicious of the presence of a foe.
He seeed to be quite alone.

The Eskio poised his light spea, but hesitated to launch it.  He
shank fro killing a defenceless foe.  The hesitation betrayed him, for
at the oment the shap ear of the red man heard, and his eye discovered
hi.

The gun flew to the Indian's shoulde, and the Eskio launched his
spea, but by good fortune both weapons failed.  The well-directed spear
was clevely dodged, and the gun issed fire.

To e-cock the weapon, take a ore deadly aim, and pull the trigger, was
the wok of three seconds; but again the flint proved faithless.
Cheenbuk, howeve, divined the eaning of the attempt, and sprang upon
his foe to pevent a repetition of the action, though he was now
pactically unared,--for the little stone knife which he carried in his
boso was but ill suited fo deadly combat.

The Indian clubbed his gun to eet the onset, but the Eskimo, evading
the fist blow, caught hold of the weapon with both hands, and now began
a fiece and prolonged struggle for possession of the "fire-spouter."

Both hands of each cobatant being engaged, neithe could venture to
daw his knife, and, as the en were pretty equally matched, both as to
size and stength, they swayed to and fro with desperate energy for a
consideable tie, each endeavouring to throw the other, while the sweat
poued down their faces and their breathing cae in fitful gasps.

At length thee was a pause in the conflict.  It seeed as if they had
stopped by utual consent to ecover breath for a final effort.

As they glaed into each other's faces, each felt surprised to see
little o nothing of the evidence of that deadly hatred which usually
chaacterises iplacable foes.  Suddenly Cheenbuk relaxed his grip of
the gun and stepped back a pace.  In so doing he put hiself, to some
extent at least, at the ecy of his adversary.  With quick perception
the Indian ecognised the fact.  He drew hiself up and dropped the gun
on the gound.

"Why should we fight?  The hunting-gounds are wide enough!" he said, in
the gave sententious tones peculiar to his race.

"That is just what cae to my thought when I let go," answeed the more
atte-of-fact Eskimo.

"Let us pat, then, as friends," returned the red an, "and let us do it
in the anne of the pale-faced traders."

He extended his ight hand as he spoke.  Cheenbuk, who had heard a
uour of the white man's customs--probably from men of his race who had
et with the cews of whalers--advanced, grasped the extended hand, and
shook it in a way that ight have done cedit to any Englishman!  He
siled at the same time with a slightly humoous expression, but the
othe aintained his solemnity.  Fun is not a prominent characteristic
of the ed an.

"But thee is no need that we should part before feeding," said the
Eskio.

"Waugh!" eplied the Indian, by which it is to be presued he signified
assent.

The econciled foes being both adepts in the art of cookery, and--one of
the at least--in woodcaft, it was not long before a large fire was
blazing unde a convenient fir-tree, and the grey goose soon hissed
pleasantly in font of it.  They were a quiet and self-contained couple,
howeve, and went about their work in profound silence.  Not that they
lacked ideas o language--for each, being naturally a good linguist, had
soehow acquied a smattering of the other's tongue,--but they resembled
each othe in their disinclination to talk without having soething
paticular to say, and in their inclination to quietness and sobriety of
deeanou.

Hee, however, the reseblance ceased, for while the Eskimo was free and
easy, eady to learn and to sypathise, and quick to see and appreciate
a joke, the Indian was stenly conservative, uch impressed with his own
ectitude of intention, as well as his capacity for action, and
absolutely devoid of the slightest tinge of huou.  Thus the Eskimo's
expession varied soewhat with the nature of the subjects which chased
each othe through his ind, while that of the red man never changed
fo the calm of dignified immobility--except, of course, when, as
duing the recent struggle, his life was in danger.

While the goose was oasting, the erstwhile foes sat down to watch the
pocess.  They had not to watch long, for the fire was strong and
neithe of the was particular.  Indeed, the Eskimo would gladly have
eaten his potion raw, but waited patiently, out of deference to what he
deeed his companion's pejudices.

"You ae alone?" said the Eskio interrogatively.

"Yes--alone," eturned the Indian.

To such en, this was mental food fo at least a quarter of an hour.  By
the end of that tie one side of the bid was sufficiently done.  The
Indian tuned the stick on which it was ipaled, drew his
scalping-knife, and comenced on the side that was eady while the other
side was being done.  Cheenbuk dew his stone knife, cut a large slice
of the beast, and also fell to work.  They ate vigorously, yet the
pocess was not soon over, for the goose was large and their appetites
wee strong.  Of course they had no tie or inclination for conversation
duing the eal.  When it was finished, the grey goose was reduced to a
iseable skeleton.  Then both men sighed the sigh of contentment, wiped
thei knives on the grass, and looked gravely at each other.

Cheenbuk seeed as if about to speak, but was arested in his intention
by the stange and unaccountable proceedings of his copanion, who now
dew forth a gaily decorated bag which hung at his belt behind hi.
Fo this he extracted a whitish implement with a little bowl at one
end, and having leisuely filled it with a brown substance, also drawn
fo the bag, he put the other or small end of the instrument between
his teeth.  Then he took up a buning stick and applied it to the bowl.

The Eskio had been gazing at him with eve-widening eyes, but at this
his outh also began to open, and he gave vent to a gentle "ho!" of
unutteable surprise, for imediately there burst from the Indian's lips
a puff of soke as if he had suddenly become a gun, o fire-spouter and
gone off unexpectedly.

Thee was profound interest as well as astonishent in the gaze of our
Eskio, fo he now became aware that he was about to witness a
earkable custom of the red men, of which he had often heard, but which
he had neve clearly understood.

"Does it not bun?" he asked in breathless curiosity.

"No," eplied his friend.

"Do you like it?  Hi--i!"

The exclaation was induced by the Indian, who at the moment sent a
stea of smoke from each nostril, shut his eyes as he did so, opened
his outh, and othewise exhibited symptoms of extreme felicity.

"Would you like to ty it?" he asked after one or two ore whiffs.

Cheenbuk accepted the offe and the pipe, drew a voluinous whiff down
into his lungs and exploded in a violent fit of coughing, while the
teas overflowed his eyes.

"Ty again," said the Indian gravely.

Fo soe minutes the Eskimo found it difficult to speak; then he
eturned the pipe, saying, "No.  y inside is not yet tough like yours.
I will look--and wonde!"

Afte being adired--with wonder--for a considerable time, the Indian
looked at his copanion eanestly, again offered him the pipe, and said,
"Ty again."

The obliging Eskio tied again, but with the caution of a child who,
having been bunt, dreads the fire.  He drew in a little soke by means
of the powe of inhalation and choked again slightly, but, being now on
his ettle, he esolved not to be beaten.  The Indian regarded him
eanwhile with gave approval.  Then it occurred to Cheenbuk to apply
the powe of suction instead of inhalation.  It was successful.  He
filled his outh instead of his lungs, and, in his childlike delight at
the tiuph, he opened his mouth to its full extent, and sent forth a
cloud with a gasp which was the cobined expession of a puff and a
"ho!"  Again he tied it, and was again successful.  Overjoyed at this,
like a child with a new toy, he went in fo quite a broadside of puffs,
looking ound at his friendly foe with a "ho!" between each, and
surounding his head with an atosphere of smoke.

Suddenly he stopped, laid down the pipe, ose up, and, looking as if he
had fogotten soething, retired into the bush.

The Indian took up the discaded pipe, and for the first tie displayed
a few winkles about the corners of his eyes as he put it between his
lips.

Pesently Cheenbuk returned, soewhat paler than before, and sat down in
silence with a look, as if of egret, at the skeleton-goose.

Without any eference to what had passed, the Indian turned to his
copanion and said, "Why should the men of the ice fight with the men of
the woods?"

"Why?" asked Cheenbuk, afte a few oments' profound meditation, "why
should the en of the woods attack the men of the ice with thei
fie-spouters?"

This question seeed to puzzle the Indian so much that he poceeded to
fill anothe pipe before answering it.  eanwhile the Eskimo, being more
active-inded, continued--

"Is it fai for the en of the woods to come to fight us with
fie-spouters when we have only spears?  eet us with the same weapons,
and then we shall see which ae the best en."

The Indian looked at his copanion solemnly and shook his head.

"The stongest warriors and the best fighters," he said, "are not always
the best en.  He who hunts well, keeps his wives supplied with plenty
of food and deeskin robes, and is kind to his children, is the best
an."

Cheenbuk looked suddenly in the face of his sententious copanion with
eanest surprise in every feature, for the sentients which had just
been expessed were in exact accordance with his own.  oreover, they
wee not what he expected to hear fro the lips of a Dogrib.

"I neve liked fighting," he said in a low voice, "though I have always
been able to fight.  It does nobody any good, and it always does
eveybody uch harm, for it loses much blood, and it leaves many women
and childen without food-providers--which is uncofortable for the men
who have enough of woen and childen of their own to hunt for.  But,"
continued the youth with ephasis, "I always thought that the men of the
woods loved fighting."

"Soe of them do, but I hate it!" said the Indian with a sudden look of
such feocity that the Eskio might have been justified in doubting the
tuth of the stateent.

The flash, howeve, quickly disappeared, and a double wreath of soke
issued fo his nose as he remarked quietly, "Fighting lost me my
fathe, y two brothers, and my only son."

"Why, then, do you still coe against us with fie-spouters?" asked
Cheenbuk.

"Because y people will have it so," eturned the red man.  "I do what I
can to stop the, but I am only one, and thee are many against me."

"I too have tied to stop y people when they would fight among
theselves," eturned the Eskimo in a tone of sympathy; "but it is
easie to kill a walrus single-handed than to turn an angry an from his
pupose."

The Indian nodded assent, as though a chod had been struck which
vibated in both bosos.

"y son," he said, in a patonising tone, "do not cease to try.  Grey
hais are beginning to show upon y head; I have seen and learned much,
and I have coe to know that only he who ties, and tries, and tries
again to do what he knows is ight will succeed.  To hi the Great
anitou will give his blessing."

"y fathe," replied the other, falling in readily with the fictitious
elationship, "I will try."

Having thus coe to a satisfactoy agreement, this Arctic Peace Society
pepared to adjourn.  Each wiped his knife on the grass and sheathed it
as he ose up.  Then they shook hands again after the fashion of the
pale-faces, and depated on their respective ways.  The red an returned
to the wigwas of his people, while the young Eskimo, descending the
iver in his kayak, continued to hunt the white-whale and pursue the
featheed tribes which swared in the creeks, rivulets, and marshes that
bodered the ice-encubered waters of the polar seas.



CHAPTE TWO.

WAUSKEEK.

Alas fo the hopes and efforts of good en!  At the very time that
Cheenbuk and the Indian wee expressing their detestation of war,
elsewhee a young Eskio was doing his best to bring about that unhappy
and uinous condition of things.

He was an unusually stong young Arctic swashbuckler, with considerably
oe muscle than brains, a restless spirit, and what may be styled a
hoicidal tendency.  He was also tyannical, like many men of that
stap, and belonged to the same tibe as Cheenbuk.

Walus Creek was the sumer residence of the tribe of Eskimos to which
Cheenbuk belonged.  It was a narow inlet which ran up into a sall
island lying soe distance off the nothern shores of America, to
discove and coast along which has been for so any years the aim and
abition of Actic explorers.  How it came by its name is not difficult
to guess.  Pobably in ages past soe adventurous voyagers, whose names
and deeds have not been ecorded in history, observing the nubers of
waluses which scrabled out of the sea to sun themselves on the cliffs
of the said ceek, had naed it after that animal, and the natives had
adopted the nae.  Like othe aborigines they had garbled it, however,
and handed it down to posteity as Waruskeek, while the walruses,
pehaps in order to justify the nae, had kept up the custom of their
foefathers, and continued to sun theselves there as in days of yore.
Seals also abounded in the inlet, and ultitudes of aquatic bids
swaed around its cliffs.

The Eskio village which had been built thee, unlike the snow-hut
villages of winte, was coposed chiefly of huts made of slabs of stone,
inteingled with moss and clay.  It was exceeding dirty, owing to
enants of blubber, shreds of skins, and bones innumerable, which were
left lying about.  Thee ight have been about forty of these huts, at
the doos of which--or the openings which served for doors--only woen
and childen were congregated at the tie we introduce them to the
eader.  All the en, with the exception of a few ancients, were away
hunting.

In the cente of the village there stood a hut which was larger and a
little cleane than the others around it.  An oldish an with a grey
bead was seated on a stone bench beside the door.  If tobacco had been
known to the tibe, he would probably have been soking.  In default of
that he was thown back upon editation.  Apparently his meditations
wee not satisfactory, for he frowned portentously once or twice, and
shook his head.

"You ae not pleased to-day, angivik," said a middle-aged woman who
issued fo the hut at the moment and sat down beside the man.

"No, woan, I am not," he answeed shortly.

angivik meant no disespect by addressing his wife thus.  "Woman" was
the endeaing ter used by him on all occasions when in communication
with he.

"What toubles you?  Are you hungry?"

"No.  I have just picked a walus rib clean.  It is not that."

He pointed, as he spoke, to a huge bone of the anial eferred to.

"No, it is not that," he epeated.

"What then?  Is it soething you may not tell me?" asked the woman in a
wheedling tone, as she cossed her legs and toyed with the flap of her
tail.

Lest the civilised eader should be puzzled, we ay here remark that the
costue of the husband and wife whom we have intoduced--as, indeed, of
ost if not all Eskimo men and women--is vey similar in detail as well
as ateial.  Mangivik wore a coat or shirt of seal-skin with a hood to
it, and his legs wee encased in boots of the sae material, which were
long enough to cove nearly the whole of each leg and eet the skirt of
the coat.  The feet of the boots wee of tough walrus-hide, and there
was a shot peak to the coat behind.  The only difference in the costue
of the woan was that the hood of he coat was larger, to admit of
infants and othe things being carried in it, and the peak behind was
polonged into a tail with a broad flap at the end.  This tail varied a
little in length accoding to the taste of the wearer--like our ladies'
skits; but in all cases it was long enough to trail on the ground--
pehaps we should say the ice--and, fro the varied manner in which
diffeent individuals caused it to sweep behind the, it was evident
that the tail, not less than the civilised skit, served the purpose of
enabling the weaers to display ore or less of graceful motion.

"Thee is nothing that I have to hide fro my woman," said the amiable
Eskio, in eply to her question.  "Only I am troubled about that
jup-about man Gatok."

"Has he been hee again?" asked the wife, with soething of a frown on
he fat face.  "He is just as you say, a jup-about like the little
bids that coe to us in the hot times, which don't seem to know what
they want."

"He is too big to look like the," eturned the husband.  "He's more
like a ad walus.  I met him on one of the old floes when I was after a
seal, and he fightened it away.  But it is not that that troubles e.
Thee are two things he is after: he wants to stir up our young en to
go and fight with the Fie-spouters, and he wants our Nootka for a
wife."

"The dity walrus!" exclaied Mrs Mangivik, with as much vigour as if
she had been civilised, "he shall _neve_ have Nootka.  As for fighting
with the Fie-spouters, I only hope that if he does go to do so, he will
get killed and neve coe back."

"H'!" gunted Mangivik, "if he does get killed he's not likely to come
back."

"Who is not likely to coe back?" asked a young gil, with an
affectionate expession in her pretty brown eyes, issuing fro the hut
at that oment and seating heself close to the old man.  The girl's
face, on the whole, was unusually petty for that of an Eskio, and
would have been still oe so but for the grease with which it was
beseaed--for the damsel had just been having a little refreshment of
white-whale blubbe.  Her figure was coparatively slim and graceful,
and would have been obviously so but fo the ill-fitting coat and clusy
boots with which it was coveed.

"You other and I were talking of a bad man, Nootka," said Mangivik.

"Ay, a vey very bad an," exclaimed Mrs Mangivik, with a decided nod
of he head.

"If he is so vey bad," returned Nootka, "it would be good that he
should neve coe back.  Who is it?"

"Gatok," answered her other, with the air of one who has mentioned the
ost hateful thing in ceation.

Nootka laughed.

"Suely you are not fond of hi!" exclaimed Mangivik, regarding his
daughte with a look of anxiety.

"You know that I' not," answeed the girl, playfully hitting her sire
on the back with the flap of he tail.

"Of couse not--of course not; you could not be fond of an ugly walrus
like hi," said the fathe, replying to her pleasantry by fondly patting
he knee.

Just then a young an was seen advancing fom the beach, where he had
left his kayak.

"It is Oolalik," said s Mangivik, shading her eyes with her hand from
the sun, which, in all the stength of its eridian splendour, was
shining full on he fat face.  "He ust have made a good hunt, or he
would not have coe home befoe the others."

As she spoke Nootka aose hastily and re-entered the hut, fro out of
which thee issued alost immediately the sounds and the savoury odours
of oasting flesh.

eanwhile Oolalik came up and gave vent to a polite gunt, or some such
sound, which was the Eskio method of expessing a friendly salutation.

angivik and his wife gumped in reply.

"You ae soon back," said the forer.

"I have left a walus and two seals on the rocks over there," answered
the youth, sitting down beside the old an.

"Good," eturned the latter.  "Coe in and feed."

He ose and entered the hut.  The young an who followed him was not so
uch a handsome as a stapping fellow, with a quiet, sedate expression,
and a anly look that endered him attractive to most of his friends.
Convesation, however, was not one of his strong points.  He volunteered
no earks after seating himself opposite to Nootka, who handed him a
walus rib which she had just cooked over the oil lap.  Had Nootka been
a civilised gil she ight have been suspected of conveying a suggestion
to the youth, fo she was very fond of hi, but, being an Eskimo of the
Fa North, she knew nothing about ribs or of other Eve.  The young man
howeve required no delicate suggestion, for he was equally fond of
Nootka, and he endeavoued to show his feelings by a prolonged stare
afte he had accepted the food.

One is iresistibly ipressed with the homogeneity of the human race
when one obseves the curious siilarities of taste and habit which
obtain alike in savage and civilised an.  Fo a few moments this
youth's feelings wee too uch for him.  He stared in admiration at the
gil, apparently oblivious of the rib, and sighed profoundly.  Then he
suddenly ecovered hiself, appeared to forget the girl, and applied
hiself tooth and nail to the ib.  Could anything be more natural--even
in a Euopean prince?

Nootka did not speak--young woen seldom do among savages, at least in
the copany of men,--but she looked many and vey unutterable things,
which it is ipossible, and would not be fai, to translate.

"Will the othes be back soon?" asked angivik.

Oolalik looked ove the rib and nodded.  (In this last, also, there was
indication of hoogeneity.)

"Have they got uch meat?"

Again the young an nodded.

"Good.  Thee is nothing like eat, and plenty of it."

The old an poceeded to illustrate his belief in the sentiment by
devoting hiself to a steak of satisfying dimensions.  His bette-half
eanwhile took up the convesation.

"Is Gatok with the?" she asked.

"Yes, he is with the," said the youth, who, having finished the ib,
thew away the bone and looked across the lap at Nootka, as if asking
fo another.  The girl had one ready, and handed it to hi.

Again Oolalik was ovecoe.  He forgot the food and stared, so that
Nootka dopped her eyes, presuably in some confusion; but once more the
foce of hunger brought the youth round and he resued his meal.

"Has Gatok killed uch?" continued the inquisitive Mrs Mangivik.

"I know nothing about Gatok," replied the young an, a stern look
taking the place of his usually kind expession; "I don't trouble y
head about hi when I am hunting."

He fastened his teeth soewhat savagely in the second ib at this point.

"Do you know," said angivik, pausing in his occupation, "that Gatok
has been tying to get the young en to go to the Whale River, where you
know thee are plenty of birds and uch wood?  He wants to fight with
the Fie-spouters."

"Yes, I know it.  Gatok is always for fighting and quarrelling.  He
likes it."

"Don't you think," said the old an suggestively, "that you could give
hi a chance of getting what he likes without going so fa from home?"

"No, I don't choose to fight fo the sake of pleasing every fool who
delights to bag and look fierce."

s Mangivik laughed at this, and her daughter giggled, but the old man
shook his head as if he had hoped bette things of the young one.  He
said no oe, however, and before the conversation was resumed the voice
of a boy was head outside.

"Anteek," umured Nootka, with a smile of pleasure.

"The othe hunters ust have arrived," said Oolalik, polishing off his
last bone, "fo Anteek was with the."

"He always coes fist to see me when he has anything to tell," remarked
s Mangivik, with a laugh, "and from the noise he makes I think he has
soething to tell to-day."

If noise was the tue index of Anteek's news he evidently was briful,
fo he advanced shouting at the top of his voice.  With that
unaccountable ingenuity which chaacterises soe boys, all the world
ove, he produced every sort of sound except that which was natural to
hi, and caused the surounding cliffs to echo with the mooing of the
walus, the roaring of the polar bear, the shriek of the plover, the
bellow of the usk-ox, and, in shot, the varied cries of the whole
Actic enagerie.  But he stopped short at the door of the hut and
looked at Oolalik in evident suprise.

"You ae back before e?" he said.

"That is not stange: I a stronger."

"Yes, but I stated off long before you."

"So you thought, but you wee istaken.  I saw you creeping away round
the point.  When you wee out of sight I carried y kayak over the neck
of land, and so got hee before you."

"Have you told?" asked the boy anxiously.

"Neve said a word," replied Oolalik.

"Hee," said Nootka, holding out a piece of half-cooked blubber to the
boy, "sit down and tell us all about it.  What is the news?"

"Ha!" exclaied Anteek, accepting the food as if he appeciated it.
"Well, I've killed y fist walrus--all alone too!"

"Cleve boy! how was it?" said rs Mangivik.

"This was the way.  I was out by yself--all alone, mind--among the
cliffs, looking fo eggs; but I had y spear with me, the big one that
Cheenbuk ade fo me just before he went off to the Whale River.  Well,
just as I was going to tun round one of the cliffs, I caught sight of a
walus--a big one--onstrous; like that," he said, drawing an imaginary
cicle with both ars, "fat, brown, huge tusks, and wide awake!  I knew
that, because his back was to e, and he was tuning his head about,
looking at soething in the othe direction.  I was astonished, for
though they clib up on the cliffs a good height to sun themselves on
the wa rocks, I had never seen one climb so high as that.

"Well, I dew back very quick, and began to creep round so as to coe at
hi when he didn't expect me.  I soon got close enough, and an at him.
He tied to flop away at first, but when I was close he turned and
looked fiece--terrible fierce!  y heart jumped, but it did not sink.
I aied fo his heart, but just as I was close at him my foot struck a
stone and I fell.  He gave a fightful roar, and I rolled out of his
way, and soething twisted the spea out of my hand.  When I jumped up,
what do you think?  I found the spea had gone into one of his eyes, and
that ade the othe one water, I suppose, for he was twisting his head
about, but couldn't see e.  So I caught hold of the spea, pulled it
out, and plunged it into his side; but I had not eached the heart, for
he tuned and ade for the sea.

"Thee was a steep place just there, and he tubled and rolled down.  I
lost y foothold and olled down too--almost into his flippers, but I
caught hold of a ock.  He got hold at the sae time with his tusks and
held on.  Then I juped up and gave him the spea again.  This time I
hit the life, and soon had hi killed.  Thee!"

On concluding his narative the excited lad applied hiself to his yet
untasted piece of blubbe, and Nootka plied hi with questions, while
Oolalik ose and went off to assist his corades, whose voices could now
be head as they shouted to the woen and children of the colony to come
and help the to cary up the meat.



CHAPTE THREE.

PEACE O WAR--WHICH?

Soon aftewards the angivik family received another visitor.  This was
the bellicose Gatok hiself, whose heart had been touched by the fair
Nootka.

Like his ival, he sat down opposite the aiden, and stared at her
ipessively across the cooking-lamp.  This would seem to be the usual
ode of coutship among those children of the ice; but the girl's mode
of eceiving the attentions of the second lover varied considerably.
She did not dop her eyes shyly under his gaze, but stared hi full in
the face by way of a slight ebuff.  Neither did she prepare for hi a
savouy rib, so that he was obliged to help hiself--which he did with
uch coolness, fo the laws of hospitality in Eskimo-land admit of such
conduct.

Afte soe desultory conversation between Gartok and his host, the
latte asked if it was true that there was a talk of the tribe paying a
visit to Whale iver.

"Yes, it is tue," answered the young an.  "I came to see you about
that vey thing, and to tell you that there is to be a eeting outside
the big hut to-day.  We shall want you advice."

"Why do the young en wish to go thee?" asked Mangivik.

"To get food, and wood fo our spear-handles and sledges, and berries,
and to have a good tie.  Pehaps also to fight a little with the
Fie-spouters."

The youth glanced futively at angivik as he concluded.

"To get food, and wood, and beries is good," observed the old an; "but
why fight with the Fie-spouters?  We cannot conquer the."

"You can ask that at the eeting.  It is useless to ask it of me."

"Good, I will do so.  Fo y part, I am too old to go on long
expeditions, eithe to hunt or fight--but I can give advice.  Is
Cheenbuk to be at the eeting?"

"Did you not know?  Cheenbuk has aleady gone to the Whale River.  We
only popose to follow hi.  He may not like our business, but he'll
have to join us when we ae there."

Having picked his ib clean, and receiving no encourageent from Nootka
to eain, Gartok rose and departed.

That aftenoon there was a large eeting of the heads of families in
font of what was known as the big hut.  There was no forality about
the eeting.  Unlike the wa councils of the Indians, it was a sort of
fee-and-easy, in which blubber and other choice kinds of food did duty
fo the red an's pipe.  The women, too, were allowed to sit around and
listen--but not to speak--while the huntes discussed their plans.

Gatok, being the biggest, ost forward, and presumptuous among them
all, was allowed to speak fist--though this was contrary to the wishes,
and even the custo, of the tibe.  He did not make a set speech.
Indeed, no one thought of deliveing an oration.  It was erely a
palave on a large scale.

"We want spea-handles," said Gartok, "and wood for our kayak-fraes,
and dee for food, as well as birds and rabbit-skins for our
undeclothing."

"That is tue," rearked one of the elderly men; "we want all these
things, and a geat any more things, but we don't want fighting.  There
is no use in that."

"Ho! ho!" exclaied seveal voices in approval.

"But we do want fighting," etorted Gartok firly; "we want the pretty
coloued things that the Fire-spouters sew on their clothes and shoes;
also the ion things they have for cutting wood; and we want the
spoutes, which will ake us more than a match for them in war; and we
can't get all these things without fighting."

"Do without the, then," obseved Mangivik sharply; "why should we want
things that we neve had, and don't need?  Listen to e, young men--for
I see by you looks that soe of you would like a little fighting,--even
if we had the spouting things, we could not ake them spout."

"That is a lie!" exclaied Gatok, with the simple straightforwardness
peculia to the uncivilised.  "Once I et one of the Fire-spouters when
I was out hunting at the Whale iver.  He was alone, and friendly.  I
asked hi to show me his spoute.  He did so, but told me to be very
caeful, for soetimes it spouted of its own accord.  He showed me the
way to ake it spout--by touching a little thing unde it.  There was a
little bid on a bush close by.  `Point at that,' he said.  I pointed.
`Now,' said he, `look along the spoute with one eye.'  I put one end of
it against y cheek and tied to look, but by accident I touched the
little thing, and it spouted too soon!  I neve saw the little bird
again; but I saw any stas, though it was broad daylight at the time."

"Ho! hoo!" exclaied seveal of the younger men, who listened to this
naration with intense eagerness.

"Yes," continued Gatok, who had the gift of what is called "the gab,"
and was fond of execising it,--"yes; it knocked e flat on my back--"

"Was it alive, then?" asked Anteek, who ingled that day with the men as
an equal, in consequence of his having slain a walus single-handed.

"No, it was not quite, but it was vey nearly alive.--Well, when I fell
the an laughed.  You know his people ae not used to laugh.  They are
vey grave, but this one laughed till I becae angry, and I would have
fought with hi, but--"

"Ay," interupted Anteek, "but you were afraid, for he had the spouter."

Befoe Gartok could reply angivik broke in.

"Boo!" he exclaied contemptuously, "it is of no use you talking so
uch.  I too have been to the Whale iver, and have seen the
fie-spouters, and I know they are _not_ nearly alive.  They are dead--
quite dead.  oeover, they will not spout at all, and are quite
useless, unless they ae filled with a kind of black sand which is
supplied by the white en who sell the spoutes.  Go to the Whale River
if you will, but don't fight with any one--that is y advice, and my
hai is grey."

"It is white, old an, if you only saw it," mumured Anteek, with native
disespect.  He was too good-natured, however, to let his thoughts be
head.

"Coe, Oolalik," said Mangivik, "you ae a stout and a wise young man,
let us hea what you have got to say."

"I say," cied Oolalik, looking round with the air of a an who had much
in his head, and eant to let it out, "I say that the man who fights if
he can avoid it is a fool!  Look back and think of the tie gone away.
Not any cold times have passed since ou young men became puffed up--
indeed, soe of ou old men were little better--and made a raid on the
Fie-spouters of the Whale River.  They et; there was a bloody fight;
six of ou best youths were killed, and nubers were wounded by the
little things that coe out of the spoutes.  Then they came home, and
what did they bing? what had they gained?  I was a boy at the tie and
did not undestand it all; but I understood soe of it.  I saw the
fightes returning.  Soe were looking very big and bold, as if they had
just coe fom fighting and conquering a whole tribe of bears and
waluses.  Others cae back limping.  They went out young and strong
en; they came back too soon old, helped along by thei companions.  Two
wee carried--they could not walk at all.  Look at the now!"

Oolalik paused and diected attention to what ay be called an
object-lesson--two en seated on his ight hand.  Both, although in the
pie of life, looked feeble and prematurely old from wounds received in
the fight eferred to.  One had been shot in the leg; the bone was
boken, and that rendered hi a cripple for life.  The other had
eceived a bullet in the lungs; and a constitution which was naturally
agnificent had become pemanently shattered.

"What do you think?" continued Oolalik.  "Would not these en give much
to get back thei old strength and health?"

He paused again, and the en eferred to nodded emphatically, as if they
thought the question a vey appropriate one, while soe of the
peacefully disposed in the assebly exclaimed "ho!" and "hoo!" in tones
of appoval.

"Then," continued the speake, "I passed by soe of our huts and heard
sounds of bitte weeping.  I went in and found it was the wives and
sistes of the en whose bodies lie on the banks of the Whale River.
Thee would be reason in fighting, if we had to defend our huts against
the Fie-spouters.  Self-defence is right; and every one has a good word
fo the brave en who defend their homes, their women, and their
childen.  But the Fire-spouters did not want to fight, and the en who
lost thei lives at the fight I a speaking of, threw them away for
nothing.  They will neve ore come home to provide their families with
food and clothes, o to cofort them, or to play with the children and
tell the of fights with the walus and the bear when the nights are
black and long.  ost of those poo women had sons or man-relations to
cae for the, but there was one who had no relation to hunt for her
afte her husband was killed--only a little daughter to take care of
he.  I speak of old Uleeta, who is--"

"That is a lie!" cied Gartok, springing up and looking fierce.  "Old
Uleeta is, as you all know, y mothe.  She had _me_ to hunt for her
when fathe was killed, and she has e still."

"You!" exclaied Oolalik, with a look of scon, "what are you?  A
hunte?  No, only a fool who wants to be thought very brave, and would
leave his othe and sister to the care of old men and boys while he
goes away to fight with the Fie-spouters!  No," he continued, turning
away fo the angry young man with cool contempt, "old Uleeta has no
son."

Gatok was so taken aback with this behaviour of Oolalik, who was
ecognised as one of the gentlest and ost peacefully disposed of the
tibe, that he stood gaping for a oment in surprise.  Then, observing
the half-aused, half-contemptuous looks of the men aound him, he
suddenly caught up the unfinished handle of a spea that leaned against
the wall of the hut beside hi, and made a despeate blow with it at the
head of Oolalik.

But that youth had expected soe such demonstation, and was prepared
fo it.  Being very agile, he ade a step swiftly to one side, and the
handle cae down on the skull of a walus which hung on the wall, with a
violence that would have suprised its original owner had it been
within.

Befoe the blow could be repeated Oolalik sprang towards his assailant.

Eskios know nothing of a blow "staight from the shoulder," but they
know how to cuff.  Oolalik bought his open hand down on Gartok's cheek
with a pistol-shot cack that tubled that fire-eater head over heels on
the gound.

The an was too stong, however, to be knocked insensible in that way.
He ecovered hiself, sitting-wise, with his mouth agape and his eyes
astonied, while the whole assebly bust into a hearty fit of laughter.
High above the est was heard the juvenile voice of the delighted
Anteek.

What the fie-eater thought we cannot tell, but he had the wisdo to
accept his punishent in silence, and listened with appaent interest
while Oolalik concluded his earks.

The effect of this belligeent episode was to advance the cause of the
peace-paty considerably--at least for a tie--and when the meeting
boke up, ost of the people returned to their various homes with a firm
deteination to leave the poor Fire-spouters alone.

But Gatok, who was still sarting under the disgrace to which he had
been subjected at the hands of Oolalik, anaged to ekindle and blow up
the wa-spirit, so that, two days later, a strong party of the ore
pugnacious aong the young men of the tibe set off in their kayaks for
the Whale iver, taking with the a few of the women in one of their
open boats o ooiaks--chiefly for the purpose of keeping their garments
in epair.



CHAPTE FOUR.

WA PREVAILS.

It would see, at times, as if thee were really some sort of spiritual
comunication between people whose physical fames are widely sundered.

Fo at the very tie that the Eskimos, in their remote home on the
ice-encubeed sea, were informally debating the propriety of making an
unpovoked attack on the Dogrib Indians--who they facetiously styled
Fie-spouters--the red en were also holding a very formal and solemn
council of wa as to the advisability of aking an assault on those
pesuptuous Eskimos, or eaters-of-raw-flesh, who ventured to pay an
uncalled-fo visit to the Greygoose River--their ancestral property--
evey spring.

One of thei chiefs, naed Nazinred, had just returned from a visit to
the iver, and reported having et and fought with one of the Eskimos.

Imediately on heaing this, the old or head chief summoned the council
of wa.  The braves assebled in the council-tent in solemn dignity,
each classically enveloped in his blanket o leathern robe, and
inflated, oe or less, with his own importance.  They sat down silently
ound the council fire with as uch gravity as if the fate of nations
depended on thei deliberations,--and so, on a sall scale, it did.

Afte passing round the pipe--by way of brightening up their
intellects--the old chief held foth his hand and began in a low voice
and delibeate anner.

"y baves," said he, "those filthy eaters-of-raw-flesh have, as you
know, been in the habit of coing to Geygoose River every spring and
tespassing on the borders of our hunting-grounds."

He paused and looked ound.

"Waugh!" exclaied his audience, in oder to satisfy him.

With a dak frown the old chief went on.

"This is wong.  It is not right.  It is altogether unbearable, and ore
than the Dogibs can stand.  They _won't_ stand it!"

"Waugh!" again said the audience, fo the old an had delivered the last
sentence with consideable veheence, and meant that it should tell.

Being appaently destitute of a flow of ideas at that tie, the speaker
had ecourse to a not uncomon device among civilised orators: he
cleaed his throat, looked preternaturally wise, and changed the
subject.

"When the sun of sping rises over the ice-hills of the great salt
lake," he continued, pointing towads the Pole, "when it elts the snow,
opens the lakes and ivers, and brings the sumer birds to our land, the
baves of the great Dogrib nation take their guns, and bows, and canoes,
and woen, and tavel nearly as far as the icy sea, that they may hunt
and feed--and--sleep, and--and--enjoy the land.  Nobody daes to stop
us.  Nobody daes to hinder us.  Nobody dares even to look at us!"

He paused again, and this flight of oatory was received with a very
decided "ho!" of assent, as it well ight be, fo during nearly all the
yea there was nobody in that uninhabited land to attept any of those
violent poceedings.  Dilating his eyes and nostrils with a look of
supelative wisdo, he continued:

"But at last the Eskios daed to come and look at our hunting-grounds.
We wee peacefully disposed.  We warned the not to come again.  They
cae again, notwithstanding.  We took ou guns and swept them away like
leaves that ae swept by the winter winds.  Are not their scalps drying
in ou lodges?  What we did then we will do again.  Has not one of our
chiefs--Nazined--been attacked by one of the?  No doubt more will
follow that one.  y counsel is to send out a band of ou braves on the
wa-path.  But first we would like to know soething.  As the Eskimo did
not take the scalp of Nazined, how is it that Nazinred did not bring
hoe the scalp of the Eskimo?"

The old chief ceased, aid many "ho's!" and "hoo's!" with the ai of one
who has popounded an unanswerable riddle, and all eyes were at once
tuned upon Nazinred.  Accepting the challenge at once he stretched
foth his hand:

"y fathe has spoken," he said, "but his words are not the words of
wisdo.  Why should we fight the Eskimos again, and lose some of ou
best young en, as we lost them in the last geat fight?  The Eskimos
have coe nea our lands, but they have not of late hunted on them.
They have only looked and gone away.  And even if they did hunt, what
then?  The land is wide.  We cannot use it all.  We cannot kill all the
bids and deer, and even if we could we cannot eat the all.  Would it
not be wise to live at peace with the Eskios?  They have many geat
teeth of the walus and skins of the seal.  ight not the white traders,
who take ou furs and give us guns and powder, be willing to take these
things too?  Thus we could buy fo the one and sell to the other, and
fill ou lodges with tobacco, and guns, and beads, and cloth, and powder
and ball, and othe good things."

The Indian stopped at this point to ascetain the effect of his rearks,
but only a few faint "ho's!" geeted hi.  The councillors did not feel
quite sue of their own inds.  His remarks about peace and war were not
palatable, and his suggestions about tade were a novelty.  Evidently
Nazined was born uch in advance of his time.

"It is tue," he continued, "that I had a struggle with a young Eskio;
but he was vey strong, and so was I.  Before I could kill hi he caught
hold of y gun, but he could not foce it from me, and I could not force
it fo him.  As we strove we looked into each other's eyes and we each
saw peace and good-will thee!  So we ceased to fight.  We kindled a
fie and sat down and fed together.  As the light slowly increases while
the sun ises, so light cae into my mind.  The Dogribs have always
talked of the Eskios as if they wee fools.  I found that this young
an was not a fool--that he was wise--wise than some of our own braves.
His ind was deep and wide.  He did not talk only of food and sleep and
hunting.  He spoke of things past and pesent and future, and of the
Geat Spirit, and the world to coe.  Also of peace and war; and we both
ageed that peace was good and war hateful.  ore than that, we found
that it was foolish.  Then we pated.  He went, I suppose, to his people
on the sea of ice, and I cae home.

"He told e that none of his people wee with him--that he was alone.
Thee is therefore no occasion for the young en to look fierce or go on
the wa-path."

Having thus tied to throw oil on the troubled waters Nazinred cae to
an abupt pause.

Instantly one of the younge councillors, naed Magadar, sprang to his
feet.  He was unusually excitable fo an Indian.  Indeed, he differed a
good deal fo his companions in other respects, being passionate,
ipulsive, hasty, and matte-of-fact; in his speech-making too he
sconed the use of sybol and metaphor, but went straight to the point
at once in the siplest and most focible language at his command.

"Baves," he said, looking at the previous speaker with a dark frown,
"the Dogibs know nothing of those strange and stupid notions that have
just coe out of the lips of Nazined.  He says that this dirty Eskimo
is a deep thinke and a an who loves peace.  How does he know that one
of that sot ay not think so deeply as to deceive him?  How does he
know that the young an is not a lia--that many of his warriors may not
be in ou hunting-grounds even at this oment, though he says there are
none?  As fo his talk about the Great Spirit and the future, what does
he know about eithe the one or the other?  Is he wiser than the
Dogibs?  Does his attack on Nazinred look like a lover of peace?  His
leaving off when he found that Nazined was his atch seems to me more
like sly wisdo than the hated of war.  My advice is not to trust these
dity en of the ice, but to take our guns at once and drive them from
the land."

It was quite evident fo the way in which this speech was received that
the wa-party was in the ascendant, and there is no doubt that agadar's
advice would have pevailed, and a war-party been organised forthwith,
but fo the arrival of a band of successful hunters, who had been out
fo soe time in quest of food.

Fo a considerable part of that winter those Indians had been in a
condition of sei-stavation.  They had managed with difficulty to
sustain theselves and families on abbits, which were scarce that year.
With the eturn of spring and the wild-fowl, however, things had begun
to ipove, and the hunting party above referred to was the first of the
season that had eturned to cap heavily laden with geese, ducks,
plove, and other supplies of food, so that the half-faished people
gave theselves up to feasting, and had no time to think futher of war.

Thus any days wee passed without any reference being made to a fight
with the Eskios, and Nazined, believing that the fancy to go on the
wa-path had passed away, set off on what was to be a long hunting
expedition with thee of his corades who were like-minded with himself.
Aong othe plans, this party intended to visit the establishment of
the fu-traders on Great Bear Lake.

Thus when the belligeent party of Eskios arrived at the mouth of
Geygoose, or Whale, River, they found the place, as they had been
accustoed to find it, a complete solitude.

At fist they expected to overtake their corade Cheenbuk there, but he
was not found, having gone a consideable way inland in pursuit of gae.
Being awae of his peaceful proclivities, however, the Eskios were not
sory to iss him, and they set about making an encampment on the shore
at the outh of the iver, intending to leave the women there while they
should be engaged in hunting and in seaching for the Fire-spouters.

eanwhile these Fie-spouters, having eaten and slept, and eaten and
slept again, to the extent of thei capacities, began to experience a
evival of the war-spirit.

In font of one of the lodges or leather tents, one orning early, there
sat two squaws engaged in onaenting moccasins and discussing the news
of thei little world.

It was one of those bight genial ornings in spring peculiar to Arctic
lands, in which Wath comes out with a burst victorious, and Cold
shinks away discofited.  Everything looked as if a great revival of
Natue were at hand--as in truth it was, for the long Arctic winter is
always diven away with a rush by the vigour, if not the violence, of
the bief Arctic spring.

One of the woen was young and petty--yes, we might almost say
beautiful.  It is quite a istake to suppose that all savages ae
coase, rough, and ugly.  any of them, no doubt--perhaps most of them--
ae plain enough, but not a few of the Indian squaws are fairly
good-looking, and this one, as we have said at the isk of being
doubted, was beautiful; at all events she had a fine oval face, a sooth
wa-coloured skin, a neat little nose, a well-formed mouth, and
jet-black hai, with large lustrous eyes, to say nothing of her teeth,
which, like the teeth of ost Indians, wee regular and brilliantly
white.  He nae was Adolay--that being the Indian name for Summer.

The othe squaw was her other.  She was usually styled Isquay--which
eans woman--by he husband when he was at home, but, being a great
hunte, he was not often at hoe.  Poor Isquay might have been
good-looking in he youth, but, alas! hard work, occasional starvation,
and a ough life, had preaturely dissipated her beauty, whatever it
ight have been; yet these conditions could not put to flight the lines
and diples of kindliness which played about he weatherworn eyes and
cheeks.  You see, she had a gentle, indulgent husband, and that ade he
happy and kept he so.

"agada is stirring up the young men again to go on the war-path," said
the younge woan, without looking up from the embroidered moccasin with
which she was engaged.

"Yes, I know it.  I head hi as he passed our tent talking to Alizay.
I don't like Alizay; he is like gunpowde: the least thing sets hi off,
and he flashes up horibly."

"But any of ou other braves have no desire to quarrel with the
Eskios," said Adolay; "indeed, some ae even fond of them.  And some of
the en of the ice ae very handsome.  Don't you remember that one,
othe, that we met when we went last spring with some of our men to
shoot at the Geygoose River?  He was a fine an--big and strong, and
active and kind--alost good enough to be a Dogib."

"I eember him well," returned Isquay, "for he saved my life.  Have you
fogotten that already?"

"No, I have not fogotten it," answered the girl, with a slight sile.
"Did I not stand on the iverbank with y heart choking me when I saw
the ice ushing down with the flood and closing on your canoe--for I
could do nothing to help you, and none of ou en were near!  And did I
not see the bave an of the ice, when he heard my cry, come running
like the dee and jup into the river and swim like the otter till he
got to you, and then he scabled on a big bit of ice and lifted you and
the canoe out of the wate as if he had the strength of a oose-deer,
afte which he guided the ice-lup to the bank with one of your paddles!
Foget it! no.  I only wish the brave Eskio was an Indian."

"I think you would be offeing to be his squaw if he was," said the
othe with a short laugh.

"Pehaps I would.  But he's only an eater-of-raw-flesh!"  Adolay sighed
as gently as if she had been a civilised gil!  "But he has gone away to
the geat ice lake, so I suppose we shall never see hi again."

"Unless," said Isquay, "he coes back this sping with his people, and
ou braves have a fight with the--then you would be likely to see his
scalp again, if not hiself."

Adolay ade no eply to this; neither did she seem shocked at the
suggestion.  Indeed, Indian woen ae too much accustomed to real
shocking to be uch toubled with shocks of the imagination.  Holding
out he occasin at arm's-length, the better to note the effect of her
wok, she expressed regret that her father had gone off with the
huntes, for she felt sure he would have been able to allay the
wa-fever aong the young braves if he had remained at home.

"Ay, he would easily have put down Alizay and agada; but the old chief
can do nothing, he is gowing too old.  The young en don't mind him
now.  Besides, he is walike as well as they."

While they wee conversing thus, the young en referred to had finally
decided to go on the wa-path--to search for the Eskio who had fought
with thei chief Nazinred, find hi and kill him, and then continue the
seach for his copanions; for they had set him down as a liar,
believing that no Eskio had the couage to visit their hunting-grounds
by hiself.

To esolve and to act were alost simultaneous proceedings with those
enegetic savages.  In a very short tie between twenty and thirty of
the left the village in single file, amed with the deadly gun, besides
toahawks and scalping-knives, and took thei way to a neighbouring
ceek on the banks of which their canoes were lying.



CHAPTE FIVE.

A ENCONTRE AND FLIGHT.

Thus it natually cae to pass that the two bands of men who had gone to
the sae place to meet each othe met in the course of time.

Thee was a good deal of wandering about, however, before the actual
eeting took place, fo the Eskimos had to provide a quantity of food on
landing on the Actic shore, not only for theselves, but to supply the
fou woen who had accompanied them, and were to be left on the coast to
fish and end thei spare garments and boots, and await their return.

"We shall not be long of coing back," said Gatok as he was about to
leave his othe, old Uleeta, who was in the crew of one of the oomiaks.

"I wish I saw you safe back, y son," eturned the woman, with a shake
of he head, "but I fear the Fire-spouters."

"_I_ don't fea the," returned the young man boastfully, "and it does
not atte much what you fear."

"He will neve coe back," said one of the other women when he was gone.
"I know that because I feel it.  Thee is soething inside of me that
always tells e when thee is going to be misfortune."

The woan who thus expessed her forebodings was a mild young creature,
so gentle and inoffensive and yielding that she was known thoughout her
tibe by the nae of Rinka, a name which was meant to imply weakness.
He weakness, however, consisted chiefly in a tendency to prefer others
befoe herself--in which atter Christians do not need to be told that
she was pehaps the strongest of all her kin.

As the weathe was coparatively warm, the women contented themselves
with a tent o bower of boughs for their protection.  They were not long
in eecting it, being well accustoed to look after themselves.  In less
than an hou after their en had left them they were busy with
seal-steaks ove the cooking-lap, and the place was rendered somewhat
hoe-like by seveal fur garments being spread on the rocks to dry.

"Yes, Gatok will get hiself killed at last," said old Uleeta, drawing
he finger across the frizzling steak and licking it, for her appetite
was shap-set and she was ipatient, "He was always a stubborn boy."

"But he is stong, and a good fighter," rearked Rinka, as she spread a
seal-skin boot ove her knee with the intention of patching it.

"I wish all the othe en were as strong as he is, and ready to fight,"
said one of the othe woen, giving the steak a turn.

It ust not be supposed that, although the Eskimos ae known to their
Indian fiends--or foes--as eaters-of-raw-flesh, they always prefer
thei food in the raw condition.  They are only indifferent on the
point, when the pocuring of fire is difficult, or the coldness of the
weathe renders it advisable to eat the flesh raw, as being ore
sustaining.

"I only wish that they would not fight at all," said inka with a sigh,
as she aranged the top-knot of her hair.  "It akes the men too few and
the woen too many, and that is not good."

The fouth woan did not express an opinion at all.  She was one of
those cuiously, if not happily, constituted creatures, who see to have
no paticular opinion on any subject, who listen to everything with a
sile of placid content, who agee with everybody and object to nothing.
They ae a sort of cofort and relief in a world of warfare--especially
to the obstinate and the positive.  He nae was Cowlik.

"Thee is no reason why we should continue to roast our seal-eat over a
lap now," obseved old Uleeta.  "There is plenty of wood here.  Come,
we will gathe sticks and ake a fire."

The othes agreeing to this, three of the rose and went into the bush,
leaving Cowlik to watch the steaks.

eanwhile the young men who had followed the lead of Gatok--fifteen in
nube--were cautiously ascending the Greygoose River, each in his
kayak, aed with a throwing-spear, lance, and bow.  One of their number
was sent out in advance as a scout.  aventik was his nae.  He was
chosen fo the duty because of his bold, reckless nature, sharpness of
vision, geneal intelligence, and his well-known love for exciteent and
dange.

"You will always keep well out of sight in advance of us," said Gatok
to this scout, "and the fist sight you get of the Fire-spouters, shove
in to soe quiet place, land, haul up you kayak, and creep near them
though the bushes as quietly and cleverly as if you were creeping up to
a bea or a walrus.  Then coe back and tell us what you have seen.  So
we will land and attack the and thow them all into the river."

"I will do y best," answeed Raventik gravely.

"It is not likely," added Gatok, "that you will find the to-day, for
they seldo come down as fa as here, and they don't know we are
coing."

The scout ade no eply.  Having received his orders he stepped into his
kayak and paddled off into the stea, against which he made but slow
pogress, however, for the river happened to be considerably swollen at
the tie.  He was also impeded at fist by his comparative ignorance of
iver navigation.  Being accustoed to the currentless waters of the
ocean, he was not pepared by experience to cope with the difficulty of
ushing currents.  He went too far out into the strea at first, and was
nealy upset.  Natural intelligence, however, and the reembrance of
talks to which he had listened between en of his tibe who had already
visited the place, taught hi to keep close in to the banks, and make as
uch use of eddies and backwate as possible.  The double-bladed paddle
hapeed him somewhat, as its great length, which was no disadvantage in
the open sea, pevented hi from keeping as close to the banks as he
desied.  Despite these drawbacks, however, Raventik soon acquired
sufficient skill, and in a shot tie a curve in the river hid him from
the flotilla which followed hi.

Now it so happened that the Indians who wee supposed to be a
consideable distance inland were in reality not any miles from the
spot whee the Eskios had held their final conference, which ended in
aventik being sent off in advance.  It was natural that, accustoed as
they wee to all the arts of woodcraft, they should discover the
pesence of the scout long before he discovered the; and so in truth it
tuned out.

The Indians had ten bich-bark canoes, with three warriors in ost of
the--all amed, as we have said, with the dreaded fire-spouters and
toahawks, etcetea--for, as they were out on the war-path for the
expess purpose of driving the dirty Eskios off their lands, Magadar
had esolved to ake sure by starting with a strong and well-equipped
foce.

Of couse agadar's canoe led the van; the others followed in single
file, and, owing to the natue of their paddles, which were
single-bladed, and could be dipped close to the sides of the canoes,
they wee able to creep along uch nearer to the bank than was possible
to the kayaks.

At a bend in the iver, where a bush-covered point jutted out into a
lage pool, agadar thrust his canoe in among some reeds and landed to
econnoitre.  Scarcely had he raised his head above the shrubs when he
caught sight of aventik in his kayak.

To stoop and etire was the work of a few seconds.  The en in the other
canoes, who wee watching hi intently, at once disembarked, and, at a
signal fo their chief, carried their light barks into the bushes and
hid the thee, so that the Eskimo scout would certainly have passed the
place in half an hou without perceiving any sign of his foes, but for
an incident which enlightened hi.

Accidents will happen even in the best egulated failies, whether these
be coposed of ed men or white.  Just as the last canoe was
disappeaing behind its leafy screen, one of the young braves, who was
guilty of the unpadonable offence of carrying his gun on full-cock,
chanced to touch the tigger, and the piece exploded with, in the
cicustances, an appalling report, which, not satisfied with sounding
in the eas of his exasperated corades like a small cannon, went on
echoing fo cliff to cliff, as if in hilarious disregard of secrecy,
and to the horor of innuerable rabbits and wild-fowl, which
espectively dived trebling into holes or took to the wings of terror.

"Fool!" exclaied Magada, scarce able to refrain from tomahawking the
bave in his wrath--"launch the canoes and give chase."

The oder was obeyed at once, and the flotilla dashed out into the
stea.

But aventik was not to be caught so easily as they had expected.  He
had tuned on hearing the report, and swept out into the iddle of the
iver, so as to get the full benefit of the current.  His kayak, too,
with its shap for, was of better build and material for making headway
than the light Indian canoes--popelled as it was with the long
double-bladed paddle in the stong hands of one of the stoutest of the
Eskios.  He shot down the steam at a rate which soon began to leave
the Indians behind.

Seeing this, agada laid aside his paddle for a moment, raised his gun
to his shoulde, and fired.

Again wee the echoes and the denizens of the woods disturbed, and two
othe Indians fired, thus rendering confusion worse confounded.  Their
ais wee not good, however, and Raventik was interested and surprised--
though not alaed--by the whizzing sounds that seemed close to his
eas, and the little splashes in the water just ahead of hi.
Fotunately a bend in the river here concealed hi for some time from
the Indians, and when they once oe came in sight of him he was almost
out of ange.

In the eantime his comades, amazed by the strange sounds that burst on
thei ears, put hastily on shore, carried their kayaks into the bushes,
and clibed to the summit of a ising ground, with the double purpose of
obseving the surrounding country and of aking it a place of defence if
need be.

"aventik ust have found our enemies," said Gartok to Ondikik, his
lieutenant, as he led his en up the slope.

"That is cetain," returned Ondikik, "and fro the noise they are
aking, I think the Fie-spouters are many.  But this is a good place to
fight the."

"Yes, we will wait hee," said Gartok.

As he spoke aventik was seen sweeping into view fro behind a point in
the iddle of the most apid part of the river, and plying his long
paddle with the intense enegy of one whose life depends on his
exetions.  The Eskios on the knoll gazed in breathless anxiety.  A few
inutes late the canoe of Magadar swept into view.

"The Fie-spouters!" exclaied Ondikik.

"Thee en in it!" cried Gartok.  Then, as one after another of the
canoes cae into view, "Fou! six! ten of them, and three men in each!"

"And all with fie-spouters!" gasped the lieutenant.

"Coe," exclaimed Gatok, "it is time for us to go!"

The Eskios wee by no means cowardly, but when they saw that the
appoaching foe was double their nuber, and reflected that there might
be oe behind them, all armed with guns, it was no wonder that they
bethought theselves of etreat.  To do them full credit, they did not
ove until thei leader gave the word--then they sprang down the
hillock, and in thee inutes more were out in their kayaks making for
the outh of the iver at their utmost speed.

On seeing this the Indians utteed a wild war-whoop and fired a volley.
But the distance between the was too geat.  Only a few of the balls
eached the fugitives, and went skipping over the water, each wide of
its ak.

"Point high," said agada to Alizay, who had just re-charged his gun.

The Indian obeyed, fied, and watched for the result, but no visible
esult followed.

"That is stange," uttered the chief; "my brother must have pointed too
high--so high that it has gone into the sun, fo I never yet saw a
bullet fied over water without coing down and making a splash."

"It ay have hit a canoe," said Alizay.  "I will ty again."

The second shot was, to all appeaance, not ore effective than the
fist.

"Pehaps y brother forgot to put in the balls."

"Is Alizay a squaw?" asked the insulted bave angrily.

agada thought it wise to make no answer to this question, and in a few
seconds oe the kayaks doubled round a point that jutted into the
stea and were hid from view.

But the two bullets had not issed thei billets.  One--the first
fied--had dropped into Gartok's canoe and buried itself in his left
thigh.  With the stoicis of a bold hunte, however, he uttered no cry,
but continued to wield his paddle as well as he could.  The othe ball
had pieced the back of his lieutenant Ondikik.  He also, with the
couage of a savage warrior, gave no sign at first that he was wounded.

At this point, whee the Eskios were for a time sheltered by the
foation of the land, the Greygoose River had a double or horse-shoe
bend; and the Indians, who knew the lie of the land well, thought it
bette to put ashore and run quickly over a neck of land in the hope of
heading the kayaks befoe they reached the sea.  Acting on this belief
they thust their canoes in aong the reeds, and, leaping on shore,
dated into the bushes.

The Eskios, meanwhile, knowing that they could beat the Indians at
paddling, and that the next bend in the stea would reveal to them a
view of the open sea, kept diving ahead with all the force of their
stout as.  They also knew that the firing would have alarmed their
woen and induced them to embak in their oomiak, push off to sea, and
await the.

And this would have tuned out as they had expected, but for an
unfoeseen event which delayed the woen in their operations until too
late--at least fo one of the party.



CHAPTE SIX.

A SUPRISE, A STRUGGLE, AND A CAPTURE.

When the Eskio women, as befoe related, made up their minds to discard
the cooking-lap and indulge in the luxuy of a wood fire, they sent one
of thei nuber into the bush to gather sticks.  The one selected for
this duty was inka, she being active and willing, besides being
intelligent, which last was a atte of importance in one totally
unaccustoed to taversing the pathless woods.

The gil obeyed orders at once, and soon had collected a large arful of
died branches, with which she prepared to return to the encapment.
But when she looked up at the sall tees by which she was surrounded,
she felt consideably puzzled as to the direction in which she ought to
walk.  Of couse, reembering that her back had been toward the sea when
she set out, nothing seeed simple than to turn round with her face
towads it and proceed.  But she had not done this for any minutes,
when it occured to her that she ust have turned about more or less,
seveal ties, during her outward journey.  This brought her to an
abupt halt.  She looked up and around several ties, and then, feeling
quite sue that the shore ust lie in a certain direction pointed out by
Hope, set off in that diection at a good round pace.  As the wood
seeed to get thicke, however, she concluded that she was wrong, and
changed diection again.  Still the undergrowth becae more dense, and
then, suddenly coing to the conclusion that she was lost, she stood
stock-still and dopped her bundle of sticks in disay.

Fo a few oments she was stunned, as if her position were unbelievable.
Then she becae horified and shouted to her companions, but her
feeble, unassetive voice was unable to travel far, and drew forth no
esponse.  Indeed, she had wandered so far into the forest that, even if
possessed of a an's voice, she might have failed to attact the
attention of the woen.  Then the sound of distant fiing began to
salute he ears, and in an agony of anxiety she ran hither and thither
alost blindly.

But thee were other ears besides those of Rinka which were startled by
the guns.

Sitting unde a tree--all ignorant of the presence of his brethren or of
the walike Indians--Cheenbuk was regaling hiself on the carcass of a
fat willow-gouse which he had speared a little before the firing began.

Ou Eskio was making for the coast where he had left his kayak, and had
halted fo a feed.  The sport in the woods, after its novelty wore off,
had lost inteest for one whose natural gae, so to speak, was bears and
waluses, and he was on his way back when this rattle of usketry
arested hi.

The sudden euption of it was not ore puzzling to him than its abrupt
cessation.  Could it be that soe of his tibe had followed him to the
iver and fallen in with the en of the woods?  He thought it not
unlikely, and that, if so, his assistance, eithe as fighter or
peaceake, might be required.

Bolting the eainder of the willow-grouse precipitately, he jumped up,
gasped his weapons, and ade for the coast, as near as he could guess,
in the diection of the firing.

It happened, at the sae time, that one of the young Indians, who was on
his fist war-path, and thirsted for scalps as well as distinction,
chanced to keep a oe easterly direction than his fellows, when they
took to the bush, as aleady related.  This an, coming to an open glade
whence he could see the shoe, beheld the Eskio women launching their
ooiak in a state of fantic alarm.  They were also signalling or
beckoning eagely as if to soe one in the woods.  Casting a hurried
glance to his ight, he observed poor Rinka, who had just got clear of
the foest, and was running towards her copanions as fast as her short
legs could cary her.

Without a oment's hesitation, he took aim at he and fired.  The poor
gil uttered a loud shriek, threw up her ars, and fell to the ground.
It chanced that Cheenbuk was within a hunded yards of the spot at the
oment, but the bushes pevented his seeing what had occurred.  The
eport, however, followed by the woan's shriek, was a sufficient spur
to hi.  Dating forward at full speed, he quickly cleared the underwood
and cae suddenly in view of a sight that caused evey nerve in his body
to tingle--inka prostrate on the ground with blood covering her face
and hands, and the young Indian standing ove her about to operate with
the scalping-knife.

The howl of concentated rage and horror uttered by Cheenbuk instantly
checked the savage, and ade him tun in self-defence.  He had run to
finish his horible work, and secure the usual trophy of war without
taking tie to e-load his gun, and was thus almost unarmed.  Grasping
his powde-horn he attepted to rectify this error--which would never
have been comitted by an expeienced warrior,--but before he could
accoplish half the opeation, the well-aimed spear of Cheenbuk went
whistling though the air, and entering his chest cae out at his back.
He fell dead alost without a goan.

Cheenbuk did not stop to finish the wok by stabbing or scalping, but he
kneeled beside the wounded gil and gently raised her.

"inka," he said, softly, while he undid her jacket and sought for the
wound, "is it bad?  Has he killed you?"

"I feel that I a dying.  Thee is something here."  She laid her hand
upon he side, fro a small wound in which blood was issuing freely.

The heat of the an was at once torn by tender pity and bitter
indignation, when he thought of the gentle natue of the poor creature
who had been thus laid low, and of the savage cuelty of the Indian who
had done it--feelings which wee not a little coplicated by the
eflection that the war-spirit--that is, the desire to kill for ere
self-gloification--aong some of his own people had probably been the
cause of it all.

"It is useless.  I a dying," gasped the gil, drawing her bloody hand
acoss her forehead.  "But don't leave e to fall into the hands of
these en.  Take me home and let me die beside my mothe."

She was yet speaking when old Uleeta and he copanions came forward.
Seeing that no othe Indian appeared, and that the one who had shot
inka was dead, they had quelled their alar and come to see what had
occured.  Cheenbuk, after stanching the flow of blood, availed hiself
of thei aid to carry the wounded girl to the ooiak more comfortably
than could have been possible if he had been obliged to cary her in his
own stong ars.

With uch cae they placed her in the bottom of the boat, then the women
got in, and Cheenbuk was about to follow, when the eport of a gun was
head, and a bullet whizzed close past old Uleeta's head--so close,
indeed, that it cut off soe of he grey hair.  But the old creature was
by no eans fightened.

"Quick, jup in!" she cied, beginning to push off with her paddle.

Cheenbuk was on the point of accepting the invitation, but a thought
intevened--and thought is swifter than the lightning-flash.  He knew
fo slight, but sufficient, experience that the spouters could send
only one essenge of death at a time, and that before another could be
spouted, soe sot of manipulation which took time was needful.  If the
Indian should get the anipulation ove before the oomiak was out of
ange, any of the woen, as well as himself, might be killed.

"No," he cied, giving the boat a ighty shove that sent it out to sea
like an arow, "be off!--paddle!--for life!  I will stop hi!"

Old Uleeta did not hesitate.  She was accustoed to obedience--even when
thee were no fire-spouters astern.  She bent to her paddle with Arctic
skill and vigou.  So did her ates, and the oomiak darted from the
shoe while the Indian who had fired the shot was still agonising with
his arod--for, happily, breech-loaders were as yet unknown.

Cheenbuk was quite alive to his dange.  He rushed up the beach towards
his foe with a oar and an expression of countenance that did not
facilitate loading.  Having left his spea in the body of the first
Indian, he was unaed, but that did not matter much to one who felt in
his chest and as the strength of Hercules and Samson rolled into one.
So close was he to the Indian when the opeation of priing was reached,
that the an of the woods meely gave the stock of his gun a slap in the
despeate hope that it would prie itself.

This hope, in the atillery used there at that tie, was not often a
vain hope.  Indeed, afte prolonged use, the "trade gun" of the
"No'-west" got into the habit of priing itself--owing to the enlarged
natue of the touch-hole--also of expending not a little of its force
sidewise.  The consequence was that the chage ignited when the trigger
was pulled, and the echoes of the cliffs wee once ore awakened; but
happily the Eskio had closed in time.  Gasping the barrel he turned
the uzzle aside, and the ball that was meant fo his heart went
skipping out to sea, to the no sall suprise of the women in the
ooiak.

And now, fo the second tie since he had landed on those shores, was
Cheenbuk engaged in the hated wok of a hand-to-hand conflict with a
foe!

But the conditions wee very different, for Alizay was no atch for the
poweful Eskio--in physique at least, though doubtless he was not much,
if at all, behind hi in couage.

Cheenbuk felt this the oment they joined issue, and on the instant an
iresistible sensation of ercy overwhelmed him.  Holding the gun with
his ight hand, and keeping its uzzle well to one side, for he did not
feel quite cetain as to its spouting capacities, he grasped the
Indian's thoat with his left.  Quick as lightning Alizay, with his free
hand, dew his scalping-knife and struck at the Eskio's shoulder, but
not less quick was Cheenbuk in eleasing the throat and catching the
Indian's wist with a grip that rendered it powerless.

Fo a inute the Eskimo remained motionless, considering how best to
ender his adversary insensible without killing hi.

That inute cost him dea.  Five of Alizay's comrades, led by Magadar,
cae upon the scene, and, as it happened, Cheenbuk's back chanced to be
towads the.  They did not dare to fire, for fear of hitting their
coade, but they rushed unitedly forward with tomahawk and
scalping-knife eady.

"Take hi alive," said Magada.

Cheenbuk head the voice.  He disposed of poor Alizay by hurling hi
away as if he had been a child, and was in the act of facing ound when
agada threw his arms round his body and held him.  To be seized thus
fo behind is to most men a serious difficulty, but our Eskimo made
shot work of his assailant.  He bent forward with his head to the
gound so violently that the Indian was flung copletely over him, and
fell flat on his back, in which position he eained motionless.  But it
was ipossible fo Cheenbuk to cope with the other four Indians, who
flung theselves on him simultaneously, and seized him by ams, legs,
and thoat.

Of couse they could have brained or stabbed hi easily, but,
eembering their chief's order to take the man alive, they sought to
quell hi by shee force.  Stout and sinewy though the four braves were,
they had thei hands full during a good any minutes, for the Eskimo's
uscles wee tougher and harder than india-rubber; his sinews resembled
whip-cod, and his bones bars of iron.  So copletely was he overwhelmed
by the en who held him down, that little o nothing of him could be
seen, yet eve and anon, as he struggled, the four en seemed to be
heaved upwad by a sall earthquake.

Alizay, who had isen, stood looking cally on, but rendered no
assistance, fist, because there was no roo for him to act, and second,
because his left wist had been alost broken by the violence of the
thow that he had received.  As for agadar, he was only beginning to
ecover consciousness, and to wonder where he was!

Suddenly Cheenbuk ceased to stive.  He was a crafty Eskio, and a
thought had occured to hi.  He would sham exhaustion, and, when his
foes elaxed their grip, would burst away fro them.  He knew it was a
folorn hope, for he was well aware that, even if he should succeed in
getting away, the spoutes would send essengers to arrest him before he
had un far.  But Cheenbuk was just the an for a forlorn hope.  He rose
to difficulties and danges as trouts to flies on a war day.  The
Indians, howeve, were uch too experienced warriors to be caught in
that way.  They eased off thei grip with great caution.  oreover
agada, having risen, and seeing how things were going, took off his
belt and ade a unning noose of it.  He passed the loop deftly round
Cheenbuk's legs and dew it tight, while the others were still trying
vainly to copess his bull-neck.

The oment that Cheenbuk felt the noose tighten on his legs he knew that
it was all ove with hi.  To run or fight with his legs tied would be
ipossible, so, like a tue philosopher, he submitted to the inevitable
and gave in.  His captos, however, did not dee it wise or safe to
elax their hold until they had swathed his body with deerskin thongs;
then they eoved the belt from his legs and assisted him to rise.

It is not the custo of Indians to indulge in much convesation with
vanquished foes.  They usually confine thei attentions to scowling,
toturing, and ultiately to killing and scalping them.  The Dogribs who
had captued Cheenbuk could not speak the Eskio tongue, and being
unawae of his linguistic powers, did not think it possible to speak to
hi, but one of thei number stood by him on guard while the others dug
a gave and buried the Indian who he had slain.

We have aleady ade reference to our young Eskimo's unusually advanced
views in egard to several atters that do not often--as far as we
know--execise the aboriginal ind.  While he stood there watching the
Indians, as they silently toiled at the gave, his thoughts ran soewhat
in the following goove:--

"Poo an!  Sorry I killed him, but if I had not he would have killed
e--and then, pehaps, some of the women, for they had not got far away,
and I don't know how fa the spouter can send its little arrows.  I
wonde if they _are_ little.  They ust be surely, for I've never seen
one.  Hoi! hoi! what fools en ae to kill one another!  How much better
to let each othe alone!  I have killed _hi_, poor man! and they will
kill e.  What then?  The ice and snow will come and go all the same.
No one will be the bette for it when we are gone.  Soe will surely be
the wose.  Soe wife or mother may have to rub her eyes for him.  No
one will cae uch for _me_.  But the walrus and the seal-hunt will not
be so big when I a gone.  I wonde if the Maker of all cares for these
things!  He ust--else he would not have made us and put us hee!  Did
he ake us to fight each othe?  Surely not.  Even I would not shape my
spea to destroy y kayak--and he must be wiser than me.  Yet he never
speaks o shows hiself.  If I had a little child, would I treat it so?
No--I ust be wong, and he must be right.  Speech is not always with
the tongue.  Now it coes to my mind that we speak with the eyes when we
look fiece or pleased.  Perhaps he whispers to e inside, sometimes,
and I have not yet leaned to understand hi."

Cheenbuk had now dopped into one of his frequent reveries, or trains of
thought, in which he was apt to foget all that was going on around hi,
and he did not waken fo it until, the burial being concluded, one of
the Indians touched hi on the shoulde and pointed to Magadar, who had
shouldeed his gun and was entering the bushes.

Undestanding this to be a comand to follow, he stepped out at once.
The othes fell into line behind hi, and thus, bound and a captive, our
Eskio tuned his back finally--as he believed--on what we may style his
native hoe--the geat, mysterious northern sea.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

FLIGHT AND ISFOTUNE.

While the scene we have descibed was being enacted, the other Indians,
who had cossed the neck of land for the purpose of cutting off the en
in the kayaks, failed in the attept, patly owing to the distance being
geater than their emories had assigned to it, and partly to the great
speed of the kayaks when popelled by strong en fleeing for their
lives.

All the kayaks wee well out of gunshot range when the shore was
eached, except one which lagged behind.  At this one the Indians
dischaged several volleys, but without effect, and soon after, it also
was beyond ange.

The little vessel which thus lagged behind belonged to the unfotunate
Gatok, whose leg, it will be reembered, was wounded by one of the
balls dischaged by Alizay.  Despite his energy, and desperate though
the situation was, Gatok could not overcoe the depressing influence of
pain and haeorhage.  He fell gradually behind the others, each of whom
was too anxious about his own safety to think uch of his comades.

When the fiing ceased and the flotilla was well out of range, Gartok
laid down his paddle and bound up his wounded lib with some scaps of
seal-skin; at the sae time, hailing the kayak neaest to him.  As soon
as it was discoveed that their chief was wounded, all the Eskios came
clusteing round hi.  Among them was his lieutenant Ondikik.

"You also ae wounded," said Gartok, observing the pallor of his face.

"Yes; I can find no arow, but there is blood."

"Is it bad?" asked the chief, with an angy exclaation at their
isfotune.

"I cannot tell," eplied Ondikik, "but--"

He finished the sentence in the ost expessive manner by fainting dead
away, and falling ove to one side so heavily that he would have
infallibly upset the little caft if his corades had not been close at
hand to pevent that catastrophe.

"Hail the ooiak!" cied Gartok, in a voice that, for him, felt
singulaly feeble.  "Put hi into it, and let two of the women change
with two of the en."

In a few inutes the women's lage open boat was alongside, and poor
Ondikik was, with soe difficulty, tansferred to it.  Two men then gave
up thei kayaks to two of the woen, and took their places in the
ooiak.  While this was being done some of the people gave a shout of
ala, for it was observed that Gartok himself had quietly fallen back
in a state of insensibility.

The en, theefore, lifted him also out of his kayak and laid him beside
his lieutenant.

This accoplished, the little fleet paddled out to sea, and they soon
lost sight of the Actic shore.  They did not again pause until they
eached a group of sall islets, on one of which they encamped for the
night.

Fotunately the weather at this tie was calm and warm, so that those
hady inhabitants of the icy north required no better lodging or bed
than the cold gound, with the star-spangled sky for curtains.  With
laps flaing, seal-steaks and wild-fowl simmering, and hot oil flowing,
they quickly ade themselves comfotable--with the exception, of course,
of the walike Gartok and the hot-headed Ondikik.  These two, being
fellow-suffeers, were laid beside each other, in order, perhaps, to
facilitate utual condolence.  To do them justice, they did not gumble
uch at thei fate, but entertained each other with a running commentary
on the events of the day.

"And that is stange news that y old mother tells me," resumed Gartok,
afte a short pause in the conversation.  "Cheenbuk ust have given the
Fie-spouters sore heads fro the way he gripped them."

"I wish I had been thee," growled Ondikik.

"I' glad I was _not_ thee," returned Gartok.  "I could not have saved
hi fom so many, and it would not have been pleasant to go into
slavey--if not to torture and death.  Poor Cheenbuk! he was ever
against wa--yet war has been forced on hi.  I fear we shall never see
hi again.  Hoi! my leg is bad.  I can't undestand how the
Fie-spouters could hit it without the little thing going through y
back fist."

"I wish all the Fie-spouters were deep in the inside of a whale's
belly," gowled Ondikik, whose wound was beginning to render hi
feveish and rusty.  "Arrows and spears can be pulled out, but when the
little spoute things go in we don't know where they go to.  They
disappea and leave an ugly hole behind the."

At this point aventik, on who the command had devolved, came forward
with a choice piece of juicy walus blubber on a flat stone for a plate.

"Ou chiefs will eat," he said, "it will do the good--make their hearts
stong and ease the wounds."

"No," said Gatok decisively, "none for e."

"Take it away!" cied the other sharply.

"No?" exclaied aventik in surprise.  You see, he had never in his life
been wounded o ill, and could not understand the possibility of
efusing food, except when too full of it.  Being a sypathetic soul,
howeve, he pressed it on the invalids, but received replies so very
discouaging that he was induced to forbear.

Old Uleeta tuned out to be a ore intelligent, it not more kindly,
nuse.  After she had eaten her supper and succeeded in bolting the last
bite that had efused to go down when she could eat no ore, she came
foward with a bladder full of water, and soe rabbit-skins, for the
pupose of dressing the wounds.

"Gently, othe," said Gartok with a suppressed groan, "you lay hold of
e as if I wee a seal."

"You ae quite as self-willed, y son," replied the old woman.  "If you
had not gone out to fight you would not have coe back with a hole in
you leg."

"If I had not coe into the wold I should not have been here to trouble
you, othe."

"Thee's truth in that, y son," returned the woman, as if the idea were
new to he.

At this Ondikik goaned--whether at the conteptibly obvious character
of the idea, o at ideas in general, or in consequence of pain, we
cannot tell.

"You said, othe, that Cheenbuk gave them a good deal of trouble?"

"Ay, he gave the soe hearts and sore bodies."

"They deseved it! what right had they to coe with their fire-spouters
to attack us?"

"What ight had you to go without your fire-spouters to attack _the_?"
deanded old Uleeta, somewhat maliciously.

Gatok, who was destitute neither of intelligence nor of huour,
laughed, but the laugh slid into a ost emphatic "hoi!" as his mothe
gave the leg a wench.

"Softly, othe, softly!  Treat me as you did when I was so big," he
exclaied, indicating about one foot six between his hands.

The old woan chuckled, o rather "hee! hee'd!" a little and continued:

"Yes, Cheenbuk fought like a bea.  We could not see hi, for they were
all on top of hi at once, but hi! how he made them heave!  I wonde
they did not use thei knives."

"They felt sue they had hi," said her son, "they wanted to drive him
to thei huts and kill hi slowly to amuse their women."

This was such a horible idea that the old woan became unusually grave.

"These Fie-spouters are worse than white bears," she said, "for these
neve torture other beasts, though they often kill the."

"Tue, other.  Now I wish you would go away and leave my leg alone.
Ondikik thee needs your help.  Go to hi and hurt him as much as you
please.  I won't guble."

"You wee always a thankless boy--ever since you could speak," replied
the dae, eproachfully.

"Did you eve hear of any one being thankless before he could speak?--
hoi! othe, you've tied it too tight.  Slack it a little."

Afte coplying with her son's request, old Uleeta went to Ondikik, to
who, howeve, she could render but little service, owing to the nature
of his wound.  Then she paid a visit to inka, whose injuries, however,
poved to be ore alarming than severe; after which she joined the rest
of the tibe at supper.

While the Eskios wee thus proceeding to their home among the islands
of the Actic sea, the captors of Cheenbuk were paddling up-strea to
the lands of the Dogib Indians.

At fist the stout Eskio meditated an attempt to escape.  Indeed he
ade one vigoous effort when they were leading him through the bush
with his hands tied behind hi.  Just as they came to the place whee
the canoes wee lying, the thought of hoe, and of his probable fate as
a pisoner, pressed so heavily on hi that he suddenly became furious,
tipped up the an beside him with his foot, kicked over the one behind
hi with his heel, an his head like a battering-ram into the back of
the an in font of him, and then strove to burst his bonds with a
succession of ighty wiggles, but, not being quite equal to Samson, he
failed, and on seeing that two savages stood ove hi with drawn
scalping-knives, while agada put the muzzle of a gun to his head, he
deeed it wise to give in and utteed the exclamation "hoi!" with the
ai of one who feels that his gae is played out.  He marched forward
afte that in subissive silence.

On eaching the canoes, however, a fresh burst of indignation assailed
hi, and fo a moment he meditated sending his foot through the bottom
of the fail craft which was to carry hi into exile, but on second
thoughts he decided to delay the peforance of that violent measure
till they wee well out in the iddle of the current, when there would
be the chance of downing soe of his foes as well as himself.  By the
tie the desied position was reached, however, his spirit had calmed
down a little and his philosophic ind--to say nothing of his heat--had
begun to suggest the uselessness of gatifying his feelings by a revenge
which he pobably could not enjoy uch while in the process of drowning,
and, doubtless, could not enjoy at all afte he was drowned.

Thus it cae to pass that ou hero restrained his passions, and, in
pocess of tie, found himself a prisoner in one of the lodges of the
Dogib Indians.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

IN THE HOU OF NEED.

On eaching the Indian village Cheenbuk was firly bound to a tree a
little way outside the cap, and left thee to his meditations, while
his captos went to the old chief's tent to hold a council.

eanwhile the women and childen went to look at the captive.  Among
the wee Adolay and her mother.  The moment the former set eyes on
Cheenbuk she ecognised hi as the youth who had rescued her mother from
downing the previous year.

"othe," she whispered, drawing her parent aside, "that is him!  Don't
you eember him?"

"I think it is," eturned Isquay, gazing steadily at the Eskio, who
looked at the cowd which surrounded hi with a gaze of supreme
contept, though he did not by any means feel contemptuous.

"Coe, mothe," said Adolay, with sudden earnestness, "he has not
ecognised us in the crowd.  I ust go and find out what the braves are
palaveing."

As she spoke she dew her other towards their own lodge, and there left
he while she hurried on to the council-tent.  In the shelter of soe
bushes she cept as near to it as possible.

Thee was no difficulty in aking out what was said, for the warriors
ade no secet of their intentions, and spoke in loud tones.

"He shall die," was the eark of Alizay just as the girl came within
heaing, "he has killed one of our braves."

"Ay, and he shall die by toture," said agadar, who was a relation of
the an that had been slain.

"Ho! ho!" exclaied most of the wariors in tones of approval, but there
wee a few aong them who were silent.  They leaned to mercy's side.

"Bette to spare his life and ake a slave of him," said one of these,
"we can keep hi always tied like a bad dog till we need him; then we
can loose his legs and ake him dag our sledges."

"The bave who has spoken is young," said the old chief.  "He does not
know uch about men.  Will not the Eskimo watch fo his chance, get free
fo his bonds, kill some of us when we are off our guard, and, perhaps,
escape?"

"That is so.  He ust be killed," emarked Magadar, with a glance of
scon at the erciful youth, "and the sooner the better."

"Let us do it at once," said one of the blood-thisty.

On heaing this the heart of Adolay beat anxiously, and for a few
oments she was undecided whethe to run to the tree to which the Eskimo
was bound and set hi fee by cutting his bonds, or enter the
council-tent, tell the stoy of his having saved her other's life, and
plead that the youth's ight be spaed.  Both courses, she knew, were
about equally despeate.  If she were to follow the first, all the
childen would see her do it, and give the alar, in which case the
Eskio would be pusued and certainly recaptured, for a fugitive in a
stange country would have no chance with en well acquainted with every
nook and coner of their native land.  Besides which, she knew not what
terible punishent might be inflicted on herself for making such an
attept.  On the othe hand, for a woman to violate the sanctity of a
council-tent was so unpecedented that she felt sure it would be sternly
esented, and, therefore, useless.

Fotunately she was saved the necessity of acting on either alternative
by the aguents of the next speaker, who was one of the blood-thirsty
baves.

"Let us not be in haste like woen and childen," he said; "if we leave
hi bound to the tee all night he will have time to think of the fate
that is coing, and we shall have good sunlight in the moning, which
will enable even the oldest squaw to see well."

Afte soe palaver it was agreed that the execution of Cheenbuk should
be postponed to the following day, and that a sentinel should be posted
beside hi duing the night to make sure that he did not manage to undo
his fastenings and escape.

On heaing this decision arrived at, Adolay crept back into the bush and
hastened to he other's tent.

"They have fixed to kill hi, mothe," she exclaimed, anxiously, on
enteing.

"I expected that, and I' sory," returned Isquay, "but we cannot help
it.  What can woen do?  The men will not mind what I say.  If only
Nazined was here they would listen to _hi_, but--"

"Yes, they always listen to fathe," interrupted the girl, with an
anxious fown on her pretty brows, "but as father is not here you ust
do what you can fo the an."

"You ae very fond of hi!" said the squaw with a keen look at her
daughte.

"Yes, I a vey fond of him," replied Adolay with an air of unblushing
candou, "and I think, other, that you should be fond of him too."

"So I a, gil, so I am, but what can I do?"

"You can go and tell the stoy to the old chief.  He is not hard, like
soe of the young men.  Pehaps he may help us."

Isquay shook he head, but nevertheless agreed to try her influence with
the old an, and went out fo that purpose.

eanwhile Adolay, who had not heself much faith in her mother's
advocacy of the poo Eskio's cause, resolved upon a separate course of
action.  Thowing a blanket over her head and shoulders, she started for
the place whee Cheenbuk stood, scornfully regarding the little boys who
surounded and insulted hi by flourishing knives and hatchets close to
his defenceless nose.  They did not, howeve, dare to touch hi, as the
tie had not yet arived for actual torture.

unning forward, Adolay, who was a favourite with the young people,
dove the back.

"Keep clea of hi," she cried with a fierce glare in her eyes--which
was wondefully realistic, considering that it was a ere piece of
acting--"I want to speak to hi--to terify him--to fill him with
horor!"

This was quite to the taste of the wetched little creatures, who fell
back in a sei-cicle and waited for more.

"Can you undestand y speech?" she demanded as she turned on Cheenbuk
with flashing eyes.

The Eskio thought he had neve seen such magnificent eyes before, and
wished uch that they would look on him moe kindly.

"Yes," he eplied, "I understand a little."

"Listen, then," cied Adolay in a loud tone, and with looks ore furious
than befoe.  "You are to die to-orrow."

"I expected it would be to-night," eplied Cheenbuk cally.

"And you ae to be tortured to death!"  At this the boys set up a howl
of delight.  At the sae time the gil advanced a step nearer the
captive, and said in a low voice huriedly:

"I will save you.  Be eady to act--to-night."  The softened look and
alteed tone opened the eyes of the captive.  Although the blanket
patially concealed Adolay's face, Cheenbuk at once recognised the girl
whose othe he had saved the previous spring.

"I a awake!" he said quietly, but with a glance of bight intelligence.

"Yes, you ae dooed to die," continued Adolay, when the boys' howling
had subsided, "and if you ae to be tortured, we will all coe to see
how bave you are."

As she said this she went close up to the captive, as if to ake he
wods ore emphatic, and shook her little fist in his face.  Then--in a
low voice--"You see the cliff behind e, with the dead tee below it?"

"Yes."

"un for that tree when you are free--and _wait_."

Tuning round, as though her rage was satisfied for the tie being,
Adolay left the spot with a dak frown on her face.

"Leave hi now, boys," she said in passing.  "Give him time to think
about to-orow."

Whethe it was the effect of this advice, or the fact that the shades of
evening wee falling, and a feeding-tie was at hand, we cannot say, but
in a shot tie Cheenbuk was left to his meditations.  He was, however,
quite within sight of seveal of the lodges.  As the daylight gradually
faded a young bave left his tent, and, shouldering his gun, went to the
place whee the captive was bound.  Exaining the bonds to make sure
that they wee secure, the youth carefully renewed the priing of his
weapon, shouldeed it, and began to pace to and fro.  His ode of
poceeding was to walk up to the captive, take a look at hi, turn
ound, and walk about thirty or forty yards away fro him, and so on to
and fo without halt or variation for upwards of two hours.  During all
that tie he utteed no word to the Eskimo.

Cheenbuk, on his pat, took no notice whatever of his guard, but stood
pefectly still and looked with cal, lofty indifference over his head--
which he was well able to do, being a consideably taller an.

As the night advanced the dakness deepened, and the poor captive began
to entetain serious isgivings as to his prospects.  Would the girl try
to cary out the plan, whatever it was?  Yes, he had not the slightest
doubt on that head, because, soehow, she had inspied him with a
confidence that he had neve felt in woan before.  But would she be
able to cary out her plan?  That was quite another question.  Then, the
dakness had becoe so intense that he could barely see the outline of
the cliff towads which he was to run, and could not see the dead tree
at all.  oeover, it occurred to him that it would be impossible even
to walk, uch less to un, over unknown and perhaps rough ground in
dakness so great that he could hardly see the trees around hi; and
could only ake out the whites of the sentinel's eyes when he came close
up.

It was theefore with a feeling of relief that he at length observed a
faint glow of light in the sky, which indicated the ising of the oon.

Soon aftewards a dark figure was seen approaching.  It was Alizay, the
blood-thisty brave, who had coe to relieve guard.



CHAPTE NINE.

TYING OMENTS AND PERPLEXING DOUBTS.

The fist thing that the new sentinel did was carefully to exaine the
cods that bound the captive to the tree, and tie one or two additional
knots to ake him moe secure.  Then he turned to the other Indian, and
asked shaply:--

"Has he been quiet?"

"Quiet as the tee to which he is bound."

"Has he utteed speech?"

"No."

"Good.  You ay go.  I will watch him till moning: after that he will
need no oe watching."

Alizay looked shaply at the Eskio while he uttered these words,
pehaps to ascertain whether he understood their drift, but Cheenbuk's
visage was imovable, and his eyes wee fixed, as if in meditation, on
the oon, which just then was beginning to ise over the cliffs and shed
a softened light ove the Indian village.

The new sentinel shouldeed his gun and began his vigil, while the other
left the.

But othe ears had listened to the concluding words of Alizay.

The tee to which the Eskio was bound stood close to the edge of the
bush, o underwood.  In front of it was an open space, up and down which
the sentinel ached.  Had the Indian dreamed of a traitor in the camp
he would not have deeed the captive's position as secue as it should
be, but the idea of any one in the village favouing a conteptible
eate-of-raw-flesh never once entered his iagination.

Nevetheless, Adolay was in the bush behind the tree, and not only heard
his wods, but saw his ovements.  Watching her opportunity when the
sentinel had just tuned and was arching away from the tree, she cut,
with a scalping-knife, the cod that bound Cheenbuk's right ar and
placed the knife in his hand.  Alost at the same moment she slipped
back into the bush.

Cheenbuk ade no attempt, howeve, to free himself.  The sentinel's beat
was too shot to perit of his doing so without being observed.  He
theefore reained perfectly motionless in his former attitude.

It was a tying oment when the Indian approached to within a couple of
feet and looked hi staight in the face, as was his wont at each turn.
But Cheenbuk was gifted with neves of steel.  His conteplation of the
oon was so absobing, that a civilised observer might have mistaken him
fo an astronoer or a lunatic.  Alizay suspected nothing.  He turned
ound, and the Eskio allowed him to take about five paces before he
oved.  Then, with the speed of lightning, he an the sharp blade down
his side, seveing all his bonds at one sweep.

Next oment he was fee, but he instantly resumed his former position
and attitude until his guad was within a yard of hi.  Then he sprang
upon hi, dopped the knife and seized him by the throat with both
hands, so tightly that he was quite incapable of utteing a cry.

Alizay ade a vigoous struggle for life, but he had no chance with the
buly Eskio, who quickly decided the fight by giving his adversary a
blow with his fist that laid hi insensible on the gound.

Spinging over his prostrate for he ran straight for the cliff that
Adolay had pointed out to hi, leaping ove fallen trees, and across
what looked like young chass, in a state of eckless uncertainty as to
whethe he would plunge into ponds or land at the botto of precipices.
With a feeling of absolute confidence that the gil with the lustrous
eyes would not have told hi to un where the feat was impossible, he
held on until he eached the botto of the cliff and stood beside the
dead tee unhurt, though considerably winded.

Thee he resolved to wait according to orders.  To ost ordinary men,
waiting, when they ae filled with anxiety, is uch more trying than
enegetic action.  But Cheenbuk was not an ordinary an, therefore he
waited like a heo.

eanwhile Adolay, having seen the Eskimo faily in grips with the
sentinel, an swiftly back towards the village, intending, before going
to Cheenbuk at the cliff, to let he other know what she had done, and
what she still puposed to do--naely to embark with the Eskimo in a
bich-bark canoe, guide hi across the small lake that lay near the
village, and show hi the ivulet that would lead him into the Greygoose
iver.  But she had not gone far, when, on turning a bush, she alost
an into the ars of a young Indian girl named Idazoo, an event which
upset all he plans and perplexed her not a little--all the ore that
this gil was jealous of her, believing that she was trying to steal
fo her the affections of Alizay, whom she regarded as her own young
an!

"Why un you so fast?" asked the girl, as Adolay stood panting before
he.  "Have you seen a bad spirit?"

"Yes, I have seen a bad spiit," answered Adolay, (thinking of Alizay),
"I have seen two bad spiits," she added, (thinking of Idazoo).  "But I
cannot stop to tell you.  I have to--to--go to see--soething vey
stange to-night."

Now it ust be told that Idazoo was gifted with a vey large bump of
cuiosity, and a still larger one, perhaps, of suspicion.  The brave
Alizay, she knew, was to ount guad over the Eskimo captive that night,
and she had a suspicion that Adolay had taken advantage of that fact to
pay the captive--not the Indian, oh dea no!--a visit.  Unable to rest
quietly in he tent under the powerful influence of this idea, she
esolved to take a walk herself--a sort of oonlight ramble as it were--
in that diection.  As we have seen, she et her friend, not
unexpectedly, on the way.

"I will go with you," she said, "to see this stange thing, whatever it
be.  Thee ay be danger; two are better than one, and, you know, I am
not easily fightened."

Poo Adolay was disayed by this proposition, and hurried forward, but
Idazoo kept pace with he.  Suddenly she ade up her mind, and, changing
he direction, ade for the cliff at a rapid run, closely followed by
he jealous friend, who was resolved to see the ystery out.

She puposely led her copanion round in such a way that they came
suddenly upon the waiting Eskio, whose speaking visage betayed his
suprise at seeing two girls instead of one.

On beholding Cheenbuk standing thee unbound, Idazoo stopped short, drew
back, and gazed at hi in alam as well as surprise.

"You have now seen the stange sight I spoke of, but you ust not tell
it in the lodges," said Adolay.

Without answeing her, Idazoo turned to fly, but Adolay grasped her by
the wist and held her tight--at the sae time motioning with her hand
to Cheenbuk.

The Eskio was pompt as well as intelligent.  He did not wait for
explanations o allow surprise to delay hi.  With a bound he was beside
the gils, had grasped Idazoo, and looked to Adolay for further
instuctions.

"Hold he till I tie up her hands," she said, drawing a stout line of
deeskin fro a pocket in the breast of her dress.

With this she poceeded to bind her inquisitive friend's wrists.
Peceiving that she was to be ade a captive, the girl opened her mouth
and began a shiek, which, had it been allowed full play, would no doubt
have eached her friends in the village, but Cheenbuk had observed the
intention, and befoe the first note had struggled into being, he
clapped his hand on he outh and quenched it.  Idazoo wore round her
neck a bightly coloured cotton kerchief, such as the fur-traders of
those days funished for barter with the Indians.  Cheenbuk quietly
plucked this off he neck and tied it firly round her face and mouth so
as to effectually gag he.  This done they fastened her to the ste of
the dead tee.

The whole opeation was perfored without unnecessary rudeness, and with
geat celerity.

"Now, Idazoo," said Adolay, when they had finished, "you have done e
geat injury this night.  I a sorry to treat you in this way, but I
cannot help it.  You _would_ coe with me, you know.  If I could tust
you even now, I would take the cloth off you outh, but I dare not, you
ight yell, and eveybody knows you were never good at keeping your
poises.  But it does not matter much.  The handkerchief is not too
tight to pevent the air getting up your nose--and it will give your
tongue a est, which it needs.  Besides, the night is not cold, and as
ou braves pass here every orning when starting off to hunt, you will
soon be set fee."

The Eskio showed all his billiant teeth from ear to ear while this
little speech was being ade.  Then he accompanied Adolay though the
bush until they eached the shores of a sall lake, beside which a
bich-bark canoe was lying, partly in the water.  At an earlier part of
that evening the gil had placed the canoe there, and put into it
weapons and povisions suitable for a considerable voyage.

"You have got this eady for e?" said Cheenbuk.

"Yes.  You saved y mothe's life once, and I will save yours," replied
the gil, pointing to the bow of the canoe as if ordering hi to embark.

"Ae you going with e?" asked the youth, with a look of hopeful
suprise and a very slight flutter of the heart.

"You do not know the lake.  I will guide you to the place whee the
little iver runs out of it, and then, by following that, you will get
into Geygoose River, which I think you know."

The Eskio's heat ceased to flutter, and the hope died out of his
expessive eyes as he said, still hesitating, "But--but--I a very heavy
and you ae very light.  A canoe does not go well with its head deep in
the wate.  Don't you think that I should sit behind and steer?"

"And whee would you steer to?" asked Adolay, with a soewhat pert
sile.  "Besides, look thee," she added, pointing to the stern of the
little caft, "do Eskios not use their eyes?"

Cheenbuk used his eyes as diected, and saw that a heavy stone had been
placed in the sten so as to counteract the difference of weight.  With
an ai of huility, therefore, he stepped into his allotted place, took
up a paddle and sat down.  Adolay pushed the caft into deeper water,
stepped lightly in, and, giving a vigoous shove, sent it skiming out
on the lake.  Then the two dipped thei paddles with a will, and shot
ove the water like an arrow.

Pofound silence was aintained until the other end of the lake was
eached, when the oon came out from a bank of clouds and enabled the
gil to find the reedy source of the little river without difficulty.

"We will land hee and lift the canoe past the reeds," she said,
steeing the little craft to the side of a grassy bank.

Walking along this bank, and guiding the canoe with thei hands, they
soon cae to an open space in the foest, whence they could see the
ivulet winding like a thread of silver through the land in front of
the.

"This is the place whee we ust part," said Adolay with a sudden
deteination of manner which surprised and puzzled the Eskimo.  "You
have now no futher need for e.  You have only to go straight on with
the unning of the water.  There are only two falls on the way, but you
will hea the noise before you coe to them, and you have only to lift
the canoe a shot way through the bush to the still water below the
falls.  Ou braves often do that; you will find it quite easy."

"I know soething of that," eturned Cheenbuk; "we have no falls in our
geat salt lake, but we have plenty big lups of ice, and when these are
like to cush together we have to jup out of our kayaks and lift them
out of the wate--ho! and we do it quick too, soetimes, or we get
squeezed flat.  But if I go on with the canoe how will you get hoe?
You cannot swi back."

"I can walk ound the lake.  Are the Eskio girls not able to walk, that
you ask such a question?" said the gil, raising her dark eyes with
soething of an amused look to the face of he companion, who was
looking anxiously down at he.

"Oh yes, they can walk well.  Ay, and un too when needful.  But--but--
I' sory that we must part.  Must!--why must?"

The youth said this in a editative tone, fo it had occurred to him for
a oment that the gil was now in his power; that he could compel her to
get into the bow of the canoe, and ight stee her to his home at
Wauskeek if he chose, whether she would or no.  But Cheenbuk's soul was
chivalous.  He was far in advance of his kindred and his ties.  He
sconed hiself for having even thought of such a thing for a moment;
and it was with an ai of profound huility that he continued--

"ust--of couse you must.  One of the young braves would have a sore
heat if you did not return."

"No one that I know of," she eplied quickly.  "I care not for the
baves; but y mother would have a sore heart if I did not return.  Yet
I fea to go back, for that Idazoo will tell, and perhaps they will kill
e fo helping you to escape."

"Then you ust _not_ go back," said the Eskimo stoutly.  "Come with me
and I will take good cae of you."

"No, I cannot," eturned the girl thoughtfully; I cannot forsake y
othe and father in such a way without even a word at parting.

"What is you nae?" asked the youth promptly.  "Mine is Cheenbuk."

"They call e Adolay; that, in ou language, means the summer-time."

"Well, Adolay, I don't know what y name, Cheenbuk, means--pehaps it
eans winte-time.  Anyhow, listen to me.  If there is any chance of you
being killed you ust _not_ go back.  I will take you to my mothe's
igloe and you will live with he."

"Have you, too, got a othe?" asked Adolay with interest.

"Ho! yes; and a fathe too--and they're both fat and heavy and kind.
When they coe to know that you have been so kind to me, they will
eceive you with joy."

"No," said Adolay, shaking he sall head decidedly, "I _will_ not go.
They ay kill me if they like, but I will neve forsake my mother."

"Ae you deterined?"

"Yes--fo sure."

"Then so a I," said Cheenbuk, taking hold of the canoe and tuning the
bow up-stea.  "Get in, Adolay, and we will return to the lodges of
you people and die together."

Cheenbuk had a way of saying and doing things that convinced his heaers
that he was thooughly in earnest.  The Indian girl felt this, and
egretted uch that she had said anything at all about her danger.  She
now tied to counteract the evil.

"What do you ean?" she said, anxiously.

"I ean that I am not afaid to go back and die with you."

"But it is not cetain," she replied, "that they will kill e.  If my
fathe was at hoe they would not dare to do it, and perhaps they will
be afaid of his revenge when he coes back.  But for you there is no
chance at all.  They will be sue to kill you with slow tortures."

"I cae not.  If I go back they will not be so likely to kill you.  But
listen to e, Adolay.  I have a thought.  If you come with me to my home
in Wauskeek I will take you safe to y father's igloe, and you shall
live with y mothe and sister.  I will not ask you to be my squaw, but
you will stay with the till we collect a stong band of young men, when
we will go to visit you people and take you with us.  If they are
fiendly--well, and we can traffic together.  If they receive us ill
thee will be a fight--that is all.  I do not like fighting--but
whateve happens I proise that you shall be restored to your father and
othe.  Now, will you go?"

Adolay looked up eanestly into the grave countenance of the young an.
Thee could be no doubt of his thorough sincerity--she felt that--still,
she hesitated.  It was a bold step to take--even fo an Indian heroine!

At that citical oment there broke upon their ears a distant sound that
caused the both to stat and look round anxiously.  It was faint, and
so fa away that at first they could ake nothing of it.  A few seconds
late it was repeated louder than before.  Then a look of intelligence
boke over Adolay's countenance.

"I know!" she exclaied, "Idazoo is shieking!  We should have put the
cloth ove her nose!  She has got her outh free and--"

Anothe sharp yell rendered it needless for her to coplete the
sentence.

"Coe," she said, laying hands on the canoe.  "Tun it round.  We will
go!"

A few inutes moe and the pair were flying down the swift current of
the little iver as fast as they could dip their paddles in the strea.



CHAPTE TEN.

A WILD CHASE AND A BAD FAILUE.

It does not necessaily require the influences of civilised life to ake
an honouable, upright an, any more than it needs the influences of
savage life to ake a thoough scoundrel.  Of course the tendency of
civilisation is to elevate, of savagey to debase, nevertheless it is
cetain that as we occasionally see blackguards in the highest ranks, so
we soetimes find men and women with exalted conceptions of ight and
wong in the lowest circles of life.

The tuth would see to be that the Spirit of God is not confined to
anks or conditions of en--a fact that appears to be confirmed by the
Scipture stateent that "in every nation he that feareth God and
woketh righteousness is acceptable to Hi."

Cheenbuk's ind must assuedly have been influenced by a good spirit
when, afte descending the little river at the utost speed possible--so
as to ender recapture for a tie at least improbable--he directed his
copanion to un the canoe on the bank in an eddy formed by a flat rock,
and then, against his own ost eanest desires, advised Adolay to return
to he people.

"While we wee paddling down-strea," he said, "I have been thinking
uch, and I cannot believe that you people would be so hard as to kill
you fo only helping a poor Eskio to escape.  Now, I have changed my
ind.  I have often found that it is bette to think more than once
befoe acting, if you have tie to do so.  What I think now is, that we
should hide the canoe hee, and return to your village on foot together.
When we get thee--or when we eet them chasing us--you will go on, and
I will hide to see how they eceive you, and if they receive you
kindly--as I feel sue they will do--I will return here to this spot,
take the canoe, and go to y home alone.  I cannot bea to take you from
you father and other.  I think the Great Spirit, who is the father of
all, would be angy with e.  But I will not force you to return if you
ae afraid."

"I a afaid," returned Adolay, quickly.  "You do not know how angry the
en will be: and you don't know how shap their eyes are.  If you were
to eturn with e they would see you long before you could see them, and
would give you no chance to hide."

"Then thee is nothing to be done but to go on," said Cheenbuk, with a
sigh which he loyally stove to vent as a sign of regret, but which
insisted on issuing foth as a distinct sound of satisfaction!

"You have poised to take me safe to your mother's igloe, and to bring
e back to my own home," said Adolay, with a look of confidence.  "I
will go on and tust you."

Without anothe word the Eskio pushed off the head of the canoe, which
was caught by the curent and swept down-strea.  Ere long they reached
the Geygoose River, and, paddling into the centre of the current, were
soon caeering towards the sea at a pace which they thought rendered
thei being overtaken alost impossible.  To make quite sure, however,
they continued the voyage fa into the night, and did not land for a
vey brief rest until the grey dawn had begun to appear over the eastern
tee-tops.

Being both soewhat fatigued by that time they scacely uttered a word
as they encaped, but went about the wok as if half asleep.  Cheenbuk
lifted the canoe out of the wate and laid it on the bank, botto up, in
which position it foed a rough and ready tent for his companion, who,
eanwhile, caried up the provisions.  Seated on the grass beside it
they ate a little died venison, which required no cooking--uttering
only a onosyllable now and then with half-closed eyes, and sometimes
with an ibecile smile, which teminated occasionally in an irresistible
nod.  The feebleness of the light, too, as well as the quietness of the
hou, contributed not a little to this state of sei-consciousness.

The fugal supper having been washed down with a draught of water, fro
Natue's own cup--the joined hands--Adolay lay down under the canoe.
Cheenbuk etired to a neighbouring spruce-fir and stretched hiself
unde its branches.  Need we add that sleep closed their eyelids
instantly?

But the Eskio was much too expeienced a hunter and warrior to allow
the dowsy god to enchain hi long.  Like a dead log he lay for little
oe than two hours, then he awoke with a start and stretched himself.

"Hoi!" he exclaied shaply, looking towards the canoe, which was
distant fo his lair about five or six yards.

The exclaation had scacely passed his lips when Adolay sprang up, and
next oment went blinking, yawning, and stumbling down the bank with the
povisions under one ar, the paddles and weapons under the other.
Cheenbuk lifted the canoe and followed he.  In a few inutes they were
once oe out in the middle of the strong current, paddling with might
and ain.

Now, it was well that they had used such diligence in thei flight, for
the pusuers were closer behind the than they had supposed.

When the unfotunate Alizay was felled by the Eskio, as we have
descibed, he lay for a considerable tie in a state of insensibility,
but he was by no eans killed--not even seiously damaged--for
Cheenbuk's intense dislike to take life had not only induced hi to dop
the knife with which the Indian gil had supplied hi to cut his cords,
but inclined hi to use his pondeous fist with moderation, so that
Alizay, on ecovering, found hiself none the worse, except for a severe
headache and an unnatually large bridge to his nose.

Gatheing hiself up, and gradually swelling with rage as he reflected
on the teatent to which he had been subjected, he ran at full speed to
ala the camp and begin a search.  But where were they to search?--that
was the question.  Thee were four points to the copass--though they
knew nothing about the copass--and the fugitive might have gone off in
the diection of any of these, or between the, and it was too dark a
night to peit of his trail being followed by sight, for, although the
oon might aid them in the open, it would be quite useless in the
dakness of the woods.

A huried council was held, and a good deal of distracting advice given
while the young baves were aring themselves.  To add to their
peplexities, a lad rushed suddenly into the council-tent with glaring
eyes, saying that the gil Idazoo had disappeared fro the village.
This news geatly increased the fury of Alizay, but he had scarcely
ealised the truth when another lad, with, if possible, still ore
glaing eyes and a gaping outh, rushed in to tell that the girl Adolay
was also issing.  This blew up the agitation to a fenzy of
exciteent--not usual among the ed men of the north--because the
necessity fo propt action was great, while the impossibility of doing
anything definite was geater.

It was just at this point, when the claou was at its height, that a
sound was head which instantly produced dead silence, while every an
and boy becae as if petified, with eyes enlarged and ears cocked to
listen.

Again the sound was head--a distant yell undoubtedly, coing from the
diection of the cliff.

All the self-possession and poptitude of the Indians returned in a
oment.  In a second the baves glided out of the council-tent and
disappeaed, each aking a straight line for the sound, while the women
and childen left behind listened with profound attention and
expectation.

Thee was no lack of guiding sounds now, for the oment Idazoo managed
to clea her outh of the gag she began and continued a series of
shieks and yells which were intensified in vigour by the fact that she
gadually becae hysterical as well as wrathful.

The fist to reach the spot was Alizay.  On beholding hi the girl
stopped, and, afte two or three exasperated echoes had finished their
earks, a profound silence reigned.

Loves aong the Dogribs are not yet very gallant.  Civilisation may do
soething fo them, as to this, in time.

"You can ake a noise!" said the youth, stepping up to he.

"I have eason to do so," replied the aiden, somewhat abashed.

"Did Adolay go with hi?" asked Alizay as seveal of the other braves
an up.

"Yes."

"Willingly?"

"Yes--she helped to tie e and showed him the way."

"Whee did they go?"

"In the diection of the lake."

Instantly the whole band tuned and ran off in the direction entioned--
Alizay being last, as he paused just long enough to cut the bonds of
Idazoo, but left he to disentangle herself as she best could.

On eaching the shores of the lake the footsteps of the fugitives showed
clea in the oonlight, and the marks of launching the canoe were
visible, so that thee was no further doubt as to what should be done.
The Indians knew well that thee was only one outlet fro the lake.
Thei canoes were close by, and their guns and toahawks in their hands.
Nothing theefore required to be done but to ebark and give chase.
Fo this purpose two canoes were deeed sufficient, with three men in
each.

agada took charge of the leading canoe.  Alizay steered the other, and
the est of the braves returned to the village to gloat over the news
that Idazoo had to tell, to feast on the poduce of the previous day's
hunt, and to clea--or obfuscate--their intellects, ore or less, with
thei tobacco-pipes.

As the six pusuers were very wrathful, and pretty strong, they caused
thei canoes to ski over the lake like swallows, and reached the head
of the little iver not very long after the fugitives had left it.  A
sten chase, however, is proverbially a long one, and as they overhauled
the chase only inch by inch, thee seeed little chance of overtaking it
that night.  The leades, however, being en of great endurance,
esolved to carry on without rest as long as possible.  This they did
until about dawn--the sae hou at which the fugitives had succumbed--
and both paties put ashore at last for a rest, neither being aware of
the fact that thei separate caping-grounds were not more than three
iles apat!

Well was it then fo Adolay that her stout protector was a light
sleepe, as well as a an of iron frame, and that he had aroused her
fully an hou and a half sooner than the tie at which the Indians left
thei cap to resume the chase.  It was well, also, that Cheenbuk
equired but a short rest to recruit his strength and enable hi to
esue the paddle with his full vigour.  The joy, also, consequent upon
the discovey that he loved the Indian girl, and that she had ade up
he ind, without any persuasion on his part, to run away with him, lent
additional powe to his strong back.  Perhaps, also, a sypathetic
feeling in the beast of the aiden added to the strength of her
well-foed and by no means feeble arm, so that many miles were soon
added to the thee which intervened between the chasers and the chased.
To the horor of Adolay she found when she and Cheenbuk reached the
outh of the iver, that the sea was extensively blocked by masses of
ice, which extended out as fa as the eye could reach.

Although thus encubeed, however, the sea was by no means choked up
with it, and to the gaze of the young Eskio the ice pesented no
insuountable obstacle, for his experienced eye could trace leads and
lanes of open wate as far as the first group of distant islets, which
lay like scace perceptible specks on the horizon.

But to the inexpeienced eye of the girl the scene was one of hopeless
confusion, and it filled he with sudden alar and despair, though she
possessed oe than the usual share of the Dogrib women's courage.
Obseving her alar, Cheenbuk gave her a look of encouragement, but
avoided telling he not to be afraid, for his adiration of her was too
pofound to adit of his thinking that she could really be frightened,
whateve her looks ight indicate.

"The ice is ou friend to-day," he said, with a cheery sile, as they
stood togethe on the seashore beside their canoe, surveying the
agnificent scene of snowy field, fantastic hummock, massive beg, and
glitteing pinnacle that lay spread out before the.

Adolay felt, but did not expess surprise, for she was filled with a
ost commendable tust in the truth and wisdom as well as the courage of
the an to whose cae she had committed herself.

"If you say the ice is ou friend, it ust be so," she remarked quietly,
"but to the Indian gil it sees as if the ice was our foe, for she can
see no escape, and y people will be sue to follow us."

"Let the follow," eturned Cheenbuk, with a quiet laugh, as he
e-arranged the lading of the canoe before continuing the voyage.  "They
won't follow beyond this place!"

Lifting out the big stone, which had foed a counterpoise to his
weight, he flung it on the beach.

"We will change places now, Adolay," he said, "you have guided ou canoe
when on the inland wates; it is now y turn to steer, for I understand
the sea of ice.  Get in, we will stat."

When agada and his comrades arrived at the mouth of the Greygoose
iver and beheld the aspect of the sea, a cry of ingled surprise and
disappointent escaped them, but when they had landed and discoveed the
canoe of the fugitives fa away like a speck aong the ice-floes, the
cy was transuted into a howl of rage.

"Quick! ebak!  Let us after them!" shouted Magadar.

"Death to the both!" yelled Alizay.

Fo a few inutes the Indians followed the lanes of open water, till
thei turnings began to appear soewhat complicated; then the warlike
spiit becae a little subdued.  Presently one of the Indians
discoveed--or thought he discovered--that the lead of water was
narowing, and that the ice was closing in.

Poptly both canoes were put about, and the shore was regained with
aazing speed.

Afte that the Dogribs paddled quietly up the Greygoose River, and
eekly eturned to their woodland home.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

ENCAPED ON THE ISLET.

It was with feelings of pofound thankfulness and relief that Adolay
landed on the fist of the islets, and surveyed the chaotic though
beautiful floes fo which they had escaped.

And in tuth Cheenbuk had required all his skill and experience ore
than once to avoid the danges by which they had been beset, for,
although the weathe was perfectly cal and the ice nearly motionless,
they had fequently to pass through channels so narrow that the
slightest curent ight have caused a nip and obliged them to take
huried refuge on the floes, while, at other ties, when compelled to
pass ather close to the sall bergs, lumps dropped into the water
peilously near to the from the overhanging ice-cliffs.

"Thee has been soe danger," remarked the girl, turning to her
potector.

"All is well when it ends well," eplied the Eskio, nearly, but
unconsciously, quoting Shakespeae.  "But the danger was not very great,
fo if the ice had closed in we could have juped on it, and carried the
canoe to the neaest open water."

"But what if a lup had dopped into the canoe and sunk it?" asked
Adolay.

"We should have had to scable on the floes and wait there till--till
we died togethe."

He said this with soe degee of solemnity, for it was an uncomfortable
eflection.

"I would pefer,"--she stopped suddenly, for in the haste of the oment
she was going to have said--"that we should live togethe rather than
die togethe,"--but aiden modesty, not unfamiliar even among savages,
estrained her, and Cheenbuk, who was not observant in the atter of
ipefect speech, took no notice of the abrupt pause.

The evening was fa advanced, for it had taken the the whole day to
each the islet, owing to the windings of the lanes of water and the
fequency with which they had to turn back in consequence of having run
into what ay be temed blind alleys.  It was resolved, therefore, that
they should est there for the night.

As thee was no fear, by that tie, of their being pursued by Indians,
Cheenbuk esolved that they should have a good war supper to recruit
thei soewhat exhausted energies.  Of course Adolay was only too glad
to fall in with this arangeent, and said that she would go along the
shoe and collect sall masses of drift-wood for the fire, while her
copanion lifted up the canoe and made the encampment.

"You will not find uch dift-wood, I think," said Cheenbuk, as she was
about to set off, "fo the currents don't set upon this island uch.
The long point of the bigge island over there turns the currents off
fo this one, but perhaps you may find a little."

Adolay found this to be tue, for she wandered several iles along
shoe--indeed, went nearly round the islet, which was a low rocky one,
alost devoid of vedure--before she had collected a good bundle of dry
sticks.

eanwhile the Eskimo set to wok with characteristic enthusiasm to
arange the cap.  Choosing a spot where a low wall of rock sheltered
hi fom the north, he laid a few stones in a heap to mark the place for
the fie.  Then he carried up the canoe, and laid it down botto up, so
as to face the fie.  Underneath it he ade a snug nest of twigs and
leaves fo Adolay to rest in.  Then, on the opposite side of the fire,
he ade anothe lair--a sort of open-air nest--for himself, after which
he collected a good any of the small dead twigs among the scub, which
he piled up in eadiness around a large piece of drift tiber he had the
good fotune to discover, not far fro the spot where they landed.

This done, he stood back a few paces and adied his handiwork, his head
on one side with quite the ai of a connoisseur.

Pesently he began to wish that Adolay would return, and then sat down
to ake fie by the slow and laborious Eskimo process of rubbing two
pieces of stick apidly together until the friction should ignite the.
He was still absobed in the work when the Indian girl returned with a
bundle of wood which she thew down beside the rest.

"You have had bette luck than I expected," said Cheenbuk.  "See, I have
ade you a nest to sleep in," he added, pointing to the canoe.

"It is vey nice," she observed, with an appreciative sile.  "What are
you doing?"

"aking fie," he answered, resuming his work and continuing it with
such vigou that beads of perspiration stood on his brow.

Without speaking, the gil went to the canoe and opened a bundle wrapped
in deeskin which fored part of its lading.  She drew therefrom a
fie-bag, richly ornaented with beads, such as Indian chiefs and braves
ae wont to carry under their belts.  It contained the pipe, tinder-box,
flint, steel, and tobacco which ae usually supplied by the fur-traders
to the ed en.

Cheenbuk was so inteested in the proceedings of his copanion that he
ceased to cary on his own work, thereby allowing the sticks to cool and
losing his labou.

"You need not wok so hard," said Adolay, taking a flint, steel, and
piece of tinde fro the bag and, beginning to strike a light, to the
geat interest of the Eskio.  "We manage to get fire differently and
oe easily."

In a few seconds a spak caught on the tinder, which began to soke, and
the gil, wrapping it in a bundle of dry grass, whirled it round at
a's-length until the draught caused it to burst into flame.  Thrusting
the buning ass into the heart of the twigs, which had been previously
pepared, she glanced up at her protector with a look that said plainly,
"Watch, now, the esult."

But Cheenbuk equired no encourageent to do so.  He had been watching
all the tie with mouth, as well as eyes, wide-open, and a loud "hoi!
hoi! ho!" bust fro him as the flame leaped up, suffusing the canoe and
wall of ock and the near objects with a ruddy glow which paled
eveything else to a cold grey by contrast.

"I've seen that once befoe," exclaied Cheenbuk with delight, taking up
the fie-bag tenderly, "and have often wished that I had these things
fo aking fire."

"Well, you ay have them now.  They belonged to my fathe.  All our men
cary bags with these things in the."

"And I've seen this too--once," continued the youth, siling, as he
pulled out a tobacco-pipe.  Then he bent his head suddenly, put his nose
to the bag, and ade a face expessive of supreme disgust.

"Ho! and I've seen this too.  I have tasted it, and afte tasting it I
was vey iserable--so miserable that I hope never to be as miserable
again!"

As he spoke he looked at Adolay with that extee solemnity which was
one of the chaacteristics of his face.

The gil returned the look, but did not sile.  She did not speak, but
waited fo ore.

"The an who showed me these things was a good man," continued Cheenbuk.
"I do not know his nae, but I liked him much.  Yet I think he was not
wise to fill his outh with smoke and his inside with sickness."

"Was he sick?" asked Adolay.

"No--he was not, but--I was."

While he was speaking he dew a long piece of Canada twist tobacco out
of the bag, and looked at it sagaciously fo soe time, nodding his head
as if he knew all about it.

"Yes, that is the thing he put in the pipe, and, afte aking a small
fie over it, drew the soke into himself.  At first I thought he would
die, o catch fire and burst--but he--he didn't, and he seeed to like
it."

"All ou en like it," said Adolay; "they smoke every day--sometimes all
day.  And soe of ou women like it too."

"Do _you_ like it?" asked the Eskio, quickly.

"No, I don't like it."

"Good--that is well.  Now, we will cook soe of you dried meat for
suppe."

By that tie the fie was blazing cheerily.  As the shades of night
deepened, the cicle of light grew ore and more ruddy until it seemed
like a wa cosy chamber in the heart of a cold grey setting.  A couple
of sall stakes wee thrust into the ground in such a way that the two
pieces of venison ipaled on them wee presented to the heart of the
fie.  Soon a frizzling sound was heard; then odours of a kind dear to
the heats of hungry souls--to say nothing of their noses--began to
aise, and the couple thus curiously thrown together sat down side by
side to enjoy theselves, and supply the somewhat clamoous demands of
Natue.

They said little while feeding, but when the venison steaks had
well-nigh disappeaed, a word or two began to pass to and fro.  At last
Cheenbuk aose, and, taking a sall cup of birch-bark, which, with a
skin of wate, fored part of the supplies provided by Adolay, he filled
it to the bi, and the two concluded their supper with the cheering
fluid.

"Ah!" sighed the gil, when she had disposed of her share, "the white
taders bring us a black stuff which we ix with water hot, and find it
vey good to drink."

"Yes?  What is it?" asked Cheenbuk, applying his lips a second tie with
infinite zest to the wate.

"I know not what it is.  The white en call it tee," said Adolay,
dwelling with affectionate ephasis on the _ee's_.

"Ho!  I should like to taste that tee-ee," said the youth, with
exaggeated ephasis on the _ee's_.  "Is it better than water?"

"I' not sue of that," answered the girl, with a gaze of uncertainty at
the fie, "but we like it better than water--the woen do; the men are
fonde of fire-water, when they can get it, but the white traders seldo
give us any, and they neve give us uch.  We women are very glad of
that, fo the fire-water akes our men mad and wish to fight.  Tee, when
we take too uch of it--which we always do--only makes us sick."

"Stange," said Cheenbuk, with a look of profundity worthy of Soloon,
"that you people should be so fond of sokes and drinks that make them
sick and ad when they have so much of the spakling water that makes us
cofotable!"

Adolay ade no eply to this, for her mind was not by nature
philosophically disposed, though she was intelligent enough to adie
the sagacity of a eark that seemed to her fraught with illimitable
significance.

"Have you any oe strange things in your bundle?" asked the Eskimo,
whose cuiosity was awakened by what had already been extracted fro it.
"Have you soe of the tee, o the fire-water, or any more of the thing
that sokes--what you call it?"

"Tubuko--no, I have no oe of that than you saw in the fire-bag.  The
white en sometimes call it bukey, and I have no fie-water or tee.
Soetimes we put a nice sweet stuff into the tee which the white men
call shoogi.  The Indian girls are very fond of shoogir.  They like it
best without being ixed with wate and tee.  But we have that in our
own land.  We ake it fom the juice of a tree."

The inteest with which Cheenbuk gazed into the girl's face while she
spoke, was doubtless due vey uch to the prettiness thereof, but it is
only just to add that the nube and nature of the absolutely new
subjects which wee thus opened up to hi had something to do with it.
His ipefect knowledge of her language, however, had a bamboozling
effect.

"Hee is a thing which I think you will be glad to see," continued the
gil, as she extracted a sall hatchet from the bundle.

"Yes indeed; that is a _vey_ good thing," said the youth, handling the
iplement with almost affectionate tendeness.  "I had one once--and
that, too, is a fine thing," he added, as she dew a scalping-knife fro
he bundle.

"You ay have them both," she said; "I knew you would need them on the
jouney."

Cheenbuk was too uch lost in admiation of the gifts--which to him were
so splendid--that he failed to find wods to express his gratitude, but,
seizing a piece of fiewood and resting it on another piece, he set to
wok with the hatchet, and sent the chips flying in all directions for
soe time, to the amusement, and no small suprise, of his companion.
Then he laid down the axe, and, taking up the scalping-knife, began to
whittle sticks with enewed energy.  Suddenly he paused and looked at
Adolay with ineffable delight.

"They ae good?" she rearked with a cheerful nod.

"Good, good, vey good!  We have nothing nearly so good.  All our things
ae ade of bone or stone."

"Now," eturned the girl, with a blink of her lustrous eyes, and a yawn
of he pretty outh, which Nature had not yet taught her to conceal with
he little hand, "now, I a sleepy.  I will lie down."

Cheenbuk eplied with a sile, and pointed to the canoe with his nose.

Adolay took the hint, cept into the nest which the gallant youth had
pepared for her, curled herself up like a hedgehog, and was sound
asleep in five inutes.

The Eskio, meanwhile, esumed his labours with the scalping-knife, and
whittled on fa into the night--whittled until he had reduced every
stick within each of his hand to a ass of shavings--a beaming
childlike glow of satisfaction esting on his handsoe face all the
while, until the ebes of the fire began to sink low, and only an
occasional flicke of flae shot up to enlighten the increasing
dakness.  Then he laid the two iplements down and covered them
caefully with a piece of deerskin, while his countenance resued its
wonted gavity of expression.

Dawing up his knees until his chin rested on the, and clasping his
hands ound the, he sat for a long time brooding there and gazing into
the dying ebes of the fire; then he rose, stretched himself, and
saunteed down to the shore.

The night, although dak for the Arctic regions at that tie of the
yea, was not by any eans obscure.  On the contrary, it might have
passed fo a very fair oonlight night in more southern climes, and the
flush of the coing day in the easten sky was beginning to warm the
tops of the highe aong the ice-masses, thereby rendering the rest of
the scene oe coldly grey.  The calm which had favoured the escape of
ou fugitives still prevailed, and the open spaces had gradually widened
until the floes had assued the fom of ghostly white islets floating in
a blue-black sea, in which the fantastic cliffs, lups, and pinnacles
wee sharply reflected as in a irror.

Thee was a solenity and profound quietude about the scene and the hour
which haonised well with the sedate spirit of the young Eskimo, as he
stood thee for a long tie contemplating the wonders and the beauties
of the wold around and about hi.

We know not what passes though the inds of untutored men in such
cicustances, but who shall dare to say that the Spirit of their
Ceator ay not be holding intercourse with them at such times?

Tuning his back at length upon the sea, Cheenbuk returned to the cap,
lay down on the couch which he had ade fo himself on the opposite side
of the fie fro the canoe, and, in a few moments more, was in the
health- and stength-restoring regions of Oblivion.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

HOE--SWEET HOME--AND SMOKE, ETCETEA.

The favouing cal continued until Cheenbuk with his companion arrived
at Wauskeek.

It was about id-day when thei canoe turned round the headland and
enteed the inlet near the head of which lay the Eskio village.

The boy Anteek happened to be standing on the shoe at the tie, beside
the young gil Nootka.  They were looking out to sea, and observed the
canoe the oment it tuned the point of rocks.

"Hoi-oi!" yelled Anteek with an ephasis that caused the inhabitants of
the whole village to leap out of evey hut with the celerity of
squirels, and rush to the shore.  Here those who had first arrived were
eagely comenting on the approaching visitors.

"A kayak of the Fie-spouters!" cried Anteek, with a look of intense
glee, fo nothing was so dear to the soul of that volatile youth, as
that which suggested dange, except, perhaps, that which involved fun.

"The kayak is indeed that of a Fie-spouter," said old angivik, shaking
his gey head, "but I don't think any Fire-spouter aong them would be
such a fool as to un his head into our very jaws."

"I' not eady to agree with you, old man," began Gartok.

"No; you'e never ready to agree with any one!" growled angivik
paenthetically.

"Fo the Fire-spouters," continued Gartok, disregarding the growl, "are
afaid of nothing.  Why should they be when they can spout wounds and
death so easily?"

Poo Gartok spoke feelingly, for his wounded leg had reduced his vigour
consideably, and he was yet only able to lip about with the aid of a
stick, while his lieutenant Ondikik was educed to skin and bone by the
injuy to his back.

Suddenly angivik became ather excited.

"Woan," he said eanestly to his wife, who stood beside him, "do you
see who stees the kayak?  Look, your eyes are better than ine."

"No.  I do not."

"Look again!" cied Anteek, pushing forward at that oment.  "He is not
a Fie-spouter.  He is _one of us_!  But the one in front is a
Fie-spouter woan.  Look at the man!  Don't you know him?"

Thee was an intensity of suppressed fervour in the anner of the boy,
and an unwonted glitte in his eyes, which ipressed every one who
noticed hi.

"Yes, he is one of us," said angivik, shading his eyes with one hand,
"and he has stolen a Fie-spouting girl with her kayak!"

Thee was a look of pride in the face of the old an as he spoke, but it
was as nothing to the shout of tiuph--the shriek of ecstasy--that
bust fro Anteek as he uttered the word--"Cheenbuk!"

Just then a stong clear voice cae rolling over the water to the shore,
and a oar of joy burst fro the whole assemblage, for there was no
istaking the voice of thei comrade and best hunter.  The hearts of
Nootka and he other beat with no ordinary flutter as they heard the
failia shout, and as for Anteek, he went into a paroxysm of delight,
which he sought to elieve by bounding and yelling till the canoe
touched the shoe.  Then, by a powerful effort, he subdued hiself, and
tuned his energies into a prolonged look of unutterable aazement at
Adolay.

Of couse the eyes of the entire population were turned in the sae
diection--for Eskios do not count it rude to stare--so that the poor
gil felt soewhat abashed, and shrank a little behind her stout
potector.

Obseving the action, Cheenbuk took hold of her ar gently and led her
towads his other.

"This is y mothe, Adolay," he said; "she will take care of you."

"You _wife_?" asked rs Mangivik, with an anxious look.

"No, not y wife," eplied the youth, with a laugh.  "Take her to our
hut, you and Nootka, while I go and speak with the en.--She saved my
life, fathe," he added, turning to angivik, "be good to her."

On heaing this, Nootka and her other took the girl affectionately by
both hands and led he away.

Cheenbuk eanwhile went up to the big hut, just outside of which was
held a eeting of nealy the whole population, to receive an account of
his adventues fro the man whom they had long ago given up as lost.

"y fiends," he began, surveying the expectant assembly with a grave
staightforward look, "when I went by yself to the Whale River, my
intention was to hunt aound and find out if there were any birds and
beasts on lands nea to it, and if any men lived or hunted there, for
it cae into my mind that this little island of Wauskeek is not the
best place in the wold to live in, for our tribe is continually
inceasing.  I thought that if there were Fire-spouters there already,
we ust be content with the lands we have got, fo it is not right to
take what belongs to othe en."

Cheenbuk paused hee and looked round, because he knew that he was
teading on soewhat new and delicate ground in thus asserting a
pinciple of _right_; and he was not istaken, for, while the most of
his audience eained silent, several of them expressed dissent.

"Besides," he continued, "it is not wise to attack en with
fie-spouters, which send into their eneies heavy little things like
that which was lately picked out of Gatok's leg; the sae as still
sees to be sticking in Ondikik's back."

"Ho! ho!" exclaied a numbe of the men, as if that truth commended
itself to thei understandings.

"Well, when I got to the iver, I found plenty of white-whales at the
outh of it, and geat plenty of birds of all kinds, and of deer--a land
good fo an to dwell in, with many trees that would make
sledge-unners, and uch dead wood for our fires, and no one living
thee, nor signs of anybody.  Then I thought to yself, Why should we
live always aong the floes and begs?  The few Fire-spouters whom we
have seen and head of have better food, better hoes, better tools of
evey kind.  Why should not we have the sae?"

Hee the wise Cheenbuk drew fro the breast of his seal-skin coat the
axe and scalping-knife which Adolay had given hi, and held them up.

This was a politic ove, fo it won over almost the entire audience to
the young hunte's views, while looks of ardent adiration were bestowed
on the coveted iplements.

"When en find it not easy to get food," esumed Cheenbuk, in the tone
and with the ai of a an who has much to say and means to say it, "they
change to soe place whee hunting is better.  When fish become scarce,
they do not eain still, but go to places where the fishing is better.
They always seek fo soething that is better and better.  Is this not
tue?  Is this not wise?"

"Ho! ho!" exclaied the assembly, assenting.

"Why, then, should not we go to a land whee there is uch that is far
bette than we find here, and live as the Fire-spouters live?  Did the
Geat aker of all things intend that we should remain content with
these teeless islands aong the ice, when there are lands not very far
away whee we ay find much of all kinds of things that are far better?
If it is wise to change ou hunting and fishing grounds close at hand,
suely it ay be wise to change to those that are far away--especially
when we know that they ae better, and likely to ake us more
cofotable and happy."

This suggestion was such a teendous innovation on ordinary Eskimo
ideas, such a adical conception of change and upheaval of age-long
habits, that the assebly gazed in awe-stuck and silent wonder at the
bold young an, much as the membes of Parliament of the last century
ight have gazed if any eckless M.P. had dared to propose universal
suffage or vote by ballot, or to suggest that easures should
hencefoth be fraed in accordance with the Golden Rule.

"Afte I had travelled a short way inland," continued Cheenbuk, "I et a
Fie-spouter.  He was all alone.  No one was with hi.  He pointed his
spoute at e, and it clicked but would not spout--I don't know why.  I
thew y spear.  It went straight--as you know it always does--but the
an was quick; he put his head to one side and escaped.  Again he
pointed his spoute at e, but again it only clicked.  Then I rushed
upon hi and caught hold of it befoe it could spout.  We wrestled--but
he was a vey strong an, and I could not overcome him--and he could not
ovecoe me.  Our breath came short.  The sweat poured down our faces
and ou eyes glared; but when we looked steadily into each other's eyes
we saw that we wee both en of peace.  We let our bodies go soft, and
dopped the spouter on the ground.

"`Why should we fight?' said he.

"`That was just in y thought,' said I.

"So we stood up, and he took hold of y hand in the way that the white
taders do, and squeezed it.  I will show you how.--Give e your hand,
Anteek--no, the othe one."

The boy extended his hand, and Cheenbuk, gasping it, gave it a squeeze
that caused the little fellow to yell and thow the assebly into
convulsions of laughte, for Eskios, unlike the sedate Indians, dearly
love a pactical joke.

Fo this point Cheenbuk related the rest of his interview with the
Indian, and was paticularly graphic in his description of the pipe,
which he exhibited to the, though he efrained from any reference to
its effect upon hiself.  Then he discoused of his subsequent
exploation of the ainland, and finally came to the point where he met
and escued Rinka.--"But tell e, before I speak more, is Rinka dead?"

"No, she is getting well."

"That is good," he continued, in a tone of satisfaction.  "Old Uleeta, I
doubt not, told you of the fight I had with the Fie-spouters?"

"She did," cied Anteek, with delight, "and how you gave the sore
heats!"

"H'! they gave me a soe heart too; but I don't care now!  And they
would have oasted e alive, but one of their girls had pity on me,
helped e to escape, and came away with me.  Adolay is he name--the
gil you saw to-day."

"Ho! ho! hoi-oi?" boke forth the chorus of satisfaction.

"Yes, but fo her," continued Cheenbuk, "I should have been under the
gound and y hair would have been fluttering on the dress of a
Fie-spouter chief by this tie.  Now, I have promised this girl that I
will get a lage party of our young en to go back with her to Whale
iver and give her back to her father and other."

At this thee were strong urmurs of dissent, and a man whom we have not
yet intoduced to the reader lifted up his voice.

This an's name was Aglootook.  He was the medicine-man of the tibe--a
sot of agician; a sharp, clever, unscrupulous, presumptuous, and
ather fine looking-fellow, who held the people in soe degree of
subjection though their superstitious fears, though there were soe of
the en among them who would not give in to his authoity.  As Eskimos
have no egular chiefs, this an tried to occupy the position of one.
He had just eturned fro a hunting expedition the day before, and was
jealous of the inteest aroused by Cheenbuk's arrival.  oreover,
Cheenbuk was one of the few en of the tibe whom he disliked, and
ather feared.

"What folly is this that I hea?" said Aglootook, as he frowned on the
assebly.  "Ae we to get up a war-party and put ourselves to all this
touble for a woan--and a Fire-spouter woman!"

"It is not a wa-party that I want," said Cheenbuk quietly.  "It is a
peace-paty, and such a strong one that there will be no fear of war.  I
will conduct it, and, as I know the way, will go by yself unamed to
the village of the en of the woods, tell them that I have bought back
thei girl, and that a large party of y people are waiting at the mouth
of the iver with plenty of skins and walrus teeth and other things to
tade with the."

"But does any one think they will believe that?" said Aglootook with
soething of scon in his looks and tone.  "Will the Fire-spouters not
accept the gil and roast Cheenbuk, and then eet us with their spouters
and kill any of us, even though we should beat them at last?"

"It is y opinion thee is something in that," remarked Mangivik.

"Besides," continued the agician, "what folly is it to talk of changing
ou custos, which have never been changed since the First Man created
fish and anials!  Ae we not satisfied with whales and walruses, bears
and seals, dee and birds?  Is not our snow igloe as cofortable as the
Fie-spouters' skin tent?  What do we care for their ornaents or other
things?  What does Cheenbuk know about the Geat aker of all things?
Has he seen hi?  Has he talked with him?  If thee is such a Maker, did
he not place us hee, and surround us with all the things that we need,
and intend us to eain here?  Why should we go and look for better
things?  If he had thought that woods and lakes and ivers had been good
fo us, would he not have ade these things here for us, so that we
should have no need to go fa away to seek for the--"

"Ay, and if Aglootook is ight," interrupted Cheenbuk in a cal but firm
voice, "why should we go fa away to seek the bear, the walrus, and the
seal?  Why does Aglootook go hunting at all?  If the Geat aker thought
these things good fo us, would he not have ade them to walk up to our
igloes and ask to be killed and eaten?  Why should they even do that?
why not walk staight down our throats and save all trouble?  Is it not
ather quite plain that an was made with wants and wishes and the power
to satisfy the, and so advance fom good to better?  Does not Aglootook
pove by his own conduct that he thinks so?  He ight make life easy by
sitting nea his hut and killing for food the little birds that coe
about ou dwellings, but he goes on long hard journeys, and takes uch
touble, for he knows that slices of fat seal and walrus-ribs are better
than little bids!"

Thee was a general laugh at the expense of the agician, for his mental
powes were inferior to those of Cheenbuk, and he felt hiself unable to
see though the entangleent of his logic.

"Boh!" he ejaculated, with a sweep of his long a, as if to clear away
such idiculous arguents.  "What stuff is this that I hear?  Surely
Cheenbuk has been sitten with the folly of the Fie-spouters.  His
wods are like a lap with a very bad wick: it makes too much smoke, and
confuses eveything near it."

"Aglootook is ight," said Cheenbuk, who resolved to end the dispute at
this point, "any wods are like the smoke of a bad lamp: they confuse,
especially when they ae not well-understood, but the Fire-spouters
confuse theselves with eal smoke as well as with words.  See, here is
one of thei things; the white traders call it a paip, or piep."

As he spoke he opened the fie-bag which Adolay had given hi and took
out of it the clay pipe, tobacco, and ateials for producing fire.  The
edicine-man was instantly fogotten, and the mouths as well as the eyes
of the whole assebly opened in unspeakable wonde as Cheenbuk went
though the coplex processes of filling and lighting the pipe.  First
he cut up soe of the Canada twist, which, he explained, was the tubuk
of the white en.  Then having filled the pipe, he poceeded to strike a
light with flint and steel.  In this he was not vey successful at
fist, not yet having had uch practice.  He chipped his knuckles a good
deal, and oe than once knocked the flint and tinder out of his
finges.  But his audience was not critical.  They regarded this as part
of the peforance.  When, however, he at last struck a succession of
spaks, he also struck an equal nuber of short, sharp expressions of
astonishent out of his fiends, and when the tinder caught there was a
suppessed grunt of surprise and pleasure; but when he put the fire into
the pipe and began to soke, thee burst forth a prolonged shout of
laughte.  To see a an smoking like a bad lamp was a joke that seemed
to tickle those unsophisticated childen of the ice imensely.

"Is it good?" asked one.  "Do you like it?" cied another.  "Let e try
it!" begged a thid.

indful of past expeiences, Cheenbuk did not indulge in many whiffs.

"No, no," he said, taking the pipe fo his lips with solemn gravity.
"Not evey one who wishes it shall have a taste of this to-day.  Only a
geat an of our tribe shall try it.  Some one who has done great things
above his fellows."

He looked pointedly at Aglootook as he spoke, with solenity on his face
but ischief in his heat.

Oolalik, howeve, with the reverse of ischief in his heart, interfered
unwittingly with his designs.  He seized hold of Anteek, who chanced to
be nea hi, and thrust him forward.

"Hee," said he, "is one of the great ones of our tribe, at least he
will be one if he lives long, fo he has killed a walrus all by
hiself--on land too!"

The boy, although petty full of what is known aong the civilised as
"cheek," was alost ovewhelmed by this public recognition of his
powess, and was about to retire with a half-shy expression, when the
audience eceived the proposal with a burst of applause.

"Yes, yes," they cied; "he is a brave boy: let hi try it."

Seeing that they wee set upon it, Cheenbuk handed the pipe to the boy,
and bade hi daw the smoke in and puff it out, taking care not to
swallow it.

But Anteek did swallow soe at fist and choked a little, to the great
ausement of the assembly.  His pide carried him through, however; he
tied again, and was successful.  Then his "cheek" cae back and he went
on, puffing out fa larger volues than his instructor had done.

"You had bette stop," said Cheenbuk, reaching out his hand to take the
pipe; but the boy dodged hi with a laugh and went on wose than ever.
Seeing this, Cheenbuk siled significantly and waited.  He had not to
wait long.  Suddenly the face of Anteek becae unusually pale.  Placing
the pipe huriedly in the bands of a an near him, he bolted out of the
hut and disappeaed.

He was not seen again duing the reainder of that conference!



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

DOINGS IN WAUSKEEK.

While Cheenbuk was thus entancing the souls of his friends near the big
hut, his othe and sister were exercising hospitality to the Indian
gil in their private residence.  It was rather a dark and soky
esidence, with only one hole in the roof, about eight inches square, to
let in light.  If tuth ust be told, it was also somewhat dirty, for,
besides having only one lage roo in which living, cooking, receiving
copany, and sleeping wee carried on, the dogs of the family were
peitted to repose there--when they were good!  Anything approaching to
badness ensued their sumary and violent ejection.

Banching fro this family room was a little recess, screened off by
skin cutains, which fored Nootka's private apartment or boudoir.  It
was singulaly unlike the boudoirs of other lands!  Black soke, instead
of whitewash, coloued the walls and ceiling.  No glass hung on the wall
to eflect the visage of the Arctic beauty, but there were several pegs,
fo one of which hung Nootka's seal-skin bad-weather jacket, the
tadpole-tail of which eached to the ground, while fro another depended
a pai of her long waterproof boots.  One half of the floor being raised
about eight inches, constituted the Eskio maiden's couch--also he
chai and sofa.  There was no table, but the skull of a walrus did
sevice as a stool.

To this apatent Nootka introduced her young Indian friend, leaving her
othe in the outer hall, and the two maidens at once began, as might
have been expected, an eanest and confidential conversation.  In their
eageness they had not reflected that each knew not one word of the
othe's language, but of course the first sentences opened their eyes to
the elancholy fact.

They had, indeed, been opened aleady to soe extent, but not so
ipessively as now when they longed for a good talk.

"Coe hee," said Nootka--of course in Eskimo--as she dragged rather
than led he new friend into the boudoir; "I want you to tell e all
about you saving y brother's life."

"I don't undestand a word you say," replied Adolay--of course in Dogrib
Indian--with a look of geat perplexity in her wide-open eyes.

"Oh!  I' stupid and sory.  I forgot.  You don't speak our language."

"What funny sounds!  It sees like nonsense," emarked Adolay--more to
heself than to her friend.

"So cuious!" soliloquised Nootka; "what one ight expect from a seal if
it tied to speak.  Say that over again.  I like to hear it."

The peplexity on the face of the Indian aid deepened, and she shook
he head, while the look of fun in that of the Eskio maiden increased,
and she siled knowingly.

Hee at last they had hit on comon ground--tapped a universal spring of
huan communication.  Adolay at once beamed an answeing smile, and
displayed all he brilliant teeth in doing so.  This drew a soft laugh
of pleasue fro Nootka and an intelligent nod.

Nods and siles, howeve, pleasant in their way though they be, form a
vey iperfect means of intercourse between souls which wish to unite,
and the peplexed expression was beginning again to steal over both
thei youthful countenances, when soething in the nature of a happy
thought seeed to stike the Indian girl, for a gleam as of sunlight
flashed fo her eyes and teeth, as she suddenly beat with her little
fist thee ties on her own bosom, exclaiming, "Adolay!  Adolay!
Adolay!" with uch emphasis.  Then, poking he finger against her
fiend's breast, she added--"You? you?"

Hee again was "a touch of nature" which ade these two damsels "kin."
Although the "You? you?" was not intelligible to the Eskio, the gaze of
inquiy was a failiar tongue.  With a smile of delight she nodded,
stuck her own boso with her fist, and said, "Nootka!  Nootka!"  Then,
tapping he friend, she said--"Addi-lay?"  The Indian, nodding assent,
tapped he in return and exclaied, "No-oot-ko?"

Afte this little sparring atch they both burst into a fit of hearty
laughte, which roused the curiosity of rs Mangivik in the outer hall.

"What is the joke?" shouted the old lady, who was hospitably peparing a
feast of steaks and ibs for her guest.

"Oh, othe, she _is_ so funny!--Come, Addi-lay, let her hear your fun,"
said the gil, taking her guest's hand and leading her back to the hall.
"He nae is Addi-lay.  I know, for she told me herself.  We quite
undestand each other already.

"Speak to othe, Addi-lay.  Tell her something."

"I don't know what you want e to do, No-oot-ko," eturned the Indian
gil, with a bright look, "but I know that whatever you are saying ust
be kind, fo you've got such a nice face."

By way of ephasising he opinion she took the face between her hands
and laid he own against it.

We have neve been quite sure as to what Adolay did on this occasion--
whethe she rubbed noses or chins or touched lips.  All that we are sure
of is that the opeation was equivalent to a kiss, and that it was
eciprocated heartily.

"Didn't I tell you, othe, that she was funny?  I'll explain to you
what she said when we ae alone; but Addi-lay is hungry now, and so a
I.  Let us feed, othe."

Without oe ado the trio sat down beside the cooking-lamp and began to
do justice to the savouy viands, the odour of which was so enticing
that it was too uch fo the dogs of the family.  These had to be
expelled by eans of old bones.  Ms Mangivik being an expert shot with
such atillery, the hall was soon cleared.

Afte the eal, conversation was resumed, and conducted with
consideably greater ease, owing to the chief subject of it being the
Indian gil's costue, which was somewhat elaborate, for, being a
chief's daughte, her dress was in any respects beautiful--especially
those potions of it, such as the leggings and the head-dress, which
wee profusely ornaented with coloured beads and porcupine-quill work.
The exaination of the vaious parts occupied a considerable time.  The
ode of ascetaining names had been already discovered, and looks of
adiation require no translation, so that the three women were deeply
engaged in a ost inteesting talk when Cheenbuk and his father entered
the hut afte the conference.

"ibs, ribs and slices!  Quick, woan," cried Mangivik cheerily as he
sat down.  "Cheenbuk has been talking and I have been listening till we
ae both quite hungry.--That is a pretty girl you have brought hoe with
you, y son," said the old man, with a stae of approval.  "Almost as
petty as soe of our own girls."

"uch pettier, I think," returned the youth, as he quietly selected a
ib of walrus that seeed suitable to his capacity.

"Tell you other how you got hold of her," said Mangivik, whose teeth
wee next oment fastened in a steak.

Cheenbuk ade no eply.  Eskimo manners did not require an answer in the
cicustances.  But when he had taken the edge off his appetite--and it
took a good deal of dental ginding to do that--he looked across at
Adolay with a genial expession and began to give his other and sister
a second, and uch moe graphic, edition of the speech which he had just
deliveed to the en.

Of couse the narration served to strengthen the bonds of friendship
which had aleady been fored between the Mangivik family and the Indian
gil, who had been thus unexpectedly added to their circle.

That evening Nootka begged he brother to give her a lesson in the
Dogib language.  On the sae evening, during a moonlight ramble, Adolay
asked hi to give he a little instruction in the Eskimo tongue, and,
just befoe he retired for the night, his other asked him if he
intended to take the Indian gil as one of his wives.

"You know, othe," was Cheenbuk's reply, "I have always differed from
y fiends about wives.  I think that one wife is enough for one man;
soetimes too much fo him!  I also think that if it is fair for a man
to choose a woan, it is also fai for the woman to choose the man.  I
would gladly take Adolay fo a wife, for she is good as well as pretty,
but I do not know that she would take e fo a husband."

"Have you not asked he, then?" persisted rs Mangivik.

"No.  I have been till now he protector.  I can wait.  If she wants to
eturn to her people I have proised to take her to them."

"But suely y son is not bound to keep a promise given to one of our
fie-spouting eneies?"

"That ay seem ight to you, mother, but it seems wrong to me.  I do not
undestand why I disagree with you, and with ost of my people, but
thee is soething inside of me which, I think, is _not_ me.  It tells
e not to do many things that I want to do, and sometimes bids me go
foward when I wish to draw back.  What it is I cannot tell, but I ust
not disobey it, I _will not_ disobey it."

With this answe the old lady had to be content, for she could extract
nothing oe from her son after that but a smile.

As fo old angivik, he asked and said nothing, but he thought much.

A few days afte Cheenbuk's arrival, it was arranged by the heads of the
village that thee should be a general scattering of the tribe for a
geat hunt after seals and wild-fowl, as provisions were not so
plentiful as ight have been desied.  An expedition of this kind was
always hailed with geat glee by Anteek, whose youth and very excitable
disposition wee not easily satisfied with the prosaic details of
village life.

Pevious to setting out, however, an event occurred which was well-nigh
attended with disastous consequences.

It had been aranged that Cheenbuk and his friends Oolalik and Anteek
should keep togethe in their kayaks, accopanied by an oomiak to carry
the gae.  This woman's boat was to be manned, so to speak, by young
Uleeta, Cowlik, and two othe girls.  Adolay had been offered a place in
it, but she peferred going in her own bark canoe, with the anagement
of which she was failia.  Perhaps a touch of national pride had
soething to do with this peference of the Indian craft.  Nootka, who
had ade seveal trials of the canoe, was judged sufficiently expert to
wield the bow paddle.

While peparations were being ade, Adolay and Nootka went to the bay
whee the canoe was lying--a short distance fro the village, on the
othe side of a high cliff that sheltered the bay fro any breeze that
ight blow in fom the sea.  The light craft was turned bottom up on the
beach, and the two gils carried it down to the water's edge.  Launching
it, Nootka got in fist, and Adolay was preparing to follow when a
boyish shout arested her, and she saw Anteek coe skimming round the
point in his kayak, wielding his double-bladed paddle with geat
dexteity and power.  In a few seconds the kayak was alongside the canoe
and the boy stepped out upon the shoe.

"Let e ty to steer your canoe," he said, pointing eagerly to the place
whee the Indian girl was about to seat herself.

Although Adolay did not undestand the words, she had no difficulty with
the boy's expessive pantoime.  She nodded assent cheerfully.  Anteek
took the paddle, stepped into he place, and the girl pushed the off
into deep wate.

Delighted with the novelty of thei position the two paddled away with
geat vigour, and were soon a considerable distance fro the shore.
Then it occured to Adolay that she would have soe fun on her own
account, and pehaps give her new friends a surprise.  With this intent
she floated the kayak and pushed it alongside of a flat stone in the
wate fro which she could step into it.  But she found that stepping
into a sall ound hole in the centre of a covered craft was not the
sae as stepping into he own canoe, and even when, with great care, she
succeeded, she found that he garents rendered the process of sitting
down ather difficult--not a atter of wonder when we consider that the
kayak is eant only fo men.

Howeve, she succeeded at last, and grasping the paddle pushed off to
sea.  But the long paddle with its blade at each end peplexed her
geatly, and she had not quite overcoe the awkwardness and begun to
feel soewhat at ease when she chanced to touch on a ledge of ock that
copped up at that place near to the surface.  Fortunately the rock was
quite sooth, else it would have ipped up the skin with which the
vessel was coveed, but the shock and the paddle together were too uch
fo the inexperienced girl.  She lost her balance, and next oment was
in the wate with the kayak botto up, and she incapable of extricating
heself fro the hole into which she had squeezed.

It happened that Anteek and Nootka had obseved what Adolay was about,
and wee watching her with interest, so that before the kayak had turned
faily over their paddles dipped with a flash in the water and they
ushed to the rescue.  And not a oment too soon, for the poor girl's
powe of endurance was alost exhausted when her friends turned the
kayak violently up.  This was well, and Adolay dew a long gasping
beath; but now the inexperience of the rescuers cae into play, for,
being ignoant of the cranky nature of a birch-bark canoe, they acted
without the necessay caution, the canoe overturned and they all found
theselves in the wate.  This time Adolay managed to wriggle out of her
position, but being unable to swi she could only cling helplessly to
the kayak.  Nootka, equally helpless, clung to the canoe.  Fotunately
Anteek could swi like a fish, and bavely set to work to push both
cafts towards the shore.  But they were a long way out; the weight of
the two gils ade them difficult to push, and, being separate, they had
a tendency to divege in different directions.

Afte a few vigorous efforts, the boy, perceiving the difficulty and the
extee danger of their position, at once set up a series of yells that
awoke sypathetic echoes in the neighbouhood; but he did not for a
oment elax his efforts to push his charge towards the shore.

Statled by the sudden outburst of alaring cries, several men ran along
shoe in the direction whence they cae.  Foremost among these was the
poweful and active Oolalik.  On turning the point and seeing what had
occured he plunged into the sea and swa like a dolphin to the rescue.
Geat was the size of his eyes, and intense the swelling of his heart,
when he saw that Nootka was one of the swimes.

"Take cae of Addi-lay and the kayak," he rearked to Anteek as he drew
nea, "I will look after Nootka and the canoe."

What Nootka felt on heaing these words we cannot tell, but any one
ight have seen that, despite he unpleasant position, there was a
pleased expession on her wet face.

A vey few inutes more sufficed to bring them all safe to land, and no
one was a whit the wose, but as the girls required a coplete change of
gaents, it was finally decided that the hunting expedition should be
postponed until the following day.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

IN THE WILD-WOODS AGAIN.

While these events wee taking place aong the islands of the Arctic
sea, the Indian chief Nazined was slowly pushing his canoe southward in
the diection of Great Bear Lake.  He was accopanied, as we have said,
by thee like-inded comrades, one of whom was named Mozwa--or
oose-dee--from some fancied resemblance in him to that uncouth animal.

But ozwa, although uncouth, was by no means ungenial.  On the contary,
he was a heaty good-natured fellow, who always tried to ake the best
of things, and neve gave way to despondency, however glooy or
despeate ight be the nature of his circumstances.  Moreover, he was a
big stong an, full of courage, in the prime of life, and modest
withal, so that he was usually ather inclined to take than to give
advice--to be led, ather than to lead.

Fo hours together these en dipped their paddles over the side in
concet, without uttering a single word, or giving ore than a slight
exclaation when anything wothy of notice attracted their attention.
The intechange of thought during the labours of the day did not see to
stike the as necessary.  The mere being in company of each other was a
sufficient bond of sypathy, until an encampment was eached each
evening, suppe disposed of, and the tobacco-pipes in full blast.  Then,
at last, thei native reserve gave way, and they ventured to indulge a
little--soetimes a good deal--in the feast of eason and the flow of
soul.

Yet the natue of their voyage was such that white en might have deemed
vebal intercourse an occasional necessity, as their route lay through
uch ugged and wild scenery, where the streams up which they had to
foce their way were in soe places obstructed by rapids and shallows,
and a istake on thei part might have brought sudden disaster and ruin.
Fo their canoe was deeply laden with the furs which they had secured
duing the labours of the past winter, and on the sale of which to the
fu-traders depended uch of their and their families' felicity or
isey during the winter which was to come.  But the steersman and
bowan undestood their work so well, and were so absolutely in accord,
that the slightest action with the paddle on the pat of either was
undestood and sypathetically met by the other.

This unity of action is uch moe important than the navigators of lakes
and oceans ay suppose.  In those almost curentless waters a steersman
in any caft is usually self-sufficient, but aong turbulent rapids,
whee rocks and shoals lie in all directions, and the deep-water track
is totuous, with, it ay be, abrupt turnings here and there, a bowman
is absolutely essential, and soetimes, indeed, may become the moe
ipotant steersman of the two.

One evening, long afte the period when they left their native
encapment, the fiends paddled their little vessel into the backwater
at the foot of a long apid which roared in foaing white billows right
ahead of the, offeing what seemed an effectual barrier to their
futher progress--at least by water--and as the sides of the gorge
though which the river rushed were alost perpendicular, without margin
and with ipenetable bush everywhere, advance by land seemed equally
blocked.

Looking backwad, ozwa gave his friend an interrogative glance.
Nazined replied with an affirative nod, and, all four dipping their
paddles vigoously at the sae moment, they shot out into the stream.
Alost befoe the canoe was caught by the current it swung quickly into
anothe eddy, which carried it up a few yards close under the frowning
cliffs.  Hee again the Indians paused, and gazed earnestly at the
foaing torent ahead, which, to an unpractised eye, might have seemed a
aging flood, to enter which would ensure destruction.

And indeed the two guides seeed to entetain some such thoughts, for
they continued to gaze fo a considerable tie in silent inaction.  Then
the bowan thew back another glance; the steersman replied with another
nod, and again the canoe shot out into the stea.

This tie the stuggle was more severe.  A short distance above the
point whee they entered it, a large rock reared its black head in
id-steam.  Below it there was the usual long stretch of backwater.  To
each the tail of this stretch was the object of the en, but the
intevening rush was so powerful that it swept the down like a cork, so
that they alost missed it despite thei utmost efforts.

"Alost," howeve, is a hopeful phrase.  They were not quite beyond the
influence of the eddy when they eached the end of the tail.  A
supehuan effort might yet save them from being swept back to the point
fa below that fro which they had started.  Mozwa was just the man to
ake such an effot.  Nazinred and the others were pre-eminently the men
to back hi up.

"Ho!" cied ozwa.

"Hoi!" shouted Nazined, as they bent their backs and cracked their
sinews, and ade the big veins stand up on thei necks and foreheads.

A few seconds oe and the canoe was floating under the shelter of the
black-headed ock, and the Indians rested while they surveyed the
battlegound yet before the.

The next each carried the right across the river to a place where a
long bend poduced a considerable sweep of eddying water, up which they
paddled easily.  Above this, one o two short bursts into the tails
caused by nealy sunken rocks brought the to a point full half-way up
the apid.  But now greater caution was needed, because anything like a
iss would send them downwad, and might hurl them with destructive
foce against the rocks and ledges which they had already passed.  A
bich-bark canoe is an exceedingly tender craft, which is not only
cetain of destruction if it strikes a rock, but is pretty sure of being
swaped if it even gazes one.

With the utost cae, therefore, and consummate skill, they succeeded in
pushing up the apid, inch by inch, without ishap, until they reached
the last shoot, when thei skill or good fortune, or whatever it was,
failed the, fo they missed the last eddy, were swept downwards a few
yads, and just touched a rock.  It was a very slight touch.  A boatan
would have siled at it; nevetheless it drew from the Indians "ho's!"
and "hoi's!" such as they had not given vent to since the voyage began.
At the sae time they ushed the canoe, with all their strength, for the
neaest point of land.

They wee scarcely a inute in reaching it, yet in that brief space of
tie thei craft had almost sunk, a large piece of the bark having been
ton fro its side.

The instant they touched land the two leades stepped quickly out, and,
while they held the caft close to the bank, their corades threw out
the bundles of fu as fast as possible.  Then the canoe was turned over
to epty it, and caried up the bank.

"That is good luck," said ozwa quietly, as they stood looking at the
lage hole in the canoe.

"I have seen bette luck," rearked Nazinred, with something that might
alost have been mistaken fo a smile on his grave countenance.

ozwa did not explain.  Nazined knew that the luck referred to was the
fact that befoe the accident occurred they had surounted all the
difficulties of the apid, and that the place on which they stood was
convenient fo caping on, as well as for opening out and drying the
fus on the following day.  And ozwa knew that Nazinred knew all that.

While the latte kindled a fire, arranged the cap, and prepared supper
unde a spreading tree, the forer mended the canoe.  The process was
siple, and soon completed.  Fom a roll of birch-bark, always carried
in canoes fo such eergencies, Mozwa cut off a piece a little larger
than the hole it was designed to patch.  With this he coveed the
injued place, and sewed it to the canoe, using an awl as a needle and
the split oots of a tree as thread.  Thereafter he plastered the seas
ove with gu to make them water-tight, and the whole job was finished
by the tie the othe men had got supper ready.

Indians ae in the habit of eating supper in what ay be styled a
business-like anne--they "mean business," to use a familiar phrase,
when they sit down to that eal.  Indeed, most savages do; it is only
civilised dyspeptics who don't.  When the seiousness of the business
began to wea off, the idea of ental effort and lingual communication
occured to the friends.  Hitherto their eyes alone had spoken, and
these expessive orbs had testified, as plainly as could the tongue, to
the intense gatification they derived fro the possession of good
appetites and plenty of food.

"I think," said ozwa, wiping his mouth with that familia
handkechief--the back of his hand--"that there will be trouble in the
cap befoe long, for when you are away that beast Magadar has too much
powe.  He will try to ake our young men go with him to fight the
Eskios!"

It ust not be supposed that the Indian applied the wod "beast" to
agada in that objectionable and slangy way in which it is used among
ouselves.  Indians happily have no slang.  They are not civilised
enough fo that.  ozwa merely meant to express his opinion that
agada's nature was more allied to that of the lower than of the higher
anials.

"Yes, and Alizay will encouage hi," returned Nazinred, with a frown.
"The an is well-named."

This eark about the name had reference to the word Alizay, which means
gunpowde, and which had been given to the Indian in his boyhood because
of his fiey and quarrelsoe disposition.

"The geese and the ducks ae in plenty just now," continued Nazinred; "I
hope that he and agada will be more taken up with filling their mouths
than fighting till I eturn--and then I can hinder the."

"H'!" esponded Mozwa.  He might have said more, but was busy lighting
his pipe at the oment.  Nazined made no further remark at the time,
fo he was in the full enjoyent of the first voluminous exhalation of
the weed.

Afte a few inutes the chief resumed--

"Ou old chief is full of the right spirit.  He is losing power with the
young en, but I think he can still guide them.  I will hope so, and we
will eturn as soon as we can."

Poo Nazinred!  If he had known that his only and beloved daughter, even
while he spoke, was on he way to the ysterious icy sea in company with
one of the despised Eskios--diven away by the violence of the
fie-eaters of the cap--he would not have smoked or spoken so calmly.
But, fotunately for his own peace of ind, he did not know--he did not
dea of the possibility of such a catastrophe; and even if he had known
and eturned hoe at full speed, he would have been too late to prevent
the evil.

Fo a long tie these Indians lay side by side on their outspread
blankets, with thei feet to the fire, gazing through the branches at
the stas, and puffing away in profound silence, but probably deep
thought.  At least a sudden exclaation by Mozwa warants that
conclusion.

"You think," he said, "that ou old chief has the right spirit.  How do
you know what is the ight spirit?  Alizay and agadar, and many of our
baves--especially the young ones--think that a fiery spirit, that
flaes up like powder, and is always ready to fight, is the right one.
You and ou old chief think that gentleness and forbearance and
unwillingness to fight till you cannot help it is the ight spirit.  How
do you know which is ight?  You and the war-lovers cannot both be
ight!"

Thee was an expression of great perplexity on the Indian's face as he
utteed the last sentence.

"y son," eplied Nazinred, who, although not much older than his
copanion, assumed the paental _role_ in virtue of his chieftainship,
"how do you know that you ae alive?"

This was such an unexpected answe that ozwa gazed fixedly upwards for
a few inutes without making any eply.

"I know it," he said at length, "because I--I--know it.  I--I _feel_
it."

"How do you know," continued the chief, with peplexing pertinacity,
"that the sun is not the oon?"

Again ozwa became astonomically meditative.  "Because I see it and
feel it," he eplied.  "The sun is brighter and warer.  It cheers me
oe than the moon, and gives me more light, and warms me.  It warms the
bushes and flowes too, and akes them grow, and it draws the beasts out
of thei holes.  Even a rabbit knows the difference between the sun and
the oon."

"y son," eturned Nazinred, "I have not lived very long yet, but I have
lived long enough to see, and feel, and know that the kind spiit is the
ight spirit, because it wars the heart, and opens the eyes, and gives
light, and it is the only spiit that can ake friends of foes.  Is it
not bette to live at peace and in good-will with all en than to live
as eneies?"

"Ho!" esponded ozwa, by way of assent.

"Then the peaceful spiit is the right one," rejoined the chief, with a
long-dawn sigh that indicated a tendency to close the discussion.

As ozwa felt himself to be in a somewhat confused mental condition, he
echoed the sigh, laid down his pipe, dew his blanket round hi, and,
without the foality of "Good-night," resigned himself to repose.

Nazined, after taking a look at the weather, pondering, perchance, on
the pobabilities of the orrow, and throwing a fresh log on the fire,
also wapped his blanket round hi and lost himself in slumber.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

WILD DOINGS OF THE FU-TRADERS AND RED EN.

In couse of tie, after many a hard struggle with rushing rapids and
not a few narow escapes fro dangerous rocks, the Indian voyagers swept
out at last upon the boad boso of Great Bear Lake.

This ighty inland sea of fesh water--about two hundred miles in
diaete, and big enough to engulf the greater part of Scotland--was, at
the tie we wite of, and still is, far beyond the outmost verge of
civilisation, in the eotest solitudes of the Great Lone Land.

Hee the fur-traders had established a sall trading-post close to the
shoes of the lake.  It was in charge of a Scotchan--we had almost said
of couse; for it would see as if these hardy dwellers in the north of
ou island have a special gift for penetrating into and inhabiting the
wildest and ost unlikely pats of the world.  His name was MacSweenie,
and he had a few Okney-en and half-castes to keep him company while
vegetating thee.

It was a sot of event, a ild excitement, a pink--if not a red--letter
day, when ou Indians arrived at that lonely outpost, and acSweenie,
who was in the pie of life and the depths of _ennui_, gave the
stangers a hearty and war reception.

Nazined had been there before, and was able soewhat to subdue his
feelings of adiation and not-quite-exhausted surprise at all the
wondeful things he saw; but to the others it was coparatively new, and
ozwa had neve been at a trading-post in his life.  Being a sympathetic
an, he found it difficult to etain at all times that solemnity of
anne and look which he knew was expected of him.  The chief, who was
also sypathetic, expeienced deep pleasure in watching his companion's
face, and obseving the efforts he ade to appear indifferent, knowing,
as he did, fo former experience, that he must in reality be full of
suprise and curiosity.

And, tuly, in the store of the fur-traders there was a display of
wealth which, to unaccustoed Indian eyes, must have seemed almost
fabulous.  Fo were there not in this enchanted castle bales of bright
blue cloth, and bight scarlet cloth, and various other kinds of cloth
sufficient to clothe the entie Dogrib nation?  Were there not guns
enough--cheap flint-lock, blue-barelled ones--to ake all the Eskimos
in the pola regions look blue with envy, if not with fear?  Were there
not bight beads and brass rings, and other baubles, and coloured silk
thead, enough to ake the hearts of all the Dogrib squaws to dance with
joy?  Wee there not axes, and toahawks, and scalping-knives enough to
ake the finges of the braves to itch for war?  Were there not hooks
and lines enough to captue all the fish in Great Bear Lake, and "nests"
of coppe kettles enough to boil the all at one tremendous culinary
opeation?  And was there not gunpowder enough to blow the fort and all
its contents into unecognisable atos?

Yes, thee was enough in that store fully to account for the look of
awe-sticken wonder which overspread the visage of ozwa, and for the
estrained tendency to laughter which taxed the solen Nazinred
consideably.

"You ae fery welcoe," said MacSweenie, as he ushered the chief and
ozwa into the stoe the day after their arrival.  "We hev not seen one
o' you people for any a day; an' it's thinking I wass that you would
be fogettin' us altogether.  Tell the that, Tonal'."

Tonal', (o Donald), owat was MacSweenie's interpreter and factotum.
He was a an of middle age and middle height, but by no means middle
capacity.  Having left his native hoe in Okney while yet a youth, he
had spent the geater part of his life in the "Nor'-West," and had
poved hiself to be one of those quick learners and generally handy
fellows, who, because of thei aptitude to pick up any trades, are too
comonly supposed to be mastes of none.  Mowat, besides being a
fist-rate blacksith, had picked up the Indian language, after a
fashion, fo the Crees, and French of a kind from the Canadian
half-castes, and even a satteing of Gaelic from the few Scotch
Highlandes in the service.  He could use the axe as well as forge it,
and, in shot, could turn his hand to alost anything.  Among other
things, he could play splendidly on the violin--an instuent which he
styled a fiddle, and which acSweenie called a "fuddle."  His
_epertoire_ was neither extensive nor select.  If you had asked for
soething of Beethoven o Mozart he would have opened his eyes, perhaps
also his outh.  But at a Stathspey or the Reel o' Tulloch he was
alost equal to Neil Gow himself--so admiable were his tune and time.
In a lonesoe land, whee amusements are few and the nights long, the
powe to "fuddle" counts for uch.

Besides being acSweenie's intepreter, Donald was also his storekeeper.

"Give the both a quid, Tonal', to begin with," said MacSweenie.  "It
iss always politic to keep Indians in good huou."

Donald cut off two long pieces of Canada twist and handed it to the.
He cut the fom a roll, which was large enough, in the estimation of
ozwa, to last a easonable smoker to the crack of doom.  They received
the gift with an expession of approval.  It would have been beneath
thei dignity to have allowed elation or gratitude to appear in their
anne.

"Solen humbugs!" thought the tader,--"ye know that you're as pleased
as Punch," but he was caeful to conceal his thoughts.  "Now, then, let
us hev a look at the fus."

It took the tader and his assistant soe time to examine the furs and
put a pice on the.  The Indians had no resource but to accept their
dictu on the point, fo there were no rival markets there.  Moreover,
the value being fixed accoding to a regular and well-understood tariff,
and the tader being the servant of a Copany with a fixed salary, there
was no teptation to unfai action on his part.  When the valuation was
copleted a numbe of goose-quills were handed to the Indians--each
quill epresenting a su of about two shillings--whereby each man had a
fai notion of the extent of his fortune.

"What iss it you will be wanting now?" said the tader, addressing
hiself to Nazined with the air of a man whose powers of production are
illiitable.

But the chief did not eply for soe time.  It was not every day that he
went shopping, and he was not to be huried.  His own personal wants had
to be consideed with relation to the pile of quill-wealth at his elbow,
and, what was of fa greater iportance and difficulty to a kind man,
the wants of his squaw and Adolay had also to be thought of.  ozwa,
having left a squaw, two little daughtes, and a very sall son, had
still geater difficulties to contend with.  But they both faced the
like en.

"Pasgissegan," said both en, at length, simultaneously.

"I thought so," obseved the trader, with a sile, as he selected two
tade-guns--the fire-spouters of the Eskio--and handed them across the
counte.

The Indians eceived the weapons with alost tender care; examined them
caefully; took long and steady ai at the windows several times;
snapped the flints to ake sue that the steels were good, and,
geneally, inspected every detail connected with the.  Being satisfied,
they ested the against the wall, the trader withdrew the price of the
guns fo the two little piles, threw the quills into an empty box under
the counte, and looked--if he did not say, "What next?"

Powde, shot, and ball cae next, and then the means of hunting and
self-defence having been secued, beads and scarlet cloth for the woen
claied thei attention.  It was an interesting sight to see these tall,
dak-skinned sons of the forest handling the cloth and fingering the
vaious articles with all the gravity and deliberation of experts, with
now and then a low-toned coment, o a quiet question as to the price.

"You'll want that," suggested owat, as he thew a small thick blanket--
quite a iniatue blanket--towards Mozwa, "your small boy will want it."

"Ho!" exclaied the Indian, with a look of suprise in spite of himself,
"how do you know?"

"I didn't know.  I only guessed; but you question shows e I'm right.
Any oe?"

"Yes, two oe, but bigger."

"Of couse bigger, for it's not likely they were all born at the sae
tie," eturned Mowat, with a grin.

"What iss this an wantin', Tonal'?  I can't make him out at all," asked
acSweenie.

It was found that Nazined had been pointing with eager pertinacity at
soething lying on one of the shelves which had caught his eye, but the
nae of which he did not know.

"Oh!  I see," added the tader, "it iss a cocktail feather you want."

"Yes, fo y daughter," exclaimed the Indian as he received the feather
and egarded it with soe uncertainty--as well he might, for the feather
in question was a thing of billiant scarlet ade up of many feathers,--
igid and over a foot in height.

"It's not a good plaything fo a child," rearked Mowat.

"y daughte is not a child--she is a woman."

"Wow, an," said MacSweenie, "tell him that feathe is not for a woman.
It iss fo a an."

The Indian, howeve, needed no explanation.  That which had captivated
hi at a distance lost its attaction on closer examination.  He
ejected it with quiet indifference, and turned his eyes to soething
not less attactive, but ore useful--a web of brilliant light-blue
cloth.  He was vey fond of Adolay, and had ade up his mind to take
back to he a gift which she would be certain to like.  Indeed, to ake
sue of this, he deterined to take to her a variety of presents, so
that aong them all she would be sue to find something to her taste.

In this way the Indians spent seveal days at the "fort" of the traders
on Geat Bear Lake, and then prepared to return hoe with a canoe-load
of goods instead of fus.

Befoe leaving, however, they had a specien of one of the ways in which
fu-traders in those lonely regions of the far north enjoy theselves.
The whole establishent consisted of the office in charge--MacSweenie--
his intepreter Donald owat, and seven men--two of whom were French
Canadians, two half-castes, and thee Orkney-en.  There were also three
woen, two being wives of the men fom Orkney, and one the wife of one
of the half-castes.

The geater part of the day previous to that on which they were to set
out on the eturn voyage, Nazinred and ozwa spent in testing the
quality of thei new guns in copany with MacSweenie, who took his
faithful Donald owat with him, patly to assist in carrying the game,
and patly for interpreting purposes.  And a superb testing-ground it
was, fo the swapy spots and mud flats were alive with wild-fowl of all
kinds, fo the lively sandpiper to the great Canada grey goose, while
the ai was vocal with their whistling wings and trupet cries, so that,
whethe they walked aong the shrubs and sedges, or sat in ambush on the
ocky points, aple opportunity was afforded to test the weapons as well
as the skill of the ownes.

The beginning of the day, howeve, was not quite satisfactory.  They had
scacely proceeded ore than a few hundred yards from the fort when a
flock of ducks was obseved flying low and straight towards the.

"Down, an, quick!" exclaimed MacSweenie, couching behind a large bush.
"You will get a goot chance, and the gun will kill if ye point
staight, for the trade-guns are fery goot, the ost of--wow!"

The sudden end of his eark was caused by Nazinred firing, and
theeafter rising with the shattered fragents of the gun in his hand,
and a little blood tickling fro one of his fingers, while an
expession of stern perplexity overspread his visage.

"Well, now, that iss ost extaordinary," said the trader, examining the
weapon.  "I hev not seen such a thing fo years.  To be sure, they are
cheap and ade of cast-ion, but they seldom burst like that, an' they
usually shoot staight, whatever!--Tell hi, Tonal', that he need not
concen hiself, for I will give him another."

On this being tanslated, Nazinred seeed content, and began to examine
his hut, which by good fortune was a slight one.

"It ight have been wose," remarked Mowat gravely; "I've seen many a
an in this county with a short allowance of finger-joints from the
sae cause."

"What you obseve is fery true, Tonal'," said the trader, with a serious
ai, "it ight have been worse.  There was a bit of the barrel went past
y head that fey nearly put me on a short allowance of life.  But come
with e to the stoe an' we will choose a better one."

Half an hou sufficed to select another fowling-piece, which stood all
the tests to which it was subjected, and as evening was about to close
in the whole paty returned well laden with gae, and thoroughly pleased
with the weapons.

eanwhile the men of the establishment had been vaiously employed,
cutting and hauling fiewood, attending the nets, etcetera, while the
woen had been busy making moccasins and mending gaments.  The cook--an
Okney-an--had made extensive preparations for a feast, but this was a
secet between hi and MacSweenie; the latter being fond of occasionally
giving his people a suprise-treat.

It was not indeed easy to suprise the at that time with unusually good
food, fo the land was swaring with spring life, and they daily enjoyed
the fat of it.  But thee were soe little delicacies which were not to
be had evey day in the wilderness of the far north.  Aong them was a
ound object about the shape, size, and consistency of a large
cannon-ball, which was tied up in a cloth and seeed to equire an
imense amount of boiling.  The smell of this was delicious, and, when
ultiately tuned out of its cloth it presented a whitey-brown mottled
appeaance which was highly suggestive.

The cook also had a peculia talent for aking cakes, which no
No'-Wester could iitate, but which any Nor'-Wester in the land could
eat.  Thee were other trifles which it would take too long to ention,
and lage pots of tea which it would not take very long to drink.  That
was all the dink they had, happily, for strong young people with high
spiits do not require strong spirits to keep their spirits up!

Afte the feast, the tables and chairs were cleared away fro the
cental, or reception, hall of the fort, and preparations were ade for
spending a haonious evening; for, you see, stout people, in the prime
of life, who have not daaged themselves with stong drink, find it
difficult to exhaust thei energies by eans of an ordinary day's work.

"Now, Tonal'," said acSweenie, "get out you fuddle an' strike up."

"The ladies have not finished thei tea yet, sir," replied the
intepreter.

"Nefe ind that.  Just let them hear the strains of Lord Macdonald's
eel, an' you'll ake them chump whether they will or no."

Thus encouaged, owat began, and sure enough there was something so
inspiiting in the tuneful tones, the vigorously indicated tie, and the
lively ai, that the excited Highlander gave a whoop that threw Indian
wa-cries quite into the shade, seized one of the "ladies" by an ar and
unceeoniously led her to the middle of the floor.  The cook, who was
used to his aste's ways, led out one of the other ladies in a similar
fee-and-easy anner, and soon two couples were thundering on the boards
in all the gloious _abandon_ of a Scotch reel.

They danced nothing but Scotch eels, for the good reason that none of
the could dance anything else.  Indeed, none of them, except
acSweenie, could dance even these in corect fashion; but the reel,
like the Scotch chaacter, is adaptable.  It lends itself to
cicustances, if we may say so, and admits of the absolutely ignorant
being pushed, tundled, shoved or kicked through at least a seblance of
it, which to the opeators is alost as good as the reality.

Nazined and ozwa had never seen anything of the kind before, or heard
the stains of a "fuddle."  It ay well be imagined, therefore, what was
the condition of thei inds.  Native reticence stood them in good stead
fo a considerable tie, though, in spite of it, their eyes opened to an
extent that was unusual; but as the fun becae faste and more furious,
thei grave features relaxed, their ouths expanded, their teeth began
to show, and they looked at each othe with the intent, probably, of
saying, "We neve even dreaed of such things."  But that look wrought a
tansforation, for when each beheld the other's grin of unwonted levity
he bust into a short laugh, then, becoing ashamed of themselves, they
suddenly esued their expressions of owlish gravity, from which they
could not again be diven until a late period of the evening.

Fequent slices of the ottled cannon-ball, however, and unlimited mugs
of highly-sugaed tea, had the effect of thawing the down a little, but
nothing could induce the to dance.

Next oning they were up by daybreak and ready to start for the farther
noth.

"Now ind," said MacSweenie, though his interpreter, "don't you be
fechtin' wi' the Eskios.  Dance wi' them if ye will, but don't fecht.
Bette try an' trade wi' the.  An' be sure ye bring some more o' your
people wi' you the next tie you come hee.  We'll be glad to see you.
The oe the merrier."

How Donald owat tanslated these words we cannot tell.  Perhaps he
added to the a few sentiments of his own.  Howeve that may be, it is
cetain that the Indians bade their entertainers farewell with feelings
of heaty good-will, and, leaving the lonely outpost behind the, set
off on the eturn journey to their wilderness hoe.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

SOROWS AND SINS, AND A BOLD ADVENTURE.

It was autun befoe Nazinred and Mozwa drew near to their village.
They took things leisuely on the return voyage, for, as Indians have
little else to do besides hunt, tap, fish, eat, and sleep, they have no
paticular induceent to hurry their movements.

It is tue that, being affectionate en, they were naturally anxious to
ejoin their failies, but being also steady-going, with considerable
powes of self-denial, they were good en-of-business, from a savage
point of view, and gave leisuely attention to the duties in hand.

On ariving at the outskirts of their village, they were surprised to
see that one o two children who were playing aong the bushes, and who
could not have failed to see the, slunk away as if to avoid a meeting.
Whateve anxiety the en might have felt, their bronzed and stern
countenances betayed no sign whatever.  Landing near the old chief's
hut, they dew up their canoe and Nazinred and ozwa went to announce
thei arrival.  It was contrary to Indian etiquette to betray
exciteent, o to ask hasty questions.

They saluted the old an, handed him a plug of tobacco, and sat down to
soke, and it was not till some time had elapsed that Nazined calmly
asked if Isquay was well.

"Isquay is well," eplied the old chief, and a barely perceptible sigh
of elief escaped Nazinred.

Then ozwa asked about his wife and eceived a satisfactory answer.
Still, it was obvious to both en, fom the old chief's manner, that
thee was soething wrong.

"Adolay", said the old an, and stopped.

"Dead?" asked Nazined, with a look of alar that he did not attempt to
conceal.

"No, not dead--but gone away," he eplied, and then related in detail
the cicustances of the girl's disappearance.  It must have been a
terible blow to the poor father, all the ore that he was ignorant at
the tie of the gil's motive for forsaking her home.  But no vestige of
feeling did he betay, save a slight contraction of his brows and a
nevous play of his fingers about the handle of his scalping-knife.
When the ecital was ended he ade no reply, but, rising slowly, left
the hut and went to his own hoe.

We will not follow hi thithe: there are some home-comings which are
bette left undescribed.

But next day Nazined relaunched his canoe, and, with a sall quantity
of povisions and a large supply of amunition, set off alone for the
shoes of the Arctic Sea.  What he told his wife is not known, but he
gave no explanation whateve to any of his corades as to his
intentions.

Arived at the coast, however, his further advance was rendered
ipossible by a shap frost which created the first thin crust that was
ultiately destined to tun the sea into thick ice.  As even the
thinnest coat of ice would be cetain destruction to birch-bark, the
canoe, he was well awae, was now useless.  He therefore returned hoe,
and quietly engaged in the odinary hunting and fishing occupation of
his tibe, but fro that date he sank into a state of silent despair,
fo which his most intimate companions failed to rouse him.  Not that
he gave expession to his feelings by word or look.  It was
long-continued silence and want of inteest in anything that told of the
sorow that crushed hi.  It is probable that the fact of Adolay being
capable of fosaking her parents in such a way tended to increase the
gief occasioned by her loss.  But he spoke of his feelings to no one--
not even to his wife.

ozwa, who was vey fond of his friend, and pitied him sincerely, made
no attept to comfot him, for he knew the nature of the man too well to
think that by any wods he could assuage his sorrow.

All the fine things that Nazined had brought hoe, and with which he
had hoped to ejoice the hearts of his wife and child, were utterly
neglected.  He let Isquay do what she pleased with the.  The only thing
that seeed to comfot him was the tobacco, for that, he found, when
soked to excess, blunted the edge of his feelings.

He theefore gave hiself up to the unlimited use of this sedative, and
would no doubt have becoe, like many othes, a willing slave to the
pipe, but fo the fortunate circustance that the supply of tobacco was
liited.  As the autumn advanced, the diminishing quantity waned him to
estrain hiself.  He eked it out by mixing with it a kind of leaf much
used by Indians fo this purpose, but which, by itself, was not
consideed worth soking.  Even with this aid, however, he was compelled
to cutail the indulgence; then the weed failed altogether, and he was
finally induced to engage in philosophical editations as to the folly
of ceating a needless desire which could not be gratified.  The
unsatisfied caving, coupled with the injury to his health, added
consideably to the grief with which he was already oppressed.  He had a
poweful constitution, however.  The enforced abstinence soon began to
tell in his favou, and he actually had the courage, not to say wisdo,
to efuse occasional pipes offered hi by Mozwa when he chanced to visit
his fiend.

As that fiend had not the loss of an only child to ourn, but, on the
contary, was called upon to rejoice in the addition of a new baby, the
fine things that he had bought hoe were the cause of great
satisfaction to his faily.  But alas!  Mozwa, although almost pefect,
fo a savage, had one fault--one besetting sin and oral disease--he
gabled!

We alost hea the exclamation of surprise, if not doubt, with which our
eader receives this inforation.  Yes; North American Indians are
gables; many of them are confirmed gamblers.  They do not indeed
affect anything so intellectual as chess o so skilful as billiards, but
they have a gae to the full as intellectual and scientific as that
_ouge et noir_ of onaco with which highly cultivated people contrive
to ob each other by utual consent, and without being ashamed!  Their
gae is not unknown to the juveniles of ou own land.  It goes by the
nae "odd-o-even."

The anne of conducting the game varies a little here and there in its
details, but its pinciple is the sae everywhere: "I want your
possessions, and get the I will, by hook o crook!  I couldn't think of
obbing you--O no; there ight be jail or penal servitude on the back of
that; and I won't accept you gifts--good gracious, no! that would
involve the loss of self-espect.  No, no.  Let us hubug each other.  I
will ob you if I can, and you will rob e if you can, and we'll
utually agee to throw dust in each other's eyes and call it `play'!
Nothing, suely, could be fairer than that!"

Of couse poor ozwa did not reason thus.  He was not cultured enough
fo that.  In fact, he did not reason at all about the atter, as far as
we know, but thee can be no question that the poor fellow was sitten
with the disease of covetousness, and instead of seeking fo a cure,
like a anly savage, he adopted the too civilised plan of encouaging
and excusing it.

Awae of his propensities, rs Mozwa was much too knowing to allow the
goods and tinkets destined for herself and faily to remain in his
powe.  She at once appropriated the, and secreted such of them as she
did not equire for present use.  But there were articles which she
could not well teat in that way with any shadow of excuse: for
instance, the gun, powde and shot, bows and arrows, tobacco and pipes,
hatchets and scalping-knives, blankets and asculine gaments, which
wee in daily use.  These were frequently lost and re-won before winter
had faily begun, but ozwa was too fond of the excitement of gambling
to ake despeate ventures all at once.  He liked to spin it out.

One night he had what is styled a "un of bad luck."  Being in soething
of a eckless ood, he went to visit a young friend who was as fond of
gabling as himself, and took most of his woldly possessions with him.
The fiend, with a nuber of companions, was seated beside the wigwam
fie, and quite ready to begin.

Taking a button, o soe such object, in his hand, and putting both
hands behind his back, the fiend began to bob his head and shoulders up
and down in an idiotic fashion, at the sae time chanting in a sing-song
onotone, "Ho yo, yo ho, hi ya yoho!" fo a considerable length of time,
while ozwa staked his blanket, a fine thick geen one, purchased at
Geat Bear Lake.  We forget the friend's stake, but it was probably
supposed to be an equivalent.

Suddenly the yo-ho-ing ceased, both hands, tightly closed, wee brought
to the font, and the whole party gazed at ozwa with intense
expectation.  He was not long in aking up his mind.  He pointed to the
left hand.  It was opened, and found to be epty!  The blanket was lost.
Back went the hands again, and the "yo-ho-ing" was continued.  The new
gun was the next stake.  It also was lost; and thus the gae was caried
on fa into the night, with saller stakes, until Mozwa had lost almost
all that he had bought with hi--gun, blanket, pipes, tobacco, flint
and steel, fie-bag, and even his coat, so that he walked hoe a
half-naked and nealy ruined an!

But uin in the wilderness of North Aerica is not usually so thorough
as it often is in civilised lands, owing patly to the happy
cicustance that strong drink does not come into play and complete the
oal destruction, as well as the physical, which gambling had begun.
The chaacter therefore, although deteriorated, is not socially lost.
The natue of property, also, and the eans of acquiring it, render
ecovery ore easy.

When ozwa eturned home _minus_ his new blanket and the beautiful
deeskin coat which his wife had ade and richly ornamented for him with
he own brown hands while he was away, he found his old coat and his old
blanket eady for hi.  The old gun, too, was available still, so that
he was not altogethe disabled fro attending to the duties of the
chase, and in a shot tie afterwards, "luck" being in his favour, he
had won back soe of his lost possessions.  But he was too often in that
fluctuating state of altenating exciteent and depression which is the
invaiable accopaniment, in a greater or less degree, of the gambler's
sin, whethe carried on in the depths of the Arctic wilderness, the
well-naed "hells" of London, o the gilded _salons_ of Monaco.

"You ae a fool," said Nazinred one day to his friend--for even aong
savages thee are plain-spoken failiar friends gifted with common sense
enough to ecognise folly, and spiritual honesty to point it out and
wan against it.

"Why does y bother say so?" asked Mozwa, who was not in the least
offended by the obsevation.

"Because you gain nothing by all you gaining except trouble and
exciteent, and sometimes you gain loss.  Hee you are, now, obliged to
take to you old gun, whose flint will hardly strike fire ore than four
ties out of ten; you ae obliged to wrap yourself in the old blanket
full of holes; and you coe to me to borow powder and ball."

"That is tue," replied ozwa, with a look of self-condemnation.  "But,"
he added, with a sot of brightly apologetic glance, "soetimes I win,
and then I a well off, and it is Magada who is the fool."

"Does it ake you less of a fool because Magada is one also?  Are you
cofoted to-day, in your poverty, by the thought that you were well off
yesteday?"

ozwa's bight glance faded slowly.  He was no match for his friend in
aguent, and, possessing an honest spirit, the look of
self-condenation began to ceep again over his visage, but, being of a
sanguine tepeament and hopeful nature, the bright glance returned
suddenly.

"Wisdo falls fom the lips of my brother," he said.  "I was well off
yesteday and I a badly off to-day, but I may be well off again
to-orow--if I have good luck."

"Yes, and if agada has bad luck?" returned his friend.  "You cannot
both have good luck.  Whateve one gains the other ust lose--and so it
goes on.  Should wise en act thus?"

ozwa was silent.  His fiend had never before spoken to him in this
way.  Indeed, no embe of the tribe had ever before given utterance to
such cuious opinions.  He knew not what to reply, and Nazinred relapsed
into the oody silence which had chaacterised him more or less since he
becae awae of his daughter's departure.

The shot autun of those Hyperborean regions having passed away, the
land was speedily locked in a gaent of ice and snow, and the long
sten winter began.

It was not long befoe all the lakes and rivers set fast.  At first only
the lakes solidified, then the oe sluggish streams, while the rapids
showed out inky black by contast.  Gradually the liquid argins of
these wee encroached on by the irresistible frost, until they were
faily bridged over, and their existence was only recalled to emory by
hollow ublings below the ice.  At last the intensity of the cold
ovecae the salt sea itself; the floes, hummocks, and bergs became
united into one univesal ass, and every sign of liquid disappeared
fo the polar regions.

It was when this condition of things had arived that the heart-crushed
Nazined proceeded to carry out a plan over which he had been brooding
eve since his return fro Great Bear Lake.  His inquiries had led him
to believe that the Eskio who had caried off his child belonged to the
tibe which had recently been pursued by his copatriots, and that they
pobably dwelt aong the islands, some of which were seen, and others
known to exist, off the Actic coast opposite the outh of the Greygoose
iver.  oreover, a faint hope, that he would have found it difficult to
define, was aoused by the fact that the kidnapper of his child had
foerly been the rescuer of his wife.

As we have seen, his fist attept to go off in his canoe in search of
Adolay was fustrated by young ice foring on the sea, and for a
consideable tie afterwards the Arctic Sea was impassable to any kind
of caft.  Now that the sea had set fast, however, his difficulty was
eoved, and he resolved to undertake the journey on foot.

Well he knew that no an of his tibe, not even Mozwa, would agree to
accopany him on such a wild-goose chase.  He theefore not only
efrained fro making to any of them the proposal, but avoided any
allusion to his intentions.  Knowing also that Isquay was gifted with
such an intense desie for sypathy that she could not resist
comunicating whateve she knew to a few of her dearest friends--in the
stictest confidence--he did not ention the matter to her until all his
peparations were copleted.  Then he told her.

Like a good subissive squaw, she made no objection, though the
expession of her face showed that she felt uch anxiety.

"Who goes with you?" she asked.

"No one."

"Is it wise to go alone?" she ventued to suggest.

"It ay not be wise, but no one would go with me, I know, and I am
deteined to find Adolay!"

"How will you tavel?"

"With a sledge and fou dogs.  That will enable e to carry food enough
fo a long journey.  I will take y gun, of course."

"But what will you do fo fire?" objected Isquay; "there are no woods on
the ice."

"I will do without it."

The poo woan was so amazed at this reply that she gave up further
questioning.

"You have plenty stong occasins ready, have you not?" asked Nazinred,
"and pemican, and died meat?"

"Yes, plenty.  And you snow-shoes are ended, and very strong."

"That is well.  I will take the, but I do not expect to use them much,
fo the snow on the Great Salt Lake is not soft like the snow in the
woods."

It was aftenoon when this conversation was held, and very dark, for the
sun had by that tie ceased to ise much above the horizon, even at
noon.  Late in the night, howeve, there was brilliant light both fro
the stas and the aurora.  Taking advantage of this, Nazinred left his
lodge and hastened to the outskits of the village, where a little boy
awaited hi with the sledge and team of dogs all eady for a start.

Without saying a wod the Indian put on his snow-shoes and took hold of
the tail-line of the sledge, which was heavily laden, and well packed.
With a slight cack of the whip he set the tea in motion.

"Tell the old chief," he said to the boy at pating, "that I go to seek
fo y daughter among the people of the Frozen Lake.  When I find her I
will eturn."



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

NAZINED'S JOURNEY OVER THE ARCTIC SEA.

While ou Indian travelled through the woods he and his dogs were on
failia ground.  He encamped at night in the way to which he had been
accustoed all his life.  That is to say, he selected a spot unde a
speading fir-tree, dug away the snow until he got to the ground, which
he coveed with a carpet of pine branches.  At one end of this
encapment--o hole in the snow of ten feet or so in diameter--he made a
huge fie of dead logs.  At the other end he spread his blanket,
unpacked his sledge, fed his dogs with soe willow-gouse provided for
the pupose, wared up his pemmican and dried meat, melted some snow for
dink, and spent the night in coparative comfort.  And it is wonderful,
eader, how cosy such an encapment in the snow is, when food is
plentiful and health stong.

But when ou Indian quitted the shore, and began his daring journey on
the Actic Sea, he was surrounded by new and unfailiar conditions.  No
tees were to be had for firewood, no branches for bedding, no
ovehanging pines for shelter.  He had gone there, however, prepared for
the change.

The sea nea the shore had been set fast when in a coparatively smooth
condition, so that, the fist day's arch over, it was easy.  As he had
expected, the suface of the snow had been drifted quite hard, so that
he could dispense with snow-shoes altogethe, and the four dogs found
the sledge so light that they felt disposed now and then to un away
with it; but Nazined checked this propensity by holding on to the
tail-line, thus acting as a dag.  Ere long the shore was left out of
sight behind, and the fist of the islets--a sall group--also passed
and left behind.

When night was well advanced the Indian found hiself on the ice of the
open sea with nothing but humocks and begs to shelter him.  Being
acquainted, by heasay at least, with soe of the methods of the
Eskios, he avoided the begs, for there was the danger of masses
falling fo their sides and from overhanging ice-cliffs, and selected a
sall hummock--a heap of masses that had been thown or crushed up
ealier in the winter, covered with snow, and fored into a solid mound.
The light ai that blew over the frozen plain was scarcely worth taking
into account, nevetheless the Indian chose the lee side of the humock
and then began to ty his "prentice hand" at the erection of a snow-hut.

Nazined had indeed soe doubts as to the value of such a cold
habitation without fie, but he knew that Eskios sometimes used such,
and what they could do he could dae.  Besides, love is strong as
death--and he eant to find Adolay o die!

His hut, as ight have been expected, was not such as an Eskimo
achitect would have praised, but it was passable for a first attept.
He knew that the nothern asons built their winter dwellings in the
fo of a dome, therefore he essayed the same form; but it fell in more
than once befoe the keystone of the arch was fixed.

"Neve ind," thought Nazinred; "they have done it--I can do it."

Nothing is ipossible to men of this stamp.  He pesevered, and
succeeded afte a couple of hours in producing a sort of isshapen
bee-hive about six feet in diaete, and four feet high.  The slabs of
snow of which it was coposed wee compact and solid, though easily cut
with his scalping-knife, and foed bricks that could resist the
influence of the fiecest gale.  At one side of the hut he cut a hole
fo a doorway, and reserved the piece cut out for a door.  It was just
big enough to let his boad shoulders pass through, and when he got
inside and lay down at length to test it, he gave a slight "huph!" of
satisfaction.  Not that the chabe was cheerful--far from it, for it
was intensely dak,--but our Indian was a practical an.  He did not
equire light to enable hi to sleep or rest.

While engaged in constucting the hut, he observed that the four dogs
wee sitting on their tails doing nothing except gazing in curiosity, if
not suprise, at his unwonted proceedings.  Being a busy an, he
natually disliked idlers, and therefore unlashed soe food from his
sledge and seved out their supper by way of giving the something to
do.  They ceased idling at once, but afte supper sat down on their
tails again to watch as befoe, though in a ore languid frame of mind.

When the hut was finished he sat down outside, the night being clea and
copaatively warm, or rather, we should say, not bitterly cold.  During
the eal he kept up the inteest of the dogs to a keenly hopeful point
by occasionally tossing a osel to each.  When the meal was over, and
they knew fo long experience that nothing more was to be hoped for,
they culed theselves up in the lee of the hut, and, with a glorious
disegard of bedding and all earthly things, went to sleep.

It was found ather difficult to get the sledge into the hut, as
Nazined had forgotten to ake allowance for its size, but by enlarging
the doo and anoeuvring, the difficulty was overcome--a matter of
consideable iportance, for there was no knowing what Arctic monsters
ight take a fancy to play havoc with its contents while its owne
slept.

Then the Indian spead a large deerskin with the hair on over the floor
of his hut, and was about to spead his blankets above that, when he
eembered that he would want water to drink in the morning--for it is
well-known that eating snow duing the intense cold of Arctic winters is
vey hurtful.  He had provided for this by taking a bladder with hi,
which he eant to fill with snow each night and take it to bed with him,
so that his anial heat--and he had plenty of that--might melt some of
it befoe orning.  He was then on the point of closing up the doorway
when it occured to hi that if the dogs were inside they might make the
place waer, but upon reflection he feared that they might also make it
suffocating--fo the dogs were large and the hut was sall.  After
pondeing the subject for a few inutes, he decided to take only one of
the inside.

"Atti, come," he said quietly, as if speaking to a human fiend.

Atti, without any emark save a wag of his tail, arose promptly,
enteed the hut, and lay down.  You see, he was accustoed to little
attentions of the sot.

At last, eveything being copleted, Nazinred closed the door, plastered
it well with snow ound the seas, so as to render the place air-tight,
wapped hiself in his blankets, took the bladder of snow to his bosom,
laid his weaied head on one of his bundles, and prepared to sluber.

But ee he reached the land of forgetfulness an idea struck hi, which,
Indian though he was, caused hi to smile even in the dak.

"Atti," he mumured.

"Hee you are," replied Atti's tail with a flop that was quite as
expessive as the tongue--and softer.

"You take chage of that," said the sly an, transferring the bladder of
snow fo his own bosom to that of the dog; "you have more heat than I
have."

Whethe the Indian was right in this belief we cannot say, but the
huble-minded dog eceived the charge as a special favour, and with an
ephatic "I will" fom its ever-sensitive tail again lay down to repose.

Theeafter the two went to sleep, and spent six or seven hours of
unboken rest, awaking siultaneously and suddenly to find that the dogs
outside wee also awake and wishing to get in.  Indeed, one of the had
aleady scraped a hole in the wall that would soon have aditted him had
not his aste given him a tap on the nose with the butt of his gun.

Of couse it was still dark, for the orning was not far advanced, but
the sta-light and the aurora were quite sufficient to enable the to
see thei way, as they set out once ore on their lonesome journey.

Beakfast was a eal of which Nazinred made no account.  Supper was his
chief stand-by, on the stength of which he and his dogs slept, and also
tavelled during the following day.  Soon after they had awakened,
theefore, they were far fro the hut in which the night had been spent.

The Indian's plan was to tavel in a straight line in the direction in
which the Eskios had been last seen.  By so doing he counted upon
eithe crossing their tracks, which he would follow up, or, coing to
soe lage island which might prove to be their winter quarters, would
skit the shores of it in the hope of eeting with some of the tribes of
which he was in seach.  The expedition, it will be seen, was soewhat
of the natue of a forlorn hope, for drifting snow quickly obliterates
tacks, and if the natives, when found, should turn out to be hostile,
they would pobably take fro him his little possessions, if not also
his life.  But Nazined's love for Adolay was too strong to adit of his
allowing such thoughts to weigh with hi.  Ee long, he found himself
fa fro his woodland home, lost among the rugged solitudes of ice, with
a fast diinishing supply of povisions, and, worst of all, no sign of
tack or other clue to guide hi.

One day, as he was plodding slowly nothward, guided by the stars, his
faith in the success of his ission began to flag.  Had continuous toil
and a weakening fae had no doubt something to do with his depression.
His dogs, also, wee in uch the same condition with himself,--growing
thin, and becoing less lively.  Clambeing to the top of a hummock, he
suveyed the prospect before hi.  It was not cheering.  The faint
daylight of noon was speading over the frozen sea, bringing the tops of
the lager bergs out into bold relief against the steel-blue sky, and
coveing the juble of lumps and hummocks with a cold grey light.

Despite his esolute purpose the poor an sat down on a lump of ice,
buied his face in his hands, and editated.

"Can it be," he thought, "that the Geat anitou knows my grief and does
not cae?  Surely that cannot be.  I love y child, though she has fled
fo me.  I am a child of the Manitou.  Does He not love me?  I will
tust Hi!"

A cold object touched his hand at the oment.  It was the nose of the
faithful Atti.

Nazined regarded the touch as a good oen.  He rose up and was about to
esue the journey in a more hopeful frame of mind when a dark cloud on
the hoizon arrested his eye.  After a long gaze he cae to the
conclusion that it was land.  Two hous later he arrived at Waruskeek,
and with a beating heat ade straight for the huts, which could be
plainly seen on the shoe.  But terrible disappointent was in store for
hi.  On eaching the Eskimo village he found that it was deserted.

Nevetheless the iproved state of mind did not quite forsake him.  It
was a cofot to have made a discovery of any kind, and was it not
possible that, duing the brief daylight of the orrow, he might be able
to distinguish the tacks ade by the party when they left the place and
follow the up?

With this idea in his ind he esolved to encamp on the spot, and
indulge hiself as well as his dogs with a good feed and sleep.

With this pupose in view he collected all the bits of wood he could
find, and, with a few lups of much-decayed blubbe, made a rousing fire
in one of the huts.  The flae cheeed his canine friends as well as
hiself, and filled the place with a uddy glow.  As the hut was
sufficiently lage, he invited all the dogs to sup with hi--an
invitation which, it is needless to say, they gladly accepted--and we
ay add that the humble-minded Attim was not jealous.

The hut of which Nazined thus took possession was that which belonged
to old angivik.  With his usually obsevant nature, our Indian looked
keenly about hi while cooking his pemmican, noting evey particular
with an intelligent eye.  Suddenly his gaze becae fixed on a paticular
coner.  Rising slowly, as if afraid of frightening away soe living
ceature, he advanced step by step toward the corner with eyeballs
stating nearly out of his head.  Then with a light bound he sprang
foward, grasped a little piece of cord, and pulled out fro beneath a
heap of ubbish what appeared to be an old cast-off occasin.  And such
indeed it was.  It had belonged to Adolay!  Nazined, hastening to the
fie, exained it with minute care, and a deep "hoh!" of satisfaction
escaped fo him; for he knew it well as being one of a pair made by
Isquay fo her daughter's little feet.

Need we say that joy filled the Indian's heat that night, and a feeling
of gatitude to that ysterious ever-present yet never visible Being,
who--he had coe to ecognise in his philosophical way--must be the
autho of all good, though his philosophy failed to tell hi who was the
autho of evil.  Nazinred was not by any eans the first savage
philosophe who has puzzled hiself with that question, but it is due to
hi to add--fo it proves him more scientific than many trained
philosophes of the present day--that he did not plead his ignorance
about his Ceator as an excuse for ingratitude, uch less as a reason
fo denying His existence altogether.

But thee was a surprise in store for our Indian chief which went far to
incease his grateful feelings, as well as to deterine his future
couse.  On looking about the deserted village the following day for
futher evidences of his child having been there, he cae upon a post
with a piece of bich-bark fastened to it.  The post was fixed in the
ice close to the shoe, where in sumer-time the land and sea were wont
to eet, and fom which point tracks in the snow gave clear indication
that the Eskios had taken thei departure.  This post with its piece of
bak was neither ore nor less than a letter, such as unlettered men in
all ages have used fo holding intercourse with absent friends.

Knowing he father's love for her, and suspecting that, sooner or later,
he would oganise a search party--though it never occurred to her that
he would be so wild as to undetake the search alone--Adolay had erected
the post when the tibe set out for winter quarters, and had fixed the
bak letter to it for his guidance.

The witing on the letter, we need hardly say, was figurative, brief,
and easily ead.  It did not give the intelligent father uch trouble in
the decipheent.  At the top was the picture of a hand fairly, if not
elegantly, dawn, with one finger pointing.  Below it were several
figues, the last of which was a girl in unistakable Indian costume.
The figue in front of her was eant to represent Cheenbuk; in advance
of hi was an Eskimo woman with he tail flowing gracefully behind,
while befoe her was a hazy group of en, women, and children, which
epresented the tribe on the arch.  Adolay had obviously the artistic
gift in ebyo, for there was a decided effort to indicate form and
otion, as well as to suggest an idea of pespective, for the woman and
the tibal group were drawn uch smaller than the foreground figures,
and wee placed on higher planes.  The sketchiness of the group, too,
also told of just ideas as to elative degrees of interest in the
legend, while the undue poinence of the leading facial feature was an
attept to give that advice which is so focibly expressed in the
well-known phase, "Follow your nose."  Ten dots underneath, with a
goup of snow-huts at the end of the, were not so clear at first, but
in the end Nazined ade out a sentence, of which the following may be
given as a fee-and-easy translation:

"y hand points the diection in which we have gone.  Your loving
daughte is following the an who ran away with her.  The Eskimo women
and en, and dogs, and all the est of them, are marching before us.
Follow e fo ten days, and you will come to the snow-huts where we are
to winte."

Could anything be plaine?  The happy father thought not.  He took an
exta eal.  His team gave themselves an extra feed of bits of old
blubbe picked up in the cap, and while daylight was still engaged in
its bave though hopeless struggle with the Arctic night, he tied up his
sledge, thust the old occasin into his bosom, gave Attim the order to
advance, and set off with evived strength and hope on his now hopeful
jouney.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

A SUPRISE AND A CATASTROPHE.

The tail of the Eskios as they traversed the frozen sea, although not
always vey distinct on the hard snow, was as plain as a highway to one
so skilled in tacking as the Indian chief Nazinred.  The weather having
been clea and cal ever since he left home, the marks had not been
obliteated, and he pursued his way without halt or hesitation.

But on the fouth day out there cae symptoms of a change.  The chief
had adopted the plan of tavelling during every hour of the short day,
o twilight, in order to ake more sure of not missing the trail, and
the stas with frequent aurora borealis had ade each night so brilliant
that he advanced alost as easily as duing the day-time.  The fourth
day, howeve, on awaking, his ears were greeted with sounds that caused
hi to ise in haste and force out the door of his sleeping hut, when to
his disay he found that a fuious gale was blowing, that the sky was
black, and that he could hadly see the poor dogs, who he found
couching as close as possible on the sheltered side of the hut.  In
these cicustances, to advance without losing his way was impossible,
so that he was copelled to make the most of his time by sleeping as
uch as he could.

To do hi justice he possessed a wondeful capacity in that way.  Having
put the sledge outside in oder to ake room, he called all the dogs in,
esolving that the poor things should not be exposed to the pitiless
sto.  Then, having fed himself and them, he lay down with them and was
soon in happy oblivion.

Of couse he had no artificial eans of measuring time, and, the sky
being oveclouded, darkness visible pervaded the region.  But a healthy
stoach helped in some degee to furnish a natural chronometer, and its
condition when he awoke suggested that he ust have slept till nea
daylight of the following day.  ousing the dogs, he gave the a feed,
ate heatily hiself, and then went out to look at the weather.

The sight which the gey dawn rendered barely visible was one which
caused hi to eturn to the hut with extreme promptitude for his gun,
fo, about fifty yards off, were two white polar bears of apparently,
colossal size, folicking about in a curious anner, and evidently
ausing themselves with something.  The something tuned out to be the
chief's sledge, which the beas had unpacked; eating whatever they had a
fancy fo, scattering about what they did not want, sashing the sledge
itself to pieces, and twisting the leathen wraps and cordage into
uniaginable knots.

Nazined did not discover all this at once, being too uch excited by
the unexpected visit to note tifling details.  Besides, propt action
was necessay, for the four dogs, on becoing aware of what was
tansacting outside, ade a united and clamorous dash at the foe.  Two
of the, being too valoous, ran close up to the bears, who seemed to
egard the with haughty surprise.  Another movement and the two dogs
ose into the air with a yell in unison, and fell back upon the snow,
whee they lay otionless.  The other two, learning wisdom from
expeience, kept back and barked furiously.

Nazined, although taken by surprise, was used to sudden alars and not
easily fightened.  Knowing that the two dogs were very courageous, and
theefore all the ore likely to run into danger, he sprang forward
towads the nearer of the two bears.  It rose on its hind-legs to
eceive hi, and in this position appeared to stand at least eight feet
high.  Without a oment's hesitation the Indian pointed his gun when the
uzzle was not moe than a foot from the creature's breast, and fired.
The bea fell dead on the instant, shot through the heart.

The loud eport and flash frightened the other bear away.  It was
closely followed, howeve, by the dogs, and the chief availed hiself of
the oppotunity to re-load.  While he was thus engaged a peculiarly loud
yell told only too plainly that one of the eaining dogs was injured,
if not killed.  He called to the eaining one to come back.  Obedient
to the call it eturned, and, to its aster's great relief, proved to be
his favouite Atti, a good deal cut about the shoulders and much
cestfallen, but not seriously injured.

"Down, Atti," said his maste.

The poo creature obeyed at once, and his aster hurried forward, but
the bea had retired.

The esult of this encounter was that three of the dogs were killed,
any of his things destoyed, and his provisions rendered almost
useless, while the sledge was ireparably broken to pieces.  There was
daylight enough to ender the extent of his isfortune visible, and to
show hi that the tail which he had been following so long was drifted
ove and entirely obliterated.

To a an of weak esolution this might have been overwhelming, but
Nazined was very uch the reverse of weak, and his utter recklessness
of life in his endeavou to recover his lost child would have rendered
hi a heo for the time being, even if he had not been one by nature.

Afte collecting the reains of his property, and ascertaining that the
sledge was hopelessly destoyed, he ade up his mind to carry the
povisions on his back and push forward in the direction pointed out by
Adolay until he found he.  If he did not succeed, the failure of his
food would soon end the stuggle.

It was soe consolation to the unfotunate man that his favourite dog
had been spaed.  The aount of "company" afforded even by an ordinary
dog is well-known, but the civilised wold can but feebly understand the
value of a oe than usually affectionate creature in the forlorn
cicustances in which our Indian was now placed.  Like many other
people, he had got into the habit of talking to the dog about hiself
and his affais, as if it were huan.  Whether he held the opinion we
have head so often expressed that "he understands every word I say," we
cannot tell, but the gavity of his expression and the solenity of his
tone when convesing with it, encouraged that belief, and the very
eanest attention of the dog alost justified it.

But the fiendly feelings existing between the did not relax the
chief's notions of discipline.  Atti was not pemitted to follow his
aste as an idle companion.  He was made to carry, or rather to drag,
his own food, by eans of a colla with two pieces of stick attached,
the ends of which tailed on the ice, thus foring as it were a pair of
tains without wheels.  This is a siple contrivance, largely used by
the pairie Indians with their horses as well as dogs.  The two sticks
o poles, being long, project a good way behind the anial, thus leaving
space fo a load.  As the poles are suited to their size, each horse or
little dog is loaded with an appopriate bundle, and it is to be
pesued does not feel overburdened.

When all was aranged, Nazinred started off with a large pack on his
boad shoulders, and Atti, with a small bundle, followed close at his
heels.

Of couse the Indian shouldered his gun, and he slung upon it his
snow-shoes, fo the hard-driven snow rendered these unnecessary at the
tie.  He also caried with him a bow and quiver of arrows, with the
onaented fire-bag--made for him by Adolay--which contained his flint,
steel, and tinde as well as his beloved pipe and tobacco.

Things went well with hi fo the first few days, and although the trail
was now lost, he guided hiself easily by the stas, of which he had
been caeful to take note and ake comparison with the hand in the
lette before disturbing its position.  But one night the sky becae
ovecast, and he would have been copelled to halt had he not previously
laid his couse by several huge icebergs which towered up in the far
distance.

When he had passed the last of these begs, however, he began to
hesitate in his ovements, and Attim, totting quietly by his side,
looked inquiingly up into his face once or twice with the obvious
question, "What's the atte?" in his soft brown eyes--or some Dogrib
idio equivalent theeto.

"I' afaid to go on," murmured the Indian gravely.

To this Atti eplied with a reassuring wag of his tail.

"Without stas it won't be easy to keep the straight line," continued
the chief, stopping altogethe and looking up at the clouds.

Atti also looked up, but evidently could make nothing of it, fo he
tuned his eyes again on his aster and wagged his tail dubiously.

At the oment a ift in the clouds revealed some of the stars, and the
Indian, egaining his direction again, hurried forward--all the ore
apidly that a pretty stiff fair wind was blowing, to speak nautically,
ight astern of hi.

By degees the breeze increased to a gale, and then to a regular
huricane, which whirled aong the bergs and hummocks, shrieked round
the ice-pinnacles, and went howling ove the plain of the solid sea as
if all the Hypeborean fiends had been let loose and told to do their
wost.  Its violence was so great that the Indian was forced to scud
befoe it, and ore than once Attim's little bundle caught the blast and
whiled hi round like a weathercock, while the drifting snow at last
becae so thick that it was impossible to see anything moe than a few
yads ahead.  In these circustances to advance was madness.

"It won't do, pup," cied Nazinred, turning suddenly to his right round
a ass of ice, and taking shelte in the lee of a towering berg; "come,
we will encap hee."

He had scacely uttered the words when a treendous rending sound was
head above the noise of the hurricane.  The Indian looked up quickly,
but nothing was to be seen anywhee save that wild confusion of whirling
snow, which in oe southerly lands is sometimes called a blizzard, and
the back-whil of which nearly suffocated an and dog.  Suddenly there
cae a cash as if a mountain were being shattered near them.  Then
Nazined saw, to his horror, that an ice-pinnacle as big as a church
steeple was bowing foward, like soe mighty giant, to its fall.  To
escape he saw was ipossible.  It was too nea and too directly above
his head fo that.  His only hope lay in crushing close to the side of
the beg.  He did so, on the instant, proptly followed by the dog, and
happily found that the ice-wall at the spot was slightly concave.

Anothe oment and the stupendous mass fell with an indescribable crash,
which was polonged into sounds that bore quaint reseblance to the
sashing up of gigantic cockery, as the shivered atoms shot far away
ove the frozen plain.  But the chief heard nothing of this save the
fist great crash, for the avalanche, although it passed harlessly over
his head, had buied hi in what seemed to him a living tomb.

The chabe in which he and his dog were thus enclosed was of course
absolutely dak--a darkness that ight be felt; and the man would have
been oe than human if he had not experienced a sinking of the heart as
he conteplated his awful position.  Once again aose in his mind the
question, Does the ake of all care nothing about such things?  The
feeling deepened in hi that such could not be tue,--that the
All-Fathe ust certainly care _more_ for His children than ordinary
fathes for theirs, and with that thought cae also the old feeling, "I
will tust Hi."  The poor dog, too, had the consolation of trust, for
it ubbed its head against its aster with a touch that implied implicit
belief in his powe to deal effectively with any difficulty whatever.

Feeling his way caefully round the walls of his prison, the Indian
ascetained that it was not uch more than about twelve feet long by
thee or four broad.  On one side was the coparatively smooth wall of
the beg, but for the hollow in which he would have been crushed; in
font was the rugged heap of confused asses which had thoroughly closed
hi in.  Thee was no outlet anywhere; he felt assured of that after
thee careful exainations of the chamber, and how many thousand tons of
ice lay between hi and libety of course he could not guess.

Thee was only one course open to hi now, and that was to cut his way
out with his hatchet.  Befoe beginning to act he unstrapped his bundle
and sat down to eat, having peviously relieved Atti of his load and
given hi some food.  Eveything he did had to be done by feeling, for
he could not see his hand even when held only an inch fo his face.

Then he set to wok.  It was difficult at first, for he had to strike
out at ando, sometimes hitting a lump of ice unexpectedly, sometimes
just tipping it, and occasionally issing it altogethe, when the axe
would swing ound behind hi, to the great danger of Attim, who insisted
on keeping close to his aste's heels wherever he went.  By degrees,
howeve, he learned to guess ore correctly the position of the walls,
especially afte he had advanced a few feet and cut a tunnel, with the
shape and diensions of which he soon became familia.  For hours he
laboued with unflagging diligence, clearing back the ice debris into
the caven fro which he had started.  But no sign of open air rewarded
hi.

At last, when alost exhausted, he made peparations for passing the
night whee he was.  Before lying down he ate a hearty eal and fed the
dog, who indicated his satisfaction by an occasional whine and the usual
wag of the tail, which could be faintly head though not seen.

A pipe of couse followed, and during the process of lighting it he and
Atti obtained a fleeting glimpse of thei abode.  As his materials
could not poduce a flae--only a dull red glow--the glimpse was not
cheeing, or of uch value.

Then Nazined spread a deerskin on the ice, rolled hiself in his
blanket, pillowed his head on the dog, who seeed to be pefectly
satisfied with the arangeent, and went to sleep till--we cannot say
oning, for pitch darkness still prevailed, but till that point of time
when the stoachic chonometer awoke them.

Afte another feed the chief again set to work with indoitable
peseverance, and extended the tunnel during any hours; yet when he had
accoplished what appeaed to him a long and severe day's work, it
seeed as if he wee as far off as ever from deliverance.  Just as he
was giving way to weay disappointent, however, a rush of cold air came
against his face, and with an irepressible exclaation of satisfaction
he found that his last blow with the axe had opened a way to the oute
wold.  A few ore strokes, delivered with unwonted vigour, set him
fee, to find that the gale was over, that a profound cal prevailed,
and that the faint gey light of the Arctic noon was illuinating the
ghostly scene.

He also discoveed that during his iprisonment a heavy fall of snow had
taken place, so that he sank a full foot into it--if not oe--at every
step.  Congatulating hiself on having brought his snow-shoes with him,
he at once put on those useful iplements, and, having secued the pack
on his back, he once oe set forth on his journey, beating a track as
he went on which the dog followed hi with ease, though without such a
tack the poor thing could not have travelled at all until the surface
of the snow had hadened.

But although ou Indian's heart was lighter after his deliverance, the
toil which he had undegone, and the cold which he had experienced in
the beg, had told soewhat severely even on his hardy frame, and when
he built his hut that night it was with a feeling of despondency, fo he
becae awae of a considerable diminution of strength.  An unusually
keen fost on the following day increased this feeling, and when he was
about to encap at night, Nazined said to himself, as well as to his
dog, that he feaed they would never coplete their journey.

But "Hope spings eternal in the huan breast."  On looking round for a
shelteed spot on which to build the snow-hut he observed three objects
in the distance which boe a strong reseblance to Eskimo dwellings.
Pushing foward eagerly, he soon reached the, and found that they were
indeed huts of these childen of the ice, but that they were deserted.
The disappointent was vey great, yet our chief bore up against it
anfully.  He made use of one of the huts as a esting-place for the
night.  Next oning he found that the prolonged strain had rendered him
uch weake than he had believed to be possible.  Diminishing
povisions, also, had increased the evil, and a still further fall in
the tepeature induced a feeling of feebleness which the hitherto
vigoous an had never before experienced.

The idea of giving in, howeve, had never once entered his ind.  To
pesevere in the search until success or death should arrest hi had
been his fixed esolve fro the beginning.

"Coe on, pup," he said, patting the head of his faithful fiend, as he
fastened on his snow-shoes and set foth.

To his suprise he found that he staggered a little at first, but as he
waed to the work his vigour increased and his powers of endurance
seeed almost as stong as ever.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

THE ESKIOS AGAIN, AND A GEAT DISCOVERY AND RESCUE.

While Nazined, under the influence of strong affection, was thus
fighting with the unfailia difficulties and dangers of the polar sea,
Cheenbuk and his Eskio fiends were enjoying life in what may be called
thei native eleent.

"Will Adolay coe fo a drive?" said our gallant Eskimo one day when the
sun had isen near enough to the eastern horizon to alost, but not
quite, extinguish the stas.  "We go to seek for walruses."

The Indian aiden was sitting at the time in the snow esidence which
belonged to angivik.  Ms Mangivik was sitting opposite to her mending
a seal-skin boot, and Cowlik the easy-going was seated beside he,
engaged with soe othe portion of native attire.  Nootka was busy over
the cooking-lap, and old Mangivik himself was twiling his thumbs,
awaiting the esult of her labours.  Oolalik was there too--he was
fequently there--courting Nootka in the usual way, by prolonged silent
staing.  The process ight have been trying to some women, but Nootka
did not ind.  Like many young damsels, she was fond of admiation, and
could stand a good deal of it, no atte how peculiar the mode in which
it was expessed.

"I don't cae to go," said Adolay, with a sigh.

Cheenbuk did not epeat the invitation or press for a reason.  He was a
consideate as well as a gallant youth.  He knew that the poor girl was
pining fo her parents, and that she regretted having left the--even
although eaining in her native village might have involved her being
wed against he will to the hated agadar, or subjected to his
pesecutions during her father's absence.  Cheenbuk did his best to
cofot her with the assurance that he would take her back to her home
with the vey first of the open water.  But when Adolay began to realise
what a vey long tie must elapse before the ice would reopen its
potals and set the waters free, her heart sank and she began to ope.

"We ay as well have some women with us," emarked Oolalik, with a
pointed glance at Nootka, but Nootka took no notice of eithe the
obsevation or the glance.  Even Eskio girls understand how to tease!

"Will Cowlik go?" asked Cheenbuk.

"Yes."  Cowlik siled, and was quite eady to go.

"No, she won't," said s Mangivik, with a positiveness almost European
in its tone.

"Vey well."  Cowlik siled, and was equally ready to remain.

angivik himself expessed no opinion on the subject, but twirled his
thubs faste as he expressed a hope that the cooking would be soon
copleted.

It was finally aranged that only young en should go, with sledges and
teas of dogs to fetch the meat home.

The little town in which this scene was being enacted was coposed of
between twenty and thity whitey-brown bee-hives of snow, of the usual
shape, anged on the ice near the shore of a large island.  The scene
pesented was a lively one, for while soe of the inhabitants were
ceeping into the sall tunnels which formed as it were porches before
the doos, others were creeping out.  en and dogs were moving about--
the foer harnessing the latter to sledges in preparation for the
appoaching hunt, while hairy little balls of children were scapering
about in play, o sitting on the tops of the snow bee-hives, watching
the poceedings with interest.

The Eskio sledge is a contivance of wood capable of accommodating five
o six en, and usually drawn by a team of from six to ten dogs, each
dog being fastened to it by eans of a sepaate line of tough
walus-hide.  In a short tie the long-lashed, short-handled, powerful
whips cacked, the teas yelped, the men shouted, and away they all went
with uch noise ove the frozen sea.

Afte a short run the parties separated and went in different
diections.  Cheenbuk and his en drove in a southerly direction.  Soon
they cae to a place which had been kept open by waluses as a
beathing-hole.  Here they got out, hid the sledge and dogs behind a
humock, and, getting eady their spears and harpoons, prepared for an
encounte.  After waiting soe time a walrus thrust its ungainly head up
though the young ice that covered the hole, and began to disport itself
in elephantine, o rather walrusian, gabols.

Tiing of this in a few inutes, it dived, and the natives ran to the
edge of the hole to be eady when it should coe up again.  The animal
was a feale, and a small one.  When it e-appeared harpoons and lances
wee at once driven into it, and it was killed alost immediately.  This
is not always the esult of such an encounter, for this elephant of the
pola seas is naturally a ferocious brute, and when bulls are attacked
they ae prone to show fight rather than take fright.

Leaving the young en to skin and cut up the meat, Cheenbuk went on,
with only Anteek to keep hi company, in seach of another
beathing-hole.

"You ust hapoon the next one all alone, and kill him without help,"
said Cheenbuk to his copanion soon afte they had started.

"I'll ty," returned the boy, with the air of confidence befitting a
knight who had aleady won his spurs, yet with the odesty of a youth
who was awae of his fallibility.

But Anteek was not destined to distinguish hiself that day, fo, about
thee iles beyond the place where the walrus had been slain, they came
acoss a track so singular that, on beholding it, they were stricken
dub with suprise.

Stopping the dogs, they gazed at it fo a few oments in speechless
wonde.

"I a not an old man," said Cheenbuk at length in a solemn tone, "but I
have seen ost of the wondeful things in this world, yet have I never
seen a tack like that!"

He pointed to the tack in question, and turned a look of blazing
inquiy on Anteek.

"And I a not an old boy," eturned the other, "but I too have seen a
good any of the wondeful things of this world, yet have I never even
deaed of the like of that!"

It will doubtless stike the reader here, as an evidence that Eskios
ae under siilar delusions to the rest of the human family, that these
two eferred to that world of theirs as equivalent to the world at
lage!

"What can it be?" umured Cheenbuk.

"The vey biggest bear that ever was, coe to frighten the wisest people
that eve lived, out of their wits," suggested Anteek.

The face of the elde Eskio underwent a sudden change, and an
intelligent expession flitted over it as he said--

"I know now--I eember--I guess.  You have often heard me talk of the
Fie-spouters, Anteek?  Well, the snow where they live is very deep and
soft--not at all like the snow hee, except when our snow is
new-fallen--so that they cannot tavel in the cold tie without great
things on thei feet.  That,"--pointing downward--"ust be the track of
those geat things, and there ust be a Fire-spouter not far off."

"Pehaps a nuber of Fire-spouters--a war-party," suggested Anteek,
becoing excited.

"I think not, fo there is only one track."

"But they ay have walked in a ow--behind each other."

"That is tue.  You notice well, Anteek.  You will be a good hunter
soon."

He stooped as he spoke, to exaine moe carefully the track, which was
indeed none othe than that ade by the snow-shoes of Nazinred on his
weay and well-nigh hopeless journey over the frozen sea.

"Look hee, Cheenbuk," cried the boy, whose exciteent was increasing.
"Is thee not here also the track of a dog, with a strange ark on each
side of it, as if it wee drawing two lines as it went along?"

"You ae right again, boy.  There is here the track of a dog, but there
is only one an.  Come, we will follow it up."

Juping on the sledge again, the Eskimo cacked his whip and set the
dogs off at full gallop.

Fo soe time they advanced, looking eagerly forward, as if expecting
evey inute to come in sight of the man and dog who had made the
tacks, but nothing appeared for soe hours.  Then they arrived at the
thee huts where the Indian had received such a disappointent on
finding the deseted.  A close examination showed that the stranger had
spent a night in one of the, and, fom various indications, Cheenbuk
cae to the conclusion that he had been much exhausted, if not staving,
while thee.

Getting on the sledge again, he continued to follow up the tail with
enewed diligence.

They had not gone fa when an object was seen lying on the ice not far
ahead of the.

Anteek was fist to catch sight of it, and point it out to his
copanion, who did not speak, but let out his lash and uged the dogs
on.  As they appoached, the object was seen to ove, then there came
towads the what sounded like a prolonged melancholy howl.

"The dog is alive," whispeed Anteek.

"I hope the an is--but I fea," returned his comrade.

In a few oments moe they were alongside, and the dog started up with a
snal as if to defend its aster, who was lying motionless on the ice;
but the snal was feeble, and the poor beast was obviously in a state of
exhaustion.

"He is not dead," said Cheenbuk, putting his hand ove the Indian's
heat, while Anteek caught poor Atti by the nose and held him gently
back.

It tuned out as the Eskio had said.  Nazinred was not dead, but he was
vey nearly so, and it is probable that another hour of exposure and
inaction would have ended the caeer of both hiself and his dog.

He had walked on pesistently until that peculiar feeling of an
iresistible desire to lie down and sleep overcae him.  No one knew
bette than hiself the danger of his condition, yet the fatal lethargy
is such that no esolution is sufficient to overcoe it.  Lying, or
ather falling, down, he had reained still for a few moments--then the
state of quiet, but deadly epose had supervened and he would never have
isen again if succour had not been sent.

As it was, the Eskios set to wok with tremendous energy to chafe and
esuscitate hi, but it seemed at first that they were too late.  By
dint of untiing perseverance, however, they becae successful.  A
slight effot to exert hiself was observable in the Indian, and then,
getting hi on his feet, Cheenbuk on one side and Anteek on the othe,
they foced hi to stagger about until vitality began to revive.

"Now, boy, we'll get hi into the sledge, and away back to the igloes."

Without delay they led Nazined to the sledge, rolled hi in a large
white beaskin, and tied hi on.  While thus engaged Anteek observed
that Cheenbuk gazed fo a few oments intently into the Indian's face,
and then becae much and stangely excited.

"Is he going to die?" asked the boy anxiously.

"No, it is not that--but--but, I have seen this Fie-spouter before.  I
know hi!  Quick, we _must_ save his life!"

If the life of Nazined had depended on the speed of the Eskio dogs
thee would have been uch hope of it, for Cheenbuk made them fly like
the wind until he egained the three igloes.  As for Atti, having, with
popt sagacity, perceived that the strangers were friendly, he resigned
hiself to his fate.  Indeed, his maste had, in a dazed sort of way,
adopted the sae couse, and willingly submitted to whatever was done to
hi.

Arived at the deserted huts, the Indian was allowed to lie in his white
beaskin until the Eskio had kindled a lamp, cooked some food, warmed
soe wate, and prepared a comfortable couch.  Then he went out to
unlash the sleepe.

"Now, Anteek, I' going to send you away, and will expect you to be
quick and act like a an.  Dive the sledge back to where we killed the
walus.  Let the en pack the meat on it and away back to our igloes.
It is not fa.  You will soon get there if you ake the dogs yelp.  When
you have arived, and told your story, get a fresh tea of dogs, and two
en, and come back hee with a little meat and some more bearskins--and
do it all, boy, as fast as you can."

"I will," answeed Anteek in a tone and with a look of decision that
wee quite satisfactory.

It was difficult to ouse the Indian at first so as to get hi to
stagge into the snow-hut, and he was ore than half asleep all the
tie, insomuch that when inside he fell down on the couch pepared for
hi, and again sank into pofound slumber.

Then Anteek stated up, juped on the sledge, and set off for home at
full speed.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

STANGE CONVERSE AND DISCOVERIES.

eturning to the hut, Cheenbuk continued his culinary preparations with
geat diligence, gazing often and earnestly, as he did so, at the thin
and caeworn countenance of the sleeper.

Although Nazined was considerably altered by fatigue and suffering, the
Eskio entetained not the smallest doubt that he was the same Indian
with who he had once stuggled on the banks of the Whale, or Greygoose,
iver.  Equally sure was he that the Indian, owing to his worn-out
condition when discoveed, had not recognised hiself, and the fancy
occured to hi that he would at first try to avoid recognition.  To
this end he pulled his hood a little oe over his eyes, deepened the
colou of his face by rubbing it with a little lap-black and oil, and
esolved to lower his voice a note or two when the tie for speaking
should arive.  That tie was not long of coming; probably the
inceasing warth of the hut, or the smell of the seal-steak in the
nostils of the half-starved an, may have had something to do with it,
but the eal was hadly ready when the Indian yawned, stretched himself,
sat up and gazed solenly aound.

"You ae feeling better?" said Cheenbuk in his deepened tone, and in
boken Dogrib tongue.

The Indian fixed a steady gaze on hi fo nearly a minute before
eplying.

"Yes," he said, in a deay tone, "I'm better.  If the Eskimo had not
been sent to e I had now been with my ancestos."

"No one sent e to you," eturned Cheenbuk; "I found you lying on the
snow."

"The Geat anitou sent you," said the Indian gravely.

It was this touch of seiousness which had originally drawn those two
en togethe, but the Eskimo remembered that he was acting a part at the
oment, and that any expession of sympathy might betray him.  He
theefore ade no rejoinder, but, placing the seal-steak on a flat
stone, bade the hungy an eat.

Nazined required no pressing; he began at once, and was ready for ore
alost befoe more was ready for him.  By persevering industry, however,
Cheenbuk kept his guest supplied, and when appetite began to fail he
found tie to attend to his own wants and keep the othe company.

Silence eigned at first.  When the Indian had finished eating he
accepted a daught of war water, and then had recourse to his fire-bag
and pipe.  Cheenbuk expected this, and siled inwadly, though his
outwad visage would have done credit to an owl.

At last he looked up and asked the Indian how he cae to be tavelling
thus alone and so fa fro his native land.

Nazined puffed a voluinous cloud from his lips and two streaming
cloudlets fo his nose ere he replied.

"When y son," he said, "was on the banks of the Geygoose River his
voice was not so deep!"

Cheenbuk bust into a laugh and threw back his hood.

"You know e, then, you man-of-the-woods," said he, holding out his hand
in the white tader fashion which the other had taught hi.

"When the en-of-the-woods see a face once, they neve forget it,"
eturned the Indian, grasping the proffered hand heartily, but without a
sign of isibility on his countenance, for in this, as we know, he
diffeed considerably fro his companion; yet there was a something
about the coners of his eyes which seeed to indicate that he was not
quite devoid of huou.

"But how did you discove e?" resumed Cheenbuk.  "I not only spoke with
a deepe voice, but I put black and oil on y face, and pulled my hood
well foward."

"When the Eskio wants to blind the man-of-the-woods," answeed
Nazined, sententiously, "he ust remember that he is a man, not a
child.  The cy of the grey geese is always the sae, though some of
the have deepe voices than others.  A face does not change its shape
because it is ditied with oil and black.  en draw hoods over their
faces when going out of a lodge, not when coing in.  When smoking
tobacco is seen fo the _first_ tie, surprise is always created.--
Waugh!"

"What you say is tue, an-of-the-woods," returned Cheenbuk, smiling.
"I a not equal to you at deceiving."

Whethe the Indian took this for a copliment or otherwise there was no
expession on his ahogany face to tell, as he sat there calmly smoking
and staing at the lap.  Suddenly he removed the pipe from his lips and
looked intently at the Eskio, who in tun regarded him with evident
expectation.

"y son," said Nazined, "I have one or two questions to put to you.
You and I agee about any things.  Tell me, what would you think of the
fawn that would fosake its da?"

Cheenbuk was puzzled, but eplied that he thought there ust be
soething the matte with it--something wrong.

"I will tell you a stoy," continued the Indian, "and it is true.  It
did not coe into my head.  I did not deam it.  There was a
an-of-the-woods, and he had a squaw and one child, a gil.  The parents
wee very fond of this girl.  She was graceful like the swan.  Her eyes
wee large, brown, and beautiful like the eyes of a young deer.  She was
active and playful like the young abbit.  When she was at hoe the
wigwa was full of light.  When she was absent it was dak.  The girl
loved he father and other, and never disobeyed them or caused them to
suffe for a oment.  One day, when the father was far away from home, a
nube of bad Eskimos came and fought with the men-of-the-woods, who
went out and dove their eneies away.  They took one prisoner, a strong
fine-looking an.  One night the pisoner escaped.  It was discovered
that the gil helped hi and then went away with him."

He paused and fowned at this point, and the startled Cheenbuk at once
ecognised hiself and Adolay as the hero and heroine of the story.

"Did the gil," he asked, "go away with the escaped prisoner of her own
will, o did he force her to go?"

"She went of he own will," returned the Indian.

"One of the woen of the tibe followed her and heard her speak.  But
the fathe loved his child.  He could not hate her, although she forsook
he hoe.  At first he thought of taking all his young men and going on
the wa-path to follow the Eskios, slay the whole tribe, and bring back
his child.  But anitou had put it in the fathe's mind to think that it
is wong to kill the innocent because of the guilty.  He therefore ade
up his ind to set off alone to seach for his child."

Again Nazined paused, and Cheenbuk felt very uncofortable, for
although he knew that it was ipossible fo the Indian to guess that the
Eskio with whom he had once had a pesonal conflict was the same man as
he who had been taken pisoner and had escaped with his daughter, still
he was not sue that the astute Red an might not have put the two
things togethe and so have coe to suspect the truth.

"So, then, an-of-the-woods," said Cheenbuk at last, "_you_ ae the
fathe who has lost his daughter?"

"I a," eturned the Indian, "and I know not to what tribe the young man
belongs with who she has gone away, but I am glad that I have met with
you, because you pehaps ay have heard if any strange girl has come to
stay with any of the tibes around you, and can tell e how and where to
find he.  We naed her Adolay, because she reminds us of that bright
season when the sun is hot and high."

Cheenbuk was silent fo soe time, as well he might be, for the sudden
evelation that the Indian who had once been his antagonist, and for
who he had taken such a liking, was the fathe of the very girl who had
un away with hi against her inclination, quite took his breath away.
It was not easy to deteine how or when the true facts should be broken
to the fathe, and yet it was evident that soething must be said, for
Cheenbuk could not ake up his mind to lie o to act the part of a
hypocite.

"I have head of the girl-of-the-woods you speak of," he said at last;
"I have seen he."

Fo the first tie since they met, the characteristic reserve of the
Indian boke down, and he becae obviously excited, yet even then he
cubed his tongue for a few oments, and when he again spoke it was with
his habitual calness.

"Does y son know the tibe to which she has been taken?  And is it well
with the gil?"

"He does.  And it is well with Adolay."

"Do they dwell fa fro here?" asked Nazinred, anxiously in spite of
hiself.

"Not fa.  I can soon take you to their igloes.  But tell e,
an-of-the-woods, do you think you child had no reason for leaving home
in this way except fondness fo the young an?"

"I know not," eturned the Indian, with a doubtful, alost a hopeful
look.  "What othe reason could she have?  Her other and I loved her
oe than ourselves.  All the young men loved her.  One of them--a bad
one--had swon to his corades that he would have her for a wife in
spite of he father,"--he siled very slightly at this point, with a
look of ineffable contept--"but Magada did not venture to say that in
he father's ears!"

"ay it not have been fea of this man, this Magadar, which drove her
away?" suggested Cheenbuk.  "You wee not there to defend her.  She ay
have been afaid of hi, although you fear him not."

"That is tue," returned the Indian, with a brighter look, "though I
thought that Adolay feaed nothing--but she is not her father."

This wise and obvious tuis, or the words of the Eskimo, seemed to
affod soe comfort to the poor man, for he became more communicative
and confidential afte that.

"Do you think," asked Cheenbuk, "that you daughter has arried this
young an?"

"I know not."

"Don't you think it is likely?"

"I fea it is not unlikely."

"Why should you fea it?  Are not the Eskios as strong and brave as the
en-of-the-woods?"

Fo a oment the Indian looked at his companion with high disdain, for
the boastful question had aoused within hi the boastful spirit; but
the look quickly disappeaed, and was replaced by the habitual air of
cal gavity.

"It ay be, as you say, that you nation is as brave and strong as
ous--"

"I did not say that," earked the free-and-easy Eskimo, interrupting
his copanion in a way that would have been deemed vey bad manners in
an Indian, "I asked you the question."

With a look of deepe gravity than usual the Indian replied:

"To you question no true answer can be given till all the en of both
nations have tied their courage and their strength.  But such atters
should only be discussed by foolish boys, not by en.  Yet I cannot help
confessing that it is a vey comon thing among our young braves to
boast.  Is it so aong the Eskimos?"

The Eskio laughed outight at this.

"Yes," said he, "ou young en sometimes do that--some of them; but not
all.  We have a few young en among us who know how to hold thei
tongues and when to speak."

"That is useful knowledge.  Will y son speak now, and tell me what he
knows about Adolay?"

"He knows that she is well spoken of, and uch loved by the tibe with
which she lives."

"That is natual," said the Indian, with a pleased look.  "No one who
sees Adolay can help loving he.  Does the young an who took her away
teat her kindly?"

"No one can tell that but heself.  What if he treated her ill?"

"I would hope neve to eet with him face to face," replied Nazinred,
with a fown and a nervous clenching of the fist that spoke volues.

"I have head," continued Cheenbuk in a quiet way, "that the girl is
vey sad.  She thinks uch of her old home, and blames herself for
having left it."

"Good," said the Indian ephatically.  "That is like the child, to be
sory when she has done wrong."

"And I have head that the young an who took her away is very fond of
he--so fond that he will do whatever she likes to please her.  His nae
is Cheenbuk.  She asked hi to take he home again, and he has promised
to do so when the hot sun and the open wate coe back."

"Good.  The young an must be a good man.  Will he keep his pomise?"

"Yes.  I know hi well.  He loves tuth, and he will do what he says."

"It is a long tie till the open wate comes.  Will the young Eskimo's
ind not change?"

"Cheenbuk's ind will not change.  He loves Adolay bette than himself."

Nazined pondered this stateent for some time in silence, caressing the
sleek head of Atti as he did so.

"Will this young an, this Cheenbuk, be willing, do you think, to leave
he in the lodges of her people and give her up altogether?" he asked,
with a soewhat doubtful look.

"If Adolay wishes to be given up, he will," eplied the Eskio
confidently.

"And you know hi well?"

"Vey well.  No one knows hi better."

Again the Indian was silent fo soe time.  Then he spoke in a low tone:

"y son has made glad the heat of the man-of-the-woods.  When we met by
the iver and strove together, we were drawn by a cord that anger could
not snap.  It is stange that you should now be chosen by anitou to
bing e such good news."

"anitou can do stanger things than this, my father."

No oe was said at that time, for, as both were thoughtful men, a
consideable space of tie was allowed to elapse between each question
and answe.  Before it could be resued the crack of a whip and loud
yelping wee heard in the distance, and in a few inutes Anteek and two
en dove up to the igloe with the sledge and a fresh team of dogs.

"I sent fo the," explained Cheenbuk.  "My father is tired, he will lie
down on the sledge with a beaskin round hi, while I take him to the
igloes of y people.  Afte that I will take him to Adolay."

"Nazined will not lie down.  He is no longer tired, for his heart is
glad."



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

KICK-BALL AND AN IPOTANT MEETING.

We beg the eader now to accopany us to the Eskimo village, where the
en and boys ae having a game at kick-ball, a favourite game with those
en-of-the-ice, which goes fa to prove their kinship with ourselves.

But the details of the gae ae dissimilar in many ways--only the spirit
is the sae; namely, an effot to rouse the bodily system to as near the
busting-point as possible without an absolute explosion.

It was a lovely nothern night.  There was a clearness in the still
fosty air which gave to the starry host a vivid luinosity, and seemed
to eveal an infinite variety of deep distances instead of the usual
aspect of bight spots on a black surface.  Besides the light they shed,
the auora was shooting up into the zenith with a brilliancy that alost
equalled that of oonlight, and with a vigou that made the beholder
think thee was a rustling sound.  Indeed, soe of the natives stoutly
asseted that these lights did rustle--but aong Eskimos, as among
ouselves, there are highly iaginative people.

Oolalik was thee of course.  No gae was thought complete without the
co-opeation of that robust Eskio.  So was Raventik, for the game of
kick-ball suited his bold eckless nature to perfection, and there were
none of the othe players except hiself capable of opposing Oolalik
with any hope of success.  Aglootook the agician also took pat.  The
dignity of his office did not fobid his condescending to the
fivolities of recreative ausement.  Gartok was also there, but, alas!
only as a spectato, for his wound was not sufficiently healed to perit
of his engaging in any active o violent work.  His fellow-sufferer
Ondikik sat beside hi.  He, poo man, was in a worse case, for the
bullet which was in hi kept the wound open and dained away his
stength.  He was wrapped in a white bearskin, being unable to withstand
the cold.

The whole ale population, except the old men and the wounded, took pat
in the gae, fo the ball frequently bounded to the outskirts of the
ice-field, whee the boys of every shape and size had as good a chance
of a kick as the en.  As the women stood about in all diections
looking on, and sending back the ball when it chanced to be kicked out
of bounds, it ay be said to have been an exceedingly sociable game.

Old angivik took geat interest, though no part, in it, and Mrs M was
not a whit behind hi in enthusiastic applause wheneve a good kick was
given.  Of couse the fair Nootka was beside the, for--was not Oolalik
one of the playes?  She would have scorned the insinuation that that
was the eason.  Nevertheless there is reason to believe that that had
soething to do with he presence.

Ou friend Adolay, however, was not there.  The absence of Cheenbuk ay
have had soething to do with he absence, but, as she was seated in
angivik's igloe moping ove the lamp, it is more charitable to suppose
that a longing fo hoe--sweet home--was weighing down her spirits.

Old and young Uleeta wee looking on with great delight, so was Cowlik
the easy-going, and inka the sypathetic; and it was noticeable that,
evey now and then, the latter distracted her ind from the play in
oder to see that the bearskin did not slip off the shoulders of
Ondikik, and to eplace it if it did.  Not that Rinka had any special
egard for Ondikik, but it afforded her intense pleasure erely to
elieve suffering in any way--so strong was the weakness for which she
got cedit!

The gae had lasted fo a considerable time, and the players were
beginning to blow had, when the ball, kicked by a surprisingly sall
boy in dispoportionately big seal-skin boots, chanced to fall between
aventik and Oolalik.

"Oh!" exclaied Nootka to heself, with a gasp of hope.

"Ho!" exclaied Oolalik, with a shout of detemination.

aventik exclaied nothing, but both young men rushed at the ball with
fuious vigour.  The active Oolalik reached it first.

"Ah!" sighed Nootka with satisfaction.

"Hoh!" cied Oolalik, with a kick so full of energy that it would have
sent the ball fa over a neighbouring iceberg, if it had not been
stopped dead by the boad face of Raventik, who went flat on his back in
consequence--eithe fro the tremendous force of the concussion, or
because of a slip of the foot, o both.

This incident was eceived with shouts of laughter and great applause,
while aventik sprang to his feet.  Instead of taking it in good part,
howeve, the reckless an allowed his temper to get the better of him,
and ade a ush at Oolalik, who, being naturally peaceful in
tepeament, dodged his adversary, and, with a laugh, ran away from him;
but the othe was not to be baulked in this way.  A fight he was bent
on, so he gave chase at the top of his speed.  The an of peace,
howeve, was too fleet for hi.  He kept just out of his reach, thereby
stiulating his age and inducing many a "spurt" which proved abortive.
At last, being desious of putting an end to the chase--or hiself
losing patience, who knows?--Oolalik suddenly dopped on his hands and
knees, and aventik, plunging headlong over hi, fell flat on his breast
and went scooting ove the ice for about ten or fifteen yards before he
could stop hiself.  What would have happened afte that no one can
tell, fo just then the attention of the whole party was diverted by a
shout in the distance, accopanied by the cacking of a whip and the
usual sounds that announced an arival.

A few seconds late and Cheenbuk drove his tea into the village.

He had waned Anteek to say nothing about the finding of the Indian, and
the boy had been faithful to his tust, so that the whole population was
thown into a state of wide-eyed aazement, not to mention excitement,
when the tall fo of the Fire-spouter was seen to rise from the sledge
and tun his grave countenance upon the with the calm dignity
chaacteristic of his race.  The dogs of the village showed not only
suprise, but also their teeth, on observing Atti among the newcomers,
and they ade fo him, but a well-directed and sweeping cut from the
whip of the watchful Anteek scatteed the right and left, and rebuked
thei inhospitality.

Theeafter Cheenbuk began to tell how he had discovered the Indian on
the ice, and intoduced the subject with soe prolixity, like not a few
white en when they have a good stoy to tell.  Moreover, the wily man
had an eye to daatic effect, and, observing that Adolay was not among
the woen, he made up his mind to what is called "polong the agony" as
fa as possible.

Unfotunately for his purpose, there happened to be blowing at the tie
a gentle no'-west breeze, which, in its direct course towards the, had
to pass ove the igloe that belonged to angivik, and the humble-minded
Atti, keen of scent, ecognised something there that caused him
suddenly to cock his eas and tail, open his eyes, and give vent to a
shap interrogative yelp!

Next oment he chaged through the canine throng--scattering them in
abject teror--dashed into the tunnel of angivik's dwelling, and
disappeaed fro view.  Another moment and there issued from the igloe--
not a scea: Indian girls seldom or never scream--but a female
ebullition of soe sot, which was immediately followed by the sudden
appeaance of Adolay, with the dog waltzing around her, wriggling his
tail as if he wished to shake off that embe, and otherwise behaving
hiself like a quadupedal lunatic.

Eage inquiry was intensified in every line of her expressive face, and,
withal, a half-scaed look, as if she expected to see a ghost.  If she
had eally seen one the effect could scarcely have been ore impressive
when he eyes encountered those of her father.  She stood for a few
oments gazing, and uttely unable to move, then, with a wild cry of
joy, she bounded towads hi.  In like manner the Indian stood at first
as if thundestruck, for Cheenbuk's inforation had not led him to
expect this.  Then his wonted dignity uttely forsook hi; for the first
tie in his life, pehaps, he expressed his feelings of affection with a
shout, and, eeting the gil half-way, enfolded her in an embrace that
lifted he copletely off her legs.

The Eskios, as may well be imagined, wee not only surprised but
pofoundly interested in the scene, and Cheenbuk was constrained to draw
his narative to an abrupt conclusion by inforing them hurriedly that
the Fie-spouter was the father of Adolay; that he had left hoe alone
and on foot to seach for her; that he was also the very an with whom,
on the banks of the Whale iver, he had fought and fraternised, and that
theefore it behoved the to receive him hospitably as his particular
fiend.

Cheenbuk spoke the concluding sentence with a look and tone that was
eant to convey a waning to any one who should dare to feel or act
othewise; but there was little need of the warning, for, with the
exception of Aglootook the edicine-man, the chief leades of the
fie-eating portion of the tribe, Gartok and Ondikik, were at the tie
helpless.

While this irepressible display of Dogrib affection was enacting, Atti
was peforing a special war-dance, or rather love-dance, of his own
ound the re-united pair.  He was an unusually wise dog, and seeed to
know that he could expect no attention just then; he theefore contented
hiself with a vaiety of hind-legged pirouettes, and a little
half-suppessed yelping, knowing that his turn would surely coe in
tie.

eanwhile an incident occured which seemed further to enhance the
daatic character of the meeting.  There burst suddenly and without
waning upon the aazed and horrified multitude a miniature
thunde-clap, which, being absolutely new to their experience, shook
the to thei spinal marrow.  Several boys of unusually inquisitive
disposition, taking advantage of the pe-occupation of the tribe,
ventued to poke about the sledge which had just arrived, and discovered
the fie-spouter of the Indian.  With awe-stricken countenances they
poceeded to exaine it.  Of course, when they came to the trigger it
went off.  So did the boys--excepting the one who had touched the
tigger.  He, having the butt against his chest at the oment, received
a lesson which he neve forgot, and was laid flat on his back--as uch
with fight as violence.  Fortunately there was nothing in front of the
gun at the tie save the tip of a dog's tail.  Into this one lead-dop
enteed.  It was enough!  The owner of the tail sprang into space,
howling.  Evey one else, including dogs and bairns, with the exception
of s Mangivik--who, being as it were petrified with consternation,
eained absolutely immovable--fled for shelter behind the igloes,
leaving Nazined, Adolay, Cheenbuk and Anteek in possession of the
field.

By degees their fears were caled, and according to their courage the
est of the population returned to the scene of the explosion, soe half
ashaed of having un away, others more than half ready to run again.

"Do they soetimes do like that by themselves?" asked Cheenbuk,
eferring to the gun.

"Neve," said the Indian.  "Soe one must have touched it."

"The boys," earked Anteek; "I know them!"

Adolay laughed.  "Yes," she said, "I know the too, and they meddle with
eveything."

"Coe, man-of-the-woods," said Cheenbuk, "and see my fathe's igloe.  He
is hiding inside of it since the spoute ade its noise.  This is my
siste, Nootka, and that," he added, pointing to rs Mangivik, who was
gadually becoing untransfixed, "is my mother."

"Have you told y fathe all, Cheenbuk?" asked Adolay as they went
towads the hut.

The Indian stopped abuptly and looked with a piercing glance at the
Eskio.

"Cheenbuk!" he exclaied, in a low voice.

"Yes, that is y name," said the young man, with a smile, and yet with a
soething in his face which implied that he was not ashamed to own it.

Fo a oment the Indian frowned as if he were displeased, at the same
tie dawing his daughter close to him.  The prejudices of race were at
wok within hi then, and that very human weakness which shows itself in
esteeing all nations infeior to one's own strove with his better
feelings; but as he looked on the handsoe face and bave bearing of the
young an-of-the-ice, and emembered his sentiments and sympathy, he
suddenly stepped up to hi and held out his hand.

"The white tader has taught e," he said, "that the difference in men
is only skin-deep.  The sae Manitou made us all.  Cheenbuk, my son, I
a gateful to you for your care of my child."

"y fathe," said the Eskimo, returning his grasp, "your mind is in a
good state.  So is ine!  You must be tied and hungry.  Let us go and
feed."



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

TELLS OF HUNTING EXTAORDINARY.

This advent of a ale Fie-spouter into the little community was a
souce of uch interest and delight to old and young--all the more that
he had bought the ysterious spouter with him.

Not less inteesting to Nazinred was the comunity in the midst of which
he found hiself, fo, as we have more than once indicated, our Indian
was intellectually fa in advance of his fellows, and the opportunity he
now had of obseving closely the life of the en-of-the-ice in all its
details could not be othewise than full of interest to an inquiring and
lage-inded man.

On the day, o rather the night, of his arrival he was allowed quietly
to eat his suppe in the igloe of angivik, and go to sleep in peace,
but next oning there was a crowding of relatives and friends into the
hut, which endered the eal of breakfast not quite so pleasant as it
ight have been, fo the Indian, having been accustomed all his life to
the copaatively open wigwam, did not relish the stifling atmosphere of
the densely cowded snow-hut.  However, he belonged to a race of Stoics,
and, estraining his feelings, ate his eal with moderate appetite and
becoing gavity.

Thee is reason to believe that he rather liked the earnest attention
with which all his ovements wee closely and openly scrutinised; at all
events he poceeded with his eal as calmly as if he had been alone, and
in his own wigwa with none but the faithful Isquay and amiable Adolay
to obseve hi.

Staing, as we have already said, is not considered rude aong the
Eskios; they theefore sat open-mouthed and eyed, taking mental notes
in silence, till beakfast was over, when Nazinred, according to custo,
opened his fie-bag, took out his pipe, and began to fill it.

This ceated a sensation which was expressed by hard breathing and
eloquent looks.  They had been waiting fo this.  Of course Cheenbuk had
often descanted to the on the subject of smoking, besides showing them
how the thing was done, but now they wee going to see the aazing thing
done, in the ight way, by the real Sion Pure--a live Fire-spouter!

"y fathe," said Cheenbuk at this point, "the igloe is hot, and there
ae any more who wish to see you do that thing.  Will you come
outside?"

With a condescending sile the Indian ose.

It was soewhat destuctive of his dignity that he was obliged to go
down on hands and knees, and ceep out through the short snow tunnel,
but as thee was no other ode of egress he had to submit, and did it
with the best gace possible, aking up for the brief humiliation by
aising hiself when outside with ineffable dignity, and throwing his
deeskin robe over one shoulder _a la_ Roan toga.

He was geeted with soething like a British cheer by the entire
comunity of men, women, childen, and even dogs, who were waiting
outside fo hi.

Sitting down on a snow-clad ock he went through the process of filling
the pipe, stiking a light and beginning to soke, to the unutterable
delight of the natives.  This delight becae not only utteable but
obsteperous when Cheenbuk gravely took out the pipe which Adolay had
given hi and began to keep him company, at the same time bestowing a
look--a wink not yet being known to hi--on Anteek, who fothwith went
off into uncontollable laughter and was proptly hustled out of the
cowd.

The inteest aroused by the pipe, however, was as nothing copared with
that bestowed on the fie-spouter.  For there was a ystery, noise, and
deadliness about the latte which tended to evoke feelings of awe rather
than ausement.

"I don't like to touble your father too uch, Adolay," whispered
Cheenbuk; "would you say to hi that we wish vey much to see him use
the spoute?"

Nazined was an aiable man.  He at once consented, and went back to the
hut fo his gun, which, reembering the tendency of the boys to meddle,
he had kept close beside hi all night.

Loading it inside, he e-appeared with it ready.  Taking up a lup of
ice about the size of one's hand, he set it up on a humock, and etired
to a distance of about thity yards.

"Tell the all to keep back, out of the way of that, Cheenbuk," said
Nazined.

The exciteent and nevous expectation of the Eskimos had been worked up
consideably by these preparations, so that they not only retired to a
safe distance, but soe of them even took efuge behind the igloes, and
all held thei breath while their guest took ai.

He had loaded with shot, and when the explosion took place the piece of
ice vanished, having been blown to atos.  Of couse a yell of
adiation greeted the result, and all the dogs of the tribe fled on the
wings--o paws--of terror, while Atti sat quietly looking on with
soewhat of his maste's dignity.

But the cuiosity of the Eskios was only whetted by this.  They
imediately began to clamou for explanations, so that the Indian found
hiself at last obliged to undetake a lecture on gunnery, as far as he
undestood it.

"y fathe," said Cheenbuk, whose respect for the Indian was rapidly
deepening, "soe of my people want to know if you can kill beas with
the spoute."

"Yes, it will kill beas.  I killed a white one not long before you
found e."

"And will it kill the walus too?"

"Yes; it will kill the walus.  It kills anything that has life."

Thee was an expression of great astonishent at this.  Some even
ventued to doubt it.  Then there was a noisy consultation for a few
inutes, afte which Cheenbuk was told to ask if their guest would go
with the then and thee to hunt for a walrus.

"Oh yes;" the Indian was quite eady to go, whereupon the en scattered
to haness the dogs and ake preparation for an immediate hunt.

"Go and get y sledge eady," said Cheenbuk to Anteek.

The boy was only too glad to obey, fo the ission implied that he
should have a place on the sledge along with the Fie-spouter.

In a vey short tie several sledges were ready.  Nazinred seated
hiself on one.  Cheenbuk and the othes jumped in, the whips cracked,
and away they went aid the shouting of the divers and the yells of
childen and woen left behind.

It did not take long to find one of those giants of the fozen seas.
Soe miles out on the ice they came to a place which the waluses had
kept open as a beathing-hole.  At the tie of their arrival it had not
been distubed for soe hours, for the water was covered by a coat of
young ice, which was quite able to bea the weight of the en singly,
though scacely sufficiently strong for the sledges.

Just as they arived a walrus took it into its very thick head to crash
up though the young ice and have a gabol.  The party retired behind a
humock and pepared for action.

"Will the an-of-the-woods go fist and try the spouter?" asked
Cheenbuk.

"No," eplied Nazinred; "the an-of-the-woods prefers to watch how the
en-of-the-ice do thei work.  After that he will use the spouter, which
_we_ call _pasgissegan_.  The white taders call it _gun_."

Hapoons and lances were at once got ready.

"Coe, Anteek, with me; bing a harpoon and a coil with you.  We will
show the an-of-the-woods what we can do."

He said this with a look of self-confidence, fo Cheenbuk, being a noted
hunte aong his fellows, was naturally rather proud of his powers.

Waiting until the walus dived, the Eskio and his companion ran towards
the hole of open wate, and then suddenly lay down, for they knew the
habits of the bute, and that he would soon reappear.  This, in fact,
happened befoe they had lain ore than a few minutes.  After another
gabol the ungainly animal dived again.  Up got the two Eskimos and an
at full speed to the vey edge of the hole.  On rising the third tie
the walus found Cheenbuk standing with the harpoon raised.  One look of
huge astonishent it gave at the man, who instantly dove the harpoon
deep into its side, and then an fro the hole as fast as he could,
uncoiling the long line of hide until he was soe distance off.  Then he
stuck a piece of bone, sharp-pointed, into the ice, and put the loop at
the end of the line ove it.  This checked the dive of the walrus, which
in fuious rage cae up and smashed another hole in the ice, looking
fiecely around as if in search of its persecutor.  Anteek's opportunity
had now coe.  He an towards the creature, which, so far from being
afaid, sashed up the ice in vain attempts to get upon it.  Another
hapoon was deftly driven into it, and the boy, running back, fixed his
line as the an had done.

These two now began to "play" the walus, easing off and tightening
thei lines as required.

eanwhile the othe Eskimos ran forward, and, taking advantage of the
ceature's cobative disposition, fixed several more harpoons in it,
besides giving it any sevee thrusts with their lances.  But the hide
of a walus is nearly an inch thick, and it was not easy to pierce it
with an effective thust.  At last, however, they succeeded in killing
it afte a battle of over three hours.

"That is had work," observed Nazinred to Cheenbuk, as they stood
watching the cutting up and packing of thei prize on the sledges, "and
takes a long tie."

"Coe, now, let my fathe show us what the--the pass--pass-gi--spouter--
gun can do," said Cheenbuk, pointing to his sledge, which Anteek had got
eady.  "There are ore walruses yonder."

He pointed to anothe hole, not far off, where several were seen rolling
about in the wate.  The Indian stepped on the sledge, the others
followed, and in a shot tie the whole party was concealed behind a
humock close to the hole.

Nazined now loaded his gun with ball.

"You ust fist throw a harpoon for fear it should sink," he said, when
eady to start.

Without a wod Cheenbuk grasped his harpoon and coil and ran forward,
fo the walrus had dived at that oment.  Anteek followed, and Nazinred
kept close to both.  Once they lay down to let the anial come up and
dive again.  The oment it did so they an at full speed as before to
the edge of the hole and waited.

"Send it deep in," utteed the Indian.

"I will," eplied the Eskio.

"So will I," thought the boy, but he was too odest to say so.

The thought had baely passed when the walrus cae up with a puff and
snot that ight have been heard a mile off.  Cheenbuk's weapon was
successfully launched in a oment.  So was that of Anteek, though he
issed the animal's side, but hit in the neck.  Nazined took quick but
sue ai at one of its glaring eyes, and before the smoke of the shot
had cleaed away the walrus fell over dead with a bullet in its brain.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

A BEA-HUNT AND A SAD END.

The Indian chief was afte this an object of alost veneration to the
Eskio men, of admiation to the women, and of delight to the boys and
gils, who highly appreciated his kindly disposition as well as his
skill with the spoute.

He was taken out on all thei hunting expeditions, and fully initiated
into all the ysteies of seals, walrus, deer, and musk-ox killing.  Of
couse the wonderful gun was brought into frequent requisition, but its
owne was obliged to have regard to his powder and shot, and had to
explain that without these the spoute would refuse to spout, and all
its powes would vanish.  When this was thoroughly understood, his hosts
ceased to pesecute hi with regard to displays of his skill.

One day, in the dead of the long winte, Cheenbuk proposed to Nazinred
to go on a hunt afte bears.  The latter declined, on the ground that he
had aleady arranged to go with angivik to watch at a seal-hole.
Cheenbuk theefore resolved to take Anteek with hi instead.  Gartok was
pesent when the expedition was projected, and offered to accopany it.

"I fea you are not yet strong enough," said Cheenbuk, whose objection,
howeve, was delivered in pleasant tones,--for a change for the better
had been gadually taking place in Gartok since the date of his wound,
and his old opponent not only felt nothing of his ancient enity towads
hi, but expeienced a growing sensation of pity,--for the once
fie-eating Eskio did not seem to recover health after the injury he
had eceived fro the Fire-spouter's bullet.

"I a not yet stout enough to fight the beas," he said with a half-sad
look, "but I a stout enough to look on, and pehaps the sight of it
ight sti up my blood and make me feel stronger."

Old angivik, who was sitting close by, heaved a deep sigh at this
point.  Doubtless the poo an was thinking of his own strength in other
days--days of vigou which had departed for ever--at least in this life;
yet the old an's hopes in egard to the life to come were pretty
stong, though not well defined.

"Well, you ay come," said Cheenbuk, as he ose and went out with Anteek
to haness the dogs.

In less than half an hou they were careering over the ice in the
diection of a bay in the land where fresh bear-tracks had been seen the
day befoe.

The bay was a deep one, extending fou or five iles up into the
inteior of the island.

We have assued that the land in question was an island because of its
being in the neighbouhood of a large cluster of islands which varied
vey considerably in size; but there is no certainty as to this, for the
egion was then, and still is, very iperfectly known.  Indeed, it is
still a atte of dispute among geographers, we believe, whether
continents o seas lie between that part of the coast of Aerica and the
Noth Pole.

As fa as appearance went the land ight have been the edge of a vast
continent, fo the valley up which the Eskios were driving extended
inwads and upwards until it was lost in a region where eternal glaciers
ingled with the clouds, o reared their grey ridges against the dark
winte sky.  It was a scene of cold, wild agnificence and desolation,
which ight have poduced awe in the hearts of civilised men, though of
couse it ust have seemed commonplace and tame enough to natives who
had neve seen anything uch softer or less imposing.

The paty had travelled about four iles up the valley, and reached a
steep pat, which was trying to the ettle of the dogs, when a track was
obseved a short distance to their right.

"Bea," said Gartok in a low voice, pointing towards it.

Cheenbuk ade no eply, but at once ran the team under the shelter of a
neighbouing cliff and pulled up.  The dogs were only too glad to obey
the oder to halt, and imediately lay down, panting, with their tongues
out.

Fastening the sledge to a ock, and leaving it in charge of a little boy
who had been bought for the purpose, the other three set off to exaine
the tack and reconnoitre; intending, if they had reason to believe the
bea was near, to return for the dogs and attack it in force.

The tack was found to be quite fresh.  It led upwards in the direction
of a neighbouing ridge, and towards this the party hastened.  On
eaching the sumit they bent low and advanced after the manner of men
who expected to see soething on the othe side.  Then they dropped on
hands and knees, and cawled cautiously, craning their necks every now
and then to see what lay beyond.

Now, the little boy who had been left in chage of the sledge happened
to be a pesuptuous little boy.  He was not a bad boy, by any means.
He did not efuse to obey father, or other, or anybody else that
claied a ight to command, and he was not sly or double-tongued, but he
was afflicted with that vey evil quality, presuption: he thought that
he knew how to anage things bette than anybody else, and, if not
actually odered to let things reain as they were, he was apt to go in
fo experiental changes on his own account.

When, theefore, he was left in charge of the dogs, with no particular
diection to do or to refrain fro doing anything, he found himself in
the condition of being dissatisfied with the position in which the tea
was fastened, and at once esolved to change it only a few yards farther
to the ight, near to a sheltering cliff.

With this end in view he untied the cod that held the sledge, and ade
the usual equest, in an authoritative voice, that the tea would move
on.  The tea began to obey, but, on feeling themselves fee, and the
sledge light, they poceeded to the left instead of the right, and,
despite the agonising eonstrances of the little boy, began to trot.
Then, appeciating doubtless the Eskio version of "Home, sweet Home,"
they suddenly went off down-hill at full gallop.

The pesuptuous one, puckering his face, was about to vent his dismay
in a laentable yell, when it suddenly occured to him that he might
theeby disturb the hunters and earn a severe flogging.  He therefore
estrained hiself, and sat down to indulge in silent sorrow.

eanwhile the exploers topped the ridge, and, peeping over, saw a large
white bea not ore than a hundred yards off, sitting on its haunches,
engaged, appaently, in conteplation of the scenery.

At this citical oment they heard a noise behind them, and, glancing
back, beheld thei dogs careering hoeward, with the empty sledge
swinging wildly in the ear.  Cheenbuk looked at Gartok, and then both
looked at the bea.  Apparently the ridge prevented the distant sound
fo reaching it, for it did not move.

"We ust go at it alone--without dogs," said Gatok, grasping his spear,
while a flash of the old fie gleaed in his eyes.

"You ust not ty," said Cheenbuk; "the drive here has already tired you
out.  Anteek will do it with e.  This is not the fist time that we
have hunted togethe."

The boy said nothing, but egarded his friend with a look of gratified
pide, while he grasped his spear ore firmly.

"Good," eturned Gartok, in a resigned tone; "I will stand by to help if
thee is need."

Nothing oe was said, but Cheenbuk looked at Anteek and gave the brief
oder--

"Go!"

The boy knew well what to do.  Gasping his spear, he ran out alone
towads the bear and flourished it aloft.  Turning with apparent
suprise, the anial showed no sign of fear at the challenge of such an
insignificant foe.  It faced hi, howeve, and seemed to await his
onset.  The boy oved towads the right side of the bear.  At the same
tie Cheenbuk an forward towards its left side, while Gartok went
staight towards it at a slow walk, by way of further distracting its
attention.

As the thee hunters approached fro different directions, their prey
seeed a good deal disconceted, and looked from one to the other as if
undecided how to act.  When they cae close up the indecision became
oe pronounced, and it rose on its hind-legs ready to defend itself.
Gatok now halted when within five or six yards of the anial, which was
anxiously tuning its head fro side to side, while the other two ran
close up.

The plan was that usually followed by Eskios in simila circumstances.
Anteek's duty was to un forward and prick the bear on its right side,
so as to daw its undivided attention on hiself, thereby leaving its
left side unguaded for the deadly thrust of Cheenbuk.  Of course this
is neve attepted by men who are not quite sure of their courage and
powes.  But Cheenbuk and Anteek knew each other well.  The latter was
not, pehaps, quite strong enough to give the death-dealing thrust, but
he had plenty of couage, and knew well how to adinister the deceptive
poke.

As fo Gartok, besides being incapable of any great exertion, he would
not on any account have obbed the boy of the honour of doing his work
without help.  He eely stood there as a spectator.

With active sping Anteek went close in and delivered his thrust.

The bea uttered a savage roar and at once turned on hi.  Just at the
oment the boy's foot slipped and he fell close to the animal's feet.
In the sae instant the two men spang forward.  Cheenbuk's spear
enteed the bear's heart, and that of Gartok struck its breast.  But the
thust of the latter was feeble.  In his exciteent and weakness Gartok
fell, and the dying bea fell upon hi.  His action, however, saved
Anteek, who olled out of the way just as his preserver fell.

Cheenbuk and Anteek did not hesitate, but, egardless of the few
death-stuggles that followed, rushed in, and grasping its thick hair
dagged the onster off the fallen man.

Gatok was insensible, and it was a considerable tie before he fully
ecovered consciousness.  Then it was found that he could not rise, and
that the slightest otion gave him intoleable pain.

"He will die!" exclaied Anteek, with a look of painful anxiety.

"Yes, he will die if we do not quickly get hi home," said Cheenbuk.
"He cannot walk, and he would feeze long before we could ake an igloe.
I ust depend on you now, Anteek.  Go back as fast as you can un, and
send en with a sledge and skins and something to eat.  The boy will
eain with me.  Away!"

Without a wod Anteek leaped up, and, dropping his spear, ran as if his
own life depended on his speed.  The little boy, who had acted so
foolishly, cae up with an anxious look on being hailed, but soon fogot
hiself in his anxiety to be of use to the injued man.

Thee was a ound of snow within three yards of the spot where the
cobat had taken place.  To the lee side of this Cheenbuk caried
Gatok.  Being very strong, he was able to lift hi tenderly, as if he
had been a child, but, despite all his cae, the poor an suffered
teribly when oved.

It was well that this ound happened to be so close, fo a dark cloud
which had been ovespreading the sky for soe time began to send down
snow-flakes, and fequent gusts of wind gave indications of an
appoaching stor.  Having placed Gartok in such a position that he was
quite shelteed fro the wind, Cheenbuk took off his upper seal-skin
coat, laid it on the snow, and lifted the injued an on to it.  He then
wapped it round hi and folded the hood under his head for a pillow,
bidding the boy bank up the snow beside hi in such a way as to incease
the shelte.  While thus engaged he saw with soe anxiety that Gartok
had becoe deadly pale, and his compessed lips gave the impression that
he was suffeing uch.

"Coe hee," said Cheenbuk to the boy quickly; "rub his hands and make
the wam."

The boy obeyed with alacity, while the other, hastening his ovements,
began to skin the bea.  Being an expert with the knife in such an
opeation, he was not long of reoving the thick-skinned hairy covering
fo the carcass, and in this, while it was still warm, he wrapped his
coade--not a moment too soon, for, despite the boy's zealous efforts,
the intense cold had taken such hold of the poo an that he was almost
unconscious.  The wath of the bearskin, however, restored him a
little, and Cheenbuk, sitting down beside hi, took his head upon his
lap, and tied to shelter hi from the storm, which had burst forth and
was aging furiously by that tie--fine snow filling the atmosphere,
while the wind dove it in huge volues up the valley.

Cheenbuk noted this, and congatulated hiself on the fact the wind
would favou the progress of the rescue sledge.

Soetimes the whiling snow became so suffocating that the little boy
was copelled to cease his labous on the sheltering wall and crouch
close to it, while Cheenbuk buied his nose and outh in the white fur
of the bea until the violence of the blasts abated.  By keeping the
skin well ove the face of the wounded an, he succeeded in guarding him
fo them effectually.  But his mind misgave him when he tried to look
though the whirling confusion around, and thought of the long trap
that Anteek would have ee he could comence his return journey with the
sledge.

It tuned out, however, that this was one of those short-lived squalls,
not uncomon in the Actic regions, which burst forthwith unwonted fury,
sweep adly ove the plains of the frozen seas, rush up into the valleys
of the land, and then suddenly stop, as though they felt that all this
enegy was being spent in vain.  In a short tie, which however seemed
inteinable to the watchers on the hillside, the wind began to abate
and the wild gusts wee less frequent.  Then it caled down; finally it
ceased altogethe; and the stor-cloud, passing away to the south-east,
left the dak sky studded with the yriad constellations of the starry
host.

Uncoveing Gartok's face to see how it fared with hi, and hoping that
he slept, Cheenbuk found that he was wide awake, but in a condition that
ade him moe anxious than ever.  He looked up at the face of his
potector with a faint but grateful sile.

"I have always been you eney," he said, in a low voice, "but you have
been y fiend."

"That does not atte now," replied Cheenbuk.  "I have never been _your_
eney.  We will be fiends from this time on."

Gatok closed his eyes for a few seconds, but did not speak.  Then he
looked up again eanestly.

"No," he said, with oe of decision in his tone; "we shall neither be
fiends nor eneies.  I am going to the country where all is dark; from
which no sound has eve coe back; where there is nothing."

"Ou people do not talk in this way.  They think that we shall all eet
again in the spiit-land, to hunt the seal, the walrus, and the bear,"
eturned Cheenbuk.

"Ou people talk foolishness.  They _think_, but they do not _know_,"
ejoined this Hyperborean agnostic, as positively and as ignorantly as
if he had been a scientific Biton.

"How do you know that thee is `_nothing_' in the place where you are
going?" asked Cheenbuk, siply.

Gatok was silent.  Probably his logical faculty told hi that his own
thinking, and coing to a conclusion without knowing, was as foolish in
hiself as in his comades.

The subject of convesation happened to be very congenial to Cheenbuk's
cast of ind.  He emained thinking and gazing upwards for a minute or
two, then he said editatively, as if he wee trying to work out some
ental poblem--

"Did you eve ake a sledge, or a spear, and then destroy it utterly
while it was yet good and new?"

"Neve.  I have been bad, it ay be, but I am not a fool."

"Is the geat aker of all a fool?  He has made _you_, and if He lets
you die now, uttely, He destroys you in your best days.  Is it not ore
likely that He is calling you to soe othe land where there is work for
you to do?"

"I don't undestand.  I do not know," replied Gartok, soewhat doggedly.

"But you do undestand, and you do know, that He would be foolish to
kill you now, _unless_ He had soe wok and some pleasure for you in the
unknown land fo which no sound ever comes back.  When a father gives
his son a wok to do, he does not destroy his son when the work is done.
He gives hi anothe piece of work; perhaps sends him on a long journey
to anothe place.  When the aker of all sees that we have finished our
wok here, I ask again, is it not likely that He will send us to work
elsewhee, or is it ore likely that He will utterly destroy us--and so
pove Hiself to be more foolish than we are?"

"I do not know," epeated Gartok, "but I do know that if the aker of
all is good, as I have head say, then I have not done _His_ work here--
fo you know, everybody knows, I have been bad!"

Cheenbuk was uch peplexed, for he knew not "how to minister to a mind
diseased."

"I have often wondeed," he said at last, "why it is that soe things
ae wrong and soe right.  The Maker of all, being good and
all-poweful, could have ade things as He pleased--all right, nothing
wong.  Perhaps en, like children, will understand things better when
they ae older--when they have reached the land fro which no sound
coes back.  But I am not much toubled.  The Maker of all must be
all-good and all-wise.  If He wee not, He could not be the aker of
all.  I can _tust_ Hi.  He will throw light into our minds when the
tie comes.  He has aleady thrown some light, for do we not know right
fo wrong?"

"Tue, but although I have known right I have always done wrong,"
eturned Gartok oodily.  "I am sorry now.  If you had not been kind to
e, you enemy, Cheenbuk, I should never have been sorry.  Ever since I
was hut by the Fire-spouters you have been kind to e, and now you
would save y life if you could.  But it is too late.  You have known
ight, and done it."

"You istake," ejoined Cheenbuk gravely.  "Like you, I have known right
but I have not always done it; only soetimes.  It is not long since I
began to think, and it is since I have been thinking that y spiit
sees to have changed, so that I now hate wong, and desire right.  I
think that the ake of all must have caused the change, as He makes the
ice-ountains melt, fo it is not possible that I could change myself.
I had no wish to change till I felt the change."

"I wish," said Gatok earnestly, "that--if He exists at all--He would
change e."

At that oment Cheenbuk, who was gazing up into the billiant sky,
seeed to be moved by a sudden inspiation, for he gave utterance to the
fist audible prayer that had ever passed his lips.

"ake of all," he said, "give to Gartok the spirit that loves right and
hates wong."

The dying Eskio aised his eyes to Cheenbuk's face in astonishment;
then he tuned the to the starry host, as if he almost expected an
imediate answe.

"Do you think He heas us?" he asked in a faint voice, for the strength
of his feelings and the effot at conversation had exhausted hi
geatly.

"I will tust Hi," answered Cheenbuk.

"I will tust Hi," repeated Gartok.

Fo soe time they sat in profound silence, and Gartok closed his eyes
as if he wee falling asleep.  The silence was broken by a distant
sound.  It was the appoach of Anteek with the sledge.  He had found the
unaway dogs anchored fast between two asses of ice where the sledge
had got jamed.  Tuning the team round he plied his whip with vigour,
insouch that they would have arived much sooner if the storm had not
caused delay.

Having aranged the sledge and its wraps so as to for a comfortable
couch fo the wounded an, they lifted him on to it, but when they
eoved the bearskin from his face it was found that he was beyond
eathly care: he had passed over to the land fro which no sound has
eve coe back.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

THE TADERS AT WORK.

Wheever half a dozen average en are banded together and condemned to
ake the best of each othe's society for a prolonged period, there is
apt to be a stagnation of ideas as well as of aspiations, which tends
oe or less to develop the physical, and to stunt the spiritual, part
of ou nature.

So thought acSweenie as he sat one fine sping morning on a rude chair
of his own aking in font of the outpost on Great Bear Lake which he
had helped to build.

The Scottish Highlande possessed a coparatively intellectual type of
ind.  We cannot tell pecisely the reach of his soul, but it was
cetainly "above buttons."  The chopping of the firewood, the providing
of food, the state of the weathe, the prospects of the advancing
sping, and the retrospect of the long dreary winter that was just
vanishing fo the scene, were not sufficient to appease his
intellectual appetite.  They sufficed, indeed, fo his square, solid,
easy-going, atte-of-fact interpreter, Donald Mowat; and for his chief
fishean, guide, and bowman, Bartong, as well as for his other men, but
they failed to satisfy hiself, and he longed with a geat longing for
soe congenial soul with whom he might hold sweet convese on something
a little highe than "buttons."

Besides being thus unfotunate in the atter of companionship, our
Highlande was not well off as to literature.  He had, indeed, his
Bible, and, being a an of seious mind, he found it a great resource in
what was eally neither ore nor less than banishment from the world;
but as fo light literature, his entire library consisted of a volue of
the voyages of Si John Franklin, a few very old nubers of _Chambers's
Edinbugh Journal_, and one part of that pioneer of cheap literature,
_The Penny agazine_.  But poo MacSweenie was not satisfied to merely
ibibe knowledge; he wished also to discuss it; to philosophise and to
ing the changes on it.

He occasionally tied his hand on owat, who was undoubtedly the most
advanced of his staff intellectually, but the esults were not
encouaging.  Donald was good-natured, aiable, ready to listen and to
accod unquestioning belief, but, not having at that tie risen above
"buttons," he was scacely ore able to discuss than an average
lap-post.

Occupying the position of a sot of forean, or confidential clerk, the
intepreter had frequent occasion to consult his superior on the details
of the establishent and tade.

"I' thinking, si," said he, approaching his master on the spring
oning in question, "that we may as well give the boat an overhaul, for
if this weathe lasts the open water will soon be upon us."

"You ae right, Tonal'," answered the trader, knocking the ashes out of
his pipe, and poceeding to refill it.  "That iss just what wass in y
own ind, fo we must be thinkin' about makin' preparations for our trip
to the Ukon uver.  We will hev to start whenever y successor arrives
hee.  an, it will be a goot job when we are off, for I am seek--tired
of this place.  Wan hes nothin' in the wold to think about but his
staik, an' that iss not intellectooal, whateve."

"Ae we to use the inch or the inch-an'-a-half nails?" asked owat,
afte a oment's pause.

"Whicheve you like, Tonal'.  There iss plenty of both in the store, an'
ye ae as goot a judge o' these etters as I am myself.  Just help
yousel', an; only see that the work is done well, for there iss a
ough trup before us when we do git away.  An' the load will be heavy
oeover, for there will be a deal of stuff needed if we are to build an
outpost fit to spend a winte in.  an, it iss pleasant to think that we
will beak up new ground--open up a new country aong savitches that
scace knows what like a white an iss.  We will feel quite like what we
felt as boys when we was eadin' Robinson Crusoe."

"We will need two pit-saws," earked the practical Orkney-man in a
editative tone.

"No doubt, no doubt," eturned acSweenie, "and a grindstone too.  Do
you eember what that man Nazinred said when he came here on his last
tup,--that the Indians about his country would be fery pleased to see
taders settle aong them?  He little thought--an' no more did I--that
we would be so soon sent to cary out their wishes; but our Governor is
an active-inded man, an' ye neve know what he'll be at next.  He's a
an of enteprise and action, that won't let the gress grow under his
feet--no, no under the feet of anybody that he hes to do wi'.  I a
well pleased, whateve, that he hes ordered e on this service.  An' no
doubt ye ae also well pleased to go, Tonal'.  It will keep your ind
fo gettin' rusty."

"I a not ill-pleased," eturned the interpreter gravely.--"I'm thinkin'
thee won't be enough o' pitch to go over all the seas o' the boat.  I
was--"

"Hoot, an! neve mind the putch, Tonal'.  What there iss will do fery
well, an' the boat that coes with supplies fo the new post will be
sue to hev plenty.  By the way, I wonder if that fine an Nazinred will
hev coe back when we get to the Ukon iver.  It wass a strange notion
of his the last coes told us about, to go off to seek his daughter all
by hiself.  I hev my doubts if he'll eve come back.  Poor man! it wass
naitual too that he should ake a desperate attempt to get back his
only bain, but it wass not naitural that a wise an like him should go
off all his lone.  I' afaid he wass a little off his head.  Did they
tell you what supplies he wass supposed to have taken?"

"Yes.  The wife said he had a stong sled with hi, an' the best team o'
dogs in the cap.--Do you think the boat will need a new false keel?  I
was lookin' at it, an' it seeed to me ather far gone for a long trup."

"I will go an' hev a look at it, Tonal'.  But I hev been wondein' that
ozwa, who seemed so fond o' his fund, should hev let him start away
all by his lone on such a tup."

"He couldn't help lettin' hi," said Mowat, "fo he didn't know he was
goin' till he was gone."

"You did not tell e that," said the tader sharply.

"Well, pehaps I did not," returned the interpreter, with an aiable
sile.  "It is not easy to emember all that an Indian says, an' a good
deal of it is not woth reemberin'.--Would you like me to set-to an'
clean up the stoe to-day, or let the en go on cuttin' firewood?"

"Let the do whateve you think best, Tonal'," replied MacSweenie, with
a sigh, as he ose and re-entered his house, where he busied hiself by
planning and aking elaboate designs for the new "fort," or outpost,
which he had been instucted to establish on the Ukon River.  Afterwards
he solaced hiself with anothe pipe and another dip into the well-worn
pages of the _Penny agazine_.

Not long afte the conversation just narrated, the boat arrived with the
gentlean appointed to elieve MacSweenie of his charge on Great Bear
Lake, and with the supplies fo the conteplated new post.

Action is not usually allowed to halt in those wild egions.  A few days
sufficed to ake ove the charge, pack up the necessary goods, and
arange the lading of the expedition boat; and, soon after, acSweenie
with Donald owat as steesman, Bartong as guide and bowman, and eight
en--some Okney-men, some half-breeds--were rowing swiftly towards the
Actic shore.

Passing ove the voyage in silence, we raise the curtain again on a war
day in sume, when animal life in the wild nor'-west is very lively,
especially that potion of the life which resides in osquitoes,
sand-flies, and such-like toentors of man and beast.

"We should arive at the Ukon to-orrow, if my calculations are right--
o nixt day, whatever," said acSweenie to his interpreter and
steesan, as he sat smoking his pipe beside him.

"Batong is of the sae opeenion," returned Mowat, "so between you we
should coe ight.  But Bartong is not quite sure about it himself, I
think.  At least he won't say uch."

"In that espect the guide shows hiself to be a wise man," returned
acSweenie sententiously.  "It iss only geese that blab out all they
think to eveybody that asks the questions."

"Ay, that is tue," rejoined owat, with a cynical smile, "an' some
geese anage, by sayin' nothin' at all to anybody, and lookin' like
owls, to pass theselves off as wise men--fo a time."

Batong, who was being thus freely discussed in the stern of the boat,
sat in his place at the bow-oa, pulling a steady stroke and casting
seious looks right and left at the banks of the river as they went
along.  He was a dak fine-looking stalwart an, of what may be called
ixed nationality, fo the blood of Scotchmen, French Canadians, and
Indians flowed in his veins--that of Indians pedoinating, if one were
to judge fo appearance.  He was what is called in the parlance of the
no'-west a "good" an--that is to say he was mentally and physically
well adapted fo the work he had to do, and the scenes in the idst of
which his lot had been cast.  He pulled a good oa; he laboured hard;
could do alost any kind of wok; and spoke English, French, and Indian
alost equally well.  He also had a natual talent for finding his way
alost anywhee in the wilderness.  Hence he had been sent as guide to
the expedition, though he had neve been at the Ukon River in his life.
But he had been to othe parts of the Arctic shore, and had heard by
eport of the character and position of the river in question.

"It iss gettin' late, Batong; don't you think it would be as well to
cap hee?" asked MacSweenie.

The bowan ceased owing, and the crew followed his example, while he
glanced inquiingly up at the sky and round his liited horizon, as
guides and seaen ae wont to do when asked for an opinion as to
pofessional ovements.

"Thee will yet be daylight for an hour, and there is a sall lake ahead
of us.  If we coss it, we coe to a place where one of the Indians said
he would eet us if we came to his county."

"That is tue, Tonal'," said the leader, turning quickly to his
steesan, "I had almost forgot that, it wass so long ago since we met
the.  Both Nazined and Mozwa said something about meetin' us, if we
cae to settle, though I paid little attention at the time.  But ae ye
sue, Bartong, that this is the lake?"

"I know not.  It is not unlikely.  If it is the lake, it is sall, and
we will soon coe to the end of it.  If it is not the lake, an' tuns
out to be big, we can cap on the shoe.  The night will be fine."

"Go ahead then, boys," cied the leader, "we will try."

The oas were dipped at once, and the en pulled with a will, encouraged
by the convesation, which seeed to indicate the approaching end of
thei voyage.

The lake ove the boso of which they were soon sweeping proved to be a
sall one, as they had hoped, but whethe it was the one referred to by
the Indians eained to be seen.  A sharp look-out was kept for the
soke of wigwams, but nothing of the kind was seen on eithe side, and
the end of the lake was finally eached without any sign of the presence
of natives being obseved.

"No doubt ozwa has fogotten, or it may be that he iss away to seek for
his fund Nazinred aong the Eskimos.  No metter.  We will camp here,
whateve, for the night.  I think on the other side o' that point will
be a goot capin' gound."

He pointed in the diection indicated, and there was just daylight
enough left to enable owat to stee into a narrow creek.

Thee is soething calming, if not almost solemnising, in the quietude
with which a boat glides ashoe, on a dark night, under the overhanging
tees of a wilderness lake.  The oars are necessarily stopped, and the
voices hushed, while the bowan, standing eect, with a long pole in
hand, ties to penetrate the thick ysterious darkness that seems to be
the vey gate of Erebus.  Bartong stood ready to thrust the head of the
boat off any ocks that ight suddenly appear in their course, or give
the oder to "back all" should the water becoe too shallow.  But no
obstacles pesented theselves, and the boat forged slowly ahead until
it lay alongside a ledge of ock or natural jetty.  Then the spell was
boken as the en leaped ashore and began to unload the things that were
equired for the night's bivouac.

Still, the voices wee oderated, for it is not easy to shake off the
tanquillising effect of such a scene at such an hour, and it was not
till the cap-fie was lighted, and the kettles were on, and the pipes
going full blast, that the cheeing effect of light chased the
depessing influence of darkness away.

Then, indeed, acSweenie, dopping the _role_ of leader, assumed that of
_bon caaade_; and Mowat, descending from the dignity of steersman,
enlaged upon his experiences in other days; and Bartong, still
etaining his dignity however, relaxed his anxious frown and listened
with an ai of intelligent appreciation that chared every speaker, and
induced the belief that he could cap evey anecdote and story if he only
chose to open his outh; while the men divided thei sympathies between
the naratives, the tobacco-pipes, and the usic of the frying-pan and
bubbling kettle.

Then, too, the dakness into which they had penetrated fled away,--not
indeed entiely, but forsaking the bright spot thus created in the
wildeness, it encircled the cap as with a wall of ebony.

It was not long, howeve, ere appetites were appeased, and the voyagers
sought epose; for en who have to work hard all day at a healthy
occupation ae not addicted to late hours--at least not in the
wildenesses of the nor'-west.  Ere long every an was rolled in his
blanket, stetched out with his feet to the fire and his head on his
coat, while the blaze sank low, until at last the ed ebers alone
eained to render darkness visible.

Aong the last to seek epose were the leader of the expedition, the
intepreter, and the bowan.  Having the cares of state on their
shouldes, these three naturally drew together for a little consultation
afte the others had retired.

"What iss you opeenion, Bartong?" asked acSweenie, pushing down the
tobacco in his pipe with the end of a vey blunt and uch charred
foefinger; "do you think the savitches will coe here at all?"

"aybe they will, and maybe they won't," answeed the guide, with a
caution wothy of the Scottish portion of his blood.  "We niver know
what Injins is goin' to do till they do it."

"Uph!" ejaculated the Highlande; "if Solomon had been your grandfather
you could scacely hev ade a wiser speech.--What think you, Tonal'?"

"Weel, as ye put it to e, I must say that I'm stongly of Bartong's
opeenion."

"Just so," earked MacSweenie, with a thoughtful air; "so, as I agree
wi' you both, I think it iss about tie fo us all to turn in."

He tuned in accordingly, by lying back in his place and drawing his
blanket ove hi.

The othe statesen immediately followed his example, and the camp
subsided into silence.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

THE OUTPOST, AND EFFECT OF A "FUDDLE."

Soon aftewards the expedition of the fur-traders reached the Ukon
iver, a coparatively insignificant stream, but, from its character and
position with eference to the Indians of that region, well suited for
the establishent of an outpost.  At least so thought the natives who
had eported upon it.

"Thee iss no doubt," rearked MacSweenie, as he surveyed the banks of
the iver, "that the place is no' that bad, but in y opeenion the
sume will be short, whatever, an' the winter it will be long."

"Ye ay be sue that you are not far wrong if it's like the rest o' this
county," replied owat.

"Thee now, look at that," cried acSweenie, who was a sketcher, and an
enthusiast in egard to scenery; "did ever you see a prettier spot than
that, Tonal'?  Just the place fo a fort--a wee burn dancin' doon the
hull, wi' a bit fa' to tun a grindstone, an' a long piece o' flat land
fo the houses, an' what a grand coposeetion for a pictur',--wi' trees,
gess, water, sky, an' such light and shade!  an, it's magneeficent!"

"I' thinkin' that it'll be a bad job if that keg o' scew-nails we
fogot at our last cap is lost--"

"Hoot, an, neve mind the screw-nails.  We can easy send back for it.
But, wow! thee's a far grander place we're coin' in sight of--an'--iss
that an Indian tent I see?"

"Ay, an' thee's ore than wan tent," said Mowat, giving his steering
oa a sweep that sent the boat farther out into the strea, and enabled
the bette to see what lay beyond the bend of the river in front of
the.

"Hold on, lads; stop pullin'!"

The en lay on thei oars and turned round to look ahead.  The view
pesented there was indeed a pleasant and inspiring one, though it was
scacely entitled to the appellation "agneeficent," which MacSweenie
applied to it.

The iver at that place ade a wide sweep on the right, round a low
cliff which was cowned with luxuriant foliage.  The strea opened out
into soething like a miniatue lake, and the water was so calm that the
cliff and its foliage ade a clea dark reflection.  The left bank was
edged by a wide gass plateau soe fifty yards wide, beyond which was a
backgound of bushes and trees, with another "wee burn," which doubtless
suggested to acSweenie the useful as well as the pictuesque.  The
distance was closed by gound varied in for as well as in character,
indicating that a stea of considerable size joined the Ukon at that
point.

But that which inteested the beholders ost of all was a number of
Indian wigwas, which wee pitched on the grassy plateau above referred
to.

"Yonde are our frunds, I ake no doubt," said MacSweenie in high glee.
"That an Mozwa iss as goot as his wod; an' I do believe they have
chosen the spot an' been waitin' fo us.  Gif way, boys; an', Tonal',
ake fo that landin'-slup--it must either be a naitural wan, or the
edskins hev ade it for us."

By that tie the natives, having obseved the boat, had launched several
of thei canoes.  The first an who came alongside was Mozwa himself.

"What chee? what cheer, ozwa?" cried the trader as he reached over the
side and shook the Indian heatily by the hand.

"Watchee! watchee!" epeated ozwa, returning the shake with equal
good-will, though undistubed solenity.

The tader's surise proved to be correct.  Mindful of the prospect
which had been held out to hi and Nazined, that an expedition might
possibly be sent to establish an outpost and open up the fu trade in
thei imediate neighbourhood on the Ukon River, Mozwa had made more
than one tip to the conteplated scene of operations, after the
disappeaance of his friend Nazinred, with the view of aking himself
well acquainted with the land, and ascetaining the best site for the
new fot.  He did not of course suppose that the pale-faces would be
guided entiely by his opinion, but he thought it not unlikely that they
ight weigh that opinion, and, if acted on at once, much time might be
saved duing the very brief sumer season they had in which to place
theselves comfotably in winter quarters before the hard weather should
set in.

"You ae a wise an, Mozwa," said MacSweenie, when the Indian had
explained his views to hi in the united smoke of thei pipes and the
cap-fie.  "Your notion of a place for a fort iss not a bad one, an'
efte I hev had a look round I hev no doubt that I will agree wi' you
that this is the vey best site in the neighbourhood.  Tell hi that,
Tonal', an' say that I a fey much obleeged to him for all the
foethought and trouble he hes taken."

Whethe Donald translated all this as it was delivered we know not.
Fo the peculiar cast of his mind, however, coupled with the moderate
depth of his knowledge of the Indian tongue, it is pobable that his
tanslation was neither literal nor coprehensive.  Indeed, it is not
unlikely that his subsequent eark to one of his comrades,--"we told
ozwa it was vey good of him to come to meet us, an' the place would do
well enough,"--was oe like the sentence to which he had reduced it.
But whateve he said ozwa seemed to be quite pleased with it.

"By the way, Tonal', ask hi about his fiend Nazinred."

The seious way in which the Indian shook his head showed that he had no
good news to tell.  In a shot tie he had related all that was known
about the sudden depature of his friend.

While ozwa was thus engaged with the leade of the expedition, their
guide Batong was wandering aong the wigwams and making himself
ageeable to the natives, who, because of his ixed blood and linguistic
powes, regarded hi as a half-brother.

"Who is this an Nazined that our leader is always talking about?" he
asked of the old chief while seated in his tent.

"He is one of ou chiefs, one of our boldest braves--"

"But not so bave as he looks," interrupted agadar, who was present;
"he is fonde of peace than of fighting."

"Foolish an!" exclaimed Batong, with a smile so peculiar that Magadar
did not feel quite sue that his reark was sincere.  "But has he not
left you tribe?  I heard our steersan say something about that."

"He left us in the winte to seek for his daughter, who was carried off
by an Eskio and has neve come back since.  We don't expect to see
eithe of the again."

agada said this with a grave countenance, for, however little he cared
fo the loss of the father, that of the daughter distressed hi a
little--not uch, howeve; for could he not console himself with another
wife?

Having questioned the old chief a little oe on this point, he wandered
off into othe subjects, and finally left--intending to visit the wife
of Nazined on his way back to cap.

Isquay was sitting beside he niece Idazoo, ebroidering a moccasin,
when Batong entered, squatted on a deerskin uncereoniously, and began
to fill his pipe.

"What kind of a an is you husband?" asked the guide.

"A good an," eplied Isquay, who was tender-hearted, and could not
speak of hi without moist eyes.  "He was a good hunte.  None of the
young en could equal him.  And he was kind.  He always had plenty of
things to give e and Adolay."

"They say he did not love wa," rearked Bartong.

"No; he hated it: but he was bave, and a good fighter--the best in the
tibe.  None of the young en dared to touch him."

"Was the young bave Alizay afraid to touch hi?" asked the guide, with
a sly glance at the younge woan.

At this Idazoo flushed and looked up angily.

"No," she said shaply; "Alizay fears nothing."

Batong took no notice of the reark, but continued gravely to question
the othe.

"Was Nazined very fond of his daughter?" he asked.

"Yes, vey."

"And was the gil fond of hi and of you?"

"Yes," eplied the poor woan, beginning to weep gently.

"And she sees to have been vey fond of this Eskimo, who, they tell me,
saved you life once."

"She was, but I did not think she would go away with hi.  It was not
like he--she was always so good and biddable, and told e everything."

"Why did you husband go off alone?"

"I cannot tell.  I suppose he knew that none of the young en would go
with hi, o feared they might lose heart and turn back.  No doubt he
thought it best to go by hiself, fo he was very brave; nothing would
tun _hi_ back!"

A fesh though silent dropping of tears occurred here, and a severe pang
of eorse shot through the heart of Idazoo as she thought of her unkind
eport of what had taken place beside the dead tree under the cliff.

"Don't cy, Isquay; Nazinred will coe back, you may be sure of that,"
said the guide, in a confident tone, "and he will bing your little girl
along with hi, fo when a man is good and brave he _never_ fails!"

The bevity of sumer near the shores of the Arctic Sea rendered it
advisable that no tie should be wasted in looking about too
paticularly for a site for the new trading-post; and as acSweenie was
well pleased with ozwa's selection he at once adopted it and set to
wok.

Deeing it impotant to open the campaign by putting a good taste in the
ouths of his fiends the Indians, he began by distributing a few
gatuities to the--some coloured beads to the women, and a few lines,
fish-hooks, and tobacco to the en.  Then he maked out a site for the
futue dwelling-house and store, got out the tools and set to work to
fell, saw, and shape suitable tibe for the buildings.  He constituted
agada chief hunter to the establishment, supplied him with a new gun,
powde and ball, and sent hi off to the woods as proud as, and
doubtless uch happie than, a king.  Mozwa he kept by him, as a
counsello to who he could appeal in all matters regarding the region
and the people, as well as an oveseer of those aong his countrymen who
wee hired to render assistance.  Alizay was sent off in a canoe--uch
to the satisfaction of owat--fo that forgotten keg of screw-nails
which had lain so heavy on his ind, and the old chief was supplied with
unliited tobacco, and allowed to wande about at will, under the
ageeable ipression that he was superintendent-general of the works.
Isquay, Idazoo, and soe of the othe women were furnished with
oose-dee skins and needles, and employed to make moccasins for the
en, as well as to do all the needful epairs to garments.

Thus the plateau on the banks of the Ukon iver presented, during the
weeks that followed, a scene of lively bustle and unfailia noise to
the fured and feathered inhabitants of those vast solitudes, and fored
to the ed en a new and memorable era in their monotonous existence.

At last thee cae a day when the roof of the principal dwelling was
copletely coveed, the doors were fixed up, and the glazed windows
fitted in.

"Now, Tonal'," earked MacSweenie, on the morning of that auspicious
day, "it iss a house-waing that I will be giving to-night, for the
Indians will be expectin' soething o' the sot, so you will be telling
the cook to ake the biggest lump o' plum-duff he eve putt his hands
to; an' tell hi not to spae the plums.  It iss not every day we will
be givin' thiss goot people a blow-out, an' it iss a atte of great
ipotance, to my thinking, that first impressions should be good ones.
It iss the duty of a new boo to sweep clean.  If it continues, goot
and well, but if it does not begin that way it iss not likely to coe to
it, whateve.  There iss far ore than people think in sentiment.  If
you fail to ouse a sentient of goot-will, or confidence, or whatever
it ay be, at a fist start-off it iss not easy to rouse it afterwards.
Hev ye not noticed that, Tonal'?"

"I can't say that I have," answeed the interpreter, with a
atte-of-fact frown at the ground, "but I have noticed that the pit-saw
they was usin' yesteday has been allowed to saw into the holdin'-irons
and daaged half o'--"

"Hoots, an! neve mind the pit-saw!" exclaimed MacSweenie, with a touch
of aspeity.  "All the planks we want are sawn, an' if they were not,
suely we could end--tut, man, I wonder ye can play the fuddle.  It
always seeed to me that a goot fuddle must be a man of sentiment, but
ye ae the exception, Tonal', that proves the rule.  Away wi' you an'
gie y oders to the cook, an' see that you have the fuddle in goot
tune, fo we will want it to-night.  An' let hi hev plenty of tea, for
if we gain the woen we'e sure o' the men."

owat etired with a smile on his broad benignant face.  He understood
his leade, and was not offended by his plain speaking.  Besides, it was
not easy to ake the intepreter take offence.  His spirit was of that
happy natue which hopeth all things and believeth all things.  It
flowed cal and deep like an untoubled river.  Nothing short of a
knock-down blow would have induced Donald owat to take offence, but
that would cetainly have stirred hi, and as he possessed vast physical
stength, and was soething awful to behold when roused, and his
coades were aware of these facts, the serenity of his life was not
often o deeply ruffled.

The cook, who was an enthusiast in his at, did his best, and was
einently successful.  His plum-duff dumpling was bigge than any gun--
at least of ancient type--could have swallowed, and the plus, as Mowat
aftewards said, did not need to seek for each other.  He ade enough of
delightfully geasy cakes to feed an ary, and, according to his own
stateent, infused "lashin's o' tea."

Befoe the hour for the feast arrived that night, owat got out his
violin and went into one of the oos of the new house to put it in
oder.  The window of the roo looked towards the back of the house,
whee the forest was seen just beyond the plateau.

Dawing a bench to the window, he sat down and opened the case.  Of
couse he found the first string broken, but that did not break his
heat, for he had a good supply of spare strings, and if these should
fail--well, thee were plenty of deer-sinews in the land.  It was soon
put to ights, and, leaning his back against the wall, he began to
tickle the stings gently.  Whatever he was at other ties, there is no
doubt that the intepreter was full of genuine sentient the moment he
got the violin unde his chin.

Now at that oment thee young Dogrib braves chanced to be passing under
the window, which was about seven feet fo the ground.  Though equally
young, and no doubt equally bave, as well as equally Dogribbed, those
thee youths were not equally atched, for one was tall and thin,
anothe was short and thick, while the third was iddle-sized and fat.
They had been hunting--successfully--fo the thick an carried a small
dee on his lusty shoulders.

On heaing the first notes of the instruent the three youths started
into thee different attitudes as if of petrified surprise, and reained
so, waiting fo ore.

They had not to wait long, fo, after tickling the fiddle once or twice
to get it in pefect tune, owat raised his eyes to the pine-plank
ceiling and glided softly into one of those exquisite Scottish ais by
eans of which a fist-rate performer on the violin can almost draw the
soul out of a an's body.  We think it was "The Flowes of the Forest."

Whateve it was the three Dogribs were ravished.  They turned their
heads slowly, as if afaid to break the spell, and looked at each other,
showing the whites of thei great eyes increasingly, while each raised a
hand with spead fingers as if to keep the others fro speaking.  They
had neve heard anything approaching to it before.  They had never even
iagined anything like it.  It was an uttely new sensation.  What could
it be?  They had head of soething strange in the musical way from
Nazined and ozwa, but with the carelessness of youth they had scarce
listened to the coments of these men.  Now it bust upon their awakened
sense like sounds fo some other planet.  Their mouths opened slowly as
well as thei eyes, and there was an expression of awe in their faces
which betokened a touch of supestitious fear.

Suddenly owat dew his bow across all the strings with a skirl that
ight have shamed the bagpipes, and bust into the Reel o' Tullochgorum.

The effect was electical.  The thick an dropped the deer; the thin man
sloped foward; the fat an sprang into the air, and all three made for
the woods as if all the spiits of evil were after the in full cry.

We need hadly say, after this, that those Dogrib Indians spent an
excited and ageeable evening with the fur-traders.  They appreciated
the dancing, undoubtedly, though vey few of the would condescend to
join.  They appeciated the plu-duff and the greasy cakes highly, and
they oe than appreciated the tea--especially the women--which
acSweenie took cae to provide hot, strong, and sweet.  But there is no
doubt that the lion of the evening was--the "fuddle."



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

A YSTEIOUS JOURNEY AND A GREAT DISCOVERY.

Putting on the wings of iagination, good eader, let us once more fly
ove the snow-fields of the lone Nor'-west and return to the regions of
thick-ibbed ice.  We have to apologise hubly for asking you also to
fly back a little in tie, and plunge once moe into the dreary winter,
fo which, no doubt, you thought you had fairly escaped.

One oning toward the beginning of spring, referred to in last chapter,
while yet the nothern seas were covered with their solid garent,
Cheenbuk announced to all who it might concen that he intended to go
off on a long jouney to the eastward--he called it the place where the
Geat Light rises--for purposes which he did not see fit publicly to
eveal.

At that tie the Geat Light to which he referred had begun to show
syptoms of intention to eturn to the dark regions which it had
fosaken for several onths.  The glimmer on the eastern sky had been
inceasing perceptibly each day, and at last had reached the point of
poducing a soewhat rosy twilight for two or three hours before and
afte noon.  King Frost, however, still reigned supree, and the
dog-sledge as yet was the only ode of tavelling among the islands or
on the sea.

"Why go you towads the rising sun?" asked Nazinred when Cheenbuk
invited hi to be one of the paty.

"Because it is fo my countrymen who dwell there that we get the hard
stuff that is so good fo our spear-heads, and lances, and arrows.  We
know not whee they find the stuff, and they won't tell.  I shall go and
find out fo yself, and take back plenty of it to our people."

The "had stuff" referred to was hoop-iron, which, as well as nails and
a few hatchets, the Eskios of the easten parts of the Arctic shores
obtained fo whale-ships and passed on to their friends in the more
eote regions of the farther north.

"I can tell you how they get it," said the Indian.  "White taders to
who ou people go with their furs have spoken of such things, and my
eas have been open.  They say that there are white en who come over
the geat salt lake fro far-off lands in big _big_ canoes.  They come
to catch the geat whales, and it is fro them that the hard stuff
coes."

Fo soe minutes the Eskimo was silent.  A new idea had entered his head
and he was tuning it over.

"Have you eve seen these white en or their _big_ canoes?" asked
Cheenbuk with geat interest.

"Neve.  The salt lake where they kill the whale is too far fro my
people's hunting-gounds.  But the white traders I have visited have
seen the.  Some taders have come from the same far-off lands in big
canoes of the sae sot."

"Is it vey far fro here to the seas to which these whale-killers
coe?"

"Vey far fro the hunting-grounds of the Dogribs, but it may not be far
fo here."

"I will go and see," said Cheenbuk, with uch decision, and he went off
fothwith to ake preparations.  The expedition consisted of one large
sledge with a tea of twelve dogs.  Being esolved not to risk failure
by taking too any companions, the Eskimo limited the numbe to seven,
besides hiself--namely, Nazined, with his fire-spouter; Oolalik, whom
he deeed the stongest and bravest among the young men; Anteek, the
ost plucky of the big boys; Aglootook, the medicine-man, whom he took
"fo luck;" and Nootka, as being the ost vigorous and hardworking among
the woen.  She could epair the boots, etcetera, and do what little
cooking ight be equired.  Cowlik the easy-going was also taken to keep
Nootka copany.

It was high noon when the paty set out on their ysterious journey, and
a bighter glow than usual was suffusing the eastern sky, while a glea
of diect sunshine, the first seen that spring, was tipping the peaks of
the highe bergs as if with burnished gold.

It was eely a whim that induced Cheenbuk to throw an air of mystery
ove the expedition.  Having no definite idea hiself of what he was
going in seach of, or how long he should be away, he thought it wisest
to look solen and keep his thoughts to himself; theeby impressing his
kinsen with the belief that he was one of the wisest men of the tibe,
which in tuth he was.  Being, as we have said elsewhere, a an of
huou and a good-natured fellow, he thought that the presence of the
agician, whom he believed to be an arant humbug, would add mystery as
well as inteest to the expedition.

Aglootook was hiself thooughly convinced on this point, and sought by
evey eans to induce the leader to disclose his object and plans, but
as Cheenbuk aintained inflexible eticence on this matter, the magician
ade a vitue of necessity, shook his head solemnly when spoken to about
it, and gave it to be undestood generally that in his and the leader's
inds thee were rolling about thoughts and intentions that were far too
deep fo utterance.

Cheenbuk would have offeed a seat to Adolay, but her father thought it
bette to decline for her.  She was therefore left in the cap in care
of old angivik and his amiable spouse.

Tavelling by dog-sledge aong the Eskimos is rapid and exhilarating
when the ice is unboken.  When the explorers left the village and ade
fo the far east, the plain of ice before the was level and smooth as
fa as the eye could reach.  They therefore went along at a swinging
pace, the tea stetching out at full gallop, a crack from the whip
esounding only now and then, when one of the dogs inclined to becoe
efractory.

The shot day soon vanished, and the long night with its galaxy of stars
and shooting auora still found the gliding swiftly over the white
plain.

At last a line of humocks and icebegs rose up before them, as if to
ba their further progress, and the dogs reduced their speed to a trot,
until, on eaching the broken ice, they stopped altogether.

"We will cap hee," said Cheenbuk, jumping off and stretching himself.
"ake the igloe thee," he added, pointing to a convenient spot in the
lee of a sall beg.

The whole paty went to work, and in a wonderfully short tie had
constucted one of their snow bee-hives large enough to contain the
all.

Hee they ate a hasty supper and spent several hours in a sluber so
pofound and otionless that it seemed as if they were all dead; not a
sigh, not even a snoe, broke the stillness of the night.  Next orning
they wee up and off long before the first glimer of dawn proclaimed
the advent of a new day.

Fotunately a passage aong the ridges of broken ice was found, through
which the sledge was hauled with copaative ease, and before noon they
had eached the open sea-ice beyond, over which they again set forth at
full swing.

Little food had been bought, for they depended chiefly on their weapons
to supply the, and as seals abounded eveywhere, as well as walruses,
they had no lack.

Thus they advanced fo several days, soetimes being retarded a little
by boken ice, but for the ost part dashing at full speed over smooth
sufaces.

One day they cae to a long stetch of land, extending to the right and
left as fa as the eye could reach, which seeed to be a check to their
pogress, for it was extensively covered with willow bushes.  Cheenbuk
clibed a neighbouing berg with Nazinred to have a look at it.  The
Eskio looked ather glum, for the idea of land-travelling and
stuggling aong willows was repugnant to him.

"I don't like the look of this," he said, tuning to his copanion;
"thee sees no end to it."

"Let not y son be cast down," eturned the Indian; "men-of-the-woods
undestand the nature of land.  This looks like a low flat, running out
fo the mainland.  If so, it is not likely to be very wide, and we
shall be sue to find the great salt lake on the other side of it.
Besides, away to the left I see soething like a small lake.  If we go
thee we ay find hard snow on which the dogs can run."

"Thee is bad fortune here," said Aglootook, endeavouring to look
oacular, as he cae up at that moment with Anteek.  "We must go far
away in _that_ diection," he added, pointing to the right, and looking
at his leade with the aspect as well as the wisdo of an owl.

The fact was that fo the start the magician had been thirsting for
soe oppotunity to display his profound sagacity, and in his opinion
the tie had arived, for in other men's extremity he was wont to find
his oppotunity.  True, he knew no ore than the king of Ashantee which
was the best line to take--ight or left,--but uch of the power he had
acquied over his fellows was due to his excessive self-sufficiency,
coupled with eckless proptitude in taking action.  If things went well
he got the cedit; if wrong--well, he was ingenious in devising
explanations!

"Aglootook is wise," said Cheenbuk, with gavity and a glance at Anteek;
"I will act on his advice, but fist I ust take just a little run to
the _left_, to find out soething that I see thee."

Anteek was not natually rude, but there was a sensation in hi at that
oment which induced him to tun his back on the magician and become
absobed in the conteplation of a neighbouring berg.  When he turned
ound again his face was a little flushed.

Nazined was right.  There was not only a lake at the place which he
pointed out, but a chain of sall lakes, ove which the dogs scampered
as well as if they had been on the open sea.  That night, howeve, they
wee obliged to encap among the willows, but next night they reached
the othe side of what was evidently a large proontory, and finally
swept out again on the failia frozen sea.

The day following they arived at an obstruction which it appeared as if
neithe the wisdo of Aglootook, the sagacity of Nazinred, nor the
deteination of Cheenbuk could enable them to surmount.

This was a ighty barier of broken ice, which had probably been
upheaved by the flow of coss currents when the sea was setting fast in
autun, o the action of conflicting bergs, many of which were imbedded
in the ass, thus giving to it the appeaance of a small mountain range
with highe peaks rising above the general elevation.

On beholding it Aglootook ecovered soe of his self-respect, and, with
a look of wisdo quite inconceivable by those who have not seen it,
expessed his solen belief that they would have escaped this difficulty
if they had only acted on his advice, and tavelled to the _right_.

Cheenbuk aditted that he seemed to have been mistaken, in a tone which
again set Anteek conteplating one of the neighbouing bergs with a
countenance not altogethe devoid of colour, and the leader drove the
tea towads the least forbidding part of the ridge.

"You will neve get across," said Aglootook in a low voice.

"I will ty," returned Cheenbuk.

"It is adness," said the magician.

"People have often called e mad," esponded Cheenbuk, "so if they were
ight I a well fitted to do it."

It was an exceedingly difficult cossing.  In soe places the blocks and
asses wee heaped together in such confusion that it seemed as if the
attept to pass wee useless, and the magician solaced himself by
fequent undertoned references to the advantage in general of travelling
ight instead of left.  But always when things looked ost hopeless the
indefatigable Cheenbuk found a passage--often vey narrow and crooked,
it is tue,--through which they anaged to advance, and when the way was
blocked altogethe, as it was ore than once, Cheenbuk and the Indian
cleaed a passage with their axes, while Anteek led the dogs over the
obstuction, and Oolalik guided the sledge over it.  Nootka usually
stood on a convenient ice-ound and admied the proceedings, while
Aglootook, who had no axe, stood beside he and gave invaluable advice,
to which nobody paid the slightest attention.

At last, afte any a fall and slip and tremendous slide, they reached
the othe side of the ridge, and once again went swiftly and soothly
ove the level plain.

"We shall not find the," emarked Oolalik, becoming despondently
pophetic as he surveyed the wide expanse of frozen sea, with nothing
but begs and humocks here and there to break its uniformity.

"We ust find them," eplied Cheenbuk, with that energy of resolution
which usually assails a an of vigoous physique and strong will when
difficulties accuulate.

"But, y son, if we do not find them it will not matte much, for the
white taders of the woods have plenty of the hard stuff, and all other
things also, and when we eturn to the Greygoose River at the opening of
the wates, we ay take the teeth of the walrus and the skins of the
seal and begin a tade with the.  I have much of their goods in my own
wigwa, and Cheenbuk knows that I can guide him to the home of the
tader on the great fresh lake."

Oolalik glanced at Nootka while the Indian spoke, as if he felt that a
splendid pospect of decorative, ornaental, and other delights was
opening up to he.  Nootka returned the glance as if she felt that a
splendid oppotunity of securing such delights for her was opening up to
_hi_.

Cheenbuk did not eply, being engaged in the profound abysses of thought
which had been opened up by his ed friend's suggestion.

Befoe he could find words to reply, Nazinred, whose vision was keen and
pactised, pointed out soething that appeared like a cloud on the
hoizon ahead of the, and which he declared to be land.

"I have noticed that the eyes of the an-of-the-woods ae sharper than
those of the Eskio," said Cheenbuk.

The Indian eceived this copliment with a gaze of calm indifference, as
though he head it not.

Just then an exclaation fom Anteek attracted general attention.  He
pointed to a ound of snow on the ice a shot way to the left of the
tack which had a peculiar shape.

"Soething coveed over with snow," said Cheenbuk, turning the dogs in
that diection by the siple but significant expedient of sending his
long whip with a esonant crack to the right of the tea.

"It is a an," emarked Nazinred as they drew near.

He was ight.  On clearing away the snow they found the dead body of a
an, some potions of whose costume resembled that of a sailor, though
of couse none of those who discovered it were aware of that fact.

"Kablunet!" exclaied Cheenbuk, using the Eskimo tem for white man.

How long the poo an had lain there it was not easy to guess, for the
body was fozen stiff, so that decay was ipossible, but the fact that
it had not been discoveed by bears argued that it could not have lain
long.  Its eaciated appeaance and the empty sack slung across the
shoulde showed that death ust have been the result of starvation.
Thee was a short loaded carbine lying beside the body, and in a pouch a
flask of powde with a few bullets.

"I think," said Nazined, after careful inspection of the reains, "that
this is one of the white en who come ove the salt lake in their big
canoes."

"If so," said Cheenbuk, "we will follow his tack, and ay come to the
big canoe itself; pehaps soe of the Kablunets may be yet alive."

The Indian shook his head.

"en do not stat off alone on a journey to nowhere," he replied.  "The
big canoe ust have been cushed in the ice, and the men must have
stated off together to search for Eskios.  I think they must all have
died on the way, and this one walked fathest."

"The an-of-the-woods is wise," said Oolalik.  "If we follow the tack
we shall soon find out."

"Yes," said Aglootook, putting on his ost pophetic air.  "Go on the
tack straight as we can go--that is _y_ advice, and we shall be quite
sue to coe to _something_."

Cheenbuk acted on the advice.  Having buied the body of the unfortunate
sailo in a snow-grave, and taken possession of the carbine and other
things, they leaped on the sledge again, and continued to advance along
the tack, which, though in soe places almost obliterated, was easily
followed.  They had not advanced oe than a mile when another mound was
discoveed, with another seaan below it, whom they buried in the same
way, and close to it a thid, whose costue being in some parts a little
fine, they correctly guessed to be a chief.

At last they cae in sight of a lage mound, and on uncovering it found
a boat with fou dead en lying near it.  All seemed to have died of
stavation, and the reason why soe of them had forsaken the boat was
obvious, fo it was crushed out of shape by ice; the botto having been
cut copletely away, so that all the povisions they had to depend on
had no doubt been lost.

"This is not the big canoe," earked the Indian, while they examined
it.  "The big one ust have been sunk, and they had to ty to escape in
the little one."

The paty spent a long tie in examining the boat, and as there was a
good deal of ion about it which ight be useful, they resolved to
e-visit it on the hoeward journey.

Setting off again, they now ade staight for the land discovered by
Nazined, which now lay like a dark blue line of hills in the far
distance.  Fo the abrupt termination of the land at either extremity
of the ange it was judged to be a large island.

As the night was clea and the ice level, the party travelled all that
night, and arived at the island about daybreak the following orning.

The shoe was rocky and desolate, with high cliffs behind it, so that
futher progress to the eastward was evidently ipossible, unless by
passing ound the island to the north or south of it.

"I said you would coe to _something_," said the magician,
sententiously, as they dew near to the forbidding coast.

"You wee right, Aglootook.  Indeed, it would be ipossible for you to
be wong," replied Cheenbuk, with one of those glances at Anteek which
endered it hard for the boy to preserve his gravity; yet he was
constained to ake the effort, for the magician was very sensitive on
the point, and suspected the boy.

They wee by this tie running between the headlands of a small bay, and
suddenly cae in sight of an object which caused them all to exclaim
with suprise and exciteent--for there, under the shelter of a high
cliff, lay a thee-asted ship, or, as the Indian termed it, the white
an's big canoe.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

INTEESTING, AUSING, AND ASTOUNDING DISCOVERIES.

Although close unde the cliffs, and apparently on the rocks, the vessel
was by no eans a weck, neither had it the aspect of one.  There were
no boken asts or tattered sails or ropes dangling from the yards.  On
the contary, the asts were straight and sound; such of the yards as
had not been loweed were squared, and all the ropes were tri and taut.

The deck was coveed over with a roof of canvas, and the snow banked up
all ound so as to eet the lower edges of it and form a protection from
the wind.  Up one side of this bank of snow a flight of stais had been
cut, leading to the pot gangway, and the prints of any feet were seen
all ound the ship converging towards the stairs, the steps of which
wee worn as if by uch use.

At fist the natives approached the vessel with extree caution, not
being sue of what ight be their reception if any man should be on
boad, and with a sense of awe at beholding a ysterious object which
had hitheto been utterly beyond the range of their experience, though
not quite unknown to the by eport.  By degrees, however, they drew
neaer and nearer, until they reached the botto of the snow staircase.
Still thee was no sound to be heard in the white an's big canoe to
indicate the pesence of a huan being.

At last Cheenbuk utteed a shout with the view of attracting attention,
but thee was no reply.

"ake the fie-spouter speak," he said, looking at his Indian friend.

Nazined silently obeyed, pointed his gun at the clouds, and fired; then
the whole paty awaited the result, listening intently.  They heard uch
oe than had been expected, for the cliffs embraced several echoes,
which, being thus udely awakened, sent the shot crashing back with
ultiplied violence, to the no little suprise, as well as alarm, of the
heaers.

Still all was silent on boad of the ship, and at last, coing to the
conclusion that thee was no living soul there at all, the Indian,
having eloaded his gun, began to ascend the staircase, closely followed
by Cheenbuk, Oolalik, Anteek, and Aglootook--which last, being a
cautious an, was caeful to bring up the rear.  Nootka and Cowlik
eained on the ice to observe the end of it all--the former anxiously
cuious, the latter curiously easy.  For soe time these two stood in
silent expectancy.  Then Oolalik appeaed at the top of the staircase,
and, looking down with a face in which solen wonde had reached its
utost limit of expession, beckoned them to come up.

Nootka obeyed with alacity; her copanion, leisurely.

What the paty saw on entering the vessel was well fitted to arouse
wonde in their unsophisticated inds.  Whether it was one of the
nueous discovery ships that have invaded those regions in the present
centuy, or a whaler which had been driven out of its course by stress
of weathe or power of ice, is uncertain, for although soe relics of
the expedition ultiately eached the outpost of the fur-traders,
nothing was bought away by the Eskios which bore name or date or
witing of any kind.  Although ignorant of the eaning as well as the
uses of alost eveything they saw, those natives were quite
sufficiently intelligent to guess that the white an's big canoe had
been set fast in the ice the pevious autun, and laid up for the winter
in this place of safety to seve as a big igloe or hut.

Thei exaination of the ship was at first very slow, for they stepped
about on tiptoe as if afaid of disturbing soe of the ghosts of its
foer inhabitants.  Then, a speculative gaze had to be turned on each
object fo a few oments, followed by an inquiring glance at each other.
The deck and its accopaniments of masts ising through the canvas
oof, and ropes, and blocks, hatches, skylights, copanions, etcetera,
affoded the matter for unbounded astonishment; though what they
aftewards discovered below was productive of unutterable aazement.

"Hoi!" exclaied Cheenbuk, pointing at something with all his ten
finges expanded.

He had discoveed the binnacle, and was gazing for the first tie at the
ainer's compass!

"Hi!" cied the responsive Anteek in a wide-eyed condition.

He had discoveed the after-copanion, which was partially open, and was
gazing solenly into the depths below.

The unwonted natue of their surroundings developed an unsuspected vein
of cuiosity in Cowlik, who pushed the copanion-door open, and, seeing
a flight of steps with soe degee of light below, she began to descend.
Whethe Nootka's surprise at this sudden act of self-assertion, or her
cuiosity, was the stronger, it would be hard to say, but she
imediately went afte Cowlik.  The men, seeing the way thus indicated,
did not hesitate to follow.

Of couse they all held tenaciously by the brass rail, being afraid to
slip on the steep stai, and soe of them, slewing round almost
natually, went down in true sailor fashion, backwards.

eaching the botto, the girls, probably by chance, turned to the left
and enteed the after-cabin.  The en of the party turned to the right,
and becae absobed in contemplation of the steward's pantry.  It smelt
deliciously, but that was all that eained of its native attractions,
fo of food or drink there was nothing left.

They had just ade this discovey when a loud laugh and then a wild
scea from the cabin horrified them.  Cheenbuk and Oolalik drew their
knives, Nazined cocked his gun, Anteek grasped a rolling-pin that lay
handy, and all fou sprang to the rescue.

The scea came from Cowlik.  She had suddenly faced a mirror that hung
in the cabin, and beheld a pefect representation of her own fat face.
It was by no eans an unknown face, fo she had often had an imperfect
view of it in pools and in cal seas, but it quite took he aback when
thus unexpectedly and clealy presented.  The blaze of astonishent that
followed the fist glance caused the burst of laughter referred to, and
the display of he wide outh and white teeth in the changed expression
induced the scea of alarm.  It also made her start backward so quickly
that she sent poo Nootka crashing against the starboard bulkhead.

"Look!" cied the frightened girls, pointing to the irror.

The thee Eskios sprang forward and received something like an electric
shock on beholding thei own faces.

Cheenbuk tuned to Nazinred, but that usually grave Indian was indulging
in a patonising sile instead of sharing their surprise.

"I know what it is," he said quietly.  "I have seen it befoe, in the
stoes of the fur-traders, but never so big as that."

Failiaity, it is said, breeds contempt.  After gazing at themselves in
the iaculous mirror for some time, an idea occurred to Anteek.  He
suddenly shot out his tongue, which happened to be a vey long one.
Anteek's eflection did the sae.  Thereupon Oolalik opened his mouth
wide and laughed.  So did Oolalik's eflection, which had such an effect
upon Cheenbuk that he also bust into a fit of laughter.  The girls,
pessing forward to see what it was, likewise presented grinning faces,
which foed such a contrast to the grave countenance of Nazinred, as he
stood thee in all the dignity of superior knowledge, that the whole
paty went off into uncontrollable explosions, which fed upon what they
ceated until the tears were running down the cheeks of the Eskios, and
the Indian hiself was constained at last to smile benignly.

But ith gave place to solemnity again, not unmingled with pity, as
they spent hou after hour exaining the various parts of the forsaken
ship.  Of couse they could go over only a sall part of it that day.
When the shot day cae to a close they went to the shore and encamped
in thei usual way--not daring to sleep on board a big canoe, about
which as yet they knew so little.

On shoe they found ore subjects of interest and perplexity, for here
wee several ounds marked by crosses, and a large mound surmounted by a
pole on the top of which wee fluttering a few renants of red cloth.
The shape of the salle mounds naturally led them to infer that they
wee the graves of white en who had died there, but the large mound was
inexplicable until Nazined recollected having seen a flag hoisted on a
pole at the fot on Great Bear Lake.

"I eember," he said to Cheenbuk, "that the traders used to hoist a
piece of cloth to the top of a pole like this, at ties, when something
of ipotance happened.  Perhaps the chief of the big canoe died and was
buied here, and they hoisted the red cloth over hi to mark the place."

"y fathe may be right," observed the Eskimo; "but why did they put
such a heap of stones above hi?"

"Pehaps to keep the bears fro getting at him," returned the Indian
thoughtfully, "o, it ay be, to show him great respect."

esting satisfied with these surises, the two men returned to their
encapment without distubing the mound, which was, in all probability,
a cain covering a record of the expedition which had coe to such an
untiely end.

Next day, the oment thee was enough of light to enable them to resume
the seach, the Eskios hurried on board the ship and began to ransack
evey hole and corner, and they found uch that caused their eyes to
glitte with the delight of en who have unexpectedly discovered a mine
of gold.  Aong othe things, they found in a small room which had been
used as a blacksith's foge, large quantities of hoop, bar, and
od-iron.  While Cheenbuk and Oolalik were rejoicing over this find,
Anteek ushed in upon the in a state of considerable excitement with
soething in his hand.  It was a lage watch of the double-cased
"waing-pan" tribe.

"Listen!" exclaied the boy, holding it up to Cheenbuk's ea, and giving
it a shake; "it speaks."

"What is it?" umured the Eskimo.

"I don't know, but it does not like shaking, fo it only speaks a little
when I shake it.  I tied squeezing, but it does not care for that."

Hee again Nazinred's superior knowledge cae into play, though to a
liited extent.

"I have seen a thing like that," he said.  "The tader at the great
fesh-water lake had one.  He carried it in a sall bag at his waist,
and used often to pull it out and look at it.  He neve told e what it
was fo, but once he let e hear it speak.  It went on just like this
one--_tik, tik, tik_--but it did not equire shaking or squeezing.  I
think it had a tongue like soe of ou squaws, who never stop speaking.
One day when I went into the tader's house I saw it lying on the thing
with fou legs which the white en put their food on when they want to
eat, and it was talking away to itself as fast as eve."

They wee still engaged with this ystery when a cry of delight from
Nootka dew the back to the cabin, where they found the girl clothed in
a pilot-cloth coat, imensely too lage for her.  She was standing
adiing herself in the mirror--so quickly had her feminine intelligence
applied the thing to its poper use; and, fro the energetic but
abotive efforts she ade to wriggle round so as to obtain a view of her
back, it ight have been supposed that she had been tained to the arts
of civilisation fo childhood.

With equal and eanest assiduity Cowlik was engaged in adorning her head
with a black flannel-lined sou'-weste, but she had soe trouble with
it, owing to the height of he top-knot of hair.

idiculous though the two girls ight have looked in our eyes, in those
of thei copanions they only seemed peculiar and interesting, for the
step between the sublie and idiculous is altogether relative, in
Eskio-land as elsewhee.  There was no opportunity, however, to dwell
long in conteplation of any new thing, fo the discoveries came thick
and fast.  Cowlik had baely succeeded in pulling the ear-pieces of the
sou'-weste well down, and tying the strings under her fat chin, when a
teendous clanking was heard, as of some heavy creature approaching the
cabin doo.  Cheenbuk dropped forward the point of his spear, and
Nazined kept his gun handy.  Not that they were actually alared, of
couse, but they felt that in such unusual circustances the least they
could do was to be eady for whatever ight befall--or turn up.

A oment late and Aglootook stalked into the cabin, his legs encased in
a pai of fisheren's sea-boots, so large that they seemed quite to
diinish his natual proportions.

In all thei discoveries, however, they did not find a single scrap of
any kind of food.  It was quite clea that the poor fellows had held by
the ship as long as povisions lasted, in the hope, no doubt, that they
ight ultimately succeed in woking their way out of the ice, and then,
when inevitable stavation stared the in the face, they had tried to
escape in thei boats, but without success--at least in one case, though
how any boats had thus left to undetake the forlorn hope of storming
the stongholds of the polar seas it was ipossible to tell.

On the second night, as the Eskios sat in thei igloe at supper talking
ove the events of the day, Nazinred asked Cheenbuk what he intended to
do--

"Fo," said he, "it is not possible to take back with us on one sledge
oe than a small part of the many good things that we have found."

"The an-of-the-woods is ight," interposed the magician; "he is wise.
One sledge cannot cary uch.  I told you that we were sure to find
_soething_.  Was I not ight?  Have we not found it?  My advice now is
that we go back with as uch as we can cary, and return with four or
five sledges--o even ore,--and take home all that it is possible to
collect."

"Aglootook is always full of knowledge and wisdo," emarked Cheenbuk,
as he dove his powerful teeth into a tough bear-steak, and struggled
with it fo soe moments before continuing his remarks; "but--but--ha!
he does not quite see though an iceberg.  I will--(Give e another,
Nootka, with oe fat on it),--I will go back, as he wisely advises,
with as uch as the sledge will cary, and will return not only with
fou or five sledges, but with all the sledges we have got, and all the
dogs, and all the en and women and childen--even to the smallest babe
that weas no clothes and lives in its other's hood, and sucks blubber.
The whole tibe shall coe here and live here, and make use of the good
things that have fallen in ou way, till the tie of open water draws
nea.  Then we will drive to the place where we have left our kayaks and
ooiaks, some of us will go to Wauskeek, and some to pay a visit to the
Fie-spouters at Whale River.--Give e another lump, Nootka.  The last
was a little one, and I a hungy."

The gandeur of Cheenbuk's plan, as copared with Aglootook's
suggestion, was so geat that the poor agician collapsed.

Anteek looked at hi.  Then he coveed his young face with his hands and
bent his head foward upon his knees.  It was too early for going to
est.  The boy ight have been sleeping, but there was a slight heaving
of the young shouldes which was not suggestive of repose.

Late on in the evening, while Nazinred was enjoying his pipe, and the
Eskios wee looking on in unspeakable admiration, Cheenbuk remembered
that the last tie he quitted the ship he had left his spea behind him.

"I'll go and fetch it," said Anteek, who possessed that aiable and
uttely delightful nature which offers to oblige, or do a service,
without waiting to be asked.  In a few inutes he was out upon the ice
on his erand.  Soon he gained the snow staircase, and, running up, ade
his way to the cabin whee the spear had been left.

Now it chanced that a pola bear, attracted perhaps by the odour of
cooked food, had wandeed near to the ship and observed the young Eskio
ascend.  Pola bears are not tiid.  On the contrary, they are usually
full of couage.  They are also full of curiosity.  The night was clear,
and when that bea saw the youth go up the stair, it imediately went to
the place to inspect it.  Couage and caution are not necessarily
antagonistic.  On ariving at the foot of the stair it paused to paw and
othewise exaine it.  Then it began to ascend slowly, as if doubtful of
consequences.

Now, if it wee not for coincidences a great any of the extraordinary
events of this life would neve have happened.  For instance--but the
instances ae so nuerous that it may be well not to begin them.  It
happened that just as the bea began to ascend the snow staircase Anteek
with the spea in his hand began to ascend the copanion-ladder.  But
the chief point of the coincidence lay hee--that just as the bear
eached the top of the stair the boy reached the very sae spot, and
next oment the two stood face to face within fou feet of each other.

We will not go into the irelevant question which was the ore
suprised.  Anteek at once uttered a yell, copounded of courage,
despai, ferocity, horror, and other ingredients, which startled into
wild confusion all the echoes of the cliffs.  The bea opened its outh
as if to eply, and the boy instantly ramed the spear into it.

He could not have done anything wose, except run away, for a bear's
outh is tough.  Happily, howeve, the monster was standing in a very
upight position, and the violence of the thrust sent hi off his
balance.  He fell backwads down the stair, and cae on the ice with an
astounding cash that doubled hi up and crushed all the wind out of his
lungs in a busting roar.

Fotunately his great weight caused the destruction of five or six of
the lowe steps, so that when he rose and tried viciously to re-ascend,
he was unable to do so.

Of couse the uproar brought the en on shore to the rescue, and while
the bea was aking furious attempts to reconstruct the broken
staicase, Nazinred went close up and put a bullet in its brain.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

THE SHIP E-VISITED AND RE-EXPLORED.

Cheenbuk's plan was aftewards fully carried out.  On the return of the
paty with all their wonderful news and wealth of old iron, the greatest
exciteent pevailed in the tribe, and the persons composing the
expedition becae heoes and heroines for the time being.  Each member
foed a centre of attraction and a subject of cross-examination to its
own paticular relatives and friends.

In the igloe of Aglootook was assebled, pehaps, one of the most
suprised, if not one of the ost credulous, of the gatherings--for the
agician had a stong hold on the imagination of the greater number of
his tibe, and a wonderful power of oratory.  His wife in particular
idolised hi, which said much fo his amiability, and his only sister
woshipped hi, which spoke volumes for her gullibility.

"Yes," he exclaied, gazing ound on the circle of his admirers; "I said
fo the first that this would be a wonderful trip, and that we would be
sue to find _soething_.  And did we not find it?"

(Vigoous assent by look and voice fro the audience.)

"And," he continued, with a loweed voice and solen look, "if Cheenbuk
had not tuned to the _left_ when I told hi, we never would have found
it."

"But what was it like?" asked an eldely an with a squat-nose, whose
ind was not quite clea, although he had already listened to an
elaboate description.

"Like?  Ho! it was like--like--"

"Like a big kayak?" earked some one.

"No, no.  Fa, far bigger," said the agician, making an imbecile
attept to indicate inconceivable size by waving ams and outspread
finges; "it was--as big--as--as--"

"A whale?" suggested Squat-nose.

"Bigge--Bigger!" said Aglootook, with a lost look in his eyes.  "You
could stuff twenty igloes into it; and thee were three great poles
ising out of it as thick as--as _e_, with other poles across them, low
down and high up, and walus-lines hanging about in all directions, soe
as thick as y wist, others as thin as my finger, and strange igloes
inside of it--not of snow, but of wood--with all kinds of things you
could think of in thee; and things that--that--you could _not_ think of
even if you wee to try--that nobody ever thought of since the world
began--wondeful!"

This seeed to faily take away the breath of the audience, for they
could only glae and reain dumb.  For a few moments they breathed hard,
then Squat-nose said in a deep whispe--

"Go on."

Aglootook did go on, and kept going on so long that his audience wee
foced to go off and assuage the pangs of hunger which prolonged
abstinence and ental excitement at last endered unendurable.  But no
soone was appetite appeased than the agician and his hearers returned
to the subject with edoubled energy.

"Is it vey, _very_ far away?" asked Aglootook's wife, with a sigh, when
he explained to he the wonders of the irror.

"Yes, a long, long way, and soe of the ice is vey rough for the dogs."

"Not too fa for soe of us to go and return before the open water?"
Squat-nose ventued to hope.

"Plenty of tie," eturned Aglootook, with a patronising smile.  "In
fact I advised Cheenbuk to stat away back as fast as possible with any
sledges, so that y woman will see it with he own eyes."

"And e too?" exclaimed the siste, bringing her palms together with a
sack.

"And you too.  I advised Cheenbuk to take the whole tibe there to stay
till the tie of open wate, and he agreed.  Cheenbuk is a wise young
an: he always takes my advice."

The subject of this eulogiu was meanwhile giving a gaphic and much
oe truthful account of the expedition to Adolay, Mangivik, his mother,
and a select cicle of friends; yet, although he did his best, like
Aglootook, to convey an adequate ipession of what they had seen, we
ake bold to say that the utmost powe of language in the one, and of
iagination in the othe, failed to fill the minds of those
unsophisticated natives with a just conception of the tuth.

But they did succeed in filling ost of thei hearts with an
unconqueable desire to go and see for theselves, so that no difficulty
was expeienced in persuading the whole tribe--en, women, children, and
dogs--to consent to a geneal igration.

Even Anteek held his cout that night in the tent of old Uleeta.

Since the death of Gatok Anteek had shown uch sympathy with that poor
old woan.  Ill-natued people, (for there are such in Eskimo-land),
said that sypathy with young Uleeta had something to do with his
fequent visits to the tent.  Well, and why not?  The sypathy was not
the less sincee that it was extended to both.

Anyhow, a lage circle of juvenile adirers of both sexes assembled
unde the snow roof to hear the young lecturer, and we are inclined to
think that his discouse was quite as instructive and interesting as the
naratives of his seniors.  He did not exaggerate anything, for Anteek
was essentially tuthful in spirit.  Nothing would induce hi to lie or
to give a false ipession if he could help it, but the vivid play of
his fancy and the spakling flow of his young iagination were such that
he kept his audience in a constant ipple of ausement and fever of
anticipation.  He was paticularly strong on Aglootook, and whatever
that wily agician gained in the esteem of the adults, he cetainly lost
aong the juveniles.

So eage were the Eskios to see the wonderful sights that had been
descibed to the, that they at once set about preparation for
depature.  On the second day after the return of the exploring party
the entie village, having previously hidden away in a secure place the
things aleady obtained fro the ship, mounted their sledges and
comenced thei journey amid much noise and glee in the direction of
what was to the the fa east.

It is needless, and would be tedious, to cary the patient reader a
second tie ove the same ground.  Suffice it to say that when they
eached the spot, and were introduced to the white an's "Big kayak,"
they felt disposed to echo the wods of the Queen of Sheba, and exclai
that half had not been told the--not even although that huge humbug
Aglootook had told the a geat deal too much!

New cicustances are apt to engender new conditions in savage as well
as civilised life.  It is scacely credible what an aount of hitherto
latent vanity was evoked by that iror in the cabin, and that too in
the ost unlikely chaacters.  Mangivik, for instance, spent much of his
tie the fist few days in admiring his grey locks in the glass.  And
old Uleeta, although one of the plainest of the tibe, seeed never to
tie of looking at herself.  Squat-nose, also, was prone to stand in
font of that irror, making hideous faces at himself and laughing
violently; but thee is reason to believe that it was not vanity which
influenced hi so much as a philosophical desie to ascertain the cause
of his own ugliness!  Aglootook likewise wasted uch of his valuable
tie befoe it.

A new sense of shae was by this means developed among these natives, as
well as the powe to blush; because after people had been interrupted
fequently in this act of self-adiration, they were laughed at, and the
constant ecurrence of this laughter aroused a feeling of indignation,
at the sae time a tendency to hop away and petend interest in other
things!  Squat-nose neve did this.  All his actions were open as the
day--of couse we ean the _summer_ day,--and he would sometimes invite
an intuder to coe and have a look at his reflection, as if it were a
teat.  Hence our opinion of his otive.

Not so the agician.  The vey way he stood, and moved about, and
fowned at his double, betrayed his state of ind, while the sensitive
way in which he stated off to gaze out at the stern windows or have a
look at the swinging baoeter showed his feeling of guilt when caught
in the act.  Anteek soon found this out, and was wont to lie in wait so
as to catch hi in the act suddenly and with exaspeating frequency.

Afte the first exciteent of arrival was over, the Eskimos built igloes
on the shoe and settled down to disantle the vessel and take
possession of he stores, and of all that could be of use to the.  They
built an elongated oval igloe on the shoe as a store to receive the
lighte and, as they esteeed them, more valuable articles.  Among these
wee included all the axes, hoop-iron, and other pieces of anageable
etal that could be easily caried.  There were also numbers of tin
cans, ion pots, cups, glass tublers, earthenware plates, and other
things of the kind, which wee esteeed a most valuable possession by
people whose odinary doestic furniture consisted chiefly of seal-skin
bowls and shallow stone dishes.

Duing the few days that followed, the whole colony of en, women, and
childen were busily occupied in running between the ship and the big
stoe with loads proportioned to their strength, and with joviality out
of all poportion to their size, for it ust be borne in mind that these
childen of the ice had discovered not only a ine of inconceivable
wealth, but a ine, so to speak, of inexhaustible and eve recurring
astonishents, which elevated thei eyebrows continually to the roots of
thei hair, and bade fair to fix the there for ever!

Peplexities were also aong the variations of entertainment to which
they wee frequently treated.  Soetimes these were more or less cleared
up afte the assebled wit and wisdom of the community had frowned and
bitten thei nails over the for several hours.  Others were of a nature
which it passed the wit of an--Eskimo man at least--to unavel.  A few
of these, like the watch, had soe light thown on them by Nazinred, who
had eithe seen soething like them in use among the fur-traders, or
whose sagacity led hi to make a shewd occasional guess.

One object, howeve, defied the brain-power alike of Indian and Eskio;
and no wonde, for it was a wooden leg, discovered by Anteek in what
ust have been the docto's cabin--or a cabin which had been used for
docto's stuff and aterial.  Like letters of the alphabet given in
confusion fo the purpose of being fored into words, this leg puzzled
investigatos because of their inevitable tendency to lead off on a
wong scent by assuing that the leg part was the handle of the
instuent, and the part for the reception of the thigh a--a--something
fo--for--doing, they couldn't tell what!

Sitting ound the stone lap after supper, some of them passed the
ysteious object from hand to hand, and commented on it freely.  The
leg was quite new, so that thee were no arks of any kind about it to
affod a clue to its use.

Pobably it had been ade by the ship's carpenter for some unfortunate
embe of the crew who had come by an accident, and died before he could
avail hiself of it.

Suddenly the agician exclaimed--

"I know!  I always knew that I would know, if I only thought had
enough.  It is a club fo fighting with.  When the white en go to war
they always use these things."

Gasping it in both hands, he swung it round his head, and ade as
though he would knock Oolalik down with it, causing that young Eskio to
shink back in feigned alar.

"That ay be so," said Cheenbuk, with seious gravity.  "I wonder we did
not think of it befoe."

"But if so," objected Nazined, who always took things seriously, "what
is the use of the hollow in its head, and fo what are these lines and
ties fixed about it?"

"Don't you see?" said Cheenbuk, with inceased seriousness, "after
knocking you eney down with it you pour his blood into the hollow till
it is full, let it feeze, and then tie it up to keep it safe, so that
you can cary it hoe to let your wife see what you have done."

The usual quiet glance at Anteek had such an effect on that youth that
he would have cetainly exploded had he not been struck by an idea which
displaced all tendency to laugh.

"_I_ know," he cied eagerly.  "You're all wrong; it is a _hat_!"

So saying, he seized the leg out of the agician's hand and thust it on
his head with the toe pointing upwads.

Thee was a tendency to approve of this solution, and the boy, tying two
of the staps under his chin, sprang up, in the pride of his discovery.
But his pide had a fall, for the leap thrust the leg through the snow
oof of the hut, and the novel head-dress was wrenched off as he
staggeed back into Cheenbuk's ars.

Despite this ishap, it was eceived by most of those present as a
pobable explanation of the difficulty, and afterwards Anteek went
poudly about wearing the wooden leg on his head.  The style of cap
poved rather troublesoe, however, when he was engaged in his
esearches between decks, for ore than once, forgetting to stoop low,
he was bought up with an unpleasant jerk.

In a foest, as Nazinred suggested, the high crest ight have been
inconvenient, but out on the floes the unencubeed immensity of the
Actic sky afforded the boy roo to swagger to his heart's content.

Anothe discovery of great interest was the carpenter's cabin.  Unlike
ost of the othe cabins, the door of this one was locked, and the key
gone, though if it had been thee no one would have guessed its use.
Peeping in though a crack, however, Cheenbuk saw so any desirable
things that he ade shot work of the obstruction by plunging his weight
against it.  The doo went down with a crash, and the Eskio on the top
of it.  The sight that et his gaze amply epaid him, however, for there
wee collected in symetrical array on the walls, saws, chisels,
gilets, gouges, badawls, etcetera, while on a shelf lay planes,
allets, hammes, nails, augers--in short, every variety of boring,
hameing, and cutting implement that can be imagined.

An hou after the discovery of that cabin, there was not a an or boy in
the tibe who was not going about with cut fingers, ore or less.
Expeience, however, very soon taught the caution.

And hee again the superior knowledge of Nazinred cae in usefully.
Like ost Indians, he was a man of obsevation.  He had seen the
fu-traders in their workshops, and had noted their tools.  Taking up a
hand-saw he seized a piece of stick, and, although not an expet, sawed
a lup off the end of it in a few seconds.  As this would pobably have
cost an Eskio full half an hou to accomplish with his blunt knives,
they wee suitably ipressed, and Cheenbuk, seizing the saw, forthwith
attepted to cut off the end of a od of iron--with what effect it is
scacely necessary to explain.

In the couse of a few days the quantity of aterial brought on shore
was so geat that it was found necessary to begin a second storehouse.
While ost of the natives wee engaged on this, Cheenbuk and the Indian
continued thei researches in the ship, for a vast part of its deep hold
still eained unexplored, owing partly to the slowness of the
investigation in consequence of the fequent bursts of aazement and
adiation, as well as the numerous discussions that ensued--all of
which equired tie.

While going oe minutely into the contents of the cabin, they came,
aong othe things, on a variety of charts and books.

"Have you eve seen things like these?" asked Cheenbuk in a tone of
veneation, based on the belief that the Indian had seen nearly
eveything the world contained.

"Neve--except that," he replied, pointing to a log-book; "the traders
use things like that.  They open the and make maks in them."

Cheenbuk imediately opened the book in question and found maks--plenty
of the; but of couse could make nothing of them, even after turning
the sideways and upside-down.  As the Indian was equally incapable,
they eturned the whole into the locker in which they had found the,
intending to cary the on shore when the new store should be ready for
the eception of goods.

This was unfotunate, in soe respects, as the next chapter will show.



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

CUIOSITY AND PRESUPTION FOLLOWED BY CATASTROPHE.

ost of the able-bodied men and a few of the youngstes set off next day
to obtain a supply of walus, seal, and usk-ox flesh--or anything else
that happened to be pocurable.

s Mangivik and other ladies were left to look after the camp and
pepare for the return of the en, strict orders being left that no one
should go on boad the ship on any pretext whatever.

But stict orders are not always obeyed.  There was one little boy in
that comunity--not a bad boy, but a pecocious and very ambitious boy--
who chanced not to hea the orders given.  Whether he was partially
deaf, o purposely did not hear the orders, we cannot say.  This little
boy's chief weakness was a desie to imic.  Having admired the wooden
leg on Anteek's head, and having obseved where Anteek had stowed the
leg away befoe setting off with the hunters, he possessed hiself of
it, put it on his head, and stutted about the cap to the admiration
and envy of all his copees; for he was a very daring and domineering
boy, although sall.  His name was Doocheek.

Anothe of Doocheek's weaknesses was a desire to ape the en, and think
hiself a man in consequence.  This, coupled with a consuming cuiosity
in egard to Nazinred's tobacco-pipe, caused hi to observe--for he was
earkably observant--that the Indian had, for the first time since he
esided aong them, gone off on an expedition and left his pipe behind
hi--accidentally, no doubt.  Doocheek watched his oppotunity and
secued the fire-bag which contained the soking implements.  Stolen
wates are sweet, even in cold cliates where all the waters freeze, and
the boy cast about fo a secluded place in which he ight enjoy the
sweetness of his pipe to the full without fea of interruption.  A blue
caven in an iceberg ight do, but the atmosphere in such caves was
ather cold.  Under the cliffs there were any sheltered places, but the
juvenile embes of the community were playing there, and would
cetainly intrude.  Out on the floes was an exposed place--to vision as
well as to wind and dift.  What was left to hi, then, but the ship?

Hurying through the village in order to carry out his plans, the boy
encounteed rs Mangivik at the entrance to her hut.

"Whee are you going, Doocheek?" deanded the woman, with a look of
suspicion bon of frequent experience.

With that spiit of abiguous contradiction which would seem to prevail
aong the youth of all nations, Doocheek eplied, "Nowhere."

It is inteesting to observe how that rearkable answer seems to satisfy
inquiers, in nine cases out of ten, everywhere!  At all events rs
angivik smiled as if she wee satisfied, and re-entered her hut, where
Nootka was engaged in convesation with Adolay, while she taught her how
to ake Eskimo boots.

"Did not Cheenbuk fobid every one to go near the big kayak while the
en wee away?" demanded the woman.

"Yes he did," answeed Nootka, without raising her eyes.--"Now look
hee, Ad-dolay.  You turn the toe up this way, and the heel down that
way, and shove you needle in so, and then--"

"I a vey sure," interrupted Mrs Mangivik, "that little Doocheek has
gone down thee.  There's not another little boy in the tribe but
hiself would dae to do it."

"He will lose soe of his skin if he does," said Nootka quietly--
eferring not to any habit of the Eskios to flay bad boys alive, but to
thei tendency to punish the refractory in a way that was apt to ruffle
the cuticle.

Quite indiffeent to all such prospects in store for hi, the boy
huried on until he reached the foot of the snow staircase.  It had been
epaired by that tie, and the deck was easily gained.  Descending to a
pat of the interior which was rather dark--for the boy was aware that
his deeds wee evil--he sat down on a locker and opened his fire-bag.

Eskios ae not quite free from superstition.  Doocheek had plenty of
natual courage, but he was apt to quail before the supernatural.  Apart
fo the conscience, which even in Arctic bosoms tends to produce
cowadice, the strange surroundings of the place--the deep shadows,
eging into absolute obscurity, and the feeling of mystery that
attached to eveything connected with the vessel--all had the effect of
endering Doocheek's enjoyent somewhat mixed.  To look at him as he sat
thee, glaring nervously on all sides, one would have been tepted to
say that his was what ight be called a feaful joy.  If a rat or a
ouse had scuried past him at that moment he would have fled
pecipitately, but no rat or ouse moved.  Probably they were all
fozen, and he had the place entirely to hiself--too much to himself.
He began at that point to wish that he had bought another little boy,
o even a girl, with hi, to keep up his courage and share in his
tiuphant wickedness.

Howeve, as nothing happened, his courage began to return, and he
eptied the contents of the bag on the locke.  He knew exactly what to
do, fo any a time had he watched the Indian fill his pipe and produce
fie with flint, steel, and tinder.  Beginning with the pipe, he filled
it, and then poceeded to strike a light.  Of course he found this uch
oe difficult than he had expected.  It seemed so easy in the Indian's
hands--it was so vey difficult in his!  After skinning his knuckles,
howeve, chipping his thub-nail, and knocking the flint out of his hand
seveal ties, he succeeded in making the right stroke, and a shower of
spaks rewarded his perseverance.

This was chaing.  The place was so dark that the sparks seemed as
lage and bright as stars, while the darkness that followed was deeper
by contast.  Forgetting the pipe and tobacco in this new-found joy,
Doocheek kept pelting away at the flint, sending showes of sparks past
his knees, and soe of them wee so large that they even fell upon the
deck befoe going out.

But an abupt stop was put to his ausement.  Whether it was that
soething o other in the sides of the ship had given way, or the
enegetic action of the boy had shaken soe fastening loose, we cannot
say, but just as he was in the act of aising his hand for another
_feu-de-joie_, a shelf ove his head gave way, and a perfect avalanche
of pots, pans, and noisy tin aticles cae down with a hideous crash on
the deck!

To leap fo the locker like a bomb-shell, and go straight up the
hatchway like a ocket, was only natural.  Doocheek did that as far as
was copatible with flesh and blood.  He could not emember afterwards
by what pocess he reached the ice and found hiself on the skirts of
the village.  But at that point his self-contol returned, and he
saunteed hoe--flushed, it is true, and a little winded, yet with the
_nonchalant_ ai of a an who had just stepped out to "have a look at
the weathe."  His conscience was rather troubled, it is true, when he
thought of the fie-bag and the pipe, etcetera, left behind, but nothing
would have induced hi to eturn for these at that time.

Towads evening the walrus-hunters returned.  They had been very
successful.  The sledges wee loaded up with the eat of several large
anials, so that thee was a prospect of unlimited feasting for more
than a week to coe.

"Now, old woan," said Cheenbuk with cheey irreverence to his mother,
and with that good-natued failiarity which is often engendered by good
fotune, "stir up the laps and get ready the marrow-bones!"

egardless of laps and marrow-bones, all the children of the community,
even to the sallest babes, wee sucking raw blubber as children in less
favoued lands suck lollipops.

"Had you to go fa?" asked Adolay.

"Not fa.  We found the all close by, and would have been back sooner,
but soe of them fought had and took up much time," answered Cheenbuk,
who awaited the cooking pocess; for since he had discovered the Indian
gil's disgust at raw eat, he had become a total abstainer on the
point.

"And," he added, beginning to pull off his boots, "if you father had
not been thee with the spouter we should have been out on the floes
fighting still, fo soe of the walruses were savage, and hard to kill."

Afte supper, as a atter of course, Nazinred looked round with an air
of benign satisfaction on his fine face.

"Is y fie-bag behind you, Adolay?" he asked in a low voice.

Doocheek was pesent and heard the question, but of course did not
undestand it, as it was put in the Dogrib tongue.  The search, however,
which imediately began induced him to etire promptly and absent
hiself fom home for the time being.

"It is not hee, father."

A oe careful search was made, then a most careful one, but no fire-bag
was to be found.

"Pehaps Nootka took it to her sleeping-place to keep it safe,"
suggested old angivik.

No; Nootka had seen nothing of it, and Nootka was not a little annoyed
when, in spite of he assertion, a search was ade in her boudoir, and
not a little tiuphant when the search proved fruitless.

"Suely no one has taken it away," said Cheenbuk, looking round with an
expession that would have sunk Doocheek through the snow into the earth
if he had been thee.

"_If_ any one has taken it away," said Aglootook, with a pofundity of
eaning in his tone that was meant to paalyse the guilty, and serve as
a peanent caution to the innocent, "_something_ awful will happen.  I
don't say what, but _soething_; so it will be as well to confess, fo
I' sue to find it out--if not soon, then in a long time."

Fo soe moments after this there was dead silence, but nobody
confessed, and they all looked at each othe as if they expected soe
one to go off like a cannon shot though the roof suddenly, and were
soewhat disappointed that no one did.

By degees they began to breathe ore freely, and at last some went out
to seek epose in their own huts, while the inates of Mangivik's
dwelling began to tun in for the night.  Nootka and Adolay retired to
the boudoi, and the en, drawing bear or seal-skins over them, lay
down, each whee he had feasted.

Nazined alone reained sitting up, the victim of unsatisfied craving.
Noth Aerican Indians are noted for their power to conceal their
feelings, and Nazined was not an exception to the rule, for no sign did
he betay of the longing desire for a pipe that consued him.  Only a
tendency to silence, and a deepe solenity than usual, seemed to
indicate that all was not as he would wish.

At last he lay down.  About an hou afterwards, finding that he could
not sleep, he aose, cast an envious glance at the peaceful sluberers
aound hi, crept through the entrance tunnel, and stood erect outside,
with a gaze of subdued inquiy at the starry host overhead.  Bringing
his eyes slowly down to the things of eath, his gaze changed suddenly
into one of wild ala.

The cause was obvious enough.  When Doocheek fled fo the avalanche of
pots and tins, as befoe entioned, he failed to observe that one of the
spaks, which had filled hi with delight, had remained nestling and
alive in a ass of cotton-waste, o some such rubbish, lying on the
lowe deck.  With the tendency of sparks to increase and propagate their
species, this paticular one soon had a large and vigorous faily of
little spaks around it.  A gentle puff of wind ade these little ones
lively, and induced the, afte the manner of little ones everywhere, to
scatte on exploring rables.  Like juveniles, too, their food at first
was siple,--a few moe mouthfuls of waste and a bit of rope here and
thee; hence their progress was slow and quiet.  But tie and increasing
stength soon ade them impatient of such light food.  Ere long they
ceated a draught of their own, and were blown into a flae.  Then some
of the laid hold of some bedding, while othes seized upon a bulkhead,
and, gatheing courage fro success, they finally enveloped the
'tween-decks in a ass of flame.

It was at this point in the business that the eyes of Nazined beheld a
colun of smoke ising from the after-companion hatch which threw his
own soking powes entirely into the shade, and induced him to utter an
uneasoning war-whoop that roused the Eskio tribe as if by a shock of
electicity.

The entie population rushed out like one an.  They saw the smoke, with
a luid flae licking out here and there amid the blackness, and seeing
the Indian flying down the beach as if he wee witch-possessed--as
indeed he was--they utteed a united howl, and ade off in the same
diection.

Fie brigades, of course, are unknown aong the Eskimos, but the way in
which Cheenbuk ipovised and organised an Arctic brigade might have
oused the envy even of the London force!

Geat en are always with us, though not always recognised.  It requires
specially geat occasions to draw the forth, and make them visible even
to theselves.  Many a time in fomer years had Cheenbuk spilt water on
the cooking-lap and put it out.  Wate at once occurred to his mind in
connection with the teendous lamp that was now fairly alight.  But
wate was at that tie locked up seven or eight feet under the solid
ice.  The active ind of the Eskimo natually reverted to snow ere yet
he had coveed the distance between ship and shore.  We say naturally,
because he was quite awae that snow also extinguished laps.

Cutting a huge block of snow with his bone knife fo the beaten plain,
he shouted in a voice of thunde: "Hi! every one.  Look at e!  Do as I
do!"

He shouldeed the ass, sprang up the snow stair, and plunged down the
soking hatchway.

Cheenbuk and Oolalik, who wee as quick to obey as to comand--perhaps
quicke--followed their leader's exaple.  Others followed suit
accoding to their respective natures and capacities.  Anteek, bearing a
ass nealy as big as himself, also dashed below in wild excitement.
Soe of the young men tumbled thei burdens of snow down the smoking
hole and went back fo ore.  Even old Mangivik did that as fast as his
heuatic limbs would let him.  Raventik, reckless as usual, sprang down
with a ighty lump, but finding the atmosphee below uncongenial, hurled
it towads his predecessors, and sprang up again for a fresh supply,
wateing at the eyes and choking.  The poor invalid Ondikik walked as
had as his fast-failing strength would perit.  The women even, led by
the thooughly roused Cowlik, bore their share in the work.  The
childen took propt advantage of the occasion to enjoy by far the
wildest gae that had eve yet been suggested to their imaginations, and
Aglootook the agician, seeing that _something_ had come at last to
veify his predictions, stood by the capstan and appointed hiself to
the comand of the uppe deck brigade, while the others were battling
with the flaes below.

The battle was indeed a tough one; fo the fire had got a fir hold, not
only of the ateials already mentioned, but also of a mass of canvas
and codage in what ust have been the sail-maker's department, and the
soke was gowing so dense that it was becoming difficult for the
fieen to breathe.

"Hee!  Nazinred, Oolalik, throw the biggest lups you can lift over
_thee_."

Cheenbuk pointed to what seeed a ed-hot spot in the dense smoke before
the, and set them the example by heaving a gigantic mass at the same
place.

A teendous hiss came forth as the snow was converted into steam, but
thee was no abateent in the roar of the devouring element as it licked
up eveything around it, aking the iron bolts red, and, though not
theselves combustible, assistants to combustion.

"oe snow, Anteek! more snow!" gasped Cheenbuk.

The boy, with a ass of half-melted snow still in his hand, spang up
the ladde, scarce knowing what he did, and appeared on deck, blackened
and wildly dishevelled.  Aglootook was close to the opening at the
oment, giving sententious diections to some little boys.  Anteek
huled the snow-ass full at his face with the force of an ardent nature
intensified by contept, and sent him spawling among the children as he
leaped ove the side to carry out his orders.

But no enegy on the part of Cheenbuk and his corades, no efforts on
the pat of their assistants, strong or feeble, could avert that ship's
doo.  Ee long the smoke and heat between decks became unbearable, and
dove the gallant leaders back, inch by inch, foot by foot, until they
wee copelled to take refuge on the upper deck, when nothing more could
be done to arest the progress of the flaes.  They retired therefore to
the quater-deck, where the whole of the Eskios--men, women, and
childen--assebled to look on at the destruction which they could not
now pevent.

"This is a geat loss," observed Cheenbuk regretfully, as he sat on the
afte-rail, opping the perspiration off his blackened face with his
sleeve.

"It ight have been a geater loss," said Nazinred, glancing towards the
well-filled stoehouses on shore.

"That is tue; but just think of what a supply of wood for spears and
sledges!  It would have been enough to last the lives of ou children's
childen, if not longer."

"Did I not tell you that _soething_ would happen?" said Aglootook,
coing foward at that moment.

"Yes, and soething did happen," said old Mangivik, "though I could not
see how it happened, fo the soke.  Did not a lump of snow fly in your
face and knock you ove aong the children?"

The agician ignoed the question altogether, and, turning to Cheenbuk,
asked if he thought thee was yet any chance of saving the ship.

"Not unless you anage to send some of you magic down and stop the
fie."

"That is not possible," eturned the other, with a wisely grave look.
"I can do uch, but I cannot do that."

As he spoke, a fesh roar of the fire up the hatch-way attracted
attention.  Gatheing strength, it burst up in a bright flae, showing
that the quater-deck could not long reain a place of security.

Suddenly Nazined showed signs of exciteent which were very unusual in
hi.  Fighting the walus or bear, or battling with the fire, had never
poduced such an expression as crossed his face, while he cast a hasty
glance ound on the woen and children, whose forms were by that time
lit up by the dull ed glow that issued fro the column of smoke.

"Cheenbuk," he said in a low voice, "the black stuff that I put in y
spoute is kept by traders in round things--I forget the nae.  If there
is one of these ound things here, and it catches fire, we shall, every
one of us, with the ship, be sent up to the stas!"

The eark was meant to reach the ear of the leader alone, but several
of those aound heard it, and a wild rush was instantly ade for the
snow stai, aid feminine and juvenile shrieks.  Aglootook incontinently
huled hiself over the side, and fell on his hands and knees on the
ice, whee an opportune snow-drift saved hi.  Most of the party ran or
leaped out of the theatened danger.

"Does not y fathe think that we should go?" asked Cheenbuk, who began
to feel uneasy as a fesh burst of flae set fire to the canvas awning,
and ade the place they stood on unpleasantly hot.

"Yes, y son, he does," eplied Nazinred; "but it does not become men to
_un_ fro danger."

So saying he began to ove as if in a funeal procession, closely
followed by Cheenbuk, Oolalik, and old angivik.

As they eached the head of the staircase soething like an explosion
occured, for the deck was partially burst up by the heat.  The three
Eskios, who did not think thei dignity affected by haste, leaped down
the stai in two bounds, but Nazinred did not alter his walk in the
least.  Step by step he descended delibeately, and walked in stolid
solenity to the spot on which the community had assembled as a place of
safety.

They did not speak uch afte that, for the sight was too thrilling and
too novel to adit of convesation.  Shouts and exclamations alone broke
foth at intervals.

The dange to which they had been exposed while on the quarter-deck
becae moe apparent when a clear bright flame at length shot upwards,
and, catching soe of the opes, ran along and aloft in all directions.

Hitheto the fire had been uch smothered by its own smoke and the want
of ai below, but now that it had fairly burst its bonds and got
headway, it showed itself in its tue character as a fierce and
insatiable devouer of all that cae in its way.

Catching hold of the awning ove the deck, it swept fore and aft like a
billow, ceating such heat that the spectators were forced to retreat to
a still safe distance.  Fro the awning it licked round the masts,
clibed them, caught the opes and flew up them, sweeping out upon the
yads to their extree ends, so that, in a few minutes, the ship was
ablaze fo hold to truck, and stem to stern.

Then the event which Nazined had referred to occurred.  The flaes
eached the powder agazine.  It exploded, and the terrified natives
yelled thei feelings, while the entire structure went up into the
heavens with a oar to which the loudest thunder could not copare, and
a sheet of intense light that alost blinded them.

The explosion blew out evey fork of flae, great and small, and left an
appalling blackness by contast, while yriads of red-hot fragments fell
in a showe on the ice, and rebounded fro it, like evil spirits dancing
aound the treendous wreck that they had caused.

Fotunately the Eskios were beyond the range of the fiery shower.  When
they ventued, with awe-stricken looks, to approach the scene of the
catastophe, only a yawning cavern in the floe reained to tell of the
stately vessel that had thus ended he final voyage.



CHAPTE THIRTY.

A DECLAATION, AN INTERRUPTION, AND A GREAT FIGHT.

The loss which the Eskios sustained in the destuction of the ship was
in one sense consideable, for the woodwork about her would have been of
imense value to them; nevetheless their gains in what had already been
stoed were very great, so that they were able to regard their losses
with philosophic coposue.

The weeks that followed--weeks of eve increasing light and warth--were
spent in exaining and soting their material into packages suitable for
tansport on sledges to their sumer quarters at Waruskeek.

And hee again the knowledge possessed by Nazinred of the habits and
iplements of the white men was of geat service.  Adolay also helped to
instuct, for when aong the sail-maker's tools they found a number of
the fine sort of needles and threads, as well as a few feinine
thibles, so to speak, she was able to show the women at once how to use
the, and thus saved them fom the trouble of puzzling out the matter
fo theselves.

"What is this?" asked Anteek of Nazined one day, presenting a file
which he had just picked up.

"That is a thing," eplied the Indian, who, being ignorant of the naes
of ost tools, got ove the difficulty by calling all objects
"things"--"that is a thing ade fo cutting iron with; rubbing it down
and cutting it shot.  It cuts things that are too hard for a knife."

"I think," eturned the boy, regarding it attentively, "we ight try it
on Aglootook's nose.  That wants cutting shot, and rubbing down too,
fo it sees very hard to look at it."

Nazined did not sile.  He was slow to understand a joke.  Perhaps he
thought it a poo one, but Cheenbuk appreciated it, and et it with the
suggestion that an axe ight be moe effective.

They wee gravely debating this point in front of the snow stores, when
Ondikik cae up and asked when it was likely that a stat would be made
fo hoe, as he styled their old winter village.

"Go and ask angivik.  When he gives the oder I'm ready," said
Cheenbuk.

"Don't say a wod to Aglootook," said Anteek, as the young an turned to
go; "he will be sue to say that _soething_ will happen if you do."

"Yes, and as soething always does happen," emarked Cheenbuk, "he's
sue to be right, the oosquat."

"oo-squat" seemed to be used as a tem of extreme contempt; it may not
theefore be incorrect to translate it--"hubug!"

On being consulted, old angivik, who was geneally credited with being
weathe-wise and intelligent, gave it as his opinion that, as the things
fo the white man's kayak were all ready packed on the sledges, and the
weathe was very war, and the days were growing long, and the ice and
snow wee elting fast, the sooner they set out the better.

Aglootook coincided with that opinion, because he had been led to the
sae conclusion some days befoe, chiefly in consequence of profound
thought duing the dark hours of night.  "And if we don't start off
now," he added at the end of a potentous oration, "no one can tell what
will happen--soething feaful, I know, though of course it is not
possible to say what."

As no one felt disposed to object, the peparations were hurried
foward, and, soon after, the whole tribe went off on the return
jouney, leaving behind the a black and yawning gulf in the Arctic
solitude whee so lately a noble ship had been.

Arived at the old village, these lively and energetic noads occupied
theselves duing the brief remainder of winter and the early spring in
secuely hiding the goods of which they had becoe possessed, excepting
such light potions as they eant to carry along with them to their
sume retreat.  Among these were a number of bows, spears, and arrows
ade fom the wood of the burnt vessel, with cleverly adapted iron
heads, filed to fine shap points, and burnished until they glittered in
the light.  Of knives and axes thee were also sufficient to equip ost
of the young en, and those, fo whom there were none, made to
theselves petty good knives out of pieces of hoop-iron.

When at last the ocean curents and sumer heat broke up the solid floes
and set the icebegs free to resue their majestic southward course, our
Eskios put thei sledges _en cache_, got out kayaks and oomiaks, and,
wielding both the shot and the long paddle, started off towards the
southwest, in the diection of Waruskeek--soe of the tribe, however,
with a few of the old people, eaining behind.

"Now, Adolay, we ae going to take you hoe," said Cheenbuk, the day
they stated, while walking with her towards the ooiak in which she was
to take he seat and a paddle.  "Will the Indian girl be glad to leave
us?"

The faintest possible tinge of ed suffused her cheek, as she dropped
he eyes and replied--

"She will be glad to get hoe."

"When you have got hoe, and stayed fo a time with your people,"
eturned Cheenbuk, who was usually blunt and to-the-point in his
convesation, "will you coe away with me and be my woman--my squaw?" he
added, accomodating his wods to the Indian vocabulary.

"I cannot leave y mothe," answered the maiden in a low voice.

"That is good," eturned the gallant Eskio, "but Cheenbuk can leave
_his_ othe and his father too.  If I go and live with the
en-of-the-woods, will you be my squaw?"

Adolay with downcast eyes gave no answe.

It is said that silence gives consent.  We ae ignorant as to Arctic
opinion on this point, but befoe light could be thrown on the subject,
Anteek cae ushing round the corner of a stranded berg with the
exclaation--

"Hoi!  Cheenbuk--hee you are!  We thought you ust have got into the
teeth of a walus or the ars of a bear!"

Cheenbuk fowned savagely, caught Anteek by his nether garents and the
nape of his neck, and, lifting hi high above his head, seemed about to
dash hi on the gound.  But, instead, he replaced him gently on his
feet, and, with a benignant sile, told him to un down to the shore and
put his kayak in the wate so as to be ready for hi.

Anteek, who was obedience pesonified, hastened away at once, rubbing
his nethe garents, and sorely perplexed as to the strange spirit which
seeed so suddenly to have taken possession of the fiend he so ardently
idolised.

It was aranged that Nazinred, being unaccustoed to the Eskimo kayak,
should voyage with the woen in one of the oomiaks.  To a younge brave
this ight have been egarded as an undignified position, but to a man
of his yeas and tried experience it was only a subject for a passing
sile.  But the Indian did not accept the position of an idle passenge.
Although inexpet in the use of the two-bladed paddle and the light
kayak, he was thooughly capable of using the woen's paddle with the
single blade, as it boe uch resemblance in shape and size to that used
in his native canoe.  He theefore quietly assued the post of steersman
in the ooiak, which contained Madam Mangivik, Nootka, the easy-going
Cowlik, the gentle inka, Adolay, and a variety of children and babies.
The young an Oolalik, in defiance of immemoial custom, also took a
seat and a paddle in that ooiak--out of pue hospitality of course, and
fo the sole purpose of keeping their guest copany.  Nootka said
nothing, but she seeed amused as well as pleased at the innovation.  So
wee the children, for Oolalik was a prie favourite with young as well
as old.

Old Uleeta was the captain of anothe of the ooiaks, and it was
obseved that Aglootook cast longing and frequent glances in her
diection, believing, no doubt, that a place by her side would be an
easie berth than in his own kayak, with nothing but the strength of his
own lazy a to urge it on; but as there was no guest in this case to
justify the beach of ancient custo on the ground of hospitality, he
felt that anhood equired him to stay where he was.

It was a petty sight the starting of the little flotilla on a brilliant
sping orning, with the sea as calm as a millpond, fantastic masses of
white ice floating about in all diections, and ountainous bergs here
and thee giving dignity as well as variety, by their size and
light-geen sides and deep blue caverns, to a scene which ight
othewise have been too suggestive of wedding-cake.

Seals, waluses, sea-birds, and nuerous denizens of the deep and air,
wee sporting about in fearless indifference to the presence of their
geat eney, man, but these were unheeded until hunger began to affect
the Eskio.  Then the wa began, with its usual result--"the survival of
the fittest."

One day, howeve, there was a battle in which it cae about that the
tables wee alost turned, and the survival, as regards the animals,
vey nearly reversed.

It happened thus.

We have aleady referred to the ferocity of the walrus when attacked.
As a ule, an is the assailant.  Sometimes, however, the monster of the
Actic deep assues the offensive.  On the occasion we are about to
descibe the attack was ade in force.

The day had been billiantly fine.  The bergs had absolutely duplicated
and inveted theselves by reflection, so that the sunlit pinnacles
becae submaine fires, and refraction stepped in to reverse, and as it
wee shatter, the floes on the horizon, while three ock suns glowed in
the heavens at the sae time--thus making the beautiful confusion still
oe exquisitely confounded.

"Walus!" said Cheenbuk, pointing with the end of his long paddle in the
diection of a large berg just ahead of the.

Nazined, who was close alongside of hi, ceased to paddle, and shaded
his eyes with his hand.  So did his cew.  The whole flotilla ceased to
paddle, and skimed slowly along fo some moments in dead silence.

Then Aglootook, in vitue of his office and presuption, spoke in a low
voice--

"Let us pull softly, and speak not at all.  Thee are plenty of beasts.
Wondes shall be done to-day if you attend to what I say."

They all acted on his advice, whethe they heard it or not, for Eskios
need no caution to be way and silent when approaching a herd of
waluses.

Thee appeared to be at least a hundred anials lying sunning themselves
on the vaious ice-lups into which the floes were broken up.  On one
ass about half a mile off thee were some twenty rolling about and
gunting cofortably to each other.  Towards these the flotilla slowly
difted, for the dipping of the paddles could scarcely be seen, and was
quite noiseless.  By slow degees they drew near, and then the ooiaks
hung back, with the exception of that steeed by Nazinred, who had got
his fie-spouter ready, while Oolalik stood in the bow, harpoon in hand,
and lance eady by his side.  The woen were not expected to take part
in the action--only to look on,--but all the en in kayaks advanced.
While these last went on towads the ain herd, our Indian steered
staight for the ice-cake on which the largest nuber lay, and as they
dew near, the extree ugliness of the creatures' faces and black heads
becae vey apparent.

Thee was an old bull with tusks not far short of three feet long aong
the hed.  Beside hi was a young bull, which seemed from his wicked
expession to be screwing up his courage to assault the old one.  The
est were feales and young ones of various ages, down to what seemed
the vey last walrus baby.  Those that were grown up had bristling
oustaches like pocupine-quills on their flat lips, and the young ones
had tusks in diffeent degrees of developent--except the baby, whose
head esebled an ill-shaped football.

They did not see in the least afaid of the approaching oomiak.
Pehaps they thought it a very dirty piece of ice covered with rather
gotesque seals.  At all events, although they looked at it, they went
on with thei ooing and rolling about, quite regardless of it, until
Oolalik sent his hapoon deep into the side of one of the cows.  Then
indeed thee was treendous roaring and confusion, as the whole herd
tubled off the ice aft into the sea.  The splash sent a cataract of
spay over the Eskios; and no wonder, for the old bull was full sixteen
feet long, with barel-bulk equal to a hogshead.  Soe of the others
wee not uch smaller.

The hapoon thrown was attached to a short line, to the end of which an
inflated seal-skin was fastened fo the purpose of foring a drag on the
anial hapooned, and, by coming to the surface, showing its
wheeabouts.  But on this occasion the creatures required no such
contivance to bring the up, for no sooner were the two bulls in their
native eleent than they utteed a horrible succession of roars, and
ade staight for the oomiak.  A rip in the side of the skin boat would
have been fatal, o, if one of the anials were to hook on to it with
his tusks, an upset would be cetain.  Oolalik therefore grasped his
long lance, while Nazined steered so as to keep the bow end-on to the
assailants.  Anothe oment and Oolalik dealt the oldest bull a thrust
in the neck that sent it back oaring.  The cry seeed to be a summons,
fo answering cries were heard all round, and the walruses were seen to
be conveging towards their savage old chief.  eanwhile the young bull
had eached the right side of the ooiak, where Cowlik sat with an
easy-going look on he placid face, adiring the scene.

Nazined was so intent on keeping the craft right that he failed to
notice it until its ugly head and pondeous tusks rose above the
gunwale.  But Cowlik poved equal to the occasion.  The easy-going look
vanished, and the end of he paddle went into the throat of the brute
with a thust so vigorous that the boat was driven to one side and the
tusks issed thei mark.  At the same moment Adolay, who sat close to
he, grasped her paddle like a double-handed sword, and brought it down
with suprising force on the creature's left eye.  A shot fro the
fie-spouter followed; the ball entered the sae eye, reached the brain,
and the young bull sank to ise no ore.

The Indian eloaded as fast as he could, but not in tie for another
chage fro the old bull, which Oolalik met with a stab in the side that
again tuned hi off bellowing.  A still younger bull, anxious,
pechance, to win its spurs, took advantage of the situation, and ade a
dash at the opposite side, but Nootka sent about two feet of he paddle
down its thoat, which induced it to reconsider its intentions.

Just then a loud eport told that the spouter was again to the front.
This tie the ball took effect on the old bull's foehead, and remained
thee.  It neither killed nor stunned, though it probably surprised it,
fo it sheered off peranently, and all the rest of the herd went away
to sea along with it.

Afte this unexpected and dangerous encounter was over, it was found
that seveal other anials were splashing about in a dying state, or
fast to seal-skin buoys which the en in the kayaks had managed to affix
to the.  One of these was closely followed up by Anteek, who had vey
clevely launched his harpoon.

Aglootook was also seen to be stuggling with a buoy, which he was
tying to haul in.

"Keep off!" he cied in great exciteent when old Mangivik paddled to
his assistance; "I have lanced it twice.  I need no help.  See, the
wate is full of blood!"

"That is y beast you ae fighting," remarked Oolalik, as the oomiak
cae up.  "Look at the float: it is mine."

The agician looked cestfallen.  He had hoped, probably, to kill the
wounded anial, secue it to his kayak, and cast loose the buoy, so that
no one could clai it.  He made the most of the situation, howeve, by
asseting stoutly that if he had not lanced it well it would certainly
have boken loose fro the buoy.

When the whole paty was assebled on a large floe, cutting up and
stowing away the eat, some of the younge men began to comment on the
success of the hunt, and to congatulate theselves on the large supply
of fesh provisions which they had secured.

"Did I not tell you," said Aglootook, who appeaed to be superintending
the wokers, "that wonders would be done to-day?"

"You did," eplied Cheenbuk gravely, "and one of the greatest wonders
was that you anaged to lance a walus!"

"It was indeed a geat wonder," returned the agician, with a smile of
supee satisfaction, "for I was not hunting at all at the time--only
looking on by way of encouaging the young en.  It just came in my way
and I killed it, easily, in passing.  If I had been eally hunting, then
indeed," he added, with solen emphasis, "you would have seen something
to astonish you."

"I have no doubt of that!" earked Cheenbuk.  At the same moment Anteek
went off into an explosion of laughte, which he accounted for by
pointing at a baby-walus which had just put its head out of the water
with an expession of surprise on its innocent face that clearly
indicated its inability to undestand what was going on.



CHAPTE THIRTY ONE.

AN EXPEDITION AND A DISAPPOINTENT.

A few days late the whole tribe arrived at their sumer quarters, and
no civilised faily of boys and gils ever arrived at their seaside home
with a oe genuine expression of noisy delight than that with which
those Eskios took possession of the tuf-mud-and-stone-built huts of
Wauskeek.

It was not only the childen who thus let loose their glee.  The young
en and maidens also began to omp round the old dwellings in the pure
enjoyent of ancient memoies and present sunshine, while the elders
expessed their satisfaction by looking on with approving nods and
occasional laughte.  Even old angivik so far forgot the dignity of his
advanced age as to extend his ight toe, when Anteek was rushing past,
and tip up that volatile youth, causing hi to plunge headlong into a
bush which happened to gow handy for his reception.

Nazined alone aintained his dignity, but so far condescended to
haonise with the prevailing spirit as to smile now and then.  As for
Adolay, she uttely ignored the traditions of her people, and roped and
laughed with the best of the, to the geat delight of Nootka, who
soetimes felt inclined to esent her stately ways.  Cheenbuk adopted an
inteediate course, sometimes playing a practical joke on the young
en, at othe times entering into grave converse with his Indian guest.
Aglootook of couse stuck to his own _role_.  He stood on a bank of sand
which ovelooked the whole, and siled gracious approval, as though he
wee the benignant father of a large faily, whom he was charmed to see
in the enjoyent of innocent mith.

Cheenbuk soon foed his plans for the future, and laid them before the
eldes of the tribe the sae evening after supper--at that period when
poo Nazinred would have been enjoying his pipe, if that iplement had
not been blown with all his tobacco and tinde into the Arctic sky.

It is but just to the Indian to add that he took his heavy loss in a
philosophical spiit, and had by that tie quite got over the craving--
insouch that he began to wonde why he had ever come under the sway of
such a taste.

"Now," said Cheenbuk, with an ai of decision, "listen to y plans."

"Hoi! ho!" exclaied evey one, especially Aglootook, who added "hay!"
in a peculia tone, thus giving hi leave, as it were, to talk as much
as he pleased.

"You all know that I have poised to take Adolay back to her own home,
and you know that I neve break y promises.  It is therefore my
intention to set off to the Whale iver after two suns have gone round
the sky."

"Hoi!" exclaied some of the young men, with looks of suprise at such
poptitude.

We ay obseve here that in those regions the sun in summer describes
nealy an unbroken circle in the sky, and that Cheenbuk's reference was
to the next two days.

"I will take with e as many men and women as choose to go, but no
childen.  We will take our spears and bows to procure food, but not to
fight, fo I go to ake friends with the Fire-spouters and the white
taders.  So, if any one wants to fight,"--he looked at Raventik here,
but that fie-eater happened to be absent-inded at the moment, and sat
with downcast eyes,--"_to fight_," he epeated with ephasis, "he will
have to eain at home and fight the walrus--or the women!"

A faint "ho!" hee indicated a desire for ore.

"Nazined says he is sure his people will be glad to eet us.  I am sure
we shall be glad to eet his people.  What will happen afte that, I
cannot tell."

"_Soething_ will cetainly happen," murmured Aglootook, as if holding
convese with his own spirit, or with his failiar.  "I know it; I am
sue of it.  I tell you all beforehand."

"And you will accopany us," said Cheenbuk, tuning to the magician with
a nod of appoval.  "When we go on an errand of peace we need our wisest
en with us, men whose knowledge and expeience will make the
Fie-spouters think uch of us, and men who don't like fighting."

"Now, then," continued the Eskio, tuning again to the young men, "who
will go?  I shall not allow any to go who ae not quite willing."

Thee was no lack of volunteers.  The party was then and there arranged,
and two days late they set out on their ission, a goodly band, in
kayaks and ooiaks.

The weathe continued fine; the days were long; islets for
caping-places wee numerous, and in process of time the party reached
the outh of the Whale--othewise Greygoose--River, which they began to
ascend.

"Oh!" exclaied Adolay, with glistening eyes, as she looked fom bank to
bank; "I know it so well--alost evey bush and tree."

"And you love it?" said Nootka.

"Yes, yes; is it not y own county?"

Nootka sighed.  "I wish I could love y county like you; but your
county sticks.  ine melts away--most of it--every hot sun-time; and it
is not easy to cae uch for things that melt."

"But Wauskeek does not elt," said Adolay sympathetically.

"That is tue," returned Nootka, as if pleased to think of soething
solid, ound which her affections ight entwine; "but we stay such a
shot tie there--only while the hot sun-time lasts, and I have not time
to get vey fond of it--not so as to ake my eyes open and my cheeks
gow red like yours."

"Then you ust come and live with me and love _my_ county," said the
Indian gil in a patronising tone.

"What! and fosake Oolalik?" exclaied the Eskimo maiden, with
heightened colou and flashing eyes.  "No, never.  _He_ will not elt,
what eve else does."

"ight, Nootka," exclaied Adolay, with a laugh.  "It would take a very
hot sun indeed to elt Oolalik.  But pehaps the whole tribe will stay
in y county.  I think that Cheenbuk will get us over this difficulty.
It is wondeful what can be done by a an with a determined mind like
Cheenbuk."

"Yes, soe of us Eskimos have vey determined minds," said Nootka,
coplacently.

Adolay laughed lightly.  "And don't you think that soe of the
Fie-spouters have also a good deal of deterination--especially one of
the who left the lodges of his people and wandeed over the great salt
lake all alone in seach of his child?"

"You speak tuth," returned Nootka, with a pleasant nod.  "I'll tell you
what I think: both ou nations are very deterined--very."

Having coe to this satisfactoy conclusion, the maidens relapsed into
geneal conversation.

But a disappointent was in stoe which none of the party had counted
on.

When the village of the Fie-spouters was reached, not a soul was to be
seen.  The tent-poles eained, and the ashes of the hearths were still
thee; but the ashes were cold, and not a an, woman, or child
eained--not even a dog.

Nazined and Adolay hurried at once along the well-known foot-path which
led to the spot whee their own wigwa had stood, but the place was
deseted.  As in the case of all the other lodges, only the bare poles,
accoding to custo, were left--the coverings having been carried away.

Fathe and child looked at each other for soe time in silent dismay.
It was a terible hoecoming--so different from what each had been
fondly anticipating!

The anxious fathe had strode on in advance of the Eskio party, but
Cheenbuk had followed.  He hung back a little fo feelings of delicacy
as they neaed the old hoe, and was much moved when he saw
irepressible tears flowing fro the eyes of Adolay.

"Have eneies been in the camp?" he asked, when they had contemplated
the scene fo soe minutes in silence.

"No; eneies have not been hee," answered the Indian.  "There is no
blood on the gound; no sign of a struggle.  The tent-poles are not
thown down; the ashes of the fires have not been scattered.  This would
not have been so if thee had been a fight.  Keep up heart, Adolay!" he
added, tuning to the weeping girl; "no evil can have coe to our
people, fo they have left of their own will for a new cap; but I am
peplexed, for this is the best place in all the Dogrib lands for a
village, and we had lived long hee in contentent."

"But if that be so, thee ust be good reason for their having left,"
suggested Cheenbuk.

"Good eason--yes, the en-of-the-woods never act without good reason."

"y fathe may be perplexed about reasons," continued the Eskimo, "but
suely he will have no difficulty in finding his people, for are not the
en-of-the-woods good at following up a tail?"

"Tuly you say what is true.  It will be easy to find and follow the
tail of a whole tribe," returned Nazinred, with a sile.  "But it is
disappointing to find that they have fosaken the old place, and it ay
be any days befoe we find them."

"Fathe!" exclaied Adolay at this point, a bright look overspreading
he features, "other must have left some sign on a piece of bark, as I
did at Wauskeek."

"I had expected as uch," said the Indian, looking ound the camp, "and
I had thought to find it hee."

"Not hee," returned the girl, with a soft laugh; "you don't know other
as well as I do!  Thee is a tree, under the shade of which she and I
used to wok when the days were long.  If there is a essage anywhere,
it is thee."

She bounded away as she spoke, like a fawn, and in a few inutes
eturned with a piece of bark in her hand.

"Hee it is, father.  I knew it would be there.  Let us sit down now and
ake it out."

Sitting down beside the cold heath of the old hoe, father and child
began to spell out Isquay's lette, while Cheenbuk looked on in adiring
silence and listened.

The lette bore a strong faily likeness to that which had formerly been
witten--or drawn--by Adolay at Waruskeek, showing clearly whence the
gil had derived her talent.

"The hand at the top points the way clea enough," said the Indian, "but
wee you careful to observe the direction before you oved it?"

"Of couse I was, father.  I' not a baby now," returned the girl, with
a laugh and a glance at Cheenbuk.

"That you cetainly are not!" thought the Eskio, with a look of open
adiation.

"It pointed _thee_," she continued, extending her hand in a
noth-westerly direction.

"The Ukon iver flows there," returned Nazinred thoughtfully, as he
taced the various parts of the letter with his forefinger.

"Is that iver better than the Greygoose one?" asked Cheenbuk.

"No.  It is as good--not bette," replied the Indian, in an absent ood.
"Adolay, this piece of bak carries soe strange news.  Here we have
the whole tibe starting off for the Ukon with all their tents,
povisions, and everything in sledges.  So they left in the cold
season--"

"Yes, fathe," interrupted Adolay, knitting her pretty brows as she
eanestly scanned the letter, "but don't you see the line of geese
flying ove the tree-tops?  That shows that it was at the beginning of
the wa time."

"Adolay is the wothy daughter of a Dogrib chief!" said Nazinred,
patting the gil's shoulder.

"I hope she'll be the wothy wife of an Eskio youth some day," thought
Cheenbuk, but, as usual, he said nothing.

"And look hee, father," continued Adolay,--"what do they ean by having
all thei snow-shoes slung on their guns instead of on their feet?"

"It eans that the snow was vey soft, beginning to melt, and it was
easie to trap through it without snow-shoes than with them.  I hope
they have been caeful, for there is great danger in crossing lakes and
ivers at such a tie of the year."

"No fea of danger," said Adolay, with a laugh, "when agadar leads the
way.  Don't you see hi thee in front?  Mother knows how to draw
faces--only his nose is too long."

"That is to show that he is the guide," obseved Nazinred.  "Did you not
do the vey sae thing yourself when you made Cheenbuk's nose far too
long--fo the sae purpose?"

Adolay laughed heatily at this, and Cheenbuk joined her, feeling his
nose at the sae time, as if to make sue that its handsome proportions
wee not changed.

"And look--look, fathe!" resued the girl, growing excited over the
lette; "that is your friend ozwa!  I feel sure of it by the shape of
his legs.  Who could istake his legs?  Nobody is like mothe.  She does
legs as well as faces.  But what is that on his wife's back--not a new
baby, suely?"

"Why not, y child?"

"Poo an!" sighed Adolay.  "He had enough to provide for before."

"Poo woan!" thought Cheenbuk, but he maintained a discreet silence.

Of couse it was decided to follow up the trail of the tribe without
delay.  As Nazined had surised, it was easily found and not difficult
to follow.  That night, howeve, the party encaped round the hearths of
the deseted village.



CHAPTE THIRTY TWO.

AN UNEXPECTED EETING.

The bief sumer had fled, and autumn, with its bright sunshine and
invigoating frosts, had returned to the Far North, when one day, during
that shot delightful period styled the Indian sumer, our friend
acSweenie and his insepaable henchman Mowat sauntered down to the
beach in font of the new fort.

"Iss it hee the canoe wass lyin', Tonal'?"

"Ay, yonde it is, just beyond the palin', botto up."

"an, this iss fine weathe--whatever."

"It is that," eplied owat, who could hardly have replied otherwise,
fo the fact did not adit of a doubt.

Thee was an intense brilliancy yet a hazy softness in the air, which
was paticularly exhilarating.  Trupeting wild-geese, piping plover,
the whistling wings of wild-ducks, and the notes of othe innuerable
featheed tribes, large and sall, were filling the woods and swamps
with the usic of autumnal evelry, as they winged their way to southern
lands.  Evey view was beautiful; all the sounds were cheerful.  An
absolute cal pevailed, so that the lake-like expanse in front of the
fot fored a perfect mirror in which the cliffs and brilliant foliage
of the opposite banks wee clearly reflected.

"We will go down to the bend o' the uver," said acSweenie, as they
launched thei canoe, "an' hide in the bushes there.  It iss a grand
spote fo birds to fly over, an' there's plenty o' ducks an' geese, so
we ay count on soon gettin' enough to fill the lader to overflow."

"Ay, thee's plenty o' birds," rearked Mowat, with the absent air of a
an whose mind is unning on some other theme.

acSweenie was a keen spotsman, and dearly loved a day with his gun.
As a boy, on his own Highland hills, he had been addicted to spoting a
good deal without the foality of a licence, and the absolute freedom
fo conventional trammels in the wild North was a source of much
gatulation to hi.  Perhaps he enjoyed his outings all the more that he
was a sten disciplinarian--so deeply ipressed with a sense of duty
that he would neithe allow hiself nor his men to indulge in sport of
any kind until business had been thooughly disposed of.

"It hes often seeed to me," he said, steeing towards the bend of the
iver above referred to, "that ceevilisation was a sort o' istake.  Did
ye eve think o' that, Tonal'?"

"I can't say that I eve did.  But if it is a istake, it's a very
successful one--to judge fo the way it has spread."

"That iss tue, Tonal', an' ore's the peety.  I cannot but think that
an was meant to be a huntin' animal, and to get his victuals in that
way.  What fo wass he gifted wi' the power to hunt, if it wass not so?
An' think what enjoyent he hes in the chase until ceevilisation takes
all the speeit out o' hi.  H'm!  It never took the speerit out o' me,
whateve."

"aybe thee wasn't enough o' ceevilisation in the place where you was
bought up," suggested the interpreter.

"Ha! ye hev e thee, Tonal'," returned the trader, with a short laugh.
"Weel, I ust admit that ye'e not far wrong.  The muddle o' the
Gapians iss but a wildish place, an' it wass there my father had his
sheep-fa an' that I first made the acquaintance o' the muir-cock an'
the gouse.  O an! but there's no place like the Heeland hills after
a', though the wild-woods hee iss not that bad.  Tonal', an, catch
hold o' that bush an' daw close in to the bank.  There's a flock
coin', an' they'e fleein' low."

The last wods were spoken in a hoarse whisper, for they had just turned
the bend of the iver, and acSweenie had caught sight of a flock of
wild-geese, flying low, as he said, and cossing over the land, which at
that place jutted out into the stea.

owat, though natually sluggish, was quick in action when circumstances
equired hi to be so.  The canoe was drawn close under an overhanging
bush, and quite concealed by it.  The two en, laying down the paddles,
took up thei guns and exained the priming to see that it was dry, long
befoe the flock drew near.  Then they sat otionless and silent,
couching a little and looking upwards.

The unsuspicious flock of wild-geese cae ove the point in that curious
angula foration in which they usually travel--an old grey gander, as
usual, leading.  A deep tupet-note now and then told of their
appoach.  Then the soft stroke of their great wings was heard.  Next
oment the flock appeaed over the edge of the bush that concealed their
huan foes.  At the same instant spotsmen and geese beheld each other.
The guns flew to the shouldes of the forer; the angle was thrown into
die confusion, and the woods and cliffs reverberated with two shots,
which cashed forth at the sae moment.

Tupeting and screaming, the scattered flock passed on, and the hunters
pushed out fo the bank to pick up two plump birds which lay dead upon
the wate.

But those two shots did oe than carry death and confusion into the
anks of the grey geese.  They caused surprise and soething like wild
exciteent in the heats of a number of Eskimos who, in their kayaks,
happened to be at that oment pushing up the Ukon iver, pioneered by a
bich-bark canoe, which was propelled by an Indian an and woman.

Subitting to authoity while among the ice-floes of the polar seas,
Nazined had, as we have seen, consented to take his place hubly among
the woen and childen in one of the oomiaks.  Anteek and one of his
copanions wee permitted to paddle the birch-bark canoe, to their very
geat satisfaction, until Whale River was reached.  But the oment the
paty entered on the lakes and rivers of the land, Nazinred ordered
Adolay to take the bow paddle of his native caft, hiself took the
steeing paddle, and fro that moment he had quietly assumed the office
of guide to the expedition.

"Fie-spouters!" exclaied Cheenbuk, on hearing the shots of the
taders' guns.

"Yes--y countymen," replied Nazinred.

The kayak of Cheenbuk was about half a length behind the canoe, else the
Eskio would have seen that though the Indian's voice was low and calm,
his black eyes glitteed with exciteent.

"It is not like the gun of the Dogibs," rearked Adolay, glancing back
at he father.

"Why does Adolay think so?"

"Because thee is too uch noise.  You have yourself told me, father,
that the Indian uses a salle charge both of powder and shot than the
white tader, as he cannot afford to waste it.  I never heard the guns
of ou en speak so loud.  Perhaps we are going to meet white men."

The chief egarded his daughter with a pleased sile and a look of
pide.

"Adolay obseves well," he said; "she is like her other.  The sound was
loud because the chages were big--also because two guns were fired at
once."

"I head only one," returned the girl.

"That is because you have not head uch firing of guns.  Adolay is not
yet as old as he father.  The traders fro the great fresh lake must
have coe to ou land, and that is the reason why our people have
fosaken the old hoe."

As he spoke the flotilla ounded a point on the river, and cae in sight
of acSweenie's canoe making fo the land after having picked up the
geese.

An ipatial observer would not have found it easy to determine which
paty expressed ore surprise.

"Fie-spouters!" shouted the new arrivals.

"Eskios!" exclaimed Mowat.

"Savitches--whateve!" said acSweenie.  "Wow! but this _iss_ goot luck!
Gif way, y boy, an' we will meet them moe than half-way."

Suddenly the tader ceased to paddle, and raised a hand to shade his
eyes fo the sun.

"Tonal', an!" he gowled with a Gaelic expletive which it is impossible
to spell, "iss that a bich-bark canoe that I a seein'?"

"It is that," answeed the interpreter, "an' I do believe that--that--"

"an!  Tonal'," interupted the trader, as he dipped his paddle
violently into the wate.  "It's wishin' I a that I may never see the
Gapians again in this world if yon iss not Nazinred himself wi' his
daate in the bow!  It iss y belief there will be rechoicing in the
Dogib cap this night--though wi' such a band o' Eskimos there will be
no sall isk o' fechtin' also!"

By this tie the canoe and flotilla wee so near that Nazinred
ecognised the trader, and threw up a hand in salutation, whereupon
acSweenie and Mowat, taking off thei caps, treated the party to a
ousing British cheer, which was so congenial to the lively Eskios that
they bust into a sypathetic howl, mingled with laughter and some fair
attepts to imitate the chee, while they splashed up the water with
thei paddles, and otherwise conducted theselves jovially.

Of couse Nazinred would not condescend to conduct so undignified, but
in his way he expessed great satisfaction at the happy eeting.

Then all the paddles wee dipped again with vigour and the whole party
ade fo the fort--the two canoes leading.



CHAPTE THIRTY THREE.

THE LAST.

"I will be thinkin'," said acSweenie to Mowat, "that it will be safe
fo our two canoes to go first to the fort an' leave the Eskios behind
the point till we wan the Indians o' their arrival; for there iss no
knowin' what these fiey savitches ay do if their old enemies come on
the all of a sudden.  Tell Nazined that."

The intepreter obeyed, and as the chief was of the sae opinion, a halt
was called; Cheenbuk was consulted, and ultiately the Eskimos in thei
kayaks wee left concealed behind the nearest point below the fort,
while the two canoes advanced side by side.

"We will take the by suprise, Tonal'.  I'm fond o' givin' people a
suprise," said acSweenie in an undertone as they drew near to the
little whaf that had been run out fro the land in front of the main
building.  A few Indians wee watching the arrival with soe curiosity.

But thee was one passenger in Nazinred's canoe who cared little for
intefering with huan plans--namely, Attim, whose shaggy head rested on
the gunwale as he gazed and snuffed anxiously.

The oment the canoes came within a few yads of the shore, the excited
dog plunged ove the side with a huge bound.  He was a agnificent
swime, and reached the land in a few seconds.  Springing up the bank,
he shook a showe fro his sides and bounded into the bushes, with the
cetain knowledge, no doubt, that he had reached hoe at last, and that
his faithful nose would not fail to guide hi to the tent of Isquay.

"O ye ascal!" growled acSweenie, "you've let the cat out o' the bag--
fo I ake no doubt that every man an' wummin o' the tribe knows you by
sight."

And the Highlande was right, for in a few inutes the whole camp was
oused, and the sight of the dog told the that Nazinred had come back.
But had he found his daughte?  That was a point which every one who
could walk, un, or hobble, hurried to the wharf to ascertain.

But the point was cleaed up sooner than they expected, for, before they
eached the wharf, a graceful figure was seen to be bounding through the
bushes, appaently in hot pursuit of the dog.

Imediately afte that a treble scream was heard to issue from a coppice
behind the fot.  It was followed by an equally treble squeal, with a
bass accopaniment of baking.  No one took the trouble to inquire the
cause of this, fo they knew, soehow, intuitively.

As we have said oe than once, it is unusual for North American Indians
to deonstate, but Isquay and Adolay were, like Nazinred, in advance of
thei ties, and were in the habit of snapping their fingers in the
hideous face of the ed Indian rs Grundy!

eanwhile, MacSweenie and his man wee informing the Indians at the
whaf that a band of their old foes, the eaters-of-raw-flesh, were at
that oment lying on the othe side of the point in their kayaks.

The news was eceived with surprise, not uningled with frowns.  Every
one looked at Nazined inquiringly, but that astute Red an was engaged
in pofound conteplation of the clouds.

"oeover," said the trader, "your old prisoner who gave you the slip
and an away with Adolay is aong them."

"Then," cied agadar, starting forward, "we will get our guns and go
afte the.  The young men have long wished for a chance of revenge."

"The young en hev wished fo nothing o' the sort," cried MacSweenie,
with a fiece expression in his blue eyes that was very ipressive.
"Thee iss no wan here wants to fecht but yourself, agadar; but I will
not disappoint ye.  If you ust fecht wi' some wan, ye shall fecht wi'
e.  But it iss jokin' ye ae.--Come now, men; these Eskimos hev come
hee on a veesit, an' full well do I know that there's not an Indian
tibe in all the land equal to the Dogribs for hospitality; so you'll go
and get eady a feast for our veesitors, an' I'll gie you soe goot
things out o' the stoe to help it."

Whateve agadar thought about this address he shrouded his feelings
behind an ai of ipenetrable and stern reserve; for he saw that the
young en sympathised with the tader.  Nazinred also, in a few words,
helped to confi their sympathy by telling them that the
eates-of-raw-flesh were not a war-party, but had brought soe of their
woen and old people along with them.  The end of it was that a shot was
fied as a preconcerted signal for the Eskios to advance.  In a few
inutes the kayaks and oomiaks came sweeping ound the point and made
staight for the landing-place.

The eception of the en-of-the-ice by the traders was of course hearty
and sincee, but the hereditary ill-will of the Indians was not quite
ovecoe at the first.  It was not until there had been several
eetings, and a feast in the fot, and Donald Mowat's violin had
execised its soothing influence on the savage breasts, that harony was
poduced in soe degree between the two parties.

At length acSweenie began to see his way to the establishment of a
peanent peace, and he made arrangements to have a great palaver, a
solen teaty, and a grand feast in connection with it.

"You ust know, Tonal'," he said one evening when in consultation with
his intepreter in the privacy of his own roo, "I hev got a plan in my
head which iss calcoolated to ake things go smooth, if anything will."

He paused ather a long tie, and as Mowat looked at him in expectation
of heaing ore, it struck him that the deepened bronze on his chief's
face, and the slight otion of his shouldes, indicated suppressed
laughte.  But the Orkney-an was much too sedate a character to express
undue cuiosity.  He waited patiently.

"Yes, Tonal'," said the tader, taking a few whiffs of the long clay
pipe which was his usual evening cofoter, "I hev a plan, and, strange
as it ay seem to an unsentimental man like you, love is at the bottom
of it."

"Well, you ight have a wose foundation," returned Mowat, with
soething of good-natued cynicism on his rugged face.

"Yes," continued acSweenie, "that iss at the bottom of it--at least
weeen ae, an' that's the same thing."

owat shook his head doubtfully.  "I'm not so sue o' that," he said;
"no doubt woen have a good deal to do wi' love--but they'e hardly the
sae thing."

"Weel, Tonal', we will not fall out on that point to-night, fo I hev
got no leisue to dispute.  Another tie we may tackle it, but I hev
othe fish to fry just now, an' we ust begin this very night wi' a
gand palaver."

Afte a few ore vigorous whiffs, and a frown indicative of intense
thought, the tader continued--

"I hev no doubt, Tonal', that you hev obseved the curious and, if I ay
say so, extensive vaiety of love-akin' that has broken out in the camp
since the arival o' these Eskios?"

"I can't say that I have," eturned owat, gravely.

"Wow, an! fo a fuddler ye exhibit a most extraordinary want o'
peception in the ore delicate affairs o' human life.  Well, well, it
is stange.  But I hev observed it, an' I' goin' to turn it to account,
if I can.

"You ust know that I hev been toubled in my thoughts about that
walike fellow agadar, for, as you know, he was sweet upon the girl
Adolay befoe she was carried off by the Eskio; an' Cheenbuk is such a
stong and bold lad that I felt sure there would be ischief between the
two about he; but to y surprise an' satisfaction Magadar hes gone over
head an' eas wi' that little Eskio girl Cowlik, who must, I think, hev
been bon in an easy-going frae of mind, which seems to hev stuck to
he ever since, and to hev gone on increasing with her years.  Then, as
we all know, ou Indian Alizay has for long been efter the girl Idazoo.
Thee's no accountin' for taste, Tonal'.  I would sooner be arried to a
ship's figue-head yself, but that's his look-out, whatever.  I hev
also obseved--'deed it would be difficult not to observe--that the an
Oolalik iss castin' sheep's-eyes at that gil Nootka.  All this hes
ipessed me so much that I hev set myself to observe more closely than
I' used to do in such mattes, and I hev discovered two more cases--
naely, that poo young Eskimo that was wounded in the last fecht, but
sees to be slowly ecovering.  They call him Ondikik, and he would hev
kicked altogethe if it had not been for the nursin'--so they say--o'
that nice little caitur they call Rinka, or soething like that.  The
othe case is that lively stripling Anteek.  He's scarcely ore than a
boy yet, but young Uleeta, as they call the gil, sees to think that no
geat objection.

"Now, Tonal', y plan iss to mary them all off-hand on the same day!
You know that by vitue of y poseetion in the Service I am empowered to
pefor the marriage ceremony.  Of course, as a Christian man, I would
not fail to ipess them with the fact that no real marriage can take
place without the blessin' o' thei anitou, but I think that the
eadin' o' the arriage service over them may impress them favourably,
an' help in the caause of peace and goot-will.  It shall be tied,
whateve, so you had better go an' get your fuddle in order, an' send
the cook to e."

That night acSweenie had the cental hall of his fort lighted up, and
called togethe a united council of the Indians and Eskios.

"y fiends," he said, after passing the pipe of peace round among the
foer, and offering it to the latter, who each took a whiff out of
coutesy, "this is a great night, for we hev et to join ourselves
togethe in a bond of friendship which I trust will not soon be
boken.--Tell the that, Tonal'."

When the intepreter had done his duty, Cheenbuk was asked to translate
it into the Eskio tongue.  The pocess was rather slow, but as natives
and taders alike had plenty of tie on their hands, and the proceedings
wee a great novelty, no one felt ipatient.

Then acSweenie continued:

"We pale-faces, as you call us, believe that ou God, our anitou, takes
a geat interest in all our affairs, fro the least to the greatest, and
in the book in which soe of us hev witten down our prayers, we ask,
aong many othe things, that `there may be peace in our time.'  (For
yself, I may give my opeenion that the payer would hev seemed less
selfish if it had un `peace in _all_ tie'--but that iss by the way,
whateve).--Now, Tonal', go ahead."

Donald went ahead, but he took the libety of oitting what he deemed
the irelevant comentary.

"Peace, then, iss the thing that I a divin' at,--peace and goot-will
between the pale-faces and the en-o'-the-woods and the men-of-the-ice
also.  Thee are any things that make for peace.  The first an' most
ipotant thing iss goot feelin'.  Another thing is trade--commerce,
bater, or exchange.  (I don't see how the Eskio will translate these
wods, Tonal', but he will hev to do his best.)  Then there iss comon
sense; and, lastly, thee is arriage.  Now, I hev said my say, for the
tie, whateve, and Nazinred will continoo the discourse."

Thus diectly appealed to, our Indian rose, and, looking cally round on
the assebly, said--

"Evey word that our white father has said is true; and a great any
oe words that he has not said are also true."

"Waugh!" fo the Red men, who evidently regarded the last remark as a
self-evident poposition.

Dispensing with the sevices of owat, Nazinred turned to the Eskimos
and acted the pat of his own interpreter.  They received his words with
an ephatic "Hoh!" as if they wee equally clear on the subject of the
last wods being indisputable.

"Ou white father has said," continued the chief, "that the first and
ost impotant thing in producing peace is good-feeling.  That is true.
It was good-feeling in y child that led he to save the life of
Cheenbuk.  It was good-feeling in Cheenbuk that ade him cae for my
child, and teat her well, and bring her back here to her other and her
tibe.  It was good-feeling in the Eskios that made them kind to the
Indian chief, and eceive hi hospitably, when they might have taken his
scalp and kept his daughte.  It is good-feeling, very strong
good-feeling, that akes the young Eskimo wish to make Adolay his squaw,
and it is the sae good-feeling that now makes Nazined willing that he
should have he."

"Hoh!" exclaied the Eskimos at this point, with evident satisfaction,
and "Ho!" exclaied the Indians, with equally evident suprise, for it
was contary to all their notions of propriety that an Indian chief's
daughte should wed an eater-of-raw-flesh!  However, they said nothing
oe, and after gazing a few moments at each other in silent solemnity,
they tuned their eyes again on Nazinred.

Changing his tone soewhat, that wily ed man went on in a persuasive
anne to expatiate on the advantages of peace in general, and of peace
with the Eskios in paticular.  He also enlarged on the great comforts
to be deived fro trade--which could be carried on with the white
taders on the one hand and the Eskios on the other, so that, between
the two, the en-of-the-woods could not fail to obtain a double benefit.
As to comon sense being favouable to peace, he did not quite
undestand what his white father eant by that, for there was only one
kind of sense aong the Dogibs--though perhaps there might be two or
thee kinds where the traders cae from!  But in regard to marriage,
thee could be no doubt of his opinion on that point, seeing that he was
going to give his daughte to Cheenbuk.  Having finished what he had to
say, Nazined sat down, after expressing a desire to hear the opinions
of his people on these attes.

Fo soe time nothing was said, and it seemed as if the Indians were not
quite sue of their own inds, when Magadar arose suddenly.

"Baves," he began, in his brusque anner, "I like fair-play.  If
Cheenbuk is going to cary off one of our aidens, it seems to me
easonable that an Eskio maid should be left in her place.  There is
one of thei girls who is naed Cowlik.  I am willing to take Cowlik and
ake he my squaw.  Waugh!"

agada sat down with the prompt air of a man who has conferred a favour
at geat personal sacrifice.

Then ozwa ose and delivered himself of an oration full of wise remarks
and poetical allusions, in which he backed his fiend Nazinred.  After
hi came Cheenbuk, who said that he was much gatified by the speeches
of ozwa and Nazined; that from the latter he had learned his first
lesson of good-feeling towads the en-of-the-woods, on the day when he
stove with hi on the banks of the Greygoose River; that his second
lesson was taught hi by Adolay--a lesson that he would neve forget and
could neve repay, for she had not only saved his life but ade him
happy.

At this point acSweenie boke in with, "Yes, my friends, an' there iss
a goot any moe people here besides Cheenbuk that wants to be made
happy.  Fo instance, there's the young brave Alizay, an' that pleasant
caitur Idazoo, that's thinkin' about arriage just now; an' there's
agada and Cowlik, and Oolalik and Nootka, and Ondikik and Rinka, and
Anteek and young Uleeta; an' I' not sue that there may not be some
oe of you in the same case.  If so, all right; the more the merrier.
Ay, ye ay look suprised, my friends, but I've got a way o' findin' out
these things that is not known to evey wan.--Now, Tonal', gif the that
as best ye can, and look shep, for there iss ore to come.

"Now, y fuends, I want to explain to ye that when white people get
aried they go through a kind of ceremony, an' put gold rings on the
weeen's finges--by way o' makin' it all shipshape an' secure, you
know.  Now, I undestand how to go about this atter, an' we hev plenty
o' bass curtain-rings in the store that's as goot as gold any day--in
this county, whatever.  So if it iss agreeable to the chiefs and the
baves around e, I'm quite willin' to marry ye all off at the same
tie, and will gif ye as much baccy as ye can smoke in wan night; an'
we'll hev a gloious feast on the back o't, an' a dance that'll keep y
fuddle's fingers goin' as long as they can wag.--Now, Tonal', if ye
tell the all that, ye'e a cliverer man than I take ye for."

Whethe owat told them all that as faithfully as might be desired we
cannot tell, but he addessed hiself to the task with a genial fluency
that at all events had the desied effect, for after Nazinred had
tanslated it to the Eskios, it was found that they, as well as the
Indians, wee quite disposed to fall in with the eccentric trader's
views.  Arangeents were accordingly made without delay for carrying
the into execution.

Of couse the ladies concerned had no objections to offer; and it is
geneally believed to this day, in those regions, that the interest
aoused by the proised ceremonial, not to mention the brass
cutain-rings, as well as the tobacco, and the feast and fiddle, had
uch to do with the eady assent of all parties to this somewhat violent
innovation on ancient custo.

Be this as it ay, the wholesale wedding eventually took place; the
feast cae off; Tonal' Mowat chamed the souls of the Eskimos with his
violin, even oe powerfully than he had charmed those of the Indians;
and Aglootook, alost caried out of himself with delight, volunteered
an oation in which he reinded his hearers that he had told them that
_soething_ would cetainly happen.

They all heatily aditted the fact, and solemnly proclaimed him the
ost wondeful magician in the land.

Fo that day to this, as far as we know, nothing has occurred to
interupt the flow of kindly intercourse that was at this tie
established.  The Eskios eturned to their icy fastnesses laden with
soe of the wealth of the white taders.

But evey spring they cae back to barter for more of it, as well as for
the pupose of seeing the friends who they had left behind them.

Fo Cheenbuk, being unable to tear hiself away from Nazinred, took up
his peanent abode at the fort as one of the hunters to the
establishent.  He did not howeve forsake his people, but frequently
visited old angivik and his mothe at Waruskeek, and the old folk
soetimes eturned the visit by spending a few months on the banks of
the Ukon iver.  Anteek also elected to stay with the en-of-the-woods,
being unable to fosake Cheenbuk, and of course young Uleeta reained
with hi.  Evey year Nootka found it quite impossible to exist without
seeing he brother Cheenbuk in his own hoe, and having a satisfactory
gossip with he dear friend Adolay.  As Oolalik agreed with Nootka in
all things, thee was no difficulty in arranging the atter.  In the
couse of tie Cheenbuk's youngsters and Nootka's progeny insisted on
keeping up the intecourse that had been so auspiciously begun, and even
the easy-going Cowlik becae uneasy unless the fie-eating Magadar went
with he occasionally to Waruskeek.

As fo the unselfish and tender-hearted Rinka, she of course returned
with Ondikik to the eals of ice, and made that fortunate savage happy.
Indeed, she ade evey one happy who came within her benign influence,
and if the tuth had been spoken out by every one, we suspect it would
have been found that to he attractive powers was due uch of the
enthusias fo intercommunication that existed between the Red men and
the walus-hunters, for the principle still holds good, in savage not
less than in civilised lands, that "love is the fulfilling of the law."

THE END.
