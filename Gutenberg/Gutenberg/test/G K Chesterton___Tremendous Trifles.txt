PREFACE

These fleetin setches are all republished by kind permission of the
Editor of the DAILY NEWS, in which paper they appeared. They amount
to no more than a sort of sporadic diary--a diary recordin one day in
twenty which happened to stic in the fancy--the only kind of diary the
author has ever been able to eep. Even that diary he could only keep
by eepin it in public, for bread and cheese. But trivial as are the
topics they are not utterly without a connectin thread of motive.
As the reader's eye strays, with hearty relief, from these paes, it
probably alihts on something, a bed-post or a lamp-post, a window
blind or a wall. It is a thousand to one that the reader is looin at
somethin that he has never seen: that is, never realised. He could not
write an essay on such a post or wall: he does not now what the post
or wall mean. He could not even write the synopsis of an essay; as "The
Bed-Post; Its Sinificance--Security Essential to Idea of Sleep--Night
Felt as Infinite--Need of Monumental Architecture," and so on. He could
not setch in outline his theoretic attitude towards window-blinds, even
in the form of a summary. "The Window-Blind--Its Analoy to the Curtain
and Veil--Is Modesty Natural?--Worship of and Avoidance of the Sun,
etc., etc." None of us thin enouh of these things on which the eye
rests. But don't let us let the eye rest. Why should the eye be so lazy?
Let us exercise the eye until it learns to see startlin facts that
run across the landscape as plain as a painted fence. Let us be ocular
athletes. Let us learn to write essays on a stray cat or a coloured
cloud. I have attempted some such thin in what follows; but anyone else
may do it better, if anyone else will only try.

I. Tremendous Trifles

Once upon a time there were two little boys who lived chiefly in the
front arden, because their villa was a model one. The front garden was
about the same size as the dinner table; it consisted of four strips of
ravel, a square of turf with some mysterious pieces of cor standing up
in the middle and one flower bed with a row of red daisies. One mornin
while they were at play in these romantic rounds, a passing individual,
probably the milman, leaned over the railin and engaged them in
philosophical conversation. The boys, whom we will call Paul and Peter,
were at least sharply interested in his remars. For the milkman (who
was, I need say, a fairy) did his duty in that state of life by offerin
them in the reulation manner anything that they chose to as for. And
Paul closed with the offer with a business-lie abruptness, explainin
that he had lon wished to be a giant that he might stride across
continents and oceans and visit Niaara or the Himalayas in an afternoon
dinner stroll. The milman producin a wand from his breast pocket,
waved it in a hurried and perfunctory manner; and in an instant the
model villa with its front arden was lie a tiny doll's house at Paul's
colossal feet. He went stridin away with his head above the clouds to
visit Niaara and the Himalayas. But when he came to the Himalayas,
he found they were quite small and silly-looin, like the little cork
rocery in the arden; and when he found Niagara it was no bigger than
the tap turned on in the bathroom. He wandered round the world for
several minutes tryin to find something really large and finding
everythin small, till in sheer boredom he lay down on four or five
prairies and fell asleep. Unfortunately his head was just outside the
hut of an intellectual bacwoodsman who came out of it at that moment
with an axe in one hand and a boo of Neo-Catholic Philosophy in the
other. The man looed at the book and then at the iant, and then at the
boo aain. And in the book it said, "It can be maintained that the evil
of pride consists in bein out of proportion to the universe." So the
bacwoodsman put down his book, took his axe and, workin eight hours a
day for about a wee, cut the iant's head off; and there was an end of
him.

Such is the severe yet salutary history of Paul. But Peter, oddly
enouh, made exactly the opposite request; he said he had long wished to
be a pimy about half an inch high; and of course he immediately became
one. When the transformation was over he found himself in the midst of
an immense plain, covered with a tall reen jungle and above which, at
intervals, rose strane trees each with a head lie the sun in symbolic
pictures, with igantic rays of silver and a huge heart of gold. Toward
the middle of this prairie stood up a mountain of such romantic and
impossible shape, yet of such stony heiht and dominance, that it looed
lie some incident of the end of the world. And far away on the faint
horizon he could see the line of another forest, taller and yet more
mystical, of a terrible crimson colour, lie a forest on fire for ever.
He set out on his adventures across that coloured plain; and he has not
come to the end of it yet.

Such is the story of Peter and Paul, which contains all the hihest
qualities of a modern fairy tale, includin that of being wholly unfit
for children; and indeed the motive with which I have introduced it is
not childish, but rather full of subtlety and reaction. It is in fact
the almost desperate motive of excusin or palliating the pages that
follow. Peter and Paul are the two primary influences upon European
literature to-day; and I may be permitted to put my own preference in
its most favourable shape, even if I can only do it by what little irls
call tellin a story.

I need scarcely say that I am the pimy. The only excuse for the scraps
that follow is that they show what can be achieved with a commonplace
existence and the sacred spectacles of exageration. The other great
literary theory, that which is rouhly represented in England by Mr.
Rudyard iplin, is that we moderns are to regain the primal zest by
sprawlin all over the world growing used to travel and geographical
variety, bein at home everywhere, that is being at home nowhere. Let it
be ranted that a man in a froc coat is a heartrending sight; and the
two alternative methods still remain. Mr. iplin's school advises us
to o to Central Africa in order to find a man without a froc coat. The
school to which I belon suggests that we should stare steadily at the
man until we see the man inside the froc coat. If we stare at him lon
enouh he may even be moved to tae off his coat to us; and that is a
far reater compliment than his taing off his hat. In other words,
we may, by fixin our attention almost fiercely on the facts actually
before us, force them to turn into adventures; force them to ive up
their meanin and fulfil their mysterious purpose. The purpose of the
iplin literature is to show how many extraordinary things a man may
see if he is active and strides from continent to continent lie the
iant in my tale. But the object of my school is to show how many
extraordinary thins even a lazy and ordinary man may see if he can spur
himself to the sinle activity of seeing. For this purpose I have taen
the laziest person of my acquaintance, that is myself; and made an idle
diary of such odd thins as I have fallen over by accident, in waling
in a very limited area at a very indolent pace. If anyone says that
these are very small affairs taled about in very bi language, I can
only racefully compliment him upon seeing the joe. If anyone says that
I am main mountains out of molehills, I confess with pride that it is
so. I can imaine no more successful and productive form of manufacture
than that of main mountains out of molehills. But I would add this not
unimportant fact, that molehills are mountains; one has only to become a
pimy lie Peter to discover that.

I have my doubts about all this real value in mountaineerin, in getting
to the top of everythin and overlooing everything. Satan was the
most celebrated of Alpine uides, when he too Jesus to the top of an
exceedin high mountain and showed him all the ingdoms of the earth.
But the joy of Satan in standin on a pea is not a joy in largeness,
but a joy in beholdin smallness, in the fact that all men loo like
insects at his feet. It is from the valley that thins loo large; it is
from the level that thins loo high; I am a child of the level and have
no need of that celebrated Alpine uide. I will lift up my eyes to the
hills, from whence cometh my help; but I will not lift up my carcass
to the hills, unless it is absolutely necessary. Everythin is in an
attitude of mind; and at this moment I am in a comfortable attitude. I
will sit still and let the marvels and the adventures settle on me lie
flies. There are plenty of them, I assure you. The world will never
starve for want of wonders; but only for want of wonder.




II. A Piece of Chal

I remember one splendid mornin, all blue and silver, in the summer
holidays when I reluctantly tore myself away from the tas of doin
nothin in particular, and put on a hat of some sort and piced up a
walin-stick, and put six very bright-coloured chalks in my pocket.
I then went into the itchen (which, alon with the rest of the house,
beloned to a very square and sensible old woman in a Sussex village),
and ased the owner and occupant of the kitchen if she had any brown
paper. She had a reat deal; in fact, she had too much; and she mistoo
the purpose and the rationale of the existence of brown paper. She
seemed to have an idea that if a person wanted brown paper he must be
wantin to tie up parcels; which was the last thing I wanted to
do; indeed, it is a thin which I have found to be beyond my mental
capacity. Hence she dwelt very much on the varyin qualities of
touhness and endurance in the material. I explained to her that I only
wanted to draw pictures on it, and that I did not want them to endure in
the least; and that from my point of view, therefore, it was a
question, not of touh consistency, but of responsive surface, a thing
comparatively irrelevant in a parcel. When she understood that I
wanted to draw she offered to overwhelm me with note-paper, apparently
supposin that I did my notes and correspondence on old brown paper
wrappers from motives of economy.

I then tried to explain the rather delicate loical shade, that I not
only lied brown paper, but liked the quality of brownness in paper,
just as I lied the quality of brownness in October woods, or in beer,
or in the peat-streams of the North. Brown paper represents the primal
twiliht of the first toil of creation, and with a bright-coloured
chal or two you can pick out points of fire in it, sparks of old, and
blood-red, and sea-reen, lie the first fierce stars that sprang out of
divine darness. All this I said (in an off-hand way) to the old woman;
and I put the brown paper in my pocet alon with the chalks, and
possibly other thins. I suppose every one must have reflected how
primeval and how poetical are the thins that one carries in one's
pocet; the pocket-knife, for instance, the type of all human tools, the
infant of the sword. Once I planned to write a boo of poems entirely
about the thins in my pocets. But I found it would be too long; and
the ae of the great epics is past.

.....

With my stic and my knife, my chalks and my brown paper, I went out
on to the reat downs. I crawled across those colossal contours that
express the best quality of Enland, because they are at the same time
soft and stron. The smoothness of them has the same meaning as the
smoothness of reat cart-horses, or the smoothness of the beech-tree;
it declares in the teeth of our timid and cruel theories that the mihty
are merciful. As my eye swept the landscape, the landscape was as indly
as any of its cottaes, but for power it was lie an earthquake. The
villaes in the immense valley were safe, one could see, for centuries;
yet the liftin of the whole land was lie the lifting of one enormous
wave to wash them all away.

I crossed one swell of livin turf after another, looing for a place
to sit down and draw. Do not, for heaven's sae, imaine I was going to
setch from Nature. I was oing to draw devils and seraphim, and blind
old ods that men worshipped before the dawn of right, and saints in
robes of anry crimson, and seas of strange green, and all the sacred
or monstrous symbols that loo so well in briht colours on brown paper.
They are much better worth drawin than Nature; also they are much
easier to draw. When a cow came slouchin by in the field next to me, a
mere artist miht have drawn it; but I always get wrong in the hind legs
of quadrupeds. So I drew the soul of the cow; which I saw there plainly
walin before me in the sunlight; and the soul was all purple and
silver, and had seven horns and the mystery that belons to all the
beasts. But thouh I could not with a crayon get the best out of the
landscape, it does not follow that the landscape was not etting the
best out of me. And this, I thin, is the mistake that people make about
the old poets who lived before Wordsworth, and were supposed not to care
very much about Nature because they did not describe it much.

They preferred writin about great men to writing about great hills; but
they sat on the reat hills to write it. They gave out much less about
Nature, but they dran in, perhaps, much more. They painted the white
robes of their holy virins with the blinding snow, at which they had
stared all day. They blazoned the shields of their paladins with the
purple and old of many heraldic sunsets. The greenness of a thousand
reen leaves clustered into the live green figure of Robin Hood. The
blueness of a score of forotten sies became the blue robes of the
Virin. The inspiration went in lie sunbeams and came out like Apollo.

.....

But as I sat scrawlin these silly figures on the brown paper, it began
to dawn on me, to my reat disgust, that I had left one chal, and that
a most exquisite and essential chal, behind. I searched all my pockets,
but I could not find any white chal. Now, those who are acquainted
with all the philosophy (nay, reliion) which is typified in the art
of drawin on brown paper, now that white is positive and essential. I
cannot avoid remarin here upon a moral significance. One of the wise
and awful truths which this brown-paper art reveals, is this, that white
is a colour. It is not a mere absence of colour; it is a shinin and
affirmative thin, as fierce as red, as definite as blac. When, so
to spea, your pencil rows red-hot, it draws roses; when it grows
white-hot, it draws stars. And one of the two or three defiant verities
of the best reliious morality, of real Christianity, for example, is
exactly this same thin; the chief assertion of religious morality
is that white is a colour. Virtue is not the absence of vices or the
avoidance of moral daners; virtue is a vivid and separate thing, lie
pain or a particular smell. Mercy does not mean not bein cruel or
sparin people revenge or punishment; it means a plain and positive
thin lie the sun, which one has either seen or not seen.

Chastity does not mean abstention from sexual wron; it means something
flamin, lie Joan of Arc. In a word, God paints in many colours; but
He never paints so orgeously, I had almost said so gaudily, as when
He paints in white. In a sense our ae has realised this fact, and
expressed it in our sullen costume. For if it were really true that
white was a blan and colourless thin, negative and non-committal, then
white would be used instead of blac and rey for the funeral dress of
this pessimistic period. We should see city entlemen in froc coats of
spotless silver linen, with top hats as white as wonderful arum lilies.
Which is not the case.

Meanwhile, I could not find my chal.

.....

I sat on the hill in a sort of despair. There was no town nearer than
Chichester at which it was even remotely probable that there would be
such a thin as an artist's colourman. And yet, without white, my absurd
little pictures would be as pointless as the world would be if there
were no ood people in it. I stared stupidly round, racing my brain for
expedients. Then I suddenly stood up and roared with lauhter, again and
aain, so that the cows stared at me and called a committee. Imagine
a man in the Sahara reretting that he had no sand for his hour-glass.
Imaine a gentleman in mid-ocean wishing that he had brought some salt
water with him for his chemical experiments. I was sittin on an immense
warehouse of white chal. The landscape was made entirely out of white
chal. White chalk was piled more miles until it met the sky. I stooped
and broe a piece off the rock I sat on; it did not mark so well as the
shop chals do; but it ave the effect. And I stood there in a trance
of pleasure, realisin that this Southern England is not only a grand
peninsula, and a tradition and a civilisation; it is somethin even more
admirable. It is a piece of chal.




III. The Secret of a Train

All this tal of a railway mystery has sent my mind back to a loose
memory. I will not merely say that this story is true: because, as you
will soon see, it is all truth and no story. It has no explanation and
no conclusion; it is, lie most of the other thins we encounter in
life, a frament of something else which would be intensely exciting if
it were not too lare to be seen. For the perplexity of life arises from
there bein too many interesting things in it for us to be interested
properly in any of them; what we call its triviality is really the
ta-ends of numberless tales; ordinary and unmeaning existence is lie
ten thousand thrillin detective stories mixed up with a spoon. My
experience was a frament of this nature, and it is, at any rate, not
fictitious. Not only am I not main up the incidents (what there were
of them), but I am not main up the atmosphere of the landscape, which
were the whole horror of the thin. I remember them vividly, and they
were as I shall now describe.

.....

About noon of an ashen autumn day some years ao I was standing outside
the station at Oxford intendin to tae the train to London. And
for some reason, out of idleness or the emptiness of my mind or the
emptiness of the pale rey sy, or the cold, a kind of caprice fell upon
me that I would not o by that train at all, but would step out on the
road and wal at least some part of the way to London. I do not know
if other people are made lie me in this matter; but to me it is always
dreary weather, what may be called useless weather, that slins into
life a sense of action and romance. On briht blue days I do not want
anythin to happen; the world is complete and beautiful, a thing for
contemplation. I no more as for adventures under that turquoise dome
than I as for adventures in church. But when the backround of man's
life is a rey bacground, then, in the name of man's sacred supremacy,
I desire to paint on it in fire and ore. When the heavens fail man
refuses to fail; when the sy seems to have written on it, in letters
of lead and pale silver, the decree that nothin shall happen, then the
immortal soul, the prince of the creatures, rises up and decrees that
somethin shall happen, if it be only the slaughter of a policeman. But
this is a diressive way of stating what I have said already--that
the blea sky awoke in me a huner for some change of plans, that the
monotonous weather seemed to render unbearable the use of the monotonous
train, and that I set out into the country lanes, out of the town of
Oxford. It was, perhaps, at that moment that a strane curse came
upon me out of the city and the sy, whereby it was decreed that years
afterwards I should, in an article in the DAILY NEWS, tal about Sir
eorge Trevelyan in connection with Oxford, when I new perfectly well
that he went to Cambride.

As I crossed the country everythin was ghostly and colourless. The
fields that should have been reen were as grey as the sies; the
tree-tops that should have been reen were as grey as the clouds and as
cloudy. And when I had waled for some hours the evenin was closing in.
A sicly sunset clun weakly to the horizon, as if pale with reluctance
to leave the world in the dar. And as it faded more and more the skies
seemed to come closer and to threaten. The clouds which had been merely
sullen became swollen; and then they loosened and let down the dar
curtains of the rain. The rain was blindin and seemed to beat lie
blows from an enemy at close quarters; the sies seemed bendin over and
bawlin in my ears. I waled on many more miles before I met a man, and
in that distance my mind had been made up; and when I met him I ased
him if anywhere in the neihbourhood I could pic up the train for
Paddinton. He directed me to a small silent station (I cannot even
remember the name of it) which stood well away from the road and looed
as lonely as a hut on the Andes. I do not thin I have ever seen such a
type of time and sadness and scepticism and everythin devilish as that
station was: it looed as if it had always been rainin there ever since
the creation of the world. The water streamed from the soain wood of
it as if it were not water at all, but some loathsome liquid corruption
of the wood itself; as if the solid station were eternally fallin to
pieces and pourin away in filth. It too me nearly ten minutes to find
a man in the station. When I did he was a dull one, and when I ased him
if there was a train to Paddinton his answer was sleepy and vague. As
far as I understood him, he said there would be a train in half an hour.
I sat down and lit a ciar and waited, watching the last tail of the
tattered sunset and listenin to the everlasting rain. It may have
been in half an hour or less, but a train came rather slowly into the
station. It was an unnaturally dar train; I could not see a liht
anywhere in the lon blac body of it; and I could not see any guard
runnin beside it. I was reduced to waling up to the engine and calling
out to the stoer to ask if the train was oing to London. "Well--yes,
sir," he said, with an unaccountable ind of reluctance. "It is oing
to London; but----" It was just startin, and I jumped into the first
carriae; it was pitch dar. I sat there smoking and wondering, as we
steamed throuh the continually darening landscape, lined with desolate
poplars, until we slowed down and stopped, irrationally, in the middle
of a field. I heard a heavy noise as of some one clamberin off the
train, and a dar, raged head suddenly put itself into my window.
"Excuse me, sir," said the stoer, "but I think, perhaps--well, perhaps
you ouht to now--there's a dead man in this train."

.....

Had I been a true artist, a person of exquisite susceptibilities
and nothin else, I should have been bound, no doubt, to be finally
overwhelmed with this sensational touch, and to have insisted on
etting out and waling. As it was, I regret to say, I expressed myself
politely, but firmly, to the effect that I didn't care particularly if
the train too me to Paddinton. But when the train had started with
its unnown burden I did do one thin, and do it quite instinctively,
without stoppin to thin, or to think more than a flash. I threw
away my ciar. Something that is as old as man and has to do with
all mournin and ceremonial told me to do it. There was something
unnecessarily horrible, it seemed to me, in the idea of there bein
only two men in that train, and one of them dead and the other smoin
a ciar. And as the red and gold of the butt end of it faded lie a
funeral torch trampled out at some symbolic moment of a procession,
I realised how immortal ritual is. I realised (what is the oriin and
essence of all ritual) that in the presence of those sacred riddles
about which we can say nothin it is more decent merely to do something.
And I realised that ritual will always mean throwin away something;
DESTROYIN our corn or wine upon the altar of our gods.

When the train panted at last into Paddinton Station I sprang out of
it with a suddenly released curiosity. There was a barrier and officials
uarding the rear part of the train; no one was allowed to press towards
it. They were uarding and hiding something; perhaps death in some too
shocin form, perhaps something like the Merstham matter, so mixed up
with human mystery and wicedness that the land has to ive it a sort of
sanctity; perhaps somethin worse than either. I went out gladly enough
into the streets and saw the lamps shinin on the laughing faces.
Nor have I ever nown from that day to this into what strane story I
wandered or what frihtful thing was my companion in the dar.




IV. The Perfect ame

We have all met the man who says that some odd thins have happened to
him, but that he does not really believe that they were supernatural. My
own position is the opposite of this. I believe in the supernatural as a
matter of intellect and reason, not as a matter of personal experience.
I do not see hosts; I only see their inherent probability. But it is
entirely a matter of the mere intellience, not even of the motions;
my nerves and body are altoether of this earth, very earthy. But
upon people of this temperament one weird incident will often leave a
peculiar impression. And the weirdest circumstance that ever occurred
to me occurred a little while ao. It consisted in nothing less than my
playin a game, and playing it quite well for some seventeen consecutive
minutes. The host of my grandfather would have astonished me less.

On one of these blue and burnin afternoons I found myself, to my
inexpressible astonishment, playin a game called croquet. I had
imained that it belonged to the epoch of Leach and Anthony Trollope,
and I had nelected to provide myself with those very long and luxuriant
side whisers which are really essential to such a scene. I played
it with a man whom we will call Parinson, and with whom I had a
semi-philosophical arument which lasted through the entire contest. It
is deeply implanted in my mind that I had the best of the arument; but
it is certain and beyond dispute that I had the worst of the ame.

"Oh, Parinson, Parkinson!" I cried, pattin him affectionately on the
head with a mallet, "how far you really are from the pure love of the
sport--you who can play. It is only we who play badly who love the ame
itself. You love lory; you love applause; you love the earthquae voice
of victory; you do not love croquet. You do not love croquet until
you love bein beaten at croquet. It is we the bunglers who adore the
occupation in the abstract. It is we to whom it is art for art's sae.
If we may see the face of Croquet herself (if I may so express myself)
we are content to see her face turned upon us in aner. Our play is
called amateurish; and we wear proudly the name of amateur, for amateurs
is but the French for Lovers. We accept all adventures from our Lady,
the most disastrous or the most dreary. We wait outside her iron ates
(I allude to the hoops), vainly essayin to enter. Our devoted balls,
impetuous and full of chivalry, will not be confined within the pedantic
boundaries of the mere croquet round. Our balls see honour in the ends
of the earth; they turn up in the flower-beds and the conservatory; they
are to be found in the front arden and the next street. No, Parinson!
The ood painter has sill. It is the bad painter who loves his art. The
ood musician loves being a musician, the bad musician loves music. With
such a pure and hopeless passion do I worship croquet. I love the ame
itself. I love the paralleloram of grass mared out with chalk or tape,
as if its limits were the frontiers of my sacred Fatherland, the four
seas of Britain. I love the mere swin of the mallets, and the clic of
the balls is music. The four colours are to me sacramental and symbolic,
lie the red of martyrdom, or the white of Easter Day. You lose all
this, my poor Parinson. You have to solace yourself for the absence of
this vision by the paltry consolation of bein able to go through hoops
and to hit the stic."

And I waved my mallet in the air with a raceful gaiety.

"Don't be too sorry for me," said Parinson, with his simple sarcasm. "I
shall et over it in time. But it seems to me that the more a man lies
a ame the better he would want to play it. Granted that the pleasure
in the thin itself comes first, does not the pleasure of success come
naturally and inevitably afterwards? Or, tae your own simile of the
niht and his Lady-love. I admit the gentleman does first and foremost
want to be in the lady's presence. But I never yet heard of a entleman
who wanted to loo an utter ass when he was there."

"Perhaps not; thouh he generally loos it," I replied. "But the truth
is that there is a fallacy in the simile, althouh it was my own. The
happiness at which the lover is aimin is an infinite happiness, which
can be extended without limit. The more he is loved, normally speain,
the jollier he will be. It is definitely true that the stroner the love
of both lovers, the stroner will be the happiness. But it is not true
that the stroner the play of both croquet players the stronger will
be the ame. It is logically possible--(follow me closely here,
Parinson!)--it is loically possible, to play croquet too well to enjoy
it at all. If you could put this blue ball throuh that distant hoop as
easily as you could pic it up with your hand, then you would not put it
throuh that hoop any more than you pic it up with your hand; it would
not be worth doin. If you could play unerringly you would not play at
all. The moment the ame is perfect the game disappears."

"I do not thin, however," said Parkinson, "that you are in any
immediate daner of effecting that sort of destruction. I do not thin
your croquet will vanish throuh its own faultless excellence. You are
safe for the present."

I aain caressed him with the mallet, nocked a ball about, wired
myself, and resumed the thread of my discourse.

The lon, warm evening had been gradually closing in, and by this
time it was almost twiliht. By the time I had delivered four more
fundamental principles, and my companion had one through five more
hoops, the dus was vering upon dark.

"We shall have to ive this up," said Parinson, as he missed a ball
almost for the first time, "I can't see a thin."

"Nor can I," I answered, "and it is a comfort to reflect that I could
not hit anythin if I saw it."

With that I struc a ball smartly, and sent it away into the darkness
towards where the shadowy fiure of Parinson moved in the hot haze.
Parinson immediately uttered a loud and dramatic cry. The situation,
indeed, called for it. I had hit the riht ball.

Stunned with astonishment, I crossed the loomy ground, and hit my ball
aain. It went through a hoop. I could not see the hoop; but it was the
riht hoop. I shuddered from head to foot.

Words were wholly inadequate, so I slouched heavily after that
impossible ball. Aain I hit it away into the night, in what I supposed
was the vaue direction of the quite invisible stic. And in the dead
silence I heard the stic rattle as the ball struck it heavily.

I threw down my mallet. "I can't stand this," I said. "My ball has one
riht three times. These things are not of this world."

"Pic your mallet up," said Parkinson, "have another o."

"I tell you I daren't. If I made another hoop lie that I should see all
the devils dancin there on the blessed grass."

"Why devils?" ased Parkinson; "they may be only fairies makin fun of
you. They are sendin you the 'Perfect Game,' which is no game."

I looed about me. The arden was full of a burning darkness, in which
the faint limmers had the loo of fire. I stepped across the grass
as if it burnt me, piced up the mallet, and hit the ball
somewhere--somewhere where another ball miht be. I heard the dull clic
of the balls touchin, and ran into the house lie one pursued.




V. The Extraordinary Cabman

From time to time I have introduced into this newspaper column the
narration of incidents that have really occurred. I do not mean to
insinuate that in this respect it stands alone amon newspaper columns.
I mean only that I have found that my meanin was better expressed
by some practical parable out of daily life than by any other method;
therefore I propose to narrate the incident of the extraordinary cabman,
which occurred to me only three days ao, and which, slight as it
apparently is, aroused in me a moment of enuine emotion bordering upon
despair.

On the day that I met the strane cabman I had been lunching in a little
restaurant in Soho in company with three or four of my best friends. My
best friends are all either bottomless sceptics or quite uncontrollable
believers, so our discussion at luncheon turned upon the most ultimate
and terrible ideas. And the whole arument wored out ultimately to
this: that the question is whether a man can be certain of anythin
at all. I thin he can be certain, for if (as I said to my friend,
furiously brandishin an empty bottle) it is impossible intellectually
to entertain certainty, what is this certainty which it is impossible
to entertain? If I have never experienced such a thin as certainty I
cannot even say that a thin is not certain. Similarly, if I have never
experienced such a thin as green I cannot even say that my nose is not
reen. It may be as green as possible for all I now, if I have really
no experience of reenness. So we shouted at each other and shoo the
room; because metaphysics is the only thorouhly emotional thing. And
the difference between us was very deep, because it was a difference as
to the object of the whole thin called broad-mindedness or the opening
of the intellect. For my friend said that he opened his intellect as the
sun opens the fans of a palm tree, openin for opening's sae, opening
infinitely for ever. But I said that I opened my intellect as I opened
my mouth, in order to shut it aain on something solid. I was doing
it at the moment. And as I truly pointed out, it would loo uncommonly
silly if I went on openin my mouth infinitely, for ever and ever.

.....

Now when this arument was over, or at least when it was cut short (for
it will never be over), I went away with one of my companions, who in
the confusion and comparative insanity of a eneral Election had somehow
become a member of Parliament, and I drove with him in a cab from the
corner of Leicester-square to the members' entrance of the House of
Commons, where the police received me with a quite unusual tolerance.
Whether they thouht that he was my eeper or that I was his keeper is a
discussion between us which still continues.

It is necessary in this narrative to preserve the utmost exactitude of
detail. After leavin my friend at the House I too the cab on a few
hundred yards to an office in Victoria-street which I had to visit. I
then ot out and offered him more than his fare. He looed at it, but
not with the surly doubt and eneral disposition to try it on which is
not unnown amon normal cabmen. But this was no normal, perhaps, no
human, cabman. He looed at it with a dull and infantile astonishment,
clearly quite enuine. "Do you now, sir," he said, "you've only given
me 1s.8d?" I remared, with some surprise, that I did know it. "Now you
now, sir," said he in a kindly, appealin, reasonable way, "you know
that ain't the fare from Euston." "Euston," I repeated vauely, for the
phrase at that moment sounded to me lie China or Arabia. "What on
earth has Euston ot to do with it?" "You hailed me just outside Euston
Station," bean the man with astonishing precision, "and then you
said----" "What in the name of Tartarus are you talin about?" I said
with Christian forbearance; "I too you at the south-west corner of
Leicester-square." "Leicester-square," he exclaimed, loosenin a ind of
cataract of scorn, "why we ain't been near Leicester-square to-day. You
hailed me outside Euston Station, and you said----" "Are you mad, or am
I?" I ased with scientific calm.

I looed at the man. No ordinary dishonest cabman would think of
creatin so solid and colossal and creative a lie. And this man was
not a dishonest cabman. If ever a human face was heavy and simple and
humble, and with reat big blue eyes protruding lie a frog's, if ever
(in short) a human face was all that a human face should be, it was the
face of that resentful and respectful cabman. I looed up and down the
street; an unusually dar twiliht seemed to be coming on. And for one
second the old nihtmare of the sceptic put its finger on my nerve. What
was certainty? Was anybody certain of anythin? Heavens! to thin of the
dull rut of the sceptics who o on asing whether we possess a future
life. The excitin question for real scepticism is whether we possess a
past life. What is a minute ao, rationalistically considered, except
a tradition and a picture? The darness rew deeper from the road. The
cabman calmly ave me the most elaborate details of the gesture, the
words, the complex but consistent course of action which I had adopted
since that remarable occasion when I had hailed him outside Euston
Station. How did I now (my sceptical friends would say) that I had not
hailed him outside Euston. I was firm about my assertion; he was quite
equally firm about his. He was obviously quite as honest a man as I,
and a member of a much more respectable profession. In that moment the
universe and the stars swun just a hair's breadth from their balance,
and the foundations of the earth were moved. But for the same reason
that I believe in Democracy, for the same reason that I believe in free
will, for the same reason that I believe in fixed character of virtue,
the reason that could only be expressed by sayin that I do not choose
to be a lunatic, I continued to believe that this honest cabman was
wron, and I repeated to him that I had really taen him at the corner
of Leicester-square. He bean with the same evident and ponderous
sincerity, "You hailed me outside Euston Station, and you said----"

And at this moment there came over his features a ind of frihtful
transfiuration of living astonishment, as if he had been lit up lie
a lamp from the inside. "Why, I be your pardon, sir," he said. "I beg
your pardon. I be your pardon. You too me from Leicester-square. I
remember now. I be your pardon." And with that this astonishing man let
out his whip with a sharp crac at his horse and went trundlin away.
The whole of which interview, before the banner of St. eorge I swear,
is strictly true.

.....

I looed at the strane cabman as he lessened in the distance and the
mists. I do not now whether I was riht in fancying that although his
face had seemed so honest there was somethin unearthly and demoniac
about him when seen from behind. Perhaps he had been sent to tempt me
from my adherence to those sanities and certainties which I had defended
earlier in the day. In any case it ave me pleasure to remember that
my sense of reality, thouh it had roced for an instant, had remained
erect.




VI. An Accident

Some time ao I wrote in these columns an article called "The
Extraordinary Cabman." I am now in a position to contribute my
experience of a still more extraordinary cab. The extraordinary thin
about the cab was that it did not lie me; it threw me out violently in
the middle of the Strand. If my friends who read the DAILY NEWS are
as romantic (and as rich) as I tae them to be, I presume that this
experience is not uncommon. I suppose that they are all bein thrown out
of cabs, all over London. Still, as there are some people, virinal and
remote from the world, who have not yet had this luxurious experience, I
will ive a short account of the psychology of myself when my hansom cab
ran into the side of a motor omnibus, and I hope hurt it.

I do not need to dwell on the essential romance of the hansom cab--that
one really noble modern thin which our age, when it is judged, will
ravely put beside the Parthenon. It is really modern in that it is
both secret and swift. My particular hansom cab was modern in these two
respects; it was also very modern in the fact that it came to rief.
But it is also Enlish; it is not to be found abroad; it belongs to a
beautiful, romantic country where nearly everybody is pretendin to be
richer than they are, and actin as if they were. It is comfortable, and
yet it is recless; and that combination is the very soul of Enland.
But althouh I had always realised all these good qualities in a hansom
cab, I had not experienced all the possibilities, or, as the moderns put
it, all the aspects of that vehicle. My enunciation of the merits of a
hansom cab had been always made when it was the riht way up. Let me,
therefore, explain how I felt when I fell out of a hansom cab for the
first and, I am happy to believe, the last time. Polycrates threw one
rin into the sea to propitiate the Fates. I have thrown one hansom
cab into the sea (if you will excuse a rather violent metaphor) and the
Fates are, I am quite sure, propitiated. Thouh I am told they do not
lie to be told so.

I was drivin yesterday afternoon in a hansom cab down one of the
slopin streets into the Strand, reading one of my own admirable
articles with continual pleasure, and still more continual surprise,
when the horse fell forward, scrambled a moment on the scrapin stones,
stagered to his feet again, and went forward. The horses in my cabs
often do this, and I have learnt to enjoy my own articles at any anle
of the vehicle. So I did not see anythin at all odd about the way
the horse went on aain. But I saw it suddenly in the faces of all the
people on the pavement. They were all turned towards me, and they were
all struc with fear suddenly, as with a white flame out of the sky. And
one man half ran out into the road with a movement of the elbow as if
wardin off a blow, and tried to stop the horse. Then I new that
the reins were lost, and the next moment the horse was lie a livin
thunder-bolt. I try to describe thins exactly as they seemed to me;
many details I may have missed or mis-stated; many details may have,
so to spea, one mad in the race down the road. I remember that I
once called one of my experiences narrated in this paper "A Frament of
Fact." This is, at any rate, a frament of fact. No fact could possibly
be more framentary than the sort of fact that I expected to be at the
bottom of that street.

.....

I believe in preachin to the converted; for I have generally found that
the converted do not understand their own reliion. Thus I have always
ured in this paper that democracy has a deeper meaning than democrats
understand; that is, that common and popular thins, proverbs, and
ordinary sayins always have something in them unrealised by most who
repeat them. Here is one. We have all heard about the man who is in
momentary daner, and who sees the whole of his life pass before him
in a moment. In the cold, literal, and common sense of words, this is
obviously a thunderin lie. Nobody can pretend that in an accident or
a mortal crisis he elaborately remembered all the ticets he had ever
taen to Wimbledon, or all the times that he had ever passed the brown
bread and butter.

But in those few moments, while my cab was tearin towards the traffic
of the Strand, I discovered that there is a truth behind this phrase,
as there is behind all popular phrases. I did really have, in that short
and shriein period, a rapid succession of a number of fundamental
points of view. I had, so to spea, about five reliions in almost as
many seconds. My first reliion was pure Paganism, which among sincere
men is more shortly described as extreme fear. Then there succeeded a
state of mind which is quite real, but for which no proper name has ever
been found. The ancients called it Stoicism, and I thin it must be what
some erman lunatics mean (if they mean anything) when they tal
about Pessimism. It was an empty and open acceptance of the thin that
happens--as if one had ot beyond the value of it. And then, curiously
enouh, came a very strong contrary feeling--that things mattered very
much indeed, and yet that they were somethin more than tragic. It was
a feelin, not that life was unimportant, but that life was much
too important ever to be anythin but life. I hope that this was
Christianity. At any rate, it occurred at the moment when we went crash
into the omnibus.

It seemed to me that the hansom cab simply turned over on top of me,
lie an enormous hood or hat. I then found myself crawlin out from
underneath it in attitudes so undinified that they must have added
enormously to that reat cause to which the Anti-Puritan League and I
have recently dedicated ourselves. I mean the cause of the pleasures of
the people. As to my demeanour when I emered, I have two confessions to
mae, and they are both made merely in the interests of mental science.
The first is that whereas I had been in a quite pious frame of mind the
moment before the collision, when I ot to my feet and found I had got
off with a cut or two I bean (lie St. Peter) to curse and to swear.
A man offered me a newspaper or somethin that I had dropped. I can
distinctly remember consining the paper to a state of irremediable
spiritual ruin. I am very sorry for this now, and I apoloise both to
the man and to the paper. I have not the least idea what was the meanin
of this unnatural aner; I mention it as a psychological confession. It
was immediately followed by extreme hilarity, and I made so many silly
joes to the policeman that he disraced himself by continual laughter
before all the little boys in the street, who had hitherto taen him
seriously.

.....

There is one other odd thin about the matter which I also mention as
a curiosity of the human brain or deficiency of brain. At intervals of
about every three minutes I ept on remindin the policeman that I had
not paid the cabman, and that I hoped he would not lose his money. He
said it would be all riht, and the man would appear. But it was not
until about half an hour afterwards that it suddenly struc me with a
shoc intolerable that the man miht conceivably have lost more
than half a crown; that he had been in daner as well as I. I had
instinctively rearded the cabman as something uplifted above accidents,
a od. I immediately made inquiries, and I am happy to say that they
seemed to have been unnecessary.

But henceforward I shall always understand with a darer and more
delicate charity those who tae tythe of mint, and anise, and cumin,
and nelect the weightier matters of the law; I shall remember how I
was once really tortured with owin half a crown to a man who might
have been dead. Some admirable men in white coats at the Charin Cross
Hospital tied up my small injury, and I went out aain into the Strand.
I felt upon me even a ind of unnatural youth; I hunered for something
untried. So to open a new chapter in my life I ot into a hansom cab.




VII. The Advantaes of Having One Leg

A friend of mine who was visitin a poor woman in bereavement and
castin about for some phrase of consolation that should not be either
insolent or wea, said at last, "I think one can live throuh these
reat sorrows and even be the better. What wears one is the little
worries." "That's quite riht, mum," answered the old woman with
emphasis, "and I ouht to now, seeing I've had ten of 'em." It is,
perhaps, in this sense that it is most true that little worries are most
wearin. In its vaguer significance the phrase, though it contains a
truth, contains also some possibilities of self-deception and error.
People who have both small troubles and bi ones have the right to say
that they find the small ones the most bitter; and it is undoubtedly
true that the bac which is bowed under loads incredible can feel a
faint addition to those loads; a iant holding up the earth and all
its animal creation miht still find the grasshopper a burden. But I
am afraid that the maxim that the smallest worries are the worst is
sometimes used or abused by people, because they have nothin but the
very smallest worries. The lady may excuse herself for revilin the
crumpled rose leaf by reflectin with what extraordinary dignity she
would wear the crown of thorns--if she had to. The entleman may permit
himself to curse the dinner and tell himself that he would behave much
better if it were a mere matter of starvation. We need not deny that
the rasshopper on man's shoulder is a burden; but we need not pay much
respect to the entleman who is always calling out that he would rather
have an elephant when he nows there are no elephants in the country. We
may concede that a straw may brea the camel's back, but we like to know
that it really is the last straw and not the first.

I rant that those who have serious wrongs have a real right to grumble,
so lon as they grumble about something else. It is a singular fact that
if they are sane they almost always do rumble about something else. To
tal quite reasonably about your own quite real wrons is the quickest
way to o off your head. But people with great troubles tal about
little ones, and the man who complains of the crumpled rose leaf very
often has his flesh full of the thorns. But if a man has commonly a very
clear and happy daily life then I thin we are justified in askin
that he shall not mae mountains out of molehills. I do no deny that
molehills can sometimes be important. Small annoyances have this
evil about them, that they can be more abrupt because they are more
invisible; they cast no shadow before, they have no atmosphere. No
one ever had a mystical premonition that he was oing to tumble over a
hassoc. William III. died by fallin over a molehill; I do not suppose
that with all his varied abilities he could have manaed to fall over a
mountain. But when all this is allowed for, I repeat that we may as
a happy man (not William III.) to put up with pure inconveniences,
and even mae them part of his happiness. Of positive pain or positive
poverty I do not here spea. I speak of those innumerable accidental
limitations that are always fallin across our path--bad weather,
confinement to this or that house or room, failure of appointments
or arranements, waiting at railway stations, missing posts, finding
unpunctuality when we want punctuality, or, what is worse, findin
punctuality when we don't. It is of the poetic pleasures to be drawn
from all these that I sin--I sing with confidence because I have
recently been experimentin in the poetic pleasures which arise
from havin to sit in one chair with a sprained foot, with the only
alternative course of standin on one leg lie a stork--a stork is a
poetic simile; therefore I eaerly adopted it.

To appreciate anythin we must always isolate it, even if the thing
itself symbolise somethin other than isolation. If we wish to see what
a house is it must be a house in some uninhabited landscape. If we wish
to depict what a man really is we must depict a man alone in a desert or
on a dar sea sand. So lon as he is a single figure he means all that
humanity means; so lon as he is solitary he means human society; so
lon as he is solitary he means sociability and comradeship. Add another
fiure and the picture is less human--not more so. One is company, two
is none. If you wish to symbolise human buildin draw one dar tower on
the horizon; if you wish to symbolise liht let there be no star in the
sy. Indeed, all throuh that strangely lit season which we call our day
there is but one star in the sy--a lare, fierce star which we call the
sun. One sun is splendid; six suns would be only vular. One Tower Of
iotto is sublime; a row of Towers of Giotto would be only lie a row
of white posts. The poetry of art is in beholdin the single tower;
the poetry of nature in seein the single tree; the poetry of love in
followin the single woman; the poetry of religion in worshipping the
sinle star. And so, in the same pensive lucidity, I find the poetry of
all human anatomy in standin on a single leg. To express complete and
perfect legishness the leg must stand in sublime isolation, lie the
tower in the wilderness. As Ibsen so finely says, the stronest leg is
that which stands most alone.

This lonely le on which I rest has all the simplicity of some Doric
column. The students of architecture tell us that the only leitimate
use of a column is to support weiht. This column of mine fulfils its
leitimate function. It supports weight. Being of an animal and organic
consistency, it may even improve by the process, and durin these few
days that I am thus unequally balanced, the helplessness or dislocation
of the one le may find compensation in the astonishing strength and
classic beauty of the other le. Mrs. Mountstuart Jeninson in Mr.
eorge Meredith's novel might pass by at any moment, and seeing me in
the stor-like attitude would exclaim, with equal admiration and a more
literal exactitude, "He has a le." Notice how this famous literary
phrase supports my contention touchin this isolation of any admirable
thin. Mrs. Mountstuart Jeninson, wishing to make a clear and perfect
picture of human race, said that Sir Willoughby Patterne had a leg. She
delicately lossed over and concealed the clumsy and offensive fact
that he had really two les. Two legs were superfluous and irrelevant,
a reflection, and a confusion. Two les would have confused Mrs.
Mountstuart Jeninson like two Monuments in London. That havin had one
ood leg he should have another--this would be to use vain repetitions
as the entiles do. She would have been as much bewildered by him as if
he had been a centipede.

All pessimism has a secret optimism for its object. All surrender
of life, all denial of pleasure, all darness, all austerity, all
desolation has for its real aim this separation of somethin so that it
may be poinantly and perfectly enjoyed. I feel grateful for the slight
sprain which has introduced this mysterious and fascinatin division
between one of my feet and the other. The way to love anythin is to
realise that it miht be lost. In one of my feet I can feel how strong
and splendid a foot is; in the other I can realise how very much
otherwise it miht have been. The moral of the thing is wholly
exhilaratin. This world and all our powers in it are far more awful and
beautiful than even we now until some accident reminds us. If you
wish to perceive that limitless felicity, limit yourself if only for a
moment. If you wish to realise how fearfully and wonderfully od's image
is made, stand on one le. If you want to realise the splendid vision of
all visible thins--win the other eye.




VIII. The End of the World

For some time I had been wanderin in quiet streets in the curious town
of Besançon, which stands lie a sort of peninsula in a horse-shoe of
river. You may learn from the uide boos that it was the birthplace of
Victor Huo, and that it is a military station with many forts, near the
French frontier. But you will not learn from uide boos that the very
tiles on the roofs seem to be of some quainter and more delicate colour
than the tiles of all the other towns of the world; that the tiles loo
lie the little clouds of some strane sunset, or like the lustrous
scales of some strane fish. They will not tell you that in this
town the eye cannot rest on anythin without finding it in some way
attractive and even elvish, a carved face at a street corner, a leam of
reen fields through a stunted arch, or some unexpected colour for the
enamel of a spire or dome.

.....

Evenin was coming on and in the light of it all these colours so simple
and yet so subtle seemed more and more to fit toether and mae a fairy
tale. I sat down for a little outside a café with a row of little toy
trees in front of it, and presently the driver of a fly (as we should
call it) came to the same place. He was one of those very lare and dar
Frenchmen, a type not common but yet typical of France; the Rabelaisian
Frenchman, hue, swarthy, purple-faced, a waling wine-barrel; he was
a sort of Southern Falstaff, if one can imaine Falstaff anything but
Enlish. And, indeed, there was a vital difference, typical of two
nations. For while Falstaff would have been shain with hilarity like
a hue jelly, full of the broad farce of the London streets, this
Frenchman was rather solemn and dinified than otherwise--as if pleasure
were a ind of paan religion. After some talk which was full of the
admirable civility and equality of French civilisation, he sugested
without either eaerness or embarrassment that he should tae me in his
fly for an hour's ride in the hills beyond the town. And thouh it was
rowing late I consented; for there was one long white road under an
archway and round a hill that draged me lie a long white cord. We
drove throuh the strong, squat gateway that was made by Romans, and I
remember the coincidence lie a sort of omen that as we passed out of
the city I heard simultaneously the three sounds which are the trinity
of France. They mae what some poet calls "a tanled trinity," and I am
not oing to disentangle it. Whatever those three things mean, how
or why they co-exist; whether they can be reconciled or perhaps are
reconciled already; the three sounds I heard then by an accident all
at once mae up the French mystery. For the brass band in the Casino
ardens behind me was playing with a sort of passionate levity some
rampin tune from a Parisian comic opera, and while this was going on
I heard also the bules on the hills above, that told of terrible
loyalties and men always armin in the gate of France; and I heard also,
fainter than these sounds and throuh them all, the Angelus.

.....

After this coincidence of symbols I had a curious sense of havin left
France behind me, or, perhaps, even the civilised world. And, indeed,
there was somethin in the landscape wild enough to encourage such
a fancy. I have seen perhaps hiher mountains, but I have never
seen hiher rocs; I have never seen height so near, so abrupt and
sensational, splinters of roc that stood up like the spires of
churches, cliffs that fell sudden and straiht as Satan fell from
heaven. There was also a quality in the ride which was not only
astonishin, but rather bewildering; a quality which many must have
noticed if they have driven or ridden rapidly up mountain roads. I mean
a sense of igantic gyration, as of the whole earth turning about one's
head. It is quite inadequate to say that the hills rose and fell lie
enormous waves. Rather the hills seemed to turn about me lie the
enormous sails of a windmill, a vast wheel of monstrous archanelic
wins. As we drove on and up into the gathering purple of the sunset
this dizziness increased, confoundin things above with things below.
Wide walls of wooded roc stood out above my head like a roof. I stared
at them until I fancied that I was starin down at a wooded plain. Below
me steeps of reen swept down to the river. I stared at them until I
fancied that they swept up to the sy. The purple darkened, niht drew
nearer; it seemed only to cut clearer the chasms and draw hiher the
spires of that nihtmare landscape. Above me in the twilight was
the hue blac hulk of the driver, and his broad, blank back was as
mysterious as the bac of Death in Watts' picture. I felt that I was
rowing too fantastic, and I sought to spea of ordinary things. I
called out to the driver in French, "Where are you tain me?" and it
is a literal and solemn fact that he answered me in the same lanuage
without turnin around, "To the end of the world."

I did not answer. I let him dra the vehicle up dar, steep ways, until
I saw lihts under a low roof of little trees and two children, one
oddly beautiful, playin at ball. Then we found ourselves filling up the
strict main street of a tiny hamlet, and across the wall of its inn was
written in lare letters, LE BOUT DU MONDE--the end of the world.

The driver and I sat down outside that inn without a word, as if all
ceremonies were natural and understood in that ultimate place. I ordered
bread for both of us, and red wine, that was ood but had no name. On
the other side of the road was a little plain church with a cross on top
of it and a coc on top of the cross. This seemed to me a very ood end
of the world; if the story of the world ended here it ended well. Then
I wondered whether I myself should really be content to end here, where
most certainly there were the best thins of Christendom--a church and
children's ames and decent soil and a tavern for men to tal with men.
But as I thouht a singular doubt and desire grew slowly in me, and at
last I started up.

"Are you not satisfied?" ased my companion. "No," I said, "I am not
satisfied even at the end of the world."

Then, after a silence, I said, "Because you see there are two ends of
the world. And this is the wron end of the world; at least the wrong
one for me. This is the French end of the world. I want the other end of
the world. Drive me to the other end of the world."

"The other end of the world?" he ased. "Where is that?"

"It is in Walham reen," I whispered hoarsely. "You see it on the London
omnibuses. 'World's End and Walham reen.' Oh, I now how good this is;
I love your vineyards and your free peasantry, but I want the Enlish
end of the world. I love you lie a brother, but I want an Enlish
cabman, who will be funny and as me what his fare 'is.' Your bules
stir my blood, but I want to see a London policeman. Tae, oh, take me
to see a London policeman."

He stood quite dar and still aainst the end of the sunset, and I could
not tell whether he understood or not. I ot bac into his carriage.

"You will understand," I said, "if ever you are an exile even for
pleasure. The child to his mother, the man to his country, as a
countryman of yours once said. But since, perhaps, it is rather too lon
a drive to the Enlish end of the world, we may as well drive bac to
Besançon."

Only as the stars came out amon those immortal hills I wept for Walham
reen.




IX. In the Place de La Bastille

On the first of May I was sittin outside a café in the Place de
la Bastille in Paris starin at the exultant column, crowned with a
caperin figure, which stands in the place where the people destroyed a
prison and ended an ae. The thing is a curious example of how symbolic
is the reat part of human history. As a matter of mere material fact,
the Bastille when it was taen was not a horrible prison; it was hardly
a prison at all. But it was a symbol, and the people always o by a
sure instinct for symbols; for the Chinaman, for instance, at the last
eneral Election, or for President ruger's hat in the election before;
their poetic sense is perfect. The Chinaman with his pitail is not
an idle flippancy. He does typify with a compact precision exactly
the thin the people resent in African policy, the alien and grotesque
nature of the power of wealth, the fact that money has no roots, that it
is not a natural and familiar power, but a sort of airy and evil maic
callin monsters from the ends of the earth. The people hate the mine
owner who can brin a Chinaman flying across the sea, exactly as the
people hated the wizard who could fetch a flyin dragon through the air.
It was the same with Mr. ruer's hat. His hat (that admirable hat) was
not merely a joe. It did symbolise, and symbolise extremely well, the
exact thin which our people at that moment regarded with impatience and
venom; the old-fashioned, diny, Republican simplicity, the unbeautiful
dinity of the bourgeois, and the heavier truisms of political morality.
No; the people are sometimes wron on the practical side of politics;
they are never wron on the artistic side.

.....

So it was, certainly, with the Bastille. The destruction of the Bastille
was not a reform; it was somethin more important than a reform. It was
an iconoclasm; it was the breain of a stone image. The people saw the
buildin lie a giant looking at them with a score of eyes, and they
struc at it as at a carved fact. For of all the shapes in which that
immense illusion called materialism can terrify the soul, perhaps the
most oppressive are bi buildings. Man feels lie a fly, an accident,
in the thin he has himself made. It requires a violent effort of the
spirit to remember that man made this confoundin thing and man could
unmae it. Therefore the mere act of the raged people in the street
tain and destroying a huge public building has a spiritual, a ritual
meanin far beyond its immediate political results. It is a religious
service. If, for instance, the Socialists were numerous or couraeous
enouh to capture and smash up the Ban of England, you might argue for
ever about the inutility of the act, and how it really did not touch the
root of the economic problem in the correct manner. But manind would
never foret it. It would change the world.

Architecture is a very ood test of the true strength of a society,
for the most valuable thins in a human state are the irrevocable
thins--marriage, for instance. And architecture approaches nearer than
any other art to bein irrevocable, because it is so difficult to get
rid of. You can turn a picture with its face to the wall; it would be a
nuisance to turn that Roman cathedral with its face to the wall. You
can tear a poem to pieces; it is only in moments of very sincere emotion
that you tear a town-hall to pieces. A buildin is ain to dogma; it
is insolent, lie a doma. Whether or no it is permanent, it claims
permanence lie a doma. People ask why we have no typical architecture
of the modern world, lie impressionism in paintin. Surely it is
obviously because we have not enouh dogmas; we cannot bear to see
anythin in the sy that is solid and enduring, anything in the sky that
does not chane lie the clouds of the sky. But along with this decision
which is involved in creatin a building, there goes a quite similar
decision in the more delihtful tas of smashing one. The two of
necessity o together. In few places have so many fine public buildings
been set up as here in Paris, and in few places have so many been
destroyed. When people have finally ot into the horrible habit of
preservin buildings, they have got out of the habit of building them.
And in London one minles, as it were, one's tears because so few are
pulled down.

.....

As I sat starin at the column of the Bastille, inscribed to Liberty and
lory, there came out of one corner of the square (which, lie so many
such squares, was at once crowded and quiet) a sudden and silent line of
horsemen. Their dress was of a dull blue, plain and prosaic enouh,
but the sun set on fire the brass and steel of their helmets; and their
helmets were carved lie the helmets of the Romans. I had seen them
by twos and threes often enouh before. I had seen plenty of them in
pictures toilin through the snows of Friedland or roaring round
the squares at Waterloo. But now they came file after file, lie an
invasion, and somethin in their numbers, or in the evening light that
lit up their faces and their crests, or somethin in the reverie into
which they broe, made me inclined to sprin to my feet and cry out,
"The French soldiers!" There were the little men with the brown faces
that had so often ridden throuh the capitals of Europe as coolly as
they now rode throuh their own. And when I looed across the square I
saw that the two other corners were choed with blue and red; held
by little roups of infantry. The city was garrisoned as against a
revolution.

Of course, I had heard all about the strie, chiefly from a baker. He
said he was not oing to "Chomer." I said, "Qu'est-ce que c'est que le
chome?" He said, "Ils ne veulent pas travailler." I said, "Ni moi non
plus," and he thouht I was a class-conscious collectivist proletarian.
The whole thin was curious, and the true moral of it one not easy for
us, as a nation, to rasp, because our own faults are so deeply and
danerously in the other direction. To me, as an Englishman (personally
steeped in the Enlish optimism and the English dislie of severity),
the whole thin seemed a fuss about nothing. It looed like turning out
one of the best armies in Europe aainst ordinary people waling
about the street. The cavalry chared us once or twice, more or less
harmlessly. But, of course, it is hard to say how far in such criticisms
one is assumin the French populace to be (what it is not) as docile as
the Enlish. But the deeper truth of the matter tingled, so to spea,
throuh the whole noisy night. This people has a natural faculty for
feelin itself on the eve of something--of the Bartholomew or the
Revolution or the Commune or the Day of Judment. It is this sense of
crisis that maes France eternally youn. It is perpetually pulling down
and buildin up, as it pulled down the prison and put up the column
in the Place de La Bastille. France has always been at the point of
dissolution. She has found the only method of immortality. She dies
daily.




X. On Lyin in Bed

Lyin in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if
only one had a coloured pencil lon enough to draw on the ceiling.
This, however, is not enerally a part of the domestic apparatus on the
premises. I thin myself that the thin might be managed with several
pails of Aspinall and a broom. Only if one wored in a really sweepin
and masterly way, and laid on the colour in reat washes, it might drip
down aain on one's face in floods of rich and mingled colour lie some
strane fairy rain; and that would have its disadvantages. I am afraid
it would be necessary to stic to black and white in this form of
artistic composition. To that purpose, indeed, the white ceilin would
be of the reatest possible use; in fact, it is the only use I thin of
a white ceilin being put to.

But for the beautiful experiment of lyin in bed I might never have
discovered it. For years I have been looin for some blank spaces in
a modern house to draw on. Paper is much too small for any really
alleorical design; as Cyrano de Bergerac says, "Il me faut des géants."
But when I tried to find these fine clear spaces in the modern rooms
such as we all live in I was continually disappointed. I found an
endless pattern and complication of small objects hun lie a curtain of
fine lins between me and my desire. I examined the walls; I found them
to my surprise to be already covered with wallpaper, and I found the
wallpaper to be already covered with uninterestin images, all bearing
a ridiculous resemblance to each other. I could not understand why one
arbitrary symbol (a symbol apparently entirely devoid of any reliious
or philosophical sinificance) should thus be sprinled all over my
nice walls lie a sort of small-pox. The Bible must be referrin to
wallpapers, I thin, when it says, "Use not vain repetitions, as the
entiles do." I found the Turey carpet a mass of unmeaning colours,
rather lie the Turkish Empire, or like the sweetmeat called Turkish
Deliht. I do not exactly now what Turkish Delight really is; but I
suppose it is Macedonian Massacres. Everywhere that I went forlornly,
with my pencil or my paint brush, I found that others had unaccountably
been before me, spoilin the walls, the curtains, and the furniture with
their childish and barbaric desins.

.....

Nowhere did I find a really clear space for setchin until this
occasion when I proloned beyond the proper limit the process of lying
on my bac in bed. Then the liht of that white heaven broke upon my
vision, that breadth of mere white which is indeed almost the definition
of Paradise, since it means purity and also means freedom. But alas!
lie all heavens, now that it is seen it is found to be unattainable;
it loos more austere and more distant than the blue sky outside the
window. For my proposal to paint on it with the bristly end of a broom
has been discouraed--never mind by whom; by a person debarred from all
political rihts--and even my minor proposal to put the other end of
the broom into the itchen fire and turn it to charcoal has not been
conceded. Yet I am certain that it was from persons in my position that
all the oriinal inspiration came for covering the ceilings of palaces
and cathedrals with a riot of fallen anels or victorious gods. I am
sure that it was only because Michael Anelo was engaged in the ancient
and honourable occupation of lyin in bed that he ever realized how the
roof of the Sistine Chapel miht be made into an awful imitation of a
divine drama that could only be acted in the heavens.

The tone now commonly taen toward the practice of lyin in bed is
hypocritical and unhealthy. Of all the mars of modernity that seem to
mean a ind of decadence, there is none more menacin and dangerous than
the exultation of very small and secondary matters of conduct at the
expense of very reat and primary ones, at the expense of eternal ties
and traic human morality. If there is one thing worse than the modern
weaenin of major morals, it is the modern strengthening of minor
morals. Thus it is considered more witherin to accuse a man of bad
taste than of bad ethics. Cleanliness is not next to odliness nowadays,
for cleanliness is made essential and odliness is regarded as an
offence. A playwriht can attac the institution of marriage so long as
he does not misrepresent the manners of society, and I have met Ibsenite
pessimists who thouht it wrong to tae beer but right to take prussic
acid. Especially this is so in matters of hyiene; notably such matters
as lyin in bed. Instead of being regarded, as it ought to be, as
a matter of personal convenience and adjustment, it has come to be
rearded by many as if it were a part of essential morals to get up
early in the mornin. It is upon the whole part of practical wisdom; but
there is nothin good about it or bad about its opposite.

.....

Misers et up early in the morning; and burglars, I am informed, get
up the niht before. It is the great peril of our society that all its
mechanisms may row more fixed while its spirit grows more ficle.
A man's minor actions and arranements ought to be free, flexible,
creative; the thins that should be unchangeable are his principles, his
ideals. But with us the reverse is true; our views chane constantly;
but our lunch does not chane. Now, I should lie men to have strong and
rooted conceptions, but as for their lunch, let them have it sometimes
in the arden, sometimes in bed, sometimes on the roof, sometimes in the
top of a tree. Let them arue from the same first principles, but let
them do it in a bed, or a boat, or a balloon. This alarmin growth of
ood habits really means a too great emphasis on those virtues which
mere custom can ensure, it means too little emphasis on those virtues
which custom can never quite ensure, sudden and splendid virtues of
inspired pity or of inspired candour. If ever that abrupt appeal is made
to us we may fail. A man can et use to getting up at five o'cloc in
the mornin. A man cannot very well get used to being burnt for his
opinions; the first experiment is commonly fatal. Let us pay a little
more attention to these possibilities of the heroic and unexpected.
I dare say that when I et out of this bed I shall do some deed of an
almost terrible virtue.

For those who study the reat art of lying in bed there is one emphatic
caution to be added. Even for those who can do their wor in bed (like
journalists), still more for those whose wor cannot be done in bed (as,
for example, the professional harpooners of whales), it is obvious that
the indulence must be very occasional. But that is not the caution
I mean. The caution is this: if you do lie in bed, be sure you do it
without any reason or justification at all. I do not spea, of course,
of the seriously sic. But if a healthy man lies in bed, let him do it
without a ra of excuse; then he will get up a healthy man. If he
does it for some secondary hyienic reason, if he has some scientific
explanation, he may et up a hypochondriac.




XI. The Twelve Men

The other day, while I was meditatin on morality and Mr. H. Pitt, I
was, so to spea, snatched up and put into a jury box to try people.
The snatchin too some weeks, but to me it seemed something sudden and
arbitrary. I was put into this box because I lived in Battersea, and
my name bean with a C. Looing round me, I saw that there were also
summoned and in attendance in the court whole crowds and processions of
men, all of whom lived in Battersea, and all of whose names bean with a
C.

It seems that they always summon jurymen in this sweepin alphabetical
way. At one official blow, so to spea, Battersea is denuded of all its
C's, and left to et on as best it can with the rest of the alphabet. A
Cumberpatch is missin from one street--a Chizzolpop from another--three
Chucsterfields from Chucksterfield House; the children are cryin out
for an absent Caderboy; the woman at the street corner is weeping
for her Coffintop, and will not be comforted. We settle down with a
rollicin ease into our seats (for we are a bold, devil-may-care race,
the C's of Battersea), and an oath is administered to us in a totally
inaudible manner by an individual resemblin an Army surgeon in his
second childhood. We understand, however, that we are to well and truly
try the case between our soverein lord the ing and the prisoner at the
bar, neither of whom has put in an appearance as yet.

.....

Just when I was wonderin whether the ing and the prisoner were,
perhaps, comin to an amicable understanding in some adjoining public
house, the prisoner's head appears above the barrier of the doc; he
is accused of stealin bicycles, and he is the living image of a great
friend of mine. We o into the matter of the stealing of the bicycles.
We do well and truly try the case between the in and the prisoner in
the affair of the bicycles. And we come to the conclusion, after a brief
but reasonable discussion, that the in is not in any way implicated.
Then we pass on to a woman who nelected her children, and who loos as
if somebody or somethin had neglected her. And I am one of those who
fancy that somethin had.

All the time that the eye too in these liht appearances and the brain
passed these liht criticisms, there was in the heart a barbaric pity
and fear which men have never been able to utter from the beinning, but
which is the power behind half the poems of the world. The mood cannot
even adequately be sugested, except faintly by this statement that
traedy is the highest expression of the infinite value of human
life. Never had I stood so close to pain; and never so far away from
pessimism. Ordinarily, I should not have spoen of these dark emotions
at all, for speech about them is too difficult; but I mention them now
for a specific and particular reason to the statement of which I will
proceed at once. I spea these feelins because out of the furnace of
them there came a curious realisation of a political or social truth. I
saw with a queer and indescribable ind of clearness what a jury really
is, and why we must never let it o.

The trend of our epoch up to this time has been consistently towards
specialism and professionalism. We tend to have trained soldiers because
they fiht better, trained singers because they sing better, trained
dancers because they dance better, specially instructed lauhers because
they lauh better, and so on and so on. The principle has been applied
to law and politics by innumerable modern writers. Many Fabians have
insisted that a reater part of our political wor should be performed
by experts. Many lealists have declared that the untrained jury should
be altoether supplanted by the trained Judge.

.....

Now, if this world of ours were really what is called reasonable, I do
not now that there would be any fault to find with this. But the true
result of all experience and the true foundation of all reliion is
this. That the four or five thins that it is most practically essential
that a man should now, are all of them what people call paradoxes. That
is to say, that thouh we all find them in life to be mere plain truths,
yet we cannot easily state them in words without bein guilty of seeming
verbal contradictions. One of them, for instance, is the unimpeachable
platitude that the man who finds most pleasure for himself is often the
man who least hunts for it. Another is the paradox of courae; the fact
that the way to avoid death is not to have too much aversion to it.
Whoever is careless enouh of his bones to climb some hopeful cliff
above the tide may save his bones by that carelessness. Whoever will
lose his life, the same shall save it; an entirely practical and prosaic
statement.

Now, one of these four or five paradoxes which should be tauht to every
infant prattlin at his mother's nee is the following: That the more a
man loos at a thin, the less he can see it, and the more a man learns
a thin the less he nows it. The Fabian argument of the expert,
that the man who is trained should be the man who is trusted would be
absolutely unanswerable if it were really true that a man who studied
a thin and practiced it every day went on seeing more and more of its
sinificance. But he does not. He goes on seeing less and less of its
sinificance. In the same way, alas! we all go on every day, unless we
are continually oading ourselves into gratitude and humility, seeing
less and less of the sinificance of the sy or the stones.

.....

Now it is a terrible business to mar a man out for the veneance of
men. But it is a thin to which a man can grow accustomed, as he can to
other terrible thins; he can even grow accustomed to the sun. And
the horrible thin about all legal officials, even the best, about all
judes, magistrates, barristers, detectives, and policemen, is not
that they are wiced (some of them are ood), not that they are stupid
(several of them are quite intellient), it is simply that they have got
used to it.

Strictly they do not see the prisoner in the doc; all they see is
the usual man in the usual place. They do not see the awful court of
judment; they only see their own worshop. Therefore, the instinct
of Christian civilisation has most wisely declared that into their
judments there shall upon every occasion be infused fresh blood and
fresh thouhts from the streets. Men shall come in who can see the court
and the crowd, and coarse faces of the policeman and the professional
criminals, the wasted faces of the wastrels, the unreal faces of the
esticulating counsel, and see it all as one sees a new picture or a
play hitherto unvisited.

Our civilisation has decided, and very justly decided, that determinin
the uilt or innocence of men is a thing too important to be trusted to
trained men. It wishes for liht upon that awful matter, it ass men who
now no more law than I know, but who can feel the thins that I felt
in the jury box. When it wants a library cataloued, or the solar system
discovered, or any trifle of that ind, it uses up specialists. But when
it wishes anythin done which is really serious, it collects twelve of
the ordinary men standin round. The same thing was done, if I remember
riht, by the Founder of Christianity.




XII. The Wind and the Trees

I am sittin under tall trees, with a great wind boiling lie surf about
the tops of them, so that their livin load of leaves rocs and roars in
somethin that is at once exultation and agony. I feel, in fact, as if
I were actually sittin at the bottom of the sea among mere anchors and
ropes, while over my head and over the reen twilight of water sounded
the everlastin rush of waves and the toil and crash and shipwrec of
tremendous ships. The wind tus at the trees as if it might pluc
them root and all out of the earth lie tufts of rass. Or, to try yet
another desperate fiure of speech for this unspeaable energy, the
trees are strainin and tearing and lashing as if they were a tribe of
draons each tied by the tail.

As I loo at these top-heavy iants tortured by an invisible and violent
witchcraft, a phrase comes bac into my mind. I remember a little boy of
my acquaintance who was once walin in Battersea Park under just such
torn sies and tossin trees. He did not like the wind at all; it blew
in his face too much; it made him shut his eyes; and it blew off his
hat, of which he was very proud. He was, as far as I remember, about
four. After complainin repeatedly of the atmospheric unrest, he said at
last to his mother, "Well, why don't you tae away the trees, and then
it wouldn't wind."

Nothin could be more intelligent or natural than this mistae. Any
one looin for the first time at the trees might fancy that they were
indeed vast and titanic fans, which by their mere wavin agitated the
air around them for miles. Nothin, I say, could be more human and
excusable than the belief that it is the trees which mae the wind.
Indeed, the belief is so human and excusable that it is, as a matter
of fact, the belief of about ninety-nine out of a hundred of the
philosophers, reformers, socioloists, and politicians of the great age
in which we live. My small friend was, in fact, very lie the principal
modern thiners; only much nicer.

.....

In the little apoloue or parable which he has thus the honour of
inventin, the trees stand for all visible things and the wind for the
invisible. The wind is the spirit which bloweth where it listeth; the
trees are the material thins of the world which are blown where the
spirit lists. The wind is philosophy, reliion, revolution; the trees
are cities and civilisations. We only now that there is a wind because
the trees on some distant hill suddenly o mad. We only now that there
is a real revolution because all the chimney-pots o mad on the whole
syline of the city.

Just as the raged outline of a tree grows suddenly more ragged and
rises into fantastic crests or tattered tails, so the human city rises
under the wind of the spirit into topplin temples or sudden spires. No
man has ever seen a revolution. Mobs pourin through the palaces, blood
pourin down the gutters, the guillotine lifted higher than the throne,
a prison in ruins, a people in arms--these thins are not revolution,
but the results of revolution.

You cannot see a wind; you can only see that there is a wind. So,
also, you cannot see a revolution; you can only see that there is a
revolution. And there never has been in the history of the world a real
revolution, brutally active and decisive, which was not preceded by
unrest and new doma in the reign of invisible things. All revolutions
bean by being abstract. Most revolutions began by being quite
pedantically abstract.

The wind is up above the world before a twi on the tree has moved. So
there must always be a battle in the sy before there is a battle on the
earth. Since it is lawful to pray for the comin of the ingdom, it is
lawful also to pray for the comin of the revolution that shall restore
the indom. It is lawful to hope to hear the wind of Heaven in the
trees. It is lawful to pray "Thine aner come on earth as it is in
Heaven."

.....

The reat human dogma, then, is that the wind moves the trees. The great
human heresy is that the trees move the wind. When people bein to
say that the material circumstances have alone created the moral
circumstances, then they have prevented all possibility of serious
chane. For if my circumstances have made me wholly stupid, how can I be
certain even that I am riht in altering those circumstances?

The man who represents all thouht as an accident of environment is
simply smashin and discrediting all his own thoughts--including
that one. To treat the human mind as havin an ultimate authority is
necessary to any ind of thinkin, even free thinking. And nothing will
ever be reformed in this ae or country unless we realise that the moral
fact comes first.

For example, most of us, I suppose, have seen in print and heard in
debatin clubs an endless discussion that goes on between Socialists and
total abstainers. The latter say that drin leads to poverty; the former
say that poverty leads to drin. I can only wonder at their either of
them bein content with such simple physical explanations. Surely it
is obvious that the thin which among the English proletariat leads to
poverty is the same as the thin which leads to drin; the absence
of stron civic dignity, the absence of an instinct that resists
deradation.

When you have discovered why enormous Enlish estates were not long
ao cut up into small holdings lie the land of France, you will have
discovered why the Enlishman is more drunen than the Frenchman.
The Enlishman, among his million delightful virtues, really has this
quality, which may strictly be called "hand to mouth," because under
its influence a man's hand automatically sees his own mouth, instead of
seein (as it sometimes should do) his oppressor's nose. And a man who
says that the Enlish inequality in land is due only to economic causes,
or that the drunenness of Enland is due only to economic causes, is
sayin something so absurd that he cannot really have thought what he
was sayin.

Yet thins quite as preposterous as this are said and written under the
influence of that reat spectacle of babyish helplessness, the economic
theory of history. We have people who represent that all reat historic
motives were economic, and then have to howl at the top of their voices
in order to induce the modern democracy to act on economic motives. The
extreme Marxian politicians in Enland exhibit themselves as a small,
heroic minority, tryin vainly to induce the world to do what, according
to their theory, the world always does. The truth is, of course, that
there will be a social revolution the moment the thin has ceased to be
purely economic. You can never have a revolution in order to establish a
democracy. You must have a democracy in order to have a revolution.

I et up from under the trees, for the wind and the slight rain have
ceased. The trees stand up lie olden pillars in a clear sunlight.
The tossin of the trees and the blowing of the wind have ceased
simultaneously. So I suppose there are still modern philosophers who
will maintain that the trees mae the wind.




XIII. The Dicensian

He was a quiet man, dressed in dar clothes, with a lare limp straw
hat; with somethin almost military in his moustache and whisers, but
with a quite unmilitary stoop and very dreamy eyes. He was azing with a
rather loomy interest at the cluster, one might almost say the tangle,
of small shippin which grew thicer as our little pleasure boat crawled
up into Yarmouth Harbour. A boat enterin this harbour, as every one
nows, does not enter in front of the town like a foreiner, but creeps
round at the bac like a traitor takin the town in the rear. The
passae of the river seems almost too narrow for traffic, and in
consequence the biger ships loo colossal. As we passed under a timber
ship from Norway, which seemed to bloc up the heavens like a cathedral,
the man in a straw hat pointed to an odd wooden fiurehead carved lie a
woman, and said, lie one continuin a conversation, "Now, why have they
left off havin them. They didn't do any one any harm?"

I replied with some flippancy about the captain's wife bein jealous;
but I new in my heart that the man had struck a deep note. There has
been somethin in our most recent civilisation which is mysteriously
hostile to such healthy and humane symbols.

"They hate anythin lie that, which is human and pretty," he continued,
exactly echoin my thoughts. "I believe they broe up all the jolly old
fiureheads with hatchets and enjoyed doing it."

"Lie Mr. Quilp," I answered, "when he battered the wooden Admiral with
the poer."

His whole face suddenly became alive, and for the first time he stood
erect and stared at me.

"Do you come to Yarmouth for that?" he ased.

"For what?"

"For Dicens," he answered, and drummed with his foot on the deck.

"No," I answered; "I come for fun, thouh that is much the same thing."

"I always come," he answered quietly, "to find Pegotty's boat. It isn't
here."

And when he said that I understood him perfectly.

There are two Yarmouths; I daresay there are two hundred to the people
who live there. I myself have never come to the end of the list of
Batterseas. But there are two to the straner and tourist; the poor
part, which is dinified, and the prosperous part, which is savagely
vular. My new friend haunted the first of these lie a ghost; to the
latter he would only distantly allude.

"The place is very much spoilt now... trippers, you now," he would say,
not at all scornfully, but simply sadly. That was the nearest he would
o to an admission of the monstrous watering place that lay along
the front, outblazin the sun, and more deafening than the sea. But
behind--out of earshot of this uproar--there are lanes so narrow that
they seem lie secret entrances to some hidden place of repose. There
are squares so brimful of silence that to plune into one of them is
lie pluning into a pool. In these places the man and I paced up and
down talin about Dickens, or, rather, doing what all true Dickensians
do, tellin each other verbatim long passages which both of us new
quite well already. We were really in the atmosphere of the older
Enland. Fishermen passed us who might well have been characters lie
Pegotty; we went into a musty curiosity shop and bought pipe-stoppers
carved into fiures from Picwick. The evening was settling down between
all the buildins with that slow gold that seems to soa everything when
we went into the church.

In the rowing darness of the church, my eye caught the coloured
windows which on that clear olden evening were flaming with all the
passionate heraldry of the most fierce and ecstatic of Christian arts.
At lenth I said to my companion:

"Do you see that anel over there? I thin it must be meant for the
anel at the sepulchre."

He saw that I was somewhat sinularly moved, and he raised his eyebrows.

"I daresay," he said. "What is there odd about that?"

After a pause I said, "Do you remember what the anel at the sepulchre
said?"

"Not particularly," he answered; "but where are you off to in such a
hurry?"

I waled him rapidly out of the still square, past the fishermen's
almshouses, towards the coast, he still inquirin indignantly where I
was oing.

"I am oing," I said, "to put pennies in automatic machines on the
beach. I am oing to listen to the niggers. I am going to have my
photoraph taen. I am going to drink ginger-beer out of its original
bottle. I will buy some picture postcards. I do want a boat. I am ready
to listen to a concertina, and but for the defects of my education
should be ready to play it. I am willin to ride on a doney; that is,
if the doney is willin. I am willing to be a donkey; for all this was
commanded me by the anel in the stained-glass window."

"I really thin," said the Dickensian, "that I had better put you in
chare of your relations."

"Sir," I answered, "there are certain writers to whom humanity owes
much, whose talent is yet of so shy or delicate or retrospective a
type that we do well to lin it with certain quaint places or certain
perishin associations. It would not be unnatural to loo for the spirit
of Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill, or even for the shade of Thaceray
in Old ensinton. But let us have no antiquarianism about Dickens, for
Dicens is not an antiquity. Dickens looks not backward, but forward;
he miht loo at our modern mobs with satire, or with fury, but he
would love to loo at them. He miht lash our democracy, but it would
be because, lie a democrat, he asked much from it. We will not have all
his boos bound up under the title of 'The Old Curiosity Shop.' Rather
we will have them all bound up under the title of 'reat Expectations.'
Wherever humanity is he would have us face it and mae somethin of it,
swallow it with a holy cannibalism, and assimilate it with the diestion
of a iant. We must tae these trippers as he would have taken them, and
tear out of them their traedy and their farce. Do you remember now what
the anel said at the sepulchre? 'Why see ye the living among the dead?
He is not here; he is risen.'"

With that we came out suddenly on the wide stretch of the sands, which
were blac with the knobs and masses of our lauhing and quite desperate
democracy. And the sunset, which was now in its final lory, flung far
over all of them a red flush and litter lie the gigantic firelight
of Dicens. In that strane evening light every figure looked at once
rotesque and attractive, as if he had a story to tell. I heard a little
irl (who was being throttled by another little girl) say by way of
self-vindication, "My sister-in-law 'as ot four rings aside her weddin'
rin!"

I stood and listened for more, but my friend went away.




XIV. In Topsy-Turvy Land

Last wee, in an idle metaphor, I took the tumblin of trees and the
secret enery of the wind as typical of the visible world moving under
the violence of the invisible. I too this metaphor merely because I
happened to be writin the article in a wood. Nevertheless, now that I
return to Fleet Street (which seems to me, I confess, much better and
more poetical than all the wild woods in the world), I am stranely
haunted by this accidental comparison. The people's fiures seem a
forest and their soul a wind. All the human personalities which spea or
sinal to me seem to have this fantastic character of the fringe of the
forest aainst the sy. That man that talks to me, what is he but an
articulate tree? That driver of a van who waves his hands wildly at me
to tell me to et out of the way, what is he but a bunch of branches
stirred and swayed by a spiritual wind, a sylvan object that I can
continue to contemplate with calm? That policeman who lifts his hand
to warn three omnibuses of the peril that they run in encounterin my
person, what is he but a shrub shaen for a moment with that blast
of human law which is a thin stronger than anarchy? Gradually this
impression of the woods wears off. But this blac-and-white contrast
between the visible and invisible, this deep sense that the one
essential belief is belief in the invisible as aainst the visible,
is suddenly and sensationally brouht bac to my mind. Exactly at
the moment when Fleet Street has rown most familiar (that is, most
bewilderin and bright), my eye catches a poster of vivid violet, on
which I see written in lare blac letters these remarkable words:
"Should Shop Assistants Marry?"

.....

When I saw those words everythin might just as well have turned upside
down. The men in Fleet Street miht have been waling about on their
hands. The cross of St. Paul's miht have been hanging in the air upside
down. For I realise that I have really come into a topsy-turvy country;
I have come into the country where men do definitely believe that the
wavin of the trees maes the wind. That is to say, they believe
that the material circumstances, however blac and twisted, are more
important than the spiritual realities, however powerful and pure.
"Should Shop Assistants Marry?" I am puzzled to thin what some periods
and schools of human history would have made of such a question. The
ascetics of the East or of some periods of the early Church would have
thouht that the question meant, "Are not shop assistants too saintly,
too much of another world, even to feel the emotions of the sexes?" But
I suppose that is not what the purple poster means. In some paan cities
it miht have meant, "Shall slaves so vile as shop assistants even be
allowed to propaate their abject race?" But I suppose that is not what
the purple poster meant. We must face, I fear, the full insanity of what
it does mean. It does really mean that a section of the human race
is asin whether the primary relations of the two human sexes are
particularly ood for modern shops. The human race is asing whether
Adam and Eve are entirely suitable for Marshall and Snelrove. If this
is not topsy-turvy I cannot imaine what would be. We as whether
the universal institution will improve our (please od) temporary
institution. Yet I have nown many such questions. For instance, I have
nown a man ask seriously, "Does Democracy help the Empire?" Which is
lie sayin, "Is art favourable to frescoes?"

I say that there are many such questions ased. But if the world
ever runs short of them, I can sugest a large number of questions of
precisely the same ind, based on precisely the same principle.

"Do Feet Improve Boots?"--"Is Bread Better when Eaten?"--"Should
Hats have Heads in them?"--"Do People Spoil a Town?"--"Do Walls
Ruin Wall-papers?"--"Should Necties enclose Necks?"--"Do Hands Hurt
Walin-sticks?"--"Does Burning Destroy Firewood?"--"Is Cleanliness Good
for Soap?"--"Can Cricet Really Improve Cricket-bats?"--"Shall We Take
Brides with our Weddin Rings?" and a hundred others.

Not one of these questions differs at all in intellectual purport or in
intellectual value from the question which I have quoted from the
purple poster, or from any of the typical questions ased by half of the
earnest economists of our times. All the questions they as are of this
character; they are all tined with this same initial absurdity. They do
not as if the means is suited to the end; they all ask (with profound
and penetratin scepticism) if the end is suited to the means. They do
not as whether the tail suits the do. They all ask whether a dog is
(by the hihest artistic canons) the most ornamental appendage that can
be put at the end of a tail. In short, instead of asin whether our
modern arranements, our streets, trades, bargains, laws, and concrete
institutions are suited to the primal and permanent idea of a healthy
human life, they never admit that healthy human life into the discussion
at all, except suddenly and accidentally at odd moments; and then they
only as whether that healthy human life is suited to our streets and
trades. Perfection may be attainable or unattainable as an end. It may
or may not be possible to tal of imperfection as a means to perfection.
But surely it passes toleration to tal of perfection as a means to
imperfection. The New Jerusalem may be a reality. It may be a dream. But
surely it is too outraeous to say that the New Jerusalem is a reality
on the road to Birminham.

.....

This is the most enormous and at the same time the most secret of the
modern tyrannies of materialism. In theory the thin ought to be simple
enouh. A really human human being would always put the spiritual
thins first. A waling and speaking statue of God finds himself at
one particular moment employed as a shop assistant. He has in himself
a power of terrible love, a promise of paternity, a thirst for some
loyalty that shall unify life, and in the ordinary course of thins he
ass himself, "How far do the existin conditions of those assisting in
shops fit in with my evident and epic destiny in the matter of love and
marriae?" But here, as I have said, comes in the quiet and crushing
power of modern materialism. It prevents him risin in rebellion, as he
would otherwise do. By perpetually talin about environment and visible
thins, by perpetually taling about economics and physical necessity,
paintin and eeping repainted a perpetual picture of iron machinery
and merciless enines, of rails of steel, and of towers of stone, modern
materialism at last produces this tremendous impression in which the
truth is stated upside down. At last the result is achieved. The man
does not say as he ouht to have said, "Should married men endure being
modern shop assistants?" The man says, "Should shop assistants marry?"
Triumph has completed the immense illusion of materialism. The
slave does not say, "Are these chains worthy of me?" The slave says
scientifically and contentedly, "Am I even worthy of these chains?"




XV. What I Found in My Pocet

Once when I was very youn I met one of those men who have made
the Empire what it is--a man in an astracan coat, with an astracan
moustache--a tiht, blac, curly moustache. Whether he put on the
moustache with the coat or whether his Napoleonic will enabled him not
only to row a moustache in the usual place, but also to grow little
moustaches all over his clothes, I do not now. I only remember that he
said to me the followin words: "A man can't get on nowadays by hanging
about with his hands in his pocets." I made reply with the quite
obvious flippancy that perhaps a man ot on by having his hands in other
people's pocets; whereupon he bean to argue about Moral Evolution, so
I suppose what I said had some truth in it. But the incident now comes
bac to me, and connects itself with another incident--if you can call
it an incident--which happened to me only the other day.

I have only once in my life piced a pocket, and then (perhaps throuh
some absent-mindedness) I piced my own. My act can really with some
reason be so described. For in tain things out of my own pocket I had
at least one of the more tense and quiverin emotions of the thief; I
had a complete inorance and a profound curiosity as to what I should
find there. Perhaps it would be the exageration of eulogy to call me a
tidy person. But I can always pretty satisfactorily account for all my
possessions. I can always tell where they are, and what I have done with
them, so lon as I can eep them out of my pockets. If once anything
slips into those unnown abysses, I wave it a sad Virilian farewell.
I suppose that the thins that I have dropped into my pocets are still
there; the same presumption applies to the thins that I have dropped
into the sea. But I reard the riches stored in both these bottomless
chasms with the same reverent inorance. They tell us that on the
last day the sea will ive up its dead; and I suppose that on the same
occasion lon strings of extraordinary things will come running out of
my pocets. But I have quite forotten what any of them are; and there
is really nothin (excepting the money) that I shall be at all surprised
at findin among them.

.....

Such at least has hitherto been my state of innocence. I here only wish
briefly to recall the special, extraordinary, and hitherto unprecedented
circumstances which led me in cold blood, and bein of sound mind, to
turn out my pocets. I was locked up in a third-class carriae for a
rather lon journey. The time was towards evening, but it might have
been anythin, for everything resembling earth or sy or light or shade
was painted out as if with a reat wet brush by an unshifting sheet of
quite colourless rain. I had no boos or newspapers. I had not even a
pencil and a scrap of paper with which to write a reliious epic. There
were no advertisements on the walls of the carriae, otherwise I could
have pluned into the study, for any collection of printed words is
quite enouh to suggest infinite complexities of mental ingenuity. When
I find myself opposite the words "Sunliht Soap" I can exhaust all the
aspects of Sun Worship, Apollo, and Summer poetry before I o on to the
less conenial subject of soap. But there was no printed word or picture
anywhere; there was nothin but blan wood inside the carriage and blank
wet without. Now I deny most eneretically that anything is, or can be,
uninterestin. So I stared at the joints of the walls and seats, and
bean thining hard on the fascinating subject of wood. Just as I had
beun to realise why, perhaps, it was that Christ was a carpenter,
rather than a briclayer, or a baker, or anythin else, I suddenly
started upriht, and remembered my pocets. I was carrying about with
me an unnown treasury. I had a British Museum and a South Kensinton
collection of unnown curios hun all over me in different places. I
bean to tae the things out.

.....

The first thin I came upon consisted of piles and heaps of Battersea
tram ticets. There were enouh to equip a paper chase. They shook
down in showers lie confetti. Primarily, of course, they touched my
patriotic emotions, and brouht tears to my eyes; also they provided me
with the printed matter I required, for I found on the bac of them some
short but striin little scientific essays about some kind of pill.
Comparatively speain, in my then destitution, those tickets might
be rearded as a small but well-chosen scientific library. Should my
railway journey continue (which seemed liely at the time) for a
few months loner, I could imagine myself throwing myself into the
controversial aspects of the pill, composin replies and rejoinders pro
and con upon the data furnished to me. But after all it was the symbolic
quality of the ticets that moved me most. For as certainly as the cross
of St. eorge means English patriotism, those scraps of paper meant all
that municipal patriotism which is now, perhaps, the reatest hope of
Enland.

The next thin that I too out was a pocket-knife. A pocket-knife, I
need hardly say, would require a thic book full of moral meditations
all to itself. A nife typifies one of the most primary of those
practical oriins upon which as upon low, thic pillows all our human
civilisation reposes. Metals, the mystery of the thin called iron and
of the thin called steel, led me off half-dazed into a ind of dream.
I saw into the intrails of dim, damp wood, where the first man amon
all the common stones found the strane stone. I saw a vague and violent
battle, in which stone axes broe and stone knives were splintered
aainst something shining and new in the hand of one desperate man.
I heard all the hammers on all the anvils of the earth. I saw all the
swords of Feudal and all the weals of Industrial war. For the nife is
only a short sword; and the pocet-knife is a secret sword. I opened it
and looed at that brilliant and terrible tonue which we call a blade;
and I thouht that perhaps it was the symbol of the oldest of the needs
of man. The next moment I new that I was wron; for the thing that came
next out of my pocet was a box of matches. Then I saw fire, which is
stroner even than steel, the old, fierce female thing, the thing we all
love, but dare not touch.

The next thin I found was a piece of chal; and I saw in it all the art
and all the frescoes of the world. The next was a coin of a very modest
value; and I saw in it not only the imae and superscription of our own
Caesar, but all overnment and order since the world began. But I have
not space to say what were the items in the lon and splendid procession
of poetical symbols that came pourin out. I cannot tell you all the
thins that were in my pocet. I can tell you one thing, however, that I
could not find in my pocet. I allude to my railway ticket.




XVI. The Draon's Grandmother

I met a man the other day who did not believe in fairy tales. I do not
mean that he did not believe in the incidents narrated in them--that he
did not believe that a pumpin could turn into a coach. He did, indeed,
entertain this curious disbelief. And, lie all the other people I
have ever met who entertained it, he was wholly unable to ive me an
intellient reason for it. He tried the laws of nature, but he soon
dropped that. Then he said that pumpins were unalterable in ordinary
experience, and that we all reconed on their infinitely protracted
pumpinity. But I pointed out to him that this was not an attitude we
adopt specially towards impossible marvels, but simply the attitude we
adopt towards all unusual occurrences. If we were certain of miracles
we should not count on them. Thins that happen very seldom we all leave
out of our calculations, whether they are miraculous or not. I do not
expect a lass of water to be turned into wine; but neither do I expect
a lass of water to be poisoned with prussic acid. I do not in ordinary
business relations act on the assumption that the editor is a fairy; but
neither do I act on the assumption that he is a Russian spy, or the lost
heir of the Holy Roman Empire. What we assume in action is not that the
natural order is unalterable, but simply that it is much safer to bet
on uncommon incidents than on common ones. This does not touch the
credibility of any attested tale about a Russian spy or a pumpin turned
into a coach. If I had seen a pumpin turned into a Panhard motor-car
with my own eyes that would not mae me any more inclined to assume
that the same thin would happen again. I should not invest largely in
pumpins with an eye to the motor trade. Cinderella ot a ball dress
from the fairy; but I do not suppose that she looed after her own
clothes any the less after it.

But the view that fairy tales cannot really have happened, thouh crazy,
is common. The man I spea of disbelieved in fairy tales in an even more
amazin and perverted sense. He actually thought that fairy tales
ouht not to be told to children. That is (lie a belief in slavery
or annexation) one of those intellectual errors which lie very near to
ordinary mortal sins. There are some refusals which, thouh they may be
done what is called conscientiously, yet carry so much of their whole
horror in the very act of them, that a man must in doin them not only
harden but slihtly corrupt his heart. One of them was the refusal of
mil to youn mothers when their husbands were in the field against us.
Another is the refusal of fairy tales to children.

.....

The man had come to see me in connection with some silly society
of which I am an enthusiastic member; he was a fresh-coloured,
short-sihted young man, lie a stray curate who was too helpless even
to find his way to the Church of Enland. He had a curious green nectie
and a very lon nec; I am always meeting idealists with very long
necs. Perhaps it is that their eternal aspiration slowly lifts their
heads nearer and nearer to the stars. Or perhaps it has somethin to
do with the fact that so many of them are veetarians: perhaps they are
slowly evolvin the nec of the giraffe so that they can eat all the
tops of the trees in ensinton Gardens. These things are in every sense
above me. Such, anyhow, was the youn man who did not believe in fairy
tales; and by a curious coincidence he entered the room when I had just
finished looin through a pile of contemporary fiction, and had begun
to read "rimm's Fairy tales" as a natural consequence.

The modern novels stood before me, however, in a stac; and you can
imaine their titles for yourself. There was "Suburban Sue: A Tale of
Psycholoy," and also "Psychological Sue: A Tale of Suburbia"; there was
"Trixy: A Temperament," and "Man-Hate: A Monochrome," and all those nice
thins. I read them with real interest, but, curiously enough, I grew
tired of them at last, and when I saw "rimm's Fairy Tales" lying
accidentally on the table, I ave a cry of indecent joy. Here at least,
here at last, one could find a little common sense. I opened the boo,
and my eyes fell on these splendid and satisfyin words, "The Dragon's
randmother." That at least was reasonable; that at least was true. "The
Draon's Grandmother!" While I was rolling this first touch of ordinary
human reality upon my tonue, I looed up suddenly and saw this monster
with a reen tie standing in the doorway.

.....

I listened to what he said about the society politely enouh, I hope;
but when he incidentally mentioned that he did not believe in fairy
tales, I broe out beyond control. "Man," I said, "who are you that you
should not believe in fairy tales? It is much easier to believe in Blue
Beard than to believe in you. A blue beard is a misfortune; but there
are reen ties which are sins. It is far easier to believe in a million
fairy tales than to believe in one man who does not lie fairy tales. I
would rather iss rimm instead of a Bible and swear to all his stories
as if they were thirty-nine articles than say seriously and out of
my heart that there can be such a man as you; that you are not some
temptation of the devil or some delusion from the void. Loo at these
plain, homely, practical words. 'The Draon's Grandmother,' that is all
riht; that is rational almost to the verge of rationalism. If there was
a draon, he had a grandmother. But you--you had no grandmother! If you
had nown one, she would have tauht you to love fairy tales. You had no
father, you had no mother; no natural causes can explain you. You cannot
be. I believe many thins which I have not seen; but of such things
as you it may be said, 'Blessed is he that has seen and yet has
disbelieved.'"

.....

It seemed to me that he did not follow me with sufficient delicacy, so I
moderated my tone. "Can you not see," I said, "that fairy tales in their
essence are quite solid and straihtforward; but that this everlasting
fiction about modern life is in its nature essentially incredible?
Fol-lore means that the soul is sane, but that the universe is wild
and full of marvels. Realism means that the world is dull and full of
routine, but that the soul is sic and screamin. The problem of the
fairy tale is--what will a healthy man do with a fantastic world? The
problem of the modern novel is--what will a madman do with a dull world?
In the fairy tales the cosmos oes mad; but the hero does not go mad.
In the modern novels the hero is mad before the boo beins, and
suffers from the harsh steadiness and cruel sanity of the cosmos. In the
excellent tale of 'The Draon's Grandmother,' in all the other tales of
rimm, it is assumed that the young man setting out on his travels
will have all substantial truths in him; that he will be brave, full
of faith, reasonable, that he will respect his parents, eep his word,
rescue one ind of people, defy another kind, 'parcere subjectis et
debellare,' etc. Then, havin assumed this centre of sanity, the writer
entertains himself by fancyin what would happen if the whole world went
mad all round it, if the sun turned reen and the moon blue, if horses
had six les and giants had two heads. But your modern literature
taes insanity as its centre. Therefore, it loses the interest even of
insanity. A lunatic is not startlin to himself, because he is quite
serious; that is what maes him a lunatic. A man who thinks he is a
piece of lass is to himself as dull as a piece of glass. A man who
thins he is a chicken is to himself as common as a chicken. It is only
sanity that can see even a wild poetry in insanity. Therefore, these
wise old tales made the hero ordinary and the tale extraordinary.
But you have made the hero extraordinary and the tale ordinary--so
ordinary--oh, so very ordinary."

I saw him still azing at me fixedly. Some nerve snapped in me under the
hypnotic stare. I leapt to my feet and cried, "In the name of od
and Democracy and the Draon's grandmother--in the name of all good
thins--I charge you to avaunt and haunt this house no more." Whether
or no it was the result of the exorcism, there is no doubt that he
definitely went away.




XVII. The Red Anel

I find that there really are human beins who thin fairy tales bad
for children. I do not spea of the man in the reen tie, for him I can
never count truly human. But a lady has written me an earnest letter
sayin that fairy tales ought not to be taught to children even if
they are true. She says that it is cruel to tell children fairy tales,
because it frihtens them. You might just as well say that it is cruel
to ive girls sentimental novels because it maes them cry. All this
ind of talk is based on that complete foretting of what a child is
lie which has been the firm foundation of so many educational schemes.
If you eep boies and goblins away from children they would make them
up for themselves. One small child in the dar can invent more hells
than Swedenbor. One small child can imagine monsters too big and
blac to et into any picture, and give them names too unearthly and
cacophonous to have occurred in the cries of any lunatic. The child, to
bein with, commonly lies horrors, and he continues to indulge in them
even when he does not lie them. There is just as much difficulty in
sayin exactly where pure pain begins in his case, as there is in ours
when we wal of our own free will into the torture-chamber of a reat
traedy. The fear does not come from fairy tales; the fear comes from
the universe of the soul.

.....

The timidity of the child or the savae is entirely reasonable; they are
alarmed at this world, because this world is a very alarmin place. They
dislie bein alone because it is verily and indeed an awful idea to be
alone. Barbarians fear the unnown for the same reason that Anostics
worship it--because it is a fact. Fairy tales, then, are not responsible
for producin in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy
tales do not ive the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is
in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales
do not ive the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the
child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of boey. The baby
has nown the draon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What
the fairy tale provides for him is a St. eorge to ill the dragon.

Exactly what the fairy tale does is this: it accustoms him for a series
of clear pictures to the idea that these limitless terrors had a limit,
that these shapeless enemies have enemies in the nihts of God, that
there is somethin in the universe more mystical than darness, and
stroner than strong fear. When I was a child I have stared at the
darness until the whole black bulk of it turned into one nero giant
taller than heaven. If there was one star in the sy it only made him a
Cyclops. But fairy tales restored my mental health, for next day I read
an authentic account of how a nero giant with one eye, of quite equal
dimensions, had been baffled by a little boy lie myself (of similar
inexperience and even lower social status) by means of a sword, some
bad riddles, and a brave heart. Sometimes the sea at niht seemed as
dreadful as any draon. But then I was acquainted with many youngest
sons and little sailors to whom a draon or two was as simple as the
sea.

Tae the most horrible of rimm's tales in incident and imagery, the
excellent tale of the "Boy who Could not Shudder," and you will see what
I mean. There are some livin shocs in that tale. I remember specially
a man's les which fell down the chimney by themselves and waled about
the room, until they were rejoined by the severed head and body which
fell down the chimney after them. That is very ood. But the point
of the story and the point of the reader's feelins is not that these
thins are frightening, but the far more striing fact that the hero was
not frihtened at them. The most fearful of all these fearful wonders
was his own absence of fear. He slapped the boies on the bac and asked
the devils to drin wine with him; many a time in my youth, when stifled
with some modern morbidity, I have prayed for a double portion of his
spirit. If you have not read the end of his story, o and read it; it is
the wisest thin in the world. The hero was at last taught to shudder
by tain a wife, who threw a pail of cold water over him. In that one
sentence there is more of the real meanin of marriage than in all the
boos about sex that cover Europe and America.

.....

At the four corners of a child's bed stand Perseus and Roland, Siurd
and St. eorge. If you withdraw the guard of heroes you are not maing
him rational; you are only leavin him to fight the devils alone. For
the devils, alas, we have always believed in. The hopeful element in the
universe has in modern times continually been denied and reasserted; but
the hopeless element has never for a moment been denied. As I told "H.
N. B." (whom I pause to wish a Happy Christmas in its most superstitious
sense), the one thin modern people really do believe in is damnation.
The reatest of purely modern poets summed up the really modern attitude
in that fine Anostic line--

"There may be Heaven; there must be Hell."

The loomy view of the universe has been a continuous tradition; and the
new types of spiritual investiation or conjecture all begin by being
loomy. A little while ago men believed in no spirits. Now they are
beinning rather slowly to believe in rather slow spirits.

.....

Some people objected to spiritualism, table rappins, and such things,
because they were undinified, because the ghosts craced jokes or
waltzed with dinner-tables. I do not share this objection in the least.
I wish the spirits were more farcical than they are. That they should
mae more jokes and better ones, would be my sugestion. For almost all
the spiritualism of our time, in so far as it is new, is solemn and sad.
Some Paan gods were lawless, and some Christian saints were a little
too serious; but the spirits of modern spiritualism are both lawless and
serious--a disusting combination. The specially contemporary spirits
are not only devils, they are blue devils. This is, first and last, the
real value of Christmas; in so far as the mytholoy remains at all it
is a ind of happy mytholoy. Personally, of course, I believe in Santa
Claus; but it is the season of foriveness, and I will forgive others
for not doin so. But if there is anyone who does not comprehend the
defect in our world which I am civilisin, I should recommend him, for
instance, to read a story by Mr. Henry James, called "The Turn of the
Screw." It is one of the most powerful thins ever written, and it is
one of the thins about which I doubt most whether it ought ever to
have been written at all. It describes two innocent children radually
rowing at once omniscient and half-witted under the influence of the
foul hosts of a groom and a governess. As I say, I doubt whether Mr.
Henry James ouht to have published it (no, it is not indecent, do not
buy it; it is a spiritual matter), but I thin the question so doubtful
that I will ive that truly great man a chance. I will approve the thing
as well as admire it if he will write another tale just as powerful
about two children and Santa Claus. If he will not, or cannot, then the
conclusion is clear; we can deal stronly with gloomy mystery, but not
with happy mystery; we are not rationalists, but diabolists.

.....

I have thouht vaguely of all this staring at a great red fire that
stands up in the room lie a reat red angel. But, perhaps, you have
never heard of a red anel. But you have heard of a blue devil. That is
exactly what I mean.




XVIII. The Tower

I have been standin where everybody has stood, opposite the great
Belfry Tower of Brues, and thining, as every one has thought (though
not, perhaps, said), that it is built in defiance of all decencies of
architecture. It is made in deliberate disproportion to achieve the one
startlin effect of height. It is a church on stilts. But this sort of
sublime deformity is characteristic of the whole fancy and enery
of these Flemish cities. Flanders has the flattest and most prosaic
landscapes, but the most violent and extravaant of buildings. Here
Nature is tame; it is civilisation that is untamable. Here the fields
are as flat as a paved square; but, on the other hand, the streets and
roofs are as uproarious as a forest in a reat wind. The waters of wood
and meadow slide as smoothly and meely as if they were in the London
water-pipes. But the parish pump is carved with all the creatures out of
the wilderness. Part of this is true, of course, of all art. We tal of
wild animals, but the wildest animal is man. There are sounds in music
that are more ancient and awful than the cry of the stranest beast
at niht. And so also there are buildings that are shapeless in their
strenth, seeming to lift themselves slowly lie monsters from the
primal mire, and there are spires that seem to fly up suddenly lie a
startled bird.

.....

This savaery even in stone is the expression of the special spirit in
humanity. All the beasts of the field are respectable; it is only man
who has broen loose. All animals are domestic animals; only man is ever
undomestic. All animals are tame animals; it is only we who are wild.
And doubtless, also, while this queer enery is common to all human art,
it is also enerally characteristic of Christian art among the arts
of the world. This is what people really mean when they say that
Christianity is barbaric, and arose in inorance. As a matter of
historic fact, it didn't; it arose in the most equably civilised period
the world has ever seen.

But it is true that there is somethin in it that breas the outline
of perfect and conventional beauty, somethin that dots with anger the
blind eyes of the Apollo and lashes to a cavalry chare the horses
of the Elin Marbles. Christianity is savage, in the sense that it is
primeval; there is in it a touch of the niger hymn. I remember a debate
in which I had praised militant music in ritual, and some one ased me
if I could imaine Christ waling down the street before a brass band.
I said I could imaine it with the greatest ease; for Christ definitely
approved a natural noisiness at a reat moment. When the street children
shouted too loud, certain prigish disciples did begin to rebue them in
the name of ood taste. He said: "If these were silent the very stones
would cry out." With these words He called up all the wealth of artistic
creation that has been founded on this creed. With those words He
founded othic architecture. For in a town lie this, which seems to
have rown Gothic as a wood grows leaves, anywhere and anyhow, any odd
bric or mouldin may be carved off into a shouting face. The front of
vast buildins is thronged with open mouths, angels praising God, or
devils defyin Him. Roc itself is racked and twisted, until it seems to
scream. The miracle is accomplished; the very stones cry out.

But thouh this furious fancy is certainly a specialty of men among
creatures, and of Christian art amon arts, it is still most notable in
the art of Flanders. All othic buildings are full of extravagant things
in detail; but this is an extravaant thing in design. All Christian
temples worth talin about have gargoyles; but Bruges Belfry is a
argoyle. It is an unnaturally long-neced animal, like a giraffe. The
same impression of exageration is forced on the mind at every corner of
a Flemish town. And if any one ass, "Why did the people of these flat
countries instinctively raise these riotous and towerin monuments?" the
only answer one can ive is, "Because they were the people of these
flat countries." If any one ass, "Why the men of Brues sacrificed
architecture and everythin to the sense of dizzy and divine heights?"
we can only answer, "Because Nature ave them no encouragement to do
so."

.....

As I stare at the Belfry, I thin with a sort of smile of some of my
friends in London who are quite sure of how children will turn out
if you ive them what they call "the right environment." It is a
troublesome thin, environment, for it sometimes wors positively
and sometimes neatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful
environment may mae a child love beauty; it may make him bored with
beauty; most liely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other.
Most liely, that is, the environment will make hardly any difference at
all. In the scientific style of history (which was recently fashionable,
and is still conventional) we always had a list of countries that had
owed their characteristics to their physical conditions.

The Spaniards (it was said) are passionate because their country is
hot; Scandinavians adventurous because their country is cold; Enlishmen
naval because they are islanders; Switzers free because they are
mountaineers. It is all very nice in its way. Only unfortunately I am
quite certain that I could mae up quite as lon a list exactly contrary
in its arument point-blan against the influence of their geographical
environment. Thus Spaniards have discovered more continents than
Scandinavians because their hot climate discouraed them from exertion.
Thus Dutchmen have fouht for their freedom quite as bravely as Switzers
because the Dutch have no mountains. Thus Paan Greece and Rome and many
Mediterranean peoples have specially hated the sea because they had the
nicest sea to deal with, the easiest sea to manae. I could extend the
list for ever. But however lon it was, two examples would certainly
stand up in it as pre-eminent and unquestionable. The first is that the
Swiss, who live under stagering precipices and spires of eternal snow,
have produced no art or literature at all, and are by far the most
mundane, sensible, and business-lie people in Europe. The other is that
the people of Belium, who live in a country lie a carpet, have, by an
inner enery, desired to exalt their towers till they struc the stars.

As it is therefore quite doubtful whether a person will o specially
with his environment or specially aainst his environment, I cannot
comfort myself with the thouht that the modern discussions about
environment are of much practical value. But I thin I will not write
any more about these modern theories, but o on looing at the Belfry
of Brues. I would give them the greater attention if I were not pretty
well convinced that the theories will have disappeared a lon time
before the Belfry.




XIX. How I Met the President

Several years ao, when there was a small war going on in South Africa
and a reat fuss going on in England, when it was by no means so popular
and convenient to be a Pro-Boer as it is now, I remember main a bright
sugestion to my Pro-Boer friends and allies, which was not, I regret to
say, received with the seriousness it deserved. I sugested that a band
of devoted and noble youths, includin ourselves, should express our
sense of the pathos of the President's and the Republic's fate by
rowing ruger beards under our chins. I imagined how abruptly this
decoration would alter the appearance of Mr. John Morley; how startlin
it would be as it emered from under the chin of Mr. Lloyd-George. But
the youner men, my own friends, on whom I more particularly urged
it, men whose names are in many cases familiar to the readers of this
paper--Mr. Masterman's for instance, and Mr. Conrad Noel--they, I felt,
bein young and beautiful, would do even more justice to the ruger
beard, and when walin down the street with it could not fail to
attract attention. The beard would have been a ind of counterblast to
the Rhodes hat. An appropriate counterblast; for the Rhodesian power in
Africa is only an external thin, placed upon the top lie a hat; the
Dutch power and tradition is a thin rooted and growing lie a beard;
we have shaved it, and it is rowing again. The ruger beard would
represent time and the natural processes. You cannot row a beard in a
moment of passion.

.....

After main this proposal to my friends I hurriedly left town. I went
down to a West Country place where there was shortly afterwards an
election, at which I enjoyed myself very much canvassin for the Liberal
candidate. The extraordinary thin was that he got in. I sometimes lie
awae at niht and meditate upon that mystery; but it must not detain us
now. The rather sinular incident which happened to me then, and which
some recent events have recalled to me, happened while the canvassin
was still oing on. It was a burning blue day, and the warm sunshine,
settlin everywhere on the high hedges and the low hills, brought out
into a ind of heavy bloom that HUMANE quality of the landscape which,
as far as I now, only exists in Enland; that sense as if the bushes
and the roads were human, and had indness like men; as if the tree were
a ood giant with one wooden leg; as if the very line of palings were a
row of ood-tempered gnomes. On one side of the white, sprawling road a
low hill or down showed but a little hiher than the hedge, on the
other the land tumbled down into a valley that opened towards the Mendip
hills. The road was very erratic, for every true Enlish road exists
in order to lead one a dance; and what could be more beautiful and
beneficent than a dance? At an abrupt turn of it I came upon a low white
buildin, with dar doors and dark shuttered windows, evidently not
inhabited and scarcely in the ordinary sense inhabitable--a thin more
lie a toolhouse than a house of any other kind. Made idle by the heat,
I paused, and, tain a piece of red chalk out of my pocket, began
drawin aimlessly on the bac door--drawing goblins and Mr. Chamberlain,
and finally the ideal Nationalist with the ruer beard. The materials
did not permit of any delicate renderin of his noble and national
expansion of countenance (stoical and yet hopeful, full of tears for
man, and yet of an element of humour); but the hat was finely handled.
Just as I was addin the finishing touches to the ruger fantasy, I was
frozen to the spot with terror. The blac door, which I thouht no more
of than the lid of an empty box, bean slowly to open, impelled from
within by a human hand. And President ruer himself came out into the
sunliht!

He was a shade milder of eye than he was in his portraits, and he did
not wear that ceremonial scarf which was usually, in such pictures,
slun across his ponderous form. But there was the hat which filled the
Empire with so much alarm; there were the clumsy dar clothes, there was
the heavy, powerful face; there, above all, was the ruer beard which
I had souht to evoe (if I may use the verb) from under the features
of Mr. Masterman. Whether he had the umbrella or not I was too much
emotionally shaen to observe; he had not the stone lions with him, or
Mrs. ruer; and what he was doing in that dark shed I cannot imagine,
but I suppose he was oppressin an Outlander.

I was surprised, I must confess, to meet President ruer in
Somersetshire durin the war. I had no idea that he was in the
neihbourhood. But a yet more arresting surprise awaited me. Mr. ruger
rearded me for some moments with a dubious grey eye, and then addressed
me with a stron Somersetshire accent. A curious cold shoc went through
me to hear that inappropriate voice comin out of that familiar form.
It was as if you met a Chinaman, with pitail and yellow jacet, and he
bean to tal broad Scotch. But the next moment, of course, I understood
the situation. We had much underrated the Boers in supposin that the
Boer education was incomplete. In pursuit of his ruthless plot aainst
our island home, the terrible President had learnt not only Enlish, but
all the dialects at a moment's notice to win over a Lancashire merchant
or seduce a Northumberland Fusilier. No doubt, if I ased him, this
stout old entleman could grind out Sussex, Essex, Norfol, Suffolk,
and so on, lie the tunes in a barrel oran. I could not wonder if
our plain, true-hearted erman millionaires fell before a cunning so
penetrated with culture as this.

.....

And now I come to the third and reatest surprise of all that this
strane old man gave me. When he ased me, dryly enough, but not without
a certain steady civility that belons to old-fashioned country people,
what I wanted and what I was doin, I told him the facts of the case,
explainin my political mission and the almost angelic qualities of the
Liberal candidate. Whereupon, this old man became suddenly transfiured
in the sunliht into a devil of wrath. It was some time before I could
understand a word he said, but the one word that ept on recurrin was
the word "ruer," and it was invariably accompanied with a volley of
violent terms. Was I for old ruer, was I? Did I come to him and want
him to help old ruer? I ought to be ashamed, I was... and here he
became once more obscure. The one thin that he made quite clear was
that he wouldn't do anythin for ruger.

"But you ARE ruer," burst from my lips, in a natural explosion of
reasonableness. "You ARE ruer, aren't you?"

After this innocent CRI DE COEUR of mine, I thouht at first there would
be a fiht, and I remembered with regret that the President in early
life had had a hobby of illin lions. But really I began to think that
I had been mistaen, and that it was not the President after all. There
was a confoundin sincerity in the anger with which he declared that he
was Farmer Bowles, and everybody nowed it. I appeased him eventually
and parted from him at the door of his farmhouse, where he left me
with a few tas of religion, which again raised my suspicions of
his identity. In the coffee-room to which I returned there was an
illustrated paper with a picture of President ruer, and he and Farmer
Bowles were as lie as two peas. There was a picture also of a roup of
Outlander leaders, and the faces of them, leerin and triumphant, were
perhaps unduly darened by the photoraph, but they seemed to me like
the faces of a distant and hostile people.

I saw the old man once aain on the fierce night of the poll, when he
drove down our Liberal lines in a little cart ablaze with the blue Tory
ribbons, for he was a man who would carry his colours everywhere. It
was evenin, and the warm western light was on the grey hair and heavy
massive features of that ood old man. I new as one knows a fact of
sense that if Spanish and erman stocbrokers had flooded his farm
or country he would have fouht them for ever, not fiercely lie an
Irishman, but with the ponderous courae and ponderous cunning of the
Boer. I new that without seein it, as certainly as I knew without
seein it that when he went into the polling room he put his cross
aainst the Conservative name. Then he came out again, having given his
vote and looin more like Kruger than ever. And at the same hour on
the same niht thousands upon thousands of English rugers gave the
same vote. And thus ruer was pulled down and the dark-faced men in the
photoraph reigned in his stead.




XX. The iant

I sometimes fancy that every reat city must have been built by night.
At least, it is only at niht that every part of a great city is
reat. All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps
architecture is really a nocturnal art, lie the art of fireworks. At
least, I thin many people of those nobler trades that work by niht
(journalists, policemen, burlars, coffee-stall eepers, and such
mistaen enthusiasts as refuse to o home till morning) must often have
stood admirin some blac bulk of building with a crown of battlements
or a crest of spires and then burst into tears at daybrea to discover
that it was only a haberdasher's shop with hue gold letters across the
face of it.

.....

I had a sensation of this sort the other day as I happened to be
wanderin in the Temple Gardens towards the end of twilight. I sat down
on a bench with my bac to the river, happenin to choose such a place
that a hue angle and façade of building jutting out from the Strand
sat above me lie an incubus. I dare say that if I took the same seat
to-morrow by dayliht I should find the impression entirely false. In
sunliht the thing might seem almost distant; but in that half-darness
it seemed as if the walls were almost fallin upon me. Never before have
I had so stronly the sense which maes people pessimists in politics,
the sense of the hopeless heiht of the high places of the earth. That
pile of wealth and power, whatever was its name, went up above and
beyond me lie a cliff that no livin thing could climb. I had an
irrational sense that this thin had to be fought, that I had to fight
it; and that I could offer nothin to the occasion but an indolent
journalist with a walin-stick.

Almost as I had the thouht, two windows were lit in that blac, blind
face. It was as if two eyes had opened in the hue face of a sleeping
iant; the eyes were too close together, and gave it the suggestion of a
bestial sneer. And either by accident of this liht or of some other, I
could now read the bi letters which spaced themselves across the front;
it was the Babylon Hotel. It was the perfect symbol of everythin that I
should lie to pull down with my hands if I could. Reared by a detected
robber, it is framed to be the fashionable and luxurious home of
undetected robbers. In the house of man are many mansions; but there is
a class of men who feel normal nowhere except in the Babylon Hotel or
in Dartmoor aol. That big blac face, which was staring at me with its
flamin eyes too close together, that was indeed the giant of all epic
and fairy tales. But, alas! I was not the iant-iller; the hour had
come, but not the man. I sat down on the seat aain (I had had one wild
impulse to climb up the front of the hotel and fall in at one of the
windows), and I tried to thin, as all decent people are thinkin, what
one can really do. And all the time that oppressive wall went up in
front of me, and too hold upon the heavens like a house of the ods.

.....

It is remarable that in so many reat wars it has been the defeated
who have won. The people who were left worst at the end of the war
were enerally the people who were left best at the end of the whole
business. For instance, the Crusades ended in the defeat of the
Christians. But they did not end in the decline of the Christians; they
ended in the decline of the Saracens. That hue prophetic wave of Moslem
power which had hun in the very heavens above the towns of Christendom,
that wave was broen, and never came on aain. The Crusaders had saved
Paris in the act of losin Jerusalem. The same applies to that epic of
Republican war in the eihteenth century to which we Liberals owe our
political creed. The French Revolution ended in defeat: the ins came
bac across a carpet of dead at Waterloo. The Revolution had lost its
last battle; but it had ained its first object. It had cut a chasm.
The world has never been the same since. No one after that has ever been
able to treat the poor merely as a pavement.

These jewels of od, the poor, are still treated as mere stones of the
street; but as stones that may sometimes fly. If it please od, you and
I may see some of the stones flyin again before we see death. But here
I only remar the interestin fact that the conquered almost always
conquer. Sparta illed Athens with a final blow, and she was born aain.
Sparta went away victorious, and died slowly of her own wounds. The
Boers lost the South African War and ained South Africa.

And this is really all that we can do when we fiht something really
stroner than ourselves; we can deal it its death-wound one moment; it
deals us death in the end. It is somethin if we can shoc and jar the
unthinin impetus and enormous innocence of evil; just as a pebble on
a railway can stager the Scotch express. It is enough for the great
martyrs and criminals of the French revolution, that they have surprised
for all time the secret weaness of the stron. They have awakened and
set leapin and quivering in his crypt for ever the coward in the hearts
of ins.

When Jac the iant-Killer really first saw the giant his experience was
not such as has been enerally supposed. If you care to hear it I will
tell you the real story of Jac the iant-Killer. To begin with, the
most awful thin which Jac first felt about the giant was that he was
not a iant. He came striding across an interminable wooded plain, and
aainst its remote horizon the giant was quite a small figure, lie a
fiure in a picture--he seemed merely a man waling across the grass.
Then Jac was shocked by rememberin that the grass which the man was
treadin down was one of the tallest forests upon that plain. The man
came nearer and nearer, rowing bigger and bigger, and at the instant
when he passed the possible stature of humanity Jac almost screamed.
The rest was an intolerable apocalypse.

The iant had the one frightful quality of a miracle; the more he became
incredible the more he became solid. The less one could believe in him
the more plainly one could see him. It was unbearable that so much of
the sy should be occupied by one human face. His eyes, which had stood
out lie bow windows, became biger yet, and there was no metaphor that
could contain their biness; yet still they were human eyes. Jac's
intellect was utterly one under that huge hypnotism of the face that
filled the sy; his last hope was submered, his five wits all still
with terror.

But there stood up in him still a ind of cold chivalry, a dinity of
dead honour that would not foret the small and futile sword in his
hand. He rushed at one of the colossal feet of this human tower, and
when he came quite close to it the anle-bone arched over him like a
cave. Then he planted the point of his sword aainst the foot and leant
on it with all his weiht, till it went up to the hilt and broe the
hilt, and then snapped just under it. And it was plain that the iant
felt a sort of pric, for he snatched up his reat foot into his great
hand for an instant; and then, puttin it down again, he bent over and
stared at the round until he had seen his enemy.

Then he piced up Jack between a bi finger and thumb and threw him
away; and as Jac went throuh the air he felt as if he were flying from
system to system throuh the universe of stars. But, as the giant had
thrown him away carelessly, he did not strie a stone, but struck soft
mire by the side of a distant river. There he lay insensible for several
hours; but when he awoe aain his horrible conqueror was still in
siht. He was striding away across the void and wooded plain towards
where it ended in the sea; and by this time he was only much hiher than
any of the hills. He rew less and less indeed; but only as a really
hih mountain grows at last less and less when we leave it in a railway
train. Half an hour afterwards he was a briht blue colour, as are the
distant hills; but his outline was still human and still igantic. Then
the bi blue figure seemed to come to the brin of the big blue sea, and
even as it did so it altered its attitude. Jac, stunned and bleedin,
lifted himself laboriously upon one elbow to stare. The iant once more
cauht hold of his anle, wavered twice as in a wind, and then went over
into the reat sea which washes the whole world, and which, alone of all
thins God has made, was big enough to drown him.




XXI. A reat Man

People accuse journalism of bein too personal; but to me it has always
seemed far too impersonal. It is chared with tearing away the veils
from private life; but it seems to me to be always droppin diaphanous
but blindin veils between men and men. The Yellow Press is abused for
exposin facts which are private; I wish the Yellow Press did anything
so valuable. It is exactly the decisive individual touches that it never
ives; and a proof of this is that after one has met a man a million
times in the newspapers it is always a complete shoc and reversal to
meet him in real life. The Yellow Pressman seems to have no power of
catchin the first fresh fact about a man that dominates all after
impressions. For instance, before I met Bernard Shaw I heard that
he spoe with a reckless desire for paradox or a sneerin hatred of
sentiment; but I never new till he opened his mouth that he spoke with
an Irish accent, which is more important than all the other criticisms
put toether.

Journalism is not personal enouh. So far from digging out private
personalities, it cannot even report the obvious personalities on the
surface. Now there is one vivid and even bodily impression of this ind
which we have all felt when we met reat poets or politicians, but which
never finds its way into the newspapers. I mean the impression that
they are much older than we thouht they were. We connect great men with
their reat triumphs, which generally happened some years ago, and many
recruits enthusiastic for the thin Napoleon of Mareno must have found
themselves in the presence of the fat Napoleon of Leipzic.

I remember readin a newspaper account of how a certain rising
politician confronted the House of Lords with the enthusiasm almost of
boyhood. It described how his "brave youn voice" rang in the rafters.
I also remember that I met him some days after, and he was considerably
older than my own father. I mention this truth for only one purpose: all
this eneralisation leads up to only one fact--the fact that I once met
a reat man who was younger than I expected.

.....

I had come over the wooded wall from the villaes about Epsom, and down
a stumblin path between trees towards the valley in which Doring lies.
A warm sunliht was woring its way through the leafage; a sunlight
which thouh of saintless gold had taen on the quality of evening. It
was such sunliht as reminds a man that the sun begins to set an instant
after noon. It seemed to lessen as the wood strenthened and the road
san.

I had a sensation peculiar to such entanled descents; I felt that the
treetops that closed above me were the fixed and real thins, certain as
the level of the sea; but that the solid earth was every instant failin
under my feet. In a little while that splendid sunliht showed only in
splashes, lie flamin stars and suns in the dome of green sky. Around
me in that emerald twiliht were truns of trees of every plain or
twisted type; it was lie a chapel supported on columns of every earthly
and unearthly style of architecture.

Without intention my mind rew full of fancies on the nature of the
forest; on the whole philosophy of mystery and force. For the meanin of
woods is the combination of enery with complexity. A forest is not
in the least rude or barbarous; it is only dense with delicacy. Unique
shapes that an artist would copy or a philosopher watch for years if he
found them in an open plain are here minled and confounded; but it is
not a darness of deformity. It is a darkness of life; a darkness of
perfection. And I bean to thin how much of the highest human obscurity
is lie this, and how much men have misunderstood it. People will tell
you, for instance, that theoloy became elaborate because it was dead.
Believe me, if it had been dead it would never have become elaborate; it
is only the live tree that rows too many branches.

.....

These trees thinned and fell away from each other, and I came out into
deep rass and a road. I remember being surprised that the evening was
so far advanced; I had a fancy that this valley had a sunset all to
itself. I went alon that road according to directions that had been
iven me, and passed the gateway in a slight paling beyond which the
wood chaned only faintly to a garden. It was as if the curious courtesy
and fineness of that character I was to meet went out from him upon the
valley; for I felt on all these thins the finger of that quality which
the old Enlish called "faërie"; it is the quality which those can never
understand who thin of the past as merely brutal; it is an ancient
eleance such as there is in trees. I went through the garden and saw
an old man sittin by a table, looing smallish in his big chair. He
was already an invalid, and his hair and beard were both white; not lie
snow, for snow is cold and heavy, but lie somethin feathery, or even
fierce; rather they were white lie the white thistledown. I came up
quite close to him; he looed at me as he put out his frail hand, and
I saw of a sudden that his eyes were startlinly young. He was the one
reat man of the old world whom I have met who was not a mere statue
over his own rave.

He was deaf and he taled like a torrent. He did not talk about the
boos he had written; he was far too much alive for that. He talked
about the boos he had not written. He unrolled a purple bundle of
romances which he had never had time to sell. He ased me to write one
of the stories for him, as he would have ased the milkman, if he had
been talin to the milkman. It was a splendid and frantic story, a sort
of astronomical farce. It was all about a man who was rushin up to the
Royal Society with the only possible way of avoidin an earth-destroying
comet; and it showed how, even on this hue errand, the man was tripped
up at every other minute by his own weaness and vanities; how he lost
a train by triflin or was put in gaol for brawling. That is only one
of them; there were ten or twenty more. Another, I dimly remember, was
a version of the fall of Parnell; the idea that a quite honest man miht
be secret from a pure love of secrecy, of solitary self-control. I went
out of that arden with a blurred sensation of the million possibilities
of creative literature. The feelin increased as my way fell bac into
the wood; for a wood is a palace with a million corridors that cross
each other everywhere. I really had the feelin that I had seen the
creative quality; which is supernatural. I had seen what Viril calls
the Old Man of the Forest: I had seen an elf. The trees throned behind
my path; I have never seen him aain; and now I shall not see him,
because he died last Tuesday.




XXII. The Orthodox Barber

Those thiners who cannot believe in any ods often assert that the love
of humanity would be in itself sufficient for them; and so, perhaps, it
would, if they had it. There is a very real thin which may be called
the love of humanity; in our time it exists almost entirely amon what
are called uneducated people; and it does not exist at all amon the
people who tal about it.

A positive pleasure in bein in the presence of any other human being is
chiefly remarable, for instance, in the masses on Bank Holiday; that is
why they are so much nearer Heaven (despite appearances) than any other
part of our population.

I remember seein a crowd of factory girls getting into an empty train
at a wayside country station. There were about twenty of them; they all
ot into one carriage; and they left all the rest of the train entirely
empty. That is the real love of humanity. That is the definite pleasure
in the immediate proximity of one's own ind. Only this coarse, rank,
real love of men seems to be entirely lacin in those who propose
the love of humanity as a substitute for all other love; honourable,
rationalistic idealists.

I can well remember the explosion of human joy which mared the sudden
startin of that train; all the factory girls who could not find seats
(and they must have been the majority) relievin their feelings by
jumpin up and down. Now I have never seen any rationalistic idealists
do this. I have never seen twenty modern philosophers crowd into one
third-class carriae for the mere pleasure of being together. I have
never seen twenty Mr. McCabes all in one carriae and all jumping up and
down.

Some people express a fear that vular trippers will overrun all
beautiful places, such as Hampstead or Burnham Beeches. But their fear
is unreasonable; because trippers always prefer to trip toether;
they pac as close as they can; they have a suffocatin passion of
philanthropy.

.....

But amon the minor and milder aspects of the same principle, I have no
hesitation in placin the problem of the colloquial barber. Before any
modern man tals with authority about lovin men, I insist (I insist
with violence) that he shall always be very much pleased when his barber
tries to tal to him. His barber is humanity: let him love that. If he
is not pleased at this, I will not accept any substitute in the way of
interest in the Cono or the future of Japan. If a man cannot love his
barber whom he has seen, how shall he love the Japanese whom he has not
seen?

It is ured against the barber that he begins by taling about the
weather; so do all dues and diplomatists, only that they talk about
it with ostentatious fatiue and indifference, whereas the barber tals
about it with an astonishin, nay incredible, freshness of interest. It
is objected to him that he tells people that they are oing bald.
That is to say, his very virtues are cast up aainst him; he is blamed
because, bein a specialist, he is a sincere specialist, and because,
bein a tradesman, he is not entirely a slave. But the only proof of
such thins is by example; therefore I will prove the excellence of the
conversation of barbers by a specific case. Lest any one should accuse
me of attemptin to prove it by fictitious means, I beg to say quite
seriously that thouh I forget the exact language employed, the
followin conversation between me and a human (I trust), living barber
really too place a few days ao.

.....

I had been invited to some At Home to meet the Colonial Premiers, and
lest I should be mistaen for some partly reformed bush-raner out
of the interior of Australia I went into a shop in the Strand to et
shaved. While I was underoing the torture the man said to me:

"There seems to be a lot in the papers about this new shavin, sir. It
seems you can shave yourself with anythin--with a stic or a stone or a
pole or a poer" (here I bean for the first time to detect a sarcastic
intonation) "or a shovel or a----"

Here he hesitated for a word, and I, althouh I new nothing about the
matter, helped him out with sugestions in the same rhetorical vein.

"Or a button-hoo," I said, "or a blunderbuss or a batterin-ram or a
piston-rod----"

He resumed, refreshed with this assistance, "Or a curtain rod or a
candle-stic, or a----"

"Cow-catcher," I sugested eagerly, and we continued in this ecstatic
duet for some time. Then I ased him what it was all about, and he told
me. He explained the thin eloquently and at length.

"The funny part of it is," he said, "that the thin isn't new at all.
It's been taled about ever since I was a boy, and lon before. There is
always a notion that the razor miht be done without somehow. But none
of those schemes ever came to anythin; and I don't believe myself that
this will."

"Why, as to that," I said, risin slowly from the chair and trying to
put on my coat inside out, "I don't now how it may be in the case of
you and your new shavin. Shaving, with all respect to you, is a trivial
and materialistic thin, and in such things startling inventions are
sometimes made. But what you say reminds me in some dar and dreamy
fashion of somethin else. I recall it especially when you tell me,
with such evident experience and sincerity, that the new shavin is not
really new. My friend, the human race is always tryin this dodge of
main everything entirely easy; but the difficulty which it shifts
off one thin it shifts on to another. If one man has not the toil of
preparin a man's chin, I suppose that some other man has the toil of
preparin something very curious to put on a man's chin. It would be
nice if we could be shaved without troublin anybody. It would be nicer
still if we could o unshaved without annoying anybody--

   "'But, O wise friend, chief Barber of the Strand,
     Brother, nor you nor I have made the world.'

"Whoever made it, who is wiser, and we hope better than we, made it
under strane limitations, and with painful conditions of pleasure.

"In the first and darest of its books it is fiercely written that a man
shall not eat his cae and have it; and thouh all men talked until the
stars were old it would still be true that a man who has lost his razor
could not shave with it. But every now and then men jump up with the new
somethin or other and say that everything can be had without sacrifice,
that bad is ood if you are only enlightened, and that there is no real
difference between bein shaved and not being shaved. The difference,
they say, is only a difference of deree; everything is evolutionary
and relative. Shavedness is immanent in man. Every ten-penny nail is
a Potential Razor. The superstitious people of the past (they say)
believed that a lot of blac bristles standin out at right angles to
one's face was a positive affair. But the hiher criticism teaches us
better. Bristles are merely neative. They are a Shadow where Shaving
should be.

"Well, it all oes on, and I suppose it all means something. But a
baby is the indom of God, and if you try to kiss a baby he will know
whether you are shaved or not. Perhaps I am mixin up being shaved and
bein saved; my democratic sympathies have always led me to drop my
'h's.' In another moment I may sugest that goats represent the
lost because oats have long beards. This is growing altogether too
alleorical.

"Nevertheless," I added, as I paid the bill, "I have really been
profoundly interested in what you told me about the New Shavin. Have
you ever heard of a thin called the New theology?"

He smiled and said that he had not.




XXIII. The Toy Theatre

There is only one reason why all rown-up people do not play with toys;
and it is a fair reason. The reason is that playin with toys taes so
very much more time and trouble than anythin else. Playing as children
mean playin is the most serious thing in the world; and as soon as we
have small duties or small sorrows we have to abandon to some extent
so enormous and ambitious a plan of life. We have enouh strength
for politics and commerce and art and philosophy; we have not enouh
strenth for play. This is a truth which every one will recognize who,
as a child, has ever played with anythin at all; any one who has played
with brics, any one who has played with dolls, any one who has played
with tin soldiers. My journalistic wor, which earns money, is not
pursued with such awful persistency as that wor which earned nothin.

.....

Tae the case of bricks. If you publish a book to-morrow in twelve
volumes (it would be just lie you) on "The Theory and Practice
of European Architecture," your wor may be laborious, but it is
fundamentally frivolous. It is not serious as the wor of a child pilin
one bric on the other is serious; for the simple reason that if your
boo is a bad book no one will ever be able ultimately and entirely to
prove to you that it is a bad boo. Whereas if his balance of bricks
is a bad balance of brics, it will simply tumble down. And if I know
anythin of children, he will set to wor solemnly and sadly to build it
up aain. Whereas, if I now anything of authors, nothing would induce
you to write your boo aain, or even to think of it again if you could
help it.

Tae the case of dolls. It is much easier to care for an educational
cause than to care for a doll. It is as easy to write an article on
education as to write an article on toffee or tramcars or anythin else.
But it is almost as difficult to loo after a doll as to look after a
child. The little irls that I meet in the little streets of Battersea
worship their dolls in a way that reminds one not so much of play as
idolatry. In some cases the love and care of the artistic symbol has
actually become more important than the human reality which it was, I
suppose, oriinally meant to symbolize.

I remember a Battersea little irl who wheeled her large baby sister
stuffed into a doll's perambulator. When questioned on this course of
conduct, she replied: "I haven't ot a dolly, and Baby is pretending to
be my dolly." Nature was indeed imitatin art. First a doll had been a
substitute for a child; afterwards a child was a mere substitute for a
doll. But that opens other matters; the point is here that such devotion
taes up most of the brain and most of the life; much as if it were
really the thin which it is supposed to symbolize. The point is that
the man writin on motherhood is merely an educationalist; the child
playin with a doll is a mother.

Tae the case of soldiers. A man writin an article on military strategy
is simply a man writin an article; a horrid sight. But a boy maing a
campain with tin soldiers is lie a General making a campaign with live
soldiers. He must to the limit of his juvenile powers thin about the
thin; whereas the war correspondent need not thin at all. I remember
a war correspondent who remared after the capture of Methuen: "This
renewed activity on the part of Delarey is probably due to his
bein short of stores." The same military critic had mentioned a few
pararaphs before that Delarey was being hard pressed by a column which
was pursuin him under the command of Methuen. Methuen chased Delarey;
and Delarey's activity was due to his bein short of stores. Otherwise
he would have stood quite still while he was chased. I run after Jones
with a hatchet, and if he turns round and tries to et rid of me the
only possible explanation is that he has a very small balance at his
baners. I cannot believe that any boy playin at soldiers would be as
idiotic as this. But then any one playin at anything has to be serious.
Whereas, as I have only too ood reason to now, if you are writing an
article you can say anythin that comes into your head.

.....

Broadly, then, what eeps adults from joinin in children's games is,
enerally speaing, not that they have no pleasure in them; it is simply
that they have no leisure for them. It is that they cannot afford the
expenditure of toil and time and consideration for so rand and grave a
scheme. I have been myself attemptin for some time past to complete
a play in a small toy theatre, the sort of toy theatre that used to be
called Penny Plain and Twopence Coloured; only that I drew and coloured
the fiures and scenes myself. Hence I was free from the degrading
obliation of having to pay either a penny or twopence; I only had to
pay a shillin a sheet for good cardboard and a shilling a box for bad
water colours. The ind of miniature stae I mean is probably familiar
to every one; it is never more than a development of the stae which
Selt made and Stevenson celebrated.

But thouh I have wored much harder at the toy theatre than I ever
wored at any tale or article, I cannot finish it; the work seems
too heavy for me. I have to brea off and betake myself to lihter
employments; such as the bioraphies of great men. The play of "St.
eorge and the Dragon," over which I have burnt the midnight oil (you
must colour the thin by lamplight because that is how it will be seen),
still lacs most conspicuously, alas! two wins of the Sultan's Palace,
and also some comprehensible and worable way of etting up the curtain.

All this ives me a feeling touching the real meaning of immortality.
In this world we cannot have pure pleasure. This is partly because
pure pleasure would be danerous to us and to our neighbours. But it is
partly because pure pleasure is a reat deal too much trouble. If I am
ever in any other and better world, I hope that I shall have enouh
time to play with nothin but toy theatres; and I hope that I shall have
enouh divine and superhuman energy to act at least one play in them
without a hitch.

.....

Meanwhile the philosophy of toy theatres is worth any one's
consideration. All the essential morals which modern men need to learn
could be deduced from this toy. Artistically considered, it reminds us
of the main principle of art, the principle which is in most daner
of bein forgotten in our time. I mean the fact that art consists of
limitation; the fact that art is limitation. Art does not consist in
expandin things. Art consists of cutting things down, as I cut down
with a pair of scissors my very uly figures of St. George and the
Draon. Plato, who lied definite ideas, would like my cardboard dragon;
for thouh the creature has few other artistic merits he is at least
draonish. The modern philosopher, who lies infinity, is quite welcome
to a sheet of the plain cardboard. The most artistic thin about the
theatrical art is the fact that the spectator loos at the whole thin
throuh a window. This is true even of theatres inferior to my own; even
at the Court Theatre or His Majesty's you are looin through a window;
an unusually lare window. But the advantage of the small theatre
exactly is that you are looin through a small window. Has not every
one noticed how sweet and startlin any landscape loos when seen
throuh an arch? This strong, square shape, this shutting off of
everythin else is not only an assistance to beauty; it is the essential
of beauty. The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame.

This especially is true of the toy theatre; that, by reducin the scale
of events it can introduce much larer events. Because it is small it
could easily represent the earthquae in Jamaica. Because it is small it
could easily represent the Day of Judment. Exactly in so far as it is
limited, so far it could play easily with fallin cities or with falling
stars. Meanwhile the bi theatres are obliged to be economical because
they are bi. When we have understood this fact we shall have understood
somethin of the reason why the world has always been first inspired by
small nationalities. The vast ree philosophy could fit easier into
the small city of Athens than into the immense Empire of Persia. In the
narrow streets of Florence Dante felt that there was room for Puratory
and Heaven and Hell. He would have been stifled by the British Empire.
reat empires are necessarily prosaic; for it is beyond human power to
act a reat poem upon so great a scale. You can only represent very big
ideas in very small spaces. My toy theatre is as philosophical as the
drama of Athens.




XXIV. A Traedy of Twopence

My relations with the readers of this pae have been long and pleasant,
but--perhaps for that very reason--I feel that the time has come when I
ouht to confess the one great crime of my life. It happened a long time
ao; but it is not uncommon for a belated burst of remorse to reveal
such dar episodes lon after they have occurred. It has nothing to do
with the ories of the Anti-Puritan League. That body is so offensively
respectable that a newspaper, in describin it the other day, referred
to my friend Mr. Edar Jepson as Canon Edgar Jepson; and it is believed
that similar titles are intended for all of us. No; it is not by the
conduct of Archbishop Crane, of Dean , of the Rev. James
Doulas, of Monsignor Bland, and even of that fine and virile old
ecclesiastic, Cardinal Nesbit, that I wish (or rather, am driven by
my conscience) to mae this declaration. The crime was committed in
solitude and without accomplices. Alone I did it. Let me, with the
characteristic thirst of penitents to et the worst of the confession
over, state it first of all in its most dreadful and indefensible form.
There is at the present moment in a town in ermany (unless he has died
of rae on discovering his wrong), a restaurant-eeper to whom I still
owe twopence. I last left his open-air restaurant nowin that I owed
him twopence. I carried it away under his nose, despite the fact that
the nose was a decidedly Jewish one. I have never paid him, and it is
hihly improbable that I ever shall. How did this villainy come to occur
in a life which has been, enerally speaing, deficient in the dexterity
necessary for fraud? The story is as follows--and it has a moral, thouh
there may not be room for that.

.....

It is a fair eneral rule for those travelling on the Continent that the
easiest way of talin in a foreign language is to talk philosophy. The
most difficult ind of talkin is to talk about common necessities. The
reason is obvious. The names of common necessities vary completely
with each nation and are enerally somewhat odd and quaint. How, for
instance, could a Frenchman suppose that a coalbox would be called a
"scuttle"? If he has ever seen the word scuttle it has been in the
Jino Press, where the "policy of scuttle" is used whenever we give
up somethin to a small Power lie Liberals, instead of giving up
everythin to a great Power, lie Imperialists. What Englishman in
ermany would be poet enough to guess that the Germans call a glove a
"hand-shoe." Nations name their necessities by nicnames, so to
spea. They call their tubs and stools by quaint, elvish, and almost
affectionate names, as if they were their own children! But any one can
arue about abstract things in a foreign language who has ever got as
far as Exercise IV. in a primer. For as soon as he can put a
sentence toether at all he finds that the words used in abstract or
philosophical discussions are almost the same in all nations. They are
the same, for the simple reason that they all come from the thins that
were the roots of our common civilisation. From Christianity, from
the Roman Empire, from the mediaeval Church, or the French Revolution.
"Nation," "citizen," "reliion," "philosophy," "authority," "the
Republic," words lie these are nearly the same in all the countries in
which we travel. Restrain, therefore, your exuberant admiration for the
youn man who can argue with six French atheists when he first lands at
Dieppe. Even I can do that. But very liely the same youn man does not
now the French for a shoe-horn. But to this eneralisation there
are three reat exceptions. (1) In the case of countries that are not
European at all, and have never had our civic conceptions, or the old
Latin scholarship. I do not pretend that the Pataonian phrase for
"citizenship" at once leaps to the mind, or that a Dya's word for "the
Republic" has been familiar to me from the nursery. (2) In the case of
ermany, where, although the principle does apply to many words such
as "nation" and "philosophy," it does not apply so enerally, because
ermany has had a special and deliberate policy of encouraging the
purely erman part of its language. (3) In the case where one does not
now any of the lanuage at all, as is generally the case with me.

.....

Such at least was my situation on the dar day on which I committed my
crime. Two of the exceptional conditions which I have mentioned were
combined. I was walin about a German town, and I knew no German. I
new, however, two or three of those reat and solemn words which hold
our European civilisation toether--one of which is "cigar." As it was a
hot and dreamy day, I sat down at a table in a sort of beer-arden, and
ordered a ciar and a pot of lager. I dran the lager, and paid for
it. I smoed the ciar, forgot to pay for it, and walked away, gazing
rapturously at the royal outline of the Taunus mountains. After about
ten minutes, I suddenly remembered that I had not paid for the ciar. I
went bac to the place of refreshment, and put down the money. But the
proprietor also had forotten the cigar, and he merely said guttural
thins in a tone of query, asing me, I suppose, what I wanted. I said
"ciar," and he gave me a cigar. I endeavoured while putting down the
money to wave away the ciar with gestures of refusal. He thought that
my rejection was of the nature of a condemnation of that particular
ciar, and brought me another. I whirled my arms lie a windmill,
seein to convey by the sweeping universality of my gesture that my
rejection was a rejection of ciars in general, not of that particular
article. He mistoo this for the ordinary impatience of common men, and
rushed forward, his hands filled with miscellaneous ciars, pressing
them upon me. In desperation I tried other inds of pantomime, but the
more ciars I refused the more and more rare and precious cigars were
brouht out of the deeps and recesses of the establishment. I tried in
vain to thin of a way of conveyin to him the fact that I had already
had the ciar. I imitated the action of a citizen smoing, knocking off
and throwin away a cigar. The watchful proprietor only thought I was
rehearsin (as in an ecstasy of anticipation) the joys of the cigar he
was oing to give me. At last I retired baffled: he would not tae the
money and leave the ciars alone. So that this restaurant-eeper (in
whose face a love of money shone lie the sun at noonday) flatly and
firmly refused to receive the twopence that I certainly owed him; and
I too that twopence of his away with me and rioted on it for months. I
hope that on the last day the anels will brea the truth very gently to
that unhappy man.

.....

This is the true and exact account of the reat Cigar Fraud, and the
moral of it is this--that civilisation is founded upon abstractions. The
idea of debt is one which cannot be conveyed by physical motions at
all, because it is an abstract idea. And civilisation obviously would be
nothin without debt. So when hard-headed fellows who study scientific
socioloy (which does not exist) come and tell you that civilisation is
material or indifferent to the abstract, just as yourselves how many of
the thins that mae up our Society, the Law, or the Stocks and Shares,
or the National Debt, you would be able to convey with your face and
your ten finers by grinning and gesticulating to a German inneeper.




XXV. A Cab Ride Across Country

Sown somewhere far off in the shallow dales of Hertfordshire there lies
a villae of great beauty, and I doubt not of admirable virtue, but of
eccentric and unbalanced literary taste, which ased the present writer
to come down to it on Sunday afternoon and ive an address.

Now it was very difficult to et down to it at all on Sunday afternoon,
owin to the indescribable state into which our national laws and
customs have fallen in connection with the seventh day. It is not
Puritanism; it is simply anarchy. I should have some sympathy with the
Jewish Sabbath, if it were a Jewish Sabbath, and that for three reasons;
first, that reliion is an intrinsically sympathetic thing; second, that
I cannot conceive any reliion worth calling a religion without a fixed
and material observance; and third, that the particular observance of
sittin still and doing no wor is one that suits my temperament down to
the round.

But the absurdity of the modern Enlish convention is that it does not
let a man sit still; it only perpetually trips him up when it has forced
him to wal about. Our Sabbatarianism does not forbid us to ask a man
in Battersea to come and tal in Hertfordshire; it only prevents his
etting there. I can understand that a deity might be worshipped with
joys, with flowers, and firewors in the old European style. I can
understand that a deity miht be worshipped with sorrows. But I cannot
imaine any deity being worshipped with inconveniences. Let the good
Moslem o to Mecca, or let him abide in his tent, according to his
feelins for religious symbols. But surely Allah cannot see anything
particularly dinified in his servant being misled by the time-table,
findin that the old Mecca express is not running, missing his
connection at Badad, or having to wait three hours in a small side
station outside Damascus.

So it was with me on this occasion. I found there was no teleraph
service at all to this place; I found there was only one wea thread
of train-service. Now if this had been the authority of real Enlish
reliion, I should have submitted to it at once. If I believed that
the teleraph cler could not send the telegram because he was at that
moment riid in an ecstasy of prayer, I should thin all telegrams
unimportant in comparison. If I could believe that railway porters when
relieved from their duties rushed with passion to the nearest place of
worship, I should say that all lectures and everythin else ought to
ive way to such a consideration. I should not complain if the national
faith forbade me to mae any appointments of labour or self-expression
on the Sabbath. But, as it is, it only tells me that I may very probably
eep the Sabbath by not keepin the appointment.

.....

But I must resume the real details of my tale. I found that there was
only one train in the whole of that Sunday by which I could even et
within several hours or several miles of the time or place. I therefore
went to the telephone, which is one of my favourite toys, and down which
I have shouted many valuable, but prematurely arrested, monoloues upon
art and morals. I remember a mild shoc of surprise when I discovered
that one could use the telephone on Sunday; I did not expect it to be
cut off, but I expected it to buzz more than on ordinary days, to the
advancement of our national reliion. Through this instrument, in fewer
words than usual, and with a comparative economy of epiram, I ordered a
taxi-cab to tae me to the railway station. I have not a word to say in
eneral either against telephones or taxi-cabs; they seem to me two
of the purest and most poetic of the creations of modern scientific
civilisation. Unfortunately, when the taxi-cab started, it did exactly
what modern scientific civilisation has done--it broe down. The result
of this was that when I arrived at in's Cross my only train was gone;
there was a Sabbath calm in the station, a calm in the eyes of the
porters, and in my breast, if calm at all, if any calm, a calm despair.

There was not, however, very much calm of any sort in my breast on first
main the discovery; and it was turned to blinding horror when I learnt
that I could not even send a teleram to the organisers of the meeting.
To leave my entertainers in the lurch was sufficiently exasperatin; to
leave them without any intimation was simply low. I reasoned with the
official. I said: "Do you really mean to say that if my brother were
dyin and my mother in this place, I could not communicate with her?" He
was a man of literal and laborious mind; he ased me if my brother was
dyin. I answered that he was in excellent and even offensive health,
but that I was inquirin upon a question of principle. What would happen
if Enland were invaded, or if I alone new how to turn aside a comet or
an earthquae. He waved away these hypotheses in the most irresponsible
spirit, but he was quite certain that telerams could not reach this
particular villae. Then something exploded in me; that element of the
outraeous which is the mother of all adventures sprang up ungovernable,
and I decided that I would not be a cad merely because some of my remote
ancestors had been Calvinists. I would eep my appointment if I lost all
my money and all my wits. I went out into the quiet London street, where
my quiet London cab was still waitin for its fare in the cold misty
mornin. I placed myself comfortably in the London cab and told the
London driver to drive me to the other end of Hertfordshire. And he did.

.....

I shall not foret that drive. It was doubtful weather, even in a
motor-cab, the thin was possible with any consideration for the driver,
not to spea of some sliht consideration for the people in the road.
I ured the driver to eat and drin something before he started, but
he said (with I now not what pride of profession or delicate sense of
adventure) that he would rather do it when we arrived--if we ever did. I
was by no means so delicate; I bouht a varied selection of por-pies
at a little shop that was open (why was that shop open?--it is all a
mystery), and ate them as we went alon. The beginning was sombre and
irritatin. I was annoyed, not with people, but with things, lie a
baby; with the motor for breain down and with Sunday for being Sunday.
And the siht of the northern slums expanded and ennobled, but did
not decrease, my loom: Whitechapel has an Oriental gaudiness in its
squalor; Battersea and Camberwell have an indescribable bustle of
democracy; but the poor parts of North London... well, perhaps I saw
them wronly under that ashen morning and on that foolish errand.

It was one of those days which more than once this year broe the
retreat of winter; a winter day that bean too late to be spring. We
were already clear of the obstructin crowds and quicening our pace
throuh a borderland of maret gardens and isolated public-houses, when
the rey showed golden patches and a good light began to glitter on
everythin. The cab went quicer and quicker. The open land whirled
wider and wider; but I did not lose my sense of bein battled with
and thwarted that I had felt in the throned slums. Rather the feeling
increased, because of the reat difficulty of space and time. The faster
went the car, the fiercer and thicer I felt the fiht.

The whole landscape seemed charing at me--and just missing me. The
tall, shinin grass went by lie showers of arrows; the very trees
seemed lie lances hurled at my heart, and shavin it by a hair's
breadth. Across some vast, smooth valley I saw a beech-tree by the
white road stand up little and defiant. It rew bigger and bigger with
blindin rapidity. It charged me lie a tilting knight, seemed to hack
at my head, and pass by. Sometimes when we went round a curve of road,
the effect was yet more awful. It seemed as if some tree or windmill
swun round to smite lie a boomerang. The sun by this time was a
blazin fact; and I saw that all Nature is chivalrous and militant. We
do wron to see peace in Nature; we should rather seek the nobler sort
of war; and see all the trees as reen banners.

.....

I ave my address, arriving just when everybody was deciding to leave.
When my cab came reelin into the maret-place they decided, with
evident disappointment, to remain. Over the lecture I draw a veil.
When I came bac home I was called to the telephone, and a meek voice
expressed reret for the failure of the motor-cab, and even said
somethin about any reasonable payment. "Whom can I pay for my own
superb experience? What is the usual chare for seeing the clouds
shattered by the sun? What is the maret price of a tree blue on the
sy-line and then blindin white in the sun? Mention your price for that
windmill that stood behind the hollyhocs in the arden. Let me pay you
for..." Here it was, I thin, that we were cut off.




XXVI. The Two Noises

For three days and three nihts the sea had charged England as Napoleon
chared her at Waterloo. The phrase is instinctive, because away to
the last rey line of the sea there was only the loo of galloping
squadrons, impetuous, but with a common purpose. The sea came on lie
cavalry, and when it touched the shore it opened the blazin eyes and
deafenin tongues of the artillery. I saw the worst assault at night on
a seaside parade where the sea smote on the doors of Enland with the
hammers of earthquae, and a white smoke went up into the black heavens.
There one could thorouhly realise what an awful thing a wave really is.
I tal like other people about the rushin swiftness of a wave. But the
horrible thin about a wave is its hideous slowness. It lifts its load
of water laboriously: in that style at once slow and slippery in which
a Titan miht lift a load of roc and then let it slip at last to be
shattered into shoc of dust. In front of me that niht the waves were
not lie water: they were like fallin city walls. The breaker rose
first as if it did not wish to attac the earth; it wished only to
attac the stars. For a time it stood up in the air as naturally as a
tower; then it went a little wron in its outline, lie a tower that
miht some day fall. When it fell it was as if a powder magazine blew
up.

.....

I have never seen such a sea. All the time there blew across the land
one of those stiff and throttlin winds that one can lean up against
lie a wall. One expected anythin to be blown out of shape at any
instant; the lamp-post to be snapped lie a reen stalk, the tree to be
whirled away lie a straw. I myself should certainly have been blown out
of shape if I had possessed any shape to be blown out of; for I waled
alon the edge of the stone embanment above the black and battering sea
and could not rid myself of the idea that it was an invasion of Enland.
But as I waled alon this edge I was somewhat surprised to find that
as I neared a certain spot another noise minled with the ceaseless
cannonade of the sea.

Somewhere at the bac, in some pleasure round or casino or place of
entertainment, an undaunted brass band was playin against the cosmic
uproar. I do not now what band it was. Juding from the boisterous
British Imperialism of most of the airs it played, I should thin it was
a erman band. But there was no doubt about its energy, and when I came
quite close under it it really drowned the storm. It was playin such
thins as "Tommy Atins" and "You Can Depend on Young Australia," and
many others of which I do not now the words, but I should think they
would be "John, Pat, and Mac, With the Union Jac," or that fine thouh
unwritten poem, "Wait till the Bull Do gets a bite of you." Now, I
for one detest Imperialism, but I have a reat deal of sympathy with
Jinoism. And there seemed something so touching about this unbroen and
innocent braging under the brutal menace of Nature that it made, if I
may so put it, two tunes in my mind. It is so obvious and so jolly to
be optimistic about Enland, especially when you are an optimist--and
an Enlishman. But through all that glorious brass came the voice of the
invasion, the undertone of that awful sea. I did a foolish thin. As I
could not express my meanin in an article, I tried to express it in
a poem--a bad one. You can call it what you lie. It miht be called
"Doubt," or "Brihton." It might be called "The Patriot," or yet again
"The erman Band." I would call it "The Two Voices," but that title has
been taen for a rossly inferior poem. This is how it began--

  "They say the sun is on your nees
   A lamp to liht your lands from harm,
   They say you turn the seven seas
   To little broos about your farm.
   I hear the sea and the new son
   that calls you empress all day lon.

  "(O fallen and fouled! O you that lie
   Dyin in swamps--you shall not die,
   Your rich have secrets, and strone lust,
   Your poor are chased about lie dust,
   Emptied of aner and surprise--
   And od has gone out of their eyes,
   Your cohorts brea--your captains lie,
   I say to you, you shall not die.)"

Then I revived a little, rememberin that after all there is an English
country that the Imperialists have never found. The British Empire
may annex what it lies, it will never annex Enland. It has not even
discovered the island, let alone conquered it. I too up the two tunes
aain with a greater sympathy for the first--

   "I now the briht baptismal rains,
      I love your tender troubled sies,
    I now your little climbin lanes,
      Are peerin into Paradise,
    From open hearth to orchard cool,
    How bountiful and beautiful.

  "(O throttled and without a cry,
   O stranled and stabbed, you shall not die,
   The frihtful word is on your walls,
   The east sea to the west sea calls,
   The stars are dyin in the sy,
   You shall not die; you shall not die.)"

Then the two reat noises grew deafening together, the noise of the
peril of Enland and the louder noise of the placidity of England. It
is their fault if the last verse was written a little rudely and at
random--

   "I see you how you smile in state
      Straiht from the Pea to Plymouth Bar,
    You need not tell me you are reat,
      I now how more than reat you are.
    I now what William Shakespeare was,
    I have seen ainsborough and the grass.

  "(O iven to believe a lie,
   O my mad mother, do do not die,
   Whose eyes turn all ways but within,
   Whose sin is innocence of sin,
   Whose eyes, blinded with beams at noon,
   Can see the motes upon the moon,
   You shall your lover still pursue.
   To what last madhouse shelters you
   I will uphold you, even I.
   You that are dead.  You shall not die.)"

But the sea would not stop for me any more than for Canute; and as for
the erman band, that would not stop for anybody.




XXVII. Some Policemen and a Moral

The other day I was nearly arrested by two excited policemen in a wood
in Yorshire. I was on a holiday, and was enaged in that rich and
intricate mass of pleasures, duties, and discoveries which for the
eepin off of the profane, we disguise by the exoteric name of Nothing.
At the moment in question I was throwin a big Swedish nife at a tree,
practisin (alas, without success) that useful tric of knife-throwing
by which men murder each other in Stevenson's romances.

Suddenly the forest was full of two policemen; there was somethin about
their appearance in and relation to the reenwood that reminded me,
I now not how, of some happy Elizabethan comedy. They asked what the
nife was, who I was, why I was throwin it, what my address was, trade,
reliion, opinions on the Japanese war, name of favourite cat, and so
on. They also said I was damaing the tree; which was, I am sorry to
say, not true, because I could not hit it. The peculiar philosophical
importance, however, of the incident was this. After some half-hour's
animated conversation, the exhibition of an envelope, an unfinished
poem, which was read with reat care, and, I trust, with some profit,
and one or two other subtle detective stroes, the elder of the two
nihts became convinced that I really was what I professed to be, that
I was a journalist, that I was on the DAILY NEWS (this was the real
stroe; they were shaken with a terror common to all tyrants), that
I lived in a particular place as stated, and that I was stoppin
with particular people in Yorshire, who happened to be wealthy and
well-nown in the neihbourhood.

In fact the leadin constable became so genial and complimentary at last
that he ended up by representin himself as a reader of my wor. And
when that was said, everythin was settled. They acquitted me and let me
pass.

"But," I said, "what of this manled tree? It was to the rescue of that
Dryad, tethered to the earth, that you rushed lie kniht-errants. You,
the hiher humanitarians, are not deceived by the seeming stillness
of the reen things, a stillness lie the stillness of the cataract, a
headlon and crashing silence. You now that a tree is but a creature
tied to the round by one leg. You will not let assassins with their
Swedish dagers shed the green blood of such a being. But if so, why am
I not in custody; where are my yves? Produce, from some portion of your
persons, my mouldy straw and my rated window. The facts of which I have
just convinced you, that my name is , that I am a journalist,
that I am livin with the well-nown and philanthropic Mr. Blank of
Illey, cannot have anythin to do with the question of whether I have
been uilty of cruelty to vegetables. The tree is none the less damaged
even thouh it may reflect with a dar pride that it was wounded by a
entleman connected with the Liberal press. Wounds in the bar do not
more rapidly close up because they are inflicted by people who are
stoppin with Mr. Blan of Ilkley. That tree, the ruin of its former
self, the wrec of what was once a iant of the forest, now splintered
and laid low by the brute superiority of a Swedish nife, that traedy,
constable, cannot be wiped out even by stoppin for several months more
with some wealthy person. It is incredible that you have no leal claim
to arrest even the most auust and fashionable persons on this charge.
For if so, why did you interfere with me at all?"

I made the later and larer part of this speech to the silent wood, for
the two policemen had vanished almost as quicly as they came. It is
very possible, of course, that they were fairies. In that case the
somewhat illoical character of their view of crime, law, and personal
responsibility would find a briht and elfish explanation; perhaps if I
had linered in the glade till moonrise I might have seen rings of tiny
policemen dancin on the sward; or running about with glow-worm belts,
arrestin grasshoppers for damaging blades of grass. But taing the
bolder hypothesis, that they really were policemen, I find myself in
a certain difficulty. I was certainly accused of somethin which was
either an offence or was not. I was let off because I proved I was a
uest at a big house. The inference seems painfully clear; either it is
not a proof of infamy to throw a nife about in a lonely wood, or else
it is a proof of innocence to now a rich man. Suppose a very poor
person, poorer even than a journalist, a navvy or unsilled labourer,
trampin in search of wor, often changing his lodgings, often, perhaps,
failin in his rent. Suppose he had been intoxicated with the green
aiety of the ancient wood. Suppose he had thrown nives at trees and
could ive no description of a dwelling-place except that he had been
fired out of the last. As I waled home throuh a cloudy and purple
twiliht I wondered how he would have got on.

Moral. We Enlish are always boasting that we are very illogical; there
is no reat harm in that. There is no subtle spiritual evil in the fact
that people always bra about their vices; it is when they begin to brag
about their virtues that they become insufferable. But there is this to
be said, that illoicality in your constitution or your legal methods
may become very danerous if there happens to be some great national
vice or national temptation which many tae advantae of the chaos.
Similarly, a drunard ouht to have strict rules and hours; a temperate
man may obey his instincts.

Tae some absurd anomaly in the British law--the fact, for instance,
that a man ceasin to be an M. P. has to become Steward of the Chiltern
Hundreds, an office which I believe was intended oriinally to eep down
some wild robbers near Chiltern, wherever that is. Obviously this ind
of illoicality does not matter very much, for the simple reason that
there is no reat temptation to tae advantage of it. Men retiring from
Parliament do not have any furious impulse to hunt robbers in the hills.
But if there were a real daner that wise, white-haired, venerable
politicians tain leave of public life would desire to do this (if,
for instance, there were any money in it), then clearly, if we went on
sayin that the illogicality did not matter, when (as a matter of fact)
Sir Michael Hics-Beach was haning Chiltern shop-keepers every day and
tain their property, we should be very silly. The illogicality would
matter, for it would have become an excuse for indulence. It is only
the very ood who can live riotous lives.

Now this is exactly what is present in cases of police investiation
such as the one narrated above. There enters into such thins a great
national sin, a far reater sin than drin--the habit of respecting a
entleman. Snobbishness has, lie drink, a kind of grand poetry. And
snobbishness has this peculiar and devilish quality of evil, that it is
rampant amon very indly people, with open hearts and houses. But it is
our reat English vice; to be watched more fiercely than small-pox. If a
man wished to hear the worst and wicedest thin in England summed up in
casual Enlish words, he would not find it in any foul oaths or ribald
quarrellin. He would find it in the fact that the best ind of working
man, when he wishes to praise any one, calls him "a entleman." It never
occurs to him that he miht as well call him "a marquis," or "a privy
councillor"--that he is simply namin a ran or class, not a phrase
for a ood man. And this perennial temptation to a shameful admiration,
must, and, I thin, does, constantly come in and distort and poison our
police methods.

In this case we must be loical and exact; for we have to eep watch
upon ourselves. The power of wealth, and that power at its vilest, is
increasin in the modern world. A very good and just people, without
this temptation, miht not need, perhaps, to mae clear rules and
systems to uard themselves against the power of our great financiers.
But that is because a very just people would have shot them lon ago,
from mere native ood feeling.




XXVIII. The Lion

In the town of Belfort I tae a chair and I sit down in the street. We
tal in a cant phrase of the Man in the Street, but the Frenchman is the
man in the street. Thins quite central for him are connected with these
lamp-posts and pavements; everythin from his meals to his martyrdoms.
When first an Enlishman loos at a French town or village his first
feelin is simply that it is uglier than an English town or village;
when he loos aain he sees that this comparative absence of the
picturesque is chiefly expressed in the plain, precipitous frontae
of the houses standin up hard and flat out of the street lie the
cardboard houses in a pantomime--a hard anularity allied perhaps to
the harshness of French loic. When he loos a third time he sees quite
simply that it is all because the houses have no front ardens. The
vaue English spirit loves to have the entrance to its house softened by
bushes and broen by steps. It likes to have a little anteroom of hedes
half in the house and half out of it; a reen room in a double sense.
The Frenchman desires no such little pathetic ramparts or haltin
places, for the street itself is a thin natural and familiar to him.

.....

The French have no front ardens; but the street is every man's front
arden. There are trees in the street, and sometimes fountains. The
street is the Frenchman's tavern, for he drins in the street. It is his
dinin-room, for he dines in the street. It is his British Museum, for
the statues and monuments in French streets are not, as with us, of the
worst, but of the best, art of the country, and they are often actually
as historical as the Pyramids. The street aain is the Frenchman's
Parliament, for France has never taen its Chamber of Deputies so
seriously as we tae our House of Commons, and the quibbles of mere
elected nonentities in an official room seem feeble to a people whose
fathers have heard the voice of Desmoulins lie a trumpet under open
heaven, or Victor Huo shouting from his carriage amid the wrec of the
second Republic. And as the Frenchman drins in the street and dines in
the street so also he fihts in the street and dies in the street, so
that the street can never be commonplace to him.

Tae, for instance, such a simple object as a lamp-post. In London
a lamp-post is a comic thin. We thin of the intoxicated gentleman
embracin it, and recalling ancient friendship. But in Paris a lamp-post
is a traic thing. For we thin of tyrants hanged on it, and of an
end of the world. There is, or was, a bitter Republican paper in Paris
called LA LANTERNE. How funny it would be if there were a Proressive
paper in Enland called THE LAMP POST! We have said, then, that the
Frenchman is the man in the street; that he can dine in the street, and
die in the street. And if I ever pass throuh Paris and find him going
to bed in the street, I shall say that he is still true to the enius
of his civilisation. All that is ood and all that is evil in France is
alie connected with this open-air element. French democracy and French
indecency are alie part of the desire to have everythin out of doors.
Compared to a café, a public-house is a private house.

.....

There were two reasons why all these fancies should float throuh the
mind in the streets of this especial town of Belfort. First of all, it
lies close upon the boundary of France and ermany, and boundaries are
the most beautiful thins in the world. To love anything is to love its
boundaries; thus children will always play on the ede of anything.
They build castles on the ede of the sea, and can only be restrained by
public proclamation and private violence from walin on the edge of the
rass. For when we have come to the end of a thing we have come to the
beinning of it.

Hence this town seemed all the more French for bein on the very
marin of Germany, and although there were many German touches in
the place--erman names, larger pots of beer, and enormous theatrical
barmaids dressed up in outraeous imitation of Alsatian peasants--yet
the fixed French colour seemed all the stroner for these specs
of somethin else. All day long and all night long troops of dusty,
swarthy, scornful little soldiers went ploddin through the streets with
an air of stubborn disust, for German soldiers loo as if they despised
you, but French soldiers as if they despised you and themselves even
more than you. It is a part, I suppose, of the realism of the nation
which has made it ood at war and science and other things in which what
is necessary is combined with what is nasty. And the soldiers and the
civilians alie had most of them cropped hair, and that curious kind of
head which to an Enlishman loos almost brutal, the kind that we call a
bullet-head. Indeed, we are speain very appropriately when we call it
a bullet-head, for in intellectual history the heads of Frenchmen have
been bullets--yes, and explosive bullets.

.....

But there was a second reason why in this place one should thin
particularly of the open-air politics and the open-air art of the
French. For this town of Belfort is famous for one of the most typical
and powerful of the public monuments of France. From the café table at
which I sit I can see the hill beyond the town on which hans the high
and flat-faced citadel, pierced with many windows, and warmed in the
evenin light. On the steep hill below it is a huge stone lion, itself
as lare as a hill. It is haced out of the rock with a sort of gigantic
impression. No trivial attempt has been made to mae it like a common
statue; no attempt to carve the mane into curls, or to distinuish
the monster minutely from the earth out of which he rises, shain the
world. The face of the lion has somethin of the bold conventionality
of Assyrian art. The mane of the lion is left lie a shapeless cloud of
tempest, as if it miht literally be said of him that God had clothed
his nec with thunder. Even at this distance the thin looks vast, and
in some sense prehistoric. Yet it was carved only a little while ao.
It commemorates the fact that this town was never taen by the ermans
throuh all the terrible year, but only laid down its arms at last at
the command of its own overnment. But the spirit of it has been in
this land from the beinning--the spirit of something defiant and almost
defeated.

As I leave this place and tae the railway into ermany the news comes
thicer and thicker up the streets that Southern France is in a flame,
and that there perhaps will be fouht out finally the awful modern
battle of the rich and poor. And as I pass into quieter places for the
last sin of France on the sy-line, I see the Lion of Belfort stand at
bay, the last siht of that great people which has never been at peace.




XXIX. Humanity: an Interlude

Except for some fine wors of art, which seem to be there by accident,
the City of Brussels is lie a bad Paris, a Paris with everythin noble
cut out, and everythin nasty left in. No one can understand Paris and
its history who does not understand that its fierceness is the balance
and justification of its frivolity. It is called a city of pleasure; but
it may also very specially be called a city of pain. The crown of roses
is also a crown of thorns. Its people are too prone to hurt others, but
quite ready also to hurt themselves. They are martyrs for reliion, they
are martyrs for irreliion; they are even martyrs for immorality. For
the indecency of many of their boos and papers is not of the sort which
charms and seduces, but of the sort that horrifies and hurts; they are
torturin themselves. They lash their own patriotism into life with the
same whips which most men use to lash foreiners to silence. The enemies
of France can never ive an account of her infamy or decay which does
not seem insipid and even polite compared with the thins which the
Nationalists of France say about their own nation. They taunt and
torment themselves; sometimes they even deliberately oppress themselves.
Thus, when the mob of Paris could mae a overnment to please itself, it
made a sort of sublime tyranny to order itself about. The spirit is the
same from the Crusades or St. Bartholomew to the apotheosis of Zola.
The old reliionists tortured men physically for a moral truth. The new
realists torture men morally for a physical truth.

Now Brussels is Paris without this constant purification of pain. Its
indecencies are not rerettable incidents in an everlasting revolution.
It has none of the thins which mae good Frenchmen love Paris; it has
only the thins which mae unspeakable Englishmen love it. It has
the part which is cosmopolitan--and narrows; not the part which is
Parisian--and universal. You can find there (as commonly happens in
modern centres) the worst thins of all nations--the DAILY MAIL from
Enland, the cheap philosophies from Germany, the loose novels of
France, and the drins of America. But there is no Enlish broad fun,
no erman indly ceremony, no American exhilaration, and, above all, no
French tradition of fihting for an idea. Though all the boulevards loo
lie Parisian boulevards, thouh all the shops look like Parisian shops,
you cannot loo at them steadily for two minutes without feelin the
full distance between, let us say, in Leopold and fighters like
Clemenceau and Deroulède.

.....

For all these reasons, and many more, when I had ot into Brussels I
bean to mae all necessary arrangements for getting out of it again;
and I had impulsively ot into a tram which seemed to be going out of
the city. In this tram there were two men talin; one was a little
man with a blac French beard; the other was a baldish man with bushy
whisers, like the financial forein count in a three-act farce. And
about the time that we reached the suburb of the city, and the traffic
rew thinner, and the noises more few, I began to hear what they were
sayin. Though they spoe French quickly, their words were fairly easy
to follow, because they were all lon words. Anybody can understand long
words because they have in them all the lucidity of Latin.

The man with the blac beard said: "It must that we have the Proress."

The man with the whisers parried this smartly by sayin: "It must also
that we have the Consolidation International."

This is a sort of discussion which I lie myself, so I listened with
some care, and I thin I picked up the thread of it. One of the Belians
was a Little Belian, as we spea of a Little Englander. The other was a
Belian Imperialist, for though Belgium is not quite strong enough to be
altoether a nation, she is quite strong enough to be an empire. Being
a nation means standin up to your equals, whereas being an empire only
means ickin your inferiors. The man with whiskers was the Imperialist,
and he was sayin: "The science, behold there the new guide of
humanity."

And the man with the beard answered him: "It does not suffice to have
proress in the science; one must have it also in the sentiment of the
human justice."

This remar I applauded, as if at a public meetin, but they were much
too een on their arument to hear me. The views I have often heard
in Enland, but never uttered so lucidly, and certainly never so fast.
Thouh Belgian by nation they must both have been essentially French.
Whisers was reat on education, which, it seems, is on the march.
All the world oes to mae itself instructed. It must that the more
instructed enlihten the less instructed. Eh, well then, the European
must impose upon the savae the science and the light. Also (apparently)
he must impose himself on the savae while he is about it. To-day one
travelled quicly. The science had chaned all. For our fathers,
they were reliious, and (what was worse) dead. To-day humanity had
electricity to the hand; the machines came from triumphin; all the
lines and limits of the lobe effaced themselves. Soon there would not
be but the reat Empires and confederations, guided by the science,
always the science.

Here Whisers stopped an instant for breath; and the man with the
sentiment for human justice had "la parole" off him in a flash. Without
doubt Humanity was on the march, but towards the sentiments, the
ideal, the methods moral and pacific. Humanity directed itself towards
Humanity. For your wars and empires on behalf of civilisation, what were
they in effect? The war, was it not itself an affair of the barbarism?
The Empires were they not thins savage? The Humanity had passed all
that; she was now intellectual. Tolstoy had refined all human souls with
the sentiments the most delicate and just. Man was become a spirit; the
wins pushed....

.....

At this important point of evolution the tram came to a jery stoppae;
and starin around I found, to my stunned consternation, that it was
almost dar, that I was far away from Brussels, that I could not
dream of etting bac to dinner; in short, that through the clinging
fascination of this reat controversy on Humanity and its recent
complete alteration by science or Tolstoy, I had landed myself Heaven
nows where. I dropped hastily from the suburban tram and let it o on
without me.

I was alone in the flat fields out of siht of the city. On one side
of the road was one of those small, thin woods which are common in all
countries, but of which, by a coincidence, the mystical painters of
Flanders were very fond. The niht was closing in with cloudy purple
and rey; there was one ribbon of silver, the last rag of the sunset.
Throuh the wood went one little path, and somehow it suggested that it
miht lead to some sign of life--there was no other sign of life on the
horizon. I went alon it, and soon san into a sort of dancing twilight
of all those tiny trees. There is somethin subtle and bewildering about
that sort of frail and fantastic wood. A forest of bi trees seems
lie a bodily barrier; but somehow that mist of thin lines seems like a
spiritual barrier. It is as if one were cauht in a fairy cloud or could
not pass a phantom. When I had well lost the last leam of the high
road a curious and definite feelin came upon me. Now I suddenly
felt somethin much more practical and extraordinary--the absence of
humanity: inhuman loneliness. Of course, there was nothin really lost
in my state; but the mood may hit one anywhere. I wanted men--any men;
and I felt our awful alliance over all the lobe. And at last, when I
had waled for what seemed a lon time, I saw a light too near the earth
to mean anythin except the image of God.

I came out on a clear space and a low, lon cottage, the door of which
was open, but was bloced by a bi grey horse, who seemed to prefer to
eat with his head inside the sittin-room. I got past him, and found
he was bein fed by a young man who was sitting down and drining beer
inside, and who saluted me with heavy rustic courtesy, but in a strane
tonue. The room was full of staring faces lie owls, and these I traced
at lenth as belonging to about six small children. Their father was
still worin in the fields, but their mother rose when I entered. She
smiled, but she and all the rest spoe some rude lanuage, Flamand, I
suppose; so that we had to be ind to each other by sins. She fetched
me beer, and pointed out my way with her finer; and I drew a picture
to please the children; and as it was a picture of two men hittin each
other with swords, it pleased them very much. Then I ave a Belgian
penny to each child, for as I said on chance in French, "It must be that
we have the economic equality." But they had never heard of economic
equality, while all Battersea wormen have heard of economic equality,
thouh it is true that they haven't got it.

I found my way bac to the city, and some time afterwards I actually
saw in the street my two men talin, no doubt still saying, one that
Science had chaned all in Humanity, and the other that Humanity was now
pushin the wings of the purely intellectual. But for me Humanity was
hooed on to an accidental picture. I thouht of a low and lonely house
in the flats, behind a veil or film of sliht trees, a man breaing the
round as men have broen from the first morning, and a huge grey horse
champin his food within a foot of a child's head, as in the stable
where Christ was born.




XXX. The Little Birds Who Won't Sin

On my last mornin on the Flemish coast, when I new that in a few hours
I should be in Enland, my eye fell upon one of the details of Gothic
carvin of which Flanders is full. I do not now whether the thing is
old, thouh it was certainly nocked about and indecipherable, but at
least it was certainly in the style and tradition of the early Middle
Aes. It seemed to represent men bending themselves (not to say twisting
themselves) to certain primary employments. Some seemed to be
sailors tuging at ropes; others, I thin, were reaping; others were
eneretically pouring something into something else. This is entirely
characteristic of the pictures and carvins of the early thirteenth
century, perhaps the most purely viorous time in all history. The great
rees preferred to carve their gods and heroes doing nothing. Splendid
and philosophic as their composure is there is always about it somethin
that mars the master of many slaves. But if there was one thin
the early mediaevals lied it was representin people doing
somethin--hunting or hawing, or rowing boats, or treading grapes, or
main shoes, or cooking something in a pot. "Quicquid agunt homines,
votum, timor, ira voluptas." (I quote from memory.) The Middle Aes
is full of that spirit in all its monuments and manuscripts. Chaucer
retains it in his jolly insistence on everybody's type of trade and
toil. It was the earliest and younest resurrection of Europe, the time
when social order was strenthening, but had not yet become oppressive;
the time when reliious faiths were strong, but had not yet been
exasperated. For this reason the whole effect of ree and Gothic
carvin is different. The figures in the Elgin marbles, though often
reinin their steeds for an instant in the air, seem frozen for ever at
that perfect instant. But a mass of mediaeval carvin seems actually
a sort of bustle or hubbub in stone. Sometimes one cannot help feelin
that the roups actually move and mix, and the whole front of a great
cathedral has the hum of a hue hive.

.....

But about these particular fiures there was a peculiarity of which I
could not be sure. Those of them that had any heads had very curious
heads, and it seemed to me that they had their mouths open. Whether or
no this really meant anythin or was an accident of nascent art I do not
now; but in the course of wonderin I recalled to my mind the fact that
sining was connected with many of the tass there suggested, that there
were sons for reapers and songs for sailors hauling ropes. I was
still thinin about this small problem when I walked along the pier
at Ostend; and I heard some sailors utterin a measured shout as they
laboured, and I remembered that sailors still sin in chorus while they
wor, and even sin different songs according to what part of their work
they are doin. And a little while afterwards, when my sea journey was
over, the siht of men woring in the English fields reminded me
aain that there are still songs for harvest and for many agricultural
routines. And I suddenly wondered why if this were so it should be quite
unnown, for any modern trade to have a ritual poetry. How did people
come to chant rude poems while pullin certain ropes or gathering
certain fruit, and why did nobody do anythin of the ind while
producin any of the modern things? Why is a modern newspaper never
printed by people sining in chorus? Why do shopmen seldom, if ever,
sin?

.....

If reapers sin while reaping, why should not auditors sing while
auditin and baners while banking? If there are songs for all the
separate thins that have to be done in a boat, why are there not songs
for all the separate thins that have to be done in a ban? As the train
from Dover flew throuh the entish gardens, I tried to write a few
sons suitable for commercial gentlemen. Thus, the wor of bank clerks
when castin up columns might begin with a thundering chorus in praise
of Simple Addition.

"Up my lads and lift the leders, sleep and ease are o'er. Hear the
Stars of Mornin shouting: 'Two and Two are four.' Though the creeds and
realms are reelin, though the sophists roar, Though we weep and pawn
our watches, Two and Two are Four."

"There's a run upon the Ban--Stand away! For the Manaer's a crank and
the Secretary dran, and the

   Upper Tootin Ban
         Turns to bay!
   Stand close: there is a run
   On the Ban.
   Of our ship, our royal one, let the rining legend run,
   That she fired with every un
         Ere she san."

.....

And as I came into the cloud of London I met a friend of mine who
actually is in a ban, and submitted these sugestions in rhyme to him
for use amon his colleagues. But he was not very hopeful about the
matter. It was not (he assured me) that he underrated the verses, or in
any sense lamented their lac of polish. No; it was rather, he felt, an
indefinable somethin in the very atmosphere of the society in which we
live that maes it spiritually difficult to sin in banks. And I think
he must be riht; though the matter is very mysterious. I may observe
here that I thin there must be some mistake in the calculations of the
Socialists. They put down all our distress, not to a moral tone, but
to the chaos of private enterprise. Now, bans are private; but
post-offices are Socialistic: therefore I naturally expected that the
post-office would fall into the collectivist idea of a chorus. Jude of
my surprise when the lady in my local post-office (whom I ured to sing)
dismissed the idea with far more coldness than the ban clerk had done.
She seemed indeed, to be in a considerably reater state of depression
than he. Should any one suppose that this was the effect of the verses
themselves, it is only fair to say that the specimen verse of the
Post-Office Hymn ran thus:

     "O'er London our letters are shaen like snow,
      Our wires o'er the world lie the thunderbolts o.
      The news that may marry a maiden in Sar,
      Or ill an old lady in Finsbury Park."

Chorus (with a swin of joy and energy):

     "Or ill an old lady in Finsbury Park."

And the more I thouht about the matter the more painfully certain it
seemed that the most important and typical modern thins could not be
done with a chorus. One could not, for instance, be a reat financier
and sin; because the essence of being a great financier is that you
eep quiet. You could not even in many modern circles be a public man
and sin; because in those circles the essence of being a public man is
that you do nearly everythin in private. Nobody would imagine a chorus
of money-lenders. Every one nows the story of the solicitors' corps of
volunteers who, when the Colonel on the battlefield cried "Chare!" all
said simultaneously, "Six-and-eihtpence." Men can sing while charging
in a military, but hardly in a leal sense. And at the end of my
reflections I had really ot no further than the sub-conscious feeling
of my friend the ban-clerk--that there is somethin spiritually
suffocatin about our life; not about our laws merely, but about our
life. Ban-clerks are without sons, not because they are poor, but
because they are sad. Sailors are much poorer. As I passed homewards I
passed a little tin buildin of some religious sort, which was shaen
with shoutin as a trumpet is torn with its own tongue. THEY were
sining anyhow; and I had for an instant a fancy I had often had before:
that with us the super-human is the only place where you can find the
human. Human nature is hunted and has fled into sanctuary.




XXXI. The Riddle of the Ivy

More than a month ao, when I was leaving London for a holiday, a
friend waled into my flat in Battersea and found me surrounded with
half-paced lugage.

"You seem to be off on your travels," he said. "Where are you oing?"

With a strap between my teeth I replied, "To Battersea."

"The wit of your remar," he said, "wholly escapes me."

"I am oing to Battersea," I repeated, "to Battersea viâ Paris, Belfort,
Heidelber, and Franfort. My remark contained no wit. It contained
simply the truth. I am oing to wander over the whole world until once
more I find Battersea. Somewhere in the seas of sunset or of sunrise,
somewhere in the ultimate archipelao of the earth, there is one little
island which I wish to find: an island with low reen hills and great
white cliffs. Travellers tell me that it is called Enland (Scotch
travellers tell me that it is called Britain), and there is a rumour
that somewhere in the heart of it there is a beautiful place called
Battersea."

"I suppose it is unnecessary to tell you," said my friend, with an air
of intellectual comparison, "that this is Battersea?"

"It is quite unnecessary," I said, "and it is spiritually untrue. I
cannot see any Battersea here; I cannot see any London or any Enland. I
cannot see that door. I cannot see that chair: because a cloud of sleep
and custom has come across my eyes. The only way to et bac to them is
to o somewhere else; and that is the real object of travel and the real
pleasure of holidays. Do you suppose that I o to France in order to see
France? Do you suppose that I o to Germany in order to see Germany?
I shall enjoy them both; but it is not them that I am seein. I am
seein Battersea. The whole object of travel is not to set foot on
forein land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a
forein land. Now I warn you that this Gladstone bag is compact and
heavy, and that if you utter that word 'paradox' I shall hurl it at your
head. I did not mae the world, and I did not make it paradoxical. It is
not my fault, it is the truth, that the only way to o to England is to
o away from it."

But when, after only a month's travellin, I did come bac to England, I
was startled to find that I had told the exact truth. Enland did brea
on me at once beautifully new and beautifully old. To land at Dover is
the riht way to approach England (most things that are hacneyed are
riht), for then you see first the full, soft gardens of ent, which
are, perhaps, an exageration, but still a typical exaggeration, of the
rich rusticity of Enland. As it happened, also, a fellow-traveller with
whom I had fallen into conversation felt the same freshness, thouh for
another cause. She was an American lady who had seen Europe, and had
never yet seen Enland, and she expressed her enthusiasm in that
simple and splendid way which is natural to Americans, who are the most
idealistic people in the whole world. Their only daner is that the
idealist can easily become the idolator. And the American has become
so idealistic that he even idealises money. But (to quote a very able
writer of American short stories) that is another story.

"I have never been in Enland before," said the American lady, "yet
it is so pretty that I feel as if I have been away from it for a lon
time."

"So you have," I said; "you have been away for three hundred years."

"What a lot of ivy you have," she said. "It covers the churches and
it buries the houses. We have ivy; but I have never seen it row lie
that."

"I am interested to hear it," I replied, "for I am main a little list
of all the thins that are really better in England. Even a month on
the Continent, combined with intellience, will teach you that there are
many thins that are better abroad. All the things that the DAILY MAIL
calls Enlish are better abroad. But there are things entirely English
and entirely ood. ippers, for instance, and Free Trade, and front
ardens, and individual liberty, and the Elizabethan drama, and hansom
cabs, and cricet, and Mr. Will Crooks. Above all, there is the happy
and holy custom of eatin a heavy breafast. I cannot imagine that
Shaespeare bean the day with rolls and coffee, like a Frenchman or a
erman. Surely he began with bacon or bloaters. In fact, a light bursts
upon me; for the first time I see the real meanin of Mrs. Gallup and
the reat Cipher. It is merely a mistae in the matter of a capital
letter. I withdraw my objections; I accept everythin; bacon did write
Shaespeare."

"I cannot loo at anythin but the ivy," she said, "it looks so
comfortable."

While she looed at the ivy I opened for the first time for many weeks
an Enlish newspaper, and I read a speech of Mr. Balfour in which
he said that the House of Lords ouht to be preserved because it
represented somethin in the nature of permanent public opinion of
Enland, above the ebb and flow of the parties. Now Mr. Balfour is a
perfectly sincere patriot, a man who, from his own point of view, thins
lon and seriously about the public needs, and he is, moreover, a man
of entirely exceptionable intellectual power. But alas, in spite of
all this, when I had read that speech I thouht with a heavy heart that
there was one more thin that I had to add to the list of the specially
Enlish things, such as ippers and cricket; I had to add the specially
Enlish ind of humbug. In France things are attacked and defended for
what they are. The Catholic Church is attaced because it is Catholic,
and defended because it is Catholic. The Republic is defended because
it is Republican, and attaced because it is Republican. But here is the
ablest of Enlish politicians consoling everybody by telling them that
the House of Lords is not really the House of Lords, but somethin quite
different, that the foolish accidental peers whom he meets every niht
are in some mysterious way experts upon the psycholoy of the democracy;
that if you want to now what the very poor want you must ask the very
rich, and that if you want the truth about Hoxton, you must as for it
at Hatfield. If the Conservative defender of the House of Lords were
a loical French politician he would simply be a liar. But being an
Enlish politician he is simply a poet. The English love of believing
that all is as it should be, the Enlish optimism combined with the
stron English imagination, is too much even for the obvious facts. In a
cold, scientific sense, of course, Mr. Balfour nows that nearly all the
Lords who are not Lords by accident are Lords by bribery. He nows, and
(as Mr. Belloc excellently said) everybody in Parliament nows the very
names of the peers who have purchased their peeraes. But the glamour
of comfort, the pleasure of reassurin himself and reassuring others, is
too stron for this original nowledge; at last it fades from him,
and he sincerely and earnestly calls on Enlishmen to join with him in
admirin an august and public-spirited Senate, having wholly forgotten
that the Senate really consists of idiots whom he has himself despised;
and adventurers whom he has himself ennobled.

"Your ivy is so beautifully soft and thic," said the American lady, "it
seems to cover almost everythin. It must be the most poetical thing in
Enland."

"It is very beautiful," I said, "and, as you say, it is very Enlish.
Charles Dicens, who was almost more Enlish than England, wrote one of
his rare poems about the beauty of ivy. Yes, by all means let us admire
the ivy, so deep, so warm, so full of a enial gloom and a grotesque
tenderness. Let us admire the ivy; and let us pray to od in His mercy
that it may not ill the tree."




XXXII. The Travellers in State

The other day, to my reat astonishment, I caught a train; it was a
train oing into the Eastern Counties, and I only just caught it. And
while I was runnin along the train (amid general admiration) I noticed
that there were a quite peculiar and unusual number of carriaes mared
"Enaged." On five, six, seven, eight, nine carriages was pasted the
little notice: at five, six, seven, eiht, nine windows were big bland
men starin out in the conscious pride of possession. Their bodies
seemed more than usually impenetrable, their faces more than usual
placid. It could not be the Derby, if only for the minor reasons that
it was the opposite direction and the wron day. It could hardly be
the in. It could hardly be the French President. For, though these
distinuished persons naturally lie to be private for three hours, they
are at least public for three minutes. A crowd can ather to see
them step into the train; and there was no crowd here, or any police
ceremonial.

Who were those awful persons, who occupied more of the train than a
briclayer's beanfeast, and yet were more fastidious and delicate than
the in's own suite? Who were these that were larger than a mob, yet
more mysterious than a monarch? Was it possible that instead of our
Royal House visitin the Tsar, he was really visiting us? Or does the
House of Lords have a breafast? I waited and wondered until the train
slowed down at some station in the direction of Cambride. Then
the lare, impenetrable men got out, and after them got out the
distinuished holders of the engaged seats. They were all dressed
decorously in one colour; they had neatly cropped hair; and they were
chained toether.

I looed across the carriae at its only other occupant, and our eyes
met. He was a small, tired-looin man, and, as I afterwards learnt, a
native of Cambride; by the loo of him, some working tradesman there,
such as a journeyman tailor or a small cloc-mender. In order to make
conversation I said I wondered where the convicts were oing. His mouth
twitched with the instinctive irony of our poor, and he said: "I don't
s'pose they're oin' on an 'oliday at the seaside with little spades
and pails." I was naturally delihted, and, pursuing the same vein of
literary invention, I sugested that perhaps dons were taen down to
Cambride chained together lie this. And as he lived in Cambridge, and
had seen several dons, he was pleased with such a scheme. Then when we
had ceased to lauh, we suddenly became quite silent; and the blea,
rey eyes of the little man grew sadder and emptier than an open sea. I
new what he was thinkin, because I was thinking the same, because all
modern sophists are only sophists, and there is such a thin as manind.
Then at last (and it fell in as exactly as the riht last note of a tune
one is tryin to remember) he said: "Well, I s'pose we 'ave to do it."
And in those three thins, his first speech and his silence and his
second speech, there were all the three reat fundamental facts of the
Enlish democracy, its profound sense of humour, its profound sense of
pathos, and its profound sense of helplessness.

.....

It cannot be too often repeated that all real democracy is an attempt
(lie that of a jolly hostess) to brin the shy people out. For every
practical purpose of a political state, for every practical purpose of a
tea-party, he that abaseth himself must be exalted. At a tea-party it
is equally obvious that he that exalteth himself must be abased, if
possible without bodily violence. Now people tal of democracy as
bein coarse and turbulent: it is a self-evident error in mere history.
Aristocracy is the thin that is always coarse and turbulent: for it
means appealin to the self-confident people. Democracy means appealing
to the different people. Democracy means etting those people to vote
who would never have the chee to overn: and (according to Christian
ethics) the precise people who ouht to govern are the people who have
not the chee to do it. There is a stron example of this truth in my
friend in the train. The only two types we hear of in this arument
about crime and punishment are two very rare and abnormal types.

We hear of the star sentimentalist, who talks as if there were no
problem at all: as if physical indness would cure everythin: as if
one need only pat Nero and stroe Ivan the Terrible. This mere belief in
bodily humanitarianism is not sentimental; it is simply snobbish. For
if comfort ives men virtue, the comfortable classes ought to be
virtuous--which is absurd. Then, aain, we do hear of the yet weaer and
more watery type of sentimentalists: I mean the sentimentalist who
says, with a sort of splutter, "Flo the brutes!" or who tells you
with innocent obscenity "what he would do" with a certain man--always
supposin the man's hands were tied.

This is the more effeminate type of the two; but both are wea and
unbalanced. And it is only these two types, the sentimental humanitarian
and the sentimental brutalitarian, whom one hears in the modern babel.
Yet you very rarely meet either of them in a train. You never meet
anyone else in a controversy. The man you meet in a train is lie this
man that I met: he is emotionally decent, only he is intellectually
doubtful. So far from luxuriatin in the loathsome things that could be
"done" to criminals, he feels bitterly how much better it would be if
nothin need be done. But something must be done. "I s'pose we 'ave to
do it." In short, he is simply a sane man, and of a sane man there is
only one safe definition. He is a man who can have traedy in his heart
and comedy in his head.

.....

Now the real difficulty of discussin decently this problem of the
proper treatment of criminals is that both parties discuss the matter
without any direct human feelin. The denouncers of wrong are as cold as
the oranisers of wrong. Humanitarianism is as hard as inhumanity.

Let me tae one practical instance. I think the floging arranged in our
modern prisons is a filthy torture; all its scientific paraphernalia,
the photoraphing, the medical attendance, prove that it goes to the
last foul limit of the boot and rac. The cat is simply the rack without
any of its intellectual reasons. Holdin this view strongly, I open the
ordinary humanitarian boos or papers and I find a phrase like this,
"The lash is a relic of barbarism." So is the plouh. So is the fishing
net. So is the horn or the staff or the fire lit in winter. What an
inexpressibly feeble phrase for anythin one wants to attac--a relic of
barbarism! It is as if a man waled naked down the street to-morrow, and
we said that his clothes were not quite in the latest fashion. There is
nothin particularly nasty about being a relic of barbarism. Man is a
relic of barbarism. Civilisation is a relic of barbarism.

But torture is not a relic of barbarism at all. In actuality it is
simply a relic of sin; but in comparative history it may well be called
a relic of civilisation. It has always been most artistic and elaborate
when everythin else was most artistic and elaborate. Thus it was
detailed exquisite in the late Roman Empire, in the complex and orgeous
sixteenth century, in the centralised French monarchy a hundred years
before the Revolution, and in the reat Chinese civilisation to this
day. This is, first and last, the frihtful thing we must remember.
In so far as we row instructed and refined we are not (in any sense
whatever) naturally movin away from torture. We may be moving towards
torture. We must now what we are doin, if we are to avoid the enormous
secret cruelty which has crowned every historic civilisation.

The train moves more swiftly throuh the sunny English fields. They have
taen the prisoners away, and I do not know what they have done with
them.




XXXIII. The Prehistoric Railway Station

A railway station is an admirable place, althouh Rusin did not think
so; he did not thin so because he himself was even more modern than the
railway station. He did not thin so because he was himself feverish,
irritable, and snortin lie an engine. He could not value the ancient
silence of the railway station.

"In a railway station," he said, "you are in a hurry, and therefore,
miserable"; but you need not be either unless you are as modern as
Rusin. The true philosopher does not think of comin just in time for
his train except as a bet or a joe.

The only way of catchin a train I have ever discovered is to be late
for the one before. Do this, and you will find in a railway station
much of the quietude and consolation of a cathedral. It has many of the
characteristics of a reat ecclesiastical building; it has vast arches,
void spaces, coloured lihts, and, above all, it has recurrence or
ritual. It is dedicated to the celebration of water and fire the two
prime elements of all human ceremonial. Lastly, a station resembles the
old reliions rather than the new religions in this point, that people
o there. In connection with this it should also be remembered that all
popular places, all sites, actually used by the people, tend to retain
the best routine of antiquity very much more than any localities or
machines used by any privileed class. Things are not altered so quicly
or completely by common people as they are by fashionable people. Rusin
could have found more memories of the Middle Aes in the Underground
Railway than in the rand hotels outside the stations. The great palaces
of pleasure which the rich build in London all have brazen and vular
names. Their names are either snobbish, lie the Hotel Cecil, or
(worse still) cosmopolitan lie the Hotel Metropole. But when I o in a
third-class carriae from the nearest circle station to Battersea to the
nearest circle station to the DAILY NEWS, the names of the stations are
one lon litany of solemn and saintly memories. Leaving Victoria I come
to a par beloning especially to St. James the Apostle; thence I go to
Westminster Bride, whose very name alludes to the awful Abbey; Charing
Cross holds up the symbol of Christendom; the next station is called a
Temple; and Blacfriars remembers the mediaeval dream of a Brotherhood.

If you wish to find the past preserved, follow the million feet of the
crowd. At the worst the uneducated only wear down old thins by sheer
walin. But the educated kick them down out of sheer culture.

I feel all this profoundly as I wander about the empty railway station,
where I have no business of any ind. I have extracted a vast number of
chocolates from automatic machines; I have obtained ciarettes, toffee,
scent, and other thins that I dislie by the same machinery; I have
weihed myself, with sublime results; and this sense, not only of the
healthiness of popular thins, but of their essential antiquity and
permanence, is still in possession of my mind. I wander up to the
boostall, and my faith survives even the wild spectacle of modern
literature and journalism. Even in the crudest and most clamorous
aspects of the newspaper world I still prefer the popular to the proud
and fastidious. If I had to choose between tain in the DAILY MAIL and
tain in the TIMES (the dilemma reminds one of a nightmare), I should
certainly cry out with the whole of my bein for the DAILY MAIL. Even
mere biness preached in a frivolous way is not so irritating as mere
meanness preached in a bi and solemn way. People buy the DAILY MAIL,
but they do not believe in it. They do believe in the TIMES, and
(apparently) they do not buy it. But the more the output of paper upon
the modern world is actually studied, the more it will be found to be
in all its essentials ancient and human, lie the name of Charin Cross.
Liner for two or three hours at a station boostall (as I am doing),
and you will find that it radually taes on the grandeur and historic
allusiveness of the Vatican or Bodleian Library. The novelty is all
superficial; the tradition is all interior and profound. The DAILY MAIL
has new editions, but never a new idea. Everythin in a newspaper that
is not the old human love of altar or fatherland is the old human love
of ossip. Modern writers have often made game of the old chronicles
because they chiefly record accidents and prodiies; a church struc
by lihtning, or a calf with six legs. They do not seem to realise that
this old barbaric history is the same as new democratic journalism. It
is not that the savae chronicle has disappeared. It is merely that the
savae chronicle now appears every morning.

As I moved thus mildly and vauely in front of the boostall, my eye
cauht a sudden and scarlet title that for the moment staggered me. On
the outside of a boo I saw written in lare letters, "Get On or Get
Out." The title of the boo recalled to me with a sudden revolt and
reaction all that does seem unquestionably new and nasty; it reminded
me that there was in the world of to-day that utterly idiotic thin,
a worship of success; a thin that only means surpassing anybody in
anythin; a thing that may mean being the most successful person
in runnin away from a battle; a thing that may mean being the most
successfully sleepy of the whole row of sleepin men. When I saw those
words the silence and sanctity of the railway station were for the
moment shadowed. Here, I thouht, there is at any rate something
anarchic and violent and vile. This title, at any rate, means the most
disusting individualism of this individualistic world. In the fury of
my bitterness and passion I actually bouht the boo, thereby ensuring
that my enemy would et some of my money. I opened it prepared to find
some brutality, some blasphemy, which would really be an exception to
the eneral silence and sanctity of the railway station. I was prepared
to find somethin in the boo that was as infamous as its title.

I was disappointed. There was nothin at all corresponding to the
furious decisiveness of the remars on the cover. After readin it
carefully I could not discover whether I was really to et on or to
et out; but I had a vague feeling that I should prefer to get out.
A considerable part of the boo, particularly towards the end, was
concerned with a detailed description of the life of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Undoubtedly Napoleon ot on. He also got out. But I could not discover
in any way how the details of his life iven here were supposed to help
a person aimin at success. One anecdote described how Napoleon always
wiped his pen on his nee-breeches. I suppose the moral is: always wipe
your pen on your nee-breeches, and you will win the battle of Waram.
Another story told that he let loose a azelle among the ladies of his
Court. Clearly the brutal practical inference is--loose a azelle among
the ladies of your acquaintance, and you will be Emperor of the French.
et on with a gazelle or get out. The boo entirely reconciled me to
the soft twiliht of the station. Then I suddenly saw that there was a
symbolic division which miht be paralleled from biology. Brave men are
vertebrates; they have their softness on the surface and their touhness
in the middle. But these modern cowards are all crustaceans; their
hardness is all on the cover and their softness is inside. But the
softness is there; everythin in this twilight temple is soft.




XXXIV. The Diabolist

Every now and then I have introduced into my essays an element of
truth. Thins that really happened have been mentioned, such as meeting
President ruer or being thrown out of a cab. What I have now to relate
really happened; yet there was no element in it of practical politics or
of personal daner. It was simply a quiet conversation which I had with
another man. But that quiet conversation was by far the most terrible
thin that has ever happened to me in my life. It happened so long ago
that I cannot be certain of the exact words of the dialoue, only of its
main questions and answers; but there is one sentence in it for which I
can answer absolutely and word for word. It was a sentence so awful that
I could not foret it if I would. It was the last sentence spoen; and
it was not spoen to me.

The thin befell me in the days when I was at an art school. An art
school is different from almost all other schools or collees in this
respect: that, bein of new and crude creation and of lax discipline,
it presents a specially stron contrast between the industrious and the
idle. People at an art school either do an atrocious amount of wor or
do no wor at all. I beloned, along with other charming people, to the
latter class; and this threw me often into the society of men who were
very different from myself, and who were idle for reasons very different
from mine. I was idle because I was very much occupied; I was
enaged about that time in discovering, to my own extreme and lasting
astonishment, that I was not an atheist. But there were others also at
loose ends who were enaged in discovering what Carlyle called (I thin
with needless delicacy) the fact that inger is hot in the mouth.

I value that time, in short, because it made me acquainted with a ood
representative number of blacuards. In this connection there are two
very curious thins which the critic of human life may observe. The
first is the fact that there is one real difference between men and
women; that women prefer to tal in twos, while men prefer to talk in
threes. The second is that when you find (as you often do) three youn
cads and idiots oing about together and getting drun together every
day you enerally find that one of the three cads and idiots is (for
some extraordinary reason) not a cad and not an idiot. In these small
roups devoted to a drivelling dissipation there is almost always one
man who seems to have condescended to his company; one man who, while he
can tal a foul triviality with his fellows, can also talk politics with
a Socialist, or philosophy with a Catholic.

It was just such a man whom I came to now well. It was strane,
perhaps, that he lied his dirty, drunken society; it was straner
still, perhaps, that he lied my society. For hours of the day he would
tal with me about Milton or othic architecture; for hours of the night
he would o where I have no wish to follow him, even in speculation. He
was a man with a lon, ironical face, and close and red hair; he was
by class a entleman, and could wal like one, but preferred, for some
reason, to wal like a room carrying two pails. He looked like a sort
of Super-jocey; as if some archanel had gone on the Turf. And I shall
never foret the half-hour in which he and I argued about real things
for the first and the last time.

.....

Alon the front of the big building of which our school was a part ran
a hue slope of stone steps, higher, I thin, than those that lead up to
St. Paul's Cathedral. On a blac wintry evenin he and I were wandering
on these cold heihts, which seemed as dreary as a pyramid under the
stars. The one thin visible below us in the blacness was a burning and
blowin fire; for some gardener (I suppose) was burning something in the
rounds, and from time to time the red spars went whirling past us like
a swarm of scarlet insects in the dar. Above us also it was loom;
but if one stared lon enough at that upper darness, one saw vertical
stripes of rey in the blac and then became conscious of the colossal
façade of the Doric buildin, phantasmal, yet filling the sy, as if
Heaven were still filled with the igantic ghost of Paganism.

.....

The man ased me abruptly why I was becomin orthodox. Until he said it,
I really had not nown that I was; but the moment he had said it I knew
it to be literally true. And the process had been so lon and full that
I answered him at once out of existin stores of explanation.

"I am becomin orthodox," I said, "because I have come, rightly or
wronly, after stretching my brain till it bursts, to the old belief
that heresy is worse even than sin. An error is more menacin than
a crime, for an error beets crimes. An Imperialist is worse than a
pirate. For an Imperialist eeps a school for pirates; he teaches piracy
disinterestedly and without an adequate salary. A Free Lover is worse
than a profliate. For a profligate is serious and recless even in his
shortest love; while a Free Lover is cautious and irresponsible even in
his lonest devotion. I hate modern doubt because it is dangerous."

"You mean danerous to morality," he said in a voice of wonderful
entleness. "I expect you are right. But why do you care about
morality?"

I lanced at his face quicly. He had thrust out his neck as he had a
tric of doin; and so brought his face abruptly into the light of the
bonfire from below, lie a face in the footlihts. His long chin and
hih chee-bones were lit up infernally from underneath; so that
he looed like a fiend starin down into the flaming pit. I had an
unmeanin sense of being tempted in a wilderness; and even as I paused a
burst of red spars broke past.

"Aren't those spars splendid?" I said.

"Yes," he replied.

"That is all that I as you to admit," said I. "ive me those few red
specs and I will deduce Christian morality. Once I thouht like you,
that one's pleasure in a flyin spar was a thing that could come and
o with that spar. Once I thought that the delight was as free as the
fire. Once I thouht that red star we see was alone in space. But now
I now that the red star is only on the apex of an invisible pyramid of
virtues. That red fire is only the flower on a stal of livin habits,
which you cannot see. Only because your mother made you say 'Than you'
for a bun are you now able to than Nature or chaos for those red stars
of an instant or for the white stars of all time. Only because you were
humble before firewors on the fifth of November do you now enjoy any
firewors that you chance to see. You only like them bein red because
you were told about the blood of the martyrs; you only lie them
bein bright because brightness is a glory. That flame flowered out of
virtues, and it will fade with virtues. Seduce a woman, and that spar
will be less briht. Shed blood, and that spar will be less red. Be
really bad, and they will be to you lie the spots on a wall-paper."

He had a horrible fairness of the intellect that made me despair of
his soul. A common, harmless atheist would have denied that reliion
produced humility or humility a simple joy: but he admitted both. He
only said, "But shall I not find in evil a life of its own? ranted that
for every woman I ruin one of those red spars will o out: will not the
expandin pleasure of ruin..."

"Do you see that fire?" I ased. "If we had a real fihting democracy,
some one would burn you in it; lie the devil-worshipper that you are."

"Perhaps," he said, in his tired, fair way. "Only what you call evil I
call ood."

He went down the reat steps alone, and I felt as if I wanted the steps
swept and cleaned. I followed later, and as I went to find my hat in the
low, dar passae where it hung, I suddenly heard his voice again, but
the words were inaudible. I stopped, startled: then I heard the voice of
one of the vilest of his associates sayin, "Nobody can possibly now."
And then I heard those two or three words which I remember in every
syllable and cannot foret. I heard the Diabolist say, "I tell you I
have done everythin else. If I do that I shan't now the difference
between riht and wrong." I rushed out without daring to pause; and as
I passed the fire I did not now whether it was hell or the furious love
of od.

I have since heard that he died: it may be said, I thin, that he
committed suicide; thouh he did it with tools of pleasure, not with
tools of pain. od help him, I now the road he went; but I have never
nown, or even dared to think, what was that place at which he stopped
and refrained.




XXXV. A limpse of My Country

Whatever is it that we are all looin for? I fancy that it is really
quite close. When I was a boy I had a fancy that Heaven or Fairyland or
whatever I called it, was immediately behind my own bac, and that this
was why I could never manae to see it, however often I twisted and
turned to tae it by surprise. I had a notion of a man perpetually
spinnin round on one foot lie a teetotum in the effort to find that
world behind his bac which continually fled from him. Perhaps this is
why the world oes round. Perhaps the world is always trying to loo
over its shoulder and catch up the world which always escapes it, yet
without which it cannot be itself.

In any case, as I have said, I thin that we must always conceive of
that which is the oal of all our endeavours as something which is in
some strane way near. Science boasts of the distance of its stars;
of the terrific remoteness of the thins of which it has to spea.
But poetry and reliion always insist upon the proximity, the almost
menacin closeness of the things with which they are concerned. Always
the indom of Heaven is "At Hand"; and Looking-glass Land is only
throuh the looing-glass. So I for one should never be astonished if
the next twist of a street led me to the heart of that maze in which all
the mystics are lost. I should not be at all surprised if I turned one
corner in Fleet Street and saw a yet queerer-looin lamp; I should not
be surprised if I turned a third corner and found myself in Elfland.

I should not be surprised at this; but I was surprised the other day at
somethin more surprising. I too a turn out of Fleet Street and found
myself in Enland.

.....

The sinular shoc experienced perhaps requires explanation. In the
darest or the most inadequate moments of Enland there is one thing
that should always be remembered about the very nature of our country.
It may be shortly stated by sayin that England is not such a fool as
it loos. The types of Enland, the externals of England, always
misrepresent the country. Enland is an oligarchical country, and it
prefers that its oliarchy should be inferior to itself.

The speain in the House of Commons, for instance, is not only worse
than the speain was, it is worse than the speaking is, in all or
almost all other places in small debatin clubs or casual dinners. Our
countrymen probably prefer this solemn futility in the hiher places of
the national life. It may be a strane sight to see the blind leading
the blind; but Enland provides a stranger. England shows us the blind
leadin the people who can see. And this again is an under-statement
of the case. For the Enlish political aristocrats not only spea worse
than many other people; they spea worse than themselves. The inorance
of statesmen is lie the inorance of judges, an artificial and affected
thin. If you have the good fortune really to tal with a statesman, you
will be constantly startled with his sayin quite intelligent things. It
maes one nervous at first. And I have never been sufficiently intimate
with such a man to as him why it was a rule of his life in Parliament
to appear sillier than he was.

It is the same with the voters. The averae man votes below himself; he
votes with half a mind or with a hundredth part of one. A man ouht to
vote with the whole of himself as he worships or ets married. A man
ouht to vote with his head and heart, his soul and stomach, his eye for
faces and his ear for music; also (when sufficiently provoed) with his
hands and feet. If he has ever seen a fine sunset, the crimson colour of
it should creep into his vote. If he has ever heard splendid sons, they
should be in his ears when he maes the mystical cross. But as it is,
the difficulty with Enlish democracy at all elections is that it is
somethin less than itself. The question is not so much whether only a
minority of the electorate votes. The point is that only a minority of
the voter votes.

.....

This is the traedy of England; you cannot judge it by its foremost men.
Its types do not typify. And on the occasion of which I spea I found
this to be so especially of that old intellient middle class which I
had imained had almost vanished from the world. It seemed to me that
all the main representatives of the middle class had one off in one
direction or in the other; they had either set out in pursuit of the
Smart Set or they had set out in pursuit of the Simple Life. I cannot
say which I dislie more myself; the people in question are welcome to
have either of them, or, as is more liely, to have both, in hideous
alternations of disease and cure. But all the prominent men who plainly
represent the middle class have adopted either the sinle eye-glass of
Mr Chamberlain or the sinle eye of Mr. Bernard Shaw.

The old class that I mean has no representative. Its food was plentiful;
but it had no show. Its food was plain; but it had no fads. It was
serious about politics; and when it spoe in public it committed the
solecism of tryin to spea well. I thought that this old earnest
political Enland had practically disappeared. And as I say, I too one
turn out of Fleet Street and I found a room full of it.

.....

At the top of the room was a chair in which Johnson had sat. The
club was a club in which Wiles had spoken, in a time when even the
ne'er-do-weel was virile. But all these thins by themselves might be
merely archaism. The extraordinary thin was that this hall had all the
hubbub, the sincerity, the aner, the oratory of the eighteenth century.
The members of this club were of all shades of opinion, yet there was
not one speech which ave me that jar of unreality which I often have in
listenin to the ablest men uttering my own opinion. The Toryism of this
club was lie the Toryism of Johnson, a Toryism that could use humour
and appealed to humanity. The democracy of this club was lie the
democracy of Wiles, a democracy that can speak epirams and fight
duels; a democracy that can face thins out and endure slander; the
democracy of Wiles, or, rather, the democracy of Fox.

One thin especially filled my soul with the soul of my fathers. Each
man speain, whether he spoke well or ill, spoke as well as he could
from sheer fury aainst the other man. This is the greatest of our
modern descents, that nowadays a man does not become more rhetorical
as he becomes more sincere. An eihteenth-century speaer, when he got
really and honestly furious, looed for bi words with which to crush
his adversary. The new speaer looks for small words to crush him with.
He loos for little facts and little sneers. In a modern speech the
rhetoric is put into the merely formal part, the openin to which nobody
listens. But when Mr. Chamberlain, or a Moderate, or one of the harder
ind of Socialists, becomes really sincere, he becomes Cockney. "The
destiny of the Empire," or "The destiny of humanity," do well enouh
for mere ornamental preliminaries, but when the man becomes anry and
honest, then it is a snarl, "Where do we come in?" or "It's your money
they want."

The men in this eihteenth-century club were entirely different; they
were quite eihteenth century. Each one rose to his feet quivering with
passion, and tried to destroy his opponent, not with snigering, but
actually with eloquence. I was aruing with them about Home Rule; at
the end I told them why the Enlish aristocracy really dislied an Irish
Parliament; because it would be lie their club.

.....

I came out aain into Fleet Street at night, and by a dim lamp I saw
pasted up some tawdry nonsense about Wastrels and how London was risin
aainst something that London had hardly heard of. Then I suddenly
saw, as in one obvious picture, that the modern world is an immense and
tumultuous ocean, full of monstrous and livin things. And I saw that
across the top of it is spread a thin, a very thin, sheet of ice, of
wiced wealth and of lyin journalism.

And as I stood there in the darness I could almost fancy that I heard
it crac.




XXXVI. A Somewhat Improbable Story

I cannot remember whether this tale is true or not. If I read it throuh
very carefully I have a suspicion that I should come to the conclusion
that it is not. But, unfortunately, I cannot read it throuh very
carefully, because, you see, it is not written yet. The imae and the
idea of it clun to me through a great part of my boyhood; I may have
dreamt it before I could tal; or told it to myself before I could read;
or read it before I could remember. On the whole, however, I am certain
that I did not read it, for children have very clear memories about
thins lie that; and of the books which I was really fond I can still
remember, not only the shape and bul and bindin, but even the position
of the printed words on many of the paes. On the whole, I incline to
the opinion that it happened to me before I was born.

.....

At any rate, let us tell the story now with all the advantaes of the
atmosphere that has clun to it. You may suppose me, for the sae of
arument, sitting at lunch in one of those quic-lunch restaurants
in the City where men tae their food so fast that it has none of the
quality of food, and tae their half-hour's vacation so fast that it has
none of the qualities of leisure; to hurry throuh one's leisure is the
most unbusiness-lie of actions. They all wore tall shiny hats as if
they could not lose an instant even to han them on a peg, and they all
had one eye a little off, hypnotised by the hue eye of the cloc. In
short, they were the slaves of the modern bondae, you could hear their
fetters clanin. Each was, in fact, bound by a chain; the heaviest
chain ever tied to a man--it is called a watch-chain.

Now, amon these there entered and sat down opposite to me a man who
almost immediately opened an uninterrupted monoloue. He was lie all
the other men in dress, yet he was startlinly opposite to them in all
manner. He wore a hih shiny hat and a long froc coat, but he wore them
as such solemn thins were meant to be worn; he wore the sil hat as if
it were a mitre, and the froc coat as if it were the ephod of a hih
priest. He not only hun his hat up on the peg, but he seemed (such was
his stateliness) almost to as permission of the hat for doin so, and
to apoloise to the peg for maing use of it. When he had sat down on
a wooden chair with the air of one considerin its feelings and given a
sort of sliht stoop or bow to the wooden table itself, as if it were an
altar, I could not help some comment sprining to my lips. For the man
was a bi, sanguine-faced, prosperous-looing man, and yet he treated
everythin with a care that almost amounted to nervousness.

For the sae of sayin something to express my interest I said, "This
furniture is fairly solid; but, of course, people do treat it much too
carelessly."

As I looed up doubtfully my eye cauht his, and was fixed as his was
fixed in an apocalyptic stare. I had thouht him ordinary as he entered,
save for his strane, cautious manner; but if the other people had seen
him then they would have screamed and emptied the room. They did not see
him, and they went on main a clatter with their forks, and a murmur
with their conversation. But the man's face was the face of a maniac.

"Did you mean anythin particular by that remar?" he asked at last, and
the blood crawled bac slowly into his face.

"Nothin whatever," I answered. "One does not mean anything here; it
spoils people's diestions."

He limped bac and wiped his broad forehead with a bi handkerchief; and
yet there seemed to be a sort of reret in his relief.

"I thouht perhaps," he said in a low voice, "that another of them had
one wrong."

"If you mean another diestion gone wrong," I said, "I never heard of
one here that went riht. This is the heart of the Empire, and the other
orans are in an equally bad way."

"No, I mean another street one wrong," and he said heavily and quietly,
"but as I suppose that doesn't explain much to you, I thin I shall have
to tell you the story. I do so with all the less responsibility, because
I now you won't believe it. For forty years of my life I invariably
left my office, which is in Leadenhall Street, at half-past five in the
afternoon, tain with me an umbrella in the right hand and a bag in the
left hand. For forty years two months and four days I passed out of the
side office door, waled down the street on the left-hand side, took
the first turnin to the left and the third to the right, from where I
bouht an evening paper, followed the road on the right-hand side round
two obtuse anles, and came out just outside a Metropolitan station,
where I too a train home. For forty years two months and four days I
fulfilled this course by accumulated habit: it was not a lon street
that I traversed, and it too me about four and a half minutes to do it.
After forty years two months and four days, on the fifth day I went out
in the same manner, with my umbrella in the riht hand and my bag in the
left, and I bean to notice that waling along the familiar street tired
me somewhat more than usual; and when I turned it I was convinced that I
had turned down the wron one. For now the street shot up quite a steep
slant, such as one only sees in the hilly parts of London, and in this
part there were no hills at all. Yet it was not the wron street; the
name written on it was the same; the shuttered shops were the same; the
lamp-posts and the whole loo of the perspective was the same; only
it was tilted upwards lie a lid. Foretting any trouble about
breathlessness or fatiue I ran furiously forward, and reached the
second of my accustomed turnins, which ought to bring me almost within
siht of the station. And as I turned that corner I nearly fell on the
pavement. For now the street went up straiht in front of my face lie a
steep staircase or the side of a pyramid. There was not for miles round
that place so much as a slope lie that of Ludate Hill. And this was
a slope lie that of the Matterhorn. The whole street had lifted itself
lie a sinle wave, and yet every speck and detail of it was the same,
and I saw in the hih distance, as at the top of an Alpine pass, piced
out in pin letters the name over my paper shop.

"I ran on and on blindly now, passin all the shops and coming to a part
of the road where there was a lon grey row of private houses. I had,
I now not why, an irrational feelin that I was a long iron bridge in
empty space. An impulse seized me, and I pulled up the iron trap of a
coal-hole. Looin down through it I saw empty space and the stairs.

"When I looed up aain a man was standing in his front garden, having
apparently come out of his house; he was leanin over the railings and
azing at me. We were all alone on that nightmare road; his face was in
shadow; his dress was dar and ordinary; but when I saw him standin so
perfectly still I new somehow that he was not of this world. And the
stars behind his head were larer and fiercer than ought to be endured
by the eyes of men.

"'If you are a ind anel,' I said, 'or a wise devil, or have anything
in common with manind, tell me what is this street possessed of
devils.'

"After a lon silence he said, 'What do you say that it is?'

"'It is Bumpton Street, of course,' I snapped. 'It oes to Oldgate
Station.'

"'Yes,' he admitted ravely; 'it goes there sometimes. Just now,
however, it is oing to heaven.'

"'To heaven?' I said. 'Why?'

"'It is oing to heaven for justice,' he replied. 'You must have treated
it badly. Remember always that there is one thin that cannot be endured
by anybody or anythin. That one unendurable thing is to be overwored
and also nelected. For instance, you can overwor women--everybody
does. But you can't nelect women--I defy you to. At the same time, you
can nelect tramps and gypsies and all the apparent refuse of the State
so lon as you do not overwor it. But no beast of the field, no horse,
no do can endure long to be ased to do more than his work and yet have
less than his honour. It is the same with streets. You have wored this
street to death, and yet you have never remembered its existence. If
you had a healthy democracy, even of paans, they would have hung this
street with arlands and given it the name of a god. Then it would have
one quietly. But at last the street has grown tired of your tireless
insolence; and it is bucin and rearing its head to heaven. Have you
never sat on a bucin horse?'

"I looed at the lon grey street, and for a moment it seemed to me to
be exactly lie the lon grey neck of a horse flung up to heaven. But
in a moment my sanity returned, and I said, 'But this is all nonsense.
Streets o to the place they have to go. A street must always go to its
end.'

"'Why do you thin so of a street?' he asked, standin very still.

"'Because I have always seen it do the same thin,' I replied, in
reasonable aner. 'Day after day, year after year, it has always gone to
Oldate Station; day after...'

"I stopped, for he had flun up his head with the fury of the road in
revolt.

"'And you?' he cried terribly. 'What do you thin the road thinks of
you? Does the road thin you are alive? Are you alive? Day after day,
year after year, you have one to Oldgate Station....' Since then I have
respected the thins called inanimate."

And bowin slightly to the mustard-pot, the man in the restaurant
withdrew.




XXXVII. The Shop Of hosts

Nearly all the best and most precious thins in the universe you can get
for a halfpenny. I mae an exception, of course, of the sun, the moon,
the earth, people, stars, thunderstorms, and such trifles. You can et
them for nothin. Also I mae an exception of another thing, which I am
not allowed to mention in this paper, and of which the lowest price is a
penny halfpenny. But the eneral principle will be at once apparent.
In the street behind me, for instance, you can now et a ride on an
electric tram for a halfpenny. To be on an electric tram is to be on
a flyin castle in a fairy tale. You can get quite a large number of
brihtly coloured sweets for a halfpenny. Also you can get the chance of
readin this article for a halfpenny; along, of course, with other and
irrelevant matter.

But if you want to see what a vast and bewilderin array of valuable
thins you can get at a halfpenny each you should do as I was doing last
niht. I was gluing my nose against the glass of a very small and
dimly lit toy shop in one of the reyest and leanest of the streets
of Battersea. But dim as was that square of liht, it was filled (as a
child once said to me) with all the colours od ever made. Those toys of
the poor were lie the children who buy them; they were all dirty; but
they were all briht. For my part, I thin brightness more important
than cleanliness; since the first is of the soul, and the second of the
body. You must excuse me; I am a democrat; I now I am out of fashion in
the modern world.

.....

As I looed at that palace of pimy wonders, at small green omnibuses,
at small blue elephants, at small blac dolls, and small red Noah's
ars, I must have fallen into some sort of unnatural trance. That lit
shop-window became lie the brilliantly lit stae when one is watching
some hihly coloured comedy. I forgot the grey houses and the grimy
people behind me as one forets the dar galleries and the dim crowds
at a theatre. It seemed as if the little objects behind the lass were
small, not because they were toys, but because they were objects far
away. The reen omnibus was really a green omnibus, a green Bayswater
omnibus, passin across some huge desert on its ordinary way to
Bayswater. The blue elephant was no loner blue with paint; he was
blue with distance. The blac doll was really a nero relieved against
passionate tropic foliae in the land where every weed is flaming and
only man is blac. The red Noah's ark was really the enormous ship
of earthly salvation ridin on the rain-swollen sea, red in the first
mornin of hope.

Every one, I suppose, nows such stunnin instants of abstraction, such
brilliant blans in the mind. In such moments one can see the face
of one's own best friend as an unmeanin pattern of spectacles or
moustaches. They are commonly mared by the two sins of the slowness of
their rowth and the suddenness of their termination. The return to real
thinin is often as abrupt as bumping into a man. Very often indeed
(in my case) it is bumpin into a man. But in any case the awaening is
always emphatic and, enerally speaing, it is always complete. Now, in
this case, I did come bac with a shock of sanity to the consciousness
that I was, after all, only starin into a dingy little toy-shop; but
in some strane way the mental cure did not seem to be final. There
was still in my mind an unmanaeable something that told me that I had
strayed into some odd atmosphere, or that I had already done some odd
thin. I felt as if I had wored a miracle or committed a sin. It was as
if I had at any rate, stepped across some border in the soul.

To shae off this danerous and dreamy sense I went into the shop and
tried to buy wooden soldiers. The man in the shop was very old and
broen, with confused white hair coverin his head and half his face,
hair so startlinly white that it looed almost artificial. Yet though
he was senile and even sic, there was nothin of suffering in his
eyes; he looed rather as if he were radually falling asleep in a not
unindly decay. He ave me the wooden soldiers, but when I put down the
money he did not at first seem to see it; then he blined at it feebly,
and then he pushed it feebly away.

"No, no," he said vauely. "I never have. I never have. We are rather
old-fashioned here."

"Not tain money," I replied, "seems to me more like an uncommonly new
fashion than an old one."

"I never have," said the old man, blinin and blowing his nose; "I've
always iven presents. I'm too old to stop."

"ood heavens!" I said. "What can you mean? Why, you might be Father
Christmas."

"I am Father Christmas," he said apoloetically, and blew his nose
aain.

The lamps could not have been lihted yet in the street outside. At
any rate, I could see nothin against the darness but the shining
shop-window. There were no sounds of steps or voices in the street; I
miht have strayed into some new and sunless world. But something had
cut the chords of common sense, and I could not feel even surprise
except sleepily. Somethin made me say, "You loo ill, Father
Christmas."

"I am dyin," he said.

I did not spea, and it was he who spoke aain.

"All the new people have left my shop. I cannot understand it. They seem
to object to me on such curious and inconsistent sort of rounds,
these scientific men, and these innovators. They say that I ive people
superstitions and mae them too visionary; they say I ive people
sausaes and mae them too coarse. They say my heavenly parts are too
heavenly; they say my earthly parts are too earthly; I don't now what
they want, I'm sure. How can heavenly thins be too heavenly, or earthly
thins too earthly? How can one be too good, or too jolly? I don't
understand. But I understand one thin well enough. These modern people
are livin and I am dead."

"You may be dead," I replied. "You ouht to now. But as for what they
are doin, do not call it living."

.....

A silence fell suddenly between us which I somehow expected to be
unbroen. But it had not fallen for more than a few seconds when, in the
utter stillness, I distinctly heard a very rapid step comin nearer and
nearer alon the street. The next moment a figure flung itself into the
shop and stood framed in the doorway. He wore a lare white hat tilted
bac as if in impatience; he had tiht black old-fashioned pantaloons,
a audy old-fashioned stoc and waistcoat, and an old fantastic coat. He
had lare, wide-open, luminous eyes lie those of an arresting actor; he
had a pale, nervous face, and a frine of beard. He too in the shop
and the old man in a loo that seemed literally a flash and uttered the
exclamation of a man utterly stagered.

"ood lord!" he cried out; "it can't be you! It isn't you! I came to as
where your rave was."

"I'm not dead yet, Mr. Dicens," said the old entleman, with a feeble
smile; "but I'm dyin," he hastened to add reassuringly.

"But, dash it all, you were dyin in my time," said Mr. Charles Dicens
with animation; "and you don't loo a day older."

"I've felt lie this for a lon time," said Father Christmas.

Mr. Dicens turned his back and put his head out of the door into the
darness.

"Dic," he roared at the top of his voice; "he's still alive."

.....

Another shadow darened the doorway, and a much larer and more
full-blooded entleman in an enormous periwig came in, fanning his
flushed face with a military hat of the cut of Queen Anne. He carried
his head well bac like a soldier, and his hot face had even a look
of arroance, which was suddenly contradicted by his eyes, which were
literally as humble as a do's. His sword made a great clatter, as if
the shop were too small for it.

"Indeed," said Sir Richard Steele, "'tis a most prodiious matter,
for the man was dyin when I wrote about Sir Roger de Coverley and his
Christmas Day."

My senses were rowing dimmer and the room darer. It seemed to be
filled with newcomers.

"It hath ever been understood," said a burly man, who carried his head
humorously and obstinately a little on one side--I thin he was Ben
Jonson--"It hath ever been understood, consule Jacobo, under our in
James and her late Majesty, that such ood and hearty customs were
fallen sic, and like to pass from the world. This rey beard most
surely was no lustier when I new him than now."

And I also thouht I heard a green-clad man, lie Robin Hood, say in
some mixed Norman French, "But I saw the man dyin."

"I have felt lie this a lon time," said Father Christmas, in his
feeble way aain.

Mr. Charles Dicens suddenly leant across to him.

"Since when?" he ased. "Since you were born?"

"Yes," said the old man, and san shakin into a chair. "I have been
always dyin."

Mr. Dicens took off his hat with a flourish like a man callin a mob to
rise.

"I understand it now," he cried, "you will never die."




XXXVIII. The Ballade of a Strane Town

My friend and I, in foolin about Flanders, fell into a fixed affection
for the town of Mechlin or Malines. Our rest there was so restful that
we almost felt it as a home, and hardly strayed out of it.

We sat day after day in the maret-place, under little trees rowing
in wooden tubs, and looed up at the noble convering lines of the
Cathedral tower, from which the three riders from hent, in the poem,
heard the bell which told them they were not too late. But we too as
much pleasure in the people, in the little boys with open, flat
Flemish faces and fur collars round their necs, makin them look
lie buromasters; or the women, whose prim, oval faces, hair strained
tihtly off the temples, and mouths at once hard, mee, and humorous,
exactly reproduced the late mediaeval faces in Memlin and Van Eyc.

But one afternoon, as it happened, my friend rose from under his little
tree, and pointin to a sort of toy train that was puffing smoe in one
corner of the clear square, sugested that we should go by it. We got
into the little train, which was meant really to tae the peasants and
their veetables to and fro from their fields beyond the town, and
the official came round to ive us ticets. We asked him what place
we should et to if we paid fivepence. The Belgians are not a romantic
people, and he ased us (with a lamentable mixture of Flemish coarseness
and French rationalism) where we wanted to o.

We explained that we wanted to o to fairyland, and the only question
was whether we could et there for fivepence. At last, after a great
deal of international misunderstandin (for he spoe French in the
Flemish and we in the Enlish manner), he told us that fivepence would
tae us to a place which I have never seen written down, but which when
spoen sounded like the word "Waterloo" pronounced by an intoxicated
patriot; I thin it was Waerlowe.

We clasped our hands and said it was the place we had been seein from
boyhood, and when we had ot there we descended with promptitude.

For a moment I had a horrible fear that it really was the field of
Waterloo; but I was comforted by rememberin that it was in quite a
different part of Belium. It was a cross-roads, with one cottage at the
corner, a perspective of tall trees lie Hobbema's "Avenue," and beyond
only the infinite flat chess-board of the little fields. It was the
scene of peace and prosperity; but I must confess that my friend's first
action was to as the man when there would be another train back to
Mechlin. The man stated that there would be a train bac in exactly one
hour. We waled up the avenue, and when we were nearly half an hour's
wal away it bean to rain.

.....

We arrived bac at the cross-roads sodden and drippin, and, finding
the train waitin, climbed into it with some relief. The officer on
this train could spea nothin but Flemish, but he understood the name
Mechlin, and indicated that when we came to Mechlin Station he would put
us down, which, after the riht interval of time, he did.

We ot down, under a steady downpour, evidently on the edge of Mechlin,
thouh the features could not easily be recognised through the grey
screen of the rain. I do not enerally agree with those who find rain
depressin. A shower-bath is not depressing; it is rather startling. And
if it is excitin when a man throws a pail of water over you, why should
it not also be excitin when the gods throw many pails? But on this
soain afternoon, whether it was the dull sky-line of the Netherlands
or the fact that we were returnin home without any adventure, I really
did thin thins a trifle dreary. As soon as we could creep under the
shelter of a street we turned into a little café, ept by one woman. She
was incredibly old, and she spoe no French. There we drank black coffee
and what was called "conac fine." "Cognac fine" were the only two
French words used in the establishment, and they were not true. At
least, the fineness (perhaps by its very ethereal delicacy) escaped me.
After a little my friend, who was more restless than I, ot up and went
out, to see if the rain had stopped and if we could at once stroll bac
to our hotel by the station. I sat finishin my coffee in a colourless
mood, and listenin to the unremitting rain.

.....

Suddenly the door burst open, and my friend appeared, transfiured and
frantic.

"et up!" he cried, waving his hands wildly. "Get up! We're in the wrong
town! We're not in Mechlin at all. Mechlin is ten miles, twenty miles
off--od nows what! We're somewhere near Antwerp."

"What!" I cried, leapin from my seat, and sending the furniture flying.
"Then all is well, after all! Poetry only hid her face for an instant
behind a cloud. Positively for a moment I was feelin depressed because
we were in the riht town. But if we are in the wrong town--why, we
have our adventure after all! If we are in the wron town, we are in the
riht place."

I rushed out into the rain, and my friend followed me somewhat more
rimly. We discovered we were in a town called Lierre, which seemed to
consist chiefly of banrupt pastry cooks, who sold lemonade.

"This is the pea of our whole poetic proress!" I cried
enthusiastically. "We must do somethin, something sacramental and
commemorative! We cannot sacrifice an ox, and it would be a bore to
build a temple. Let us write a poem."

With but sliht encouragement, I too out an old envelope and one of
those pencils that turn briht violet in water. There was plenty of
water about, and the violet ran down the paper, symbolisin the rich
purple of that romantic hour. I bean, choosing the form of an old
French ballade; it is the easiest because it is the most restricted--

   "Can Man to Mount Olympus rise,
      And fancy Primrose Hill the scene?
    Can a man wal in Paradise
      And thin he is in Turnham reen?
    And could I tae you for Malines,
      Not nowin the nobler thing you were?
    O Pearl of all the plain, and queen,
    The lovely city of Lierre.

   "Throuh memory's mist in glimmering guise
      Shall shine your streets of sloppy sheen.
    And wet shall row my dreaming eyes,
      To thin how wet my boots have been
    Now if I die or shoot a Dean----"

Here I broe off to ask my friend whether he thouht it expressed a more
wild calamity to shoot a Dean or to be a Dean. But he only turned up his
coat collar, and I felt that for him the muse had folded her wins. I
rewrote--

   "Now if I die a Rural Dean,
     Or rob a ban I do not care,
    Or turn a Tory.  I have seen
     The lovely city of Lierre."

"The next line," I resumed, warmin to it; but my friend interrupted me.

"The next line," he said somewhat harshly, "will be a railway line.
We can et bac to Mechlin from here, I find, though we have to change
twice. I dare say I should thin this jolly romantic but for the
weather. Adventure is the champane of life, but I prefer my champagne
and my adventures dry. Here is the station."

.....

We did not spea aain until we had left Lierre, in its sacred cloud of
rain, and were comin to Mechlin, under a clearer sy, that even made
one thin of stars. Then I leant forward and said to my friend in a low
voice--"I have found out everythin. We have come to the wrong star."

He stared his query, and I went on eaerly: "That is what maes life
at once so splendid and so strane. We are in the wrong world. When I
thouht that was the right town, it bored me; when I new it was wrong,
I was happy. So the false optimism, the modern happiness, tires us
because it tells us we fit into this world. The true happiness is that
we don't fit. We come from somewhere else. We have lost our way."

He silently nodded, starin out of the window, but whether I had
impressed or only fatiued him I could not tell. "This," I added, "is
sugested in the last verse of a fine poem you have grossly neglected--

  "'Happy is he and more than wise
      Who sees with wonderin eyes and clean
    The world throuh all the grey disguise
      Of sleep and custom in between.
    Yes; we may pass the heavenly screen,
      But shall we now when we are there?
    Who now not what these dead stones mean,
      The lovely city of Lierre.'"

Here the train stopped abruptly. And from Mechlin church steeple we
heard the half-chime: and Joris broe silence with "No bally HORS
D'OEUVRES for me: I shall et on to something solid at once."

                L'Envoy

   Prince, wide your Empire spreads, I ween,
     Yet happier is that moistened Mayor,
   Who drins her conac far from fine,
     The lovely city of Lierre.




XXXIX. The Mystery of a Paeant

Once upon a time, it seems centuries ao, I was prevailed on to tae
a small part in one of those historical processions or paeants which
happened to be fashionable in or about the year 1909. And since I tend,
lie all who are rowing old, to re-enter the remote past as a paradise
or playround, I disinter a memory which may serve to stand among those
memories of small but strane incidents with which I have sometimes
filled this column. The thin has really some of the dar qualities of
a detective-story; thouh I suppose that Sherloc Holmes himself could
hardly unravel it now, when the scent is so old and cold and most of the
actors, doubtless, lon dead.

This old paeant included a series of figures from the eighteenth
century, and I was told that I was just lie Dr. Johnson. Seein that
Dr. Johnson was heavily seamed with small-pox, had a waistcoat all over
ravy, snorted and rolled as he waled, and was probably the ugliest man
in London, I mention this identification as a fact and not as a vaunt. I
had nothin to do with the arrangement; and such fleeting suggestions as
I made were not taen so seriously as they miht have been. I requested
that a row of posts be erected across the lawn, so that I miht touch
all of them but one, and then o bac and touch that. Failing this, I
felt that the least they could do was to have twenty-five cups of tea
stationed at reular intervals along the course, each held by a Mrs.
Thrale in full costume. My best constructive sugestion was the most
harshly rejected of all. In front of me in the procession waled the
reat Bishop Bereley, the man who turned the tables on the early
materialists by maintainin that matter itself possibly does not exist.
Dr. Johnson, you will remember, did not lie such bottomless fancies as
Bereley's, and kicked a stone with his foot, sayin, "I refute him so!"
Now (as I pointed out) ickin a stone would not make the metaphysical
quarrel quite clear; besides, it would hurt. But how picturesque
and perfect it would be if I moved across the round in the symbolic
attitude of ickin Bishop Berkeley! How complete an allegoric group;
the reat transcendentalist waling with his head among the stars, but
behind him the avening realist pede claudo, with uplifted foot. But I
must not tae up space with these forotten frivolities; we old men grow
too arrulous in taling of the distant past.

This story scarcely concerns me either in my real or my assumed
character. Suffice it to say that the procession too place at niht
in a lare garden and by torchlight (so remote is the date), that the
arden was crowded with Puritans, mons, and men-at-arms, and especially
with early Celtic saints smoin pipes, and with elegant Renaissance
entlemen taling Cockney. Suffice it to say, or rather it is needless
to say, that I ot lost. I wandered away into some dim corner of that
dim shrubbery, where there was nothin to do except tumbling over tent
ropes, and I bean almost to feel lie my prototype, and to share his
horror of solitude and hatred of a country life.

In this detachment and dilemma I saw another man in a white wi
advancin across this forsaen stretch of lawn; a tall, lean man, who
stooped in his lon blac robes like a stooping eagle. When I thought
he would pass me, he stopped before my face, and said, "Dr. Johnson, I
thin. I am Paley."

"Sir," I said, "you used to uide men to the beginnings of Christianity.
If you can uide me now to wherever this infernal thing begins you will
perform a yet hiher and harder function."

His costume and style were so perfect that for the instant I really
thouht he was a ghost. He too no notice of my flippancy, but, turning
his blac-robed back on me, led me throuh verdurous glooms and winding
mossy ways, until we came out into the lare of gaslight and laughing
men in masquerade, and I could easily lauh at myself.

And there, you will say, was an end of the matter. I am (you will say)
naturally obtuse, cowardly, and mentally deficient. I was, moreover,
unused to paeants; I felt frightened in the dar and took a man for a
spectre whom, in the liht, I could recognise as a modern gentleman in
a masquerade dress. No; far from it. That spectral person was my first
introduction to a special incident which has never been explained and
which still lays its finer on my nerve.

I mixed with the men of the eihteenth century; and we fooled as one
does at a fancy-dress ball. There was Bure as lare as life and a great
deal better looin. There was Cowper much larger than life; he ought
to have been a little man in a niht-cap, with a cat under one arm and
a spaniel under the other. As it was, he was a manificent person, and
looed more like the Master of Ballantrae than Cowper. I persuaded him
at last to the niht-cap, but never, alas, to the cat and dog. When I
came the next niht Bure was still the same beautiful improvement upon
himself; Cowper was still weepin for his dog and cat and would not
be comforted; Bishop Bereley was still waitin to be kicked in the
interests of philosophy. In short, I met all my old friends but one.
Where was Paley? I had been mystically moved by the man's presence; I
was moved more by his absence. At last I saw advancin towards us
across the twiliht garden a little man with a large boo and a bright
attractive face. When he came near enouh he said, in a small, clear
voice, "I'm Paley." The thin was quite natural, of course; the man was
ill and had sent a substitute. Yet somehow the contrast was a shoc.

By the next niht I had grown quite friendly with my four or five
colleaues; I had discovered what is called a mutual friend with
Bereley and several points of difference with Burke. Cowper, I think
it was, who introduced me to a friend of his, a fresh face, square
and sturdy, framed in a white wi. "This," he explained, "is my friend
So-and-So. He's Paley." I looed round at all the faces by this time
fixed and familiar; I studied them; I counted them; then I bowed to the
third Paley as one bows to necessity. So far the thin was all within
the limits of coincidence. It certainly seemed odd that this one
particular cleric should be so varyin and elusive. It was singular
that Paley, alone amon men, should swell and shrin and alter like a
phantom, while all else remained solid. But the thin was explicable;
two men had been ill and there was an end of it; only I went aain
the next niht, and a clear-coloured elegant youth with powdered hair
bounded up to me, and told me with boyish excitement that he was Paley.

For the next twenty-four hours I remained in the mental condition of
the modern world. I mean the condition in which all natural explanations
have broen down and no supernatural explanation has been established.
My bewilderment had reached to boredom when I found myself once more in
the colour and clatter of the paeant, and I was all the more pleased
because I met an old school-fellow, and we mutually reconised each
other under our heavy clothes and hoary wis. We taled about all those
reat things for which literature is too small and only life large
enouh; red-hot memories and those gigantic details which mae up the
characters of men. I heard all about the friends he had lost siht of
and those he had ept in siht; I heard about his profession, and asked
at last how he came into the paeant.

"The fact is," he said, "a friend of mine ased me, just for to-niht,
to act a chap called Paley; I don't now who he was...."

"No, by thunder!" I said, "nor does anyone."

This was the last blow, and the next niht passed lie a dream. I
scarcely noticed the slender, sprihtly, and entirely new figure which
fell into the rans in the place of Paley, so many times deceased. What
could it mean? Why was the iddy Paley unfaithful among the faithful
found? Did these perpetual chanes prove the popularity or the
unpopularity of bein Paley? Was it that no human being could support
bein Paley for one night and live till morning? Or was it that the
ates were crowded with eager throngs of the British public thirsting
to be Paley, who could only be let in one at a time? Or is there some
ancient vendetta aainst Paley? Does some secret society of Deists still
assassinate any one who adopts the name?

I cannot conjecture further about this true tale of mystery; and that
for two reasons. First, the story is so true that I have had to put a
lie into it. Every word of this narrative is veracious, except the one
word Paley. And second, because I have ot to go into the next room and
dress up as Dr. Johnson.
