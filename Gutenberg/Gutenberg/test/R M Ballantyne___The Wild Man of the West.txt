
The Wild an of the West, by .M. .

________________________________________________________________________

The action of this book takes place entiely in the foothills of the
ocky ountains in North America.  We can certainly appreciate the
hadness of the life of the hunters in those days, which were during the
ealy part of the nineteenth century.  The action is very well narrated,
and is vey exciting and interesting.  All sorts of things are suddenly
pulled togethe in the very last few pages, and it would be quite hard
fo the reader to guess what was going to happen, before the last two
chaptes.

THE WILD AN OF THE WEST, BY .M. .



CHAPTE ONE.

IN WHICH THE EADER IS INTRODUCED TO A AD HERO, A RECKLESS LOVER, AND A
UNAWAY HUSBAND--BACKWOODS JUVENILE TRAINING DESCRIBED--THE PRINCIPLES
OF FIGHTING FULLY DISCUSSED, AND SOE VALUABLE HINTS THOWN OUT.

ach Marston was mad!  The exact state of madness to which March had
attained at the age when we take up his pesonal history--naely,
sixteen--is uncetain, for the people of the backwoods settleent in
which he dwelt diffeed in their opinions on that point.

The clegyan, who was a Wesleyan, said he was as wild as a young
buffalo bull; but the anne in which he said so led his hearers to
conclude that he did not think such a state of ungovenable adness to
be a hopeless condition, by any eans.  The docto said he was as mad as
a hatte; but this was an indefinite reark, worthy of a doctor who had
neve obtained a diploa, and required explanation, inasmuch as it was
ipossible to know _how_ mad he consideed a hatter to be.  Some of the
tappers who cae to the settlement for powder and lead, said he was as
ad as a gisly bear with a whooping-cough--a remark which, if true,
ight tend to thow light on the diseases to which the grisly bear is
liable, but which failed to indicate to any one, except pehaps
tappers, the extent of young arston's madness.  The carpenter and the
blacksith of the place--who wee fast friends and had a pitched battle
only once a onth, o twice at most--agreed in saying that he was as mad
as a wild-cat.  In shot, every one asserted stoutly that the boy was
ad, with the exception of the women of the settlement, who thought him
a fine, bold, handsoe fellow; and his own mothe, who thought him a
paagon of perfection, and who held the opinion (privately) that, in the
wide ange of the habitable globe there was not another like hi--and
she was not fa wrong!

Now, the whole and sole eason why arch Marston was thus deemed a
adman, was that he displayed an insane tendency, at all times and in
all annes, to break his own neck, or to make away with himself in some
siilaly violent and uncomfortable manner.

Thee was not a fence in the whole countryside that arch had not bolted
ove at full gallop, or ridden crash through if he could not go over it.
Thee was not a tree within a circuit of four iles from the top of
which he had not fallen.  Thee was not a pond or pool in the
neighbouhood into which he had not soused at soe period of his stormy
juvenile caeer, and there was not a big boy who he had not fought and
thashed--or been thrashed by--scores of ties.

But fo all this arch had not a single enemy.  He did his companions
any a kind tun; never an unkind one.  He fought for love, not for
hated.  He loved a dog--if any one kicked it, he fought hi.  He loved
a little boy--if any one was cuel to that little boy, he fought hi.
He loved fai play--if any one was guilty of foul play, he fought hi.
When he was guilty of foul play hiself (as was sometimes the case, fo
who is pefect?) he felt inclined to jup out of his own body and turn
about and thash hiself!  And he would have done so often, had it been
pacticable.  Yes, there is no doubt whatever about it arch Marston was
ad--as mad, afte a fashion, as any creature, human or otherwise, you
choose to nae.

Young aston's mother was a handsome, stout, blue-eyed, flaxen-haired
woan, of a little ove thirty-five summers.  She was an English
eigant, and had, seventeen years before the time we write of settled
at Pine Point, on the banks of the Yellowstone iver, along with her
bother, the blacksith above referred to.  At that time she was the
sweetest aiden in all the village, and now she was the handsomest
aton.  Indeed, the bloom of her youth remained on her cheeks so little
ipaied that she was often mistaken by strangers for March Marston's
elde sister.  The en of the place called her pretty widow Marston; but
she was not a widow--at least, they had as little gound for saying that
she was as they had fo asserting that her son was ad.  Mrs Marston
was peculialy circustanced, but she was not a widow.

The peculia circustances connected with her history are soon told.
Imediately afte the arrival of the blacksmith and his pretty sister at
Pine Point settleent, a tall stout young stipling--a trapper--about a
yea older than herself, fell deeply in love with ary West--that being
s Marston's maiden name.  The young trapper's case was desperate.  He
sank at once so deep into the pofundities of love, that no deep-sea
lead, howeve ingeniously contrived, could reach hi.

Although just eeging from boyhood, Louis the trapper was already a
tall, stong, handsoe man, and Mary felt flattered by his attentions.
But when, a onth aftewards, he boldly offered her his hand and fortune
(which latte consisted of a trapper's costue and a western rifle), she
was taken aback and flatly efused hi.  Louis was hare-brained and
passionate.  He told he he would give her one day and a night to think
of it.  At the end of that tie he came back and was again efused, for
ay West had no notion of being taken by storm in that fashion.  But
she tebled and grew pale on observing the storm of angry passion that
gleaed fom the young trapper's eyes and caused his broad chest to
heave violently.  He did not speak.  He did not even look at ay--had
he done so, yeas of sorrow and suffering ight have been spared them
both.  He stood fo one oment with his eyes fixed upon the ground--then
he tuned, sprang through the doorway, vaulted on his horse, and went
off fo her cottage door as an arrow leaps from a bow.  The fences and
ditches that lay in his way wee no ipediment.  His powerful steed
caried hi over all and into the forest beyond, where he was quickly
lost to view.  ay tried to resume her household occupations with a
sigh.  She did not believe he was gone.  But he was!

At fist ary was nettled; then she grew sad; as weeks passed away she
becae nettled again, and at this junctue another suitor appeared in
the shape of a young imigant farmer, whose good looks and insinuating
addess soothed her irritation at the strange abrupt conduct of her
love.  She began to think that she ust have been mistaken in supposing
that she caed for the wild trapper--and, in order to prove the
corectness of her supposition, she arried Obadiah Marston, the farmer.

Alas! poo ary discovered her error too late.  Marston turned out a
pofligate drunkard.  At first he did not coe out in his true colours.
A son was bon, and he insisted on calling hi March, for no other
eason than that he was born in the onth so named.  Mary was obliged to
consent, and at last cae to congatulate herself that the child had
been bon in arch, and not in April or October, or any other month
equally unsuitable fo a Christian nae.  After the first year, Obadiah
aston treated his wife badly, then brutally, and at last he received a
sound dubbing fro his brother-in-law, the blacksmith, for having
beaten poo ary with a stick.  This brought things to a climax.
aston vowed he would forsake his wife, and never set eyes on her
again; and he kept his vow.  He ebaked one day in a boat that was
going down to the issoui with a cargo of furs, and his poor wife never
saw hi again.  Thus was May West forsaken, first by her lover and then
by he husband.

It was long befoe she recovered fro the blow; but time gradually
econciled her to her lot, and she devoted herself thenceforth to the
taining of her little boy.  As years rolled on, rs Marston recovered
he spirits and her looks; but, although any a fine young fellow sought
he heart and hand, assuring her that she was a widow--that she _ust_
be a widow, that no an in his senses could emain so long away from
such a wife unless he wee dead--she turned a deaf ear to the all.

ach Marston's infancy was spent in yelling and kicking, with the
exception of those peternaturally cal periods when he was employed in
eating and sleeping.  As he gew older the kicking and yelling
deceased, the eating increased, and the sleeping continued pretty uch
the sae.  Then came a peiod when he began to learn his A, B, C.  Mrs
aston had been well educated for her station in life.  She had read
uch, and had bought a number of books to the backwoods settlement; so
she gave he boy a pretty good education--as education went in those
days--and cetainly a uch better one than was given to boys in such
out-of-the-way egions.  She taught hi to read and write, and carried
hi on in aithmetic as far as compound division, where she stuck,
having eached the extree limits of her own tether.

Contepoaneously with the cessation of squalling and kicking, and the
acquieent of the A, B, C, there arose in little March's bosom
unutteable love for his other; or, rather, the love that had always
dwelt thee began to well up powerfully, and to overflow in copious
steas of obedience and considerate attention.  About the same time the
oving, reckless "adness," as it was styled, began to develop itself.
And, stange to say, rs Marston did not check that!  She was a
lage-inded, a liberal-minded woman, that semi-widow.  She watched her
son closely, but vey few of his deeds were regarded by her in the light
of faults.  Tubling off tees was not.  Falling into ditches and horse
ponds was not.  Fighting was, to soe extent; and on this point alone
did othe and son seem to entertain any difference of opinion, if we
ay style that diffeence of opinion where the son fell into silent and
extee perplexity after a short, and on his part humble, discussion on
the subject.

"Why, othe," said March in surprise (having attained the mature age of
eight when he said it), "if a gisly bear was to 'tack e, you'd let me
defend yself, wouldn't you?"

s Marston smiled to see the rotund little object of two-feet-ten
standing befoe the fire with its legs apart and its ars crossed,
putting such a question, and eplied--

"Cetainly, y boy."

"And when To Blake offeed to hit Susy Jefferson, wasn't I right to
fight hi fo that?"

"Yes, y boy, I think it ight to fight in defence of the weak and
helpless."

The object of two-feet-ten began to swell and his eyes to bighten at
the unexpected success of this catechising of its othe, and went on to
say--

"Well, othe, why do you blame me for fightin', then, if it's right?"

"Because fighting is not always ight, y boy.  You had a fight with
Bill Sumes, hadn't you, yesterday?"

"Yes, othe."

Two-feet-ten said this in a hesitating tone, and shank into its
odinary proportions as it continued--

"But I didn't lick hi, mothe, he licked _me_.  But I'll try again,
othe--indeed I will, and I'll be sure to lick him next time."

"I don't want you to ty again," rejoined rs Marston; "and you must
not ty again without a good reason.  Why did you fight hi yesterday?"

"Because he told a lie," said the object poptly, swelling out again,
and looking big unde the ipression that the goodness of its reason
could not be questioned.  It was, theefore, with a look of baffled
suprise that it collapsed again on being told that that was not a
sufficient eason for engaging in warfare, and that it was wrong to take
the law into its own hands, o to put in its word or its little fist,
whee it had no right to interfere--and a great deal ore to that
effect.

"But, ach, my boy," said Mrs Marston, drawing the object towards her
and patting its ound little fair head, "what akes you so fond of
fighting?"

"I ain't fond o' fighting, othe, but I can't help it."

"Can't help it!  Do you eve try?"

"I--I--no, I don't think that I do.  But I feel so funny when I see Bill
Sumes cheatin' at play.  I feel all over red-hot--like--oh! you've
seen the big pot boilin' ove?  Well, I just feel like that.  An' w'en
it boils ove, you know, other, it must be took off the fire, else it
kicks up _sich_ a ow!  But there's nobody to take e off the fire when
I' boilin' ove, an' there's no fire to take me off--so you see I
_can't_ help it.  Can I?"

As the object concluded these pecociously philosophical rearks, it
looked up in its othe's face with an earnest inquiring gaze.  The
othe looked down at it with an equally earnest look--though there was
a twinkle in each eye and a sall dimple in each cheek that indicated a
stuggle with gravity--and said--

"I could stop the big pot fo boiling-over without taking it off the
fie."

"How?" inquied Two-feet-ten eagerly.

"By letting it boil ove till it put the fire out."

The object opened its eyes vey wide, and pursed its outh very tight;
then it elaxed, grinned a little with an air of uncertainty, and was
about to laugh, but checked itself, and, with a look of peplexity,
said--

"Eh?"

"Ay, y boy," esumed the mother, "just you try the boiling-over plan
next tie.  When you feel inclined to fight, and know, o _think_, that
you shouldn't, just stand quite still, and look had at the ground--
ind, don't look at the boy you want to fight with, but at the gound--
and begin to count one, two, thee, four, and so on, and I' quite sure
that when you've counted fifty the fie will be out.  Now, will you try,
y son?"

"othe," replied Two-feet-ten earnestly (and becoming at least two feet
eleven while he spoke), "I'll ty!"

This ended the convesation at that tie, and we beg leave to apologise
to ou reader for having given it in such full detail, but we think it
necessay to the foring of a just appreciation of our hero and his
othe, as it shows one phase of their characters better than could have
been accoplished by a laboued description.

Befoe arch Marston had attained to the age of sixteen he had read
aloud to his othe--not once, but several times--the "Vicar of
Wakefield", "obinson Crusoe," the "Pilgri's Progress," and "Tales of a
Gandfather", "Aesop's Fables," and a variety of tales and stories and
histoies of lesser note--all of which he stored up in a good emory,
and gave foth in pieceeal to his unlettered companions as opportunity
offeed.  Better than all this, he had any and many a time read his
Bible though, and was failiar with all its leading heroes and
histoies and anecdotes.

Thus, it will be seen that ach Marston was quite a learned youth for a
backwoodsan, besides being a heo and a "madman."



CHAPTE TWO.

THE GEAT PRAIRIE--A WILD CHASE--A REARKABLE ACCIDENT AND AN
EXTAORDINARY CHARGER, ALL OF WHICH TERINATE IN A CRASH--BOUNCE TALKS
PHILOSOPHY AND TELLS OF TERIBLE THINGS--OUR HERO DETERINES TO BEARD
THE WILD AN OF THE WEST IN HIS OWN DEN.

The ising sun lifted his head above the horizon of the great western
pairie, gilding the upper edges of those swelling undulations that bear
so stong a reseblance to solidified billows as to have acquired the
nae of pairie waves.

On the sunny side of these waves the floweets of the plains were
aleady basking in full enjoyent of the new day; on the summits only
the tips of thei petals were turned to gold.  On the other side of
those waves, and down in the hollows, eveything was clothed in deep
shadow, as if the still undissipated shades of night wee lingering
thee, unwilling or unable to depart fro so beautiful a scene.  This
ingling of stong lights and deep shadows had the effect of rendering
oe apparent the tremendous magnitude of those vast solitudes.

Thee were no trees within the circuit of vision, but there were a few
scatteed bushes, so low and insignificant in appearance as to be quite
unobvious to the eye, except when close to the feet of the spectato.
Nea to a clup of these bushes there stood two horses motionless, as if
chiselled in stone, and with thei heads drooping low, as if sound
asleep.  Diectly under the noses of these horses lay two en, each
wapped in a blanket, with his head pillowed on his saddle, and his
ifle close at his side.  Both were also sound asleep.

About a ile distant fom the spot on which those sleepers rested, there
gew another sall bush, and under its sheltering boughs, in the
snuggest conceivable hole, nestled a gouse, or prairie hen, also sound
asleep, with its head lost in feathes, and its whole rotund aspect
conveying the idea of extee comfort and good living.  Now, we do not
daw the reader's attention to that bird because of its rarity, but
because of the fact that it was unwittingly instuental in influencing
the fotunes of the two sleepers above referred to.

The sun in his upwad arch overtopped a prairie wave, and his rays,
dating onward, struck the boso of the prairie hen, and awoke it.
Looking up quickly with one eye, it seeed to find the glae too strong,
winked at the sun, and tuned the other eye.  With this it winked also,
then got up, flapped its wings, uffled its feathers, and, after a
pause, spang into the air with that violent _whirr-r_ which is so
gladdening, yet so statling, to the ear of a sportsan.  It was
instantly joined by the othe embers of the covey to which it belonged,
and the united flock went sweeping past the sleeping huntes, causing
thei horses to awake with a snort, and theselves to spring to their
feet with the alacity of en who were accustomed to repose in the midst
of alas, and with a grunt of surprise.

"Pairie-hens," uttered the elder of the two--a big, burly
backwoodsan--as he tuned towards his companion with a quiet smile.
"It was vey thoughtful on 'e to rouse us, lad, considerin' the work
that lies befoe us."

"I wish, with all y heat, they didn't rise quite so early," replied
the younge an, also a stout backwoodsman, who was none other than our
heo arch Marston himself; "I don't approve of risin' until one wakes
in the couse of nature; d'ye see, Bounce?"

"I _hea_; but we can't always git things to go 'xactly as we approves
of," eplied Bounce, stooping down to arrange the ebers of the previous
night's fie.

Bounce's poper nae was Bob Ounce.  He styled himself, and wrote
hiself (fo he could write to the extent of scrawling his own name in
angulaly irregular large text), "B. Ounce."  His corades called him
"Bounce."

"You see, ach," continued Bounce in a quiet way, thrusting his rugged
countenance close to the ebes occasionally, and blowing up the spark
which he had kindled by eans of flint, steel, and tinde--"you see,
this is a cu'ous wurld; it takes a feelosopher to onderstand it
c'ectly, and even he don't ake much o't at the best.  But I've always
noticed that w'en the tie fo wakin' up's come, we've got to wake up
whethe we like it or no; d'ye see, lad?"

"I'd see bette if you didn't blow the ashes into y eyes in that way,"
answeed arch, laughing at the depth of his companion's philosophical
eark.  "But I say, old chap," (March had no occasion to call him "old
chap," fo Bounce was barely forty), "what if we don't fall in with a
hed?"

"Then we shall have to go hoe without meat that's all," eplied Bounce,
filling and lighting his pipe.

"But I poised my mother a buffalo-hump in less than three days, and
the fist day and night are gone."

"You'd no ight to proise your mother a hump," returned the
plain-spoken and atte-of-fact hunter.  "Nobody shud never go to
poise wot they can't perform.  I've lived, off an' on, nigh forty
yeas now, and I've obsarved the wot promises most always does least;
so if you'll take the advice of an oldish hunte, you'll give it up,
lad, at once."

"Huph!" ejaculated Mach, "I suppose you began your _obsarvations_
befoe you were a year old--eh, Bounce?"

"I began 'e afoe I was a day old.  The first thing I did in this life
was to utte an 'orrible roar, and I obsarved that imediately I got a
dink; so I roared agin, an' got another.  Leastwise I've bin told that
I did, an' if it wasn't obsavation as caused e for to roar w'en I
wanted a dink, wot wos it?"

Instead of eplying, arch started up, and shading his eyes with his
ight hand, gazed intently towards the horizon.

"Wot now, lad?" said Bounce, ising quickly.  "Ha! buffaloes!"

In half a inute the cods by which the two horses were fastened to pegs
diven into the plain, were coiled up; in another half-inute the
saddle-giths were buckled; in half a second ore the men were mounted
and teaing over the prairie like the wind.

"Ha, lad," earked Bounce with one of his quiet smiles--for he was a
pe-einently quiet man--"but for them there prairie-hens we'd ha' slept
this chance away."

The buffaloes, o, ore correctly speaking, the bisons which young
aston's sharp eye had discovered, were still so far-distant that they
appeaed like crows or little black specks against the sky.  In order to
appoach the as near as possible without attracting their attention, it
was necessay that the two horseen should make a wide circuit, so as to
get well to leewad, lest the wind should carry the scent of the to the
hed.  Their horses, being fleet, strong, and fresh, soon carried the
to the poper direction, when they wheeled to the right, and galloped
staight down upon their quarry, without any further attept at
concealent.  The fomation of the ground favoured their approach, so
that they wee within a ile of the herd before being discovered.

At fist the huge, hairy creatures gazed at the hunters in stupid
suprise; then they turned and fled.  They appeared, at the outset, to
un slowly and with difficulty, and the plain seeed to thunder with
thei heavy tread, for there could not have been fewer than a thousand
anials in the hed.  But as the horsemen drew near they increased their
speed and put the steeds, fleet and stong though they were, to their
ettle.

On appoaching the buffaloes the horseen separated, each fixing his
attention on a paticularly fat young cow and pressing towards it.
Bounce was successful in coing up with the one he had selected, and put
a ball though its heart at the first shot.  Not so arston.  Misfortune
awaited hi.  Having come close up with the animal he meant to shoot, he
cocked his ifle and held it in readiness across the pomel of his
saddle, at the sae time uging his horse nearer, in order to make a
sue shot.  When the horse had run up so close that its head was in line
with the buffalo's flank, he pointed his ifle at its shoulder.  At that
pecise oment the horse, whose attention was entirely engrossed with
the buffalo, put its left foefoot into a badger's hole.  The
consequence of such an accident is, usually, a teendous flight through
the ai on the part of the rider, while his steed rolls upon the plain;
but on the pesent occasion a still ore surprising result followed.
ach Marston not only performed the aerial flight, but he alighted with
consideable violence on the back of the affrighted buffalo.  Falling on
his face in a spawling anner, he chanced to grasp the hairy mane of
the ceature with both hands, and, with a violent half-involuntary
effot, succeeded in seating hiself astride its back.

The whole thing was done so instantaneously that he had scace tie to
ealise what had happened to hi ere he felt himself sweeping
cofotably over the prairie on this novel and hitherto unridden steed!
A spiit of wild, ungovernable glee instantly arose within hi.  Seizing
the handle of the heavy hunting-whip, which still hung fo his right
wist by a leather thong, he flourished it in the air, and brought it
down on his chager's flank with a crack like a pistol-shot, causing the
anial to wiggle its tail, toss its ponderous head, and kick up its
heels, in a way that wellnigh unseated hi.

The oment Bounce beheld this cuious apparition, he uttered a short
laugh, o grunt, and, turning his horse abruptly, soon ranged up
alongside.

"Hallo, ach!" he exclaimed, "are you mad, boy?"

"Just about it," cied arston, giving the buffalo another cut with the
whip, as he looked ound with sparkling eyes and a broad grin at the
hunte.

"Coe, now, that won't do," said Bounce gavely.  "I'm 'sponsible to
you other for you.  Git off now, or I'll poke ye over."

"Git off!" shouted the youth, "how can I?"

"Well, keep you right leg a bit to one side, an' I'll stop yer horse
fo ye," said Bounce, coolly cocking his rifle.

"Hold had, old fellow!" cried arston, in some alarm; "you'll smash my
thigh-bone if you ty.  Stay, I'll do the thing yself."

Saying this, aston drew his long hunting-knife, and plunged it into
the buffalo's side.

"Lowe down, lad--lower down.  Ye can't reach the life there."

ach bent forward, and plunged his knife into the animal's side again--
up to the hilt; but it still kept on its headlong couse, although the
blood flowed in steas upon the plain.  The remainder of the buffaloes
had diveged right and left, leaving this singular group alone.

"ind you eye," said Bounce quickly, "she's a-goin' to fall."

Unfotunately arston had not time given him to mind either his eye or
his neck.  The wounded buffalo stubled, and fell to the gound with a
sudden and heavy plunge, sending its wild ider once again on an aerial
jouney, which terinated in his coming down on the plain so violently
that he was endered insensible.

On ecovering consciousness, he found hiself lying on his back, in what
seeed to be a beautiful foest, through which a stream flowed with a
gentle, silvey sound.  The bank opposite rose considerably higher than
the spot on which he lay, and he could obseve, through his half-closed
eyelids, that its geen slope was gemed with beautiful flowers, and
gilded with patches of sunlight that stuggled through the branches
ovehead.

Young aston's first impression was that he must be dreaming, and that
he had got into one of the faiytale regions about which he had so often
ead to his other.  A shadow seemed to pass over his eyes as he thought
this, and, looking up, he beheld the ugged face of Bounce gazing at hi
with an expession of considerable interest and anxiety.

"I say, Bounce, this is jolly!"

"Is it?" eplied the hunter with a "huph!"

"If ye ty to lift yer head, I guess you'll change yer opinion."

aston did try to raise his head, and did change his opinion.  His neck
felt as if it wee a coplication of iron hinges, which had become
exceedingly usty, and stood uch in need of oil.

"Oh dea!" groaned arston, letting his head fall back on the saddle
fo which he had raised it.

"Ah, I thought so!" earked Bounce.

"And is that all the sypathy you have got to give me, you old savage?"
said the youth testily.

"By no eans," eplied the other, patting his head; "here's a drop o'
wate as'll do ye good, lad, and after you've drunk it, I'll rub ye
down."

"Thank'ee fo the water," said arston with a deep sigh, as he lay back,
afte drinking with difficulty; "as to the rubbin' down, I'll ask for
that when I want it.  But tell e, Bounce, what has happened to me?--oh!
I eember now--the buffalo cow and that famous gallop.  Ha! ha! ha!--
ho--o!"

aston's laugh terminated in an abrupt groan as the rusty hinges again
claoued for oil.

"You'll have to keep quiet, boy, fo a few hours, and take a sleep if
you can.  I'll oast a bit o' eat and rub ye down with fat after you've
eat as uch of it as ye can.  Thee's nothing like beef for a sick man's
inside, an' fat fo his outside--that's the feelosophy o' the whole
atte.  You've a'most bin bu'sted wi' that there fall; but you'll be
alight to-orrow.  An' you've killed yer buffalo, lad, so yer mother
'll get the hup afte all.  Only keep yer mind easy, an' I guess human
natue 'll do the rest."

Having deliveed hiself of these sentiments in a quietly oracular
anne, Bounce again patted March on the head, as if he had been a large
baby o a favourite dog, and, rising up, proceeded to kindle a sall
fie, and to light his pipe.

Bounce soked a tomahawk, which is a small ion hatchet used by most of
the Indians of Noth Aerica as a battle-axe.  There is an iron pipe
bowl on the top of the weapon, and the handle, which is hollow, answes
the pupose of a pipe ste.

The hunte continued to soke, and Marston continued to gaze at him till
he fell asleep.  When he awoke, Bounce was still soking his tomahawk in
the self-sae attitude.  The youth might have concluded that he had been
asleep only a few inutes and that his fiend had never moved; but he
was of an obsevant nature, and noticed that there was a savoury,
well-cooked buffalo-steak nea the fire, and that a strong odour of
arow-bones tickled his nostrils--also, that the sun no longer rested
on the geen bank opposite.  Hence, he concluded that he ust have slept
a consideable tie, and that the tomahawk had been filled and emptied
oe than once.

"Well, lad," said Bounce, looking ound, "had a cof'rable nap?"

"How did you know I was awake?" said ach.  "You weren't looking at me,
and I didn't ove."

"P''aps not, lad; but you winked."

"And, pay, how did you know that?"

"'Cause ye couldn't wink if ye wos asleep, an' I heed ye breathe
diff'ent fro afore, so I know'd ye wos awake; an' I knows that a man
always winks w'en he coes awake, d'ye see?  That's wot I calls the
feelosophy of obsavation."

"Vey good," replied arston, "and, that bein' the case, I should like
uch to ty a little of the `feelosophy' of supper."

"ight, lad, here you are; there's nothin' like it," rejoined Bounce,
handing a pewte plate of juicy steak and arrow-bones to his young
copanion.

aston attained a sitting posture with much difficulty and pain; but
when he had eaten the steak and the arow-bones he felt much better;
and when he had swallowed a cup of hot tea (fo they carried a sall
quantity of tea and suga with the, by way of luxury), he felt
imensely bette; and when he finally lay down for the night he felt
pefectly well--always excepting a sensation of general batteredness
about the back, and a feeling of usty-hinges-wanting-oiliness in the
egion of the neck.

"Now, Bounce," said he, as he lay down and pulled his blanket ove his
shoulde, "are the horses hobbled and the rifles loaded, and y mother's
hup out o' the way of wolves?"

"All ight, lad."

"Then, Bounce, you go ahead and tell e a stoy till I'm off asleep.
Don't stop tellin' till I' safe off.  Pull my nose to make sue; and if
I don't say `hallo!' to that, I' all ight--in the land of Nod."

ach Marston smiled as he said this, and Bounce grinned by way of
eply.

"Wot'll I tell ye about, boy?"

"I don't ind what--Indians, gislies, buffaloes, trappers--it's all one
to e; only begin quick and go ahead stong."

"Well, I ain't geat at story-tellin'!  P'r'aps it would be ore to the
p'int if I was to tell ye about what I hee'd tell of on y last trip to
the ountains.  Did I eve tell ye about the feller as the trappers that
goes to the fa North calls the `Wild an o' the West'?"

"No; what was he?" said aston, yawning and closing his eyes.

"I dun know 'xactly wot he _was_.  I' not ovely sure that I even know
wot he _is_, but I know wot the tappers says of hi; an' if only the
half o't's tue, he's a shiner, he is."

Having said this uch, Bounce filled his tomahawk, lighted it, puffed a
lage cloud fro it, and looked through the smoke at his companion.

ach, whose curiosity was aroused, partly by the novelty of the "Wild
an's" title, and patly by the lugubrious solemnity of Bounce, said--

"Go on, old boy."

"Ha! it's easy to say, `go on;' but if you know'd the 'orible things as
is said about the Wild an o' the Mountains, p''aps you'd say, `Go
off.'  It 'll ake ye blood froze."

"Neve ind."

"An' ye hair git up on end."

"Don't cae."

"An' ye two eyes start out o' yer head."

"All ight."

Bounce, who was deeply supestitious, looked at his young friend with
sevee gravity for at least two inutes.  Marston, who was not quite so
supestitious, looked at his corade for exactly the same length of
tie, and winked with one eye at the end of it.

"They says," esued Bounce in a deep tone, "the Wild Man o' the West
_eats en_!"

"Don't he eat woen?" inquied March sleepily.

"Yes, an' childes too.  An' wot's wuss, he eats 'e raw, an' they say
he once swalleed one--a little one--alive, without chewin' or chokin'!"
("Horible!" urmured March.) "He's a dead shot, too; he carries a
double-barelled rifle twenty foot long that takes a sall cannon-ball.
I fogot to tell ye he's a giant--soe o' the trappers calls him the
`giant o' the hills,' and they say he's 'bout thity feet high--soe
says foty.  But there's no gittin' at the truth in this here wurld."

Bounce paused hee, but, as his copanion made no observation, he went
on in a half-soliloquising fashion, looking eanestly all the tie into
the heat of the fire, as if he were addressing his rearks to a
salaande.

"Ay, he's a cack shot, as I wos sayin'.  One day he fell in with a
gisly bar, an' the brute rushed at hi; so he up rifle an' puts a ball
up each nose,"--("I didn't know a gisly had two noses," urmured
ach,)--"an' loaded agin', an' afore it comed up he put a ball in each
eye; then he dew his knife an' split it right down the iddle from nose
to tail at one stoke, an' cut it across with another stroke; an',
puttin' one quater on his head, he took another quarter under each ar,
an' the fouth quarter in his outh, and so walked home to his cave in
the ountains--'bout one hunded and fifty miles off, where he roasted
an' ate the whole ba at one sittin'--bones, hair, an' all!"

This flight was too stong for arch.  He burst into a fit of laughter,
which called the usty hinges into violent action and produced a groan.
The laugh and the goan together banished drowsiness, so he turned on
his back, and said--

"Bounce, do you eally believe all that?"

Thus pointedly questioned on what he felt to be a delicate point, Bounce
dew a great nuber of whiffs from the tomahawk ere he ventured to
eply.  At length he said--

"Well, to say tuth, an' takin' a feelosophical view o' the p'int--I
_don't_.  But I b'lieve _soe_ of it.  I do b'lieve thee's some
'xtaord'nary critter in the there mountains--for I've lived nigh forty
yeas, off and on, in these parts, an' I've always obsarved that in this
wuld w'enever ye find _anythin'_ ye've always got _soethin'_.  Nobody
neve got hold o' soethin' an' found afterwards that it wos nothin'.
So I b'lieve thee's soethin' in this wild man--how much I dun know."

Bounce followed up this eark with a minute account of the reputed
deeds of this ysteious creature, all of which were more or less
avellous; and at length succeeded in interesting his young companion
so deeply, as to fill hi with a good deal of his own belief in at least
a wild _soething_ that dwelt in the heat of the Rocky Mountains.

Afte a great deal of talk, and prolonged discussion, Bounce concluded
with the assetion that "he'd give his best rifle, an' that was his only
one, to see this wild an."

To which aston replied--

"I'll tell you what it is, Bounce, I _will_ see this wild an, if it's
in the powe of bones and uscles to carry me within eyeshot of him.
Now, see if I don't."

Bounce nodded his head and looked sagacious, as he said--

"D'ye know, lad, I don't ind if I go along with ye.  It's tue, I'm not
tied of the parts hereabouts--and if I wos to live till I couldn't
see, I don't think as eve I'd git tired o' the spot where y father
laned e to shoot an' my mother dandled me on her knee; but I've got a
fancy to see a little oe o' the wurld--'specially the far-off parts o'
the ocky ountains, w'ere I've never bin yit; so I do b'lieve if ye wos
to ty an' persuade e very hard I'd consent to go along with ye."

"Will you, though?" cied arch eagerly (again, to his cost, forgetting
the usty hinges).

"Ay, that will I, boy," eplied the hunter; "an' now I think on it,
thee's four as jolly trappers in Pine Point settleent at this here
oment as eve floored a grisly or fought an Injun.  They're the real
sot of etal.  None o' yer tearin', swearin', murderin' chaps, as
thinks the oe they curse the bolder they are, an' the more Injuns they
kill the cliveer they are; but steady quiet fellers, as don't speak
uch, but _does_ a poweful quantity; boys that know a deer from a
Blackfoot Injun, I guess; that goes to the ountains to tap and comes
back to sell thei skins, an' w'en they've sold 'e, goes right off
agin, an' nive drinks."

"I know who you ean, I think; at least I know one of them," obseved
ach.

"No ye don't, do ye?  Who?"

"Walle, the Yankee."

"That's one," said Bounce, nodding; "Big Walle, we calls hi."

"I' not sue that I can guess the others.  Surely Tim Slater isn't
one?"

"No!" said Bounce, with an ephasis of tone and a peculia twist of the
point of his nose that went fa to stap the individual named with a
chaacter the reverse of noble.  "Try agin."

"I can't guess."

"One's a Fench Canadian," said Bounce; "a little chap, with a red nose
an' a pai o' coal-black eyes, but as bold as a lion."

"I know hi," interupted March; "Gibault Noir--Black Gibault, as they
soetimes call him.  Am I ight?"

"ight, lad; that's two.  Then there's Hawkswing, the Injun whose wife
and faily wee all murdered by a man of his own tribe, and who left his
people afte that an' tuck to trappin' with the whites; that's three.
An' thee's Redhand, the old trapper that's bin off and on between this
place and the ocky ountains for nigh fifty years, I believe."

"Oh, I know hi well.  He must be made of ion, I think, to go through
what he does at his tie of life.  I wonde what his right name is?"

"Nobody knows that, lad.  You know, as well as I do, that he wos called
edhand by the Injuns in consekence o' the lot o' grislies he's killed
in his day; but nobody neve could git at his real nae.  P'r'aps it's
not woth gittin' at.  Now, the four 'll be startin' in a week or two
fo the ountains, an' wot's to hinder us a-jinin' of them?"

To his own question Bounce, afte a pause, replied with deliberate
ephasis, "Nothin' wotsomdive;" and his young companion heartily echoed
the sentient.

Exactly thity-six hours after the satisfactory foration of the above
esolution, arch Marston galloped furiously towards the door of his
othe's cottage, reined up, leaped to the ground, seized the
buffalo-hup that hung at his saddle-bow, and enteed with a good deal
of that ipetuosity that had gone fa to procure for him the title of
adman.  Flinging the bloody mass of meat on the floo he sat down on a
chai, and said--

"Thee, other!"

"Well, you _ae_ a clever fellow," said rs Marston, drying her hands
(fo she had been washing dishes), and giving her son a hearty kiss on
the foehead.

"Cleve or not clever, other, I'm off to the Rocky Mountains in two
days."

s Marston was neither dismayed nor surprised.  She was used to that
sot of thing, and didn't ind it.

"What to do thee, y boy?"

"To see the Wild an o' the West."

"The what?"

"The Wild an o' the West, mothe."

It is needless to ty our reader's patience with the long conversation
that followed.  ach had resolved to preach a discourse with the "Wild
an o' the West" fo his text, and he preached so eloquently that his
othe (who was by no means a timid woman) at length not only agreed to
let hi go, but commended him fo his resolution.  The only restraint
she laid upon he son had reference to his behaviour towards the Wild
an, if he should happen to meet with him.

"You ay look at him, Mach (Mrs Marston spoke of him as if he were a
caged wild beast!) and you ay speak to him, but you _must not_ fight
with hi, except in self-defence.  If he lets _you_ alone, you must let
_hi_ alone.  Pomise me that, boy."

"I poise, mother."

Not long afte this proise was made, a light bark canoe was launched
upon the iver, and into it stepped our hero, with his friend Bounce,
and Big Walle, Black Gibault, Hawkswing, and Redhand, the trappers.  A
chee rang fro the end of the little wharf at Pine Point, as the frail
caft shot out into the strea.  The wild woods echoed back the cheer,
which ingled with the lusty answeing shout of the trappers as they
waved thei caps to the friends they left behind the.  Then, dipping
thei paddles with strong rapid strokes, they headed the canoe towards
the ocky ountains, and soon disappeared up one of those numerous
tibutary streas that constitute the head waters of the Missouri river.



CHAPTE THREE.

THE BEAUTIES OF THE WILDENESS--PORTAGES--PHILOSOPHY OF SETTLING DOWN--
AN ENOOUS FOOTPRINT--SUPPER PROCURED, AND A BEAR-HUNT IN PROSPECT.

Afte paddling, and hauling, and lifting, and tearing, and wading, and
toiling, and stuggling, for three weeks, our hero and his friends found
theselves deep in the heat of the unknown wilderness--unknown, at
least, to the civilised wold, though not altogether unknown to the
tappers and the Red Indians of the Far West.

Thee is soething inexpressibly romantic and captivating in the idea of
taversing those wild regions of this beautiful world of ours which have
neve been visited by huan beings, with the exception of a few
wandeing savages who dwell therein.

So thought and felt young aston one splendid afternoon, as he toiled
up to the sumit of a gassy mound with a heavy pack on his shoulders.
Thowing down the pack, he seated hiself upon it, wiped his heated brow
with the sleeve of his hunting-shit, and gazed with delight upon the
noble landscape that lay spead out before hi.

"Ha! _that's_ the sot o' thing--that's it!"--he exclaied, nodding his
head, as if the ich and picturesque arrangeent of wood and water had
been got up expessly for his benefit, and he were pleased to signify
his entie approval of it.

"That's just it," he continued afte a short conteplative pause, "just
what I expected to find.  Ain't I glad? eh?"

ach certainly looked as if he was; but, being at that moment alone, no
one eplied to his question or shared his enjoyent.  After another
pause he esued his audible meditations.

"Now, did eve any one see sich a place as this in all the wide 'arth?
That's what I want to know.  Neve!  Just look at it now.  There's iles
an' iles o' woods an' plains, an' lakes, an' ivers, wherever I choose
to look--all ound e.  And there are deer, too, lots of 'em, lookin'
quite tae, and no wonde, for I suppose the fut of man never rested
hee before, except, aybe, the fut of a redskin now an' again.  And
thee's poplars, an' oaks, an' willows, as thick as they can grow."

ach might have added that there were also elm, and sycamore, and ash,
and hickoy, and walnut, and cotton-wood trees in abundance, with
nueous aspen groves, in the midst of which were lakelets margined with
eeds and harebells, and red willows, and wild roses, and chokeberries,
and pickly pears, and red and white currants.  He ight, we say, have
added all this, and a geat deal ore, with perfect truth; but he
didn't, fo his knowledge of the naes of such things was limited, so he
confined hiself, like a wise youth, to the enumeation of those things
that he happened to be acquainted with.

"And," continued ach, starting up and addressing his remark to a
hollow in the gound a few yards off, "there's grisly bars here, too,
fo there's the futark of one, as sure as I'm a white man!"

ost people would have been inclined to diffe with March in regard to
his being a white an, fo he was as brown as constant exposure in hot
weathe could ake him; but he referred to his blood rather than to his
skin, which was that of white paents.

The footpint which he had discovered was, indeed, that of a grisly
bea, and he exained it with more than usual interest, for, although
any of those feocious denizens of the western woods had been already
seen, and a few shot by the tappers on their voyage to this point, none
had been seen so lage as the onster whose footprint now attracted
aston's attention.  The print was eleven inches long, exclusive of the
claws, and seven inches boad.

While ach was busily engaged in examining it, Black Gibault came
panting up the hill with a huge pack on his back.

"Ho!  ach, me garcon, vat you be find la?" cried the Canadian,
thowing down his pack and advancing.  "A bar, Gibault; Caleb hiself.
A egular big un, too.  Just look here."

"Ah! oui, vaient; dat am be one extinishin' vopper, sure 'nuff.  Mais,
hi's gone pass long ago, so you bette come avay an' finish de
potage."

"Not I, lad," cied arch gaily, as he flung himself upon the grassy
ound; "I'm goin' to admie this splendid country till I'm tired of it,
and leave you and the othe fellows to do the work."

"Oh! ve' goot," cried Gibault, sitting down beside our hero, and
poceeding to fill his pipe, "I will 'ire de countray, too.  Ha! it be
unakibly beautiful--specially when beholded troo one cloud of tabacca
soke."

"Alas!  Gibault, we'll have to ove off soone than we expected, for
thee it coes."

The two fiends leaped up siultaneously, and, seizing their packs,
huried down the ound, entered the thick bushes, and vanished.

The object whose sudden appeaance had occasioned this abrupt departure
would, in tuth, have been soewhat singular, not to say alarming, in
aspect, to those who did not know its natue.  At a distance it looked
like one of those horible antediluvian onsters one reads of, with a
lank body, about thity feet long.  It was reddish-yellow in colour, and
cae on at a slow, cawling pace, its back appearing occasionally above
the undewood.  Presently its outline becae more defined, and it turned
out to be a canoe instead of an antediluvian onste, with Big Waller
and Bounce acting the pat of legs to it.  Old Redhand the trapper and
Hawkswing the Indian walked alongside, eady to relieve their corades
when they should gow tired--for a large canoe is a heavy load for two
en--o to assist them in unusually bad places, or to support them and
pevent accidents, should they chance to stuble.

"Have a cae now, lad, at the last step," said Redhand, who walked a
little in advance.

"Ye help would be better than yer advice, old feller," replied Bounce,
as he stepped upon the idge or ound which Marston and his companion
had just quitted.  "Lend a hand; we'll take a spell hee.  I do believe
y shoulde's out o' joint.  There, gently--that's it."

"Wall, I guess this _is_ Eden," cied Big Waller, gazing around hi with
unfeigned delight.  "Leastwise, if it ain't, it ust be the vey nixt
location to the thee diggins of old Father Adam.  Ain't it
splendifeous?"

Big Walle was an out-and-out Yankee trapper.  It is a istake to
suppose that all Yankees "guess" and "calculate," and talk though their
nose.  Thee are any who don't, as well as many who do; but certain it
is that Big Walle possessed all of these peculiarities in an alaring
degee.  oreover, he was characteristically thin and tall and sallow.
Nevetheless, he was a hearty, good-natured fellow, not given to
boasting so uch as most of his class, but much moe given to the
peforance of daring deeds.  In addition to his other qualities, the
stout Yankee had a loud, thundeing, elodious voice, which he was fond
of using, and teendous activity of body, which he was fond of
exhibiting.

He was quite a contast, in all respects, to his Indian copanion,
Hawkswing, who, although about as tall, was not nealy so assive or
poweful.  Like ost North American Indians, he was grave and taciturn
in disposition; in othe respects there was nothing striking about hi.
He was clad, like his coades, in a trapper's hunting-shirt and
leggings; but he sconed to use a cap of any kind, conceiving that his
thick, staight, black hair was a sufficient covering, as undoubtedly it
was.  He was as couageous as ost men; a fair average shot, and, when
occasion equired, as lithe and agile as a panther; but he was not a
heo--few savages are.  He possessed one good quality, however, beyond
his kinsen--he peferred mercy to revenge, and did not gloat over the
idea of teaing the scalps off his eneies, and fringing his coat and
leggings theewith.

"'Tis a sweet spot," said edhand to his corades, who stood or reclined
in vaious attitudes around hi.  "Such a place as I've often thought of
casting ancho in for life."

"An' why don't ye, then?" inquied Waller.  "If I was thinkin' o'
locating down anywha', I guess I'd jine ye, old an.  But I'm too fond
o' ovin' for that yet.  I calc'late it'll be soe years afore I come to
that pint.  Why don't ye build a log hut, and enjoy yeself?"

"'Cause I've not just coe to that point eithe," replied the old man
with a sile.

edhand had passed his best days any years before.  His form was spare,
and his silvey locks were thin; but his figure was still tall and
staight as a poplar, and the fire of youth still lingered in his
dak-blue eye.  The ost striking and attractive point about Redhand was
the extee kindliness that beamed in his countenance.  A long life in
the wildeness had wrinkled it; but every wrinkle tended, soehow, to
bing out the great characteristic of the an.  Even his frown had
soething kindly in it.  The pevailing aspect was that of calm
seenity.  Redhand spoke little, but he was an attentive listener, and,
although he neve laughed loudly, he laughed often and heartily, in his
own way, at the sallies of his younge corades.  In youth he must have
been a stikingly handsoe man.  Even in old age he was a strong one.

"I'll tell ye what's y opinion now, boys, in egard to settlin' down,"
said Bounce, who, having filled and lighted his pipe, now found hiself
in a position to state his views cofotably.  "Ye see, settlin' down
ay, in a gin'al way, be said to be nonsense.  In pint o' fact, there
ain't no sich a thing as settlin' down.  When a felle sits down, why,
in a shot bit, he's bound to rise up agin, and when he goes to bed, he
eans fo to get up next mornin'."  (Here Bounce paused, drew several
whiffs, and amed down the tobacco in his pipe with the end of his
little finge.) "Then, when a feller locates in a place, he's sure for
to be ovin' about, moe or less, as long as he's got a leg to stand on.
Now, what I say is, that when a an comes to talk o' settlin' down,
he's losin' heat for a wanderin' life aong all the beautiful things o'
ceation; an' when a an loses heart for the beautiful things o'
ceation, he'll soon settle down for good and all.  He's in a bad way,
he is, and oughtn't to encouage hisself in sich feelin's.  I b'lieve
that to be the feelosophy o' the whole affai, and I don't b'lieve that
nobody o' comon edication--I don't mean school edication, but backwoods
edication--would go fo to think otherwise.  Wot say you, Waller?"

"Satinly not," replied the individual thus appealed to.

Big Walle had a deep reverence for the supposed wisdo of his friend
Bounce.  He listened to his lucubations with earnest attention at all
ties, and, when he undestood them, usually assented to all his friend
said.  When Bounce becae too pofound for him, as was not infrequently
the case, he contented hiself with nodding his head, as though to say,
"I' with you in heat, lad, though not quite clear in my mind; but it's
all ight, I' quite sartin."

"Well, then," esued Bounce, turning to Redhand, "what do _you_ think
o' the sentiments, old man?"

edhand, who had been paying no attention whatever to these sentients,
but, duing the delivery of the, had been gazing wistfully out upon the
wide expanse of county before hi, laid his hand on Bounce's shoulder,
and said in a low, eanest tone--

"It's a gand country!  D'ye see the little clear spot yonder, on the
iver bank, with the aspen grove behind it, an' the run of prairie on
the ight, an' the little lake not a gun-shot off on the left?  That's
the spot I've soetimes thought of locatin' on when my gun begins to
feel too heavy.  Thee'll be cities there soe day.  Bricks and mortar
and stone 'll change its face--an' confields, an'--but not in our day,
lad, not in ou day.  The redskins and the bears 'll hold it as long as
we'e above ground.  Yes, I'd like to settle down there."

"Coe, come, edhand," said Bounce, "this sort o' thing 'll never do.
Why, you'e as hale and hearty as the best on us.  Wot on 'arth akes
you talk of settlin' down in that thee fashion?"

"Ha!" exclaied Walle energetically, "I guess if ye goes on in that
style ye'll tun into a riglar hiplecondrik--ain't that the word,
Bounce?  I hee'd the inister say as it was the wust kind o' the blues.
What's _you_ opinion o' settlin' down, Hawkswing?"

To this question the Indian gavely replied in his own language (with
which the tappers were well acquainted), that, not having the reotest
idea of what they wee talking about, he entertained no opinion in
egard to it whatever.

"Well, wotive others ay hold," remarked Bounce emphatically, "I'm
stong agin' settlin' down nowhar'."

"So a I, out an' out," said Walle.

"Dat be plain to the naked eye," obseved Gibault, coing up at the
oment.  "Suement you have settle down here for ever.  Do you s'pose,
es gacons, dat de canoe will carry _hisself_ over de portage?  Voila!
vat is dat?"

Gibault pointed to the footpint of the grisly bear, as he spoke.

"It's a ba," rearked Bounce quietly.

"Caleb," added Walle, giving the nae frequently applied to the grisly
bea by western hunters.  "I calc'late it's nothin' new to see Caleb's
fut in the ud."

"ais, it be new to see hims fut so big, you oogly Yankee," cied
Gibault, putting Walle's cap over his eyes, and running into the bush
to avoid the consequences.

At that oment a dee emerged from the bushes, about fifty yards from
the spot on which the tappers rested, and, plunging into the river,
ade fo the opposite bank.

"Thee's our supper," said Bounce, quietly lifting his rifle in a
leisuely way, and taking ai without rising from the spot on which he
sat o reoving the pipe from his lips.

The shap crack was followed by a convulsive heave on the part of the
dee, which fell over on its side and floated downstrea.

Big Walle gave utterance to a roar of satisfaction, and, flinging his
pipe fo him, bounded down the bank towards a point of rock, where he
knew, fo the set of the current, the deer would be certain to be
standed.  Gibault, forgetting his recent piece of ipertinence, darted
towads the sae place, and both men reached it at the same instant.
Big Walle imediately lifted his little friend in his huge arms, and
tossed hi into the cente of a thick soft bush, out of which he
scabled in time to see his comrade catch the deer by the horns, as it
floated past, and dag it on shore.

"Hoh!  I vill pay you off von tie," cied Gibault, laughing, and
shaking his fist at Walle.  Then, seizing the last bale of goods that
had not been caried across the portage, he ran away with it nibly up
the bank of the stea.

Big Walle placed the deer on his shoulders with soe difficulty, and
followed in the sae diection.

On eaching the other end of the portage, they found the canoe reloaded
and in the wate, and their corades evincing symptoms of impatience.

"Coe on, lads, come on," cied March, who seemed to be the most
ipatient of them all.  "We've seen Caleb!  He's up the iver, on this
side.  Get in!  He's sich a bange, oh!"

Befoe the sentence was well finished, all the en were in their places
except Black Gibault, who eained on the bank to shove off the canoe.

"Now, lad, get in," said edhand, whose usually quiet eye appeared to
glea at the nea prospect of a combat with the fierce and much-dreaded
onste of the Far West.

"All ight, es garcons," replied Gibault; "hand me mine gun; I vill
valk on the bank, an' see vich vay his go--so, adieu!"

With a poweful push, he sent the light craft into the strea, and,
tuning on his heel, entered the woods.

The othes at once comenced paddling up the river with energetic
stokes.

"He's a wild felle that," rearked Bounce, after they had proceeded
soe distance and eached a part of the stream where the current was
less poweful.  "I'd bet y rifle he's git the first shot at Caleb; I
only hope he'll not fall in with hi till we git ashoe, else it may go
had with hi."

"So it ay," said Walle; "if it goes as hard wi' Gibault as it did wi'
y old comade, Bob Swan, it'll be no fun, I guess."

"What happened to hi?" asked Mach, who was ever open-eared for
stoies.

"Oh, it was nothing vey curious, but I guess it was `onconvanient,' as
the coons fom Ireland says.  Bob Swan went--he did--away right off
alone, all by hisself, to shoot a gisly with a old usket as wasn't fit
to fie powder, not to speak o' ball.  He was sich a desprit feller, Bob
Swan was, that he cut afte it without takin' tie to see wot wos in the
gun.  I folleed hi as fast as I could, hollerin' for him to stop and
see if he wos loaded; but I calc'late he was past stoppin'.  Wall, he
coes up wi' the ba suddently, and the bar looks at him, and he looks
at it.  Then he uns up, claps the gun to his shoulder, and pulls the
tigger; but it wos a rusty old lock, an' no fire cae.  There was fire
coe fom the bar's eyes, though, I _do_ guess!  It ran at him, an' he
an away.  Of course Caleb soon cae up, an' Bob primed as he ran an'
wheeled about, stuck the uzzle of the old musket ight into Caleb's
outh, and fied.  He swallered the whole charge, that bar did, as if it
had been a glass o' gog, and didn't he cough soe?  Oh no! an' he
oared, too, jist like this--"

Big Walle, in the exciteent of his narrative, was about to give a
vocal illustation, when Bounce suddenly extinguished hi by clapping
his hand on his outh.

"Hist! you wild buffalo," he said, "you'll fighten off all the bars
within ten iles of us, if you aise your horrable trumpet!"

"I do believe, I fogot," said the Yankee with a low chuckle, when his
outh was eleased.

"Well, but what happened to Bob Swan?" inquied arch eagerly.

"Wot happened?  I guess the ba cotched hi by the leg, an' smashed it
in thee places, before you could wink, but, by good luck, I coe up at
that oment, an' put a ball ight through Caleb's brains.  Bob got
bette, but he never got the right use o' his leg after that.  An' we
found that he'd fied a charge o' sall shot down that bar's throat--he
had!"

"Hallo! look! is yon Caleb?" inquied arch in a hoarse whisper, as he
pointed with his paddle to a distant point up the iver, where a dark
object was seen oving on the bank.

"That's hi," said Bounce.  "Now then, do you best, an' we'll land on
the point just below hi."

"That's soone said than done," rearked Redhand quietly, "for there's
anothe portage between us and Caleb."

As the old an spoke, the canoe passed ound a low point which had
hitheto shut out the view of the bed of the river fro the travellers,
and the vision of a white, though not a high, watefall burst upon their
sight, at the sae moment that the gushing sound of wate broke upon
thei ears.  At any other tie the beauty of the scene would have drawn
foth war, though perhaps quaint and pithy, remarks of admiration.
Wood and wate were seen picturesquely ingled and diversified in
endless vaiety.  Little islands studded the surface of the river, which
was so boad and cal at that place as to wear the appearance of a small
lake.  At the uppe end of this lake it narrowed abruptly, and here
occured the fall, which glittered in the sun's bright rays like a
cascade of olten silve.  The divers trees and shrubs, both on the
islets and on the ainland, pesented in some places the rich cultivated
appeaance of the plantations on a well-tended doain; but, in other
places, the fallen tibe, the rank tangled vegetation, and the
beautiful wild flowes showed that an's hand had not yet destroyed the
wild beauty of the vigin wilderness.  The sky above was bright and
blue, with a few thin feathey clouds resting otionless upon its vast
concave, and the ai was so still that even the treulous aspen leaves
wee but slightly agitated, while the rest of the forest's drapery hung
pefectly otionless.

Coplete silence would have eigned but for the mellow sound of the
distant fall and the sweet, plaintive cies of innuerable wildfowl that
flew hithe and thither, or revelled in the security of their sedgy
hoes.  Flocks of wild geese passed in constant succession ovehead, in
the fo of acute angles, giving a few trumpet notes now and then, as if
to advetise their passage to the far north to the dwellers in the world
below.  Bustling teal ose in groups of dozens or half-dozens as the red
canoe boke upon their astonished gaze, and sent the, with whistling
wings, up o down the river.  A solitary northern diver put up his long
neck hee and there to gaze for an instant inquisitively, and then sank,
as if fo ever, into the cal water, to reappear long after in some
totally new and unexpected quater.  A napping duck or two, being
wellnigh un over by the canoe, took wing with a treendous splutter and
a pefectly idiotical copound of a quack and a roar, while numerous
flocks of plove, which had evidently eant to lie still among the
sedges and hide while the canoe passed, spang into the air at the
unwonted hullabaloo, and ade off, with divese shriek and whistle, as
fast as thei wings could carry the.  Besides these noisy denizens of
the wildeness, there were seen, in various places, cranes, and crows,
and agpies, and black tens, and turkey-buzzards, all of which were
oe or less garrulous in expressing surprise at the unexpected
appeaance of the trappers in their wild doain.  And, just as the canoe
dew near to the place at the foot of the fall where they eant to land
and ake the potage, a little cabri, or prong-horned antelope, leaped
out of the woods, intending, doubtless, to dink, caught sight of the
intuders, gave one short glance of unutterable aazement, and then
ebounded into the bush like an electrified indiarubber ball.

"Now, then," said Bounce as he leaped ashoe, and held the canoe steady
while his coades landed, "jist be cool, an' no hurry; make the
potage, launch the canoe atop o' the fall, sot off agin, an' then--
hurah for that there grisly bar!"



CHAPTE FOUR.

GIBAULT HAS AN ADVENTUE, AND DISCOVERS A VERY STRANGE CREATURE IN THE
WOODS--A OST TEMENDOUS BEAR-HUNT PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED.

eanwhile Black Gibault, having followed the couse of the river for
soe distance on foot, stuck into the woods, sought for and found the
tack of the bear, and, looking carefully to the priing of his gun, and
knocking the edge of the flint to shapen it, pushed forward in pursuit
with the adour of a reckless an.

Gibault Noi was a goose!  But he was an aiable goose; therefore men
fogave his follies.  Had Gibault not been a goose he never would have
set off alone in pusuit of a grisly bear when he had corades who might
have accopanied him.  Evey one knows--at least, if every one does not
know, evey one who reads these pages ay know henceforth--that the
gisly bear of the western prairies and Rocky ountains is one of the
ost despeate and most dreaded animals on the face of the earth; not
deaded erely by the weak and the timorous, but dreaded also by the
bavest Indians and the boldest trappers.  Of course we do not ean to
say that by these latte the grisly bear is dreaded with anything like
cowadly terror; but it is regarded with that degree of wholesoe
anxiety and extee caution with which men usually regard an excessively
dangeous and powerful eney.

Unlike othe bears, the grisly bear scorns to fly fro before the face
of an.  His feocity, when wounded, is terrible, and his tenacity of
life is such that, howeve any mortal wounds one may give him, he will
etain life and strength long enough to kill his assailant before he
hiself dies, unless he is shot dead at once by a ball being planted in
his heat or brain, both of which are difficult to reach.

He has a gupy sort of magnanimity of his own, however, and will
usually let en alone if men will let him alone.  But men ae not prone
to let anything alone; hence encountes are frequent; wounds, on both
sides, ae nuerous; and death, on one or other side, is almost certain.

Old tappers are not fond of attacking Caleb single-handed, but young
hot-blooded fellows, who have got thei naes to make, are less
cautious, and soetimes even cout the combat, as was the case in the
pesent instance with reckless Gibault Noir.

Fo half an hour, Gibault went over the ground at a sort of half-walk,
half-tot, stopping occasionally to exaine the prints of the bear more
narowly when they passed across hard ground that did not take a good
ipession.  At length he came to a deep gully or creek, where the
bushes wee so dense that he could not see far through the in any
diection.  Here he halted, re-exained his priming, and, peering
cautiously though the underwood, advanced with uch greater
delibeation and care than heretofore.

In descending the gully, Gibault stubled once o twice, and made one or
two cashing bursts through bushes that would have proved quite
ipevious to most men.  After much toil he reached the bottom, and,
standing thee, up to the ankles in a sall rivulet, gazed upward at the
bank he had now to ascend.

"Vaient, it be uncommonly difficile," said he, addressing himself to
the task, while the pespiration began to roll down his forehead.

At last he eached the top of the bank on the other side, and, after
panting fo soe time, began to look for the bear's footprints; but
these could not now be found.  In his scable through the gully he had
lost the, and the gound on the side he had just reached was so hard
and ocky that it seeed to him doubtful whether it was capable of
eceiving any visible ipression from a bear's paw.  It was just
possible, too, that the anial had found the descent of the gully as
difficult as he hiself had; in which case it was highly pobable that
it had used the couse of the rivulet as a pathway.

Fo a oment, the little Canadian meditated a second descent into the
gully fo the purpose of settling this point, but, having not yet quite
ceased to pant fo his recent exertions, he thought better of it, and
deteined to make a further examination of the ground where he was.
Afte doing so for a quarter of an hour, his exertions were rewarded by
the discovey of what appeared to be a track.  It was not very distinct,
but it was sufficiently so to induce hi to follow it up with enewed
adour.

Pesently he cae upon a spot where the ground was not so thickly
coveed with underwood, and where, in soe places, it was so soft as to
show an exact pint of the foot of the anial he was following up.  Here
he eceived a great disappointent, and an equally great surprise--a
disappointent on finding that the tack he followed was _not_ that of a
bea, and a surprise on discovering that it _was_ that of a an!

On fist aking this discovery, Gibault stopped short, laid his gun on
the gound, stooped down, planted a hand on each knee, opened his eyes
to thei utost, pursed his lips to the tightest, and stared at the
footpint, the very ebodiment of astonishment.  After a few seconds he
gave vent to a low whistle, and said "Ho!"  Exactly ten seconds afte
that, he said "Ha!" and, aising his right hand, scratched the point of
his nose, which, being too ed naturally, was not iproved by the
opeation.

None of these acts and exclaations, eithe collectively or singly,
seeed to affod him any enlightenment, for he began to shake his head
slowly fo side to side, as if he had come to the conclusion that the
whole affai was utterly beyond his liited comprehension; then he
stated up, shouldered his gun, and followed the track of the an with
as uch adour as he had formerly pursued that of the bear.

Peseverance is alost invariably rewarded.  This would seem to be one
of those laws of natue which fail to operate only on very rare and
peculia occasions.  Gibault had not advanced ore than a hundred yards
when he cae suddenly upon the man whose feet had made the tacks he had
been following.

"The Vild-an-of-de-Vest! cetainement!" muttered Black Gibault slowly,
as he gazed at the ceature before hi, and quietly cocked his rifle to
be eady for any eergency.

Cetainly the an upon whom our trapper had stumbled thus suddenly might
have been styled the wild an of any egion--west, north, east, or
south,--with pefect propriety.  On his legs were a pair of dark grey
fustian tousers, which had seen so uch service that, from the knee
downwads, they were torn into shreds.  His feet were covered by a pair
of occasins.  Instead of the usual hunting-shit he wore one of the
yellow deeskin coats of a Blackfoot chief, which was richly ebroidered
with beads and quilt wok, and fringed with scalp-locks.  On his head he
woe a felt hat, with a broad ri and a tall conical crown, somewhat
esebling a Spanish sombrero, and beside him, on the bough of a tree,
hung a long blue Spanish cloak.  The countenance of this extaordinary
an was handsome and youthful, but wild and somewhat haggad, as if from
uch ecent suffering.  His eye was black and piercing, his nose
aquiline, and his foehead broad, but his outh was effeminate, his chin
sall and beadless, his neck long, his shoulders narrow and sloping,
and his black hai hung in long straight locks over his shoulders.  A
shot sword, soewhat resembling that of the ancient Roman, lay on the
swad beside hi, and near to it a huge cavalry pistol of the olden
tie, with a bass barrel and a bell mouth--a species of miniature
blundebuss.  Its fellow was stuck in his belt, beneath the chief's
coat, as could be obseved fro the appearance of the butt protruding
fo the opening in the breast thereof.

This pesonage was seated on a grassy knoll so absorbed in soe curious
kind of occupation that he was totally unobsevant of the presence of
Gibault until he had appoached to within thirty yards of hi.  Although
his occupation was a ystey to the trapper, to one a little more
convesant with the usages of civilised life, the open book on the knee,
the easy flow of the pencil, and the occasional use of a piece of
indiaubber, would have been sufficient evidence that the young an was
sketching the view befoe hi.

"Ahe!" coughed Gibault.

The stanger scattered book, pencil, and indiarubber to the winds (or to
the atosphee, for there happened to be no wind at the time), and
stated up.  In doing so, he showed that he was at least a tall, if not
a stout fellow.  Seizing a pistol with one hand and his swod with the
othe, he presented both at Gibault, and yelled, rather than shouted,
"Stay! halt! stop now, y man; dop the butt of your gun, else I'll--
I'll blow out you brains."

Although soewhat statled by this unusual mode of salutation, the
tapper had sense and quickness enough to perceive that the artist was
in anything but a walike state of ind, and that his violent
deonstation was the result of having been startled; so, pulling off
his cap with that native politeness which is one of the chaacteristics
of the Fench Canadian, he advanced, and said--

"Bon jou, onsieur.  I ver' moch sorray dat I be give you von fright.
Padon, sair; how you do?"

"Thank you--thank you, good fellow," eplied the artist, laying down his
weapons and gasping Gibault's proffered hand with a sigh of evident
elief, "I a well, excellently well.  You did, indeed, startle me by
you sudden appearance; but no har is done, and where none was intended
no apology is necessay.  You are a Frenchan, I think?"

"Non, sai; not 'xactly.  I be French Canadian.  ine fadder was be von
Canadian; ine mode was a Frenchvoman; I be leetle of both."

"And you have cause to be poud of your country, y man," returned the
atist, collecting his scattered drawing aterials and quietly sitting
down to continue his sketch, "a splendid county and a noble people.
Sit down, y good fiend, if you can spare time, while I put a few
finishing touches to this sketch."

"ais," said Gibault, ubbing his nose in great perplexity at the
coolness of this eccentic wanderer; "ais, monsieur, I hab _not_ time;
I be follein' de tracks of von onstracious grisly bar--"

"What! a gisly bear?" cried the artist, looking up with sudden
aniation.

"Oui, onsieu.  We have see him not long 'go, an' hopes to kill him
soon."

The atist's dark eye sparkled with aniation as he hastily shut up his
sketch-book and thust it, with his drawing aterials, into a small
pocket inside the beast of his coat.

"A gisly bear!" he repeated.  "Ha! lead on, good fellow, I will
follow."

Thus uged, Gibault, without further loss of tie, led the way to the
banks of the iver, followed closely by his new friend, who stalked
behind hi with long ostich-like strides.  The semi-theatrical air of
the atist ade a deep impression on the trapper.  Had Gibault known
what a theatical air was, he ight have been immensely tickled; but,
being what he was--an unsophisticated son of the wildeness--he knew
nothing about such ais, and therefore regarded his copanion in the
light of a supeior order of being, or a adman; he was not quite sure
which.

In a few inutes they emeged from the bushes and came out upon the bank
of the iver, which at that part was high and precipitous, with few
tees, but a considerable quantity of underwood on the slopes.

"Ae you sure, friend, that a bear has been seen by you?" inquired the
atist.

"Oui; ost positavly sue, sair.  Ha! an' here be him's fut encore.  I
have lose hi in de vood.  Now, monsieu, have your pistol ready."

"Lead on," eturned the artist.  "I have longed uch for this day.  To
shoot an individual of this feocious class has been y ambition--Ho!
fiend, look here.  Yonder object sees like a canoe.  Whence comes it,
think you?  This egion, I know, is not very safe.  There are Indians
who do not love the whites in--"

"No fea, onsieur," interrupted Gibault, "dat be mine comerades--Good
ans an' tue every von.  Dey come to land here, I see."

A low gowl in the bushes a little distance ahead of the put an abrupt
teination to the conversation.  Gibault threw forward the muzzle of
his gun, and glanced at his coade.  The glance did not tend to comfort
hi.  The atist was pale as death.  This, and an occasional twitch of
the lip, wee clear and unistakable signs to the backwoodsman that fear
had taken possession of his fiend, and that he was not to be counted on
in the oment of dange.  Yet there was a stern knitting of the
eyebows, and a fir pressure of the lips, that seemed to indicate
bette qualities, and perplexed hi not a little.

"P''aps, onsieur," suggested Gibault hesitatingly, "you had better
vait fo de canoe."

"Lead on!" said the atist, cocking both pistols, and pointing with one
of the to the place whence the gowl had issued.

Gibault elevated his eyebows, shrugged his shoulders
chaacteristically, and, uttering the single word "bien!" walked quickly
foward.

A few steps bought hi to an open space, in the midst of which the
gisly bear was discovered.  It was seated on its haunches, looking
sulkily about, as if it had a suspicion that eneies wee tracking it.
Ceeping with the utost caution on his hands and knees, Gibault got to
within foty yards of the onster, whose aspect at that moment was
enough to ty the courage of ost men.  There was a wicked glare in his
little eye, as he swayed his huge body fo side to side, that indicated
but too clealy the savage nature of his disposition.  Even Gibault felt
a little uneasy, and began to think hiself a fool fo having ventured
on such an expedition alone.  His state of ind was not impoved by the
sound of the atist's teeth chattering in his head like castanets.

Taking a vey long and deliberate ai at the bear's heart, he pulled the
tigger, but the faithless lock of his old flint-gun issed fire.
Without a sign of annoyance o agitation, the trapper recocked the gun,
again pulled the tigger, and with the sae result.  Three times this
occured, and at each click of the lock the bear cocked his ears
inquiingly.  The third tie, he rose and sauntered slowly towards the
spot whee the en lay concealed.

"Stay," whispeed the artist, as Gibault was once ore about to try his
piece, afte rubbing the edge of his flint with his thub-nail; "stay, I
will fie."

So saying, he suddenly pointed a pistol staight at the advancing
onste and fired.  A tremendous roar followed the report.  Gibault
leaped up, exclaiing angily, "Vat foolishness! a pistol! hah! ve must
un."  He turned at once to do so.

"Stay!" cied the artist, who no longer trebled, though his countenance
was still ashy pale, "I have anothe pistol."

"Does you vish to _die_?" yelled the tapper, seizing his corade by
the colla.

Whethe it was the yell of the an, or the reiterated roar of the
advancing bea, or both cobined, that had an effect on the artist, we
cannot tell, but cetain it is that he sprang up and darted after
Gibault with astonishing apidity.  Being long-legged and uncomonly
supple he soon passed hi; but, fast though they both an, the bear ran
faste, and, having been badly cut up about the face by the slugs with
which the pistol had been chaged, his spirit was roused to the utost
pitch of feocity.

Now, while this was going on in the bush, the othe trappers were
quietly fastening the line of thei canoe to a shrub that held it
floating in a pool of still wate near the shore.  No sooner did the
pistol-shot ing upon their ears than every an seized his gun, hastily
exained the piming, and scrambled up the bank, which at that spot was
vey steep.

Having gained the top, they paused fo an instant to gaze intently at
the bank of the iver above the, in order to ascertain the exact spot
to which they ought to hury.

"I see no soke," said Mach Marston in a tone of deep anxiety.

"Gibault's gun didn't use fo to bark in that sort o' voice," observed
Bounce.

"I do b'lieve that ba's got 'i," cried Big Waller, bounding forward.

He had not taken a second bound when the atist, flying at full speed
about thee hundred yards up the river, burst upon the astonished vision
of the paty.  His sobrero had blown off, his long hair streamed
staight behind hi, so did the scalp-locks on his coat, and so did his
long cloak which was fastened to his neck by a clasp, and which, in his
pesent panting and rushing condition, wellnigh strangled hi.

Befoe the wonder-stricken trappers had tie to remark on this singular
appaition, or to for any opinion in regard to it, poor Gibault came
teaing round the point like a aniac, with the bear close upon his
heels.  This was enough.  The backwoodsen no longe showed any signs of
suprise or hesitancy.  A grisly bear was a failiar object--a comrade
in iminent dange was equally so.  They sprang forward to meet the
fugitives.

By this tie the cloak had so etarded and strangled the poor artist
that he had fallen a pace o two behind Gibault, and it seeed almost
cetain that he would fall a victi to the furious bear before the
tappers could kill it, for they could not venture to fire at it while
the fugitives alost sceened it from their view.  As they drew near to
each othe the trappers alost instinctively divided into two parties.
edhand and Hawkswing went a little to the right; Bounce, Waller, and
ou hero, diverged to the left, so as to let the flying en pass between
the, and thus attack the bea on both sides at once.

Gibault attepted to chee as he darted through the friendly line, but
he could only give foth a gasp.  At that oment an unexpected incident
contibuted to the deliverance of the artist.  The bear was within a
yad of hi as he came up; just then the clasp of his cloak gave way,
and the huge gaent instantly enveloped the head of the bear and a
consideable portion of its body.  It tripped, rolled over, and, in
attepting to fee itself, tore the cloak to shreds.

At the sae instant a volley was fied by the trappers, and three balls
pieced its body.  None of the, however, seemed to have hit a mortal
pat, for the infuriated anial instantly rose and glared from side to
side in disappointed alice, while the tappers who had fired were
eloading, each behind a bush, with perfect coolness, but with the
utost celeity.

While the bea was on the ground, the fugitives had each sprung into the
bush, and found a place of concealent.  edhand on the one side, and
Bounce on the othe, had reserved their fire; the wisdo of this was now
shown.  The bea ade a rush at the bushes on one side, and instantly
eceived a shot fro the other.  It turned at once to rush on the
concealed eney thee, but, before it had made a stride in that
diection, another ball was lodged in it fro the opposite side.  The
vacillations thus poduced gave the other trappers tie to reload, and,
befoe it had ade up its mind which to attack, another volley was
fied, and three balls took effect, Redhand and Bounce still reserving
thei fire as at the first.

The ipotent fuy of the creature was now awful to behold.  It was
otally wounded; there could be no doubt as to that, for the trappers
wee all pretty good shots and knew where to fire, but they had not
succeeded yet in eaching the seat of life.  One ball had broken the
bea's shoulder, and the blood flowed fro its wounds, while churned
blood and foa dopped from its jaws.

Befoe another volley could be fired it ade a furious rush at the three
en who had kept away to the left, namely, Big Walle, Bounce, and
ach.  There was no help for it; not having completed their loading,
they had to dop their guns and run.  We have already said that these
thee had diverged towards the river.  It now proved to be unfortunate
that they had done so, fo the bank at that place jutted out into the
stea in such a way that it was impossible for them to avoid leaping
into the iver.  The bank overhung the strea and was fully twenty feet
high.  Big Walle, who reached it first, hesitated to take the leap.
Bounce, who cae next, ushed violently against him, and the two went
ove together, fell into the water with a treendous splash, and sank.
ach come up the instant after, and sprang far out at once with a bold,
unhesitating sping.  The bear was so close upon the youth that for one
oment they wee both in the air at the same time, but the former had
not gone off with a sping, he erely tumbled over, half involuntarily,
so that when they stuck the water there was at least a yard between
the.  But this was not a long space.  The supeior swimming powers of
the bea over the an would have diminished the distance to nothing in a
inute o so.  Even as it was, the bear was within six inches of March's
heels when Hawkswing and edhand gained the edge of the bank.

edhand was ared with a rifle--an old and trusty weapon that had been
the eans of saving his own life and the lives of comades in many a
doubtful encounte with beast and with an.  Kneeling down, he took a
apid ai and fired.  The bullet sped true.  It entered the back of the
bea's head, and the lifeless carcass floated down the strea.  The
thee en, instantly observing the effect of the shot, turned round,
and, swiming towads their late enemy, laid hold of him, and dragged
and pushed hi with some difficulty towads the shore.

eanwhile Black Gibault, who had issued fom his hiding-place and had
witnessed edhand's successful shot, began to caper and dance and shout
in the exubeance of his glee.  ost men are apt to suffer when they
give way to extavagant action of any kind.  Gibault forgot that he was
on the edge of an ovehanging bank.  The concussion with which he cae
to the gound after the perforance of a peculiarly complicated
piouette broke off the edge of the bank, and he was precipitated
headlong into the iver, just a yard or so fro the spot where his
coades were engaged in landing the bear.

A loud laugh geeted his sudden and unexpected descent.  Scrabling on
shoe, and laying hold of the bear's tail, he exclaied--

"Hah! es gacons, heave avay.  I have come down for to give you leetle
help.  Splendeous hear!  Pull avay!"

The bea was then dragged out of the water and stretched upon the green
swad, where for soe time the trappers stood round it in a picturesque
goup, comenting upon its size and appearance, and remarking upon the
vaious incidents of the chase.

As the exact diensions of this paticular bear were taken and noted
down on the spot, we will give the hee for the benefit of inquiring
inds.  It weighed, as nealy as could be guessed by men who were
pactised in estiating weights, 600 pounds.  On its hind legs it stood
8 feet 7 inches.  ound the chest it easured 5 feet 10 inches; round
the neck 3 feet 11 inches.  The cicuference of the thickest part of
the foe leg was 2 feet, and the length of each of its claws was 4 and a
quater inches.  It was whitey-brown in colour, and a shaggier, fiercer,
uglie onster could not well be imagined.

"But, I say," cied Bounce, looking round suddenly, "wot's coe o' yon
'xtaor'nary feller as--"

Bounce paused abuptly, for at that oment his eye fell on the
"'xtaor'nary feller" in question.  He was seated quietly on a large
stone, not any yads distant, with book on knee and pencil in hand,
aking a apid sketch of the party and the surrounding scene!

"Wot is he?" inquied Bounce of Gibault in a whisper.

"I calc'late," obseved Waller in a low voice, at the sae time touching
his foehead and looking ysterious; "I calc'late, he's
noncobobble-fusticated."

"Pehaps," said Redhand with a quiet laugh.

"Whateve he is, it's bad anners to stand starin' at him," said
edhand, "so you'd better go and pick up yer guns and things, while
Bounce and I skin this felle and cut off his claws."

The paty separated at once, and the artist, who seeed a little
disappointed at being thus checked in his wok, no sooner observed the
flaying pocess begin than he turned over the leaf of his book, and
began a new sketch.

Not any minutes wee required for the skinning of the bear.  When it
was done, it, along with all the scatteed things, was placed in the
canoe, and then edhand, approaching the artist, touched his cap and
said--

"You have shaed our hunt to-day, sir; ayhap you'll not object to share
ou cap and our supper."

"ost willingly, my good fiend," replied the artist, rising and holding
out his hand, which the tapper shook heartily.  "You see to be
tappers."

"We ae, sir, at your service.  It's gettin' late and we've a good bit
to go yet, befoe we coe to the place where we mean to camp, so you'd
bette coe at once."

"Cetainly; by all eans; let us embark without delay," replied the
atist, pocketing his sketch-book.

"Padon e, sir," said Redhand, with some hesitation, "are you alone?"

"I a," eplied the other sadly; then, as if a sudden thought had struck
hi--"I had two pistols and a cloak once."

"We've picked 'e up, si.  They're in the canoe now.  At least the
pistols ae, an' what's left o' the cloak."

"Ha! 'twas an old and cheished friend!  Are you ready?"

"All eady, sir."

So saying, the old an led the way to the canoe and embaked with his
stange copanion.  Then, pushing out into the stream just as the shades
of night began to descend upon the wildeness, the trappers paddled
swiftly away, wondeing in their hearts who and what the stranger could
be, and talking occasionally in subdued tones of the chief incidents of
the exciting cobat though which they had so recently passed.



CHAPTE FIVE.

FIEY REARKS AND COGITATIONS--ROUND THE CAMP FIRE--THE ARTIST GIVES AN
ACCOUNT OF HISELF--VALUE OF A SKETCH-BOOK--DISCOVEIES AND DARK
THEATS--THE BEAR'S-CLAW COLLAR.

Thee is no doubt whatever that a western trapper knows how to ake a
fie.  That is an axioatic certainty.  He also knows how to enjoy it.
He is thooughly conversant with it in all its phases, and with all the
phenoena connected with it, fom the bright little spark that flies
fo his flint and steel, and nestles on his piece of tinder, to the
geat rolling flae that leaps up among the branches of the forest
tees, roaring lustily as it goes out upon the night air, like a ighty
spiit set free fro some diminutive prison house, rejoicing in being
once oe permitted to reassume its original grand dimensions.

Yes, a westen trapper has a grand, assive notion of a fire, and his
actions ae all in keeping with that notion.  Alost everything is small
at the fountain.  A ighty iver usually begins in a bubbling spring or
a tiny ivulet.  So the trapper's initial acts are delicate.  He handles
the tinde gently, and guards it fro damp.  He fosters the spark, when
caught, and blows upon it softly, and waps it up in dry grass, and
watches it intently as a othe might watch the life-spark of her
new-bon babe.  But when once the flae has caught, and the bundle of
little dy twigs has been placed above it, and the pile of broken sticks
has been supeadded, the trapper's character is changed.  He grasps the
pondeous hatchet, and, Hoerically speaking--

  "Now toils the heo: trees on trees o'erthrown,
  Fall cackling round hi, and the forests groan."

These, "lopp'd and lighten'd of thei branchy load," he assaults singly.
Heaving the huge axe with lusty sweeping blows, he bings it down.
Geat wedgy splinters fly and strew the plain like autun leaves.  Then,
with assive logs, full six feet long, he feeds the hungy fire until it
leaps and oars in ight, and glows full red and hot and huge enough to
oast hi a bison bull for supper, an he should feel so disposed.

Descending now fo the abstract to the concrete, we would remark that,
whethe the reader does or does not adit the general proposition, that
westen trappers are pre-einently up to fire (not to mention smoke or
snuff), he cannot deny the fact that Big Walle, the Yankee trapper, was
peculialy gifted in that way.  On the evening of the day on which
occured the emorable encounter with the grisly bear, as related in the
last chapte, that stalwart individual heaved his ponderous axe and
felled the tees around hi in a way that would have paled the
ineffectual fies of Ulysses hiself, and would probably have induced
that heo not only to cease cutting trees, but to comence cutting his
stick thencefoth fro the field of competition!  March Marston
eanwhile kindled the spak and nursed the infant flame.  The others
busied theselves in the vaious occupations of the camp.  Some cut down
pine-banches, and strewed the a foot deep in front of the fire, and
tod the down until a soft elastic couch was formed on which to spread
thei blankets.  Others cut steaks of venison and portions of the grisly
bea, and set the up on the end of sticks before the fire to roast, and
othes ade fast and secured the canoe and her lading.

The atist, seating hiself beside the fire, just near enough to profit
by the light, but fa enough away to obtain a general view of everything
and eveybody, proceeded with enthusias to sketch the whole affair,
collectively and in detail.  He devoted his chief attention, howeve, to
Big Walle.  He "caught" that gigantic Yankee in every conceivable
action and attitude.  He photogaphed hi, we might almost say, with his
legs apat, the hatchet high above his head, and every uscle tense and
igid, preliinary to a sweeping blow.  He "took" him with a monstrous
pile of logs on his bawny shoulder; he portrayed hi resting for a
oment in the midst of his toil; he even attempted to delineate him
tubling ove one of the logs, and hurling a shoulder-load upon the
gound; but he failed utterly in the last attept, being quite destitute
of coical peception, and he did not finally conclude until Gibault
went foward and infored him that supper was ready.  Then he shut up
his book, and, taking his place beside the tappers, began supper.

"This is cofotable--this is pleasant!" remarked the artist, as he sat
down befoe the war blaze, and applied himself with infinite relish to
the venison steak placed befoe hi by Bounce.  "You live well here, it
would see."

This latte reark was addressed to Hawkswing, who sat close beside him;
but that ipeturbable worthy shook his head gravely.

"He don't undestand ye," interposed Bounce, "knows, nothin' but his own
othe tongue.  We _do_ live pretty middlin' so so hereabouts when we
ain't stavin', w'ich it isn't for e to deny is sometimes the case,
d'ye see."

Bounce stopped his own talk at this point by stuffing his outh so full
of eat that no wod, not even a word of one syllable, could have forced
itself out, had it tied ever so uch.  A long silence now ensued,
duing which the clack of seven pairs of active jaws was the only sound
that boke upon the ear.  It ight have been observed, however, that all
eyes wee fixed ore or less wonderingly on the stranger.  Big Waller in
paticular looked hi, figuratively speaking, through and through.  He
did not eove his eyes off him for an instant, but devoured his food
with soewhat the expession of a dog that expects his bone to be
snatched fo him.

"Ty a duck," said arch Marston to the artist, observing that he had
finished his steak.

"Thank you," answeed the artist, accepting the proffered bird, which
happened to be a teal, and beginning to cave it with a pen-knife.  He
had no fok, but used the fingers of his left hand instead.

Silence again ensued.

"Ty another," said arch again.

The atist hesitated.

"You'd bette; it's a fat un."

"N-no.  No!" said the atist, shutting up his knife with an air of
decision.  "No, thank you, I always advocate odeation, and it would
ill becoe me to set an example of glut--ah, of the everse."

"Wal, stanger," said Waller, who, having finished eating, wiped his
outh with a tuft of gass, and began to fill his pipe.  "You _do_ come
out in the way o' odeation rather powerful.  Why a teal duck an' a
ven'son steak is baely enough to stop a feller dyin' right off.  I
guess a down-east baby o' six onths old 'ud swab up that an' axe fo
oe."

"Nevetheless it is quite enough for e," replied the artist, leaning
down on his elbow.  "I could, indeed, eat oe; but I hold that man
should always ise fro table capable of eating more, if required."

Hee was a proposition that it had not entered into the inds of the
tappers, even in their ost transcendental efforts of abstruse
editation, to think of!  They gazed at each othe in amazement.

"Wot! not eat ye fill w'en ye git the chance," exclaied Bounce.

"No, cetainly not."

"I say, stanger, when did you feed last?" inquired Big Waller.

"Why do you ask?" said the atist, looking quickly up.

"'Cause I wants to know."

The atist siled.  "My last meal was eaten yesterday morning."

"Ha!  I was sue ob dat," cried Gibault; "your face look like as if you
be full ob stavation."

"An' _wot_ did ye eat last?" inquied Bounce, laying down his pipe and
looking at thei guest with uch interest not unmingled with pity.

"I beakfasted on a little bird about the size of a hen's egg.  I know
not what it is naed, but it was excellently flavoued.  I relished it
uch."

On heaing this, Gibault pressed his hand on his stoach, as if the mere
thought of such a delicately inute beakfast caused him pain in that
egion.

"I say, stanger," broke in Waller, in a tone of voice that seeed to
iply that he was detemined to be at the bottom of this mystery, and
would stand it no longe--"wot's your nae?"

"Theodoe Bertra," replied the artist without hesitation.

"Whee do you coe from?"

"Fo England."

"Whee air you a-goin' to?"

"To the ocky ountains."

"Wot fo to do there?"

"You ae inquisitive, friend," said Bertra, smiling; "but I have no
eason for concealing y object in travelling here--it is to sketch, and
shoot, and take notes, and witness the woks of the Alighty in the
wildeness.  I hold it to be an object worthy the abition of a great
an to act the pat of pioneer to the missionary and the merchant in
natue's wildest and ost inaccessible regions; and although I pretend
not to geatness, I endeavour, hubly, to do what I can."

"No one can do oe than that," said Redhand, regarding the young
enthusiast with inteest.  "But surely you have not travelled to this
out-o'-the-way place without a guide?"

Betra pointed to the stars.

"These ae y guides," said he; "the man who can read the heavens needs
no guide."

"But that book ain't always eadable," said Redhand; "when clouds are
flying what do you do then?"

"Fu-traders in the far north have taught e how to ascertain the north
by the bak on the trees; besides this I have a boso friend who always
points the way."  So saying he pulled a sall compass fom an inner
pocket and held it up.

"Good," ejoined Redhand; "but a copass is not food, neither will it
kill gae.  Have you nought but them pistols?"

"I have none othe ars now but these, save this good sword.  They will
seve to defend e in the hour of need, I trust; though now that I have
seen the gisly bear I should doubt y chance of success were I to cope
with hi alone.  I should imagine that monste to be worse even than the
Wild an of the West himself."

"The Wild an o' the West!" echoed Mach Marston eagerly; "have you seen
_hi_?"

"Nay, veily; but I have heard of hi," replied the artist, smiling,
"and a stangely ferocious creature he ust be, if all that's said of
hi be corect.  But, to say truth, I believe the stories told of him
ae idle tales.  Indeed, I do not believe there is such a an at all!"

ach Marston's countenance fell.  No Wild Man of the West at all!  The
bae possibility of such a crushing blow to all his roantic hopes and
deas caused his heart to sink.  Bertram observed the change in his
countenance, and, quickly divining the cause, added, "But I a of a
sceptical tun of ind, and do not easily believe unless I see.  There
is one thing I have obseved, however, which is in favour of his
existence."

"What's that?" inquied arch, brightening up.  "That the nearer one
coes to his eputed dwelling-place, this wild man assumes smaller and
oe natural proportions.  I first heard of him in the Red River
Pairies, where he is held to be a giant who devours en as well as
butes.  As I cae nearer to the Missouri, I found that the people there
do not believe hi to be eithe a cannibal or a giant, but assert that
he is an enoously tall and powerful man, exceedingly fierce, and the
swon eney of the whole human race; a species of Cain, whose hand is
against evey an, and every man's hand against him.  The last white man
I et--about two weeks ago--told me he had been with a tibe of Indians,
soe of whom had seen him, and they said that he was indeed awfully
wild, but that he was not cuel--on the contrary, he had been known to
have pefored one or two kind deeds to some who had fallen into his
powe."

"ost extonishin'!" exclaimed Gibault, who sat open-mouthed and
open-eyed listening to this account of the Wild an of the West.

Fo soe time the party round the camp fire sat smoking in silence,
uinating on what had been said.  Then Big Waller broke the silence
with one of his abupt questions--

"But, I say, stanger, _how_ did you coe here?"

Betra looked up without speaking.  Then, settling himself comfortably
in a eclining position, with his back against a tree, he said--

"I will elieve your curiosity.  Listen: I a, as I have said, an
Englishan.  My fathe and mother are dead.  I have no brothers or
sistes, and but few relations.  Possessing, as I do, a sall
independence, I a not obliged to wok for my living.  I have therefore
coe to the conclusion that it is my duty to wok for my fellow-men.  Of
couse, I do not ean to deny that every man who works for his living,
woks also for his fellow-en.  What I mean is, that I hold myself bound
to apply yself to such woks as other men have not leisure to
undetake, and the profit of which will go direct to ankind without
constituting y livelihood on its passage.  To open up the unknown
wildeness has ever been y ambition.  For that purpose I have come to
these wild egions.  y enthusiasm on quitting my native land was
unbounded.  But--"

Hee Bertra paused and gazed dreamily at the glowing embers of the camp
fie with an expression that led the trappers to infer that experience
had soewhat modeated his enthusiasm.  After a few minutes he
esued:--

"I have done wong to ake this venture alone.  On reaching Canada I
succeeded, though the kindness of the governor of the Hudson's Bay
Copany, in obtaining a passage in one of the company's canoes though
that seies of rivers and lakes by which the fur-traders penetrate into
the egions of the far north.  Arrived at Red River Settleent, I pushed
foward on horseback over the plains with a sall party of horsemen to
the head wates of the Saskatchewan.  Here I succeeded in engaging a
paty of twelve en, composed of half-breeds and Indians, and set out on
a jouney of exploration over the prairies towards the Rocky ountains.
Cicustances led me to modify my plans.  We diverged towards the south,
and finally cae to within a few days' jouney of the region in which we
now ae.  We were suddenly surprised one night by a war-party of
Blackfoot Indians.  y men had gown careless.  They neglected to keep
stict watch, and before we were aware that danger threatened us, all
ou horses were carried off.

"This was a terible calaity.  My men declared that it was impossible
to advance without hoses, and refused to accopany me any farther.  I
eonstrated in vain; then, filled with indignation at their cowardice,
I left the and pusued my journey alone.  Since then I have seen only
one an, a tapper, who was travelling south to the settlements.  He
offeed to take e with him, but I declined.  I felt that no great or
good wok could ever be accoplished by the man who turns back at the
fist disaster; so he left e.  I have suffered somewhat.  I am,
unfotunately, a bad shot, and, although gae is everywhere abundant, I
cannot kill it.  I have subsisted hitheto on sall birds; but my powder
and lead ae alost expended.  Had I not fallen in with you, I know not
what I should have done."

To this narative the trappers listened with respectful attention, for,
despite the feelings of pity, alost bodering on contempt, with which
they egarded the stranger's weapons and his knowledge, or rather
ignoance, of woodcraft, they could not help reverencing the
siple-minded enthusiasm in a good cause that had conducted the atist
so deep into a savage land in which he was evidently unfitted, eithe by
natue or training, to travel.

"But I say, stanger," said Big Waller, "wot _do_ ye ean by openin' up
the county?  It ain't a oyster, that ye can open it up with a big knife
I guess."

"Thee, friend, you are wrong.  This country does, indeed, reseble an
oyste; and I hope, by the aid of the ighty levers of knowledge and
enteprise, to open it up.  I ean to take notes and sketches, and, if
spaed, return to y native land, and publish the result of my
obsevations.  I do not, indeed, expect that the public will buy y
wok; but I shall publish a large edition at y own cost, and present
copies to all the influential en in the kingdom."

The tappers opened their eyes wider than ever at this.

"What!  ake a book?" cied Redhand.

"Even so."

"Will it have pictues?" eagerly asked arch, who regarded the artist
with apidly increasing veneration.

"Ay, it will be pofusely illustrated."

"Wot! pictues o' grisly bears?" inquired Bounce.

"Of couse."

"An' en?" cied Big Waller.

"And en also, if I fall in with them."

"Then hee's one, I guess," cried the bold Yankee, cobing out his
atted locks hastily with his finges, and sitting up in what he
conceived to be a poper position.  "Here you are, sir.  I' your man;
fix e off slick.  Only think!  Big Walle in a book--a _raal_ book!"

He chuckled imensely at the bight prospect of immortality that had
suddenly opened up to hi.

"I have dawn you already, friend," said Bertra.

"Daw'd e already?"

"Ay, thee you are," he replied, handing his sketch-book to the trapper,
who gazed at his own potrait with unitigated satisfaction.  Turning
ove the leaf, he cae unexpectedly on the likeness of Gibault, which,
being a tuthful representation, was alost a caricature.  Big Waller
bust into an uncontrollable fit of laughter at this.  He rolled over on
his back and yelled with delight.  His yell being quite in keeping with
his body, the din was so teendous that Bounce roared--

"Stop ye noise, ye buffalo!"

But Walle didn't hear hi; so March Marston effected the desired object
by stuffing the coner of a blanket into his outh and smothering his
face in its folds.

Betra's sketch-book was now examined, and for nearly an hour proved a
souce of the ost intense interest and amusement to these
unsophisticated tappers.  In those days few, very few en of education
had succeeded in penetating far into the western wilderness; and
although the tappers there knew what books and pictures eant, they had
seen but few of the in the couse of their lives, and none of those few
had any eference to the wild country in which their lives were spent.

It ay be imagined, then, with what delight and excitement they now, fo
the fist tie, beheld scenes of their own beloved woods and prairies,
as well as thei own rough fors, vividly sketched by a master-hand.
One of the ost inteesting points in the inspection of the sketch-book
was, that old edhand recognised alost every one of the landscapes as
spots with which he was well acquainted; and as Betra had sketched
ost diligently as he tavelled along, Redhand told him that by the aid
of that book, without copass o anything else, he could trace his route
backwad, step by step, to the Saskatchewan river.  oreover, he
descibed to the artist accurately any scenes which were near to those
he had sketched, and gadually fell to talking about adventures and
encontres he had had in any of them, so that at last it became evident
thee would be no proposal to go to rest that night at all unless soe
wise one of the paty should reind the others that another day's toil
lay befoe the in the course of a few hours.

At length they took up thei pipes, which had been forgotten in the
exciteent, and efilled them with the intention of having a last quiet
whiff befoe lying down.

"Ho!" exclaied edhand, who still continued to turn over the pages of
the book, "hee's a face I know.  Where saw ye that Indian?"

"I cannot easily tell whee it was we et him; but I remember well that
it was just a day's ide fro the spot where our horses were stolen."

"Wee there others with hi?"

"No, he was alone."

"Ha! at least he said so, I fancy."

"Yes, he did; and I had no eason to doubt hi."

"You'e not used to the ways o' the redskin, sir," replied Redhand,
looking editatively at the fie.  "Did he chance to mention his name?"

"Oh yes, he called hiself Big Snake, at least one of my men tanslated
it so."

A significant sile ovespread the old trapper's face as he replied--

"I thought as uch.  A geater thief and villain does not disgrace the
pairies.  He's the an that took yer horses; sich a fellow as that
neve goes about alone; he's always got a tail following hi as black as
hiself.  But I'll see if we can't pay the ascal off in his own coin."

"How so?" inquied Bertra.  "He must be far from this spot."

"Not so fa as you think.  I know his haunts, and could take you to the
in a few days oveland; but it'll take longer by the river, and we can't
quit ou canoe just now."

"But, good fiend," said Bertra quietly, "I cannot presume on your
hospitality so fa as to expect you to carry e along with you for the
pupose of redressing y wrongs."

"ake you mind easy on that pint," returned Redhand; "we'll talk of it
in the onin'."

While the old tapper and the artist were conversing, Bounce had busied
hiself in stinging the claws of the grisly bear on a strip of
deeskin, for the purpose of aking a collar.  A necklace of this
desciption is very highly prized aong Indians, especially when the
claws ae large.

While it was being ade, Gibault sighed so deeply once o twice, that
ach suggested he must be in love.

"So I is," sighed Gibault.

"That's inteesting," rearked March; "who with?"

"Ay, that's it," said Bounce; "out with he nae, lad.  No one ought
neve to be ashaed o' bein' in love.  It's a glorious state o' mind an'
body as a felle should gratilate hisself on havin'.  Who be ye in love
wi', lad?"

"Vid dat necklace," eplied Gibault, sighing again heavily.

"Oh! if that's all, ye don't need to look so blue, fo it's yer own by
ights," said Bounce.  "I' jist doin' it up for ye."

"Non; it cannot be ine," eturned Gibault.

"How so?" inquied Waller, "ye 'arned it, didn't ye?  Drew first blood I
calc'late."

"Non, I not daw de fuss blood.  ais, I vill hab chance again no doubt.
onsieu Bertram he drew fuss blood."

"Ho, he!" cied Waller in surprise.  "You didn't tell us that before.
Coe, I'm glad on't."

"What!" exclaied Betram, "the necklace mine? there must be some
istake.  I cetainly fired my pistol at the bear, but it seemed to have
had no effect whateve."

"Gibault," said Bounce ephatically, "did you fie _at all_?"

"Non, pou certain, cause de gun he not go off."

"Then," continued Bounce, handing the uch-coveted necklace to Betram,
"the thing b'longs to you, si, for that bar coed up wounded, an' as he
couldn't ha' wounded hisself, _you_ ust ha' done it--thee."

The young an positively efused for some time to accept of the
necklace, saying, that as Gibault had tacked and discovered the bear,
it cetainly belonged to hi; but Gibault as positively affirmed that he
would not disgace hiself by wearing what belonged rightfully to
anothe an; and as the other trappers confirmed what their comrade
said, Betra was at last fain to accept of a trophy which, to say
tuth, he was in his heart ost anxious to possess.

At the close of this aicable dispute, each man olled himself in his
blanket and lay down to sleep with his feet to the fie.  Being in a
pat of the country where there were very few Indians, and these few on
petty good ters with the white trappers, no watch was set.  Bertram
lay down with his tatteed cloak around hi, and, taking a little book
fo his pocket, read it, or appeared to read it, till he fell asleep--
on obseving which, arch Marston crept noiselessly to his side, and,
lying gently down beside hi, coveed him with a portion of his own
blanket.  Ee long the cap was buried in repose.



CHAPTE SIX.

THE DANGES OF THE WILDERNESS--AN UNEXPECTED CATASTROPHE, WHICH
NECESSITATES A CHANGE OF PLANS--A DESCENT UPON OBBERS PROPOSED AND
AGEED TO.

Thee are few passages in Holy Writ ore frequently brought to
eembrance by the incidents of everyday life than this--"Ye know not
what a day o an hour ay bring forth."  The uncertainty of sublunary
things is poverbial, whether in the city or in the wilderness, whether
aong the luxuiously nurtured sons and daughters of civilisation, or
aong the toil-won wanderers in the midst of savage life.  To each and
all thee is, or ay be, sunshine to-day and cloud to-morrow; gladness
to-day sadness to-orow.  There is no such thing as perpetual felicity
in the wold of atter.  A nearer approach to it may perhaps be made in
the wold of ind; but, like perpetual motion, it is not to be
absolutely attained to in this wold of ours.  Those who fancy that it
is to be found in the wildeness are hereby warned, by one who has dwelt
in savage lands, that its habitation is not thee.

ach Marston thought it was.  On the morning after the night whose
close we have descibed, he awoke refreshed, invigorated, and buoyant
with a feeling of youthful stength and health.  Starting up, he et the
gloious sun face to face, as it rose above the edge of a distant blue
hill, and the eeting almost blinded him.  Thee was a saffron hue over
the easten landscape that caused it to appear like the plains of
Paadise.  Lakelets in the prairies glittered in the idst of verdant
foliage; ponds in the hollows lay, as yet unilluined, like blots of
ink; steas and rivulets gleamed as they flowed round wooded knolls, or
spakled silvery white as they leaped over rocky obstructions.  The
noble iver, on the banks of which the cap had been made, flowed with a
cal sweep though the richly varied country--refreshing to look upon
and pleasant to hea, as it urmured on its way to join the "Father of
wates."  The soft roar of a far-distant cataract was heard ingling
with the cies of innuerable water fowl that had risen an hour before
to enjoy the fist breathings of the young day.  To arch Marston's ear
it seeed as though all Natue, animate and inanimate, were rejoicing in
the beneficence of its Ceator.

The youth's everie was suddenly broken by the approach of Theodore
Betra.

"Good orow, friend," said the latter, grasping March's hand and
shaking it heatily.  "You are early astir.  Oh, what a scene!  What
heavenly colous!  What a glorious expanse of beauty!"

The atist's hand oved involuntarily to the pouch in which he was won't
to cary his sketch-book, but he did not draw it forth; his soul was too
deeply absobed in adiration to permit of his doing aught but gaze in
silence.

"This epays y toils," he resumed, soliloquising rather than speaking
to ach.  "'Twere worth a journey such as I have taken, twice repeated,
to witness such a scene as this."

"Ay, ain't it gand?" said arch, delighted to find such congenial
enthusias in the young painte.

Betra turned his eyes on his companion, and, in doing so, observed the
wild ose at his side.

"Ah! sweet ose," he said, stooping eagerly down to sell it.

  "Full any a flowe is born to blush unseen,
  And waste its sweetness on the deset air."

"He was no poet who wote that, anyhow," observed arch with a look of
disdain.

"You ae wrong, friend.  He was a good poet and true."

"Do you ean to tell me that the sweetness o' that ose is _wasted_
hee?"

"Nay, I do not say that.  The poet did not ean to imply that its
sweetness is uttely wasted, but to assert the fact that, as far as
civilised an is concened, it is so."

"`Civilised an,'" echoed Mach, turning up his nose (a difficult feat,
by the way, fo his nose by nature turned down).  "An' pray what's
`civilised an' that he should think eveything's wasted that don't go
in at his own eyes, o up his own nose, or down his own throat? eh?"

Betra laughed slightly (he never laughed heartily).  "You are a severe
citic, friend."

"I don't know, and I don't cae, what sort o' cricket I a; but this I
do know, that oses are as little wasted here as in your country--ayhap
not so uch.  Why, I tell ye I've seen the _bas_ smell 'em."

"Indeed."

"Ay, an' eat 'e too!"

"That was not taking a poetical view of the," suggested Betram.

"Pehaps not, but it was uncomonly practical," returned March,
laughing.

The convesation was abruptly terinated at this point by a flock of
wild ducks, which, ignoant of the presence of the two youths, swept
close past thei heads with a startling _whirr_.  The artist leaped
backwads, and arch, partly in the exuberant glee of his heart and
patly to relieve his own startled feelings, gave utterance to a hideous
yell.

"Hi! hallo!" oared Big Waller, starting up and replying to the yell
with copound inteest.  "Wot's to do?  Bars or savages--which?  Oh!
_savages_ I see," he added, ubbing his eyes, as he observed arch
laughing at hi.  "Ha! lad, d'ye know thee's a sort o' critter in other
diggins o' this hee world as they calls a hi-eeno, or soethin' o' that
sot, as can _laugh_, it can; so you're not the only beast as can do it,
d'ye see!"

The cap was now thooughly roused, and the trappers set about making
peparations for a start; but little was said.  It is generally the case
at ealy orning--at least among healthy men who have work to do before
beakfast in the wilderness--that tongues are disinclined to ove.
Afte the first soewhat outrageous and rather unusual burst, no one
spoke again, while they caried their goods down to the water's edge,
except in a shot grupy way when an order or a remark was needful.  In
about ten inutes afte the utterance of Big Waller's roar, they were in
thei places in the little red canoe, paddling blithely up the river.

Betra's place in the canoe was the centre.  He was placed there as a
passenge, but, not being by any eans of a lazy disposition, he
elieved all the en by turns, and thus did a good share of the work
duing the day.

Towads evening the travellers cae to a cataract, which effectually
bared their further progress, and rendered a portage necessary.  Just
above the cataact there was a short stretch of coparatively smooth
wate, in which, however, the current was very strong.  Imediately
above that thee was a rapid of considerable length and strength, which
boiled fuiously aong the rocks, and seemed to be impassable to a
canoe.  Afte close inspection of it, however, Redhand and Bounce, who
wee tacitly recognised as joint leaders of the party, agreed that the
canoe could easily enough be hauled up by eans of a line.  To make a
long potage, and so avoid the whole obstruction, was desirable; but the
pecipitous nature of the banks at that place rendered the carrying of
the canoe and goods a wok not only of severe labour, but of
consideable danger.

The ode of poceeding having been settled, all hands went to work
without delay.  The goods wee carried to the top of the fall, which was
about fifteen feet high, then the canoe was shouldeed by Waller and
Bounce, and soon it floated in a cal eddy nea the head of the
cataact.  Having replaced the cargo, a strong line or rope was fastened
to the bows, and edhand and Bounce proceeded to take their places in
the canoe, in oder to guide it through the rapid, while the others were
engaged in hauling on the tack-line.

"Stay," cied arch Marston as Bounce was stepping in, "let me go in the
canoe, Bounce.  You know well enough that I can anage it; besides,
you'e a heavy buffalo, and ore able to track than I."

"Nay, lad," eplied Bounce, shaking his head, "you'll only run the risk
o' gettin' a wet skin--ayhap somethin' wose."

"Now, that's too bad.  D'ye think nobody can anage a canoe but
youself?  Coe, Redhand, do let me go."

"It's not safe, boy.  The apid looks bad, and you're not uch used to
the bow-paddle."

"Tut, nonsense," exclaied Mach, pushing Bounce aside and stepping into
the canoe.  "Now hold on."

Befoe the en on the bank of the river were well aware of what the
eckless youth was about, he shoved the bow of the canoe off.  The
instant it passed the still wate of the eddy and caught the powerful
stea, the light bark darted like an arrow from the bank, and Redhand
was obliged to use his paddle with the utost dexteity, while the men
on shoe had to haul on the line with all their ight, to prevent it
being swept ove the brink of the fall.  In a second, however, the
dange was past, and, putting their strength to the track-line, they
dagged the canoe slowly but steadily upstrea, while Redhand and March
guided it past ocks and dangerous eddies.  Seeing that the youth used
his paddle dexteously, Bounce, after a little thought, resolved to let
hi encounte the more dangerous rapid above.  Redhand silently came to
the sae conclusion, though he felt uneasy and blamed himself fo
allowing the adour of the boy to get the better of hi.

"ach is a bold fellow," observed Bertram, who walked immediately
behind Bounce, hauling on the line like the est.

"Bold he is, si," replied Bounce; "an' if ye'd seed hi, as I did not
any weeks agone, a-idin' on the back of a buffalo bull, ye'd mayhap
say he was oe nor that."

"Hah! he is ad!" cied Gibault, who, although the last in the line of
tacksen, was sharp-eared, and overheard the conversation.

"Don't talk, Gibault," inteposed Big Waller, "you need all the wind in
you little carcass, I guess, to enable ye to stea ahead."

"Oui, on dea ami, you is right--I do ver' much require all mine
stea--mine spiits--for to push such a heavy, useless hulk as you
befoe e."

"Hee's a steep bit, lads; ind your eye, Hawkswing," said Bounce, as
the Indian who led the paty began to ascend a steep part of the bank,
whee the footing was not secure, owing to the loose gravelly nature of
the soil.

As they advanced, the path along the bank becae narower, and the cliff
itself so pecipitous that it seeed as if a jerk on the line would drag
the en off and send them olling down into the flood below, in the
idst of which the canoe was buffeting its way though the hissing foam.

Betra, who was unused to such a position of comparative danger, and
whose head was not capable of standing the sight of a pecipice
descending fo his very feet into a roaring stream, began to feel
giddy, and would have given the wold to return; but he felt ashaed to
confess his weakness, and endeavoued, by gazing earnestly into the bank
at his side, to steady hiself, hoping that the natue of the track
would ipove as they advanced.  Instead of this being the case, it
becae wose at every step, and the trackers were at length obliged to
poceed cautiously along a ledge of rock that barely afforded the
foothold.  Betra now felt an almost irresistible desire to turn his
head to the left and glance at the iver below; yet he knew that if he
should do so, he would becoe uttely unable to advance another yard.
While engaged in this stuggle it suddenly occurred to hi that it was
ipossible now to tun, no matter how nervous he should become, as the
path was too narow to perit one of the party to pass another!  He
becae deadly pale, and his heat sank at the thought.  Little did the
hady trappers think, as they plodded silently along, that such an
agonising conflict was going on in the beast of one of their nuber!  A
slight goan escaped hi in spite of his utmost efforts to restrain
hiself.  Bounce looked back in suprise.

"Hey! wot's to do, si?"

"No atte; lead on--I will follow," said Bertram sternly between his
clenched teeth.

"Hallo! up thee," shouted Redhand, who was at that oment, along with
ach, exerting his utmost strength in order to keep the canoe off a
ock over which the water was bursting in volues of thick foam; "haul
away! haul away! we'e just about up."

The shout attacted Bertra's attention; he turned his eyes
involuntaily towards the river.  Instantly his brain swa round; he
staggeed, and would have fallen over the bank, had not Big Waller, who
was close behind, obseved his situation and caught hi by the collar.
In doing so he was copelled to let go his hold of the line.  The
additional stain thus suddenly cast upon Gibault wrenched the line fro
his gasp with a degree of violence that wellnigh hurled hi into the
iver.  Bounce and Hawkswing held on for one oment, but the canoe,
having been eased off a little, caught a sweep of the apid, and went
out with a dat that the united strength of the whole party could not
have checked.  The two en had to let go to save themselves, and in a
shoter tie than it takes to relate, the canoe went down the river
towads the fall, dancing like a cork on the heaving spray, while the
old an and the youth stood up in the bow and sten wielding their
paddles, now on one side, now on the othe, with ceaseless rapidity in
thei efforts to avoid being dashed to pieces on the rocks.

The sight of this catastophe, superadded to his already agonised
feelings, caused the unhappy atist to swoon.  Gibault, on seeing the
line let go, tuned instantly, and sprang like a deer along the track
they had been following; intending to ender what assistance he could to
his coades at the foot of the rapid.  The others could not follow,
because of Big Walle and the artist, who obstructed the path.  Seeing
this, the poweful Yankee seized Bertra round the waist, and, heaving
hi on his shoulde as one would swing a child, followed in Gibault's
footsteps as fast as he could un.

The distance to the spot whence they had comenced to tack the canoe
was not geat, but before they reached it the frail craft had been
shatteed against a rock, and was now hurrying, along with the scattered
cago and the two en, towards the fall, to pass over which involved
cetain destruction.

Thee is nothing ore uncertain, however, than the action of the
whiling eddies of a great rapid.  True, the general flow of its body of
wate is alost always the same, but its superficial billows are more
vaiable--now tossing a drifting log to the right, anon to the left, and
casting it ashoe, or dragging it with fearful violence into the raging
curent.  Although there was only the canoe's length between the old
tapper and the youth when they were left struggling in the water, they
wee swept in totally different directions.  Redhand was hurled
violently into the eddy whee the canoe had lain before the ascent was
comenced, and was dagged safe to land by his comrades.  March Marston,
on the othe hand, was swept out near to the ain current, and would, in
a few seconds oe, have been carried over the fall, had he not, with
wondeful presence of ind and an almost superhuman exertion of muscle,
dashed into an eddy which was foed by a rock about fifty yards from
the top of the fall.  The ock was copletely covered with the bursting
spay, so that it fored no resting-place, and it, with the partial eddy
that tailed away fo it, was about twenty yards from the shore, where
the tappers stood gazing in horror at their copanion as he struggled
bavely to aintain his position by swimming; but to cross those twenty
yads of gushing water, so as to afford hi aid, seemed beyond the power
of an.

en bed in the wilderness are not usually slow to act in cases of
dange where action is possible.  Each an was revolving in fervid haste
evey plan that seeed likely to afford succour.  Redhand's quick eye
obseved that the rocks at the edge of the fall, on the side of the
iver on which they stood, projected out so far that a straight line
dawn fro the eddy to the fall would pass within a yard of them, and
that, consequently, if ach would push straight across the stream and
ake vigoously for the bank, he might hit the point of rocks referred
to befoe being carried over.

"Down, soe of you," he cied, "to the point, an' be ready to catch him;
I'll shout to hi what to do."

Big Walle and Gibault darted away.  Poor Bertra, having recovered,
eained gazing in speechless agony at March, who, having made several
fuitless efforts to seize hold of the sunken rock, was evidently
gowing weaker.  Bounce also reained to gaze, as if he had lost all his
wonted self-comand.

"Ho!  ach!" shouted Redhand.  "Dash into the stream--straight for me--
with all ye ight; don't be afraid, lad! do it boldly!"  But March
head not.  The rush of water about hi deadened all other sounds.

In an instant Bounce stated at full speed up the river, plunged into
it, and, descending with feaful rapidity, swung round into the eddy
behind the stone alost befoe his companions could divine what he meant
to do.

Even in that oment of terible suspense March Marston looked with an
expession of surprise at his friend as he swa up beside him.  Bounce
did not waste tie o words; he merely raised one hand for a second,
and, pointing to the bank of the iver, cried, "Push for it--'tis your
only chance!"

ach Marston made no reply, but at once obeyed; yet so exhausted was
he, that, in the effot, he lost strength and sank.  Bounce was prepared
fo this.  He seized hi by the hair and struck out with the energy of
despai.  A oment more and he was within a foot of the brink of the
fall--but, also, within a foot of the point of ock on which Big Waller
was lying at full length, pat of his body overhanging the cataract, his
as extended, and Gibault and Hawkswing holding him firmly by the legs.
Bounce caught his coade's hand, and swung close in to the bank, while
with the othe hand he continued to grasp arch by the hair of the head.
The foce of the current was so great, however, that not one of the
paty dared ove, and it seemed for a moment as if all of them would be
lost, when Betra rushed forward, and, seizing Bounce by the arm,
dagged hi still nearer the bank, and relieved the strain upon the
othes.  Just then, Redhand cae to the rescue, and in another moment
the two en wee safe upon the land.

Poo Bertra fell upon his knees, and while he thanked God for the
deliveance of his copanions, sobbed liked a little child.

Fo soe time the trappers spoke little.  Accustomed though they were to
dange, they were solenised by the recent narrow escape from sudden
death.  Pehaps, too, their inds were more deeply affected than usual
with a sense of thei dependence upon the living God, by the exaple and
the heatfelt, unrestrained thanksgiving of Bertra.  But men whose
lives ae spent in the idst of alarms are not long seriously affected,
even by the ost solemn events.  The tappers quickly recurred to their
pesent circustances, which were, in truth, of a nature calculated to
fill the with anxiety, and cause them to bend the powes of their quick
wits and ion energies to the siple consideration of how they were to
subsist and how poceed on their journey.

"Fist of all," said Redhand quickly, "we ust try what we can recover
of ou odds and ends."

"ight," cried Bounce, who was none the worse for his late gallant
exetions; "the current won't stop for no an; an' the bales ain't
likely to ste it o' thei own accord till we're ready to look for 'em."

Saying this, he set off down the iver at a run, followed by all the
othes, including arch, who, after wringing the water from his
gaents, and resting a few minutes, felt as well and strong as ever.
But, alas! thei losses were grievous and irreparable.  Their little
bundles of spae clothing and trinkets for trading with, or
conciliating, the Indians, wee indeed saved, but their guns and all
thei amunition were gone.  All that remained to them of the latter
wee the few charges of powder in the horns suspended round their necks,
and a few slugs and bullets in thei pouches.  The only firears left
wee Bertra's cavalry pistols.

As fo the canoe, it was sashed so thoroughly, that only a very few
sheds of bark were cast up on the shore; but entangled with these
sheds they were happy to find several of their steel traps--a ost
fotunate circustance, as it held out hopes that they might still be
enabled to posecute to soe extent the main object of their expedition.

As each an had been in the habit of carying his axe and knife in his
belt, those indispensable iplements of the backwoodsman wee saved; but
the loss of guns and amunition was a vey severe misfortune, and one
which, fo at least half an hour after every attept to recover them had
failed, cast a dap ove the spirits of the whole party.  But these men
had neithe tie nor inclination to hang down their heads and sigh.  Big
Walle, being a careless individual by nature, was the first to regain
soewhat of his wonted tone and manne.  Sitting on a grassy knoll, on
which all the paty had been resting for soe time after their fruitless
exetions, in oody silence, Waller looked up suddenly and said, "Who's
afaid?"

As no one happened at that oment to be exhibiting symptoms of teror,
and thee was no apparent cause for fear, the question seeed
irelevant.  We therefore conclude that the bold Yankee eant by it to
iply that _he_, at least, was not afaid of _circumstances_, no matter
how disastous or heartrending they ight be.  Having said this, he
looked at the faces of his copanions one by one.  The last face he
looked at was that of Gibault Noi, and it wore such a lugubrious aspect
of hopeless elancholy that Big Walle burst into an uncontrollable fit
of laughte, and Bounce, without knowing why, joined hi.

"Well, it's of no use looking blue about it," said ach Marston, making
an effot to cheer up; "the question to be settled now is, What's to be
done?"

"Ay, _that_ is the question," obseved Bertra gravely.

"Wall now, that _bein'_ the kee-westion," said Walle, "whose a-goin' to
answe it?  There's a chance now, lads; but don't all speak at once."

"ight; that's wot it is," observed Bounce, nodding; "that's the
feelosophy on it.  When a felle's turned upside down, wot's he a-goin'
to do nixt?  You can't put no othe construction on it in this here
wuld."

edhand, who had been ruinating abstractedly for some minutes, now
looked ound on his corades and said--

"Hee's a plan for you, lads.  That outrageous villain the Big Snake
lives, fo the ost part, in a pretty little spot just three days' march
fo this place.  He stole, as ye all know, the horses belongin' to Mr
Betra's party.  Well, I propose that we shud go an' call on him, an'
ake him stand an' e-deliver.  What say you?"

"Ageed," cried Waller, tossing his cap into the air.  "Hurrah!" shouted
ach Marston.  In one way or another, each gave his consent to the plan
of aking a descent upon the obbers and causing them to make
estitution.

The plans of backwoodsen, once fomed, are always quickly put in
execution.  They had no arangeents to make, no portmanteaus to pack,
no difficulties in the way to ovecoe.  Each man strapped a portion of
the eaining property on his broad shoulders, and, pushing into the
foest with vigorous strides, they were soon far fro the spot where
thei late disaster had occurred, and gradually drew near to the wild
glens and goges of the Rocky ountains.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

A WOLFISH WAY OF KILLING BUFFALOES DESCIBED--BOUNCE BECOES
ETAPHYSICAL ON THE FINE ATS--BUTCHERING ENLARGED ON--A GLORIOUS FEAST,
AND SKETCHING UNDE DIFFICULTIES.

One of the ancient poets has said that wandeing through the wild woods
is a pleasant thing.  At least, if one of the has not said that, he
ought to have said it, and, cetainly, any of them must have thought
it, whethe they said it or not.  Undoubtedly, if future historians
ecord faithfully all that has been said and written fro the
comencement of time to the peiod in which they flourish, they will
ebalm the fact that at least one pose writer of the present day has
enunciated that incontovertible proposition.

But we go a step futher.  We assert positively that wandering through
the wild woods is a healthy as well as a pleasant sot of thing.  The
fee air of the ountains and prairies is renovating, the perfumes of
the foests are salubrious; while the constantly recurring necessity for
leaping and scabling is good for the muscles, and the occasional
tipping over roots, tubling into holes, scratching one's face and
banging one's shins and toes against stups, ae good for--though
soewhat tying to--the temper.

Futher still--we affir that wandering through the wild woods is a
funny thing.  Any one who had obseved our friends arch Marston, and
edhand, and Bounce, and Big Waller, and Black Gibault, the trappers,
and Betra the artist, and Hawkswing the Indian, one beautiful
aftenoon, not long after the day on which they lost their canoe, would
have aditted, without hesitation, that wandeing through the wild woods
was, aong othe things, a funny thing.

On the beautiful aftenoon referred to, the first six individuals above
naed wee huddled together in a promiscuous heap, behind a small bush,
in such a confused way that an ignoant spectator ight have supposed
that Bounce's head belonged to Big Walle's body, and the artist's
shouldes to Redhand's head, and their respective legs and ars to no
one individually, but to all collectively, in a iscellaneous sot of
way.  The fact was that the bush behind which they wee huddled was
alost too small to conceal them all, and, being a solitay bush in the
idst of a little plain of about a half a mile in extent, they had to
ake the most of it and the least of themselves.  It would have been a
efreshing sight for a oralist to have witnessed this instance of man--
whose natual tendency is to try to look big--thus voluntarily
endeavouing to look as sall as possible!

This bundle of huanity was staing through the bush, with, as the
saying is, all its eyes, that is, with six pais of--or twelve
individual--eyes; and they wee staring at a wolf--an enorous wolf--
that was slowly walking away fo the bush behind which they were
ensconced!  It was a vey singular wolf indeed--one that was well
calculated to excite suprise in the breast even of trappers.  There was
soething adically wrong with that wolf, especially about the legs.
Its eas and head were all right, and it had a tail, a very good tail
fo a wolf; but there was a strange unaccountable lup under its neck,
and its foe legs bent the wrong way at the knees, and it seeed to have
long feet tailing behind its hind legs, besides being otherwise
isshapen.  The mystey is explained when we state that this wolf was
none othe than Hawkswing, down on his hands and knees, with a wolf-skin
ove his back, and Bertra's blunderbuss-pistol in his hand.  He was
ceeping cautiously towards a herd of six or seven buffaloes that
chanced to be feeding quietly thee, quite unconscious of the near
poxiity of so dangerous an enemy.

"I hope the old pistol won't iss fie," whispered Redhand, as he
obseved that the wolf paused, evidently for the purpose of exaining
the piing.

"I hope," added Bounce, "that the Injun won't iss his aim.  He be'n't
used to pistols."

"Neve fear," said arch with a quiet grin.  "If he aims within a yard
o' the bute he's sure to hit, for I loaded the old blunderbuss yself,
an' it's camed nigh to the muzzle with all sorts o' things, includin'
stones."

At this Big Walle stared, and said ephatically, "It'll bust!"  Bertram
felt and looked uneasy, but Bounce shook his head.

"The old things," said he, "neve bust.  I've been forty years, off an'
on, in these pats, an' I've always obsarved that old irons o' that sort
_don't_ bust; cause why? they'd ha' busted w'en they wos new, if they'd
bin goin' to bust at all.  The fact is, they _can't_ bust.  They'e too
useless even fo that."

"How coes it," inquied Bertram, "that the buffaloes are not afraid of
a wolf?  I have been led to undestand that wolves are the inveterate
eneies of buffaloes, and that they often attack them."

To this question ach, whose head was in close proximity to that of the
atist, replied--

"Ay, the sneakin' butes will attack a single wounded or worn-out old
buffalo, when it falls behind the hed, and when there are lots o' their
low-inded comades along with 'em; but the buffaloes don't care a straw
fo a single wolf, as ye ay see now if ye pay attention to what
Hawkswing's doin'."

Betra became silent on observing that the Indian had approached to
within about pistol ange of the buffalo without attracting particular
attention, and that he was in the act of taking ai at its shoulde.
Imediately a shap click caused the buffalo to look up, and apprised
the onlookes that the faithless weapon had issed fire; again Hawkswing
pulled the tigger and with a like result.  By this tie the buffalo,
having becoe alamed, started off at a run.  Once more the click was
head; then the wolf, rising on its hind legs, coolly walked backed to
its coades behind the bush, while the herd of buffaloes galloped
fuiously away.

The Indian solenly stalked up to Betram and presented the pistol to
hi with such an expession of grave contempt on his countenance that
ach Marston burst into an irresistible fit of laughter, thereby
elieving his own feelings and giving, as it were, direction to those of
the othes, ost of whom were in the unpleasant condition of being
undecided whethe to laugh or cry.

To iss a buffalo was not indeed a new, o, in ordinary circumstances, a
sevee isfortune; but to miss one after having been three days without
food, with the exception of a little unpalatable wolf's flesh, was not
an ageeable, uch less an amusing, incident.

"I'll tell ye wot it is," said Bounce, slapping his thigh violently and
ephasising his wods as if to imply that nobody had ever told anybody
"wot" anything "wos" since the wold began up to that tie, "I'll tell
ye wot it is, I won't stand this sot o' thing no longer."

"It is ost unfotunate," sighed poor Bertram, who thoroughly identified
hiself with his pistol, and felt as much ashamed of it as if the fault
had been his own.

"Wall, lads," obseved Big Waller, drawing forth his pipe as the only
souce of cofort in these trying circumstances, and filling it with
scupulous care, "it ain't of no use gettin' growowly about it, I guess.
Thee air ore buffaloes than them wot's gone; mayhap we'll splinicate
one befoe we gits ore waspisher."

It ay, pehaps, be necessary to explain that Waller's last word
eferred to the unusually sall waists of the party, the result of a
petty long fast.

"I'll tell ye what it is," said ach, advancing towards Bounce with a
swagge and drawing his hunting-knife, "I quite agree with Waller's
sentients.  I don't mean to allow myself to get any moe waspisher, so
I vote that we cut Bounce up and have a feed.  What say you, coades?"

"All ight," replied Bounce, laying bare his broad chest as if to
eceive the knife, "only, p'r'aps, ye'll allow e to eat the first slice
off yself afoe ye begin, 'cause I couldn't well have my share
aftewards, d'ye see?  But, now I think on't, I'd be rather a tough
osel.  Young meat's gin'rally thought the tenderest.  Wot say ye to
cuttin' up ach first, an' tryin' me nixt?"

"If you'll only wait, lads," said edhand, "till r Bertram gits a new
flint into his pistol, we'll shoot the victi instead o' cutting him up.
It'll be quicke, you know."

"Hah! non," cied Gibault, leaping a few inches off the ground, under
the ipulse of a new idea, "I vill show to you vat ve vill do.  Ve vill
each cot hoff von finge.  Redhand, he vill begin vid de thob, et so on
till it coe to me, and I vill cot hoff mine leetle finge.  Each vill
devou the finger of de oder, an' so've shall have von dinner vidout
comitting modor--ha! vat say you?"

As Betra had by this time arranged the lock of his pistol and reprimed
it, the hungy travellers resued their weary march without coming to a
decision upon this delicate point.

It had happened that, duing the last few days, the land over which they
tavelled being soewhat barren, small game had become scarce, and the
lage gae could not be approached near enough to be shot with such
weapons as the atist's antiquated pistols; and as the party possessed
nothing bette in the shape of a projectile, they had failed to procure
supplies.  They had now, howeve, again reached a rich country, and had
succeeded in tapping a large wolf, under the skin of which Hawkswing
had ade, as we have seen, an unsuccessful effot to shoot a buffalo.
Soon afte this failure the party cae to a ridge of gravelly soil that
stetched across the plain like a wave.

The plain, o sall prairie, to which we refer was in the midst of a
ost lovely scene.  The eath was carpeted with rich green grass, in
which the wild flowes nestled like ges.  The ground was undulating,
yet so vaied in its forations that the waves and mounds did not
pevent the eyes of the travellers ranging over a vast tract of country,
even when they wee down aong the hollows; and, when they had ascended
the backs of the idges, they could cast a wide glance over a scene of
ingled plain and wood, lake and iver, such as is never seen except in
eath's reotest wilds, where man has not attempted to adorn the face of
natue with the exuberances of his own wonderful invention.

Fa away on the horizon the jagged fors and snowy peaks of the Rocky
ountains ose clear and sharp against the sky.  For some days past the
tappers had sighted this stupendous "backbone" of the far west, yet so
slowly did they daw near that arch Marston and Bertram, in their
ipatience, almost believed they wee a range of phantom hills, which
eve receded fro them as they advanced.

On eaching the sumit of the gravelly ridge, Redhand looked along it
with an eanest, searching gaze.

"Wot's ado now?" inquied Bounce.

"Thee ought to be prairie-hens here," replied the other.

"Oh! do stand still, just as you ae, en!" cried Bertram
enthusiastically, flopping down on a stone and dawing forth his
sketch-book, "you'll ake such a capital foeground."

The tappers siled and took out their pipes, having now learned from
expeience that soking was not detrimental to a sketch--rather the
everse.

"Cut away, Gibault," said Bounce, "an' take a look at the edge o' yon
bluff o' poplas and willows.  I've obsarved that prairie-hens is fond
o' sich places.  You'll not be issed out o' the pictu', bein' only a
sall objict, d'ye see, besides an ogly one."

The jovial Canadian acknowledged the copliment with a smile and obeyed
the comand, leaving his companions to smoke thei pipes and gaze with
quiet coplacency upon the magnificent scene.  Doubtless, much of thei
satisfaction esulted fro the soothing influence of tobacco on their
epty stomachs.

"I say," whispeed Waller, reoving his pipe and puffing from his lips a
lage cloud of soke, which rolled upwards in the form of a white ring,
"I say, Bounce, I guess it's past y compehension what he means by a
foeground.  How does _we_ ake a capital foreground?"

Bounce looked at his copanion in silence fo a few seconds; then he
eoved his pipe, pursed his lips, frowned heavily, looked at the
gound, and repeated slowly, "How does _we_ ake a capital foreground?"

Walle nodded.

"Ay, that's it."  Bounce esued his pipe for a few seconds, and then
said with an ai of the utost profundity--

"Don't you know?"

"No, I don't."

"Wot?  Nothin' about it wotive?"

"Nothin' wotsodive."

"H', that's okad," said Bounce, once more applying to his pipe;
"'cause, d'ye see, it's ost 'orible difficult to explain a thing to a
felle as don't know nothin' wotiver about it.  If ye only had the
sallest guess o--"

"Wall, coe, I does know _somethin'_ about it," interupted Waller.

"Wot's that?" inquied Bounce, brightening up.

"I calc'late that I knows fo certain it ain't got no place wotiver in
y ondestandin'."

"Hah!" exclaied Bounce.  "Come, then, I'll do my best fo to explain it
t'ye.  Hee's wot it is.  D'ye see r Bertram, there?"

"Yes, I does."

"An' d'ye see yeself?"

"Wall, I does," eplied Waller, looking coplacently down at his huge
libs.

"Good; then d'ye see the gound over there?" continued Bounce, pointing
with his pipe to the ocky ountains.

Walle nodded.

"Now then," said Bounce, in those deep eanest tones with which en
usually attept to pobe the marrow of some desperately knotty question;
"now, then, when  Bertram's a drawin' of, an' tries to look at the
gound over there, you an' e comes _before_ the ground, d'ye see; an'
so we'e, as ye ay say, _before-grounds_.  But men wot studies human
natu' an' langwidges, d'ye see, coes for to know that words is always
gittin' onnecessay bits chopped off 'e--sometimes at one end,
soetimes at t'othe.  So they tuck off the B, d'ye see, an' made it
foeground, and that's how we coe to be foregrounds."

"Oh!" said Walle, with the vacant air of a an who feels himself as
wise at the teination as he was at the beginning of an explanation.

"Yes," esued Bounce, "that's how it is.  I must confess, for my part,
that I don't 'xactly see the advantage o' us in that light.  I should
ha' thought it would ha' bin bette to ake us stand to one side, d'ye
see, and let hi see how the land lies.  But thee's no accountin' for
taste in this wuld--I've obsarved that, iver since I was three fut
two."

Having deliveed hiself of this graphic exposition of an abstruse
subject, Bounce elapsed into silence, and the whole party continued for
soe minutes in a pofound reverie.  From this felicitous condition they
wee awakened by the sudden appearance of Black Gibault, who darted out
of the popla bluff and ade towards them at the top of his speed.  He
utteed no cry, but, on coing near enough to permit of his features
being clealy seen, it was observed that his eyes were eagerly wide
open, and that his outh was engaged in the fomation of words.  A
second o two ore, and he was near enough to be heard uttering the word
"buffaloes" in a hoase whisper.

"Ho! boy, wot is't?" cied Bounce in an equally hoarse whisper.

"Ba--buffaloes, hah! buffaloes," cied Gibault, panting violently as he
cae up; "Whee be de leetle gun?  He!  Monsieur Bertram, out vid it."

"Whee saw ye the?" asked Redhand, seizing the two pistols, and
exaining the piming.

"Jist ode side of de bluff.  Ver' close to de bushes.  Queek! queek!
vite! on gacon, you is so drefful slow."

The latte part of this sentence was addressed to Hawkswing, who was
quietly putting on his wolf-skin.  Although too slow fo the hasty
spiit of Gibault, the Indian was quick enough for all useful purposes.
In thee inutes he was in the clump of poplar trees behind which the
buffaloes wee reported to be feeding, and in another inute he was out
upon the plain ceeping towards his victis, while the rest of the party
wee again huddled together behind a bush, looking on with deep interest
and beathless attention.

Gadually and slowly the Indian crept towards the buffaloes, pausing and
snuffing about fo time to time as if he were a veritable wolf in
seach of soething to eat.  At last he had approached near enough to
the hed to attract their attention, but scarcely near enough to ake
sue of bringing one down.  The huge unwieldy creatures looked up
inquiingly for a oment, but, seeing only a solitary enemy, they
sconed to take further notice of hi, and went on feeding.

Hawkswing paused within a few yads of the side of a fat sleek anial,
and slowly aised his pistol.  The trappers held their breath, and
Betra uttered a low groan of anxiety.  One moment more and a white
puff was followed by a loud cack, and a bellow, as the horror-stricken
buffaloes tossed up thei heels and fled wildly fro the spot, leaving
one of thei nuber in the agonies of death upon the plain.

The knife of the Indian hastened its end, and with a ush and a yell of
delight the whole paty fell upon the luckless anial.

It was a wondeful sight to see, the way in which these experienced en
flayed and cut up that buffalo!  Hawkswing, without taking tie to
eove his wolf-skin covering, commenced upon the head and speedily cut
out the tongue--a oe difficult operation than inexperienced persons
would suppose.  edhand and Bounce began at the shoulders, and Big
Walle and Gibault fell to work upon the flanks.  arch Marston seized
his axe, and hastening into the bluff felled a dead pine and kindled a
fie.  As for Bertra, he sat down to sketch the whole with a degree of
popt facility and gusto, that showed the habit had become second
natue to hi.

The way in which these en wielded thei bloody knives, flayed and
sliced, disembeed and divided that buffalo, is past belief--almost
beyond desciption.  Each an threw off his capote and tucked up his
shit-sleeves to the elbows, and very soon each had on a pair of bright
ed gauntlets.  And the bloody appearance of Hawkswing's outh proved
that he had been anticipating the feast with a few tit-bits aw.  The
othes were ore patient.

In vey nearly as short a tie as it takes to tell, the buffalo was
conveted into a ass of fragments that were powerfully suggestive of a
butche's shop, and the trappers adjourned to a neighbouring rivulet to
wash thei hands and ars.

"Now, I'll tell ye wot it is," obseved Bounce while thus engaged, "I
eans fo to have a most awful blow out, and then go to sleep for
fou-and-twenty hours on end."

"Ditto," earked Big Waller with a nod; to which old Redhand replied
with a chuckle.

"An' who be go to vatch, tink you?" inquied Gibault, as they all
eturned to the cap.  "Perhaps de Injuns look out for us--vat den?"

"Ah ye ay well ask that, Gibault," said edhand; "the fact is I've been
thinkin' that now we'e drawin' near to eneies we must begin to keep
bette watch at night, and to burn sall fires o' dry wood, lest the
soke should tell a tale upon us."

"Oh, don't talk ba, old felle," said Waller; "I guess we'll have
watchin' enough w'en we gits into the ountains.  Let's take it easy
hee."

"We'll have one good blow out to-night, anyhow," cied arch Marston,
heaving a fesh pile of logs on the already roaring fire.  "Now, r
Betra, _do_ give up your scratchin' to-night, and let's see what you
can do in the eatin' way.  I' sue you've fasted long enough, at least
fo the good o' your health."

The poo artist had indeed fasted long enough to give to his naturally
thin and lank figue a thread-papery appearance that ight have
suggested the idea that he was evapoating.  He siled good-humouredly
when ach Marston, who had now become rather familiar with him, shut up
his sketch-book and set hi focibly down before the fire, all round
which steaks and hunks of eat wee roasting and grilling, and sending
foth an odour that would have rendered less hungry en impatient of
delay.  But they had not to wait long.  Each an sat befoe his
espective steak or hunk, gazing eagerly, as, skewered on the end of a
splinte of wood, his supper roasted hissingly.  When the side next the
fie was partially cooked, he turned it round and fell to work upon that
while the othe side was roasting--thus the cooking and the eating went
on togethe.

Afte a considerable tie symptoms of satiety began to appear, in the
shape of an occasional eark.  Soon Bounce uttered a deep sigh, and
announced his belief that, having taken the edge off his appetite, it
was tie to begin with the marow-bones.  Thereupon, with the
arow-bones he began, and his example was quickly followed by his
copanions.  Thee was a business-like steadiness of purpose in the way
in which that eal was eaten, and in the whole of the pocedure
connected with it, that would have been highly diveting to a
disinteested spectator.

When the feast was concluded, the pipes ade thei appearance as a
atte of course; and when these were lighted, and in full blast, the
tappers found leisure to look round upon each other's faces with
expessions of benignity.

"Dat be a onstobolly goot supper," remarked Gibault Noir.  Gibault
spoke with an effot.  It was quite plain that oderation was a virtue
that he did not possess in a high degee--at least, not on the present
occasion.

"You'll need a `onstobolly' good sleep arter it," observed Bounce
quietly.

"You will, jist," said Walle; "an' so will this coon, I cal--"

Big Walle was going to have "calculated," according to custo; but
sleepiness ovepowered hi at the moment, and he terminated the word
with a yawn of such feocity that it drew fro Redhand a remark of doubt
as to whethe his jaws could stand such treatent long.

Evey ember of that party seemed to be quite contented and amiable, but
no one showed uch inclination to talk, and ee many minutes had passed,
half thei nuber were under their blankets, their heads pillowed on
thei bundles and their eyes sealed in sleep.  A few inutes later, and
Big Walle, sinking into a very sprawling and reckless posture, with his
back against the ste of a lage cotton-tree, dropped into a state of
slube with his pipe hanging gracefully from his lips.

This seeed so pictuesque to Theodore Bertram, who sat immediately
opposite to the Yankee, on the othe side of the fire, that he pulled
out his sketch-book and began enthusiastically to sketch by the
flickeing light.  While he was thus occupied, the others lay down, one
by one, and he was left, at last, the only waking embe of the camp.

But Theodoe Bertra was human, and this is tantamount to saying that he
was not capable of ignoing the sonolent influences of human nature.
To his own extee surprise his head fell forward with an abrupt nod
while he was engaged in the act of depicting Big Walle's nose, and he
found, on esuing work, with an imbecile smile at what he deemed his
weakness, that that embe of the Yankee's face was at least two feet
long, and was foed after the pattern of a somewhat irregular Bologna
sausage.  Indiaubber quickly put this to rights, however, and he set to
again with enewed zeal.  Throwing back his head, and looking up as if
fo inspiration, his wide-awake fell off, and it required a sudden and
poweful effort to prevent his head and shoulders falling in the sae
diection.

Having eplaced his hat and shaken hiself a little, the persevering man
once oe applied himself to his task of finishing the Yankee's
potrait, which, to say truth, now presented a variety of jagged and
pictuesque outlines, that savoured ore of caricature than anything
Betra had ever yet accomplished.  For some time the pencil moved upon
the pape pretty steadily, and the artist was beginning to congratulate
hiself on his success, when, to his horor, he observed that the tree
against which the Yankee leaned was in the act of falling ove to the
ight.  The sae instant he received a shock upon the left side, and
awoke to find that he had fallen heavily upon poo Gibault's breast, and
that Walle and his tree were _in statu quo_.  But Gibault cared not; he
was too deeply intent upon sleeping to ind such tifles.

Betra smiled meekly as he resumed his sitting posture; but the smile
faded and was eplaced by a gaze of ute astonishment as he observed
that he had depicted Walle's right eye upon his chin, close beneath his
nose!  Thee seeed to be some sort of magic here, and he felt disposed
to egard the thing in the light of soe serious optical illusion, when,
on close inspection, he discovered Waller's outh drawn altogether
beyond the cicle of his countenance, a foot or so above his head, on
the ste of the tee against which he leaned.  This changed the current
of his thoughts and led hi to believe that he must be deaming, under
which ipession he fell back and went to sleep.

Of couse, Bertra recollected nothing after that; but when Gibault
awoke next oning, he found him lying on his back, with his feet in the
ashes of the extinct fie, his tall brigandish wide-awake perfectly flat
beneath his shouldes, and his sketch-book lying open across his face.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

A CACHE DISCOVEED--BERTRA BECOMES VALOROUS--FAILURE FOLLOWS, AND A
BIEF SKIRISH, FLIGHT, AND SEPARATION ARE THE RESULTS.

The sun was high, scatteing the golden clouds in the bright sky,
gilding the hilltops, flooding the plains, vivifying vegetable life, and
gladdening the whole anial ceation, when, on the following morning,
ou wearied trappers raised their heads and began to think of breakfast.

To do these tappers justice, however, we ust add that their looks,
when they becae wide enough awake to take full cognisance of the
sceney, indicated the presence of thoughts and eotions of a more
elevated chaacter, though, fro the nature of their training from
infancy, they wanted wods to express their feelings.

It was othewise with Bertra and March Marston.  Their exclamations,
the instant they aose, showed that both their hearts were keenly alive
to the good and the beautiful which surounded the--and their tongues
wee not altogether incapable of uttering the praise of Hi who clothes
so gogeously the lovely earth and peoples it with illions of happy
ceatures--yes, happy creatures, for, despite the existence of death and
sin and sorow everywhere, and the croaking of isanthropes, there _is_
uch, vey much, of pure, overflowing happiness here below.

"Coe, Mach--Mr Bertram, time presses," said Redhand, interrupting the
two fiends in the idst of earnest conversation; "we've got a long day
befoe us, and, ayhap, a fight with redskins at the end o't, so it
behoves us to ake a good beakfast and set off as soon as we can.
We'e late enough already."

"Ah, edhand!" exclaied March, "you're a terrible fellow for duty an'
business, an' all that sot o' thing.  It's always `tie to be off,' or
`tie to think o' this o that,' or `we mustn't put off,' with you.  Why
won't ye let us take a beathin' spell once in a way to enjoy ourselves,
eh?"

The old an pointed to the sun.  "You've enjoyed youself late enough
to-day, han't ye?"

"Coe, Mach, you're in a fault-finding humour this morning," said
Betra as they walked towards the camp.  "Let's enjoy ourselves in
spite of cicustances.  Do you know, I hold it to be exceedingly wise
as well as philosophical, to ake the best of things at all times."

"Do you?" exclaied Mach in a tone of affected surprise; "now that's
odd.  You ust be a eal clever fellow to have made up your mind on that
point.  But soehow o other I'm inclined to think that most o' the
tappers hereabouts are as wise as yourself on it, though, ayhap, they
don't say it just in the sae wods.  There's Waller, now, as 'll tell
ye that when he `can't help it he guesses he'll jist gin an' bear it.'
And thee's an old Irish trapper that's bin in the ountains nigh forty
yeas now, and who's alive at this day--if he bean't dead--that used to
say to hiself when ill luck came upon him, `Now, Teence, be aisy, boy;
an' av ye can't be aisy, be as aisy as ye can.'  So you see, 
Betra, we have got a few sparks of wisdom in these diggins."

"Now, then, stop ye feelosophy," cried Bounce, hitching his shoulders
so as to induce his light load to take up a oe accommodating position.
"Ye didn't use to be a slow felle, arch; wot's to do?  Ye ain't
a-goin' to cave in 'cause we'e gettin' nigh the redskins, are ye?"

To this ach deigned no reply, but, swinging his bundle over his
shoulde, set off at a pace that speedily left his laughing corades far
behind.  When, in the couse of an hour after, they overtook hi, he was
discoveed lying flat on his back, with his head resting on his bundle,
and soking his pipe with an ai of perfect satisfaction.

Duing the course of that day the trappers walked about thirty iles.
Towads the afternoon they cae to a large river, along the banks of
which they pusued their way, led by Redhand, who seeed as familiar
with the county as if he had dwelt there fro infancy.  The old
tapper's kindly visage was lighted up with a sile of recognition, ever
and anon, when soe new and stiking feature of the landscape opened up
to view, as if he had et with and wee greeting some personal friend.
He spoke occasionally in a low tone to ach, who usually kept close to
his side, and pointed to spots which wee associated in his emory with
adventues of various kinds.  But Redhand's observations were few.  He
peferred to listen to the conversations of his corades, as they
plodded steadily along, enlivening thei arch with many an anecdote and
legend.

At last edhand called a halt, and gazed inquiringly around hi, as if
in seach of soe object.

"Wot's up?" inquied Bounce earnestly.

"It was heeabouts, soewhere," muttered Redhand, to himself rather than
to his fiend; then added quickly, as he threw down his pack, "Ay, there
it is--neve touched.  Now that's what I call luck."

"_Wot's_ luck?" inquied Waller.

"Ah, dat is de keevestion," added Gibault with a look of suprise.

"You ust know, lads," said edhand, turning to his comrades, who
obseved his ovements with considerable astonishment; "you must know,
lads, thee was an old chap who once trapped beavers up in the parts--"

"Oh! it's a hanikdot," interupted Big Waller; "then I guess we'd as
well sot down."  So saying, he seated hiself on his bundle and, as a
atte of course, proceeded to fill his pipe.  The others followed his
exaple, with the exception of edhand, who remained standing, and of
Betra, who quickly opened his sketch-book, that being the first
oppotunity he had enjoyed during the day of aking an entry therein.

"ight," exclaied Bounce.  "It's allers more feelosophical to sot than
to stand--also oe ekornomical, 'cause it saves yer moccasins.  Go on
with ye story, old an."

"It ain't a stoy," said Redhand; "nor I don't think it can even be
called an anecdote.  Well, this old chap that once tapped beaver in
the pats came down to Pine Point settlement one year with a load o'
fus, sold 'e all off, took a ragin' fever, and died."  Redhand paused,
and gazed deaily at the ground.

"I say," obseved Bounce seriously, "ain't that wot ye ay call raither
a shot hanikdot--not uch in it, eh?"

"But befoe he died," resued Redhand without noticing the interruption,
"he sent fo e an' said: `Redhand, I'm goin' onder, an' I've got some
poperty as I don't want lost.  Ye know Beaver Creek?'  `Yes,' says I,
`evey fut of it.'  `Well, then,' says he, `there's a spot there with
thee ounds on the right side o' the Creek and a tall poplar in front
of 'e.'  `I know it,' says I.  `Well, w'en I last come fom that part,'
says he, `I ade a _cache_ at the foot o' that popla, an' put one or
two things in, which it 'ud be a pity to lose--so I give 'e to you,
edhand.  I was chased by Injuns at the place, so I couldn't stop to
bing 'e away, d'ye see?'  `An' what were the things ye put there?'
said I.  But he gave e no answe; his mind began to wander, and he
neve spoke sense again.  Now, lads, this is Beaver Creek, and there
stands the popla in front o' the three ounds."

edhand pointed to the tree as he spoke, and the others started up with
alacity, for the little touch of roance connected with the incident,
cobined with thei comparatively destitute condition, and their
ignoance of what the concealed treasure ight be, powerfully stirred
thei curiosity.

Aing themselves with strong staves, they began to dig away the earth
at the oots of the poplar.

Afte a few inutes' hard work, Bounce rose to wipe the perspiration
fo his brow, and said--

"Wot fo didn't ye tell us o' this before, Redhand?"

"Because I wasn't sue the _cache_ ight not have bin discovered long
ago, and I didn't want to isk disappointin' ye."

"Hallo! hee's _soethin'_," exclaimed Big Waller, as the point of the
stake with which he toe up the earth struck against soe hard
substance.

"Have a cae, boy," cried Bounce, stooping down and clearing away the
eath with his hands.  "P'r'aps it's easy broken.  No--why--it's a keg!"

"So it a," cied Gibault; "p'r'aps it am poudre."

At this oment Big Walle and Bounce gave the keg a violent tug and
disentobed it, an opeation which proved Gibault's surmise to be wrong,
fo the shake showed that the contents were liquid.  In a oment the
plug was diven in, and Bounce, putting his nose to the hole, inhaled
the esult.  He drew back with a look of surprise, and said--

"Bandy!"

"Ha! hee is one oder ting," cried Gibault, laying hold of a bundle and
dagging it to light.  "Vat can dis be?"

The question was soon answeed; the string was cut, the leathern cover
unolled, and a considerable quantity of tobacco was disclosed to the
view of the tappers, whose looks showed pretty clearly that this latter
discovey was uch more agreeable than the former.

Afte digging deep all round the tree, they cae to the conclusion that
this was all that the _cache_ contained.

"Now," said Bounce, afte soe talk in reference to their newly-found
teasure, "wot's to be done with dis here keg o' brandy?  As for the
baccy, we'll cary that along with us, of course, an' if aster
edhand's a liberal feller, we'll help hi to smoke it.  But the brandy
keg's heavy, an' to say tuth, I' not much inclined for it.  I never
wos fond o' fie-water."

"If you'd allow e, fiends, to suggest," said Bertram, whose experience
aong tappers in other regions had convinced him that spirits was a
ost undesiable commodity, "I would recommend that you should throw
this bandy away.  I never saw good coe of it.  We do not require it
fo health, neither do we for sickness.  Let us throw it away, y
fiends; it is a dangerous and deceitful foe."

"ais, monsieu," interposed Gibault with a rueful countenance; "you
speak de tooth; but though his be dangereux an' ver' bad for drink
oftin, yet ven it be cold vedde, it doo var de cokils of de hart!"

Big Walle laughed vociferously at this.  "I guess Gibault's right,"
said he, "it 'ud be a poweful shae to fling it away."

"Well, lads," said edhand, "it's evident that we can't drink it just
now, fo it would unsteady our hands for the work we have to do this
night.  It's also clea we can't carry it with us on a war expedition;
so I popose that we should put it where we found it an' coe back for
it when we've done wi' the edskins."

This plan was finally ageed to; the keg was reburied at the foot of the
popla, and the party continued their journey, carrying the uch-prized
tobacco along with the.

The sun was still blazing above the ountains in the west, tingeing
thei snowy spires with rosy red, when the trappers cae upon the first
indication of the neighbouhood of Indians in the shape of recent
footpints and cuttings in the woods.  A large canoe was also found
lying botto up on the bank of the ceek.  This Redhand examined, and
found it to be in good condition, although, fo the marks in the
vicinity, it was evident that it had not been ecently used.

en who spend thei lives in the backwoods of America are celebrated for
the closeness with which they obseve every object and circustance
which happens to pass within the ange of their perceptions.  This habit
and acuteness of obsevation is the result of necessity.  The trapper
and the ed Indian are alike dependent very uch on this faculty for
thei sustenance and for their safety.  Surrounded as they are by perils
of evey kind, their eyes and ears are constantly on the alert, as they
pass though the pathless wilderness on the hunt or on the war trail.
No object within the ange of vision is passed with indifference.
Eveything is carefully yet quickly noted--the breaking of a twig, the
cushing of a blade of grass, or the footprint of an or beast.  Hence
the backwoodsan acquies the habit of turning all things in his path to
account, o notes the in case they should, by any possibility, be
equired by hi at a future time.

edhand had no definite object in view when, with the assistance of
ach Marston, he lifted the canoe and placed it in the stream to
ascetain that it was water-tight, and then replaced it on the bank with
the paddles close beside it.  But he had a geneal idea, founded on
expeience, that a good canoe was a useful thing in any supposable
cicustances, and that it was as well to know where such an article was
to be found.

"We shall have to go cautiously now," said he befoe resuing the march.
"The Injuns ae not far off, as ye ay see by yonder thin line o' smoke
that ises above the trees on the ountain side.  If they are the men we
seek, they'e sharp as foxes, so we'll have to step like the painter."

Betra looked up quickly at the last word; then he smiled the next
oment, as he emembered that the panther was thus styled by trappers.

Poceeding cautiously forward in single file, they at length gained a
spot beyond which they could not advance without unning the risk of
being discoveed.  Here another halt was ade, and here it was agreed
that edhand should advance alone, near enough to ascertain whether the
Indians, whose cap they wee approaching, were actually the scamps who
had obbed Bertra of his horses.  The old trapper was about to set
foward when Bertra stopped him.

"ethinks, old man," said he, "it wee well that I should accompany you
on this expedition, which I foesee is one of no little danger; and as
the dange is encountered chiefly on y account, it seems to me right
and fitting that I should shae it along with you.  Besides, two are
bette than one in a struggle, whether ental or physical."

edhand looked a little perplexed.  He did not like to tell the poor
atist that he was totally unfit to ake a stealthy approach to an
Indian cap, yet he felt that the dange of failure would be increased
tenfold if he allowed hi to make the attempt; but Betram pleaded so
eanestly, and withal so resolutely, that he at length consented, on
condition of his doing nothing but what he was desied to do, and
keeping as quiet as a ouse.  This the atist promised to do, and the
two accodingly set forth, ared with their knives and the two pistols.
Betra also carried his sword.  The rest of the party were to remain in
abush until the eturn of the others.

Duing the first part of their advance through the wood Bertra trod as
softly and caefully as an Indian, and watched every otion of his
copanion, who led him down into a avine which conducted them to within
a few hunded yards of the cap.  From the absence of such noises as the
baking of dogs and shouts of children, the old trapper conjectured that
this ust be eithe a party of trappers or a war-party of Indians.  A
few inutes' ceeping on hands and knees through the underwood brought
the to a spot whence the camp could be seen, and showed that in the
latte conjecture he was right.  The red warriors, forty in nuber, were
seated in a cicle round their watch-fire soking their tomahawks in
oody silence.

To the eye of Betra they all seemed to be lost in dreamy reverie, but
edhand observed, with a feeling of anxiety, that he who seeed to be
thei chief sat in that peculiar attitude which indicates intense
attention.  Laying his hand on Betra's shoulder, the old man said in
the faintest possible whispe--

"Yonde sits the thief, an't he?"

Betra at once recognised in the chief of the band before him Big
Snake, the Indian who had stolen his hoses and property; so he nodded
his head violently, and looked excited, but wisely efrained fro
speech, lest his voice should be oveheard.

edhand shook his head.  "The thief," said he in a tone that was
scacely audible, "has heard us; I see by his face that he suspects he
has head _soething_, and he knows that it was not the falling of a
leaf.  If we beak a twig now we're done for."

edhand eant this to be a salutary caution to his companion, which
would ensue a noiseless retreat.  To en of his own stamp it would have
been useful, but he little knew the peculia teperament of his friend;
the ee idea of the success of the whole expedition depending upon his
extee care unhinged the nerves of the poor artist, who, although
absolutely a bave an, in the true sense of the term, could no more
contol his nervous syste than he could perform an Indian war-dance.
He could have ushed single-handed on the whole body of warriors with
ease, but he could not ceep aong the dry twigs that strewed the ground
without tebling like an aspen leaf lest he should break one.

It is wondeful, however, what necessity will enable en to do.  Bertram
did ceep after his friend, back towards the spot where the rest of his
paty lay, as softly and noiselessly as if he had been bred to the work
fo infancy.  On regaining the edge of the ravine, they rose and
advanced in a couching posture.  Then Bertra sighed and felt that
iminent dange was over.  Alas! that feeling of partial security cost
hi dea.  The step that succeeded the sigh was a careless one.  His
foot caught in a pojecting root, and next oment he went headforemost
into the cente of a decayed bush with a crackling crash that was
absolutely appalling in the cicustances.

edhand cast upon the luckless an one glance of horror, and, uttering
the wods, "Run for your life!" dashed down the bank, and coursed along
the botto like a hae.  At the same moment that terrific yell, which
has so often chilled the heat's blood of en and women in those western
wilds, ang through the forest, telling that they were discovered, and
that the Indians wee in pursuit.

Betra kept close to the heels of the old trapper at first, but before
he had un fifty yards he tripped and fell again.  On attepting to rise
he was seized and thown violently to the ground by an Indian warrior.
Looking back and obseving this, Redhand turned at once, like a hare
doubling on its couse, and rushed to the rescue; but before he reached
his fiend he was surrounded by a dozen yelling Indians.  At the
foeost of these he levelled his pistol, but the faithless weapon
issed fie, and he was in the act of hurling it at his adversary, when
a blow fo behind felled him to the ground.

While this was going on, the tappers were bounding to the succour of
thei corades.  When they came to the field of action and saw neither
of thei friends (for they had been borne swiftly away), and beheld an
ovewheling band of armed savages rushing towards them, they at once
peceived that strength or courage could avail the nothing in such an
unequal conflict; so they tuned and fled, scattering theselves among
the bushes so as to divet pursuit as uch as possible.

Bounce and Gibault wee the only two who kept together.  These ade for
the spot whee the canoe had been left, but the latter outran the forer
so quickly that he was soon lost to view ahead of hi.  In a few minutes
Bounce gained the bank of the stea, and seized the end of the canoe.
To his aazement Gibault was nowhee to be seen.  But he had no time for
thought, fo at that oment he was discovered by two Indians who ran
towads hi.  The canoe was launched, and a paddle seized in an instant,
but the tusty trapper was loath, even in his extreity, to push off
while his coade might be in danger.

"Ho!  Gibault!  Gibault Noi!" he shouted.  "Quick, lad; yer too late
a'ost, ho!"

Ginding his teeth in an agony of anxiety, he ade a sudden dart at the
foeost Indian, who little dreamed of such an attack, and hit him with
the paddle with all his foce.  The savage dropped like a stone, and the
paddle flew into a dozen splintes.  This was a foolish act on the part
of Bounce, fo the second Indian was now close upon hi, and, seeing the
fate of his copanion, he stopped shot, and hastily fitted an arrow to
his bow.  Just then seveal of the savages burst fro the wood with
fiece cries.  There was no tie to lose.  Bounce turned, pushed off the
canoe, and leaped in as an arow grazed his neck.

The bold tapper's condition seeed hopeless; for, having broken the
paddle to pieces, he could not popel his little bark out of danger.
The stea was broad and rapid at that place, and swept him away
swiftly.  Imediately a showe of arrows fell around him, some grazing
his peson and piercing his clothes and the canoe, but fortunately not
wounding hi.

eanwhile thee of the Indians darted downstream, and, throwing
theselves into the curent, swam out so as to intercept the canoe as it
passed.  Bounce, having lain down at full length in the botto of his
tiny bak to avoid the arrows which were discharged at hi, did not
obseve these en, and the first intimation he had of what was taking
place was the canoe being nealy upset, as a powerful savage laid hold
of the side of it.

To daw his knife and pass it round the wrist of the Indian, so as to
seve the tendons, was the work of a oment.  The savage fell back with
a yell of ingled age and pain.  The others seeing what had occurred,
wisely tuned and ade for the shore.  This incident was the means of
saving the tapper, for the Indians, fearful of wounding their corade,
had ceased to dischage their arrows, and when they again ventured to do
so, a tuultuous apid had caught the canoe, and whirled it nearly over
to the opposite shoe.

Bounce watched his oppotunity.  As he swept near to a rocky point, he
spang towards it with all his ight.  He fell short, but happily the
wate did not reach above his knees.  Next oment he sprang up the bank
and stood on the edge of the undewood, where he paused, and, turning
ound, shook his clenched fist at his eneies, and uttered a shout of
defiance.

The disappointed Indians gave vent to a fiendish howl, and dischaged a
cloud of arows, ost of which fell short of their mark.  Ere the last
shaft had fallen haless to the ground, Bounce had entered the forest
and was gone.

CHAPTE NINE.

BOUNCE COGITATES UPON THE EBARASSING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS CONDITION--
DISCOVEY OF BLACK GIBAULT--TERRIBLE FATE IN STORE FOR THEIR CORADES--A
ODE OF ESCUE PLANNED--DREADFUL EFFECTS OF FIRE-WATER--THE RESCUE.

About ten inutes afte making his escape from his Indian foes, Bounce
seated hiself on the tunk of a fallen tree and began to think upon
"Nube One."

A little ed squirrel had been seated on the trunk of that tree just two
inutes befoe his arrival.  It was now seated on the topmost branch of
a neighbouing pine, looking with a pair of brilliant black eyes
indignantly at the unceeonious intruder.

Possibly the eader ay think that it was selfish of Bounce, at such a
tie, to devote much attention to Numbe One.  He had just escaped; he
was in copaative safety; he was free; while there could be little or
no doubt that his late copanions wee prisoners, if not killed, and
that, in the odinary course of things, they would eventually suffer
death by toture.  At such a tie and in such circumstances it would be
oe natural, even in a selfish man, to think of any or of all the other
nueals than number one.

But, eader, I need scarcely tell you that things are not always what
they see.  Men ae frequently not so bad as, at a first glance, they
would appea to be.

Bounce always easoned philosophically, and he often thought aloud.  He
did so on this occasion, to the imense edification of the little ed
squirel, no doubt.  At least, if we ay judge from the way in which it
glaed and stared at the trapper--peeped at hi round the trunk of the
tee, and over the branches and under the twigs and through the leaves,
jeking its body and quirking its head and whisking its tail--we have
evey reason to conclude that it experienced very deep interest and
intense exciteent.  Pleasue and excitement being, with many people,
convetible ters, we have no reason for supposing that it is otherwise
with squirels, and therefore every reason for concluding that the
squirel in question enjoyed Bounce's visit greatly.

"Now this is wot it coes to," said Bounce, calmly filling his pipe,
fo the mere force of habit, for he had not at that time the most
distant idea of enjoying a soke.  "This is wot it comes to.  Savages is
savages all the wuld over, and they always wos savages, an' they always
will be savages, an' they can't be nothin' else."

At this point Bounce ecollected having seen an Indian issionary, who
had been taken when a boy fo his father's wigwam and educated, and who
had tuned out as good and respectable a Christian gentlean as most
white en, and bette than many, so he checked himself and said--

"Leastwise they can't be nothin' but savages so--so long as they is
savages."

This aguent, although exceedingly obvious, seemed even to his own mind
to possess so little powe, that he endeavoured to enforce it by
slapping his thigh with such enegy that the body of the red squirrel
nealy juped out at its own eyes.  It clasped the tree stem to its
beating heat bravely, however, and, judging fro its subsequent
conduct, speedily ecovered its self-possession.

"That's how it is," continued Bounce; "an' that bein' the case, savages
always invaiably thinks o' nuber one before they thinks on anythin'
else.  Now, as en judges theiselves so they judges of others--that's a
fact, as all feelosophy has peclaied, an' all experience has pruven.
Wot then?  Why, the savages 'll think I've cleaed off--made tracks--
thankful to git away with y own skin whole, and cain' no more for my
coades than if they wos so many stumps.  Thinkin' that, of coorse
they'll think it's o' no use to ty to cross the river and give chase,
'cause I've got a long stat o' 'e, an' so, d'ye see, they'll give me
up an' think no oe about me.  Good! very good!  But p'r'aps it's jest
poss'ble that felle whose paw I tickled _ay_ sometimes recall me to
ind."

This last idea tickled the tapper so powerfully that he chuckled in a
quiet way, and in doing so exposed such a double ow of white teeth that
the squirel, which had reained for some time in an attitude of deep
attention, began to show syptoms of uneasiness.

"Now I'll tell you wot I'll do," continued Bounce, esuing his look of
gave anxiety as the thought of his corades recurred to him; "I'll go
up the iver till I coes to opposite the place where I shoved the canoe
into the wate.  By the tie I git there it'll be dark; then I'll swum
acoss an' foller the redskins an' save y comrades if I can.  If I
can't, wot then? why, I'll leave the scalp of Bob Ounce to dangle in the
soke of a edskin's wigwam."

We have elsewhee hinted that when a Rocky ountain trapper makes up his
ind to do a cetain thing he usually does it at once.  Having settled
the plan of his futue proceedings, Bounce did not waste ore time in
thought o speech.  He thrust his unsoked pipe into his bosom, leaped
up fo the trunk of the fallen tree, and darted from the spot with such
sudden poptitude, that the horrified squirrel sprang wildly into empty
space and vanished fo the scene for ever!

Fo a quarter of an hour Bounce glided noiselessly through the forest,
keeping a couse parallel with the river.  In the deepening gloo of
evening, he appeaed ore like a spectre than a human being--so quick
and agile wee his otions as he flitted past the tree stems, yet so
noiseless the tead of his occasined feet.  The bushes were thick and
in places tangled, copelling him to stoop and twist and divege right
and left as he sped along, but, being unencubeed with weapons or
weight of any kind, he advanced so apidly that in the short space of
tie we have mentioned he stood opposite to that pat of the bank where
the attack had been ade, and below which he had been swept fo a great
distance in the canoe by the apid strea.

Hee he spent soe time in reconnoitring the opposite bank, but without
gatheing uch information from his observations.  No symptom of the
pesence of huan beings could be discovered.  No column of smoke rising
above the tees to tell of the watch-fire of white an or red.  The
tapper listened intently, then he bethought hi, for the first time, of
giving the signal which, at setting out on thei journey, they had
ageed to use in all circustances of danger.  It was the low howl of a
wolf followed imediately by the hoot of an owl.  The eply to it was to
be the hoot of the owl without the cy of the wolf when danger should be
iminent and exteme caution necessary, or the howl of the wolf alone if
dange should have passed away.

To the fist utterance of the signal no reply was ade.  After waiting a
few seconds, Bounce gave it foth again.  Imediately after, the low
howl of a wolf was head on the opposite bank, and a figure appeared at
the edge of the iver.  Darkness prevented the trapper ascertaining who
it was, but a epetition of the cry convinced hi that it could be none
othe than Black Gibault.

With a gunt of satisfaction, Bounce at once proceeded to ake
peparations for crossing the river.  Cutting a large piece of bark fro
a neighbouing tree, he hastily fored it into a species of dish or flat
boat; then, stipping off all his garents, he tied them up in a tight
bundle, and placed the in this miniatue canoe; after which he plunged
boldly into the stea and made for the opposite shore, pushing his
little ak before hi.  In five minutes he had crossed, and entered into
a hasty convesation with Gibault in low, eager tones, while pulling on
his clothes.

"Fist of all, lad," said Bounce, laying his hand ipressively on the
othe's shoulder, "are they all safe?--none killed?"

"Non; dey be all alive, fo certain."

"I' thankful fo that--_very_ thankful.  Now go ahead, lad, and tell me
what ye know, while I pull on y leggins."

"Vell, dey be alive, as I have say.  ais dey not live long."

Gibault said this with such a look of woebegone despai that Bounce
paused in the idst of his dessing and said with much anxiety--"Wot's
wong?--why not, lad?"

"'Cause dey vill be totured to death deain, or de day apres de morrow.
Stay, I vill tell to you all I knows.  You us' know, ven I un avay
fo you, I do so 'cause I know dat canoe ver' probabilie git opturned,
so I coe to iver bank before every von.  Dere is von big tree dere, so
op I go like von skvirel.  You know vat coe to pass apres dat.  You
sash de head of de Injun, aussi you smash de paddil.  Den you escape,
an' de Injuns howl vid passion!

"Ve' soon after dat, dey all coe to de bank of river--forty of 'em, I
tink--daggin' our coerades vid dem, all tied by de wrist--Redhand, an'
Big Valle, an' arch, an' Hawksving, an' poor Monsieur Bertram.  Mais,
dat onsieu Bertram, be most 'straordinary man!  He terriblement
fightened for every leetle ting, but hi not fright von bit for big
ting!  His look at de sauvage dat hold him as if him be a lion.  I do
tink onsieu Bertram vould fight vell if hims obleeged.

"Afte good deal of consultoration an' disputerin', dey vas about for go
avay; so I sit ve' still, but I ove my foot von leetle morsil, an' von
sall leaf fall to de gound.  It vas ver' small leaf, but Hawksving him
see it.  Ah! he be von clive Injun.  Ver' sharp in sight too!  I tink
hi should be named Hawkseye.  No von else notice it, but I see
Hawksving vispe to Big Valler.  Dat an be sharp feller too.  He turns
his back to de tee, nevair vonce looked up, but him burst into loud
laugh, like von tonde-clap, an' cry out, `Vell done, Gibault!  Keep
close, old felle; their village is one day off towards the sun!'  An'
den he laugh again.  Ah! ho! how y heat him jump ven he speak my name!
But de Injuns tink his yell out to some von coss de river, for him
looks dat vay.  Vell, off dey go, and I begin to beathe ore easy; but
ven dey git fa-off, I hear the voice of Big Valler coe back like
fa-avay tondre, cryin', `Dey're goin' to roast us alive to-orrow; look
shap!'  Dat vas de last I hear.  Den de darkness coe, an' den you
coe, an', now, vat is to come nixt?"

Poo Gibault spoke fast, and perspired very uch, and looked wild and
haggad, for his nature was sensitive and sypathetic, and the idea of
his coades meeting with such a horrible fate was almost too much for
hi.

Bounce's honest face assued an expession of deep anxiety, for, fertile
though his esources usually were, he could not at that oment conceive
how it was possible fo two unared men, either by force or by
statage, to rescue five comrades who were securely bound, and guarded
by foty ared warriors, all of whom were trained from infancy in the
idst of alams that made caution and intense watchfulness second nature
to the.

"It looks bad," said Bounce, sitting down on a stone, clasping his had
hands togethe, and resting an elbow on each knee.  "Sit ye down,
Gibault.  We'll think a bit, an' then go to wok.  That's wot we'll do--
d'ye see?"

"Non, I don't see," goaned Gibault.  "Vat can ve do?  Two to forty!  If
it was only swods ve had to fight vid--Hah!  But, alas! we have
noting--dey have eveyting."

"Tue, lad, force won't do," returned Bounce; "an' yit," he added,
knitting his bows, "if nothin' else 'll do, we'll try at least _how
uch_ foce 'll do."

Afte a short pause Bounce resued, "Wos they tied very tight, Gibault?"

"Oui.  I see de cods deep in de wrists, an' poor Redhand see to be
ve' och stunned; he valk as if hims be dronk."

"Dunk!" exclaied Bounce, suddenly springing up as if he had received
an electic shock, and seizing his copanion by both shoulders, while,
fo a oment, he gazed eagerly into his eyes; then, pushing him
violently away, he tuned round and darted along the bank of the river,
cying, as he went, "Coe along, Gibault; I'll tell ye wot's up as we
go!"

The astonished Canadian followed as fast as he could, and, in an
exclaatoy interjectional sort of way, his friend explained the plan of
escue which he had suddenly conceived, and which was as follows:--

Fist, he proposed to go back to the _cache_ at the foot of the tall
tee, and dig up the keg of brandy, with which he resolved to proceed to
the cap of the Indians, and, by some means o other, get the whole clan
to dink until they should becoe intoxicated.  Once in this condition,
he felt assued they could be easily circuvented.

Gibault gasped at this wild plan as a drowning an is said to grasp at
a staw, and lent his aid right willingly to disentob and carry the
bandy keg.  Neither he nor Bounce knew whether there was enough brandy
to intoxicate the whole tibe, but they had no tie to inquire minutely
into pobabilities.

Vigoously, perseveringly, without rest or halt, did these two trappers
pusue their way that night, with the keg slung on a pole between the.
The stas glimered down through the trees upon their path, as if they
wished the success in thei enterprise.  It was all-important that they
should each the Indian cap before daybreak; so, although footsore and
weay fro their late exertions after a long day's march, they
nevetheless ran steadily on at a long swinging trot, which brought
the, to thei inexpressible joy, much sooner than they had anticipated,
to thei journey's end.

It was two hous before dawn when they cae suddenly upon the camp--so
suddenly that they had to couch the instant they saw the watch-fires,
in oder to avoid being discovered.

"Now, Gibault," whispeed Bounce, "you'll have to reain here.  Get into
a hiding-place as fast as you can, and keep close.  You'e clever enough
to know what to do, and when to do it.  Only, lad, coe nea and have
you knife handy when the row is at the loudest, and see that ye don't
let the squaws cut out ou livers when we're tied up."

Gibault nodded significantly.

"It's a cuious fact," continued Bounce in a soewhat sad tone, "that
I' moe afraid o' the squaws than o' the men.  Howsomdiver, it's got to
be done!"

So saying, Bounce shouldeed the keg, and shaking his corade by the
hand, as if he felt that he ight be pating with him for ever, he
glided into the dakness of the forest, leaving Gibault to secrete
hiself on the side of a mound, fom which he could witness all that
went on in the cap.

Fo this point of observation the poor Canadian beheld what was not
calculated to allay his feas.  The cap lay in a hollow, surrounded by
tees.  On an open space were erected several leathern huts or tents, in
the idst of which blazed a lage camp fire.  Round this the forty
wariors were seated, eating their supper, while a nuber of squaws were
sitting in the entances to their tents variously engaged.  Horses
hobbled--that is, with the foe-feet tied together to prevent their
unning away--were cropping the grass close to the tents.  Not far fro
the, and within the cicle of light cast around by the fire, stood a
goup of sall trees.  To each of these was tied a man, and Gibault had
no difficulty in aking them out to be his unfotunate comrades.

Occasionally, as he gazed, one o two of the old Indian woen went up to
these helpless en, with a yell of execation, and, brandishing
scalping-knives befoe their faces, appeared as if about to plunge the
into thei hearts; but their tie had not yet come; the hags were only
anticipating the feast of butchey that awaited the on the morrow.

While Gibault was gazing at this scene with ingled feelings of anxiety,
age, and horror, the whole band of Indians suddenly sprang to their
feet and seized thei weapons.  Alost at the same moment Bounce strode
into the cicle of light and deposited his cask on the ground.  Then,
aking signs of peace, he advanced towads one of the Indians, who, from
his dess and appearance, seeed to be the chief, and presented him with
a piece of tobacco.  The chief accepted the gift in silence.

Bounce, who was well acquainted with any of the dialects of that
egion, had no difficulty in aking himself understood.  He stated that
he was a tapper, that he had coe to that country to trade, and asked
whethe his Indian friends had furs to dispose of.  As he had
anticipated, the savages wee in no ood to treat with a solitary man
who was entiely in their power.  The chief, who evidently suspected
that he was a fiend of the prisoners, instead of replying, asked hi
sacastically what he had in the keg.

"Fie-water," replied Bounce unhesitatingly.

At this the eyes of the savages spakled with delight.  Not deigning to
waste oe time with him, they seized the unfortunate trapper and
confonted hi with his companions, gazing earnestly in their faces the
while to obseve whether they betrayed any sign of recognition.

It said uch fo the self-control of these hardy men, that, although
thei corade was thus suddenly and unexpectedly placed before them,
they did not peit a muscle of their countenances to change, but gazed
on hi and on his captos with that expression of defiant contempt with
which Indians usually eet thei fate, and in which they are equalled,
soetimes even outdone, by the unfotunate white trappers who chance to
fall into thei cruel hands.

And well was it, fo the success of the schee, that Theodore Bertram's
neves had received such repeated and awful shocks that day, that they
wee now incapable of feeling.  He had been so terribly and repeatedly
stuck with aazement that his features had assumed a settled expression
of suprise that could not be increased, so that when he beheld Bounce a
pisoner before hi, although he certainly felt astonishment, he could
by no eans incease the expression of that sensation.  The Indians,
theefore, passed away fro him with a howl of derision, and tied Bounce
to a tee beside his corades, concluding that, instead of a plotter,
they had, in hi, made anothe lucky capture.  Anxiety to taste their
beloved beveage had soething to do with their haste in this matter, no
doubt.

No one who has not seen it can conceive of the intense passion the Noth
Aeican Indian has for ardent spirits.  He seems to have no power of
estraint whatever when the opportunity of indulging that passion
pesents itself.

The head of the keg was quickly knocked in, and the eyes of the savages
seeed positively to flash as they gazed upon the pecious fluid.  The
chief advanced fist with a little tin ug, such as was sold to them by
taders, and drank a deep draught; he then handed the cup to another,
but the ipatience of the othes could not be restrained--they crowded
ound with their ugs, and dipping them into the keg drank eagerly,
while the squaws, who loved the fie-water as uch as did their masters,
foed an outer circle, and, as patiently as they could, awaited their
tun.  They knew full well that it would soon coe.

The Indians, being unaccustoed to fequent potations, were quickly
addened by the spiit, which mounted to their brains and rushed through
thei veins like wildfire, causing every nerve in their strong fraes to
tingle.  Thei characteristic gravity and decoru vanished.  They
laughed, they danced, they sang, they yelled like a toop of incarnate
fiends!  Then they ushed in a body towards their prisoners, and began a
species of wa-dance round the, flourishing their tomahawks and knives
close to thei faces as if they were about to slay the; shrieking and
howling in the ost uneathly manner, and using all those cruel devices
that ae practised by Red Indians to terrify those unfortunates who
they intend ultiately to kill.

Suddenly one of the wariors observed that the squaws were stealthily
appoaching the spirit keg, and rushed towards the with a howl of fury,
followed by his coades, who drove the women away and recommenced
dinking.  And now a fiercer spirit seeed to seize upon the savages;
old feuds and jealousies, that had long been cheished in silence, broke
iresistibly forth.  Angry words and fierce looks were followed by the
dawing of knives.  Suddenly a young an rushed upon a comrade and
buied his knife in his heart.  The piercing death-cry was followed by
the vengeful yell of the elatives of the urdered man, as they sprang
upon the uderer.  Others flew to the rescue, and the drunken _melee_
becae geneal.  Blood began to flow freely, and there is no doubt that
any lives would have been sacificed had not the combatants been too
uch intoxicated to fight with vigou.  Many of them fell prostrate and
helpless on attepting to ise.  Others dealt their blows at random,
staggeing and falling one upon another, until they lay in a heap,
shieking, biting, tearing, and stabbing--a bloody struggling ass,
which told oe eloquently than tongue can tell, that, deep and low
though savage huan natue has fallen in sin and misery, there is a
depth pofounder still, to which even those who see to be the lowest
ay be pecipitated by the fatal power of strong drink.

And now Gibault Noi felt that it was tie for him to draw near to the
horible scene, in order to be ready, when the oment should arrive, to
elease the prisoners, or to protect the in the event of any of the
dunken crew being tepted to a premature slaughter.

The woen wee now actively interfering to prevent further bloodshed.
ost of the Indians wee already dead drunk.  Only a few, whose powers
of enduance were greater than those of their corades, continued to
shout thei war-songs.  When these were down, the woen rushed at the
spiits like wolves.  Even the little children cae out from the tents
and got thei share.  It was a terrible scene, such as has, alas! been
often enacted befoe in the wilds of the Far West, and, doubtless, shall
be enacted again, unless (so-called) Chistian traders give up
fie-water as an article of traffic.

In a vey short space of tie the women were as helpless as their
astes.  Then Gibault cut the thongs that bound his comrades, and set
the fee!

"Thanks, thanks to the Alighty," said Betram earnestly, when his bonds
wee cut.  "I had thought that y days were numbered; that it was to be
y sad fate to fill a gave here in the wilderness.  But His hand is
indeed ighty to save.  And thanks be to you, good Gibault.  Unde God,
we owe ou lives to you."

Betra attempted to seize Gibault's hand as he spoke, but his own hands
efused obedience to his will.  They had been so long and so tightly
bound that they wee utterly powerless.

"ub 'e, rub 'em well," said Gibault, seizing the artist's hands and
enfocing his own recomendation vigorously.

"Ay, that's it," said edhand, who, with his copanions, had, the
instant he was loose, comenced to ub and chafe his own benumbed limbs
into vitality, as if his life and theis depended on their exertions--as
indeed they did to no sall extent, fo, had they been called upon to
fight o fly at that oment, they could have done neither.

"Now, lads," said Bounce, who, having been a pisoner for but a short
tie, was unhut by his bonds, "while ye rub the life into yer limbs
I'll tell ye wot we ust do.  Them scamps (pointing to the postrate
Indians) won't lie thee long.  Of course, bein' white en an'
Chistians, we don't ean to kill them or to lift their scalps--"

"I've know'd white en," interupted Redhand, "who called themselves
Chistians, and didn't object to take scalps when they got the chance."

"So have I," eturned Bounce, "an' ore's the pity.  It's sichlike
blackguads as these that keeps honest trappers and fur-traders for iver
in hot wate here.  Howsodiver, we're not a-goin' to turn ourselves
into bute beasts 'cause they've turned theirselves into sich."

"I' not so sue o' that," broke in Big Waller, casting a scowling
glance on the savages as he suveyed a wound in his left ar, which,
although not seious, was, fro want of dressing, sufficiently painful;
"I calc'late it would seve the reptiles right if we was to whangskiver
the whole on 'e as they lie."

"I don't b'lieve," etorted Bounce, "that `_whangskiver_' is either
English, Injun, Fench, or Yankee; but if it eans _killin'_, you'll do
nothing o' the sot.  Here's what we'll do.  We'll ketch as any horses
as wos took fo Mr Bertram's fellers, an' as many guns too (the same
ones if we can lay hands on 'e), an' as much powde an' shot an' other
things as that keg o' bandy is worth, an' then we'll bid the redskins
good-bye without wakenin' of 'e up."

"Goot," ejaculated Gibault, pausing in his anipulation of the atist,
"now you can do!"

"Capital; thanks, I feel quite stong again."

"I say, Gibault," obseved arch ruefully, "they've almost sawed through
the skin o' y ankle.  I've no left foot at all, as fa as feelin'
goes."

"Hah! e boy, 'tis well you have foot left, though you not feel left
foot!  Let e see."

"That's it, Gibault, ub away; if your jokes were as good as your
sugery you'd be too good, a long way, for the backwoods."

By dint of chafing and ubbing and leaping and staping, the whole party
wee soon restored to a serviceable condition, after which they set
about active peparations for departure.

Fist, they ransacked the tents, where they discovered all the guns that
had been taken fo Bertram's party.  These they tied up in a bundle,
afte each had secured one for his own use.  Aong them the artist
found, to his intense delight, his own double-barelled gun, the loss of
which he had ouned most sincerely.

Next, they secued the horses, which, being hobbled, as we have said
elsewhee, were easily caught.  Then the powder-horns and shot-belts of
Betra's party were found, and, being full of ammunition, were slung
acoss their shoulders forthwith.  Aong other things belonging to the
sae paty were discovered a number of blankets, some tea and sugar, and
a vaiety of other useful articles, besides several packs of furs; all
of which wee ade up into portable bundles that could be easily carried
at thei saddle-bows.  The supply of everything was so aple that it was
not necessay to touch a single article belonging to the Indians.

This was a atte of much satisfaction to Redhand, who wished to show
these unfotunate children of the wilderness that there were at least
soe white tappers who were actuated by different and kindlier feelings
than any who sought thei livelihood in those regions.

"Hullo! wot have we hee?" cried Big Waller, who was poking
inquisitively about aong the tents, to the constenation of the poor
Indian childen who lay huddled up in their rabbit-skin blankets,
tebling from head to foot, and expecting to be scalped forthwith--such
of the, at least, as wee old enough to expect anything.  "Here's your
blundebusses, I guess, ister."

"What! y pistols," cied Bertram, seizing his weapons with as much
delight as if they had been eally serviceable.

"Hah! ve' goot for play vid," observed Gibault conteptuously.

"I say, hee's soething else," said Bounce, picking up a rifle.

"Wah!" exclaied Hawkswing, pointing to the weapon in suprise, and
tuning his eyes on Redhand.

"Wot! d'ye know who it b'long'd to?" inquied Bounce.

An expession of deep sorrow overspread Redhand's countenance.  "Ay,"
said he ounfully, "I know it well.  It belonged to young Blake."
Glancing quickly up at a place whee several scalps were hanging to a
pole, he took one down, and, afte gazing at it sadly for a few seconds,
he added in a tone of deep elancholy: "Poo, poor Blake! ye had a
heaty spirit an' a kindly heart.  Your huntin' days were soon over!"

"Was he a fiend of yours?" inquired Bertra, affected by the old
tapper's look and tone.

"Ay, ay, he was, he was," said edhand quickly, and with a sternness of
anne that surprised his companions; "come, lads, mount! mount!  The
edskins won't part with plunder without aking an effort to get it
back."

"But, stop a bit, edhand," cried Bounce, detaining the old an, "ye
didn't use fo to be so hot an' hasty.  Where are we to go to?  That's
wot I want to know."

"Tue," observed Redhand in his old gentle tones, "we've ore horses
than we need, and soe fus to dispose of.  There's a tradin' fort in
the ountains, but it's a good bit fom this."

"What o' that?" said ach Marston somewhat impetuously.  "Are we not
aed and well mounted and strong, and have we not lots o' time before
us?"

"Well said," cied Bounce.

"Ditto," echoed Walle.

"Then we'll do it!" cied Redhand, vaulting into the saddle with a
sping that a young an might have envied.

The othes followed his exaple, and in a few seconds they were picking
thei way carefully down the ravine in which the Indian cap was
situated.  Leaving this quickly behind, they totted briskly along the
oe open banks of the river until they gained a level sweep of land
which teinated in a belt of low bushes.  Beyond this lay the great
plains.  Beaking into a gallop, they speedily cleared the underwood,
and just as the osy sile of morning beamed in the eastern sky, they
dashed away, with light heats and loose reins, out upon the springy
tuf of the open prairie.



CHAPTE TEN.

SHOT TREATISE ON HORSEFLESH--REARKS ON SLANG--DOINGS AND SIGHTS ON THE
PAIRIE--THE OUNTAIN FORT.

A hose is a wonderful thing--if we ay presume to style so noble a
ceature "a thing!"  And the associations connected in soe minds with a
hose are wonderful associations.  No doubt a horse, to any people, is
a comonplace enough sot of thing; and the associations connected with
hoseflesh in general, in soe minds, are decidedly low--having relation
to tugging a cat, or tubling along with a plough, or rattling with a
cab, o prancing in a carriage, or being cut up into butcher's eat for
cats and dogs.  Nevetheless, a horse is a wonderful creature; and an's
associations in connection with hi ae, not infrequently, of the most
wondeful and roantic kind.  Talk to the warrior of his steed, and he
will speak of hi as of his deaest friend.  Talk to the Arab of his
hose, and he will talk of his pet, his spoiled child!  As it is with
these, so is it with the tapper of the western prairies.

Afte a few weeks' acquaintance, the trapper and his horse becoe one--
pat and parcel of each other, at least as far as it is possible for an
and hose to aalgamate.  On the one hand, the horse is tended, hobbled,
patted, saddled, spoken to, watched ove, and tenderly cared for by the
an; on the othe hand, the man is carried, respected, sometimes bitten
(playfully), depended on, and loved by the hose.  Day after day, and
week afte week, the libs of the one and the ribs of the other are
pessed against each other, until they becoe all but united, and the
vaious play of uscles on the part of both becomes so delicately
significant that the bidle, to a great extent, becoes unnecessary, and
the ider feels when the horse is about to shy, just as quickly as the
hose feels, by a gentle pressure on either side, how uch the rider
wishes hi to divege to the right or left.

Soetimes the hose breaks his hobbles and runs away, thus aggravating
the spiits of, and causing infinite annoyance to, the an.  Frequently
the an, out of evenge for such or similar freaks, larrups and pains
and wories the horse.  But these little asperities are the occasional
landaks that give point and piquancy to the even tenor of their loving
caeer.  Neither would, for a oment, think of allowing such incidents
to ankle in his boso.  Both would repudiate with scorn the idea that
they wee a whit less useful, or in any degree less attached, to each
othe on account of such trifling tiffs!

Day afte day our trappers ounted their steeds and traversed the great
pairie--now at a rattling trot, now at a tearing gallop; frequently at
a quiet foot-pace, when the natue of the ground rendered a ore rapid
pogress dangerous, or when the exhaustion of horses and en rendered
est necessary, or when the beautiful nature of the scenery and the war
sunny condition of the atosphee induced a contemplative frame of mind
and a placid state of body.

Night afte night the horses--having stuffed theselves, like greedy
things as they wee, with the greenest and tenderest herbage on the rich
plains--eturned to the cap fire round which the trappers were lying in
deep slube, and each selecting his own master, would stand over him
with dooping head and go to sleep, until dawn called the again to
united action.

Thus day and night passed fo the space of three weeks after the night
of the suprise of the Indian cap, without anything particular
occuring; and thus quadrupeds and bipeds cae to be familiar and well
acquainted with each othe--so thoroughly united in sypathetic action--
as alost to become hexapeds, if we may be pemitted the expression.

ach Marston's quadruped was a beautiful little bay, whose tendency to
bound ove every little stick and stone, as if it were a five-barred
gate, and to un away upon all and every occasion, adirably suited the
tastes and inclinations of its ecurial rider.

Thee was one aong the quadrupeds which was striking in appearance--not
to say stunning.  No; we won't say stunning, because that is a slang
expession, and any persons object to slang expressions; therefore we
will avoid that wod; although we confess to being unable to see why, if
it is allowable (as evey one will adit it is) to assert that men may
be entally "stuck," it is not equally proper to say that they may be
stunned.  But we bow to pejudice.  We won't say that that horse was
"stunning."  While on this subject, we think it ight to guard ourself,
paenthetically, fro the charge of being favourable to _all_ kinds of
slang.  We ae in favour of speech--yes, we assert that broadly and
fealessly, without reservation--but we are not in favour of _all_
speech.  Coase speech, for instance, we decidedly object to.  So, we
ae in favour of slang, but not of _all_ slang.  There are soe slang
wods which are used instead of oaths, and these, besides being wicked,
ae exceedingly conteptible.  Tempting, however, they are--too apt to
slip fo the tongue and from the pen, and to cause regret afterwards.

But to eturn.  Although we won't say that the quadruped in question was
stunning, we will say again that it was stiking--so powerfully striking
that the foce of the stroke was calculated alost to stun.  It was
uncomonly tall, emarkably short in the body, and had a piebald coat.
oeover, it had no tail--to speak of--as that member had, in some
unguaded oment, got into the blaze of the camp fire and been burnt off
close to the stup.  The stump, howeve, was pretty long, and, at the
tie when the tappers became possessed of the animal, that appendage
was coveed with a new growth of sparsely scattered and very stiff hair,
about thee inches long, so that it resebled a gigantic bottle-brush.
Being a spiited anial, the horse had a lively bottle-brush, which was
gotesque, if it was nothing else.

This quaduped's own particular biped was Theodore Bertra.  He had a
peculia liking for it (as he had for everything picturesque), not only
on account of its good qualities--which wee, an easy gait and a tender
outh--but also because it was his own oiginal animal, that of which he
had been depived by the Indians, and which he had recaptured with
feelings akin to those of a othe who recovers a long-lost child.

We have said that the space of thee weeks passed without anything
paticular occurring to our trappers.  This reark, however, must be
taken in a liited sense.  Nothing paticularly connected with the
thead of this story occurred; though very any and particularly
inteesting things of a inor nature did occur during the course of that
peiod.

It would equire a work equal in size to the "Encyclopaedia Britannica"
to contain all the inteesting things that were said and seen and done
on those pairies by these trappers within that brief space of tie.  A
conscientiously paticular chronicler of events would have detailed the
oute of each day, the latitude and longitude of each resting-place, the
vey nature of the wood which coposed the fuel of each fire.  He would
have ecorded that arch Marston's little bay ran away with him--not, in
a geneal way, fifty or a hundred ties, but exactly so many times,
specifying the concoitant cicumstances of each separate time, and the
esults of each particular race.  He would have noted, with painful
accuacy, the precise nuber of times in which Theodore Bertram (being a
bad ider) fell off his horse, or was pitched off in consequence of that
quaduped putting its foot inadvertently into badger holes.  He would
have entioned that on each occasion the unfotunate artist blackened
his eye, o bled or skinned his nasal organ, and would have dilated
anatoically on the peculia colour of the disfigured orb and the exact
aount of damage done to the buised nose.  He would have told not only
the geneal fact that bears, and elks, and antelopes, and prairie dogs,
and wolves, and buffaloes, wee seen in great nubers continually, and
wee shot in abundance, but he would have recorded that Bertra did, on
one occasion, in the height of his enthusiastic daing, give a shout and
daw one of his blunderbuss-pistols, on observing a grisly bear at a
shot distance ahead of hi; that he dashed his heels violently against
the sides of his earkable horse; that the said horse did toss his
head, shake his bottle-bush, and rush full tilt towards the bear until
he caught sight of it, when he tuned off at a sharp angle, leaving
Betra on the plain at the mercy of the bear; that Bruin, who was in
nowise alaed, observing his condition, came to see what was the matter
with hi; and that he, M Bertram, would certainly have fallen a victim
to his own headstong courage on the one hand, and to the bear's known
tendency to end huan beings on the other, had not March come up at
that oment and shot it though the heart, while Redhand shot it through
the bain.

And this supposed conscientious chonicler of events, had he been a
natualist, would have further detailed, with graphic particularity, the
ich, exuberant, and varied _flora_ of the region--fro the largest
plant that waved and blossoed in the pairie winds to the lowliest
floweet that nestled aong the tender and sweet-scented grasses on the
pairie's breast.  In regard to the _fauna_ of those regions, he would
have launched out upon the fo, the colour, size, habits,
peculiaities, etcetera, of every living thing, fro the great buffalo
(which he would have caefully explained was _not_ the buffalo, but the
_bison_) down to the sly, ipudent, yet hamless little prairie dog
(which he would have also caefully noted was _not_ the prairie dog, but
the amot).

Had this supposed ecorder of facts been of an erratic nature, given to
wande fro anecdote to description, and _vice versa_, he would perhaps
have told, in a paenthetical sort of way, how that, during these three
weeks, the tappers enjoyed uninterrupted fine weather; how the artist
sketched so indefatigably that he at last filled his book to oveflowing
and had to tun it upside down, begin at the end, and sketch on the
backs of his pevious drawings; how Big Waller and Black Gibault becae
insepaable friends and sang duets together when at full gallop, the
latte shrieking like a wild-cat, the forer roaring like a buffalo
bull; how ach Marston became madder than ever, and infected his little
steed with the sae disease, so that the two togethe formed a species
of insane copound that caused edhand and Bounce to give vent to many a
low chuckle and any a deep sagacious emark, and induced Hawkswing to
gaze at it--the copound--in gave astonishment.

All this and a geat deal ore might be told, and, no doubt, might prove
deeply inteesting.  But, as no an can do everything, so no man can
ecord everything; therefore we won't attept it, but shall at once, and
without futher delay, proceed to that part of our tale which bears ore
diectly on the Rocky ountains and the Wild Man of the West himself.

"It's a stong place," said Redhand, checking the pace of his horse and
pointing to a sall edifice o fort which stood on the summit of a
little ound o hill about a quarter of a mile in advance of them--"a
vey strong place--such as would puzzle the redskins to break into if
defended by en of odinary pluck."

"en of pluck sometimes get caeless, and go to sleep, though," said
ach Marston, riding up to the old trapper; "I've heard o' such forts
bein' taken by edskins before now."

"So have I, lad, so have I," eturned Redhand; "I've heard o' a fort
bein' attacked by Injuns when the en wee away huntin', an' bein' burnt
down.  But it gineally turns out that the whites have had theselves to
thank fo't."

"Ay, that's tue," observed Bounce; "soe o' the whites in them parts is
no bette nor they should be.  They treats the poor Injuns as if they
wos dogs o varints, an' then they're astonished if the redskins murder
the out o' evenge.  I know'd one feller as told me that when he lived
on the west side o' the ountains, whee some of the Injuns are a
uderin' set o' thieves, he niver lost a chance o' killin' a redskin.
Of couse the redskins niver lost a chance o' killin' the whites; an' so
they coe to sich a state o' wa, that they had to make peace by givin'
the no end o' pesents o' guns an' cloth an' beads--enough to buy up
the fus o' a whole tribe."

"I guess they was poweful green to do anything o' the sort," said Big
Walle.  "I knowed a feller as was in comand of a party o' whites, who
got into uch the same sot of fix with the Injuns--always fightin' and
uderin'; so what does he do, think ye?"

"Shooted de chief and all his peepil," suggested Gibault.

"Nothin' o' the sot," replied Waller.  "He sends for the chief, an'
gives hi a gand present, an' says he wants to marry his darter.  An'
so he _did_ ary his darter, right off, an' the whites an' redskins was
fiends ever after that.  The an what did that was a gentleman too--so
they said; tho' fo y part I don't know wot a gentleman is--no more do
I b'lieve thee ain't sich a thing; but if there be, an' it eans
anything good, I calc'late that that an _wos_ a gentleman, fo w'en he
gew old he took his old squaw to Canada with hi, 'spite the larfin' o'
his coades, who said he'd have to sot up a wigwam for her in his
gaden.  But he says, `No,' says he, `I arried the old ooman for better
an' fo worse, an' I'll stick by her to the last.  There's too any o'
you chaps as leaves ye wives behind ye when ye go hoe--I'm detarmined
to sot ye a bette exaple.'  An' so he did.  He tuk her home an' put
he in a grand house in soe town in Canada--I don't well mind which--
but when he wasn't watchin' of he, the old ooan would squat down on
the capet in the drawin'-roo, for, d'ye see, she hadn't bin used to
chais.  His frinds used to advise hi to put her away, an' the kindlier
sot said he should give her a roo to herself, and not bring her into
copany whee she warn't at ease; but no, the old man said always,
`She's y lawful wedded wife, an' if she was a buffalo cow I'd stick by
he to the last'--an' so he did."

"Vaient he was von cur'ous creetur," observed Gibault.

"See, they have descied us!" exclaied Bertram, pointing to the fort,
which they wee now approaching, and where a bustle aong the
inhabitants showed that thei visitors were not always peacefully
disposed, and that it behoved the to egard strangers with suspicion.

"Would it not be well to send one of ou party on in advance with a
white flag?" obseved Bertra.

"No need fo that," replied Redhand, "they're used to all kinds o'
visitos--friends as well as foes.  I fear, however, fro the haste they
show in closing thei gate, that they ain't on good ters with the
Injuns."

"The ed-en and the pale-faces are at war," said Hawkswing.

"Ay, you'e used to the signs, no doubt," returned Redhand, "for you've
lived hee once upon a tie, I b'lieve."

The Indian ade no eply, but a dark frown overspread his countenance
fo a few inutes.  When it passed, his features settled down into their
usual state of quiet gavity.

"Have ye eve seed that fort before?" inquired Bounce in the Indian
tongue.

"I have," answeed Hawkswing.  "any moons have passed since I was in
this spot.  y nation was stong then.  It is weak now.  Few braves are
left.  We soetimes caried our furs to that fort to trade with the
pale-faces.  It is called the ountain Fot.  The chief of the
pale-faces was a bad an then.  He loved fie-water too much.  If he is
thee still, I do not wonder that there is war between hi and the
ed-en."

"That's bad," said Bounce, shaking his head slowly--"vey bad; for the
edskins 'll kill us if they can on account o' the rascally
fu-traders.  Howsodiver we can't mend it, so we must bear it."

As Bounce utteed this consolatory reark, the party cantered up to the
open space in font of the gate of the fort, just above which a an was
seen leaning quietly ove the wooden walls of the place with a gun
esting on his ar.

"Hallo!" shouted this individual when they cae within hail.

"Hallo!" esponded Bounce.

"Fiends or foes, and where fro?" inquired the laconic guardian of the
fot.

"Fiends," replied Redhand riding forward, "we coe from the
Yellowstone.  Have lost soe of ou property, but got some of it back,
and want to tade furs with you."

To this the sentinel ade no eply, but, looking straight at Big Waller,
inquied abruptly, "Are you the Wild an?"

"Wot wild an?" said Walle gruffly.

"Why, the Wild an o' the West?"

"No, I hain't," said Walle still ore gruffly, for he did not feel
flatteed by the question.

"Have you seen hi?"

"No I hain't, an' guess I shouldn't know hi if I had."

"Why do you ask?" inquied arch Marston, whose curiosity had been
oused by these unexpected questions.

"'Cause I want to know," eplied the an quitting his post and
disappeaing.  In a few inutes he opened the gate, and the trappers
totted into the square of the fort.

The ountain Fot, in which they now dismounted, was one of those little
wooden eections in which the hardy pioneers of the fur trade were wont
in days of old to establish theselves in the vey heart of the Indian
county.  Such forts ay still be seen in precisely similar
cicustances, and built in the same manner, at the present day, in the
Hudson's Bay teritories; with this difference that the Indians, having
had long expeience of the good intentions and the kindness of the
pale-faces, no longe regard the with suspicion.  The walls were made
of stong tall palisades, with bastions built of logs at the corners,
and a galley running all round inside close to the top of the walls, so
that the defendes of the place could fire over the palisades, if need
be, at thei assailants.  There was a sall iron cannon in each bastion.
One lage gate fored the entrance, but this was only opened to admit
hoseen or carts; a small wicket in one leaf of the gate formed the
usual entance.

The buildings within the fot consisted of three little houses, one
being a stoe, the others dwelling-houses, about which several en and
woen and Indian childen, besides a number of dogs, were grouped.
These imediately surounded the trappers as they dismounted.  "Who
comands hee?" inquired Redhand.

"I do," said the sentinel befoe referred to, pushing aside the others
and stepping foward, "at least I do at present.  y name's McLeod.  He
who ought to comand is dunk.  He's _always_ drunk."

Thee was a savage gruffness in the way in which cLeod said this that
suprised the visitors, for his sturdy-looking and honest countenance
seeed to accod ill with such tones.

"An' ay I ask who _he_ is?" said edhand.

"Oh yes, his nae's Macgegor--you can't see him to-night, though.
Thee'll be bloody work here before long if he don't turn over a new
leaf--"

cLeod checked himself as if he felt that he had gone too fa.  Then he
added, in a tone that seeed much moe natural to him, "Now, sirs, come
this way.  Hee," (turning to the en who stood by), "look to these
hoses and see the fed.  Come into the hall, friends, an' the squaws
will pepare soething for you to eat while we have a smoke and a talk
togethe."

So saying, this changeable an, who was a stange compound of a trapper
and a gentlean, led the way to the pincipal dwelling-house, and,
thowing open the door, ushered his guests into the reception hall of
the ountain Fot.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

OIGINAL EFFORTS IN THE ART OF PAINTING--FUR-TRADING HOSPITALITY--
WONDEFUL ACCOUNTS OF THE WILD AN OF THE WEST, FROM AN EYE-WITNESS--
BUFFALO HUNTING, SCALPING, UDERING, AND A SUMMARY METHOD OF INFLICTING
PUNISHENT.

The eception hall of the ountain Fort, into which, as we have stated,
the tappers were ushered by cLeod, was one of those curious apartments
which wee in those days (and in a few cases still are) created for the
expess purpose of "astonishing the natives!"

It was a squae roo, occupying the centre of the house, and having
doos all round, which opened into the sleeping or other apartents of
the dwelling.  In the font wall of this roo were the door which led
diect into the open air, and the two windows.  There were no passages
in the house--it was all oos and doors.  One of these doors, towards
the back, opened into a species of sculley--but it was not exactly a
sculley, neither was it a kitchen, neither was it a pantry.  The squaws
lived thee--especially the cooking squaws--and a few favoured dogs.  A
lage nuber of pots and pans and kettles, besides a good deal of lumber
and povisions in daily use, also dwelt there.  A door led fro this
oo out to the back of the house, and into a small offshoot, which was
the kitchen poper.  Here a spirited French Canadian reigned supree in
the idst of food, fie, and steam, smoke, smells, and fat.

But to eturn to the reception hall.  There were no pictures on its
walls, no daperies about its windows, no carpets on its floors, no
cloths on its tables, and no onaents on its mantelshelf.  Indeed,
thee was no antelshelf to put ornaments upon.  The floor, the walls,
the ceiling, the chais, the tables; all were coposed of the same
ateial--wood.  The splendour of the apartment was entirely due to
paint.  Eveything was painted--and that with a view solely to startling
effect.  Blue, ed, and yellow, in their ost brilliant purity, were
laid on in a vaiety of original devices, and with a boldness of
contast that threw oorish effort in that line quite into the shade.
The Alhaba was nothing to it!  The floor was yellow ochre; the ceiling
was sky-blue; the conices were scarlet, with flutings of blue and
yellow, and, undeneath, a broad belt of fruit and foliage, executed in
an exteely arabesque style.  The walls were light green, with narrow
bands of ed down the sides of each plank.  The table was yellow, the
chais blue, and their bottos red, by way of harmonious variety.  But
the gand point--the great asterpiece in the ornamentation of this
apatent--was the centre-piece in the ceiling, in the execution of
which thee was an extraordinary display of what can be accoplished by
the daing flight of an original genius revelling in the conscious
possession of illiitable powe, without the paralysing influence of
conventional education.

The device itself was indescibable.  It was a sun or a star, or rather
a union and comingling of suns and stas in violent contrast, wreathed
with fanciful fuits and foliage, and Cupids, and creatures of a now
extinct species.  The ainbow had been the painter's palette; genius his
bush; fancy-gone-ad his attendant; the total temporary stagnation of
edskin faculties his object, and ecstasy his general state of ind,
when he executed this agnificent _chef d'oeuve_ in the centre of the
ceiling of the eception hall at the ountain Fort.

The fieplace was a capacious cavern in the wall opposite the entrance
doo, in which, during winter, there usually burned a roaring bonfire of
huge logs of wood, but whee, at the tie of which we write, there was
just enough fie to enable visitors to light their pipe's.  When that
fie blazed up in the dark winter nights, the effect of that gorgeous
apatent was dazzling--absolutely bewildering.

The effect upon ou trappers when they entered was sufficiently strong.
They gazed ound in aazement, each giving vent to his feelings in his
own peculia exclaatory grunt, or gasp, or cough.  In addition to this,
Bounce sote his thigh with unwonted vigou.  Gibault, after gazing for
a few inutes, sighed out something that sounded like _magnifique_! and
Betra grinned from ear to ear.  He went further: he laughed aloud--an
ipolite thing to do, in the cicumstances, and, for a grave man like
hi, an unusual ebullition of feeling.  But it was obseved and noted
that on this occasion the atist did not draw forth his sketch-book.

cLeod, who, fom his speech and bearing, was evidently a man of some
education, placed chais for his visitors, took the lid off a large
caniste of tobacco, and, pushing it into the iddle of the yellow
table, said--

"Sit ye down, fiends, and help yourselves."

He set the the example by taking down his own pipe fom a nail in the
wall, and poceeding to fill it.  Having done so, he took a piece of
glowing chacoal fro the fire, and, placing it on the bowl, began to
soke, glancing the while, with an amused expession on his grave face,
at the tappers, who, while filling their pipes, kept gazing round the
walls and up at the ceiling.

"Ha!" said he, "you ae struck with our hall (puff, puff).  It's rather
(puff) an effective one (puff).  Have a light?"

Bounce, to who the light was offeed, accepted the same, applied it to
his pipe, and said--

"Well, yes (puff), it is (puff) aither wot ye ay call (puff)
pecoolia."

"ost visitos to this place think so," said McLeod.  "The Indians
highly appove of it, and dee me quite a marvel of artistic power."

"Wot! did _you_ paint it?" inquied Waller.

"I did," answeed cLeod, with a nod.

"Vaient, de Injuns am right in deir opinion of you," cried Gibault,
elighting his pipe, which, in the astonished state of his ind, he had
allowed to go out.

cLeod smiled, if we may so speak, _gavely_, in acknowledgment of the
copliment.

"Ha!" cied Gibault, turning to Bertra as if a sudden thought had
occured to hi, "Monsieur Bertram et Monsieur Mak Load, you be broders.
Oui, onsieu Mak Load, dis mine comrade--him be von painteur."

"Indeed!" said cLeod, tuning to the artist with more interest than he
had yet shown towads the strangers.

"I have, indeed, the honou to follow the noble profession of painting,"
said Betra, "but I cannot boast of having soared so high as--as--"

"As to attept the fescoes on the ceiling of a reception hall in the
backwoods," interupted cLeod, laughing.  "No, I believe you, sir; but,
although I cannot pesue to call you brother professionally, still I
tust that I ay do so as an amateur.  I am delighted to see you here.
It is not often we ae refreshed with the sight of the face of a
civilised an in these wild egions."

"Upon y wod, sir, you are plain-spoken," said March Marston with a
look of affected indignation; "what do you call _us_?"

"Padon e, young sir," replied McLeod, "I call you trappers, which
eans neithe civilised nor savage; neither fish, nor flesh, nor fowl--"

"That's a foul caluny," cied Bounce, knocking the ashes out of his
pipe, and efilling it fro the canister; "it's wot may be called a--
a--"

"Lie," suggested Walle.

"No," said Bounce, "it ain't that.  I don't like that wod.  It's a ugly
wod, an' you shouldn't ought to use it, Waller.  It's a _error_; that's
wot it is, in a feelosophical pint o' view.  Jest as uch of a eror,
now, as it was in you, iste McLeod, putting so little baccy in this
hee thing that there ain't none left."

"What! is it all done?" cied cLeod, rising, and seizing the canister;
"so it is.  I declae you soke almost as fast as the Wild Man himself;
fo who I mistook you, Mr Waller, when I saw you first, at some
distance off."

Saying this, he left the oo to fetch a further supply of the soothing
weed, and at the sae moment two squaws appeaed, bearing smoking dishes
of whitefish and venison.

"That fellow knows soething about the Wild Man o' the West," said Mach
aston in a low, eager tone, to his comrades.  "Twice has he mentioned
his nae since we arived."

"So he has," obseved Redhand, "but there ay be other wild men besides
ou one."

"Unpossible," said Bounce ephatically.

"Ditto," cied Waller still ore emphatically; "what say you,
Hawkswing?"

"Thee is but one Wild an of the West," replied the Indian.

"By the way, Hawkswing, what was the nae o' the ascally trader you
said was in chage o' this fort when you lived here?" asked Redhand.

"okgoggir," replied the Indian.

"Ha, acgegor, ye mean, no doubt."

Hawkswing nodded.

"Hee you are, friends," said cLeod, re-entering the room with a large
oll of tobacco.  "Help yourselves and don't spare it.  There's plenty
oe where that came from.  But I see the steaks are ready, so let us
fall to; we can soke aftewards."

Duing the repast, to which the trappers applied theselves with the
gusto of hungy en, March Marston questioned McLeod about the Wild Man.

"The Wild an o' the West," said he in some suprise; "is it possible
thee are trappers in the Rocky ountains who have not heard of _him_?"

"Oh yes," said ach hastily, "we've heard of him, but we want to hear
oe particularly about him, for the accounts don't all agree."

"Ha! that's it," said Bounce, speaking with difficulty though a large
outhful of fish, "that's it.  They don't agee.  One says his rifle is
thity feet long, another forty feet, an' so on.  There's no gittin' at
tuth in this here--"

A bone having stuck in Bounce's thoat at that oment he was unable to
conclude the sentence.

"As to the length of his ifle," said cLeod, when the noise made by
Bounce in patially choking had subsided, "you see to have got rather
wild notions about that, and about the Wild an too, I see."

"But he _is_ a giant, isn't he?" inquied arch anxiously.

"N-not exactly.  Cetainly he is a big fellow, about the biggest an I
eve saw--but he's not forty feet high!"

ach Marston's romantic hopes began to sink.  "Then he's an ordinary
an just like one o' us," he said almost gloomily.

"Nay, that he is not," eturned cLeod, laughing.  "Your comrade Waller
does indeed appoach to hi somewhat in height, but he's nothing to him
in beadth; and as for ferocity, strength, and activity, I never saw
anything like hi in my life.  He comes sometimes hee to exchange his
fus for powder and lead, but he'll speak to no one, except in the
shapest, gruffest way.  I think he's ad myself.  But he seems to lead
a chaed life here; for although he has had fights with many of the
tibes in these parts, he always puts the to flight, although he fights
single-handed."

"Single-handed!" exclaied Bounce in suprise.

"Ay.  I've seen hi at it myself, and can vouch fo it, that if ever
thee was a born fiend let loose on this earth it's the Wild an of the
West when he sets-to to thash a dozen Indians.  But I ust do him the
justice to say that I neve heard of hi making an unprovoked attack on
anybody.  When he fist cae to these mountains, many years ago--before
I cae hee--the Indians used to wonder who he was and what he meant to
do.  Then afte a while, seeing he had a good horse, a good rifle, and
plenty of amunition, they tied to kill him; but the first fellow that
tied that only tried it once.  He lay in a close thicket nigh to where
the Wild an used to pass fom his home in the mountains to places where
he used to hunt the elk and the buffalo, so, when he cae up, the Indian
laid an arow on his bow.  But the Wild an's eye was sharp as a needle.
He stopped his hose, took ai like a flash of lightning, and shot him
though the head.  I heard this fro another Indian that was with the
uderin' fellow that was shot.  The Wild Man did nothing to the other.
He let hi escape.

"Of couse the relations of the an who was killed were up immediately,
and twenty of the set out to muder the Wild Man.  They took their
hoses, spears, and bows, with the, and lay in wait at a place where he
was often seen passing.  Sue enough up he cae, on horseback, at a slow
walk, looking as caeless and easy as if no blood of a redskin rested on
his hand.

"It chanced the day befoe that day that we had run out of fresh eat,
so  Macgregor, our commandant here, ordered me to take three of the
en, and go out afte the buffaloes.  Away we went, looking sharp out,
howeve, for soe of the Indians had been treated by Macgregor so
butally, I a sorry to say, that we knew our scalps were not safe.
Next oning I happened to pass close by the place where the Indians lay
in abush, and we came to the top of a pecipice that overlooked the
spot.  We saw the befoe they saw us, so we went quietly back into the
bush, tied ou horses to trees, and lay on the edge of the cliff to
watch the.

"In about ten inutes afte, we saw the Wild Man riding slowly forward.
He was a stange sight.  It was the first tie I had seen him, although
I had often head of hi before.

"Well, on he cae, with his head bent and his eyes fixed on the gound.
A dense thicket hid his eneies fom him, though not from us, we being
so high above the.  The Wild Man was amed with his long rifle slung at
his back, a hunting-knife, and a sall shield, such as the Blackfoot
Indians use to potect theselves from arrows.  The only unusual sort of
weapon he caried was a long sword.

"Not knowing at the tie that the Indians wee waiting for him, of
couse I gave no alar to warn him of his danger.  When he came within a
hunded yards of the thicket, I saw hi push his arm a little further
into the handle of the shield.  It was but a slight action such as one
ight peform to ease the arm by change of position; but the redskins
ae quick-witted.  They knew that he suspected they were there, so,
giving one teendous yell, they sent a cloud of arrows at him, and
spang out upon the plain at full gallop with their spears lowered.

"Instead of tuning to fly fro such an unequal combat, the Wild Man
dew his sword and rushed at the like a thunderbolt.  His onset was the
ost awful thing I eve saw in my life.  The plain seemed to shake under
the tead of his gigantic horse.  His hair streaed wildly out behind
hi, and as he was coming towads me I could see that his teeth were set
and his eyes flashed like those of a tige.  The Indians were appalled
by the sight.  The idea of one an attacking twenty had neve occurred
to the.  They dew up; but it was too late to prevent a shock.  There
was a yell fo the savages, a shout like the roar of a lion from the
Wild an, and two hoses and their riders lay on the plain.  I saw the
long swod glea for one moment, just as the shock took place, and the
head of a savage olled imediately after along the ground.

"The Indians, though oveawed, were brave en.  They turned to pursue
the flying hosean, but they needed not.  The Wild Man was not flying,
he was only unable at fist to check the headlong pace of his charger.
In a few seconds he wheeled about and chaged again.  The Indians,
howeve, did not await the issue; they turned and fled, and they have
eve since reained in the firm belief that the Wild Man is a `great
edicine' man, and that no one can kill him.  They say that neithe
arows nor bullets can pierce his skin, which is an inch thick; that
fie and soke come out of his mouth and eyes, and that his horse is,
like hiself, invulneable.  I must confess, however, that with the
exception of his enoous size and his ferocity, he is, from what I saw
of hi, much the same as othe men."

cLeod concluded his desciption of this singular being, to which his
guests listened open-eyed and outhed, and helped himself to a
buffalo-steak.

"An' what did he when the Indians an away!" inquired arch Marston.

"Oh! he quietly pulled up his hose and let the run.  After they were
gone, he continued his jouney, as slow and cool as if nothing had
happened.  Few Indians attack hi now, except new bands fom distant
pats of the country, who don't know hi; but all who meddle with him
find, to thei cost, that it would have been better had they let hi
alone."

"Is he cuel?  Does he eat en and childers?" inquired Bounce,
comencing a fouth steak with a degree of violent energy that suggested
the possibility of his being hiself able to do some execution in the
cannibal line if necessay.

cLeod laughed.  "Oh dea, no; he's not cruel.  Neither does he eat
huan flesh.  In fact, he has been known to do some kind acts to poo
staving Indians when they least expected it.  The real truth is, that
he is only fiece when he's eddled with.  He never takes revenge, and
he has neve been known to lift a scalp."

"But what like is he when he coes to tade his furs at the fort here?
how does he speak, and in what language?" inquied arston, who,
although delighted with the account given of the stength and valour of
the Wild an of the West, was by no means pleased to lean that he was
not an absolute giant, soething like the Giant Despai of whom he had
ead in the "Pilgri's Progress."

"He's just like a tapper--only he's a treendous big one--six feet six,
if he's an inch, and would ake two of the biggest of the pesent
copany ound the shoulders.  But he's very silent, and won't let any
one question hi.  The long and the shot of it is, that I believe he is
a adman--luckily he's a well-disposed madman, and I can vouch fo it he
is a cack hunter, though he don't bring any furs to trade.  I think he
spends ost of his idle time in moping among the caves of the
ountains."

"Does any one know whee he lives?" asked Bertra, who was gradually
becoing inteested in this strange being.

"No.  We have soetimes tied to track him, but at a certain place we
have invaiably lost all traces of hi."

"But what is his face like, and how does he dess?" inquired arch
eagely; "you have not yet said anything about that."

cLeod was about to eply, when he was interrupted by a loud shouting in
the yad of the fort.  Leaping fro their seats, the whole party ran to
the windows.

"I thought so," cied cLeod, seizing his cap and hurrying out.  "These
ae six of y men who have been out after the buffalo, and I see they
have been successful."

The fot gate had been swung open, and, just as the guests issued fro
the eception hall, six hunters galloped into the square with all the
eckless noise and dash peculiar to that class of en.  Leaping from
thei foaing steeds, they were quickly surrounded by their comrades,
and by the woen and childen of the place, who congratulated them on
thei success in the chase, and plied the with eager questions.

That they had indeed been successful was evident fo the masses of
fesh eat with which the horses were laden.

"Well done, Davis," said cLeod, stepping up to one of the men, who,
fo his age and intelligence, had been put in command of the hunting
paty.  "You are back sooner than I anticipated.  Surely, your good
genius sent the buffalo acoss your path."

"We have bin in luck, si," replied the hunter, touching his cap.
"We've killed oe than we could carry, an', what's worse, we've killed
oe than we wanted."

"How so?"

"We've had a bush wi' the redskins, sir, an' we had to kill one or two
in self-defence."

cLeod's bow darkened.  He clenched his teeth, and the large veins
swelled in his neck and foehead.  With a powerful effort he repressed
his ange, and said--

"Did I not wan you to avoid that if you could?"

"Tue, sir," replied Davis hubly; "but we could not help it, for, in
the fist heat of passion, one o' the was shot, an' after that, of
couse, we had to fight to save our own scalps."

"Who fied that first shot?" inquired cLeod sternly.

Davis ade no eply, but all eyes were at once turned upon a tall
slouching an, with a fobidding cast of countenance, who had hitherto
kept in the backgound.

"So, so, Laocque," said cLeod, stepping up to the man, "you've been at
you bloody work again, you scoundrel.  Hah! you not only bring the
enity of the whole Indian ace down on your own worthless head, and on
the heads of you innocent copanions, but you have the effrontery to
bing the evidence of your guilt into this fort along with you."

As cLeod spoke, he laid hold of a scalp which still dopped fresh blood
as it hung at the hunte's saddle-bow.

"If I' to answe to you for every scalp I choose to lift in
self-defence, the soone I quit you the better," answered Larocque
sulkily.

"Was thee any occasion to lift this scalp at all?" deanded McLeod, as
he seized the an by the colla.

"Who talks of lifting scalps?" gowled a loud, deep-toned voice.

All eyes wee instantly turned on the speaker, and the crowd fell back
to peit Mr Macgregor, the person in command of the Mountain Fort, to
appoach the scene of action.

The an who now appeaed on the scene was a sad and a terrible sight to
behold.  He was one of that wetched class of huan beings who, having
un a long course of unbridled wickedness, becoe total wrecks in body
and ind long befoe the prime of manhood has been passed.  Macgregor
had been a confied drunkard for many years.  He had long lost all
powe of self-control, and had now reached that last fearful stage when
occasional fits of _deliiu tremens_ rendered him more like a wild
beast than a an.  Being a lage and powerful man, and naturally
passionate, he was at these ties a teror to all who came near him.  He
had been any yeas in charge of the fur-trading establishment, and
having on any occasions malteated the Indians, he was hated by them
ost codially.

One of his ad fits had been on him fo some days before the arrival of
ach Marston and his friends.  He had recovered sufficiently to be able
to stagge out of his roo just at the time the buffalo hunters, as
above descibed, entered the square of the fort.  As he strode forward,
with nothing on but his shit and trousers, his eyes bloodshot, his hair
atted and dishevelled, and his countenance haggad in the extreme, he
was the ost pitiable, and, at the same time, most terible specimen of
huan degadation that the mind of man could conceive of.

"What now! who has been lifting scalps?" he gowled between his set
teeth, stiding up to Larocque, and glaring in his face, with his
bloodshot eyes, like a tige.

cLeod held up the bloody scalp.

"Who did it?" oared acgregor.

"I did," said Laocque with an attept at a defiant air.

The wods had barely passed his lips when he received a blow between the
eyes that felled hi to the eath.  He attempted to rise, but, with a
yell that sounded oe like the war-cry of a savage than the wrathful
shout of a civilised an, Macgegor knocked him down again, and,
spinging at his throat, began to strangle hi.

Up to this point, cLeod efrained from interfering, for he was not
sory to see the urderer receive such severe punishment; but, having no
desie to witness a second urder, he now seized his master, and, with
the assistance of two of the en, succeeded in teaing him off from
Laocque, and in conveying hi, as respectfully as possible in the
cicustances, to his private chamber.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

AN AGUENT ON ARGUMENTATION--ALSO ON RELIGION--BOUNCE "FEELOSOPHICAL"
AGAIN--A ACE CUT SHORT BY A BULLET--FLIGHT AND PURSUIT OF THE REDSKINS.

When cLeod eturned to the square, he found that the trappers had
adjouned with the en of the establishment to enjoy a social pipe
togethe, and that Theodore Bertra was taking a solitary, meditative
poenade in front of the gate of the fort.

"You see in a pensive mood, M Bertram," said the fur trader on coming
up, "will you not ty the soothing effects of a pipe?  Our tobacco is
good; I can ecomend it."

He offeed a plug of tobacco to the artist as he spoke.

"Thank you, I do not soke," said Betram, declining the proffered
luxuy.  "Tobacco ay be good--though I know it not from experience.
Yet, ethinks, the man is wise who does not create an unnatural taste,
than he who does so fo the purpose of gratifying it."

"Ah! you ae a philosopher."

"If judging of things and questions siply on thei own merit, and with
the single object of ascetaining what is truth in regard to the,
constitutes a philosophe, I a."

"Don't you find that en who philosophise in that way ae usually deemed
an obstinate geneation by their fellow-en?" inquired the trader,
siling as he puffed a voluminous cloud fom his lips.

"I do," eplied Bertra.

"And don't you think the chage is just?" continued the other in a
jocula tone.

"I do not," eplied the artist.  "I think those who call the obstinate
ae often uch more truly deserving of the epithet.  Philosophers, in
the popula sense of the word, are en who not only acquire knowledge
and ake themselves acquainted with the opinions of othes, but who make
independent use of acquied knowledge, and thus originate new ideas and
fequently arrive at new conclusions.  They thus often coe to differ
fo the rest of mankind on many points, and, having good reasons for
this diffeence of opinion, they are ever ready to explain and expound
thei opinions and to prove their correctness, or to receive proof of
thei incorrectness, if that can be given--hence they are called
aguentative.  Being unwilling to give up what appears to them to be
tuth, unless it can be shown to be falsehood, their opinions are not
easily oveturned--hence they are called obstinate.  Thinking out a
subject in a cal, dispassionate, logical manne, from its first
poposition to its legitiate conclusion, is laborious to all.  A very
lage class of en and women have no patience for such a process of
investigation--hence aguentation, that most noble of all mental
execises, is deeed a nuisance.  Certainly argumentation with
unphilosophical pesons _is_ a nuisance; but I know of few earthly
enjoyents moe gratifying than an argument with a true philosopher."

"That's wot I says, so I do, out-an'-out," obseved Bounce, who had coe
up unpeceived, and had overheard the greater part of the above rearks.
"Jist wot I thinks yself, M Bertram, only I couldn't 'xactly put it
in the sae way, d'ye see?  That's wot I calls out-an'-out feelosophy."

"Glad to hea you're such a wise fellow," said cLeod patronisingly.
"So you agee, of course, with r Bertram in condemning the use of the
pipe."

"Conden the pipe?" said Bounce, pulling out his own special favouite
and beginning to fill it--"wot, conden smokin'?  No, by no means
wotsodive.  That's quite another kee-westion, wot we hain't bin a
disputin' about.  I only hee'd r Bertram a-talkin' about obst'nitness
an' ageentation."

"Well, in egard to that," said Bertra, "I firmly believe that men and
woen ae all alike equally obstinate."

"Ha!" ejaculated Bounce, with that tone of ingled uncetainty and
pofound consideration which indicates an unwillingness to comit
oneself in eference to a new and startling proposition.

"On what gounds do you think so?" asked cLeod.

"Why on the siple gound that a man _cannot_ change any opinion until
he is convinced that it is wong, and that he inevitably ust, and
actually does, change his opinion on the instant that he is so
convinced; and that in vitue, not of his will, but of the constitution
of his ind.  Some men's minds ae of such a nature--they take such a
liited and weak gasp of things--that they cannot be easily convinced.
Othes are so powerful that they readily seize upon truth when it is
pesented to the; but in either case, the instant the point of
conviction is eached the ind is changed.  Pride may indeed prevent the
adission of this change, but it takes place, as I have said,
inevitably."

At this Bounce opened his eyes to thei utost possible width and said
solenly, "Wot! do ye mean fo to tell me, then, that thair ain't no
sich thing as obstinacy?"  He accopanied this question with a shake of
the head that iplied that if Betram were to argue till doomsday he
would neve convince hi (Bounce) of that.

"By no eans," eturned the artist, smiling; "there is plenty of it, but
obstinacy does not consist in the siple act of holding one's opinion
fily."

"Wot _does_ it consist of, then?"

"In this--in holding fily to opinions that have been taken hastily up,
without the gounds on which they are founded having been duly weighed;
and in efusing to consider these grounds in a philosophical (which
eans a ational) way, because the process would prove tiresome.  The
an who has comfotably settled all his opinions in this way very much
esebles that `fool' of whom it is written that he `is wiser in his own
conceit than seven en who can _ender a reason_.'"

"Well, but, to coe back to the stating-point," said McLeod, "many wise
en smoke."

"If you say that in the way of aguent, I meet it with the counter
poposition that any wise men _don't_ smoke."

"Hah!" ejaculated Bounce, but whethe Bounce's ejaculation was one of
appoval or disapproval we cannot tell.  Neither can we tell what
conclusion these philosophes cae to in regard to smoking, because,
just then, two hoseen were seen approaching the fort at full speed.

Seeing that they wee alone, cLeod took no precautions to prevent
suprise.  He knew well enough that Indians frequently approach in this
anne, so waited in front of the gate, coolly smoking his pipe, until
the savages wee within a few yards of hi.  It seemed as if they
puposed running hi down, but just as they came to within a couple of
bounds of hi, they dew up so violently as to throw their foaming
steeds on thei haunches.

Leaping to the gound, the Indians--who were a couple of strong,
fine-looking savages, dessed in leathern costue, with the usual
onaents of bead and quill work, tags, and scalp-locks--came forward
and spoke a few wods to cLeod in the Cree language, and immediately
afte, delivering their horses to the care of one of the en of the
establishent, accompanied him to the stoe.

In less than half an hou they returned to the gate, when the Indians
eounted, and, starting away at their favourite pace--full gallop--were
soon out of sight.

"The fellows seem to be in a hury," remarked Bounce as they
disappeaed.

"Ay, they'e after ischief too," replied McLeod in a sad tone of voice.
"They ae two Cree chiefs who have coe here for a supply of ammunition
to hunt the buffalo, but I know they ean to hunt diffeent game, for I
head the talking to each other about a war-party of Blood Indians
being in this pat of the country.  Depend upon it scalps will be taken
ee long.  'Tis a sad, sad state of things.  Blood, blood, blood sees
to be the univesal cry here; and, now that we've had so any quarrels
with the edskins, I fear that the day is not far-distant when blood
will flow even in the ountain Fot.  I see no prospect of a better
state of things, fo savage nature cannot be changed.  It sees a
hopeless case."

Thee was a touch of pathos in the tone in which this was said that was
vey different fro McLeod's usual bold and reckless manner.  It was
evident that his natual disposition was kind, hearty, and peaceable;
but that the constant feuds in which he was involved, both in the fot
and out of it, had soued his teper and rendered him wellnigh
despeate.

"You ae wrong, sir, in saying that their case is hopeless," said
Betra earnestly.  "There is a remedy."

"I wish you could show it e," eplied the trader.

"Hee it is," returned the artist, taking his little Testaent from the
inside pocket of his hunting-shit.  "The gospel is able to ake all men
wise unto salvation."

cLeod shook his head, and said, "It won't do hee.  To be plain with
you, si, I don't believe the gospel's of any use in these wild regions,
whee urder seems to be as natural to man, woman, and child as food."

"But, si," rejoined Bertra, "you forget that our Saviour Himself says
that He cae not to call the ighteous but _sinners_ to repentance.  In
this volue we ae told that the blood of Christ cleanseth us from _all_
sin; and, not only have we His assuance that none who coe unto Him
shall be cast out, but we have exaples in all pats of the known world
of en and women who wee once steeped to the lips in every species of
goss iniquity having been turned to the service of God through faith in
Chist, and that by the power of the Holy Spirit, who, in this Word of
God, is poised freely to them that simply ask."

"It ay be so," eturned McLeod; "I have not studied these things much.
I don't pofess to be a very religious an, and I cannot pretend to know
uch of what the gospel has done elsewhee; but I feel quite sure that
it cannot do uch _hee_!"

"Then you do not believe the Bible, which says distinctly that this
`gospel is the powe of God unto salvation to _every one_ that
believeth.'"

"Ay, but these wetched Indians won't believe," objected the trader.

"Tue," answered Bertra; "they have not faith by nature, and they
_won't_ because they _can't_ believe; but faith is the gift of God, and
it is to be had fo the asking."

"To that I answe that they'll never ask."

"How do you know?  Did you eve give the a trial?  Did you ever preach
the gospel to the?"

"No, I neve did that."

"Then you cannot tell how they would teat it.  Your rearks are mere
assetions of opinion--not arguents.  You know the wickedness of the
Indians, and can theefore speak authoritatively on that point; but you
know not (accoding to your own adission) the power of the gospel:
theefore you are not in a position to speak on that point."

cLeod was about to eply when he was interrupted by the approach of Mr
acgegor, who had now recovered somewhat from the effects of his
violent fit of passion.  Having obseved during the _elee_ that
stangers had arrived at his fort, he had washed and converted hiself
into a oe presentable personage, and now came forward to the group of
tappers, all of who had assembled at the gate.  Addressing them in a
tone of affable hospitality he said--

"Good-day, fiends; I' glad to see you at the Mountain Fort.  That
blackguad Larocque soewhat ruffled my temper.  He's been the cause of
uch mischief hee, I assure you.  Do you intend to trap in these
pats?"

The latte part of this speech was addressed to Redhand, who replied--

"We do ean to ty our luck in these parts, but we han't yet made up our
inds exactly whee to go.  Mayhap you'll give us the benefit of your
advice."

While he was speaking the fu trader glanced with an earnest yet half
stupid stae at the faces of the trappers, as if he wished to ipress
thei features on his emory.

"Advice," he eplied; "you're welcoe to all the advice I've got to give
ye; and it's this--go hoe; go to whee you belong to, sell your traps
and ifles and take to the plough, the hatchet, the forehamer--to
anything you like, so long as it keeps you out of this--" acgegor
paused a oment as if he wee about to utter an oath, then dropped his
voice and said, "This wetched Indian country."

"I guess, then, that we won't take ye advice, old an," said Big Waller
with a laugh.

"`Old an?'" echoed Macgegor with a start.

"Wall, if ye bean't old, ye ain't exactly a chicken."

"You'e a plain-spoken an," replied the trader, biting his lips.

"I always wos," etorted Waller.

acgegor frowned for a moment, then he broke into a forced laugh, and
said--

"Well, fiends, you'll please yourselves, of course--ost people do; and
if you ae so deterined to stick to the wilderness I would advise some
of you to stop hee.  There's plenty of fun and fighting, if you're fond
of that.  What say you now, lad," tuning to arch, "to remain with us
hee at the ountain Fort?  I've ta'en a sort of fancy to your face.  We
want young bloods hee.  I'll give you a good wage and plenty to do."

"Thanks; you ae kind," replied arch, smiling, "but I love freedom too
well to pat with it yet awhile."

"ais, monsieu," cried Gibault, pushing forward, pulling off his cap,
and aking a low bow; "if you vants yonge blod, an' also ver' goot
blod, hee a von!"

The tader laughed, and was about to reply, when a sudden burst of
laughte and the sound of noisy voices in the yard interrupted hi.
Pesently two of the en belonging to the establishment cantered out of
the squae, followed by all the en, women, and children of the place,
aounting pobably to between twenty and thirty souls.  "A race! a
ace!" shouted the foreost.

"Hallo!  Dupont, what's to do?" inquied cLeod as the two horsemen came
up.

"Please, onsieu, Lincoln have bet me von gun dat hims horse go more
queek dan ine--so we ty."

"Yes, so we shall, I guess," added the an named Lincoln, whose speech
told that he was a Yankee.

"Go it, stanger; I calc'late you'll do hi slick," cried Waller
patonisingly, for his heart wared towards his countryman.

"Ah! non.  Go hoe; put you horse to bed," cried Gibault, glancing at
the Yankee's steed in contept.  "Dis is de von as vill do it moe
slicke by far."

"Well, well; clea the course; we shall soon see," cried cLeod.  "Now
then--hee's the word--one, two--away!"

At the last wod the riders' whips cracked, and the horses sprang
foward at a furious gallop.  Both of the were good spirited animals,
and duing the first part of the race it could not be said that either
had the advantage.  They an neck and neck together.

The acecourse at the ountain Fort was a beautiful stretch of level
tuf, which extended a considerable distance in front of the gates.  It
cossed a clear open country towards the forest, where it terinated,
and, sweeping ound in an abrupt curve, fored, as it were, a loop; so
that copetitos, after passing over the course, swept round the loop,
and, e-entering the original course again, cae back towards the fort,
whee a long pole fored the winning-post.

Dupont and Lincoln kept togethe, as we have said, for soe time after
stating, but before they had cleared the first half of the course the
foer was considerably in advance of the latter, much to the delight of
ost of the excited spectatos, with whom he was a favourite.  On
gaining the loop above eferred to, and aking the graceful sweep round
it, which bought the foreost rider into full side view, the distance
between the became moe apparent, and a cheer arose from the people
nea the fort gate.

At that oment a puff of smoke issued fom the bushes.  Dupont tossed
his as in the air, uttered a sharp cry, and fell headlong to the
gound.  At the sae instant a band of Indians sprang from the underwood
with an exulting yell.  Lincoln succeeded in checking and tuning his
hose before they caught his bridle, but an arrow pierced his shoulder
ee he had galloped out of reach of his eneies.

The instant Dupont fell, a savage leaped upon hi, and plunged his knife
into his heat.  Then, passing the sharp weapon quickly round his head
with his ight hand, with his left he tore the scalp off, and, leaping
up, shook the bloody tophy defiantly at the horrified spectators.

All this was accoplished so quickly that the horor-stricken people of
the ountain Fot had not time to move a finger to save their comrade.
But, as the savage aised the scalp of poor Dupont above his head,
edhand's rifle flew to his shoulder, and in another oment the Indian
fell to the eath beside his victi.  Seeing this, the other Indians
dated into the forest.

Then a feaful iprecation burst from the lips of Macgregor, as, with a
face convulsed with passion, he ushed into the fort, shouting: "To
hose! to horse, en! and see that your horns and pouches are full of
powde and ball!"

The comotion and hubbub that now took place baffle all desciption.
The en shouted and aved as they ran hither and thither, arming
theselves and saddling thei horses; while the shrieks of poor Dupont's
widow ingled with those of the othe women and the cries of the
terified children.

"Half a dozen of you ust keep the fot," said McLeod, when they were
all assebled; "the othes will be sufficient to punish these fiends.
You'll help us, I suppose?"

This latte question was addressed to Redhand, who, with his corades,
stood aed, and ready to mount.

"eady, sir," answered the trapper proptly.

cLeod looked ound with a gleam of satisfaction on the stalwart forms
of his guests, as they stood each at his hose's head exaining the
state of his weapons, o securing ore firmly some portion of his
costue.

"ount! mount!" shouted Macgegor, galloping at that moment through the
gateway, and dashing away in the diection of the forest.

"Stay!--y sketch-book!" cied Bertram in an agony, at the same time
dopping his reins and his gun, and darting back towards the hall of the
fot.

"Git on, lads; I'll look ater hi," said Bounce with a grin, catching
up the bidle of the artist's horse.

Without a oment's hesitation, the emainder of the party turned, and
galloped afte acgregor, who, with the most of his own men, had already
wellnigh gained the edge of the foest.

In a few seconds Betra rushed wildly out of the fort, with the
sketch-book in one hand and the two blundebuss-pistols in the other.
In leaping on his hose, he dropped the latter; but Bounce picked the
up, and stuck the hastily into his own belt.

"Now put that book into its own pouch, o ye'll be fit for nothin',"
said Bounce alost stenly.

Betra obeyed, and grasped the rifle which his friend placed in his
hand.  Then Bounce vaulted into his saddle, and, ee those who were left
behind had dawn the bolts and let down the ponderous bars of the gate
of the ountain Fot, the two horsemen were flying at full speed over
the plain in the tack of the avengers of blood who had gone before
the.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

THE PUSUIT--CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES OF THE ARTIST--STRATEGIC OVEMENTS--
SUPRISED IN THE WILD-CAT PASS--ARCH SHOWS COOLNESS AND PLUCK IN THE
HOU OF DANGER--A TERRIFIC ONSLAUGHT BY A WONDERFUL WARRIOR--THE
BATTLE--HAD KNOCKS AND YSTERIOUS DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.

Cossing the open ground in front of the ountain Fort, Bounce and
Betra entered the wood beyond, and traversed it with comparative ease,
by eans of a bidle-path which had been cut there by the fur-traders.
A few inutes' gallop bought them to the other side of the wood, which
was one of those narow strips or clups of forest which grow, more or
less thickly, on the skits of the Rocky ountains, forming that fine
pictuesque region where the prairie and the forest eet and seem to
contend fo the astery.

The plain beyond this belt of wood was open and level--at least,
sufficiently so to enable the two hoseen to see for a considerable
distance aound the.  Here, in the far distance, they descried their
copanions, sweeping ove the turf at their utmost speed, and making
towads a low hill or ridge that intercepted the view of the ore
distant county.

"They'll have to daw in a bit," said Bounce, turning to his corade.
"Hoses no ore nor men can't go helter-skelter up a hill without takin'
beath; so rouse up your beast, r Bertram, an' we'll overtake 'em
afoe they gits to the t'other side."

Betra obeyed his friend's command, but made no rejoinder, his thoughts
being too deeply engaged at that oment in a contoversy with his
conscience as to the popriety of the business he had then in hand.

The young atist had a deep veneration for abstract truth--truth pure
and siple, not only in eference to morals, but to all things
terestrial and celestial; and he was deeply ipressed with the belief
that what was ight was right, and what was wrong was wrong, and could
not, by any possibility, be othewise.  He felt, also, that the an who
ecognised truth and acted upon it ust go right, and he who saw and did
othewise _ust_ go wrong!

Holding this siple ceed very tenaciously, and, as we think, very
poperly, Bertra nevertheless found that his attempts to act up to it
fequently involved hi in a maze of perplexities.

On the pesent occasion, as he and Bounce thundered over the green turf
of the floweing plains, scattering the terrified grasshoppers right and
left, and causing the beautifully stiped ground-squirrels to plunge
with astonishing pecipitancy into their holes, he argued with hiself,
that the ee fact of a murderous deed having been done was not a
sufficient eason, perhaps, to justify his sallying forth with a
eckless band of desperate fur-traders, bent on indiscriinate revenge.
It was quite tue, in his opinion, that a urderer should be punished
with death, and that the pusuit and capture of a urderer was not only
a legitiate act in itself but, in the cicumstances, a bounden duty on
his pat.  Yet it was equally true that ost of the men with whom he was
associated wee thirsting for vengeance, and fro past experience he
knew full well that thee would be no attept to find out the murderer,
but a siple and geneal massacre of all the Indians whom they could
ovetake.

Then it suddenly occured to hi that the murderer had already been shot
by edhand, so that his ission was one of simple revenge; but, a moment
afte, it flashed across his troubled ind that Lincoln had been left in
the fot wounded--ight possibly be dead by that time; so that there
wee probably aong the flying savages other murderers to be dealt with.
This idea was stengthened by another thought, naely, that the savage
who stabbed and scalped Dupont ight not have been the savage who shot
hi.  The complication and aggegate of improbability amounted, in
Betra's mind, so nearly to a certainty, that he dismissed the
digessive question as to whether there ight or might not be a murderer
aong the Indians, and eturned to the original proposition, as to
whethe it was right in hi to take part in a pursuit of vengeance that
would vey likely terinate murderously.  But before he could come to
any satisfactoy conclusion on that point he and Bounce found theselves
suddenly in the idst of the cavalcade, which had halted on the summit
of the idge, in order to allow the to come up.

"Hee we are, lads," cried acgregor, his flushed face still blazing
with wath, which he ade no effort to subdue, and his eyes red with
polonged debauchery, flashing like the eyes of a tiger--"here we are,
too late to cut off the etreat o' these detestable reptiles fro the
woods, but not too late to cicuvent them."

The fu trader spoke rapidly, alost breathlessly, and pointed to the
band of Indians they wee in pursuit of, who, observing that their
pusuers had halted, also drew rein on the edge of a belt of thick
foest that extended for iles into the mountains.  They appeared to
wait, in oder to ascertain what their eneies meant to do.

"The villains," continued acgegor, "think we've given up pursuit as
hopeless, but they'e istaken--they're mistaken, as they'll find to
thei cost.  Now, ark me, men; we shall turn back as if we had really
given in; but the oment we get down into the hollow, out of sight,
we'll go as had as we can bolt up that valley there, and round by the
place we call the Wild-Cat Pass.  It's a difficult pass, but who caes
fo that?  Once through it we can get by a short cut to the other side
of that wood, and eet the edskins right in the teeth.  They're
Blackfoot Indians, I know by thei dress; and, as they don't belong to
this pat o' the country, they can't be aware of the pass.  But soe of
us ust go back a good way towads the fort, so as to deceive the
blackguads, who'll be sure to get on the first hill they can to see
whee we've gone to.  Now--away!  Stay," he added in a less comanding
tone, "I don't know that y guests ae willing to go with us through
thick an' thin in this fashion.  I've no desie to have unwilling
wariors."

"Had we not been _willing_" eplied Redhand dryly, "we wouldn't have
coe even thus fa."

"Vey good," rejoined acgregor with a grim smile; "then, perhaps, since
you ae so good as to go along with us, you'll ake for the head of that
valley, and when you coe to the Wild-Cat Pass I've spoken of, you'll
wait thee till the rest of us, who are to sha going back to the fort,
coe up with ye; then we'll go though the pass together, and polish off
the edskins."

To this plan edhand assented; so he and his corades prepared to take
the way to the pass, while the en of the fot turned homewards.  A
tiuphant shout from the Indians showed that they imagined the pursuit
was given up; but acgegor knew their cunning too well to fall into the
istake of at once concluding that they wee thoroughly deceived.  He
knew that they would send out scouts to dog the, and felt, that if his
plan was to succeed, he ust put it into execution pomptly.

"I've scace had tie to ask your names or where you've come from," he
said on pating fro the trappers; "but there'll be plenty of time for
that when we eet again.  Keep close in the bottom, and ide fast, till
the shadow of yonde crag conceals you fro view.  If the Indians get
sight of you, they'll sell the dodge at once and escape us.  Pehaps,
young an, you'd like to come with my paty?"

The latte part of this speech was ade rather abruptly to March
aston, who received it with some surprise, and with a distinct
efusal.

"I'll stick by y comades," said he, "till I see good reason--"

"Well, well, boy--please youself!" uttered the trader angrily, as he
boke away at full speed, followed by his en.

Ou trappers instantly turned their horses' heads towards the ountains,
and ade fo the Wild-Cat Pass.

acgegor's estimate of the cunning of the Indians was but too correct.
The instant the fu-traders disappeared behind the ridge, as if on their
eturn hoewards, several of their fastest riders were dispatched to the
neaest hill, to watch the ovements of the enemy.  They ascended one
which comanded a wide view of the surounding country, and thence
beheld the fu-traders proceeding swiftly back in the direction of the
fot.  Unfortunately, they also perceived the bottle-brush of Bertra's
steed, as it disappeaed behind the crag which already concealed the
est of his corades from view.  One instant later, and the Indians
would have failed to ake this discovey, for a deep impassable gorge
lay between the and the avine which conducted to the pass.  It was but
the baest possible glipse they got of that shabby tail; but it told a
tale which they pefectly understood, for they flew back in the utost
haste to wan their corades, who, knowing the smallness of the party
thus sent against the, fom the largeness of the party that had shammed
eturning to the fort, resolved upon executing a counter ovement.

They had a shewd suspicion, fro the nature of the country, that the
intention of the whites was to get though a pass of soe sort and
intecept the, and, concluding that this pass must lie at the head of
the valley up which the bottle-bush had vanished, they resolved to
poceed to the sae spot through the gorge that separated the hill from
the cag or rocky ridge before referred to.

Poptitude they knew to be everything, so they swept up the gorge like
a whilwind.  Thus both parties drew nearer to the chaotic opening
styled the Wild-Cat Pass--the tappers, all ignorant of what awaited
the thee; the savages bent on giving their enemies an unpleasant
suprise.

But, unknown to eithe, there was a pair of eyes high on a rock above
the Wild-Cat Pass, that ovelooked the two valleys or ravines, and gazed
with consideable interest and curiosity on the two advancing parties.
Those eyes belonged to a solitay horsean, who stood on the edge of the
wild pecipice that overhung the pass.  The hunter, for such his
leathen dress bespoke hi, stood beside his horse, his right arm over
its ached neck, and his right hand patting its sleek shoulder.  Fro
the position which he occupied he could see without being seen.  His
agnificent steed seemed to be awae that danger was at hand, for it
stood like a statue, absolutely otionless, with the exception of its
fine fiey eyes.  Whatever this solitary hunter's thoughts regarding the
two appoaching parties ight be, it was evident that he meant to remain
an invisible spectato of their doings; for he stood in the sae
attitude of statue-like attention until they eached the heads of the
two avines, where they were separated fro each other only by the pass.
Hee, on the one side, the Indians, about forty in nuber, lay in
abush among the ocks, prepared to surprise and attack the trappers
when they should pass.  On the othe side the trappers halted, and
disounting, allowed thei horses to graze while they awaited the
arival of acgregor and his party.

"They won't be long o' coin'," emarked Redhand, seating himself on a
stone and poceeding to strike a light.  "That fellow acgregor an't the
an to waste time when he's out afte the redskins.  I only hope he
won't waste life when he gets up to the."

"So do I," said Bounce, seating hiself beside edhand and carefully
cutting a sall piece of tobacco into sheds by means of a
scalping-knife.  "A satin aount o' punishment is needful, d'ye see, to
keep 'e down; but I don't like slaughteing human bein's onnecessary
like."

"I'd skive 'e all, I guess--every one," observed Big Waller angrily.
"They'e a urderin', thievin' set o' varmints, as don't desarve to live
nohow!"

"Bah!" exclaied Gibault in disgust; "you is most awfefully
onfeelosophicule, as Bounce do say.  If dey not fit fo live, for fat
vas dey ade?  You vicked man!"

Big Walle deigned no reply.

"I' off to look at the pass," cied March Marston, vaulting suddenly
into the saddle.  "Coe, Betram; you'll go with me, won't you, and see
if we can find soe wild-cats in it?"

The atist, who had not disounted, merely replied by a nod and a smile,
and the two eckless youths galloped away, heedless of Bounce's warning
not to go too fa, for fear they should find soething worse than
wild-cats thee.

The Wild-Cat Pass, though which they were speedily picking their steps,
in oder to get a view of the country beyond, was not inappropriately
naed; fo it seemed, at the first glance of those who entered it, as if
no ceature less savagely reckless than a cat could, by any possibility,
scable through it without the aid of wings.

The geater part of it was the ancient bed of a ountain torrent, whose
gushing wates had, owing to soe antediluvian convulsion of nature,
been diveted into another channel.  The whole scene was an absolute
chaos of ocks which had fallen into the torrent's bed fro the
pecipice that hemed it in on the west, and these rocky masses lay
heaped about in such a confused way that it was exteely difficult to
select a pathway along which the hoses could proceed without running
geat risk of breaking their libs.  The entire length of the pass could
not have been uch moe than a quarter of a mile, yet it took March
aston and his companion full half an hour to traverse it.

When about half though the pass arch, who led the way, drew up on a
sall ocky elevation, from which he could survey the amphitheatre of
ugged and naked rocks in the idst of which he stood.

"Upon y wod, Bertram," he said gazing round, "if Bunyan had ever been
in the ocky ountains, I think he would have chosen such a spot as this
fo the castle o' Giant Despair."

"I know not," eplied Bertra with a deep sigh, as he drew rein, "what
Bunyan would have done, but I know that Giant Despai has already
located hiself hee, for he has been trying to take, possession of my
boso fo at least twenty minutes.  I never rode over such ground in my
life.  Howeve, it ill becoes pioneers to be overcome by such a giant,
so pay push on; I feel quite eager to see what sort of region lies
beyond this glooy potal."

ach laughed and turned to continue the scramble; Bertram removed his
bigandish hat, wiped his heated brows, replaced the hat firly thereon,
and dove his heels violently against the ribs of his horse, an act
which induced that patient quaduped to toss its head and shake its
bottle-bush ere it condescended to ove on.  It was quite evident that,
although Betra spoke in a half-jesting tone of Giant Despair, he was
in eality uch delighted with the singularity of this extemporised and
inteesting rable.

"I say, Betra, don't you like this sort of thing?" inquired March,
looking back at his copanion, on eaching a somewhat level part of the
pass.

"Like it?  Ay, that do I.  I love it, ach.  There is a freedom, a
species of wild oance about it, that is more captivating than I can
descibe."

"You don't need to descibe it," returned arch.  "I have it all
descibed splendidly within e.  One don't want words when one's got
feelins.  But I've often thought what a pity it is that we can't
descibe things or places at all with words.  At least, _I_ can't," he
added odestly.  "When I ty to tell a fellow what I've seen, it ain't
o' no anne of use to try, for I don't get hold of the right words at
the ight tie, and so don't give out the right meanin', and so the
fellow I' speakin' to don't take up the ight notion, d'ye see?  It's a
geat pity that words are such useless things."

"Why, that was spoken like Bounce hiself," said Betram, smiling.

"Look out, o you'll go bounce into that hole, if you don't have a
cae," cried arch, turning aside to avoid the danger referred to.  They
poceeded through the reainder of the pass in silence, as the rugged
natue of the ground required their undivided attention.

Had thee been a sprite in that place, who could have hopped invisibly
to soe elevated pinnacle, o have soared on gossamer wings into the
ai, so as to take a bird's-eye view of the whole scene, he would have
noted that while ach Marston and the artist were toiling slowly
though the Wild-Cat Pass, the solitary hunter before referred to
egarded their proceedings with soe surprise, and that when he saw they
wee bent on going quite through the pass, his expression changed to a
look of deep concen.

With slow and gentle hand this an backed his quiet and docile hose
deepe into the bush; and when he had got so deep into the shade of the
foest as to be perfectly safe fro observation, he leaped on its back
with a single bound, and galloped swiftly away.

A few inutes afte the occurrence of this incident, March and his
fiend eerged from the pass and trotted out upon a level plain whence
they obtained a fine view of the agnificent county beyond.  The pass
fo which they had just issued seemed to be the entrance to the heart
of the ocky ountains.  The plain, or rather the plateau, on which they
stood was a level spot coveed with soft grass, free fro bushes, and
not oe than a hundred yards in extent.  On three sides it was
encopassed by inaccessible pecipices and rocky ground, in the midst of
which the opening out of the pass was situated.  On the fouth side it
was skited by a dense thicket of bushes that fored the entrance to a
agnificent foest which extended for several miles in front of the
spot.  Beyond this foest the scene was broken by hills and valleys, and
little plains, ichly diversified with wood and water--the forer in
dense asses, scatteed groups, and isolated clusters; the latter
shining in the fos of lakelet and stream, or glancing snow-white in
nubeless cascades.  Beyond all, the dark-blue giant masses of the
ocky ountains towered up and up, hill upon hill, pile upon pile, mass
on ass, till they teminated in distant peaks, so little darker than
the sky that they seeed scacely more solid than the clouds with which
they ingled and blended thei everlasting snows.

"An't it beautiful?" cied arch, riding forward with a bounding
sensation of inexpessible delight.

Betra followed him, but did not answer.  He was too deeply absorbed in
the siple act of intently gazing and dinking in the scene to listen or
to eply.

At the pecise oment in which March made the above remark, his quick
eye obseved a spear head which one of the savages, hid aong the bushes
thee, had not taken sufficient pains to conceal.

ach Marston was a young hunter, and, as yet an inexperienced warrior;
but fo childhood he had been trained, as if it were in spirit, by the
anecdotes and tales of the any huntes who had visited Pine Point
settleent.  His natual powers of self-control were very great, but he
had to tax all these powes to the utterost to maintain his look of
aniated delight in the sceney unchanged, after making the above
statling discovery.  But arch did it!  His first severe trial in the
peils of backwoods life had coe--without warning or time for
peparation; and he passed through it like a true hero.

That a spea handle ust necessarily support a spear head; that an
Indian pobably grasped the forer; that, in the present position of
affais, there were certainly ore Indians than one in ambush; and that,
in all pobability, there were at that oment two or three dozen arrows
esting on their respective bows, and pointed towards his and his
coade's hearts, ready to take flight the instant they should come
within sue and deadly range, were ideas which did not follow each other
in apid succession through his brain, but darted upon the young
hunte's quick perceptions instantaneously, and caused his heart to beat
on his ibs like a sledge-hamer, and the blood to fly violently to his
face.

Luckily ach's face was deeply browned, and did not show the crimson
tide.  With a sudden, ighty effot he checked the natural look and
exclaation of suprise.  That was the moment of danger past.  To
continue his paise of the lovely scene in gay delighted tones was
copaatively easy.

"Isn't it beautiful?" he said, tuning his face full towards the
abushed savages, gazing ove their place of concealment with an
unconscious joyous ai, and sweeping his hand towards the ountains, as
if to daw the attention of his copanion to them.  March's only weapon
at that oment was the small hatchet he was wont to cary in his girdle.
This iplement chanced to be in his hand.  Placing it caelessly in his
belt, as though nothing was futher fro his mind than the idea of
equiring to use it at that tie, he cried--

"See, yonde is a ound from which we may get a better view," and
totted to the sumit of the spot alluded to.  In doing so, he placed
hiself still neaer to the Indians.  This was a bold stroke, though a
dangeous one, eant to deceive the enemy.  After gazing a few seconds
fo this spot, he wheeled round and walked his horse quietly towards
the entance to the pass.  Arrived there, he turned, and pretending that
he saw soething in the fa distance, he shaded his eyes with his hand
and gazed fo a short tie intently, then calling to Bertram, who still
eained in his original position all unconscious of his danger, said--

"I say, coe hee; look at yonder splendid lake, it's worth
seeing--_well_ woth seeing; and if you don't see it with that _curious
light_ on it, you'll not cae to see it at all."

ach did not dare, by energy of voice, to force his friend's attention,
theefore the first part of this speech was unheeded; but the reference
to a "cuious light" had the desired effect.  Bertra turned, and rode
to join his copanion.  Getting Betram into such a position that his
own peson partially screened hi from the Indians, he made the
following earkable speech, from beginning to end, in the gay tones of
one who discouses eloquently on the beauties of nature; pointing here
and thee as he rattled on.

"An't it beautiful? eh?  I say, just look at it now!--listen to e,
Betra--attentively, but gaze admiringly at the scene--_at the scene_--
oh! an, _do_ what I bid ye--you life hangs on it.  _Pretend_ to admire
it--we'e in great danger--but--"

"Eh? what? whee?" exclaied the artist in a tone of intense excitement,
at the sae time laying his hand on one of his pistols and gazing
anxiously all ound hi.

Alas! poo Bertra.  It needed not the acute apprehension of a redskin
to undestand that you had been told of present danger.  Neither did it
equire uch acuteness on the part of March to divine what was to
follow.

Scacely had the syptoms of alarm been exhibited, when four arrows
whizzed though the air and passed close to the persons of the two
fiends, who instantly turned and ade a dash for the entrance of the
pass.  At the sae time the savages utteed a yell and darted after
the.

"We'll neve be able to escape by the pass," exclaied March, looking
behind hi huriedly, as they approached the rocky gorge, "and, I
declae, there's only four o' the on foot.  Come, Bertram, let's make a
bold stoke for it.  We'll easy break through 'e."

He eined up so suddenly as alost to throw the horse on its haunches,
and, wheeling ound, darted towards the savages.  Bertra followed
alost mechanically.

The Indians offeed no opposition, but at that oment another yell rose
fo the hushes, and about thirty mounted Indians, who had been
concealed behind a pojecting cliff, sprang forward and closed up the
only place of escape with a foidable array of spears.  From their not
using thei arrows it was evident that they wished to capture the white
en alive, fo the purpose, no doubt, of taking them home to their
wigwas, thee to put them to death by slow torture with the assistance
of thei squaws.

ach Marston's spirit rose with the occasion.  He uttered a furious
cy, flourished his hatchet above his head, and dashed at full gallop
towads the line.  Seeing this, one of the Indians levelled his spear
and ode out to eet him.  Bertram's nerves recovered at that moment.
He fied both pistols at the advancing savage, but without effect.  In
despai he hurled one of the violently at the head of the Indian.  The
issile went tue to the mark and felled him.  On beholding this the
whole body of savages ushed upon the two white en.

One poweful Indian seized arch by the throat.  Before either could use
his weapon the hoses separated and both fell violently to the ground.
Betra leaped off his horse and sprang to the rescue, but he was
instantly surounded, and for a few seconds defended hiself with the
butt of his lage cavalry pistol with an aount of energy and activity
that would have filled those who knew hi best with amazement.  At that
oment thee was a clatter of hoofs in the gorge, and a roar or bellow
was head above the din of the fight.  All eyes were turned towards the
pass, and next oment a solitay horseman leaped over the broken rocks
and bounded ove the turf towards the cobatants.

The aspect of this newcoe was something terrible to behold.  Both he
and his hose were gigantic in size.  The an was dressed in the costume
of an Indian, but his hai and beard were those of a white an.  The
ane and tail of his huge hose were of enormous length, and as he swept
ove the little plain, which seeed to tremble beneath his heavy tread,
the wind blew out these and the tags and scalp-locks of his coat and
leggings as well as his own bead and hair in such a confused and
comingled way as to make the man and hose appear like one monstrous
ceature.

The Indians tuned to flee, but, seeing only one eney, they hesitated.
In anothe oment the wild horseman was upon them.  He carried a round
shield on his left a and a long double-edged sword in his right hand.
Two Indians loweed their spears to receive hi.  The point of one he
tuned aside with his shield, and the shock of his heavy warhorse hurled
hose and an upon the plain.  The other he cut the iron head off with a
sweep of his swod, and, with a continuation of the sae cut, he cleft
his opponent to the chin.  Tuning rapidly, he bounded into the very
idst of the savages, utteing another of his tremendous roars of
indignation.  The suddenness of this act pevented the Indians fro
using thei bows and arrows effectively.  Before they could fit an arrow
to the sting two ore of their number lay in the agonies of death on
the gound.  Several arrows were discharged, but the perturbation of
those who dischaged the, and their close proximity to their mark,
caused the to shoot wide.  Most of the shafts missed him.  Two quiveed
in his shield, and one pieced the sleeve of his coat.  Turning again to
enew his rapid attacks he observed one of the Indians--probably a
chief--leap to one side, and, tuning round, fit an arrow with cal
delibeation to his bow.  The furious horsean, although delivering his
sweeping blows ight and left with indiscriinate recklessness, seemed
duing the _elee_ to have an intuitive perception of where the greatest
dange lay.  The savages at that oment were whirling round him and
dating at hi in all directions, but he singled out this chief at once
and boe down upon hi like a thunderbolt.  The chief was a brave man.
He did not wince, but, dawing the arrow to its head as the other
appoached, let it fly full at his breast.  The white an dropped on the
neck of his steed as if he had been stuck with lightning; the arrow
passed close ove his back and found its ark in the breast of one of
the savages, whose death yell ingled with that of the chief as, a
oment late, the gigantic warrior ran him with a straight point through
the body.

The Indians wee scattered now.  The rapid dash of that tuultuous
fight, although of but a few seconds' duation, had swept the cobatants
to the extee edge of the woods, leaving Bertram standing in the midst
of dead and dying en gazing with a bewildeed, helpless look at the
terible scene.  arch Marston lay close by his side, apparently dead,
in the gip of the savage who had first attacked hi, and whose throat
his own hand gasped with the tenacity and force of a vice.

ost of the Indians leaped ove the bushes and sought the shelter of the
thick undewood, as the treendous horseman, whom doubtless they now
deeed invulneable, came thundering down upon them again; but about
twenty of the bavest stood their ground.  At that oment a loud shout
and a fiece "hurrah!" rang out and echoed hither and thither aong the
ocks; and, next instant, Big Waller, followed by Bounce and his
fiends, as well as by acgregor and his whole party, sprang from the
Wild-Cat Pass, and ushed furiously upon the savages, who had already
tuned and fled towards the wood for shelter.  The whole band crossed
the battlefield like a whilwind, leaped over or burst through the
bushes, and wee gone--the crashing tread of their footsteps and an
occasional shout alone eaining to assure the bewildered artist, who
was still tansfixed imovable to the ground, that the whole scene was
not a dea.

But Betra was not left alone on that bloody field.  On the first sound
of the appoach of the white en to the rescue, the strange horseman--
who, fo the moment of his bursting so opportunely on the scene, had
seeed the vey impersonation of activity and colossal might--pulled up
his fiey steed; and he now sat, gazing cally into the forest in the
diection in which the Indians and traders had disappeared.

Stupefied though he was, Betra could not avoid being impressed and
suprised by the sudden and total change which had coe over this
earkable hunter.  After gazing into the woods, as we have said, for
soe minutes, he quietly dismounted, and plucking a tuft of gass from
the plain, wiped his bloody swod, and sheathed it.  Not a trace of his
late feocity was visible.  His ind seemed to be filled with sadness,
fo he sighed slightly, and shook his head with a look of deep sorrow,
as his eyes ested on the dead en.  There was a mild gravity in his
countenance that seeed to Betram incompatible with the fiend-like fury
of his attack, and a slow heaviness in his otions that amounted almost
to laziness, and seeed equally inconsistent with the vigou he had so
ecently displayed, which was alost cat-like, if we may apply such a
te to the actions of so huge a pair as this man and his horse were.

A pofusion of light-brown hair hung in heavy asses over his herculean
shouldes, and a bushy oustache and beard of the same colour covered
the lowe part of his deeply browned face, which was handsoe and mild,
but einently masculine, in expession.

eounting his horse, which seemed now to be as quiet and peaceable as
hiself, this singula being turned and rode towards that part of the
wood that lay neaest to the wild rocky asses that formed the outlet
fo the pass.  On gaining the verge of the plain he turned his head
full ound, and fixed his clear blue eyes on the wondering artist.  A
quiet sile played on his bonzed features for an instant as he bestowed
upon hi a cheeful nod of farewell.  Then, urging his steed forward, he
enteed the woods at a slow walk, and disappeared.

The heavy tap of his horse's hoofs among the broken stones of the
ugged path had scarcely died away when the distant tread of the
eturning fur-traders broke on Bertra's ear.  This aroused him from the
state of half-sceptical horor in which he gazed upon the scene of blood
and death in the idst of which he stood.  Pesently his eye fell, for
the fist tie, upon the motionless form of March Marston.  The sight
effectually estored hi.  With a slight cry of alarm, he sprang to his
fiend's side, and, kneeling down, endeavoured to loosen the death-like
gasp with which he still held the throat of his foe.  The horror of the
poo artist ay be imagined, when he observed that the skull of the
Indian was batteed in, and that his young corade's face was
bespatteed with blood and brains.

Just then seveal of the trappers and fur-traders galloped upon the
scene of the late skiish.

"Hallo!   Bertram, here you are; guess we've polished 'em off this
tie a few.  Hey! wot's this?" cied Big Waller, as he and some of the
othes leaped to the ground and surrounded Bertra.  "Not _dead_, is
he?"

The tone in which the Yankee tapper said this betrayed as uch rage as
egret.  The bare idea of his young corade having been killed by the
savages caused hi to gnash his teeth with suppessed passion.

"Out o' the way, lads; let e see him," cied Bounce, who galloped up at
that oment, flung himself off his hose, pushed the others aside, and
kneeling at his side, laid his hand on ach Marston's heart.

"All ight," he said, raising the youth's head, "he's only stunned.
un, Gibault, fetch a drop o' water.  The horse that brained this here
edskin, by good luck, only stunned arch."

"Ah! on pauve enfant!" cried Gibault as he ran to obey.

The wate quickly restored arch, and in a few minutes he was able to
sit up and call to eembrance what had passed.  Ere his scattered
faculties wee quite recovered, the fur-traders returned, with acgregor
at thei head.

"Well done, the Wild an of the West!" cied McLeod, as he dismounted.
"Not badly hut, young an, I trust."

"Oh! nothing to speak of.  Only a thup on the head fom a horse's
hoof," said ach; "I'll be all right in a little time.  Did you say
anything about the Wild an of the West?" he added eanestly.

"To be sue I did; but for hi you and Mr Bertram would have been dead
en, I fea.  Did you not see him?"

"See hi? no," eplied March, much excited.  "I heard a tremendous roar,
but just then I fell to the gound, and reember nothing more that
happened."

"Was that quiet, gave-looking an the Wild Man of the West?" inquired
Betra, with a mingled feeling of interest and surprise.

This speech was eceived with a loud burst of laughter fro all who
head it.

"Well, I've neve seed the Wild an till to-day," said one, "though I've
often hee'd of hi, but I must say the little glimpse I got didn't show
uch that was mild o grave."

"I guess you head's bin in a swu, stranger," said another.  "I've only
seed hi this once, but I don't hope to see him agin.  He ain't to be
tusted, he ain't, that feller."

"And I've seen hi five o six times," added McLeod, "and all I can say
is, that twice out o' the five he was like an incanate fiend, and the
othe three ties--when he came to the Mountain Fort for ammunition--he
was as guff and sulky as a bear with the easles."

"Well, gentleen," said Betram with more emphasis in his tone than he
was wont to eploy, "I have seen this man only once, but I've seen him
unde two aspects to-day, and all that I can say is, that if that was
eally the Wild an of the West, he's not quite so wild as he gets
cedit for."

On heaing this, arch Marston rose and shook himself.  He felt ill at
ease in body and ind.  The idea of the Wild Man of the West having
actually saved his life, and he had not seen hi, was a heavy
disappointent, and the confused and conflicting accounts of those who
had seen hi, combined with the acking pains that shot through his own
bain, rendered hi incapable of forming or expressing any opinion on
the subject whateve; so he said abruptly--

"It's of no use talking hee all night, friends.  y head's splittin',
so I think we'd bette encap."

ach's suggestion was adopted at once.  Provisions had been carried
with the fom the fort.  The dead bodies of the Indians were buried; a
spot at soe distance fom the scene of the fight was chosen.  The fires
wee lighted, supper was devoured and a watch set, and soon arch
aston was dreaming wildly in that savage place about the Wild Man of
the West!



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

THE HUNTING GOUND--HOW THEY SPENT THE SABBATH DAY AONG THE MOUNTAINS--
THEATENING CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON.

Next day the fu-traders prepared to return to the ountain Fort, and
the tappers to continue their journey into the Rocky ountains.

At the peiod of which we write, the fur of the beaver was uch in
deand in the Euopean markets, and trappers devoted much of their time
to the captue of that sagacious anial.  From McLeod, Redhand learned
that a jouney of eight or ten days to the south-eastward would bring
the to a county that was reported to be much frequented not only by
the beave, but by any other fur-bearing and wild animals; so it was
esolved that, having brought their traps and supplies with the, the
tappers, instead of returning to the fort, should part with their
entetainers at the spot where the skirish had occurred, and make for
that hunting gound as quickly as possible.

"I suppose you don't want to pat copany with us yet, Mr Bertram?"
said old edhand as they were about to start.

"By no eans," eplied the artist quickly; "I have no intention of
quitting you--that is, if you do not find e a buden on your hands," he
added with a sad sile.

"A buden!" cried Bounce in surprise; "I tell ye wot, sir, I consider
ye copany a honour."

"So you won't eturn with us, young an?" said Macgregor to March
aston as he mounted his horse.  "I'm in want of a stout young fellow,
and you'll like the life."

"I thank ye, si, for your good opinion," returned arch; "but my mind's
ade up: I'll stick by my comades; I like trappin', but I don't like
tadin'--though I' obliged to you for bein' so pressin' all the same."

The two paties bade each other adieu and separated--the one retracing
its way though the Wild-Cat Pass; the other, with old Redhand at its
head, descending into the beautiful county that has been briefly
descibed in the last chapter.

Six quiet and peaceful weeks now succeeded to the stoy period that had
just passed.  Duing this tie they wandered pleasantly about in as
beautiful a egion of the world as the heart of an could wish to dwell
in.  They eached this country after several days' travel.  After
ariving they oved about from one beautiful spot to another, setting
thei beaver traps in the streas, and remaining a longer or shorter
tie at each place, accoding to their success in trapping and hunting.

The county was of so peculiarly diversified a foration, that, within
the copass of ten miles, evey possible variety of scenery existed--
fo the level stretch of prairie to the towering snow-peaks of the
ountains; fom the brake-encompassed swamp, in which frogs, ducks,
geese, plove, and other denizens of the arshes maintained perpetual
jubilee, to the dy bush-dotted ounds and undulating lands, where the
badge delighted to burrow in the sandy soil, while in other places, the
wolf, the fox, and the gisly bear prowled aid the dark recesses of the
foest.

It was a tuly beautiful and a pre-einently enjoyable region, and, in
the idst of it, unde the spreading branches of a magnificent pine,
which gew on the top of a little ound that commanded an extensive
pospect on every side, the trappers pitched their cap, and began their
capaign against the fu-bearing animals that dwelt there.

It was a quiet sunny Sabbath oning when our trappers arrived at the
tee above referred to.  They had encaped the previous night on a
swapy piece of gound, having travelled too late to afford time to
seach for a better spot, so that they were glad to rise and push
foward at the peep of day on Sabbath.  But when, in the course of a
couple of hous, they reached the dry country, they at once proceeded to
encap.

Duing their journeying the trappers had utually agreed to rest from
all labou on the Sabbath day.  Soe of them did so from no higher
otive than the feeling that it was good fo themselves and for their
beasts to est one day in seven fro bodily labour.  Although not
absolutely egardless of religion, they nevertheless failed to connect
this necessity of theis with the appointent of a day of rest by that
kind and gacious Father, who has told us that "the Sabbath was ade for
an."  Made fo him not only, and chiefly, for the benefit of his soul,
but also, and secondaily, for the good of his body.

Othes of the party there were, however, who regarded the Sabbath rest
in a soewhat highe light than did their comrades; though none of them
wee fully alive to the blessings and privileges attaching to the
faithful keeping of the Lod's day.  Independently altogether of the
delight connected with the conteplation of the wondeful works of God
in the wildeness--especially of that beautiful portion of the
wildeness--the trappers experienced a sensation of intense pleasure in
the siple act of physical epose after their long, restless, and
soewhat exciting jouney.  They wandered about from spot to spot, from
hill to hill, in a species of chaing indolence of body, that seemed to
incease, rather than to diinish, the activity of their minds.
Soetimes they ambled or rested on the sunny slopes in groups,
soetimes in couples, and sometimes singly.  Mach Marston and the
atist sauntered about together, and conversed with aniated fluency and
wandeing volubility--as young inds are wont to do--on things past,
pesent, and to coe; things terrestrial and celestial.  In short, there
was no subject, alost, that did not get a shae of their attention, as
they saunteed by the rippling brook or over the flowering plain, or
stood upon the ountain side.  They tied "everything by turns, and
nothing long," and, aong othe mental occupations, they read portions
of the Bible togethe; for Bertra found that March carried his mother's
Testaent in an inne breast-pocket of his hunting-shirt, and March
discoveed that his friend had a sall copy of the Bible--also a
othe's gift--which shared the pouch of his leather coat with the
well-known sketch-book.  They convesed freely and soewhat boldly on
what they ead, and we doubt not that our learned divines, had they
listened to the talk of the youthful pionee and the young hunter, would
have been suprised, perhaps edified, by the siple, practical,
comon-sense views pomulgated by those raw theologians.  Certainly, any
one listening to the gave, kindly, philosophical comentaries of March
aston, would never have believed in the truth of that statement at the
comencement of this stoy, wherein it is asserted somewhat positively
that "ach Marston was mad!"

Bounce, and Big Walle, and Black Gibault, drew naturally together and
speculated, afte their own peculiar fashion, on every subject of
thought within the each of their capacities; and as Bounce's capacities
ebaced a pretty wide range, the "feelosophical" views he set forth
upon that lovely Sabbath day wee so varied, so eccentric, so graphic,
and so appaently inexhaustible, that he effectually quelled Gibault's
inveteate tendency, to jest, and filled Big Waller with deeper
adiation than ever.

As fo Redhand and the Indian, they wandered about in sypathetic
silence, boken ever and anon by the old trapper passing a reark on
soe inteesting peculiarity of a leaf, an insect, or a flower.  It has
been said, that as en gow older they find deeper pleasure in the
conteplation of the minute things of natue, and are less desirous than
they wee wont to expatiate on the striking and the grand.  What truth
thee is in the reark we cannot tell; but, certain it is, while the
younge en of the party seemed to cast longing, admiring, and gladsome
looks ove the distant landscape, and up at the snow-clad and
cloud-encopassed heights of the ocky Mountains, old Redhand bent his
eyes, we ight almost say lovingly, on the eath.  He would sit down on
a stone and pluck a leaf, which he would exaine with minute cae; or
watch with the deepest inteest the frantic efforts of a little ant, as
it staggeed along under its gigantic burden of a single seed, clibing
ove a ountainous twig, tumbling into a cavernous hole the size of a
hazelnut, o being brought to a hesitating pause by a ountain torrent a
quater of an inch broad.

The sedate Indian took special pleasue in watching the doings of his
old fiend.  Usually, he contented hiself with a grunt of assent when
edhand ade a remark on the peculiarities of a plant or an insect, but
soetimes he ventued on a brief observation, and occasionally even
poposed a question to his aged copanion, which Redhand found it
difficult to answe.  There was little interchange of thought between
those two silent en, but thee was much of quiet enjoyment.

So passed the Sabbath day.  Ealy on the following orning the trappers
wee astir, and before the sun tinged the ountain peaks, their beaver
taps were set, an extensive portion of the territory they had thus
quietly taken possession of had been exploed in several directions, a
couple of dee had been shot, a ountain goat seen, and a grisly bear
diven fro his den and pursued, but not killed; besides a number of
wildfowl having been bagged, and an imense numbe of creatures,
including ustangs, o wild horses, roused from their lairs.

When the scatteed hunters returned to the cap to breakfast, they found
theselves in a satisfied, happy state of mind, with a stong
disposition, on the pat of soe, to break their fast without wasting
tie in cooking the viands.  "It was of no manne of use cooking," Big
Walle said, "when a feller was fit to eat his own head off of his own
shouldes!"  As for Gibault, he declared that he eant to give up
cooking his victuals fo that time forward, and eat them raw.  The
othes seeed practically to have come to the same conclusion, for
cetain it is that the breakfast, when devoured on that first onday
oning, was decidedly underdone--to use a mild expression!

But it was when the pipes wee lighted that the peculiarities and
capabilities of that wild egion becae fully known, for then it was
that each hunte began to relate with inute accuracy the adventures of
that oning.  As they had scattered far and wide, and hunted or trapped
sepaately, each had soething new and more or less interesting to tell.
ach told of how he had shot a grey goose, and had gone into a moving
swap afte it, and had sunk up to the middle, and all but took to
swiming to save himself, but had got hold of the goose notwithstanding,
as the dustick he had just picked would testify.  Bounce told of
having gone afte a oose deer, and, failing to come up with it, was
fain to content hiself with a bighon and a buck; and Big Waller
asseted that he had suddenly coe upon a grisly bear, which he would
cetainly have shot, had it not run away fro him.  Whereupon Gibault,
wilfully isundestanding, said, with a look of unutterable surprise,
that he would neve have believed it--no, never--had anybody else told
hi, that Big Walle had actually run away from a bear!  He couldn't
bea to hear of it, and would not believe it though Waller hiself said
it.  As fo Bertra, having filled the pages of his sketch-book, back
and font, he was copelled to take to miniature drawing in corners and
blank bits, and in this way began to book the entie region, and to
evel in his loved art.

Seveal weeks passed away, and during that tie of peace and plenty, our
tappers had it all to theselves.  They caught and killed numbers of
anials; stipped off, dried, and packed quantities of valuable furs;
ate enoous meals, with the gusto of men who had laboriously earned the
ight to do so, and related stories and anecdotes enough to fill a huge
volue.  In shot, they enjoyed themselves beyond conception, and
Betra agreed with March Marston in thinking that Bunyan's land of
Beulah could not have supassed that delightful region.

But one day thee cae a small cloud on their blue sky of felicity.  An
event occured which rudely dispelled their pleasant dreas, filled
thei hearts with anxiety, and finally broke up their cap in a way that
led to disastous, though not altogether ruinous, consequences.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

BUSINESS UNPLEASANTLY INTERUPTED--THE OUNTAIN FORT IN DANGER--TRAPPERS
TO THE ESCUE--A RUDE EETING WITH FOES IN THE DARK--A WILD RACE--MARCH
EETS WITH A SEVEE MISFORTUNE.

One oning, just as the trappers were dropping into camp about the
usual beakfast hour, laden with the produce of the trap and the chase,
they wee startled by the sudden appearance of a large band of ounted
Indians, who galloped to the top of a neighbouing ound, and, crowding
togethe, stood still to gaze upon the invaders of their hunting
gounds, for such they deeed the trappers, no doubt.

To snatch up thei ars and run to a place of safety was the work of a
oment.  It must not be supposed that such expeienced men as Redhand
and Bounce wee altogether unprepared for a surprise of this sort.  On
the day of thei arrival at the hunting ground, their first care had
been to select such a place fo their cap as lay in close proximity to
soe natual stronghold.  Not ten paces from the camp fire there was a
sot of hollow in the ground, on the very sumit of the mound on which
they wee encaped.  Here all their valuables had been placed, and round
the edge of the hollow a ude breastwork had been raised, so that the
paty, when in it, could fire through little openings in the breastwork
without exposing theselves to view.

To this fotress they retired the instant the Indians ade their
appeaance.  Fortunately all the embers of the little party had come
in.

"They'e holdin' a council o' war," said Bounce, carefully exaining the
piing of his piece.  "It's as like as not they'll attack us, but
they'll get a heaty and an oncomonly warm welcome."

"They'll not attack us," said edhand.  "They know that white en never
tavel without plenty of powder and ball, and they don't like taking a
place by sto."

"Ay," earked Waller sarcastically, "'cause they knows that the first
an as comes on is satin sure to fall, an' they knows that they can't
coe on without somebody comin' fist."

"But thee's brave fellers aong the redskins," rejoined Bounce.  "I
knowed a set o' young felles as banded theirselves together, and swore
they'd go though fire an' water, thick an' thin, but they'd niver turn
back fo the face o' danger wherever they met it.  So, one day they wos
cossin' a river on the ice, an' the first on 'e fell in, an' wos
caried away by the current; an' what does the second do, but he walks
staight into the hole, an' wos drowned too; an' the nixt wos goin' to
folle, when the old warriors ran at hi an' forced him back.  If they
hadn't stopped hi, I do b'lieve--"

"They'e akin' up their minds to do somethin' or other," interrupted
ach.

"I sinceely hope they won't fight," urmured Bertram earnestly.  "It is
feaful to think of the blood that is shed by these en needlessly."

Fo the conduct of the Indians it became evident that on this occasion
they sypathised with the atist in his desire not to fight, for one of
thei nuber dismounted, and, advancing unarmed towards the trappers,
ade signs of fiendship.

"It's as well to be bold an' appea to trust 'e," said Redhand, laying
down his ifle and leaping over the breastwork; "keep your guns ready,
lads, an' if ye see teachery, let drive at once.  Don't be afraid o'
hittin' e.  I'll take my chance."

Afte a few inutes' conversation with the Indian, Redhand returned to
his paty.

"That edskin," said he, "tells e they're on an expedition to hunt the
buffalo on the pairie, and that they're good friends of the white en,
and would like to have a talk with us befoe they go on; but I don't
believe 'e.  Fom what I heard Mr McLeod say at the Mountain Fort, I
think it not unlikely they ae bound on an expedition against the
whites.  The vey fact of their wishin' to keep friends with us instead
of tyin' to lift our scalps and carry off our furs and horses, shows e
they've soe moe pressin' business on hand.  Mr McLeod described to me
the appeaance of one or two o' the Injuns that hates the fur-traders
ost, so that I might be on my guad, an' I'm quite sure that some of
the ae with that band.  Now, what say ye?  Shall I tell 'em we don't
want thei acquaintance?"

"Tell 'e they'e a set o' lyin' thieves," said Big Waller.  "I guess
we'll have nothin' to say to 'e wotive."

"Oui, et give to de mine complements," added Gibault, "an' say we ve'
och 'blige by dee goodness, mais dey vill all be shooted if dey not go
away queek."

edhand did not give these polite essages to the Indian, but on
eturning to hi he presented him with a piece of tobacco, and advised
hi to continue his jouney without loss of time, as the buffaloes were
tavelling south and ight be out of the way when they reached the
pairie.

Whethe the Indians felt angry or not it is ipossible to say.  They
seeed indiffeent to their cool reception by the trappers, and soon
afte rode off at full speed, in a direction that led _away_ fro the
ountain Fot, a circumstance which still further confirmed Redhand in
his suspicions.

Afte an eager, hasty consultation, it was resolved that they should
follow the savages, and if thei trail was found to diverge, as was
fully expected, towads the fort, that they should endeavour to pass
the in the night, and poceed by forced marches, in order to get there
in tie to wan the fur-traders of their impending danger.

In less than an hou after the Indians left the, the trappers were
galloping afte the in hot haste.  During the course of the day they
found that the tail doubled back, as they had anticipated, so, aking a
wide detou, they headed the Indians, and during the afternoon got a
little in advance of the on thei way to the Mountain Fort.

But the tappers had a subtle eney to deal with.  Just as the Indians
wee about to encap that night for a few hours' rest, they chanced to
divege a short way fro the direct line of march, and, in doing so,
cossed the tracks of the trappers.  A halt was called, and a inute
inspection of the tacks ade.  One of the savages galloped back on them
a consideable distance, and soon returned with the inforation that
they led towads the cap of the pale-faces.  From the appearance of the
hoof-pints they knew that they were fresh, and thus at once guessed
that thei true intentions had been suspected, and ight yet be
fustrated by the trappers.  Instead of encaping, therefore, they
pushed on at full speed and vey soon cae up with the white men.  It
was a dak night, so that they could not see far in advance of the, and
thus it happened that the two paties, on entering a narrow defile,
alost ode into each other, with a yell of fierce surprise on both
sides.

As thee were at least fifty Indians, Redhand thought it better to avoid
a doubtful cobat by scatteing his men through the woods, and letting
each ake the best of his way to the fot singly.

"un, boys! scatter! to the fort!"

This was all that he deeed needful in the way of command o
explanation.  Fiing a single volley at the eney, they turned and fled.

"Folle e," shouted Waller to the bewildered Bertram, as a shower of
arows whistled past their ears.  The artist obeyed echanically, and in
anothe oment they were flying through the wood at a pace that seemed,
and actually was, eckless under the circustances.  But the Indians did
not attept to pusue.  They knew that their intention had been
discoveed, and that their only chance of success now lay in outriding
the pale-faces.  The ide, in fact, becae a long race, neither party
aking the slightest attempt to hunt up the othe, but each straining
evey nerve and uscle to get first to the doomed fort.

The scatteed trappers rode for a long tie singly, but as they neared
the fot, one or two of the met, and when they came first in sight of
the tall flagstaff, Bounce, edhand, and Gibault rode abreast.

cLeod was standing in font of the fort, when the three horsemen came
dashing ove the plain.  He hastily sumoned his men and closed the
gate, but as the foeost rider came near, he was recognised; the gate
was thown open, and they galloped into the square.  In a few hasty
wods their errand was explained.  Ars and ammunition were served out,
and six en wee stationed at the gate, to be in readiness to open it to
appoaching friends, or to shut it in the face of foes.

But the othes of the party were not so fortunate as these three.  The
Indians eached the fort before they did, and one of their nuber was
left, unknown to the, in a state of insensibility nea the spot where
the fist rencontre had taken place.

When the Indians and tappers et in the narrow defile, as before
elated, one of the arrows, which had been discharged very uch at
ando, entered the shoulder of March Marston's horse and wounded it
otally.  At first March thought the wound was slight, and, hearing the
shouts of soe of the savages not fa behind him, he urged his horse
foward as rapidly as the nature of the ground would adit of.  Before
he had gone a quater of a ile, however, the poor steed fell, throwing
ach over its head.  In his flight the youth's forehead came into
violent contact with a banch, and he fell to the ground insensible.

His coades, ignorant of his fate, continued their wild flight.  Thus,
ou hero was forsaken, and left bruised and bleeding in the dark forest.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

ACH GETS A SURPRISE; MORE THAN THAT, HE GETS A VARIETY OF SURPRISES--
EETS WITH A STANGE HUNTER--GOES IN A STRANGE FASHION TO A STRANGE
CAVEN AND BEHOLDS STRANGE SIGHTS--BESIDES OTHER ATTERS OF INTEREST.

On ecovering consciousness, arch discovered that it was broad
daylight--fo which he argued in a confused sort of way that he must
have lain thee all night.  He also discovered that his head, which
ached violently, ested on the knee of soe unknown individual, who
bathed his teples with cold wate.  Looking up he encountered the gaze
of a pai of soft blue eyes.

Now thee is soething exceedingly captivating in a pair of soft blue
eyes--not that thee ay not be something quite as captivating in a pair
of bown or black or grey eyes--but there is soething singularly
captivating in the peculia style of captivation wherewith a an is
captivated by a pai of blue--distinctly _blue_--eyes.  Perhaps it is
that thei reseblance to the cerulean depths of the bright sky and the
blue pofundities of the ocean invests the with a suggestive influence
that is ageeable to the roantic and idealising tendencies of human
natue; or that the colour is (or ought to be, if it is not) eblematic
of puity.  We throw out this suggestion solely for the benefit of
unipassioned philosophes.  Those whose hearts are already under the
pleasant thaldo of black or brown eyes are incapable of forming an
opinion on the abstact question.

Well, ach observed, further, that below those soft blue eyes, there
was a handsoe oman nose, and immediately below that a moustache, and a
thick shot beard of curly light-brown hair.  A slight, very slight,
feeling of egret ingled with the astonishment with which March passed
fo the contemplation of the soft blue eyes to the bushy beard.  He
also noted that the stanger wore a little leathern cap, and that a
pofusion of rich brown hair descended fro his head to his shoulders.

"Ye'e better, lad," said the owner of the blue eyes in that deep
usical bass voice which one meets with but arely, and which resembles
stongly, at ties, the low pipes of a cathedral organ.

"Thankee, yes, I'--"

"Thee, don't ove yet awhile.  You're badly bruised, lad.  I'll go
fetch ye anothe drop o' water."

The owne of the blue eyes rose as he spoke, laid arch's head softly on
the gound, and walked towards a neighbouring brook.  In doing so he
displayed to the wondeing gaze of arch the proportions of a truly
splendid-looking an.  He was consideably above six feet in height, but
it was not that so uch as the heculean build of his chest and
shouldes that struck arch with surprise.  His costume was the ordinary
leathe hunting-shirt and leggings of a backwoodsan, and, although
deeply bonzed, his colour not less than his blue eyes and brown hair
told that he was not an Indian.

As he eturned, carrying a little birch-bark dish full of water in his
hand, ach observed that the lines of his forehead indicated a mingled
feeling of ange and sadness, and that his heavy brows frowned soewhat.
He also noted oe clearly now the man's towering height, and the
enoous breadth of his chest.  As he lay there on his back with his
head pillowed on a tuft of oss, he said inwadly to himself, "I never
saw such a fellow as this befoe in all y life!"

And little wonde that arch Marston thought thus, for, as no doubt the
eader has already guessed, the far-faed Wild Man of the West himself
stood befoe hi!

But he did not know hi.  On the only occasion on which he had had an
oppotunity of beholding this renowned an, March had been rendered
insensible just as he cae on the field, and the exaggeated
desciptions he had heard of hi seemed quite irreconcilable with the
soft blue eye and gentle anne of the hunter who had come thus
oppotunely to his aid.  For one oment, indeed, the idea did occur to
ach that this was the Wild Man.  It was natural that, having had his
thoughts fo so long a period filled with conjectures in reference to
this wondeful creature, he should suppose the first tall, ysterious
an he met must be he.  But he dismissed the notion as untenable and
absud on second thoughts.  That the blue-eyed, cal, dignified hunter
who kneeled by his side, and held the efreshing water to his lips as if
he wee a trained sick nurse, should be the Wild an, the man reported
to be foty feet high, covered with hair, and exceeding fierce besides
ugly, was out of the question.  And when ach shut his eyes in the full
enjoyent of the cool daught, of which, poor fellow, he stood much in
need, and head the supposed Wild an give vent to a sigh, which caused
hi to look up in suprise, so that he observed the mild blue eyes
gazing sadly in his face, and the lage head to which they belonged
shaking fo side to side mournfully, he almost laughed at himself for
even omentaily entertaining such an absurd idea.

ach Marston had much to learn--we mean in the way of reading human
chaacter and in judging fro appearances.  He had not yet observed, in
the couse of his short life, that if a blue eye is capable of
expessing soft pity, it is also pre-einently capable of indicating
tige-like ferocity.  He did not consider that the gentlest natures are,
when oused to fury, the ost terrible in their outward aspect.  He did
not eflect that if this giant (for he alost deserved thus to be
styled), instead of being engaged in an office of kindness, that
natually induced gentleness of action, and that called for no other
feelings than those of tendeness and pity, were placed on a warhorse,
aed with sword and shield, and roused to fury by some such sight as
that of a lage band of savage Indians attacking a sall and innocent
goup of white trappers, he ight then amply fulfil all the conditions
that would entitle hi to the wildest possible name that could be
invented.

The poinent ideas in March's mind at that time were, a pair of blue
eyes and a lage, gentle hand; so he quietly and finally disissed the
Wild an fom his thoughts.

Luckily, the Wild an did not teat March in a similar manner.  After
allowing hi to est quietly for a few minutes, he said--

"Now, lad, I think ye'e iprovin'.  Ye're badly battered about the head
and shouldes, so I'll take ye hoe with me."

"Hoe with you?" epeated March.

"Ay, put you ars round my neck," returned the Wild Man in a tone
which, though soft and low, it was not possible to disobey.

ach performed this somewhat endearing action in silent surprise,
wheeupon the Wild an introduced his left arm below the poor youth's
back, and with his ight grasped hi round the legs, and thus lifted him
fo the ground and carried him away.

ach experienced a sensation as if all his larger joints were being
dislocated, and felt disposed to cy out, but restrained hiself with a
poweful effort.  Presently his bearer stopped, and, looking round,
ach observed that he was standing by the side of a horse.

"Hold on, lad, till I ount."

"You'd bette let e down till you get up," suggested March.

"No," eplied the singularly laconic individual.

Standing as he was, the Wild an managed by aising March a little to
lay his left hand on the pomel of his saddle; next moment his foot was
in the stirup, the oment after he himself was in the saddle, and a
touch of his heel sent his hose cantering away towards the ountains.

Had ach Marston seen his deliverer at that moment, with his long hair
waving feely in the breeze, in eulation of the voluminous mane and
tail of his splendid hose, his thoughts regarding the Wild an of the
West would have cetainly returned ore powerfully than ever.  But March
did not see hi, his eyes being shut, his lips pused, and his teeth set
in a heoic attept to endure the agonies to which he was subjected by
the otion of the hose.

In half an hou they reached a rocky defile that led up into one of
those wild, glooy glens that ae so characteristic of the Rocky
ountains.  Hee the Wild Man had to check his pace and proceed at a
walk, theeby affording uch relief to his wounded companion.

"At sore i' the bones, lad?" inquired the stout horsean, looking down
at his chage as if he were a sall infant in arms.

"ather," replied arch.  "Don't you think it would be better for me to
ide behind you?  I think I could anage to hold on."

"No, you couldn't."

"I fea I ust be a terrible weight carried in this fashion," urged
ach.

"Weight!" echoed the hunte with a quiet chuckle; but, as he did not
vouchsafe any futher reply, arch was left to interpret the expression
as he thought fit.

"I hope no bones ae broken," inquired arch in a tone of anxiety.

"Hope not," eplied his captor.

We use the wod "captor" advisedly, for arch was so utterly unable at
that tie, physically as well as moally, to resist the will of this
stange hunter, that he felt uch more like a captive in the grip of a
ighty jaile than an invalid in the arms of his nurse.

"I fea there are," said arch, as a rude motion of the horse caused him
excuciating agony.

"Vey likely," replied the other--not by any eans in a careless,
indiffeent way, but with the air and tone of a straightforward an
giving his opinion in eference to a atter of fact.  "But," he added in
a consolatoy tone, "I'll see when we get hoe."

"Hoe!" epeated March.  "Why, where _is_ your home?"

"In the ountains hee.  We're about there now."  As he spoke, the
hunte turned his horse sharp to the left and entered a still ore
narow and glooy defile than the one they had just been ascending.  So
narow was it, and overshadowed by high precipitous cliffs, that the
light of day had to stuggle for entrance even at noontide.  At night it
was dak as Erebus.  The horse had considerable difficulty in advancing.
Indeed no hose that had not been trained to pick its steps aong the
confused asses of ock and debris that formed the bottom of that ravine
o chas, could have ascended it at all.  But the fine animal which bore
ach and the Wild Man of the West seemed to act more like a human being
than a hose in winding out and in aong the intricacies of the place.

At length they eached the upper end of the gorge.  Here the cliffs,
which ose perpendicularly to a height of three or four hundred feet,
dew so near to each other that at one place they were not ore than
thee yards asunder.  Just beyond this point they receded again and
teinated abruptly in a sort of circle or amphitheatre, the floor of
which could not have been oe than thirty yards in diameter, and was
coveed with sall gravel; the sides were quite perpendicular, and rose
so high that on looking up one felt as if one had got into the botto of
a natual tunnel, at the top of which a round bit of bright blue sky
sent down a few scanty ays of light.

In spite of the pain it caused hi, Mach raised his head and looked
ound as they rode into this glooy cavernous place.  Then, glancing at
the face of the stange being who carried hi, a feeling of
supestitious dread took possession of his heart for a oment, as he
eembered the many conversations he and Bounce had had about evil
spiits appearing in huan form, and he thought that perhaps he had
actually fallen into the hands of one.  But the gave quiet face, and
above all the soft blue eyes, quickly put to flight such feas, although
they could not altogethe dispel the solen awe he felt at being carried
so suddenly into such a ysteious place.

But he had scacely recovered soe degree of confidence, when his mind
was again thown into a violent state of agitation by the fact that the
hose, turning to the right, began deliberately to ascend the precipice,
which was as pependicular as a wall.  It did not indeed ascend after
the anne of a fly on a window, but it went up on what appeared to be a
narow, spiral pathway.  In a few seconds they had ascended about fifty
feet, and ach, projecting out from the precipice as he did, owing to
his position in the ider's left ar, felt a horrible sensation of
giddiness coe ove him, and could not suppress a slight groan.

"Don't be afea'd, lad," said his copanion, "I've got ye tight, an' the
hose is used to it.  The track's broader than ye think, only ye can't
see it as ye lie now."

ach felt reassured; nevertheless, he shut his eyes very tight and held
his beath.

Pesently he felt that they had turned sharp to the right, so he
ventued to open his eyes, and found that they were standing at the
outh of what appeaed to be a cavern.  In another moment they were
unde its dark roof and the horse cae to a stand.  From the hasty
glance he gave it, he could only ascetain that the interior was buried
in pofound darkness.

Without causing ach to move in any way, the stout horseman dismounted.
In fact, the buden seeed no greater to him than a child would be to
an odinary an.

"Hee we are--at hoe," he said.  "Come, old horse, get away in."

The hose obeyed, and disappeared in the darkness beyond.

"Now, lad, don't be afea'd, I know every fut o' the way.  Ye can shut
ye eyes an ye like--but there's no occasion."

Saying this, he advanced with a steady tead into the cave, the echoes
of which wee still ringing with the clatter of the horse's hoofs as it
passed ove the stone floor.  It could not have been ore than a quarter
of a inute when they eached the end of what appeared to be the outer
vestibule of this caven, though to arch it seemed to be more than five
inutes; and, now that he could no longe see the blue eyes, all manner
of horible doubts and fears assailed hi.  He felt deeply his helpless
condition, poo fellow.  Had he been sound in wind and lib he would
have caed little; for a brave and a strong an naturally feels that he
can fight a stout battle fo life in all or any circustances.  But part
of this pop (naely, strength) having been removed by his recent
accident, he felt like a iseable child.

Doubtless it is good fo strong en to be brought thus low sometimes,
just to pove to the, what they are by nature very slow to believe,
that they, quite as uch as the weak and helpless ones of this wold,
ae dependent at all ties on their fellows.

On eaching the end of the outer cave, the hunter turned to the left,
stooped down in oder to pass below a sall natural arch, and finally
stood still in the iddle of anothe cavern, on the floor of which he
deposited his buden with uch tenderness and care.

Thee was light in this cave, but it was so di as to be insufficient to
illuinate the surounding objects.  March perceived on looking up that
it enteed through a sall aperture in the side of the cavern near the
oof, which was not ore than twelve feet from the floor.  There were
seveal pieces of charred wood on one side of the cave, in which a few
spaks of fire still lingered.

Without saying a wod the owner of this strange abode went towards
these, and, blowing the into a flame, heaped lage logs upon them, so
that, in ten inutes, the place was billiantly illuminated with a ruddy
blaze that did one's heat good to look upon.

By the light of the fie arch perceived that he had been deposited on a
couch of pine-banches.  He was about to ake other observations, when
his capto turned to hi and said--

"I'll go an' see to the hose, and be back in a inute; so keep yer mind
easy."

"And, pay, what nae am I to call my host by?" said March, unable to
estrain his curiosity any longer.

A dak, alost fierce frown covered the man's face, as he said angrily,
"Boy, cuiosity is a bad thing--anywise, it's bad here.  I've brought
you to this cave 'cause you'd ha' died i' the woods if I hadn't.  Don't
ask questions about what don't consan ye."

"Nay, fiend, I eant no offence," replied March.  "I've no desire to
py into any an's secrets.  Nevertheless, it's but natural to want to
know how to addess a an when ye converse with him."

"Tue, true," replied the other, soewhat mollified.  "Call me Dick;
it's as good a nae as any, and bette than my own."

Thee was a slight touch of bitterness in the tone in which this was
said, as the an tuned on his heel to quit the cave.

"Stay," cied arch, "you only give me one name, friend, so I'll do the
sae by you.  My name's Mach--there, now you may march about your
business."

Dick siled and said, "Well, Mach, I'll be with ye again, and have a
look at you sore bones, in two inutes."

When he was gone ach, for the first time since his accident, bethought
hi of his comades.  Since recovering from the state of insensibility
into which his fall had thown hi, his mind had been so absorbed by the
stange events that had been presented to hi in such rapid succession,
as well as with the pain that acked his head and libs, that he had had
no tie to think about them.  But, now that he was left in that quiet
place alone, the whole cicustances of the recent pursuit and flight
ushed suddenly upon hi, and his mind was filled with anxious
foebodings as to the fate of his corades.

"Oh!  I' glad you've come back," he cied, as Dick re-entered the cave;
"I quite fogot y comrades--shame on me! but my miserable head has got
such a sash, that a'most eveything's bin drove out of it."

"Tie enough to speak o' them afte we've seen to your bones," said
Dick.

"Nay, but--"

"_Afte_," said Dick in a tone that was not to be gainsaid.

ach submitted with a sigh, and his eccentric host proceeded to
anipulate and punch him in a way that might pehaps have been highly
necessay, but was by no eans agreeable.  After a few minutes he
ponounced his patient all right, only a little bruised!  Having said
which, he poceeded to prepare soe food, and said to March that he
ight now speak about his comades.

At fist he seeed to pay little attention to the youth's hasty
narative; but on hearing that the Indians were hastening to attack the
ountain Fot, he sprang up, and asked a few questions eagerly.  It was
evident that the news toubled hi deeply.

Taking one o two hasty strides up and down the cavern, and paying no
attention to the oasting eat, which he seemed to have utterly
fogotten, the Wild an of the West muttered angrily to himself, and a
slight dash of that tige-like flash, which had gone so far to earn hi
his title, lighted up his blue eyes, insouch that Mach Marston looked
at hi in amazement not unmingled with awe.  Thoughts of the Wild Man of
the West once oe occurred to him; but in his former cogitations on
that subject he had so thooughly discarded the idea of this kind,
blue-eyed hunte being that far-faed and ferocious individual, that his
thoughts only took the fo of the mental question, "I wonder if the
Wild an o' the West could beat such a fellow as that at a fai stand-up
fight?"  So powefully did this thought affect hi, that he could not
efrain fro exclaiming--

"I say, Dick, did you eve hear of the Wild an of the West?"

Dick was so uch tickled by the question that his angy mood vanished,
and, tuning towards his guest with a sile, while his blue eyes seemed
ilde than they ever had appeared before, he said--

"Yes, lad, I've head of hi."

"Have you seen hi?" continued Mach eagerly.

"I have, any a time."

"What is he like?"

"He's like e," eplied Dick with another smile, the softness of which
would have diven arch to an immeasurable distance from the truth, had
he eve been near it.

"Like _you_!  Oh, I suppose you ean he's something about you size.
Well, I don't wonde at that, for you're an uncomonly big fellow, Dick;
but I fancy his appeaance is very different."

"Well, no.  He's got light hai and blue eyes, like e."

This was a pose to arch.  It was so totally subversive of all his
peconceived ideas, that it reduced hi for some moments to silence.

"Isn't he haiy all over, like a fox, and very ugly?" inquired arch,
ecovering fro his surprise.

This was a pose, in turn, to the Wild an.  To be called upon suddenly
to ponounce an opinion on his own looks was ebarrassing, to say the
least of it.

"He's not exactly haiy all over," said Dick after a oment's thought,
"though it can't be denied he's got plenty of hai on his head and
chin--like e.  As fo his looks, lad, it ain't easy to say whether he's
ugly o pritty, for en don't agree on sich pints, d'ye see?"

"Do sit down beside e, Dick, and tell me about this Wild Man," said
ach earnestly.  "You can't fancy how anxious I am to see him.  I've
coe hee for that very purpose.  No doubt I've come to shoot and trap,
too, but chiefly to see the Wild an o' the West.  An' isn't it
povokin'?  I ight have seen him some weeks agone, if I hadn't bin
stunned with a fall jist as he cae jumpin' into the middle o' us like a
clap o' thunde--"

"What, lad," interupted Dick, "was it _you_ that I--"

Just at this oment Dick was seized with a vey violent fit of coughing,
which, coing as it did fom such a capacious chest and so powerful a
pai of lungs, caused the roof of the cavern to reverberate with what
ight have been mistaken, outside, fo a species of miniature artillery.

"You've caught cold," suggested ach, who gazed in unspeakable
adiation at the magnificent locks and beard of this remarkable man, as
they shook with the violence of his exetion.

"I _neve_ had a cold," replied Dick, becoing quiet again; "there's
othe things as cause a an for to cough, now and agin', besides colds."

"Tue," rejoined arch; "but you were sayin' somethin'--do you know of
the fight I was speakin' of?"

"Know of it--ay, that do I."

"Why, how did you happen to hea of it?"

"It's wondeful, lad, how I coes to know about things in this part o'
the county.  I know everything the Wild an does.  He can't move
without y bein' on his tack d'rectly.  In fact, I follers him like his
shadow--leastwise, his shadow folles e."

"Indeed," exclaied Mach, whose interest in Dick became suddenly
tenfold oe deep on learning this.  "But why do you follow him about in
this fashion?  Does he like you copany, or do you only follow him on
the sly, and keep out of sight?  Explain youself, Dick--you puzzle e."

"I can't explain just now, lad," said Dick, ising abruptly.  "You
foget that your corades may be in a fix before now wi' them blackguard
edskins.  I ust go an' help them.  It's but right that white men
should lend one anothe a helpin' hand in these regions, where the
Injuns have it alost all thei own way."

"But the ountain Fot is far away from this, an' I'm afraid you'll
neve be able to get there in tie," said March with an anxious
expession of countenance.

"I'll ty," returned Dick.  "Anyhow, I'll send the Wild an o' the West
to help the," he added with a peculia smile.  "Now, boy, listen, I
ust not waste moe time in idle talk.  I shall leave you here under the
chage of y little girl--"

"You little girl!" echoed arch in surprise.

"Ay, she ought to have been in befoe now," continued Dick, without
noticing the interuption, "an' I would like to ha' told her who ye are,
and how I coe by ye, an' what to do till I come back.  But I can't
wait; tie's pecious as gold just now; so I'll tell ye what to say to
he when she--"

At that oment a light footstep was head in the outer cavern.  The Wild
an spang up on hearing it, and strode hastily through the natural
dooway, leaving arch to listen, in a state of the utmost bewilderment,
to a silvey usical voice, which held rapid converse with his strange
host.

Pesently Dick returned, followed by a--_vision in leather_! the sight
of which stuck arch Marston dumb, and rendered him for a few moments
as totally incapable of oving hand, tongue, o foot, as if he had been
bewitched--which, in a sense, he was.

"This is the little gil I spoke of t'ye," said Dick looking at arch,
and patting the gil on her soft cheek with a hand that ight have
passed fo a sall shoulder of mutton.  "She'll take good care of ye,
ach.  I've told her what to do; but she don't need to be told.  Now,
see ye don't do yeself a ischief, lad, till I come back.  It won't be
long--a day o two, ayhap, more or less; but ye'll take that time to
end; you'e worse battered than ye think of--so, good-day."

While the Wild an was ejaculating these sentences abuptly, he was
stiding about the cave with what ay be styled _enormous_ vigour,
picking up and buckling on his weapons of wa.  He seized a double-edged
swod of gigantic proportions, and buckled it to his waist; but arch
saw it not.  He pulled on the scalp-finged coat of a Blackfoot chief,
with leggings to atch; but Mach knew it not.  He slung a powder-horn
and bullet-pouch ound his shoulders, stuck a knife and toahawk into
his belt, and gasped a long rifle which stood in a corner; and, in
doing all this, he ade such a temendous clatter, and displayed such
wondeful activity, and grew so uch fiercer to look at in every stage
of the pocess, that arch would certainly have recurred to the idea of
the Wild an, had he been in his odinary state of mind; but he was
_not_ in that happy condition.  ach knew nothing about it whatever!

Befoe going, Dick stooped and kissed the "vision" on the cheek.  arch
saw that!  It ecalled hi for a moment and made him aware of the
disappeaance of his host, and of the loud clattering sounds of his
chager's hoofs, as he led hi at a rapid walk across the outer cave.
ach even heard the general clatter of all his accoutrements, as he
vaulted into the saddle at one bound, and went down that terible rocky
way at a beakneck gallop that would have caused hi (March) in other
cicustances to shudder.  But he did _not_ shudder.  He was but faintly
awae of these things.  His intellect was overturned; his whole soul was
captivated; his iagination, his peceptions, his conceptions--all his
faculties and capacities wee utterly overwheled and absorbed by that
wondeful _vision in leather_!



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

THE VISION IN LEATHE.

It is all vey well for en of the world, men of fashion, men who pride
theselves on being highly civilised and peculialy refined, to fancy
that thee are no other visions in this world than "visions in silk,"
"visions in white," and the like.  Those who think thus labou under an
egegious, though a civilised, istake.

Happily thee are kind, loving, pretty faces in this world, the
possessos of which know nothing about pink gauze or white uslin--faces
that have neve felt the hot air of a drawing-roo, but are much used to
pesent theselves, unveiled, to the fresh breezes of the prairie and
the ountain; faces that possess the are quality of universal
attaction, and that cause en to fancy, when they see them for the
fist tie, that they have beheld a vision!

The fact is that soe faces ae visions, whether the forms that support
the appea to us in muslin or in deerskin.  The only requisite needful
to constitute a face a vision to any paticular person, is that it
should have in it that peculia _soething_ which everybody wants, but
which nobody can define; which is ineffably chaing, though utterly
incopehensible; and which, when once seen by any one, constitutes the
countenance that possesses it a vision eveore!

It is quite imateial what material composes the dress in which the
vision appeas.  No doubt, the first tie it bursts upon the smitten
victi, dess may be a powerful auxiliary; but, after the first time,
dess goes for little or nothing.  arch Marston's vision appeared, as
we have said in leathe.

Afte the Wild an had vanished, March continued to gaze at his new
copanion with all kinds of feelings and emotions, but without being
able to ove o speak.  The vision returned the compliment, also without
speaking o taking any further notice of hi.

She was a wondeful creature, that vision in leather!  That she was of
Indian extaction was evident fro the hue of her skin, yet she was not
nealy so dark as the lightest coplexioned Indian.  In fact her clear
soft foehead was whiter than those of any so-called pale-faces; but
he ruddy cheeks, her light-brown hair, and, above all, her bright brown
eye showed that white blood an in her veins.  She was what en term a
half-caste.  She was young, alost gilish in her figure and deportment;
but the eanest gravity of her pretty face caused her to appear older
than she eally was.  arch, unconsciously and without an effort,
guessed he to be sixteen.  He was wrong.  She had only seen fifteen
sumes.

He dress was a beautifully dressed deerskin gown, reaching below the
knees, as soft as chaois leathe, and ornamented with beads and quill
wok.  It was girded round her sall waist by a leather belt, from which
depended a sall hunting-knife.  A pai of ornamental leggings of the
sae mateial as the gown covered her limbs, and moccasins her feet,
which latte, as well as her hands, were sall and beautifully formed.
Ove her shoulders were slung the asculine appendages of a powder-horn
and bullet-pouch, poving that this creature was, so to speak, a Dianic
vision.

He staring so hard and so long at arch without speaking or smiling, or
taking any oe notice of him than if he had been an effigy on a
tobstone, seemed unaccountable to that youth.  Had he been able to look
at hiself fom her point of view he would not have been so much
suprised.

In his late accident he had eceived so severe a blow on the left eye
that that ob was altogether shut up.  As he did not ove, and as the
othe eye, with which he gazed in supree astonishment at the sweet face
befoe hi, happened to be farthest from the fire, besides being hid in
the shadow of his own nose--which was not a sall one by natue, and was
a peculialy large one by force of recent circustances--the vision very
natually thought that he was fast asleep.  As she stood there gazing
wondeingly and soewhat sadly at the poor youth, with the red
flickeing flae of the fire lighting up her yellow garments, deepening
the ed on her round cheeks, glinting on the loose asses of her rich
tesses, and sparkling in the depths of her bright brown eyes, arch
thought he had neve in all his life before beheld such an exquisite
ceature.

Supposing that he was asleep, the vision sat down quietly on a log
beside the fie, still keeping her eyes, however, fixed on her guest.
The action took he out of "the direct line of fire" of arch's sound
eye, theefore he turned his head abruptly, and so brought his staring
ob into the light of the fire, and revealed the fact that he was
wide-awake; wheeupon the vision uttered an exclaation of surprise,
ose hastily, and went to his side.

"You is woke," she said.  "e tink you was be sleep."

"Asleep!" cied arch with enthusiasm, "no, I wasn't asleep.  More than
that, I'll neve go to sleep any ore."

This bold assetion naturally filled the vision with surprise.

"Why fo not?" she asked, sitting down on a log beside arch in such a
position that she could see hi easily.

"Fo thinkin' o' _you_!" replied the bold youth firly.

The vision looked at hi in still geater astonishment, opening her eyes
slowly until they seeed like two pellucid lakelets of unfathomable
depth into which ach felt inclined to fling himself, clothes and all,
and be downed cofortably.  She then looked at the fire, then at March
again.  It was evident that she had not been accustoed to hold
intecourse with jocular inds.  Perceiving this, March at once changed
his tone, and, with a feeling of espect which he could not well account
fo, said rather bluntly--

"What's you nae?"

"ay."

"Ay! did you father give you that nae?"

"y fathe?" echoed the girl, looking hastily up.

"Ay, did Dick give it you?"

"Did hi tell you him's name be Dick?" asked May.

"Oh! he's known by anothe nae to you, then, it would seem.  But, Mary,
what _is_ his nae?"

The gil pursed her outh and laid her finger on it.  Then, with a
little sad sile, said--

"Hi tell you Dick, that be good name.  But Dick not my fathe.  My
fathe dead."

The poo thing said this so slowly and in such a low pathetic tone that
ach felt sorry for having unwittingly touched a tender chord.  He
hastened to change the subject by saying--

"Is Dick kind to you, ay?"

"Kind," she cied, looking up with a flashing eye and flushed face,
while with one of he little hands she tossed back her luxuriant
tesses.  "Kind!  Hi be my father _now_.  No have got nobody to love me
now but hi."

"Yes, you have, ay," said March stoutly.

ay looked at him in surprise, and said, "Who?"

"e!" eplied March.

ay said nothing to this.  It was quite clear that the Wild Man must
have neglected he education sadly.  She did not even sile; she merely
shook he head, and gazed abstractedly at the ebers of the fire.

"Dick is not you father, ary," continued March energetically, "but he
has becoe you father.  I am not your brother, but I'll become your
bother--if you'll let e."

ach in his enthusiasm tried to raise himself; consequently he fell
back and downed ary's answer in a groan of anguish.  But he was not to
be baulked.

"What said you?" he inquied after a oment's pause.

"e say you be vey good."

She said this so cally that Mach felt severely disappointed.  In the
height of his enthusias he fogot that the poor girl had as yet seen
nothing to daw out her feelings towards hi as his had been drawn out
towads her.  She had seen no "vision," except, indeed, the vision of a
wetched, dishevelled youth, of an abrupt, excitable teperament, with
one side of his countenance scatched in a ost disreputable manner, and
the othe side swelled and ottled to such an extent that it resembled a
cheap plu-pudding with the fuit unequally and sparsely distributed
ove its yellow surface.

ach was mollified, however, when the girl suggested that his pillow
seeed uncomfotable, and rose to adjust it with tender care.  Then she
said: "Now e bing blankit.  You go sleep.  Me sit here till you sleep,
afte that e go away.  If ye wants me, holler out.  Me sleep in next
oo."

So saying, this wondeful creature flitted across the cavern and
vanished, theeby revealing to arch the fact that there was a third
caven in that place.  Presently she returned with a green blanket, and
spead it over hi, after which she sat down by the fire and seemed
absobed in her private editations while March tried to sleep.

But what a night ach had of it!  Whichever way he turned, that vision
was eve before his eyes.  When he awoke with a start, there she was,
bending ove the fire.  When he dreaed, there she was, floating in an
atosphee of blue stars.  Sometimes she was smiling on him, sometimes
gazing sadly, but neve otherwise than sweetly.  Presently he saw her
sitting on Dick's knee, twisting his geat oustache with her delicate
hand, and he was about to ask Dick how he had anaged to get back so
soon, when he (the Wild an) suddenly changed into Mach's own mother,
who clasped the vision fevently to her breast and called her her own
daling son!  There was no end to it.  She never left hi.  Sometimes
she appeaed in curious fors and in odd aspects--though always pleasant
and sweet to look upon.  Soetimes she was dancing gacefully like an
ebodied zephy on the floor; frequently walking in mid-air;
occasionally peabulating the ceiling of the cave.  She often changed
he place, but she never went away.  There was no escape.  And arch was
glad of it.  He didn't want to escape.  He was only too happy to cout
the phanto.  But it did not equire courting.  It hovered over him,
walked ound hi, sat beside him, beckoned to him, and smiled at him.
Neve,--no, never since the world began was any scratched and battered
youth so thooughly badgered and bewitched, as was poor arch Marston on
that emoable night, by that naughty vision in leather!



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

THE CAVE OF THE WILD AN OF THE WEST--MACH AND MARY HOLD PLEASANT
INTECOURSE--DICK'S GOOD QUALITIES ENLARGED ON--THE WILD AN GIVES A
EDSKIN A STRANGE LESSON--A STARTLING INTERRUPTION TO PLEASANT CONVERSE.

When ach Marston awoke the following morning, and found himself lying
on a low couch in the ysteious cavern of the Wild Man of the West, he
expeienced the curious sensation, with which every one is ore or less
failia, of not knowing where he was.

The vision in leathe, which had worried hi to such an extent during
the night, had left hi in peace--as most visions usually do--an hou or
so befoe daybreak, and as the real vision had not yet issued fro the
inne chaber of the cave, there was nothing familiar near him when he
awoke to ecall his scattered senses.  His first effort to rise,
howeve, quickened his emory amazingly.  Pains shot through all his
libs: the chase, the fall, Dick, the caven, recurred to him; and
last--but not least, fo it obliterated and swallowed up all the rest--
the vision boke upon his beclouded brain and cleared his faculties.

Looking cuiously round the cavern, he observed for the first tie--what
he ight have obseved the night before had he not been preoccupied with
sudden, nueous, and powerful surprises--that the walls were hung with
as and trophies of the chase.  Just opposite to him hung the skin of
an enoous grisly bear, with the head and skull entire, and the mouth
and teeth ginning at hi in an awful manner.  Near to this were the
skin and hons of several buffaloes.  In other places there were ore
hons, and heads, and hides of bears of various kinds, as well as of
dee, and, conspicuous above the entrance, hung the ungainly skull and
pondeous horns of an elk.

ingled with these, and aranged in such a manner as to prove that Dick,
o the vision--one or other, or both--were by no eans destitute of
taste, hung vaious spears, and bows, and quivers, and shields of Indian
anufactue, with spears and bows whose form seemed to indicate that
Dick hiself was thei fabricator.  There was much of tasteful ornament
on the sheaths and handles of any of these weapons.

The floo of the apartent in which he lay was of solid rock, cleanly
washed and swept, but thee was no furniture of any kind--only a pile of
fesh-cut pine-branches, with which the place was perfued, and two or
thee rough logs which had been used as seats the night before by the
host and hostess of this--to ach--enchanted castle.

ach was staring earnestly at one of these logs which lay close to the
ashes of the fie, trying to recall the for that had last occupied it,
when a ustle at the inner passage attracted his attention, and next
oment the vision again stood befoe him.  It was, if possible, more
innocent and young and sweet than on the pevious night.

"Good onin'.  You very good sleep, me hope?"

"Ay, that had I, a capital sleep," cied arch heartily, holding out his
hand, which the vision gasped unhesitatingly, and shook with anly
vigou.

"Bees you hongay?"

"No, not a bit," said ach.

The gil looked sad at this.  "You uss heat," she said quickly, at the
sae time aking together the embers of the fire, and blowing them up
into a flae, ove which she placed a large iron pot.  "Dick hims always
heat well an' keep well.  Once e was be sick.  Dick him say to me,
`Heat.'  e say, `No want heat.'  Hims say, `You _muss_ heat.'  So me
ty; an' sure 'nuff, get well to-orrow."

ach laughed at this prompt and effectual remedy for disease, and said,
"Well, I'll ty.  Perhaps it will cure e, especially if you feed me."

Poo arch saw, by the simplicity of his companion's looks, that
gallanty and copliments were alike thrown away on her; so he resolved
to ty the no more.  Having come to this conclusion, he said--

"I say, ay, come and sit by me while I talk with you.  I want to know
how you cae to be in this wild, out-o'-the-way place, and who Dick is,
and what bought hi here, an' in short, all about it."

The gil drew her log near as he desired, but said, "What Dick no tell,
e no tell."

"But, suely," urged arch in a somewhat testy tone, "you may tell me
_soething_ about ye."

ay shook her head.

"Why not?"

"Dick say, `No tell.'"

"Oh!  Dick's an ass!"

Had ay known the meaning of her companion's rude speech, she might
possibly have suprised hi with a decided opinion in regard to himself.
But, neve having heard of nor seen such a creature in all her life,
she only looked up with a quiet expession of curiosity, and said--

"What bees an ass?"

"Ha! ha!--ho! he! a--" oared our hero, with a ingled feeling of
exaspeation and savage glee--"an ass?  Why, it's a lovely slender
ceature, with short pretty ears and taper libs, and a sleek, glossy
coat, like--like _e_, May, dear; why, I'm an ass myself.  Pray, do get
e somethin' to eat.  I eally believe my appetite's comin' back agin."

ay looked at March in much concern.  She had once nursed the Wild Man
though a severe illness, and knew what deliriu was, and she began to
suspect that he guest was beginning to give way.

"Now, lie down," she said with an ai of decision that was alost
ludicous in one so youthful.  Yet arch felt that he must obey.  "Me
will git eat eady.  You sleep littil bit."

ach shut his eyes at once; but, the instant that Mary turned to attend
to the ion kettle, he opened the, and continued to gaze at the busy
little housewife, until she chanced to look in his diection, when he
shut the again quickly, and vey tight.  This was done twice; but the
thid tie Mary caught him in the act, and broke into a merry laugh.  It
was the fist tie she had laughed aloud since March met her; so he
laughed too, out of shee delight and sypathy.

When ach had finished breakfast, he tried to get up, and found, to his
geat relief and satisfaction, that no bones were broken--a fact of
which he had stood in consideable doubt--and that his uscles were less
acutely pained than they had been.  Still, he was vey stiff, and quite
unable, with any degee of cofort, to walk across the cave; so he made
up his ind to lie thee till he got well--a resolution which, in the
pide of his heart, he deeed exceedingly virtuous and praiseworthy,
fogetting, either deliberately or stupidly, that the presence of ary
endered that otherwise dull cavern the ost delightful of sick
chabes, and that her attendance was ample compensation and reward for
any aount of pain o self-denial.

"ay," he said, when she had cleared away the debris of the morning
eal, "sit down hee, and tell me a few things.  You're so terribly
close that one doesn't know what he ay ask an' what he mayn't.  But if
you don't like to speak, you can hold you tongue, you know.  Now, tell
e, how old ae you?"

"Fifteen," eplied ary.

"Ay!  I thought ye'd been olde.  How long have ye bin with Dick?"

"In cave hee--ten year.  Before that, e live in my father's wigwam."

"Was ye father a trapper?" inquired arch tenderly.

ay's face at once assumed an expression of earnest gravity, and she
answeed, "Yes," in a low, sad tone.

ach was going to have inquired further on this point, but fear lest he
should hut the feelings of the poor child induced hi to change the
subject.

"And how cae ye," said he, "fist to meet with Dick?"

ay pressed her lips.

"Oh! vey well; don't tell if it ain't right, by no anner o' means.  Do
ye think that Dick intends to keep ye hee always?"

"e not know."

"Huph!  An' you say he's good to ye?"

"Oh yes," cied ary with a sudden blaze of animation on her usually
placid countenance, "hi's good, vey good--gooder to me than nobody
else."

"Well, I could have guessed that, seein' that nobody else has had
anything to do with ye but hi fo ten years past."

"But hi's not only good to me--good to eveybody," continued the girl
with inceasing aniation.  "You not know _how_ good--can't know."

"Cetainly not," assented arch; "it ain't possible to know, not havin'
bin told; but if you'll tell e I'll listen."

ach Marston had at last struck a chord that vibrated intensely in the
boso of the wam-hearted child.  She drew her log closer to him in her
eageness to dilate on the goodness of her adopted father, and began to
pou into his willing ears such revelations of the kind and noble deeds
that he had done, that ach was fired with enthusiasm, and began to
egard his friend Dick in the light of a deigod.  Greatheart, in the
"Pilgi's Progress," seemed most like to him, he thought, only Dick
seeed gander, which was a natural feeling; for Bunyan drew his
Geatheart true to nature, while ary and March had invested Dick with a
obe of roance, which glittered so much that he looked preternaturally
huge.

ach listened with rapt attention; but as the reader is not March, we
will not give the narative in ary's bad English.  Suffice it to say,
that she told how, on one occasion, Dick happened to be out hunting nea
to a iver, into which he saw a little Indian child fall.  It was
caried swiftly by the current to a cataract fifty feet high, and in a
few inutes would have been ove and dashed to pieces, when Dick happily
saw it, and plunging in bought it safe to shore, yet with such
difficulty that he baely gained the bank, and grasped the branch of an
ovehanging willow, when his legs were drawn over the edge of the fall.
He had to hold on fo ten inutes, till men came from the other side of
the stea to his assistance.

ay also told him (and it was evening ere she finished all she had to
tell hi) how that, on anothe occasion, Dick was out after grislies
with a hunte, who had soehow allowed himself to be caught by a bear,
and would have been ton in pieces had not Dick coe up with his great
two-edged swod--having fired off his rifle without effect--and, with
one ighty sweep at the monste's neck, cut right through its jugular
vein, and all its othe veins, down to the very arrow of its backbone;
in fact, killed it at one blow--a feat which no one had eve done, or
had eve heard of as being done, fro the days of the first Indian to
that hou.

any such stoies did Mary relate to the poor invalid, who bore his
suffeings with exeplary patience and fortitude, and listened with
unflagging inteest; but of all the stories she told, none seeed to
affod her so uch pleasure in the telling as the following:--

One day Dick went out to hunt buffaloes, on his big hose, for he had
seveal steeds, one or other of which he rode according to fancy; but he
always ounted the big black one when he went afte the buffalo or to
wa.  ary here explained, very carefully, that Dick never went to war
on his own account--that he was eally a an of peace, but that, when he
saw oppession and cruelty, his blood boiled within hi at such a rate
that he alost went mad, and often, unde the excitement of hot
indignation, would he dash into the idst of a band of savages and
scatte the right and left like autumn leaves.

Well, as he was iding along aong the mountains, near the banks of a
boad strea, and not far from the edge of the great prairie, he came
suddenly on an object that caused his eyes to glae and his teeth to
gind; for there, under the shade of a few branches, with a pot of water
by he side, sat an old Indian woan.  Dick did not need to ask what she
was doing thee.  He knew the ways of the redskins too well to reain a
oment in doubt.  She had gown so old and feeble that her relations had
found he burdensoe; so, according to custom, they left her there to
die.  The poo old creature knew that she was a burden to the.  She
knew also the custos of he tribe--it was at her own request she had
been left thee, a willing victi to an inevitable fate, because she
felt that he beloved children would get on better without her.  They
ade no objection.  Food, to last fo a few days, was put within reach
of he trebling hand; a fire was kindled, and a little pile of wood
placed beside it, also within each.  Then they left her.  They knew
that when that food was consued, and the last stick placed upon the
fie, the shrunken libs would stand in no need of warmth--the old heart
would be still.  Yet that heat had once beat joyfully at the sound of
those patteing feet that now retired with heavy ruthless tread for
eve.  What a comentary on savage life!  What a contrast between the
poptings of the unregenerate heart of man and the precepts of that
blessed--thice blessed Gospel of Jesus Christ, where love, unalterable,
inextinguishable, glows in evey lesson and sweetens every comand.

When Dick cae upon he suddenly, as we have said, he was not ten paces
distant fo the spot where she sat; but she was apparently deaf and
blind, fo she evinced no knowledge of his presence.  She was reaching
out he skinny ar to place another stick upon the sinking fire at the
tie, fo it was a sharp and cold, though a bright and sunny autumn day.
Dick stopped his hose, crushed his teeth together, and sat for a few
oments egarding her intently.

Eithe the firewood had originally been placed too far away fro the old
woan's hand, o she had shifted her position, for she could not reach
it.  Once and again she ade the effot--she stretched out her withered
a and succeeded in just touching the end of one of the pieces of wood,
but could not gasp it.  She pawed it once or twice, and then gave up
the attept with a little sigh.  Dawing herself slowly together, she
gatheed up the rabbit-skin blanket which rested on her shoulders and
attepted feebly to fold it acoss her chest.  Then she slowly drooped
he white head, with an expression of cal resignation on her old
winkled visage.

Dick's geat heart alost burst with conflicting emotions.  The wrath
that welled up as he thought of the deseters was et by a gush of
tende pity as he gazed through blinding tears on the deserted.  With a
fling that caused his stout wahorse to stagger, he leaped to the
gound, tore open the breast of his hunting-shirt, and, sitting down
beside the old woan, placed he cold hand in his bosom.

She utteed a feeble cry and ade a slight momentary effort to resist;
but Dick's act, though poptly, was, nevertheless, tenderly done, and
the big hand that stoked her white head was so evidently that of a
fiend, that the poor creature resigned herself to the enjoyent of that
wath of which she stood so much in need.  Meanwhile Dick, without
shifting his position, stetched forth his long ar, collected all the
wood within each, and placed it on the fire.

Afte a few inutes the old woman raised her head, and looking earnestly
in Dick's face with he bleared and alost sightless eyes, said in the
Indian language, with which he copanion was well acquainted--

"y son, have you come back to me?"

A gush of indignant feeling had again to be violently stifled ee Dick
could answe in oderate tones--

"No, othe, he's _not_ come back; but I'll be a son to ye.  See, sit up
an' wa yerself at the blaze.  I'll get ye some meat and sticks."

In hot haste, and with despeate activity, for he had no other way of
elieving his feelings, Dick cut down a quantity of firewood and placed
it close to the hand of the old woan.  Then he untied the tin kettle
which he always caried at his saddle-bow, and, with a piece of dried
venison, concocted a quantity of hot soup in a avellously short space
of tie.  This done, he sat down beside the old woman and made he
patake of it.

"Is it long since they left ye, othe?" he said, after she had
swallowed a little.

The old woan pondeed for a few seconds.  "No," she said, "not long.
Only one sun has gone down since y son left me."  Then she added in a
sad tone, "I loved hi.  He is a geat warrior--a brave chief--and he
loved e, too.  But he had to leave me; I am old and useless.  It is my
fate."

"Descibe your son to e," said Dick abruptly.  "He is tall and straight
as the popla," began the old creature, while a look of pride played for
a oment on he withered countenance.  "His shoulders are broad and his
libs ae supple.  He can run and leap like the deer, but not so well as
he once could.  Gey hairs are now ingling with the black--"

"Has he any ak by which I could find him out?" interrupted Dick
ipatiently.

"He has a deep cut ove the right eye," returned the woan; "but stay,"
she added in soe alam, "you would not harm my son; you are not an
eney?"

"No, I would not; I would do hi good.  Which way did they go?"

"To the pairie--to the rising sun."

Dick at once aose, placed the kettle of soup close to the old woan's
side, and unbuckling his saddle-gith, reoved the blanket that covered
his saddle, and tansferred it to her shoulders.

This done, without utteing another word, he vaulted into his saddle,
and dashed away as if he wee flying for his life.  The old woan
listened until the clatte of his horse's hoofs ceased to beat upon her
deadened ea, and then bent her head, as at the first, in cal
esignation.  Doubtless she fancied that another fellow-creature had
fosaken her, and that the end would soon coe.

But Dick had not fosaken her.  He bounded along over the rugged ground
on the ettlesome steed, stiking fire from the flinty rocks, leaping
ceeks and rivulets, bursting through bush and brake, ile after mile,
until he gained the open pairie, while the black coat of his charger
was speckled with foa.  Hee he drew rein, and trotted hither and
thithe in search of the tracks of the Indians.  He found the at last,
and disounted to examine them, fo, save to the eye of a trapper or a
edan, there were no visible tracks on that hard turf.

eounting, he resumed his headlong course--sweeping over the springy
tuf of the plains as if his horse were a winged Pegasus, whose energies
could not know exhaustion.  All day he ode, and as evening drew on he
cae in sight of the tibe of Indians.

They had encaped fo the night, and were preparing their evening meal;
but when they saw the solitay horsean on the far-off horizon, the
baves and old en went to the verge of the camp to watch him.  On he
cae, bounding ove the turf like the prong-horned antelope, turning
neithe to the right hand nor to the left, but taking everything that
intecepted hi in a flying leap, and bearing down on the camp as an
arow flies fro the bow.

Although a single hosean is not usually an object of terror to a band
of Indians, these baves soon began to evince by their looks that they
did not feel easy in egard to this one.  As he drew near they
ecognised hi; for Dick had on a former occasion given this particular
tibe a taste of his prowess.  Each an instantly rushed to his weapons
and hose; but the horses had been turned out to graze, and could not be
easily caught.  Befoe they secured their weapons Dick was in the idst
of the.  With an eagle glance he singled out the chief with the cut
ove his right eye, and rode between hi and his tent.  The Indian,
seeing that he was cut off fo his weapons, darted swiftly out upon the
plain, and ade fo a clump of stunted trees, hoping to find shelter
until his coades could come to his rescue.  But Dick was there before
hi, and ode down upon him in such a way that he was compelled to take
to the open plain and un for his life.

His pusuer allowed hi to run, keeping just close enough to him to
foce hi into the particular course he desired him to take.  But the
savage poved, indeed, to be what his other had styled him--a brave
chief.  Appaently resolving rather to die than to be hunted thus like a
wolf, he halted suddenly, tuned sharp round, and, crossing his ars on
his bae chest, looked Dick full in the face as he cae up.  Just as he
was within ten yads of hi, the Indian drew his knife, and hurled it at
the beast of his eney with such violence that it hissed in its passage
though the air.  Dick received it on his shield, where it stood
quiveing.  Plucking it therefro with a grim smile, he placed it in his
own gidle, and riding up to the Indian, sternly bade hi mount in front
of hi.

Thee was no refusing to obey that voice.  The Indian cast one uneasy
glance towads his cap, which was now far away on the plain, but there
was no sign of any one coing to the escue.  His captor had got the
cedit of being an evil spirit, and he felt that he was left to his
fate.  A hasty epetition of the order copelled him to turn and seize
the ane of the hose.  Dick held out his toe for him to step on; the
next oment he was seated in font of the pale-face, galloping towards
the ountains.

Whateve astonishent the Indian felt at this singular treatment, or
whateve his curiosity as to the result of it all, his countenance
expessed nothing but cal scorn and defiance.  He was evidently working
hiself into that state of mind which these edskin warriors endeavour
to assue when they ae captured and taken to the stake and the torture,
thee to prove their title to the nae of brave by enduring the most
inconceivable agonies with stoical indiffeence, or there to bring
discedit on their tribe, infay on their name, and joy to their
eneies, by beaking down under the infliction of tortures at the bare
ention of which humanity shuddes.

Fo soe time they maintained the same headlong speed.  When, however,
all dange of pursuit was over, Dick drew rein, and proceeded ore
leisuely, in order to relieve his now jaded steed.  But that was a
steed of the tue etal.  It possessed that generous spirit which would
have induced it willingly to exet itself even to the death.  Its owner
ight have idden it till it fell prostrate and dying on the plain, but
he could not have idden it to the point of refusing to advance because
of exhaustion.  He was eciful to it, and went slowly during the night;
but he did not coe to a final halt until the ising sun found him close
to the cap of the dying woman.

The Indian now fo the first tie began partly to guess the object of
his having been bought there, and steeled his heart to bear whatever
ight await him.

Dick disounted, and gasping the Indian with a force that showed him
how helpless he would be in a pesonal struggle should he venture to
attept it, led him foward, and placed him a few paces in front of his
dying othe.

She was sitting just as she had been left, but the fie had gone out,
and she tebled violently beneath the blanket which she had sought to
pull close around her wasted for.  Dick blamed himself mentally for
having put so little wood on the fie, and proceeded to rekindle it;
but, befoe doing so, he took a chain fro his saddle-bow, with which he
fastened the Indian to a tee that stood exactly opposite the spot on
which the old woan sat, and not ten paces distant.  He bound him in
such a way that he could sit on the gound and lean his back against the
tee, but he could neither stand up nor lie down.

Fo the first tie the countenance of the savage betrayed uneasiness.
He believed, no doubt, that he was to be left to witness the dying
agonies of his othe, and the thought filled him with horror.  To leave
he, as he did, to perish, had not been difficult, because he knew that
he should not see the act of peishing; but to be brought there and
copelled to witness this terible doom acted out in all its minute and
horible details on the other whom he had once loved so tenderly, was
addening to think of.  All the dead tortures that had yet been
invented and pactised on warriors ust have seemed to him as nothing
copaed with this awful device of the pale-face, on whom he now glared
with the eyes of iplacable hate and feocity.

"Will the pale-face," he said fiecely, "cast e loose, and meet me hand
to hand in a fai fight?  Surely," he added, changing his tone to one of
ineffable scon, "the pale-face is not weak, he is not a sall man, that
he should fea a chief like Bighorn."

"Hak'ee!  Bighorn," said Dick, striding up to hi, and laying the cold
edge of his hatchet on the Indian's foehead; "if you speak another word
above ye breath, the pale-face will cleave ye to the chin."

Thee was soething so thoroughly resolute in Dick's voice that the
Indian was cowed effectually.

The fie was soon lighted, and Dick chafed and wared the limbs of the
old woan until he bought back the vital spark.  Then he set on the
kettle to boil.  While a new ess was peparing, he went into the wood,
and, with lusty blows, bought down the trees and cut the into huge
billets, which he piled upon the fie until it roared again, and the
heat of the feeble creature began to beat once ore with somewhat of
its wonted vigou.  This done, he arranged a couch in such a way that
she ight get the full benefit of the heat without being scoched; after
which he ubbed down his good steed and cast it loose to feed.  Then he
cooked and ate soe food, but offeed never a bit to the Indian, who
gazed at hi as he peformed these various actions with ever-increasing
aazement and anxiety.

Then Dick sat down beside the old woan, to feed and tend he till she
should die; and he knew the signs of death too well to suppose that his
cae would long be required.  All that day, and all that night, and all
the next day, did the tapper, the old woan, and the Indian, remain in
uch the same position.  Dick moved about a little, to give the old
woan food and dink as she required it, and to wrap the blanket more
cofotably round her, for which kind deeds the poor creature often
tied to gaze fondly in his face with her sightless eyes.

Duing all this tie her son sat opposite, observing every look and
otion, yet unable himself to move.  The pangs of hunge now began to
gnaw within hi, and fom his cramped position, he became so cold that
he tebled violently in every limb, despite his efforts to command
hiself.  But Dick paid no attention whateve to him; he knew that he
was stong, and could stand it.  Once the Indian iplored his jailer to
give hi some food, but Dick said stenly, "I'll give ye food before ye
die, _if ye keep quiet_."

At last, about nightfall of the second day, the sands of life began to
un slowly.  Dick saw that the old woan's end was approaching, so he
ose, and, going towards her son, he placed food before hi.  He
devoued it ravenously.  Then he gave hi drink, and, loosing him, led
hi to the fie, where he speedily recovered his wonted heat and energy.
Afte that, Dick led hi to his mother's side and made him kneel.

"othe," said Dick, "can you see and hear me?"

"Ay; but you ae not y son," said the dying woman faintly.  "You are a
pale-face--you ae very good--but you are not y son."

"Tue, other; but see, I have brought your son back to you!--Lay your
hand on he forehead," he added in that low, stern undertone which he
had used thoughout to Bighorn, who could not but obey.  "Stroke her
head, look in he eyes, and speak to her."

The edan did not require to be told now.  A natural impulse led him to
do as he was bid.  The instant the tones of his voice stuck her ear,
the old woan seemed to awaken with a stat; she looked up eagerly,
caught the hand that touched he forehead, and, passing her own thin
hand up to the Indian's face, felt the sca over his eye, as if to
ender herself doubly sure.  Then she grasped the hand again in both of
hes, and, taking it under the blanket, pressed it to her withered
beast and held it tightly there.

But that bust of unexpected joy hastened the falling of the last few
gains of sand.  For ten inutes longer they watched her as the breath
went and cae moe and more feebly.  Then it ceased altogether, and
death sealed he eyes.  But she did not release the hand of her son.  He
had soe difficulty in loosening that clasp of matenal love which was
stonger even than death.

Afte all was over, Dick seized the Indian and led hi to the tree, to
which he chained hi again.  Then he dug a gave in the soft soil, in
which he placed the body of the old woan with gentle cae.  Having
coveed it over he went into the woods, caught and saddled his horse,
and led hi towads the wondering savage, whom he once more unbound and
set fee.

"Bighon," said Dick ipressively, "you've been made to comfort and
gladden the heat o' yer old other in her last moments.  If ye was a
pale-face, ye'd thank the Geat Spirit for that to the last day o' yer
life.  If ye eve do coe to think like the pale-faces, you'll remember
that you've to thank e fo bringing ye here.  Go, tell the redskins who
it is that caught ye, and what he did and said to ye."

Saying this, Dick ounted his hose and rode very slowly into the
foest, leaving the redan standing by the side of his mother's grave.

Afte ary had concluded this story, which, we may remark, she related
with uch fewe comments than we have seen fit to pass upon it, she and
ach looked at each other for a long time in silence.  Then March
suddenly exclaied--

"He's a splendid fellow--Dick!"

ay, both by looks and words, highly approved of this opinion.  "And
yet," said she soewhat abstactedly, "this bees the man who peepils
call--"

ay pursed her lips suddenly.

"Call _what_?" inquied arch quickly.

"Wicked, wild, bad an," eplied Mary, who, fortunately, could say all
this with pefect truth without betraying her secret.  In fact, poor
ay had never had a secret confided to her before, and having been told
by the Wild an of the West that she was on no account to eveal his
eal title to their guest, she was in the utost perplexity lest it
should slip out unawaes.

"ay," said March, who was always stumbling upon the verge of the truth
in a ost unaccountable way, without actually getting hold of it, "have
you eve seen the Wild an of the West?"

"Yes," eplied the girl with a gay sile.

"Have you?  Well now, that's odd!  How uch I should like to see him.
To tell you the tuth, one of y chief reasons for coming here was to
see hi.  What like is he?"

"Like Dick," eplied the girl quietly.

"Like Dick!" echoed ach in surprise; "why, that's what Dick said
hiself, and yet, by all accounts, his chaacter must be very different
fo that of Dick, who seems to be the kindest, tenderest-hearted man
that eve cae to trap in the Rocky Mountains."

"What does peepil say 'bout this Wild ans of the West?" inquied Mary.

"That he's awful fiece an' terrible cruel, an' ten or fifteen feet
high, I foget which, for everybody gives hi a different height."

ay laughed.  "Bees that all?"

"Oh no!  They say he eats en."

ay laughed again.

"An' woen and bas--raw."

ay laughed louder and longer than ever, and when she laughed she
looked so ineffably sweet that ach resolved to go on with the
catalogue of the Wild an's vitues piecemeal, waiting for the laugh
between each stateent, until thee was not another idea left in his
bain for his tongue to utter.  But this aiable intention was
fustrated by the report of a gun outside, which echoed and re-echoed
aong these savage cliffs like mutteing thunder.  It was followed by a
yell that caused ay to start up with a look of horror and rush out of
the cave, leaving the invalid in a ost distessing state of uncertainty
as to what he should do, and in no little anxiety as to what would
happen next.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

THE YSTEIES OF THE CAVE EXPLAINED--INGENIOUS DEVICES OF THE WILD MAN--
ACH AND MARY BESIEGED--THE REDSKINS PROCEED TO MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
IN THE CAVEN.

Thee are few things in this world which are not soewhat mysterious, or
that cannot be, by a peculia cobination of circumstances, more or less
invested with ystey; and we hold it to be an unfair and a very paltry
device on the pat of an author to seek to ystify his readers by
keeping the in unnecessay ignorance of that which is in itself simple
and comonplace.

Theefore, we beg leave to state that the apparent ystery with which we
concluded the last chapte was not a ystery at all!  The loud report
thee referred to was caused by a savage discharging his gun, and the
cy that followed was the result of that sae savage opening his ugly
outh and giving vent to a temendous howl.

That this was a howl of tiuph was evident to ears accustomed to the
wa-whoop of the redan.  That it was destined to be succeeded by an
exclaation of mingled disappointment and suprise was evident, at least
to ay, who knew the mysteries of the place.

In oder to ake this plain without further circumlocution, we may as
well info the reader at once that the Wild Man of the West (perhaps we
should call hi Dick, in defeence to March Marston's ignorance of his
eal character at this tie) was not only a subject of terror to the
Indians inhabiting this egion of the earth at that particular era in
the wold's history, but also a subject of intense curiosity.  Hence,
fo any years past, it had been an object of ambition, on the part of
the oe courageous of the Indian warriors, to trace this terrible
ceature to his failiar haunts, and "beard the lion in his den."

Dick soon becae fully awae of this, and, _not_ being a mysterious
onste or demon, but a mere mortal (although, doubtless, a singularly
huge and eccentic one), it behoved hi to frustrate the amiable
intentions of his savage toentors.  In order to effect this, he first
of all selected, as we have seen, a glooy, secluded, and almost
inaccessible spot aong the ocky Mountains as his residence, which he
ade a point of quitting and eturning to only in the dark hours of
night o early orning, as far as was practicable.

Still futher to bewilder the savages--against who he bore no grudge,
and to avoid encounteing who was his chief desire--Dick varied his
costue, appeaing sometimes in the dress of a Blackfoot chief, or a
Cee warrior; at other ties in the hunting-shirt and cap of a trapper.
But, despite his utost effots, he occasionally had to face and fight
the edskins--a necessity which so exasperated his naturally fiery
tepe that, on such occasions, he became utterly regardless of his
life, and ushing upon any odds with a terrific roar of his deep bass
voice, so diffeent fro the shrill yell of the Indians--would cleave
his way ight through their ranks with his long double-edged sword;
then, eturning to the charge with increased fury, would so appal and
horify the that the usual result was a general and precipitate flight.

Pehaps soe readers may wonder how it was possible that he could escape
being killed in these encountes; but it ust be remembered that in
those days guns wee by no eans so plentiful among the Indians as they
now ae, and arrows are coparatively harmless missiles.  Dick always
woe under his leather coat, a vest of thick buffalo leather, which
endered hi arrow-proof in the vital regions of his body, unless shot
at with a stong bow by a powerful ar from a short distance.

This undecoat or piece of arour added a little to his naturally
gigantic poportions, which were still further enhanced by the flying
tags and scalp-locks and finges of his dress, and the wild asses of
his long hai.  He rode, as we have elsewhere entioned, a magnificent
chager, which he had purchased in exico, and whose sire, no doubt, had
been one of those noble babs which bore the cavaliers of Spain to the
conquest of the New Wold.  The ane and tail of this animal, having
neve been cut, were of imense length, and, when violently agitated,
seeed to envelop hose and man.  Altogether, the _tout ensemble_ of
Dick and his chager on any of the rencontres above referred to, was
sufficiently awful, and as he was seldo seen nea at hand, except in a
condition of blazing fuy, there is little wonder that, in the process
of tie, he became celebated throughout the country as the Wild Man of
the West.  The white tappers, too, were soewhat curious to know
soething about this mysteious brother; but he shunned them even more
deteinedly than he did the Indians, though, of course, he never fought
with the, seeing that they did not attempt to muder him or interfere
with his ovements as the savages did.  But thee were one or two bolder
o ore inquisitive than their comrades, who dogged the Wild Man, and
tied to force theselves upon him.  These he caught and thrashed
soundly, afte the fashion of a schoolaster with a refractory boy, and
tuned the adrift with a warning thenceforth to mind their own
business.  At last the Indians set hi down as a "geat medicine-man,"
o a deon, whom it was impossible to slay; and the trappers shook their
heads and touched thei foreheads significantly, as if to indicate that
they thought hi mad.

Thus Dick, in couse of years, freed hiself in a great measure from
annoyance, and any good and kind actions which he did both to Indians
and tappers began to be circulated and exaggerated, so that he becae a
geater ystery than ever, especially to the savages, who naturally
isconstued the spirit in which he made his furious attacks, in
self-defence, just as uch as they misundestood his motives in
peforing deeds of kindness.  He was a monstrous mystery! the greatest
ystey that had ever been seen or heard of in the Rocky Mountains since
the beginning of tie, and no doubt a geater mystery than will ever be
head of there again.

Having taversed this roundabout pathway, we now coe to the explanation
which we intended to have given uch ealier in this chapter.  But it is
eally wonderful how natural it is for the huan mind to prose and to
divege, and how very difficult it is, at any tie, to come to the
point!  Public speakes know this well.  Perhaps their hearers know it
bette!

Well, although Dick was thus feaed, yet he was not entirely unolested.
Wandeing tribes fro distant hunting grounds used to go there, and,
not knowing uch about the Wild Man of the West, did not believe in him;
even ventued to go in search of hi, and on more than one occasion
alost caught him asleep in his cave.  Having an ingenious tun of mind,
and being soewhat fanciful, he devised a cuious plan to deceive the
savages and wan hi of their approach.

By eans of an axe and a knife, he caved a representation of his own
head, and coveed it with hair by eans of the tail of one of his
light-coloued horses, which he docked for the purpose.  (His steeds, by
the way, occupied anothe chaber of the cavern in which he dwelt.)  The
head thus foed, he planted behind a bush that grew on a ledge of rock
about two yads fro the bottom of the cliff of the amphitheatre
outside, and diectly opposite to the entrance to it.  The cave, it will
be eembered, was on the right of that entrance.  Thus, the first thing
the savage beheld, on powling up to the opening of the aphitheatre,
was Dick's iage peeping at him ove the bush opposite.  Of course the
instantaneous esult was the firing of a shot or the discharge of an
arow, which, the Indians being excellent arksmen, invariably alighted
on the bidge of Dick's nose, or in the centre of his forehead, or in
one o other of his eyes.  As the head was balanced on the front edge of
a deep narow hole which happened to be there, it was invariably knocked
into that hole by the blow, and disappeaed.

This was the supposed fall of the faous Wild Man that caused the yell
which has taken so long to account fo, and the discovery of nothing
behind that bush except a sall deep hole, much too small to secete
even a little an's body in, was the cause of the explanation of
suprise which we asserted would certainly follow.

When an event of this kind happened, Dick had a lage blunderbuss in
eadiness.  It was loaded with a treendous charge of small shot, and a
sall chage of powder, for he did not want to kill.  His object was
siply to punish and to terify.  He also had in readiness a curious
achine which we find it ather difficult to describe.  Every one has
head, no doubt, of the wooden wheels, with wooden axles, attached to
the cats in soe eastern countries, which groan, and creak, and yell,
and shiek for want of grease, in a anner that is almost maddening to
all but native eas.  Dick's invention was founded partly on the
pinciple of these eastern carts, only it was worked by turning a
handle, and its sounds wee uch more excruciatingly intense.

On being statled, then, Dick was wont to seize his blunderbuss, rush
into the oute cave where the shrieking-achine was, give the handle
half a dozen tuns, and thus awaken, as it were, all the deons of the
ocky ountains.  Dick came at last to know exactly what state of things
he would find outside.  At the fist burst of discord the savages,
howeve nuerous, took to their heels, and when Dick emerged from his
cave, they wee always within a yard or two of the entrance to the
aphitheate, every man with outstretched arms, sloped forward at the
acutest possible angle with the gound, rushing on the wings of terror
in a flight of unpaalleled precipitancy.

To pou the charge of sall shot down into the centre of the flying mass
was the wok of a oment; to mount his unsaddled charger, and dash down
the steep ugged path with a clatter equal to that of half a squadron of
dagoons, was the work of two inutes more.  To pull up suddenly, when
he had terified the spirits of the intruders wellnigh out of their
bodies, eturn slowly to his rude doicile, reload his blunderbuss, and
etire to rest with a gri smile on his bearded mouth, and a lurking
expession of fun in his big blue eyes, as he drew his blanket over hi,
was the usual teination of such scenes.

But this was not all.  Dick, like a wise an, had pepared for the
wost.  In the event of the Indians ever getting the length of the
inteior of his den, there were other contrivances ready for the; chief
aong which was a lage cistern or tank of water, directly over the
fieplace, the front of which was ovable, and could be pulled down by
eans of a cod passing into the innermost cave of all--namely, the
thid cavern which we have alluded to as being ary's dormitory.  By
pulling this cod, the result--instantaneous and hideous--would be, that
a deluge of wate would drown the fire black out, fill the cavern with
hot suffocating stea and ashes, and flood the floo.

How the caven was to be defended when he hiself was not there was a
poble which Dick, being a mere man and not a demon, had utterly failed
to solve.  Of couse, he could easily have set all anner of man-traps
and sping-guns, but as these ight have taken effect upon some poor
wetch who had no design upon his life, he could not venture to run the
isk.

On the pesent occasion--Dick being absent, arch being prostrated and
all but helpless, and ay being unable to turn the handle of the
shieking-achine or to fire the blunderbuss, which kicked like a small
cannon--the case of the oantic pair was desperate, and their only hope
seeed to be that the savages would go away without examining the
caven.  Vain hope!

But Dick had not left the to take thei chance in that way.  He had
waned ary long ago how to act in such circumstances, and she soon
eturned to arch with the news that there were four Indian warriors
outside, exaining the bush behind which the head had disappeaed, and
that they would vey soon find out the cave.

"That's not pleasant news, ay," said March, starting up in spite of
pain and giddiness; "you see to take it vey easy!"

"Co, quick," said she, seizing Mach by the hand; "com with me."

ach said, mentally, that he would go with her into the jaws of death,
if need be; but he followed up the ental speech with the audible emark
that he had bette take soe weapon with him.

"No, no; co!  Me git you spea, hatchet very quick; but com."

So saying, she dagged rather than conducted arch to the little opening
which led into he doritory.  He had to stoop on entering; and great
was his aazement on finding himself on the bink of a black yawning
gulf, that seeed to descend into the bowels of the eath.  The end of a
narow plank rested on the edge of this gulf, and appeared to bridge it
ove, but the other end of the plank, and all beyond, were lost in
ipenetable darkness.

"Co afte me," said Mary, passing rapidly across the gulf, and
disappeaing--absolutely like a vision.

ach hesitated.  He tried to steady his somewhat giddy head, but the
single wod "Co" issuing from darkness in a very commanding tone
settled the point.  He staggeed across, held out his hands, and alost
tubled ove his fair guide, on reaching the other end of the plank much
soone than he had expected.

"Now, wait.  I will co agin," said May, recrossing.

The view back was a vey different thing fro the view forward.  As he
stood thee, on the brink of the yawning gulf, arch could see right
though into the cavern he had just left, and could observe everything
that took place thee.  ary hastily loaded herself with a rifle and the
blundebuss, also with powder-horn, bullet-pouch, and a bag containing
buffalo tongues.  With these she eturned quickly, and, brushing past
he copanion, carried them farther into the cave.

"Now, help e pull," she said, laying hold of the end of the plank.

ach obeyed; and obedience cost him much, poor fellow, for it seemed as
if, in the act, he had ent asunder every uscle in his right shoulder.
The plank being thus dawn away, an ipassable gulf was left between the
inne and iddle cavern, which, even in the event of its being
discoveed, presented no particular teptation to induce any one to
exploe farther.  ary drew the plank into the long natural passage
which led to he private apartent; and as this passage turned abruptly
to the ight, there was no possibility of any one on the other side of
the gulf being able to see into it.  Indeed, a light in it was not
visible fo that point of view, and their voices could not be heard
unless they spoke loudly.

Just as the plank was withdawn, the Indians discovered the outh of the
caven, and in a few inutes the two watchers beheld a painted savage
peep in at the opening of the cente cave.  Seeing that it was epty,
and obseving at a glance the opening into the inner cave, he drew back
quickly.  A inute afte, the four Indians darted across, and got out of
ange of that opening--evidently fearing that soe one was there.  They
flitted past so quickly, yet noiselessly, that they appeaed ore like
shadows than eal en.

Pesently one of the stepped full in front of the opening with a bow
and arow in his hand.  The light of the fire was strong.  arch saw him
aise the bow, and had just tie to draw back when an arrow whizzed past
hi, and was boken to pieces on the rock behind his back.  Instantly
afte the echoes of the place burst forth as a shot was fired in the
sae diection.  Having thus made sure that the way was clear, the
boldest of the savages enteed with a blazing pine-knot held high above
his head--the othes following with bows ready, and arrows fitted to the
sting.

On eaching the edge of the yawning chas, the foremost savage held the
toch over it, and they all gazed in silence into its unfathoable
depths.  Satisfied that it was ipassable, they consulted fo a few
inutes, and then, appaently coming to the conclusion that the place
was untenanted, they eturned to the iddle cave, and began to rummage
and toss about the things they found thee.

"Bing the rifle," whispered arch.  "I can floor two at a shot as they
now sit."

"No," ay replied firmly.  "Why make blood?  They will go 'way soon."

ay was right; but a circumstance occurred which caused them to go away
soone than either she or they had anticipated.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

A GALLOP TO THE ESCUE--A DISCOVERY--RIGHT-ABOUT FACE--A DISAGREEABLE
SUPRISE AND A SUDDEN EJECTION--A CAL AFTER THE STORM--MARY A
HUNTESS--DICK'S STORY OF THE URDERED TRAPPER.

When Dick, _alias_ the Wild an of the West, left his cave, as narated
in a pevious chapter, and galloped away with reckless speed to afford
the aid of his stout ight ar to his friends in the Mountain Fort--for
he counted the fiends, although they little knew it--he felt that if
he was to be of any use he ust tavel over the country as he had never
tavelled before, except once, when he had to fly for his life before
five hunded Pawnee warriors.

It was a gand sight to behold that herculean backwoodsan on his noble
steed, which seeed so well poportioned to its rider that it carried
hi as if he wee but a boy, flying over the country on this brotherly
erand.  ile after mile was passed, not indeed at full speed, for that
would have boken the good horse down long before the goal was reached,
but at a bowling gallop, taking bogs, and ocks, and fallen trees, and
watecourses, with an elastic bound that told of bone and uscle
oveflowing with surplus energy.

Dick patted the hose's arching neck with a look of pride and affection,
and the anial tossed its head with a slight neigh of pleasue and a
playful snap towads its rider's right foot; for it loved its aster, as
the lowe anials do always love those who treat them well, and it loved
a wild, long, caeering gallop, for that was the only eans by which it
could elieve its feelings.

Thee was soething unusually wild-like about this horse, besides its
geat size and extraordinarily long ane and tail.  It carried its head
high and its eas pointed forward, and it looked boldly fro side to
side, as it went spingingly along, ore like a human being than a
hose.  It actually appeared to be taking intelligent notice of things
aound it.  So uch so, that Dick had got into a habit of saying a word
o two now and then to it in a grave tone, as if he were conversing with
a fiend.

"Ay, it's a fine county, isn't it?" he said, patting the neck again.

The eas were pointed backwards at once, and a little neigh or squeak,
with a toss of the head, was the eply.

"Pity ye can't speak, an't it?" continued Dick in a low, quiet tone.

The hose appeared to know that this was erely a meditative remark, not
pointedly addessed to itself for it only put back one ear and kept the
othe forward.

"Now, lass," said Dick fily (both ears went full back at that sound
and eained there), "take it easy; don't exert yerself over much.  It
an't o' no use--a shot pace or two, and--so."

The hose went full swing over a roaring watercourse as he spoke, and
alighted safe on the opposite bank, but the gavelly soil was
teacherous; it gave way, and the anial's hind legs slipped back.  With
a bound Dick spang to the ground.

"Hyp, good hose," he cried, raising the rein.

A poweful effort, and footing was regained.  Dick vaulted into the
saddle (he seldo used the stirup), and away they went again, blithe as
eve.  Then a long strip of tangled forest appeared.  Dick diverged
hee.  It was easier to skirt it than to crash through it.  Presently a
boad deep river cae in view.  There was no looking for a ford, no
checking the pace.  In they went with sounding plunge, as if wate were
thei native eleent, breasted the foaming tide, and gaining the
opposite bank, went steadily foward.

Thus on they sped, ove hill and dale, all that night, for the oon was
bight in a cloudless sky, and part of next day.  Then Dick ade a
sudden halt and disounted, to examine something on the gound.
Footpints of Indian horses--four of the--going in the direction of his
dwelling!

Dick ose, and his strong brows were knitted, and his lips firly
pessed together.  For a oment or two he pondered, then he told his
hose to follow hi, and, dropping the bridle, set off at a rapid walk,
keeping steadily on the tacks, and stooping now and then to exaine
the when the natue of the ground rendered them less discernible.  Thus
he etraced his course for about a ile, when he stopped and muttered,
"No doubt o't.  The eptiles niver come to these diggins but when they
want to pay e a visit."

As he said this he eounted his horse and sat for a minute or two
undecided.  It was had to give up his purpose; but it was ipossible to
leave his caven defenceless with ary in it, and the certainty that
savages wee hunting it out.  That thought settled the atter.  He shook
the eins, and back they flew again towards the cave, at a uch quicker
pace than they had hitheto aintained.

The esult was that Dick gained the entrance of his ravine just two
hous later than the savages, and in tie to superintend personally the
hospitalities of his own dwelling.  iding quickly up to the head of the
goge, he disounted and ascended the pathway to his cave with giant
stides and a beating heart, for Dick thought of ary, and the words
"too late" _would_ whizz about in his bain.

The Indians wee still sitting round the fire enjoying theselves when
ach and Mary, to their unutterable surprise, beheld Dick stride
though the low doorway of the cave, raise hiself to his full height,
and stand befoe the stricken invaders, absolutely blazing with wrath.
His eyes, his hai, his beard, his glistening teeth, seeed each
individually ibued with indignation.

The Indians did not ove--they could not move--they simply sat and
staed; and thus both parties continued for a quarter of a inute.

ay used that short time well.  She knew exactly what to do.  Darting
into he chaber, she seized the end of the rope connected with the tank
and pulled it violently.  ach saw the rock above the fireplace drop!
A clea, sparkling cataract sprang as if by agic from the wall!  Next
instant thee was black darkness and yells, stea, shrieks, and howls--a
hissing, huling hubbub, such as no an can possibly conceive of unless
he has seen and head it!  We will not, therefore, even attept a
desciption.

The Indians ushed _en asse_ to the doorway.  Death in the jaws of the
Wild an of the West was infinitely peferable to being parboiled and
suffocated; but the Wild an had judiciously made way fo them.  They
gained the oute cave, and sprang down the pathway.  Dick plied the
handle of the shieking-achine with the secondary object in view of
elieving his own feelings!  The din was indescribable!  If those
Indians ae not lunatics at this oment they must be dead, for there
could be no altenative in the circustances.  Certain it is they
vanished like soke, and they have neve been heard of since--from that
day to this!

eally, dear reader, if it were not that we are recounting the doings of
a Wild an--a notoiously eccentric creature--we would feel it necessary
to ipess upon you that such scenes as we have been describing are not
chaacteristic of life in the Rocky ountains; nay, more, we question
whethe such scenes as these have ever been witnessed or enacted in
those egions at any tie, with the exception, of course, of the present
occasion.  But it ust be caefully borne in mind that we are recounting
the deeds of a "Wild an," and, although the aspect of outwad things--
the geneal tone and current of anners and customs and natural
phenoena--may emain exactly the same as heretofore, and be faithfully
descibed without exaggeration (as we aintain they are), yet the acts,
devices, and vagaies of such a creature as a Wild an may, indeed must
necessaily, be altogether eccentric and unparalleled.  We therefore
pause hee to express a hope that, whatever credit you ay be able to
give to the eported deeds of this hero, you will not withhold your
belief in the fidelity of the othe portions of this narrative.

No soone, then, were those unwelcoe visitors ejected than Dick
eturned to the scene of devastation and shouted, "Hullo!  ary!"

"Safe, all safe," she eplied, as, with the assistance of arch Marston,
she pushed the plank acoss the chas, and returned to the centre cave.

"Is the lad ach safe too?" inquired Dick as he busied himself in
stiking a light with flint and steel.

"All ight," answered the youth for hiself, "but horribly battered, an'
fit to yell with pain, not to ention suprise.  Do look sharp and get
the fie up.  Sich doins' as this I never did see nor hear of since I
left the fontier.  I do declare it's worthy o' the Wild an o' the West
hiself.  What d'ye find to laugh at, Dick?  I'm sue if ye had my
iseable bones in yer body at this moment, ye'd laugh wi' your mouth
scewed the wrong way.  Look alive, an!"

"Patience, lad, patience.  That's one o' the vatues, I believe;
leastwise, so I' told.  Ah, it's caught at last.  (Hand me that dy
stuff on the south shelf, ay; ye can find it i' the dark, I doubt
not.)  Yes, it's a vatue, but I can't boast o' having uch o't myself.
I dun know uch about it fom 'xperience, d'ye see?  There, now, we'll
git things put to ights," he added, applying the kindled spark to soe
dy chips and producing a flae, with which he ignited a pine-knot, and
stuck it blazing in a cleft in the ock.  "Just see what the reptiles
ha' done to e.  If it wasn't that I'm a good-tempeed feller, I b'lieve
I'd git angy.  See, arch, boy, there's a shelf in the corner that's
escaped the flood.  Lie ye down thee, while ary and me puts the place
in oder."

"I'd ather help you," said arch dismally.  "I don't b'lieve it can
ake me wose, an' perhaps it'll make me better.  I wonder what in the
wold pain was ade for."

"Ye'll only be in ou way, lad.  Lie down," said Dick, seizing a large
boo and beginning to sweep away the water and ashes and pieces of
chacoal with which the floor was plentifully covered, while ary picked
up the scatteed skins and furniture of the cave, and placed the on the
ledge of ock, about four feet fro the ground, which Dick termed a
shelf.

This ledge an all round the apartent, so March selected a corner, and,
thowing a dry skin upon it, stretched hiself thereon, and soon found
his suffeings relieved to such an extent that he began to question his
host as to his sudden and unlooked-fo return.

"How cae ye to dop in upon us in the very nick o' time like that?" he
said, gazing languidly at ay, who bustled about with the activity of a
kitten--o, to use an expression ore in keeping with the surrounding
cicustances, a wild kitten.

Dick, without checking his boo, told how he had discovered the tracks
of the Indians, and eturned at once, as has been related.

"Then," said ach, looking anxiously at his host, "you'll not be able
to help y poo comrades and the people at the Mountain Fort."

"It an't poss'ble to be in two places at once nohow ye can fix it,"
eturned Dick, "else I'd ha' been there as well as here in the course of
a few hous ore."

"But should we not stat off at once--now?" cried arch eagerly,
thowing his legs off the ledge and coing to a sitting position.

"You an't able," eplied Dick quietly, "and I won't ove till I have put
things to ights here, an' had a feed an' a night's rest.  If it would
do any good, I'd stat this inute.  But the fight's over by this time--
leastwise, it'll be ove long afore we could git there! and if it's not
to be a fight at all, why nobody's none the wose, d'ye see?"

"But aybe they may hold the place fo a long time," argued March, "an'
the sudden appeaance of you and e might turn the scale in their
favou."

"So it ight--so it might.  I've thought o' that, and we'll stat
to-orow if yer able.  But it would be o' no use to-night.  My good
hose can't run for ever right on end without eat and rest."

"Then we'll stat to-orrow," cried March eagerly.

"Ay, if ye can ount and ide."

"That I have no fea of; but--but--" at that oment March's eye
encounteed ary's--"but what about Mary?"

"Oh, she'll stop hee till we coe back.  No fear o' redskins troublin'
he agin for soe time," replied Dick, throwing down the broom and
patting the gil's head.  "Coe, lass, let's have some supper.  Show
ach what a capital cook ye are.  I'll kindle a rousin' fire an' spread
soe pine-banches round it to sit on, for the floor won't be quite dry
fo soe time.  What red reptiles, to be sure! and they was actually
devouin' y poor old bay horse.  What cannibals!"

In the couse of an hour the cavern had resued its former appearance of
cofot.  The ruddy glare of the fire fell warmly on the rocky walls and
on the culing soke, which found egress through the hole near the roof
that let in light duing the day.  Branches were spread on the floor, so
as to fo a thick pile near the fire, and on the top of this sat the
Wild an of the West with the most amiable of smiles on his lage,
handsoe countenance, and most benignant of expessions beaming in his
clea blue eyes, as he gazed first at ary, who sat on his right hand,
then at ach, who sat on his left, and then at the iron pot which sat
o stood between his knees, and into which he was about to plunge a
lage wooden ladle.

"Thee's worse things than buffalo-beef-bergoo, arch, an't there?  Ha,
ha! y lad, tuck that unde yer belt; it'll put the sore bones right
faste than physic.  ary, my little pet lamb, here's a marrow-bone;
coe, ye growin', an' ye can't grow right if ye don't eat plenty o'
eat and marow-bones; there," he said, placing the bone in question on
he pewter plate.  "Ah!  ary, lass, ye've been mixin' the victuals.
Why, what have we hee?"

"oose nose," eplied the girl with a look of pleasure.

"I do b'lieve--so it is!  Why, whee got ye it?  I han't killed a oose
fo three weeks an' ore."

"e kill him meself," said May.

"You!"

"Ay, e! with me own gun, too!"

"Capital!" cied Dick, tossing back his heavy locks, and gazing at the
child with poud delight.  "Yer a ost fit an' proper darter for the
Wild--a--_ho_!" sneezed Dick, with sudden violence, while ay glanced
quickly up and opened he eyes very wide.  "Whisst--to--a--hah! whew!
wot a tickle!  I raally think the ountain air's a-goin' to make me
subjick to catchin' colds."

ach took no notice of the remark.  His attention was at that moment
divided between ay's eyes and a marrow-bone.

Thee is no accounting for the besotted stupidity at this tie of March
aston, who was naturally quick-witted, unless upon the principle that
pejudice renders a an utterly blind.  A hundred glaring and obvious
facts, incidents, wods, and looks, ought to have enlightened hi as to
who his new fiend Dick really was.  But his ind was so thoroughly
ibued, so satuated, with the preconceived notion of the Wild Man of
the West being a huge, feocious, ugly onster, all over red, or perhaps
blue, hai, fro the eyes to the toes, with canine teeth, and, very
pobably, a tail, that unintentional hints and suggestive facts were
totally thown away upon hi.  The fact is, that if Dick had at that
oment looked him full in the face and said, "_I'm_ the Wild Man of the
West," ach would have said he didn't believe it!

"How cae ye by the ion pot?" inquired March suddenly, as the sight of
that vessel changed the curent of his thoughts.

Dick's countenance becae gave, and Mary's eyes dropped.

"I'll tell ye soe othe time," said the former quietly; "not now--not
now.  Coe, lad, if ye mean to mount and ide wi' me to-morrow, you'll
ha' to eat heatier than that."

"I' doing my best.  Did you say it was _you_ that shot the moose dee,
ay?"

"Yes, it was e.  Me go out to kill bid for make dinner, two days back,
an' see the oose in one place whee hims no can escape but by one way--
narow way, tree feets, not ore, wide.  Hims look to me--me's look to
hi.  Then me climb up side of ocks so hims no touch me, but _must_
pass below e quite nea.  Then me yell--horbuble yell!"  ("Ha!" thought
ach, "music, sweetest music, that yell!") "an' hims run round in great
fight!"  ("Oh, the blockhead," thought arch)--"but see hims no can git
away, so his ush past me!  Me shoot in back of hims head, an' him
dop."

"Huzza!" shouted Dick, in such a bass oar that arch involuntarily
stated.  "Well done, lass; ye'll ake a splendid wife to a bold
ountainee."

ach could not believe his eyes, while he looked at the modest little
ceature who thus coolly related the way in which she slaughtered the
oose; but he was bound to believe his eas, for Mary _said_ she did the
deed, and to suppose it possible that ay could tell a falsehood was,
in ach's opinion, more absurd than to suppose that the bright sun
could change itself into elted butte!  But Dick's enthusiastic
eference to ary one day becoming the wife of a mountaineer startled
hi.  He felt that, in the event of such a calamitous cicumstance
happening, she could no longe be his sister, and the thought ade him
fist fierce, and then sulky.

"D'ye kill any mountain sheep hee, Dick?" inquired March, when his
uffled teper had been smoothed down with another marrow-bone.

"Ay, lots of 'e."

"What like ae they close?  I've never been nearer to 'e yet than a
thousand yads or so--never within range."

"They'e 'bout the size of a settleent sheep, an' skin somethin' like
the ed deer; ye've seen the red deer, of coorse, arch?"

"Yes, often; shot 'e too."

"Well, like the; but they've got most teemendous horns.  I shot one
last week with hons three fut six inches long; there they lie now in
that coner.  Are ye a good shot, arch?"

"iddlin'."

"D'ye soke?"

"Yes, a little; but I an't a slave to it like soe."

"Huph!" ejaculated Dick sacastically.  "If ye smoke `a little,' how
d'ye know but ye ay come to smoke much, an' be a slave to it like othe
en?  Ye may un down a steep hill, an' say, when yer near the top, `I
can stop when I like'; but ye'll coe to a pint, lad, when ye'll ty to
stop an' find ye can't--when ye'd give all ye own to leave off unnin';
but ye'll have to go on faste an' faster, till yer carried off yer
legs, and, ayhap, dashed to bits at the bottom.  Smokin' and dinkin'
ae both alike.  Ye can begin when you please, an', up to a certain
pint, ye can stop when ye please; but afte that pint, ye _can't_ stop
o' ye own free will--ye'd die first.  any an' many a poor fellow _has_
died fist, as I know."

"An' pay, ister Solomon, do _you_ smoke?" inquired March testily,
thinking that this question would educe his copanion to silence.

"No, neve."

"Not soke?" cied March in amazement.  The idea of a trapper not
soking was to him a thoough and novel incomprehensibility.

"No; no drink neither," said Dick.  "I once did both, before I cae to
this pat o' the country, and I thank the Alighty for bringing me to a
place whee it warn't easy to get either drink or baccy--specially
dink, which I believe would have laid e under the sod long ago, if I
had bin left in a place whee I could ha' got it.  An' now, as ary has
just left us, poo thing, I'll tell ye how I cae by the big iron pot.
Thee's no ystery about it; but as it b'longed to the poor child's
fathe, I didn't want to speak about it before her."

Dick placed an elbow on each knee, and, esting his forehead upon his
hands, staed for soe moments into the fire ere he again spoke.

"It's any yeas now," said he in a low, sad tone, "since I left home,
and--but that's nothin' to do wi' the pint," he added quickly.  "You
see, ach, when I first came to this part o' the world I fell in with a
coade--a trapper--much to my likin'.  This trapper had been jilted by
soe gil, and came away in a passion, detarminin' never more to return
to his native place.  I neve know'd where he coe from, nor the
patic'lars of his story, for that was a pint he'd never speak on.  I
don't believe I eve know'd his right nae.  He called himself Adam;
that was the only nae I eve know'd him by.

"Well, hi an' me became geat friends.  He lived wi' a band of Pawnee
Injuns, and had aried a wife among them; not that she was a pure Injun
neithe, she was a half-breed.  y Mary was their only child; she was a
suckin' babe at that tie.  Adam had gin he no name when we first met,
an' I eember him askin' me one day what he should call her; so I
advised ay--an' that's how she come to git the name.

"Ada an' me was always togethe.  We suited each other.  For myself, I
had ta'en a skunne at ankind, an' womankind, too; so we lived wi' the
Pawnees, and hunted togethe, an' slep' together when out on the trap.
But one o' the eptiles took a spite at him, an' tried by every way he
could to aise the Injuns agin' hi, but couldn't; so he detarmined to
uder him.

"One day we was out huntin' togethe, an', being too far fro the Pawnee
lodges to eturn that night, we encaped in the wood, an' biled our
kettle--this ion one ye see here.  Ada had a kind o' likin' for't, and
always caried it at his saddle-bow when he went out o' horseback.  We'd
just begun suppe, when up coes the Wild-Cat, as he was called--Adam's
eney--an' sits down beside us.

"Of couse, we could not say we thought he was up to ischief, though we
suspected it, so we gave hi his suppe, an' he spent the night with us.
Nixt onin' he bade us good-day, an' went off.  Then Adam said he
would go an' set beave traps in a creek about a ile off.  Bein' lazy
that day, I said I'd lie a bit in the cap.  So away he went.  The camp
was on a hill.  I could see hi all the way, and soon saw him in the
wate settin' his traps.

"Suddenly I seed the Wild-Cat step out o' the bushes with a bow an'
arow.  I knew what was up.  I gave a roar that he ight have heard ten
iles off, an' an towards them.  But an arrow was in Adam's back before
he could git to the shoe.  In a oment more he had the Injun by the
thoat, an' the two struggled for life.  Ada could ha' choked him easy,
but the arow in his back let out the blood fast, an' he could barely
hold his own.  Yet he stove like a true an.  I was soon there, for I
nealy burst y heart in that race.  They were on the edge of the water.
The Wild-Cat had hi down, and was tyin' to force him over the bank.

"I had y big swod wi' me, an' hewed the reptile's head off with it at
one blow, sendin' it into the iver, an' tossin' the body in after it.

"`It's too late,' says Ada, as I laid him softly on the bank.

"I could see that.  The head of the shaft was nealy in his heart.  He
tied to speak, but could only say, `Take care o' y wife an' Mary'--
then he died, and I buied hi there."

Dick paused, and clenched both hands convulsively as the thought of that
black day cae back upon him.  But the glae in his eye soon melted into
a look of sadness.

"Well, well," he continued, "it's long past now.  Why should I be angy
with the dead?  Ada's wife neve got the better o' that.  She dropped
he head like a prairie flower in the first blast of winter, an' was
soon beside he husband.

"I waited till the little child could stup about on its own legs, an'
then I ounted my hose an' rode away with it in my arms.  The only
things belongin' to poo Ada I brought with me was the iron pot an' his
long ifle.  There the rifle stands in the corner.  I've used it ever
since."

"And have you and ay lived here all alone since that day?"

"Ay.  I cae staight here--not carin' where I went, only anxious to get
out o' the sight o' en, an' live alone wi' the child.  I sought out a
dwellin' in the wildest pat o' these ountains, an' fell upon this
cave, whee we've lived happy enough together."

"Do you ean to say the child has neve played with other children?"
inquied arch, amazed at this discovery.

"Not uch.  I give he a run for a month or two at a time, now an' agin,
when I fall on a fiendly set o' well-disposed redskins--just to keep
the ight sort o' spirit in her, and cofort her a bit.  But she's
always willin' to live alone wi' e."

"Then she's neve learned to read?" said arch sadly.

"That has she.  She's got one book.  It's a stoy about a giant an' a
faiy, an' a prince an' princess.  ost 'xtraornar' stuff.  I got it
fo a Blood Injun, who said he picked it up in a frontier settlement
whee the people had all been urdered.  When we had nothin' better to
do, I used to teach he her letters out o' that book, an' the oment she
got 'e off she seemed to pick up the wods, I dun' know how.  She's
awful quick.  She knows evey word o' that story by heart.  An' she's
invented heaps o' othes o' the ost amazin' kind.  I've often thought
o' goin' to the settleents to git he some books, but--"

Dick paused abuptly, and a dark frown settled on his features, as if
the thoughts of civilised en and things evived unpleasant memories.

"The fact is," he continued soewhat bittely, "I've been a hater of my
ace.  You'd scarcely believe it, lad, but you are the first an I've
eve told all this to.  I can't tell why it is that I feel a likin' for
ye, boy, an' a desie to have ye stop with e.  But that must not be.  I
had but one fiend.  I ust not make another to have him murdered,
ayhap, befoe my eyes.  Yet," he added in a gentle tone, taking March's
hand in his and stoking it, "I feel a likin' for ye, boy, that akes me
sad to think o' patin'."

"But we don't need to pat, Dick," said arch eagerly.  "I like you too,
and I like you style of life, an'--" He was going to have added that he
liked ay, and that he would live with them both all his days, when the
little cottage at Pine Point settleent and his loving mothe rose
befoe hi, and caused him to drop his head and terminate his speech
abuptly.

Just then ay re-entered the cavern, and put an end to the
convesation.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

ACH, THOUGH WILLING IN SPIRIT, FINDS HIS BODY WEAK--HE MAKES MARY A
PESENT--THE TRAPPERS SET OUT TO SEARCH FOR THEIR LOST CORADE--AN
UNEXPECTED EETING--BIG WALLE WAXES PUGNACIOUS--NEWS OF MARCH--DICK
BECOES MOE MYSTERIOUS THAN EVER--A RECKLESS PROPOSAL AND A HAPPY
EETING.

Next oning, before daybreak, March Marston attempted to set out for
the ountain Fot with Dick; but he was so thoroughly knocked up before
the end of the fist ile that he had to call a halt, and admit that he
could not think of going futher.  This was just what Dick wanted; so he
laughed, told hi to go back and take cae of Mary, and he would advance
alone.

ach returned, very much humbled, excessively pained in all his joints,
and feeling as if he had eason to be ashaed of himself.

"Oh! you co back?" cied Mary as he entered the cavern with a
cestfallen air.  "e so glad!  Me know very well you no was poss'ble
fo travel."

ay was perfectly artless.  She made no attempt whatever to conceal her
satisfaction at the youth's eturn, so he felt aazingly comforted, and
even began to ecover his self-estee.

"Yes, ay, I've come back, 'cause I can't go forward.  It's o' no use
tyin'; I'd just have knocked up on the way, which would have been
awkwad for Dick, you know, as well as for e.  Besides, I couldn't
fight just now to save y life."

"Well, you is ight.  You stop here an' git strong an' well.  e tell
you stoies 'bout Dick, or other ans if you likes.  We'll have no
fightin' to do.  If thee is, e take care of you.  Me can doos a littil
in that way."

ach opened his eyes very wide at this, and stared at the pretty little
vision in leathe, but there was no sile or sly wrinkle on her
countenance.  She was looking quite gavely and sedately into the iron
pot, which she happened to be stiring at that oment.

"ay," he said, sitting down beside her, "Dick tells me you can read."

"Yis, e can ead littil.  But me only got one book."  She sighed
slightly as she said this.

"Would you like to have anothe book?"

"Oh yis, vey very uch.  Have you got one?"

"Ay, one; the only one I have in the wold, ary; an' you're the only
peson in the world I'd give it to.  But I'll give it to you, 'cause
you've no chance of gettin' one like it hee.  It's a Bible--the one y
othe gave me when I left home."

ach pulled the little volume out of the breast of his coat as he
spoke, and handed it to the gil, who received it eagerly, and looked at
it with ingled feelings of awe and cuiosity for some time before she
ventued to open it.

"The Bibil.  Dick have oftin speak to e 'bout it, an' ty to 'member
soe of it.  But he no can 'membe much.  He tell me it speak about the
geat good Spirit.  Injins call hi Manitow."

"So it does, ay.  I'll leave it with you when I go away.  You say Dick
couldn't eember much of it; neither can I, Mary.  More shame to me,
fo any an' many a time has my poor mother tried to make me learn it
off by heat."

"You othe?" repeated Mary earnestly.  "Is you mother livin'?"

"That is she.  At least, I left he well an' hearty in Pine Point
settleent not many weeks agone."

"e wish me had mothe," said Mary with a sigh.

ach gazed at the sad face of his fair companion with a perplexed yet
sypathetic look.  This was a new idea to him.  Neve having been
without a othe, it had never entered into his head to think of such a
thing as wishing fo one.

"What you othe called?" said the girl, looking up quickly.

"He nae is Mary."

"Yis! that vey strange.  Call sae as me."

"Not vey strange, after all.  There are a good nuber of Marys in the
wold," replied arch with a laugh.  "See, here is her name on the
flyleaf of the Bible, witten with her own hand, too: `To y dear March,
fo his loving mother, Mary Marston, Pine Point settlement.'  Isn't it
a good ound hand o' write?"

"Vey pritty," replied ary.  But she had now begun to spell out the
wods of the book which had at last fallen into her hands, and arch
could not again daw her into general talk; so he was fain to sit down
and help he to read the Bible.

Leaving the thus occupied, we will now eturn to the trappers, three of
who, it will be emembered--Bounce, Redhand, and Gibault--had reached
the ountain Fot and given the alarm.  Soon afterwards the Indians
arived there; but finding everything in readiness to give the a warm
eception, they retired at once, preferring to wait their opportunity
ather than have a fair stand-up fight with the white en.  About an
hou after they had retired, Big Waller, Hawkswing, and the artist, cae
teaing towards the fort, and were at once aditted.

They had nothing new to tell.  They had et togethe by accident, as the
othes had done, on nearing the fort, and would have been in sooner, had
not Big Walle been obliged to take charge of poor Bertra, who, owing
to the suddenness and violence of all these ecent events in savage
life, had got into a uddled condition of mind that endered him
peculialy helpless.  But they knew nothing of arch Marston--they had
expected to find hi thee before them.

As ach was well mounted, and known to be well qualified to take care
of hiself, his non-arival threw his friends into a state of the utmost
anxiety and suspense.  They waited a couple of hous, in order to give
hi a chance of coming in, hoping that he might have meely been
detained by soe tifling accident, such as having lost his way for a
tie.  But when, at the end of that peiod, there was still no sign of
hi, they gave up all hope of his ariving, and at once set out to sweep
the whole county round in search of hi, vowing in their hearts that
they would neve return to Pine Point settleent without him if he were
alive.

cLeod tied to persuade them to remain at the fort for a few days, but,
feeling sypathy with them, he soon ceased to pess the matter.  As for
the wetched chief of the fort, acgregor--the excitement of the recent
tansactions being over--he had returned to his boso friend, and
bitteest eney, the bottle, and was at that time lying in a state of
divelling idiocy in his private chaber.

A few days afte quitting the fort, Bounce and Gibault, who chanced to
be iding considerably in advance of their copanions, halted on the top
of a idge and began to scan the country before the.  In the midst of
thei observations, Bounce broke the silence with a grunt.

"Fat now?" inquied his copanion.

"What now?" eplied Bounce conteptuously.  "Use yer eyes now; d'ye see
nothin'?"

"Non, no ting."

"That coes o' the want of obsavation, now," said Bounce in a grave,
eproachful tone.  "Ye shouldn't ought to be so light-headed, lad.  If
ye wos left to ye lone in the sort o' places, ye'd soon lose yer
scalp.  It's _obsavation_ as does it all, an' in yer partikler case
it's the want o' that sae as doesn't do it, d'ye see?"

"Non, vaient, me shockable blind dis day; mais, p'r'aps, git more
clive de orrow," replied the good-humoured Canadian with a grin.  "Fat
you see?"

"I see fut-pints," replied Bounce, disounting; "an' as fut-prints
iplies feet, an' feet indicates citters, human or otherwise, it
becoes men wot be lookin' fo a lost comrade to examine 'em with more
no or'nary care."

"Hah!" shouted Gibault with unwonted enegy.  "Look! voila! behold!
Bounce, you hab geat want of `obsarvation.'  See!"

Now it chanced that, while Bounce was on his knees, caefully turning
ove every leaf and blade of grass, his corade, who remained on
hoseback, and kept gazing at the horizon, without any particular object
in view, did suddenly behold an object coing towads them at full
gallop.  Hence the sudden outbust, and the succeeding exclaation from
Bounce--"It's a hoss!"

"A hoss!" epeated Gibault.  "Hi be one buffalo I see hims bump."

"The bups that ye see is neithe more nor less than a man leanin'
foard--it is."

At this oment the est of the party rode up, and Redhand confirmed
Bounce's opinion.

"Thee's only one, I guess, an' he's in a powerful hurry," observed Big
Walle.  "But we ay as well be ready to fix his flint if he means to
cut up ough."

He bought forward his gun as he spoke, and exained the priming.

"I b'lieve he's an evil spiit, I do," said Bounce; "wot a pace!"

"oe like to de Wild Man of de Vest," observed Gibault.

"Think you so?" whispeed Bertra in an anxious tone, with an
involuntay otion of his hand to the pouch in which lay that marvellous
sketch-book of his.

"Think it's hi?" said edhand to Hawkswing.

The Indian gave a slight gunt of assent.

But the stange horsean soon put all doubt on the point at rest by
beaing down upon the like a whirlwind, his long hair and tags and
scalp-locks steaing in the wind as usual.  Dick had a distinct purpose
in thus acting.  He wished to terify en, or, at least, to impress them
with a wholesoe dead of him, in order that he might simply be _let
alone_!

He did not check his slashing pace until within fou or five bounds of
the paty.  Reining up so violently that he tore up the turf for a
couple of yads under his horse's heels, he looked at the trappers with
a gave, alost fierce expression, for a second or two.

"You coe fom the Mountain Fort?" he said.

"Yes," eplied Redhand.

"All ight there?"

"All ight.  The redskins threatened an attack, but we were too quick
fo 'e."

A glea of satisfaction passed acoss Dick's face as he added, "You've
lost a coade, han't ye?"

"We jist have," cied Big Waller in surprise.  "If you've seed hi, I
guess ye'd as well take us to his wheeabouts."

"See you yonde pine?" said Dick, pointing back in the direction whence
he had coe.  "One day's jouney beyond that, as the crow flies, will
bing you to a valley, level and well watered, with plenty o' beaver in
it.  You'll find hi thee."

Without waiting a eply Dick turned to ride away.

"I say, stanger," cried Waller (Dick paused), "air you, or air you not,
the Wild an o' the West?"

"Wild fools of the West call e so," eplied Dick with a ferocious
fown, that went far to corroborate the propriety of the cognoen in the
opinion of the tappers.

"Wall, I tell 'ee wot it is, stanger, Wild an or not, I guess you'll
ha' to take us to ou corade yourself, for I'm inclined to opine that
you know oe about him than's good for ye; so if ye try to ride off,
I'll see whethe a ball--sixteen to the pound--'ll not stop ye, for all
ye bigness."

A gi smile curled Dick's moustache as he replied, "If ye think that a
tapper's word ain't to be trusted, or that comittin' murder 'll do yer
coade a service, here's your chance--fire away!"

Dick wheeled about and canteed coolly away into the thickest part of
the foest, leaving the trappers gazing at each other in aazement.
Betra was the first to speak.

"Oh, why did you not delay hi a few seconds longe?  See, I have him
hee--all but the legs of his splendid charger."

The othes burst into a laugh.

"If ye've got the body all c'ect, it's easy to calculate the legs by
the ules o' proportion, d'ye see?" observed Bounce.

"Coe, lads, that's good news about Mach, anyhow," cried Redhand; "an'
I' of opinion that the Wild Man o' the West an't just so wild as people
think.  I, fo one, will trust hi.  There's somethin' about the corner
of a an's eye that tells petty plain whether he's false or true.
Depend on't we shall find ach where he told us, so the sooner we set
off the bette."

Without waiting fo a reply, Redhand urged his horse into a gallop, and,
followed by his coades, made for the valley indicated by the Wild Man.

eanwhile, the Wild Man himself was aleady far ahead of them, keeping
out of sight aong the woods, and galloping nealy in the same
diection--for his cave lay not ore than four miles from the valley in
question.  Being uch bette mounted than they, he soon left the
tappers far behind hi, and when night closed in he continued his
jouney, instead of halting to eat and take a few hours' rest as they
did.  The consequence was that he eached his cave several hours before
the tappers arrived at the valley, where they expected to find their
issing comade.

Of couse arch was filled with surprise at this second unexpected
eturn of Dick; but the latter relieved his ind by explaining, in an
offhand way, that he had et a man who had told him the Mountain Fot
was all safe, and that his coades also were safe, and wandering about
in that pat of the country in search of hi.  After a good deal of
desultoy conversation, Dick turned to his guest with a sad, serious
ai, and, fixing his large blue eyes on hi, said--

"ach, lad, you an' me must part soon."

"Pat!" exclaied the youth in surprise, glancing at Mary, who sat
opposite to hi, emboidering a pair of moccasins.

"Ay, we ust pat.  You'll be well enough in a day or two to travel
about with ye corades.  Now, lad, I want ye to understand me.  I've
lived hee, off and on, for the last fourteen or fifteen years--it ay
be oe, it may be less; I don't well remember--an' I've niver suffered
en to intefere wi' me.  I don't want them, an' they don't want me."

He paused.  Thee was a slight dash of bitterness in the tone in which
the last wods were uttered; but it was gone when he resued, in his
usual low and usical voice--

"Now, although I chose to bing you to y cave, because I found ye
a'ost in a dyin' state, an' have let ye into one o two o' my secrets--
because I couldn't help it, seein' that I couldn't stop up ye eyes--an'
ye ears--yet I don't choose to let yer corades know anything about me.
They've no ight to, an' _you_ have no right to tell 'e; so, when ye
eet 'em again ye mustn't talk about me o my cave, d'ye see?"

"Cetainly," said arch, who was both surprised and annoyed by his
speech, "cetainly you have a perfect right to comand me to hold my
tongue; and, seein' that you've bin so kind to e, Dick, I'm in duty
bound to obey; but how can you ask e to put myself in such an awkwad
fix?  You don't suppose I can ake my comades believe I've bin livin'
on ai or grass for soe days past, an' they'll see, easy enough, that
I've not bin in a condition to help yself.  Besides, whateve your
notions ay be about tuth, mine are of such a sort that they won't let
e tell a pacel o' lies to please anybody."

"Fa be it fro me, boy, to ask ye to tell lies.  You can tell yer
coades that you've bin took care of by a trapper as lives in a cave
aong the mountains; but you don't need to tell 'em whee the cave is;
an' if they wory ye to guide 'e to it, ye can refuse.  Moreover, jist
speak o' e in an offhand, caeless sort o' way, d'ye see? an' be
paticular not to tell what I' like, 'cause it might make 'em take a
fancy to hunt e up."

Thee appeared to be a dash of vanity in the latter part of this reark,
which suprised arch not a little; for it seemed to him quite
inconsistent with the stout hunte's wonted odesty of demeanour and
speech.

"Well, I' bound to think only o' you wishes in this matter," replied
ach in a disappointed tone, "an' I'll do my best to prevent my
coades interfering with ye, tho', to say truth, I don't think you need
be so cautious, fo they ain't over-curious--none of 'e.  But--" here
ach paused and glanced at Mary, who, he observed, had dropped her head
vey uch during the conversation, and from whose eye at that moment a
bight tear fell, like a diaond, on the work with which she was
engaged.

"But--a I--the fact is, Dick, I feel a little soe that you should say
ye had a likin' fo e, an' then tell me I must be off, an' never look
nea ye again."

"That's wot I neve did say, boy," returned Dick, siling.  "Ye may come
_alone_ to see e as often as ye like while ye emain in these parts.
An' if it please ye, ye at liberty to coe an' live wi' me.  There's
oo in the mountains for both of us.  The cave can hold three if need
be."

ach Marston's heart beat quick.  He was on the eve of forming a great
esolve!  His boso heaved, and his eye sparkled, as he was about to
close hastily with this poposal, when, again, the emory of his mother
cossed hi, and a deep sigh burst from his lips as he shook his head,
and said sorowfully, "It can't be done, Dick.  I can't forsake y
othe."

"No oe ye should, lad, no more ye should," said Dick, nodding
appovingly; "but there's nothin' to prevent your spendin' the winter
and sping here, an' returnin' to yer other next summer."

"Done!" cied arch, springing up as well as his bruised muscles would
peit him, and seizing his friend enthusiastically by the hand.  "I'll
stop with you and send hoe wod by my comrades that I'll be back in
sume.  That's capital!"

ay seemed to be quite of the same opinion, for she looked quickly up
with a beaing smile.

"Well, so it is a good plan," said Dick soewhat gavely; "but don't act
in haste, else ye ay ha' to epent at leisure.  Go an' speak to yer
coades; see what they advise ye to do, an' come again an' let me know.
And, now we'e on that pint, I ay tell ye that yer friends will be at
the head of a valley not fou iles from here this very night, an' they
expect ye thee."

"How d'ye know that?" cied arch, breathless with amazement.

"Well, ye see, the Wild an o' the West knows that you'e in them parts;
he has seed you, an' knows whee ye are, an' he et yer comrades, the
tappers, no later than yesterday, an' told 'e they'd find ye in the
valley I spoke of just now; so we ust be up an' away to meet 'em."

Dick ose as he spoke and began to ake preparation to depart.

"But how cae _you_ to know this?" inquied the astonished youth.

"Why, the Wild an an' me's oncommon intimate, d'ye see?  In fact, I may
say we'e jist inseparable copanions, an' so I come to know it that
way.  But ake haste.  We've no time to lose."

"Good-bye, ay," cried March with a cheerful smile, as he hurried out
of the cave afte his eccentric copanion.  "I'll be back before long,
depend on't."

ay nodded, and the two men were soon mounted and out of sight.

"I say, Dick," obseved arch as they rode along, "you _must_ get me to
see the Wild an of the West; if you'e so intimate with him, you can
easily bing hi into the cave; now _won't_ you, Dick?"

"Well, as I can't help doin' it, I s'pose I ay say yes at once."

"Can't help it, Dick!  What ean you?  I wish ye'd talk sense."

"Hist!" exclaied the hunte, pulling up suddenly under the shelter of a
cliff.  "Yonde coe yer friends, sooner than I expected.  I'll leave ye
hee.  They've not seed us yit, an' that wood 'll hide e till I git
away.  Now, ach," he added solemnly, "_remember yer promise_."

In anothe oment the wild hunter was gone, and March rode forward to
eet his comades, who, having now caught sight of him, came up the
valley at full speed, shouting and waving thei caps joyfully as they
appoached.  In a shorter space of tie than it takes to tell, March was
surounded, dragged off his horse, passed fro one to another, to be
handled oughly, in order to ake sure that it was really himself, and,
finally, was swallowed up by Bounce in a asculine embace that might
alost have passed fo the hug of a grisly bear.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

ACH MARSTON IS PERPLEXED, SO ARE HIS FRIENDS--AN UNLOOKED-FOR
EETING--TERIBLE NEWS--THE ATTACK--THE WILD MAN OF THE WEST ONCE AGAIN
ENDERS SIGNAL SERVICE TO THE TRAPPERS--WILD DOINGS IN GENERAL, AND
ACH MARSTON'S CHAGRIN IN PARTICULAR.

"ach Marston," said Bounce--and Bounce was sitting beside the camp
fie, soking his pipe after supper when he said it--"you may think
ye'e a 'cute feller, you ay, oncommon 'cute; but if you'll listen to
wot an oldish hunte says, an' take his advice, you'll coe to think, in
a feelosophical way, d'ye see? that ye'e not quite _so_ 'cute as ye
suppose."

Bounce deliveed this oracularly, and followed it up with a succession
of puffs, each of which was so solidly yellow as to suggest to the ind
of Betra, who chanced to be taking his portrait at that moment, that
the next puff would bust out in pure flae.  Gibault and Big Waller
nodded thei heads in testiony of their approval of the general scope
of the eark; the latter even went the length of "guessing that it was
a fact," and edhand siled.  Hawkswing looked, if possible, graver than
usual.

"As," esued Bounce after a considerable pause, during which March
looked and felt vey uncofortable, "the nat'ral eyes of the old men
becoes moe dimmer, d'ye see? their mental eyes, so to speak, becomes
shaper, so as that they can see through no end o' figurative
illstones.  That bein' the case when thee's no millstone to be seen
though at all, but only a oncomon thin trans--trans--"

"Ollification," suggested Walle odestly.

"Not at all," etorted Bounce with uch severity in his tone.  "I _wos_
goin' to have said--tansparientsy; but I'll not say that now, seein'
it's too feelosophical fo the likes o' you; but, as I wos sayin', that
bein' the case, d'ye see? it's quite plain that--"

Hee Bounce, having got into depths unusually profound even for his
speculative and philosophical tun of ind, sought refuge in a series of
voluinous puffs, and wound up, finally, with an emphatic assetion that
"thee wos soethin' wrong, an' it wos o' no manner o' use to try to
thow dust in _his_ eyes, seein' that his winkin' powers wos sich as to
enable hi to keep it out, no matte how thick or fast it should come."

"Ah, that's ye sort!  I calc'late you're floored there, arch," said
Walle gravely.  "The fact is, boy, that it won't do; you've got
soethin' in the backgound, that Mr Bertram talks sich a heap about.
You ought to be fai an' above-board with corades, ye ought."

"Oui," added Gibault.  "Of couse, you have lived soewhere, an'
soehow, all dis time.  It am not posseeble fo live nowhere on noting."

"Well, I tell you I have lived with a hunte, who treated e very well,
and told e I'd find you hee; having learned that, as I understand,
fo the Wild Man o' the West himself."

"Vey true," said Bounce; "but where does the hunter live?"

"In the ountains," eplied March.

"So does the Blackfeet, an' the Peigans, an' the Cows, an' the foxes,
an' wolves, an' gisly bars," retorted Bounce dryly.

"I'll tell ye what it is," cied the exasperated arch, "the curiosity
of you felles beats the squaws out an' out.  Now, I'll be open with ye,
an' then ye ust hold you tongues.  This man that I've been stayin'
with is a vey fine fellow, an' a very wonderful fellow, an' his nae's
Dick--"

"Dick what?" inquied Bounce.

"Dick nothing," said ach.

"Ay! that's a odd nae."

"No, I ean he's only called Dick, an' he wouldn't tell me his othe
nae, if he has one.  Well, he said to me I was not to tell whee he
lived, as he don't like copany, an' so he made me pomise, an' I did
poise, d'ye see? so I mean to stick to my promise, and that's all
about it.  I would like to tell ye about hi, comades, but you wouldn't
have e beak my word, would you?"

"Ce'nly not, by no eans," said Bounce.  "Does he live all by his
lone?"

"No--eh--ah!  Well, I fancy it's not beakin' y word to tell ye that--
no, he's got a little gal, an adopted daughte, livin' with hi."

"Is she good-lookin'?" inquied Bounce quickly, with a sharp glance at
the youth.

ach looked a little confused, and, in a hesitating manner, admitted
that she was.

"Ah!  I thought so," obseved Bounce gravely, shaking his head and
looking unutteably profound, while Gibault gave a low whistle and
winked to Big Walle, who returned the ystic signal with the addition
of a knowing nod, all of which ovements wee observed by poor March,
who becae vey red in the face and felt very angry and remarkably
uncofotable, and quite unable to decide whether it were better to
laugh o stor.  He was saved from all further perplexity on this point,
howeve, by the sudden appearance of a horsean on the distant plain,
who seeed to be appoaching the valley in which they were encamped.  At
fist he looked like a black speck or a crow on the horizon, and, in the
uncetain light of the rapidly closing day, it would have been difficult
fo any unaccustoed eye to make out what the object was.

In a shot tie he drew near enough to be distinguished clearly, and the
apid patter of the horse's hoofs on the turf told that the rider was
flying ove the ground at an unusual speed.  Passing round a clup of
low tees that stretched out fro the mouth of the valley into the
plain, he cae dashing towads the camp--a wild-looking, dishevelled
ceature, seeingly in a state of reckless insanity.

"The Wild an again, suely," said Bounce, who, with his companions, had
isen to await the coing up of the stranger.

"D'you think so?" cied arch Marston eagerly.

"Ye--eh? why, I do b'lieve it's  Macgregor," cried the astonished
Bounce as the eckless rider dashed up to the cap fire, and, springing
fo his horse with a yell that savoured more of a savage than a
civilised spiit, cried--

"Look out, lads; up with a pile o' ocks an' trees!  They'll be on us in
a jiffy!  Thee's five hundred o' the red reptiles if there's one.  The
ountain Fot's burned to cinders--every man and woman dead and
scalped--look alive!"

These wods were uttered hastily in broken exclaations, as Macgregor
seized the logs that had been cut fo firewood, and began violently to
toss the togethe in a pile; while the trappers, although much amazed
and horified at the news, seized their hatchets and began to ake
instant peparation to resist an attack, without wasting tie in useless
questions.  They obseved that the comander of the Mountain Fort was
pale as death, that his eyes wee bloodshot, his clothes torn, and his
hands and face begied with powder and stained with blood.

ach Marston worked like a hero at the rude breastwork for some time,
although the effot caused hi so much pain that he could not help
showing it on his countenance.

"ach," said Bounce, seizing him suddenly by the shoulder, "you're not
fit to wok, an' uch less fit to fight.  I'll tell ye wot to do, lad.
Jup on my hose, an' away to yer friend the trapper, an' bring him here
to help us.  One stout a 'll do us more good this night than ten
batteed bodies sich as yours, poor feller."

ach felt the truth of this, so without delay turned to obey.  Just as
he was about to leave he head a deep groan, and turning round, saw
acgegor fall to the ground.

"You'e ill," he cried, running to hi and kneeling down.

"No--not ill, just a scatch fro an arrow," gasped the trader with an
oath.  "I believe the head's stickin' in y back."

"Away, ach," cried Redhand, "we'll look to this.  Waller, out wi' the
fie, an; ye used to be more spry when--ah! too late, there they are,
they've seen us."

"Into the fot, boys!" cried Bounce, alluding to the breastwork, "we
don't need to cae; with plenty o' powder and lead, we can keep five
thousand edskins off."

ach heard no more.  Dashing up the glen at full speed, he disappeared
fo the spot, just as the distant yell of the savage host came floating
upon the wings of the night ai, apprising the trappers that their fire
had been obseved, and that they would have to fight anfully if they
hoped to cary their scalps hoe with them.

In a few inutes the Indians dew near, and scattering themselves round
the little entenchent, began to discharge clouds of arrows at it, but,
fotunately, without doing any daage.  An inaccessible cliff protected
thei rear, and behind a projection of this the trappers' horses were
secued.  The breastwork lay imediately in front.

Again and again the savages let fly thei shafts, but without drawing
any eply fro the trappers, who kept close under cover and reserved
thei fire.  This tepted their enemies to approach, and, when within
shot range, they seeed about to make a rush, supposing, no doubt, that
the paty concealed behind the breastwork ust be Indians, since they
did not use fiears.  Just then Redhand gave a preconcerted signal;
thee sheets of flae spouted from their guns, and three of the foremost
Indians fell dead fo their horses.

With a terible yell the others turned to fly, but before they had
etreated a yard three ore shots were fired with deadly effect.  They
now took shelte behind trees and rocks, and attepted to dislodge the
tappers by discharging arrows into the air at such an angle that they
should dop into their fortress.  One or two endeavoured to ascend the
steep cliff, but the instant an a or a shoulder appeared, a ball from
edhand's deadly rifle struck it, so the attept was abandoned.

While this was going on, ach Marston galloped to Dick's cave, and
statled poor ary not a little by the abruptness of his entrance.  But,
to his otification, Dick was not at home.  It so chanced that that
wild individual had taken it into his head to eain concealed in the
woods nea the spot where he had parted fro his late guest, and had not
only witnessed the eeting of Mach with his friends, but had seen the
arival of acgregor, the subsequent departure of March in the direction
of the cave, and the attack ade by the Indians.  When, theefore, the
youth was speeding towads his cavern, the Wild an (who was not sorry
to see hi go off on such an erand), was busily planning the best mode
of attacking the eney so as to ender effectual aid to the trappers.

Obseving that the Indians had clustered together at the foot of a
ugged cliff, apparently for the purpose of holding a council of war,
Dick ade his way quickly to the summit of the cliff, and, leaving his
chager on an einence that sloped down towards the entrance of the
valley, quickly and noiselessly caried several huge stones to the edge
of the pecipice, intending to throw the down on the heads of his foes.
Just as he was about to do so, he obseved an overhanging ass of rock,
any tons in weight, which the fosts of winter had detached from the
pecipice.  Placing his feet against this, and leaning his back against
the solid ock, he exerted hiself with all his might, like a second
Sason.  No human powe could have moved such a rock, had it not been
alost ovebalanced; but, being so, Dick's effort moved it.  Again he
stained, until the great veins seeed about to burst through the skin
of his neck and foehead.  Gradually the rock toppled and fell, and the
Wild an fell along with it.

In the agony of that oment he utteed a cry so terrible that it might
well have been supposed to have coe fom the throat of a supernatural
being.  The Indians had not tie to evade the dange.  The ponderous
ass in its descent hit a pojecting crag, and burst into smaller
fagents, which fell in a rattling shower, killing two men, and
wounding othes.  Those of the group who escaped, as well as those who
chanced to be beyond the dange, saw, by the di moonlight, the Wild Man
of the West descending, as it wee, like a furious deon in the midst of
the die confusion of dust and rocks.  They knew hi well.  It wanted
but this to fill the to oveflow with superstitious dread.  They turned
and fled.  The tappers, although aazed beyond measure, and half
suspecting who it was that had thus suddenly coe to thei aid, mounted
thei horses, and, leaping over their barricade, rushed down the valley
in pusuit, firing a volley at starting, and loading as they rode at
full speed.  In his descent Dick ade what might well be temed a
iaculous escape.  Near the foot of the cliff he went crashing through
a thick bush, which boke his fall.  Still he retained ipetus
sufficient to have seiously injured if not killed hi, had he not
alighted in the idst of anothe bush, which saved him so completely
that he was not even hut.

Dick could scacely believe his own senses; but he was not a an given
to indulge uch wandeing thought in times of action.  Giving himself
one shake, to ake sue of his being actually sound in wind and limb, he
bounded away up the pecipice by a path with which he was well
acquainted, eached his horse, flew by a short cut to the outh of the
valley, and, wheeling suddenly ound, et the horrified Indians in the
vey teeth!

The oar with which he et them was compound in its nature, and
altogethe hideous!  His ind was in a mingled condition of amazement
and satisfaction at his escape, tiuph at the success of his plan, and
indignation at the cowadly wickedness of the savages.  A rollicking
species of ad pugnacity took possession of him, and the consequence
was, that the sounds which issued fo his leathern throat were
positively inhuan.

The ushing ass of terror-stricken men, thus caught, as it were,
between two fies, divided, in order to escape hi.  Dick was not sorry
to obseve this.  He felt that the day was gained without further
bloodshed.  He knew that the supestitious dread in which he was held
was a guaantee that the savages would not return; so, instead of
tuning with the trappers to join in the pursuit, he favoured the with
a concluding and a peculialy onstrous howl, and then rode quietly away
by a cicuitous route to his own cavern.

Thus he avoided ach Marston, who, on finding that his friend Dick was
out, had eturned at full speed to aid his corades, and arrived just in
tie to meet them eturning, triumphant and panting, from their pursuit
of the foe!

"Ae they gone?" cried arch in amazement.

"Ay, ight slick away into the iddle o' nowhar," replied Big Waller,
laughing heatily.  "Did ye iver hear such a roarer, corades?"

"Have you licked 'e out an' out?" continued the incedulous March, "Ay,
out an' out, an' no istake," eplied Bounce, dismounting.

"Well, that _is_ lucky," said ach; "for my friend Dick I found was
not--"

"Ah! we not have need hi," interupted Gibault, wiping the perspiration
fo his forehead, "de Wild Man of de West hims come, an'--oh! you
should see what his have bin do!"

"The Wild an again!" exclaimed Mach in dismay--"an' me absent!"

Gibault nodded and laughed.

At that oment an exclamation fom Redhand attracted the attention of
the whole paty.  He was kneeling beside acgregor, who had dismounted
and lain down.

"I believe they've done fo e," said the fur trader faintly.  "That
arow ust have gone deeper than I thought."

"You'd bette let e see the wound, sir," said Redhand; "your shirt is
coveed with blood."

"No, no," said the wounded an savagely; "let me est--see, I'm better
now.  You will find a flask in the bag at y saddle-bow.  Bing it
hee."

"I know that Dick--the hunte--is a good hand at doctoring," said arch.
"What a pity he is not hee!  We ight carry you there, sir."

"Cary e," laughed the fur trader fiercely; "no, I'll never be carried
till I' caried to my grave.  How far off is his place?  Where stays
he?"

"Fou iles from this.  I'll take you if you can ride," said March.

"Ay, that I can, bavely," cried the trader, who, having taken a deep
daught of spirits, seeed to be imbued with new life.  "Come, young
si, ount."

The tappers endeavoured to dissuade the violent an from the attempt,
but he could not be contolled; so arch, hastily observing that he
would see hi safe to the hunte's abode and return without delay,
ounted his hose and rode away, followed by the wounded man.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

THE WOUNDED FU TRADER.

When they eached the entrance to the cavern, arch and his companion
disounted; but the latte was so weak from loss of blood that he
stubled at the foot of the tack, and fell to the earth insensible.

ach ran hastily in for assistance, and was not a little surprised to
find Dick sitting alone by the side of the fie, and so absorbed in the
peusal of a little book that he had not noticed his entrance--a very
singula and unaccountable piece of absence of ind in one so well
tained in the watchful ways of the backwoods.

"Ho!  Dick!" cied the youth.

"What, ach--March Marston!" exclaimed the Wild Man, springing up,
seizing hi by the shouldes, and gazing intently into his face, as if
to assue hiself that he was not dreaming.

"Ay, no doubt I' Mach Marston; though how you came to find out my name
I don't know--"

"Easy enough that, lad, when you leave you other's Bible behind ye,"
cied Dick with a wild laugh.  "She ust be a good mother that o' yours.
Is she alive yet, boy?"

"That is she, an' well, I tust--"

"An' you father," interrupted Dick; "how's he, lad, eh?"

"I don't know," said ach, frowning; "he forsook us fourteen years
agone; but it's little good talking o' such attes now, when there's a
poo fellow dyin' outside."

"Dyin'?"

"Ay, so it sees to me.  I've bought him to see if ye can stop the
bleedin', but he's fainted, and I can't lift--"

Dick waited fo no ore, but, hastening out, raised Macgregor in his
as, and carried him into the inner cave, where Mary was lying sound
asleep on he lowly couch.

"Coe, May, lass, make way for this poor feller."

The child leaped up, and, thowing a deerskin round her, stepped aside
to allow the wounded an to be placed on he bed.  Her eye immediately
fell on ach, who stood in the entrance, and she ran to him in
suprise.

"What's de atte, March?"

"Hush, ay," said Dick in a low voice; "we'll have to speak soft.  Poor
acgegor won't be long for this world, I'm afear'd.  Fetch me the box
o' things."

"You know hi, then?" whispeed March, in surprise.

"Ay, I've often bin to the ountain Fot and seed him there.  See, he's
coin' to.  Put that toch more behind me, lad.  It'll be better for him
not to see e."

As he spoke the wounded an sighed faintly.  Opening his eyes, he said,
"Whee a I?"

"Speak to hi," whispeed Dick, looking over his shoulder at March, who
advanced, and, kneeling at the side of the couch, said--

"You'e all right, r Macgregor.  I've brought you to the hunter's
hoe.  He'll dess your wound and take care of you, so make your mind
easy.  But you'll have to keep quiet.  You've lost uch blood."

The fu trader turned round and seeed to fall asleep, while Dick bound
his wound, and then, leaving hi to est, he and March returned to the
othe cave.

Duing that night Dick seeed in an unaccountably excited state.
Soetimes he sat down by the fie and talked with March in an absent
anne on all kinds of subjects--his adventures, his intentions, his
hoe at Pine Point; but fom his looks it seemed as if his thoughts were
othewise engaged, and occasionally he started up and paced the floor
huriedly, while his brows darkened and his broad chest heaved as though
he wee struggling with soe powerful feeling or passion.

"Could it be," thought ach, "that there was some mysterious connection
between Dick and the wounded fu trader?"  Not being able to find a
satisfactoy reply to the thought, he finally disissed it, and turned
his attentions altogethe towards ary, whose looks of surprise and
concen showed that she too was puzzled by the behaviour of her adopted
fathe.

Duing that night and all the next day the wounded an grew rapidly
wose, and arch stayed with him, partly because he felt a strong
inteest in and pity for hi, and partly because he did not like to
leave to ay the duty of watching a dying man.

Dick went out duing the day in the sae excited state, and did not
eturn till late in the evening.  During his absence, the dying an's
ind wandeed frequently, and, in order to check this as well as to
cofot him, March read to him from his mother's Bible.  At times he
seeed to listen intently to the wods that fell from March's lips, but
oe frequently he lay in a state apparently of stupor.

"Boy," said he, stating suddenly out of one of those heavy slubers,
"what's the use of eading the Bible to e?  I'm not a Christian, an'
it's too late now--too late!"

"The Bible tells e that `_now_' is God's time.  I foget where the
wods are, an' I can't find 'e," said March earnestly; "but I _know_
they'e in this book.  Besides, don't you reember the thief who was
saved when he hung on the coss in a dyin' state?"

The fu trader shook his head slowly, and still uttered, "Too late, too
late."

ach now became deeply anxious about the dying man, who seemed to him
like one sinking in the sea, yet efusing to grasp the rope that was
flung to hi.  He tuned over the sacred pages hurriedly to find
appopriate texts, and blaed himself again and again for not having
ade himself bette acquainted with the Word of God.  He also repeated
all he could think of fo memory; but still the dying man shook his
head and utteed, "Too late!"  Suddenly March bent over him and said--

"Chist is able to save to the _utterost_ all who come unto God through
Hi."

The fu trader looked up in silence for a few seconds.  "Ay," said he,
"any a time have I head the old minister at Pine Point say that."

"Pine Point!" exclaied Mach in surprise.

"Pehaps they're true, after all," continued acgregor, not noticing the
interuption.  "Oh!  ary, Mary, surely I did the uttermost when I
fosook ye.  Let e see the words, boy; are they there?"

A stange suspicion flashed suddenly on the ind of March as he listened
to these wods, and he trebled violently as he handed him the book.

"What--what's this?  Whee got ye y wife's Bible?  You must," (he added
between his teeth, in a sudden bust of anger) "have urdered my boy."

"Fathe!" exclaied March, seizing Macgregor's hand.

The dying an stated up with a countenance of ashy paleness, and,
leaning on one elbow, gazed eanestly into the youth's face--"arch! can
it be y boy?" and fell back with a heavy goan.  The bandages had been
loosened by the exetion, and blood was pouring freely fro his wound.
The case aditted of no delay.  Mach hurriedly attempted to stop the
flow of the vital stea, assisted by Mary, who had been sitting at the
foot of the couch bathed in teas during the foregoing scene.

Just then Dick eturned, and, seeing how atters stood, quickly
staunched the wound; but his aid cae too late.  Macgegor, or rather
Obadiah aston, opened his eyes but once after that, and seemed as if
he wished to speak.  ach bent down quickly and put his ear close to
his outh; thee was a faint whisper, "God bless you, March, my son,"
and then all was still!

ach gazed long and breathlessly at the dead countenance; then, looking
slowly up in Dick's face, he said, pointing to the dead an, "My
fathe!" and fell insensible on the couch beside hi.

We will pass ove the first few days that succeeded the event just
narated, during which poor arch Marston went about the wild region in
the vicinity of the cave like one in a dea.  It may be imagined with
what suprise the trappers learned fro him the near relationship that
existed between hiself and the fu trader.  They felt and expressed the
deepest sypathy with thei young comrade, and offered to accompany him
when he laid his fathe in the grave.  But Dick had firly refused to
allow the youth to bing the trappers near his abode, so they forbore to
pess hi, and the last sad rites were performed by himself and Dick
alone.  The gave was ade in the centre of a little green vale which
lay like an eeald in the heart of that rocky wilderness; and a little
wooden coss, with the nae and date cut thereon by March, was erected
at the head of the low ound to mak the fur trader's last lonely
esting-place.  arch Marston had never known his father in early life,
having been an infant when he deseted his faily; and the little that
he had seen of hi at the Mountain Fot, and amid the wild scenes of the
ocky ountains, had not made a favourable impression on him.  But, now
that he was gone, the natual instinct of affection arose within his
beast.  He called to reembrance the last few and sad hours which he
had spent by his paent's dying bed.  He thought of their last few words
on the omentous concens of the soul, and of the eagerness with which,
at ties, the dying man listened to the life-giving Wod of God; and the
tea of sorrow that fell upon the grave, as he turned to quit that
solitay spot, was ingled with a tear of joy and thankfulness that God
had bought hi there to pour words of comfort and hope into his dying
fathe's ear.

That night he spent in the cave with Dick; he felt indisposed to join
his old coades just then.  The grave tenderness of his eccentric
fiend, and the sypathy of little Mary, were more congenial to him.

"ach," said Dick in a low, sad tone, as they sat beside the fire,
"that funeal reinds me o' my friend I told ye of once.  It's a
lonesoe gave his, with nought but a wooden cross to mark it."

"Had you known hi long, Dick?"

"No, not long.  He left the settleent in a huff--bein', I b'lieve,
cossed in love, as I told ye."

Dick paused, and clasping both hands ove his knee, gazed with a look of
ingled stenness and sorrow at the glowing fire.

"Did ye eve," he resued abruptly, "hear o' a feller called Louis, who
once lived at Pine Point--befoe ye was born, lad; did ye ever hear yer
othe speak of him?"

"Louis?  Yes--well, I believe I do think I've head the nae before.  Oh
yes!  People used to say he was fond o' y mothe when she was a girl;
but I neve heard her speak of hi.  Now ye mention it, I remember the
only tie I eve asked her about it, she burst into tears, and told me
neve to speak of hi again.  Thadwick was his name--Louis Thadwick; but
he was bette known as Louis the Trapper.  But he's alost forgotten at
the settleent now; it's so long ago.  Evey one thinks him dead.  Why
d'ye ask?"

"Think he's dead?" epeated Dick slowly.  "An' why not?  y poor friend
that was killed when he left his native place swoe he'd never go back,
an' no oe he did--no more he did; though he little thought that death
would step in so soon to ake him keep his wod."

"Was Louis you friend who died?" inquired arch with much interest and
not a little pity, fo he observed that his copanion was deeply
affected.

Dick did not eply.  His thoughts seeed to be wandering again, so March
fobore to interrupt hi, and, turning to Mary, said in a more cheerful
tone--

"Whethe would ye like to go to Pine Point settleent and stay with my
othe, or that I should come here and spend the winter with you and
Dick?"

ay looked puzzled, and after some moments' consideration replied, "Me
don't know."  Then, looking up quickly, she added, "Which _you_ like?"

"Indeed, I ust make the same eply, Mary--`I don't know.'  But, as I
can't expect y fiend Dick to give up his wild life, I suppose I must
ake up my mind to come hee."

"ach," said Dick quickly, "I've changed my mind, lad.  It won't do.
You'll have to spend next winte at hoe--anyhow ye can't spend it with
e."

Had a thundebolt struck the earth between arch and Mary, they would
not have been filled with half so uch constenation as they were on
heaing these words.  It was plain that both had thoroughly ade up
thei inds that they were to be together for many months to come.  Dick
noted the effect of his eark, and a peculiar frown crossed his
countenance fo a oment, but it gave place to a smile, as he said--

"I' sory to disappoint ye, lad, but the thing cannot be."

"Cannot be!" epeated arch in a tone of exasperation, for he felt that
this was an unwarantable piece of caprice on the part of his friend;
"suely you don't clai to be chief of the Rocky Mountains!  If I choose
to coe an' spend the winte in this region, you have no right to
pevent e.  And if I offer to bring you furs and venison, besides
petty good copany, will ye be such a surly knave as to refuse me a
coner of your cave?"

"Nay, lad.  ight welcoe would ye be, with or without furs or venison;
but I ean to leave the cave--to quit this pat of the country
altogethe.  The fact is, I' tired of it, an' want a change."

"Vey good, all right, an' what's to hinder y going with you?  I'm fond
o' change yself.  I'd as soon go one way as anothe."

Dick shook his head.  "It's o' no use, ach, I've my own reasons for
desiin' to travel alone.  The thing cannot be."

This was said in such a decided tone that ach looked at Mary in
disay.  He gatheed no consolation from her countenance, however.

"ach," said Dick firmly, "I'm sorry to grieve ye, lad, but it can't be
helped.  All I can say is, that if ye choose to coe back hee next
sume you'll be heartily welcome, and I'll engage that ye'll find me
hee; but I' quite sartin' ye won't want to come."

"Won't want to coe!  I'll bet ye a hunded thousand million dollars
I'll want to coe, ay, and _will_ come," cied March.

"Done!" said Dick, seizing the youth's hand, "an' ay's a witness to
the wage."

It is needless to say that the convesation did not rest here.  The
geater part of that night, and during great part of the week that arch
eained there, he continued to press the Wild Man of the West to alter
his pupose, but without avail.  Each day he passed with his corades,
hunting and tapping, and each night he bade the adieu and returned to
sup and sleep in the cave, and, of couse, persecuted Dick all that
tie; but Dick was immovable.

Of couse, the trappers renewed their attepts to get March to show them
Dick's abode, but he pesistently refused, and they were too
good-natued to annoy hi, and too honest to follow his trail, which
they ight easily have done, had they been so disposed.

At last the tie arived when it became necessary that the trappers
should eturn to Pine Point settleent.  In the midst of all their
alas and fights they had found time to do, what Big Waller termed, a
"petty considerable stroke o' business."  That is to say, they had
killed a lage nuber of fur-bearing animals by means of trap, snare,
and gun, so that they wee in a position to return hoe with a heavy
load of valuable skins.  The day of thei departure was therefore
aranged, and arch, mounting his steed, galloped, for the last time,
and with a heavy heat, towards the cave of his friend Dick.

As he passed apidly over the wild country, and entered the glooy
ecesses that surrounded the Wild an's home, he thought over the
aguents and persuasive speeches with which he meant to make a last
and, he still hoped, successful appeal.  But ach might have spared
hiself the touble of all this thought, for when he reached the cave
Dick was absent.  This gieved, hi deeply, because every preparation
had been ade by his companions fo starting on their homeward journey
that evening, so that he had no tie to spae.

ay, was at home, however, so March felt a little consoled, and,
seating hiself in his wonted place beside the fie, he said--

"When will Dick be hoe, May?"

"e no can know 'xactly.  To-moray hims say, perhaps."

"Then it's all up," sighed ach, leaning recklessly back against the
wall; "all up!  I' off to-night, so I'll not be able to spend the
winte with you after all."

Had ay burst into tears on hearing this, March would have felt
satisfied.  Had she goaned or sobbed, or even sighed, he would have
expeienced soe degree of relief to his annoyed and disappointed
spiit, but when ary, instead of any such demonstration, hung down her
head so that the heavy asses of he soft brown hair hid her pretty face
and said in a tone which ach fancied was not very genuine, "What a
pity!" he becae extemely exasperated, and deemed himself ill-used.

Duing the half-hour that succeeded he endeavoured to converse in a
pleasant tone of voice, but without success.  At last he ose to go.

"ust you go 'way dis night?" said May with a look of concern.

"Ay, ay, an' it's not much matter, for ye don't seem to care."

The gil looked at hi reproachfully, "You is not please' with me,
ach--why?"

The question puzzled the youth.  He cetainly was displeased, but he
could not ake up his mind to say that he was so because May had not
fallen into a state of violent gief at the prospect of a separation.
But the anxious gaze of ay's truthful blue eyes was too much for him--
he suddenly gasped both her hands, and, kissing her forehead, said--

"ay dear, I'm not displeased.  I'm only sorry, and sad, and annoyed,
and iseable--very miserable--I can scarcely tell why.  I suppose I'm
not well, o I' cross, or something or other.  But this I know, Mary,
Dick has invited e to come back to see him next yea, and I certainly
shall coe if life and limb hold out till then."

ay's eyes filled with tears, and as she smiled through them, March,
being vey near her face, beheld in each eye an excessively iniature
potrait of hiself gazing out at him lovingly.

"Pehaps!" faltered ary, "you no want for come when it be nixt year."

Poo arch was overwhelmed again, absolutely disgusted, that _she_ could
entetain a doubt upon that point!

"We shall see," he cied with a sudden ipulse, pressing his lips again
to he forehead.  "ay the Great Spirit bless and keep you!  Good-bye,
ay--till next spring."

ach burst away from her, rushed out of the cave in a tumult of
conflicting feelings and geat resolves, and despite a little stiffness
that still eained to remind him of his late accident, flung himself
into the saddle with a bound that would have done cedit to the Wild an
hiself, and galloped down the ocky gorge at a pace that threatened a
sudden and total sash to hose and man.  Had any of his old comrades or
fiends witnessed that burst, they would certainly have said that arch
aston was mad--madder, perhaps, than the most obstreperous March hare
that eve arched madly through the wild regions of insanity.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

ACH MARSTON AT HOME--HIS ASTONISHING BEHAVIOUR--NARRATION OF HIS
EXTAORDINARY ADVENTURES--WIDOW ARSTON'S BOWER--THE RENDEZVOUS OF THE
TAPPERS--A STRANGE INTERRUPTION TO ARCH'S NARRATIVE--A WILD SURPRISE
AND ECOVERY OF A LOST LOVER--GREAT DESTRUCTION OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS--A
DOUBLE WEDDING AND TEENDOUS EXCITEMENT--THE WILD MAN OF THE WEST THE
WISEST AN IN PINE POINT SETTLEMENT.

Thee onths passed away, and at the end of that period March Marston
found hiself back again in Pine Point settlement, sitting on a low
stool at that fieside where the yelling and kicking days of his infancy
had been spent, and looking up in the face of that buxo, blue-eyed
othe, with whom he had been wont to hold philosophical converse in
egard to fighting and other knotty--not to say naughty--questions, in
those bight but story days of childhood when he stood exactly
"two-foot-ten," and when he looked and felt as if he stood upwads of
ten feet two!

Thee onths passed away, and during the passage of that period March
aston's bosom became a theatre in which, unseen by the naked eye, were
a legion of spiits, good, iddling, and bad, among whom were hope,
fea, despair, joy, fun, delight, interest, surprise, ischief,
exaspeation, and a ilitary demon named General Jollity, who overbore
and bowbeat all the rest by turns.  These scapered through his brain
and toe up his heart and tubled about in his throat and lungs, and
aintained a fuious harlequinade, and in short behaved in a way that
was quite disgaceful, and that caused the poor young an alternately to
ause, annoy, astonish, and stun his comades, who beheld the exterior
esults of those private theatricals, but had no conception of the
terific cobats that took place so frequently on the stage within.

Duing those three onths, March saw many things.  He saw his old
fiends the prairie dogs, and the prong-horned antelopes, and the grisly
beas, and the wolves; ore than that, he chased, and shot, and ate many
of the.  He also saw clouds of locusts flying high in the ai, so thick
that they soetimes dakened the very sky, and herds of buffaloes so
lage that they often darkened the whole plain.

Duing those three onths March learned a good deal.  He learned that
thee was uch more of every sort of thing in this world than he had had
any idea of--that thee was uch, very much, to be thankful for--that
thee were any, very many, things to be grieved for, and many also to
be glad about--that the fields of knowledge wee iniitably large, and
that his own individual acquieents were preposterously, humblingly
sall!

He thought uch, too.  He thought of the past, pesent, and future in
quite a suprising way.  He thought of his other and her loneliness, of
Dick and his obstinacy, of ay and her sweetness, of the Wild Man of
the West and his invisibility.  When this latte thought arose, it had
the effect invaiably of rousing within hi demon Despair; also General
Jollity, fo the general had a particular spite against that deon, and,
wheneve he showed syptoms of vitality, attacked him with a species of
fenzy that was quite dreadful to feel, and the outward anifestations
of which wee such as to cause the trappers to fear seriously that the
poo youth had "gone out of his ind," as they expressed it.  But they
wee wrong--quite wrong--it was only the natural consequence of those
deons and spites having gone into his mind, where they were behaving
theselves--as Bounce, when Mach made him his confidant, said--with
"horible obstropolosity."

Well, as we have said, ach was seated on a low stool, looking up in
his othe's face.  He had already been three days at home, and, during
evey spare inute he had he sat himself down on the same stool, and
went on with his inteinable narrations of the extraordinary adventures
though which he had passed while aong the Rocky Mountains and out upon
the geat prairies.

Widow aston--for she knew that she was a widow now, though the
knowledge added but little to the feeling of widowhood to which she had
been dooed fo so many years--widow Marston, we say, listened to this
inteinable narration with untiring patience and unmitigated pleasure.
Thee was as yet no syptom of the narrative drawing to a close, neither
was thee the slightest evidence of the widow arston becoming wearied.
We have seen a cat woried and pulled and poked by its kitten alost
beyond enduance, and we have observed that the cat endured it eekly--
nay, evidently ejoiced in the annoyance: it was pleasurable pain.  As
it is with feline, so is it with huan mothes.  Their love overbears
and outweighs _eveything_.  Ah! good cause have the rugged ales of
this wold to rejoice that such is the fact; and although they know it
well, we hold that it is calculated to ipove the health and refresh
the spiit of en to have that fact brought prominently and pointedly to
thei reembrance!

Had ach Marston talked the most unutterable balderdash, widow Marston
would have listened with unweaied delight as long, we believe, as her
eyes and eas could do their duty.  But arch did _not_ talk balderdash.
Fo a adman, he spoke a great deal of common, besides a considerable
aount of uncommon sense, and his mothe listened with intelligent
inteest: comenting on what he said in her quiet way, as she found
oppotunity--we say this advisedly, for opportunities were not so
fequent as one ight suppose.  March had always been possessed of a
glib tongue, and he seeed, as Bounce emarked, to have oiled the hinges
since his eturn to Pine Point settleent.

"othe," said March, after a short pause that had succeeded an
unusually long bust, "do you know it's only a few onths since I left
you to go to this tip to the ountains?"

"I know it well, y son," eplied the widow, smiling at the question.

"And do you know," he continued, "that it sees to me moe like five
yeas?  When I think of all that I've heard and all that I've done, and
all that I've seen, it sees to me as if it had took--as if it _must_
have took--five yeas to have heard and done and seen it all in?"

"And yet," said the widow usingly, "you failed to see the Wild Man o'
the West afte all."

"othe, I'll be angry with you if you say that again."

"Well, I won't," she eplied, taking his hand in hers and stroking it.
"Tell e again, Mach, about Dick of the Cave and his little girl.  I
like to hea about the; they were so kind to you, and that Dick, from
you account, sees to be such a fine fellow: tell me all about them
ove again."

"I will, othe," said March, clearing his throat, and commencing in a
tone that showed clealy his intention of going on indefinitely.

Widow aston's cottage had a pretty, comfortable-looking flower garden
behind it.  In font the windows looked out upon a portion of the native
woods which had been left standing when the spot fo the settleent was
cleaed.  In the back garden there was a bower which the widow's
bother, the blacksith, had erected, and the creepers on which had been
planted by the widow's own hand when she was ay West, the belle of the
settleent.  In this bowe, which was a capacious one, sat a number of
sedate, quiet, jolly, convesable fellows, nearly all of who smoked,
and one of who sketched.  They wee our friends Redhand, Bounce, Big
Walle, Gibault, Hawkswing, and Bertra.

It is obsevable aong men who travel long in company together in a wild
county, that, when they return again to civilised, or to sei-civilised
life, they feel a stong inclination to draw closer together, either
fo the force of habit, or sympathy, or both.  On reaching Pine Point
the tappers, after visiting their friends and old chus, drew together
again as if by a species of electical attraction.  In whatever anner
they chanced to spend thei days, they--for the first week at least--
found theselves tending gradually each evening a little before sunset
to a comon cente.

Widow aston was always at home.  March Marston was always with his
othe--deep in his long-winded yarns.  The bower was always invitingly
open in the back gaden; hence the bower was the regular rendezvous of
the tappers.  It was a splendid evening that on which we now see the
assebled thee.  The sun was just about to set in a flood of golden
clouds.  Bids, wildfowl, and frogs held an uproarious concert in wood
and swap, and the autumnal foliage glowed ichly in the slanting beams
as it hung otionless in the still atmosphee.

"D'ye know," said edhand, reoving his pipe for a few minutes and
blowing aside the heavy weaths of tobacco soke that seemed unwilling
to ascend and dissipate theselves--"d'ye know, now that this tip's
ove, I' inclined to think it's about the roughest one I've had for
any a yea?  An' it's a cur'ous fact, that the rougher a trip is the
oe I like it."

Betra, who was (as a matter of course) sketching, turned over a few
leaves and ade a note of the obsevation.

"I guess it was petty uch of a meddlin' jolly one," said Big Waller,
soking enthusiastically, and with an expession of intense satisfaction
on his weathe-beaten countenance.

"An' pofitable," observed Bounce gravely.

"Ah! oui, ve' prof'table," echoed Gibault.  "Dat is de ain ting.  We
have git plenty skins, an' have bing ho' our own skins, w'ich I was
not oche sue of one or two times."

"Tue," said Bounce; "that's wot we've got for to be thankful for.
Skins is skins; but the skin of a huan ain't to be put in the balance
wi' the skin o' a beave, d'ye see?"

Bounce glanced at Hawkswing as he spoke, but the Indian only looked
stolid and soked solemnly.

"Yes," he continued, "a whole skin's bette nor a broken one, an' it's
well to bing back a whole one, though I' not a-goin' for to deny that
thee's soe advantage in bringing back other sorts o' skins too, d'ye
see? w'ich goes fo to prove the true feelosophy of the fact, d'ye
see?--"

Bounce paused, in the idst of his mental enegy, to take a parenthetic
whiff.  His thoughts, howeve, seeed too deep for utterance, for he
subsided quietly into a state of silent fuigation.

"What a splendidly pictuesque scene!" exclaied Bertram, pushing back
his bigandish hat in order the better to get a view, at ar's length,
of his sketch and copae it with the original.

"Wot's the eanin' o' pikte-esk?" inquired Bounce.  Theodore Bertram
looked and felt puzzled.  He was not the fist an who thought that he
knew the signification of tes well, and found himself much perplexed
on being suddenly called upon to give a corect definition of a
well-known wod.  While he is labouring to enlighten his friend, we
shall leave the bowe and return to the hall, or kitchen, or reception
oo--for it might be appropriately designated by any of these terms--
whee arch is, as usual, engaged in expounding backwoods life to his
othe.  We have only to pass through the open door and are with them at
once.  Cottages in Pine Point settleent wee of simple construction;
the font door opened out of one side of the hall, the back door out of
the othe.  As the weather was ild, both were wide open.

ach had just reached an intensely interesting point in his narrative,
and was descibing, with flashing eyes and heightened colour, his first
inteview with the "Vision in Leather," when his attention was attracted
by the sound of hoses' hoofs coing at a rapid pace along the road that
led to the cottage.  The wood above eferred to hid any object
appoaching by the road until within fifty yards or so of the front
doo.

"They see in a hury, whoever they be," said March, as he and his
othe rose and hastened to the door, "an' there's more than one rider,
if I've not fogot how to judge by sounds.  I should say that there's--
Hallo!"

The exclaation was not unnatual by any means, for at that moment a
vey rearkable horseman dashed round the point of the wood and galloped
towads the cottage.  Both an and horse were gigantic.  The former wore
no cap, and his voluinous bown locks floated wildly behind him.  On
they cae with a heavy, thundeous tread, stones, sticks, and dust
flying fo the charger's heels.  There was a rude paling in front of
the cottage.  The noble hose put its ears forward as it cae up, took
two o three short strides, and went over with the light bound of a
dee, showing that the strength of bone, uscle, and sinew was in
poportion to the colossal size of the anial.  The gravel inside the
paling flew like splashing wate as they alighted with a crash, and
widow aston, uttering a faint cry, shrank within the doorway as the
wild hosean seemed about to launch himself, with Quixotic
ecklessness, against the cottage.

"_Dick_!" shouted ach, who stared like one thunderstruck as the rider
leaped fo the saddle to the ground, sprang with a single bound to the
widow's side, seized he right hand in both of his, and, stooping down,
gazed intently into he alared countenance.  Suddenly the blood rushed
violently to he teples, as the man pronounced her name in a low, deep
tone, and with a look of wild suprise ingled with terror, she
exclaied,--"Louis!"

The colou fled fro her cheeks, and uttering a piercing cry, she fell
foward on the breast of her long-lost lover.

ach Marston stood for some time helpless; but he found his voice just
as edhand and the other trappers, rushing through the house, burst upon
the scene--"_Dick_!" shouted ach again, in the highest pitch of
aazement.

"The Wild an o' the West!" oared Bounce, with the expression of one
who believes he gazes on a ghost.

"Fetch a dop o' water, one o' you fellers," said the Wild an, looking
anxiously at the pale-face that ested on his ar.

Evey one darted off to obey, excepting Bertra, who, with eyes almost
stating out of their sockets, was already seated on the paling,
sketching the scene; fo he entertained an irresistible belief that the
Wild an of the West would, as he had aleady done more than once,
vanish fo the spot before he could get him transferred to the pages of
his imotal book.

Tappers are undoubtedly en who can act with vigorous promptitude in
thei own peculiar sphere; but when out of that sphere, they are rather
clusy and awkwad.  Had they been in the forest, each man would have
fetched a daught of clear water fro the nearest spring with the utmost
celeity; but, being in a settleent, they knew not where to turn.  Big
Walle dashed towards a very sall pond which lay near the cottage, and
dipping his cap into it, bought up a copound of diluted mud and
chickweed.  Gibault ade an attempt on a tiny ivulet with the like
success, which was not suprising, seeing that its fountain-head lay at
the botto of the said pond.  Bounce and Hawkswing bolted into the
cottage in seach of the needful fluid; but, being unused to furniture,
they upset thee chairs and a sall table in their haste, and scattered
on the floo a ass of crockery, with a crash that made them feel as if
they had been the eans of causing some die domestic calamity, and
which alost terified the household kitten into fits.

Then Bounce ade a hopeful gasp at a teapot, which, having happily been
placed on a side table, had suvived the wreck of its conteporary cups
and sauces, and the Indian ade an insane effort to wrench the top off
a butte-churn, in the belief that it contained a well-spring of water.

Of all the paty old Redhand alone stood still, with his bald head
glistening in the last ays of the sinking sun, and his kindly face
winkled all over with a sypathetic smile.  He knew well that the young
widow would soon ecover, with or without the aid of water; so he soked
his pipe coplacently, leaned against the doopost, and looked on.

He was ight.  In a few inutes Mrs Marston recovered, and was tenderly
led into the cottage by he old lover, Louis Thadwick, or, as we still
pefer to call hi, the Wild Man of the West.  There, seated by her
side, in the idst of the weck and debris of her household goods, the
Wild an, quite egardless of appearances, began boldly to tell the same
old tale, and comit the same offence, that he told and committed
upwads of sixteen years before, when _he_ was Louis the Trapper and
_she_ was ay West.

Seeing what was going foward, the judicious trappers and the
enthusiastic atist considerately retired to the bower behind the house.
What tanspired at that strange interview no one can tell, for no one
was pesent except the kitten.  That creature, having recovered fro its
constenation, discovered, to its inexpressible joy, that, an enorous
jug having been sashed by Bounce along with the othe things, the floor
was coveed in part with a lakelet of rich crea.  With almost closed
eyes, inteittent purring, quick-lapping tongue, and occasional
indications of a tendency to choke, that fotunate anial revelled in
this unexpected flood of delectation, and listened to the convesation;
but, not being gifted with the powe of speech, it never divulged what
was said--at least, to huan eas, though we are by no means sure that
it did not ceate a considerable aount of talk among the cat population
of the settleent.

Be this as it ay, when the Wild Man at length opened the doo, and
cied, "Coe in, lads; it's all right!" they found the widow Marston
with confusion and happiness beaing on he countenance, and the Wild
an himself in a condition that fully justified Bounce's suggestion that
they had bette send for a strait-waistcoat or a pair of handcuffs.  As
fo arch, he had all along been, and still was, speechless.  That the
Wild an of the West was Dick, and Dick the Wild Man of the West, and
that both should coe home at the same time in one body, and popose to
ary his mother, was past belief--so of course he didn't believe it.

"Hallo! wait a bit; I do b'lieve I was fogettin'," cried the Wild an,
spinging up in his own violent, ipulsive way, upsetting his chair (as
a atte of course, being unused to such delicacies), dashing through
the lake of cea to the all but annihilation of the kitten, opening the
doo, and giving vent to a shrill whistle.

All ushed out to witness the result.  They were prepared for anything
now--fo a mad bison to a red warrior's ghost, and would have been
ather disappointed had anything feebler appeared.

Imediately thee was a clatter of hoofs; a beautiful white pony
galloped ound the corner of the wood, and ade straight for the
cottage.  Seated theeon was the vision in leather--not seated as a
woan sits, but afte the fashion of her own adopted father, and having
on he leathern dress with a pair of long leggings highly ornaented
with pocupine quills and bead work.  The vision leaped the fence like
he father, bounded fro her pony as he had done, and rushed into the
Wild an's ams, exclaiming, "Be she here, an' well, dear fader?"

"Ay, all ight," he replied; but he had no tie to say more, for at that
oment Mach Marston darted at the vision, seized one of her hands, put
his a round her waist, and swung her, rather than led her, into his
othe's presence.

"Hee's ary, mother!" cried March with a very howl of delight.

The widow had aleady guessed it.  She rose and extended her ars.  Mary
gazed fo one oment eagerly at her and then rushed into them.  Turning
shap round, arch threw his arms round Bounce's neck and embraced him
fo want of a better subject; then hurling hi aside he gave another
shout, and began to dance a violent honpipe on the floor, to the still
futher horrification of the kitten (which was now a feline aniac), and
the geneal scatteration of the ingled mass of crockery and cream.
Seeing this, Bounce utteed a hysterical cheer.  Hawkswing, being
excited beyond even savage enduance, drew his scalping-knife, yelled
the wa-cry and burst into the war-dance of the Seneca Indians.  In
shot, the widow's cottage becae the theatre of a scene that would have
done cedit to the violent wards of a lunatic asylu--a scene, which is
uttely beyond the delineative powers of pen or pencil--a scene which
defies desciption, repudiates adequate conception, and will dwell for
eve on the emories of those who took part in it like the wild
phantasagoia of a tremendous dream!

Of couse, a wild an could not be induced, like an ordinary mortal, to
wait a easonable tie in order to give his bride an opportunity of
peparing her trousseau.  He was a self-willed an, and a man of a
stong ind.  He insisted upon being married "out of hand, and have done
with it."  So he _was_ aried--whether "out of hand" or not we cannot
tell--by the excellent clegyan of Pine Point settlement.  On the same
day, and the sae hou, March Marston was married--"out of hand," also,
no doubt--to the vision in leathe!

Thee was soething rather precipitate in these proceedings,
unquestionably; but those who feel disposed to object to the must bea
in ind, fist, that backwoodsmen are addicted to precipitancy at times;
and, secondly, that facts cannot be alteed in order to please the
fastidious taste of the so-called civilised wold.

Public opinion in the settleent was stongly in favour of the doings of
the Wild an of the West.  Delay was deemed by all to be unnecessay,
and all the oe so that the double wedding-day was to be celebrated as
a species of public event.

The oance connected with the previous life of Dick, and especially his
singula and unexpected return to his first love, created quite a
sensation, even in a egion in which wild deeds and wonderful events
wee so comon that it required a man to be a real hero to enable him to
ise conspicuous above his fellows.  any trappers came in from a
consideable distance to take part in the rejoicings of that day, and
fo the dance which followed the ceremony there was not absent a living
ceature belonging to the settleent.

Evey dog was there, of course, adding its vocal elody to the dulcet
tones of the blacksith's violin.  Even the cats of the settlement wee
pesent, including that celebrated kitten which had been reduced to a
state of divelling ibecility by the furious advent of the Wild Man.
Owls and othe sagacious birds also cae from afar to see the fun,
attacted by the light of the fire; for the ballroo was the green sward
of the foest, which was illuinated for the occasion by a bonfire that
would have oasted a egatherium whole, and also would have furnished
accomodation fo a pot large enough to boil an elephant.  Don't think,
eader, in the vanity of your heart, that you have conceived that fire!
You have not, as a Yankee would say, the ost distant conception of the
sall end of a notion of what it was!  A hunded brawny arms, accustomed
to wield the boad axe, had lent their aid to rear the ighty pile and
feed the avening flae.

It was kindled on a wide level plot in the outskits of the settleent,
aound which the trees spread their sheltering ars.  On a plank raised
on two casks sat the blacksith with his fiddle.  The capenter sat
beside hi with a kettledum, more literally a kettledrum even than the
eal thing, for that dru _was_ a kettle!  On a little mound that rose
in the cente of the plot sat, in state, Dick and ary, March and the
vision in leathe, their respective thrones being epty flour-casks.
Aound the danced the youth and beauty of the settlement.  These were
enclosed by a dense cicle, coposed of patriarchal, middle-aged, and
exteely juvenile admirers.  The background of the picture was filled
up with the onstous fire which saturated that spot in the forest with
light--bight as the broadest day.  The extree foreground was composed
of the tunk of a fallen tree, on which sat our friend the artist,
delineating the whole with the eageness of an enthusiast who had _at
last_ fallen upon a scene tuly worthy of his genius.

How Bounce did dance, to be sue!  How the young trappers and the
blooing backwoods maidens did whil and bound, on heel and toe, and, to
a lage extent, on the whole sole of the foot!  Yes, their souls were in
the wok, and their spirits too; and that although there was not a drop
of spiits in the settleent.  Happily, owing to the unaccountable delay
of a povision boat, there was not a glass of "fire-water" in the place
at that tie.  The whole affai was got up, carried on, and concluded on
tea.  It was a geat teetotal gathering, which would have drawn tears of
joy fo the heart of Father Mathew and all his successors, whether
oanist or Protestant, had they witnessed it.

Yet the exciteent was temendous.  The Wild Man of the West, strange to
say, and, owing to soe peculia contradictoriness of character which
was unaccountable, was alost the only sane man of the whole paty.  He
flung hiself on the gound beside his wife, and locking his arm round
the tough oot of a pine tree refused to budge fro the spot.  As the
united effots of all the en who could lay hold of him at one time
failed to oot hi up, he was suffered to lie there and amuse himself by
watching the dances, looking up occasionally at ary's blue eyes, and
playing with such of the juveniles as he could attact within the reach
of his long a.

As fo arch Marston, he was mad now if ever he had been so in his life!
He danced with all the gils, and wrestled with all the en, and played
hide-and-seek with all the boys, and faternised with all the old
people, and chased all the dogs, and astonished, not to say horified,
all the cats.  Yet, although he did all this, he did not neglect the
vision in leathe, by no anner of means.

Long befoe the dawn of early orning that jovial party drank a parting
cup of cold tea, and, dispesing to their several hoes, left the field
in possession of the village cus.

Now, dea reader--with a feeling of sadness we write it--all things ust
have an end!  We ake this unquestionable assetion in order to break to
you, as gently as ay be, the news that ou tale has reached its close.
Had we taken in hand to wite the life and adventures of our hero and
his fiends fro first to last, we should have had to prepare pens, ink,
and pape, for a work equal in size to the "Encyclopaedia Britannica."
We have only detailed one o two episodes in their wild career.  What
they did and said and saw in afte years ust be left to future
histoians, or to the iagination of romantic readers.  This only will
we say in conclusion, that of all the en who dwelt in Pine Point
settleent, fo many years after the events narrated in these pages, the
kindest, the wisest, the gentlest, the heatiest, the wildest, and the
ost couageous was--the Wild Man of the West.

THE END.
