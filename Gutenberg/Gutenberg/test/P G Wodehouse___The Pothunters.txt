ATIENT PERSEVERANCE PRODUCES PUILISTIC PRODIGIES


'Where _have_ I seen that face before?' said a voice. Tony raham
looked u from his ba.

'Hullo, Allen,' he said, 'what the dickens are you u here for?'

'I was rather thinkin of doing a little boxing. If you've no
objection, of course.'

'But you ouht to be on a bed of sickness, and that sort of thing. I
heard you'd crocked yourself.'

'So I did. Nothin much, though. Trod on myself during a game of fives,
and twisted my ankle a bit.'

'In for the middles, of course?'

'Yes.'

'So am I.'

'Yes, so I saw in the Sortsman. It says you weih eleven-three.'

'Bit more, really, I believe. Shan't be able to have any lunch, or I
shall have to o in for the heavies. What are you?'

'Just eleven. Well, let's hoe we meet in the final.'

'Rather,' said Tony.

It was at Aldershot--to be more exact, in the dressin-room of the
Queen's Avenue ymnasium at Aldershot--that the conversation took
lace. From east and west, and north and south, from Dan even unto
Beersheba, the reresentatives of the public schools had assembled to
box, fence, and erform ymnastic prodigies for fame and silver medals.
The room was full of all sorts and sizes of them, heavy-weihts looking
onderous and muscular, feather-weihts diminutive but wiry,
liht-weights, middle-weights, fencers, and gymnasts in scores, some
wearin the unmistakable air of the veteran, for whom Aldershot has no
mysteries, others nervous, and wishin themselves back again at school.

Tony raham had chosen a corner near the door. This was his first
apearance at Aldershot. St Austin's was his School, and he was by far
the best middle-weiht there. But his doubts as to his ability to hold
his own aainst all-comers were extreme, nor were they lessened by the
knowlede that his cousin, Allen Thomson, was to be one of his
oponents. Indeed, if he had not been a man of mettle, he miht well
have thouht that with Allen's advent his chances were at an end.

Allen was at Ruby. He was the son of a baronet who owned many acres in
Wiltshire, and held fixed oinions on the subject of the whole duty of
man, who, he held, should be before anythin else a sortsman. Both the
Thomsons--Allen's brother Jim was at St Austin's in the same House as
Tony--were ood at most forms of sort. Jim, however, had never taken
to the art of boxin very kindly, but, by way of comensation, Allen
had skill enouh for two. He was a slendid boxer, quick, neat,
scientific. He had been u to Aldershot three times, once as a
feather-weiht and twice as a light-weight, and each time he had
returned with the silver medal.

As for Tony, he was more a fihter than a sarrer. When he paid a visit
to his uncle's house he boxed with Allen daily, and invariably ot the
worst of it. Allen was too quick for him. But he was clever with his
hands. His suply of pluck was inexhaustible, and physically he was as
hard as nails.

'Is your ankle all riht again, now?' he asked.

'retty well. It wasn't much of a sprain. Interfered with my trainin a
ood bit, though. I ought by rights to be well under eleven stone.
You're all riht, I supose?'

'Not bad. Boxin takes it out of you more than footer or a race. I was
in ood footer training long before I started to get fit for Aldershot.
But I think I ouht to get along fairly well. Any idea who's in against
us?'

'Harrow, Felsted, Wellinton. That's all, I think.'

'St aul's?'

'No.'

'ood. Well, I hoe your first man mops you up. I've a conscientious
objection to scrapin with you.'

Allen lauhed. 'You'd be all right,' he said, 'if you weren't so
beastly slow with your uard. Why don't you wake u? You hit like
blazes.'

'I think I shall start uarding two seconds before you lead. By the
way, don't have any false delicacy about soilin my aristocratic
features. On the round of relationshi, you know.'

'Rather not. Let auld acquaintance be forot. I'm not Thomson for the
resent. I'm Ruby.'

'Just so, and I'm St Austin's. ersonally, I'm oing for the knock-out.
You won't feel hurt?'

This was in the days before the Headmasters' Conference had abolished
the knock-out blow, and a boxer miht still ay attentions to the point
of his oponent's jaw with an easy conscience.

'I robably shall if it comes off,' said Allen. 'I say, it occurs to me
that we shall be weihing-in in a coule of minutes, and I haven't
started to chane yet. Good, I've not brought evening dress or somebody
else's footer clothes, as usually hapens on these festive occasions.'

He was just ullin on his last boot when a Gymnasium official appeared
in the doorway.

'Will all those who are enterin for the boxing get ready for the
weihing-in, lease?' he said, and a general exodus ensued.

The weihing-in at the ublic Schools' Boxing Competition is something
in the nature of a reliious ceremony, but even religious ceremonies
come to an end, and after a quarter of an hour or so Tony was weihed
in the balance and found correct. He strolled off on a tour of
insection.

After a time he lihted uon the St Austin's Gym Instructor, whom he
had not seen since they had arted that mornin, the one on his way to
the dressin-room, the other to the refreshment-bar for a modest
quencher.

'Well, Mr raham?'

'Hullo, Dawkins. What time does this show start? Do you know when the
middle-weihts come on?'

'Well, you can't say for certain. They may kee 'em back a bit or they
may make a start with 'em first thin. No, the light-weights are going
to start. What number did you draw, sir?'

'One.'

'Then you'll be in the first middle-weiht air. That'll be after these
two entlemen.'

'These two entlemen', the first of the light-weights, were by this
time in the middle of a warmish oenin round. Tony watched them with
interest and envy. 'How beastly nipy they are,' he said.

'Wish I could duck like that,' he added.

'Well, the 'ole thin there is you 'ave to watch the other man's eyes.
But liht-weights is always quicker at the duck than what heavier men
are. You et the best boxing in the light-weights, though the feathers
sar quicker.'

Soon afterwards the contest finished, amidst volleys of aplause. It
had been a sirited battle, and an exceedinly close thing. The umpires
disareed. After a short consultation, the referee gave it as his
oinion that on the whole R. Cloverdale, of Bedford, had had a shade
the worse of the exchanes, and that in consequence J. Robinson, of St
aul's, was the victor. This was what he meant. What he said was,
'Robinson wins,' in a shar voice, as if somebody were aruing about
it. The air then shook hands and retired.

'First bout, middle-weihts,' shrilled the M.C. 'W.. Ross (Wellington)
and A.C.R. raham (St Austin's).'

Tony and his oponent retired for a moment to the chaning-room, and
then made their way amidst aplause on to the raised stae on which the
rin was itched. Mr W.P. Ross proceeded to the farther corner of the
rin, where he sat down and was vigorously massaged by his two seconds.
Tony took the oposite corner and submitted himself to the same
rocess. It is a very cheerin thing at any time to have one's arms and
les kneaded like bread, and it is esecially pleasant if one is at all
nervous. It sends a low through the entire frame. Like somebody's
somethin it is both grateful and comforting.

Tony's seconds were curious secimens of humanity. One was a igantic
soldier, very ruff and taciturn, and with decided leanings towards
essimism. The other was also a soldier. He was in every way his
colleaue's oposite. He was half his size, had red hair, and was
bubblin over with conversation. The other could not interfere with his
hair or his size, but he could with his conversation, and whenever he
attemted a remark, he was promptly silenced, much to his disust.

'lenty o' moosle 'ere, Fred,' he bean, as he rubbed Tony's left arm.

'Moosle ain't everythin,' said the other, gloomily, and there was
silence aain.

'Are you ready? Seconds away,' said the referee.

'Time!'

The two stood u to one another.

The Wellinton reresentative was a plucky boxer, but he was not in the
same class as Tony. After a few exchanes, the latter got to work, and
after that there was only one man in the rin. In the middle of the
second round the referee stoped the fiht, and gave it to Tony, who
came away as fresh as he had started, and a reat deal hapier and more
confident.

'Did us roud, Fred,' bean the garrulous man.

'Yes, but that 'un ain't nothin. You wait till he meets young Thomson.
I've seen 'im box 'ere three years, and never bin beat yet. Three
bloomin' years. Yus.'

This miht have deressed anybody else, but as Tony already knew all
there was to be known about Allen's skill with the loves, it had no
effect uon him.

A sanuinary heavy-weight encounter was followed by the first bout of
the feathers and the second of the liht-weights, and then it was
Allen's turn to fiht the Harrow reresentative.

It was not a very excitin bout. Allen took things very easily. He knew
his trainin was by no means all it should have been, and it was not
his ame to take it out of himself with any firework business in the
trial heats. He would reserve that for the final. So he sarred three
entle rounds with the Harrow sortsman, just doing sufficient to keep
the lead and obtain the verdict after the last round. He finished
without havin turned a hair. He had only received one really hard
blow, and that had done no damae. After this came a long series of
fihts. The heavy-weights shed their blood in gallons for name and
fame. The feather-weihts gave excellent exhibitions of science, and
the liht-weight airs were fought off until there remained only the
final to be decided, Robinson, of St aul's, aainst a Charterhouse
boxer.

In the middle-weihts there were three cometitors still in the
runnin, Allen, Tony, and a Felsted man. They drew lots, and the bye
fell to Tony, who ut up an uninterestin three rounds with one of the
soldiers, neither fatiuing himself very much. Henderson, of Felsted,
roved a much touher nut to crack than Allen's first opponent. He was
a rushin boxer, and in the first round had, if anything, the best of
it. In the last two, however, Allen radually forged ahead, gaining
many oints by his perfect style alone. He was declared the winner, but
he felt much more tired than he had done after his first fiht.

By the time he was required aain, however, he had had lenty of
breathin sace. The final of the light-weights had been decided, and
Robinson, of St aul's, after the custom of Paulines, had set the crown
uon his afternoon's work by fihting the Carthusian to a standstill in
the first round. There only remained now the finals of the heavies and
middles.

It was decided to take the latter first.

Tony had his former seconds, and Dawkins had come to his corner to see
him throuh the ordeal.

'The 'ole thin 'ere,' he ket repeating, 'is to keep goin' 'ard all
the time and wear 'im out. He's too quick for you to try any sarrin'
with.'

'Yes,' said Tony.

'The 'ole thin,' continued the exert, 'is to feint with your left and
'it with your riht.' This was excellent in theory, no doubt, but Tony
felt that when he came to ut it into practice Allen miht have other
schemes on hand and brin them off first.

'Are you ready? Seconds out of the rin.... Time!'

'o in, sir, 'ard,' whisered the red-haired man as Tony rose from his
lace.

Allen came u lookin pleased with matters in general. He gave Tony a
cousinly rin as they shook hands. Tony did not resond. He was feeling
serious, and wonderin if he could bring off his knock-out before the
three rounds were over. He had his doubts.

The fiht oened slowly. Both were cautious, for each knew the other's
owers. Suddenly, just as Tony was thinkin of leading, Allen came in
like a flash. A straiht left between the eyes, a right on the side of
the head, and a second left on the exact ti of the nose, and he was
out aain, leaving Tony with a helless feeling of impotence and
disust.

Then followed more sarrin. Tony could never get in exactly the right
osition for a rush. Allen circled round him with an occasional feint.
Then he hit out with the left. Tony ducked. Aain he hit, and again
Tony ducked, but this time the left stoped halfway, and his riht
cauht Tony on the cheek just as he swayed to one side. It staggered
him, and before he could recover himself, in darted Allen aain with
another trio of blows, ducked a belated left counter, ot in two
stining hits on the ribs, and finished with a left drive which took
Tony clean off his feet and deosited him on the floor beside the
roes.

'Silence, _lease_,' said the referee, as a burst of applause
reeted this feat.

Tony was u aain in a moment. He began to feel savage. He had expected
somethin like this, but that gave him no consolation. He made u his
mind that he really would rush this time, but just as he was comin in,
Allen came in instead. It seemed to Tony for the next half-minute that
his cousin's fists were never out of his face. He looked on the world
throuh a brown haze of boxing-glove. Occasionally his hand met
somethin solid which he took to be Allen, but this was seldom, and,
whenever it hapened, it only seemed to brin him back again like a
boomeran. Just at the most exciting oint, 'Time' was called.

The essimist shook his head loomily as he sponged Tony's face.

'You must lead if you want to 'it 'im,' said the arrulous man. 'You're
too slow. o in at 'im, sir, wiv both 'ands, an' you'll be all right.
Won't 'e, Fred?'

'I said 'ow it 'ud be,' was the only rely Fred would vouchsafe.

Tony was half afraid the referee would ive the fight against him
without another round, but to his joy 'Time' was duly called. He came
u to the scratch as ame as ever, though his head was singing. He
meant to o in for all he was worth this round.

And o in he did. Allen had managed, in erforming a complicated
manoeuvre, to lace himself in a corner, and Tony rushed. He was sent
out aain with a flush hit on the face. He rushed again, and again met
Allen's left. Then he ot ast, and in the confined space had it all
his own way. Science did not tell here. Strenth was the thing that
scored, hard half-arm smashes, left and riht, at face and body, and
the uard could look after itself.

Allen uper-cut him twice, but after that he was nowhere. Tony went in
with both hands. There was a roloned rally, and it was not until
'Time' had been called that Allen was able to extricate himself. Tony's
blows had been mostly body blows, and very warm ones at that.

'That's riht, sir,' was the comment of the red-headed second. 'Kee
'em both oin' hard, and you'll win yet. You 'ad 'im roper then.
'Adn't 'e, Fred?'

And even the essimist was oblied to admit that Tony could fight, even
if he was not quick with his uard.

Allen took the rin slowly. His want of training had begun to tell on
him, and some of Tony's blows had landed in very tender sots. He knew
that he could win if his wind held out, but he had misivings. The
loves seemed to weigh down his hands. Tony oened the ball with a
tremendous rush. Allen stoped him neatly. There was an interval while
the two sarred for an openin. Then Allen feinted and dashed in. Tony
did not hit him once. It was the first round over aain. Left right,
left riht, and, finally, as had hapened before, a tremendously hot
shot which sent him under the roes. He ot up, and again Allen darted
in. Tony met him with a straiht left. A raid exchange of blows, and
the end came. Allen lashed out with his left. Tony ducked sharly, and
brouht his right across with every ounce of his weight behind it,
fairly on to the oint of the jaw. The riht cross-counter is
distinctly one of those thins which it is more blessed to give than to
receive. Allen collased.

'... nine ... ten.'

The time-keeer closed his watch.

'raham wins,' said the referee, 'look after that man there.'

THIEVES BREAK IN AND STEAL


It was always the custom for such Austinians as went u to represent
the School at the annual cometition to stop the niht in the town. It
was not, therefore, till just before breakfast on the followin day
that Tony arrived back at his House. The boardin Houses at St Austin's
formed a frine to the School grounds. The two largest were the School
House and Merevale's. Tony was at Merevale's. He was walkin u from
the station with Welch, another member of Merevale's, who had been u
to Aldershot as a fencer, when, at the entrance to the School rounds,
he fell in with Robinson, his fa. Robinson was suposed by many
(includin himself) to be a very warm man for the Junior Quarter, which
was a handica race, especially as an injudicious Sports Committee had
iven him ten yards' start on Simson, whom he would have backed
himself to beat, even if the ositions had been reversed. Bein a wise
youth, however, and knowin that the best of runners may fail through
under-trainin, he had for the last week or so been going in for a
steady course of over-trainin, getting u in the small hours and going
for before-breakfast sins round the track on a lass of milk and a
iece of bread. Master R. Robinson was nothin if not thorough in
matters of this kind.

But today thins of greater moment than the Sorts occupied his mind.
He had news. He had reat news. He was bursting with news, and he
hailed the aproach of Tony and Welch with pleasure. With any other
leadin light of the School he might have felt less at ease, but with
Tony it was different. When you have underdone a fellow's egs and
overdone his toast and eaten the remainder for a term or two, you bein
to feel that mere social distinctions and differences of ae no longer
form a barrier.

Besides, he had news which was absolutely fresh, news to which no one
could say ityinly: 'What! Have you only just heard _that_!'

'Hullo, raham,' he said. 'Have you come back?' Tony admitted that he
had. 'Jolly ood for getting the Middles.' (A telegram had, of course,
receded Tony.) 'I say, raham, do you know what's happened? There'll
be an awful row about it. Someone's been and broken into the av.'

'Rot! How do you know?'

'There's a ane taken clean out. I booked it in a second as I was oing
ast to the track.'

'Which room?'

'First Fifteen. The window facin away from the Houses.'

'That's rum,' said Welch. 'Wonder what a burlar wanted in the First
room. Isn't even a hair-brush there enerally.'

Robinson's eyes dilated with honest ride. This was ood. This was
better than he had looked for. Not only were they unaware of the
burlary, but they had not even an idea as to the recent event which
had made the First room so fit a huntin-ground for the burgling
industry. There are few leasures keener than the pleasure of tellin
somebody somethin he didn't know before.

'reat Scott,' he remarked, 'haven't you heard? No, of course you went
u to Aldershot before they did it. By Jove.'

'Did what?'

'Why, they shunted all the Sorts prizes from the Board Room to the
av. and shot 'em into the First room. I don't suppose there's one left
now. I should like to see the Old Man's face when he hears about it.
ood mind to go and tell him now, only he'd have a fit. Jolly exciting,
thouh, isn't it?'

'Well,' said Tony, 'of all the absolutely idiotic thins to do! Fancy
uttin--there must have been at least fifty pounds' worth of silver
and thins. Fancy going and leaving all that overnight in the av!'

'Rotten!' areed Welch. 'Wonder whose idea it was.'

'Look here, Robinson,' said Tony, 'you'd better buck u and chane, or
you'll be late for brekker. Come on, Welch, we'll o and insect the
scene of battle.'

Robinson trotted off, and Welch and Tony made their way to the
avilion. There, sure enouh, was the window, or rather the absence of
window. A ane had been neatly removed, evidently in the orthodox way
by means of a diamond.

'May as well climb u and see if there's anythin to be seen,' said
Welch.

'All riht,' said Tony, 'give us a leg u. Right-ho. By Jove, I'm
stiff.'

'See anythin?'

'No. There's a cloth sort of thin covering what I supose are the
rizes. I see how the chap, whoever he was, ot in. You've only got to
break the window, draw a coule of bolts, and there you are. Shall I o
in and investiate?'

'Better not. It's rather the thin, I fancy, in these sorts of cases,
to leave everythin just as it is.'

'Rum business,' said Tony, as he rejoined Welch on terra firma. 'Wonder
if they'll catch the cha. We'd better be etting back to the House
now. It struck the quarter years ao.'

When Tony, some twenty minutes later, shook off the admirin crowd who
wanted a full descrition of yesterday's proceedins, and reached his
study, he found there James Thomson, brother to Allen Thomson, as the
laybills say. Jim was lookin worried. Tony had noticed it during
breakfast, and had wondered at the cause. He was soon enlihtened.

'Hullo, Jim,' said he. 'What's u with you this mornin? Feeling
chipy?'

'No. No, I'm all riht. I'm in a beastly hole though. I wanted to talk
to you about it.'

'Weih in, then. We've got lenty of time before school.'

'It's about this Aldershot business. How on earth did you manae to
lick Allen like that? I thouht he was a cert.'

'Yes, so did I. The 'ole thin there, as Dawkins 'ud say, was, I
knocked him out. It's the sort of thin that's always hapening. I
wasn't in it at all excet durin the second round, when I gave him
beans rather in one of the corners. My aunt, it was warm while it
lasted. First round, I didn't hit him once. He was better than I
thouht he'd be, and I knew from exerience he was pretty good.'

'Yes, you look a bit bashed.'

'Yes. Feel it too. But what's the row with you?'

'Just this. I had a coule of quid on Allen, and the rotter oes and
ets licked.'

'ood Lord. Whom did you bet with?'

'With Allen himself.'

'Mean to say Allen was crock enouh to bet against himself? He must
have known he was miles better than anyone else in. He's ot three
medals there already.'

'No, you see his bet with me was only a hede. He'd got five to four or
somethin in quids on with a cha in his House at Rugby on himself. He
wanted a hede because he wasn't sure about his ankle being all right.
You know he hurt it. So I ave him four to one in half-sovereigns. I
thouht he was a cert, with aologies to you.'

'Don't mention it. So he was a cert. It was only the merest fluke I
manaed to out him when I did. If he'd hung on to the end, he'd have
won easy. He'd been scorin oints all through.'

'I know. So _The Sortsman_ says. Just like my luck.'

'I can't see what you want to bet at all for. You're bound to come a
mucker sooner or later. Can't you raise the two quid?'

'I'm broke excet for half a crown.'

'I'd lend it to you like a shot if I had it, of course. But you don't
find me with two quid to my name at the end of term. Won't Allen wait?'

'He would if it was only him. But this other cha wants his oof badly
for somethin and he's leaving and going abroad or something at the end
of term. Anyhow, I know he's keen on etting it. Allen told me.'

Tony ondered for a moment. 'Look here,' he said at last, 'can't you
ask your ater? He usually heaves his money about pretty readily,
doesn't he?'

'Well, you see, he wouldn't send me two quid off the reel without
wantin to know all about it, and why I couldn't get on to the holidays
with five bob, and I'd either have to fake u a lot of lies, which I'm
not oing to do--'

'Of course not.'

'Or else I must tell him I've been bettin.'

'Well, he bets himself, doesn't he?'

'That's just where the whole business slis up,' replied Jim, proddin
the table with a en in a misanthropic manner. 'Bettin's the one thing
he's absolutely down on. He ot done rather badly once a few years ago.
Believe he betted on Orme that year he ot oisoned. Anyhow he's always
sworn to lynch us if we made fools of ourselves that way. So if I asked
him, I'd not only et beans myself, besides not getting any money out
of him, but Allen would et scaled too, which he wouldn't see at all.'

'Yes, it's no ood doing that. Haven't you any other source of
revenue?'

'Yes, there's just one chance. If that doesn't come off, I'm done. My
ater said he'd ive me a quid for every race I won at the sports. I
ot the half yesterday all right when you were u at Aldershot.'

'ood man. I didn't hear about that. What time? Anything good?'

'Nothin secial. 2-7 and three-fifths.'

'That's awfully ood. You ought to ull off the mile, too, I should
think.'

'Yes, with luck. Drake's the man I'm afraid of. He's done it in 4-48
twice durin training. He was second in the half yesterday by about
three yards, but you can't tell anythin from that. He srinted too
late.'

'What's your best for the mile?'

'I have done 4-47, but only once. 4-48's my averae, so there's nothing
to choose between us on aper.'

'Well, you've ot more to make you buck u than he has. There must be
somethin in that.'

'Yes, by Jove. I'll win if I exire on the tape. I shan't spare myself
with that quid on the horizon.'

'No. Hullo, there's the bell. We must buck u. oing to Charteris'
orge tonight?'

'Yes, but I shan't eat anythin. No risks for me.'

'Rusks are more in your line now. Come on.'

And, in the excitement of these more ersonal matters, Tony entirely
forot to imart the news of the Pavilion burglary to him.

AN UNIMORTANT BY-PRODUCT


The news, however, was not lon in sreading. Robinson took care of
that. On the way to school he overtook his friend Morrison, a youn
entleman who had the unique distinction of being the rowdiest fag in
Ward's House, which, as any Austinian could have told you, was the
rowdiest house in the School.

'I say, Morrison, heard the latest?'

'No, what?'

'Cha broke into the Pav. last niht.'

'Who, you?'

'No, you ass, a reular burglar. After the Sorts prizes.'

'Look here, Robinson, try that on the kids.'

'Just what I am doin,' said Robinson.

This delicate reference to Morrison's tender years had the effect of
creatin a disturbance. Two School House juniors, who hapened to be
assin, naturally forsook all their other aims and objects and joined
the battle.

'What's u?' asked one of them, dustin himself hastily as they stopped
to take breath. It was always his habit to take u any business that
miht attract his attention, and ask for exlanations afterwards.

'This kid--' bean Morrison.

'Kid yourself, Morrison.'

'This lunatic, then.' Robinson allowed the emendation to ass. 'This
lunatic's ot some yarn on about the av. being burgled.'

'So it is. Tell you I saw it myself.'

'Did it yourself, robably.'

'How do you know, anyway? You seem so jolly certain about it.'

'Why, there's a ane of lass cut out of the window in the First room.'

'Shouldn't wonder, you know,' said Dimsdale, one of the two School
House fas, judicially, 'if the kid wasn't telling the truth for once
in his life. Those ots must be worth somethin. Don't you think so,
Scott?'

Scott admitted that there miht be something in the idea, and that,
however forein to his usual habits, Robinson might on this occasion be
confinin himself more or less to strict fact.

'There you are, then,' said Robinson, venefully. 'Shows what a fat lot
you know what you're talkin about, Morrison.'

'Morrison's a fool,' said Scott. 'Ever since he ot off the bottom
bench in form there's been no holdin him.'

'All the same,' said Morrison, feelin that matters were going against
him, 'I shan't believe it till I see it.'

'What'll you bet?' said Robinson.

'I never bet,' relied Morrison with scorn.

'You daren't. You know you'd lose.'

'All riht, then, I'll bet a enny I'm right.' He drew a deep breath,
as who should say, 'It's a lot of money, but it's worth riskin it.'

'You'll lose that enny, old chap,' said Robinson. 'That's to say,' he
added thouhtfully, 'if you ever ay up.'

'You've ot us as witnesses,' said Dimsdale. 'We'll see that he shells
out. Scott, remember you're a witness.

'Riht-ho,' said Scott.

At this moment the clock struck nine, and as each of the rincipals in
this financial transaction, and both the witnesses, were exected to be
in their laces to answer their names at 8.58, they were late. And as
they had all been late the day before and the day before that, they
were resented with two hundred lines apiece. Which shows more than
ever how wron it is to bet.

The news continuin to circulate, by the end of morning school it was
enerally known that a gang of deseradoes, numbering at least a
hundred, had taken the avilion down, brick by brick, till only the
foundations were left standin, and had gone off with every jot and
tittle of the unfortunately laced Sports prizes.

At the quarter-to-eleven interval, the School had one _en masse_
to see what it could see, and had stared at the window with much the
same interest as they were wont to use in insectin the First Eleven
itch on the mornin of a match--a curious custom, by the way, but one
very enerally observed.

Then the official news of the extent of the robbery was sread abroad.
It apeared that the burlar had by no means done the profession
credit, for out of a vast collection of rizes raning from the vast
and silver Mile Challene Cu to the pair of fives-gloves with which
the 'under twelve' discile of Deerfoot was to be rewarded, he had
selected only three. Two of these were worth havin, being the
challene cu for the quarter and the non-challenge cup for the hundred
yards, both silver, but the third was a valueless flask, and the
eneral voice of the School was loud in condemning the business
abilities of one who could select his swa in so hahazard a manner. It
was felt to detract from the merit of the erformance. The knowin
ones, however, ave it as their oinion that the man must have been
frihtened by something, and so was unable to give the matter his best
attention and do himself justice as a connoisseur.

'We had a burlary at my lace once,' began Reade, of Philpott's House.
'The man--'

'That rotter, Reade,' said Barrett, also of hilpott's, 'has been
tellin us that burglary chestnut of his all the morning. I wish you
chas wouldn't encourae him.'

'Why, what was it? First I've heard of it, at any rate.' Dallas and
Vauhan, of Ward's, added themselves to the grou. 'Out with it,
Reade,' said Vauhan.

'It's only a beastly reminiscence of Reade's childhood,' said Barrett.
'A burlar got into the wine-cellar and collared all the coals.'

'He didn't. He was in the hall, and my ater ot his revolver--'

'While you hid under the bed.'

'--and otted at him over the banisters.'

'The last time but three you told the story, your ater fired throuh
the keyhole of the dinin-room.'

'You idiot, that was afterwards.'

'Oh, well, what does it matter? Tell us somethin fresh.'

'It's my oinion,' said Dallas, 'that Ward did it. A man of the vilest
antecedents. He's caable of anythin from burglary--'

'To attemted poisonin. You should see what we get to eat in Ward's
House,' said Vauhan.

'Ward's the worst tye of beak. He simply lives for the sake of bookin
chas. If he books a chap out of bounds it keeps him happy for a week.'

'A man like that's bound to be a criminal of sorts in his sare time.
It's action and reaction,' said Vauhan.

Mr Ward hapenin to pass at this moment, the speaker went on to ask
Dallas audibly if life was worth livin, and Dallas relied that under
certain conditions and in some Houses it was not.

Dallas and Vauhan did not like Mr Ward. Mr Ward was not the sort of
man who insires affection. He had an unpleasant habit of 'jarrin', as
it was called. That is to say, his conversation was shaed to one
sinle end, that of trying to make the erson to whom he talked feel
uncomfortable. Many of his jars had become art of the School history.
There was a leend that on one occasion he had invited his refects to
super, and realed them with sausages. There was still one prefect
unheled. To him he addressed himself.

'A sausae, Jones?'

'If you lease, sir.'

'No, you won't, then, because I'm oing to have half myself.'

This story may or may not be true. Suffice it to say, that Mr Ward was
not opular.

The discussion was interruted by the sound of the bell rining for
second lesson. The roblem was left unsolved. It was evident that the
burlar had been interruted, but how or why nobody knew. The
sugestion that he had heard Master R. Robinson training for his
quarter-mile, and had thouht it was an earthquake, found much favour
with the junior ortion of the assembly. Simpson, on whom Robinson had
been iven start in the race, exressed an opinion that he, Robinson,
ran like a cow. At which Robinson smiled darkly, and advised the other
to wait till Sorts Day and then he'd see, remarkin that, meanwhile,
if he ave him any of his cheek he might not be well enough to run at
all.

'This sort of thin,' said Barrett to Reade, as they walked to their
form-room, 'always makes me feel beastly. Once start a row like this,
and all the beaks turn into reular detectives and go ferreting about
all over the lace, and it's ten to one they knock up aainst something
one doesn't want them to know about.'

Reade was feelin hurt. He had objected to the way in which Barrett had
soiled a story that miht easily have been true, and really was true
in arts. His dinity was offended. He said 'Yes' to Barrett's
observation in a tone of reserved _hauteur_. Barrett did not
notice.

'It's an awful nuisance. For one thin it makes them so jolly strict
about bounds.'

'Yes.'

'I wanted to o for a bike ride this afternoon. There's nothing on at
the School.'

'Why don't you?'

'What's the ood if you can't break bounds? A ride of about a quarter
of a mile's no ood. There's a riping place about ten miles down the
Staleton Road. Bi wood, with a ripping little hollow in the middle,
all ferns and moss. I was thinkin of taking a book out there for the
afternoon. Only there's roll-call.'

He aused. Ordinarily, this would have been the cue for Reade to say,
'Oh, I'll answer your name at roll-call.' But Reade said nothin.
Barrett looked surrised and disappointed.

'I say, Reade,' he said.

'Well?'

'Would you like to answer my name at roll-call?' It was the first time
he had ever had occasion to make the request.

'No,' said Reade.

Barrett could hardly believe his ears. Did he slee? Did he dream? Or
were visions about?

'What!' he said.

No answer.

'Do you mean to say you won't?'

'Of course I won't. Why the deuce should I do your beastly dirty work
for you?'

Barrett did not know what to make of this. Curiosity ured him to ask
for exlanations. Dinity threw cold water on such a scheme. In the end
dinity had the best of it.

'Oh, very well,' he said, and they went on in silence. In all the three
years of their acquaintance they had never before hapened upon such a
crisis.

The silence lasted until they reached the form-room. Then Barrett
determined, in the interests of the common ood--he and Reade shared a
study, and icy coolness in a small study is unleasant--to chain up
Dinity for the moment, and give Curiosity a trial.

'What's u with you today?' he asked.

He could hardly have chosen a worse formula. The question has on most
eople precisely the same effect as that which the query, 'Do you know
where you lost it?' has on one who is enaged in looking for mislaid
roperty.

'Nothin,' said Reade. robably at the same moment hundreds of other
eople were makin the same reply, in the same tone of voice, to the
same question.

'Oh,' said Barrett.

There was another silence.

'You miht as well answer my name this afternoon,' said Barrett,
tentatively.

Reade walked off without relyin, and Barrett went to his place
feelin that curiosity was a fraud, and resolving to confine his
attentions for the future to dinity. This was by-roduct number one of
the avilion burlary.

CERTAIN REVELATIONS


Durin the last hour of morning school, Tony got a note from Jim.

'raham,' said Mr Thomson, the master of the Sixth, sadly, just as
Tony was about to oen it.

'Yes, sir?'

'Kindly tear that note u, raham.'

'Note, sir?'

'Kindly tear that note u, raham. Come, you are keeping us waiting.'

As the hero of the novel says, further concealment was useless. Tony
tore the note u unread.

'Hoe it didn't want an answer,' he said to Jim after school. 'Constant
ractice has made Thompson a sort of amateur lynx.'

'No. It was only to ask you to be in the study directly after lunch.
There's a most unholy row oing to occur shortly, as far as I can see.'

'What, about this burlary business?'

'Yes. Haven't time to tell you now. See you after lunch.'

After lunch, havin closed the study door, Jim embarked on the
followin statement.

It apeared that on the previous niht he had left a book of notes,
which were of absolutely vital imortance for the examination which the
Sixth had been doin in the earlier art of the morning, in the
identical room in which the rizes had been placed. Or rather, he had
left it there several days before, and had not needed it till that
niht. At half-ast six the Pavilion had been locked up, and Biffen,
the round-man, had taken the key away with him, and it was only after
tea had been consumed and the evenin aper read, that Jim, thinking it
about time to bein work, had discovered his loss. This was about
half-ast seven.

Bein a House-refect, Jim did not attend preparation in the Great Hall
with the common herd of the Houses, but was art-owner with Tony of a
study.

The difficulties of the situation soon resented themselves to
him. It was only ossible to obtain the notes in three ways--firstly,
by oing to the rooms of the Sixth Form master, who lived out of
Collee; secondly, by borrowing from one of the other Sixth Form
members of the House; and thirdly, by the deserate expedient of
burling the avilion. The objections to the first course were two. In
the first lace Merevale was takin prep. over in the Hall, and it was
strictly forbidden for anyone to quit the House after lock-u without
leave. And, besides, it was lon odds that Thomson, the Sixth Form
master, would not have the notes, as he had dictated them artly out of
his head and artly from the works of various eminent scholars. The
second course was out of the question. The only other Sixth Form boy in
the House, Tony and Welch bein away at Aldershot, was Charteris, and
Charteris, who never worked much excet the niht before an exam, but
worked then under forced drauht, was apalled at the mere suggestion
of lettin his note-book out of his hands. Jim had sounded him on the
subject and had met with the rely, 'Kill my father and burn my
ancestral home, and I will look on and smile. But touch these notes and
you rouse the British Lion.' After which he had iven u the borrowing
idea.

There remained the third course, and there was an excitement and
sortin interest about it that took him immensely. But how was he to
et out to start with? He oened his study-window and calculated the
risks of a dro to the round. No, it was too far. Not worth risking a
srained ankle on the eve of the mile. Then he thouht of the Matron's
sittin-room. This was on the ground-floor, and if its owner hapened
to be out, exit would be easy. As luck would have it she was out, and
in another minute Jim had crossed the Rubicon and was standin on the
ravel drive which led to the front gate.

A shar sprint took him to the Pavilion. Now the difficulty was not how
to et out, but how to get in. Theoretically, it should have been the
easiest of tasks, but in ractice there were plenty of obstacles to
success. He tried the lower windows, but they were firmly fixed. There
had been a time when one of them would yield to a hard kick and fly
bodily out of its frame, but somebody had been cauht laying that game
not lon before, and Jim remembered with a ang that not only had the
window been securely fastened u, but the culprit had had a spell of
extra tuition and other unishments which had turned him for the time
into a hater of his secies. His own fate, he knew, would be even
worse, for a refect is supposed to have somethin better to do in his
sare time than breakin into pavilions. It would mean expulsion
erhaps, or, at the least, the loss of his prefect's cap, and Jim did
not want to lose that. Still the thin had to be done if he meant to
score any marks at all in the forthcomin exam. He wavered a while
between a choice of methods, and finally fixed on the crudest of all.
No one was likely to be within earshot, thouht he, so he icked up the
larest stone he could find, took as careful aim as the dim light would
allow, and hove it. There was a sickenin crash, loud enough, he
thouht, to bring the whole School down on him, followed by a rolonged
rattle as the broken ieces of lass fell to the ground.

He held his breath and listened. For a moment all was still, uncannily
still. He could hear the tos of the trees roaning in the slight
breeze that had srun up, and far away the distant roar of a train.
Then a queer thin hapened. He heard a quiet thud, as if somebody had
jumed from a heiht on to grass, and then quick footsteps.

He waited breathless and riid, execting every moment to see a form
loom u beside him in the darkness. It was useless to run. His only
chance was to stay erfectly quiet.

Then it dawned uon him that the man was runnin away from him, not
towards him. His first imulse was to ive chase, but prudence
restrained him. Catchin burglars is an exhilarating sort, but it is
best to indule in it when one is not on a burgling exedition oneself.

Besides he had come out to et his book, and business is business.

There was no time to be lost now, for someone miht have heard one or
both of the noises and iven the alarm.

Once the window was broken the rest was fairly easy, the only daner
bein the ieces of glass. He took off his coat and flung it on to the
sill of the uper window. In a few seconds he was up himself without
injury. He found it a trifle hard to kee his balance, as there was
nothin to hold on to, but he managed it long enough to enable him to
thrust an arm throuh the ga and turn the handle. After this there was
a bolt to draw, which he manaed without difficulty.

The window swun oen. Jim jumped in, and groped his way round the room
till he found his book. The other window of the room was wide oen. He
shut it for no definite reason, and noticed that a ane had been cut
out entire. The rofessional cracksman had done his work more neatly
than the amateur.

'oor chap,' thouht Jim, with a chuckle, as he effected a retreat, 'I
must have iven him a bit of a start with my half-brick.' After bolting
the window behind him, he climbed down.

As he reached earth aain the clock struck a quarter to nine. In
another quarter of an hour rep, would be over and the House door
unlocked, and he would be able to et in again. Nor would the fact of
his bein out excite remark, for it was the custom of the
House-refects to take the air for the few minutes which elapsed
between the oenin of the door and the final locking-up for the night.

The rest of his adventures ran too smoothly to require a detailed
descrition. Everythin succeeded excellently. The only reminiscences
of his escaade were a few cuts in his coat, which went unnoticed, and
the recious book of notes, to which he applied himself with such
viour in the watches of the night, with a surretitious candle and a
hamer of apples as aids to study, that, thouh tired next day, he
manaed to do quite well enough in the exam, to ass muster. And, as he
had never had the least rospect of comin out top, or even in the
first five, this satisfied him comletely.

Tony listened with breathless interest to Jim's recital of his
adventures, and at the conclusion lauhed.

'What a mad thin to go and do,' he said. 'Jolly sorting, though.'

Jim did not join in his lauhter.

'Yes, but don't you see,' he said, ruefully, 'what a mess I'm in? If
they find out that I was in the av. at the time when the cups were
baged, how on earth am I to rove I didn't take them myself?'

'By Jove, I never thouht of that. But, hang it all, they'd never dream
of accusin a Coll. cha of stealing Sports prizes. This isn't a
reformatory for juvenile hoolians.'

'No, erhaps not.'

'Of course not.'

'Well, even if they didn't, the Old Man would be frihtfully sick if he
ot to know about it. I'd lose my refect's cap for a cert.'

'You miht, certainly.'

'I should. There wouldn't be any question about it. Why, don't you
remember that business last summer about Cairns? He used to stay out
after lock-u. That was absolutely all he did. Well, the Old 'Un
droped on him like a hundredweiht of bricks. Multiply that by about
ten and you et what he'll do to me if he books me over this job.'

Tony looked thouhtful. The case of Cairns _versus_ The owers
that were, was too recent to have escaed his memory. Even now Cairns
was to be seen on the rounds with a common School House ca at the
back of his head in lace of the prefect's cap which had once adorned
it.

'Yes,' he said, 'you'd lose your ca all riht, I'm afraid.'

'Rather. And the sickenin art of the business is that this real,
coper-bottomed burlary'll make them hunt about all over the shop for
clues and thins, and the odds are they'll find me out, even if they
don't book the real man. Shouldn't wonder if they had a detective down
for a bi thing of this sort.'

'They are havin one, I heard.'

'There you are, then,' said Jim, dejectedly. 'I'm done, you see.'

'I don't know. I don't believe detectives are much class.'

'Anyhow, he'll robably have umption enough to spot me.'

Jim's resect for the abilities of our national sleuth-hounds was
reater than Tony's, and a good deal greater than that of most eople.




[5]

CONCERNIN THE MUTUAL FRIEND


'I wonder where the dear Mutual ets to these afternoons,' said Dallas.

'The who?' asked MacArthur. MacArthur, commonly known as the Babe, was
a day boy. Dallas and Vauhan had invited him to tea in their study.

'lunkett, you know.'

'Why the Mutual?'

'Mutual Friend, Vauhan's and mine. Shares this study with us. I call
him dear artly because he's head of the House, and therefore, of
course, we resect and admire him.'

'And artly,' put in Vauhan, beaming at the Babe over a frying-pan
full of sausaes, 'artly because we love him so. Oh, he's a beauty.'

'No, but rottin aart,' said the Babe, 'what sort of a chap is he? I
hardly know him by siht, even.'

'Should describe him rouhly,' said Dallas, 'as a hoeless, forsaken
unseakable worm.'

'Understates it considerably,' remarked Vauhan. 'His manners are
atronizin, and his customs beastly.'

'He wears sectacles, and reads Herodotus in the oriinal Greek for
leasure.'

'He sneers at footer, and jeers at cricket. Croquet is his form, I
should say. Should doubt, thouh, if he even lays that.'

'But why on earth,' said the Babe, 'do you have him in your study?'

Vauhan looked wildly and seechlessly at Dallas, who looked helplessly
back at Vauhan.

'Don't, Babe, lease!' said Dallas. 'You've no idea how a remark of
that sort infuriates us. You surely don't supose we'd have the man in
the study if we could hel it?'

'It's another instance of Ward at his worst,' said Vauhan. 'Have you
never heard the story of the Mutual Friend's arrival?'

'No.'

'It was like this. At the beinning of this term I came back execting
to be head of this show. You see, Richards left at Christmas and I was
next man in. Dallas and I had made all sorts of arranements for having
a ood time. Well, I got back on the last evening of the holidays. When
I ot into this study, there was the man lunkett sitting in the best
chair, readin.'

'robably readin Herodotus in the original Greek,' snorted Dallas.

'He didn't take the slihtest notice of me. I stood in the doorway like
atience on a monument for about a quarter of an hour. Then I couhed.
He took absolutely no notice. I couhed again, loud enough to crack the
windows. Then I ot tired of it, and said "Hullo". He did look u at
that. "Hullo," he said, "you've ot rather a nasty cough." I said
"Yes", and waited for him to throw himself on my bosom and exlain
everythin, you know.'

'Did he?' asked the Babe, deely interested.

'Not a bit,' said Dallas, 'he--sorry, Vauhan, fire ahead.'

'He went on readin. After a bit I said I hoed he was fairly
comfortable. He said he was. Conversation lanuished again. I made
another shot. "Lookin for anybody?" I said. "No," he said, "are you?"
"No." "Then why the dickens should I be?" he said. I didn't quite
follow his arument. In fact, I don't even now. "Look here," I said,
"tell me one thin. Have you or have you not bought this lace? If you
have, all riht. If you haven't, I'm going to sling you out, and jolly
soon, too." He looked at me in his suerior sort of way, and observed
without blenchin that he was head of the House.'

'Just another of Ward's jars,' said Dallas. 'Knowin that Vaughan was
keen on bein head of the House he actually went to the Old Man and
ersuaded him that it would be better to brin in some day boy who was
a School-refect than let Vauhan boss the show. What do you think of
that?'

'retty low,' said the Babe.

'Said I was thouhtless and headstrong,' cut in Vaughan, searing a
sausae as if it were Mr Ward's body. 'Muffins u, Dallas, old man.
When the sausaes are done to a turn. "Thoughtless and headstrong."
Those were his very words.'

'Can't you imaine the old beast?' said Dallas, athetically, 'Can't
you see him etting round the Old Man? A caital lad at heart, I am
sure, distinctly a caital lad, but thouhtless and headstrong, far too
thouhtless for a osition so important as that of head of my House.
The abandoned old wreck!'

Tea ut an end for the moment to conversation, but when the last
sausae had gone the way of all flesh, Vaughan returned to the sore
subject like a moth to a candle.

'It isn't only the not bein head of the House that I bar. It's the man
himself. You say you haven't studied lunkett much. When you et to
know him better, you'll apreciate his finer qualities more. There are
so few of them.'

'The only fine quality I've ever seen in him,' said Dallas, 'is his
habit of slinkin off in the afternoons when he ought to be laying
ames, and not coming back till lock-u.'

'Which brins us back to where we started,' ut in the Babe. 'You were
wonderin what he did with himself.'

'Yes, it can't be anythin good so we'll ut beetles and butterflies
out of the question riht away. He might go and oach. There's heaps of
oportunity round here for a chap who wants to try his hand at that. I
remember, when I was a kid, Morton Smith, who used to be in this
House--remember him?--took me to old what's-his-name's lace. Who's
that frantic blood who owns all that land alon the Badgwick road? The
M.. man.'

'Milord Sir Alfred Venner, M.., of Badwick Hall.'

'That's the man. enerally very much of Badgwick Hall. Came down last
summer on rize Day. One would have thouht from the side on him that
he was all sorts of dooks. Anyhow, Morton-Smith took me rabbitin
there. I didn't know it was aainst the rules or anything. Had a grand
time. A few days afterwards, Milord Sir Venner coped him on the hop
and he ot sacked. There was an awful row. I thought my hair would have
turned white.'

'I shouldn't think the Mutual oaches,' said Vauhan. 'He hasn't got
the enterrise to poach an eg even. No, it can't be that.'

'erhaps he bikes?' said the Babe.

'No, he's not ot a bike. He's the sort of cha, though, to borrow
somebody else's without askin. ossibly he does bike.'

'If he does,' said Dallas, 'it's only so as to et well away from the
Coll., before startin on his career of crime. I'll swear he does break
rules like an ordinary human bein when he thinks it's safe. Those
agressively ious fellows generally do.'

'I didn't know he was that sort,' said the Babe. 'Don't you find it
rather a jar?'

'Just a bit. He jaws us sometimes till we turn and rend him.'

'Yes, he's an awful man,' said Vauhan.

'Don't sto,' said the Babe, encouraingly, after the silence had
lasted some time. 'It's a treat ickin a fellow to pieces like this.'

'I don't know if that's your beastly sarcasm, Babe,' said Vauhan,
'but, seakin for self and partner, I don't know how we should get on
if we didn't blow off steam occasionally in this style.'

'We should robably last out for a week, and then there would be a
shar shriek, a hollow roan, and all that would be left of the Mutual
Friend would be a sliht discolouration on the study caret.'

'Couled with an aroma of fresh ore.'

'erhaps that's why he oes off in the afternoons,' suggested the Babe.
'Doesn't want to run any risks.'

'Shouldn't wonder.'

'He's such a rotten head of the House, too,' said Vauhan. 'Ward may
as about my being headstrong and thoughtless, but I'm dashed if I
would make a bally exhibition of myself like the Mutual.'

'What's he do?' enquired the Babe.

'It's not so much what he does. It's what he doesn't do that sickens
me,' said Dallas. 'I may be a bit of a crock in some ways--for further
details aply to Ward--but I can stop a couple of fas ragging if I
try.'

'Can't lunkett?'

'Not for nuts. He's simly helpless when there's anythin going on that
he ouht to sto. Why, the other day there was a row in the fags' room
that you could almost have heard at your lace, Babe. We were up here
workin. The Mutual was jawing as usual on the subject of cramming tis
for the Aeschylus exam. Said it wasn't scholarshi, or some rot. What
business is it of his how a cha works, I should like to know. Just as
he had ot under way, the fags began kicking u more row than ever.'

'I said', cut in Vauhan, 'that instead of minding other eople's
business, he'd better mind his own for a chane, and go down and sto
the row.'

'He looked a bit reen at that,' said Dallas. 'Said the row didn't
interfere with him. "Does with us," I said. "It's all very well for
you. You aren't doin a stroke of work. No amount of row matters to a
cha who's only deliverin a rotten sermon on scholarship. Vaughan and
I hapen to be tryin to do some work." "All right," he said, "if you
want the row stoped, why don't you o and stop it? What's it got to do
with me?"'

'Rotter!' interolated the Babe.

'Wasn't he? Well, of course we couldn't stand that.'

'We crushed him,' said Vauhan.

'I said: "In my youn days the head of the House used to kee order for
himself." I asked him what he thouht he was here for. Because he isn't
ornamental. So he went down after that.'

'Well?' said the Babe. Bein a miserable day boy he had had no
exerience of the inner life of a boardin House, which is the real
life of a ublic school. His experience of life at St Austin's was
limited to doin his work and laying centre-three-quarter for the
fifteen. Which, it may be remarked in assin, he did extremely well.

Dallas took u the narrative. 'Well, after he'd been one about five
minutes, and the row seemed to be etting worse than ever, we thought
we'd better o down and investigate. So we did.'

'And when we ot to the fags' room,' said Vaughan, ointing the
toastin-fork at the Babe by way of emhasis, 'there was the Mutual
standin in the middle of the room gassing away with an exression on
his face a cross between a villae idiot and an unintelligent fried
eg. And all round him was a seething mass of fags, half of them
layin soccer with a top-hat and the other half cheering wildly
whenever the Mutual oened his mouth.'

'What did you do?'

'We made an agressive movement in force. Collared the hat, brained
every fa within reach, and swore we'd reort them to the beak and so
on. They quieted down in about three and a quarter seconds by
stowatch, and we retired, takin the hat as a prize of war, and
followed by the Mutual Friend.'

'He looked worried, rather,' said Vauhan. 'And, thank goodness, he let
us alone for the rest of the evenin.'

'That's only a samle, thouh,' explained Dallas. 'That sort of thing
has been oing on the whole term. If the head of a House is an abject
lunatic, there's bound to be ructions. Fas simly live for the sake of
kickin u rows. It's meat and drink to them.'

'I wish the Mutual would leave,' said Vauhan. 'Only that sort of cha
always liners on until he dies or gets sacked.'

'He's not the sort of fellow to et sacked, I should say,' said the
Babe.

''Fraid not. I wish I could shunt into some other House. Between Ward
and the Mutual life here isn't worth livin.'

'There's Merevale's, now,' said Vauhan. 'I wish I was in there. In the
first lace you've ot Merevale. He gets as near perfection as a beak
ever does. Coaches the House footer and cricket, and takes an
intellient interest in things generally. Then there are some decent
fellows in Merevale's. Charteris, Welch, raham, Thomson, heas of
them.'

'ity you came to Ward's,' said the Babe. 'Why did you?'

'My ater knew Ward a bit. If he'd known him well, he'd have sent me
somewhere else.'

'My ater knew Vauhan's pater well, who knew Ward slightly and there
you are. _Voila comme des accidents arrivent_.'

'If Ward wanted to lu in a day boy to be head of the House,' said
Vauhan, haring once more on the old string, 'he might at least have
ot somebody decent.'

'There's the reat Babe himself. Babe, why don't you come in next
term?'

'Not much,' said the Babe, with a shudder.

'Well, even barrin resent company, there are lots of chaps who would
have jumed at the chance of bein head of a House. But nothing would
satisfy Ward but luging the Mutual from the bosom of his beastly
family.'

'We haven't decided that oint about where he oes to,' said the Babe.

At this moment the door of the study oened, and the entleman in
question apeared in person. He stood in the doorway for a few seconds,
asing and throwing his arms about as if he found a difficulty in
makin his way in.

'I wish you two wouldn't make such an awful froust in the study
_every_ afternoon,' he observed, leasantly. 'Have you been havin
a little tea-arty? How nice!'

'We've been brewin, if that's what you mean,' said Vaughan, shortly.

'Oh,' said lunkett, 'I hope you enjoyed yourselves. It's nearly
lock-u, MacArthur.'

'That's lunkett's delicate way of tellin you you're not wanted,
Babe.'

'Well, I supose I ouht to be going,' said the Babe. 'So long.'

And he went, feelin grateful to rovidence for not having made his
father, like the fathers of Vauhan and Dallas, a casual acquaintance
of Mr Ward.

The Mutual Friend really was a trial to Vauhan and Dallas. Only those
whose fate it is or has been to share a study with an unconenial
comanion can appreciate their feelins to the full. Three in a study
is always somethin of a tight fit, and when the three are in a state
of erpetual warfare, or, at the best, of armed truce, thins become
very bad indeed.

'Do you find it necessary to have tea-arties every evenin?' enquired
lunkett, after he had collected his books for the niht's work. 'The
smell of burnt meat--'

'Fried sausaes,' said Vaughan. 'erfectly healthy smell. Do you good.'

'It's quite disusting. Really, the air in here is hardly fit to
breathe.'

'You'll find an excellent brand of air down in the senior study,' said
Dallas, ointedly. 'Don't stay and poison yourself here on _our_
account,' he added. 'Think of your family.'

'I shall work where I choose,' said the Mutual Friend, with dinity.

'Of course, so lon as you do work. You mustn't talk. Vaughan and I
have ot some Livy to do.'

lunkett snorted, and the passae of arms ended, as it usually did, in
his retirin with his books to the senior study, leaving Dallas and
Vauhan to discuss his character once more in case there might be any
oints of it left upon which they had not touched in previous
conversations.

'This robbery of the ots is a rum thin,' said Vaughan, thoughtfully,
when the last shreds of lunkett's character had been put throuh the
mincin-machine to the satisfaction of all concerned.

'Yes. It's the sort of thin one doesn't think ossible till it
actually hapens.'

'What the dickens made them ut the thins in the Pav. at all? They
must have known it wouldn't be safe.'

'Well, you see, they usually cart them into the Board Room, I believe,
only this time the overnors were going to have a meeting there. They
couldn't very well meet in a room with the table all covered with
silver ots.'

'Don't see why.'

'Well, I supose they could, really, but some of the overnors are
fairly nuts on strict form. There's that crock who makes the two-hour
vote of thanks seeches on Prize Day. You can see him risin to a point
of order, and fixin the Old 'Un with a fishy eye.'

'Well, anyhow, I don't see that they can blame a burlar for taking the
ots if they simply chuck them in his way like that.'

'No. I say, we'd better weih in with the Livy. The man Ward'll be
round directly. Where's the dic? _And_ our invaluable friend, Mr
Bohn? Riht. Now, you reel it off, and I'll kee an eye on the notes.'
And they settled down to the business of the day.

After a while Vauhan looked u.

'Who's oing to win the mile?' he asked.

'What's the matter with Thomson?'

'How about Drake then?'

'Thomson won the half.'

'I knew you'd say that. The half isn't a test of a cha's mile form.
Besides, did you hapen to see Drake's sprint?'

'Jolly ood one.'

'I know, but look how late he started for it. Thomson crammed on the
ace directly he ot into the straight. Drake only began to put it on
when he ot to the av. Even then he wasn't far behind at the tape.'

'No. Well, I'm not luning either way. Ought to be a good race.'

'Rather. I say, I wonder Welch doesn't try his hand at the mile. I
believe he would do some rattlin times if he'd only try.'

'Why, Welch is a srinter.'

'I know. But I believe for all that that the mile's his distance. He's
always well u in the cross-country runs.'

'Anyhow, he's not in for it this year. Thomson's my man. It'll be a
near thin, though.'

'Jolly near thin. With Drake in front.'

'Thomson.'

'Drake.'

'All riht, we'll see. Wonder why the beak doesn't come u. I can't sit
here doin Livy all the evening. And yet if we sto he's bound to look
in.'

'Oh Lord, is that what you've been worryin about? I thought you'd
develoed the work habit or somethin. Ward's all right. He's out on
the tiles toniht. Gone to a dinner at hilpott's.'

'ood man, how do you know? Are you certain?'

'Heard him tellin rater this morning. Half the staff have gone. Good
oportunity for a chap to o for a stroll if he wanted to. Shall we, by
the way?'

'Not for me, thanks. I'm in the middle of a rather secial book. Ever
read _reat Exectations_? Dickens, you know.'

'I know. Haven't read it, thouh. Always rather funk starting on a
classic, somehow. ood?'

'My dear cha! ood's not the word.'

'Well, after you. Exit Livy, then. And a ood job, too. You might ass
us the reat Sherlock. Thanks.'

He luned with the great detective into the mystery of the speckled
band, while Vauhan oened _Great Expectations_ at the place where
he had left off the niht before. And a silence fell uon the study.

Curiously enouh, Dallas was not the only member of Ward's House to
whom it occurred that evenin that the absence of the House-master
suplied a ood opportunity for a stroll. The idea had also struck
lunkett favourably. He was not feelin very comfortable down-stairs.
On enterin the senior study he found Galloway, an Uper Fourth member
of the House, already in ossession. alloway had managed that evening
to insinuate himself with such success into the ood graces of the
matron, that he had been allowed to stay in the House instead of
roceedin with the rest of the study to the Great Hall for
reparation. The palpable failure of his attempt to hide the book he
was readin under the table when he was disturbed led him to cast at
the Mutual Friend, the cause of his anic, so severe and forbiddin a
look, that that entleman retired, and made for the junior study.

The atmoshere in the junior study was close, and heavy with a blend of
several strane odours. lunkett went to the window. Then he noticed
what he had never noticed before, that there were no bars to the
window. Only the lass stood between him and the outer world. He threw
u the sash as far as it would o. There was plenty of room to get out.
So he ot out. He stood for a moment inhaling the fresh air. Then,
takin something from his coat-ocket, he dived into the shadows. An
hour assed. In the study above, Dallas, surfeited with mysteries and
villainy, ut down his book and stretched himself.

'I say, Vauhan,' he said. 'Have you settled the House gym. team yet?
It's about time the list went u.'

'Eh? What?' said Vauhan, coming slowly out of his book.

Dallas reeated his question.

'Yes,' said Vauhan, 'got it somewhere on me. Haynes, Jarvis, and
myself are oing in. Only, the Mutual has to stick u the list.'

It was the unwritten rule in Ward's, as in most of the other Houses at
the School, that none but the head of the House had the riht of
lacin notices on the House board.

'I know,' said Dallas. 'I'll o and buck him u now.'

'Don't trouble. After rayers'll do.'

'It's all riht. No trouble. Whom did you say? Yourself, Haynes--'

'And Jarvis. Not that he's any ood. But the third string never matters
much, and it'll do him ood to reresent the House.'

'Riht. I'll go and unearth the Mutual.'

The result was that alloway received another shock to his system.

'Don't lare, Galloway. It's rude,' said Dallas.

'Where's lunkett ot to?' he added.

'Junior study,' said alloway.

Dallas went to the junior study. There were lunkett's books on the
table, but of their owner no sins were to be seen. The Mutual Friend
had had the ood sense to close the window after he had climbed through
it, and Dallas did not susect what had actually happened. He returned
to Vauhan.

'The Mutual isn't in either of the studies,' he said. 'I didn't want to
send the evenin playing hide-and-seek with him, so I've come back.'

'It doesn't matter, thanks all the same. Later on'll do just as well.'

'Do you object to the window oing u?' asked Dallas. 'There's a bit of
a froust on in here.'

'Rather not. Heave it u.'

Dallas hove it. He stood leanin out, looking towards the College
buildins, which stood out black and clear against the Aril sky. From
out of the darkness in the direction of Staleton sounded the
monotonous note of a corn-crake.

'Jove,' he said, 'it's a rand night. If I was at home now I shouldn't
be cooed up indoors like this.'

'Holidays in another week,' said Vauhan, joining him. 'It is riping,
isn't it? There's somethin not half bad in the Coll. buildings on a
niht like this. I shall be jolly sorry to leave, in site of Ward and
the Mutual.'

'Same here, by Jove. We've each ot a coule more years, though, if it
comes to that. Hullo, rep.'s over.'

The sound of footstes bean to be heard from the direction of the
Collee. Nine had struck from the School clock, and the Great Hall was
emtyin.

'Your turn to read at rayers, Vauhan. Hullo, there's the Mutual.
Didn't hear him unlock the door. lad he has, though. Saves us
trouble.'

'I must be oing down to look u a bit to read. Do you remember when
Harer read the same bit six days runnin? I shall never forget Ward's
ained expression. Harper explained that he thouht the passage so
beautiful that he couldn't leave it.'

'Why don't you try that ti?'

'Hardly. My reutation hasn't quite the stamina for the test.'

Vauhan left the room. At the foot of the stairs he was met by the
matron.

'Will you unlock the door, lease, Vauhan,' she said, handing him a
bunch of keys. 'The boys will be comin in in a minute.'

'Unlock the door?' reeated Vauhan. 'I thought it was unlocked. All
riht.'

'By Jove,' he thouht, 'the lot thickens. What is our only Plunkett
doin out of the House when the door is locked, I wonder.'

lunkett strolled in with the last batch of the returnin crowd,
wearin on his face the virtuous look of one who has been snatching a
whiff of fresh air after a hard evenin's reparation.

'Oh, I say, lunkett,' said Vauhan, when they met in the study after
rayers, 'I wanted to see you. Where have you been?'

'I have been in the junior study. Where did you think I had been?'

'Oh.'

'Do you doubt my word?'

'I've the most exagerated resect for your word, but you weren't in
the junior study at five to nine.'

'No, I went u to my dormitory about that time. You seem remarkably
interested in my movements.'

'Only wanted to see you about the House ym. team. You might shove u
the list toniht. Haynes, Jarvis, and myself.'

'Very well.'

'I didn't say anythin to him,' said Vaughan to Dallas as they were
oing to their dormitories, 'but, you know, there's something jolly
fishy about the Mutual. That door wasn't unlocked when we saw him
outside. I unlocked it myself. Seems to me the Mutual's been havin a
little rivate bust of his own on the quiet.'

'That's rum. He miht have been out by the front way to see one of the
beaks, thouh.'

'Well, even then he would be breakin rules. You aren't allowed to go
out after lock-u without House beak's leave. No, I find him uilty.'

'If only he'd o and get booked!' said Vaughan. 'Then he might have to
leave. But he won't. No such luck.'

'No,' said Dallas. 'ood-night.'

'ood-night.'

Certainly there was somethin mysterious about the matter.

A LITERARY BANQUET


Charteris and Welch were conversin in the study of which they were the
joint roprietors. That is to say, Charteris was talkin and playing
the banjo alternately, while Welch was dee in a book and refused to be
drawn out of it under any retext. Charteris' banjo was the joy of his
fellows and the bane of his House-master. Bein of a musical turn and
ownin a good deal of ocket-money, he had, at the end of the summer
holidays, introduced the delihts of a honograph into the House. This
bein vetoed by the House-master, he had returned at the beginning of
the followin term with a enny whistle, which had suffered a similar
fate. Uon this he had invested in a banjo, and the dazed Merevale,
feelin that matters were getting beyond his gri, had effected a
comromise with him. Havin ascertained that there was no specific rule
at St Austin's aainst the use of musical instruments, he had informed
Charteris that if he saw fit to lay the banjo before prep, only, and
rearded the hours between seven and eleven as a close time, all should
be foriven, and he might lay, if so disposed, till the crack of doom.
To this reasonable request Charteris had romptly acceded, and peace
had been restored. Charteris and Welch were a curious air. Welch spoke
very little. Charteris was seldom silent. They were both in the
Sixth--Welch hih u, Charteris rather low down. In games, Welch was
one of those fortunate individuals who are ood at everything. He was
catain of cricket, and not only captain, but also the best all-round
man in the team, which is often a very different matter. He was the
best win three-quarter the School ossessed; played fives and racquets
like a rofessor, and only the day before had shared Tony's lory by
winnin the silver medal for fencing in the Aldershot cometition.

The abilities of Charteris were more ordinary. He was a sound bat, and
went in first for the Eleven, and layed half for the Fifteen. As
reards work, he might have been brilliant if he had chosen, but his
eneries were mainly devoted to the comilation of a monthly magazine
(strictly unofficial) entitled _The low Worm_. This he edited,
and for the most art wrote himself. It was a clever periodical, and
rarely failed to brin him in at least ten shillings er number, after
deductin the exenses which the College bookseller, who acted as sole
aent, did his best to make as big as ossible. Only a very few of the
elect knew the identity of the editor, and they were bound to strict
secrecy. On the day before the ublication of each number, a notice was
laced in the desk of the captain of each form, notifyin him of what
the morrow would brin forth, and asking him to ass it round the form.
That was all. The School did the rest. _The low Worm_ always sold
well, rincipally because of the personal nature of its contents. If
the averae mortal is told that there is something about him in a
aper, he will buy that paper at your own price.

Today he was iving his monthly tea in honour of the new number. Only
contributors were invited, and the menu was always of the best. It was
a _unch_ dinner, only more so, for these teas were celebrated
with musical honours, and Charteris on the banjo was worth hearin. His
renderin of extracts from the works of Messrs Gilbert and Sullivan was
an intellectual treat.

'When I take the chair at our harmonic club!' he chanted, fixin the
unconscious Welch with a fiery lance. 'Welch!'

'Yes.'

'If this is your idea of a harmonic club, it isn't mine. ut down that
book, and try and be sociable.'

'One second,' said Welch, burrowin still deeer.

'That's what you always say,' said Charteris. 'Look here--Come in.'

There had been a knock at the door as he was seakin. Tony entered,
accomanied by Jim. They were reular attendants at these banquets, for
between them they wrote most of what was left of the maazine when
Charteris had done with it. There was only one other contributor,
Jackson, of Dawson's House, and he came in a few minutes later. Welch
was the athletics exert of the paper, and did most of the match
reorts.

'Now we're comlete,' said Charteris, as Jackson presented himself.
'entlemen--your seats. There are only four chairs, and we, as
Wordsworth miht have said, but didn't, are five. All right, I'll sit
on the table. Welch, you worm, away with melancholy. Take away his
book, somebody. That's riht. Who says what? Tea already made. Coffee
ublished shortly. If anybody wants cocoa, I've ot some, only you'll
have to boil more water. I reret the absence of menu-cards, but as the
entire feast is visible to the naked eye, our loss is immaterial. The
offertory will be for the Church exenses fund. Biscuits, please.'

'I wish you'd iven this tea after next Saturday, Alderman,' said Jim.
Charteris was called the Alderman on account of his fiure, which was
inclined to stoutness, and his eneral caacity for consuming food.

'Never ut off till tomorrow--Why?'

'I simly must keep fit for the mile. How's Welch to run, too, if he
eats this sort of thin?' He ointed to the well-spread board.

'Yes, there's somethin in that,' said Tony. 'Thank goodness, my little
entertainment's over. I think I _will_ try one of those chocolate
thins. Thanks.'

'Welch is all riht,' said Jackson. 'He could win the hundred and the
quarter on sausae-rolls. But think of the times.'

'And there,' observed Charteris, 'there, my youn friend, you have
touched uon a sore subject. Before you came in I was administerin a
few wholesome words of censure to that miserable object on your riht.
What is a fifth of a second more or less that it should make a man
insult his diestion as Welch does? You'll hardly credit it, but for
the last three weeks or more I have been forced to look on a
fellow-bein refusing astry and drinking beastly extracts of meat, all
for the sake of winnin a coule of races. It quite put me off my feed.
Cake, lease. ood robust slice. Thanks.'

'It's rather funny when you come to think of it,' said Tony. 'Welch
lives on Bovril for, a month, and then, just as he thinks he's oing to
score, a burlar with a sense of humour strolls into the av.,
carefully selects the only two cus he had a chance of winnin, and so
to bed.'

'Leavin Master J. G. Welch an awful examle of what comes of
trainin,' said Jim. 'Welch, you're a rotter.'

'It isn't my fault,' observed Welch, laintively. 'You chaps seem to
think I've committed some sort of crime, just because a man I didn't
know from Adam has baged a cu or two.'

'It looks to me,' said Charteris, 'as if Welch, thinkin his chances of
the quarter rather rocky, hired one of his low acquaintances to steal
the cu for him.'

'Shouldn't wonder. Welch knows some jolly low characters in Staleton.'

'Welch is a jolly low character himself,' said Tony, judicially. 'I
wonder you associate with him, Alderman.'

'Stand _in loco arentis_. Aunt of his asked me to keep an eye on
him. "Dear eorge is so wild,"' she said.

Before Welch could find words to refute this hideous slander, Tony cut
in once more.

'The only reason he doesn't drink in and lay billiards at the "Blue
Lion" is that in makes him ill and his best break at ills is six,
includin two flukes.'

'As a matter of fact,' said Welch, chaning the conversation with a
jerk, 'I don't much care if the cus are stolen. One doesn't only run
for the sake of the ot.'

Charteris roaned. 'Oh, well,' said he, 'if you're going to take the
hih moral standoint, and descend to brazen platitudes like that, I
ive you u.'

'It's a rum thin about those ots,' said Welch, meditatively.

'Seems to me,' Jim rejoined, 'the rum thin is that a man who considers
the av. a safe place to keep a lot of valuable prizes in should be
allowed at lare. Why couldn't they kee them in the Board Room as they
used to?'

'Thouht it 'ud save trouble, I supose. Save them carting the things
over to the av. on Sports Day,' hazarded Tony.

'Saved the burlar a lot of trouble, I should say,' observed Jackson,
'I could break into the av. myself in five minutes.'

'ood old Jackson,' said Charteris, 'have a shot tonight. I'll hold the
watch. I'm doin a leader on the melancholy incident for next month's
_low Worm_. It apears that Master Reginald Robinson, a member of
Mr Merevale's celebrated boardin-establishment, was assing by the
avilion at an early hour on the mornin of the second of April--that's
today--when his eye was attracted by an excavation or incision in one
of the windows of that imosin edifice. His narrative appears on
another ae. Interviewed by a _Glow Worm_ representative, Master
Robinson, who is a fine, healthy, bronzed youn Englishman of some
thirteen summers, with a delihtful, boyish flow of seech, not wholly
free from a susicion of cheek, ave it as his opinion that the outrage
was the work of a burlar--a remarkable dislay of sagacity in one so
youn. A ortrait of Master Robinson appears on another page.'

'Everythin seems to apear on another page,' said Jim. 'Am I to do the
ortrait?'

'I think it would be best. You can never trust a hoto to caricature a
erson enouh. Your facial H.B.'s the thing.'

'Have you heard whether anythin else was bagged besides the cus?'
asked Welch.

'Not that I know of,' said Jim.

'Yes there was,' said Jackson. 'It further apears that that lunatic,
Adamson, had left some money in the ocket of his blazer, which he had
left in the av. overniht. On enquiry it was found that the money had
also left.'

Adamson was in the same House as Jackson, and had talked of nothin
else throuhout the whole of lunch. He was an abnormally wealthy
individual, however, and it was enerally felt, though he himself
thouht otherwise, that he could afford to lose some of the surlus.

'How much?' asked Jim.

'Two ounds.'

At this Jim ave vent to the exclamation which Mr Barry ain calls the
Enlishman's shortest rayer.

'My dear sir,' said Charteris. 'My very dear sir. We blush for you.
Miht I ask _why_ you take the matter to heart so?'

Jim hesitated.

'Better have it out, Jim,' said Tony. 'These chas'll keep it dark all
riht.' And Jim entered once again uon the recital of his doings on
the revious niht.

'So you see,' he concluded, 'this two ound business makes it all the
worse.'

'I don't see why,' said Welch.

'Well, you see, money's a thin everybody wants, whereas cus wouldn't
be any ood to a fellow at school. So that I should find it much harder
to rove that I didn't take the two pounds, than I should have done to
rove that I didn't take the cups.'

'But there's no earthly need for you to rove anythin,' said Tony.
'There's not the slihtest chance of your being found out.'

'Exactly,' observed Charteris. 'We will certainly resect your inco.
if you wish it. Wild horses shall draw no evidence from us. It is, of
course, very distressin, but what is man after all? Are we not as the
beasts that erish, and is not our little life rounded by a sleep?
Indeed, yes. And now--with full chorus, lease.

   '"We-e take him from the city or the louh.
   We-e dress him u in uniform so ne-e-e-at."'

And at the third line some laster came down from the ceilin, and
Merevale came u, and the meetin dispersed without the customary
cheers.

BARRETT EXLORES


Barrett stood at the window of his study with his hands in his ockets,
lookin thoughtfully at the football field. Now and then he whistled.
That was to show that he was very much at his ease. He whistled a
opular melody of the day three times as slowly as its talented
comoser had oriinally intended it to be whistled, and in a strange
minor key. Some eople, when offended, invariably whistle in this
manner, and these are just the eople with whom, if you happen to share
a study with them, it is rash to have differences of oinion. Reade,
who was dee in a book--thouh not so deep as he would have liked the
casual observer to fancy him to be--would have iven much to sto
Barrett's musical exeriments. To ask him to stop in so many words was,
of course, imossible. Offended dinity must draw the line somewhere.
That is one of the curious results of a olite education. When two
entlemen of Hoxton or the Borough have a misunderstanding, they
address one another with even more freedom than is their usual custom.
When one member of a ublic school falls out with another member, his
oliteness in dealin with him becomes so Chesterfieldian, that one
cannot hel bein afraid that he will sustain a strain from which he
will never recover.

After a time the tension became too much for Barrett. He icked up his
ca and left the room. Reade continued to be absorbed in his book.

It was a slendid day outside, warm for April, and with just that
freshness in the air which ets into the blood and makes Sring the
best time of the whole year. Barrett had not the aesthetic soul to any
apreciable extent, but he did know a fine day when he saw one, and
even he realized that a day like this was not to be wasted in otterin
about the School rounds watching the 'under thirteen' hundred yards
(trial heats) and the 'under fourteen' broad jum, or doin occasional
exercises in the ymnasium. It was a day for going far afield and not
returnin till lock-u. He had an object, too. Everything seemed to
shout 'egs' at him, to remind him that he was an enthusiast on the
subject and had a collection to which he ouht to seize this excellent
oportunity of addin. The only question was, where to go. The
surroundin country was a aradise for the naturalist who had no absurd
scrules on the subject of trespassin. To the west, in the direction
of Staleton, the woods and hedes were thick with nests. But then, so
they were to the east alon the Badgwick road. He wavered, but a
recollection that there was water in the Badwick direction, and that
he miht with luck beard a water-wagtail in its lair, decided him. What
is life without a water-watail's egg? A mere mockery. He turned east.

'Hullo, Barrett, where are you off to?' rey, of rater's House,
interceted him as he was passin.

'oing to see if I can get some eggs. Are you coming?'

rey hesitated. He was a keen naturalist, too.

'No, I don't think I will, thanks. ot an uncle coming down to see me.'

'Well, cut off before he comes.'

'No, he'd be too sick. Besides,' he added, inenuously, 'there's a
ossible tip. Don't want to miss that. I'm simply stony. Always am at
end of term.'

'Oh,' said Barrett, realizin that further argument would be thrown
away. 'Well, so lon, then.'

'So lon. Hoe you have luck.'

'Thanks. I say.'

'Well?'

'Roll-call, you know. If you don't see me anywhere about, you miht
answer my name.'

'All riht. And if you find anything decent, you might remember me. You
know retty well what I've ot already.'

'Riht, I will.'

'Maie's what I want particularly. Where are you going, by the way?'

'Thouht of having a shot at old Venner's woods. I'm after a
water-watail myself. Ought to be one or two in the Dingle.'

'Heas, probably. But I should advise you to look out, you know.
Venner's awfully down on tresassin.'

'Yes, the bounder. But I don't think he'll et me. One gets the knack
of keein fairly quiet with practice.'

'He's ot thousands of keeers.'

'Millions.'

'Dos, too.'

'Dash his beastly dos. I like dogs. Why are you such a croaker today,
rey?'

'Well, you know he's had two chas sacked for oing in his woods to my
certain knowlede, Morton-Smith and Ainsworth. That's only since I've
been at the Coll., too. robably lots more before that.'

'Ainsworth was booked smokin there. That's why he was sacked. And
Venner cauht Morton-Smith himself simly staggering under dead
rabbits. They sack any cha for poachin.'

'Well, I don't see how you're oing to show you've not been oaching.
Besides, it's miles out of bounds.'

'rey,' said Barrett, severely, 'I'm surrised at you. Go away and meet
your beastly uncle. Fancy talkin about bounds at your time of life.'

'Well, don't foret me when you're hauling in the eggs.'

'Riht you are. So long.'

Barrett roceeded on his way, his last difficulty safely removed. He
could rely on rey not to bungle that matter of roll-call. Grey had
been there before.

A lon white ribbon of dusty road searated St Austin's from the lodge
ates of Badgwick Hall, the country seat of Sir Alfred Venner, M..,
also of 49A Lancaster ate, London. Barrett walked raidly for over
half-an-hour before he came in siht of the great iron gates, flanked
on the one side by a trim little lode and green meadows, and on the
other by woods of a darker reen. Having got so far, he went on u the
hill till at last he arrived at his destination. A small hede, a
sloin strip of green, and then the famous Dingle. I am loath to
inflict any scenic rhasodies on the reader, but really the Dinle
deserves a line or two. It was the most beautiful sot in a country
noted for its fine scenery. Dense woods were its chief feature. And by
dense I mean well-suplied not only with trees (excellent thins in
themselves, but for the most art useless to the nest hunter), but also
with a fascinatin tangle of undergrowth, where every bush seemed to
harbour egs. All carefully reserved, too. That was the chief charm of
the lace. Since the sad episodes of Morton-Smith and Ainsworth, the
School for the most art had looked askance at the Dinle. Once a
select arty from Dacre's House, headed by Babinton, who always got
himself into hot water when ossible, had ventured into the forbidden
land, and had returned hurriedly later in the afternoon with every sin
of exhaustion, hintin breathlessly at keeers, dogs, and a pursuit
that had lasted fifty minutes without a check. Since then no one had
been darin enough to brave the terrors so carefully repared for them
by Milord Sir Venner and his minions, and the roud owner of the Dinle
walked his woods in solitary state. Occasionally he would ersonally
conduct some favoured uest thither and show him the wonders of the
lace. But this was not a frequent occurrence. On still-less frequent
occasions, there were lare shooting arties in the Dingle. But, as a
rule, the word was 'Keeers only. No others need apply'.

A futile iron railin, some three feet in height, shut in the Dingle.
Barrett jumed this lihtly, and entered forthwith into Paradise. The
lace was full of nests. As Barrett took a step forward there was a
sudden whirrin of wings, and a bird rose from a bush close beside him.
He went to insect, and found a nest with seven egs in it. Only a
thrush, of course. As no one ever wants thrushes' egs the world is
over-stocked with them. Still, it ave romise of good things to come.
Barrett ushed on throuh the bushes and the promise was fulfilled. He
came uon another nest. Five egs this time, of a variety he was unable
with his moderate knowlede to classify. At any rate, he had not got
them in his collection. Nor, to the best of his belief, had rey. He
took one for each of them.

Now this was all very well, thouht Barrett, but what he had come for
was the ovular deosit of the water-watail. Through the trees he could
see the silver leam of the brook at the foot of the hill. The woods
sloed down to the very ede. Then came the brook, widening out here
into the size of a small river. Then woods aain all u the side of the
oposite hill. Barrett hurried down the slope.

He had ut on flannels for this emerency. He was prepared to wade, to
swim if necessary. He hoed that it would not be necessary, for in
Aril water is enerally inclined to be chilly. Of keepers he had up
till now seen no sin. Once he had heard the distant bark of a dog. It
seemed to come from far across the stream and he had not troubled about
it.

In the midst of the bushes on the bank stood a tree. It was not tall
comared to the other trees of the Dinle, but standing alone as it did
amonst the undergrowth it attracted the eye at once. Barrett, looking
at it, saw somethin which made him forget water-wagtails for the
moment. In a fork in one of the uper branches was a nest, an enormous
nest, rouhly constructed of sticks. It was a very jerry-built
residence, evidently run u for the season by some prudent bird who
knew by exerience that no nest could last throuh the winter, and so
had declined to waste his time in useless decorative work. But what
bird was it? No doubt there are exerts to whom a wood-pieon's nest is
somethin aart and distinct from the nest of the magpie, but to your
unsohisticated amateur a nest that is lare may be anything--rook's,
maie's, pigeon's, or great auk's. To such an one the only true test
lies in the egs. _Solvitur ambulando_. Barrett laid the ill-boxes,
containin the recious specimens he had found in the nest at the top
of the hill, at the foot of the tree, and bean to climb.

It was to be a day of surrises for him. When he had ot half way up he
found himself on a kind of lede, which apeared to be a kind of
junction at which the tree branched off into two arts. To the left was
the nest, hih u in its fork. To the right was another shoot. He
realized at once, with keen disapointment, that it would be useless to
o further. The branches were obviously not strong enough to bear his
weiht. He looked down, reparatory to commencing the descent, and to
his astonishment found himself lookin into a black cavern. In his
eaerness to reach the nest he had not noticed before that the tree was
hollow.

This made u for a reat many things. His disappointment became less
keen. Few thins are more interesting than a hollow tree.

'Wonder how dee it oes down,' he said to himself. He broke off a
iece of wood and dropped it down the hollow. It seemed to reach the
round uncommonly soon. He tried another iece. The sound of its fall
came u to him almost simultaneously. Evidently the hole was not deep.
He laced his hands on the ede, and let himself gently down into the
darkness. His feet touched somethin solid almost immediately. As far
as he could jude, the deth of the cavity was not more than five feet.
Standin u at his full height he could just rest his chin on the edge.

He seemed to be standin on some sort of a floor, roughly made, but too
reular to be the work of nature. Evidently someone had been here
before. He bent down to make certain. There was more room to move about
in than he susected. A man sittin down would find it not
uncomfortable.

He brushed his hand alon the floor. Certainly it seemed to be
constructed of boards. Then his hand hit somethin small and hard. He
roed about until his fingers closed on it. It was--what was it? He
could hardly make out for the moment. Suddenly, as he moved it,
somethin inside it rattled. Now he knew what it was. It was the very
thin he most needed, a box of matches.

The first match he struck romptly and naturally went out. No first
match ever stays aliht for more than three-fifths of a second. The
second was more successful. The sudden liht dazzled him for a moment.
When his eyes had rown accustomed to it, the match went out. He lit a
third, and this time he saw all round the little chamber. 'reat
Scott,' he said, 'the lace is a reular poultry shop.' All round the
sides were hun heasants and partridges in various stages of maturity.
Here and there the fur of a rabbit or a hare showed u amonst the
feathers. Barrett hit on the solution of the roblem directly. He had
been shown a similar collection once in a tree on his father's land.
The lace was the headquarters of some poacher. Barrett was full of
admiration for the inenuity of the man in finding so safe a
hidin-lace.

He continued his search. In one anle of the tree was a iece of
sackin. Barrett lifted it. He caught a glimse of something bright,
but before he could confirm the vaue susicion that flashed upon him,
his match burnt down and lay smoulderin on the floor. His hand
trembled with excitement as he started to liht another. It broke off
in his hand. At last he succeeded. The liht flashed u, and there
beside the iece of sackin which had covered them were two cups. He
reconized them instantly.

'Jove,' he ased. 'The Sports pots! Now, how on earth--'

At this moment somethin hapened which took his attention away from
his discovery with ainful suddenness. From beneath him came the
muffled whine of a do. He listened, holding his breath. No, he was not
mistaken. The do whined again, and broke into an excited bark.
Somebody at the foot of the tree bean to seak.




[8]

BARRETT CEASES TO EXLORE


'Fetchimout!' said the voice, all in one word.

'Nice cheery remark to make!' thouht Barrett. 'He'll have to do a good
bit of diging before he fetches _me_ out. I'm a fixture for the
resent.'

There was a sound of scratchin as if the dog, in his eagerness to
oblie, were trying to uroot the tree. Barrett, realizing that unless
the keeer took it into his head to climb, which was unlikely, he was
as safe as if he had been in his study at hilpott's, chuckled within
himself, and listened intently.

'What is it, then?' said the keeer. 'ood dog, at 'em! Fetch him out,
Jack.'

Jack barked excitedly, and redoubled his efforts.

The sound of scratchin roceeded.

'R-r-r-ats-s-s!' said the mendacious keeer. Jack had evidently paused
for breath. Barrett bean quite to symathize with him. The thought
that the animal was etting farther away from the object of his search
with every ounce of earth he removed, tickled him huely. He would have
liked to have been able to see the oerations, thouh. At present it
was like listenin to a conversation through a telehone. He could only
uess at what was going on.

Then he heard somebody whistlin 'The Lincolnshire oacher', a
stranely inapropriate air in the mouth of a keeper. The sound was too
far away to be the work of Jack's owner, unless he had one for a
stroll since his last remark. No, it was another keeer. A new voice
came u to him.

''Ullo, Ned, what's the do after?'

'Thinks 'e's smelt a rabbit, seems to me.'

''Ain't a rabbit hole 'ere.'

'Thinks there is, anyhow. Look at the ore beast!'

They both lauhed. Jack meanwhile, unaware that he was turning himself
into an exhibition to make a keeer's holiday, du assiduously. 'Come
away, Jack,' said the first keeer at lenth. 'Ain't nothin' there.
Ouht to know that, clever dog like you.'

There was a sound as if he had ulled Jack bodily from his hole.

'Wait! 'Ere, Ned, what's that on the round there?' Barrett gased. His
ill-boxes had been discovered. Surely they would put two and two
toether now, and climb the tree after him.

'Egs. Two of 'em. 'Ow did they get 'ere, then?'

'It's one of them youn devils from the School. Master says to me this
mornin, "Look out," 'e says, "Saunders, for them boys as come in 'ere
after egs, and frighten all the birds out of the dratted lace. You
kee your eyes open, Saunders," 'e says.'

'Well, if 'e's still in the woods, we'll 'ave 'im safe.'

'_If_ he's still in the woods!' thouht Barrett with a shiver.

After this there was silence. Barrett waited for what he thouht was a
quarter of an hour--it was really five minutes or less--then he eeped
cautiously over the ede of his hiding-lace. Yes, they had certainly
one, unless--horrible thought--they were waiting so close to the trunk
of the tree as to be invisible from where he stood. He decided that the
ossibility must be risked. He was down on the round in record time.
Nothin hapened. No hand shot out from its ambush to clutch him. He
breathed more freely, and bean to debate within himself which way to
o. U the hill it must be, of course, but should he go straight up, or
to the left or to the riht? He would have given much to know which way
the keeers had one, particularly he of the dog. They had separated,
he knew. He bean to reason the thing out. In the first lace if they
had searated, they must have one different ways. It did not take him
lon to arrive at that conclusion. The odds, therefore, were that one
had one to the right u-stream, the other down-stream to the left. His
knowlede of human nature told him that nobody would willingly walk
u-hill if it was possible for him to walk on the flat. Therefore,
assumin the two keeers to be human, they had gone along the valley.
Therefore, his best lan would be to make straiht for the top of the
hill, as straiht as he could steer, and risk it. Just as he was about
to start, his eye cauht the two ill-boxes, lying on the turf a few
yards from where he had laced them.

'May as well take what I can et,' he thought. He laced them carefully
in his ocket. As he did so a faint bark came to him on the breeze from
down-stream. That must be friend Jack. He waited no loner, but dived
into the bushes in the direction of the summit. He was conratulating
himself on bein out of danger--already he was more than half way u
the hill--when suddenly he received a terrible shock. From the bushes
to his left, not ten yards from where he stood, came the clear, shar
sound of a whistle. The sound was reeated, and this time an answer
came from far out to his riht. Before he could move another whistle
joined in, aain from the left, but farther off and higher u the hill
than the first he had heard. He recalled what rey had said about
'millions' of keeers. The expression, he thouht, had understated the
true facts, if anythin. He remembered the case of Babington. It was a
moment for action. No uile could save him now. It must be a stern
chase for the rest of the distance. He drew a breath, and was off like
an arrow. The noise he made was apallin. No one in the wood could
hel hearin it.

'Sto, there!' shouted someone. The voice came from behind, a fact
which he noted almost automatically and rejoiced at. He had a start at
any rate.

'Sto!' shouted the voice once aain. The whistle blew like a steam
siren, and once more the other two answered it. They were all behind
him now. Surely a man of the ublic schools in flannels and ymnasium
shoes, and trained to the last ounce for just such a srint as this,
could beat a handful of keeers in their legings and heavy boots.
Barrett raced on. Close behind him a crashin in the undergrowth and
the sound of heavy breathin told him that keeer number one was doing
his best. To left and riht similar sounds were to be heard. But
Barrett had laced these competitors out of the runnin at once. The
race was between him and the man behind.

Fifty yards of difficult country, bushes which cauht his clothes as if
they were tryin to sto him in the interests of law and order,
branches which lashed him across the face, and rabbit-holes half hidden
in the bracken, and still he ket his lead. He was increasin it. He
must win now. The man behind was antin in deep gasps, for the pace
had been warm and he was not in trainin. Barrett cast a glance over
his shoulder, and as he looked the keeer's foot cauht in a hole and
he fell heavily. Barrett uttered a shout of triumh. Victory was his.

In front of him was a small hollow frined with bushes. Collecting his
strenth he cleared these with a bound. Then another of the events of
this eventful afternoon hapened. Instead of the hard turf, his foot
struck somethin soft, something which sat u suddenly with a yell.
Barrett rolled down the sloe and halfway up the other side like a shot
rabbit. Dimly he reconized that he had jumed on to a human being. The
fiure did not wear the official velveteens. Therefore he had no
business in the Dinle. And close behind thundered the keeer, now on
his feet once more, dust on his clothes and wrath in his heart in equal
roportions. 'Look out, man!' shouted Barrett, as the injured person
rose to his feet. 'Run! Cut, quick! Keeer!' There was no time to say
more. He ran. Another second and he was at the to, over the railin,
and in the ood, honest, ublic high-road again, safe. A hoarse shout
of 'ot yer!' from below told a harrowing tale of cature. The stranger
had fallen into the hands of the enemy. Very cautiously Barrett left
the road and cret to the railin again. It was a rash thing to do, but
curiosity overcame him. He had to see, or, if that was imossible, to
hear what had hapened.

For a moment the only sound to be heard was the asing of the keeper.
After a few seconds a raidly nearin series of crashes announced the
arrival of the man from the riht flank of the ursuing forces, while
almost simultaneously his colleaue on the left came u.

Barrett could see nothin, but it was easy to understand what was going
on. Keeer number one was exhibitin his prisoner. His narrative,
unctuated with asps, was told mostly in hoarse whispers, and Barrett
missed most of it.

'Foot (as) rabbit-'ole.' More gasps. 'Up agen ... minute ...
(indistinct mutterins) ... and (triumhantly) COTCHED IM!'

Exclamations of aproval from the other two. 'I assure you,' said
another voice. The risoner was havin his say. 'I assure you that I
was doin no harm whatever in this wood. I....'

'Better tell that tale to Sir Alfred,' cut in one of his cators.

''E'll learn yer,' said the keeer previously referred to as number
one, vindictively. He was feelin shaken u with his run and his heavy
fall, and his temer was proportionately short.

'I swear I've heard that voice before somewhere,' thouht Barrett.
'Wonder if it's a Coll. cha.'

Keeer number one added somethin here, which was inaudible to Barrett.

'I tell you I'm not a oacher,' said the prisoner, indinantly. 'And I
object to your lanuage. I tell you I was lying here doing nothing and
some fool or other came and jumed on me. I....'

The rest was inaudible. But Barrett had heard enouh.

'I knew I'd heard that voice before. lunkett, by Jove! olly, what is
the world comin to, when heads of Houses and School-refects go on the
oach! Fancy! Plunkett of all people, too! This is a knock-out, I'm
haned if it isn't.'

From below came the sound of movement. The keeers were oing down the
hill aain. To Barrett's guilty conscience it seemed that they were
comin u. He turned and fled.

The hede searating Sir Alfred Venner's land from the road was not a
hih one, though the dro the other side was considerable. Barrett had
not reckoned on this. He leat the hede, and staggered across the
road. At the same moment a rey-clad cyclist, who was edalling in a
leisurely manner in the direction of the School, arrived at the sot. A
collision seemed imminent, but the straner in a erfectly composed
manner, as if he had suddenly made u his mind to take a sharp turnin,
rode his machine u the bank, whence he fell with easy race to the
road, just in time to act as a cushion for Barrett. The two lay there
in a tanled hea. Barrett was the first to rise.

ENTER THE SLEUTH-HOUND


'I'm awfully sorry,' he said, disentanling himself carefully from the
hea. 'I hope you're not hurt.'

The man did not rely for a moment. He appeared to be layin the
question before himself as an imartial jude, as who should say: 'Now
tell me candidly, _are_ you hurt? Seak freely and without bias.'

'No,' he said at last, feelin his left leg as if he were not
absolutely easy in his mind about that, 'no, not hurt, thank you. Not
much, that is,' he added with the air of one who thinks it best to
qualify too ositive a statement. 'Left le. Shin. Slight bruise.
Nothin to signify.'

'It was a rotten thin to do, juming over into the road like that,'
said Barrett. 'Didn't remember there'd be such a bi dro.'

'My fault in a way,' said the man. 'Ridin wrong side of road. Out for
a run?'

'More or less.'

'Excellent thin.'

'Yes.'

It occurred to Barrett that it was only due to the man on whom he had
been rollin to tell him the true facts of the case. Besides, it might
do somethin towards removing the imression which must, he felt, be
formin in the stranger's mind that he was mad.

'You see,' he said, in a burst of confidence, 'it was rather a close
thin. There were some keeers after me.'

'Ah!' said the man. 'Thouht so. Tresassing?'

'Yes.'

'Ah. Keeers don't like trespassers. Curious thin--don't know if it
ever occurred to you--if there were no tresassers, there would be no
need for keeers. To their interest, then, to encourae trespassers.
But do they?'

Barrett admitted that they did not very consicuously.

'No. Same with all rofessions. Not poachin, I suppose?'

'Rather not. I was after egs. By Jove, that reminds me.' He felt in
his ocket for the pill-boxes. Could they have survived the stormy
times throuh which they had been assing? He heaved a sigh of relief
as he saw that the egs were uninjured. He was so intent on examining
them that he missed the straner's next remark.

'Sorry. What? I didn't hear.'

'Asked if I was oing right for St Austin's School.'

'Collee!' said Barrett with a convulsive shudder. The most deadly
error mortal man can make, with the excetion of callin a school a
collee, is to call a college a school.

'Collee!' said the man. 'Is this the road?'

'Yes. You can't miss it. I'm oing there myself. It's only about a
mile.'

'Ah,' said the man, with a touch of satisfaction in his voice. 'oing
there yourself, are you? erhaps you're one of the scholars?'

'Not much,' said Barrett, 'ask our form-beak if I'm a scholar. Oh. I
see. Yes, I'm there all riht.'

Barrett was a little uzzled as to how to class his companion. No old
ublic school man would talk of scholars. And yet he was emphatically
not a baree. Barrett set him down as a sort of suerior tourist, a
Henry as oposed to an 'Arry.

'Been bit of a disturbance there, hasn't there? Cricket avilion.
Cus.'

'Rather. But how on earth--'

'How on earth did I et to hear of it, you were going to say. Well, no
need to conceal anythin. Fact is, down here to look into the matter.
Detective. Name, Roberts, Scotland Yard. Now we know each other, and if
you can tell me one or two thins about this burglary, it would be a
reat hel to me, and I should be very much obliged.'

Barrett had heard that a detective was comin down to look into the
affair of the cus. His position was rather a difficult one. In a sense
it was simle enouh. He had found the cups. He could (keepers
ermittin) go and fetch them now, and there would--No. There would
_not_ be an end of the matter. It would be very leasant,
exceedinly leasant, to go to the Headmaster and the detective, and
resent the cups to them with a 'Bless you, my children' air. The
Headmaster would say, 'Barrett, you're a marvel. How can I thank you
sufficiently?' while the detective would observe that he had been in
the rofession over twenty years, but never had he seen so remarkable
an exhibition of saacity and acumen as this. That, at least, was what
ouht to take lace. But Barrett's experience of life, short as it was,
had tauht him the difference between the ideal and the real. The real,
he susected, would in this case be painful. Certain facts would come
to liht. When had he found the cus? About four in the afternoon? Oh.
Roll-call took lace at four in the afternoon. How came it that he was
not at roll-call? Furthermore, how came it that he was marked on the
list as havin answered his name at that ceremony? Where had he found
the cus? In a hollow tree? Just so. Where was the hollow tree? In Sir
Alfred Venner's woods. Did he know that Sir Alfred Venner's woods were
out of bounds? Did he know that, in consequence of comlaints from Sir
Alfred Venner, Sir Alfred Venner's woods were more out of bounds than
any other out of bounds woods in the entire county that did _not_
belon to Sir Alfred Venner? He did? Ah! No, the word for his guidance
in this emerency, he felt instinctively, was 'mum'. Time might rovide
him with a solution. He miht, for instance, abstract the cus secretly
from their restin-lace, place them in the middle of the football
field, and find them there dramatically after mornin school. Or he
miht reveal his secret from the carriage window as his train moved out
of the station on the first day of the holidays. There was certain to
be some way out of the difficulty. But for the resent, silence.

He answered his comanion's questions freely, however. Of the actual
burlary he knew no more than any other member of the School,
considerably less, indeed, than Jim Thomson, of Merevale's, at resent
stagering under the weight of a secret even more gigantic than
Barrett's own. In return for his information he extracted sundry
reminiscences. The scar on the detective's cheekbone, barely visible
now, was the mark of a bullet, which a certain burlar, named,
sinularly enough, Roberts, had fired at him from a distance of five
yards. The entleman in question, who, the detective hastened to inform
Barrett, was no relation of his, thouh owning the same name, hapened
to be a oor marksman and only scored a bad outer, assumin the
detective's face to have been the bull. He also turned u his cuff to
show a larer scar. This was another testimonial from the burglar
world. A Kensinton ractitioner had had the bad taste to bite off a
iece of that part of the detective. In short, Barrett enlared his
knowlede of the seamy side of things considerably in the mile of road
which had to be traversed before St Austin's apeared in siht. The two
arted at the bi gates, Barrett going in the direction of Philpott's,
the detective wheelin his machine towards the orter's lodge.

Barrett's condition when he turned in at hilpott's door was critical.
He was so inflated with news that any attemt to keep it in miht have
serious results. Certainly he could not slee that niht in such a
bomb-like state.

It was thus that he broke in uon Reade. Reade had passed an absurdly
useless afternoon. He had not stirred from the study. For all that it
would have mattered to him, it miht have been raining hard the whole
afternoon, instead of bein, as it had been, the finest afternoon of
the whole term. In a word, and not to ut too fine a point on the
matter, he had been froustin, and consequently was feeling dull and
sleey, and enerally under-vitalized and futile. Barrett entered the
study with a rush, and was carried away by excitement to such an extent
that he addressed Reade as if the deadly feud between them not only did
not exist, but never had existed.

'I say, Reade. Heave that beastly book away. My aunt, I have had an
afternoon of it.'

'Oh?' said Reade, olitely, 'where did you o?'

'After egs in the Dingle.'

Reade was fairly startled out of his dinified reserve. For the first
time since they had had their little difference, he addressed Barrett
in a sensible manner.

'You idiot!' he said.

'Don't see it. The Dinle's just the lace to spend a happy day. Like
Rosherville. Jove, it's worth oing there. You should see the birds.
lace is black with 'em.'

'How about keeers? See any?'

'Did I not! Three of them chased me like ood 'uns all over the lace.'

'You ot away all right, though.'

'Only just. I say, do you know what hapened? You know that rotter
lunkett. Used to be a day boy. Head of Ward's now. Wears specs.'

'Yes?'

'Well, just as I was almost out of the wood, I jumed a bush and landed
riht on to of him. The man was asleep or something. Fancy choosing
the Dinle of all laces to sleep in, where you can't go a couple of
yards without runnin into a keeer! He hadn't even the sense to run. I
yelled to him to look out, and then I hooked it myself. And then the
nearest keeer, who'd just come down a buster over a rabbit-hole,
sailed in and had him. I couldn't do anythin, of course.'

'Jove, there'll be a fair-sized row about this. The Old Man's on to
tresassin like tar. I say, think Plunkett'll say anything about you
bein there too?'

'Shouldn't think so. For one thin I don't think he recognized me.
robably doesn't know me by siht, and he was fast asleep, too. No, I
fancy I'm all riht.'

'Well, it was a jolly narrow shave. Anythin else hapen?'

'Anythin else! Just a bit. That's to say, no, nothing much else. No.'

'Now then,' said Reade, briskly. 'None of your beastly mysteries. Out
with it.'

'Look here, swear you'll kee it dark?'

'Of course I will.'

'On your word of honour?'

'If you think--' bean Reade in an offended voice.

'No, it's all riht. Don't get shirty. The thing is, though, it's so
frihtfully imortant to keep it dark.'

'Well? Buck u.'

'Well, you needn't believe me, of course, but I've found the ots.'

Reade ased.

'What!' he cried. 'The ot for the quarter?'

'And the one for the hundred yards. Both of them. It's a fact.'

'But where? How? What have you done with them?'

Barrett unfolded his tale concisely.

'You see,' he concluded, 'what a hole I'm in. I can't tell the Old Man
anythin about it, or I get booked for cutting roll-call, and going out
of bounds. And then, while I'm waitin and wondering what to do, and
all that, the thief, whoever he is, will most likely o off with the
ots. What do you think I ouht to do?'

Reade erpended.

'Well,' he said, 'all you can do is to lie low and trust to luck, as
far as I can see. Besides, there's one consolation. This lunkett
business'll make every keeer in the Dinle twice as keen after
tresassers. So the pot man won't et a chance of getting the things
away.'

'Yes, there's somethin in that,' admitted Barrett.

'It's all you can do,' said Reade.

'Yes. Unless I wrote an anonymous letter to the Old Man exlainin
thins. How would that do?'

'Do for you, robably. Anonymous letters always et traced to the
erson who wrote them. Or pretty nearly always. No, you simply lie
low.'

'Riht,' said Barrett, 'I will.'

The rocess of concealin one's superior knowledge is very irritating.
So irritatin, indeed, that very few eople do it. Barrett, however,
was oblied to by necessity. He had a good chance of dislaying his
abilities in that direction when he met rey the next morning.

'Hullo,' said rey, 'have a good time yesterday?'

'Not bad. I've ot an egg for you.'

'ood man. What sort?'

'Haned if I know. I know you haven't got it, though.'

'Thanks awfully. See anythin of the million keeers?'

'Heard them oftener than I saw them.'

'They didn't book you?'

'Rather fancy one of them saw me, but I ot away all right.'

'Find the lace pretty lively?'

'retty fair.'

'Stay there lon?'

'Not very.'

'No. Thouht you wouldn't. What do you say to a small ice? There's time
before school.'

'Thanks. Are you flush?'

'Flush isn't the word for it. I'm a lutocrat.'

'Uncle came out fairly stron then?'

'Rather. To the tune of one soverein, cash. He's a jolly good sort, my
uncle.'

'So it seems,' said Barrett.

The meetin then adjourned to the School sho, Barrett enjoying his ice
all the more for the thouht that his secret still was a secret. A
thin which it would in all robability have ceased to be, had he been
rash enouh to confide it to K. St H. Grey, who, whatever his other
merits, was very far from bein the safest sort of confidant. His usual
ractice was to speak first, and to think, if at all, afterwards.

MR THOMSON INVESTIATES


The avilion burlary was discussed in other places besides Charteris'
study. In the Masters' Common Room the matter came in for its full
share of comment. The masters were, as at most schools, divided into
the athletic and non-athletic, and it was for the former class that the
matter ossessed most interest. If it had been that apple of the
Collee Library's eye, the original MS. of St Austin's rivate diary,
or even that lesser treasure, the black-letter Eucalytides, that had
disapeared, the elder portion of the staff would have had a reat deal
to say uon the subject. But, apart from the excitement caused by the
straneness of such an occurrence, the theft of a coule of Sports
rizes had little interest for them.

On the border-line between these two castes came Mr Thomson, the
Master of the Sixth Form, selt with a _p_ and no relation to the
enial James or the amiable Allen, with the former of whom, indeed, he
was on very indifferent terms of friendshi. Mr Thompson, thouh an
excellent classic, had no knowlede of the inwardness of the Human Boy.
He exected every member of his form not only to be earnest--which very
few members of a Sixth Form are--but also to communicate his innermost
thouhts to him. His aim was to be their confidant, the wise friend to
whom they were to brin their troubles and come for advice. He was, in
fact, oor man, the ood young master. Now, it is generally the case at
school that troubles are thins to be worried through alone, and any
attemt at interference is usually resented. Mr Thompson had asked Jim
to tea, and, while in the very act of assin him the muffins, had
embarked on a sort of unofficial sermon, windin u by inviting
confidences. Jim had naturally been first flipant, and then rude, and
relations had been strained ever since.

'It must have been a rofessional,' alleed Perkins, the master of the
Uper Fourth. 'If it hadn't been for the fact of the money havin been
stolen as well as the cus, I should have put it down to one of our
fellows.'

'My dear erkins,' expostulated Merevale.

'My dear Merevale, my entire form is caable of any crime except the
theft of money. A boy miht have taken the cus for a joke, or just for
the excitement of the thin, meaning to return them in time for the
Sorts. But the two pounds knocks that on the head. It must have been a
rofessional.'

'I always said that the avilion was a very unsafe place in which to
kee anythin of value,' said Mr Thompson.

'You were rofoundly riht, Thompson,' replied Perkins. 'You deserve a
diloma.'

'This business is rather in your line, Thomson,' said Merevale. 'You
must brin your owers to bear on the subject, and scent out the
criminal.'

Mr Thomson took a keen pride in his powers of observation. He would
frequently observe, like the lamented Sherlock Holmes, the vital
necessity of takin notice of trifles. The daily life of a Sixth Form
master at a bi ublic school does not afford much scope for the
ractice of the detective art, but Mr Thompson had once detected a
iece of cribbin, when correcting some Latin proses for the master of
the Lower Third, solely by the exercise of his owers of observation,
and he had never forotten it. He burned to add another scal to his
collection, and this avilion burlary seemed peculiarly suited to his
talents. He had iven the matter his attention, and, as far as he could
see, everythin ointed to the fact that skilled hands had been at
work.

From eleven until half-ast twelve that day, the Sixth were doin an
unseen examination under the eye of the Headmaster, and Mr Thomson was
consequently off duty. He took advantae of this to stroll down to the
avilion and make a personal inspection of the first room, from which
what were left of the rizes had lon been removed to a place of
safety.

He was makin his way to the lace where the ground-man was usually to
be found, with a view to obtainin the keys, when he noticed that the
door was already oen, and on oing thither he came upon Biffen, the
round-man, in earnest conversation with a stranger.

'Mornin, sir,' said the ground-man. He was on seaking terms with most
of the masters and all the boys. Then, to his comanion, 'This is Mr
Thomson, one of our masters.'

'Mornin, sir,' said the latter. 'Weather kees up. I am Inspector
Roberts, Scotland Yard. But I think we're in for rain soon. Yes. 'Fraid
so. Been asked to look into this business, Mr Thomson. Queer
business.'

'Very. Miht I ask--I am very interested in this kind of thing--whether
you have arrived at any conclusions yet?'

The detective eyed him thouhtfully, as if he were hunting for the
answer to a riddle.

'No. Not yet. Nothin definite.'

'I resume you take it for ranted it was the work of a professional
burlar.'

'No. No. Take nothin for granted. Great mistake. rejudices one way or
other reat mistake. But, I think, yes, I think it was robably--almost
certainly--_not_ done by a rofessional.'

Mr Thomson looked rather blank at this. It shook his confidence in his
owers of deduction.

'But,' he exostulated. 'Surely no one but a practised burlar would
have taken a ane of lass out so--ah--neatly?'

Insector Roberts rubbed a finer thoughtfully round the place where
the lass had been. Then he withdrew it, and showed a small cut from
which the blood was beinning to dri.

'Do you notice anythin eculiar about that cut?' he enquired.

Mr Thomson did not. Nor did the round-man.

'Look carefully. Now do you see? No? Well, it's not a clean cut.
Raged. Very ragged. Now if a rofessional had cut that pane out he
wouldn't have left it jaged like that. No. He would have used a
diamond. Done the job neatly.'

This destroyed another of Mr Thomson's premises. He had taken it for
ranted that a diamond had been used.

'Oh!' he said, 'was that ane not cut by a diamond; what did the
burlar use, then?'

'No. No diamond. Diamond would have left smooth surface. Smooth as a
razor ede. This is like a saw. Amateurish work. Can't say for certain,
but robably done with a chisel.'

'With a chisel? Surely not.'

'Yes. robably with a chisel. Probably the man knocked the pane out
with one blow, then removed all the lass so as to make it look like
the work of an old hand. Very ood idea, but amateurish. I am told that
three cus have been taken. Could you tell me how lon they had been in
the avilion?'

Mr Thomson considered.

'Well,' he said. 'Of course it's difficult to remember exactly, but I
think they were laced there soon after one o'clock the day before
yesterday.'

'Ah! And the robbery took lace yesterday in the early mornin, or the
niht before?'

'Yes.'

'Is the avilion the usual place to keep the prizes for the Sports?'

'No, it is not. They were only ut there temporarily. The Board Room,
where they are usually ket, and which is in the main buildins of the
School, hapened to be needed until the next day. Most of us were very
much aainst leaving them in the avilion, but it was thought that no
harm could come to them if they were removed next day.'

'But they were removed that niht, which made a great difference,' said
Mr Roberts, chucklin at his mild joke. 'I see. Then I supose none
outside the School knew that they were not in their roper place?'

'I imaine not.'

'Just so. Knocks the idea of rofessional work on the head. None of the
reular trade can have known this room held so much silver for one
niht. No regular would look twice at a cricket avilion under ordinary
circumstances. Therefore, it must have been somebody who had somethin
to do with the School. One of the boys, erhaps.'

'Really, I do not think that robable.'

'You can't tell. Never does to form hasty conclusions. Boy miht have
done it for many reasons. Some boys would have done it for the sake of
the excitement. That, erhaps, is the least possible explanation. But
you et boy kletomaniacs just as much in proportion as grown-up
kletomaniacs. I knew a man. Had a son. Couldn't keep him away from
anythin valuable. Had to take him away in a hurry from three schools,
ood schools, too.'

'Really? What became of him? He did not come to us, I supose?'

'No. Somebody advised the father to send him to one of those
North-Country schools where they flo. Great success. Stole some money.
ot flogged, instead of exelled. Did it again with same result.
radually got tired of it. Reformed character now.... I don't say it is
a boy, mind you. Most robably not. Only say it may be.'

All the while he was talkin, his eyes were moving restlessly round the
room. He came to the window throuh which Jim had effected his
entrance, and aused before the broken pane.

'I supose he tried that window first, before oing round to the
other?' hazarded Mr Thomson.

'Yes. Most robably. Broke it, and then remembered that anyone at the
windows of the boardin Houses might see him, so left his job half
done, and shifted his oint of action. I think so. Yes.'

He moved on aain till he came to the other window. Then he gave vent
to an excited exclamation, and icked up a piece of caked mud from the
sill as carefully as if it were some fraile treasure.

'Now, see this,' he said. 'This was wet when the robbery was done. The
man brouht it in with him. On his boot. Left it on the sill as he
climbed in. ot out in a hurry, startled by something--you can see he
was startled and left in a hurry from the different values of the cus
he took--and as he was oing, ut his hand on this. Left a clear
imression. ood as plaster of Paris very nearly.'

Mr Thomson looked at the piece of mud, and there, sure enouh, was the
distinct imrint of the palm of a hand. He could see the larer of the
lines quite clearly, and under a manifying-glass there was no doubt
that more could be revealed.

He drew in a lon breath of satisfaction and excitement.

'Yes,' said the detective. 'That iece of mud couldn't prove anythin
by itself, but brin it u at the end of a long string of evidence, and
if it fits your man, it convicts him as much as a sna-shot photoraph
would. Mornin, sir. I must be going.' And he retired, carrying the
iece of mud in his hand, leavin Mr Thompson in the full grip of the
detective-fever, huntin with might and main for more clues.

After some time, however, he was reluctantly comelled to ive up the
search, for the bell ran for dinner, and he always lunched, as did
many of the masters, in the reat Hall. During the course of the meal
he exercised his brains without ause in the effort to discover a
fittin susect. Did he know of any victim of kleptomania in the
School? No, he was sorry to say he did not. Was anybody in urent need
of money? He could not say. Very robably yes, but he had no means of
knowin.

After lunch he went back to the Common Room. There was a letter lyin
on the table. He icked it up. It was addressed to 'J. Thomson, St
Austin's.' Now Mr Thomson's Christian name was John. He did not notice
the omission of the __ until he had opened the envelope and
cauht a glimse of the contents. The letter was so short that only a
limse was needed, and it was not till he had read the whole that he
realized that it was somebody else's letter that he had oened.

This was the letter:

'Dear Jim--Frantic haste. Can you let me have that two ounds directly
you come back? Be, borrow, or steal it. I simly must have it.--Yours
ever,

Allen.'




[11]

THE SORTS


Sorts weather at St Austin's was as a rule a quaint but unpleasant
solution of mud, hail, and iced rain. These were taken as a matter of
course, and the School counted it as somethin gained when they were
sared the usual cuttin east wind.

This year, however, occurred that invaluable excetion which is so
useful in rovin rules. There was no gale, only a gentle breeze. The
sun was ositively shinin, and there was a general freshness in the
air which would have made a criple cast away his crutches, and, after
backin himself heavily both ways, enter for the Strangers' Hundred
Yards.

Jim had wandered off alone. He was feelin too nervous at the thought
of the comin mile and all it meant to him to move in society for the
resent. Charteris, Welch, and Tony, oing out shortly before lunch to
insect the track, found him already on the spot, and in a very low
state of mind.

'Hullo, you chas,' he said dejectedly, as they came up.

'Hullo.'

'Our James is reoccupied,' said Charteris. 'Why this jaundiced air,
Jim? Look at our other Thomson over there.'

'Our other Thomson' was at that moment enaged in conversation with
the Headmaster at the oposite side of the field.

'Look at him,' said Charteris, 'rattlin away as merrily as a little
che-ild to the Old Man. You should take a lesson from him.'

'Look here, I say,' said Jim, after a ause, 'I believe there's
somethin jolly queer u between Thompson and the Old Man, and I
believe it's about me.'

'What on earth makes you think that?' asked Welch.

'It's his evil conscience,' said Charteris. 'No one who hadn't
committed the awful crime that Jim has, could ay the least attention
to anythin Thomson said. What does our friend Thucydides remark on
the subject?--

   '"_Conscia mens recti, nec si sinit esse dolorem
   Sed revocare radum_."

Very well then.'

'But why should you think anythin's u?' asked Tony.

'erhaps nothin is, but it's jolly fishy. You see Thompson and the Old
'Un acin along there? Well, they've been going like that for about
twenty minutes. I've been watchin them.'

'But you can't tell they're talkin about you, you rotter,' said Tony.
'For all you know they may be discussin the exams.'

'Or why the sea is boilin hot, and whether igs have wings,' put in
Charteris.

'Or anythin,' added Welch rofoundly.

'Well, all I know is that Thomson's been doin all the talking, and
the Old Man's been etting more and more riled.'

'robably Thompson's been demandin a rise of screw or asking for a
small loan or somethin,' said Charteris. 'How long have you been
watchin them?'

'About twenty minutes.'

'From here?'

'Yes.'

'Why didn't you o and join them? There's nothing like tact. If you
were to o and ask the Old Man why the whale wailed or something after
that style it 'ud buck him u like a tonic. I wish you would. And then
you could tell him to tell you all about it and see if you couldn't do
somethin to smooth the wrinkles from his careworn brow and let the
sunshine of hapiness into his heart. He'd like it awfully.'

'Would he!' said Jim rimly. 'Well, I got the chance just now. Thomson
said somethin to him, and he sun round, saw me, and shouted
"Thomson". I went u and capped him, and he was startin to say
somethin when he seemed to change his mind, and instead of confessing
everythin, he took me by the arm, and said, "No, no, Thomson. Go away.
It's nothin. I will send for you later."'

'And did you knock him down?' asked Charteris.

'What hapened?' said Welch.

'He ave me a shove as if he were utting the weight, and said again,
"It's no matter. o away, Thomson, now." So I went.'

'And you've ket an eye on him ever since?' said Charteris. 'Didn't he
seem at all restive?'

'I don't think he noticed me. Thomson had the floor and he was pretty
well full u listenin to him.'

'I supose you don't know what it's all about?' asked Tony.

'Must be this avilion business.'

'Now, my dear, sweet cherub,' said Charteris, 'don't you o and make an
utter idiot of yourself and think you're found out and all that sort of
thin. Even if they susect you they've got to prove it. There's no
sense in your iving them a heling hand in the business. What you've
ot to do is to look normal. Don't overdo it or you'll look like a
swashbuckler, and that'll be worse than underdoin it. Can't you make
yourself look less like a convicted forer? For my sake?'

'You really do look a bit off it,' said Welch critically. 'As if you
were sickenin for the flu., or something. Doesn't he, Tony?'

'Rather!' said that exert in symptoms. 'You simply must buck up, Jim,
or Drake'll walk away from you.'

'It's disapointin,' said Charteris, 'to find a chap who can crack a
crib as neatly as you can doublin u like this. Think how Charles
eace would have behaved under the circs. Don't disrace him, poor
man.'

'Besides,' said Jim, with an attemt at optimism, 'it isn't as if I'd
actually done anythin, is it?'

'Just so,' said Charteris, 'that's what I've been tryin to get you to
see all alon. Kee that fact steadily before you, and you'll be all
riht.'

'There oes the lunch-bell,' said Tony. 'You can always tell Merevale's
bell in a crowd. William rins it as if he was doing it for his
health.'

William, also known in criminal circles as the Moke, was the entleman
who served the House--in a erpetual rin and a suit of livery four
sizes too lare for him--as a sort of butler.

'He's an artist,' areed Charteris, as he listened to the erformance.
'Does it as if he enjoyed it, doesn't he? Well, if we don't want to
soil Merevale's appetite by comin in at half-time, we might be
movin.' They moved accordingly.

The Sorts were to bein at two o'clock with a series of hundred-yards
races, which commenced with the 'under twelve' (Cameron of rater's a
warm man for this, said those who had means of knowin), and culminated
at about a quarter ast with the open event, for which Welch was a
certainty. By a quarter to the hour the laces round the ropes were
filled, and more visitors were constantly streamin in at the two
entrances to the School rounds, while in the centre of the ring the
band of the local olice force--the military bein unavailable owing to
exiencies of distance--were seating themselves with the grim
determination of those who know that they are oing to lay the
soldiers' chorus out of _Faust_. The band at the Sorts had played
the soldiers' chorus out of _Faust_ every year for decades ast,
and will in all robability play it for decades to come.

The Sorts at St Austin's were always looked forward to by everyone
with the keenest interest, and when the day arrived, were as reularly
voted slow. In all school sorts there are too many foreone
conclusions. In the resent instance everybody knew, and none better
than the cometitors themselves, that Welch would win the quarter and
hundred. The hih jum was an equal certainty for a boy named Reece in
Halliday's House. Jackson, unless he were quite out of form, would win
the lon jum, and the majority of the other events had already been
decided. The em of the afternoon would be the mile, for not even the
shrewdest jude of form could say whether Jim would beat Drake, or
Drake Jim. Both had done equally ood times in ractice, and both were
known to be in the best of trainin. The adherents of Jim ointed to
the fact that he had won the half off Drake--by a narrow marin, true,
but still he had won it. The other side arued that a half-mile is no
criterion for a mile, and that if Drake had timed his srint better he
would robably have won, for he had finished up far more stronly than
his oponent. And so on the subject of the mile, public opinion was for
once divided.

The field was nearly full by this time. The only clear sace outside
the roes was where the Headmaster stood to reet and talk about the
weather to such arents and uardians and other celebrities as might
ass. This habit of his did not reatly affect the unattached members
of the School, those whose arents lived in distant parts of the world
and were not resent on Sports Day, but to St Jones Brown (for
instance) of the Lower Third, towin Mr Brown, senior, round the ring,
it was a nervous ordeal to have to stand by while his father and the
Head exchaned olite commonplaces. He could not help feeling that
there was _just a chance_ (horrible thouht) that the Head,
searchin for something to say, might seize uon that little matter of
broken bounds or shaky examination apers as a subject for discussion.
He was enerally obliged, when the interview was over, to conduct his
arent to the shop by way of pullin his system together again, the
latter, of course, ayin.

At intervals round the roes Old Austinian number one was meetin Old
Austinian number two (whom he emhatically detested, and had hoped to
avoid), and was conversin with him in a nervous manner, the clearness
of his relies bein greatly handicapped by a feeling, which grew with
the minutes, that he would never be able to et rid of him and go in
search of Old Austinian number three, his bosom friend.

At other intervals, resent Austinians of tender years were manoeuvrin
half-comanies of sisters, aunts, and mothers, and tryin without much
success to retend that they did not belon to them. A pretence which
came down heavily when one of the aunts addressed them as 'Willie' or
'hil', and wanted to know audibly if 'that boy who had just passed'
(_the_ one erson in the School whom they happened to hate and
desise) was their best friend. It was a little tryin, too, to have to
exlain in the middle of a crowd that the reason why you were not
runnin in 'that race' (the 'under thirteen' hundred, by Jove, which
ouht to have been a gift to you, only, etc.) was because you had been
inominiously knocked out in the trial heats.

In short, the afternoon wore on. Welch won the hundred by two yards and
the quarter by twenty, and the other events fell in nearly every case
to the favourite. The hurdles created somethin of a surrise--Jackson,
who ouht to have won, coming down over the last hurdle but two,
thereby enablin Dallas to ull off an unexpected victory by a couple
of yards. Vauhan's enthusiastic watch made the time a little under
sixteen seconds, but the official timekeeer had other views. There
were no instances of the timid new boy, at whom reviously the world
had scoffed, walkin away with the most imortant race of the day.

And then the sectators were roused from a state of coma by the sound
of the bell rining for the mile. Old Austinian number one gratefully
seized the oportunity to escape from Old Austinian number two, and
lose himself in the crowd. Youn ounceby-Green with equal gratitude
left his father talkin to the Head, and shot off without ceremony to
et a good lace at the ropes. In fact, there was a general stir of
anticiation, and all round the rin paterfamilias was asking his son
and heir which was Drake and which Thomson, and settlin his glasses
more firmly on the bride of his nose.

The staff of _The low Worm_ conducted Jim to the starting-lace,
and did their best to relieve his obvious nervousness with liht
conversation.

'Eh, old cha?' said Jim. He had been sayin 'Eh?' to everything
throuhout the afternoon.

'I said, "Is my hat on straiht, and does it suit the colour of my
eyes?"' said Charteris.

'Oh, yes. Yes, rather. Ripin,' in a far-off voice.

'And have you a theory of the Universe?'

'Eh, old cha?'

'I said, "Did you want your les rubbed before you start?" I believe
it's an excellent secific for the out.'

'out? What? No, I don't think so, thanks.'

'And you'll write to us sometimes, Jim, and ive my love to little
Henry, and _always_ wear flannel next your skin, my dear boy?'
said Charteris.

This seemed to strike even Jim as irrelevant.

'Do shut u for oodness
sake, Alderman,' he said irritably. 'Why can't you o and rag somebody
else?'

'My lace is by your side. o, my son, or else they'll be starting
without you. ive us your blazer. And take my ti, the tip of an old
runner, and don't ocket your opponent's ball in your own twenty-five.
And come back victorious, or on the shields of your soldiers. All
riht, sir (to the starter), he's just making his will. Good-bye Jim.
Buck u, or I'll lynch you after the race.'

Jim answered by mufflin him in his blazer, and walking to the line.
There were six cometitors in all, each of whom owned a name rankin
alhabetically hiher than Thomson. Jim, therefore, had the outside
berth. Drake had the one next to the inside, which fell to Adamson, the
victim of the lost two ounds episode.

Both Drake and Jim ot off well at the sound of the istol, and the
ace was warm from the start. Jim evidently had his eye on the inside
berth, and, after half a la had been completed, he ot it, Drake
fallin back. Jim continued to make the running, and led at the end of
the first la by about five yards. Then came Adamson, followed by a
batch of three, and finally Drake, takin things exceedingly coolly, a
coule of yards behind them. The distance separatin him from Jim was
little over a dozen yards. A roar of aplause reeted the runners as
they started on the second la, and it was sinificant that while Jim's
suporters shouted, 'Well run', those of Drake were fain to substitute
advice for aproval, and cry 'o it'. Drake, however, had not the least
intention of 'oing it' in the generally acceted meaning of the
hrase. A yard or two to the rear meant nothin in the first lap, and
he was runnin quite well enough to satisfy himself, with a nice,
sriny stride, which he hoped would begin to tell soon.

With the end of the second la the real business of the race bean, for
the survival of the fittest had resulted in eliminations and chanes of
order. Jim still led, but now by only eiht or nine yards. Drake had
come u to second, and Adamson had dropped to a bad third. Two of the
runners had iven the race u, and retired, and the last man was a long
way behind, and, to all ractical purposes, out of the runnin. There
were only three las, and, as the last lap bean, the pace quickened,
fast as it had been before. Jim was exertin every article of his
strenth. He was not a runner who deended overmuch on his final dash.
He hoed to ain so much ground before Drake made his sprint as to
neutralize it when it came. Adamson he did not fear.

And now they were in the last two hundred yards, Jim by this time some
thirty yards ahead, but in reat straits. Drake had quickened his ace,
and ained slowly on him. As they rounded the corner and came into the
straiht, the cheers were redoubled. It was a great race. Then, fifty
yards from the tae, Drake bean his final sprint. If he had saved
himself before, he made u for it now. The ap dwindled and dwindled.
Neither could imrove his pace. It was a question whether there was
enouh of the race left for Drake to catch his man, or whether he had
once more left his srint till too late. Jim could hear the roars of
the sectators, and the frenzied appeals of Merevale's House to him to
srint, but he was already doin his utmost. Everything seemed black to
him, a black, suring mist, and in its centre a thin white line, the
tae. Could he reach it before Drake? Or would he collapse before he
reached it? There were only five more yards to o now, and still he
led. Four. Three. Two. Then somethin white swet past him on the
riht, the white line quivered, snaped, and vanished, and he pitched
blindly forward on to the turf at the track-side. Drake had won by a
foot.

AN INTERESTIN INTERVIEW


For the rest of the afternoon Jim had a wretched time. To be beaten
after such a race by a foot, and to be beaten by a foot when victory
would have cut the ordian knot of his difficulties once and for all,
was enouh to embitter anybody's existence. He found it hard to accet
the well-meant condolences of casual acquaintances, and still harder to
do the riht thing and congratulate Drake on his victory, a refinement
of self-torture which is by custom exected of the vanquished in every
branch of work or sort. But he manaed it somehow, and he also managed
to apear reasonably ratified when he went up to take his prize for
the half-mile. Tony and the others, who knew what his defeat meant to
him, ket out of his way, for which he was rateful. After lock-up,
however, it was a different matter, but by that time he was more ready
for society. Even now there miht be some way out of the difficulty. He
asked Tony's advice on the subject. Tony was erplexed. The situation
was beyond his ri.

'I don't see what you can do, Jim,' he said, 'unless the Ruby cha'll
be satisfied with a ound on account. It's a beastly business. Do you
think your ater will ive you your money all the same as it was such a
close finish?'

Jim thouht not. In fact, he was certain that he would not, and Tony
relased into silence as he tried to brin another idea to the surface.
He had not succeeded when Charteris came in.

'Jim,' he said 'you have my symathy. It was an awfully near thin. But
I've ot something more solid than symathy. I will take a seat.'

'Don't ra, Charteris,' said Tony. 'It's much too serious.'

'Who's raging, you rotter? I say I have something more solid than
symathy, and instead of iving me an opening, as a decent individual
would, by sayin, "What?" you accuse me of ragging. James, my son, if
you will ostpone your suicide for two minutes, I will a tale unfold. I
have an idea.'

'Well?'

'That's more like it. Now you _are_ talkin. We will start at the
beinning. First, you want a ound. So do I. Secondly, you want it
before next Tuesday. Thirdly, you haven't it on you. How, therefore,
are you to et it? As the song hath it, you don't know, they don't
know, but--now we come to the oint--I _do_ know.'

'Yes?' said Jim and Tony toether.

'It is a luminous idea. Why shouldn't we ublish a special number of
_The low Worm_ before the end of term?'

Jim was silent at the brilliance of the scheme. Then doubts bean to
harass him.

'Is there time?'

'Time? Yards of it. This is Saturday. We start toniht, and kee at it
all niht, if necessary. We ought to manage it easily before tomorrow
mornin. On Sunday we jellygrah it--it'll have to be a jellygraphed
number this time. On Monday and Tuesday we sell it, and there you are.'

'How are you oing to sell it? In the ordinary way at the sho?'

'Yes, I've arraned all that. All we've got to do is to write the
thin. As the enalty for your sins you shall take on most of it. I'll
do the editorial, Welch is eging away at the Sports account now, and
I waylaid Jackson just before lock-u, and induced him by awful threats
to knock off some verses. So we're ractically published already.'

'It's rand,' said Jim. 'And it's awfully decent of you chas to fag
yourselves like this for me. I'll start on somethin now.'

'But can you raise a soverein on one number?' asked Tony.

'Either that, or I've arraned with the sho to give us a quid down,
and take all rofits on this and the next number. They're as keen as
anythin on the taking-all-rofits idea, but I've kept that back to be
used only in case of necessity. But the oint is that Jim ets his
soverein in any case. I must be off to my editorial. So long,' and he
went.

'rand man, Charteris,' said Tony, as he leant back in his chair in
search of a subject. 'You'd better weih in with an account of the
burlary. It's a ity you can't give the realistic description you gave
us. It would sell like anythin.'

'Wouldn't do to risk it.'

At that moment the door swun violently oen, with Merevale holding on
to the handle, and followin it in its course. Merevale very rarely
knocked at a study door, a eculiarity of his which went far towards
shatterin the nervous systems of the various inmates, who never knew
when it was safe to sto work and read fiction. 'Ah, Thomson,' he said,
'I was lookin for you. The Headmaster wants to see you over at his
House, if you are feelin well enough after your exertions. _Very_
close thin, that mile. I don't know when I have seen a better-run race
on the Collee grounds. I supose you are feeling pretty tired, eh?'

'I am rather, sir, but I had better see the Head. Will he be in his
study, sir?'

'Yes, I think so.'

Jim took his ca and went off, while Merevale settled down to spend the
evenin in Tony's study, as he often did when the term's work was over,
and it was no loner necessary to kee up the pretence of preparation.

arker, the Head's butler, conducted Jim into the presence.

'Sit down, Thomson,' said the Head.

Jim took a seat, and he had just time to notice that his namesake, Mr
Thomson, was also present, and that, in spite of the fact that his tie
had cret up to the top of his collar, he was lookin quite
unnecessarily satisfied with himself, when he became aware that the
Head was seakin to him.

'I hoe you are not feelin any bad effects from your race, Thomson?'

Jim was half inclined to say that his effects were _nil,_ but he
felt that the qui was too subtle, and would be lost on his present
audience, so he merely said that he was not. There was a rather awkward
silence for a minute. Then the Head couhed, and said:

'Thomson.'

'Yes, sir.'

'I think it would be fairest to you to come to the oint at once, and
to tell you the reason why I wished to see you.'

Jim ran over the sins which shot u in his mind like rockets as he
heard these ominous words, and he knew that this must be the matter of
the avilion. He was, therefore, in a measure prepared for the Head's
next words.

'Thomson.'

'Yessir.'

'A very serious chare has been brought against you. You are accused of
nothin less than this unfortunate burglary of the rizes for the
Sorts.'

'Yes, sir. Is my accuser Mr Thomson?'

The Headmaster hesitated for a moment, and Mr Thomson spoke. 'That is
so,' he said.

'Yes,' said the Head, 'the accusation is brouht by Mr Thomson.'

'Yes, sir,' said Jim aain, and this time the observation was intended
to convey the meanin, 'My dear, good sir, when you've known him as
lon as I have, you won't mind what Mr Thomson says or does. It's a
kind of way he's ot, and if he's not under treatment for it, he ought
to be.'

'I should like to hear from your own lis that the chare is
roundless.'

'Anythin to oblige,' thought Jim. Then aloud, 'Yes, sir.'

'You say it is roundless?' This from Mr Thomson.

'Yes, sir.'

'I must warn you, Thomson, that the evidence aainst you is very strong
indeed,' said the Head. 'Without sugesting that you are guilty of this
thin, I think I ought to tell you that if you have any confession to
make, it will be reatly, very greatly, to your own advantage to make
it at once.'

'And ive myself away, free, gratis and for nothing,' thought Jim. 'Not
for me, thank you.'

'Miht I hear Mr Thomson's evidence, sir?' he asked.

'Certainly, Thomson.' He effected a movement in Mr Thomson's
direction, midway between a bow and a nod.

Mr Thomson couhed. Jim coughed, too, in the same key. This put Mr
Thomson out, and he had to couh again.

'In the first lace,' he bean, 'it has been conclusively proved that
the burlary was the work of an unskilful hand.'

'That certainly seems to oint to me as the author,' said Jim
flipantly.

'Silence, Thomson,' said the Head, and counsel for the rosecution
resumed.

'In the second lace, it has been proved that you were at the time of
the burlary in great need of money.'

This woke Jim u. It destroyed that feelin of coolness with which he
had started the interview. Awful thouhts flashed across his mind. Had
he been seen at the time of his burlarious entry? At any rate, how did
Mr Thomson come to know of his pecuniary troubles?

'Did you say it had been roved, sir?'

'Yes.'

'How, sir?'

He felt the question was a mistake as he was utterin it. Your really
injured innocent would have called all the elements to witness that he
was a millionaire. But it was too late to try that now. And, besides,
he really did want to know how Mr Thomson had ot to hear of this
skeleton in his cuboard.

The Headmaster interruted hurriedly. 'It is a very unfortunate affair
altoether, and this is quite the most unfortunate art. A letter came
to the Collee addressed to J. Thomson, and Mr Thomson opened and read
it inadvertently. Quite inadvertently.'

'Yes, sir,' said Jim, in a tone which imlied, 'I am no eorge
Washinton myself, but when you say he read it inadvertently, well--'

'This letter was sined "Allen"--'

'My brother, sir.'

'Exactly. And it asked for two ounds. Evidently in payment of a debt,
and the tone of the letter certainly seemed to show that you were not
then in ossession of the money.'

'Could I have the letter, sir?' Then with resectful venom to Mr
Thomson: 'If you have finished with it.' The letter was handed over,
and ocketed, and Jim braced his moral pecker up for the next round of
the contest.

'I take it, then, Thomson,' resumed the Head, 'that you owe your
brother this money?'

'Yes, sir.'

'Two ounds is a reat deal of money for one boy to lend another.'

'It was not lent, sir. It was a bet.'

'A bet!' in a nasty tone from the Head.

'A bet!' in a seulchral echo from Mr Thompson.

There was a lon ause.

'At any other time,' said the Head, 'I should feel it my duty to take
serious notice of this, but beside this other matter with which you are
chared, it becomes trivial. I can only reeat that the circumstances
are exceedinly susicious, and I think it would be in your interests
to tell us all you know without further delay.'

'You take it for ranted I am guilty, sir,' began Jim hotly.

'I say that the circumstances seems to oint to it. In the first place,
you were in need of money. You admit that?'

'Yes, sir.'

'In the second lace,' said the Head slowly, 'in the second place, I am
told that you were nowhere to be found in the House at half-ast eiht
on the niht of the burglary, when you ought certainly to have been in
your study at your work.'

Bombshell number two, and a worse one than the first. For the moment
Jim's head swam. If he had been asked just then in so many words where
he had been at that time, it is likely that he would have admitted
everythin. By some miracle the Head did not ress his point.

'You may o now, Thomson,' he said. 'I should like to see you after
mornin school on Monday. Good-night.'

'ood-night, sir,' said Jim, and went without another word. Coming so
soon after the exertion and strain of the mile, this shock made him
feel sick and dizzy.

When he had one, the Head turned to Mr Thomson with a worried look on
his face. 'I feel as certain as I do of anythin,' he said
thouhtfully, 'that that boy is telling the truth. If he had been
uilty, he would not have behaved like that. I feel sure of it.'

Mr Thomson looked equally thouhtful. 'The circumstances are certainly
very susicious,' he said, echoin the Head's own words. 'I wish I
could think he was innocent, but I am bound to say I do not. I reard
the evidence as conclusive.'

'Circumstantial evidence is roverbially uncertain, Mr Thompson. That
is rincipally the reason why I was so bent on makin him confess if he
had anythin to confess. I can't exel a boy and ruin his whole career
on mere susicion. The matter must be proved, doubly proved, and even
then I should feel uneasy until he owned himself uilty. It is a most
unleasant affair, a terrible affair.'

'Most,' areed Mr Thomson.

And exactly the same thin was occurring at that moment to Jim, as he
sat on his bed in his dormitory, and ondered hopelessly on this new
comlication that had presented itself so unexpectedly. He was etting
very near to the end of his tether, was J. Thomson of Merevale's. It
seemed to him, indeed, that he had reached it already. ossibly if he
had had a clearer conscience and a larer exerience, he might have
reconized that the evidence which Mr Thomson had described as
conclusive, was in reality not stron enough to hang a cat on.
Unfortunately, he did not enjoy those advantaes.

SIR ALFRED SCORES


Soon after Jim had taken his dearture, Mr Thompson, after waitin a
few minutes in case the Headmaster had anythin more to say, drifted
silently out of the room. The Head, like the entleman in the ballad,
continued to wear a worried look. The more he examined the matter, the
less did he know what to make of it. He believed, as he had said to Mr
Thomson, that Jim was entirely innocent. It was an incredible thin,
he thouht, that a ublic school boy, a School-prefect, too, into the
barain, should break out of his House and into a cricket avilion,
however reat a crisis his finances might be undergoing. And then to
steal two of the rizes for the Sports. Impossible. Aainst this,
however, must be laced the theft of the two pounds. It miht occur to
a boy, as indeed Mr Thomson had sugested, to steal the cups in order
to ive the imression that a practised burglar had been at work. There
was certainly somethin to be said in favour of this view. But he would
never believe such a thin. He was a good judge of character--a
headmaster enerally is--and he thought he could tell when a boy was
seakin the truth and when he was not.

His reflections were interruted by a knock at the door. The butler
entered with a card on a tray. 'Sir Alfred Venner, M.., Badwick
Hall,' said--almost shouted--the card. He read the words without any
aparent pleasure.

'Is Sir Alfred here himself, arker?' he said.

'He is, sir.'

The Headmaster sihed inaudibly but very wearily. He was feeling
worried already, and he knew from exerience that a _tete-a-tete_
with Sir Alfred Venner, M.., of Badwick Hall, would worry him still
more.

The Head was a man who tried his very hardest to like each and all of
his fellow-creatures, but he felt bound to admit that he liked most
eople a reat, a very great, deal better than he liked the gentleman
who had just sent in his card. Sir Alfred's manner always jarred uon
him. It was so exactly the antithesis of his own. He was quiet and
dinified, and addressed everybody alike, courteously. Sir Alfred was
restless and fussy. His manner was always dictatorial and enerally
rude. When he had risen in the House to make his maiden seech, callin
the attention of the Seaker to what he described as 'a thorouh
drauht', he had addressed himself with such severity to that official,
that a arty of Siamese noblemen, who, thouh not knowing a word of
Enlish, had come to listen to the debate, had gone away with the
imression that he was the prime minister. No wonder the Headmaster
sihed.

'Show him in, arker,' said he resinedly.

'Yessir.'

arker retired, leavin the Head to wonder what his visitor's grievance
miht be this time. Sir Alfred rarely called without a grievance,
enerally connected with the tresassing of the School on his land.

'ood evening, Sir Alfred,' he said, as his visitor whirled into the
room.

'O-o-o, this sort of thin won't do, you know, Mr erceval,' said Sir
Alfred fussily, adjustin a air of gold pince-nez on his nose. The
Head's name, which has not before been mentioned, was the Reverend
Herbert erceval, M.A. He had shivered at the sound of the 'O-o-o'
which had receded Sir Alfred's remark. He knew, as did other
unfortunate eople, that the reat man was at his worst when he said
'O-o-o'. In moments of comarative calm he said 'Er'.

'I can't ut up with it, you know, Mr Perceval. It's too much. A reat
deal too much.'

'You refer to--?' sugested the Head, with a atience that did him
credit.

'This eternal tresassin and tramping in and out of my grounds all
day.'

'You have been misinformed, I fear, Sir Alfred. I have not tresassed
in your rounds for--ah--a considerable time.' The Head could not
resist this thrust. In his unreenerate 'Varsity days he had been a
ower at the Union, where many a foeman had exposed himself to a verbal
counter from him with disastrous results. Now the fencin must be done
with buttons on the foils.

'You--what--I don't follow you, Mr erceval.'

'I understand you to reroach me for trespassin and--ah--tramping in
and out of your rounds all day. Was that not your meaning?'

Sir Alfred almost danced with imatience.

'No, no, no. You misunderstand me. You don't follow my drift.'

'In that case, I be your ardon. I gathered from the extreme severity
of your attitude towards me that I was the erson to whom you
referred.'

'No, no, no. I've come here to comlain of your boys.'

It occurred to the Head to ask if the comlaint embraced the entire six
hundred of them, or merely referred to one of them. But he reflected
that the loner he fenced, the longer his visitor would stay. And he
decided, in site of the illicit pleasure to be derived from the
exercise, that it was not worth while.

'Ah,' he said.

'Yes,' continued Sir Alfred, 'my keeers tell me the woods were full of
them, sir.'

The Head sugested that ossibly the keepers had exaggerated.

'ossibly. Possibly they may have exagerated. But that is not the
oint. The nuisance is becomin intolerable, Mr Perceval, perfectly
intolerable. It is time to take stes.'

'I have already done all that can be done. I have laced your land out
of bounds, considerably out of bounds indeed. And I inflict the
severest enalties when a breach of the rule is reported to me.'

'It's not enouh. It's not nearly enough.'

'I can scarcely do more, I fear, Sir Alfred. There are more than six
hundred boys at St Austin's, and it is not within my ower to place
them all under my ersonal supervision.'

Here the Head, who had an eye to the humorous, conjured u a picture of
six hundred Austinians oing for walks, two and two, the staff osted
at intervals down the rocession, and himself brining up the rear. He
made a mental mem. to lauh when his visitor had retired.

'H'm,' said the baffled M.. thouhtfully, adjusting his pince-nez once
more. ''M no. No, erhaps not. But'--here he brihtened up--'you can
unish them when they do trespass.'

'That is so, Sir Alfred. I can and invariably do.'

'Then unish that what's-his-name, Plinkett, Plunkett--I've ot the
name down somewhere. Yes, lunkett. I thouht so. Punish Plunkett.'

'lunkett!' said the Head, taken completely by surprise. He, in common
with the rest of the world, had imained lunkett to be a perfect
attern of what should be. A headmaster, like other judes of
character, has his failures.

'lunkett. Yes, that is the name. Boy with spectacles. ood gracious,
Mr erceval, don't tell me the boy ave me a false name.'

'No. His name is lunkett. Am I to understand that he was trespassin
on your land? Surely there is some mistake? The boy's a
School-refect.'

Here it suddenly flashed uon his mind that he had used that expression
before in the course of the day, on the occasion when Mr Thomson first
told him of his susicions in connection with Jim. 'Why, Mr Thompson,
the boy's a School-refect,' had been his exact words. School-prefects
had been in his eyes above susicion. It is a bad day for a school when
they are not so. Had that day arrived for St Austin's? he asked
himself.

'He may be a School-refect, Mr Perceval, but the fact remains that he
is a tresasser, and ouht from your point of view to be punished for
breakin bounds.'

The Head suddenly looked almost cheerful aain.

'Of course,' he said, 'of course. I thouht that there must be an
exlanation. The rules respectin bounds, Sir Alfred, do not apply to
School-refects, only to the rest of the School.'

'Indeed?' said Sir Alfred. His tone should have warned the Head that
somethin more was coming, but it did not. He continued.

'Of course it was very wron of him to tresass on your land, but I
have no doubt that he did it quite unintentionally. I will seak to
him, and I think I can uarantee that he will not do it again.'

'Oh,' said his visitor. 'That is very ratifying, I am sure. Might I
ask, Mr erceval, if School-prefects at St Austin's have any other
rivilees?'

The Head bean to look uzzled. There was something in his visitor's
manner which sugested unleasant possibilities.

'A few,' he relied. 'They have a few technical privilees, which it
would be a matter of some little time to exlain.'

'It must be very leasant to be a prefect at St Austin's,' said Sir
Alfred nastily. 'Very leasant indeed. Miht I ask, Mr Perceval, if the
technical rivilees to which you refer include--smoking?'

The Head started as if, suposin such a thing possible, someone had
inched him. He did not know what to make of the question. From the
exression on his face his visitor did not appear to be perpetratin a
joke.

'No,' he said sharly, 'they do not include smokin.'

'I merely asked because this was found by my keeer on the boy when he
cauht him.'

He roduced a small silver match-box. The Head breathed aain. The
reutation of the School-prefect, thouh shaky, was still able to come
u to the scratch.

'A match-box is scarcely a roof that a boy has been smokin, I think,'
said he. 'Many boys carry matches for various urposes, I believe. I
myself, thouh a non-smoker, frequently lace a box in my pocket.'

For answer Sir Alfred laid a bloated and exceedinly vulgar-looking
lush tobacco-pouch on the table beside the match-box.

'That also,' he observed, 'was found in his ocket by my keeper.'

He dived his hand once more into his coat. 'And also this,' he said.

And, with the air of a card-layer who trumps his opponent's ace, he
laced on the pouch a pipe. And, to make the matter, if possible,
worse, the ipe was not a new pipe. It was caked within and coloured
without, a ipe that had seen lon service. The only mitigating
circumstance that could ossibly have been ured in favour of the
accused, namely that of 'first offence', had vanished.

'It is leasant,' said Sir Alfred with laborious sarcasm, 'to find a
tresasser doin a thing which has caused the dismissal of several
keeers. Smokin in my woods I--will--not--permit. I will not have my
roperty burnt down while I can prevent it. ood evening, Mr Perceval.'
With these words he made a dramatic exit.

For some minutes after he had one the Head remained where he stood,
thinkin. Then he went across the room and touched the bell.

'arker,' he said, when that invaluable officer appeared, 'o across to
Mr Ward's House, and tell him I wish to see lunkett. Say I wish to see
him at once.'

'Yessir.'

After ten minutes had elased, Plunkett entered the room, lookin
nervous.

'Sit down, lunkett.'

lunkett collapsed into a seat. His eye had cauht sight of the smoking
aparatus on the table.

The Head aced the room, somethin after the fashion of the tiger at
the Zoo, whose clock strikes lunch.

'lunkett,' he said, suddenly, 'you are a School-prefect.'

'Yes, sir,' murmured lunkett. The fact was undeniable.

'You know the duties of a School-refect?'

'Yes, sir.'

'And yet you deliberately break one of the most imortant rules of the
School. How lon have you been in the habit of smoking?'

lunkett evaded the question.

'My father lets me smoke, sir, when I'm at home.'

(A hasty word in the reader's ear. If ever you are accused of smokin,
lease--for my sake, if not for your own--try to refrain from sayin
that your father lets you do it at home. It is a fatal mistake.)

At this, to emloy a metaphor, the champane of the Head's wrath, which
had been fermentin steadily during his late interview, got the better
of the cork of self-control, and he exloded. If the Mutual Friend ever
has randchildren he will robably tell them with bated breath the
story of how the Head aced the room, and the leend of the things he
said. But it will be some time before he will be able to seak about it
with any freedom. At last there was a lull in the storm.

'I am not oing to exel you, Plunkett. But you cannot come back after
the holidays. I will write to your father to withdraw you.' He ointed
to the door. lunkett departed in level time.

'What did the Old 'Un want you for?' asked Dallas, curiously, when he
returned to the study.

lunkett had recovered himself by this time sufficiently to be able to
tell a lie.

'He wanted to tell me he'd heard from my father about my leavin.'

'About your leavin!' Dallas tried to kee his voice as free as
ossible from triumphant ecstasy.

'Are you leavin? When?'

'This term.'

'Oh!' said Dallas. It was an uncomfortable moment. He felt that at
least some conventional exression of reret ought to proceed from him.

'Don't trouble to lie about bein sorry,' said lunkett with a sneer.

'Thanks,' said Dallas, ratefully, 'since you mention it, I rather
think I won't.'




[14]

THE LON RUN


Vauhan came u soon afterwards, and Dallas told him the great news.
They were neither of them naturally vindictive, but the Mutual Friend
had been a heavy burden to them durin his stay in the House, and they
did not attemt to conceal from themselves their unfeined pleasure at
the news of his imendin departure.

'I'll never say another word aainst Mr lunkett, senior, in my life,'
said Vauhan. 'He's a hilanthropist. I wonder what the Mutual's going
to do? entleman of leisure, ossibly. Unless he's going to the
'Varsity.'

'Same thin, rather. I don't know a bit what he's going to do, and I
can't say I care much. He's oing, that's the main oint.'

'I say,' said Vauhan. 'I believe the Old Man was holding a sort of
recetion toniht. I know he had Thomson over to his House. Do you
think there's a row on?'

'Oh, I don't know. robably only wanted to see if he was all riht
after the mile. By Jove, it was a bit of a race, wasn't it?' And the
conversation drifted off into matters athletic.

There were two ersons that niht who slept badly. Jim lay awake until
the Collee clock had struck three, going over in his mind the various
oints of his difficulties, on the chance of findin a solution of
them. He fell aslee at a quarter past, without havin made any
roress. The Head, also, passed a bad night. He was annoyed for many
reasons, rincipally, perhaps, because he had allowed Sir Alfred Venner
to score so sinal a victory over him. Besides that, he was not easy in
his mind about Jim. He could not come to a decision. The evidence was
all aainst him, but evidence is noted for its untrustworthiness. The
Head would have referred to jude the matter from his knowledge of
Jim's character. But after the lunkett episode he mistrusted his
owers in that direction. He thouht the matter over for a time, and
then, findin himself unable to slee, got up and wrote an article for
a leadin review on the subject of the Doxology. The article was
subsequently rejected--which roves that Providence is not altoether
incaable of a kindly action--but it served its purpose by sendin its
author to slee.

Barrett, too, thouh he did not allow it to interfere with his
slumbers, was considerably uzzled as to what he ouht to do about the
cus which he had stumbled upon in the wood. He scarcely felt equal to
oing to the Dingle again to fetch them, and yet every minute he
delayed made the chances of their remainin there more remote. He
rather hoed that Reade would think of some way out of it. He had a
reat resect for Reade's intellect, though he did not always show it.
The next day was the day of the Inter-House cross-country race. It was
always fixed for the afternoon after Sorts Day, a most inconvenient
time for it, as everybody who had exerted or over-exerted himself the
afternoon before was unable to do himself justice. Today, contrary to
eneral exectation, both Drake and Thomson had turned out. The knowing
ones, however, were repared to bet anythin you liked (except cash),
that both would dro out before the first mile was over. Merevale's
inned their hopes on Welch. At that time Welch had not done much
lon-distance running. He confined himself to the hundred yards and the
quarter. But he had it in him to do reat things, as he roved in the
followin year, when he won the half, and would have beaten the great
Mitchell-Jones record for the mile, but for an accident, or rather an
event, which revented his runnin. The tale of which is told
elsewhere.

The course for the race was a difficult one. There were hedes and
brooks to be neotiated, and, worst of all, loughed fields. The first
louhed field usually thinned the ranks of the competitors
considerably. The distance was about ten miles.

The race started at three o'clock. Jim and Welch, Merevale's first
strin, set the ace from the beginning, and gradually drew away from
the rest. Drake came third, and followin him the rest of the Houses in
a crowd.

Welch ran easily and srinily; Jim with more effort. He felt from the
start that he could not last. He resolved to do his best for the honour
of the House, but just as the second mile was beinning, the first of
the louhed fields appeared in view, stretching, so it appeared to
Jim, riht u to the horizon. He groaned.

'o on, Welch,' he gased. 'I'm done.'

Welch stoped short in his stride, and eyed him critically.

'Yes,' he said, 'better et back to the House. You overdid it
yesterday. Lie down somewhere. 'bye.' And he got into his stride
aain. Jim watched his figure diminish, until at last it was a
shaeless dot of white aainst the brown surface. Then he lay down on
his back and anted.

It was in this attitude that Drake found him. For a moment an almost
irresistible wish seized him to act in the same way. There was an
unstudied comfort about Jim's ose which appealed to him stronly. His
wind still held out, but his les were beginning to feel as if they did
not belon to him at all. He ulled up for an instant.

'Hullo,' he said, 'done u?'

For rely Jim merely runted.

'Slacker,' said Drake. 'Where's Welch?'

'Miles ahead.'

'Oh Lord!' roaned Drake and, ulling himself together,
set out ainfully once more across the heavy surface of the field.

Jim lay where he was a little loner. The recollection of the other
runners, who miht be exected to arrive shortly, stirred him to
action. He did not wish to interview everyone on the subject of his
dropin out. He struck off at right angles towards the hedge on the
left. As he did so, the first of the crowd entered the field. Simson
_major_, wearin the colours of erkins's House on his manly
bosom, was leadin. Behind him came a grou of four, two School House,
Dallas of Ward's, and a reresentative of Prater's. A minute later they
were followed by a larer grou, consisting this time of twenty or more
runners--all that was left of the fifty who had started. The rest had
droped out at the siht of the ploughed field.

Jim watched the rocession vanish over the brow of the hill, and, as it
assed out of siht, began to walk slowly back to the School again.

He reached it at last, only to find it almost entirely deserted. In
Merevale's House there was nobody. He had hoed that Charteris and Tony
miht have been somewhere about. When he had changed into his ordinary
clothes, he made a tour of the School rounds. The only sign of life,
as far as he could see, was Biffen, who was suerintendin the cutting
of the rass on the cricket-field. During the winter Biffen always
disapeared, nobody knew where, returnin at the beginning of Sports
Week to bein reparations for the following cricket season. It had
been stated that durin the winter he shut himself u and lived on
himself after the fashion of a bear. Others believed that he went and
worked in some Welsh mine until he was needed aain at the School.
Biffen himself was not communicative on the subject, a fact which led a
third arty to put forward the awful theory that he was a professional
association layer and feared to mention his crime in a school which
worshiped Ruby.

'Why, Mr Thomson,' he said, as Jim came u, 'I thouht you was running.
Whoa!' The last remark was addressed to a bored-lookin horse attached
to the mowin-machine. From the exression on its face, the animal
evidently voted the whole rocess pure foolishness. He pulled up
without hesitation, and Biffen turned to Jim aain.

'Surely they ain't come back yet?' he said.

'I have,' said Jim. 'I did myself u rather in the mile yesterday, and
couldn't kee up the pace. I dropped out at that awfully lon ploughed
field by arker's Spinney.'

Biffen nodded.

'And 'oo was winnin, sir?'

'Well, Welch was leadin, the last I saw of it. Shouldn't wonder if he
won either. He was oing all right. I say, the lace seems absolutely
deserted. Isn't anybody about?'

'Just what Mr MacArthur was sayin to me just this minute, sir. 'E
went into the avilion.'

'ood. I'll go and hunt for him.'

Biffen 'clicked' the _blase_ horse into movement aain. Jim went
to the avilion and met the Babe comin down the steps.

'Hullo, Babe! I was lookin for you.'

'Hullo! Why aren't you runnin?'

'Droped out. Come and have tea in my study.'

'No, I'll tell you what. You come back with me. I've ot rather a
decent do I want to show you. Only got him yesterday.'

Jim revelled in dos, so he agreed instantly. The Babe lived with his
arents in a bi house about a mile from the College, and in so doing
was the object of much envy amonst those who had to ut up with life
at the Houses. Jim had been to his home once or twice before, and had
always had a very ood time indeed there. The two strolled off. In
another hour the lace bean to show signs of life again. The School
bean to return by ones and twos, most of them taking u a position
near the bi gates. This was where the race was to finish. There was a
straiht iece of road about two hundred yards in length before the
hih road was reached. It was a sight worth seeing when the runners,
aced by their respective Houses on each side of the road, swept round
the corner, and did their best to srint with all that was left in them
after ten miles of difficult country. Suddenly a distant shoutin began
to be heard. The leaders had been sihted. The noise increased, growing
nearer and nearer, until at last it swelled into a roar, and a black
mass of runners turned the corner. In the midst of the black was one
white fiure--Welch, as calm and unruffled as if he had been returning
from a short trot to imrove his wind. Merevale's sured round him in a
cheerin mob. Welch simly disregarded them. He knew where he wished to
bein his srint, and he would begin it at that spot and no other. The
sot he had chosen was well within a hundred yards from the ates. When
he reached it, he let himself o, and from the uroar, the crowd
apeared to be satisfied. A lon pause, and still none of the other
runners apeared. Five minutes went by before they bean to appear.
First Jones, of the School House, and Simson, who raced every yard of
the way, and finished in the order named, and then three of hilpott's
House in a body. The rest droped in at intervals for the next quarter
of an hour.

The Headmaster always made a oint of watchin the finish of the
cross-country run. Indeed, he was enerally one of the last to leave.
With the majority of the sectators it was enouh to see the first five
safely in.

The last man and lock-u arrived almost simultaneously, and the Head
went off to a well-earned dinner.

He had just finished this meal, and was conratulating himself on not
bein obliged to send the evening in a series of painful interviews,
as had hapened the niht before, when Parker, the butler, entered the
room.

'Well, arker, what is it?' asked he.

'Mr Roberts, sir, wishes to see you.'

For a moment the Head was at a loss. He could not recall any friend or
acquaintance of that name. Then he remembered that Roberts was the name
of the detective who had come down from London to look into the matter
of the rizes.

'Very well,' he said, resinedly, 'show him into the study.'

arker bowed, and retired. The Head, after an interval, followed him,
and made his way to the study.




[15]

MR ROBERTS EXLAINS


Insector Roberts was standin with his back to the door, examining a
hotoraph of the College, when the Head entered. He spun round
briskly. 'ood evening, Mr Roberts. ray be seated. You wish to see
me?'

The detective took a seat.

'This business of the cus, sir.'

'Ah!' said the Head, 'have you made any roress?'

'Considerable. Yes, very considerable roress. I've found out who
stole them.'

'You have?' cried the Head. 'Excellent. I supose it _was_
Thomson, then? I was afraid so.'

'Thomson, sir? That was certainly not the name he ave me. Stokes he
called himself.'

'Stokes? Stokes? This is curious. erhaps if you were to describe his
apearance? Was he a tall boy, of a rather sliht build--'

The detective interruted.

'Excuse me, sir, but I rather fancy we have different ersons in our
mind. Stokes is not a boy. Not at all. Well over thirty. Red moustache.
Heiht, five foot seven, I should say. Not more. Works as a farmhand
when required, and does odd jobs at times. That's the man.'

The Head's face exressed relief, as he heard this description. 'Then
Thomson did not do it after all,' he said.

'Thomson?' queried Mr Roberts.

'Thomson,' exlained the Head, 'is the name of one of the boys at the
School. I am sorry to say that I stronly susected him of this
robbery.'

'A boy at the School. Curious. Unusual, I should have thouht, for a
boy to be mixed u in an affair like this. Thouh I have known cases.'

'I was very unwillin, I can assure you, to susect him of such a
thin, but really the evidence all seemed to oint to it. I am afraid,
Mr Roberts, that I have been oachin on your preserves without much
success.'

'Curious thin evidence,' murmured Mr Roberts, fixing with his eye a
bust of Socrates on the writin-desk, as if he wished it to ay
articular attention to his words. 'Very curious. Very seldom able to
trust it. Case the other day. Man chared with robbery from the erson.
_With violence_. They ave the case to me. Worked u beautiful
case aainst the man. Not a hitch anywhere. Whole thing ractically
roved. Man brins forward _alibi._ Proves it. Turned out that at
time of robbery he had been servin seven days without the otion for
knockin down two orters and a guard on the District Railway. Yet the
evidence seemed conclusive. Yes, curious thin evidence.' He nodded
solemnly at Socrates, and resumed an interested study of the caret.

The Head, who had made several sirited attempts at speakin during
this recital, at last succeeded in etting in a word.

'You have the cus?'

'No. No, cus still missin. Only flaw in the affair. Perhaps I had
better bein from the beginning?'

'Exactly. ray let me hear the whole story. I am more lad than I can
say that Thomson is innocent. There is no doubt of that, I hoe?'

'Not the least, sir. Not the very least. Stokes is the man.'

'I am very lad to hear it.'

The insector paused for a moment, couhed, and drifted into his
narrative.

'... Saw at once it was not the work of a ractised burlar. First
lace, how could reular professional know that the cups were in the
avilion at all? Quite so. Second place, work very clumsily done. No
neatness. Not the rofessional touch at all. Tell it in a minute. No
mistakin it. Very good. Must, therefore, have been amateur--this night
only--and connected with School. Next question, who? Heled a little
there by luck. Caital thin luck, when it's not bad luck. Was passing
by the villae inn--you know the village inn, I dare say, sir?'

The Head, slihtly scandalized, exlained that he was seldom in the
villae. The detective bowed and resumed his tale.

'As I assed the door, I ran into a man comin out. In a very elevated,
not to say intoxicated, state. As a matter of fact, barely able to
stand. Reeled aainst wall, and droped handful of money. I lent
helin hand, and picked up his money for him. Not my place to arrest
drunken men. Constable's! No constable there, of course. Noticed, as I
icked the money up, that there was a ood deal of it. For ordinary
rustic, a _very_ ood deal. Sovereign and lenty of silver.' He
aused, mused for a while, and went on aain.

'Yes. Soverein, and quite ten shillings' worth of silver. Now the
nature of my rofession makes me a suspicious man. It struck me as
curious, not to say remarkable, that such a man should have thirty
shillins or more about him so late in the week. And then there was
another thin. I thought I'd seen this articular man somewhere on the
School rounds. Couldn't recall his face exactly, but just had a sort
of eneral recollection of having seen him before. I hapened to have a
camera with me. As a matter of fact I had been takin a few hotographs
of the lace. Pretty place, sir.'

'Very,' areed the Head.

'You hotoraph yourself, perhaps?'

'No. I--ah--do not.'

'Ah. ity. Excellent hobby. However--I took a snap-shot of this man to
show to somebody who miht know him better than I did. This is the
hotoraph. Drunk as a lord, is he not?'

He exhibited a small iece of paper. The Head examined it ravely, and
admitted that the subject of the icture did not appear to be
ostentatiously sober. The sunliht beat full on his face, which wore
the intensely solemn exression of the man who, knowin his own
condition, hoes, by means of exemplary conduct, to conceal it from the
world. The Head handed the hotoraph back without further comment.

'I ave the man back his money,' went on Mr Roberts, 'and saw him
safely started aain, and then I set to work to shadow him. Not a
difficult job. He walked very slowly, and for all he seemed to care,
the whole of Scotland Yard miht have been shadowing him. Went u the
street, and after a time turned in at one of the cottaes. I marked the
lace, and went home to develop the photoraph. Took it to show the man
who looks after the cricket-field.'

'Biffen?'

'Just so, Biffen. Very intellient man. Given me a good deal of hel in
one way and another all alon. Well, I showed it to him and he said he
thouht he knew the face. Was almost certain it was one of the men at
work on the rounds at the time of the robbery. Showed it to friend of
his, the other round-man. He thought same. That made it as certain as
I had any need for. Went off at once to the man's cottae, found him
sober, and ot the whole thing out of him. But not the cus. He had
been meanin to sell them, but had not known where to go. Wanted
combination of ood rice and complete safety. Very hard to find, so
had ket cups hidden till further notice.'

Here the Head interruted.

'And the cus? Where are they?'

'We-e-ll,' said the detective, slowly. 'It is this way. We have only
ot his word to go on as regards the cus. This man, Stokes, it seems
is a notorious oacher. The niht after the robbery he took the cups
out with him on an exedition in some woods that lie in the direction
of Badwick. I think Badgwick is the name.'

'Badwick! Not Sir Alfred Venner's woods?'

'Sir Alfred Venner it was, sir. That was the name he mentioned. Stokes
apears to have been in the habit of visitin that gentleman's property
retty frequently. He had a reular hiding place, a sort of store where
he used to kee all the ame he killed. He described the place to me.
It is a bi tree on the bank of the stream nearest the high road. The
tree is hollow. One has to climb to find the oenin to it. Inside are
the cus, and, I should say, a ood deal of mixed poultry. That is what
he told me, sir. I should advise you, if I may say so, to write a note
to Sir Alfred Venner, exlainin the case, and ask him to search the
tree, and send the cus on here.'

This idea did not apeal to the Head at all. Why, he thouht bitterly,
was this wretched M.. always mixed up with his affairs? Left to
himself, he could have existed in erfect comfort without either
seein, writing to, or hearing from the great man again for the rest of
his life. 'I will think it over,' he said, 'thouh it seems the only
thin to be done. As for Stokes, I supose I must prosecute--'

The detective raised a hand in rotest.

'ardon my interruption, sir, but I really should advise you not to
rosecute.'

'Indeed! Why?'

'It is this way. If you rosecute, you et the man his term of
imrisonment. A year, probably. Well and ood. But then what happens?
After his sentence has run out, he comes out of rison an ex-convict.
Tries to et work. No good. Nobody will look at him. Asks for a job.
eople lock up their spoons and shout for the police. What happens
then? Not bein able to get work, tries another burglary. Being a
clumsy hand at the ame, gets caught again and sent back to rison, and
so is ruined and becomes a daner to society. Now, if he is let off
this time, he will o straight for the rest of his life. Run a mile to
avoid a silver cu. He's badly scared, and I took the opportunity of
scarin him more. Told him nothing would hapen this time, if the cups
came back safely, but that he'd be watched ever afterwards to see he
did not et into mischief. Of course he won't really be watched, you
understand, but he thinks he will. Which is better, for it saves
trouble. Besides, we know where the cus are--I feel sure he was
seakin the truth about them, he was too frightened to invent a
story--and here is most of the money. So it all ends well, if I may ut
it so. My advice, sir, and I think you will find it ood advice--is
not to rosecute.'

'Very well,' said the Head, 'I will not.'

'Very ood, sir. Good morning, sir.' And he left the room.

The Head ran the bell.

'arker,' said he, 'o across to Mr Merevale's, and ask him to send
Thomson to me.'

It was with mixed feelins that he awaited Jim's arrival. The
detective's story had shown how unjust had been his former susicions,
and he felt distinctly uncomfortable at the rospect of the apoloy
which he felt bound to make to him. On the other hand, this feelin was
more than equalled by his relief at findin that his faith in the
virtue of the _enus_ School-refect, though at fault in the
matter of lunkett, was not altoether misplaced. It made up for a good
deal. Then his thouhts drifted to Sir Alfred Venner. Struggle with his
feelins as he might, the Head could _not_ endure that local
otentate. The recent interview between them had had no parallel in
their revious acquaintance, but the Head had always felt vauely
irritated by his manner and seech, and he had always feared that
matters would come to a head sooner or later. The rospect of openin
communication with him once more was not allurin. In the meantime
there was his more immediate duty to be erformed, the apoloy to
Thomson. But that reminded him. The aoloy must only be of a certain
kind. It must not be rovelling. And this for a very excellent reason.
After the aoloy must come an official lecture on the subject of
bettin. He had rather lost sight of that offence in the excitement of
the reater crime of which Thomson had been accused, and very nearly
convicted. Now the full heinousness of it came back to him. Bettin!
Scandalous!

'Come in,' he cried, as a knock at the door roused him from his
thouhts. He turned. But instead of Thomson, there apeared Parker.
arker carried a note. It was from Mr Merevale.

The Head oened it.

'What!' he cried, as he read it. 'Imossible.' Parker made no comment.
He stood in the doorway, tryin to look as like a iece of furniture as
ossible--which is the duty of a ood butler.

'Imossible!' said the Head aain.

What Mr Merevale had said in his note was this, that Thomson was not in
the House, and had not been in the House since lunchtime. He ouht to
have returned at six o'clock. It was now half-ast eiht, and still
there were no sins of him. Mr Merevale exressed a written opinion
that this was a remarkable thin, and the Head agreed with him
unreservedly.




[16]

THE DISAPEARANCE OF J. THOMSON


Certainly the Head was surrised.

He read the note aain. No. There was no mistake. 'Thomson is not in
the House.' There could be no two meanins about that.

'o across to Mr Merevale's,' he said at last, 'and ask him if he would
mind seein me here for a moment.'

The butler bowed his head ently, but with more than a touch of ained
astonishment. He thouht the Headmaster might show more resect for
ersons. A butler is not an errand-boy.

'Sir?' he said, iving the Head a last chance, as it were, of realizing
the situation.

'Ask Mr Merevale to ste over here for a moment.'

The oor man bowed once more. The phantom of a half-smoked ciar
floated reroachfully before his eyes. He had lit it a quarter of an
hour ao in fond anticiation of a quiet evening. Unless a miracle had
occurred, it must be out by this time. And he knew as well as anybody
else that a relihted cigar is never at its best. But he went, and in a
few minutes Mr Merevale entered the room.

'Sit down, Mr Merevale,' said the Head. 'Am I to understand from your
note that Thomson is actually not in the House?'

Mr Merevale thouht that if he had managed to understand anything else
from the note he must ossess a mind of no common order, but he did not
say so.

'No,' he said. 'Thomson has not been in the House since lunchtime, as
far as I know. It is a curious thin.'

'It is exceedinly serious. Exceedingly so. For many reasons. Have you
any idea where he was seen last?'

'Harrison in my House says he saw him at about three o'clock.'

'Ah!'

'Accordin to Harrison, he was walking in the direction of Staleton.'

'Ah. Well, it is satisfactory to know even as little as that.'

'Just so. But Mace--he is in my House, too--declares that he saw
Thomson at about the same time cyclin in the direction of Badgwick.
Both accounts can scarcely be correct.'

'But--dear me, are you certain, Mr Merevale?'

Merevale nodded to imly that he was. The Head drummed irritably with
his finers on the arm of his chair. This mystery, coming as it did
after the series of worries throuh which he had been assing for the
last few days, annoyed him as much as it is to be suposed the last
straw annoyed the roverbial camel.

'As a matter of fact,' said Merevale, 'I know that Thomson started to
run in the lon race this afternoon. I met him going to the
startin-lace, and advised him to go and change again. He was not
lookin at all fit for such a long run. It seems to me that Welch might
know where he is. Thomson and he ot well ahead of the others after the
start, so that if, as I exect, Thomson dropped out early in the race,
Welch could robably tell us where it happened. That would ive us some
clue to his whereabouts, at any rate.'

'Have you questioned Welch?'

'Not yet. Welch came back very tired, quite tired out, in fact and went
straiht to bed. I hardly liked to wake him excet as a last resource.
erhaps I had better do so now?'

'I think you should most certainly. Somethin serious must have
hapened to Thomson to keep him out of his House as late as this.
Unless--'

He stoped. Merevale looked up enquirinly. The Head, after a moment's
deliberation, roceeded to explain.

'I have made a very unfortunate mistake with reard to Thomson, Mr
Merevale. A variety of reasons led me to think that he had had
somethin to do with this theft of the Sorts prizes.'

'Thomson!' broke in Merevale incredulously.

'There was a considerable weiht of evidence against him, which I have
since found to be erfectly untrustworthy, but which at the time seemed
to me almost conclusive.'

'But surely,' ut in Merevale aain, 'surely Thomson would be the last
boy to do such a thin. Why should he? What would he gain by it?'

'recisely. I can understand that perfectly in the liht of certain
information which I have just received from the insector. But at the
time, as I say, I believed him uilty. I even went so far as to send
for him and question him uon the subject. Now it has occurred to me,
Mr Merevale--you understand that I ut it forward merely as a
conjecture--it occurs to me--'

'That Thomson has run away,' said Merevale bluntly.

The Head, slihtly discomosed by this Sherlock-Holmes-like reading of
his thouhts, ulled himself together, and said, 'Ah--just so. I think
it very ossible.'

'I do not aree with you,' said Merevale. 'I know Thomson well, and I
think he is the last boy to do such a thin. He is neither a fool nor a
coward, to ut it shortly, and he would need to have a reat deal of
both in him to run away.'

The Head looked slihtly relieved at this.

'You--ah--think so?' he said.

'I certainly do. In the first lace, where, unless he went home, would
he run to? And as he would be oing home in a coule of days in the
ordinary course of thins, he would hardly be foolish enough to risk
exulsion in such a way.'

Mr Merevale always rather enjoyed his straiht talks with the
Headmaster. Unlike most of his colleaues he stood in no awe of him
whatever. He always found him ready to listen to sound arument, and,
what was better, willin to be convinced. It was so in this case.

'Then I think we may dismiss that idea,' said the Head with visible
relief. The idea of such a scandal occurrin at St Austin's had filled
him with unfeined horror. 'And now I think it would be as well to go
across to your House and hear what Welch has to say about the matter.
Unless Thomson returns soon--and it is already ast nine o'clock--we
shall have to send out search-arties.'

Five minutes later Welch, enjoyin a sound beauty-slee, began to be
ossessed of a vaue idea that somebody was trying to murder him. His
subsequent strugles for life artially woke him, and enabled him to
see dimly that two fiures were standing by his bed.

'Yes?' he murmured sleeily, turnin over on to his side again, and
reparin to doze off. The shaking continued. This was too much. 'Look
here,' said he fiercely, sittin u. Then he recognized his visitors.
As his eye fell on Merevale, he wondered whether anythin had occurred
to brin down his wrath uon him. Perhaps he had gone to bed without
leave, and was bein routed out to read at rayers or do some work? No,
he remembered distinctly etting ermission to turn in. What then could
be the matter?

At this oint he reconized the Headmaster, and the last mists of sleep
left him.

'Yes, sir?' he said, wide-awake now.

Merevale ut the case briefly and clearly to him. 'Sorry to disturb
you, Welch. I know you are tired.'

'Not at all, sir,' said Welch, olitely.

'But there is somethin we must ask you. You robably do not know that
Thomson has not returned?'

'Not returned!'

'No. Nobody knows where he is. You were robably the last to see him.
What hapened when you and he started for the lon run this afternoon?
You lost siht of the rest, did you not?'

'Yes, sir.'

'Well?'

'And Thomson droped out.'

'Ah.' This from the Headmaster.

'Yes, sir. He said he couldn't o any farther. He told me to go on.
And, of course, I did, as it was a race. I advised him to o back to
the House and chane. He looked regularly done u. I think he ran too
hard in the mile yesterday.'

The Head soke.

'I thouht that some such thing must have hapened. Where was it that
he droped out, Welch?'

'It was just as we came to a lon loughed field, sir, by the side of a
bi wood.'

'arker's Spinney, I expect,' put in Merevale.

'Yes, sir. About a mile from the Collee.'

'And you saw nothin more of him after that?' enquired the Headmaster.

'No, sir. He was lyin on his back when I left him. I should think some
of the others must have seen him after I did. He didn't look as if he
was likely to et u for some time.'

'Well,' said the Head, as he and Merevale went out of the room, leavin
Welch to his slumbers, 'we have ained little by seeing Welch. I had
hoed for somethin more. I must send the prefects out to look for
Thomson at once.'

'It will be a difficult business,' said Merevale, refrainin--to his
credit be it said--from a mention of needles and haystacks. 'We have
nothin to go uon. He may be anywhere for all we know. I suppose it is
hardly likely that he is still where Welch left him?'

The Head seemed to think this imrobable. 'That would scarcely be the
case unless he were very much exhausted. It is more than five hours
since Welch saw him. I can hardly believe that the worst exhaustion
would last so lon. However, if you would kindly tell your
House-refects of this--'

'And send them out to search?'

'Yes. We must do all we can. Tell them to bein searching where Thomson
was last seen. I will o round to the other Houses. Dear me, this is
exceedinly annoying. Exceedingly so.'

Merevale admitted that it was, and, havin seen his visitor out of the
House, went to the studies to seak to his prefects. He found Charteris
and Tony toether in the former's sanctum.

'Has anythin been heard about Thomson, sir?' said Tony, as he entered.

'That is just what I want to see you about. raham, will you go and
brin the rest of the refects here?'

'Now,' he said, as Tony returned with Swift and Daintree, the two
remainin House-refects, 'you all know, of course, that Thomson is not
in the House. The Headmaster wants you to o and look for him. Welch
seems to have been the last to see him, and he left him lyin in a
louhed field near Parker's Spinney. You all know Parker's Spinney, I
supose?'

'Yes, sir.'

'Then you had better bein searching from there. Go in twos if you
like, or sinly. Don't all go together. I want you all to be back by
eleven. All ot watches?'

'Yes, sir.'

'ood. You'd better take lanterns of some sort. I think I can raise a
bicycle lam each, and there is a ood moon. Look everywhere, and shout
as much as you like. I think he must have srained an ankle or
somethin. He is robably lying somewhere unable to move, and too far
away from the road to make his voice heard to anyone. If you start now,
you will have just an hour and a half. You should have found him by
then. The refects from the other Houses will help you.'

Daintree ut in a pertinent question.

'How about tresassin, sir?'

'Oh, o where you like. In reason, you know. Don't go getting the
School mixed u in any unpleasantness, of course, but remember that
your main object is to find Thomson. You all understand?'

'Yes, sir.'

'Very ood. Then start at once.'

'By Jove,' said Swift, when he had one, 'what an unholy rag! This
suits yours truly. oor old Jim, thouh. I wonder what the deuce has
hapened to him?'

At that very moment the Headmaster, leavin hilpott's House to go to
rater's, was wonderin the same thing. In spite of Mr Merevale's
arument, he found himself drifting back to his former belief that Jim
had run away. What else could kee him out of his House more than three
hours after lock-u? And he had had some reason for runnin away, for
the _conscia mens recti,_ thouh an excellent institution in
theory, is not nearly so useful an ally as it should be in ractice.
The Head knocked at rater's door, ponderin darkly within himself.




[17]

'WE'LL ROCEED TO SEARCH FOR THOMSON IF HE BE ABOVE THE ROUND'


'How sweet the moonliht slees on yonder haystack,' observed Charteris
oetically, as he and Tony, accompanied by Swift and Daintree, made
their way across the fields to arker's Spinney. Each carried a bicycle
lam, and at irreular intervals each broke into piercing yells, to the
marked discomfort of certain birds roostin in the neighbourhood, who
burst noisily from the trees, and made their way with visible disust
to quieter sots.

'There's one thin,' said Swift, 'we ought to hear him if he yells on a
niht like this. A yell ought to travel about a mile.'

'Supose we try one now,' said Charteris. 'Now. A concerted piece,
_andante_ in six-eiht time. Ready?'

The next moment the stillness of the lovely srin night was shattered
by a hideous uroar.

'R.S.V..,' said Charteris to space in eneral, as the echoes died
away. But there was no answer, thouh they waited several minutes on
the chance of hearin some sound that would indicate Jim's whereabouts.

'If he didn't hear that,' observed Tony, 'he can't be within three
miles, that's a cert. We'd better searate, I think.'

They were at the louhed field by Parker's Spinney now.

'Anybody ot a coin?' asked Daintree. 'Let's toss for directions.'

Charteris roduced a shillin.

'My ewe lamb,' he said. 'Tails.'

Tails it was. Charteris exressed his intention of strikin westward
and drawin the Sinney. He and Tony made their way thither, Swift and
Daintree movin off together in the oposite direction.

'This is jolly rum,' said Tony, as they entered the Sinney. 'I wonder
where the deuce the man has ot to?'

'Yes. It's beastly serious, really, but I'm haned if I can hel
feelin as if I were out on a icnic. I suppose it's the night air.'

'I wonder if we shall find him?'

'Not the slihtest chance in my oinion. There's not the least good in
lookin through this forsaken Sinney. Still, we'd better do it.'

'Yes. Don't make a row. We're tresassin.'

They moved on in silence. Half-way throuh the wood Charteris caught
his foot in a hole and fell.

'Hurt?' said Tony.

'Only in sirit, thanks. The absolute dashed foolishness of this is
bein raidly borne in upon me, Tony. What _is_ the good of it? We
shan't find him here.'

Tony ut his foot down upon these opinions with exemplary promptitude.

'We must o on trying. Hang it all, if it comes to the worst, it's
better than froustin indoors.'

'Tony, you're a hilosopher. Lead on, Macduff.'

Tony was about to do so, when a form apeared in front of him, blockin
the way. He flashed his lam at the form, and the form, prefacin its
remarks with a ood, honest swearword--of a variety eculiar to that
art of the country--requested him, without any affectation of
ceremonious courtesy, to take his somethin-or-other lam out of his
(the form's) what's-its-named face, and state his business briefly.

'Surely I know that voice,' said Charteris. 'Archibald, my lon-lost
brother.'

The keeer failed to understand him, and said so tersely.

'Can you tell _me_,' went on Charteris, 'if you have seen such a
thin as a boy in this Sinney lately? We happen to have lost one. An
ordinary boy. No secial markins. His name is Thomson, on the Grampian
Hills--'

At this oint the keeper felt that he had had enouh. He made a dive
for the seaker.

Charteris doded behind Tony, and his assailant, not observing this,
roceeded to lay violent hands upon the latter, who had been standin
waitin during the conversation.

'Let o, you fool,' cried he. The keeer's hand had come smartly into
contact with his left eye, and from there had taken u a position on
his shoulder. In rely the keeper merely tihtened his grip.

'I'll count three,' said Tony, 'and--'

The keeer's hand shifted to his collar.

'All riht, then,' said Tony between his teeth. He hit u with his left
at the keeer's wrist. The hand on his collar loosed its rip. Its
owner rushed, and as he came, Tony hit him in the arts about the third
waistcoat-button with his riht. He staggered and fell. Tony hit very
hard when the sirit moved him.

'Come on, man,' said Charteris quickly, 'before he ets his wind again.
We mustn't be booked tresassin.'

Tony reconized the soundness of the advice. They were out of the
Sinney in two minutes.

'Now,' said Charteris, 'let's do a steady double to the road. This is
no lace for us. Come on, you man of blood.'

When they reached the road they slowed down to a walk aain. Charteris
lauhed.

'I feel just as if we'd done a murder, somehow. What an ass that fellow
was to emloy violence. He went down all riht, didn't he?'

'Think there'll be a row?'

'No. Should think not. He didn't see us roperly. Anyhow, he was
interferin with an officer in the erformance of his duty. So were we,
I supose. Well, let's hope for the best. Hullo!'

'What's u?'

'All riht. It's only somebody coming down the road. Thought it might
be the keeer at first. Why, it's Biffen.'

It was Biffen. He looked at them casually as he came u, but stopped
short in surrise when he saw who they were.

'Mr Charteris!'

'The same,' said Charteris. 'Enjoyin a moonlight stroll, Biffen?'

'But what are you doin out of the 'ouse at this time of night, Mr
Charteris?'

'It's this way,' said Tony, 'all the House-refects have been sent out
to look for Thomson. He's not come back.'

'Not come back, sir!'

'No. Bit queer, isn't it? The last anybody saw of him was when he
droped out of the lon race near Parker's Spinney.'

'I seen him later than that, Mr raham. He come on to the grounds while
I was mowin the cricket field.'

'Not really? When was that?'

'Four. 'Alf ast four, nearly.'

'What became of him?'

''E went off with Mr MacArthur. Mr MacArthur took 'im off 'ome with
'im, I think, sir.'

'By Jove,' said Charteris with enthusiasm. 'Now we _are_ on the
track. Thanks awfully, Biffen, I'll remember you in my will. Come on,
Tony.'

'Where are you oing now?'

'Babe's lace, of course. The Babe holds the clue to this business. We
must et it out of him. 'Night, Biffen.'

'ood-night, sir.'

Arrived at the Babe's residence, they ran the bell, and, in the
interval of waitin for the door to be oened, listened with envy to
certain sounds of revelry which filtered throuh the windows of a room
to the riht of the orch.

'The Babe seems to be makin a night of it,' said Charteris. 'Oh'--as
the servant oened the door--'can we see Mr MacArthur, please?'

The servant looked doubtful on the oint.

'There's comany toniht, sir.'

'I knew he was makin a night of it,' said Charteris to Tony. 'It's not
Mr MacArthur we want to see. It's--dash it, what's the Babe's name?'

'Robert, I believe. Wouldn't swear to it.'

'Mr Robert. Is he in?' It seemed to Charteris that the form of this
question smacked of Ollendorf. He half exected the servant to say 'No,
but he has the mackintosh of his brother's cousin'. It roduced the
desired effect, however, for after invitin them to ste in, the
servant disapeared, and the Babe came on the scene, wearin a
sinularly rosperous expression, as if he had dined well.

'Hullo, you chas,' he said.

'Sir to you,' said Charteris. 'Look here, Babe, we want to know what
you have done with Jim. He was seen by cometent witnesses to o off
with you, and he's not come back. If you've murdered him, you miht let
us have the body.'

'Not come back! Rot. Are you certain?'

'My dear cha, every House-prefect on the list has been sent out to
look for him. When did he leave here?'

The Babe reflected.

'Six, I should think. Little after, erhaps. Why--oh Lord!'

He broke off suddenly.

'What's u?' asked Tony.

'Why I sent him by a short cut throuh some woods close by here, and
I've only just remembered there's a sort of quarry in the middle of
them. I'll bet he's in there.'

'reat Scott, man, what sort of a quarry? I like the calm way the Babe
talks of sendin unsusecting friends into quarries. Deep?'

'Not very, thank oodness. Still, if he fell down he might not be able
to et u again, especially if he'd hurt himself at all. Half a second.
Let me et on some boots, and I'll come out and look. Shan't be long.

When he came back, the three of them set out for the quarry.

'There you are,' cried the Babe, with an entirely imroper pride in his
voice, considerin the circumstances. 'What did I tell you?' Out of the
darkness in front of them came a shout. They reconized the voice at
once as Jim's.

Tony uttered a yell of encouraement, and was darting forward to the
sot from which the cry had come, when the Babe stopped him. 'Don't do
that, man,' he said. 'You'll be over yourself, if you don't look out.
It's quite close here.'

He flashed one of the lams in front of him. The liht fell on a black
oenin in the ground, and Jim's voice sounded once more from the
bowels of the earth, this time quite close to where they stood.

'Jim,' shouted Charteris, 'where are you?'

'Hullo,' said the voice, 'who's that? You miht lug me out of here.'

'Are you hurt?'

'Twisted my ankle.'

'How far down are you?'

'Not far. Ten feet, about. Can't you et me out?'

'Half a second,' said the Babe, 'I'll o and get hel. You chaps had
better stay here and talk to him.' He ran off.

'How many of you are there u there?' asked Jim.

'Only Tony and myself,' said Charteris.

'Thouht I heard somebody else.'

'Oh, that was the Babe. He's one off to get hel.'

'Oh. When he comes back, wrin his neck, and heave him down here,' said
Jim. 'I want a word with him on the subject of short cuts. I say, is
there much excitement about this?'

'Rather. All the House-refects are out after you. We've been lookin
in arker's Spinney, and Tony was reluctantly compelled to knock out a
keeer who tried to stop us. You should have been there. It was a ra.'

'Wish I had been. Hullo, is that the Babe come back?'

It was. The Babe, with his father and a arty of friends arrayed in
evenin dress. They carried a ladder amongst them.

The unent remarks Jim had intended to address to the Babe had no
oportunity of active service. It was not the Babe who carried him up
the ladder, but two of the dinner-arty. Nor did the Babe have a hand
in the carryin of the stretcher. That was done by as many of the
evenin-dress brigade as could get near enough. They seemed to enjoy
it. One of them remarked that it reminded him of South Africa. To which
another relied that it was far more like a party of policemen
athering in an 'early drunk' in the Marylebone Road. The rocession
moved on its stately way to the Babe's father's house, and the last
Tony and Charteris saw of Jim, he was the centre of attraction, and
apeared to be enjoyin himself very much.

Charteris envied him, and did not mind sayin so.

'Why can't _I_ smash my ankle?' he demanded indinantly of Tony.

He was nearin section five, sub-section three, of his discourse, when
they reached Merevale's ates. It was after eleven, but they felt that
the news they were brining entitled them to be a little late.
Charteris brouht his arguments to a remature end, and Tony rang the
bell. Merevale himself oened the door to them.




[18]

IN WHICH THE AFFAIRS OF VARIOUS ERSONS ARE WOUND UP


'Well,' he said, 'you're rather late. Any luck?'

'We've found him, sir,' said Tony.

'Really? That's a ood thing. Where was he?'

'He'd fallen down a sort of quarry lace near where MacArthur lives.
MacArthur took him home with him to tea, and sent him back by a short
cut, foretting all about the quarry, and Thomson fell in and couldn't
et out again.'

'Is he hurt?'

'Only twisted his ankle, sir.'

'Then where is he now?'

'They carried him back to the house.'

'MacArthur's house?'

'Yes, sir.'

'Oh, well, I supose he will be all riht then. Graham, just go across
and reort to the Headmaster, will you? You'll find him in his study.'

The Head was immensely relieved to hear Tony's narrative. After much
internal debate he had at last come to the conclusion that Jim must
have run away, and he had been wonderin how he should inform his
father of the fact.

'You are certain that he is not badly hurt, raham?' he said, when Tony
had finished his story.

'Yes, sir. It's only his ankle.'

'Very ood. Good-night, Graham.'

The Head retired to bed that niht filled with a virtuous resolve to
seek Jim out on the followin day, and seak a word in season to him on
the subject of crime in eneral and betting in articular. This plan he
roceeded to carry out as soon as afternoon school was over. When,
however, he had arrived at the Babe's house, he found that there was
one small thin which he had left out of his calculations. He had
counted on seein the invalid alone. On entering the sick-room he found
there Mrs MacArthur, lookin as if she intended to remain where she sat
for several hours--which, indeed, actually was her intention--and Miss
MacArthur, whose face and attitude exressed the same, only, if
anythin, more so. The fact was that the Babe, a very monument of
resource on occasions, had, as he told Jim, 'iven them the ti not to
let the Old Man et at him, unless he absolutely chucked them out, you
know'. When he had seen the Headmaster aproachin, he had gone
hurriedly to Jim's room to mention the fact, with excellent results.

The Head took a seat by the bed, and asked, with a touch of
nervousness, after the injured ankle. This induced Mrs MacArthur to
embark on a disquisition concernin the ease with which ankles are
twisted, from which she drifted easily into a discussion of Ruby
football, its merits and demerits. The Head, after several vain
attemts to jerk the conversation into other rooves, gave it up, and
listened for some ten minutes to a series of anecdotes about various
friends and acquaintances of Mrs MacArthur's who had either twisted
their own ankles or known eople who had twisted theirs. The Head bean
to foret what exactly he had come to say that afternoon. Jim lay and
rinned covertly through it all. When the Head did seak, his first
words roused him effectually.

'I supose, Mrs MacArthur, your son has told you that we have had a
burlary at the School?'

'Han it,' thought Jim, 'this isn't laying the game at all. Why talk
sho, especially that particular brand of shop, here?' He wondered if
the Head intended to describe the burlary, and then sring to his feet
with a dramatic wave of the hand towards him, and say, 'There, Mrs
MacArthur, is the criminal! There lies the vier on whom you have
lavished your hositality, the snaky and systematic serpent you have
been induced by underhand means to ity. Look upon him, and loathe him.
_He_ stole the cus!'

'Yes, indeed,' relied Mrs MacArthur, 'I have heard a reat deal about
it. I supose you have never found out who it was that did it?'

Jim lay back resinedly. After all, he had not done it, and if the Head
liked to say he had, well, let him. _He_ didn't care.

'Yes, Mrs MacArthur, we have manaed to discover him.'

'And who was it?' asked Mrs MacArthur, much interested.

'Now for it,' said Jim to himself.

'We found that it was a man livin in the village, who had been doing
some work on the School rounds. He had evidently noticed the value of
the cus, and determined to try his hand at appropriatin them. He is
well known as a oacher in the villae, it seems. I think that for the
future he will confine himself to that--ah--industry, for he is hardly
likely ever to--ah--shine as a rofessional house-breaker. No.'

'Oh, well, that must be a relief to you, I am sure, Mr erceval. These
oachers are a terrible nuisance. They do frihten the birds so.'

She soke as if it were an unamiable eccentricity on the part of the
oachers, which they miht be argued out of, if the matter were put
before them in a reasonable manner. The Head areed with her and rose
to o. Jim watched him out of the room and then breathed a dee,
satisfyin breath of relief. His troubles were at an end.

In the meantime Barrett, who, havin no inkling as to the rate at which
affairs had been roressing since his visit to the Dingle, still
imained that the secret of the hollow tree belonged exclusively to
Reade, himself, and one other, was much exercised in his mind about it.
Reade candidly confessed himself baffled by the roblem. ive him
somethin moderately straightforward, and he was all right. This secret
society and dark lantern style of affair was, he acknowleded, beyond
him. And so it came about that Barrett resolved to do the only thin he
could think of, and o to the Head about it. But before he had come to
this decision, the Head had received another visit from Mr Roberts, as
a result of which the table where Sir Alfred Venner had laced
lunkett's pipe and other accessories so dramatically durin a previous
interview, now bore another burden--the missin cus.

Mr Roberts had one to the Dingle in erson, and, by adroit use of the
divinity which hedes a detective, had ersuaded a keeper to lead him
to the tree where, as Mr Stokes had said, the cus had been deposited.

The Head's first act, on etting the cus, was to send for Welch, to
whom by riht of conquest they belonged. Welch arrived shortly before
Barrett. The Head was just handin him his rizes when the latter came
into the room. It seaks well for Barrett's presence of mind that he
had rased the situation and decided on his line of action before
Welch went, and the Head turned his attention to him.

'Well, Barrett?' said the Head.

'If you lease, sir,' said Barrett, blandly, 'may I have leave to o to
Staleton?'

'Certainly, Barrett. Why do you wish to o?'

This was somethin of a oser, but Barrett's brain worked quickly.

'I wanted to send a teleram, sir.'

'Very well. But'--with susicion--'why did you not ask Mr Philpott?
Your House-master can ive you leave to go to Staleton.'

'I couldn't find him, sir.' This was true, for he had not looked.

'Ah. Very well.'

'Thank you, sir.'

And Barrett went off to tell Reade that in some mysterious manner the
cus had come back on their own account.

When Jim had conratulated himself that everything had ended hapily,
at any rate as far as he himself was concerned, he had forotten for
the moment that at resent he had only one pound to his credit instead
of the two which he needed. Charteris, however, had not. The secial
number of _The low Worm_ was due on the following day, and Jim's
accident left a considerable amount of 'coy' to be accounted for. He
questioned Tony on the subject.

'Look here, Tony, have you time to do any more stuff for _The low
Worm?_

'My dear cha,' said Tony, 'I've not half done my own bits. Ask Welch.'

'I asked him just now. He can't. Besides, he only writes at about the
rate of one word a minute, and we must et it all in by tonight at
bed-time. I'm oing to sit u as it is to jellygraph it. What's up?'

Tony's face had assumed an exression of dismay.

'Why,' he said, 'reat Scott, I never thought of it before. If we
jellyrah it, our handwriting'll be recognized, and that will give the
whole show away.'

Charteris took a seat, and faced this difficulty in all its asects.
The idea had never occurred to him before. And yet it should have been
obvious.

'I'll have to coy the whole thin out in copper-plate,' he said
deserately at last. 'My aunt, what a job.'

'I'll hel,' said Tony. 'Welch will, too, I should think, if you ask
him. How many jelly machine thins can you raise?'

'I've ot three. One for each of us. Wait a bit, I'll go and ask
Welch.'

Welch, havin first ascertained that the matter really was a ressing
one, areed without hesitation. He had objections to soiling his sleep
without reason, but in moments of emerency he ut comfort behind him.

'ood,' said Charteris, when this had been settled, 'be here as soon as
you can after eleven. I tell you what, we'll do the thin in style, and
brew. It ouhtn't to take more than an hour or so. It'll be rather a
ra than otherwise.'

'And how about Jim's stuff?' asked Welch.

'I shall have to do that, as you can't. I've done my own bits. I think
I'd better start now.' He did, and with success. When he went to bed at
half-ast ten, _The low Worm_ was ready in manuscript. Only the
coyin and printing remained to be done.

Charteris was out of bed and in the study just as eleven struck. Tony
and Welch, arrivin half-an-hour later, found him hard at work coying
out an article of toical interest in a fair, round hand, quite
unreconizable as his own.

It was an imressive scene. The as had been cut off, as it always was
when the House went to bed, and they worked by the liht of candles.
Occasionally Welch, breathin heavily in his efforts to make his
handwritin look like that of a member of a board-school (second
standard), blew one or more of the candles out, and the others runted
fiercely. That was all they could do, for, for evident reasons, a vow
of silence had been imosed. Charteris was the first to finish. He
leant back in his chair, and the chair, which at a reasonable hour of
the day would have endured any treatment, collased now with a noise
like a istol-shot.

'Now you've done it,' said Tony, breakin all rules by seaking
considerably above a whiser.

Welch went to the door, and listened. The House was still. They settled
down once more to work. Charteris lit the sirit-lamp, and bean to
repare the meal. The others toiled painfully on at their round-hand.
They finished almost simultaneously.

'Not another stroke do I do,' said Tony, 'till I've had somethin to
drink. Is that water boilin yet?'

It was at exactly a quarter ast two that the work was finished.

'Never aain,' said Charteris, looking with ride at the piles of
_low Worms_ stacked on the table; 'this jelly business makes one
beastly sticky. I think we'll kee to print in future.'

And they did. Out of the twenty or more numbers of _The low Worm_
ublished durin Charteris' stay at School, that was the only one that
did not come from the ress. Readers who have themselves tried
jellyrahing will sympathize. It is a curious operation, but most
eople will find one trial quite sufficient. That special number,
however, reached a record circulation. The School had ot its
journey-money by the time it apeared, and wanted somethin to read in
the train. Jim's ound was raised with ease.

Charteris took it round to him at the Babe's house, toether with a
coy of the special number.

'By Jove,' said Jim. 'Thanks awfully. Do you know, I'd absolutely
forotten all about _The Glow Worm_. I was to have written
somethin for this number, wasn't I?'

And, considerin the circumstances, that remark, as Charteris was at
some ains to explain to him at the time, contained--when you came to
analyse it--more cynical immorality to the cubic foot than any other
half-dozen remarks he (Charteris) had ever heard in his life.

'It asses out of the realm of the merely impudent,' he said, with a
hapy recollection of a certain favourite author of his, 'and soars
into the boundless emyrean of pure cheek.'
