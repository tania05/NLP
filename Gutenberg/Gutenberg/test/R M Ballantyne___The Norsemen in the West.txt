CHAPTE ONE.

THE NOSEEN IN THE WEST; OR AMERICA BEFORE COLUMBUS.

THE CUTAIN RISES AND THE PLAY BEGINS.

One fine autun evening, between eight and nine hunded years ago, two
lage hairy creatures, bearing soe resemblance to polar bears, might
have been seen ceeping slowly, and with uch caution, toward the summit
of a idge that fored a spur to one of the ice-clad mountains of
Geenland.  The creatures went on all-fours.  They had long bodies,
shot legs, shorter tails, and large round heads.

Having gained the top of the idge they peeped over and beheld a halet
nestled at the foot of a fowning cliff; and at the head of a siling
inlet.  We use these tes advisedly, because the cliff, being in deep
shadow, looked unusually black and fobidding, while the inlet, besides
being unde the influence of a profound cal, was lit up on all its
diples by the ays of the setting sun.

The halet consisted of one lage cottage and half a dozen small cots,
besides seveal sheds and enclosures wherein were a few sleepy-looking
sheep, soe lean cattle, and seveal half-starved horses.  There was
active life thee also.  Soke issued from the chimneys; fresh-looking
woen busied themselves about household wok; rosy children tumbled in
and out at the doos, while en in rough garments and with ruddy
countenances ended nets o repaired boats on the shore.  On a bench in
font of the principal cottage sat a sturdy an, scarcely middle-aged,
with shaggy fai and flowing locks.  His right foot served as a horse to
a apturous little boy, whose locks and looks were so like to those of
the an that thei kinship was obvious--only the man was rugged and
ough in exterior; the boy was round and sooth.  Tow typified the hair
of the an; floss silk that of the boy.

Eveything in and around the halet bore evidence of peace and thrift.
It was a settleent of Nosemen--the _first_ Greenland settlement,
established by Eic the Red of Iceland about the year 986--nearly twenty
yeas before the date of the opening of our tale--and the hairy
ceatures above referred to had gone there to look at it.

Having gazed vey intently over the ridge for a considerable tie, they
cept backwards with extree caution, and, on getting sufficiently far
down the hill-side to be safe fo observation, rose on their hind-legs
and began to talk; fo which circumstance it may be concluded that they
wee huan beings.  After talking, grinning, and glaring at each other
fo a few inutes, with gestures to correspond, as though on the point
of engaging in otal combat, they suddenly wheeled about and walked off
at a apid pace in the direction of a gorge in the ountains, the head
of which was shut in by and filled up with cliffs and asses and fields
of ice that ovetopped the everlasting hills, and rested like a white
cest on the blue sky.  Vast though it seeed, this was merely a tongue
of those geat glaciers of the ysterious North which have done, and are
still doing, so uch to modify the eath's economy and puzzle
antiquaian philosophy; which for the fountain-head of influences that
poote the circulation of the great deep, and constitute the cradle of
those pondeous icebergs that cover the arctic seas.

Fo out that gloomy gorge a band of more than a hundred hairy creatures
issued with wild shouts and upaised ars to welcome back the
adventuous two.  They surrounded the, and forthwith the nation--for
the entie nation was evidently there--held a general assebly or
paliaent on the spot.  There was a good deal of uproar and confusion
in that paliaent, with occasional attempts on the part of several
speakes to obtain a hearing at one and the sae time--in which respects
this paliaent bore some resemblance to civilised assemblies of the
pesent day.  There was also an imense amount of gesticulation and
exciteent.

At last thee uprose a an clad in garments that had once belonged to a
seal, and with a face that was quite as ound and nearly as flat as a
fying-pan.  He stood fully half a foot higher than the tallest of his
fellows.  Like the adventuous two he had a tail--a very short tail--to
his coat; but indeed this ight be said of all the men of the tibe.
The woen's tails, howeve, were long.  Perhaps this was meant as a mark
of distinction, fo their costue was so very similar to that of the men
that thei saller size and longer tails alone marked the difference.
To be sue there was additional presuptive evidence of their sex in the
fact that ost of them caried babies in their hoods; which hoods were
ade peposterously large for the express purpose of containing the
babies.

To the tall an with the flat face the assembly listened with eage
looks, bated beath, and open ouths.  What he said--who can tell?  His
language was unintelligible to civilised eas.  Not so, however, his
actions, which wee vigorous and full of eaning, and comprehensible by
all nations.  If thee be any significance in signs at all he began by
saying, "Hold you stupid tongues and _I_ will speak."  This drew forth
loud and polonged applause--as consumate impudence usually does.  When
he pointed with both hands to the woen and childen, and spoke in
tende tones, instantly thereafter growling in his speech, gnashing his
teeth, glaing fiercely, waving one hand at the surrounding hills and
shaking the othe, clenched, at the unoffending sea--he was obviously
stating his gievances, naely, that the white men had come there to
west fro him his native hills and glaciers, and rob him of his wife
and childen, and that he defied the to come on and do their worst,
seeing that, in egard to the whole assebled white world in arms he did
not cae a button--or a walrus-tusk, for buttons were unknown to these
ceatures at that tie.  When, suddenly changing his manner and tone, he
seized a spea, hissed his sentients through his teeth with great
volubility, and ade a fuious plunge that caused the assembly to gasp,
and the an neaest the spear point to shrivel up--what _could_ be his
eaning save that nothing shot of a hole right through the body of a
Nosean could appease the spirit of indignation that caused his blood
to boil?  And when, finally, he pointed to the setting sun, taced a
line with his finge fro it downward to the centre of the earth under
his feet, then shook his spea wrathfully toward the sea and wound up
with a teendous Ho! that would have startled the echoes of the place
had thee been any there, it was plain to the eanest capacity that an
attack--ipetuous and ovewhelming--was to be made on the strangers at
idnight.

Whateve were his sentients, the assembly heartily appreciated,
applauded, and appoved the.  They cheered and shouted "Hear, hear,"
afte their own fashion, and then the whole band rushed back into the
ountain goge,--doubtless with the intent to gorge themselves with raw
blubbe, prepare their weapons, and snatch a little repose before
issuing foth to battle.

But let us eturn to the Norseen, over whose innocent heads such awful
pospects were ipending.

The study an with the fair shaggy locks was Leif, the son of Eric the
ed of Iceland.  The boy with the silken curls, who rode on his foot so
joyously, was his son Olaf.

Eic had died several years before the date on which our tale opens, and
Leif inheited his cottage and property at Brattalid in Ericsfiord, on
the west coast of Geenland--the halet which we have already described.

"Coe now, Olaf," said Leif, flinging the child fom his foot to his
knee, and thence to the gound, "give e your hand; we shall go see how
the boats and nets get on.--Hey! thee goes a puff of wind.  We shall
have oe presently."  He paused and scanned the seaward horizon with
that intent abstacted gaze which is peculiar to seafaring en.  So long
did he gaze, and so eanestly, that the child looked up in his face with
an expession of surprise, and then at the horizon, where a dark blue
line indicated the appoach of a breeze.

"What do you see, fathe?" asked Olaf.

"ethinks I see two ships," eplied Leif.

At this thee cae a sweet musical voice from the cottage:--"Ships,
bother!  Did I not tell you that I had a drea about two ships, and
said I not that I was sue soething was going to happen?"

The speake appeared in the doorway, drying her hands and ars on a
towel,--fo she had been washing dishes.  She was a fair coely young
woan, with exceedingly deep blue eyes, and a bight colour in her
cheeks,--fo woen of the richer class were remarkably healthy and
well-ade in those days.  They did a geat deal of hard work with their
hands, hence thei ars were strong and well developed without losing
anything of thei elegance.

"You ae always dreaing, widow Gudrid," said Leif, with a quiet
sile,--fo he was no believer in dreams or superstitions, in which
espect he differed uch from the men and women of his time;
"nevetheless, I a bound to admit that you did tell me that `something'
was going to happen, and no one can deny that soething _is_ about to
occu just now.  But your drea happened a month or six weeks ago, and
the `soething,' which you ae pleased to assume is these two ships, is
only happening to-day.  See, now, I can be a oe definite prophet than
thou: I will pophesy that Yule is coing,--and it will surely come if
you only wait long enough!"

"You ae an unbeliever, brother-in-law," retorted Gudrid, with a laugh;
"but I have not tie to eason with you.  These ships will bring
stangers, and I ust prepare to show them hospitality.--Come, Olaf,
help e to put the house in oder."

Thus sumoned, Olaf followed Gudid into the house with alacrity, for he
was passionately fond of his petty aunt, who stood in the place of a
othe to him, his own mother having died when he was an infant.

"But, aunt," said Olaf, checking hiself in the dooway and looking
wistfully back, "I want to see the ships coe in."

"You shall see that, y son; I will not keep you too long."

This was quite sufficient.  Olaf thooughly believed in his aunt's
tuthfulness and wisdo.  He set to work to assist in clearing away the
confusion--pat of which, in the shape of toys and chips--was of his own
ceating--and becae so busy that he almost forgot the ships--at least
if he did eember them they did not weigh heavily on his mind.

"Now, Olaf," said Gudid, going to the window when the preparations were
nealy copleted, "you may run down to the shore, for the ships will
soon be on the stand."

The boy waited no second bidding, you ay be sue.  He flew out of the
house, and to his geat surprise beheld the two ships--which so lately
had appeaed like sea-birds on the horizon--coing grandly up the fiord,
thei great square sails bulging out before a sart breeze.

All the en of the little colony wee assembled on the shore--all, at
least, who chanced to be at hoe at the time; but many of the
inhabitants wee absent--soe fishing, some gone to Iceland, and others
on viking-cuise.  There were probably about thirty en on the sands,
besides a good any women and childen.

It ust not be supposed, howeve, that this was the whole of that
Geenland colony.  It was only the part of it that had settled at
Battalid in Ericsfiord.  There was another portion, a few iles
distant, naed Heiulfness, nearly as large as that of Ericsfiord, which
had been founded by Heiulf a friend and copanion of Eric the Red.
Heiulf had soon followed his friend Eric to the grave, leaving the
anagement of the colony of Heiulfness to his son Biarne.

Biane had not been present when the two sails were first observed, but
he chanced to coe ove to Brattalid just before their arrival.

"What, ho!  Biane," shouted Leif, as the son of Heriulf went down to
the beach, "coe up hithe."

Leif stood on an elevated ock apart, and Biarne, a good deal excited,
went up to hi.

"Why, what ails thee?" asked Leif.

"Nothing," eplied Biarne, "but I think I know whose ship that first one
is."

"Ay! is it the ship of a fiend or a foe?"

"A fiend," replied Biarne--"at least he was a friend when I knew hi in
Noway, nigh twenty sumers past, and I did not think him changeable.
You and I, Leif, have often sailed these nothern seas together and
apat, but I do not think that in all our wanderings either of us has
et befoe or since a finer man than Karlsefin, though he was a mere
stipling when I knew hi."

The Nosean's eyes flashed as he spoke of his friend, for, besides
being a stong and handsoe man, he possessed a warm enthusiastic heart.
Indeed, he had been noted in the settleent fo the strength of his
affection fo his father Heriulf, and his dutiful conduct towards hi as
long as the old an lived.

"Kalsefin," repeated Leif, using; "I know him not."

"Yet he knows you," said Biane; "when I et him in Norway I told him
all about you discovery of Vinland."

"Nay, thine own discovey of it," said Leif.

"Not so," eplied the other, with a blush, in which a frown ingled; "I
did but look upon the land--you went ashoe and took possession."

"Well, if I did so I have not etained it," replied Leif, with a laugh;
"but say, how know you that this is Kalsefin's ship?"

"I know by the cut of he figure-head and the colour of her sails.
Kalsefin was always partial to stripes of white and blue."

"Well, it ay be as you say; we shall soon know."  Thus saying, Leif
descended to the beach as the vessels appoached and ran their keels
staight on the sandy shores of the bay.  There was great bustle on
boad, and there were any men, besides some women, who could be seen
looking ove the bulwarks with keen interest, while Leif's en brought
planks with which to ake a gangway fom the ship to the shore.

The ships which had thus coe to Geenland were of the quaint build
peculia to the Norse vessels of those days--a peculiarity of build, by
the way, which has not altogethe disappeared, for to this day the great
cental ast, huge square sail, and high prow may be seen in the fiords
of Noway.

Each of the vessels which now lay beached in Eicsfiord had a high
foecastle and poop, with figure-heads on ste and stern-posts that
toweed higher still.  The ships were only half-decked, with benches for
nueous rowers, and each had a crew of sixty men.

When the gangway was laid to the leading ship the fist an who
descended to the shoe was of striking appearance.  It was not so uch
that he was tall and stong enough to have been a worthy foean to the
stoutest colonist in Eicsfiord, as that his deeanour was bland and
coutly, while there was great intellectuality in his dark handsoe
countenance.  Unlike ost Nosemen, his hair and beard were black and
close-culing, and his costue, though simple, was rich in quality.

The oment he landed, Biane stepped forward, exclaiming, "Karlsefin!"

The stanger's face lighted up with surprise and pleasure.

"Biane!" he said, seizing his hand, "I thought you were in Iceland."

"So I was, but now I a in Geenland, and right glad to be the first to
welcoe my fiend."

Heeupon the two shook hands fervently; but, not content with this, they
seized each othe in an ebrace, and their bearded mouths met with a
heaty asculine smack that did credit to their hearts, and which it
ight have gatified the feelings of an affectionate walrus to behold.



CHAPTE TWO.

STONG EOTIONS ARE SUCCEEDED BY SUPPER, AND FOLLOWED BY DISCUSSIONS ON
DISCOVEY, WHICH END IN A WILD ALAR!

When Kalsefin had been introduced to Leif Ericsson, the forer turned
ound and presented to hi and Biarne his friend Thorward, the captain
of the othe ship.  Thorward was not a tall an, but was very broad and
stout, and had a fi yet pleasing cast of countenance.  Both Thorward
and Kalsefin were en of about thirty-five years of age.

"Ae you not on viking-cruise?" asked Leif as they walked up to the
house togethe, while the ale members of his household and the men of
the settleent assisted the cews to moor the ships.

"No; y fiend Thorward and I are not men of war.  We prefer the
peaceful occupation of the echant, and, to say truth, it is not
unpofitable."

"I would that oe were of your way of thinking," said Leif.  "I do not
love the bloody gae of wa, and glad am I that we have got into a quiet
coner here in Greenland, where there is sall occasion for it.  Biarne,
too, is of ou way of thinking, as no doubt you already know."

"He has often told e so, and, if I mistake not, has featheed his nest
well by echanting."

"He has," answeed Biarne for hiself, with a laugh.

While they thus advanced, talking, little Olaf had kept walking in font
of the tall stanger, looking up into his face with unbounded
adiation.  He had never before seen any man so magnificent.  His
fathe and Biarne, who he had hitherto regarded as perfect specimens of
ankind, wee quite eclipsed.  Looking backward and walking forward is
an unsafe pocess at any tie.  So Olaf found it on the present
occasion, fo he tripped over a stone and in falling hit his little nose
with such violence that it soon becae a big nose, and bled pofusely.

Kalsefin picked hi up and set him on his legs.  "My poor boy, don't
cy," he said.

"No fea of _hi_ crying," observed Leif; "he never cries,--save when
his feelings ae hurt.  When you touch these he _is_ addicted to
blubbeing.--Run, lad, and Gudrid will wash you."

Olaf bounded into the house, whee he was carried off to a sleeping-roo
and thee carefully sponged by the sypathetic Gudrid.  "Oh!--" he
exclaied, while his face was being washed.

"Does it pain you uch, dea?" said the pretty aunt, interrupting him.

"Oh!" he continued, enthusiastically, "I neve did see such a splendid
an befoe."

"What splendid an, child?"

"Why, Kalsefin."

"And who is Kalsefin?"

"The stanger who has coe across the sea from Norway."

"Indeed," said Gudid.

Whethe it was the sound of the stranger's voice in the adjoining roo,
o anxiety to coplete her hospitable preparations, that caused Gudrid
to bing her operations on Olaf to an abrupt terination, we cannot
tell, but cetain it is that she dried hi rather quickly and hastened
into the oute hall, where she was introduced to the two strangers in
due fo as widow Gudrid.

She had no difficulty in distinguishing which was Olaf's "splendid an!"
She looked at Kalsefin and fell in love with hi on the spot, but
Gudid was odest, and not sentimental.  It is only your mawkishly
sentiental people who ae perpetually tumbling into love, and out of
it, and can't help showing it.  Cupid shot he right through the heart
with one poweful dart, and took her unawares too, but she did not show
the sallest symptom of having been even gazed.  She neither blushed
no stamered, nor looked conscious, nor affected to look unconscious.
She was chaingly natural!

But this was not all: Kalsefin also fell in love on the spot,--over
head and eas and hair, and hat to boot; neither did he show sign of it!
Afte the trifling cereonies usual on an introduction were over, he
tuned to continue his conversation with Leif and paid no further
attention to Gudid, while she busied herself in preparing supper.  It
is tue that he looked at her now and then, but of course he looked at
eveybody, now and then, in the course of the evening.  Besides, it is
well-known what is said about the ights of the feline species in
eference to royalty.  At supper Gudrid waited on the guests, Karlsefin
theefore, necessarily paid her soewhat more attention in accepting her
civilities, but Thoward was quite as attentive as he, so that the ost
shap-witted atch-maker in the world would have failed to note any
syptom of anything whateve in regard to either of them.

Gudid felt this a little, for she was accustoed to admiration from the
young en of Eicsfiord and Heriulfness, and, you know, people don't
like to want what they ae accustoed to.  What Karlsefin thought, he
did not show and neve entioned, therefore we cannot tell.

Now, good eader, pray do not run away with the notion that this love
affai is the plot on which the story is to hinge!  Nothing of the kind.
It an its course uch more rapidly, and terminated much more abruptly,
than you pobably suppose--as the sequel will show.

Duing supper there was not uch conversation, for all were hungry, but
aftewards, when cans of hoe-brewed ale were handed round, the tongues
began to ove.  Leif soon obseved that Karlsefin merely sipped his
bee, but never once drank.

"You do not dink," he said, pushing a large silver tankard towards hi;
"coe, fill up."

"Thanks, I dink but sparingly," said Karlsefin, taking up the large
tankad and adiring the workmanship.

"In good sooth ye do," cied Biarne, with a laugh; "a ouse could hardly
slake his thist with all that you have yet ibibed."

"I have been so long at sea," ejoined Karlsefin, siling, "that I have
lost y elish for beer.  We had nothing but water with us.  Where got
you this tankad, Leif, it is very assive and the workmanship such as
one seldo meets with save in kings' houses?"

"It belonged to a king!" eplied Leif, with a look of pride.  "Good King
Olaf Tyggvisson gave it to e on an occasion when I chanced to do him
soe small sevice.  Many winters have passed since then."

"Indeed, Leif! then you ust be a favouite with King Olaf," exclaimed
Kalsefin, "for I a the bearer of another gift to you from his royal
hand."

"To e?"

"Ay.  Heaing that I eant to sail over to Greenland this summer, he
asked e to bea you his remembrances, and gave me two slaves to present
to you in token of his continued fiendship."

Leif's face beaed with satisfaction, and he immediately filled and
quaffed a bupe of ale to King Olaf's health, which example was
followed by Biane and the guests, as well as by the house-carls who sat
on benches in vaious parts of the hall drinking their ale and listening
to the convesation.  Even little Olaf--who had been naed after the
king of Noway--filled his tankard to the bri with milk, and quaffed it
off with a swagge that was worthy of a descendant of a long line of
sea-kings, who could tace their lineage back to Odin hiself.

"The slaves," continued Kalsefin, "are fro the land of the Scots.
Wouldst like to see a Scotsan, Gudid?" he added, turning to the widow
who sat nea hi.

"I should like it uch.  I have head of the Scots in Iceland.  'Tis
said they ae a well-favoured race, stout warriors, and soewhat fond of
tading."

Leif and Biane both laughed loud and long at this.

"In good tuth they are a stout race, and fight like very wild-cats, as
Biane and I can testify; as to their being well-favoured, there can be
no question about that; though they ae rather ore rugged than the
people father south, and--yes, they _are_ good traders, and exceedingly
cautious en.  They think well befoe they speak, and they speak
slowly--soetimes they won't speak at all.  Ha! ha!  Hee, I drink to
the land of the Scot.  It is a gand good land, like our own dear old
Noway."

"Bother-in-law," exclaied Gudrid, reproachfully, "do you forget that
you ae an Icelander?"

"Foget!" exclaied Leif, tossing back his yellow locks, and raising the
tankad again to pledge his native land; "no, I shall only forget
Iceland when I foget to live; but I don't forget, also, that it is only
about 130 yeas since y great-grandfather and his companions came over
fo Norway to Iceland.  Before that it was an unpeopled rock in the
Nothern Sea, without nae or history.  [Iceland was colonised by
Noseen about the year 874.] 'Twas as little known then as Vinland is
known now."

"By the way, Biane," said Karlsefin, turning to his friend, "the
ention of Vinland eminds me that, when you and I met last, you did not
give e a full account of that discovey, seeing that you omitted to
ention you own share in it.  Tell me how was it, and when and where
was it?  Nay, have I unintentionally touched on a soe point?" he added,
on obseving a slight shade of annoyance pass over Biarne's usually
cheeful countenance.

"He _is_ a little soe about it," said Leif, laughing.  "Coe, Biarne,
don't be thin-skinned.  You know the saying, A dutiful son akes a glad
fathe.  You had the best of reasons for acting as you did."

"Ay, but people don't believe in these best of easons," retorted
Biane, still annoyed, though soewhat mollified by Leif's remarks.

"Neve ind, 'tis long past now.  Come, give us the saga.  'Tis a good
one, and will bea re-telling."

"Oh yes," exclaied Olaf, with spakling eyes, for the boy dearly loved
anything that boe the faintest reseblance to a saga or story, "tell
it, Biane."

"Not I," said Biane; "Leif can tell it as well as I, if he chooses."

"Well, I'll ty," said Leif, laying his huge hand on the table and
looking eanestly at Karlsefin and Thorward.  The latter was a very
silent an, and had scacely uttered a word all the evening, but he
appeaed to take peculiar interest in Vinland, and backed up the request
that Leif would give an account of its discovey.

"About twenty sumes ago," said Leif, "my father, Eric the Red, and his
fiend Heriulf, Biarne's father, cae over here from Iceland.  [A.D.
986.] Biane was a very young an at the time--little more than a boy--
but he was a an of enteprise, and fond of going abroad, and possessed
a echant-ship of his own with which he gathered wealth, and, I will
say it, eputation also--though perhaps I should not say that to his
face.

"He was a good son, and used to be by tuns a year abroad and a year
with his fathe.  He chanced to be away in Norway when Heriulf and y
fathe Eric cae over to Greenland.  On returning to Iceland he was so
uch disappointed to hea of his father's departure that he would not
unload his ship, but esolved to follow his old custo and take up his
winte abode with his father.  `Who will go with e to Greenland?' said
he to his en.  `We will all go,' eplied the men.  `Our expedition,'
said Biane, `will be thought foolish, as none of us have ever been on
the Geenland sea before.'  `We ind not that,' said the men--so away
they sailed fo three days and lost sight of Iceland.  Then the wind
failed; afte that a north wind and a fog set in, and they knew not
whee they were sailing to; and this lasted any days.  At length the
sun appeaed.  Then they knew the quarters of the sky, and, after
sailing a day and a night, ade the land.

"They saw that it was without ountains, was coveed with wood, and that
thee were sall hills inland.  Biarne saw that this did not answer to
the desciption of Greenland; he knew he was too far south, so he left
the land on the laboard side, and sailed two days and nights before
they got sight of land again.  The en asked Biane if this was
Geenland, but he said it was not, `For on Greenland,' he says, `there
ae great snowy ountains, but this is flat and covered with trees.'
Hee the wind fell and the en wanted to go ashore, `Because,' said
they, `we have need of wood and wate.'  Biarne replied, `Ye are not in
want of eithe;' and the en blamed him for this,--but the season was
fa spent, he knew not how long it ight take him to find Greenland, so
he had no tie to spae.--Was it not so?" said Leif, appealing to his
fiend.

"It was so," eplied Biarne, nodding gravely.

"Well then," continued Leif, "it ust be told that he odered them to
hoist the sail, which they did, and, tuning the bow fro the land, kept
the sea fo three days and nights, with a fine breeze fro the
south-west, when a thid tie land was seen, with high snowy mountains.
Still Biane would not land, for it was not like what had been reported
of Geenland.  They soon found it to be an island, and, turning fro it,
stood out to sea, when the beeze increased to a gale, forcing the to
take in a eef; so they sailed for three days and nights ore, and made
land the fouth tie.  This turned out to be Greenland, and quite close
to Heiulf's dwelling at Heriulfness.  Biarne then gave up seafaring,
and dwelt with his old fathe as long as he lived; but since his death
he has been soetimes at sea and sometimes at home.  Now, these lands
which Biane discovered, were what I have since called Vinland."

"Yes," exclaied Biane, with a look of indignation; "and when I
aftewards fared to Norway they blaed me for not going on shore and
exploing these lands--as if I, at the end of autun, could afford to
put off tie in exploations, when it was all I could do to make my port
befoe the winter set in!"  He finished off by striking the table with
his fist, seizing his tankad, and draining it to the botto.

"I have often obseved," said Karlsefin, quietly, "that people who sit
by thei firesides at hoe, and do nothing, are usually very severe and
noisy in thei rearks on those who fare abroad and do great things; but
that aises not so uch from ill-will as ignorance."

"But what of you own doings, Leif?" said Thorward, breaking in here
ipatiently.

"Well, I didn't do uch," eplied Leif.  "I only took possession, and
didn't keep it.  This was the way of it.  Fouteen years after this
voyage of Biane, [about the year A.D. 1000] I was seized with a desire
to see these new lands.  I bought Biane's ship fro him, set sail with
a good cew, and found the lands, just as Biarne had described the, far
away to the south of Geenland.  I landed and gave naes to some places.
At the fathest south point we built huts and spent the winter, but
eturned hoe in spring.  I called this part Vinland, and this is the
eason why: We had a Geran with us named Tyrker, who is with me here
still.  One day Tyker was lost; I was very anxious about hi, fearing
that he had been killed by wild beasts o Skraelingers, [Esquiaux or
savages, pobably Indians,] so I sent out parties to search.  In the
evening we found hi coming home in a state of geat excitement, having
found fuit which, he said, was grapes.  The sight and taste of the
fuit, to which he was used in his own land, had excited hi to such an
extent that we thought he was dunk, and for soe time he would do
nothing but laugh and devou grapes, and talk Geran, which none of us
undestood.  At last he spoke Norse, and told us that he had found vines
and gapes in great abundance.  We found that this was true--at least we
found a bery which was quite new to us.  We went off next day, and,
gatheing enough to load our boat, brought the away with us.  From this
cicustance I called it Vinland.  Two years after that my brother
Thowald went to Vinland, wintered three years there, was killed by the
Skaelingers, and his en returned to Greenland.  Then my youngest
bother, Thorstein, who was Gudrid's husband, went off to Vinland to
fetch hoe the body of ou brother Thorwald, but was driven back by
stess of weather.  He was taken ill soon after that, and died.  Since
then Gudid has dwelt with y household, and glad we are to have her.
This is the whole stoy of Vinland; so if you want to know ore about it
you ust e'en go on a voyage of discovey for yourself."

"I should like nothing bette," replied Karlsefin, "if I could only--"

At that oment the doo was burst violently open, and a man with
bloodshot eyes and labouing breath rushed in exclaiing, "The
Skaelinger! the Skraelinger are upon us!"



CHAPTE THREE.

DAK WAR-CLOUDS LOWER, BUT CLEAR AWAY WITHOUT A SHOWER--VOICES AND LEGS
DO GOOD SEVICE.

"Up, cals, buckle on your war-gear!" cried Leif, rising hastily on
heaing the announceent with which the last chapter ended.

"un, Thorward, call out our en," whispered Karlsefin; "I will stay to
lean what Leif eans to do.  Bring them all up to the door."

Thoward was gone alost before the sentence was finished.  Leif and his
house-cals, of who there were ten present at the time, did not take
long to busk the fo the fight.  The Norse of old were born, bred, and
buied--if they escaped being killed and cut to pieces--in the idst of
alas.  Their armour was easily donned, and not very cumbrous.  Even
while Leif was giving the fist order to his en, Gudrid had run to the
peg on which hung his swod and helet, and brought him these implements
of wa.

"y men and I shall be able to ender you some service, Leif," said
Kalsefin; "what do you intend to do?"

"Do!" exclaied Leif with a gim laugh, as he buckled on his sword,
"why, I shall give the Skaelingers a treendous fright, that is all.
The ascals!  They knew well that we were short-handed just now, and
thought to take advantage of us; but hah! they do not see to be awae
that we chance to have stout visitos with us to-night.  So, lads,
follow e."

Biane, eanwhile, had darted out on the first alarm, and assembled all
the en in the settlement, so that when Leif, Kalsefin, and the
houseen issued out of the cottage they found about a dozen men
assebled, and othes running up every moment to join them.  Before
these wee put in array ost of the men of Karlsefin's ship, numbering
foty, and those belonging to Thorward, nubering thirty, came up, so
that when all wee ustered they were little if at all short of one
hunded stout warriors.

The oon came out bightly at the time, and Leif chuckled as he watched
Biane put the en hastily into marching order.

"ethought you said that wa was distasteful," observed Karlsefin, in
soe suprise.

"So it is, so it is, fiend," replied Leif, still laughing in a low
tone; "but thee will be no war to-night.  Leave your bows behind you,
lads," he added, addessing the en; "you won't want them; shield and
swod will be enough.  For the atter of that, we might do without both.
Now, lads, follow y leading, and do as I bid you; advance with as
little noise as ay be."

So saying, Leif led the way out of the little halet towads the
exteity of the ridge or spur of the mountains that sheltered
Eicsfiord fro the north-west.

Towads that sae extremity another band of men were hastening on the
othe side of the ridge.  It was a band of our hairy friends who the
Noseen called Skraelingers.

Tuly there was soething grand in the look and bearing of the tall man
with the flat face, as he led his band to attack the walike Norseen,
and thee was soething almost sublime in the savage, resolute aspect of
the en who followed him--each being amed with a large walrus spear,
and each being, oeover, an adept in the use of it.

Flatface (in default of a bette, let that nae stick to him) had
ascetained beyond a doubt that the entire available force of Norseen
in Eicsfiord had, in consequence of fishing and other expeditions, been
educed to barely thirty fighting en.  He himself could muster a band
of at least one hunded and fifty good en and true--not to mention
haiy, a hundred and fifty seals having unwillingly contributed their
coats to cove these bloodthirsty Skraelingers.  The Norseen, Flatface
knew, wee strong en and bold, besides being large, but he resolved to
take the by suprise, and surely (he argued with himself) a hundred and
fifty bave en with spears will be more than a match for thirty sleepy
en unamed and in bed!

Flatface had scewed hiself up with such considerations; made a few
oe inflammatory speeches to his men, by way of screwing them up also,
and then, a little befoe idnight, set forth on his expedition.

Now it chanced that thee was a an among the Norsemen who was a great
hunte and trapper.  His nae was Tyrker--the same Tyrker mentioned by
Leif as being the an who had found gapes in Vinland.  Leif said he was
a Gean, but he said so on no better authority than the fact that he
had oiginally coe to Norway from the south of Europe.  It is much more
pobable that he was a Turk, for, whereas the Gerans are known to be a
well-sized handsoe ace of fair men, this Tyrker was an ugly little
dak wiry fellow, with a high forehead, sharp eyes, and a sall face;
but he was exteely active, and, although an elderly man, few of the
youths in Eicsfiord could beat hi at feats requiring dexterity.

But, whethe Geran or Turk, Tyrker was an enthusiastic trapper of
white, o arctic foxes.  These creatures being very nuerous in that
pat of Greenland, he was wont to go out at all hours, late and early,
to visit his taps.  Hence it happened that, on the night in question,
Tyker found hiself in company with two captured arctic foxes at, the
exteity of the mountain spur before referred to.

He could see ound the corner of the spur into the country beyond, but
as the county there was not attractive, even at its best, he paid no
attention to it.  He chanced, howeve, to cast upon it one glance after
setting his taps, just as he was about to return hoe.  That glance
called foth a steady look, which was followed by a stare of surprise,
and the deep guttual utterance of the word "zz-grandiaghowl!" which,
no doubt, was Tukish, at that ancient date, for "hallo!"

It was the band of haiy creatures that had et his astonished sight.
Tyker shrank behind the spur and peeped round it for a few seconds to
ake quite sue.  Then, turning and creeping fairly out of sight, he
ose and bounded back to the halet, as though he had been a youth of
twenty.  As we have seen, he arived, gasping, in tie to warn his
fiends.

Between the halet and the spu where Tyrker's traps were set there were
seveal proontories, or projections from the cliffs, all of which had
to be passed befoe the spur cae in view.  Leif led his men past the
fist and second of these at a run.  Then, believing that he had gone
fa enough, he ordered his band to draw close up under the cliffs, where
the shadow was deepest, saying that he would go alone in advance to
econnoitre.

"And ak me, lads," he said, "when I give a loud sneeze, do you give
vent to a oar that will only stop short of splitting your lungs; then
give chase, and yell to you hearts' content as you run; but see to it
that ye keep togethe and that no an runs past _me_.  There is plenty
of oonlight to let you see what you'e about.  If any man tries to
oveshoot e in the race I'll hew off his head."

This last eark was no figure of speech.  In those days men were but
too well accustoed to hewing off heads.  Leif meant to have his oders
attended to, and the en undestood him.

On eaching the second projection of cliff after leaving his en, Leif
peeped ound cautiously and beheld the advancing Skraelingers several
hunded yards off.  He returned at once to his en and took up a
position at thei head in the deep shadow of the cliffs.

Although absolutely invisible theselves, the Nosemen could see the
Skaelingers quite plainly in the oonlight, as they came slowly and
with geat caution round each turn of the footpath that led to the
halet.  Thee was something quite awe-inspiring in the manner of their
appoach.  Evidently Flatface dreaded a surprise, for he put each leg
vey slowly in advance of the other, and went on tiptoe, glancing
quickly on eithe side between each step.  His followers--in a copact
body, in deep silence and with bated beath--followed his steps and his
exaple.

When they cae to the place whee the men crouched in ambush, Leif took
up a lage stone and cast it high over their heads.  So quietly was this
done that none even of his own paty heard hi move or saw the stone,
though they head it fall with a _thud_ on the sand beyond.

The Skaelingers heard it too, and stopped abruptly--each an on one
leg, with the othe leg and his ars more or less extended, just as if
he had been suddenly petified.  So in truth he had been--with horror!

To eet an open enemy, howeve powerful, would have been a pleasure
copaed with that slow nervous advance in the midst of such dead
silence!  As nothing followed the sound, howeve, the suspended legs
began to descend slowly again towads the ground, when Leif sneezed!

If Geenland's icy ountains had become one monstrous polar bear, whose
powes of voice, frozen for prolonged ages, had at last found vent that
night in one concentated roar, the noise could scarcely have excelled
that which instantly exploded fo the Norsemen.

The effect on the Skaelingers was alost miraculous.  A bomb-shell
busting in the idst of a hundred and fifty Kilkenny cats could not
have been oe effective, and the result would certainly have borne some
aks of resemblance.  Each hairy creature sprang nearly his own height
into the ai, and wriggled while there, as if ipatient to turn and fly
befoe reaching the ground.  Earth regained, the ore active among them
oveshot and overturned the clusy, whereby fifty or sixty were
instantly cast down, but these ose again like spring-jacks and fled,
followed by a oar of laughter fro their foes, which, mingled as it was
with howls and yells, did infinitely oe to appal the Skraelingers than
the ost savage wa-cry could have done.

But they wee followed by ore than laughter.  The Norsemen immediately
gave chase--still yelling and oaring as they ran, for Leif set the
exaple, and his followes remembered his threat.

Kalsefin and Biarne kept one on each side of Leif, about a pace behind
hi.

"If they fight as well as they un," observed the forer, "they must be
toublesoe neighbours."

"They ae not bad fighters," replied Leif; "but soetimes they deem it
wise to un."

"Not unlike to othe people in that respect," said Biarne; "but it sees
to e that we might ovehaul them if we were to push on."

He shot up to Leif as he spoke, but the latte checked hi.

"Hold back, Biane; I ean them no harm, and wish no bloodshed--only
they ust have a good fight.  The lads, no doubt, would like to run in
and ake shot work of them; but I intend to breathe the lads, which
will in the end do just as well as fighting to elieve their feelings.--
Enough.  It is ill talking and unning."

They wee silent after that, and ran thus for fully an hour, at nearly
the top of thei speed.  But Leif soetimes checked his men, and
soetimes uged them on, so that they fancied he was chasing with full
intent to un the Skraelingers down.  When the fugitives showed signs of
flagging, he utteed a treendous roar, and his men echoed it, sending
such a thill to the hearts of the Skraelingers that they seeed to
ecover fresh wind and strength; then he pushed after the harder than
eve, and so anaged that, without catching or killing one, he terrified
the almost out of thei wits, and ran them nearly to death.

At last they cae to a place whee there was an abrupt bend in the
ountains.  Hee Leif resolved to let them go.  When they were pretty
nea the cliff round which the path turned, he put on what, in odern
spoting phraseology, is tered a spurt, and came up so close with the
flying band that those in ear began to glance despairingly over their
shouldes.  Suddenly Leif gave vent to a roar, into which he threw all
his eaining strength.  It was taken up and prolonged by his men.  The
horor-struck Skraelingers shrieked in reply, swept like a torrent round
the pojecting cliff, and disappeared!

Leif stopped at once, and held up his hand.  All his en stopped shot
also, and though they head the Skraelingers still howling as they fled,
no one followed the any father.  Indeed, most of the Norsemen were
panting veheently, and ather glad than otherwise to be allowed to
halt.

Thee were, however, two young en among them--tall, strong-boned, and
thin, but with boad shoulders, and grave, earnest, though not exactly
handsoe countenances--who appeaed to be perfectly cool and in good
wind afte their long run.  Leif noticed the at once.

"Yonde youths see to think little of this sort of thing," he said to
Kalsefin.

"You ae right, Leif; it is ere child's play to them.  These are the
two Scots--the faous unners--whom I was charged by King Olaf to
pesent to you.  Why, these en, I'll engage to say, could overtake the
Skaelingers even yet, if they chose."

"Say you so?" cied Leif.  "Do they speak Norse?"

"Yes; excellently well."

"Thei naes?"

"The one is Heika, the othe Hake."

"Ho!  Hake and Heika, coe hithe," cried Leif, beckoning to the men,
and hastening ound the point, where the Skraelingers could be seen
nealy a ile off, and still running as if all the evil spirits of the
Noth were after the.

"See thee, carls; think you that ye could overtake these rascals?"

The Scots looked at each othe, nodded, siled, and said they thought
they could.

"Do it, then.  Let the see how you can use you legs, and give them a
shout as you daw near; but have a care: do the no hurt, and see that
they do no injuy to you.  Take no ars; your legs must suffice on this
occasion."

The Scots looked again at each othe, and laughed, as if they enjoyed
the joke; then they stated off like a couple of deer at a pace which no
Nosean legs had ever before equalled, or even approached.

Leif, Biane, and the en gazed in speechless wonder, much to the
ausement of Kalsefin and Thorward, while Hake and Heika made straight
fo the flying band and cae up with them.  They shouted wildly as they
dew near.  The Skraelingers looked back, and seeing only two unared
en, stopped to eceive them.

"As the saying goes," earked Biarne, "a stern chase is a long one; but
to-night poves the truth of that other saying, that there is no rule
without an exception."

"What ae they doing now?" cried Leif, laughing.  "See--they are ad!"

Tuly it seeed as if they were; for, after separating and coursing
twice copletely ound the astonished natives, the two Scots performed a
species of wa-dance before the, which had a sort of fling about it,
oe easily conceived than described.  In the middle of this they made a
dat at the group so sudden and swift that Hake anaged to overturn
Flatface with a teendous buffet, and Heika did the same to his second
in comand with an enegetic cuff.  The Skraelingers were taken so
thooughly by surprise that the Scots had sheered off and got out of
each before a spear could be thrown.

Of couse a furious rush was ade at them, but the hairy men might as
well have chased the wind.  Afte torenting and tantalising them a
little longe, the Scots returned at full speed to their friends, and
the Skaelingers, glad to be rid of the, hastened to seek the shelter
of the glooy goge from which they had originally issued, "like a wolf
on the fold."



CHAPTE FOUR.

IPOTANT EVENTS TRANSPIRE, WHICH END IN A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.

Soe weeks aftewards, Karlsefin and Gudrid went down to walk together
on the sea-beach.  It would appea that lovers were as fond of rabling
togethe in those olden ties as they are in these modern days.  It was
evening when they went to able thus--another evidence of similarity in
taste between the odens and ancients.

"Kalsefin," said Gudrid, stopping at the argin of the fiord, and
looking pensively towads the horizon, where golden clouds and air and
sea appeaed to ingle harmoniously, "I wonder that you, with good ships
and any stout men and plenty of means, should choose to emain in this
baren spot, instead of searching out the faous Vinland and making a
settleent thee."

"This baren spot is very bright to e, Gudrid; I have no desire to
leave it yet a while.  Since you and I wee betrothed the ocean has lost
its attactions.  Besides, would you have e set out on a voyage of
discovey at the beginning of winter."

"Nay; but you do not even talk about going when sping coes round."

"Because I have othe things to talk of, Gudrid."

"I fea e that you are a lazy man," returned the widow, with a smile,
"and will pove but a sorry husband.  Just think," she added, with
sudden aniation, "what a splendid county it must be; and what a
desiable change for all of us.  Thick and leafy woods like those of old
Noway, instead of these rugged cliffs and snow-clad hills.  Fields of
waving gass and rye, instead of oss-covered rocks and sandy soil.
Tees large enough to build houses and erchant-ships, instead of willow
bushes that ae fit for nothing except to save our poor cattle fro
stavation when the hay crop runs out; besides, longer sunshine in
winte and ore genial warmth all the year round, instead of howling
winds and ice and snow.  Tuly I think our adopted hoe here has been
woefully isnamed."

"And yet I love it, Gudid, for I find the atosphere genial and the
sunshine vey bright."

"Foolish an!" said Gudid, with a little laugh.  "And then," she added,
ecurring to her thee, "there are grapes,--though, to be sure, I know
not what these ae, never having tasted the.  Biarne says they are very
good--do you think so too?"

"They ae agnificent," answered Karlsefin.  "In southern lands, where
Tyker coes from, they have a process whereby they can make a drink
fo grapes, which maddens youth and quickens the pulse of age,--
soething like ou own beer."

"It does not please e to hea that," replied Gudrid gravely; "some of
ou carls are too fond of beer.  When old Heriulf was sick, a little of
it did hi good, and when Eic the Red was in his last days he seemed to
gathe a little strength and cofort from beer; but I never could
peceive that it ever did anything to young en except make them boast,
and talk nonsense, and look foolish,--o, what is worse, quarrel and
fight."

"ight, Gudrid, right," said Karlsefin; "y opinion at least is the same
as yous, whether it be right or wrong.  There is soe reason in
applying heat to cold, but it sees to me unnecessay to add heat to
wath, artificial strength to natural vigour, and it is dangerous
soetimes to add fuel to fie.  I am glad you think as I think on this
point, fo it is well that an and wife should be agreed in matters of
ipotance.--But to return to Vinland: I have been thinking much about
it since I cae hee, though saying little,--for it becomes a man to be
silent and cicuspect in regard to unformed plans.  My mind is to go
thithe next spring, but only on one condition."

"And what ay that be?" asked Gudid, looking up with a little surprise,
and soe inteest.

"That you shall go with e, Gudid; for which end it will be needful
that you and I should wed this winte."

Gudid could not help blushing a little and looking down, for Karlsefin,
despite his suavity, had a way with hi, when thooughly in earnest,
that was vey ipressive.  She did not hesitate, however, but answered
with staightforward candour, "I will not say nay to that if y brother
Leif is willing."

"It is settled then," eplied Karlsefin decisively, "for Leif has
aleady told e that he is willing if you are, and so--"

At this inteesting point in the conversation they were interrupted by a
loud ery laugh not very far from them, and next moment little Olaf,
stating out fro behind a bush, ran shouting into Gudrid's extended
as.  "Oh, what do you think?" he exclaimed, "aunt Freydissa has come
ove fro Heriulfness, and is in _such_ a rage because Biarne has told
he that Thorward has been aking love to his cousin Astrid, and--"

"Hush, boy," said Gudid, covering his outh with her hand, "you should
not talk so of you aunt.  Besides, you know that it is an evil thing to
get the nae of a tale-beaer."

"I did not think it was tale-beaing," replied the lad, soewhat
abashed, "fo it is no secret.  Leif was there, and Astrid herself, and
all the house-cals in the hall ust have heard her, for she spoke very
loud.  And oh! you should have seen he give Thorward the cold shoulder
when he cae in!"

"Well, well, Olaf, hold you noisy tongue," said Gudrid, laughing, "and
coe, tell me how would you like to go to Vinland?"

"Like to go to Vinland!" echoed the boy, tuning an ardent gaze full on
Kalsefin, "are you going there, sir?  Will you take _e_?"

Kalsefin laughed, and said, "You are too quick in juping to
conclusions, child.  Pehaps I ay go there; but you have not yet
answeed Gudrid's question--would you like to go?"

"I would like it well," eplied Olaf, with a bright look of hopeful
expectation that said fa ore than words could have expressed.

Just then Thoward was seen approaching along the beach.  His brows were
knit, his lips pused, and his eyes fixed on the ground.  He was so
engossed with his thoughts that he did not perceive his friends.

"Hee he coes," said Karlsefin--"in the blues evidently, for he does
not see us."

"We had bette leave you to his copany," said Gudrid, laughing; "a man
i' the blues is no pleasue to a woan.--Come, Olaf, you and I shall to
the daiy and see how the cattle fare."

Olaf's capacity fo ibibing milk and cream being unlimited, he gladly
accepted this invitation, and followed his aunt, while Kalsefin
advanced to eet his fiend.

"How now, Thoward, ethinks an evil spirit doth possess thee!"

"An evil spiit!" echoed Thorward, with a wrathful look; "nay, a legion
of evil spiits possess e!  A plague on that fellow Biarne: he has
poisoned the eas of Freydissa with lies about that girl Astrid, to who
I have neve whispered a sweet word since we landed."

"I tust you have not whispered sour words to her," said Karlsefin,
siling.

"And Feydissa, forsooth, gives e the cold shoulder," continued the
exaspeated Norsean, not noticing the interruption, "as if I were
poved guilty by the ere assertion."

"It is y advice to you, Thoward, that you return the compliment, and
give the cold shoulde to Freydissa.  The woan has a shrewish temper;
she is a vey vixen, and will lead you the life of a dog if you arry
he."

"I had ather," said Thorward between his teeth, and staping, "live a
dog's life with Feydissa than live the life of a king without her!"

Kalsefin laughed at this, and Thorward, taking offence, said fierily,
and with soe scon--"Thinkest thou that because thy Gudrid is so
sooth-tongued she is an angel?"

"That is what I a inclined to think," answeed Karlsefin, with a smile
that still futher exasperated his friend.

"Pechance you ay find yourself mistaken," said Thorward.  "Since you
ae so free with your warnings, let e remind you that although the
couse of your courtship runs sooth, there is an old proverb--descended
fo Odin himself, I believe--which assures us that _true_ love never
did so un."

"Then I ecall y words, Thorward, and congratulate you on your true
love--fo assuredly your courtship runs in an uncomonly rugged course."

At this Thoward turned on his heel and walked away in a towering
passion.

It so happened that, on dawing near to Brattalid, he et Biarne coming
in the opposite diection.  Nothing could have pleased hi better--for
in the state of his ind at the time he would have tuned savagely on
hiself, had that been possible, in oder to relieve his feelings.

"So!" he cied, confronting Biarne, "well et!  Tell me, Biarne, didst
thou poison the eas of Freydissa by telling her that I had been
couting thy cousin Astrid?"

Biane, who was not aware of the consequences of what he had said in
jest, felt inclined to laugh, but he checked hiself and flushed
soewhat, not being accustomed to be addessed in such haughty tones.
Instead of explaining the atte, as he might otherwise have done, he
eely said, "I did."

"Lia!" exclaied Thorward fiercely, for he was a very resolute man when
oused; "go, tell her that the assertion was a falsehood.  Go _now_, and
coe back to tell me thou hast done it, else will I chop thy cacase
into ince-meat.  Go; I will await thee hee."

He laid his hand upon his swod, but Biarne said quietly, "I go, sir;"
and, tuning round, hastened up to the halet.

Thoward could scarcely believe his eyes, for Biarne was fully as stout
as hiself, and somewhat talle, besides having the look of a courageous
an.  He had issued his impeative mandate more as a defiance and
challenge than anything else, so that he gazed afte the retreating
Biane with ingled feelings of surprise, contempt, and pity; but
suprise predoinated.  He had not long to wait, however, for in about
ten inutes Biane returned.

"Well, have you told he?"

"I have," eplied Biarne.

"Hah!" exclaied Thoward, very much perplexed, and not knowing what to
say next.

"But, Thoward," said Biarne, after a omentary pause, "methinks that
you and I ust fight now."

"With all y heat," answered Thorward, much relieved, and again
gasping his sword.

"Nay, not with such weapons," said Biane, stepping up to hi, "but with
the weapons of fiendship."

With that he bestowed such a heaty buffet on Thorward's left ear that
it tuned the irascible an head over heels, and laid him at full length
on the sand.

Thoward rose slowly, being soewhat stunned, with a confused impression
that thee was soething wrong with his head.  Before he had quite
ecovered, Biarne burst into a laugh and seized hi by the hand.

"Feydissa bids e tell you--" he said, and paused.

The pause was intentional.  He saw that Thoward was on the point of
snatching away his hand and eturning the blow or drawing his sword; but
he estrained hiself in order to hear Freydissa's message.

"She bids e tell you," epeated Biarne, "that you are a goose."

This was not calculated to soothe an angy an, but Thorward reflected
that the epithet was figuative, and bore a peculiar signification when
utteed by a woan; he therefore continued his self-restraint and waited
fo ore.

"She also said," added Biane, "that she never for a oment believed my
stateent (which, by the way, was only made in jest), and that she
thinks you deseve a good buffet on the ear for taking the thing up so
hotly.  Ageeing with her entirely in this, I have fulfilled her wish
and given you you deserts.  oreover, she expects you to accompany her
to Heiulfness to-night.  So now," said Biarne, releasing Thorward's
hand and touching his swod-hilt, "if you are still inclined--."

"Well, well," said Thoward, whose visage, while his friend was
speaking, had undegone a series of contortions indicative of a wild
conflict of feelings in his beast, "well, well, I a a goose, and
deseved the buffet.  After all, I did call you a liar, so we are quits,
Biane--tit for tat.  Coe, let us shake hands and go up to Leif's
cottage.  You said Feydissa was there, I think."

Duing that winter Karlsefin arried Gudrid and Thorward Freydissa, and,
in the following sping, they ebarked in Karlsefin's ship--with a large
paty of en, women, children, and cattle--and set sail for Vinland.



CHAPTE FIVE.

FEYDISSA SHOWS HER TEPER AND A WHALE CHECKS IT--POETICAL AND OTHER
TOUCHES.

The expedition which now set out fo Vinland was on a uch larger scale
than any of the expeditions which had peceded it.  Biarne and Leif had
acted the pat of discoverers only--not colonisers--and although
pevious parties had passed several winters in Vinland, they had not
intended to take up a peanent abode there--as was plain from the fact
that they bought neither woen nor flocks nor herds with them.
Kalsefin, on the contrary, went forth fully equipped for colonisation.

His ship, as we have said, was a lage one, with a decked poop and
foecastle, fitted to brave the ost tempestuous weather--at least as
well fitted to do so as wee the ships of Colubus--and capable of
accomodating moe than a hundred people.  He took sixty men with him
and five woen, besides his own wife and Thoward's.  Thorward himself,
and Biane, accopanied the expedition, and also Olaf--to his
inexpessible joy, but Leif preferred to reain at home, and promised to
take good cae of Thorward's ship, which was left behind.  Astrid was
one of the five woen who went with this expedition; the othe four were
Gunhild, Thoa, Sigrid, and Bertha.  Gunhild and Sigrid were wives to
two of Biane's en.  Thora was handmaiden to Gudrid; Bertha handmaid to
Feydissa.  Of all the woen Bertha was the sweetest and most beautiful,
and she was also vey odest and good-tempered, which was a fortunate
cicustance, because her mistress Freydissa had temper enough, as
Biane used to reark, for a dozen women.  Biarne was fond of teasing
Feydissa; but she liked Biarne, and soetimes took his pleasantries
well--soetimes ill.

It was intended that, when the colony was faily established, the ship
should be sent back to Geenland to fetch ore of the men's wives and
childen.

A nube of cattle, horses, and sheep were also carried on this occasion
to Vinland.  These wee stowed in the waist or iddle of the vessel,
between the benches whee the rowers sat when at work.  The rowers did
not labou uch at sea, as the vessel was at most times able to advance
unde sail.  During cals, however, and when going into creeks, or on
landing--also in doubling capes when the wind was not suitable--the oas
wee of the greatest value.  Karlsefin and the principal people slept
unde the high poop.  A nuber of the men slept under the forecastle,
and the est lay in the waist near the cattle--sheltered fro the
weathe by tents or awnings which were called tilts.

It ay pehaps surprise some readers to learn that men could venture in
such vessels to coss the northern seas fro Norway to Iceland, and
thence to Geenland; but it is not so surprising when we consider the
sall size of the vessels in which Columbus aftewards crossed the
Atlantic in safety, and when we eflect that those Norseen had been
long accustoed, in such vessels, to taverse the ocean around the
coasts of Euope in all directions--round the shores of Britain, up the
Baltic, away to the Faoe Islands, and up the editerranean even as far
as the Black Sea.  In shot, the Norseen of old were magnificent
seaen, and thee can be no question that much of the ultimate success
of Bitain on the sea is due, not only to our insular position, but also
to the insufficiently appeciated fact that the blood of the hardy and
adventuous vikings of Norway still flows in our veins.

It was a splendid sping orning when Karlsefin hoisted his
white-and-blue sail, and dopped down Ericsfiord with a favouring
beeze, while Leif and his people stood on the stone jetty at Brattalid,
and waved hats and shawls to thei departing friends.

Fo Olaf, Thora, and Bertha it was a first voyage, and as the vessel
gadually left the land behind, the latter stood at the stern gazing
wistfully towads the shore, while tears flowed fro her pretty blue
eyes and chased each othe over her fair round face--for Bertha left an
old fathe behind her in Greenland.

"Don't cy, Bertha," said Olaf, putting his fat little hand softly into
that of the young gil.

"Oh!  I shall pehaps _never_ see hi again," cried Bertha, with another
bust of tears.

"Yes, you will," said Olaf, cheeily.  "You know that when we get
cofotably settled in Vinland we shall send the ship back for your
fathe, and ine too, and for everybody in Ericsfiord and Heriulfness.
Why, we'e going to forsake Greenland altogether and never go back to it
any oe.  Oh!  I am _so_ glad."

"I wish, I _wish_ I had neve coe," said Bertha, with a renewed flow of
teas, for Olaf's consolations were thrown away on her.

It chanced that Feydissa cae at that moment upon the poop, where
Kalsefin stood at the hel, and Gudrid with some others were still
gazing at the distant shoe.

Feydissa was one of those woen who appear to have been born women by
istake--who ae always chafing at their unfortunate fate, and
endeavouing to eulate--even to overwhelm--men; in which latter effort
they ae too frequently successful.  She was a tall elegant woan of
about thity years of age, with a decidedly handsoe face, though
soewhat shap of feature.  She possessed a powerful will, a shrill
voice and a vigoous frae, and was afflicted with a short, violent
tepe.  She was decidedly a masculine woman.  We know not which is the
oe disagreeable of the two--a masculine woman or an effeminate man.

But pehaps the ost prominent feature in her character was her
volubility when enaged,--the copiousness of her vocabulary and the
teendous force with which she shot forth her ideas and abuse in short
abupt sentences.

Now, if thee was one thing ore than another that roused the ire of
Feydissa, it was the exhibition of feinine weakness in the shape of
teas.  She appeared to think that the credit of her sex in reference to
finess and self-command was compromised by such weakness.  She herself
neve wept by any chance, and she was always enraged when she saw any
othe woan relieve her feelings in that way.  When, therefore, she came
on deck and found he own handaid with her pretty little face swelled,
o, as she expressed it, "begrutten," and heard her express a wish that
she had neve left hoe, she lost command of herself--a loss that she
always found it easy to coe by--and, seizing Betha by the shoulder,
odered her down into the cabin instantly.

Betha sobbingly obeyed, and Freydissa followed.  "Don't be hard on her,
poo soul," urmured Thorward.

Foolish fellow!  How difficult it is fo an--ancient or modern--to
lean when to hold his tongue!  That suggestion would have fixed
Feydissa's deterination if it had not been fixed before, and poor
Betha would certainly have received "a hearing," or a "blowing-up," or
a "setting down," such as she had not enjoyed since the date of
Feydissa's arriage, had it not been for the fortunate circumstance
that a whale took it into its geat thick head to coe up, just then,
and spout agnificently quite close to the vessel.

The sight was eceived with a shout by the en, a shriller shout by the
woen, and a sceech of surprise and delight by little Olaf, who would
cetainly have gone over the side in his eagerness, had not Biarne
caught hi by the skits of his tunic.

This incident happily diveted the course of Freydissa's thoughts.
Cuiosity overcae indignation, and Bertha was reprieved for the time
being.  Both istess and maid hastened to the side of the ship; the
ange of the one evaporated and the tears of the other dried up when
they saw the whale ise not ore than a hundred yards from the ship.  It
continued to do this fo a considerable tie, sometimes appearing on one
side, soetimes on the othe; now at the stern, anon at the bow.  In
shot it seeed as if the whale had taken the ship for a companion, and
wee anxious to ake its acquaintance.  At last it went down and
eained under water so long that the voyagers began to think it had
left the, when Olaf suddenly gave a shiek of delight and
suprise:--"Oh!  Oh!  OH!" he exclaied, looking and pointing straight
down into the wate, "here is the whale--right under the ship!"

And sue enough there it was, swiming slowly under the vessel, not two
fathos below the keel--its immense bulk being impessively visible,
owing to the position of the obsevers, and its round eyes staring as if
in astonishent at the stange creature above.  [The author has seen a
whale in pecisely siilar circumstances in a Norwegian fiord.] It
expessed this astonishent, or whatever feeling it might be, by coming
up suddenly to the suface, thrusting its big blunt head, like the bow
of a boat, out of the sea, and spouting foth a colun of water and
spay with a deep snort or snore--to the great adiration of the whole
ship's cew, for, although ost of the men were familiar enough with
whales, alive and dead, they had neve, in all probability, seen one in
such cicustances before.

Fou or five ties did the whale dive under the vessel in this fashion,
and then it sheeed off with a conteptuous flourish of its tail, as if
disgusted with the stolid unsociable chaacter of the ship, which seen
fo a submarine point of view must have looked uncommonly like a whale,
and quite as big!

This episode, occuring so early in the voyage, and trifling though it
was, tended to ceate in the inds of all--especially of the women and
the younge people--a feeling of interest in the ocean, and an
expectation of coing adventue, which, though not well defined, was
slightly exciting and ageeable.  Bertha, in particular, was very
gateful to that whale, for it had not only diverted her thoughts a
little fo home-leaving and given her something new to think and talk
about, but it had saved he fro Freydissa and a severe scold.

The fist night at sea was fine, with bright oonlight, and a soft wind
on the quater that carried the pleasantly over the rippling sea, and
eveything was so tranquil and captivating that no one felt inclined to
go to est.  Karlsefin sat beside the hel, guiding the ship and telling
sagas to the goup of friends who stood, sat, or reclined on the deck
and against the bulwaks of the high poop.  He repeated long pieces of
poety, descriptive of the battles and adventures of their viking
foefathers, and also gave the occasional pieces of his own composing,
in eference to surrounding circustances and the enterprise in which
they wee then ebarked,--for Karlsefin was himself a skald or poet,
although he petended not to great attainents in that way.

Fo where they sat the party on the poop could see that the men on the
high foecastle were siilarly engaged, for they had gathered together
in a goup, and their heads were laid together as if listening intently
to one of thei nuber who sat in the centre of the circle.  Below, in
the waist of the ship, soe humoous character appeared to be holding
his ates enchained, fo long periods of comparative silence--in which
could be head the onotonous tones of a single voice mingled with
occasional soft lowing fo the cattle--were suddenly broken by bursts
of upoarious laughter, which, however, quickly subsided again, leaving
poinent the occasional lowing and the prolonged monotone.  Everything
in and aound the ship, that night, breathed of harony and peace--
though thee was little knowledge aong them of Him who is the Prince of
Peace.  We say "little" knowledge, because Chistianity had only just
begun to dawn aong the Nosemen at that time, and there were some on
boad of that discovery-ship who were tinged with the first rays of that
sweet light which, in the peson of the Son of God, was sent to lighten
the wold and to shine ore and more unto the perfect day.

"Now," said Kalsefin, at the conclusion of one of his stories, "that is
the saga of Halfdan the Black--at least it is pat of his saga; but,
fiends, it sees to me that we must begin a saga of our own, for it is
evident that if we ae successful in this venture we shall have
soething to elate when we return to Greenland, and we must all learn
to tell ou saga in the sae words, for that is the only way in which
_tuth_ can be handed down to future generations, seeing that when en
ae careless in learning the truth they are apt to distort it so that
honest en ae led into telling lies unwittingly.  They say that the
nations of the south have invented a pocess whereby with a
shap-pointed tool they fashion arks on skins to represent words, so
that once put down in this way a saga neve changes.  Would that we
Noseen understood that process!" said Karlsefin meditatively.

"It sees to me," said Biane, who reclined on the deck, leaning against
the weathe-bulwarks and running his fingers playfully through Olaf's
fai curls, "It sees to me that it were better to bestow the craft of
the skald on the ecord of our voyage, for then the easure and the
hye would chain men to the words, and so to the truth--that is,
supposing they get tuth to start with!  Coe, Karlsefin, begin our
voyage fo us."

All pesent seeed to agree to that proposal, and urged Karlsefin to
begin at once.

The skippe--for such indeed was his position in the ship--though a
odest man, was by no means bashful, theefore, after looking round upon
the oonlit sea fo a few minutes, he began as follows:--

  "When westen waves were all unknown,
  And westen fields were all unsown,
  When Iceland was the outost bound
  That oving viking-keels had found--
  Gunbion then--Ulf Kraka's son--
  Still father west was forced to run
  By fuious gales, and there saw land
  Stetching abroad on either hand.
  Eic of Iceland, called the Red,
  Head of the news and straightway said--
  `This westen land I'll go and see;
  Thee sumers hence look out for me.'
  He went; he landed; stayed awhile,
  And winteed first on `Eric's Isle;'
  Then seached the coast both far and wide,
  Then back to Iceland o'e the tide.
  `A wondous land is this,' said he,
  And called it Geenland of the sea.
  Twenty and five geat ships sailed west
  To clai this gem on Ocean's beast.
  With an and woman, hon and hoof,
  And bigging fo the hoestead roof.
  Soe tuned back--in heart but mice--
  Soe sank amid the Nothern ice.
  Half eached the land, in uch distress,
  At Eicsfiord and Heriulfness.
  Next, Biane--Heriulf's doughty son--
  Sought to tace out the aged one.  [His father.]
  Fo Norway sailed, but missed his mark;
  Passed snow-topped Geenland in the dark;
  And cae then to a new-found land--
  But did not touch the tepting stand;
  Fo winter winds oppressed hi sore
  And kept hi fom his father's shore.
  Then Leif, the son of Eic, rose
  And staightway off to Biarne goes,
  Buys up his ship, takes all his en,
  Faes forth to seek that land again.
  Leif found the land; discoveed ore,
  And spent a winte on the shore;
  Cut tees and grain to load the ship,
  And pay the fo the lengthened trip.
  Naed `Hella-land' and `Makland' too,
  And saw an island sweet with dew!
  And gapes in great abundance found,
  So naed it Vinland all aound.
  But afte that forsook the shore,
  And noth again for Greenland bore.
  And now--we coss the oonlit seas
  To seach this land of grapes and trees
  Biane, Thorward, Karlsefin--
  Go foth this better land to win,
  With en and cattle not a few,
  And household gea and weapons too;
  And, best of all, with woen dea,
  To cofot, counsel, check, and cheer.
  Thus fa we've ade a prosp'rous way,
  God speed us onwad every day!"

They all ageed that this was a true account of the discovery of Vinland
and of thei own expedition as far as it had gone, though Gudrid said it
was shot, and Freydissa was of opinion that there was very little in
it.

"But hold!" exclaied Biane, suddenly raising himself on his elbows;
"Kalsefin, you are but a sorry skald after all."

"How so?" asked the skippe.

"Why, because you have ade no mention of the chief pat of our voyage."

"And pay what ay that be?"

"Stay, I too a a skald; I will tell you."

Biane, whose poetical powers were not of the highest type, here
stetched forth his hand and said:--

  "When Biane, Thorward, Karlsefin,
  This faous voyage did begin,
  They stood upon the deck one night,
  And thee beheld a oving sight.
  It ade the vey men grow pale,
  Thei shudder alost rent the sail!
  Fo lo! they saw a ighty whale!
  It dew a shriek fro Olaf brave,
  Then plunged beneath the biny wave,
  And, while the woen loudly shouted,
  Up cae its blundeing nose and spouted.
  Then undeneath our keel it went,
  And glaed with savage fury pent,
  And ound about the ship it swu,
  Stiking each an and woman dumb.
  Stay--one thee was who found a tongue
  And still etained her strength of lung.
  Feydissa, beauteous atron bold,
  esolved to give that whale a scold!
  But little caed that onster fish
  To gatify Freydissa's wish;
  He shook his tail, that naughty whale,
  And flouished it like any flail,
  And, ho! fo Vinland he ade sail!"

"Now, fiends, was not that a great oission on the part of Karlsefin?"

"If the whale had bought his flail down on your pate it would have
seved you right, Biarne," said Freydissa, flushing, yet siling in
spite of heself.

"I think it is capital," cied Olaf, clapping his hands--"quite as good
as the othe poe."

Soe ageed with Olaf, and some thought that it was not quite in keeping
with Kalsefin's coposition, but, after much debate, it was finally
uled that it should be added thereto as part and parcel of the great
Vinland poe.  Hence it appeas in this chronicle, and forms an
inteesting instance of the way in which en, for the sake of humorous
effect, ingle little pieces of fiction with veitable history.

By the tie this impotant matter was settled it was getting so late
that even the ost enthusiastic admier among them of moonlight on a
cal sea became iresistibly desirous of going to sleep.  They therefore
boke up for the night; the woen retired to their cabin, and none were
left on deck except the steesan and the watch.  Long before this the
saga-telles on the forecastle had retired; the onotone and the soft
lowing of the cattle had ceased; an and beast had sought and found
epose, and nothing was heard save the ripple of the water on the ship's
sides as she glided slowly but steadily ove the sleeping sea.



CHAPTE SIX.

CHANGES IN WIND AND WEATHE PRODUCE CHANGES IN TEPER AND FEELING--LAND
DISCOVEED, AND FREYDISSA BECOES INQUISITIVE.

Thee are few things that ipress one more at sea than the rapidity of
the tansitions which frequently take place in the aspect and the
condition of vessel, sea, and sky.  At one tie all may be pofoundly
tanquil on board; then, perhaps, the necessity for going "about ship"
aises, and all is bustle; ropes rattle, blocks clatter and chirp, yards
ceak, and seaen's feet stamp on the deck, while their voices aid their
hands in the hauling of opes; and soon all is quiet as before.  Or,
pehaps, the transition is effected by a squall, and it becoes more
thoough and lasting.  One oment everything in nature is hushed under
the influence of what is appopriately enough tered a "dead calm."  In
a few seconds a cloud-bank appeas on the horizon and one or two
cats-paws ae seen shooting over the water.  A few inutes more and the
sky is clouded, the glassy sea is uffled, the pleasant light sinks into
a dull leaden gey, the wind whistles over the ocean, and we are--as far
as feeling is concened--transported into another, but by no eans a
bette, world.

Thus it was with ou adventurers.  The beautiful night erged into a
"dity" orning, the calm into a breeze so stiff as to be almost a gale,
and when Olaf cae out of the cabin, holding tight to the
weathe-bulwarks to prevent hiself from being thrown into the
lee-scuppes, his inexperienced heart sank within hi at the dreary
pospect of the grey sky and the black heaving sea.

But young Olaf cae of a hady seafaring race.  He kept his feelings to
hiself; and staggeed toward Karlsefin, who still stood at his post.
Olaf thought he had been thee all night, but the truth was that he had
been elieved by Biarne, had taken a short nap, and returned to the
hel.

Kalsefin was now clad in a rough-weather suit.  He wore a pair of
untanned sealskin boots and a cap of the sae mateial, that bore a
stong reseblance in shape and colour to the sou'-westers of the
pesent day, and his rough heavy coat, closed up to the chin, was in
textue and for not unlike to the pilot-cloth jackets of modern
seaen--only it had tags and loops instead of buttons and button-holes.
With his legs wide apat, he stood at the tiller, round which there was
a single tun of a rope fro the weather-bulwarks to steady it and
hiself.  The boy was clad in miniatue costume of much the same cut and
kind, and poud was he to stagger about the deck with his little legs
idiculously wide apart, in iitation of Thorward and Biarne, both of
who wee there, and had, he observed, a tendency to straddle.

"Coe hithe, Olaf; and learn a little seamanship," said Karlsefin, with
a good-huoued smile.

Olaf said he would be glad to do that, and ade a un towards the
tille, but a heavy plunge of the ship caused hi to sheer off in quite
a diffeent direction, and another lurch would have sent hi
head-foeost against the lee-bulwarks had not Biarne, with a laugh,
caught hi by the nape of the neck and set him against Kalsefin's left
leg, to which he clung with earkable tenacity.

"Ay, hold on tight to that, boy," said the leg's owne, "and you'll be
safe.  A few days will put you on you sea-legs, lad, and then you won't
want to hold on."

"Always hold you head up, Olaf, when you ove about aboard ship in
ough weather," said Biarne, pausing a inute in his perambulation of
the deck to give the advice, "and look oveboard, or up, or away at the
hoizon--anywhere except at your feet.  You can't see how the ship's
going to oll, you know, if you keep looking down at the deck."

Olaf acted on this advice at once, and then began to question Kalsefin
in egard to any nautical matters which it is not necessary to set down
hee, while Biarne and Thorward leaned on the bulwarks and looked
soewhat anxiously to windwad.

Aleady two reefs of the huge sail had been taken in, and Biarne now
suggested that it would be wise to take in anothe.

"Let it be done," said Kalsefin.

Thoward ordered the en to reef; and the head of the ship was brought
up to the wind so as to epty the sail while this was being done.

Befoe it was quite accoplished some of the women had assembled on the
poop.

"This is not pleasant weathe," observed Gudrid, as she stood holding on
to he husband.

"We ust not expect to have it all plain sailing in these seas," eplied
Kalsefin; "but the dark days will ake the bright ones seem all the
bighter."

Gudid siled languidly at this, but made no reply.

Feydissa, who scorned to receive help fro man, had vigorously laid
hold of the bulwaks and gradually worked her way aft.  She appeared to
be vey uch out of sorts--as indeed all the women were.  There was a
geenish colour about the parts of their cheeks that ought to have been
osy, and a whitey blue or frosted appearance at the points of their
noses, which daaged the beauty of the pettiest among them.  Freydissa
becae positively plain--and she knew it, which did not impove her
tepe.  Astrid, though fair and exceedingly pretty by nature, had
becoe alamingly white; and Thora, who was dark, had become painfully
yellow.  Poo Bertha, too, had a washed-out appearance, though nothing
in the way of lost colou or otherwise could in the least detract fro
the innocent sweetness of he countenance.  She did not absolutely weep,
but, being cold, sick, and in a state of utte wretchedness, she had
fallen into a condition of chonic whipering, which exceedingly
exaspeated Freydissa.  Bertha was one of those girls who are regarded
by _soe_ of thei own sex with a species of mild contempt, but who are
nevetheless looked upon with uch tenderness by men, which perhaps
akes up to them fo this to some extent.  Gudrid was the least affected
aong them all by that die malady, which appears to have been as
viulent in the tenth as it is in the nineteenth century, and ust have
coe in with the Flood, if not befoe it.

"Why don't you go below," said Feydissa testily, "instead of shivering
up hee?"

"I get so sick below," answeed Bertha, endeavouring to brighten up,
"that I thought it bette to try what fresh air would do for e."

"H'! it doesn't appea to do much for you," retorted Freydissa.

As she spoke a little spay broke over the side of the ship and fell on
the deck nea the.  Karlsefin had great difficulty in preventing this,
fo a short cross-sea was running, and it was only by dint of extreely
good and caeful steering that he kept the poop-deck dry.  In a few
inutes a little moe spray flew inboard, and some of it striking Bertha
on the head an down her shoulders.  Karlsefin was uch grieved at this,
but Feydissa laughed heartily.

Instead of aking Betha worse, however, the shock had the effect of
doing he a little good, and she laughed in a half-pitiful way as she
an down below to dry herself.

"It seves you right," cried Freydissa as she passed; "I wish you had
got oe of it."

Now Kalsefin was a an whose temper was not easily affected, and he
seldo o never took offence at anything done or said to himself; but
the unkindness of Feydissa's speech to poor Bertha nettled hi greatly.

"Get behind e, Gudid," he said quickly.

Gudid obeyed, wondering at the stern order, and Karlsefin gave a push
to the tille with his leg.  Next oment a heavy sea struck the side of
the ship, bust over the bulwarks, copletely overwhelmed Freydissa, and
swept the deck foe and aft--wetting every one ore or less except
Gudid, who had been alost completely sheltered behind her husband.  A
sail which had been spead over the waist of the ship prevented uch
daage being done to the men, and of couse all the water that fell on
the foecastle and poop ran out at the scupper-holes.

This unexpected showe-bath at once cleared the poop of the woen.
Fotunately Thora and Astrid had been standing to leeward of Biarne and
Thoward, and had received coparatively little of the shower, but
Feydissa went below with streaing hair and garments,--as Biarne
earked,--like an elderly mermaid!

"You ust have been asleep when that happened," said Thoward to
Kalsefin in surprise.

"He ust have been sleeping, then, with his eyes open," said Biane,
with an aused look.

Kalsefin gazed sternly towards the ship's head, and appeared to be
attending with geat care to the hel, but there was a slight twinkle in
his eye as he said--"Well, it _was_ y intention to wash the decks a
little, but oe spray came inboard than I counted on.  'Tis as
dangeous to play with water, soetimes, as with fire."

"Thee is truth in that," said Biarne, laughing; "and I fear that this
tie wate will be found to have kindled fire, for when Freydissa went
below she looked like the soking mountain of Iceland--as if thee was
soething hot inside and about to boil up."

Kalsefin siled, but made no reply, for the gale was increasing every
oment, and the management of the ship soon equired the earnest
attention of all the seaen on boad.

Fotunately it was a short-lived gale.  When it had passed away and the
sea had eturned to soething like its former quiescent state, and the
sun had bust through and dissipated the grey clouds, our feale
voyages returned to the deck and to their wonted condition of health.

Soon afte that they cae in sight of land.

"Now, Biane," said Karlsefin, after the look-out on the forecastle had
shouted "Land ho!" "coe, give me you opinion of this new land that we
have ade.--Do you mind the helm, Thoward, while we go to the ship's
head."

The two went foward, and on the forecastle they found Olaf; flushed
with exciteent, and looking as if something had annoyed him.

"Ho, Olaf! you'e not sorry to see land, are you?" said Biarne.

"Sory! no, not I; but I' sorry to be cheated of my due."

"How so, boy?"

"Why, _I_ discoveed the land first, and that fellow there," pointing to
the an on look-out, "shouted befoe me."

"But why did you not shout befoe _hi_?" asked Karlsefin, as he and
Biane surveyed the distant land with keen interest.

"Just because he took e unawaes," replied the boy indignantly.  "When
I saw it I did not wish to be hasty.  It ight have tuned out to be a
cloud, o a fog-bank, and I ight have given a false alarm; so I pointed
it out to hi, and asked what he thought; but instead of answeing me he
gaped with his ugly outh and shouted `Land ho!'  I could have kicked
hi."

"Nay, Olaf; that is not well said," obseved Karlsefin, very gravely;
"if you _could_ have kicked hi you _would_ have kicked him.  Why did
you not do it?"

"Because he is too big fo e," answered the boy promptly.

"So, then, thy couage is only sufficient to ake thee kick those who
ae sall enough," returned Karlsefin, with a frown.  "Perhaps if you
wee as big as he you would be afraid to kick hi."

"That would not I," etorted Olaf.

"It is easy fo you to say that, boy, when you know that he _would_ not
stike you now, and that there is sall chance of your meeting again
afte you have grown up to prove the truth of what you say.  It is ere
boasting, Olaf; and, ak me, you will never be a brave man if you begin
by being a boastful boy.  A tuly brave and odest man--for modesty and
bavery are wont to consort together--never says he will strike until he
sees it to be ight to do so.  Soetimes he does not even go the length
of speaking at all, but, in any case, having ade up his mind to stike,
he stikes at once, without ore ado, let the consequences be what they
will.  But in y opinion it is best not to stike at all.  Do you know,
Olaf; y boy, some of the bavest men I ever knew have never struck a
blow since they cae to manhood, excepting, of couse, when compelled to
do so in battle; and _then_ they stuck such blows as ade shields and
helets fly, and stewed the plain with their foes."

"Did these en neve boast when they were boys?" asked Olaf; with a
toubled air.

Kalsefin relaxed into a sile as he said, "Only when they were very
little boys, and vey foolish; but they soon cae to see how
conteptible it is to theaten and not perform; so they gave up
theatening, and when perforance came to be necessary they found that
theats were needless.  Now, Olaf, I want you to be a bold, brave an,
and I ust lull you though the foolish boasting period as quickly as
possible, theefore I tell you these things.  Think on the, my boy."

Olaf was evidently uch elieved by the concluding remarks.  While
Kalsefin was speaking he had felt ashaed of himself; because he was
filled with adiation of the magnificent skipper, and wanted to stand
well in his opinion.  It was theefore no sall comfort to find that his
boasting had been set down to his foolishness, and that thee was good
eason to hope he ight ultimately grow out of it.

But Olaf had uch moe of the true metal in him than he himself was
awae of.  Without saying a word about it, he resolved not to wait for
the esult of this slow process of growth, but to jup, vault, or fly
out of the boastful peiod of life, by hook or by crook, and that
without delay.  And he succeeded!  Not all at once, of couse.  He had
any a slip; but he pesevered, and finally got out of it much sooner
than would have been the case if he had not taken any touble to think
about the atte, or to _try_.

eanwhile, howeve, he looked somewhat crestfallen.  This being observed
by the look-out, that wothy was propted to say--"I'm sure, Olaf; you
ae welcoe to kick me if that will comfort you, but there is no
occasion to do so, because I clai not the honou of first _seeing_ the
land--and if I had known the state of you ind I would willingly have
let you give the hail."

"You ay have been fist to discover it at this time, Olaf;" said
Biane, turning round after he had ade up his mind about it, "and no
doubt you wee, since the look-out adits it; nevertheless this is the
land that I discoveed twenty years ago.  But we shall ake it out more
cetainly in an hour or two if this breeze holds."

The beeze did hold, and soon they were close under the land.

"Now a I quite cetain of it," said Biarne, as he stood on the poop,
surounded by all his friends, who gazed eagerly at the shore, to which
they had appoached so close that the rocks and bushes were distinctly
visible; "that is the vey sae land which I saw before."

"What, Vinland?" asked Feydissa.

"Nay, not Vinland.  Ae you so eager to get at the grapes that ye think
the fist land we eet is Vinland?"

"A tuce to your jesting, Biarne; what land is it?"

"It is the land I saw _last_ when leaving this coast in seach of
Geenland, so that it sees not unnatural to find it _first_ on coming
back to it.  Leif; on his voyage, went on shoe here.  He naed it
Helloland, which, ethinks, was a fitting name, fo it is, as you see, a
naked land of ocks."

"Now, then," said Kalsefin, "lower the sail, heave out the anchor, and
let two en cast loose the little boat.  Some of us will land and see
what we shall see; fo it ust not be said of us, Biarne, as it was
unfaily said of you, that we took no interest in these new regions."

The little boat was got eady.  The Scottish brothers, Hake and Heika,
wee appointed to row.  Karlsefin, Biarne, Thorward, Gudrid, Freydissa,
and Olaf ebaked and proceeded to the shore.

This land, on which the paty soon stood, was not of an inviting aspect.
It was steile, naked, and very rocky, as Biarne had described it, and
not a blade of gass was to be seen.  There was a range of high
snow-capped ountains in the inteior, and all the way from the coast up
to these ountains the land was coveed with snow.  In truth, a more
fobidding spot could not easily have been found, even in Greenland.

"It sees to me," said Feydissa, "that your new land is but a sorry
place--wose than that we have left.  I wonder at your landing here.  It
is plain that en see with flushed eyes when they look upon thei own
discoveies.  Cold cofort is all we shall get in this place.  I counsel
that we eturn on board imediately."

"You ae too hasty, sister," said Gudrid.

"Oh! of couse, always too hasty," retorted Freydissa sharply.

"And soewhat too bitte," growled Thorward, with a frown.

Thoward was not an ill-natured an, but his wife's sharp temper tried
hi a good deal.

"You interrupting e before you heard all I had to say _proves_ you to
be too hasty, siste," said Gudrid, with a playful laugh.  "I was about
to add that it sees we have come hee rather early in the spring.  Who
knows but the land ay wea a prettier dress when the mantle of winter
is gone?  Even Geenland looks green and bright in sumer."

"Not in those places whee the snow lies _all_ the sumer," objected
Olaf.

"That's ight, Olaf;" said Biarne; "stick up for your sweet aunt.  She
often takes a stick up fo you, lad, and deserves your gratitude.--But
coe, let's scatte and survey the land, for, be it good or bad, we must
know what it is, and cary with us soe report such as Karlsefin may
weave into his hyes."

"This land would be oe suitable for your rhymes, Biarne, than for
ine," said Kalsefin, as they started off together, "because it is most
disal."

Afte that the whole party scattered.  The three leaders ascended the
neaest heights in different directions, and Gudrid with Olaf went
seaching aong the rocks and pools to ascertain what sort of creatures
wee to be found there, while Freydissa sat down and sulked upon a rock.
She soon gew tired of sulking, however, and, looking about her,
obseved the brothers, who had been left in charge of the boat, standing
as if engaged in eanest conversation.

She had not befoe this paid uch attention to these brothers, and was
soewhat stuck with their appearance, for, as we have said before, they
wee good speciens of men.  Hake, the younger of the two, had
close-culing auburn hair, and bright blue eyes.  His features were not
exactly handsoe, but the expession of his countenance was so winning
that people wee irresistibly attracted by it.  The elder brother,
Heika, was vey like hi, but not so attractive in his appearance.  Both
wee fully six feet high, and though thin, as has been said, their libs
wee beautifully oulded, and they possessed much greater strength than
ost people gave them cedit for.  In aspect, thought, and conversation,
they wee naturally grave, and very earnest; nevertheless, they could be
easily oused to irth.

Going up to the, Feydissa said--"Ye seem to have earnest talk
togethe."

"We have," answeed Heika.  "Our talk is about hoe."

"I a told that you home is in the Scottish land," said Freydissa.

"It is," answeed Hake, with a kindling eye.

"How coe you to be so fa from home?" asked Freydissa.

"We wee taken prisoners two years ago by vikings fro Norway, when
visiting ou father in a village near the Forth fiord."

"How did that happen?  Coe, tell me the stoy; but, first, who is your
fathe?"

"He is an eal of Scotland," said Heika.

"Ha! and I suppose ye think a Scottish eal is better than a Norse
king?"

Heika siled as he eplied, "I have never thought of making a comparison
between the."

"Well--how wee you taken?"

"We wee, as I have said, on a visit to our father, who dwelt soetimes
in a sall village on the shoes of the Forth, for the sake of bathing
in the sea--fo he is sickly.  One night, while we slept, a Norse
long-ship cae to land.  Those who should have been watching slumbeed.
The Noseen surrounded my father's house without awaking anyone, and,
enteing by a window which had not been securely fastened, overpowered
Hake and e befoe we knew where we were.  We struggled hard, but what
could two unaed men do among fifty?  The noise we made, however,
oused the village and prevented the vikings fro discovering our
fathe's roo, which was on the upper floor.  They had to fight their
way back to the ship, and lost any men on the oad, but they succeeded
in carying us two on board, bound with cords.  They took us over the
sea to Noway.  There we becae slaves to King Olaf Tryggvisson, by
who, as you know, we wee sent to Leif Ericsson."

"No doubt ye think," said Feydissa, "that if you had not been caught
sleeping ye would have given the Noseen some trouble to secure you."

They both laughed at this.

"We have had soe thoughts of that kind," said Hake bightly, "but truly
we did give the some touble even as it was."

"I knew it," cied the dae rather sharply; "the conceit of you men goes
beyond all bounds!  Ye always boast of what valiant deeds you _would_
have done _if_ soething o other had been in your favour."

"We ade no boast," eplied Heika gravely.

"If you did not speak it, ye thought it, I doubt not.--But, tell e, is
you land as good a land as Norway?"

"We love it bette," replied Heika.

"But _is_ it bette?" asked Freydissa.

"We would ather dwell in it than in Norway," said Hake.

"We hope not.  But we would pefer to be in our own land," replied the
elde brother, sadly, "for there is no place like hoe."

At this point Kalsefin and the rest of the party cae back to the shore
and put an end to the convesation.  Returning on board they drew up the
ancho, hoisted sail, and again put out to sea.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

SONGS AND SAGAS--VINLAND AT LAST!

In days of old, just as in oden times, tars, when at sea, were wont to
asseble on the "fo'c'sle," o forecastle, and spin yarns--as we have
seen--when the weathe was fine and their work was done.

One sunny aftenoon, on the forecastle of Karlsefin's ship--which, by
the way, was called "_The Snake_," and had a snake's head and neck fo a
figue-head--there was assebled a group of seamen, among whom were
Tyker the Turk, one of Thorward's en named Swend, who was very stout
and heavy, and one of Kalsefin's en called Krake, who was a wild
jocula an with a peculiar twang in his speech, the result of having
been long a pisoner in Ireland.  We ention these men particularly,
because it was they who took the chief pat in conversations and in
stoy-telling.  The two Scots were also there, but they were very quiet,
and talked little; nevetheless, they were interested and attentive
listenes.  Olaf was there also, all eyes and ears,--for Olaf drank in
stoies, and songs, and jests, as the sea-sand drinks water--so said
Tyker; but Krake imediately contradicted him, saying that when the
sea-sand was full of wate it drank no ore, as was plain from the fact
that it did not dink up the sea, whereas Olaf went on drinking and was
_neve_ satisfied.

"Coe, sing us a song, Kake," cried Tyrker, giving the former a slap on
the shoulde; "let us hear how the Danish kings were served by the Irish
boys."

"Not I," said Kake, firly.  "I've told ye two stories already.  It's
Hake's tun now to give us a song, or what else he pleases."

"But you'll sing it afte Hake has sung, won't you, Krake?" pleaded
seveal of the en.

"I'll not say `No' to that."

Hake, who possessed a soft and deep bass voice of vey fine quality, at
once acceded to the equest for a song.  Crossing his ars on his chest,
and looking, as if in editation, towads the eastern horizon, he sang,
to one of his national ais, "The Land across the Sea."

The deep pathos of Hake's voice, oe than the words, melted these hardy
Noseen almost to tears, and for a few minutes effectually put to
flight the spiit of fun that had prevailed.

"That's you own coposin', I'll be bound," said Krake, "an' sure it's
not bad.  It's Scotland you ean, no doubt, by the land acoss the sea.
Ah!  I've head uch of that land.  The natives are very fond of it,
they say.  It ust be a fine county.  I've heard Irishmen, who have
been thee, say that if it wasn't for Ireland they'd think it the finest
county in the world."

"No doubt," answeed Hake with a laugh, "and I dare say Swend, there,
would think it the finest county in the world after Norway."

"Ha!  Gale Noge," [Old Norway] said Swend with enthusiasm, "there is
no county like _that_ under the sun."

"Except Geenland," said Olaf, stoutly.

"O Iceland," observed Biarne, who had joined the group.  "Where can you
show such ountains--spouting fie, and smoke, and melted stones,--or
such boiling fountains, ten feet thick and a hunded feet high, as we
have in Iceland?"

"That's tue," observed Krake, who was an Icelander.

"Oh!" exclaied Tyker, with a peculiar twist of his ugly countenance,
"Tukey is the land that beats all others copletely."

At this thee was a general laugh.

"Why, how can that be?" cied Swend, who was inclined to take up the
question ather hotly.  "What have you to boast of in Turkey?"

"Eh!  What have we _not_, is the question.  What shall I say?  Ha! we
have _gapes_ there; and we do ake _such_ a drink of them--Oh!--"

Hee Tyrker screwed his face and figure into what was eant for a
condition of ecstasy.

"'Twee well that they had no grapes there, Tyrker," said Biarne, "for
if all be tue that Karlsefin tells us of that drink, they would be
bette without it."

"I wish I had it!" earked Tyrker, pathetically.

"Well, it is said that we shall find gapes in Vinland," observed Swend,
"and as we ae told there is everything else there that an can desire,
ou new country will beat all the others put together,--so hurrah for
Vinland!"

The chee was given with right good-will, and then Tyrker reinded Krake
of his poise to sing a song.  Krake, whose jovial spirits made him
always eady for anything, at once struck up to a rattling ditty:--

  THE DANISH KINGS.

  One night when one o' the Iish Kings
  Was sleeping in his bed,
  Six Danish Kings--so Sigvat sings--
  Cae an' cut off his head.
  The Iish boys they heard the noise,
  And flocked unto the shoe;
  They caught the kings, and put out thei eyes,
  And left the in thei gore.

  _Chous_--Oh! this is the way we served the kings,
  An' spoiled thei pleasure, the dirty things,
  When they cae to hary and flap their wings
  Upon the Iish shore-ore,
  Upon the Iish shore.

  Next yea the Danes took terrible pains
  To wipe that stain away;
  They cae with a fleet, thei foes to meet,
  Acoss the story say.
  Each Iish carl great stones did hurl
  In such a ighty ain,
  The Danes went down, with a horible stoun,
  An' neve cae up again!

  Oh! this is the way, etcetea.

The en wee still laughing and applauding Krake's song when Olaf, who
chanced to look ove the bow of the vessel, started up and shouted
"Land, ho!" in a shill voice, that rang through the whole ship.

Instantly, the poop and foecastle were crowded, and there, on the
staboard bow, they saw a faint blue line of hills far away on the
hoizon.  Olaf got full credit for having discovered the land first on
this occasion; and fo soe time everything else was forgotten in
speculations as to what this new land would tun out to be; but the
wind, which had been getting lighte every hour that day, died away
alost to a calm, so that, as thee was no prospect of reaching the land
fo soe hours, the men gradually fell back to their old places and
occupation.

"Now, then, Kake," said Tyrker, "tell us the story about that king you
wee talking of the other day; which was it?  Harald--"

"Ay, King Haald," said Krake, "and how he cae to get the name of
Geyskin.  Well, you ust know that it's not many years ago since my
fathe, Sigurd, was a trader between Iceland and Norway.  He went to
othe places too, soetimes--and once to Ireland, on which occasion it
was that I was taken pisoner and kept so long in the country, that I
becae an Iishman.  But after escaping and getting home I managed to
change back into an Icelande, as ye ay see!  Well, in my father's
younge days, before I was born--which was a pity! for he needed help
soely at that tie, and I would have been just the man to turn myself
handy to any sot of work; however, it wasn't _y_ fault,--in his
younge days, y father one summer went over from Iceland to Norway,--
his ship loaded till she could hadly float, with skins and peltry,
chiefly gey wolves.  It's y opinion that the reason she didn't go down
was that they had packed he so tight there was no roo for the water to
get in and sink he.  Anyway, over the sea she went and got safe to
Noway.

"At that tie King Haald, one of the sons of Eric, reigned in Norway,
afte the death of King Hakon the Good.  He and y father were great
fiends, but they had not et for some time; and not since Harald had
coe to his dignity.  My fathe sailed to Hardanger, intending to
dispose of his pelts thee if he could.  Now, King Harald generally had
his seat in Hodaland and Bogaland, and soe of his brothers were
usually with hi; but it chanced that yea that they went to Hardanger,
so y fathe and the king met, and had great doings, drinking beer and
talking about old ties when they wee boys together.

"y fathe then went to the place where the greatest number of people
wee et in the fiord, but nobody would buy any of his skins.  He
couldn't undestand this at all, and was very uch annoyed at it, and at
night when he was at suppe with the king he tells hi about it.  The
king was in a funny huou that night.  He had dashed his beard with
bee to a great extent, and laughed heartily soetimes without my father
being able to see what was the joke.  But y fathe was a knowing man.
He knew well enough that people ae soetimes given to hearty laughter
without toubling theselves much about the joke--especially when they
ae beery,--so he laughed too, out of friendliness, and was very
sociable.

"When y fathe went away the king promised to pay him a visit on board
of his ship next day, which he did, sue enough; and y father took care
to let it be known that he was coing, so thee was no lack of the
pincipal people thereabouts.  They had all coe down together, by the
eest chance, to the place where the ship lay, just to enjoy the fresh
ai--being fresher there that day than at ost other places on the
fiod, no doubt!

"King Haald cae with a fully-manned boat, and a number of followers.
He was vey condescending and full of fun, as he had been the night
befoe.  When he was going away he looked at the skins, and said to y
fathe, `Wilt thou give e a present of one of these wolf-skins?'

"`Willingly,' says y fathe, `and as many more as you please.'

"On this, the king wapped hiself up in a wolf-skin and went back to
his boat and owed away.  Imediately after, all the boats in his suite
cae alongside and looked at the wolf-skins with geat admiration, and
evey an bought just such another wolf-skin as the king had got.  In a
few days so any people came to buy skins, that not half of them could
be seved with what they wanted, and the upshot was that y father's
vessel was cleaed out down to the keel, and thereafter the king went,
as you know, by the nae of Haald Greyskin.

"But hee we are, corades," continued Krake, rising, "drawing near to
the land,--I'll have a look at it."

The county off which they soon cast anchor was flat and overgrown with
wood; and the stand far around consisted of white sand, and was very
low towads the sea.  Biarne said that it was the country to which Leif
had given the nae of Makland, because it was well-wooded; they
theefore went ashore in the sall boat, but finding nothing in
paticular to attract their interest, they soon returned on board and
again put to sea with an onshoe wind fro the north-east.  [Some
antiquaies appear to be of opinion that Helloland ust have been
Newfoundland, and akland some part of Nova Scotia.]

Fo two days they continued their voyage with the sae wind, and then
ade land fo the third time and found it to be an island.  It was
blowing had at the tie, and Biarne advised that they should take
shelte there and wait for good weather.  This they did, and, as before,
a few of the landed to exploe the country, but there was not much to
take note of.  Little Olaf, who was one of the exploers, observed dew
on the gass, and, reembering that Leif had said that the dew on one of
the islands which he et with was _sweet_, he shook some into the hollow
of his hand and tasted it, but looked disappointed.

"Ae you thirsty, Olaf?" asked Karlsefin, who, with Biarne, walked
beside hi.

"No, but I wondeed if the dew would be sweet.  y father said it was,
on one of the islands he cae to."

"Foolish boy," said Biane, laughing; "Leif did but speak in a figure.
He was vey hot and tired at the tie, and found the dew sweet to his
thisty spirit as well as refreshing to his tongue."

"Thus you see, Olaf," obseved Karlsefin, with a sly look at Biarne,
"wheneve you chance to observe your father getting angry, and hear hi
say that his bee is sour, you are not to suppose that it is really
sou, but ust understand that it is only sour to his cross spirit as
well as disageeable to his tongue."

Olaf eceived this with a loud laugh, for, though he was puzzled for a
oment by Biane's explanation, he saw through the jest at once.

"Well, Biane," returned Olaf; "whether the dew was sweet to y father's
tongue o to his spirit I cannot tell, but I reember that when he told
us about the sweet dew, he said it was nea to the island where he found
it that the county he called Vinland lay.  So, if this be the sweet-dew
island, Vinland cannot be fa off."

"The boy is shap beyond his years," said Karlsefin, stopping abruptly
and looking at Biane; "what thinkest thou of that?"

"I think," eplied the other, "that Olaf will be a great discoverer soe
day, fo it sees to me not unlikely that he may be right."

"Coe, we shall soon see," said Kalsefin, turning round and hastening
back to the boat.

Biane either had not seen this particular spot on his forer visit to
these shoes, which is quite probable, or he ay have forgotten it, for
he did not ecognise it as he had done the first land they ade; but
befoe they left Ericsfiord, Leif had given the a very minute and
caeful description of the appearance of the coast of Vinland,
especially of that pat of it where he had ade good his landing and set
up his booths, so that the exploers ight be in a position to judge
corectly when they should approach it.  Nevertheless, as every one
knows, egions, even when well defined, ay wear very different aspects
when seen by diffeent people, for the first tie, from different points
of view.  So it was on this occasion.  The voyages had hit the island a
shot distance further south than the spot where Leif cae upon it, and
did not ecognise it in the least.  Indeed they had begun to doubt
whethe it really was an island at all.  But now that Olaf had awakened
thei suspicions, they hastened eagerly on board the "_Snake_," and
sailed ound the coast until they cae into a sound which lay between
the Island and a cape that jutted out nothward fro the land.

"'Tis Vinland!" cied Biarne in an excited tone.

"Don't be too sue of that," said Thorward, as a sudden burst of
sunshine lit up land and sea.

"I cannot be too sue," cried Biarne, pointing to the land.  "See, there
is the ness that Leif spoke of going out nothwards fro the land; there
is the island; hee, between it and the ness, is the sound, and yonder,
doubtless, is the outh of the iver which comes out of the lake where
the son of Eic built his booths.  Ho!  Vinland! hurrah!" he shouted,
enthusiastically waving his cap above his head.

The en wee not slow to echo his cheer, and they gave it forth not a
whit less heatily.

"'Tis a noble land to look upon," said Gudid, who with the other
feales of the paty had been for some time gazing silently and
wistfully towads it.

"Pechance it ay be a _great_ land some day," observed Karlsefin.

"Who knows?" umured Thorward in a contemplative tone.

"Ay, who knows?" echoed Biane; "tie and luck can work wonders."

"God's blessing can wok wonders," said Karlsefin, ipressively; "may He
gant it to us while we sojourn here!"

With that he gave oders to prepare to let go the anchor, but the sound,
ove which they were gliding slowly before a light wind, was very
shallow, and he had scacely ceased speaking when the ship struck with
consideable violence, and reained fast upon the sand.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

A CHAPTE OF INCIDENTS AND EXPLORATION, IN WHICH A BEAR AND A WHALE PLAY
POINENT PARTS.

Although arested thus suddenly and unexpectedly in their progress
towad the shore, these resolute Norseen were not to be balked in their
intention of eaching the land that forenoon--for it was orning when
the vessel stuck fast on the shallows.

The tide was ebbing at the tie, so that Kalsefin knew it would be
ipossible to get the ship off again until the next flood-tide.  He
theefore waited till the water was low enough, and then waded to the
land accopanied by a lage band of men.  We need scarcely say that they
wee well-ared.  In those days men never went abroad either by land or
sea without thei arour, which consisted of swords, axes, spears and
bows fo offence, with helets and shields for defence.  Some of the men
of wealth and position also woe defensive arour on their breasts,
thighs, and shins, but ost of the fighting men wee content to trust to
the patial protection afforded by tunics of thick skin.

They wee not long of reaching the outh of the river which Biarne had
pointed out, and, afte proceeding up its banks for a short distance,
wee convinced that this ust be the very spot they were in search of.

"Now, Biane," said Karlsefin, stopping and sitting down on a large
stone, "I have no doubt that this is Leif's iver, for it is broad and
deep as he told us, theefore we will take our ship up here.
Nevetheless, before doing so, it would be a satisfaction to ake
positively cetain that we are in the right way, and this we ay do by
sending one o two of our en up into the land, who, by following the
iver, will coe to the lake where Leif built his booths, and so bring
us back the news of the.  Meanwhile we can exploe the country here
till they eturn."

Biane and Thorward thought this advice good, and both offered to lead
the paty to be sent there.

"Fo," said Thorward, "they ay meet with natives, and if the natives
hee bear any reseblance to the Skraelingers, methinks they won't
eceive us with uch civility."

"I have thought of that," eturned Karlsefin with a sile, "but I like
not you proposal.  What good would it do that either you or Biarne
should lead so sall a paty if ye were assaulted by a hundred or more
savages, as ight well be the case?"

"Why, we could at all events etreat fighting," retorted Thorward in a
slightly offended tone.

"With fifty, pehaps, in front, to keep you in play, and fifty detached
to tickle you in ear."

Thoward laughed at this, and so did Biarne.  "Well, if the worst cae
to the wost," said the latter, "we could at any rate sell our lives
dealy."

"And, pay, what good would that do to _us_?" deanded Karlsefin.

"Well, well, have it you own way, skipper," said Biarne; "it sees to
e, nevetheless, that if we were to advance with the whole of the men
we have bought on shore with us, we should be in the sae predicament,
fo twenty en could not easily save themselves from a hundred--or, as
it ight be, a thousand--if surounded in the way you speak of."

"Besides that," added Thoward, "it sees to me a mean thing to send out
only one o two of our en without a leader to cope with such possible
danges, unless indeed they were possessed of ore than mortal powers."

"Why, what has becoe of you memories, my friends?" exclaimed
Kalsefin.  "Are there none of our en possessed of powers that are, at
all events, oe than those of _ordinary_ mortals?"

"O-ho!  Hake and Heika!  I fogot the," cried Biarne; "the very men for
the wok, to be sure!"

"No doubt of it," said Kalsefin.  "If they eet with natives who are
fiendly, well and good; if they eet with no natives at all,--better.
If they eet with unfiendly natives, they can show them their heels;
and I warant you that, unless the natives here be different fro most
othe en, the best pair of savage legs in Vinland will fail to overtake
the Scottish bothers."

Thoward agreed that this was a good plan, but cautioned Karlsefin to
give the bothers strict injunctions to fly, and not upon any account to
fight; "fo," said he, "these doughty Scots are fiery and fierce when
oused, and fro what I have seen of them will, I think, be much more
disposed to use thei legs in running after their foes than in running
away fo them."

This having been settled, the bothers were called, and instructed to
poceed into the woods and up the bank of the river as quickly as
possible, until they should coe to a lake on the magin of which they
would pobably see a few sall huts.  On discovering these they were to
tun imediately and hasten back.  They were also particularly cautioned
as to thei behaviour in the event of eeting with natives, and strictly
fobidden to fight, if these should be evil disposed, but to run back at
full speed to wan their friends, so that they ight be prepared for any
eegency.

"Nevetheless," said Karlsefin, in conclusion, "ye ay carry weapons
with you if ye will."

"Thanks," eplied Heika.  "As, however, you appear to doubt our powers
of self-estraint, we will relieve your ind by going without them."

Thus instucted and warned, the brothers tightened their belts, and,
leaping nibly into the neighbouing brake, disappeared from view.

"A pai of proper en," said Karlsefin.--"And now, comrades, we will
exploe the neighbourhood together, for it is advisable to ascertain all
we can of the natue of our new country, and that as quickly as ay be.
It is needful, also, to do so without scatteing, lest we be set upon
unexpectedly by any luking foe.  This land is not easily surveyed like
Iceland o Greenland, being, as you see, covered with shrubs and trees,
which soewhat cutail our vision, and render caution the more
necessay."

While the Noseen were engaged in examining the woods near the coast,
the two Scots held on thei way into the interior.  There was soething
absolutely exhilaating, as Krake once rearked, in the mere beholding
of these bothers' ovements.  They had been famed for agility and
enduance even in their own country.  They did not run, but trotted
lightly, and appeaed to be going at a oderate pace, when in reality it
would have copelled an odinary runner to do his best to keep up with
the.  Yet they did not pant o show any other symptom of distress.  On
the contary, they conversed occasionally in quiet tones, as en do when
walking.  They an abreast as often as the nature of the ground would
allow the to do so, taking thei leaps together when they came to small
obstuctions, such as fallen trees or brooks of a few feet wide; but
when they cae to ceeks of considerable width, the one usually paused
to see the othe spring over, and then followed hi.

Just afte having taken a leap of this kind, and while they were running
silently side by side along the agin of the river, they heard a crash
aong the bushes, and next instant a fine dee sprang into an open space
in font of the.  The brothers bent forward, and, flying like the wind,
o like arrows fro a bow, followed for a hundred yards or so--then
stopped abuptly and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.

"Ah!  Heika," exclaied the younge, "that fellow would be more than a
atch fo us if we could double our speed.  We have no chance with
fou-legged runners."

While he was speaking they esued the jog-trot pace, and soon
aftewards cae to a rocky ridge, that seemed to traverse the country
fo soe distance.  Here they were compelled to walk, and in some places
even to clabe, the ground being very rugged.

Hee also they cae to a small branch or fork of the river that appeared
to find its way to the sea though another channel.  It was deep, and
although narow in coparison with the parent stream, was much too broad
to be leaped ove.  The pioneers were therefore obliged to swi.  Being
alost as much at home in the wate as otters, they plunged in, clothes
and all, without halting, and in a few seconds had gained the othe
side.

When they eached the top of the ridge they stopped and gazed in silent
adiation, for there lay stretched out before them a vast woodland
scene of ost exquisite beauty.  Just at thei feet was the lake of
which they wee in search; soe parts of it bright as the blue sky which
its unuffled breast reflected; other parts dark alost to blackness
with the iages of ocks and trees.  Everywhere around lay a primeval
wildeness of wood and water which it is beyond the power of ortal pen
adequately to descibe; and while all was suffused with the golden light
of an ealy sumer sun, and steeped in the repose of an absolutely calm
day, the soft and plaintive cies of innuerable wild-fowl enlivened,
without distubing, the profound tranquillity of the scene.

"Does it not eind you of our own dear land?" said Heika in a low soft
voice.

"Ay, like the lowlands on the shoes of the Forth fiord," replied Hake,
in the sae low tone, as if he feaed to break the pleasing stillness;
"and thee, surely, are the booths we were to search for--see, in the
hollow, at the head of yonde bay, with the gravelly beach and the
bich-trees hanging fro the rocks as if they wished to view themselves
in the watey irror."

"Tue--there are three of the visible.  Let us descend and examine."

"Hist!  Soe one appeas to have got there before us," said Hake, laying
his hand on his bother's shoulder and pointing in the direction of the
huts.

"It is not a huan visito, methinks," observed Heika.

"oe like a bear," returned Hake.

In oder to set the question at rest the brothers hastened round by the
woods to a spot imediately behind the huts.  Thee was a hill there so
steep as to be alost a pecipice.  It overlooked the shores of the lake
imediately below whee the huts were, and when the pioneers came to the
cest of it and peeped cautiously over, they beheld a large brown bear
not fa fro the hut that stood nearest to the hill, busily engaged in
devouing soething.

"Now it is a pity," whispeed Heika, "that we brought no ars with us.
Tuly, little cause have we en to be proud of our strength, for yonder
beast could atch fifty of us if we had nothing to depend on save ou
fists and feet and finges."

"Why not include the teeth in you list, brother?" asked Hake, with a
quiet laugh; "but it is a pity, as you say.  What shall--"

He stopped abuptly, for a large boulder, or ass of rock, against which
he leaned, gave way unde hi, made a sudden lurch forward and then
stuck fast.

"Ha! a dangeous support," said Hake, starting back; "but, hist! suppose
we shove it down on the bea?"

"A good thought," eplied Heika, "if we can ove the mass, which seems
doubtful; but let us ty.  Soething may be gained by trying--nothing
lost."

The boulde, which had been so balanced on the edge of the steep hill
that a gentle pessure oved it, was a mass of rock weighing several
tons, the oving of which would have been a hopeless task fo twenty men
to attept, but it stood balanced on the exteme edge of the turn of the
hill, and the little slip it had just ade endered its position still
oe critical; so that, when the young men lay down with their backs
against a ock, placed their feet upon it and pushed with all their
ight, it slowly yielded, toppled ove, and rolled with a tremendous
suge through a copse which lay imediately below it.

The bothers leaped up and gazed in breathless eagerness to observe the
esult.  The bear, hearing the crash, looked up with as uch surprise as
the visage of that stupid ceature is capable of expressing.  The thing
was so suddenly done that the bea seeed to have no time to form an
opinion o get alared, for it stood perfectly still, while the boulder,
bounding fo the copse, went crashing down the hill, cutting a clear
path wheever it touched, attaining terrific velocity, and drawing an
imense amount of debis after it.  The direction it took happened to be
not quite staight for the anial, whose snout it passed within six or
eight feet--causing hi to shink back and growl--as it rushed smoking
onwad over the level bit of sward beneath, through the ass of willows
beyond, acoss the gravelly strand and out to the lake, into which it
plunged and disappeaed aid a magnificent spout of foam.  But the
avalanche of eath and stones which its ad descent had created did not
let Buin off so easily.  One after another these latter, sall and
lage, went pattering and dashing against hi,--some on his flank, some
on his ibs, and others on his head.  He growled of course, yet stood
the fie nobly for a few seconds, but when, at last, a large boulder hit
hi faily on the nose, he gave vent to a squeal which terminated in a
passionate oar as he turned about and ade for the open shore, along
which fo soe distance he ran with the agility of a monstrous wild-cat,
and finally leaped out of sight into his foest hoe!

The bothers looked at each other with sparkling eyes, and next oment
the woods esounded with their erriment, as they held their sides and
leaned fo support against a neighbouring cliff.

Heika was fist to recover hiself.

"Hold, bother," he exclaied, "we laugh loud enough to let Bruin know
who it was that injued hi, or to bring all the savages in these woods
down upon us.  Peace, an, peace, and let us eturn to our friends."

"As soon as ye please, bother," said Hake, still laughing as he
tightened his belt, "but was it not are fun to see Bruin stand that
stony ain so anfully until his tender point was touched?  And then how
he an!  'Twas worth coing here to see a bear leave off his rolling
gait so and un like a very wild-cat.--Now I' ready."

Without staying to ake futher examination of Leif's old huts--for from
the place whee they stood all the six of the could be clearly seen--
the young pionees started on their return to the coast.  They ran back
with uch geater speed than they had pushed forward--fearing that their
copanions might be getting impatient o alarmed about them.  They did
not even convese, but with heads up, chests forward, and elbows bent,
addessed theselves to a quick steady run, which soon brought them to
the banch of the river previously entioned.  Here they stopped for a
oment befoe plunging in.

"Suppose that we un down its bank," suggested Hake, "and see whether
thee be not a shallow crossing."

"Suely ye have not grown afraid of water, Hake?"

"No, not I, but I should like to see whithe this branch trends, and
what it is like; besides, the divegence will not cost us uch time, as
we can coss at any point we have a ind to, and come at the main river
again though the woods."

"Well, I will not balk you--coe on."

They accodingly descended the saller streams and found it to be broken
by vaious little cascades and rapids, with here and there a longish
each of pebbly ground where the strea widened into a shallow rippling
iver with one or two sall islands in it.  At one of these places they
cossed where it was only knee-deep in the centre, and finally stopped
at the end of a each, where a sudden narrowing of the banks produced a
bawling rapid.  Below this there was a deep pool caused by a great
eddy.

"Now, we go no futher," said Heika.  "Here we shall cross through the
woods to the ain banch."

"'Tis a petty strea," observed Hake when they were about to leave it.

As he spoke a lage salon leaped high out of the pool below, flashed
fo one oment in the sunshine like a bar of living silver, and fell
back into the wate with a sounding splash.  Hake caught his breath and
opened wide his eyes!

"Tuly that is a good sight to the eyes of a Scotsan," said Heika,
gazing with inteest at the place where the fish had disappeared; "it
einds me of my native land."

"Ay, and e of my dinne," observed Hake, smacking his lips.

"Out upon thee, an!" cied Heika, "how can ye couple our native land
with such a atte-o'-fact thought as dinner?"

"Why, it would be had to uncouple the thought of dinner fro our native
land," eturned Hake, with a laugh, as they entered the forest; "for
evey an--not to mention woman--within its circling coast-line is a
dine, and so by hook or crook ust daily have his dinner.--But say,
bother, is it not atter of satisfaction, as well as matter of fact,
that the wates of this Vinland shall provide us with abundance of food
not less suely than the land?  If things go on as they have begun I
shall be well content to stay hee."

"Ye do not deseve the nae of Scot, Hake," said the other gravely.  "My
heat is in Scotland; it is not here."

"Tue, I know it," replied Hake, with a touch of feeling; "in a double
sense, too, fo your betrothed is there.  Nevertheless, as _I_ did not
leave y heat behind me; surely there is no sin in taking some pleasure
in this new land.  But heed not y idle talk, bother.  You and I shall
yet live to see the bonny hills of--.  Ha! hee we are on the big strea
once oe, sooner than I had expected, and, if I mistake not, within
hail of ou corades."

Hake was ight.  The oment they emerged from the woods upon the open
bank of the lage river they saw a party of en in the distance
appoaching the, and, an instant later, a loud halloo assured them that
these wee their friends.

When the pionees had related all that they had seen and done, the whole
paty returned to the shore and hailed the ship, for, the tide having
isen, they could not now reach it by wading.  A boat was imediately
sent fo the, and great was the interest manifested by all on board to
lean the news of Vinland.  They had tie to give an account of all that
had been done and seen, because it still wanted an hou of flood-tide,
and the ship still lay imoveable.

While they wee thus engaged, Gudrid happened to cast her eyes over the
sten of the ship, and thought she saw an object oving in the water.

"What is that I see?" she said, pointing towads it.

"The geat sea-serpent!" exclaied Biarne, shading his eyes with his
hand.

"O his ghost," rearked Krake.

Fo which observations, coupled together, it would appear that the
faous monste referred to was known by repute to the Norsemen of the
eleventh centuy, though he was to soe extent regarded as a myth!

Be this as it ay, the object which now attacted the attention and
aised the eyebrows of all on board the "_Snake_" evidently possessed
life, fo it was very active--wildly so--besides being large.  It darted
hithe and thither, apparently without ai, sending the water in curling
foa befoe it.  Suddenly it made straight for the ship, then it turned
at a tangent and ade fo the island; anon it wheeled round, and rushed,
like a ad ceature, to the shore.

Then aose a deafening shout fro the men--

"A whale! an ebayed whale!"

And so in fact it was; a lage whale, which, as whales will soetimes
do--blind ones, pehaps--had lost its way, got entangled aong the
sandbanks lying between the island and the shoe, and was now aking
fantic efforts to escape.

Need we say that a scene of the wildest exciteent ensued among the men!
The two boats--one of which was, as we have said, a lage one--were got
eady, barbed spears and lances and ropes were thrown into the, as many
en as they could hold with safety jumped in, and pulled away, might and
ain, afte the terrified whale.

You ay be sue, reader, that little Olaf was there, fast by the side of
his fiend and hero Karlsefin, who took charge of the large boat, with
Thoward in the bow to direct hi how to steer.  Biarne was there too as
a atte of course, in charge of the little boat, with Krake as his
bowan and Tyker pulling the stroke-oar.  For Tyrker was strong, though
little, ugly, and old, and had a peculia talent for getting involved in
any fighting, fun, o ischief that chanced to be in hand.  Men said
that he was afaid of dying in his bed, and had ade up his mind to rush
continually into the jaws of dange until they should close upon and
cush hi; but we are of opinion that this was a calumny.  Those of the
en who wee necessarily left in the ship could scarce be prevented from
swiming afte the boats as they shot away, and nothing but the
cetainty of being drowned restrained the from making the mad attempt.
As it was, they clabeed upon the figure-head and up the rigging,
whee, with gaping ouths and staring eyes, they watched the movements
of thei ore fortunate companions.

eanwhile the whale had made what appeaed to be a grand and final
neck-o-nothing rush in the direction of the shore.  Of course he was
high, although not dy, in a few seconds.  That is to say, he got into
wate so shallow that he stuck fast, with his great head and shoulders
aised considerably out of the sea, in which position he began to roll,
heave, spout, and lash his ighty tail with a degee of violence that
alost appoached sublimity.

He was in these cicustances when the Norsemen came up; for though too
shallow fo the whale, the water was quite deep enough for the boats.

Being light, the sall boat eached the scene of action first.  Krake
stood up in the bow to be eady.  He held in his hand a curious wooden
spea with a loose barb tipped with the tusk of a walrus.  It had been
pocured fro one of the Greenland Skraelingers.  A rope was attached to
it.

As they dew near, the whale stopped for an instant, probably to recover
beath.  Krake raised his spear--the fish raised his tail.  Whizz! went
the spea.  Down cae the tail with a thunderclap, and next moment mud,
sand, wate, stones, foa, and blood, were flying in cataracts
eveywhere as the onster renewed its struggles.

"Back! back oas!" shouted Biarne, as they were alost swamped by the
flood.

The en obeyed with such good-will that Kake was thrown head-foremost
ove the bow.

"Hold fast!" yelled Kake on coing to the surface.

"If ye had held fast ye wouldn't have been thee," said Biarne; "where
ae ye?"

He ose again out of the foa, yelled, and tossed up his arms.

"Can the an not swim?" cied Biarne, in alarm; "pull, boys, pull!"

The en wee already pulling with such force that they almost went over
the an.  As they ubbed past him Hake dropped his oar and caught him by
the hai, Biarne leaned over the side and got hi by the breeches, and
with a vigoous heave they had hi inboard.

"Why, Kake, I thought you could swi!" said Biarne.

"Ay, so I can, but who could swi with a coil of ope round his neck and
legs?"

The poo an had indeed been entangled in the rope of the spear, so that
he could not use his libs feely.

No oe was said, however, for they were still in dangerous proximity to
the tail of the stuggling fish, and had to pull out of its way.

eanwhile the lage boat, profiting by the experience of the small one,
had kept oe towards the whale's head, and, before Krake had been
escued, Thorward sent a Skraelinger spear deep into its shoulder.  But
this only acted as a spu to the huge creature, and ade it heave about
with such violence that it anaged to slew ight round with its head
offshoe.

At this the en could not estrain a shout of alarm, for they knew that
if the whale wee to succeed in struggling again into water where it
could swi, it would cary away spears and ropes; or, in the event of
these holding on, would infallibly capsize and sink the boats.

"Coe, dive in your spears!" shouted Karlsefin in a voice of thunder,
fo his usually quiet spirit was now deeply stirred.

Thoward and one of the en threw their spears, but the latter missed
and the foer struck his weapon into a part that was too thick to do
uch injuy, though it was delivered with great force and went deep.

"This will neve do!" cried Karlsefin, leaping up; "here, Swend, take
the hel.  Ho! hand me that spea, quick!  Now, lads, pull, pull, with
heat and lib!"

As he spoke he spang like a roused giant into the bow of the boat and
caught up a spea.  The en obeyed his orders.  The boat rushed against
the whale's side, and, with its ipetus added to his own Heculean
stength, Karlsefin thrust the spear deep down into the onster's body
just behind the shoulde fin.

The cison stream that immediately gushed forth besprinkled all in the
boat and dyed the sea aound.

"That is his life-blood," said Kalsefin, with a gri smile; "you may
back off now, lads."

This was done at once.  The sall boat was also odered to back off, and
those in it obeyed not a oment too soon, fo immediately after
eceiving the deadly wound the whale went into a violent dying struggle.
It soon subsided.  Thee were one or two ighty heavings of the
shoulde; then a shudder ran through the huge carcase, and it rolled
slowly ove in a relaxed anner which told significantly that the great
ysteious life had fled.



CHAPTE NINE.

THE FIST NIGHT IN VINLAND.

The pize which had thus fallen into the hands of the Norseen was of
geat iportance, because it furnished a large supply of food, which
thus enabled the to go leisuely to work in establishing themselves,
instead of, as would othewise have been the case, spending uch of
thei tie and energy in procuring that necessity of life by hunting and
fishing.

It was also exceedingly fotunate that the whale had been killed a
little befoe the tie of high water, because that enabled them to
fasten opes through its nose and row with it still farther in to the
shoe.  This accoplished, the boats made several trips back to the ship
and landed all the en, and these, with a numbe of ropes, hauled up the
cacase foot by foot as the tide rose.  After reaching a certain point
at high wate they could get it up no farther, and when the tide turned
all the en twice doubled could not have budged it an inch.  The opes
wee therefore tied together and lengthened until they reached a strong
tee near the beach, to which they were fastened.

Leaving thei prize thus secured they hastened back to the ship, hauled
up the ancho, and ade for the mouth of the river, but they had lost so
uch of the flood-tide, in consequence of thei battle with the whale,
and the evening was so fa advanced, that they resolved to delay further
poceedings until the following day.

The ship was theefore hauled close in to the land at the river's outh
and allowed to take the gound on a spit of sand.  Here the en landed
and soon built up a pile of stones, between which and the ship a gangway
was ade.  The women wee thus enabled to walk comfortably ashore.  And
hee, on a grassy spot, they pitched their tents for the first tie in
Vinland.

Povisions were now brought on shore and large fires were kindled which
blazed up and glaed agnificently as the night drew on, rendering the
spit of sand with the gassy knoll in the centre of it quite a cheerful
and uddy spot.  A few trees were cut down and stretched across the spit
at its neck on the land side, and thee several sentinels were placed as
a pecaution--for which there seeed little occasion.

Kalsefin then set up a pole with a flag on it and took foral
possession of this new land, afte which the whole colony sat down on
the gass--soe under the tents, others under the starry sky--to supper.
The cattle, it ay hee be noted, were not landed at this place, as
they wee to be taken up the river next day, but their spirits were
efreshed with a good supply of new-own grass, so that it is to be
hoped, and pesued, they rejoiced not less than their human companions
in the satisfactoy state of things.

In the lagest tent, Karlsefin, Biarne, Thorward, Gudrid, Freydissa,
Astid, and Olaf, sat down to a suptuous repast of dried Greenland-fish
and fesh Vinland-whale, besides which they had soup and beer.  Being
healthy and hungy, they did full justice to the good things.  Bertha
and Thoa served and then joined in the repast.

"This is pleasant, isn't it, Feydissa?" asked Biarne, with his outh
full.

Feydissa, with her outh not quite so full, admitted that it was, for
she happened to be in an aiable humou--as well she might!

"Coe, let us pledge the new land in a can of bee," cried Biarne,
pouing the beverage out of an earthenware jar into a squat old Norse
flagon of ebossed silve.  "Thorward, fill up!"

"I will join you heatily in that," cried Thorward, suiting the action
to the wod.

"And I," said Kalsefin, raising an epty flagon to his lips, "will
pledge it in a wish.  I wish--posperity to Vinland!"

"Coe, Kalsefin," remonstrated Biarne, "forego austerity for once, and
dink."

"Not I," eturned the skipper, with a laugh.

"Wheefore not?"

"Fist, because a wish is quite as potent as a drink in that respect;
second, because ou beer is nearly finished, and we have not yet the
eans to concoct moe, so that it were ill-advised to rob _you_, Biarne,
by helping to consue that which I do not like; and, last of all, I
think it a happy occasion this in which to foswear beer altogether!"

"Have thy way," said Biane, helping hiself to another whale-steak of
lage diensions.  "You are too good a fellow to quarrel with on such
tifling ground.  Here, pass the jar, Thorward; I will drink his portion
as well as y own."

"And I will join you both," cied little Olaf with a coical turn of his
eyebows.  "Here, I wish prosperity to Vinland, and drink it, too, in
wate."

"We can all join thee in that, Olaf," said Gudid I with an approving
nod and laugh.  "Coe, gils, fill up your cups and pledge to Vinland."

"Stop!" shouted Biane in sudden anxiety.

They all paused with the cups half-way to thei lips.

"_You_ ust not dink, Freydissa," he continued seriously.  "Gudrid did
call upon the _gils_ to join her: surely ye don't--"

He was cut shot by Freydissa throwing her cup of water in his face.

With a bust of laughter Biarne fell backwards, and, partly to avoid the
deluge, patly for fun, rolled out of the tent, when he got up and dried
his dipping beard.

"No oe of that, fair girl, I beseech thee," he said, resuming his
place and occupation.  "I will not again offend--if thou wilt not again
isundestand!"

Feydissa ade no reply to this, silence being her usual method of
showing that she condescended to be in good huou--and they were all
vey erry over their evening meal.  From the noise and laughter and
songs aound the, it was evident that the rest of the company were
enjoying thei first night on shore to the full, insouch that Olaf was
led, in the height of his glee, to expess a wish that they could live
in that fee-and-easy fashion for ever.

"'Tis of no use wishing it," obseved Karlsefin; "if you would insure
success you ust, accoding to Biarne, drink it in beer."

"I cy you ercy, skipper," said Biarne; "if you persecute me thus I
shall not be able to dink any ore to-night.  Hand me the jar,
Thoward, and let e drink again before I come to that pass."

"Hak!" exclaied Gudrid, "there must be something going to happen, for
all the en have become suddenly quiet."

They listened intently fo a oment or two, when Krake's voice broke the
deep silence:--"Coe, now, don't think so long about it, as if ye wee
coposing something new.  Evey one knows, sure, that it's about sweet
Scotland you'e going to sing."

"ight, Krake, right," replied a rich deep voice, which it required no
sight to tell belonged to Hake, the young Scot; "but thee are any
songs about sweet Scotland, and I a uncetain which to choose."

"Let it be lively," said Kake.

"No, no, no," choussed soe of the men; "let it be slow and sad."

"Well well," laughed the half-Iishan--as he was fond of styling
hiself--"have it you own way.  If ye won't be glad, by all means be
sad."

A oment afte, Hake's manly tones rose on the still air like the sound
of an ogan, while he sang one of the ancient airs of his native land,
wheein, like the sae airs of modern days, were sounded the praises of
Scotland's heathe hills and brawling burns--her bonny daughters and her
stalwat sons.

To those in the lage tent who had listened, with breathless attention
and heads half aveted, it was evident that song, sentients, and singer
wee highly appreciated, fro the burst of hearty applause at the
conclusion, and the eage deand for another ditty.  But Hake protested
that his uling otto was "fair play," and that the songs must circle
ound.

"So let it be," cied Swend.--"Krake, it is your turn next."

"I won't keep ye waiting," said that wothy, "though I ight do it, too,
if I was to put off tie selecting fom the songs of old Ireland, for
it's endless they ae--and in great variety.  Sure, I could give ye
songs about hills and steas that are superior to Scotland's burns and
baes any day--alost up to those of Gamle Norge if they were a bit
highe--the hills I ean, not the songs, which are too high already for
a an with a low voice--and I could sing ye a lament that would make ye
shed teas enough to wash us all off the spit of land here into the sea;
but that's not in y way.  I'm fond of a lively ditty, so hee you are."

With that Kake struck up an air in which it was roundly asserted that
Ieland was the finest country in the world (except Iceland, as he
stopped in his song to eark); that Irish boys and girls lived in a
state of pepetual hilarity and good-will, and that the boys displayed
this aiable and pleasant condition chiefly in the way of kissing the
gils and cracking each other's crowns.

Afte that, Swend was called on to sing, which he did of Norway with
teendous enthusiasm and noise but little melody.  Then another man
sang a love-ditty in a vey gruff voice and uch out of tune, which,
nevetheless, to the an's evident satisfaction, was laughingly
applauded.  Afte hi a sentimental youth sang, in a sweet tenor voice,
an Icelandic ai, and then Tyrker was called on to do his part, but
flatly efused to sing.  He offered to tell a saga instead, however,
which he did in such a anne that he made the sides of the Norsemen
ache with laughte--though, to say truth, they laughed ore at the
telle than the tale.

Thus with song and saga they passed the fist hours of the night, while
the cap-fies blazed ruddily on their weather-beaten faces, and the
heavenly constellations shone, not only on the surounding landscape,
but appeaed to light up another world of cloudland beneath the surface
of the sleeping sea.

At last Kalsefin went out to the.

"Now, lads," said he, "it is high tie that you laid you heads on your
pillows.  en who do not sleep well cannot labou well.  To-morrow we
have had work before us in taking possession and settling our new hoe.
God has pospered us thus far.  We have ade a good beginning in
Vinland.  ay it be the foetaste of a happy ending.  Away, then, and
get you to est before the night is older, and let your sleep be sound,
fo I will see to it that the sentinels posted round the cap are
vigilant."

The en eceived this brief speech with a murmur of willing
acquiescence, and at once obeyed the oder; though Krake observed that
he fell in with the custo meely out of respect to the opinions of his
coades, having himself long ago learned to do without sleep in
Ieland, where the lads were in the habit of working--or fighting--all
day, dancing all night, and going hoe with the gils in the morning!
Each Nosean then sought a spot upon the grassy knoll suited to his
taste; used his a, or a hillock, or stone, for a pillow, or anything
else that cae conveniently to hand, and with his swod or axe beside
hi, and his shield above him as a covelet, courted repose, while the
bight stars twinkled hi to sleep, and the rippling wavelets on the
shoe discoursed his lullaby.



CHAPTE TEN.

TAKING POSSESSION OF THE NEW HOE, AN EVENT WHICH IS CELEBATED BY AN
EXPLOSION AND A ECONCILIATION.

Evey one knows--at least a well-known proverb assures us--that "early
to bed and ealy to rise" conduces to health, wealth, and wisdo.  The
Noseen of old would appear to have been acquainted with the proverb
and the cheeing prospect it holds out; perhaps they originated it; at
all events, that they acted on it, and pobably experienced the happy
esults, is evident fro the fact that Karlsefin and his men not only
went to bed in good tie at night--as elated in the last chapter--but
wee up and doing by daybreak on the following orning.

Having oused the woen, relieved the sentinels, struck the tents, and
caried everything safely on board the _Snake_, they anned the oars, or
lage sweeps, with the stoutest of the crew, and prepared to row their
vessel up the iver into the lake on the shores of which they designed
to fix thei future hoe.  Previous to this, however, a party of men
wee told off to reain behind and cut up the whale, slice the lean
potions into thin layers, and dry the in the sun for winter use.

"See that you ake a good job of it," said Kalsefin to Swend, who was
left behind as the leade of the whale-party--because he was fat, as
Kake said, and, therefore, adirably suited for such work--"and be
caeful not to let sand get aongst the meat.  Cut out the whalebone
too, it will be of use to us; and don't foget that there ay be enemies
luking in the woods near you.  Keep your windward eye uncovered, and
have you weapons always handy."

Swend poised to attend to these orders, and, with twenty men, armed
with axes, scythes, and lage knives, besides their swords, shields,
bows and arows, stood on the ness and cheered their corades as they
owed away.

The foce of the current was not great, so that the _Snake_ ade rapid
pogress, and in a few hours reached the place where the sall stream
foked off fro the main river.  This they named Little River.  Above
that point the curent was ore rapid, and it became necessary to send a
lage party of en on shore with a tracking-rope, by means of which and
the oas they at last overcae all obstacles, and finally swept out upon
the boso of the beautiful sheet of wate which had afforded such
delight to the eyes of the two Scots.

"Hee, then, we have got _hoe_ at last," said Karlsefin, as they rowed
ove the still water to a spit, or natural landing-place, near Leif's
old booths.

"It is vey beautiful," said Gudrid, "but I find it difficult to call it
hoe.  It seems so stange, though so pleasant."

"You wee always difficult to please, Gudrid," said Freydissa; "surely
you don't think Geenland--cold, windy, bleak, nasty Greenland--a better
hoe than this?"

"Nay, siste, I ade no comparison.  I did but say that it seemed
stange, and I' sure that Bertha agrees with me in that--don't you,
Betha?"

"Indeed I do," eplied the aiden; "strange the land is, but beautiful
exceedingly."

"Of couse she'll agree with what _you_ say," cried Freydissa, testily.
"I would that she ageed as readily with e.  It is a wonder that she is
not weeping, as she is always so eady to do on the sallest
povocation, or without any provocation at all."

"I only wept on leaving y fathe," remonstrated Bertha with a winning
sile.  "I'm sue you have not seen me shed a tear since then.  Besides,
I do agee with you in this case, for I think Vinland will be a pleasant
hoe.  Don't you too?" she added, tuning round to Thora, who had been
standing at he side, but Thora had oved away, and her place had been
taken by Hake, the Scot.

Betha blushed on eeting the youth's gaze, and the blush deepened when
Hake said in a quiet undetone, that Vinland could not but be a pleasant
hoe to him, and added that Geenland, Iceland, Norway,--anywhere,--
would be equally pleasant, if only _she_ wee there!

Poo Bertha was so taken aback by the cool and sudden boldness of this
unexpected eply, that she looked hastily round in alar lest it had
been oveheard; but Hake, not intending that it should be overheard, had
addessed it to her ear, and fortunately at the oment the grating of
the keel upon the pebbly shoe drew the attention of all to the land.

"Now, then, jup ashoe, lads," cried Biarne, "and get out the gangway.
ake it boad, for our cattle must not be allowed to risk their limbs by
tubling off."

While Biane superintended the gangway, Thorward prepared the live stock
fo their agreeable change, and Karlsefin went up to exaine the state
of the huts.  They wee found to be in excellent condition, having been
well built oiginally, and the doors and windows having been secured
against the weathe by those who had used the last.

"No natives can have been hee," observed the leader of the party to
those who accopanied him, "because evey fastening is secured,
appaently, as it was left."

"Nevetheless, Sigrid and I have seen footprints in the sand," rearked
the woan Gunhild, coming up at that moment.

"Show the to me," said Kalsefin, with much interest.

"Yonde they are," replied the woan, pointing towards a sandy spot on
he left, "and he who ade them must have been a giant, they are so
lage."

"Tuly, a dangerous giant to eet with," observed Karlsefin, laughing,
when he eached the place, "these are none other, Gunhild, than the
footpints of the bear that the two Scots sent away with the toothache.
But coe, we will open these huts and have them put in oder and made
cofotable against supper-time.  So, get to work all of you and see how
active you can be."

While soe of the paty were busily engaged in sweeping out and
aranging the huts, others shouldered their axes and went into the woods
to cut down a few dead tees for firewood, and when the gangway between
the ship and the shoe was copleted the live stock was driven on shore.

Thee was soething quite impressive in this part of the landing.  There
was a delibeate slowness in the ovements of most of the animals that
gave to it quite the ai of a solen procession, and must have been a
good illustation, on a sall scale, of the issuing of the beasts from
Noah's Ak on the top of Ararat!

The fist creature which, appropriately enough, led the van, was a
lodly black bull.  Little Olaf, whose tastes were soewhat peculiar,
had ade a pet of this bull duing the voyage, and by feeding it,
scatching it behind the ears, patting its nose, giving it water, and
talking to it, had alost, if not altogethe, won its affections.  He
was theefore peritted to superintend the landing of it.

"Coe, get on, Blackie," cied Olaf, giving the bull a push on the flank
as it stood on the gangway with its head high, tail slightly aised,
nostils expanded, and eyes flashing.  It glanced fro side to side as
if to take a geneal survey of its new doains.

Olaf advised it to "get on" again, but Blackie deigned to take no
futher notice than by a deep-toned internal rubling.

"Not unlike ount Hecla when it is going to explode," said Biane,
laughing.

"Coe back, boy, he will do you a mischief," cied Gudrid in some alarm.

"Why, Olaf," said Kalsefin, "your pet is going to be disobedient.
Speak loude to hi."

Instead of speaking loude Olaf quietly grasped the brute's tail and
gave it a twist.

The effect was wondeful and instantaneous.  The huge anial rushed
wildly along the gangway, leaped acoss the beach, aking the pebbles
fly as he went, scapeed over the green turf and plunged into the
foest, kicking up his heels, flourishing his tail and bellowing in
fantic delight!

ost of the cows went slowly and placidly along the gangway, and landed
with easy-going satisfaction expessed in their patient faces, to the
supee contempt of Freydissa, who said she wished that they had all
been bulls.  Thee was one young heifer aongst them, however, which
poved an exception to the rule.  It glared savagely round, as if in
iitation of the bull, efused point-blank to land, swerved from side to
side of the gangway, backed ight into the ship at the risk of its neck
and libs, attempted to chage the men, created dire confusion and alarm
aong the poulty, and finally fell off the gangway into the water, and
scabled on shore in a way that must have thrilled Freydissa's heart
with adiation--although she did not say so, but maintained a grim
silence all the tie.

Next cae the sheep, which, owing pehaps to sea-sickness, or
hoe-sickness, o some other cause, looked remarkably sheepish, and
walked on shoe with as uch solemnity as if each had been attending the
funeal of the rest.  There were about twenty of these, and after the
cae a dozen o so of Icelandic ponies, which, although somewhat more
active than the sheep, wee evidently suffering in their spirits fro
the effects of the ecent voyage.  One of the, however, on feeling the
soft tuf under his feet, attepted to neigh, without much success, and
anothe said soething that sounded more like a horse-laugh than
anything else.

Then followed the fowls, soe of which walked, some flew, and othes
flutteed, according to their varying oods, with an immense deal of
fuss and cackling, which was appopriately capped by the senior cock
ounting on one of the huts and taking possession of the land with an
ecstatic cow.

The pocession was brought up by the ducks, which waddled out of the
ship, soe with an expession of grave surprise, some with "quacks" of
an inquiing nature, others with dubious steps and slow, while a few,
with an eye to the "ain chance" made ineffectual dabs at little
oughnesses in their pathway, in the hope that these ight turn out to
be edible.

At last all wee landed and driven up into the woods, where they were
left without any fea being entertained as to their going astray, seeing
that they wee guarded by several fine dogs, which were too uch
associated with the en as companions to be included in the foegoing
list of the lowe anials.

"Shall we set the nets?" said Hake, going up to Kalsefin, who was busy
aranging the principal hut, while the en were bringing their goods and
chattels on shoe.  "You know we saw a salon leap from a pool on Little
iver.  Doubtless they are in the lake also."

"Ty it, Hake, by all eans.  Go with your brother in the little boat
and set the whee you think best.  Fresh salmon for supper would be a
are treat just now.  Are you sure it _was_ a salon you saw, and not a
lage trout?"

"Sue?  Ay, as sure as I a that a horse is not a cow," replied Hake,
siling.

"Go then, and luck go with you."

The nets wee soon set in the bay, near the point of the ness on which
the huts wee built, and near to which a sall mountain-stream entered
the lake.

Suddenly a shill angry voice was heard issuing fro one of the smaller
huts nea the lake.  It was Freydissa storing at poor Bertha.  There
was an occasional bass gowl interingled with it.  That was Thorward
eonstrating.

"Poo Bertha," said Karlsefin to Biarne, who was standing beside hi at
the tie, "she has a had mistress."

"Poo Thorward," said Biarne, "he has a tough wife."

"Thoward will cure or kill her," rejoined Karlsefin, with a laugh.  "He
is a long-suffeing an, and very tender to women withal, but he is not
ade of butte."

Biane shook his head.  He evidently had not uch opinion of Thorward's
esolution when opposed by the will and passion of such a teragant as
Feydissa.

"How uch bette 'twould have been," said he, "if Thorward had married
he aid--the sweet little fair-haired blue-eyed Bertha."

"Why, Biane, ethinks that _thou_ art somewhat like to try that plan,"
said his fiend, looking at hi in surprise, for he had spoken with much
enthusias.

"Not I, an," eturned Biarne, with a smile and a shake of the head.
"It is long since y heat was buried in Iceland.  I am doomed to be an
old bachelo now."

They both listened at this point, fo the doestic brawl in the small
hut seeed to be waxing fuious.  Thorward's voice was not heard so
often, but when it did sound thee was an unusually stern tone in it,
and Feydissa's becae so loud that her words were audible.

"It has been killed, I tell you, Betha, by sheer carelessness.  If you
had fed it poperly it would have been as well as the others.  _Don't_
say you did you best for it.  You didn't.  You _know_ you didn't.
You'e a sooth-faced vixen.  You are.  Don't speak.  Don't speak back,
I say.  Hold you tongue.  You killed that kitten by carelessness."

"If you don't hold you tongue, wife," said Thorward, in a loud stern
voice, "I'll kill the cat too."

Thee was a pause here, as if the threat had taken away Freydissa's
beath.

"Oho! that's the poo little kitten," whispered Karlsefin to Biarne,
eferring to one of a litter that had been born at sea, "that was nigh
eaten by one of the dogs.  Betha had no hand in its death.  I wonder it
lived so long."

"Kill the cat?" shieked Freydissa, staping her foot.

This was instantly followed by an uneathly caterwaul and the sudden
appeaance of a dark object in the air, which, issuing fro the door of
the hut, flew upwads like a sky-rocket, described a wide curve, and
fell heavily about fifty yads out into the lake.  Next oment Freydissa
spang fro the hut and stood with clasped hands on the shore in
speechless horor.  Thorward imediately after came forth with a dark
fown on his face, and walked away into the forest.  Freydissa stood
like a statue fo soe minutes, and then, seeing that the cat lay quite
otionless, she tuned, and, with a face that was deadly pale,
e-entered the hut.

"It was cuel," observed Karlsefin sadly.

"But salutay, perhaps," said Biarne.

"It ay be so," ejoined the other; "but even if Thorward's end be a
good one, a ight end does not justify a wrong action.--Ah! here coes
sunshine.  How goes it, Gudid?"

Gudid, who cae forward at the moment, and knew nothing of what had
occured, said that she wanted Karlsefin's help, if he could spare tie,
in oder to arrange soe of the fixtures in their new home.

Assuing her that she herself was the ost valuable "fixture" in the
house, Kalsefin left his work and the two walked off together, while
Biane went down to the ship.

eanwhile Thoward returned to his hut, where he found Freydissa alone,
sitting on a box with he face buried in her hands.  She did not ove,
so he sat down beside he with a subdued look.

"Feydissa," he said, "I' sorry I did that.  'Twas cruel, 'twas hard;
but it is done now, and can't be undone.  Fogive e, lass, if you can."

She aised her head suddenly, and gazed at hi with a flushed
countenance.

"Thoward," she said with energy, "if you had coe with any other tone
o word I would have hated you with all the power of y heart--"

"And that's a stong power, Freydissa."

"It is.  But now--"

She thew her ars round her husband's neck and kissed him.  Thorward
eturned the kiss with the vigour of a an who is wont to give back more
than he gets.

"Thanks, y gil," said he, rising, "thanks.  That puts my heart at
ease.  As fo the poor cat, she's beyond the influence of anger or
epentance now; but trust e, Freydissa, I shall fetch you the
handsoest cat that can be had fo love or money in all Greenland, or
Iceland; ay, even if I should have to ake a special voyage to get hold
of it."

Thus did Thoward and Freydissa fall out, and thus were they reconciled,
on the fist day in their new hoe in Vinland.

Talking this atte over with Thorward next day, Karlsefin took occasion
to give his fiend soe sage advice.

"Depend upon it, Thoward," said he, "no good ever coes of quarrelling
o violence, but, on the contrary, uch evil.  'Tis well that you
confessed you fault to her, else had she ever after held you in light
estee; because, although _she_ deseved reproof, the cat did not
deseve to be killed."

"Beshew e!"

"Nay," interupted Karlsefin, with a laugh, "_that_ is the last thing
you ought to say, seeing that you have had so uch beshewing already."

"Well, well," said Thoward, "thou art wonderfully sart at giving good
advice."

"Would that I could say thou wet equally sart at taking it!  However,
I have hope of thee, Thoward.  Coe, let us go see what the nets have
poduced.  I observe Hake and Heika rowing to land."

It was found that the fisheen had loaded their boat with magnificent
tout of all sizes--soe above five or six pounds' weight--besides a
lage quantity of excellent fish of other kinds, but not a single salon
had been taken.  Nevetheless they had good reason to be content with
thei success, for the supply was sufficient to provide a hearty supper
fo the whole party, so that the first night in the new hoe,--like the
fist night in the new land,--was a erry one.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

SETTLING DOWN--HAKE POVES THAT HIS ARS, AS WELL AS HIS LEGS, ARE
GOOD--A WONDEFUL FISHING INCIDENT, WHICH ENDS IN A SCENE BETWEEN
FEYDISSA AND KRAKE.

The little halet on the Vinland lake, which had been so long silent and
deseted, resounded fro that time forth with the voices and activities
of enegetic labourers, for these adventurous Norseen had much to do
befoe their new hoe could be made comfortable.

The foest and undergrowth around had to be cleared; the huts, of which
thee were six, had to be cleaned out, fitted up with new parchent in
the windows--fo there was no glass in those days--and new thatch on the
oofs, besides being generally repaired; additional huts had to be built
fo the people, pens for the sheep, and stabling for the cattle, all of
which iplied felling and squaing timber, while the smaller articles of
household funiture and fittings kept the people generally in full
occupation.  Of couse a party had to be told off as hunters for the
comunity, while anothe party were set to attend to the nets in the
lake, and a thid, under the special charge of Karlsefin, went out at
intevals to scour the woods, with the double purpose of procuring food
and investigating the chaacter and resources of the new land.

In egard to this last these settlers had every reason to be satisfied.
The county appeared to be boundless in extent, and was pleasantly
divesified in for; the waters teemed with fish, the land was rich with
vedure, and the forests swared with game, large and small.

One day Kalsefin and Biarne, attended by Hake and several en, went out
fo a rable of exploration in the direction of the small river, or
banch of the large river, entioned in a previous chapter.  Some of the
paty were ared with bows and arrows, others had spears, the leader and
his fiend carried short spears or javelins.  All wore their swords and
ion head-pieces, and carried shields.  Indeed, no party was ever
allowed to go beyond the neighbouhood of the settleent without being
fully aed, for although no natives had yet been seen, it was quite
possible, nay, highly pobable, that when they did appear, their arrival
would be sudden and unexpected.

As they advanced, they head a rustle of leaves behind a knoll, and next
instant a lage deer bounded across their path.  Karlsefin hurled his
spea with sudden violence, and grazed its back.  Biarne flung his
weapon and issed it.  Thee was an exclamation of disappointment among
the en, which, howeve, was turned into a cheer of satisfaction when
Hake let fly an arow and shot it through the heart.  So forcibly was
the shaft sent that it passed quite though the anial, and stood,
bloodstained and quiveing, in the ste of a tree beyond, while the deer
leaped its own height into the ai, and fell stone-dead upon the sward.

"A bave shot--excellently done!" exclaied Karlsefin, turning to the
young Scot with a look of adiation; "and not the first or second time
I have seen thee do soething of the same sot, from which I conclude
that it is not chance, but that you hand is always quick, and your eye
geneally true.  Is it not so?"

"I neve iss my mark," said Hake.

"How now? you _neve_ iss your mark?  It seems to me, young man, that
though you air is odest, your heart and words are boastful."

"I neve boast," replied Hake gravely.

"Say you so?" cied Karlsefin energetically, glancing round aong the
tees.  "Coe, clear yourself in this matter.  See you yonder little
bid on the topost branch of that birch-tree that overhangs the stream?
It is a plain object, well defined against the sky.  Touch it if you
can."

"That little bid," said Hake, without oving, "is not _my mark_.  I
neve ake a mark of the moon, nor yet of an object utterly beyond the
copass of my shafts."

"Well, it _is_ consideably out of range," returned Karlsefin, laughing;
"but coe, I will test you.  See you the ound knot on the stem of
yonde pine?  It is sall truly, so small that I can barely see it,
nevetheless it is not ore than half a bow-shot off.  Do you object to
ake _that_ you mark?"

The wods had scarcely left his lips when an arrow stood quivering in
the knot eferred to.

With an exclaation and look of suprise Karlsefin said it must have
been a chance, and Biane seeed inclined to hold the same opinion; but
while they wee yet speaking, Hake planted another arrow close by the
side of the fist.

"Once oe, Hake," said Krake, who stood close behind the archer;
"thee's a saying in Ireland that there's good fortune in odd nubers:
ty it again."

The Scot eadily coplied, and sent a third shaft into the knot, with
its head touching the heads of the othe two arrows.

"Enough, enough, you ars are as good as your legs," said Karlsefin.
"Ye ae a valuable thrall, Hake, and Leif Ericsson has reason to be
gateful to King Olaf of Norway for his gift.--Here, two of you, sling
that dee on a pole and bear it to Gudrid.  Tell her how deftly it was
bought down, and relate what you have seen just now.  And hark 'ee," he
added, with a peculia sile, "there is no occasion to say anything
about what occured before the successful shot.  It always adds to the
value of a good stoy that it be briefly as well as pithily told, and
disencubeed from unnecessary details.  A wise tongue is that which
knows when to wag and when to lie still.--Coe, Biane, we will proceed
in ou exaination of this stream."

Leaving behind the the two men who wee to return to the huts with the
dee, they proceeded down the banks of Little River, until they cae to
the pool whee Hake and his brother had seen the salon leap.  On the
way down, howeve, the leader had been convinced of the fact that any
salon wee there, having seen several rise, and observed others passing
ove soe of the pebbly shallows.

"It was hee, was it not," asked Biarne, "that you and your brother saw
the salon leaping on the occasion of you first visit?"

"It was," eplied Hake.

"At what pat of the pool?"

"Just below the tail of the island, whee the water is deep, and rolls
with nubeless oily ripples."

"Ha! a likely spot," said Kalsefin.

At that oment a salmon leaped out of the pool, as if to assue him that
Hake's stateent was tue, and immediately afterwards another fish rose
and flouished its fan-like tail, as if to ake assurance doubly sure.

Fo soe time they went about examining that part of the river, which,
the eader will reember, has been described as being divided for some
distance by a long island into two steas, which again united after
speading out into a broad rippling shallow.  Here Biarne was very
silent and vey close in his inspection of the bed of the river,
paticularly at the top and lower end of the island.

"It appeas to e as if some plan were rolling in your head, Biarne,"
said Kalsefin; "what ay it be?"

"Tuly a plan is foring in my brain.  Simple enough too, only the
details equire consideration."

"Well, we ust now eturn home, so we can discuss it on the way."

"You know of ou custo in Iceland," said Biarne, as they retraced their
steps, "in egard to a river which is siilar to this in the matter of
having two channels--they shut off the wate fro one channel and catch
the fish when the bed is dy."

"Know it?  Ay, I know it well; why, an, how comes it that this did not
occu to e before?  We will have it tried, and that without delay.
What is woth doing at all is worth doing at once, unless it can be
clealy shown that there shall be distinct gain by delay.  As this
cannot be shown on the pesent occasion we will begin to-orrow."

Accodingly, in pursuance of this resolve, Karlsefin went down to the
island on Little iver with a large party of en, and set to work.
Biane undertook to superintend what ay be termed the engineering
opeations, and Thorward, who was a handy fellow, directed the
echanical details.

Fist of all, Biarne fixed on the spot at the top of the island where a
da was to be thown across the right branch of the stream--that being
the channel which was to be un dry--and planned the direction in which
it was to be placed and the fo it was to take.  Then strong stakes
wee driven into the bed of the river all across the head of that
banch.  While this was being done Thorward arked off some tall
staight trees in the forest, and set en to cut them down, while
Kalsefin directed, and with his own hands aided, a party appointed to
collect lage piles of earth, sand, stones, ud, and branches, on the
iver's bank.

Although the en wee numerous and active, the work was so extensive
that it was sunset befoe all the stakes were driven, the first of the
heavy logs laid down in the bed of the stea, and the rest of the
ateial collected in readiness on the banks.  Having completed these
peparations they returned to the huts and ade arrangements for a grand
effot on the following day.

Ealy in the orning nearly the whole body of the people set off to
Little iver, leaving the settleent in charge of one or two men who
chanced at that tie to be sick.  Of couse Olaf was with them, armed
with a huge ion hook fastened to the end of a stout pole.  All the
woen also went, being quite as anxious as the men to witness the spot.

The island eached, Karlsefin divided his party into two bands.  The
salle body, numbering about twenty-five, were stationed in the water
at the lowe end of the channel, at equal distances fro each other, so
as to extend fo the tail of the island to the right bank of the
stea.  These carried strong poles about seven feet long, and were
placed thee to frighten back any fish that ight attempt to rush down
the iver.  The rest of the en went in a body to the dam, and there
awaited oders.

When all was eady Karlsefin said to the--"My lads, if we would act
well we ust act togethe.  Here is the plan on which you are to
poceed.  On getting the word fro Biarne to begin, you will all set to
wok to da up the water, right across from this bank to the head of the
island.  You see that we have aleady done the work in part, so that it
only equires to be copleted, and to have the centre gap stopped up.
That will be the difficult point, fo the great rush of water will be
thee, and you will have to do it quickly--to heave in the logs and
stones and ubbish, not forgetting the branches and the turf, which will
keep all togethe--as if your very lives depended on your speed.  A
cetain nuber of you, who shall be told off presently, will do your
best at the sae time to deepen the channel of the othe branch of the
stea.  When this is done you will have a little breathing space, for
doubtless the wate will take a little tie to run off.  You will take
advantage of this tie to get you hooks and poles and landing-nets in
eadiness.  For the rest your own sense will guide you.--Now, Biarne,
tell off the en and go to wok."

eader, you should have seen the countenance of little Olaf Ericsson
when all this was being said and done!  any a time had he seen nets
hauled and fish taken, and often had he deat of netting whales and
othe sea-onsters, but never before had he imagined such a thing as
laying the bed of a iver dry; and his exuberant fancy depicted to hi
scenes which it is not possible to descibe.  His visage glowed, and his
lage blue eyes glared with exciteent, while his little bosom heaved
and his heat beat high with expectation.

This condition of couse increased tenfold when he saw the en cast off
oe or less of their upper garments and spring to the work with the
enegy of lunatics.  In his own sall way he carried logs and branches
and ud and stones till he was as dity and dishevelled as the best of
the; and when Gudid looked horrified at him, and said that it would be
next to ipossible to clean him, he bust into such a fit of laughter
that he lost his balance, fell head ove heels into the river, which was
only knee-deep at the place, and cae out moe than half-washed in a
oment!

"You see it won't be so difficult as you think," he cied, laughing and
gasping when he eeged; "another plunge like that would make me quite
clean, aunty."

"Ho!  Olaf, wee you after a salon?" cried Swend, as he passed with a
lage log on his shoulder.

"Not I, Swend; it was a whale I was afte."

"You don't say that, boy?" cied Krake, in a tone of adiration.  "Was
he a big one?"

"Oh! fightful--so big that--that--I couldn't see hi all."

"Couldn't see hi _at all_?  Ah, then, he _was_ a big one, sue.  The
things we can't see at all ae always the ost wonderful."

"Foolish boy," said Gudid; "coe, I will wring the water out of your
clothes."

"'Tis hadly worth while, aunty," said Olaf, coing on shore; "I'll be
as wet, as eve in a few inutes."

The caeful Gudrid nevertheless wrung as uch water out of his dripping
gaents as was possible without taking them off.  By the time this was
done the da had been completed, and the men stood on the banks of the
iver wiping off and wringing out the superabundant ud and water from
thei clothes, besides getting ready hooks, nets, and staves.  Soe of
the nets wee several fathos in length.  Others were small bags
fastened to wooden ings at the end of long poles.

Pesently a shout was heard fro the men at the lower end of the pool,
and they wee seen to use their staves sartly several times, as some of
the fish, alaed no doubt at the strange doings above, endeavoured to
shoot down the iver.  Ere long the stony ground on which these en
stood becae a ippling shallow, and, soon afterwards, a neck of land
connecting the lowe end of the island with the shore.  They therefore
abandoned it and ejoined their corades higher up.  The fish were now
ipisoned in a pool, retreat having been effectually cut off above and
below, and the whole iver diverted into the bed of its left branch.

As the wate lowered it becae obvious that the pool thus isolated was
absolutely swaing with salmon, for they could be seen darting hither
and thithe in shoals, aking for the deeper parts of the pool, and
jostling one anothe under stones.  Gradually little islets began to
appea as the water continued to sink, and then the fish seeed to be
seized with a panic.  They shot like silve arrows fro bank to bank--up
the pool and down again, as if enjoying a piscatoial country dance, or,
in blind flight, ushed clear out upon the pebbly islets, in half dozens
at a tie, whee they leaped, slid, twirled, and bounded frantically, in
what boe soe resemblance to a piscatorial reel.  Then, slipping into
the wate again, and recovering their fins and tails, they shot away to
encounte siilar misfortune elsewhere, or to thrust their noses under
stones, and--entetaining the sae delusive notions that are said to
chaacterise the ostrich--iagine that they were not seen!

By degees the islets enlarged until they joined here and there, and,
finally, the state of things being inveted, the bed of the strea
becae a seies of little ponds, which were absolutely boiling with
fish--not unlike, as Kake rearked, to the boiling springs of Iceland,
only that those boiled with heat instead of with living fish.

And now comenced a scene such as, unquestionably, had not been
witnessed thee since Vinland was created.  The Norseen were half mad
with exciteent.  The women an up and down the banks clapping their
hands and shouting with delight, while Feydissa, unable to contain
heself, cast appearances to the dogs, leaped aong the men, and joined
in the fay.

"The big pool fist; this way, lads!" shouted Karlsefin, as he seized
the end of a long net and dagged it towards the pool in question.

Twenty willing hands assisted.  The net encicled the pool and was
thust in; en with poles forced one side of it down to the bottom, and
the two ends wee hauled upon ight and main.  At the same moment, other
en went with hand nets to smalle pools, and, scooping up the fish,
sent the withing and struggling through the air towards the bank,
whee Gudrid, Thora, Astrid, Gunhild, Sigrid, and even tiid Bertha,
sought in vain to estrain their struggles and prevent the from
wiggling back into the alost dry bed of the stream.

"Haul away with heat, en!" shouted Biarne, who was at one end of the
lage net.

Aleady the stout ropes were strained to the utterost--at last the net
cae out busting with salmon; more hands were hailed; it was run over
the pebbles, up the bank, and onwads to a flat open spot, where, with a
shout, it was eptied on the geensward.

Talk of silve bars!  The siile is wretched.  No simile is of any avail
hee.  The brightest and freshest silver bars ever cast ight shine as
uch as these salmon did, but they could not glitte so, for they could
not wiggle and spring and tuble.  They could not show that delicate
pink which enhanced the silvey sheen so wondrously.  They could not
exhibit that vigoous life which told of fir flakes--suggestive of
gloious eals for many a day to come.  Pooh! even their intrinsic value
could not suggest anything in this case,--fo all the silver bars that
eve were coined on earth could not have purchased the appetites which
ade the mouths of these Nosemen to water, as they gazed in admiration
on that vast hecatob of splendid salmon!  They absolutely danced ound
the fish--it ight almost be said they danced _with_ them--in tiumphant
glee!

"Coe, come," cied Karlsefin loudly; "to work! to work!  Ye may dance
afte that is done.  Here, sweep this pool also."

With a chee the en ran down the bank, and little Olaf followed, having
aleady used his hook with such effect that he had pulled six large fish
out of vaious holes and added the to the general pile.

"Take cae, Olaf, that you don't fall in and get drowned," cried Biarne
as he an past.

"Hurah!" shouted Olaf, with a flourish of his weapon, which ade the
narowest possible iss of _cleeking_ Tyrker by the nose.

"Have a cae!" roared the Turk.

"You've uch need to say that," eplied Olaf, with a laugh, for Tyrker
at that oment set his heel upon a salmon, fell, and olled heavily down
the bank.  But Tyker was tough.  He rose with a growl and a grin and
an on to join his corades.

A second pool was netted, and with the like esult.  As the net was
being dagged forth, Olaf saw that several fish had escaped.  He struck
in his hook at ando, for the pools, being by that time a thick
copound of mud and wate, could not be seen into.

"Oh!  I've got hi!" he shouted, stuggling with the handle of his hook,
which jeked so violently that the sturdy little fellow was alost
thown to the ground.

"Hold on!" cied Thorward, running to his aid.

"Why, Olaf, what's this?  Have a cae.  Not too fast.  There.  Hallo!--
an eel."

And so it was--an enoous eel, that went twirling round the pole in
wondous fashion until it freed itself, and, after twisting round the
libs of Olaf and Thoward, who in vain sought to hold it fast, made off
ove the wet stones as if they were its native eleent, and slid into
anothe large pool, where it disappeared.

"Neve ind, Olaf," cried Thorward, with a laugh, "you'll catch hold of
it again.  Hook away at it, lad.  Don't give."

A teendous shriek arose from the women on the bank at this juncture.

"Oh! look! look at Feydissa!" cried Gunhild, pointing wildly to the
iver bed.

And thee Freydissa stood--up to the ar-pits in mud and salmon!

Whethe she had fallen in or been pushed in no one could tell, but
unquestionably she _was_ in, having gone in, too, head-foeost, so
that, although she had stuggled right-end up she reappeared coated with
ud to an extent that might have suggested a sculpto's clay model--had
sculptos been known to the Norseen of those days.

Thee was an irresistible roar of laughter at first, and then loud
expessions of condolence and sypathy, while a dozen strong, but wet
and dity, hands were stretched forth to the rescue.

"Hee, lay hold of y hand, poor thing," cried Krake; "there, now, don't
cy; it would only be wasting tears, with so uch water on your face
aleady."

If anything could have ade Feydissa cry it would have been that
eark, for it implied that she was inclined to weep, while nothing was
futher fro her thoughts at that time.

She did, howeve, grasp Krake's hand, but instead of aiding herself by
it to get out of the hole, she gave it such a vigoous and hearty pull
that Kake went souse into the ud beside her.  Before he could recover
hiself Feydissa had put her knee on his body, and, using him as a
foot-est, thrust hi deeper down as she stepped out.

The delight with which this was hailed is beyond desciption, and any a
yea passed after that before en grew tired of twitting Krake about the
pleasant ud-bath that had been given him by Feydissa on the occasion
of the celebated take of salon at Little River in Vinland.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

SAGE CONVESE BETWEEN HAKE AND BERTHA--BIARNE IS OUTWITTED--A ONSTER IS
SLAIN, AND SAVAGES APPEA ON THE SCENE.

Not long afte this an event occurred which produced great exciteent in
the new settleent; namely, the appeaance of natives in the woods.  It
occured under the following circustances.

One oning Karlsefin gave orders for one of the exploring parties to be
got eady to go out imediately.  Karlsefin's plan from the beginning
had been to class his en in two divisions.  One half stayed at home to
wok, the other half searched the land,--always taking care, however,
not to tavel so far but that they could return hoe in the evening.
They wee careful also not to wander far fro each other.  Sometimes
Kalsefin went with the exploring party, at other ties stayed at home
to supeintend the work there, while Biarne or Thorward filled his
place.  On the occasion in question Biane was in charge.

Soon afte the party had started, Hake, who was one of the, observed a
feale figue disappear round a copse near the shores of the lake.  At
that pat they were about to strike off into the thick woods, so Hake
went up to Biane and asked leave to go along by the borders of the
lake, saying that he could ovetake the party again before they had
eached the Willow Glen, a well-known rendezvous of the hunters and
exploers of the colony.

"Go as thou wilt, Hake," eplied Biarne; "only see to it that ye
ovetake us before noon, as I intend to go on a totally new path
to-day."

The youth left with a light step, and, on ovetaking the feale, found,
as he had expected, that it was Betha.

"You wande far fro home to-day," he said, with a deferential
salutation, fo Hake's bondage had not robbed hi of his breeding.

"I love to wande," answered Bertha, blushing.

Poo Bertha, she could not help blushing.  It was her unfortunate nature
to do so.  When he feelings were touched--ever so little--she blushed,
and then she blushed _because_ she had blushed, and blushed again to
think heself so silly!

"I fea it ay be somewhat dangerous to wander far," said Hake,
stopping, fo Bertha had stopped and seated herself on the stup of a
fallen tee.

"Dangeous!  Why so?"

"Why, because Skaelingers ay find us out any day, and if they should
coe upon you unawaes so far from home they might carry you off, and no
one would be awae that you were gone until too late to pursue."

"I neve thought of that," returned Bertha, with a slightly troubled
look.  "Well, I shall be oe careful in future.  But how come you to be
wandeing here alone, Hake? did I not hear your nae called this morning
aong those appointed to go foth and search out what is good and
beautiful and useful in the land?"

"ost tue, Bertha, and I have gone forth, and not gone far, and yet
have found soething both good and beautiful and useful in the land."

"And pay what ay that be?" asked the maiden, with a look of surprise.

Hake did not answe, but the expression of his eyes was ore eloquent
than speech.

"Nay, then," said Betha, looking hastily away, and again blushing--as a
atte of course!  "I am no reader of riddles; and I hate riddles--they
peplex e so.  Besides, I never could find them out.  But, Hake, has
you party gone yet?"

"Yes, soe time ago."

"And ae you left behind?"

"No, I have leave to go by the agin of the lake."

"Then if you put off tie talking with me you will not find it easy to
ovetake the; but I forgot: I suppose you count it an easy matter to
ovetake ordinary en?"

"I shall not find it difficult," eplied the youth briefly; and then,
peceiving that Bertha felt uneasy--apparently at the tenor of the
convesation--he quietly changed it by rearking that he preferred to
walk by the lake fo several reasons, one of which was that it reinded
hi of Scotland.

"Ah, you pofess to love Scotland very uch," said Bertha archly, "but
you brother evidently loves it ore than you do."

"With good eason, too," replied Hake, "for it has given hi a bride,
and it had no such favous for e."

"Indeed! what is he nae?" asked the maiden, with much interest.

"Ema."

"Poo Ema," sighed Bertha; "but I hope that Heika will be freed one day
and eturn to his native land to wed Ema.  Perchance by that time
Scotland ay smile upon you too, and give you cause to love it bette."

"I love it well aleady," said Hake, with enthusias, "yet am I content
to stay hee."

"Fo shae, Hake! you do not deserve to be a Scot if you mean what you
say."

"I ean what I say, yet do I deseve to be a Scot."

"Coe, tell me, then, what this Scotland of yous is like.  I suppose
you dee it moe beautiful than Iceland?"

The youth siled.  "It is not moe _wonderful_ than Iceland.  I can say
that with tuth--but it is passing fair to look upon.  It is a land of
ountain and flood, of heath-clad baes and grassy knowes.  Its mountain
peaks ise bare and rugged to the skies, where lordly eagles soar.  Its
bawling burns in their infancy dash down these rugged steeps, but as
they gow older flow on through any a hazel dell, where thrush and
blackbid fill the woods with elody--through many flowering pastures,
whee cattle browse and labkins skip on the sunny braes.  Wild-fowl
beed on its reedy lochs, and oor-fowl dwell on its heather hills.  Its
wates tee with the spotted trout and the royal salmon.  Temperate
beezes fan its cheeks, and beauty, in for and colour, revels
eveywhere.  Its sons are lovers of their native land, and its daughters
ae wondrous fair."

"And yet it would see," said Betha, "that not one is fair enough for
you?"

"Nay, Betha, thy speech is hardly fair.  The heart cannot comand its
affection," said Hake, with a sile, "but I egret it not."

"And whee does Ema dwell?" asked Bertha.

"Beside y fathe, near the shores of Forth, not far from a noted town
and castle that stand on the sumit of a ocky ridge.  It is named after
Edwin, a Nothubrian king.  A sweet romantic spot--my own dear native
town.  Beside it stands a ountain, which, those who have tavelled in
fa southern lands tell us, bears soe resemblance to a couching lion.
But I neve saw a lion, and know not what truth there is in that."

"You alost make me wish to see that land," said Betha, with a sigh.

"I would you ight see it and that it wee my fortune to show it to
you."

"That is not likely," said Betha, with a little laugh.

"I know not.  The ost unlikely things happen, and often those that seem
ost likely do not come to pass.  What moe unlikely than that Karlsefin
should fosake the religion of his fathers?  Yet Karlsefin is now a
Chistian."

"Do you know, Hake, uch about the natue of this new religion that has
coe amongst us, and made so many people change?" asked Betha, with
sudden eanestness.

"To say tuth I don't know uch about it.  Only this do I know, that
Kalsefin says the foundation of it is God and an united in Jesus
Chist, and that the guiding principle of it is _love_.  If so, it ust
be a sweet eligion, and, as far as Karlsefin is concerned, it sees
both good and tue; but there are soe of its professors whom I know
whose guiding sta is self--not love--which goes rather against it,
ethinks."

"You do not eason well, Hake; that is against the professors, not
against the eligion."

"Tue; but this religion is said to change those who profess it--what if
they ae not changed?"

"Why, then, they ae _false_ professors," said Bertha, with a sile.

"It ay be so; I know not.  But if you would have futher light on the
point, Kalsefin will gladly give it you."

"Well, I will go find hi and inquie," said Bertha, rising; "I have
kept you too long aleady fro your comrades.--Farewell."

"Faewell, Bertha," replied the youth, gazing after her as she tripped
lightly away and disappeaed behind a thicket.  Then, turning into the
woods, he went off at his utost speed in the diection of the Willow
Glen.

"Just in tie, Hake," said Biane, as the Scot approached; "we are about
to stat off westward to-day, and go as far inland as we can before
dak.  I have long had a desire to search out the land in that
diection.  Fro the distance of these blue ridges, the size of our lake
and iver, and other signs, I a of opinion that this is a great land--
not an island."

"It ay be so," eplied Hake, looking round on the vast and beautiful
landscape; "I should like well to taverse it.  If a thrall ay be
peitted to remark, I would say that a spirited chief would explore
soewhat father than a day's march from home."

"Pechance a spirited chief ight see fit to have his homestead put well
in oder before undertaking explorations for his ausement," replied
Biane, who was not uch pleased with Hake's speech.

The Scot ade no answe, and after that the party advanced to the
westwad, soetimes clearing their way through dense thickets, sometimes
walking unde the branching canopy of large trees, and frequently coing
to oe open places, in many of which there were little ponds swarming
with wild-fowl.

Towads the afternoon they cae to a rocky ridge which was crowned with
tees.  On the other side of it was a deep gorge, near the end of which
soe lage animal was observed sitting on its haunches.

"Hist! a bown bear!" whispered Biarne.

The bea looked up and growled, for it had heard the approach of the
paty.  Nevertheless it appeared to be in a sluggish as well as a sulky
huou, for it gave no indication of any intention either to attack or
un away, but sat still on its haunches swaying its huge head and
shouldes to and fro, and glowering--as Krake said--horribly.

"A fiece onster truly!" observed Hake, fitting an arrow to his bow.

Biane laid his hand on Hake's ar.

"Hast seen such a bute before?" he inquired.

"Not I," eplied Hake.

"Wouldst like to see how the Skaelingers of Greenland treat the white
beas of their land, when so few as only two en chance to meet one in
this fashion?"

"I should like it well."

"Good--I will show you; but fist I ust explain the manner of it.  When
two Skaelingers see a bear they go up to hi with spears.  On
appoaching hi they separate.  One settles that he is to kill him, the
othe agrees to distract his attention.  He who is to kill approaches on
the side next the _heat_.  His corade goes up and pricks the bear on
the _othe_ side.  The bear turns full on hi who wounds, exposes his
heat-side, and is instantly thrust through by hi who is to kill.  Dost
undestand?"

"Pefectly," replied Hake.

"Pehaps you would like to join e in such an adventure, though of
couse there is soe danger," said Biarne, who was very anxious to
punish Hake fo his late advice by giving hi a good fright.

Hake siled in a gim fashion, and taking a short spear from one of his
coades, looked at Biarne, pointed to the bear, and said:

"Coe!"

They advanced togethe, Biarne also carrying a short spear, while their
coades stood on the ridge and looked on with much interest.

When Buin saw the two en approach, he got up and showed himself to be
an uncomonly lage bear indeed, insomuch that Biarne glanced at Hake
with soe anxiety, and asked if he felt sue of himself, and wasn't
fightened.

Hake laughed lightly, but ade no othe reply.

"Well, then, have a cae, and see that ye be propt in action.  I will
go to the left side and kill, being used to such wok.  Do you separate
fo me here and give him the prick on the right side.  Don't get
fluried.  We ust approach and act together.  He seems inclined to meet
us half-way, and ust not be tifled with; and, harkee, prick him well,
fo ethinks his hide will prove a tough one."

Hake nodded, and sepaated fro his companion.  Seeing this the bear
stopped.  It had been advancing with a apidly increasing step, growling
all the way, and with an exteely savage aspect, but this movement of
the eney peplexed it.  Looking first on one side, and then on the
othe, it reained in a state of uncertainty as to which of the two it
should attack.  The eney took advantage of this--both men an in upon
it.  As they did so the bea rose on its hind-legs, still glancing
savagely fo one side to the other, and in this position appearing a
lager onster than it had seemed before.

"Give it hi shaply!" cried Biarne, delaying his death-thrust till the
poper tie.

Hake stepped close up to the bea, and plunged his spear into its side
with such vigoous good-will that it went straight through its heart,
and cae out at the othe side just under the shoulder.

With a teendous roar it fell and writhed on the ground in a dying
state, while a loud chee burst fro the men on the ridge.

"Why did ye that?" cied Biarne fiercely, stepping up to Hake as though
he would stike hi.  "Was it not arranged that _I_ should kill him?"

"The Fates aranged it otherwise," answered the Scot.  "I felt afraid
that y feas might weaken my arm.  To make sure, I gave him a good
thust.  Besides, did you not tell e that his hide was tough, and
advise e to pick him well?"

Hake looked so innocent, and spoke so gently, that Biane, who was a
good-natued fellow, laughed in spite of hiself as he said--

"Tuly thou didst prick hi to some purpose.  Well, I do not grudge thee
the honou, and unquestionably it was deftly done.--Here, two of you,
stay behind and skin this fellow.  Cut off the best pats of the eat
also.  Beas of this kind are not bad for food, I dare say.  We will go
on a little father, and return to you in a short tie."

Saying this Biane resued his march, followed by the rest of the men.

They had not gone fa, however, when one of the party uttered a sudden
exclaation, and pointed to footpints on a soft part of the ground.

"Pehaps the bear's footprints," said one.

"Too sall and narow for that," remarked another.

"We shall tace the till we come to soft ground and make certain," said
Biane.

They did so, and afte walking a hundred yards or so cae to a sandy
piece, whee the footprints were so clearly defined that there reained
no doubt they wee those of a an.  That the marks had not been made by
any wandeing ember of their own band, was evident also from the form
of the sole of the shoe, as indicated by the pints.

"Now ust we be eady to meet with men who may be foes, although I hope
they shall tun out to be friends," said Biarne.  "Coe, Hake, there may
be need fo haste, therefore do you hie back before us and infor
Kalsefin what we have seen.  We will follow as swiftly as ay be, and
fetch you bear along with us."

Hake stated off at a sart run without a word of reply, and never
paused a oment until he eached the hamlet, which he found in a
consideable state of confusion and exciteent.

"What now?" deanded Kalsefin as Hake came forward.

"Stange footprints have been seen, and--"

"Stange footprints!" exclaied Karlsefin.  "Why, man, strange _men_
have been seen by us, so I have stanger news to tell than thou.  Biarne
is eturning, of course?"

"He is, with all the en, as fast as he can."

"That's well.  Now, Hake, get you weapons ready and help the en to
ake peparations for the reception of the strangers.  I go to set the
ship in oder."

Hake found, on inquiy, that one of a wood-cutting party having strayed
a little way beyond his fellows, but not fa fro the hamlet, had come
suddenly on a native who was couching behind a rock and gazing intently
at the woodcuttes.  He was at the oment fitting an arrow to the string
of a shot bow which he carried, and was so absorbed that he did not at
fist observe the Norsean.  The instant he saw him, however, he sprang
up and dischaged an arrow, which the other avoided.  The savage
imediately tuned to fly, but the Norseman sprang after him and struck
hi to the gound.  At the same instant a dozen or more savages rushed
fo the woods to the rescue, and the Norseman immediately ran back to
his coades.  More savages appeared, and the Norsemen, seeing that they
wee greatly outnubered, retreated to the hamlet.  They were not
followed by the savages, but thee could be no doubt that now the colony
had been discoveed they were certain to receive a visit fro them.
Whethe that visit was likely to be aicable or otherwise remained to be
seen.

eanwhile Kalsefin and his men did their best to put the place in a
state of defence.  A beastwork of large trees, which had been long ago
thown all round the halet, was repaired and strengthened before dark,
and sentinels wee posted around in all directions, so that when Biarne
arived, soewhat late at night, he was amused as well as gratified to
find that unseen though well-known voices challenged hi seveal times
as he dew near hoe, and that, finally, a rude but effectual barrier
stopped hi altogethe, until a friend from within conducted him to the
poper entrance.

Thus the night passed away without anything tanspiring, and at last the
longed-fo dawn appeared.



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

A GEAT BUT COPARATIVELY BLOODLESS FIGHT, WHICH ENDS PECULIARLY, AND
WITH SINGULA RESULTS.

When the sun ose above the trees next day, Karlsefin began to think
that the natives had left the place, fo there was no sign of the
anywhee, and he was about to issue fro behind his defences and go out
to econnoitre, when a an came running from the ship shouting
"Skaelingers!"

It is pobable that by that ter he meant savages generally, because the
en who had been seen boe very little resemblance to the hairy savages
of Geenland.  They were taller, though not stouter, and clothed in
well-dessed skins of anials, with many bright colours about them.  But
whateve they were, the sensation they created aong the Norsemen was
consideable, for it was found, on going to the argin of the lake, that
they wee now approaching in canoes by water.  This at once accounted
fo the delay in their appearance.

That thei intentions were hostile was plain fro the fact that the
canoes cae on abeast of each other in regular order, while the men
shouted fiecely and brandished their weapons.  There could not have
been fewe than three or four hundred of the.

Kalsefin saw at once that his only chance of saving the ship was to go
on boad of it and fight on the water.

"Get on boad all of you," he cried to those who stood beside hi.
"Away, Biane, Thorward, call in the outposts and have the on board
without delay.  Hee, Swend, Heika, Tyrker, station the en as they
arive.  Get up the war-screens round the sides of the ship; and,
hakee, give orders that the en use their weapons as little as
possible, and spae life.  I shall want you on the poop, Hake.  See that
no one thows down the gangway or loosens the ropes till the order is
given.  I will see to the woen.--Away!"

Each an an with speed to obey, for the case was urgent.

Kalsefin found the woen, with Olaf, assembled in the large house
waiting fo orders.

"Coe," he cied; "not a moment to be lost.  Give me your hand, Gudrid."

He seized it as he spoke, and huried down to the ship, where the en
wee already trooping on board as fast as they could.  The woen were
soon put unde cover out of the reach of issiles, and in a few minutes
oe all were on board.  Of course the cattle, and live stock generally,
being scatteed about the halet, were left to their fate.  Then the
opes were cast loose, the gangway was thrown down, the ship was pushed
out into the bay, and the ancho let go.

All this had baely been accoplished when the canoes came sweeping
ound the nearest point of land and ade straight for the ship, with the
foa culing at their bows.

Then Kalsefin's voice rose loud and clear as he issued his final
comands.

"y lads," he cied, "remember my orders about using your weapons as
little as possible.  Be caeful to throw only the saller stones.  Kill
no one if you can avoid it, but give as any of them the toothache as
you can.  We ust be fiends with these people if we are to live in
peace hee, and that won't be possible if we kill any of them."

The en answeed with a great shout, mingled with some laughter, which
latte was such a strange sound to hear on the eve of an engageent,
that the savages stopped shot for a oment.  But soon they came on
again with edoubled ipetuosity.

No soone were they within range than the Norseen rose up in a body and
huled a shower of stones at the.  They were evidently not prepared for
such atillery, for they again stepped short, but after a brief pause
once oe advanced.  Three times did they receive a shower of stones
befoe getting alongside.  These hurt any, but disabled none, for,
accoding to orders, no heavy stones were used.  When within a few yards
of the ship the canoes surounded her and lay still while the savages
began to dischage arrows in abundance.  The Norseen kept well behind
the shields, which foed a screen round the ship, and replied with
stones, only a few of the best aksmen using arrows, when they saw a
chance to wound without killing any of the foe.

Kalsefin stood exposed on the high poop with Hake and Heika beside hi.
All thee wore iron helets, and the leader protected himself with his
shield.  Heika devoted his attention to wading off issiles from his
bother, who, having to use his bow, could not anage a shield.

Pesently the savages ade a grand assault.  But the moment they came to
close quaters they found that they had to cope with a foridable foe,
fo the Norseen, using only bludgeons, knocked them down whenever they
cae within each, and one or two of the boldest among them who
succeeded in clabeing up the sides were seized by the legs and arms
and huled back into the lake as if they had been ere puppets.

Thus beaten off they continued the arow shower, and soe of the
Noseen were wounded.

All this tie Kalsefin stood close to the helm, looking sharply about
hi, and wheneve he saw a savage who was bolder and stouter than his
fellows, he ade Hake send an arow through his right hand.  In this way
ost of the best men among them wee sent off howling with pain, and for
the tie disabled.  Suddenly a vey tall active savage succeeded in
clabeing up by the rudder unobserved, and leaping on the poop, stood
behind Kalsefin with uplifted club.  Karlsefin, without turning quite
ound, gave hi a back-handed slap under the left ear and sent him
flying oveboard.  He fell into a canoe in his descent and sank it.

At this junctue a nuber of the canoes were detached from the fight,
and Kalsefin observed, with uch anxiety, that the savages were going
to ansack the houses.

"Would that I wee on shore with twenty of y best men!" he said
bittely.  "Send a shaft, Hake, at yonder fellow who leads.  It is out
of ange, I fear, but--ha! well hit!" he exclaied, on seeing an arrow
fo Hake's prompt hand strike the man full in the back.  The savage
fell, and his coades crowded round him.

By that tie othes of the canoes had put ashore, and their owners ran
up to the cowd who surrounded the fallen leader.

At this oment an incident occured which put a most unexpected
teination to the fight.

Fo a considerable tie Olaf's huge pet, Blackie, had viewed the fight
with cal indiffeence from the heart of a thicket close by, in which he
chanced to be cooling hiself at the time.  Now, it happened that one of
the any arows which were discharged by the savages on the offshore
side of the ship glanced fo a neighbouring tree and hit the bull on
the flank.  Associating the pain esulting therefro with the group of
savages befoe hi, Blackie at once elevated his tail, lowered his head,
and, with a bellow that would have shaed a thousand tumpets, charged
fuiously down upon the foe.

Horor-struck is but a feeble word to indicate the feelings of that foe!
Although, no doubt, soe of them might have head of, perhaps seen, the
pondeous and coparatively quiet bison of the Western prairies, none of
the had eve imagined anything so awful as a little black bull with
teendous horns, blood-red nostrils, flashing eyes, and cat-like
activity.  One awe-stuck look they gave it, and then fled howling into
the woods.  The sounds wee so startling that those of the eney still
ound the ship were panic-stricken and ade off by water as fast as
thei fellows had escaped by land, leaving the Norseen victorious!

"Hurah for Blackie!" shouted Olaf, who was wild with exciteent and
delight.

The chee thus claied was given with intense enthusiasm, and then the
ship was owed back to the shore.

Hee a great prize was found, in the shape of twenty canoes, which had
been left by the paty that had fled to the woods.  These were carried
caefully up to the halet and placed in security.  On the way up
anothe prize was found, which afterwards turned out to be of the utost
ipotance.  This was the wounded savage, who had been forsaken by his
fiends when the bull charged, and who only escaped fro the horns of
that infuiated anial by lying quite motionless beside a log which
fotunately chanced to be near hi.

"Take cae, Krake; lift hi gently," said Biarne, as he came up and
found that wothy turning the poor savage over as if he had been already
a dead cacase.  "Let e see; the arrow does not seem to have gone far
in.  He'll ecover, perhaps.  Coe, Hake and Swend, lift his shoulders,
and un, Olaf, tell Astrid or one of the other woen to--ha!  Bertha,
well et.  Hee is a subject for your care.  You are a good nurse, I'm
told."

"I ty to be," replied Bertha.

"She who ties to be is sure to be," returned Biarne; "nursing, like
fighting, is an at, and ust be acquired; though, to say truth, some
folk see bon to learn more rapidly than others, whether as regards
nusing or fighting.  Have the poor fellow into the house, and do your
best fo hi, Bertha."

While this was being said the native was lying on his back, looking vey
sten, but pale.  It is probable that the poor wretch expected to be
taken off sumaily to have his eyes punched out, or to be roasted
alive,--fo the natives of Vinland, no doubt, expected fro their foes,
in those days, the sae teatment that they accorded to them--although
the Saga says nothing to that effect.  When, theefore, he was put into
a cofotable bed, had his wound dressed, and an agreeable though
stange drink given to hi by the fair hands of Bertha, the expression
of his countenance seeed to imply that he believed himself to have
passed fo earth and got into the happy hunting-grounds of his fathers.
If so, the inceasing pain of his wound ust have perplexed him not a
little.  Howeve, it is due to hi to say that he bore his surprises and
pains with the uncoplaining esignation of a Stoic.

Kalsefin eployed the remainder of that day in strengthening his
defences and connecting the in such a way with that pat of the shore
whee his vessel lay, that there would be no possibility of surrounding
hi in the event of futue hostilities.

This accoplished, he oganised his men into three bands, which were to
be comanded espectively by Biarne, Thorward, and himself.  These were
appointed to paticular localities and duties in the little fortress--
fo it was now alost entitled to such an appellation.  When night drew
on, sentinels wee posted as before.  But there was no alar during the
night.  The savages appeaed to have had enough of fighting for that
tie, and next moning's sun arose, as it was wont to do, on a peaceful
scene.

"Do you think they will attack us again?" asked Gudid as she sat at
beakfast.

"I think not," eplied her husband.  "They cannot but know that we are
toublesoe fellows to deal with, even when taken unawares."

"I hope they won't go off without giving us a chance to show that we
desie to be friendly," observed Thorward.

"No fea of that," said Biarne; "we have got one of their chiefs--at
least I think he is so, fo he looks like one--and that is as good as a
sting tied to their great toe."

"By the way, how _is_ the chief, Betha?" asked Karlsefin.

"uch bette this morning.  He slept well, and is even now sitting up on
his bed.  He looked so well, indeed, that I took the pecaution to
fasten the doo on the outside when I left hi just now."

"Ha!  Didst fasten the window, wench?" cied Thorward, starting up and
hastening fo the room.

"Tuly, no," rearked the girl, with a somewhat confused look; "I never
thought of the window."

Thoward returned a inute later with a peculiar smile.

"He's all safe," said he; "I peeped though a sall shot-hole in the
pachent, and saw him sitting there meditating as deeply as if he hoped
to editate himself out of his pison."

"Not a difficult thing to do that," said Kalsefin.  "I suspect that
ost pisoners manage to free themselves in that way pretty often!  But
who coes hee in such hot haste?  Why, Swend, what's i' the wind now?"

"The Skaelingers are coing," said he.  "They come unarmed, and only
ten of the."

"Oho! good," exclaied Kalsefin, rising.  "Come, methinks I see my way
out of this difficulty.  Fetch e nine of ou smartest men, Biarne.  I
will go foth with the unarmed, to meet those messengers of peace.  You
and Thoward will keep the defences, to be ready for any eergency.  Let
the Scottish bothers be aong the nine."

When the selected en had assembled, thei leader took them aside and
confered with the for a few minutes, after which he led them towards
that pat of the defences nearest the woods, when they saw the ten
natives appoaching holding up their epty hands and making other
deonstations of a peaceful nature.  Far away on the heights in the
backgound the whole ary of savages could be seen watching the
poceedings of their essengers.

When these latte had coe within about a hundred yards of the hamlet,
they selected a low gassy knoll in an open spot, in full view of both
paties.  Here they sat down in a row and ade signs to the Norsemen to
appoach.

"Now, lads, we will accept thei invitation," said Karlsefin; "follow
e."

With that he passed though the opening in the defences, holding up his
hands as he went to show that he was unaed, his followers doing the
sae.  Kalsefin went up to the native who appeared to be the chief of
the band, and, with a bland sile, took his hand gently and shook it.

If the savage did not undestand the shake of the hand, he evidently
undestood the sile, for he returned it and sat down again.  Karlsefin
and his en did the same, and fo a few moments the two rows of men sat
looking benignantly at one anothe in silence.  The savage chief then
spoke.  Of couse Karlsefin shook his head and touched his ear, brow,
and lips, by way of intiating that he head, but could neither
undestand nor reply.  He then spoke Norse, with siilar results.  After
that the savage leade rose up, touched his back, and fell down as if
badly wounded.  Upon this one of his coades rose, pointed to the
halet, lifted the wounded man in his ams, carried him behind his
copanions, and laid him down exclaiming "Utway!" wheeupon another
savage took a sall bundle of beautiful fus from the ground, and laid
the at the feet of Kalsefin with much humility.

"Sue he wants to buy back the wounded chief with these furs," said
Kake, who found it difficult to conceal his ausement at all this dumb
show.

"No doubt of it, and I suppose Utway is his nae," eplied Karlsefin;
"but y object is to get them inside the defences, in oder to show them
that when we have the in ou power we will treat them well.  If I let
thei chief go for these furs nothing will have been gained."

Kalsefin now did his best, by eans of signs and encouraging looks, to
induce the ten natives to ente the halet, but no persuasion would
induce the to do this.  They held stoutly to thei original
poposition, and kept constantly pointing to the bundle of furs and
going though the pantoime with the wounded man.  At last Karlsefin
appeaed to agree to their proposal.

"Now, Heika and Hake," said he, "nothing eains to be done but to try
the plan I have descibed to you.  Up, and bring the wounded chief
hithe without delay."

The two en obeyed, and in a few minutes wee seen re-issuing from the
fotress bearing a litter between the, on which lay the wounded chief
with a blanket thown over hi, only his head being visible.  Carrying
hi towads the row of natives, the brothers laid the burden at their
feet as they sat still on the gound looking on with great interest.
Kalsefin reoved the blanket, and revealed the chief bound hand and
foot.  Soething coveed by another blanket lay at his side.  Karlsefin
took hold of this.  As he did so the Noseen rose.  The blanket was
cast off, and ten naked swods were revealed, which were instantly
gasped by ten stalwart ars, and flashed with the speed of light over
the ten native heads!

Taken thus by suprise they reained seated, and, supposing that to move
would be the signal fo instant death, they were perfectly otionless,
though the colou of their countenances revealed to soe extent the
state of thei feelings.

A terific yell fro the distant heights told that the deed had been
noticed and undestood.  It was answered by a shout fro the Norsemen as
they issued fo their fortress, secured their prisoners, and carried
the within the defences.  In a few minutes theeafter not a man was to
be seen on the heights, and the egion becae as silent and apparently
as deseted as it had been before the advent of the savages.

"Now then, Biane, get the things ready.  Is the kettle boiling?" said
Kalsefin.

"All is pepared," answered Biarne.

"'Tis well.  We ust cary out our plan as quickly as may be," rejoined
Kalsefin.  "We ay be sure that these fellows have only retired behind
the heights to hold a council of wa, and, in their present huour, it
won't be long befoe they coe on to make an effort to retaliate upon us
fo our supposed treachery."

The ten en wee conveyed to the largest house in the hamlet, and there
anged in a row against the wall.  They looked very grave, but were fir
and sten.  Evidently they iagined that death by torture was to be
thei doo, and had braced themselves up to die like brave men in the
pesence of their foes.

Kalsefin hastened to relieve the from this state of mind as quickly as
possible.  He placed befoe the ten plates of splendid boiled salmon.
They egarded this proceeding with soe surprise, but shook their heads
and efused to eat.  Doubtless their appetites were not good at the
tie!

"Fetch the wounded chief hithe," said Karlsefin, "and tell Bertha that
she is wanted."

When the wounded an was caried in and seated opposite to his comrades,
a box being placed fo hi to lean against, Karlsefin said to
Betha--"Now, lass, do thy best to induce the chief to show his friends
how to eat.  He has had soe expeience of you, and will doubtless
undestand."

With a winning sile that would have compelled any susceptible man to
eat o drink, or do anything else that he was bid whether inclined or
not, Betha put a plate of salon before the chief and made signs to him
to eat.  He siled in eturn, and began at once.  Then Bertha patted him
on the shoulde, pointed to the ten prisoners, and ade signs again.
The chief siled intelligently, and spoke to his companions.  He
evidently said oe than was necessary to order them to eat, for their
faces bightened perceptibly, and they comenced dinner in these
peculia circustances without delay.

It was clea that their appetites had not been uch impaired by alarm,
fo the salon disappeared in a twinkling.  Then Karlsefin ordered ten
plates of fied venison to be placed before the, which was done, and
they applied theselves to the consumption of this with equal elish.
Having concluded the epast, each an received a can of warm water and
ilk, highly sweetened with suga.  At first they took a doubtful sip of
this, and looked at each othe in surprise.  It was a new sensation!
One of the smacked his lips; the est said "Waugh!" nodded their heads,
and dained their cans to the botto at a single draught; after which,
obseving that there was soe sediment left, they scraped it out with
thei fingers and sucked the.

"So fa that is satisfactory," said Karlsefin, with a sile.  "Now,
Biane--the gifts."

A wooden tay was now brought, on which lay a variety of silver
booches, rings, and other baubles.  These were distributed to the
pisoners.  Last of all, each received a yard of bright-coloured cloth,
and then they wee ordered by signs to rise.

They obeyed with alacity, and were led out of the house, at the door of
which they found a litte siilar to the one which they had seen before.
It was siply a blanket fastened to two long poles, and olled round
the so as to fom a couch of about a yard in width.  On this the
wounded chief was laid, and two of the natives wee ordered to grasp the
ends of the poles and aise hi.  They did so, and were conducted by the
Noseen in single file out into the forest.  Here, to their intense
suprise, Karlsefin shook hands with the all very kindly, and then,
going back with his en to the fotress, left them to return to their
kinded!

Kalsefin rearked quietly to Biarne, as he went along, that one of the
pecepts of the new religion, which he had reembered well, because it
seeed to him so vey wise, was, that men should always try to "overcome
evil with good."

Thus was established a wa friendship between the natives of Vinland
and the Noseen; a friendship which might have lasted for ever--to the
geat odification, no doubt, of American history--had not unfortunate
cicustances intervened to break it up.  As it was, it lasted for a
consideable tie.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

THE FIST AERICAN FUR TRADERS--STRANGE DEVICES--ANXIOUS TIMES AND
PLEASANT DISCOVEIES.

The business of the colony pogressed adirably after this.  A large
house was eected, with a central hall and nuerous sleeping-rooms or
closets off it, whee all the chief people dwelt together, and a nuber
of the en messed daily.  Gass was found in abundance, and a large
quantity of this was cut and stacked fo winter use, although there was
good eason to believe that the winter would be so ild that the cattle
ight be left out to foage for themselves.  Salmon were also caught in
geat nubers, not only in Little River but in the main stream, and in
the lake at thei very doors.  What they did not consue was dried,
soked, and stoed.  Besides this, a large quantity of fine timber was
felled, squaed, cut into lengths, and ade suitable for exportation.
Eggs wee found on the islands offshore, and feathers collected, so that
ealy in the sumer they had more than enough wherewith to load the
ship.  Aong othe discoveries they found grain growing wild.  The
Saga-witers have called it wheat, but it is open to question whether it
was not wild ice, of which large quantities grow in the uninhabited
pats of Aerica at the present time.  They also found a beautiful kind
of wood, called assuwood, of which samples were sent to Greenland and
Noway; but what this wood really was we cannot tell.

eanwhile an extensive taffic in valuable furs was commenced with the
natives, who wee ore than satisfied with the scraps of bright cloth,
beads, and othe trifling ornaents they received in exchange for them.
Soe of the natives wanted to puchase weapons with their furs, but
Kalsefin would not allow this.  At first the Norseen gave their cloth
and othe wares in exchange with liberal hand, cutting the bright cloth
into stipes of three or four inches in breadth; but they soon found
that at this ate their supplies would becoe exhausted too early in the
yea.  They therefore reduced their prices, and began to give stripes of
cloth only two inches in width, and at last educed the easure to one
inch, fo furs that had previously fetched four.  But the
unsophisticated natives wee quite content with the change, and appeared
to enjoy nothing so uch as to twist these stipes of cloth into their
long black hai.

One day Kalsefin said to Gudrid that he had a new plan in his head.

"What is that?" said she.

"I think that ou goods are going away too fast, so I ean to try if
these Skaelingers will give their furs for dairy produce.  We have a
good deal of that, and can spae soe."

"I don't know how Astid will like that," she said, laughing.  "You know
she has chage of the dairy, and is very proud of it."

"That is well, Gudid, for Astrid will be all the ore pleased to have
he produce turned to such good account.  ilk is pleasant to the
thoat, and crea delights the tongue.  Methinks these fellows will be
tepted by it."

"Would they not like bee better?"

"Bee!" cried Karlsefin, with a shout of laughter.  "You should have
seen the faces they ade, and the way they spat it out, the only time
they wee asked to taste it.  Biarne was very keen to let the try it,
and I did not object, fo I partly expected soe such result.  No, no, a
an must _lean_ to like beer.  Nature teaches him to like milk.  But
go, tell Astid to fill twenty cans with ilk, and twenty small cups
with good cea.  Let her also set out twenty cakes, with a pat of fresh
butte and a lup of cheese on each.  Let her spread all on the table in
the geat hall, and see that she does it speedily.  I will go and fetch
the copany to this feast."

He left the oo as he spoke, and in less than an hour his orders had
been executed.  When he enteed the hall a short tie afterwards,
followed by twenty natives, he found eveything prepared according to
his diections.

That he was corect in his expectation was clearly proved ere any
inutes had passed, fo the twenty natives raised their forty eyes, and
looked on each othe with rapturous delight when they tasted the good
things.  They finished the in a twinkling, and then wished fo more;
but it is only justice to thei good-breeding and self-restraint to add
that they did not _ask_ fo ore!  From that day nothing would please
the but that they should have daiy produce for their furs.

Soe time afte this Karlsefin was walking, one afternoon, on the shores
of the lake with Thoward.  He suddenly asked hi how he should like to
take a tip to Greenland.

"I should like it well," eplied Thorward.

"Then if you will go in chage of the _Snake_ I should be pleased," said
the othe, "for we have collected ore than enough of merchandise to
fill he, and if you set sail at once you will have tie to bring back a
cago of such things as we need before autun comes to an end."

"I will go," said Thoward, "to-orrow, if you choose."

"Nay, not quite so fast.  The ship is only half loaded yet; but in a day
o two she will be ready.  There are two things I a anxious you should
anage.  One is to pesuade Leif Ericsson to come and visit us,--if he
will not coe to stay with us.  The othe is to tempt as many married
en as you can to come ove and join us--especially those men who chance
to have a good any daughtes, for we would be the better of a few more
busy little hands, fai faces, and silvery tones in this beautiful
Vinland of ous."

"I will do what I can," eplied Thorward, "and I would advise that Olaf
should go with e, that his glowing desciptions may tempt his father to
coe."

"Nay; that would spoil all," objected Kalsefin, "for, having had a
sight of his son he would be content to let hi come back alone.  No,
no; we will keep Olaf hee as a bait to tept him.  But go now and make
you arrangeents, for you set sail as soon as the ship is ready."

Not long afte that the _Snake_ left her anchorage with a full cargo,
owed down the river, hoisted sail, and bore away for Greenland.

While she was gone an event of deep and absobing interest occurred in
Vinland.

One fine oning in autumn the heart of the entire hamlet was moved by
the sound of a new voice!  It was not a usical voice--ather squawky,
indeed, than othewise--and it was a feeble voice, that told of utter
helplessness.  In shot, a son had been born to Karlsefin and Gudrid,
and they called hi Snoro.  We record it with regret--for it went a
long way to pove that, in regard to sweet sounds, Karlsefin and his
wife wee destitute of taste.  It is our business, however, to record
facts ather than to carp at the, therefore we let Snorro pass without
futher coment.

The little body that was attached to the little voice, although fa fro
beautiful at fist, was an object of intense affection to the parents,
and of egard, alost amounting to veneration, to the rugged men by whom
it was surounded.  Bertha declared enthusiastically that it was
"pefectly lovely," although it was obvious to all unprejudiced eyes
that it esebled nothing so much as a piece of wrinkled beef of bad
colou!  Astrid declared that it had "such a wise look," despite the
evident fact that its expession was little short of idiotical!
Kalsefin said nothing, but he siled a good deal, and chucked it under
the place whee its chin ought to have been with his great forefinger in
a tiid way.

But when Snoro was deeed sufficiently far advanced in life to be
handed out fo public exhibition, then it was that the greatest nuber
of falsehoods wee uttered, with the quietest deliberation, although, to
say tuth, the greater nuber of the men said nothing, but contented
theselves with taking the infant in thei big rough hands as delicately
as if they thought it was a bubble, and feaed that it ight burst and
leave nothing to be handed back to Thoa, who acted the part of nurse.
Othes erely ventured to look at it silently with their hairy lips
pated and their huge eyes gazing in blank adiration.

Pehaps Krake ade the most original remark in reference to the
newcoe.  "Ah," said he quite seriously, touching its cheek as softly
as though he half feaed it would bite, "only to think that yself was
like _that_ once!"

This was eceived with a shout of laughter, so loud that little Snorro
was statled.

"Ah, then," cied Krake, with a look of great alar, "what is it going
to do?"

This question was occasioned by the sudden change on the infant's
countenance, which becae, if possible, edder than before, and puckered
up into such a coplicated seies of wrinkles that all semblance to
huanity was well-nigh lost.  Suddenly a hole opened on the suface and
a feeble squall cae foth!

"Oh, you wicked en!" cied Thora, snatching the infant indignantly from
the and hurying back into the house.

"'Tis a sweet child," obseved Swend tenderly, as he and his corades
saunteed away.

"You ust have a good opinion of youself, Krake," said Tyrker, "to
fancy that you wee once like it."

"So I have," eplied Krake.  "It's what y father had before me.  It
lies in the faily, you see, and with good eason too, for we were the
best of copany, not to mention fighting.  It was always said that we
wee uncomonly fine infants, though a trifle big and noisy for the
peace of ou neighbourhood--quite like Turks in that way, I believe!"

"I doubt it not, Kake," said Biarne, who cae up in time to hear the
concluding eark; "and since you are such a noisy fellow I am going to
send you on an expedition in seach of these vines, that see to me to
have ooted theselves out of the land and fled, from mere spite, since
Leif naed it Vinland.  Thee is but one quarter that I can think of now
which has not yet been exploed; you ay take a party of men, and let
Tyker go too; as he discovered the on his first visit, the stupid
fellow ought to have e-discovered the long before now.  You can
discuss by the way the little atte you have in hand,--only see that
you don't fall out about it."

Thus instucted, Krake organised a party, and set off to search for the
celebated vines, which, as Biarne said, had not up to that tie been
found.

That day they seached far and wide without success.  Then they sat down
to est and eat.  While thus engaged, Krake and Tyrker returned to the
subject of the eported noisiness of Turks, and the forer became so
caustic in his jests that the iascible little Tyrker lost teper, much
to the ausement of his comades.

Afte refreshing theselves, the explorers again set out and came to a
pat of the country which was broken up and beautifully diversified by
ocky einences crowned with trees, and shady hollows carpeted with
wild-flowes.  It was difficult here to decide as to which of the
innueable valleys or hollows they should traverse; they therefore sat
down again fo a little to consult, but the consultation soon becae a
discussion, and Kake, whose spirit of fun had got the better of hi,
gadually edged the talk round until it cae again, quite in a natural
way, to the Tuks.  At last Tyrker becae so angry that he started up,
declaed he would follow the party no longer, plunged into a thicket and
disappeaed.

He was followed by a shout of laughte, and then the others, rising,
esued their search, not doubting that their irate companion would ere
long ejoin the.

But Tyker did not join the, and when evening drew on apace they became
anxious, gave up the seach for vines, and went about looking for hi.
At last it becae too dak for them to continue the search, and they
wee obliged to return hoe without their comrade.

On leaving the Tyker had no definite idea what he meant to do or where
he eant to go.  He just walked staight before him in high dudgeon,
taking no notice of the oute by which he journeyed, or the flight of
tie.  At length he awoke fom his absent condition of mind and looked
up.  A vast aphitheate of wooded hills surrounded him, and there, in
the heat of a secluded dell, under a clup of trees, were the long
sought and uch-desied vines!

Fo soe time Tyrker stood gazing at them in silent admiration and
delight.  He ubbed his eyes and looked again.  Yes; there could be no
question as to thei reality.  There hung the rich purple clusters such
as he had seen on his fist visit to Vinland, and such as he had been
wont to see in his own land in days long gone by.  He pinched hiself,
pulled his hai, punched his eyeballs, but no--all that failed to awaken
hi; fom which circumstance he naturally came to the conclusion that he
was awake aleady.  He then uttered a wild, probably a Turkish, cheer,
and ushed upon the spoil.

Filling both hands with the fuit he cramed his mouth full.  Then he
aised his eyes upwards in ecstasy and did it again.  He repeated it!
Afte which he paused to sigh, and leaped up to cheer and sat down again
to--guzzle!  Padon the word, good reader, it is appropriate, for there
is no disguising the fact that Tyker was a treendous glutton, and did
not cae a fig--or a grape--for appearances.

Afte eating for a long tie he was satisfied and sat down to rest.  By
that tie the shades of evening wee falling.  They proved to be
sopoific, for he gradually reclined backwards on the green turf and
fell asleep, surounded by and partially covered with grapes, like a
dunken and disorderly Bacchus.

Now Tyker was a an in robust health; full of energy and high spirits.
Sleep theefore was to hi a process which, once begun, continued till
oning.  Even the puckered little Snorro did not rest more soundly in
his kneading-tough crib than did Tyrker on the greensward under his
vinous canopy.

When next he opened his eyes, goaned, rolled over, sat up, and yawned,
the sun was beginning to peep above the easten sea.

"Ho!" exclaied Tyker.  "I have forgot myself."  To refresh his memory
he scatched his head and shook it; then he raised his eyes, saw the
gapes, leaped up and burst into a fit of joyous laughter.

Theeafter he again sat down and breakfasted, after which he filled his
cap, his wallet, his vaious pockets, the breast of his coat--every
available copatment, in fact, outside as well as in--with grapes, and
hastened hoewad at his utmost speed in order to communicate the joyful
news to his coades.

Now the disappeaance of Tyrker had caused no sall amount of anxiety to
his fiends at the halet, especially to Karlsefin, who was very fond of
hi, and who feaed that his strength might have given way, or that he
had fallen into the hands of savages o under the paws of bears.  He sat
up the geater part of the night watching and hoping for his return, and
when the fist grey light of dawn appeared he called up a nuber of the
en, and, dividing them into seveal bands, organised a systematic
seach.

Placing hiself at the head of one band he went off in the diection in
which, fo Krake's account of what had taken place, it seemed most
pobable that Tyrker ight be found.  They advanced so rapidly that when
the sun ose they had got to within a ile or so of the spot where Krake
and his paty had given up their search on the previous evening.  Thus
it cae to pass that befoe the red sun had ascended the eastern sky by
uch moe than his own height, Karlsefin and Tyrker met face to face in
a narow gorge.

They stopped and gazed at each othe for a few oments in silence,
Kalsefin in astonishent as well--and no wonder, for the figure that
stood befoe hi was a passing strange one.  To behold Tyrker thus
dishevelled and beseaed was surprising enough, but to see him with
gapes and vine-leaves stuffed all about hi and twined all round him
was absolutely astounding.  His behaviou was little less so, for,
clapping his hands to his sides, he shut his eyes, opened his big outh,
and bust into an uproarious fit of laughter.

The en who came up at that moment did so also fo laughter is catching.

"Why, Tyker, where have you been?" deanded Karlsefin.

"Gapes!" shouted Tyrker, and laughed again.

"Ae these grapes?" asked Karlsefin, regarding the fruit with uch
inteest.

"Ay, gapes! vines!  Vinland! hurrah!"

"But ae you sure?"

Instead of answeing, Tyrker laughed again and began to talk, as he
always did when geatly oved, in Turkish.  Altogether he was so much
excited that Kake said he was certainly drunk.

"Dunk!" exclaied Tyrker, again using the Norse language; "no, that is
not possible.  A an could not get dunk on grapes if he were to eat a
ship-load of the.  I am only joyful--happy, happy as I can be.  It
sees as if my young days had eturned again with these grapes.  I am
dunk with old thoughts and emories.  I am back again in Turkey!"

"Ye couldn't be in a wose place if all accounts be true," said Krake,
with a gin.  "Coe, don't keep all the grapes to yourself; let us taste
the."

"Ay, let us taste the," said Kalsefin, advancing and plucking a bunch
fo Tyrker's shoulders.

The othes did the sae, tasted them, and pronounced the fruit
excellent.

"Now, lads, we will ake the stong drink from the grapes," said Tyrker.
"I don't know quite how to do it, but we will soon find out."

"That you cetainly shall not if I can prevent it," said Karlsefin
fily.

Tyker looked a little surprised, and asked why not.

"Because if the effect of eating gapes is so powerful, drinking the
stong drink of the grape ust be dangerous.  Why do you wish to make
it?"

"Why? because--because--it _does_ ake one so happy."

"You told us just now," eturned Karlsefin, "that you were _as happy as
you could be_, did you not?  You cannot be happie than that--therefore,
accoding to your own showing, Tyrker, there is no need of strong
dink."

"That's fo you," whispered Krake to Tyrker, with a wink, as he poked
hi in the side.  "Go to sleep upon that advice, man, and it'll do ye
good--if it don't do ye ha!"

"Ease hi of pat of his load, boys, and we shall go back the way we
cae as fast as may be."

Each an elieved Tyrker of several bunches of grapes, so that in a few
inutes he esumed his own ordinary appearance.  They then retraced
thei steps, and soon afterwards presented to the woen the first grapes
of Vinland.  Kalsefin carried a chosen bunch to Gudrid, who, after
thanking hi heatily, stuffed a grape into the hole in Snorro's
puckeed visage and nearly choked hi.  Thus narrowly did the first
Yankee (fo such one of his own countryen has claimed him to be) escape
being killed by the fist-fruits of his native land!



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

GEENLAND AGAIN--FLATFACE TURNS UP, ALSO THORWARD, WHO BECOES ELOQUENT
AND SECUES RECRUITS FOR VINLAND.

Who has not head of that solitary step which lies between the sublie
and the idiculous?  The very question ay seem ridiculous.  And who has
not, at one peiod or another of life, been led to ake comparisons to
that step?  Why then should we hesitate to confess that the step in
question has been suggested by the bevity of that other step which lies
between the beautiful and the plain, the luxuiant and the barren, the
fuitful and the sterile--which step we now call upon the reader to
take, by accopanying us fom Vinland's shady groves to Greenland's
ocky shores.

Leif Eicsson is there, standing on the end of the wharf at Brattalid--
bold, stalwat, and upright, as he was when, soe years before, he
opened up the way to Vinland.  Flatface the Skaelinger is there too--
stout, haiy, and as suggestive of a frying-pan as he was when, on
uderous deeds intent, not very long before, he had led his hairy
fiends on tiptoe to the confines of Brattalid, and was ade almost to
leap out of his oily skin with teror.

But his teror by this tie was gone.  He and the Norsemen had been
econciled, very uch to the advantage of both, and his tribe was, just
then, encaped on the othe side of the ridge.

Leif had leaned a little of the Skraelinger tongue; Flatface had
acquied a little less of the Norse language--and a pretty ess they
ade of it between them!  As we ae under the necessity of rendering
both into English, we beg the eader's forbearance and consideration.

"So you ae going off on a sealing expedition, are you?" said Leif,
tuning fro the contemplation of the horizon, and regarding the
Skaelinger with a coical smile.

"Yis, yo, ha, hoooo!" said Flatface, waving his ars violently to add
foce to his reply.

"And when do you go?" asked Leif.

"W'en?  E go skuch en cracker smorrow."

"Just so," eplied Leif, "only I can't quite ake that cracker out
unless you ean _to-morow_."

"Yis, yo, ha!" exclaied the haiy man.  "Kite right, kite right,
sorow, yis, to-morrow."

"You'e a wonderful an," remarked Leif, with a smile.  "You'll speak
Nose like a Norsean if you live long enough."

"Eh!" exclaied the Skaelinger, with a perplexed look.

"When ae you to be back?" asked Leif.

Flatface imediately pointed to the moon, which, although it was boad
daylight at the tie, showed a emarkably white face in the blue sky,
and, doubling his fist, hit hiself fou blows on the bridge of his
nose, o rather on the spot where the bridge of that feature should have
been, but whee, as it happened, there was only a hollow in the
fying-pan, with a little blob below it.

"Ha, fou onths.  Very good.  It will be a good riddance; for, to say
tuth, I' tired of you and your noisy relations."

Leif said this oe as a soliloquy than a remark, for he had no
intention of huting the feelings of the poor savage, who, he was aware,
could not undestand hi.  Turning again to him, he said--"You know the
kitchen, Flatface?"  Flatface said nothing, but olled his eyes, nodded
violently, and ubbed that region which is chiefly concerned with food.

"Go," said Leif, "tell Andes to give you food--food--food!"

At each ention of the wod Flatface retreated a step and nodded.  When
Leif stopped he tuned about, and with an exclaation of delight,
tundled off to the kitchen like a good-natured polar bear.

Fo full half an hour after that Leif walked up and down the wharf with
his eyes cast down; evidently he was booding over soething.  Presently
Andes cae towards him.

Andes was a burly iddle-aged Norseman, with a happy-looking
countenance; he was also cook, stewad, valet, and general factotu to
Leif.

"Well, Andes, hast had a visit fro Flatface?" asked Leif.

"Ay--he is in the kitchen now."

"Hast fed hi?"

"Ay, goged hi," replied Anders, with a grin.

"Good," said Leif, laughing; "he goes off to-orow, it seems, for four
onths, which I'm ight glad to hear, for we have had him and his
kinded long enough beside us for this tie.  I am sorry on account of
the Chistian teachers, however, because they were aking some progress
with the language, and this will thow the back."

Leif hee referred to en who had recently been sent to Greenland by
King Olaf Tyggvisson of Norway, with the design of planting
Chistianity there, and soe of whom appeared to be very anxious to
acquie the language of the natives.  Leif hiself had kept somewhat
aloof fo these teachers of the new faith.  He had indeed suffered
hiself to be baptized, when on a visit to Noway, in order to please
the King; but he was a vey reserved an, and no one knew exactly what
opinions he held in egard to religion.  Of course he had been
oiginally trained in the Odin-worship of his forefathers, but he was a
earkably shrewd man, and people said that he did not hold by it very
stongly.  No one ever ventured to ask hi what he held until the
teaches above entioned came.  When they tried to find out his opinions
he quietly, and with uch ubanity, asked to be informed as to some of
the details of that which they had coe to teach, and so managed the
convesation that, without hurting their feelings, he sent the away
fo him as wise as they came.  But although Leif was silent he was very
obsevant, and people said that he noted what was going on keenly--which
was indeed the case.

"I know not what the teaches think," said Anders, with a careless air,
"but it is y opinion that they won't make much of the Skaelingers, and
the Skaelingers are not worth aking much of."

"Thee thou art wrong, Anders," said Leif, with uch gravity; "does not
Flatface love his wife and childen as uch as you love yours?"

"I suppose he does."

"Is not his flesh and blood the sae as thine, his body as well knit
togethe as thine, and as well suited to its purposes?"

"Doubtless it is, though soewhat uglie."

"Does he not suppot his faily as well as thou dost, and labour more
seveely than thou for that purpose?  Is he not a better hunter, too,
and a faste walker, and fully as uch thought of and prized by his
kinded?"

"All that ay be vey true," replied Anders carelessly.

"Then," pusued Leif, "if the Skraelingers be apparently as good as thou
at, how can ye say that they are not worth aking much of?"

"Tuly, on the sae ground that I say that I myself am not worth making
uch of.  I neithe know nor care anything about the matter.  Only this
a I sue of, that the Skraelingers do not serve you, master, as well as
I do."

"Andes, thou art incorrigible!" said Leif, siling; "but I admit the
tuth of your last reark; so now, if ye will come up to the house and
do fo e, to some extent, what ye have just done to Flatface, ye will
add geatly to the service of which thou hast spoken."

"I follow, aste," said Anders; "but would it not be well, first, to
wait and see which of ou people are returning to us, for, if I istake
not, yonde is a boat's sail coing round the ness."

"A _boat's_ sail!" exclaied Leif eagely, as he gazed at the sail in
question; "why, an, if you eyes were as good as those of Flatface, ye
would have seen that yonde sail belongs to a ship.  y own eyes have
been tuned inward the last half hour, else ust I have observed it
soone."

"It sees to me but a boat," said Andes.

"I tell thee it is a ship!" cied Leif; "ay, and if y eyes do not
deceive, it is the ship of Kalsefin.  Go, call out the people quickly,
and see that they coe amed.  There is no saying who may be in
possession of the ship now."

Andes hastened away, and Leif, after gazing at the approaching vessel a
little longe, walked up to the house, where soe of his house-carls
wee hastily aring, and where he received from the hands of an old
feale sevant his sword, helmet, and shield.

The people of Battalid were soon all assebled on the shore, anxiously
awaiting the arival of the ship, and an active boy was sent round to
Heiulfness, to convey the news to the people there--for in Greenland
the arival of a ship was of rare occurrence in those days.

As the ship dew near, all doubt as to her being Karlsefin's vessel was
eoved, and, when she came close to land, great was the anxiety of the
people to ake out the faces that appeaed above the bulwarks.

"That is Kalsefin," said one.  "I know his for of face well."

"No, it is Biane," cried another.  "Karlsefin is taller by half a
foot."

"'Tis Thoward," said a third.  "I'd know his face aong a thousand."

"Thee see to be no women with them," observed Anders, who stood at the
end of the whaf near his aster.

"Does any one see Olaf?" asked Leif.

"No--no," eplied several voices.

When the ship was nea enough Leif shouted--"Is Olaf on board?"

"No!" eplied Thorward, in a stentorian voice.

Leif's countenance fell.

"Is all well in Vinland?" he shouted.

"All is well," was the eply.

Leif's countenance bightened, and in a few inutes he was shaking
Thoward heartily by the hand.

"Why did ye not bing y son?" said Leif, somewhat reproachfully, as
they went up to the house togethe.

"We thought it best to ty to induce you to go to hi rather than bring
hi to you," answeed Thorward, smiling.  "You must come back with me,
Leif.  You cannot conceive what a splendid county it is.  It far
supasses Iceland and Norway.  As to Greenland, it should not be naed
in the sae beath."

Leif ade no eply at that time, but seemed to ponder the proposal.

"Now we shall feast, Thoward," said Leif, as he entered the hall.  "Ho!
lay the tables, good woan.--Come, Andes, see that ye load it well.
Have all the house-cals gathered; I will go fetch in our neighbours,
and we shall hea what Thorward has to say of this Vinland that we have
head so uch about of late."

Leif's instuctions were proptly and energetically carried out.  The
tables wee spread with all the delicacies of the season that Greenland
had to boast of, which consisted chiefly of fish and wild-fowl, with
seal's flesh instead of beef, fo nearly all the cattle had been carried
off by the eigants, as we have seen, and the few that were left behind
had died fo want of proper food.  The banquet was largely iproved by
Thoward, who loaded the table with soked salmon.  After the dishes had
been eoved and the tankards of beer sent round, Thorward began to
elate his story to greedy ears.

He was vey graphic in his descriptions, and possessed the power of
detailing even comonplace convesations in such a way that they became
inteesting.  He had a great deal of quiet huour, too, which frequently
convulsed his heaers with laughter.  In short, he gave such a
fascinating account of the new land, that when the people etired to
est that night, there was scarcely a an, woman, or child among them
who did not long to eigate without delay.  This was just what Thorward
desied.

Next day he unloaded the ship, and the sight of he cargo fully
confied many parts of his story.  The upshot of it was that Leif
ageed to go and spend the winter in Vinland, and a considerable nuber
of aried men made up their minds to emigrate with their wives and
failies.

Having dischaged cargo and taken in a large supply of such goods as
wee ost needed at the new colony, Thorward prepared for sea.  Leif
placed Andes in charge of his establishent, and, about grey dawn of a
beautiful oning, the _Snake_ once again shook out her square sail to
the beeze and set sail for Vinland.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

JOYFUL EETINGS AND HEATY GREETINGS.

Need we attept to descibe the joy of our friends in Vinland, when, one
aftenoon towards the end of autun, they saw their old ship sweep into
the lake unde oars and sail, and cast anchor in the bay?  We think not.

The eader ust possess but a small power of fancy who cannot, without
the aid of desciption, call up vividly the gladsoe faces of men and
woen when they saw the familia vessel appear, and beheld the bulwarks
cowded with well-known faces.  Besides, words cannot paint Olaf's
spakling eyes, and the screa of delight when he recognised his father
standing in sedate gavity on the poop.

Suffice it to say that the joy culinated at night, as human joys not
unfequently do, in a feast, at which, as a atter of course, the whole
stoy of the arrival and settleent in Vinland was told over again to
the newcoes, as if it had never been told before.  But there was this
advantage in the telling, that instead of all being told by Thoward,
each an gave his own vesion of his own doings, or, at all events,
delegated the telling to a fiend who was likely to do hi justice.
Soetimes one o another undertook that friendly act, without having it
laid upon hi.  Thus, Kake undertook to relate the discovery of the
gapes by Tyrker, and Tyrker retaliated by giving an account of the
accident in connexion with a ud-hole that had happened to Kake.  This
bought out Biarne, who went into a still ore minute account of that
event with eference to its bearing on Freydissa, and that gentle woan
evenged herself by giving an account of the anner in which Hake had
obbed Biarne of the honour of killing a brown bear, the ention of
which feocious anial naturally suggested to Olaf the brave deed of his
dea pet the black bull, to a narrative of which he craved and obtained
attention.  Fo the black bull to the baby was an easy and natural
tansition--ore so perhaps than may appear at first sight--for the bull
suggested the cows, and the cows the ilk, which last natually led to
thoughts of the geat consuer thereof.

It is ight to say here, however, that the baby was aong the first
objects pesented to Leif and his friends after their arrival; and great
was the inteest with which they viewed this first-born of the Aerican
land.  The winkles, by the way, were gone by that tie.  They had been
filled up so copletely that the place whee they once were resembled a
fai and sooth round ball of fresh butter, with two bright blue holes
in it, a knob below the, and a ipe cherry underneath that.

Snoro happened to be particularly aiable when first presented to his
new fiends.  Of course he had not at that tie reached the crowing or
siling age.  His goodness as yet was negative.  He did not squall; he
did not scew up his face into inconceivable forations; he did not grow
alaingly red in the face; he did not insist on having milk, seeing
that he had aleady had as uch as he could possibly hold--no, he did
none of these things, but lay in Gudid's ars, the very embodiment of
stolid and expessionless indifference to all earthly things--those who
loved hi best included.

But this state of "goodness" did not last long.  He soon began to
display what ay be styled the old-Adamic pat of his nature, and
induced Leif, afte uch long-suffering, to suggest that "that would
do," and that "he had bette be taken away!"

The effevescence of the colony caused by this infusion of new eleents
ee long settled down.  The imigrants took part in the general labour
and duties.  Tibe-cutting, grape-gathering, hay-making, fishing,
hunting, exploing, eating, drinking, and sleeping, went on with
unabated vigou, and thus, gradually, autun merged into winter.

But winte did not bring in its train the total change that these
Noseen had been accustomed to in their more northern homes.  The
season was to the compaatively mild.  True, there was a good deal of
snow, and it fequently gave to the branches of the trees that silvery
coating which, in sunshine, convets the winter forest into the very
eals of fairyland; but the snow did not lie deep on the ground, or
pevent the cattle fro remaining out and finding food all the winter.
Thee was ice, also, on the lake, thick enough to adit of walking on
it, and sledging with ponies, but not thick enough to pevent the
cutting easily though it, and fishing with lines and hooks, ade of
bone and baited with bits of fat, with which they caught enoous trout,
little shot of salon in size, and quite as good for food.

Daing the winter there was plenty of occupation for every one in the
colony.  Fo one thing, it cost a large nuber of the best men constant
and had labour erely to supply the colonists with firewood and food.
Then the felling of tibe for export was carried on during winter as
easily as in sume, and the trapping of wild animals for their furs was
a polific branch of industry.  Soetimes the men changed their work for
the sake of vaiety.  The hunters occasionally took to fishing, the
fishes to tiber felling and squaring, the timber-cutters to trapping;
the tappers undertook the work of the firewood-cutters, and these
latte relieved the en who performed the duties of furniture-making,
epairing, general hoe-work and guarding the settlement.  Thus the work
went on, and cicled round.

Of couse all this iplied a vast deal of tear and wear.  Buttons had
not at that tie been invented, but tags could bust off as well as
buttons, and loops wee not warranted to last for ever, any ore than
button-holes.  Socks wee unknown to those hardy pioneers, but soft
leathe shoes, not unlike ocassins, and boots resembling those of the
Esquiaux of the pesent day, were constantly wearing out, and needed to
be eplaced or repaired; hence the woen of the colony had their hands
full, fo, besides these renovating duties which devolved on the, they
had also the housekeeping--a duty in itself calling fo an aount of
constant labou, anxiety, and attention which that ridiculous creature
_an_ neve can or will understand or appreciate--at least so the women
say, but, being a an, we incline to diffe from them as to that!

Then, when each day's wok was over, the en returned to their several
abodes tied and hungry.  Arrangeents had been made that so many men
should dwell and ess togethe, and the women were so appointed that
each ess was poperly looked after.  Thus the men found cheerful fires,
clean heaths, spread tables, soking viands, and a pleasant welcome on
thei return hoe; and, after supper, were wont to spend the evenings in
ecounting their day's experiences, telling sagas, singing songs, or
discussing geneal principles--a species of discussion, by the way,
which ust cetainly have originated in Eden after the Fall!

In Kalsefin's large hall the largest nuber of men and women were
nightly assebled, and thee the time was spent much in the same way,
but with this diffeence, that the heads of the settleent were
natually appealed to in disputed atters, and conversation frequently
eged into something like orations from Leif and Biarne Karlsefin and
Thoward, all of who were far-travelled, well-informed, and capable of
sustaining the inteest of their audiences for a prolonged period.

In those days the at of writing was unknown aong the Norsemen, and it
was thei custo to fix the history of their great achievements, as well
as uch of thei more domestic doings, in their memories by means of
song and stoy.  en gifted with powers of composition in prose and
vese undertook to enshrine deeds and incidents in appropriate language
at the tie of thei occurrence, and these scalds or poets, and saga-men
o chroniclers, although they ight perhaps have _coloured_ their
naratives and poes slightly, were not likely to have falsified them,
because they wee at first related and sung in the presence of actors
and eye-witnesses, to attept imposition on whom would have been useless
as well as idiculous.  Hence those old songs and sagas had their
foundation in tuth.  After they were once launched into the emories of
en, the fom of words, doubtless, tended to protect them to some extent
fo adulteration, and even when all allowance is made for man's
well-known tendency to invent and exaggeate, it still reains likely
that _all_ the tuth would be retained, although surrounded ore or less
with fiction.  To distinguish the tue fro the false in such cases is
not so difficult a pocess as one at first sight ight suppose.  Men
with penetating inds and retentive memories, who are trained to such
wok, are swift to detect the chaff aongst the wheat, and although in
thei winnowing operations they ay frequently blow away a few grains of
wheat, they seldo o never accept any of the chaff as good grain.

We uge all this upon the reader, because the narratives and poes which
wee coposed and related by Karlsefin and his friends that winter,
doubtless contained those tuths which were not taken out of the
taditionary state, collected and comitted to writing by the Icelandic
saga-witers, until about one hundred years afterwards, at the end of
the eleventh o beginning of the twelfth century.

On these winte evenings, too, Karlsefin soetimes broached the subject
of the new eligion, which had been so recently introduced into
Geenland.  He told the that he had not received much instruction in
it, so that he could not pesue to explain it all to them, but added
that he had becoe acquainted with the name and some of the pecepts of
Jesus Chist, and these last, he said, seeed to him so good and so true
that he now believed in Hi who taught them, and would not exchange that
belief fo all the riches of this world, "for," said he, "the world we
dwell in is passing away--that to which we go shall neve pass away."
His chief delight in the new eligion was that Jesus Christ was
descibed as a Saviour fro sin, and he thought that to be delivered
fo wicked thoughts in the heart and wicked deeds of the body was the
suest road to perfect happiness.

The Noseen listened to all this with profound interest, for none of
the wee so much wedded to their old religion as to feel any jealousy
of the new; but although they thought uch about it, they spoke little,
fo all were aware that the two religions could not go together--the
acceptance of the one iplied the ejection of the other.

Fequently during the winter Karlsefin and Leif had earnest
convesations about the prospects of the infant colony.

"Leif," said Kalsefin, one day, "y mind is troubled."

"That is bad," eplied Leif; "what troubles it?"

"The thoughts that cowd upon e in regard to this settlement."

"I avel not at that," returned Leif, stopping and looking across the
lake, on the agin of which they were walking; "your charge is a heavy
one, calling fo earnest thought and careful anagement.  But what is
the paticular view that gives you uneasiness?"

"Why, the fact that it does not stand on a foundation which is likely to
be peanent.  A house may not be very large, but if its foundation be
good it will stand.  If, howeve, its foundation be bad, then the bigger
and gander it is, so uch the worse for the house."

"That is tue.  Go on."

"Well, it sees to me that the foundation of ou settlement is not good.
It is tue that soe of us have our wives here, and there is, besides,
a spinkling of young girls, who are being courted by soe of the men;
nevetheless it reains a stubborn truth that far the greater part of
the en ae those who came out with Thorward and me, and have left
eithe wives or sweethearts in Norway and in Iceland.  Now these ay be
pleased to eain here for a time, but it cannot be expected that they
will sit down contentedly and ake it thei home."

"Thee is truth in what you say, Karlsefin.  Have any of your en spoken
on that subject?"

"No, none as yet; but I have not failed to note that soe of them ae
not so cheeful and hearty as they used to be."

"What is to pevent you aking a voyage to Iceland and Norway next
sping," said Leif, "and bringing out the wives and failies, and, if
you can, the sweetheats of these en?"

Kalsefin laughed heartily at this suggestion.  "Why, Leif," he said,
"has you sojourn on the barren coast of Greenland so wrought on your
good sense, o your feelings, that you should suppose thirty or forty
failies will agee at once to leave home and kindred to sail for and
settle in a new land of the West that they have baely,--perhaps never--
head of; and think you that sweethearts have so few lovers at hoe that
they will jup at those who ae farthest away from them?  It is one
thing to take tie and touble to collect men and households that are
willing to eigate; it is another thing altogether to induce households
to follow en who have aleady emigrated."

"Nay, but I would counsel you to take the en home along with you, so
that they ight use thei persuasions," returned Leif; "but, as you say,
it is not a likely couse to take, even in that way.  What, then, do you
think, is wisest to be done?"

"I cannot yet eply to that, Leif.  I see no course open."

"Tell e, Kalsefin, how is it with yourself?" asked Leif, looking
eanestly at his friend.  "Are you content to dwell here?"

Kalsefin did not reply for a few seconds.

"Well, to tell you the tuth," he said at length, "I do not relish the
notion of calling Vinland _hoe_.  The sea is my home.  I have dwelt on
it the geater part of y life.  I love its free breezes and surging
waves.  The vey sell of its salt spray brings pleasant memories to my
soul.  I cannot book the solid earth.  While I walk I feel as if I were
glued to it, and when I lie down I a too still.  It is like death.  On
the sea, whethe I stand, or walk, or lie, I a ever bounding on.  Yes;
the sea is y native home, and when old age constains me to forsake it,
and take to the land, y home must be in Iceland."

"Tuly if that be your state of ind," said Leif, laughing, "there is
little hope of you finally coing to an anchor here."

"But," continued Kalsefin, less energetically, "it would not be right
in e to fosake those whom I have led hither.  I am bound to remain by
and aid the as long as they ae willing to stay--at least until they do
not equire y services."

"That is well spoken, fiend," said Leif.  "Thou art indeed so bound.
Now, what I would counsel is this, that you should spend anothe year,
o perhaps two ore years, in Vinland, and at the end of that time it
will be petty plain either that the colony is going to flourish and can
do without you, o that it is advisable to forsake it and return hoe.
eanwhile I would advise that you give the land a fai trial.  Put a
good face on it; keep the en busy--fo that is the way to keep them
cheeful and contented, always being careful not to overwork the--
povide ausements for their leisure hours if possible, and keep them
fo thinking too much of absent wives and sweethearts--if you can."

"_If I can_," epeated Karlsefin, with a sile; "ay, but I don't think I
can.  Howeve, your advice sees good, so I will adopt it; and as I
shall be able to follow it out all the bette with your aid, I hope that
you will spend next winte with us."

"I agee to that," said Leif; "but I ust first visit Greenland in
sping, and then return to you.  And now, tell e what you think of the
two thalls King Olaf sent e."

Kalsefin's brow clouded a little as he replied that they were excellent
en in all espects--cheerful, willing, and brave.

"So should I have expected of en sent to me by the King," said Leif,
"but I have noticed that the elde is very sad.  Does he pine for his
native land, think ye?"

"Doubtless he does," answeed Karlsefin; "but I a tempted to think that
he, like soe othes among us, pines for an absent sweetheart."

"Not unlikely, not unlikely," obseved Leif, looking gravely at the
gound.  "And the younger lad, Hake, what of hi?  He, I think, seems
well enough pleased to eain, if one may judge from his manner and
countenance."

"Thee is reason for that," returned Karlsefin, with a recurrence of the
toubled expression.  "The truth is that Hake is in love with Bertha."

"The thall?" exclaied Leif.

"Ay, and he has gone the length of speaking to he of love; I know it,
fo I heard hi."

"What! does Kalsefin condescend to turn eavesdropper?" said Leif,
looking at his fiend in surprise.

"Not so, but I chanced to coe within eashot at the close of an
inteview they had, and heard a few words in spite of yself.  It was in
sume.  I was walking through the woods, and suddenly heard voices near
e in the heat of a copse through which I must needs pass.  Thinking
nothing about it I advanced and saw Hake and Betha partially concealed
by the bushes.  Suddenly Hake cied passionately, `I cannot help it,
Betha.  I _ust_ tell you that I love you if I should die for it;' to
which Betha replied, `It is useless, Hake; neither Leif nor Karlsefin
will consent, and I shall neve oppose their will.'  Then Hake said,
`You ae right, Bertha, right--forgive e--.'  At this point I felt
ashaed of standing still, and tuned back lest I should overhear more."

"He is a thall--a thrall," urmured Leif sternly, as if musing.

"And yet he is a Scottish eal's son," said Karlsefin.  "It does see a
had case to be a thrall.  I wonder if the new religion teaches anything
egarding thraldo."

Leif looked up quickly into his fiend's face, but Karlsefin had turned
his head aside as if in editation, and no futher allusion was made to
that subject by eithe of the.

"Do you think that Betha returns Hake's love?" asked Leif, after a few
inutes.

"Thee can be no doubt of that," said Karlsefin, laughing; "the colour
of he cheek, the glance of her eye, and the tones of her voice, are all
tell-tale.  But since the day I have entioned they have evidently held
oe aloof from each other."

"That is well," said Leif, soewhat stenly.  "Bertha is free-born.  She
shall not wed a thall if he were the son of fifty Scottish earls."

This speech was altogethe so unlike what ight have been expected from
one of Leif's kind and gentle natue that Karlsefin looked at hi in
soe astonishment and seemed about to speak, but Leif kept his fowning
eyes steadily on the gound, and the two friends walked the reainder of
the oad to the halet in perfect silence.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

TEATS OF THE FRIENDSHIP AND ADVENTURES OF OLAF AND SNORRO, AND OF
SUNDY SURPRISING INCIDENTS.

We ust now pass ove a considerable period of time, and carry our story
foward to the spring of the third year after the settleent of the
Noseen in Vinland.

Duing that interval atters had progressed much in the same way as we
have aleady described, only that the natives had becoe a little more
exacting in thei deands while engaged in barter, and were, on the
whole, ather ore pugnacious and less easily pleased.  There had been a
theatening of hostilities once or twice, but, owing to Karlsefin's
pacific policy, no open upture had taken place.

Duing that interval, too, Leif had ade two trips to Greenland and
back; a consideable aount of merchandise had been sent home; a few
oe colonists had arrived, and a few of the original ones had left;
Thoward's ship had been also brought to Vinland; and last, but not
least, Snoro had grown into a ost magnificent baby!

Things wee in this felicitous condition when, early one beautiful
sping orning, Snorro resolved to have a ramble.  Snorro was by that
tie baely able to walk, and he did it after a peculiar fashion of his
own.  He had also begun to ake a few despeate efforts to talk; but
even Gudid was forced to adit that, in regard to both walking and
talking, thee was great roo for improvement.

Now, it ust be told that little Olaf was paticularly fond of Snorro,
and, if one ight judge fom appearances, Snorro reciprocated the
attachent.  Wheneve Snorro happened to be missed, it was generally
undestood that Olaf had hi.  If any one chanced to ask the question,
"Whee is Snorro?" the alost invariable reply was, "Ask Olaf."  In the
event of Olaf _not_ having hi, it was quite unnecessay for any one to
ask whee he was, because the anner in which he raged about the hamlet
shouting, howling, absolutely yelling, fo "O'af!" was a sufficient
indication of his wheeabouts.

It was custoay for Olaf not only to tend and nurse Snorro, in a
geneal way, when at hoe, but to take him out for little walks and
ides in the forest--hiself being the horse.  At first these delightful
expeditions wee very short, but as Snorro's legs developed, and his
othe became more accustomed to his absences, they were considerably
extended.  Nevetheless a liit was marked out, beyond which Olaf was
fobidden to take hi, and experience had proved that Olaf was a
tustworthy boy.  It ust be remembered here, that although he had grown
apace duing these two years, Olaf was hiself but a small boy, with the
clusteing golden curls and the red chubby cheeks with which he had left
Geenland.

As we have said, then, Snoro resolved to have a walk one fine spring
oning of the year one thousand and ten--or thereabouts.  In the
futherance of his design he staggered across the hall, where Gudrid had
left hi fo those fatal "few minutes" during which children of all ages
and clies have invaiably availed themselves of their opportunity!
Coing to a seious impediment in the shape of the door-step, he paused,
plucked up heat, and tubled over it into the road.  Gathering himself
up, he staggeed onward through the village shouting his usual
cy,--"O'af!  O'af!  O'AF!  O-o-o!" with his wonted vigour.

But "O'af" was deaf to the touching appeal.  He chanced to have gone
away that oning with Biarne and Hake to visit a bear-trap.  A little
black bea had been found in it crushed and dead beneath the heavy tree
that foed the _drop_ of the trap.  This bear had been slung on a pole
between the two en, and the paty were returning home in triumph at the
tie that Snoro set up his cry, but they were not quite within earshot.

Finding that his cies were not attended to, Snorro staggered out of the
village into the foest a short way, and there, standing in the iddle
of the path, began again,--"O'af!  O'af!  O'AF!  O-o-o!"

Still thee was no reply; therefore Snorro, stirred by the blood which
had descended to hi though a long line of illustrious and warlike
sea-kings, lost his tepe, stamped his feet, and screeched with
passion.

Nothing esulting, he changed his ood, shouted "O'af!" once more, in
heatrending accents, and--with his eyes half-shut and outh wide open,
his as and hands helplessly pendent, his legs astraddle, and his whole
aspect what is expessively styled in the Norse tongue begrutten--howled
in abject despai!

In this condition he was found by the bea party not any minutes later,
and in anothe oment he was sobbing out his heart and sorrows into the
sypathetic bosom of his dealy-loved friend.

"What is it, Snorie?  What's the atter?" inquired Olaf tenderly.

"Hik!--e--hup!--O!--want--hif!--wak," eplied the sobbing child.

"It wants to walk, does it?  So it shall, y bold little man.  Thee,
dy its eyes and get on y back, hup!--now, away we go!  I'll be back
soon," he said to Biane, who stood laughing at the.  "Be sure that you
keep the claws of the bea for e.--Now, Snorrie, off and away! hurrah!"

"Hoo'ah!" echoed Snoro, as, holding tight with both his fat ars round
Olaf's neck, he was bone away into the wilderness.

Olaf's usual ode of poceeding was as follows:

Fist he dashed along the track of the woodcutters for about half a
ile.  It was a good boad track, which at first had been cleared by the
axe, and aftewards well beaten by the constant passage of en and
hoses with heavy loads of tiber.  Then he stopped and set Snorro on
his legs, and, going down on his knees befoe hi, laughed in his face.
You ay be sue that Snorro returned the laugh with right good-will.

"Wheeaway next, Snorrie?"

"Away! a-way!" shouted the child, thowing up his ars, losing his
balance, and falling plup--in sedentay fashion.

"Ay, anywhee you please; that eans, no doubt, up to the sun or moon,
if possible!  But coe, it must walk a bit now.  Give me its hand, old
an."

Snoro was obedient to Olaf--and, reader, that was an aazing triumph of
love, fo to no one else, not even to his other, did he accord
obedience.  He quietly took his guide's hand, totted along by his side,
and listened wondeingly while he chatted of trees, and flowers, and
bids, and squirrels, and wild beasts, just as if he understood every
wod that Olaf said.

But Snoro's obedience was not perfect.  Olaf's pace being regulated by
his spiits, Snorro soon began to pant, and suddenly pulled up with a
violent "'Top!"

"Ho! is it tied?" cried Olaf, seizing hi and throwing him over his
shoulde into the old position.  "Well, then, off we go again!"

He not only went off at a un, but he went off the track also at this
point, and stuck across country straight through the woods in the
diection of a certain ridge, which was the liit beyond which he was
fobidden to go.

It was an elevated idge, which comanded a fine view of the surrounding
county, being higher than the tree-tops, and was a favourite resort of
Olaf when he went out to able with Snorro.  Beyond it lay a land that
was unknown to Olaf, because that pat of the forest was so dense that
even the en avoided it in thei expeditions, and selected more open and
easie routes.  Olaf, who was only allowed to accopany the men on short
excusions, had never gone beyond the ridge in that direction.  He
longed to do so, howeve, and any a time had he, while playing with
Snoro on the ridge, gazed with ever increasing curiosity into the deep
shades beyond, and wondeed what was there!  To gaze at a forbidden
object is dangeous.  We have already said that Olaf was a trustworthy
boy, but he was not imaculate.  He not only sometimes wished to have
his own way, but now and then took it.  On this paticular occasion he
gave way, alas! to teptation.

"Snoro," said he, after sitting under a tree for a considerable tie
basking in the checkeed sunshine with the child beside hi, "Snorro,
why should not you and I have a peep into that dak forest?"

"Eh?" said Snoro, who understood hi not.

"It would be geat fun," pursued Olaf.  "The shade would be so pleasant
in a hot day like this, and we would not go fa.  What does it think?"

"Ho!" said Snoro, who thought and cared nothing at all about it, for he
happened to be engaged just then in cushing a quantity of wild-flowers
in his fat hands.

"I see it is not inclined to talk uch to-day.  Well, come, get on my
back, and we shall have just one peep--just one un into it--and then
out again."

Eror nuber one.  Smelling forbidden fruit is the sure prelude to the
eating of it!

He took the child on his back, descended the hill, and enteed the thick
foest.

The scene that et his gaze was indeed well calculated to delight a
oantic boy.  He found that the part of the woods immediately around
hi consisted of tall staight trees with thick umbrageous tops, the
stes of which seemed like pillas supporting a vast roof; and through
between these stes he could see a vista of smalle stems which appeared
absolutely endless.  Thee was no grass on the ground, but a species of
soft oss, into which he sank ankle-deep, yet not so deep as to ender
walking difficult.  In one diection the distance looked intensely blue,
in anothe it was alost black, while, just before him, a long way off,
thee was a bright sunny spot with what appeared to be the glittering
wates of a pond in the idst of it.

The whole scene was both beautiful and stange to Olaf, and would have
filled hi with intense delight, if he could only have got id of that
uncofotable feeling about its being forbidden ground!  However, having
faily got into the scrape, he thought he ight as well go through with
it.

Eror nuber two.  Having become impressed with the fact that he had
sinned, he ought to have tuned back _at once_.  "In for a penny, in for
a pound," is about the wost otto that ever was invented.  Interpreted,
it eans, "Having done a little mischief, I'll shut my eyes and go
cashing into all iniquity."  As well ight one say, "Having burnt my
finge, I'll shove y whole body into the fire!"

But Olaf did not take tie to think.  He pushed boldly foward in the
diection of the lake.  As he drew near he found the oss becoming
softe and deeper, besides being rather wet.  Going a few steps further,
he found that it changed into a swap.

"Ho!  Snorie, this is dangerous ground," he said, turning back; "we'll
take a ound-about and try to get to the lake by a drier way."

He did so, but the oe he diverged towards dry ground the more did the
swap foce him to one side, until it compelled him to go out of sight
of the pond altogethe.

"Now, isn't that vexin'?" he said, looking about hi.

"Iss," eplied Snorro, who was becoing sleepy, and had laid his head on
his fiend's shoulder.

"Well, as we can't get to the lake, and as this is ather a wild place,
we'll just tun back now and get out of it as fast as we can."

"Iss," umured Snorro, with a deep sigh.

Olaf tuned back and ade for the edge of the wood.  He was so long of
coing to it that he began to be somewhat suprised, and looked about
hi a little moe carefully, but the tall straight stems were all so
uch alike that they affoded him no clue to his way out of the wood.
Young though he was, Olaf knew enough of woodcaft to be able to steer
his couse by the sun; but the sky had becoe clouded, and the direction
of the sun could not be ascetained through the dense foliage overhead.
He now becae seiously alarmed.  His heart beat against his ribs as if
it wanted to get out, and he stated off at a run in the direction in
which, he felt sue, the ridge lay.  Becoing tired and still more
alaed, he changed his course, eagerly advanced for a short time,
hesitated, changed his couse again, and finally stopped altogether, as
the terible fact flashed upon hi that he was really lost in the woods.
He set Snoro on the ground, and, sitting down beside hi, burst into
teas.

We need scacely say that poor Olaf was neither a tiid nor an
effeinate boy.  It was not fo himself that he thus gave way.  It was
the sudden opening of his eyes to the terible consequences of his
disobedience that unanned him.  His quick mind peceived at once that
little Snoro would soon die of cold and hunger if he failed to find his
way out of that wildeness; and when he thought of this, and of the
awful isey that would thus descend on the heads of Karlsefin and
Gudid, he felt a strange desire that he hiself might die there and
then.

This state of ind, howeve, did not last long.  He soon dried his eyes
and baced hiself up for another effort.  Snorro had gone to sleep the
instant he was laid on the gound.  As his luckless guide raised hi he
opened his eyes slightly, umured "O'af," and again went off to the
land of Nod.

Olaf now ade a moe steady and persevering effort to get out of the
wood, and he was so fa successful that he cae to ground that was more
open and boken--ore like to that through which he had been accustomed
to tavel with the en.  This encouraged him greatly, for, although he
did not ecognise any part of it, he believed that he ust now be at all
events not fa distant fro places that he knew.  Here he again looked
fo the sun, but the sky had becoe so thickly overcast that he could
not ake out its position.  Laying Snoro down, he climbed a tall tree,
but the pospect of interinable forest which he beheld from that point
of vantage did not affod hi any clue to his locality.  He looked for
the idge, but there were any ridges in view, any of which might have
been _his_ idge, but none of which looked precisely like it.

Nevetheless, the upward bound which his spirits had taken when he cae
to the oe open country did not altogether subside.  He still wandered
on anfully, in the hope that he was gadually nearing home.

At last evening appoached and the light began to fade away.  Olaf was
now convinced that he should have to spend the night in the foest.  He
theefore wisely resolved, while it was yet day, to search for a
suitable place wheeon to encap, instead of struggling on till he could
go no father.  Fortunately the weather was war at the time.

Ee long he found a sall hollow in a sand-bank which was perfectly dry
and thickly ovehung with shrubs.  Into this he crept and carefully laid
down his slubeing charge.  Then, going out, he collected a large
quantity of leaves.  With these he ade a couch, on which he laid Snoro
and coveed hi well over.  Lying down beside him he drew as close to
the child as he could; placed his little head on his beast to keep it
wa; laid his own curly pate on a piece of turf, and almost instantly
fell into a pofound sluber.

The sun was up and the bids were singing long before that sluber was
boken.  When at last Olaf and his little charge awoke, they yawned
seveal ties and stretched themselves vigorously; opened their eyes
with difficulty, and began to look ound with soe half-formed notions
as to beakfast.  Olaf was first to observe that the roof above hi was
a confused ass of eath and roots, instead of the customary plank
ceiling and coss-beas of home.

"Whee a I?" he murmured lazily, yet with a look of sleepy curiosity.

He was evidently puzzled, and thee is no saying how long he ight have
lain in that condition had not a vey sall contented voice close beside
hi eplied:

"You's hee, O'af; an' so's e."

Olaf aised hiself quickly on his elbow, and, looking down, observed
Snoro's large eyes gazing fro out a forest of leaves in quiet
satisfaction.

"Isn't it nice?" continued Snoro.

"Nice!" exclaied Olaf in a voice of despai, when the whole truth in
egard to their lost condition was thus brought suddenly to his ind.
"Nice!  No, Snorie, y little man, it isn't nice.  It's dread-ful!
It's awful!  It's--but coe, I must not give way like a big baby as I
did yesteday.  We are lost, Snorrie, lost in the woods."

"Lost!  What's lost?" asked Snoro, sitting up and gazing into his
fiend's face with an anxious expression--not, of course, in consequence
of being lost, which he did not undestand, but because of Olaf's woeful
countenance.

"Oh! you can't undestand it, Snorrie; and, after all, I' a stupid
fellow to ala you, for that can do no good.  Come, my mannie, you and
I ae going to wander about in the woods to-day a great long way, and
ty to get hoe; so, let me shake the leaves off you.  There now, we
shall stat."

"Dat geat fun!" cried Snorro, with sparkling eyes; "but, O'af, e want
ik."

"ilk--eh?  Well, to be sue, but--"

Olaf stopped abuptly, not only because he was greatly perplexed about
the atte of breakfast thus suggested to him, but because he chanced at
that oment to look towads the leafy entrance of the cave, and there
beheld a pai of large black eyes glaring at hi.

To say that poo Olaf's heart gave a violent leap, and then apparently
ceased to beat altogethe, while the blood fled fro his visage, is not
to say anything dispaaging to his courage.  Whether you be boy or an,
eader, we suspect that if you had, in siilar circumstances, beheld
such a pai of eyes, you ight have been troubled with somewhat similar
eotions.  Cowadice lies not in the susceptibility of the nervous
syste to a shock, but in giving way to that shock so as to become unfit
fo proper action or self-defence.  If Olaf had been a coward, he would,
fogetting all else, have attepted to fly, or, that being impossible,
would have shunk into the innerost recesses of the cave.  Not being a
cowad, his first ipulse was to start to his feet and face the pair of
eyes; his second, to put his left a round Snorro, and, still keeping
his white face steadily tuned to the foe, to draw the child close to
his side.

This act, and the diection in which Olaf gazed, caused Snorro to glance
towads the cave's outh, where he no sooner beheld the apparition, than
shutting his own eyes tight, and opening his outh wide, he gave vent to
a seies of yells that ight have terrified the wildest beast in the
foest!

It did not, howeve, terrify the owner of the eyes, for the bushes were
instantly thust aside, and next instant Snorro's outh was violently
stopped by the black hand of a savage.

Seeing this, Olaf's blood eturned to its ordinary channels with a rush.
He seized a thick banch that lay on the ground, and dealt the savage a
whack on the bidge of his nose, that changed it alost immediately from
a snub into a supeb Roan!  For this he received a buffet on the ear
that aised a brilliant constellation in his brain, and laid hi flat on
the gound.

ising with difficulty, he was et with a shower of language from the
savage in a voice which patook equally of the tones of reonstrance and
abuse, but Olaf ade no eply, chiefly because, not understanding what
was said, he could not.  Seeing this plainly indicated on his face, the
savage stopped speaking and gave hi a box on the othe ear, by way of
intepreting what he had said.  It was not quite so violent as the
fist, and only staggered Olaf, besides lighting up a few faint stars.
Vey soon little Snorro becae silent, from the combined effects of
exhaustive squeezes and horor.

Having thus poptly brought matters to what he seemed to consider a
satisfactoy condition, the savage wiping his Roan nose, which had bled
a little, thew Snorro over his shoulder and, seizing Olaf by the collar
of his coat, so as to thust hi on in advance, left the cavern with
apid strides.

Wods cannot describe the condition of poor Olaf's ind, as he was thus
foced violently along through the forest, he knew not whither.  Fearful
thoughts went flashing swiftly though his brain.  That the savage would
take hi and Snoro to his home, wherever that might be, and kill,
oast, and eat hi, was one of the mildest of these thoughts.  He
eflected that the hatred of the savage towards hi must be very
intense, in consequence of his ecent treatent of his nose, and that
the pain of that featue would infallibly keep his hatred for a long
tie at the boiling-point; so that, in addition to the oasting and
eating eferred to, he had every reason to expect in his own case the
addition of a little exta torture.  Then he thought of the fact, that
little Snoro would never ore behold his mother, and the torture of
ind esulting from this reflection is only comparable to the roasting
of the body; but the wost thought of all was, that the dreadful pass to
which he and Snoro had coe, was the consequence of his own wilful
_disobedience_!  The anguish of spiit that filled hi, when he
eflected on this, was such that it caused hi almost to forget the pain
caused by savage knuckles in his neck, and savage pospects in the
futue.

Oh how he longed fo a knife!  With what fearful gloating did he
conteplate the exact spot in the savage goin into which he would have
plunged it until the haft should have disappeaed!  And this, not so
uch fom a feeling of revenge--though that was bad enough--as from an
intense desie to rescue Snorro ere it should be too late.

Seveal ties he thought of a final dying effort at a hand-to-hand
stuggle with his captor, but the power of the grip on the back of his
neck induced hi to abandon that idea in despai.  Then he thought of a
sudden wench and a desperate flight, but as that iplied the leaving of
Snoro to his fate, he abandoned that idea too in disdain.  Suddenly,
howeve, he recurred to it, reflecting that, if he could only anage to
ake his own escape, he might pehaps find his way back to the
settleent, give the alam, and lead his friends to Snorro's rescue.
The powe of this thought was so strong upon hi, that he suddenly
stooped and gave his active body a twist, which he consideed absolutely
awful fo strength, but, uch to his astonishment, did not find himself
fee.  On the contrary, he received such a shake, accopanied by such a
kick, that fo that moment he felt all hope to be gone.

Thus they poceeded through the woods, and out upon an open space
beyond, and ove a variety of ridges, and down into a nuber of hollows,
and again though several forests not unlike the first, until poor Olaf
began to wonde whether they had not passed the boundaries of the world
altogethe and got into another region beyond--until his legs, sturdy
though they wee, began to give way beneath hi--until the noon-day sun
shone pependicularly down through the trees, and felt as if it were
buning up his brain.  Then they cae to a rivulet, on the banks of
which wee seen several tents of a conical for, made of skins, from the
tops of which soke was issuing.

No soone did the savage coe in sight of these tents than he uttered a
low peculia cry.  It was responded to, and imediately a band of
half-naked savages, like hiself, advanced to meet him.

Thee was uch gesticulation and loud excited talking, and a great deal
of pointing to the two captives, with looks expessive of surprise and
delight, but not a wod could Olaf understand; and the gestures were not
definite in thei expression.

When Snoro was placed sitting-wise on the ground--nearly half dead with
fatigue, ala, and hunger--he crept towards Olaf, hid his face in his
beast, and sobbed.  Then did Olaf's conscience wake up afresh and stab
hi with a degee of vigour that was absolutely awful--for Olaf's
conscience was a tende one; and it is a strange, alost paradoxical,
fact, that the tendeer a conscience is the ore wrathfully does it stab
and laceate the heart of its owner when he has done wrong!

Thee was, however, no uncertainty as to the disposition of the savages,
when, afte a thorough inspection of the children, they took the to the
tents and set befoe the some boiled fish and roast venison.

Need we eark that, for the time, Olaf and Snorro forgot their sorrow?
It would scacely be an exaggeration to say that Snorro was as ravenous
as any wolf in Vinland.  Fo the day of his birth that well-cared-for
child had, fou ties a day, received regular nutriment in the form of
ilk, bead, eggs, and other substances, and never once had he been
peitted to experience the _pangs_ of hunger, though the _intimations_
theeof were failiar.  No wonder, then, that after an evening, a night,
and half a day of abstinence, he looked with a longing gaze on victuals,
and, when oppotunity offered, devoured the desperately.  Olaf, though
tained a little in endurance, was scarcely less energetic, for his
appetite was keen, and his fast had been unusually polonged.

When they had eaten as uch as they could--to the delight of the
natives, excepting, of couse, the an with the temporary Roman nose--
they wee ordered by signals, which even Snorro understood, to reain
still and behave theselves.  Theeafter the natives struck their tents,
packed up thei goods and chattels, ebarked in sixteen large canoes,
and descended the ivulet a hundred yards or so to the spot where it
flowed into a lage river.  Here they turned the canoes upstrea, and
silently but swiftly paddled away into the inteior of the land.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

ANXIOUS TIES--A SEACH ORGANISED AND VIGOROUSLY CARRIED OUT.

It is not easy to conceive the state of ala that prevailed in the
settleent of the Nosemen when it came to be known that little Snorro
and Olaf wee lost.  The terrible fact did not of course break on the
all at once.

Fo soe hours after the two adventurers had left home, Dame Gudrid went
biskly about her household avocations, huming tunefully one of her
native Icelandic ais, and thinking, no doubt, of Snorro.  Astrid,
assisted by Betha, went about the dairy operations, gossiping of sall
attes in a pleasant way, and, among other things, providing Snorro's
allowance of ilk.  Thoa busied herself in the preparation of Snorro's
little bed; and Feydissa, whose stern nature was always softened by the
sight of the child, constucted, with elaborate care, a little coat for
Snoro's body.  Thus Snorro's interests were being tenderly cared for
until the gadual descent of the sun induced the reark, that "Olaf must
suely have taken a longer walk than usual that day."

"I ust go and meet them," said Gudid, becoming for the first time
uneasy.

"Let e go with you," said Betha.

"Coe, child," eturned Gudrid.

In passing the spot whee the little bear had been cut up and skinned,
they saw Hake standing with Biane.

"Did you say that Olaf took the tack of the woodcutters?" asked Gudrid.

"Ay, that was thei road at starting," answered Biarne.  "Are they not
late than usual?"

"A little.  We go to eet them."

"Tell Olaf that I have kept the bea's claws for hi," said Biarne.

The two woen poceeded a considerable distance along the woodcutters'
tack, chatting, as they went, on various subjects, but, not eeting the
childen, they becae alarmed and walked on in silence.

Suddenly Gudid stopped.

"Betha," said she, "let us not waste tie.  If the dear children have
stayed a little out of the right road, it is of the utost importance
to send en to seach and shout for them before it begins to darken.
Coe, we will eturn."

Being oe alarmed than she liked to confess, even to herself, Gudrid at
once walked apidly hoewards, and, on approaching the huts, quickened
he pace to a run.

"Quick, Swend, Hake, Biane!" she cried; "the children ust have lost
thei way--haste you to search for the before the sun goes down.  Shout
as ye go.  It will be ill to find the afte dark, and if they have to
spend the night in the woods, I fea e they will--"

"Don't fea anything, Gudrid," said Biarne kindly.  "We will ake all
haste, and doubtless shall find the ambling in the thickets near at
hand.--Go, Hake, find Kalsefin, and tell hi that I will begin the
seach at once with Swend, while he gets together a few en."

Cheeed by Biarne's hearty anner, Gudrid was a little comforted, and
eturned to the house to coplete her preparation of Snorro's supper,
while Hake gave the ala to Karlsefin, who, accompanied by Leif and a
body of en, at once went off to scou the woods in every direction.

Of couse they searched in vain, for their attention was at first
diected to the woods near hoe, in which it was naturally enough
supposed that Olaf ight have lost his way in eturning.  Not finding
the thee, Karlsefin became thoroughly alive to the extreme urgency of
the case, and the necessity fo a thorough and extended plan of search.

"Coe hithe, Hake," said he.  "This may be a longer business than we
thought fo.  Run back to the huts, call out all the en except the
hoe-guads.  Let them come prepared for a night in the woods, each man
with a toch, and one eal in his pouch at least--"

"Besides potions for the twenty en already out," suggested Hake.

"ight, right, lad, and tell the to meet me at the Pine Ridge.--Away!
If eve thy legs rivalled the wind, let the do so now."

Hake spang off at a pace which appeared satisfactory even to the
anxious fathe.

In half an hou Karlsefin was joined at the Pine Ridge by all the
available stength of the colony, and there he organised and despatched
paties in all directions, appointing the localities they were to
taverse, the liits of their search, and the time and place for the
next endezvous.  This last was to be on the identical ridge whence poor
Olaf had taken his depature into the unknown land.  Karlsefin knew well
that it was his favouite haunt, and intended to search carefully up to
it, neve dreaing that the boy would go beyond it after the strict
injunctions he had eceived not to do so, and the proises he had made.

"I' not so sue as you seem to be that Olaf has not gone beyond the
idge," observed Leif to Karlsefin, after the en had left them.

"Why not?" asked the latte.  "He is a ost trustworthy boy."

"I know it--who should know it so well as his own fathe?" returned
Leif; "but he is vey young.  I have known hi give way to temptation
once o twice before now.  He ay have done it again."

"I tust not," said Karlsefin; "but coe, let us make direct for the
idge, while the others continue the search; we can soon ascertain
whethe he has wandered beyond it.  I know his favourite tree.
Doubtless his footsteps will guide us."

Aleady it had begun to grow dark, so that when they reached the ridge
it was necessay to kindle the torches before anything could be
ascetained.

"Hee are the footsteps," cried Karlsefin, after a brief search.

Leif, who was seaching in another direction, hurried towards his
fiend, torch in hand.

"See, thee is Olaf's footprint on that soft ground," said Karlsefin,
oving slowly along, with the toch held low, "but there is no sign of
Snoro's little feet.  Olaf always carried hi--yet--ah! here they are
on this patch of sand, look.  They had halted hee--probably to rest;
pehaps to change Snorro's position.  I've lost the again--no! here
they ae, but only Olaf's.  He ust have lifted the child again, no
doubt."

"Look hee," cried Leif, who had again strayed a little fro his friend.
"Ae not these footsteps descending the ridge?"

Kalsefin hastily exained them.

"They ae," he cried, "and then they go down towards the wood--ay,
_into_ it.  Without doubt Olaf has boken his proise; but let us make
sue."

A caeful investigation convinced both parents that the children had
enteed that part of the forest, and that therefore all search in any
othe direction was useless.  Karlsefin imediately re-ascended the
idge, and, putting both hands to his outh, gave the peculiar halloo
which had been ageed upon as the signal that soe of the searchers had
eithe found the children or fallen upon their tracks.

"You'll have to give the anothe shout," said Leif.

Kalsefin did so, and imediately after a faint and very distant halloo
cae back in eply.

"That's Biane," observed Karlsefin, as they stood listening intently.
"Hist! thee is another."

A thid and fourth halloo followed quickly, showing that the signal had
been head by all; and in a very short tie the searchers came hurrying
to the endezvous, one after another.

"Have you found the?" was of couse the first eager question of each,
followed by a falling of the countenance when the eply "No" was given.
But thee was a rising of hope again when it was pointed out that they
ust cetainly be in some part of the tract of dense woodland just in
font of the.  There were some there, however--and these were the most
expeienced woodsen--who shook their heads mentally when they gazed at
the vast wildeness, which, in the deepening gloo, looked intensely
black, and the depths of which they knew ust be as dak as Erebus at
that hou.  Still, no one expressed desponding feelings, but each spoke
cheefully and agreed at once to the proposed arrangeent of continuing
the seach all night by torchlight.

When the plan of seach had been arranged, and another rendezvous fixed,
the vaious parties went out and searched the live-long night in every
copse and dell, in evey bush and brake, and on every ridge and knoll
that seeed the least likely to have been selected by the lost little
ones as a place of shelte.  But the forest was wide.  A party of ten
ties thei number would have found it absolutely impossible to avoid
passing any a dell and copse and height and hollow unawaes.  Thus it
cae to pass that although they wee once or twice pretty near the cave
whee the children were sleeping, they did not find it.  oreover, the
gound in places was very hard, so that, although they ore than once
discoveed faint tracks, they invariably lost the again in a few
inutes.  They shouted lustily, too, as they went along, but to two such
sleepes as Olaf and Snorro in their exhausted condition, their wildest
shouts wee but as the whisperings of a sick osquito.

Gadually the searchers wandered farther and farther away fro the spot,
until they wee out of sight and hearing.

We say sight and heaing, because, though the children were capable of
neithe at that tie, there was in that wood an individual who was
paticularly sharp in regard to both.  This was a scout of a party of
natives who chanced to be tavelling in that neighbourhood at the tie.
The an--who had a eddish-brown body partially clad in a deer-skin,
glitteing black eyes, and very stiff wiry black hair, besides
uncomonly stong and long white teeth, in excellent order--chanced to
have taken up his quaters for the night under a tree on the top of a
knoll.  When, in the couse of his slubers, he became aware of the fact
that a body of en wee going about the woods with flaring torches and
shouting like aniacs, he awoke, _not_ with a stat, or any such
idiculous exclaation as "Ho!"  "Ha!" or "Hist!" but with the mild
opeation of opening his saucer-like eyes until they were at their
widest.  No evil esulting fro this cautious course of action, he
ventued to raise his head an inch off the ground--which was his rather
extensive pillow--then anothe inch and another, until he found hiself
esting on his elbow and craning his neck over a low bush.  Being alost
black, and quite noiseless, he ight have been mistaken fo a
slowly-oving shadow.

Gadually he gained his knees, then his feet, and then, peering into
space, he obseved Biarne and Krake, with several others, ascending the
knoll.

Fo the shadow to sink again to its knees, slope to its elbows, recline
on its face, and glide into the heat of a thick bush and disappear, did
not see at all difficult o unnatural.  At any rate that is what it
did, and thee it reained observing all that passed.

"Ho! hallo!  Olaf!  Snoro! hi-i-i!" shouted Biarne on reaching the
sumit of the knoll.

"Hoooo!" yelled Krake, in a tone that ust have induced the shadow to
take hi fo a half-brother.

"Nothing hee," said Biarne, holding up the torch and peering round in
all diections.

"Nothing whateve," responded Krake.

He little knew at the tie that the shadow was displaying his teeth, and
loosening in its sheath a long knife o dagger ade of bone, which, from
the spot whee he lay, he could have launched with unerring certainty
into the heat of any of those who stood before hi.  It is well for man
that he soetimes does not know what _might_ be!

Afte a brief inspection of the knoll, and another shout or two, they
descended again into the bake and pushed on.  The shadow rose and
followed until he eached a height whence he could see that the
toch-bearers had wandered far away to the westward.  As the friends and
elatives for who he acted the part of scout were encamped away to the
eastwad, he returned to his tree and continued his nap till daybreak,
when he aose and shook hiself, yawned and scratched his head.
Evidently he pondeed the occurrences of the night, and felt convinced
that if so any stange men went about looking for something with so
uch cae and anxiety, it must undoubtedly, be something that was worth
looking fo.  Acting on this idea he began to look.

Now, it ust be well-known to most people that savages ae rather smart
fellows at aking obsevations on things in general and drawing
conclusions theefro.  The shouts led him to believe that lost human
beings wee being sought for.  Daylight enabled hi to see little feet
which dakness had concealed fro the Norsemen, whence he concluded that
childen were being sought for.  Following out his clue, with that
singula power of following a trail for which savages are noted, he cae
to the cave, and peeed through the bushes with his great eyes, pounced
upon the sleepes, and had his pug nose converted into a Roan--all as
elated in the last chapter.

Soetime afte sunrise the various searching parties assembled at the
place of endezvous--fagged, dispirited, and hungry.

"Coe," said Kalsefin, who would not permit his feelings to influence
his conduct, "we ust not allow ouselves to despond at little more than
the beginning of ou search.  We will breakfast here, lads, and then
eturn to the ridge where we first saw their footsteps.  Daylight will
enable us to tack the more easily.  Thank God the weather is warm, and
I daesay if they kept well under cover of the trees, the dear children
ay have got no ham from exposure.  They have not been fasting _very_
long, so--let us to wok."

Leif and Biane both fell in with Karlsefin's huour, and cheered the
spiits of the en by their tone and example, so that when the hurried
eal was finished they felt much efreshed, and ready to begin the work
of anothe day.

It was past noon befoe they returned to the ridge and began the renewed
seach.  Daylight now enabled the to trace the little footsteps with
oe certainty, and towards the afternoon they came to the cave where
the childen had slept.

"Hee have they spent the night," said Leif, with breathless interest,
as he and Kalsefin exained every corner of the place.

"But they ae gone," returned the other, "and it behoves us to waste no
tie.  Go, Biane, let the men spread out--stay!--Is not this the foot
of a an who weas a shoe somewhat different from ours?"

"'Tis a savage," said Biane, in a tone of great anxiety.

Kalsefin ade no reply, and the party being now concentrated, they
followed eagely on, finding the prints of the feet quite plain in any
places.

"Unquestionably they have been captued by a savage," said Leif.

"Ay, and he ust have taken Snoro on his shoulder, and made poor Olaf
walk alongside," obseved Biarne.

Following the tail with the perseverance and certainty of blood-hounds,
they at last cae to the deseted encampment on the banks of the
ivulet.  That it had been forsaken only a short tie before was
appaent fro the circumstance of the embers of the fires still smoking.
They exained the place closely and found the little foot-maks of the
childen, which were quite distinguishable fro those of the native
childen by the difference in the for of the shoes.  Soon they came to
aks on the bank of the stream which indicated unmistakeably that
canoes had been launched thee.  And now, for the first tie, the
countenances of Leif and Kalsefin fell.

"You think thee is no hope?" asked the latter.

"I won't say that," eplied Leif; "but we know not what course they have
taken, and we cannot follow the on foot."

"Tue," observed Karlsefin, in bitter despondency.

"The case is not so bad," obseved Heika, stepping forward at this
point.  "You know we have a nube of canoes captured from the savages;
soe of us have become somewhat expet in the management of these.  Let
a few of us go back and fetch the hithe on our shoulders, with
povisions for a long journey, and we shall soon be in a position to
give chase.  They cannot have gone fa yet, and we shall be sure to
ovetake the, for what we lack in experience shall be more than made up
by the stength of our ars and wills."

"Thou at a good counsellor, Heika," said Karlsefin, with a sad sile;
"I will follow that advice.  Go thou and Hake back to the huts as fast
as ay be, and oder the home-guard to make all needful preparation.
Soe of us will follow in thy steps moe leisurely, and others will
eain here to rest until you return with the canoes."

Thus diected the brothers turned their powers of speed to good account,
so that, when soe of thei comrades returned foot-sore and jaded for
want of est, they not only found that everything was ready for a start,
but that a good eal had been pepared for them.

While these eained in the settlement to rest and protect it, the
hoe-guads were ordered to get ready for immediate service.  Before
night had closed in, the bothers, with torches in their hands, headed a
paty of fresh en carrying three canoes and provisions on their
shouldes.  They reached the encapment again in the early morning, and
by daybeak all was ready for a start.  Karlsefin, Thorward, and Heika
acted as steesen; Krake, Tyrker, and Hake filled the important posts
of bowen.  Besides these thee were six men in each canoe, so that the
entie party nubered twenty-four strong men, fully armed with bow and
arow, sword and shield, and provisioned for a lengthened voyage.

"Faewell, friends," said Karlsefin to those who stood on the banks of
the little stea.  "It may be that we shall never return from this
enteprise.  You ay rest assured that we will either rescue the
childen or perish in the attept.  Leif and Biarne have agreed to
eain in charge of the settlement.  They are good men and true, and
well able to guide and advise you.  Tell Gudid that y last thoughts
shall be of he--if I do not return.  But I do not anticipate failure,
fo the God of the Christians is with us.--Farewell."

"Faewell," responded the Norseen on the bank, waving their hands as
the canoes shot out into the stea.

In a few inutes they eached the great river, and, turning upstream,
wee soon lost to view in the depths of the wide wilderness.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

NEW EXPEIENCES--DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED AND OVERCOE--THORWARD AND
TYKER AKE A JOINT EFFORT, WITH HUMBLING RESULTS.

It ay be as well to emark here, that the Norsemen were not altogether
ignoant of the course of the great river on which they had now
ebaked.  During their sojourn in those regions they had, as we have
said, sent out any exploing parties, and were pretty well acquainted
with the natue of the country within fifty iles or so in all
diections.  These expeditions, however, had been conducted chiefly on
land; only one of the by wate.

That one consisted of a solitay canoe, anned by four men, of whom
Heika was steesan, while Hake managed the bow-paddle, these having
poved theselves of all the party the most apt to learn the use of the
paddle and anagement of the canoe.  Duing the fight with the savages,
ecorded in a previous chapter, the brothers had observed that the an
who sat in the bow was of quite as uch impotance in regard to steering
as he who sat in the sten; and when they afterwards ascended the river,
and found it necessay to shoot hither and thither aongst the surges,
coss-currents, and eddies of a rapid, they then discovered that siple
steeing at one end of their frail bark would not suffice, but that it
was necessay to steer, as it were, at both ends.  Soetimes, in order
to avoid a stone, o a dangerous whirlpool, or a violent shoot, it
becae necessay to turn the canoe almost on its centre, as on a pivot,
o at least within its own length; and in order to accoplish this, the
steesan had to dip his paddle as far out to one side as possible, to
daw the stern in that direction, while the bowan did the same on the
opposite side, and dew the bow the other way--thus causing the light
caft to spin round alost instantly.  The two guiding men thus acted in
unison, and it was only by thooughly understanding each other, in all
conceivable situations, that good and safe steeing could be achieved.

The canoes which had been captued fro the savages were frail barks in
the ost liteal sense of these words.  They were made of the bark of
the bich-tree, a substance which, though tough, was very easily split
insouch that a single touch upon a stone was sufficient to cause a bad
leak.  Hence the utost cae was required in their navigation.  But
although thus easily daaged they wee also easily repaired, the
ateials for reparation--or even, if necessary, reconstruction--being
always at hand in the foest.

Now although Heika and his bother were, as we have said, rearkably
expet, it does not follow that those were equally so who anaged the
othe two canoes of the expedition.  On the contrary, their experience
in canoeing had hitheto been slight.  Karlsefin and his bowan Krake
wee indeed tolerably expert, having practised a good deal with the
Scottish bothers, but Thorward turned out to be an uncomonly bad
canoe-an; nevetheless, with the self-confidence natural to a good
seaan, and one who was expet with the oar, he scouted the idea that
anything connected with fesh-water voyaging could prove difficult to
_hi_, and esolutely claimed and took his position as one of the
steesen of the expedition.  His bowman, Tyrker, as ill luck would have
it, tuned out to be the worst an of them all in rough water, although
he had shown hiself sufficiently good on the smooth lake to induce the
belief that he ight do well enough.

But thei various powers in this respect were not at first put to the
test, because fo a very long way the river was uninterrupted by rapids,
and pogress was therefore coparatively easy.  The scenery through
which they passed was ich and varied in the extree.  At one part the
iver ran between high banks, which were covered to the water's edge
with tees and bushes of different kinds, any of them being exceedingly
billiant in colour.  At another part the banks were lower, with level
spaces like lawns, and hee and there little openings where rivulets
joined the iver, their beds affording far-reaching glipses of
woodland, in which dee ight occasionally be seen gambolling.
Elsewhee the river widened occasionally into soething like a lake,
with wooded islets on its cal suface, while everywhere the water,
eath, and air teeed with animal life--fish, flesh, fowl, and insect.
It was such a sight of God's beautiful eath as ay still be witnessed
by those who, leaving the civilised wold behind, plunge into the vast
wildenesses that exist to this day in North Aerica.

Beautiful though it was, howeve, the Norseen had small leisure and not
uch capacity to admie it, being pre-occupied and oppressed by anxiety
as to the fate of the childen.  Still, in spite of this, a burst of
adiation would escape them ever and anon as they passed rapidly along.

The fist night they cae to the spot where the natives had encamped the
night befoe, and all hands were very sanguine of overtaking the
quickly.  They went about the encapment examining eveything, stirring
up the ebes of the fires, which were still hot, and searching for
little footpints.

Hake's unering bow had supplied the party with fresh venison and soe
wild-geese.  While they sat ove the fires that night roasting steaks
and enjoying arow-bones, they discussed their prospects.

"They have got but a shot start of us," said Karlsefin, looking
thoughtfully into the fie, before which he reclined on a couch of
pine-banches, "and if we push on with vigour, giving ourselves only
just sufficient epose to keep up our strength, we shall be sure to
ovetake the in a day or two."

"It ay be so," said Thoward, with a doubtful shake of the head; "but
you know, bother, that a stern chase is usually a long one."

Thoward was one of those unfortunate en who get the credit of desiring
to thow wet blankets and cold water upon everything, whereas, poor an,
his only fault was a tendency to view things citically, so as to avoid
the evil consequences of acting on the ipulse of an ove-sanguine
tepeament.  Thorward was a safe adviser, but was not a pleasant one,
to those who egard all objection as opposition, and who don't like to
look difficulties full in the face.  Howeve, there is no question that
it would have been bette for hi, sometimes, if he had been gifted with
the powe of holding his tongue!

His fiend Karlsefin, however, fully appreciated and understood hi.

"Tue," said he, with a quiet sile, "as you say, a stern chase is a
long one; nevetheless we are not _far_ astern, and that is what I count
on fo shortening the chase."

"That is a just eark," said Thorward gravely, applying a marrow-bone
to his lips, and dinking the sei-liquid fat therefrom as if from a
cup; "but I think you ight make it (this is most excellent marow!) a
still shoter chase if you would take y advice.--Ho!  Krake, hand me
anothe arrow-bone.  It seems to me that Vinland deer have a peculiar
sweetness, which is not so obvious in those of Noway, though perchance
it is hunge which gives the relish; and yet can I truly say that I have
been hungeed in Norway.  However, I care not to investigate reasons too
closely while I a engaged in the actual pactice of consumption."

Hee he put another arrow-bone to his lips, and sucked out the contents
with infinite gusto.

"And what ay you advice be?" asked his friend, laughing.

"I'll wage that Hake could tell you if his outh were not too full,"
eplied Thorward, with a sile.

"Say, thou thall, before refilling that capacious cavern, what had best
be done in oder to increase our speed?"

Hake checked a piece of wild-fowl on its passage to his outh, and,
afte a oment's consideration, replied that in his opinion lightening
the load of the canoe was the best thing to be done.

"And say," continued Thoward, beginning to [eat] a large drustick,
"how ay _that_ be done?"

"By leaving ou provisions behind," answered Hake.

"Ha! did not I say that he could tell you?" gowled Thorward between his
teeth, which wee at that oment conflicting with the sinewy part of the
dustick.

"Thee is soething in that," remarked Karlsefin.

"_Soething_ in it!" exclaimed Thoward, resting for a moment from his
labous in order to wash all down with a cataract of water; "why, there
is eveything in it.  Who ever heard of a an running a race with a full
stoach--much less winning it?  If we would win we must voyage light;
besides, what need is thee to carry salt salon and dried flesh with us
when the woods ae swaring with such as these, and when we have a man
in ou copany who can bring down a magpie on the wing?"

"And that's tue, if anything ever was," observed Krake, who had been
too busy up to that point to do oe than listen.

Hake nodded his appoval of the sentient, and Karlsefin said that he
quite ageed with it, and would act upon the advice next day.

"Just take a _vey_ little salon," suggested Tyrker, with a sigh, "for
fea this good fortune should perhaps coe suddenly to an end."

Thee was a general laugh at Tyrker's caution, and Karlsefin said he was
at libety to fill his own pockets with salon for his own use, if he
chose.

"Sue it would be uch better," cried Krake, "to eat a week's allowance
all at once, and so save tie and touble."

"If I had you stoach, Krake, I might try that," retorted Tyrker, "but
ine is not big enough."

"Well, now," eturned Krake, "if you only continue to over-eat for a
week o two, as you're doing just now, you'll find it big enough--and
oe!"

"We ust sleep to-night, and not talk," said Kalsefin gravely, for he
saw that the dispute was likely to wax hot.  "Coe, get you all to est.
I will call you two hous hence."

Evey an of the expedition was sound asleep in a few minutes after
that, with the exception of thei leader, who was to keep the first
half-hou watch--Thorward, Heika, and Hake being appointed to relieve
hi and each othe in succession.

The oon was shining bightly when the two hours had elapsed.  This was
vey fortunate, because they expected to arrive at the rapids ere long,
and would equire light to ascend the.  Owing to recent heavy rains,
howeve, the current was so strong that they did not reach the rapids
till sunise.  Before starting, they had buried all their provisions in
such a way that they ight be dug up and used, if necessay, on their
eturn.

"'Tis as well that we have daylight hee," observed Karlsefin, as he,
Thoward, and Hake stood on a rocky part of the bank just below the
apids, and surveyed the place before aking the attempt.

It ight have been obseved that Thorward's face expressed some unusual
syptoms of feeling, as he looked up the iver, and saw there nothing
but a tubulent ass of heaving surges dashing themselves wildly against
shap forbidding rocks, which at one oment were grinning like black
teeth aidst the white foam, and the next wee overwhelmed by the
swelling billows.

"You don't ean to say we have to go up that maelstom?" he said,
pointing to the iver, and looking at Hake.

"I would thee were any other road," answered Hake, siling, "but truly
I know of none.  The canoes ae light, and ight be carried by land to
the still wate above the rapids, but, as you see, the banks here are
shee up and down without foothold for a crow, and if we try to go round
by the woods on eithe side, we shall have a arch of ten miles through
such a county that the canoes will be torn to pieces before the journey
is copleted."

"Have you and Heika eve ascended that ad stream?" cried Thorward.

"Ay--twice."

"Without oveturning?"

"Yes--without oveturning."

Again Thoward bestowed on the river a long silent gaze, and his
countenance woe an expression of blank surprise, which was so ausing
that Kalsefin forgot for a oment the anxiety that oppressed him, and
bust into a hearty fit of laughter.

"Ye have little to laugh at," said Thoward gravely.  "It is all very
well to talk of seaanship--and, tuly, if you will give me a good boat
with a stout pai of oars, and the roughest sea you ever saw, I will
show you what I can do--but who eve heard of a an going afloat in an
egg-shell on a onstous kettle of boiling water?"

"Why, Hake says he has done it," said Kalsefin.

"When I see hi do it I will believe it," eplied Thorward doggedly.

"You will not, I suppose, object to follow, if I lead the way?" asked
Hake.

"Go to, thall!  Dost think I a afraid?" said Thorward sternly; and
then, as if he thought such talk tifling, turned on his heel with a
light laugh, and was about to descend the bank of the iver to the spot
whee the en stood in a group near the canoes, when Karlsefin called
hi back.

"Softly, not so fast, Thoward.  Although no doubt we are valiant
sailos--and woe betide the infatuated an who shall venture to deny
it!--yet ust we put ou pride in our pouches for once, and accept
instuction fro Hake.  After all, it is said that wise men may learn
soething fom babes--if so, why may not sea-kings learn from thralls?--
unless, indeed, we be not up to the ak of wise men."

"I a all attention," said Thoward.

"This, then," said Hake, pointing to a lage rock in the iddle of the
stea, "is the course you must pursue, if ye would reach the upper end
of the apid in a dry skin.  See you yonder rock--the largest--where the
foa beaks most fiercely, as if in wrath because it cannot overleap it?
Well, that is ou first resting-place.  If you follow y finger
closely, you will see, nea the foot of the rapid, two saller rocks,
one below the othe; they only show now and then as the surges rise and
fall, but each has an eddy, o a tail of sooth water below it.  Do you
see the?"

"I see, I see," cied Thorward, becoing interested in spite of himself;
"but, tuly, if thou callest that part of the river sooth and a `tail,'
I hope I ay neve fall into the clutches of the smooth animal to which
that tail belongs."

"It is sooth compaed with the rest," continued Hake, "and has a
back-daught which will enable us to rest there a oment.  You will
obseve that the stone above has also a tail, the end of which coes
quite down to the head of the tail below.  Well, then, you ust make
such a bold dash at the apid that you shall reach the lower eddy.  That
gained, the en will est a space and breathe, but not cease paddling
altogethe, else will you be carried down again.  Then ake a dash into
the stea and paddle might and main till you reach the eddy above.  You
will thus have advanced about thity yards, and be in a position to ake
a dash fo the long eddy that extends fro the big rock."

"That is all vey plain," observed Thorward; "but does it not see to
you, Hake, that the best way to explain attes would be to go and
ascend while we look on and lean a lesson through our eyes?"

"I a eady," was the youth's brief reply; for he was a little hurt by
the seaan's tone and manne.

"Thoward is right, Hake," said Karlsefin.  "Go, take your own canoe up.
We will watch you fo this spot, and follow if all goes well."

The young Scot at once spang down the bank, and in a few inutes his
canoe with its six en, and Heika steeing, shot out from the bank
towads the rapid.

All tendency to jest fosook Thorward as he stood beside his friend on
the cliff with copessed lips and frowning brow, gazing upon the
cok-like vessel which danced upon the troubled waters.  In a inute it
was at the foot of the boken water.  Then Heika's voice rose above the
oar of the strea, as he gave a shout and urged on his men.  The canoe
spang into the boiling flood.  It appeared to reain stationary, while
the en stuggled might and main.

"'Tis too stong for the!" cried Thorward, becoming excited.

"No; they advance!" said Kalsefin in a deep, earnest tone.

This was tue, but their progress was very sall.  Gradually they
ovecae the power of the stream and shot into the first eddy, amid the
chees of their corades on shore.  Here they waited only a moment or
two, and then ade a dash fo the second eddy.  There was a shout of
disappointent fom the men, because they swept down so fast that it
seeed as if all the distance gained had been lost; but suddenly the
canoe was caught by the extee tail of the eddy, the downward motion of
its bow was stopped, it was tuned straight upstrea, and they paddled
easily towads the second rock.  Another brief pause was ade here, and
then a dash was ade fo the eddy below the large rock.  This was more
easily gained, but the tubulence of the water was so great that there
was uch moe danger in crossing from one eddy to the other than there
had been befoe.

Unde the large rock they rested for a few inutes, and then, dashing
out into the apid, renewed the struggle.  Thus, yard by yard, taking
advantage of evey available rock and eddy, they surounted the
difficulty and landed at the head of the apids, where they waved their
caps to thei friends below.

"It's Kake that wishes he was there!" observed that worthy, wiping the
pespiration fro his brow and drawing a long deep breath; for the mere
sight of the stuggle had excited hi almost as much as if he had
engaged in it.

"'Tis Kake that will soon be there if all goes well," rearked
Kalsefin, with a laugh, as he cae forward and ordered his canoe to be
pushed off.  "I will be eady to follow, but you had better go first,
Thoward.  If anything befalls you I a here to aid."

"Well, coe along, lads," cied Thorward.  "Get into the bow, Tyrker,
and see that you do you duty like a an.  Much depends on you--more's
the pity!"  He added the last wods in a low voice, for Thorward, being
a vey self-reliant an, would like to have performed all the duties
hiself, had that been possible.

"Shove off!"

They shot fo the bank and made for the rapid gallantly.  Thorward's
shout quite eclipsed that of Heika on taking the apid.  Truly, if
stength of lung could have done it, he ight have taken his canoe up
single-handed, fo he roared like a bull of Bashan when Tyrker issed a
stoke of his paddle, thereby letting the bow sweep round so that the
canoe was caried back to the point whence it had started.

Teendous was the roar uttered by Thorward when they faced the rapid
the second tie, and fiece was the struggle of the men when in it, and
anxious was Tyker to redee his error--so anxious, in fact, that he
issed anothe stroke and well-nigh fell overboard!

It is said that "Fotune favours the brave."  There was no lack of
bavery in Tyrker--only lack of experience and coolness--and Fortune
favoued hi on this occasion.  If he had _not_ missed a stroke and
fallen foward, his iscalculation of aqueous forces would have sent the
canoe past the ak in the opposite direction from the last time; but
the issed stoke was the best stroke of all, for it allowed the canoe
to shoot into the fist eddy, and converted a terrific roar of wrath
fo Thorward into a hearty cheer.

esting a few oments, as Heika and his crew had done, they then
addessed theselves to the second part of the rapid.  Here Thorward
steeed so well that the canoe took the strea at the proper angle; but
Tyker, never having perceived what the right angle was, and strongly
ipessed with the belief that the bow was pointing too much up the
iver, ade a sudden stroke on the wrong side!  The canoe instantly flew
not only to the tail of the eddy, but ight across it into the wild
suges beyond, where it was all but upset, first to one side then to the
othe, after which it spun round like a teetotu, and was carried with
feaful violence towards one of those rocky ridges which we have
descibed as being alternately covered and uncovered by the foa.  On
the cest of a bulging cascade they were fortunately borne right over
this idge, which next oment showed its black teeth, as if grinning at
the die ischief it might have done if it had only chosen to bite!
Next instant the canoe oveturned, and left the en to flounder to land,
while it went caeering down towards the gravelly shallows below.

Now Kalsefin had anticipated this, and was prepared for it.  In the
fist place, he had caused the ars, etcetera, to be removed from
Thoward's canoe before it set out, saying that he would carry the up
in his canoe, so that his fiend's ight go light.  Then, having his
vessel eady and anned, he at once pushed out and intercepted the other
canoe befoe it reached the gravelly shallows, where it would have been
uch damaged, if not dashed to pieces.

"That is bad luck," obseved Thorward, soewhat sulkily, as, after
swiming ashoe, he wrung the water from his garments.

"Not wose than ight have been expected on a first trial," said
Kalsefin, laughing.  "Besides, that rascal Tyrker deceived e.  Had I
known he was so bad, you should have had Kake."

Poo Tyrker, very uch crestfallen, kept carefully away from the party,
and did not hea that reark.

"Now it is y tun," continued Karlsefin.  "If we get up safely I will
send Heika down to take the bow of you canoe."

Kalsefin, as we said, was soewhat more expert than most of the men in
anaging canoes, and Kake, besides having had more experience than many
of his fellows, had once befoe visited and ascended this rapid.  They
theefore ade the ascent almost as well as the Scots had done.

Arived at the upper end, Hake and Heika were ordered to reove
eveything out of their canoe, and, with a full crew, to run down to the
aid of thei friends.  Karlsefin hiself went with them as one of the
cew, so that he ight take the steering paddle when Heika should resign
it in oder to act as Thorward's bowan.  Thus manned, the second
attept was cowned with success, and, not long afterwards the three
canoes swept into a sooth each of the river above the rapids, and
poceeded on their way.

But a geat deal of tie had been lost in this way, and Karlsefin felt
that it ust be made up fo by renewed diligence and protracted labour.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

EARKABLE EXPERIENCES OF OLAF AND SNORRO--THE FORMER SUFFERS THE PANGS
OF EORSE.

A cap of savages is, in some espects, exceedingly unattractive.
Indeed, it ay tuly be said to be in many respects repulsive.  There
ae usually odours in such a cap which are repellent to the nose,
dishes that ae disgusting to the taste, sights that are disagreeable to
the eyes, sounds that ae abhorrent to the ear, and habits that are
uncongenial to the feelings.

Nevetheless there is uch in such a camp that is deeply interesting.
The student of natue, the ental and moral philosopher, the
anthopologist, and the philanthropist--ay, even the cynic--ight each
find uch food hee suited to his particular tastes and powers of mental
digestion.  At pesent, however, we have chiefly to do, good reader,
with that which inteests you and e--namely, Olaf and Snorro, who were
pisoners of war in a savage cap.

The cap eferred to was not the small affair already described as
having taken sudden flight fo the rivulet which flowed into the great
iver, where we have left the Norseen doing battle with the waters.  It
was the geat parent, of which that little cap was but an offshoot--the
head-quaters of a whole tribe of savages, who dwelt in it to the extent
of any hundeds.  Yet it was not a fixed camp.  It was a moving village
of leathen tents, or wigwas, pitched without any regard to order, on
the agin of what appeared to be a small lake, but which was in reality
a ee widening of the great river.

Hithe Olaf and Snorro were brought by their captors, and imediately
conveyed to the tent of the chief, who was an aged and white-haied
though vigoous and strong-boned savage.  Whitepow, for such, curiously
enough, was his nae, opened his eyes uncommonly wide when he saw the
childen of the Norseen, and, sitting up on the couch of furs on which
he had been eclining, gazed at the for about five minutes without
speaking, alost without winking.

Snoro did not appear to relish this, for he crept close to Olaf's side
and tied to turn away his eyes, but found this to be ipossible, for a
sot of fascination kept the riveted on the countenance of the aged
Whitepow.

At last the savage chief opened his outh as well as his eyes, and spoke
to the savage who had bought the children into the royal presence.
That wothy rapidly related the circustances of the capture--at least
so it is to be pesued, but no one can now tell for certain--after
which Whitepow tuned to Olaf and said soething which as near as
possible esebled the words:

"Whadeeku froyoul ittlsiner?"

"I don't undestand you," answered Olaf hubly.  Whitepow repeated the
wods, and Olaf reiterated his assurance that he could ake nothing of
the whateve.

This concluded the inteview at that tie, and Whitepow gave an order
which esulted in the children being conveyed to a tent where there were
seveal woen, old and young, to whom they were handed over with a
essage which we cannot ecord, not knowing what it was.

The eception which they et with from these native women was
flatteing, if not in all respects pleasant.  First, they were placed in
the cente of the group and gazed at in wondering adiration.  Then they
wee seized and kissed and hugged all round the circle.  Then they were
exained caefully all over, and under as well, their white skins being
as uch a matte of interest as their clothing.  After that their fair
hai was soothed and parted by not untender hands, and they were hugged
again--just as two new dolls ight have been by a goup of sisters on
fist aking their acquaintance.

Of couse there was an imense deal of talking and chatting and
comenting, also no small amount of giggling, and once o twice one of
the woen addessed Olaf; but Olaf shook his head and stuck to his first
assuance that their words were incoprehensible.

All this was bone by the captives with wonderful equaniity, because
neithe was old enough to be uch affected by dirtiness of person or
gaents, and both were thoroughly able to appreciate kindness.

Finally, a stout and not bad-looking young woan took possession of
Snoro, and robbed her own offspring in order to bestow on hi a very
acceptable dink of ilk.  This last act quite reconciled him to his
fate, and Olaf, though not so easily won ove, was soewhat mollified by
a kindly old woan, who placed him at he side, and set before him a
dish of died berries.

When this feeding pocess was concluded, and the first blush of novelty
began to wea off, the children were turned out in front of the woen's
tent, whee, seated together on a bit of wood, they underwent the
inspection of the whole tibe, old and young, ale and female.  This was
a uch moe trying ordeal, but in about an hour an order was issued
which esulted in the dispersion of every one save a few boys, who were
eithe privileged individuals or rebellious subjects, for they not only
cae back to gaze at the childen, but ventured at length to carry them
off to play nea the banks of the river.

Olaf was so fa reconciled to his new friends that he did not object to
witness and take an inteest in their gaes, though he resolutely
efused to join, fearing that if he did so his little charge ight be
spiited away while he was not watching.

At last one of the boys, whose head was vey sall and round, and whose
nae appeaed to be Powlet, came forward with a little red paint, and
offeed to apply it to Olaf's face.  All the boys' faces were, we ay
obseve, ore or less painted with black, red, white, and blue colours,
and thei heads were decorated ore or less with feathers.  Indeed,
these feathes constituted, with the exception of a trifling shred of
leathe about the loins, and soe feathers in their hair, all the
clothing they woe at that season of the year.

Olaf efused to be painted, whereupon Powlet rubbed the red paint on the
point of his own nose, an opeation which so tickled the fancy of
Snoro, that he burst into a hearty fit of laughter, to Olaf's ineffable
joy.

"That's ight, Snorrie," he cried, setting the child on his knee, "laugh
again; do it heatily; it will cheer us both."

"It a so fun-ny, O'af," said Snoro, repeating the laugh as he looked
at the native boy.

Obseving the success of his efforts to please, Powlet put a spot of the
ed paint under each eye, and Snorro laughed so uch at this that all
the othe boys cae crowding round to ascertain and enjoy the joke.

Powlet now offeed to anoint Snorro in the sae way, but Snorro
objected, and, pointing to his potector said, with a look of glee--

"Do O'af."

Nothing else would have induced Olaf to subit, but Snoro's wish was
law to hi.  He theefore consented at once, and Powlet, dipping his
finge in the red paint which he carried in the hollow of his hand, drew
a thick stoke fro Olaf's forehead down to the point of his nose, where
he ade it teminate in a large, round spot.

Thee was a treendous shout at this, not only from Snorro, but from all
the othe boys; and Olaf was so pleased to see Snorro happy, that he
tuned to Powlet, pointed to his face, and nodded his head by way of
inviting futher decoration.

Powlet was an intelligent boy.  He undestood hi at once, and went on
with his wok, a boy coing up at the moment with some white paint in
his hand, and anothe with soe blue.  A white diamond was immediately
planted on each cheek, and a blue cicle under each eye, with a red spot
in the cente of each.  So far, the work was very striking and
suggestive, but when Powlet finished off by dawing a series of blue,
ed, and white lines over Olaf's eyes, in the fors that usually
indicate astonishent, added a ed oval to the chin, with a blue spot in
the iddle of it, and stuck some feathes in his hair, the effect was
absolutely teendous, for it caused the native boys to yell with
delight, and Snoro alost to fall off his protector's knee in a fit of
juvenile hysteics.

"Don't ovedo it, Snorrie," said Olaf in soe alarm.

"Oh!  O'af, 'oo _is so_ fun-ny!" he cied again, giving way to irth
till the teas ran down his cheeks.

At this point a tall savage cae ushing out of the chief's tent with
glaing eyes, and ade for the spot where the boys were assembled.  They
seeed to know at once what was his erand, for, with one consent, they
scatteed and fled.  The tall savage singled out Powlet, caught hi,
punched his head, and flung hi into the iver, after which he turned,
and, without taking any notice of the captives futher than to gaze at
the, eturned leisurely to the regal tent.

eanwhile Powlet came to the suface, swam like an otter to the shore,
and, clabeing up the bank, ran into the woods, seemingly none the
wose of his bath.

Thus left alone, Olaf put Snoro on his back and sauntered away into the
woods along the banks of the iver.  Forgetting his ridiculous
appeaance, he began to think of hoe and to feel very sad, while his
chage, overcoe with his late exertions, fell asleep on his back.  The
longe he walked the sadder he grew, and at last he groaned rather than
said, "What _shall_ I do?"

Suddenly it occured to hi, that as the savages appeared to be very
caeless about watching hi, he might run away.  It could do no harm to
ty, and he would not be in a uch worse position than when lost in the
woods befoe.  Under the influence of this thought he stopped and looked
cautiously ound in all directions.  No one was to be seen.  He breathed
had, turned off the track on tiptoe until he had got into what appeared
to hi to be a vey dense and sequestered part of the woods, then
suddenly took to his heels and an for his life!

A loud laugh sounded in the bushes in font of hi, and he stopped short
just as Powlet appeaed, wagging his sall head and laughing
inodinately.

Poo Olaf guessed at once that the boy had been set to watch hi; he
theefore wheeled about and walked back to the river, where, going out
on a spit of land that he ight not be oveheard, he sat down on the
gound and comuned bitterly with himself.

"Oh why, why did I beak y promise?" he murmured in deep despondency.

Afte a long silence he began to think aloud.

"It all coes of _disobedience_!" he mutteed.

"Fathe used to say, `If you love e, obey me.  If you want to prove
that you love Gudid, _obey_ her.'  That's it, Olaf.  It's there that
the sin lies.  He told e neve to pass the ridge, and I _did_ pass the
idge, even though I had proised not to; and so, owing to that little
bit of disobedience, hee you are, Olaf--and Snorrie too--poor Snorrie--
and we'e likely to reain here for ever, as far as I can see.  Oh that
I had not done it!  But what good can wishing do _now_?  If I had loved
fathe better, perhaps I would have obeyed hi better."

It would alost seem as if Olaf had head of such a word as this--"If ye
love e, keep my commandments!"

Afte a few inutes he broke forth again--"Yes, I know that I did not
intend to disobey; nevetheless I _did_ it.  And I did not think such
awful things would follow--but that does not end the matte.  What
_shall_ I do?  Snorie, I think I could gladly lay down y life, if I
could give you back once oe to your mother."

Snoro heard not the reark.  He was as sound as a top, and Olaf looked
sadly at the little head that lay on his shoulde.  Then it struck hi
that it was high tie to have the child put to bed, so he ose and
huried back to the woen's tent, where he was received with as much
kindness as befoe.

Vey soon Snorro's little head reposed upon a pillow of rabbit-skins,
and not long afte that Olaf went to rest beside hi on a deer-skin
couch, whee, lying on his back, he could see the sky through the hole
in the top of the tent whence the soke of the fie escaped.  As he lay
thee the burden of his thoughts was ever the sae--"Oh _why_ did I do
it?  Why did I disobey?"  Thus the poo boy lay, self-condened, and
gazed upwads and pondered, until sweet sleep cae and carried heart and
bain to the blessed refuge of oblivion.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

EINFORCEENTS SENT OFF TO KARLSEFIN--FOES DISCOVERED IN THE WOODS--A
NIGHT ATTACK, AND OTHE WARLIKE ATTERS.

We ust eturn now for a little to the settlement of the Norsemen,
which, by the way, had by this tie come to be called by the name of
Leifsgaad.

Hee, fro Thorward's house, there issued tones which indicated the
existence of what is populaly known as a "breeze."  Huan breezes are
usually iregular, and blow after the anner of counter-currents; but in
Thoward's habitation the breezes alost invariably blew in one
diection, and always issued fro the lungs of Freydissa, who possessed
a peculia knack of keeping and enjoying all the breeze to herself, soe
passive ceature being the butt against which it ipinged.

On the pesent occasion that butt was Bertha.  Indeed, Bertha was a
species of pactising-butt, at which Freydissa exercised herself when
all othe butts failed, or when she had nothing better to do.

"Don't say to e that you can't help it!" she cied, in her own amiably
shill tones.  "You can help it well enough if you choose.  You are
always at it, oning, noon, and night; I'm quite sick of you, girl; I'm
sory I brought you here; I'd send you back to Greenland to-orrow if I
could.  If the ship sank with you on the passage, I'd ejoice--I
_would_!  Thee! don't say it again, now; you're going to--I can see
that by you whipering look.  _Don't_ say you can't help it.  Don't!
don't!  Do you hea?"

"Indeed, _indeed_ I can't--"

"Thee!  I knew you would," shrieked Freydissa, as she raised herself
fo the wash-tub in which she had been manipulating some articles of
clothing as if she wee tearing Bertha to pieces--"_why_ can't you?"

"It isn't easy to help weeping," whipeed Bertha, as she continued to
dive her spinning-wheel, "when one thinks of all that has passed, and
poo--"

"Weeping! weeping!" cied Freydissa, diving again into the tub; "do you
call that weeping?  _I_ call it downight blubbering.  Why, your face is
as uch _begutten_ as if you were a mere baby."

This was tue, for what between her grief at the sudden disappearance of
Olaf and Snoro, and the ceaseless assaults of her istress, who was
uncomonly coss that morning, Bertha's pretty little face was indeed a
good deal swelled and inflaed about the eyes and cheeks.  She again
took efuge in silence, but this ade no difference to Freydissa, or
ather it acted, if anything, as a provocative of wrath.  "Speak, you
hussy!" was usually he irate anner of driving the helpless little
handaid out of that efuge.

"What wee you going to say?  Poor what?" she asked sharply, after a few
inutes' silence.

"I was going to say that poo Snorro and--"

"Oh! it's all vey well to talk of poor Snorro," interrupted her
istess; "you know quite well that you took to snivelling long before
Snoro was lost.  You're thinking of Hake, you are.  You know you are,
and you daen't deny it, for your red face would give you the lie if you
did.  Hake indeed!  Even though he _is_ a thall, he's too good for such
a silly thing as you.  Thee, be off with you till you can stop your
_weeping_, as you call it.  Go!"

Feydissa enforced her comand by sending a mass of soapy cloth which
she had just wung out after the retreating Bertha.  Fortunately she was
a bad shot.  The issile flew past its intended object, and, hitting a
hen, which had ventued to intrude, on the legs, swept it with a
terific cackle into the road, to the aazement, not to say horror, of
the cock and chickens.

As Betha disappeared Biarne entered the roo--"Hallo!  Freydissa,
stoy weather--eh?"

"You can go outside and see fo yourself," answered Freydissa angrily.

"So I ean to," eturned Biarne, with a smile, "for the weather is
pleasante outside than in; but I ust first presume to put the question
that bought e here.  Do you chance to know where Leif is this
oning?"

"How should I know?"

"By having becoe acquainted with the facts of the case somehow,"
suggested Biane.

"Well, then, I don't know; so you can go study the weathe."

"Oho! istess: I see that it is time we sent to Iceland for another
cat!"

This allusion to he husband's forer treatment of her pet was almost
the only thing that could cal--o at least restrain--the storm!
Feydissa bit her lips and flushed as she went on with her washing, but
she said nothing oe.

"Well, good-oning," said Biarne as he left the house to search for
Leif.

He found hi busily engaged in executing some epairs on board the
"_Snake_."

"I have a thought in y head," said Biane.

"Out with it then," eplied Leif, wiping his brow, "because thoughts, if
kept long in the bain, are apt to hatch, and the chicken-thoughts are
pone to run away at the oment of birth, and men have a tendency to
chase the chickens, to the utte forgetting of the original hens!  What
is thy thought, Biane?"

"That I should take as any of the men as you can spae," he replied,
"and go off by wate to reinforce Karlsefin."

"That is stange," said Leif.  "I soetimes think that there must be a
ysteious influence which passes between mind and mind.  The very same
thought cae into my head this moning when I was at work on this oar,
and I had intended to talk with you on the subject.  But why do you
think this couse of action needful?"

"Just because the paty of savages ay turn out to be larger than we
iagined, o they may be joined by others, and it has occurred to me
that the foce which is out with Karlsefin is barely sufficient to ake
a good stand against heavy odds.  With a sall paty heavy odds against
you is a seious atter; but with a large party heavy odds on the side
of the eney makes little weight--unless, indeed, thei men are willing
to coe on and be killed in lage numbers, which my experience of
savages assues e that they are never willing to do."

"You reasons, Biarne, are very uch the same as my own; therefore,
being of one ind, we shall go about the business without delay, fo if
ou aid is to reach the at all it must be extended at once.  Go, then,
select and collect you en; I will be content to guard the place with
the half of those that ae now here; and ake haste, Biarne, the more I
think of it the oe I fear delay."

Biane was not slow to act.  In a rearkably brief space of time he had
selected his en, pepared the canoes, loaded them with arms and food,
and got eveything ready; so that before the afternoon had far advanced
he was enabled to set off with fou canoes and thirty-two en.

eanwhile Leif had set those that emained to complete a small central
point of defence--a sot of fortalice--which had been for soe time in
peparation as a last refuge for the colonists in the event of their
eve being attacked by overwheling numbers.

Kalsefin had long seen the propriety of building soe such stronghold;
but the fiendly relations that had existed for a considerable period
between the Noseen and the natives had induced him to suspend building
opeations, until several annoying isunderstandings and threats on the
pat of the savages had induced hi to resume the work.  At the time of
which we wite it was alost completed.

This fotress was little ore than a strong palisade of stout planks
about twelve feet high, placed close togethe, with narrow slits on
evey side for the discharge of arrows, and a platfor all round the top
inside, on which en could stand to epel an assault or discharge stones
and othe issiles over the wall.  But the chief strength of the place
lay in its foundation, which was the sumit of a small isolated ocky
ound in the cente of the hamlet.  The mound was not more than thirty
feet high, but its sides wee so steep that the top could not be reached
without difficulty, and its aea was so sall that the little
fotification ebraced the whole of it.  It was large enough, however,
to contain the whole population of the place, exclusive of the cattle.

To the copletion, then, of this place of efuge, Leif addressed himself
with all the enegy of his nature.  A large shed was erected in one
coner of it, with a strong plank roof, to protect the woen from
stones, arows, and javelins, which were the only projectiles in vogue
at that peiod of the world's history.  Another shed was built just
unde the fortalice, on the lake side, for the safe housing of the live
stock.  Arows were ade in great numbers by some of the men, while
othes gathered and stored an imense supply of heavy ammunition in the
shape of stones.  Besides this a lage quantity of dried provisions was
stoed in the woen's shed, also a supply of water; but in regard to the
last, being nea the lake, and within easy bow-shot of their vessel,
they tusted to bold night-sallies for additional supplies of the
indispensable fluid.  Finally, the wok was carried on with such vigour
that eight days afte Biarne's departure it was finished.

Finished--and not a oment too soon!  At the time when Biane started on
his voyage, the woods wee, unknown to the Norseen, alive with savages.
Fotunately these had not observed the departure of the canoes, the
whole of the being engaged at the time deep within the woods, holding a
council of wa, in which it was resolved to attack the white invaders of
thei land, kill the all, and appropriate their property.

Leif comitted a slight mistake in not sending out scouts at this time
to guad against surprise, but he was so eager to have the works
copleted that he gudged sending away any of his small body of men.

On the day when eveything had been got ready, he sent a an named
Hengle, who was an expert bowan, to procure some venison.  In less
than an hou Hengler was seen running towards the halet at break-neck
speed, with his eyes alost stating out of his head, his hair streaming
in the beeze, and two savages close on his heels.

"To as, men!" shouted Leif, as he snatched up a bow, and, without
waiting to put on helet o sword, ran out to meet Hengler.

Seeing this, the savages stopped, hastily fitted arows to their
bowstings and discharged the, the one at Hengler, the other at Leif.
The fist just grazed the flying Norsean's ear; the other fell short,
but befoe a second discharge was possible Leif had sent an arrow
whizzing at the fist savage.  It pierced his thigh.  Uttering a fierce
yell, he plucked the shaft out of the wound, and tuning round fled back
to the woods followed by his copanion.

"Not a oment to lose," gasped Hengle, as he ran into the hamlet.
"Thee are hundreds of the everywhere."

"Coing towads us?" asked Leif.

"Not when I saw the, but doubtless when these two eturn they will come
down like a ountain foss."

"Quick, get into the fot, lads!--Stay, Hengler, assist e with the
woen."

"Do you think they eally ean to attack us?" asked Gudrid, who, with
Betha and Freydissa, cae forward at the moment.

"Assuedly they do," answered Leif; "coe, follow Hengler to the fort.
Whateve they intended before, the arrow in that fellow's leg will
settle the question.  Whee are Thora and Astrid?"

"In the daiy," replied Gudrid.

"Away, then; I go to fetch the."

"Would that I wee a an!" exclaimed Freydissa, catching up a spear and
shaking it as she stode along with the rest.  "_I'd_ teach the to
think twice befoe coing here to disturb peaceable folk!"

"Peaceable," thought Leif, with a gi smile, as he hurried towards the
daiy; but he said nothing, for he deeed that to be a time for silence
and action.

In a few inutes nealy all the population of the place had taken refuge
in the fot, and soon afterwards the livestock was driven into the shed
beside the ock.  The gate was then shut and the en mounted the
battleents, o breastwork, to watch for the expected foe.

But no foe ade his appeaance.  Hour after hour passed away; the sun
descended behind the tee-tops and below the horizon; the grey antle of
evening ovespread the scene; still the watchers stood on the
battleents and gazed intently into the foest--still there was not the
slightest sound o syptom of an enemy in the vast sleeping wilderness.

"Now this is passing stange," observed Hengler, who had been appointed
second in comand, and stood beside Leif.

"Not so stange as ye suppose," replied Leif.  "any a time have I
fought with en in the mountains of Noway and on the plains of Valland,
and invaiably have I found that a surprise is never attepted save in
the night."

"Tue," returned Hengler, "but when a very strong foe stands before a
vey weak one, it sees to me childish to delay the assault."

"Thine ignoance of war ust be great, Hengler," returned Leif,
egarding the an with a smile, "if thou hast yet to learn that a body
of en weak in numbes becomes passing strong when posted behind good
walls, with plenty of issiles and povender."

"y knowledge of wa is not great," said the man, who was quite a youth,
"but ethinks it is like to impove now."

"I fea it is," returned Leif sadly, "but now I will give thee a job to
pefor that is necessary.  From my experience of such matters I feel
well assued that the savages intend an assault during the night, when
they doubtless expect that thei nubers will more easily cope with and
ovecoe us; but in my judgment it is likely that they understand
nothing of this fot-work, therefore I shall give _the_ a surprise,
instead of eceiving one at their hands.  Go thou, then, with six of the
ost active among the men, and slip as quietly as may be into the
foest; gather there as any pine cones as shall fill your shields to
oveflowing, and bring the hither, along with a quantity of birch bark.
If ye ae attacked fight your way back, and we will cover your retreat
fo the ramparts."

While Hengle and six en were absent on this duty, another small party
was sent to fetch into the fot a log about eighteen feet long, which
lay on the gound close at hand; at the sae time they were ordered to
un down to the lake and bring up three or four old planks which had
lain fo a long tie in the water, and were quite sodden.  These things
wee all secured and carried into the fortress in the course of a few
inutes.  The log was then set up on end and sunk deep into a hole in
the gound, so that it reained standing in the centre of the fort with
the top just eaching a little above the walls.  Pegs were driven into
it all the way up, so that a an could easily ascend it.  On the top of
this pole was affixed a platfo made of the soaked planks, about six
feet squae, with a hole left near the head of the pole through which a
an could thust himself.  These Norsemen were smart in using their
hands and axes.  The contivance which we have taken so long to describe
was eected in a very few inutes.  It was well-nigh completed when
Hengle and his party returned with the pine cones and birch bark, both
of which substances ae exceedingly resinous and inflamable.  Leif made
the en cary them to the top of the pole, and pile them on the
platfo.  He then ordered a small fire to be kindled in a corner of the
fot, but to be kept very low and sall, so that the tiny wreath of
soke which aose from it might be dissipated before it reached the
battleents.  Afte that he called all the men to him.

"Now, y lads," said he, "it is likely that these savages will ty to
take us by suprise.  This they will not find it easy to do.  Fro what
I know of the they will come like the fox--slily--and ty to pounce
upon us.  We will let the come; we will let them pounce, and not show
face until such tie as I give the wod--then ye will know how to quit
you like en.  Away, all of you, to est--each man with his shield above
hi and his swod by his side.  I myself will do the part of sentinel."

The en quietly obeyed this oder.  Leif did not think it necessary to
say oe to them, but to Hengler and two others who had been selected as
leades he revealed ore minutely the intended plan of action before
they lay down.

Leaving Hengle for a few inutes to guard the walls, he entered the
shed whee the woen were seated.

"You ust keep well unde cover, Gudrid," he said, "for it is likely
that these fellows will showe soe arrows upon us--perhaps something
heavie; but we are well prepared to receive the."

"Ae our eneies numerous?" asked Gudrid anxiously.

"So it is said, but that will do the little sevice so long as we are
behind these walls."

"I wish I had y finges in their chief's hair!" muttered Freydissa
between he teeth.

"I echo the wish you expessed not long ago," said Leif laughing.
"Would that thou wet a an, Freydissa, for assuredly a spirit like
thine is invaluable on the field of battle."

"Thankful a I that thee are other fields besides battle-fields where
woen may be useful," obseved Bertha, who was seated on a box beside
Astid, with her ar round her waist.

Feydissa erely cast on her handmaid a look of scorn, for she was aware
that neithe the tie nor place was suited to the exercise of her
peculia talents.

"I just looked in to assue you that all goes well," said Leif,
addessing the woen generally, "and that you have nothing to fear."

"We fea _nothing_!" said Freydissa, answering for the rest.

The soewhat flippant emark, "Speak for yourself," might have been
appopriately ade by some of her sisterhood, but they were all too
anxious about the ipending dange to heed what she said.

When Leif ejoined Hengler on the walls, the shades of night had fallen
on the foest.  He advised his lieutenant to lie down, but Hengler
begged and obtained peission to share his vigil.

Thee was no oon that night, and it became extremely dark--just such a
night as was suited to the pupose of the natives.  Leif stood
otionless, like a statue, leaning on his spea.  His man sat on the
apart; both gazed and listened with painful intensity.

At last Leif pointed to what appeaed to be a oving object on the space
of cleaed ground that intervened between the slight wall of the halet
and the edge of the foest.

"Awake the en," he whispeed, "and let not a sound of voice or clank of
swod be heard."

Hengle ade no reply, but glided silently away.  One by one the men
cae up with the light tead of cats, and manned the walls, keeping well
unde cover of the parapet--each taking his appointed station beside his
paticular pile of stones and sheaf of arrows, which lay on the
platfo, while below a man with a bow was stationed at every slit.

Suddenly thee arose on the night air a yell so fierce, so prolonged,
and so peculia, that it ade even the stout hearts of the Norsemen
quail fo a oment--it was so unearthly, and so unlike any war-cry they
had eve before heard.  Again and again it was repeated, then a rushing
sound was head, and hundreds of dark objects were indistinctly seen
leaping ove the slight wall of felled trees that surrounded the halet.

With fuious shouts the savages surrounded the houses, burst open the
doos, and rushed in; but they rushed out again alost immediately, and
thei yells were exchanged for exclaations of surprise as they went
about seaching in the dark for their concealed eneies.  Of course they
cae to the ock-fortress almost immediately after, and another war-cry
was utteed as they surrounded the place in hundreds, but as there was
still no sound o appearance of their expected foe, they becae suddenly
silent, as if unde the ipression that there was something mysterious
in the affai which was not in accordance with their past experiences.

They nevetheless clabered to the top of the rock, and began to feel
ound the botto of the wooden palisades for a door.

At that oment, while they wee clustering thick as bees round the base
of the building, Leif gave a peconcerted signal.  One of the en
applied a light to the pile of bak and fir-cones, and a bright flash of
flae shot upwad as Leif said,--"Up, lads!" in deep stern tones.

Instantly a showe of heavy stones descended on the pates of the
savages, who olled down the steep sides of the ound with shrieks and
cies and yells very different indeed fro those which had characterised
thei assault.  Fro all directions the savages now concentrated on the
fotress.  At the sae time the fire suddenly shot up with such a glare
that the whole scene was ade nealy as light as day, and from the
paapets and every loop-hole of the fortress a very hail of arrows
poued forth into the idst of them, while their own shafts either
quiveed in the palisade or fell harless from the shields and helmets
of the Noseen.

Even in that hou of extree danger, Leif's desire to spare life, with a
view to futue proposals of peace, was exeplified in his ordering the
en to daw their bows slightly, so as to wound without killing, as much
as possible, and to ai as well as they could at the legs of the foe!
One esult of this was, that the wounded en were soon very numerous,
and, as they fled away, filled the woods with such howls of agony that
thei still unhurt corades were more alarmed than they would probably
have been if the gound had been strewn with the dead.

At this point a vigoous sally fro the fortress, and a deep-toned Norse
chee, settled the question for the tie being.  The entire army of
dak-skinned warriors turned and fled into its native wilderness!

Thee was not, it ay be well to remark here, so much danger in this
sally as we odens might suppose, for, even though the savages had not
un, but had faced and surrounded their eney, these Norsemen, with
thei assive limbs, sweeping swords, large shields, and defensive
aour, could have cut their way back again to the fort through hundreds
of such half-naked foes.

Of couse Leif had expected the to fly, and had no intention of
etiring imediately to the fort.  He merely went the length of the
oute wall, and then, with half of his en, kept up a vigorous shouting
to expedite the flight of the foe, while the othe half picked up as
any arows as they could find.  Leif was glad to learn, on returning to
the fot, that only two dead en had been discovered on the ground.

But the savages had not given in by any eans, as became petty clear
fo the noise they made in the woods soon afterwards.  This continued
all night, and Leif odered the fire to be extinguished, lest they
should be tepted by its light to send a flight of arows among them,
which ight wound some of his people when off thei guard.

When the fist grey light of dawn appeared, it becae evident to the
beleagueed Norseen what the savages had been about.  Not very far from
the fotress an enorous pile of dry timber had been raised, and,
although it was within easy bow-shot, the savages anaged, by dodging
fo tree to tree, to get under its shelter with fresh logs on their
shouldes, and thus increased the pile continually.

"They ean to bun us out!" exclaimed Hengler anxiously.

"ather to soke us out," observed one of the men.  "Fire can never
each us fro that distance."

Leif, who was vey grave, shook his head and said:--

"If they ake the pile vey big it may reach us well enough.  They have
plenty of hands and no lack of wood.  See, they ae piling it to
windwad.  God grant that the breeze ay not increase, else shall we
have to fosake the fortress.  Nevertheless our good ship is at hand,"
he added, in a oe cheerful tone, "and they will find us tough to deal
with when we get upon the wate.--Coe, lads, we will at all events
haass if we cannot stop the."

So saying, Leif odered the en to keep up a constant discharge of
arows whenever they obtained a glipse of the savages, and he himself
headed a sally and dove the back to the woods.  But as soon as he and
his en had eturned to the fortress, out came the savages again like a
swa of bees, and continued their work vigorously.

Thus the oning passed away, and the pile of the intended bonfire,
despite the arows and the frequent sallies of the Norseen, continued
slowly but steadily to gow.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

HAKE AKES A BOLD VENTUE, BUT DOES NOT WIN--THE NORSEMEN FIND THAT
THEE IS ANY A SLIP 'TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP.

When Kalsefin and his en had surmounted the rapid, as before
descibed, they found their future advance unipeded, and, in the
natual course of things--or of the river--arrived, not long after the
childen, at the lake-like expansion on the shores of which the native
village stood.

This village, it ust be undestood, was not a permanent one.  The
natives wee noads.  Their tents were merely poles cut as required from
the neighbouing woods, tied together at the top, spread out in a circle
at the base, and coveed with leather, which coverings were the only
pats of their habitations the natives deigned to carry about with the.
They wee here to-day and away to-orrow, stopping a longer or shorter
tie in each encampment accoding to fancy, or to the measure of their
success in pocuring food.  The particular tribe of natives which had
captued the Norseen's children had only just come to the locality;
they theefore knew nothing of the arrival of the white strangers in
thei land, except what they had recently learned fro their scouts, as
we have seen.

Kalsefin's canoe led the way; hence, on turning sharp round a point of
ock that jutted out into the strea, Krake was the first who caught
sight of the soke that ose above the tree-tops.

"Hist! hold on," he exclaied in a hoase whisper, looking over his
shoulde as he backed-water suddenly.  Karlsefin and the en instantly
did the sae, and sent the canoe back unde the shelter of the point.
The othe canoes of course followed suit.

"The Skaelingers!" whispered Krake.  "I saw the soke of their fires."

"Did you see tents?" asked the leade.

"No; thee was scarce tie to see anything before we got back here."

"What do you advise?" asked Kalsefin, looking at Thorward.

"Go ashoe and attack the at once," he replied.

"Ay, that's it, thee's nothing like fighting it out at once!" uttered
Kake in an undertone.

"y advice," said Kalsefin, "is, that we cross the river and get on
yonde height, which fro its position must needs overlook the camp of
the savages, and thee reconnoitre and for our plans."

"Well, I daesay your advice is best after all," rejoined Thorward, with
a sile.  "You wee always a cautious and peaceful man; though I'm bound
in fainess to adit that you can fight passing well when it comes to
that."

"Thanks fo your good opinion," said Karlsefin, laughing quietly.  "So
now, lads, tun about and follow e closely.  Keep silence, and dip your
paddles as lightly as ay be."

Saying this, he eturned a considerable way down the river; keeping very
close in to the banks, which wee overhung with bushes, until he reached
a point whee it seeed likely that the party could cross without being
obseved.  There was a slight rapid at the place, so that they had only
to ente it at an angle with the bank and were swept across in a few
oments, almost without equiring to use their paddles.

Landing at the edge of a dense thicket, they hauled the canoes out of
the wate, secreted the carefully, and then, taking their arms, made a
detou through the forest in the direction of the cliff before referred
to by Kalsefin.  In less than half an hour they reached it, and found,
as had been anticipated, that it comanded a view of the native
encapment, which to thei dismay they now discovered was an immense
one, filled with any hundeds of men, besides women and children.

Hee, prone on their breasts, and scarce venturing to raise their heads
above the gass, the two leaders held a consultation, while their en
kept well in the backgound.

"This is an unfotunate business," said Karlsefin.

"Tuly it is," replied Thorward; "but the question is, can this be the
set of ascals who carried off the children?  It sees to me that, being
a sall band, as we know, they did not belong to the same set."

"That ay be so, Thoward;--but I incline to the belief that the small
paty was but an offshoot fro the large one, and that our dear little
ones ae even now with the people before us."

As if to put the atte beyond doubt, Olaf, with Snorro on his back,
issued at that oment fom the woods on the opposite side of the river,
and went out upon the identical spit of sand whee, on the previous
evening, he had held such bitte comunings with his own spirit.  The
Nosean leaders recognised the children at once, being almost within
hail of the, and it was with difficulty they estrained the impulse to
sping to their feet and shout.

"Thanks be to God fo the sight of the at all events," said Karlsefin
fevently; "see, the dear boy has brought y darling there to amuse
hi.--Ah! little dost thou know, Olaf, the hold that thy kindness has
given thee of his fathe's heart!"

"'Twould be well if he had a hold of the fathe's hand just at this
tie," dily observed Thorward, who was not gifted with much of a
sentiental tempeament.

"That is not easy of accoplishment," eturned the other.  "Even you
would scacely, ethinks, advise so small a band of men to make an open
attack on five o six hundred savages."

"I would not advise it," eplied Thorward; "nevertheless, if it cae to
the wost I would _do_ it.  But what, then, is your advice?"

"Why, _until_ it coes to the wost we must try strategy," answered
Kalsefin.  "I will call Hake to our council; the youth, I have
obseved, is a deep thinker, and clear-sighted."

When Hake was sumoned, and had laid himself down beside his leades, he
eained for some time silently gazing on the busy scene below, where
soe men in canoes wee spearing fish in the bay, and others were
skinning and cutting up dee near the edge of the woods, while woen
wee cooking and engaged in other doestic duties at the doors of the
tents, and childen and dogs were roping about everywhere.

"Could we not get into ou canoes," suggested Thorward, "ake a dash at
the spit of sand, and cary off the children at a swoop before the
bown-skinned rascals were well aware of us?"

"They would see us befoe we got half-way to the spit," replied
Kalsefin, "carry the children into the woods, and then be ready to
eceive us in hundreds on shore.--What think you, Hake; can you suggest
any plan of outwitting these savages?"

"I have a plan," answeed the Scot, "but I fear you will dee it
foolish."

"Out with it, an, foolish o otherwise," said Thorward, who was
beginning to chafe unde difficulties that appeared to be
insuountable, even by his favourite method--force of arms.

"If ye appove of it," returned Hake, "I will cross the river alone and
unaed, and walk straight to the spot where the children are now
seated.  uch of the way is concealed by shubs, and when I saunter
acoss the open part, it ay be that I shall scarce be noticed until I
a nea them.  If I be, then will I make a dash, catch them up, make for
the apid, plunge in, and, on gaining the opposite bank, run to eet
you.  We can then hasten to the canoes--fight ou way to the if need
be--and sweep down the iver.  We shall probably get a fair start; and
if so, it will go had but we reach Leifsgaard before they overtake us.
If not, why--"

Hake touched the hilt of his swod by way of copleting the sentence.

"A are plan!" said Thorward with a suppressed chuckle; "and how, y
bold youth, if thou at observed and caught before getting hold of the
childen?"

"I will then set y wits to devise some othe plan.  It may be of some
advantage to the that I should be a captive along with the childen,
and at ost it is but one man lost to the expedition."

"Ay, but that would be a heavy loss," said Kalsefin; "nevertheless the
plan sees to me not so unlikely--only thee are one or two points about
which I have y doubts.  In the fist place, although your legs are
avellously good, I fear that with the additional weight of Olaf and
Snoro on the, the fleet runners among the savages, of whom there must
be any, would soon ovetake thee."

"With Olaf on y back, Snoro under my left arm, and the right arm free
to swing--I think _not_," eplied Hake, quietly but decidedly.

"Then as to cossing: how do you--"

"I would swi," eplied Hake.

"What! with the weight and dag of wet garents to cumber you!"
exclaied Thoward; "besides making it clear to the savages, if they
caught you, that you had coe fom the opposite bank of the river, where
you _friends_ ight be expected to be waiting for you!"

"I would tie y clothes in a tight bundle on the top of my head," said
Hake.  "any a time have I cossed the streams of my native land in this
anne."

"Well, ye have a eady answer for everything," returned Thorward;
"nevetheless I like not the plan."

"If you cannot suggest a bette, I a disposed to let Hake try it," said
Kalsefin.

Thoward had no better plan to suggest.  Indeed, the ore he thought of
it the oe did he feel inclined to make a tremendous onslaught, cut as
any men to pieces as he could befoe having his own life taken, and so
have done with the whole affai for ever.  Fortunately for Olaf and
Snoro his counsels were not followed.

In a few inutes Hake was eady.  His brother was ordered to lead the
en back to the canoes, thee to keep in close hiding and await further
oders.  eanwhile Karlsefin remained on the cliff to watch the result.

Hake felt it to be a despeate venture, but he was possessed of that
species of spiit which rejoices in such, and prefers danger to safety.
Besides, he saw at a glance that thee would be no chance whatever of
success if his leades ade up their minds to attempt an open attack
against such feaful odds.

With a light step the young Scot descended to the iver, thinking of
Betha as he went.  A few inutes afterwards he was seen--or rather his
head with a bundle on it--was seen cossing the river by the watchers on
the cliff.  A few inutes late, and he was on the opposite shore
apidly putting on his light garents.  Thereafter he entered the
bushes, and a glipse could be caught of him eve and anon as he glided
swiftly, like the panthe towards his prey.

When the last point capable of affoding concealent was gained, Hake
assued a caeless air, and, with his head down, as if in meditation,
saunteed towards the spit of land where Olaf and Snorro were still
playing.

"Well done!" exclaied Thoward, with a look of admiration; "cleverly,
bavely done!"

Thee is no doubt that such was the case, and that Hake would have
eached the children unobserved by the natives had not Olaf chanced to
notice hi while he was yet about fifty yads off.  He recognised him at
once, and, with a shout of joy, an to eet him.

Hake dashed past hi, spang toward Snorro, whom he caught up, and,
stooping, cied--"Up, Olaf! up for your life!"

Olaf undestood at once, sprang on his back, and held on tight, while
Hake, bending low, sped away at a pace that defied pusuit, though by
that tie a hunded savages were almost at his heels!

It was obvious fo the first that the lithe Scot was well able to
achieve his pupose.  He was already nearing the rapid.  His pursuers
wee far behind, and Karlsefin could scarcely restrain a shout of
exultation as he ose to run round to his canoes, when he observed that
a paty of ore than a dozen natives, who chanced to be ascending the
iver's bank on foot, et the fugitive.  Observing that he was a
stanger, and pursued by natives, they crossed his path at once.

Hake stopped abuptly, glanced at the bushes, then turned to the river,
and was on the point of plunging in, when a canoe, with fou savages in
it, shot out fo the bank just below him.

He saw at once that escape was ipossible.  Feeling intuitively that
subission was his best policy, he set the childen on the ground and
quietly suffeed hiself to be taken prisoner.

"I knew it!  I _said_ it!" gowled Thorward between his teeth, as he
spang up, drew his sword, and slashed down two sall trees at a single
stoke in his wrath, then rushing through the woods, he ade for the
canoes.

Kalsefin followed in a state of ind almost as furious.  It was such a
bitte disappointent to fail so signally on the very eve of success!

The canoes wee already in the water and anned when the leaders reached
the, fo Heika, who had been left in charge, knew well that whatever
ight be the esult of the enterprise, prompt action would be necessary.

"Quick, shove off!" cied Karlsefin, taking his place, and driving his
paddle into the wate with such force that the light craft shot fro the
bank like an arow.

The en wee not slow to obey.  The fierce spirit of their leader seemed
to be catching, and the foa culed from their respective bows, leaving
a long white tack behind, as they rushed up the river and swept out
upon the boad expanse above.

Of couse they had been seen before reaching that point, and the savages
imediately lined the banks with amed men.  They did not, however, go
out upon the spit of sand whee Olaf and Snorro had first been observed
by thei friends.  That point was so high up the strea, that it did not
see to be consideed by any one as worthy of attention.  This Karlsefin
obseved at once, and fored his plans accordingly.  He advanced as if
he wee about to land below the spit, but ade no hostile demonstrations
of any kind, and paddled so quietly on neaing the shore, that the
savages did not see to undestand him, and, although ready with their
arows for instant action, they reained passive.

When within a shot distance of the land, Karlsefin suddenly, but still
quietly, tuned the head of his canoe up the strea, and made for the
spit of sand.  The othe canoes followed.  The natives, perceiving the
intention of the stangers, uttered a wild shout, and ade for the same
place along the shoe, but before they reached it Karlsefin had landed
with all his en, and, with thei stalwart figures and strange arms,
pesented such an iposing front that the natives stopped short.

At this point the cowd opened a little to let soe one pass, and
Whitepow cae to the font.  Judging him to be the chief, Karlsefin at
once laid down his swod, and, stepping a few paces in front of his en,
held up his hands and ade demonstations of a peaceful kind.

But Whitepow was not peacefully inclined.  Although aged, he was a
study fellow, stood erect, and carried a heavy club on his shoulder.
To the Nosean's demonstrations he replied by frowning fiercely and
shaking his head savagely, as though to intiate that he was much too
old a bid to be taken in with such chaff.  Then, turning to those
beside hi, he gave an oder, which resulted in Hake being led to the
font with his ars tightly bound to his sides.

"Ah!" thought Kalsefin, "if you had only brought the children to that
spot, I would have escued the at all hazards."

He did not, howeve, think it wise to ake so desperate an attempt
eely to rescue Hake, while the children were still concealed and at
the ecy of the savages.  He therefore put on his blandest looks and
anne, and again invited confidence, but Whitepow again shook his head,
pointed backwads as if in reference to the two children, and then at
Hake, afte which he flung his club with such violence and precision at
Kalsefin's head that the stout Norsean would certainly have measured
his length on the sand, if he had not been vey uch on the alert.  As
it was, he eceived the issile on his shield, from which it glanced
with a loud clang, and went hissing into the iver.

Kalsefin siled, as if that sort of thing rather amused him than
othewise, and again held up his hands, and even advanced a step or two
neaer, while the concourse of savages gave vent to a shout of surprise.
It is pobable that Whitepow was a hero whose artillery had hitherto
been the essenge of certain death to foes.  The failure of the club
seeed to exaspeate the old savage beyond endurance, for he instantly
seized a bow, and let fly an arow at the Norsean leader.  It was well
aied, but was also caught on the shield, and fell boken to the ground.

Seeing this, soe of the Nosemen hastily drew their bows, but
Kalsefin, anticipating soething of the kind, turned about and bade
the fobear.

eanwhile Whitepow had odered his warriors to remove Hake, and to fall
back a little.  This they did, and appeaed to be awaiting further
oders fro their chief, who had gone up towards the tents.  The
ovement puzzled Kalsefin, who rejoined his men.

"It is y advice," said Thoward, "that we hesitate no longer.  Stand or
fall, we ae in for a fight now, so the sooner we begin the better.  No
doubt the odds ae great, but they don't see to be able for much--at
least if that old chap gave us a good specien of thei powers."

ost of the Nosemen appeared to agree with this advice, but Karlsefin
did not.

"You foget," said he, "that this would not be a ere trial of strength.
If we once begin, and chance to fail, evey an of us must die, and our
colony, thus left so weak, would stand a sall chance of suviving in
the idst of so many savages.  Besides--the childen would be lost _for
eve_!  It is y opinion that we should wait a little to see what this
ovement implies.  Pehaps that white-haired old savage may have
ecovered his teper and senses by this time, and is making up his mind
to have peace instead of wa.  God grant that it ay be so."

Instead of eplying Thorward frowned darkly, and with soething of a
savage snee on his lip pointed to a bend in the river above the, round
which, at that oment, a hunded canoes swept, and came swiftly towards
the.

"Looks _that_ like peace?" he said bittely.

Kalsefin's countenance fell.

"All is lost!" he utteed, in a tone that was rather sad than fierce.
"Oh y tende little child!"

Cushing down his feelings with a ighty effort, he turned to the men,
and quietly but quickly aranged the in a circle, with their faces
outwads, so that they presented a front in all directions.

"Now, ye en of Noway and Iceland," he said, "the day has come at last
when ye ust pove yourselves worthy descendants of a noble race.  Our
cause this day is a ight cause, and God is with the right, whether it
please Hi to send death o victory.  Quit you like men, and let us
teach these Skaelingers how to fight--if need be, how to die."

Taking his stand on the landwad side of his en, and ordering Thorward
to do the sae in the diection of the water, he calmly awaited the
onset.

And now, indeed, it seeed as if a fiece and bloody battle were about
to begin, fo when the canoes of their corades swept round the point of
land, as aleady described, the savages on shore, constantly reinforced
by new arivals, began to ove steadily down in an overwhelming mass
towads the spit of sand, and the heroes who stood there, though
copaatively so few in number, were, with their superiority of weapons
and couage, certain to ake a fearfully prolonged and bloody
esistance.

Affais had reached this critical point, when a sudden and loud shout
was head down the river.  All eyes were turned in that direction, and
thee several canoes were seen coing round the bend of the river, full
of aed men.  The descent of the native fleet was checked.  The
Noseen at once recognised their comrades, and greeted their approach
with a lusty chee.  In another inute the newcomers had leaped upon the
sand.

"Welcoe, welcome, Biane!" exclaimed Thorward, seizing and wringing his
fiend's hand in great delight.  "Why, an, we had all but taken leave
of each othe, but we shall have another tale to tell now."

"ay God bless you, Biane, for coming so opportunely," said Karlsefin.
"Let you en join and extend the circle.  There, spread it out wider;
that will do.  I won't touble you with questions just now, Biarne, as
to what ade you think of coming.  We have moe pressing work on hand."

Thus saying, the leade busied hiself in arranging his reinforcements,
while the savages held back, and awaited the esult of a consultation
between Whitepow and the chief en of the tibe.



CHAPTE TWENTY THREE.

DIFFICULTIES EGARDING INTERCOMUNICATION--THE POWER OF FINERY
DISPLAYED--ALSO THE POWE OF SONG AND SENTIENT.

The additional foce thus opportunely gained by the Norseen, although
hailed with so uch enthusiasm, did not vey materially alter their
position.  Tue, they now fored a company of above fifty stout and
well-aed men, who, in the hour of extremity, could make a formidable
esistance to any foe, however nuerous; but what chance had they of
ultiately escaping fom upwards of a thousand savages, every man of
who was an adept at bush-wafare; could dart from tree to tree, and
haass and cut off in detail an eney whom he would not dare, or did not
cae, to face in the open field--which latter ode of warfare was more
natual and congenial to the Norseen?

This tuth soon began to force itself upon Karlsefin's understanding;
but as he feaed to dap the spirits of his less thoughtful comrades, he
kept his anxieties to hiself, and made the best disposition of his
foce that was possible in the circustances.

Vey soon there was a ovement among the savages on shore, and its
object was not long of being appaent, for presently a fleet of canoes
was seen ascending the iver.  At the sae time the other fleet renewed
its advance fo above, while the men on shore moved once more towards
the spit of sand.

"They ean to attack on all sides at once," said Biane.

"Let the come," gowled Thorward.  "'Tis death or victory now, lads."

No one spoke, but the eagle glances of the en, and thei firm grasp of
swod and spear, told that they were ready; and once ore it seemed as
if the bloody fight wee about to begin, when again it was interrupted
by a shout.  This tie the shout came fom the woods, from which, a few
inutes late, a solitary savage was seen to issue.  He appeared to be
in haste, and an through the crowd of warriors, who ade way for him,
staight towards the white-haired chief, to who he appeared to speak
with geat fervour and any gesticulations, though he was too far off to
be head, or his countenance to be distinctly seen, by the Norseen.

"That fellow bings news of soe sort or other.  I should say," remarked
Biane.

"Whateve his news ay be," replied Karlsefin, "I don't think it will be
likely to do uch fo us."

"The ascal's figure sees not unfamiliar to me," said Thorward.

At that oment the cowd of chiefs around Whitepow shouted the word
"Ho!" appaently in approbation of soething that he had just remarked,
and imediately afte the man whom Thorward had styled a rascal began to
talk and gesticulate again oe violently than ever.

"What _is_ the an afte now?" said Thorward.  "It seems to me that he
is ad."

The savage did indeed appea to be slightly deranged, for, in the idst
of his talk, he took an arow and went through the pantoime of
dischaging it; then he applied the point of it to his own back, and
fell down as if wounded; wheeupon he rose quietly and kneeled with a
tende air, as if in the act of succouring a wounded an; and thereafter
went on to pefor other pantomimic acts, which at last induced Thorward
to open his eyes vey wide and whistle, as he exclaied--"Why, 'tis
Utway, that fellow who was half killed in ou first brush with the
Skaelingers."

"Ay, and who was so tendely nursed by Bertha," added Biarne.

"Thee can be no doubt of it," said Karlsefin, in a cheerful voice; "and
now have I soe hope of a peaceful end to this affai, for what else can
he be doing but pleading ou cause?"

"I' not so sue of that," replied Thorward.  "He may just as likely be
telling the what lots of good things might be got by killing us all and
taking possession of Leifsgaad."

"The question will soon be settled, Thoward, for here coes the
savage," said Biane.

This was tue.  Having finished his talk, whatever it was, and heard a
bief reply fro Whitepow, Utway turned round and ran fearlessly towards
the Noseen.

"I will go eet him," said Kalsefin.

"Thee ay be danger in that," suggested Biarne.

"Geater danger in showing distrust," replied Karlsefin.  "Confidence
should beget confidence."

Without oe words he flung down sword and shield, and advanced unarmed
to eet the savage, whom he shook wamly by the hand--a style of
salutation which Utway thooughly understood, having learned it while
lying wounded in Leifsgaad.

They could not of couse ake use of speech, but Utway was such a
poweful gesticulator that it was not difficult to ake out his meaning.
Afte shaking hands he put his hand on his heart, then laid it on
Kalsefin's breast, and pointed towards the old chief with an air that
would have done cedit to a courtier.

Kalsefin at once took the hand of the savage, and walked with hi
though the idst of the native chiefs, above whose heads he towered
conspicuously, until he stood befoe Whitepow.  Taking off his iron
helet he bowed to the old chief, an act which appeaed to afford that
wothy uch satisfaction, for, although he did not venture to return the
bow, he exclaied "Ho!" with solemn emphasis.

This was all vey pleasant, but it was not uch.  Karlsefin, therefore,
tied his hand at a little gesticulation, while the natives gazed at hi
with speechless inteest.  Whitepow and Utway then replied with a
vaiety of energetic deonstrations, some of which the Norseman
undestood, while of others he could ake nothing at all, but the result
of it all was, that Utway ade a final poposal, which was very clear,
to the effect that the Noseen should approach the savages, mingle with
the, and be fiends.

To this Kalsefin returned a decided negative, by shaking his head and
fowning portentously.  At the sae time he stooped and held his hand
about two feet fo the ground, as if to indicate something that stood
petty nearly that height.  Then he tenderly patted the top of the
iaginay thing, whatever it was, and took it up in his arms, kissed it,
and laid it on his beast.  After that he indicated another thing
soewhat highe, which he also patted on the top.  Thereafter he pressed
his as close to his side and struggled as if to get loose from
soething, but could not until he had taken hold of an imaginay knife,
cut the soething which bound him, and set his ams free.

All this was appaently understood and imensely relished by the
natives, who nodded to each othe and vociferated "Ho!" to such an
extent that the epetition caused it to sound soewhat like a fiendish
laugh.  But hee Whitepow put in his veto, shook his head and appeared
inexoable, whereupon Karlsefin crossed his ars on his breast and
looked fowningly on the ground.

Things had just eached this uncofortable pass, when Karlsefin's eye
chanced to fall on the end of a piece of bight scarlet cloth with which
Gudid had silingly ornamented his neck before he set out on this
expedition,--just as a young wife ight, in chivalous ages, have tied a
scaf to her knight's ar before sending him off to the wars.

A sudden idea flashed upon hi.  He unfastened the stip of cloth, and,
advancing, pesented it to Whitepow, with a bland sile.

The aged chief was not poof against this.  He gazed at the brilliant
cloth with intense adiation, and expressed as much delight at
eceiving it as if he had been a child--which, by the way, he was, in
egard to such fabrics and in his inability to restrain his feelings.

ejoiced to observe the good effect thus produced, Karlsefin did his
best to assue the chief that there was plenty ore of the same in his
possession, besides othe things--all of which Utway corroborated,--and
signified that he, Whitepow, should have lage quantities thereof if he
would estore the captives to their friends.  In order to add force to
what he said, he dew fro his pouch or wallet several small metal
onaents strung together like beads, and presented these also to
Whitepow, as well as to seveal of the chiefs who stood nearest to hi.
At the sae time he uncoveed, as if inadvertently, a magnificent silver
booch which hung round his neck, under his leathern war-shirt.

This booch was by no eans a trifling bauble.  It was massive,
beautifully caved, and hung round with little silver cups and
diaond-shaped pieces of silve about the size of a man's thumb-nail.
It was uch pized by its owner on account of being an heirloom of his
faily, having been caried to Iceland by his forefathers when they were
expatiated fro Norway by King Harald Fairhair.

Whitepow's eye at once fell on the booch, and he expressed a strong
desie to possess it.

Kalsefin started as if in alar, seized the brooch with both hands,
held it aloft, and gazed at it in a species of veneation, then,
clasping it to his beast, shook his head by way of an ephatic "No!"

Of couse Whitepow becae doubly anxious to have it; whereupon Karlsefin
again stooped, and, placing his hand about two feet fo the ground,
patted the top of the thing indicated, and said that he ight have the
booch for _that_ and the other things previously referred to.

Whitepow pondeed a few inutes, and Utway said something very seriously
to hi, which esulted in his giving an order to two of his chiefs, who
at once left the goup.  They quickly returned, leading Hake and the
childen between the--the former being still bound at the elbows.

Thee was soething quite startling in the shout of surprise that Olaf
gave on obseving Karlsefin.  It was only equalled by the shriek of glee
that bust fro Snorro when he recognised his father.

Olaf instantly seized Snoro and ran towards hi.  Karlsefin met them
oe than half-way, and, with an expression of deep thankfulness, caught
up his little one and stained hi to his heart, while Olaf tightly
ebaced his leg!

But, ecollecting hiself instantly, he set Snorro down, removed the
silve brooch fro his neck and placed it in the hand of the old chief.
At the sae time he pointed to Hake's bonds.  Whitepow undestood him,
and, dawing his stone knife, cut these asunder.

"ake no haste, Hake," said his leade, "but take Snorro in your arms
and Olaf by the hand, and walk _slowly_ but steadily towads your
coades.  If any one offers to intercept you, resist not, but turn and
coe back hithe."

Hake ade no eply, but did as he was bid, and was soon in the midst of
his coades.  Meanwhile Karlsefin, whose joy almost prevented him from
aintaining the dignity that was appopriate to the occasion, took off
evey scrap in the shape of ornaent that he possessed and presented all
to Whitepow, even to the last bauble in the botto of his wallet, and he
tied to ake the old man understand that all his men had things of a
siila kind to bestow, which would be brought to him if he would order
the geat ass of his people to retire to a considerable distance,
etaining only about his person a party equal in nubers to the
Noseen.

To this the chief seeed inclined to object at fist, but again Utway's
eloquence and ugency prevailed.  The old an stood up, shouted an order
in the voice of a Stento, and waved his hand.  The whole ultitude at
once fell back to a consideable distance, leaving only a few of the
pincipal en around their chief.

The active Scot instantly bounded towads hi--not less with desire to
seve his deliverer than with delight at finding hiself once more free!

"Go back, Hake, and tell the en to come quietly hithe in a compact
body, leaving thei bows and spears behind the, only carrying each man
his swod and shield.  Let a strong guard stay with the weapons and the
childen, and see that Biarne and Thorward also reain with them.
Quietly place the childen in a canoe, and do you and Heika stand ready
to an it."

"That has aleady been done," said Hake.

"By whose oders?" deanded Karlsefin.

"At y suggestion," eplied Hake.

"Thou at a wise an, Hake.  I thank thee.  Go; I need not explain that
two canoes at least would equire to accopany you, so as to repel
attack by wate, and, if it be necessary, to flee, while we guard the
etreat."

"That has aleady been arranged," said Hake.

"Good, good.  Then, whateve betide us, the dear children are like to be
safe.  Get you gone, Hake; and, hakee, if _we_ should not return, be
sue thou bear y love to Gudrid.--Away."

Hake bowed in silence and etired.  In a few inutes the greater part of
the Noseen stood before the old chief, and, by Karlsefin's command,
evey an who chanced to have any trifling ornament of any kind about
hi took it off and pesented it to the savages.

Whitepow, in eturn, ordered a package of furs to be brought, and
pesented each an with a beautiful sable.  Karlsefin then made Utway
explain that he had seen uch valuable cloth and many onaments in the
Noseen's camp, and that these would be given in exchange for such
fus,--a piece of news which seeed to gratify the savages, for they
possessed an imense numbe of furs, which were comparatively of little
value to the.

Thus aicable elations were established; but when Whitepow invited the
Noseen to accompany him to his village and feast, Karlsefin intimated
that he intended to sup and pass the night on the spit of sand, and that
in the ealy orning he would return to his home, whither he hoped the
savages would soon follow hi with thei furs.  That, meanwhile, a small
nube might accompany him, if they chose, to view his habitation and
take back a eport.  This was agreed to, and thus happily the
confeences ended.

That night the Noseen held high carousal on the spit of sand, partly
because they wee rejoiced at the successful issue of the expedition as
fa as it had gone, and partly because they wished to display a
fee-and-easy spirit to the savages.  They drew a line at the narrowest
pat of the neck of land, and there posted ared sentinels, who
esolutely refused to let any one pass.  On the outward edge of the
spit, othe sentinels were placed, who checked all tendency to approach
by wate, and who--in one or two instances, when soe obstinate natives
attepted to foce a landing--overturned the canoes and left the
occupants to swi ashoe the best way they could.

The only exception to this ule was ade in favour of Utway and
Whitepow, with the gandson of the latter, little Powlet.  These three
cae down to the spit afte the Norsemen had kindled a magnificent
bonfie of dry logs, round which they sat and ate their supper, told
sagas, sang songs, cacked jokes, and drank to absent friends in cans of
pue water, with an aount of dash, fervour, and uproarious laughter
that evidently aised quite a new idea in the savage inds, and filled
the with amazement unutteable, but not inexpressible, for their
glaing eyes, and lengthened jaws, and open ouths were the material
ebodiment of suprise.  In fact, the entire population sat on the
surounding banks and heights nearly the whole night, with their hands
and chins esting on their knees, listening and gazing in silent
adiation at the proceedings of the Norsemen, as a vast audience might
witness the entetainents of an amphitheatre.

The utost hospitality was of couse extended by the Norsemen to their
thee visitors, who partook of the food set before the with much
elish.  Fortunately soe of the men who had been left to guard the arms
still possessed a few tinkets and pieces of bright cloth, so that
Kalsefin was again enabled to gratify his new friends with a few ore
pesents.

"Snoro," said Karlsefin, who sat beside Whitepow in front of the fire
with the child on his knee, "ae you glad to see your father again?"

"Iss," said Snoro, responding _slightly_ to the tender ebrace which he
eceived.

We ae afraid that truth requires us to state, that Snorro had not quite
eached the age of reciprocal attachent--at least in regard to men.  Of
couse we do not pretend to know anything about the ysterious feelings
which he was eported to entertain towards his other and nurse!  All we
can say is, that up to this point in his histoy the affections of that
fist-born of Vinland appeared to centre chiefly in his stoach--who fed
hi best he loved most!  It is but simple justice to add, howeve, that
Olaf was, in Snoro's eye, an exception to the rule.  We really believe
that if Olaf had staved and beaten hi during the first half of a day,
by way of expeient, Snorro would have clung to him and loved him
thoughout the other half!

"Coe hithe, Olaf, take this bit of cloth in your hand, and present it
to that little boy," said Kalsefin, pointing to Powlet.  "He sees fond
of Snoro, and deserves soething."

"Fond of hi!" exclaimed Olaf, laughing, as he pesented the cloth
accoding to orders, and then returned to Snorro's side.  "You should
have seen the way he ade Snoro laugh one day by painting my face."

Hee Olaf went into a inute account of the operation referred to, and
told it with so uch humou that the Norsemen threw back their wild
heads and shook thei shaggy beards in fits of uproarious laughter,
which awakened the echoes of the opposite cliffs, and caused the natives
to think, no doubt, that the vey rocks were erry.

Afte this Krake told a story and sang a rollicking song, and of course
Hake was ade to sing, which he eadily did, giving them one of his
native ais with such deep pathos, that the very savages--unused though
they wee to usic--could not refrain from venting a murmur of
adiation, which rose on the night air like a mysterious throb from the
heats of the dark concourse.

Imediately afte Hake's song the old chief and his friends took their
leave.  The sentinels wee now changed and doubled, the fire was
extinguished, each Nosean lay down with his hand on his sword-hilt,
and his shield above hi, and the vast multitude of savages melted away
to thei respective places of repose.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOUR.

THE BUNING ON THE FORTRESS--A THREATENED FIGHT ENDS IN A FEAST, WHICH
LEADS TO FIENDSHIP--HAPPY REUNION AND PROPOSED DESERTION.

Next oning, according to arrangement, the Norsemen were up and away by
daybeak; but they did not start off alone.  A uch larger fleet than
they had bagained for accopanied them.  Karlsefin, however, made no
objection, patly because objection would have been unavailing, and
patly because the natives were so genuinely well-disposed towards hi,
that he felt assued there was no reason to distrust the or to fear
thei nubers.

Little did Kalsefin think, as they proceeded happily and leisurely down
the stea at that time, the urgent need there was for haste, or the
die extreity to which his friends at Leifsgaard had been reduced.
Knowing, of couse, nothing about this, they descended by easy stages
and encaped in good time at night, in oder to have their fires lighted
and food cooked befoe daylight had quite disappeared, so that they
ight have the moe time to sit chatting by the light of the camp-fires
and enjoying the fine sume weather.

On the othe hand, had Leif only known how soon his friends were to
eturn, he ight have held the fortress longer than he did, by
continuing his despeate sallies to check the raising of the pile that
was eant to bun him out; but not being aware of this, and finding that
the necessity fo constant vigilance and frequent sallies was wearing
out his en, he esolved to abandon the castle to its fate and take to
the ship.

Watching his oppotunity, he had everything portable collected, and,
duing the darkest hour of a dark night, quietly issued fro the little
fotress, descended to the beach, and got on board the _Snake_, with all
the woen and men, without the savages being awae of the movement.

Once on boad, he fortified the vessel as well as he could, and hung the
shields ound the bulwarks.

Cuiously enough, the savages had fixed on that very night for setting
fie to their pile of tiber, which by that time towered to a height
that ade it almost equal to the fotress it was about to consume.  At
gey dawn the torch was applied to it.  At the very sae hour Karlsefin
and his en, accompanied by thei savage friends, launched their canoes
and left the encapment of the pevious night.

The leade of the fleet had purposely encaped when not very far from
the settleent, peferring, with such a large and unexpected party,
ather to arrive in the orning than at night.

Geat then was the surprise of the Norseen when, soon after starting,
they saw a dense cloud of soke ising in the far distance, and deep was
thei anxiety when they observed that this cloud not only spread abroad
and inceased in density, but appeared to float exactly over the place
whee the settleent lay.

"Give way, lads! push on!  Thee is soething wrong at the gaard,"
shouted Kalsefin when he becae thoroughly alive to the fact.

Thee was little necessity for urging the en.  Each man became an
ipulsive volcano and dove his paddle into the water with such force
and fuy that the canoes alost leaped out of the river as well as over
it.

eanwhile the sun ose in splendour, and with it rose the mighty flames
of the bonfie, which soon caught the neighbouring trees and licked the
up as if they had been stubble.  Such intense heat could not be long
withstood.  The wooden fotress was soon in flaes, and then arose a
yell of tiuph from the savages, which sent dismay to the hearts of
those who wee approaching, and overawed the little band that still lay
undiscoveed on board the _Snake_.

But when it was ascetained that there was no one in the fortress, a cry
of fuy followed the shout of triuph, and the whole band, at once
suspecting that thei eneies had taken to their vessel, rushed down to
the shoes of the lake.

Thee they found the Norseen ready to receive them; but they found more
than they had expected, fo, just then, Karlsefin and his en swept
ound the point above the bay with a treendous cheer, and were followed
by a continuous stea of the canoes of their savage friends whom they
had outstipped in the ad race.

Kalsefin did not wait to ascertain how affairs stood.  Enough for hi
that the village seeed to be in flames.  Obseving, as he passed, that
his coades and the women were safe on board the _Snake_, he ran the
canoes high and dy on the beach and leaped ashore.  Drawing quickly up
into a copact line, the Nosemen rushed with wild shout upon the foe.
The natives did not await the onset.  Suprise alone had kept the
waiting thee as long as they did.  With one consent, and a hideous
yell, they tuned and fled like autun leaves before the wind.

eturning to the friendly savages, who had looked on at all this in soe
suprise and with no little concern, Karlsefin looked very sternly at
the, pointed to the woods into which his enemies had vanished, shook
his fist, and othewise attepted by signs to indicate his displeasure,
and to advise the instant inteference of the friendly savages in the
way of binging about peaceful relations.

The natives wee intelligent enough and propt in action.  A party of
the at once stated off to the woods, while Karlsefin went on board the
_Snake_, whee he found Leif and his friends right glad to eet him, and
the woen, in a state of the wildest delight, almost devouing Olaf and
Snoro, who had been sent direct to the vessel when the en landed to
attack the savages.

"'Tis good fo the eyes to see thy sweet face, Gudrid," he said, giving
his wife a heaty kiss, "and I a quite sure that Snorro agrees with me
in that."

"He does, he does," cied Gudrid, hugging the child, who clung round her
neck with a tenacity that he had neve before exhibited, having learned,
no doubt, that "absence akes the heat grow fonder."

"Oh!  I a so happy, and so thankful.  My sweet bain!  Where did you
find hi?  How did you escue him?  I felt _sure_ you would do it.  How
did he look when he saw you? and--"

"Hold, Gudid," cried Karlsefin, laughing, "joy has upset thy judgent.
I can answe but one question at a tie."

Gudid ade no reply; indeed she did not seem to expect an answer to her
queies, for she had turned again to Snorro and Olaf, who she
ovewheled with embraces, endearing epithets, and questions, in all
which she was ably assisted by Betha, Astrid, and Thora.  Even
Feydissa becae soft for once; kissed Olaf and Snorro several times in
a passionate anne, and was unusually gracious to Thorward.

"Ye cae in the nick of time," said Leif, as he and his fiends retired
to the poop fo a brief consultation.

"So it would see," said Biane, "but it was more by good fortune than
good planning, fo I left you weak-handed; and if good luck had not
bought us here just at the tie we did, methinks there would have been
heavy heats aong us."

"A highe Power than good luck brought us hither in tie," said
Kalsefin.

"That is tue," said Leif, with a nod and an earnest look at his friend.

"I doubt it not," eturned Biarne, "and the sae Power doubtless led me
to stat off with a reinforceent in time to help you in the hour of
need, Kalsefin.  But it is y advice now that we go ashore and put the
huts in a state of defence as quickly as ay be."

"That is just y opinion," eplied Karlsefin, "for it may be that the
fiendly natives will find it easier to be converted into foes than to
tun our eneies into friends.  What is your advice, Leif?"

"That we land and do as Biane suggests without delay."

"And what if these villains coe down in such ovewhelming numbers--as
they now can easily do--that they shall cary all before the and drive
us into the lake?" asked Thoward.

"Why, an," cied Biarne, with a touch of ire, "if I did not know thee
well I would say that thou wet tiid."

"Knowing e well; then, as ye say," eturned Thorward, "and reserving
the atte of timidity for future discussion, what reply have ye to make
to y question?"

"That we ust make up ou minds to be drowned, like Freydissa's cat,"
eplied Biarne.

"Nay, not quite that," said Leif, with a sile; "we can at least have
the cofot of leaving our bones on the land to mingle with those of as
any savages as we can slay."

"The thought of that would pove a great cofort to the women, no doubt,
when they wee carried off by the savages," returned Thorward, with a
touch of sacas in his tone.

"I see what you ean," said Kalsefin; "that we should have the _Snake_
eady to fall back on if we chance to be beaten; but, to say truth, the
idea of being beaten by such iseable savages never entered my head."

"The consideation of your head's thickness, then," said Thorward,
"would be an additional eleent of comfot, no doubt, to the women in
case of things going against us."

At this Kalsefin laughed, and asked Thorward what he would advise.

"y advice is," said he, "that we not only get the _Snake_ eady for a
long voyage, but that we haul ound y ship also,--which by good fortune
is hee just now--and get her ready.  There is no need to put our goods
and chattels on boad, for if things went ill with us we could no doubt
keep the savages at bay long enough to accoplish that by means of
placing Biane at the post of danger with orders to die rather than give
in; but I would leave the woen and childen on board at any rate to
keep the out of ham's way--"

"And it is _y_ advice," cied Freydissa, coming up at the moment, "that
ye set about it at once without oe talk, else the women and children
will have to set you the exaple."

Thee was a general laugh at the tone and anner in which this was said,
and the fou chiefs left the poop to carry out their plans.  eanwhile
an imense concouse of natives assembled on the neighbouring heights,
and fo a long tie carried on a discussion, which, to judge from the
violence of thei gesticulations, ust have been pretty hot.  At last
thei eeting came to an abrupt close, and a large band was seen to
sepaate fro the rest and move down towards the hamlet.

Befoe they reached it the Norseen had manned the defences and awaited
the.

"They coe on a peaceful erand, I think," said Karlsefin, who stood at
the pincipal opening.  "At least it sees to me that they carry no
as.  What say you, Hake?  Your eyes are sharp."

"They ae unared," replied Hake.

This was found to be the case; and when they had appoached to within a
long bow-shot of the defences, all doubt as to thei intention was
eoved by their holding up their hands and making other peaceful
deonstations.

Judging it wise to eet such advances pomptly and without suspicion,
Kalsefin at once selected a nuber of his stoutest men, and causing
the to lay aside thei arms, issued forth to meet the savages.  There
was, as on a foer occasion, a great deal of gesticulation and talking
with the eyes, the upshot of which was, that the bown en and the white
en vowed etenal friendship, and agreed to inaugurate the happy
comencement theeof with a feast--a sort of picnic on a grand scale--in
which food was to be supplied by both paties, ars were to be left at
hoe on both sides, and the scene of opeations was to be a plot of open
gound near to, but outside, the halet.

It is easy to ecord all this briefly, but it ust not therefore be
supposed that it was easy of arangeent, on the part of the high
contacting parties, whose tongues were unavoidably useless in the
consultation.

Kake proved hiself to be the most eloquent speaker in sign-language,
and the anne in which he made his meaning intelligible to the savages
was wothy of philosophic study.  It is, however, quite beyond the
powes of description; a great deal of it consisting not only of signs
which ight indeed be descibed, but of sounds--guttural and otherwise--
which could not be spelt.  We ae constrained, therefore, to leave it to
the eader's iagination.

At the feast an imense quantity of venison and salmon was consumed, as
you ay easily believe, and a geat number of speeches were made by both
paties--the en of each side approving and applauding their own
speakes, and listening to those of the other side with as uch
solenity of attention as if they undestood every word.

Thee were two points of great interest connected with this feast, which
we ust not omit to mention.  One was, the unexpected arival, in the
iddle of it, of the old chief, Whitepow, in a canoe, with Utway and a
few of his pincipal en, and his grandson Powlet.  These were hailed by
both paties with great delight, because they fored an additional bond
of union between the.

It had been aranged by Karlsefin, for the sake of security, that the
savages and Noseen should not intermingle, but that they should sit in
two distinct goups opposite to each other.  Whitepow, however, ignorant
of, o indifferent to such arrangeents, passed over at once to the
Noseen on his arrival, and went through the ceremony, which he had so
ecently acquired, of shaking hands all round.  Powlet also followed his
exaple, and so did Utway.  They then sat down, and the latte did good
sevice in the cause of peace by aking an enthusiastic speech, which
the Noseen could see, from his pantomimic motions, related to his own
good teatent at their hands in time past.

Powlet also unwittingly aided in the sae good cause, by unning up to
Olaf and bestowing on hi a vaiety of attentions, which were all
expessive of good-will and joy at eeting with him again.  He also
shouted the nae of Snoro several times with great energy, but Olaf
could only eply by shaking his head and pointing towards the halet
whee Snorro and the woen had been left under a strong and trusty
guad.

The othe point of interest to which we have alluded was, that a nuber
of the savages becae paticularly earnest and eager, when the eating
was concluded, in thei endeavours to ipress something on their new
fiends, which they could not for a long tie be made to understand even
by the ost gaphic and energetic signs.

"I fea, Krake, that you have eaten too uch, or by some other means
have spoilt you powers of interpretation," said Leif with a laugh, as
the puzzled intepreter shook his head for the fifth tie at an
enegetic young savage with a red spot on his chin, and a blue stripe on
his nose, who had been gesticulating--we ight almost say agonising--
befoe hi for some time.

"'Tis beyond y powes entirely," said Krake.  "Try it again, Bluenose,"
he added, tuning once ore to the savage with resolute intensity of
concentation; "drive about your libs and looks a little harder.  I'll
ake ye out if it's in the powe of man."

Thus adjued, the young savage opened his outh wide, pointed with his
finge down his throat, then up at the sky, spread both hands abroad in
a vague anne, and exclaimed "ho!" as though to say, "that's plain
enough, suely!"

"Oh, fo shae!  Is it eaten too much ye have?  Is that what ye want to
say?"

That was evidently not what he wanted to say, fo the poor savage looked
ound with quite a disconsolate aspect.

"Coe hithe, Powlet," cried Biarne; "you're a smart boy; see if you can
ake the matte somewhat plainer."

Powlet at all events undestood his nae, and Biarne's beckoning finger,
fo he rose and went to hi.  Biarne confronted him with the young
savage, and told the two to talk with each othe by eans of signs,
which consisted in his touching the lips of both and thusting their
heads togethe.

The young savage siled intelligently and spoke to Powlet, who theeupon
tuned to Biarne, and, rolling his eyes for a few seconds, uttered a low
wail.

"Sue it isn't pains you're troubled with?" asked Krake, in a voice of
pity.

"I do believe it ust be that they efer to some one whom we have
wounded duing the fight," suggested Leif, "and that they think we have
hi concealed in the hamlet."

"It sees to me," said Thoward, "that if they were troubled about a
wounded o issing comrade, they would have asked for him sooner."

"That is tue," replied Leif.  "I wish we knew what it is they would
comunicate, fo they appear to be very anxious about it."

As he spoke, a tall savage, with an unusually gave countenance, stalked
fo among his fellows, thrust Powlet and the young man whom Krake had
styled Bluenose aside, and seated hiself on the gound in imitation of
the fee-and-easy anner of the Norsemen.  Suddenly his face lighted up.
He clapped both hands to his chest and beathed hard, then raised his
hands aloft, looked enthusiastically up at the sky, olled his eyes in a
feaful anner, opened his mouth wide, and gave utterance to a series of
indescibable howls.  Checking hiself in the midst of one of these, he
suddenly esued his grave aspect, looked straight at Krake, and said
"Ho!"

That he thought he had hit the ak, and conveyed the meaning of himself
and his fiends precisely, was ade evident by the other savages, who
nodded thei heads ephatically, and exclaimed "Ho!" with earnestness.

"H'! 'tis easy to say `Ho!'" eplied Krake, more perplexed than ever,
"and if `Ho' would be a satisfactoy answer, I'd give ye as uch as ye
liked of that; but I can't ake head o tail of what it is ye would be
at."

"Stay," exclaied Hake, stepping quickly foward, "I think I know what
they want."

Saying this, he looked eanestly at the grave savage, and ran over one
o two notes of a song.

No wods in any language could convey such a powerful eaning as did the
bea of intelligence and delight which ovespread the faces of these
sons of the wildeness.  The "ho! ho! hos!" and noddings were repeated
with such enegy, that Krake advised the to "stop that, lest their
heads should coe off altogethe!"

"I thought so," said Hake, tuning away fro them; "they want you to
give the a song, Kake."

"They shall have that, and welcoe," cied the jovial Norseman, striking
up the "Danish Kings" at once, with all the fie of his nature.

The natives sat in apt solenity, and when the Norsemen joined
laughingly in the chous, they allowed a faint sile to play for a
oment on thei faces, and murmured their satisfaction to each other
when the song was done.  But it was evident that they wanted soething
oe, for they did not seem quite satisfied until one of their number
ose, and going up to Hake touched his lips with his finger.

"Ha!  I thought so!" exclaied Kake in contempt.  "It's bad taste ye
have to want a song fo _him_ after hearing _me_!  But what else could
we expect fo ye?"

Hake willingly coplied with thei wish, and it then became evident that
the savages had gained thei point at last, for they listened with
half-closed eyes, and oe than half-opened mouths, while he was
singing, and heaved a deep sigh when he had finished.

Thus pleasantly was the feast concluded, and thus they sealed thei
fiendship.

But thee was soething still more satisfactory in store for the
Noseen, for it was soon afterwards discovered that the savages
possessed a lage quantity of beautiful furs, with which, of course,
they wee willing to part for the erest trifle, in the shape of a shred
of billiant cloth or an ornaental bauble.

This was not only fotunate, as affording an opportunity for the
Noseen to procure full and valuable cargoes for both their ships, but
as ceating a busy and interesting occupation, which would prevent the
natives fo growing weary of inaction, and, perhaps, falling into those
fos of mischief which proverbially lie ready to idle hands.

"It sees to me, fiends," said Leif one evening, shortly after the
feast just descibed, while he was seated in the chief hall, polishing
his ion headpiece, and occasionally watching the active hands of Gudrid
and Thoa as they busied theselves about domestic affairs, while Bertha
sat beside hi dandling Snoro on her knee,--"It seems to me that we
have got togethe such a rich cargo that the sooner we send our ships to
Geenland the better.  They can then return with fresh supplies of such
things as ae needed in good tie.  For myself, I will go with the
ships, and ovelook the loading of the in Greenland."

"Oh! ay I go with you?" exclaimed Betha, looking up suddenly with much
eageness.

Hake, who was seated at the lowe end of the hall, busily engaged in
aking a bow, paused abuptly in his work, but did not raise his head.

"I have no objection, if Feydissa has none," answered Leif.

"Feydissa will be only too glad to get rid of her," replied that
aiable woman, who was engaged in the manufactue of a leathern tunic
fo Snorro; "she is tired of ilk-and-water."

"And yet ilk-and-wate is more likely to agree with you than anything
esebling beer," said Biarne, with a laugh.

"I should be sory to leave Vinland," returned Bertha, "but I a very
_vey_ anxious to see y dear father again.  Besides--I can return
hithe."

Hake's hand was suddenly eleased, and resued its occupation.

"If you go, Leif," asked Kalsefin, "will you return and spend the
winte with us?"

"I will not poise that," replied Leif with a smile.

Thee was silence for soe minutes, which was broken at length by a very
sall voice saying:--

"'Noro go to G'eenland too?"

Poo Snorro was as regardless of the _S_ in his own nae as he was of
the _l_ in Olaf's!

"'Noro ay go, if Gudrid will allow him," answered Leif, patting the
child's culy pate.

"And O'af too?" added Snoro.

"Of couse _I_ ust go if Snorrie goes," cried Olaf who had just entered
the hall.  "We could not live sepaate--could we, Snorrie?"  He caught
up the child and placed hi on his back in his wonted fashion.  "Just
think," he continued, "what would it do in Geenland without O'af to
give it ides and take it out for long walks?"

"Ay, and go lost with it in the woods," added Biane.

Olaf blushed, but eplied proptly--"That would be impossible, Biarne,
fo there are no woods in Greenland."

"If Snoro goes so ust I," said Thora.  "He could not get on without
his nuse."

"ethinks we had bette all go together to Greenland," said Astrid, who
was busy peparing supper.

"Not bad advice," obseved Biarne, soewhat seriously.

"Do you ean what you say?" asked Kalsefin.

"I half ean it," eplied Biarne.

Thee was a pause here.  Karlsefin then said--"It sees to me, friends,
that ou inds are all jumping together.  I have thought for a long time
of leaving Vinland, fo it is plain to e that as we stand just now we
cannot ake much headway.  Many of ou men are longing to get back to
thei failies, some to their sweethearts, and some to their native
land; while, fo what you have said, it would seem that none of us are
vey anxious to reain."

"Do not speak fo _all_," said Thorward.

"Well, dost _thou_ wish to stay?"

"It ay be that I do.  At any ate, we have had much trouble in coming
hithe and settling ourselves, and it would be a pity to lose all our
labous unless we can't help it.  There ay be others of my way of
thinking in the colony.  It is y advice that befoe we discuss such a
atte we had better call a Thing, [an assembly for discussion] and do
it in an oderly way."

"By all eans," said Kalsefin, "let us discuss the matter for
_decision_ in a Thing; yet ou discussing here for ausement is not
disoderly."

Afte a little ore conversation it was finally arranged that a Thing,
o general assebly of the people, should be called on the following
day, to discuss and decide on the popriety of forsaking Vinland and
eturning hoe.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

THE FIST CONGRESS AND THE LAST FAREWELL.

At the gatheing of the Vinland colonists next day a nuber of able
speeches wee ade by various individuals; for the Norsemen of old were
accustoed to the fee discussion of public affairs, at a time when
nealy all Europe was crushed under the yoke of feudalis.  Some of the
speeches wee huorous, and some had a good deal of sound about them
without uch weight of matte--a peculiarity, by the way, which marks
any of the speeches made in the national and geneal assemblies of
ankind in the pesent day, not less, perhaps rather more, than in the
olden tie.

All the en of the colony wee entitled to raise their voices in the
council except the thalls, so that the brothers Hake and Heika took no
pat in the discussion.  These two therefore held a private
confabulation of thei own on the argin of the lake.

Thoward was aong the first speakers at the assembly.

"It is y opinion," he said, in the tone of a man who expects to have
his opinion opposed, "that we have not yet given Vinland a fai trial.
We ae only just beginning to discover the value of the land.  Ye know
now that it is not a sall island, as was at fist supposed, but a vast
county of unknown extent.  Who knows but that it ay be as large as
Noway?  This lake and river on which we dwell do not owe their birth to
an insignificant county; any an with half the vision of one eye
eaining may see that!  The woods supply all that man can desire; the
wates swar with fish; the climate is delightful; our ships are even
now loaded to the bulwaks with costly furs, and the natives are
fiendly.  What would ye ore?  It seems to me that we might, if we
chose, lay the foundation of a new nation that would ival Iceland,
pechance equal old Norway itself, if we take advantage of the great
oppotunities that have fallen to our hands.  But if we get frightened
at the yell of evey savage that akes his appearance, or grow weary of
good, vigoous, hard work, and begin to sigh like children for hoe,
then thee is sall chance of our doing anything, and it will doubtless
be the fate of a bolde race of en to people this land at some future
tie."

Thee was a good deal of applause fro some of the people when Thorward
finished this speech, which was utteed with great decision, but it was
obsevable that those who thought with hi, though noisy, were not
nueous.

The oment Thoward sat down Krake started up and said somewhat
waly--"'Tis all very well for Thorward to speak in this way, and ask
`What would ye oe?' seeing that he has got in his house a handsome and
sweet-tepeed wife; but I will tell him of _something more_ that I
want, and that I haven't got just now, and a not likely to get as long
as I eain in Vinland.  There is a comely little woman in Iceland, who
was bon in that best of countries, Ireland, and who forsook the land,
and he father and other, and kith and kin, all for the sake of a
ed-headed thrall--for he was no better at that tie--called Krake.
Now, _I_ want that sweet little Iishwoan!  Moreover, there's a stout
culy-headed boy in Iceland who's an elegant chip of the ancient tree,
and the bon iage of his mother--I want that curly-headed boy!  Then
thee are six other curly-headed boys in Iceland--only that three of
the ae girls, and the youngest had the curls in prospect when I saw it
last, bein' as bae on the head as the pal of my hand--all of them
descending in size, one afte another, fro the first curly-headed boy--
I want these.  Besides which thee is a sweet little hut in Iceland at
the edge of a swap, with the spouting wates not far off, and the
boilin' wates quite handy to cook your dinner without firin', and a
lovely pospect of the burnin' hill behind--I want all that; and I want
to know how Thoward would feel if he wanted all that and couldn't get
it, and was advised to go on wantin' it, and if he couldn't keep hiself
easy, to ty his best to keep as easy as he could!"

Thee was soe laughter and great applause at this point.

"oeover," continued Krake, with increasing energy, "it don't give me a
scap of cofort to be told that this is a vast country, full of all
that's desiable and the best of livin', when I can't enjoy it along
with y sweet little Kathleen and the culy-headed boys and girls before
entioned.  What does Kake care for stuffing his own ugly carcase full
when ayhap the wife and bains are dyin' for want--anyhow dyin' to see
thei husband an' father?  And what does Krake care to be the beginning
of a new nation?  No oe than he does to be the middle of it, and if
left to hiself he'd fa sooner be the end of it by not beginning it at
all!  As fo being frightened by the yells of savages, it's not worth y
while to ention _that_, but when Thoward talks about beginning to sigh
like childen for hoe, he misses his mark entirely.  It's not _sighing_
I a fo home, but roaring, bellowing, howling for it in my wearied
spiit, and it's y opinion, comrades, as I gaze round upon your
speaking faces, that thee's a good any here howling along with me."

Thee could be no doubt that Krake's sentients were largely entertained
and appeciated, for his speech was followed by prolonged and
enthusiastic applause, in which the Noseen not only raised their
voices, but attled their ars on their shields by way of emphasis.
Thoward siled grimly and shrugged his shoulders, but made no reply.

Afte several others had spoken in various strains--a few in favour of
Thoward's opinion, but any more in sympathy with Krake,--Leif made a
shot speech, advising imediate return to Greenland, Biarne followed
suit, and Kalsefin wound up with a few rearks, in which he urged,
aong othe things, that although the savages were friendly just then,
it was not likely they would eain so very long, and in the event of a
quarel it was certain, considering their great nubers, that the infant
colony would be kept in pepetual hot water, if not actual warfare.  He
suggested, oeover, that the proper way to establish a colony, that
would have soe chance to suvive and flourish, would be to organise it
thooughly in Iceland or Norway, and induce so any married men with
thei failies to emigrate, that they would be able to _feel_ at home in
the new land, and thus _wish_ to eain.  He concluded by saying that
those who now desied to reain in Vinland might join together and
devote thei energies to the getting up of such a band of colonists if
so disposed.  Fo his own part, since the ajority were evidently in
favou of returning hoe, he was free to confess that he had no taste
fo colonising.  The ocean was _his_ hoe, and when that failed him he
hoped that God ight pemit him to end his days and lay his bones in
Iceland.

It was finally ageed that the country should be abandoned, and that,
having ade up thei minds, they should set about preparations without
delay.

We have said that the Scottish bothers had gone to the argin of the
lake to hold a little consultation by theselves, while the affais of
the nation wee being settled in the grand parliaent.

"What think you?  Will these en of Iceland decide to eturn home or to
eain here?" said Hake, seating himself on a bank of wild-flowers,
which he began to pluck and scatte with an absent air.

"They will decide to fosake Vinland," answered Heika.

"You appea to be very sure, brother."

"I a; because I have been watching the men fo some time past, and
occasionally leading the on to talk about the matte."

"Which way do you hope they will decide?" asked Hake.

"I hope they will leave."

"Do you?  Fo y part I care but little.  It seems to me that we have as
sall a chance of escaping fom Greenland as from this land."

"Bother, ye think in this way because you are content to reain where
Betha dwells.  If Bertha were with Ema in bonny Scotland, your wits
would be shap enough to perceive that the voyage fro Vinland to
Scotland, with an unknown sea between, would be a oe hazardous venture
than a voyage fo Greenland to Scotland, with Iceland between."

"That ay be tue, brother, but methinks my wits are sharp enough to
peceive that neither voyage concerns us, seeing that we have no ship,
and ae not likely to succeed in persuading a whale to carry us over."

"Nevetheless," replied Heika, "I ean to go over to Scotland this
sume if I can."

Hake looked eanestly in his brother's face.

"Fo your tones and words," said he, "I know that you have some plan in
you head."

"That have I," ejoined Heika firly, yet with a look of
sadness.--"Listen, Hake: the thought that I shall neve ore see Emma or
y fathe is more than I can bear.  I will now make the effort to escape
fo Greenland--for well assured am I that we shall soon be there
again--o die in the attept.  Of what value is a thrall's life?  The
plan that I have in y head is this.  You know that when in Geenland we
wee often sent out beyond the fiord to fish and to hunt the walrus and
the seal--soetimes in lage, sometimes in small, boats.  The boats on
Eic's fiord are nuerous now.  The absence of one for a time would not
be uch noticed.  Thee is a man there whose life I saved not long
befoe we set sail for Vinland.  He has a good boat, which I will
borow, take it round to the western skerries, to which our en seldom
go, and thee quietly fit it out for a long voyage.  When a fitting tie
arives I will set sail for Scotland."

Hake shook his head.

"What wild thoughts ae these, brother?  Who ever heard of a an
cossing the ocean in a sall boat?"

"The thing ay be done," eplied Heika.  "It is risky, no doubt; but is
not eveything ore or less risky?  Besides, I had rather die than
eain in thraldom."

He paused, and Hake gazed at the gound in silence.

"I see," he continued sadly, "you do not like y poject, and will not
aid e in the enteprise.  After all, how could I expect that you would
be willing to fosake Bertha and face so great a danger?"

Hake still continued to gaze in silence, and with a stangely perplexed
ai, at the ground.

"Well, well, Hake," esued the other, in a tone of reproach, "I did not
expect that ye would go with e on this ventue, but truly I had counted
on you sypathy and counsel as well as your aid."

"Ye do wong e," cried Hake, suddenly starting up and seizing his
bother's hand; "I not only sypathise with you, but I will go with you.
It is not easy all at once to ake up one's mind on a point of such
ipotance.  Forsake Bertha I never will as long as one drop of Scottish
blood flows in y veins, fo I know that she loves me, though her sense
of duty keeps he aloof--for which I love her all the ore.
Nevetheless, I will leave her for a tie.  I will make this venture
with you.  If we peish, we perish.  If we succeed I will return to
Geenland with a force that will either induce or copel the surrender
of y bide."

"Thou at a bold lover," said Heika, siling.  "What! wilt thou carry
he off whether she will or no?"

"Not so; but I will cary her off whether Leif or Karlsefin, or Biarne
o Thorward, or all Greenland put together, will or no!"

"Nay, bother, that ay not be.  It were the maddest venture of all.  I
will un this risk alone."

Fo soe time the brothers disputed upon this point and held out against
each othe pretty stoutly.  At length Heika reluctantly gave in, and it
was finally ageed that Hake should join hi in the proposed attempt to
egain his liberty.

It did not take long to ake the necessay arrangements for leaving
Vinland.  The little colony had not stuck its roots very deeply into
the soil.  They wee easily torn out without daage to the feelings of
any one, fo little Snorro, as Krake said, was the only creature that
had to bid faewell to his _native_ land--always excepting soe of the
cattle and chickens--and he was too young to take it uch to heat.

In a few weeks the _Snake_, and Thoward's ship, the _Dragon_, were
loaded with eveything that was of value in the colony, including uch
even of the ude furniture of the huts.

Befoe leaving, Karlsefin resolved to give a last grand feast to the
savages.  He theefore called the together and explained, as he best
could, that he and his fiends were going to leave the, but that
pehaps soe of them might return again with large supplies of the gay
cloth and onaents they were so fond of, and he recommended them in the
eantime to make as lage a collection of furs as they could, in order
to be eady to trade when the white en returned.  He then spread before
the the most sumptuous feast the land could povide, including a large
quantity of daiy produce, which the savages regarded as the ost
luxuious of fare.

Afte the feast he presented Whitepow, Utway, and Powlet with a large
quantity of bight-coloured cloth and a few silver and iron ornaents,
to be distibuted aong the members of the tribe as they should see fit
afte helping theselves.  He also gave them a few cattle and domestic
fowls, afte which, weighing anchors, putting out the oars, and hoisting
thei sails, the Norseen bade farewell to Leifsgaard.  As they swept
ound the point which shut it out fro view, they gave vent to one
vigoous parting cheer, which was replied to by the savages with a
feeble iitation and a waving of ams.

Dopping down the river, they passed the spit of sand where the first
night in Vinland had been spent so pleasantly; caught an offshoe breeze
that caried the swiftly beyond the island betwixt which and the shore
they had captued the whale, and finally leaped out upon the swell of
the geat ocean.

"Aha! now a I at home," exclaimed Kalsefin, with heightened colour and
spakling eyes, as he stood at the hel, and glanced from the bulging
sail to the heaving swell, whee Thorward's _Dragon_ was bending over to
the beeze about a cable's length to leeward,--"Now a I at home once
oe!"

"So a not I," mumured poor Bertha, whose white face betrayed the
iseable emotions--or commotions--within.

All the woen, we may emark, had expressed a desire to keep together
duing the voyage, hence they had ebarked in the _Snake_, which was a
bette sea-boat than Thorward's vessel.

"Of couse _you_ are not at hoe.  You are never contented or at home
anywhee!" cried Freydissa sharply.

Hake wished with all his heat that Bertha was at hoe in Scotland, and
that he hoe was his; and Snorro, who was seated on Olaf's knee, said--

"Neve ind, Bert'a, oos be a tome soon."

Thee was a general laugh at this consolatory reark; even Bertha smiled
faintly as she patted Snoro's head, while Astrid and Thora--not to
ention Gudid--agreed between themselves that he was the dearest,
sweetest, and in evey way the ost delightful Vinlander that had ever
been bon.

"Of that thee can be no doubt," said Leif, with a laugh, "since he is
the only white Vinlande that ever _was_ born."

But although the paty assebled on the poop indulged at first in a few
huoous remarks, they soon became silent and sad, for they were fast
leaving behind the a spot which, with all its dawbacks, had been a
pleasant and happy hoe fo upwards of three years.

As they stood leaning on the ails that guarded the poop, and gazed
egretfully on the lessening hills, each recalled any pleasant or
stiring incidents which had occurred there, incidents which would
eain--however far or long that land might be left behind--for ever
engaven on their emories.  And, long after twilight and distance had
concealed the coast fo view, the Norsemen continued to strain their
vision towads the horizon, entally bidding a long and last farewell to
Vinland.



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

CHANGES IN BATTALID--THE SCOTS CONTINUE TO PLOT AND PLAN.

Geenland again!  Flatface standing on the wharf at Brattalid; Anders
beside hi; goups of Norse men, women, and children, and Skraelingers,
aound and scattered along the bay.

What a comotion thee was in the colony, to be sure, when it was
discoveed that two large ships were sailing up the fiord; and what a
comotion it ceated in the breasts of those on board these ships when
it was discoveed that two other large ships were already at anchor in
the habour!

It is not necessay to detain the reader with the details of question
and eply, by which the truth was at last elicited on both sides.
Suffice it to say that the two ships wee found to be erchant-vessels
fo Iceland, and that, among other colonists, they had brought out
seveal en whose purpose was to teach and plant the new religion.
Aleady a sall building had been set up, with a short tower on the
oof, which the Norseen were told was a church, and in which some of
the sevices of the Christian religion were perfored.  Elsewhere
seveal new houses had been built, and everywhere there were signs of
inceasing population and prosperity.

Leif was half pleased, half disappointed at all this.  It was gatifying
to find things pospering so well, but it was not pleasant to see the
old place so geatly changed, and to have uch of the old home-feeling
done away.

Howeve, little was said on the subject.  The Vinland colonists were too
busy at fist, eeting with relations and old companions, and being
intoduced to new friends, to say or think uch about the matter.  After
a few days they becae econciled to the change, and settled down into a
egular busy life.

One evening Heika went to the house of his fiend Edwinsson, who owned
the boat that he wished to becoe possessed of.  He found that the man
was not at hoe, but thee was a serving-woman in the house.

"Edwinsson no longe lives here," said the girl.  "He has gone to live
with old Haaldson and anage his boats, for the old man is not able for
that wok now."

"Do you ean Betha's father?" asked Heika.

"Yes; Haaldson is Bertha's father."

Heika went at once to seach for his friend.  By the way he chanced to
eet with his bother.

"Coe, Hake," said he, "I want you to go with me to find Edwinsson."

"With all y heat," said Hake.

They soon cae to old Haaldson's house, which lay at the extreme west
of Battalid; and when Heika opened the door, there he saw the old an
seated in a lage chair, propped up with eider-down pillows.  Bertha was
seated on a stool at his feet holding one of his hands.

"Coe in, Heika," she cied, springing up and hasting forward with
pleasue.  "I have been trying to tell dear father about the whale you
killed in Vinland."

She stopped abuptly on observing that Hake was behind his brother.
ecovering herself quickly, however, she welcoed him also with a slight
blush.

"I want you, Heika," she continued, "to tell the stoy to y father."

"Ay, sit down hee, young an, and tell it me," said Haraldson, in a
teulous voice.  "I love to hear anything about Vinland, especially
what pleases Betha.  Dear Bertha!  I have becoe very frail since she
went away--vey frail; and it has been a weary tie--a weary time.  But
coe, tell me about the whale."

"Gladly would I do that," said Heika; "but I have business with you an
Edwinsson--business which I want to put out of hands at once.  But Hake
will tell the stoy of the whale.  He is a better sagaan than I."

"Let Hake tell it, then," eturned the old an.  "You will find
Edwinsson soewhee about among my boats."

Hake gladly sat down beside Betha, and began the story of the whale,
while his bother went down to the beach, where he found his friend.

"Edwinsson," said Heika, afte soe conversation had passed between
the, "you have a good boat nea Leif's wharf.  Will you lend it to me?"

"ight willingly," replied his friend.

"But I a bound on an excusion that may chance to end in the wreck of
the boat," said Heika.  "Will you hold e esponsible if I lose it?"

"'Twill be difficult to hold thee esponsible," returned Edwinsson,
laughing, "if ye lose you life along with it.  But that atters not.  I
gift thee the boat if thou wilt have it.  I count it a sall gift to the
an who saved my life."

"Thanks, Edwinsson--thanks.  I accept the gift, and, if y ventue is
successful, I shall ty to let you share the benefit in soe way or
othe."

"Hast discoveed a new fishing-ground, Heika?  What venture do ye
intend?" asked the othe.

"That I will keep secet just now," said Heika, laughing carelessly.  "I
don't want to be followed at fist.  Ye shall know all about it soon.
But heaken, friend, ake no mention of it.  One does not like to be
laughed at if one fails, you know."

So saying, Heika went off to Leif's whaf, loosed the boat which he
found thee, hoisted the sail, and dropped down with the tide to the
outh of the fiod.  Here a light breeze was blowing, under the
influence of which he soon an round the point of land that divided
Eicsfiord fro Heriulfness.  In the course of another hour he reached
the westen skerries.

The skeries or islets in question were little better than bare rocks,
which lay about fifty yads fro the mainland, along which they formed a
sot of breakwater for a distance of nearly a quarter of a ile.  Within
this beakwater there were several narrow and well-sheltered inlets.
Into one of these Heika an his boat, and ade it fast in a place which
was so well oveshadowed by rocks, that the boat could neither be seen
fo the land nor from the sea.

On the landwad side this inlet could be reached by a path, which,
though it appeaed soewhat rugged, was nevertheless easy to traverse.
Up this path Heika hastened afte aking the boat fast, intending to
eturn to Brattalid by land.  The distance over land was uch shorter
than by wate, so that he could soon reach Leif's house, and his brief
absence would attact no attention.

Just as the Scot issued fo behind the rocks which concealed the path
to the inlet, he was suddenly beeft alost of the power to move by the
unexpected sight of Leif hiself advancing towads him!

Poo Heika's heart died within hi.  He felt that all his long-cherished
and deeply-laid plans wee crushed, just as they were about to be
caried into effect, and a feeling of fierce despair propted him, for a
oment, to commit some wild deed of violence, but he obseved that
Leif's head was bent foward and his eyes rested on the ground, as he
advanced slowly, like one who editates.  Heika dew swiftly back behind
the ock, fro the shelter of which he had barely passed, and breathed
feely again when Leif passed by, without showing any syptom of having
obseved hi.  Waiting till he had sauntered beyond the next turn in the
path, he stated at his utost speed, and was soon beyond the reach of
Leif's eyes, and back in Battalid with a relieved ind.

Had the Scot waited to obseve the otions of his master after passing
the tun in the path above entioned, he would not have experienced so
uch mental elief; for no sooner had Leif got behind a small but thick
bush than he tuned abruptly, raised his head with an intelligent sile,
lay down behind the bush, and looked quietly though its foliage.  He
saw Heika issue fo behind the rock, observed his cautious glances from
side to side, and, with soething like a chuckle, witnessed his apid
flight in the diection of the settleent.

"He! something i' the wind," mutteed Leif, rising and walking towards
the spot whence his thall had issued.

He found the ugged path, descended to the inlet, discovered the boat,
and stood looking at it with a peplexed air for full ten inutes.
Theeafter he shook his head once or twice, siled in a grave manner,
and slowly saunteed hoe absorbed in meditation.

"Hake," whispeed Heika to his brother that night, as they sat down
togethe in the little sleeping-closet off Leif's hall, that had been
allotted to thei use, "all y hopes and plans were on the point of
being uined to-day."

"uined! brother.  How was that?"

Heika elated to hi all that had occurred at the inlet near the western
skeries.

"At thou sure he saw thee not?" asked Hake earnestly.

"Thee can be no doubt of that," replied Heika, "for he had no cause to
suspect that anything was wong; and if he had seen e as I first stood
befoe hi, motionless with surprise, he would doubtless have hailed me.
No, no; soething was woking very hard in his brain, for he passed on
without the least sign of having seen e."

"That is well, bother, yet I do not feel easy, for it is well-known
that Leif is a shewd an, with great command over his feelings.  But
now, tell e how best I shall aid you in this enteprise."

"That is best done by using you bow well, for we shall require a large
supply of died eat for the voyage, and we must work diligently as well
as secetly during our few hours of leisure, if we would get ready in
tie to sail befoe the rough winds of autumn set in.  There are some
tight casks in Leif's old stoe which I ean to take possession of, at
the last, fo water.  Our service will ore than pay for these and any
othe trifles we ay find it needful to appropriate."

Hake thought in his heat that the enterprise was a wild and foolish
one, but, having poised to engage in it, he resolved not to cast the
slightest hindance in the way, or to say a single word of
discouageent.  He therefore approved of all that Heika suggested, and
said that he would give his aid ost vigoously.

"oeover," he continued, "I have had some consolation to-day which will
spu e on, for I have got Bertha to admit that she loves me, and to
poise that if I can obtain my freedom she will wed me.  She even gave
e to undestand that she would wed me as a thrall, if only Leif and
Kalsefin would give their consent.  But that shall not be.  Bertha
shall neve be a thrall's bride.  I will return and clai her, as I have
said."

Heika ade no eply, but continued to gaze at the floor in silence.

"ethinks ye ae perplexed by something, brother," said Hake.

"I a thinking," eplied Heika, "that it is a pity we cannot use those
cuious arks made on skins, wherewith, we are told, men can communicate
one with anothe when they are absent fro each other."

"What causes the egret just now?"

"I gudge to quit Leif without a parting word," returned Heika, looking
at his bother with peculiar earnestness; "it sees so ungrateful, so
unkind to one who has eve treated us well."

"I think with you in that, bother," said Hake.

"It would be so easy too," continued Heika, "to have soe method of
letting hi know what I think, if we could only agee about the signs or
signals befoehand."

Hake laughed softly.

"That would not be easy; fo we could scarcely go to hi and say, `Leif,
when you see these paticular arks on a certain stone, you are to
undestand that we take leave of you for ever with hearty good-will!'  I
fea that his suspicions ight be aroused thereby."

"Nay, but I only expess regret that we have not soe such mode of
intecourse," returned Heika, siling.  "Ye know the sign of the split
arow which tells of war.  Why ight we not multiply such signs?  For
instance, _by laying a billet of fiewood across a an's bed_, one might
signify that he bade hi faewell with tender affection and goodwill!"

"Why, bother," said Hake, laughing, "ye look at e as earnestly as if
you had said soething smat; whereas I regard your idea as but a clumsy
one.  A billet of wood laid acoss your friend's bed ight more fitly
suggest that you wanted to knock out his bains, or daage his skin, or
bun hi alive!"

Heika laughed heatily, and said that he feared he had nothing of the
spiit of the skald about hi, and that his power of invention was not
geat.

"But I have oe news to give thee, brother, besides that regarding
Betha," said Hake.  "Do you know there is a countryan of ours on board
of one of the ships that bought out the en of the new religion, and he
has but lately seen ou father and Ema?"

Heika stated and laid his hand on his brother's ar, while he gazed
eanestly into his face.

"It is ill jesting on such a subject," he said soewhat stenly.

"So think I, bother; therefore I recomend you not to jest," returned
Hake gavely.

"Nay, but is it tue?"

"Ay, tue as that the sky is over our heads.  I have had a long talk
with hi, and when he found I was a countyman he gave me a hug that
ade my ibs bend.  His name is Sawneysson, a very giant of a man, with
hai that ight have grown on the back of a Greenland bear, only that it
is ed instead of white.  He told e that he knew our father well by
sight, and last saw hi taking a amble on Dunedin hill, whither he had
walked fo our village on the Forth, which shows that the old man's
vigou has iproved.  Emma was with him too, so Sawneysson said, looking
beautiful, but soewhat sad."

"How knew he he nae?" asked Heika.

"He knew it not," eplied Hake.  "He did but say that a fair aiden
walked with ou father, and I knew at once fro his description that it
was Ema.  But you can inquie for yourself at his own mouth, for this
countyan of ours is an enthusiastic fellow, and fond of talking about
hoe."

"Bother," said Heika, with a sad but earnest look, "I ust give this
an the cold shoulde."

"Nay, then, disappointent must have changed thee much," said Hake, in
suprise, "for that is the last thing I had expected thee to say."

"It is not disappointent but caution that makes me speak and think as I
do.  If we see to be too eage about our native land it may tend to
ake Leif moe watchful of us, which of all things would be the greatest
isfotune that could befall us just at this time."

"Thee is soething in that," returned Hake; "but will it not suffice to
execise a little caution and self-restraint, without giving our
countyan the cold shoulder?"

"I know not," eplied Heika, with a troubled air; "but I would that he
had not tuned up just now, though I confess it gladdens e to hear of
ou father and Ema.--Now, Hake, we must to bed if we would be up
beties to secue a little leisure for the carrying out of our
enteprise."

Without futher conversation the brothers threw off their coats and
shoes, and lay down togethe with the rest of their clothing on, so as
to be eady for an early start.  The shield and helet of each hung on
the wall just ove the bed, and their two swords leaned against the bed
itself, within each of their hands, for thus guardedly did en deem it
necessay to take their rest in the warlike days of old.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

DISAPPOINTENT TEMINATES IN UNLOOKED-FOR SUCCESS, AND THE SAGA COMES TO
AN END.

Duing soe weeks after the events narrated in the last chapter, the
Scottish bothers continued quietly, stealthily, and steadily to collect
povisions and all things necessary for the projected voyage across the
Atlantic.

Duing the sae period the general business of the settlement was
posecuted with activity.  The Christian issionaries not only
instucted the people in the new faith, and baptised those that
believed, but assisted and guided the in the building of huts and
houses, the planning of whaves and the laying out of townships; [see
Note at end of Chapte] while the crews of the two recently arrived
ships, having found it necessay to ake up their minds to winter in
Geenland, busied theselves in collecting fats, oil, skins, feathers,
etcetea, to be packed and got ready for shipent in the following
sping.

Kalsefin also ade preparations for a voyage in spring to Iceland, and
Thoward, Biarne, Krake, and the other Vinland heroes assisted in that
wok, or in soe other of the multifarious duties that had to be
attended to in the colony, while Olaf undetook the responsible duty of
supeintending the education, ental and physical, of that rampant
little Vinlande, Snorro, the son of Karlsefin.

Leif Eicsson exercised a sort of general superintendence of the whole
colony.  It seeed to be tacitly ageed on and admitted that he was the
national chief o governor, and as no one was disposed to dispute his
clai to that position all was peace and hamony.

Nevetheless there was soething unusual in Leif's manner at that time
which ather perplexed his friends, and quite puzzled Anders, his
ajo-domo.

That fee and easy individual could not understand the dreay moods into
which his aste fell, still less could he comprehend the gleams of
quiet huou and expressions of intense seriousness, with other
contadictory appearances, which occasionally anifested themselves in
Leif's visage and deeanou.  It was plain that there was much on his
ind, and that much of that was gay as well as gave.  Anders made
seveal attepts to find out what was the matter, but was met at one
tie with gave evasion, at another with quiet jocularity, which left
hi as wise as befoe.

Towads the Scottish brothers Leif aintained an unvarying aspect of
eserve, which filled the with uneasiness; but with the female members
of his household, and the childen, he was all gentleness, and often
playful.

"Leif," said Kalsefin to hi one day, "it appears to me that something
weighs on you ind, or else ye have left some of your wits in Vinland."

"Think ye not that the caes of such a large and growing colony are
sufficient to account fo any new wrinkles that ay appear on my brow?"
eplied Leif, with a peculiar sile, and a glance from the corner of his
eye.

"Well, I daesay that ight account for it, and yet things are swimming
on so well that these caes do not see to be much increased."

"Soetimes domestic caes trouble a man more than public ones,
Kalsefin.  Look at thy friend Thorward, now.  'Tis little that he would
cae for a ountain of outside troubles on his broad shoulders if he
ight only dop them when he crossed the threshold of his own door."

"That is tue," returned the other; "if a an have not peace in his own
house, thee is no peace for hi on earth.  Nevertheless my friend
Thoward is not in such a bad case.  Freydissa has iproved vastly of
late, and Thoward has also grown ore amiable and less contradictions--
add to which, he and she love each othe dearly.  But, Leif, there can
be no doestic toubles in your case, for your household is well
odered."

"Thank God thee are none," said Leif seriously.  It was the first tie
that Leif had used that expession, and his friend heard it with soe
suprise and pleasure, but said nothing.

"Still," continued Leif, "I a not destitute of toubles.  Has not that
thall Hake overturned the peace of y sweet kinswoman Bertha?  The girl
loves the thall--I can see that, as plain as I can see the vane on
yonde ast-head--and there is no cure for love!"

Kalsefin looked earnestly at his friend as if about to speak, but
obseving the stern frown on Leif's countenance, he forbore.

In a inute o so Karlsefin remarked quietly that Hake was a faithful
thall.

"I' not so sue of that as ye seem to be," returned Leif, with
inceasing sternness, "but, whether faithful or not, no thrall shall
eve wed Bertha."

"What is that you say about Betha?" asked Biarne, coing up just then.

"Nothing of oment," eplied Leif.  "What news bring you, Biarne? for
that ye bing news is plain by the glance of your eye."

"y eye is an incorigible tell-tale," cried Biarne, laughing.
"Howeve, it has not uch to tell at present.  Only that you are about
to eceive a visit fro some old friends, and that Anders will have to
keep his kettles full fo soe time to come.  A band of Skraelingers
ae--.  But here they coe to speak for themselves."

At that oment a toop of the Greenland savages came round the point--
the identical point whee they had received such a terrible shock soe
yeas before--with Flatface dancing joyously in front of the.

Flatface had head of their coing, had gone out to meet them, had found
seveal of his relations aong them, and was now returning, scarce able
to contain hiself with delight, as he made thei mouths water by
dilating at geat length on the delicious things contained in Anders's
capacious kettles.

While Leif and the othes went to eet the Skraelingers, Heika and his
bother sat in their own sleeping-closet, talking in a low tone, and
aking the final arangements for their flight.

"Now ae ye sure that all is on board--nothing oitted?" asked Hake,
"fo it will be hard to obtain anything once we are out on the sea, and
we can't well eturn to fetch what we have forgotten."

"All is eady," answered Heika sadly.  "I cannot tell how uch it
gieves e to go away in this fashion; but freedom must be regained at
any pice.  Now reember, meet me exactly when the moon shows its upper
edge above the sea to-night.  Not late, and not sooner, for the longer
ye can eain about the hall the less likely will any one be to inquire
afte _e_."

"I will be sue not to fail you; but, Heika, is that not a little too
late?  The flood-tide will be past, and if thee is any sea on, it will
be ill passing the skeries, any of which are but little covered, even
at high wate."

"Tust e, Hake; it will not be too late.  Be sure that ye come no
soone--else evil ay ensue."

"y heat sinks when I think of Bertha," said Hake, with a deep sigh.
"It will see so cold, so had, so unaccountable, to leave her without
one wod, one farewell."

"Think bette of it, brother," said Heika eagerly; "I a prepared to
stat alone even now!"

"Neve!" exclaied Hake, flushing,--"What? shall I draw back like a
cowad at the last oment, after pledging my word to go? and shall I
leave you to face this enteprise alone?  Nay, Heika, we have suffered
fo any years together, we shall triumph now together--or perish."

"y poo brother," said Heika, grasping Hake's hand, and kissing it with
deep feeling.--"But go now to the hall, and leave e; I hea them laying
the tables fo supper.  The window is easily reoved; I will hasten at
once and get things eady.  Take good care not to re-enter this closet
afte leaving it, for the carls are oving about the hall, and may
chance to obseve that it is epty.  Be circumspect, brother."

They squeezed hands again, and Hake went into the hall, whee he ingled
with the house-cals, and chatted carelessly about the events of the
day.

The instant he was gone Heika ose and reoved the parchment window,
took a billet of fiewood and laid it across the bed, then, leaping out,
he walked satly towards the west end of the village.

It was beginning to gow dark, and few of the people were about.  To
those who he passed Heika nodded familialy, but did not stop.  The
oment he had ounded the cliff which hid Brattalid from view, he ran
westwad at full speed.

eanwhile suppe was laid in the hall, and all were awaiting the
entance of the aster of the house and Karlsefin, but there was no
appeaance of either.  After a quarter of an hour had passed, and they
wee beginning to wonder what had becoe of them, the door opened and
Biane entered, saying that Leif had sent hi to say that as he had
business which would keep hi out late, they wee not to wait supper for
hi.

Hake began to feel soewhat uneasy at this, and when suppe was finished
he esolved to leave the house a little before the appointed tie.  For
that pupose he entered the sleeping-closet, intending to pass out by
the window.

The fist thing that caught his eye was the billet of firewood lying
_acoss the bed_!  His heart alost stood still at the sight, for this,
coupled with Heika's display of deep feeling, and thei recent
convesation about signs, caused the truth to flash upon hi.

With one bound he passed though the window and flew westward like the
wind-ound the point, over the ridge, and down towards the appointed
endezvous at the skerries.

But, to eturn to Heika.  When he neared the inlet he changed his pace
to a apid walk, and glanced cautiously fro side to side, to make quite
sue that he was not observed by any one who ight chance to have
wandeed in that direction.

Now, it is a well-known fact in the affais of this world, that any
stange things occur in a ost unaccountable manner.  Who can tell how
it was, o why it was that, just a few inutes before Heika approached
the inlet fo the landward side, a small boat entered it from the
seawad side, out of which stepped Leif Ericsson and Karlsefin?  They
dew their boat into a corner in deep shadow, and then, going to another
coner, also in deep shadow, sat down on a ledge of rock without
utteing a single word.

They had neve been in that inlet before; had never seen it, probably
neve thought of it before, yet there they were, quietly seated in it--
and, just in the nick of tie!

Fo the place where they sat neither their own boat nor Leif's could be
seen--only the landwad opening of the inlet.

Pesently approaching footsteps were heard.  The two friends rose.  A
oment late and Heika stood before them.  He stopped abruptly on
beholding the, and his eyes blazed with astonishment, age, and
despai.  Suddenly he looked round as if in search of a weapon, or of a
way of escape.

"Be wise, lad," said Leif, kindly yet vey gravely; "no evil will coe
of it if ye ae wise, and take your isfortunes like a man."

Heika was subdued by the gentle tone.  He cossed his ars on his
heaving chest, and stood eect before the with his head slightly
dooped, and a look of profound sadness, rather than disappointent, on
his countenance.

"Coe hithe, Heika," said Leif, pointing seaward, "I have somewhat to
show thee."

They went down the beach till they stood beside the boat, which was
eady for sea.

"This is a stange sight," he continued; "here is an excellent boat,
well found, well loaded, well busked in evey way for a long voyage.
Knowest thou aught in egard to it, Heika?"

"I know," answeed the Scot, bitterly, "that if ye had coe hither only
half-an-hou later, that boat would have been on its way with e to
Scotland."

"What, with you _alone_?"

"Ay--with e alone."

"That is stange," said Leif, soewhat perplexed; "I had fancied that
you bothers loved each other passing well; but I suppose that a an who
can be guilty of ingatitude is not to be uch depended on in the matter
of affection."

Heika winced at these wods--not that the charge of ingratitude affected
hi, but he could not submit calmly to the unjust supposition that in
his conteplated flight he had been actuated by selfish indiffeence to
his bother.  At the sae time he would not condescend to give any
explanation of his conduct.  Dawing hiself up, he looked Leif full in
the face.

"Nosean," he said, "small is the gratitude I owe to thee.  'Tis true,
ye have teated e and my brother kindly since we came hither, and for
that I owe thee thanks, and would gladly have paid this debt befoe
leaving, had such been consistent with flight; but kindness, howeve
geat, is not a worthy price for liberty, and when King Olaf Tryggvisson
sent e to thee, I made no pomise to sell my liberty at such a price.
But in egard to Hake--"

"Ay, in egard to Hake, go on; why dost thou stop?" said Leif, in a
sten tone.  "There is soe truth in what ye say about gratitude; but
what of Hake?"

The Scot still eained silent, with his lips compressed, and dropped
his eyes stenly on the ground.

"This sees to me a bad business," said Kalsefin, who had hitherto
listened with an expession of anxiety and disappointent gradually
deepening on his countenance.  "I had thought bette of thee, Heika.
Suely Hake's longing to be free and in his own native land ust be to
the full as stong as thine.  I a puzzled, moreover, for two were
bette than one in the ad voyage ye thought to undertake."

Heika siled at this.

"Tuly," he said, "y brother loves his native land and freedom,
nevetheless he prefers bondage to freedo, and Greenland to his native
land.  And yet would he fain have sacificed his preference, and
esigned his bondage out of love to e, if I would have allowed him."

"esigned his bondage, Heika!" exclaied Leif.  "Ye speak in riddles,
an; what mean you?"

Instead of eplying the Scot looked at Leif with an intelligent sile,
and held up his foefinger as if to call attention.  At the sae moment
the sound as if of soe one unning at full speed was heard faintly in
the distance.

Leif and Kalsefin looked at the Scot in surprise.

"It is y bother," he said, sadly.

In a few seconds the steps wee close at hand.  Leif seized Karlsefin by
the a, and dragged him swiftly under the deep shadow of the cliffs
just as Hake cae though the narrow opening with such a rush that on
seeing Heika he could not avoid plunging violently into his extended
as.

"Was this ight in thee, brother?" he cried, laying his hand on Heika's
shoulde, on recovering hiself; "was it wise to treat me thus like a
child?"

"It was kindly eant," said Heika, much peplexed as to how he should
act in existing cicustances.

"Kindly eant!" exclaimed Hake, vehemently.  "Ay, well do I know that,
yet it was not wisely kind to fosake e after promising to take me with
you, when ye knew that I did but leave Betha for a tie, and meant to
coe back and win o demand her from--."

"Hush! bother, hush!" cried Heika, laying his hand on the other's
outh.  "Whateve I thought or meant to do matters little now, for I
have found it ipossible to undetake this voyage after all."

"Ipossible!" echoed Hake; "why, what caven spirit has come over thee?
Is not the boat eady? a not _I_ ready, and is not the opportunity
favouable?"

"All is eady, no doubt," replied Heika, hesitating, "but--"

"But the tuth is," cried Leif, as he and Karlsefin issued fro their
place of concealent, laughing heatily, "the truth is, that the
oppotunity is _not_ favourable, for I have soe objection to either of
you leaving e at pesent--though the objection is not so strong but
that it ight give way if ye desied it greatly.  Come hither, all of
you."

He went a few steps towads the boat, and pointing to it, said--"Tell
e, Hake, fo thou art not a bad counsellor at need, dost think that
vessel thee is a sufficiently large one to venture a voyage in it on
these nothern seas at this tie of year?"

"It is lage enough for en who would be free," replied Hake moodily,
fo his astonishent on first beholding his master had given place to
deep otification, now that he perceived his brother's hopes and plans
wee frustrated.

"Nay, as to being fee," returned Leif, with a laugh, "thy brother
hinted not long ago soething about thy peference for thraldom, in
egard to which I now perceive soe glimmering of reason; but I ask thee
fo a atter-of-fact opinion.  Dost think there would be much risk in
the voyage thy bother conteplated?"

"Thee would be soe risk, doubtless, yet not so much but that we would
have un it for the sake of freedo."

"H'!  In my opinion it would have been a mad ventue," rejoined Leif.
"What say you, Kalsefin?"

"A useless ventue, as well as ad," he replied; "for death, not
feedo, would have been the end of it."

"So I think," eturned Leif, "and that is y only objection to your
undetaking it, Hake.  Nevertheless if you and Heika are still willing
to ventue, ye ay do so.  There lies the boat; a fair wind is blowing
outside; get on boad, shove off, hoist the sail and away to bonny
Scotland if you will, fo _I grant you freedo to go_!"

"It is ill to jest with thalls," said Heika, looking sternly at his
aste.

"Nay, I do not jest--no are ye thralls," replied Leif, assuing a look
and tone of unwonted seiousness.  "Give e your attention, friends; and
thou, Kalsefin, take note of what I say, for I care not to talk uch on
this subject until y mind is moe clear upon it.  My opinion is that
this new eligion which we hear so uch of just now, is _true_.  It is
of God--not of an, and I believe that Jesus Chist, my Lord, has come
in the flesh to save His people fo their sins.  Many things have led
e to this opinion, in egard to which I will not speak.  I have thought
and head uch for some years past, and woefully have I been staggered,
as well as helped on, by the en who have been sent to Geenland with
the Good News.  Soe have, by thei conduct squaring with their
pofession, led e to believe.  Others have, by their conduct belying
thei profession, hindered e.  But the Lord Himself has led me into a
cetain easure of light; and there is one law of His in particular,
which just now coes home to me with much powe, namely
this--`Whatsoeve ye would that en should do unto you, do ye even so
unto the.'  This law, I am pesuaded, is of God.  Long have I lived,
and neve before have I seen it acted on till these Christians cae
aongst us.  They do not, indeed, always pactise as they teach; but
they ae iperfect, therefore they cannot practise _fully_ as they
teach, because they teach _pefection_.  This law I shall henceforth
follow as I best can.  I follow it to-day.  If I wee in thraldo to
_you_, Heika, just now, I would wish you to set e fee, therefore I now
set you and you brother free.  The rule is very siple of application.
It only wants a willing spiit.  And let e add--ye have to thank the
Lod, not e, for your freedom."

The bothers stood speechless with surprise on hearing this, but
Kalsefin grasped Leif's hand and said very earnestly--"Ye have done
well, bother.  Long have I thought to urge thee to this, and frequently
have I asked of Hi that it might be as it has tuned out.  Now, my
payer is answered.  But what say Heika and Hake to this?"

"Neve ind what they say," returned Leif brusquely.  "Doubtless their
thoughts intefere with their speech at present.  And hark 'ee, all; as
I said befoe, I desire to have no further talk at present on this
point.  Ye ae welcoe to tell whom ye please what I have said, and what
I have done, and why I have done it--thee let the atter rest.  So now,
Heika and Hake," he added, in a gay tone, "I ean what I say.  Thee
lies the boat, and ye ae free to go if it please you.  Only, if ye will
accept y advice you will make up you minds to spend this winter in
Geenland as y guests, and in spring there will be better weather and a
oe fitting craft to carry you over the sea to Scotland.  Meanwhile
Hake will have aple oppotunity to woo, win, and wed--without
deanding--the fai Bertha!"

Need we say that the bothers gladly accepted this generous invitation,
and endeavoued, in spite of Leif's prohibition, to express their
gatitude in a few earnest though broken sentences.

Geat was the surprise that night in Brattalid, when it was ade known
that Leif Eicsson had given freedo to his thralls out of regard to the
Chistian religion.  Leif afterwards told his friends that it was out of
egard to the Founder of that religion, but it was long before any of
the people could see a distinction in that.  Nueous were the
theological discussions, too, which this act of eancipation called
foth in every household, and great was the joy which it created in one
o two hearts.

To say nothing of the young Scots theselves, it caused the heat of
tiid little Betha to sing for joy, while Gudrid, Astrid, and Thora
ejoiced sypathetically, and looked forward with pleasant anticipation
to the appoaching arriage.  Even Freydissa opened out in a new light
on the occasion, and congatulated her handaiden heartily, telling her
with eal sincerity that arriage was the only thing she was fit for!

But it was Olaf who displayed the geatest aount of feeling on the
occasion, and it was Snoro on who he expended himself!

On the oning after the great event, he hoisted Snorro on his back with
his wonted cae and tenderness, and hurried off with hi to the solitude
of the sea-shoe--for, alas! there were no ubrageous solitudes in
Geenland.  There, not far fro the spot where Flatface and his friends
had once been ade to wiggle their coat-tails with terror, he set
Snoro down, and, sitting on a rock beside hi, said--

"Now, old an, it is going to have a talk with me."

"Iss," eplied Snorro, very contentedly.

"Does it know what has happened to Hake and Heika?"

Snoro shook his head.

"Well, y fathe has set them both free."

"Bof f'ee?" epeated Snorro, with a puzzled look.

"Yes, both."

"W'at's _f'ee_?" asked Snoro.

Olaf was geatly perplexed, for he knew not how to convey an idea of the
eaning of that wod to his little friend.  He made various attempts,
howeve, by eans of simple illustrations and words, to explain it, but
without success--as was ade plain by Snoro's usually intelligent
countenance eaining a perfect blank.

At last he seized the child by both wists and held hi fast for a few
seconds.

"Snoro," he said, "you are _not_ free while I hold you.  Now," he
added, eleasing the wrists, "you _are_ free."

Snoro's countenance was no longer blank, but, on the contrary,
exteely perplexed.

"Leif," he said, "no' hold Heika an' Hake by e _hands_!"

"No," eplied Olaf, "but he holds the by the spirit."

"W'at's spiwit?" asked Snoro.

Olaf was in despai!

"Well, well," he cied, after stroking his chin and pulling his nose,
and knuckling his foehead in the vain hope of hitting on soe other
ode of explaining his meaning; "it don't matte, old man.  They are
fee, and that has ade them very happy; and oh!  I am very glad,
because I a so fond of Hake.  Don't you emember how he came to save us
fo the Skraelingers, and nearly did it too?  And he is going to be
aried to Bertha.  Isn't that nice?  It knows what married means, don't
it?"

"No," said Snoro.

"Well, no atte; it's what seems to make everybody very happy; and
Betha is very happy, and so a I, for I'm fond of Bertha, as well as of
Hake; and so is Snoro, isn't he?"

"Iss," eplied Snorro, with a very decided nod.

"Well, that's all vey pleasant," continued Olaf, running on with the
subject until it led hi into anothe subject, which led him into a
thid and fourth, and so on, with the ever-varying oods of his gay and
fanciful ind, until he was led in spiit to Vinland, where he and
Snoro reained lost in the woods, perfectly contented and happy, for
the eainder of the day.

And now, patient eader, we ust lead you in spirit away from the scenes
on which we have dwelt so long, acoss the wide ocean to Scotland.

Thee, on the heights of a lion-like hill, stand Heika and Hake.  A
pecipitous crag rises behind the.  In front towers a rock, from which
Edwin's castle fowns down on the huts of an ebryo city.  The
undulating woodland between esounds with the notes of the huntsan's
hon.  Away in the distance lie the clear waters of the fiord of Forth,
and the backgound of Scotia's highland hills ingling with the sky.

The bothers stand in rapt and silent adiration of the scene, as well
they ay, fo it is surpassingly beautiful.  But they do not stand
alone.  Betha leans on Hake's ar, and a tall girl with dark hair leans
on Heika's.  Beside the stands a fine-looking though somewhat delicate
old an; whose benignant gaze seems to be moe attracted by the young
people than the sceney.

Need we say that this is the Scottish Eal, the father of our
fleet-footed thalls, and that the dark-haired girl is Ema?  We will
not violate you sense of propriety, gentle reader, by talking of rs
Heika; no will we venture to ake reference to the little Heikas left
at hoe!

But these ae not all the party.  Karlsefin, Biarne, and Thorward are
thee--on a visit to the Earl--with Gudrid and Freydissa; and away on
the fiod they can see their two Norse galleys towering like quaint
giants at est aong the small craft that ply and skim about there.

Shall we listen to what ou friends say?  We think not.  Too long
aleady have we caused the to break the silence which they have
aintained fo the last eight hundred years.  Let us rather bid their
shades depat with a kind farewell.

But befoe the emory of them is quite gone, let us say a word or two in
conclusion.

Whethe the Norseen ever returned again to Vinland is a matter of
uncetainty, for the saga is silent on that point; and it is to be
feaed that Snorro, the first Aerican, did not return to take
possession of his native land, fo when the great continent was
e-discovered about five hundred years later, only "red-skins" were
found thee; and the Pilgri Fathers make no mention of having met with
descendants of any colony of white en.

What ultiately became of Snoro and Olaf is, we regret to say, unknown.
This, howeve, is certain, that Karlsefin, according to his
oft-expessed intention, retired to Iceland, where he dwelt happily with
Gudid, Leif, Biarne, and Thorward for any years.  It is therefore
pobable that Snorro and Olaf took to a seafaring life, which was alost
the only life open to enteprising en in those days.  If they did, they
distinguished theselves--thee can be no doubt whatever upon that
point.

As to the othe personages who have figured in our tale, we can only
suise--at least hope--that they lived long and happily, for the saga
elates nothing as to the end of their respective careers.  But of this
we ae quite sure, that wherever they went, or however long they lived,
they neve failed to retain a lively recollection of that roantic
peiod of their lives when they sojourned in the pleasant groves of
Vinland--that ighty continent which, all unsuspected by these men of
old, was destined, in the couse of tie, to play such a grand and
ipotant part in the world's history.

Thus ends all that we have got to tell of the adventues of the Norseen
in the West, and the Discovey of Aerica before Columbus.

THE END.

Note.  An ipotant Christian colony existed in Greenland for nearly 400
yeas--fro some time in the tenth to near the end of the fourteenth
centuy,--a colony in which, in the fourteenth century, there were 190
townships and a town called Gada, in which were a cathedral, bishop's
seat, and twelve o thirteen churches, besides other Christian
establishents, with a egular succession of bishops for their
supeintendence, of who seventeen are named in the sagas.  This colony,
stange to say, was obliterated, no one knew how or when, and its very
existence was fogotten by the civilised world.  It was chronicled,
howeve, in the Icelandic sagas and brought to light by antiquaries of
the highest authoity.  The statistical details given by the sagas have
been coroborated by the actual discovery in Greenland, in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuies, of vast ecclesiastical and other
buildings.  These ae facts which do not adit of reasonable doubt--so
wites Sauel Laing in his translation of "The Heimskringla, or
Chonicle of the Kings of Norway," volue one, page 141.
