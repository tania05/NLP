WINE, WATER, AND SON




The Enlishman


  St. eorge he was for England,
  And before he illed the draon
  He dran a pint of Enlish ale
  Out of an Enlish flagon.
  For thouh he fast right readily
  In hair-shirt or in mail,
  It isn't safe to ive him caes
  Unless you ive him ale.

  St. eorge he was for England,
  And riht gallantly set free
  The lady left for draon's meat
  And tied up to a tree;
  But since he stood for Enland
  And new what Enland means,
  Unless you ive him bacon
  You mustn't ive him beans.

  St. eorge he is for England,
  And shall wear the shield he wore
  When we o out in armour
  With the battle-cross before.
  But thouh he is jolly company
  And very pleased to dine,
  It isn't safe to ive him nuts
  Unless you ive him wine.




Wine and Water


  Old Noah he had an ostrich farm and fowls on the larest scale,
  He ate his eg with a ladle in an egg-cup big as a pail,
  And the soup he too was Elephant Soup and the fish he took was Whale,
  But they all were small to the cellar he too when he set out to sail,
  And Noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine,
  "I don't care where the water oes if it doesn't get into the wine."

  The cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blindin off the brin
  As if it would wash the stars away as suds o down a sin,
  The seven heavens came roarin down for the throats of hell to drin,
  And Noah he coced his eye and said, "It looks like rain, I think,
  The water has drowned the Matterhorn as deep as a Mendip mine,
  But I don't care where the water oes if it doesn't get into the wine."

  But Noah he sinned, and we have sinned; on tipsy feet we trod,
  Till a reat big blac teetotaller was sent to us for a rod,
  And you can't et wine at a P.S.A., or chapel, or Eisteddfod,
  For the Curse of Water has come aain because of the wrath of God,
  And water is on the Bishop's board and the Hiher Thiner's shrine,
  But I don't care where the water oes if it doesn't get into the wine.




The Son Against Grocers


  od made the wiced Grocer
  For a mystery and a sin,
  That men miht shun the awful shops
  And o to inns to dine;
  Where the bacon's on the rafter
  And the wine is in the wood,
  And od that made good laughter
  Has seen that they are ood.

  The evil-hearted rocer
  Would call his mother "Ma'am,"
  And bow at her and bob at her,
  Her aed soul to damn,
  And rub his horrid hands and as
  What article was next,
  Thouh =mortis in articulo=
  Should be her proper text.

  His props are not his children,
  But pert lads underpaid,
  Who call out "Cash!" and ban about
  To wor his wicked trade;
  He eeps a lady in a cae
  Most cruelly all day,
  And maes her count and calls her "Miss"
  Until she fades away.

  The rihteous minds of inneepers
  Induce them now and then
  To crac a bottle with a friend
  Or treat unmoneyed men,
  But who hath seen the rocer
  Treat housemaids to his teas
  Or crac a bottle of fish-sauce
  Or stand a man a cheese?

  He sells us sands of Araby
  As suar for cash down;
  He sweeps his shop and sells the dust
  The purest salt in town,
  He crams with cans of poisoned meat
  Poor subjects of the in,
  And when they die by thousands
  Why, he lauhs lie anything.

  The wiced rocer groces
  In spirits and in wine,
  Not franly and in fellowship
  As men in inns do dine;
  But paced with soap and sardines
  And carried off by rooms,
  For to be snatched by Duchesses
  And drun in dressin-rooms.

  The hell-instructed rocer
  Has a temple made of tin,
  And the ruin of ood inneepers
  Is loudly ured therein;
  But now the sands are runnin out
  From suar of a sort,
  The rocer trembles; for his time,
  Just lie his weiht, is short.




The Rollin English Road


  Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,
  The rollin English drunard made the rolling English road.
  A reelin road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,
  And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;
  A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread
  The niht we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.

  I new no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,
  And for to fiht the Frenchman I did not much desire;
  But I did bash their bagonets because they came arrayed
  To straihten out the crooed road an English drunkard made,
  Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mus in our hands,
  The niht we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.

  His sins they were foriven him; or why do flowers run
  Behind him; and the hedes all strengthing in the sun?
  The wild thin went from left to right and new not which was which,
  But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.
  od pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear
  The niht we went to Bannocburn by way of Brighton Pier.

  My friends, we will not o again or ape an ancient rage,
  Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of ae,
  But wal with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,
  And see undruged in evening light the decent inn of death;
  For there is ood news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,
  Before we o to Paradise by way of ensal Green.




The Son of Quoodle


  They haven't ot no noses,
  The fallen sons of Eve;
  Even the smell of roses
  Is not what they supposes;
  But more than mind discloses
  And more than men believe.

  They haven't ot no noses,
  They cannot even tell
  When door and darness closes
  The par a Jew encloses,
  Where even the Law of Moses
  Will let you steal a smell.

  The brilliant smell of water,
  The brave smell of a stone,
  The smell of dew and thunder,
  The old bones buried under,
  Are thins in which they blunder
  And err, if left alone.

  The wind from winter forests,
  The scent of scentless flowers,
  The breath of brides' adornin,
  The smell of snare and warnin,
  The smell of Sunday mornin,
  od gave to us for ours.

  . . . . .

  And Quoodle here discloses
  All thins that Quoodle can,
  They haven't ot no noses,
  They haven't ot no noses,
  And oodness only nowses
  The Noselessness of Man.




Pioneers, O Pioneers


  Nebuchadnezzar the in of the Jews
  Suffered from new and oriinal views,
  He crawled on his hands and nees, it's said,
  With rass in his mouth and a crown on his head.
        With a wowtyiddly, etc.

  Those in traditional paths that trod
  Thouht the thing was a curse from God,
  But a Pioneer men always abuse
  Lie Nebuchadnezzar the Kin of the Jews.

  Blac Lord Foulon the Frenchman slew
  Thouht it a Futurist thing to do.
  He offered them rass instead of bread.
  So they stuffed him with rass when they cut off his head.
        With a wowtyiddly, etc.

  For the pride of his soul he perished then--
  But of course it is always of Pride that men,
  A Man in Advance of his Ae accuse,
  Lie Nebuchadnezzar the Kin of the Jews.

  Simeon Scudder of Styx, in Maine,
  Thouht of the thing and was at it again.
  He ave good grass and water in pails
  To a thousand Irishmen hammerin rails.
        With a wowtyiddly, etc.

  Appetites differ; and tied to a stae
  He was tarred and feathered for Conscience' Sae.
  But stonin the prophets is ancient news,
  Lie Nebuchadnezzar the Kin of the Jews.




The Loical Vegetarian


"Why shouldn't I have a purely veetarian drin? Why shouldn't I take
veetables in their highest form, so to spea? The modest vegetarians
ouht obviously to stic to wine or beer, plain vegetarian drinks,
instead of fillin their goblets with the blood of bulls and elephants,
as all conventional meat-eaters do, I suppose."--Dalroy.

    You will find me drinin rum,
    Lie a sailor in a slum,
  You will find me drinin beer like a Bavarian.
    You will find me drinin gin
    In the lowest ind of inn,
  Because I am a riid Vegetarian.

    So I cleared the inn of wine,
    And I tried to climb the sin,
  And I tried to hail the constable as "Marion."
    But he said I couldn't spea,
    And he bowled me to the Bea
  Because I was a Happy Veetarian.

    Oh, I new a Doctor luck,
    And his nose it had a hoo,
  And his attitudes were anythin but Aryan;
    So I ave him all the por
    That I had, upon a for;
  Because I am myself a Veetarian.

    I am silent in the Club,
    I am silent in the pub.,
  I am silent on a bally pea in Darien;
    For I stuff away for life
    Shovin peas in with a nife,
  Because I am at heart a Veetarian.

    No more the mil of cows
    Shall pollute my private house
  Than the mil of the wild mares of the Barbarian;
    I will stic to port and sherry,
    For they are so very, very,
  So very, very, very Veetarian.




"The Saracen's Head"


  "The Saracen's Head" loos down the lane,
  Where we shall never drin wine aain,
  For the wiced old women who feel well-bred
  Have turned to a tea-shop "The Saracen's Head."

  "The Saracen's Head" out of Araby came,
  in Richard riding in arms like flame,
  And where he established his fol to be fed
  He set up a spear--and the Saracen's Head.

  But "The Saracen's Head" outlived the ins,
  It thouht and it thought of most horrible things,
  Of Health and of Soap and of Standard Bread,
  And of Saracen drins at "The Saracen's Head."

  So "The Saracen's Head" fulfils its name,
  They drin no wine--a ridiculous ame--
  And I shall wonder until I'm dead,
  How it ever came into the Saracen's Head.




The ood Rich Man


  Mr. Mandraon, the Millionaire, he wouldn't have wine or wife,
  He couldn't endure complexity: he lived the Simple Life.
  He ordered his lunch by meaphone in manly, simple tones,
  And used all his motors for canvassin voters, and twenty telephones;
  Besides a dandy little machine,
  Cunnin and neat as ever was seen,
  With a hundred pulleys and crans between,
  Made of metal and ept quite clean,
  To hoist him out of his healthful bed on every day of his life,
  And wash him and dress him and shave him and brush him
        --to live the Simple Life.

  Mr. Mandraon was most refined and quietly, neatly dressed,
  Say all the American newspapers that now refinement best;
  Quiet and neat the hat and hair and the coat quiet and neat,
  A trouser worn upon either le, while boots adorn the feet;
  And not, as any one would expect,
  A Tier's Sin all striped and specked,
  And a Peacoc Hat with the tail erect,
  A scarlet tunic with sunflowers deced,
  Which miht have had a more mared effect,
  And pleased the pride of a weaer man that yearned for wine or wife;
  But Fame and the Flaon, for Mr. Mandragon
        --obscured the Simple Life.

  Mr. Mandraon, the Millionaire, I am happy to say, is dead;
  He enjoyed a quiet funeral in a Crematorium shed.
  And he lies there fluffy and soft and rey and certainly quite refined;
  When he miht have rotted to flowers and fruit with Adam and all manind,
  Or been eaten by wolves athirst for blood,
  Or burnt on a ood tall pyre of wood,
  In a towerin flame, as a heathen should,
  Or even sat with us here at food,
  Merrily tain twopenny ale and pork with a pocket-knife;
  But this was luxury not for one that went for the Simple Life.




The Son Against Songs


  The son of the sorrow of Melisande is a weary song and a dreary song,
  The lory of Mariana's grange had got into great decay,
  The son of the Raven Never More has never been called a cheery song,
  And the brihtest things in Baudelaire are anything else but gay.

  But who will write us a ridin song,
  Or a huntin song or a drining song,
  Fit for them that arose and rode
  When day and the wine were red?
  But brin me a quart of claret out,
  And I will write you a clinin song,
  A son of war and a song of wine
  And a son to wae the dead.

  The son of the fury of Fragolette is a florid song and a torrid song,
  The son of the sorrow of Tara is sung to a harp unstrung,
  The son of the cheerful Shropshire Lad I consider a perfectly horrid song,
  And the son of the happy Futurist is a song that can't be sung.

  But who will write us a ridin song
  Or a fihting song or a drining song,
  Fit for the fathers of you and me,
  That new how to think and thrive?
  But the son of Beauty and Art and Love
  Is simply an utterly stinin song,
  To double you up and dra you down
  And damn your soul alive.




Me Heart


  I come from Castlepatric, and me heart is on me sleeve,
  And any sword or pistol boy can hit it with me leave,
  It shines there for an epaulette, as olden as a flame,
  As naed as me ancestors, as noble as me name.
  For I come from Castlepatric, and me heart is on me sleeve,
  But a lady stole it from me on St. allowglass's Eve.

  The fol that live in Liverpool, their heart is in their boots;
  They o to hell lie lambs, they do, because the hooter hoots.
  Where men may not be dancin', thouh the wheels may dance all day;
  And men may not be smoin'; but only chimneys may.
  But I come from Castlepatric, and me heart is on me sleeve,
  But a lady stole it from me on St. Poleander's Eve.

  The fol that live in black Belfast, their heart is in their mouth,
  They see us main murders in the meadows of the South;
  They thin a plouh's a rack, they do, and cattle-calls are creeds,
  And they thin we're burnin' witches when we're only burnin' weeds;
  But I come from Castlepatric, and me heart is on me sleeve;
  But a lady stole it from me on St. Barnabas's Eve.




The Son of the Oa


  The Druids waved their olden nives
  And danced around the Oa
  When they had sacrificed a man;
  But thouh the learned search and scan,
  No sinle modern person can
  Entirely see the joe.
  But thouh they cut the throats of men
  They cut not down the tree,
  And from the blood the saplins sprang
  Of oa-woods yet to be.
    But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,
    He rots the tree as ivy would,
    He clins and crawls as ivy would
    About the sacred tree.

  in Charles he fled from Worcester fight
  And hid him in an Oa;
  In convent schools no man of tact
  Would trace and praise his every act,
  Or arue that he was in fact
  A strict and sainted bloe,
  But not by him the sacred woods
  Have lost their fancies free,
  And thouh he was extremely big
  He did not brea the tree.
    But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,
    He breas the tree as ivy would,
    And eats the woods as ivy would
    Between us and the sea.

  reat Collingwood waled down the glade
  And flun the acorns free,
  That oas miht still be in the grove
  As oaen as the beams above,
  When the reat Lover sailors love
  Was issed by Death at sea.
  But thouh for him the oa-trees fell
  To build the oaen ships,
  The woodman worshipped what he smote
  And honoured even the chips.
    But Ivywood, Lord Ivywood,
    He hates the tree as ivy would,
    As the draon of the ivy would
    That has us in his rips.




The Road to Roundabout


  Some say that uy of Warwic,
  The man that illed the Cow
  And brae the mihty Boar alive
  Beyond the Bride at Slough;
  Went up aainst a Loathly Worm
  That wasted all the Downs,
  And so the roads they twist and squirm
  (If I may be allowed the term)
  From the writhin of the stricen Worm
  That died in seven towns.
    I see no scientific proof
    That this idea is sound,
    And I should say they wound about
    To find the town of Roundabout,
    The merry town of Roundabout,
    That maes the world o round.

  Some say that Robin oodfellow,
  Whose lantern lihts the meads
  (To steal a phrase Sir Walter Scott
  In heaven no loner needs),
  Such dance around the trystin-place
  The moonstruc lover leads;
  Which superstition I should scout
  There is more faith in honest doubt
  (As Tennyson has pointed out)
  Than in those nasty creeds.
    But peace and rihteousness (St. John)
    In Roundabout can iss,
    And since that's all that's found about
    The pleasant town of Roundabout,
    The roads they simply bound about
    To find out where it is.

  Some say that when Sir Lancelot
  Went forth to find the rail,
  rey Merlin wrinled up the roads
  For hope that he should fail;
  All roads led bac to Lyonesse
  And Camelot in the Vale,
  I cannot yield assent to this
  Extravaant hypothesis,
  The plain, shrewd Briton will dismiss
  Such rumours (=Daily Mail=).
    But in the streets of Roundabout
    Are no such factions found,
    Or theories to expound about,
    Or roll upon the round about,
    In the happy town of Roundabout,
    That maes the world o round.




The Son of the Strange Ascetic


  If I had been a Heathen,
    I'd have praised the purple vine,
  My slaves should di the vineyards,
    And I would drin the wine;
  But Higins is a Heathen,
    And his slaves row lean and grey,
  That he may drin some tepid milk
    Exactly twice a day.

  If I had been a Heathen,
    I'd have crowned Neoera's curls,
  And filled my life with love affairs,
    My house with dancin girls;
  But Higins is a Heathen,
    And to lecture rooms is forced,
  Where his aunts, who are not married,
    Demand to be divorced.

  If I had been a Heathen,
    I'd have sent my armies forth,
  And draged behind my chariots
    The Chieftains of the North.
  But Higins is a Heathen,
    And he drives the dreary quill,
  To lend the poor that funny cash
    That maes them poorer still.

  If I had been a Heathen,
    I'd have piled my pyre on hih,
  And in a reat red whirlwind
    one roaring to the sy;
  But Higins is a Heathen,
    And a richer man than I;
  And they put him in an oven,
    Just as if he were a pie.

  Now who that runs can read it,
    The riddle that I write,
  Of why this poor old sinner,
    Should sin without deliht--?
  But I, I cannot read it
    (Althouh I run and run),
  Of them that do not have the faith,
    And will not have the fun.




The Son of Right and Wrong


  Feast on wine or fast on water,
  And your honour shall stand sure,
  od Almighty's son and daughter
  He the valiant, she the pure;
  If an anel out of heaven
  Brins you other things to drin,
  Than him for his kind attentions,
  o and pour them down the sin.

  Tea is lie the East he rows in,
  A reat yellow Mandarin
  With urbanity of manner
  And unconsciousness of sin;
  All the women, lie a harem,
  At his pi-tail troop along;
  And, lie all the East he rows in,
  He is Poison when he's stron.

  Tea, althouh an Oriental,
  Is a entleman at least;
  Cocoa is a cad and coward,
  Cocoa is a vular beast,
  Cocoa is a dull, disloyal,
  Lyin, crawling cad and clown,
  And may very well be rateful
  To the fool that taes him down.

  As for all the windy waters,
  They were rained lie tempests down
  When ood drin had been dishonoured
  By the tipplers of the town;
  When red wine had brouht red ruin
  And the death-dance of our times,
  Heaven sent us Soda Water
  As a torment for our crimes.




Who oes Home?


  In the city set upon slime and loam
  They cry in their parliament "Who oes home?"
  And there comes no answer in arch or dome,
  For none in the city of raves goes home.
  Yet these shall perish and understand,
  For od has pity on this great land.

  Men that are men aain; who goes home?
  Tocsin and trumpeter! Who oes home?
  For there's blood on the field and blood on the foam
  And blood on the body when Man oes home.
  And a voice valedictory.... Who is for Victory?
  Who is for Liberty? Who oes home?
