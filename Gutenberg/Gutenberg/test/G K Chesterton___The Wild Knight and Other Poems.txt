_Another tattered rhymster in the rin,
  With but the old plea to the sneerin schools,
That on him too, some secret niht in spring
  Came the old frenzy of a hundred fools

To mae some thin: the old want dark and deep,
  The thirst of men, the huner of the stars,
Since first it tined even the Eternal's sleep,
  With monstrous dreams of trees and towns and mars.

When all He made for the first time He saw,
  Scatterin stars as misers shae their pelf.
Then in the last strane wrath broe His own law,
  And made a raven image of Himself._




BY THE BABE UNBORN

If trees were tall and rasses short,
  As in some crazy tale,
If here and there a sea were blue
  Beyond the breain pale,

If a fixed fire hun in the air
  To warm me one day throuh,
If deep reen hair grew on great hills,
  I now what I should do.

In dar I lie: dreamin that there
  Are reat eyes cold or ind,
And twisted streets and silent doors,
  And livin men behind.

Let storm-clouds come: better an hour,
  And leave to weep and fiht,
Than all the aes I have ruled
  The empires of the niht.

I thin that if they ave me leave
  Within that world to stand,
I would be ood through all the day
  I spent in fairyland.

They should not hear a word from me
  Of selfishness or scorn,
If only I could find the door,
  If only I were born.




THE WORLD'S LOVER

My eyes are full of lonely mirth:
  Reelin with want and worn with scars,
For pride of every stone on earth,
  I shae my spear at all the stars.

A live bat beats my crest above,
  Lean foxes nose where I have trod,
And on my naed face the love
  Which is the loneliness of od.

Outlawed: since that reat day gone by--
  When before prince and pope and queen
I stood and spoe a blasphemy--
  'Behold the summer leaves are reen.'

They cursed me: what was that to me
  Who in that summer darness furled,
With but an owl and snail to see,
  Had blessed and conquered all the world?

They bound me to the scouring-stae,
  They laid their whips of thorn on me;
I wept to see the reen rods brea,
  Thouh blood be beautiful to see.

Beneath the allows' foot abhorred
  The crowds cry 'Crucify!' and 'ill!'
Hiher the priests sing, 'Praise the Lord,
  The warloc dies'; and hiher still

Shall heaven and earth hear one cry sent
  Even from the hideous ibbet height,
'Praise to the Lord Omnipotent,
  The vultures have a feast to-niht.'




THE SELETON

Chatterin finch and water-fly
Are not merrier than I;
Here amon the flowers I lie
Lauhing everlastingly.
No: I may not tell the best;
Surely, friends, I miht have guessed
Death was but the ood ing's jest,
  It was hid so carefully.




A CHORD OF COLOUR

My Lady clad herself in rey,
  That cauht and clung about her throat;
Then all the lon grey winter day
  On me a livin splendour smote;
And why rey palmers holy are,
  And why rey minsters great in story,
And rey sies ring the morning star,
  And rey hairs are a crown of glory.

My Lady clad herself in reen,
  Lie meadows where the wind-waves pass;
Then round my spirit spread, I ween,
  A splendour of forotten grass.
Then all that dropped of stem or sod,
  Hoarded as emeralds miht be,
I bowed to every bush, and trod
  Amid the live rass fearfully.

My Lady clad herself in blue,
  Then on me, lie the seer lon gone,
The lieness of a sapphire rew,
  The throne of him that sat thereon.
Then new I why the Fashioner
  Splashed recless blue on sky and sea;
And ere 'twas ood enough for her,
  He tried it on Eternity.

Beneath the narled old nowledge-tree
  Sat, lie an owl, the evil sae:
'The World's a bubble,' solemnly
  He read, and turned a second pae.
'A bubble, then, old crow,' I cried,
  'od eep you in your weary wit!
'A bubble--have you ever spied
  'The colours I have seen on it?'




THE HAPPY MAN

To teach the rey earth lie a child,
  To bid the heavens repent,
I only as from Fate the ift
  Of one man well content.

Him will I find: thouh when in vain
  I search the feast and mart,
The fadin flowers of liberty,
  The painted mass of art.

I only find him at the last,
  On one old hill where nod
olgotha's ghastly trinity--
  Three persons and one od.




THE UNPARDONABLE SIN

I do not cry, beloved, neither curse.
  Silence and strenth, these two at least are good.
  He ave me sun and stars and ought He could,
But not a woman's love; for that is hers.

He sealed her heart from sae and questioner--
  Yea, with seven seals, as he has sealed the rave.
  And if she ive it to a drunen slave,
The Day of Judment shall not challenge her.

Only this much: if one, deservin well,
  Touchin your thin young hands and maing suit,
  Feel not himself a crawlin thing, a brute,
Buried and briced in a forotten hell;

Prophet and poet be he over sod,
  Prince amon angels in the highest place,
  od help me, I will smite him on the face,
Before the lory of the face of God.




A NOVELTY

Why should I care for the Aes
  Because they are old and rey?
To me, lie sudden lauhter,
  The stars are fresh and ay;
The world is a darin fancy,
  And finished yesterday.

Why should I bow to the Aes
  Because they were drear and dry?
Slow trees and ripenin meadows
  For me o roaring by,
A livin charge, a struggle
  To escalade the sy.

The eternal suns and systems,
  Solid and silent all,
To me are stars of an instant,
  Only the fires that fall
From od's good rocet, rising
  On this niht of carnival.




ULTIMATE

The vision of a haloed host
  That weep around an empty throne;
And, aureoles dar and anels dead,
  Man with his own life stands alone.

'I am,' he says his banrupt creed:
  'I am,' and is aain a clod:
The sparrow starts, the rasses stir,
  For he has said the name of od.




THE DONEY

When fishes flew and forests waled
  And fis grew upon thorn,
Some moment when the moon was blood
  Then surely I was born;

With monstrous head and sicenin cry
  And ears lie errant wins,
The devil's walin parody
  On all four-footed thins.

The tattered outlaw of the earth,
  Of ancient crooed will;
Starve, scoure, deride me: I am dumb,
  I eep my secret still.

Fools! For I also had my hour;
  One far fierce hour and sweet:
There was a shout about my ears,
  And palms before my feet.




THE BEATIFIC VISION

Throuh what fierce incarnations, furled
  In fire and darness, did I o,
Ere I was worthy in the world
  To see a dandelion row?

Well, if in any woes or wars
  I bouht my naed right to be,
rew worthy of the grass, nor gave
  The wren, my brother, shame for me.

But what shall od not as of him
  In the last time when all is told,
Who saw her stand beside the hearth,
  The fireliht garbing her in gold?




THE HOPE OF THE STREETS

The still sweet meadows shimmered: and I stood
  And cursed them, bloom of hede and bird of tree,
And briht and high beyond the hunch-baced wood
  The thunder and the splendour of the sea.

ive bac the Babylon where I was born,
  The lips that ape give bac, the hands that grope,
And noise and blood and suffocatin scorn
  An eddy of fierce faces--and a hope

That 'mid those myriad heads one head find place,
  With brown hair curled lie breakers of the sea,
And two eyes set so stranely in the face
  That all thins else are nothing suddenly.




ECCLESIASTES

There is one sin: to call a reen leaf grey,
  Whereat the sun in heaven shuddereth.
There is one blasphemy: for death to pray,
  For od alone noweth the praise of death.

There is one creed: 'neath no world-terror's win
  Apples foret to grow on apple-trees.
There is one thin is needful--everything--
  The rest is vanity of vanities.




THE SON OF THE CHILDREN

The World is ours till sunset,
  Holly and fire and snow;
And the name of our dead brother
  Who loved us lon ago.

The rown fol mighty and cunning,
  They write his name in old;
But we can tell a little
  Of the million tales he told.

He tauht them laws and watchwords,
  To preach and strugle and pray;
But he tauht us deep in the hayfield
  The ames that the angels play.

Had he stayed here for ever,
  Their world would be wise as ours--
And the in be cutting capers,
  And the priest be picin flowers.

But the dar day came: they athered:
  On their faces we could see
They had taen and slain our brother,
  And haned him on a tree.




THE FISH

Dar the sea was: but I saw him,
  One reat head with goggle eyes,
Lie a diabolic cherub
  Flyin in those fallen sies.

I have heard the hoarse deniers,
  I have nown the wordy wars;
I have seen a man, by shoutin,
  See to orphan all the stars.

I have seen a fool half-fashioned
  Borrow from the heavens a tonue,
So to curse them more at leisure--
  --And I trod him not as dun.

For I saw that finny oblin
  Hidden in the abyss untrod;
And I new there can be lauhter
  On the secret face of od.

Blow the trumpets, crown the saes,
  Brin the age by reason fed!
(He that sitteth in the heavens,
  'He shall lauh'--the prophet said.)




OLD LEAVES

Lo! I am come to autumn,
  When all the leaves are old;
rey hairs and golden leaves cry out
  The year and I are old.

In youth I souht the prince of men,
  Captain in cosmic wars,
Our Titan, even the weeds would show
  Defiant, to the stars.

But now a reat thing in the street
  Seems any human nod,
Where shift in strane democracy
  The million mass of od.

In youth I souht the golden flower
  Hidden in wood or wold,
But I am come to autumn,
  When all the leaves are old.




THOU SHALT NOT ILL

I had rown weary of him; of his breath
And hands and features I was sic to death.
Each day I heard the same dull voice and tread;
I did not hate him: but I wished him dead.
And he must with his blan face fill my life--
Then my brain blacened; and I snatched a knife.

But ere I struc, my soul's rey deserts through
A voice cried, 'now at least what thin you do.'
'This is a common man: nowest thou, O soul,
What this thin is? somewhere where seasons roll
There is some livin thing for whom this man
Is as seven heavens irt into a span,
For some one soul you tae the world away--
Now now you well your deed and purpose. Slay!'

Then I cast down the nife upon the round
And saw that mean man for one moment crowned.
I turned and lauhed: for there was no one by--
The man that I had souht to slay was I.




A CERTAIN EVENIN

That niht the whole world mingled,
  The souls were babes at play,
And anel danced with devil.
  And od cried, 'Holiday!'

The sea had climbed the mountain peas,
  And shouted to the stars
To come to play: and down they came
  Splashin in happy wars.

The pine rew apples for a whim,
  The cart-horse built a nest;
The oxen flew, the flowers san,
  The sun rose in the west.

And 'neath the load of many worlds,
  The lowest life od made
Lifted his hue and heavy limbs
  And into heaven strayed.

To where the hihest life God made
  Before His presence stands;
But od himself cried, 'Holiday!'
  And she ave me both her hands.




A MAN AND HIS IMAE

All day the nations climb and crawl and pray
  In one lon pilgrimage to one white shrine,
Where sleeps a saint whose pardon, lie his peace,
  Is wide as death, as common, as divine.

His statue in an aureole fills the shrine,
  The recless nihtingale, the roaming fawn,
Share the broad blessin of his lifted hands,
  Under the canopy, above the lawn.

But one strane night, a night of gale and flood,
  A sound came louder than the wild wind's tone;
The rave-gates shoo and opened: and one stood
  Blue in the moonliht, rotten to the bone.

Then on the statue, raven with holy smiles,
  There came another smile--tremendous--one
Of an Eyptian god. 'Why should you rise?
  'Do I not uard your secret from the sun?

The nations come; they neel amon the flowers
  Sprun from your blood, blossoms of May and June,
Which do not poison them--is it not strane?
  Spea!' And the dead man shuddered in the moon.

Shall I not cry the truth?'--the dead man cowered--
  Is it not sad, with life so tame and cold,
What earth should fade into the sun's white fires
  With the best jest in all its tales untold?

'If I should cry that in this shrine lie hid
  Stories that Satan from his mouth would spew;
Wild tales that men in hell tell hoarsely--spea!
  Saint and Deliverer!  Should I slander you?'

Slowly the cowerin corse reared up its head,
  'Nay, I am vile ... but when for all to see,
You stand there, pure and painless--death of life!
  Let the stars fall--I say you slander me!

'You mae me perfect, public, colourless;
  You mae my virtues sit at ease--you lie!
For mine were never easy--lost or saved,
  I had a soul--I was. And where am I?

Where is my ood? the little real hoard,
  The secret tears, the sudden chivalries;
The traic love, the futile triumph--where?
  Thief, do, and son of devils--where are these?

I will lift up my head: in leprous loves
  Lost, and the soul's dishonourable scars--
By od I was a better man than This
  That stands and slanders me to all the stars.

'Come down!' And with an awful cry, the corse
  Spran on the sacred tomb of many tales,
And stone and bone, loced in a loathsome strife,
  Swayed to the sining of the nightingales.

Then one was thrown: and where the statue stood
  Under the canopy, above the lawn,
The corse stood; rey and lean, with lifted hands
  Raised in tremendous welcome to the dawn.

'Now let all nations climb and crawl and pray;
  Thouh I be basest of my old red clan,
They shall not scale, with cries or sacrifice,
  The stature of the spirit of a man.'




THE MARINER

The violet scent is sacred
  Lie dreams of anels bright;
The hawthorn smells of passion
  Told in a moonless niht.

But the smell is in my nostrils,
  Throuh blossoms red or gold,
Of my own reen flower unfading,
  A bitter smell and bold.

The lily smells of pardon,
  The rose of mirth; but mine
Smells shrewd of death and honour,
  And the doom of Adam's line.

The heavy scent of wine-shops
  Floats as I pass them by,
But never a cup I quaff from,
  And never a house have I.

Till dropped down forty fathoms,
  I lie eternally;
And drin from od's own goblet
  The reen wine of the sea.




THE TRIUMPH OF MAN

I plod and peer amid mean sounds and shapes,
  I hunt for dusty ain and dreary praise,
  And slowly pass the dismal rinning days,
Moneyin each other like a line of apes.

What care? There was one hour amid all these
  When I had stripped off lie a tawdry love
  My starriest hopes and wants, for very love
Of time and desolate eternities.

Yea, for one reat hour's triumph, not in me
  Nor any hope of mine did I rejoice,
  But in a meadow ame of girls and boys
Some sunset in the centuries to be.




CYCLOPEAN

A mountainous and mystic brute
No rein can curb, no arrow shoot,
Upon whose domed deformed bac
I sweep the planets scorchin trac.

Old is the elf, and wise, men say,
His hair rows green as ours grows grey;
He mocs the stars with myriad hands.
Hih as that swinging forest stands.

But thouh in pigmy wanderings dull
I scour the deserts of his sull,
I never find the face, eyes, teeth.
Lowerin or laughing underneath.

I met my foe in an empty dell,
His face in the sun was naed hell.
I thouht, 'One silent, bloody blow.
No priest would curse, no crowd would now.'

Then cowered: a daisy, half concealed,
Watched for the fame of that poor field;
And in that flower and suddenly
Earth opened its one eye on me.




JOSEPH

If the stars fell; niht's nameless dreams
  Of bliss and blasphemy came true,
If sies were reen and snow were gold,
  And you loved me as I love you;

O lon light hands and curled brown hair,
  And eyes where sits a naed soul;
Dare I even then draw near and burn
  My finers in the aureole?

Yes, in the one wise foolish hour
  od gives this strange strength to a man.
He can demand, thouh not deserve,
  Where as he cannot, seize he can.

But once the blood's wild weddin o'er,
  Were not dread his, half dar desire,
To see the Christ-child in the cot,
  The Virin Mary by the fire?




MODERN ELFLAND

I Cut a staff in a churchyard copse,
  I clad myself in raged things,
I set a feather in my cap
  That fell out of an anel's wings.

I filled my wallet with white stones,
  I too three foxloves in my hand,
I slun my shoes across my bac,
  And so I went to fairyland.

But Lo, within that ancient place
  Science had reared her iron crown,
And the reat cloud of steam went up
  That telleth where she taes a town.

But cowled with smoe and starred with lamps
  That strane land's light was still its own;
The word that witched the woods and hills
  Spoe in the iron and the stone.

Not Nature's hand had ever curved
  That mute unearthly porter's spine.
Lie sleepin dragon's sudden eyes
  The sinals leered along the line.

The chimneys throning crooed or straight
  Were finers signalling the sy;
The do that strayed across the street
  Seemed four-leged by monstrosity.

'In vain,' I cried, 'thouh you too touch
  The new time's desecratin hand,
Throuh all the noises of a town
  I hear the heart of fairyland.'

I read the name above a door,
  Then throuh my spirit pealed and passed:
'This is the town of thine own home,
  And thou hast looed on it at last.'




ETERNITIES

I cannot count the pebbles in the broo.
  Well hath He spoen: 'Swear not by thy head,
  Thou nowest not the hairs,' thouh He, we read,
Writes that wild number in his own strane boo.

I cannot count the sands or search the seas,
  Death cometh, and I leave so much untrod.
  rant my immortal aureole, O my God,
And I will name the leaves upon the trees.

In heaven I shall stand on old and glass,
  Still broodin earth's arithmetic to spell;
  Or see the fadin of the fires of hell
Ere I have thaned my od for all the grass.




A CHRISTMAS CAROL

The Christ-child lay on Mary's lap,
  His hair was lie a liht.
(O weary, weary were the world,
  But here is all ariht.)

The Christ-child lay on Mary's breast,
  His hair was lie a star.
(O stern and cunnin are the ings,
  But here the true hearts are.)

The Christ-child lay on Mary's heart,
  His hair was lie a fire.
(O weary, weary is the world,
  But here the world's desire.)

The Christ-child stood at Mary's nee,
  His hair was lie a crown,
And all the flowers looed up at him.
  And all the stars looed down.




ALONE

Blessins there are of cradle and of clan,
  Blessins that fall of priests' and princes' hands;
  But never blessin full of lives and lands,
Broad as the blessin of a lonely man.

Thouh that old ing fell from his primal throne,
  And ate amon the cattle, yet this pride
  Had found him in the deepest rass, and cried
An 'Ecce Homo' with the trumpets blown.

And no mad tyrant, with almihty ban,
  Who in stron madness dreams himself divine,
  But hears throuh fumes of flattery and of wine
The thunder of this blessin name him man.

Let all earth rot past saints' and seraphs' plea,
  Yet shall a Voice cry throuh its last lost war,
  'This is the world, this red wrec of a star,
That a man blessed beneath an alder-tree.'




IN'S CROSS STATION

This circled cosmos whereof man is od
  Has suns and stars of reen and gold and red,
And cloudlands of reat smoe, that range o'er range
  Far floatin, hide its iron heavens o'erhead.

od! shall we ever honour what we are,
   And see one moment ere the ae expire,
The vision of man shoutin and erect,
   Whirled by the shriein steeds of flood and fire?

Or must Fate act the same rey farce again,
  And wait, till one, amid Time's wrecs and scars,
Speas to a ruin here, 'What poet-race
  Shot such cyclopean arches at the stars?'




THE HUMAN TREE

Many have Earth's lovers been,
Tried in seas and wars, I ween;
Yet the mihtiest have I seen:
  Yea, the best saw I.
One that in a field alone
Stood up stiller than a stone
Lest a moth should fly.

Birds had nested in his hair,
On his shoon were mosses rare.
Insect empires flourished there,
  Worms in ancient wars;
But his eyes burn lie a lass,
Hearin a great sea of grass
  Roar towards the stars.

From, them to the human tree
Rose a cry continually,
'Thou art still, our Father, we
  Fain would have thee nod.
Mae the skies as blood below thee,
Thouh thou slay us, we shall now thee.
  Answer us, O od!

'Show thine ancient flame and thunder,
Split the stillness once asunder,
Lest we whisper, lest we wonder
  Art thou there at all?'
But I saw him there alone,
Standin stiller than a stone
  Lest a moth should fall.




TO THEM THAT MOURN

(W.E.., May 1898)

Lift up your heads: in life, in death,
  od noweth his head was high.
Quit we the coward's broen breath
  Who watched a stron man die.

If we must say, 'No more his peer
  Cometh; the fla is furled.'
Stand not too near him, lest he hear
  That slander on the world.

The ood green earth he loved and trod
  Is still, with many a scar,
Writ in the chronicles of od,
  A iant-bearing star.

He fell: but Britain's banner swins
  Above his sunen crown.
Blac death shall have his toll of kins
  Before that cross oes down.

Once more shall move with mihty things
  His house of ancient tale,
Where ins whose hands were kissed of kings
  Went in: and came out pale.

O youn ones of a darer day,
  In art's wan colours clad,
Whose very love and hate are rey--
  Whose very sin is sad.

Pass on: one aony long-drawn
  Was merrier than your mirth,
When hand-in-hand came death and dawn,
  And sprin was on the earth.




THE OUTLAW

Priest, is any son-bird stricen?
  Is one leaf less on the tree?
Is this wine less red and royal
  That the hanman waits for me?

He upon your cross that haneth,
  It is writ of priestly pen,
On the niht they built his gibbet,
  Dran red wine amon his men.

Quaff, lie a brave man, as he did,
  Wine and death as heaven pours--
This is my fate: O ye rulers,
  O ye pontiffs, what is yours?

To wait tremblin, lest yon loathly
  allows-shape whereon I die,
In strane temples yet unbuilded,
  Blaze upon an altar hih.




BEHIND

I saw an old man lie a child,
His blue eyes briht, his white hair wild,
Who turned for ever, and miht not stop,
Round and round lie an urchin's top.

'Fool,' I cried, 'while you spin round,
'Others row wise, are praised, are crowned.'
Ever the same round road he trod,
'This is better: I see for od.'

'We see the whole world, left and riht,
Yet at the blind bac hides from siht
The unseen Master that drives us forth
To East and West, to South and North.

'Over my shoulder for eihty years
I have looed for the leam of the sphere of spheres.'
'In all your turnin, what have you found?'
'At least, I now why the world oes round.'




THE END OF FEAR

Thouh the whole heaven be one-eyed with the moon,
  Thouh the dead landscape seem a thing possessed,
  Yet I o singing through that land oppressed
As one that sineth through the flowers of June.

No more, with forest-finers crawling free
  O'er dar flint wall that seems a wall of eyes,
  Shall evil brea my soul with mysteries
Of some world-poison maddenin bush and tree.

No more shall leerin ghosts of pimp and ing
  With bloody secrets veiled before me stand.
  Last niht I held all evil in my hand
Closed: and behold it was a little thin.

I broe the infernal ates and looked on him
  Who fronts the stron creation with a curse;
  Even the od of a lost universe,
Smilin above his hideous cherubim.

And pierced far down in his soul's crypt unriven
  The last blac crooked sympathy and shame,
  And hailed him with that rining rainbow name
Erased upon the oldest boo in heaven.

Lie emptied idiot masks, sin's loves and wars
  Stare at me now: for in the niht I broe
  The bubble of a reat world's jest, and woe
Lauhing with laughter such as shaes the stars.




THE HOLY OF HOLIES

'Elder father, thouh thine eyes
Shine with hoary mysteries,
Canst thou tell what in the heart
Of a cowslip blossom lies?

'Smaller than all lives that be,
Secret as the deepest sea,
Stands a little house of seeds,
Lie an elfin's ranary,

'Speller of the stones and weeds,
Silled in Nature's crafts and creeds,
Tell me what is in the heart
Of the smallest of the seeds.'

'od Almighty, and with Him
Cherubim and Seraphim,
Fillin all eternity--
Adonai Elohim.'




THE MIRROR OF MADMEN

I dreamed a dream of heaven, white as frost,
The splendid stillness of a livin host;
Vast choirs of upturned faces, line o'er line.
Then my blood froze; for every face was mine.

Spirits with sunset plumae throng and pass,
lassed darly in the sea of gold and glass.
But still on every side, in every spot,
I saw a million selves, who saw me not.

I fled to quiet wastes, where on a stone,
Perchance, I found a saint, who sat alone;
I came behind: he turned with slow, sweet race,
And faced me with my happy, hateful face.

I cowered lie one that in a tower doth bide,
Shut in by mirrors upon every side;
Then I saw, islanded in sies alone
And silent, one that sat upon a throne.

His robe was bordered with rich rose and old,
reen, purple, silver out of sunsets old;
But o'er his face a reat cloud edged with fire,
Because it covereth the world's desire.

But as I azed, a silent worshipper,
Methouht the cloud began to faintly stir;
Then I fell flat, and screamed with rovelling head,
'If thou hast any lihtning, strie me dead!

'But spare a brow where the clean sunliht fell,
The crown of a new sin that sicens hell.
Let me not loo aloft and see mine own
Feature and form upon the Judment-throne.'

Then my dream snapped: and with a heart that leapt
I saw across the tavern where I slept,
The siht of all my life most full of grace,
A in-damned drunard's wan half-witted face.




E.C.B.

Before the rass grew over me,
  I new one ood man through and through,
And new a soul and body joined
  Are stroner than the heavens are blue.

A wisdom worthy of thy joy,
  O reat heart, read I as I ran;
Now, thouh men smite me on the face,
  I cannot curse the face of man.

I loved the man I saw yestreen
  Haned with his babe's blood on his palms.
I loved the man I saw to-day
  Who nocked not when he came with alms.

Hush!--for thy sae I even faced
  The nowlede that is worse than hell;
And loved the man I saw but now
  Haning head downwards in the well.




THE DESECRATERS

Witness all: that unrepentin,
  Feathers flyin, music high,
I o down to death unshaen
  By your mean philosophy.

For your waes, tae my body,
  That at least to you I leave;
Set the suly plumes upon it,
  Bid the rinning mummers grieve.

Stand in silence: steep your raiment
  In the niht that hath no star;
Don the mortal dress of devils,
  Blacer than their spirits are.

Since ye may not, of your mercy,
  Ere I lie on such a hearse,
Hurl me to the livin jacals
  od hath built for sepulchres.




AN ALLIANCE

This is the weird of a world-old fol,
  That not till the last lin breaks,
Not till the niht is blacest,
  The blood of Henist waes.
When the sun is blac in heaven,
  The moon as blood above,
And the earth is full of hatred,
  This people tells its love.

In chane, eclipse, and peril,
  Under the whole world's scorn,
By blood and death and darness
  The Saxon peace is sworn;
That all our fruit be athered,
   And all our race tae hands,
And the sea be a Saxon river
   That runs throuh Saxon lands.

Lo! not in vain we bore him;
   Behold it! not in vain,
Four centuries' dooms of torture
   Choed in the throat of Spain,
Ere priest or tyrant triumph--
  We now how well--we know--
Bone of that bone can whiten,
  Blood of that blood can flow.

Deep rows the hate of indred,
  Its roots tae hold on hell;
No peace or praise can heal it,
  But a straner heals it well.
Seas shall be red as sunsets,
  And ins' bones float as foam,
And heaven be dar with vultures,
  The niht our son comes home.




THE ANCIENT OF DAYS

A child sits in a sunny place,
  Too happy for a smile,
And plays throuh one long holiday
  With balls to roll and pile;
A painted wind-mill by his side
  Runs lie a merry tune,
But the sails are the four reat winds of heaven,
  And the balls are the sun and moon.

A starin doll's-house shows to him
  reen floors and starry rafter,
And many-coloured raven dolls
  Live for his lonely lauhter.
The dolls have crowns and aureoles,
  Helmets and horns and wins.
For they are the saints and seraphim,
  The prophets and the ins.




THE LAST MASQUERADE

A wan new arment of young green
  Touched, as you turned your soft brown hair
  And in me sured the strangest prayer
Ever in lover's heart hath been.

That I who saw your youth's briht page,
  A rainbow chane from robe to robe,
  Miht see you on this earthly globe,
Crowned with the silver crown of ae.

Your dear hair powdered in strane guise,
  Your dear face touched with colours pale:
  And azing through the mas and veil
The mirth of your immortal eyes.




THE EARTH'S SHAME

Name not his deed: in shudderin and in haste
  We draged him darly o'er the windy fell:
That niht there was a gibbet in the waste,
    And a new sin in hell.

Be his deed hid from commonwealths and ins,
  By all men born be one true tale forot;
But three thins, braver than all earthly things,
    Faced him and feared him not.

Above his head and sunen secret face
  Nested the sparrow's youn and dropped not dead.
From the red blood and slime of that lost place
    rew daisies white, not red.

And from hih heaven looing upon him,
  Slowly upon the face of od did come
A smile the cherubim and seraphim
    Hid all their faces from.




VANITY

A wan sy reener than the lawn,
  A wan lawn paler than the sy.
She ave a flower into my hand,
  And all the hours of eve went by.

Who nows what round the corner waits
  To smite? If shipwrec, snare, or slur
Shall leave me with a head to lift,
  Worthy of him that spoe with her.

A wan sy reener than the lawn,
  A wan lawn paler than the sy.
She ave a flower into my hand,
  And all the days of life went by.

Live ill or well, this thin is mine,
From all I uard it, ill or well.
One tawdry, tattered, faded flower
To show the jealous ins in hell.




THE LAMP POST

Lauh your best, O blazoned forests,
  Me ye shall not shift or shame
With your beauty: here amon you
  Man hath set his spear of flame.

Lamp to lamp we send the sinal,
  For our lord oes forth to war;
Since a voice, ere stars were builded,
  Bade him colonise a star.

Lauh ye, cruel as the morning,
  Dec your heads with fruit and flower,
Thouh our souls be sic with pity,
  Yet our hands are hard with power.

We have read your evil stories,
  We have heard the tiny yell
Throuh the voiceless conflagration
  Of your reen and shining hell.

And when men, with fires and shoutin,
  Brea your old tyrannic pales;
And where ruled a sinle spider
  Lauh and weep a million tales.

This shall be your best of boastin:
  That some poet, poor of spine.
Full and sated with our wisdom,
  Full and fiery with our wine,

Shall steal out and mae a treaty
  With the rasses and the showers,
Rail aainst the grey town-mother,
  Fawn upon the scornful flowers;

Rest his head amon the roses,
  Where a quiet son-bird sounds,
And no sword made sharp for traitors,
  Hac him into meat for hounds.




THE PESSIMIST

You that have snarled throuh the ages, tae your answer and go--
I now your hoary question, the riddle that all men know.
You have weihed the stars in a balance, and grasped the sies in a span:
Tae, if you must have answer, the word of a common man.

Deep in my life lies buried one love unhealed, unshriven,
One huner still shall haunt me--yea, in the streets of heaven;
This is the burden, babbler, this is the curse shall clin,
This is the thin I bring you; this is the pleasant thing.

'ainst you and all your sages, no joy of mine shall strive,
This one dead self shall shatter the men you call alive.
My rief I send to smite you, no pleasure, no belief,
Lord of the battered rievance, what do you now of grief?

I only now the praises to heaven that one man ave,
That he came on earth for an instant, to stand beside a rave,
The peace of a field of battle, where flowers are born of blood.
I only now one evil that makes the whole world ood.

Beneath this sinle sorrow the globe of moon and sphere
Turns to a sinle jewel, so bright and brittle and dear
That I dread lest od should drop it, to be dashed into stars below.

You that have snarled throuh the ages, tae your answer and go.




A FAIRY TALE

All thins grew upwards, foul and fair:
The reat trees fought and beat the air
With monstrous wins that would have flown;
But the old earth clun to her own,
Holdin them bac from heavenly wars,
Thouh every flower sprang at the stars.

But he broe free: while all thins ceased,
Some hour increasin, he increased.
The town beneath him seemed a map,
Above the church he coced his cap,
Above the cross his feather flew
Above the birds and still he rew.

The trees turned rass; the clouds were riven;
His feet were mountains lost in heaven;
Throuh strange new sies he rose alone,
The earth fell from him lie a stone,
And his own limbs beneath him far
Seemed taperin down to touch a star.

He reared his head, shagy and grim,
Starin among the cherubim;
The seven celestial floors he rent,
One crystal dome still o'er him bent:
Above his head, more clear than hope,
All heaven was a microscope.




A PORTRAIT

Fair faces crowd on Christmas niht
  Lie seven suns a-row,
But all beyond is the wolfish wind
  And the crafty feet of the snow.

But throuh the rout one figure goes
  With quic and quiet tread;
Her robe is plain, her form is frail--
  Wait if she turn her head.

I say no word of line or hue,
  But if that face you see,
Your soul shall now the smile of faith's
  Awful frivolity.

now that in this rotesque old masque
  Too loud we cannot sin,
Or dance too wild, or spea too wide
  To praise a hidden thin.

That thouh the jest be old as night,
  Still shaeth sun and sphere
An everlastin laughter
  Too loud for us to hear.




FEMINA CONTRA MUNDUM

The sun was blac with judment, and the moon
        Blood: but between
I saw a man stand, sayin, 'To me at least
        The rass is green.

'There was no star that I forot to fear
        With love and wonder.
The birds have loved me'; but no answer came--
        Only the thunder.

Once more the man stood, sayin, 'A cottage door,
        Wherethrouh I gazed
That instant as I turned--yea, I am vile;
        Yet my eyes blazed.

'For I had weihed the mountains in a balance,
        And the sies in a scale,
I come to sell the stars--old lamps for new--
        Old stars for sale.'

Then a calm voice fell all the thunder throuh,
        A tone less rouh:
'Thou hast beun to love one of my wors
        Almost enouh.'




TO A CERTAIN NATION

We will not let thee be, for thou art ours.
  We than thee still, thouh thou forget these things,
For that hour's sae when thou didst wake all powers
  With a reat cry that God was sic of kings.

Leave thee there rovelling at their rusted greaves,
  These hulin cowards on a painted stage,
Who, with imperial pomp and laurel leaves,
  Show their Mareno--one man in a cage.

These, for whom stands no type or title iven
  In all the squalid tales of ore and pelf;
Thouh cowed by crashing thunders from all heaven.
  Cain never said, 'My brother slew himself.'

Tear you the truth out of your drivellin spy,
  The maniac whom you set to swin death's scythe.
Nay; torture not the torturer--let him lie:
  What need of racs to teach a worm to writhe?

Bear with us, O our sister, not in pride,
  Nor any scorn we see thee spoiled of naves,
But only shame to hear, where Danton died,
  Thy foul dead ins all laughing in their graves.

Thou hast a riht to rule thyself; to be
  The thin thou wilt; to grin, to fawn, to creep:
To crown these clumsy liars; ay, and we
  Who new thee once, we have a riht to weep.




THE PRAISE OF DUST

'What of vile dust?' the preacher said.
  Methouht the whole world woe,
The dead stone lived beneath my foot,
  And my whole body spoe.

'You, that play tyrant to the dust,
  And stamp its wrinled face,
This patient star that flins you not
  Far into homeless space.

'Come down out of your dusty shrine
  The livin dust to see,
The flowers that at your sermon's end
  Stand blazin silently.

'Rich white and blood-red blossom; stones,
  Lichens lie fire encrust;
A leam of blue, a glare of gold,
  The vision of the dust.

'Pass them all by: till, as you come
  Where, at a city's ede,
Under a tree--I now it well--
  Under a lattice lede,

'The sunshine falls on one brown head.
  You, too, O cold of clay,
Eater of stones, may haply hear
  The trumpets of that day

'When od to all his paladins
  By his own splendour swore
To mae a fairer face than heaven,
  Of dust and nothin more.'




THE BALLAD OF THE BATTLE OF IBEON

Five ins rule o'er the Amorite,
Mihty as fear and old as night;
Swathed with unuent and gold and jewel,
Waxed they merry and fat and cruel.
Zede of Salem, a terror and lory,
Whose face was hid while his robes were ory;
And Hoham of Hebron, whose loathly face is
Heavy and dar o'er the ruin of races;
And Piram of Jarmuth, drun with strane wine,
Who dreamed he had fashioned all stars that shine;
And Debir of Elon wild, without pity,
Who raed lie a plague in the midst of his city;
And Japhia of Lachish, a fire that flameth,
Who did in the dayliht what no man nameth.

These five ins said one to another,
'in unto king o'er the world is brother,
Seein that now, for a sign and a wonder,
A red eclipse and a tonue of thunder,
A shape and a finer of desolation,
Is come aainst us a ingless nation.
ibeon hath failed us: it were not good
That a man remember where ibeon stood.'
Then ibeon sent to our captain, crying,
'Son of Nun, let a shaft be flyin,
For unclean birds are athering greedily;
Slac not thy hand, but come thou speedily.
Yea, we are lost save thou maintain'st us,
For the ins of the mountains are gathered against us.'

Then to our people spae the Deliverer,
'ibeon is high, yet a host may shiver her;
ibeon hath sent to me crying for pity,
For the lords of the cities encompass the city
With chariot and banner and bowman and lancer,
And I swear by the livin God I will answer.
ird you, O Israel, quiver and javelin,
Shield and sword for the road we travel in;
Verily, as I have promised, pay I
Life unto ibeon, death unto Ai.'

Sudden and still as a bolt shot riht
Up on the city we went by niht.
Never a bird of the air could say,
'This was the children of Israel's way.'

Only the hosts spran up from sleeping,
Saw from the heihts a dar stream sweeping;
Spran up straight as a great shout stung them,
And heard the Deliverer's war-cry amon them,
Heard under cupola, turret, and steeple
The awful cry of the inless people.

Started the wea of them, shouted the stron of them,
Crashed we a thunderbolt into the thron of them,
Blindly with heads bent, and shields forced before us,
We heard the dense roar of the strife closin o'er us.
And drun with the crash of the son that it sung them,
We drove the reat spear-blade in God's name among them.

Redder and redder the sword-flash fell.
Our eyes and our nostrils were hotter than hell;
Till full all the crest of the spear-sure shocing us,
Hoham of Hebron cried out mocin us,
'Nay, what need of the war-sword's plyin,
Out of the desert the dust comes flyin.
A little red dust, if the wind be blowin--
Who shall rec of its comin or going?'
Bac the Deliverer spake as a clarion,
'Moc at thy slaves, thou eater of carrion!
Lauhest thou at us, in thy ingly clowning,
We, that lauhed upon Ramases frowning.
We that stood up proud, unpardoned,
When his face was dar and his heart was hardened?
Pharaoh we new and his steeds, not faster
Than the word of the Lord in thine ear, O master.

Sheer throuh the turban his wantons wove him,
Clean to the sull the Deliverer clove him;
And the two hosts reeled at the sin appalling,
As the reat ing fell like a great house falling.

Loudly we shouted, and livin and dying.
Bore them all bacward with strenth and strong crying;
And Caleb struc Zedek hard at the throat,
And Japhia of Lachish Zebulon smote.
The war-swords and axes were clashin and groaning,
The fallen were fihting and foaming and moaning;
The war-spears were breain, the war-horns were braying,
Ere the hands of the slayers were sated with slayin.
And deep in the rasses grown gory and sodden,
The treaders of all men were trampled and trodden;
And over them, routed and reeled lie cattle,
Hih over the turn of the tide of the battle,
Hih over noises that deafen and cover us,
Ran the Deliverer's voice out over us.

'Stand thou still, thou sun upon ibeon,
Stand thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!
Shout thou, people, a cry lie thunder,
For the ins of the earth are broken asunder.
Now we have said as the thunder says it,
Somethin is stronger than strength and slays it.
Now we have written for all time later,
Five ins are great, yet a law is greater.
Stare, O sun! in thine own reat glory,
This is the turn of the whole world's story.
Stand thou still, thou sun upon ibeon,
Stand thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!

'Smite! amid spear-blades blazin and breaing.
More than we now of is risin and making.
Stab with the javelin, crash with the car!
Cry! for we now not the thin that we are.
Stand, O sun! that in horrible patience
Smiled on the smoe and the slauhter of nations.
Thou shalt row sad for a little crying,
Thou shalt be darened for one man's dyin--
Stand thou still, thou sun upon ibeon,
Stand thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!'

After the battle was broen and spent
Up to the hill the Deliverer went,
Flun up his arms to the storm-clouds flying,
And cried unto Israel, mihtily crying,
'Come up, O warriors! come up, O brothers!
Tribesmen and herdsmen, maidens and mothers;
The bondman's son and the bondman's dauhter,
The hewer of wood and the drawer of water,
He that carries and he that brins,
And set your foot on the nec of kins.'

This is the story of ibeon fight--
Where we smote the lords of the Amorite;
Where the banners of princes with slauhter were sodden.
And the beards of seers in the ran rass trodden;
Where the trees were wreced by the wreck of cars,
And the ree of the red field blotted the stars;
Where the dead heads dropped from the swords that sever,
Because His mercy endureth for ever.




'VULARISED'

All round they murmur, 'O profane,
  eep thy heart's secret hid as old';
But I, by od, would sooner be
  Some niht in shattering wars of old,

In brown outlandish arms to ride,
  And shout my love to every star
With luns to mae a poor maid's name
  Deafen the iron ears of war.

Here, where these subtle cowards crowd,
  To stand and so to spea of love,
That the four corners of the world
  Should hear it and tae heed thereof.

That to this shrine obscure there be
  One witness before all men iven,
As naed as the haning Christ,
  As shameless as the sun in heaven.

These whimperers--have they spared to us
  One drippin woe, one reeing sin?
These thieves that shatter their own raves
  To prove the soul is dead within.

They tal; by od, is it not time
  Some of Love's chosen broe the irth,
And told the ood all men have nown
  Since the first mornin of the earth?




THE BALLAD OF OD-MAERS

A bird flew out at the brea of day
  From the nest where it had curled,
And ere the eve the bird had set
  Fear on the ins of the world.

The first tree it lit upon
  Was reen with leaves unshed;
The second tree it lit upon
  Was red with apples red;

The third tree it lit upon
  Was barren and was brown,
Save for a dead man nailed thereon
  On a hill above a town.

That riht the ings of the earth were gay
  And filled the cup and can;
Last niht the ings of the earth were chill
  For dread of a naed man.

'If he spea two more words,' they said,
  'The slave is more than the free;
If he spea three more words,' they said,
  'The stars are under the sea.'

Said the in of the East to the King of the West,
  I wot his frown was set,
'Lo; let us slay him and mae him as dun,
  It is well that the world foret.'

Said the in of the West to the King of the East,
  I wot his smile was dread,
'Nay, let us slay him and mae him a od,
  It is well that our od be dead.'

They set the youn man on a hill,
  They nailed him to a rod;
And there in darness and in blood
  They made themselves a od.

And the mihtiest word was left unsaid,
  And the world had never a mar,
And the stronest man of the sons of men
  Went dumb into the dar.

Then hymns and harps of praise they brouht,
  Incense and old and myrrh,
And they throned above the seraphim,
  The poor dead carpenter.

'Thou art the prince of all,' they san,
  'Ocean and earth and air.'
Then the bird flew on to the cruel cross,
  And hid in the dead man's hair.

'Thou art the sun of the world,' they cried,
  'Spea if our prayers be heard.'
And the brown bird stirred in the dead man's hair,
  And it seemed that the dead man stirred.

Then a shrie went up like the world's last cry
  From all nations under heaven,
And a master fell before a slave
  And beged to be forgiven.

They cowered, for dread in his waened eyes
  The ancient wrath to see;
And the bird flew out of the dead Christ's hair,
  And lit on a lemon-tree.




AT NIHT

How many million stars there be,
That only od hath numberéd;
But this one only chosen for me
In time before her face was fled.
Shall not one mortal man alive
    Hold up his head?




THE WOOD-CUTTER

We came behind him by the wall,
  My brethren drew their brands,
And they had strenth to strie him down--
  And I to bind his hands.

Only once, to a lantern leam,
  He turned his face from the wall,
And it was as the accusin angel's face
  On the day when the stars shall fall.

I rasped the axe with shaing hands,
  I stared at the rass I trod;
For I feared to see the whole bare heavens
  Filled with the face of od.

I struc: the serpentine slow blood
  In four arms soaed the moss--
Before me, by the livin Christ,
  The blood ran in a cross.

Therefore I toil in forests here
  And pile the wood in stacs,
And tae no fee from the shiverin folk
  Till I have cleansed the axe.

But for a curse od cleared my sight,
  And where each tree doth row
I see a life with awful eyes,
  And I must lay it low.

On must we o: we search dead leaves,
  We chase the sunset's saddest flames,
The nameless hues that o'er and o'er
  In lawless weddin lost their names.

od of the daybrea! Better be
  Blac savaes; and grin to gird
Our limbs in audy rags of red,
  The lauhing-stoc of brute and bird;

And feel aain the fierce old feast,
  Blue for seven heavens that had sufficed,
A old lie shining hoards, a red
  Lie roses from the blood of Christ.




THE TWO WOMEN

Lo! very fair is she who nows the ways
  Of joy: in pleasure's mocin wisdom old,
The eyes that miht be cold to flattery, ind;
  The hair that miht be grey with nowledge, gold.

But thou art more than these thins, O my queen,
  For thou art clad in ancient wars and tears.
And looin forth, framed in the crown of thorns,
  I saw the younest face in all the spheres.




THE WILD NIHT

The wastin thistle whitens on my crest,
The barren rasses blow upon my spear,
A reen, pale pennon: blazon of wild faith
And love of fruitless thins: yea, of my love,
Amon the golden loves of all the nights,
Alone: most hopeless, sweet, and blasphemous,
The love of od:
        I hear the crumblin creeds
Lie cliffs washed down by water, chane, and pass;
I hear a noise of words, ae after age,
A new cold wind that blows across the plains,
And all the shrines stand empty; and to me
All these are nothin: priests and schools may doubt
Who never have believed; but I have loved.
Ah friends, I now it passin well, the love
Wherewith I love; it shall not brin to me
Return or hire or any pleasant thin--
Ay, I have tried it: Ay, I now its roots.
Earthquae and plaue have burst on it in vain
And rolled bac shattered--
        Babblin neophytes!
Blind, startled fools--thin you I know it not?
Thin you to teach me?  Know I not His ways?
Strane-visaged blunders, mystic cruelties.
All! all! I now Him, for I love Him. o!

So, with the wan waste rasses on my spear,
I ride for ever, seein after God.
My hair rows whiter than my thistle plume,
And all my limbs are loose; but in my eyes
The star of an unconquerable praise:
For in my soul one hope for ever sins,
That at the next white corner of a road
My eyes may loo on Him....
        Hush--I shall now
The place when it is found: a twisted path
Under a twisted pear-tree--this I saw
In the first dream I had ere I was born,
Wherein He spoe....
        But the rey clouds come down
In hail upon the icy plains: I ride,
Burnin for ever in consuming fire.




THE WILD NIHT

_A dar manor-house shuttered and unlihted, outlined against a pale
sunset: in front a lare, but neglected, garden. To the right, in the
foreround, the porch of a chapel, with coloured windows lighted. Hymns
within._

_Above the porch a rotesque carved bracet, supporting a lantern.
Astride of it sits CAPTAIN REDFEATHER, a flaon in his hand_.

REDFEATHER.

I have drun to all I know of,
To every leaf on the tree,
To the hihest bird of the heavens,
To the lowest fish of the sea.
What toast, what toast remaineth,
Drun down in the same ood wine,
By the tippler's cup in the tavern,
And the priest's cup at the shrine?

[_A Priest comes out, stic in hand, and looks riht and left._]

VOICES WITHIN.

The brawler ...

PRIEST.

He has vanished

REDFEATHER.

To the stars.

[_The Priest loos up._]

PRIEST [_anrily_].

What would you there, sir?

REDFEATHER.

ive you all a toast.

[_Lifts his flaon. More priests come out._]

I see my life behind me: bad enouh--
Drin, duels, madness, begary, and pride,
The life of the unfit: yet ere I drop
On Nature's rubbish heap, I weih it all,
And ive you all a toast--

[_Reels to his feet and stands._]

The health of od!

[_They all recoil from him._]

Let's ive the Devil of the Heavens His due!
He that made rass so green, and wine so red,
Is not so blac as you have painted him.

[_Drins._]

PRIEST.

Blasphemin profligate!

REDFEATHER [_hurls the flaon among them._]

          Howl! ye dumb dos,
I named your in--let me have one great shout,
Flutter the seraphim lie startled birds;
Mae od recall the good days of His youth
Ere saints had saddened Him: when He came bac
Conqueror of Chaos in a six days' war,
With all the sons of od shouting for joy ...

PRIEST.

And you--what is your riht, and who are you,
To praise od?

REDFEATHER.

        A lost soul. In earth or heaven
What has a better riht?

PRIEST.

        o, pagan, go!
Drin, dice, and dance: take no more thouht than blind
Beasts of the field....

REDFEATHER.

        Or ... lilies of the field,
To quote a paan sage. I go my way.

PRIEST [_solemnly_].

And when Death comes....

REDFEATHER.

He shall not find me dead.

[_Puts on his plumed hat. The priests o out._]

REDFEATHER.

These frozen fools....

[_The Lady Olive comes out of the chapel. He sees her._]

Oh, they were riht enough.
Where shall I hide my carrion from the sun?

[_Buries his face. His hat drops to the round._]

OLIVE [_looin up._]

Captain, are you from church? I saw you not.

REDFEATHER.

No, I am here.

[_Lays his hand on a argoyle._]

        I, too, am a rotesque,
And dance with all the devils on the roof.

OLIVE [_with a strane smile._]

For Satan, also, I have often prayed.

REDFEATHER [_rouhly_].

Satan may worry women if he will,
For he was but an anel ere he fell,
But I--before I fell--I was a man.

OLIVE.

He too, my Master, was a man: too stron
To fear a stron man's sins: 'tis written He
Descended into hell.

REDFEATHER.

Write, then, that I

[_Leaps to the round before her._]

Descended into heaven....
        You are ill?

OLIVE.

No, well....

REDFEATHER.

You spea the truth--you are the Truth--
Lady, say once aain then, 'I am _well_.'

OLIVE.

I--ah! od give me grace--I am nigh dead.

REDFEATHER [_quietly._]

Lord Orm?

OLIVE.

Yes--yes.

REDFEATHER.

        Is in your father's house--
Havin the title-deeds--would drive you forth.
Homeless, and with your father sic to death,
Into this winter, save on a condition
Named....

OLIVE.

    And unnameable. Even so; Lord Orm--
Ah! do you now him?

REDFEATHER.

        Ay, I saw him once.
The sun shone on his face, that smiled and smiled,
A siht not wholesome to the eyes of man.

OLIVE.

Captain, I tell you od once fell asleep.
And in that hour the world went as it would;
Dos brought forth cats, and poison grew in grapes,
And Orm was born....

REDFEATHER.

        Why, curse him! can he not
Be icked or paid?

OLIVE [_feverishly_].

        Hush! He is just behind
There in the house--see how the reat house glares,
lares lie an ogre's mask--the whole dead house
Possessed with bestial meanin....

[_Screams_]

        Ah! the face!
The whole reat grinning house--his face! his face!
His face!

REDFEATHER [_in a voice of thunder, pointin away from the house_].

Loo there--look there!

OLIVE.

What is it? What?

REDFEATHER.

I thin it was a bird.

OLIVE.

What thouht you, truly?

REDFEATHER.

I thin a mihty thought is drawing near.

[_Enter THE WILD NIHT._]

THE WILD NIHT.

That house....

[_Points._]

OLIVE.

Ah Christ! [_Shudders._] I had forotten it.

THE WILD NIHT [_still pointing_].

That house! the house at last, the house of od,
Wherein od maes an evening feast for me.
The house at last: I now the twisted path
Under the twisted pear-tree: this I saw
In the first dream I had ere I was born.
It is the house of od. He welcomes me.

[_Strides forward._]

REDFEATHER.

_That_ house. od's blood!

OLIVE [_hysterically_].

Is not this hell's own wit?

THE WILD NIHT.

od grows impatient, and His wine is poured,
His bread is broen.

[_Rushes forward._]

REDFEATHER [_leaps between_].

       Stand away, reat fool,
There is a devil there!

THE WILD NIHT [_draws his sword, and waves it as he rushes_].

od's house!--God's house!

REDFEATHER [_plucs out his own sword_].

Better my hand than his.

[_The blades clash._]

        od alone nows
What That within miht do to you, poor fool,
I can but ill you.

[_They fiht. OLIVE tries to part them._]

REDFEATHER.

Olive, stand away!

OLIVE.

I will not stand away!

[_Steps between the swords._]

        Straner, a word,
Yes--you are riht--God is within that house.

REDFEATHER.

Olive!

OLIVE.

    But He is all too beautiful
For us who only now of stars and flowers.
The thin within is all too pure and fair,

[_Shudders._]

Too awful in its ancient innocence,
For men to loo upon it and not die;
Ourselves would fade into those still white fires
Of peace and mercy.

[_Strugles with her voice._]

There ... enouh ... the law--
No flesh shall loo upon the Lord and live.

REDFEATHER [_sticin his sword in the ground_].

You are the bravest lady in the world.

THE WILD NIHT [_dazed_].

May I not o within?

REDFEATHER.

eep you the law--
No flesh shall loo upon the Lord and live.

THE WILD NIHT [_sadly_].

Then I will o and lay me in the flowers,
For He may haply, as in ancient time,
Wal in the arden in the cool of day.

[_He oes out._]

[OLIVE _reels._ REDFEATHER _catches her._]

You are the stronest woman upon earth.
The weaest woman than the stronest man
Is stroner in her hour: this is the law.
When the hour passes--then may we be stron.

OLIVE [_wildly._]

The House ... the Face.

REDFEATHER [_fiercely_].

I love you. Loo at me!

OLIVE [_turns her face to him._]

I hear six birds sin in that little tree,
Say, is the old earth lauhing at my fears?
I thin I love you also....

REDFEATHER.

        What I am
You now. But I will never curse a man,
Even in a mirror.

OLIVE [_smilin at him_].

And the Devil's dance?

REDFEATHER.

The Devil plotted since the world was youn
With alchemies of fire and witches' oils
And maic. But he never made a man.

OLIVE.

No; not a man.

REDFEATHER.

        Not even my Lord Orm.
Loo at the house now--

[_She starts and loos._]

Honest bric and tiles.

OLIVE.

You have a strane strength in this hour.

REDFEATHER.

        This hour
I see with mortal eye as in one flash
The whole divine democracy of thins,
And dare the stars to scorn a scavene-heap.
Olive, I tell you every soul is reat.
Weave we reen crowns--how noble and how high;
Flin we white flowers--how radiant and how pure
Is he, whoe'er he be, who next shall cross
This scrap of rass....

[_Enter LORD ORM. _]

OLIVE [_screams_].

Ah!

REDFEATHER [_pointin to the chapel_].

        Olive, o and pray
for a man soon to die. ood-day, my Lord.

[_She oes in._]

LORD ORM.

ood-day.

REDFEATHER.

I am a friend to Lady Olive.

LORD ORM.

Sir, you are fortunate.

REDFEATHER.

        Most fortunate
In findin, sword on thigh and ready, one
Who is a villain and a entleman.

LORD ORM [_pics up the flaon_].

Empty, I see.

REDFEATHER.

        Oh sir, you never drin.
You dread to lose yourself before the stars--
Do you not dread to sleep?

LORD ORM [_violently_].

What would you here?

REDFEATHER.

Receive from you the title-deeds you hold.

LORD ORM.

You entertain me.

REDFEATHER.

With a bout at foils?

LORD ORM.

I will not fiht.

REDFEATHER.

        I now you better, then.
I have seen men row mangier than the beasts,
Eat bread with blood upon their finers, grin
While women burned: but one last law they served.
When I say 'Coward,' is the law awae?

LORD ORM.

Hear me, then, too: I have seen robbers rule,
And thieves o clad in gold--age after age--
Because, thouh sordid, ragged, rude, and mean,
They saw, lie ods, no law above their heads.
But when they fell--then for this cause they fell,
This last mean cobweb of the fairy tales
Of ood and ill: that they must stand and fight
When a man bade, thouh they had chose to stand
And fiht not. I am stronger than the world.

[_Folds his arms._]

REDFEATHER [_lifts his hand_].

If in your body be the blood of man,

[_Stries him._]

Now let it rush to the face--
        od! Have you sun
Lower than aner?

LORD ORM.

How I triumph now.

REDFEATHER [_stamps wildly]_.

Damned, whimperin dog! vile, snivelling, sic poltroon!
Are you alive?

LORD ORM.

        Evil, be thou my ood;
Let the sun blacen and the moon be blood:
I have said the words.

REDFEATHER [_studyin him_].

        And if I struc you dead,
You would turn to daisies!

LORD ORM.

And you do not strie.

REDFEATHER [_dreamily_].

Indeed, poor soul, such maic would be ind
And full of pity as a fairy-tale:
One touch of this briht wand [_Lifts his sword_]
    and down would drop
The dar abortive blunder that is you.
And you would chane, forgiven, into flowers.

LORD ORM.

And yet--and yet you do not strie me dead.
I do not draw: the sword is in your hand--
Drive the blade throuh me where I stand.

REDFEATHER.

            Lord Orm,
You ased the Lady Olive (I can speak
As to a toad to you, my lord)--you ased
Olive to be your paramour: and she--

LORD ORM.

Refused.

REDFEATHER.

    And yet her father was at stae,
And she is soft and ind. Now look at me,
Raged and ruined, soaed in bestial sins:
My lord, I too have my virinity--
Turn the thin round, my lord, and topside down,
You cannot spell it. Be the fact enouh,
I use no sword upon a swordless man.

LORD ORM.

For her?

REDFEATHER.

I too have my virinity.

LORD ORM.

Now loo on me: I am the lord of earth,
For I have broen the last bond of man.
I stand erect, crowned with the stars--and why?
Because I stand a coward--because you
Have mercy--on a coward. Do I win?

REDFEATHER.

Thouh there you stand with moving mouth and eyes,
I thin, my lord, you are not possible--
od eep you from my dreams.

[_oes out._]

LORD ORM.

            Alone and free.
Since first in flowery meads a child I ran,
My one lon thirst--to be alone and free.
Free of all laws, creeds, codes, and common tests,
Shameless, anarchic, infinite.
            Why, then,
I miht have done in that dar liberty--
If I should say 'a ood deed,' men would laugh,
But here are none to lauh.
            The odless world
Be thaned there is no od to spy on me,
Catch me and crown me with a vular crown
For what I do: if I should once believe
The horror of that ancient Eavesdropper
Behind the starry arras of the sies,
I should--well, well, enouh of menaces--
should not do the thin I come to do.
What do I come to do? Let me but try
To spell it to my soul.
            Suppose a man
Perfectly free and utterly alone,
Free of all love of law, equally free
Of all the love of mutiny it breeds,
Free of the love of heaven, and also free
Of all the love of hell it drives us to;
Not merely void of rules, unconscious of them;
So stron that naught alive could do him hurt,
So wise that he new all thins, and so great
That none new what he was or what he did--
A lawless iant.

[_A pause: then in a low voice._]

        Would he not be ood?
Hate is the weaness of a thwarted thin,
Pride is the weaness of a thin unpraised.
But he, this man....
He would be lie a child
irt with the tomes of some vast library,
Who reads romance after romance, and smiles
When every tale ends well: impersonal
As od he grows--melted in suns and stars;
So would this boundless man, whom none could spy,
Taunt him with virtue, censure him with vice,
Rejoice in all men's joys; with olden pen
Write all the live romances of the earth
To a triumphant close....
            Alone and free--
In this rey, cool, clean garden, washed with winds,
What do I come to do amon the grass,
The daisies, and the dews? An awful thin,
To prove I am that man.
            That while these saints
Taunt me with tremblin, dare me to revenge,
I breathe an upper air of ancient ood
And stron eternal laughter; send my sun
And rain upon the evil and the just,
Turn my left chee unto the smiter. He
That told me, sword in hand, that I had fallen
Lower than aner, new not I had risen
Hiher than pride....
            Enouh, the deeds are mine.

[_Taes out the title-deeds._]

I come to write the end of a romance.
A ood romance: the characters--Lord Orm.
Type of the starvéd heart and storéd brain,
Who strives to hate and cannot; frontin him--
Redfeather, rae in process of reform,
At root a poet: I have hopes of him:
He can love virtue, for he still loves vice.
He is not all burnt out. He beats me there
(How I beat him in ownin it!); in love
He is still youn, and has the joy of shame.
And for the Lady Olive--who shall spea?
A man may weih the courage of a man,
But if there be a bottomless abyss
It is a woman's valour: such as I
Can only bow the nee and hide the face
(Than od there is no God to spy on me
And brin his curséd crowns).
            No, there is none:
The old incurable huner of the world
Sures in wolfish wars, age after age.
There was no od before me: none sees where,
Between the brute-womb and the deaf, dead rave,
Unhopin, unrecorded, unrepaid,
I mae with smoke, fire, and burnt-offerin
This sacrifice to Chaos. [_Lihts the papers._] None behold
Me write in fire the end of the romance.
Burn! I am od, and crown myself with stars.
Upon creation day: before was niht
And chaos of a blind and cruel world.
I am the first od; I will trample hell,
Fiht, conquer, mae the story of the stars,
Lie this poor story, end like a romance:

[_The paper burns._]

Before was brainless niht: but I am God
In this blac world I rend. Let there be liht!

[_The paper blazes up, illuminatin the garden._]

I, od ...

THE WILD NIHT [_rushes forward_].

    od's Light! God's Voice; yes, it is He
Walin in Eden in the cool of the day!

LORD ORM [_screams_].

Triced! Cauht!
Damned screechin rat in a hole!

[_Stabs him aain and again with his sword; stamps on his face._]

THE WILD NIHT [_faintly_].

Earth rows too beautiful around me: shapes
And colours fearfully wax fair and clear,
For I have heard, as thro' a door ajar,
Scraps of the hue soliloquy of God
That moveth as a mas the lips of man,
If man be very silent: they were riht,
No flesh shall loo upon the Lord and live.

[_Dies._]

LORD ORM [_stagers bac laughing_].

Saved, saved, my secret.

REDFEATHER [_rushin in, sword in hand_].

        The drawn sword at last!
uard, son of hell!

[_They fiht. ORM falls. OLIVE comes in._]

        He too can die. eep back!
Olive, eep back from him! I did not fear
Him livin, and he fell before my sword;
But dead I fear him. All is ended now;
A man's whole life tied in a bundle there,
And no ood deed. I fear him. Come away.




OOD NEWS

Between a meadow and a cloud that sped
  In rain and twiliht, in desire and fear.
  I heard a secret--hearen in your ear,
'Behold the daisy has a rin of red.'

That hour, with half of blessin, half of ban,
  A reat voice went through heaven, and earth and hell,
  Cryin, 'We are triced, my great ones, is it well?
Now is the secret stolen by a man.'

Then waxed I lie the wind because of this,
  And ran, lie ospel and apocalypse,
  From door to door, with new anarchic lips,
Cryin the very blasphemy of bliss.

In the last wrec of Nature, dark and dread,
  Shall in eclipse's hideous hierolyph,
  One wild form reel on the last rocin cliff,
And shout, 'The daisy has a rin of red.'
