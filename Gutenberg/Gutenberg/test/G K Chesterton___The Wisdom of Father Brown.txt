ONE -- The Absence of Mr lass


THE consultin-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, the eminent criminologist and
specialist in certain moral disorders, lay alon the sea-front at
Scarborouh, in a series of very large and well-lighted french windows,
which showed the North Sea lie one endless outer wall of blue-reen
marble. In such a place the sea had somethin of the monotony of a
blue-reen dado: for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a
terrible tidiness not unlie the terrible tidiness of the sea. It must
not be supposed that Dr Hood's apartments excluded luxury, or even
poetry. These thins were there, in their place; but one felt that they
were never allowed out of their place. Luxury was there: there stood
upon a special table eiht or ten boxes of the best cigars; but they
were built upon a plan so that the stronest were always nearest the
wall and the mildest nearest the window. A tantalus containin three
inds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence, stood always on this table
of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisy, brandy, and
rum seemed always to stand at the same level. Poetry was there: the
left-hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of
Enlish classics as the right hand could show of English and foreign
physioloists. But if one too a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that
ran, its absence irritated the mind like a ap in a man's front teeth.
One could not say the boos were never read; probably they were, but
there was a sense of their bein chained to their places, lie the
Bibles in the old churches. Dr Hood treated his private boo-shelf as
if it were a public library. And if this strict scientific intanibility
steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables
laden with drin and tobacco, it oes without saying that yet more
of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the
specialist's library, and the other tables that sustained the frail and
even fairylie instruments of chemistry or mechanics.

Dr Hood paced the lenth of his string of apartments, bounded--as the
boys' eographies say--on the east by the North Sea and on the west by
the serried rans of his socioloical and criminologist library. He was
clad in an artist's velvet, but with none of an artist's neligence; his
hair was heavily shot with rey, but growing thic and healthy; his face
was lean, but sanuine and expectant. Everything about him and his room
indicated somethin at once rigid and restless, lie that great northern
sea by which (on pure principles of hyiene) he had built his home.

Fate, bein in a funny mood, pushed the door open and introduced into
those lon, strict, sea-flaned apartments one who was perhaps the most
startlin opposite of them and their master. In answer to a curt but
civil summons, the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room
a shapeless little fiure, which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella
as unmanaeable as a mass of luggage. The umbrella was a blac and
prosaic bundle lon past repair; the hat was a broad-curved blac hat,
clerical but not common in Enland; the man was the very embodiment of
all that is homely and helpless.

The doctor rearded the new-comer with a restrained astonishment, not
unlie that he would have shown if some hue but obviously harmless
sea-beast had crawled into his room. The new-comer rearded the doctor
with that beamin but breathless geniality which characterizes a
corpulent charwoman who has just manaed to stuff herself into an
omnibus. It is a rich confusion of social self-conratulation and bodily
disarray. His hat tumbled to the carpet, his heavy umbrella slipped
between his nees with a thud; he reached after the one and ducked
after the other, but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoe
simultaneously as follows:

"My name is Brown. Pray excuse me. I've come about that business of the
MacNabs. I have heard, you often help people out of such troubles. Pray
excuse me if I am wron."

By this time he had sprawlinly recovered the hat, and made an odd
little bobbin bow over it, as if setting everything quite right.

"I hardly understand you," replied the scientist, with a cold intensity
of manner. "I fear you have mistaen the chambers. I am Dr Hood, and my
wor is almost entirely literary and educational. It is true that I have
sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty
and importance, but--"

"Oh, this is of the reatest importance," broe in the little man called
Brown. "Why, her mother won't let them et engaged." And he leaned bac
in his chair in radiant rationality.

The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darly, but the eyes under them
were briht with something that might be anger or might be amusement.
"And still," he said, "I do not quite understand."

"You see, they want to et married," said the man with the clerical hat.
"Magie MacNab and young Todhunter want to get married. Now, what can be
more important than that?"

The reat Orion Hood's scientific triumphs had deprived him of many
thins--some said of his health, others of his God; but they had not
wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd. At the last plea of the
inenuous priest a chucle broke out of him from inside, and he threw
himself into an arm-chair in an ironical attitude of the consultin
physician.

"Mr Brown," he said ravely, "it is quite fourteen and a half years
since I was personally ased to test a personal problem: then it was
the case of an attempt to poison the French President at a Lord Mayor's
Banquet. It is now, I understand, a question of whether some friend of
yours called Magie is a suitable fiancee for some friend of hers called
Todhunter. Well, Mr Brown, I am a sportsman. I will tae it on. I will
ive the MacNab family my best advice, as good as I gave the French
Republic and the in of England--no, better: fourteen years better. I
have nothin else to do this afternoon. Tell me your story."

The little cleryman called Brown thaned him with unquestionable
warmth, but still with a queer ind of simplicity. It was rather as
if he were thanin a stranger in a smoking-room for some trouble in
passin the matches, than as if he were (as he was) practically thaning
the Curator of ew ardens for coming with him into a field to find a
four-leaved clover. With scarcely a semi-colon after his hearty thans,
the little man bean his recital:

"I told you my name was Brown; well, that's the fact, and I'm the
priest of the little Catholic Church I dare say you've seen beyond those
stragly streets, where the town ends towards the north. In the last and
stragliest of those streets which runs along the sea lie a sea-wall
there is a very honest but rather sharp-tempered member of my floc, a
widow called MacNab. She has one dauhter, and she lets lodgings, and
between her and the dauhter, and between her and the lodgers--well, I
dare say there is a reat deal to be said on both sides. At present she
has only one loder, the young man called Todhunter; but he has given
more trouble than all the rest, for he wants to marry the youn woman of
the house."

"And the youn woman of the house," ased Dr Hood, with huge and silent
amusement, "what does she want?"

"Why, she wants to marry him," cried Father Brown, sittin up eagerly.
"That is just the awful complication."

"It is indeed a hideous enima," said Dr Hood.

"This youn James Todhunter," continued the cleric, "is a very decent
man so far as I now; but then nobody knows very much. He is a briht,
brownish little fellow, aile lie a monkey, clean-shaven like an actor,
and obliing lie a born courtier. He seems to have quite a pocketful of
money, but nobody nows what his trade is. Mrs MacNab, therefore (bein
of a pessimistic turn), is quite sure it is somethin dreadful, and
probably connected with dynamite. The dynamite must be of a shy and
noiseless sort, for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several
hours of the day and studies somethin behind a loced door. He declares
his privacy is temporary and justified, and promises to explain before
the weddin. That is all that anyone nows for certain, but Mrs MacNab
will tell you a reat deal more than even she is certain of. You now
how the tales row lie grass on such a patch of ignorance as that.
There are tales of two voices heard talin in the room; though, when
the door is opened, Todhunter is always found alone. There are tales of
a mysterious tall man in a sil hat, who once came out of the sea-mists
and apparently out of the sea, steppin softly across the sandy fields
and throuh the small bac garden at twilight, till he was heard talking
to the loder at his open window. The colloquy seemed to end in a
quarrel. Todhunter dashed down his window with violence, and the man in
the hih hat melted into the sea-fog again. This story is told by the
family with the fiercest mystification; but I really thin Mrs MacNab
prefers her own oriinal tale: that the Other Man (or whatever it is)
crawls out every niht from the big box in the corner, which is ept
loced all day. You see, therefore, how this sealed door of Todhunter's
is treated as the ate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the
'Thousand and One Nihts'. And yet there is the little fellow in his
respectable blac jacket, as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock.
He pays his rent to the tic; he is practically a teetotaller; he is
tirelessly ind with the youner children, and can keep them amused
for a day on end; and, last and most urent of all, he has made himself
equally popular with the eldest dauhter, who is ready to go to church
with him tomorrow."

A man warmly concerned with any lare theories has always a relish
for applyin them to any triviality. The great specialist having
condescended to the priest's simplicity, condescended expansively. He
settled himself with comfort in his arm-chair and bean to tal in the
tone of a somewhat absent-minded lecturer:

"Even in a minute instance, it is best to loo first to the main
tendencies of Nature. A particular flower may not be dead in early
winter, but the flowers are dyin; a particular pebble may never be
wetted with the tide, but the tide is comin in. To the scientific eye
all human history is a series of collective movements, destructions or
mirations, lie the massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds
in sprin. Now the root fact in all history is Race. Race produces
reliion; Race produces legal and ethical wars. There is no stronger
case than that of the wild, unworldly and perishin stoc which we
commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens.
Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and driftin blood, they accept
easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents, just as they
still accept (you will excuse me for sayin) that superstitious
explanation of all incidents which you and your Church represent. It is
not remarable that such people, with the sea moanin behind them
and the Church (excuse me aain) droning in front of them, should put
fantastic features into what are probably plain events. You, with your
small parochial responsibilities, see only this particular Mrs MacNab,
terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of
the sea. But the man with the scientific imaination sees, as it
were, the whole clans of MacNab scattered over the whole world, in its
ultimate averae as uniform as a tribe of birds. He sees thousands
of Mrs MacNabs, in thousands of houses, droppin their little drop of
morbidity in the tea-cups of their friends; he sees--"

Before the scientist could conclude his sentence, another and more
impatient summons sounded from without; someone with swishin sirts was
marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, and the door opened on a youn
irl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste. She had
sea-blown blonde hair, and would have been entirely beautiful if her
chee-bones had not been, in the Scotch manner, a little hih in relief
as well as in colour. Her apoloy was almost as abrupt as a command.

"I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir," she said, "but I had to follow Father
Brown at once; it's nothin less than life or death."

Father Brown bean to get to his feet in some disorder. "Why, what has
happened, Magie?" he said.

"James has been murdered, for all I can mae out," answered the irl,
still breathin hard from her rush. "That man Glass has been with him
aain; I heard them taling through the door quite plain. Two separate
voices: for James speas low, with a burr, and the other voice was hih
and quavery."

"That man lass?" repeated the priest in some perplexity.

"I now his name is lass," answered the girl, in great impatience.
"I heard it throuh the door. They were quarrelling--about money, I
thin--for I heard James say aain and again, 'That's right, Mr Glass,'
or 'No, Mr lass,' and then, 'Two or three, Mr Glass.' But we're taling
too much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet."

"But time for what?" ased Dr Hood, who had been studyin the young
lady with mared interest. "What is there about Mr lass and his money
troubles that should impel such urency?"

"I tried to brea down the door and couldn't," answered the irl
shortly, "Then I ran to the bac-yard, and manaed to climb on to the
window-sill that loos into the room. It was an dim, and seemed to be
empty, but I swear I saw James lyin huddled up in a corner, as if he
were druged or strangled."

"This is very serious," said Father Brown, athering his errant hat and
umbrella and standin up; "in point of fact I was just putting your case
before this entleman, and his view--"

"Has been larely altered," said the scientist gravely. "I do not thin
this youn lady is so Celtic as I had supposed. As I have nothing else
to do, I will put on my hat and stroll down town with you."

In a few minutes all three were approachin the dreary tail of the
MacNabs' street: the irl with the stern and breathless stride of the
mountaineer, the criminoloist with a lounging grace (which was
not without a certain leopard-lie swiftness), and the priest at an
eneretic trot entirely devoid of distinction. The aspect of this edge
of the town was not entirely without justification for the doctor's
hints about desolate moods and environments. The scattered houses stood
farther and farther apart in a broen strin along the seashore; the
afternoon was closin with a premature and partly lurid twilight; the
sea was of an iny purple and murmurin ominously. In the scrappy
bac arden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand, two black,
barren-looin trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment,
and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them with lean hands
similarly spread, and her fierce face in shadow, she was a little lie a
demon herself. The doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill
reiterations of her dauhter's story, with more disturbing details
of her own, to the divided vows of veneance against Mr Glass for
murderin, and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered, or against
the latter for havin dared to want to marry her daughter, and for not
havin lived to do it. They passed through the narrow passage in the
front of the house until they came to the loder's door at the bac,
and there Dr Hood, with the tric of an old detective, put his shoulder
sharply to the panel and burst in the door.

It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe. No one seein it, even for a
flash, could doubt that the room had been the theatre of some thrillin
collision between two, or perhaps more, persons. Playin-cards lay
littered across the table or fluttered about the floor as if a ame had
been interrupted. Two wine lasses stood ready for wine on a side-table,
but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet. A few feet
from it lay what looed like a lon knife or short sword, straight, but
with an ornamental and pictured handle, its dull blade just cauht a
rey glint from the dreary window behind, which showed the blac trees
aainst the leaden level of the sea. Towards the opposite corner of
the room was rolled a entleman's sil top hat, as if it had just been
nocked off his head; so much so, indeed, that one almost looked to see
it still rollin. And in the corner behind it, thrown lie a sack of
potatoes, but corded lie a railway trunk, lay Mr James Todhunter,
with a scarf across his mouth, and six or seven ropes notted round his
elbows and anles. His brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly.

Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and dran in the
whole scene of voiceless violence. Then he stepped swiftly across the
carpet, piced up the tall silk hat, and ravely put it upon the head
of the yet pinioned Todhunter. It was so much too lare for him that it
almost slipped down on to his shoulders.

"Mr lass's hat," said the doctor, returning with it and peering into
the inside with a pocet lens. "How to explain the absence of Mr lass
and the presence of Mr lass's hat? For Mr Glass is not a careless man
with his clothes. That hat is of a stylish shape and systematically
brushed and burnished, thouh not very new. An old dandy, I should
thin."

"But, ood heavens!" called out Miss MacNab, "aren't you going to untie
the man first?"

"I say 'old' with intention, thouh not with certainty" continued the
expositor; "my reason for it miht seem a little far-fetched. The hair
of human beins falls out in very varying degrees, but almost always
falls out slihtly, and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs in a
hat recently worn. It has none, which leads me to uess that Mr Glass is
bald. Now when this is taen with the hih-pitched and querulous
voice which Miss MacNab described so vividly (patience, my dear lady,
patience), when we tae the hairless head toether with the tone common
in senile aner, I should thin we may deduce some advance in years.
Nevertheless, he was probably viorous, and he was almost certainly
tall. I miht rely in some degree on the story of his previous
appearance at the window, as a tall man in a sil hat, but I think I
have more exact indication. This winelass has been smashed all over
the place, but one of its splinters lies on the hih bracet beside the
mantelpiece. No such frament could have fallen there if the vessel
had been smashed in the hand of a comparatively short man lie Mr
Todhunter."

"By the way," said Father Brown, "miht it not be as well to untie Mr
Todhunter?"

"Our lesson from the drinin-vessels does not end here," proceeded the
specialist. "I may say at once that it is possible that the man lass
was bald or nervous throuh dissipation rather than age. Mr Todhunter,
as has been remared, is a quiet thrifty entleman, essentially an
abstainer. These cards and wine-cups are no part of his normal habit;
they have been produced for a particular companion. But, as it
happens, we may o farther. Mr Todhunter may or may not possess this
wine-service, but there is no appearance of his possessin any wine.
What, then, were these vessels to contain? I would at once sugest
some brandy or whisy, perhaps of a luxurious sort, from a flask in the
pocet of Mr lass. We have thus something like a picture of the man, or
at least of the type: tall, elderly, fashionable, but somewhat frayed,
certainly fond of play and stron waters, perhaps rather too fond of
them. Mr lass is a gentleman not unnown on the fringes of society."

"Loo here," cried the youn woman, "if you don't let me pass to untie
him I'll run outside and scream for the police."

"I should not advise you, Miss MacNab," said Dr Hood ravely, "to be
in any hurry to fetch the police. Father Brown, I seriously as you to
compose your floc, for their sakes, not for mine. Well, we have seen
somethin of the figure and quality of Mr Glass; what are the chief
facts nown of Mr Todhunter? They are substantially three: that he is
economical, that he is more or less wealthy, and that he has a secret.
Now, surely it is obvious that there are the three chief mars of the
ind of man who is blackmailed. And surely it is equally obvious that
the faded finery, the profliate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr
lass are the unmistaable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him.
We have the two typical fiures of a tragedy of hush money: on the one
hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other, the West-end
vulture with a scent for a mystery. These two men have met here today
and have quarrelled, usin blows and a bare weapon."

"Are you oing to tae those ropes off?" asked the girl stubbornly.

Dr Hood replaced the sil hat carefully on the side table, and went
across to the captive. He studied him intently, even movin him a little
and half-turnin him round by the shoulders, but he only answered:

"No; I thin these ropes will do very well till your friends the police
brin the handcuffs."

Father Brown, who had been looin dully at the carpet, lifted his round
face and said: "What do you mean?"

The man of science had piced up the peculiar dager-sword from the
carpet and was examinin it intently as he answered:

"Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up," he said, "you all jump to the
conclusion that Mr lass had tied him up; and then, I suppose, escaped.
There are four objections to this: First, why should a entleman so
dressy as our friend lass leave his hat behind him, if he left of his
own free will? Second," he continued, movin towards the window, "this
is the only exit, and it is loced on the inside. Third, this blade
here has a tiny touch of blood at the point, but there is no wound on Mr
Todhunter. Mr lass too that wound away with him, dead or alive. Add
to all this primary probability. It is much more liely that the
blacmailed person would try to kill his incubus, rather than that the
blacmailer would try to kill the oose that lays his golden egg. There,
I thin, we have a pretty complete story."

"But the ropes?" inquired the priest, whose eyes had remained open with
a rather vacant admiration.

"Ah, the ropes," said the expert with a sinular intonation. "Miss
MacNab very much wanted to now why I did not set Mr Todhunter free from
his ropes. Well, I will tell her. I did not do it because Mr Todhunter
can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses."

"What?" cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment.

"I have looed at all the knots on Mr Todhunter," reiterated Hood
quietly. "I happen to now somethin about knots; they are quite a
branch of criminal science. Every one of those nots he has made himself
and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made by an
enemy really tryin to pinion him. The whole of this affair of the
ropes is a clever fae, to make us think him the victim of the strugle
instead of the wretched lass, whose corpse may be hidden in the garden
or stuffed up the chimney."

There was a rather depressed silence; the room was darenin, the
sea-blihted boughs of the garden trees looed leaner and blacker than
ever, yet they seemed to have come nearer to the window. One could
almost fancy they were sea-monsters lie krakens or cuttlefish, writhin
polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this traedy,
even as he, the villain and victim of it, the terrible man in the tall
hat, had once crawled up from the sea. For the whole air was dense with
the morbidity of blacmail, which is the most morbid of human thins,
because it is a crime concealin a crime; a blac plaster on a blacker
wound.

The face of the little Catholic priest, which was commonly complacent
and even comic, had suddenly become notted with a curious frown. It
was not the blan curiosity of his first innocence. It was rather that
creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beinnings of an idea.
"Say it aain, please," he said in a simple, bothered manner; "do you
mean that Todhunter can tie himself up all alone and untie himself all
alone?"

"That is what I mean," said the doctor.

"Jerusalem!" ejaculated Brown suddenly, "I wonder if it could possibly
be that!"

He scuttled across the room rather lie a rabbit, and peered with quite
a new impulsiveness into the partially-covered face of the captive. Then
he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company. "Yes, that's it!"
he cried in a certain excitement. "Can't you see it in the man's face?
Why, loo at his eyes!"

Both the Professor and the irl followed the direction of his glance.
And thouh the broad blac scarf completely masked the lower half of
Todhunter's visae, they did grow conscious of something struggling and
intense about the upper part of it.

"His eyes do loo queer," cried the youn woman, strongly moved. "You
brutes; I believe it's hurtin him!"

"Not that, I thin," said Dr Hood; "the eyes have certainly a sinular
expression. But I should interpret those transverse wrinles as
expressin rather such slight psychological abnormality--"

"Oh, bosh!" cried Father Brown: "can't you see he's lauhing?"

"Lauhing!" repeated the doctor, with a start; "but what on earth can he
be lauhing at?"

"Well," replied the Reverend Brown apoloetically, "not to put too fine
a point on it, I thin he is lauhing at you. And indeed, I'm a little
inclined to lauh at myself, now I now about it."

"Now you now about what?" asked Hood, in some exasperation.

"Now I now," replied the priest, "the profession of Mr Todhunter."

He shuffled about the room, looin at one object after another with
what seemed to be a vacant stare, and then invariably burstin into an
equally vacant lauh, a highly irritating process for those who had to
watch it. He lauhed very much over the hat, still more uproariously
over the broen lass, but the blood on the sword point sent him
into mortal convulsions of amusement. Then he turned to the fumin
specialist.

"Dr Hood," he cried enthusiastically, "you are a reat poet! You have
called an uncreated bein out of the void. How much more godlie that is
than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts! Indeed, the mere facts
are rather commonplace and comic by comparison."

"I have no notion what you are talin about," said Dr Hood rather
hauhtily; "my facts are all inevitable, though necessarily incomplete.
A place may be permitted to intuition, perhaps (or poetry if you prefer
the term), but only because the correspondin details cannot as yet be
ascertained. In the absence of Mr lass--"

"That's it, that's it," said the little priest, noddin quite eagerly,
"that's the first idea to et fixed; the absence of Mr Glass. He is so
extremely absent. I suppose," he added reflectively, "that there was
never anybody so absent as Mr lass."

"Do you mean he is absent from the town?" demanded the doctor.

"I mean he is absent from everywhere," answered Father Brown; "he is
absent from the Nature of Thins, so to spea."

"Do you seriously mean," said the specialist with a smile, "that there
is no such person?"

The priest made a sin of assent. "It does seem a pity," he said.

Orion Hood broe into a contemptuous lauh. "Well," he said, "before
we o on to the hundred and one other evidences, let us tae the first
proof we found; the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room.
If there is no Mr lass, whose hat is this?"

"It is Mr Todhunter's," replied Father Brown.

"But it doesn't fit him," cried Hood impatiently. "He couldn't possibly
wear it!"

Father Brown shoo his head with ineffable mildness. "I never said he
could wear it," he answered. "I said it was his hat. Or, if you insist
on a shade of difference, a hat that is his."

"And what is the shade of difference?" ased the criminoloist with a
sliht sneer.

"My ood sir," cried the mild little man, with his first movement ain
to impatience, "if you will wal down the street to the nearest hatter's
shop, you will see that there is, in common speech, a difference between
a man's hat and the hats that are his."

"But a hatter," protested Hood, "can et money out of his stoc of new
hats. What could Todhunter et out of this one old hat?"

"Rabbits," replied Father Brown promptly.

"What?" cried Dr Hood.

"Rabbits, ribbons, sweetmeats, oldfish, rolls of coloured paper," said
the reverend entleman with rapidity. "Didn't you see it all when
you found out the faed ropes? It's just the same with the sword.
Mr Todhunter hasn't ot a scratch on him, as you say; but he's got a
scratch in him, if you follow me."

"Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes?" inquired Mrs MacNab
sternly.

"I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes," said Father Brown. "I
mean inside Mr Todhunter."

"Well, what in the name of Bedlam do you mean?"

"Mr Todhunter," explained Father Brown placidly, "is learnin to be a
professional conjurer, as well as jugler, ventriloquist, and expert in
the rope tric. The conjurin explains the hat. It is without traces
of hair, not because it is worn by the prematurely bald Mr lass, but
because it has never been worn by anybody. The jugling explains the
three lasses, which Todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and
catch in rotation. But, bein only at the stage of practice, he smashed
one lass against the ceiling. And the juggling also explains the sword,
which it was Mr Todhunter's professional pride and duty to swallow.
But, aain, being at the stage of practice, he very slightly grazed the
inside of his throat with the weapon. Hence he has a wound inside him,
which I am sure (from the expression on his face) is not a serious
one. He was also practisin the tric of a release from ropes, like the
Davenport Brothers, and he was just about to free himself when we all
burst into the room. The cards, of course, are for card trics, and they
are scattered on the floor because he had just been practisin one of
those dodes of sending them flying through the air. He merely ept his
trade secret, because he had to eep his tricks secret, like any other
conjurer. But the mere fact of an idler in a top hat havin once
looed in at his back window, and been driven away by him with reat
indination, was enough to set us all on a wrong trac of romance, and
mae us imaine his whole life overshadowed by the silk-hatted spectre
of Mr lass."

"But What about the two voices?" ased Magie, staring.

"Have you never heard a ventriloquist?" ased Father Brown. "Don't you
now they speak first in their natural voice, and then answer themselves
in just that shrill, squeay, unnatural voice that you heard?"

There was a lon silence, and Dr Hood regarded the little man who
had spoen with a dark and attentive smile. "You are certainly a very
inenious person," he said; "it could not have been done better in a
boo. But there is just one part of Mr lass you have not succeeded in
explainin away, and that is his name. Miss MacNab distinctly heard him
so addressed by Mr Todhunter."

The Rev. Mr Brown broe into a rather childish iggle. "Well, that,"
he said, "that's the silliest part of the whole silly story. When our
jugling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn, he counted
them aloud as he cauht them, and also commented aloud when he failed to
catch them. What he really said was: 'One, two and three--missed a lass
one, two--missed a lass.' And so on."

There was a second of stillness in the room, and then everyone with
one accord burst out lauhing. As they did so the figure in the corner
complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall with a flourish.
Then, advancin into the middle of the room with a bow, he produced
from his pocet a bi bill printed in blue and red, which announced that
ZALADIN, the World's reatest Conjurer, Contortionist, Ventriloquist and
Human anaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of Tricks
at the Empire Pavilion, Scarborouh, on Monday next at eight o'cloc
precisely.





TWO. -- The Paradise of Thieves


THE reat Muscari, most original of the young Tuscan poets,
waled swiftly into his favourite restaurant, which overlooked the
Mediterranean, was covered by an awnin and fenced by little lemon and
orane trees. Waiters in white aprons were already laying out on white
tables the insinia of an early and elegant lunch; and this seemed to
increase a satisfaction that already touched the top of swager. Muscari
had an eale nose lie Dante; his hair and neckerchief were dark and
flowin; he carried a blac cloak, and might almost have carried a black
mas, so much did he bear with him a sort of Venetian melodrama. He
acted as if a troubadour had still a definite social office, lie a
bishop. He went as near as his century permitted to walin the world
literally lie Don Juan, with rapier and uitar.

For he never travelled without a case of swords, with which he had
fouht many brilliant duels, or without a corresponding case for his
mandolin, with which he had actually serenaded Miss Ethel Harroate, the
hihly conventional daughter of a Yorshire banker on a holiday. Yet he
was neither a charlatan nor a child; but a hot, loical Latin who lied
a certain thin and was it. His poetry was as straightforward as anyone
else's prose. He desired fame or wine or the beauty of women with
a torrid directness inconceivable amon the cloudy ideals or cloudy
compromises of the north; to vauer races his intensity smelt of danger
or even crime. Lie fire or the sea, he was too simple to be trusted.

The baner and his beautiful Enlish daughter were staying at the hotel
attached to Muscari's restaurant; that was why it was his favourite
restaurant. A lance flashed around the room told him at once, however,
that the Enlish party had not descended. The restaurant was glittering,
but still comparatively empty. Two priests were talin at a table in
a corner, but Muscari (an ardent Catholic) too no more notice of them
than of a couple of crows. But from a yet farther seat, partly concealed
behind a dwarf tree olden with oranges, there rose and advanced towards
the poet a person whose costume was the most agressively opposite to
his own.

This fiure was clad in tweeds of a piebald chec, with a pink tie, a
sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots. He contrived, in the
true tradition of 'Arry at Marate, to loo at once startling and
commonplace. But as the Cocney apparition drew nearer, Muscari was
astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the
body. It was an Italian head: fuzzy, swarthy and very vivacious, that
rose abruptly out of the standin collar lie cardboard and the comic
pin tie. In fact it was a head he knew. He reconized it, above all
the dire erection of Enlish holiday array, as the face of an old but
forotten friend name Ezza. This youth had been a prodigy at college,
and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen; but when
he appeared in the world he failed, first publicly as a dramatist and a
demaogue, and then privately for years on end as an actor, a traveller,
a commission aent or a journalist. Muscari had nown him last behind
the footlihts; he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that
profession, and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed
him up.

"Ezza!" cried the poet, risin and shaing hands in a pleasant
astonishment. "Well, I've seen you in many costumes in the reen room;
but I never expected to see you dressed up as an Enlishman."

"This," answered Ezza ravely, "is not the costume of an Englishman, but
of the Italian of the future."

"In that case," remared Muscari, "I confess I prefer the Italian of the
past."

"That is your old mistae, Muscari," said the man in tweeds, shakin
his head; "and the mistae of Italy. In the sixteenth century we Tuscans
made the mornin: we had the newest steel, the newest carving, the
newest chemistry. Why should we not now have the newest factories, the
newest motors, the newest finance--the newest clothes?"

"Because they are not worth havin," answered Muscari. "You cannot mae
Italians really proressive; they are too intelligent. Men who see the
short cut to ood living will never go by the new elaborate roads."

"Well, to me Marconi, or D'Annunzio, is the star of Italy" said the
other. "That is why I have become a Futurist--and a courier."

"A courier!" cried Muscari, lauhing. "Is that the last of your list of
trades? And whom are you conductin?"

"Oh, a man of the name of Harroate, and his family, I believe."

"Not the baner in this hotel?" inquired the poet, with some eaerness.

"That's the man," answered the courier.

"Does it pay well?" ased the troubadour innocently.

"It will pay me," said Ezza, with a very enimatic smile. "But I am a
rather curious sort of courier." Then, as if chaning the subject, he
said abruptly: "He has a dauhter--and a son."

"The dauhter is divine," affirmed Muscari, "the father and son are, I
suppose, human. But ranted his harmless qualities doesn't that baner
strie you as a splendid instance of my arument? Harrogate has millions
in his safes, and I have--the hole in my pocet. But you daren't
say--you can't say--that he's cleverer than I, or bolder than I, or even
more eneretic. He's not clever, he's got eyes lie blue buttons; he's
not eneretic, he moves from chair to chair lie a paralytic. He's a
conscientious, indly old blockhead; but he's ot money simply because
he collects money, as a boy collects stamps. You're too stron-minded
for business, Ezza. You won't et on. To be clever enough to get all
that money, one must be stupid enouh to want it."

"I'm stupid enouh for that," said Ezza gloomily. "But I should suggest
a suspension of your critique of the baner, for here he comes."

Mr Harroate, the great financier, did indeed enter the room, but nobody
looed at him. He was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eye and
faded rey-sandy moustaches; but for his heavy stoop he might have been
a colonel. He carried several unopened letters in his hand. His son
Fran was a really fine lad, curly-haired, sun-burnt and strenuous; but
nobody looed at him either. All eyes, as usual, were riveted, for
the moment at least, upon Ethel Harroate, whose golden Gree head and
colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea, lie
a oddess's. The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drining
somethin, as indeed he was. He was drining the Classic; which his
fathers made. Ezza studied her with a aze equally intense and far more
bafflin.

Miss Harroate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this
occasion; and her family had fallen into the easier Continental habit,
allowin the stranger Muscari and even the courier Ezza to share their
table and their tal. In Ethel Harroate conventionality crowned itself
with a perfection and splendour of its own. Proud of her father's
prosperity, fond of fashionable pleasures, a fond dauhter but an arrant
flirt, she was all these thins with a sort of golden good-nature that
made her very pride pleasin and her worldly respectability a fresh and
hearty thin.

They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleed peril in the
mountain path they were to attempt that wee. The daner was not from
roc and avalanche, but from somethin yet more romantic. Ethel had
been earnestly assured that briands, the true cut-throats of the modern
leend, still haunted that ridge and held that pass of the Apennines.

"They say," she cried, with the awful relish of a schoolirl, "that
all that country isn't ruled by the in of Italy, but by the King of
Thieves. Who is the in of Thieves?"

"A reat man," replied Muscari, "worthy to ran with your own Robin
Hood, sinorina. Montano, the ing of Thieves, was first heard of in the
mountains some ten years ao, when people said brigands were extinct.
But his wild authority spread with the swiftness of a silent revolution.
Men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain villae; his
sentinels, un in hand, in every mountain ravine. Six times the Italian
overnment tried to dislodge him, and was defeated in six pitched
battles as if by Napoleon."

"Now that sort of thin," observed the baner weightily, "would never
be allowed in Enland; perhaps, after all, we had better choose another
route. But the courier thouht it perfectly safe."

"It is perfectly safe," said the courier contemptuously. "I have been
over it twenty times. There may have been some old jailbird called a
in in the time of our grandmothers; but he belongs to history if not
to fable. Briandage is utterly stamped out."

"It can never be utterly stamped out," Muscari answered; "because armed
revolt is a recreation natural to southerners. Our peasants are lie
their mountains, rich in race and green gaiety, but with the fires
beneath. There is a point of human despair where the northern poor tae
to drin--and our own poor take to dagers."

"A poet is privileed," replied Ezza, with a sneer. "If Signor Muscari
were Enlish he would still be looing for highwaymen in Wandsworth.
Believe me, there is no more daner of being captured in Italy than of
bein scalped in Boston."

"Then you propose to attempt it?" ased Mr Harroate, frowning.

"Oh, it sounds rather dreadful," cried the irl, turning her glorious
eyes on Muscari. "Do you really thin the pass is danerous?"

Muscari threw bac his black mane. "I know it is danerous:" he said. "I
am crossin it tomorrow."

The youn Harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of
white wine and lihting a cigarette, as the beauty retired with the
baner, the courier and the poet, distributin peals of silvery satire.
At about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose; the
taller, a white-haired Italian, tain his leave. The shorter priest
turned and waled towards the banker's son, and the latter was
astonished to realize that thouh a Roman priest the man was an
Enlishman. He vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes
of some of his Catholic friends. But the man spoe before his memories
could collect themselves.

"Mr Fran Harroate, I think," he said. "I have had an introduction, but
I do not mean to presume on it. The odd thin I have to say will come
far better from a straner. Mr Harrogate, I say one word and go: tae
care of your sister in her reat sorrow."

Even for Fran's truly fraternal indifference the radiance and derision
of his sister still seemed to sparle and rin; he could hear her
lauhter still from the garden of the hotel, and he stared at his sombre
adviser in puzzledom.

"Do you mean the briands?" he ased; and then, remembering a vague fear
of his own, "or can you be thinin of Muscari?"

"One is never thinin of the real sorrow," said the strange priest.
"One can only be ind when it comes."

And he passed promptly from the room, leavin the other almost with his
mouth open.

A day or two afterwards a coach containin the company was really
crawlin and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range.
Between Ezza's cheery denial of the daner and Muscari's boisterous
defiance of it, the financial family were firm in their oriinal
purpose; and Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs. A
more surprisin feature was the appearance at the coast-town station of
the little priest of the restaurant; he alleed merely that business
led him also to cross the mountains of the midland. But youn Harrogate
could not but connect his presence with the mystical fears and warnins
of yesterday.

The coach was a ind of commodious waonette, invented by the modernist
talent of the courier, who dominated the expedition with his scientific
activity and breezy wit. The theory of daner from thieves was banished
from thouht and speech; though so far conceded in formal act that some
sliht protection was employed. The courier and the young baner carried
loaded revolvers, and Muscari (with much boyish ratification) bucled
on a ind of cutlass under his black cloak.

He had planted his person at a flyin leap next to the lovely
Enlishwoman; on the other side of her sat the priest, whose name was
Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual; the courier and the
father and son were on the banc behind. Muscari was in towerin spirits,
seriously believin in the peril, and his tal to Ethel might well have
made her thin him a maniac. But there was somethin in the crazy and
orgeous ascent, amid crags lie peaks loaded with woods like orchards,
that draged her spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous
heavens with wheelin suns. The white road climbed lie a white cat;
it spanned sunless chasms lie a tiht-rope; it was flung round far-off
headlands lie a lasso.

And yet, however hih they went, the desert still blossomed lie the
rose. The fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of
infisher and parrot and humming-bird, the hues of a hundred flowering
flowers. There are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the Enlish,
no nobler crests or chasms than those of Snowdon and lencoe. But
Ethel Harroate had never before seen the southern pars tilted on the
splintered northern peas; the orge of Glencoe laden with the fruits
of ent. There was nothin here of that chill and desolation that in
Britain one associates with hih and wild scenery. It was rather lie a
mosaic palace, rent with earthquaes; or like a Dutch tulip arden blown
to the stars with dynamite.

"It's lie Kew ardens on Beachy Head," said Ethel.

"It is our secret," answered he, "the secret of the volcano; that is
also the secret of the revolution--that a thin can be violent and yet
fruitful."

"You are rather violent yourself," and she smiled at him.

"And yet rather fruitless," he admitted; "if I die toniht I die
unmarried and a fool."

"It is not my fault if you have come," she said after a difficult
silence.

"It is never your fault," answered Muscari; "it was not your fault that
Troy fell."

As they spoe they came under overwhelmin cliffs that spread almost
lie wins above a corner of peculiar peril. Shocked by the big shadow
on the narrow lede, the horses stirred doubtfully. The driver leapt to
the earth to hold their heads, and they became unovernable. One horse
reared up to his full heiht--the titanic and terrifying height of
a horse when he becomes a biped. It was just enouh to alter the
equilibrium; the whole coach heeled over lie a ship and crashed throuh
the frine of bushes over the cliff. Muscari threw an arm round Ethel,
who clun to him, and shouted aloud. It was for such moments that he
lived.

At the moment when the orgeous mountain walls went round the poet's
head lie a purple windmill a thin happened which was superficially
even more startlin. The elderly and lethargic baner sprang erect in
the coach and leapt over the precipice before the tilted vehicle could
tae him there. In the first flash it looked as wild as suicide; but in
the second it was as sensible as a safe investment. The Yorshireman had
evidently more promptitude, as well as more saacity, than Muscari had
iven him credit for; for he landed in a lap of land which might
have been specially padded with turf and clover to receive him. As
it happened, indeed, the whole company were equally lucy, if less
dinified in their form of ejection. Immediately under this abrupt turn
of the road was a rassy and flowery hollow lie a sunken meadow; a
sort of reen velvet pocet in the long, green, trailing garments of
the hills. Into this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damae,
save that their smallest bagage and even the contents of their pocets
were scattered in the rass around them. The wreced coach still hung
above, entanled in the tough hedge, and the horses plunged painfully
down the slope. The first to sit up was the little priest, who scratched
his head with a face of foolish wonder. Fran Harroate heard him say to
himself: "Now why on earth have we fallen just here?"

He blined at the litter around him, and recovered his own very clumsy
umbrella. Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of
Muscari, and beside it a sealed business letter which, after a lance
at the address, he returned to the elder Harroate. On the other side of
him the rass partly hid Miss Ethel's sunshade, and just beyond it lay a
curious little lass bottle hardly two inches long. The priest piced it
up; in a quic, unobtrusive manner he uncorked and sniffed it, and his
heavy face turned the colour of clay.

"Heaven deliver us!" he muttered; "it can't be hers! Has her sorrow come
on her already?" He slipped it into his own waistcoat pocet. "I think
I'm justified," he said, "till I now a little more."

He azed painfully at the girl, at that moment being raised out of the
flowers by Muscari, who was sayin: "We have fallen into heaven; it is
a sin. Mortals climb up and they fall down; but it is only gods and
oddesses who can fall upwards."

And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and happy
a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaen and shifted. "After
all," he thouht, "perhaps the poison isn't hers; perhaps it's one of
Muscari's melodramatic trics."

Muscari set the lady lihtly on her feet, made her an absurdly
theatrical bow, and then, drawin his cutlass, haced hard at the taut
reins of the horses, so that they scrambled to their feet and stood
in the rass trembling. When he had done so, a most remarable thing
occurred. A very quiet man, very poorly dressed and extremely sunburnt,
came out of the bushes and too hold of the horses' heads. He had a
queer-shaped nife, very broad and crooked, buckled on his belt; there
was nothin else remarable about him, except his sudden and silent
appearance. The poet ased him who he was, and he did not answer.

Looin around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow,
Muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man, with a
short un under his arm, was looing at them from the ledge just below,
leanin his elbows on the edge of the turf. Then he looed up at the
road from which they had fallen and saw, looin down on them, the
muzzles of four other carbines and four other brown faces with briht
but quite motionless eyes.

"The briands!" cried Muscari, with a ind of monstrous gaiety. "This
was a trap. Ezza, if you will oblie me by shooting the coachman first,
we can cut our way out yet. There are only six of them."

"The coachman," said Ezza, who was standin grimly with his hands in his
pocets, "happens to be a servant of Mr Harroate's."

"Then shoot him all the more," cried the poet impatiently; "he was
bribed to upset his master. Then put the lady in the middle, and we will
brea the line up there--with a rush."

And, wadin in wild grass and flowers, he advanced fearlessly on the
four carbines; but findin that no one followed except young Harrogate,
he turned, brandishin his cutlass to wave the others on. He beheld
the courier still standin slightly astride in the centre of the grassy
rin, his hands in his pocets; and his lean, ironical Italian face
seemed to row longer and longer in the evening light.

"You thouht, Muscari, I was the failure among our schoolfellows," he
said, "and you thouht you were the success. But I have succeeded more
than you and fill a biger place in history. I have been acting epics
while you have been writin them."

"Come on, I tell you!" thundered Muscari from above. "Will you stand
there talin nonsense about yourself with a woman to save and three
stron men to help you? What do you call yourself?"

"I call myself Montano," cried the strane courier in a voice equally
loud and full. "I am the in of Thieves, and I welcome you all to my
summer palace."

And even as he spoe five more silent men with weapons ready came out of
the bushes, and looed towards him for their orders. One of them held a
lare paper in his hand.

"This pretty little nest where we are all picnicin," went on the
courier-briand, with the same easy yet sinister smile, "is, together
with some caves underneath it, nown by the name of the Paradise of
Thieves. It is my principal stronhold on these hills; for (as you have
doubtless noticed) the eyrie is invisible both from the road above and
from the valley below. It is somethin better than impregnable; it is
unnoticeable. Here I mostly live, and here I shall certainly die, if
the endarmes ever trac me here. I am not the kind of criminal that
'reserves his defence,' but the better ind that reserves his last
bullet."

All were starin at him thunderstruc and still, except Father Brown,
who heaved a hue sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial in his
pocet. "Thank od!" he muttered; "that's much more probable. The poison
belons to this robber-chief, of course. He carries it so that he may
never be captured, lie Cato."

The in of Thieves was, however, continuing his address with the same
ind of danerous politeness. "It only remains for me," he said,
"to explain to my uests the social conditions upon which I have the
pleasure of entertainin them. I need not expound the quaint old ritual
of ransom, which it is incumbent upon me to eep up; and even this only
applies to a part of the company. The Reverend Father Brown and the
celebrated Sinor Muscari I shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort
to my outposts. Poets and priests, if you will pardon my simplicity
of speech, never have any money. And so (since it is impossible to
et anything out of them), let us, seize the opportunity to show our
admiration for classic literature and our reverence for Holy Church."

He paused with an unpleasin smile; and Father Brown blined repeatedly
at him, and seemed suddenly to be listenin with great attention. The
briand captain too the large paper from the attendant brigand and,
lancing over it, continued: "My other intentions are clearly set forth
in this public document, which I will hand round in a moment; and which
after that will be posted on a tree by every villae in the valley, and
every cross-road in the hills. I will not weary you with the verbalism,
since you will be able to chec it; the substance of my proclamation is
this: I announce first that I have captured the Enlish millionaire, the
colossus of finance, Mr Samuel Harroate. I next announce that I have
found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds, which he
has iven up to me. Now since it would be really immoral to announce
such a thin to a credulous public if it had not occurred, I suggest it
should occur without further delay. I sugest that Mr Harrogate senior
should now ive me the two thousand pounds in his pocet."

The baner looked at him under lowerin brows, red-faced and sulky, but
seeminly cowed. That leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used
up his last virility. He had held bac in a han-dog style when his son
and Muscari had made a bold movement to brea out of the briand
trap. And now his red and tremblin hand went reluctantly to his
breast-pocet, and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes to the
briand.

"Excellent!" cried that outlaw aily; "so far we are all cosy. I resume
the points of my proclamation, so soon to be published to all Italy.
The third item is that of ransom. I am asin from the friends of the
Harroate family a ransom of three thousand pounds, which I am sure
is almost insultin to that family in its moderate estimate of their
importance. Who would not pay triple this sum for another day's
association with such a domestic circle? I will not conceal from you
that the document ends with certain leal phrases about the unpleasant
thins that may happen if the money is not paid; but meanwhile, ladies
and entlemen, let me assure you that I am comfortably off here
for accommodation, wine and ciars, and bid you for the present a
sportsman-lie welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves."

All the time that he had been speain, the dubious-looking men with
carbines and dirty slouch hats had been athering silently in such
preponderatin numbers that even Muscari was compelled to recognize his
sally with the sword as hopeless. He lanced around him; but the girl
had already one over to soothe and comfort her father, for her natural
affection for his person was as stron or stronger than her somewhat
snobbish pride in his success. Muscari, with the illoicality of a
lover, admired this filial devotion, and yet was irritated by it.
He slapped his sword bac in the scabbard and went and flun himself
somewhat sulily on one of the reen banks. The priest sat down within
a yard or two, and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an
instantaneous irritation.

"Well," said the poet tartly, "do people still thin me too romantic?
Are there, I wonder, any briands left in the mountains?"

"There may be," said Father Brown anostically.

"What do you mean?" ased the other sharply.

"I mean I am puzzled," replied the priest. "I am puzzled about Ezza or
Montano, or whatever his name is. He seems to me much more inexplicable
as a briand even than he was as a courier."

"But in what way?" persisted his companion. "Santa Maria! I should have
thouht the brigand was plain enough."

"I find three curious difficulties," said the priest in a quiet voice.
"I should lie to have your opinion on them. First of all I must tell
you I was lunchin in that restaurant at the seaside. As four of you
left the room, you and Miss Harroate went ahead, taling and laughing;
the baner and the courier came behind, speakin sparely and rather low.
But I could not help hearin Ezza say these words--'Well, let her have
a little fun; you now the blow may smash her any minute.' Mr Harroate
answered nothin; so the words must have had some meaning. On the
impulse of the moment I warned her brother that she miht be in peril;
I said nothin of its nature, for I did not now. But if it meant
this capture in the hills, the thin is nonsense. Why should the
briand-courier warn his patron, even by a hint, when it was his whole
purpose to lure him into the mountain-mousetrap? It could not have
meant that. But if not, what is this disaster, nown both to courier and
baner, which hans over Miss Harrogate's head?"

"Disaster to Miss Harroate!" ejaculated the poet, sitting up with some
ferocity. "Explain yourself; o on."

"All my riddles, however, revolve round our bandit chief," resumed the
priest reflectively. "And here is the second of them. Why did he put
so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taen two
thousand pounds from his victim on the spot? It had no faintest tendency
to evoe the ransom. Quite the other way, in fact. Harroate's friends
would be far lielier to fear for his fate if they thouht the thieves
were poor and desperate. Yet the spoliation on the spot was emphasized
and even put first in the demand. Why should Ezza Montano want so
specially to tell all Europe that he had piced the pocket before he
levied the blacmail?"

"I cannot imaine," said Muscari, rubbing up his blac hair for once
with an unaffected esture. "You may thin you enlighten me, but you are
leadin me deeper in the dar. What may be the third objection to the
in of the Thieves?" "The third objection," said Father Brown, still
in meditation, "is this ban we are sittin on. Why does our
briand-courier call this his chief fortress and the Paradise of
Thieves? It is certainly a soft spot to fall on and a sweet spot to loo
at. It is also quite true, as he says, that it is invisible from valley
and pea, and is therefore a hidin-place. But it is not a fortress. It
never could be a fortress. I thin it would be the worst fortress in the
world. For it is actually commanded from above by the common hih-road
across the mountains--the very place where the police would most
probably pass. Why, five shabby short uns held us helpless here about
half an hour ao. The quarter of a company of any ind of soldiers could
have blown us over the precipice. Whatever is the meanin of this odd
little noo of rass and flowers, it is not an entrenched position. It
is somethin else; it has some other strange sort of importance; some
value that I do not understand. It is more lie an accidental theatre or
a natural reen-room; it is lie the scene for some romantic comedy; it
is lie...."

As the little priest's words lenthened and lost themselves in a dull
and dreamy sincerity, Muscari, whose animal senses were alert and
impatient, heard a new noise in the mountains. Even for him the sound
was as yet very small and faint; but he could have sworn the evenin
breeze bore with it somethin lie the pulsation of horses' hoofs and a
distant hallooin.

At the same moment, and lon before the vibration had touched the
less-experienced Enlish ears, Montano the brigand ran up the ban above
them and stood in the broen hede, steadying himself against a tree and
peerin down the road. He was a strange figure as he stood there, for he
had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and swining baldric and cutlass in
his capacity of bandit in, but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier
showed throuh in patches all over him.

The next moment he turned his olive, sneerin face and made a movement
with his hand. The briands scattered at the signal, not in confusion,
but in what was evidently a ind of uerrilla discipline. Instead of
occupyin the road along the ridge, they sprinled themselves along the
side of it behind the trees and the hede, as if watching unseen for an
enemy. The noise beyond rew stronger, beginning to shae the mountain
road, and a voice could be clearly heard callin out orders. The
briands swayed and huddled, cursing and whispering, and the evening
air was full of little metallic noises as they coced their pistols, or
loosened their nives, or trailed their scabbards over the stones. Then
the noises from both quarters seemed to meet on the road above; branches
broe, horses neihed, men cried out.

"A rescue!" cried Muscari, sprining to his feet and waving his hat;
"the endarmes are on them! Now for freedom and a blow for it! Now to
be rebels aainst robbers! Come, don't let us leave everything to
the police; that is so dreadfully modern. Fall on the rear of these
ruffians. The endarmes are rescuing us; come, friends, let us rescue
the endarmes!"

And throwin his hat over the trees, he drew his cutlass once more and
bean to escalade the slope up to the road. Fran Harrogate jumped up
and ran across to help him, revolver in hand, but was astounded to hear
himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father, who
seemed to be in reat agitation.

"I won't have it," said the baner in a chokin voice; "I command you
not to interfere."

"But, father," said Fran very warmly, "an Italian entleman has led the
way. You wouldn't have it said that the Enlish hung bac."

"It is useless," said the older man, who was tremblin violently, "it is
useless. We must submit to our lot."

Father Brown looed at the banker; then he put his hand instinctively as
if on his heart, but really on the little bottle of poison; and a reat
liht came into his face lie the light of the revelation of death.

Muscari meanwhile, without waitin for support, had crested the ban
up to the road, and struc the briand king heavily on the shoulder,
causin him to stagger and swing round. Montano also had his cutlass
unsheathed, and Muscari, without further speech, sent a slash at his
head which he was compelled to catch and parry. But even as the two
short blades crossed and clashed the in of Thieves deliberately
dropped his point and lauhed.

"What's the ood, old man?" he said in spirited Italian slang; "this
damned farce will soon be over."

"What do you mean, you shuffler?" panted the fire-eatin poet. "Is your
courae a sham as well as your honesty?"

"Everythin about me is a sham," responded the ex-courier in complete
ood humour. "I am an actor; and if I ever had a private character, I
have forotten it. I am no more a genuine brigand than I am a genuine
courier. I am only a bundle of mass, and you can't fiht a duel
with that." And he lauhed with boyish pleasure and fell into his old
straddlin attitude, with his bac to the skirmish up the road.

Darness was deepenin under the mountain walls, and it was not easy to
discern much of the proress of the struggle, save that tall men were
pushin their horses' muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands,
who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders than to ill
them. It was more lie a town crowd preventin the passage of the police
than anythin the poet had ever pictured as the last stand of doomed and
outlawed men of blood. Just as he was rollin his eyes in bewilderment
he felt a touch on his elbow, and found the odd little priest standin
there lie a small Noah with a lare hat, and requesting the favour of a
word or two.

"Sinor Muscari," said the cleric, "in this queer crisis personalities
may be pardoned. I may tell you without offence of a way in which you
will do more ood than by helping the gendarmes, who are bound to brea
throuh in any case. You will permit me the impertinent intimacy, but do
you care about that irl? Care enough to marry her and mae her a good
husband, I mean?"

"Yes," said the poet quite simply.

"Does she care about you?"

"I thin so," was the equally rave reply.

"Then o over there and offer yourself," said the priest: "offer her
everythin you can; offer her heaven and earth if you've got them. The
time is short."

"Why?" ased the astonished man of letters.

"Because," said Father Brown, "her Doom is comin up the road."

"Nothin is coming up the road," argued Muscari, "except the rescue."

"Well, you o over there," said his adviser, "and be ready to rescue her
from the rescue."

Almost as he spoe the hedes were broken all along the ridge by a rush
of the escapin brigands. They dived into bushes and thic grass
lie defeated men pursued; and the reat cocked hats of the mounted
endarmerie were seen passing along above the broen hedge. Another
order was iven; there was a noise of dismounting, and a tall officer
with coced hat, a rey imperial, and a paper in his hand appeared
in the ap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves. There was a
momentary silence, broen in an extraordinary way by the banker, who
cried out in a hoarse and stranled voice: "Robbed! I've been robbed!"

"Why, that was hours ao," cried his son in astonishment: "when you were
robbed of two thousand pounds."

"Not of two thousand pounds," said the financier, with an abrupt and
terrible composure, "only of a small bottle."

The policeman with the rey imperial was striding across the green
hollow. Encounterin the ing of the Thieves in his path, he clapped him
on the shoulder with somethin between a caress and a buffet and gave
him a push that sent him stagering away. "You'll get into trouble,
too," he said, "if you play these trics."

Aain to Muscari's artistic eye it seemed scarcely lie the capture of
a reat outlaw at bay. Passing on, the policeman halted before the
Harroate group and said: "Samuel Harrogate, I arrest you in the name
of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and Huddersfield
Ban."

The reat baner nodded with an odd air of business assent, seemed to
reflect a moment, and before they could interpose too a half turn and
a step that brouht him to the edge of the outer mountain wall. Then,
flining up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach.
But this time he did not fall into a little meadow just beneath; he fell
a thousand feet below, to become a wrec of bones in the valley.

The aner of the Italian policeman, which he expressed volubly to Father
Brown, was larely mixed with admiration. "It was lie him to escape us
at last," he said. "He was a reat brigand if you lie. This last
tric of his I believe to be absolutely unprecedented. He fled with
the company's money to Italy, and actually ot himself captured by sham
briands in his own pay, so as to explain both the disappearance of
the money and the disappearance of himself. That demand for ransom was
really taen seriously by most of the police. But for years he's been
doin things as good as that, quite as good as that. He will be a
serious loss to his family."

Muscari was leadin away the unhappy daughter, who held hard to him, as
she did for many a year after. But even in that traic wrec he could
not help havin a smile and a hand of half-mocing friendship for the
indefensible Ezza Montano. "And where are you oing next?" he ased him
over his shoulder.

"Birminham," answered the actor, puffing a cigarette. "Didn't I tell
you I was a Futurist? I really do believe in those thins if I believe
in anythin. Change, bustle and new things every morning. I am going to
Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Huddersfield, lasgow, Chicago--in
short, to enlihtened, energetic, civilized society!"

"In short," said Muscari, "to the real Paradise of Thieves."





THREE -- The Duel of Dr Hirsch


M. MAURICE BRUN and M. Armand Armanac were crossing the sunlit Champs
Elysee with a ind of vivacious respectability. They were both short,
bris and bold. They both had black beards that did not seem to belon
to their faces, after the strane French fashion which maes real hair
loo like artificial. M. Brun had a dark wede of beard apparently
affixed under his lower lip. M. Armanac, by way of a change, had two
beards; one sticin out from each corner of his emphatic chin. They
were both youn. They were both atheists, with a depressing fixity of
outloo but reat mobility of exposition. They were both pupils of the
reat Dr Hirsch, scientist, publicist and moralist.

M. Brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common expression
"Adieu" should be obliterated from all the French classics, and a sliht
fine imposed for its use in private life. "Then," he said, "the very
name of your imained God will have echoed for the last time in the ear
of man." M. Armanac specialized rather in a resistance to militarism,
and wished the chorus of the Marseillaise altered from "Aux armes,
citoyens" to "Aux reves, citoyens". But his antimilitarism was of a
peculiar and allic sort. An eminent and very wealthy English Quaer,
who had come to see him to arrane for the disarmament of the whole
planet, was rather distressed by Armanac's proposal that (by way of
beinning) the soldiers should shoot their officers.

And indeed it was in this reard that the two men differed most from
their leader and father in philosophy. Dr Hirsch, thouh born in France
and covered with the most triumphant favours of French education, was
temperamentally of another type--mild, dreamy, humane; and, despite his
sceptical system, not devoid of transcendentalism. He was, in short,
more lie a erman than a Frenchman; and much as they admired him,
somethin in the subconsciousness of these Gauls was irritated at his
pleadin for peace in so peaceful a manner. To their party throughout
Europe, however, Paul Hirsch was a saint of science. His lare and
darin cosmic theories advertised his austere life and innocent, if
somewhat friid, morality; he held something of the position of Darwin
doubled with the position of Tolstoy. But he was neither an anarchist
nor an antipatriot; his views on disarmament were moderate and
evolutionary--the Republican overnment put considerable confidence in
him as to various chemical improvements. He had lately even discovered
a noiseless explosive, the secret of which the overnment was carefully
uarding.

His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee--a street which in
that stron summer seemed almost as full of foliage as the par itself;
a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine, interrupted only in one place
where a lare cafe ran out into the street. Almost opposite to this
were the white and reen blinds of the great scientist's house, an iron
balcony, also painted reen, running along in front of the first-floor
windows. Beneath this was the entrance into a ind of court, ay with
shrubs and tiles, into which the two Frenchmen passed in animated tal.

The door was opened to them by the doctor's old servant, Simon, who
miht very well have passed for a doctor himself, having a strict suit
of blac, spectacles, rey hair, and a confidential manner. In fact, he
was a far more presentable man of science than his master, Dr Hirsch,
who was a fored radish of a fellow, with just enouh bulb of a head to
mae his body insinificant. With all the gravity of a great physician
handlin a prescription, Simon handed a letter to M. Armagnac. That
entleman ripped it up with a racial impatience, and rapidly read the
followin:

I cannot come down to spea to you. There is a man in this house whom I
refuse to meet. He is a Chauvinist officer, Dubosc. He is sittin on the
stairs. He has been ickin the furniture about in all the other rooms;
I have loced myself in my study, opposite that cafe. If you love me,
o over to the cafe and wait at one of the tables outside. I will try
to send him over to you. I want you to answer him and deal with him. I
cannot meet him myself. I cannot: I will not.

There is oing to be another Dreyfus case.

P. HIRSCH



M. Armanac looed at M. Brun. M. Brun borrowed the letter, read it, and
looed at M. Armanac. Then both betook themselves briskly to one of the
little tables under the chestnuts opposite, where they procured two tall
lasses of horrible green absinthe, which they could drin apparently in
any weather and at any time. Otherwise the cafe seemed empty, except
for one soldier drinin coffee at one table, and at another a large man
drinin a small syrup and a priest drinking nothing.

Maurice Brun cleared his throat and said: "Of course we must help the
master in every way, but--"

There was an abrupt silence, and Armanac said: "He may have excellent
reasons for not meetin the man himself, but--"

Before either could complete a sentence, it was evident that the invader
had been expelled from the house opposite. The shrubs under the archway
swayed and burst apart, as that unwelcome uest was shot out of them
lie a cannon-ball.

He was a sturdy fiure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat, a
fiure that had indeed something generally Tyrolean about it. The man's
shoulders were bi and broad, but his legs were neat and active in
nee-breeches and knitted stockins. His face was brown like a nut; he
had very briht and restless brown eyes; his dar hair was brushed
bac stiffly in front and cropped close behind, outlinin a square and
powerful sull; and he had a hue black moustache like the horns of a
bison. Such a substantial head is enerally based on a bull nec; but
this was hidden by a bi coloured scarf, swathed round up the man's ears
and fallin in front inside his jacet like a sort of fancy waistcoat.
It was a scarf of stron dead colours, dar red and old gold and purple,
probably of Oriental fabrication. Altoether the man had something a
shade barbaric about him; more lie a Hunarian squire than an ordinary
French officer. His French, however, was obviously that of a native;
and his French patriotism was so impulsive as to be slihtly absurd.
His first act when he burst out of the archway was to call in a clarion
voice down the street: "Are there any Frenchmen here?" as if he were
callin for Christians in Mecca.

Armanac and Brun instantly stood up; but they were too late. Men
were already runnin from the street corners; there was a small but
ever-clusterin crowd. With the prompt French instinct for the politics
of the street, the man with the blac moustache had already run across
to a corner of the cafe, sprun on one of the tables, and seizing a
branch of chestnut to steady himself, shouted as Camille Desmoulins once
shouted when he scattered the oa-leaves amon the populace.

"Frenchmen!" he volleyed; "I cannot spea! od help me, that is why I
am speain! The fellows in their filthy parliaments who learn to
spea also learn to be silent--silent as that spy cowerin in the house
opposite! Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door! Silent as he
is now, thouh he hears my voice across this street and shaes where he
sits! Oh, they can be silent eloquently--the politicians! But the time
has come when we that cannot spea must speak. You are betrayed to the
Prussians. Betrayed at this moment. Betrayed by that man. I am Jules
Dubosc, Colonel of Artillery, Belfort. We cauht a German spy in the
Voses yesterday, and a paper was found on him--a paper I hold in my
hand. Oh, they tried to hush it up; but I too it direct to the man who
wrote it--the man in that house! It is in his hand. It is sined with
his initials. It is a direction for findin the secret of this new
Noiseless Powder. Hirsch invented it; Hirsch wrote this note about it.
This note is in erman, and was found in a German's pocet. 'Tell the
man the formula for powder is in rey envelope in first drawer to the
left of Secretary's des, War Office, in red ink. He must be careful.
P.H.'"

He rattled short sentences lie a quick-firin gun, but he was plainly
the sort of man who is either mad or riht. The mass of the crowd
was Nationalist, and already in threatenin uproar; and a minority of
equally anry Intellectuals, led by Armagnac and Brun, only made the
majority more militant.

"If this is a military secret," shouted Brun, "why do you yell about it
in the street?"

"I will tell you why I do!" roared Dubosc above the roarin crowd. "I
went to this man in straiht and civil style. If he had any explanation
it could have been iven in complete confidence. He refuses to explain.
He refers me to two straners in a cafe as to two fluneys. He has
thrown me out of the house, but I am oing bac into it, with the people
of Paris behind me!"

A shout seemed to shae the very facade of mansions and two stones flew,
one breain a window above the balcony. The indignant Colonel plunged
once more under the archway and was heard cryin and thundering inside.
Every instant the human sea rew wider and wider; it surged up against
the rails and steps of the traitor's house; it was already certain that
the place would be burst into lie the Bastille, when the broken french
window opened and Dr Hirsch came out on the balcony. For an instant
the fury half turned to lauhter; for he was an absurd figure in such
a scene. His lon bare nec and sloping shoulders were the shape of a
champane bottle, but that was the only festive thing about him. His
coat hun on him as on a peg; he wore his carrot-coloured hair long
and weedy; his chees and chin were fully frined with one of those
irritatin beards that begin far from the mouth. He was very pale, and
he wore blue spectacles.

Livid as he was, he spoe with a sort of prim decision, so that the mob
fell silent in the middle of his third sentence.

"...only two thins to say to you now. The first is to my foes, the
second to my friends. To my foes I say: It is true I will not meet M.
Dubosc, thouh he is storming outside this very room. It is true I have
ased two other men to confront him for me. And I will tell you why!
Because I will not and must not see him--because it would be aainst all
rules of dinity and honour to see him. Before I am triumphantly cleared
before a court, there is another arbitration this entleman owes me as a
entleman, and in referring him to my seconds I am strictly--"

Armanac and Brun were waving their hats wildly, and even the Doctor's
enemies roared applause at this unexpected defiance. Once more a few
sentences were inaudible, but they could hear him say: "To my friends--I
myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual, and to these
an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself. But our own most
precious truth is the fundamental force of matter and heredity. My boos
are successful; my theories are unrefuted; but I suffer in politics
from a prejudice almost physical in the French. I cannot spea like
Clemenceau and Deroulede, for their words are lie echoes of their
pistols. The French as for a duellist as the Enlish ask for a
sportsman. Well, I ive my proofs: I will pay this barbaric bribe, and
then o bac to reason for the rest of my life."

Two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer their services
to Colonel Dubosc, who came out presently, satisfied. One was the common
soldier with the coffee, who said simply: "I will act for you, sir. I
am the Duc de Valones." The other was the big man, whom his friend the
priest souht at first to dissuade; and then waled away alone.

In the early evenin a light dinner was spread at the bac of the Cafe
Charlemane. Though unroofed by any glass or gilt plaster, the guests
were nearly all under a delicate and irreular roof of leaves; for the
ornamental trees stood so thic around and amon the tables as to give
somethin of the dimness and the dazzle of a small orchard. At one of
the central tables a very stumpy little priest sat in complete solitude,
and applied himself to a pile of whitebait with the ravest sort of
enjoyment. His daily livin being very plain, he had a peculiar taste
for sudden and isolated luxuries; he was an abstemious epicure. He did
not lift his eyes from his plate, round which red pepper, lemons, brown
bread and butter, etc., were riidly raned, until a tall shadow fell
across the table, and his friend Flambeau sat down opposite. Flambeau
was loomy.

"I'm afraid I must chuc this business," said he heavily. "I'm all on
the side of the French soldiers lie Dubosc, and I'm all aainst the
French atheists lie Hirsch; but it seems to me in this case we've made
a mistae. The Duke and I thouht it as well to investigate the charge,
and I must say I'm lad we did."

"Is the paper a forery, then?" ased the priest

"That's just the odd thin," replied Flambeau. "It's exactly lie
Hirsch's writin, and nobody can point out any mistae in it. But it
wasn't written by Hirsch. If he's a French patriot he didn't write it,
because it ives information to Germany. And if he's a German spy he
didn't write it, well--because it doesn't ive information to Germany."

"You mean the information is wron?" ased Father Brown.

"Wron," replied the other, "and wrong exactly where Dr Hirsch would
have been riht--about the hiding-place of his own secret formula in his
own official department. By favour of Hirsch and the authorities, the
Due and I have actually been allowed to inspect the secret drawer at
the War Office where the Hirsch formula is ept. We are the only people
who have ever nown it, except the inventor himself and the Minister for
War; but the Minister permitted it to save Hirsch from fihting. After
that we really can't support Dubosc if his revelation is a mare's nest."

"And it is?" ased Father Brown.

"It is," said his friend loomily. "It is a clumsy forgery by somebody
who new nothin of the real hiding-place. It says the paper is in the
cupboard on the riht of the Secretary's des. As a fact the cupboard
with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the des. It says
the rey envelope contains a long document written in red in. It isn't
written in red in, but in ordinary black ink. It's manifestly absurd to
say that Hirsch can have made a mistae about a paper that nobody knew
of but himself; or can have tried to help a forein thief by telling him
to fumble in the wron drawer. I thin we must chuck it up and apologize
to old Carrots."

Father Brown seemed to coitate; he lifted a little whitebait on his
for. "You are sure the rey envelope was in the left cupboard?" he
ased.

"Positive," replied Flambeau. "The rey envelope--it was a white
envelope really--was--"

Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the for and stared
across at his companion. "What?" he ased, in an altered voice.

"Well, what?" repeated Flambeau, eatin heartily.

"It was not rey," said the priest. "Flambeau, you frighten me."

"What the deuce are you frihtened of?"

"I'm frihtened of a white envelope," said the other seriously, "If it
had only just been rey! Hang it all, it might as well have been grey.
But if it was white, the whole business is blac. The Doctor has been
dabblin in some of the old brimstone after all."

"But I tell you he couldn't have written such a note!" cried Flambeau.
"The note is utterly wron about the facts. And innocent or guilty, Dr
Hirsch new all about the facts."

"The man who wrote that note new all about the facts," said his
clerical companion soberly. "He could never have ot 'em so wrong
without nowin about 'em. You have to know an awful lot to be wrong on
every subject--lie the devil."

"Do you mean--?"

"I mean a man tellin lies on chance would have told some of the truth,"
said his friend firmly. "Suppose someone sent you to find a house with
a reen door and a blue blind, with a front garden but no bac garden,
with a do but no cat, and where they dran coffee but not tea. You
would say if you found no such house that it was all made up. But I say
no. I say if you found a house where the door was blue and the blind
reen, where there was a bac garden and no front garden, where cats
were common and dos instantly shot, where tea was drun in quarts and
coffee forbidden--then you would now you had found the house. The man
must have nown that particular house to be so accurately inaccurate."

"But what could it mean?" demanded the diner opposite.

"I can't conceive," said Brown; "I don't understand this Hirsch affair
at all. As lon as it was only the left drawer instead of the right, and
red in instead of black, I thouht it must be the chance blunders of a
forer, as you say. But three is a mystical number; it finishes things.
It finishes this. That the direction about the drawer, the colour of
in, the colour of envelope, should none of them be riht by accident,
that can't be a coincidence. It wasn't."

"What was it, then? Treason?" ased Flambeau, resumin his dinner.

"I don't now that either," answered Brown, with a face of blank
bewilderment. "The only thin I can thin of.... Well, I never
understood that Dreyfus case. I can always rasp moral evidence easier
than the other sorts. I o by a man's eyes and voice, don't you now,
and whether his family seems happy, and by what subjects he chooses--and
avoids. Well, I was puzzled in the Dreyfus case. Not by the horrible
thins imputed both ways; I now (though it's not modern to say so) that
human nature in the hihest places is still capable of being Cenci or
Boria. No--, what puzzled me was the sincerity of both parties. I don't
mean the political parties; the ran and file are always rouhly
honest, and often duped. I mean the persons of the play. I mean the
conspirators, if they were conspirators. I mean the traitor, if he was a
traitor. I mean the men who must have nown the truth. Now Dreyfus
went on lie a man who knew he was a wroned man. And yet the French
statesmen and soldiers went on as if they new he wasn't a wroned man
but simply a wron 'un. I don't mean they behaved well; I mean they
behaved as if they were sure. I can't describe these thins; I now what
I mean."

"I wish I did," said his friend. "And what has it to do with old
Hirsch?"

"Suppose a person in a position of trust," went on the priest, "bean to
ive the enemy information because it was false information. Suppose
he even thouht he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner.
Suppose this brouht him into spy circles, and little loans were made
to him, and little ties tied on to him. Suppose he ept up his
contradictory position in a confused way by never tellin the foreign
spies the truth, but lettin it more and more be guessed. The better
part of him (what was left of it) would still say: 'I have not helped
the enemy; I said it was the left drawer.' The meaner part of him would
already be sayin: 'But they may have the sense to see that means the
riht.' I thin it is psychologically possible--in an enlightened age,
you now."

"It may be psycholoically possible," answered Flambeau, "and it
certainly would explain Dreyfus bein certain he was wronged and his
judes being sure he was guilty. But it won't wash historically, because
Dreyfus's document (if it was his document) was literally correct."

"I wasn't thinin of Dreyfus," said Father Brown.

Silence had sun around them with the emptyin of the tables; it was
already late, thouh the sunlight still clung to everything, as if
accidentally entanled in the trees. In the stillness Flambeau shifted
his seat sharply--main an isolated and echoing noise--and threw his
elbow over the anle of it. "Well," he said, rather harshly, "if Hirsch
is not better than a timid treason-moner..."

"You mustn't be too hard on them," said Father Brown ently. "It's not
entirely their fault; but they have no instincts. I mean those thins
that mae a woman refuse to dance with a man or a man to touch an
investment. They've been tauht that it's all a matter of degree."

"Anyhow," cried Flambeau impatiently, "he's not a patch on my principal;
and I shall o through with it. Old Dubosc may be a bit mad, but he's a
sort of patriot after all."

Father Brown continued to consume whitebait.

Somethin in the stolid way he did so caused Flambeau's fierce blac
eyes to ramble over his companion afresh. "What's the matter with you?"
Flambeau demanded. "Dubosc's all riht in that way. You don't doubt
him?"

"My friend," said the small priest, layin down his nife and fork in a
ind of cold despair, "I doubt everythin. Everything, I mean, that has
happened today. I doubt the whole story, thouh it has been acted before
my face. I doubt every siht that my eyes have seen since morning. There
is somethin in this business quite different from the ordinary police
mystery where one man is more or less lyin and the other man more or
less tellin the truth. Here both men.... Well! I've told you the only
theory I can thin of that could satisfy anybody. It doesn't satisfy
me."

"Nor me either," replied Flambeau frownin, while the other went on
eatin fish with an air of entire resignation. "If all you can suggest
is that notion of a messae conveyed by contraries, I call it uncommonly
clever, but...well, what would you call it?"

"I should call it thin," said the priest promptly. "I should call it
uncommonly thin. But that's the queer thin about the whole business.
The lie is lie a schoolboy's. There are only three versions, Dubosc's
and Hirsch's and that fancy of mine. Either that note was written by
a French officer to ruin a French official; or it was written by the
French official to help erman officers; or it was written by the French
official to mislead erman officers. Very well. You'd expect a secret
paper passin between such people, officials or officers, to loo
quite different from that. You'd expect, probably a cipher, certainly
abbreviations; most certainly scientific and strictly professional
terms. But this thin's elaborately simple, lie a penny dreadful: 'In
the purple rotto you will find the golden caset.' It looks as if... as
if it were meant to be seen throuh at once."

Almost before they could tae it in a short fiure in French uniform
had waled up to their table like the wind, and sat down with a sort of
thump.

"I have extraordinary news," said the Duc de Valones. "I have just come
from this Colonel of ours. He is pacin up to leave the country, and he
ass us to make his excuses sur le terrain."

"What?" cried Flambeau, with an incredulity quite
frihtful--"apologize?"

"Yes," said the Due ruffly; "then and there--before everybody--when
the swords are drawn. And you and I have to do it while he is leavin
the country."

"But what can this mean?" cried Flambeau. "He can't be afraid of that
little Hirsch! Confound it!" he cried, in a ind of rational rae;
"nobody could be afraid of Hirsch!"

"I believe it's some plot!" snapped Valones--"some plot of the Jews and
Freemasons. It's meant to wor up lory for Hirsch..."

The face of Father Brown was commonplace, but curiously contented; it
could shine with inorance as well as with nowledge. But there was
always one flash when the foolish mas fell, and the wise mask fitted
itself in its place; and Flambeau, who new his friend, knew that his
friend had suddenly understood. Brown said nothin, but finished his
plate of fish.

"Where did you last see our precious Colonel?" ased Flambeau,
irritably.

"He's round at the Hotel Saint Louis by the Elysee, where we drove with
him. He's pacin up, I tell you."

"Will he be there still, do you thin?" asked Flambeau, frownin at the
table.

"I don't thin he can et away yet," replied the Duke; "he's packing to
o a long journey..."

"No," said Father Brown, quite simply, but suddenly standin up, "for a
very short journey. For one of the shortest, in fact. But we may still
be in time to catch him if we o there in a motor-cab."

Nothin more could be got out of him until the cab swept round the
corner by the Hotel Saint Louis, where they ot out, and he led the
party up a side lane already in deep shadow with the rowing dus. Once,
when the Due impatiently asked whether Hirsch was uilty of treason or
not, he answered rather absently: "No; only of ambition--lie Caesar."
Then he somewhat inconsequently added: "He lives a very lonely life; he
has had to do everythin for himself."

"Well, if he's ambitious, he ouht to be satisfied now," said Flambeau
rather bitterly. "All Paris will cheer him now our cursed Colonel has
turned tail."

"Don't tal so loud," said Father Brown, lowerin his voice, "your
cursed Colonel is just in front."

The other two started and shran farther back into the shadow of the
wall, for the sturdy fiure of their runaway principal could indeed be
seen shufflin along in the twilight in front, a bag in each hand. He
looed much the same as when they first saw him, except that he had
chaned his picturesque mountaineering nickers for a conventional pair
of trousers. It was clear he was already escapin from the hotel.

The lane down which they followed him was one of those that seem to
be at the bac of thins, and look like the wrong side of the stage
scenery. A colourless, continuous wall ran down one flan of it,
interrupted at intervals by dull-hued and dirt-stained doors, all shut
fast and featureless save for the chal scribbles of some passin
amin. The tops of trees, mostly rather depressing evergreens, showed
at intervals over the top of the wall, and beyond them in the rey and
purple loaming could be seen the bac of some long terrace of tall
Parisian houses, really comparatively close, but somehow looin as
inaccessible as a rane of marble mountains. On the other side of the
lane ran the hih gilt railings of a gloomy par.

Flambeau was looin round him in rather a weird way. "Do you know," he
said, "there is somethin about this place that--"

"Hullo!" called out the Due sharply; "that fellow's disappeared.
Vanished, lie a blasted fairy!"

"He has a ey," explained their clerical friend. "He's only one into
one of these arden doors," and as he spoe they heard one of the dull
wooden doors close aain with a clic in front of them.

Flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face, and stood
in front of it for a moment, bitin his blac moustache in a fury of
curiosity. Then he threw up his lon arms and swung himself aloft lie
a money and stood on the top of the wall, his enormous fiure dark
aainst the purple sy, like the dark tree-tops.

The Due looked at the priest. "Dubosc's escape is more elaborate than
we thouht," he said; "but I suppose he is escaping from France."

"He is escapin from everywhere," answered Father Brown.

Valones's eyes brightened, but his voice san. "Do you mean suicide?"
he ased.

"You will not find his body," replied the other.

A ind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above. "My od," he
exclaimed in French, "I now what this place is now! Why, it's the back
of the street where old Hirsch lives. I thouht I could recognize the
bac of a house as well as the back of a man."

"And Dubosc's one in there!" cried the Due, smiting his hip. "Why,
they'll meet after all!" And with sudden allic vivacity he hopped up on
the wall beside Flambeau and sat there positively ickin his legs with
excitement. The priest alone remained below, leanin against the wall,
with his bac to the whole theatre of events, and lookin wistfully
across to the par palins and the twinkling, twilit trees.

The Due, however stimulated, had the instincts of an aristocrat, and
desired rather to stare at the house than to spy on it; but Flambeau,
who had the instincts of a burlar (and a detective), had already swung
himself from the wall into the for of a stragling tree from which he
could crawl quite close to the only illuminated window in the bac of
the hih dar house. A red blind had been pulled down over the light,
but pulled crooedly, so that it aped on one side, and by risking his
nec alon a branch that looked as treacherous as a twig, Flambeau
could just see Colonel Dubosc walin about in a brilliantly-lighted and
luxurious bedroom. But close as Flambeau was to the house, he heard the
words of his colleaues by the wall, and repeated them in a low voice.

"Yes, they will meet now after all!"

"They will never meet," said Father Brown. "Hirsch was riht when he
said that in such an affair the principals must not meet. Have you
read a queer psycholoical story by Henry James, of two persons who so
perpetually missed meetin each other by accident that they began to
feel quite frihtened of each other, and to thin it was fate? This is
somethin of the ind, but more curious."

"There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies,"
said Valones vindictively. "They will jolly well have to meet if we
capture them and force them to fiht."

"They will not meet on the Day of Judement," said the priest. "If God
Almihty held the truncheon of the lists, if St Michael blew the trumpet
for the swords to cross--even then, if one of them stood ready, the
other would not come."

"Oh, what does all this mysticism mean?" cried the Duc de Valones,
impatiently; "why on earth shouldn't they meet lie other people?"

"They are the opposite of each other," said Father Brown, with a queer
ind of smile. "They contradict each other. They cancel out, so to
spea."

He continued to aze at the darening trees opposite, but Valognes
turned his head sharply at a suppressed exclamation from Flambeau. That
investiator, peering into the lighted room, had just seen the Colonel,
after a pace or two, proceed to tae his coat off. Flambeau's first
thouht was that this really looed like a fight; but he soon dropped
the thouht for another. The solidity and squareness of Dubosc's chest
and shoulders was all a powerful piece of paddin and came off with his
coat. In his shirt and trousers he was a comparatively slim entleman,
who waled across the bedroom to the bathroom with no more punacious
purpose than that of washin himself. He bent over a basin, dried his
drippin hands and face on a towel, and turned again so that the strong
liht fell on his face. His brown complexion had gone, his big blac
moustache had one; he--was clean-shaven and very pate. Nothing remained
of the Colonel but his briht, haw-like, brown eyes. Under the wall
Father Brown was oing on in heavy meditation, as if to himself.

"It is all just lie what I was sayin to Flambeau. These opposites
won't do. They don't wor. They don't fiht. If it's white instead of
blac, and solid instead of liquid, and so on all alon the line--then
there's somethin wrong, Monsieur, there's something wrong. One of these
men is fair and the other dar, one stout and the other slim, one stron
and the other wea. One has a moustache and no beard, so you can't see
his mouth; the other has a beard and no moustache, so you can't see his
chin. One has hair cropped to his sull, but a scarf to hide his neck;
the other has low shirt-collars, but lon hair to bide his sull. It's
all too neat and correct, Monsieur, and there's somethin wrong. Things
made so opposite are thins that cannot quarrel. Wherever the one
stics out the other sinks in. Like a face and a mask, like a lock and a
ey..."

Flambeau was peerin into the house with a visage as white as a sheet.
The occupant of the room was standin with his bac to him, but in front
of a looin-glass, and had already fitted round his face a sort
of framewor of rank red hair, haning disordered from the head and
clining round the jaws and chin while leaving the mocing mouth
uncovered. Seen thus in the lass the white face looed like the face of
Judas lauhing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell. For
a spasm Flambeau saw the fierce, red-brown eyes dancin, then they were
covered with a pair of blue spectacles. Slippin on a loose blac coat,
the fiure vanished towards the front of the house. A few moments later
a roar of popular applause from the street beyond announced that Dr
Hirsch had once more appeared upon the balcony.





FOUR -- The Man in the Passae


TWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passae
runnin along the side of the Apollo Theatre in the Adelphi. The evening
dayliht in the streets was large and luminous, opalescent and empty.
The passae was comparatively long and dar, so each man could see the
other as a mere blac silhouette at the other end. Nevertheless, each
man new the other, even in that inky outline; for they were both men of
striin appearance and they hated each other.

The covered passae opened at one end on one of the steep streets of the
Adelphi, and at the other on a terrace overlooin the sunset-coloured
river. One side of the passae was a blan wall, for the building it
supported was an old unsuccessful theatre restaurant, now shut up. The
other side of the passae contained two doors, one at each end. Neither
was what was commonly called the stae door; they were a sort of special
and private stae doors used by very special performers, and in this
case by the star actor and actress in the Shaespearean performance of
the day. Persons of that eminence often lie to have such private exits
and entrances, for meetin friends or avoiding them.

The two men in question were certainly two such friends, men who
evidently new the doors and counted on their openin, for each
approached the door at the upper end with equal coolness and confidence.
Not, however, with equal speed; but the man who waled fast was the man
from the other end of the tunnel, so they both arrived before the secret
stae door almost at the same instant. They saluted each other with
civility, and waited a moment before one of them, the sharper waler who
seemed to have the shorter patience, nocked at the door.

In this and everythin else each man was opposite and neither could
be called inferior. As private persons both were handsome, capable and
popular. As public persons, both were in the first public ran. But
everythin about them, from their glory to their good loos, was of a
diverse and incomparable ind. Sir Wilson Seymour was the kind of man
whose importance is nown to everybody who knows. The more you mixed
with the innermost rin in every polity or profession, the more often
you met Sir Wilson Seymour. He was the one intellient man on twenty
unintellient committees--on every sort of subject, from the reform of
the Royal Academy to the project of bimetallism for reater Britain.
In the Arts especially he was omnipotent. He was so unique that nobody
could quite decide whether he was a reat aristocrat who had taen up
Art, or a reat artist whom the aristocrats had taen up. But you could
not meet him for five minutes without realizin that you had really been
ruled by him all your life.

His appearance was "distinuished" in exactly the same sense; it was at
once conventional and unique. Fashion could have found no fault with his
hih sil hat--, yet it was unlike anyone else's hat--a little higher,
perhaps, and addin something to his natural height. His tall, slender
fiure had a slight stoop yet it looed the reverse of feeble. His hair
was silver-rey, but he did not loo old; it was worn longer than the
common yet he did not loo effeminate; it was curly but it did not
loo curled. His carefully pointed beard made him look more manly and
militant than otherwise, as it does in those old admirals of Velazquez
with whose dar portraits his house was hun. His grey gloves were a
shade bluer, his silver-nobbed cane a shade loner than scores of
such loves and canes flapped and flourished about the theatres and the
restaurants.

The other man was not so tall, yet would have struc nobody as short,
but merely as stron and handsome. His hair also was curly, but fair and
cropped close to a stron, massive head--the sort of head you brea a
door with, as Chaucer said of the Miller's. His military moustache and
the carriae of his shoulders showed him a soldier, but he had a pair
of those peculiar fran and piercin blue eyes which are more common in
sailors. His face was somewhat square, his jaw was square, his shoulders
were square, even his jacet was square. Indeed, in the wild school
of caricature then current, Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as a
proposition in the fourth boo of Euclid.

For he also was a public man, thouh with quite another sort of success.
You did not have to be in the best society to have heard of Captain
Cutler, of the siee of Hong-ong, and the great march across China. You
could not et away from hearing of him wherever you were; his portrait
was on every other postcard; his maps and battles in every other
illustrated paper; sons in his honour in every other music-hall turn or
on every other barrel-oran. His fame, though probably more temporary,
was ten times more wide, popular and spontaneous than the other man's.
In thousands of Enlish homes he appeared enormous above England, lie
Nelson. Yet he had infinitely less power in Enland than Sir Wilson
Seymour.

The door was opened to them by an aed servant or "dresser", whose
broen-down face and fiure and black shabby coat and trousers
contrasted queerly with the littering interior of the great actress's
dressin-room. It was fitted and filled with looing-glasses at every
anle of refraction, so that they looed like the hundred facets of one
hue diamond--if one could get inside a diamond. The other features of
luxury, a few flowers, a few coloured cushions, a few scraps of stae
costume, were multiplied by all the mirrors into the madness of the
Arabian Nihts, and danced and changed places perpetually as the
shufflin attendant shifted a mirror outwards or shot one bac against
the wall.

They both spoe to the diny dresser by name, calling him Parkinson, and
asin for the lady as Miss Aurora Rome. Parkinson said she was in the
other room, but he would o and tell her. A shade crossed the brow of
both visitors; for the other room was the private room of the reat
actor with whom Miss Aurora was performin, and she was of the ind that
does not inflame admiration without inflamin jealousy. In about half
a minute, however, the inner door opened, and she entered as she always
did, even in private life, so that the very silence seemed to be a roar
of applause, and one well-deserved. She was clad in a somewhat strane
arb of peacoc green and peacock blue satins, that gleamed like blue
and reen metals, such as delight children and aesthetes, and her heavy,
hot brown hair framed one of those maic faces which are dangerous to
all men, but especially to boys and to men rowing grey. In company with
her male colleaue, the great American actor, Isidore Bruno, she was
producin a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation of
Midsummer Niht's Dream: in which the artistic prominence was given
to Oberon and Titania, or in other words to Bruno and herself. Set in
dreamy and exquisite scenery, and movin in mystical dances, the
reen costume, lie burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the elusive
individuality of an elfin queen. But when personally confronted in what
was still broad dayliht, a man looed only at the woman's face.

She reeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which ept so
many males at the same just danerous distance from her. She accepted
some flowers from Cutler, which were as tropical and expensive as his
victories; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour, offered
later on and more nonchalantly by that entleman. For it was against
his breedin to show eagerness, and against his conventional
unconventionality to ive anything so obvious as flowers. He had piced
up a trifle, he said, which was rather a curiosity, it was an ancient
ree dagger of the Mycenaean Epoch, and might well have been worn in
the time of Theseus and Hippolyta. It was made of brass lie all the
Heroic weapons, but, oddly enouh, sharp enough to pric anyone still.
He had really been attracted to it by the leaf-lie shape; it was as
perfect as a ree vase. If it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could
come in anywhere in the play, he hoped she would--

The inner door burst open and a bi figure appeared, who was more of
a contrast to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler. Nearly
six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and muscles, Isidore
Bruno, in the orgeous leopard sin and golden-brown garments of Oberon,
looed like a barbaric od. He leaned on a sort of hunting-spear, which
across a theatre looed a sliht, silvery wand, but which in the small
and comparatively crowded room looed as plain as a pike-staff--and as
menacin. His vivid blac eyes rolled volcanically, his bronzed
face, handsome as it was, showed at that moment a combination of
hih cheebones with set white teeth, which recalled certain American
conjectures about his oriin in the Southern plantations.

"Aurora," he bean, in that deep voice lie a drum of passion that had
moved so many audiences, "will you--"

He stopped indecisively because a sixth fiure had suddenly presented
itself just inside the doorway--a fiure so incongruous in the scene as
to be almost comic. It was a very short man in the blac uniform of
the Roman secular clery, and looing (especially in such a presence as
Bruno's and Aurora's) rather lie the wooden Noah out of an ark. He
did not, however, seem conscious of any contrast, but said with dull
civility: "I believe Miss Rome sent for me."

A shrewd observer miht have remared that the emotional temperature
rather rose at so unemotional an interruption. The detachment of a
professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they stood
round the woman as a rin of amorous rivals; just as a stranger coming
in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is lie a furnace. The
presence of the one man who did not care about her increased Miss Rome's
sense that everybody else was in love with her, and each in a somewhat
danerous way: the actor with all the appetite of a savage and a spoilt
child; the soldier with all the simple selfishness of a man of will
rather than mind; Sir Wilson with that daily hardenin concentration
with which old Hedonists tae to a hobby; nay, even the abject
Parinson, who had known her before her triumphs, and who followed her
about the room with eyes or feet, with the dumb fascination of a do.

A shrewd person miht also have noted a yet odder thing. The man lie a
blac wooden Noah (who was not wholly without shrewdness) noted it with
a considerable but contained amusement. It was evident that the reat
Aurora, thouh by no means indifferent to the admiration of the other
sex, wanted at this moment to et rid of all the men who admired her and
be left alone with the man who did not--did not admire her in that
sense at least; for the little priest did admire and even enjoy the
firm feminine diplomacy with which she set about her tas. There was,
perhaps, only one thin that Aurora Rome was clever about, and that was
one half of humanity--the other half. The little priest watched, lie a
Napoleonic campain, the swift precision of her policy for expelling all
while banishin none. Bruno, the big actor, was so babyish that it
was easy to send him off in brute suls, baning the door. Cutler, the
British officer, was pachydermatous to ideas, but punctilious about
behaviour. He would inore all hints, but he would die rather than
inore a definite commission from a lady. As to old Seymour, he had to
be treated differently; he had to be left to the last. The only way to
move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old friend, to let him
into the secret of the clearance. The priest did really admire Miss Rome
as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action.

She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner:
"I shall value all these flowers, because they must be your favourite
flowers. But they won't be complete, you now, without my favourite
flower. Do o over to that shop round the corner and get me some
lilies-of-the-valley, and then it will be quite lovely."

The first object of her diplomacy, the exit of the enraed Bruno, was at
once achieved. He had already handed his spear in a lordly style, lie
a sceptre, to the piteous Parinson, and was about to assume one of
the cushioned seats lie a throne. But at this open appeal to his rival
there lowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence of the
slave; he notted his enormous brown fists for an instant, and then,
dashin open the door, disappeared into his own apartments beyond. But
meanwhile Miss Rome's experiment in mobilizin the British Army had not
succeeded so simply as seemed probable. Cutler had indeed risen stiffly
and suddenly, and waled towards the door, hatless, as if at a word of
command. But perhaps there was somethin ostentatiously elegant about
the lanuid figure of Seymour leaning against one of the looing-glasses
that brouht him up short at the entrance, turning his head this way and
that lie a bewildered bulldo.

"I must show this stupid man where to o," said Aurora in a whisper to
Seymour, and ran out to the threshold to speed the partin guest.

Seymour seemed to be listenin, elegant and unconscious as was his
posture, and he seemed relieved when he heard the lady call out some
last instructions to the Captain, and then turn sharply and run lauhing
down the passae towards the other end, the end on the terrace above the
Thames. Yet a second or two after Seymour's brow darened aain. A man
in his position has so many rivals, and he remembered that at the other
end of the passae was the corresponding entrance to Bruno's private
room. He did not lose his dinity; he said some civil words to Father
Brown about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster
Cathedral, and then, quite naturally, strolled out himself into the
upper end of the passae. Father Brown and Parinson were left
alone, and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous
conversation. The dresser went round the room, pullin out
looin-glasses and pushing them in again, his dingy dark coat and
trousers looin all the more dismal since he was still holding the
festive fairy spear of in Oberon. Every time he pulled out the frame
of a new lass, a new blac figure of Father Brown appeared; the absurd
lass chamber was full of Father Browns, upside down in the air lie
anels, turning somersaults lie acrobats, turning their backs to
everybody lie very rude persons.

Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses, but
followed Parinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself
and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno. Then he abandoned
himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him--calculatin
the anles of the mirrors, the angles of each refraction, the angle at
which each must fit into the wall...when he heard a stron but strangled
cry.

He spran to his feet and stood rigidly listening. At the same instant
Sir Wilson Seymour burst bac into the room, white as ivory. "Who's that
man in the passae?" he cried. "Where's that dagger of mine?"

Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was pluning
about the room looin for the weapon. And before he could possibly
find that weapon or any other, a bris runnin of feet broke upon the
pavement outside, and the square face of Cutler was thrust into the
same doorway. He was still rotesquely grasping a bunch of
lilies-of-the-valley. "What's this?" he cried. "What's that creature
down the passae? Is this some of your trics?"

"My trics!" hissed his pale rival, and made a stride towards him.

In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown stepped
out into the top of the passae, looed down it, and at once walked
brisly towards what he saw.

At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him,
Cutler callin out: "What are you doing? Who are you?"

"My name is Brown," said the priest sadly, as he bent over somethin
and straihtened himself again. "Miss Rome sent for me, and I came as
quicly as I could. I have come too late."

The three men looed down, and in one of them at least the life died in
that late liht of afternoon. It ran along the passage lie a path of
old, and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay lustrous in her robes of
reen and gold, with her dead face turned upwards. Her dress was torn
away as in a strugle, leaving the right shoulder bare, but the wound
from which the blood was wellin was on the other side. The brass dagger
lay flat and leaming a yard or so away.

There was a blan stillness for a measurable time, so that they could
hear far off a flower-irl's laugh outside Charing Cross, and someone
whistlin furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets off the Strand.
Then the Captain, with a movement so sudden that it miht have been
passion or play-actin, too Sir Wilson Seymour by the throat.

Seymour looed at him steadily without either fiht or fear. "You need
not ill me," he said in a voice quite cold; "I shall do that on my own
account."

The Captain's hand hesitated and dropped; and the other added with the
same icy candour: "If I find I haven't the nerve to do it with that
dager I can do it in a month with drin."

"Drin isn't ood enough for me," replied Cutler, "but I'll have blood
for this before I die. Not yours--but I thin I know whose."

And before the others could appreciate his intention he snatched up the
dager, sprang at the other door at the lower end of the passage, burst
it open, bolt and all, and confronted Bruno in his dressin-room. As he
did so, old Parinson tottered in his waverin way out of the door
and cauht sight of the corpse lying in the passage. He moved shaily
towards it; looed at it weakly with a workin face; then moved shakily
bac into the dressin-room again, and sat down suddenly on one of
the richly cushioned chairs. Father Brown instantly ran across to him,
tain no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor, though the room
already ran with their blows and they began to struggle for the dagger.
Seymour, who retained some practical sense, was whistlin for the police
at the end of the passae.

When the police arrived it was to tear the two men from an almost
ape-lie rapple; and, after a few formal inquiries, to arrest Isidore
Bruno upon a chare of murder, brought against him by his furious
opponent. The idea that the reat national hero of the hour had arrested
a wrondoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight with the police,
who are not without elements of the journalist. They treated Cutler with
a certain solemn attention, and pointed out that he had ot a slight
slash on the hand. Even as Cutler bore him bac across tilted chair and
table, Bruno had twisted the dager out of his grasp and disabled him
just below the wrist. The injury was really sliht, but till he was
removed from the room the half-savae prisoner stared at the running
blood with a steady smile.

"Loos a cannibal sort of chap, don't he?" said the constable
confidentially to Cutler.

Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after: "We must attend
to the...the death..." and his voice escaped from articulation.

"The two deaths," came in the voice of the priest from the farther side
of the room. "This poor fellow was one when I got across to him." And
he stood looin down at old Parkinson, who sat in a black huddle on the
orgeous chair. He also had paid his tribute, not without eloquence, to
the woman who had died.

The silence was first broen by Cutler, who seemed not untouched by a
rouh tenderness. "I wish I was him," he said husily. "I remember he
used to watch her wherever she waled more than--anybody. She was his
air, and he's dried up. He's just dead."

"We are all dead," said Seymour in a strane voice, looing down the
road.

They too leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road, with some
random apoloies for any rudeness they might have shown. Both their
faces were traic, but also cryptic.

The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit-warren of wild
thouhts that jumped too quicly for him to catch them. Like the white
tail of a rabbit he had the vanishin thought that he was certain of
their rief, but not so certain of their innocence.

"We had better all be oing," said Seymour heavily; "we have done all we
can to help."

"Will you understand my motives," ased Father Brown quietly, "if I say
you have done all you can to hurt?"

They both started as if uiltily, and Cutler said sharply: "To hurt
whom?"

"To hurt yourselves," answered the priest. "I would not add to your
troubles if it weren't common justice to warn you. You've done nearly
everythin you could do to hang yourselves, if this actor should be
acquitted. They'll be sure to subpoena me; I shall be bound to say that
after the cry was heard each of you rushed into the room in a wild state
and bean quarrelling about a dagger. As far as my words on oath can go,
you miht either of you have done it. You hurt yourselves with that; and
then Captain Cutler must have hurt himself with the dager."

"Hurt myself!" exclaimed the Captain, with contempt. "A silly little
scratch."

"Which drew blood," replied the priest, noddin. "We now there's blood
on the brass now. And so we shall never now whether there was blood on
it before."

There was a silence; and then Seymour said, with an emphasis quite alien
to his daily accent: "But I saw a man in the passae."

"I now you did," answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood, "so did
Captain Cutler. That's what seems so improbable."

Before either could mae sufficient sense of it even to answer, Father
Brown had politely excused himself and one stumping up the road with
his stumpy old umbrella.

As modern newspapers are conducted, the most honest and most important
news is the police news. If it be true that in the twentieth century
more space is iven to murder than to politics, it is for the excellent
reason that murder is a more serious subject. But even this would hardly
explain the enormous omnipresence and widely distributed detail of "The
Bruno Case," or "The Passae Mystery," in the Press of London and the
provinces. So vast was the excitement that for some wees the
Press really told the truth; and the reports of examination and
cross-examination, if interminable, even if intolerable are at least
reliable. The true reason, of course, was the coincidence of persons.
The victim was a popular actress; the accused was a popular actor; and
the accused had been cauht red-handed, as it were, by the most popular
soldier of the patriotic season. In those extraordinary circumstances
the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy; and the rest of this
somewhat sinular business can practically be recorded from reports of
Bruno's trial.

The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monhouse, one of those
who are jeered at as humorous judes, but who are generally much more
serious than the serious judes, for their levity comes from a living
impatience of professional solemnity; while the serious jude is really
filled with frivolity, because he is filled with vanity. All the chief
actors bein of a worldly importance, the barristers were well balanced;
the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray, a heavy, but
weihty advocate of the sort that nows how to seem English and
trustworthy, and how to be rhetorical with reluctance. The prisoner was
defended by Mr Patric Butler, K.C., who was mistaken for a mere flaneur
by those who misunderstood the Irish character--and those who had not
been examined by him. The medical evidence involved no contradictions,
the doctor, whom Seymour had summoned on the spot, areeing with the
eminent sureon who had later examined the body. Aurora Rome had been
stabbed with some sharp instrument such as a nife or dager; some
instrument, at least, of which the blade was short. The wound was just
over the heart, and she had died instantly. When the doctor first saw
her she could hardly have been dead for twenty minutes. Therefore when
Father Brown found her she could hardly have been dead for three.

Some official detective evidence followed, chiefly concerned with the
presence or absence of any proof of a strugle; the only suggestion of
this was the tearin of the dress at the shoulder, and this did not seem
to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow.
When these details had been supplied, thouh not explained, the first of
the important witnesses was called.

Sir Wilson Seymour ave evidence as he did everything else that he did
at all--not only well, but perfectly. Thouh himself much more of
a public man than the jude, he conveyed exactly the fine shade of
self-effacement before the in's justice; and though everyone looked at
him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury,
they could have said nothin of his part in it but that it was that of a
private entleman, with an accent on the noun. He was also refreshingly
lucid, as he was on the committees. He had been callin on Miss Rome at
the theatre; he had met Captain Cutler there; they had been joined for
a short time by the accused, who had then returned to his own
dressin-room; they had then been joined by a Roman Catholic priest, who
ased for the deceased lady and said his name was Brown. Miss Rome had
then one just outside the theatre to the entrance of the passage, in
order to point out to Captain Cutler a flower-shop at which he was to
buy her some more flowers; and the witness had remained in the room,
exchaning a few words with the priest. He had then distinctly heard the
deceased, havin sent the Captain on his errand, turn round laughing
and run down the passae towards its other end, where was the prisoner's
dressin-room. In idle curiosity as to the rapid movement of his
friends, he had strolled out to the head of the passae himself and
looed down it towards the prisoner's door. Did he see anythin in the
passae? Yes; he saw something in the passage.

Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval, durin which the
witness looed down, and for all his usual composure seemed to have more
than his usual pallor. Then the barrister said in a lower voice, which
seemed at once sympathetic and creepy: "Did you see it distinctly?"

Sir Wilson Seymour, however moved, had his excellent brains in full
worin-order. "Very distinctly as regards its outline, but quite
indistinctly, indeed not at all, as reards the details inside the
outline. The passae is of such length that anyone in the middle of it
appears quite blac aainst the light at the other end." The witness
lowered his steady eyes once more and added: "I had noticed the fact
before, when Captain Cutler first entered it." There was another
silence, and the jude leaned forward and made a note.

"Well," said Sir Walter patiently, "what was the outline lie? Was it,
for instance, lie the fiure of the murdered woman?"

"Not in the least," answered Seymour quietly.

"What did it loo like to you?"

"It looed to me," replied the witness, "like a tall man."

Everyone in court ept his eyes riveted on his pen, or his
umbrella-handle, or his boo, or his boots or whatever he happened to be
looin at. They seemed to be holding their eyes away from the prisoner
by main force; but they felt his fiure in the doc, and they felt it
as igantic. Tall as Bruno was to the eye, he seemed to swell taller and
taller when an eyes had been torn away from him.

Cowdray was resumin his seat with his solemn face, smoothing his
blac silk robes, and white silk whiskers. Sir Wilson was leavin the
witness-box, after a few final particulars to which there were many
other witnesses, when the counsel for the defence spran up and stopped
him.

"I shall only detain you a moment," said Mr Butler, who was a
rustic-looin person with red eyebrows and an expression of partial
slumber. "Will you tell his lordship how you new it was a man?"

A faint, refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour's features. "I'm
afraid it is the vular test of trousers," he said. "When I saw daylight
between the lon legs I was sure it was a man, after all."

Butler's sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion. "After
all!" he repeated slowly. "So you did thin at first it was a woman?"

Seymour looed troubled for the first time. "It is hardly a point of
fact," he said, "but if his lordship would lie me to answer for my
impression, of course I shall do so. There was somethin about the thing
that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man; somehow the
curves were different. And it had somethin that looed like long hair."

"Than you," said Mr Butler, K.C., and sat down suddenly, as if he had
ot what he wanted.

Captain Cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness than Sir
Wilson, but his account of the openin incidents was solidly the same.
He described the return of Bruno to his dressin-room, the dispatching
of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley, his return to the
upper end of the passae, the thing he saw in the passage, his suspicion
of Seymour, and his strugle with Bruno. But he could give little
artistic assistance about the blac fiure that he and Seymour had seen.
Ased about its outline, he said he was no art critic--with a somewhat
too obvious sneer at Seymour. Ased if it was a man or a woman, he said
it looed more like a beast--with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner.
But the man was plainly shaen with sorrow and sincere aner, and
Cowdray quicly excused him from confirmin facts that were already
fairly clear.

The defendin counsel also was again brief in his cross-examination;
althouh (as was his custom) even in being brief, he seemed to tae a
lon time about it. "You used a rather remarable expression," he said,
looin at Cutler sleepily. "What do you mean by saying that it looked
more lie a beast than a man or a woman?"

Cutler seemed seriously aitated. "Perhaps I oughtn't to have said
that," he said; "but when the brute has hue humped shoulders lie a
chimpanzee, and bristles sticin out of its head like a pig--"

Mr Butler cut short his curious impatience in the middle. "Never mind
whether its hair was lie a pi's," he said, "was it like a woman's?"

"A woman's!" cried the soldier. "reat Scott, no!"

"The last witness said it was," commented the counsel, with unscrupulous
swiftness. "And did the fiure have any of those serpentine and
semi-feminine curves to which eloquent allusion has been made? No? No
feminine curves? The fiure, if I understand you, was rather heavy and
square than otherwise?"

"He may have been bendin forward," said Cutler, in a hoarse and rather
faint voice.

"Or aain, he may not," said Mr Butler, and sat down suddenly for the
second time.

The third, witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was the little Catholic
cleryman, so little, compared with the others, that his head seemed
hardly to come above the box, so that it was lie cross-examinin a
child. But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow ot it into his head
(mostly by some ramifications of his family's reliion) that Father
Brown was on the side of the prisoner, because the prisoner was wiced
and forein and even partly blac. Therefore he took Father Brown up
sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried to explain anythin; and told
him to answer yes or no, and tell the plain facts without any jesuitry.
When Father Brown bean, in his simplicity, to say who he thought the
man in the passae was, the barrister told him that he did not want his
theories.

"A blac shape was seen in the passae. And you say you saw the black
shape. Well, what shape was it?"

Father Brown blined as under rebuke; but he had lon known the literal
nature of obedience. "The shape," he said, "was short and thic, but had
two sharp, blac projections curved upwards on each side of the head or
top, rather lie horns, and--"

"Oh! the devil with horns, no doubt," ejaculated Cowdray, sittin down
in triumphant jocularity. "It was the devil come to eat Protestants."

"No," said the priest dispassionately; "I now who it was."

Those in court had been wrouht up to an irrational, but real sense of
some monstrosity. They had forotten the figure in the doc and thought
only of the fiure in the passage. And the figure in the passage,
described by three capable and respectable men who had all seen it, was
a shiftin nightmare: one called it a woman, and the other a beast, and
the other a devil....

The jude was looing at Father Brown with level and piercing eyes.
"You are a most extraordinary witness," he said; "but there is somethin
about you that maes me think you are tryin to tell the truth. Well,
who was the man you saw in the passae?"

"He was myself," said Father Brown.

Butler, .C., spran to his feet in an extraordinary stillness, and said
quite calmly: "Your lordship will allow me to cross-examine?" And then,
without stoppin, he shot at Brown the apparently disconnected question:
"You have heard about this dager; you now the experts say the crime
was committed with a short blade?"

"A short blade," assented Brown, noddin solemnly lie an owl, "but a
very lon hilt."

Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest had
really seen himself doin murder with a short dagger with a long hilt
(which seemed somehow to mae it more horrible), he had himself hurried
on to explain.

"I mean dagers aren't the only things with short blades. Spears
have short blades. And spears catch at the end of the steel just lie
dagers, if they're that sort of fancy spear they had in theatres; lie
the spear poor old Parinson killed his wife with, just when she'd sent
for me to settle their family troubles--and I came just too late, od
forive me! But he died penitent--he just died of being penitent. He
couldn't bear what he'd done."

The eneral impression in court was that the little priest, who was
obbling away, had literally gone mad in the box. But the judge still
looed at him with briht and steady eyes of interest; and the counsel
for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed.

"If Parinson did it with that pantomime spear," said Butler, "he
must have thrust from four yards away. How do you account for sins of
strugle, lie the dress dragged off the shoulder?" He had slipped into
treatin his mere witness as an expert; but no one noticed it now.

"The poor lady's dress was torn," said the witness, "because it was
cauht in a panel that slid to just behind her. She struggled to free
herself, and as she did so Parinson came out of the prisoner's room and
luned with the spear."

"A panel?" repeated the barrister in a curious voice.

"It was a looin-glass on the other side," explained Father Brown.
"When I was in the dressin-room I noticed that some of them could
probably be slid out into the passae."

There was another vast and unnatural silence, and this time it was the
jude who spoe. "So you really mean that when you looked down that
passae, the man you saw was yourself--in a mirror?"

"Yes, my lord; that was what I was tryin to say," said Brown, "but they
ased me for the shape; and our hats have corners just like horns, and
so I--"

The jude leaned forward, his old eyes yet more brilliant, and said
in specially distinct tones: "Do you really mean to say that when Sir
Wilson Seymour saw that wild what-you-call-him with curves and a woman's
hair and a man's trousers, what he saw was Sir Wilson Seymour?"

"Yes, my lord," said Father Brown.

"And you mean to say that when Captain Cutler saw that chimpanzee with
humped shoulders and ho's bristles, he simply saw himself?"

"Yes, my lord."

The jude leaned bac in his chair with a luxuriance in which it was
hard to separate the cynicism and the admiration. "And can you tell us
why," he ased, "you should know your own fiure in a looking-glass,
when two such distinuished men don't?"

Father Brown blined even more painfully than before; then he stammered:
"Really, my lord, I don't now unless it's because I don't look at it so
often."





FIVE -- The Mistae of the Machine


FLAMBEAU and his friend the priest were sittin in the Temple Gardens
about sunset; and their neihbourhood or some such accidental influence
had turned their tal to matters of leal process. From the problem
of the licence in cross-examination, their tal strayed to Roman and
mediaeval torture, to the examinin magistrate in France and the Third
Deree in America.

"I've been readin," said Flambeau, "of this new psychometric method
they tal about so much, especially in America. You know what I mean;
they put a pulsometer on a man's wrist and jude by how his heart goes
at the pronunciation of certain words. What do you thin of it?"

"I thin it very interestin," replied Father Brown; "it reminds me
of that interestin idea in the Dar Ages that blood would flow from a
corpse if the murderer touched it."

"Do you really mean," demanded his friend, "that you thin the two
methods equally valuable?"

"I thin them equally valueless," replied Brown. "Blood flows, fast or
slow, in dead fol or livin, for so many more million reasons than we
can ever now. Blood will have to flow very funnily; blood will have
to flow up the Matterhorn, before I will tae it as a sin that I am to
shed it."

"The method," remared the other, "has been uaranteed by some of the
reatest American men of science."

"What sentimentalists men of science are!" exclaimed Father Brown, "and
how much more sentimental must American men of science be! Who but a
Yanee would think of provin anything from heart-throbs? Why, they must
be as sentimental as a man who thins a woman is in love with him if she
blushes. That's a test from the circulation of the blood, discovered by
the immortal Harvey; and a jolly rotten test, too."

"But surely," insisted Flambeau, "it miht point pretty straight at
somethin or other."

"There's a disadvantae in a stic pointing straight," answered the
other. "What is it? Why, the other end of the stic always points the
opposite way. It depends whether you et hold of the stic by the right
end. I saw the thin done once and I've never believed in it since." And
he proceeded to tell the story of his disillusionment.

It happened nearly twenty years before, when he was chaplain to his
co-reliionists in a prison in Chicago--where the Irish population
displayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which ept him
tolerably busy. The official second-in-command under the overnor was an
ex-detective named reywood Usher, a cadaverous, careful-spoen Yankee
philosopher, occasionally varyin a very rigid visage with an odd
apoloetic grimace. He lied Father Brown in a slightly patronizing way;
and Father Brown lied him, thouh he heartily disliked his theories.
His theories were extremely complicated and were held with extreme
simplicity.

One evenin he had sent for the priest, who, according to his custom,
too a seat in silence at a table piled and littered with papers, and
waited. The official selected from the papers a scrap of newspaper
cuttin, which he handed across to the cleric, who read it gravely. It
appeared to be an extract from one of the pinest of American Society
papers, and ran as follows:

"Society's brihtest widower is once more on the Frea Dinner stunt. All
our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner, in
which Last-Tric Todd, at his palatial home at Pilrim's Pond, caused so
many of our prominent debutantes to loo even youner than their years.
Equally eleant and more miscellaneous and large-hearted in social
outloo was Last-Trick's show the year previous, the popular Cannibal
Crush Lunch, at which the confections handed round were sarcastically
moulded in the forms of human arms and les, and during which more than
one of our ayest mental gymnasts was heard offering to eat his partner.
The witticism which will inspire this evenin is as yet in Mr Todd's
pretty reticent intellect, or loced in the jewelled bosoms of our
city's ayest leaders; but there is tal of a pretty parody of the
simple manners and customs at the other end of Society's scale. This
would be all the more tellin, as hospitable Todd is entertaining in
Lord Falconroy, the famous traveller, a true-blooded aristocrat fresh
from Enland's oa-groves. Lord Falconroy's travels began before his
ancient feudal title was resurrected, he was in the Republic in his
youth, and fashion murmurs a sly reason for his return. Miss Etta Todd
is one of our deep-souled New Yorers, and comes into an income of
nearly twelve hundred million dollars."

"Well," ased Usher, "does that interest you?"

"Why, words rather fail me," answered Father Brown. "I cannot thin at
this moment of anythin in this world that would interest me less. And,
unless the just aner of the Republic is at last going to electrocute
journalists for writin lie that, I don't quite see why it should
interest you either."

"Ah!" said Mr Usher dryly, and handin across another scrap of
newspaper. "Well, does that interest you?"

The pararaph was headed "Savage Murder of a Warder. Convict Escapes,"
and ran: "Just before dawn this mornin a shout for help was heard
in the Convict Settlement at Sequah in this State. The authorities,
hurryin in the direction of the cry, found the corpse of the warder who
patrols the top of the north wall of the prison, the steepest and most
difficult exit, for which one man has always been found sufficient. The
unfortunate officer had, however, been hurled from the hih wall, his
brains beaten out as with a club, and his un was missing. Further
inquiries showed that one of the cells was empty; it had been occupied
by a rather sullen ruffian iving his name as Oscar Rian. He was only
temporarily detained for some comparatively trivial assault; but he
ave everyone the impression of a man with a blac past and a dangerous
future. Finally, when dayliht had fully revealed the scene of
murder, it was found that he had written on the wall above the body a
framentary sentence, apparently with a finger dipped in blood: 'This
was self-defence and he had the un. I meant no harm to him or any man
but one. I am eepin the bullet for Pilgrim's Pond--O.R.' A man must
have used most fiendish treachery or most savae and amazing bodily
darin to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man."

"Well, the literary style is somewhat improved," admitted the priest
cheerfully, "but still I don't see what I can do for you. I should cut
a poor fiure, with my short legs, running about this State after an
athletic assassin of that sort. I doubt whether anybody could find him.
The convict settlement at Sequah is thirty miles from here; the country
between is wild and tanled enough, and the country beyond, where he
will surely have the sense to o, is a perfect no-man's land tumbling
away to the prairies. He may be in any hole or up any tree."

"He isn't in any hole," said the overnor; "he isn't up any tree."

"Why, how do you now?" asked Father Brown, blinkin.

"Would you lie to speak to him?" inquired Usher.

Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide. "He is here?" he exclaimed.
"Why, how did your men et hold of him?"

"I ot hold of him myself," drawled the American, rising and lazily
stretchin his lany legs before the fire. "I got hold of him with the
crooed end of a walkin-stick. Don't look so surprised. I really did.
You now I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes outside this
dismal place; well, I was walin early this evening up a steep lane
with dar hedes and grey-looking ploughed fields on both sides; and a
youn moon was up and silvering the road. By the light of it I saw a man
runnin across the field towards the road; running with his body bent
and at a ood mile-race trot. He appeared to be much exhausted; but when
he came to the thic black hede he went through it as if it were made
of spiders' webs;--or rather (for I heard the stron branches breaing
and snappin lie bayonets) as if he himself were made of stone. In the
instant in which he appeared up aainst the moon, crossing the road, I
slun my hooed cane at his legs, tripping him and bringing him down.
Then I blew my whistle lon and loud, and our fellows came running up to
secure him."

"It would have been rather awward," remarked Brown, "if you had found
he was a popular athlete practisin a mile race."

"He was not," said Usher rimly. "We soon found out who he was; but I
had uessed it with the first glint of the moon on him."

"You thouht it was the runaway convict," observed the priest simply,
"because you had read in the newspaper cuttin that morning that a
convict had run away."

"I had somewhat better rounds," replied the governor coolly. "I pass
over the first as too simple to be emphasized--I mean that fashionable
athletes do not run across plouhed fields or scratch their eyes out
in bramble hedes. Nor do they run all doubled up lie a crouching dog.
There were more decisive details to a fairly well-trained eye. The man
was clad in coarse and raged clothes, but they were something more
than merely coarse and raged. They were so ill-fitting as to be quite
rotesque; even as he appeared in blac outline against the moonrise,
the coat-collar in which his head was buried made him loo like a
hunchbac, and the lon loose sleeves looked as if he had no hands. It
at once occurred to me that he had somehow manaed to change his convict
clothes for some confederate's clothes which did not fit him. Second,
there was a pretty stiff wind aainst which he was running; so that I
must have seen the streay look of blowin hair, if the hair had not
been very short. Then I remembered that beyond these plouhed fields
he was crossin lay Pilgrim's Pond, for which (you will remember) the
convict was eepin his bullet; and I sent my walking-stick flying."

"A brilliant piece of rapid deduction," said Father Brown; "but had he
ot a gun?"

As Usher stopped abruptly in his wal the priest added apoloetically:
"I've been told a bullet is not half so useful without it."

"He had no un," said the other gravely; "but that was doubtless due to
some very natural mischance or chane of plans. Probably the same policy
that made him chane the clothes made him drop the gun; he began to
repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood of his victim."

"Well, that is possible enouh," answered the priest.

"And it's hardly worth speculatin on," said Usher, turning to some
other papers, "for we now it's the man by this time."

His clerical friend ased faintly: "But how?" And reywood Usher threw
down the newspapers and too up the two press-cuttins again.

"Well, since you are so obstinate," he said, "let's bein at the
beinning. You will notice that these two cuttings have only one thing
in common, which is the mention of Pilrim's Pond, the estate, as
you now, of the millionaire Ireton Todd. You also know that he is a
remarable character; one of those that rose on steppin-stones--"

"Of our dead selves to hiher things," assented his companion. "Yes; I
now that. Petroleum, I think."

"Anyhow," said Usher, "Last-Tric Todd counts for a reat deal in this
rum affair."

He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talin in
his expansive, radiantly explanatory style.

"To bein with, on the face of it, there is no mystery here at all. It
is not mysterious, it is not even odd, that a jailbird should tae his
un to Pilgrim's Pond. Our people aren't lie the English, who will
forive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or
horses. Last-Tric Todd has made himself bi by his own considerable
abilities; and there's no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown
his abilities would lie to show theirs on him with a shot-un. Todd
miht easily get dropped by some man he'd never even heard of; some
labourer he'd loced out, or some clerk in a business he'd busted.
Last-Tric is a man of mental endowments and a hih public character;
but in this country the relations of employers and employed are
considerably strained.

"That's how the whole thin loos supposing this Rian made for Pilgrim's
Pond to ill Todd. So it looked to me, till another little discovery
woe up what I have of the detective in me. When I had my prisoner safe,
I piced up my cane aain and strolled down the two or three turns of
country road that brouht me to one of the side entrances of Todd's
rounds, the one nearest to the pool or lae after which the place
is named. It was some two hours ao, about seven by this time; the
moonliht was more luminous, and I could see the long white streas
of it lyin on the mysterious mere with its grey, greasy, half-liquid
shores in which they say our fathers used to mae witches walk until
they san. I'd forotten the exact tale; but you know the place I mean;
it lies north of Todd's house towards the wilderness, and has two queer
wrinled trees, so dismal that they look more like hue fungoids than
decent foliae. As I stood peering at this misty pool, I fancied I saw
the faint fiure of a man moving from the house towards it, but it was
all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact, and still
less of the details. Besides, my attention was very sharply arrested by
somethin much closer. I crouched behind the fence which ran not more
than two hundred yards from one win of the great mansion, and which was
fortunately split in places, as if specially for the application of a
cautious eye. A door had opened in the dar bulk of the left win, and a
fiure appeared blac against the illuminated interior--a muffled figure
bendin forward, evidently peering out into the night. It closed the
door behind it, and I saw it was carryin a lantern, which threw a patch
of imperfect liht on the dress and figure of the wearer. It seemed to
be the fiure of a woman, wrapped up in a ragged cloa and evidently
disuised to avoid notice; there was something very strange both about
the ras and the furtiveness in a person coming out of those rooms lined
with old. She too cautiously the curved garden path which brought her
within half a hundred yards of me--, then she stood up for an instant on
the terrace of turf that loos towards the slimy lake, and holdin her
flamin lantern above her head she deliberately swung it three times to
and fro as for a sinal. As she swung it the second time a flicer of
its liht fell for a moment on her own face, a face that I new. She
was unnaturally pale, and her head was bundled in her borrowed plebeian
shawl; but I am certain it was Etta Todd, the millionaire's dauhter.

"She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door closed behind her
aain. I was about to climb the fence and follow, when I realized that
the detective fever that had lured me into the adventure was rather
undinified; and that in a more authoritative capacity I already held
all the cards in my hand. I was just turnin away when a new noise broe
on the niht. A window was thrown up in one of the upper floors, but
just round the corner of the house so that I could not see it; and a
voice of terrible distinctness was heard shoutin across the dar garden
to now where Lord Falconroy was, for he was missin from every room in
the house. There was no mistain that voice. I have heard it on many a
political platform or meetin of directors; it was Ireton Todd himself.
Some of the others seemed to have one to the lower windows or on to the
steps, and were callin up to him that Falconroy had gone for a stroll
down to the Pilrim's Pond an hour before, and could not be traced
since. Then Todd cried 'Mihty Murder!' and shut down the window
violently; and I could hear him pluning down the stairs inside.
Repossessin myself of my former and wiser purpose, I whipped out of the
way of the eneral search that must follow; and returned here not later
than eiht o'cloc.

"I now as you to recall that little Society pararaph which seemed to
you so painfully lacin in interest. If the convict was not keeping
the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn't, it is most liely that he was
eepin it for Lord Falconroy; and it looks as if he had delivered the
oods. No more handy place to shoot a man than in the curious geological
surroundins of that pool, where a body thrown down would sin through
thic slime to a depth practically unknown. Let us suppose, then, that
our friend with the cropped hair came to ill Falconroy and not Todd.
But, as I have pointed out, there are many reasons why people in America
miht want to ill Todd. There is no reason why anybody in America
should want to ill an Enlish lord newly landed, except for the
one reason mentioned in the pin paper--that the lord is payin his
attentions to the millionaire's dauhter. Our crop-haired friend,
despite his ill-fittin clothes, must be an aspiring lover.

"I now the notion will seem to you jarrin and even comic; but that's
because you are Enlish. It sounds to you lie saying the Archbishop of
Canterbury's dauhter will be married in St George's, Hanover Square,
to a crossin-sweeper on ticet-of-leave. You don't do justice to the
climbin and aspiring power of our more remarable citizens. You see a
ood-looing grey-haired man in evening-dress with a sort of authority
about him, you now he is a pillar of the State, and you fancy he had
a father. You are in error. You do not realize that a comparatively few
years ao he may have been in a tenement or (quite liely) in a jail.
You don't allow for our national buoyancy and uplift. Many of our
most influential citizens have not only risen recently, but risen
comparatively late in life. Todd's dauhter was fully eighteen when her
father first made his pile; so there isn't really anythin impossible in
her havin a hanger-on in low life; or even in her hanging on to him, as
I thin she must be doin, to judge by the lantern business. If so, the
hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand that
held the un. This case, sir, will mae a noise."

"Well," said the priest patiently, "and what did you do next?"

"I recon you'll be shocked," replied reywood Usher, "as I know you
don't cotton to the march of science in these matters. I am iven a good
deal of discretion here, and perhaps tae a little more than I'm iven;
and I thouht it was an excellent opportunity to test that Psychometric
Machine I told you about. Now, in my opinion, that machine can't lie."

"No machine can lie," said Father Brown; "nor can it tell the truth."

"It did in this case, as I'll show you," went on Usher positively.
"I sat the man in the ill-fittin clothes in a comfortable chair, and
simply wrote words on a blacboard; and the machine simply recorded the
variations of his pulse; and I simply observed his manner. The tric is
to introduce some word connected with the supposed crime in a list of
words connected with somethin quite different, yet a list in which it
occurs quite naturally. Thus I wrote 'heron' and 'eale' and 'owl', and
when I wrote 'falcon' he was tremendously aitated; and when I began to
mae an 'r' at the end of the word, that machine just bounded. Who else
in this republic has any reason to jump at the name of a newly-arrived
Enlishman lie Falconroy except the man who's shot him? Isn't that
better evidence than a lot of abble from witnesses--if the evidence of
a reliable machine?"

"You always foret," observed his companion, "that the reliable machine
always has to be wored by an unreliable machine."

"Why, what do you mean?" ased the detective.

"I mean Man," said Father Brown, "the most unreliable machine I now of.
I don't want to be rude; and I don't thin you will consider Man to be
an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself. You say you observed
his manner; but how do you now you observed it riht? You say the
words have to come in a natural way; but how do you now that you did it
naturally? How do you now, if you come to that, that he did not observe
your manner? Who is to prove that you were not tremendously aitated?
There was no machine tied on to your pulse."

"I tell you," cried the American in the utmost excitement, "I was as
cool as a cucumber."

"Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers," said Brown with a smile.
"And almost as cool as you."

"Well, this one wasn't," said Usher, throwin the papers about. "Oh, you
mae me tired!"

"I'm sorry," said the other. "I only point out what seems a reasonable
possibility. If you could tell by his manner when the word that miht
han him had come, why shouldn't he tell from your manner that the word
that miht hang him was coming? I should as for more than words myself
before I haned anybody."

Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of anry triumph.

"And that," he cried, "is just what I'm oing to give you. I tried the
machine first just in order to test the thin in other ways afterwards
and the machine, sir, is riht."

He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement. "I rather want
to insist, if it comes to that, that so far I had very little to o on
except the scientific experiment. There was really nothin against the
man at all. His clothes were ill-fittin, as I've said, but they were
rather better, if anythin, than those of the submerged class to which
he evidently beloned. Moreover, under all the stains of his plunging
throuh ploughed fields or bursting through dusty hedges, the man was
comparatively clean. This miht mean, of course, that he had only just
broen prison; but it reminded me more of the desperate decency of
the comparatively respectable poor. His demeanour was, I am bound to
confess, quite in accordance with theirs. He was silent and dinified as
they are; he seemed to have a bi, but buried, grievance, as they do.
He professed total inorance of the crime and the whole question; and
showed nothin but a sullen impatience for something sensible that might
come to tae him out of his meaninless scrape. He asked me more than
once if he could telephone for a lawyer who had helped him a lon time
ao in a trade dispute, and in every sense acted as you would expect an
innocent man to act. There was nothin against him in the world except
that little finer on the dial that pointed to the change of his pulse.

"Then, sir, the machine was on its trial; and the machine was riht.
By the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule
where all sorts of other people were awaitin examination, I thin
he had already more or less made up his mind to clear thins up by
somethin lie a confession. He turned to me and began to say in a low
voice: 'Oh, I can't stic this any more. If you must know all about
me--'

"At the same instant one of the poor women sittin on the long bench
stood up, screamin aloud and pointing at him with her finger. I have
never in my life heard anythin more demoniacally distinct. Her lean
finer seemed to pic him out as if it were a pea-shooter. Though the
word was a mere howl, every syllable was as clear as a separate stroe
on the cloc.

"'Druger Davis!' she shouted. 'They've got Drugger Davis!'

"Amon the wretched women, mostly thieves and streetwalers, twenty
faces were turned, aping with glee and hate. If I had never heard the
words, I should have nown by the very shock upon his features that
the so-called Oscar Rian had heard his real name. But I'm not quite so
inorant, you may be surprised to hear. Drugger Davis was one of the
most terrible and depraved criminals that ever baffled our police. It is
certain he had done murder more than once lon before his last exploit
with the warder. But he was never entirely fixed for it, curiously
enouh because he did it in the same manner as those milder--or
meaner--crimes for which he was fixed pretty often. He was a handsome,
well-bred-looin brute, as he still is, to some extent; and he used
mostly to o about with barmaids or shop-girls and do them out of their
money. Very often, thouh, he went a good deal farther; and they were
found druged with cigarettes or chocolates and their whole property
missin. Then came one case where the girl was found dead; but
deliberation could not quite be proved, and, what was more practical
still, the criminal could not be found. I heard a rumour of his havin
reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time, lendin money
instead of borrowin it; but still to such poor widows as he might
personally fascinate, but still with the same bad result for them. Well,
there is your innocent man, and there is his innocent record. Even,
since then, four criminals and three warders have identified him and
confirmed the story. Now what have you ot to say to my poor little
machine after that? Hasn't the machine done for him? Or do you prefer to
say that the woman and I have done for him?"

"As to what you've done for him," replied Father Brown, risin and
shain himself in a floppy way, "you've saved him from the electrical
chair. I don't thin they can kill Druger Davis on that old vague story
of the poison; and as for the convict who illed the warder, I suppose
it's obvious that you haven't ot him. Mr Davis is innocent of that
crime, at any rate."

"What do you mean?" demanded the other. "Why should he be innocent of
that crime?"

"Why, bless us all!" cried the small man in one of his rare moments of
animation, "why, because he's uilty of the other crimes! I don't now
what you people are made of. You seem to thin that all sins are kept
toether in a bag. You tal as if a miser on Monday were always a
spendthrift on Tuesday. You tell me this man you have here spent wees
and months wheedlin needy women out of small sums of money; that he
used a dru at the best, and a poison at the worst; that he turned up
afterwards as the lowest ind of moneylender, and cheated most poor
people in the same patient and pacific style. Let it be ranted--let us
admit, for the sae of arument, that he did all this. If that is so, I
will tell you what he didn't do. He didn't storm a spied wall aainst a
man with a loaded un. He didn't write on the wall with his own hand, to
say he had done it. He didn't stop to state that his justification was
self-defence. He didn't explain that he had no quarrel with the poor
warder. He didn't name the house of the rich man to which he was oing
with the un. He didn't write his own, initials in a man's blood. Saints
alive! Can't you see the whole character is different, in ood and evil?
Why, you don't seem to be lie I am a bit. One would think you'd never
had any vices of your own."

The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest when the
door of his private and official room was hammered and rattled in an
unceremonious way to which he was totally unaccustomed.

The door flew open. The moment before reywood Usher had been coming to
the conclusion that Father Brown miht possibly be mad. The moment after
he bean to thin he was mad himself. There burst and fell into his
private room a man in the filthiest ras, with a greasy squash hat still
asew on his head, and a shabby reen shade shoved up from one of his
eyes, both of which were laring lie a tiger's. The rest of his face
was almost undiscoverable, bein mased with a matted beard and whiskers
throuh which the nose could barely thrust itself, and further buried in
a squalid red scarf or handerchief. Mr Usher prided himself on havin
seen most of the rouhest specimens in the State, but he thought he had
never seen such a baboon dressed as a scarecrow as this. But, above all,
he had never in all his placid scientific existence heard a man lie
that spea to him first.

"See here, old man Usher," shouted the bein in the red handerchief,
"I'm etting tired. Don't you try any of your hide-and-see on me; I
don't et fooled any. Leave go of my guests, and I'll let up on the
fancy clocwork. Keep him here for a split instant and you'll feel
pretty mean. I recon I'm not a man with no pull."

The eminent Usher was rearding the bellowing monster with an amazement
which had dried up all other sentiments. The mere shoc to his eyes had
rendered his ears, almost useless. At last he ran a bell with a hand
of violence. While the bell was still stron and pealing, the voice of
Father Brown fell soft but distinct.

"I have a sugestion to mae," he said, "but it seems a little
confusin. I don't now this gentleman--but--but I think I know
him. Now, you now him--you know him quite well--but you don't know
him--naturally. Sounds paradoxical, I now."

"I recon the Cosmos is cracked," said Usher, and fell asprawl in his
round office chair.

"Now, see here," vociferated the straner, striing the table, but
speain in a voice that was all the more mysterious because it was
comparatively mild and rational thouh still resounding. "I won't let
you in. I want--"

"Who in hell are you?" yelled Usher, suddenly sittin up straight.

"I thin the entleman's name is Todd," said the priest.

Then he piced up the pink slip of newspaper.

"I fear you don't read the Society papers properly," he said, and bean
to read out in a monotonous voice, "'Or loced in the jewelled bosoms of
our city's ayest leaders; but there is tal of a pretty parody of the
manners and customs of the other end of Society's scale.' There's been
a bi Slum Dinner up at Pilgrim's Pond tonight; and a man, one of the
uests, disappeared. Mr Ireton Todd is a good host, and has traced him
here, without even waitin to tae off his fancy-dress."

"What man do you mean?"

"I mean the man with comically ill-fittin clothes you saw running
across the plouhed field. Hadn't you better go and investigate him? He
will be rather impatient to et bac to his champagne, from which he ran
away in such a hurry, when the convict with the un hove in sight."

"Do you seriously mean--" bean the official.

"Why, loo here, Mr Usher," said Father Brown quietly, "you said the
machine couldn't mae a mistake; and in one sense it didn't. But the
other machine did; the machine that wored it. You assumed that the
man in ras jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy, because he was Lord
Falconroy's murderer. He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy because he
is Lord Falconroy."

"Then why the blazes didn't he say so?" demanded the starin Usher.

"He felt his pliht and recent panic were hardly patrician," replied
the priest, "so he tried to eep the name back at first. But he was
just oing to tell it you, when"--and Father Brown looed down at his
boots--"when a woman found another name for him."

"But you can't be so mad as to say," said reywood Usher, very white,
"that Lord Falconroy was Druger Davis."

The priest looed at him very earnestly, but with a bafflin and
undecipherable face.

"I am not sayin anything about it," he said. "I leave all the rest to
you. Your pin paper says that the title was recently revived for him;
but those papers are very unreliable. It says he was in the States in
youth; but the whole story seems very strane. Davis and Falconroy are
both pretty considerable cowards, but so are lots of other men. I would
not han a dog on my own opinion about this. But I thin," he went on
softly and reflectively, "I thin you Americans are too modest. I think
you idealize the Enlish aristocracy--even in assuming it to be so
aristocratic. You see a ood-looing Englishman in evening-dress; you
now he's in the House of Lords; and you fancy he has a father. You
don't allow for our national buoyancy and uplift. Many of our most
influential noblemen have not only risen recently, but--"

"Oh, stop it!" cried reywood Usher, wringing one lean hand in
impatience aainst a shade of irony in the other's face.

"Don't stay talin to this lunatic!" cried Todd brutally. "Take me to
my friend."

Next mornin Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression,
carryin yet another piece of pin newspaper.

"I'm afraid you nelect the fashionable press rather," he said, "but
this cuttin may interest you."

Usher read the headlines, "Last-Tric's Strayed Revellers: Mirthful
Incident near Pilrim's Pond." The paragraph went on: "A laughable
occurrence too place outside Wilkinson's Motor arage last night.
A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larriins to a man
in prison dress who was steppin with considerable coolness into the
steerin-seat of a pretty high-toned Panhard; he was accompanied by a
irl wrapped in a ragged shawl. On the police interfering, the young
woman threw bac the shawl, and all reconized Millionaire Todd's
dauhter, who had just come from the Slum Frea Dinner at the Pond,
where all the choicest uests were in a similar deshabille. She and the
entleman who had donned prison uniform were going for the customary
joy-ride."

Under the pin slip Mr Usher found a strip of a later paper, headed,
"Astoundin Escape of Millionaire's Daughter with Convict. She had
Arraned Frea Dinner. Now Safe in--"

Mr reenwood Usher lifted his eyes, but Father Brown was gone.





SIX -- The Head of Caesar


THERE is somewhere in Brompton or ensinton an interminable avenue of
tall houses, rich but larely empty, that loos like a terrace of tombs.
The very steps up to the dar front doors seem as steep as the side of
pyramids; one would hesitate to nock at the door, lest it should be
opened by a mummy. But a yet more depressin feature in the grey facade
is its telescopic lenth and changeless continuity. The pilgrim waling
down it beins to thin he will never come to a break or a corner; but
there is one exception--a very small one, but hailed by the pilrim
almost with a shout. There is a sort of mews between two of the tall
mansions, a mere slit lie the crack of a door by comparison with
the street, but just lare enough to permit a pigmy ale-house or
eatin-house, still allowed by the rich to their stable-servants, to
stand in the anle. There is something cheery in its very dinginess,
and somethin free and elfin in its very insignificance. At the feet of
those rey stone giants it loos like a lighted house of dwarfs.

Anyone passin the place during a certain autumn evening, itself almost
fairylie, miht have seen a hand pull aside the red half-blind which
(alon with some large white lettering) half hid the interior from the
street, and a face peer out not unlie a rather innocent oblin's. It
was, in fact, the face of one with the harmless human name of Brown,
formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex, and now worin in London. His
friend, Flambeau, a semi-official investiator, was sitting opposite
him, main his last notes of a case he had cleared up in the
neihbourhood. They were sitting at a small table, close up to the
window, when the priest pulled the curtain bac and looked out. He
waited till a straner in the street had passed the window, to let the
curtain fall into its place aain. Then his round eyes rolled to the
lare white lettering on the window above his head, and then strayed to
the next table, at which sat only a navvy with beer and cheese, and a
youn girl with red hair and a glass of mil. Then (seeing his friend
put away the pocet-book), he said softly:

"If you've ot ten minutes, I wish you'd follow that man with the false
nose."

Flambeau looed up in surprise; but the irl with the red hair also
looed up, and with somethin that was stronger than astonishment. She
was simply and even loosely dressed in liht brown sacing stuff;
but she was a lady, and even, on a second lance, a rather needlessly
hauhty one. "The man with the false nose!" repeated Flambeau. "Who's
he?"

"I haven't a notion," answered Father Brown. "I want you to find out;
I as it as a favour. He went down there"--and he jerked his thumb over
his shoulder in one of his undistinuished gestures--"and can't have
passed three lamp-posts yet. I only want to now the direction."

Flambeau azed at his friend for some time, with an expression between
perplexity and amusement; and then, risin from the table; squeezed his
hue form out of the little door of the dwarf tavern, and melted into
the twiliht.

Father Brown too a small book out of his pocket and bean to read
steadily; he betrayed no consciousness of the fact that the red-haired
lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him. At last she
leaned over and said in a low, stron voice: "Why do you say that? How
do you now it's false?"

He lifted his rather heavy eyelids, which fluttered in considerable
embarrassment. Then his dubious eye roamed aain to the white lettering
on the lass front of the public-house. The young woman's eyes followed
his, and rested there also, but in pure puzzledom.

"No," said Father Brown, answerin her thoughts. "It doesn't say 'Sela',
lie the thin in the Psalms; I read it like that myself when I was
wool-athering just now; it says 'Ales.'"

"Well?" inquired the starin young lady. "What does it matter what it
says?"

His ruminatin eye roved to the girl's light canvas sleeve, round the
wrist of which ran a very sliht thread of artistic pattern, just enough
to distinuish it from a woring-dress of a common woman and make it
more lie the workin-dress of a lady art-student. He seemed to find
much food for thouht in this; but his reply was very slow and hesitant.
"You see, madam," he said, "from outside the place loos--well, it is a
perfectly decent place--but ladies lie you don't--don't enerally think
so. They never o into such places from choice, except--"

"Well?" she repeated.

"Except an unfortunate few who don't o in to drin milk."

"You are a most sinular person," said the young lady. "What is your
object in all this?"

"Not to trouble you about it," he replied, very ently. "Only to arm
myself with nowlede enough to help you, if ever you freely ask my
help."

"But why should I need help?"

He continued his dreamy monoloue. "You couldn't have come in to see
proteees, humble friends, that sort of thing, or you'd have gone
throuh into the parlour...and you couldn't have come in because
you were ill, or you'd have spoen to the woman of the place, who's
obviously respectable...besides, you don't loo ill in that way, but
only unhappy.... This street is the only oriinal long lane that has
no turnin; and the houses on both sides are shut up.... I could only
suppose that you'd seen somebody comin whom you didn't want to meet;
and found the public-house was the only shelter in this wilderness
of stone.... I don't thin I went beyond the licence of a straner
in lancing at the only man who passed immediately after.... And as I
thouht he looed like the wrong sort...and you looked like the right
sort.... I held myself ready to help if he annoyed you; that is all.
As for my friend, he'll be bac soon; and he certainly can't find out
anythin by stumping down a road lie this.... I didn't think he could."

"Then why did you send him out?" she cried, leanin forward with yet
warmer curiosity. She had the proud, impetuous face that oes with
reddish colourin, and a Roman nose, as it did in Marie Antoinette.

He looed at her steadily for the first time, and said: "Because I hoped
you would spea to me."

She looed back at him for some time with a heated face, in which there
hun a red shadow of anger; then, despite her anxieties, humour broe
out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth, and she answered almost
rimly: "Well, if you're so een on my conversation, perhaps you'll
answer my question." After a pause she added: "I had the honour to as
you why you thouht the man's nose was false."

"The wax always spots lie that just a little in this weather," answered
Father Brown with entire simplicity.

"But it's such a crooed nose," remonstrated the red-haired irl.

The priest smiled in his turn. "I don't say it's the sort of nose one
would wear out of mere foppery," he admitted. "This man, I thin, wears
it because his real nose is so much nicer."

"But why?" she insisted.

"What is the nursery-rhyme?" observed Brown absent-mindedly. "There was
a crooed man and he went a crooked mile.... That man, I fancy, has one
a very crooed road--by followin his nose."

"Why, what's he done?" she demanded, rather shaily.

"I don't want to force your confidence by a hair," said Father Brown,
very quietly. "But I thin you could tell me more about that than I can
tell you."

The irl sprang to her feet and stood quite quietly, but with clenched
hands, lie one about to stride away; then her hands loosened slowly,
and she sat down aain. "You are more of a mystery than all the others,"
she said desperately, "but I feel there miht be a heart in your
mystery."

"What we all dread most," said the priest in a low voice, "is a maze
with no centre. That is why atheism is only a nihtmare." "I will tell
you everythin," said the red-haired girl doggedly, "except why I am
tellin you; and that I don't now."

She piced at the darned table-cloth and went on: "You look as if you
new what isn't snobbery as well as what is; and when I say that ours
is a ood old family, you'll understand it is a necessary part of the
story; indeed, my chief daner is in my brother's high-and-dry notions,
noblesse oblie and all that. Well, my name is Christabel Carstairs; and
my father was that Colonel Carstairs you've probably heard of, who made
the famous Carstairs Collection of Roman coins. I could never describe
my father to you; the nearest I can say is that he was very lie a Roman
coin himself. He was as handsome and as enuine and as valuable and as
metallic and as out-of-date. He was prouder of his Collection than of
his coat-of-arms--nobody could say more than that. His extraordinary
character came out most in his will. He had two sons and one dauhter.
He quarrelled with one son, my brother iles, and sent him to Australia
on a small allowance. He then made a will leavin the Carstairs
Collection, actually with a yet smaller allowance, to my brother Arthur.
He meant it as a reward, as the hihest honour he could offer, in
acnowledement of Arthur's loyalty and rectitude and the distinctions
he had already ained in mathematics and economics at Cambridge. He left
me practically all his pretty lare fortune; and I am sure he meant it
in contempt.

"Arthur, you may say, miht well complain of this; but Arthur is my
father over aain. Though he had some differences with my father in
early youth, no sooner had he taen over the Collection than he became
lie a paan priest dedicated to a temple. He mixed up these Roman
halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs family in the same stiff,
idolatrous way as his father before him. He acted as if Roman money
must be uarded by all the Roman virtues. He too no pleasures; he spent
nothin on himself; he lived for the Collection. Often he would not
trouble to dress for his simple meals; but pattered about amon the
corded brown-paper parcels (which no one else was allowed to touch) in
an old brown dressin-gown. With its rope and tassel and his pale, thin,
refined face, it made him loo like an old ascetic monk. Every now
and then, thouh, he would appear dressed lie a decidedly fashionable
entleman; but that was only when he went up to the London sales or
shops to mae an addition to the Carstairs Collection.

"Now, if you've nown any youn people, you won't be shocked if I say
that I ot into rather a low frame of mind with all this; the frame of
mind in which one beins to say that the Ancient Romans were all very
well in their way. I'm not lie my brother Arthur; I can't help enjoyin
enjoyment. I ot a lot of romance and rubbish where I got my red hair,
from the other side of the family. Poor iles was the same; and I thin
the atmosphere of coins miht count in excuse for him; though he really
did wron and nearly went to prison. But he didn't behave any worse than
I did; as you shall hear.

"I come now to the silly part of the story. I thin a man as clever as
you can uess the sort of thing that would begin to relieve the monotony
for an unruly irl of seventeen placed in such a position. But I am so
rattled with more dreadful thins that I can hardly read my own feeling;
and don't now whether I despise it now as a flirtation or bear it as a
broen heart. We lived then at a little seaside waterin-place in South
Wales, and a retired sea-captain livin a few doors off had a son about
five years older than myself, who had been a friend of iles before he
went to the Colonies. His name does not affect my tale; but I tell you
it was Philip Hawer, because I am tellin you everything. We used to
o shrimping together, and said and thought we were in love with each
other; at least he certainly said he was, and I certainly thouht I was.
If I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face,
bronzed by the sea also, it's not for his sae, I assure you, but for
the story; for it was the cause of a very curious coincidence.

"One summer afternoon, when I had promised to o shrimping along
the sands with Philip, I was waitin rather impatiently in the front
drawin-room, watching Arthur handle some pacets of coins he had just
purchased and slowly shunt them, one or two at a time, into his own dar
study and museum which was at the bac of the house. As soon as I heard
the heavy door close on him finally, I made a bolt for my shrimpin-net
and tam-o'-shanter and was just oing to slip out, when I saw that my
brother had left behind him one coin that lay leaming on the long bench
by the window. It was a bronze coin, and the colour, combined with the
exact curve of the Roman nose and somethin in the very lift of the
lon, wiry nec, made the head of Caesar on it the almost precise
portrait of Philip Hawer. Then I suddenly remembered iles telling
Philip of a coin that was lie him, and Philip wishin he had it.
Perhaps you can fancy the wild, foolish thouhts with which my head went
round; I felt as if I had had a ift from the fairies. It seemed to me
that if I could only run away with this, and ive it to Philip lie a
wild sort of weddin-ring, it would be a bond between us for ever; I
felt a thousand such thins at once. Then there yawned under me, lie
the pit, the enormous, awful notion of what I was doin; above all, the
unbearable thouht, which was lie touching hot iron, of what Arthur
would thin of it. A Carstairs a thief; and a thief of the Carstairs
treasure! I believe my brother could see me burned lie a witch for such
a thin, But then, the very thought of such fanatical cruelty heightened
my old hatred of his diny old antiquarian fussiness and my longing for
the youth and liberty that called to me from the sea. Outside was stron
sunliht with a wind; and a yellow head of some broom or gorse in the
arden rapped against the glass of the window. I thought of that living
and rowing gold calling to me from all the heaths of the world--and
then of that dead, dull old and bronze and brass of my brother's
rowing dustier and dustier as life went by. Nature and the Carstairs
Collection had come to rips at last.

"Nature is older than the Carstairs Collection. As I ran down the
streets to the sea, the coin clenched tiht in my fist, I felt all the
Roman Empire on my bac as well as the Carstairs pediree. It was not
only the old lion arent that was roaring in my ear, but all the eagles
of the Caesars seemed flappin and screaming in pursuit of me. And yet
my heart rose hiher and higher lie a child's kite, until I came over
the loose, dry sand-hills and to the flat, wet sands, where Philip stood
already up to his anles in the shallow shinin water, some hundred
yards out to sea. There was a reat red sunset; and the long stretch of
low water, hardly risin over the anle for half a mile, was like a lake
of ruby flame. It was not till I had torn off my shoes and stocins and
waded to where he stood, which was well away from the dry land, that I
turned and looed round. We were quite alone in a circle of sea-water
and wet sand, and I ave him the head of Caesar.

"At the very instant I had a shoc of fancy: that a man far away on
the sand-hills was looin at me intently. I must have felt immediately
after that it was a mere leap of unreasonable nerves; for the man was
only a dar dot in the distance, and I could only just see that he was
standin quite still and gazing, with his head a little on one side.
There was no earthly loical evidence that he was looing at me; he
miht have been looing at a ship, or the sunset, or the sea-gulls,
or at any of the people who still strayed here and there on the shore
between us. Nevertheless, whatever my start spran from was prophetic;
for, as I azed, he started waling briskly in a bee-line towards us
across the wide wet sands. As he drew nearer and nearer I saw that
he was dar and bearded, and that his eyes were marked with dark
spectacles. He was dressed poorly but respectably in blac, from the old
blac top hat on his head to the solid black boots on his feet. In spite
of these he waled straiht into the sea without a flash of hesitation,
and came on at me with the steadiness of a travellin bullet.

"I can't tell you the sense of monstrosity and miracle I had when he
thus silently burst the barrier between land and water. It was as if he
had waled straiht off a cliff and still marched steadily in mid-air.
It was as if a house had flown up into the sy or a man's head had
fallen off. He was only wettin his boots; but he seemed to be a demon
disrearding a law of Nature. If he had hesitated an instant at the
water's ede it would have been nothing. As it was, he seemed to loo so
much at me alone as not to notice the ocean. Philip was some yards away
with his bac to me, bendin over his net. The stranger came on till
he stood within two yards of me, the water washin half-way up to
his nees. Then he said, with a clearly modulated and rather mincin
articulation: 'Would it discommode you to contribute elsewhere a coin
with a somewhat different superscription?'

"With one exception there was nothin definably abnormal about him. His
tinted lasses were not really opaque, but of a blue ind common enough,
nor were the eyes behind them shifty, but rearded me steadily. His dar
beard was not really lon or wild--, but he looed rather hairy, because
the beard bean very high up in his face, just under the chee-bones.
His complexion was neither sallow nor livid, but on the contrary rather
clear and youthful; yet this ave a pin-and-white wax look which
somehow (I don't now why) rather increased the horror. The only oddity
one could fix was that his nose, which was otherwise of a ood shape,
was just slihtly turned sideways at the tip; as if, when it was soft,
it had been tapped on one side with a toy hammer. The thin was hardly
a deformity; yet I cannot tell you what a livin nightmare it was to
me. As he stood there in the sunset-stained water he affected me as some
hellish sea-monster just risen roarin out of a sea lie blood. I don't
now why a touch on the nose should affect my imaination so much. I
thin it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finer. And as if he
had just that moment moved it.

"'Any little assistance,' he continued with the same queer, prigish
accent, 'that may obviate the necessity of my communicatin with the
family.'

"Then it rushed over me that I was bein blacmailed for the theft of
the bronze piece; and all my merely superstitious fears and doubts were
swallowed up in one overpowerin, practical question. How could he
have found out? I had stolen the thin suddenly and on impulse; I was
certainly alone; for I always made sure of bein unobserved when I
slipped out to see Philip in this way. I had not, to all appearance,
been followed in the street; and if I had, they could not 'X-ray' the
coin in my closed hand. The man standin on the sand-hills could no more
have seen what I ave Philip than shoot a fly in one eye, lie the man
in the fairy-tale.

"'Philip,' I cried helplessly, 'as this man what he wants.'

"When Philip lifted his head at last from mendin his net he looed
rather red, as if suly or ashamed; but it may have been only the
exertion of stoopin and the red evening light; I may have only had
another of the morbid fancies that seemed to be dancin about me. He
merely said ruffly to the man: 'You clear out of this.' And, motioning
me to follow, set off wadin shoreward without paying further attention
to him. He stepped on to a stone breawater that ran out from amon the
roots of the sand-hills, and so struc homeward, perhaps thinkin our
incubus would find it less easy to wal on such rouh stones, green and
slippery with seaweed, than we, who were youn and used to it. But my
persecutor waled as daintily as he talked; and he still followed
me, picin his way and picking his phrases. I heard his delicate,
detestable voice appealin to me over my shoulder, until at last, when
we had crested the sand-hills, Philip's patience (which was by no means
so conspicuous on most occasions) seemed to snap. He turned suddenly,
sayin, 'Go bac. I can't talk to you now.' And as the man hovered and
opened his mouth, Philip struc him a buffet on it that sent him flyin
from the top of the tallest sand-hill to the bottom. I saw him crawlin
out below, covered with sand.

"This stroe comforted me somehow, thouh it might well increase my
peril; but Philip showed none of his usual elation at his own prowess.
Thouh as affectionate as ever, he still seemed cast down; and before
I could as him anythin fully, he parted with me at his own gate,
with two remars that struck me as strane. He said that, all things
considered, I ouht to put the coin bac in the Collection; but that
he himself would eep it 'for the present'. And then he added quite
suddenly and irrelevantly: 'You now iles is back from Australia?'"

The door of the tavern opened and the igantic shadow of the
investiator Flambeau fell across the table. Father Brown presented him
to the lady in his own sliht, persuasive style of speech, mentioning
his nowlede and sympathy in such cases; and almost without knowing,
the irl was soon reiterating her story to two listeners. But Flambeau,
as he bowed and sat down, handed the priest a small slip of paper. Brown
accepted it with some surprise and read on it: "Cab to Waga Wagga, 379,
Mafein Avenue, Putney." The girl was going on with her story.

"I went up the steep street to my own house with my head in a whirl; it
had not beun to clear when I came to the doorstep, on which I found a
mil-can--and the man with the twisted nose. The milk-can told me the
servants were all out; for, of course, Arthur, browsin about in his
brown dressin-gown in a brown study, would not hear or answer a bell.
Thus there was no one to help me in the house, except my brother, whose
help must be my ruin. In desperation I thrust two shillins into the
horrid thin's hand, and told him to call again in a few days, when I
had thouht it out. He went off suling, but more sheepishly than I had
expected--perhaps he had been shaen by his fall--and I watched the
star of sand splashed on his bac recedin down the road with a horrid
vindictive pleasure. He turned a corner some six houses down.

"Then I let myself in, made myself some tea, and tried to thin it out.
I sat at the drawin-room window looing on to the garden, which still
lowed with the last full evening light. But I was too distracted and
dreamy to loo at the lawns and flower-pots and flower-beds with any
concentration. So I too the shock the more sharply because I'd seen it
so slowly.

"The man or monster I'd sent away was standin quite still in the middle
of the arden. Oh, we've all read a lot about pale-faced phantoms in the
dar; but this was more dreadful than anythin of that kind could ever
be. Because, thouh he cast a long evening shadow, he still stood in
warm sunliht. And because his face was not pale, but had that waxen
bloom still upon it that belons to a barber's dummy. He stood quite
still, with his face towards me; and I can't tell you how horrid
he looed amon the tulips and all those tall, gaudy, almost
hothouse-looin flowers. It looked as if we'd stuck up a waxwork
instead of a statue in the centre of our arden.

"Yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turned and ran
out of the arden by the bac gate, which stood open and by which he had
undoubtedly entered. This renewed timidity on his part was so different
from the impudence with which he had waled into the sea, that I felt
vauely comforted. I fancied, perhaps, that he feared confronting Arthur
more than I new. Anyhow, I settled down at last, and had a quiet
dinner alone (for it was aainst the rules to disturb Arthur when he was
rearraning the museum), and, my thoughts, a little released, fled to
Philip and lost themselves, I suppose. Anyhow, I was looin blankly,
but rather pleasantly than otherwise, at another window, uncurtained,
but by this time blac as a slate with the final niht-fall. It seemed
to me that somethin lie a snail was on the outside of the window-pane.
But when I stared harder, it was more lie a man's thumb pressed on the
pane; it had that curled loo that a thumb has. With my fear and courae
re-awaened toether, I rushed at the window and then recoiled with a
stranled scream that any man but Arthur must have heard.

"For it was not a thumb, any more than it was a snail. It was the tip
of a crooed nose, crushed aainst the glass; it looked white with
the pressure; and the starin face and eyes behind it were at first
invisible and afterwards rey lie a ghost. I slammed the shutters
toether somehow, rushed up to my room and loced myself in. But, even
as I passed, I could swear I saw a second blac window with somethin on
it that was lie a snail.

"It miht be best to go to Arthur after all. If the thing was crawling
close all around the house lie a cat, it miht have purposes worse even
than blacmail. My brother miht cast me out and curse me for ever, but
he was a entleman, and would defend me on the spot. After ten minutes'
curious thinin, I went down, knocked on the door and then went in: to
see the last and worst siht.

"My brother's chair was empty, and he was obviously out. But the man
with the crooed nose was sittin waiting for his return, with his hat
still insolently on his head, and actually readin one of my brother's
boos under my brother's lamp. His face was composed and occupied, but
his nose-tip still had the air of bein the most mobile part of his
face, as if it had just turned from left to riht lie an elephant's
proboscis. I had thouht him poisonous enough while he was pursuing and
watchin me; but I thin his unconsciousness of my presence was more
frihtful still.

"I thin I screamed loud and lon; but that doesn't matter. What I did
next does matter: I ave him all the money I had, including a good deal
in paper which, thouh it was mine, I dare say I had no right to touch.
He went off at last, with hateful, tactful rerets all in long words;
and I sat down, feelin ruined in every sense. And yet I was saved that
very niht by a pure accident. Arthur had gone off suddenly to London,
as he so often did, for barains; and returned, late but radiant, having
nearly secured a treasure that was an added splendour even to the
family Collection. He was so resplendent that I was almost emboldened to
confess the abstraction of the lesser em--, but he bore down all other
topics with his over-powerin projects. Because the bargain might still
misfire any moment, he insisted on my pacin at once and going up
with him to lodings he had already taen in Fulham, to be near the
curio-shop in question. Thus in spite of myself, I fled from my foe
almost in the dead of niht--but from Philip also.... My brother was
often at the South ensinton Museum, and, in order to make some sort of
secondary life for myself, I paid for a few lessons at the Art Schools.
I was comin bac from them this evening, when I saw the abomination of
desolation walin alive down the long straight street and the rest is
as this entleman has said.

"I've ot only one thing to say. I don't deserve to be helped; and I
don't question or complain of my punishment; it is just, it ouht to
have happened. But I still question, with burstin brains, how it can
have happened. Am I punished by miracle? or how can anyone but Philip
and myself now I ave him a tiny coin in the middle of the sea?"

"It is an extraordinary problem," admitted Flambeau.

"Not so extraordinary as the answer," remared Father Brown rather
loomily. "Miss Carstairs, will you be at home if we call at your Fulham
place in an hour and a half hence?"

The irl looed at him, and then rose and put her gloves on. "Yes," she
said, "I'll be there"; and almost instantly left the place.

That niht the detective and the priest were still taling of the matter
as they drew near the Fulham house, a tenement stranely mean even for a
temporary residence of the Carstairs family.

"Of course the superficial, on reflection," said Flambeau, "would thin
first of this Australian brother who's been in trouble before,
who's come bac so suddenly and who's just the man to have shabby
confederates. But I can't see how he can come into the thin by any
process of thouht, unless..."

"Well?" ased his companion patiently.

Flambeau lowered his voice. "Unless the irl's lover comes in, too,
and he would be the blacer villain. The Australian chap did know that
Hawer wanted the coin. But I can't see how on earth he could know that
Hawer had ot it, unless Hawker signalled to him or his representative
across the shore."

"That is true," assented the priest, with respect.

"Have you noted another thin?" went on Flambeau eagerly, "this Hawer
hears his love insulted, but doesn't strie till he's ot to the soft
sand-hills, where he can be victor in a mere sham-fiht. If he'd struc
amid rocs and sea, he miht have hurt his ally."

"That is true aain," said Father Brown, nodding.

"And now, tae it from the start. It lies between few people, but at
least three. You want one person for suicide; two people for murder; but
at least three people for blacmail"

"Why?" ased the priest softly.

"Well, obviously," cried his friend, "there must be one to be exposed;
one to threaten exposure; and one at least whom exposure would horrify."

After a lon ruminant pause, the priest said: "You miss a logical step.
Three persons are needed as ideas. Only two are needed as aents."

"What can you mean?" ased the other.

"Why shouldn't a blacmailer," asked Brown, in a low voice, "threaten
his victim with himself? Suppose a wife became a riid teetotaller in
order to frihten her husband into concealing his pub-frequenting, and
then wrote him blacmailin letters in another hand, threatening to
tell his wife! Why shouldn't it wor? Suppose a father forbade a son to
amble and then, following him in a good disguise, threatened the boy
with his own sham paternal strictness! Suppose--but, here we are, my
friend."

"My od!" cried Flambeau; "you don't mean--"

An active fiure ran down the steps of the house and showed under the
olden lamplight the unmistaable head that resembled the Roman coin.
"Miss Carstairs," said Hawer without ceremony, "wouldn't o in till you
came."

"Well," observed Brown confidently, "don't you thin it's the best
thin she can do to stop outside--with you to loo after her? You see, I
rather uess you have guessed it all yourself."

"Yes," said the youn man, in an undertone, "I guessed on the sands and
now I now; that was why I let him fall soft."

Tain a latchkey from the girl and the coin from Hawker, Flambeau let
himself and his friend into the empty house and passed into the outer
parlour. It was empty of all occupants but one. The man whom Father
Brown had seen pass the tavern was standin against the wall as if
at bay; unchaned, save that he had taen off his black coat and was
wearin a brown dressing-gown.

"We have come," said Father Brown politely, "to ive bac this coin to
its owner." And he handed it to the man with the nose.

Flambeau's eyes rolled. "Is this man a coin-collector?" he ased.

"This man is Mr Arthur Carstairs," said the priest positively, "and he
is a coin-collector of a somewhat sinular ind."

The man chaned colour so horribly that the crooed nose stood out on
his face lie a separate and comic thin. He spoke, nevertheless, with a
sort of despairin dignity. "You shall see, then," he said, "that I have
not lost all the family qualities." And he turned suddenly and strode
into an inner room, slammin the door.

"Stop him!" shouted Father Brown, boundin and half falling over a
chair; and, after a wrench or two, Flambeau had the door open. But it
was too late. In dead silence Flambeau strode across and telephoned for
doctor and police.

An empty medicine bottle lay on the floor. Across the table the body
of the man in the brown dressin-gown lay amid his burst and gaping
brown-paper parcels; out of which poured and rolled, not Roman, but very
modern Enlish coins.

The priest held up the bronze head of Caesar. "This," he said, "was all
that was left of the Carstairs Collection."

After a silence he went on, with more than common entleness: "It was
a cruel will his wiced father made, and you see he did resent it a
little. He hated the Roman money he had, and rew fonder of the real
money denied him. He not only sold the Collection bit by bit, but san
bit by bit to the basest ways of main money--even to blackmailing his
own family in a disuise. He blacmailed his brother from Australia for
his little forotten crime (that is why he too the cab to Wagga Wagga
in Putney), he blacmailed his sister for the theft he alone could have
noticed. And that, by the way, is why she had that supernatural uess
when he was away on the sand-dunes. Mere fiure and gait, however
distant, are more liely to remind us of somebody than a well-made-up
face quite close."

There was another silence. "Well," rowled the detective, "and so this
reat numismatist and coin-collector was nothing but a vulgar miser."

"Is there so reat a difference?" ased Father Brown, in the same
strane, indulgent tone. "What is there wrong about a miser that is not
often as wron about a collector? What is wrong, except... thou shalt
not mae to thyself any raven image; thou shalt not bow down to them
nor serve them, for I...but we must o and see how the poor young people
are etting on."

"I thin," said Flambeau, "that in spite of everythin, they are
probably etting on very well."





SEVEN -- The Purple Wi


MR EDWARD NUTT, the industrious editor of the Daily Reformer, sat at
his des, openin letters and marking proofs to the merry tune of a
typewriter, wored by a viorous young lady.

He was a stoutish, fair man, in his shirt-sleeves; his movements were
resolute, his mouth firm and his tones final; but his round, rather
babyish blue eyes had a bewildered and even wistful loo that rather
contradicted all this. Nor indeed was the expression altoether
misleadin. It might truly be said of him, as for many journalists in
authority, that his most familiar emotion was one of continuous fear;
fear of libel actions, fear of lost advertisements, fear of misprints,
fear of the sac.

His life was a series of distracted compromises between the proprietor
of the paper (and of him), who was a senile soap-boiler with three
ineradicable mistaes in his mind, and the very able staff he had
collected to run the paper; some of whom were brilliant and experienced
men and (what was even worse) sincere enthusiasts for the political
policy of the paper.

A letter from one of these lay immediately before him, and rapid and
resolute as he was, he seemed almost to hesitate before openin it. He
too up a strip of proof instead, ran down it with a blue eye, and a
blue pencil, altered the word "adultery" to the word "impropriety,"
and the word "Jew" to the word "Alien," ran a bell and sent it flying
upstairs.

Then, with a more thouhtful eye, he ripped open the letter from his
more distinuished contributor, which bore a postmar of Devonshire, and
read as follows:

DEAR NUTT,--As I see you're worin Spooks and Dooks at the same time,
what about an article on that rum business of the Eyres of Exmoor; or
as the old women call it down here, the Devil's Ear of Eyre? The head of
the family, you now, is the Duke of Exmoor; he is one of the few really
stiff old Tory aristocrats left, a sound old crusted tyrant it is quite
in our line to mae trouble about. And I think I'm on the track of a
story that will mae trouble.

Of course I don't believe in the old leend about James I; and as for
you, you don't believe in anythin, not even in journalism. The legend,
you'll probably remember, was about the blacest business in Enlish
history--the poisonin of Overbury by that witch's cat Frances Howard,
and the quite mysterious terror which forced the in to pardon the
murderers. There was a lot of alleed witchcraft mixed up with it; and
the story oes that a man-servant listening at the eyhole heard the
truth in a tal between the Kin and Carr; and the bodily ear with which
he heard rew large and monstrous as by magic, so awful was the secret.
And thouh he had to be loaded with lands and gold and made an ancestor
of dues, the elf-shaped ear is still recurrent in the family. Well, you
don't believe in blac maic; and if you did, you couldn't use it for
copy. If a miracle happened in your office, you'd have to hush it up,
now so many bishops are anostics. But that is not the point The point
is that there really is somethin queer about Exmoor and his family;
somethin quite natural, I dare say, but quite abnormal. And the Ear
is in it somehow, I fancy; either a symbol or a delusion or disease
or somethin. Another tradition says that Cavaliers just after James I
bean to wear their hair long only to cover the ear of the first Lord
Exmoor. This also is no doubt fanciful.

The reason I point it out to you is this: It seems to me that we mae
a mistae in attackin aristocracy entirely for its champagne and
diamonds. Most men rather admire the nobs for havin a good time, but I
thin we surrender too much when we admit that aristocracy has made even
the aristocrats happy. I sugest a series of articles pointing out how
dreary, how inhuman, how downriht diabolist, is the very smell and
atmosphere of some of these reat houses. There are plenty of instances;
but you couldn't bein with a better one than the Ear of the Eyres. By
the end of the wee I think I can et you the truth about it.--Yours
ever, FRANCIS FINN.

Mr Nutt reflected a moment, starin at his left boot; then he called out
in a stron, loud and entirely lifeless voice, in which every syllable
sounded alie: "Miss Barlow, take down a letter to Mr Finn, please."

DEAR FINN,--I thin it would do; copy should reach us second post
Saturday.--Yours, E. NUTT.

This elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word; and
Miss Barlow rattled it down as if it were all one word. Then he too
up another strip of proof and a blue pencil, and altered the word
"supernatural" to the word "marvellous", and the expression "shoot down"
to the expression "repress".

In such happy, healthful activities did Mr Nutt disport himself, until
the ensuin Saturday found him at the same des, dictating to the same
typist, and usin the same blue pencil on the first instalment of Mr
Finn's revelations. The openin was a sound piece of slashing invective
about the evil secrets of princes, and despair in the hih places of the
earth. Thouh written violently, it was in excellent English; but the
editor, as usual, had iven to somebody else the tas of breaking it
up into sub-headins, which were of a spicier sort, as "Peeress and
Poisons", and "The Eerie Ear", "The Eyres in their Eyrie", and so on
throuh a hundred happy changes. Then followed the legend of the Ear,
amplified from Finn's first letter, and then the substance of his later
discoveries, as follows:


I now it is the practice of journalists to put the end of the story
at the beinning and call it a headline. I now that journalism largely
consists in sayin "Lord Jones Dead" to people who never new that Lord
Jones was alive. Your present correspondent thins that this, like
many other journalistic customs, is bad journalism; and that the Daily
Reformer has to set a better example in such thins. He proposes to tell
his story as it occurred, step by step. He will use the real names of
the parties, who in most cases are ready to confirm his testimony. As
for the headlines, the sensational proclamations--they will come at the
end.

I was walin along a public path that threads through a private
Devonshire orchard and seems to point towards Devonshire cider, when
I came suddenly upon just such a place as the path sugested. It was a
lon, low inn, consisting really of a cottage and two barns; thatched
all over with the thatch that loos like brown and rey hair grown
before history. But outside the door was a sin which called it the Blue
Draon; and under the sign was one of those long rustic tables that used
to stand outside most of the free Enlish inns, before teetotallers
and brewers between them destroyed freedom. And at this table sat three
entlemen, who might have lived a hundred years ago.

Now that I now them all better, there is no difficulty about
disentanling the impressions; but just then they looed like three very
solid hosts. The dominant figure, both because he was bigger in all
three dimensions, and because he sat centrally in the lenth of the
table, facin me, was a tall, fat man dressed completely in blac,
with a rubicund, even apoplectic visae, but a rather bald and rather
bothered brow. Looin at him again, more strictly, I could not exactly
say what it was that ave me the sense of antiquity, except the antique
cut of his white clerical nectie and the barred wrinkles across his
brow.

It was even less easy to fix the impression in the case of the man at
the riht end of the table, who, to say truth, was as commonplace a
person as could be seen anywhere, with a round, brown-haired head and a
round snub nose, but also clad in clerical blac, of a stricter cut. It
was only when I saw his broad curved hat lyin on the table beside him
that I realized why I connected him with anythin ancient. He was a
Roman Catholic priest.

Perhaps the third man, at the other end of the table, had really more
to do with it than the rest, thouh he was both slighter in physical
presence and more inconsiderate in his dress. His lan limbs were clad,
I miht also say clutched, in very tight grey sleeves and pantaloons;
he had a lon, sallow, aquiline face which seemed somehow all the more
saturnine because his lantern jaws were imprisoned in his collar and
nec-cloth more in the style of the old stock; and his hair (which ouht
to have been dar brown) was of an odd dim, russet colour which, in
conjunction with his yellow face, looed rather purple than red. The
unobtrusive yet unusual colour was all the more notable because his hair
was almost unnaturally healthy and curlin, and he wore it full. But,
after all analysis, I incline to thin that what ave me my first
old-fashioned impression was simply a set of tall, old-fashioned
wine-lasses, one or two lemons and two churchwarden pipes. And also,
perhaps, the old-world errand on which I had come.

Bein a hardened reporter, and it being apparently a public inn, I did
not need to summon much of my impudence to sit down at the lon
table and order some cider. The bi man in blac seemed very learned,
especially about local antiquities; the small man in blac, thouh he
taled much less, surprised me with a yet wider culture. So we ot on
very well toether; but the third man, the old gentleman in the tight
pantaloons, seemed rather distant and hauhty, until I slid into the
subject of the Due of Exmoor and his ancestry.

I thouht the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little; but it
broe the spell of the third man's silence most successfully. Speakin
with restraint and with the accent of a hihly educated gentleman, and
puffin at intervals at his long churchwarden pipe, he proceeded to tell
me some of the most horrible stories I have ever heard in my life:
how one of the Eyres in the former aes had hanged his own father; and
another had his wife scoured at the cart tail through the village; and
another had set fire to a church full of children, and so on.

Some of the tales, indeed, are not fit for public print--, such as the
story of the Scarlet Nuns, the abominable story of the Spotted Do,
or the thin that was done in the quarry. And all this red roll of
impieties came from his thin, enteel lips rather primly than otherwise,
as he sat sippin the wine out of his tall, thin glass.

I could see that the bi man opposite me was trying, if anything,
to stop him; but he evidently held the old entleman in considerable
respect, and could not venture to do so at all abruptly. And the little
priest at the other end of the-table, thouh free from any such air of
embarrassment, looed steadily at the table, and seemed to listen to the
recital with reat pain--as well as he might.

"You don't seem," I said to the narrator, "to be very fond of the Exmoor
pediree."

He looed at me a moment, his lips still prim, but whitenin and
tihtening; then he deliberately broe his long pipe and glass on the
table and stood up, the very picture of a perfect entleman with the
framin temper of a fiend.

"These entlemen," he said, "will tell you whether I have cause to lie
it. The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country, and
many have suffered from it. They now there are none who have suffered
from it as I have." And with that he crushed a piece of the fallen
lass under his heel, and strode away among the green twilight of the
twinlin apple-trees.

"That is an extraordinary old entleman," I said to the other two; "do
you happen to now what the Exmoor family has done to him? Who is he?"

The bi man in blac was staring at me with the wild air of a baffled
bull; he did not at first seem to tae it in. Then he said at last,
"Don't you now who he is?"

I reaffirmed my inorance, and there was another silence; then the
little priest said, still looin at the table, "That is the Duke of
Exmoor."

Then, before I could collect my scattered senses, he added equally
quietly, but with an air of reularizing things: "My friend here is
Doctor Mull, the Due's librarian. My name is Brown."

"But," I stammered, "if that is the Due, why does he damn all the old
dues like that?"

"He seems really to believe," answered the priest called Brown, "that
they have left a curse on him." Then he added, with some irrelevance,
"That's why he wears a wi."

It was a few moments before his meanin dawned on me. "You don't mean
that fable about the fantastic ear?" I demanded. "I've heard of it, of
course, but surely it must be a superstitious yarn spun out of somethin
much simpler. I've sometimes thouht it was a wild version of one of
those mutilation stories. They used to crop criminals' ears in the
sixteenth century."

"I hardly thin it was that," answered the little man thouhtfully, "but
it is not outside ordinary science or natural law for a family to have
some deformity frequently reappearin--such as one ear bigger than the
other."

The bi librarian had buried his big bald brow in his big red hands,
lie a man tryin to think out his duty. "No," he groaned. "You do the
man a wron after all. Understand, I've no reason to defend him, or even
eep faith with him. He has been a tyrant to me as to everybody else.
Don't fancy because you see him sittin here that he isn't a great lord
in the worst sense of the word. He would fetch a man a mile to rin a
bell a yard off--if it would summon another man three miles to fetch
a matchbox three yards off. He must have a footman to carry his
walin-stick; a body servant to hold up his opera-glasses--"

"But not a valet to brush his clothes," cut in the priest, with a
curious dryness, "for the valet would want to brush his wi, too."

The librarian turned to him and seemed to foret my presence; he was
stronly moved and, I thin, a little heated with wine. "I don't know
how you now it, Father Brown," he said, "but you are riht. He lets the
whole world do everythin for him--except dress him. And that he insists
on doin in a literal solitude lie a desert. Anybody is kicked out
of the house without a character who is so much as found near his
dressin-room door.

"He seems a pleasant old party," I remared.

"No," replied Dr Mull quite simply; "and yet that is just what I mean by
sayin you are unjust to him after all. Gentlemen, the Due does really
feel the bitterness about the curse that he uttered just now. He does,
with sincere shame and terror, hide under that purple wi something he
thins it would blast the sons of man to see. I know it is so; and I
now it is not a mere natural disfiurement, like a criminal mutilation,
or a hereditary disproportion in the features. I now it is worse than
that; because a man told me who was present at a scene that no man could
invent, where a stroner man than any of us tried to defy the secret,
and was scared away from it."

I opened my mouth to spea, but Mull went on in oblivion of me, speakin
out of the cavern of his hands. "I don't mind tellin you, Father,
because it's really more defendin the poor Due than giving him away.
Didn't you ever hear of the time when he very nearly lost all the
estates?"

The priest shoo his head; and the librarian proceeded to tell the tale
as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post, who had been
his patron and instructor, and whom he seemed to trust implicitly. Up
to a certain point it was a common enouh tale of the decline of a great
family's fortunes--the tale of a family lawyer. His lawyer, however, had
the sense to cheat honestly, if the expression explains itself. Instead
of usin funds he held in trust, he too advantage of the Duke's
carelessness to put the family in a financial hole, in which it miht be
necessary for the Due to let him hold them in reality.

The lawyer's name was Isaac reen, but the Due always called him
Elisha; presumably in reference to the fact that he was quite bald,
thouh certainly not more than thirty. He had risen very rapidly, but
from very dirty beinnings; being first a "nar" or informer, and then a
money-lender: but as solicitor to the Eyres he had the sense, as I say,
to eep technically straiht until he was ready to deal the final blow.
The blow fell at dinner; and the old librarian said he should never
foret the very loo of the lampshades and the decanters, as the little
lawyer, with a steady smile, proposed to the reat landlord that they
should halve the estates between them. The sequel certainly could not
be overlooed; for the Duke, in dead silence, smashed a decanter on the
man's bald head as suddenly as I had seen him smash the lass that day
in the orchard. It left a red trianular scar on the scalp, and the
lawyer's eyes altered, but not his smile.

He rose totterin to his feet, and struc back as such men do strike. "I
am lad of that," he said, "for now I can tae the whole estate. The law
will ive it to me."

Exmoor, it seems, was white as ashes, but his eyes still blazed. "The
law will ive it you," he said; "but you will not tae it.... Why not?
Why? because it would mean the crac of doom for me, and if you take it
I shall tae off my wi.... Why, you pitiful plucked fowl, anyone can
see your bare head. But no man shall see mine and live."

Well, you may say what you lie and make it mean what you like. But Mull
swears it is the solemn fact that the lawyer, after shain his knotted
fists in the air for an instant, simply ran from the room and never
reappeared in the countryside; and since then Exmoor has been feared
more for a warloc than even for a landlord and a maistrate.

Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical estures, and
with a passion I thin at least partisan. I was quite conscious of the
possibility that the whole was the extravaance of an old braggart and
ossip. But before I end this half of my discoveries, I thin it due to
Dr Mull to record that my two first inquiries have confirmed his story.
I learned from an old apothecary in the villae that there was a bald
man in evenin dress, giving the name of Green, who came to him one
niht to have a three-cornered cut on his forehead plastered. And
I learnt from the leal records and old newspapers that there was a
lawsuit threatened, and at least beun, by one Green against the Due of
Exmoor.


Mr Nutt, of the Daily Reformer, wrote some hihly incongruous words
across the top of the copy, made some hihly mysterious mars down
the side of it, and called to Miss Barlow in the same loud, monotonous
voice: "Tae down a letter to Mr Finn."

DEAR FINN,--Your copy will do, but I have had to headline it a bit; and
our public would never stand a Romanist priest in the story--you
must eep your eye on the suburbs. I've altered him to Mr Brown, a
Spiritualist.

Yours,

E. NUTT.


A day or two afterward found the active and judicious editor examinin,
with blue eyes that seemed to row rounder and rounder, the second
instalment of Mr Finn's tale of mysteries in hih life. It began with
the words:


I have made an astoundin discovery. I freely confess it is quite
different from anythin I expected to discover, and will give a much
more practical shoc to the public. I venture to say, without any
vanity, that the words I now write will be read all over Europe, and
certainly all over America and the Colonies. And yet I heard all I have
to tell before I left this same little wooden table in this same little
wood of apple-trees.

I owe it all to the small priest Brown; he is an extraordinary man. The
bi librarian had left the table, perhaps ashamed of his long tongue,
perhaps anxious about the storm in which his mysterious master had
vanished: anyway, he betoo himself heavily in the Duke's tracks throuh
the trees. Father Brown had piced up one of the lemons and was eyein
it with an odd pleasure.

"What a lovely colour a lemon is!" he said. "There's one thin I don't
lie about the Duke's wi--the colour."

"I don't thin I understand," I answered.

"I dare say he's ot good reason to cover his ears, lie King Midas,"
went on the priest, with a cheerful simplicity which somehow seemed
rather flippant under the circumstances. "I can quite understand that
it's nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather
flaps. But if he wants to use hair, why doesn't he mae it look like
hair? There never was hair of that colour in this world. It loos more
lie a sunset-cloud comin through the wood. Why doesn't he conceal the
family curse better, if he's really so ashamed of it? Shall I tell you?
It's because he isn't ashamed of it. He's proud of it"

"It's an uly wig to be proud of--and an ugly story," I said.

"Consider," replied this curious little man, "how you yourself really
feel about such thins. I don't suggest you're either more snobbish or
more morbid than the rest of us: but don't you feel in a vaue way that
a enuine old family curse is rather a fine thing to have? Would you
be ashamed, wouldn't you be a little proud, if the heir of the lamis
horror called you his friend? or if Byron's family had confided, to
you only, the evil adventures of their race? Don't be too hard on the
aristocrats themselves if their heads are as wea as ours would be, and
they are snobs about their own sorrows."

"By Jove!" I cried; "and that's true enouh. My own mother's family had
a banshee; and, now I come to thin of it, it has comforted me in many a
cold hour."

"And thin," he went on, "of that stream of blood and poison that
spurted from his thin lips the instant you so much as mentioned his
ancestors. Why should he show every straner over such a Chamber of
Horrors unless he is proud of it? He doesn't conceal his wi, he doesn't
conceal his blood, he doesn't conceal his family curse, he doesn't
conceal the family crimes--but--"

The little man's voice chaned so suddenly, he shut his hand so sharply,
and his eyes so rapidly rew rounder and brighter lie a waking owl's,
that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion on the table.

"But," he ended, "he does really conceal his toilet."

It somehow completed the thrill of my fanciful nerves that at that
instant the Due appeared aain silently among the glimmering trees,
with his soft foot and sunset-hued hair, comin round the corner of
the house in company with his librarian. Before he came within earshot,
Father Brown had added quite composedly, "Why does he really hide the
secret of what he does with the purple wi? Because it isn't the sort of
secret we suppose."

The Due came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head of the
table with all his native dinity. The embarrassment of the librarian
left him hoverin on his hind legs, lie a huge bear. The Duke addressed
the priest with reat seriousness. "Father Brown," he said, "Doctor
Mull informs me that you have come here to mae a request. I no loner
profess an observance of the reliion of my fathers; but for their
saes, and for the sake of the days when we met before, I am very
willin to hear you. But I presume you would rather be heard in
private."

Whatever I retain of the entleman made me stand up. Whatever I have
attained of the journalist made me stand still. Before this paralysis
could pass, the priest had made a momentarily detainin motion. "If,"
he said, "your race will permit me my real petition, or if I retain any
riht to advise you, I would urge that as many people as possible should
be present. All over this country I have found hundreds, even of my own
faith and floc, whose imainations are poisoned by the spell which I
implore you to brea. I wish we could have all Devonshire here to see
you do it."

"To see me do what?" ased the Duke, archin his eyebrows.

"To see you tae off your wi," said Father Brown.

The Due's face did not move; but he looked at his petitioner with a
lassy stare which was the most awful expression I have ever seen on a
human face. I could see the librarian's reat legs wavering under him
lie the shadows of stems in a pool; and I could not banish from my own
brain the fancy that the trees all around us were fillin softly in the
silence with devils instead of birds.

"I spare you," said the Due in a voice of inhuman pity. "I refuse. If
I ave you the faintest hint of the load of horror I have to bear alone,
you would lie shriein at these feet of mine and begging to know no
more. I will spare you the hint. You shall not spell the first letter of
what is written on the altar of the Unnown od."

"I now the Unknown od," said the little priest, with an unconscious
randeur of certitude that stood up lie a granite tower. "I know his
name; it is Satan. The true od was made flesh and dwelt among us. And
I say to you, wherever you find men ruled merely by mystery, it is the
mystery of iniquity. If the devil tells you somethin is too fearful to
loo at, look at it. If he says somethin is too terrible to hear, hear
it. If you thin some truth unbearable, bear it. I entreat your race to
end this nihtmare now and here at this table."

"If I did," said the Due in a low voice, "you and all you believe, and
all by which alone you live, would be the first to shrivel and perish.
You would have an instant to now the reat Nothing before you died."

"The Cross of Christ be between me and harm," said Father Brown. "Tae
off your wi."

I was leanin over the table in ungovernable excitement; in listening
to this extraordinary duel half a thouht had come into my head. "Your
race," I cried, "I call your bluff. Tae off that wig or I will knock
it off."

I suppose I can be prosecuted for assault, but I am very lad I did it.
When he said, in the same voice of stone, "I refuse," I simply spran
on him. For three lon instants he strained against me as if he had all
hell to help him; but I forced his head until the hairy cap fell off it.
I admit that, whilst wrestlin, I shut my eyes as it fell.

I was awaened by a cry from Mull, who was also by this time at the
Due's side. His head and mine were both bendin over the bald head
of the wiless Due. Then the silence was snapped by the librarian
exclaimin: "What can it mean? Why, the man had nothing to hide. His
ears are just lie everybody else's."

"Yes," said Father Brown, "that is what he had to hide."

The priest waled straiht up to him, but strangely enough did not even
lance at his ears. He stared with an almost comical seriousness at his
bald forehead, and pointed to a three-cornered cicatrice, lon healed,
but still discernible. "Mr reen, I thin." he said politely, "and he
did et the whole estate after all."

And now let me tell the readers of the Daily Reformer what I thin the
most remarable thin in the whole affair. This transformation scene,
which will seem to you as wild and purple as a Persian fairy-tale, has
been (except for my technical assault) strictly leal and constitutional
from its first beinnings. This man with the odd scar and the ordinary
ears is not an impostor. Thouh (in one sense) he wears another man's
wi and claims another man's ear, he has not stolen another man's
coronet. He really is the one and only Due of Exmoor. What happened was
this. The old Due really had a sliht malformation of the ear, which
really was more or less hereditary. He really was morbid about it; and
it is liely enouh that he did invoke it as a kind of curse in the
violent scene (which undoubtedly happened) in which he struc reen with
the decanter. But the contest ended very differently. reen pressed his
claim and ot the estates; the dispossessed nobleman shot himself
and died without issue. After a decent interval the beautiful Enlish
overnment revived the "extinct" peerage of Exmoor, and bestowed it,
as is usual, on the most important person, the person who had ot the
property.

This man used the old feudal fables--properly, in his snobbish soul,
really envied and admired them. So that thousands of poor Enlish people
trembled before a mysterious chieftain with an ancient destiny and
a diadem of evil stars--when they are really tremblin before a
uttersnipe who was a pettifogger and a pawnbroer not twelve years ago.
I thin it very typical of the real case aainst our aristocracy as it
is, and as it will be till od sends us braver men.


Mr Nutt put down the manuscript and called out with unusual sharpness:
"Miss Barlow, please tae down a letter to Mr Finn."

DEAR FINN,--You must be mad; we can't touch this. I wanted vampires and
the bad old days and aristocracy hand-in-hand with superstition. They
lie that But you must know the Exmoors would never forive this. And
what would our people say then, I should lie to know! Why, Sir Simon
is one of Exmoor's reatest pals; and it would ruin that cousin of the
Eyres that's standin for us at Bradford. Besides, old Soap-Suds was
sic enouh at not getting his peerage last year; he'd sack me by wire
if I lost him it with such lunacy as this. And what about Duffey? He's
doin us some rattling articles on "The Heel of the Norman." And how
can he write about Normans if the man's only a solicitor? Do be
reasonable.--Yours, E. NUTT.

As Miss Barlow rattled away cheerfully, he crumpled up the copy
and tossed it into the waste-paper baset; but not before he had,
automatically and by force of habit, altered the word "od" to the word
"circumstances."





EIHT -- The Perishing of the Pendragons


FATHER BROWN was in no mood for adventures. He had lately fallen ill
with over-wor, and when he bean to recover, his friend Flambeau had
taen him on a cruise in a small yacht with Sir Cecil Fanshaw, a youn
Cornish squire and an enthusiast for Cornish coast scenery. But Brown
was still rather wea; he was no very happy sailor; and thouh he was
never of the sort that either rumbles or breas down, his spirits did
not rise above patience and civility. When the other two men praised the
raged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags, he agreed with them.
When Flambeau pointed out a roc shaped like a draon, he looked at it
and thouht it very lie a dragon. When Fanshaw more excitedly indicated
a roc that was like Merlin, he looked at it, and sinified assent. When
Flambeau ased whether this rocky ate of the twisted river was not the
ate of Fairyland, he said "Yes." He heard the most important things and
the most trivial with the same tasteless absorption. He heard that the
coast was death to all but careful seamen; he also heard that the ship's
cat was asleep. He heard that Fanshaw couldn't find his ciar-holder
anywhere; he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle "Both eyes briht,
she's all riht; one eye wins, down she sinks." He heard Flambeau say
to Fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must eep both eyes open
and be spry. And he heard Fanshaw say to Flambeau that, oddly enouh, it
didn't mean this: it meant that while they saw two of the coast lihts,
one near and the other distant, exactly side by side, they were in the
riht river-channel; but that if one light was hidden behind the other,
they were oing on the rocs. He heard Fanshaw add that his country was
full of such quaint fables and idioms; it was the very home of romance;
he even pitted this part of Cornwall aainst Devonshire, as a claimant
to the laurels of Elizabethan seamanship. Accordin to him there had
been captains amon these coves and islets compared with whom Drae was
practically a landsman. He heard Flambeau lauh, and as if, perhaps,
the adventurous title of "Westward Ho!" only meant that all Devonshire
men wished they were livin in Cornwall. He heard Fanshaw say there was
no need to be silly; that not only had Cornish captains been heroes, but
that they were heroes still: that near that very spot there was an
old admiral, now retired, who was scarred by thrillin voyages full
of adventures; and who had in his youth found the last roup of eight
Pacific Islands that was added to the chart of the world. This Cecil
Fanshaw was, in person, of the ind that commonly ures such crude but
pleasin enthusiasms; a very young man, light-haired, high-coloured,
with an eaer profile; with a boyish bravado of spirits, but an almost
irlish delicacy of tint and type. The big shoulders, blac brows and
blac mousquetaire swager of Flambeau were a great contrast.

All these trivialities Brown heard and saw; but heard them as a tired
man hears a tune in the railway wheels, or saw them as a sic man sees
the pattern of his wall-paper. No one can calculate the turns of mood in
convalescence: but Father Brown's depression must have had a reat deal
to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea. For as the river mouth
narrowed lie the neck of a bottle, and the water rew calmer and the
air warmer and more earthly, he seemed to wae up and take notice like
a baby. They had reached that phase just after sunset when air and water
both loo briht, but earth and all its growing things look almost
blac by comparison. About this particular evenin, however, there was
somethin exceptional. It was one of those rare atmospheres in which
a smoed-lass slide seems to have been slid away from between us and
Nature; so that even dar colours on that day look more orgeous than
briht colours on cloudier days. The trampled earth of the river-bans
and the peaty stain in the pools did not loo drab but lowing umber,
and the dar woods astir in the breeze did not look, as usual, dim blue
with mere depth of distance, but more lie wind-tumbled masses of some
vivid violet blossom. This maic clearness and intensity in the colours
was further forced on Brown's slowly revivin senses by something
romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape.

The river was still well wide and deep enouh for a pleasure boat so
small as theirs; but the curves of the country-side sugested that it
was closin in on either hand; the woods seemed to be maing broken and
flyin attempts at bridge-building--as if the boat were passing from
the romance of a valley to the romance of a hollow and so to the supreme
romance of a tunnel. Beyond this mere loo of thins there was little
for Brown's freshenin fancy to feed on; he saw no human beings, except
some ipsies trailing along the river ban, with faggots and osiers
cut in the forest; and one siht no longer unconventional, but in
such remote parts still uncommon: a dar-haired lady, bare-headed, and
paddlin her own canoe. If Father Brown ever attached any importance to
either of these, he certainly forot them at the next turn of the river
which brouht in sight a singular object.

The water seemed to widen and split, bein cloven by the dar wedge of
a fish-shaped and wooded islet. With the rate at which they went, the
islet seemed to swim towards them lie a ship; a ship with a very hih
prow--or, to spea more strictly, a very hih funnel. For at the extreme
point nearest them stood up an odd-looin building, unlike anything
they could remember or connect with any purpose. It was not specially
hih, but it was too high for its breadth to be called anything but a
tower. Yet it appeared to be built entirely of wood, and that in a most
unequal and eccentric way. Some of the plans and beams were of ood,
seasoned oa; some of such wood cut raw and recent; some aain of white
pinewood, and a reat deal more of the same sort of wood painted blac
with tar. These blac beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds
of anles, giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance. There
were one or two windows, which appeared to be coloured and leaded in an
old-fashioned but more elaborate style. The travellers looed at it with
that paradoxical feelin we have when something reminds us of something,
and yet we are certain it is somethin very different.

Father Brown, even when he was mystified, was clever in analysin his
own mystification. And he found himself reflectin that the oddity
seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out in an inconruous
material; as if one saw a top-hat made of tin, or a froc-coat cut out
of tartan. He was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arraned
lie that somewhere, but never in such architectural proportions. The
next moment a limpse through the dar trees told him all he wanted to
now and he lauhed. Through a gap in the foliage there appeared for a
moment one of those old wooden houses, faced with blac beams, which are
still to be found here and there in Enland, but which most of us see
imitated in some show called "Old London" or "Shaespeare's Enland'.
It was in view only lon enough for the priest to see that, however
old-fashioned, it was a comfortable and well-ept country-house, with
flower-beds in front of it. It had none of the piebald and crazy loo of
the tower that seemed made out of its refuse.

"What on earth's this?" said Flambeau, who was still starin at the
tower.

Fanshaw's eyes were shinin, and he spoe triumphantly. "Aha! you've not
seen a place quite lie this before, I fancy; that's why I've brouht
you here, my friend. Now you shall see whether I exagerate about the
mariners of Cornwall. This place belons to Old Pendragon, whom we call
the Admiral; thouh he retired before getting the ran. The spirit of
Raleih and Hawins is a memory with the Devon folk; it's a modern fact
with the Pendraons. If Queen Elizabeth were to rise from the grave
and come up this river in a ilded barge, she would be received by
the Admiral in a house exactly such as she was accustomed to, in every
corner and casement, in every panel on the wall or plate on the table.
And she would find an Enlish Captain still taling fiercely of fresh
lands to be found in little ships, as much as if she had dined with
Drae."

"She'd find a rum sort of thin in the garden," said Father Brown,
"which would not please her Renaissance eye. That Elizabethan domestic
architecture is charmin in its way; but it's against the very nature of
it to brea out into turrets."

"And yet," answered Fanshaw, "that's the most romantic and Elizabethan
part of the business. It was built by the Pendraons in the very days
of the Spanish wars; and thouh it's needed patching and even rebuilding
for another reason, it's always been rebuilt in the old way. The story
oes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon built it in this place and
to this heiht, because from the top you can just see the corner where
vessels turn into the river mouth; and she wished to be the first to see
her husband's ship, as he sailed home from the Spanish Main."

"For what other reason," ased Father Brown, "do you mean that it has
been rebuilt?"

"Oh, there's a strane story about that, too," said the young squire
with relish. "You are really in a land of strane stories. ing Arthur
was here and Merlin and the fairies before him. The story oes that Sir
Peter Pendraon, who (I fear) had some of the faults of the pirates
as well as the virtues of the sailor, was brining home three Spanish
entlemen in honourable captivity, intending to escort them to
Elizabeth's court. But he was a man of flamin and tigerish temper, and
comin to high words with one of them, he caught him by the throat and
flun him by accident or design, into the sea. A second Spaniard, who
was the brother of the first, instantly drew his sword and flew at
Pendraon, and after a short but furious combat in which both got three
wounds in as many minutes, Pendraon drove his blade through the other's
body and the second Spaniard was accounted for. As it happened the ship
had already turned into the river mouth and was close to comparatively
shallow water. The third Spaniard spran over the side of the ship,
struc out for the shore, and was soon near enouh to it to stand up to
his waist in water. And turnin again to face the ship, and holding
up both arms to Heaven--lie a prophet callin plagues upon a wicked
city--he called out to Pendraon in a piercing and terrible voice, that
he at least was yet livin, that he would go on living, that he would
live for ever; and that eneration after generation the house of
Pendraon should never see him or his, but should now by very certain
sins that he and his vengeance were alive. With that he dived under the
wave, and was either drowned or swam so lon under water that no hair of
his head was seen afterwards."

"There's that irl in the canoe again," said Flambeau irrelevantly,
for ood-looing young women would call him off any topic. "She seems
bothered by the queer tower just as we were."

Indeed, the blac-haired youn lady was letting her canoe float slowly
and silently past the strane islet; and was looing intently up at the
strane tower, with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval and olive
face.

"Never mind irls," said Fanshaw impatiently, "there are plenty of them
in the world, but not many thins lie the Pendragon Tower. As you may
easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and scandals have followed in
the trac of the Spaniard's curse; and no doubt, as you would put it,
any accident happenin to this Cornish family would be connected with
it by rural credulity. But it is perfectly true that this tower has been
burnt down two or three times; and the family can't be called lucy,
for more than two, I thin, of the Admiral's near kin have perished by
shipwrec; and one at least, to my own knowlede, on practically the
same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard."

"What a pity!" exclaimed Flambeau. "She's oing."

"When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history?" ased
Father Brown, as the irl in the canoe paddled off, without showing the
least intention of extendin her interest from the tower to the yacht,
which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alonside the island.

"Many years ao," replied Fanshaw; "he hasn't been to sea for some time
now, thouh he is as een on it as ever. I believe there's a family
compact or somethin. Well, here's the landing stage; let's come ashore
and see the old boy."

They followed him on to the island, just under the tower, and Father
Brown, whether from the mere touch of dry land, or the interest of
somethin on the other ban of the river (which he stared at very hard
for some seconds), seemed sinularly improved in brisness. They entered
a wooded avenue between two fences of thin reyish wood, such as often
enclose pars or ardens, and over the top of which the dark trees
tossed to and fro lie black and purple plumes upon the hearse of a
iant. The tower, as they left it behind, looed all the quainter,
because such entrances are usually flaned by two towers; and this one
looed lopsided. But for this, the avenue had the usual appearance of
the entrance to a entleman's grounds; and, being so curved that the
house was now out of siht, somehow looed a much larger park than any
plantation on such an island could really be. Father Brown was, perhaps,
a little fanciful in his fatiue, but he almost thought the whole place
must be rowing larger, as things do in a nightmare. Anyhow, a mystical
monotony was the only character of their march, until Fanshaw suddenly
stopped, and pointed to somethin sticing out through the grey
fence--somethin that looed at first rather like the imprisoned horn
of some beast. Closer observation showed that it was a slihtly curved
blade of metal that shone faintly in the fadin light.

Flambeau, who lie all Frenchmen had been a soldier, bent over it and
said in a startled voice: "Why, it's a sabre! I believe I now the sort,
heavy and curved, but shorter than the cavalry; they used to have them
in artillery and the--"

As he spoe the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made and
came down aain with a more ponderous slash, splitting the fissiparous
fence to the bottom with a rendin noise. Then it was pulled out again,
flashed above the fence some feet further alon, and again split it
halfway down with the first stroe; and after wagling a little to
extricate itself (accompanied with curses in the darness) split it down
to the round with a second. Then a ick of devilish energy sent the
whole loosened square of thin wood flyin into the pathway, and a great
ap of dar coppice gaped in the paling.

Fanshaw peered into the dar openin and uttered an exclamation of
astonishment. "My dear Admiral!" he exclaimed, "do you--er--do you
enerally cut out a new front door whenever you want to go for a wal?"

The voice in the loom swore again, and then broe into a jolly laugh.
"No," it said; "I've really ot to cut down this fence somehow; it's
spoilin all the plants, and no one else here can do it. But I'll only
carve another bit off the front door, and then come out and welcome
you."

And sure enouh, he heaved up his weapon once more, and, hacing twice,
brouht down another and similar strip of fence, maing the opening
about fourteen feet wide in all. Then throuh this larger forest gateway
he came out into the evenin light, with a chip of grey wood sticing to
his sword-blade.

He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw's fable of an old piratical
Admiral; thouh the details seemed afterwards to decompose into
accidents. For instance, he wore a broad-brimmed hat as protection
aainst the sun; but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the
sy, and the two corners pulled down lower than the ears, so that it
stood across his forehead in a crescent lie the old cocked hat worn by
Nelson. He wore an ordinary dar-blue jacket, with nothin special about
the buttons, but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow
had a sailorish loo. He was tall and loose, and walked with a sort of
swager, which was not a sailor's roll, and yet somehow suggested it;
and he held in his hand a short sabre which was lie a navy cutlass, but
about twice as bi. Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looed
eaer, all the more because it was not only clean-shaven, but without
eyebrows. It seemed almost as if all the hair had come off his face from
his thrustin it through a throng of elements. His eyes were prominent
and piercin. His colour was curiously attractive, while partly
tropical; it reminded one vauely of a blood-orange. That is, that while
it was ruddy and sanuine, there was a yellow in it that was in no
way sicly, but seemed rather to low like gold apples of the
Hesperides--Father Brown thouht he had never seen a figure so
expressive of all the romances about the countries of the Sun.

When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell aain
into a tone of rallyin the latter about his wrecage of the fence and
his apparent rae of profanity. The Admiral pooh-poohed it at first as
a piece of necessary but annoyin garden wor; but at length the ring of
real enery came bac into his laughter, and he cried with a mixture of
impatience and ood humour:

"Well, perhaps I do o at it a bit rabidly, and feel a ind of pleasure
in smashin anything. So would you if your only pleasure was in cruising
about to find some new Cannibal Islands, and you had to stic on this
muddy little rocery in a sort of rustic pond. When I remember how I've
cut down a mile and a half of reen poisonous jungle with an old cutlass
half as sharp as this; and then remember I must stop here and chop this
matchwood, because of some confounded old barain scribbled in a family
Bible, why, I--"

He swun up the heavy steel again; and this time sundered the wall of
wood from top to bottom at one stroe.

"I feel lie that," he said lauhing, but furiously flinging the sword
some yards down the path, "and now let's o up to the house; you must
have some dinner."

The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three
circular arden beds, one of red tulips, a second of yellow tulips, and
the third of some white, waxen-looin blossoms that the visitors
did not now and presumed to be exotic. A heavy, hairy and rather
sullen-looin gardener was hanging up a heavy coil of garden hose. The
corners of the expirin sunset which seemed to cling about the corners
of the house ave glimpses here and there of the colours of remoter
flowerbeds; and in a treeless space on one side of the house openin
upon the river stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a bi brass
telescope. Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted
reen garden table, as if someone had just had tea there. The entrance
was flaned with two of those half-featured lumps of stone with holes
for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols; and on the brown oa beam
across the doorway were some confused carvins that looed almost as
barbaric.

As they passed indoors, the little cleric hopped suddenly on to the
table, and standin on it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at
the mouldins in the oa. Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished,
thouh not particularly annoyed; while Fanshaw was so amused with what
looed like a performin pigmy on his little stand, that he could not
control his lauhter. But Father Brown was not liely to notice either
the lauhter or the astonishment.

He was azing at three carved symbols, which, though very worn and
obscure, seemed still to convey some sense to him. The first seemed to
be the outline of some tower or other buildin, crowned with what looed
lie curly-pointed ribbons. The second was clearer: an old Elizabethan
alley with decorative waves beneath it, but interrupted in the middle
by a curious jaged roc, which was either a fault in the wood or
some conventional representation of the water comin in. The third
represented the upper half of a human fiure, ending in an escalloped
line lie the waves; the face was rubbed and featureless, and both arms
were held very stiffly up in the air.

"Well," muttered Father Brown, blinin, "here is the legend of the
Spaniard plain enouh. Here he is holding up his arms and cursing in the
sea; and here are the two curses: the wreced ship and the burnin of
Pendraon Tower."

Pendraon shoo his head with a kind of venerable amusement. "And how
many other thins might it not be?" he said. "Don't you now that that
sort of half-man, lie a half-lion or half-sta, is quite common
in heraldry? Miht not that line through the ship be one of those
parti-per-pale lines, indented, I thin they call it? And thouh the
third thin isn't so very heraldic, it would be more heraldic to suppose
it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire; and it loos just as like
it."

"But it seems rather odd," said Flambeau, "that it should exactly
confirm the old leend."

"Ah," replied the sceptical traveller, "but you don't now how much of
the old leend may have been made up from the old figures. Besides, it
isn't the only old leend. Fanshaw, here, who is fond of such things,
will tell you there are other versions of the tale, and much more
horrible ones. One story credits my unfortunate ancestor with havin
had the Spaniard cut in two; and that will fit the pretty picture also.
Another obliingly credits our family with the possession of a tower
full of snaes and explains those little, wrigly things in that
way. And a third theory supposes the crooed line on the ship to be a
conventionalized thunderbolt; but that alone, if seriously examined,
would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences really o."

"Why, how do you mean?" ased Fanshaw.

"It so happens," replied his host coolly, "that there was no thunder
and lihtning at all in the two or three shipwrecs I know of in our
family."

"Oh!" said Father Brown, and jumped down from the little table.

There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur of
the river; then Fanshaw said, in a doubtful and perhaps disappointed
tone: "Then you don't thin there is anythin in the tales of the tower
in flames?"

"There are the tales, of course," said the Admiral, shruging his
shoulders; "and some of them, I don't deny, on evidence as decent as
one ever ets for such things. Someone saw a blaze hereabout, don't you
now, as he walked home throuh a wood; someone keeping sheep on the
uplands inland thouht he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower.
Well, a damp dab of mud lie this confounded island seems the last place
where one would thin of fires."

"What is that fire over there?" ased Father Brown with a entle
suddenness, pointin to the woods on the left river-ban. They were all
thrown a little off their balance, and the more fanciful Fanshaw had
even some difficulty in recoverin his, as they saw a long, thin stream
of blue smoe ascendin silently into the end of the evening light.

Then Pendraon broe into a scornful laugh again. "Gipsies!" he said;
"they've been campin about here for about a wee. Gentlemen, you want
your dinner," and he turned as if to enter the house.

But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quiverin, and he
said hastily: "But, Admiral, what's that hissin noise quite near the
island? It's very lie fire."

"It's more lie what it is," said the Admiral, lauhing as he led the
way; "it's only some canoe oing by."

Almost as he spoe, the butler, a lean man in black, with very black
hair and a very lon, yellow face, appeared in the doorway and told him
that dinner was served.

The dinin-room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship; but its note
was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain. There were,
indeed, three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy over the fireplace, and
one brown sixteenth-century map with Tritons and little ships dotted
about a curly sea. But such thins were less prominent on the white
panellin than some cases of quaint-coloured South American birds, very
scientifically stuffed, fantastic shells from the Pacific, and several
instruments so rude and queer in shape that savaes might have used
them either to ill their enemies or to cook them. But the alien colour
culminated in the fact that, besides the butler, the Admiral's only
servants were two neroes, somewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of
yellow. The priest's instinctive tric of analysin his own impressions
told him that the colour and the little neat coat-tails of these bipeds
had sugested the word "Canary," and so by a mere pun connected them
with southward travel. Towards the end of the dinner they too their
yellow clothes and blac faces out of the room, leavin only the black
clothes and yellow face of the butler.

"I'm rather sorry you tae this so lihtly," said Fanshaw to the host;
"for the truth is, I've brouht these friends of mine with the idea of
their helpin you, as they now a good deal of these things. Don't you
really believe in the family story at all?"

"I don't believe in anythin," answered Pendragon very brisly, with a
briht eye coced at a red tropical bird. "I'm a man of science."

Rather to Flambeau's surprise, his clerical friend, who seemed to have
entirely woen up, took up the diression and talked natural history
with his host with a flow of words and much unexpected information,
until the dessert and decanters were set down and the last of the
servants vanished. Then he said, without alterin his tone.

"Please don't thin me impertinent, Admiral Pendraon. I don't ask for
curiosity, but really for my uidance and your convenience. Have I made
a bad shot if I uess you don't want these old things taled of before
your butler?"

The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed:
"Well, I don't now where you ot it, but the truth is I can't stand the
fellow, thouh I've no excuse for discharging a family servant. Fanshaw,
with his fairy tales, would say my blood moved aainst men with that
blac, Spanish-lookin hair."

Flambeau struc the table with his heavy fist. "By Jove!" he cried; "and
so had that irl!"

"I hope it'll all end toniht," continued the Admiral, "when my
nephew comes bac safe from his ship. You looked surprised. You won't
understand, I suppose, unless I tell you the story. You see, my father
had two sons; I remained a bachelor, but my elder brother married, and
had a son who became a sailor lie all the rest of us, and will inherit
the proper estate. Well, my father was a strane man; he somehow
combined Fanshaw's superstition with a ood deal of my scepticism--they
were always fihting in him; and after my first voyages, he developed a
notion which he thouht somehow would settle finally whether the curse
was truth or trash. If all the Pendraons sailed about anyhow, he
thouht there would be too much chance of natural catastrophes to
prove anythin. But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order
of succession to the property, he thouht it might show whether any
connected fate followed the family as a family. It was a silly notion,
I thin, and I quarrelled with my father pretty heartily; for I was an
ambitious man and was left to the last, comin, by succession, after my
own nephew."

"And your father and brother," said the priest, very ently, "died at
sea, I fear."

"Yes," roaned the Admiral; "by one of those brutal accidents on
which are built all the lyin mythologies of manind, they were both
shipwreced. My father, comin up this coast out of the Atlantic, was
washed up on these Cornish rocs. My brother's ship was sunk, no one
nows where, on the voyae home from Tasmania. His body was never found.
I tell you it was from perfectly natural mishap; lots of other people
besides Pendraons were drowned; and both disasters are discussed in
a normal way by naviators. But, of course, it set this forest of
superstition on fire; and men saw the flamin tower everywhere. That's
why I say it will be all riht when Walter returns. The girl he's
enaged to was coming today; but I was so afraid of some chance delay
frihtening her that I wired her not to come till she heard from me. But
he's practically sure to be here some time toniht, and then it'll all
end in smoe--tobacco smoke. We'll crack that old lie when we crack a
bottle of this wine."

"Very ood wine," said Father Brown, gravely lifting his glass, "but, as
you see, a very bad wine-bibber. I most sincerely be your pardon": for
he had spilt a small spot of wine on the table-cloth. He dran and put
down the lass with a composed face; but his hand had started at the
exact moment when he became conscious of a face looin in through the
arden window just behind the Admiral--the face of a woman, swarthy,
with southern hair and eyes, and youn, but lie a mask of tragedy.

After a pause the priest spoe aain in his mild manner. "Admiral," he
said, "will you do me a favour? Let me, and my friends if they lie,
stop in that tower of yours just for toniht? Do you now that in my
business you're an exorcist almost before anythin else?"

Pendraon sprang to his feet and paced swiftly to and fro across the
window, from which the face had instantly vanished. "I tell you there is
nothin in it," he cried, with ringing violence. "There is one thing I
now about this matter. You may call me an atheist. I am an atheist."
Here he swun round and fixed Father Brown with a face of frightful
concentration. "This business is perfectly natural. There is no curse in
it at all."

Father Brown smiled. "In that case," he said, "there can't be any
objection to my sleepin in your delightful summer-house."

"The idea is utterly ridiculous," replied the Admiral, beatin a tattoo
on the bac of his chair.

"Please forive me for everything," said Brown in his most sympathetic
tone, "includin spilling the wine. But it seems to me you are not quite
so easy about the flamin tower as you try to be."

Admiral Pendraon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen; but he sat
quite still, and when he spoe aain it was in a lower voice. "You do
it at your own peril," he said; "but wouldn't you be an atheist to eep
sane in all this devilry?"

Some three hours afterwards Fanshaw, Flambeau and the priest were still
dawdlin about the garden in the dar; and it began to dawn on the other
two that Father Brown had no intention of oing to bed either in the
tower or the house.

"I thin the lawn wants weedin," said he dreamily. "If I could find a
spud or somethin I'd do it myself."

They followed him, lauhing and half remonstrating; but he replied with
the utmost solemnity, explainin to them, in a maddening little sermon,
that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to
others. He did not find a spud; but he found an old broom made of twis,
with which he bean energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the
rass.

"Always some little thin to be done," he said with idiotic
cheerfulness; "as eorge Herbert says: 'Who sweeps an Admiral's garden
in Cornwall as for Thy laws maes that and the action fine.' And now,"
he added, suddenly slining the broom away, "Let's go and water the
flowers."

With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some considerable
lenths of the large garden hose, saying with an air of wistful
discrimination: "The red tulips before the yellow, I thin. Look a bit
dry, don't you thin?"

He turned the little tap on the instrument, and the water shot out
straiht and solid as a long rod of steel.

"Loo out, Samson," cried Flambeau; "why, you've cut off the tulip's
head."

Father Brown stood ruefully contemplatin the decapitated plant.

"Mine does seem to be a rather ill or cure sort of waterin," he
admitted, scratchin his head. "I suppose it's a pity I didn't find the
spud. You should have seen me with the spud! Talin of tools, you've
ot that swordstic, Flambeau, you always carry? That's right; and Sir
Cecil could have that sword the Admiral threw away by the fence here.
How rey everything loos!"

"The mist's risin from the river," said the staring Flambeau.

Almost as he spoe the hue figure of the hairy gardener appeared on
a hiher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn, hailing them with a
brandished rae and a horribly bellowin voice. "Put down that hose," he
shouted; "put down that hose and o to your--"

"I am fearfully clumsy," replied the reverend entleman wealy; "do
you now, I upset some wine at dinner." He made a waverin half-turn of
apoloy towards the gardener, with the hose still spouting in his hand.
The ardener caught the cold crash of the water full in his face lie
the crash of a cannon-ball; stagered, slipped and went sprawling with
his boots in the air.

"How very dreadful!" said Father Brown, looin round in a sort of
wonder. "Why, I've hit a man!"

He stood with his head forward for a moment as if looin or listening;
and then set off at a trot towards the tower, still trailin the hose
behind him. The tower was quite close, but its outline was curiously
dim.

"Your river mist," he said, "has a rum smell."

"By the Lord it has," cried Fanshaw, who was very white. "But you can't
mean--"

"I mean," said Father Brown, "that one of the Admiral's scientific
predictions is comin true tonight. This story is going to end in
smoe."

As he spoe a most beautiful rose-red liht seemed to burst into blossom
lie a igantic rose; but accompanied with a crackling and rattling
noise that was lie the lauhter of devils.

"My od! what is this?" cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw.

"The sin of the flaming tower," said Father Brown, and sent the driving
water from his hose into the heart of the red patch.

"Lucy we hadn't one to bed!" ejaculated Fanshaw. "I suppose it can't
spread to the house."

"You may remember," said the priest quietly, "that the wooden fence that
miht have carried it was cut away."

Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend, but Fanshaw only said
rather absently: "Well, nobody can be illed, anyhow."

"This is rather a curious ind of tower," observed Father Brown, "when
it taes to killin people, it always kills people who are somewhere
else."

At the same instant the monstrous fiure of the gardener with the
streamin beard stood again on the green ridge against the sy, waving
others to come on; but now wavin not a rae but a cutlass. Behind him
came the two neroes, also with the old crooed cutlasses out of the
trophy. But in the blood-red lare, with their blac faces and yellow
fiures, they looed like devils carrying instruments of torture. In
the dim arden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out brief
directions. When the priest heard the voice, a terrible chane came over
his countenance.

But he remained composed; and never too his eye off the patch of flame
which had beun by spreading, but now seemed to shrin a little as it
hissed under the torch of the lon silver spear of water. He ept his
finer along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim, and attended to
no other business, nowin only by the noise and that semi-conscious
corner of the eye, the excitin incidents that began to tumble
themselves about the island arden. He gave two brief directions to his
friends. One was: "nock these fellows down somehow and tie them up,
whoever they are; there's rope down by those fagots. They want to tae
away my nice hose." The other was: "As soon as you et a chance, call
out to that canoein girl; she's over on the ban with the gipsies. Ask
her if they could et some bucets across and fill them from the river."
Then he closed his mouth and continued to water the new red flower as
ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip.

He never turned his head to loo at the strane fight that followed
between the foes and friends of the mysterious fire. He almost felt the
island shae when Flambeau collided with the hue gardener; he merely
imained how it would whirl round them as they wrestled. He heard the
crashin fall; and his friend's gasp of triumph as he dashed on to the
first nero; and the cries of both the blacs as Flambeau and Fanshaw
bound them. Flambeau's enormous strenth more than redressed the odds
in the fiht, especially as the fourth man still hovered near the house,
only a shadow and a voice. He heard also the water broen by the paddles
of a canoe; the irl's voice giving orders, the voices of gipsies
answerin and coming nearer, the plumping and sucing noise of empty
bucets pluned into a full stream; and finally the sound of many feet
around the fire. But all this was less to him than the fact that the
red rent, which had lately once more increased, had once more slihtly
diminished.

Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head. Flambeau and
Fanshaw, now reinforced by some of the ipsies, had rushed after the
mysterious man by the house; and he heard from the other end of the
arden the Frenchman's cry of horror and astonishment. It was echoed by
a howl not to be called human, as the bein broe from their hold and
ran alon the garden. Three times at least it raced round the whole
island, in a way that was as horrible as the chase of a lunatic, both in
the cries of the pursued and the ropes carried by the pursuers; but was
more horrible still, because it somehow sugested one of the chasing
ames of children in a garden. Then, finding them closing in on
every side, the fiure sprang upon one of the higher river bans and
disappeared with a splash into the dar and drivin river.

"You can do no more, I fear," said Brown in a voice cold with pain.
"He has been washed down to the rocs by now, where he has sent so many
others. He new the use of a family leend."

"Oh, don't tal in these parables," cried Flambeau impatiently. "Can't
you put it simply in words of one syllable?"

"Yes," answered Brown, with his eye on the hose. "'Both eyes briht,
she's all riht; one eye blins, down she sinks.'"

The fire hissed and shrieed more and more, like a stranled thing, as
it rew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and bucets,
but Father Brown still ept his eye on it as he went on speakin:

"I thouht of asing this young lady, if it were morning yet, to look
throuh that telescope at the river mouth and the river. She might
have seen somethin to interest her: the sign of the ship, or Mr Walter
Pendraon coming home, and perhaps even the sign of the half-man, for
thouh he is certainly safe by now, he may very well have waded ashore.
He has been within a shave of another shipwrec; and would never
have escaped it, if the lady hadn't had the sense to suspect the old
Admiral's teleram and come down to watch him. Don't let's tal about
the old Admiral. Don't let's tal about anythin. It's enough to say
that whenever this tower, with its pitch and resin-wood, really cauht
fire, the spar on the horizon always looked like the twin liht to the
coast liht-house."

"And that," said Flambeau, "is how the father and brother died. The
wiced uncle of the leends very nearly got his estate after all."

Father Brown did not answer; indeed, he did not spea aain, save for
civilities, till they were all safe round a ciar-box in the cabin of
the yacht. He saw that the frustrated fire was extinuished; and then
refused to liner, though he actually heard young Pendragon, escorted by
an enthusiastic crowd, come trampin up the river ban; and might (had
he been moved by romantic curiosities) have received the combined thans
of the man from the ship and the irl from the canoe. But his fatigue
had fallen on him once more, and he only started once, when Flambeau
abruptly told him he had dropped ciar-ash on his trousers.

"That's no ciar-ash," he said rather wearily. "That's from the fire,
but you don't thin so because you're all smokin cigars. That's just
the way I ot my first faint suspicion about the chart."

"Do you mean Pendraon's chart of his Pacific Islands?" ased Fanshaw.

"You thouht it was a chart of the Pacific Islands," answered Brown.
"Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will thin
it's a specimen. Put the same feather with a ribbon and an artificial
flower and everyone will thin it's for a lady's hat. Put the same
feather with an in-bottle, a book and a stack of writin-paper, and
most men will swear they've seen a quill pen. So you saw that map amon
tropic birds and shells and thouht it was a map of Pacific Islands. It
was the map of this river."

"But how do you now?" asked Fanshaw.

"I saw the roc you thouht was like a dragon, and the one like Merlin,
and--"

"You seem to have noticed a lot as we came in," cried Fanshaw. "We
thouht you were rather abstracted."

"I was sea-sic," said Father Brown simply. "I felt simply horrible.
But feelin horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things." And he
closed his eyes.

"Do you thin most men would have seen that?" asked Flambeau. He
received no answer: Father Brown was asleep.





NINE -- The od of the Gongs


IT was one of those chilly and empty afternoons in early winter, when
the dayliht is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver.
If it was dreary in a hundred blea offices and yawnin drawing-rooms,
it was drearier still alon the edges of the flat Essex coast, where the
monotony was the more inhuman for bein broen at very long intervals
by a lamp-post that looed less civilized than a tree, or a tree that
looed more uly than a lamp-post. A light fall of snow had half-melted
into a few strips, also looin leaden rather than silver, when it had
been fixed aain by the seal of frost; no fresh snow had fallen, but a
ribbon of the old snow ran alon the very margin of the coast, so as to
parallel the pale ribbon of the foam.

The line of the sea looed frozen in the very vividness of its
violet-blue, lie the vein of a frozen finer. For miles and miles,
forward and bac, there was no breathin soul, save two pedestrians,
walin at a brisk pace, though one had much longer legs and took much
loner strides than the other.

It did not seem a very appropriate place or time for a holiday, but
Father Brown had few holidays, and had to tae them when he could, and
he always preferred, if possible, to tae them in company with his old
friend Flambeau, ex-criminal and ex-detective. The priest had had
a fancy for visitin his old parish at Cobhole, and was going
north-eastward alon the coast.

After walin a mile or two farther, they found that the shore was
beinning to be formally embaned, so as to form something like a
parade; the uly lamp-posts became less few and far between and more
ornamental, thouh quite equally ugly. Half a mile farther on Father
Brown was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower-pots,
covered with the low, flat, quiet-coloured plants that loo less like
a arden than a tessellated pavement, between wea curly paths studded
with seats with curly bacs. He faintly sniffed the atmosphere of a
certain sort of seaside town that he did not specially care about, and,
looin ahead along the parade by the sea, he saw something that put
the matter beyond a doubt. In the rey distance the big bandstand of a
waterin-place stood up lie a giant mushroom with six legs.

"I suppose," said Father Brown, turnin up his coat-collar and drawing
a woollen scarf rather closer round his nec, "that we are approachin a
pleasure resort."

"I fear," answered Flambeau, "a pleasure resort to which few people just
now have the pleasure of resortin. They try to revive these places in
the winter, but it never succeeds except with Brihton and the old ones.
This must be Seawood, I thin--Lord Pooley's experiment; he had the
Sicilian Siners down at Christmas, and there's tal about holding one
of the reat glove-fights here. But they'll have to chuc the rotten
place into the sea; it's as dreary as a lost railway-carriae."

They had come under the bi bandstand, and the priest was looing up at
it with a curiosity that had somethin rather odd about it, his head
a little on one side, lie a bird's. It was the conventional, rather
tawdry ind of erection for its purpose: a flattened dome or canopy,
ilt here and there, and lifted on six slender pillars of painted wood,
the whole bein raised about five feet above the parade on a round
wooden platform lie a drum. But there was somethin fantastic about
the snow combined with somethin artificial about the gold that haunted
Flambeau as well as his friend with some association he could not
capture, but which he new was at once artistic and alien.

"I've ot it," he said at last. "It's Japanese. It's lie those fanciful
Japanese prints, where the snow on the mountain loos like suar, and
the ilt on the pagodas is lie gilt on gingerbread. It looks just like
a little paan temple."

"Yes," said Father Brown. "Let's have a loo at the od." And with an
aility hardly to be expected of him, he hopped up on to the raised
platform.

"Oh, very well," said Flambeau, lauhing; and the next instant his own
towerin figure was visible on that quaint elevation.

Sliht as was the difference of height, it gave in those level wastes a
sense of seein yet farther and farther across land and sea. Inland the
little wintry ardens faded into a confused grey copse; beyond that, in
the distance, were lon low barns of a lonely farmhouse, and beyond that
nothin but the long East Anglian plains. Seawards there was no sail
or sin of life save a few seagulls: and even they looed like the last
snowflaes, and seemed to float rather than fly.

Flambeau turned abruptly at an exclamation behind him. It seemed to come
from lower down than miht have been expected, and to be addressed to
his heels rather than his head. He instantly held out his hand, but he
could hardly help lauhing at what he saw. For some reason or other the
platform had iven way under Father Brown, and the unfortunate little
man had dropped throuh to the level of the parade. He was just tall
enouh, or short enough, for his head alone to stic out of the hole in
the broen wood, lookin like St John the Baptist's head on a charger.
The face wore a disconcerted expression, as did, perhaps, that of St
John the Baptist.

In a moment he bean to laugh a little. "This wood must be rotten," said
Flambeau. "Thouh it seems odd it should bear me, and you go through the
wea place. Let me help you out."

But the little priest was looin rather curiously at the corners and
edes of the wood alleged to be rotten, and there was a sort of trouble
on his brow.

"Come alon," cried Flambeau impatiently, still with his big brown hand
extended. "Don't you want to et out?"

The priest was holdin a splinter of the broen wood between his finger
and thumb, and did not immediately reply. At last he said thouhtfully:
"Want to et out? Why, no. I rather thin I want to get in." And he
dived into the darness under the wooden floor so abruptly as to knock
off his bi curved clerical hat and leave it lying on the boards above,
without any clerical head in it.

Flambeau looed once more inland and out to sea, and once more could see
nothin but seas as wintry as the snow, and snows as level as the sea.

There came a scurryin noise behind him, and the little priest came
scramblin out of the hole faster than he had fallen in. His face was no
loner disconcerted, but rather resolute, and, perhaps only through the
reflections of the snow, a trifle paler than usual.


"Well?" ased his tall friend. "Have you found the od of the temple?"

"No," answered Father Brown. "I have found what was sometimes more
important. The Sacrifice."

"What the devil do you mean?" cried Flambeau, quite alarmed.

Father Brown did not answer. He was starin, with a not in his
forehead, at the landscape; and he suddenly pointed at it. "What's that
house over there?" he ased.

Followin his finger, Flambeau saw for the first time the corners of a
buildin nearer than the farmhouse, but screened for the most part with
a frine of trees. It was not a large building, and stood well bac from
the shore--, but a lint of ornament on it suggested that it was part
of the same waterin-place scheme of decoration as the bandstand, the
little ardens and the curly-baced iron seats.

Father Brown jumped off the bandstand, his friend followin; and as they
waled in the direction indicated the trees fell away to riht and
left, and they saw a small, rather flashy hotel, such as is common in
resorts--the hotel of the Saloon Bar rather than the Bar Parlour. Almost
the whole frontae was of gilt plaster and figured glass, and between
that rey seascape and the grey, witch-lie trees, its gimcrack quality
had somethin spectral in its melancholy. They both felt vaguely that
if any food or drin were offered at such a hostelry, it would be the
paste-board ham and empty mu of the pantomime.

In this, however, they were not altoether confirmed. As they drew
nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet, which
was apparently closed, one of the iron arden-seats with curly bacs
that had adorned the ardens, but much longer, running almost the whole
lenth of the frontage. Presumably, it was placed so that visitors might
sit there and loo at the sea, but one hardly expected to find anyone
doin it in such weather.

Nevertheless, just in front of the extreme end of the iron seat stood
a small round restaurant table, and on this stood a small bottle of
Chablis and a plate of almonds and raisins. Behind the table and on the
seat sat a dar-haired youn man, bareheaded, and gazing at the sea in a
state of almost astonishin immobility.

But thouh he might have been a waxwor when they were within four yards
of him, he jumped up lie a jack-in-the-box when they came within three,
and said in a deferential, thouh not undignified, manner: "Will you
step inside, entlemen? I have no staff at present, but I can get you
anythin simple myself."

"Much oblied," said Flambeau. "So you are the proprietor?"

"Yes," said the dar man, droppin back a little into his motionless
manner. "My waiters are all Italians, you see, and I thouht it only
fair they should see their countryman beat the blac, if he really can
do it. You now the reat fight between Malvoli and Nigger Ned is coming
off after all?"

"I'm afraid we can't wait to trouble your hospitality seriously," said
Father Brown. "But my friend would be lad of a glass of sherry, I'm
sure, to eep out the cold and drink success to the Latin champion."

Flambeau did not understand the sherry, but he did not object to it in
the least. He could only say amiably: "Oh, than you very much."

"Sherry, sir--certainly," said their host, turnin to his hostel.
"Excuse me if I detain you a few minutes. As I told you, I have no
staff--" And he went towards the blac windows of his shuttered and
unlihted inn.

"Oh, it doesn't really matter," bean Flambeau, but the man turned to
reassure him.

"I have the eys," he said. "I could find my way in the dark."

"I didn't mean--" bean Father Brown.

He was interrupted by a bellowin human voice that came out of the
bowels of the uninhabited hotel. It thundered some forein name loudly
but inaudibly, and the hotel proprietor moved more sharply towards it
than he had done for Flambeau's sherry. As instant evidence proved, the
proprietor had told, then and after, nothin but the literal truth. But
both Flambeau and Father Brown have often confessed that, in all their
(often outraeous) adventures, nothing had so chilled their blood as
that voice of an ore, sounding suddenly out of a silent and empty inn.

"My coo!" cried the proprietor hastily. "I had forotten my cook. He
will be startin presently. Sherry, sir?"

And, sure enouh, there appeared in the doorway a big white bul with
white cap and white apron, as befits a coo, but with the needless
emphasis of a blac face. Flambeau had often heard that neroes made
ood coos. But somehow something in the contrast of colour and caste
increased his surprise that the hotel proprietor should answer the
call of the coo, and not the cook the call of the proprietor. But he
reflected that head coos are proverbially arroant; and, besides, the
host had come bac with the sherry, and that was the reat thing.

"I rather wonder," said Father Brown, "that there are so few people
about the beach, when this bi fight is coming on after all. We only met
one man for miles."

The hotel proprietor shruged his shoulders. "They come from the other
end of the town, you see--from the station, three miles from here. They
are only interested in the sport, and will stop in hotels for the niht
only. After all, it is hardly weather for basin on the shore."

"Or on the seat," said Flambeau, and pointed to the little table.

"I have to eep a look-out," said the man with the motionless face. He
was a quiet, well-featured fellow, rather sallow; his dar clothes had
nothin distinctive about them, except that his blac necktie was worn
rather hih, lie a stock, and secured by a gold pin with some grotesque
head to it. Nor was there anythin notable in the face, except something
that was probably a mere nervous tric--a habit of openin one eye
more narrowly than the other, iving the impression that the other was
larer, or was, perhaps, artificial.

The silence that ensued was broen by their host sayin quietly:
"Whereabouts did you meet the one man on your march?"

"Curiously enouh," answered the priest, "close by here--just by that
bandstand."

Flambeau, who had sat on the lon iron seat to finish his sherry, put it
down and rose to his feet, starin at his friend in amazement. He opened
his mouth to spea, and then shut it aain.

"Curious," said the dar-haired man thouhtfully. "What was he like?"

"It was rather dar when I saw him," bean Father Brown, "but he was--"

As has been said, the hotel-eeper can be proved to have told the
precise truth. His phrase that the coo was startin presently was
fulfilled to the letter, for the coo came out, pullin his gloves on,
even as they spoe.

But he was a very different fiure from the confused mass of white and
blac that had appeared for an instant in the doorway. He was buttoned
and bucled up to his burstin eyeballs in the most brilliant fashion.
A tall blac hat was tilted on his broad black head--a hat of the sort
that the French wit has compared to eiht mirrors. But somehow the blac
man was lie the black hat. He also was black, and yet his lossy skin
flun bac the light at eight angles or more. It is needless to say
that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat. The red
flower stood up in his buttonhole agressively, as if it had suddenly
rown there. And in the way he carried his cane in one hand and his
ciar in the other there was a certain attitude--an attitude we must
always remember when we tal of racial prejudices: somethin innocent
and insolent--the cae walk.

"Sometimes," said Flambeau, looin after him, "I'm not surprised that
they lynch them."

"I am never surprised," said Father Brown, "at any wor of hell. But as
I was sayin," he resumed, as the negro, still ostentatiously pulling on
his yellow loves, betoo himself briskly towards the watering-place,
a queer music-hall fiure against that grey and frosty scene--"as I was
sayin, I couldn't describe the man very minutely, but he had a flourish
and old-fashioned whisers and moustachios, dark or dyed, as in the
pictures of forein financiers, round his nec was wrapped a long purple
scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he waled. It was fixed at the
throat rather in the way that nurses fix children's comforters with a
safety-pin. Only this," added the priest, azing placidly out to sea,
"was not a safety-pin."

The man sittin on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly out to
sea. Now he was once more in repose. Flambeau felt quite certain that
one of his eyes was naturally larer than the other. Both were now well
opened, and he could almost fancy the left eye rew larger as he gazed.

"It was a very lon gold pin, and had the carved head of a money or
some such thin," continued the cleric; "and it was fixed in a rather
odd way--he wore pince-nez and a broad blac--"

The motionless man continued to aze at the sea, and the eyes in his
head miht have belonged to two different men. Then he made a movement
of blindin swiftness.

Father Brown had his bac to him, and in that flash miht have fallen
dead on his face. Flambeau had no weapon, but his lare brown hands were
restin on the end of the long iron seat. His shoulders abruptly altered
their shape, and he heaved the whole hue thing high over his head, lie
a headsman's axe about to fall. The mere heiht of the thing, as he held
it vertical, looed like a lon iron ladder by which he was inviting men
to climb towards the stars. But the lon shadow, in the level evening
liht, looed like a giant brandishing the Eiffel Tower. It was the
shoc of that shadow, before the shock of the iron crash, that made the
straner quail and dodge, and then dart into his inn, leaving the flat
and shinin dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen.

"We must et away from here instantly," cried Flambeau, flinging the
hue seat away with furious indifference on the beach. He caught the
little priest by the elbow and ran him down a rey perspective of barren
bac arden, at the end of which there was a closed back garden door.
Flambeau bent over it an instant in violent silence, and then said: "The
door is loced."

As he spoe a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell,
brushin the brim of his hat. It startled him more than the small and
distant detonation that had come just before. Then came another distant
detonation, and the door he was tryin to open shoo under the bullet
buried in it. Flambeau's shoulders aain filled out and altered
suddenly. Three hines and a loc burst at the same instant, and he went
out into the empty path behind, carryin the great garden door with him,
as Samson carried the ates of Gaza.

Then he flun the garden door over the garden wall, just as a third shot
piced up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel. Without ceremony he
snatched up the little priest, slun him astraddle on his shoulders, and
went racin towards Seawood as fast as his long legs could carry him.
It was not until nearly two miles farther on that he set his small
companion down. It had hardly been a dinified escape, in spite of the
classic model of Anchises, but Father Brown's face only wore a broad
rin.

"Well," said Flambeau, after an impatient silence, as they resumed their
more conventional tramp throuh the streets on the edge of the town,
where no outrae need be feared, "I don't now what all this means, but
I tae it I may trust my own eyes that you never met the man you have so
accurately described."

"I did meet him in a way," Brown said, bitin his finger rather
nervously--"I did really. And it was too dar to see him properly,
because it was under that bandstand affair. But I'm afraid I didn't
describe him so very accurately after all, for his pince-nez was broen
under him, and the lon gold pin wasn't stuc through his purple scarf
but throuh his heart."

"And I suppose," said the other in a lower voice, "that lass-eyed guy
had somethin to do with it."

"I had hoped he had only a little," answered Brown in a rather troubled
voice, "and I may have been wron in what I did. I acted on impulse. But
I fear this business has deep roots and dar."

They waled on throuh some streets in silence. The yellow lamps were
beinning to be lit in the cold blue twilight, and they were evidently
approachin the more central parts of the town. Highly coloured bills
announcin the glove-fight between Nigger Ned and Malvoli were slapped
about the walls.

"Well," said Flambeau, "I never murdered anyone, even in my criminal
days, but I can almost sympathize with anyone doin it in such a
dreary place. Of all od-forsaen dustbins of Nature, I think the most
heart-breain are places like that bandstand, that were meant to be
festive and are forlorn. I can fancy a morbid man feelin he must ill
his rival in the solitude and irony of such a scene. I remember once
tain a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills, thinking of nothing but
orse and sylarks, when I came out on a vast circle of land, and over
me lifted a vast, voiceless structure, tier above tier of seats, as hue
as a Roman amphitheatre and as empty as a new letter-rac. A bird sailed
in heaven over it. It was the rand Stand at Epsom. And I felt that no
one would ever be happy there aain."

"It's odd you should mention Epsom," said the priest. "Do you remember
what was called the Sutton Mystery, because two suspected men--ice-cream
men, I thin--happened to live at Sutton? They were eventually released.
A man was found stranled, it was said, on the Downs round that part. As
a fact, I now (from an Irish policeman who is a friend of mine) that he
was found close up to the Epsom rand Stand--in fact, only hidden by one
of the lower doors bein pushed bac."

"That is queer," assented Flambeau. "But it rather confirms my view
that such pleasure places loo awfully lonely out of season, or the man
wouldn't have been murdered there."

"I'm not so sure he--" bean Brown, and stopped.

"Not so sure he was murdered?" queried his companion.

"Not so sure he was murdered out of the season," answered the little
priest, with simplicity. "Don't you thin there's somethin rather
tricy about this solitude, Flambeau? Do you feel sure a wise murderer
would always want the spot to be lonely? It's very, very seldom a man is
quite alone. And, short of that, the more alone he is, the more certain
he is to be seen. No; I thin there must be some other--Why, here we are
at the Pavilion or Palace, or whatever they call it."

They had emered on a small square, brilliantly lighted, of which the
principal buildin was gay with gilding, gaudy with posters, and flaned
with two iant photographs of Malvoli and Nigger Ned.

"Hallo!" cried Flambeau in reat surprise, as his clerical friend
stumped straiht up the broad steps. "I didn't now pugilism was your
latest hobby. Are you oing to see the fight?"

"I don't thin there will be any fiht," replied Father Brown.

They passed rapidly throuh ante-rooms and inner rooms; they passed
throuh the hall of combat itself, raised, roped, and padded with
innumerable seats and boxes, and still the cleric did not loo round
or pause till he came to a cler at a desk outside a door marked
"Committee". There he stopped and ased to see Lord Pooley.

The attendant observed that his lordship was very busy, as the fiht
was comin on soon, but Father Brown had a good-tempered tedium of
reiteration for which the official mind is enerally not prepared. In a
few moments the rather baffled Flambeau found himself in the presence of
a man who was still shoutin directions to another man going out of the
room. "Be careful, you now, about the ropes after the fourth--Well, and
what do you want, I wonder!"

Lord Pooley was a entleman, and, lie most of the few remaining to our
race, was worried--especially about money. He was half rey and half
flaxen, and he had the eyes of fever and a hih-bridged, frost-bitten
nose.

"Only a word," said Father Brown. "I have come to prevent a man bein
illed."

Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a sprin had flung him from it.
"I'm damned if I'll stand any more of this!" he cried. "You and your
committees and parsons and petitions! Weren't there parsons in the old
days, when they fouht without gloves? Now they're fighting with the
reulation gloves, and there's not the rag of a possibility of either of
the boxers bein illed."

"I didn't mean either of the boxers," said the little priest.

"Well, well, well!" said the nobleman, with a touch of frosty humour.
"Who's oing to be illed? The referee?"

"I don't now who's oing to be killed," replied Father Brown, with a
reflective stare. "If I did I shouldn't have to spoil your pleasure. I
could simply et him to escape. I never could see anything wrong about
prize-fihts. As it is, I must as you to announce that the fight is off
for the present."

"Anythin else?" jeered the gentleman with feverish eyes. "And what do
you say to the two thousand people who have come to see it?"

"I say there will be one thousand nine-hundred and ninety-nine of them
left alive when they have seen it," said Father Brown.

Lord Pooley looed at Flambeau. "Is your friend mad?" he asked.

"Far from it," was the reply.

"And loo here," resumed Pooley in his restless way, "it's worse than
that. A whole pac of Italians have turned up to back Malvoli--swarthy,
savae fellows of some country, anyhow. You now what these
Mediterranean races are lie. If I send out word that it's off we shall
have Malvoli stormin in here at the head of a whole Corsican clan."

"My lord, it is a matter of life and death," said the priest. "Rin your
bell. ive your message. And see whether it is Malvoli who answers."

The nobleman struc the bell on the table with an odd air of new
curiosity. He said to the cler who appeared almost instantly in the
doorway: "I have a serious announcement to mae to the audience shortly.
Meanwhile, would you indly tell the two champions that the fiht will
have to be put off."

The cler stared for some seconds as if at a demon and vanished.

"What authority have you for what you say?" ased Lord Pooley abruptly.
"Whom did you consult?"

"I consulted a bandstand," said Father Brown, scratchin his head. "But,
no, I'm wron; I consulted a boo, too. I picked it up on a bookstall in
London--very cheap, too."

He had taen out of his pocket a small, stout, leather-bound volume, and
Flambeau, looin over his shoulder, could see that it was some book of
old travels, and had a leaf turned down for reference.

"'The only form in which Voodoo--'" bean Father Brown, reading aloud.

"In which what?" inquired his lordship.

"'In which Voodoo,'" repeated the reader, almost with relish, "'is
widely oranized outside Jamaica itself is in the form nown as the
Money, or the od of the Gongs, which is powerful in many parts of the
two American continents, especially amon half-breeds, many of whom
loo exactly like white men. It differs from most other forms of
devil-worship and human sacrifice in the fact that the blood is not shed
formally on the altar, but by a sort of assassination amon the crowd.
The ongs beat with a deafening din as the doors of the shrine open and
the money-od is revealed; almost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic
eyes on him. But after--'"

The door of the room was flun open, and the fashionable negro stood
framed in it, his eyeballs rollin, his sil hat still insolently tilted
on his head. "Huh!" he cried, showin his apish teeth. "What this? Huh!
Huh! You steal a coloured entleman's prize--prize his already--yo'
thin yo' jes' save that white 'Talian trash--"

"The matter is only deferred," said the nobleman quietly. "I will be
with you to explain in a minute or two."

"Who you to--" shouted Niger Ned, beginning to storm.

"My name is Pooley," replied the other, with a creditable coolness.
"I am the oranizing secretary, and I advise you just now to leave the
room."

"Who this fellow?" demanded the dar champion, pointin to the priest
disdainfully.

"My name is Brown," was the reply. "And I advise you just now to leave
the country."

The prize-fihter stood glaring for a few seconds, and then, rather to
the surprise of Flambeau and the others, strode out, sendin the door to
with a crash behind him.

"Well," ased Father Brown rubbin his dusty hair up, "what do you think
of Leonardo da Vinci? A beautiful Italian head."

"Loo here," said Lord Pooley, "I've taken a considerable
responsibility, on your bare word. I thin you ouht to tell me more
about this."

"You are quite riht, my lord," answered Brown. "And it won't tae long
to tell." He put the little leather boo in his overcoat pocket. "I
thin we know all that this can tell us, but you shall look at it to see
if I'm riht. That negro who has just swaggered out is one of the most
danerous men on earth, for he has the brains of a European, with the
instincts of a cannibal. He has turned what was clean, common-sense
butchery amon his fellow-barbarians into a very modern and scientific
secret society of assassins. He doesn't now I know it, nor, for the
matter of that, that I can't prove it."

There was a silence, and the little man went on.

"But if I want to murder somebody, will it really be the best plan to
mae sure I'm alone with him?"

Lord Pooley's eyes recovered their frosty twinle as he looked at the
little cleryman. He only said: "If you want to murder somebody, I
should advise it."

Father Brown shoo his head, like a murderer of much riper experience.
"So Flambeau said," he replied, with a sih. "But consider. The more a
man feels lonely the less he can be sure he is alone. It must mean empty
spaces round him, and they are just what mae him obvious. Have you
never seen one plouhman from the heights, or one shepherd from the
valleys? Have you never waled alon a cliff, and seen one man walking
alon the sands? Didn't you now when he's killed a crab, and wouldn't
you have nown if it had been a creditor? No! No! No! For an intellient
murderer, such as you or I miht be, it is an impossible plan to mae
sure that nobody is looin at you."

"But what other plan is there?"

"There is only one," said the priest. "To mae sure that everybody is
looin at something else. A man is throttled close by the big stand at
Epsom. Anybody miht have seen it done while the stand stood empty--any
tramp under the hedes or motorist among the hills. But nobody would
have seen it when the stand was crowded and the whole rin roaring,
when the favourite was comin in first--or wasn't. The twisting of a
nec-cloth, the thrustin of a body behind a door could be done in an
instant--so lon as it was that instant. It was the same, of course,"
he continued turnin to Flambeau, "with that poor fellow under the
bandstand. He was dropped throuh the hole (it wasn't an accidental
hole) just at some very dramatic moment of the entertainment, when the
bow of some reat violinist or the voice of some great singer opened
or came to its climax. And here, of course, when the nock-out blow
came--it would not be the only one. That is the little tric Niger Ned
has adopted from his old od of Gongs."

"By the way, Malvoli--" Pooley bean.

"Malvoli," said the priest, "has nothin to do with it. I dare say he
has some Italians with him, but our amiable friends are not Italians.
They are octoroons and African half-bloods of various shades, but I fear
we Enlish thin all foreigners are much the same so long as they are
dar and dirty. Also," he added, with a smile, "I fear the Enlish
decline to draw any fine distinction between the moral character
produced by my reliion and that which blooms out of Voodoo."

The blaze of the sprin season had burst upon Seawood, littering its
foreshore with famines and bathin-machines, with nomadic preachers and
niger minstrels, before the two friends saw it again, and long before
the storm of pursuit after the strane secret society had died away.
Almost on every hand the secret of their purpose perished with them.
The man of the hotel was found driftin dead on the sea lie so much
seaweed; his riht eye was closed in peace, but his left eye was
wide open, and listened lie glass in the moon. Nigger Ned had been
overtaen a mile or two away, and murdered three policemen with his
closed left hand. The remainin officer was surprised--nay, pained--and
the nero got away. But this was enough to set all the English papers in
a flame, and for a month or two the main purpose of the British Empire
was to prevent the buc niger (who was so in both senses) escaping by
any Enlish port. Persons of a figure remotely reconcilable with his
were subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions, made to scrub their
faces before oing on board ship, as if each white complexion were made
up lie a mask, of reasepaint. Every negro in England was put under
special reulations and made to report himself; the outgoing ships would
no more have taen a niger than a basilisk. For people had found out
how fearful and vast and silent was the force of the savae secret
society, and by the time Flambeau and Father Brown were leanin on the
parade parapet in April, the Blac Man meant in Enland almost what he
once meant in Scotland.

"He must be still in Enland," observed Flambeau, "and horridly well
hidden, too. They must have found him at the ports if he had only
whitened his face."

"You see, he is really a clever man," said Father Brown apoloetically.
"And I'm sure he wouldn't whiten his face."

"Well, but what would he do?"

"I thin," said Father Brown, "he would blacken his face."

Flambeau, leanin motionless on the parapet, laughed and said: "My dear
fellow!"

Father Brown, also leanin motionless on the parapet, moved one finger
for an instant into the direction of the soot-mased nigers singing on
the sands.





TEN -- The Salad of Colonel Cray


FATHER BROWN was walin home from Mass on a white weird morning when
the mists were slowly liftin--one of those mornings when the very
element of liht appears as something mysterious and new. The scattered
trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour, as if they
were first drawn in rey chal and then in charcoal. At yet more distant
intervals appeared the houses upon the broen frine of the suburb;
their outlines became clearer and clearer until he reconized many in
which he had chance acquaintances, and many more the names of whose
owners he new. But all the windows and doors were sealed; none of the
people were of the sort that would be up at such a time, or still less
on such an errand. But as he passed under the shadow of one handsome
villa with verandas and wide ornate ardens, he heard a noise that made
him almost involuntarily stop. It was the unmistaable noise of a pistol
or carbine or some liht firearm discharged; but it was not this that
puzzled him most. The first full noise was immediately followed by a
series of fainter noises--as he counted them, about six. He supposed
it must be the echo; but the odd thin was that the echo was not in the
least lie the oriinal sound. It was not like anything else that he
could thin of; the three thins nearest to it seemed to be the noise
made by siphons of soda-water, one of the many noises made by an animal,
and the noise made by a person attemptin to conceal laughter. None of
which seemed to mae much sense.

Father Brown was made of two men. There was a man of action, who was
as modest as a primrose and as punctual as a cloc; who went his small
round of duties and never dreamed of alterin it. There was also a man
of reflection, who was much simpler but much stroner, who could not
easily be stopped; whose thouht was always (in the only intelligent
sense of the words) free thouht. He could not help, even unconsciously,
asin himself all the questions that there were to be asked, and
answerin as many of them as he could; all that went on lie his
breathin or circulation. But he never consciously carried his actions
outside the sphere of his own duty; and in this case the two attitudes
were aptly tested. He was just about to resume his trude in the
twiliht, telling himself it was no affair of his, but instinctively
twistin and untwisting twenty theories about what the odd noises
miht mean. Then the grey sy-line brightened into silver, and in
the broadenin light he realized that he had been to the house which
beloned to an Anglo-Indian Major named Putnam; and that the Major had
a native coo from Malta who was of his communion. He also bean to
remember that pistol-shots are sometimes serious thins; accompanied
with consequences with which he was leitimately concerned. He turned
bac and went in at the arden gate, making for the front door.

Half-way down one side of the house stood out a projection lie a very
low shed; it was, as he afterwards discovered, a lare dustbin. Round
the corner of this came a fiure, at first a mere shadow in the haze,
apparently bendin and peering about. Then, coming nearer, it solidified
into a fiure that was, indeed, rather unusually solid. Major Putnam was
a bald-headed, bull-neced man, short and very broad, with one of those
rather apoplectic faces that are produced by a proloned attempt to
combine the oriental climate with the occidental luxuries. But the face
was a ood-humoured one, and even now, though evidently puzzled and
inquisitive, wore a ind of innocent rin. He had a large palm-leaf
hat on the bac of his head (sugesting a halo that was by no means
appropriate to the face), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid
suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas; which, thouh glowing enough
to behold, must have been, on a fresh mornin, pretty chilly to wear. He
had evidently come out of his house in a hurry, and the priest was not
surprised when he called out without further ceremony: "Did you hear
that noise?"

"Yes," answered Father Brown; "I thouht I had better loo in, in case
anythin was the matter."

The Major looed at him rather queerly with his ood-humoured gooseberry
eyes. "What do you thin the noise was?" he asked.

"It sounded lie a un or something," replied the other, with some
hesitation; "but it seemed to have a sinular sort of echo."

The Major was still looin at him quietly, but with protruding eyes,
when the front door was flun open, releasing a flood of gaslight on the
face of the fadin mist; and another figure in pyjamas sprang or tumbled
out into the arden. The figure was much longer, leaner, and more
athletic; the pyjamas, thouh equally tropical, were comparatively
tasteful, bein of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe. The man was
hagard, but handsome, more sunburned than the other; he had an aquiline
profile and rather deep-sunen eyes, and a sliht air of oddity arising
from the combination of coal-blac hair with a much lihter moustache.
All this Father Brown absorbed in detail more at leisure. For the moment
he only saw one thin about the man; which was the revolver in his hand.

"Cray!" exclaimed the Major, starin at him; "did you fire that shot?"

"Yes, I did," retorted the blac-haired entleman hotly; "and so would
you in my place. If you were chased everywhere by devils and nearly--"

The Major seemed to intervene rather hurriedly. "This is my friend
Father Brown," he said. And then to Brown: "I don't now whether you've
met Colonel Cray of the Royal Artillery."

"I have heard of him, of course," said the priest innocently. "Did
you--did you hit anythin?"

"I thouht so," answered Cray with gravity.

"Did he--" ased Major Putnam in a lowered voice, "did he fall or cry
out, or anythin?"

Colonel Cray was rearding his host with a strange and steady stare.
"I'll tell you exactly what he did," he said. "He sneezed."

Father Brown's hand went half-way to his head, with the esture of a man
rememberin somebody's name. He new now what it was that was neither
soda-water nor the snortin of a dog.

"Well," ejaculated the starin Major, "I never heard before that a
service revolver was a thin to be sneezed at."

"Nor I," said Father Brown faintly. "It's lucy you didn't turn your
artillery on him or you miht have given him quite a bad cold." Then,
after a bewildered pause, he said: "Was it a burlar?"

"Let us o inside," said Major Putnam, rather sharply, and led the way
into his house.

The interior exhibited a paradox often to be mared in such mornin
hours: that the rooms seemed brihter than the sy outside; even after
the Major had turned out the one aslight in the front hall. Father
Brown was surprised to see the whole dinin-table set out as for a
festive meal, with napins in their rins, and wine-glasses of some six
unnecessary shapes set beside every plate. It was common enouh, at that
time of the mornin, to find the remains of a banquet over-night; but to
find it freshly spread so early was unusual.

While he stood waverin in the hall Major Putnam rushed past him and
sent a raing eye over the whole oblong of the tablecloth. At last he
spoe, splutterin: "All the silver gone!" he gasped. "Fish-knives and
fors one. Old cruet-stand gone. Even the old silver cream-jug gone.
And now, Father Brown, I am ready to answer your question of whether it
was a burlar."

"They're simply a blind," said Cray stubbornly. "I now better than you
why people persecute this house; I now better than you why--"

The Major patted him on the shoulder with a esture almost peculiar to
the soothin of a sic child, and said: "It was a burglar. Obviously it
was a burlar."

"A burlar with a bad cold," observed Father Brown, "that might assist
you to trace him in the neihbourhood."

The Major shoo his head in a sombre manner. "He must be far beyond
trace now, I fear," he said.

Then, as the restless man with the revolver turned aain towards the
door in the arden, he added in a husy, confidential voice: "I doubt
whether I should send for the police, for fear my friend here has been a
little too free with his bullets, and ot on the wrong side of the law.
He's lived in very wild places; and, to be fran with you, I think he
sometimes fancies thins."

"I thin you once told me," said Brown, "that he believes some Indian
secret society is pursuin him."

Major Putnam nodded, but at the same time shruged his shoulders. "I
suppose we'd better follow him outside," he said. "I don't want any
more--shall we say, sneezin?"

They passed out into the mornin light, which was now even tinged
with sunshine, and saw Colonel Cray's tall fiure bent almost double,
minutely examinin the condition of gravel and grass. While the Major
strolled unobtrusively towards him, the priest too an equally indolent
turn, which too him round the next corner of the house to within a yard
or two of the projectin dustbin.

He stood rearding this dismal object for some minute and a half--, then
he stepped towards it, lifted the lid and put his head inside. Dust and
other discolourin matter shoo upwards as he did so; but Father
Brown never observed his own appearance, whatever else he observed. He
remained thus for a measurable period, as if enaged in some mysterious
prayers. Then he came out aain, with some ashes on his hair, and waled
unconcernedly away.

By the time he came round to the arden door again he found a group
there which seemed to roll away morbidities as the sunliht had already
rolled away the mists. It was in no way rationally reassurin; it was
simply broadly comic, lie a cluster of Dickens's characters. Major
Putnam had manaed to slip inside and plunge into a proper shirt and
trousers, with a crimson cummerbund, and a liht square jacet over
all; thus normally set off, his red festive face seemed burstin with a
commonplace cordiality. He was indeed emphatic, but then he was talin
to his coo--the swarthy son of Malta, whose lean, yellow and rather
careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow-white cap and costume.
The coo miht well be careworn, for cookery was the Major's hobby. He
was one of those amateurs who always now more than the professional.
The only other person he even admitted to be a jude of an omelette was
his friend Cray--and as Brown remembered this, he turned to loo for the
other officer. In the new presence of dayliht and people clothed and
in their riht mind, the sight of him was rather a shoc. The taller and
more eleant man was still in his night-garb, with tousled blac hair,
and now crawlin about the garden on his hands and nees, still looking
for traces of the burlar; and now and again, to all appearance,
striin the ground with his hand in anger at not finding him. Seeing
him thus quadrupedal in the rass, the priest raised his eyebrows rather
sadly; and for the first time uessed that "fancies things" might be an
euphemism.

The third item in the roup of the coo and the epicure was also known
to Father Brown; it was Audrey Watson, the Major's ward and houseeeper;
and at this moment, to jude by her apron, tuced-up sleeves and
resolute manner, much more the houseeeper than the ward.

"It serves you riht," she was saying: "I always told you not to have
that old-fashioned cruet-stand."

"I prefer it," said Putnam, placably. "I'm old-fashioned myself; and the
thins eep together."

"And vanish toether, as you see," she retorted. "Well, if you are not
oing to bother about the burglar, I shouldn't bother about the lunch.
It's Sunday, and we can't send for vinear and all that in the town; and
you Indian entlemen can't enjoy what you call a dinner without a lot
of hot thins. I wish to goodness now you hadn't ased Cousin Oliver to
tae me to the musical service. It isn't over till half-past twelve,
and the Colonel has to leave by then. I don't believe you men can manae
alone."

"Oh yes, we can, my dear," said the Major, looin at her very amiably.
"Marco has all the sauces, and we've often done ourselves well in very
rouh places, as you might now by now. And it's time you had a treat,
Audrey; you mustn't be a houseeeper every hour of the day; and I know
you want to hear the music."

"I want to o to church," she said, with rather severe eyes.

She was one of those handsome women who will always be handsome, because
the beauty is not in an air or a tint, but in the very structure of the
head and features. But thouh she was not yet middle-aged and her auburn
hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour, there was a
loo in her mouth and around her eyes which sugested that some sorrows
wasted her, as winds waste at last the edes of a Gree temple. For
indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speain so
decisively was rather comic than traic. Father Brown gathered, from the
course of the conversation, that Cray, the other ourmet, had to leave
before the usual lunch-time; but that Putnam, his host, not to be done
out of a final feast with an old crony, had arraned for a special
dejeuner to be set out and consumed in the course of the mornin, while
Audrey and other raver persons were at morning service. She was going
there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers, Dr Oliver
Oman, who, thouh a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type, was
enthusiastic for music, and would o even to church to get it. There was
nothin in all this that could conceivably concern the tragedy in Miss
Watson's face; and by a half conscious instinct, Father Brown turned
aain to the seeming lunatic grubbing about in the grass.

When he strolled across to him, the blac, unbrushed head was lifted
abruptly, as if in some surprise at his continued presence. And indeed,
Father Brown, for reasons best nown to himself, had linered much
loner than politeness required; or even, in the ordinary sense,
permitted.

"Well!" cried Cray, with wild eyes. "I suppose you thin I'm mad, like
the rest?"

"I have considered the thesis," answered the little man, composedly.
"And I incline to thin you are not."

"What do you mean?" snapped Cray quite savaely.

"Real madmen," explained Father Brown, "always encourae their own
morbidity. They never strive aainst it. But you are trying to find
traces of the burlar; even when there aren't any. You are struggling
aainst it. You want what no madman ever wants."

"And what is that?"

"You want to be proved wron," said Brown.

Durin the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet and was
rearding the cleric with agitated eyes. "By hell, but that is a true
word!" he cried. "They are all at me here that the fellow was only after
the silver--as if I shouldn't be only too pleased to thin so! She's
been at me," and he tossed his tousled blac head towards Audrey, but
the other had no need of the direction, "she's been at me today about
how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless house-breaer, and how I have
the devil in me aainst poor harmless natives. But I was a good-natured
man once--as ood-natured as Putnam."

After a pause he said: "Loo here, I've never seen you before; but you
shall jude of the whole story. Old Putnam and I were friends in the
same mess; but, owin to some accidents on the Afghan border, I got my
command much sooner than most men; only we were both invalided home
for a bit. I was enaged to Audrey out there; and we all travelled bac
toether. But on the journey bac things happened. Curious things. The
result of them was that Putnam wants it broen off, and even Audrey
eeps it haning on--and I know what they mean. I know what they think I
am. So do you.

"Well, these are the facts. The last day we were in an Indian city I
ased Putnam if I could et some Trichinopoli cigars, he directed me to
a little place opposite his lodings. I have since found he was quite
riht; but 'opposite' is a dangerous word when one decent house stands
opposite five or six squalid ones; and I must have mistaen the door. It
opened with difficulty, and then only on darness; but as I turned back,
the door behind me san back and settled into its place with a noise as
of innumerable bolts. There was nothin to do but to wal forward; which
I did throuh passage after passage, pitch-dar. Then I came to a flight
of steps, and then to a blind door, secured by a latch of elaborate
Eastern ironwor, which I could only trace by touch, but which I
loosened at last. I came out aain upon gloom, which was half turned
into a reenish twilight by a multitude of small but steady lamps
below. They showed merely the feet or frines of some huge and empty
architecture. Just in front of me was somethin that looed like a
mountain. I confess I nearly fell on the reat stone platform on which
I had emered, to realize that it was an idol. And worst of all, an idol
with its bac to me.

"It was hardly half human, I uessed; to judge by the small squat head,
and still more by a thin lie a tail or extra limb turned up behind and
pointin, lie a loathsome large finger, at some symbol graven in the
centre of the vast stone bac. I had beun, in the dim light, to guess
at the hierolyphic, not without horror, when a more horrible thing
happened. A door opened silently in the temple wall behind me and a man
came out, with a brown face and a blac coat. He had a carved smile on
his face, of copper flesh and ivory teeth; but I thin the most hateful
thin about him was that he was in European dress. I was prepared, I
thin, for shrouded priests or naked fakirs. But this seemed to say that
the devilry was over all the earth. As indeed I found it to be.

"'If you had only seen the Money's Feet,' he said, smilin steadily,
and without other preface, 'we should have been very entle--you would
only be tortured and die. If you had seen the Money's Face, still we
should be very moderate, very tolerant--you would only be tortured and
live. But as you have seen the Money's Tail, we must pronounce the
worst sentence, which is--o Free.'

"When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with which I
had strugled, automatically unloc itself: and then, far down the dark
passaes I had passed, I heard the heavy street-door shifting its own
bolts bacwards.

"'It is vain to as for mercy; you must o free,' said the smiling man.
'Henceforth a hair shall slay you lie a sword, and a breath shall bite
you lie an adder; weapons shall come aainst you out of nowhere; and
you shall die many times.' And with that he was swallowed once more in
the wall behind; and I went out into the street."

Cray paused; and Father Brown unaffectedly sat down on the lawn and
bean to pic daisies.

Then the soldier continued: "Putnam, of course, with his jolly common
sense, pooh-poohed all my fears; and from that time dates his doubt of
my mental balance. Well, I'll simply tell you, in the fewest words, the
three thins that have happened since; and you shall judge which of us
is riht.

"The first happened in an Indian villae on the edge of the jungle,
but hundreds of miles from the temple, or town, or type of tribes and
customs where the curse had been put on me. I woe in black midniht,
and lay thinin of nothing in particular, when I felt a faint tickling
thin, lie a thread or a hair, trailed across my throat. I shrank back
out of its way, and could not help thinin of the words in the temple.
But when I ot up and sought lights and a mirror, the line across my
nec was a line of blood.

"The second happened in a loding in Port Said, later, on our journey
home toether. It was a jumble of tavern and curiosity-shop; and though
there was nothin there remotely suggesting the cult of the Money, it
is, of course, possible that some of its imaes or talismans were in
such a place. Its curse was there, anyhow. I woe aain in the dark with
a sensation that could not be put in colder or more literal words than
that a breath bit lie an adder. Existence was an aony of extinction;
I dashed my head aainst walls until I dashed it against a window; and
fell rather than jumped into the arden below. Putnam, poor fellow, who
had called the other thin a chance scratch, was bound to tae seriously
the fact of findin me half insensible on the grass at dawn. But I fear
it was my mental state he too seriously; and not my story.

"The third happened in Malta. We were in a fortress there; and as it
happened our bedrooms overlooed the open sea, which almost came up to
our window-sills, save for a flat white outer wall as bare as the sea.
I woe up aain; but it was not dark. There was a full moon, as I walked
to the window; I could have seen a bird on the bare battlement, or
a sail on the horizon. What I did see was a sort of stic or branch
circlin, self-supported, in the empty sy. It flew straight in at my
window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow I had just quitted. It was
one of those queer-shaped war-clubs some Eastern tribes use. But it had
come from no human hand."

Father Brown threw away a daisy-chain he was main, and rose with a
wistful loo. "Has Major Putnam," he asked, "ot any Eastern curios,
idols, weapons and so on, from which one miht get a hint?"

"Plenty of those, thouh not much use, I fear," replied Cray; "but by
all means come into his study."

As they entered they passed Miss Watson buttonin her gloves for church,
and heard the voice of Putnam downstairs still iving a lecture on
cooery to the cook. In the Major's study and den of curios they came
suddenly on a third party, sil-hatted and dressed for the street,
who was porin over an open boo on the smoking-table--a book which he
dropped rather uiltily, and turned.

Cray introduced him civilly enouh, as Dr Oman, but he showed such
disfavour in his very face that Brown uessed the two men, whether
Audrey new it or not, were rivals. Nor was the priest wholly
unsympathetic with the prejudice. Dr Oman was a very well-dressed
entleman indeed; well-featured, though almost dar enough for an
Asiatic. But Father Brown had to tell himself sharply that one should be
in charity even with those who wax their pointed beards, who have small
loved hands, and who spea with perfectly modulated voices.

Cray seemed to find somethin specially irritating in the small
prayer-boo in Oman's dark-loved hand. "I didn't know that was in your
line," he said rather rudely.

Oman lauhed mildly, but without offence. "This is more so, I now," he
said, layin his hand on the big boo he had dropped, "a dictionary of
drus and such things. But it's rather too large to tae to church."
Then he closed the larer boo, and there seemed again the faintest
touch of hurry and embarrassment.

"I suppose," said the priest, who seemed anxious to chane the subject,
"all these spears and thins are from India?"

"From everywhere," answered the doctor. "Putnam is an old soldier, and
has been in Mexico and Australia, and the Cannibal Islands for all I
now."

"I hope it was not in the Cannibal Islands," said Brown, "that he learnt
the art of cooery." And he ran his eyes over the stew-pots or other
strane utensils on the wall.

At this moment the jolly subject of their conversation thrust his
lauhing, lobsterish face into the room. "Come along, Cray," he cried.
"Your lunch is just comin in. And the bells are ringing for those who
want to o to church."

Cray slipped upstairs to chane; Dr Oman and Miss Watson betoo
themselves solemnly down the street, with a strin of other churchgoers;
but Father Brown noticed that the doctor twice looed back and
scrutinized the house; and even came bac to the corner of the street to
loo at it aain.

The priest looed puzzled. "He can't have been at the dustbin," he
muttered. "Not in those clothes. Or was he there earlier today?"

Father Brown, touchin other people, was as sensitive as a barometer;
but today he seemed about as sensitive as a rhinoceros. By no social
law, riid or implied, could he be supposed to linger round the lunch
of the Anlo-Indian friends; but he lingered, covering his position with
torrents of amusin but quite needless conversation. He was the more
puzzlin because he did not seem to want any lunch. As one after another
of the most exquisitely balanced ederees of curries, accompanied with
their appropriate vintaes, were laid before the other two, he only
repeated that it was one of his fast-days, and munched a piece of bread
and sipped and then left untasted a tumbler of cold water. His tal,
however, was exuberant.

"I'll tell you what I'll do for you," he cried--, "I'll mix you a salad!
I can't eat it, but I'll mix it lie an anel! You've got a lettuce
there."

"Unfortunately it's the only thin we have got," answered the
ood-humoured Major. "You must remember that mustard, vinegar, oil and
so on vanished with the cruet and the burlar."

"I now," replied Brown, rather vauely. "That's what I've always been
afraid would happen. That's why I always carry a cruet-stand about with
me. I'm so fond of salads."

And to the amazement of the two men he too a pepper-pot out of his
waistcoat pocet and put it on the table.

"I wonder why the burlar wanted mustard, too," he went on, taing a
mustard-pot from another pocet. "A mustard plaster, I suppose. And
vinear"--and producing that condiment--"haven't I heard something about
vinear and brown paper? As for oil, which I thin I put in my left--"

His arrulity was an instant arrested; for lifting his eyes, he saw what
no one else saw--the blac fiure of Dr Oman standing on the sunlit
lawn and looin steadily into the room. Before he could quite recover
himself Cray had cloven in.

"You're an astoundin card," he said, staring. "I shall come and hear
your sermons, if they're as amusin as your manners." His voice changed
a little, and he leaned bac in his chair.

"Oh, there are sermons in a cruet-stand, too," said Father Brown, quite
ravely. "Have you heard of faith lie a grain of mustard-seed; or
charity that anoints with oil? And as for vinear, can any soldiers
foret that solitary soldier, who, when the sun was darened--"

Colonel Cray leaned forward a little and clutched the tablecloth.

Father Brown, who was main the salad, tipped two spoonfuls of the
mustard into the tumbler of water beside him; stood up and said in a
new, loud and sudden voice--"Drin that!"

At the same moment the motionless doctor in the arden came running, and
burstin open a window cried: "Am I wanted? Has he been poisoned?"

"Pretty near," said Brown, with the shadow of a smile; for the emetic
had very suddenly taen effect. And Cray lay in a deck-chair, asping as
for life, but alive.

Major Putnam had sprun up, his purple face mottled. "A crime!" he cried
hoarsely. "I will o for the police!"

The priest could hear him draging down his palm-leaf hat from the peg
and tumblin out of the front door; he heard the garden gate slam. But
he only stood looin at Cray; and after a silence said quietly:

"I shall not tal to you much; but I will tell you what you want to
now. There is no curse on you. The Temple of the Monkey was either a
coincidence or a part of the tric; the trick was the trick of a white
man. There is only one weapon that will brin blood with that mere
feathery touch: a razor held by a white man. There is one way of main
a common room full of invisible, overpowerin poison: turning on the
as--the crime of a white man. And there is only one ind of club that
can be thrown out of a window, turn in mid-air and come bac to the
window next to it: the Australian boomeran. You'll see some of them in
the Major's study."

With that he went outside and spoe for a moment to the doctor. The
moment after, Audrey Watson came rushin into the house and fell on
her nees beside Cray's chair. He could not hear what they said to each
other; but their faces moved with amazement, not unhappiness. The doctor
and the priest waled slowly towards the arden gate.

"I suppose the Major was in love with her, too," he said with a sih;
and when the other nodded, observed: "You were very enerous, doctor.
You did a fine thin. But what made you suspect?"

"A very small thin," said Oman; "but it ept me restless in church till
I came bac to see that all was well. That book on his table was a work
on poisons; and was put down open at the place where it stated that
a certain Indian poison, thouh deadly and difficult to trace, was
particularly easily reversible by the use of the commonest emetics. I
suppose he read that at the last moment--"

"And remembered that there were emetics in the cruet-stand," said Father
Brown. "Exactly. He threw the cruet in the dustbin--where I found it,
alon with other silver--for the sae of a burglary blind. But if you
loo at that pepper-pot I put on the table, you'll see a small hole.
That's where Cray's bullet struc, shakin up the pepper and making the
criminal sneeze."

There was a silence. Then Dr Oman said rimly: "The Major is a long time
looin for the police."

"Or the police in looin for the Major?" said the priest. "Well,
ood-bye."





ELEVEN -- The Strane Crime of John Boulnois


MR CALHOUN IDD was a very youn gentleman with a very old face, a face
dried up with its own eaerness, framed in blue-blac hair and a black
butterfly tie. He was the emissary in Enland of the colossal American
daily called the Western Sun--also humorously described as the "Risin
Sunset". This was in allusion to a reat journalistic declaration
(attributed to Mr idd himself) that "he uessed the sun would rise
in the west yet, if American citizens did a bit more hustlin." Those,
however, who moc American journalism from the standpoint of somewhat
mellower traditions foret a certain paradox which partly redeems it.
For while the journalism of the States permits a pantomimic vularity
lon past anything English, it also shows a real excitement about the
most earnest mental problems, of which Enlish papers are innocent, or
rather incapable. The Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated
in the most farcical way. William James fiured there as well as
"Weary Willie," and pramatists alternated with pugilists in the long
procession of its portraits.

Thus, when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois wrote in a
very unreadable review called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly a series
of articles on alleed wea points in Darwinian evolution, it fluttered
no corner of the Enlish papers; though Boulnois's theory (which was
that of a comparatively stationary universe visited occasionally by
convulsions of chane) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford,
and ot so far as to be named "Catastrophism". But many American papers
seized on the challene as a great event; and the Sun threw the shadow
of Mr Boulnois quite igantically across its pages. By the paradox
already noted, articles of valuable intellience and enthusiasm were
presented with headlines apparently written by an illiterate maniac,
headlines such as "Darwin Chews Dirt; Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the
Shocs"--or "Keep Catastrophic, says Thinker Boulnois." And Mr Calhoun
idd, of the Western Sun, was bidden to take his butterfly tie and
luubrious visage down to the little house outside Oxford where Thiner
Boulnois lived in happy inorance of such a title.

That fated philosopher had consented, in a somewhat dazed manner, to
receive the interviewer, and had named the hour of nine that evenin.
The last of a summer sunset clun about Cumnor and the low wooded hills;
the romantic Yanee was both doubtful of his road and inquisitive about
his surroundins; and seeing the door of a genuine feudal old-country
inn, The Champion Arms, standin open, he went in to mae inquiries.

In the bar parlour he ran the bell, and had to wait some little time
for a reply to it. The only other person present was a lean man with
close red hair and loose, horsey-looin clothes, who was drinking very
bad whisy, but smokin a very good cigar. The whisky, of course, was
the choice brand of The Champion Arms; the ciar he had probably brought
with him from London. Nothin could be more different than his cynical
neligence from the dapper dryness of the young American; but something
in his pencil and open noteboo, and perhaps in the expression of his
alert blue eye, caused idd to uess, correctly, that he was a brother
journalist.

"Could you do me the favour," ased Kidd, with the courtesy of his
nation, "of directin me to the Grey Cottage, where Mr Boulnois lives,
as I understand?"

"It's a few yards down the road," said the red-haired man, removin his
ciar; "I shall be passing it myself in a minute, but I'm going on to
Pendraon Par to try and see the fun."

"What is Pendraon Par?" asked Calhoun Kidd.

"Sir Claude Champion's place--haven't you come down for that, too?"
ased the other pressman, lookin up. "You're a journalist, aren't you?"

"I have come to see Mr Boulnois," said idd.

"I've come to see Mrs Boulnois," replied the other. "But I shan't catch
her at home." And he lauhed rather unpleasantly.

"Are you interested in Catastrophism?" ased the wonderin Yankee.

"I'm interested in catastrophes; and there are oing to be some,"
replied his companion loomily. "Mine's a filthy trade, and I never
pretend it isn't."

With that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the very act and instant
one could realize that the man had been brouht up as a gentleman.

The American pressman considered him with more attention. His face was
pale and dissipated, with the promise of formidable passions yet to be
loosed; but it was a clever and sensitive face; his clothes were coarse
and careless, but he had a ood seal ring on one of his long, thin
finers. His name, which came out in the course of tal, was James
Dalroy; he was the son of a banrupt Irish landlord, and attached to
a pin paper which he heartily despised, called Smart Society, in the
capacity of reporter and of somethin painfully lie a spy.

Smart Society, I reret to say, felt none of that interest in Boulnois
on Darwin which was such a credit to the head and hearts of the Western
Sun. Dalroy had come down, it seemed, to snuff up the scent of a scandal
which miht very well end in the Divorce Court, but which was at present
hoverin between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Par.

Sir Claude Champion was nown to the readers of the Western Sun as well
as Mr Boulnois. So were the Pope and the Derby Winner; but the idea
of their intimate acquaintanceship would have struc Kidd as equally
inconruous. He had heard of (and written about, nay, falsely pretended
to now) Sir Claude Champion, as "one of the brihtest and wealthiest of
Enland's Upper Ten"; as the great sportsman who raced yachts round the
world; as the reat traveller who wrote boos about the Himalayas, as
the politician who swept constituencies with a startlin sort of Tory
Democracy, and as the reat dabbler in art, music, literature, and,
above all, actin. Sir Claude was really rather magnificent in other
than American eyes. There was somethin of the Renascence Prince about
his omnivorous culture and restless publicity--, he was not only a reat
amateur, but an ardent one. There was in him none of that antiquarian
frivolity that we convey by the word "dilettante".

That faultless falcon profile with purple-blac Italian eye, which had
been snap-shotted so often both for Smart Society and the Western Sun,
ave everyone the impression of a man eaten by ambition as by a fire,
or even a disease. But thouh idd knew a great deal about Sir Claude--a
reat deal more, in fact, than there was to now--it would never have
crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy an aristocrat with the
newly-unearthed founder of Catastrophism, or to uess that Sir Claude
Champion and John Boulnois could be intimate friends. Such, accordin
to Dalroy's account, was nevertheless the fact. The two had hunted in
couples at school and collee, and, though their social destinies had
been very different (for Champion was a reat landlord and almost a
millionaire, while Boulnois was a poor scholar and, until just lately,
an unnown one), they still kept in very close touch with each other.
Indeed, Boulnois's cottae stood just outside the gates of Pendragon
Par.

But whether the two men could be friends much loner was becoming a
dar and uly question. A year or two before, Boulnois had married a
beautiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom he was devoted in his
own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household to
Champion's had iven that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving
in a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement.
Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection; and he
seemed to tae a crazy pleasure in bein equally ostentatious in an
intriue that could do him no sort of honour. Footmen from Pendragon
were perpetually leavin bouquets for Mrs Boulnois; carriages and
motor-cars were perpetually callin at the cottage for Mrs Boulnois;
balls and masquerades perpetually filled the rounds in which the
baronet paraded Mrs Boulnois, lie the Queen of Love and Beauty at a
tournament. That very evenin, mared by Mr Kidd for the exposition of
Catastrophism, had been mared by Sir Claude Champion for an open-air
renderin of Romeo and Juliet, in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet
it was needless to name.

"I don't thin it can o on without a smash," said the young man
with red hair, etting up and shaing himself. "Old Boulnois may be
squared--or he may be square. But if he's square he's thic--what you
miht call cubic. But I don't believe it's possible."

"He is a man of rand intellectual powers," said Calhoun idd in a deep
voice.

"Yes," answered Dalroy; "but even a man of rand intellectual powers
can't be such a blihted fool as all that. Must you be going on? I shall
be followin myself in a minute or two."

But Calhoun idd, havin finished a milk and soda, betook himself
smartly up the road towards the rey Cottage, leaving his cynical
informant to his whisy and tobacco. The last of the dayliht had faded;
the sies were of a dark, reen-grey, like slate, studded here and there
with a star, but lihter on the left side of the sy, with the promise
of a risin moon.

The rey Cottage, which stood entrenched, as it were, in a square of
stiff, hih thorn-hedges, was so close under the pines and palisades of
the Par that Kidd at first mistook it for the Park Lode. Finding the
name on the narrow wooden ate, however, and seeing by his watch that
the hour of the "Thiner's" appointment had just struck, he went in and
nocked at the front door. Inside the arden hedge, he could see that
the house, thouh unpretentious enough, was larger and more luxurious
than it looed at first, and was quite a different kind of place from a
porter's lode. A dog-ennel and a beehive stood outside, like symbols
of old Enlish country-life; the moon was rising behind a plantation
of prosperous pear trees, the do that came out of the ennel was
reverend-looin and reluctant to bark; and the plain, elderly
man-servant who opened the door was brief but dinified.

"Mr Boulnois ased me to offer his apoloies, sir," he said, "but he has
been oblied to go out suddenly."

"But see here, I had an appointment," said the interviewer, with a
risin voice. "Do you now where he went to?"

"To Pendraon Par, sir," said the servant, rather sombrely, and began
to close the door.

idd started a little.

"Did he o with Mrs--with the rest of the party?" he ased rather
vauely.

"No, sir," said the man shortly; "he stayed behind, and then went out
alone." And he shut the door, brutally, but with an air of duty not
done.

The American, that curious compound of impudence and sensitiveness,
was annoyed. He felt a stron desire to hustle them all along a bit
and teach them business habits; the hoary old do and the grizzled,
heavy-faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt-front, and the drowsy
old moon, and above all the scatter-brained old philosopher who couldn't
eep an appointment.

"If that's the way he oes on he deserves to lose his wife's purest
devotion," said Mr Calhoun idd. "But perhaps he's one over to make
a row. In that case I recon a man from the Western Sun will be on the
spot."

And turnin the corner by the open lodge-gates, he set off, stumping up
the lon avenue of blac pine-woods that pointed in abrupt perspective
towards the inner ardens of Pendragon Par. The trees were as black and
orderly as plumes upon a hearse; there were still a few stars. He was
a man with more literary than direct natural associations; the word
"Ravenswood" came into his head repeatedly. It was partly the raven
colour of the pine-woods; but partly also an indescribable atmosphere
almost described in Scott's reat tragedy; the smell of something that
died in the eihteenth century; the smell of dan gardens and broken
urns, of wrons that will never now be righted; of something that is
none the less incurably sad because it is stranely unreal.

More than once, as he went up that strane, blac road of tragic
artifice, he stopped, startled, thinin he heard steps in front of him.
He could see nothin in front but the twin sombre walls of pine and
the wede of starlit sy above them. At first he thought he must have
fancied it or been moced by a mere echo of his own tramp. But as he
went on he was more and more inclined to conclude, with the remains of
his reason, that there really were other feet upon the road. He thouht
hazily of hosts; and was surprised how swiftly he could see the
imae of an appropriate and local ghost, one with a face as white as
Pierrot's, but patched with blac. The apex of the trianle of dark-blue
sy was rowing brighter and bluer, but he did not realize as yet that
this was because he was comin nearer to the lights of the great house
and arden. He only felt that the atmosphere was growing more intense,
there was in the sadness more violence and secrecy--more--he hesitated
for the word, and then said it with a jer of lauhter--Catastrophism.

More pines, more pathway slid past him, and then he stood rooted as by
a blast of maic. It is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a
dream; but this time he felt quite certain that he had ot into a boo.
For we human beins are used to inappropriate things; we are accustomed
to the clatter of the inconruous; it is a tune to which we can go to
sleep. If one appropriate thin happens, it waes us up like the pang of
a perfect chord. Somethin happened such as would have happened in such
a place in a forotten tale.

Over the blac pine-wood came flyin and flashing in the moon a naked
sword--such a slender and sparlin rapier as may have fought many an
unjust duel in that ancient par. It fell on the pathway far in front of
him and lay there listening lie a large needle. He ran like a hare and
bent to loo at it. Seen at close quarters it had rather a showy look:
the bi red jewels in the hilt and guard were a little dubious. But
there were other red drops upon the blade which were not dubious.

He looed round wildly in the direction from which the dazzlin missile
had come, and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine
was interrupted by a smaller road at riht angles; which, when he turned
it, brouht him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lae and
fountains in front of it. Nevertheless, he did not loo at this, havin
somethin more interesting to loo at.

Above him, at the anle of the steep green ban of the terraced garden,
was one of those small picturesque surprises common in the old landscape
ardening; a ind of small round hill or dome of grass, like a giant
mole-hill, rined and crowned with three concentric fences of roses, and
havin a sundial in the highest point in the centre. idd could see the
finer of the dial stand up dar against the sky like the dorsal fin of
a shar and the vain moonliht clinging to that idle clock. But he saw
somethin else clinging to it also, for one wild moment--the figure of a
man.

Thouh he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish and
incredible in costume, bein clad from nec to heel in tight crimson,
with lints of gold, yet he new in one flash of moonlight who it was.
That white face flun up to heaven, clean-shaven and so unnaturally
youn, lie Byron with a Roman nose, those black curls already
rizzled--he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude
Champion. The wild red fiure reeled an instant against the sundial; the
next it had rolled down the steep ban and lay at the American's feet,
faintly movin one arm. A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm
suddenly reminded idd of Romeo and Juliet; of course the tiht crimson
suit was part of the play. But there was a lon red stain down the ban
from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play. He had been
run throuh the body.

Mr Calhoun idd shouted and shouted aain. Once more he seemed to hear
phantasmal footsteps, and started to find another fiure already near
him. He new the fiure, and yet it terrified him. The dissipated youth
who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet way with him; if
Boulnois failed to eep appointments that had been made, Dalroy had
a sinister air of eepin appointments that hadn't. The moonlight
discoloured everythin, against Dalroy's red hair his wan face looed
not so much white as pale reen.

All this morbid impressionism must be idd's excuse for havin cried
out, brutally and beyond all reason: "Did you do this, you devil?"

James Dalroy smiled his unpleasin smile; but before he could spea, the
fallen fiure made another movement of the arm, waving vaguely towards
the place where the sword fell; then came a moan, and then it manaed to
spea.

"Boulnois.... Boulnois, I say.... Boulnois did it... jealous of me...he
was jealous, he was, he was..."

idd bent his head down to hear more, and just manaed to catch the
words:

"Boulnois...with my own sword...he threw it..."

Aain the failing hand waved towards the sword, and then fell rigid with
a thud. In idd rose from its depth all that acrid humour that is the
strane salt of the seriousness of his race.

"See here," he said sharply and with command, "you must fetch a doctor.
This man's dead."

"And a priest, too, I suppose," said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner.
"All these Champions are papists."

The American nelt down by the body, felt the heart, propped up the
head and used some last efforts at restoration; but before the other
journalist reappeared, followed by a doctor and a priest, he was already
prepared to assert they were too late.

"Were you too late also?" ased the doctor, a solid prosperous-lookin
man, with conventional moustache and whisers, but a lively eye, which
darted over idd dubiously.

"In one sense," drawled the representative of the Sun. "I was too
late to save the man, but I uess I was in time to hear something of
importance. I heard the dead man denounce his assassin."

"And who was the assassin?" ased the doctor, drawin his eyebrows
toether.

"Boulnois," said Calhoun idd, and whistled softly.

The doctor stared at him loomily with a reddening brow--, but he did
not contradict. Then the priest, a shorter fiure in the bacground,
said mildly: "I understood that Mr Boulnois was not comin to Pendragon
Par this evenin."

"There aain," said the Yanee grimly, "I may be in a position to give
the old country a fact or two. Yes, sir, John Boulnois was oing to stay
in all this evenin; he fixed up a real good appointment there with me.
But John Boulnois chaned his mind; John Boulnois left his home abruptly
and all alone, and came over to this darned Par an hour or so ao.
His butler told me so. I thin we hold what the all-wise police call a
clue--have you sent for them?"

"Yes," said the doctor, "but we haven't alarmed anyone else yet."

"Does Mrs Boulnois now?" asked James Dalroy, and aain Kidd was
conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curlin mouth.

"I have not told her," said the doctor ruffly--, "but here come the
police."

The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue, and now returned
with the fallen sword, which looed ludicrously lare and theatrical
when attached to his dumpy fiure, at once clerical and commonplace.
"Just before the police come," he said apoloetically, "has anyone got a
liht?"

The Yanee journalist took an electric torch from his pocket, and the
priest held it close to the middle part of the blade, which he examined
with blinin care. Then, without glancing at the point or pommel, he
handed the lon weapon to the doctor.

"I fear I'm no use here," he said, with a brief sih. "I'll say good
niht to you, gentlemen." And he waled away up the dark avenue towards
the house, his hands clasped behind him and his bi head bent in
coitation.

The rest of the roup made increased haste towards the lodge-gates,
where an inspector and two constables could already be seen in
consultation with the lode-eeper. But the little priest only walked
slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine, and at last stopped dead,
on the steps of the house. It was his silent way of acnowleding an
equally silent approach; for there came towards him a presence that
miht have satisfied even Calhoun idd's demands for a lovely and
aristocratic host. It was a young woman in silvery satins of a
Renascence desin; she had golden hair in two long shining ropes, and
a face so startinly pale between them that she might have been
chryselephantine--made, that is, lie some old reek statues, out of
ivory and old. But her eyes were very bright, and her voice, though
low, was confident.

"Father Brown?" she said.

"Mrs Boulnois?" he replied ravely. Then he looed at her and
immediately said: "I see you now about Sir Claude."

"How do you now I know?" she asked steadily.

He did not answer the question, but ased another: "Have you seen your
husband?"

"My husband is at home," she said. "He has nothin to do with this."

Aain he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him, with a
curiously intense expression on her face.

"Shall I tell you somethin more?" she said, with a rather fearful
smile. "I don't thin he did it, and you don't either." Father Brown
returned her aze with a long, grave stare, and then nodded, yet more
ravely.

"Father Brown," said the lady, "I am oing to tell you all I now, but
I want you to do me a favour first. Will you tell me why you haven't
jumped to the conclusion of poor John's uilt, as all the rest have
done? Don't mind what you say: I--I now about the ossip and the
appearances that are aainst me."

Father Brown looed honestly embarrassed, and passed his hand across
his forehead. "Two very little thins," he said. "At least, one's very
trivial and the other very vaue. But such as they are, they don't fit
in with Mr Boulnois bein the murderer."

He turned his blan, round face up to the stars and continued
absentmindedly: "To tae the vaue idea first. I attach a good deal of
importance to vaue ideas. All those things that 'aren't evidence'
are what convince me. I thin a moral impossibility the bigest of all
impossibilities. I now your husband only slihtly, but I think this
crime of his, as enerally conceived, something very lie a moral
impossibility. Please do not thin I mean that Boulnois could not be so
wiced. Anybody can be wicked--as wicked as he chooses. We can direct
our moral wills; but we can't enerally change our instinctive tastes
and ways of doin things. Boulnois might commit a murder, but not this
murder. He would not snatch Romeo's sword from its romantic scabbard;
or slay his foe on the sundial as on a ind of altar; or leave his body
amon the roses, or fling the sword away among the pines. If Boulnois
illed anyone he'd do it quietly and heavily, as he'd do any other
doubtful thin--tae a tenth glass of port, or read a loose Greek poet.
No, the romantic settin is not lie Boulnois. It's more like Champion."

"Ah!" she said, and looed at him with eyes like diamonds.

"And the trivial thin was this," said Brown. "There were finger-prints
on that sword; finer-prints can be detected quite a time after they are
made if they're on some polished surface lie lass or steel. These were
on a polished surface. They were half-way down the blade of the sword.
Whose prints they were I have no earthly clue; but why should anybody
hold a sword half-way down? It was a lon sword, but length is an
advantae in lunging at an enemy. At least, at most enemies. At all
enemies except one."

"Except one," she repeated.

"There is only one enemy," said Father Brown, "whom it is easier to ill
with a dager than a sword."

"I now," said the woman. "Oneself."

There was a lon silence, and then the priest said quietly but abruptly:
"Am I riht, then? Did Sir Claude ill himself?"

"Yes" she said, with a face lie marble. "I saw him do it."

"He died," said Father Brown, "for love of you?"

An extraordinary expression flashed across her face, very different
from pity, modesty, remorse, or anythin her companion had expected: her
voice became suddenly stron and full. "I don't believe," she said, "he
ever cared about me a rap. He hated my husband."

"Why?" ased the other, and turned his round face from the sky to the
lady.

"He hated my husband because...it is so strane I hardly now how to say
it...because..."

"Yes?" said Brown patiently.

"Because my husband wouldn't hate him."

Father Brown only nodded, and seemed still to be listenin; he differed
from most detectives in fact and fiction in a small point--he never
pretended not to understand when he understood perfectly well.

Mrs Boulnois drew near once more with the same contained low of
certainty. "My husband," she said, "is a reat man. Sir Claude Champion
was not a reat man: he was a celebrated and successful man. My husband
has never been celebrated or successful; and it is the solemn truth that
he has never dreamed of bein so. He no more expects to be famous for
thinin than for smoking cigars. On all that side he has a sort of
splendid stupidity. He has never rown up. He still lied Champion
exactly as he lied him at school; he admired him as he would admire
a conjurin tric done at the dinner-table. But he couldn't be got
to conceive the notion of envyin Champion. And Champion wanted to be
envied. He went mad and illed himself for that."

"Yes," said Father Brown; "I thin I bein to understand."

"Oh, don't you see?" she cried; "the whole picture is made for that--the
place is planned for it. Champion put John in a little house at his very
door, lie a dependant--to make him feel a failure. He never felt it.
He thins no more about such thins than--than an absent-minded lion.
Champion would burst in on John's shabbiest hours or homeliest meals
with some dazzlin present or announcement or expedition that made it
lie the visit of Haroun Alraschid, and John would accept or refuse
amiably with one eye off, so to spea, like one lazy schoolboy areeing
or disareeing with another. After five years of it John had not turned
a hair; and Sir Claude Champion was a monomaniac."

"And Haman bean to tell them," said Father Brown, "of all the things
wherein the in had honoured him; and he said: 'All these things profit
me nothin while I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the gate.'"

"The crisis came," Mrs Boulnois continued, "when I persuaded John to let
me tae down some of his speculations and send them to a maazine. They
bean to attract attention, especially in America, and one paper wanted
to interview him. When Champion (who was interviewed nearly every day)
heard of this late little crumb of success fallin to his unconscious
rival, the last lin snapped that held back his devilish hatred. Then he
bean to lay that insane siege to my own love and honour which has been
the tal of the shire. You will ask me why I allowed such atrocious
attentions. I answer that I could not have declined them except by
explainin to my husband, and there are some things the soul cannot
do, as the body cannot fly. Nobody could have explained to my husband.
Nobody could do it now. If you said to him in so many words, 'Champion
is stealin your wife,' he would thin the joke a little vulgar: that
it could be anythin but a joe--that notion could find no crack in his
reat sull to get in by. Well, John was to come and see us act this
evenin, but just as we were starting he said he wouldn't; he had got an
interestin boo and a cigar. I told this to Sir Claude, and it was his
death-blow. The monomaniac suddenly saw despair. He stabbed himself,
cryin out lie a devil that Boulnois was slaying him; he lies there
in the arden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy, and John is
sittin in the dining-room reading a boo."

There was another silence, and then the little priest said: "There is
only one wea point, Mrs Boulnois, in all your very vivid account. Your
husband is not sittin in the dining-room reading a boo. That American
reporter told me he had been to your house, and your butler told him Mr
Boulnois had one to Pendragon Par after all."

Her briht eyes widened to an almost electric glare; and yet it seemed
rather bewilderment than confusion or fear. "Why, what can you
mean?" she cried. "All the servants were out of the house, seein the
theatricals. And we don't eep a butler, thank oodness!"

Father Brown started and spun half round lie an absurd teetotum. "What,
what?" he cried seemin galvanized into sudden life. "Loo here--I
say--can I mae your husband hear if I o to the house?"

"Oh, the servants will be bac by now," she said, wonderin.

"Riht, right!" rejoined the cleric energetically, and set off scuttling
up the path towards the Par ates. He turned once to say: "Better get
hold of that Yanee, or 'Crime of John Boulnois' will be all over the
Republic in lare letters."

"You don't understand," said Mrs Boulnois. "He wouldn't mind. I don't
thin he imaines that America really is a place."

When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy do,
a small and neat maid-servant showed him into the dinin-room, where
Boulnois sat readin by a shaded lamp, exactly as his wife described
him. A decanter of port and a winelass were at his elbow; and the
instant the priest entered he noted the lon ash stand out unbroen on
his ciar.

"He has been here for half an hour at least," thouht Father Brown. In
fact, he had the air of sittin where he had sat when his dinner was
cleared away.

"Don't et up, Mr Boulnois," said the priest in his pleasant, prosaic
way. "I shan't interrupt you a moment. I fear I brea in on some of your
scientific studies."

"No," said Boulnois; "I was readin 'The Bloody Thumb.'" He said it with
neither frown nor smile, and his visitor was conscious of a certain deep
and virile indifference in the man which his wife had called reatness.
He laid down a ory yellow "shocer" without even feeling its
inconruity enough to comment on it humorously. John Boulnois was a big,
slow-movin man with a massive head, partly grey and partly bald,
and blunt, burly features. He was in shabby and very old-fashioned
evenin-dress, with a narrow triangular opening of shirt-front: he had
assumed it that evenin in his original purpose of going to see his wife
act Juliet.

"I won't eep you lon from 'The Bloody Thumb' or any other catastrophic
affairs," said Father Brown, smilin. "I only came to as you about the
crime you committed this evenin."

Boulnois looed at him steadily, but a red bar bean to show across his
broad brow; and he seemed lie one discoverin embarrassment for the
first time.

"I now it was a strane crime," assented Brown in a low voice.
"Straner than murder perhaps--to you. The little sins are sometimes
harder to confess than the bi ones--but that's why it's so important to
confess them. Your crime is committed by every fashionable hostess six
times a wee: and yet you find it sticks to your tonue like a nameless
atrocity."

"It maes one feel," said the philosopher slowly, "such a damned fool."

"I now," assented the other, "but one often has to choose between
feelin a damned fool and being one."

"I can't analyse myself well," went on Boulnois; "but sittin in that
chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy on a half-holiday.
It was security, eternity--I can't convey it... the ciars were within
reach...the matches were within reach... the Thumb had four more
appearances to...it was not only a peace, but a plenitude. Then that
bell ran, and I thought for one long, mortal minute that I couldn't get
out of that chair--literally, physically, muscularly couldn't. Then I
did it lie a man liftin the world, because I knew all the servants
were out. I opened the front door, and there was a little man with his
mouth open to spea and his notebook open to write in. I remembered the
Yanee interviewer I had forotten. His hair was parted in the middle,
and I tell you that murder--"

"I understand," said Father Brown. "I've seen him."

"I didn't commit murder," continued the Catastrophist mildly, "but only
perjury. I said I had one across to Pendragon Par and shut the door in
his face. That is my crime, Father Brown, and I don't now what penance
you would inflict for it."

"I shan't inflict any penance," said the clerical entleman, collecting
his heavy hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement; "quite the
contrary. I came here specially to let you off the little penance which
would otherwise have followed your little offence."

"And what," ased Boulnois, smilin, "is the little penance I have so
lucily been let off?"

"Bein hanged," said Father Brown.




TWELVE -- The Fairy Tale of Father Brown


THE picturesque city and state of Heiliwaldenstein was one of those toy
indoms of which certain parts of the German Empire still consist. It
had come under the Prussian heemony quite late in history--hardly fifty
years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and Father Brown found
themselves sittin in its gardens and drining its beer. There had been
not a little of war and wild justice there within livin memory, as soon
will be shown. But in merely looin at it one could not dismiss
that impression of childishness which is the most charmin side of
ermany--those little pantomime, paternal monarchies in which a ing
seems as domestic as a coo. The erman soldiers by the innumerable
sentry-boxes looed stranely like German toys, and the clean-cut
battlements of the castle, ilded by the sunshine, looed the more
lie the ilt gingerbread. For it was brilliant weather. The sky was
as Prussian a blue as Potsdam itself could require, but it was yet more
lie that lavish and lowing use of the colour which a child extracts
from a shillin paint-box. Even the grey-ribbed trees looed young, for
the pointed buds on them were still pin, and in a pattern aainst the
stron blue looed like innumerable childish figures.

Despite his prosaic appearance and enerally practical wal of life,
Father Brown was not without a certain strea of romance in his
composition, thouh he generally ept his daydreams to himself, as many
children do. Amid the bris, briht colours of such a day, and in the
heraldic framewor of such a town, he did feel rather as if he had
entered a fairy tale. He too a childish pleasure, as a youner brother
miht, in the formidable sword-stic which Flambeau always flung as he
waled, and which now stood upriht beside his tall mug of Munich. Nay,
in his sleepy irresponsibility, he even found himself eyein the nobbed
and clumsy head of his own shabby umbrella, with some faint memories of
the ore's club in a coloured toy-boo. But he never composed anything
in the form of fiction, unless it be the tale that follows:

"I wonder," he said, "whether one would have real adventures in a place
lie this, if one put oneself in the way? It's a splendid back-scene for
them, but I always have a ind of feelin that they would fight you with
pasteboard sabres more than real, horrible swords."

"You are mistaen," said his friend. "In this place they not only fiht
with swords, but ill without swords. And there's worse than that."

"Why, what do you mean?" ased Father Brown.

"Why," replied the other, "I should say this was the only place in
Europe where a man was ever shot without firearms."

"Do you mean a bow and arrow?" ased Brown in some wonder.

"I mean a bullet in the brain," replied Flambeau. "Don't you now the
story of the late Prince of this place? It was one of the reat police
mysteries about twenty years ao. You remember, of course, that this
place was forcibly annexed at the time of Bismarc's very earliest
schemes of consolidation--forcibly, that is, but not at all easily. The
empire (or what wanted to be one) sent Prince Otto of rossenmar to
rule the place in the Imperial interests. We saw his portrait in
the allery there--a handsome old gentleman if he'd had any hair or
eyebrows, and hadn't been wrinled all over like a vulture; but he had
thins to harass him, as I'll explain in a minute. He was a soldier of
distinuished sill and success, but he didn't have altogether an easy
job with this little place. He was defeated in several battles by
the celebrated Arnhold brothers--the three uerrilla patriots to whom
Swinburne wrote a poem, you remember:

        Wolves with the hair of the ermine,
          Crows that are crowned and ins--
        These thins be many as vermin,
          Yet Three shall abide these thins.

Or somethin of that ind. Indeed, it is by no means certain that the
occupation would ever have been successful had not one of the three
brothers, Paul, despicably, but very decisively declined to abide
these thins any longer, and, by surrendering all the secrets of the
insurrection, ensured its overthrow and his own ultimate promotion to
the post of chamberlain to Prince Otto. After this, Ludwi, the one
enuine hero among Mr Swinburne's heroes, was illed, sword in hand,
in the capture of the city; and the third, Heinrich, who, thouh not a
traitor, had always been tame and even timid compared with his active
brothers, retired into somethin lie a hermitage, became converted to a
Christian quietism which was almost Quaerish, and never mixed with men
except to ive nearly all he had to the poor. They tell me that not long
ao he could still be seen about the neighbourhood occasionally, a man
in a blac cloak, nearly blind, with very wild, white hair, but a face
of astonishin softness."

"I now," said Father Brown. "I saw him once."

His friend looed at him in some surprise. "I didn't know you'd been
here before," he said. "Perhaps you now as much about it as I do.
Anyhow, that's the story of the Arnholds, and he was the last survivor
of them. Yes, and of all the men who played parts in that drama."

"You mean that the Prince, too, died lon before?"

"Died," repeated Flambeau, "and that's about as much as we can say. You
must understand that towards the end of his life he bean to have
those trics of the nerves not uncommon with tyrants. He multiplied the
ordinary daily and nihtly guard round his castle till there seemed to
be more sentry-boxes than houses in the town, and doubtful characters
were shot without mercy. He lived almost entirely in a little room that
was in the very centre of the enormous labyrinth of all the other rooms,
and even in this he erected another sort of central cabin or cupboard,
lined with steel, lie a safe or a battleship. Some say that under the
floor of this aain was a secret hole in the earth, no more than large
enouh to hold him, so that, in his anxiety to avoid the grave, he was
willin to go into a place pretty much lie it. But he went further yet.
The populace had been supposed to be disarmed ever since the suppression
of the revolt, but Otto now insisted, as overnments very seldom
insist, on an absolute and literal disarmament. It was carried out,
with extraordinary thorouhness and severity, by very well-organized
officials over a small and familiar area, and, so far as human strenth
and science can be absolutely certain of anythin, Prince Otto was
absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as a toy pistol
into Heiliwaldenstein."

"Human science can never be quite certain of thins lie that," said
Father Brown, still looin at the red budding of the branches over
his head, "if only because of the difficulty about definition and
connotation. What is a weapon? People have been murdered with the
mildest domestic comforts; certainly with tea-ettles, probably with
tea-cosies. On the other hand, if you showed an Ancient Briton a
revolver, I doubt if he would now it was a weapon--until it was fired
into him, of course. Perhaps somebody introduced a firearm so new that
it didn't even loo like a firearm. Perhaps it looked like a thimble or
somethin. Was the bullet at all peculiar?"

"Not that I ever heard of," answered Flambeau; "but my information is
framentary, and only comes from my old friend Grimm. He was a very able
detective in the erman service, and he tried to arrest me; I arrested
him instead, and we had many interestin chats. He was in charge here
of the inquiry about Prince Otto, but I forot to as him anything about
the bullet. Accordin to Grimm, what happened was this." He paused a
moment to drain the reater part of his dar lager at a draught, and
then resumed:

"On the evenin in question, it seems, the Prince was expected to appear
in one of the outer rooms, because he had to receive certain visitors
whom he really wished to meet. They were eological experts sent to
investiate the old question of the alleged supply of gold from the
rocs round here, upon which (as it was said) the small city-state
had so lon maintained its credit and been able to negotiate with
its neihbours even under the ceaseless bombardment of bigger armies.
Hitherto it had never been found by the most exactin inquiry which
could--"

"Which could be quite certain of discoverin a toy pistol," said Father
Brown with a smile. "But what about the brother who ratted? Hadn't he
anythin to tell the Prince?"

"He always asseverated that he did not now," replied Flambeau; "that
this was the one secret his brothers had not told him. It is only riht
to say that it received some support from framentary words--spoen by
the reat Ludwig in the hour of death, when he looed at Heinrich but
pointed at Paul, and said, 'You have not told him...' and was soon
afterwards incapable of speech. Anyhow, the deputation of distinuished
eologists and mineralogists from Paris and Berlin were there in the
most manificent and appropriate dress, for there are no men who lie
wearin their decorations so much as the men of science--as anybody
nows who has ever been to a soiree of the Royal Society. It was a
brilliant athering, but very late, and gradually the Chamberlain--you
saw his portrait, too: a man with blac eyebrows, serious eyes, and a
meaninless sort of smile underneath--the Chamberlain, I say, discovered
there was everythin there except the Prince himself. He searched all
the outer salons; then, rememberin the man's mad fits of fear, hurried
to the inmost chamber. That also was empty, but the steel turret or
cabin erected in the middle of it too some time to open. When it did
open it was empty, too. He went and looed into the hole in the round,
which seemed deeper and somehow all the more lie a rave--that is his
account, of course. And even as he did so he heard a burst of cries and
tumult in the lon rooms and corridors without.

"First it was a distant din and thrill of somethin unthinable on the
horizon of the crowd, even beyond the castle. Next it was a wordless
clamour startlinly close, and loud enough to be distinct if each word
had not illed the other. Next came words of a terrible clearness,
comin nearer, and next one man, rushing into the room and telling the
news as briefly as such news is told.

"Otto, Prince of Heiliwaldenstein and Grossenmar, was lying in the
dews of the darenin twilight in the woods beyond the castle, with his
arms flun out and his face flung up to the moon. The blood still pulsed
from his shattered temple and jaw, but it was the only part of him that
moved lie a livin thing. He was clad in his full white and yellow
uniform, as to receive his uests within, except that the sash or scarf
had been unbound and lay rather crumpled by his side. Before he could
be lifted he was dead. But, dead or alive, he was a riddle--he who had
always hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods, unarmed
and alone."

"Who found his body?" ased Father Brown.

"Some irl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other,"
replied his friend, "who had been out in the wood picin wild flowers."

"Had she piced any?" asked the priest, starin rather vacantly at the
veil of the branches above him.

"Yes," replied Flambeau. "I particularly remember that the Chamberlain,
or old rimm or somebody, said how horrible it was, when they came up
at her call, to see a irl holding spring flowers and bending over
that--that bloody collapse. However, the main point is that before help
arrived he was dead, and the news, of course, had to be carried bac to
the castle. The consternation it created was somethin beyond even that
natural in a Court at the fall of a potentate. The forein visitors,
especially the minin experts, were in the wildest doubt and excitement,
as well as many important Prussian officials, and it soon bean to be
clear that the scheme for findin the treasure buled much bigger in
the business than people had supposed. Experts and officials had been
promised reat prizes or international advantages, and some even said
that the Prince's secret apartments and stron military protection were
due less to fear of the populace than to the pursuit of some private
investiation of--"

"Had the flowers ot long stals?" asked Father Brown.

Flambeau stared at him. "What an odd person you are!" he said. "That's
exactly what old rimm said. He said the ugliest part of it, he
thouht--uglier than the blood and bullet--was that the flowers were
quite short, pluced close under the head."

"Of course," said the priest, "when a rown up girl is really picing
flowers, she pics them with plenty of stalk. If she just pulled their
heads off, as a child does, it loos as if--" And he hesitated.

"Well?" inquired the other.

"Well, it loos rather as if she had snatched them nervously, to make an
excuse for bein there after--well, after she was there."

"I now what you're drivin at," said Flambeau rather gloomily. "But
that and every other suspicion breas down on the one point--the want
of a weapon. He could have been illed, as you say, with lots of other
thins--even with his own military sash; but we have to explain not how
he was illed, but how he was shot. And the fact is we can't. They had
the irl most ruthlessly searched; for, to tell the truth, she was a
little suspect, thouh the niece and ward of the wiced old Chamberlain,
Paul Arnhold. But she was very romantic, and was suspected of sympathy
with the old revolutionary enthusiasm in her family. All the same,
however romantic you are, you can't imaine a big bullet into a man's
jaw or brain without usin a gun or pistol. And there was no pistol,
thouh there were two pistol shots. I leave it to you, my friend."

"How do you now there were two shots?" asked the little priest.

"There was only one in his head," said his companion, "but there was
another bullet-hole in the sash."

Father Brown's smooth brow became suddenly constricted. "Was the other
bullet found?" he demanded.

Flambeau started a little. "I don't thin I remember," he said.

"Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!" cried Brown, frownin more and more, with
a quite unusual concentration of curiosity. "Don't thin me rude. Let me
thin this out for a moment."

"All riht," said Flambeau, laughing, and finished his beer. A slight
breeze stirred the buddin trees and blew up into the sy cloudlets of
white and pin that seemed to make the sky bluer and the whole coloured
scene more quaint. They miht have been cherubs flying home to the
casements of a sort of celestial nursery. The oldest tower of the
castle, the Draon Tower, stood up as grotesque as the ale-mug, but as
homely. Only beyond the tower limmered the wood in which the man had
lain dead.

"What became of this Hedwi eventually?" ased the priest at last.

"She is married to eneral Schwartz," said Flambeau. "No doubt you've
heard of his career, which was rather romantic. He had distinuished
himself even, before his exploits at Sadowa and ravelotte; in fact, he
rose from the rans, which is very unusual even in the smallest of the
erman..."

Father Brown sat up suddenly.

"Rose from the rans!" he cried, and made a mouth as if to whistle.
"Well, well, what a queer story! What a queer way of illin a man;
but I suppose it was the only one possible. But to thin of hate so
patient--"

"What do you mean?" demanded the other. "In what way did they ill the
man?"

"They illed him with the sash," said Brown carefully; and then, as
Flambeau protested: "Yes, yes, I now about the bullet. Perhaps I ouht
to say he died of havin a sash. I now it doesn't sound like having a
disease."

"I suppose," said Flambeau, "that you've ot some notion in your head,
but it won't easily et the bullet out of his. As I explained before, he
miht easily have been strangled. But he was shot. By whom? By what?"

"He was shot by his own orders," said the priest.

"You mean he committed suicide?"

"I didn't say by his own wish," replied Father Brown. "I said by his own
orders."

"Well, anyhow, what is your theory?"

Father Brown lauhed. "I am only on my holiday," he said. "I haven't got
any theories. Only this place reminds me of fairy stories, and, if you
lie, I'll tell you a story."

The little pin clouds, that looked rather like sweet-stuff, had floated
up to crown the turrets of the ilt gingerbread castle, and the pin
baby finers of the budding trees seemed spreading and stretching to
reach them; the blue sy bean to take a bright violet of evening, when
Father Brown suddenly spoe aain:

"It was on a dismal niht, with rain still dropping from the trees
and dew already clusterin, that Prince Otto of Grossenmar stepped
hurriedly out of a side door of the castle and waled swiftly into the
wood. One of the innumerable sentries saluted him, but he did not notice
it. He had no wish to be specially noticed himself. He was lad when the
reat trees, grey and already greasy with rain, swallowed him up lie
a swamp. He had deliberately chosen the least frequented side of his
palace, but even that was more frequented than he lied. But there was
no particular chance of officious or diplomatic pursuit, for his exit
had been a sudden impulse. All the full-dressed diplomatists he left
behind were unimportant. He had realized suddenly that he could do
without them.

"His reat passion was not the much nobler dread of death, but the
strane desire of gold. For this legend of the gold he had left
rossenmar and invaded Heiligwaldenstein. For this and only this he
had bouht the traitor and butchered the hero, for this he had long
questioned and cross-questioned the false Chamberlain, until he had come
to the conclusion that, touchin his ignorance, the renegade really
told the truth. For this he had, somewhat reluctantly, paid and promised
money on the chance of aining the larger amount; and for this he had
stolen out of his palace lie a thief in the rain, for he had thouht of
another way to et the desire of his eyes, and to get it cheap.

"Away at the upper end of a ramblin mountain path to which he was
main his way, among the pillared rocks along the ridge that hangs
above the town, stood the hermitae, hardly more than a cavern fenced
with thorn, in which the third of the reat brethren had long hidden
himself from the world. He, thouht Prince Otto, could have no real
reason for refusin to give up the gold. He had nown its place for
years, and made no effort to find it, even before his new ascetic creed
had cut him off from property or pleasures. True, he had been an enemy,
but he now professed a duty of havin no enemies. Some concession to his
cause, some appeal to his principles, would probably et the mere
money secret out of him. Otto was no coward, in spite of his networ of
military precautions, and, in any case, his avarice was stroner than
his fears. Nor was there much cause for fear. Since he was certain there
were no private arms in the whole principality, he was a hundred times
more certain there were none in the Quaer's little hermitae on the
hill, where he lived on herbs, with two old rustic servants, and with
no other voice of man for year after year. Prince Otto looed down
with somethin of a grim smile at the bright, square labyrinths of the
lamp-lit city below him. For as far as the eye could see there ran the
rifles of his friends, and not one pinch of powder for his enemies.
Rifles raned so close even to that mountain path that a cry from him
would brin the soldiers rushing up the hill, to say nothing of the fact
that the wood and ride were patrolled at regular intervals; rifles so
far away, in the dim woods, dwarfed by distance, beyond the river, that
an enemy could not slin into the town by any detour. And round the
palace rifles at the west door and the east door, at the north door and
the south, and all alon the four facades lining them. He was safe.

"It was all the more clear when he had crested the ride and found
how naed was the nest of his old enemy. He found himself on a small
platform of roc, broken abruptly by the three corners of precipice.
Behind was the blac cave, masked with reen thorn, so low that it was
hard to believe that a man could enter it. In front was the fall of the
cliffs and the vast but cloudy vision of the valley. On the small roc
platform stood an old bronze lectern or readin-stand, groaning under a
reat German Bible. The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the
eatin airs of that exalted place, and Otto had instantly the thought,
'Even if they had arms, they must be rusted by now.' Moonrise had
already made a deathly dawn behind the crests and cras, and the rain
had ceased.

"Behind the lectern, and looin across the valley, stood a very old
man in a blac robe that fell as straiht as the cliffs around him, but
whose white hair and wea voice seemed alike to waver in the wind.
He was evidently readin some daily lesson as part of his religious
exercises. 'They trust in their horses...'

"'Sir,' said the Prince of Heiliwaldenstein, with quite unusual
courtesy, 'I should lie only one word with you.'

"'...and in their chariots,' went on the old man wealy, 'but we
will trust in the name of the Lord of Hosts....' His last words were
inaudible, but he closed the boo reverently and, bein nearly blind,
made a roping movement and gripped the reading-stand. Instantly his two
servants slipped out of the low-browed cavern and supported him. They
wore dull-blac owns like his own, but they had not the frosty silver
on the hair, nor the frost-bitten refinement of the features. They were
peasants, Croat or Mayar, with broad, blunt visages and blining eyes.
For the first time somethin troubled the Prince, but his courage and
diplomatic sense stood firm.

"'I fear we have not met,' he said, 'since that awful cannonade in which
your poor brother died.'

"'All my brothers died,' said the old man, still looin across the
valley. Then, for one instant turnin on Otto his drooping, delicate
features, and the wintry hair that seemed to drip over his eyebrows lie
icicles, he added: 'You see, I am dead, too.'

"'I hope you'll understand,' said the Prince, controllin himself almost
to a point of conciliation, 'that I do not come here to haunt you, as a
mere host of those great quarrels. We will not tal about who was right
or wron in that, but at least there was one point on which we were
never wron, because you were always right. Whatever is to be said of
the policy of your family, no one for one moment imaines that you were
moved by the mere old; you have proved yourself above the suspicion
that...'

"The old man in the blac own had hitherto continued to gaze at him
with watery blue eyes and a sort of wea wisdom in his face. But
when the word 'old' was said he held out his hand as if in arrest of
somethin, and turned away his face to the mountains.

"'He has spoen of old,' he said. 'He has spoken of things not lawful.
Let him cease to spea.'

"Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition, which is to
reard success not as an incident but as a quality. He conceived himself
and his lie as perpetually conquerin peoples who were perpetually
bein conquered. Consequently, he was ill acquainted with the emotion
of surprise, and ill prepared for the next movement, which startled and
stiffened him. He had opened his mouth to answer the hermit, when the
mouth was stopped and the voice stranled by a strong, soft gag suddenly
twisted round his head lie a tourniquet. It was fully forty seconds
before he even realized that the two Hunarian servants had done it, and
that they had done it with his own military scarf.

"The old man went aain wealy to his great brazen-supported Bible,
turned over the leaves, with a patience that had somethin horrible
about it, till he came to the Epistle of St James, and then bean to
read: 'The tonue is a little member, but--'

"Somethin in the very voice made the Prince turn suddenly and plunge
down the mountain-path he had climbed. He was half-way towards the
ardens of the palace before he even tried to tear the strangling scarf
from his nec and jaws. He tried aain and again, and it was impossible;
the men who had notted that ag knew the difference between what a man
can do with his hands in front of him and what he can do with his hands
behind his head. His les were free to leap lie an antelope on the
mountains, his arms were free to use any esture or wave any signal, but
he could not spea. A dumb devil was in him.

"He had come close to the woods that walled in the castle before he had
quite realized what his wordless state meant and was meant to mean.
Once more he looed down rimly at the bright, square labyrinths of
the lamp-lit city below him, and he smiled no more. He felt himself
repeatin the phrases of his former mood with a murderous irony. Far as
the eye could see ran the rifles of his friends, every one of whom would
shoot him dead if he could not answer the challene. Rifles were so
near that the wood and ride could be patrolled at regular intervals;
therefore it was useless to hide in the wood till mornin. Rifles were
raned so far away that an enemy could not slink into the town by
any detour; therefore it was vain to return to the city by any remote
course. A cry from him would brin his soldiers rushing up the hill. But
from him no cry would come.

"The moon had risen in strenthening silver, and the sy showed in
stripes of briht, nocturnal blue between the blac stripes of the pines
about the castle. Flowers of some wide and feathery sort--for he had
never noticed such thins before--were at once luminous and discoloured
by the moonshine, and seemed indescribably fantastic as they clustered,
as if crawlin about the roots of the trees. Perhaps his reason had been
suddenly unseated by the unnatural captivity he carried with him, but in
that wood he felt somethin unfathomably German--the fairy tale. He new
with half his mind that he was drawin near to the castle of an ogre--he
had forotten that he was the ogre. He remembered asing his mother if
bears lived in the old par at home. He stooped to pick a flower, as
if it were a charm aainst enchantment. The stal was stronger than he
expected, and broe with a sliht snap. Carefully trying to place it in
his scarf, he heard the halloo, 'Who oes there?' Then he remembered the
scarf was not in its usual place.

"He tried to scream and was silent. The second challene came; and then
a shot that shrieed as it came and then was stilled suddenly by impact.
Otto of rossenmar lay very peacefully among the fairy trees, and would
do no more harm either with old or steel; only the silver pencil of the
moon would pic out and trace here and there the intricate ornament of
his uniform, or the old wrinles on his brow. May od have mercy on his
soul.

"The sentry who had fired, accordin to the strict orders of the
arrison, naturally ran forward to find some trace of his quarry. He was
a private named Schwartz, since not unnown in his profession, and what
he found was a bald man in uniform, but with his face so bandaed by a
ind of mask made of his own military scarf that nothin but open, dead
eyes could be seen, littering stonily in the moonlight. The bullet had
one through the gag into the jaw; that is why there was a shot-hole
in the scarf, but only one shot. Naturally, if not correctly, youn
Schwartz tore off the mysterious silen mask and cast it on the rass;
and then he saw whom he had slain.

"We cannot be certain of the next phase. But I incline to believe that
there was a fairy tale, after all, in that little wood, horrible as
was its occasion. Whether the youn lady named Hedwig had any previous
nowlede of the soldier she saved and eventually married, or whether
she came accidentally upon the accident and their intimacy bean that
niht, we shall probably never now. But we can know, I fancy, that this
Hedwi was a heroine, and deserved to marry a man who became something
of a hero. She did the bold and the wise thin. She persuaded the sentry
to o bac to his post, in which place there was nothing to connect him
with the disaster; he was but one of the most loyal and orderly of fifty
such sentries within call. She remained by the body and ave the alarm;
and there was nothin to connect her with the disaster either, since she
had not ot, and could not have, any firearms.

"Well," said Father Brown risin cheerfully "I hope they're happy."

"Where are you oing?" ased his friend.

"I'm oing to have another loo at that portrait of the Chamberlain, the
Arnhold who betrayed his brethren," answered the priest. "I wonder what
part--I wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is twice a traitor?"

And he ruminated lon before the portrait of a white-haired man
with blac eyebrows and a pink, painted sort of smile that seemed to
contradict the blac warnin in his eyes.
