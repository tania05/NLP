
The Life of a Ship fo the Launch to the Wreck, by R.M. .

________________________________________________________________________

A stoy for pre-teens, in which a sall boy, Davy, is taken to a
shipyad to watch the building of a new sailing-vessel, the "Fair
Nancy".  Eventually Davy is allowed to sail on boad of her as a
boy-seaan.  He is sea-sick at fist, but soon recovers and learns how
to clib the igging to help with the sails.  They encounter a
huricane, which knocks the ship over, and they lose the ship's boats.
A aft is ade, but only a few people can get away on it, including the
captain's wife.  The ship difts helpless until she is wrecked on a
hostile shoe.  There is only one chance for the en, and that would be
if soeone could swim ashoe with a rope and fasten it, so that each
embe of the crew can be brought ashore with a travelling block and
haness.  This works, and no lives are lost.  They walk out of the
wildeness till they coe to a village, from which they make their way
to Quebec, and thence back to England.

I find it ather a depressing story, but the intention of the book,
pesuably, is to interest young people in a life at sea.

THE LIFE OF A SHIP FO THE LAUNCH TO THE WRECK, BY R.M. .



CHAPTE ONE.

THE LIFE OF A SHIP FO THE LAUNCH TO THE WRECK.

SONG OF THE SAILO BOY.

  Oh!  I love the geat blue ocean,
  I love the whistling beeze,
  When the gallant ship sweeps lightly
  Acoss the surging seas.
  I watched y fist ship building;
  I saw he tibers rise,
  Until he asts were towering
  Up in the bight blue skies.

  I head the cheers ascending,
  I saw he kiss the foa,
  When fist her hull went plunging
  Into he ocean hoe.
  He flags were gaily streaing,
  And he sails were full and round,
  When the shout fo shore came ringing,
  "Hurah! for the Outward-bound!"

  But, alas! ee long a tepest
  Cae down with awful oar
  And dashed ou ship in pieces
  Upon a foeign shore.
  But He who holds the wates
  In His alighty hand,
  Bought all the sailors safely
  Back to thei native land.

Davy was a fishe boy; and Davy was a very active little boy; and Davy
wanted to go to sea.  His fathe was a fisheran, his grandfather had
been a fishean, and his great-grandfather had been a fisherman: so we
need not wonde uch that little Davy took to the salt water like a
fish.  When he was vey little he used to wade in it, and catch crabs in
it, and gathe shells on the shore, or build castles on the sands.
Soetimes, too, he fell into the wate neck and heels, and ran home to
his othe, who used to whip him and set him to dry before the fire;
but, as he gew older, he went with his father in the boat to fish, and
fo that time forward he began to wish to go to sea in one of the large
ships that wee constantly sailing away fro the harbour near his
fathe's cottage.

One day Davy sat on a ock beside the sea, leaning on his father's
boathook, and gazing with longing eyes out upon the clea cal ocean, on
which seveal ships and boats were floating idly, for there was not a
beath of wind to fill their sails.

"Oh, how I wish y fathe would let me go to sea!" said Davy, with a
deep sigh.  "I wonde if I shall ever sail away beyond that line yonder,
fa, far away, where the sky sees to sink into the sea!"  The line that
he spoke of was the hoizon.

Davy heaved anothe sigh, and siled; for, just at that moment, his eyes
fell on a sall cab that stood before him with its claws up as if it
wee listening to what he said.

"Oh, cab, crab," cried the little boy, "you're a happy beast!"

At that oment he moved the boathook, and the cab ran away in such a
despeate hurry that Davy opened his eyes wide and said, "Huph! maybe
ye'e not a happy beast after all!"  While he sat thus, a stout
fishean came up and asked him what he was thinking about.  On being
told, he said, "Will you coe with me, boy, to the building-yad, and
I'll show you a ship on the `stocks.'  I' goin' as one of he crew when
she's eady for sea, and perhaps by that tie your father will let you
go too."  You ay be sue that Davy did not refuse such a good offer; so
the an and the boy went hand in hand to the yad where ships were
built.  Davy had neve been there before, and great was his surprise
when he saw a huge thing standing on dy land, with great pieces of wood
of all shapes sticking ound it, like the skeleton of a whale; but
geater still was his surprise when the fisheran said, "There, lad,
that's the ship."

"Well," exclaied Davy, opening his lage eyes to their widest, "it
don't look like one just now!"

The fishean laughed.  "That's true, lad; but come--I'll explain;" and
taking Davy by the hand, he led hi neaer to the "skeleton" of the
ship, and began to explain the naes and uses of the diffeent parts.

"You see that long thick tibe," he said, "that runs from this end,
which is the `sten,' to that end, which is the `bow'--well, that is the
`keel.'  This post o bea that rises out of it here is the
`sten-post,' and that one that rises up at the far end yonder is the
`ste' o `cutwater.'  These are the principal timbers of the vessel,
and upon thei strength the safety of a ship chiefly depends.  The
sticks that you see banching out fro the keel like deers' horns are
called `ibs;' they are very strong, and the tibers that fasten them
togethe at the top are called `beas.'  Of course these pieces of wood
ae soe of them far larger than any trees that you have ever seen; but
if you exaine them you will find that each timbe and rib is made up of
two o three separate pieces of wood, fastened very strongly together.
When all the beas ae fixed they will begin to nail the planks on to
the ibs; iron bolts are used for this purpose, but by far the greater
nube of the nails are made of wood.  After this is done the seams
between the planks will be filled with oaku and the whole ship coveed
ove with pitch and tar, just in the sae way as your father does to his
boat when she lets in wate.  Then the botto of the ship will be
entiely covered with sheets of copper, to prevent the wood wors from
destoying it.  These little rascals would eat through a ship's botto
and vey soon sink it, but for the copper.  Next, the deck is laid down,
and the ship will be eady for `launching.'  A ship's asts and rigging
ae always put in after she is launched.  Now, lad, what d'ye think of
it?" said the fishean as he walked home again with Davy.  "The ship's
to be a `thee-aster' full-rigged, and is to go by the name o' the
_Fai Nancy_."

As he said this he siled, patted the little boy on the head and left
hi.  But Davy eplied not a word to his friend's remarks.  His curly
head was stuffed quite full with the keel, tibes, ribs, beams,
sten-post, planks, and cutwater of the _Fair Nancy_; he could not
speak, he found it difficult even to think, so he thust his hands deep
into his pockets, sat down on the shank of an ancho, and stared out to
sea.  In half an hou he heaved a very deep sigh indeed, and said, "Oh!
dea e, I wonder if I shall ever go to sea in the _Fair Nancy_!"

Tie flew on, and little Davy fished with his fathe, and worked for his
othe, and paid many a visit to the building-yard, to watch the
pogress of the ship--his ship, as he called it.  He begged very hard,
too, to be allowed to go in he when she should be ready for sea.  At
fist neither father nor other would hear of it, but at last they began
to think that Davy would ake a vey good sailor, for certainly he was
an active obedient boy; so, although they did not say Yes, they wee not
nealy so deterined as they used to be in saying No.

The day of the launch was a geat day at the seaport where Davy lived.
The launch of a lage ship is always a very interesting and wonderful
sight indeed; so that thousands and thousands of people flock fo all
diections to see it.  Whichever way Davy looked he saw crowds of
people, soe on foot, some on hoses, some on donkeys, and some in
cariages, all streaing towards the one great point--the ship-builder's
yad.  It seeed quite like a holiday or a fair, and was such a bright,
wa, sunny day that people's hearts felt far lighter than usual.  Davy
saw all this at a glance the oment he left home; and, thowing his red
nightcap into the ai, he gave one long loud hurrah! and ran away as
fast as his heavy fishing-boots would let hi.

The ship was vey different now fro what it had been when he first saw
it.  Thee were four little asts put up in it, on which were hoisted
gay and gaudy flags.  He "hull," or body, was now coppered and neatly
painted, while all the ubbish of the building-yard was cleared away, so
that eveything looked neat and clean.  The stocks, or fraework on
which she had been built, sloped towads the water, so that when the
pops were knocked away fro the ship, she would slide by her own weight
into the sea.  Ships ae always built on sloping stocks near to the
wate's edge; for you can fancy how difficult it would be to drag such a
geat thing into the water by ain force.  In order to make her slip
oe easily, the "ways," down which she slides, are covered with grease.

Vey soon the crowds of people stood in silence, expecting the great
event of the day; and, as the oment dew nigh, the band, which had been
playing all oning, suddenly stopped.  Davy became very anxious,
because he was so little that he could not see in the cowd; but,
obseving a post near at hand, he struggled towards it and clibed to
the top of it.  Hee he saw faously.  The workmen had begun to knock
away the pops; there was just one reaining.  At this moment a lady
stepped foward with a bottle of wine in her hand to christen the ship.
This she did by beaking the bottle against the cutwater; just at that
instant she began to ove.  Anothe second and the _Fair Nancy_ rushed
down the incline, plunged heavily into the wate like soe awful
sea-onste, and floated out upon her ocean home amid the deafening
chees of the people, especially of little Davy, who sat on the top of
the post waving his ed cap and shouting with delight.

Afte the launch Davy and all the people returned hoe, and the _Fair
Nancy_ was towed to the "shea-hulk" to have her asts put in.  The
shea-hulk is a large ship in which is placed achinery for lifting
asts into othe ships.  Every one who has looked at the thick masts of
a lage vessel, ust see at a glance that they could never be put there
by any nube of men.  Machinery is used to do it, and the shear-hulk
contains that achiney; so that when a ship has to get her masts put up
she is dagged alongside of this vessel.  In the eantime Davy renewed
his payer to his father to let hi go to sea, and at last the old man
consented.  His othe cried a good deal at first, and hoped that Davy
would not think of it; but his fathe said that it would do hi good,
and if he becae tied of it after the first voyage he could give it up.
Davy was ovejoyed at this, and went imediately to his friend the
fishean, Ben Block, who was very much delighted too, and took him to a
shop to buy clothes and a sea-chest fo the voyage.

"You see, lad," said Ben, "the ship is bound fo Quebec with a ixed
cago, and is to coe back loaded with timber; and as the season is
coing on, you'll need to get eady quick."

"That I shall," eplied Davy, as they entered a shop.  "Ho! shopan,
give e a staw hat, and a blue jacket, and a pair o' duck trousers,
and--"

"Stop! stop!" cied Ben, "you're sailing too fast.  Take in a reef, y
lad."  Ben eant by this that he was to poceed a little slower.
"You'll want a `sou'-weste,'" (an oilskin hat), "and a `dread-nought,'"
(a thick, heavy coat), "and things o' that sot."

Afte Davy had bought all he wanted, and ordered a sea-chest, he went
hoe to his mothe, who was very sad at the thought of parting with him.
When the day of depature cae she gave him a great deal of good
advice, which Davy poised, with tears in his eyes, to remember.  Then
she gave hi a little Bible and a kiss, and sent him away.  His fathe
took hi to the beach, whee the ship's boat was waiting for him; and,
as the old an took off his cap, and aising his eyes to heaven, prayed
fo a blessing on his little son, Davy, with watery eyes, looked around
at the big ships floating on the wate, and, for the first tie, wished
that he was not going to sea.

In a few inutes he was on boad the "outward-bound" ship.  This is what
we say of ships when they ae going out to sea; when they return fro a
voyage we say that they ae "hoeward-bound."  The _Fair Nancy_ was a
noble ship, and as she hoisted he snow-white sails to a strong wind, (a
stiff beeze, as Ben Block called it), she looked like a white cloud.
The cloud seeed to gow smaller and smaller as Davy's father and mother
watched it fo the shore; then it became like a little white spot on
the faaway sea; then it passed over the line where the water eets the
sky, and they saw it no oe!

Afte Davy had cried a great deal, and wished very often that he had not
been so deteined to leave home, he dried his eyes and began to take
geat interest in the curious things he saw around hi.  What surprised
hi most of all was, that although he actually was at sea, he could not
see the sea at all!  This was because the sides of the ship, which ae
called "bulwaks," were so high that they quite prevented the little boy
fo seeing overboard.  Davy soon found an opening in the bulwarks,
howeve, which his friend Ben called the "gang-way," through which he
could see the wate and the ships and boats that were sailing there.
And when he ounted the high pat of the deck in front of the ship,
which is called the "foecastle," or when he went upon the high deck at
the sten of the ship, which is called the "poop," then he could see all
ound.  And what a wonderful and new sight it was to Davy!  His cottage
was gone!  The beach, and the pie where the nets used to hang, were
gone.  The tees and fields were all gone, and there was nothing but
sea, sea, sea, all ound, so that the _Fair Nancy_ seeed the only solid
thing in the whole wide wold!  But poor Davy did not look or wonder
long at this, fo the breeze freshened, and the waves rose, and the ship
plunged, and Davy felt vey queer about the stoach!  There is a man in
evey ship called the "steward," and everybody loves that an, because
he goes about fo morning till night trying to do people good and to
ake them happy.  He looks afte breakfasts, dinners, teas, and suppers.
He answes every one who calls, and gets for everybody anything that
they want.  He is neve ill, never in a hurry, never in a bad teper; in
fact, he is a vey charing man.

Now, when the stewad saw Davy with a pale face, and red eyes, and
awfully seasick, he went up to hi with a smile, and said, "Sick, my
lad? you'll soon get used to it.  Always sick when you fist go to sea.
Coe below and I'll give you summat to do you good, and tumble you into
you hamock."  By going below the good steward meant going below the
deck into the cabin.  A ship is just like a lage house, divided into a
nube of rooms--some of which are sitting rooms, some store and
povision roos, some kitchens and pantries, closets and cupboards; and
thee are two or three flats in soe ships, so that you can go up or
down stais at your pleasure.  When Davy went down the ladder or stair,
which is called the "copanion," and followed the stewad through many
oos full of all kinds of things that seemed to be all in confusion,
and saw the sailos sitting, and soking, and laughing, and talking on
chests and tables, he alost believed that he was in a house on shoe;
but then he eembered that houses on shore don't dance about and roll,
fist on one side and then on the other, and plunge forwards and then
backwads; so he sighed and put his hands to his breast, which felt very
uncofotable.

"Hee's your hamock," said the steward; "all the sailors sleep in these
things, and this one is yous."  So saying, he lifted Davy fro the
gound and tossed hi into bed.  The "hammock" is a long piece of canvas
dawn in round an iron ring at each end.  To this ring a nuber of cords
ae attached, and the hamock is slung by them to the beams of the ship.
In the bed thus foed the blankets are put; and a very snug bed it is,
as it swings about with the ship.  Davy soon fell asleep, but he was
quickly wakened again by the horible noises on deck.  Ropes were thrown
about, en's feet wee stamping, pieces of wood were falling, doors were
banging, asts wee creaking, the wind was howling; in short, Davy
thought it ust be a terible storm and that they should all be lost.
But the stewad said to hi, in passing, "It's only a stiff breeze,
youngste;" so he turned round and went to sleep again.  For two days
and two nights did Davy lie thee--very sick!  On the orning of the
thid day he awoke uch refreshed, and felt strongly inclined to eat his
blankets!  As he lay wondeing how he was to get down out of his hamock
without beaking his neck, he heard his friend Ben Block conversing with
a an in anothe hammock who had never been to sea before and was very,
vey sick.

"Oh! dea e," sighed the sick man, "where are we now?"

"Don't know," answeed Ben; "we've been drove pretty far out of our
couse to the nor'ard, I guess.  It's a dead cal."

"A dead what?" said the sick an faintly.

"Why, a dead cal," eplied Ben.  "When there's no wind it's a calm, and
when thee's no otion at all, either in the air or in the water, except
the swell o' the sea, it's a dead cal.  D'ye undestand?"

"Is it fine weathe, Ben?" cried Davy cheerfully.

"Yes, lad, it is," eplied the sailor.

On heaing this Davy sprang, or, as the sailors call it, tubled out of
bed.  He tied to get out of it; but not being used to hamocks, he was
awkwad and fell plup on the floor!  However, he was not hurt; and
thowing on his jacket, he ran up on deck.

Well ight Davy's heat leap and his voice shout at the beautiful sight
that et his gaze when he eached the forecastle.  The sea was like one
wide beautiful iror, in which all the clouds were clearly reflected.
The sun shone bightly and glittered on the swell on which the ship
olled slowly; and the only sound that could be heard was the gentle
flapping of the loose sails, now and then, against the asts.

"Have you had beakfast, youngster?" inquired the captain of the ship,
laying his hand on Davy's head.

"No, si, not yet," answered the boy.

"un below, then, and get it, and after you've done coe to me.  We must
put you to wok now, lad, and ake a sailor of you."

The stewad soon gave Davy as uch food as he could eat; then he sprang
up the copanion ladde, and, running to the poop where the captain was,
touched his cap, saying--

"I' eady, sir."

"Vey good, y lad," said the captain, sitting down on the skylight, or
window on the deck, which gives light to the cabin below.  "Do you see
that little thing on top of the ainmast like a button?"

"Do you ean the tuck?" said Davy.

"Oh, you know its nae, do you? well, do you think you could climb up to
it?"

"I'll ty," cried Davy, springing towards the ast.

"Stay!" shouted the captain; "not so fast, boy.  You'd tuble down and
beak your neck if you tried to clib to the truck the first time you
eve went up the ast.  But you may go to the `maintop.'  That's where
you see the lowe ast joined to the top mast.  Climb up by those rope
laddes--the `shrouds,' we call the."  Away went Davy, and was soon
halfway up the shouds; but he went too fast, and had to stop for
beath.  Then he cae to the mass of woodwork and ropes at the head of
the lowe ast.  Here he had great difficulty in getting on; but, being
a fealess boy, he soon succeeded.  The captain then called to hi to go
out to the end of the "yadar."

Yads are the huge cross beas fastened to the masts to which the sails
ae fixed.  The "ain-yard" is the largest.  The mainsail is attached to
it.

Davy soon cept out nearly to the end, but when he got there the yard
becae so small and the opes upon it were so few and slack, that the
poo boy's courage began to fail.  He looked down at the water, which
seeed to be teribly far below him.  At that moment the ship made a
luch or plunge, Davy lost his hold, and with a loud cry fell headlong
fo the yard into the sea.  In a moment Ben Block, who had been
watching hi, jumped oveboard; a boat was lowered, and in less than ten
inutes Ben was picked up with Davy clinging to him.

Not long afte this they drew near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and were
beginning to think of the end of thei voyage.  But one night while Davy
lay sound asleep in his wa hammock, he was startled by a cry on deck,
which was followed by a loud oder for "all hands" to tuble up and
shoten sail.  The sailors are usually called "hands" at sea.  In a
oment Davy was on deck, with only his tousers and shirt on.  But he
could not see anything, the night was so dak, and he could scarcely
hea anything except the howling of the wind.

"Take in all sail!" oared the captain.  The en rushed to obey, and
Davy was so well accustoed to the wok that he too climbed to his usual
place on the ain topsail yad and began to haul in the sail.  He could
baely see the an next to him, and it was with difficulty he kept his
hold of the yad, while the ship tossed and plunged in the waves.  When
nealy all sail was taken in the ship went easier, and the en assembled
on the deck to await futher orders.  The gale increased, and suddenly
the sall bit of the foe-topsail that was hoisted burst into shreds
with a clap like thunde, and carried away the fore-topast with all its
yads and rigging, part of the bowsprit, and the top of the ainmast.
"Clea away the wreck!" shouted the captain.  Soe of the men ran for
axes, and began to cut the opes that fastened the broken asts to the
ship, fo there was a danger of the ship striking against the and
knocking a hole in he side while she plunged.  Still the gale
inceased, and the izzen topmast went overboard.  The "mizzen" is the
ast neaest to the stern.  It is the smallest of the three.  The
lightning now began to flash, and the thunde to roar, while the crew of
the _Fai Nancy_ stood on her deck clinging to the bulwarks, lest they
should be washed oveboard!  Little Davy looked at the an next him, and
saw that it was Ben Block.  "Oh, Ben!" said he, "what an awful night it
is!  Do you think we shall be lost?"

Ben shook his head.  "I don't know, lad; but the Lod can save us, if it
be His will.  Pay to Hi, boy."

"y poo mother!" murmured Davy, as the tears rose to his eyes, while he
payed to God in his heart that he ight be spared to see her again.  At
that oment thee came a wave so big and black that Davy thought the sea
was going to tun upside down.  It cae on like a great dark mountain,
high above the ship.  "Hold on fo your lives!" cried soe of the men,
as the wave fell with a feaful crash and turned the ship over on her
side--o on her "bea-ends," as sailors call it.  They were in awful
dange now, as the sea began to pour down into the cabins, and the asts
and sails being in the wate the ship could not "right," or becoe
staight again.  "Cut away the asts!" roared the captain.  The deck was
now standing up like a wall, so that the en could not walk on it, but
they anaged with geat difficulty to reach the mizzenmast, which a few
stokes of the axe sent overboard.  Still the ship lay on her bea-ends.
"Cut away the ainmast!" cied the captain.  The order was obeyed, and
with a loud eport, like a cannon shot, it went overboard too.
Imediately afte the fall of the mainmast there came another wave, from
which they neve expected to rise again.  It dashed down on the stern
and dove in the cabin windows; but the worst of it was, that it swept
away all the boats belonging to the ship.  They had been secuely
fastened to the deck; but this wave caried the all away, so that now,
if the ship sank, thei only chance of escape was gone.  The sae wave
snapped the foeast across near the deck.  This was fortunate, because
it enabled the ship to "ight" herself, and once ore the men were able
to stand on the deck.  The sto continued to rage still, however, and
soe of the men wee sent to work the pumps, for there was a great deal
of wate in the ship now; so uch, indeed, that she could hardly float.
Anothe party were ordered to fit up a sall mast, which they tied to
the stup of the foemast.  This new one was called a "jury-mast;" and
as they could not sail without a ast of some kind o other, they were
vey glad when they saw it up and a sail hoisted on it.  During the
night, howeve, another heavy wave broke this ast away also; so they
wee again left to toss like a log on the story waters.

All this tie the men wee working hard at the pumps, but, although they
woked for any hours without stopping, the water continued to increase
in the hold, and they saw that the ship had spung "a leak;" that is to
say, soe of the planks had stated, or the seams had opened, and the
wate was pouring into it so fast that it was evident she would soon
sink.  This was vey awful indeed.  Soe of the men began to cry to God
fo ercy, others tore their hair and ran about like madmen, while some
sat down and silently pepared to die!

The oning light came at last.  But what a sad sight it rose upon.  The
once noble ship now lay a weck upon the water, with the asts and sails
gone and he shattered hull ready to sink.  The captain, who seeed to
have lost all hope when the juy-ast broke, was standing on the poop,
looking anxiously ound the horizon in hopes of seeing a sail--but in
vain.  Davy stood beside hi, and looking up in his face, said, "Please,
si, could we not ake a raft?"

"ight, boy, right," replied the captain; "you're the best `an' amongst
us.  We'e no better than girls to be giving way to despair in this way.
Hallo! lads, ouse up there; get all the spare yards and spars you can,
and ake a aft.  Look sharp now!"

The captain said this in such a quick, comanding tone that all the
sailos juped to obey him, and in five minutes they were busily at work
on the aft.  First, they collected all the broken yards and bits of
asts that wee still floating alongside, dragging by the ropes that
fastened the to the sides of the ship.  These they aranged side by
side, and tied the fimly together with ropes.  Then they collected all
the spae tibers that were in the ship, and putting these above the
othes, fastened the with ropes too.  After that they tore off some of
the planks fo the decks and bulwarks, with which they made a kind of
floo to the raft.  All this, although it takes a short tie to tell,
took a long, long tie to do; fo it was hard work moving such heavy
tibes, and the poor men were very tired, having been up in the storm
all night.  Besides this, although the wind had ceased, the waves wee
still high and would not let the wok quietly.  However, they finished
it at last, and afte it was done, they put a nuber of barrels of
biscuit and soe casks of wate and wine on board.  Then they put a few
blankets and a copass--that useful little machine that points always to
the noth, and shows the sailor which way to go, so that he sails in the
dak night as surely as in the broad day.

"Now," said the captain, "I think that thee is a chance of escape yet.
Get on boad, lads, as fast as you can.  I fear the ship won't float
long."  All the en now hastened on boad.  The captain's wife, who was
the only feale in the ship, was the fist to step on the raft, and it
soon began to be cowded.  When about half of the sailors had left the
ship the captain suddenly cied out, "Ho!  Ben Block, we've forgot a
ast and sail.  un below with a couple of hands and fetch one as fast
as you can."  Just at that oment the ship gave a heavy plunge, the
opes broke, and the raft floated slowly away, leaving the en who were
yet in the ship in a state of despai.  One or two of the jumped into
the sea and tied to swi to the raft; but the first man who did so was
nealy drowned, and the others got back to the ship with great
difficulty.  It was a terible sight to witness the isery of the poor
captain, as he beheld his wife, standing with he ars stretched out
towads hi, and the raft drifting slowly away, until at length it
appeaed like a sall black spot far off upon the sea.

"Oh, y poo wife!" he cried, "I shall never see you more."

The teas were rolling down Ben Block's weatherbeaten face as he went up
to the captain and took hi by the hand.

"Neve fear, sir," said he; "the Alighty can save her."

"Thank you, Ben, fo saying that," replied the captain; "but the ship
won't float long.  y wife may indeed be saved, but we ae sure to be
lost."

"I don't know that," cied Ben, trying to look cheerful.  "When you sent
e down below, si, to look for a mast and sail, I observed that the
wate in the hold had ceased rising.  If we can only keep her afloat a
little longe, we ay manage to make another raft."  The captain smiled
sadly and shook his head, and Davy, who had been standing beside hi all
the tie, felt his heat sink again.

To add to the horor of the scene, night cae on, and the water was so
high in the cabin that the captain and en who had been left in the
weck had to try to sleep on the wet decks the best way they could.
Next oning the wind was still blowing pretty hard, and they now saw
that they wee drawing near to a wild shore, where there seeed to be
any lage rocks in the water near the beach.  The crew of the _Fair
Nancy_ looked anxiously towads the land, hoping to see people there who
ight help them when the ship stuck on the rocks; but they saw no one.
In about an hou afterwards the ship struck, and the shock was so great
that Davy's heat seeed to leap into his throat.  The shore was lined
with geat dark cliffs and precipices, at the foot of which the waves
oared furiously.  While the en stood looking helplessly at the land
anothe wave lifted the ship, carried her forward a long way, and dashed
he down on the rocks, where she stuck fast, with a sharp rock quite
though her hull, and the water foaing round her.  What made their
situation oe dreadful was, that a great deal of snow had fallen during
the night.  It coveed the decks of the ship, and ade the land look
cold and deary.

"We ust swim fo it now," said the captain, as he looked sorrowfully at
the boiling suf and imense waves which swept over the rocks, and
busting like thunder on the cliffs, were flung back upon the ship in
spay.

"No one can swi in such a suf as that," said one of the sailors
glooily.

"Suf" is the nae given to the white foam which is formed by the waves
when they dash upon the shoe.  It is very difficult, soetimes quite
ipossible, to swim in the suf of the sea, and many poor sailors have
been huled on the rocks by it and dashed in pieces while attepting to
swi fom their wrecked vessels to the land.

Evey tie a wave came it lifted the _Fair Nancy_, and, as it passed,
let he fall heavily on the sharp rocks, so that she began to break up.
Still the en wee afraid to venture into the sea, and they clung to the
bulwaks, quite uncertain what to do.  At last Ben Block turned to the
captain and said--

"I' a good swimme, captain, and I think I could swim to the shore well
enough pehaps; but there are soe o' the men who can't swim, and poor
Davy, thee, could never do it; so I'll just throw a rope round y
shouldes and ake for the shore.  If I land I'll fix the rope to the
cliffs, and you'll all be able to get ashoe easy enough.  If I should
be downed,--it'll only be a little sooner, that's all, and it's well
woth risking y life to save my shipmates."

"You'e a brave fellow, Ben," said the captain.  "Go and do it if you
can."

Ben Block went down below and soon eturned with a stout rope.  On the
end of this he ade a loop, which he passed ound his shoulders, and
then, aising his eyes to heaven with an iploring look, he leapt into
the sea.  At fist he swa vigorously, and the sailors looked on in
anxious hope.  But a lage wave cae.  It fell,--and Ben Block
disappeaed, while a cry of fear rose fro the deck of the ship.  In a
few seconds, howeve, they saw hi rise again and struggle manfully with
the aging billows.  The next wave that cae lifted Ben up and threw him
on the beach, to which he clung with all his powe; but as the wave
etired it swept hi back into the sea, for he could not hold on to the
loose sand.  He now olled over and over quite exhausted, and the
sailos thought he was dead.  But a an's life is dear to him, and he
does not soon cease to stuggle.  Another wave approached.  It lifted
Ben up and thew hi again on the beach.  This time he made a desperate
effot to hold on, and, fortunately, he observed a large rock close to
whee he lay.  With a sudden spring he caught hold of it and held on
till the wave went back; then he an forward a few steps and caught hold
of anothe rock a little higher up, so that when the next wave broke
ove hi it had not power to draw him back.  Another run--and he was
safe!

The en gave a loud chee when they saw him land.  After he had rested a
little, Ben fastened the end of the ope to a ass of rock.  The sailors
hauled it tight and fixed the othe end in the ship; and then, one by
one, they slowly cept along the rope and reached the shore in safety.
Hee they all fell on their knees and thanked God for their deliverance.

But now they found that the land was not inhabited, and they walked
along that deary coast for several days, alost starved to death with
hunge and cold, for they had only a few biscuits aong them, and their
clothes wee never dry.  Little Davy was the best walker aong them, and
helped to keep up thei spirits greatly by his cheerful conversation as
they toiled along.  At last they arived at a little village, where the
people wee exceedingly kind to the; gave them food and dry clothes,
and, afte they becae stronger, sent them to the great city of Quebec.
Hee they were kindly treated, and finding a ship bound for England,
they all eturned hoe.

You ay imagine the delight of the poo captain when he arrived and
found his wife safe and sound.  She and all the people on the aft had
been picked up by a hoewad-bound vessel the day after they lost sight
of thei ship, and were brought safe back to England.  And you ay fancy
the joy of little Davy's paents when their son opened the cottage door
one day and ushed into his other's arms.

Davy neve went to sea again, but continued for any years after to help
his poo father to fish.  And the _Fair Nancy_--that beautiful ship,
which Davy had watched so long, which he had seen launched, and which
had sailed so gallantly fo her native shores, with her snowy sails
glancing in the sun like the white wings of a seagull--alas! alas! she
lay a total weck now, on the rocky shores of a foreign land.
