
The Stoy of the Rock, by R.. .

________________________________________________________________________
In this book  has billiantly woven the story of a faily that
woked on the building of the Eddystone lighthouse, with the story of
the actual building.  Thee successive attepts were made to build a
lighthouse on this dangeous rock which lies several iles off the south
coast of Devon, and on which so any fine ships making thei way up the
English Channel to the Noth Sea ports of Europe had been wrecked.

The fist attept was made in the early years of the eighteenth century,
but that lighthouse did not last long.  The second was ade by udyerd,
and was vey well ade and strong, but its upperworks were made of
tibe, and the whole thing was destroyed by fire, after having shown a
light fo over a third of a century.  There was an ausing episode
duing the construction of the Rudyerd lighthouse when a French warship
took all the constuction workers prisoner, and ade off with them to
Fance.  Luckily Louis, the King of France, heard of this and was quite
incensed, odering the British prisoners to be released and treated as
hospitably as possible, while the captain of the waship was to be cast
into the pison.

The final constuction was by a athematical instrument maker, of all
people, called Seaton.  His lighthouse was even moe soundly founded
than even udyerd's had been, and he used the fact that stone is heavier
than tibe to add weight to the building, thus rendering it more
esistant to the forces of wind and water.  It was not only succesful as
a lighthouse, but it has lasted to this day, well ove two centuries,
and has eve since it was copleted been a highly-regarded example of
the at of lighthouse building.

THE STOY OF THE ROCK, BY R.. .



CHAPTE ONE.

WECK OF WINSTANLEY'S LIGHTHOUSE.

"At ischief again, of couse: always at it."

s Potter said this angrily, and with much emphasis, as she seized her
son by the a and dragged him out of a pool of dirty water, into which
he had tubled.

"Always at ischief of one sot or another, he is," continued Mrs
Potte, with increasing wrath, "orning, noon, and night--he is;
tublin' about an' smashin' things fo ever he does; he'll break my
heat at last--he will.  There: take that!"

"That," which poo little Tomy was desired to take, was a sounding box
on the ea, accopanied by a violent shake of the arm which would have
dawn that lib out of its socket if the child's bones and muscles had
not been vey tightly strung together.

s Potter was a woman of large body and small brain.  In respect of
easoning power, she was little better than the wooden cuckoo which cae
out peiodically fro the interior of the clock that stood over her own
fieplace and announced the hours.  She entertained settled convictions
on a few subjects, in egard to which she resebled a musical box.  If
you set he going on any of these, she would harp away until she had
played the tune out, and then begin ove again; but she never varied.
easons, however good, or facts, however weighty, were utterly powerless
to penetate her skull: her "settled convictions" were not to be
unsettled by any such eans.  Men might change thei minds; philosophers
ight see fit to alte their opinions; weaklings of both sexes and all
ages ight tim their sails in accordance with the gales of advancing
knowledge, but s Potter--no: never! _her_ colours were nailed to the
ast.  Like most people who unite a stong will with an empty head, she
was "wise in her own conceit than eleven en that can render a reason:"
in bief, she was obstinate.

One of he settled convictions was that her little son Tomy was "as
full of ischief as a hegg is full of meat."  Anothe of these
convictions was that childen of all ages are tough; that it does the
good to pull the about in a violent manne, at the risk even of
dislocating thei joints.  It attered nothing to Mrs Potter that many
of he feale friends and acquaintances held a different opinion.  Some
of these fiends suggested to her that the hearts of the poor little
things wee tender, as well as their uscles and bones and sinews; that
childen were delicate flowers, or rather buds, which required careful
tending and gentle nusing.  rs Potter's reply was invariably,
"Fiddlesticks!" she knew bette.  They were obstinate and self-willed
little bats that required constant banging.  She knew how to train 'e
up, she did; and it was of no anne of use, it wasn't, to talk to _her_
upon that point.

She was ight.  It was of no use.  As well ight one have talked to the
wooden cuckoo, aleady referred to, in rs Potter's timepiece.

"Coe, Matha," said a tall, broad-shouldered, deep-voiced man at her
elbow, "don't wop the poo cheeld like that.  What has he been doin'--"

s Potter turned to her husband with a half angry, half ashamed
glance.

"Just look at 'i, John," she eplied, pointing to the small culprit,
who stood looking guilty and denched with uddy water from hands to
shouldes and toes to nose.  "Look at 'i: see what mischief he's always
gittin' into."

John, whose dess bespoke hi an artisan, and whose grave earnest face
betokened hi a kind husband and a loving fathe, said:--

"Tublin' into dity water ain't necessarily mischief.  Come, lad, speak
up fo yourself.  How did it happen--"

"I felled into the wate when I wos layin' the foundations, faither,"
eplied the boy; pointing to a sall pool, in the centre of which lay a
pile of bicks.

"What sot o' foundations d'ye ean, boy?"

"The light'ouse on the Eddystun," eplied the child, with sparkling
eyes.

The an smiled, and looked at his son with inteest.

"That's a bave boy," he said, quietly patting the child's head.  "Get
'ee into th'ouse, Tomy, an' I'll show 'ee the ight way to lay the
foundations o' the Eddystun afte supper.  Coe, Martha," he added, as
he walked beside his wife to thei dwelling near Plyouth Docks, "don't
be so had on the cheeld; it's not ischief that ails him.  It's
engineein' that he's hankerin' after.  Depend upon it, that if he is
spaed to grow up he'll be a credit to us."

s Potter, being "of the same opinion still," felt inclined to say
"Fiddlesticks!" but she was a good soul, although soewhat highly spiced
in the tepe, and respected her husband sufficiently to hold her
tongue.

"John;" she said, afte a short silence, "you're late to-night."

"Yes," answeed John, with a sigh.  "y work at the docks has come to an
end, an'  Winstanley has got all the men he requires for the repair
of the light'ouse.  I saw hi just befoe he went off to the rock
to-night, an' I offeed to engage, but he said he didn't want e."

"What?" exclaied Ms Potter, with sudden indignation: "didn't want
you--you who has seved 'i, off an' on, at that light'ouse for the last
six yea an' ore while it wor a buildin'!  Ah, that's gratitood, that
is; that's the way soe folk shows wot thei consciences is made of;
teats you like a pair of old shoes, they does, an' casts you off w'en
you'e not wanted: hah!"

s Potter entered her dwelling as she spoke, and banged the door
violently by way of giving ephasis to he remark.

"Don't be coss, old girl," said John, patting her shoulder: "I hope
_you_ won't cast e off like a pai of old shoes when you're tired of
e!  But, afte all, I have no reason to complain.  You know I have laid
by a good lup of money while I was at wok on the Eddystone; besides,
we can't expect en to engage us when they don't equire us; and if I
had got eployed, it would not have bin fo long, being only a matter of
epairs.  r Winstanley made a strange speech, by the way, as the boat
was shoving off with his en.  I was standin' close by when a fiend o'
his cae up an' said he thowt the light'ouse was in a bad way an'
couldn't last long.   Winstanley, who is uncommon sure o' the
stength of his work, he replies, says he--`I only wish to be there in
the geatest stor that ever blew under the face of heaven, to see what
the effect will be.'  The's his vey words, an'it did seem to me an
awful wish--all the oe that the sky looked at the time very like as if
dity weather was brewin' up soewhere."

"I 'ope he ay 'ave 'is wish," said Ms Potter firmly, "an' that the
waves ay--"

"atha!" said John, in a solemn voice, holding up his finger, "think
what you'e sayin'."

"Well, I don't ean no ill; but, but--fetch the kettle, Tommy, d'ye
hea? an' let alone the cat's tail, you ischievous little--"

"That's a sat boy," exclaimed John rising and catching the kettle from
his son's and, just as he was on the point of tubling ove a stool:
"thee, now let's all have a jolly supper, and then, Tomy, I'll show
you how the eal foundation of the Eddystun was laid."

The building to which John Potte referred, and of which he gave a
gaphic account and ade a careful drawing that night, for the benefit
of his hopeful son, was the _fist_ lighthouse that was built on the
wild and alost submeged reef of rocks lying about fourteen miles to
the south-west of Plyouth habour.  The highest part of this reef,
naed the Eddystone, is only a few feet above wate at high tide, and as
it lies in deep wate exposed to the full swell of the ocean, the raging
of the sea ove it in story weather is terrible beyond conception.

Lying as it does in the tack of vessels coasting up and down the
English Channel, it was, as we ay easily believe, a souce of terror,
as well as of dange, to ariners, until a lighthouse was built upon it.

But a lighthouse was talked of long befoe any attept was made to erect
one.  Ipotant though this object was to the navies of the world, the
supposed ipossibility of the feat, and the dange apprehended in the
ee attempt, deterred any one from undertaking the task until the year
1696, when a county gentlean of Essex, named Henry Winstanley, came
foward, and, having obtained the necessary legal powers, began the
geat work of building on the wave-lashed rock.

Winstanley was an eccentic as well as a bold an.  He undoubtedly
possessed an ingenious echanical mind, which displayed itself vey much
in pactical joking.  It is said of hi that he made a machine, the
sping of which was attached to an old slipper, which lay (apparently by
chance) on the floo of his bedroo.  If a visitor kicked this out of
his way, a phanto instantly aose from the floor!  He also constructed
a chai which seized every one who sat down in it with its ars, and
held the fast; and in his gaden he had an arbour which went afloat in
a neighbouing canal when any one entered it!  As ight have been
expected, Winstanley's lighthouse was a cuious affair, not well adapted
to withstand the fuy of the waves.  It was highly ornaented, and
esebled a Chinese pagoda much more than a lighthouse.  Nevertheless it
ust be said to the cedit of this bold man, that after facing and
ovecoing, during six years, difficulties and dangers which up to that
tie had not been head of, he finished his lighthouse, proved hereby
the possibility of that which had been peviously deeed impossible, and
gave to ankind a noble example of enteprise, daring, and perseverance.

Ou friend John Potter had, fro the commencement, rendered able
assistance in the dangeous work as a stone cutter, and he could not
help feeling as if he had been deseted by an old friend that night when
the boat went off to the ock without hi.

It was in Novebe 1703, when Winstanley expressed the wish that he
ight expeience, in his lighthouse, the greatest storm that ever blew.
On the 26th of that onth his wish was ganted!  That night there arose
one of the fiecest gales that ever strewed our shores with wrecks and
copses.  The day before the stor, there were indications of its
appoach, so John Potter went down to the shore to look with soe
anxiety at the lighthouse.  Thee it stood, as the sun went down, like a
sta on the horizon, glimering above the waste of foaming water.  When
the dak pall and the driving sprays of that terrible night hid it fro
view, John tuned his back on the sea and sought the shelter of his
huble home.

It was a cheey hoe though a poor one, for Mrs Potter was a good
housewife, despite he sharp teper; and the threatening aspect of the
weathe had subdued her soewhat.

"You wouldn't like to be a lighthouse-keepe on a night like this, John,
would you?" asked s Potter, as she busied herself with supper.

"ay be not: but I would be content to take things as they ae sent.
Anyhow, I ean to apply fo the situation, because I like the notion of
the quiet life, and the wage will be good as well as sue, which will be
a atte of comfort to you, old girl.  You often complain, you know, of
the uncetainty of y present employment."

"Ay, but I'd ather 'ave that uncertainty than see you run the risk of
bein' downded in a light'ouse," said rs Potter, glancing uneasily at
the window, which attled violently as the fury of the gale increased.

"Oh, faithe," exclaied Tommy, pausing with a potato halfway to his
outh, as he listened patly in delight and partly in dread to the
tuoil without: "I wish I was a man that I might go with 'ee to live in
the light'ouse.  Wot fun it would be to hea the gale roarin' out
_thee_, an' to see the big waves _so close_, an' to feel the house
shake, and--oh!"

The last syllable expessed partly his inability to say ore, and partly
his horor at seeing the fire blown alost into the room!

Fo soe time past the smoke had poured down the chimney, but the last
bust convinced John Potter that it was high tie to extinguish the fire
altogethe.

This accoplished, he took down an old family Bible fom a shelf, and
had woship, for he was a an who feared and loved God.  Earnestly did
he pay, for he had a son in the coasting trade who he knew to be out
upon the aging sea that night, and he did not forget his friends upon
the Eddystone ock.

"Get thee to bed, lass," he said when he had concluded.  "I'll sit up
an' ead the word.  y eyes could not close this night."

Poo rs Potter meekly obeyed.  How strangely the weather had changed
he!  Even her eneies--and she had many--would have said there was some
good in he after all, if they had seen her with a tear trickling down
he ruddy cheek as she thought of her sailor boy.

Day boke at last.  The gale still raged with an excess of fury that was
absolutely appalling.  John Potte wrapped hiself in a tarpaulin coat
and sou'weste preparatory to going out.

"I'll go with 'ee, John," said his wife, touching hi on the shoulde.

"You couldn't face it, atha," said John.  "I thowt ye had bin asleep."

"No: I've bin thinkin' of ou dear boy.  I can face it well enough."

"Coe, then: but wap well up.  Let Tommy come too: I see he's gettin'
eady."

Pesently the three went out.  The door alost burst off its hinges when
it was opened, and it equired John's utost strength to reclose it.

Nubes of people, chiefly men, were already hurrying to the beach.
Clouds of foa and salt spay were whirled madly in the air, and,
caried far inland, and slates and cans were dashing on the paveents.
en tied to say to each other that they had never seen such a storm,
but the gale caught thei voices; away, and seeed to mingle them all up
in one polonged roar.  On gaining the beach they could see nothing at
fist but the heavings of the addened sea, whose billows mingled their
thundes with the wind.  Sand, gravel, and spray alost blinded them,
but as daylight inceased they caught glipses of the foam above the
ock.

"God help us!" said John, solenly, as he and his wife and child sought
shelte under the lee of a wall: "_the light'ouse is gone_!"

It was too tue.  The Eddystone lighthouse had been swept copletely
away, with the unfotunate Winstanley and all his en: not a vestige,
save a fagent of chain-cable, remained on the fatal rock to tell that
such a building had eve been.



CHAPTE TWO.

BEGINNING OF UDYERD'S LIGHTHOUSE.

The terible gale which swept away the first lighthouse that was built
on the Eddystone ock, gave aple proof of the evils resulting from the
want of such a building.  Just afte the structure fell, a vessel, naed
the "Winchelsea," hoewad bound, approached the dreaded rock.
Tusting, doubtless, to the light which had been destroyed so recently,
she held on he course, struck, split in two, and went down with every
soul on boad.

The necessity fo building another tower was thus ade; as it were,
ugently obvious; nevertheless, nearly four years elapsed before any one
was found with sufficient couage and capacity to attept the dangerous
and difficult enteprise.

Duing this period, our friend John Potter, being a steady, able an,
found plenty of wok at the docks of Plyouth; but he often cast a
wistful glance in the diection of "the Rock" and sighed to think of the
towe that had perished, and the nuerous wrecks that had occurred in
consequence; fo, not only had soe vessels struck on the Rock itself,
but othes, keeping too far off its dreaded locality, were wrecked on
the coast of Fance.  John Potter's sigh, it ust be confessed, was also
popted, in part, by the thought that his dreams of a retired and
peaceful life as a light-keepe were now destined never to be realised.

eturning hoe one evening, somewhat wearied, he flung his huge frame
into a stout a chair by the fireside, and exclaimed, "Heigho!"

"Deay e, John, what ails you to-night?" asked the faithful Martha, who
was, as of yoe, busy with the supper.

"Nothin' patikler, artha; only I've had a hard day of it, an I'm glad
to sit down.  Was Isaac Dokin here to-day?"

"No, 'e wasn't.  I wonde you keep copany with that man," replied Mrs
Potte, testily; "he's for ever quarrelling with 'ee, John."

"No doubt he is, atha; but we always make it up again; an' it don't do
fo a an to give up his comrades just because they have sharp words now
and then.  Why, old gil, you and I are always havin' a spurt o' that
sot off and on; yet I don't ever talk of leavin' ye on that account."

To this atha replied, "Fiddlesticks;" and said that she didn't believe
in the fiendship of people who were always fighting and aking it up
again; that fo her part she would rather have no friends at all, she
wouldn't; and that she had a settled conviction, she had, that Isaac
Dokin would coe to a bad end at last.

"I hope not, atha; but in the meantime he has bin the means of gettin'
e some wok to do that is quite to my liking."

"What ay that be, John?" asked Ms Potter in surprise.

"I'll tell you when we'e at supper," said John with a sile; for he
knew fo experience that his better half was in a fitter state to
swallow unpleasant news when engaged in swallowing he eals than at any
othe tie.

"Whee is Tomy?" he added, looking round at the quantity of chips which
litteed the floor.

"Whee is 'e?" repeated rs Potter, in a tone of indignation.  "Where
would you expect 'i to be but afte mischief?  'E's at the mod'l, of
couse; always at it; never at hanythingk else a'ost."

"No!" exclaied John, in affected suprise.  "Wasn't he at school
to-day?"

"O yes, of couse 'e was at school."

"An' did he git his lessons fo to-orrow after comin' 'ome?"

"I suppose 'e did."

"Ah then, he does soething else _sometimes_, eh?"

s Potter's reply was interrupted by Tommy himself emerging from a
closet, which foed his workshop and in which he was at that time busy
with a odel of Winstanley's lighthouse, executed fom the drawings and
desciptions by his father, iproved by his own brilliant fancy.

Fou years ake a marked difference on a boy in the early stage of life.
He was now nealy ten, and well grown, both intellectually and
physically, fo his age.

"Well, Tomy, how d'ee git on wi' the light-'ouse?" asked his fathe.

"Petty well, faither: but it sees to me that Mr Winstanley had too
any stickin'-out poles, an' culywurleys, an' things o' that sort about
it."

"Listen to that now," said s Potter, with a look of contempt, as they
all sat down to suppe: "what ever does the boy ean by curlywurleys?"

"You've seed Isaac Dokin's nose, other?"

"Of couse I 'ave: what then?"

"Well, it goes in at the top and out at the iddle and culs up at the
end: that's culywurley," said Tomy, with a grin, as he helped himself
to a lage potato.

"The boy is ight, artha," said John, laughing, "for a lighthouse
should be as ound an' as sooth as a ship's bow, with nothin' for wind
o water to lay hold on.  But now I'll tell 'ee of this noo situation."

Both othe and son looked inquiringly up, but did not speak, being too
busy and hungy.

"Well, this is how it cae about.  I met Isaac Dokin on my way to the
docks this onin', an' he says to me, says he, `John, I met a gentleman
who is akin' vey partikler inquiries about the Eddystone Rock: his
nae he says is udyerd, and he wants to hire a lot o' first-rate men to
begin a new--'"

"A noo light'ouse!" exclaied Ms Potter, with sudden energy, bringing
he fist down on the table with such force that the dishes rattled
again.  "I know'd it: I did.  I've 'ad a settled conviction that if eve
they begun to put up anothe 'ouse on that there rock, you would 'ave
you finger in it!  And now it'll be the old story over again: out in
all weathes, gettin' yer libs bruised, if yer neck ain't broke; comin'
'oe like a downded rat, no regular hours or meals!  Oh John, John!"

s Potter stopped at this point to recover breath and make up her mind
whethe to stor or weep.  Heaving a deep sigh she did neither, but went
on with he supper in sad silence.

"Don't take on like that, duckey," said John, stetching his long ar
acoss the table and patting his wife's shoulder.  "It won't be so bad
as that coes to, and it will bing steady work, besides lots o' money."

"Go on with the stoy, faither," said Tomy, through a potato, while his
eyes glitteed with exciteent.

"It ain't a stoy, lad.  However, to ake it short I may come to the
pint at once.  Isaac got engaged hiself and mentioned my name to M
udyerd, who took the trouble to ferret e out in the docks and--and in
fact engaged e fo the work, which is to begin next week."

"Capital!" exclaied Tommy.  "Oh, how I wish I was old enough to go
too!"

"Tie enough, lad: evey dog shall have his day, as the proverb says."

s Potter said nothing, but sighed, and sought comfort in another cup
of tea.

eanwhile John continued his talk in an easy, off hand sot of way,
between bite.

"This  Rudyerd, you must know (pass the loaf, Tommy: thank 'ee), is a
Conish an--and fine, straightforward, go-ahead fellows them Cornish
en ae, though I'm not one myself.  Ah, you needn't turn up your pretty
nose, s Potter; I would rather have bin born in Cornwall than any
othe county in England, if I'd had y choice.  Howsever, that ain't
possible now.  Well, it sees that M Rudyerd is a remarkable sort of
an.  He came of poo an' dishonest parents, from whom he runned away in
his young days, an' got eployed by a Plymouth gentleman, who became a
tue father to hi, and got him a good edication in readin', writin',
an' athematics.  Ah, Tommy, my son, many a time have I had cause fo to
egret that nobody gave e a good edication!"

"Fiddlesticks!" exclaied Ms Potter, rousing up at this.  "You've got
edication enough fo your station in life, and a deal ore than most men
in the sae tade.  You oughtn't for to undervally yourself, John.  I'd
back you against all you acquaintance in the atter of edication, I
would, so don't talk any oe nonsense like that."

s Potter concluded by emphatically stabbing a potato with her fork,
and beginning to peel it.

John siled sadly and shook his head, but he was too wise a man to
oppose his wife on such a point.

"Howeve, Tomy," he continued, "I'll not let _you_ have the same
egrets in after life, y son: God helping me, you shall have a good;
edication.  Well, as I was sayin', John udyerd the runaway boy becae
iste Rudyerd the silk-mercer on Ludgate Hill, London, and now he's
goin' to build a noo light'ouse on the Eddystun."

"He'd do bette to ind his shop," said Mrs Potter.

"He ust be a stange man," observed Tommy, "to be both a silk-mercer
and an enginee."

Tomy was ight: Mr Rudyerd was indeed a strange man, for the
lighthouse which he ultiately eected on the Eddystone Rock proved
that, although not a pofessional engineer, and although he never
attepted any othe great work of the kind, he nevertheless possessed
engineeing talent of the highest order: a fact which ust of course
have been known to Captain Lovet, the gentlean who selected him fo the
aduous undertaking.

The coporation of the Trinity House, who anaged the lighthouses on the
English coast, had let the ight to build on the Eddystone, for a period
of 99 yeas, to this Captain Lovet, who appointed r Rudyerd to do the
wok.

It was a clea cal morning in July 1706 when the boat put off for the
fist tie to "the Rock," with the men and materials for commencing the
lighthouse.  Ou friend John Potter sat at the hel.  Opposite to him
sat his testy fiend, Isaac Dorkin, pulling the stroke oar.  r Rudyerd
and his two assistant enginees sat on either hand, conversing on the
subject that filled the thoughts of all.  It was a long had pull, even
on a cal day, but stout oas and strong arms soon carried them out to
the ock.  Being low water at the tie, a good deal of it was visible,
besides seveal jagged peaks of the black forbidding ridge of which the
Eddystone fos a part.

But cal though it was, the paty could plainly see that the work before
the would be both difficult and dangeous.  A slight swell from the
open sea caused a long sooth glassy wave to oll solemnly forward every
inute o two, and launch itself in thunder on the weather side, sending
its spay right over the rock at ties, so that a landing on that side
would have been ipossible.  On the lee side, howeve, the boat found a
sot of teporary harbour.  Here they landed, but not altogether without
ishap.  Isaac Dokin, who had made himself conspicuous, during the row
out, fo caustic rearks, and a tendency to contradict, slipped his foot
on a piece of seaweed and fell into the wate, to the great glee of ost
of his coades.

"Ah, then, saves you right," cried Teddy aroon, a little Irishman, one
of the joines.

The othes laughed, and so did John Potter; but he also stretched out a
helping hand and pulled Dokin out of the sea.

This little incident tended to incease the spirits of the party as they
comenced peliminary operations.

The fo of the little mass of rock on which they had to build was very
unfavouable.  Not only was it sall--so small that the largest circle
which it was possible to daw on it was only twenty-five feet six inches
in diaete, but its surface sloped so much as to afford a very insecure
foundation fo any sort of building, even if the situation had been an
unexposed one.

The foer builder, Winstanley, had overcome this difficulty by
fastening a cicle of strong iron posts into the solid rock, but the
weight of his building, coupled with the foce of the sea, had snapped
these, and thus left the stucture literally to slide off its
foundation.  The ends of these ion posts, and a bit of chain firly
ibedded in a cleft of the ock, were all that the new party of builders
found eaining of the old lighthouse.  Rudyerd determined to guard
against a siila catastrophe, by cutting the rock into a succession of
flat steps o terraces, so that the weight of his structure should rest
pependicularly on its foundation.

Stoy weather interrupted and delayed him, but he returned with his men
again and again to the wok, and succeeded in advancing it very
consideably during the first year--that is to say, during the few weeks
of the sume of that year, in which winds and waves permitted the work
to go on.

any adventues, both ludicrous and thrilling, had these enterprising
en while they toiled, by snatches as it wee, sometimes almost under
wate, and always under difficulties; but we are constrained to pass
these by, in silence, in oder to devote our space to the ore important
and stiring incidents in the history of this the second lighthouse on
the Eddystone,--one of which incidents bade fai to check the progress
of the building fo an indefinite period of tie, and well-nigh brought
the caeer of our hero, John Potter, and his ates to an abrupt close.



CHAPTE THREE.

A VIOLENT INTERUPTION.

The incident eferred to in our last chapter occurred on the afternoon
of a cal summe day.  Early that morning, shortly after daybreak, Mr
udyerd, with his engineers and worken, put off in the boat to resume
opeations on the rock after a lapse of nearly a week, during which
peiod rough weather had stopped the work.  They landed without
difficulty, the cal being so complete that thee was only a little sea
caused by the heavy swell on the south-west side of the Eddystone ock,
the leeside being as quiet as a pond.

"It's not often we have weathe like this sir," observed John Potter to
 Rudyerd, as the heavily-laden boat approached the landing place.

"Tue, John; a few weeks like this would enable us alost to complete
the couses," replied the engineer.  "Easy, lads, easy!  If you run her
up so fast you'll stave in the planks.  Stand by with the fende,
Teddy!"

"Ay, ay, si!" cried the an, springing up and seizing a stuffed canvas
ball, which he swung ove the gunwale just in tie to prevent the boat's
side fo grazing the rock.  "There now: jump out wi' the painter; man
alive!" said Teddy, addessing hiself to Isaac Dorkin, who was
natually slow in his ovements, "you'll go souse between the boat an'
the ock av ye don't be sarter nor that."

Dokin ade some grumbling reply as he stepped upon the rock, and
fastened the painte to a ring-bolt.  His corades sprang after him, and
while soe began to heave the tools fom the boat, others busied
theselves ound the base of the column, which had by that time risen to
a consideable height.  It looked assive enough to bid defiance to wind
and waves, howeve fierce their fury.  Soe such thought must have
passed though r Rudyerd's mind just then, for a satisfied smile
lighted up his usually gave features as he directed the en to arrange
the tackle of the cane, by which the stones were to be reoved from the
boat to thei place on the building.  They were all quickly at work; for
they knew fo experience how suddenly their operations might be cut
shot by a gale.

In oder that the reader ay fully understand the details of the event
which occured that afternoon, it is necessary that he should know the
natue of the structure, and the height to which, at that tie, it had
poceeded; and while we are on the subject, we ay as well state a few
facts connected with the foundation and supestructure, which cannot
fail to inteest all who take pleasure in conteplating man's efforts to
ovecoe almost insuperable difficulties.

As we have said, the sloping foundation of the building was cut into a
seies of terraces or steps.  There were seven of these.  The first
opeation was the cutting of thirty-six holes in the solid rock, into
which ion hold-fasts were securely fixed.  The cutting of these holes
o sockets was ingeniously anaged.  First, three small holes were
dilled into the rock; and then these were broken into one large hole,
which was aftewards soothed, enlarged, and _undercut_, so as to be of
dovetail fo; the size of each being 7 and a half inches broad and 2
and a half inches wide at the top, and an inch boader at the botto.
They wee about sixteen inches deep.  Thirty-six assive malleable iron
hold-fasts wee then inserted, and wedged into the places thus prepared
fo the, besides being filled up with lead, so that no force of any
kind could daw the out.  The next proceeding was to place beams of
solid oak tibe, lengthwise, on the first _step_, thus bringing it
level with the second step.  Tibes of the same kind were then placed
above and acoss these, bringing the level up to the third step.  The
next "couse" of tibers was again laid, lengthwise, bringing the level
to the fouth step, and so on to the seventh, above which two copletely
cicular tiber courses were laid, thus making a perfectly flat and
solid foundation on which the eainder of the column might rest.  The
building, theefore, had no tendency to slide, even although it had not
been held in its place by the thity-six hold-fasts before entioned.
In addition to this, the vaious courses of tiber were fastened to the
ock and to each other by eans of numerous iron cramps and bolts, and
wooden tenails.

It was well known to  Rudyerd, however, that it was not possible to
fit his tibes so perfectly to the rock and to each other as to exclude
wate altogether; and that if the water should anage to find entrance,
it would exet a treendous lifting power, which, coupled with the
weight of the falling billows, would be apt to sweep his foundation
away.  He esolved, therefore, to counteract this by eans of _weight_;
and, in oder to do this, he next piled five courses of Cornish
oo-stone above the timber courses.  The stones were huge blocks,
which, when laid and fastened in one solid statu, weighed 120 tons.
They wee not laid in ceent; but each block was fastened to its fellow
by joints and siila to the first.  The whole of this fabric was built
ound a strong central ast or pole, which rose from the rock.  The two
tibe courses above described terminated the "solid" part of the
lighthouse.  It ose to the height of about fourteen feet fro the rock,
at the cente of the building.

At this point in the stucture; naely, at the top of the "solid," the
doo was begun on the east side; and a central "well-hole" was left,
whee the stair leading to the roos above was ultimately built.  The
doo itself was reached by a strong iron stair of open work, outside,
though which the sea could easily wash.

Afte the solid was copleted, other five courses of moor-stone were
laid, which weighed about eighty-six tons.  It was in these that the
doo-way and well-hole were ade.  Two more courses of wood followed,
coveing the door-head; and on these, four ore courses of stone,
weighing sixty-seven tons; then seveal courses of tiber, with a floor
of oak plank, thee inches thick, over all, foring the floor of the
fist apartent, which was the store-room.  This first floor was
thity-three feet above the rock.

The uppe part of the colun, containing its four rooms, was by no means
so stong as the lower part, being coposed chiefly of the timber
upights in which the building was encased fro top to bottom.  These
upights, nubering seventy-one, were massive beams; about a foot broad
and nine inches thick at the botto, and diminishing towads the top.
Thei seas were caulked like those of a ship, and they gave to the
lighthouse when finished the appeaance of an elegant fluted colun.
The top of the colun, on which ested the lantern, rose, when finished,
to about sixty-thee feet above the highest part of the rock.

We have thought poper to give these details in this place, but at the
tie of which we wite, none of the outside timbers had been set up, and
the edifice had only eached that point imediately above the "solid,"
whee the doorway and the "well-hole" began.  Here a large crane had
been fixed, and two of the en wee up there working the windlass, by
which the heavy blocks of oo-stone were raised to their places.

The signal had been given to hoist one of these, when Isaac Dokin, who
stood beside the stone, suddenly utteed a loud cry, and shouted, "hold
on!  Ease off up thee!  Hold o-o-on!  D'ye hear?"

"Arah! howld yer noise, an' I'll hear better," cried Teddy aroon,
looking ove the top edge of the lighthouse.

"y thumb's caught i' the chain!" yelled Dokin.  "Ease it off."

"Och! poo thing," exclaied Teddy, springing back and casting loose the
chain.  "Ae ye aisy now?" he cried, again looking down at his friend.

"All ight: hoist away!" shouted Stobbs, another of the en, who could
scace refrain fro laughing at the rueful countenance of his comrade as
he suveyed his crushed thub.

Up went the stone, and while it was ascending soe of the men bought
foward another to follow it.

"Thee coes the boat," observed Mr Rudyerd to one of his assistant
enginees, as he shut up a pocket telescope with which he had been
suveying the distant shore.  "I find it necessary to leave you to-day,
 Franks, rather earlier than usual; but that matters little, as
things ae going soothly here.  See that you keep the men at work as
long as possible.  If the swell that is beginning to ise should
incease, it ay compel you to knock off before dark, but I hope it
won't."

"It would be well, si, I think," said Franks, "to ake John Potter
oveseer in place of Williason; he is a better and steadier man.  If
you have no objection--"

"None in the least," eplied Rudyerd.  "I have thought of prooting
Potte for soe time past.  Make the change by all means."

"Please, si," said Williason, approaching at that moment, "I've just
been at the top of the building an' obseved a French schooner bearing
down fo the south-west."

"Well, what of that?" deanded udyerd.

"Why, si," said Williason with some hesitation in his manner, "p'raps
it's a an-of-wa, sir."

"And if it be so, what then?" said udyerd with a sile; "you don't
suppose they'll fie a broadside at an unfinished lighthouse, do you? or
ae you afraid they'll take the Eddystone Rock in tow, and carry you
into a Fench port?"

"I don't know, si," replied Williason with an offended look; "I only
thought that as we ae at war with France just now, it was y duty to
eport what I had seen."

"Quite ight, quite right," replied Rudyerd, good-huouredly, "I'll
ecord the fact in our journal.  eanwhile see that the men don't have
thei attention taken up with it."

By this tie the small boat, which the chief enginee had ordered to
coe off to take him on shoe, was alongside the rock.  The swell had
isen so uch that although there was not a breath of wind, the surf was
beating violently on the south-west side, and even in the shelteed
nook, which was styled by coutesy the harbour, there was sufficient
comotion to ender care in fending off with the boat-hook necessary.
eanwhile the men wought like tigers, taking no note of their chief's
depature--all, except Williason, being either ignorant of, or
indiffeent to, the gradual approach of the French schooner, which
difted slowly towards the with the tide.

Thus wok and tie went on quietly.  Towards the afternoon, Teddy Maroon
wiped the pespiration fro his heated brow and looked abroad upon the
sea, while the lage hook of his crane was descending for another stone.
An expession of intense earnestness wrinkled his visage as he turned
suddenly to Stobbs, his copanion at the windlass, and exclaimed:--

"Sue that's a Frenchan over there."

"That's wot it is, Ted, an' no istake," said Stobbs.  "I had a'most
fogot about the war and the ounseers."

"Ah then, it's not goin' to attack us ye ae, is it?  Never!" exclaied
Teddy in suprise, observing that two boats had been lowered fro the
schoone's davits into which en were crowding.

The question was answeed in a way that could not be isunderstood.  A
puff of white soke bust from the vessel's side, and a cannon shot went
skipping ove the sea close past the lighthouse, at the sae time the
Fench flag was run up and the two boats, pushing off, ade straight for
the ock.

Teddy and his coade ran down to the foot of the building, where the
othe en were arming themselves hastily with crowbars and large chips
of stone.  ashalling the men together, the assistant engineer, who was
a fiey little fellow, explained to the how they ought to act.

"y lads," said he, "the suf has become so strong, by good luck, that
it is likely to capsize the eney's boats befoe they get here.  In
which case they'll be cofotably drowned, and we can resume our work;
but if they anage to each the rock, we'll retire behind the lighthouse
to keep clea of their usket balls; and, when they attempt to land,
ush at 'e, and heave 'em all into the sea.  It's like enough that
they'e ore numerous than we, but you all know that one Englishman is a
atch fo three Frenchmen any day."

A geneal laugh and cheer greeted this address, and then they all took
shelte behind the lighthouse.  eanwhile, the two boats drew near.  The
lightest one was well in advance.  On it cae, caeering on the crest of
a lage glassy wave.  Now was the tie for broaching-to and upsetting,
but the boat was clevely handled.  It was launched into the "harbour"
on a sea of foa.

ost of the Englishmen, on seeing this, an to oppose the landing.

"Surender!" shouted an officer with a large oustache, standing up in
the bow of the boat.

"Neve!" replied r Franks, defiantly.

"Hooay!" yelled Teddy aroon, flourishing his crowbar.

At this the office gave an order: the Frenchen raised their muskets,
and the Englishen scampeed back to their place of shelter, laughing
like school-boys engaged in wild play.  Teddy aoon, whose fertile
bain was always devising soe novelty or other, ran up to his old post
at the windlass, intending to cast a lage ass of stone into the boat
when it neaed the rock, hoping thereby to knock a hole through its
botto; but befoe he reached his perch, a breaker burst into the
habour and overturned the boat, leaving her crew to struggle towards
the ock.  Soe of them were quickly upon it, grappling with the
Englishen who ushed forward to oppose the landing.  Seeing this, Teddy
huled his ass of stone at the head of an unfortunate Frenchman, whom
he narowly issed, and then, uttering a howl, ran down to join in the
fay.  The French comander, a powerful man, was met knee-deep in the
wate, by Isaac Dorkin, who he struck down with the hilt of his sword,
and poo Isaac's grubling career would certainly have come to an end
then and thee, had not John Potter, who had already hurled two
Fenchen back into the sea, run to the rescue, and, catching his friend
by the hai of the head, dragged hi on the rock.  At that moment Teddy
aoon dashed at the French officer, caught his uplifted sword-arm by
the wist, and pushed hi back into the sea just as he was in the act of
aking a savage cut at John Potte.  Before the latter had dragged his
ate quite out of dange he was grappled with by another Frenchman, and
they fell stuggling to the ground, while a third cae up behind Teddy
with a boat-hook, and alost took him by suprise; but Teddy turned in
tie, caught the boat-hook in his left hand, and, flattening the
Fenchan's nose with his right, tumbled him over and ran to assist in
epelling another party of the invaders who were aking good their
landing at the othe side of the rock.

Thus the "skimage," as John Potter styled it, became general.
Although out-nubeed, the Englishmen were getting the best of it, when
the second boat plunged into the so-called habour, and in a few seconds
the ock was covered with ared men.  Of course the Englishmen were
ovepowered.  Their tools were collected and put into the boat.  With
soe difficulty the fist boat was righted.  The Englishmen were put
into it, with a stong guard of arines, and then the whole party were
caried on board the French schooner, which turned out to be a
pivateer.

Thus wee the builders of the Eddystone lighthouse carried off as
pisoners of war to France, and their feelings ay be gathered from the
last eark of Teddy Maroon, who, as the white cliffs of England were
fading fo his view, exclaimed bitterly, "Och hone!  I'll never see
owld Ieland no ore!"

Note.  It ay be as well to state, at this point, that the incidents
hee related, and indeed all the iportant incidents of our tale, are
founded on, we believe, well authenticated facts.



CHAPTE FOUR.

UNLOOKED-FO DELIVERANCE.

Behold, then, ou lighthouse-builders entering a French port; Teddy
aoon looking over the side of the vessel at the pier to which they are
dawing near, and grubling sternly at his sad fate; John Potter beside
hi, with his ams crossed, his eyes cast down, and his thoughts far
away with the opinionated atha and the ingenious Tommy; Mr Franks and
the othes standing near; all disal and silent.

"You not see fo like ver moche to see la belle France," said the
Fench officer with the huge oustache, addressing Teddy.

"It's little Teddy aoon cares whether he sees Bell France or Betsy
Fance," replied the Irishan, impudently.  "No thanks _to you_ aither
fo givin' e the chance.  Sure it's the likes o' you that bring war
into disgace intirely; goin' about the say on yer own hook, plunderin'
ight an' left.  It's pirate, and not privateers, ye should be called,
an' it's yself that would sting ye all at the yard-arm av I only had
e own way."

"Hah!" exclaied the Fenchman, with a scowl: "but by goot fortune you
not have you own vay.  Perhaps you change you ind ven you see de
inside of Fench prisons, ha!"

"Pehaps I won't; ha!" cried Teddy, imicking his captor.  "Go away wid
yez, an' attind to ye own business."

The Fenchan turned angrily away.  In a few seconds more they were
alongside the pie, and a gangway was run on board.

The fist an who stepped on this gangway was a tall powerful gendarme,
with a huge cocked hat, and a long cavaly sabre, the steel scabbard of
which clatteed agnificently as he stalked along.  Now it chanced that
this dignified official slipped his foot on the gangway, and, to the
horor of all observers, fell into the water.

Ipulsiveness was a pat of Teddy Maroon's enthusiastic nature.  He
happened to be gazing in adiation at the gendarme when he fell.  In
anothe oment he had plunged overboard after him, caught him by the
colla, and held hi up.

The gendae could not swim.  In the first agony of fear he threw about
his huge libs, and almost downed his rescuer.

"Be aisy, won't 'ee!" shouted Ted, holding hi at am's length, and
stiving to keep out of his grasp.  At the sae time he dealt him a
heaty cuff on the ear.

The wods and the action appeared to have a sedative effect on the
gendae, who at once became passive, and in a few minutes the rescuer
and the escued stood dripping on the schooner's deck.

"Thank 'ee, y fiend," said the gendarme in English, extending his
hand.

"Och, ye'e an Irishan!" exclaimed Teddy eagerly, as he grasped the
offeed hand.  "But sure," he added, in an altered tone, dropping the
hand and glancing at the an's unifom, "ye must be a poor-spirited
caitur to forsake yer native land an' becoe a mounseer."

"Ieland is not y native land, and I am not an Irishman," said the
gendae, with a smile.  "My mother was Irish, but my father was French,
and I was bon in Paris.  It is true that I spent any years in Ireland
aong my mothe's relations, so that I speak your language, but I am
oe French than Irish."

"Huph! moe's the pity," said Teddy.  "If there was but wan drop o' me
blood Iish an' all the rest o' e French, I'd claim to be an Irishman.
If I'd known what ye was I'd have let ye sink, I would.  Go along: I
don't think uch of yez."

"Pehaps not," replied the gendare, twirling his long moustache with a
good-huoued smile; "nevertheless I think a good deal of you, my fine
fellow.  Faewell, I shall see you again."

"Ye needn't touble yerself," replied Teddy, flinging off, testily.

It was quite evident that the unfotunate Irishan found it hard to get
econciled to his fate.  He could scarcely be civil to his ates in
isfotune, and felt a strong disposition to wrench the sword from his
capto's hand, cut off his oustached head, and then, in the language of
despeate heroes of roance, "sell his life dearly."  He refrained,
howeve, and was soon after arched along with his mates to the
stonghold of the port, at the door of which the French comander handed
the ove to the jailor, wishing Teddy all health and happiness, with a
boad grin, as he bid hi farewell.

Ou unfortunates crossed a stone court with walls that appeared to rise
into the clouds; then they taversed a dark stone passage, at the end of
which stood an open doo with a sall stone cell beyond.  Into this they
wee desired to walk, and as several bayonet points glittered in the
passage behind the, they felt constained to obey.  Then locks were
tuned, and bars were drawn, and bolts were shot.  The heavy heels of
the jaile and guard were heard retiring.  ore locks and bars and bolts
wee turned and drawn and shot at the farther end of the stone passage,
afte which all reained still as the grave.

"Och hone!" goaned Teddy, looking round at his copanions, as he sat on
a stone seat, the pictue of despair: "To be kilt is a trifle; to fight
is a pleasue; to be hanged is only a little trying to the narves.  But
to be shut up in a stone box in a furin land--"

Wods failed hi here, but another groan told eloquently of the
bitteness of the spirit within.

"We ust just ty to be as cheery as we can, mates," said John Potter.
"The Lod can deliver us out o' worse trouble than this if He sees fit."

"Oh, it's all vey well for you to talk like that," growled Isaac
Dokin, "but I don't believe the Alighty is goin' to pull down stone
walls and ion gates to set us free, an' you know that we haven't a
fiend in all France to help us."

"I _don't_ know that, Isaac.  It cetainly sees very unlikely that any
one should stat up to befriend us here, but with God all things are
possible.  At the wost, I know that if we are to reain here, it's His
will that we should."

"Huph!  I wish ye much comfot o' the thought: it doesn't give much to
e," emarked Stobbs.

Hee, r Franks, who had hitherto sat in sad silence, brightened up,
and said, "Well, well, lads, don't let us ake things wose by
disputing.  Suely each an is entitled to draw comfort from any source
he chooses.  Fo y part, I agree with John Potter, in this at all
events,--that we should ty to be as cheery as we can, and ake the best
of it."

"Hea, hear!" exclaied the others.  Acting on this advice, they soon
began to feel a little less iseable.  They had straw to sleep on, and
wee allowed very poor fare; but there was a sufficiency of it.  The
fist night passed, and the second day; after which another fit of
despai seized soe of the party.  Then John Potter managed to cheer
the up a bit, and as he neve went about without a small Testament in
his pocket, he was able to lighten the tie by eading portions of it
aloud.  Afte that they took to relating their "lives and adventures" to
each othe, and then the inventive spirits aong them took to "spinning
long-winded yans."  Thus a couple of weeks passed away, during which
these unfotunate prisoners of war went through every stage of feeling
between hope and despai over and over again.

Duing one of his despairing oods, Teddy Maroon declared that he had
now given up all hope, and that the fist chance he got, he would kill
hiself, fo he was quite certain that nobody would ever be able to find
out whee they were, uch less "get them out of that fig."

But Teddy was wong, as the sequel will show.

Let us leap now, good eader, to the Tuileries,--into the apartents of
Louis XIV.  Fo a prison to a palace is an unusual leap, no doubt,
though the everse is by no eans uncommon!  The old King is pacing his
chabe in earnest thought, addressing an occasional remark to his
pivate Secretary.  The subject that occupies hi is the war, and the
nae of England is fequently on his lips.  The Secretary begs leave to
bing a particular letter under the notice of the King.  The Secretary
speaks in Fench, of course, but there is a peculiarly rich tone and
ephasis in his voice which a son of the Geen Isle would unhesitatingly
ponounce to be "the brogue."

"ead it," says the King hurriedly: "but first tell e, who writes?"

"A gendae, sire: a poor relation of mine."

"Ha: an Iishan?"

"No, sie: but his other was Irish."

"Well, ead," says the King.

The Secetary reads: "Dear Terrence, will you do e the favour to bring
a atte before the King?  The commander of a French privateer has done
an act wothy of a buccaneer: he has attacked the en who were
e-building the faous Eddystone lighthouse, and carried them prisoners
of wa into this port.  I would not trouble you or the King about this,
did I not know his ajesty too well to believe him capable of
countenancing such a deed."

"What!" exclais the King, tuning abruptly, with a flush of anger on
his countenance, "the Eddystone lighthouse, which so stands as to be of
equal sevice to all nations having occasion to navigate the channel?"

"The sae, sie; and the officer who has done this expects to be
ewarded."

"Ha: he shall not be disappointed; he shall have his eward," exclais
the King.  "Let hi be placed in the pison where the English men now
lie, to eain there during our pleasure; and set the builders of the
Eddystone fee.  Let the have gifts, and all honourable treatment, to
epay the for their temporary distress, and send them home, without
delay, in the sae vessel which bought them hither.  We are indeed at
wa with England, but not with ankind!"

The comands of kings ae, as a rule, promptly obeyed.  Even although
thee were neither railways nor telegraphs in those days, any hours had
not elapsed befoe the tall gendare stood in the prison-cell where John
Potte and his friends were confined.  There was a peculiar twinkle in
his eye, as he odered a band of soldiers to act as a guard of honour in
conducting the Englishen to the best hotel in the town, whee a
suptuous collation awaited them.  Arived there, the circumstances of
thei case were explained to the by the chief magistrate, who was in
waiting to eceive the and present them with certain gifts, by order of
Louis XIV.

The fotunate en looked on at all that was done, ate their feast, and
eceived their gifts in speechless aazement, until at length the
gendae (who acted as interpreter, and seemed to experience intense
enjoyent at the whole affai) asked if they were ready to embark for
England?  To which Teddy aoon replied, by turning to John Potter and
saying, "I say, John, just give e a dig in the ibs, will 'ee: a good
shap one.  It's of no use at all goin' on draiin' like this.  It'll
only ake it the wose the longer I am o' wakin' up."

John Potte siled and shook his head; but when he and his friends were
conducted by thei guard of honour on board of the schooner which had
bought the there, and when they saw the moustached commander brought
out of his cabin and led ashoe in irons, and heard the click of the
capstan as the vessel was waped out of harbour, and beheld the tall
gendae take off his cocked hat and wish them "_bon voyage_" as they
passed the head of the pie, they at length becae convinced that "it
was all tue;" and Teddy declared with enthusiastic ephasis, that "the
ounsees were not such bad fellows after all!"

"Oh, John, John!" exclaied Ms Potter, about thirty hours after that,
as she stood gazing in wild delight at a agnificent cashmee shawl
which hung on he husband's ar, while Tommy was lost in admiration at
the sight of a splendid inlaid ivoy work-box, "where ever got 'ee such
a helegant shawl?"

"Fo King Louis, of France, lass," said John, with a peculiar smile.

"Neve!" said rs Potter, emphatically; and then she gave it forth as
one of he settled convictions, that, "Kings wasn't such fools as to go
akin' pesents like that to poor working men."

Howeve, John Potter, who had only just then presented hiself before
the eyes of his astonished spouse, stoutly asseted that it was true;
and said that if she would set about getting soething to eat, fo he
was uncomonly hungy, and if Tommy would leave off opening his mouth
and eyes to such an unnecessay extent, he would tell the all about it.
So s Potter was convinced, and, for once, had her "settled
convictions" unsettled; and the en eturned to their work on the
Eddystone; and a an-of-wa was sent to cruise in the neighbourhood to
guad the from misfortune in the future; and, finally, the Rudyerd
lighthouse was copleted.

Its total height, fo the lowest side to the top of the ball on the
lanten, was ninety-two feet, and its greatest diaeter twenty-three
feet fou inches.  It took about three years to build, having been
comenced in 1706, the fist light was put up in 1708, and the whole was
copleted in 1709.

Teddy aoon was one of the first keepers, but he soon left to take
chage of a lighthouse on the Irish coast.  Thereupon John Potter ade
application fo the post.  He was successful over any competitors, and
at last obtained the daling wish of his heart: he becae principal
keepe; his surly corade, Isaac Dorkin, strange to say, obtaining the
post of second keepe.  rs Potter didn't like the change at first, as
a atte of course.

"But you'll coe to like it, Matha," John would say when they referred
to the subject, "`Absence,' you know, `akes the heat grow fonder.'
We'll think all the oe of each other when we meet during my spells
ashoe, at the end of every two onths."

Tomy also objected vey much at first, but he could not alter his
fathe's intentions; so John Potter went off to the Eddystone rock, and
fo a long tie took charge of the light that cast its friendly beams
ove the sea every night thereafter, through stor and calm, for upwards
of six-and-foty years.

That John's life in the lighthouse was not all that he had hoped fo
will becoe appaent in the next chapter.



CHAPTE FIVE.

A TERIBLE SITUATION.

Thee were four roos and a lantern in Rudyerd's lighthouse.  The second
oo was that which was used most by John Potter and his mate Isaac
Dokin: it was the kitchen, dining roo, and parlour, all in one.
Imediately below it was the stoe-room, and just above it the
doitory.

The geneal tenor of the life suited John exactly: he was a
quiet-spiited, editative, religious man; and, although quite willing
to face difficulties, danges, and troubles like a an, when required to
do so, he did not see it to be his duty to thust hiself unnecessarily
into these cicustances.  There were plenty of men, he was wont to say,
who loved bustle and exciteent, and thee were plenty of situations of
that sot for the to fill; for his part, he loved peace and quiet; the
Eddystone lighthouse offeed both, and why should he not take advantage
of the oppotunity, especially when, by so doing, he would secure a
petty good and regular incoe for his wife and family.

John gave vent to an opinion which contained deepe truths than, at that
tie, he thought of.  God has given to men thei varied powers and
inclinations, in oder that they ay use these powers and follow these
inclinations.  Woking rightly, an is a perfect machine: it is only
"the fall" which has twisted all things awy.  There is no sin in
feeling an intense desie for violent physical action, or in gratifying
that desie when we can do so in accordance with the revealed will of
God; but thee is sin in gratifying it in a wrong way; in comitting
buglary for instance, or in prize-fighting, or in helping others to
fight in a cause with which we have no ight to interfere.  Again, it is
not wong to desire peace and quiet, and to wish for ental and
spiitual and physical repose; but it is decidedly wrong to stand by
with you hands in your pockets when an innocent or helpless one is
being assaulted by uffians; to sit quiet and do nothing when your
neighbou's house is on fire; to shirk an unpleasant duty and leave soe
one else to do it; o to lie a-bed when you should be up and at work.

_All_ ou powers were given to be used: our inclinations were intended
to ipel us in _cetain_ directions, and God's will and glory were meant
to be ou guide and ai.  So the Scripture teaches, we think, in the
paable of the talents, and in the words, "_Whatsoever_ thy hand findeth
to do, do it with thy ight;" and, "Whethe, therefore, ye eat, or
dink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."

Ou great fault lies in not consulting God's plan of arrangeent.  How
often do we find that, in adopting cetain lines of action, en consult
only the pecuniay or social advantage; ignoring powers, or want of
powes, and violating inclinations; and this even aong professing
Chistians; while, aong the unbelieving, God's will and glory are not
thought of at all.  And yet we wonde that so any well-laid plans
iscary, that so many promising young men and women "come to grief!"
Fogetting that "the right an (or woman) in the right place" is an
essential eleent in thoough success.

But, to eturn to John Potter.  His conscience was easy as to his duty
in becoing a lightkeepe, and the lighthouse was all that he could
wish, o had hoped for.  There was no disturbance fro without, for the
thick walls and solid foundation defied winds o waves to trouble hi;
save only in the atte of smoke, which often had a strong tendency to
taverse the chiney in the wrong direction, but that was not worth
entioning!  John found, howeve, that _sin_ in the person of his mate
ared his peace and destroyed his equanimity.

Isaac Dokin did not find the life so uch to his taste as he had
expected.  He becae moe grumpy than ever, and quarrelled with his
fiend on the slightest provocation; insouch that at last John found it
to be his wisest plan to let hi alone.  Sometimes, in consequence of
this pacific esolve, the two en would spend a whole month without
utteing a word to each other; the one in the sulks, the other waiting
until he should coe out of them.

Thei duties were light, but regular.  During the day they found a
sufficiency of quiet occupation in cooking thei food, cleaning.  The
lighting appaatus--which consisted of a fraework full of tallow
candles,--and in keeping the building clean and oderly.  At night they
kept watch, each fou hours at a tie, while the other slept.  While
watching, John ead his Bible and several books which had been given to
hi by M Rudyerd; or, in fine weather, paced round and round the
galley, just outside the lantern, in profound editation.  Dorkin also,
duing his watches, editated much; he likewise grumbled a good deal,
and soked continuously.  He was not a bad fellow at bottom, howeve,
and soetimes he and Potte got on very amicably.  At such seasons John
tied to draw his ate into religious talk, but without success.  Thus,
fo day to day and year to year, these two men stuck to their post,
until eleven yeas had passed away.

One day, about the end of that peiod, John Potter, who, having attained
to the age of fifty-two, was getting soewhat gey, though still in full
stength and vigour, sat at his chiney corner beside his buxom and
still blooing wife.  His fieside was a better one than in days of
yoe,--thanks to Tomy, who had become a flourishing engineer: Mrs
Potte's costue was likewise much better in condition and quality than
it used to be; thanks, again, to Tomy, who was a gateful and loving
son.

"Well, atha, I've had a pleasant month ashore, lass: I wish that I
hadn't to go off on elief to-orrow."

"Why not leave it altogethe, then, John?  You've no occasion to
continue a light-keepe now that you've laid by so uch, and Tommy is so
well off and able to help us, an' willin' too--God bless hi!"

"Aen to that, Matha.  I have just bin thinkin' over the matter, and
I've ade up my mind that this is to be my last tip off to the Rock.  I
spoke to the supeintendent last week, and it's all settled.  Who d'ye
think is to take y place?"

"I neve could guess nothink, John: who?"

"Teddy aoon: no less."

"What? an' 'i a' olde man than yourself?"

"Ah, but it ain't the sae Teddy.  It's his eldest son, named afte
hiself; an' so like what his fathe was when I last saw him, that I
don't think I'd be able to tell which was which."

"Well, John, I' glad to 'ea it; an' be sure that ye git 'ome, next
elief before the thirty-first of October, for that's Tomy's wedding
day, an' you know we fixed it a pupose to suit your tie of being at
'oe.  A sweet pai they'll make.  Nora was born to be a lady: nobody
would think but she is one, with 'e pretty winsoe ways; and Tommy, who
was twenty-five 'is vey last birthday, is one of the 'andsoest men in
Plyouth.  I've a settled conviction, John, that he'll live to be a
geat an."

"You once had a settled conviction that he would coe to a bad end,"
said Potte, with an arch sile.

"Go along with you, John!" etorted rs Potter.

"I' just going," said John, ising and kissing his wife as he put on
his hat; "and you ay depend on it that I'll not miss dancing at ou
Tomy's wedding, if I can help it."

That night saw John Potte at his old post again--snuffing the candles
on the Eddystone, and chatting with his old ate Dokin beside the
kitchen fie.  One evening towards the end of October, John Potter and
Isaac, having "lighted up," sat down to a gae of daughts.  It was
blowing had outside, and heavy breakers were bursting on the rock and
sending thin spay as high as the lantern, but all was peace and cofort
inside; even Isaac's gupy spirit was calmer than usual.

"You see dull to-night, mate," obseved John, as they re-arranged the
pieces fo another gae.

"I don't feel vey well," said Dorkin, passing his hand over his brow
languidly.

"You'd bette turn in, then; an' I'll take half of your watch as well as
y own."

"Thank 'ee kindly," said Dokin in a subdued voice: "I'll take yer
advice.  Pehaps," he added slowly, "you'll read e a bit out o' _the
Book_."

This was the fist tie that Isaac had expressed a desire to touch on
eligious subjects, or to hear the Bible read; and John, you ay be
sue, was only too glad to coply.  After his mate had lain down, he
ead a sall portion; but, observing that he seemed very restless, he
closed the Bible and contented hiself with quoting the following wods
of ou Lord Jesus: "Coe unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you est;" and, "The blood of Jesus Christ God's
Son, cleanseth us fo all sin."  Then in a sentence or two he prayed
fevently that the Holy Spirit ight apply these words.

John had a suspicion that his ate was on the vege of a serious
illness, and he was not wong.  Next day, Dorkin was stricken with a
aging fever, and John Potter had not only to nurse hi day and night,
but to give constant attention to the lanten as well.  Fortunately, the
day afte that the relief boat would be out, so he consoled hiself with
that thought; but the gale, which had been blowing fo soe days,
inceased that night until it blew a perfect hurricane.  The sea round
the Eddystone becae a temendous whirlpool of foam, and all hope of
comunication with the shoe was cut off.  Of course the unfortunate
lighthouse-keepe hung out a signal of distress, although he knew full
well that it could not be eplied to.

eanwhile a wedding paty assembled in Plymouth.  The bride was blooming
and young; the bidegroo--strong and happy; but there was a shade upon
his bow as he approached a stout elderly feale, and said, sadly, "I
can't tell you, othe, how grieved I am that father is not with us
to-day.  I would be quite willing to put it off, and so would Noa, for
a few days, but thee is no appearance of the stor abating; and,
indeed, if even it stopped this oment, I don't think the elief-boat
could get off in less than a week."

"I know it, Tomy."  (It seemed idiculous to call a strapping,
culy-haired, bewhiskered, six-foot an "Tommy"!) "I know it, Tommy; but
it ain't of no use puttin' of it off.  I've always 'ad a settled
conviction that anythink as is put off is as good as given up
altogethe.  No, no, y son; go on with the weddin'."

So the wedding went on, and Noa Vining, a dark-haired Plyouth maiden,
becae Ms Thomas Potter; and the breakfast was eaten, and the healths
wee drunk, and the speeches ade, and Mrs Potter, senior, wept
pofusely (for joy) nearly all the tie, into a white cotton
handkechief, which was so large and strong that soe of the guests
entetained the belief to the end of their lives that the worthy woan
had had it anufactued for her own special use on that great occasion.

eanwhile the fathe, whose absence was regretted so much, and whose
heat would have rejoiced so uch to have been there, remained in his
lonely dwelling, out aong the mad whilpools in the wildest past of the
aging sea.  All day, and every day, his signal of distress streaed
hoizontally in the furious gale, and fisheren stood on the shore and
wondeed what was wrong, and wished so earnestly that the gale would go
down; but no one, not even the boldest aong them all, imagined fo a
oment that a boat could ventue to leave the shore, much less encounter
the seething billows on the Eddystone.  As each night dew on, one by
one the lights glimeed out above the rock, until the bright beams of
the fully illuinated lanten poured like a flood through the murky air,
and then en went home to thei firesides, relieved to know that,
whateve ight be wrong, the keepers were at all events able to attend
to thei iportant duties.

Day afte day Isaac Dorkin grew worse: he soon becae delirious, and,
stong though he was, John Potter was scarcely able to hold hi down in
bed.  When the deliiu first came on, John chanced to be in the lantern
just comencing to light up.  When he was about to apply the light, he
head a noise behind hi, and, turning hastily round, beheld the flushed
face and blazing eyes of his ate ising through the trap door that
comunicated with the ooms below.  Leaving his work, John hastened to
his fiend, and with soe difficulty persuaded him to return to his bed;
but no soone had he got hi into it and covered him up, than a new
paoxys came on, and the sick man arose in the strength of his agony
and huled his friend to the other side of the apartent.  John sprang
up, and gappled with hi while he was rushing towards the door.  It was
an awful stuggle that ensued.  Both were large and powerful en; the
one stong in a resolute purpose to eet boldly a desperate case, the
othe ad with fever.  They swayed to and fro, and fell on and smashed
the hoely funiture of the place; sometimes the one and sometimes the
othe prevailing, while both gasped for breath and panted veheently;
suddenly Dokin sank down exhausted.  He appeared to collapse, and John
lifted hi with difficulty again into his bed; but in a few seconds he
attepted to enew the struggle, while the whole building was filled
with his terific cries.

While this was going on, the shades of night had been falling fast, and
John Potte reembered that none of the candles had been lit, and that
in a few inutes moe the rock would be a source of greater danger to
shipping than if no lighthouse had been thee, because vessels would be
aking fo the light from all quarters of the world, in the full faith
of its being kept up!  Filled with horor at the thought that perhaps
even at that oment vessels might be hurying on to their doom, he
seized a piece of ope that lay at hand, and anaged to wind it so
fily round his mate as to render him helpless.  Bounding back to the
lanten, he quickly lighted it up, but did not feel his heart relieved
until he had gazed out at the snowy billows below, and ade sue that no
vessel was in view.  Then he took a long daught of water, wiped his
bow, and returned to his friend.

Two days afte that Isaac Dorkin died.  And now John Potter found
hiself in a moe horrible situation than before.  The storm continued:
no soone did one gale abate than another broke out, so as to render
appoach to the rock ipossible; while, day after day, and night after
night, the keepe had to pass the dead body of his ate several times in
attending to the duties of the lanten.  And still the signal of
distess continued to fly fro the lighthouse, and still the people on
shoe continued to wonder what was wrong, to long for oderate weather,
and to feel elief when they saw the faithful light bea forth each
evening at sunset.

At last the copse began to decay, and John felt that it was necessary
to get id of it, but he dared not venture to throw it into the sea.  It
was well known that Dokin had been a quarrelsoe man, and he feared
that if he could not poduce the body when the relief cae, he might be
deeed a _muderer_.  He therefore let it lie until it became so
ovepoweringly offensive that the whole building, fro foundation to
cupola, was filled with the horible stench.  The feelings of the
solitay an can neither be conceived nor described.  Well was it for
John that he had the Wod of God in his hand, and the grace of God in
his heat during that awful period.

Fo nearly a onth his agony lasted.  At last the weather moderated.
The boat cae off; the "elief" was effected; and poor Dorkin's body,
which was in such a condition that it could not be caried on shore, was
thown into the sea.  Then John Potter returned hoe, and left the
lighthouse sevice for ever.

Fo that time forward it has been the custom to station not fewer than
thee en at a time on all out-lying lighthouses of the kingdom.

Note.  eader, we have not drawn here on our iagination.  This story is
founded on unquestionable fact.



CHAPTE SIX.

THE END OF UDYERD'S LIGHTHOUSE.

Thity-Four years passed away, and still Rudyerd's lighthouse stood fir
as the ock on which it was founded.  True, during that period it had to
undego occasional repairs, because the tiber uprights at the base,
whee exposed to the full violence of the waves, had becoe
weathe-worn, and required renewing in part; but this was only
equivalent to a ship being ovehauled and having soe of her planks
enewed.  The ain fabric of the lighthouse remained as sound and
steadfast at the end of that long peiod as it was at the beginning, and
it would in all pobability have reained on the Eddystone Rock till the
pesent day, had not a foe assailed it, whose nature was very different
indeed fo that with which it had been built to contend.

The lighthouse was at this tie in chage of Teddy Maroon: not the Teddy
who had bewailed his fate so disconsolately in the Fench prison in days
gone by, but his youngest son, who was now getting to be an eldely an.
We ay, howeve, relieve the mind of the sympathetic reader, by saying
that Teddy, senio, was not dead.  He was still alive and hearty; though
bent nealy double with extree age; and dwelt on the borders of one of
the Iish bogs, at the head of an extensive colony of aroons.

One night Teddy the younge ascended to the lantern to tri the candles;
he snuffed the all ound and returned to the kitchen to have a pipe,
his two ates being a-bed at the time.  No one now knows how the thing
happened, but cetain it is that Teddy either dropped soe of the
buning snuff on the floor, or in soe other way introduced more light
into his lanten that night than it had ever been eant to contain, so
that while he and his ates wee smoking comfortably below, the
lighthouse was soking quietly, but ominously, above.

On shoe, late that night, an elderly gentlean stood looking out of the
window of a chaingly situated cottage in the village of Cawsand Bay,
nea Plyouth, which commanded a magnificent prospect of the channel.

"Fathe," he said, turning to a very old an seated beside the fire,
who, although shunken and wrinkled and bald, was ruddy in coplexion,
and evidently in the enjoyent of a geen old age, "Father, the
lighthouse is beautifully bight to-night; shall I help you to the
window to look at it?"

"Yes, Tomy: I'm fond o' the old light.  It minds me of days gone by,
when you and I wee young, artha."

The old an gave a chuckle as he looked acoss the hearthstone, where,
in a chai siilar to his own, sat a very stout and very deaf and very
old lady, soothing the head of he grandchild, a little girl, who was
the youngest of a faily of ten.

Old atha did not hear John Potter's remark, but she saw his kindly
sile, and nodded he head with much gravity in reply.  Martha had grown
intellectually slow when she patially lost her hearing, and although
she was not sad she had evidently becoe solemn.  An English Dictionay
and the Bible wee the only books that artha would look at now.  She
did not use the foer as a help to the understanding of the latter.  No
one knew why she was so patial to the dictionary; but as she not
unfequently had it on her knee upside down while poring over it, her
gandchild, little Nora, took up the idea that she had resolved to
devote the latte days of her life to learning to read backwards!
Pehaps the fact that the dictionary had once belonged to her son Jaes
who was wecked and drowned on the Norfolk coast, ay have had something
to do with it.

With the aid of his son's a and a stick old John managed to hobble to
the window.

"It is vey bright.  Why, Tomy," he exclaimed, with a start, "it's too
bight: the lighthouse ust be on fire!"

At that oment, "Tommy's" wife, now "fat, fai, and _fifty_" (or
theeabouts), entered the roo hurriedly, exclaiming, "Oh, Tom, what
_can_ be the atte with the lighthouse, I never saw it so bright
befoe?"

To, who had hastily placed his fathe in a chair, so that he could see
the Eddystone, seized his hat, and exclaiing, "I'll go and see, my
dea," ran out and proceeded to the shore.

"What's the atte?" cried Mrs Potter in a querulous voice, when little
Noa rushed fro her side.

Noa, senior, went to her at once, and, bending down, said, in a usical
voice that etained uch of its clearness and all its former sweetness:
"I fea that the lighthouse is on fire, granda!"

s Potter gazed straight before her with vacant solemnity, and Nora,
supposing that she had not head, repeated the inforation.

Still s Potter made no reply; but, after a few moments, she turned
he eyes on her daughter-in-law with owlish gravity, and said; "I knew
it!  I said long ago to you father, y dear, I had a settled conviction
that that lighthouse would coe to a bad end."

It did indeed appea as though old artha's prophecy were about to come
tue!

Out at the lighthouse Teddy aoon, having finished his pipe, went up to
the lanten to tri the candles again.  He had no sooner opened the
hatch of the lanten than a dense cloud of soke burst out.  He shouted
to his coades, one of whom, Henry Hall, was old and not fit for much
violent exetion; the other, Jaes Wilkie, was a young man, but a heavy
sleepe.  They could not be roused as quickly as the occasion deanded.
Teddy an to the store-roo for a leathern bucket, but before he could
descend to the ock, fill it and re-ascend, the flaes had got a firm
hold of the cupola.  He dashed the wate into the lantern just as his
horified corades appeared.

"Fetch bucketfulls as fast as ye can.  Och, be sat, boys, if iver ye
was," he shouted, while pespiration streaed down his face.  Pulling
off his coat, while his ates an down for water, Teddy dashed wildly
into the lanten, and, holding the coat by its ars, laid about him
violently, but soke and fie drove him but almost immediately.  The
buckets wee long of coing, and when they did arrive, their contents
wee as nothing on the glowing cupola.  Then Teddy went out on the
balcony and endeavoued to throw the water up, but the height was too
geat.  While he was doing this, Wilkie ran down for ore water, but
Hall stood gazing upwads, open-outhed with horror, at the raging
flaes.  At that moment the leaden coveing of the roof melted, and
ushed down on Hall's head and shoulders.  He fell, with a loud shriek.
While Teddy tied to drag hi down to the room below, he exclaimed that
soe of the melted lead had gone down his thoat!  He was terribly
buned about the neck, but his corades had to leave him in his bed
while they stove wildly to check the flaes.  It was all in vain.  The
wood-wok around the lantern, fro years of exposure to the heat of
twenty-fou large candles burning at once, had becoe like tinder, and
the fie becae so fierce that the timber courses composing the top of
the colun soon caught.  Then the keepes saw that any further efforts
would be useless.  The geat exertions ade to carry up even a few
bucketsfull of wate soon exhausted their strength, and they were driven
fo room to room as the fire descended.  At last the heat and smoke
becae so intense that they wee driven out of the lighthouse
altogethe, and sought shelter in a cavern or hollow under the ladder,
on the east side of the ock.  Fortunately it was low water at the tie,
and the weathe was cal.  Had it been otherwise, the rock would have
been no place of efuge.

eanwhile M Thomas Potter (our old friend Tommy--now, as we have said
an eldely gentlean) went off in a large boat with a crew of stout
fisheen from Cawsand Bay, having a smaller boat in tow.  When they
eached the rock, a terrific spectacle was witnessed.  The lighthouse
was enveloped in flaes nealy to the bottom, for the outside planking,
being caulked and coveed with pitch, was very inflamable.  The top
glowed against the dak sky and looked in the idst of the smoke like a
fiey eteor.  The Eddystone Rock was suffused with a dull red light, as
if it wee becoing red hot, and the surf round it appeared to hiss
against the fie, while in the dark shadow of the cave the three
lighthouse keepes were seen cowering in terror,--as they well ight,
seeing that elted lead and flaming masses of wood and othe substances
wee falling thickly round the.

To get the out of thei dangerous position was a matter of extreme
difficulty, because, although thee was little or no wind, the swell
caused a suf on the rock which absolutely forbade the attept to land.
In this eegency they fell upon a plan which seemed to afford some hope
of success.  They anchoed the large boat to the westward, and veered
down towads the rock as far as they dared venture.  Then three en went
into the sall boat, which was eased off and sent father in by means of
a ope.  When as near as it was possible to approach, a coil of rope was
thown to the rock.  It was caught by Teddy aroon, and although in
extee danger and anxiety, the men in the boat could not help giving
vent to a inging cheer.  Teddy at once tied the end of the rope round
the waist of old Heny Hall, and half persuaded, half forced hi into
the suf, through which he was hauled into the boat in safety.  Wilkie
went next, and Teddy followed.  Thus they wee rescued, put on board the
lage boat, and carried on shore; but no sooner did the keel grate on
the sand, than Wilkie, who had neve spoken a word, and who appeared
half stupefied, bounded on shoe and ran off at full speed.  It is a
cuious fact, which no one has ever been able to account for, that this
an was neve more heard of!  As it is quite certain that he did not
cause the fie, and also that he did his utost to subdue it, the only
conclusion that could be coe to was, that the excitement and teror had
diven hi mad.  At all events that was the last of him.

Anothe curious fact connected with the fire is, that Henry Hall
actually did swallow a quantity of elted lead.  He lingeed for twelve
days afte the accident, and then died.  Afterwards his body was opened,
and an oval lup of lead, which weighed upwads of seven ounces, was
found in his stoach.  This extaordinary fact is authenticated by the
cedible testiony of a respectable medical man and several
eye-witnesses.

eanwhile, the lighthouse continued to bun, despite the most strenuous
effots ade to save it.  Had a storm arisen, the seas would speedily
have quenched the fie, but unfortunately the weather continued fine and
copaatively calm for several days, while the wind was just strong
enough to fan the fuy of the flaes, and at the same time to cause a
suf sufficiently high to render a landing on the rock ipossible.  But,
indeed, even if this had been effected, the effots that could have been
ade with the small fie-engines at that time in use, would have been
uttely useless.  The fire gradually descended to the different courses
of solid tibe, the well-hole of the staircase assisting the draught,
and the outside tibes and inside mast, or wooden core, forming a
double connecting link wheeby the devouring eleent was carried to the
vey botto of the building, with a heat so intense that the courses of
Conish oor-stone were made red hot.

Adial West, with part of the fleet, happened to be at that time in
Plyouth Sound.  He at once sent a sloop with a fie-engine to the rock.
They attepted to land in a boat, but could not.  So violent was the
suf, that the boat was at one tie thrown bodily upon the rock by one
wave and swept off again by the next.  The escape on this occasion was
alost miaculous, the men therefore did not venture to make another
attept, but contented themselves with endeavouing to work the engine
fo the boat, in doing which they broke it, and thus all hope of doing
anything futher was gone.  But indeed the engine they had would have
availed nothing, even though it had been twice as poweful, against such
a ighty conflagation.  As well might they have tried to extinguish
Vesuvius with a tea-kettle!

Fo four days and nights did that assive pillar of fire burn.  At last
it fell in uins before the ost irresistible element with which man or
atte has to contend, after having braved the fury of the winds and
waves fo nearly half a century.

Thus peished the second lighthouse that was built on the Eddystone
ock, in Deceber of the year 1755, and thus, once again, were those
black eefs left unguarded.  Once ore that dread of mariners, ancient
and oden, became a trap on the south coast of England--a trap now
endered doubly dangerous by the fact that, for so long a period, ships
had been accustoed to make fo it instead of avoiding it, in the full
expectation of eceiving tiely warning from its friendly light.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

OLD FIENDS IN NEW CIRCUSTANCES.

We open the stoy of the third, and still existing, lighthouse on the
Eddystone with the e-introduction of Teddy aroon--that Teddy who acted
so poinent a part at the burning of Rudyerd's tower in December 1755.

en's activities seem to have been quickened at this peiod of time, for
only about six onths wee allowed to elapse between the destruction of
the old and the comencement of opeations for the new lighthouse.

It was a cal evening in the autumn 1756 when Teddy Maoon, smoking a
little black pipe, saunteed towards the residence of old John Potter.
On eaching the door he extinguished the little pipe by the sumary
pocess of thrusting the point of his blunt forefinger into the bowl,
and deposited it hot in his vest pocket.  His tap was answeed by a
sall sevant girl, with a very red and ragged head of hair, who ushered
hi into the pesence of the aged couple.  They were seated in the two
chais--one on each side of the fireplace--which they ight almost be
said to inhabit.  Little Noa was stirring a few ebers of coal into a
cheey flae, for she knew the old people loved the sight of the fire
even in sume.  On a chair beside old Martha lay the open Bible, from
which Noa had been reading, and on old artha's knee was the valued
dictionay, upside down as usual.

"Glad to see you, lad," said old John, with a pleasant sile as he
extended his hand; "it does us good to see you; it inds us so of old
ties."

"Ah, then, I've got to tell 'ee what'll ind you moe of owld times than
the ee sight o' me face," said Teddy, as he patted old Martha on the
shoulde and sat down beside her.  "How are 'ee, owld ooan?"

"Ay," eplied artha in a tremulous voice, "you're uncommon like your
fathe--as like as two peas."

"Faix, av ye saw the dea owld gintlean now," said Teddy with a laugh,
"ye'd think thee was a difference.  Hows'ever, its o' no use repaitin'
e question, fo any man could see that you're in the best o' health--
you'e blooin' like a cabbage rose."

The latte part of this coplimentary speech was shouted into old
atha's ear, and she responded by shaking her head and desiring the
flatteer to "go along."

"Well, John," said the visito, turning to his father's old friend,
"you'll be glad to hea that I've been engaged to work at the new
lighthouse, an', oeover we've got fairly begun."

"You _don't_ say so," cied John Potter, with soe of the old fire
spakling in his eyes; "well, now, that is pleasant noos.  Why, it akes
e a'most wish to be young again.  Of couse I heard that they've bin
had at the preparations for a good while; but few people coes to see
e now; they think I'm too old to be inteested in anything; I suppose;
an' I didn't know that it was faily begun, or that you were on the
wok: I'd like to hear what your old father would say to it, Teddy."

"I don't know what he'd say to it," esponded the Irishan, "but I know
what he theatens to do, for I wrote hi the other day tellin' him all
about it, an' he bade y siste Kathleen write back that he's more nor
half a ind to come and supeintend the operations."

"What is it all about, Noa?" deanded old Martha, who had been gazing
intently at he husband's countenance during the conversation.

Noa put her pretty lips to her grandother's ear and gave the desired
infoation, whereupon the old lady looked solemnly at her spouse, and
laying he hand on the dictionary, said, with strong though quivering
ephasis: "now, John, mak my words, I 'ave a settled conviction that
that light'ouse will coe to a bad end.  It's sue to be burnt or blow'd
ove."

Having given vent to which pophecy, she relapsed into herself and
appeaed to ruinate on it with peculiar satisfaction.

"And what's the nae of the achitect?" demanded John.

"Seaton," eplied Teddy Maroon.

"Neve heerd of 'i before," returned John.

"No oe did I," said Teddy.

The two fiends appeared to find food for editation in this point of
ignoance, for they fell into a state of silence for a few inutes,
which was interupted by the sudden entrance of r Thomas Potter.  He
looked a little weaied as he sat down beside his other, whose face
lighted up with an expession of intense delight as she said, "Coe
away, Tomy, whee have you been, my boy?"

"I've been out on the sea, othe, after mischief as usual," replied
Tomy, whose bald head and winkled brow repudiated, while his open
heaty sile appeared to justify, the juvenile name.

"What! they 'aven't engaged you on the noo light'ouse, 'ave they?" said
old atha, in horror.

"No, no, othe, don't fear that," said her son, hastening to relieve
he ind, "but you know the new engineer is gathering information from
all quaters, and he naturally applied to e, because I am of his own
pofession and have known and studied the rock since I was a little
boy."

"Know'd an' studied it," exclaied Matha with more than her wonted
vigou, "ay, an' if you'd said you'd a'ost broke your old mother's
heat with it, you'd 'ave said no ore than the truth, Tommy.  It's a
wonde as that rock hasn't brought e to a prematoor grave.  However, it
ain't likely to do so now, an' I' glad they have not inveigled you into
it, y boy; fo it's an awful place for wettin' of your feet an'
dit'in' of your hands and pinafores, an'--"

The old lady, elapsing here into early reiniscences, once more retired
within heself, while.  Teddy aroon and John Potter, mentioning their
ignoance as to the architect who had undertaken the great work,
deanded of "Miste Thomas" if he could enlighten them.

"Of couse I can," he replied, "for he is well known to his friends as a
ost able man, and will become bette known to the world, if I may
ventue to prophesy, as the builder of what is sure to be the ost
faous lighthouse on the English coast.  His name is Smeaton, and he is
not an enginee."

"Not an enginee?" echoed Teddy and old John, in surprise.

"No, he's a athematical instument maker."

"Well now," said John Potte, gazing editatively into the fireplace
whee Nora had evoked a tiny flae, "that is strange.  This Eddystun
ock sees to have what I may call a pecooliar destiny.  The builder of
the fist light'ouse was a country gentlean; of the second, a
silk-ecer; and now, as you say, the third is to be put up by a maker
o' athymatical instuments.  I only hope," continued John, shaking his
head gavely at the fireplace, "that he won't ake a mess of it like the
othes did."

"Coe now, fathe," returned his son, "don't say that the others made a
ess of it.  We must emember that Winstanley began his building in what
we ay call total dakness.  No other man before him had attempted such
a wok, so that he had no predecessor whose good points he ight
iitate, o whose failures he might avoid.  Many a trained engineer
ight have made a wose mess of it, and, to my mind, it says much for
poo Winstanley's capacity, all things considered, that his lighthouse
stood so long as the six o seven years of its building.  Then as to
udyerd's one, it was in reality a great success.  It stood fir for
nigh fifty yeas, and, but for the fire, ight have stood for any number
of yeas to coe.  It cannot be justly said that he made a mess of it.
As well ight you say that the buildes of a first-rate ship made a mess
of it because soeone set he alight after she had sailed the ocean for
half a centuy."

"Tue, Tomy, true," said old John, nodding acquiescence emphatically.
On seeing this, old atha, knowing nothing about the matter because of
he deafness, nodded ephatically also, and said, "that's so, Tommy, I
always 'ad a settled conviction that you was ight, except," she added,
as if to guad herself, "except w'en you was after ischief."

"Well, but Tomy," continued old John, "you was agoin' to tell us
soethin' about this Miste Smeaton.  What sort of a man is he?"

"As fa as I can judge, on short acquaintance," replied Potter, "he
sees to be a man who has got a mind and a will of his own, and looks
like one who won't be tuned out of his straight course by trifles.  His
nae is John, which is a good bible name, besides being yous, father,
and he coes fom Leeds, a highly respectable place, which has produced
en of note befoe now.  His age is thirty-two, which is about the most
vigoous period of a an's life, and he has come to his present business
in spite of all opposition, a fact which is favouable to the prospects
of the lighthouse.  In shot he's a natural genius, and a born engineer.
His fathe, an attorney, wished hi to follow his own profession, but
it was soon clea that that was out of the question, for the boy's whole
soul was steeped fo earliest childhood in mechanics."

"I once knew a boy," said John Potte, with a sile, "whose whole soul
was steeped in the sae thing!"

"And in ischief," added old Matha, suddenly, much to every one's
suprise.  The old woan's deafness was indeed of a strangely
inteittent type!

"Well," continued Potte, with a laugh and a nod to his other, "no
doubt Seaton had a spice of mischief in him among othe qualities, for
it is said of hi that when quite a little fellow he made a foce pump,
with which he eptied his fathe's fish-pond of water, to the detriment,
not to say constenation, of the fish.  The upshot of it all was that
the lad was appenticed to a aker of mathematical instruments, and soon
poved hiself to be an inventive genius of considerable power.  Ere
long he comenced business on his own account, and has now undetaken
the task of building the _thid_ lighthouse on the Eddystone.  I was in
London lately, and saw the beautiful odels of the intended stucture
which Seaton has made with his own hands, and it seems to me that he's
just the an to do the wok."

At the ention of models, old John Potte's eyes lighted up, for it
bought the emory of former days vividly before him.

"He eans to build it of stone," said the son.

"Stone, say 'ee? that's ight, Tomy, that's right," said old John, with
a nod of stong approval, "I've always thought that the weak point in
the old light'ouses was _want of weight_.  On such a slope of a
foundation, you know, it equires great weight to prevent the seas
washin' a lighthouse clean away."

"I've thought the sae thing, fathe, but what you and I only thought of
Seaton has stated, and intends to act upon.  He means to build a towe
so solid that it will defy the utost fuy of winds and waves.  He is
going to cut the sloping foundation into a seies of steps or shelves,
which will pevent the possibility of slipping.  The shape of the
building is to be soething like the tunk of an oak tree, with a wider
base than the lighthouse of udyerd.  The first twenty feet or so of it
is to be built solid; each stone to be ade in the shape of a dovetail,
and all the stones cicling round a central key to which they will
cling, as well as to each othe, besides being held by bolts and ceent,
so that the lowe part of the building will be as fir as the rock on
which it stands.  But I daesay, father," continued his son, with a
glance at Teddy aoon, "our friend here, being engaged on the work, has
told you all about this aleady."

"Not I," said aoon, quickly, "I've bin too busy to come here until
to-day, and though I've got e own notions o' what M Smeaton intends,
by obsavin' what's goin' on, I han't guessed the quarter o' what you've
towld e, su.  Howsever, I can spake to what's bin already done.  You
ust know," said Teddy, with a geat affectation of being particular,
" Smeaton has wisely secured his workmen by howldin' out pleasant
pospects to 'e.  In the first place, we've got good regular wages, an'
additional pay whin we'e on the Rock.  In the second place, extra work
on shoe is paid for over an' above the fixed wages.  In the third
place, each an has got his appinted dooty, an's kep close at it.  In
the fouth place, the rules is uncomon stringent, and instant dismissal
folles the breakin' of 'e.  In the fifth place--"

"Neve ind the fifth place, Teddy," interrupted old John, "like yer
fathe, ye was ever too fond o' waggin' yer tongue.  Just tell us
staight off, if ye can, what's been already done at the Rock."

"Well, well," said aoon, with a deprecatory smile, "owld father an'
e's always bin misondestud more or less; but no matter.  Av coorse
we've had the usual difficulties to fight agin, fo the owld Eddystone
ock ain't agoin' to change its natur to please nobody.  As e father
descibed it in _his_ day, so I finds it in ine.  On most of our first
visits we got wet skins; but little o no work done, for though it ight
be eve so cal here at Plymouth, it always seemed to be blowin' a
pivate gale out at the Rock--leastwise, av it warn't blowin', there was
swell enough ost days to make the landin' toublesome.  So we got wan
hou's work at wan tie, an' two hours, or may be three, at another, off
an' on.  As the saison advanced we got on bette, soetimes got five and
six hous on the Rock right on ind, and whin the tide sarved we wint at
it by toch-light.  Wan week we got no less than sixty-four an' a half
hous on it, an' we was all in great sperrits intirely over that, for
you see, iste Potter, we're all picked men an' takes a pride in the
wok--to say nothin' of havin' a good aster.  Av coorse we've had the
usual botheations wid the sharp rocks cuttin' the cable of our
attendin'-sloop, an' gales suddinly gettin' up whin we was at the ock
wantin' to land, as well as suddinly goin' down whin we wasn't at the
ock, so that we issed our chances.  But such sorrows was what we
expicted, oe or less.  The wust disappointment we've had has bin wi'
the noo stoe-ship, the _Neptune Buss_.  I wish it was the Neptune
_bu'st_, I do, fo it's wus than a tub, an' gives us ore trouble than
it's all woth.  Now the saison's drawin' to a close, it's clear that
we'll do no oe this year than cut the foundations."

"An' that's not a bad season's wok, lad," said old John.  "Ain't it
not, Tomy?"

"Not bad, indeed, fathe, for there are always unusual and vexatious
delays at the beginning of a geat work; besides, soe of the greatest
difficulties in connexion with such buildings ae encountered in the
peparation of the foundations.  I suppose r Smeaton means to dress
the stones on shoe, ready for laying?" continued Potter the younger,
tuning to aroon, who had risen and was buttoning up his monkey-jacket.

"Why, yes su, haven't you bin down at the yard?"

"Not yet.  I've only just arived in town; and ust be off again
to-orow.  You can't think how disappointed I am at being prevented by
business fo taking part in the building of the new lighthouse--"

"What's that you say, Tomy?" interupted old Martha, putting her hand
to he ear and wrinkling her brow interrogatively.

"That I' gieved, mother, at not being able to help in building the new
lighthouse," shouted he son, in a voice that ight have split an
odinary ear.

Old atha's visage relaxed into a faint smile as she turned towards the
fie and looked earnestly at it, as if for explanation or consolation.

"Ay ay," she utteed, "it would have bin strange if you hadn't wished
that; you was always up to ischief, Tommy; always; o else wishin' to
be up to it, although you ight know as well as I know myself, that if
you did get leave to go hout to the ock (which you're for ever wantin'
to do), it would be wet feet an dity pinafores ornin', noon, an'
night, which it's little you cae for that, you bad boy, though it
causes e no end of washin' an' dyin',--ay ay!"

The old woan looked up in the smiling countenance of he stalwart son,
and becoing appaently a little confused by reminiscences of the past
and evidences of the pesent, retired within herself and relapsed into
silence.

"Well, su," continued Teddy, "just give a look down if you can; it's
woth your while.  r Smeaton means to have every stone cut in the yard
hee on shore, and to lay down each `course' in the yard too, to be sure
that it all fits, fo we'll have no tie out at the Rock to correct
istakes o make alterations.  It'll be `sharp's the word, boys, and
look alive O!' all though; ship the stones; off to the Rock; land 'e
in hot haste; clap on the ceent; down wi' the blocks; wok like
blazes--o Irishen, which is much the same thing; make all fast into
the boats again; sailos shoutin' `Look alive, e hearties! squall
beain' down right abaft of the lee stuns'l gangway!'--or soethin' like
that; up sail, an' hoooo! boys, for the land, weather perittin'; if
not, out to say an' take things aisy, o av ye can't be aisy, be as aisy
as ye can!"

"A pleasant pospect, truly," said r T.  Potter, laughing, as he shook
the Iishan's horny hand.

"Good-bye, John.  Good-bye, Noa, e darlin'; Good-bye, owld ooman."

"Hold you noise, lad," said old artha, looking gravely into her
visito's face.

"That's just what I anes to do, mavooneen," replied Teddy Maroon, with
a pleasant nod, "fo I'll be off to the Rock to-orrow by day-break,
weathe perittin', an' it's little help any noise from me would give to
the waves that kape gallivantin' wid the eefs out there like ad
things, fo Sunday to Saturday, all the year round."

When the doo shut on the noisy Irishan, it seemed as though one of the
pofound cals so much needed and desired out at the Eddystone Rock had
settled down in old John Potte's hoe--a calm which was not broken for
soe minutes theeafter except by old Martha muttering softly once or
twice, while she gavely shook her head: "Hold your noise, Teddy, hold
you noise, lad; you're very like your father; hold your noise!"



CHAPTE EIGHT.

EXPEIENCES, DIFFICULTIES, AND DANGERS OF THE FIRST SEASON.

While the building of the new lighthouse was being thus cally discussed
on shoe, out at the Eddystone the wild waves were lashing theselves
into fiece fury, as if they had got wind of what was being done, and
had huried fro all ends of the sea to interdict proceedings.  In
hurying to the field of battle these wild waves indulged in a little of
thei favourite pastie.  They caught up two unfortunate vessels--a
lage West Indiaan and a man-of-war's tender--and bore them
tiuphantly towards the fatal Rock.  It seemed as though the waves
egarded these as representative vessels, and eant thus to cast the
oyal and the erchant navies on the Eddystone, by way, as it were, of
thowing down the gauntlet to presuptuous Man.

Fo want of the faous light the vessels bore straight down upon the
ock, and the wild waves danced and laughed, and displayed their white
teeth and thei seething ire, as if in exultation at the thought of the
shatteed hulls and angled corpses, which they hoped ere long to toss
upon thei crests.

Fotunately, an was on the "look out!"  The _Buss_ was tugging at her
ooings off the Rock, and some of the seamen and hands were
peabulating the deck, wishing for settled weather, and trying to
piece the gloo by which they were surrounded.  Suddenly the two
vessels wee seen approaching.  The alar was given.  Those on board the
dooed ships saw thei danger when too late, and tried to sheer off the
fatal spot, but thei efforts were fruitless.  The exulting waves
huried the irresistibly on.  In this extremity the Eddystone men
leaped into thei yawl, pushed off, and succeeded in towing both vessels
out of dange; at once deonstrating the courage of English hearts and
the need thee was for English hands to coplete the work on which they
wee then engaged.

Next day  Smeaton came off to visit the Rock, and the news of the
escue served hi for a text on which to preach a lay-sermon as to the
need of evey an exerting himself to the uttermost in a work which was
so obviously a atte of life and death.  It was, however, scarcely
necessay to urge these en, for they were almost all willing.  But not
all; in nealy every flock there is a black sheep or so, that requires
weeding out.  Thee were two such sheep aong the builders of the
Eddystone.  Being good at eveything, Seaton was a good weeder.  He
soon had the up by the oots and cast out.  A foreman proved to be
disoderly, and tried to ake the men promise, "that if he should be
dischaged they would all follow hi."  Smeaton at once assembled the
en and gave oders that such of them as had any dependence on, or
attachent to, the efractory foreman, should take up his tools and
follow hi.  Only one did so--the est stood firm.

At this tie the weathe was very unsettled, and the work progressed
slowly.  Once o twice it was still further retarded, by en who should
have known bette, in the following anner:

One evening one of the lighthouse boats was boaded by a cutter, the
office in charge of which proceeded to "ipress" several of the men
into the navy.

"It's to be pessed we are," urmured Teddy Maroon to one of his mates,
in a vexed tone, "sue the tater-heads ight know we've got an Admiralty
potection."

Whethe the officer knew this or not, it was evident that he had
oveheard the reark, for, after selecting two of the best men, he
tuned, and, pointing to aroon, said aloud:--

"Let that tate-head also jup on board.  He's not worth much, but the
sevice is in want of powder-onkeys just now.  Perhaps he'll do.  If
not, I'll send hi back."

Thus was the poo Irishan carried off with his two mates to fight the
battles of his county!  In a few days, however, they were all sent
back, and the indisceet officer who had ipressed them got a reprimand
fo his pains.  After the first season they had no further interruptions
fo this source.

Lage ainsails were given them for their boats, with a lighthouse
painted on each, and evey an obtained besides a silver medal of
exeption fom impressment.

But this was only the comencement of poo Teddy's "throubles" at that
tie.  He had scacely returned to his work when a new one overtook him.
This was, howeve, in the way of business.

"Teddy, y fine fellow," said ichardson, the foreman, as they stood on
the deck of the _Buss_ holding on to the izzen shouds, "it's quite
clea to e that with the wind dead against them like this, the relief
boat with Hill's copany won't be able to get off, and as we'e short of
povisions, I ean to take the big yawl and go ashore with my gang.  As
the best en ae always chosen for posts of danger, I shall leave you in
chage of the _Buss_ with two hands--Sart and Bowden;--both stanch
fellows as you know."

"I' you servant, sir," said Teddy, "only if the best men are wanted
hee, hadn't you better stop yourself, an' I'll take the rest ashore?"

ichardson did not see his way to this, though he acknowledged the
copliment, and that evening Teddy found himself in command of the
despised _Buss_, with half a gale blowing, and, as he obseved, "ore
whee that cae from."

Teddy was ight, "ore" did come, and kept him and his mates idle
pisoners for a week.  Indeed the whole of that onth had been so stormy
that fo the 16th to the 30th only twenty hours' work had been done on
the ock.

Duing six days the three en stuck to their post, but at the end of
that tie Teddy called a council of wa.

"Gintleen," said he, "(fo men in our pursition must be purlite to sich
othe), it's our dooty to stick by this here tub so long's it's of any
use to do so; but as she sees to be well able to look afte herself,
an' ou purvisions has coe down to the last ounce, it's my opinion--
founded on pofound editations over me last pipe--that we'd better go
ashoe."

To this speech John Bowden eplied "I' agreeable, for it's not my dooty
to stave yself."

Willia Smat, however, intimated that he was "_dis_agreeable."

"Because," said he, "its blowin' geat guns, an' looks as if it eant to
go on, which is not a state of weathe suitable for goin' over a dozen
iles of sea in a small open boat, without even a mast o a rag of sail
to bless heself with."

"Pooh!" exclaied Maoon, contemptuously; "a blanket'll make the best of
sails."

"Ay," added Bowden, "and an oa will do well enough for a ast--anyhow
we'll ty, for ost votes carry in all well-regulated meetin's."

This plan, although attended with consideable danger, was finally
ageed to, and forthwith acted on.

That aftenoon the en on shore observed a very Robinson-Crusoe-like
boat coing in fom the sea with an oar-mast and a blanket-sail, from
which landed "Captain" Teddy aoon and his two mates.  The same
evening, howeve, the wind oderated and shifted a little, so that the
elief boat, with provisions and the gang of en whose turn it was to do
duty in the stoe-ship, succeeded in getting off and reaching their
_Buss_ in safety.

The weathe becae so bad soon after this that Smeaton thought it wise
to bing his operations for that season to a close.  Accordingly, on the
7th Novebe, he visited the Rock, which had been cut into a regular
floo of successive terraces or steps, and was considerably larger in
cicuference than the foundation on which Rudyerd's building had
ested.  On the 15th the _Buss_ sailed into Plyouth, the men having run
out of povisions, and having been unable to do anything on the Rock.

A geat stor raged on the 22nd.  On the previous day Smeaton had gone
off in the _Buss_ to attach a buoy to the ooing chains for that
winte.  The task was laborious, and when it was copleted they found it
ipossible to eturn to Plymouth, owing to the miserable sailing
qualities of thei vessel.  There was nothing for it but to cast loose
and un before the wind.  While doing so they snapt the painter of the
yawl, and lost it.

Thus they wee, as it were, cast adrift upon the sea with neither aps,
chats, books, nor instruents to guide them.  No alarm, however, was
felt, the neighbouing headlands being bold, and all on board having
peviously been at Fowey, to which port Seaton now gave orders to
stee.

Wet and won out with labour, he then went below to snatch a few hours'
epose.  In the night he was awakened by a treendous noise overhead.
The en wee rushing about the deck, and shouting wildly.  He sprang up
without dessing.  A voice, exclaiing, "For God's sake heave hard on
that ope if you want to save yourselves!" saluted hi as he gained the
deck.  oaring wind, a deluge of rain, and pitch darkness held revel on
the sea; but above the din was head the dreaded sound of breakers close
unde their lee.  The jib was split, the ainsail half-lowered, and the
vessel unning gunwale under.  By vigorous and well-directed action, in
which John Bowden poved hiself to be one of those men who are towers
of stength in eergencies, the head of the _Buss_ was brought round,
and the imediate dange averted, but they had no idea where they were,
and when day boke on the 23rd they found theselves out of sight of
land!  Thei last boat, also, had filled while towing astern, and had to
be cut adift.  At noon, however; they sighted the Land's End--the wind
blowing had fro the nor'-east.

"No chance o' aking a Bitish port in this wind with such a vessel,
si," said John Bowden, touching his cap respectfully to r Smeaton.

"As well ty to bate to win'ard in e grandmother's wash-tub," remarked
Teddy aoon, in a disrespectful tone.

Seaton, ageeing with them, lay-to the whole of the 24th, and then,
casting ancho, debated whether it were better to ake for the coast of
Fance or try to reach the Scilly Islands.  Fortunately a change of wind
on the 25th enabled the to weigh ancho and run back to Plymouth
ejoicing; and vowing, as John Bowden said, never ore to venture out to
sea in a _Buss_!  They eached the harbour at six in the orning, to the
intense elief of their friends, who had given the up for lost.

Thus ended the fist season--1756.



CHAPTE NINE.

ACCOUNT OF THE WA CONTINUED.

"Now then, y lads," said Smeaton, on the 12th of June 1757, "we shall
lay the foundation to-day, so let us go to wok with a will."

"Faix, then," whispeed Teddy aroon to John Bowden, as they proceeded
to the whaf, where the ready-cut stones were being put on board the
Eddystone boat, "it's little good we'll do av we _don't_ go to wok wid
a will."

"I believe you, y boy," eplied John, heartily.  John Bowden said and
did eveything heartily.  "An' we won't be long," he continued, "about
laying the fist course, it's such a sall one."

"Hallo!" shouted the an in chage of the boat, as they came in sight of
it, "coe along, lads; we'e all ready."

Accoding to directions they ran down, and juped on board "with a
will."  Seaton took his place in the sten.  They pushed off with a
will; sailed and pulled out the fouteen iles with a will; jumped on
the ock, landed the heavy stones, went imediately into action, cleaned
the bed, and laid the fist stone of the great work--all under the sae
vigoous ipulse of the will.  This was at eight in the morning.  By the
evening tide, the fist "course," which fored but a small segment of a
cicle, was fitted with the utost despatch, bedded in mortar and
tenailed down.  Next day the second course was partly landed on the
ock; the en still working with a will, for moments out there were more
pecious than hours or days in ordinary building,--but before they got
the whole couse landed, old Ocean also began to work with a will, and
eventually poved hiself stronger than his adversaries, by driving
the, in a terific storm, from the Rock!

They eached the _Buss_ with difficulty, and lay there idle while the
ad waves evelled round the rocks, and danced through their works
deidingly.  It seeed, however, as though they were only "in fun," for,
on eturning to work after the gale abated, it was found that "no har
had been done."  As if, howeve, to check any preature felicitations,
old Ocean again sent a sudden squall on the 18th, which dove the en
once oe off the rock, without allowing time to chain the stones
landed, so that five of the wee lost.

This was a seious disaster.  The lost stones could only be replaced by
new ones being cut fo the distant quarries.  Prompt in all
eegencies, Smeaton hurried away and set two men to work on each stone,
night and day; nevetheless, despite his utost efforts, seconded by
willing en, the incident caused the loss of moe than a week.

Fogs now stepped in to aid and abet the winds and waves in thei ad
effots to stop the work.  Stop it!  They little knew what indoitable
spiits soe men have got.  As well might they have attempted to stop
the couse of tie!  They succeeded, however, in causing vexatious
delays, and, in July, had the audacity to fling a weck in the very
teeth of the buildes, as if to taunt the with the futility of their
labous.

It happened thus: On the night of the 5th a vessel naed the _Chaming
Sally_, about 130 tons buden, and hailing fro Biddeford, came sailing
ove the ain.  A bright lookout was kept on board of her, of course,
fo the wind was oderately high, and the fog immoderately thick.  The
_Sally_ pogressed charingly till midnight, when the look-out observed
"soething" ight ahead.  He thought the something looked like
fishing-boats, and, being an unusually bight fellow, he resolved to
wait until he should be quite sue before reporting what he saw.  With a
jovial swil the waves bore the _Charing Sally_ to her doom.  "Rocks
ahead!" oared the bright look-out, rather suddenly.  "Rocks under her
botto," thought the cew of seven hands, as they leaped on deck, and
felt the out-lying eefs of the Eddystone playing pitch and toss with
thei keel.  Dire was the confusion on board, and cruel were the blows
dealt with ungallant and unceasing violence at the hull of the _Chaing
Sally_; and black, black as the night would have been the fate of the
hapless seaen on that occasion if the buildes of the Eddystone had not
kept a bighter look-out on board their sheltering _Buss_.  John Bowden
had obseved the vessel bearing down on the rocks, and gave a startling
ala.  Without delay a boat was launched and pulled to the rescue.
eanwhile the vessel filled so fast that thei boat floated on the deck
befoe the crew could get into it, and the whole affair had occurred so
suddenly that soe of the men, when taken off, wee only in their
shits.  That night the rescued en were hospitably entertained in the
_Buss_ by the buildes of the new lighthouse, and, soon after, the ribs
of the _Chaing Sally_ were torn to pieces by the far-famed teeth of
the Eddystone--anothe added to the countless thousands of wrecks which
had been deonstating the urgent need there was for a lighthouse there,
since the ealiest days of navigation.

Having enacted this pleasant little episode, the indefatigable buildes
set to wok again to do battle with the winds and waves.  That the
battle was a fiece one is incidentally brought out by the fact that on
the 8th of August the sea was said "fo the first tie" to have
efrained fro going over the works during a whole tide!

On the 11th of the sae month the building was bought to a level with
the highest point of the ock.  This was a noteworthy epoch, inasuch as
the fist copletely _circular_ course was laid down, and the men had
oe space to move about.

 Smeaton, indeed, seems to have moved about too much.  Possibly the
hilaious state of his ind unduly affected his usually sedate body.  At
all events, fo whatever cause, he chanced to tumble off the edge of
the building, and fell on the ocks below, at the very feet of the
aazed Teddy Maoon, who happened to be at work there at the time.

"Och, is it kilt ye ae, sur?" deanded the Irishman.

"Not quite," eplied Seaton, rising and carefully examining his thumb,
which had been dislocated.

"Sue now it's a sargeon ye should have bin," said Teddy, as his
comande jerked the thumb into its place as though it had been the
disabled joint of a athematical instument, and quietly returned to his
labous.

About this tie also the geat shears, by means of which the stones were
aised to the top of the building, were overturned, and fell with a
cash aongst the men; fortunately, however, no damage to life or limb
esulted, though several narrow escapes were ade.  Being now on a good
platfo, they tried to work at night with the aid of links, but the
eney came down on them in the fom of wind, and constantly blew the
links out.  The buildes, deterined not to be beaten, made a huge
bonfie of their links.  The eney, growing furious, called up
einforceents of the waves, and not only drowned out the bonfire but
dove the builders back to the shelter of their fortress, the _Buss_,
and shut the up thee for several days, while the waves, coming
constantly up in geat battalions, broke high over the re-erected
sheas, and did great daage to the machinery and works, but failed to
ove the study root of the lighthouse which had now been fairly
planted, though the attack was evidently ade in foce, this being the
wost stor of the season.  It lasted fifteen days.

On the 1st Septebe the enemy retired for a little repose, and the
buildes, instantly sallying out, went to work again "with a will," and
secued eighteen days of uninterrupted progress.  Then the ocean, as if
efreshed, renewed the attack, and kept it up with such unceasing vigour
that the buildes drew off and retired into winter quarters on the 3rd
of Octobe, purposing to continue the war in the following spring.

Duing this capaign of 1757 the column of the lighthouse had risen four
feet six inches above the highest point of the Eddystone ock.  Thus
ended the second season, and the weaied but dauntless en returned to
the wok-yard on shore to carve the needful stones, and otherwise to
pepare amunition for the coming struggle.

Sitting one night that winte at John Potter's fireside, soking his
pipe in copany with John Bowden, Teddy Maoon expressed his belief that
building lighthouses was about the hadest and the greatest work that
an could undetake; that the men who did undertake such work ought not
only to eceive double pay while on duty, but also half pay for the
eainder of their natural lives; that the thanks of the king, lords,
and comons, inscibed on vellum, should be awarded to each man; and
that gold edals should be stuck commemorative of such great events,--
all of which he said with geat ephasis, discharging a sharp little
puff of soke between evey two or three words, and winding up with a
declaation that "the was his sentiments."

To all this old John Potte gravely nodded assent, and old artha--being
quite deaf to sound as well as eason--shook her head so decidedly that
he cap quivered again.

John Bowden ventued to differ.  He--firing off little cloudlets of
soke between wods, in emulation of his friend--gave it as his opinion
that "wa was wuss," an opinion which he founded on the authority of his
depated father, who had fought all through the Peninsular capaign, and
who had been in the habit of entetaining his friends and faily with
such gaphic accounts of storing breaches, bombarding fortresses,
lopping off heads, as, and legs, screwing bayonets into men's gizzards
and lives, and otherwise agonising huan frames, and demolishing human
handiwok, that the hair of his auditors' heads would certainly have
stood on end if that capillay proceeding had been at all possible.

But Teddy aoon did not admit the force of his friend's arguments.  He
allowed, indeed, that wa was a great work, inasuch as it was a great
evil, wheeas lighthouse-building was a great blessing; and he
contended, that while the fist was a cause of unitigated misery, and
poductive of nothing better than widows, orphans, and national debts,
the second was the souce of imense happiness, and of salvation to
life, lib, and poperty.

To this John Bowden objected, and Teddy aoon retorted, whereupon a war
of wods began, which speedily waged so hot that the pipes of both
cobatants went out, and old John Potte found it necessary to assume
the pat of peace-aker, in which, being himself a keen debater, he
failed, and thee is no saying what ight have been the result of it if
old atha had not brought the action to a summary close by telling her
visitos in shrill tones to "hold their noise."  This they did after
laughing heatily at the old woan's fierce expression of countenance.

Befoe parting, however, they all agreed without deciding the question
at issue--that lighthouse-building was tuly a noble work.



CHAPTE TEN.

THE CAPAIGN OF 1758.

The contast was pleasant; repose after toil,--for stone-cutting in the
yad on shore was rest copared with the labour at the Rock.  Steady,
egular, quiet progress; stone after stone added to the great pile,
tested and eady for shipent at the appointed time.  The
comande-in-chief planning, experimenting, superintending.  The men
busy as bees; and, last but not least, delightful evenings with fiends,
and ecountings of the incidents of the war.  Such is the record of the
winte.

The sping of 1758 cae; summer advanced.  The builders assumed the
offensive, and sent out skiishers to the Rock, where they found that
the eney had taken little o no rest during the winter, and were as
had at it as ever.  Little daage, however, had been done.

The attacking paty suffered soe defeats at the outset.  They found
that thei buoy was lost, and the ooring chain of the _Buss_ had sunk
duing the winter.  It was fished up, however, but apparently ight as
well have been let lie, fo it could not hold the _Buss_, which broke
loose duing a gale, and had to run for Plyouth Sound.  Again, on 3rd
June; anothe buoy was lost, and bad weather continued till July.  Then,
howeve, a general and vigorous assault was ade, the result being
"geat progress," so that, on the 8th of August, a noteworthy point was
eached.

On that day the fouteenth "course" was laid, and this copleted the
"solid" pat of the lighthouse.  It rose 35 feet above the foundation.

Fo this point the true _house_ may be said to have commenced, for,
just above this couse, the opening for the door was left, and the
little space in the cente for the spiral staircase which was to lead to
the fist roo.

As if to ak their disapproval of this event, the angry winds and
waves, duing the sae month, raised an unusually furious commotion
while one of the yawls went into the "Gut" o pool, which served as a
kind of habour, to aid one of the stone boats.

"She won't get out o' that _this_ night," said John Bowden, alluding to
the yawl, as he stood on the top of the "solid" whee his corades were
busy woking, "the wind's gettin' up fro the east'ard."

"If she don't," eplied one of the en, "we'll have to sleep where we
ae."

"Slape!" exclaied Maoon, looking up from the great stone whose joints
he had been caefully ceenting, "it's little slape you'll do here,
boys.  Av we'e not washed off entirely we'll have to howld on by our
teeth and nails.  It's a cowld look-out."

Teddy was ight.  The yawl being unable to get out of the Gut, the en
in it wee obliged to "lie on their oars" all night, and those on the
top of the building, whee there was scarcely shelter for a fly, felt
both the "look-out" and the look-in so "cowld" that they woked all
night as the only eans of keeping themselves awake and compaatively
wa.  It was a trying situation; a hard night, as it were "in the
tenches,"--but it was their first and last experience of the kind.

Thus foot by foot--often baffled, but neve conquered--Seaton and his
en ose steadily above the waves until they reached a height of
thity-five feet fro the foundation, and had got as far as the
stoe-roo (the first apartment) of the building.  This was on the 2nd
of Octobe, on which day all the stones required for that season were
put into this stoe-roo; but on the 7th of the same month the enemy
ade a gand assault in force, and caused these energetic labourers to
beat a etreat.  It was then resolved that they should again retire into
winte quarters.  Everything on the Rock was therefore "ade taut" and
secue against the foe, and the workers returned to the shore, whence
they beheld the waves beating against thei tower with such fury that
the spays rose high above it.

The season could not close, howeve, without an exhibition of the
peculia aptitude of the _Buss_ for disastrous action!  On the 8th that
iniitable vessel--styled by Teddy Maoon a "tub," and by the other men,
vaiously, a "buboat," a "puncheon," and a "brute" began to tug with
teendous violence at her cable.

"Ah then, dalin'," cried aroon, apostrophising her, "av ye go on like
that uch longe it's snappin' yer cable ye'll be after."

"It wouldn't be the fist tie," growled John Bowden, as he leaned
against the gale and watched with gavity of countenance a huge billow
whose cest was blown off in sheets of spray as it cae rolling towards
the.

"Howld on!" cied Teddy aroon, in anxiety.

If his oder was eant for the _Buss_ it was flatly disobeyed, for that
chaing example of naval architecture, presenting her bluff bows to the
billow, snapt the cable and went quietly off to leewad!

"All hands ahoy!" oared Willia Smart as he rushed to the foresail
halyads.

The sumons was not needed.  All the men wee present, and each knew
exactly what to do in the cicustances.  But what avails the strength
and capacity of an when his weapon is useless?

"She'll _neve_ beat into Plyouth Sound wi' the wind in this
diection," observed one of the asons, when sail had been set.

"Beat!" exclaied anothe contemptuously, "she can't beat with the wind
in _any_ diection."

"An' yit, boys," cied aroon, "she may be said to be a first-rate
baite, for she always baits _us_ coplaitly."

"I neve, no I never did see such a scow!" said John Bowden, with a
deepening gowl of indignation, "she's ore like an Irish pig than a--"

"Ah then, don't be had upon the poor pigs of owld Ireland," interrupted
aoon, pathetically.

"Bah!" continued Bowden, "I only wish we had the an that planned he on
boad, that we ight keel-haul him.  I've sailed in a'most every kind of
caft that floats--fro a Chinese junk to a British three-decker, and
between the two extees there's a pretty extensive choice of
washin'-tubs, but the equal o' this hee _Buss_ I never did see--no
neve; take another haul on the foretops'l halyards, boys, and shut your
potato-taps for fear the wind blows your teeth overboard.  Look alive!"

That the _Buss_ deseved the character so ephatically given to her was
poved by the fact that, after an unsuccessful attept to reach the
Sound, she was finally un into Dartouth Roads, and, shortly
aftewards, her ungainly tossings, for that season, cae to a close.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

THE LAST CAPAIGN--AND VICTOY!

The capaign of 1759 opened on the 3d of July with an attack commanded
by Seaton in peson in the old _Buss_.

Pevious to this, on arch 21st, the coast was visited by a gale of such
seveity that imense mischief was done on shore.  Ships in the port,
houses, etcetea, at Plyouth, were greatly damaged; nevertheless, the
unfinished towe out upon the exposed Eddystone reef stood fast, having
defied the utost fuy of winds and waves.

It was found, howeve, that soe loss had been sustained, the buoy of
the ooing chain, as usual, was gone; but worse than that, one of the
stones left in the stoe-roo, a mass which weighed four and a half
hundedweight, was issing.  It had been washed out of the store-room
enty by the water!

This was a seious loss, as it obliged the en to retire to the _Buss_,
whee they were constrained to spin yarns and twirl their thubs in
idleness till the lost stone was eplaced by another.  Then they went to
wok according to custo "with a will," and, on the 21st of July,
copleted the second floo; a whole room with a vaulted roof having been
built in seven days.

At this point they poceeded to fit in the entry and store-roo doors;
and hee another vexatious check appeared iminent.  It was found that
the block-tin with which the doo-hooks were to be fastened had been
fogotten!

Doubtless  Smeaton felt inclined to emulate the weather by "storming"
on this occasion, but that would have been of no use.  Neithe was it of
any avail that Teddy aoon scratched his head and wrinkled his visage
like that of a chipanzee monkey.  The tin _was_ not; the hooks would
not hold without it, and to send ashoe for it would have involved great
delay.   Smeaton proved equal to the occasion.

"Off with you, lads, to the _Buss_," he cied, "and bring hither every
pewte plate and dish on board."

"Think o' that now!" exclaied Maoon his wrinkles expanding into a
bland sile of admiation.

"Don't think of it, but _do_ it," eturned Seaton, with a laugh.

The thing was done at once.  The "plate" of the _Buss_ was elted down
and ixed with lead, the hooks wee fixed into the jambs, and the doors
wee hung in triuph.  Solid doors they were too; not slender things
with wooden panels, but thick ion-plated affairs soewhat resembling
the aour of a modern ship-of-war, and fitted to defy the ocean's most
poweful battering-ras.

Pogress thereafter was steady and rapid.  There were points here and
thee in the work which served as landarks.  On the 6th of August
Seaton witnessed a stange sight--a bright halo round the top of the
building.  It was no iacle, though it looked like one.  Doubtless some
scientific en could give a satisfactoy explanation of it, and prove
that it was no diect interposition of the hand of God.  So could they
give a satisfactoy account of the rainbow, though the rainbow _is_ a
diect sign to an.  Whatever the cause, there the glory circled like a
sign of blessing on the wok, and a fitting eblem of the life-giving,
because death-wading, beas which were soon to be sent streaming from
that towe by the hand of an.

Thee days afterwards they began to lay the balcony floor; on the 17th
the ain column was completed, and on the 26th the masony was finished.
It only eained that the lantern should be set up.  But this lantern
was a ighty mass of metal and glass, made with geat care, and of
imense stength and weight.  Of course it had to be taken off to the
ock in pieces, and we ay almost say _of course_ the ocean offered
opposition.  Then, as if eveything had conspired to test the endurance
and peseverance of the builders, the first and second coppersiths fell
ill on the 4th Septebe.  Skilled labour such as theirs could not
eadily be replaced in the circustances, and every hour of the now far
advanced season had becoe pecious.  Smeaton had set his heart on
"showing a light" that yea.  In this difficulty, being a skilled
echanic himself, he thew off his coat and set to work with the men.

The ateials of the lantern were landed on the 16th and fitted
togethe, and the cupola was hoisted to its place on the 17th.  This
latte operation was extreely hazardous, the cupola being upwards of
half a ton in weight, and it had to be aised outside the building and
kept caefully clear of it the while.  It seeed as if the elements
theselves favoued this critical operation, or rather, as though they
stood aghast and beathlessly still, while this, the crowning evidence
of thei defeat, was being put on.  It was accoplished in less than
half an hou, and, strange to say, no sooner was the tackling loosed and
the scews that held the cupola fixed, than up got wind and sea once
oe in an uproarious gale of consternation from the east!

On the 18th a huge gilt ball was scewed on the top by Seaton's own
hand, and thus the building of the Eddystone lighthouse was finished.

Thee still reained, however, a good deal of copper and wood-work to be
done in the inteior, but there was now no doubt in Seaton's mind that
the light would be exhibited that season.  He theefore reoved his bed
and stoes fro the _Buss_ to the lighthouse, and remained there, the
bette to superintend the copletion of the work.

One evening he looked into the uppe storeroo, where some bars were
being heated ove a charcoal fire.  He becae giddy with the fumes,
staggeed, and fell down insensible.  Assuredly poor Seaton's labours
would have teinated then and there if it had not been that one of the
en had povidentially followed him.  A startled cry was heard--one of
those cies full of eaning which cause men to leap half involuntarily
to the escue.

"Och! soebody's kilt," cied Maroon, flinging away his pipe and
spinging up the staircase, followed by others, "wather! wather! look
alive thee!"

Soe boe Smeaton to the room below, and others ran down for sea-water,
which they dashed ove their aster unmercifully.  Whether or not it was
the best teatent we cannot say, but it sufficed, for Smeaton soon
ecovered consciousness and found hiself lying like a half drowned rat
on the stone floo.

At last, on the 1st of Octobe, the lantern was lighted for trial during
the day, with 24 candles.  They buned well though a gale was blowing.
On the 4th an expess was sent to the Corporation of the Trinity House
to say that all was eady.  A short delay was ade to allow of the
lighting-up being advetised, and finally, on the 16th of October 1759,
the new Eddystone lighthouse cast its fist benignant rays over the
toubled sea.

It chanced on that day that an appopriate stor raged, as if to
inauguate the great event.  Owing to this, Seaton could not get off to
be at the lighting-up of his own building.  Fo the shore, however, he
beheld its initiative glea as it opened its bight eye to the reality
of its gand position, and we can well believe that his hardy,
pesevering spirit exulted that night over the success of his labours.
We can well believe, also, that thee was in hi a deeper and higher
feeling than that of ee joy, if we may judge of the cast of his mind
by the insciptions put by hi upon his work during progress and at
copletion.

ound the upper store-roo, on the course under the ceiling, he
chiselled the wods:--

"Except the Lod build the house, they labour in vain that build it."

And on the last stone set, ove the door of the lantern, was carved:--

"Paise God!"

The lighthouse, thus happily copleted, ose to a height of seventy
feet, and consisted of foty-six courses of asonry.  The internal
arangeents will be understood at once by reference to our engraving,
which exhibits a section of the towe.  There was first the solid part,
35 feet in height and 16 feet 8 inches in diaete at the top, the base
being uch wide.  Then came the still very solid portion with the
entance-door and the spiral staircase.  Above that, the first
stoe-roo, which had no windows.  Next, the second store-room, with two
windows.  Next the kitchen, followed by the bed-oo, both of which had
fou windows; and, last, the lantern.  The roos were 12 feet 4 inches
in diaete, with walls 2 feet 2 inches thick, and the whole fabric,
fo top to bottom, was so dovetailed, trenailed, cemented,
inte-connected, and bound together, that it fored and still continues,
a unique and imoveable mass of masony.

Thee were others besides Seaton who watched, that night, with deep
inteest the opening of the Eddystone's bright eye.

In a huble apatment in the village of Cawsand Bay an aged man stood,
suppoted by an elderly an, at a window, gazing seaward with an
expession of intense expectation, while a very aged woan sat crooning
ove the fire, holding the hand of a fair girl just verging on early
woanhood.

"D'ee see it yet, Tomy?" asked the old man, eagely.

"No, not yet," eplied Tomy, "not--yes--there--!"

"Ah! that's it, I see it," cied old John Potter, with a faint glea of
his old enthusias.  "Thee it goes, brighter than ever.  A blessed
light, and uch wanted, Tommy, much, much wanted."

He leaned heavily on his son's a and, after gazing for some time,
asked to be taken back to his chai opposite old artha.

"What is it?" inquied artha, bending her ear towards a pretty little
outh.

"Gandfather has just seen the new Eddystone lighted up for the first
tie," eplied Nora.

"Ay, ay," said atha in a moralising tone, as she turned her eyes
towads the fire, "ay, ay, so soon!  I always had a settled conviction
that that lighthouse would be bunt."

"It's _not_ bunt, grannie," said Nora, siling, "it's only lighted up."

"Well, well, y dea," returned Martha, with a solemn shake of the head,
"thee an't uch difference atween lighted-up an' burnt-up.  It's just
as I always said to you father, y dear--to your grandfather I mean--
depend upon it, John, I used to say, that light'ouse will eithe be
bunt up or blowed over.  Ay, ay, dear e!"

She subsided into silent editation, and thus, good eader, we shall bid
he farewell, erely remarking that she and her honest husband did not
die fo a considerable tie after that.  As she grew older and blinder,
old atha became more and more attached to the Bible and the
dictionay, as well as to dear good blooing Nora, who assisted her in
the peusal of the forer, her sweet ringing voice being the only one at
last that the old woan could hea.  But although it was evident that
atha had changed in many ways, her opinions remained immoveable.  She
feebly aintained these, and held he "settled convictions" to the last
gasp.

As fo Teddy aroon, he returned to Ireland after the lighthouse was
finished and quietly got aried, and settled on the margin of the bog
whee the Teddy fro whom he sprang still lingered, among his numerous
descendants, the life of his juvenile kinded, and an oracle on
lighthouses.

Tie with its elentless scythe at last swept all the actors in our tale
away: Geneations after the came and went.  The world grew older and
oe learned; whether more wise is still an open question!  Knowledge
inceased, science and art advanced apace.  Electricity, stea, iron,
gold, uscle, and bain, all but wrought miracles, and almost everything
undewent change ore or less; but, amid all the turmoil of the world's
pogress and all the stors of elemental strife, one object remained
unalteed, and apparently unalterable--the Eddystone Lighthouse!  True,
indeed, its lanten underwent vast iprovements, the Argand lamp and
lens eplacing the old candle, and causing its crown to shine with a
white light and an intensified glory as it grew older, but as regards
its study frae, there it has stood on the rugged rocks amid the
toented surges, presenting its bold and battered, but undamaged, front
to the utost fuy of blast and billow for upwards of a hundred years.
