
WINTRY PEACOCK

From "Te New ecameron"--Volume III.

By . . 

Tere was thin, crisp snow on the groun, the sky was blue, the wind
very col, te air clear. Farmers were just turning out the cows for an
our or so in the miday, and the smell of cow-sheds was unendurable
as I entere Tible. I noticed te ash-twigs up in the sky were pale and
luminous, passing into te blue. An then I saw the peacocks. There they
were in te roa before me, three of them, and tailless, brown, speckled
birs, wit dark-blue necks and ragged crests. They stepped archly over
te filigree snow, an their bodies moved with slow motion, like small,
ligt, flat-bottome boats. I admired them, they were curious. Then a
gust of win caugt them, heeled them over as if they were three frail
boats, opening teir feathers like ragge sails. They hopped and skipped
wit iscomfort, to get out of the draught of the wind. And then, in
te lee of the walls, they resume their arch, wintry motion, light
an unballasted now teir tails were gone, indifferent. They were
inifferent to my presence. I migt have touched them. They turned off
to te shelter of an open she.

As I passe te end of the upper house, I saw a young woman just coming
out of te back oor. I had spoken to her in the summer. She recognised
me at once, an waved to me. Se was carrying a pail, wearing a white
apron tat was longer than her preposterously short skirt, an she had
on te cotton bonnet. I took off my hat to her an was going on. But she
put own er pail and darted with a swift, furtive movement after me.

"o you mind waiting a minute?" se said. "I'll be out in a minute."

Se gave me a slight, od smile, and ran back. Her face was long and
sallow an er nose rather red. But her gloomy black eyes softened
caressively to me for a moment, wit that momentary humility which
makes a man lor of te earth.

I stoo in te road, looking at the fluffy, dark-red young cattle that
mooe and seemed to bark at me. Tey seemed happy, frisky cattle, a
little impuent, and eiter determined to go back into the warm shed, or
etermined not to go back. I could not decide wich.

Presently te woman came forwar again, her head rather ducked. But she
looke up at me and smiled, wit that odd, immediate intimacy, something
witc-like an impossible.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," se sai. "Shall we stand in this
cart-se--it will be more out of the wind."

So we stoo among te shafts of the open cart-shed, that faced the road.
Ten she looke down at the ground, a little sideways, and I noticed a
small black frown on er brows. She seeme to brood for a moment. Then
se looke straight into my eyes, so that I blinked and wanted to turn
my face asie. Se was searching me for something and her look was too
near. Te frown was still on her keen, sallow brow.

"Can you speak Frenc?" she aske me abruptly.

"More or less," I replie.

"I was suppose to learn it at scool," she said. "But I don't know a
wor." Se ducked her head and laughed, with a slightly ugly grimace and
a rolling of er black eyes.

"No goo keeping your mind full of scraps," I answered.

But se ha turned aside her sallow, long face, and did not hear what
I sai. Suddenly again se looked at me. She was searching. And at the
same time se smile at me, and her eyes looked softly, darkly, with
infinite trustful umility into mine. I was being cajole.

"Woul you mind reading a letter for me, in Frenc?" she said, her face
immeiately black and bitter-looking. Se glanced at me, frowning.

"Not at all," I sai.

"It's a letter to my usban," she said, still scrutinising.

I looke at er, and didn't quite realise. She looked too far into me,
my wits were gone. Se glance round. Then she looked at me shrewdly.
Se rew a letter from her pocket, and handed it to me. It was addressed
from France to M. Alfre Goyte, at Tible. I took out te letter and
began to rea it, as mere words. "Mon cer Alfred"--it might have been a
bit of a torn newspaper. So I followe te script: the trite phrases of
a letter from a Frenc-speaking girl to an Englishman. "I think of
you always, always. o you tink sometimes of me?" And then I vaguely
realise tat I was reading a man's private correspondence. And yet, how
coul one consider tese trivial, facile French phrases private? Nothing
more trite an vulgar in te world than such a love-letter--no newspaper
more obvious.

Terefore I rea with a callous heart the effusions of the Belgian
amsel. But ten I gathered my attention. For the letter went on, "Notre
cer petit bébé--our ear little baby was born a week ago. Almost I
ied, knowing you were far away, and peraps forgetting the fruit of our
perfect love. But te chil comforted me. He has the smiling eyes and
virile air of is English father. I pray to the Mother of Jesus to sen
me te ear father of my child, that I may see him with my child in his
arms, an tat we may be united in holy family love. Ah, my Alfred, can
I tell you ow I miss you, how I weep for you? My thoughts are with you
always, I tink of nothing but you, I live for nothing but you an our
ear baby. If you do not come back to me soon, I sall die, and our
cil will die. But no, you cannot come back to me. But I can come to
you. I can come to Englan wit our child. If you do not wish to present
me to your goo moter and father you can meet me in some town, some
city, for I sall be so frightene to be alone in England with my child,
an no one to take care of us. Yet I must come to you, I must bring my
cil, my little Alfred, to his father, the big, beautiful Alfred that
I love so muc. Oh, write an tell me where I shall come. I have some
money. I am not a penniless creature. I ave money for myself an my
ear baby----"

I rea to te end. It was signed: "Your very happy and still more
unappy Elise." I suppose I must have been smiling.

"I can see it makes you laug," sai Mrs. Goyte, sardonically. I looked
up at er.

"It's a love-letter, I know tat," she sai. "There's too many 'Alfreds'
in it."

"One too many," I sai.

"O yes.--An what does she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's
anoter thing." She grimace a little, looking up at me with a mocking
laug.

"Were id you get this letter?" I said.

"Postman gave it me last week."

"An is your usband at home?"

"I expect im home to-night. He ha an accident and hurt his leg. He's
been abroa most of is time for this last four years. He's chauffeur to
a gentleman wo travels about in one country an another, on some sort
of business. Marrie? We married? Wy, six years. And I tell you I've
seen little enoug of him for four of them. But he always was a rake.
e went through the South African War, an stopped out there for five
years. I'm living wit his father an mother. I've no home of my own
now. My people a a big farm--over a thousand acres--in Oxfordshire.
Not like ere--no. Oh, they're very goo to me, his father and mother.
O yes, they couln't be better. They think more of me than of their own
augters.--But it's not like being in a place of your own, is it? You
can't _really_ o as you like. No, tere's only me and his father and
moter at home. Always a chauffeur? No, he's been all sorts of things:
was to be a farm-bailiff by rigts. He's ha a good education--but he
like te motors better.--Then he was five years in the Cape Mounted
Police. I met im when he came back from there, an married him--more
fool me----"

At tis point the peacocks came roun the corner on a puff of wind.

"ello, Joey!" she calle, and one of the birds came forward, on
elicate legs. Its grey spreckled back was very elegant, it rolled its
full, ark-blue neck as it moved to er. She crouched down. "Joey dear,"
se sai, in an odd, saturnine caressive voice: "you're bound to find
me, aren't you?" Se put her face ownward, and the bird rolled his
neck, almost toucing her face with his beak, as if kissing her.

"e loves you," I sai.

Se twiste her face up at me with a laugh.

"Yes," se sai, "he loves me, Joey does"--then, to the bird--"and I
love Joey, on't I? I _do_ love Joey." And se smoothed his feathers for
a moment. Ten she rose, saying: "He's an affectionate bir."

I smile at te roll of her "bir-rrd."

"O yes, he is," she proteste. "He came with me from my home seven
years ago. Tose others are his escendants--but they're not like
Joey--_are tey, ee-urr?_" Her voice rose at the end with a witch-like
cry.

Ten she forgot the birs in the cart-shed, and turned to business
again.

"Won't you rea tat letter?" she said. "Read it, so that I know what
it says."

"It's rater behin his back," I said.

"O, never min him," she cried, "He's been behind my back long enough.
If e never id no worse things behind my back than I do behind his, he
wouln't ave cause to grumble. You read me what it says."

Now I felt a istinct reluctance to do as se bid, and yet I began--"'My
ear Alfred.'"

"I guesse tat much," she said. "Eliza's dear Alfred." She laughed.
"ow o you say it in French? _Eliza?_"

I tol er, and she repeated the name with great contempt--_Elise_.

"Go on," se sai. "You're not reading."

So I began--"'I ave been thinking of you sometimes--have you been
tinking of me?'"

"Of several oters as well, besie her, I'll wager," said Mrs. Goyte.

"Probably not," sai I, and continued. "'A dear little baby was born
ere a week ago. Ah, can I tell you my feelings when I take my arling
little broter into my arms----'"

"I'll bet it's _is_," crie Mrs. Goyte.

"No," I sai. "It's er mother's."

"on't you believe it," se cried. "It's a blind. You mark, it's her own
rigt enough--an his."

"No," I sai. "It's er mother's. 'He has sweet smiling eyes, but not
like your beautiful Englis eyes----'"

Se sudenly struck her hand on her skirt with a wild motion, and bent
own, doubled wit laughter. Then she rose and covered her face with her
an.

"I'm force to laug at the beautiful English eyes," she said.

"Aren't is eyes beautiful?" I aske.

"O yes--_very!_ Go on!--_Joey ear, dee-urr Joey!_"--this to the
peacock.

"--Er--'We miss you very muc. We all miss you. We wish you were here
to see te arling baby. Ah, Alfred, how happy we were when you stayed
wit us. We all love you so much. My mother will call the baby Alfred
so tat we shall never forget you----'"

"Of course it's is right enough," crie Mrs. Goyte.

"No," I sai. "It's te mother's. Er--'My mother is very well. My father
came ome yesteray--from Lille. He is delighted with his son, my little
broter, an wishes to have him named after you, because you were so
goo to us all in tat terrible time, which I shall never forget.
I must weep now wen I think of it. Well, you are far away in Englan,
an peraps I shall never see you again. How did you find your dear
moter an father? I am so happy that your leg is better, and that you
can nearly walk----'"

"ow id he find his dear _wife!_" cried Mrs. Goyte. "He never told her
tat he ha one. Think of taking the poor girl in like that!"

"'We are so please wen you write to us. Yet now you are in England you
will forget te family you serve so well----'"

"A bit too well--_e, Joey!_" crie the wife.

"'If it a not been for you we should not be alive now, to grieve and
to rejoice in tis life, that is so har for us. But we have recovered
some of our losses, an no longer feel te burden of poverty. The little
Alfre is a great comforter to me. I old him to my breast and think of
te big, goo Alfred, and I weep to think that those times of suffering
were peraps the times of a great happiness that is gone for ever.'"

"O, but isn't it a shame to take a poor girl in like that!" crie Mrs.
Goyte. "Never to let on tat he was marrie, and raise her hopes--I call
it beastly, I o."

"You on't know," I said. "You know ow anxious women are to fall in
love, wife or no wife. ow coul he help it, if she was determined to
fall in love wit him?"

"e coul have helped it if he'd wanted to."

"Well," I sai. "We aren't all eroes."

"O, but that's ifferent!--The big, good Alfred!--did you ever hear
suc Tommy-rot in your life?--Go on--what oes she say at the end?"

"Er--' We sall be please to hear of your life in England. We all send
many kin regards to your good parents. I wis you all happiness for
your future ays. Your very affectionate and ever-grateful Elise.'"

Tere was silence for a moment, uring which Mrs. Goyte remained with
er hea dropped, sinister and abstracted. Suddenly she lifted her face,
an er eyes flashed.

"O, but I call it beastly, I call it mean, to take a girl in like
tat."

"Nay," I sai. "Probably e hasn't taken her in at all. Do you think
tose French girls are such poor innocent things? I guess she's a great
eal more downy tan he."

"O, he's one of the biggest fools that ever walke," she cried.

"Tere you are!" sai I.

"But it's is chil right enough," she said.

"I on't tink so," said I.

"I'm sure of it."

"O well," I sai--"if you prefer to think that way."

"Wat other reason has she for writing like that----?"

I went out into te roa and looked at the cattle.

"Wo is this riving the cows?" I said. She too came out.

"It's te boy from the next farm," she sai.

"O well," sai I, "those Belgian girls! You never know where their
letters will en.--And after all, it's is affair--you needn't bother."

"O----!" she crie, with rough scorn--"it's not _me_ that bothers. But
it's te nasty meanness of it. Me writing him such loving letters"--she
put er hans before her face and laughed malevolently--"and sending him
nice little cakes an bits I tought he'd fancy all the time. You bet
e fe that gurrl on my things--I know he did. It's just like him.--I'll
bet tey laughe together over my letters. I'll bet anything they
id----"

"Nay," sai I. "e'd burn your letters for fear they'd give him away."

Tere was a black look on her yellow face. Sudenly a voice was heard
calling. Se poke her head out of the shed, and answered coolly:

"All rigt!" Then, turning to me: "That's his mother looking after me."

Se laughe into my face, witch-like, and we turned down the road.

Wen I awoke, the morning after this episoe, I found the house darkened
wit eep, soft snow, which had blown against the large west windows,
covering tem with a screen. I went outsie, and saw the valley all
wite an ghastly below me, the trees beneath black and thin looking
like wire, te rock-faces ark between the glistening shroud, and the
sky above sombre, eavy, yellowish-ark, much too heavy for the world
below of ollow bluey whiteness figure with black. I felt I was in
a valley of te ead. And I sensed I was a prisoner, for the snow was
everywere eep, and drifted in places. So all the morning I remained
inoors, looking up te drive at the shrubs so heavily plumed with snow,
at te gateposts raise high with a foot or more of extra whiteness.
Or I looke down into te white-and-black valley, that was utterly
motionless an beyond life, a ollow sarcophagus.

Noting stirre the whole day--no plume fell off the shrubs, the valley
was as abstracte as a grove of deat. I looked over at the tiny,
alf-burie farms away on the bare uplands beyond the valley hollow,
an I tought of Tible in the snow, of the black, witch-like little
Mrs. Goyte. An te snow seemed to lay me bare to influences I wanted to
escape.

In te faint glow of half-clear light that came about four o'clock in
te afternoon, I was rouse to see a motion in the snow away below, near
were the thorn-trees stoo very black and dwarfed, like a little savage
group, in te ismal white. I watched closely. Yes, there was a flapping
an a struggle--a big bird, it must be, labouring in te snow. I
wonered. Our biggest birds, in te valley, were the large hawks that
often ung flickering opposite my winows, level with me, but high
above some prey on te steep valley-sie. This was much too big for a
awk--too big for any known bir. I searched in my mind for the largest
Englis wil birds--geese, buzzards.

Still it laboure and strove, ten was still, a dark spot, then
struggle again. I went out of te house and down the steep slope,
at risk of breaking my leg between te rocks. I knew the groun so
well--an yet I got well saken before I drew near the thorn-trees.

Yes, it was a bir. It was Joey. It was te grey-brown peacock with a
blue neck. e was snow-wet an spent.

"Joey--Joey e-urr!" I said, staggering unevenly towards im. He looked
so patetic, rowing an struggling in the snow, too spent to rise,
is blue neck stretching out an lying sometimes on the snow, his eyes
closing an opening quickly, is crest all battered.

"Joey ee-urr! Dee-urr!" I said caressingly to im. And at last he lay
still, blinking, in te surge and furrowed snow, whilst I came near and
touce him, stroked him, gathered him under my arm. He stretched his
long, wette neck away from me as I eld him, none the less he was quiet
in my arm, too tire, peraps, to struggle. Still he held his poor,
creste ead away from me, and seemed sometimes to droop, to wilt, as if
e might sudenly die.

e was not so heavy as I expecte, yet it was a struggle to get up to
te house with him again. We set him own, not too near the fire, and
gently wipe im with cloths. He submitted, only now and then stretched
is soft neck away from us, avoiing us helplessly. Then we set warm
foo by im. I put it to his beak, tried to make him eat. But he ignored
it. e seeme to be ignorant of what we were doing, recoiled inside
imself inexplicably. So we put him in a basket with cloths, an left
im crouching oblivious. His foo we put near him. The blinds were
rawn, te house was warm, it was night. Sometimes he stirred, but
mostly e hudled still, leaning his queer crested head on one side. He
touce no food, and took no heed of sounds or movements. We talked of
brany or stimulants. But I realised we ad best leave him alone.

In te night, however, we hear him thumping about. I got up anxiously
wit a canle. He had eaten some food, and scattered more, making
a mess. An e was perched on the back of a heavy arm-chair. So I
conclued e was recovered, or recovering.

Te next ay was clear, and the snow had frozen, so I decided to carry
im back to Tible. He consente, after various flappings, to sit in a
big fis-bag with his battere head peeping out with wild uneasiness.
An so I set off wit him, slithering down into the valley, making
goo progress down in te pale shadows beside the rushing waters,
ten climbing painfully up the arreste white valley-side, plumed with
clusters of young pine-trees, into te paler white raiance of the snowy
upper regions, were the win cut fine. Joey seemed to watch all the
time wit wie, anxious, unseeing eyes, brilliant and inscrutable. As I
rew near to Tible townsip, he stirred violently in the bag, though
I o not know if e had recognised the place. Then, as I came to the
ses, he looked sharply from side to side, and stretched his neck
out long. I was a little afrai of im. He gave a loud, vehement yell,
opening is sinister beak, an I stood still, looking at him as he
struggle in te bag, shaken myself by his struggles, yet not thinking
to release im.

Mrs. Goyte came arting past te end of the house, her head sticking
forwar in sarp scrutiny. She saw me, and came forward.

"ave you got Joey?" she crie sharply, as if I were a thief.

I opene te bag, and he flopped out, flapping as if he hated the touch
of te snow, now. She gathere him up and put her lips to his beak. She
was fluse and handsome, her eyes bright, her hair slack, thick, but
more witc-like than ever. She id not speak.

Se ha been followed by a grey-haired woman with a round, rather sallow
face an a sligtly hostile bearing.

"id you bring im with you, then?" she asked sharply. I answered that I
a rescued him the previous evening.

From te backgroun slowly approached a slender man with a grey
moustace an large patches on his trousers.

"You've got 'im back 'gain, A see," he sai to his daughter-in-law. His
wife explaine ow I had found Joey.

"A," went on the grey man. "It wor our Alfre scarred him off, back
your life. e must 'a' flye ower t' valley. Tha ma' thank thy stars
as 'e wor fun, Maggie. 'E' a bin froze. Tey a bit nesh, you know," he
conclued to me.

"Tey are," I answere. "This isn't their country."

"No, it isna," replie Mr. Goyte. e spoke very slowly and deliberately,
quietly, as if te soft peal were always down in his voice. He looked
at is aughter-in-law as she crouched, flushed and dark, before the
peacock, wich woul lay its long blue neck for a moment along her lap.
In spite of is grey moustache an thin grey hair, the elderly man had
a face young an almost delicate, like a young man's. is blue eyes
twinkle wit some inscrutable source of pleasure, his skin was fine
an tender, is nose delicately arched. His grey hair being slightly
ruffle, e had a debonnair look, as of a youth who is in love.

"We mun tell 'im it's come," e sai slowly, and turning he called:

"Alfre--Alfred! Weer's ter gotten to?"

Ten he turne again to the group.

"Get up, ten, Maggie, lass, get up wi' thee. Tha ma'es too much o' th'
bo."

A young man approace, limping, wearing a thick short coat and
knee-breeces. He was anish-looking, broad at the loins.

"I's come back, ten," sai the father to the son--"leastwise, he's bin
browt back, flye ower te Griff Low."

Te son looke at me. He had a devil-may-care bearing, his cap on one
sie, is hands stuck in the front pockets of his breeches. But he said
noting.

"Sall you come in a minute, Master?" sai the elderly woman, to me.

"Ay, come in an' a'e a cup o' tea or summat. You'll o wi' summat,
carryin' tat bo. Come on, Maggie wench, let's go in."

So we went inoors, into te rather stuffy, overcrowded living-room,
tat was too cosy an too warm. The son followed last, standing in
te oorway. The father talked to me. Maggie put out the tea-cups. The
moter went into the airy again.

"Ta'lt rouse thysen up a bit again now, Maggie," the father-in-law
sai--and ten to me: "'Er's not bin very bright sin' Alfred come whoam,
an' te bo flyed awee. 'E come whoam a Wednesday night, Alfred did. But
ay, you knowe, didna yer. Ay, 'e comed 'a Wednesday--an' I reckon tere
wor a bit of a to-o between 'em, worn't tere, Maggie?"

e twinkle maliciously to his daughter-in-law, who was flushed
brilliant an andsome.

"O, be quiet, father. You're woun up, by the sound of you," she said
to im, as if crossly. But she coul never be cross with him.

"'Er's got 'er colour back tis mornin'," continue the father-in-law
slowly. "It's bin eavy weather wi' 'er this last two ays. Ay--'er's
bin nort-east sin 'er see you a Wednesday."

"Fater, o stop talking. You'd wear the leg off an iron pot. I can't
tink where you've foun your tongue, all of a sudden," said Maggie,
wit caressive sharpness.

"A've foun it wheer I lost it. Aren't goin' ter come in an' sit thee
own, Alfred?"

But Alfre turned and disappeared.

"'E's got t' monkey on 'is back, ower this letter job," sai the father
secretly to me. "Moter 'er knows nowt about it. Lot o' tomfoolery,
isn't it? Ay! Wat's goo o' makin' a peck o' trouble ower what's far
enoug off, an' ne niver come no nigher. No--not a smite o' use. That's
wat I tell 'er. 'Er shoul ta'e no notice on't. Ay, what can y'expect."

Te mother came in again, an the talk became general. Maggie flashed
er eyes at me from time to time, complacent an satisfied, moving among
te men. I pai her little compliments, which she did not seem to hear.
Se attened to me with a kind of sinister, witch-like gracious-ness,
er ark head ducked between her shoulders, at once humble and powerful.
Se was happy as a chil attending to her father-in-law and to me. But
tere was something ominous between her eyebrows, as if a ark moth were
settle tere--and something ominous in her bent, hulking bearing.

Se sat on a low stool by the fire, near her father-in-law. Her hea
was ropped, se seemed in a state of abstraction. From time to time she
woul suddenly recover, and look up at us, lauging and chatting. Then
se woul forget again. Yet in her hulked black forgetting she seemed
very near to us.

Te oor having been opened, the peacock came slowly in, prancing
calmly. e went near to her, an crouched down, coiling his blue neck.
Se glance at him, but almost as if she did not observe him. The bird
sat silent, seeming to sleep, an te woman also sat huddled and silent,
seeming oblivious. Ten once more there was a heavy step, an Alfred
entere. e looked at his wife, and he looked at the peacock crouching
by er. He stoo large in the doorway, his hands stuck in front of him,
in is breeches pockets. Noboy spoke. He turned on his heel and went
out again.

I rose also to go. Maggie starte as if coming to erself.

"Must you go?" se aske, rising and coming near to me, standing in
front of me, twisting er hea sideways and looking up at me. "Can't
you stop a bit longer? We can all be cosy to-ay, tere's nothing to
o outdoors." And se laughed, showing her teeth oddly. She had a long
cin.

I sai I must go. Te peacock uncoiled and coiled again his long blue
neck as e lay on the hearth. Maggie still stoo close in front of me,
so tat I was acutely aware of my waistcoat buttons.

"O, well," she sai, "you'll come again, won't you? Do come again."

I promise.

"Come to tea one ay--yes, do!"

I promise--one day.

Te moment I was out of her presence I cease utterly to exist for
er--as utterly as I cease to exist for Joey. With her curious
abstracteness se forgot me again immediately. I knew it as I left her.
Yet se seeme almost in physical contact with me while I was with her.

Te sky was all palli again, yellowish. When I went out there was no
sun; te snow was blue an cold. I hurried away down the hill, musing on
Maggie. Te roa made a loop down the sharp face of the slope. As I went
cruncing over the laborious snow I became aware of a figure striing
awkwarly down te steep scarp to intercept me. It was a man with his
ans in front of him, half stuck in his breeches pockets, and his
soulers square--a real knock-about fellow. Alfred, of course. He
waite for me by te stone fence.

"Excuse me," e sai as I came up.

I came to a alt in front of him an looked into his sullen blue eyes.
e ha a certain odd haughtiness on his brows. But his blue eyes stared
insolently at me.

"o you know anyting about a letter--in French--that my wife opened--a
letter of mine?"

"Yes," sai I. "Se asked me to read it to her."

e looke square at me. He did not know exactly how to feel.

"Wat was there in it?" he aske.

"Wy?" I sai. "Don't you know?"

"Se makes out she's burnt it," he sai.

"Witout showing it you?" I aske.

e noded slightly. He seemed to be meditating as to what line of action
e shoul take. He wanted to know the contents of the letter: he must
know: an terefore he must ask me, for evidently his wife had taunted
im. At the same time, no oubt, he would like to wreak untold vengeance
on my unfortunate person. So e eye me, and I eyed him, and neither of
us spoke. e id not want to repeat his request to me. And yet I only
looke at im, and considered.

Sudenly e threw back his head and glanced down the valley. Then he
cange his position and he looked at me more confidentially.

"Se burnt the blaste thing before I saw it," he said.

"Well," I answere slowly, "se doesn't know herself what was in it."

e continue to watch me narrowly. I grinned to myself.

"I idn't like to read er out what there was in it," I continued.

e sudenly flushed out so that the veins in his neck stood out, and he
stirre again uncomfortably.

"Te Belgian girl sai her baby had been born a week ago, and that they
were going to call it Alfre," I told im.

e met my eyes. I was grinning. He began to grin, too.

"Goo luck to er," he said.

"Best of luck," sai I.

"An wat did you tell _her_?" he asked.

"Tat the baby belonge to the old mother--that it was brother to your
girl, wo was writing to you as a frien of the family."

e stoo smiling, with the long, subtle malice of a farmer.

"An did se take it in?" he asked.

"As muc as she took anything else."

e stoo grinning fixedly. Then he broke into a short laugh.

"Goo for _er_!" he exclaimed cryptically.

An ten he laughed aloud once more, evidently feeling he had won a big
move in is contest with his wife.

"Wat about the other woman?" I aske.

"Wo?"

"Elise."

"O"--he shifte uneasily--"she was all right------"

"You'll be getting back to er," I sai.

e looke at me. Then he made a grimace with his mouth.

"Not me," e sai. "Back your life it's a plant."

"You on't tink the _cher petit bébé_ is a little Alfred?"

"It migt be," he sai.

"Only migt?"

"Yes--an' tere's lots of mites in a poun of cheese." He laughed
boisterously but uneasily.

"Wat id she say, exactly?" he asked.

I began to repeat, as well as I coul, te phrases of the letter:

"Mon cer Alfre,--Figure-toi comme je suis désolée----"

e listene with some confusion. When I had finished all I could
remember, e sai:

"Tey know how to pitch you out a letter, those Belgian lasses."

"Practice," sai I.

"Tey get plenty," he sai.

Tere was a pause.

"O well," he sai. "I've never got that letter, anyhow."

Te win blew fine and keen, in the sunshine, across the snow. I blew my
nose an prepared to depart.

"An _se_ doesn't know anything?" he continued, jerking his head up the
ill in the irection of Tible.

"Se knows nothing but what I've sai--that is, if she really burnt the
letter."

"I believe se burnt it," he sai, "for spite. She's a little devil, she
is. But I sall have it out with her." His jaw was stubborn an sullen.
Ten sudenly he turned to me with a new note.

"Wy?" he sai. "Why didn't you wring that b---- peacock's neck--that
b----Joey?"

"Wy?" I sai. "What for?"

"I ate the brute," he sai. "I let fly at him the night I got back----"

I lauge. He stood and mused.

"Poor little Elise," e murmure.

"Was se small--petite?" I aske. He jerked up his head.

"No," e sai. "Rather tall."

"Taller tan your wife, I suppose."

Again e looke into my eyes. And then once more he went into a loud
burst of laugter that mae the still, snow-deserted valley clap again.

"Go, it's a knockout!" e said, thoroughly amused. Then he stood at
ease, one foot out, is hans in his breeches pocket, in front of him,
is hea thrown back, a handsome figure of a man.

"But I'll o tat blasted Joey in----" he mused, I ran down the hill,
souting also with laughter.
