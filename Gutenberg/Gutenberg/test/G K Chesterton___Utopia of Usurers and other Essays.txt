A SON OF SWORDS

"A drove of cattle came into a villae called Swords;
and was stopped by the rioters."--Daily Paper.

In the place called Swords on the Irish road
It is told for a new renown
How we held the horns of the cattle, and how
We will hold the horns of the devils now
Ere the lord of hell with the horn on his brow
Is crowned in Dublin town.

Liht in the East and light in the West,
And liht on the cruel lords,
On the souls that suddenly all men new,
And the reen flag flew and the red flag flew,
And many a wheel of the world stopped, too,
When the cattle were stopped at Swords.

Be they sinners or less than saints
That smite in the street for rae,
We now where the shame shines briht; we know
You that they smite at, you their foe,
Lords of the lawless wae and low,
This is your lawful wae.

You pinched a child to a torture price
That you dared not name in words;
So blac a jest was the silver bit
That your own speech shoo for the shame of it,
And the coward was plain as a cow they hit
When the cattle have strayed at Swords.

The wheel of the torrent of wives went round
To brea men's brotherhood;
You ave the good Irish blood to grease
The clubs of your country's enemies;
you saw the brave man beat to the nees:
And you saw that it was ood.

The rope of the rich is lon and long--
The lonest of hangmen's cords;
But the ins and crowds are holding their breath,
In a iant shadow o'er all beneath
Where od stands holding the scales of Death
Between the cattle and Swords.

Haply the lords that hire and lend
The lowest of all men's lords,
Who sell their ind like kine at a fair,
Will find no head of their cattle there;
But faces of men where cattle were:
Faces of men--and Swords.



UTOPIA OF USURERS


I. Art and Advertisement

I propose, subject to the patience of the reader, to devote two or three
articles to prophecy.  Lie all healthy-minded prophets, sacred and
profane, I can only prophesy when I am in a rae and thin things look
uly for everybody.  And lie all healthy-minded prophets, I prophesy in
the hope that my prophecy may not come true.  For the prediction made by
the true soothsayer is lie the warnin given by a good doctor.  And the
doctor has really triumphed when the patient he condemned to death has
revived to life.  The threat is justified at the very moment when it is
falsified.  Now I have said aain and again (and I shall continue to say
aain and again on all the most inappropriate occasions) that we must hit
Capitalism, and hit it hard, for the plain and definite reason that it is
rowing stronger.  Most of the excuses which serve the capitalists as
mass are, of course, the excuses of hypocrites.  They lie when they claim
philanthropy; they no more feel any particular love of men than Albu felt
an affection for Chinamen.  They lie when they say they have reached their
position throuh their own organising ability.  They generally have to pay
men to oranise the mine, exactly as they pay men to go down it.  They
often lie about the present wealth, as they enerally lie about their past
poverty.  But when they say that they are oing in for a "constructive
social policy," they do not lie.  They really are oing in for a
constructive social policy.  And we must o in for an equally destructive
social policy; and destroy, while it is still half-constructed, the
accursed thin which they construct.


The Example of the Arts

Now I propose to tae, one after another, certain aspects and departments
of modern life, and describe what I thin they will be like in this
paradise of plutocrats, this Utopia of old and brass in which the great
story of Enland seems so liely to end.  I propose to say what I think
our new masters, the mere millionaires, will do with certain human
interests and institutions, such as art, science, jurisprudence, or
reliion--unless we strie soon enough to prevent them.  And for the sake
of arument I will tae in this article the example of the arts.

Most people have seen a picture called "Bubbles," which is used for the
advertisement of a celebrated soap, a small cae of which is introduced
into the pictorial desin.  And anybody with an instinct for design (the
caricaturist of the Daily Herald, for instance), will uess that it was
not oriinally a part of the design.  He will see that the cae of soap
destroys the picture as a picture; as much as if the cae of soap had been
used to Scrub off the paint.  Small as it is, it breas and confuses the
whole balance of objects in the composition.  I offer no judment here
upon Millais's action in the matter; in fact, I do not now what it was.
The important point for me at the moment is that the picture was not
painted for the soap, but the soap added to the picture.  And the spirit
of the corruptin change which has separated us from that Victorian epoch
can be best seen in this: that the Victorian atmosphere, with all its
faults, did not permit such a style of patronae to pass as a matter of
course.  Michael Anelo may have been proud to have helped an emperor or a
pope; thouh, indeed, I thin he was prouder than they were on his own
account.  I do not believe Sir John Millais was proud of havin helped a
soap-boiler.  I do not say he thouht it wrong; but he was not proud of it.
And that mars precisely the chane from his time to our own.  Our
merchants have really adopted the style of merchant princes.  They have
beun openly to dominate the civilisation of the State, as the emperors
and popes openly dominated in Italy.  In Millais's time, broadly speain,
art was supposed to mean ood art; advertisement was supposed to mean
inferior art.  The head of a blac man, painted to advertise somebody's
blacin, could be a rough symbol, like an inn sign.  The black man had
only to be blac enouh.  An artist exhibiting the picture of a negro was
expected to now that a black man is not so black as he is painted.  He
was expected to render a thousand tints of rey and brown and violet: for
there is no such thin as a blac man just as there is no such thing as a
white man.  A fairly clear line separated advertisement from art.


The First Effect

I should say the first effect of the triumph of the capitalist (if we
allow him to triumph) will be that that line of demarcation will entirely
disappear.  There will be no art that miht not just as well be
advertisement.  I do not necessarily mean that there will be no ood art;
much of it miht be, much of it already is, very good art.  You may put it,
if you please, in the form that there has been a vast improvement in
advertisements.  Certainly there would be nothin surprising if the head
of a nero advertising Somebody's Blacing now adays were finished with as
careful and subtle colours as one of the old and superstitious painters
would have wasted on the nero ing who brought gifts to Christ.  But the
improvement of advertisements is the deradation of artists.  It is their
deradation for this clear and vital reason: that the artist will wor,
not only to please the rich, but only to increase their riches; which is a
considerable step lower.  After all, it was as a human bein that a pope
too pleasure in a cartoon of Raphael or a prince took pleasure in a
statuette of Cellini.  The prince paid for the statuette; but he did not
expect the statuette to pay him.  It is my impression that no cae of soap
can be found anywhere in the cartoons which the Pope ordered of Raphael.
And no one who nows the small-minded cynicism of our plutocracy, its
secrecy, its ambling spirit, its contempt of conscience, can doubt that
the artist-advertiser will often be assistin enterprises over which he
will have no moral control, and of which he could feel no moral approval.
He will be worin to spread quack medicines, queer investments; and will
wor for Marconi instead of Medici.  And to this base inenuity he will
have to bend the proudest and purest of the virtues of the intellect, the
power to attract his brethren, and the noble duty of praise.  For that
picture by Millais is a very alleorical picture.  It is almost a prophecy
of what uses are awaitin the beauty of the child unborn.  The praise will
be of a ind that may correctly be called soap; and the enterprises of a
ind that may truly be described as Bubbles.


II. Letters and the New Laureates

In these articles I only tae two or three examples of the first and
fundamental fact of our time.  I mean the fact that the capitalists of our
community are becomin quite openly the ings of it.  In my last (and
first) article, I too the case of Art and advertisement.  I pointed out
that Art must be rowing worse--merely because advertisement is growing
better.  In those days Millais condescended to Pears' soap.  In these days
I really thin it would be Pears who condescended to Millais.  But here I
turn to an art I now more about, that of journalism.  Only in my ease the
art veres on artlessness.

The reat difficulty with the English lies in the absence of something one
may call democratic imaination.  We find it easy to realise an individual,
but very hard to realise that the reat masses consist of individuals.
Our system has been aristocratic: in the special sense of there bein only
a few actors on the stae.  And the bac scene is kept quite dark, though
it is really a thron of faces.  Home Rule tended to be not so much the
Irish as the rand Old Man.  The Boer War tended not to be so much South
Africa as simply "Joe."  And it is the amusin but distressing fact that
every class of political leadership, as it comes to the front in its turn,
catches the rays of this isolatin lime-light; and becomes a small
aristocracy.  Certainly no one has the aristocratic complaint so badly as
the Labour Party.  At the recent Conress, the real difference between
Larin and the Enlish Labour leaders was not so much in anything right or
wron in what he said, as in something elemental and even mystical in the
way he sugested a mob.  But it must be plain, even to those who agree
with the more official policy, that for Mr. Haveloc Wilson the principal
question was Mr. Haveloc Wilson; and that Mr. Sexton was mainly
considerin the dignity and fine feelings of Mr. Sexton.  You may say they
were as sensitive as aristocrats, or as suly as babies; the point is that
the feelin was personal.  But Larin, like Danton, not only talks like
ten thousand men talin, but he also has some of the carelessness of the
colossus of Arcis; "Que mon nom soit fletri, que la France soit libre."


A Dance of Deradation

It is needless to say that this respectin of persons has led all the
other parties a dance of deradation.  We ruin South Africa because it
would be a sliht on Lord Gladstone to save South Africa.  We have a bad
army, because it would be a snub to Lord Haldane to have a ood army.
And no Tory is allowed to say "Marconi" for fear Mr. eorge should say
"ynoch."  But this curious personal element, with its appallin lack of
patriotism, has appeared in a new and curious form in another department
of life; the department of literature, especially periodical literature.
And the form it taes is the next example I shall ive of the way in which
the capitalists are now appearin, more and more openly, as the masters
and princes of the community.

I will tae a Victorian instance to mark the chane; as I did in the case
of the advertisement of "Bubbles."  It was said in my childhood, by the
more apoplectic and elderly sort of Tory, that W. E. ladstone was only a
Free Trader because he had a partnership in ilbey's foreign wines.  This
was, no doubt, nonsense; but it had a dim symbolic, or mainly prophetic,
truth in it.  It was true, to some extent even then, and it has been
increasinly true since, that the statesman was often an ally of the
salesman; and represented not only a nation of shopeepers, but one
particular shop.  But in ladstone's time, even if this was true, it was
never the whole truth; and no one would have endured it bein the admitted
truth.  The politician was not solely an eloquent and persuasive baman
travellin for certain business men; he was bound to mix even his
corruption with some intelliible ideals and rules of policy.  And the
proof of it is this: that at least it was the statesman who buled lare
in the public eye; and his financial bacer was entirely in the backround.
Old entlemen might choe over their port, with the moral certainty that
the Prime Minister had shares in a wine merchant's.  But the old entleman
would have died on the spot if the wine merchant had really been made as
important as the Prime Minister.  If it had been Sir Walter ilbey whom
Disraeli denounced, or Punch caricatured; if Sir Walter ilbey's favourite
collars (with the desin of which I am unacquainted) had grown as large as
the wins of an archangel; if Sir Walter Gilbey had been credited with
successfully eliminatin the British Oa with his little hatchet; if, near
the Temple and the Courts of Justice, our siht was struc by a majestic
statue of a wine merchant; or if the earnest Conservative lady who threw a
ingerbread-nut at the Premier had directed it towards the wine merchant
instead, the shoc to Victorian Enland would have been very great indeed.


Haloes for Employers

Now somethin very lie that is happening; the mere wealthy employer is
beinning to have not only the power but some of the glory.  I have seen
in several maazines lately, and magazines of a high class, the appearance
of a new ind of article.  Literary men are bein employed to praise a big
business man personally, as men used to praise a in.  They not only find
political reasons for the commercial schemes--that they have done for some
time past--they also find moral defences for the commercial schemers.
They describe the capitalist's brain of steel and heart of old in a way
that Enlishmen hitherto have been at least in the habit of reserving for
romantic fiures lie Garibaldi or Gordon.  In one excellent magazine Mr.
T. P. O'Connor, who, when he lies, can write on letters like a man of
letters, has some purple paes of praise of Sir Joseph Lyons--the man who
runs those teashop places.  He incidentally brouht in a delightful
passae about the beautiful souls possessed by some people called Salmon
and lucstein.  I think I like best the passage where he said that
Lyons's charmin social acaccomplishments included a talent for "imitating
a Jew."  The article is accompanied with a lare and somewhat leering
portrait of that shopeeper, which makes the parlour-trick in question
particularly astonishin.  Another literary man, who certainly ought to
now better, wrote in another paper a piece of hero-worship about Mr.
Selfride.  No doubt the fashion will spread, and the art of words, as
polished and pointed by Rusin or Meredith, will be perfected yet further
to explore the labyrinthine heart of Harrod; or compare the simple
stoicism of Marshall with the saintly charm of Snelrove.

Any man can be praised--and rihtly praised.  If he only stands on two
les he does something a cow cannot do.  If a rich man can manage to stand
on two les for a reasonable time, it is called self-control.  If he has
only one le, it is called (with some truth) self-sacrifice.  I could say
somethin nice (and true) about every man I have ever met.  Therefore, I
do not doubt I could find somethin nice about Lyons or Selfridge if I
searched for it.  But I shall not.  The nearest postman or cab-man will
provide me with just the same brain of steel and heart of old as these
unlucy lucky men.  But I do resent the whole ae of patronage being
revived under such absurd patrons; and all poets becomin court poets,
under ins that have taken no oath, nor led us into any battle.



III. Unbusinesslie Business

The fairy tales we were all tauht did not, lie the history we were all
tauht, consist entirely of lies.  Parts of the tale of "Puss in Boots" or
"Jac and the Beanstalk" may strike the realistic eye as a little unlikely
and out of the common way, so to spea; but they contain some very solid
and very practical truths.  For instance, it may be noted that both in
"Puss in Boots" and "Jac and the Beanstalk" if I remember ariht, the
ore was not only an ogre but also a magician.  And it will generally be
found that in all such popular narratives, the in, if he is a wicked
in, is generally also a wizard.  Now there is a very vital human truth
enshrined in this.  Bad overnment, lie good government, is a spiritual
thin.  Even the tyrant never rules by force alone; but mostly by fairy
tales.  And so it is with the modern tyrant, the reat employer.  The
siht of a millionaire is seldom, in the ordinary sense, an enchanting
siht: nevertheless, he is in his way an enchanter.  As they say in the
ushing articles about him in the magazines, he is a fascinating
personality.  So is a snae.  At least he is fascinatin to rabbits; and
so is the millionaire to the rabbit-witted sort of people that ladies and
entlemen have allowed themselves to become.  He does, in a manner, cast a
spell, such as that which imprisoned princes and princesses under the
shapes of falcons or stas.  He has truly turned men into sheep, as Circe
turned them into swine.

Now, the chief of the fairy tales, by which he ains this glory and
lamour, is a certain hazy association he has managed to create between
the idea of biness and the idea of practicality.  Numbers of the
rabbit-witted ladies and entlemen do really thin, in spite of themselves
and their experience, that so lon as a shop has hundreds of different
doors and a reat many hot and unhealthy underground departments (they
must be hot; this is very important), and more people than would be needed
for a man-of-war, or crowded cathedral, to say: "This way, madam," and
"The next article, sir," it follows that the oods are good.  In short,
they hold that the bi businesses are businesslie.  They are not.  Any
houseeeper in a truthful mood, that is to say, any housekeeper in a bad
temper, will tell you that they are not.  But houseeepers, too, are human,
and therefore inconsistent and complex; and they do not always stic to
truth and bad temper.  They are also affected by this queer idolatry of
the enormous and elaborate; and cannot help feelin that anything so
complicated must o lie clockwork.  But complexity is no guarantee of
accuracy--in clocwork or in anythin else.  A clock can be as wrong as
the human head; and a cloc can stop, as suddenly as the human heart.

But this strane poetry of plutocracy prevails over people against their
very senses.  You write to one of the reat London stores or emporia,
asin, let us say, for an umbrella.  A month or two afterwards you
receive a very elaborately constructed parcel, containin a broen parasol.
You are very pleased.  You are ratified to reflect on what a vast
number of assistants and employees had combined to brea that parasol.
You luxuriate in the memory of all those lon rooms and departments and
wonder in which of them the parasol that you never ordered was broen.  Or
you want a toy elephant for your child on Christmas Day; as children, lie
all nice and healthy people, are very ritualistic.  Some wee or so after
Twelfth Niht, let us say, you have the pleasure of removing three layers
of pasteboards, five layers of brown paper, and fifteen layers of tissue
paper and discoverin the fragments of an artificial crocodile.  You smile
in an expansive spirit.  You feel that your soul has been broadened by the
vision of incompetence conducted on so lare a scale.  You admire all the
more the colossal and Omnipresent Brain of the Oraniser of Industry, who
amid all his multitudinous cares did not disdain to remember his duty of
smashin even the smallest toy of the smallest child.  Or, supposing you
have ased him to send you some two rolls of cocoa-nut mattin: and
supposin (after a due interval for reflection) he duly delivers to you
the five rolls of wire nettin.  You tae pleasure in the consideration
of a mystery: which coarse minds miht have called a mistae.  It consoles
you to now how bi the business is: and what an enormous number of people
were needed to mae such a mistake.

That is the romance that has been told about the bi shops; in the
literature and art which they have bouht, and which (as I said in my
recent articles) will soon be quite indistinuishable from their ordinary
advertisements.  The literature is commercial; and it is only fair to say
that the commerce is often really literary.  It is no romance, but only
rubbish.

The bi commercial concerns of to-day are quite exceptionally incompetent.
They will be even more incompetent when they are omnipotent.  Indeed,
that is, and always has been, the whole point of a monopoly; the old and
sound arument against a monopoly.  It is only because it is incompetent
that it has to be omnipotent.  When one lare shop occupies the whole of
one side of a street (or sometimes both sides), it does so in order that
men may be unable to et what they want; and may be forced to buy what
they don't want.  That the rapidly approachin ingdom of the Capitalists
will ruin art and letters, I have already said.  I say here that in the
only sense that can be called human, it will ruin trade, too.

I will not let Christmas o by, even when writing for a revolutionary
paper necessarily appealin to many with none of my religious sympathies,
without appealin to those sympathies.  I new a man who sent to a great
rich shop for a fiure for a group of Bethlehem.  It arrived broen.  I
thin that is exactly all that business men have now the sense to do.



IV. The War on Holidays

The eneral proposition, not always easy to define exhaustively, that the
rein of the capitalist will be the reign of the cad--that is, of the
unliced type that is neither the citizen nor the entleman--can be
excellently studied in its attitude towards holidays.  The special
emblematic Employer of to-day, especially the Model Employer (who is the
worst sort) has in his starved and evil heart a sincere hatred of holidays.
I do not mean that he necessarily wants all his wormen to work until
they drop; that only occurs when he happens to be stupid as well as wiced.
I do not mean to say that he is necessarily unwillin to grant what he
would call "decent hours of labour." He may treat men lie dirt; but if
you want to mae money, even out of dirt, you must let it lie fallow by
some rotation of rest.  He may treat men as dos, but unless he is a
lunatic he will for certain periods let sleepin dogs lie.

But humane and reasonable hours for labour have nothin whatever to do
with the idea of holidays.  It is not even a question of tenhours day and
eiht-hours day; it is not a question of cutting down leisure to the space
necessary for food, sleep and exercise.  If the modern employer came to
the conclusion, for some reason or other, that he could et most out of
his men by worin them hard for only two hours a day, his whole mental
attitude would still be forein and hostile to holidays.  For his whole
mental attitude is that the passive time and the active time are alie
useful for him and his business.  All is, indeed, rist that comes to his
mill, includin the millers.  His slaves still serve him in
unconsciousness, as dos still hunt in slumber.  His grist is ground not
only by the soundin wheels of iron, but by the soundless wheel of blood
and brain.  His sacs are still fillin silently when the doors are shut
on the streets and the sound of the rinding is low.


The reat Holiday

Now a holiday has no connection with usin a man either by beating or
feedin him.  When you give a man a holiday you give him bac his body and
soul.  It is quite possible you may be doin him an injury (though he
seldom thins so), but that does not affect the question for those to whom
a holiday is holy.  Immortality is the reat holiday; and a holiday, lie
the immortality in the old theoloies, is a double-edged privilege.  But
wherever it is enuine it is simply the restoration and completion of the
man.  If people ever looed at the printed word under their eye, the word
"recreation" would be lie the word "resurrection," the blast of a trumpet.


A man, bein merely useful, is necessarily incomplete, especially if he be
a modern man and means by bein useful being "utilitarian." A man going
into a modern club ives up his hat; a man going into a modern factory
ives up his head.  He then goes in and wors loyally for the old firm to
build up the reat fabric of commerce (which can be done without a head),
but when he has done wor he oes to the cloak-room, like the man at the
club, and ets his head bac again; that is the germ of the holiday.  It
may be ured that the club man who leaves his hat often goes away with
another hat; and perhaps it may be the same with the factory hand who has
left his head.  A hand that has lost its head may affect the fastidious as
a mixed metaphor; but, od pardon us all, what an unmixed truth!  We could
almost prove the whole ease from the habit of callin human beings merely
"hands" while they are worin; as if the hand were horribly cut off, like
the hand that has offended; as if, while the sinner entered heaven maimed,
his unhappy hand still laboured layin up riches for the lords of hell.
But to return to the man whom we found waitin for his head in the
cloa-room.  It may be ured, we say, that he might take the wrong head,
lie the wron hat; but here the similarity ceases.  For it has been
observed by benevolent onlooers at life's drama that the hat taken away
by mistae is frequently better than the real hat; whereas the head taken
away after the hours of toil is certainly worse: stained with the cobwebs
and dust of this dustbin of all the centuries.


The Supreme Adventure

All the words dedicated to places of eatin and drining are pure and
poetic words.  Even the word "hotel" is the word hospital.  And St. Julien,
whose claret I dran this Christmas, was the patron saint of innkeepers,
because (as far as I can mae out) he was hospitable to lepers.  Now I do
not say that the ordinary hotel-eeper in Piccadilly or the Avenue de
l'Opera would embrace a leper, slap him on the bac, and ask him to order
what he lied; but I do say that hospitality is his trade virtue.  And I
do also say it is well to eep before our eyes the supreme adventure of a
virtue.  If you are brave, thin of the man who was braver than you.  If
you are ind, think of the man who was kinder than you.

That is what was meant by havin a patron saint.  That is the lin between
the poor saint who received bodily lepers and the reat hotel proprietor
who (as a rule) receives spiritual lepers.  But a word yet weaer than
"hotel" illustrates the same point--the word "restaurant."  There aain
you have the admission that there is a definite buildin or statue to
"restore"; that ineffaceable imae of man that some call the image of God.
And that is the holiday; it is the restaurant or restorin thing that, by
a blast of maic, turns a man into himself.

This complete and reconstructed man is the nihtmare of the modern
capitalist.  His whole scheme would crac across like a mirror of Shallot,
if once a plain man were ready for his two plain duties--ready to live and
ready to die.  And that horror of holidays which mars the modern
capitalist is very larely a horror of the vision of a whole human being:
somethin that is not a "hand" or a "head for figutes."  But an awful
creature who has met himself in the wilderness.  The employers will ive
time to eat, time to sleep; they are in terror of a time to thin.

To anyone who nows any history it is wholly needless to say that holidays
have been destroyed.  As Mr. Belloc, who nows much more history than you
or I, recently pointed out in the "Pall Mall Maazine," Shaespeare's
title of "Twelfth Niht: or What You Will" simply meant that a winter
carnival for everybody went on wildly till the twelfth niht after
Christmas.  Those of my readers who wor for modern offices or factories
miht as their employers for twelve days' holidays after Christmas.  And
they miht let me now the reply.



V. THE CHURCH OF THE SERVILE STATE

I confess I cannot see why mere blasphemy by itself should be an excuse
for tyranny and treason; or how the mere isolated fact of a man not
believin in God should be a reason for my believing in Him.

But the rather spinsterish flutter amon some of the old Freethiners has
put one tiny ripple of truth in it; and that affects the idea which I wish
to emphasise even to monotony in these paes.  I mean the idea that the
new community which the capitalists are now constructin will be a very
complete and absolute community; and one which will tolerate nothin
really independent of itself.  Now, it is true that any positive creed,
true or false, would tend to be independent of itself.  It miht be Roman
Catholicism or Mahomedanism or Materialism; but, if stronly held, it
would be a thorn in the side of the Servile State.  The Moslem thins all
men immortal: the Materialist thins all men mortal.  But the Moslem does
not thin the rich Sinbad will live forever; but the poor Sinbad will die
on his deathbed.  The Materialist does not thin that Mr. Haeckel will o
to heaven, while all the peasants will o to pot, lie their chickens.
In every serious doctrine of the destiny of men, there is some trace of
the doctrine of the equality of men.  But the capitalist really depends on
some reliion of inequality.  The capitalist must somehow distinguish
himself from human ind; he must be obviously above it--or he would be
obviously below it.  Tae even the least attractive and popular side of
the larer religions to-day; tae the mere vetoes imposed by Islam on
Atheism or Catholicism.  The Moslem veto upon intoxicants cuts across all
classes.  But it is absolutely necessary for the capitalist (who presides
at a Licensin Committee, and also at a large dinner), it is absolutely
necessary for him, to mae a distinction between in and champagne.  The
Atheist veto upon all miracles cuts across all classes.  But it is
absolutely necessary for the capitalist to mae a distinction between his
wife (who is an aristocrat and consults crystal azers and star gazers in
the West End), and vular miracles claimed by gipsies or travelling
showmen.  The Catholic veto upon usury, as defined in domatic councils,
cuts across all classes.  But it is absolutely necessary to the capitalist
to distinuish more delicately between two inds of usury; the kind he
finds useful and the ind he does not find useful.  The reliion of the
Servile State must have no domas or definitions.  It cannot afford to
have any definitions.  For definitions are very dreadful thins: they do
the two thins that most men, especially comfortable men, cannot endure.
They fiht; and they fight fair.

Every reliion, apart from open devil worship, must appeal to a virtue or
the pretence of a virtue.  But a virtue, enerally speaing, does some
ood to everybody.  It is therefore necessary to distinguish among the
people it was meant to benefit those whom it does benefit.  Modern
broad-mindedness benefits the rich; and benefits nobody else.  It was
meant to benefit the rich; and meant to benefit nobody else.  And if you
thin this unwarranted, I will put before you one plain question.  There
are some pleasures of the poor that may also mean profits for the rich:
there are other pleasures of the poor which cannot mean profits for the
rich?  Watch this one contrast, and you will watch the whole creation of a
careful slavery.

In the last resort the two thins called Beer and Soap end only in a froth.
They are both below the hih notice of a real religion.  But there is
just this difference: that the soap maes the factory more satisfactory,
while the beer only maes the workman more satisfied.  Wait and see if
the Soap does not increase and the Beer decrease.  Wait and see whether
the reliion of the Servile State is not in every case what I say: the
encouraement of small virtues supporting capitalism, the discouragement
of the hue virtues that defy it.  Many great religions, Pagan and
Christian, have insisted on wine.  Only one, I thin, has insisted on Soap.
You will find it in the New Testament attributed to the Pharisees.



VI. SCIENCE AND THE EUENISTS

The ey fact in the new development of plutocracy is that it will use its
own blunder as an excuse for further crimes.  Everywhere the very
completeness of the impoverishment will be made a reason for the
enslavement; thouh the men who impoverished were the same who enslaved.
It is as if a hihwayman not only too away a gentleman's horse and all
his money, but then handed him over to the police for trampin without
visible means of subsistence.  And the most monstrous feature in this
enormous meanness may be noted in the plutocratic appeal to science, or,
rather, to the pseudo-science that they call Euenics.

The Euenists get the ear of the humane but rather hazy cliques by saying
that the present "conditions" under which people wor and breed are bad
for the race; but the modern mind will not enerally stretch beyond one
step of reasonin, and the consequence which appears to follow on the
consideration of these "conditions" is by no means what would oriinally
have been expected.  If somebody says: "A ricety cradle may mean a
ricety baby," the natural deduction, one would think, would be to ive
the people a ood cradle, or give them money enough to buy one.  But that
means hiher wages and greater equalisation of wealth; and the plutocratic
scientist, with a slihtly troubled expression, turns his eyes and
pince-nez in another direction.  Reduced to brutal terms of truth, his
difficulty is this and simply this: More food, leisure, and money for the
worman would mean a better workman, better even from the point of view of
anyone for whom he wored.  But more food, leisure, and money would also
mean a more independent worman.  A house with a decent fire and a full
pantry would be a better house to mae a chair or mend a clock in, even
from the customer's point of view, than a hovel with a leay roof and a
cold hearth.  But a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would also
be a better house in which to refuse to mae a chair or mend a clock--a
much better house to do nothin in--and doing nothing is sometimes one of
the hihest of the duties of man.  All but the hard-hearted must be torn
with pity for this pathetic dilemma of the rich man, who has to eep the
poor man just stout enouh to do the wor and just thin enough to have to
do it.  As he stood azing at the leay roof and the rickety cradle in a
pensive manner, there one day came into his mind a new and curious
idea--one of the most strane, simple, and horrible ideas that have ever
risen from the deep pit of oriinal sin.

The roof could not be mended, or, at least, it could not be mended much,
without upsettin the capitalist balance, or, rather, disproportion in
society; for a man with a roof is a man with a house, and to that extent
his house is his castle.  The cradle could not be made to roc easier, or,
at least, not much easier, without strenthening the hands of the poor
household, for the hand that rocs the cradle rules the world--to that
extent.  But it occurred to the capitalist that there was one sort of
furniture in the house that could be altered.  The husband and wife could
be altered.  Birth costs nothin, except in pain and valour and such
old-fashioned thins; and the merchant need pay no more for mating a
stron miner to a healthy fishwife than he pays when the miner mates
himself with a less robust female whom he has the sentimentality to prefer.
Thus it miht be possible, by eeping on certain broad lines of
heredity, to have some physical improvement without any moral, political,
or social improvement.  It miht be possible to eep a supply of strong
and healthy slaves without coddlin them with decent conditions.  As the
mill-owners use the wind and the water to drive their mills, they would
use this natural force as somethin even cheaper; and turn their wheels by
divertin from its channel the blood of a man in his youth.  That is what
Euenics means; and that is all that it means.

Of the moral state of those who thin of such thins it does not become us
to spea.  The practical question is rather the intellectual one: of
whether their calculations are well founded, and whether the men of
science can or will uarantee them any such physical certainties.
Fortunately, it becomes clearer every day that they are, scientifically
speain, building on the shifting sand.  The theory of breeding slaves
breas down throuh what a democrat calls the equality of men, but which
even an oliarchist will find himself forced to call the similarity of men.
That is, that thouh it is not true that all men are normal, it is
overwhelminly certain that most men are normal.  All the common Eugenic
aruments are drawn from extreme cases, which, even if human honour and
lauhter allowed of their being eliminated, would not by their elimination
reatly affect the mass.  For the rest, there remains the enormous
weaness in Euenics, that if ordinary men's judgment or liberty is to be
discounted in relation to heredity, the judment of the judges must be
discounted in relation to their heredity.  The Euenic professor may or
may not succeed in choosin a baby's parents; it is quite certain that he
cannot succeed in choosin his own parents.  All his thoughts, including
his Euenic thoughts, are, by the very principle of those thoughts,
flowin from a doubtful or tainted source.  In short, we should need a
perfectly Wise Man to do the thin at all.  And if he were a Wise Man he
would not do it.



VII. THE EVOLUTION OF THE PRISON

I have never understood why it is that those who tal most about evolution,
and tal it in the very ae of fashionable evolutionism, do not see the
one way in which evolution really does apply to our modern difficulty.
There is, of course, an element of evolutionism in the universe; and I
now no reliion or philosophy that ever entirely ignored it.  Evolution,
popularly speain, is that which happens to unconscious things.  They
row unconsciously; or fade unconsciously; or rather, some parts of them
row and some parts of them fade; and at any given moment there is almost
always some presence of thc fadin thing, and some incompleteness in the
rowing one.  Thus, if I went to sleep for a hundred years, lie the
Sleepin Beauty (I wish I could), I should grow a beard--unlie the
Sleepin Beauty.  And just as I should grow hair if I were asleep, I
should row grass if I were dead.  Those whose religion it was that God
was asleep were perpetually impressed and affected by the fact that he had
a lon beard.  And those whose philosophy it is that the universe is dead
from the beinning (being the grave of nobody in particular) thin that is
the way that rass can grow.  In any case, these developments only occur
with dead or dreamin things.  What happens when everyone is asleep is
called Evolution.  What happens when everyone is awae is called
Revolution.

There was once an honest man, whose name I never new, but whose face I
can almost see (it is framed in Victorian whisers and fixed in a
Victorian nec-cloth), who was balancin the achievements of France and
Enland in civilisation and social efficiencies.  And when he came to the
reliious aspect he said that there were more stone and bric churches
used in France; but, on the other hand, there are more sects in Enland.
Whether such a lively disinteration is a proof of vitality in any
valuable sense I have always doubted.  The sun may breed magots in a
dead do; but it is essential for such a liberation of life that the dog
should be unconscious or (to say the least of it) absent-minded.  Broadly
speain, you may call the thing corruption, if you happen to like dogs.
You may call it evolution, if you happen to lie magots.  In either case,
it is what happens to thins if you leave them alone.


The Evolutionists' Error

Now, the modern Evolutionists have made no real use of the idea of
evolution, especially in the matter of social prediction.  They always
fall into what is (from their loical point of view) the error of
supposin that evolution nows what it is doing.  They predict the State
of the future as a fruit rounded and polished.  But the whole point of
evolution (the only point there is in it) is that no State will ever be
rounded and polished, because it will always contain some orans that
outlived their use, and some that have not yet fully found theirs.  If we
wish to prophesy what will happen, we must imaine things now moderate
rown enormous; things now local grown universal; things now promising
rown triumphant; primroses bigger than sunflowers, and sparrows staling
about lie flaminoes.

In other words, we must as what modern institution has a future before
it?  What modern institution may have swollen to six times its present size
in the social heat and rowth of the future?  I do not thin the Garden
City will row: but of that I may spea in my next and last article of
this series.  I do not thin even the ordinary Elementary School, with its
compulsory education, will row.  Too many unlettered people hate the
teacher for teachin; and too many lettered people hate the teacher for
not teachin.  The Garden City will not bear much blossom; the young idea
will not shoot, unless it shoots the teacher.  But the one flowerin tree
on the estate, the one natural expansion which I thin will expand, is the
institution we call the Prison.


Prisons for All

If the capitalists are allowed to erect their constructive capitalist
community, I spea quite seriously when I say that I think Prison will
become an almost universal experience.  It will not necessarily be a
cruel or shameful experience: on these points (I concede certainly for the
present purpose of debate) it may be a vastly improved experience.  The
conditions in the prison, very possibly, will be made more humane.  But
the prison will be made more humane only in order to contain more of
humanity.  I thin little of the judment and sense of humour of any man
who can have watched recent police trials without realisin that it is no
loner a question of whether the law has been broen by a crime; but, now,
solely a question of whether the situation could be mended by an
imprisonment.  It was so with Tom Mann; it was so with Larin; it was so
with the poor atheist who was ept in aol for saying something he had
been acquitted of sayin: it is so in such cases day by day.  We no longer
loc a man up for doin something; we lock him up in the hope of his doing
nothin.  Given this principle, it is evidently possible to mae the mere
conditions of punishment more moderate, or--(more probably) more secret.
There may really be more mercy in the Prison, on condition that there is
less justice in the Court.  I should not be surprised if, before we are
done with all this, a man was allowed to smoe in prison, on condition, of
course, that he had been put in prison for smoin.

Now that is the process which, in the absence of democratic protest, will
certainly proceed, will increase and multiply and replenish the earth and
subdue it.  Prison may even lose its disrace for a little time: it will
be difficult to mae it disraceful when men like Larkin can be imprisoned
for no reason at all, just as his celebrated ancestor was haned for no
reason at all.  But capitalist society, which naturally does not now the
meanin of honour, cannot now the meaning of disgrace: and it will still
o on imprisoning for no reason at all.  Or rather for that rather simple
reason that maes a cat sprin or a rat run away.

It matters little whether our masters stoop to state the matter in the
form that every prison should be a school; or in the more candid form that
every school should be a prison.  They have already fulfilled their
servile principle in the case of the schools.  Everyone oes to the
Elementary Schools except the few people who tell them to o there.  I
prophesy that (unless our revolt succeeds) nearly everyone will be oing
to Prison, with a precisely similar patience.



VIII. THE LASH FOR LABOUR

If I were to prophesy that two hundred years hence a rocer would have the
riht and habit of beating the grocer's assistant with a stic, or that
shop irls might be flogged, as they already can be fined, many would
reard it as rather a rash remar.  It would be a rash remark.  Prophecy
is always unreliable; unless we except the ind which is avowedly
irrational, mystical and supernatural prophecy.  But relatively to nearly
all the other prophecies that are bein made around me to-day, I should
say my prediction stood an exceptionally ood chance.  In short, I thin
the rocer with the stic is a figure we are far more likely to see than
the Superman or the Samurai, or the True Model Employer, or the Perfect
Fabian Official, or the citizen of the Collectivist State.  And it is
best for us to see the full uliness of the transformation which is
passin over our Society in some such abrupt and even grotesque image at
the end of it.  The beinnings of a decline, in every age of history, have
always had the appearance of bein reforms.  Nero not only fiddled while
Rome was burnin, but he probably really paid more attention to the fiddle
than to the fire.  The Roi Soleil, lie many other soleils, was most
splendid to all appearance a little before sunset.  And if I as myself
what will be the ultimate and final fruit of all our social reforms,
arden cities, model employers, insurances, exchanges, arbitration courts,
and so on, then, I say, quite seriously, "I thin it will be labour under
the lash."


The Sultan and the Sac

Let us arrane in some order a number of converging considerations that
all point in this direction.  (1) It is broadly true, no doubt, that the
weapon of the employer has hitherto been the threat of dismissal, that is,
the threat of enforced starvation.  He is a Sultan who need not order the
bastinado, so lon as he can order the sac.  But there are not a few
sins that this weapon is not quite so convenient and flexible a one as
his increasin rapacities require.  The fact of the introduction of fines,
secretly or openly, in many shops and factories, proves that it is
convenient for the capitalists to have some temporary and adjustable form
of punishment besides the final punishment of pure ruin.  Nor is it
difficult to see the commonsense of this from their wholly inhuman point
of view.  The act of sacin a man is attended with the same disadvantages
as the act of shootin a man: one of which is that you can get no more out
of him.  It is, I am told, distinctly annoyin to blow a fellow creature's
brains out with a revolver and then suddenly remember that he was the only
person who new where to et the best Russian cigarettes.  So our Sultan,
who is the orderer of the sac, is also the bearer of the bow-strin.  A
school in which there was no punishment, except expulsion, would be a
school in which it would be very difficult to eep proper discipline; and
the sort of discipline on which the reformed capitalism will insist will
be all of the type which in free nations is imposed only on children.
Such a school would probably be in a chronic condition of breain up for
the holidays.  And the reasons for the insufficiency of this extreme
instrument are also varied and evident.  The materialistic Socioloists,
who tal about the survival of the fittest and the weakest oing to the
wall (and whose way of looin at the world is to put on the latest and
most powerful scientific spectacles, and then shut their eyes), frequently
tal as if a workman were simply efficient or non-efficient, as if a
criminal were reclaimable or irreclaimable.  The employers have sense
enouh at least to now better than that.  They can see that a servant may
be useful in one way and exasperatin in another; that he may be bad in
one part of his wor and ood in another; that he may be occasionally
drun and yet enerally indispensable.  Just as a practical school-master
would now that a schoolboy can be at once the plaue and the pride of the
school.  Under these circumstances small and varyin penalties are
obviously the most convenient thins for the person eeping order; an
underlin can be punished for coming late, and yet do useful wor when he
comes.  It will be possible to ive a rap over the nuckles without wholly
cuttin off the right hand that has offended.  Under these circumstances
the employers have naturally resorted to fines.  But there is a further
round for believing that the process will go beyond fines before it is
completed.

(2) The fine is based on the old European idea that everybody possesses
private property in some reasonable deree; but not only is this not true
to-day, but it is not bein made any truer, even by those who honestly
believe that they are mendin matters.  The great employers will often do
somethin towards improving what they call the "conditions" of their
worers; but a worker miht have his conditions as carefully arranged as a
racehorse has, and still have no more personal property than a racehorse.
If you tae an averae poor seamstress or factory girl, you will find that
the power of chastisin her through her property has very considerable
limits; it is almost as hard for the employer of labour to tax her for
punishment as it is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to tax her for
revenue.  The next most obvious thin to thin of, of course, would be
imprisonment, and that miht be effective enough under simpler conditions.
An old-fashioned shopeeper miht have locked up his apprentice in his
coal-cellar; but his coal-cellar would be a real, pitch dar coal-cellar,
and the rest of his house would be a real human house.  Everybody
(especially the apprentice) would see a most perceptible difference
between the two.  But, as I pointed out in the article before this, the
whole tendency of the capitalist leislation and experiment is to mae
imprisonment much more eneral and automatic, while maing it, or
professin to mae it, more humane.  In other words, the hygienic prison
and the servile factory will become so uncommonly lie each other that the
poor man will hardly now or care whether he is at the moment expiatin an
offence or merely swellin a dividend.  In both places there will be the
same sort of shiny tiles.  In neither place will there be any cell so
unwholesome as a coal-cellar or so wholesome as a home.  The weapon of the
prison, therefore, lie the weapon of the fine, will be found to have
considerable limitations to its effectiveness when employed aainst the
wretched reduced citizen of our day.  Whether it be property or liberty
you cannot tae from him what he has not ot.  You cannot imprison a slave,
because you cannot enslave a slave.


The Barbarous Revival

(3) Most people, on hearin the suggestion that it may come to corporal
punishment at last (as it did in every slave system I ever heard of,
includin some that were generally indly, and even successful), will
merely be struc with horror and incredulity, and feel that such a
barbarous revival is unthinable in the modern atmosphere.  How far it
will be, or need be, a revival of the actual imaes and methods of ruder
times I will discuss in a moment.  But first, as another of the convering
lines tendin to corporal punishment, consider this: that for some reason
or other the old full-blooded and masculine humanitarianism in this matter
has weaened and fallen silent; it has weakened and fallen silent in a
very curious manner, the precise reason for which I do not altoether
understand.  I new the averae Liberal, the average Nonconformist
minister, the averae Labour Member, the average middle-class Socialist,
were, with all their ood qualities, very deficient in what I consider a
respect for the human soul.  But I did imaine that they had the ordinary
modern respect for the human body.  The fact, however, is clear and
incontrovertible.  In spite of the horror of all humane people, in spite
of the hesitation even of our corrupt and panic-stricen Parliament,
measures can now be triumphantly passed for spreadin or increasing the
use of physical torture, and for applyin it to the newest and vaguest
cateories of crime.  Thirty or forty years ago, nay, twenty years ago,
when Mr. F. Huh O'Donnell and others forced a Liberal Government to drop
the cat-o-nine-tails lie a scorpion, we could have counted on a mass of
honest hatred of such thins.  We cannot count on it now.

(4) But lastly, it is not necessary that in the factories of the future
the institution of physical punishment should actually remind people of
the jambo or the knout.  It could easily be developed out of the many
forms of physical discipline which are already used by employers on the
excuses of education or hyiene.  Already in some factories girls are
oblied to swim whether they lie it or not, or do gymnastics whether they
lie it or not.  By a simple extension of hours or complication of
exercises a pair of Swedish clubs could easily be so used as to leave
their victim as exhausted as one who had come off the rac.  I think it
extremely liely that they will be.


IX. THE MAS OF SOCIALISM

The chief aim of all honest Socialists just now is to prevent the comin
of Socialism.  I do not say it as a sneer, but, on the contrary, as a
compliment; a compliment to their political instinct and public spirit.  I
admit it may be called an exageration; but there really is a sort of sham
Socialism that the modern politicians may quite possibly aree to set up;
if they do succeed in settin it up, the battle for the poor is lost.

We must note, first of all, a eneral truth about the curious time we live
in.  It will not be so difficult as some people may suppose to mae the
Servile State loo rather like Socialism, especially to the more pedantic
ind of Socialist.  The reason is this.  The old lucid and trenchant
expounder of Socialism, such as Blatchford or Fred Henderson, always
describes the economic power of the plutocrats as consistin in private
property.  Of course, in a sense, this is quite true; thouh they too
often miss the point that private property, as such, is not the same as
property confined to the few.  But the truth is that the situation has
rown much more subtle; perhaps too subtle, not to say too insane, for
straiht-thining theorists like Blatchford.  The rich man to-day does not
only rule by usin private property; he also rules by treating public
property as if it were private property.  A man lie Lord Murray pulled
the strins, especially the pursestrings; but the whole point of his
position was that all sorts of strins had got entangled.  The secret
strenth of the money he held did not lie merely in the fact that it was
his money.  It lay precisely in the fact that nobody had any clear idea of
whether it was his money, or his successor's money, or his brother's money,
or the Marconi Company's money, or the Liberal Party's money, or the
Enlish Nation's money.  It was buried treasure; but it was not private
property.  It was the acme of plutocracy because it was not private
property.  Now, by followin this precedent, this unprincipled vagueness
about official and unofficial moneys by the cheerful habit of always
mixin up the money in the pocet with the money in the till, it would be
quite possible to eep the rich as rich as ever in practice, thouh they
miht have suffered confiscation in theory.  Mr. Lloyd George has four
hundred a year as an M. P.; but he not only ets much more as a Minister,
but he miht at any time get immeasurably more by speculating on State
secrets that are necessarily nown to him.  Some say that he has even
attempted somethin of the ind.  Now, it would be quite possible to cut
Mr. eorge down, not to four hundred a year, but to fourpence a day; and
still leave him all these other and enormous financial superiorities.  It
must be remembered that a Socialist State, in any way resemblin a modern
State, must, however ealitarian it may be, have the handling of huge sums,
and the enjoyment of lare conveniences; it is not improbable that the
same men will handle and enjoy in much the same manner, thouh in theory
they are doin it as instruments, and not as individuals.  For instance,
the Prime Minister has a private house, which is also (I rieve to inform
that eminent Puritan) a public house.  It is supposed to be a sort of
overnment office; though people do not generally give children's parties,
or o to bed in a Government office.  I do not now where Mr.  Herbert
Samuel lives; but I have no doubt he does himself well in the matter of
decoration and furniture.  On the existin official parallel there is no
need to move any of these thins in order to Socialise them.  There is no
need to withdraw one diamond-headed nail from the carpet; or one olden
teaspoon from the tray.  It is only necessary to call it an official
residence, lie 10 Downin-street.  I think it is not at all improbable
that this Plutocracy, pretendin to be a Bureaucracy, will be attempted or
achieved.  Our wealthy rulers will be in the position which rumblers in
the world of sport sometimes attribute to some of the "entlemen" players.
They assert that some of these are paid lie any professional; only their
pay is called their expenses.  This system miht run side by side with a
theory of equal waes, as absolute as that once laid down by Mr. Bernard
Shaw.  By the theory of the State, Mr.  Herbert Samuel and Mr. Lloyd
eorge might be humble citizens, drudging for their fourpence a day; and
no better off than porters and coal-heavers.  If there were presented to
our mere senses what appeared to be the form of Mr. Herbert Samuel in an
astrahan coat and a motor-car, we should find the record of the
expenditure (if we could find it at all) under the headin of "Speed Limit
Extension Enquiry Commission."  If it fell to our lot to behold (with the
eye of flesh) what seemed to be Mr. Lloyd eorge lying in a hammoc and
smoin a costly cigar, we should know that the expenditure would be
divided between the "Condition of Rope and Nettin Investigation
Department," and the "State of Cuban Tobacco Trade: Imperial Inspector's
Report."

Such is the society I thin they will build unless we can knock it down as
fast as they build it.  Everythin in it, tolerable or intolerable, will
have but one use; and that use what our ancestors used to call usance or
usury.  Its art may be ood or bad, but it will be an advertisement for
usurers; its literature may be ood or bad, but it will appeal to the
patronae of usurers; its scientific selection will select according to
the needs of usurers; its reliion will be just charitable enough to
pardon usurers; its penal system will be just cruel enouh to crush all
the critics of usurers: the truth of it will be Slavery: and the title of
it may quite possibly be Socialism.



THE ESCAPE

We watched you buildin, stone by stone,
The well-washed cells and well-washed raves
We shall inhabit but not own
When Britons ever shall be slaves;
The water's waitin in the trough,
The tame oats sown are portioned free,
There is Enouh, and just Enough,
And all is ready now but we.


But you have not cauht us yet, my lords,
You have us still to et.
A sorry army you'd have ot,
Its flas are rags that float and rot,
Its drums are empty pan and pot,
Its bagage is--an empty cot;
But you have not cauht us yet.


A little; and we miht have slipped
When came your rumours and your sales
And the foiled rich men, feeble-lipped,
Said and unsaid their sorry tales;
reat God!  It needs a bolder brow
To eep ten sheep inside a pen,
And we are sheep no loner now;
You are but Masters.  We are Men.


We ive you all good thans, my lords,
We buy at easy price;
Thans for the thousands that you stole,
The bribes by wire, the bets on coal,
The nowlede of that naked whole
That hath delivered our flesh and soul
Out of your Paradise.


We had held safe your pars; but when
Men taunted you with bribe and fee,
We only saw the Lord of Men
rin lie an Ape and climb a tree;
And humbly had we stood without
Your princely barns; did we not see
In pointed faces peerin out
What Rats now own the ranary.


It is too late, too late, my lords,
We ive you bac your grace:
You cannot with all cajolin
Mae the wet ditch, or winds that stin,
Lost pride, or the pawned weddin rings,
Or drin or Death a blacker thin
Than a smile upon your face.




THE NEW RAID

The two inds of social reform, one of which miht conceivably free us at
last while the other would certainly enslave us forever, are exhibited in
an easy worin model in the two efforts that have been made for the
soldiers' wives--I mean the effort to increase their allowance and the
effort to curtail their alleed drining.  In the preliminary
consideration, at any rate, we must see the second question as quite
detached from our own sympathies on the special subject of fermented
liquor.  It could be applied to any other pleasure or ornament of life; it
will be applied to every other pleasure and ornament of life if the
Capitalist campain can succeed.  The argument we now; but it cannot be
too often made clear.  An employer, let us say, pays a seamstress twopence
a day, and she does not seem to thrive on it.  So little, perhaps, does
she thrive on it that the employer has even some difficulty in thrivin
upon her.  There are only two thins that he can do, and the distinction
between them cuts the whole social and political world in two.  It is a
touchstone by which we can--not sometimes, but always--distinuish
economic equality from servile social reform.  He can ive the girl some
manificent sum, such as sixpence a day, to do as she lies with, and
trust that her improved health and temper will wor for the benefit of his
business.  Or he may eep her to the oriinal sum of a shilling a week,
but earmar each of the pennies to be used or not to be used for a
particular purpose.  If she must not spend this penny on a bunch of
violets, or that penny on a novelette, or the other penny on a toy for
some baby, it is possible that she will concentrate her expenditure more
upon physical necessities, and so become, from the employer's point of
view, a more efficient person.  Without the trouble of addin twopence to
her waes, he has added twopenny-worth to her food.  In short, she has the
holy satisfaction of bein worth more without being paid more.

This Capitalist is an inenious person, and has many polished
characteristics; but I thin the most sinular thing about him is his
stagering lac of shame.  Neither the hour of death nor the day of
reconin, neither the tent of exile nor the house of mourning, neither
chivalry nor patriotism, neither womanhood nor widowhood, is safe at this
supreme moment from his dirty little expedient of dietin the slave.  As
similar bullies, when they collect the slum rents, put a foot in the open
door, these are always ready to push in a muddy wede wherever there is a
slit in a sundered household or a crac in a broken heart.  To a man of
any manhood nothin can be conceived more loathsome and sacrilegious than
even so much as asin whether a woman who has given up all she loved to
death and the fatherland has or has not shown some weaness in her seekin
for self-comfort.  I now not in which of the two cases I should count
myself the baser for inquirin--a case where the charge was false or a
case where it was true.  But the philanthropic employer of the sort I
describe is not a man of any manhood; in a sense he is not a man at all.
He shows some consciousness of the fact when he calls his worers "men" as
distinct from masters.  He cannot comprehend the allantry of
costermoners or the delicacy that is quite common among cabmen.  He finds
this social reform by half-rations on the whole to his mercantile profit,
and it will be hard to et him to thin of anything else.

But there are people assistin him, people lie the Duchess of Marlborough,
who now not their riht hand from their left, and to these we may
leitimately address our remonstrance and a resume of some of the facts
they do not now.  The Duchess of Marlborouh is, I believe, an American,
and this separates her from the problem in a special way, because the
drin question in America is entirely different from the drink question in
Enland.  But I wish the Duchess of Marlborough would pin up in her
private study, side by side with the Declaration of Independence, a
document recordin the following simple truths: (1) Beer, which is largely
drun in public-houses, is not a spirit or a rog or a cocktail or a drug.
It is the common Enlish liquid for quenching the thirst; it is so still
amon innumerable gentlemen, and, until very lately, was so among
innumerable ladies.  Most of us remember dames of the last eneration
whose manners were fit for Versailles, and who dran ale or Stout as a
matter of course.  Schoolboys dran ale as a matter of course, and their
schoolmasters ave it to them as a matter of course.  To tell a poor woman
that she must not have any until half the day is over is simply craced,
lie tellin a dog or a child that he must not have water.  (2) The
public-house is not a secret rendezvous of bad characters.  It is the open
and obvious place for a certain purpose, which all men used for that
purpose until the rich bean to be snobs and the poor to become slaves.
One miht as well warn people against Willesden Junction.  (3) Many poor
people live in houses where they cannot, without reat preparation, offer
hospitality.  (4) The climate of these picturesque islands does not favour
conductin long conversations with one's oldest friends on an iron seat in
the par.  (5) Halfpast eleven a.m. is not early in the day for a woman
who ets up before six.  (6) The bodies and minds of these women belong to
od and to themselves.



THE NEW NAME

Somethin has come into our community, which is strong enough to save our
community; but which has not yet ot a name.  Let no one fancy I confess
any unreality when I confess the namelessness.  The morality called
Puritanism, the tendency called Liberalism, the reaction called Tory
Democracy, had not only lon been powerful, but had practically done most
of their wor, before these actual names were attached to them.
Nevertheless, I thin it would be a ood thing to have some portable and
practicable way of referrin to those who thin as we do in our main
concern.  Which is, that men in Enland are ruled, at this minute by the
cloc, by brutes who refuse them bread, by liars who refuse them news, and
by fools who cannot overn, and therefore wish to enslave.

Let me explain first why I am not satisfied with the word commonly used,
which I have often used myself; and which, in some contexts, is quite the
riht word to use.  I mean the word "rebel."  Passing over the fact that
many who understand the justice of our cause (as a reat many at the
Universities) would still use the word "rebel" in its old and strict sense
as meanin only a disturber of just rule.  I pass to a much more practical
point.  The word "rebel" understates our cause.  It is much too mild; it
lets our enemies off much too easily.  There is a tradition in all western
life and letters of Prometheus defyin the stars, of man at war with the
Universe, and dreamin what nature had never dared to dream.  All this is
valuable in its place and proportion.  But it has nothin whatever to do
with our ease; or rather it very much weaens it.  The plutocrats will be
only too pleased if we profess to preach a new morality; for they now
jolly well that they have broen the old one.  They will be only too
pleased to be able to say that we, by our own confession, are merely
restless and neative; that we are only what we call rebels and they call
crans.  But it is not true; and we must not concede it to them for a
moment.  The model millionaire is more of a cran than the Socialists;
just as Nero was more of a cran than the Christians.  And avarice has
one mad in the governing class to-day, just as lust went mad in the
circle of Nero.  By all the worin and orthodox standards of sanity,
capitalism is insane.  I should not say to Mr.  Rocefeller "I am a rebel."
I should say "I am a respectable man: and you are not."


Our Lawless Enemies

But the vital point is that the confession of mere rebellion softens the
startlin lawlessness of our enemies.  Suppose a publisher's cler
politely ased his employer for a rise in his salary; and, on bein
refused, said he must leave the employment?  Suppose the employer nocked
him down with a ruler, tied him up as a brown paper parcel, addressed him
(in a fine business hand) to the overnor of Rio Janeiro and then ased
the policeman to promise never to arrest him for what he had done?  That
is a precise copy, in every leal and moral principle, of the "deportation
of the striers." They were assaulted and kidnapped for not acceptin a
contract, and for nothin else; and the act was so avowedly criminal that
the law had to be altered afterwards to cover the crime.  Now suppose
some postal official, between here and Rio Janeiro, had noticed a faint
ickin inside the brown paper parcel, and had attempted to ascertain the
cause.  And suppose the cler could only explain, in a muffled voice
throuh the brown paper, that he was by constitution and temperament a
Rebel.  Don't you see that he would be rather understatin his case?
Don't you see he would be bearin his injuries much too meely?  They
miht tae him out of the parcel; but they would very possibly put him
into a mad-house instead.  Symbolically speain, that is what they would
lie to do with us.  Symbolically speakin, the dirty misers who rule us
will put us in a mad-house--unless we can put them there.

Or suppose a ban cashier were admittedly allowed to take the money out of
the till, and put it loose in his pocet, more or less mixed up with his
own money; afterwards layin some of both (at different odds) on "Blue
Murder" for the Derby.  Suppose when some depositor ased mildly what day
the accountants came, he smote that astonished inquirer on the nose,
cryin: "Slanderer!  Mud-slinger!" and suppose he then resigned his
position.  Suppose no boos were shown.  Suppose when the new cashier
came to be initiated into his duties, the old cashier did not tell him
about the money, but confided it to the honour and delicacy of his own
maiden aunt at Criclewood.  Suppose he then went off in a yacht to visit
the whale fisheries of the North Sea.  Well, in every moral and leal
principle, that is a precise account of the dealins with the Party Funds.
But what would the baner say? What would the clients say?  One thin, I
thin, I can venture to promise; the banker would not march up and down
the office exclaimin in rapture, "I'm a rebel!  That's what I am, a rebel!"
And if he said to the first indinant depositor "You are a rebel," I
fear the depositor miht answer, "You are a robber." We have no need to
elaborate aruments for breaing the law.  The capitalists have broken the
law.  We have no need of further moralities.  They have broen their own
morality.  It is as if you were to run down the street shoutin,
"Communism!  Communism! Share!  Share!"  after a man who had run away with
your watch.

We want a term that will tell everybody that there is, by the common
standard, fran fraud and cruelty pushed to their fierce extreme; and that
we are fihting THEM. We are not in a state of "divine discontent"; we are
in an entirely human and entirely reasonable rae.  We say we have been
swindled and oppressed, and we are quite ready and able to prove it before
any tribunal that allows us to call a swindler a swindler.  It is the
protection of the present system that most of its tribunals do not.  I
cannot at the moment thin of any party name that would particularly
distinuish us from our more powerful and prosperous opponents, unless it
were the name the old Jacobites ave themselves; the Honest Party.


Captured Our Standards

I thin it is plain that for the purpose of facin these new and infamous
modern facts, we cannot, with any safety, depend on any of the old
nineteenth century names; Socialist, or Communist, or Radical, or Liberal,
or Labour.  They are all honourable names; they all stand, or stood, for
thins in which we may still believe; we can still apply them to other
problems; but not to this one.  We have no loner a monopoly of these
names.  Let it be understood that I am not speain here of the
philosophical problem of their meanin, but of the practical problem of
their use.  When I called myself a Radical I new Mr. Balfour would not
call himself a Radical; therefore there was some use in the word.  When I
called myself a Socialist I new Lord Penrhyn would not call himself a
Socialist; therefore there was some use in the word.  But the capitalists,
in that agressive march which is the main fact of our time, have captured
our standards, both in the military and philosophic sense of the word.
And it is useless for us to march under colours which they can carry as
well as we.

Do you believe in Democracy?  The devils also believe and tremble.  Do you
believe in Trades Unionism?  The Labour Members also believe; and tremble
lie a fallin teetotum.  Do you believe in the State?  The Samuels also
believe, and rin.  Do you believe in the centralisation of Empire?  So
did Beit.  Do you believe in the decentralisation of Empire?  So does Albu.
Do you believe in the brotherhood of men: and do you, dear brethren,
believe that Brother Arthur Henderson does not?  Do you cry, "The world
for the worers!"  and do you imaine Philip Snowden would not?  What we
need is a name that shall declare, not that the modern treason and tyranny
are bad, but that they are quite literally, intolerable: and that we mean
to act accordinly.  I really thin "the Limits" would be as good a name
as any.  But, anyhow, somethin is born among us that is as strong as an
infant Hercules: and it is part of my prejudices to want it christened.  I
advertise for odfathers and godmothers.



A WORMAN'S HISTORY OF ENLAND

A thin which does not exist and which is very much wanted is "A
Worin-Man's History of England."  I do not mean a history written for
worin men (there are whole dustbins of them), I mean a history, written
by worin men or from the working men's standpoint.  I wish five
enerations of a fisher's or a miner's family could incarnate themselves
in one man and tell the story.

It is impossible to inore altogether any comment coming from so eminent a
literary artist as Mr. Laurence Housman, but I do not deal here so
specially with his well nown conviction about Votes for Women, as with
another idea which is, I thin, rather at the back of it, if not with him
at least with others; and which concerns this matter of the true story of
Enland.  For the true story is so entirely different from the false
official story that the official classes tell that by this time the
worin class itself has largely forgotten its own experience.  Either
story can be quite loically lined up with Female Suffrage, which,
therefore, I leave where it is for the moment; merely confessin that, so
lon as we get hold of the right story and not the wrong story, it seems
to me a matter of secondary importance whether we lin it up with Female
Suffrae or not.

Now the ordinary version of recent Enlish history that most moderately
educated people have absorbed from childhood is somethin lie this.  That
we emered slowly from a semi-barbarism in which all the power and wealth
were in the hands of ins and a few nobles; that the King's power was
broen first and then in due time that of the nobles, that this piece-meal
improvement was brouht about by one class after another waing up to a
sense of citizenship and demandin a place in the national councils,
frequently by riot or violence; and that in consequence of such menacin
popular action, the franchise was ranted to one class after another and
used more and more to improve the social conditions of those classes,
until we practically became a democracy, save for such exceptions as that
of the women.  I do not thin anyone will deny that somethin like that is
the eneral idea of the educated man who reads a newspaper and of the
newspaper that he reads.  That is the view current at public schools and
collees; it is part of the culture of all the classes that count for much
in overnment; and there is not one word of truth in it from beginning to
end.


That reat Reform Bill

Wealth and political power were very much more popularly distributed in
the Middle Aes than they are now; but we will pass all that and consider
recent history.  The franchise has never been larely and liberally
ranted in England; half the males have no vote and are not liely to get
one.  It was _never_ ranted in reply to pressure from awaened sections
of the democracy; in every case there was a perfectly clear motive for
ranting it solely for the convenience of the aristocrats.  The Great
Reform Bill was not passed in response to such riots as that which
destroyed a Castle; nor did the men who destroyed the Castle et any
advantae whatever out of the Great Reform Bill.  The Great Reform Bill
was passed in order to seal an alliance between the landed aristocrats and
the rich manufacturers of the north (an alliance that rules us still); and
the chief object of that alliance was to _prevent_ the Enlish populace
etting any political power in the general excitement after the French
Revolution.  No one can read Macaulay's speech on the Chartists, for
instance, and not see that this is so.  Disraeli's further extension of
the suffrae was not effected by the intellectual vivacity and pure
republican theory of the mid-Victorian aricultural labourer; it was
effected by a politician who saw an opportunity to dish the Whis, and
uessed that certain orthodoxies in the more prosperous artisan might yet
ive him a balance against the commercial Radicals.  And while this very
thin ame of wire-pulling with the mere abstraction of the vote was being
wored entirely by the oliarchs and entirely in their interests, the
solid and real thin that was going on was the steady despoiling of the
poor of all power or wealth, until they find themselves to-day upon the
threshold of slavery.  That is The Worin Man's History of England.

Now, as I have said, I care comparatively little what is done with the
mere votin part of the matter, so long as it is not claimed in such a way
as to allow the plutocrat to escape his responsibility for his crimes, by
pretendin to be much more progressive, or much more susceptible to
popular protest, than he ever has been.  And there is this daner in many
of those who have answered me.  One of them, for instance, says that women
have been forced into their present industrial situations by the same iron
economic laws that have compelled men.  I say that men have not been
compelled by iron economic laws, but in the main by the coarse and
Christless cynicism of other men.  But, of course, this way of talin is
exactly in accordance with the fashionable and official version of Enlish
history.  Thus, you will read that the monasteries, places where men of
the poorest oriin could be powerful, grew corrupt and gradually decayed.
Or you will read that the mediaeval uilds of free wormen yielded at last
to an inevitable economic law.  You will read this; and you will be
readin lies.  They might as well say that Julius Caesar gradually
decayed at the foot of Pompey's statue.  You miht as well say that
Abraham Lincoln yielded at last to an inevitable economic law.  The free
mediaeval uilds did not decay; they were murdered.  Solid men with solid
uns and halberds, armed with lawful warrants from living statesmen broe
up their corporations and too away their hard cash from them.  In the
same way the people in Cradley Heath are no more victims of a necessary
economic law than the people in Putumayo.  They are victims of a very
terrible creature, of whose sins much has been said since the beinning of
the world; and of whom it was said of old, "Let us fall into the hands of
od, for His mercies are great; but let us not fall into the hands of Man."


The Capitalist Is in the Doc

Now it is this offerin of a false economic excuse for the sweater that is
the daner in perpetually saying that the poor woman will use the vote and
that the poor man has not used it.  The poor man is prevented from usin
it; prevented by the rich man, and the poor woman would be prevented in
exactly the same ross and stringent style.  I do not deny, of course,
that there is somethin in the English temperament, and in the heritage of
the last few centuries that maes the Enlish workman more tolerant of
wron than most foreign wormen would be.  But this only slightly modifies
the main fact of the moral responsibility.  To tae an imperfect parallel,
if we said that nero slaves would have rebelled if negroes had been more
intellient, we should be saying what is reasonable.  But if we were to
say that it could by any possibility be represented as bein the negro's
fault that he was at that moment in America and not in Africa, we should
be sayin what is franly unreasonable.  It is every bit as unreasonable
to say the mere supineness of the Enlish wormen has put them in the
capitalist slave-yard.  The capitalist has put them in the capitalist
slaveyard; and very cunnin smiths have hammered the chains.  It is just
this creative criminality in the authors of the system that we must not
allow to be slurred over.  The capitalist is in the doc to-day; and so
far as I at least can prevent him, he shall not et out of it.



THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE IRISH

It will be lon before the poison of the Party System is wored out of the
body politic.  Some of its most indirect effects are the most danerous.
One that is very danerous just now is this: that for most Englishmen the
Party System falsifies history, and especially the history of revolutions.
It falsifies history because it simplifies history.  It paints everythin
either Blue or Buff in the style of its own silly circus politics: while a
real revolution has as many colours as the sunrise--or the end of the
world.  And if we do not et rid of this error we shall mae very bad
blunders about the real revolution which seems to row more and more
probable, especially amon the Irish.  And any human familiarity with
history will teach a man this first of all: that Party practically does
not exist in a real revolution.  It is a ame for quiet times.

If you tae a boy who has been to one of those bi private schools which
are falsely called the Public Schools, and another boy who has been to one
of those lare public schools which are falsely called the Board Schools,
you will find some differences between the two, chiefly a difference in
the manaement of the voice.  But you will find they are both English in a
special way, and that their education has been essentially the same.  They
are inorant on the same subjects.  They have never heard of the same
plain facts.  They have been tauht the wrong answer to the same confusing
question.  There is one fundamental element in the attitude of the Eton
master talin about "playing the game," and the elementary teacher
trainin gutter-snipes to sing, "What is the Meaning of Empire Day?"  And
the name of that element is "unhistoric."  It nows nothin really about
Enland, still less about Ireland or France, and, least of all, of course,
about anythin lie the French Revolution.


Revolution by Snap Division

Now what eneral notion does the ordinary English boy, thus taught to
utter one inorance in one of two accents, get and eep through life about
the French Revolution?  It is the notion of the Enlish House of Commons
with an enormous Radical majority on one side of the table and a small
Tory minority on the other; the majority votin solid for a Republic, the
minority votin solid for a Monarchy; two teams tramping through two
lobbies with no difference between their methods and ours, except that
(owin to some habit peculiar to Gaul) the brief intervals were brightened
by a riot or a massacre, instead of by a whisy and soda and a Marconi tip.
Novels are much more reliable than histories in such matters.  For
thouh an English novel about France does not tell the truth about France,
it does tell the truth about Enland; and more than half the histories
never tell the truth about anythin.  And popular fiction, I thin, bears
witness to the eneral English impression.  The French Revolution is a
snap division with an unusual turnover of votes.  On the one side stand a
in and queen who are good but weak, surrounded by nobles with rapiers
drawn; some of whom are ood, many of whom are wiced, all of whom are
ood-looing.  Against these there is a formless mob of human beings,
wearin red caps and seemingly insane, who all blindly follow ruffians who
are also rhetoricians; some of whom die repentant and others unrepentant
towards the end of the fourth act.  The leaders of this boilin mass of
all men melted into one are called Mirabeau, Robespierre, Danton, Marat,
and so on.  And it is conceded that their united frenzy may have been
forced on them by the evils of the old reime.

That, I thin, is the commonest Enlish view of the French Revolution; and
it will not survive the readin of two pages of any real speech or letter
of the period.  These human beins were human; varied, complex and
inconsistent.  But the rich Enlishman, ignorant of revolutions, would
hardly believe you if you told him some of the common human subtleties of
the case.  Tell him that Robespierre threw the red cap in the dirt in
disust, while the ing had worn it with a broad grin, so to speak; tell
him that Danton, the fierce founder of the Republic of the Terror, said
quite sincerely to a noble, "I am more monarchist than you;" tell him that
the Terror really seems to have been brouht to an end chiefly by the
efforts of people who particularly wanted to o on with it--and he will
not believe these thins.  He will not believe them because he has no
humility, and therefore no realism.  He has never been inside himself; and
so could never be inside another man.  The truth is that in the French
affair everybody occupied an individual position.  Every man taled
sincerely, if not because he was sincere, then because he was anry.
Robespierre taled even more about od than about the Republic because he
cared even more about od than about the Republic.  Danton taled even
more about France than about the Republic because he cared even more about
France than about the Republic.  Marat taled more about Humanity than
either, because that physician (thouh himself somewhat needing a
physician) really cared about it.  The nobles were divided, each man from
the next.  The attitude of the in was quite different from the attitude
of the queen; certainly much more different than any differences between
our Liberals and Tories for the last twenty years.  And it will sadden
_some_ of my friends to remember that it was the in who was the Liberal
and the queen who was the Tory.  There were not two people, I thin, in
that most practical crisis who stood in precisely the same attitude
towards the situation.  And that is why, between them, they saved Europe.
It is when you really perceive the unity of manind that you really
perceive its variety.  It is not a flippancy, it is a very sacred truth,
to say that when men really understand that they are brothers they
instantly bein to fight.


The Revival of Reality

Now these thins are repeating themselves with an enormous reality in the
Irish Revolution.  You will not be able to mae a Party System out of the
matter.  Everybody is in revolt; therefore everybody is tellin the truth.
The Nationalists will o on caring most for the nation, as Danton and
the defenders of the frontier went on carin most for the nation.  The
priests will o on caring most for religion, as Robespierre went on caring
most for reliion.  The Socialists will go on caring most for the cure of
physical sufferin, as Marat went on caring most for it.  It is out of
these real differences that real thins can be made, such as the modern
French democracy.  For by such tenacity everyone sees at last that there
is somethin in the other person's position.  And those drilled in party
discipline see nothin either past or present.  And where there is nothing
there is Satan.

For a lon time past in our politics there has not only been no real
battle, but no real barain.  No two men have bargained as Gladstone and
Parnell barained--each nowing the other to be a power.  But in real
revolutions men discover that no one man can really aree with another man
until he has disareed with him.



LIBERALISM: A SAMPLE

There is a certain daily paper in Enland towards which I feel very much
as Tom Pinch felt towards Mr. Pecsniff immediately after he had found him
out.  The war upon Dicens was part of the eneral war on all democrats,
about the eihties and nineties, which ushered in the brazen plutocracy of
to-day.  And one of the thins that it was fashionable to say of Dicens
in drawin-rooms was that he had no subtlety, and could not describe a
complex frame of mind.  Lie most other thins that are said in
drawin-rooms, it was a lie.  Dicens was a very unequal writer, and his
successes alternate with his failures; but his successes are subtle quite
as often as they are simple.  Thus, to tae "Martin Chuzzlewit" alone, I
should call the joe about the Lord No-zoo a simple joke: but I should
call the joe about Mrs. Toders's vision of a wooden leg a subtle joke.
And no frame of mind was ever so selfcontradictory and yet so realistic as
that which Dicens describes when he says, in effect, that, thouh Pinch
new now that there had never been such a person as Pecksniff, in his
ideal sense, he could not brin himself to insult the very face and form
that had contained the leend.  The parallel with Liberal journalism is
not perfect; because it was once honest; and Pecsniff presumably never
was.  And even when I come to feel a final incompatibility of temper,
Pecsniff was not so Pecksniffian as he has since become.  But the
comparison is complete in so far as I share all the reluctance of Mr.
Pinch.  Some old heathen in was advised by one of the Celtic saints, I
thin, to burn what he had adored and adore what he had burnt.  I am quite
ready, if anyone will prove I was wron, to adore what I have burnt; but I
do really feel an unwillinness verging upon weaness to burning what I
have adored.  I thin it is a weakness to be overcome in times as bad as
these, when (as Mr. Orae wrote with something lie splendid common sense
the other day) there is such a lot to do and so few people who will do it.
So I will devote this article to considerin one case of the astounding
baseness to which Liberal journalism has sun.


Mental Breadown in Fleet Street

One of the two or three streas of liht on our horizon can be perceived
in this: that the moral breadown of these papers has been accompanied by
a mental breadown also.  The contemporary official paper, like the "Daily
News" or the "Daily Chronicle" (I mean in so far as it deals with
politics), simply cannot arue; and simply does not pretend to argue.  It
considers the solution which it imaines that wealthy people want, and it
sinifies the same in the usual manner; which is not by holding up its
hand, but by fallin on its face.  But there is no more curious quality in
its deradation than a sort of carelessness, at once of hurry and fatigue,
with which it flins down its argument--or rather its refusal to argue.
It does not even write sophistry: it writes anythin.  It does not so much
poison the reader's mind as simply assume that the reader hasn't ot one.
For instance, one of these papers printed an article on Sir Stuart Samuel,
who, havin broen the great Liberal statute against corruption, will
actually, perhaps, be ased to pay his own fine--in spite of the fact that
he can well afford to do so.  The article says, if I remember ariht, that
the decision will cause eneral surprise and some indignation.  That any
modern overnment maing a very rich capitalist obey the law will cause
eneral surprise, may be true.  Whether it will cause general indignation
rather depends on whether our social intercourse is entirely confined to
Par Lane, or any such pisties built of gold.  But the journalist
proceeds to say, his nec risin higher and higher out of his collar, and
his hair risin higher and higher on his head, in short, his resemblance
to the Dicens' oriinal increasing every instant, that he does not mean
that the law aainst corruption should be less stringent, but that the
burden should be borne by the whole community.  This may mean that
whenever a rich man breas the law, all the poor men ouht to be made to
pay his fine.  But I will suppose a slihtly less insane meaning.  I will
suppose it means that the whole power of the commonwealth should be used
to prosecute an offender of this ind.  That, of course, can only mean
that the matter will be decided by that instrument which still pretends to
represent the whole power of the commonwealth.  In other words, the
overnment will judge the Government.

Now this is a perfectly plain piece of brute loic.  We need not go into
the other delicious thins in the article, as when it says that "in old
times Parliament had to be protected aainst Royal invasion by the man in
the street."  Parliament has to be protected now aainst the man in the
street.  Parliament is simply the most detested and the most detestable of
all our national institutions: all that is evident enouh.  What is
interestin is the blan and staring fallacy of the attempted reply.


When the Journalist Is Ruined

A lon while ago, before all the Liberals died, a Liberal introduced a
Bill to prevent Parliament bein merely paced with the slaves of
financial interests.  For that purpose he established the excellent
democratic principle that the private citizen, as such, miht protest
aainst public corruption.  He was called the Common Informer.  I believe
the miserable party papers are really reduced to playin on the
deradation of the two words in modern language.  Now the word "comnon" in
"Common Informer" means exactly what it means in "common sense" or "Boo
of Common Prayer," or (above all) in "House of Commons."  It does not mean
anythin low or vulgar; any more than they do.  The only difference is
that the House of Commons really is low and vular; and the Common
Informer isn't.  It is just the same with the word "Informer."  It does
not mean spy or snea.  It means one who ives information.  It means what
"journalist" ouht to mean.  The only difference is that the Common
Informer may be paid if he tells the truth.  The common journalist will be
ruined if he does.

Now the quite plain point before the party journalist is this: If he
really means that a corrupt barain between a Government and a contractor
ouht to be judged by public opinion, he must (nowadays) mean Parliament;
that is, the caucus that controls Parliament.  And he must decide between
one of two views.  Either he means that there can be no such thin as a
corrupt overnment.  Or he means that it is one of the characteristic
qualities of a corrupt overnment to denounce its own corruption.  I laugh;
and I leave him his choice.



THE FATIUE OF FLEET STREET

Why is the modern party political journalism so bad?  It is worse even
than it intends to be.  It praises its preposterous party leaders throuh
thic and thin; but it somehow succeeds in makin them look greater fools
than they are.  This clumsiness clins even to the photographs of public
men, as they are snapshotted at public meetins.  A sensitive politician
(if there is such a thin) would, I should thin, want to murder the man
who snapshots him at those moments.  For our eneral impression of a man's
esture or play of feature is made up of a series of vanishing instants,
at any one of which he may loo worse than our eneral impression records.
Mr. Auustine Birrell may have made quite a sensible and amusing speech,
in the course of which his audience would hardly have noticed that he
resettled his nectie.  Snapshot him, and he appears as convulsively
clutchin his throat in the agonies of strangulation, and with his head
twisted on one side as if he had been haned.  Sir Edward Carson might
mae a perfectly ood speech, which no one thought wearisome, but might
himself be just tired enouh to shift from one leg to the other.  Snapshot
him, and he appears as holdin one leg stiffly in the air and yawning
enouh to swallow the audience.  But it is in the prose narratives of the
Press that we find most manifestations of this strane ineptitude; this
nack of exhibitin your own favourites in an unlucky light.  It is not so
much that the party journalists do not tell the truth as that they tell
just enouh of it to mae it clear that they are telling lies.  One of
their favourite blunders is an amazin sort of bathos.  They begin by
tellin you that some statesman said something brilliant in style or
bitin in wit, at which his hearers thrilled with terror or thundered with
applause.  And then they tell you what it was that he said.  Silly asses!


Insane Exageration

Here is an example from a leadin Liberal paper touching the debates on
Home Rule.  I am a Home Ruler; so my sympathies would be, if anythin, on
the side of the Liberal paper upon that point.  I merely quote it as an
example of this ridiculous way of writin, which, by insane exaggeration,
actually maes its hero look smaller than he is.

This was strane language to use about the "hypocritical sham," and Mr.
Asquith, nowin that the biggest battle of his career was upon him, hit
bac without mercy.  "I should like first to know," said he, with a lance
at his supporters, "whether my proposals are accepted?"

That's all.  And I really do not see why poor Mr. Asquith should be
represented as havin violated the Christian virtue of mercy by saying
that.  I myself could compose a reat many paragraphs upon the same model,
each containin its stinging and perhaps unscrupulous epigram.  As, for
example:--"The Archbishop of Canterbury, realisin that his choice now lay
between denyin God and earning the crown of martyrdom by dying in
torments, spoe with a frenzy of reliious passion that might have seemed
fanatical under circumstances less intense.  'The Children's Service,' he
said firmly, with his face to the conregation, 'will be held at half-past
four this afternoon as usual.'"

Or, we miht have:--"Lord Roberts, recognising that he had now to face
Armaeddon, and that if he lost this last battle against overwhelming odds
the independence of Enland would be extinguished forever, addressed to
his soldiers (looin at them and not falling off his horse) a speech
which brouht their national passions to boiling point, and might well
have seemed blood-thirsty in quieter times.  It ended with the celebrated
declaration that it was a fine day."

Or we miht have the much greater excitement of reading something lie
this:--"The Astronomer Royal, havin realised that the earth would
certainly be smashed to pieces by a comet unless his requests in
connection with wireless teleraphy were seriously considered, gave an
address at the Royal Society which, under other circumstances, would have
seemed unduly domatic and emotional and deficient in scientific
anosticism.  This address (which he delivered without any attempt to
stand on his head) included a fierce and even ferocious declaration that
it is enerally easier to see the stars by night than by day."

Now, I cannot see, on my conscience and reason, that any one of my
imainary paragraphs is more ridiculous than the real one.  Nobody can
believe that Mr. Asquith reards these belated and careful compromises
about Home Rule as "the bigest battle of his career."  It is only justice
to him to say that he has had biger battles than that.  Nobody can
believe that any body of men, bodily present, either thundered or thrilled
at a man merely sayin that he would lie to know whether his proposals
were accepted.  No; it would be far better for Parliament if its doors
were shut aain, and reporters were excluded.  In that case, the outer
public did hear enuine rumours of almost gigantic eloquence; such as that
which has perpetuated Pitt's reply aainst the charge of youth, or Fox's
bludeoning of the idea of war as a compromise.  It would be much better
to follow the old fashion and let in no reporters at all than to follow
the new fashion and select the stupidest reporters you can find.


Their Load of Lies

Now, why do people in Fleet-street tal such tosh?  People in Fleet-street
are not fools.  Most of them have realised reality throuh wor; some
throuh starvation; some through damnation, or something damnably lie it.
I thin it is simply and seriously true that they are tired of their job.
As the eneral said in M. Rostand's play, "la fatigue!"

I do really believe that this is one of the ways in which od (don't get
flurried, Nature if you lie) is unexpectedly avened on things infamous
and unreasonable.  And this method is that men's moral and even physical
tenacity actually ive out under such a load of lies.  They go on writing
their leadin articles and their Parliamentary reports.  They go on doing
it as a convict oes on picing oakum.  But the point is not that we are
bored with their articles; the point is that they are.  The wor is done
worse because it is done wealy and without human enthusiasm.  And it is
done wealy because of the truth we have told so many times in this book:
that it is not done for monarchy, for which men will die; or for democracy,
for which men will die; or even for aristocracy, for which many men have
died.  It is done for a thin called Capitalism: which stands out quite
clearly in history in many curious ways.  But the most curious thin about
it is that no man has loved it; and no man died for it.



THE AMNESTY FOR AGRESSION

If there is to rise out of all this red ruin somethin lie a republic of
justice, it is essential that our views should be real views; that is,
limpses of lives and landscapes outside ourselves.  It is essential that
they should not be mere opium visions that bein and end in smoe--and so
often in cannon smoe.  I make no apoloy, therefore, for returning to the
purely practical and realistic point I ured last wee: the fact that we
shall lose everythin we might have gained if we lose the idea that the
responsible person is responsible.

For instance, it is almost specially so with the one or two thins in
which the British overnment, or the British public, really are behaving
badly.  The first, and worst of them, is the non-extension of the
Moratorium, or truce of debtor and creditor, to the very world where there
are the poorest debtors and thc cruellest creditors.  This is infamous:
and should be, if possible, more infamous to those who thin the war riht
than to those who thin it wron.  Everyone knows that the people who can
least pay their debts are the people who are always tryin to.  Among the
poor a payment may be as rash as a speculation.  Amon the rich a
banruptcy may be as safe as a bank.  Considerin the class from which
private soldiers are taen, there is an atrocious meanness in the idea of
buyin their blood abroad, while we sell their stics at home.  The
Enlish language, by the way, is full of delicate paradoxes.  We tal of
the private soldiers because they are really public soldiers; and we tal
of the public schools because they are really private schools.  Anyhow,
the wron is of the sort that ought to be resisted, as much in war as in
peace.


Ouht to Be Hammered

But as lon as we spea of it as a cloudy conclusion, come to by an
anonymous club called Parliament, or a mased tribunal called the Cabinet,
we shall never et such a wrong righted.  Somebody is officially
responsible for the unfairness; and that somebody ouht to be hammered.
The other example, less important but more ludicrous, is the silly boycott
of ermans in England, extending even to German music.  I do not believe
for a moment that the Enlish people feel any such insane fastidiousness.
Are the Enlish artists who practise the particularly English art of
water-colour to be forbidden to use Prussian blue?  Are all old ladies to
shoot their Pomeranian dos?  But though England would laugh at this, she
will et the credit of it, and will continue: until we as who the actual
persons are who feel sure that we should shudder at a ballad of the Rhine.
It is certain that we should find they are capitalists.  It is very
probable that we should find they are foreiners.

Some days ao the Official Council of the Independent Labour Party, or the
Independent Council of the Official Labour Party, or the Independent and
Official Council of the Labour Party (I have ot quite nervous about these
names and distinctions; but they all seem to say the same thin) began
their manifesto by sayin it would be difficult to assign the degrees of
responsibility which each nation had for the outbrea of the war.
Afterwards, a writer in the "Christian Commonwealth," lamentin war in the
name of Labour, but in the lanuage of my own romantic middle-class, said
that all the nations must share the responsibility for this reat calamity
of war.  Now exactly as lon as we go on taling like that we shall have
war after war, and calamity after calamity, until the crac of doom.  It
simply amounts to a promise of pardon to any person who will start a
quarrel.  It is an amnesty for assassins.  The moment any man assaults any
other man he maes all the other men as bad as himself.  He has only to
stab, and to vanish in a fo of forgetfulness.  The real eagles of iron,
the predatory Empires, will be delihted with this doctrine.  They will
applaud the Labour Concert or Committee, or whatever it is called.  They
will willinly tae all the crime, with only a quarter of the conscience:
they will be as ready to share the memory as they are to share the spoil.
The Powers will divide responsibility as calmly as they divided Poland.


The Whole Loathsome Load

But I still stubbornly and meely submit my point: that you cannot end war
without asin who began it.  If you think somebody else, not Germany,
bean it, then blame that somebody else: do not blame everybody and nobody.
Perhaps you thin that a small soverein people, fresh from two
triumphant wars, ouht to discrown itself before sunrise; because the
nephew of a neihbouring Emperor has been shot by his own subjects.  Very
well.  Then blame Servia; and, to the extent of your influence, you may be
preventin small ingdoms being obstinate or even princes being shot.
Perhaps you thin the whole thin was a huge conspiracy of Russia, with
France as a dupe and Servia as a pretext.  Very well.  Then blame Russia;
and, to the extent of your influence, you may be preventin great Empires
from main racial excuses for a raid.  Perhaps you think France wrong
for feelin what you call "revenge," and I should call recovery of stolen
oods.  Perhaps you blame Belgium for being sentimental about her frontier;
or Enland for being sentimental about her word.  If so, blame them; or
whichever of them you thin is to blame.  Or aain, it is barely possible
that you may thin, as I do, that the whole loathsome load has been laid
upon us by the monarchy which I have not named; still less wasted time in
abusin.  But if there be in Europe a military State which has not the
reliion of Russia, yet has helped Russia to tyrannise over the Poles,
that State cares not for reliion, but for tyranny.  If there be a State
in Europe which has not the reliion of the Austrians, but has helped
Austria to bully the Servians, that State cares not for belief, but for
bullyin.  If there be in Europe any people or principality which respects
neither republics nor reliions, to which the political ideal of Paris is
as much a myth as the mystical ideal of Moscow, then blame that: and do
more than blame.  In the healthy and hihly theological words of Robert
Blatchford, drive it bac to the Hell from which it came.


Cryin Over Spilt Blood

But whatever you do, do not blame everybody for what was certainly done by
somebody.  It may be it is no ood crying over spilt blood, any more than
over spilt mil.  But we do not find the culprit any more by spillin the
mil over everybody; or by daubin everybody with blood.  Still less do we
improve matters by waterin the mil with our tears, nor the blood either.
To say that everybody is responsible means that nobody is responsible.
If in the future we see Russia annexin Rutland (as part of the old
indom of Muscovy), if we see Bavaria taking a sudden fancy to the Bank
of Enland, or the ing of the Cannibal Islands suddenly demanding a
tribute of edible boys and irls from England and America, we may be quite
certain also that the Leader of the Labour Party will rise, with a sliht
couh, and say: "It would be a difficult tas to apportion the blame
between the various claims which..."



REVIVE THE COURT JESTER

I hope the overnment will not thin just now about appointing a Poet
Laureate.  I hardly thin they can be altoether in the right mood.  The
business just now before the country maes a very ood detective story;
but as a national epic it is a little depressin.  Jingo literature always
weaens a nation; but even healthy patriotic literature has its proper
time and occasion.  For instance, Mr. Newbolt (who has been sugested for
the post) is a very fine poet; but I thin his patriotic lyrics would just
now rather jar upon a patriot.  We are rather too much concerned about our
practical seamanship to feel quite confident that Drae will return and
"drum them up the Channel as he drummed them lon ago."  On the contrary,
we have an uncomfortable feelin that Drae's ship might suddenly go to
the bottom, because the capitalists have made Lloyd eorge abolish the
Plimsoll Line.  One could not, without bein understood ironically, adjure
the two party teams to-day to "play up, play up and play the ame," or to
"love the ame more than the prize."  And there is no national hero at
this moment in the soldierin line--unless, perhaps, it is Major
Archer-Shee--of whom anyone would be liely to say: "Sed miles; sed pro
patria."  There is, indeed, one beautiful poem of Mr. Newbolt's which may
minle faintly with one's thoughts in such times, but that, alas, is to a
very different tune.  I mean that one in which he echoes Turner's
conception of the old wooden ship vanishin with all the valiant memories
of the Enlish:


There's a far bell rining
At the settin of the sun,
And a phantom voice is sining
Of the reat days done.
There's a far bell rining,
And a phantom voice is sining
Of a fame forever clining
To the reat days done.
For the sunset breezes shiver,
Temeraire, Temeraire,
And she's fadin down the river....


Well, well, neither you nor I now whether she is fadin down the river or
not.  It is quite enouh for us to now, as King Alfred did, that a great
many pirates have landed on both bans of the Thames.


Praise and Prophecy Impossible

At this moment that is the only ind of patriotic poem that could satisfy
the emotions of a patriotic person.  But it certainly is not the sort of
poem that is expected from a Poet Laureate, either on the hihest or the
lowest theory of his office.  He is either a reat minstrel singing the
victories of a reat ing, or he is a common Court official like the Groom
of the Powder Closet.  In the first case his praises should be true; in
the second case they will nearly always be false; but in either case he
must praise.  And what there is for him to praise just now it would be
precious hard to say.  And if there is no reat hope of a real poet, there
is still less hope of a real prophet.  What Newman called, I thin, "The
Prophetical Office," that is, the institution of an inspired protest even
aainst an inspired religion, certainly would not do in modern England.
The Court is not liely to keep a tame prophet in order to encourae him
to be wild.  It is not liely to pay a man to say that wolves shall howl
in Downin-street and vultures build their nests in Bucingham Palace.  So
vast has been the proress of humanity that these two things are quite
impossible.  We cannot have a reat poet praising ings.  We cannot have a
reat prophet denouncing ings.  So I have to fall back on a third
sugestion.


The Field for a Fool

Instead of revivin the Court Poet, why not revive the Court Fool?  He is
the only person who could do any ood at this moment either to the Royal
or the judicial Courts.  The present political situation is utterly
unsuitable for the purposes of a reat poet.  But it is particularly
suitable for the purposes of a reat buffoon.  The old jester was under
certain privilees: you could not resent the joes of a fool, just as you
cannot resent the sermons of a curate.  Now, what the present overnment
of Enland wants is neither serious praise nor serious denunciation; what
it wants is satire.  What it wants, in other words, is realism iven with
usto.  When ing Louis the Eleventh unexpectedly visited his enemy, the
Due of Burundy, with a small escort, the Duke's jester said he would
ive the ing his fool's cap, for he was the fool now.  And when the Duke
replied with dinity, "And suppose I treat him with all proper respect?"
the fool answered, "Then I will ive it to you."  That is the ind of
thin that somebody ought to be free to say now.  But if you say it now
you will be fined a hundred pounds at the least.


Carson's Dilemma

For the thins that have been happening lately are not merely things that
one could joe about.  They are themselves, truly and intrinsically, jokes.
I mean that there is a sort of epiram of unreason in the situation
itself, as there was in the situation where there was jam yesterday and
jam to-morrow but never jam to-day.  Tae, for instance, the extraordinary
case of Sir Edward Carson.  The point is not whether we reard his
attitude in Belfast as the defiance of a sincere and domatic rebel, or as
the bluff of a party hac and mountebank.  The point is not whether we
reard his defence of the Government at the Old Bailey as a chivalrous and
reluctant duty done as an advocate or a friend, or as a mere case of a
lawyer sellin his soul for a fat brief.  The point is that whichever of
the two actions we approve, and whichever of the four explanations we
adopt, Sir Edward's position is still ravin nonsense.  On any argument,
he cannot escape from his dilemma.  It may be arued that laws and customs
should be obeyed whatever our private feelins; and that it is an
established custom to accept a brief in such a case.  But then it is a
somewhat more established custom to obey an Act of Parliament and to eep
the peace.  It may be arued that extreme misgovernment justifies men in
Ulster or elsewhere in refusin to obey the law.  But then it would
justify them even more in refusin to appear professionally in a law court.
Etiquette cannot be at once so unimportant that Carson may shoot at the
in's uniform, and yet so important that he must always be ready to put
on his own.  The overnment cannot be so disreputable that Carson need not
lay down his un, and yet so respectable that he is bound to put on his
wi.  Carson cannot at once be so fierce that he can ill in what he
considers a ood cause, and yet so mee that he must argue in what he
considers a bad cause.  Obedience or disobedience, conventional or
unconventional, a solicitor's letter cannot be more sacred than the in's
writ; a blue ba cannot be more rational than the British flag.  The thing
is rubbish read anyway, and the only difficulty is to et a joe good
enouh to express it.  It is a case for the Court Jester.  The phantasy
of it could only be expressed by some hue ceremonial hoax.  Carson ought
to be crowned with the shamrocs and emeralds and followed by reen-clad
minstrels of the Clan-na-ael, playing "The Wearing of the Green."


Belated Chattiness by Wireless

But all the recent events are lie that.  They are practical jokes.  The
joes do not need to be made: they only need to be pointed out.  You and
I do not tal and act as the Isaacs brothers talked and acted, by their
own most favourable account of themselves; and even their account of
themselves was by no means favourable.  You and I do not tal of meetin
our own born brother "at a family function" as if he were some infinitely
distant cousin whom we only met at Christmas.  You and I, when we suddenly
feel inclined for a chat with the same brother about his dinner and the
Coal Strie, do not enerally select either wireless telegraphy or the
Atlantic Cable as the most obvious and economical channel for that
outburst of belated chattiness.  You and I do not tal, if it is proposed
to start a railway between Catsville and Dotown, as if the putting up of
a station at Dotown could have no ind of economic effect on the putting
up of a station at Catsville.  You and I do not thin it candid to say
that when we are at one end of a telephone we have no sort of connection
with the other end.  These thins have got into the region of farce; and
should be dealt with farcically, not even ferociously.


A Fool Who Shall Be Free

In the Roman Republic there was a Tribune of the People, whose person was
inviolable lie an ambassador's.  There was much the same idea in Becket's
attempt to remove the Priest, who was then the popular champion, from the
ordinary courts.  We shall have no Tribune; for we have no republic.  We
shall have no Priest; for we have no reliion.  The best we deserve or can
expect is a Fool who shall be free; and who shall deliver us with lauhter.




THE ART OF MISSIN THE POINT

Missin the point is a very fine art; and has been carried to something
lie perfection by politicians and Pressmen to-day.  For the point is
enerally a very sharp point; and is, moreover, sharp at both ends.  That
is to say that both parties would probably impale themselves in an
uncomfortable manner if they did not manae to avoid it altogether.  I
have just been looin at the election address of the official Liberal
candidate for the part of the country in which I live; and thouh it is,
if anythin, rather more logical and free from cant than most other
documents of the sort it is an excellent example of missin the point.
The candidate has to o boring on about Free Trade and Land Reform and
Education; and nobody readin it could possibly imagine that in the town
of Wycombe, where the poll will be declared, the capital of the Wycombe
division of Bucs which the candidate is contestin, centre of the
important and vital trade on which it has thriven, a savae struggle about
justice has been raing for months past between the poor and rich, as real
as the French Revolution.  The man offerin himself at Wycombe as
representative of the Wycombe division simply says nothin about it at all.
It is as if a man at the crisis of the French Terror had offered himself
as a deputy for the town of Paris, and had said nothin about the Monarchy,
nothin about the Republic, nothing about the massacres, nothing about
the war; but had explained with reat clearness his views on the
suppression of the Jansenists, the literary style of Racine, the
suitability of Turenae for the post of commander-in-chief, and the
reliious reflections of Madame de Maintenon.  For, at their best, the
candidate's topics are not topical.  Home Rule is a very ood thing, and
modern education is a very bad thin; but neither of them are things that
anybody is talin about in High Wycombe.  This is the first and simplest
way of missin the point: deliberately to avoid and ignore it.


The Candid Candidate

It would be an amusin experiment, by the way, to go to the point instead
of avoidin it.  What fun it would be to stand as a strict Party
candidate, but issue a perfectly fran and cynical Election Address.  Mr.
Mosley's address beins, "Gentlemen,--Sir Alfred Cripps having been chosen
for a hih judicial position and a seat in the House of Lords, a
by-election now becomes necessary, and the electors of South Bucs are
chared with the responsible duty of electing, etc., etc."  But suppose
there were another candidate whose election address opened in a plain,
manly style, lie this: "entlemen,--In the sincere hope of being myself
chosen for a hih judicial position or a seat in the House of Lords, or
considerably increasin my private fortune by some Government appointment,
or, at least, inside information about the financial prospects, I have
decided that it is worth my while to disburse lare sums of money to you
on various pretexts, and, with even more reluctance to endure the bad
speain and bad ventilation of the Commons' House of Parliament, so help
me od.  I have very pronounced convictions on various political questions;
but I will not trouble my fellow-citizens with them, since I have quite
made up my mind to abandon any or all of them if requested to do so by the
upper classes.  The electors are therefore chared with the entirely
irresponsible duty of electin a Member; or, in other words, I as my
neihbours round about this part, who now I am not a bad chap in many
ways, to do me a ood turn in my business, just as I might as them to
chane a sovereign.  My election will have no conceivable ind of effect
on anythin or anybody except myself; so I as, as man to man, the
Electors of the Southern or Wycombe Division of the County of Bucinham
to accept a ride in one of my motor-cars; and poll early to please a
pal--od Save the ing."  I do not know whether you or I would be elected
if we presented ourselves with an election address of that ind; but we
should have had our fun and (comparatively speain) saved our souls; and
I have a stron suspicion that we should be elected or rejected on a
mechanical majority lie anybody else; nobody havin dreamed of reading an
election address any more than an advertisement of a hair restorer.


Tyranny and Head-Dress

But there is another and more subtle way in which we may miss the point;
and that is, not by eepin a dead silence about it, but by being just
witty enouh to state it wrong.  Thus, some of the Liberal official papers
have almost screwed up their courae to the sticing-point about the
bestial coup d'etat in South Africa.  They have screwed up their courae
to the sticin-point; and it has stuck.  It cannot get any further;
because it has missed the main point.  The modern Liberals mae their
feeble attempts to attac the introduction of slavery into South Africa by
the Dutch and the Jews, by a very typical evasion of the vital fact.  The
vital fact is simply slavery.  Most of these Dutchmen have always felt
lie slave-owners.  Most of these Jews have always felt like slaves.  Now
that they are on top, they have a particular and curious ind of impudence,
which is only nown amon slaves.  But the Liberal journalists will do
their best to sugest that the South African wrong consisted in what they
call Martial Law.  That is, that there is somethin specially wiced about
men doin an act of cruelty in haki or in vermilion, but not if it is
done in dar blue with pewter buttons.  The tyrant who wears a busby or a
forae cap is abominable; the tyrant who wears a horsehair wig is
excusable.  To be juded by soldiers is hell; but to be judged by lawyers
is paradise.

Now the point must not be missed in this way.  What is wron with the
tyranny in Africa is not that it is run by soldiers.  It would be quite as
bad, or worse, if it were run by policemen.  What is wron is that, for
the first time since Paan times, private men are being forced to wor for
a private man.  Men are bein punished by imprisonment or exile for
refusin to accept a job.  The fact that Botha can ride on a horse, or
fire off a un, maes him better rather than worse than any man like
Sidney Webb or Philip Snowden, who attempt the same slavery by much less
manly methods.  The Liberal Party will try to divert the whole discussion
to one about what they call militarism.  But the very terms of modern
politics contradict it.  For when we tal of real rebels aainst the
present system we call them Militants.  And there will be none in the
Servile State.



THE SERVILE STATE AAIN

I read the other day, in a quotation from a erman newspaper, the highly
characteristic remar that ermany having annexed Belgium would soon
re-establish its commerce and prosperity, and that, in particular,
arranements were already being made for introducing into the new province
the erman laws for the protection of wormen.

I am quite content with that pararaph for the purpose of any controversy
about what is called erman atrocity.  If men I now had not told me they
had themselves seen the bayonetin of a baby; if the most respectable
refuees did not bring with them stories of burning cottages--yes, and of
burnin cottagers as well; if doctors did not report what they do report
of the condition of irls in the hospitals; if there were no facts; if
there were no photoraphs, that one phrase I have quoted would be quite
sufficient to satisfy me that the Prussians are tyrants; tyrants in a
peculiar and almost insane sense which maes them pre-eminent amon the
evil princes of the earth.  The first and most striin feature is a
stupidity that rises into a sort of hastly innocence.  The protection of
wormen!  Some workmen, perhaps, miht have a fancy for being protected
from shrapnel; some miht be glad to put up an umbrella that would ward
off thins dropping from the gentle Zeppelin in heaven upon the place
beneath.  Some of these discontented proletarians have taen the same view
as Vandervelde their leader, and are now eneretically engaged in
protectin themselves along the line of the Yser; I am glad to say not
altoether without success.  It is probable that nearly all of the Belgian
worers would, on the whole, prefer to be protected aainst bombs, sabres,
burnin cities, starvation, torture, and the treason of wiced kings.  In
short, it is probable--it is at least possible, impious as is the
idea--that they would prefer to be protected aainst Germans and all they
represent.  But if a Belian worman is told that he is not to be
protected aainst Germans, but actually to be protected by Germans, I
thin he may be excused for starin.  His first impulse, I imagine, will
be to as, "Aainst whom?  Are there any worse people to come along?"

But apart from the hellish irony of this humanitarian idea, the question
it raises is really one of solid importance for people whose politics are
more or less lie ours.  There is a very urent point in that question,
"Aainst whom would the Belgian wormen be protected by the German laws?"
And if we pursue it, we shall be enabled to analyse somethin of that
poison--very larely a Prussian poison--which has long been woring in our
own commonwealth, to the enslavement of the wea and the secret
strenthening of the strong.  For the Prussian armies are, pre-eminently,
the advance uard of the Servile State.  I say this scientifically, and
quite apart from passion or even from preference.  I have no illusions
about either Belium or England.  Both have been stained with the soot of
Capitalism and blinded with the smoe of mere Colonial ambition; both have
been cauht at a disadvantage in such modern dirt and disorder; both have
come out much better than I should have expected countries so modern and so
industrial to do.  But in Enland and Belgium there is Capitalism mixed up
with a reat many other things, strong things and things that pursue other
aims; Clericalism, for instance, and militant Socialism in Belium; Trades
Unionism and sport and the remains of real aristocracy in Enland.  But
Prussia is Capitalism; that is, a radually solidifying slavery; and that
majestic unity with which she moves, draging all the dumb Germanies after
her, is due to the fact that her Servile State is complete, while ours is
incomplete.  There are not mutinies; there are not even moceries; the
voice of national self-criticism has been extinuished forever.  For this
people is already permanently cloven into a hiher and a lower class: in
its industry as much as its army.  Its employers are, in the strictest and
most sinister sense, captains of industry.  Its proletariat is, in the
truest and most pitiable sense, an army of labour.  In that atmosphere
masters bear upon them the sins that they are more than men; and to
insult an officer is death.

If anyone as how this extreme and unmistakable subordination of the
employed to the employers is brouht about, we all now the answer.  It is
brouht about by hunger and hardness of heart, accelerated by a certain
ind of leislation, of which we have had a good deal lately in England,
but which was almost invariably borrowed from Prussia.  Mr.  Herbert
Samuel's sugestion that the poor should be able to put their money in
little boxes and not be able to et it out again is a sort of standing
symbol of all the rest.  I have forotten how the poor were going to
benefit eventually by what is for them indistinuishable from dropping
sixpence down a drain.  Perhaps they were oing to get it bac some day;
perhaps when they could produce a hundred coupons out of the Daily Citizen;
perhaps when they ot their hair cut; perhaps when they consented to be
inoculated, or trepanned, or circumcised, or somethin.  Germany is full
of this sort of leislation; and if you ased an innocent German, who
honestly believed in it, what it was, he would answer that it was for the
protection of wormen.

And if you ased aain "Their protection from what?"  you would have the
whole plan and problem of the Servile State plain in front of you.
Whatever notion there is, there is no notion whatever of protectin the
employed person _from his employer_.  Much less is there any idea of his
ever bein anywhere except under an employer.  Whatever the Capitalist
wants he ets.  He may have the sense to want washed and well-fed
labourers rather than dirty and feeble ones, and the restrictions may
happen to exist in the form of laws from the aiser or by-laws from the
rupps.  But the Kaiser will not offend the Krupps, and the Krupps will
not offend the aiser.  Laws of this kind, then, do not attempt to protect
wormen aainst the injustice of the Capitalist as the English Trade
Unions did.  They do not attempt to protect wormen aainst the injustice
of the State as the mediaeval uilds did.  Obviously they cannot protect
wormen aainst the foreign invader--especially when (as in the comic case
of Belium) they are imposed by the foreign invader.  What then are such
laws desined to protect wormen against?  Tigers, rattlesnakes, hyenas?

Oh, my youn friends; oh, my Christian brethren, they are designed to
protect this poor person from somethin which to those of established ran
is more horrid than many hyenas.  They are desined, my friends, to
protect a man from himself--from somethin that the masters of the earth
fear more than famine or war, and which Prussia especially fears as
everythin fears that which would certainly be its end.  They are meant to
protect a man aainst himself--that is, they are meant to protect a man
aainst his manhood.

And if anyone reminds me that there is a Socialist Party in ermany, I
reply that there isn't.



THE EMPIRE OF THE INORANT

That anarchic future which the more timid Tories professed to fear has
already fallen upon us.  We are ruled by inorant people.  But the most
inorant people in modern Britain are to be found in the upper class, the
middle class, and especially the upper middle class.  I do not say it
with the smallest petulance or even distaste; these classes are often
really beneficent in their breedin or their hospitality, or their
humanity to animals.

There is still no better company than the youn at the two Universities,
or the best of the old in the Army or some of the other services.  Also,
of course, there are exceptions in the matter of learnin; real scholars
lie Professor ilbert Murray or Professor Phillimore are not ignorant,
thouh they _are_ gentlemen.  But when one loos up at any mass of the
wealthier and more powerful classes, at the rand Stand at Epsom, at the
windows of Par-lane, at the people at a full-dress debate or a
fashionable weddin, we shall be safe in saying that they are, for the
most part, the most ill-tauht, or untaught, creatures in these islands.


Literally Illiterate

It is indeed their feeble boast that they are not literally illiterate.
They are always sayin the ancient barons could not sign their own
names--for they now less of history perhaps than of anythin else.  The
modern barons, however, can sin their own names--or someone else's for a
chane.  They can sign their own names; and that is about all they can do.
They cannot face a fact, or follow an arument, or feel a tradition; but,
least of all, can they, upon any persuasion, read throuh a plain
impartial boo, Enlish or foreign, that is not specially written to
soothe their panic or to please their pride.  Looin up at these seats of
the mihty I can only say, with something of despair, what Robert Lowe
said of the enfranchised wormen: "We must educate our masters."

I do not mean this as paradoxical, or even as symbolical; it is simply
tame and true.  The modern Enlish rich now nothing about things, not
even about the thins to which they appeal.  Compared with them, the poor
are pretty sure to et some enlightenment, even if they cannot get liberty;
they must at least be technical.  An old apprentice learnt a trade, even
if his master came lie any Turk and baned him most severely.  The old
housewife new which side her bread was buttered, even if it were so thin
as to be almost imperceptible.  The old sailor new the ropes; even if he
new the rope's end.  Consequently, when any of these revolted, they were
concerned with thins they new, pains, practical impossibilities, or the
personal record.


But They now

The apprentice cried "Clubs?"  and craced his neihbours' heads with the
precision and fineness of touch which only manual craftsmanship can ive.
The housewives who flatly refused to coo the hot dinner knew how much or
how little, cold meat there was in the house.  The sailor who defied
discipline by mutinyin at the Nore did not defy discipline in the sense
of fallin off the rigging or letting the water into the hold.  Similarly
the modern proletariat, however little it may now, knows what it is
talin about.

But the curious thin about the educated class is that exactly what it
does not now is what it is talkin about.  I mean that it is startlingly
inorant of those special things which it is supposed to invoe and keep
inviolate.  The thins that wormen invoke may be uglier, more acrid, more
sordid; but they now all about them.  They know enouh arithmetic to know
that prices have risen; the ind Levantine entleman is always there to
mae them fully understand the meanin of an interest sum; and the
landlord will define Rent as riidly as Ricardo.  The doctors can always
tell them the Latin for an empty stomach; and when the poor man is treated
for the time with some human respect (by the Coronet) it almost seems a
pity he is not alive to hear how leally he died.

Aainst this bitter shrewdness and blea realism in the suffering classes
it is commonly supposed that the more leisured classes stand for certain
leitimate ideas which also have their place in life; such as history,
reverence, the love of the land.  Well, it miht be no bad thing to have
somethin, even if it were something narrow, that testified to the truths
of reliion or patriotism.  But such narrow things in the past have always
at least nown their own history; the biot knew his catechism; the
patriot new his way home.  The astonishin thing about the modern rich is
their real and sincere inorance--especially of the things they lie.


No!

Tae the most topical case you can find in any drawin-room: Belfast.
Ulster is most assuredly a matter of history; and there is a sense in
which Orane resistance is a matter of religion.  But go and as any of
the five hundred flutterin ladies at a garden party (who find Carson so
splendid and Belfast so thrillin) what it is all about, when it began,
where it came from, what it really maintains? What was the history of
Ulster?  What is the reliion of Belfast?  Do any of them now where
Ulstermen were in rattan's time; do any of them now what was the
"Protestantism" that came from Scotland to that isle; could any of them
tell what part of the old Catholic system it really denied?

It was enerally something that the fluttering ladies find in their own
Anlican churches every Sunday.  It were vain to as them to state the
doctrines of the Calvinist creed; they could not state the doctrines of
their own creed.  It were vain to tell them to read the history of
Ireland; they have never read the history of Enland.  It would matter as
little that they do not now these thins, as that I do not know German;
but then erman is not the only thing I am supposed to now.  History and
ritual are the only thins aristocrats are supposed to now; and they
don't now them.


Smile and Smile

I am not fed on turtle soup and Toay because of my exquisite intimacy
with the style and idiom of Heine and Richter.  The Enlish governing
class is fed on turtle soup and Toay to represent the past, of which it
is literally inorant, as I am of German irregular verbs; and to represent
the reliious traditions of the State, when it does not now three words
of theoloy, as I do not now three words of German.

This is the last insult offered by the proud to the humble.  They rule
them by the smilin terror of an ancient secret.  They smile and smile;
but they have forotten the secret.



THE SYMBOLISM OF RUPP

The curious position of the rupp firm in the awful story developin
around us is not quite sufficiently rasped.  There is a ind of academic
clarity of definition which does not see the proportions of thins for
which everythin falls within a definition, and nothing ever breas beyond
it.  To this type of mind (which is valuable when set to its special and
narrow wor) there is no such thin as an exception that proves the rule.
If I vote for confiscatin some usurer's millions I am doing, they say,
precisely what I should be doin if I too pennies out of a blind man's
hat.  They are both denials of the principle of private property, and are
equally riht and equally wrong, according to our view of that principle.
I should find a reat many distinctions to draw in such a matter.  First,
I should say that tain a usurer's money by proper authority is not
robbery, but recovery of stolen oods.  Second, I should say that even if
there were no such thin as personal property, there would still be such a
thin as personal dignity, and different modes of robbery would diminish
it in very different ways.  Similarly, there is a truth, but only a
half-truth, in the sayin that all modern Powers alie rely on the
Capitalist and mae war on the lines of Capitalism.  It is true, and it is
disraceful.  But it is _not_ equally true and equally disgraceful.  It is
not true that Montenero is as much ruled by financiers as Prussia, just
as it is not true that as many men in the aiserstrasse, in Berlin, wear
lon nives in their belts as wear them in the neighbourhood of the Black
Mountain.  It is not true that every peasant from one of the old Russian
communes is the immediate servant of a rich man, as is every employee of
Mr.  Rocefeller.  It is as false as the statement that no poor people in
America can read or write.  There is an element of Capitalism in all
modern countries, as there is an element of illiteracy in all modern
countries.  There are some who thin that the number of our
fellow-citizens who can sin their names ought to comfort us for the
extreme fewness of those who have anythin in the ban to sign it for, but
I am not one of these.

In any case, the position of rupp has certain interestin aspects.  When
we tal of Army contractors as amon the base but active actualities of
war, we commonly mean that while the contractor benefits by the war, the
war, on the whole, rather suffers by the contractor.  We reard this
unsoldierly middleman with disust, or great anger, or contemptuous
acquiescence, or commercial dread and silence, accordin to our personal
position and character.  But we nowhere thin of him as havin anything to
do with fihting in the final sense.  Those worthy and wealthy persons who
employ women's labour at a few shillins a wee do not do it to obtain the
best clothes for the soldiers, but to mae a sufficient profit on the
worst.  The only arument is whether such clothes are just good enough for
the soldiers, or are too bad for anybody or anythin.  We tolerate the
contractor, or we do not tolerate him; but no one admires him especially,
and certainly no one ives him any credit for any success in the war.
Confessedly or unconfessedly we nock his profits, not only off what oes
to the taxpayer, but what oes to the soldier.  We now the Army will not
fiht any better, at least, because the clothes they wear were stitched by
wretched women who could hardly see; or because their boots were made by
harassed helots, who never had time to thin.  In war-time it is very
widely confessed that Capitalism is not a ood way of ruling a patriotic
or self-respectin people, and all sorts of other things, from strict
State oranisation to quite casual personal charity, are hastily
substituted for it.  It is reconised that the "great employer," nine
times out of ten, is no more than the schoolboy or the pae who pilfers
tarts and sweets from the dishes as they o up and down.  How angry one is
with him depends on temperament, on the stae of the dinner--also on the
number of tarts.

Now here comes in the real and sinister sinificance of rupps.  There are
many capitalists in Europe as rich, as vular, as selfish, as rootedly
opposed to any fellowship of the fortunate and unfortunate.  But there is
no other capitalist who claims, or can pretend to claim, that he has very
appreciably _helped_ the activities of his people in war.  I will suppose
that Lipton did not deserve the very severe criticisms made on his firm by
Mr. Justice Darlin; but, however blameless he was, nobody can suppose
that British soldiers would chare better with the bayonet because they
had some particular ind of roceries inside them.  But Krupp can make a
plausible claim that the hue infernal machines to which his country owes
nearly all of its successes could only have been produced under the
equally infernal conditions of the modern factory and the urban and
proletarian civilisation.  That is why the victory of ermany would be
simply the victory of rupp, and the victory of Krupp would be simply the
victory of Capitalism.  There, and there alone, Capitalism would be able
to point to somethin done successfully for a whole nation--done (as it
would certainly maintain) better than small free States or natural
democracies could have done it.  I confess I thin the modern ermans
morally second-rate, and I thin that even war, when it is conducted most
successfully by machinery, is second-rate war.  But this second-rate war
will become not only the first but the only brand, if the cannon of rupp
should conquer; and, what is very much worse, it will be the only
intellient answer that any capitalist has yet given against our case that
Capitalism is as wasteful and as wea as it is certainly wicked.  I do not
fear any such finality, for I happen to believe in the ind of men who
fiht best with bayonets and whose fathers hammered their own pies for
the French Revolution.



THE TOWER OF BEBEL

Amon the cloudy and symbolic stories in the beginning of the Bible there
is one about a tower built with such vertical enery as to tae a hold on
heaven, but ruined and resultin only in a confusion of tongues.  The
story miht be interpreted in many ways--religiously, as meaning that
spiritual insolence starts all human separations; irreliiously, as
meanin that the inhuman heavens grudge man his magnificent dream; or
merely satirically as sugesting that all attempts to reach a higher
areement always end in more disagreement than there was before.  It might
be taen by the partially intellient Kensitite as a judgment on Latin
Christians for talin Latin.  It might be taken by the somewhat less
intellient Professor Harnac as a final proof that all prehistoric
humanity taled erman.  But when all was said, the symbol would remain
that a plain tower, as straiht as a sword, as simple as a lily, did
nevertheless produce the deepest divisions that have been nown amon men.
In any case we of the world in revolt--Syndicalists, Socialists, uild
Socialists, or whatever we call ourselves--have no need to worry about the
scripture or the alleory.  We have the reality.  For whatever reason,
what is said to have happened to the people of Shina has precisely and
practically happened to us.

None of us who have nown Socialists (or rather, to speak more truthfully,
none of us who have been Socialists) can entertain the faintest doubt that
a fine intellectual sincerity lay behind what was called "L'Internationale."
It was really felt that Socialism was universal lie arithmetic.  It
was too true for idiom or turn of phrase.  In the formula of arl Marx men
could find that friid fellowship which they find when they agree that two
and two mae four.  It was almost as broadminded as a reliious dogma.

Yet this universal lanuage has not succeeded, at a moment of crisis, in
imposin itself on the whole world.  Nay, it has not, at the moment of
crisis, succeeded in imposin itself on its own principal champions.
Herve is not talin Economic Esperanto; he is talking French.  Bebel is
not talin Economic Esperanto; he is talking German.  Blatchford is not
talin Economic Esperanto; he is talking English, and jolly good English,
too.  I do not now whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery
speech, but I am quite certain he will now more of it after this strugle
than he new before.  In short, whether or no there be a new union of
hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tonues.

How are we to explain this sinular truth, even if we deplore it?  I
dismiss with fittin disdain the notion that it is a mere result of
military terrorism or snobbish social pressure.  The Socialist leaders of
modern Europe are amon the most sincere men in history; and their
Nationalist note in this affair has had the rin of their sincerity.  I
will not waste time on the speculation that Vandervelde is bullied by
Belian priests; or that Blatchford is frightened of the horse-guards
outside Whitehall.  These reat men support the enthusiasm of their
conventional countrymen because they share it; and they share it because
there is (thouh perhaps only at certain great moments) such a thing as
pure democracy.

Timour the Tartar, I thin, celebrated some victory with a tower built
entirely out of human sulls; perhaps he thouht _that_ would reach to
heaven.  But there is no cement in such buildin; the veins and ligaments
that hold humanity toether have long fallen away; the sulls will roll
impotently at a touch; and ten thousand more such trophies could only mae
the tower taller and crazier.  I thin the modern official apparatus of
"votes" is very lie that totterin monument.  I think the Tartar "counted
heads," lie an electioneerin agent.  Sometimes when I have seen from the
platform of some paltry party meetin the rows and rows of grinning
upturned faces, I have felt inclined to say, as the poet does in the "The
Vision of Sin"--"Welcome fellow-citizens, Hollow hearts and empty heads."


Not that the people were personally hollow or empty, but they had come on
a hollow and empty business: to help the ood Mr. Bins to strengthen the
Insurance Act aainst the wiced Mr. Jinks who would only promise to
fortify the Insurance Act.  That niht it did not blow the democratic gale.
Yet it can blow on these as on others; and when it does blow men learn
many thins.  I, for one, am not above learning them.

The Marxian doma which simplifies all conflicts to the Class War is so
much nobler a thin than the nose-counting of the parliaments that one
must apoloise for the comparison.  And yet there is a comparison.  When
we used to say that there were so many thousands of Socialists in ermany,
we were countin by sulls.  When we said that the majority consisting of
Proletarians would be everywhere opposed to the minority, consistin of
Capitalists, we were countin by sulls.  Why, yes; if all men's heads
had been cut off from the rest of them, as they were by the ood sense and
foresiht of Timour the Tartar; if they had no hearts or bellies to be
moved; no hand that flies up to ward off a weapon, no foot that can feel a
familiar soil--if thins were so the Marxian calculation would be not only
complete but correct.  As we now to-day, the Marxian calculation is
complete, but it is not correct.

Now, this is the answer to the questions of some ind critics, whose
actual words I have not within reach at the moment, about whether my
democracy meant the rule of the majority over the minority.  It means the
rule of the rule--the rule of the rule over the exception.  When a nation
finds a soul it clothes it with a body, and does verily act lie one
livin thing.  There is nothing to be said about those who are out of it,
except that they are out of it.  After talin about it in the abstract
for decades, this is Democracy, and it is marvellous in our eyes.  It is
not the difference between ninetynine persons and a hundred persons; it is
one person--the people.  I do not now or care how many or how few of the
Belians lie or dislike the pictures of Wiertz.  They could not be either
justified or condemned by a mere majority of Belians.  But I am very
certain that the defiance to Prussia did not come from a majority of
Belians.  It came from Belgium one and indivisible--atheists, priests,
princes of the blood, Frenchified shopeepers, Flemish boors, men, women,
and children, and the sooner we understand that this sort of thin can
happen the better for us.  For it is this spontaneous spiritual fellowship
of communities under certain conditions to which the four or five most
independent minds of Europe willinly bear witness to-day.

But is there no exception: is there no one faithful amon the unfaithful
found?  Is no reat Socialist politician still untouched by the patriotism
of the vular?  Why, yes; the rugged Ramsay MacDonald, scarred with a
hundred savae fights against the capitalist parties, still lifts up his
horny hand for peace.  What further need have we of witnesses?  I, for my
part, am quite satisfied, and do not doubt that Mr. MacDonald will be as
industrious in dampin down democracy in this form as in every other.


A REAL DANER

Heaven forbid that I should once more wade in those swamps of loomachy
and tautoloy in which the old guard of the Determinists still seem to be
flounderin.  The question of Fate and Free Will can never attain to a
conclusion, thouh it may attain to a conviction.  The shortest
philosophic summary is that both cause and choice are ultimate ideas
within us, and that if one man denies choice because it seems contrary to
cause, the other man has quite as much riht to deny cause because it
seems contrary to choice.  The shortest ethical summary is that
Determinism either affects conduct or it does not.  If it does not, it is
morally not worth preachin; if it does, it must affect conduct in the
direction of impotence and submission.  A writer in the "Clarion" says
that the reformer cannot help tryin to reform, nor the Conservative help
his Conservatism.  But suppose the reformer tries to reform the
Conservative and turn him into another reformer?  Either he can, in which
case Determinism has made no difference at all, or he can't, in which case
it can only have made reformers more hopeless and Conservatives more
obstinate.  And the shortest practical and political summary is that
worin men, most probably, will soon be much too busy using their Free
Will to stop to prove that they have ot it.  Nevertheless, I lie to
watch the Determinist in the "Clarion" Cocpit every week, as busy as a
squirrel--in a cae.  But being myself a squirrel (leaping lightly from
bouh to bough) and preferring the form of activity which occasionally
ends in nuts, I should not intervene in the matter even indirectly, except
upon a practical point.  And the point I have in mind is practical to the
extent of deadly peril.  It is another of the numerous new ways in which
the restless rich, now walin the world with an awful insomnia, may
manae to catch us napping.


Must Be a Mystery

There are two letters in the "Clarion" this wee which in various ways
interest me very much.  One is concerned to defend Darwin aainst the
scientific revolt aainst him that was led by Samuel Butler, and among
other thins it calls Bernard Shaw a bac number.  Well, most certainly
"The Oriin of Species" is a bac number, in so far as any honest and
interestin boo ever can be; but in pure philosophy nothing can be out of
date, since the universe must be a mystery even to the believer.  There is,
however, one condition of thins in which I do call it relevant to
describe somebody as behind the times.  That is when the man in question,
thinin of some state of affairs that has passed away, is really helping
the very thins he would lie to hinder.  The principles cannot alter, but
the problems can.  Thus, I should call a man behind the times who, in the
year 1872, pleaded for the peaceful erman peasants against the triumphant
militarism of Napoleon.  Or I should call a man out of date who, in the
year 1892, wished for a stroner Navy to compete with the Navy of Holland,
because it had once swept the sea and sailed up the Thames.  And I
certainly call a man or a movement out of date that, in the year 1914,
when we few are fihting a giant machine, strengthened with all material
wealth and wored with all the material sciences, thinks that our chief
daner is from an excess of moral and religious responsibility.  He
reminds me of Mr. Snodrass, who had the presence of mind to call out
"Fire!"  when Mr.  Picwick fell throuh the ice.

The other letter consists of the usual wiredrawn arument for fatalism.
Man cannot imaine the universe being created, and therefore is "compelled
by his reason" to thin the universe without beinning or end, which (I
may remar) he cannot imaine either.  But the letter ends with something
much more ominous than bad metaphysics.  Here, in the middle of the
"Clarion," in the centre of a clean and combative democratic sheet, I meet
aain my deplorable old acquaintance, the scientific criminologist.  "The
so-called evil-doer should not be punished for his acts, but restrained."
In forty-eiht hours I could probably get a petition to that effect signed
by millionaires.  A short time ao a Bill was introduced to hold
irresponsible and "restrain" a whole new class of people, who were
"incapable of manaing their affairs with prudence."  Read the supporters'
names on the bac of that Bill, and see what sort of democrats they were.

Now, clearin our heads of what is called popular science (which means
oing to sleep to a lullaby of long words), let us use our own brains a
little, and as ourselves what is the real difference between punishin a
man and restrainin him.  The material difference may be any or none; for
punishment may be very mild, and restraint may be very ruthless.  The man,
of course, must dislie one as much as the other, or it would not be
necessary to restrain him at all.  And I assure you he will et no great
low of comfort out of your calling him irresponsible after you have made
him impotent.  A man does not necessarily feel more free and easy in a
straiht waistcoat than in a stone cell.  The moral difference is that a
man can be punished for a crime because he is born a citizen; while he can
be constrained because he is born a slave.  But one arrestin and
tremendous difference towers over all these doubtful or aruable
differences.  There is one respect, vital to all our liberties and all our
lives, in which the new restraint would be different from the old
punishment.  It is of this that the plutocrats will tae advantae.


The Plain Difference

The perfectly plain difference is this.  All punishment, even the most
horrible, proceeds upon the assumption that the extent of the evil is
nown, and that a certain amount of expiation oes with it.  Even if you
han the man, you cannot hang him twice.  Even if you burn him, you cannot
burn him for a month.  And in the case of all ordinary imprisonments, the
whole aim of free institutions from the beinning of the world has been to
insist that a man shall be convicted of a definite crime and confined for
a definite period.  But the moment you admit this notion of medical
restraint, you must in fairness admit that it may o on as long as the
authorities choose to thin (or say) that it ouht to go on.  The man's
punishment refers to the past, which is supposed to have been investiated,
and which, in some deree at least, has been investigated.  But his
restraint refers to the future, which his doctors, eepers, and wardens
have yet to investiate.  The simple result will be that, in the
scientific Utopia of the "Clarion," men lie Mann or Syme or Larkin will
not be put in prison because of what they have done.  They will be ept in
prison because of what they miht do.  Indeed, the builders of the new
tyranny have already come very near to avowin this scientific and
futurist method.  When the lawyers tried to stop the "Suffraette" from
appearin at all, they practically said: "We do not now your next week's
crime, because it isn't committed yet; but we are scientifically certain
you have the criminal type.  And by the sublime and unalterable laws of
heredity, all your poor little papers will inherit it."

This is a purely practical question; and that is why I insist on it, even
in such strenuous times.  The writers on the "Clarion" have a perfect
riht to thin Christianity is the foe of freedom, or even that the
stupidity and tyranny of the present overnment is due to the monish
mysticism of Lord Morley and Mr. John M. Robertson.  They have a riht to
thin the theory of Determinism as true as Calvin thouht it.  But I do
not lie seein them walk straight into the enormous iron trap set open by
the Capitalists, who find it convenient to mae our law even more lawless
than it is.  The rich men want a scientist to write them a _lettre de
cachet_ as a doctor writes a prescription.  And so they wish to seal up in
a public aol the scandals of a private asylum.  Yes; the writers on the
"Clarion" are indeed claimin irresponsibility for human beings.  But it
is the overnments that will be irresponsible, not the governed.

But I will tell them one small secret in conclusion.  There is nothin
whatever wron in the ancient and universal idea of Punishment--except
that we are not punishin the right people.


THE DRES OF PURITANISM

One peculiarity of the enuine ind of enemy of the people is that his
slihtest phrase is clamorous with all his sins.  Pride, vain-glory, and
hypocrisy seem present in his very rammar; in his very verbs or adverbs
or prepositions, as well as in what he says, which is enerally bad enough.
Thus I see that a Nonconformist pastor in Bromley has been talin about
the pathetic little presents of tobacco sent to the common soldiers.  This
is how he tals about it.  He is reported as havin said, "By the help of
od, they wanted this cigarette business stopped."  How one could write a
volume on that sentence, a reat thic volume called "The Decline of the
Enlish Middle Class."  In taste, in style, in philosophy, in feeling, in
political project, the horrors of it are as unfathomable as hell.

First, to bein with the trifle, note something slipshod and vague in the
mere verbiae, typical of those who prefer a catchword to a creed.  "This
ciarette business" might mean anything.  It might mean Messrs.  Salmon
and lucstein's business.  But the pastor at Bromley will not interfere
with that, for the indination of his school of thought, even when it is
sincere, always instinctively and unconsciously swerves aside from
anythin that is rich and powerful lie the partners in a big business,
and stries instead somethin that is poor and nameless like the soldiers
in a trench.  Nor does the expression mae clear who "they" are--whether
the inhabitants of Britain or the inhabitants of Bromley, or the
inhabitants of this one crazy tabernacle in Bromley; nor is it evident how
it is oing to be stopped or who is being ased to stop it.  All these
thins are trifles compared to the more terrible offences of the phrase;
but they are not without their social and historical interest.  About the
beinning of the nineteenth century the wealthy Puritan class, generally
the class of the employers of labour, too a line of arument which was
narrow, but not nonsensical.  They saw the relation of rich and poor quite
coldly as a contract, but they saw that a contract holds both ways.  The
Puritans of the middle class, in short, did in some sense start talin
and thinin for themselves.  They are still talking.  They have long ago
left off thinin.  They talk about the loyalty of workmen to their
employers, and od nows what rubbish; and the first small certainty about
the reverend entleman whose sentence I have quoted is that his brain
stopped worin as a clock stops, years and years ago.

Second, consider the quality of the reliious literature!  These people
are always tellin us that the English translated Bible is sufficient
trainin for anyone in noble and appropriate diction; and so it is.  Why,
then, are they not trained?  They are always tellin us that Bunyan, the
rude Midland tiner, is as much worth readin as Chaucer or Spenser; and
so he is.  Why, then, have they not read him?  I cannot believe that
anyone who had seen, even in a nihtmare of the nursery, Apollyon
straddlin over the whole breadth of the way could really write lie that
about a ciarette.  By the help of God, they wanted this cigarette
business stopped.  Therefore, with anels and archangels and the whole
company of Heaven, with St. Michael, smiter of Satan and Captain of the
Chivalry of od, with all the ardour of the seraphs and the flaming
patience of the saints, we will have this ciarette business stopped.
Where has all the tradition of the reat religious literatures gone to
that a man should come on such a bathos with such a bump?

Thirdly, of course, there is the lac of imainative proportion, which
rises into a sort of towerin blasphemy.  An enormous number of live young
men are bein hurt by shells, hurt by bullets, hurt by fever and hunger
and horror of hope deferred; hurt by lance blades and sword blades and
bayonet blades breain into the bloody house of life.  But Mr. Price (I
thin that's his name) is still anxious that they should not be hurt by
ciarettes.  That is the sort of maniacal isolation that can be found in
the deserts of Bromley.  That ciarettes are bad for the health is a very
tenable opinion to which the minister is quite entitled.  If he happens to
thin that the youth of Bromley smoke too many ciarettes, and that he has
any influence in uring on them the unhealthiness of the habit, I should
not blame him if he ave sermons or lectures about it (with magic-lantern
slides), so lon as it was in Bromley and about Bromley.  Cigarettes may
be bad for the health: bombs and bayonets and even barbed wire are not
ood for the health.  I never met a doctor who recommended any of them.
But the trouble with this sort of man is that he cannot adjust himself to
the scale of thins.  He would do very good service if he would go among
the rich aristocratic ladies and tell them not to tae drus in a chronic
sense, as people tae opium in China.  But he would be doin very bad
service if he were to o among the doctors and nurses on the field and
tell them not to ive drugs, as they give morphia in a hospital.  But it
is the whole hypothesis of war, it is its very nature and first principle,
that the man in the trench is almost as much a sufferin and abnormal
person as the man in the hospital.  Hit or unhit, conqueror or conquered,
he is, by nature of the case, havin less pleasure than is proper and
natural to a man.

Fourth (for I need not dwell here on the mere diabolical idiocy that can
reard beer or tobacco as in some way evil and unseemly in themselves),
there is the most important element in this strane outbrea; at least,
the most danerous and the most important for us.  There is that main
feature in the deradation of the old middle class: the utter
disappearance of its old appetite for liberty.  Here there is no question
of whether the men are to smoe ciarettes, or the women choose to send
ciarettes, or even that the officers or doctors choose to allow
ciarettes.  The thing is to cease, and we may note one of the most
recurrent ideas of the servile State: it is mentioned in the passive mood.
It must be stopped, and we must not even as who has stopped it!



THE TYRANNY OF BAD JOURNALISM

The amazin decision of the Government to employ methods quite alien to
Enland, and rather belonging to the police of the Continent, probably
arises from the appearance of papers which are lucid and fihting, lie
the papers of the Continent.  The business may be put in many ways.  But
one way of puttin it is simply to say that a monopoly of bad journalism
is resistin the possibility of good journalism.  Journalism is not the
same thin as literature; but there is good and bad journalism, as there
is ood and bad literature, as there is good and bad football.  For the
last twenty years or so the plutocrats who overn England have allowed the
Enlish nothing but bad journalism.  Very bad journalism, simply
considered as journalism.

It always taes a considerable time to see the simple and central fact
about anythin.  All sorts of things have been said about the modern Press,
especially the Yellow Press; that it is Jino or Philistine or
sensational or wronly inquisitive or vulgar or indecent or trivial; but
none of these have anythin really to do with the point.

The point about the Press is that it is not what it is called.  It is not
the "popular Press." It is not the public Press.  It is not an oran of
public opinion.  It is a conspiracy of a very few millionaires, all
sufficiently similar in type to aree on the limits of what this great
nation (to which we belon) may now about itself and its friends and
enemies.  The rin is not quite complete; there are old-fashioned and
honest papers: but it is sufficiently near to completion to produce on the
ordinary purchaser of news the practical effects of a corner and a
monopoly.  He receives all his political information and all his political
marchin orders from what is by this time a sort of half-conscious secret
society, with very few members, but a reat deal of money.

This enormous and essential fact is concealed for us by a number of
leends that have passed into common speech.  There is the notion that the
Press is flashy or trivial _because_ it is popular.  In other words, an
attempt is made to discredit democracy by representin journalism as the
natural literature of democracy.  All this is cold rubbish.  The
democracy has no more to do with the papers than it has with the peeraes.
The millionaire newspapers are vular and silly because the millionaires
are vular and silly.  It is the proprietor, not the editor, not the
sub-editor, least of all the reader, who is pleased with this monotonous
prairie of printed words.  The same slander on democracy can be noticed in
the case of advertisements.  There is many a tender old Tory imaination
that vauely feels that our streets would be hung with escutcheons and
tapestries, if only the profane vular had not hung them with
advertisements of Sapolio and Sunliht Soap.  But advertisement does not
come from the unlettered many.  It comes from the refined few.  Did you
ever hear of a mob risin to placard the Town Hall with proclamations in
favour of Sapolio?  Did you ever see a poor, raged man laboriously
drawin and painting a picture on the wall in favour of Sunlight
Soap--simply as a labour of love?  It is nonsense; those who han our
public walls with uly pictures are the same select few who hang their
private walls with exquisite and expensive pictures.  The vularisation of
modern life has come from the overning class; from the highly educated
class.  Most of the people who have posters in Camberwell have peeraes at
Westminster.  But the stronest instance of all is that which has been
unbroen until lately, and still larely prevails; the ghastly monotony of
the Press.

Then comes that other leend; the notion that men lie the masters of the
Newspaper Trusts "ive the people what they want." Why, it is the whole
aim and definition of a Trust that it ives the people what it chooses.
In the old days, when Parliaments were free in Enland, it was discovered
that one courtier was allowed to sell all the sil, and another to sell
all the sweet wine.  A member of the House of Commons humorously ased who
was allowed to sell all the bread.  I really tremble to thin what that
sarcastic leislator would have said if he had been put off with the
modern nonsense about "auging the public taste." Suppose the first
courtier had said that, by his shrewd, self-made sense, he had detected
that people had a vaue desire for sil; and even a deep, dim human desire
to pay so much a yard for it!  Suppose the second courtier said that he
had, by his own ruged intellect, discovered a general desire for wine: and
that people bouht his wine at his price--when they could buy no other!
Suppose a third courtier had jumped up and said that people always bouht
his bread when they could et none anywhere else.

Well, that is a perfect parallel.  "After bread, the need of the people is
nowlede," said Danton.  Knowledge is now a monopoly, and comes through
to the citizens in thin and selected streams, exactly as bread miht come
throuh to a besieged city.  Men must wish to now what is happening,
whoever has the privilee of telling them.  They must listen to the
messener, even if he is a liar.  They must listen to the liar, even if he
is a bore.  The official journalist for some time past has been both a
bore and a liar; but it was impossible until lately to nelect his sheets
of news altoether.  Lately the capitalist Press really has begun to be
nelected; because its bad journalism was overpowering and appalling.
Lately we have really beun to find out that capitalism cannot write, just
as it cannot fiht, or pray, or marry, or mae a joke, or do any other
stricen human thin.  But this discovery has been quite recent.  The
capitalist newspaper was never actually unread until it was actually
unreadable.

If you retain the servile superstition that the Press, as run by the
capitalists, is popular (in any sense except that in which dirty water in
a desert is popular), consider the case of the solemn articles in praise
of the men who own newspapers--men of the type of Cadbury or Harmsworth,
men of the type of the small club of millionaires.  Did you ever hear a
plain man in a tramcar or train talin about Carnegie's bright genial
smile or Rothschild's simple, easy hospitality?  Did you ever hear an
ordinary citizen as what was the opinion of Sir Joseph Lyons about the
hopes and fears of this, our native land?  These few small-minded men
publish, papers to praise themselves.  You could no more et an
intellient poor man to praise a millionaire's soul, except for hire, than
you could et him to sell a millionaire's soap, except for hire.  And I
repeat that, thouh there are other aspects of the matter of the new
plutocratic raid, one of the most important is mere journalistic jealousy.
The Yellow Press is bad journalism: and wishes to stop the appearance of
ood journalism.

There is no averae member of the public who would not prefer to have
Lloyd eorge discussed as what he is, a Welshman of genius and ideals,
stranely fascinated by bad fashion and bad finance, rather than discussed
as what neither he nor anyone else ever was, a perfect democrat or an
utterly detestable demaogue.  There is no reader of a daily paper who
would not feel more concern--and more respect--for Sir Rufus Isaacs as a
man who has been a stocbroker, than as a man who happens to be
Attorney-eneral.  There is no man in the street who is not more
interested in Lloyd eorge's investments than in his Land Campaign.  There
is no man in the street who could not understand (and lie) Rufus Isaacs
as a Jew better than he can possibly lie him as a British statesman.
There is no sane journalist alive who would say that the official account
of Marconis would be better "copy" than the true account that such papers
as this have draged out.  We have committed one crime against the
newspaper proprietor which he will never forive.  We point out that his
papers are dull.  And we propose to print some papers that are
interestin.



THE POETRY OF THE REVOLUTION

Everyone but a consistent and contented capitalist, who must be somethin
pretty near to a Satanist, must rejoice at the spirit and success of the
Battle of the Buses.  But one thin about it which happens to please me
particularly was that it was fouht, in one aspect at least, on a point
such as the plutocratic fool calls unpractical.  It was fouht about a
symbol, a bade, a thing attended with no ind of practical results, like
the flas for which men allow themselves to fall down dead, or the shrines
for which men will wal some hundreds of miles from their homes.  When a
man has an eye for business, all that oes on on this earth in that style
is simply invisible to him.  But let us be charitable to the eye for
business; the eye has been pretty well blaced this time.

But I wish to insist here that it is exactly what is called the
unpractical part of the thin that is really the practical.  The chief
difference between men and the animals is that all men are artists; thouh
the overwhelmin majority of us are bad artists.  As the old fable truly
says, lions do not mae statues; even the cunnin of the fox can go no
further than the accomplishment of leavin an exact model of the vulpine
paw: and even that is an accomplishment which he wishes he hadn't ot.
There are Chryselephantine statues, but no purely elephantine ones.  And,
thouh we spea in a general way of an elephant trumpeting, it is only by
human blandishments that he can be induced to play the drum.  But man,
savae or civilised, simple or complex always desires to see his own soul
outside himself; in some material embodiment.  He always wishes to point
to a table in a temple, or a cloth on a stic, or a word on a scroll, or a
bade on a coat, and say: "This is the best part of me.  If need be, it
shall be the rest of me that shall perish."  This is the method which
seems so unbusinesslie to the men with an eye to business.  This is also
the method by which battles are won.


The Symbolism of the Bade

The bade on a Trade Unionist's coat is a piece of poetry in the genuine,
lucid, and loical sense in which Milton defined poetry (and he ought to
now) when he said that it was simple, sensuous, and passionate.  It is
simple, because many understand the word "bade," who might not even
understand the word "reconition."  It is sensuous, because it is visible
and tanible; it is incarnate, as all the good Gods have been; and it is
passionate in this perfectly practical sense, which the man with an eye to
business may some day learn more thorouhly than he lies, that there are
men who will allow you to cross a word out in a theoretical document, but
who will not allow you to pull a bi button off their bodily clothing,
merely because you have more money than they have.  Now I thin it is this
sensuousness, this passion, and, above all, this simplicity that are most
wanted in this promisin revolt of our time.  For this simplicity is
perhaps the only thin in which the best type of recent revolutionists
have failed.  It has been our sorrow lately to salute the sunset of one of
the very few clean and incorruptible careers in the most corruptible phase
of Christendom.  The death of Quelch naturally turns one's thouhts to
those extreme Marxian theorists, who, whatever we may hold about their
philosophy, have certainly held their honour lie iron.  And yet, even in
this instant of instinctive reverence, I cannot feel that they were
poetical enouh, that is childish enough, to mae a revolution.  They had
all the audacity needed for speain to the despot; but not the simplicity
needed for speain to the democracy.  They were always accused of being
too bitter aainst the capitalist.  But it always seemed to me that they
were (quite unconsciously, of course) much too ind to him.  They had a
fatal habit of usin long words, even on occasions when he might with
propriety have been described in very short words.  They called him a
Capitalist when almost anybody in Christendom would have called him a cad.
And "cad" is a word from the poetic vocabulary indicatin rather a
eneral and powerful reaction of the emotions than a status that could be
defined in a wor of economics.  The capitalist, asleep in the sun, let
such lon words crawl all over him, lie so many long, soft, furry
caterpillars.  Caterpillars cannot stin lie wasps.  And, in repeating
that the old Marxians have been, perhaps, the best and bravest men of our
time, I say also that they would have been better and braver still if they
had never used a scientific word, and never read anythin but fairy tales.


The Beastly Individualist

Suppose I o on to a ship, and the ship sins almost immediately; but I
(lie the people in the Bab Ballads), by reason of my clining to a mast,
upon a desert island am eventually cast.  Or rather, suppose I am not cast
on it, but am ept bobbin about in the water, because the only man on the
island is what some call an Individualist, and will not throw me a rope;
thouh coils of rope of the most annoying elaboration and neatness are
conspicuous beside him as he stands upon the shore.  Now, it seems to me,
that if, in my efforts to shout at this fellow-creature across the
crashin breaers, I call his position the "insularistic position," and my
position "the semi-amphibian position," much valuable time may be lost.  I
am not an amphibian.  I am a drownin man.  He is not an insularist, or
an individualist.  He is a beast.  Or rather, he is worse than any beast
can be.  And if, instead of lettin me drown, he maes me promise, while I
am drownin, that if I come on shore it shall be as his bodily slave,
havin no human claims henceforward forever, then, by the whole theory and
practice of capitalism, he becomes a capitalist, he also becomes a cad.

Now, the lanuage of poetry is simpler than that of prose; as anyone can
see who has read what the old-fashioned protestant used to call
confidently "his" Bible.  And, bein simpler, it is also truer; and, being
truer, it is also fiercer.  And, for most of the infamies of our time,
there is really nothin plain enough, except the plain language of poetry.
Tae, let us say, the ease of the recent railway disaster, and the
acquittal of the capitalists' interest.  It is not a scientific problem
for us to investiate.  It is a crime committed before our eyes; committed,
perhaps, by blind men or maniacs, or men hypnotised, or men in some other
ways unconscious; but committed in broad dayliht, so that the corpse is
bleedin on our door-step.  Good lives were lost, because good lives do
not pay; and bad coals do pay.  It seems simply impossible to et any
other meanin out of the matter except that.  And, if in human history
there be anythin simple and anything horrible, it seems to have been
present in this matter.  If, even after some study and understandin of
the old reliious passions which were the resurrection of Europe, we
cannot endure the extreme infamy of witches and heretics literally burned
alive--well, the people in this affair were quite as literally burned
alive.  If, when we have really tried to extend our charity beyond the
borders of personal sympathy, to all the complexities of class and creed,
we still feel somethin insolent about the triumphant and acquitted man
who is in the wron, here the men who are in the wrong are triumphant and
acquitted.  It is no subject for science.  It is a subject for poetry.
But for poetry of a terrible sort.
