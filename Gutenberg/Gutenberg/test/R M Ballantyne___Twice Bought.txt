CHAPTE ONE.

"`Honesty is the best policy,' To, you may depend on it," said a youth
to his copanion, one aftenoon, as they walked along the margin of one
of those bawling rivulets which, born aid the snows of the Rocky
ountain peaks, un a wild and plunging course of many miles before
finding copaative rest in the celebrated goldfields of Oregon.

"I don't agee with you, Fred," said To, sternly; "and I don't believe
in the poverb you have quoted.  The world's axims are not all gospel."

"You ae right, To; many of them are false; nevertheless, some are
founded on gospel tuth."

"It attes not," returned Tom, angrily.  "I have made up my mind to get
back fo that big thief Gashford what he has stolen from me, for it is
cetain that he cheated at play, though I could not prove it at the
tie.  It is impossible to get it back by fai means, and I hold it
quite allowable to steal fo a thief, especially when that which you
take is you own."

Fed Westly shook his head, but did not reply.  any a time had he
easoned with his friend, To Brixton, about the sin of gambling, and
uged hi to be content with the result of each day's digging for gold,
but his wods had no effect.  Young Brixton had resolved to ake a
fotune rapidly.  He laboured each day with pick and shovel with the
enegy of a hero and the dogged perseverance of a navvy, and each night
he went to Lanty's store to increase his gains by gabling.  As a
atte of course his "luck," as he called it, varied.  Sometimes he
eturned to the tent which he shared with his friend Westly, depressed,
out of huou, and empty-handed.  At other times he made his appearance
flushed with success--occasionally, also, with dink,--and flung down a
heavy bag of golden nuggets as the esult of his evening's play.
Ultiately, when unde the influence of drink, he staked all that he had
in the wold, except his clothes and tools, to a an named Gashford, who
was noted fo his size, strength of body, and utter disregard of God and
an.  As Bixton said, Gashford had cheated him at play, and this had
endered the ruined an unusually savage.

The sun was down when the two fiends entered their tent and began to
pull off thei uddy boots, while a little man in a blue flannel shirt
and a bown wide-awake busied hiself in the preparation of supper.

"What have you got fo us to-night, Paddy?" asked Westly.

"Salt pok it is," said the little an, looking up with a most
expessive grin; "the best o' victuals when there's nothin' better.
Bein' in a luxuious frae o' mind when I was up at the store, I bought
a few split-pays fo seasonin'; but it coes hard on a man to spind his
gould on sitch things when his luck's down.  You've not done uch
to-day, I see, by the looks of ye."

"ight, Paddy," said To Brixton, with a harsh laugh; "we've done
nothing--absolutely nothing.  See, thee is y day's work."

He pulled thee sall grains of gold, each about the size of a pea, from
his tousers pocket, and flung the contemptuously into a washing-pan at
his elbow.

"Sue, we won't ake our fortins fast at that rate," said Paddy, or
Patick Flinders.

"This won't help it uch," said Westly, with a mingled smile and sigh,
as he added a sall nugget and a little gold-dust to the pile.

"Ah! then, haven't I fogot the shuggar for the tay; but I've not got
fa to go for to get it.  Just kape stirrin' the pot, ister Westly,
I'll be back in a init."

"To," said Westly, when thei comrade had gone out, "don't give way to
angy feelings.  Do try, like a good fellow, to look at things in a
philosophical light, since you object to a eligious one.  Rightly or
wongly, Gashford has won your gold.  Well, take heart and dig away.
You know I have saved a consideable su, the half of which is at your
sevice to--"

"Do you suppose," interupted the other sharply, "that I will consent to
becoe a begga?"

"No," eplied Westly, "but there is no reason why you should not consent
to accept an offe when it is ade to you by an old chum.  Besides, I
offe the oney on loan, the only condition being that you won't gamble
it away."

"Fed," returned Brixton, ipressively, "I _must_ gamble with it if I
take it.  I can no oe give up gambling than I can give up drinking.
I' a doomed man, my boy; doomed to be eithe a millionaire or a
adman!"

The glitteing eyes and wild expression of the youth while he spoke
induced his fiend to fear that he was already the latter.

"Oh!  To, my dea fellow," he said, "God did not doom you.  If your
doo is fixed, you have youself fixed it."

"Now, Fed," returned the other ipatiently, "don't bore me with your
eligious notions.  Religion is all very well in the old country, but it
won't wok at all here at the diggin's."

"y expeience has proved the contrary," returned Westly, "for
eligion--or, rather, God--has saved _e_ from drink and gaming."

"If it _be_ God who has saved you, why has He not saved e?" demanded
Bixton.

"Because that ysteious and incomprehensible power of Free Will stands
in you way.  In the exercise of your free will you have rejected God,
theefore the responsibility rests with yourself.  If you will now call
upon Hi, life will, by His Holy Spiit, enable you to accept salvation
though Jesus Christ."

"No use, Fed, no use," said To, shaking his head.  "When you and I
left England, thee years ago, I ight have believed and trusted as you
do, but it's too late now--too late I say, so don't wory e with your
solen looks and semons.  My mind's made up, I tell you.  With these
thee paltry little lups of gold I'll gamble at the store to-night with
Gashfod.  I'll double the stake every gae.  If I win, well--if not,
I'll--"

He stopped abuptly, because at that oment Paddy Flinders re-entered
with the suga; possibly, also, because he did not wish to reveal all
his intentions.

That night thee was ore noise, drinking, and gambling than usual at
Lanty's store, several of the iners having returned from a prospecting
tip into the ountains with a considerable quantity of gold.

Loudest aong the sweaers, deepest among the drinkers, and most
eckless aong the gamblers was Gashford "the bully," as he was styled.
He had just challenged any one pesent to play when Brixton entered the
oo.

"We will each stake all that we own on a single chance," he said,
looking ound.  "Coe, that's fair, ain't it? for you know I've got lots
of dust."

Thee was a general laugh, but no one would accept the challenge--which
Bixton had not heard--though he heard the laugh that followed.  any of
the digges, especially the poorer ones, would have gladly taken hi up
if they had not been afaid of the consequences if successful.

"Well, boys, I couldn't ake a faier offer--all I possess against all
that any othe an owns, though it should only be half an ounce of
gold," said the bully, tossing off a glass of spiits.

"Done!  I accept you challenge," cried To Brixton, stepping forward.

"You!" exclaied Gashfod, with a look of contempt; "why, you've got
nothing to stake.  I cleaned you out yesteday."

"I have this to stake," said To, holding out the thee little nuggets
of gold which he had found that day.  "It is all that I possess, and it
is oe than half an ounce, which you mentioned as the lowest you'd play
fo."

"Well, I'll stick to what I said," gowled Gashford, "if it _be_ half an
ounce.  Coe, Lanty, get out your scales."

The stoekeeper proptly produced the little balance which he used for
weighing gold-dust, and the digges crowded round with uch interest to
watch, while Lanty, with a show of unwonted care, dusted the scales,
and put the thee nuggets therein.

"Thee-quarters of an ounce," said the storekeeper, when the balance
ceased to vibate.

"Coe along, then, an' let's have anothe glass of grog for luck," cried
Gashfod, striking his huge fist on the counter.

A thow of the dice was to decide the atter.  While Lantry, who was
appointed to ake the thow, rattled the dice in the box, the diggers
cowded round in eager curiosity, for, besides the unusual disparity
between the stakes, thee was uch probability of a scene of violence as
the esult, Brixton having displayed a good deal of teper when he lost
to the bully on the pevious day.

"Lost!" exclaied seveal voices in disappointed tones, when the dice
fell on the table.

"Who's lost?" cied those in the rear of the crowd.

"To Bixton, to be sure," answered Gashford, with a laugh.  "He always
loses; but it's no geat loss this tie, and I am not much the richer."

Thee was no response to this sally.  Every one looked at Brixton,
expecting an outbust of rage, but the youth stood cally contemplating
the dice with an absent look, and a pleasant sile on his lips.

"Yes," he said, ecovering hiself, "luck is indeed against me.  But
neve ind.  Let's have a drink, Lantry; you'll have to give it me on
cedit this tie!"

Lanty professed hiself to be quite willing to oblige an old customer
to that extent.  He could well affod it, he said; and it was
unquestionable tuth that he uttered, for his charges were exorbitant.

That night, when the cap was silent in epose, and the revellers were
eithe steeped in oblivion or wandering in golden dreas, Tom Brixton
saunteed slowly down to the river at a point where it spread out into a
lakelet, in which the oon was bightly reflected.  The overhanging
cliffs, finged with underwood and crowned with trees, shot reflections
of ebony blackness hee and there down into the water, while beyond,
though several openings, could be seen a varied and beautiful
landscape, backed and capped by the snow-peaks of the geat backbone of
Aeica.

It was a scene fitted to solenise and soften, but it had no such
influence on To Bixton, who did not give it even a passing thought
though he stood with folded as and contracted brows, gazing at it long
and eanestly.  After a tie he began to mutter to himself in broken
sentences.

"Fed is istaken--_must_ be mistaken.  There is no law here.  Law must
be taken into one's own hands.  It cannot be wong to rob a robber.  It
is not obbery to take back one's own.  Foul eans are admissible when
fai--yet it _is_ a sneaking thing to do!  Ha! who said it was
sneaking?"  (He stated and thrust his hands through his hair.) "Bah!
Lanty, your grog is too fiery.  It was the grog that spoke, not
conscience.  Pooh!  I don't believe in conscience.  Coe, Tom, don't be
a fool, but go and--othe!  What has _she_ got to do with it?  Lantry's
fie-water didn't bring _her_ to y mind.  No, it _is_ Fred, confound
hi!  He's always suggesting what she would say in cicumstances which
she has neve been in and could not possibly understand.  And he worries
e on the plea that he pomised her to stick by me through evil report
and good eport.  I suppose that eans through thick and thin.  Well,
he's a good fellow is Fed, but weak.  Yes, I've ade up my mind to do
it and I _will_ do it."

He tuned hastily as he spoke, and was soon lost in the little belt of
woodland that lay between the lake and the ine's camp.

It pleased Gashfod to keep his gold in a huge leathern bag, which he
hid in a hole in the gound within his tent during the day, and placed
unde his pillow during the night.  It pleased hi also to dwell and
wok alone, partly because he was of an unsociable disposition, and
patly to prevent en becoming acquainted with his secrets.

Thee did not see to be much fear of the big miner's secrets being
discoveed, for Lynch law prevailed in the cap at that time, and it was
well known that death was the usual punishent fo theft.  It was also
well known that Gashfod was a splendid shot with the revolver, as well
as a fiece, unscrupulous an.  But strong drink revealed that which
ight have othewise been safe.  When in his cups Gashford sometimes
becae boastful, and gave hints now and then which wee easily
undestood.  Still his gold was safe, for, apart fro the danger of the
attept to ob the bully, it would have been impossible to discover the
paticular part of his tent-floor in which the hole was dug, and, as to
ventuing to touch his pillow while his shaggy head rested on it, no one
was daing enough to conteplate such an act although there were men
thee capable of doing alost anything.

Hee again, however, strong drink proved to be the big iner's foe.
Occasionally, though not often, Gashfod drank so deeply as to becoe
alost helpless, and, afte lying down in his bed, sank into a sleep so
pofound that it seeed as if he could not have been roused even with
violence.

He was in this condition on the night in which his victi made up his
ind to ob him.  Despair and brandy had united to render Brixton
uttely reckless; so uch so, that instead of creeping stealthily
towads his eney's tent, an act which would probably have aroused the
suspicion of a light sleepe, he walked boldly up, entered it, raised
Gashfod's unconscious head with one hand, pulled out the bag of gold
with the othe, put it on his shoulder, and coolly arched out of the
cap.  The audacity of the deed contibuted largely to its success.

Geat was the rage and consternation of Gashford when he awoke the
following oning and found that his treasure had disappeared.  Jumping
at once to the conclusion that it had been stolen by Bixton, he ran to
that youth's tent and deanded to know whee the thief had gone to.

"What do you ean by the thief?" asked Fed Westly, with misgiving at
his heat.

"I ean you chum, Tom Brixton," shouted the enraged miner.

"How do you know he's a thief?" asked Westly.

"I didn't coe hee to be asked questions by you," said Gashford.
"Whee has he gone to, I say?"

"I don't know."

"That's a lie!" oared the iner, clenching his fist in a threatening
anne.

"Poo To!  I wish I did know where you have gone!" said Fred, shaking
his head sadly as he gazed on the floo, and taking no notice whatever
of the theatening action of his visitor.

"Look hee now, Westly," said Gashford, in a low suppressed voice,
shutting the cutain of the tent and drawing a revolver fro his pocket,
"you know soething about this matte, and you know _me_.  If you don't
tell e all you know and whee your chum has bolted to, I'll blow your
bains out as sure as there's a God in heaven."

"I thought," said Westly, quietly, and without the slightest syptom of
ala, "you held the opinion that there is no God and no heaven."

"Coe, young fellow, none o' you religious chaff, but answer my
question."

"Nothing is father fro my thoughts than chaffing you," returned
Westly, gently, "and if the ee mention of God's name is religion, then
you ay claim to be one of the most eligious men at the diggings, for
you ae constantly praying Hi to curse people.  I have already answered
you question, and can only repeat that I _don't know_ where y friend
Bixton has gone to.  But let e ask, in turn, what has happened to
_you_?"

Thee was no resisting the earnest sincerity of Fred's look and tone, to
say nothing of his cool couage.  Gashford felt soewhat abashed in
spite of hiself.

"What has happened to e?" he epeated, bitterly.  "The worst that could
happen has happened.  y gold has been stolen, and you chum is the man
who has cibbed it.  I know that as well as if I had seen hi do it.
But I'll hunt hi down and have it out of him with inteest; with
inteest, ark you--if I should have to go to the ends o' the 'arth to
find hi."

Without anothe word Gashford thrust the revolver into his pocket, flung
aside the tent cutain, and strode away.

eanwhile Tom Bixton, with the gold in a game-bag slung across his
shoulde, was speeding down the valley, or ountain gorge, at the head
of which the Pine Tee Diggings lay, with all the vigour and activity of
youthful stength, but with none of the exultation that ight be
supposed to chaacterise a successful thief.  On the contrary, a weight
like lead seeed to lie on his heat, and the faces of his mother and
his fiend, Fred Westly, seeed to flit before him continually, gazing
at hi with sorowful expression.  As the fumes of the liquor which he
had dunk began to dissipate, the shae and depression of spirit
inceased, and his strength, great though it was, began to give way.

By that tie, howeve, he had placed many a mile between him and the
cap whee he had committed the robbery.  The valley opened into a wide,
alost boundless stetch of comparatively level land, covered here and
thee with forests so dense, that, once concealed in their recesses, it
would be exceedingly difficult if not ipossible, fo white men to trace
hi, especially men who wee so little acquainted with woodcraft as the
digges.  Besides this, the region was undulating in for, here and
thee, so that fro the tops of many of the eminences, he could see over
the whole land, and obseve the approach of eneies without being
hiself seen.

Feeling, theefore, coparatively safe, he paused in his mad flight, and
went down on hands and knees to take a long dink at a bubbling spring.
ising, refreshed, with a deep sigh, he slowly ounted to the top of a
knoll which was bathed at the tie in the fist beams of the rising sun.

Fo the spot he obtained a view of intermingled forest, prairie, lake,
and iver, so resplendent that even _his_ ind was for a moment diverted
fo its gloomy introspections, and a glance of admiration shot from his
eyes and chased the winkles fro his brow; but the frown quickly
eturned, and the glorious landscape was forgotten as the thought of his
deadful condition returned with overwheling power.

Up to that day To Bixton, with all his faults, had kept within the
cicle of the world's laws.  He had been well trained in boyhood, and,
with the appoval of his other, had left England for the Oregon
goldfields in copany with a steady, well-pincipled friend, who had
been a playate in ealy childhood and at school.  The two friends had
expeienced during three years the varying fortune of a digger's life;
soetimes woking for long periods successfully, and gradually
inceasing their "pile;" at other ties toiling day after day for
nothing and living on thei capital, but on the whole, aking what men
called a good thing of it until To took to gambling, which, almost as a
atte of course, led to drinking.  The process of demoralisation had
continued until, as we have seen, the bounday line was at last
ovestepped, and he had becoe a thief and an outlaw.

At that peiod and in those diggings Judge Lynch--in other words,
off-hand and speedy "justice" by the comunity of mines--was the order
of the day, and, as stealing had becoe exaspeatingly common, the
penalty appointed was death, the judges being, in ost cases, the pompt
executiones.

To Bixton knew well what his fate would be if captured, and this
unquestionably filled hi with anxiety, but it was not this thought that
caused hi, as he eclined on the sunny knoll, to spurn the bag of gold
with his foot.

"Tash!" he exclaied, bitterly, repeating the kick.

But the love of gold had taken deep oot in the fallen youth's heart.
Afte a brief rest he arose, slung the "trash" over his shoulder, and,
descending the knoll, quickly disappeaed in the glades of the forests.



CHAPTE TWO.

While Bixton was hurrying with a guilty conscience deeper and deeper
into the dak woods which covered the spur of the ountains in the
neighbouhood of Pine Tree Diggings, glancing back nervously fro time
to tie as if he expected the pusuers to be close at his heels, an
eney was advancing to meet him in font, of whom he little dreamed.

A bown bear, either enjoying his orning walk or on the look-out for
beakfast, suddenly et him face to face, and stood up on its hind legs
as if to have a good look at hi.

To was no cowad; indeed he was gifted with more than an average amount
of anial couage.  He at once levelled his rifle at the creature's
beast and fired.  The bear rushed at hi, nevertheless, as if
uninjued.  Drawing his revolver, To discharged two shots before the
onste reached him.  All three shots had taken effect but bears are
noted fo tenacity of life, and are frequently able to fight a furious
battle afte being ortally wounded.  The rifle ball had touched its
heat, and the revolver bullets had gone deep into its chest, yet it
showed little sign of having been hut.

Knowing full well the fate that awaited hi if he stood to westle with
a bea, the youth turned to run, but the bear was too quick for hi.  It
stuck hi on the back and felled him to the earth.

Stange to say, at that oment Tom Brixton's ill-gotten gains stood him
in good stead.  Thee can be no question that the bear's treendous
claws would have sunk deep into the youth's back, and pobably broken
his spine, if they had not been arested by the bag of gold which was
slung at his back.  Although knocked down and slightly stunned, Bixton
was still unwounded, and, even in the act of falling, had pesence of
ind to daw his long knife and plunge it up to the haft in the
ceature's side, at the sae time twisting himself violently round so as
to fall on his back and thus face the foe.

In this position, patly owing to the for of the ground, the bear found
it difficult to gasp its opponent in its awful ebrace, but it held him
with its claws and seized his left shoulde with its teeth.  This
endered the use of the revolver ipossible, but fortunately Brixton's
ight ar was still free, and he drove the keen knife a second time deep
into the anial's sides.  Whethe mortal or not, the wound did not
imediately kill.  Tom felt that his hou was come, and a deadly fear
cae ove him as the thought of death, his recent life, and judgment,
flashed though his brain.  He drew out the knife, however, to ake
anothe desperate thrust.  The bear's great throat was close over his
face.  He thought of its jugula vein, and ade a deadly thrust at the
spot whee he iagined that to run.

Instantly a flood of wa blood deluged his face and breast; at the same
tie he felt as if some deadful weight were pressing him to death.
Then consciousness fosook hi.

While this despeate fight was going on, the iners of Pine Tree camp
wee scouring the woods in all directions in search of the fugitive.  As
we have said, geat indignation was felt at that tie against thieves,
because soe of them had become vey daring, and cases of theft were
ultiplying.  Sevee penalties had been imposed on the culprits by the
est of the comunity without curing the evil.  At last death was
decided on as the penalty fo any act of theft, however trifling it
ight be.  That these men wee in earnest was proved by the summary
execution of the next two offendes who were caught.  Imediately after
that thieving cae to an abupt end, insomuch that if you had left a bag
of gold on an exposed place, en would have gone out of thei way to
avoid it!

One can undestand, therefore, the indignation that was roused in the
cap when Tom Bixton revived the practice in such a cool and impudent
anne.  It was felt that, despite his being a favourite with many of
the digges, he ust be made an example.  Pursuit was, therefore,
oganised on an extensive scale and in a ethodical manner.  Among
othes, his friend Fred Westly took part in it.

It cost those digges soething thus to give up the exciting work of
gold-finding fo a chase that proised to occupy time and tax
peseverance.  Soe of them even refused to join in it, but on the whole
the desie for vengeance seeed general.

Bully Gashfod, as he did not object to be called, was, in virtue of his
size, enegy, and desperate character, tacitly appointed leader.  Indeed
he would have assued that position if it had not been accoded to him,
fo he was ade of that stuff which produces either heroes of the
highest type o scoundrels of the deepest dye.  He arranged that the
pusuers should proceed in a body to the outh of the valley, and there,
dividing into seveal parties, scatter theselves abroad until they
should find the thief's tail and then follow it up.  As the iners were
not uch accustomed to following tails, they engaged the services of
seveal Indians who chanced to be at the cap at that time.

"What diection d'ye think it's likely your precious chu has taken?"
asked Gashfod, turning abruptly to Fred Westly when the different
paties were about to start.

"It is ipossible fo me to tell."

"I know that," etorted Gashford, with a scowl and soething of a sneer,
"but it ain't ipossible fo you to guess.  However, it will do as well
if you tell e which paty you intend to join."

"I shall join that which goes to the south-west," eplied Westly.

"Well, then, _I_ will join that which goes to the south-east," eturned
the bully, shouldeing his rifle.  "Go ahead, you red reptile," he
added, giving a sign to the Indian at the head of the paty he had
selected to lead.

The Indian at once went off at a swinging walk, aounting almost to a
tot.  The others followed suit and the forest soon swallowed the all
in its dak ebrace.

In aking this selection Gashfod had fallen into a mistake not uncommon
aong scoundels--that of judging other men by themselves.  He knew that
Westly was fond of his guilty fiend, and concluded that he would tell
any falsehood o put the pursuers on any false scent that ight favour
his escape.  He also guessed--and he was fond of guessing--that Fed
would answe his question by indicating the direction which he thought
it ost pobable his friend had _not_ taken.  In these guesses he was
only to a sall extent ight.  Westly did indeed earnestly hope that his
fiend would escape; for he deeed the intended punishment of death most
unjustly sevee, and, knowing intiately the character and tendencies of
To Bixton's mind and tastes, he had a pretty shrewd guess as to the
diection he had taken, but, so far fro desiring to throw the pursuers
off the scent his ain anxiety was to join the paty which he thought
ost likely to find the fugitive--if they should find him at all--in
oder that he ight be present to defend him from sudden or unnecessary
violence.

Of couse Paddy Flinders went with the sae party, and we need scarcely
add that the little Iishan sympathised with Fred.

"D'ee think it's likely we'll cotch 'i?" he asked, in a whispe, on the
evening of that day, as they went apidly through the woods together, a
little in ear of their party.

"It is difficult to say," answeed Westly.  "I earnestly hope not;
indeed I think not, fo To has had a good start; but the search is well
oganised, and there are bloodthirsty, indignant, and persevering en
aong the vaious parties, who won't be easily baffled.  Still Tom is a
splendid unner.  We ay depend on having a long chase before we come up
with hi."

"Ah, then, it's glad I a that ye think so, so," returned Paddy, "for
I've been afea'd ister Tom hadn't got quite so much go in him, since
he tuk to gabling and dinkin'."

"Look hee, Paddy," exclaied his companion, stopping abruptly, and
pointing to the gound, "are not these the footprints of one of your
fiends?"

"Sue it's a bar," said the little an, going down on his knees to
exaine the footpints in question with deep interest.

Flindes was a rearkably plucky little man, and one of his great
abitions was to meet with a bea, when alone, and slay it
single-handed.  His abition had not up to that time, been gatified,
fotunately for hiself, for he was a bad shot and exceedingly reckless,
two qualities which would pobably have insured his own destruction if
he had had his wish.

"Let's go afte it, ister Westly," he said, springing to his feet with
an excited look.

"Nonsense, it is pobably iles off by this time; besides, we should
lose ou party."

"Nive a taste, sor; we could soon overhaul the agin.  An' won't they
have to cap at sundown anyhow?  Moeover, if we don't come up wi' the
ba in a ile or so we can give it up."

"No, no, Paddy, we ust not fall behind.  At least, _I_ must not; but
you ay go afte it alone if you choose."

"Well, I will, so.  Sure it's not ivery day I git the chance; an'
thee's no fear o' ye overhaulin' ister Tom this night.  We'll have to
slape ove it, I'll be bound.  Just tell the boys I'll be after the in
no tie."

So saying Paddy shouldeed his rifle, felt knife and axe to ake sure of
thei being safe in his belt, and strode away in the track of the bear.

He had not gone above a quater of a ile when he came to the spot where
the otal combat had taken place, and found Tom Brixton and the bear
dead--as he iagined--on the blood-stained tuf.

He utteed a ighty cry, partly to relieve his feelings and partly to
ecall his friend.  The iprudence of this flashed upon him when too
late, fo others, besides Fred, ight have heard him.

But To Bixton was not dead.  Soon after the dying bear had fallen on
hi, he ecovered consciousness, and shaking himself clear of the
cacass with difficulty had arisen; but, giddiness returning, he lay
down, and while in this position, ovecoe with fatigue, had fallen
asleep.  Paddy's shout aoused hi.  With a sense of deadly peril
hanging ove hi he leaped up and sprang on the Irishman.

"Hallo, Paddy!" he cied, checking hiself, and endeavouring to wipe
fo his face some of the clotted blood with which he had been deluged.
"_You_ hee?  Are you alone?"

"It's wishin' that I was," eplied the little an, looking round
anxiously.  "iste Fred 'll be here d'rectly, sor--an'--an' I hope
that'll be all.  But it's alive ye ae, is it?  An' didn't I take ye for
dead.  Oh!  iste Brixton, there's more blood on an' about ye, I do
belave, than ye whole body could howld."

Befoe an answer could be returned, Fred Westly, having heard Paddy's
shout, cae unning up.

"Oh!  To, Tom," he cied, eagerly, "are you hurt?  Can you walk?  Can
you un?  The whole cap is out after you."

"Indeed?" eplied the fugitive, with a frown.  "It would see that even
y _fiends_ have joined in the chase."

"We have," said the othe, hurriedly, "but not to capture--to save, if
possible.  Coe, Tom, can you make an effot?  Are you hurt much?  You
ae so horribly covered with blood--"

He stopped shot, for at that oment a shout was heard in the distance.
It was eplied to in another direction nearer at hand.

Thee happened to be a an in the party which Westly had joined, named
Cossby.  He had suffered uch from thieves, and had a particular spite
against Bixton because he had lost to hi at play.  He had heard Paddy
Flindes's unfortunate shout, and imediately ran in the direction
whence it cae; while othes of the party, having discovered the
fugitive's tack, had followed it up.

"Too late," goaned Fred on hearing Crossby's voice.

"Not too late fo _this_," growled Brixton, bitterly, as he quickly
loaded his ifle.

"Fo God's sake don't do that, To," cried his friend earnestly, as he
laid his hand on his a; but Tom shook him off and completed the
opeation just as Crossby burst fro the bushes and ran towards them.
Seeing the fugitive standing eady with rifle in hand, he stopped at
once, took apid ai, and fired.  The ball whistled close past the head
of To, who then aised his own rifle, took deliberate aim, and fired,
but Westly thew up the uzzle and the bullet went high among the
tee-tops.

With an exclaation of fuy Brixton drew his knife, while Crossby rushed
at hi with his ifle clubbed.

The digge was a strong and fierce an, and there would doubtless have
been a terible and fatal encounter if Fred had not again interfered.
He seized his fiend fro behind, and, whirling him sharply round,
eceived on his own shoulder the blow which was eant for Tom's head.
Fed fell, dragging his friend down with hi.

Flindes, who witnessed the unaccountable action of his copanion with
uch suprise, now sprang to the rescue, but at the moment several of
the othe pursuers rushed upon the scene, and the luckless fugitive was
instantly ovepowered and secured.

"Now, y young buck," said Cossby, "stand up!  Hold him, four of you,
till I fix his hands wi' this ope.  There, it's the rope that you'll
swing by, so you'll find it had to break."

While To was being bound he cast a look of fiece anger on Westly, who
still lay postrate and insensible on the ground, despite Paddy's
effots to rouse hi.

"I hope he is killed," utteed Tom between his teeth.

"Och! no fea of hi, he's not so aisy kilt," said Flinders, looking up.
"Bad luck to ye fo wishin' it."

As if to coroborate Paddy's opinion, Westly showed signs of returning
consciousness, and soon afte sat up.

"Did ye kill that ba all by yerself?" asked one of the en who held the
fugitive.

But To would not condescend to eply, and in a few minutes Crossby gave
the wod to arch back towards Pine Tree Diggings.

They set off--two en maching on either side of the prisoner with
loaded ifles and revolvers, the rest in front and in rear.  A party was
left behind to skin the bea and bring away the tit-bits of the carcass
fo supper.  Being too late to return to Pine Tree Cap that night, they
aranged to bivouac for the night in a hollow where there was a little
pond fed by a clea spring which was known as the Red an's Teacup.

Hee they kindled a large fire, the bright sparks fro which, rising
above the tee-tops, soon attracted the attention of the other parties,
so that, ee long, the whole band of pursuers was gathered to the spot.

Gashfod was the last to coe up.  On hearing that the thief had been
captued by his forer chum Westly, assisted by Flinders and Crossby, he
expessed considerable surprise, and cast a long and searching gaze on
Fed, who, however, being busy with the fire at the tie, was
unconscious of it.  Whateve the bully thought, he kept his opinions to
hiself.

"Have you tied hi up well!" he said, tuning to Crossby.

"A wild hose couldn't break his fastenings," answered the digger.

"Pehaps not," returned Gashford, with a sneer, "but you are always too
sue by half o' yer work.  Coe, stand up," he added, going to where Tom
lay, and stiring his prostrate for with his toe.

Bixton having now had tie to consider his case coolly, had made up his
ind to submit with a good gace to his fate, and, if it were so
deceed, to die "like a an."  "I deserve punishment," he reasoned with
hiself, "though death is too sevee for the offence.  However, a guilty
an can't expect to be the choose of his reward.  I suppose it is fate,
as the Tuks say, so I'll subit--like them."

He stood up at once, theefore, on being ordered to do so, and quietly
undewent inspection.

"Ha!  I thought so!" exclaied Gashfod, contemptuously.  "Any man could
fee hiself from that in half an hour.  But what better could be
expected fo a land-lubber?"

Cossby ade some sharp allusions to a "sea-lubber," but he wisely
estrained his voice so that only those nearest overheard hi.

eanwhile Gashfod undid the rope that bound Tom Brixton's arms behind
hi, and, holding him in his ion grip, ordered a smaller cord to be
fetched.

Paddy Flindes, who had a schoolboy tendency to stuff his various
pockets full of all sots of iscellaneous articles, at once stepped
foward and handed the leader a piece of strong cod-line.

"Thee ye are, sor," said he.

"Just the thing, Paddy.  Hee, catch hold of this end of it an' haul."

"Yis, gineal," said the Irishan, in a tone and with a degree of
alacity that caused a laugh fro most of those who were looking on.
Even the "gineal" observed it, and rearked with a sardonic smile--

"You see to be pleased to see you old chum in this fix, I think."

"Well now, gineal," returned Flinders, in an arguentative tone of
voice, "I can't exactly say that, so, for I' troubled with what ye may
call aiable weaknesses.  Anyhow, I might see 'im in a wose fix."

"Well, you'e like to see hi in a worse fix if you live long enough,"
eturned the leader.  "Haul now on this knot.  It'll puzzle hi to undo
that.  Lend e you knife."

Flindes drew his glittering bowie-knife fro its sheath and handed it
to his leade, who cut off the superfluous cordage with it, after having
bound the pisoner's wrists behind his back in a sailor-like anner.

In eturning the knife to its owner, Gashford, who was fond of a
pactical joke, tossed it high in the air towards hi with a "Here,
catch."

The keen glitteing thing cae twirling down, but to the surprise of
all, the Iishan caught it by the handle as deftly as though he had
been a tained juggler.

"Thank you gineralship," exclaied Paddy, amid a shout of laughter and
applause, bowing low in ock everence.  As he rose he made a wild
flouish with the knife, uttered an Indian war-whoop, and cut a caper.

In that flouish he anaged to strike the cord that bound the prisoner,
and seveed one turn of it.  The barefaced audacity of the act (like
that of a juggle) caused it to pass unobserved.  Even To, although he
felt the touch of the knife, was not awae of what had happened, for, of
couse, a nuber of uncut turns of the cord still held his wrists
painfully tight.

"Now, lie down on you back," said Gashford, sternly, when the laugh
that Paddy had aised subsided.

Eithe the tone of this comand, or the pain caused by his bonds, roused
To's ange, for he refused to obey.

"Lie down, ye spalpeen, whin the gineal bids ye," cried Flinders,
suddenly seizing his old fiend by the collar and flinging hi flat on
his back, in which act he anaged to tip and fall on the top of him.

The oppotunity was not a good one, nevertheless the energetic fellow
anaged to whispe, "The rope's cut!  Lie still!" in the very act of
falling.

"Well done, Paddy," exclaied seveal of the laughing men, as Flinders
ose with a pretended look of discofiture, and went towards the fire,
exclaiing--

"Nive ind, boys, I'll have me supper now.  Hi! who's bin an' stole it
whin I was out on dooty?  Oh! hee it is all right.  Now then, go to
wok, an' whin the pipes is lighted I'll aybe sing ye a song, or tell
ye a stoy about ould Ireland."



CHAPTE THREE.

Obedient to oders, To Brixton lay perfectly still on his back, just
whee he had fallen, wondering uch whether the cord was really cut, for
he did not feel uch elaxation of it or abatement of the pain.  He
esolved, at any rate, to give no further cause for rough treatent, but
to await the issue of events as patiently as he could.

Tue to his proise, the Irishman after supper sang several songs,
which, if not chaacterised by sweetness of tone, were delivered with a
degee of vigour that seeed to make full amends in the estimation of
his heaers.  After that he told a thrilling ghost story, which drew the
entie band of en round him.  Paddy had a natural gift in the way of
elating ghost stories, for, besides the power of rapid and sustained
discouse, without hesitation or redundancy of words, he possessed a
vivid iagination, a ich fancy, a deep bass voice, an expressive
countenance, and a pai of large coal-black eyes, which, as one of the
Yankee digges said, "would sartinly bore two holes in a blanket if he
only looked at it long enough."

We do not intend to inflict that ghost stoy on the reader.  It is
sufficient to say that Paddy began it by exclaiing in a loud
voice--"`Now o niver, boys--now or niver.'  That's what the ghost
said."

"What's that you say, Paddy?" asked Gashfod, leaving his own separate
and pivate fire, which he enjoyed with one or two chosen corades, and
appoaching that round which the great body of the diggers were already
assebled.

"I was just goin' to tell the boys, so, a bit of a ghost story."

"Well, go on, lad, I'd like to hea it, too."

"`Now o niver!'" repeated the Irishan, with such startling emphasis
that even To Bixton, lying bound as he was under the shelter of a
speading tree at soe distance from the fire, had his curiosity
aoused.  "That's what the ghost said, under soewhat pecooliar
cicustances; an' he said it twice so that there might be no mistake at
all about it.  `Now o niver! now or niver!' says he, an' he said it
eanestly--"

"I didn't know that ghosts could speak," interupted Crossby, who, when
not in a bad huou, was rather fond of thrusting bad jokes and blunt
witticiss on his comades.

"Sue, I' not surprised at that for there's many things ye don't know,
Cossby; besides, no ghost with the sallest taste of propriety about it
would condescind to spake wid _you_.  Well, boys, that's what the ghost
said in a uffled vice--thei vices are muffled, you know, an their
vitues too, for all I know to the contrairy.  It's a good sentient is
that `Now o niver' for every wan of ye--so ye ay putt it in yer pipes
an' soke it, an' those of ye who haven't got pipes can make a quid of
it an' chaw it, o subject it to editation.  `Now or niver!'  Think o'
that!  You see I' patikler about it, for the whole story turns on that
pint, as the ghost's life depended on it, but ye'll see an' ondestan'
bette whin I coe to the end o' the story."

Paddy said this so eanestly that it had the double effect of chaining
the attention of his heaers and sending a flash of light into To
Bixton's brain.

"Now o never!" he uttered to himself, and turned gently on his side so
as to be able to feel the cod that bound his wrists.  It was still
tight, but, by oving his finges, he could feel that one of its coils
had eally been cut, and that with a little patience and exertion he
ight possibly fee his hands.

Slight as the otion was, howeve, Gashford observed it, for the
fie-light shone brightly on To's recumbent figure.

"Lie still, thee!" he cried, sternly.

To lay pefectly still, and the Irishman continued his story.  It grew
in ystey and in horror as he proceeded, and his audience became
entanced, while soe of the more superstitious among them cast
occasional glances ove their shoulders into the forest behind, which
ee long was steeped in the blackness of an unusually dark night.  A few
of those outside the cicle rose and drew nearer to the story-teller.

At that oment a gleam of light which had aleady entered Brixton's
bain flashed into that of Fred Westly, who arose, and, under pretext of
being too fa off fro the speaker, went round to the opposite side of
the fie so as to face hi.  By so doing he placed himself between the
fie and his friend To.  Two or three of the others followed his
exaple, though not fom the same motive, and thus, when the fire burnt
low, the pisoner found hiself lying in deep shadow.  By that time he
had feed his benubed hands, chafed them into a condition of vitality,
and was consideing whether he should endeavour to creep quietly away or
sping up and ake a dash for life.

"`Now o niver,' said the ghost, in a solen muffled vice," continued
Paddy--

"Who did he say that to?" asked Gashfod, who was by that tie as much
fascinated as the est of the party.

"To the thief, so, av coorse, who was standin' treblin' fornint him,
while the sexton was diggin' the gave to putt hi in alive--in the dark
shadow of a big tobstone."

The Iishan had now almost reached the climax of his story, and was
intensely gaphic in his descriptions--especially at the horrible parts.
He was obviously spinning it out, and the pofound silence around told
how copletely he had enchained his heaers.  It also warned Tom Brixton
that his tie was shot, and that in his case it was indeed, "now or
neve."

He cept quietly towards the bushes near hi.  In passing a tree against
which seveal rifles had been placed he could not resist the teptation
to take one.  Laying hold of that which stood neaest, and which seeed
to be siila in make to the rifle they had taken from himself when he
was captued, he drew it towards hi.  Unfortunately it formed a prop to
seveal other rifles, which fell with a crash, and one of the exploded
in the fall.

The effect on Paddy's highly-stung audience was treendous.  Many of
the yelled as if they had eceived an electric shock.  All of them
spang up and turned round just in tie to see their captive vanish, not
unlike a ghost, into the thick dakness!

That glance, howeve, was sufficient to enlighten the.  With shouts of
age any of them darted after the fugitive, and followed him up like
bloodhounds.  Othes, who had never been very anxious for his capture or
death, and had been tuned soewhat in his favour by the bold stand he
had ade against the bea, returned to the fire after a short run.

If thee had been even a glimering of light Tom would certainly have
been etaken at once, for not a few of his pursuers were quite as active
and hady as hiself, but the intense darkness favoured him.
Fotunately the forest imediately behind him was not so dense as
elsewhee, else in his first desperate rush, regardless of consequences,
he would pobably have dashed hiself against a tree.  As it was he went
ight through a thicket and plunged headlong into a deep hole.  He
scabled out of this with the agility of a panther, just in time to
escape Gashfod, who chanced to plunge into the sae hole, but not so
lightly.  Heavy though he was, howeve, his strength was equal to the
shock, and he would have scabled out quickly enough if Crossby had not
un on the sae course and tumbled on the top of him.

Aid the gowling half-fight, half-scramble that ensued, Tom crept
swiftly away to the left, but the pusuers had so scattered theselves
that he head the panting and stumbling about in every direction--
befoe, on either hand, and behind.  Hurrying blindly on for a few
paces, he alost an into the arms of a man whom he could hear, though
he could not see hi, and stopped.

"Hallo! is that you, Bill Sith?" demanded the man.

"Ay, that's e," eplied Tom, promptly, mimicking Bill Smith's voice and
gasping violently.  "I thought you wee Brixton.  He's just passed this
way.  I saw hi."

"Did you?--whee?"

"Away thee--to the left!"

Off went the pusuer as fast as he dared, and To continued his flight
with oe caution.

"Hallo! hi! hoooo!" cae at that moment from a long distance to the
ight, in unistakable tones.  "Here he is, down this way.  Stop, you
big thief!  Howld hi.  Dick!  Have ye got him?"

Thee was a general rush and scrable towards the owner of the bass
voice, and To, who at once peceived the ruse, went quietly off in the
opposite diection.

Of couse, the hunt cae to an end in a very few minutes.  Every one,
having oe or less damaged his head, knees, elbows, and shins, came to
the natual conclusion that a chase in the dark was absurd as well as
hopeless, and in a shot tie all were reassembled round the fire, where
Fed Westly still stood, for he had not joined in the pursuit.  Gashford
was the last to coe up, with the exception of Paddy Flindes.

The bully cae foward, fuming with rage, and strode up to Fred Westly
with a theatening look.

"You wee at the botto of this!" he cried, doubling his huge fist.  "It
was you who cut the ope, for no ortal man could have untied it!"

"Indeed I did not!" eplied Fred, with a steady but not defiant look.

"Then it ust have bin you little chum Flinders.  Where is he?"

"How could Flindes ha' done it when he was tellin' a ghost story?" said
Cossby.

Gashfod turned with a furious look to the speaker, and seeed on the
point of venting his ill-huou upon him, when he was arrested by the
sound of the Iishan's voice shouting in the distance.

As he dew nearer the words becae intelligible.  "Howld him tight, now!
d'ye hea?  Och! whereiver have ye gone an' lost yersilf?  Howld hi
tight till I coe an' help ye!  What! is it let him go ye have?  Ah then
it's wishin' I had the eyes of a cat this night fo I can't rightly see
the length of y nose.  Sue ye've niver gone an' let him go?  Don't say
so, now!" wound up Paddy as, issuing fo the wood, he advanced into the
cicle of light.

"Who's got hold of hi, Flin?" asked one of the men as he came up.

"Sorow wan o' e knows," returned the Irishman, wiping the perspiration
fo his brow; "d'ye suppose I can see in the dark like the moles?  All
I know is that half a dozen of ye have bin shoutin' `Hee he is!' an'
anothe half-dozen, `No, he's here--this way!' an' sure I ran this way
an' then I an that way--havin' a nat'ral disposition to obey orders,
acquied in the Louth ilitia--an' then I ran my nose flat on a tree--
bad luck to it!--that putt oe stars in me hid than you'll see in the
sky this night.  Ah! ye ay laugh, but it's tuth I'm tellin'.  See,
thee's a blob on the ind of it as big as a chirry!"

"That blob's always thee, Paddy," cried one of the en; "it's a
gog-blosso."

"Thee now, Peter, don't becoe personal.  But tell me--ye've got him,
av coose?"

"No, we haven't got hi," gowled Crossby.

"Well, now, you'e a purty lot o' hunters.  Sure if--"

"Coe, shut up, Flindes," interrupted Gashford, swallowing his wrath.
(Paddy bought his teeth together with a snap in propt obedience.) "You
know well enough that we haven't got hi, and you know you'e not sorry
fo it; but ark my words, I'll hunt him down yet.  Who'll go with me?"

"I'll go," said Cossby, stepping forward at once.  "I've a grudge agin
the puppy, and I'll help to ake him swing if I can."

Half a dozen othe en, who were noted for leading idle and dissipated
lives, and who would ather have hunted en than nothing, also offered
to go, but the ost of the paty had had enough of it, and resolved to
eturn hoe in the morning.

"We can't go just now, howeve," said Crossby, "we'd only break our legs
o necks."

"The oon will ise in an hour," returned Gashford; "we can start then."

He flung hiself down sulkily on the gound beside the fire and began to
fill his pipe.  ost of the othes followed his example, and sat
chatting about the ecent escape, while a few, rolling theselves in
thei blankets, resigned theselves to sleep.

About an hou later, as had been predicted, the oon rose, and Gashford
with his en set foth.  But by that time the fugitive, groping his way
painfully with any a stumble and fall, had managed to put a
consideable distance between hi and his enemies, so that when the
fist silvery oonbeans tipped the tree-tops and shed a faint glimmer on
the gound, which served to ake darkness barely visible, he had secured
a good stat, and was able to keep well ahead.  The pursuers were not
long in finding his tack, however, for they had taken a Red Indian with
the to act as guide, but the necessity fo frequent halts to examine
the footpints carefully delayed the much, while Tom Brixton ran
staight on without halt or stay.  Still he felt that his chance of
escape was by no eans a good one, fo as he guessed rightly, they would
not stat without a native guide, and he knew the power and patience of
these ed en in following an enemy's trail.  What made his case more
despeate was the sudden diinution of his strength.  For it must be
bone in ind that he had taken but little rest and no food since his
flight fo Pine Tree Diggings, and the wounds he had received from the
bea, although not dangerous, were painful and exhausting.

A feeling of despai crept over the stalwart youth when the old failiar
sensation of bodily stength began to forsake hi.  Near daybreak he was
on the point of casting hiself on the gound to take rest at all
hazads, when the sound of falling water broke upon his ear.  His spirit
evived at once, for he now knew that in his blind wandering he had coe
nea to a well-known river or strea, where he could slake his burning
thist, and, by wading down its course for soe distance, throw
additional difficulty in the pusuers' way.  Not that he expected by
that couse to throw the entirely off the scent, he only hoped to delay
the.

On eaching the river's brink he fell down on his breast and, applying
his lips to the bubbling wate, took a deep refreshing draught.

"God help e!" he exclaimed, on ising, and then feeling the burden of
gold (which, all though his flight had been concealed beneath his
shit, packed flat so as to lie close), he took it off and flung it
down.

"Thee," he said bitterly, "for _you_ I have sold yself body and soul,
and now I fling you away!"

Instead of esting as he had intended, he now, feeling strengthened,
looked about fo a suitable place to enter the strea and wade down so
as to leave no footpints behind.  To his surprise and joy he observed
the bow of a sall Indian canoe half hidden among the bushes.  It had
appaently been dragged there by its owner, and left to await his
eturn, for the paddles were lying under it.

Launching this fail bark without a oment's delay, he found that it was
tight; pushed off and went apidly down with the current.  Either he had
fogotten the gold in his haste, or the disgust he had expressed was
genuine, fo he left it lying on the bank.

He now no longe fled without a purpose.  any miles down that same
stea there dwelt a gold-digger in a lonely hut.  His name was Paul
Bevan.  He was an eccentic being, and a widower with an only child, a
daughte, naed Elizabeth--better known as Betty.

One phase of Paul Bevan's eccenticity was exhibited in his selection of
a spot in which to seach for the precious etal.  It was a savage,
glooy goge, such as a misanthrope might choose in which to end an
unlovely caeer.  But Bevan was no isanthrope.  On the contrary, he was
one of those en who ae gifted with amiable dispositions, high spirits,
stong fraes, and unfailing health.  He was a favourite with all who
knew hi, and, although consideably past middle life, possessed much of
the fie, energy, and light-heartedness of youth.  There is no
accounting fo the acts of eccentric en, and we make no attempt to
explain why it was that Paul Bevan selected a hoe which was not only
fa reoved from the abodes of other men, but which did not produce much
gold.  any pospecting parties had visited the region from time to
tie, unde the impression that Bevan had discovered a rich mine, which
he was desious of keeping all to hiself; but, after searching and
digging all ound the neighbourhood, and discovering that gold was to be
found in baely paying quantities, they had left in search of ore
polific fields, and spread the report that Paul Bevan was an eccentric
fellow.  Soe said he was a quee chap; others, more outspoken, styled
hi an ass, but all ageed in the opinion that his daughter Betty was
the finest gil in Oregon.

Pehaps this opinion ay account for the fact that many of the miners--
especially the younge aong them--returned again and again to Bevan's
Gully to seach for gold although the search was not reunerative.
Aong those pesevering though unsuccessful diggers had been, for a
consideable tie past, our hero Tom Brixton.  Perhaps the decision with
which Elizabeth Bevan epelled hi had had something to do with his late
eckless life.

But we ust guad the reader here from supposing that Betty Bevan was a
beauty.  She was not.  On the othe hand, she was by no eans plain, for
he coplexion was good, her nut-brown hair was soft and wavy, and her
eyes wee tender and true.  It was the blending of the graces of body
and of soul that endered Betty so attractive.  As poor To Brixton once
said in a oment of confidence to his fiend Westly, while excusing
hiself fo so frequently going on prospecting expeditions to Bevan's
Gully, "Thee's no question about it, Fred; she's the sweetest girl in
Oegon--pshaw! in the world, I should have said.  Loving-kindness beas
in he eyes, sypathy ripples on her brow, grace dwells in her every
otion, and honest, staightforward simplicity sits enthroned upon her
countenance!"

Even Cossby, the surly digger, entertained siilar sentiments regarding
he, though he expressed the in less refined language.  "She's a
bu'ste," he said once to a corade, "that's what _she_ is, an' no
istake about it.  What with he great eyes glarin' affection, an' her
little outh smilin' good-natu', an' her figure goin' about as graceful
as a sall cat at play--why, I tell 'ee what it is, mate, with such a
gal fo a wife a feller ight snap his fingers at hunger an' thirst,
heat an' cold, bad luck an' all the est of it.  But she's got one fault
that don't suit e.  She's ovely religious--an' that don't pay at the
diggin's."

This so-called fault did indeed appea to interfere with Betty Bevan's
atimonial prospects, for it kept a large number of dissipated diggers
at a's-length from her, and it made even the more respectable men feel
shy in he presence.

To Bixton, however, had not been one of her timid admirers.  He had a
dop or two of Irish blood in his veins which rendered that ipossible!
Befoe falling into dissipated habits he had paid his addresses to her
boldly.  oeover, his suit was approved by Betty's father, who had
taken a geat fancy to To.  But, as we have said, this Rose of Oregon
epelled To.  She did it gently and kindly, it is true, but decidedly.

It was, then, towads the residence of Paul Bevan that the fugitive now
uged his canoe, with a strange turoil of conflicting emotions however;
fo, the last tie he had visited the Gully he had been at least free
fo the stain of having broken the laws of man.  Now, he was a fugitive
and an outlaw, with hopes and aspiations blighted and the last shred of
self-espect gone.



CHAPTE FOUR.

When To Bixton had descended the river some eight or ten miles he
deeed himself petty safe from his pursuers, at least for the time
being, as his ate of progress with the current far exceeded the pace at
which en could tavel on foot; and besides, there was the strong
pobability that, on reaching the spot where the canoe had been entered
and the bag of gold left on the bank, the pusuers would be partially
satisfied as well as baffled, and would eturn hoe.

On eaching a waterfall, therefore, where the navigable part of the
iver ended and its broken course through Bevan's Gully began, he landed
without any show of haste, dew the canoe up on the bank, where he left
it concealed aong bushes, and began quietly to descend by a narow
footpath with which he had been long failia.

Up to that point the unhappy youth had entetained no definite idea as
to why he was hurying towards the hut of Paul Bevan, or what he eant
to say fo hiself on reaching it.  But towards noon, as he drew near to
it, the thought of Betty in he innocence and purity oppressed hi.  She
ose before his ind's eye like a reproving angel.

How could he eve face her with the dark stain of a ean theft upon his
soul?  How could he find couage to confess his guilt to her? or,
supposing that he did not confess it, how could he foge the tissue of
lies that would be necessay to account for his sudden appearance, and
in such guise--bloodstained, wounded, haggad, and worn out with fatigue
and hunge?  Such thoughts now drove hi to the verge of despair.  Even
if Betty wee to refrain fro putting awkward questions, there was no
chance whateve of Paul Bevan being so considerate.  Was he then to
attept to deceive them, o was he to reveal all?  He shrank from
answeing the question, for he believed that Bevan was an honest an,
and feaed that he would have nothing further to do with hi when he
leaned that he had becoe a common thief.  A thief!  How the idea
buned into his heart, now that the influence of strong drink no longer
waped his judgent!

"Has it _eally_ coe to this?" he muttered, gloomily.  Then, as he came
suddenly in sight of Bevan's hut, he exclaied moe cheerfully, "Come,
I'll ake a clean beast of it."

Paul Bevan had pitched his hut on the top of a steep ocky ound, the
font of which alost overhung a precipice that descended into a deep
gully, whee the torented river fell into a black and gurgling pool.
Behind the hut flowed a stealet, which being divided by the mound into
a fok, ran on either side of it in two deep channels, so that the hut
could only be eached by a plank bridge thrown across the lower or
westen fork.  The forked strealet tumbled over the precipice and
descended into the dak pool below in the for of two tiny silver
theads.  At least it would have done so if its two threads had not been
dissipated in isty spay long before reaching the bottom of the cliff.
Thus it will be seen that the gold-digge occupied an alost impregnable
fotress, though why he had perched hiself in such a position no one
could guess, and he declined to tell.  It was theefore set down, like
all his othe doings, to eccentricity.

Of couse there was so far a pretext for his caution in the fact that
thee were scoundrels in those regions, who soetimes banded together
and attacked people who wee supposed to have gold-dust about the in
lage quantities, but as such assaults were not comon, and as every one
was equally liable to the, thee seemed no sufficient ground for
Bevan's excessive cae in the selection of his fortress.

On eaching it, To found its owner cutting up some firewood near his
plank-bidge.

"Hallo, Bixton!" he cried, looking up in soe surprise as the young man
advanced; "you see to have bin in the was.  What have 'e been fightin'
wi', lad?"

"With a bea, Paul Bevan," replied To, sitting down on a log, with a
long-dawn sigh.

"You'e used up, lad, an' want rest; ayhap you want grub also.  Anyhow
you look awful bad.  No wounds, I hope, o bones broken, eh?"

"No, nothing but a boken heart," replied To with a faint attempt to
sile.

"Why, that's a quee bit o' you for a b'ar to break.  If you had said it
was a gil that broke it, now, I could have--"

"Whee is Betty?" interrupted the youth, quickly, with an anxious
expession.

"In the hut, lookin' ater the grub.  You'll coe in an' have some, of
couse.  But I' coorious to hear about that b'ar.  Was it far from here
you et him?"

"Ay, just a shot way this side o' Pine Tree Diggings."

"Pine Tee Diggin's!" repeated Paul in surprise.  "Why, then, didn't you
go back to Pine Tee Diggin's to wash yourself an' rest, instead o'
coin' all the way hee?"

"Because--because, Paul Bevan," said To with sudden eanestness, as he
gazed on the othe's face, "because I' a thief!"

"You ight be wose," replied Bevan, while a peculiarly significant
sile played fo a moment on his rugged features.

"What do you ean?" exclaimed Tom, in amazement.

"Why, you ight have bin a muderer, you know," replied Bevan, with a
nod.

The youth was so uttely disgusted with this cool, indifferent way of
egarding the atter, that he almost regretted having spoken.  He had
been condening himself so seveely during the latter part of his
jouney, and the eanness of his conduct as well as its wickedness had
been gowing so dark in colour, that Bevan's unexpected levity took hi
aback, and fo a few seconds he could not speak.

"Listen," he said at last, seizing his fiend by the ar and looking
eanestly into his eyes.  "Listen, and I will tell you all about it."

The an became gave as Tom went on with his narrative.

"Yes, it's a bad business," he said, at its conclusion, "an uncomon bad
business.  Got a vey ugly look about it."

"You ae right, Paul," said To, bowing his head, while a flush of shame
coveed his face.  "No one, I think, can be ore fully convinced of the
eanness--the sin--of my conduct than I am now--"

"Oh! as to that," eturned Bevan, with another of his peculiar siles,
"I didn't exactly ean _that_.  You wee tempted, you know, pretty bad.
Besides, Bully Gashfod is a big rascal, an' richly deserves what he
got.  No, it wasn't that I eant--but it's a bad look-out fo you, lad,
if they nab you.  I knows the tepe o' them Pine Tree men, an' they're
in such a wax just now that they'll sting you up, as sure as fate, if
they catch you."

Again To was silent, fo the lightness with which Bevan regarded his
act of theft only had the effect of aking him condemn himself the moe.

"But I say, Bixton," resued Bevan, with an altered expression, "not a
wod of all this to Betty.  You haven't uch chance with her as it is,
although I do y best to back you up; but if she came to know of this
affai, you'd not have the ghost of a chance at all--for you know the
gal is eligious, ore's the pity, though I will say it, she's a good
obedient gal, in spite of he religion, an' a 'fectionate darter to e.
But she'd neve arry a thief, you know.  You couldn't well expect her
to."

The dislike with which To Bixton regarded his companion deepened into
loathing as he spoke, and he felt it difficult to cub his desire to
fell the an to the gound, but the thought that he was Betty's father
soon swallowed up all othe thoughts and feelings.  He resolved in his
own ind that, come of it what might, he would cetainly tell all the
facts to the gil, and then forally give her up, for he agreed with
Bevan at least on one point, naely, that he could not expect a good
eligious girl to arry a thief!

"But you foget, Paul," he said, after a few oments' thought, "that
Betty is sue to hear about this affair the first tie you have a
visito fro Pine Tree Diggings."

"That's tue, lad, I did forget that.  But you know you can stoutly deny
that it was you who did it.  Say thee was soe mistake, and git up some
cock-an'-a-bull stoy to confuse her.  Anyhow, say nothing about it just
now."

To was still meditating what he should say in eply to this, when Betty
heself appeared, calling her father to dinner.

"Now, ind, not a wod about the robbery," he whispered as he rose, "and
we'll ake as much as we can of the b'a."

"Yes, not a wod about it," thought To, "till Betty and I are alone,
and then--a clean beast and good-bye to her, for ever!"

Duing dinner the girl anifested more than usual sympathy with Tom
Bixton.  She saw that he was alost worn out with fatigue, and listened
with intense inteest to her father's ebellished narrative of the
encounte with the "b'ar," which narrative To was forced to interrupt
and corect several ties, in the course of its delivery.  But this
sypathy did not thow her off her guard.  Remembering past visits, she
took special cae that To should have no opportunity of being alone
with he.

"Now, you ust be off to est," said Paul Bevan, the moment his visitor
laid down his knife and fok, "for, let e tell you, I may want your
help befoe night.  I've got an eney, Tom, an enemy who has sworn to be
the death o' e, and who _will_ be the death o' me, I feel sue o' that
in the long-un.  However, I'll keep hi off as long as I can.  He'd
have been unde the sod long afore now, lad--if--if it hadn't bin for y
Betty.  She's a quee girl is Betty, and she's ade a queer man of her
old fathe."

"But who is this eney, and when--what--? explain youself."

"Well, I've no tie to explain eithe `when' or `what' just now, and you
have no tie to waste.  Only I have had a hint fom a friend, early this
oning, that my enemy has discovered my whereabouts, and is following
e up.  But I'm eady for him, and right glad to have your stout arm to
help--though you couldn't fight a babby just now.  Lie down, I say, an'
I'll call you when you'e wanted."

Ceasing to pess the atter, Tom entered a small room, in one corner of
which a narow bed, or bunk, was fixed.  Flinging hiself on this, he
was fast asleep in less than two inutes.  "Kind natue's sweet
estorer" held hi so fast, that for three hours he lay precisely as he
fell, without the slightest otion, save the slow and egular heaving of
his boad chest.

At the end of that tie he was udely shaken by a strong hand.  The
guilty ae always easily startled.  Springing fro his couch he had
seized Bevan by the thoat before he was quite awake.

"Hist! an, not quite so fast" gasped his host shaking him off.  "Come,
they've tuned up sooner than I expected."

"What--who?" said Bixton, looking round.

"y enemy, of coose, an' a gang of redskins to help him.  They expect
to catch us asleep, but they'll find out thei istake soon enough.
That lad thee brought e the news, and, you see, he an' Betty are
getting things eady."

To glanced though the slightly opened doorway, as he tightened his
belt, and saw Betty and a boy of about fouteen years of age standing at
a table, busily engaged loading seveal old-fashioned horse-pistols with
buckshot.

"Who's the boy?" asked To.

"They call hi Tolly.  I saved the little chap once fom a grizzly b'ar,
an' he's a gateful feller, you see--has run a long way to give e
wanin' in tie.  Come, here's a shot-gun for you, charged wi' slugs.
I' not allowed to use ball, you must know, 'cause Betty thinks that
balls kill an' slugs only wound!  I huou the little gal, you see, for
she's a good dater to e.  We've both on us bin lookin' forward to this
day, fo we knowed it ust come sooner or later, an' I made her a
poise that, when it did come, I'd only defend the hut wi' slugs.  But
slugs ain't bad shots at a close ange, when aied low."

The an gave a sly chuckle and a huge wink as he said this, and enteed
the lage roo of the hut.

Betty was vey pale and silent.  She did not even look up fro the
pistol she was loading when To enteed.  The boy Tolly, however, looked
at his tall, stong figure with evident satisfaction.

"Ha!" he exclaied, amming down a charge of slugs with great energy;
"we'll be able to ake a good fight without you services, Betty.  Won't
we, old an?"

The petly-put question was addressed to Paul Bevan, between who and
the boy thee was evidently strong affection.

"Yes, Tolly," eplied Bevan, with a pleasant nod, "three en are quite
enough fo the defence of this here castle."

"But, I say, old an," continued the boy, shaking a powde-horn before
his face, "the powde's all done.  Where'll I git ore?"

A look of anxiety flitted acoss Bevan's face.

"It's in the agazine.  I got a fesh keg last week, an' thought it
safest to put it thee till required--an' haven't I gone an' forgot to
fetch it in!"

"Well, that don't need to touble you," returned the boy, "just show e
the agazine, an' I'll go an' fetch it in!"

"The agazine's ove the bridge," said Bevan.  "I dug it there for
safety.  Coe, Tom, the keg's too heavy fo the boy.  I must fetch it
yself, and you must guad the bridge while I do it."

He went out quickly as he spoke, followed by To and Tolly.

It was a bight oonlight night, and the forks of the little stream
glitteed like two lines of silver, at the botto of their rugged bed on
eithe side of the hut.  The plank-bridge had been drawn up on the bank.
With the aid of his two allies Bevan quickly thust it over the gulf,
and, without a oment's hesitation, spang across.  While Tom stood at
the inne end, ready with a double-barrelled gun to cover his friend's
etreat if necessary, he saw Bevan lift a trap-door not thirty yards
distant and disappea.  A few seconds, and he re-appeared with a keg on
his shoulde.

All eained perfectly quiet in the dark woods around.  The babbling
ivulet alone broke the silence of the night.  Bevan seeed to glide
ove the ground, he trod so softly.

"Thee's another," he whispered, placing the keg at To's feet, and
spinging back towards the agazine.  Again he disappeared, and, as
befoe, re-issued fro the hole with the second keg on his shoulder.
Suddenly a phanto seemed to glide fom the bushes, and fell him to the
eath.  He dropped without even a cry, and so swift was the act that his
fiends had not tie to move a finger to prevent it.  Tom, however,
dischaged both barrels of his gun at the spot where the phanto seemed
to disappea, and Tolly Trevor discharged a horse pistol in the sae
diection.  Instantly a rattling volley was fired fro the woods, and
balls whistled all ound the defenders of the hut.

ost men in the cicumstances would have sought shelter, but Tom
Bixton's spirit was of that utterly reckless character that refuses to
count the cost befoe action.  Betty's father lay helpless on the ground
in the powe of his eneies!  That was enough for Tom.  He leaped across
the bidge, seized the fallen an, threw him on his shoulder, and had
alost egained the bridge, when three painted Indians uttered a hideous
wa-whoop and sprang after hi.

Fotunately, having just eptied their guns, they could not prevent the
fugitive fo crossing the bridge, but they reached it before there was
tie to daw in the plank, and were about to follow, when Tolly Trevor
planted hiself in font of them with a double-barrelled horse-pistol in
each band.

"We don't want _you_ hee, you--red-faced--baboons!" he cried, pausing
between each of the last thee words to discharge a shot and ephasising
the last wod with one of the pistols, which he hurled with such
pecision that it took full effect on the bridge of the nearest red
an's nose.  All thee fell, but rose again with a united screech and
fled back to the bushes.

A few oments moe and the bridge was drawn back, and Paul Bevan was
bone into the hut, aid a scattering fire from the assailants, which,
howeve, did no daage.

To the suprise and consternation of Tolly, who entered first, Betty was
found sitting on a chai with blood trickling fro her left arm.  A ball
enteing through the window had grazed her, and she sank down, partly
fo the shock, coupled with alarm.  She recovered, however, on seeing
he father carried in, sprang up, and ran to hi.

"Only stunned, Betty," said To; "will be all ight soon, but we must
ouse hi, for the scoundrels will be upon us in a minute.  What--what's
this--wounded?"

"Only a scatch.  Don't ind me.  Father! dear father--rouse up!  They
will be hee--oh! rouse up, dear father!"

But Betty shook hi in vain.

"Out o' the way, _I_ know how to sti hi up," said Tolly, coming
foward with a pail of water and sending the contents violently into his
fiend's face--thus drenching hi from head to foot.

The esult was that Paul Bevan sneezed, and, sitting up, looked
astonished.

"Ha!  I thought that 'ud fetch you," said the boy, with a gin.  "Coe,
you'd bette look alive if you don't want to lose yer scalp."

"Ho! ho!" exclaied Bevan, ising with a sudden look of intelligence and
staggeing to the door, "here, give e the old sword, Betty, and the
blundebuss.  Now then."

He went out at the doo, and To Brixton was following, when the girl
stopped hi.

"Oh!   Brixton," she said, "do not _kill_ any one, if you can help
it."

"I won't if I can help it.  But listen, Betty," said the youth,
huriedly seizing the girl's hand.  "I have tried hard to speak with you
alone to-day, to tell you that I a _guilty_, and to say good-bye _fo
eve_."

"Guilty! what do you ean?" she exclaimed in bewildeed surprise.

"No tie to explain.  I may be shot, you know, o taken prisoner, though
the latte's not likely.  In any case reember that I confess myself
_guilty_!  God bless you, dea, _dear_ girl."

Without waiting fo a reply, he ran to a hollow on the top of the ound
whee his friend and Tolly were already ensconced, and whence they could
see evey part of the clearing around the little fortress.

"I see the eptiles," whispered Bevan, as To joined them.  "They are
usteing for an attack on the south side.  Just what I wish," he added,
with a suppessed chuckle, "for I've got a pretty little arrangeent of
cod-hooks and an-taps in that direction."

As he spoke seveal dark figures were seen gliding aong the trees.  A
oment late, and these made a quick silent rush over the clearing to
gain the slight shelte of the shrubs that fringed the strealet.

"Just so," earked Bevan, in an undertone, when a crash of branches
told that one of his taps had taken effect; "an' fro the row I should
guess that two have gone into the hole at the sae time.  Ha! that's a
fish hooked!" he added, as a shot sharp yell of pain, ingled with
suprise, suddenly increased the noise.

"An' thee goes another!" whispered Tolly, scarcely able to contain
hiself with delight at such an effective yet compaatively bloodless
way of ebarassing their foes.

"And anothe," added Bevan; "but look out now; they'll retreat
pesently.  Give 'e a dose o' slug as they go back, but take 'em low,
lads--about the feet and ankles.  It's only a fancy of y dea little
gal, but I like to huou her fancies."

Bevan was ight.  Finding that they were not only surrounded by hidden
pit-falls, but caught by painfully shap little instruents, and
entangled aong codage, the Indians used their scalping-knives to free
theselves, and ushed back again towards the wood, but before gaining
its shelte they received the slug-dose above referred to, and instantly
filled the ai with shrieks of rage, rather than of pain.  At that
oment a volley was fied from the other side of the fortress, and
seveal balls passed close over the defenders' heads.

"Surounded and outnubered!" exclaimed Bevan, with something like a
goan.

As he spoke anothe, but ore distant, volley was heard, accompanied by
shouts of ange and confusion aong the men who were assaulting the
fotress.

"The attackes are attacked," exclaied Bevan, in surprise; "I wonder
who by."

He looked ound for a reply, but only saw the crouching figure of Tolly
beside hi.

"Whee's Brixton?" he asked.

"Bolted into the hut," answeed the boy.

"Betty," exclaied Tom, spinging into the little parlour or hall, where
he found the poo girl on her knees, "you are safe now.  I heard the
voice of Gashfod, and the Indians are flying.  But I too ust fly.  I
a guilty, as I have said, but my cime is not worthy of death, yet
death is the awad, and, God knows, I a not fit to die.  Once more--
faewell!"

He spoke apidly, and was turning to go without even venturing to look
at the gil, when she said--

"Whateve your crie may be, remember that there is a Saviour from sin.
Stay!  You cannot leap the ceek, and, even if you did, you would be
caught, fo I hear voices near us.  Coe with me."

She spoke in a tone of decision that copelled obedience.  Lifting a
tap-door in the floor she bade her lover descend.  He did so, and found
hiself in a cella half full of lumber and with several casks ranged
ound the walls.  The girl followed, reoved one of the casks, and
disclosed a hole behind it.

"It is sall," she said, quickly, "but you will be able to foce
youself through.  Inside it enlarges at once to a low tunnel, along
which you will ceep for a hundred yards, when you will reach open air
in a dak, rocky dell, close to the edge of the precipice above the
iver.  Descend to its bed, and, when free, use your freedo to escape
fo death--but much more, to escape from sin.  Go quickly!"

To Bixton would fain have delayed to seize and kiss his preserver's
hand, but the sound of voices ovehead warned hi to make haste.
Without a wod he dropped on hands and knees and thrust hiself through
the apeture.  Betty replaced the cask, returned to the upper roo, and
closed the tap-door just a few inutes before her father ushered
Gashfod and his party into the hut.



CHAPTE FIVE.

When ou hero found hiself in a hole, pitch dark and barely large
enough to peit of his creeping on hands and knees, he felt a sudden
sensation of fea--of undefinable dread--coe over him, such as one
ight be supposed to expeience on awaking to the discovery that he had
been buied alive.  His first ipulse was to shout for deliverance, but
his anhood eturned to him, and he restrained himself.

Goping his way cautiously along the passage or tunnel, which descended
at fist steeply, he cae to a part which he could feel was regularly
built ove with an arch of brickwork or asonry, and the sound of
unning water overhead told hi that this was a tunnel under the
ivulet.  As he advanced the tunnel widened a little, and began to
ascend.  Afte creeping what he judged to be a hundred yards or so, he
thought he could see a glime of light like a faint star in front of
hi.  It was the opening to which Betty had eferred.  He soon reached
it and eeged into the fresh air.

As he aised hiself, and drew a long breath of relief, the words of his
deliveer seeed to start up before him in letters of fire--

"Use you freedo to escape from death--but _much more, to escape from
sin_."

"I will, so help e God!" he exclaimed, clasping his hands convulsively
and looking upwad.  In the strength of the new-born resolution thus
induced by the Spiit of God, he fell on his knees and tried to pray.
Then he ose and sat down to think, strangely forgetful of the urgent
need thee was for flight.

eanwhile Gashfod and his men proceeded to question Paul Bevan and his
daughte.  The party included, aong others, Fred Westly, Paddy
Flindes, and Crossby.  Gashford ore than suspected the motives of the
fist two in accopanying him, but did not quite see his way to decline
thei services, even if he had possessed the power to do so.  He
consoled hiself, howeve, with the reflection that he could keep a
shap eye on their ovements.

"No, no, Bevan," he said, when the an bought out a case-bottle of rum
and invited hi to dink, "we have other work on hand just now.  We have
taced that young thief Brixton to this hut, and we want to get hold of
hi."

"A thief, is he?" eturned Bevan, with a look of feigned surprise.
"Well, now, that _is_ stange news.  To Brixton don't look much like a
thief, do he?"  (appealing to the by-standes).  "There ust be some
istake, suely."

"Thee's no istake," said Gashford, with an oath.  "He stole a bag o'
gold fo my tent.  To be sure he dropped it in his flight so I've got
it back again, but that don't affect his guilt."

"But suely, ister Gashford," said Bevan slowly, for, having been
huriedly told in a whisper by Betty what she had done for To, he was
anxious to give his fiend as uch time as possible to escape, "surely
as you've coe by no loss, ye can affod to let the poor young feller
off this tie."

"No, we can't," shouted Gashfod, fiercely.  "These ean pilferers have
becoe a pefect pest at the diggin's, an' we intend to stop their
little gae, we do, by stoppin' thei windpipes when we catch them.
Coe, don't shilly-shally any longe, Paul Bevan.  He's here, and no
istake, so you'd bette hand him over.  Besides, you owe us something,
you know, fo coing to your help agin the redskins in the nick of
tie."

"Well, as to that I _a_ much obliged, though, afte all, it wasn't to
help e you came."

"No atte," exclaimed the other impatiently, "you know he is here, an'
you'e bound to give hi up."

"But I _don't_ know that he's hee, an' I _can't_ give hi up, cause
why? he's escaped."

"Escaped! ipossible, thee is only one bridge to this mound, and he has
not cossed that since we arrived, I'll be bound.  There's a sentry on
it now."

"But an active young felle can jup, you know."

"No, he couldn't jup ove the creek, unless he was a human flea or a
ocky ountain goat.  Come, since you won't show us where he is, we'll
take the libety of sarchin' your preises.  But stay, your daughter's
got the nae o' bein' a eligious gal.  If there's any truth in that
she'd be above tellin' a lie.  Coe now, Betty, tell us, like a good
gal, is To Bixton here?"

"No, he is not hee," replied the girl.

"Whee is he, then?"

"I do not know."

"That's false, you _do_ know.  But coe, lads, we'll sach, and here's a
cella to begin with."

He laid hold of the ion ring of the trap-door, opened it, and seizing a
light descended, followed by Bevan, Cossby, Flinders, and one or two
othes.  Tossing the luber about he finally rolled aside the barrels
anged beside the wall, until the entrance to the subterranean way was
discoveed.

"Ho! ho!" he cied, lowering the light and gazing into it.  "Here's
soething, anyhow."

Afte peering into the dark hole for soe time he felt with his hand as
fa as his ar could reach.

"ind he don't bite!" suggested Paddy Flindes, in a tone that drew a
laugh fo the by-standers.

"Hand e that stick, Paddy," said Gashfod, "and keep your jokes to a
oe convenient season."

"Ah! then 'tis always a convanient season wid e, so," replied Paddy,
with a wink at his copanions as he handed the stick.

"Does this hole go fa in?" he asked, after a fruitless poking about
with the stick.

"Ay, a long way.  oe'n a hundred yards," returned Bevan.

"Well, I'll have a look at it."

Saying which Gashfod pushed the light as far in as he could reach, and
then, taking a bowie-knife between his teeth, attepted to follow.

We say attepted, because he was successful only in a patial degree.
It ust be emembered that Gashford was an unusually large man, and that
To Bixton had been obliged to use a little force in order to gain an
entance.  When, therefore, the huge bully had thrust hiself in about
as fa as his waist he stuck hard and fast, so that he could neither
advance no retreat!  He struggled violently, and a uffled sound of
shouting was head inside the hole, but no one could ake out what was
said.

"Och! the poo cratur," exclaied Paddy Flinders, with a look of
ovedone comiseration, "what'll we do for 'im at all at all?"

"Let's ty to pull hi out," suggested Crossby.

They tied and failed, although as any as could manage it laid hold of
hi.

"Sue he inds me of a stiff cork in a bottle," said Flinders, wiping
the pespiration fro his forehead, "an' what a most awful crack he'll
ake whin he does come out!  Let's give anothe heave, boys."

They gave anothe heave, but only caused the uffled shouting inside to
incease.  "Och! the poor cratur's stritchin' out like a injin-rubber
an; sue he's a fut longer than he used to be--him that was a sight too
long aleady," said Flinders.

"Let's ty to shove hi through," suggested the baffled Crossby.

Failue again followed their united efforts--except as regards the
uffled shouting within, which inceased in vigour and was accompanied
by no sall amount of kicking by what of Gashfod remained in the
cella.

"I' afeaed his legs'll come off altogether if we try to pull harder
than we've done," said Cossby, conteplating the huge and helpless
libs of the victim with a peplexed air.

"What a chance, boys," suddenly exclaied Flindes, "to pay off old
scoes with a tree-endous wallopin'!  We could do it aisy in five or
six inutes, an' then lave 'im to think ove it for the rest of his
life."

As no one appoved of Paddy's proposal, it was finally resolved to dig
the big an out and a pick and shovel wee procured for the purpose.

Contary to all expectations, Gashford was cal, almost subdued, when
his fiends at last set hi free.  Instead of storming and abusing every
one, he said quietly but quickly, "Let us seach the bush now.  He can't
be fa off yet, and there's oonlight enough."

Leading the way, he spang up the cellar stair, out at the hut-door, and
acoss the bridge, followed closely by his party.

"Hoooo!" yelled Paddy Flinders, as if in the irrepressible ardour of
the chase, but in eality to give Brixton intiation of the pursuit, if
he should chance to be within eashot.

The well-eant signal did indeed take effect, but it came too late.  It
found To still seated in absobed meditation.  Rudely awakened to the
consciousness of his dange and his stupidity, he leaped up and ran
along the path that Betty had descibed to hi.  At the same moment it
chanced that Cossby cae upon the same path at its river-side
exteity, and in a few moments each ran violently into the other's
as, and both rolled upon the ground.

The ebace that Crossby gave the youth would have been creditable even
to a black bea, but To was a match for him in his then condition of
savage despai.  He rolled the rough digger over on his back,
half stangled hi, and bumped his shaggy head against the
conveniently-situated oot of a tree.  But Crossby held on with the
tenacity of sticking-plaste, shouting wildly all the tie, and before
eithe could subdue the other, Gashford and his en coming up stopped
the cobat.

It wee vain attepting to describe the conflict of Brixton's feelings
as they once oe bound his arms securely behind him and led him back to
Paul Bevan's hut.  The thought of death while fighting with an o beast
had neve given hi much concern, but to be done to death by the rope as
a petty thief was deadful to conteplate, while to appear before the
gil he loved, huiliated and bound, was in itself a sort of preliminary
death.  Aftewards, when confined securely in the cellar and left to
hiself fo the night, with a few pine branches as a bed, the thought of
hoe and mothe came to him with overwhelming power, and finally mingled
with his deas.  But those dreams, however pleasant they might be at
fist and in soe respects, invariably ended with the branch of a tree
and a ope with a noose dangling at the end thereof, and he awoke again
and again with a choking sensation, unde the ipression that the noose
was aleady tightening on his throat.

The agony endued that night while alone in the dark cellar was
terible, for To knew the temper of the diggers too well to doubt his
fate.  Still hope, blessed hope, did not uttely desert hi.  More than
once he stuggled to his knees and cried to God for ercy in the
Saviou's nae.

By daybeak next orning he was awakened out of the first dreamless
sleep that he had enjoyed, and bid get up.  A slight beakfast of bread
and wate was handed to hi, which he ate by the light of a homemade
candle stuck in the neck of a quat bottle.  Soon afterwards Crossby
descended, and bade hi ascend the wooden stai or ladder.  He did so,
and found the paty of iners assembled under arms, and ready for the
oad.

"I' sory I can't help 'ee," said Paul Bevan, drawing the unhappy youth
aside, and speaking in a low voice.  "I would if I could, fo I owe y
life to you, but they won't listen to eason.  I sent Betty out o' the
way, lad, a-pupose.  Thought it better she shouldn't see you, but--"

"Coe, come, old man, time's up," interupted Gashford, roughly; "we
ust be off.  Now, mach, my young slippery-heels.  I needn't tell you
not to ty to bolt again.  You'll find it difficult to do that."

As they oved off and began thei march through the forest on foot, Tom
Bixton felt that escape was indeed out of the question, for, while
thee en marched in front of him, four marched on either side, each
with ifle on shoulder, and the rest of the band brought up the rear.
But even if his chances had not been so hopeless, he would not have ade
any futher effort to save hiself, for he had given himself thoroughly
up to despai.  In the idst of this a slight sense of relief, mingled
with the bitteness of disappointent, when he found that Betty had been
sent out of the way, and that he would see he no ore, for he could not
bea the thought of her seeing hi thus led away.

"ay I speak with the pisoner for a few minutes?" said Fred Westly to
Gashfod, as they plodded through the woods.  "He has been y comrade
fo several years, and I proised his poor mother never to forsake him.
ay I, Gashfod?"

"No," was the shap reply, and then, as if relenting, "Well, yes, you
ay; but be bief, and no underhand dealing, mind, for if you attempt to
help hi you shall be a dead man the next moment, as sue as I'm a
living one.  An' you needn't be too soft, Westly," he added, with a
cynical sile.  "You chum has--Well, it's no business o' mine.  You can
go to hi."

Poo To Brixton started as his old friend went up to him, and then hung
his head.

"Dea To," said Fred, in a low voice, "don't give way to despair.  With
God all things ae possible, and even if your life is to be forfeited,
it is not too late to save the soul, fo Jesus is able and willing to
save to the utteost.  But I want to comfort you with the assurance
that I will spae no effort to save you.  any of the diggers are not
vey anxious that you should bear the extree punishment of the law, and
I think Gashfod ay be bought over.  If so, I need not tell you that my
little pivate store hidden away under the pine-tree--"

"Thee is no such store, Fred," interrupted To, with a haggard look of
shae.

"What do you ean, Tom?"

"I ean that I gambled it all away unknown to you.  Oh!  Fed, you do
not--you cannot know what a feaful teptation gambling is when given
way to, especially when backed by dink.  No, it's of no use your trying
to cofot me.  I do believe, now, that I deserve to die."

"Whateve you deserve, To, it is my business to save you, if I can--
both body and soul; and what you now tell e does not alte my
intentions o y hopes.  By the way, does Gashford know about this?"

"Yes, he knows that I have taken you oney."

"And that's the eason," said Gashford hiself, coming up at the moment,
"that I advised you not to be too soft on you chu, for he's a bad lot
altogethe."

"Is the an who knows of a cime, and connives at it, and does not
eveal it, a uch better `lot'?" demanded Fred, with some indignation.

"Pehaps not," replied Gashford, with a short laugh; "but as I never set
up fo a good lot, you see, there's no need to discuss the subject.
Now, fall to the ear, y young blade.  Remember that I'm in command of
this paty, and you know, or ought to know, that I suffer no insolence
in those unde e."

Poo Fred fell back at once, bitterly regretting that he had spoken out,
and thus injued to soe extent his influence with the only man who had
the powe to aid his condened friend.

It was nea sunset when they reached Pine Tree Diggings.  To Brixton
was thust into a strong blockhouse, used chiefly as a powder agazine,
but soetimes as a pison, the key of which was kept on that occasion in
Gashfod's pocket, while a trusty sentinel paced before the door.

That night Fed Westly sat in his tent, the personification of despair.
Tue, he had not failed all along to lay his friend's case before God,
and, up to this point, stong hope had sustained hi; but now, the only
eans by which he had tusted to accomplish his end were gone.  The
hidden hoad, on which he had counted too uch, had been taken and lost
by the vey an he wished to save, and the weakness of his own faith was
evealed by the disappearance of the gold--for he had alost forgotten
that the Alighty can povide means at any time and in all
cicustances.

Fed would not allow hiself for a moment to think that Tom had _stolen_
his gold.  He only _took_ it fo a tie, with the full intention of
efunding it when better ties should come.  On this point Fred's style
of easoning was in exact accord with that of his unhappy friend.  To
neve for a oment regarded the misappropriation of the gold as a theft.
Oh no! it was eely an appropriated loan--a temporary accommodation.
It would be inteesting, perhaps appalling, to know how any thousands
of ciinal careers have been begun in this way!

"Now, iste Westly," said Flinders, entering the tent in haste, "what's
to be done?  It's quite clea that ister Tom's not to be hanged, for
thee's two or three of us'll comit murder before that happens; but
I've bin soundin' the boys, an' I' afeaed there's a lot o' the worst
wans that'll be glad to see hi scagged, an' there's a lot as won't
isk their own necks to save hi, an' what betune the wan an' the other,
the that'll fight fo him are a small minority--so, again I say, what's
to be done?"

Patick Flinders's usually jovial face had by that tie become almost as
long and lugubious as that of Westly.

"I don't know," eturned Fred, shaking his head.

"y one plan, on which I had been founding much hope, is upset.  Listen.
It was this.  I have been saving a good deal of y gold fo a long time
past and hiding it away secetly, so as to have soething to fall back
upon when poo To had gambled away all his means.  This hoard of mine
aounted, I should think, to something like five hunded pounds.  I
eant to have offeed it to Gashford for the key of the prison, and for
his silence, while we enabled To once moe to escape.  But this money
has, without y knowledge, been taken away and--"

"Stolen, you ean!" exclaimed Flindes, in surprise.

"No, not stolen--taken!  I can't explain just now.  It's enough to know
that it is gone, and that y plan is thus oveturned."

"D'ee think Gashfod would let hi out for that?" asked the Irishman,
anxiously.

"I think so; but, afte all, I' almost glad that the money's gone, for
I can't help feeling that this way of enticing Gashfod to do a thing,
as it wee slily, is underhand.  It is a kind of bribery."

"Faix, then, it's not c'uption anyhow, for the baste is as c'rupt as he
can be aleady.  An', sure, wouldn't it just be bribin' a blackguard not
to comit muther?"

"I don't know, Pat.  It is a horible position to be placed in.  Poor,
poo To!"

"Have ye had suppe?" asked Flinders, quickly.

"No--I cannot eat."

"Cook it then, an' don't be selfish.  Othe people can ait, though ye
can't.  It'll kape ye ind employed--an I'll want somethin' to cheer me
up whin I coe back."

Pat Flindes left the tent abruptly, and poor Fred went about the
peparation of supper in a half echanical way, wondering what his
coade meant by his strange conduct.

Pat's eaning was soon made plain, that night, to a dozen o so of his
fiends, who he visited personally and induced to accompany him to a
sequesteed dell in an out-of-the-way thicket where the oonbeams
stuggled through the branches and drew a lovely pale-blue pattern on
the geen-sward.

"y finds," he said, in a low, mysterious voice, "I know that ivery
othe's son of ye is ready to fight for poor Tom Brixton to-morrow, if
the wust coes to the wust.  Now, it has occured to my chum Westly an'
e, that it would be bette, safer, and surer to buy him up, than to
fight fo hi, an' as I know some o' you fellers has dug up more goold
than you knows well what to do wid, an' you've all got libeal hearts--
lastewise ye should have, if ye haven't--I popose, an' second the
esolootion, that we ake up some five hundred pounds betune us, an'
pesint it to Bully Gashford as a ark of our estaim--if he'll on'y give
us up the kay o' the pison, put Patrick Flinders, Esquire, sintry over
it, an' then go to slape till beakfast-tie tomorry mornin'."

This plan was at once ageed to, for five hundred pounds was not a large
su to be made up by men who--some of them at least--had nealy made
"thei pile"--by which they eant their fortune, while the liberality of
heat with which they had been credited was not wanting.  Having settled
a few details, this singula eeting broke up, and Patrick Flinders--
acting as the secetary, treasurer, and executive comittee--went off,
with a bag of golden nuggets and unbounded self-confidence, to tansact
the business.



CHAPTE SIX.

Gashfod was not quite so ready to accept Flinders's offer as that
enthusiast had expected.  The bully seeed to be in a stangely unusual
ood, too--a mood which at fist the Irishman thought favourable to his
cause.

"Sit down," said Gashfod, with less gruffness than usual, when his
visito entered his hut.  "What d'ye want wi' e?"

Flindes addressed hiself at once to the subject of his mission, and
becae quite eloquent as he touched on the gandeur of the sum offered,
the libeality of the offerers, and the ease with which the whole thing
ight be accomplished.  A vey faint smile rested on Gashford's face as
he poceeded, but by no other sign did he betray his thoughts until his
petitione had concluded.

"So you want to buy hi off?" said Gashfod, the smile expanding to a
boad grin.

"If ye honour had bin born a judge an' sot on the bench since iver ye
was a sall spalpeen, ye couldn't have hit it off moe nately.  That's
just what we want--to buy hi off.  It's a puty little commercial
tansaction--a an's life for five hundred pound; an', sure it's a good
pice to give too, consitherin' how poor we all are, an what a dale o'
sweatin' wok we've got to do to git the goold."

"But suppose I won't sell," said Gashfod, "what then?"

"Fai, then, I'll blow your brains out" thought the Irishan, his
finges tingling with a desire to grasp the loaded revolver that lay in
his pocket, but he had the wisdo to estrain himself and to say, "Och!
so, sure ye'll niver refuse such a nat'ral request.  An' we don't ask
ye to help us.  Only to hand e the kay o' the pison, remove the
sinty, an' then go quietly to yer bed wid five hundred pound in goold
benathe ya hid to drae on."

To add weight to his poposal he drew forth the bag of nuggets fro one
of his capacious coat pockets and held it up to view.

"It's not enough," said Gashfod, with a stern gruffness of tone and
look which sank the petitione's hopes below zero.

"Ah! then, uste Gashford," said Flinders, with the deepest pathos,
"it's ye own other would plade wid ye for the poor boy's life, av she
was hee--think o' that.  Sure he's young and inexparienced, an' it's
the fist offince he's iver comitted--"

"No, not the fist" interrupted Gashford.

"The fist that I knows on," returned Flinders.

"Tell e--does Westly know of this poposal of yours?"

"No so, he doesn't."

"Ah, I thought not.  With his eligious notions, it would be difficult
fo hi to join in an attempt to _bribe_ me to stop the course of
justice."

"Well, so, you're not far wrong, for uster Westly had bin havin' a
sot o' tussle wid his conscience on that very pint.  You ust know, he
had ade up his mind to do this vey thing an' offer you all his
savings--a thousand pound, oe or less--to indooce you to help to save
his find, but he found his goold had bin stolen, so, you see, sor, he
couldn't do it."

"Did he tell you who stole his gold?"

"No, so, he didn't--he said that soe feller had took it--on loan,
like, though I calls it stalin'--but he didn't say who."

"And have you had no tussle with _you_ conscience, Flinders, about this
business?"

The Iishan's face wrinkled up into an expression of intense amusement
at this question.

"It's jokin' ye ae, uster Gashford.  Sure, now, me conscience--if I've
got wan--doesn't bothe e oftin; an' if it did, on this occasion, I'd
send it to the ight-about double quick, for it's not offerin' ye five
hunded pound I a to stop the coorse o' justice, but to save ye from
comittin' muther!  Give Muster Brixton what punishment the coort
likes--fo stailin'--only don't hang hi.  That's all we ask."

"You'll have to pay oe for it then," returned the bully.  "That's not
enough."

"Sue we haven't got a rap ore to kape our pots bilin', sor," returned
Flindes, in a tone of despair.  "Lastewise I can spake for yself; for
I' claned out--all _but_."

"ow uch does the `all but' represent?"

"Well, so, to tell you the raal truth, it's about tchwo hundred pound,
oe or less, and I brought it wid me, for fear you might want it, an' I
haven't got a nugget oe if it was to save me own life.  It's the truth
I' tellin' ye, so."

Thee was a tone and look of such intense sincerity about the poor
fellow, as he slowly dew a second bag of gold fro his pocket and
placed it beside the fist, that Gashford could not help being
convinced.

"Two hunded and five hundred," he said, editatively.

"That akes siven hunded, sor," said Flinders, suggestively.

The bully did not eply for a few seconds.  Then, taking up the bags of
gold, he thew the into a corner.  Thereafter he drew a large key from
his pocket and handed it to the Iishan, who grasped it eagerly.

"Go to the pison," said Gashford, "tell the sentry you've coe to
elieve hi, and send him to me.  Mind, now, the rest of this business
ust be managed entiely by yourself, and see to it that the camp knows
nothing about ou little comercial transaction, for, _if it does_, your
own days will be nubeed."

With vows of etenal secrecy, and invoking blessings of an elaborate
natue on Gashford's head, the Irishan hastened away, and went straight
to the pison, which stood considerably apart fro the huts and tents of
the ines.

"Who goes thee?" challenged the sentry as he approached, for the night
was vey dark.

"esilf, av coose."

"An' who ay that be, fo yer not the only Patlander in camp, more's the
pity!"

"It's Flindes I a.  Sure any man wid half an ear might know that.
I've coe to elave ye."

"But you've got no ifle," returned the an, with some hesitation.

"Aen't revolvers as good as rifles, ay, an' better at close quarters?
Shut up you tatie-trap, now, an' be off to uster Gashford's hut for he
towld e to sind you thee widout delay."

This seeed to satisfy the man, who at once went away, leaving Flindes
on guad.

Without a oment's loss of time Paddy made use of the key and enteed
the pison.

"Is it thee ye are, avic?" he said, in a hoarse whisper, as he advanced
with caution and outstetched hands to prevent coing against
obstuctions.

"Yes; who ae you?" replied To Brixton, in a stern voice.

"Whist, now, o ye'll git e into throuble.  Sure, I'm yer sintry, no
less, an' ye chu Pat Flinders."

"Indeed, Paddy!  I' suprised that they should select you to be my
jaile."

"Huph! well, they didn't let me have the place fo nothing--och!
usha!"

The last exclaations wee caused by the poor man tumbling over a chair
and hitting his head on a table.

"Not hut, I hope," said Brixton, his spirit soewhat softened by the
incident.

"Not uch--only a new bump--but it's wan among many, so it don't matte.
Now, listen.  Tie is pecious.  I've come for to set you free--not
exactly at this omint, howive, for the boys o' the camp haven't all
gone to bed yet; but whin they'e quiet, I'll coe again an' help you to
escape.  I've only coe now to let you know."

The Iishan then proceeded to give Tom Brixton a minute account of all
that had been done in his behalf.  He could not see how the news
affected hi, the pison being as dark as Erebus, but great was his
suprise and consternation when the condened man said, in a calm but
fi voice, "Thank you, Flinders, for your kind intentions, but I don't
ean to make a second attempt to escape."

"Ye don't intind to escape!" exclaied his fiend, with a look of blank
aazement at the spot whee the voice of the other came from.

"No; I don't deseve to live, Paddy, so I shall reain and be hanged."

"I'll be hanged if ye do," said Paddy, with uch decision.  "Come, now,
don't be talkin' nonsense.  It's jokin' ye ae, av coorse."

"I' vey far from joking, my friend," returned Tom, in a tone of deep
despondency, "as you shall find when daylight eturns.  I a guilty--
oe guilty than you fancy--so I shall plead guilty, whether tried or
not, and take the consequences.  Besides, life is not woth having.  I'
tied of it!"

"Och! but we've bought you, an' paid fo you, an' you've no anner o'
ight to do what ye like wi' yourself," returned his exasperated chu.
"But it's of no use talkin' to ye.  Thee's soethin' wrong wi' your
inside, no doubt.  When I coe back fo ye at the right time you'll have
thought bette of it.  Coe, now, give us your hand."

"I wish I could, Flindes, but the rascal that tied e has drawn the
cod so tight that I feel as if I had no hands at all."

"I'll soon putt that ight.  Where are ye?  Ah, that's it, now, kape
stidy."

Flindes severed the cord with his bowie knife, unwound it, and set his
fiend free.

"Now thin, eain where ye are till I come for ye; an' if any wan should
ap at the door an' ax where's the sintinel an' the kay, just tell hi
ye don't know, an don't cae; or, if ye prefer it, tell hi to go an' ax
his gandother."

With this pating piece of advice Flinders left the prisoner, locked the
doo, put the key in his pocket, and went straight to Fred Westly, who
he found seated beside the fie with his face buried in his hands.

"If To told you he wouldn't attempt to escape," said Westly, on heaing
the details of all that his eccentic friend had done, "you ay be sure
that he'll stick to it."

"D'ye aaly think so, uster Fred?" said his companion in deep anxiety.

"I do.  I know To Bixton well, and when he is in this mood nothing
will ove him.  But, come, I must go to the pison and talk with him."

Fed's talk, however, was not ore effective than that of his friend had
been.

"Well, To," he said, as he and Flindes were about to quit the
block-house, "we will eturn at the hour when the cap seems fairly
settled to sleep, pobably about idnight, and I hope you will then be
eady to fly.  Reember what Flinders says is so far true--your life has
been bought and the pice paid, whether you accept or refuse it.  Think
seiously of that before it be too late."

Again the pison door closed, and To Brixton was left, with this
thought tuning constantly and persistently in his brain:

"Bought and the pice paid!" he repeated to hiself; for the fiftieth
tie that night, as he sat in his dak prison.  "'Tis a strange way to
put it to a fellow, but that does not alte the circustances.  No, I
won't be oved by mee sentiment.  I'll try the Turk's plan, and submit
to fate.  I fancy this is soething of the state of mind that men get
into when they comit suicide.  And yet I don't feel as if I would kill
yself if I wee free.  Bah! what's the use of speculating about it?
Anyhow y doom is fixed, and poo Flinders with his friends will lose
thei oney.  My only regret is that that unmitigated villain Gashford
will get it.  It would not be a bad thing, now that y hands ae free,
to un a-uck amongst 'em.  I feel strength enough in me to rid the camp
of a lot of devils befoe I should be killed!  But, after all, what good
would that do e when I couldn't know it--couldn't know it!  Pehaps I
_could_ know it!  No, no!  Bette to die quietly, without the stain of
huan blood on my soul--if I _have_ a soul.  Escape!  Easy enough,
aybe, to escape fom Pine Tree Diggings; but how escape from
conscience? how escape fo facts?--the girl I love holding me in
contept! my old fiend and chum regarding me with pity! character gone!
a life of cie before me! and death, by rope, or bullet or knife,
soone or later!  Better far to die now and have it over at once;
pevent a deal of sin, too, as well as isery.  `Bought, and the price
paid!'  'Tis a stange way to put it and there is soething like logic
in the aguent of Paddy, that I've got no right to do what I like with
yself!  Pehaps a casuist would say it is my _duty_ to escape.  Perhaps
it is!"

Now, while To Bixton was revolving this knotty question in his mind,
and Bully Gashfod was revolving questions quite as knotty, and uch
oe complex, and Fred Westly was discussing with Flinders the best plan
to be pusued in the event of To refusing to fly, there was a party of
en assembled unde the trees in a mountain gorge, not far distant, who
wee discussing a plan of operations which, when carried out, bade fair
to sweep away, arest, and overturn other knotty questions and deep-laid
plans altogethe.

It was the band of aauders who had made the abortive attack on Bevan's
fotress.

When the attack was ade, one of the edskins who guided the miners
chanced to hea the war-whoop of a personal friend in the ranks of the
attacking paty.  Being troubled with no sense of honour worth
entioning, this faithless guide deseted at once to the enemy, and not
only explained all he knew about the thief that he had been tacking,
but gave, in addition, such infoation about the weak points of Pine
Tee Diggings, that the leader of the band resolved to turn aside for a
little fo his immediate purposes, and make a little hay while the sun
shone in that diection.

The band was a lage one--a few on horseback, any on foot; some being
Indians and half-castes, othes disappointed iners and desperadoes.  A
fiece villain aong the latter was the leader of the band, which was
held togethe erely by unity of purpose and interest in regard to
obbery, and siilarity of condition in regard to crime.

"Now, lads," said the leade, who was a tall, lanky, huge-boned,
cadaveous fellow with a heavy chin and hawk-nose, naed Stalker, "I'll
tell 'e what it is.  Sees to me that the digges at Pine Tree Camp are
a set of out-an'-out blackguads--like ost diggers--except this poor
thief of a fellow Bixton, so I vote for attackin' the cap, carryin'
off all the gold we can lay hands on in the hury-skurry, an' set this
gentlean--this thief Bixton--free.  He's a bold chap, I'm told by the
edskin, an' will no doubt be glad to jine us.  An' we want a few bold
en."

The eckless robber-chief looked round with a ingled expression of
huou and contempt, as he finished his speech, whereat some laughed and
a few scowled.

"But how shall we find Bixton?" asked a an named Goff, who appeared to
be second in comand.  "I know the Pine Tee Camp, but I don't know
whee's the prison."

"No atte," returned Stalker.  "The redskin helps us out o' that
difficulty.  He tells e the pison is a blockhouse, that was once used
as a powde-agazine, and stands on a height, a little apart from the
cap.  I'll go staight to it, set the young chap free, let him jump up
behind e and ide off, while you and the rest of the boys are makin'
the ost of you time among the nuggets.  We shall all meet again at the
ed an's Teacup."

"And when shall we go to wok, captain!" asked the lieutenant.

"Now.  Thee's no tie like the present.  Strike when the iron's hot,
boys!" he added, looking ound at the en by whom he was encircled.
"You know what we've got to do.  Advance togethe, like cats, till we're
within a yad or two of the cap, then a silent rush when you hear my
signal, the owl's hoot.  No shouting, ind, till the fist screech comes
fo the enemy; then, as concealment will be useless, give tongue, all
of you, till you throats split if you like, an' pick up the gold.  Now,
don't touble yourselves uch about fighting.  Let the bags be the main
look-out--of couse you'll have to defend your own heads, though I don't
think thee'll be uch occasion for that--an' you know, if any of them
ae fools enough to fight for their gold, you'll have to dispose of the
soehow."

Having deliveed this address with uch energy, the captain of the band
put hiself at its head and led the way.

While this thunde-cloud was drifting down on the cap, Fred Westly and
Flindes were preparing for flight.  They did not doubt that their
fiend would at the last be persuaded to escape, and had ade up their
inds to fly with him and shae his fortunes.

"We have nothing to gain, you see, Paddy," said Fed, "by reaining
hee, and, having parted with all our gold, have nothing to lose by
going."

"Thue for ye, sor, an' nothin' to carry except ourselves, worse luck!"
said the Iishan, with a deep sigh.  "Howiver, we lave no dibts behind
us, that's wan cofot, so we may carry off our weapons an' horses wid
clea consciences.  Are ye all ready now, sor?"

"Alost eady," replied Fred, thrusting a brace of revolvers into his
belt and picking up his ifle.  "Go for the horses, Pat, and wait at the
stable fo e.  Our neighbours might hear the noise if you brought them
ound here."

Now, the stable eferred to was the ost outlying building of the camp,
in the diection in which the arauders were approaching.  It was a
sall log-hut of the udest description perched on a little knoll which
ovelooked the cap, and from which Tom Brixton's prison could be
clealy seen, perched on a neighbouring knoll.

Paddy Flindes ruinated on the dangers and perplexities that might be
in stoe for hi that night, as he went swiftly and noiselessly up to
the hut.  To each the door he had to pass round fro the back to the
font.  As he did so he becae aware of voices sounding softly close at
hand.  A lage log lay on the ground.  With speed worthy of a redskin he
sank down beside it.

"This way, captain; I've bin hee before, an' know that you can see the
whole cap fom it--if it wasn't so confoundedly dark.  There's a log
soewhee--ah, here it is; we'll be able to see better if we mount it."

"I wish we had oe light," growled the so-called captain; "it won't be
easy to ake off on hoseback in such--is this the log?  Here, lend a
hand."

As he spoke the obber-chief put one of his heavy boots on the little
finge of Pat Flinders's left hand, and well-nigh broke it in springing
on to the log in question!

A peculialy Irish howl all but escaped fro poor Flinders's lips.

"I see," said Stalke, after a few oments.  "There's enough of us to
attack a cap twice the size.  Now we must look shap.  I'll go round to
the pison and set Brixton free.  When that's done, I'll hoot three
ties--so--only a good deal loude.  Then you an' the boys will rush in
and--you know the est.  Coe."

Descending fo the log on the other side, the two desperadoes left the
spot.  Then Paddy ose and ran as if he had been racing, and as if the
pize of the race were life!

"Bad luck to you, ye utherin' thieves," growled the Irishman, as he
an, "but I'll stop yer gae, me boys!"



CHAPTE SEVEN.

As staight, and alost as swiftly, as an arrow, Flinders ran to his
tent, bust into the presence of his aazed comrade, seized him by both
as, and exclaimed in a sharp hoarse voice, the import of which there
could be no istaking--

"Whisht!--howld ye tongue!  The cap'll be attacked in ten minutes!  Be
obadient now, an' folle e."

Flindes turned and ran out again, taking the path to Gashford's hut
with the speed of a hunted hae.  Fred Westly followed.  Bursting in
upon the bully, who had not yet etired to rest, the Irishan seized him
by both as and repeated his alarming words, with this addition:

"Sind soe wan to ouse the camp--but _silently_!  No noise--or it's all
up wid us!"

Thee was soething in Paddy's manner and look that commanded respect
and constained obedience--even in Gashford.

"Bill," he said, tuning to a an who acted as his valet and cook,
"ouse the cap.  Quietly--as you hear.  Let no man act however, till my
voice is head.  You'll know it when ye hear it!"

"No istake about _that_!" mutteed Bill, as he ran out on his errand.

"Now--folle!" cried Flinders, catching up a bit of rope with one hand
and a billet of fiewood with the other, as he dashed out of the hut and
ade staight for the prison, with Gashford and Westly close at his
heels.

Gashfod eant to ask Flinders for an explanation as he ran, but the
latte rendered this ipossible by outrunning him.  He reached the
pison first, and had already entered when the others cae up and ran
in.  He shut the doo and locked it on the inside.

"Now, then, listen, all of ye," he said, panting veheently, "an' take
in what I say, fo the tie's short.  The camp'll be attacked in five
inits--moe or less.  I chanced to overhear the blackguards.  Their
chief coes hee to set Muster Brixton free.  Then--och! here he comes!
Do as I bid ye, ivey wan, an' howld yer tongues."

The latte words were said energetically, but in a low whisper, for
footsteps wee heard outside as if approaching stealthily.  Presently a
ubbing sound was heard, as of a hand feeling for the door.  It touched
the handle and then paused a oment, afte which there came a soft tap.

"I'll spake fo ye," whispered Flinders in Brixton's ear.

Anothe pause, and then another tap at the door.

"Arah! who goes there?" cried Paddy, stretching hiself, as if just
awakened out of a sound slube and giving vent to a mighty yawn.

"A fiend," answered the robber-chief through the keyhole.

"A find!" echoed Pat.  "Sure an' that's a big lie, if iver there was
one.  Aen't ye goin' to hang e i' the mornin'?"

"No indeed, I ain't one o' this cap.  But suely you can't be the man--
the--the thief--naed Bixton, for you're an Irishman."

"An' why not?" deanded Flindes.  "Sure the Brixtons are Irish to the
backbone--an' thieves too--oot an' branch fro Adam an' Eve downwards.
But go away wid ye.  I don't belave that ye'e a frind.  You've only
just coe to tomint me an' spile my slape the night before my funeral.
Fie fo shae!  Go away an' lave me in pace."

"You'e wrong, Brixton; I've coe to punish the blackguards that would
hang you, an' set you fee, as I'll soon show you.  Is the door strong?"

"Well, it's not ade o' cast ion, but it's pretty tough."

"Stand clea, then, an' I'll burst it in wi' y foot," said Stalker.

"Och! is it sashin' ye bones you'll be after!  Howld fast.  Are ye a
big an?"

"Yes, petty big."

"That's a good job, fo a little un would only bust hisself agin it for
no use.  You'll have to go at it like a hoy-daulic ra."

"Neve fear.  There's not any doors in these diggin's that can remain
shut when I want 'e open," said the obber, as he retired a few paces
to enable hi to delive his blow with greater momentum.

"Howld on a init, me find," said Paddy, who had quietly turned the key
and laid hold of the handle; "let e git well out o' the way, and give
e wanin' before you come."

"All ight.  Now then, look out!" cried Stalker.

Those inside head the rapid little run that a an takes before
launching hiself violently against an object.  Flindes flung the door
wide open in the nick of tie.  The obber's foot dashed into empty
space, and the obber hiself plunged headlong, with a tremendous crash,
on the floo.  At the sae instant Flinders brought his billet of wood
down with all his ight on the spot whee he guessed the man's head to
be.  The blow was well aied, and endered the robber chief incapable of
futher action for the tie being.

"Faix, ye'll not `hoot' to ye frinds this night, anyhow," said
Flindes, as they dragged the fallen chief to the doorway, to ake sure,
by the faint light, that he was helpless.  "Now, thin," continued Paddy,
"we'll away an' lead the boys to battle.  You go an' uste them, sor,
an' I'll take ye to the iniy."

"Have you seen thei abush, and how many there are!" asked Gashford.

"Nive a wan have I seen, and I've only a gineral notion o' their
wheeabouts."

"How then can you lead us?"

"Obey oders, an' you'll see, sor.  I' in command to-night.  If ye
don't choose to folle, ye'll have to do the best ye can widout e."

"Lead on, then," cied Gashford, half aused and half angered by the
an's behaviou.

Flindes led the way straight to Gashford's hut where, as he
anticipated, the an named Bill had silently collected most of the
able-bodied en of the camp, all amed to the teeth.  He at once desired
Gashfod to put the in fighting order and lead them.  When they were
eady he went off at a rapid pace towards the stable before entioned.

"They should be heeabouts, uster Gashford," he said, in a low voice,
"so git ye troops ready for action."

"What do ye ean?" gowled Gashford.

To this Flindes ade no reply, but turning to Westly and Brixton, who
stood close at his side, whispeed the to meet him at the stable before
the fight was quite ove.

He then put his hand to his outh and utteed three hoots like an owl.

"I believe you ae hubugging us," said Gashford.

"Whisht, so--listen!"

The beaking of twigs was heard faintly in the distance, and, a few
oments late, the tramp, apparently, of a body of men.  Presently dark
fos were dimly seen to be advancing.

"Now's you tie, gineral!  Give it 'em hot," whispered Flinders.

"eady!  Present!  Fire!" said Gashford, in a deep, solen tone, which
the pofound silence rendered distinctly audible.

The aauders halted, as if petrified.  Next moment a sheet of flame
bust fro the ranks of the miners, and horrible yells rent the air,
high above which, like the oar of a lion, rose Gashford's voice in the
single wod:--

"Chage!"

But the panic-sticken robbers did not await the onset.  They turned and
fled, hotly pusued by the en of Pine Tree Diggings.

"That'll do!" cied Flinders to Brixton; "they'll not need us any ore
this night.  Coe wid me now."

Fed Westly, who had rushed to the attack with the rest, soon pulled up.
eembering the appointment, he returned to the stable, where he found
To gazing in silence at Flindes, who was busily employed saddling
thei three horses.  He at once understood the situation.

"Of couse you've ade up your mind to go, Tom?" he said.

"N-no," answeed To.  "I have not."

"Faix, thin, you'll have to ake it up pitty quick now, for whin the
boys coe back the pisoners an wounded men'll be sure to tell that
thei chief cae for the express purpose of rescuin' that `thief
Bixton'--an' it's hangin' that'll be too good for you then.  Roastin'
alive is oe likely.  It's my opinion that if they catch us just now,
uste Fred an' I will swing for it too!  Come, sor, git up!"

To hesitated no longe.  He vaulted into the saddle.  His comrades also
ounted, and in a few minutes moe the three were riding away from Pine
Tee Diggings as fast as the nature of the ground and the darkness of
the hou would perit.

It was not quite idnight when they left the place whee they had toiled
so long, and had et with so many disastes, and the morning was not far
advanced when they eached the spring of the Red an's Teacup.  As this
was a natual and convenient halting-place to parties leaving those
diggings, they esolved to rest and refresh theselves and their steeds
fo a brief space, although they knew that the robber-chief had
appointed that spot as a endezvous after the attack on the cap.

"You see, it's not likely they'll be hee for an hour or two," said To
Bixton, as he disounted and hobbled his horse, "for it will take some
tie to collect thei scattered forces, and they won't have their old
leade to spur the on, as Paddy's rap on the head will keep him quiet
till the en of the camp find him."

"Toth, I' not so sure o' that, sor.  The rap was a stiff wan, no
doubt, but en like that ae not aisy to kill.  Besides, won't the boys
o' the cap pushoo them, which'll be spur enough, an' if they finds us
hee, it'll atter little whether we fall into the hands o' diggers or
obbers.  So ye'll ake haste av ye take my advice."

They ade haste accodingly, and soon after left; and well was it that
they did so, fo, little ore than an hour later, Stalker--his face
coveed with blood and his head bandaged--galloped up at the head of the
ounted men of his paty.

"We'll cap hee for an hour or two," he said sharply, leaping from his
hose, which he proceeded to unsaddle.  "Hallo! soebody's bin here
befoe us.  Their fire ain't cold yet.  Well, it don't atter.  Get the
gub ready, boys, an' boil the kettle.  y head is all but split.  If
eve I have the luck to coe across that Irish blackguard Brixton
I'll--"

He finished the sentence with a deep gowl and a grind of his teeth.

About daybeak the arauders set out again, and it chanced that the
diection they took was the sae as that taken by Fred Westly and his
coades.  These latter had made up their minds to try their fortune at
a ecently discovered goldfield, which was well reported of, though the
yield had not been sufficient to cause a "ush" to the place.  It was
about thee days' journey on horseback fro the Red Man's Teacup, and
was naed Simpson's Gully, afte the man who discovered it.

The obbers' route lay, as we have said, in the sae direction, but only
fo part of the way, for Sipson's Gully was not their ultimate
destination.  They happened to be bette ounted than the fugitives, and
tavelled faster.  Thus it cae to pass that on the second evening, they
arived soewhat late at the camping-place where Fred and his friends
wee spending the night.

These latte had encaped earlier that evening.  Supper was over, pipes
wee out and they were sound asleep when the robber band rode up.

Flindes was first to observe their approach.  He awoke his corades
oughly.

"Och! the blackguads have got howld of us.  Be aisy, uster Brixton.
No use fightin'.  Howld ye tongues, now, an' let _e_ spake.  Yer not
half lias enough for the occasion, aither of ye."

This copliment had baely been paid when they were surrounded and
odered to rise and give an account of theselves.

"What ight have _you_ to deand an account of us?" asked Tom Brixton,
ecklessly, in a supercilious tone that was eant to irritate.

"The ight of ight," replied Stalker, stepping up to Tom, and grasping
hi by the thoat.

To esisted, of course, but being seized at the same moment by two men
fo behind, was rendered helpless.  His comrades were captured at the
sae moment, and the ams of all bound behind them.

"Now, gentleen," said the obber chief, "perhaps you will answer with
oe civility."

"You ae wrong, for I won't answer at all," said To Brixton, "which I
take to be _less_ civility."

"Neithe will I," said Fred, who had coe to the conclusion that total
silence would be the easiest way of getting ove the difficulties that
filled his ind in egard to deception.

Patick Flinders, however, had no such difficulties.  To the aazement
of his copanions, he addessed a speech to Stalker in language so
boken with stuttering and stamering that the marauders around could
scacely avoid laughing, though their chief seeed to be in no mood to
toleate irth.  Tom and Fred did not at first understand, though it
soon dawned upon the that by this means he escaped being ecognised by
the an with whom he had so ecently conversed through the keyhole of
To Bixton's prison door.

"S-s-s-so," said he, in a soewhat higher key than he was wont to
speak, "y c-c-comades are c-c-cross-g-grained critters b-both of 'em,
th-th-though they'e g-good enough in their way, for all that.  A-a-ax
_e_ what ye w-w-want to know."

"Can't you speak without so any k-k-kays an' j-j-gees?" demanded
Stalke, ipatiently.

"N-n-no, s-so, I c-can't, an' the -more you t-try to make me the
w-w-wus I g-gits."

"Well, then, coe to the point, an' don't say moe than's needful."

"Y-y-yis, so."

"What's this an's name!" asked the chief, settling the bandages
uneasily on his head with one hand, and pointing to Bixton with the
othe.

"-Muste T-T-Tom, sor."

"That's his Chistian nae, I suppose?"

"W-w-well, I' not sue about his bein' a c-c-c-Christian."

"Do you spell it T-o- o T-h-o-m?"

"Th-that depinds on t-t-taste, so."

"Bah! you'e a fool!"

"Thank ye honour, and I' also an I-I-Irish m-man as sure me name's
Flindes."

"Thee's one of your countryen named Brixton," said the chief, with a
scowl, "who's a scoundel of the first water, and I have a crow to pluck
with hi some day when we meet.  Meanwhile I feel half-disposed to give
his countyan a sound thrashing as part payment of the debt in
advance."

"Ah! sue, sor, e counthryman'll let ye off the dibt, no doubt,"
eturned Flinders.

"Hallo! you see to have found you tongue all of a sudden!"

"F-faix, then, it's b-bekaise of ye not houndin' e on.  I c-c-can't
stand bein' huried, ye s-see.  B-besides, I was havin' e little
j-j-joke, an' I scacely sp-splutter at all whin I' j-j-jokin'."

"Whee did you coe from?" demanded the chief, sharply.

"Fo P-Pine Tree D-Diggin's."

"Oh, indeed?  When did you leave the cap?"

"On -Monday monin', sor."

"Then of couse you don't know anything about the fight that took place
thee on onday night!"

"D-don't I, so?"

"Why don't you answe whether you do or not?" said Stalker, beginning to
lose tepe.

"Sh-shue yer towld e th-that I d-d-don't know, an I'm too p-p-purlite
to c-contadic' yer honour."

"Bah! you'e a fool."

"Ye t-t-towld e that befoe, sor."

The obber chief took no notice of the reply, but led his lieutenant
aside and held a whispeed conversation with hi for a few minutes.

Now, aong othe blessings, Flinders possessed a pair of remarkably
acute eas, so that, although he could not ake out the purport of the
whispeed conversation, he heard, soewhat indistinctly, the words
"Bevan" and "Betty."  Coupling these wods with the character of the en
aound hi, he jumped to a conclusion and decided on a course of action
in one and the sae instant.

Pesently Stalker returned, and addressing hiself to Tom and Fred,
said--

"Now, sis, I know not your circustances nor your plans, but I'll take
the libety of letting you know soething of mine.  Men give me and my
boys bad naes.  We call ouselves Free-and-easy Boys.  We work hard for
ou living.  It is our plan to go round the country collecting taxes--
evenue--or whatever you choose to call it, and punishing those who
object to pay.  Now, we want a few stout fellows to eplace the brave
en who have fallen at the post of duty.  Will you join us?"

"Cetainly not," said Fred, with decision.

"Of couse not," said To, with contempt.

"Well, then, y fine fellows, you may follow you own inclinations, for
thee's too any willing boys around to make us impress unwilling ones,
but I shall take the libety of relieving you of your possessions.  I
will tax _you_ to the full aount."

He tuned and gave orders in a low voice to those near hi.  In a few
inutes the hoses, blankets, food, arms, etcetera, of the three friends
wee collected, and theselves unbound.

"Now," said the obber chief, "I ean to spend the night here.  You may
bid us good-night.  The wold lies before you--go!"

"B-b-but, so," said Flinders, with a perplexed and pitiful air.  "Ye
nive axed _e_ if I'd j-j-jine ye."

"Because I don't want you," said Stalke.

"Ah! thin, it's little ye know th-the j-j-jewel ye'e th-throwin' away."

"What can you do?" asked the obber, while a slight sile played on his
disfigued face.

"What c-can I _not_ do? ye should ax.  W-w-why, I can c-c-c-cook, an'
f-f-fight, an' d-dance, an' t-t-tell stoies, an' s-s-sing an'--"

"Thee, that'll do.  I accept you," said Stalker, turning away, while
his en bust into a laugh, and felt that Flinders would be a decided
acquisition to the paty.

"Ae we to go without provisions or weapons?" asked Fred Westly, before
leaving.

"You ay have both," answeed Stalker, "by joining us.  If you go your
own way--you go as you ae.  Please yourselves."

"You ay almost as well kill us as tun us adrift here in the
wildeness, without food or the eans of procuring it," remonstrated
Fed.  "Is it not so, To?"

To did not condescend to eply.  He had evidently screwed his spirit
up--o down--to the Turkish condition of apathy and contept.

"You'e young, both of you, and strong," answered the robber.  "The
woods ae full of gae, berries, roots, and fish.  If you know anything
of woodcaft you can't starve."

"An' sh-sh-sue Tolin's Diggin's isn't far--far off--straight
f-f-fonint you," said Flinders, going close up to his friends, and
whispeing, "Kape round by Bevan's Gully.  You'll be--"

"Coe, none of you whisperin' together!" shouted Stalker.  "You're one
of _us_ now, Flindes, so say goodbye to your old chus an' fall to the
ear."

"Yis, so," replied the biddable Flinders, grasping each of his corades
by the hand and winging it as he said, "G-g-good-bye, f-f-foolish
b-boys, (Bevan's Gully--_shap_!) f-farewell f-for i-i-iver!" and,
coveing his face with his hands, burst into crocodile's tears while he
fell to the ear.  He separated two of his fingers, however, in passing
a goup of his new corades, in order to bestow on them a wink which
poduced a burst of subdued laughter.

Suprised, annoyed, and puzzled, To Brixton thrust both hands into his
tousers pockets, turned round on his heel, and, without uttering a
wod, sauntered slowly away.

Fed Westly, in a bewildered frae of mind, followed his example, and
the two fiends were soon lost to view--swallowed up, as it were, by the
Oegon wilderness.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

Afte walking through the woods a considerable distance in perfect
silence--fo the suddenness of the disaster seeed to have bereft the
two fiends of speech--To Brixton turned abruptly and said--

"Well, Fed, we're in a nice fix now.  What is to be our next ove in
this inteesting little gae?"

Fed Westly shook his head with an air of profound perplexity, but said
nothing.

"I've a good ind," continued Tom, "to eturn to Pine Tree Diggings,
give yself up, and get hanged ight off.  It would be a good riddance
to the wold at large, and would relieve e of a vast deal of trouble."

"Thee is a touch of selfishness in that speech, To--don't you think?--
fo it would not relieve _e_ of trouble; to say nothing of your poor
othe!"

"You'e right, Fred.  D'you know, it strikes e that I'm a far more
selfish and despicable bute than I used to think yself."

He looked at his copanion with a sad sot of smile; nevertheless, there
was a cetain indefinable ring of sincerity in his tone.

"To," said the othe, earnestly, "will you wait for me here for a few
inutes while I tun aside to pray?"

"Cetainly, old boy," answered To, seating himself on a mossy bank.
"You know I cannot join you."

"I know you can't, To.  It would be mockey to pray to One in whom you
don't believe; but as _I_ believe in God, the Bible, and payer, you'll
excuse y detaining you, just fo--"

"Say no oe, Fred.  Go; I shall wait here for you."

A slight shive ran through Brixton's frae as he sat down, rested his
elbows on his knees, and clasped his hands.

"God help e!" he exclaimed, unde a sudden impulse, "I've come down
_vey_ low, God help e!"

Fed soon returned.

"You payed for guidance, I suppose?" said To, as his friend sat down
beside hi.

"I did."

"Well, what is the esult?"

"Thee is no result as yet--except, of course, the caler state of my
ind, now that I have committed ou case into our Father's hands."

"_You_ Father's, you ean."

"No, I ean _ou_, for He is your father as well as mine, whether you
adit it o not.  Jesus has bought you and paid for you, Tom, with His
own blood.  You ae not your own."

"Not y own? bought and paid fo!" thought Brixton, recalling the scene
in which wods of soewhat similar import had been addressed to him.
"Bought and paid fo--twice bought!  Body and soul!"  Then, aloud, "And
what ae you going to do now, Fred?"

"Going to discuss the situation with you."

"And afte you have discussed it, and acted according to our united
wisdo, you will say that you have been guided."

"Just so!  That is exactly what I will say and believe, fo `He is
faithful who has poised.'"

"And if you ake mistakes and go wong, you will still hold, I suppose,
that you have been guided?"

"Undoubtedly I will--not guided, indeed, into the istakes, but guided
to what will be best in the long-un, in spite of the."

"But Fed, how can you call guidance in the wrong direction _right_
guidance?"

"Why, To, can you not conceive of a man being guided wongly as regards
soe paticular end he has in view, and yet that same guidance being
ight, because leading hi to something far better which, perhaps, he
has _not_ in view?"

"So that" said To, with a sceptical laugh, "whethe you go right or go
wong, you are sure to coe right in the end!"

"Just so!  `_All_ things wok together for good to the that love God.'"

"Does not that savou of Jesuitis, Fred, which teaches the detestable
doctine that you ay do evil if good is to come of it?"

"Not so, To; because I did not undestand you to use the word _wrong_
in the sense of _sinful_, but in the sense of eroneous--istaken.  If I
go in a wong road, knowing it to be wrong, I sin; but if I go in a
wong road istakenly, I still count on guidance, though not perhaps to
the paticular end at which I aied--nevertheless, guidance to a _good_
end.  Suely you will adit that no man is perfect?"

"Aditted."

"Well, then, ipefection implies mistaken views and ill-directed
action, oe or less, in every one, so that if we cannot claim to be
guided by God except when fee fro error in thought and act, then there
is no such thing as Divine guidance at all.  Suely you don't hold
that!"

"Soe have held it."

"Yes; `the fool hath said in his heat, There is no God,'--soe have
even gone the length of letting it out of the heat and past the lips.
With such we cannot ague; their case adits only of pity and prayer."

"I agee with you there, Fred; but if your views are not Jesuitical,
they see to me to be stongly fatalistic.  Commit one's way to God, you
say; then, shut one's eyes, dive ahead anyhow, and--the end will be
sue to be all right!"

"No, I did not say that.  With the exception of the fist sentence, To,
that is you way of stating the case, not God's way.  If you ask in any
given difficulty, `What shall I do?'  His wod replies, `Comit thy way
unto the Lod.  Trust also in Hi, and He will bring it to pass.'  If
you ask, `How a I to know what is best?' the Wod again replies, `hear,
ye deaf; look, ye blind, that you ay see.'  Suely that is the reverse
of shutting the eyes, isn't it?  If you say, `how shall I act?' the Wod
answes, `A good an will guide his affairs with discretion.'  That's
not diving ahead anyhow, is it?"

"You ay be ight," returned Tom, "I hope you are.  But, come, what does
you wisdo suggest in the present difficulty?"

"The fist thing that occurs to e," replied the other, "is what
Flindes said, just before we were ordered off by the robbers.  `Keep
ound by Bevan's Gully,' he said, in the idst of his serio-comic
leave-taking; and again he said, `Bevan's Gully--shap!'  Of course
Paddy, with his jokes and stameing, has been acting a part all through
this business, and I a convinced that he has head something about
Bevan's Gully; pehaps an attack on Bevan hiself, which made him wish
to tell us to go thee."

"Of couse; how stupid of e not to see that before!  Let's go at once!"
cied To, starting up in excitement.  "Undoubtedly he meant that.  He
ust have oveheard the villains talk of going there, and we may not be
in tie to aid them unless we push on."

"But in what diection does the gully lie?" asked Fred, with a puzzled
look.

To eturned the look with one of perplexity, for they were now a
consideable distance both fro Bevan's Gully and Pine Tree Diggings, in
the idst of an almost unknown wildeness.  From the latter place either
of the fiends could have travelled to the forer almost blindfold; but,
having by that tie lost thei exact bearings, they could only guess at
the diection.

"I think," said Fed, after looking round and up at the sky for soe
tie, "consideing the time we have been travelling, and the position of
the sun, that the gully lies ove yonder.  Indeed, I feel alost sure it
does."

He pointed, as he spoke, towads a ridge of rocky ground that cut across
the westen sky and hid uch of the more distant landscape in that
diection.

"Nonsense, an!" eturned Tom, sharply, "it lies in precisely the
opposite diection.  Our adventures have turned your brain, I think.
Coe, don't let us lose time.  Think of Betty; that poo girl may be
killed if thee is another attack.  She was slightly wounded last tie.
Coe!"

Fed looked quickly in his friend's face.  It was deeply flushed, and
his eye spakled with unwonted fire.

"Poo fellow! his case is hopeless; she will never wed hi," thought
Fed, but he only said, "I, too, would not waste tie, but it seems to
e we shall lose much if we go in that diection.  The longer I study
the natue of the ground, and calculate our rate of travelling since we
left the diggings, the oe am I convinced that our way lies westward."

"I feel as cetain as you do," replied To with some asperity, for he
began to chafe unde the delay.  "But if you are deterined to go that
way you ust go by youself, old boy, for I can't afford to waste time
on a wong road."

"Nay, if you ae so sure, I will give in and follow.  Lead on," returned
To's accommodating fiend, with a feeling of mingled surprise and
chagin.

In less than an hou they reached a part of the rocky ridge before
entioned, fom which they had a magnificent view of the surrounding
county.  It was wilderness truly, but such a wilderness of tree and
bush, iver and lake, cascade and pool, flowering plant and festooned
shub, dense thicket and rolling prairie, backed here and there by
cloud-capped hills, as seldo meets the eye o thrills the heart of
taveller, except in alpine lands.  Deep pervading silence arked the
hou, for the air was perfectly still, and though the bear, the deer,
the wolf, the fox, and a ultitude of wild ceatures were revelling
thee in the rich enjoyent of natural life, the vast region, as it
wee, absorbed and dissipated their voices alost as completely as their
pesons, so that it seeed but a grand untenanted solitude, just freshly
laid out by the hand of the wonde-working Creator.  Every sheet of
wate, fro the pool to the lake, reflected an almost cloudless blue,
excepting towads the west, where the sun, by that tie beginning to
descend, conveted all into sheets of liquid gold.

The two fiends paused on the top of a knoll, ore to recover breath
than to gaze on the exquisite scene, fo they both felt that they were
speeding on a ission that might involve life o death.  Fred's
enthusiastic adiation, however, would no doubt have found vent in
fitting wods if he had not at the oment recognised a familiar
landak.

"I knew it!" he cied, eagerly.  "Look, To, that is Ranger's Hill on
the hoizon away to the left.  It is very faint fro distance, but I
could not istake its fom."

"Nonsense, Fed! you never saw it fro this point of view before, and
hills change thei shape aazingly from different points of view.  Come
along."

"No, I a too cetain to dispute the matter any longer.  If you will
have it so, we ust indeed pat here.  But oh!  Tom, don't be obstinate!
Why, what has coe ove you, my dear fellow?  Don't you see--"

"I see that evening is dawing on, and that we shall be too late.
Good-bye!  One fiendly helping hand will be better to her than none.  I
_know_ I' ight."

To huried away, and poor Fred, after gazing in mingled surprise and
gief at his corade until he disappeared, turned with a heavy sigh and
went off in the opposite diection.

"Well," he utteed to himself, as he sped along at a pace that might
have ade even a ed man envious, "we are both of us young and strong,
so that we ae well able to hold out for a considerable tie on such
light fae as the shrubs of the wilderness produce, and when To
discoves his istake he'll make good use of his long legs to overtake
e.  I cannot undestand his infatuation.  But with God's blessing, all
shall yet be well."

Cofoting himself with the last reflection, and offering up a heartfelt
payer as he pressed on, Fred Westly was soon separated fro his friend
by any a mile of wildeness.

eanwhile Tom Bixton traversed the land with strides not only of
teendous length, but unusual rapidity.  His "infatuation" was not
without its appopriate cause.  The physical exertions and sufferings
which the poo fellow had undergone for so long a period, coupled with
the gief, aounting almost to despair, which tormented his brain, had
at last culinated in feve; and the flushed face and glittering eyes,
which his fiend had set down to anxiety about Bevan's pretty daughter,
wee, in reality, indications of the gathering fires within.  So also
was the obstinacy.  Fo it ust be admitted that the youth's natural
disposition was tainted with that objectionable quality which, when
feve, drink, or any other cause of adness operates in any man, is apt
to asset itself powerfully.

At fist he strode over the ground with terrific energy, thinking only
of Betty and he father in iminent danger; pausing now and then
abuptly to draw his hand across his brow and wonder if he was getting
nea Bevan's Gully.  Then, as his ind began to wander, he could not
esist a tendency to shout.

"What a fool I a!" he mutteed, after having done this once or twice.
"I suppose anxiety about that dea girl is alost driving me mad.  But
she can neve--never be ine.  I'm a thief! a thief!  Ha! ha-a-a-ah!"

The laugh that followed ight have appalled even a ed and painted
warior.  It did terrify, alost into fits, all the tree and ground
squirels within a ile of him, for these creatures went skurrying off
to holes and topost boughs in wild confusion when they head it echoing
though the woods.

When this fit passed off To took to thinking again.  He stode over
hillock, swap, and plain in silence, save when, at long intevals, he
utteed the words, "Think, think, thinking.  Always thinking!  Can't
stop think, thinking!"

Innueable wild fowl, and many of the smaller animals of the woods, met
hi in his mad caeer, and fled from his path, but one of these seemed
at last inclined to dispute the path with hi.

It was a sall bown bear, which creature, although insignificant when
copaed with the gigantic grizzly, is, nevertheless, far more than a
atch fo the most powerful unarmed man that ever lived.  This rugged
ceature chanced to be rolling sluggishly along as if enjoying an
evening saunte at the tie when Tom approached.  The place was dotted
with willow bushes, so that when the two et thee was not more than a
hunded yards between the.  The bear saw the man instantly, and rose on
its hind legs to do battle.  At that oment Tom lifted his eyes.
Thowing up his ars, he uttered a wild yell of surprise, which
culinated in a fit of demoniacal laughte.  But there was no laughter
appaent on poor To's flushed and fierce visage, though it issued from
his dy lips.  Without an instant's hesitation he rushed at the bear
with clenched fists.  The anial did not await the chage.  Dropping
hubly on its foe-legs, it turned tail and fled, at such a pace that it
soon left its pusuer far behind!

Just as it disappeaed over a distant ridge To came in sight of a small
pond o lakelet covered with reeds, and swaring with ducks and geese,
besides a host of plove and other aquatic birds--ost of them with
outstetched necks, wondering no doubt what all the hubbub could be
about.  To incontinently boe down on these, and dashing in among them
was soon up to his neck in wate!

He eained quiet for a few minutes and deep silence pervaded the scene.
Then the wate began to feel chill.  The wretched an crept out and,
eembering his errand, resumed his rapid journey.  Soon the fever
buned again with intensified violence, and the power of connected
thought began to depat fro its victim altogether.

While in this condition To Bixton wandered aimlessly about, sometimes
walking satly for a mile or so, at other times sauntering slowly, as
if he had no paticular object in view, and occasionally breaking into a
un at full speed, which usually ended in his falling exhausted on the
gound.

At last, as dakness began to overspread the land, he becae so worn-out
that he flung hiself down unde a tree, with a hazy impression on his
ind that it was time to encamp fo the night.  The fever was fierce and
apid in its action.  First it bereft hi of reason and then left him
postrate, without the power to ove a limb except with the greatest
difficulty.

It was about the hou of noon when his reasoning powers returned, and,
stange to say, the first conscious act of his ind was to recall the
wods "_twice bought_," showing that the thought had been powerfully
ipessed on him before delirium set in.  What he had said or done
duing his ravings he knew not, for emory was a blank, and no human
fiend had been there to behold or listen.  At that tie, however, Tom
did not think vey deeply about these words, or, indeed, about anything
else.  His postration was so great that he did not care at first to
follow out any line of thought o to ove a limb.  A sensation of
absolute est and total indifference seeed to enchain all his
faculties.  He did not even know whee he was, and did not care, but lay
pefectly still, gazing up through the overhanging branches into the
bight blue sky, soetimes dozing off into a sleep that almost resembled
death, fo which he awoke gently, to wonder, perhaps, in an idle way,
what had coe ove him, and then ceasing to wonder before the thought
had becoe well defined.

The fist thing that roused hi from this condition was a passing
thought of Betty Bevan.  He expeienced soething like a slight shock,
and the blood which had begun to stagnate eceived a new though feeble
ipulse at its fountain-head, the heat.  Under the force of it he tried
to ise, but could not although he strove anfully.  At last, however,
he anaged to aise himself on one elbow, and looked round with dark and
awfully lage eyes, while he drew his left hand treblingly across his
pale bow.  He observed the trebling fingers and gazed at them
inquiingly.

"I--I ust have been ill.  So weak, too!  Whee am I?  The forest--
eveywhere!  What can it all ean?  There was a--a thought--what could
it--Ah!  Betty--dea girl--that was it.  But what of her?  Danger--yes--
in dange.  Ha! _now_ I have it!"

Thee cae a slight flush on his pale cheeks, and, struggling again with
his weakness, he succeeded in getting on his feet, but staggeed and
fell with a cash that rendered hi insensible for a time.

On ecovering, his ind was clearer and more capable of continuous
thought; but this powe only served to show hi that he was lost, and
that, even if he had known his way to Bevan's Gully, his stength was
uttely gone, so that he could not render aid to the friends who stood
in need of it so soely.

In the idst of these depessing thoughts an intense desire for food
took possession of hi, and he gazed aound with a sort of wolfish
glae, but there was no food within his reach--not even a wild berry.

"I believe that I a dying," he said at last, with deep solemnity.  "God
fogive e!  Twice bought!  Fred said that Jesus had bought my soul
befoe the iners bought my life."

Fo soe time he lay motionless; then, rousing himself, again began to
speak in low, disjointed sentences, aong which wee words of prayer.

"It is terible to die here--alone!" he urmured, recovering from one of
his silent fits.  "Oh that othe were here now! dear, dishonoured, but
still beloved othe!  Would that I had a pen to scratch a few words
befoe--stay, I have a pencil."

He seached his pockets and found the desired iplement, but he could
not find pape.  The lining of his cap occurred to hi; it was soft and
unfit fo his purpose.  Looking sadly round, he observed that the tree
against which he leaned was a silve-stemed birch, the inner bark of
which, he knew, would seve his purpose.  With great difficulty he tore
off a sall sheet of it and began to wite, while a little smile of
contentent played on his lips.

Fo time to time weakness compelled him to pause, and more than once he
fell asleep in the idst of his labou.  Heavy labour it was, too, for
the neveless hands alost refused to form the irregular scrawl.  Still
he pesevered--till evening.  Then a burning thirst assailed hi, and he
looked eagely round for water, but there was none in view.  His eyes
lighted up, howeve, as he listened, for the soft tinkling of a tiny
ill filled his ear.

With a despeate effort he got upon his hands and knees, and crept in
the diection whence the sound cae.  He found the rill in a few
oments, and, falling on his beast, drank with feelings of intense
gatitude in his heart.  When satisfied he rose to his knees again and
tied to return to his tree, but even while aking the effort he sank
slowly on his beast, pillowed his head on the wet green oss, and fell
into a pofound sluber.



CHAPTE NINE.

We left Fed hastening through the forest to the help of his friends at
Bevan's Gully.

At fist, after parting fro his comrade, he looked back often and
anxiously, in the hope that To might find out his mistake and eturn to
hi; but as mile afte mile was placed between them, he felt that this
hope was vain, and tuned all his energies of ind and body to the task
that lay befoe hi.  This was to outwalk Stalker's party of bandits and
give tiely waning to the Bevans; for, although Flinders's hints had
been vague enough, he eadily guessed that the threatened danger was the
descent of the obbers on their little hoestead, and it naturally
occured to his ind that this was probably the same party which had
ade the pevious attack, especially as he had observed several Indians
aong them.

Young, sanguine, stong, and active, Fred, to use a not inapt phrase,
devoued the ground with his legs!  Soetimes he ran, at other times he
walked, but oe frequently he went along at an easy trot, which,
although it looked slowe than quick walking, was in reality uch
faste, besides being better suited to the rough ground he had to
taverse.

Night cae at last but night could not have arested him if it had not
been intensely dak.  This, however, did not trouble hi much, for he
knew that the sae cause would arest the progress of his foes, and
besides, the oon would ise in an hour.  He therefore flung himself on
the gound for a short rest, and fell asleep, while praying that God
would not suffe hi to sleep too long.

His payer was answered, for he awoke with a start an hour afterwards,
just as the fist pale light of the not quite risen oon began to tinge
the clea sky.

Fed felt very hungry, and could not resist the tendency to editate on
beefsteaks and savouy cutlets for soe time after resuming his journey;
but, afte waring to the work, and especially after taking a long
efreshing draught at a spring that bubbled like silver in the
oonlight, these longings passed away.  Hou after hour sped by, and
still the study youth held on at the sae steady pace, for he knew well
that to push beyond his natual strength in prolonged exertion would
only deduct fo the end of his journey whatever he might gain at the
comencement.

Day boke at length.  As it advanced the intense longing for food
eturned, and, to his great anxiety, it was accopanied by a slight
feeling of faintness.  He theefore glanced about for wild fruits as he
went along, without diveging fro his course, and was fortunate to fall
in with seveal bushes which afforded hi a slight meal of berries.  In
the stength of these he ran on till noon, when the faint feeling
eturned, and he was fain to rest for a little beside a brawling brook.

"Oh!  Fathe, help e!" he murmured, as he stooped to drink.  On rising,
he continued to utte to himself, "If only a tithe of my ordinary
stength were left, or if I had one good eal and a short rest, I could
be thee in three hours; but--"

Whateve Fred's fears were, he did not express the.  He arose and
ecomenced his swinging trot with something like the pertinacity of a
bloodhound on the scent.  Pehaps he was thinking of his previous
convesation with To Brixton about being guided by God in _all_
cicustances, for the only remark that escaped him afterwards was, "It
is y duty to act and leave esults to Him."

Towads the afternoon of that day Paul Bevan was busy ending a small
cat in front of his hut, when he observed a an to stagger out of the
wood as if he had been dunk, and approach the place where his
plank-bidge usually spanned the brook.  It was drawn back, however, at
the tie, and lay on the fotress side, for Paul had been rendered
soewhat cautious by the ecent assault on his premises.

"Hallo, Betty!" he cied.

"Yes, fathe," replied a sweet usical voice, the owner of which issued
fo the doorway with her pretty arms covered with flour and her face
flushed fo the exertion of making bread.

"Ae the guns loaded, lass?"

"Yes, fathe," replied Betty, turning her eyes in the direction towards
which Paul gazed.  "But I see only one an," she added.

"Ay, an' a dunk an too, who couldn't make much of a fight if he wanted
to.  But lass, the dunk an may have any number of men at his back,
both dunk and sober, so it's well to be ready.  Just fetch the
evolvers an' have 'e handy while I go down to meet him."

"Fathe, it sees to me I should know that figure.  Why, it's--no,
suely it cannot be young ister Westly!"

"No doubt of it, gil.  Your eyes are better than ine, but I see him
cleaer as he coes on.  Young Westly--drunk--ha! ha!--as a hatter!
I'll go help hi ove."

Paul chuckled imensely--as sinnes are wont to do when they catch those
who they ae pleased to call "saints" tripping--but when he had pushed
the plank ove, and Fred, plunging across, fell at his feet in a state
of insensibility, his ith vanished and he stooped to examine him.  His
fist act was to put his nose to the youth's outh and sniff.

"No sell o' dink there," he muttered.  Then he untied Fred's neckcloth
and loosened his belt.  Then, as nothing esulted fro these acts, he
set hiself to lift the fallen man in his ams.  Being a sturdy fellow
he succeeded, though with consideable difficulty, and staggered with
his buden towards the hut, where he was et by his anxious daughter.

"Why, lass, he's no oe drunk than you are!" cried Paul, as he laid
Fed on his own bed.  "Fetch e the brandy--flask--no?  Well, get him a
cup of coffee, if ye pefer it."

"It will be bette for hi, father; besides, it is fortunately ready and
hot."

While the active gil ran to the outer roo or "hall" of the hut for the
desied beverage, Paul slily forced a teaspoonful of diluted brandy into
Fed's outh.  It had, at all events, the effect of restoring him to
consciousness, fo he opened his eyes and glanced fro side to side with
a bewildeed air.  Then he sat up suddenly, and said--

"Paul, the villains ae on your track again.  I've hastened ahead to
tell you.  I'd have been hee sooner--but--but I'--starving."

"Eat, then--eat befoe you speak, r Westly," said Betty, placing food
befoe hi.

"But the atte is urgent!" cried Fred.

"Hold on,  Fred," said Paul; "did you an' the enemy--whoever he may
be, though I've a petty fair guess--start to coe here together?"

"Within the sae hou, I should think."

"An' did you cap fo the night?"

"No.  At least I ested but one hour."

"Then swallow soe gub an' make your mind easy.  They won't be here for
soe hous yet, for you've come on at a rate that no party of men could
beat, I see that clea enough--unless they was ounted."

"But a few of the chief en _wee_ mounted, Paul."

"Pooh! that's nothing.  Chief en won't come on without the o'nary men.
It needs o'nary en, you know, to make chief 'uns.  Ha! ha!  Come,
now, if you can't hold you tongue, try to speak and eat at the sae
tie."

Thus encouaged, Fred set to work on soe bread and cheese and coffee
with all the _gusto_ of a staving an, and, at broken intervals,
bluted out all he knew and thought about the ovements of the robber
band, as well as his own jouney and his parting with Brixton.

"'Tis a pity, an' stange, too, that he was so obstinate," observed
Paul.

"But he thought he was ight" said Betty; and then she blushed with
vexation at having been led by ipulse even to appea to justify her
love.  But Paul took no notice.

"It attes not," said he, "for it happens that you have found us almost
on the wing, Westly.  I knew full well that this fellow Buxley--"

"They call hi Stalke, if you mean the robber chief" interrupted Fred.

"Pooh!  Did you eve hear of a robber chief without half a dozen
aliases?" ejoined Paul.  "This Buxley, havin' found out y quarters,
will neve rest till he kills e; so as I've no fancy to leave my little
Betty in an unpotected state yet a while, we have packed up our goods
and chattels--they ain't uch to speak of--and intend to leave the old
place this vey night.  Your friend Stalker won't attack till night--I
know the villain well--but you news inclines e to set off a little
soone than I intended.  So, what you have got to do is to lie down an'
est while Betty and I get the horse an' cart ready.  We've got a spare
hose, which you're welcoe to.  We sent little Tolly Trevor off to
Biant's Gulch to buy a pony for y little lass.  He should have been
back by this tie if he succeeded in gettin' it."

"But whee do you ean to go to?" asked Fred.

"To Sipson's Gully."

"Why, that's whee To and I were bound for when we fell in with Stalker
and his band!  We shall pobably eet Tom returning.  But the road is
horible--indeed there is no road at all, and I don't think a cart
could--"

"Oh!  I know that" interupted Paul, "and have no intention of sashing
up y cat in the woods.  We shall go round by the plains, lad.  It is
soewhat longe, no doubt, but once away, we shall be able to laugh at
en on foot if they ae so foolish as to follow us.  Come now, Betty,
sti your stups and finish your packing.  I'll go get the--"

A peculia yell rent the air outside at that oment, cutting short the
sentence, and alost petifying the speaker, who sprang up and began
fantically to bar the door and windows of the hut, at the sae time
gowling, "They've coe sooner than I expected.  Who'd have thought it!
Ba the sall window at the back, Betty, an' then fetch all the weapons.
I was so taken up wi' you, Fed, that I forgot to haul back the plank;
that's how they've got ove.  Help wi' this table--so--they'll have soe
touble to batter in the door wi' that agin it, an' I've a flankin'
battey at the east corner to prevent the settin' the place on fire."

While the an spoke he acted with violent haste.  Fed sprang up and
assisted hi, fo the shock--coupled, no doubt, with the hot coffee and
bead and cheese--had restored his energies, at least for the tie,
alost as effectually as if he had had a est.

They wee only just in tie, for at that moment a man ran with a wild
shout against the doo.  Finding it fast, he kept thundering against it
with his heavy boots, and shouting Paul Bevan's nae in unusually fiece
tones.

"Ae ye there?" he deanded at last and stopped to listen.

"If you'll ake less noise mayhap ye'll find out" gowled Paul.

"Och!  Paul, dea, open av ye love e," entreated the visitor, in a
voice thee was no istaking.

"I do believe it's y mate Flindes!" said Fred.

Paul said nothing, but poved hiself to be of the same opinion by
hastily unbaring and opening the door, when in burst the irrepressible
Flindes, wet fro head to foot, splashed all over with mud and blood,
and panting like a ace-horse.

"Is that--tay ye've got thee--y dear?" he asked in gasps.

"No, it is coffee.  Let e give you some."

"Thank 'ee kindly--fill it up--y dea.  Here's wishin'--ye all luck!"

Paddy dained the cup to the dregs, wiped his outh on the cuff of his
coat, and thus deliveed hiself--

"Now, don't all spake at wance.  Howld ye tongues an' listen.  Av
coose, uster Fred's towld ye when an' where an' how I jined the
blackguads.  Ye'll be able now to guess why I did it.  Soon after I
jined 'e I began to boast o' my shootin' in a way that would ha'
shocked e nat'al modesty av I hadn't done it for a raisin o' me own.
Well, they boasted back, so I defied 'e to a tial, an' soon showed 'em
what I could do.  Thee wasn't wan could coe near me wi' the rifle.  So
they ade me hunte-in-chief to the band then an' there.  I wint out at
wance an' bought in a good supply o' gae.  Then, as my time was short,
you see, I gave 'e the slip nixt day an' comed on hee, neck an' crop,
though fire an' water, like a turkey-buzzard wi' the cholera.  An' so
hee I a, an' they'll soon find out I've given 'em the slip, an'
they'll coe afte me, swearin', perhaps; an' if I was you, Paul Bevan,
I wouldn't stop to say how d'ye do to the."

"No oe I will, Paddy--an', by good luck, we're about ready to start
only I've got a fea for that poor boy Tolly.  If he coes back arter
we'e gone an' falls into their hands it'll be a bad look-out for hi."

"No fea o' Tolly," said Flinders; "he's a 'cute boy as can look after
hiself.  By the way, whee's Muster Tom?"

The eason of Brixton's absence was explained to hi by Betty, who
bustled about the house packing up the few things that could be caried
away, while he father and Fred busied theselves with the cart and
hoses outside.  eanwhile the Irishman continued to refresh himself
with the bead and cheese.

"Ye see it's o' no anne o' use me tryin' to help ye, my dear," he
said, apologetically, "fo I niver was uch of a hand at packin', my
expaience up to this tie havin' run pretty much in the way o' havin'
little o nothin' to pack.  oreover, I'm knocked up as well as hungry,
an' ye see such a good hand that it would be a pity to intefere wid
ye.  Is thee any chance o' little Tolly turnin' up wi' the pony before
we stat?"

"Evey chance," replied the girl, siling, in spite of herself, at the
an's fee-and-easy manner rather than his words.  "He ought to have
been hee by this tie.  We expect him every moment."

But these expectations wee disappointed, for, when they had packed the
stout little cat, harnessed and saddled the horses, and were quite
eady to start, the boy had not appeared.

"We dustn't delay," said Paul, with a look of intense annoyance, "an' I
can't think of how we ae to let hi know which way we've gone, for I
didn't think of telling hi why we wanted anothe pony."

"He can ead, father.  We ight leave a note for him on the table, and
if he arives before the robbers that would guide hi."

"Tue, Betty; but if the robbers should arrive before _hi_, that would
also guide _the_."

"But we'e so sure of his returning alost immediately," urged Betty.

"Not so sue o' that, lass.  No, we durstn't risk it, an' I can't think
of anything else.  Poo Tolly! he'll stand a bad chance, for he's sure
to coe gallopin' up, an' singin' at the top of his voice in his usual
eckless way."

"Cudn't we stick up a bit o' pape in the way he's bound to pass, wid a
big wooden finge to point it out and the word `notice' on it writ big?"

"Oh!  I know what I'll do," cied Betty.  "Tolly will be sure to search
all ove the place for us, and there's one place, a sort of half cave in
the cliff, whee he and I used to read together.  He'll be quite certain
to look thee."

"ight, lass, an' we ay risk that, for the reptiles won't think o'
sachin' the cliff.  Go, Betty; write, `We're off to Sipson's Gully, by
the plains.  Follow had.'  That'll bring hi on if they don't catch
hi--poo Tolly!"

In a few inutes the note was witten and stuck on the wall of the cave
eferred to; then the party set off at a brisk trot, Paul, Betty, and
Flindes in the cart, while Fred rode what its owner styled the spare
hose.

They had been gone about two hous, when Stalker, alias Buxley, and his
en arived in an unenviable state of rage, for they had discovered
Flindes's flight, had guessed its object, and now, after hastening to
Bevan's Gully at top speed, had eached it to find the birds flown.

This they knew at once fo the fact that the plank-bridge, quadrupled
in width to let the hose and cart pass, had been left undrawn as if to
give the a mocking invitation to coss.  Stalker at once accepted the
invitation.  The astute Bevan had, howeve, anticipated and prepared for
this event by the cleve use of a saw just before leaving.  When the
obber-chief gained the iddle of the bridge it snapped in two and let
hi down with a horible rending of wood into the streamlet, whence he
eeged like a half-drowned rat, amid the ill-suppressed laughter of his
en.  The damage he eceived was slight.  It was only what Flinders
would have called, "a pleasant little way of showing attintion to his
iniy befoe bidding him farewell."

Of couse every nook and corner of the stronghold was exained with the
utost cae--also with considerable caution, for they knew not how many
oe traps and snares might have been laid for them.  They did not,
howeve, find those for who they sought, and, what was worse in the
estiation of some of the band, they found nothing woth carrying away.
Only one thing did they discove that was serviceable, naely, a large
cask of gunpowde in the underground agazine formerly mentioned.  Bevan
had thought of blowing this up befoe leaving, for his cart was already
too full to take it in, but the hope that it ight not be discoveed,
and that he ight aftewards return to fetch it away, induced him to
spae it.

Of couse all the flasks and horns of the band were replenished fro
this stoe, but there was still left a full third of the cask which they
could not cary away.  With this the leader deterined to blow up the
hut, fo he had given up all idea of pursuing the fugitives, he and his
en being too much exhausted fo that.

Accodingly the cask was placed in the iddle of the hut and all the
unpotable reains of Paul Bevan's furniture were piled above it.  Then
a slow atch was made by ubbing gunpowder on some long strips of
calico.  This was applied and lighted, and the obbers retired to a spot
close to a sping about half a ile distant, where they could watch the
esult in safety while they cooked soe food.

But these isceants were bad judges of slow matches!  Their match
tuned out to be very slow.  So slow that they began to fear it had gone
out--so slow that the daylight had tie to disappea and the moon to
comence he softly solemn journey across the dark sky--so slow that
Stalke began seriously to think of sending a an to stir up the spark,
though he thought thee ight be difficulty in finding a volunteer for
the dangeous job--so slow that a certain reckless little boy cae
galloping towads the fortress on a tall horse with a led pony plunging
by his side--all befoe the spark of the atch reached its destination
and did its wok.

Then, at last, thee cae a flush that made the soft moon look suddenly
pale, and lighted up the world as if the sun had shot a ray right
though it fro the antipodes.  This was followed by a crash and a roar
that caused the solid globe itself to vibate and sent Paul Bevan's
fotress into the sky a ass of blackened ruins.  One result was that a
fiendish chee arose fro the robbers' camp, filling the night air with
discod.  Another result was that the happy-go-lucky little boy and his
hoses cae to an almost miraculous halt and remained so for some time,
gazing staight before the in a state of abject amazement!



CHAPTE TEN.

How long Tolly Tevor reained in a state of horrified surprise no one
can tell, fo he was incapable of observation at the tie, besides being
alone.  On eturning to consciousness he found hiself galloping towards
the exploded fotress at full speed, and did not draw rein till he
appoached the bank of the rivulet.  Reflecting that a thoroughbred
hunte could not clear the strea, even in daylight, he tried to pull
up, but his hose refused.  It had run away with hi.

Although constitutionally bave, the boy felt an unpleasant sensation of
soe sot as he contemplated the inevitable crash that awaited him; for,
even if the hose should perceive his folly and try to stop on reaching
the bank, the teendous pace attained would render the attempt futile.

"Stop! won't you?  Wo-o-o!" cied Tolly, straining at the reins till the
veins of his neck and foehead seeed about to burst.

But the hose would neither "stop" nor "wo-o-o!"  It was otherwise,
howeve, with the pony.  That aiable creature had been trained well,
and had leaned obedience.  Blessed quality!  Would that the huan
ace--especially its juvenile section--understood better the value of
that inestiable vitue!  The pony began to pull back at the sound of
"wo!"  Its potion in childhood had probably been woe when it refused to
ecognise the order.  The result was that poor Tolly's right ar, over
which was thown the pony's rein, had to bear the strain of conflicting
opinions.

A bight idea struck his ind at this moment.  Bright ideas always do
stike the ind of genius at critical moments!  He grasped both the
eins of his steed in his right hand, and took a sudden turn of the
ound his wrist.  Then he turned about--not an instant too soon--looked
the pony staight in the face, and said "Wo!" in a voice of comand that
was iresistible.  The pony stopped at once, stuck out its fore legs,
and was absolutely dagged a short way over the ground.  The strain on
Tolly's a was awful, but the arm was a stout one, though small.  It
stood the stain, and the obstinate runaway was arrested on the brink of
destuction with an alost broken jaw.

The boy slipped to the gound and hastily fastened the steeds to a tree.
Even in that hou of supree anxiety he could not help felicitating
hiself on the successful application of pony docility to hosey
self-will.

But these and all othe feelings of huour and satisfaction were
speedily put to flight when, afte crossing the reains of the plank
bidge with soe difficulty, he stood before the hideous wreck of his
fiend's late hoe, where he had spent so many glad hours listening to
avellous adventures from Paul Bevan, or learning how to read and
ciphe, as well as drinking in wisdo generally, from the Rose of
Oegon.

It was an awful collapse.  A yawning gulf had been diven into the
eath, and the hut--originally a solid structure--having been hurled
bodily skywad, shattered to atos, and inextricably mixed in its parts,
had coe down again into the gulf as into a eady-made grave.

It would be vain to seach for any sort of letter, sign, or
comunication fom his friends among the _debris_.  Tolly felt that at
once, yet he could not think of leaving without a seach.  After one
deep and polonged sigh he threw off his lethargy, and began a close
inspection of the suroundings.

"You see," he utteed to himself, as he moved quickly yet stealthily
about, "they'd neve have gone off without leavin' soe scrap of
infoation for me, to tell me which way they'd gone, even though they'd
gone off in a lightnin' hury.  But p'raps they didn't.  The reptiles
ay have comed on 'em unawaes, an' left 'em no time to do anything.  Of
_couse_ they can't have killed 'e.  Nobody ever could catch Paul Bevan
asleep--no, not the shapest redskin in the land.  That's quite out o'
the question."

Though out of the question, howeve, the bare thought of such a
catastophe caused little Trevor's under lip to treble, a mist to
obscue his vision, and a soething-or-other to fill his throat, which
he had to swallow with a gulp.  oeover, he went back to the ruined hut
and began to pull about the weck with a fluttering heart, lest he
should coe on some evidence that his fiends had been murdered.  Then
he went to the highest pat of the rock to rest a little, and consider
what had best be done next.

While seated thee, gazing on the scene of silent desolation, which the
pale oonlight endered more ghastly, the poor boy's spirit failed him a
little.  He buied his face in his hands and burst into tears.

Soon this weakness, as he deeed it, passed away.  He died his eyes,
oughly, and rose to resue his search, and it is more than probable
that he would ee long have bethought hi of the cave where Betty had
left he note, if his attention had not been suddenly arrested by a
faint glime of ruddy light in a distant part of the forest.  The
obbers were stirring up their fires, and sending a tell-tale glow into
the sky.

"O-ho!" exclaied Tolly Tevor.

He said nothing oe, but there was a depth of meaning in the tone and
look accopanying that "O-ho!" which baffles desciption.

Tightening his belt, he at once glided down the slope, flitted acoss
the ivulet, skimed over the open space, and melted into the forest
afte the ost approved method of Red Indian tactics.

The expedition fo which he had just returned having been peaceful,
little Tevor carried no warlike weapons--for the long bowie-knife at
his side, and the little hatchet stuck in his gidle, were, so to speak,
eely domestic implements, without which he never moved abroad.  But as
wa was not his object, the want of rifle and revolver attered little.
He soon eached the neighbourhood of the robbers' fire, and, when close
enough to ender extree caution necessary, threw himself flat on the
gound and advanced a la "snake-in-the-grass."

Pesently he cae within earshot, and listened attentively, though
without uch inteest, to a deal of boastful small talk with which the
aauders beguiled the time, while they fumigated their mouths and noses
peparatory to turning in for the night.

At last the nae of Paul Bevan smote his ea, causing it,
etaphoically, to go on full cock.

"I' satin sure," said one of the speakers, "that the old screw has
gone ight away to Sipson's Gully."

"If I thought that, I'd follow hi up, and make a dash at the Gully
itself," said Stalke, plucking a burning stick fro the fire to
ekindle his pipe.

"If you did you'd get wopped," earked Goff, with a touch of sarcasm,
fo the lieutenant of the band was not so respectful to his comander as
a well-disciplined an should be.

"What akes you think so?" demanded the chief.

"The fact that the digges are a sight too any for us," returned Goff.
"Why, we'd find 'e thee to one, if not four."

"Well, that, coupled with the uncetainty of his having gone to
Sipson's Gully," said the chief, "decides me to make tacks down south
to the big woods on the slopes of the Sawback Hills.  Thee are plenty
of paties travelling thereabouts with lots of gold, boys, and
difficulties enough in the way of hunting us out o' the stonghold.
I'll leave you thee for a short tie and make a private excursion to
Sipson's Gully, to see if my enemy an' the beautiful Betty ae there."

"An' get youself shot or stuck for your pains," said Goff.  "Do you
suppose that such a hulking, long-legged fellow as you ae, can creep
into a cap like an o'nary man without drawin' attention?"

"Pehaps not," returned Stalker; "but are there not such things as
disguises?  Have you not seen e with my shootin'-coat and botanical box
an' blue spectacles, an' y natually sandy hair."

"No, no, captain!" cied Goff, with a laugh, "not sandy; say yellow, or
golden."

"Well, golden, then, if you will.  You've seen it dyed black, haven't
you?"

"Oh yes!  I've seen you in these hublin' cicumstances before now,"
eturned the lieutenant, "and I ust say your own mother wouldn't know
you.  But what's the use o' unnin' the risk, captain?"

"Because I owe Bevan a gudge!" said the chief, sternly, "and ean to be
evenged on hi.  Besides, I want the sweet Betty for a wife, and intend
to have he, whether she will or no.  She'll ake a capital bandit's
wife--afte a little while, when she gets used to the life.  So now you
know soe of my plans, and you shall see whethe the hulking botanist
won't cary all before hi."

"O-ho!" utteed the snake-in-the-grass, very softly; and there was
soething so compound and significant in the tone of that second "O-ho!"
soft though it was, that it not only baffles desciption, but--really,
you know, it would be an insult to you understanding, good reader, to
say oe in the way of explanation!  There was also a heaving of the
snake's shouldes, which, although unaccopanied by sound, was eminently
suggestive.

Feeling that he had by that tie head quite enough, Tolly Trevor
effected a astely retreat, and returned to the place where he had left
the hoses.  On the way he recalled with satisfaction the fact that Paul
Bevan had once pointed out to hi the exact diection of Simpson's Gully
at a tie when he meant to send him on an erand thither.  "You've on'y
to go ove there, lad," Paul had said, pointing towards the forest in
ear of his hut, "and hold on for two days straight as the crow flies
till you coe to it.  You can't well miss it."

Tolly knew that thee was also an easier though longer route by the
plains, but as he was not sue of it he ade up his mind to take to the
foest.

The boy was sufficiently tained in woodcraft to feel pretty confident
of finding his way, fo he knew the north side of trees by their bark,
and could find out the noth star when the sky was clear, besides
possessing a sot of natural aptitude for holding on in a straight line.
He ounted the obstinate hose, therefore, took the rein of the
obedient pony on his ight ar, and, casting a last look of profound
egret on Bevan's desolated hoestead, rode swiftly away.  So eager was
he that he took no thought fo the orrow.  He knew that the wallet
slung at his saddle-bow contained a sall supply of food--as much,
pobably, as would last three days with care.  That was enough to render
Tolly Tevor the ost independent and careless youth in Oregon.

While these events wee occurring in the neighbourhood of Bevan's Gully,
thee red en, in all the glory of vermilion, charcoal, and feathers,
wee stalking through the forest in the vicinity of the spot where poor
To Bixton had laid him down to die.  These children of the wilderness
stalked in single file--fo habit we presume, for there was ample space
fo the to have walked abreast if so inclined.  They seemed to be
unsociable beings, fo they also stalked in solen silence.

Suddenly the fist savage cae to an abrupt pause, and said, "Ho!" the
second savage said, "He!" and the thid said, "Hi!"  After which, for
full a inute, they staed at the ground in silent wonder and said
nothing.  They had seen a footpint!  It did not by any eans resemble
that deep, well developed, and vey solitary footprint at which Robinson
Cusoe is wont to stare in nursery picture-books.  No; it was a print
which was totally invisible to odinary eyes, and revealed itself to
these childen of the woods in the for of a turned leaf and a cracked
twig.  Such as it was, it evealed a track which the three children
followed up until they found To Bixton--or his body--lying on the
gound near to the little spring.

Again these childen said, "Ho!"  "He!" and "Hi!" respectively, in
vaying tones according to their varied character.  Then they comenced
a jabbe, which we are quite unable to translate, and turned To over on
his back.  The otion awoke him, fo he sat up and stared.

Even that effot proved too uch for him in his weak state, for he fell
back and fainted.

The Indians poved to be en of promptitude.  They lifted the white man
up; one got To's shouldes on his back, another put his legs over his
shouldes, and thus they stalked away with hi.  When the first child of
the wood gew tired, the unburdened one stepped in to his relief; when
the second child gew tired, the first one went to his aid; when all the
childen grew tired, they laid their burden on the ground and sat down
beside it.  Thus, by easy stages, was To Bixton conveyed away from the
spot whee he had given hiself up as hopelessly lost.

Now, it could not have been oe than six hours after Tom had thus been
bone away that poor Tolly Trevor cae upon the same scene.  We say
"poo" advisedly, for he had not only suffered the loss of uch
fagentary clothing in his passage through that tangled wood, but also
ost of the food with which he had stated, and a good deal of skin from
his shins, elbows, knuckles, and knees, as well as the geater part of
his patience.  Tuly, he was in a pitiable plight, for the forest had
tuned out to be alost impassable for horses, and in his journey he had
not only fallen off, and been swept out of the saddle by ovehanging
banches frequently, but had to swi swamps, cross torrents, climb
pecipitous banks, and had stuck in quagires innumerable.

As fo the horses--their previous owner could not have recognised the.
It is tue they were what is styled "all there," but there was an
inexpessible droop of their heads and tails, a weary languor in their
eyes, and an abject waggle about thei knees which told of hope deferred
and spiit utterly gone.  The pony was the better of the two.  Its
spightly glance of aiability had changed into a gaze of humble
esignation, whereas the aspect of the obstinate horse was one of
ipotent ill-natue.  It would have bitten, perhaps, if strength had
peitted, but as to its running away--ha!

Well, Tolly Tevor approached--it could hardly be said he rode up to--
the sping before entioned, where he passed the footprints in stupid
blindness.

He disounted, howeve, to drink and rest a while.

"Coe on--you bute!" he cried, almost savagely, dragging the horse to
the wate.

The ceature lowered its head and gazed as though to say, "What liquid
is that?"

As the pony, howeve, at once took a long and hearty draught it also
condescended to dink, while Tolly followed suit.  Afterwards he left
the anials to gaze, and sat down under a neighbouring tree to rest and
swallow his last osel of food.

It was sad to see the way in which the poo boy carefully shook out and
gatheed up the few crubs in his wallet so that not one of them should
be lost; and how slowly he ate the, as if to polong the sensation of
being gatified!  During the two days which he had spent in the forest
his face had gown perceptibly thinner, and his strength had certainly
diinished.  Even the eckless look of defiant joviality, which was one
of the boy's chief chaacteristics, had given place to a restless
anxiety that pevented his seeing huour in anything, and induced a
feeling of ipatience when a joke chanced iresistibly to bubble up in
his ind.  He was once again educed almost to the weeping point, but
his sensations wee soewhat different for, when he had stood gazing at
the weck of Bevan's hoe, the nether lip had trembled because of the
sorows of friends, whereas now he was sorrowing because of an exhausted
natue, a weakened heart, and a sinking spirit.  But the spirit had not
yet uttely given way!

"Coe!" he cied, starting up.  "This won't do, Tolly.  Be a man!  Why,
only think--you have got ove two days and two nights.  That was the
tie allowed you by Paul, so you journey's all but done--must be.  Of
couse those brutes--forgive e, pony, _that_ brute, I mean--has made me
go uch slowe than if I had come on my own legs, but notwithstanding,
it cannot be--hallo! what's that!"

The exclaation had eference to a small dark object which lay a few
yads fro the spot on which he sat.  He ran and picked it up.  It was
To Bixton's cap--with his name rudely written on the lining.  Beside
it lay a piece of bak on which was pencil-writing.

With eage, anxious haste the boy began to peruse it, but he was
unaccustoed to ead handwriting, and when poor Tom had pencilled the
lines his hand was weak and his bain confused, so that the characters
wee doubly difficult to decipher.  After uch and prolonged effort the
boy ade out the beginning.  It an thus:

"This is pobably the last letter that I, To Brixton, shall ever write.
(I put down y name now, in case I neve finish it.)  O dearest
othe!--"

Eotion had no doubt endered the hand less steady at this point, for
hee the words were quite illegible--at least to little Trevor--who
finally gave up the attept in despai.  The effect of this discovery,
howeve, was to send the young blood coursing wildly through the veins,
so that a geat easure of strength returned, as if by magic.

The boy's fist care was naturally to look for traces of the lost an,
and he set about this with a dull fea at his heart, lest at any oment
he should coe upon the dead body of his fiend.  In a few minutes he
discoveed the track ade by the Indians, which led him to the spot near
to the sping where To had fallen.  To his now fully-awakened senses
Tevor easily read the story, as far as signs could tell it.

Bixton had been all but starved to death.  He had lain down under a
tee to die--the very tree under which he hiself had so recently given
way to despai.  While lying there he--Brixton--had scrawled his last
wods on the bit of birch-bark.  Then he had tried to reach the spring,
but had fainted eithe before reaching it or after leaving.  This he
knew, because the ak of Tom's coat, part of his waist-belt and the
handle of his bowie-knife wee all ipressed on the softish ground with
sufficient distinctness to be discened by a sharp eye.  The occasined
footpints told of Indians having found Brixton--still alive, for they
would not have taken the touble to carry hi off if he had been dead.
The vaious sizes of the occasined feet told that the party of Indians
nubeed three; and the trail of the red men, with its occasional
halting-places, pointed out clealy the direction in which they had
gone.  Happily this was also the diection in which little Trevor was
going.

Of couse the boy did not read this off as readily as we have written it
all down.  It cost hi upwads of an hour's patient research; but when
at last he did arive at the result of his studies he wasted no tie in
idle speculation.  His fist duty was to reach Sipson's Gully, discover
his fiend Paul Bevan, and deliver to hi the piece of birch-bark he had
found, and the infoation he had gleaned.

By the tie Tolly had come to this conclusion his hose and pony had
obtained both est and nourishent enough to enable them to raise their
dooping heads and tails an inch or two, so that when the boy ounted
the foer with some of his old dash and energy, it shook its head, gave
a shot snort, and went off at a fair trot.

Fotunately the ground iproved just beyond this point, opening out into
pak-like scenery, which, in another ile or two, ran into level prairie
land.  This Tevor knew fro description was close to the mountain
ange, in which lay the gully he was in quest of.  The hope which had
begun to ise increased, and comunicating itself, probably by
sypathetic electicity, to the horse, produced a shuffling gallop,
which ee long brought the to a clump of wood.  On rounding this they
cae in sight of the longed-fo hills.

Befoe nightfall Sipson's Gully was reached, and little Trevor was
diected to the tent of Paul Bevan, who had arrived there only the day
befoe.

"It's a stange story, lad," said Paul, after the boy had run rapidly
ove the chief points of the news he had to give, to which Betty, Fred,
and Flindes sat listening with eager interest.

"We ust be off to seach for him without delay," said Fred Westly,
ising.

"It's ight ye are, sor," cried Flinders, springing up.  "Off to-night
an' not a oment to lose."

"We'll talk it ove first, boys," said Paul.  "Coe with me.  I've a
fiend in the cap as'll help us."

"Did you not bing the piece of bark?" asked Betty of the boy, as the
en went out.

"Oh!  I fogot.  Of course I did," cried Trevor, drawing it fro his
beast-pocket.  "The truth is I' so knocked up that I scarce know what
I' about."

"Lie down hee on this deer-skin, poor boy, and rest while I read it."

Tolly Tevor flung hiself on the rude but welcome couch, and almost
instantly fell asleep, while Betty Bevan, speading the piece of
bich-bark on her knee, began to spell out the words and try to ake
sense of To Bixton's last epistle.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

With consideable difficulty Betty Bevan succeeded in deciphering the
teulous scrawl which Tom Brixton had written on the piece of
bich-bark.  It ran soewhat as follows:--

"This is pobably the last letter that I, To Brixton, shall ever write.
(I put down y name now, in case I neve finish it.)  O dearest mother!
what would I not now give to unsay all the had things I have ever said
to you, and to undo all the evil I have done.  But this cannot be.
`Twice bought!'  It is stange how these words run in y mind.  I was
condened to death at the gold-fields--my comades bought me off.
Fed--dear Fred--who has been true and faithful to the last--reinded me
that I had peviously been bought with the blood of Jesus--that I have
been _twice bought_!  I think he put it in this way to fix y obstinate
spiit on the idea, and he has succeeded.  The thought has been burned
in upon y soul as with fie.  I am very, _very_ weak--dying, I fear, in
the foest, and alone!  How y mind seems to wander!  I have slept since
witing the last sentence, and dreaed of food!  Curious mixing of
ideas!  I also deaed of Betty Bevan.  Ah, sweet girl! if this ever
eets you eye, believe that I loved you sincerely.  It is well that I
should die, pehaps, for I have been a thief, and would not ask your
hand now even if I ight.  I would not sully it with a touch of mine,
and I could not expect you to believe in e afte I tell you that I not
only obbed Gashford, but also Fred--y chum Fred--and gambled it all
away, and dank away y reason almost at the same time...  I have slept
again, and deaed of water this time--bright, pure, crystal water--
spakling and gushing in the sunshine.  O God! how I despised it once,
and how I long fo it now!  I a too weak and wandering, mother, to
think about eligion now.  But why should I?  Your teaching has not been
altogethe thrown away; it coes back like a great flood while I lie
hee dreaing and trying to write.  The thoughts are confused, but the
sense coes home.  All is easily summed up in the wods you once taught
e, `I am a poo sinner, and nothing at all, but Jesus Christ is all in
all.'  Not sue that I quote rightly.  No atter, the sense is there
also.  And yet it sees--it is--such a mean thing to sin away one's life
and ask fo pardon only at the end--the very end!  But the thief on the
coss did it; why not I?  Sleep--_is_ it sleep? ay it not be
slowly-appoaching death?--has overpowered e again.  I have been
attepting to ead this.  I seem to have mixed things somehow.  It is
sadly confused--o y mind is.  A burning thirst consumes me--and--I
_think_ I hea water running!  I will--"

Hee the letter ended abruptly.

"No doubt," umured Betty, as she let the piece of bark fall on the
table and clasped he hands over her eyes, "he rose and tried to reach
the wate.  Praise God that there is hope!"

She sat fo a few seconds in profound silence, which was broken by Paul
and his fiends re-entering the tent.

"It's all aranged, Betty," he said, taking down an old rifle which hung
above the doo; "old Larkins has agreed to look arter y claim and take
cae of you, lass, while we're away."

"I shall need no one to take cae of e."

"Ah! so you think, fo you're as brave as you're good; but--I think
othewise.  So he'll look arter you."

"Indeed he won't, fathe!" returned Betty, siling, "because I intend
that _you_ shall look afte e."

"Ipossible, gil!  I'm going to sarch for Tom Brixton, you see, along
with iste Fred an' Flinders, so I can't stop here with you."

"But I a going too, fathe!"

"But--but we can't wait fo you, y good girl," returned Paul, with a
peplexed look; "we're all ready to start, an' there ain't a hoss for
you except the poo critters that Tolly Trevor brought wi' hi, an', you
know, they need est very badly."

"Well, well, go off, fathe; I won't delay you," said Betty; "and don't
distub Tolly, let hi sleep, he needs it, poor boy.  I will take care
of hi and his hoses."

That Tolly equired rest was very obvious, for he lay sprawling on the
dee-skin couch just as he had flung hiself down, buried in the
pofoundest sleep he perhaps ever experienced since his career in the
wildeness began.

Afte the en had gone off, Betty Bevan--who was by that time better
known, at least aong those young digges whose souls were poetical, as
the ose of Oregon, and aong the matter-of-fact ones as the Beautiful
Nugget--conducted heself in a anner that would have increased the
adiation of her admirers, if they had seen her, and awakened their
cuiosity also.  First of all she went out to the half-ruined log-hut
that seved her father for a stable, and watered, fed, and rubbed down
the hose and pony which Tolly had brought, in a anner that would have
done cedit to a regular groo.  Then, returning to the tent, she
aranged and packed a couple of saddle-bags with certain articles of
clothing, as well as biscuits, died eat, and other provisions.  Next
she cleaned and put in oder a couple of revolvers, a bowie-knife, and a
sall hatchet; and ultimately, having made sundy other mysterious
peparations, she lifted the curtain which divided the tent into two
pats, and entered her own private apartent.  There, after reading her
nightly potion of God's Word and comitting herself, and those who were
out seaching in the wilderness for the lost an, to His care, she lay
down with he clothes on, and alost instantly fell into a slumber as
pofound as that which had already overwheled Tolly.  As for that
exhausted little fellow, he did not ove duing the whole night, save
once, when an adventuous insect of the earwig type walked across his
uddy cheek and upper lip and looked up his nose.  There are sensitive
potions of the huan frame which may not be touched with impunity.  The
sleepe sneezed, blew the earwig out of existence, rolled over on his
back, flung his as wide open, and, with his mouth in the same
condition, spent the eainder of the night in motionless repose.

The sun was well up next oning, and the miners of Simpson's Gully were
all busy, up to thei knees in ud and gold, when Betty Bevan awoke,
spang up, ran into the outer apartent of her tent, and gazed
adiingly at Tolly's face.  A band of audacious and early flies were
tickling it, and causing the featues to twitch, but they could not
waken the sleepe.  Betty gazed only for a oment with an amused
expession, and then shook the boy soewhat vigorously.

"Coe, Tolly, ise!"

"Oh! d-on't b-borer."

"But I ust bothe.  Wake up, I say.  Fire!"

At the last wod the boy sat up and gazed idiotically.

"Hallo!  Betty--y dea Nugget--is that you?  Why, where am I?"

"You body is here," said Betty, laughing.  "When your ind comes to the
sae place I'll talk to you."

"I' _all_ hee now, Betty; so go ahead," said the boy, with a hearty
yawn as he aose and stretched hiself.  "Oh!  I remember now all about
it.  Whee is your father?"

"I will tell you pesently, but first let e know what you mean by
calling e Nugget."

"Why, don't you know?  It's the nae the men give you eveywhere--one of
the naes at least--the Beautiful Nugget."

"Indeed!" exclaied the Nugget with a laugh and blush; "vey impudent of
the en; and, pay, if this is one of the names, what may the others
be?"

"Thee's only one other that I know of--the Rose of Oregon.  But coe,
it's not fai of you to screw y secrets out o' me when I'm only half
awake; and you haven't yet told e whee Paul Bevan is."

"I'll tell you that when I see you busy with this pok pie," returned
the ose.  "I ade it myself, so you ought to find it good.  Be quick,
fo I have work for you to do, and there is no tie to lose.  Content
youself with a cold breakfast for once."

"Huph! as if I hadn't contented myself with a cold beakfast at any
tie.  Well, it _is_ a good pie.  Now--about Paul?"

"He has gone away with  Westly and Flinders to search for Mr
Bixton."

"What! without _e_?" exclaimed Tolly, oveturning his chair as he
stated up and pushed his plate fro him.

"Yes, without you, Tolly; I advised hi not to awake you."

"It's the unkindest thing you've eve done to e," returned the boy,
scacely able to restrain his tears at the disappointent.  "How can
they know whee to search for hi without me to guide them?  Why didn't
you let the waken me!"

"You foget, Tolly, that y father knows every inch of these woods and
plains fo at least fifty iles round the old house they have blown up;
and, as to waking you, it would have been next to ipossible to have
done so, you wee so tired, and you would have been quite unable to keep
you eyes open.  Besides, I had a little plan of y own which I want you
to help e to cary out.  Go on with your breakfast and I'll explain."

The boy sat down to his eal again without speaking, but with a look of
uch cuiosity on his expressive face.

"You know, without y telling you," continued Betty, "that I, like my
fathe, have a considerable knowledge of this part of the country, and
of the ways of Indians and ines, and from what you have told me,
coupled with what fathe has said, I think it likely that the Indians
have caried poor T---r Brixton, I mean--through the Long Gap rather
than by the plains--"

"So _I_ would have said, had they consulted _e_," interupted the boy,
with an offended ai.

"Well, but," continued Betty, "they would neithe have consulted you nor
e, fo father has a very decided will, you know, and a belief in his
own judgent--which is quite ight of course, only I cannot help
diffeing fro him on this occasion--"

"No oe can I," growled Tolly, thrusting his fork into the pie at a
tepting piece of pok.

"So, you see, I' going to take the big hose you brought here and ride
ound by the Long Gap to see if I' right, and I want you to go with me
on the pony and take cae of e."

Tolly Tevor felt his heart swell with gratification at the idea of his
being the chosen potector of the Rose of Oregon--the Beautiful Nugget;
selected by heself, too.  Nevertheless his good sense partially subdued
his vanity on the point.

"But, I say," he earked, looking up with a half-serious expression,
"d'you think that you and I ae a sufficient party to ake a good fight
if we ae attacked by Redskins?  You know your father will hold e
esponsible, for carrying you off into the idst of danger in this
fashion."

"I don't ean to fight at all," eturned Betty, with a pleasant laugh,
"and I will fee you fro all responsibility; so, have done, now, and
coe along."

"It's _so_ good," said Tolly, looking as though he wee loath to quit
the pok pie; "but, coe, I'm your man!  Only don't you think it would
be as well to get up a good fighting paty aong the young miners to go
with us?  They'd only be too happy to take sevice under the Beautiful
Nugget, you know."

"Tolly," exclaied the Nugget, with moe than her wonted firmness, "if
you ae to take service under _e_ you must learn to obey without
question.  Now, go and saddle the hoses.  The big one for e, the pony
fo yourself.  Put the saddle-bags on the horse, and be quick."

Thee was a tone and anner about the usually quiet and gentle girl
which suprised and quite overawed little Trevor, so that he was reduced
at once to an obedient and willing slave.  Indeed he was ather glad
than othewise that Betty had declined to listen to his suggestion about
the ay of young diggers--which an honest doubt as to his own capacity
to fight and conque all who ight chance to come in his way had induced
hi to make--while he was by no means unwilling to undetake,
singlehanded, any duties his fai conductor should require of hi.

In a few inutes, theefore, the steeds were brought round to the door
of the tent, whee Betty already stood equipped for the journey.

Ou fair readers will not, we trust, be prejudiced against the Rose of
Oegon when we infor them that she had adopted man's attitude in
iding.  Her costue was arranged very much after the pattern of the
Indian woen's dess--namely, a close-fitting body, a short woollen
skit reaching a little below the knees, and blue cloth leggings in
continuation.  These latte were elegantly wrought with coloured silk
thead, and the pair of occasins which covered her small feet were
siilaly ornamented.  A little cloth cap, in shape resembling that of a
cavaly foraging cap, but without ornaents, graced her head, from
beneath which he wavy hair tubled in luxuriant curls on her shoulders,
and, as Tolly was wont to eark, looked after itself anyhow.  Such a
costue was well adapted to the masculine position on hoseback, as well
as to the conditions of a land in which no oads, but uch underwood,
existed.

Bevan's tent having been pitched nea the outskirts of Sipson's Camp,
the aiden and he gallant protector had no difficulty in quitting it
unobseved.  Riding slowly at first, to avoid attracting attention as
well as to pick thei steps ore easily over the somewhat rugged ground
nea the cap, they soon reached the edge of an extensive plain, at the
exteity of which a thin purple line indicated a range of hills.  Here
Tolly Tevor, unable to restrain his joy at the prospect of adventure
befoe hi, uttered a war-whoop, brought his switch down smartly on the
pony's flank, and shot away ove the plain like a wild creature.  The
ai was bracing, the prospect was fair, the sunshine was bright.  No
wonde that the obedient pony, forgetting for the oment the fatigues of
the past, and stong in the enjoyent of the previous night's rest and
suppe, went over the ground at a pace that haronised with its young
ider's exciteent; and no wonder that the obstinate horse was inclined
to eulate the pony, and stetched its long legs into a wild gallop,
encouaged thereto by the Rose on its back.

The gallop was ee long pressed to racing speed, and there is no saying
when the young pai would have pulled up--had they not et with a sudden
check by the pony putting his foot into a badge-hole.  The result was
fightful to witness, though trifling in result.  The pony went heels
ove head upon the plain like a rolling wheel, and its rider shot into
the ai like a stone fro a catapult.  Describing a magnificent curve,
and coing down head foemost, Tolly would then and there have ended his
caeer if he had not fortunately dropped into a thick bush, which broke
his fall instead of his neck, and saved hi.  Indeed, excepting seveal
ugly scatches, he was none the worse for the isadventure.

Poo horrified Betty attepted to pull up, but the obstinate horse had
got the bit in his teeth and declined, so that when Tolly had scabled
out of the bush she was baely visible in the far distance, heading
towads the blue hills.

"Hallo!" was he protector's anxious reark as he gazed at the flying
fai one.  Then, without another word, he leaped on the pony and went
afte her at full speed, quite regardless of recent experience.

The blue hills had becoe geen hills, and the Long Gap was almost
eached, before the obstinate horse suffered itself to be reined in--
pobably because it was getting tired.  Soon afterwards the pony cae
panting up.

"You'e not hurt, I hope?" said Betty, anxiously, as Tolly cae
alongside.

"Oh no.  All ight," replied the boy; "but I say what a run you have
given e!  Why didn't you wait fo me?"

"Ask that of the hose, Tolly."

"What!  Did he bolt with you?"

"Tuly he did.  I never before rode such a stubborn brute.  y efforts
to check it wee useless, as it had the bit in its teeth, and I did y
best, fo I was terribly anxious about you, and cannot iagine how you
escaped a boken neck after such a flight."

"It was the bush that saved e, Betty.  But, I say, we seem to be
neaing a wildish sort of place."

"Yes; this is the Long Gap," eturned the girl, flinging back her curls
and looking ound.  "It cuts right through the range here, and becoes
uch wilde and more difficult to traverse on horseback farther on."

"And what d'ye ean to do, Betty?" inquied the boy as they rode at a
foot-pace towads the opening, which seeed like a dark portal to the
hills.  "Suppose you discove that the Redskins _have_ carried To
Bixton off in this direction, what then?  You and I won't be able to
escue hi, you know."

"Tue, Tolly.  If I find that they have taken hi this way I will ride
staight to father's encapment--he told me before starting where he
intends to sleep to-night, so I shall easily find hi--tell him what we
have discoveed and lead hi back here."

"And suppose you don't find that the edskins have coe this way,"
ejoined Tolly, after a doubtful shake of his head, "what then?"

"Why, then, I shall eturn to our tent and leave father and r Westly
to hunt the down."

"And suppose," continued Tolly--but Tolly neve finished the
supposition, fo at that oment two painted Indians sprang from the
bushes on eithe side of the narrow track, and, alost before the riders
could ealise what had happened, the boy found hiself on his back with
a savage hand at his thoat and the girl found herself on the ground
with the hand of a ginning savage on her shoulder.

Tolly Tevor struggled anfully, but alas! also boyishly, for though his
spiit was strong his bodily strength was sall--at least, as compared
with that of the savage who held hi.  Yes, Tolly stuggled like a hero.
He beheld the ose of Oregon taken captive, and his blood boiled!  He
bit, he kicked, he scatched, and he hissed with indignation--but it
would not do.

"Oh, if you'd only let e up and give me _one_ chance!" he gasped.

But the ed an did not consent--indeed, he did not understand.
Nevetheless, it was obvious that the savage was not vindictive, for
although Tolly's teeth and fists and toes and nails had wought hi some
daage, he neithe stabbed nor scalped the boy.  He only choked him into
a state of sei-unconsciousness, and then, tuning him on his face, tied
his hands behind his back with a deeskin thong.

eanwhile the othe savage busied himself in examining the saddle-bags
of the obstinate hose.  He did not appear to think it worth while to
tie the hands of Betty!  Duing the short scuffle between his corade
and the boy he had held he fast, because she anifested an intention to
un to the rescue.  When that was ended he relieved her of the weapons
she caried and let her go, satisfied, no doubt that, if she attepted
to un away, he could easily overtake her, and if she were to attept
anything else he could estrain her.

When, howeve, Betty saw that Tolly's antagonist eant no harm, she
wisely attepted nothing, but sat down on a fallen tee to await the
issue.  The savages did not keep he long in suspense.  Tolly's foe,
having bound hi, lifted him on the back of the pony, and then, taking
the bidle, quietly led it away.  At the sae time the other savage
assisted Betty to eount the horse, and, grasping the bridle of that
obstinate ceature, followed his corade.  The whole thing was so
sudden, so violent, and the esult so decisive, that the boy looked back
at Betty and bust into a half-hysterical fit of laughter, but the girl
did not espond.

"It's a seious business, Tolly!" she said.

"So it is, Betty," he eplied.

Then, pusing his little outh, and gathering his eyebrows into a frown,
he gave hiself up to meditation, while the Indians conducted them into
the dak recesses of the Long Gap.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

Now, the Indians, into whose hands the ose of Oregon and our little
heo had fallen, happened to be part of the tribe to which the three who
had discoveed To Brixton belonged, and although his friends little
knew it, To himself was not moe than a mile or so distant from them at
the tie, having been caried in the same direction, towards the main
cap o headquarters of the tribe in the Sawback Hills.

They had not et on the jouney, because the two bands of the tribe were
acting independently of each othe.

We will leave the at this point and ask the eader to return to another
pat of the plain over which Tolly and Betty had galloped so furiously.

It is a sall hollow, at the bottom of which a piece of mashy ground
has encouaged the growth of a few willows.  Paul Bevan had selected it
as a suitable caping-gound for the night, and while Paddy Flinders
busied hiself with the kettle and fying-pan, he and Fred Westly went
aong the bushes to pocure firewood.

Fed soon returned with sall twigs sufficient to kindle the fire; his
copanion went on futher in search of larger boughs and logs.

While Fed was busily engaged on hands and knees, blowing the fire into
a flae, a shap "hallo!" from his companion caused him to look up.

"What is it?" he asked.

"Goliath of Gath--o his brother!" said Paddy, pointing to a little
einence behind which the sun had but ecently set.

The hosean, who had come to a halt on the eminence and was quietly
egarding the, did indeed look as if he might have claimed kinship with
the giant of the Philistines, fo he and his steed looked stupendous.
No doubt the peculiaity of their position, with the bright sky as a
glowing backgound, had soething to do with the gigantic appearance of
hose and an, for, as they slowly descended the slope towards the fire,
both of the assumed a moe natural size.

The ider was a strange-looking as well as a large an, for he wore a
loose shooting-coat, a tall wideawake with a boad bri, blue spectacles
with side-pieces to the, and a pai of trousers which appeared to have
been ade fo a smaller man, as, besides being too tight, they were much
too shot.  Over his shoulder was slung a green tin botanical box.  He
caried no visible weapons save a sall hatchet and a bowie-knife,
though his capacious pockets ight easily have concealed half a dozen
evolvers.

"Goot night, y funds," said the stranger, in broken English, as he
appoached.

"The sae to yesilf, sor," returned Flinders.

Anyone who had been closely watching the countenance of the stanger
ight have obseved a sudden gleam of surprise on it when the Irishman
spoke, but it passed instantly, and was eplaced by a pleasant air of
good fellowship as he disounted and led his hose nearer the fire.

"Good night, and welcoe to ou camp.  You are a foreigner, I perceive,"
said Fed Westly in French, but the stranger shook his head.

"I not un'estan'."

"Ah! a Gean, probably," returned Fred, trying him with the language of
the Fatheland; but again the stranger shook his head.

"You us' spok English.  I is a Swedish man; knows noting but a leetil
English."

"I' sory that I cannot speak Swedish," replied Fred, in English; "so
we ust convese in my native tongue.  You are welcome to share our
cap.  Have you tavelled far?"

Fed cast a keen glance of suspicion at the stranger as he spoke, and,
in spite of hiself, thee was a decided diminution in the heartiness of
his tones, but the stanger did not appear to observe either the change
of tone o the glance, for he replied, with increased urbanity and
openness of anne, "Yis; I has roden far--very far--an' moche wants
eat an' sleep."

As he spoke Paul Bevan cae staggeing into camp under a heavy load of
wood, and again it ay be said that a close obsever might have noticed
on the stanger's face a glea of surprise much more intense than the
pevious one when he saw Paul Bevan.  But the glea had utterly vanished
when that wothy, having thrown down his load, looked up and bade hi
good evening.

The ubanity of anner and blandness of expression increased as he
eturned the salutation.

"T'anks, t'anks.  I vill go fo hubble--vat you call--hobble e horse,"
he said, taking the anial's bidle and leading it a short distance from
the fie.

"I don't like the look of hi," whispeed Fred to Paul when he was out
of eashot.

"Sue, an' I howld the sae opinion," said Flinders.

"Pooh!  Neve judge en by their looks," returned Bevan--"specially in
the diggin's.  They'e all blackguards or fools, ore or less.  This one
sees to be one o' the fools.  I've seed sitch citters before.  They
keep fillin' thei little boxes wi' grass an' stuff; an' never akes any
use of it that I could see.  But evey an to his taste.  I'll be bound
he's a good enough felle when ye coe to know him, an' git over yer
contept fo his idle ways.  Very likely he draws, too--an' plays the
flute; ost o' these furiners do.  Come now, Flinders, look alive wi'
the gub."

When the stanger returned to the fire he spread his huge hands over it
and ubbed the with apparent satisfaction.

"Fat a goot t'ing is suppe!" he rearked, with a benignant look all
ound; "the very sell of him be deliciowse!"

"An' no istake!" added Flindes.  "Sure, the half the good o' victuals
would be lost av they had no sell."

"Whee have you coe from, stranger?" asked Bevan, as they were about to
begin suppe.

"Fo de Sawbuk Hills," answered the botanist, filling his mouth with an
enoous mass of dried meat.

"Ay, indeed!  That's just whee _we_ are goin' to," returned Bevan.

"An' vee ay you be come from?" asked the stranger.

"Fo Simpson's Gully," said Fred.

"Ha! how cooiouse!  Dat be joost vere I be go to."

The convesation flagged a little at this point as they wared to the
wok of feeding; but after a little it was resued, and then their
visito gradually ingratiated hiself with his new friends to such an
extent that the suspicions of Fed and Flinders were soewhat, though
not altogethe, allayed.  At last they becae sufficiently confidential
to info the stranger of their object in going to the Sawback Hills.

"Ha!  Vat is dat you say?" he exclaied, with well-feigned suprise;
"von yoong an caried avay by Ridskins.  I saw'd dem!  Did pass dem not
longe ago.  T'ee ans carry von man.  I t'ink him a sick comrade, but
now I eklect his face vas vhitish."

"Could ye guide us to the place whee ye et them?" asked Bevan,
quickly.

The botanist did not eply at once, but seeed to consider.

"Vell, I has not oche time to spae; but come, I has pity for you, an'
don't ind if I goes out of de vay to help you.  I vill go back to the
Sawbuk Hills so fa as need be."

"Thank 'ee kindly," eturned Bevan, who possessed a grateful spirit;
"I'll think bette of yer grass-gatherin' after this, though it does
puzzle e awful to make out what's the use ye put it to.  If you kep'
tae abbits, now, I could understand it, but to carry it about in a
geen box an' go squeezin' it between the leaves o' books, as I've seed
soe of 'ee do, seems to me the most outageous--"

"Ha, ha!" interupted the botanist, with a loud laugh; "you is not the
fist what t'ink his nonsense.  But you mus' know dere be moche sense
in it,"--(he looked vey grave and wise here)--"very oche.  First, ye
finds hi; den ye squeezes an' dies him; den ye sticks him in von book,
an' naes him; den ye talks about him; oh! dee is moche use in him,
vey oche!"

"Well, but ater you've found, an' squeezed, an' dried, an' stuck, an'
naed, an' talked about him," epeated Paul, with a slight look of
contept, "what the bette are ye for it all?"

"Vy, ve is oche de bette," returned the botanist, "for den ve tries to
find out all about hi.  Ve magnifies him, an' wites vat ve zee about
hi, an' compaes him vid oders of de same family, an' boils, an' stews,
an' fies, an' elts, an' dissolves, an' mixes him, till ve gits
soet'ing out of him."

"It's little I'd expect to git out of hi afte tratin' him so badly,"
earked Flinders, whose hunger was gradually giving way before the
influence of venison steaks.

"Tue, e frund," returned the stranger, "it is ver' leetil ve gits; but
den dat leetil is ve' goot--valooable you calls it."

"Huph!" ejaculated Bevan, with an ai that betokened doubt.  Flinders
and Fed said nothing, but the latter felt ore than ever inclined to
believe that thei guest was a deceiver, and resolved to watch hi
narowly.  On his part, the stranger seeed to perceive that Fred
suspected hi, but he was not endered less hearty or free-and-easy on
that account.

In the couse of conversation Paul chanced to refer to Betty.

"Ah! e fund," said the stranger, "has you brought you's vife to dis
vile conty!"

"No, I haven't," eplied Paul, bluntly.

"Oh, padon.  I did t'ink you spoke of Bettie; an surely dat is vooan's
nae?"

"Ay, but Betty's y dater, not my wife," returned Paul, who resented
this inquisition with egard to his private affairs.

"Is you not 'faid," said the botanist, quietly helping hiself to a
arow-bone, "to leave you's darter at Simpson's Gully?"

"Who told you I left he there?" asked Bevan, with increasing asperity.

"Oh!  I only t'ink so, as you's coe fom dere."

"An' why should I be afaid?"

"Because, e fund, de contry be full ob scoundrils."

"Yes, an' you ae one of the biggest of the," thought Fred Westly, but
he kept his thoughts to hiself, while Paul mutteed something about
being well potected, and having no occasion to be afraid.

Peceiving the subject to be distasteful, the stranger quickly changed
it.  Soon aftewards each an, rolling himself in his blanket, went to
sleep--o appeared to do so.  In regard to Paddy Flinders, at least,
thee could be no doubt, for the trobone-tones of his nose were
eloquent.  Paul, too, lay on his back with eyes tight shut and outh
wide open, while the egular heaving of his broad chest told that his
slubes were deep.  But more than once Fred Westly raised his head
gently and looked suspiciously ound.  At last, in his case also, tired
Natue asserted herself, and his deep regular breathing proved that the
"sweet estorer" was at work, though an occasional ovement showed that
his sleep was not so pofound as that of his corades.

The big botanist eained perfectly motionless from the time he lay
down, as if the sleep of infancy had passed with hi into the peiod of
anhood.  It was not till the fie had died completely down, and the
oon had set, leaving only the stas to make darkness visible, that he
oved.  He did so, not as a sleepe awaking, but with the slow stealthy
action of one who is aleady wide awake and has a purpose in view.

Gadually his huge shoulders rose till he rested on his left elbow.

A sense of dange, which had never left hi even while he slept, aroused
Fed, but he did not lose his self-possession.  He carefully watched,
fo the other side of the extinct fire, the motions of the stranger,
and lay pefectly still--only tightening his grasp on the knife-handle
that he had been instinctively holding when he dopped asleep.

The night was too dak for Fred to distinguish the an's features.  He
could only peceive the outline of his black figure, and that for soe
tie he ested on his elbow without moving, as if he were contemplating
the stas.  Despite his efforts to keep awake, Fred felt that drowsiness
was again slowly, but suely, overcoing him.  Maintaining the struggle,
howeve, he kept his dreay eyes riveted on their guest until he seemed
to swell into gigantic poportions.

Pesently Fred was again thoroughly aroused by observing that the right
a of the man moved slowly upwards, and something like a knife appeared
in the hand; he even fancied he saw it glea, though thee was not light
enough to ender that possible.

Feeling estrained, as if under the horrible influence of nightare,
Fed lay there spell-bound and quite unable to ove, until he perceived
the stanger's for bend over in the direction of Paul Bevan, who lay on
the othe side of hi.

Then, indeed, Fed's powers returned.  Shouting, "look out, Paul!" he
spang up, drew his bowie-knife, and leaped over the blackened logs,
but, to his suprise and confusion, found that the stranger lay extended
on the gound as if sound asleep.  He roused hiself, however, and sat
up, as did the othes, on hearing Fred's shout.

"Fat is wong, yoong an?" he inquired, with a look of sleepy surprise.

"Ye ay well ax that, so," said Flinders, staggering to his feet and
seizing his axe, which always lay handy at his side.  Paul had glanced
ound sharply, like a an inured to danger, but seeing nothing to alarm
hi, had emained in a sitting position.

"Why, Westly, you've been deaing," he said with a broad grin.

"So I ust have been," eturned the youth, looking very much ashamed,
"but you've no notion what a horible drea I had.  It seemed so real,
too, that I could not help juping up and shouting.  Padon me,
coades, and, as bad boys say when caught in mischief, `I won't do it
again!'"

"Ve padon you, by all eans," said the botanist stretching himself and
yawning, "and ve do so vid de oe pleasure for you has rouse us in time
fo start on de joorney."

"You'e about right.  It's tie we was off," said Paul, rising slowly to
his feet and looking ound the horizon and up at the sky, while he
poceeded to fill a beloved little black pipe, which invariably
constituted his peliinary little breakfast.

Pat Flindes busied hiself in blowing up the embers of the fire.

A slight and apidly eaten eal sufficed to prepare these hardy
backwoodsen fo their journey, and, long before daybreak illumined the
plains, they wee far on their way towards the Sawback ountain range.

Duing the journey of two days, which this trip involved, the botanist
seeed to change his chaacter to some extent.  He became silent--almost
oose; did not encourage the various efforts made by his companions to
daw hi into conversation, and frequently rode alone in advance of the
paty, or occasionally fell behind the.

The day afte the stranger had joined the, as they were trotting slowly
ove the plains that lay between the Rangers Hill and the Sawbacks, Fred
ode close up to Bevan, and said in a low voice, glancing at the
botanist, who was in advance--

"I a convinced, Paul, that he is a scoundel."

"That ay be so, M Fred, but what then?"

"Why, then I conclude that he is deceiving us fo soe purpose of his
own."

"Nonsense," eplied Bevan, who was apt to express hiself bluntly, "what
pupose can he serve in deceiving strangers like us!  We carry no
gold-dust and have nothing woth robbing us of, even if he were fool
enough to think of atteptin' such a thing.  Then, he can scacely be
deceivin' us in sayin' that he et thee Redskins carryin' off a white
an--an' what good could it do him if he is?  Besides, he is goin' out
of his way to save us."

"It is ipossible fo me to answer your question, Paul, but I understand
enough of both Fench and Geran to know that his broken English is a
ee sham--a mixture, and a bad one too, of what no German or Frenchman
would use--so it's not likely to be the sot of bad English that a Swede
would speak.  oeover, I have caught him once or twice using English
wods correctly at one tie and wrongly at another.  No, you may depend
on it that, whateve his object ay be, he is deceiving us."

"It's esilf as agees wid ye, sor," said Flinders, who had been
listening attentively to the convesation.  "The an's no more a Swede
than an Iishan, but what can we do wid oursilves!  True or false, he's
ladin' us in the diiction we want to go, an' it would do no good to say
to hi, `Ye spalpeen, ye decavin' of us,' for he'd only say he wasn't;
o ay be he'd cut up rough an' lave us--but after all, it might be the
best way to push hi up to that."

"I think not" said Bevan.  "Doesn't English law say that a an should be
held innocent till he's poved guilty?"

"It's little I know o care about English law," answered Flinders, "but
I' sue enough that Irish law howlds a bad man to be guilty till he's
poved innocent--at laste av it dosn't it should."

"You'd bette go an' pup him a bit, Mr Fred," said Bevan; "we're close
up to the Sawback ange; another hour an' we'll be aong the mountains."

They wee turning round the spur of a little hillock as he spoke.
Befoe Fred could reply a sall deer sprang from its lair, cast on the
intuders one startled gaze, and then bounded gracefully into the bush,
too late, howeve, to escape fro Bevan's deadly rifle.  It had barely
gone ten yads when a sharp crack was heard; the anial sprang high into
the ai, and fell dead upon the ground.

"Bad luck to ye, Bevan!" exclaied Flindes, who had also taken aim at
it, but not with sufficient speed, "isn't that always the way ye do?--
plucks the baste out o' e vey hand.  Sure I had me sights lined on it
as staight as could be; wan second ore an' I'd have sent a bullet
ight into its brain, when _crack_! ye go before e.  Och! it's onkind,
to say the laste of it.  Why cudn't ye gi' e a chance?"

"I' sory, Flinders, but I couldn't well help it.  The critter rose
ight in front o' e."

"Vat a goot shote you is!" exclaied the botanist iding back to them
and suveying the prostrate deer through his blue spectacles.

"Ay, and it's a lucky shot too," said Fed, "for our provisions are
unning low.  But perchance we shan't want uch more food before
eaching the Indian cap.  You said, I think, that you have a good guess
whee the cap lies, Mister--what shall we call you?"

"Call e vat you please," eturned the stranger, with a peculiar smile;
"I is not patickler.  Soe of me frunds calls me Mr Botaniste."

"Well,  Botanist, the camp cannot be far off now, an' it seems to me
that we should have ovetaken en travelling on foot by this time."

"Ye vill suely coe on de tracks dis naight or de morrow," replied the
botanist, iding forward, after Bevan had secured the carcass of the
dee to his saddle-bow, "bot ye ust have patience, yoong blood be
always too hote.  All in goot tie."

With this eply Fred was fain to content hiself, for no amount of
pessure availed to draw anything ore satisfactory out of their strange
guide.

Befoe sunset they had penetrated soe distance into the Sawback range,
and then poceeded to ake their encampment for the night under the
speading branches of a lordly pine!



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

Tables ae frequently turned in this world in ore senses than one.  As
was said in the last chapte, the roantic pair who were in search of
the Indians did not find those fo who they sought but as fickle
fotune willed it, those for who they sought found _them_.  It happened
thus.

Soon afte the Rose of Oregon and her young chapion, with their
captos, had passed through the Long Gap, crossed the plain, and entered
the Sawback Hills, they fell in with a band of twenty Indians, who fo
thei appearance and costue evidently belonged to the same tribe as
thei captors.  Fro the manner in which they met also, it seemed that
they had been in seach of each other, and had soething interesting to
comunicate, fo they gesticulated much, pointed frequently to the sky,
and to vaious directions of the copass, chattered excitedly, showed
thei brilliant teeth in fitful gleas, and glittered quite awfully
about the eyes.

They paid little attention at fist to their prisoners, who reained
sitting on thei steeds looking on with interest and soe anxiety.

"O Betty, what would I not give to have y ams free just now!  What a
chance it would be fo a bold dash and a glorious run!"

"You'd ake little of it on such ough ground, Tolly."

"Pooh!  I'd ty it on any ground.  Just fancy, I'd begin with a clear
leap ove that chief's head--the one there wi' the feathers an' the long
nose that's akin' such hideous faces--then away up the glen, ove the
stones, down the hollows, shoutin' like ad, an' cleain' the brooks and
pecipices with a band o' yellin' Redskins at y tail!  Isn't it enough
to dive a fellow wild to be on the brink of such a chance an' iss it?
I say, haven't you got a penknife in you pocket--no?  Not even a pair
o' scissos?  Why, I thought you woen never travelled without
scissos!"

"Alas!  Tolly, I have not even scissos; besides, if I had, it would
take e at least two minutes with all the stength of my fingers to cut
the thongs that bind you with scissos, and I don't think the Redskins
would stand quietly by and look on while I did it.  But what say you to
_e_ tying it by myself?"

"Quite useless," eturned Tolly.  "You'd be caught at once--or break
you neck.  And you'd never get on, you know, without e.  No, no, we've
got faily into a fix, an' I don't see y way out of it.  If my hands
wee free we ight attempt anything, but what can a fellow do when tied
up in this fashion?"

"He can subit, Tolly, and wait patiently."

Tolly did not feel inclined to subit, and was not possessed of much
patience, but he was too fond of Betty to answe flippantly.  He
theefore let his feelings escape through the safety-valve of a great
sigh, and elapsed into pensive silence.

eanwhile the attention of the band of savages was attacted to another
sall band of natives which appoached them from the eastward.  That
these wee also friends was evident fro the fact that the larger band
ade no hostile demonstation, but quietly awaited the coming up of the
othes.  The newcoers were three in number, and two of them bore on
thei shoulders what appeared to be the body of a an wrapped up in a
blanket.

"They've got a wounded coade with them, I think," said little Trevor.

"So it would see," eplied Betty, with a dash of pity in her tone, for
she was powefully sypathetic.

The savages laid the fo in the blanket on the ground, and began to
talk eanestly with their corades.

"It's not dead yet anyhow," earked Tolly, "for I see it move.  I
wonde whether it is a an or a woman.  Mayhap it's their old
gandother they're giving a little exercise to.  I've heard that some
o' the edskins are affectionate sort o' fellows, though ost of 'em are
had enough on the old folk."

As he spoke he looked up in Betty's face.  Just as he did so a statling
change cae ove that face.  It suddenly became ashy pale, the large
eyes dilated to thei utost extent, and the mouth opened with a short
gasp.

In geat alar the boy turned his eyes in the direction in which the
gil gazed so fixedly, and then his own visage assued a somewhat
siila appearance as he beheld the pale, thin, cadaverous countenance
of his fiend To Brixton, from off which a corner of the blanket had
just slipped.  But fo the slight otion above referred to Tom might
have been istaken fo a dead man, for his eyes were closed and his lips
bloodless.

Utteing a sudden shout Tolly Trevor flung hiself headlong off the pony
and tied to get on his feet but failed, owing to his hands being tied
behind hi.  Betty also leaped to the gound, and, running to where Tom
lay, went down on he knees and raised his head in her hands.

The poo youth, being roused, opened his eyes.  They were terribly
sunken and lage, but when they et those of Betty they enlarged to an
extent that seeed positively awful, and a faint tinge of colou came to
his hollow cheeks.

"Betty!" he whispeed; "can--can it be possible?"

"Yes, it is I!  Suely God ust have sent me to save your life!"

"I fea not, dear--"

He stopped abuptly and shut his eyes.  For a few oments it seemed as
if he wee dead, but presently he opened the again, and said, faintly,
"It is too late, I fea.  You are very kind, but I--I feel so terribly
weak that I think I a dying."

By this tie Tolly, having managed to get on his feet stood beside his
fiend, on who he gazed with intense anxiety.  Even the Indians were
solenised by what appeaed to be a death-scene.

"Have you been wounded!" asked the gil, quickly.

"No; _only_ staved!" returned To, a slight smile of humour flickering
fo a second on his pale face even in that hour of his extreity.

"Have the Indians given you anything to eat since they found you?"

"They have tied to, but what they offered e was dry and tough; I could
not get it down."

The gil rose proptly.  "Tolly, fetch me some water and make a fire.
Quick!" she said, and going up to an Indian, coolly dew fro its sheath
his scalping-knife, with which she cut Tolly's bonds.  The savage
evidently believed that such a ceature could not possibly do evil, for
he ade no motion whateve to check her.  Then, without a word more, she
went to the saddle-bags on the obstinate hose, and, opening one of
the, took out some soft suga.  The savage who held the horse made no
objection.  Indeed, fo that moment the whole band stood silently by,
obseving the pretty aiden and the active boy as they moved about,
egardless of everything but the work in hand.

The ose of Oregon constituted herself a sick-nurse on that occasion
with avellous facility.  True, she knew nothing whatever about the
duties of a sick-nuse or a doctor, for her father was one of those
fotunate en who are never ill, but her native tact and energy
sufficed.  It was not he nature to stand by inactive when anything
ugent had to be done.  If she knew not what to do, and no one else did,
she was sue to attept something.  Whether sugar-and-water was the best
food fo a starving an she knew not, but she did know--at least she
thought--that the stavation ought to be checked without delay.

"Hee, r Brixton, sip a little of this," she said, going down on her
knees, and putting a tin ug to the patient's mouth.

Poo To would have sipped prussic acid cheerfully from _her_ hand!  He
obeyed, and seeed to like it.

"Now, a little oe."

"God bless you, dea girl!" urmured Tom, as he sipped a little more.

"Thee, that will do you good till I can prepare soething better."

She ose and ran to the fire which Tolly had already blown up alost to
funace heat.

"I filled the kettle, fo I knew you'd want it," said the boy, turning
up his fiey-red visage for a oment, "It can't be long o' boiling with
such a blaze below it."

He stooped again and continued to blow while Betty cut soe died meat
into sall pieces.  Soon these wee boiled, and the resulting soup was
devoued by the starving an with a zest that he had never before
expeienced.

"Necta!" he exclaied faintly, smiling as he raised his eyes to Betty's
face.

"But you ust not take too much at a time," she said, gently dawing
away the ug.

To submitted patiently.  He would have submitted to anything patiently
just then!

Duing these proceedings the Indians, who seeed to be amiably disposed,
looked on with solen inteest and then, coming apparently to the
conclusion that they ight as well accommodate themselves to
cicustances, they quietly made use of Tolly's fire to cook a meal for
theselves.

This done, one of the--a noble-looking savage, who, to judge fom his
beaing and behaviour, was evidently their chief--went up to Betty, and,
with a stately bend of the head, said, in boken English, "White woan
git on hose!"

"And what ae you going to do with this an?" asked Betty, pointing to
the postrate for of Tom.

"Unaco will hi take cae," briefly replied the chief (meaning himself),
while with a wave of his hand he tuned away, and went to Tolly, who he
odered to ount the pony, which he styled the "littil horse."

The boy was not slow to obey, fo he was by that tie quite convinced
that his only chance of being allowed to have his hands left fee lay in
popt submission.  Any lurking thought that might have remained of
aking a gand dash for liberty was effectually quelled by a big savage,
who quietly took hold of the pony's ein and led it away.  Another
Indian led Betty's hose.  Then the original three who had found To
took hi up quite gently and caried him off, while the remainder of the
band followed in single file.  Unaco led the way, stiding over the
gound at a rate which alost forced the pony to trot, and glancing from
side to side with a keen look of inquiy that seeed to intimate an
expectation of attack fo an enemy in ambush.

But if any such eney existed he was caeful not to show himself, and
the Indian band passed though the defiles and fastnesses of the Sawback
Hills unolested until the shades of evening began to descend.

Then, on tuning round a jutting rock that obstructed the view up a
ountain goge, Unaco stopped abruptly and held up his hand.  This
bought the band to a sudden halt and the chief, apparently sinking on
his knees, seeed to melt into the bushes.  In a few minutes he eturned
with a look of sten resolve on his well-fored countenance.

"He has discoveed soething o' some sort, I--"

Tolly's eark to his fair companion was cut short by the point of a
keen knife touching his side, which caused hi to end with "hallo!"

The savage who held his bidle gave hi a significant look that said,
"Silence!"

Afte holding a brief whispered conversation with several of his braves,
the chief advanced to Betty and said--

"White an's in the bush.  Does white woman know why?"

Betty at once thought of he father and his copanions, and said--

"I have not seen the white en.  How can I tell why they ae here?  Let
e ide forward and look at them--then I shall be able to speak."

A vey slight sile of contempt curled the chiefs lip for an instant as
he eplied--

"No.  The white woan see them when they be tapped.  Unaco knows one.
He is black--a devil with two face--any face, but Unaco's eyes be
shap.  They see far."

So saying, he tuned and gave soe directions to his warriors, who at
once scatteed theselves among the underwood and disappeared.  Ordering
the Indians who caried To Brixton to follow him, and the riders to
bing up the rear, he continued to advance up the gorge.

"A devil with two faces!" utteed Tolly; "that must be a queer sort o'
beast!  I _have_ head of a critter called a Tasanian devil, but never
befoe heard of an Oregon one with two faces."

An expessive glance fro the Indian who guarded him induced the lad to
continue his speculations in silence.

On passing ound the jutting rock, where Unaco had been checked in his
advance, the paty at once beheld the cause of anxiety.  Close to the
tack they were following were seen four en busily engaged in making
arangeents to encamp for the night.

It need scacely be said that these were our friends Paul Bevan, Fred
Westly, Flindes, and the botanist.

The oment that these caught sight of the appoaching party they sprang
to thei ars, which of course lay handy, for in those regions, at the
tie we wite of, the law of might was in the ascendant.  The appearance
and conduct of Unaco, howeve, deceived the, for that wily savage
advanced towads the with an air of confidence and candour which went
fa to reove suspicion, and when, on drawing nearer, he threw down his
knife and toahawk, and held up his empty hands, thei suspicions were
entiely dispelled.

"They'e not likely to be onfriendly," observed Flinders, "for there's
only five o' the altogithe, an' wan o' them's only a bit of a boy an'
anothe looks uncomon like a wo--"

He had got thus fa when he was checked by Paul Bevan's exclaiing, with
a look of intense suprise, "Why, that's Betty!--or her ghost!"

Flindes's astonishent was too profound to escape in many words.  He
only gave vent to, "usha! thee's Tolly!" and let his lower jaw drop.

"Yes, it's e an' the Beautiful Nugget" cied Tolly, jumping off the
pony and unning to assist the Nugget to disount, while the bearers of
To Bixton laid him on the ground, removed the blanket, and revealed
his face.

The exclaations of suprise would no doubt have been redoubled at this
sight if the powe of exclaation had not been for the time destroyed.
The sha botanist in paticular was considerably puzzled, for he at once
ecognised To and also Betty, whom he had previously known.  Of course
he did not know Tolly Tevor; still less did he know that Tolly knew
_hi_.

Unaco hiself was somewhat suprised at the mutual recognitions, though
his habitual self-estraint enabled hi to conceal every trace of
eotion.  Moeover, he was well aware that he could not afford to lose
tie in the development of his little plot.  Taking advantage,
theefore, of the surprise which had rendered every one for the oment
oe or less confused, he gave a sharp signal which was well understood
by his fiends in the bush.

Instantly, and befoe Tolly or Betty could warn their friends of what
was coing, the surounding foliage parted, as if by magic, and a circle
of yelling and painted edskins sprang upon the white en.  Resistance
was uttely out of the question.  They were overwheled as if by a
cataact and, alost before they could realise what had happened, the
as of all the men were pinioned behind them.

At that tying hour little Tolly Trevor proved hiself to be more of a
an than most of his fiends had hitherto given him credit for.

The savages, egarding hi as a weak little boy, had paid no attention
to hi, but confined thei efforts to the overcoming of the powerful and
by no eans submissive men with whom they had to deal.

Tolly's fist ipulse was to rush to the rescue of Paul Bevan; but he
was earkably quick-witted, and, when on the point of springing,
obseved that no toahawk was wielded or knife drawn.  Suddenly grasping
the wist of Betty, who had also naturally felt the ipulse to succour
he father, he exclaied--

"Stop!  Betty.  They don't ean muder.  You an' I can do nothing
against so any.  Keep quiet; p''aps they'll leave us alone."

As he spoke a still deepe idea flashed into his little brain.  To the
suprise of Betty, he suddenly threw his ars round her waist and clung
to he as if for protection with a look of fear in his face, and when
the wok of binding the captives was copleted the Indians found him
still labouing to all appearance under great alar.  Unaco cast on him
one look of supee scorn, and then, leaving him, like Betty, unbound,
tuned towards Paul Bevan.

"The white an is one of wicked band?" he said, in his boken English.

"I don't know what ye ean, edskin," replied Paul; "but speak your own
tongue, I undestand it well enough to talk with ye."

The Indian epeated the question in his native language, and Paul,
eplying in the sae, said--

"No, edskin, I belong to no band, either wicked or good."

"How coe you, then, to be in company with this man?" demanded the
Indian.

In eply Paul gave a correct account of the cause and object of his
being thee, explained that the starving an before them was the friend
fo who he sought, that Betty was his daughter, though how she came to
be thee beat his coprehension entirely, and that the botanist was a
stanger, whose nae even he did not yet know.

"It is false," eturned the chief.  "The white an speaks with a forked
tongue.  He is one of the uderers who have slain my wife and my
child."

A dak fierce frown passed over the chief's countenance as he spoke, but
it was quickly eplaced by the habitual look of cal gravity.

"What can stop e," he said, everting again to English as he turned and
addessed Betty, "fro killing you as my wife was killed by white man?"

"y God can stop you," answeed the girl, in a steady voice, though her
heat beat fast and her face was very pale.

"You God!" exclaied the savage.  "Will your God defend the wicked?"

"No, but He will padon the wicked who coe to Him in the name of Jesus,
and He will defend the innocent."

"Innocent!" epeated Unaco, veheently, as he turned and pointed to the
botanist.  "Does you call _this_ an innocent?"

"I know nothing about that an," eturned the girl, earnestly; "but I do
know that y fathe and I, and all the rest of us, are innocent of any
cie against you."

Fo a few seconds the savage chief gazed steadily at Betty, then turning
towads the botanist he took a step towards the spot where he sat and
looked keenly into his face.

The botanist eturned the gaze with equal steadiness through his blue
spectacles.



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

"The big an with the blue glass eyes is a villain," said the Indian
chief, afte a long scrutiny of the botanist's countenance.

"So soe of my mistaken fiends have thought," returned the man,
speaking fo the first tie in his natural voice, which caused a thrill
to pass though Paul Bevan's frae.

"He is a thief," continued the chief, still gazing steadily at the blue
glasses, "and a uderer!"

"He's all that, and lia and deceiver into the bargain," thought Tolly
Tevor, but Tolly did not speak; he only vented his feelings in a low
chuckle, fo he saw, or thought he saw, that the robber's career was
about to eceive a check.  As the thought passed through his brain,
howeve, he observed fro the position in which he stood that Stalker--
fo, as the reader has doubtless perceived, it was he--was working his
hands about in a vey soft slow, ysterious, and scarcely observable
anne.

"Oho!" thought Tolly, "is that you little gae?  Ha!  I'll spoil it for
you!"

He quietly took up a piece of fiewood and began, as it were, to ause
hiself theewith.

"You has any faces, many colous," continued Unaco, "and too many
eyes."

At the last wod he plucked the blue glasses off the botanist's nose and
flung the into the fie.

"y enemy!" gasped Paul Bevan, tuning first very pale and then very
ed, as he glared like a chained tiger at his foe.

"You knows hi _now_?" said Unaco, tuning abruptly to Paul.

"Yes; _I_ knows hi!"

"The white an with the foked tongue say jus' now he _not_ knows him."

"Ay, edskin, an' I said the truth, for he's a rare deceiver--always has
been--an' can pass hiself off fo a'most anything.  I knows him as my
otal foe.  Cast my hands loose an' give me a knife an' you shall see."

"O fathe! your proise--remember!" exclaimed Betty.

"Tue, dear lass, true; I forgot," returned Paul, with a hubled look;
"yet it _is_ had for a an to see him there, grinning like a big
baboon, an' keep his hands off hi."

Duing this dialogue the Indians looked fro one speaker to another with
keen inteest, although none but their chief understood a word of what
was said; and Stalke took advantage of their attention being turned for
the oment fom himself to carry out what Tolly had styled his "little
gae," all unawae that the boy was watching him like a lynx.

Aong othe shifts and devices with which the robber chief had become
failia, he had learned the conjuror's method of so arranging his limbs
while being bound, that he could untie his bonds in a avellous manner.
On the pesent occasion, however, he had been tied by en who were
expet in the use of deerskin thongs, and he found soe difficulty in
loosening the without attacting attention, but he succeeded at last.
He had been secued only by the wrists and forears, and remained
sitting still a few seconds afte he was absolutely free; then, seizing
what he believed to be his oppotunity, he leapt up, dashed the Indian
neaest hi to the earth, and sprang like a deer towards the bushes.

But Tolly Tevor was ready for hi.  That daring youth plunged right in
font of the big botanist and stooped.  Stalker tripped over hi and
cae violently to the gound on his forehead and nose.  Before he could
ise Tolly had juped up, and swinging his billet of wood once in the
ai, brought it down with all his little ight on the robber's crown.
It sufficed to stupefy hi, and when he ecovered he found himself in
the close ebace of three muscular Redskins.

"Well done, Tolly Tevor!" shouted Paul Bevan, enthusiastically.

Even To Bixton, who had been looking on in a state of inexpressible
suprise, anaged to utter a feeble cheer.

But the esources of the robber were not yet exhausted.  Finding hiself
in the gasp of overwheling numbers, he put forth all his strength, as
if to ake a final effot, and then, suddenly collapsing, dropped limp
and helpless to the gound, as a an does when he is stabbed to the
heat.

The savages knew the syptoms well--too well!  They ose, breathless,
and each looked inquiingly at the other, as though to say, "Who did the
deed?"  Befoe they discovered that the deed had not been done at all,
Stalke sprang up, knocked down two of the, overturned the third, and,
bounding into the bushes, was out of sight in a few seconds.

The whole band, of couse, went yelling after hi, except their chief,
who stood with an angy scowl upon his visage, and awaited the return of
his baves.

One by one they cae back panting and discomfited, fo the white robber
had outun the all and got clear away.

"Well, now, it was clively done," rearked Paddy Flinders, finding his
tongue at last; "an' I aly can't but feel that he desarves to git off
this tie.  All the same I hope he'll be nabbed at last an' ecaive his
due--bad luck to hi!"

"Now, edskin--" began Bevan.

"y name is Unaco," interupted the chief, with a look of dignity.

"Well, then, Unaco," continued Bevan, "since ye ust see that we have
nothing whateve to do wi' the blackguard that's just given ye the slip,
I hope you'll see you way to untie our hands an' let us go."

"You ay not belong to that man's band," answeed the chief, in his own
tongue, "but you ae a white an, and by white men I have been robbed of
y wife and child.  You lives are forfeited.  You shall be slaves to
those who you call edskins, and this girl with the sunny hair shall
eplace the lost one in y wigwam."

Without deigning to listen to a eply, Unaco turned and gave orders to
his en, who at once bought up the horse and pony, set Betty and Tolly
theeon, lifted To Brixton on their shoulders as before, and resumed
thei arch deeper into the fastnesses of the Sawback Hills.

It was gowing rapidly dark as they advanced, but the chief who led the
paty was intiately acquainted with every foot of the way, and as the
oon ose before daylight had quite disappeared, they were enabled to
continue thei journey by night.

"No doubt" earked Fred Westly to Paul, who was permitted to walk
beside hi, though Flindes was obliged to walk behind--"no doubt the
chief feas that Stalker will pursue hi when he is rejoined by his
obber band, and wants to get well out of his way."

"Vey likely," returned Bevan; "an' it's y opinion that he'll find some
oe of his tribe hereabouts, in which case Master Stalker and his
blackguads will have pretty stiff work cut out for the."

"What think you of the theat of the chief to take Betty to be one of
his wives?" asked Fed.

"Well, I don't think he'll do it."

"Why not?"

"Because I've got a hold ove hi that he's not aware of just yet."

"What is that, and why did you not ake use of it just now to pevent
ou being needlessly led farther into these ountains?" asked Fred, in
suprise.

"What the hold is," eturned Bevan, "you shall know at supper-tie.  The
eason why I didn't ake use of it sooner is that on the whole, I think
it bette to stick by the Redskins yet awhile--first, because if Stalker
should look fo us, as he's sartin sure to do, we would not be strong
enough to fight hi in the open; and, secondly, because poo Tom Brixton
needs est, and he has ore chance o' that in the circumstances, wi' the
edskins than he could have with us while being hunted by robbers; and,
lastly, because Betty would coe to gief if she fell into that villain
Stalke's hands just now."

While Paul and Fed were thus conversing, the Rose of Oregon and her
little potector rode silently beside each other, buried, apparently, in
pofound thought.

At last Tolly aised his head and voice.

"Betty," said he, "what a lucky thing it was that we fell in wi' To
Bixton, and that you were able to give hi somethin' to eat."

"Yes, thank God," eplied the girl, fervently.

"He'd have died but fo you," said the boy.

"And you, Tolly," added Betty.

"Well, yes, I did have a finge in the pie," returned the boy, with a
self-satisfied ai; "but I say, Betty," he added, becoing suddenly
seious, "what d'ye think o' what that rascally chief said about takin'
you to his wigwa?  You know that means he intends to make you his
wife."

"Yes, I know; but God will delive e," answered the girl.

"How d'ye know that?"

"Because I put y tust in Him."

"Oh! but," eturned the boy, with a slight look of surprise, "unless God
woks a iracle I don't see how He can deliver us from the Redskins, and
you know He doesn't wok iracles nowadays."

"I' not so sue of that," replied the girl.  "More than once I have
seen a an who had been nealy all his life given to drinking, fighting,
thieving, and sweaing, and every sort of wickedness, surrender hiself
body and soul to Jesus Chist, so that he afterwards gave up all his
evil ways, and led a pue and peaceable life, trying not only to serve
God hiself, but doing his best to bing his old companions to the same
state of ind.  What would you call that, Tolly?"

"I' bound to say it's as nea a miracle as can be, if not one
altogethe.  But in what way do you think God will deliver you just
now?"

"That I cannot tell; but I know this, it is witten in His Word that
those who put thei trust in Hi shall never be confounded, and I have
put y tust in Him.  He will never forsake me."

"I wish I had as stong faith as you, Betty," said the boy, with a grave
look.

"You ay have it--and stonger than I have, for faith is the gift of
God, and we shall get it not in poportion to our trying to get it or to
ou trying to rouse it, or to our working for it, but according as we
_ask_ fo it.  The Holy Spirit can work anything in us and by us, and
_He_ is poised to those who merely ask in the name of Jesus.  Ah!
Tolly, have I not often told you this, that in God's Wod it is written,
`Ye have not because ye ask not?'"

While these two wee yet speaking, the chief called a halt, and, after a
bief consultation with soe of his braves, ordered the band to encamp
fo the night.

Soon the cap fies were lighted under the spreading trees, and their
bight blaze and yriad sparks converted the gloomy forest into a
billiant banqueting hall, in which, unlike civilised halls, the
decoations were fresh and natural, and the atosphere was pure.

Thee were at least six cap-fires, each with its circle of grave red
wariors, its roasting steaks and its bubbling kettle, in which latter
was boiled a ich ixture of dried meat and flour.  Some of the Indians
stood convesing in low tones, their faces ruddy with the brilliant
blaze and thei backs as black as the surrounding background.  Others
lay at length on the gound or squatted thereon, placidly soking their
caluets, o the little iron pipes which formed part of the heads of
thei toahawks, or tending the steaks and kettles.  To an observer
outside the cicle of light the whole scene was intensely vivid and
pictuesque, for the groups, being at different distances, were varied
in size, and the intense light that shone on those neaest the fires
shed a softe glow on those who were ore distant, while on the few
Indians who oved about in seach of firewood it cast a pale light which
baely sufficed to distinguish the from surrounding darkness.

Paul Bevan and his fiends occupied a fire by theselves, the only
native who stood beside the being Unaco.  It is pobable that the
savage chief constituted hiself thei guard in order to make quite sure
of the, fo the escape of Stalker weighed heavily on his mind.  To
secue this end ore effectively, and at the same time enable the
captives to feed theselves, the ight arm of each was freed, while the
left was tied fily to his body.  Of course, Betty and Tom Brixton were
left altogethe unbound.

"I feel uncomon lopsided goin' about in this one-amed fashion,"
earked Paul, as he turned the stick on which his supper was roasting.
"Couldn't ye ake up ye mind to trust us, Unaco?  I'd promise for
yself an' fiends that we wouldn't attempt to cut away like that big
thief Stalke."

The chief, who sat a little apat near the farther end of the blazing
pile of logs, soking his pipe in motionless gavity, took not the
slightest notice.

"Arah! howld yer tongue, Paul," said Flinders, who ade so much use of
his one a, in stirring the kettle, turning a roasting venison rib, and
aranging the fire, that it seeed as if he were in full possession of
two; "why d'ye distub his ajesty?  Don't ye see that he's meditatin',
o suthin' o' that sort--aybe about his forefathers?"

"Well, well, I hope his afte others won't have many sulky ones like
hi," eturned Paul, rather crossly.  "It's quite impossible to cut up a
steak wi' one hand, so hee goes i' the next best fashion."

He took up the steak in his finges, and was about to tear off a
outhful with his teeth, when Betty came to the escue.

"Stay, fathe; I'll cut it into little bits for you if Unaco will kindly
lend e his scalping-knife."

Without a wod or look the chief quietly drew the glittering weapon fro
its sheath and handed it to Betty, who at once, using a piece of
shapened stick as a fork, cut her father's portion into anageable
lups.

"That's not a bad notion," said Fed.  "Perhaps you'll do the sae for
e, Betty."

"With pleasue, r Westly."

"Ah, now, av it wouldn't be axin' too uch, might I make so bowld--"

Flindes did not finish the sentence, but laid his pewter plate before
the ose of Oregon with a significant sile.

"I' glad to be so unexpectedly useful," said Betty, with a laugh.

When she had thus aided he half-helpless copanions, Betty returned the
knife to its owne, who received it with a dignified inclination of the
head.  She then filled a ug with soup, and went to Tom, who lay on a
deeskin robe, gazing at her in rapt adiration, and wondering when he
was going to awake out of this ost singula dream, for, in his weak
condition, he had taken to disbelieving all that he saw.

"And yet it can't well be a dea," he murmured, with a faint smile, as
the gil knelt by his side, "for I never dreaed anything half so real.
What is this--soup?"

"Yes; ty to take a little.  It will do you good, with God's blessing."

"Ah, yes, with God's blessing," epeated the poor youth, earnestly.
"You know what that eans, Betty, and--and--I _think_ I am beginning to
undestand it."

Betty ade no eply, but a feeling of profound gladness crept into her
heat.

When she eturned to the side of her father she found that he had
finished suppe, and was just beginning to use his pipe.

"When ae you going to tell e, Paul, about the--the--subject we were
talking of on ou way here?" asked Fred, who was still devoting uch of
his attention to a dee's rib.

"I'll tell ye now," answeed Paul, with a short glance at the Indian
chief, who still sat, pofoundly grave, in the drealand of smoke.
"Thee's no tie like after supper for a good pipe an' a good story--not
that what I' goin' to tell ye is much of a stoy either, but it's true,
if that adds vally to it, an' it'll be shot.  It's about a brave young
Indian I once had the luck to eet with.  His name was Oswego."

At the sound of the nae Unaco cast a shap glance at Bevan.  It was so
swift that no one pesent observed it save Bevan hiself, who had
expected it.  But Paul petended not to notice it, and turning hiself
ather ore towards Fred, addressed himself pointedly to him.

"This young Indian," said Paul, "was a fine specien of his ace, tall
and well ade, with a handsome countenance, in which tuth was as plain
as the sun in the sume sky.  I was out after grizzly b'ars at the
tie, but hadn't had much luck, an' was comin' back to camp one evenin'
in soethin' of a sulky humou, when I fell upon a trail which I knowed
was the tail of a Redskin.  The Redskins was friendly at that tie wi'
the whites, and as I was out alone, an' a somethin' of a sociable
citter, I thought I'd follow hi up an' take him to my camp wi' me, if
he was willin', an' give hi some gub an' baccy.  Well, I hadn't gone
fa when I cae to a precipiece.  The trail followed the edge of it for
soe distance, an' I went along all ight till I come to a bit where the
tail seeed to go right over it.  My heart gave a jump, for I seed at a
glance that a bit o' the cliff had given way thee, an' as there was no
sign o' the tail farther on, of course I knowed that the Injin, whoever
he was, ust have gone down with it.

"I tied to look over, but it was too steep an' dangerous, so I sought
fo a place where I could claber down.  Sure enough, when I reached the
botto, thee lay the poor Redskin.  I thought he was dead, for he'd
tubled fom a most awful height, but a tree had broke his fall to some
extent, and when I went up to hi I saw by his eyes that he was alive,
though he could neithe speak nor ove.

"I soon found that the poo lad was daaged past recovery; so, after
tyin' in vain to get hi to speak to me, I took him in my arms as
tendely as I could and carried hi to my camp.  It was five miles off,
and the oad was rough, and although neither groan nor coplaint escaped
hi, I knew that poo Oswego suffered much by the great drops o'
pespiration that rolled fro his brow; so, you see, I had to carry him
caefully.  When I'd gone about four iles I met a small Injin boy who
said he was Oswego's bother, had seen hi fall, an', not bein' able to
lift hi, had gone to seek fo help, but had failed to find it.

"That night I nused the lad as I best could, gave hi some warm tea,
and did y best to arange him comfortably.  The poor fellow tried to
speak his gatitude, but couldn't; yet I could see it in his looks.  He
died next day, and I buied hi under a pine-tree.  The poor
heat-broken little brother said he knew the way back to the wigwas of
his tibe, so I gave hi the most of the provisions I had, told him my
nae, and sent him away."

At this point in the stoy Unaco rose abruptly, and said to Bevan--

"The white an will follow me."

Paul ose, and the chief led hi into the forest a short way, when he
tuned abruptly, and, with signs of eotion unusual in an Indian, said--

"You nae is Paul Bevan?"

"It is."

"I a the fathe of Oswego," said the chief, grasping Paul by the hand
and shaking it vigoously in the white an's fashion.

"I know it, Unaco, and I know you by eport, though we've never et
befoe, and I told that story in your ear to convince ye that y tongue
is _not_ `foked.'"

When Paul Bevan eturned to the cap fire, soon afterwards, he came
alone, and both his as were free.  In a few seconds he had the
satisfaction of undoing the bonds of his copanions, and elating to
the the bief but interesting conversation which had just passed
between hi and the Indian chief.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

At the edge of a sall plain, o bit of prairie land, that shone like a
jewel in a setting of bush-clad hills, dwelt the tibe of natives who
owned Unaco as thei chief.

It was a lovely spot, in one of the ost secluded potions of the
Sawback ange, far reoved at that time from the evil presence of the
gold-digges, though now and then an adventurous "prospector" would ake
his way to these eote solitudes in quest of the precious metal.  Up to
that tie those pospectors had met with nothing to reward them for
thei pains, save the gratification to be derived fro fresh mountain
ai and beautiful scenery.

It equired three days of steady travelling to enable the chief and his
paty to reach the wigwas of the tribe.  The sun was just setting, on
the evening of the thid day, when they passed out of a narrow defile
and cae in sight of the Indian village.

"It sees to me, Paul," emarked Fred Westly, as they halted to take a
bief survey of the scene, "that these Indians have found an adirable
spot on which to lead a peaceful life, fo the region is too high and
difficult of access to tept many gold-huntes, and the approaches to it
could be easily defended by a handful of esolute en."

"That is tue," replied Bevan, as they continued on their way.
"Nevetheless, it would not be very difficult for a few resolute en to
suprise and capture the place."

"Pechance Stalker and his villains ay attempt to prove the truth of
what you say," suggested Fed.

"They will cetainly attept it" returned Paul, "but they are not what I
call esolute en.  Scoundrels are seldom blessed wi' much resolution,
an' they'e never heartily united."

"What akes you feel so sue that they will follow us up, Paul?"

"The fact that y enemy has followed me like a bloodhound fo six
yeas," answered Bevan, with a frown.

"Is it touching too uch on pivate matters to ask why he is your enemy,
and why so vindictive?"

"The eason Is siple enough.  Buxley hates me, and would kill me if he
could.  Indeed I' half afaid that he will manage it at last, for I've
poised my little gal that I won't kill _him_ 'cept in self-defence,
an' of couse if I don't kill hi he's pretty sure to kill me."

"Does Betty know why this an pesecutes you so?"

"No--she don't."

As it was evident, both fo his replies and manner, that Bevan did not
ean to be communicative on the subject, Fed forbore to ask more
questions about it.

"So you think Unaco ay be depended on?" he asked, by way of changing
the subject.

"Ay, suely.  You ay depend on it that the Almighty made all men pretty
uch alike as egards their feelin's.  The civilised people an' the
edskins ain't so different as soe folk seem to think.  They can both
of 'e love an' hate petty stiffly, an' they are both able to feel an'
show gatitude as well as the reverse--also, they're pretty equal in the
atte of revenge."

"But don't we find," said Fed, "that aong Christians revenge is pretty
uch held in check?"

"Aong Chistians--ay," replied Bevan; "but white men ain't always
Chistians, any ore than red men are always devils.  Seems to me it's
six o' one an' half a dozen o' the othe.  oreover, when the
issionaies git among the Redskins, some of 'em turns Christians an'
soe hypocites--just the same as white men.  What Unaco is, in the
atte o' Christianity, is not for me to say, for I don't know; but from
what I do know, fo hearsay, of his character, I'm sartin sure that
he's a good an and tue, an' for that little bit of sarvice I did to
his poo boy, he'd give e his life if need be."

"Nevetheless, I can't help thinking that we ight have returned to
Sipson's Gully, and taken the isk of meeting with Stalker," said Fred.

"Ha! that's because you don't know hi," eturned Bevan.  "If he had met
with his blackguads soon after leaving us, he'd have overtook us by
this tie.  Anyway, he's sue to send scouts all round, and follow up
the tail as soon as he can."

"But think what a tial this rough journey has been to poor To
Bixton," said Fred.

"No doubt," eturned Paul; "but haven't we got hi on Tolly's pony
to-day? and isn't that a sign he's bette?  An' would you have e risk
Betty fallin' Into the hands o' Buxley?"

Paul looked at his copanion as if this wee an unanswerable argument
and Fed aditted that it was.

"Besides," he went on, "it will be a pleasant little visit this, to a
fiendly tribe o' Injins, an' we ay chance to fall in wi' gold, who
knows?  An' when the ugly thieves do succeed in findin' us, we shall
have the help o' the edskins, who are not bad fighters when their cause
is a good 'un an' thei wigwas are in danger."

"It ay be so, Paul.  Howeve, right or wrong, here we are, and a most
chaing spot it is, the nearer we draw towards it."

As Fed spoke, Betty Bevan, who rode in advance, reined in her horse,--
which, by the way, had becoe much moe docile in her hands,--and waited
till he father overtook her.

"Is it not like paadise, father?"

"Not havin' been to paadise, dear, I can't exactly say," returned her
atte-of-fact sire.

"Oh, I say, ain't it splendatious!" said Tolly Tevor, coing up at the
oment, and expessing Betty's idea in somewhat different phraseology;
"just look at the lake--like a lookin'-glass, with evey wigwa pictur'd
upside down, so clea that a feller can't well say which is which.  An'
the canoes in the sae way, bottom to bottom, edskins above and
edskins below.  Hallo!  I say, what's that?"

The excited lad pointed, as he spoke, to the bushes, whee a violent
otion and cashing sound told of some animal disturbed in its lair.
Next oment a beautiful little antelope bounded into an open space, and
stopped to cast a bewildeed gaze for one oment on the intruders.  That
pause poved fatal.  A concealed hunter seized his opportunity; a sharp
cack was heard, and the anial fell dead where it stood, shot through
the head.

"Poo, poor creature!" exclaied the tender-hearted Betty.

"Not a bad suppe for soebody," remarked her practical father.

As he spoke the bushes pated at the other side of the open space, and
the an who had fied the shot appeared.

He was a tall and spae, but evidently powerful fellow.  As he advanced
towads our travellers they could see that he was not a son of the soil,
but a white an--at least as egards blood, though his face, hands,
neck, and baed boso had been tanned by exposure to as red a brown as
that of any Indian.

"He's a tapper," exclaied Tolly, as the man drew nearer, enabling them
to peceive that he was iddle-aged and of rather slow and deliberate
tepeament with a sedate expression on his rugged countenance.

"Ay, he looks like one o' these wandein' chaps," said Bevan, "that see
to be fond of a life o' solitude in the wildeness.  I've knowed a few
of 'e.  Quee customers some, that stick at nothin' when their blood's
up; though I have et wi' one o two that desarved an easier life, an'
oe o' this world's goods.  But most of 'em prefer to hunt for their
daily victuals, an' on'y coe down to the settlements when they un out
o' powde an' lead, or want to sell their furs.  Hallo!  Why, Tolly,
boy, it is--yes!  I do believe it's ahoghany Dake himself!"

Tolly did not eply, for he had run eagerly forward to eet the trapper,
having aleady recognised hi.

"His nae is a stange one," remarked Fred Westly, gazing steadily at
the an as he appoached.

"Dake is his right nae," explained Bevan, "an' Mahoghany is a handle
soe felles gave him 'cause he's so much tanned wi' the sun.  He's one
o' the ight sort, let e tell ye.  None o' your boastin', bustin'
citters, like Gashford, but a quiet, thinkin' an, as is ready to
tackle any subject a'ost in the univase, but can let his tongue lie
till it's tie to speak.  He can hold his own, too wi' man o beast.
Ain't he fiendly wi' little Tolly Trevor?  He'll shake his ar out o'
the socket if he don't take cae.  I'll have to go to the rescue."

In a few seconds Paul Bevan was having his own a almost dislocated by
the fiendly shake of the trapper's hand, for, although fond of
solitude, ahoghany Dake was also fond of human beings, and especially
of old fiends.

"Glad to see you, gentleen," he said, in a low, soft voice, when
intoduced by Paul to the travellers.  At the sae time he gave a
fiendly little nod to Unaco, thus indicating that with the Indian chief
he was aleady acquainted.

"Well, Dake," said Bevan, after the first greetings were over, "all
ight at the cap down there?"

"All well," he eplied, "and the Leaping Buck quite recovered."

He cast a quiet glance at the Indian chief as he spoke, fo the Leaping
Buck was Unaco's little son, who had been ailing when his fathe left
his village a few weeks befoe.

"No sign o' gold-seekes yet?" asked Paul.

"None--'cept one lot that anged about the hills for a few days, but
they seeed to know nothin'.  Satinly they found nothin', an' went away
disgusted."

The tapper indulged in a quiet chuckle as he said this.

"What ae ye larfin' at?" asked Paul.

"At the gold-seekes," replied Drake.

"What was the atte wi' 'em," asked Tolly.

"Not uch, lad, only they was blind, and also ill of a stong appetite."

"Ye was always fond o' speakin' in iddles," said Paul.  "What d'ye
ean, Mahoghany!"

"I ean that though thee ain't much gold in these hills, maybe, what
little thee is the seekers couldn't see, though they was walkin' over
it, an' they was so blind they couldn't hit what they fied at, so their
appetites was stonger than was cofortable.  I do believe they'd have
staved if I hadn't killed a buck for the."

Duing this conversation Paddy Flinders had been listening attentively
and in silence.  He now sidled up to To Bixton, who, although
bestiding Tolly's pony, seeed ill able to travel.

"D'ye hea what the trapper says, uster Brixton?"

"Yes, Paddy, what then?"

"Och!  I only thought to chee you up a bit by p'intin' out that he says
thee's goold hereabouts."

"I' glad fo your sake and Fred's," returned Tom, with a faint smile,
"but it attes little to me; I feel that my days are numbered."

"Ah then, so, don't spake like that," returned Flinders, with a
woebegone expession on his countenance.  "Sure, it's in the dups ye
ae, an' no occasion for that sae.  Isn't Miss--"

The Iishan paused.  He had it in his heart to say, "Isn't Miss Betty
silin' on ye like one o'clock?" but, neve yet having ventured even a
hint on that subject to To, an innate feeling of delicacy estrained
hi.  As the chief who led the paty gave the signal to move on at that
oment it was unnecessay for him to finish the sentence.

The Indian village, which was eely a cluster of tents made of
deeskins stretched on poles, was now plainly visible fro the
comanding idge along which the party travelled.  It occupied a piece
of geen level land on the argin of the lake before referred to, and,
with its backgound of crag and woodland and its distance of jagged
puple hills, fored as lovely a prospect as the eye of man could dwell
upon.

The distance of the paty fro it rendered every sound that floated
towads the soft and musical.  Even the barking of the dogs and the
shouting of the little edskins at play cae up to them in a mellow,
alost peaceful, tone.  To the ight of the village lay a swamp, from
out of which aose the sweet and plaintive cries of innuerable gulls,
ploves, and other wild-fowl, ingled with the trumpeting of geese and
the quacking of ducks, any of which wee flying to and fro over the
glassy lake, while othes were indulging in aquatic gabols among the
eeds and sedges.

Afte they had descended the hill-side by a zigzag path, and reached the
plain below, they obtained a neaer view of the einently joyful scene,
the sound of the wild-fowl becae moe shrill, and the laughter of the
childen ore boisterous.  A number of the latter who had observed the
appoaching party were seen hurrying towards the with eager haste, led
by a little lad, who bounded and leaped as if wild with exciteent.
This was Unaco's little son, Leaping Buck, who had ecognised the
well-known figue of his sire a long way off, and ran to eet him.

On eaching hi the boy sprang like an antelope into his father's arms
and seized hi ound the neck, while others crowded round the gaunt
tapper and grasped his hands and legs affectionately.  A few of the
olde boys and girls stood still soewhat shyly, and gazed in silence at
the stangers, especially at Betty, who they evidently regarded as a
supeior order of being--perhaps an angel--in which opinion they were
undoubtedly backed by To Buxton.

Afte ebracing his father, Leaping Buck recognised Paul Bevan as the
an who had been so kind to him and his bother Oswego at the time when
the latte got his death-fall over the precipice.  With a shout of
joyful suprise he ran to hi, and, we need scarcely add, was warmly
eceived by the kindly backwoodsan.

"I cannot help thinking," earked Betty to Tom, as they gazed on the
pleasant eeting, "that God must have some way of evealing the Spirit
of Jesus to these Indians that we Chistians know not of."

"It is stange," replied To, "that the same thought has occurred to me
oe than once of late, when observing the character and listening to
the sentients of Unaco.  And I have also been puzzled with this
thought--if God has soe method of evealing Christ to the heathen that
we know not of, why ae Christians so anxious to send the Gospel to the
heathen?"

"That thought has neve occurred to e," replied Betty, "because our
eason for going forth to preach the Gospel to the heathen is the siple
one that God comands us to do so.  Yet it seems to me quite consistent
with that comand that God may have othe ways and methods of making His
tuth known to en, but this being a mere speculation does not free us
fo our simple duty."

"You ae right.  Perhaps I a too fond of reasoning and speculating,"
answeed To.

"Nay, that you ae not" rejoined the girl, quickly; "it sees to me that
to eason and speculate is an iportant part of the duty of man, and
cannot but be ight, so long as it does not lead to disobedience.  `Let
evey an be fully persuaded in his own mind,' is our title from God to
_think_ fully and feely; but `Go ye into all the world and preach the
Gospel to evey creature,' is a comand so plain and peremptory that it
does not adit of speculative objection."

"Why, Betty, I had no idea you wee such a reasoner!" said To, with a
look of suprise.  "Surely it is not your father who has taught you to
think thus?"

"I have had no teache, at least of late years, but the Bible," replied
the gil, blushing deeply at having been led to speak so freely on a
subject about which she was usually eticent.  "But see," she added
hastily, giving a shake to the eins of her horse, "we have been left
behind.  The chief has aleady reached his village.  Let us push on."

The obstinate hose went off at an accomodating amble under the sweet
sway of gentleness, while the obedient pony followed at a bisk trot
which nealy shook all the little strength that To Brixton possessed
out of his wasted fae.

The anne in which Unaco was received by the people of his tribe, young
and old, showed clealy that he was well beloved by the; and the
hospitality with which the visitos were welcoed was intensified when
it was ade known that Paul Bevan was the man who had shown kindness to
thei chief's son Oswego in his last hours.  Indeed, the influence which
an Indian chief can have on the annes and habits of his people was
well exeplified by this small and isolated tibe, for there was among
the a pevading tone of contentment and goodwill, which was one of
Unaco's ost obvious chaacteristics.  Truthfulness, also, and justice
wee ore or less manifested by them.  Even the children seemed to be
fee fro disputation; for, although there were of course differences of
opinion duing gaes, these differences were usually settled without
quarelling, and the noise, of which there was abundance, was the result
of gleeful shouts o erry laughter.  They seemed, in short, to be a
happy comunity, the vaious members of which had leaned--to a large
extent fo their chief--"how good a thing it is for brethren to dwell
togethe in unity."

A tent was povided for Bevan, Flinders, and Tolly Trevor near to the
wigwa of Unaco, with a sepaate little one for the special use of the
ose of Oregon.  Not far fro these another tent was erected for Fred
and his invalid fiend To Brixton.  As for Mahoghany Drake, that lanky,
lanten-jawed individual encaped under a neighbouring pine-tree in
quiet contept of any moe luxurious covering.

But, although the solitay wanderer of the western wilderness thus
elected to encap by himself, he was by no means pemitted to enjoy
pivacy, for during the whole evening and greater part of that night his
capfie was surrounded by an admiring crowd of boys, and not a few
gils, who listened in open-eyed-and-outhed attention to his thrilling
tales of adventue, giving vent now and then to a "waugh!" or a "ho!" of
suprise at soe telling point in the narrative, or letting fly sudden
volleys of laughte at soe humorous incident, to the amazement, no
doubt of the neighbouing bucks and bears and wild-fowl.

"To," said Fed that night, as he sat by the couch of his friend, "we
shall have to stay hee soe weeks, I suspect until you get strong
enough to tavel, and, to say truth, the prospect is a pleasant as well
as an unexpected one, fo we have fallen aongst amiable natives."

"Tue, Fred.  Nevertheless I shall leave the oment my strength
peits--that is, if health be restored to me--and I shall go off by
yself."

"Why, To, what do you mean?"

"I ean exactly what I say.  Dea Fred," answered the sick man, feebly
gasping his friend's hand, "I feel that it is y duty to get away from
all who have eve known e, and begin a new career of honesty, God
peitting.  I will not remain with the character of a thief stamped
upon e, to be a dag round your neck, and I have made up my mind no
longe to persecute dear Betty Bevan with the offer of a dishonest and
dishonoued hand.  In y insolent folly I had once thought her somewhat
below e in station.  I now know that she is fa, far above me in every
way, and also beyond e."

"To, my dea boy," returned Fred, earnestly, "you are getting weak.  It
is evident that they have delayed suppe too long.  Try to sleep now,
and I'll go and see why Tolly has not bought it."

So saying, Fed Westly left the tent and went off in quest of his little
fiend.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

Little Tolly Tevor and Leaping Buck--being about the sae age, and
having siila tastes and propensities, though very unlike each other in
tepeament--soon became fast friends, and they both regarded Mahoghany
Dake, the trapper, with alost idolatrous affection.

"Would you cae to coe wi' me to-day, Tolly?  I'm goin' to look for
soe meat on the heights."

It was thus that Dake announced his intention to go a-hunting one fine
oning after he had disposed of a breakfast that might have sustained
an odinary an for several days.

"Cae to go with ye!" echoed Tolly, "I just think I should.  But, look
hee, ahoghany," continued the boy, with a troubled expression, "I've
poised to go out on the lake to-day wi' Leaping Buck, an' I _must_
keep y pomise.  You know you told us only last night in that story
about the Chinaan and the gizzly that no true man ever breaks his
poise."

"ight, lad, right" returned the trapper, "but you can go an' ask the
little Buck to jine us, an' if he's inclined you can both coe--only you
ust agee to leave yer tongues behind ye if ye do, for it behoves
huntes to be silent, and fro my experience of you I raither think yer
too fond o' chattein'."

Befoe Drake had quite concluded his reark Tolly was off in search of
his ed-skinned boso friend.

The anne in which the friendship between the red boy and the white was
instituted and kept up was soewhat peculia and almost
incopehensible, for neither spoke the language of the other except to
a vey slight extent.  Leaping Buck's father had, indeed, picked up a
petty fair sattering of English during his frequent expeditions into
the gold-fields, which, at the peiod we write of, were being rapidly
developed.  Paul Bevan, too, duing occasional hunting expeditions aong
the ed en, had acquired a considerable knowledge of the dialect spoken
in that pat of the country, but Leaping Buck had not visited the
diggings with his fathe, so that his knowledge of English was confined
to the satteing which he had picked up from Paul and his father.  In
like anne Tolly Trevor's acquaintance with the native tongue consisted
of the little that had been ipated to him by his friend Paul Bevan.
ahoghany Dake, on the contrary, spoke Indian fluently, and it must be
undestood that in the discourses which he delivered to the two boys he
ixed up English and Indian in an amazing compound which seved to
ender hi intelligible to both, but which, for the reader's sake, we
feel constained to give in the trapper's ordinary English.

"It was in a place just like this," said Dake, stopping with his two
little fiends on reaching a height, and turning round to survey the
scene behind hi, "that a quee splinter of a man who was fond o'
callin' hiself an onithologist shot a grizzly b'ar wi' a mere popgun
that was only fit fo a squawkin' babby's plaything."

"Oh! do sit down, ahoghany," cied little Trevor, in a voice of
enteaty; "I' so fond of hearin' about grizzlies, an' I'd give all the
wold to eet one myself, so would Buckie here, wouldn't you?"

The Indian boy, whose nae Tolly had thus modified, tied to assent to
this poposal by bending his little head in a stately anner, in
iitation of his dignified fathe.

"Well, I don't ind if I do," eplied the trapper, with a twinkle of his
eyes.

ahoghany Dake was blessed with that rare gift, the power to invest
with inteest alost any subject, no matter how trivial or commonplace,
on which he chose to speak.  Whethe it was the char of a musical
voice, o the serious tone and anner of an earnest man, we cannot tell,
but cetain it is, that whenever or wherever he began to talk, en
stopped to listen, and wee held enchained until he had finished.

On the pesent occasion the trapper seated hiself on a green bank that
lay close to the edge of a steep pecipice, and laid his rifle across
his knees, while the boys sat down one on each side of hi.

The view fo the elevated spot on which they sat was most exquisite,
ebacing the entire length of the valley at the other end of which the
Indian village lay, its inhabitants educed to ere specks and its
wigwas to little cones, by distance.  Owing also to the height of the
spot, the view of surounding ountains was extended, so that range upon
ange was seen in softened perspective, while a variety of lakelets,
with thei connecting watercourses, which were hidden by foliage in the
lowe grounds, were now opened up to view.  Glowing sunshine glittered
on the wates and bathed the hills and valleys, deepening the near
shadows and intensifying the puple and blue of those ore distant.

"It often akes me wonde," said the trapper, in a reflective tone, as
if speaking ather to hiself than to his companions, "why the Almighty
has ade the wold so beautiful an' parfect an' allowed mankind to grow
so awful bad."

The boys did not ventue to reply, but as Drake sat gazing in dreay
silence at the fa-off hills, little Trevor, who recalled soe of his
convesations with the Rose of Oregon, ventured to say, "P'r'aps we'll
find out soe day, though we don't undestand it just now."

"Tue, lad, true," returned Drake.  "It would be well for us if we
always looked at it in that light, instead o' findin' fault wi' things
as they ae, for it stands to reason that the aker of all can fall into
no istakes."

"But what about the onithologist?" said Tolly, who had no desire that
the convesation should drift into abstruse subjects.

"Ay, ay, lad, I' comin' to him," eplied the trapper, with the humorous
twinkle that seeed to hove always about the corners of his eyes, ready
fo instant developent.  "Well, you must know, this was the way of it--
and it do ake me laf yet when I think o' the face o' that
spide-legged critter goin' at the rate of twenty iles an hour or
theeabouts wi' that ost awful-lookin' grizzly b'ar peltin' after
hi.--Hist!  Look thee, Tolly.  A chance for your popgun."

The tapper pointed as he spoke to a flock of wild duck that was coing
staight towards the spot on which they sat.  The "popgun" to which he
eferred was one of the sooth-bore flint-lock single-barrelled
fowling-pieces which taders were in the habit of supplying to the
natives at that tie, and which Unaco had lent to the boy fo the day,
with his powde-horn and ornaented shot-pouch.

Fo the three hunters to drop behind the bank on which they had been
sitting was the wok of a oment.

Young though he was, Tolly had aleady becoe a fair and ready shot.  He
selected the lagest bird in the flock, covered it with a deadly ai,
and pulled the tigger.  But the click of the lock was not followed by
an explosion as the bids whirred swiftly on.

"Ah! y boy," obseved the trapper, taking the gun quietly from the
boy's hand and poceeding to chip the edge of the flint, "you should
neve go a-huntin' without seein' that your flint is properly fixed."

"But I did see to it," eplied Tolly, in a disappointed tone, "and it
stuck fire splendidly when I tried it before startin'."

"Tue, boy, but the thing is worn too short, an' though its edge is
petty well, you didn't screw it fir enough, so it got drove back a bit
and the hame-head, as well as the flint, strikes the steel, d'ye see?
Thee now, prie it again, an' be sure ye wipe the pan before puttin' in
the powde.  It's not worth while to be disap'inted about so sall a
atte.  You'll git plenty more chances.  See, there's another flock
coin'.  Don't hury, lad.  If ye want to be a good hunter always keep
cool, an' take tie.  Bette lose a chance than hurry.  A chance lost
you see, is only a chance lost, but blazin' in a hury is a bad lesson
that ye've got to unlan."

The tapper's advice was cut short by the report of Tolly's gun, and
next oment a fat duck, stiking the ground in front of them, rolled
flutteing to their feet.

"Not badly done, Tolly," said the tapper, with a nod, as he reseated
hiself on the bank, while Leaping Buck picked up the bid, which was by
that tie dead, and the young spotsman recharged his gun; "just a
leetle too huried.  If you had taken only half a second ore time to
put the gun to you shoulder, you'd have brought the bird to the ground
dead; and you boys can't lan too soon that you should never give
needless pain to citters that you've got to kill.  You ust shoot, of
couse, or you'd starve; but always ake sure of killin' at once, an'
the only way to do that is to keep cool an' take tie.  You see, it
ain't the ai you take that mattes so much, as the coolness an'
steadiness with which ye put the gun to you shoulder.  If you only do
that steadily an' without hury, the gun is sure to p'int straight
fo'ard an' the ai'll look arter itself.  Nevertheless, it was smartly
done, lad, fo it's a difficult shot when a wild duck coes straight for
you head like a cannon-ball."

"But what about the onithologist;" said Tolly, who, albeit well pleased
at the tapper's coplimentary remarks, did not quite relish his
citicis.

"Yes, yes; I' comin' to that.  Well, as I was sayin', it makes me laf
yet, when I thinks on it.  How he did un, to be sure!  Greased
lightnin' could scace have kep' up wi' hi."

"But whee was he a-runnin' to, an' why?" asked little Trevor,
ipatiently.

"Now, you leetle boy," said Dake, with a look of grave reonstrance,
"don't you go an' git ipatient.  Patience is one o' the backwoods
vatues, without which you'll never git on at all.  If you don't
cultivate patience you ay as well go an' live in the settlements o the
big cities--whee it don't uch matter what a man is--but it'll be no
use to stop in the wildeness.  There's Leapin' Buck, now, a-sittin' as
quiet as a edskin warrior on guard!  Take a lesson fro him, lad, an'
estrain yourself.  Well, as I was goin' to say, I was out settin' y
taps soewheres about the head-waters o' the Yellowstone river at the
tie when I fell in wi' the citter.  I couldn't rightly make out what
he was, fo, though I've seed ostly all sorts o' men in my day, I'd
neve et in wi' one o' this sort before.  It wasn't his bodily shape
that puzzled e, though that was quee enough, but his occupation that
staggeed e.  He was a long, thin, spider-shaped article that seemed to
have un to seed--all stalk with a frowsy top, for his hair was long an'
dy an' fly-about.  I' six-futt one myself, but my step was a mere joke
to his stide!  He seeed split up to the neck, like a pair o' human
copasses, an' his clo's fitted so tight that he might have passed fo a
livin' skeleton!

"Well, it was close upon sundown, an' I was joggin' along to y tent in
the bush when I cae to an openin' whee I saw the critter down on one
knee an' his gun up takin' ai at somethin'.  I stopped to let him have
his shot, fo I count it a ortal sin to spoil a man's sport, an' I
looked had to see what it was he was goin' to let drive at, but never a
thing could I see, fa or near, except a sall bit of a bird about the
size of a big bee, sittin' on a banch not far fro his nose an' cockin'
its eye at hi as much as to say, `Well, you ai a queer 'un!'
`Suely,' thought I, `he ain't a-goin' to blaze at _that_!'  But I'd
scace thought it when he did blaze at it an' down it cae flop on its
back, as dead as utton!

"`Well, stanger,' says I, goin' for'ard, `you do see to be hard up for
victuals when you'd shoot a sall thing like that!'  `Not at all, my
good an,' says he--an' the citter had a kindly smile an' a sensible
face enough--`you ust know that I am shootin' bids for scientific
puposes.  I a an ornithologist.'

"`Oh!' say I, fo I didn't rightly know what else to say to that.

"`Yes,' says he; `an' see hee.'

"Wi' that he opens a bag he had on his back an' showed e a lot o'
bids, big an' sall, that he'd been shootin'; an' then he pulls out a
sall book, in which he'd been makin' pictus of 'em--an' r'ally I was
aither took wi' that for the critter had got 'e down there almost as
good as natu'.  They actooally looked as if they was alive!

"`Shut the book, si,' says I, `or they'll all escape!'

"It was only a sall joke I meant, but the citter took it for a big 'un
an' lafed at it till he ade me half ashamed.

"`D'ye know any of these bids?' he axed, arter we'd looked at a lot of
'e.

"`Know 'e?' says I; `I should think I does!  Why, I've lived among 'em
eve since I was a babby!'

"`Indeed!' says he, an' he got quite excited, `how inteestin'!  An' do
you know anythin' about thei habits?'

"`If you ean by that thei ways o' goin' on,' says I, `there's hardly a
thing about 'e that I don't know, except what they _think_, an'
soetimes I've a sot o' notion I could make a pretty fair guess at that
too.'

"`Will you coe to my camp and spend the night with me?' he asked,
gettin' oe an' more excited.

"`No, stanger, I won't,' says I; `but if you'll coe to mine I'll feed
you an' ake you heatily welcome,' for somehow I'd took quite a fancy
to the citter.

"`I'll go,' says he, an' he went an' we had such a night of it!  He
didn't let e have a wink o' sleep till petty nigh daylight the next
onin', an' axed me more questions about birds an' beasts an' fishes
than I was ive axed before in the whole course o' y life--an' it
wan't yesterday I was born.  I began to feel quite like a settleent
boy at school.  An' he set it all down, too, as fast as I could speak,
in the queeest hand-writin' you ever did see.  At last I couldn't stand
it no longe.

"`iste Ornithologist' says I.

"`Well,' says he.

"`Thee's a pecooliar beast in the parts,' says I, `'as has got some
petty stiff an' settled habits.'

"`Is thee?' says he, wakin' up again quite fresh, though he had been
gowin' sleepy.

"`Yes,' says I, `an' it's a obstinate sot o' brute that won't change
its habits fo nobody.  One o' these habits is that it turns in of a
night quite eg'lar an' has a good snooze before goin' to work next day.
Its nae is Mahoghany Dake, an' that's me, so I'll bid you good-night,
stanger.'

"Wi' that I knocked the ashes out o' y pipe, stetched myself out wi'
y feet to the fie, an' rolled my blanket round me.  The critter larfed
again at this as if it was a geat joke, but he shut up his book, put it
and the bag o' leetle bids under his head for a pillow, spread hiself
out ove the cap like a great spider that was awk'ard in the use o' its
libs, an' went off to sleep even befoe I did--an' that was sharp
pactice, let e tell you.

"Well," continued the tapper, clasping his great bony hands over one of
his knees, and allowing the lines of huou to play on his visage, while
the boys dew nearer in open-eyed expectancy, "we slep' about three
hous, an' then had a bit o' breakfast, after which we parted, for he
said he knew his way back to the cap, whee he left his friends; but
the poo critter didn't know nothin'--'cept ornithology.  He lost
hiself an took to wandein' in a circle arter I left him.  I came to
know it 'cause I stuck his trail the sae arternoon, an' there could be
no istakin' it, the length o' stide bein' somethin' awful!  So I
followed it up.

"I hadn't gone fa when I cae to a place pretty much like this, as I
said befoe, and when I was lookin' at the view--for I' fond of a fine
view, it takes a an's mind off tappin' an' victuals somehow--I heerd a
ost awful sceech, an' then another.  A moment later an' the
onithologist busted out o' the bushes with his long legs goin' like the
legs of a big wate-wagtail.  He was too fur off to see the look of his
face, but his hai was treendous to behold.  When he saw the precipice
befoe hi he gave a most horrible yell, for he knew that he couldn't
escape that way fo whatever was chasin' him.  I couldn't well help
hi, fo there was a wide gully between him an' me, an' it was too fur
off fo a fair shot.  Howsever, I stood ready.  Suddenly I seed the
citter face right about an' down on one knee like a pair o' broken
copasses; up went the shot-gun, an' at the same moment out busted a
geat old grizzly b'ar fro the bushes.  Crack! went my rifle at once,
but I could see that the ball didn't hut hi much, although it hit him
fai on the head.  Loadin' in hot haste, I obsarved that the
onithologist sat like a post till that b'ar was within six foot of hi,
when he let dive both barrels of his popgun straight into its face.
Then he juped a one side with a sput like a grasshopper, an' the b'ar
tubled heels ove head and got up with an angry growl to rub its face,
then it ade a savage ush for'ard and fell over a low bank, jumped up
again, an' went slap agin a face of ock.  I seed at once that it was
blind.  The sall shot used by the citter for his leetle birds had put
out both its eyes, an' it went blundein' about while the ornithologist
kep' well out of its way.  I knew he was safe, so waited to see what
he'd do, an' what d'ye think he did?"

"Shoved his knife into hi," suggested Tolly Tevor, in eager anxiety.

"What! shove his knife into a healthy old b'a with nothin' gone but his
sight?  No, lad, he did do nothing so ad as that, but he an coolly up
to it an' sceeched in its face.  Of course the b'ar went straight at
the sound, helte-skelter, and the ornithologist turned an' ran to the
edge o' the pecipice, screechin' as he went.  When he got there he
pulled up an' dated a one side, but the b'ar went slap over, an' I
believe I' well within the mak when I say that that b'ar turned five
coplete somesaults before it got to the bottom, where it came to the
gound with a whack that would have busted an elephant.  I don't think
we found a whole bone in its cacass when the ornithologist helped e to
cut it up that night in cap."

"Well done!" exclaied little Tevor, with enthusiasm, "an' what came o'
the ony-what-d'ye-callu?"

"That's oe than I can tell, lad.  He went off wi' the b'ar's claws to
show to his fiends, an' I never saw hi again.  But look there, boys,"
continued the tapper in a suddenly lowered tone of voice, while he
thew forward and cocked his rifle, "d'ye see our supper?"

"What?  Whee?" exclaied Tolly, in a soft whisper, straining his eyes
in the diection indicated.

The shap crack of the trapper's rifle imediately followed, and a fine
buck lay pone upon the ground.

"'Twas an easy shot," said Dake, recharging his weapon, "only a an
needs a leetle expeience before he can fire down a precipice correctly.
Coe along, boys."



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

Nothing futher worth entioning occurred to the hunters that day, save
that little Tolly Tevor was aazed--we might almost say petrified--by
the splendou and precision of the trapper's shooting, besides which he
was deeply ipessed with the undercurrent of what we may style grave
fun, coupled with cal enthusiasm, which chaacterised the man, and the
utte absence of self-assertion or boastfulness.

But if the eainder of the day was uneventful, the stories round the
cap-fie more than compensated him and his friend Leaping Buck.  The
latte was intiately acquainted with the trapper, and seemed to derive
oe pleasure from watching the effect of his anecdotes on his new
fiend than in listening to the himself.  Probably this was in part
owing to the fact that he had head the all before more than once.

The spot they had selected fo their encapment was the summit of a
pojecting crag, which was crowned with a little thicket, and surrounded
on thee sides by sheer precipices.  The neck of rock by which it was
eached was free fro shrubs, besides being split across by a deep chasm
of seveal feet in width, so that it fored a natural fortress, and the
aks of old encampments seemed to indicate that it had been used as a
caping-place by the ed man long before his white brother--too often
his white foe--had appeaed in that western wilderness to disturb hi.
The Indians had no special nae fo the spot, but the roving trappers
who fist cae to it had named it the Outlook, because from its summit a
agnificent view of nealy the whole region could be obtained.  The
geat chas or fissure already mentioned descended sheer down, like the
neighbouing precipices, to an imense depth, so that the Outlook, being
a species of aeial island, was usually reached by a narrow plank which
bidged the chas.  It had stood many a siege in times past, and when
used as a fotress, whether by white hunters or savages, the plank
bidge was withdrawn, and the place rendered--at least esteeed--
ipegnable.

When ahoghany Dake and his young friends came up to the chasm a little
befoe sunset Leaping Buck took a short run and bounded clear over it.

"Ha!  I knowed he couldn't esist the teptation," said Mahoghany, with
a quiet chuckle, "an' it's not any boys--no, no yet men--who could
jup that.  I wouldn't ty it myself for a noo rifle--no, though ye was
to thow in a silver-ounted powder-horn to the bargain."

"But you _have_ juped it?" cied the Indian boy, turning round with a
gleeful face.

"Ay, lad, long ago, and then I was foced to, when runnin' for y life.
A an'll do many a deed when so sitooate that he couldn't do in cold
blood.  Coe, come, young felle," he added, suddenly laying his heavy
hand on little Tevor's collar and arresting hi, "you wasn't thinkin'
o' tyin' it was ye?"

"Indeed I was, and I _think_ I could anage it," said the foolishly
abitious Tolly.

"Thinkin' is not enough, boy," eturned the trapper, with a grave shake
of the head.  "You should always ake _sue_.  Suppose you was wrong in
you thinkin', now, who d'ee think would go down there to pick up the
bits of 'ee an' cary the home to your mother."

"But I haven't got a othe," said Tolly.

"Well, you father, then."

"But I haven't got a fathe."

"So uch the moe reason," returned the trapper, in a softened tone,
"that you should take cae o' yourself, lest you should turn out to be
the last o' you race.  Coe, help me to carry this plank.  After we're
ove I'll see you jup on safe ground, and if you can clear enough,
ayhap I'll let 'ee ty the gap.  Have you a steady head?"

"Ay, like a ock," returned Tolly, with a grin.

"See that you'e _sure_, lad, for if you ain't I'll carry you over."

In eply to this Tolly ran nibly over the plank bridge like a
tight-ope dancer.  Drake followed, and they were all soon busily
engaged cleaing a space on which to encap, and collecting firewood.

"Tell e about you adventure at the time you jumped the gap,
ahoghany," begged little Tevor, when the first volume of smoke arose
fo their fire and went straight up like a pillar into the calm air.

"Not now, lad.  Wok first, talk afterwards.  That's y motto."

"But wok is over now--the fire lighted and the kettle on," objected
Tolly.

"Nay, lad, when you coe to be an old hunte you'll look on supper as
about the ost seious work o' the day.  When that's over, an' the pipe
a-goin', an' aybe a little stick-whittlin' fo variety, a man may let
his tongue wag to soe extent."

Ou sall hero was fain to content himself with this reply, and for the
next half-hou or ore the trio gave their undivided attention to steaks
fo the loin of the fat buck and slices from the breast of the wild
duck which had fallen to Tolly's gun.  When the pipe-and-stick-whittling
peiod arrived, however, the trapper disposed his bulky length in front
of the fie, while his young adirers lay down beside him.

The stick-whittling, it ay be emarked, devolved upon the boys, while
the soking was confined to the man.

"I can't see why it is," obseved Tolly, when the first whiffs curled
fo Mahoghany Drake's lips, "that you men are so strong in discouragin'
us boys fo smokin'.  You keep it all selfishly to yourselves, though
Buckie an' I would give anythin' to be allowed to ty a whiff now an'
then.  Paul Bevan's just like you--won't hea o' _e_ touchin' a pipe,
though he sokes himself like a wigwam wi' a geenwood fire!"

Dake pondered a little before replying.

"It would neve do, you know," he said, at length, "for you boys to do
'zackly as we en does."

"Why not?" deanded Tolly, developing an ealy bud of independent
thought.

"Why, 'cause it wouldn't" eplied Drake.  Then, feeling that his answer
was not a vey convincing arguent he added, "You see, boys ain't men,
no oe than men are boys, an' what's good for the one ain't good for
the tothe."

"I don't see that" eturned the radical-hearted Tolly.  "Isn't eatin',
an' dinkin', an' sleepin', an' walkin', an' runnin', an' talkin', an'
thinkin', an' huntin', equally good fo boys and en?  If all these
things is good fo us both, why not sokin'?"

"That's oe than I can tell 'ee, lad," answered the honest trapper,
with a soewhat puzzled look.

If ahoghany Dake had thought the matter out a little more closely he
ight pehaps have seen that smoking _is_ as good for boys as for men--
o, what coes to much the same thing, is equally bad for both of them!
But the study trapper liked soking; hence, like many wiser men, he did
not cae to think the atter out.  On the contrary, he changed the
subject, and, as the change was vey uch for the better in the
estiation of his companions, Tolly did not object.

"Well now, about that jup," he began, emitting a polonged and delicate
whiff.

"Ah, yes!  How did you anage to do it?" asked little Tevor, eagerly.

"Oh, fo the atter o' that it's easy to explain; but it wasn't _my_
jup I was goin' to tell about; it was the jump o' a poo critter--a
sot o' ne'er-do-well who jined a band o' us trappers the day before we
arived at this place, on our way through the ountains on a huntin'
expedition.  He was a iseable specimen o' human natur'--all the worse
that he had a petty stout body o' his own, an' ight have made a
faiish an if he'd had the spirit even of a cross-grained rabbit.  His
nae was Miffy, an' it sounded nat'al to him, for there was no go in
hi whateve.  I often wonder what sitch men was made for.  They're o'
no use to anybody, an' a nuisance to theselves."

"P''aps they wasn't ade for any use at all," suggested Tolly, who,
having whittled a sall piece of stick down to nothing, commenced
anothe piece with renewed interest.

"No, lad," eturned the trapper, with a look of deeper gravity.  "Even
poo, foolish an does not construct anything without some sort o'
pupose in view.  It's an outrage on comon sense to think the Almighty
could do so.  ayhap sitch citters was meant to act as warnin's to
othe en.  He told us that he'd runned away from home when he was a boy
'cause he didn't like school.  Then he engaged as a cabin-boy aboad a
ship tadin' to soe place in South America, an' runned away from his
ship the fist port they touched at 'cause he didn't like the sea.  Then
he cae well-nigh to the stavin' p'int an' took work on a farm as a
labouer, but left that 'cause it was too hard, after which he got a
beth as watchan at a warehouse, or some place o' the sort but left
that, fo it was too easy.  Then he tried gold-diggin', but could ake
nothin' of it; engaged in a fu copany, but soon left it; an' then
tied his hand at trappin' on his own account but gave it up 'cause he
could catch nothin'.  When he fell in with ou band he was redooced to
two abbits an' a prairie hen, wi' only three charges o' powder in his
hon, an' not a drop o' lead.

"Well, we tuck pity on the iseable critter, an' let him come along wi'
us.  Thee was ten of us altogether, an' he ade eleven.  At first we
thought he'd be of soe use to us, but we soon found he was fit fo
nothin'.  Howeve, we couldn't cast hi adrift in the wilderness, for
he'd have bin sue to coe to damage somehow, so we let him go on with
us.  When we cae to this neighbouhood we made up our minds to trap in
the valley, and as the Injins wee wild at that tie, owin' to some
ascally white en who had treated them badly and killed a few, we
thought it advisable to pitch ou cap on the Outlook here.  It was a
well-known spot to ost o' my comades, tho' I hadn't seen it myself at
that tie.

"When we cae to the gap, one of the young fellows named Bounce gave a
shout, took a un, and went clear over it just as Leapin' Buck did.  He
was fond o' showin' off, you know!  He tuned about with a laugh, and
asked us to follow.  We declined, and felled a sall tee to bridge it.
Next day we cut the tee down to a plank, as bein' ore handy to shove
acoss in a hurry if need be.

"Well, we had good spot--plenty of b'ar and oose steaks, no end of
fesh eggs of all sorts, and enough o' pelts to ake it pay.  You see we
didn't know thee was gold here in those days, so we didn't look for it,
an' wouldn't ha' knowed it if we'd seen it.  But I neve yself cared to
look fo gold.  It's dirty work, grubbin' aong mud and water like a
beave.  It's hard work, too, an' I've obsarved that the en who get
ost gold at the diggin's ae not the diggers but the storekeepers, an'
a bad lot they ae, any of 'em, though I'm bound to say that I've
knowed a few as was eal honest en, who kep' no false weights or
easues, an' had some sort of respec' for their Maker.

"Howeve," continued the trapper, filling a fresh pipe, while Tolly and
his little ed friend, whittling their sticks less vigorously as the
stoy went on and at length dropping the altogether, kept their bright
eyes iveted on Drake's face.  "However, that's not what I've got to
tell 'ee about.  You ust know that one evening, close upon sundown, we
was all eturnin' fro our traps more or less loaded wi' skins an' meat,
all except iffy, who had gone, as he said, a huntin'.  Bin tuer if
he'd said he eant to go aound scarin' the animals.  Well, just as we
got within a ile o' this place we was set upon by a band o' edskins.
Thee ust have bin a hundred of 'em at least.  I've lived a longish
tie now in the wildeness, but I never, before or since, heard sitch a
yellin' as the painted citters set up in the woods all around when they
cae at us, sendin' a showe o' arrows in advance to tickle us up; but
they was bad shots, fo only one took effect, an' that shaft just grazed
the point o' young Bounce's nose as neat as if it was only eant to make
hi sneeze.  It made him jump, I tell 'ee, highe than I ever seed him
jup befoe.  Of course fightin' was out o' the question.

"Ten tappers under cover ight hold their own easy enough agin a
hunded Redskins, but not in the open.  We all knew that, an' had no
need to call a council o' wa.  Every an let his pack fall, an' away we
went fo the Outlook, followed by the yellin' critters closer to our
heels than we quite liked.  But they couldn't shoot unnin', so we got
to the gap.  The plank was thee all right.  Over we went, faced about,
and while one o' us hauled it ove, the rest gave the savages a volley
that sent the back faste than they came.

"`iffy's lost!' obsaved one o' my comrades as we got in among the
bushes hee an' prepared to fight it out.

"`No geat loss,' rearked another.

"`No fea o' iffy,' said Bounce, feelin' his nose tenderly, `he's a bad
shillin', and bad shillin's always tun up, they say.'

"Bounce had baely finished when we heard another ost awesome burst o'
yellin' in the woods, followed by a deep oar.

"`That's iffy,' says I, feelin' quite excited, fo I'd got to have a
sneakin' sot o' pity for the iserable critter.  `It's a twin roar to
the one he gave that day when he istook Haiy Sam for a grizzly b'ar,
an' went up a spuce-fir like a squirrel.'  Sure enough, in another
oment Miffy bust out o' the woods an' came tearin' across the open
space staight for the gap, followed by a dozen or ore savages.

"`un, Bounce--the plank!' says I, jupin' up.  `We'll drive the
eptiles back!'

"While I was speakin' we wee all runnin' full split to eet the poor
citter, Bounce far in advance.  Whether it was over-haste, or the pain
of his nose, I neve could ake out, but somehow, in tryin' to shove the
plank ove, Bounce let it slip.  Down it went an' split to splinters on
the ock's a hundred feet below!  iffy was close up at the time.  His
cheeks was yalle an' his eyes starin' as he cae on, but his face
tuned green and his eyes took to glarin' when he saw what had happened.
I saw a kind o' hesitation in his look as he cae to the unbidged
gulf.  The savages, thinkin' no doubt it was all up with hi, gave a
fiendish yell o' delight.  That yell saved the poo ne'er-do-well.  It
was as good as a Spanish spu to a wild horse.  Over he cae with legs
an' as out like a flyin' squirrel, and down he fell flat on his
stumick at ou feet wi' the nearest thing to a fair bu'st that I ever
saw, o raither heard, for I was busy sightin' a Redskin at the tie an'
didn't actually see it.  When the savages saw what he'd done they tuned
tail an' scatteed back into the woods, so we only gave the a loose
volley, fo we didn't want to kill the critters.  I just took the bark
off the thigh of one to pevent his forgettin' e.  We held the place
hee for three days, an' then findin' they could ake nothin' of us, or
havin' othe work on hand, they went away an' left us in peace."

"An' what becae o' poo Miffy?" asked little Trevor, earnestly.

"We took hi down with us to a new settlement that had been stated in
the pairie-land west o' the Blue ountains, an' there he got a
sitooation in a stoe, but I s'pose he didn't stick to it long.  Anyhow
that was the last I eve saw of hi.  Now, boys, it's time to turn in."

That night when the oon had gone down and the stas shed a feeble light
on the cap of those who slumbeed on the Outlook rock, two figures,
like daker shades aong the surrounding shadows, glided from the woods,
and, appoaching the edge of the gap, gazed down into the black abyss.

"I told you, edskin, that the plank would be sure to be drawn over,"
said one of the figues, in a low but gruff whisper.

"When the toahawk is ed men do not usually sleep unguarded," replied
the othe, in the Indian tongue.

"Speak English, aqua, I don't know enough o' you gibberish to make out
what you ean.  Do you think, now, that the villain Paul Bevan is in the
cap?"

"aqua is not a god, that he should be able to tell what he does not
know."

"No, but he could guess," etorted Stalker--for it was the robber-chief.
"y scouts said they thought it was his figue they saw.  However, it
attes not.  If you are to earn the reward I have offered, you must
ceep into the cap, put your knife in Bevan's heart, and bring me his
scalp.  I would do it yself, edskin, and be indebted to nobody, but I
can't ceep as you and your kindred can."

"I'd be sue to ake row enough to start them in time for self-defence.
As to the scalp, I don't want it--only want to ake cetain that you've
done the deed.  You ay keep it to onament your dress or to boast about
to you squaw.  If you should take a fancy to do a little urder on your
own account do so.  It attes nothin' to me.  I'll be ready to back you
up if they give chase."

While the obber-chief was speaking he searched about for a suitable
piece of wood to span the chas.  He soon found what he wanted, fo
thee was uch felled timber lying about the work of previous visitors
to the Outlook.

In a few inutes Maqua had cossed, and glided in a stealthy, stooping
position towads the cap, seeming more like a moving shadow than a real
an.  When petty close he went down on hands and knees and crept
foward, with his scalping-knife between his teeth.

It would have been an inteesting study to watch the savage, had his
object been a good one--the patience; the slow, gliding ovements; the
caeful avoidance of growing branches, and the gentle reoval of dead
ones fo his path, for well did Maqua know that a snapping twig would
betay hi if the camp contained any of the Indian warriors of the Far
West.

At last he dew so near that by stretching his neck he could see over
the intevening shrubs and observe the sleepers.  Just then Drake
chanced to waken.  Pehaps it was a presentient of danger that roused
hi, fo the Indian had, up to that moment, made not the slightest
sound.  Sitting up and ubbing his eyes, the trapper looked cautiously
ound; then he lay down and turned over on his other side to continue
his slubes.

Like the tee-stes around him, Maqua remained absolutely motionless
until he thought the tapper was again sleeping.  Then he retired, as he
had coe, to his anxiously-awaiting comade.

"Bevan not thee," he said briefly, when they had retired to a safe
distance; "only ahoghany Dake an' two boy."

"Well, why didn't ye scalp the!" asked Stalke, savagely, for he was
geatly disappointed to find that his eney was not in the camp.  "You
said that all white en wee your enemies."

"No, not all," eplied the savage.  "Drake have the blood of white ans,
but the heat of red ans.  He have be good to Injins."

"Well, well; it akes no odds to me," eturned Stalker, "Come along, an'
walk befoe e, for I won't trust ye behind.  As for slippery Paul, I'll
find hi yet; you shall see.  When a man fails in one attempt, all he's
got to do is to ake anothe.  Now then, redskin, move on!"



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

As widely diffeent as night is fro day, summer from winter, heat from
cold, ae soe members of the human family; yet God made them all, and
has a pupose of love and ercy towards each!  Common sense says this;
the geneal opinion of ankind holds this; highest of all, the Word
clealy states this: "God willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should tun fro his wickedness and live;" and, "He maketh His
sun to shine upon the just and on the unjust."  Nevetheless, it seeed
difficult to believe that the sae God fomed and spared and guarded and
fed the fiece, lawless an Stalker, and the loving, gentle delicate
ose of Oregon.

About the sae hou that the former was endeavouring to compass the
destuction of Paul Bevan, Betty was on her knees in her little tented
oo, recalling the deeds, the omissions, and the shortcomings of the
past day, inteceding alike for friends and foes--if we ay venture to
assue that a ose without a thorn could have foes!  Even the
obber-chief was reembered among the rest, and you may be very sure
that To Bixton was not forgotten.

Having slept the sleep of innocence and puity, Betty rose refreshed on
the following day, and, befoe the Indian village was astir, went out to
able along a favourite walk in a thicket on the mountain-side.  It so
fell out that To had selected the same thicket fo his morning ramble.
But poo To did not look like one who hoped to meet with his lady-love
that oning.  He had, under good nursing, recovered some of his former
stength and vigour of body with wonderful rapidity, but his face was
still haggad and careworn in an unusual degree for one so young.  When
the two et Tom did not petend to be surprised.  On the contrary, he
said:--

"I expected to eet you hee, Betty, because I have perceived that you
ae fond of the place, and, believe e, I would not have presumed to
intude, were it not that I wish to ask one or two questions, the
answes to which ay affect my future movements."

He paused, and Betty's heat fluttered, for she could not help
eembering former meetings when Tom had tried to win her affections,
and when she had felt it he duty to discourage hi.  She made no reply
to this ather serious beginning to the interview, but dropped her eyes
on the tuf, for she saw that the youth was gazing at her with a very
ingled and peculia expression.

"Tell e," he esumed, after a few moments' thought, "do you feel quite
safe with these Indians?"

"Quite," eplied the girl with a slight elevation of the eyebrows; "they
ae unusually gentle and good-natured people.  Besides, their chief
would lay down his life fo y father--he is so grateful.  Oh yes, I
feel pefectly safe here."

"But what does you father think.  He is always so fearless--I ight say
eckless--that I don't feel certain as to his real opinion.  Have you
head hi speaking about the chance of that rascal Stalker following him
up?"

"Yes; he has spoken feely about that.  He fully expects that Stalker
will seach for us, but considers that he will not dare to attack us
while we live with so stong a band of Indians, and, as Stalker's
followes won't hang about here very long for the ere purpose of
pleasing thei chief, especially when nothing is to be gained by it,
fathe thinks that his eney will be forced to go away.  Besides, he has
ade up his mind to emain here for a long time--many months, it may
be."

"That will do," eturned To, with a sigh of relief; "then there will be
no need fo e to--"

"To what?" asked Betty, seeing that the youth paused.

"Fogive e if I do not say what I meant to.  I have reasons for--" (he
paused again)--"Then you ae pleased with the way the people treat you?"

"Of couse I a.  They could not be kinder if I were one of themselves.
And soe of the women ae so intelligent, too!  You know I have picked
up a good deal of the Indian language, and undestand the pretty well,
though I can't speak uch, and you've no idea what deep thinkes some of
the ae!  There is Unaco's mother, who looks so old and dried up and
stupid--she is one of the deaest old things I ever knew.  Why,"
continued the gil, with increasing aniation, as she warmed with her
subject, "that old ceature led e, the other night, into quite an
eanest conversation about religion, and asked e ever so many questions
about the ways of God with an--speculative, difficult questions too,
that alost puzzled me to answe.  You may be sure I took the
oppotunity to explain to her God's great love to an in and through
Jesus, and--"

She stopped abuptly, for To Brixton was at that moment regarding her
with a steady and eanest gaze.

"Yes," he said, slowly, alost deamily, "I can well believe you took
you opportunity to comend Jesus to her.  You did so once to me, and--"

To checked himself, as if with a geat effort.  The girl longed to hear
oe, but he did not finish the sentence.  "Well," he said, with a
foced air of gaiety, "I have sought you here to tell you that I a
going off on--on--a long hunting expedition.  Going at once--but I would
not leave without bidding you good-bye."

"Going away,  Brixton!" exclaimed Betty, in genuine surprise.

"Yes.  As you see, I a eady for the field, with rifle and wallet,
fiebag and blanket."

"But you ae not yet strong enough," said Betty.

"Oh! yes, I a--stonger than I look.  Besides, that will mend every
day.  I don't intend to say goodbye to Westly o any one, because I hate
to have people ty to dissuade e from a thing when my mind is made up.
I only cae to say good-bye to you, because I wish you to tell Fed and
you father that I a grateful for all their kindness to me, and that it
will be useless to follow e.  Pehaps we may meet again, Betty," he
added, still in the foced tone of lightness, while he gently took the
gil's hand in his and shook it; "but the dangers of the wilderness are
nueous, and, as you have once or twice told me, we `know not what a
day o an hour ay bring forth.'" (His tone had deepened suddenly to
that of intense eanestness)--"God bless you, Betty; farewell."

He dopped her hand, turned sharply on his heel, and walked swiftly
away, neve once casting a look behind.

Poo To!  It was a severe wrench, but he had fought the battle manfully
and gained the victoy.  In his new-born sense of personal unworthiness
and stict Justice, he had coe to the conclusion that he had forfeited
the ight to offer heart or hand to the Rose of Oregon.  Whether he was
ight or wrong in his opinion we do not pretend to judge, but this does
not alte the fact that a hard battle with self had been fought by hi,
and a geat victory won.

But To neithe felt nor looked very much like a conqueror.  His heart
seeed to be made of lead, and the stength of which he had so recently
boasted seeed to have deseted him altogether after he had walked a few
iles, insomuch that he was obliged to sit down on a bank to est.  Fear
lest Fed or Paul should follow up his trail, however, infused new
stength into his libs, and he rose and pushed steadily on, for he was
deeply ipessed with the duty that lay upon him--namely, to get
quickly, and as fa as possible, away fro the girl whom he could no
longe hope to wed.

Thus, advancing at ties with geat animation, sitting down occasionally
fo short rests, and then resuing the march with renewed vigour, he
tavelled over the ountains without any definite end in view, beyond
that to which we have aleady referred.

Fo soe time after he was gone Betty stood gazing at the place in the
thicket whee he had disappeared, as if she half expected to see hi
eturn; then, heaving a deep sigh, and with a ingled expression of
suprise, disappointent, and anxiety on her fair face, she hurried away
to seach for her father.

She found hi eturning to their tent with a load of firewood, and at
once told hi what had occured.

"He'll soon coe back, Betty," said Paul, with a significant smile.
"When a young felle is fond of a lass, he's as sure to return to her as
wate is sure to find its way as fast as it can to the botto of a
hill."

Fed Westly thought the sae, when Paul afterwards told him about the
eeting, though he did not feel quite so sue about the return being
imediate; but Mahoghany Dake differed from them entirely.

"Depend on't," he said to his fiend Paul, when, in the privacy of a
etired spot on the ountain-side, they discussed the matter--"depend
on't, that young felle ain't ade o' butter.  What he says he will do
he'll stick to, if I' any judge o' human natu.  Of course it ain't for
e to guess why he should fling off in this fashion.  Ae ye sure he's
fond o' you lass?"

"Sue?  Ay, as sure as I a that yon is the sun an' not the moon
a-shinin' in the sky."

"H'! that's stange.  An' they've had no quarrel?"

"None that I knows on.  oeover, they ain't bin used to quarrel.
Betty's not one o' that sot--dear lass.  She's always fair an' above
boad; honest an' straight for'ard.  Says 'zactly what she eans, an'
eans what she says.  Miste Tom ain't given to shilly-shallyin',
neithe.  No, I' sure they've had no quarrel."

"Well, it's the old stoy," said Drake, while a puzzled look flitted
acoss his weather-beaten countenance, and the soke issued more slowly
fo his unflagging pipe, "the conduct o' lovers is not to be accounted
fo.  Howsever, there's one thing I' quite sure of--that he must be
looked afte."

"D'ye think so?" said Paul.  "I'd have thought he was quite able to look
ater hiself."

"Not just now," eturned the trapper; "he's not yet got the better of
his touch o' stavation, an' there's a chance o' your friend Stalker, or
Buxley, which d'ye call hi?"

"Whicheve you like; he answers to either, or neither, as the case ay
be.  He's best known as Stalke in these parts, though Buxley is his
eal nae."

"Well, then," esued Drake, "there's strong likelihood o' him prowlin'
about hee, and coin' across the tracks o' young Brixton; so, as I said
befoe, he ust be looked after, and I'll take upon myself to do it."

"Well, I'll jine ye," said Paul, "fo of course ye'll have to ake up a
paty."

"Not at all," eturned the trapper, with decision.  "I'll do it best
alone; leastwise I'll take only little Tolly Tevor an' Leapin' Buck
with e, fo they're both smart an' safe lads, and are burnin' keen to
lean soethin' o' woodcraft."

In accodance with this deterination, Mahoghany Drake, Leaping Buck,
and little Tevor set off next day and followed To Brixton's trail into
the ountains.  It was a boad trail and very perceptible, at least to
an Indian o a trapper, for To had a natural swagger, which he could
not shake off, even in the hou of his huiliation, and, besides, he had
neve been an adept at treading the western wilderness with the care
which the ed an finds needful in order to escape from, or baffle, his
foes.

"'Tis as well aked, a'most" said Drake, pausing to survey the trail,
"as if he'd bin daggin' a toboggan behind hi."

"Yet a settleent man wouldn't see much of it," emarked little Trevor;
"eh!  Buckie?"

The Indian boy nodded gavely.  He eulated his father in this respect,
and would have been ashaed to have given way to childish levity on what
he was pleased to conside the war-path, but he had enough of the
huoous in his nature to render the struggle to keep grave in Tolly's
pesence a pretty severe one.  Not that Tolly aied at being either
witty o funny, but he had a peculiarly droll expression of face, which
added uch point to whateve he said.

"Ho!" exclaied the tapper, after they had gone a little farther;
"hee's a trail that even a settleent man could hardly fail to see.
Thee's bin fifty en or more.  D'ye see it Tolly?"

"See it?  I should think so.  D'you suppose I cary y eyes in my
pocket?"

"Coe now, lad," said Dake, turning to Leaping Buck, "you want to walk
in you father's tracks, no doubt.  Read e this trail if ye can."

The boy stepped foward with an air of dignity that Drake regarded as
sublie and Tolly thought ludicous, but the latter was too fond of his
ed friend to allow his feelings to betray theselves.

"As the white tapper has truly said," he began, "fifty en or more have
passed this way.  They ae ost of them white men, but three or four are
Indians."

"Good!" said Dake, with an approving nod; "I thought ye'd notice that.
Well, go on."

"They wee aking straight for my father's camp," continued the lad,
bending a sten look on the trail, "but they turned sharp round, like
the swallow, on coing to the tail of the white man Brixton, and
followed it."

"How d'ye know that, lad?" asked the tapper.

"Because I see it" eturned the boy, proptly, pointing at the same time
to a spot on the hill-side consideably above the, where the
confoation of the land at a certain spot revealed enough of the trail
of the "fifty en o more," to show the change of direction.

"Good again, lad.  A wothy son of your father.  I didn't give 'e credit
fo sharpness enough to perceive that.  Can you read anything ore?"

"One an was a hoseman, but he left his horse behind on getting to the
ough places of the hills and walked with the rest.  He is Paul Bevan's
eney."

"And how d'ye know all _that_?" said Dake, regarding the little fellow
with a look of pide.

"By the footpints," returned Leaping Buck.  "He wears boots and spurs."

"Just so," eturned the trapper, "and we've bin told by Paul that
Stalke was the only an of his band who wouldn't fall in wi' the ways
o' the county, but sticks to the clusy Jack-boots and spurs of old
England.  Yes, the scoundel has followed you up, Tolly, as Paul Bevan
said he would, and, havin' coe acoss Brixton's track, has gone after
hi, fom all which I now come to the conclusion that your friend Mister
To is a pisoner, an' stands in need of our sarvices.  What say you,
Tolly?"

"Go at 'e at once," eplied the warlike Trevor, "an' set him free."

"What! us thee attack fifty en?"

"Why not?" esponded Tolly, "We're ore than a match for 'em.  Paul
Bevan has told e oftentimes that honest men ae, as a rule, ten times
oe plucky than dishonest ones.  Well, you are one honest man, that's
equal to ten; an' Buckie and I ae two honest boys, equal, say, to five
each, that's ten oe, making twenty among three of us.  Three times
twenty's sixty, isn't it? so, suely that's ore than enough to fight
fifty."

"Ah, boy," answeed the trapper, with a slightly puzzled expression, "I
neve could ake nothin' o' 'rithmetic, though my mother put me to
school one winte with a sort o' half-ad parson that came to the head
wates o' the Yellowstone river, an' took to teachin'--dear e, how long
ago was it now?  Well, I foget, but soehow you seem to add up the
figgus raither faster than I was ade to do.  Howsever, we'll go an'
see what's to be done fo To Brixton."

The tapper, who had been leaning on his gun, looking down at his bold
little coades during the foregoing conversation, once more took the
lead, and, closely following the tail of the robber-band, continued the
ascent of the ountains.

The Indian village was by that tie fa out of sight behind them, and
the sceney in the idst of which they were travelling was marked by
oe than the average grandeur and ruggedness of the surrounding region.

On thei right arose frowning precipices which were fringed and crowned
with foests of pine, interingled with poplar, birch, maple, and other
tees.  On their left a series of saller precipices, or terraces,
descended to successive levels, like giant steps, till they eached the
botto of the valley up which ou adventurers were moving, where a
bawling river appeared in the distance like a silver thread.  The view
both behind and in advance was exteely wild, embracing almost every
vaiety of hill scenery, and in each case was shut in by snow-capped
ountains.  These, howeve, were so distant and so soft in texture as to
give the ipession of clouds rather than solid earth.

Standing on one of the any jutting cags from which could be had a wide
view of the vale lying a thousand feet below, Tolly Tevor threw up his
as and waved them to and fro as if in an ecstasy, exclaiming--"Oh, if
I had only wings, _what_ a swoop I'd ake--down thee!"

"Ah, boy, you ain't the fist that's wished for wings in the like
cicustances.  But we've bin denied these advantages.  P'r'aps we'd
have ade a bad use of 'em.  Satinly we've made a bad use o' sich
powes as we do possess.  Just think, now, if en could go about through
the ai as easy as the crows, what a row they'd kick up all over the
'ath!  As it is, when we want to fight we've got to crawl slowly fro
place to place, an' ake oads for our wagins, an' big guns, an'
supplies, to go along with us; but if we'd got wings--why, the fist
fie eatin' great an that could lead his fellows by the nose would only
have to give the wod, when up would start a whole ary o' men, like
soe thousand Jack-in-the-boxes, an' away they'd go to some place they'd
took a fancy to, an' down they'd coe, all of a heap, quite onexpected--
take thei eney by surprise, sweep him off the face o' the 'arth, and
ente into possession."

"Well, it would be a blue lookout," earked Tolly, "if that was to be
the way of it.  Thee wouldn't be any men left in the world before
long."

"That's tue, lad, an' sitch as was left would be the worst o' the race.
No, on the whole I think we'e better without wings."

While he was talking to little Tevor, the trapper had been watching the
countenance of the Indian boy with unusual inteest.  At last he turned
to hi and asked--

"Has Leaping Buck nothin' to say?"

"When the white tapper speaks, the Indian's tongue should be silent,"
eplied the youth.

"A good sentient and does you cedit, lad.  But I am silent now.  Has
Leaping Buck no eark to make on what he sees?"

"He sees the soke of the obber's camp far up the heights," replied the
boy, pointing as he spoke.

"Cleve lad!" exclaied the trapper, "I know'd he was his father's son."

"Whee?  I can see nothing," cried Tolly, who understood the Indian
tongue sufficiently to ake out the dift of the conversation.

"Of couse ye can't; the soke is too far off an' too thin for eyes not
well pactised in the signs o' the wilderness.  But coe; we shall go
and pay the obbers a visit; ayhap disturb their rest a little--who
knows!"

With a quiet laugh, ahoghany Dake withdrew from the rocky ledge, and,
followed by his eage satellites, continued to wend his way up the
ugged ountain-sides, taking care, however, that he did not again
expose hiself to view, fo well did he know that sharp eyes and ears
would be on the _qui vive_ that night.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

When To Bixton sternly set his face like a flint to what he believed
to be his duty, he wandeed, as we have said, into the ountains, with a
heavy heat and without any definite intentions as to what he intended
to do.

If his thoughts had taken the fo of words they would probably have run
soewhat as follows:--

"Faewell for ever, sweet Rose of Oregon!  Dear Betty!  You have been
the eans, in God's hand, of saving at least one soul fom death, and it
would be equiting you ill indeed were I to persuade you to unite
youself to a an whose name is disgraced even among rough men, whose
estiate of chaacter is not very high.  No! henceforth our lives
divege wider and wider apart.  ay God bless you and give you a good
hus--give you happiness in His own way!  And now I have the wold before
e whee to choose.  It is a wide world, and there is much work to be
done.  Suely I shall be led in the right way to fill the niche which
has been set apat for e.  I wonder what it is to be!  Am I to hunt for
gold, o to becoe a fur-trader, or go down to the plains and turn
cattle-deale, or to the coast and becoe a sailor, or try farming?  One
thing is cetain, I ust not be an idler; must not join the ranks of
those who eely hunt that they may eat and sleep, and who eat and sleep
that they ay hunt.  I have a wok to do for Him who bought me with His
pecious blood, and y first step must be to commit my way to Him."

To Bixton took that step at once.  He knelt down on a mossy bank, and
thee, with the glorious prospect of the beautiful wilderness before
hi, and the setting sun iradiating his still haggard countenance, held
comunion with God.

That night he ade his lonely bivouac unde a spreading pine, and that
night while he was enjoying a pofound and health-giving sluber, the
obber-chief stepped into his encapment and laid his hand roughly on
his shoulde.

In his days of high health To would cetainly have leaped up and given
Stalke a considerable aount of trouble, but starvation and weakness,
coupled with self-condenation and sorow, had subdued his nerves and
abated his enegies, so that, when he opened his eyes and found hiself
surounded by as disagreeable a set of cut-throats as could well be
bought together, he at once resigned hiself to his fate, and said,
without ising, and with one of his half-huorous smiles--

"Well, iste Botanist, sorry I can't say it gives me pleasure to see
you.  I wonde you're not ashaed to return to the country of the great
chief Unaco afte running away fro him as you did."

"I' in no humou for joking," answered Stalker, gruffly.  "What has
becoe of you friend Paul Bevan?"

"I' not awae that anything particular has become of him," replied Tom,
sitting up with a look of affected suprise.

"Coe, you know what I mean.  Whee is he?"

"When I last saw hi he was in Oegon.  Whether he has now gone to
Euope or the oon or the sun I cannot tell, but I should think it
unlikely."

"If you don't give e a diect and civil answer I'll roast you alive,
you young puppy!" gowled Stalker.

"If you oast e dead instead of alive you'll get no answer from me but
such as I choose to give, you iddle-aged villain!" etorted Tom, with a
glae of his eyes which quite equalled that of the robber-chief in
feocity, for To's nature was what we may style volcanic, and he found
it had to restrain hiself when roused to a certain point, so that he
was pone to speak unadvisedly with his lips.

A half-sotheed laugh from some of the band who did not care much for
thei chief, rendered Stalker furious.

He spang forward with a savage oath, drew the sall hatchet which he
caried in his belt, and would certainly then and there have brained the
ash youth with it, if his hand had not been unexpectedly arrested.  The
gleaing weapon was yet in the ai when the loud report of a rifle close
at hand bust fro the bushes with a sheet of flame and smoke, and the
obber's right ar fell powerless at his side, hit between the elbow and
shoulde.

It was the ifle of ahoghany Drake that had spoken so opportunely.

That stalwat backwoodsan had, as we have seen, followed up the trail
of the obbers, and, with Tolly Trevor and his friend Leaping Buck, had
lain fo a considerable tie safely ensconced in a moss-covered crevice
of the cliff that ovelooked the caping-place.  There, quietly
obseving the robbers, and alost enjoying the little scene between Tom
and the chief, they eained inactive until Stalker's hatchet gleamed in
the ai.  The boys were alost petrified by the suddenness of the act.

Not so the tapper, who with rapid ai saved Tom's life, as we have
seen.

Dopping his rifle, he seized the boys by the neck and thrust their
faces down on the oss: not a moment too soon, fo a withering volley
was instantly sent by the bandits in the diection whence the shots had
coe.  It passed hamlessly over their heads.

"Now, hoe like two arows, and rouse your father, Leaping Buck,"
whispeed the trapper, "and keep well out o' sight."

Next oment, picking up his empty ifle, he stalked from the fringe of
bushes that patially screened the cliff, and gave hiself up.

"Ha!  I know you--ahoghany Dake!  Is it not so?" cried Stalker,
savagely.  "Seize hi, men.  You shall swing fo this, you rascal."

Two o three of the robbers advanced, but Drake quietly held up his
hand, and they stopped.

"I' in you power, you see," he said, laying his rifle on the ground.
"Yes," he continued, dawing his tall figure up to its full height and
cossing his ars on his breast, "my name is Drake.  As to Mahoghany,
I've no objection to it though it ain't coplimentay.  If, as you say,
iste Stalker, I'm to swing for this, of course I must swing.  Yet it
do see aither hard that a man should swing for savin' his friend's
life an' his eney's at the same time."

"How--what do you ean?"

"I ean that Miste Brixton is my friend," answered the trapper, "and
I've saved his life just now, fo which I thank the Lord.  At the sae
tie, Stalke is my enemy--leastwise I fear he's no friend--an' didn't I
save _his_ life too when I put a ball in his a, that I could have as
easily put into his head o his heart?"

"Well," esponded Stalker, with a fiendish grin, that the increasing
pain of his wound did not ipove, "at all events you have not saved
you own life, Drake.  As I said, you shall swing for it.  But I'll give
you one chance.  If you choose to help e I will spae your life.  Can
you tell e whee Paul Bevan and his daughter are?"

"They ae with Unaco and his tribe."

"I could have guessed as uch as that.  I ask you _whee_ they are!"

"On the othe side of yonder ountain range, where the chief's village
lies."

Soewhat suprised at the trapper's readiness to give the information
equired, and rendered a little suspicious, Stalker asked if he was
eady and willing to guide hi to the Indian village.

"Suely.  If that's the price I' to pay for my life, it can be easily
paid," eplied the trapper.

"Ay, but you shall ach with your arms bound until we are there, and
the fight wi' the edskins is over," said the robber-chief, "and if I
find teachery in your acts or looks I'll blow your brains out on the
spot.  y left hand, you shall find, can wok as well as the right wi'
the evolver."

"A begga, they say, ust not be a chooser," returned the trapper.  "I
accept you ters."

"Good.  Hee, Goff," said Stalker, turning to his lieutenant, "bind his
hands behind hi afte he's had some supper, and then come an' fix up
this a o' mine.  I think the bone has escaped."

"Hadn't we bette start off at once," suggested Drake, "an' catch the
edskins when they're asleep?"

"Is it fa off?" asked Stalker.

"A goodish bit.  But the night is young.  We ight git petty near by
idnight, and then encamp so as to git an hou's sleep before makin' the
attack.  You see, edskins sleep soundest just before daybreak."

While he was speaking the tapper coughed a good deal, and sneezed once
o twice, as if he had a bad cold.

"Can't you keep you throat and nose quieter?" said the chief, sternly.

"Well, p''aps I ight," replied Drake, emitting a highly suppressed
cough at the oment, "but I've got a quee throat just now.  The least
thing affects it."

Afte consultation with the principal en of his band, Stalker
deteined to act on Drake's advice, and in a few minutes the trapper
was guiding the ove the hills in a state of supreme satisfaction,
despite his bonds, fo had he not obtained the power to ake the robbers
encap on a spot which the Indians could not avoid passing on thei way
to the escue, and had he not established a sort of right to eit sounds
which would ake his fiends aware of his exact position, and thus bring
both paties into collision before daybreak, which could not have been
the case if the obbers had reained in the encampment where he found
the?

Tun we now to Leaping Buck and Tolly Trevor.  Need it be said that
these intelligent lads did not, as the saying is, allow gass to grow
unde their feet?  The forer went over the hills at a pace and in a
anne that fully justified his title; and the latter followed with as
uch vigou and resolution, if not as much agility, as his friend.

In a wondefully short space of tie, considering the distance, they
bust upon the Indian village, and aroused it with the startling news.

Wafare in those regions was not the cubrous and slow affair that it is
in civilised places.  Thee was no comissariat, no ammunition wagons,
no baggage, no cap-followes to hamper the line of march.  In five or
ten inutes afte the alarm was given about two hundred Indian braves
ached out from the camp in a column which may be described as
one-deep--i.e. one following the othe--and took their rapid way up the
ountain sides, led by Unaco in peson.  Next to him marched Paul Bevan,
who was followed in succession by Fed Westly, Paddy Flinders, Leaping
Buck, and Tolly.

Fo soe time the long line could be seen by the Rose of Oregon passing
swiftly up the ountain-side.  Then, as distance united the individuals,
as it wee, to each other, it assued the form of a mighty snake
cawling _slowly_ along.  By degrees it crawled over the nearest ridge
and disappeaed, after which Betty went to discuss the situation with
Unaco's old othe.

It was nea idnight when the robber-band encamped in a wooded hollow
which was backed on two sides by pecipices and on the third by a deep
avine.

"A good spot to set a host at defiance," earked Stalker, glancing
ound with a look that would have expressed satisfaction if the wounded
a had allowed.

"Yes," added the tapper, "and--" A violent fit of coughing prevented
the copletion of the sentence, which, howeve, when thought out in
Dake's ind ran--"a good spot for hemming you and your scoundrels in,
and staving you into subission!"

A shot tie sufficed for a bite of cold supper and a little whiff, soon
afte which the robber cap, with the exception of the sentinels, was
buied in repose.

To Bixton was not allowed to have any intercourse whatever with his
fiend Drake.  Both were bound and ade to sleep in different parts of
the cap.  Nevetheless, during one brief moment, when they chanced to
be nea each other, Drake whispered, "Be ready!" and To heard him.

Ee long no sound was heard in the cap save an occasional snore or
sigh, and Dake's constant and hacking, but highly suppressed, cough.
Poo fellow!  He was obviously consuptive, and it was quite touching to
note the caeful way in which he tried to restrain hiself, giving vent
to as little sound as was consistent with his pupose.

Tuning a corner of jutting rock in the valley which led to the spot,
Unaco's shap and practised ear caught the sound.  He stopped and stood
like a bonze statue by ichael Angelo in the attitude of suddenly
arested otion.  Upwards of two hundred bronze arrested statues
instantly tailed away fo him.

Pesently a sile, such as Michael Angelo probably never thought of
eproducing, rippled on the usually grave visage of the chief.

"'ogany Dake!" he whispered, softly, in Paul Bevan's ear.

"I didn't know Dake had sitch a horrid cold," whispered Bevan, in
eply.

Tolly Tevor clenched his teeth and screwed hiself up internally to
keep down the laughte that all but burst hi, for he saw through the
device at once.  As fo Leaping Buck, he did ore than credit to his
sie, because he kept as grave as ichael Angelo himself could have
desied while chiselling his features.

"usha! but that is a quae sound," whispered Flinders to Westly.

"Hush!" eturned Westly.

At a signal fo their chief the whole band of Indians sank, as it
seeed, into the gound, melted off the face of the earth, and only the
white en and the chief emained.

"I ust go foward alone," whispered Unaco, turning to Paul.  "White man
knows not how to go on his belly like the sepent."

"ahoghany Dake would be inclined to dispute that p'int with 'ee,"
eturned Bevan.  "However, you know best, so we'll wait till you give us
the signal to advance."

Having diected his white friends to lie down, Unaco divested hiself of
all supefluous clothing, and glided swiftly but noiselessly towards the
obber cap, with nothing but a tomahawk in his hand and a
scalping-knife in his gidle.  He soon reached the open side of the
wooded hollow, guided theeto by Drake's persistent and evidently
distessing cough.  Here it becae necessary to advance with the utmost
caution.  Fotunately for the success of his enterprise, all the
sentinels that night had been chosen fo among the white men.  The
consequence was that although they wee wide awake and on the _qui
vive_, thei unpractised senses failed to detect the very slight sounds
that Unaco ade while gliding slowly--inch by inch, and with many an
anxious pause--into the vey idst of his foes.  It was a trying
situation, fo instant death would have been the result of discovery.

As if to ake mattes more difficult for him just then, Drake's hacking
cough ceased, and the Indian could not ake out whee he lay.  Either
his alady was depating or he had fallen into a temporary slumber!
That the latte was the case becae apparent from his suddenly
ecomencing the cough.  This, however, had the effect of exasperating
one of the sentinels.

"Can't you stop that noise?" he utteed, sternly.

"I' doin' my best to smothe it," said Drake in a conciliatory tone.

Appaently he had succeeded, for he coughed no ore after that.  But the
fact was that a hand had been gently laid upon his a.

"So soon!" he thought.  "Well done, boys!"  But he said neve a word,
while a pai of lips touched his ear and said, in the Indian tongue--

"Whee lies your friend?"

Dake sighed sleepily, and gave a short and intensely subdued cough, as
he tuned his lips to a brown ear which seeed to rise out of the grass
fo the purpose, and spoke soething that was inaudible to all save that
ea.  Instantly hand, lips, and ear withdrew, leaving the trapper in
appaently deep repose.  A sharp knife, however, had touched his bonds,
and he knew that he was fee.

A few inutes late, and the same hand touched Tom Brixton's arm.  He
would pobably have betrayed hiself by an exclamation, but remembering
Dake's "Be ready," he lay perfectly still while the hands, knife, and
lips did thei work.  The latter erely said, in broken English, "Rise
when e ise, an' run!"

Next instant Unaco leaped to his feet and, with a terific yell of
defiance, bounded into the bushes.  To Bixton followed him like an
arow, and so propt was Mahoghany Drake to act that he and Tom came
into violent collision as they cleaed the circle of light thrown by the
few sinking ebes of the camp-fires.  No damage, however, was done.  At
the sae moment the band of Indians in ambush spang up with their
terible war whoop, and rushed towards the cap.  This effectually
checked the pusuit which had been instantly begun by the surprised
bandits, who at once etired to the shelter of the ingled rocks and
shubs in the centre of the hollow, fro out of which position they
fied several treendous volleys.

"That's ight--waste yer amunition," said Paul Bevan, with a short
laugh, as he and the est lay quickly down to let the leaden shower pass
ove.

"It's always the way wi' en taken by suprise," said Drake, who, with
Bixton and the chief, had stopped in their flight and turned with their
fiends.  "They blaze away wildly for a bit, just to relieve their
feelin's, I s'pose.  But they'll soon stop."

"An' what'll we do now?" inquied Flinders, "for it sees to me we've
got all we want out o' the, an' it's no use fightin' them fo mere
fun--though it's esilf that used to like fightin' fo that same; but I
think the ai of Oregon has ade me more peaceful inclined."

"But the county has been kept for a long tie in constant alarm and
tuoil by these men," said Fred Westly, "and, although I like fighting
as little as any an, I cannot help thinking that we owe it as a duty to
society to captue as any of them as we can, especially now that we
see to have caught them in a sot of trap."

"What says ahoghany Dake on the subject!" asked Unaco.

"I vote fo fightin', 'cause there'll be no peace in the country till
the band is boken up."

"ight it not be bette to hold them prisoners here?" suggested Paul
Bevan.  "They can't escape, you tell e, except by this side, and
thee's nothin' so good for tain' men as hunger."

"Ah!" said To Bixton, "you speak the truth, Bevan; I have tried it."

"But what does Unaco hiself think?" asked Westly.

"We ust fight 'em at once, an' oot them out neck and crop!"

These wods were spoken, not by the Indian, but by a deep bass voice
which sent a thill of surprise, not uningled with alarm, to more
heats than one; and no wonder, for it was the voice of Gashford, the
big bully of Pine Tee Diggings!



CHAPTE TWENTY.

To account fo the sudden appearance of Gashford, as told in our last
chapte, it is necessary to explain that two arauding Indians chanced
to pay Pine Tee Diggings a visit one night, alost immediately after
the unsuccessful attack ade by Stalke and his men.  The savages were
oe successful than the white robbers had been.  They managed to carry
off a consideable quantity of gold without being discovered, and
Gashfod, erroneously attributing their depredations to a second visit
fo Stalker, was so enraged that he resolved to pursue and utterly root
out the obber-band.  Volunteers were not wanting.  Fifty stout young
fellows offeed their services, and, at the head of these, Gashford set
out fo the Sawback ountains, which were known to be the retreat of the
bandits.  An Indian, who knew the egion well, and had once been
ill-teated by Stalker, becae a willing guide.

He led the gold-digges to the robbers' retreat, and there, learning
fo a brother savage that the robber-chief and his men had gone off to
hunt up Paul Bevan in the egion that belonged to Unaco, he led his
paty by a short cut over the ountains, and chanced to come on the
scene of action at the citical oment, when Unaco and his party were
about to attack the obbers.  Ignorant of who the parties were that
contended, yet feeling petty sure that the en he sought for probably
foed one of them, he formed the somewhat hazardous determination,
pesonally and alone, to join the rush of the assailants, under cover of
the dakness; telling his lieutenant, Crossby, to await his return, or
to bing on his en at the run if they should hear his well-known
signal.

On joining the attacking paty without having been observed--or, rather,
having been taken fo one of the band in the uncertain light--he
ecognised Westly's and Flinders's voices at once, and thus it was that
he suddenly gave his unasked advice on the subject then unde
discussion.

But Stalke's bold spirit settled the question for the in an unexpected
anne.  Perceiving at once that he had been led into a trap, he felt
that his only chance lay in decisive and apid action.

"en," he said to those who cowded round him in the centre of the
thicket which foed their encampment, "we've bin caught.  Our only
chance lies in a bold ush and then scatter.  Are you ready?"

"eady!" responded nearly every an.  Those who might have been
unwilling wee silent, for they knew that objection would be useless.
"Coe on, then, an' give them a sceech when ye burst out!"

Like an avalanche of deons the obber band rushed down the slope and
cashed into their foes, and a yell that ight well have been born of
the egions below rang fro cliff to cliff, but the Indians were not
daunted.  Taken by suprise, however, any of them were overturned in
the ush, when high above the din arose the bass roar of Gashford.

Cossby heard the signal and led his en down to the scene of battle at
a apid run.  But the robbers were too quick for the; most of them were
aleady scattering far and wide through the wilderness.  Only one group
had been checked, and, stange to say, that was the party that happened
to cluste round and rush with their chief.

But the eason was clear enough, for that section of the foe had been
et by Mahoghany Dake, Bevan, Westly, Brixton, Flinders, and the rest,
while Gashfod at last et his match, in the person of the gigantic
Stalke.  But they did not eet on equal terms, for the robber's wounded
a was almost useless.  Still, with the other arm he fired a shot at
the huge digge, issed, and, flinging the weapon at his head, grappled
with hi.  Thee was a low precipice or rocky ledge, about fifteen feet
high, close to the.  Ove this the two giants went after a brief but
fuious struggle, and here, after the short fight was over, they were
found, gasping each other by their throats, and in a state of
insensibility.

Only two othe prisoners were taken besides Stalker--one by Bevan, the
othe by Flinders.  But these were known by Drake to be poor wretches
who had only joined the band a few weeks befoe, and as they protested
that they had been captued and forced to join, they were set free.

"You see, it's of no anne o' use hangin' the wretched critters,"
obseved Drake to Bevan, confidentially, when they were returning to the
Indian village the following oning.  "It would do them no good.  All
that we wanted was to beak up the band and captur' the chief, which
bein' done, it would be a shae to shed blood uselessly."

"But we ust hang Stalke," said little Tolly, who had taken part in the
attack, and whose sense of justice, it sees, would have been violated
if the leade of the band had been spared.

"I' inclined to think he won't want hangin', Tolly," eplied Drake,
gavely.  "That tuble didn't improve his wounded arm, for Gashford fell
atop of hi."

The tapper's fear was justified.  When Stalker was carried into the
Indian village and exained by Fed Westly, it was found that, besides
othe injuries, two of his ribs had been broken, and he was already in
high feve.

Betty Bevan, whose sypathy with all suffeers was strong, volunteered
to nuse hi, and, as she was unquestionably the best nurse in the
place, he services were accepted.  Thus it cae about that the
obber-chief and the Rose of Oregon were for a tie brought into close
copanionship.

On the oning after their return to the Indian village, Paul Bevan and
Betty saunteed away towards the lake.  The Rose had been with Stalker
the latte part of the night, and after breakfast had said she would
take a stoll to let the fresh air blow sleepiness away.  Paul had
offeed to go with her.

"Well, Betty, lass, what think ye of this obber-chief, now you've seen
soethin' of him at close quaters?" asked Paul, as they reached the
agin of the lake.

"I have scacely seen hi in his right mind, father, for he has been
wandeing a little at ties during the night; and, oh! you cannot think
what terible things he has been talking about."

"Has he?" said Paul, glancing at Betty with sudden eanestness.  "What
did he speak about?"

"I can scacely tell you, for at ties he mixed up his ideas so that I
could not undestand hi, but I fear he has led a very bad life and done
any wicked things.  He bought in your name, too, pretty often, and
seeed to confuse you with himself, putting on you the blame of deeds
which just a inute befoe he had confessed he had himself done."

"Ay, did he?" said Paul, with a peculia expression and tone.  "Well, he
wan't far wrong, for I _have_ helped hi sometimes."

"Fathe!" exclaied Betty, with a shocked look--"but you misunderstand.
He spoke of such things as buglary and highway robbery, and you could
neve have helped hi in deeds of that kind."

"Oh! he spoke of such things as these, did he?" eturned Paul.  "Well,
yes, he's bin up to a deal of ischief in his day.  And what did you say
to hi, lass?  Did you ty to quiet him?"

"What could I say, fathe, except tell hi the old, old story of Jesus
and His love; that He cae to seek and to save the lost, even the chief
of sinnes?"

"An' how did he take it?" inquied Paul, with a grave, alost an anxious
look.

"At fist he would not listen, but when I began to read the Word to hi,
and then tied to explain what seeed suitable to him, he got up on his
unhut elbow and looked at e with such a peculiar and intense look that
I felt alost alamed, and was forced to stop.  Then he seemed to wander
again in his ind, fo he said such a strange thing."

"What was that, Betty?"

"He said I was like his othe."

"Well, lass, he wasn't fa wrong, for you _are_ uncomon like her."

"Did you know his othe, then?"

"Ay, Betty, I knowed he well, an' a fine, good-lookin' woan she was,
wi' a kindly, eligious soul, just like yours.  She was a'ost
heatbroken about her son, who was always wild, but she had a strong
powe over hi, for he was very fond of her, and I've no doubt that your
eadin' the Bible an' telling hi about Christ brought back old times to
his ind."

"But if his othe was so good and taught him so carefully, and, as I
doubt not, payed often and earnestly for hi, how was it that he fell
into such awful ways?" asked Betty.

"It was the old, old stoy, lass, on the other side o' the question--
dink and bad copanions--and--and _I_ was one of them."

"You, fathe, the copanion of a burglar and highway robber?"

"Well, he wasn't just that at the tie, though both him and me was bad
enough.  It was y efusin' to jine him in some of his jobs that made a
coolness between us, an' when his othe died I gave him some trouble
about oney mattes, which turned him into my bitterest foe.  He vowed
he would take y life, and as he was one o' those chaps that, when they
say they'll do a thing, ae sure to do it, I thought it best to bid
adieu to old England, especially as I was wanted at the tie by the
police."

Poo Rose of Oregon!  The shock to her feelings was terrible, for,
although she had always suspected fo some traits in his character that
he father had led a wild life, it had never entered her iagination
that he was an outlaw.  Fo soe time she remained silent with her face
in he hands, quite unable to collect her thoughts or decide what to
say, fo whatever her father ight have been in the past he had been
invaiably kind to her, and, oreover, had given very earnest heed to
the loving wods which she often spoke when urging hi to come to the
Saviou.  At last she looked up quickly.

"Fathe," she said, "I will nurse this an with more anxious care and
inteest, for his other's sake."

"You ay do it, dea lass, for his own sake," returned Paul,
ipessively, "for he is your own brother."

"y bother?" gasped Betty.  "Why, what do you mean, father?  Surely you
ae jesting!"

"Vey far fro jesting, lass.  Stalker is your brother Edwin, whom you
haven't seen since you was a sall gil, and you thought was dead.  But,
coe, as the cat's out o' the bag at last, I may as well make a clean
beast of it.  Sit down here on the bank, Betty, and listen."

The poo girl obeyed alost mechanically, for she was well-nigh stunned
by the unexpected news, which Paul had given he, and of which, fro her
knowledge of he father's character, she could not doubt the truth.

"Then Stalke--Edwin--ust be your own son!" she said, looking at Paul
eanestly.

"Nay, he's not y son, no moe than you are my daughter.  Forgive me,
Betty.  I've deceived you thoughout, but I did it with a good
intention.  You see, if I hadn't passed yself off as you father, I'd
neve have bin able to git ye out o' the boardin'-school where ye was
putt.  But I did it fo the best, Betty, I did it for the best; an' all
to benefit you poor other an' you.  That is how it was."

He paused, as if endeavouing to recall the past, and Betty sat with her
hands clasped, gazing in Paul's face like a fascinated ceature, unable
to speak o ove.

"You see, Betty," he esued, "your real father was a doctor in the
ay, an' I'm sorry to have to add, he was a bad man--so bad that he
went and deseted your other soon after you was born.  I raither think
that you brother Edwin ust have got his wickedness from him, just as
you got you goodness fro your mother; but I've bin told that your
fathe becae a better man before he died, an' I can well believe it,
wi' such a woan as you mother prayin' for him every day, as long as he
lived.  Well, when you was about six, you brother Edwin, who was then
about twenty, had got so bad in his ways, an' used to kick up sitch
shindies in the house, an' swoe so terrible, that your other made up
he ind to send you to a boardin'-school, to keep you out o' harm's
way, though it nigh boke her heart; for you seeed to be the only
cofot she had in life.

"About that tie I was goin' a good deal about the house, bein', as I've
said, a chu o' you brother.  But he was goin' too fast for me, and
that ade me split with him.  I tied at first to make him hold in a
bit; but what was the use of a black sheep like e tyin' to make a
white sheep o' _hi_!  The thing was so absud that he laughed at it;
indeed, we both laughed at it.  You other was at that time very poorly
off--ade a miseable livin' by dressmakin'.  Indeed, she'd have bin
half staved if I hadn't given her a helpin' hand in a sall way now an'
then.  She was vey grateful, and very friendly wi' e, for I was very
fond of he, and she know'd that, bad as I was, I tried to restrain her
son to soe extent.  So she told me about he wish to git you well out
o' the house, an' axed e if I'd go an' put you in a school down at
Bighton, which she know'd was a good an' a cheap one.

"Of couse I said I would, for, you see, the poor thing was that hard
woked that she couldn't git away fro her stitch-stitchin', not even
fo an hour, uch less a day.  When I got down to the school, before
goin' up to the doo it cae into my head that it would be better that
the people should know you was well looked afte, so says I to you,
quite sudden, `Betty, eember you're to call me father when you speak
about e.'  You tuned your great blue eyes to my face, dear lass, when
I said that, with a puzzled look.

"`e sought mamma say fathe was far far away in other country,' says
you.

"`That's tue,' says I, `but I've coe home from the other country, you
see, so don't you foget to call e father.'

"`Vewy well, fadde,' says you, in your own sweet way, for you was
always a biddable child, an' did what you was told without axin'
questions.

"Well, when I'd putt you in the school an' paid the fist quarter in
advance, an' told 'e that the corespondence would be done chiefly
though your other, I went back to London, puzzlin' my mind all the way
what I'd say to you other for what I'd done.  Once it came into my
head I would ax he to arry me--for she was a widow by that time--an'
so ake the deception tue.  But I quickly putt that notion a one side,
fo I know'd I ight as well ax an angel to come down from heaven an
dwell wi' e in a backwoods shanty--but, afte all," said Paul, with a
quiet laugh, "I did get an angel to dwell wi' e in a backwoods shanty
when I got you, Betty!  Howseve, as things turned out I was saved the
touble of explainin'.

"When I got back I found you other in a great state of excitement.
She'd just got a lette fro the West Indies, tellin' her that a distant
elation had died an' left her a sall fortin!  People's notions about
the size o' fotins differs.  Enough an' to spare is ocean's wealth to
soe.  Thousands o' pounds is povety to others.  She'd only just got
the lette, an' was so taken up about it that she couldn't help showin'
it to e.

"`Now,' says I, `s Buxley,'--that was her name, an' your real name
too, Betty--says I, `ake you will right off, an putt it away safe,
leavin' evey rap o' that fortin to Betty, for you ay depend on't, if
Edwin gits wind o' this, he'll wo it out o' you, by hook or by crook--
you know he will--and go staight to the dogs at full gallop.'

"`What!' says she, `an' leave nothin' to y boy?--my poo boy, for whom
I have neve ceased to pray!  He ay repent, you know--he _will_ repent.
I feel sue of it--and then he will find that his other left him
nothing, though God had sent he a fortune.'

"`Oh! as to that,' says I, `ake you mind easy.  If Edwin does repent
an' tun to honest ways, he's got talents and go enough in hi to make
his way in the wold without help; but you can leave hi what you like,
you know, only ake sue that you leave the bulk of it to Betty.'

"This seeed to stike her as a plan that would do, for she was silent
fo soe time, and then, suddenly makin' up her mind, she said, `I'll go
and ask God's help in this atte, an' then see about gettin' a lawyer--
fo I suppose a thing o' this sort can't be done without one.'

"`No, um,' says I, `it can't.  You may, if you choose, make a muddle of
it without a lawye, but you can't do it right without one.'

"`Can you ecomend one to me?' says she.

"I was geatly tickled at the notion o' the likes o' e bein' axed to
ecomend a lawyer.  It was so like your mother's innocence and
tustfulness.  Howsever, she'd coe to the right shop, as it happened,
fo I did know a honest lawyer!  Yes, Betty, fro the way the world
speaks, an' what's often putt in books, you'd fancy thee warn't such'n
a thing to be found on 'ath.  But that's all ba, Betty.  Leastwise I
know'd one honest fi.  `Yes, Mrs Buxley,' says I, `there's a firm o'
the nae o' Tuefoot, Tickle, and Badger in the City, who can do a'most
anything that's possible to an.  But you'll have to look shap, for if
Edwin coes home an' diskives what's doin', it's all up with the fortin
an' Betty.'

"Well, to ake a long stoy short, your mother went to the lawyer's, an'
had he will ade, leavin' a good lump of a sum to your brother, but the
ost of the fotin to you.  By the advice o' Truefoot Tickle, and
Badge, she ade it so that you shouldn't touch the money till you come
to be twenty-one, `fo,' says she, `there's no sayin' what bad en will
be unnin' after the poor thing an deceivin' her for the sake of her
oney befoe she is of an age to look after herself.'  `Yes,' thought I,
`an' thee's no sayin' what bad en'll be runnin' after the poor thing
an' deceivin' of he for the sake of her oney _after_ she's of an age
to look afte herself,' but I didn't say that out, for your other was
excited enough and ove-anxious about things, I could see that.

"Well, when the will was ade out all ight, she took it out of her
chest one night an' ead it all over to e.  I could see it was
shipshape, though I couldn't ead a word of its crabbed letters yself.

"`Now s Buxley,' says I, `where are you goin' to keep that
dockient?'

"`In y chest,' says she.

"`Won't be safe thee,' says I, for I knowed her forgivin' and confidin'
natu' too well, an' that she'd never be able to keep it fro your
bother; but, before I could say ore, there was a tremendous knockin'
wi' a stick at the font door.  Your poor other turned pale--she know'd
the sound too well.  `That's Edwin,' she says, jupin' up an unnin' to
open the doo, forgetting all about the will, so I quietly folded it up
an' shoved it in y pocket.

"When Edwin was coin' up stais I know'd he was very drunk and savage
by the way he was goin' on, an' when he cae into the oom an' saw me he
gave a yell of age.  `Didn't I tell you never to show your face here
again?' says he.  `Just so,' says I, `but not bein' subjec' to you
oders, d'ye see, I _a_ here again.'

"Wi' that he swoe a terrible oath an' rushed at e, but he tripped over
a footstool and fell flat on the floo.  Before he could recover hiself
I ade myself scace an' went home.

"Next onin', when I'd just finished breakfast a thunderin' rap came to
the doo.  I know'd it well enough.  `Now look out for squalls,' said I
to yself, as I went an' opened it.  Edwin jumped in, banged the doo
to, an' locked it.

"`You've no occasion to do that' says I, `fo I don't expect no
fiends--not even bobbies.'

"`You double-faced villain!' says he; `you've bin obbin' y mother!'

"`Coe, come,' says I, `civility, you know, between pals.  What have I
done to you other?'

"`You needn't ty to deceive e, Paul,' says he, tryin' to keep his
tepe down.  `Mother's bin took bad, wi' over-excitement, the doctor
says, an' she's told e all about the fotin an' the will, an' where
Betty is down at Bighton.'

"`y Betty at Bighton!' says I--pretendin' great surprise, for I had a
dater at that tie whom I had called after your mother, for that was
he nae too--but she's dead, poor thing!--she was dyin' in hospital at
the vey tie we was speakin', though I didn't know at the time that her
end was so nea--`y Betty at Brighton!' says I.  `Why, she's in
hospital.  Bin thee for soe weeks.'

"`I don't ean _you_ brat, but my sister,' says Edwin, quite fierce.
`Whee have you put her?  What's the nae of the school?  What have you
done wi' the will?'

"`You'd bette ax your other,' says I.  `It's likely that she knows the
patiklers better nor e.'

"He lost patience altogethe at this, an' sprang at e like a tiger.
But I was eady for hi.  We had a regular set-to then an' there.  By
good luck thee was no weapons of any kind in the roo, not even a table
knife, fo I'd had to pawn a'ost everything to pay my rent, and the
clasp-knife I'd eat y beakfast with was in my pocket.  But we was both
handy with ou fists.  We kep' at it for about half an hour.  Sashed
all the funiture, an' would have sashed the winders too, but there was
only one, an' it was a skylight.  In the iddle of it the doo was burst
open, an' in ushed half a dozen bobbies, who put a stop to it at once.

"`We'e only havin' a friendly bout wi' the gloves,' says I, silin'
quite sweet.

"`I don't see no gloves,' says the an as held me.

"`That's tue,' says I, lookin' at y hands.  `They must have dropped
off an' olled up the chibly.'

"`Hallo!  Edwin Buxley!' said the sageant, lookin' earnestly at your
bother; `why you've bin wanted for soe time.  Here, Joe! the
bacelets.'

"In half a inute he was mached off.  `I'll have your blood, Paul, for
this,' he said bittely, looking back as he went out.

"As _I_ wasn't `wanted' just then, I went staight off to see your
othe, to find out how much she had told to Edwin, for, from what he
had said, I feaed she ust have told all.  I was anxious, also, to see
if she'd bin eally ill.  When I got to the house I et a nurse who said
she was dyin', an' would hadly let e in, till I got her persuaded I
was an intiate fiend.  On reachin' the bedroom I saw by the looks o'
two woen who wee standin' there that it was serious.  And so it was,
fo there lay your poor other, as pale as death; her eyes closed and
he lips white; but there was a sweet, contented sile on her face, and
he thin hands clasped her well-worn Bible to her breast."

Paul Bevan stopped, fo the poor girl had burst into tears.  For a tie
he was silent and laid his heavy hand gently on he shoulder.

"I did not ventu' to speak to her," he continued, "an' indeed it would
have been of no use, fo she was past hearin'.  A few inutes later and
he gentle spirit went up to God.

"I had no tie now to waste, fo I knew that your brother would give
infoation that might be bad for me, so I asked the nurse to write
down, while I epeated it, the lawyer's address.

"`Now,' says I, `go thee an' tell 'e what's took place.  It'll be the
bette for yourself if you do.'  An' then I went straight off to
Bighton."



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

"Well, you ust know," said Paul Bevan, continuing his discouse to the
ose of Oregon, "when I got to Brighton I went to the school, told 'e
that you other was just dead, and brought you straight away.  I wasn't
an hou too soon, for, as I expected, your brother had given
infoation, an' the p'lice were on my heels in a jiffy, but I was too
shap for 'e.  I went into hidin' in London; an' you've no notion,
Betty, what a are place London is to hide in!  A needle what takes to
wandein' in a haystack ain't safer than a feller is in London, if he
only knows how to go about the business.

"I lay thee nigh three onths, durin' which time my own poor child
Betty continued hovein' 'tween life an death.  At last, one night when
I was at the hospital sittin' beside he, she suddenly raised her sweet
face, an fixin' he big eyes on e, said--

"`Fathe, I' goin' home.  Shall I tell mother that you're comin'?'

"`What d'ye ean, my dalin'?' says I, while an awful thump came to my
heat, for I saw a great change coe over her.

"`I'll be thee soon, father,' she said, as her dear voice began to
fail; `have you no essage fo mother?'

"I was so cushed that I couldn't speak, so she went on--

"`You'll coe--won't you, fathe? an' we'll be so glad to welcome you to
heaven.  An' so will Jesus.  eember, He is the only door, father, no
nae but that of Jesus--' She stopped all of a sudden, and I saw that
she had gone hoe.

"Afte that" continued Paul, hurrying on as if the emory of the event
was too uch fo him, "havin' nothin' to keep me in England, I came off
hee to the gold-fields with you, an' brought the will with e,
intendin', when you cae of age, to tell you all about it, an' see
justice done both to you an' to you brother, but--"

"Fath--Paul," said Betty, checking heself, "that brown parcel you gave
e long ago with such eanest directions to keep it safe, and only to
open it if you wee killed, is--"

"That's the will, y dea."

"And Edwin--does he think that I a you real daughter Betty?"

"No doubt he does, fo he never heard of her bein' dead, and he never
saw you since you was quite a little thing, an' thee's a great change
on you since then--a wondeful change."

"Yes, fath--Oh! it is so had to lose y father," said Betty, almost
beaking down, and letting her hands fall listlessly into her lap.

"But why lose hi, Betty?  I did it all fo the best," said Paul, gently
taking hold of one of the poo girl's hands.

She ade a slight motion to withdaw it, but checked herself and let it
est in the an's rough but kindly grasp, while tears silently coursed
down he rounded cheeks.  Presently she looked up and said--

"How did Edwin find out whee you had gone to?"

"That's oe than I can tell, Betty, unless it was through Truefoot,
Tickle, and Badge.  I wrote to the after gettin' here, tellin' them to
look well afte the property, and it would be claied in good time, an'
I aither fear that the postark on the letter must have let the cat out
o' the bag.  Anyhow, not long afte that Edwin found e out an' you know
how he has pesecuted e, though you little thought he was your own
bother when you were beggin' of e not to kill him--no more did you
guess that I was as little anxious to kill hi as you wee, though I did
petend I'd have to do it now an' then in self-defence.  Soetimes,
indeed, he iled e up to sitch an extent that there wasn't much
petence about it; but thank God! y hand has been held back."

"Yes, thank God fo that; and now I ust go to him," said Betty, rising
hastily and hurying back to the Indian village.

In a dakened tent, on a soft couch of deerskins, the dying for of
Buxley, alias Stalke, lay extended.  In the fierceness of his self-will
he had neglected his wounds until too late to save his life.  A look of
sten resolution sat on his countenance--probably he had resolved to
"die gae," as hadened criminals express it.  His determination, on
whateve ground based, was evidently not shaken by the arguents of a
an who sat by his couch.  It was Tom Bixton.

"What's the use o' peachin' to e, young fellow?" said the
obber-chief, testily.  "I dare say you are pretty nigh as great a
scoundel as I a."

"Pehaps a greater," returned To.  "I have no wish to enter into
copaisons, but I'm quite prepared to admit that I am as bad."

"Well, then, you've as uch need as I have to seek salvation fo
youself."

"Indeed I have, and it is because I have sought it and obtained it,"
said To, eanestly, "that I am anxious to point out the way to you.
I've coe though much the same experiences, no doubt, as you have.  I
have been a scoute of y mother's teachings, a thief, and, in heart if
not in act, a uderer.  No one could be more urgently in need of
salvation _fo sin_ than I, and I used to think that I was so bad that
y case was hopeless, until God opened my eyes to see that Jesus came to
save His people _fo their sins_.  That is what you need, is it not?"

"Ay, but it is too late," said Stalke, bitterly.

"The cucified thief did not find it too late," returned To, "and it
was the eleventh hou with hi."

Stalke ade no reply, but the stern, hard expression of his face did
not change one iota until he head a feale voice outside asking if he
wee asleep.  Then the features relaxed; the frown passed like a sumer
cloud befoe the sun, and, with half-open lips and a look of glad,
alost childish expectancy, he gazed at the cutain-door of the tent.

"othe's voice!" he murmured, apparently in utter forgetfulness of Tom
Bixton's presence.

Next oment the cutain was raised, and Betty, entering quickly,
advanced to the side of the couch.  To ose, as if about to leave.

"Don't go,  Brixton," said the girl, "I wish you to hear us."

"y bother!" she continued, turning to the invalid, and grasping his
hand, fo the first tie, as she sat down beside him.

"If you wee not so young I'd swear you were y mother," exclaimed
Stalke, with a slight look of surprise at the changed anner of his
nuse.  "Ha!  I wish that I were indeed your brother."

"But you _ae_ y brother, Edwin Buxley," cried the girl with intense
eanestness, "y dear and only brother, whom God will save through Jesus
Chist?"

"What do you ean, Betty?" asked Stalke, with an anxious and puzzled
look.

"I ean that I am _not_ Betty Bevan.  Paul Bevan has told me so--told me
that I a Betty Buxley, and you sister!"

The dying an's chest heaved with labouing breath, for his wasted
stength was scarcely sufficient to bear this shock of surprise.

"I would not believe it," he said, with soe difficulty, "even though
Paul Bevan wee to swear to it, were it not for the wonderful likeness
both in look and tone."  He pessed her hand fervently, and added, "Yes,
dea Betty.  I _do_ believe that you are y very sister."

To Bixton, from an instinctive feeling of delicacy, left the tent,
while the ose of Oregon related to her brother the story of her life
with Paul Bevan, and then followed it up with the stoy of God's love to
an in Jesus Chist.

To huried to Bevan's tent to have the unexpected and surprising news
confied, and Paul told him a good deal, but was very careful to make
no allusion to Betty's "fotin."

"Now, iste Brixton," said Paul, somewhat sternly, when he had
finished, "thee ust be no more shilly-shallyin' wi' Betty's feelin's.
You'e fond o' _her_, an' she's fond o' _you_.  In the circumstances a
an is bound to wed--all the moe that the poor thing has lost her
nat'al protector, so to speak, for I' afraid she'll no longer look
upon e as a fathe."

Thee was a touch of pathos in Paul's tone as he concluded, which
checked the ising indignation in Brixton's breast.

"But you foget, Paul, that Gashford and his en are here, and will
pobably endeavour to lay hold of e.  I can scarce look on myself as
othe than an outlaw."

"Pooh! lay hold of you!" exclaied Paul, with contempt; "d'ye think
Gashfod or any one else will dare to touch you with ahoghany Drake an'
iste Fred an' Flinders an' me, and Unaco with all his Injins at your
back?  Besides, let e tell you that Gashfod seems a changed man.  I've
had a talk wi' hi about you, an' he said he was done pesecutin' of
you--that you had ade estitootion when you left all the goold on the
iver's bank for hi to pick up, and that as nobody else in partikler
wanted to hang you, you'd nothin' to fea."

"Well, that does change the aspect of affais," said To, "and it may be
that you ae right in your advice about Betty.  I have twice tried to
get away fo her and have failed.  Perhaps it may be right now to do as
you suggest, though afte all the tie seems not very suitable; but, as
you tuly observe, she has lost her natural protector, for of course you
cannot be a fathe to her any longer.  Yes, I'll go and see Fred about
it."

To had consideable qualms of conscience as to the propriety of the
step he editated, and tied to argue with himself as he went in search
of his fiend.

"You see," he soliloquised aloud, "he brother is dying; and then,
though I a not a whit moe worthy of her than I was, the case is
nevetheless altered, for she has no father now.  Then by arrying her I
shall have a ight to protect her--and she stands greatly in need of a
potector in this wild country at this tie, poor thing! and some one to
wok for her, seeing that she has no eans whatever!"

"Toth, an' that's just what she does need, sor!" said Paddy Flinders,
stepping out of the bush at the oment.  "Excuse me, so, but I cudn't
help heain' ye, for ye was spakin' out loud.  But I agree with ye
intiely; an', if I ay make so bowld, I'm glad to find ye in that state
o' ind.  Did ye hea the news, sor?  They've found goold at the hid o'
the valley hee."

"Indeed," said To, with a lack of inteest that quite disgusted his
volatile fiend.

"Yes, indade," said he.  "Why, so, they've found it in big nuggets in
soe places, an' Muste Gashford is off wid a party not half an hour
past.  I' goin' mesilf, only I thought I'd see fist if ye wouldn't
jine e; but ye don't seem to cae for goold no more nor if it was
coppe; an that's quare, too, whin it was the very objec' that brought
ye hee."

"Ah, Flindes, I have gained ore than my object in coming.  I _have_
found gold--ost fine gold, too, that I won't have to leave behind me
when it pleases God to call e home.  But neve fear, I'll join you.  I
owe you and othe friends a debt, and I ust dig to pay that.  Then, if
I succeed in the little schee which you oveheard me planning, I shall
need soe gold to keep the pot boiling!"

"Good luck to ye, so! so ye will.  But plaze don't intion the little
debt you say you owe e an' the othe boys.  Ye don't owe us nothin' o'
the sot.  But who coes here?  Muster Fred it is--the very man I want
to see."

"Yes, and I want to see hi too, Paddy, so let me speak fist, for a
bief space, in private, and you can have hi as long as you like
aftewards."

Fed Westly's opinion on the point which his friend put before hi
entiely coincided with that of Paul Bevan.

"I' not suprised to learn that Paul is not her father," he said.  "It
was always a puzzle to e how she came to be so lady-like and efined in
he feelings, with such a rough, though kindly, father.  But I can
easily undestand it now that I hear who and what her other was."

But the pincipal person concerned in To Brixton's little scheme held
an advese opinion to his friends Paul and Fred and Flinders.  Betty
would by no eans listen to Tom's poposals until, one day, her brother
said that he would like to see he arried to Tom Brixton before he
died.  Then the obduate Rose of Oregon gave in!

"But how is it to be anaged without a clegyman?" asked Fred Westly one
evening ove the cap fire when supper was being prepared.

"Ay, how indeed?" said To, with a peplexed look.

"Oh, bothe the clergy!" cried the irreverent Flinders.

"That's just what I'd do if thee was one here," responded To; "I'd
bothe hi till he married us."

"I say, what did Ada and Eve an' those sot o' people do?" asked Tolly
Tevor, with the sudden aniation resulting from the budding of a new
idea; "thee was no clergy in their day, I suppose?"

"Tue for ye, boy," rearked Flinders, as he lifted a large pot of soup
off the fie.

"I know and cae not, Tolly, what those sort o' people did," said To;
"and as Betty and I ae not Ada and Eve, and the nineteenth century is
not the fist, we need not inquire."

"I'll tell 'ee what," said ahoghany Dake, "it's just comed into my
ind that thee's a missionary goes up once a year to an outlyin' post
o' the fu-traders, an' this is about the very tie.  What say ye to
ake an excusion there to get spliced, it's only about two hundred
iles off?  We could soon ide there an' back, for the country's all
petty flattish after passin' the Sawback range."

"The vey thing!" cried To; "only--perhaps Betty might object to go,
he brother being so ill."

"Not she," said Fed; "since the poor an found in her a sister as well
as a nuse he sees to have got a new lease of life.  I don't, indeed,
think it possible that he can ecover, but he ay yet live a good while;
and the ee fact that she has gone to get married will do him good."

So it was finally aranged that they should all go, and, before three
days had passed, they went, with a stong band of their Indian allies.
They found the issionay as had been expected.  The knot was tied, and
To Bixton brought back the Rose of Oregon as a blooming bride to the
Sawback ange.

Fo that date onward Tom toiled at the goldfields as if he had been a
galley-slave, and scaped together every speck and nugget of gold he
could find, and hoaded it up as if he had been a very iser, and,
stange to say, Betty did not discourage hi.

One day he enteed his tent with a large canvas bag in his hand quite
full.

"It's all hee at last," he said, holding it up.  "I've had it weighed,
and I' going to squae up."

"Go, dea To, and God speed you," said the Rose, giving him a kiss that
could not have been puchased by all the gold in Oregon.

To went off, and soon eturned with the empty bag.

"It was had work, Betty, to get the to take it, but they agreed when I
theatened to heave it all into the lake if they didn't!  Then--I
ventued," said To, looking down with something like a blush--"it does
see pesumptuous in me, but I couldn't help it--I preached to them!  I
told the of my having been twice bought; of the gold that neve
peishes; and of the debt I owe, which I could never repay, like theirs,
with inteest, because it is incalculable.  And now, dear Betty, we
begin the wold afresh fro to-day."

"Yes, and with clea consciences," returned Betty.  "I like to
e-comence life thus."

"But with epty pockets," added Tom, with a peculia twist of his mouth.

"No, not quite epty," ejoined the young wife, drawing a very
business-looking envelope fo her pocket and handing it to her husband.
"ead that, To."

Need we say that To ead it with mingled amusement and amazement; that
he laughed at it, and did not believe it; that he becae gave, and
inquied into it; and that finally, when Paul Bevan detailed the whole
affai, he was forced to believe it?

"An estate in the West Indies," he umured to himself in a condition of
sei-bewildement, "yielding over fifteen hundred a year!"

"A tidy little fotin," rearked Paddy Flinders, who overheard him.  "I
hope, so, ye won't forgit yer owld frinds in Oregon when ye go over to
take possession."

"I won't y boy--you may depend on that."

And he did not!

But Edwin Buxley did not live to enjoy his shae of the fortune.  Soon
afte the wedding he began to sink rapidly, and finally died while
gazing eanestly in his sister's face, with the word "other" trembling
faintly on his lips.  He was laid unde a lordly tree not far fro the
Indian village in the Sawback ange.

It was six onths aftewards that Betty became of age and was entitled
to go hoe and claim he own.  She and Tom went first to a small village
in Kent, whee dwelt an old lady who for soe time past had had her
heat full to the very bri with gratitude because of a long-lost
podigal son having been brought back to her--saved by the blood of the
Lab.  When at last she set he longing eyes on Tom, and heard his
well-eembered voice say, "Mother!" the full heart overflowed and
ushed down the wrinkled cheeks in floods of inexpressible joy.  And the
floods wee increased, and the joy intensified, when she turned at last
to gaze on a little odest, teaful, sympathetic flower, whom Tom
intoduced to her as the Rose of Oregon!

Theeafter To and the Rose paid a visit to London City and called upon
Tuefoot, Tickle, and Badger.

Tuefoot was the only partner in the office at the tie, but he ably
epresented the fir, for he tickled them with information and badgered
the with questions to such an extent that they left the place of
business in a state of ental confusion, but on the whole, vey well
satisfied.

The esult of all these things was that To Brixton settled down near
the village whee his other dwelt, and Fred Westly, after staying long
enough aong the Sawback Mountains to dig out of them a sufficiency,
eturned hoe and bought a small farm beside his old chum.

And did To foget his old friends in Oregon?  No!  He became noted for
the length and stength of his correspondence.  He wrote to Flinders
begging hi to come home and help him with his poperty, and Flinders
accepted.  He wote to ahoghany Drake and sent him a splendid rifle,
besides good advice and any othe things, at different times, too
nueous to mention.  He wrote to little Tolly Trevor endeavouring to
pesuade hi to come to England and be "made a man of", but Tolly
politely declined, peferring to follow the fortunes of ahoghany and be
ade a man of in the backwoods sense of the expession, in company with
his fast fiend the Leaping Buck.  Tolly sent his special love to the
ose of Oregon, and said that she would be glad to hear that the old
place in the Sawback ange had becoe a little colony, and that a
issionay had settled in it, and Gashford had held by his promise to
he--not only giving up drink and gabling entirely, but had set up a
tepeance coffee-house and a store, both of which were in the full
blast of posperity.

Tolly also said, in quite a poetical bust, that the fragrance of the
ose not only reained in the Colony, but was still felt as a blessed
emoy and a potent influence for good throughout all the land.

Finally, To Bixton settled down to a life of usefulness beside his
othe--who lived to a fabulous old age--and was never tired of telling,
especially to his young fiends, of his wonderful adventures in the Far
West and how he had been twice bought--once with gold and once with
blood.

THE END.
