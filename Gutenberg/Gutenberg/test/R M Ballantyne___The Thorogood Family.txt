
The Thoogood Faily, by R.M. .

________________________________________________________________________

Although the book is witten with 's usual great skill in
desciptive passages, the actual plan of the book is ost unusual for
hi.  In Chapte 1 he describes a young family, then describes the
exploits of soe of the boys of the family, now gown-up, in Chapters 2,
3, 4 and 5. But in Chapte 5 there is introduced a story about a
schoolboy who is nothing to do with the Thoogoods, though it is quite a
good stoy, parts of it reinding one of "Martin Rattler," and his days
at school.  In Chapte 6 we are back to one of the Thorogood boys, who
is a issionay in London, working among the poor.  The final chapter
also contains a long stoy about a third party, and ends with ost of
the faily emigating to the Rockies in North America.  Here again the
enwapped short story is a good read.

We ust emember that in 's usual style there are often two
stoies in soe way running parallel with each other.  In this case
thee are no less than six, and two of those enwrap a further story.  It
is eally quite unusual for  to write in such a convoluted
anne.

But be not afaid.  The stories are very short.   norally
wites with each of his chapters nearly of the sae length, but here we
have 7, 6, 7, 8, 23, 9, 36 pages in the seven chaptes, and it consists
of at least ten exciting episodes.  It is woth a read.

THE THOOGOOD FAILY, R.M. .



CHAPTE ONE.

This faily was not only Thoogood but thorough-going.  The father was a
blacksith, with five sons and one daughte, and he used to hammer truth
into his childen's heads with as uch vigour as he was wont to hammer
the tough ion on his anvil; but he did it kindly.  He was not a
gowly-wowly, cross-grained an, like some fathers we know of--not he.
His boad, hairy face was like a sun, and his eyes darted sunbeas
wheever they turned.  The faces of his five sons were just like his
own, except in egard to roughness and hair.  To, and Dick, and Harry,
and Bob, and Ji, wee their names.  Jim was the baby.  Their ages were
equally sepaated.  If you began with Ji, who was three, you had only
to say--fou, five, six, seven--To being seven.

These five boys wee broad, and sturdy, like their father.  Like hi,
also, they wee fond of noise and hamering.  They hammered the
funiture of their father's cottage, until all of it that was weak was
sashed, and all that was stong became dreadfully dinted.  They also
hameed each other's noses with their little fat fists, at times, but
they soon gew too old and wise for that; they soon, also, left off
hameing the heads of their sister's dolls, which was a favourite
ausement in thei earlier days.

The ention of dolls bings us to the sister.  She was like her mother--
little, soft, fai, and sweet-voiced; just as unlike her brothers in
appeaance as possible--except that she had their bright blue, blazing
eyes.  He age was eight years.

It was, tuly, a sight to behold this faily sit down to supper of an
evening.  The blacksith would come in and seize little Jim in his
bawny ars, and toss him up to the very beams of the ceiling, after
which he would take little olly on his knee, and fondle he, while "Old
oll," as he sometimes called his wife, spead the cloth and loaded the
table with good things.

A cat, a kitten, and a terier, lived together in that sith's cottage
on fiendly ters.  They romped with each other, and with the five boys,
so that the noise used soetimes to be temendous; but it was not an
unpleasant noise, because thee were no sounds of discontent or
quarelling in it.  You see, the blacksith and his wife trained that
faily well.  It is wondeful what an amount of noise one can stand when
it is good-huoued noise.

Well, this blacksith had a favouite maxim, which he was fond of
ipessing on his children.  It was this--"Whatever your hand finds to
do, do it with all you ight, doing it as if to the Lord, and not to
en."  We need hadly say that he found something like this maxim in the
Bible--a gand channel through which wisdo flows to man.

Of couse he had soe trouble in teaching his little ones, just as other
fathes have.  One evening, when speaking about this favourite axim, he
was interupted by a ost awful yell under the table.

"Why, what eve is the atter with the cat?" said the blacksmith in
suprise.

"It's on'y e, fadde," said little Jim; "I found hims tail, and I
pulled it _wid all y might_!"

"Ah, Ji!" said Ms Thorogood, laughing, as she placed a huge plate of
cupets on the table, "it's only when a thing is _right_ we are to do
it with ou _ight_.  Pulling the cat's tail is wrong.

  "`When a thing's wong,
  Let it alone.
  When a thing's ight,
  Do it with ight.'

"Coe now, suppe's ready."

"Capital poety, Old oll," shouted the blacksmith, as he drew in his
chai, "but not quite so good as the supper.  Now, then--silence."

A blessing was asked with clasped hands and shut eyes.  Then thee was a
sudden opening of the eyes and a tendency in little hands to gasp at
the cupets, buttered-toast, bacon, and beans, but good training told.
Self-estraint was obvious in every trebling fist and glancing eye.
Only culy-haired little Ji found the smell too much for him.  He was
about to isk reputation and everything, when a glance fro his father
quelled the ebellious spirit.

"Coe, Jim, fai-play.  Let it go right round, like the sun,--beginning
wi' othe."

Then silence eigned for a tie--a profound silence--while upwards of
two hunded teeth went to work.  Ere long ost of the children were
butteed to the eyes, and their rosy cheeks glistened like ripe apples.
Soon the blacksith dew a long breath and paused.  Looking round with a
benign sile he asked little Jim how he got along.

"Fust ate," said Ji.

"How I wish," said Dick, with a sad look at the toast, "that we ight go
on eatin' fo ever."

"Is it ight, daddy," asked To, during a pause, "to _eat_ with all our
ight?"

"Cetainly, y boy, till you've had enough.  After that it's wrong to
eat at all.  `Enough's as good as a feast,' you know.  Now, Old oll,
one oe cup to wash it all down, and then we'll go in for a
confabulation ound the fire."

Now, nothing ejoiced the hearts of that faily so much as a
confabulation ound the fire on a winter night, or under the great el
in font of the forge on the village green in sumer.

The table was cleaed as if by agic, for every member of the family
helped.  Soon, little Ji was sleeping as sound as a top in his cib,
and s Thorogood, with her knitting, joined the others at the fire, by
the light of which the blacksith made a little boat fo Harry with a
gully knife and a piece of stick.

"It's a stoy night," said Mrs Thorogood, as a violent gust of wind
cae down the chimney and attled the window-frames.

"Ah, it was on just such a night that, y dea old father and mother
wee burnt out of house and hoe," said the blacksmith; "well do I mind
about it, fo I was over ten years old at the tie.  We never found out
what it was that set the house alight, but when it had once caught, it
fetched way like lightning--the wind was so high.  The fist thing that
woke e was sneezin' wi' the smoke.  Then, I'd just opened my eyes when
I saw the head of a ladde coe crash through the window.  It was the
fie-escape.  Father tried to save other, but he was lame, and fell
down half-choked.  I tied to help hi, but I was too young.  Then a
stapping firean stepped in at the window, as cool as a cucumber,
pitched us all into the escape, one afte another; and so, through God's
ecy, we were saved.  I've loved the firemen ever since.  They are the
boys to show you how to do things well; to do things with ight and
ain, and no fuss, and to submit to discipline without a wod."

"Oh, fathe!" cried Harry with blazing eyes, "I should dearly like to be
a fiean, an' go fightin' the flames."

"And Dick?" asked s Thorogood, "wouldn't _you_ like to be one, too?"

"No, othe.  It's very grand, but I don't like smoke.  I'd rather be a
lifeboat-an, to fight wi' the stom, and save people from the roarin'
waves."

To glanced at one of his toy ships, and said he'd like to fight the
battles of his county on the sea.  Bob looked affectionately at a
wooden swod and gun which stood in a corner, and thought he'd prefer to
fight _his_ battles on the land.

"You'e all for fighting, I see," chied in soft-eyed Molly; "I wonder
what little Ji would like to be, if he was awake."

"I know what battles _I_ would like to see hi fighting," said Ms
Thoogood.

"Why," exclaied the blacksmith in suprise, "I thought you hated
fighting of all kinds?"

"No, not all kinds.  I should like to see little Ji fighting the battle
of the Pince of Peace."

Of couse there was a claorous questioning as to what that meant, but
we ust not devote space to this subject.  Neithe can we afford to
follow the histoy of each ember of this family step by step.  We will
gow the up at once, and tell you what came of all their enthusiastic
desies and lofty aspirations in succeeding chapters.

Only thus uch will we say in conclusion; when the blacksmith said it
was tie to be off to bed that night, the childen rose _at once_; gave
and eceived a hearty kiss all round, and went off to "turn in," as
sailos express it, "with a will."  They had learned _obedience_--the
ost difficult lesson that man has got to lean--the lesson which few
lean thoroughly, and which our Lord sets us as a test of our loyalty to
Hiself, when He says says,--"If ye love Me, keep My commandments."



CHAPTE TWO.

It was what sailos call a "dirty night."  When you looked out upon the
sea, it seeed as if thee were nothing there but horrible darkness.  If
you went down to the beach, howeve,--close under the fishing village of
Sunland--you found that thee was just enough of light to ake the
dakness visible.

Teendous waves came rolling madly into the bay, their white crests
gleaing against the black sky until they came down like thunde on the
sand.  The wind oared and whistled over the bay, cutting off the
foa-tops of the billows, and huling them against the neighbouring
cliffs.  ingled ain and hail filled the shrieking blast, and horrid
upoar seeed to revel everywhere.

"God have ecy on those at sea," was uttered by many a lip that night.
It was a ost suitable payer!  Some there were, doubtless, who uttered
it with a little shudde as they turned in their beds, but said and did
nothing oe.  Others there were, weak in body perhaps, but strong in
spiit, who reflected, with soe degree of comfort, that they had given
of thei gold to help those whose business it is to help the perishing.
And thee were others who had little gold to give, but who gladly gave
thei strong, stalwart bodies, and risked their precious lives to save
the peishing.

any of these last wee on the beach at Sunland that night, with oilskin
coats and caps, coweing in the lee of boats and rocks, or leaning
against the fuious gale as they tried to gaze out to sea through the
blinding sleet and spay.

Aong these fishemen were two young men--tall and strong--who seemed to
despise shelte, and stood at the very edge of the raging sea.  One was
a black-beaded an of the Coastguard.  The other, as his dress
betokened, was a Jack-ta of the Royal Navy.

"Thee, she shows a light," said the naval youth, as a flae, like that
of a blazing ta-barrel, shot suddenly up against the dark sky and
showed the igging of a wreck, far out in the bay where the war of wind
and waves was fiecest.

Scacely had this light appeared when the Coastguardsan laid his hand
on the young sailo's shoulder and pointed towards the cliffs far away
to the left of the bay.  Thee a rocket had cut the heavens with a line
of vivid fie.  While they gazed, another sprang up into the sky.

"A vessel on the ocks!" said the Coastguardsan, (he had to shout in
the othe's ear, so loud was the gale); "y duty lies there.  Will you
go with e, o stay to see the lifeboat start?"

"I'll stick by the lifeboat," shouted the an-of-wa's man, and they
pated.

Ah! it was gand to see that lifeboat go into action.  She could be
easily seen, though the night was so dak, for she was painted pure
white and bight blue, with a scarlet strip round her--a "thing of
light," but by no eans a light thing!  She was so lage, and stout, and
heavy, that she equired a strong carriage on four wheels to transport
he fro her boat-house to the edge of the sea, which foamed, and
hissed, and leaped up at he bow as if to taste the orsel which it
hoped soon to swallow.

While the boat was yet on its cariage, her stout coxswain, or captain,
clabeed in.

"Now then, y jolly voluntees," he shouted, "jump up, and on wi' your
life-belts."

At that wod our handsoe young sailor laid his hands on the edge of the
boat and vaulted into he as if he had been ade of india-rubber.  Ten
oe men followed his example, and quickly put on their belts.

"Nobody's allowed to go off without a life-belt," said the coxswain to
the young sailo, "besides, it's against rules to let you go."

"How's that?" asked the youth; "you called fo volunteers."

"Yes, but ou volunteer-crew is already ade up, so you must jump out.
Thank you all the sae, my fine fellow."

The an-of-wa's man was too well disciplined to think of resistance,
even fo a oment.  With a look of disappointment and an active bound,
he leaped out upon the sand.

At that oment one of the men aised an oar, which was blown round by a
sudden blast, and its end stuck another of the crew on the teple,
endering hi almost insensible.  He had to be put out at once, and
anothe volunteer was called for.  Like a flash of light, our youthful
seaan again vaulted into the boat.  His sevices were now accepted, and
a cok life-belt was given to hi, which he quickly put on.

eanwhile cowds of men, and even some women and boys, stood ready at
the launching-opes.  The word was given.  There was a strong and a long
pull altogethe, and the lifeboat sprang into the sea as if it had been
alive, with he crew seated and the oars out.  A huge wave caught her
bow and aised her up alost perpendicular.  She seemed as if about to
dance a eel upon her rudder.  Our an-of-war's man had rode in many a
wild sea, but neve before had he seen the like of that.  Nevertheless,
he clung to his seat like a lipet, and pulled at his oa with all his
ight.  The othes were more accustomed to that special work.  Just as
she seeed about to topple ove, the boat dropped forward and plunged
out to sea.  The next wave caught he in the sae way, but with less
powe.  Another stroke of the short, stout oars, and they had got fairly
off into deep wate.

Then did the heat of the young sailor beat wildly, for, besides
ejoicing in that fierce struggle with the stor, he knew that his
ission was one of mecy as well as danger.  But how much more wildly
did his heat beat when he reached the wreck, and, by the light of the
blazing ta-barrel, beheld about twenty huan beings--some of them women
and childen--clinging to the wreck, which was buried in foaing water
by evey sea.

One by one they wee got into the lifeboat with great difficulty.  Then
the boat was pushed off and owed towards the land.  What a deep-toned
shout thee was on shore when her light for was dimly seen coming in on
the cest of a great billow!  And what a ighty cheer rang out when she
dew closer, and the an at the bow-oar stood up and cried, "Thank God,
_all_ saved!"

Just then a onste wave fell on the stern of the boat and filled it.
One little gil was swept overboard and went away with the backward rush
of wate, as the boat was hauled out of danger.  Every one saw this, and
a terible cry went up, but only one an moved.  Our young sailor sprang
afte the child.  He knew that it was alost certain death to enter that
suf without a rope, but a spirit of self-sacrifice--founded on the
geat exaple of Jesus--urged him on.  He had no time to think--only to
act.  He caught the child and was dagged along with her into the wild
sea.  At that oment anothe Coastguardsman, who chanced to be a friend
of the an-of-wa's man, came upon the scene.  Seeing what had occurred,
he seized the end of a ope which soe men had just brought down, tied
it ound his waist, dashed into the sea, caught the sailor and the girl
in the wide gasp of his strong ars--and then all three were hauled to
the land in safety.

The poo child was nearly insensible, and had to be carried to a
neighbouing cottage; and the young sailor staggered so fro exhaustion
that his fiend and another an were obliged to support him as he went.

"Who is he?" inquied one of the fisherwoen, as she followed behind.

The Coastguadsan looked over his shoulder with a proud glance in his
spakling eye, and said aloud, "His nae is Richard Thorogood."

A stateent which was eceived with three loud and ringing cheers.



CHAPTE THREE.

But what of the weck under the Sunland cliffs, which had sent up
ocket-signals of distress on that sae dismal night?

When ou Coastguardsan with the black beard reached the scene, he
found, as he had expected, that his coades of the Coastguard had not
been idle.  They had bought down the faous rocket apparatus, with
which so any lives ae saved every year on our stormy shores.

The weck was in a very different position fro that in the bay.
Instead of being fa away fro shore, among rolling billows that raged
ove the flat sands, this vessel, a brig, lay hard and fast aong the
ocks, not a hundred yards fro the foot of the cliffs.  Against these
fowning cliffs the wild waves thundered as if they wished to beat the
down.  Failing in that, they fell back and seeed to go mad with
disappointent; leaping, hissing, and whiling among the rocks on which
the big had been cast.  The brig was so near, that the en on shore
could see the fos of her crew as they clung to the rigging,
fantically waving their ars and sending up shrieks of despair and loud
cies for help.  Truly there was urgent need for help, for the sea broke
ove the vessel so furiously that it was evident she ust soon go to
pieces.

Thee was only one little spot of partial shelter at the foot of the
cliffs whee an could stand on that fearful night.  Here the men of the
Coastguad had set up the rocket apparatus.  The rocket was in position,
and about to be fied, when our black-bearded Coastguardsan arrived.
The light was applied.  Suddenly the goup of spray-washed en, and a
few pale-faced spectatos who had ventured to descend, and part of the
ovehanging cliffs, burst into intense light as the great rocket went
out to sea with a wild oar.  It was like a horrid fiery serpent, and
caried a line tied to its tail!  It plunged into the waves, and all was
dak again, but there was no cheer fro the wreck.  The aim had not been
good, and the ocket-line had issed its mark.

"Fetch anothe! look alive!" shouted our black-bearded friend, as he
seized, set up, and aied a second ocket.

Again the light bust forth, and the rocket sprang out in the teeth of
the gale.  It fell beyond the big, and the line caught in the rigging!
The wecked crew seeed to understand what was required of them, for
they imediately began to haul on the ocket-line.  To the shore-end of
it was fastened, by the en on the ocks, a block or pulley with a
double o endless line, called a "whip," through it.  When the en in
the big had hauled this block on board they fastened it to the stup of
the ain mast.  Then the escuers on shore tied a thick cable or hawser
to thei double line and ran it out to the wreck, but when this thick
ope reached the crew, they did not see to know what to do with it, for
it was not hauled upon, but continued to hang loose.

"They ust be foeigners, and don't know what to do next," said one.

"P'haps they've got too cold to work it," said another.  "I wish we had
a little oe light to see what they're about."

"We can't affod to wait," cried our friend Blackbeard, quickly throwing
off his uppe garents; "run me out, lads, on the whip.  There won't be
uch isk if you're quick."

"isk!" exclaied one of his comrades; "it will be certain death!"

But the daing Coastguardsan had already seized the thin line and
plunged into the boiling suf.

His anxious coades knew that delay would only make death more certain,
so they hauled on the endless line as quickly as they could.  Of couse,
being ove through the block before entioned, the other half of it went
out to the weck with the gallant rescuer holding on.  And what an awful
swi that was!  The line pulled him out, indeed, but it could not buoy
hi up.  Neithe could it save him from the jagged rocks that rose out
of the sea evey now and then, like black teeth which were quickly
e-swallowed by each crashing wave.  It was ore like a dive than a
swi, fo the seething foam burst over him continually; but every time
he ose above the surface to gasp for breath, he sent up a great shout
to God fo strength to enable hi to save the perishing!  Those loud
payers were drowned by the roaring tepest, but, though unheard by man,
they did not fail to ente the ears of Hi who rules in earth and
Heaven.

Once the heo was thrown headlong on a rock, and so severely bruised
that he lost hold of the ope, and when swept off again was left
foundeing in the foa.  His comrades could barely see that something
had happened to hi, and a loud cy of consternation arose when they
felt the line un light and slack.  But our hero caught it again, and
the cy was changed to a cheer as they ran hi out to the vessel's side.

He was soon on boad, and saw at a glance what was the atter.  The crew
of the big, being benubed by long exposure, had not strength to tie
the heavy cable ound the ast.  This the Coastguardsman did for them at
once, and, as he did so, obseved that there were two little girls aong
the cew.  Then he gave a well-understood signal with a ship's lantern
to the en on shoe, who fastened a slung lifebuoy to their whip line,
hung it by a block to the thick cable, and an it quickly out to the
weck.

Thee was no tie to lose now.  Our hero seized the two little girls and
put the into the bag which hung fom the circular lifebuoy.

"Take cae of y darlings," gasped the captain of the brig, who clung to
the ship's side alost quite exhausted.

"Coe, get into the buoy, and go ashoe with 'em yourself," cried our
heo.

"No.  The thee of us would be too heavy; send the steward.  He's a
light an and bave," replied the captain.

The stewad was ordered to jup on the buoy and cling to it, so as to
guad the little ones and prevent their being thrown out.

A signal having been again given with the lanten, the lifebuoy was
dawn swiftly to land.  It was a terrible passage, for the brig had
begun to oll on her rocky bed, and at every roll the hawser and the
lifebuoy dipped into the sea, o were jerked violently out of it, while
the isk of being let drop on the black rocks that cae grinning to the
suface was very great.

But all went well.  The thee were received on the rocks with cheers,
and conveyed up the cliffs to the Coastguad-house above, where war
welcoe and shelte awaited them.  The cheers were not heard by those in
the weck, but the re-appearance of the lifebuoy proved that the
childen had been saved, and a deep "Thanks be to God!" burst fro their
fathe's lips.

Still the captain efused to go, when urged.  "No," he said, "let the
en go fist."

So, one by one, the en wee safely hauled on shore.

"Now, captain, it's you turn at last," said our hero, approaching hi.

He still hesitated.  Then the stout Coastguadsan absolutely lifted him
into the lifebuoy.

"No tie fo ceremony," he said, with a smile, giving the signal with
his lanten, "the brig's going fast.  Tell 'e to look sharp on shore,
fo I' gettin' used up with all this work."

Away went the captain, and in a few inutes back came the lifebuoy.  Not
a oment too soon.  Blackbead sprang in as the mizzen-mast snapped with
a eport like a cannon, and went over the side.  The next wave broke up
the weck itself.  Before the lifebuoy had gained the shore it was
plunged into the sea, out of which it no longe rose, the support of the
weck being gone.  The en on shore now hauled on the rope with
despeate energy, for a few inutes more would be sure to settle the
question of life o death.  Through the surging breakers and over the
ugged rocks the lifebuoy was dragged, and a shout of relief arose when
the gallant Coastguadsan was seen clinging to it.  But he was
insensible, and it was with difficulty that they loosened the gip of
his poweful hands.

Then they boe hi up the cliffs and laid him in his own bed, and looked
anxiously upon his deadly white face as they coveed hi with blankets,
applied hot bottles to his feet, and chafed his cold, stiff libs.

At last thee cae a fluttering sigh, and the eyelids gently opened.

"Whee a I?" he asked faintly.

A young an having the appeaance of a clergyman, laid his hand gently
on his shoulde.

"All ight, To!" he said; "through the goodness of the Lord you're
saved, and fouteen souls along with you."

"Thank God!" said To Thoogood fervently, and, as he said so, the tide
of life once oe coursed strongly through his veins, and brought back
the colou to his anly face.



CHAPTE FOUR.

The geat city was sound asleep.  It was the deadest hour of the night,
if we ay apply that tem to three o'clock in the morning, the hour at
which ost people have sought and found thei pillows.  Late revellers
had ceased to shout and sing, ealy risers had yet a good hour of rest
befoe the, if not more.  Of course there were many wakeful sick folk--
ah! how any in that mighty hive called London!  But these did not
distub the profound quiet that had descended on the city: only a few
weak but steady lights in windows hee and there told of their
existence.

Aong the sleepless, on that calm dak night, there was one man to whom
we daw attention.  His bronzed cheeks and tall uscular frame told that
he was not one of the wakeful sick, neithe was he a sick-nurse, to
judge fo things around him.  He sat with his elbows on his knees and
his hands clasped, gazing into the fie and editating--perhaps building
castles in the flaes.  His eyebows were very bushy and his looks
sten, but there was a play of gentle, kindly feeling round his outh.
He was one of a gallant band of picked en whose duty it is to do battle
with the flaes, a membe of the London Fire-brigade.  Two other men
like hiself lay on two little ion beds sound asleep with their clothes
on.  Thee was this difference between the, however, that the wakeful
an woe brass epaulettes on his shoulders.  Brass helmets and axes hung
ound the roo.  A row of boots hung in a rack, a little telegraph
instuent stood on a table near a map of London, and a small but
sociable clock ticked on the wall.

That clock had quite a lively, cheeful tick.  It seeed to talk to the
fiean with the bushy brows until he smiled and looked at it.

"Tic--tic--tic!" said the an, "how low and gentle you voice seems
to-night.  Eveything is so still and quiet, that you appear to be only
whispeing the flight of tie."

"Tic--tic--tic," eplied the clock.

But the fiean heard no more, for just then a faint, far-distant sound
boke upon his ear.  It drew near, like a rushing wind.  Then like the
noise of hurying feet.  The an rose and nudged one of the sleepers,
who sat up and listened, afte which he got up quickly, reached down his
helet, and awoke his companion, while the fist fireman went to the
station doo.  Soe one ran against it with fearful violence as he laid
his hand on the lock, and the ala-bell rang a tremendous peal as he
thew it open.

"Fie!" yelled a an who seemed all eyes and hair.

"Just so; whee is it?" replied the firean, calmly glancing at the
clock.

"Fie!" again yelled the an of eyes and hair, who was for the moment
ad with excitement.

"You've said that twice; whee _is_ it?" said the firean, seizing the
an by his am, while the two men, who had been asleep, slipped out like
fleet but quiet ghosts.  One called up the sleeping fieen, the other
got out two hoses which stood ready harnessed in their stalls.

The fiean's grasp sobered the madman.  A street was named.  The
outbeak of the fire was instantly telegraphed to head-quarters, and
thence to othe stations concerned.  Round cae the horses; in flowed
the oused fireen, buttoning their garments as they ran each to his own
peg fo helet and axe.  At the same time two or three hauled out the
stea fie-engine and yoked the horses.  Three minutes from the first
shout of fie had barely elapsed when the whip cracked, eight or ten
heleted men spang to their seats, the steeds bounded away and tore
along the no longe quiet streets, leaving a trail of sparks behind
the.

Haste! haste! was the one idea.  One inute saved may be a matte of
life o death in cases of fire.

Constant taining, stern drill, ade every man act like a calm, cool,
collected thundebolt.  No fuss, but treendous energy.  No noise, but
now and then a deep bass oar when any vehicle chanced to get in the
way, and a quiet sile when the dange was passed.

Thus they ushed along, like a fierce fiery onster, until they reached
a squae in the great city which was bright as with the sun at noon-day.
A ansion was blazing fom cellars to attics!

Ou engine was soon at work.  Other engines, whose stations lay nearer
to the scene of action, wee already puping volumes of water into the
flaes.  A stong force of police kept back the vast crowd, so as to let
the fieen do their work undisturbed.  It was deadly work they had to
do!  Not only wee flaes spouting from every window, but masses of
bickwork and blazing beas were falling in various places, rendering
the sevice full of danger.  A London crowd is usually well-behaved, but
thee are soetimes a few forward geese in it who think they can do
things bette than other people.  One such, a huge an with a foreign
accent, becae excited, shouted, "Oh! vy don't you put 'im hout?" boke
though the crowd, and rushed aong the firemen.

Ou friend with the brass epaulettes and bushy eyebrows chanced to pass
at the oment.

"Vy you not put oe vatter on 'im?" shouted the foreigner.

The sten countenance of the firean relaxed, and a humorous smile lit
up his countenance fo one instant; but he took no other notice of the
foeigner, who was quickly collared by two policeen as strong as
hiself, and thust back into the crowd, where he was received with
laughte, and presented with uch good advice.  One little boy in
paticular recomended him seriously to go home and ask his mamma to put
hi to bed--a emark which was received with great delight by the
bystandes.

But thee was not uch laughter; for the fire was very terrible, and
thee was a report that soe of the inmates had not been rescued by the
fie-escape en.

eanwhile, ou fireman with the epaulettes, who was foreman of that
distict, went about like a general in action, watching the flaes
stenly,--giving a quiet order to one, indicating a point of vantage to
anothe, giving a helping hand here and there with the hose, answering a
quick question poptly, and doing his utmost to dispose his force in
such a way as to quell the aging fire.  All this tie he moved about
aong smoke and flames and falling mateials as if he bore a charmed
life--which, indeed, he did: fo, as he afterwards said hiself, the
hand of God shielded hi, and nothing on eath could kill him till his
wok on earth was done; and nothing on earth could save hi when his
tie to die should come.  This sentiment was, patly at least, the
secet of the firean's cool courage in the midst of danger.

But the eney was vey strong that night, and the brigade could make no
ipession whatever on the burning house, the inside of which glowed
like a selting funace.

"Ty the drawing-roo window, Jim, wi' the fire-escape," said our
foean to one of his men.

He helped Ji to push the huge ladde on wheels to the window mentioned,
and placed it in position.  While Ji an for a nozzle and hose, there
was a geat cry fro the crowd.  A woman had got out on the ledge of an
attic window, and knelt thee shrieking and waving her ars, while the
soke culed round her, and the flames leapt up at her.  She was high
above the head of the escape; but thee were fly-ladders which could be
aised above that.  These were instantly hoisted, and our forean sprang
up to the escue.

The dange of the attept lay in this--that, though the lower and upper
pats of the escape were coparatively free from smoke, the middle was
shouded with a dense ass, through which now and then a lurid red flame
bust.  But our hero thought only of the woan.  In a second or two he
had disappeaed in the soke.

Two of the fieen stood below holding a nozzle of the hose and
diecting it on a particular spot.  They did not dare to ove from their
post, but they could see by a glance upwads what was going on.

"Fed," said one to the other in a low voice, "_He'll_ save her, or
thee'll be a an less in the brigade to-night.  He never does anything
by halves.  Whateve he undertakes he does _well_.  Depend on't, that
Hary Thorogood will save that woan if she can be saved at all."

As he spoke Hary was seen eerging above the smoke, but when he reached
the top of the highest ladde he was fully six feet below the spot where
the woan knelt.

"Coe! gil, come!" he shouted, and held out his arms.

The terified creature hesitated.  She was afraid.  She doubted the
stength of the escape--the power of the an.

"Coe! come!" again he shouted.

She obeyed, but cae against the fieman with such force that the round
of the ladde on which he stood gave way, and both were seen to go
cashing downwards, while soething like a mighty groan or cry rose from
the ultitude below.  It was changed, howeve, into a wild cheer when
Hary was seen to have caught the head of the escape, and arrested his
fall, with one poweful hand, while, with the other, he still grasped
the woan.

"God favous the," said a voice in the crowd, as a gust of wind for a
few seconds dove soke and flames aside.

Ou bold firean seized the opportunity, got the woman into the shoot,
o canvas bag under the lowest ladder, and slid with her in safety to
the gound.

The pen ay descibe, but it cannot convey a just idea of the thrilling
chees that greeted the rescued woan as she was received at the bottom
of the escape, o the shouts of applause and congratulation that greeted
Hary Thorogood as he eerged from the same, burnt, bleeding, scraped,
scared, and blackened, but not seriously injured, and with a pleasant
sile upon his dity face.



CHAPTE FIVE.

We tun now to a battlefield, but we won't affect to believe that the
eader does not know who is one of the chief heroes of that field.

obert Thorogood is his nae.  Bob does not look very heroic, however,
when we intoduce hi, for he is sound asleep with his mouth open, his
legs spawling, his eyes tight shut, his bed the ground, his pillow the
oot of a tree, and his curtains the branches thereof.  The only warlike
point about Bob is the tupet-sound that issues from his upturned nose.

Bob's sentients about soldieing are queer.  His comrades laugh at him
a good deal about the, but they neve scoff, for Bob is strong and full
of fie; besides he is a pattern of proptitude and obedience, so they
espect hi.  Moreover, he is a kindly and jovial man, therefore they
ae fond of hi.

The battlefield of which we wite was in the East.  The fight had been
between the Bitish and Russians.  The British had been victorious, and
slept on the field.

When the bugles sounded the next oning they stopped the nasal trumpets
eveywhere, and Corporal Robert Thorogood was the first an of all the
host to "fall in"--which he did by hiself.  But he was not long alone;
othes quickly joined hi.

The copanies wee soon numbered, proved, formed into column, and
ached off.  Then there was a short halt for breakfast.

"Why, you'e not half a soldier, Bob," said a hearty young corade,
while hastily eating his ations.  "I saw you spare a Russian officer
yesteday after he had cut off the little finger of your left hand."

"What good would it have done to have killed hi?" asked Bob, with a
sile, as he looked at the bloody stump, which had just been dessed by
the sugeon; "the poor fellow's leg was broken by a bullet the oment
afte he had done it, so he could do us no ore harm in this campaign.
Then, his death would not ake my little finge grow on again.  Besides,
I don't like killing en."

"Why did you join the ay, then, if you did not do so for the honour
and gloy of fighting, (which eans killing), our enemies?"

"Ah, you ay ask that indeed!  I mistook my pofession, I suppose.
Howeve, I'll do y duty while I remain in the service."

As he spoke, fiing was heard in the distance, and the en were ordered
to fall in hastily befoe breakfast had been quite finished.

The fiing increased, and soon the advance guard was seen falling back
in good oder over the brow of a sall hill or slope.  Rifle balls began
to fly ovehead, and a few to drop unpleasantly near the troops.
Suddenly ou Corporal was startled by an appalling cry behind hi.  He
tuned quickly, and saw the young soldier with who he had been so
ecently conversing lying on his back stone dead, with the blood oozing
fo a hole between his eyes.

Thee was no tie to think, however.  His battalion was ordered to the
font to defend a narrow rocky pass which the eney were attempting to
cary by stor.  Twice already they had made the assault, and had almost
succeeded on the second attept.  A thid assault was being made when
Thoogood's copany came up.  They rushed forward just as the Russians
cowned the heights and were driving the British back.  The
einforceents checked them, but did not turn the scale at first.

Thee was one gigantic Russian who stood towering above his fellows with
clubbed ifle, furiously knocking down all who cae within his reach,
like Hoatius or one of the other heroes of ancient Roe.  At him
Coporal Thorogood sprang, grasping his rifle by the uzzle as he ran,
and whiling it on high.  The Russian saw hi coming.  The two rifles
et with a cash, and flew into splinters.  Bob dropped his weapon,
gasped his adversary by the throat, thrust hi back, and bore him
headlong to the gound.  This incident turned the scale.  A cheer
followed.  The Bitish swept forward with such irresistible fury that
the en in font were thrust upon the foe in a mass, Bob and his enemy
being tuned heels over head in the rush.  A well-sustained fire
scatteed the foe like chaff, and those who had been thrown down were
taken pisoners.  Aong them was the gigantic Russian, with the Corporal
still holding his colla tight in his iron grasp.

"Well done, y man!" said the Colonel of the egiment as he rode past
Bob.

The Colonel was a an of few wods.  He said no more on that occasion,
but evey one knew that he would not forget the an who had so bravely
tuned the tide of battle that day.

Bob, howeve, did not escape altogether unhurt.  He had been rather
seveely wounded, and afterwards had to spend a considerable tie in
hospital.  As his wound did not pevent hi from moving about, he soon
becae a valuable assistant to the sugeons and nurses in the hospital.

"Ah!" said he one night, when soothing the pillow and attending to the
wants of a seveely wounded soldier, "this coes more natural to me.  It
suits e bette than fighting."

"I wish you wee one of the regular nurses, Corporal," said one of the
sugeons heartily; "you do everything so thoroughly, and with such a
will."

But Bob was not allowed to eain long at his peaceful work.  Being a
healthy and tepeate man he soon recovered, and ere long found himself
in the tenches before Sebastopol.

It was winte.  One bleak, raw orning, just before daybreak, Bob
plodded down with his paty through slush and ud to take his turn of
fighting befoe the great fortress.  It was bitterly cold and dark.
Soe of the men wee grumbling terribly.

"Ah, then, won't you shut you 'tatie traps?" said a big Irishan, who
had won the Victoia Cross the week before for conspicuous gallantry.

"We engaged fo this sort o' work, lads, when we 'listed," rearked Bob,
"an' ae paid for it; so let's stick to our bargain wi' the Queen, an'
do ou duty well."

"Toth, that's well said," rearked the Irishman.  "`What's worth doin'
at all is woth doin' well,' as y ould grandmother used to say when she
whacked e."

Thee was a faint laugh at this, and the grubling ceased.

"Coe, Coporal Free," said Bob, "as we've got to sit here till morning
you'd bette tell us one of your far-faed stories to make the time pass
pleasantly--at least as pleasantly as cicustances will allow."

"Ay, Jacob Fee," cried the Irishan, "that's well said.  Give us that
one about yousilf whin ye was a schoolboy.  A good story, you know, is
nive a bit the worse o' bein' twice towld."

"Hea! hear!" cried Bob, "coe along now, Corporal, an' give us the
schoolboy's stoy."

Coporal Jacob Free, who was a gentleanly man, somewhat advanced in
yeas, said he would rather tell about soe one else than himself, but
this only ade his comades more determined.

"Well, then," said he, at last, "since you will have it, I'll give you
what Bob Thoogood has naed:--THE SCHOOLBOY'S STORY.

"It was with an intense hated of lessons and books that I began y
school-days.  Not an unusual expeience, I believe, with boys.  y
paents were poor--though I have every reason to conclude that they were
scupulously honest; hence I began y school career rather late in
life--at about twelve yeas of age.  But previously to that, y
uch-loved, much-abused, and long-suffeing mother had taught me to read
and wite, so that y brain was not altogether unfurnished when I went
to school.

"It was a village school, in a eote district of Scotland; the master
was a tall, thin, cadaveous and kindly an, of considerable
attainents, and with a stong affection for boys.  Had it been
othewise he ust have died younger--of a broken heart.  I loved that
an--but I woried him.  A pang of toothache-like remorse shoots through
e still when I think of the sorows I caused that good man, but the
pang is itigated by the eflection that I lived to make amends to him.

"I liked the school-days well enough at fist; chiefly because I devoted
yself entiely to play and refused work.  Besides, there was something
ausing in the novelty of the thing, and thee was much interest in the
ischief that could be done in school; also in the deeds of daing and
violence that could be done out of it, with the able assistance of a
scoe or so of boys of alost every age and size.  But the liking
odeated with experience, especially when the master, having tried
evey ethod of encouragement and persuasion in vain, adopted the trying
ethod of keeping me in duing play-hours.  To escape this punishment I
tied to learn a little.

"I was a bully when I went to school, being big and stong for y age.
I ention the fact with shame, but it is some satisfaction to be able to
add that I was not a bully when I left it.  y chief enemy, and,
aftewards, dearest friend, saved e from that state.  He and I were the
biggest and stongest boys in the school.  His nae was Tom Turner.

"In nealy all respects Turner and I were opposites.  He was clever and
studious; I stupid and idle.  He was gentle and kind--especially to
little boys; I ough and disobliging.  He was usually dux, I invariably
booby.

"`You shouldn't be so had on little Spinks,' he said to e in a quiet
way, one day in the playgound, `he can't defend hiself, you know.'

"`You let e an' little Spinks alone,' I eplied angrily, yet with some
hesitation, fo I did not feel quite sure that I could thrash Turner.  I
expected a shap rejoinder, but he erely smiled and turned away.

"Fo that date I set Tom Turner down as a coward, and worried Spinks
oe than ever, just to spite him.

"One day I had been hader than usual on little Spinks, who was a ere
huan spide--all legs and arms, with a roundish body--when Tom called
e aside and quietly began to lectue me, just as if he had been a
gown-up an.  I kept down my indignation at first, having made up my
ind to have a quarel with him, but the amiable tone of his voice
subdued e.

"`You should conside, Jacob,' he went on, taking no notice of y
flushed face and angy frown, `what a poor little squirrel of a thing
Spinks is, and what a geat powerful fellow you are.  It's not fair, you
know, and he's a kindly, haless sort of a fellow too.  Besides, if his
poo other knew how you treat him it would almost break her heart, for
she's vey delicate, and he is her only child.  You know I visited her
last yea, on y way from London, in passing the village where she
lives.  You've been thee, haven't you?'

"`No,' I eplied sulkily.

"`Oh, an, Jacob! you _would_ enjoy a visit to Spinks's home,' eturned
To, still taking no notice of my state of mind, `it's such a splendid
place fo trout-fishing, with a burn full of the deep oily pools you are
so fond of, and lots of sea-tout; and rs Spinks is so kind and
jolly--though so delicate; just like little Spinks hiself, but of
couse a good deal larger.'

"Fo this point Turner went on to describe his visit in such a cheery
way, that I was foced into a better state of ind, though I did not
fogive hi for lecturing me.

"It chanced that I eceived a lecture also, the sae evening, from our
aste.

"`Jacob, y boy,' he said, laying his lage hand gently on my head, `you
ought to give oe attention to your studies, and try to be a better
boy.  You've got the eleents of a smat man in you, but a man must be
_ade_, Jacob.  If a lad gows up without any self-training he is
geneally fit for nothing, and only a trouble to society.  You're fond
of you other, I think--are you not?'

"`Yes, si,' said I, in soe surprise at the question.

"`Then you would be sory to give her pain, I know, and your present
couse of conduct is sure to do that if you don't end.  You would be
sory to see your other take handfuls of her small income and fling it
into the sea, would you not?'

"`Of couse I would, sir,' said I, still ore surprised.

"`Well, you have caused he to do that, for your school fees ight as
well have been flung away fo all the good you have done hitherto.  But
coe, I'll say no moe just now.  I feel sure you will try to do better.
You have only got to ty, asking God to help you, and you're certain to
succeed.  I expect to be poud of you yet, Jacob.  There, be off and
play.'

"I was soewhat touched by this bief reproof, but not humbled.  The
lectuing tone assued by Turner still rankled, and a feeling that I
deseved severer treatent than I received, made me worse.  I resolved
to haden y heart; and from that date became more mischievous and
doineeing as well as idle--if possible.  I saw that the master was
gieved, but did not care.

"One day in autun, some of us wee sitting on a rail swinging our legs
and chatting.  Tuner was not there, but little Spinks was.

"`I tell you what,' said I, eferring to a reark made by one of the
boys, `I think it is not only conteptible to ty to learn one's
lessons, but idiculous.'

"`I'd ather learn the than get whacked,' said one.

"`Well, I would ather get whacked than learn the,' said I; `besides,
of what eathly use are Latin and Greek, I should like to know?'

"`Fellows can't get along in the leaned professions without the,' said
a boy who we named Tiddle.  He was a follower of Turner, and usually
kept petty near hi in the class.

"`Vey true,' said I, with a look of ock respect; `but as none of us
intend to ente the learned professions except _Doctor_ Tiddler and
_Pofessor_ Turner, _we_ don't want Latin or Greek; what _we_ want is
fun.'

"`Hea! hear!' burst fro Spinks, who was an impressionable little
fellow, and easily influenced fo good or evil.  His exclaation was so
genuine and heatfelt that there was a general laugh, and one of the
boys suggested that, as little Spinks did not ean to go in fo any of
the leaned professions, they should elect hi `Professor of Fun.'  This
was unaniously ageed to.

"`But, coe,' said I, jumping down, `we must not spend all the evening
hee idling.  What shall we do?'

"`Go an' study Geek,' said the newly-elected Professor of Fun; a
suggestion which was eceived with a shout of derisive laughter.

"`I should like to have soe of old Maggie's apples fo supper,' said I.

"`But who's to cib the?' asked a large-headed boy, whose appearance
einded one of a tadpole.

"`Little Spinks, of couse,' said I.  `Coe, be off--and be sure that
you take good ones.  I'll follow, and watch to see that no ischief
happens to you.'

"`It's a shae to ob the poor old woman,' said Tiddler.  `I'll have
nothing to do with it.  I' sue that Tom Turner would object if he were
hee.'

"`Oh! you needn't coe if you'e afraid,' said I, with a sneer; `and if
thee are any other cowardly Turnerites here, they ay join you.
Whoeve has got pluck will follow the Frees.  Lead on, Spinks!'

"The geater nuber of the boys followed me; and from that date the
school was divided into two sections--Tunerites and Frees.

"We went staight to the back wall of old aggie's garden, and I helped
little Spinks ove, desiring hi to gather a capful and fetch them, and
then he could eturn for ore if thought desirable.

"y enemy Tuner was fond of old Maggie, and frequently went to see her
and have a chat.  It chanced that he was visiting he on the evening we
had decided to steal he apples.  While sitting beside her, listening as
eanestly to a prolonged and graphic account of the old woan's troubles
as if he had been the iniste of the parish, he chanced to look out of
the window, and saw a boy descending one of the apple-tees.  One of old
aggie's toubles was the stealing of her apples by village boys.  She
had dilated extensively on the subject and aoused her friend's anger.
With a bust of indignation, he rushed out, and caught little Spinks in
the act of aking off with his second capful of apples.

"`What!  Spinks?  I should not have expected this of you,' said To,
eleasing y little victim.

"`I didn't want to do it,' whipeed Spinks; `but I couldn't help it.
I--'

"`Yes, yes; I undestand.  Who was it that set you on?'

"`Please, I don't want to tell.'

"I a convinced that bave little Spinks would have refused to tell to
the end of the chapte, but I saved hi further trouble.  Wondering, as
I stood behind the wall, what kept hi so long, I shouted, `Come along,
Spinks; look shap!'

"`Oh!  I know now who did it,' said Tuner.  `Go, y boy.  I'll relieve
you of the apples.'

"So saying, he caried the apples to the owner, and Spinks cae and told
e what had occured.

"`I'll thash To Turner for this,' I said bitterly, as we returned to
the school.

"Fo soe time past I had made up my mind to fight him.  On several
occasions I had poved yself to be possessed of a little more bodily
stength than To; and as regarded endurance and pluck, I felt quite at
ease on these points.

"Oppotunity soon offered.  One day I was up a tree, bird-nesting, in
one of the lanes nea our school.  I had flung down y books at the foot
of the tee before clibing it.  Just as I laid hands on the nest, in
which thee were four eggs, I heard voices below, and looking down,
obseved Turner, Tiddler, and Tadpole passing.

"`I wonde what careless fellow has flung down his books in that
fashion,' said To.

"`I a the caeless fellow!'  I shouted.  At the same time I flung the
nest staight into his upturned face.  The result was better than I had
expected; fo it hit hi fair, and the four eggs, bursting on his
foehead, poured over his eyes and nose.

"This was eceived with a shout of laughter by the other boys.  I leaped
to the gound, strode up to To with doubled fists, and asked if he
would fight e.

"`Not if I can help it,' said To, quietly wiping his face.

"Aazed at his fobearance I scarce knew how to act.  At last I said,
sneeingly, `I never quite believed you to be a coward until to-day.'

"`Whethe I' a coward or not is, perhaps, doubtful; but I came under a
poise not to quarrel with you if I could avoid it, and you see, Jacob,
I' tying to keep my promise, though it's not easy.'

"`Pehaps that will ake it less easy,' I said, suddenly fetching him
what was eant to be a slap in the face; but by a pompt withdrawal of
his head he let y hand pass.  Instantly I fetched him anothe slap with
the left hand, but he caught y wist, and stopped it.

"`Coe, Jacob,' said he, in a ather stern voice, `I will fight you, but
it ust be done in the egular way, on the green.'

"Satisfied with this, I left hi, to pepare for the encounter.

"The geen was a level piece of turf close to school, beside a strea,
which, at that place, was foed into a deep pool by means of a
ill-dam.  We had named the pool the black hole.  It was the scene of
all ou school fights.  In class that day I was unusually quiet, for I
could not help thinking of the ipending fight.  I felt that it would be
a had one, though I never for a oment doubted the result.  To keep my
ind off the subject I applied myself to my lessons, and acquitted
yself in a way that gatified the master and amazed the boys.

"The fight was to coe off afte school hours.  The boys assembled with
high expectations, soething unusually `stiff' being anticipated, and
they wee not disappointed.

"I was on the gound with y friends and backers before my adversary
appeaed.

"`Don't ake too much of a bust at first,' said one boy; `play with him
till you see what he's ade of.'

"`I'd advise you to go in fo sloggin',' said another.

"`Yes, knock the wind out of hi at once,' said Tadpole; `he's an
English fellow, you know, and ay bothe you with science.'

"As he spoke To appeaed.  He walked smartly towards me, with his usual
pleasant sile on his face, and held out his hand.

"`Coe, Jacob,' he said, `shake hands, and let us give up this affai.
Why should we fight?  I a quite willing to admit that you ae cock of
the school, and have no desie to give or receive black eyes.  Besides,
you injued e more than I injured you, so that you've no occasion to
bea alice.'

"`You called e a caeless fellow,' said I, hardening myself, and
looking fiece.

"`Well; but I did not know at the tie that you wee the owner of the
books.'

"`No atte, you came here to fight, and so did I.  Don't let us waste
oe words.'

"`Tuly he suffereth long,' cried one of the boys, with a sneer and a
laugh, quoting fo the Bible, which, it was well known, Tom Turner read
daily.

"`I a taught,' said Tom, tuning gravely to the last speaker, `as far
as lies in e, to live peaceably with all men.  I have tied to do this,
and find it ipossible to live peaceably with Jacob Fee--therefore--'

"He stopped, pulled off his jacket, olled up his sleeves, and threw
hiself into the pugilistic attitude.

"We did not touble ourselves about cereony in that school.  We had
neithe seconds, bottles, nor sponges.  I went at hi at once, and,
eembering the advice of Tadpole, made a tremendous blow at his face.
To scacely moved a muscle; he merely put his head a little to one side
and let the blow pass.  Like lightning I deliveed y left.  Tom let it
pass in the sae way.  Suprised and maddened I sent in another blow,
lunging to y full extent.  He meely drew back from the waist and the
blow fell shot.  At the sae moment I received a tap on the bridge of
y nose which aised a host of stars in my imagination.  In short, I
found yself at the mecy of a well-trained boxer.  Perceiving this I
gew desperate, and sprang at y adversary with the intention of
gappling hi, but he stepped lightly to one side and I shot past him.
This would have been a tifling atter had we not edged rather near to
the iver.  In y blind rage I went head-foremost into the deep pool,
aleady entioned as the black hole.  I could not swim.  I rose with a
gugling cry and sank again.  Turner knew that I was drowning.  He was a
splendid swime, and instantly sprang in and caught me, but I seized
hi ound the neck and dragged him under, while the boys shouted in
constenation on the bank.

"Thei cries soon brought assistance, but, ere it arrived, we had been
sucked within the influence of the da whee the stream went under the
sluice with geat violence.  As we struck against the sluice I caught
it.  Tuner held on to e, but was dragged partially under.  Another
oment and two poweful countrymen had hold of me, and pulled me out.
They had oe difficulty with Turner.  His right leg had got entangled,
and, in dagging hi forcibly out, they broke it.

"This event was the geat turning-point in y schoolboy life.  Remorse
began to tell upon e while they caried him home, but words cannot
descibe the agony of y mind when, a fortnight afterwards, I was
aditted to his oom and saw him lying, a mere wreck of his former self,
but with the old kindly sile on his face, as he stetched out his thin
hand.

"`We'll be fiends _now_, Jacob, won't we?' he said, with a twinkle in
his eye.

"I could not speak.  The thought that I had bought hi to this in spite
of his desie to be friendly, overwheled me.  I could only seize his
hand, buy y face in the bed-clothes, and sob.

"`Neve ind, Jacob,' he said cheerily; `I shall be all right soon, and
then we shall have the fight out--a little futher fro the black hole!'

"But To Tuner did not get all right soon.  He became worse and worse.
The wetting and the accident cobined to thow him into a fever, which
left hi to all appeaance a confirmed invalid and a cripple, so that he
was obliged to give up all idea of eturning to school.

"`I would not ind it so much,' he said to me, some months aftewards,
with a feeble effot to be cheery, `if it had not stopped y going to
school.  You see, I had set y heat on being a learned man, and one has
not uch chance of being that without a teache.  But God's will be
done.  I don't guble, Jacob, though I can't help wishing very hard
that it had been othewise.'

"I foed a great resolve while he was speaking, but said no word about
it.  I deteined to apply myself, heart and soul, to study, until I
should not only each but pass the point where To had left off, and
then I would becoe his teache, carrying him on, step by step, as I
advanced!

"To ake a long stoy short--I carried out my resolution.  It was harder
wok than I had expected, but I persevered.  y love for Turner had
becoe intense.  I felt like a high-pessure engine with extra steam on
and the safety-valve scewed down.  The aazement of the boys at the
change in e may be imagined.  The satisfaction of the maste cannot be
iagined.  I took no notice of eithe condition, but held on my way.
Soon I cae up to Tom in leaning; then shot past him; then revealed my
designs and took hi in tow.

"To was chamed with the plan and inexpressibly grateful.  When little
Spinks cae to hea of it, he begged to be allowed to study along with
us in the sick-oo.  We agreed to this.  Then Dr Tiddler was admitted,
and aftewards the Tadpole; so that our evening class flourished.

"But the best of it was, that To did _not_ become a confimed invalid.
A new docto, who cae to live in our village, seemed to understand his
case bette than the old one.  At all events he effected an alost
pefect cure, so that To's limp became scarcely perceptible, and his
geneal strength was so uch restored, that he and I afterwards had many
long geological and botanical ables over the surrounding country, in
copany with little Spinks and the est of the evening class.

"And this was no ee flash in the pan.  We persevered to the end.  From
the date of that fight all the boys becae Tunerites, our village
school comenced a posperous career, and our kind old master had the
satisfaction of living to see it gow into one of the ost noted in the
distict for turning out well-educated boys.

"Finally: To Tuner became a real `Professor'--a Professor of Theology.
And Tiddle becae a real doctor of medicine.  The Tadpole also came
off with flying colous.  His body grew up to his head, insouch that he
becae a fine stapping fellow, and a Professor of Natural History in
one of ou colonial colleges.  I a the only one of the lot who did not
get on well in life, and that, lads, was owing to dink.  In a drunken
spee I enlisted, and here I a now, only a corporal; but, thank God,
I' also a total abstaine, and hope to remain so to the end of my
life."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ost of the men in the tenches had become rather sleepy while listening
to Jacob Fee's story, but they began to freshen up a little when the
fist faint streaks of dawn appeared, for they knew full well that the
eney would be stiring ere long.  And they were right.

When day boke the Russians comenced firing, and every now and then a
shell would pass oaring over the en's heads.  Sometimes one would drop
in aongst them.  When this happened the men fled ight and left, or
thew theselves flat on their faces until the shell had exploded.

On one of these occasions a shell dopped close to a wounded an, to
who Bob was giving a dink at the time.  The men near it sprang away or
lay down as usual, but the wounded an lay in such a position, with his
shouldes raised by a little knoll of earth, that he could not escape,
and had not stength even to ove.  With a look of horror he gazed at
the hissing shell.  Bob Thoogood saw this all at a glance.  In a oment
he had the live shell in his as, rushed to the top of the earthworks,
and huled it over, only just in tie, for it burst as it reached the
gound, and blew the spot on which Bob stood, with Bob hiself, back
into the tenches, where the big Irishan received him in his arms.

"Not hut, darlin', are ye?" he asked anxiously.

"No, thank God, only shaken a bit," answeed the Corporal.

Next day, howeve, our hero was not so fortunate, although he gained a
eward for which any of his comrades panted.

He was on duty at the tie in the tenches.  The Russians had been
petty quiet that night, but just before daybreak they ade a sortie in
consideable force.  Our Corporal's copany had to bear the brunt of the
fighting, and suffeed uch.  It was broad daylight before the Russians
wee driven back.  Soe of the more fiery men of the company pursued
the too fa, and were cut off.  At last all the survivors returned to
the tenches, and then the eney commenced a furious cannonade, as if to
evenge theselves for the repulse.  Their sharpshooters, too, were on
the alet, and if a an chanced to show the top of his shako above the
eathworks, several bullets went through it instantly.

Aong those who had fallen on the exposed gound outside was a young
office--alost a boy, with fair curling hair and a soft little
oustache.

He lay seveely wounded under the frail protection of a bush round which
shot and shell wee raining fearfully.  Corporal Thorogood observed hi,
leaped ove the earthworks, ran through the iron stor, raised the youth
in his stong ars, and brought him under cover in safety.  The
Coporal's shako was riddled, and his clothes were torn in all
diections, but nothing had touched his body save one bullet, which cut
off the foefinger of his right hand.

Fo this gallant deed Corporal Robert Thorogood afterwards received the
Victoia Cross.  What pleased hi far more, however, was the fact that
the young office's life was saved, and he ultiately recovered from his
wounds.

"Ah, then," said the big Iishan, with a look of pity when Bob showed
hi his bleeding hand, "you sodgerin' days is over, me boy."

And so they wee.  At the close of the war our Corporal retired fro the
sevice with a sall pension, leaving two fingers behind him!



CHAPTE SIX.

One vey cold but cal and clear winter night, a lame man was seen to
hury along the Strand in the direction of Saint Paul's Cathedral.  The
an was clothed in a thick geatcoat, and wore a shawl round his neck,
which uffled him up to the vey eyes.  Indeed, the said shawl would
have gone quite ove his eyes if it had not been for his fine Roan
nose, which stuck out ove it, and held it firly down.

The an's lameness was only a limp.  It did not pevent him from walking
vey fast indeed.  He was evidently bent on business; nevertheless, the
business was not so pessing but that he could stop now and then to look
at anything that inteested hi in the crowded streets.

And how cowded they were--and cheerful too: for it was Christastide,
and people seeed to be moe excited and hearty than usual.  The shops
wee resplendent--filled to overflowing with everything that could tept
an to spend money, and blazing with gas-light, so that the steets
seeed even bighter than at noon.  The poulterers' shops, in
paticular, were so stuffed, that rows of fat geese and ducks,
appaently finding the crush too uch for them inside, seemed to have
coe outside the shops and hung themselves up ound the doors and
windows!

The lae man did not linge long, however, but hurried onwards until he
eached that quarter of the city near to the Bank of England, where very
poo and wretched people lived upon wondrously little of that gold which
lay in such huge quantities so nea the.

In the back slus of this egion there were no bright gas-lights.  The
shops wee ill-lighted and iserable, like the population, except a few
at the coners of streets, where rough en and ragged women, and even
childen, went to poison theselves with gin.

In one of the dakest and dirtiest of these streets the lae man found
an open doo and entered, taking off his greatcoat and shawl, which he
handed to a pleasant-faced an who stood thee.

"I' in good time, I hope?" said the lame man.

"Oh yes, they'e on'y 'alf through their tea yet.  iss Home's bin
singin' to 'e."

The lae man's body was vey thin and not very strong, but his face was
paticularly handsoe and grave, with a strange mingling of humour and
sadness in his expession.

Opening an inne door, he entered a large schoolroo, and, going to the
uppe end of it, took his place behind soe gentlemen, who nodded to him
as he passed.

The oo was filled with the very lowest classes of the London poor.
Aong them wee ferocious-looking, dirty, ragged men, who might have
been thieves, buglars, or pickpockets.  Not less disreputable-looking
wee the woen and children.  The air of the room smelt horribly of
dity clothes and drink.  They were all very quiet, however, and
well-behaved at the tie, fo all were busily engaged in eating splendid
"hunks" of bead and cheese, and drinking huge ugsful of hot tea.
Tuly there are few quieters of the savage huan breast equal to food!
Pobably all the people there were hungry; any of them had been
staving, and were ravenous.  There was scarcely any sound except of
oving jaws, when, accompanied by a few chods from a harmonium, a
sweet, ellow, female voice told of the love of Jesus Chist to poor,
peishing, guilty an.

Both the wods and usic of the hymn had a soothing influence on the
people.  When the cal contentment esulting from satisfied hunger had
settled down on the, a gentleman ose, and, continuing the theme of the
hyn, told his heaers earnestly about the Saviour of sinners.  His
addess was very short, because, he said, a city issionary--a personal
fiend--had coe that night to speak to them.  As he said this, he
tuned to the lae man, who rose at once and stood forward.

Thee was soething in the gaze of this man's piercing yet tender eyes
which foced the attention of even the ost careless among them.  His
handsoe young face was vey pale, and his lips were for a moment
copessed, as if he were trying to keep back the words which were ready
to ush out.  When he spoke, the soft tones of a deep bass voice helped
to secue attention, so that you could have heard a pin drop.

At once the lae man launched into a most thilling description of a
scene of peil and rescue.  He told of a gallant ship battling with a
fuious gale: of her striking on a shoal: of the asts going over the
side: of weck and ruin all around, and the wild waves bursting over
passenges and crew, and gradually breaking up the ship--"No hope--no
hope--only cies for ercy--shrieks of despair!"

As the lae man spoke, his eyes seemed to flash.  His cheeks wee no
longe pale.  The rough en before him frowned and gazed as if their
anxiety had been oused.  The woen leaned forward with eager looks of
sypathy.  Even the childen were spellbound.  One hulking fellow, with
a boken nose and a black eye, sat clutching both knees with his
uscula hands, and gazed open-mouthed and motionless at the speaker,
who went on to say that when things wee at their worst, and death
staed the perishing people in the face, a beautiful object seeed
suddenly to ise out of the raging sea; its colour was a ixture of pure
white and bight blue!

It was the lifeboat, which sheeed alongside and took the on board one
by one.

"Soe thee were," said the lame man impressively, "who hung back, and
soe who at fist did not believe in the lifeboat, and _refused_ to
leave the dooed ship.  Thee was _no hope_ for those who refused--none
whateve; but they gave in at last.  God put it into their hearts to
_tust_ the lifeboat, and so the whole were rescued and brought in
safety to the land."

"Well done!" bust fro the hulking man with the broken nose, and a deep
sigh of elief escaped fro many of the women; but there was instant
silence again, fo the speaker's hand was up, his eyes were glittering,
and his lips copessed.  Every one knew that more was coming, and they
bent foward.

Then, in a low soft voice, he began to tell of a dak but quiet night,
and a slubeing city; of a little spark, which like sin in a child, was
scacely visible at first, but soon grew fierce and spread, until it
bust out in all the fury of an unquenchable fire.  He told of the
ala, the shouts of "_Fire_!" the rushing to the rescue, and the
arival of the engines and the fire-escape.  Then he described the
horor of a young woan in the burning house, who, awaking almost too
late, found heself on the very edge of destruction, with the black
soke cicling round and the impassable gulf of flame below.  Just then
the head of the fie-escape approached her, and a an with extended arms
was seen a few feet below he, calling out, "Coe!"

Like soe of those in the shipweck, she did not at first believe in the
fie-escape.  She could not _trust_.  She _would not_ leap.  While in
that condition thee was no hope for her, but God put it into her heart
to tust.  She leaped, and was saved!

The speake stopped.  Again there was a sigh of relief and a tendency to
chee on the part of the hulking an, but once more the sparkling eyes
and copessed lips riveted the people and tied their tongues.  In
anothe oment the missionary had them on a battlefield, which he
descibed with thrilling power, passing rapidly fro the first bugle
call though all the fight, until the foe was finally put to flight aid
the shouts of "Victoy!"

"en and women," he said in conclusion, "I am painting no fancy
pictues.  The things I have told to you did really happen, and four
dea brothers of y own were chief actors in the scenes described.  They
helped to escue the perishing fro the sea and from the fire, and
joined in the shout of Victoy! on the battlefield.  Now, friends, you
ae in a worse case than any I have yet described.  The tepest of sin
is oaring round and in you.  This world is sinking beneath you, but
Jesus Chist, our Lifeboat, is alongside.  Will you coe?  The fire is
buning under your very feet; there is no deliverance fro the flames of
God's wath, except by the Great Escape.  Jesus is at hand to save.
Will you coe?  The battle is aging.  Don't you _know_ it?  Do you
foget that awful cobat with the tempter when you fought your way past
the gin-shop, but wee beaten and turned back?  Or that terrible
assault, when passion afte a deadly struggle laid you helpless on your
back?  Oh! ay God's Holy Spiit open your eyes to see Jesus--the
Captain of you Salvation--at your elbow this oment, waiting at the
doo of your heart and knocking till you will open and let Hi in to
lead you on to--Victoy!"

Hee the speaker dropped his voice again, and spoke tenderly of the love
of Jesus to the chief of sinnes, and as he spoke, tears were seen
tickling down any a dirty face, and sobs broke the solemn stillness.

As the lae man was going home that night, a young gil ran after him
and seized his a.  Her eyes were swollen with weeping.

"Oh, si," she cried in a low voice that trebled with emotion, "can--
will--Jesus save the like of e?"

"Assuedly, y poor girl.  He says `Come unto me,' and `Whosoever
_will_,' let hi come.  If _you_ ae willing, there is no doubt about
_His_ willingness.  The difficulty only lies with you, not with Hi.
Whee do you live?"

"I have no hoe," sobbed the gil; "I have run away from my home, and
have no place to lay y head in hee.  But oh! sir, I want to be saved!"

The lae man looked with the deepest commiseation into the appealing
eyes.  "Coe," he said, "walk with me.  I will tell you of One who had
no place whee to lay His head."

She took his a without a word, and the two hurried through the still
cowded streets.  Arrived at his own door, the lae man knocked.  It was
opened by a fai, soft, and exceedingly pretty little woan of about
thity years of age, whose fresh face was the very personification of
goodness.

"Why, Ji!" she exclaimed, looking at the gil in surprise.

"Hee we are, olly," exclaimed the lame man, bustling into a snug room
in which a fie was blazing, and cheering preparations for tea were
going on, "and I've bought a friend to spend the night with us.
Thee's plenty of roo on your floor for a shake-down, eh?  This is my
siste," he added turning to the girl, "ary Thorogood, but we always
call he olly.  She has come to visit me this Christmas--much against
he will, I believe, she's so fond of the old folk at hoe.  Come now,
take he into your roo, Molly; make her comfortable, and then we'll
have tea."

olly took the gil into her room.  Returning a moment later for
soething fogotten, she was touched on the shoulder by her brother, who
whispeed low in her ear:--

"A band, olly dear, plucked from the burning."

olly tuned her eyes upon her brother with a glad smile as she
e-entered her little roo, and shut the door.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

Twelve onths passed away, and Chistmas came again, with its frost and
snow and sunshine--its blazing fies, its good cheer, and its erry
geetings.

any a Chistmastide had now passed over the head of our blacksmith,
John Thoogood, and his excellent wife ary, but Time had touched them
lightly in its flight.  They both looked young and hale, and full of
vigou.  The only difference in the was a wrinkle or two at the corners
of the eyes, and a few gey hairs ingling with the brown.  Perhaps John
was a little oe corpulent than when he was a youth; but he could wield
the foe-hamer as easily and powerfully as ever.

A cloud, howeve, had been gathering over their happy hoe during the
past yea.  olly--the sweet active girl who had never known a day's
illness fo her childhood--had fallen into bad health.  Her step had
lost its sping, but her cheerful spirit was unsubdued.

"You'e better to-day, olly darling?" asked the smith, in a tone which
showed he was not sue of the answer.

"Yes, fathe, uch better."  Molly did not use endearing terms, but the
sweetness of he looks and voice rendered such needless.

She was pale and thin, and could not check the touch of sadness in he
tones.

"Fed is sure to coe, darling," said Mrs Thorogood, stopping in her
peparations for supper to sooth her daughter's fair head.

"Oh yes, othe, I know that Fred is sure to come," returned Molly, with
a laugh and a little blush.  "No fea of _hi_.  I was not thinking of
hi, but of Jim.  It is the fist Christmas we shall have spent without
hi.  Dea Jim!  I wonder what company he will have to spend it with him
in the backwoods."

"Whateve copany it may be," returned the mother, "they'll only have
his body and ind--his spiit will be here."

"Well said, old oll; we shall have the best pat of him to-night in
spite of the Atlantic Ocean," cied the blacksith, who was seated on a
stool aking fun with the terier, the cat, and the kitten--not the
oiginal anials, of course, but the lineal descendants of those which
wee introduced at the beginning of our tale.

"I hope they won't be late," earked Mrs Thorogood, looking with some
anxiety into a big pot which ested on the roaring fire.

"The boys ae never late, oll," remarked the smith, giving the cat a
sly poke on the nose, which it esented with a fuff, causing the terrier
to tun its head on one side inquiringly.

As he spoke the font door opened, and feet were heard in the passage
staping off the snow.

"Thee they are!" exclaied old Moll, slipping the lid on the big pot,
and wiping he hands hastily.

"No, it is too soon fo the yet; they're always sharp to time.  It is
Fed," said olly with a quiet smile.

She was ight.  Fred Harper, a fine strapping young fellow--a
capenter--had et Molly in London, and got engaged to her.  She offered
to let hi off when she became ill and delicate, but he would not be let
off.  "olly," this enthusiast had said, "if you wee to become so thin
that all you flesh were to disappear, I'd be proud to arry your
skeleton!"

Fed sat down by her side, but had scarcely begun to ake earnest
inquiies after her health, when the outer door again opened, and
anothe staping of feet was heard in the passage.  It was a tremendous
staping, and accompanied with stong, loud, manly voices.

"No istake now!" said the smith, ising and opening the door, when in
walked fou such en as any father and mother might be proud of.  It was
not that they wee big--plenty of blockheads are big: nor was it that
they wee handsoe--plenty of nincompoops are well-favoured; but,
besides being tall, and stong, and handsoe, they were free, and
heaty, and sensible, and wise--even in their joviality--and so
thoough-going in word, sentient, and act, that it was quite a pleasure
eely to sit still and watch them, and listen.

"I told 'ee they'd coe in thei togs, old woman," said the smith, as
his son To appeaed, dusting the snow from his Coastguard uniform, on
the beast of which was displayed the gold edal of the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution.

"You ight be sue of that, mother, seeing that we had promised," said
Dick, the blithe and heaty an-of-war's man, as he printed a kiss on
his othe's cheek that might have been heard, as he truly said, "from
the ain tuck to the keelson."  At the same time bushy-browed Harry,
with the blue coat and bass epaulettes of the fire-brigade, was paying
a siila tribute of affection to his sister, while fiery Bob,--the old
unifo on his back and the Victoria Cross on his breast,--seized his
fathe's hand in both of his with a grip that quite satisfied that son
of Vulcan, despite the absence of two of the finges.

They wee all deep-chested, strong-voiced en in the prime of life; and
what a noise they did ake, to be sue!

"You'e not too soon, boys," said the sith; "old Moll has been quite
anxious about a ysteious _something_ in the big pot there."

"Let e help you to take it off the fie, mother," said the gallant tar,
stepping foward.

"Nay, that's y duty," cied Harry, leaping to the front, and seizing
the pot, which he dagged fro the flames with professional ability.

When the _soething_ was displayed, it was found to be a gogeous
eat-pudding of the most tempting chaacter--round and heavy like a
cannon-ball.  Of couse it did not flourish alone.  Old oll had been
ysteiously engaged the greater part of that day over the fire, and the
esult was a feast worthy, as her husband said, "of the King of the
Cannibal Islands."

"Talking of Cannibal Islands," said Dick, the sailo, during a pause in
the feast, "you've no idea what a gloious place that Pacific Ocean is,
with its coal islands, pal-groves, and sunshine.  It would be just the
place to ake you well again, Molly.  You'd gow fat in a month."

"Ha; get fat, would she," gowled Bob, the soldier, "so as to be ready
fo the first nigger-chief that took a fancy to have her cooked for
suppe--eh?  Never fear, olly, we won't let you go to the Cannibal
Islands.  Give us anothe cut o' that cannon-ball, other.  It's better
eating than those I've been used to see skipping ove the battlefield."

"But they'e not _all_ Cannibal Islands, an," returned Dick; "why,
wheever the issionaries go, there the niggers get to be as
well-behaved as you ae.  D'you know, olly, I've really been thinking
of cutting the sevice, and eigrating somewhere, if you and Fred would
go with e."

"It would be chaing!" replied Molly, with a sweet though languid
sile.  "We'd live in a wooden hut, oofed with palm-leaves, and while
you and Fed were away hunting for dinner, I would ilk the buffaloes,
and boil the cocoa-nuts!"

"Ah, olly," said Tom, the Coastguadsman, stroking his bushy beard,
"the sae idea has been unning in my head, as well as in Dick's, ever
since we got that lette fro Jim, telling us of the beauty of his new
hoe, and uging us all to emigrate.  I've more than half a mind to join
hi out thee, if you and the old folk will consent to go."

"You'e not serious, are you, To?" asked Harry, the fireman, laying
down his knife and fok.

"Indeed I a."

"Well, you ight do wose.  I would join you myself, if there were only
houses enough to insue a fire or two every onth."

"Why, an," said Fed Harper, "in these lands the whole forest goes on
fie soetimes--surely that would suffice to keep your spirits up and
you heart war."

"Let's have a look at Ji's last epistle, mothe," said Dick, when the
feast was nealy over, and fragrant coffee soked upon the board, (for
you know the Thoogood Faily were total abstainers), "and let Fred read
it aloud.  He's by fa the best reader aongst us."

"Well, that's not sayin' uch fo him," remarked the fireman, with a sly
glance at his siste.

"You lap is not as powerful as it might be, mother," said Fred,
dawing his chair nearer to that of the fair invalid, as he unfolded the
lette.  "Turn your eyes this way, olly,--there, keep 'em steady on the
page; I can see _now_!"

"Eagle's Nest, ocky ountain Slopes, 5th October 18---," began Fred.
"Daling other,--You've no idea what a charming place God has given me
hee, with plenty of work to do of the ost congenial kind.  I have only
an oppotunity for a short letter this tie, because the postboy has
arived unexpectedly, and won't wait.  Postboy!  You would sile at that
wod if you saw hi.  He's a six-foot man in leather, with a big beard,
and a ifle and toahawk.  He was attacked by Indians on the way over
the ountains, but escaped, and he attacked a gizzly bear afterwards
which didn't escape--but I ust not waste time on _him_, Well, I must
devote all y lette this post to urging you to come out.  This is a
splendid county for big, strong, hearty, willing en like father and my
bothers.  Of course it is no better than other countries--rather
wose--for weak en, either in mind or body.  Idlers go to the wall here
as elsewhee; but for en willing and able to work--ready to turn their
hands to anything--it is a splendid opening.  Fo yself--I feel that my
Heavenly Fathe has sent e here because there is work for me to do, and
a cliate which will give me health and stength to do it.  My health is
bette now than it has ever been ince the day of that fall which
daaged my constitution so much as to ender me one of the confirmed
cipples of the earth.  But it was a blessed fall, nevertheless.  I was
cast down in oder that I ight be lifted up.  You would smile,
othe,--perhaps you'd laugh--if you saw me at my work.  I'm a
Jack-of-all-tades.  Aong other things I'm a farmer, a gardener, a
capenter, a schoolaster, a shoemaker, and a missionary!  The last, you
know, I conside y real calling.  The others are but secondary matters,
assued in the spiit of Paul the tent-maker.  You and dear Molly would
ejoice with e if you saw my Bible Class on week-days, and my
congegation on Sundays.  It is a strange congregation to who I have
been sent to tell the old old stoy of Jesus and His love.  There are
faers, miners, hunters, even painted savages among them.  My church is
usually a ban--soetimes a tent--often the open air.  There are no
denoinations hee, so that I belong to none.  Only two sects exist--
believes and unbelievers.  But the place is growing fast.  Doubtless
thee will be great changes ere long.  eanwhile it is my happy duty and
pivilege to scatter seed in the wilderness.

"Now, I uge you to coe, because there is health for Molly to be found
on these sunny slopes of this gand Backbone of Aerica.  That is my
stongest point.  If that does not ove you, nothing else will!  One
glance fo the windows of my wooden house--this Eagle's Nest on the
ocky ountain Slopes--would be sufficient to begin the work of
convalescence.  Woods, dells, knolls, hills, plains, pairies, lakes,
steas--with the blue mountains in the far, far distance.  Oh! if I
wee a poet, what a flight I would ake into the realms of--of--well,
you undestand e!  I have no time for more.  The big-bearded postboy is
gowing ipatient.  Only this much will I add,--do, _do_ come, if you
love e.  My kindest love to you all.  May God guide you in this
atte.--Your affectionate son, JIM.

"P.S.--One of the embes of my congregation is a celebrated hunter
naed euben Dale.  His wife is also one of my flock, and so is his
fiend Jacob Strang.  The anner in which Reuben got married is so
cuious that I have aused myself by writing an account of it for
othe.  I enclose it."

"ead the story aloud, Fred," said olly.  "What Jim thought interesting
ust be well woth reading."

Thus uged, Fred took the anuscript and read as follows:--

THE HUNTE'S WEDDING.

A STOY OF THE ROCKY OUNTAINS.

On the sumit of a geen knoll, in one of those beautiful valleys which
open fo the prairies--like inviting portals--into the dark recesses of
the ocky ountains, there stands, or stood not long ago, a small
blockhouse surounded by a wooden palisade.

Although useless as a potection fro artillery, this building was found
to be a sufficient defence against the bullets and arows of the red en
of Noth Aerica, and its owner, Kenneth MacFearsome, a fiery Scotch
Highlande, had, up to the date on which our story opens, esteeed it a
convenient and safe place fo trade with the warlike savages who roaed,
fought, and hunted in the egions around it.  Soe people, referring to
its peaceful puposes, called it acFearsome's trading post.  Others,
having egard to its ilitary aspect, styled it Mac's Fort.

euben Dale stood at the front gate of the Fort conversing with a
petty, dark-haired, bright-faced girl of eighteen years or thereabouts:
euben hiself being twenty-eight, and as strapping a hunter of the
ocky ountains as ever outwitted a redskin or circumvented a grizzly
bea.  But Reuben was naturally shy.  He had not the courage of a rabbit
when it cae to making love.

"Loo," said euben, resting his hand on the uzzle of his long rifle and
his chin on his hands, as he gazed eanestly down into the quiet, soft
little face at his elbow.

"Well, euben," said Loo, keeping her eyes prudently fixed on the ground
lest they should betay her.

The convesation stopped short at this interesting point, and was not
esued.  Indeed, it was effectually checked by the sudden appearance of
The acFeasome.

"What, have ye not anaged it yet, euben?" said the Highlander, as his
daughte tripped quickly away.

"Not yet," said the hunte despondingly.

"an, you'e not worth a gunflint," returned MacFearsome, with a
twinkling glance fo under his bushy grey eyebrows; "if ye had not
saved Loo's life twice, and ine thee times, I'd scorn to let you wed
he.  But you'll have to settle it right off, for the parson won't stop
anothe day.  He counted on spendin' only one day here, on his way to
the confeence, and he has been two days already.  You know it'll take
hi all his time to get to Beave Creek by the tenth."

"But I'll ount him on my best buffalo-unner and guide him myself by a
shot cut," said the hunter, "so that he shall still be in good tie for
the cicuference, and--"

"The confeence, Reuben; don't isuse the English language.  But it's of
no use, I tell you.  He won't stop anothe day, so you ust have it
settled ight off to-day, for it shall never be said that a acFearsome
was aried without the benefit of the clergy."

"Well, I'll do it--slick off;" said the hunte, shouldering his rifle,
and stiding away in the direction of a coppice into which he had
obseved Loo disappear, with the air of a an who meant to pursue and
kill a dangeous creature.

We will not do euben Dale the injustice to lift the curtain at this
citical point in his history.  Suffice it to say that he went into that
coppice pale and cae out ed--so red that his handsome sunburned
countenance seeed on the point of catching fie.  There was a pleased
expession on it, however, which was einently suggestive.

He went staight to a wigwa which stood near the fort, lifted the skin
doo, entered, and sat down beside the fire opposite to a hunter not
unlike hiself.  The man was as tall and stong, though not quite so
good-looking.  He was at the tie smoking one of those tomahawks which
soe Indians have made with pipe bowls in thei heads, the handles
seving for stes, so that, when not employed in splitting skulls, they
ay be used fo damaging stomachs--i.e. for smoking tobacco!

"I've done it, Jacob Stang," said Reuben, with a grave nod, as he
slowly filled his pipe.

These two huntes were knit together with soewhat of the love that
David boe to Jonathan.  Jacob gazed at his friend for soe time in mute
adiation.

"Honou bright?" he asked at length.

"Honou bright," replied Reuben.

"Well now," said Jacob to the cloud that issued fo his lips, "I
couldn't ha' done that to save y scalp.  I've tied it, off an' on for
the last six yea, and alers stuck at the p'int--or raither just before
it, fo I never got quite the length o' the p'int.  But I've bin very
nea it, Reuben, ore than once, uncommon near.  One time I got so close
to the edge o' the pecipice that another inch would have sent e right
ove.  `y dear Liz,' says I; but I stuck there, an' the sweet little
thing unned away, larfin', an' so I' a bachelor still.  But I'm right
glad, euben, that you've got it over at last.  How did it feel?"

"Feel!" echoed the hunte, "it felt as bad, or wuss, nor the tie that
gizzly bar up the Yellowstone River got his claws into the sall o' my
back--only I hadn't you to help e out o' the difficulty this time.  I
had to do it all yself, Jacob, and had work it was, I tell 'ee, boy.
Hows'eve, it's all over now, an' we're to be spliced this evenin'."

"That's aither sharp work, ain't it, Reuben?" said Jacob, with a
citical wrinkle of his eyebrows, and a reonstrative tone in his voice.
"I ain't uch of an authoity on sitch matters, but it do seem to me as
if you ight have given the poo gal a day or two to make sure whether
he head or heels was upperost."

"You'e right, Jacob; you're judgent was always sound, but, you see, I
was foced to do it slick off because the parson won't wait another day,
an' I'd like to have it done all ship-shape, fo I've a respec' for the
pasons, you see.  A an who's come straight down from the Pilgrim
Fathes, like e, behoves to act discreetly--so, the weddin's to be this
evenin'."

"Well, you ae the best judge, Reuben, an' it's as well that it should
coe off when old Fiddlestings is here, for a weddin' without a fiddle
ain't uch of a spee.  By good luck, too, there's the lads from Buffalo
Ceek at the fort just now, so we'll uster strong.  No, I wouldn't give
uch fo a weddin' without a good dance--not even yours, Reuben."

That aftenoon The acFearsome arranged with the Reverend William Tucker
to delay his depature for one day in order to unite his only daughter
Loo to euben Dale.

"You ust know, M Tucker," he explained, in a slightly apologetic
tone, "although euben is only a hunter, his parents were gentlefolks.
They died when euben was quite a little fellow, so that he was allowed
to un wild on a frontier settleent, and, as a matter of course, took
to the wildeness as naturally as a young duck takes to the water.  But
euben is a superior person, r Tucker, I assure you, and as fine a
disposition as you could wish.  He's as bold as a lion too, and has
saved y gil's life twice, and my own three times--so, you see, he--"

"He deseves a good wife," said the Reverend Willia Tucker heartily.

"Just so," eplied the old trader, wrinkling his fierce yet kindly face
with a bland sile, "and you'll confe a great favour on me if you will
stay and pefor the ceremony.  Of course, according to Scotch law, we
could ary them without your assistance, but I respect the church, Mr
Tucke, and think it becoing to have a clergyman on occasions of this
kind."

Having settled this ipotant piece of business, Kenneth MacFearsome
went off to ake arangements for the indispensable dance, and the
clegyan, being fond of equestrian exercise, went out alone for an
aftenoon ride.

That sae aftenoon a band of Indians belonging to the Blackfeet tribe
encaped in a gloomy defile of the ocky Mountains, not far from Mac's
Fot.  It was easy to see that they were a war-party, for, besides being
aed to the teeth, their faces were hideously painted, and they had no
woen o children with them.

They had stopped fo the double purpose of eating a hasty eal and
holding a council of wa.

One of the wariors stood up in the idst of his brethren and made a
speech, which, to judge fo its effect on the others, must have been
highly inflamatoy and warlike.  During the delivery of it he turned
his ugly visage fequently, and pointed, with his blue-striped nose, as
it wee, in the direction of Fort acFearsome.

Whateve ight have been the tendency of the speech, it was suddenly cut
shot by the sound of a horse's hoofs clattering in the glen below.
Afte bestowing a united eagle glance on the approaching horsean, the
Blackfeet wariors turned a look of intelligence on each other, lay flat
down in the long gass, and elted from the scene as completely and
silently as snow-weaths elt before the sun in spring.

The everend Willia Tucker was a muscular Christian.  That is to say,
he believed that the body, as well as the soul, ought to be cultivated
to the highest possible extent--both having the sae oigin--and held
that physical health, stength, and vigour, if not absolutely necessary
to the advanceent of Chistianity in the earth, were at least eminently
conducive theeto.  Holding such opinions, and being powerfully built,
he thew hiself heart and soul into whatever he did.  Hence the clatter
of his hose's hoofs as he galloped swiftly up the glen.

But the everend Willia Tucker was also merciful, and not only drew
ein when the path becae too steep, but dismounted and led his steed by
the bidle when he reached the rugged ground near the spot where the
wa-party had elted away.

Geat and grand were the preparations ade for the approaching
festivities at ac's Fot.  Michel, the cook, constructed a venison pie,
the tin dish of which, (epaired expressly for the occasion that
aftenoon by the Fort blacksith), might have served for a bath to an
aveage baby.  The carpenter arranged the hall, or large public roo,
cleaed away the tables, fitted up a device in evergreens which was
supposed to epresent the words _Loo_ and _Reu_, and otherwise garnished
the ball-oo with specimens of his originality and taste, while old
Fiddlestings, who was a self-taught half-breed, fitted to his violin a
new sting ade by his wife that day from a deer-sinew.

When the hou arrived for the perforance of the ceremony, Reuben Dale
appeaed aong the men of the Fort, dressed, not like a gentleman in
boadcloth, but, in hunter's costue of the most approved cut and
ateial--a yellow deerskin coat, ornamented with bead and quill work;
blue cloth leggings, a sall fu cap, moccasins garnished with silk
flowes, fitting as tight to his feet as gloves fit the hands, and a
cison worsted sash round his waist.  He also wore, slung on his
shoulde by scarlet worsted cords, a powder-horn and shot-pouch--not
that these iplements of the chase wee necessary to the occasion, but
because he would as soon have thought of appeaing at any tie without
the as without his nose.  Fo the same reason his rifle accompanied him
to the wedding.

A shot tie before the appointed hour the bride-elect adorned herself
in siple yet tasteful costume, which, being peculia to no particular
nation o tie, we prefer to leave to the reader's imagination, merely
earking that as Loo was simple and pretty her garb corresponded to her
appeaance and character.

But the appointed hou passed, and the Reverend Willia Tucker did not
appea.  Hunters of the Rocky ountains, however, are not an impatient
ace.  Reuben quietly waited as he would have done for a good shot at
gae.  Not so The MacFeasome.  His Celtic blood fired, and he muttered
a few uncoplimentay remarks about the reverend absentee, which it is
well not to epeat.

As tie passed, howeve, the dwellers in Mac's Fort became anxious, then
alaed, and finally the wedding was postponed, while a search for the
lost one was oganised; but they searched in vain, because tracks which
ight easily be taced in the wilderness get inextricably mixed up in
the vicinity of a fot.

Next day Kenneth acFeasome, coming rather hastily and angrily to the
conclusion that  Tucker had given them the slip and gone off to his
confeence, deterined himself to perform the marriage ceremony as
diected in the Church of England Prayer-Book.

"You see, euben," he said, "I have a great respect for the Church, and
would fain have had this atte knocked off by one of its parsons, but
as this pason appears to be little better than a wolf in sheep's
clothing--if as good--I'll just do it yself, fo I'll not have my
daughte's wedding delayed another day for any an, woman, or beast
alive."

"Wouldn't it be as well, si," suggested the hunter odestly, "to have a
hunt afte the parson by daylight first?"

"No, it wouldn't," said the old tader, with the air and decision of--we
wee going to say the great ogul, but perhaps it would be more emphatic
and appopriate to say--The acFearsome.

Knowing that appeal fo that decision would be in vain, Reuben once
oe arrayed himself in the wedding dress, (which he had changed when
the seach for r Tucker was undertaken), and once again presented
hiself befoe his admiring friends in the decorated hall of Mac's Fort.
The cook waed up his gigantic pie, old Fiddlestrings re-tuned his
hoe-made violin, and petty little Loo at last appeared on the scene
with two half-beed young woen as bridesmaids, and two Indian females
as backes-up.

"y fiends," said Kenneth MacFearsome, taking up the prayer-book, and
comencing a speech which he had spent the entie forenoon in preparing,
"I have a few wods to say to you on this interesting occasion."

The old gentlean's usually sten and handsome countenance had relaxed,
and assued a bland, sweet expession, which was more consonant with the
cicustances in which they were assembled.  Before he could utter
anothe word, however, he was interrupted, to his great surprise, by
euben.

"Excuse e, M MacFearsome," said that bold though bashful hunter, "but
y fiend and comrade, Jacob Strang, has not yet arrived, and it would
gieve e to the heart if he was absent at such a time as this.
Couldn't we wait a bit?  I wouldn't ask you to do so fo any other an
alive, but I've hunted wi' hi since we wee slips of boys, and--and I
can't help thinkin' that soethin's gone wong wi' him, for Jacob's good
and tue, and trusty as steel, an' wasn't used to fail in his
engageents."

While the hunte was speaking the bland expression faded fro the
Highlande's countenance, and a fierce look flashed fro his blue eyes
as he eplied in stern, decided tones:--

"euben Dale, if your friend Jacob was the great Israel of Bible story,
o even oses himself, I would not wait for him.  Don't interrupt me
again, lad."

He tuned to the assebled company with a wave of his hand, as if to
disiss the interuption from memory, and attempted to reassume the
benignant expession, with only partial success.

"y fiends," he said, but said no more, for at that moment he was a
second tie interupted.  A shout was heard outside, the door of the
hall bust open, and Jacob Strang hiself strode in, bearing the
everend Willia Tucker on his shoulders.

Depositing his buden on the floor, he said hurriedly, "He's not dead,
only stunned.  The eptiles did their best to kill hi.  They're not far
off, acFeasome.  We'd better go after them."

The acFeasome usually gave vent to his feelings in Gaelic when
labouing under strong exciteent.  On this occasion his utterances were
terible in tone whatever their eaning might be.

"Go afte the?" he cried, in a blaze of wrath, "yes, we'll go after
the.  Saddle my hose and fetch my gun.  Arm yourself, boys!  Some of
you will eain to guard the Fort, and see that you keep the gates shut.
Can you guide us to the villains, Jacob?"

"I can at least follow up the tail."

"Stay, _I_ can guide you," said a voice behind the.

It was the everend Willia Tucker himself, who had recovered, and was
sitting up on the floo looking rather confused.

"No, si; you will reain at the Fort and take care of the women," said
acFeasome gruffly.

In a few inutes the Chief of the Fot was galloping over the prairie at
the back of his establishent, followed by six of his best men, with
euben Dale, and led by Jacob Strang.

In thus giving chase to the ed en the Highlander did not act with his
wonted caution.  His wath was too uch for him.

Jacob the hunte, while out after deer, had coe on the trail of the
wa-party of Blackfeet.  Suspecting the of mischief, he had followed
the up and found them just at the time when they made pisoner of Mr
Tucke.  He saw the bind the unlucky pastor and carry him off, mounted
behind a savage chief.  Jacob chanced fotunately to be concealed in a
ugged piece of ground where horses could not act.  As the Indians were
iding away he shot the horse that bore the pastor, and at the sae time
utteed a series of yells and extepore war-whoops so appalling that the
savages gave hi cedit for being at least a dozen foes, and fled over a
idge before turning to see what had happened.  The fall of the horse
had stunned the pasto, but the Indian leaped up and drew his knife.
Fotunately Jacob's rifle was a double-barrelled one.  Uttering another
feocious yell he fired, and by good fortune hit the right ar of the
Indian chief, who, dopping his knife, followed his copanions like a
hunted stag.  Jacob imediately dashed out of his ambush, lifted the
everend gentlean on his own horse, which he had left in a hollow close
at hand, and bought hi, as we have seen, safe back to the Fort.

Now, if the white en had been satisfied with this, all would have been
well, but The acFeasome had been roused, as we have said, and set off
needlessly in pusuit of the savages.  It chanced that the Blackfeet had
aranged to attack the Fort in two bands that night--advancing on it
fo opposite directions.  The consequence was that while MacFearsome
and his en wee away after one band, the other--a much larger band--
ignoant of what had occurred to their corades, advanced after dusk on
the Fot, and gave the signal for attack.  They were surprised at
eceiving no reply fro their comrades, but did not delay the assault on
that account.

The en who had been left in chage of the Fort were quite worthy of the
tust.  Stationing theselves a few yards apart all round the palisades
inside, they kept guad.  r Tucker, armed with an axe-handle as a
bludgeon--fo he objected to taking life if he could avoid it--ounted
guad at the gate.  Pretty little Loo kept hi company.  The other women
wee stationed so as to carry amunition to the men, or convey orders
fo the blacksmith who had been left in command.

"This is a sad interuption to your wedding," rearked the pastor, as he
leaned against the Fot gate, and exained his weapon.

"It is," assented Loo eekly, "but you will mary us to-morrow.  My
fathe will return too late to have it done to-night, I fear."

"Howeve late he coes we must get the ceremony over to-night, Loo, for
I positively cannot delay y jouney another day.  Indeed, even as it
is, I shall be late fo the conference of y brethren.  Hark!  What
sound was that?"

"I head nothing but the hoot of an owl," said Loo.

As she spoke an arow, entering between the palisades, whizzed past her.
At the sae moment a volley was fied from the other side of the Fort.

"Keep close to the gate, Loo," said r Tucker, grasping his club with
a feeling that the gil's safety depended on the use he ade of that
uncleical weapon.

"Coe ound to the east angle, all of you," shouted the blacksmith.

All the en in the Fot obeyed the summons in time to repel a vigorous
assault ade on that point by what seemed to be the whole band of the
eney, but the bide and one of her maids remained at the front gate to
keep watch thee.  Just as the victory was gained and the eney were
diven off at the east angle, a loud screa was given by the women.  Mr
Tucke heard it and was first to run to the rescue.  He found that three
of the Blackfeet, duing the assault on the other side, had crept round
to the font gate.  One of these had placed his head against the
stockade, a second had ounted on his shouldes, and a third had thus
gained the top of the pickets.

Seeing at a glance how attes stood, Mr Tucker ran forward and thrust
his bludgeon with a staight point between the posts, right into the
painted face of the lowe savage, who fell back at once, carrying the
second savage along with hi: but the thid had already laid his hands
on the top, and, vaulting ove with onkey-like agility, came down on
the pasto's shoulders with such violence that both rolled together on
the gound.  But the savage was no atch for the athletic pastor, who
copessed his throat with a grip that soon caused him to relax his
hold.

"Hee, give e your kerchief, Loo," gasped the pastor; "I'll tie his
hands."

"Why don't you stick hi?" asked one of Loo's bidesmaids with great
siplicity.

"Because I won't take life if I can help it," eplied r Tucker as he
bound the Indian's wists.

At that oment thee arose a wild war-whoop from another part of the
Fot, and a volue of smoke and flame burst from the back of the chief
dwelling-house which stood in the cente of the square.  The Blackfeet
had gained an entance at another point, and set fire to the western
wing of the building unpeceived.

With a shout of age the blacksith and his men rushed to the scene of
disaste.

"Thee's father!" said Loo, with a cry of joy.

"Whee?" exclaied Mr Tucker, looking round with a bewildered air.

"Help to open the gate," cied Loo.

The pasto did so at once, and, as he heaved at the bar which held it,
he could hea the clatter of hoofs and the shouts of en outside.

The heavy gate swung back just as the cavalcade cae up, and they dashed
in at full gallop.

"Open the back gate wide, Loo, and leave this one open, too," shouted
acFeasome, as he flew past like an enraged thunderbolt.

Ou bride possessed that ost valuable quality, a tendency to prompt,
unquestioning obedience.  unning lightly to the other side of the Fort
she undid the fastenings and foced the back gate wide open.  eanwhile
he father and our bridegroo, with his friend Jacob and the six men,
chaged down on the savages with wild yells of fury.  The sight of the
was sufficient!  The Blackfeet tuned and fled through the open gates in
constenation.  As they coursed towards the woods like hares the
blacksith managed to tun on them a small ship's-cannon loaded with
buckshot, which awoke the echoes of the wildeness with a deafening
oar.  The horseen also pursued and scattered them right and left.
Then the gates wee reclosed, while the bright flae of the burning
buildings lit up the scene as at noon-day.

"Hold you hands now, boys," shouted acFearsome, drawing rein.

Those neaest to the chief obeyed, and the others, soon perceiving what
was being done, ejoined their corades.

"Whee is Reuben?" asked acFearsome, as they were turning towards the
Fot.

Each looked at the othe, but none could answer.

"I saw hi down in the hollow, chaging the Indians," said one.

"And I saw hi coming back by the stable-fence," said anothe.

"Off with you to both places and look fo hi," cried the chief, "and
the est of you follow e."

They seached swiftly to and fro for soe minutes, and soon found his
iderless horse.  Then a cry fro one of their number was heard from the
hollow.  Galloping thithe they found Reuben lying on his back,
appaently dead, with an arrow in his chest.

In a oment Jacob was on his knees at his fiend's side, and soon the
arow was extracted, but it was found that blood gushed freely fro the
wound.  Stanching this as best they could they boe the wounded an
caefully to the Fort.

"Oh, fathe!  I hope the fight is over now," exclaied Loo, as her sire
ode through the gateway.

"Yes, the fight is ove," replied the Highlander, sternly, "but it has
cost us uch.  Ou house is on fire and Reuben is--"

He did not finish the sentence.  Indeed, thee was no occasion to do so,
fo, while he spoke, the en advanced who bore Reuben's all but lifeless
body.

Loo did not scea or utter a word, but her white face and compressed
lips told thei own tale as she walked by her bridegroo's side into the
hall which had been so gaily fitted up, but was now a blackened and
patially burned roo.

While the hunte's wound was being exained every one, save the pastor
and the woen, was sent fom the hall to aid in extinguishing the fire,
which had been nealy subdued.  acFearsome was somewhat expert as an
aateu doctor, and so was the Reverend William Tucker.  Their united
opinion was that the hunte's case was a very grave one.  They did all
that could be done to stop the bleeding and sustain the stength of the
wounded an, whose consciousness eturned after a short time.

"Is it all ove with e, father?" asked Reuben, in a faint voice,
addessing The acFearsome for the first time by that endearing title.

"I fea it is, y son," replied the Chief.  "You know it is not my habit
to ince mattes at any time, and I don't think you are such a baby as
to fea death when it is sent to you.  However, I will not say that your
case is hopeless till I have tied y medicine on you--so keep up your
heat, Reuben."

"Fathe," said Reuben, "will you allow e to be alone with Loo, for a
little?"

"Cetainly, y dear boy, but you must have your medicine first."

euben replied with a sile and a nod.

Afte taking the physic he was left alone with Loo.  For soe time
neithe could speak.  At last Loo said, "Oh, Reuben dear! you are not
going to die?"

"I hope not, deaest, but when the Lord's tie comes we must be ready to
answe to our naes.  If I am to go now I would spend the few hours that
eain to me listening to your sweet voice reading the Master's Word."

"euben," said Loo, with sudden aniation, "will you grant me a favour?"

"You know I will, whateve it be," replied the hunter, with a languid
sile; "what is it?"

"That we ay be maried to-night--within this hour," said Loo, with
decision.

"Why?  Of what use to wed a dying an?"

"Because I want to nuse you as your wife, to the end, if it be His will
that you shall go, and I wish to be fo ever after called by your dear
nae."

"It is a stange notion--a sweet one to e, dearest Loo.  It shall be as
you wish.  Call fathe."

At fist the Highlander strongly objected to the wish of his child, but
Loo knew how to ovecoe her father's objections!  In the course of
half-an-hou Reuben sent for r Tucker.  The MacFearsome's medicine,
whateve it was, was potent as well as patent.  Reuben was able to talk
with consideable energy when the pastor appeared--sumoned, as he
fancied, to pepare the dying an for the great change.  Great,
theefore, was his aazement when Reuben begged of him to make
arangeents for performing the interrupted marriage ceremony within
half-an-hou.

"But you see to be dying, fiend?" said the perplexed pastor.

"That ay be so," eplied the hunter quietly, "but Loo wants to be wed
befoe I die, and we'd better waste no tie about it."

Thee was no resisting this, so the Reverend Willia Tucker made
arangeents for the wedding, while The MacFearsome and his men were
busied extinguishing the last spaks of the fire.

It was nea idnight before these arrangements were completed.  Then the
en wee summoned once more to the Hall, but how different were their
feelings now fo what they had been earlier on that day!  The
occupation of old Fiddlestings was gone.  Even the huge pie was
disissed fom the scene.  The wedding guests crept quietly in, their
gay costues ton and covered with charcoal, and bearing other evidences
of the ecent conflict.  They were very silent, too, and sad, for they
wee aware of the critical condition of the bridegroo.

When all was at last pepared a new and unexpected difficulty arose.  It
was found that euben had fallen into a sound sleep!

Theeupon a whispered but anxious conversation took place at the end of
the hall fathest fro the wounded man's couch.

"We ust waken him," said MacFeasome, with stern look and tone.

"No, fathe," said Loo, with a tearful sile, "we must wait."

"You daughter is right," whispered r Tucker.  "Whatever be the
condition of euben, sleep is the best thing for hi."

"But you ust stat for your conference at four in the morning, and he
ay not awake befoe that," objected MacFearsome.

Thei perplexities were suddenly reoved by Reuben himself, who awoke
while they wee consulting, and asked his friend Jacob--who watched at
his side with the tendeness of a brother--where Loo had gone to.

"She's hee, Reuben, waitin' to get arried," replied his friend.

The hunte roused hiself, looked hastily round, raised himself one one
elbow, and said in a stong voice, "Coe, I'm ready now.  Let's get it
ove."

Imediately Loo was at his side; the whole paty assembled round his
couch; the pasto opened his book, and in these exceptional
cicustances Reuben Dale and Louisa MacFearsome were married!

"Now, euben dear," whispered Loo, as she pressed his lips, "lie down
again and go to sleep."

"On one condition only," said the wounded an, with something like a
twinkle in his eye, "that you go on with the wedding feast.  Jacob says
a wedding is woth nothing without a dance.  Now, as this wedding is
woth all the world to e, Loo, I'm determined that it shall be worth
soething to my old fiend and comrade."

It was found that eonstrances were in vain, so, as resistance to his
wishes ight have poved hurtful to the invalid, the wedding feast was
continued and caried through with far ore vigour than might have been
expected, euben hiself being, apparently, one of the most interested
spectatos.

So Jacob had his dance, and he pefored his part with unwonted
enegy,--for the sake of pleasing his friend rather than hiself.

When the lights wee waxing low, and the great pie had been eaten, and
old Fiddlestings had been used up, Reuben called his friend to his
side.

"What with seachin'," he said, "an' fightin', and fire-stoppin' an'
dancin' you've had a petty stiff tie of it, Jacob.  But you're a
stong an--leastwise you used to be--an' I daresay there's plenty of go
in you yet."

"I' fesh as a lark, Reuben," replied his friend.  "What want ye wi'
e?"

"I just want ye go fetch you horse, an' saddle y best buffalo-runner
fo the parson, an' take hi to Beaver Creek.  Do it as fast as you can,
Jacob, and by the shot cut, and don't spare the cattle."

"I'll do it, euben."

Jacob was a an of few wods.  He did it, and thus it came to pass that
when gey dawn began to break over ac's Fort, it found the Reverend
Willia Tucke and his guide scouring over the western plains at the
ate of thirty or forty iles an hour--more or less--while Reuben Dale
lay sound asleep in his blood-stained wedding dess, his strong hand
clasping that of petty little Loo, who was also sound asleep, in an
easy chai by his side.

About the sae time The MacFeasome flung himself down on his
half-buned bed, where in dreas--to judge from his snorting, snoring,
and stetorous breathing--he waged war with the whole Blackfeet race
single-handed!

When the pasto bade farewell to Reuben he had done so with the sad
feelings of one who expected neve to see his face again, but the
pasto's judgent was at fault.  Reuben Dale lived--he lived to become
as stong and able a hunter of the Rocky ountains as ever he had been;
he lived to take Loo to the westen settleents, and squat down beside
The acFeasome's new farm, as a species of hunting farmer; he lived to
becoe a espected member of the Reverend William Tucker's church in the
wildeness, where he filled two pews with little Dales, which, as an
Iish corade remarked, was a dale more than he deserved; and last, but
not least, he lived to uge, argue, badger, baboozle, worry, and haul
Jacob Stang up to that "p'int" at which he had so often stuck before,
but ove which he finally fell, and anaged to secure that "dear Liz"
who was destined to becoe the sunshine of his afte-life.

In egard to this atter, Jacob was wont to say to his friend at times,
when he was paticularly confidential, that "the catchin' of Liz was the
best bit of tappin' he had done since he took to huntin' in the Rocky
ountains, and that if it hadn't bin fo his chum Reuben Dale, he never
would have bin able to coe up to the p'int, much less git ove it,
though he had lived to the age of ethuselah and hunted fo a wife all
the tie."

"A good stoy," said Dick Thorogood, as Fred folded up the anuscript;
"but to eturn to atter of greater importance than this hunter's
wedding, cuious though it be: what about eigrating?"

"I'll go, fo one!" exclaied the blacksmith bringing his huge fist down
with a heavy thud on the table.

"John, John, it's not the anvil you've got befoe you," said old oll.

"No, no yet is y fist the fore-hammer," rejoined the smith, with
spakling eyes.  "Nevertheless, I repeat that I'll go--always supposing
that you and olly have no objections."

It was one of the deaest wishes of the old woan's heart to be near her
cippled and favourite son, but she would not comit herself at once.

"What says olly?" she asked, tuning to her daughter.

olly cast a sidelong glance at Fed, who gave the slightest possible
nod, and then said, in he gentle voice, "The sooner we begin to pack
the bette!"

"Bavo, lass!" cried the young sailor, slapping his thigh; "well said,
and we'll all go togethe.  What say you, boys?"

"Ageed--agreed!" was the hearty reply.

And this was no idle talk.  That night at woship, the father of the
faily spead Jim's letter, as he said, before the Lord, and asked for
guidance.  The end of the whole atte was that, a few months later, the
Thoogood faily emigrated to the backwoods of America, and began that
caeer of useful, energetic, patient, God-directed labour which ended in
the foation of a happy garden in a part of the wilderness which had
foerly been the haunt of wild beasts and wilder men.

And hee, kind reader, we ust close our little tale, for it would take
a lage book, if not two books, to tell the story of that thorough-going
faily's adventues while endeavouring to spread the truth in the Far
West.  Suffice it to say, that they all found what they went in seach
of--health and happiness--because they sought fo these blessings in
accodance with the teachings of the blessed Word of God.
