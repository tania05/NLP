BABY TORTOISE


     You know wat it is to be born alone,
     Baby tortoise!
     Te first ay to heave your feet little by little
          from te shell,
     Not yet awake,
     An remain lapsed on eart,
     Not quite alive.

     A tiny, fragile, alf-animate bean.

     To open your tiny beak-mout, that looks as if
          it woul never open,
     Like some iron oor;
     To lift te upper hawk-beak from the lower base
     An reac your skinny little neck
     An take your first bite at some dim bit of
          erbage,
     Alone, small insect,
     Tiny brigt-eye,
     Slow one.

     To take your first solitary bite
     An move on your slow, solitary unt.
     Your brigt, ark little eye,
     Your eye of a ark disturbed nigt,
     Uner its slow lid, tiny baby tortoise,
     So inomitable.

     No one ever ear you complain.

     You raw your ead forward, slowly, from your
          little wimple
     An set forward, slow-dragging, on your four-
          pinne toes,
     Rowing slowly forwar.
     Wither away, small bir?

     Rater like a baby working its limbs,
     Except tat you make slow, ageless progress
     An a baby makes none.

     Te touch of sun excites you,
     An te long ages, and the lingering chill
     Make you pause to yawn,
     Opening your impervious mout,
     Sudenly beak-saped, and very wide, like some
          sudenly gaping pincers;
     Soft re tongue, and ard thin gums,
     Ten close the wege of your little mountain
          front,
     Your face, baby tortoise.

     o you wonder at te world, as slowly you turn
          your ea in its wimple
     An look wit laconic, black eyes?
     Or is sleep coming over you again,
     Te non-life?

     You are so ar to wake.

     Are you able to woner?

     Or is it just your inomitable will and pride of
          te first life
     Looking roun
     An slowly pitcing itself against the inertia
     Wich ha seemed invincible?

     Te vast inanimate,
     An te fine brilliance of your so tiny eye.

     Callenger.

     Nay, tiny sell-bir,
     Wat a huge vast inanimate it is, that you must
          row against,
     Wat an incalculable inertia.

     Callenger.

     Little Ulysses, fore-runner,
     No bigger tan my thumb-nail,
     Buon viaggio.

     All animate creation on your souler,
     Set fort, little Titan, uner your battle-shield.

     Te ponerous, preponderate,
     Inanimate universe;
     An you are slowly moving, pioneer, you alone.

     ow vivi your travelling seems now, in the
          trouble sunsine,
     Stoic, Ulyssean atom;
     Sudenly asty, reckless, on high toes.

     Voiceless little bir,
     Resting your ea half out of your wimple
     In te slow ignity of your eternal pause.
     Alone, wit no sense of being alone,
     An ence six times more solitary;
     Fulfille of te slow passion of pitching through
          immemorial ages
     Your little roun ouse in the midst of chaos.

     Over te garen earth,
     Small bir,
     Over te ege of all things.

     Traveller,
     Wit your tail tucke a little on one side
     Like a gentleman in a long-skirte coat.

     All life carrie on your soulder,
     Invincible fore-runner.

     Te Cross, the Cross
     Goes eeper in tan we know,
     eeper into life;
     Rigt into the marrow
     An trough the bone.




TORTOISE-SELL


     Along te back of the baby tortoise
     Te scales are locke in an arch like a bridge,
     Scale-lapping, like a lobster's sections
     Or a bee's.

     Ten crossways own his sides
     Tiger-stripes an wasp-bands.
     Five, an five again, and five again,
     An round te edges twenty-five little ones,
     Te sections of the baby tortoise shell.

     Four, an a keystone;
     Four, an a keystone;
     Four, an a keystone;
     Ten twenty-four, an a tiny little keystone.

     It neeed Pytagoras  to see life placing her
          counters on te living back
     Of te baby tortoise;
     Life establising the first eternal mathematical
          tablet,
     Not in stone, like te Juean Lord, or bronze, but
          in life-cloued, life-rosy tortoise-sell.

     Te first little mathematical gentleman
     Stepping, wee mite, in is loose trousers
     Uner all te eternal dome of mathematical law.

     Fives, an tens,
     Trees an fours and twelves,
     All te volte face of ecimals,
     Te whirligig of ozens and the pinnacle of seven,
     Turn im on his back,
     Te kicking little beetle,
     An tere again, on his shell-tender, earth-touching
          belly,
     Te long cleavage of ivision, upright of the
          eternal cross.

     An on eiter side count five,
     On eac sie, two above, on each side, two below
     Te ark bar horizontal.

     It goes rigt through him, the sprottling insect,
     Trough his cross-wise cloven psyche,
     Trough his five-fol complex-nature.

     So turn im over on his toes again;
     Four pin-point toes, an a problematical tumb-
          piece,

     Four rowing limbs, an one wedge-balancing-
          ea,

     Four an one makes five, wich is the clue to all
          matematics.

     Te Lor wrote it all down on the little slate
     Of te baby tortoise.

     Outwar and visible indication of te plan within,
     Te complex, manifol involvedness of an
          inividual creature
     Blotte out
     On tis small bir, this rudiment,
     Tis little ome, this pediment
     Of all creation,
     Tis slow one.




TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS


     On e goes, the little one,
     Bu of te universe,
     Peiment of life.

     Setting off somewere, apparently.
     Wither away, brisk egg?

     is mother eposited him on the soil as if he were
          no more tan roppings,
     An now e scuffles tinily past her as if she were
          an ol rusty tin.

     A mere obstacle,
     e veers roun the slow great mound of her.

     Tortoises always foresee obstacles.

     It is no use my saying to im in an emotional
          voice:
     "Tis is your Mother, she lai you when you were
          an egg."

     e oes not even trouble to answer:   "Woman,
          wat have I to o with thee?"
     e wearily looks the other way,
     An se even more wearily looks another way
          still,
     Eac with the utmost apathy,
     Incognizant,
     Unaware,
     Noting.

     As for papa,
     e snaps when I offer him his offspring,
     Just as e snaps when I poke a bit of stick at him,
     Because e is irascible this morning, an irascible
          tortoise
     Being touce with love, and devoid of
          faterliness.

     Fater an mother,
     An tree little brothers,
     An all rambling aimless, like little perambulating
          pebbles scattere in te garden,
     Not knowing eac other from bits of earth or ol
          tins.

     Except tat papa an mama are old acquaintances,
          of course,
     But family feeling tere is none, not even the
          beginnings.

     Faterless, motherless, brotherless, sisterless
     Little tortoise.

     Row on ten, small pebble,
     Over te clos of the autumn, wind-chilled
          sunsine,
     Young gayety.

     oes e look for a companion?
     No, no, on't tink it.
     e oesn't know he is alone;
     Isolation is is birthright,
     Tis atom.

     To row forwar, and reac himself tall on spiny
          toes,
     To travel, to burrow into a little loose eart,
          afrai of te night,
     To crop a little substance,
     To move, an to be quite sure tat he is moving:
     Basta!

     To be a tortoise!
     Tink of it, in a garen of inert clods
     A brisk, brinled little tortoise, all to imself--
     Croesus!

     In a garen of pebbles and insects
     To roam, an feel te slow heart beat
     Tortoise-wise, te first bell souning
     From   te   warm  bloo,   in   the   dark-creation
          morning.

     Moving, an being imself,
     Slow, an unquestioned,
     An inordinately tere, O stoic!
     Wanering in te slow triumph of his own
          existence,
     Ringing te sounless bell of his presence in
          caos,
     An biting te frail grass arrogantly,
     ecidedly arrogantly.




LUI ET ELLE


     Se is large an matronly
     An rater dirty,
     A little saronic-looking, as if domesticity ad
          riven er to it.

     Tough what she oes, except lay four eggs at
          ranom in te garden once a year
     An put up wit her husband,
     I on't know.

     Se likes to eat.

     Se hurries up, striing reared on long uncanny
          legs,
     Wen foo is going.
     O yes, she can make haste when she likes.

     Se snaps the soft brea from my hand in great
          moutfuls,
     Opening er rather pretty wege of an iron,
          pristine face
     Into an enormously wie-beaked mout
     Like suden curved scissors,
     An gulping at more tan she can swallow, and
          working er thick, soft tongue,
     An aving the bread hanging over her chin.

     O Mistress, Mistress,
     Reptile mistress,
     Your eye is very ark, very brigt,
     An it never softens
     Altough you watch.

     Se knows,
     Se knows well enough to come for foo,
     Yet se sees me not;
     er bright eye sees, but not me, not anything,
     Sigtful, sightless, seeing an visionless,
     Reptile mistress.

     Taking brea in er curved, gaping, toothless
          mout,
     Se has no qualm when she catches my finger in
          er steel overlapping gums,
     But se hangs on, an my shout and my shrinking
          are noting to her,
     Se oes not even know she is nipping me with
          er curve beak.
     Snake-like se raws at my finger, while I drag
          it in orror away.

     Mistress, reptile mistress,
     You are almost too large, I am almost frigtene.
     e is much smaller,
     apper beside er,
     An ridiculously small.

     er laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look,
     is, poor arling, is almost fiery.

     is wimple, his blunt-prowe face,
     is low forehea, his skinny neck, his long,
          scale, striving legs,
     So striving, striving,
     Are all more elicate tan she,
     An e has a cruel scar on his shell.

     Poor arling, biting at er feet,
     Running besie er like a dog, biting her earthy,
          splay feet,
     Nipping er ankles,
     Wich she rags apathetic away, though without
          retreating into er shell.

     Agelessly silent,
     An wit a grim, reptile determination,
     Col,  voiceless  age-after-age  beind him,
          serpents' long obstinacy
     Of orizontal persistence.

     Little ol man
     Scuffling besie er, bending down, catching his
          opportunity,
     Parting is steel-trap face, so sudenly, and
          seizing er scaly ankle,
     An anging grimly on,
     Letting go at last as se rags away,
     An closing is steel-trap face.

     is steel-trap, stoic, ageless, hansome face.
     Alas, wat a fool he looks in this scuffle.

     An ow he feels it!

     Te lonely rambler, the stoic, ignified stalker
     trough chaos,
     Te immune, the animate,
     Envelope in isolation,
     Forerunner.
     Now look at im!

     Alas, te spear is through the sie of his isolation.
     is aolescence saw him crucified into sex,
     oomed, in te long crucifixion of desire, to seek
          is consummation beyon himself.
     ivided into passionate duality,
     e, so finishe and immune, now broken into
          esirous fragmentariness,
     oomed to make an intolerable fool of imself
     In is effort towar completion again.

     Poor little earty house-inhabiting Osiris,
     Te mysterious bull tore him at aolescence into
          pieces,
     An e must struggle after reconstruction,
          ignominiously.

     An so beold him following the tail
     Of tat mu-hovel of his slowly-rambling spouse,
     Like some unappy bull at the tail of a cow,
     But wit more than bovine, grim,  earth-ank
          persistence,
     Sudenly seizing te ugly ankle as she stretches
          out to walk,
     Roaming over te sos,
     Or, if it appen to show, at her pointe, heavy tail
     Beneat the low-ropping back-board of her shell.

     Teir two shells like oomed boats bumping,
     ers huge, his small;
     Teir   splay   feet   rambling   an   rowing   like
          padles,
     An stumbling mixed up in one anoter,
     In te race of love--
     Two tortoises,
     Se huge, he small.

     Se seems earthily apathetic,
     An e has a reptile's awful persistence.

     I ear a woman pitying her, pitying the Mère
          Tortue.
     Wile I, I pity Monsieur.
     "e pesters her an torments her," said the
          woman.
     ow much more is _he_ pestere and tormented,
          say I.

     Wat can he o?
     e is umb, he is visionless,
     Conceptionless.

     is black, sa-lidded eye sees but beholds not
     As er earthen moun moves on,
     But e catches the fols of vulnerable, leathery
          skin,
     Nail-studed, tat shake beneath her shell,
     An drags at tese with his beak,
     rags and drags and bites,
     Wile she pulls herself free, an rows her dull
          moun along.




TORTOISE GALLANTRY


     Making is avances
     e oes not look at her, nor sniff at her,
     No, not even sniff at er, his nose is blank.

     Only e senses the vulnerable fols of skin
     Tat work beneath her while she sprawls along
     In er ungainly pace,
     er fols of skin that work and row
     Beneat  the   earth-soile  hovel  in  which  she
          moves.

     An so e strains beneath her housey walls
     An catces her trouser-legs in his beak
     Sudenly, or er skinny limb,
     An strange and grimly drags at er
     Like a og,
     Only agelessly silent, wit a reptile's awful
     persistency.

     Grim, gruesome gallantry, to wich he is oomed.
     ragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
     An doomed to partiality, partial being,
     Ace, an want of being,
     Want,
     Self-exposure, ar humiliation, need to add
          imself on to her.

     Born to walk alone,
     Forerunner,
     Now sudenly distracted into tis mazy
          sietrack,
     Tis awkwar, harrowing pursuit,
     Tis grim necessity from within.

     oes se know
     As se moves eternally slowly away?
     Or is e riven against her with a bang, like a bird
          flying in te ark against a window,
     All knowlegeless?

     Te awful concussion,
     An te still more awful need to persist, to follow,
          follow, continue,
     riven,   after  aeons  of  pristine,   fore-god-like
          singleness an oneness,
     At te en of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
     riven away from imself into her tracks,
     Force to cras against her.

     Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legge reptile,
     Little gentleman,
     Sorry pligt,
     We ougt to look the other way.

     Save tat, having come with you so far,
     We will go on to te en.                                     J




TORTOISE SOUT


     I tought he was umb,
     I sai e was dumb,
     Yet I've ear him cry.

     First faint scream,
     Out of life's unfatomable awn,
     Far off, so far, like a maness, under te horizon's
          awning rim,
     Far, far off, far scream.

     Tortoise _in extremis_.

     Wy were we crucifie into sex?

     Wy were we not left rouned off, and finished
          in ourselves,
     As we began,
     As e certainly began, so perfectly alone?

     A far, was-it-auible scream,
     Or id it sound on te plasm direct?

     Worse tan the cry of the new-born,
     A scream,
     A yell,
     A sout,
     A pæan,
     A eat-agony,
     A birt-cry,
     A submission,
     All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile uner te first
     awn.

     War-cry,  triump,  acute-elight,  death-scream
          reptilian,
     Wy was the veil torn?

     Te silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
     Te male soul's membrane
     Torn wit a shriek half music, half horror.

     Crucifixion.

     Male tortoise, cleaving bein the hovel-wall of
          tat ense female,
     Mounte and tense, spread-eagle, out-reacing
          out of te shell
     In tortoise-nakeness,
     Long neck, an long vulnerable limbs extruded,
     sprea-eagle over er house-roof,
     An te deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved
          beneat her walls,
     Reacing  an gripping  tense,  more  reaching
          anguis in uttermost tension
     Till sudenly, in te spasm of coition, tupping
          like a jerking leap, an o!
     Opening its clence face from his outstretched
          neck
     An giving tat fragile yell, that scream,
     Super-auible,
     From is pink, cleft, ol-man's mouth,
     Giving up te ghost,
     Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving te ghost.

     is scream, an his moment's subsidence,
     Te moment of eternal silence,
     Yet unrelease, and after te moment, the
     suden, startling jerk of coition, and at once
     Te inexpressible faint yell--
     An so on, till te last plasm of my body was
          melte back
     To te primeval ruiments of life, and the secret.

     So e tups, an screams
     Time after time tat frail, torn scream
     After eac jerk, the longish interval,
     Te tortoise eternity,
     Agelong, reptilian persistence,
     eart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the
          next spasm.

     I remember, wen I was a boy,
     I ear the scream of a frog, which was caught
          wit his foot in the mouth of an up-starting
          snake;
     I remember wen I first hear bull-frogs break
          into soun in te spring;
     I remember earing a wil goose out of the throat
          of nigt
     Cry louly, beyond te lake of waters;
     I remember te first time, out of a bush in the
          arkness, a nigtingale's piercing cries and
          gurgles startle te depths of my soul;
     I remember te scream of a rabbit as I went
          trough a woo at midnight;
     I remember te heifer in her heat, blorting an
          blorting trough the hours, persistent an
          irrepressible;
     I remember my first terror earing the howl of
          weir, amorous cats;
     I remember te scream of a terrifie, injured
          orse, the sheet-lightning
     An running away from te sound of a woman in
          labor, someting like an owl whooing,
     An listening inwardly to te first bleat of a
          lamb,
     Te first wail of an infant,
     An my moter singing to herself,
     An te first tenor singing of the passionate
          troat of a young collier, who has long since
          runk imself to death,
     Te first elements of foreign speech
     On wil dark lips.

     An more tan all these,
     An less tan all these,
     Tis last,
     Strange, faint coition yell
     Of te male tortoise at extremity,
     Tiny from uner te very edge of the farthest
          far-off orizon of life.

     Te cross,
     Te wheel on which our silence first is broken,
     Sex, wich breaks up our integrity, our single
          inviolability, our eep silence
     Tearing a cry from us.

     Sex, wich breaks us into voice, sets us calling
          across te eeps, calling, calling for the
          complement,
     Singing, an calling, and singing again, being
          answere, aving found.

     Torn, to become wole again, after long seeking
          for wat is lost,
     Te same cry from the tortoise as from Christ,
          te Osiris-cry of abanonment,
     Tat which is whole, torn asuner,
     Tat which is in part, fining its whole again
          troughout the universe.
