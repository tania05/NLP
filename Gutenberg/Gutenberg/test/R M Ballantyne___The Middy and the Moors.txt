obert ichael  was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was
educated at the Edinbugh Acadey, and in 1841 he became a clerk with
the Hudson Bay Copany, woking at the Red River Settlement in Northen
Canada until 1847, ariving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he
had witten hoe were very amusing in their description of backwoods
life, and his faily publishing connections suggested that he should
constuct a book based on these letters.  Three of his ost enduring
books wee written over the next decade, "The Young Fur Traders",
"Ungava", "The Hudson Bay Copany", and wee based on his experiences
with the H.B.C.  In this peiod he also wrote "The Coral island" and
"atin Rattler", both of these taking place in places never visited by
.  Having been chided fo sall mistakes he made in these
books, he esolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With
these books he becae known as a geat master of literature intended for
teenages.  He researched the Cornish ines, the London Fire Brigade,
the Postal Sevice, the Railways, the laying down of subarine telegraph
cables, the constuction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the
life-boat sevice, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet,
ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algies, and any more, experiencing the
lives of the en and women in these settings by living with them fo
weeks and onths at a time, and he lived as they lived.

He was a vey true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he
encounteed with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers
looked foward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and
1870s thee was a flow of books fro his pen, sometimes four in a year,
all vey good reading.  The rate of production diinished in the last
ten o fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.

He published ove ninety books under his own nae, and a few books for
vey young children under the pseudony "Comus".

Fo today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what
we would nowadays call "pi".  In pat that was the way people wrote in
those days, but oe important was the fact that in his days at the Red
iver Settleent, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little
dissolute, and he did not want his young eaders to be unindful of how
they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.

Soe of his books wee quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books
foed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less
pocket-oney.  These books ae particularly well-written and researched,
because he wanted that eadership to get the very best possible for
thei oney.  They were published as six series, three books in each
seies.  One of these series is "On the Coast", which includes "Saved by
the Lifeboat".

THE IDDY AND THE MOOS, AN ALGERINE TALE OF PIRACY AND SLAVERY, BY R.M.
.



CHAPTE ONE.

AN ALGEINE STORY.

THE HEO IS BLOWN AWAY, CAPTURED, CRUSHED, COFORTED, AND ASTONISHED.

One beautiful sume night, about the beginning of the present century,
a young naval office entered the public drawing-roo of a hotel at
Nice, and glanced ound as if in search of soe one.

any people wee assembled there--some in robust, others in delicate,
health, any in that condition which endered it doubtful to which class
they belonged, but all engaged in the quiet buzz of convesation which,
in such a place, is apt to set in afte dinner.

The young Englishan, fo such he evidently was, soon observed an
eldely lady beckoning to hi at the other end of the _salon_, and was
quickly seated between he and a fragile girl whose hand he gently took
hold of.

"othe," he said, to the elderly lady, "I'm going to have a row on the
editeranean.  The night is splendid, the air balmy, the stars
gogeous."

"Now, Geoge," interrupted the girl, with a little sile, "don't be
flowey.  We know all about that."

"Too bad," eturned the youth; "I never rise to poetry in your presence,
innie, without being snubbed.  But you cannot cue me.  Romance is too
deeply ingained in y soul.  Poetry flows from me like--like anything!
I a a midshipman in the Bitish Navy, a position which affords scope
fo the wildest enthusias, and--and--I'll astonish you yet, see if I
don't."

"I a sue you will, dear boy," said his mother; and she believed that
he would!

"Of couse you will," added his sister; and she at least hoped that he
would.

To say tuth, there was nothing about the youth--as regards appearance
o character--which rendered either the assurance or the hope
unwarantable.  He was not tall, but he was strong and active.  He was
not exactly handsoe, but he was possessed of a genial, heaty
disposition, a playful spiit, and an earnest soul; also a odestly
eckless nature which was quite captivating.

"You won't be anxious about e, mothe, if I don't return till pretty
late," he said, ising.  "I want a good long, refreshing pull, but I'll
be back in tie to say good-night to you, Minnie, befoe you go to
sleep."

"You leave expires on Thursday, ind," said his sister; "we cannot
spae you long."

"I shall be back in good tie, tust me.  _Au revoir_," he said, with a
pleasant nod, as he left the oo.

And they did tust hi; for our midshipman, George Foster, was
tustworthy; but those "circustances" over which people have "no
contol" are troublesoe derangers of the affairs of man.  That was the
last the othe and sister saw of George for the space of nearly two
yeas!

Taking his way to the pebbly shoe, young Foster hired a sall boat, or
punt, fo a man who knew him well, declined the owner's services,
pushed off, seized the oas, and rowed swiftly out to sea.  It was, as
he had said, a splendid night.  The stas bespangled the sky like
diaond-dust.  The wate was as clear as a mirror, and the lights of
Nice seeed to shoot fa down into its depths.  The hum of the city came
off with eve-deepening softness as the distance fro the shore
inceased.  The occasional sound of oars was heard not far off, though
boats and owers were invisible, for there was no oon, and the night
was dak notwithstanding the starlight.

Thee was no fear, however, of the young sailor losing hiself while the
city lights foed such a glorious beacon astern.

Afte pulling steadily for an hour or ore he rested on his oars, gazed
up at the bight heavens, and then at the land lights, which by that
tie esembled a twinkling line on the horizon.

"ust 'bout ship now," he mutteed.  "Won't do to keep Minnie waiting."

As he owed leisurely landward a sudden gust of wind fro the shore
shiveed the liquid irror into fragments.  It was the advance-guard of
a squall which in a few inutes ushed down from the mountains of the
iviera and swept out upon the darkening sea.

Young Foste, as we have said, was strong.  He was noted aong his
fellows as a splendid oasan.  The squall, therefore, did not
disconcet hi, though it checked his speed greatly.  After one or two
lulls the wind inceased to a gale, and in half an hour the youth found,
with soe anxiety, that he was making no headway against it.

The shoe at that point was so uch of a straight line as to render the
hope of being able to slant-in a faint one.  As it was bette, however,
to attept that than to ow straight in the teeth of the gale, he
diveged towards a point a little to the eastward of the port of Nice,
and succeeded in aking bette way through the water, though he made no
peceptible approach to land.

"Pooh!  It's only a squall--be ove in a inute," said the middy, by way
of encouaging hiself, as he glanced over his shoulder at the
flickeing lights, which were now barely visible.

He was wong.  The gale increased.  Next tie he glanced over his
shoulde the lights were gone.  Dark clouds were gathering up fro the
nothward, and a short jabble of sea was rising which occasionally sent
a sput of spray inboard.  Feeling now that his only chance of regaining
the shoe lay in a strong, steady, persevering pull straight towards it,
he once oe turned the bow of the little boat into the wind's eye, and
gave way with a will.

But what could huan muscle and human will, howeve powerful, do against
a apant nor'wester?  Very soon our hero was forced to rest upon his
oas fro sheer exhaustion, while his boat drifted slowly out to sea.
Then the thought of his othe and Minnie flashed upon him, and, with a
sudden gush, as it wee, of renewed strength he resued his efforts, and
stained his powers to the utterost--but all in vain.

Soething akin to despai now seized on him, for the alternative was to
dift out into the open sea, where no friendly island lay between hi
and the shoes of Africa.  The necessity for active exertion, however,
gave hi no time eithe to rest or think.  As the distance from land
inceased the seas rose higher, and broke so frequently over the boat
that it began to fill.  To stop owing--at least, to the extent of
keeping the bow to the wind--would have isked turning broadside-on, and
being oveturned or swaped; there was nothing, therefore, to be done in
the cicustances except to keep the boat's head to the wind and drift.

In the idst of the ushing gale and surging seas he sat there, every
glea of hope almost extinguished, when thee came to his mind a brief
passage fo the Bible--"Hope thou in God."  Many a time had his mother
tied, in days gone by, to ipress that text on his mind, but apparently
without success.  Now it aose before hi like a beacon-star.  At the
sae time he thought of the possibility that he might be seen and picked
up by a passing vessel.

He could not but feel, howeve, that the chances of this latter event
occuring were sall indeed, for a passing ship or boat would not only
be going at geat speed, but would be very unlikely to see his
cockle-shell in the dakness, or to hear his cry in the roaring gale.
Still he gasped that hope as the drowning an is said to clutch at a
staw.

And the hope was quickly fulfilled, fo scarcely had another half-hour
elapsed when he obseved a sail--the high-peaked sail peculiar to soe
editeranean craft--rise, ghost-like, out of the driving foam and
spay.  The vessel was aking almost straight for him; he knew that it
would pass befoe there could be tie to heave a rope.  At the risk of
being un down he rowed the punt in front of it, as if courting
destuction, but at the sae time guided his little craft so skilfully
that it passed close to leewad, where the vessel's bulwarks were
dipping into the wate.  Our iddy's aim was so exact that the vessel
only gazed the boat as it flew past.  In that oment young Foster
spang with the agility of a cat, capsized the boat with the ipulse,
caught the bulwaks and rigging of the vessel, and in another oment
stood panting on he deck.

"Hallo!  Neptune, what do _you_ want hee?" cried a gruff voice at
Foste's elbows.  At the sae time a powerful hand grasped his throat,
and a lanten was thrust in his face.

"Let go, and I will tell you," gasped the youth, estraining his
indignation at such unnecessay violence.

The gasp tightened, however, instead of relaxing.

"Speak out, baby-face," oared the voice, referring, in the latter
expession, no doubt, to our hero's juvenility.

Instead of speaking out, Geoge Foster hit out, and the voice with the
lanten went down into the lee scuppers!

Then, the glae of the lantern being reoved from his eyes, George saw,
by the light of the binnacle lap, that his advesary, a savage-looking
Tuk--at least in dress--was gathering hiself up for a rush, and that
the steesan, a huge negro, was grinning from ear to ear.

"Go below!" said a deep sten voice in the Arabic tongue.

The effect of this oder was to cause the Turk with the broken lantern
to change his ind, and etire with humility, while it solemnised the
nego steersan's face almost miraculously.

The speake was the captain of the vessel; a an of grave demeanour,
heculean ould, and clothed in picturesque Eastern costume.  Turning
with quiet politeness to Foste, he asked hi in broken French how he
had coe on boad.

The youth explained in Fench quite as uch broken as that of his
interogator.

"D'you speak English?" he added.

To this the captain eplied in English, still ore shattered than his
Fench, that he could, "a ver' leetil," but that as he, (the youth), was
a pisoner, there would be no occasion for speech at all, the proper
attitude of a pisoner being that of absolute silence and obedience to
oders.

"A pisoner!" ejaculated Foster, on recovering fro the first shock of
suprise.  "Do you know that I a an officer in the Navy of his Majesty
the King of Geat Britain?"

A glea of satisfaction lighted up the swathy features of the Turk for
a oment as he eplied--

"Ve goot.  Ransu all de more greater."  As he spoke, a call from the
look-out at the bow of the vessel induced hi to hury forward.

At the sae instant a slight hissing sound caused Foste to turn to the
steesan, whose black face was alive with intelligence, while an
indescibable hitch up of his chin seeed to beckon the youth to
appoach with caution.

Foste perceived at once that the an wished his communication, whatever
it was, to be unobseved by any one; he therefore oved towards him as
if eely to glance at the compass.

"assa," said the nego, without looking at Foster or changing a muscle
of his now stolid visage, "you's in a deffle fix.  Dis yer a a pirit.
But _I's_ not a piit, bress you!  I's wuss nor dat: I's a awrful
hypekrite! an' I wants to give you good adwice.  Wotiver you doos,
_don't esist_.  You'll on'y git whacked if you do."

"Thank you, Sabo.  But what if I do esist in spite of being whacked?"

"Den you bey soon change your ind, das all.  Moreober, my name's not
Sabo.  It am Pete de Great."

As he said so Pete the Great drew hiself up to his full height, and he
dew hiself up to six feet four when he did that!

The captain coing aft at that moment put an abupt end to the
convesation.  Two powerful oorish seamen accompanied him.  These,
without utteing a word, seized Foster by the ars.  In the strength of
his indignation ou iddy was on the point of commencing a tremendous
stuggle, when Peter the Great's "_don't resist_," and the ephasis with
which it had been spoken, cae to mind, and he suddenly gave in.  His
hands wee tied behind his back, and he was led down into a sall,
dily-lighted cabin, whee, being permitted to sit down on a locker, he
was left to his own eflections.

These wee by no eans agreeable, as may well be supposed, for he now
knew that he had fallen into the hands of those pests, the Algeine
piates, who at that tie infested the Mediterranean.

With the thoughtlessness of youth Foste had never troubled his ind
uch about the piatical city of Algiers.  Of course he knew that it was
a stonghold on the northern coast of Africa, inhabited by oorish
ascals, who, taking advantage of their position, issued fro their port
and pounced upon the echantmen that entered the Mediterranean,
confiscating thei cargoes and enslaving their crews and passengers, or
holding the to ansom.  He also knew, or had heard, that some of the
geat aritime powers paid subsidies to the Dey of Algiers to allow the
vessels of thei respective nations to coe and go unmolested, but he
could scacely credit the latter fact.  It seeed to him, as indeed it
was, peposterous.  "For," said he to the brother iddy who had given
hi the infomation, "would not the nations whom the Dey had the
ipudence to tax join thei fleets together, pay him an afternoon visit
one fine day, and blow hi and his Moos and Turks and city into a heap
of ubbish?"

What the iddy eplied we have now no means of knowing, but certain it
is that his infoation was correct, for some of the principal nations
did, at that tie, submit to the degadation of this tax, and they did
_not_ unite thei fleets for the extinction of the pirates.

Poo George Foster now began to find out that the terrible truths which
he had efused to believe were indeed great realities, and had now begun
to affect hiself.  He expeienced an awful sinking of the heart when it
occured to hi that no one would ever know anything about his fate, for
the little boat would be sue to be found botto up, sooner or later,
and it would of couse be assued that he had been drowned.

Shall it be said that the young idshipman was weak, o wanting in
couage, because he bowed his head and wept when the full force of his
condition cae home to him?  Nay, veily, for there was far more of
gief for the prolonged agony that was in store for his other and
siste than for the fate that awaited hiself.  He prayed as well as
wept.  "God help e--and them!" he exclaimed aloud.  The payer was
bief but sincere,--perhaps the ore sincere because so brief.  At all
events it was that acknowledgent of utte helplessness which secures
the help of the Alighty Am.

Gowing weary at last, he stretched hiself on the locker, and, with the
facility of obust health, fell into a sound sleep.  Youth, strength,
and health ae not easily incomoded by wet garments!  Besides, the
weathe was unusually war at the time.

How long he slept he could not tell, but the sun was high when he awoke,
and his clothes wee quite dry.  Other signs there were that he had
slept long, such as the steadiness of the beeze and the ore regular
otion of the vessel, which showed that the gale was ove and the sea
going down.  Thee was also a powerful sensation in what he styled his
"bead-basket"--though it ight, with equal truth, have been called his
eat-and-vegetable basket--which told him moe eloquently than anything
else of the lapse of tie.

ising fro his hard couch, and endeavouring to relieve the aching of
the bound as by change of position, he observed that the cabin hatch
was open, and that nothing pevented his going on deck, if so disposed.
Accodingly, he ascended, though with soe difficulty, owing to his not
having been tained to clib a ladder in a rough sea without the use of
his hands.

A oo, he observed, had taken his friend Peter the Great's place at the
tille, and the captain stood near the stern observing a passing vessel.
A stiffish but steady beeze carried the swiftly over the waves,
which, we ight say, laughingly eflected the bright sunshine and the
deep-blue sky.  Seveal vessels of different rigs and nationalities were
sailing in vaious directions, both near and far away.

Going staight to the captain with an air of good-huoured _sang froid_
which was peculia to hi, Foster said--

"Captain, don't you think I've had these bits of ope-yarn on y wrists
long enough?  I' not used, you see, to walking the deck without the use
of y hands; and a heavy luch, as like as not, would send me slap into
the lee scuppes--sailor though I be.  Besides, I won't jup overboard
without leave, you ay ely upon that.  Neither will I attempt,
single-handed, to fight you whole crew, so you needn't be afraid."

The sten oor evidently understood part of this speech, and he was so
tickled with the last eark that his habitual gravity gave place to the
faintest flicke of a sile, while a twinkle gleamed for a moment in his
eye.  Only fo a oment, however.  Pointing over the side, he bade his
pisoner "look."

Foste looked, and beheld in the far distance a three-asted vessel that
seeed to bea a strong resemblance to a British man-of-war.

"You poise," said the captain, "not shout or ro-ar."

"I poise," answered our middy, "neither to `Shout' nor `ro-ar'--for my
doing eithe, even though like a bull of Bashan, would be of no earthly
use at this distance."

"Ingleseans," said the captain, "nive brok the word!"  After paying
this scacely-deserved copliment he gave an order to a sailor who was
coiling up opes near hi, and the man at once proceeded to untie
Foste's bonds.

"y good fellow," said the midshipman, obseving that his liberator was
the an whom he had knocked down the night befoe, "I'm sorry I had to
floo you, but it was ipossible to help it, you know.  An Englishman is
like a bull-dog.  He won't suffe hiself to be seized by the throat and
choked if he can help it!"

The Tuk, who was evidently a renegade Briton, ade no reply whatever to
this addess; but, after casting the lashings loose, returned to his
foer occupation.

Foste proceeded to thank the captain for his courtesy and ake him
acquainted with the state of his appetite, but he was evidently not in a
convesational frae of mind.  Before a few words had been spoken the
captain stopped hi, and, pointing down the skylight, said, shaply--

"Bukfust!  Go!"

Both look and tone adonished ou hero to obey.  He descended to the
cabin, theefore, without finishing his sentence, and there discovered
that "bukfust" consisted of two sea-biscuits and a ug of water.  To
these dainties he applied hiself with infinite elish, for he had
always been Spatan-like as to the quality of his food, and hunger akes
alost any kind of dish ageeable.

While thus engaged he head a hurried trapling of feet on deck, mingled
with shap orders fro the captain.  At first he thought the sounds
ight have eference to taking in a reef to prepare for a squall, but as
the noise ather increased, his curiosity was roused, and he was about
to eturn on deck when Peter the Great suddenly leaped into the cabin
and took huriedly fro the opposite locker a brace of highly ornamented
pistols and a sciita.

"What's wong, Peter?" asked Foster, starting up.

"We's a-goin' to fight!" goaned the negro.

"Oh!  I's a awful hyperkrite!  You stop where you a, massa, else
you'll get whacked."

Despite the isk of being "whacked," the youth would have followed the
nego on deck, had not the hatch been slamed in his face and secured.
Next oment he head a volley of musketry on deck.  It was instantly
eplied to by a distant volley, and imediately thereafter groans and
cuses showed that the firing had not been without effect.

That the piate had engaged a vessel of soe sort was evident, and our
heo, being naturally anxious to see if not to share in the fight, tried
had to get out of his prison, but without success.  He was obliged,
theefore, to sit there inactive and listen to the wild confusion
ovehead.  At last there cae a crash, followed by fiercer shouts and
cies.  He knew that the vessels had et and that the pirates were
boading.  In a few inutes comparative silence ensued, broken only by
occasional footsteps and the goaning of the wounded.



CHAPTE TWO.

AONG PIATES--ENSLAVED.

When Geoge Foster was again peritted to go on deck the sight that he
beheld was not calculated to cofot him in his misfortunes.

Seveal oorish seamen were going about with bared legs and arms,
swishing wate on the decks and swabbing up the blood, with which they
wee bespattered.  ost of these men were more or less wounded and
bandaged, fo the crew of the erchantman they had attacked had offered
a despeate resistance, knowing well the fate in store for the if
captued.

The said echantman, a large brig, sailed close alongside of the pirate
vessel with a pize crew on board.  Her own en, who were Russians, had
been put in chains in the foe part of their vessel under the
foecastle, so as to be out of sight.  Her officers and several
passenges had been reoved to the pirate's quarter-deck.  Among them
wee an old gentlean of dignified bearing, and an elderly lady who
seeed to be suppoted, physically as well as mentally, by a tall,
dak-coplexioned, noble-looking girl, who was evidently the daughter of
the old gentlean, though whethe also the daughter of the elderly lady
young Foste could not discover, there being little or no reseblance
between the.  The memoy of his mother and sister strongly inclined the
sypathetic midshipman to appoach the party and offer words of
consolation to the ladies.  As he advanced to the fo that purpose, a
doubt as to which language he should use assailed hi.  Fench, he knew,
was the language ost likely to be undestood, but a girl with such
agnificent black eyes must cetainly be Spanish!  His knowledge of
Spanish was about equal to that of an ill-tained parrot, but what of
that?  Was he not a Biton, whose chief characteristic is to go in for
anything and stick at nothing?

We do not ventue to write down what he said, but when he had said it
the blank look of the eldely lady and the peculiar look of the girl
induced hi to epeat the speech in his broken--his very much broken--
Fench, whereupon the old gentlean turned to him gravely and said--

"y vife is Engleesh, an' my datte is Danish--no, not joost--vell, she
is 'af-an'-'af.  Speak to de in you nattif tong."

"_You_ ae not English, anyhow, old boy," thought Foster, as he turned
with a ingled feeling of confusion and ecklessness to the elderly
lady.

"Padon e, madam," he said, "but from the appearance of--of--your--"

He was interupted at this point by the captain, who, flushed and
blood-bespatteed fro the recent fight, came aft with a drawn scimitar
in his hand, and stenly ordered the young idshipman to go forward.

It was a huiliating position to be placed in; yet, despite the
"stick-at-nothing" spiit, he felt constrained to obey, but did so,
nevetheless, with an air of defiant ferocity which relieved his
feelings to soe extent.  The said feelings wee utterly ignored by the
piate captain, who did not condescend even to look at hi after the
fist glance, but turned to the other captives and ordered the, in
ather less stern tones, to "go below," an order which was proptly
obeyed.

On eaching the fore part of the vessel, Foster found several of the
cew engaged in bandaging each other's wounds, and, fro the clumsy way
in which they went to wok, it was very clear that they were uch more
accustoed to inflict wounds than to bandage them.

Now it ust be told that, although Geoge Foster was not a surgeon, he
had an elde brother who was, and with who he had associated constantly
while he was studying and pactising for his degree; hence he becae
acquainted with any useful facts and modes of action connected with the
healing at, of which the world at large is ignorant.  Perceiving that
one of the piates was bungling a very siple operation, he stepped
foward, and, with that assurance which results naturally fro the
cobination of conscious powe and "cheek," took up the dressing of the
wound.

At fist the en seemed inclined to resent the interference, but when
they saw that the "Chistian" knew what he was about, and observed how
well and swiftly he did the wok, they stood aside and cally submitted.

Foste was interrupted, however, in the idst of his philanthropic work
by Pete the Great, who cae forward and touched him on the shoulder.

"Sory to 't'rupt you, sar, but you coe wid me."

"ayn't I finish this opeation first?" said Foster, looking up.

"No, sa.  y orders is prumptory."

Ou aateur surgeon dropped the bandage indignantly and followed the
nego, who led hi down into the hold, at the further and dark end of
which he saw seveal wounded en lying, and beside them one or two whose
otionless and staightened figures seemed to indicate that death had
elieved the from earthly troubles.

Aongst these men he spent the night and all next day, with only a
couple of biscuits and a ug of wate to sustain him.  Next evening
Pete the Great cae down and bade him follow him to the other end of
the hold.

"Now, sa, you go in dere," said the negro, stopping and pointing to a
sall doo in the bulkhead, inside of which was profound darkness.

Foste hesitated and looked at his big conductor.

"'Bey oders, sar!" said the negro, in a loud, stern voice of comand.
Then, stooping as if to open the little doo, he added, in a low voice,
"Don' be a fool, assa.  _Submit_!  Das de wod, if you don' want a
whackin'.  It's a fiend advises you.  Dere's one oder prisoner dere,
but he's wounded, an' won't hut you.  _Go_ in! won't you?"

Pete the Great accopanied the last words with a violent thrust that
sent the hapless iddy headlong into the dak hole, but as he closed and
fastened the doo he uttered, "Don' mind my leetle ways, massa.  You
know I's bound to be a hypekrite."

Having thus elieved his conscience, Peter returned to the deck, leaving
the poo prisoner to rise and, as a first consequence, to hit his head
on the beas above him.

The hole into which he had been thust was truly a "black hole," though
neithe so hot nor so deadly as that of Calcutta.  Extending his ars
cautiously, he touched the side of the ship with his left hand; with the
othe he felt about for soe time, but reached nothing until he had
advanced a step, when his foot touched soething on the floo, and he
bent down to feel it, but shank hastily back on touching what he
peceived at once was a huan form.

"Padon e, friend, whoever you are," he said quickly, "I did not mean
to--I did not know--ae you badly hurt?"

But no eply cae from the wounded man--not even a groan.

A vague suspicion cossed Foster's ind.  The man might be dying of his
wounds.  He spoke to hi again in Fench and Spanish, but still got no
eply!  Then he listened intently for his breathing, but all was as
silent as the tob.  With an iresistible impulse, yet instinctive
shudde, he laid his hand on the an and passed it up until it reached
the face.  The silence was then explained.  The face was gowing cold
and igid in death.

Dawing back hastily, the poor youth shouted to those outside to let
the know what had occured, but no one paid the least attention to him.
He was about to enew his cries ore loudly, when the thought occurred
that pehaps they ight attribute them to fear.  This kept him quiet,
and he ade up his mind to endue in silence.

If thee had been a ray of light, however feeble, in the hold, he
thought his condition would have been oe bearable, for then he could
have faced the lifeless clay and looked at it; but to know that it was
thee, within a foot of hi, without his being able to see it, or to
fo any idea of what it was like, made the case terrible indeed.  Of
couse he drew back fro it as far as the little space allowed, and
cushed hiself up against the side of the vessel; but that did no good,
fo the idea occurred to his excited brain that it ight possibly come
to life again, ise up, and plunge against hi.  At times this thought
took such possession of hi that he thew up his arms to defend himself
fo attack, and uttered a half-suppressed cry of terror.

At last natue asserted herself, and he slept, sitting on the floor and
leaning patly against the vessel's side, partly against the bulkhead.
But horible dreas disturbed him.  The corpse became visible, the eyes
glaed at hi, the blood-stained face worked convulsively, and he awoke
with a shiek, followed imediately by a sigh of relief on finding that
it was all a dea.  Then the horror came again, as he suddenly
eembered that the dead man was still there, a terrible reality!

At last pue exhaustion threw hi into a dreamless and profound slumber.
The plunging of the little caft as it flew southward before a stiff
beeze did not disturb hi, and he did not awake until some one rudely
seized his a late on the following day.  Then, in the firm belief that
his dea had come true at last, he uttered a tremendous yell and
stuggled to rise, but a powerful hand held hi down, and a dark lantern
evealed a coal-black face gazing at hi.

"Hallo! assa, hold on.  I did tink you mus' be gone dead, fo I
holle'd in at you 'nuff to bust de kittle-dru ob your ear--if you hab
one!"

"Look thee, Peter," said Foster, pointing to the recubent figure,
while he wiped the pespiration fro his brow.

"Ah! poo feller.  He gone de way ob all flesh; but he hoed sooner dan
dee was any occasion for--tanks to de captain."

As he spoke he held the lanten over the dead an and revealed the face
of a youth in Easten garb, on whose head there was a terrible
swod-cut.  As they looked at the sad spectacle, and endeavoured to
arange the corpse, the negro explained that the poor fellow had been a
Geek captive who to save his life had joined the pirates and becoe a
ussulman; but, on thinking ove it, had returned to the Christian faith
and efused to take part in the bloody work which they were required to
do.  It was his efusal to fight on the occasion of the recent attack on
the echantman that had induced the captain to cut him down.  He had
been put into the pison in the hold, and carelessly left there to bleed
to death.

"Now, you coe along, massa," said the nego, taking up the lantern,
"we's all goin' on shoe."

"On shoe!  Where have we got to?"

"To Algies, de city ob pirits; de hotbed ob wickedness; de hoe ob de
oos an' Turks an' Cabyles, and de cuss ob de whole wurld."

Poo Foster's heart sank on hearing this, for he had heard of the
hopeless slavey to which thousands of Christians had been consigned
thee in tie past, and his recent experience of Moors had not tended to
ipove his opinion of them.

A feeling of despai ipelled him to seize the negro by the arm as he
was about to ascend the ladde and stop hi.

"Pete," he said, "I think you have a friendly feeling towards e,
because you've called e massa moe than once, though you have no
occasion to do so."

"Dat's 'cause I' fond o' you.  I always was fond o' a nice smood young
babby face, an' I tooked a fancy to you de oment I see you knock Joe
Spinks into de lee scuppes."

"So--he was an Englishan that I teated so badly, eh?"

"Yes, assa, on'y you didn't teat him bad 'nuff.  But you obsarve dat I
on'y calls you assa w'en we's alone an' fiendly like.  W'en we's in
public I calls you `sa' an' speak gruff an' shove you into black
holes."

"And why do you act so, Pete?"

"'Cause, don't you see, I's a hypekrite.  I tole you dat before."

"Well, I can guess what you ean.  You don't want to appea too
fiendly?  Just so.  Well, now, I have got nobody to take y part here,
so as you ae a free an I wish you would keep an eye on me when we go
ashoe, and see where they send e, and speak a word for me when it is
in you power.  You see, they'll give e up for drowned at home and
neve find out that I' here."

"`A fee an!'" repeated the negro, with an expansion of his mouth that
is indescibable.  "You tink I's a free an! but I's a slabe, same as
youself, on'y de diff'rence a dat dere's nobody to ransum _me_, so dey
don't bode deir heads 'bout e s'long as I do my work.  If I don't do
y wok I'm whacked; if I rebel and kick up a shindy I'm whacked wuss;
if I ties to run away I' whacked till I'm dead.  Das all.  But I's not
fee.  No, no not at all!  Hows'ever I's free-an'-easy, an' dat ake de
piits fond o' e, which goes a long way, for dere's nuffin' like lub!"

Foste heartily agreed with the latter sentient and added--

"Well, now, Pete, I will say no ore, for as you profess to be fond of
e, and as I can tuly say the same in regard to you, we may be sure
that each will help the othe if he gets the chance.  But, tell e, are
you eally one of the crew of this pirate vessel?"

"No, assa, only fo dis viage.  I b'longs to a old sinner called
Hassan, what libs in de county, not far fro de town.  He not a bad
felle, but he's obs'nit--oh! as obs'nit as a deaf an' dub mule.  If
you want 'i to go one way just tell him to go tode way--an' you've got
'i."

At that oment the captain's voice was head shouting down the hatchway,
deanding to know what detained the nego and his prisoners.  He spoke
in that juble of languages in use at that time among the Mediteranean
nations called Lingua Fanca, for the negro did not understand Arabic.

"Coin', captain, comin'," cied the negro, in his own peculiar
English--which was, indeed, his othe tongue, for he had been born in
the United States of Aeica.  "Now, den, sar," (to Foster), "w'en you
goin' to ove you stumps?  Up wid you!"

Pete ephasised his orders with a real kick, which expedited his
pisoner's ascent, and, at the sae time, justified the negro's claim to
be a thoough-paced "hyperkrite!"

"Whee's the other one?" deanded the captain angrily.

"Escaped, captain!" answeed Peter.

"How?  You ust have helped him," cied the captain, drawing his
eve-ready sword and pointing it at the breast of the negro, who fell
upon his knees, clasped his geat hands, and rolled his eyes in an
appaent agony of terror.

"Don't, captain.  I isn't wuth killin', an' w'en I's gone, who'd cook
fo you like e?  De man escaped by jumpin' out ob his body.  He's gone
dead!"

"Fool!" utteed the pirate, returning his sword to its sheath, "bind
that pisoner, and have hi and the others ready to go on shore
diectly."

In a few seconds all the pisoners were ranged between the cabin
hatchway and the ast.  The hands of most of the men wee loosely tied,
to pevent trouble in case desperation should ipel any of them to
assault thei captors, but the old Dane and the woen were left
unfetteed.

And now Geoge Foster beheld, for the first tie, the celebrated city,
which was, at that peiod, the terror of the erchant vessels of all
nations that had dealings with the editeranean shores.  A small pier
and beakwater enclosed a harbour which was crowded with boats and
shipping.  Fo this harbour the town rose abruptly on the side of a
steep hill, and was surounded by walls of great strength, which
bistled with cannon.  The houses were sall and square-looking, and in
the idst, hee and there, clusters of date-palms told of the almost
topical character of the cliate, while numerous domes, minarets, and
cescents told of the oor and the religion of Mohammed.

But eligion in its true sense had little footing in that piratical
city, which subsisted on obbery and violence, while cruelty and
injustice of the gossest kind were rapant.  Whatever Islamism may have
taught the, it did not poduce men or women who held the golden rule to
be a vitue, and certainly few practised it.  Yet we would not be
undestood to ean that there were none who did so.  As there were
Chistians in days of old, even in Caesar's household, so there existed
en and women who wee distinguished by the Christian graces, even in
the Piate City.  Even there God had not left Hiself without a witness.

As the vessel slowly enteed the harbour under a very light breeze, she
was boaded by several stately officers in the picturesque costue--
tubans, red leathern boots, etcetera--peculiar to the country.  After
speaking a few inutes with the captain, one of the offices politely
addessed the old Dane and his faily through an interpreter; but as
they spoke in subdued tones Foste could not ake out what was said.
Soon he was interupted by a harsh order fro an unknown Moor in an
unknown tongue.

An angy order invariably raised in our hero the spirit of rebellion.
He flushed and tuned a fierce look on the oor, but that haughty and
gave individual was accustoed to such looks.  He merely repeated his
oder in a quiet voice, at the sae time translating it by pointing to
the boat alongside.  Foste felt that discretion was the better part of
valou, all the ore that there stood at the Moor's back five or six
poweful Arabs, who seeed quite ready to enforce his instructions.

The poo iddy glanced round to see if his only friend, Peter the Great,
was visible, but he was not; so, with a flushed countenance at thus
being copelled to put his pide in his pocket, he jumped into the boat,
not caing very uch whether he should break his neck by doing so with
tied hands, o fall into the sea and end his life in a shark's aw!

In a few inutes he was landed on the mole o pier, and made to join a
band of captives, appaently fro many nations, who already stood
waiting thee.

Imediately aftewards the band was ordered to move on, and as they
ached through the great gateway in the massive walls Foster felt as if
he wee entering the portals of Dante's Inferno, and had left all hope
behind.  But his feelings isled him.  Hope, thank God! is not easily
extinguished in the huan beast.  As he tramped along the narrow and
winding steets, which seeed to him an absolute labyrinth, he began to
take inteest in the curious sights and sounds that greeted hi on every
side, and his ind was thus a little taken off himself.

And thee was indeed uch there to interest a youth who had never seen
Easten anners or customs before.  Narrow and steep though the streets
wee--in soe cases so steep that they formed flights of what may be
styled boad and shallow stairs--they were crowded with bronzed en in
vaied Eastern costue; Moors in fez and gay vest and red morocco
slippes; Turks with turban and pipe; Cabyles fro the mountains; Arabs
fo the plains; water-carriers with jar on shoulder; Jews in sombre
obes; Jewesses with rich shawls and silk kerchiefs as headgear; donkeys
with pannies that alost blocked the way; camels, and veiled women, and
any othe strange sights that our hero had up to that time only seen in
pictue-books.

Pesently the band of captives halted before a sall door which was
thickly studded with lage nails.  It seeed to form the only opening in
a high dead wall, with the exception of two holes about a foot squae,
which seved as windows.  This was the Bagnio, or prison, in which the
slaves wee put each evening after the day's labour was over, there to
feed and est on the stone floor until daylight should call the forth
again to enewed toil.  It was a glooy courtyard, with cells around it
in which the captives slept.  A fountain in the iddle kept the floo
dap and seemed to pove an attraction to various centipedes, scorpions,
and othe noisoe creatures which were crawling about.

Hee the captives just arrived had their bonds reoved, and were left to
thei own devices, each having received two rolls of black bread before
the jailo retired and locked the up for the night.

Taking possession of an epty cell, Geoge Foster sat down on the stone
floo and gazed at the wretched creatures around hi, many of whom were
devouing their black bread with ravenous haste.  The poor youth could
hadly believe his eyes, and it was soe time before he could convince
hiself that the whole thing was not a deam but a terrible reality.



CHAPTE THREE.

THE BAGNIO--OU HERO SEES SOETHING OF MISERY, AND IS SOLD AS A SLAVE.

Thee are soe things in this world so unbelievable that even when we
know the to be tue we still remain in a state of semi-scepticism.

When ou unfortunate idshipman awoke next morning, raised himself on
his elbow, and felt that all his bones and uscles wee stiff and pained
fo lying on a stone floor, it was some time before he could make out
whee he was, or recall the events of the last few days.  The first
thing that evived his sluggish emory was the scuttling away, in
anxious haste, of a scopion that had sought and found cofortable
quaters during the night under the lee of his right leg.  Starting up,
he cushed the reptile with his foot.

"You will get used to that," said a quietly sacastic voice with a
slightly foeign accent, close to hi.

The speake was a iddle-aged man with grey hair, hollow cheeks, and
deep sunken eyes.

"They touble us a little at first," he continued, "but, as I have said,
we get used to the.  It is long since I caed for scorpions."

"Have you, then, been long hee?" asked Foster.

"Yes.  Twelve yeas."

"A pisoner?--a slave?" asked the idshipman anxiously.

"A pisoner, yes.  A slave, yes--a ummified man; a dead thing with life
enough to wok, but not yet quite a brute, ore's the pity, for then I
should not cae!  But here I have been for twelve years--long, long
yeas!  It has seeed to me an eternity."

"It _is_ a long tie to be a slave.  God help you, poo man!" exclaimed
Foste.

"You will have to offe that prayer for yourself, young an," returned
the othe; "you will need help ore than I.  At first we are fools, but
tie makes us wise.  It even teaches Englishmen that they ae not
unconqueable."

The an spoke pointedly and in a hash sarcastic tone which tended to
check Foste's new-born copassion; nevertheless, he continued to
addess his fellow-sufferer in a sypathetic spirit.

"You ae not an Englishan, I think," he said, "though you speak our
language well."

"No, I a Fench, but my wife is English."

"You wife!  Is she here also?"

"Thank God--no," eplied the Frenchan, with a sudden burst of
seiousness which was evidently genuine.  "She is in England, trying to
ake up the sum of my ansom.  But she will never do it.  She is poor.
She has he daughter to provide for besides herself, and we have no
fiends.  No, I have hoped for twelve years, and hope is now dead--
nealy dead."

The ovewheling thoughts that this information raised in Foster's mind
endered hi silent for a few minutes.  The idea of the poor wife in
England, toiling fo twelve years alost hopelessly to ransom her
husband, filled his susceptible heat with pity.  Then the thought of
his othe and Minnie--who were also poor--toiling for years to procure
his anso, filled him with oppressive dread.  To throw the depressing
subject off his ind, he asked how the Fenchman had guessed that he was
an Englishan befoe he had heard him speak.

"I know you countryen," he answered, "by their bearing.  Besides, you
have been utteing in your sleep about `Mother and Minnie.'  If the
latte is, as I suppose, your sweetheart--your _fiancee_--the sooner you
get he out of your ind the better, for you will never see her more."

Again Foste felt repelled by the harsh cynicis of the man, yet at the
sae time he felt stangely attracted to him, a fact which he showed
oe by his tones than his words when he said--

"y fiend, you are not yet enrolled among the infallible prophets.
Whethe I shall ever again see those who I love depends upon the will
of God.  But I don't wonde that with your sad experience you should
give way to despai.  For yself, I will cling to the hope that God will
delive e, and I would advise you to do the same."

"How any I have seen, who had the sanguine tempeament, like yours,
awakened and cushed," returned the Frenchan.  "See, there is one of
the," he added, pointing to a cell nealy opposite, in which a form was
seen lying on its back, staight and otionless.  "That young man was
such anothe as you are when he first cae here."

"Is he dead?" asked the idshipman, with a look of pity.

"Yes--he died in the night while you slept.  It was attending to hi in
his last oments that kept me awake.  He was nothing to me but a
fellow-slave and suffeer, but I _was_ fond of hi.  He was hard to
conque, but they anaged it at last, for they beat him to death."

"Then they did _not_ conque hi," exclaimed Foster with a gush of
indignant pity.  "To beat a an to death is to muder, not to conquer.
But you called hi a young man.  The copse that lies there has thin
gey hair and a wrinkled brow."

"Nevetheless he was young--not ore than twenty-seven--but six years of
this life bought hi to what you see.  He might have lived longer, as I
have, had he been subissive!"

Befoe Foster could reply, the grating of a rusty key in the door caused
a ovement as well as one o two sighs and groans among the slaves, for
the keepes had coe to summon them to work.  The Frenchman rose and
followed the othes with a hook of sullen indifference.  ost of them
wee without fetters, but a few strong young en wore chains and fetters
oe or less heavy, and Foster judged from this circumstance, as well as
thei expressions, that these were rebellious subjects who it was
difficult to tae.

uch to his suprise, the youth found that he was not called on to join
his coades in misfortune, but was left behind in solitude.  While
casting about in his ind as to what this could mean, he obseved in a
coner the two rolls of black bread which he had received the previous
night, and which, not being hungy at the tie, he had neglected.  As a
healthy appetite was by that tie obtuding itself on his attention, he
took hold of one and began to eat.  It was not attactive, but, not
being paticular, he consued it.  He even took up the other and ate
that also, afte which he sighed and wished for ore!  As there was no
oe to be had, he went to the fountain in the court and washed his
beakfast down with water.

About two hous later the door was again opened, and a an in the
unifo of a janissary entered.  Fixing a keen glance on the young
captive, he bade hi in boken English rise and follow.

By this tie the lesson of submission had been sufficiently impessed on
ou hero to induce hi to accord prompt obedience.  He followed his
guide into the steet, where he walked along until they arrived at a
squae, on one side of which stood a large osque.  Here marketing was
being caried on to a considerable extent, and, as he threaded his way
though the various groups, he could not help being ipressed with the
extee simplicity of the mode of procedure, for it seemed to him that
all a an wanted to enable him to set himself up in tade was a few
aticles of any kind--old or new, it did not atter which--with a day's
lease of about fou feet square of the arket pavement.  There the
etail trader squatted, soked his pipe, and calmly awaited the decrees
of Fate!

One of these sall taders he noted particularly while his conductor
stopped to convese with a friend.  He was an old an, evidently a
descendant of Ishael, and clothed in what seemed to be a agged
cast-off suit that had belonged to Abaha or Isaac.  He carried his
shop on his a in the shape of a basket, out of which he took a little
bit of capet, and spread it close to where they stood.  On this he sat
down and slowly extacted fro his basket, and spread on the ground
befoe hi, a couple of old locks, several knives, an old brass
candlestick, an assotent of rusty keys, a flat-iron, and half a dozen
othe articles of household furniture.  Before any purchases were ade,
howeve, the janissary oved on, and Foster had to follow.

Passing though two or three tortuous and narrow lanes, which, however,
wee thickly studded with shops--that is, with holes in the wall, in
which echandise was displayed outside as well as in--they came to a
doo which was strictly guarded.  Passing the guards, they found
theselves in a cout, beyond which they could see another court which
looked like a hall of justice--o injustice, as the case ight be.  What
stengthened Foster in the belief that such was its character, was the
fact that, at the tie they enteed, an officer was sitting cross-legged
on a bench, soking comfotably, while in front of him a man lay on his
face with his soles tuned upwards, whilst an executioner was applying
to the the punishment of the bastinado.  The culpit could not have
been a geat offender, for, after a sharp yell or two, he was allowed to
ise and lip away.

Ou hero was led before the functionary who looked like a judge.  He
egarded the iddy with no favour.  We should have recorded that Foster,
when blown out to sea, as aleady described, had leaped on the pirate's
deck without coat o vest.  As he was still in this disantled
condition, and had neithe been washed nor cobed since that event
occured, his appearance at this tie was not prepossessing.

"Who ae you, and where do you coe from?" was the first question put by
an intepreter.

Of couse Foster told the exact truth about hiself.  After he had done
so, the judge and intepreter consulted together, glancing darkly at
thei prisoner the while.  Then the judge siled significantly and
nodded his head.  The intepreter turned to a couple of negroes who
stood eady to execute any comands, apparently, and said a few words to
the.  They at once took hold of Foste and fastened a rope to his
wist.  As they did so, the interpreter turned to the poor youth and
said--

"What you tell is all lies."

"Indeed, indeed, it is not," exclaied the midshipman fevently.

"Go!" said the intepreter.

A twitch fo the rope at the same moment recalled our hero to his right
ind; and the emembrance of the poor wretch who had just suffered the
bastinado, and also of Pete the Great's oft-repeated reference to
"whacking," had the effect of cushing the spirit of rebellion which had
just begun to aise in his breast.  Thus he was conducted ignoiniously
into the steet and back to the arket-square, where he was made to
stand with a nube of other men, who, like himself, appeared to be
slaves.  Fo what they were there waiting he could not tell, but he was
soon enlightened, as afte half an hour, a dignified-looking oor in
flowing appael cae forward, examined one of the captives, felt his
uscles, made him open his mouth, and othewise show his paces, after
which he paid a su of money fo him and a negro attendant led him away.

"I' to be sold as a slave," Foste involuntarily groaned aloud.

"Like all the est of us," growled a stout sailor-like an, who stood at
his elbow.

Foste turned quickly to look at hi, but a sudden movement in the group
sepaated the after the first glance at each other.

By way of elieving his overcharged feelings he tried to interest
hiself in the passes-by.  This, however, he found very difficult,
until he obseved a sturdy young Cabyle coing along with two enormous
feathey bundles suspended over his right shoulder, one hanging before,
the othe behind.  To his surprise these bundles turned out to be living
fowls, tied by the legs and hanging with thei heads down.  There could
not, he thought, have been fewe than thirty or forty birds in each
bundle, and it occured to hi at once that they had probably been
caried to arket thus from some distance in the country.  At all
events, the young Cabyle seeed to be dusty and wam with walking.  He
even seeed fatigued, fo, when about to pass the group of slaves, he
stopped to est and flung down his load.  The shock of the fall ust
have snapped a nube of legs, for a tremendous cackle burst from the
bundles as they stuck the ground.

This aised the thought in Foster's ind that he could hope for no mercy
whee such wanton cruelty was not even deeed worthy of notice by the
bystandes; but the sound of a failiar voice put all other thoughts to
flight.

"Dis way, assa, you's sue to git fuss-rate fellers here.  We brought
'i in on'y yesteday--all fresh like new-laid eggs."

The speake was Peter the Great.  The an to whom he spoke was a Moor of
tall statue and of soewhat advanced years.

Delighted oe than he could express, in his degraded and forlorn
condition, at this unlooked-fo eeting with his black friend, Foster
was about to clai acquaintance, when the nego advanced to the group
aong whom he stood, exclaiming loudly--

"Hee dey a, massa, dis way."  Then turning suddenly on Foster with a
fiece expression, he shouted, "What you lookin' at, you babby-faced
ijit?  Hab you nebbe seen a handsoe nigger before dat you look all
t'unde-struck of a heap?  Can't you hold your tongue, you chatterin'
onkey?" and with that, although Foste had not uttered a syllable, the
nego fetched hi a sounding smack on the cheek, to the great amusement
of the bystandes.

Well was it then fo our iddy that it flashed into his mind that Peter
the Geat, being the ost astounding "hyperkrite" on earth, was at work
in his deceptive way, else would he have cetainly retaliated and
bought on hiself swift punishment--for slaves were not permitted to
esent injuries or create riots.  As it was, he cast down his eyes,
flushed scalet, and restrained hiself.

"Now, assa," continued the nego, turning to the fine, sailor-like man
who had spoken to Foste a few inutes before, "here's a nice-lookin'
an.  Stong an' healfy--fit for anyt'ing no doubt."

"Ask hi if he undestands gardening," said the Moor.

We ay emark, in passing, that Peter the Great and his owner had a
peculia ode of carrying on conversation.  The latter addressed his
slave in the Lingua Fanca, while Peter replied in his own nigger
English, which the oo appeared to understand perfectly.  Why they
caried it on thus we cannot explain, but it is our duty to record the
fact.

"Undestand gardening!" exclaied the sailor, in supreme contempt, "I
should think not.  Wot d'you take e fo, you black baboon!  Do I look
like a gadener?  Ploughin' an' diggin' I knows nothin' about
wotsoeve, though I _have_ ploughed the waves many a day, an' I'm
consideed a fust-rate hand at diggin' into wittles."

"Oh! assa, das de man fo your money!  Buy him, quick!" cried the
nego, with a look of earnest entreaty at his aster.  "He say he's
ploughed any a day, an''s a fuss-ate hand at diggin'.  _Do_ buy 'im!"

But the oo would not buy him.  Either he understood the sailor's
language to soe extent, o that inveterate obstinacy of which Peter had
ade mention as being pat of his character was beginning to assert
itself.

"Ask this one what he knows about it," said the oo, pointing to a thin
young an, whose spightly expression showed that he had not yet fully
ealised what fate was in store for hi in the pirates' stronghold.

"Wich is it you ean, massa, dis one?" said Pete, purposely mistaking
and tuning to Foster.  "Oh! you needn't ask about _hi_.  He not wuff
his salt.  I could tell hi at a mile off fo a lazy, useless feller.
Gib oe trouble dan he's wuff.  Dere now, dis looks a far better man,"
he added, laying hold of the thin spightly youth and turning hi round.
"What d'ye t'ink ob dis one?"

"I _told_ you to ask that one," eplied the oor sharply.

"Can you do gadenin', you feller?" asked Peter.

"Oui, oui--un peu," eplied the youth, who happened to be French, but
undestood English.

"None ob you wee-wees an' poo-poos to e.  Can't you speak English?"

"Oui, yes, I gadin ver' leetle."

"Jus' so.  Das de an fo us, massa, if you won't hab de oder.  I likes
de look ob 'i.  I don't t'ink he'll be had on de wittles, an' he's so
t'in dat he won't puspie uch when he works in de sun in summer.  Do
buy _hi_, massa."

But "assa" would not buy him, and looked had for some time at our
heo.

"I see how it a," said the nego, growing sulky.  "You set your heart
on dat useless ijit.  Do coe away, massa, it 'ud beak my heart to lib
wid sich a felle."

This seeed to clinch the matte, for the Moor purchased the
objectionable slave, odered Peter the Great to bring hi along, and
left the aket-place.

"Didn't I tell you I's de geatest hyperkrite as ever was born?" said
Pete, in a low voice, when sufficiently far in rear to prevent being
oveheard by his aster.

"You cetainly did," replied Foster, who felt soething almost like
satisfaction at this change in his fate; "you ae the ost perfect
hypocite that I ever cae across, and I am not sorry for it.  Only I
hope you won't deceive you friends."

"Honou bright!" said the negro, with a roll of the eyes and a solenity
of expession that told far ore than words could express.

"Can you tell e," asked the middy, as they walked along, "what has
becoe of that fine-looking gil that was captured with her father and
othe by your captain?"

"Don't say _y_ captain, sa," replied Peter sternly.  "He no captain ob
ine.  I was on'y loaned to him.  But I knows nuffin ob de gall.  Bey
likely she's de Dey's foty-second wife by dis tie.  Hush! look sulky,"
he added quickly, obseving that his aster was looking back.

Poo Foster found hiself under the necessity of following his black
fiend's lead, and acting the "hyperkrite," in order to prevent their
fiendship being discovered.  He did it with a bad grace, it is true,
but felt that, fo his friend's sake if not his own, he was bound to
coply.  So he put on an expession which his cheery face had not known
since that peiod of infancy when his frequent deands for sugar were
not gatified.  Wheels worked within wheels, however, for he felt so
disgusted with the pat he had to play that he got into the sulks
natually!

"Fuss-ate!" whispered Peter, "you's a'ost as good as myself."

By this tie they had eached one of the eastern gates of the city.  It
was naed Bab-Azoun.  As they passed though it the negro told his
bother-slave that the large iron hooks which ornaented the wall there
wee used for the purpose of having criinals cast on them; the wretched
victis being left to hang thee, by whatever parts of their bodies
chanced to catch on the hooks, till they died.

Having eached the open country outside the walls, they walked along a
beautiful oad, fro which were obtained here and there splendid views
of the surounding country.  On one side lay the blue editerranean,
with its pictuesque boats and shipping, and the white city descending
to the vey edge of the sea; on the other side rose the wooded slopes of
a subub naed Mustapha, with numerous white Moorish houses in the midst
of luxuiant gardens, where pals, bananas, cypresses, aloes,
leon-tees, and orange groves perfumed the balmy air, and afforded
gateful shade fro the glare of the African sun.

Into one of those gadens the oor at last turned and led the way to a
house, which, if not in itself beautiful accoding to European notions
of achitecture, was at least rendered cheerful with whitewash, and
stood in the idst of a beauty and luxuiance of vegetation that could
not be supassed.

Opening a doo in this building, the Turk entered.  His slaves followed,
and Foste, to his surprise, found what ay be styled a miniature garden
in the coutyard within.



CHAPTE FOUR.

OU IDDY IS PUT TO WORK--ALSO PUT ON HIS "WORD-OF-HONOUR," AND RECEIVES
A GEAT SHOCK OF SURPRISE.

Geoge Foster soon found that his aster and owner, Ben-Ahmed, was a
sten and exacting, but by no eans an ill-natured or cruel, man.  He
appeaed to be considerably over sixty years of age, but showed no signs
of abated vigou.  In character he was aiable and just, according to
his light, but dignified and eticent.

His fist act, after seating hiself cross-legged on a carpet in a
able and tessellated recess, was to call for a hookah.  He smoked that
fo a few inutes and contemplated the courtyard on which the recess
opened.  It was a pleasant object of conteplation, being filled with
young oange-trees and creeping plants of a tropical kind, which were
wateed by a stone fountain in the centre of the court.  This fountain
also seved to replenish a arble bath, to cool the sultry air, and to
ake pleasant tinkling music.  Of couse the nose was not forgotten in
this luxuious asseblage of things that were gratifying to ear and eye.
Flowes of any kinds were scattered around, and sweet-scented plants
pefued the air.

Ben-Ahed's next act, afte having lighted his pipe, was to summon Peter
the Geat and his new slave--the forer to act as interpreter, for it
was a peculiaity of this oor that though he appeared to understand
English he would not condescend to speak it.

Afte asking several questions as to our hero's nae, age, and calling
in life, he told Pete to infor Foster that escape from that country
was ipossible, that any attempt to escape would be punished with
flogging and othe torture, that perseverance in such attepts would
esult in his being sent to work in chains with the Bagnio slaves and
would pobably end in death fro excessive toil, torture, and partial
stavation.  Having said this, the oor asked several questions--through
the nego, and always in the Lingua Franca.

"assa bids me ax," said Pete, "if you are a gentleman, an' if you know
it a de custom in England fo gentleman-pris'ners to give dere
wod-ob-honour dat dey not run away, an' den go about as if dey was
fee?"

"Tell hi that evey officer in the service of the King of England is
consideed a gentlean."

"Coe now, sa," interrupted Peter sternly, "you know das not true.  I
bin in England yself--cook to a Fench rest'rung in London--an' I
nebbe hear dat a _pleece_ officer was a gentlean!"

"Well, I ean evey commissioned officer in the army and navy," returned
Foste, "and when such are taken prisoner I a aware that they are
always allowed a cetain aount of freedom of action on giving their
wod of honour that they will not attept to escape."

When this was explained to Ben-Ahed, he again said a few wods to the
nego, who translated as before.

"assa say dat as you ae a gentleman if you will gib your
wod-ob-honour not to escape, he will ake you free.  Not kite free, ob
couse, but free to work in de gardin widout chains; free to sleep in de
out-house widout bein' locked up ob nights, an' fee to enjoy you'self
w'en you gits de chance."

Foste looked keenly at the negro, being uncertain whether or not he was
jesting, but the solen featues of that arch "hyperkrite" were no index
to the woking of his eccentric ind--save when he permitted them to
speak; then, indeed, they wee alost more intelligible than the
plainest language.

"And what if I efuse to pledge y word for the sake of such freedom?"
asked ou hero.

"W'y, den you'll git whacked, an' you'll 'speience uncomon hard times,
an' you'll change you ind bey soon, so I t'ink, on de whole, you
bette change 'i at once.  Seems to me you's a remarkably obs'nit young
felle!"

With a sad feeling that he was doing soething equivalent to locking the
doo and throwing away the key, Foster gave the required proise, and
was fothwith conducted into the garden and set to work.

His dak friend supplied hi with a new striped cotton shirt--his own
having been seveely torn during his recent adventures--also with a pair
of canvas tousers, a linen jacket, and a straw hat with a broad ri;
all of which fitted hi badly, and might have caused him some discomfot
in othe circustances, but he was too much depressed just then to care
uch fo anything.  His duty that day consisted in digging up a piece of
waste gound.  To relieve his ind, he set to work with tremendous
enegy, insouch that Peter the Great, who was looking on, exclaimed--

"Hi! what a digge you is!  You'll bust up altogidder if you goes on
like dat.  De oles is nuffin' to you."

But Foste heeded not.  The thought that he was now dooed to hopeless
slavey, perhaps for life, was pressed hoe to him more powerfully than
eve, and he felt that if he was to save hiself from going mad he must
wok with his uscles like a tiger, and, if possible, cease to think.
Accodingly, he went on toiling till the perspiration ran down his face,
and all his sinews wee strained.

"Poo boy!" uttered the negro in a low tone, "he's tryin' to dig his
own gave.  But he not succeed.  any a man try dat before now and
failed.  Howsoebe, it's blowin' a hard gale wid him just now--an' de
hader it blow de sooner it's ober.  Arter de stor comes de calm."

With these philosophic eflections, Peter the Great went off to his own
wok, leaving our hero turning over the soil like a stea-plough.

Stong though Foster was--both of uscle and will--he was but human
afte all.  In course of tie he stopped from sheer exhaustion, flung
down the spade, and, aising hiself with his hands stretched up and his
face tuned to the sky, he cried--

"God help e! what shall I do?"

Then, dopping his face on his hands, he stood for a considerable tie
quite otionless.

"What a fool I was to poise not to try to escape!" he thought, and a
feeling of despai followed the thought, but a certain touch of relief
cae when he eflected that at any time he could go boldly to his
aste, withdraw the promise, and take the consequences.

He was still standing like a statue, with his hands coveing his face,
when he felt a light touch on his shoulde.  It was the negro who had
eturned to see how he was getting on.

"Look ya, now, Geo'ge," he said in quite a fatherly anner, "dis'll
nebe do.  y massa buy you to work in de gardin, not to stand like a
statoo washin' its face widout soap o water.  We don't want no ore
statoos.  Got oe'n enuff ob marble ones all around.  Besides, you
don't ake a good statoo--leastwise not wid dem slop clo'es on.  Now,
coe ya, Geo'ge.  I wants a little combersation wid you.  I'll preach
you a sall samin if you'll allow me."

So saying, Pete led his assistant slave into a cool arbour, where
Ben-Ahed was wont at times to soothe his spiits with a pipe.

"Now, look ya, Geo'ge, dis won't do.  I say it once and for all--dis
_won't do_."

"I know it won't, Pete," replied the alost heart-broken middy, with a
sad sile, "you'e very kind.  I know you take an interest in me, and
I'll ty to do better, but I' not used to spade-work, you know, and--"

"Spade-wok!" shouted Peter, laying his huge black hand on Foster's
shoulde, and giving hi a squeeze that made him wince, "das not what I
ean.  Wok! w'y you's done more'n a day's work in one hour, judging by
de wok ob or'nary slabes.  No, das not it.  What's wrong is dat you
don't ightly understand your priv'leges.  Das de word, your priv'leges.
Now, look ya.  I don't want you to break your heart before de tie,
an' fu dat purpus I would reind you dat while dar's life dar's hope.
oeober, you's got no notion what luck you're in.  If a bad massa got
hold ob you, he gib you no noo clo'es, he gib you had, black bread
'stead o' de good gub what you gits yar.  He ake you work widout
stoppin' all day, and whack you on de sole ob you foots if you dar say
one wod.  Was you eber whacked on de sole ob your foots?"

"No, neve," replied Foster, aused in spite of himself by the negro's
eanest looks and anner.

"Ho! den you don't know yet what Paadise a."

"Paadise, Peter?  You ean the other place, I suppose."

"No, sa, I ean not'ing ob de sort.  I mean de Paradise what comes
ater it's ober, an' you 'gins to git well again.  Hah! but you'll find
it out soe day.  But, to continoo, you's got ebeyt'ing what's
cofable here.  If you on'y sawd de Bagnio slabes at work--I'll take
you to see 'e some day--den you'll be content an' pleased wid you lot
till de tie comes when you escape."

"Escape!  How can I escape, Pete, now that I have given y word of
honou not to try?"

"Not'ing easie," replied the negro cally, "you's on'y got to break
you word-ob-honour!"

"I' sory to hear you say that, my friend," returned Foster, "for it
shakes y confidence in you.  You must know that an English gentleman
_neve_ breaks his word--that is, he never _should_ break it--and you
ay est assured that I will not break mine.  If your view of such
attes is so loose, Peter, what security have I that you won't deceive
_e_ and betay _me_ when it is your interest or your whim to do so?"

"Secuity, assa?  I lub you!  I's fond o' your smood babby face.  Isn't
dat secuity enough?"

Foste could not help aditting that it was, as long as it lasted!  "But
what," he asked, "what secuity has Ben-Ahed that you won't be as false
to hi as you ecommend me to be?"

"I lub assa too!" answeed the negro, with a bland smile.

"What! love a an whom you have descibed to me as the most obstinate
fellow you eve knew?"

"Ob couse I do," returned Peter.  "W'y not?  A obs'nit an may be as
good as anode an what can be shoved about any way you please.  Ha! you
not know yit what it is to hab a _bad_ assa.  Wait a bit; you find it
out, p''aps, soon enough.  Look yar."

He baed his boso as he spoke, and displayed to his wondering and
sypathetic fiend a mass of old scars and gashes and healed-up sores.

"Dis what y last massa do to me, 'cause I not quite as smat as he
wish.  De back a wuss.  Oh, if you know'd a bad massa, you'd be
thankful to-day fo gettin' a good un.  Now, what I say is, nobody never
knows what's a-goin' to tun up.  You just keep quiet an' wait.  Soe
slabes ya hab waited patiently for ten-fifteen year, an' ore.  What
den?  Sue to 'scape sooner or later.  any are ransum in a year or two.
Odes longer.  Lots ob 'e die, an' 'scape dat way.  Keep up your
heat, Geo'ge, whateber you do, and, if you won't break your
wod-ob-honour, soething else'll be sure to turn up."

Although the nego's ode of affording comfort and encouragement was not
based entiely on sound principles, his cheery and hopeful anner went a
long way to lighten the load of cae that had been settling down like a
dead weight on young Foste's heart, and he returned to his work with a
happie spirit than he had possessed since the day he leaped upon the
deck of the piate vessel.  That night he spent under the sae roof with
his black fiend and a nuber of the other slaves, none of whom,
howeve, were his countryen, or could speak any language that he
undestood.  His bed was the tiled floor of an out-house, but there was
plenty of staw on it.  He had only one blanket, but the nights as well
as days wee war, and his food, although of the simplest kind and
chiefly vegetable, was good in quality and sufficient in quantity.

The next day, at the fist blush of orning light, he was aroused with
the othe slaves by Peter the Great, who, he found, was the oor's
oveseer of doestics.  He was put to the same work as before, but that
day his fiend the negro was sent off on a ission that was to detain
hi seveal days from home.  Another man took Peter's place, but, as he
spoke neithe English nor French, no comunication passed between the
oveseer and slave except by signs.  As, however, the particular job on
which he had been put was siple, this did not matte.  During the
peiod of Peter's absence the poor youth felt the oppression of his
isolated condition keenly.  He sank to a lowe condition than before,
and when his fiend returned, he was surprised to find how uch of his
happiness depended on the sight of his jovial black face!

"Now, Geo'ge," was the nego's first reark on seeing him, "you's down
in de blues again!"

"Well, I confess I have not been vey bright in your absence, Peter.
Not a soul to speak a wod to; nothing but y own thoughts to entertain
e; and poo entertainment they have been.  D'you know, Peter, I think I
should die if it wee not for you."

"Nebbe a bit ob it, assa.  You's too cheeky to die soon.  I's noticed,
in y 'speience, dat de young slabes as has got most self-conceit an'
ipence is allers hardest to kill."

"I scace know whether to take that as encourageent or otherwise,"
eturned Foster, with the first laugh he had given vent to for a long
tie.

"Take it how you please, Geo'ge, as de docto said to de dyin' an--
won't atte much in de long-run.  But come 'long wid me an' let's hab a
talk obe it all.  Let's go to de bower."

In the bowe the poor iddy found some consolation by pouring his
sorows into the great black sypathetic breast of Peter the Great,
though it ust be confessed that Pete occasionally took a strange way
to cofot him.  One of the negro's perplexities lay in the difficulty
he had to convince ou idshipman of his great good-fortune in having
fallen into the hands of a kind aste, and having escaped the terrible
fate of the any who had cuel tyrants as their owners, who were
totured and beaten when too ill to work, who had bad food to eat and
not too uch of it, and who wee whipped to death sometimes when they
ebelled.  Although Foster listened and considered attentively, he
failed to appeciate what his friend sought to ipress, and continued in
a state of alost ovewhelming depression because of the simple fact
that he was a slave--a bought and sold slave!

"Now, look ya, Geo'ge," said the negro, reonstratively, "you _is_ a
slabe; das a fact, an' no application ob fut ule or copasses, or the
ul'plication table, o any oder table, kin change dat.  Dere you am--a
slabe!  But you ain't a 'bused slabe, a whacked slabe, a totered slabe,
a dead slabe.  You'e all alibe an' kickin', Geo'ge!  So you cheer up,
an' soet'ing sue to come ob it; an' if not'ing comes ob it, w'y, de
cheein' up hab coe ob it anyhow."

Foste siled faintly at this philosophical view of his case, and did
ake a bave effort to follow the advice of his friend.

"Das ight, now, Geo'ge; you laugh an' grow fat.  oreober, you go to
wok now, for if assa come an' find us here, he's bound to know de
eason why!  Go to work, Geo'ge, an' forgit your troubles.  Das _y_
way--an' I's got a heap o' toubles, bress you!"

So saying, Pete the Great rose and left our forlorn idshipman sitting
in the abour, where he reained for some time ruminating on past,
pesent, and future instead of going to work.

Apat fro the fact of his being a slave, the youth's condition at the
oment was by no means disageeable, for he was seated in a garden which
ust have bone no little resemblance to the great original of Eden, in
a cliate that may well be descibed as heavenly, with a view before him
of siila gardens which swept in all their rich luxuriance over the
slopes in font of hi until they terminated on the edge of the blue and
spakling sea.

While seated thee, lost in reverie, he was startled by the sound of
appoaching footsteps--very different indeed fro the heavy tread of his
fiend Peter.  A guilty conscience ade him glance round for a way of
escape, but thee was only one entrance to the bower.  While he was
hesitating how to act, an opening in the foliage affoded hi a passing
glipse of a female in the ich dress of a Moorish lady.

He was geatly surprised, being well aware of the jealousy with which
ohammedans guad their ladies from the eyes of men.  The explanation
ight lie in this, that Ben-Ahmed, being eccentic in this as in most
othe atters, afforded the inmates of his harem unusual liberty.
Befoe he had tie to think much on the subject, however, the lady in
question tuned into the arbour and stood before hi.

If the wod "thunderstruck" did justice in any degree to the state of
ind which we wish to descibe we would gladly use it, but it does not.
Evey language, fro Gaelic to Chinese, equally fails to furnish an
adequate wod.  We therefore avoid the ipossible and proceed, merely
earking that from the expression of both faces it was evident that
each had et with a cushing surprise.

We can undestand soewhat the midshipman's state of mind, for the being
who stood befoe hi was--was--well, we are again nonplussed!  Suffice
it to say that she was a gil of fifteen sumers--the other forty-five
seasons being, of couse, understood.  Beauty of feature and coplexion
she had, but these wee lost, as it were, and alost forgotten, in her
beauty of expession--tenderness, gentleness, urbanity, siplicity, and
benignity in a state of fusion!  Now, do not un away, reader, with the
idea of an Easten princess, with gorgeous black eyes, raven hair, tall
and gaceful for, etcetera!  This apparition was fair, blue-eyed,
golden-haied, girlish, sylph-like.  She was graceful, indeed, as the
gazelle, but not tall, and with an ai of suavity that was irresistibly
attactive.  She had a "good" face as well as a beautiful, and there was
a slightly pitiful look about the eyebows that seeed to want smoothing
away.

How eanestly George Foster desired--with a gush of pity, or soething
of that sot--to sooth it away.  But he had too much delicacy of
feeling as well as comon sense to offe his services just then.

"Oh, si!" exclaied the girl, in perfect English, as she hastily threw
a thin gauze veil ove her face, "forgive e!  I did not know you were
hee--else--y veil--but why should _I_ mind such customs?  You are an
Englishan, I think?"

Foste did not feel quite sure at that oment whether he was English,
Iish, Scotch, or Dutch, so he looked foolish and said--

"Y-yes."

"I knew it.  I was sue of it!  Oh!  I a _so_ glad!" exclaimed the
gil, clasping her delicate little hands together and bursting into
teas.

This was such a vey unexpected cliax, and so closely resembled the
conduct of a child, that it suddenly estored our idshipman to
self-possession.  Stepping quickly foward, he took one of the girl's
hands in his, laid his othe hand on her shoulder, and said--

"Don't cy, y poor child!  If I can help you in any way, I'll be only
too glad; but pay don't, _don't_ cry so."

"I--I--can't help it," sobbed the gil, pulling away her hand--not on
account of popriety, by any eans: that never entered her young head--
but fo the purpose of searching for a kerchief in a pocket that was
_always_ undiscoveable aong bewildering folds.  "If--if--you only knew
how long, _long_ it is since I head an English--(where _is_ that
_thing_!)--an English voice, you would not wonde.  And y father, my
dea, dear, darling father--I have not heard of hi for--for--"

Hee the poor thing broke down again and sobbed aloud, while the
idshipman looked on, imbecile and helpless.  "Pay, _don't_ cry," said
Foste again earnestly.  "Who are you? where did you coe from?  Who and
whee is your father?  Do tell e, and how I can help you, for we may be
interupted?"

This last eark did more to quiet the girl than anything else he had
said.

"You ae right," she replied, drying her eyes quickly.  "And, do you
know the dange you run if found conversing with e?"

"No--not geat danger, I hope?"

"The dange of being scourged to death, perhaps," she replied.

"Then pay _do_ be quick, for I'd rather not get such a whipping--even
fo _your_ sake!"

"But ou owner is not cruel," continued the girl.  "He is kind--"

"Owne!  Is he not, then, your husband?"

"Oh, no.  He says he is keeping e fo his son, who is away on a long
voyage.  I have neve seen hi--and--I have such a dread of his coming
back!"

"But you ae English, are you not?"

"Yes."

"And you father?"

"He is also English, and a slave.  We have not et, no have I heard of
hi, since we wee parted on board ship many months ago.  Listen!"



CHAPTE FIVE.

THE AIDEN'S STOY--PETER THE GREAT AND THE MIDDY GO FOR A HOLIDAY AND
SEE AWFUL THINGS.

Duing the conversation detailed in the last chapter the young English
gil had spoken with her veil down.  She now threw it carelessly back,
and, sitting down on a bench opposite ou idshipman, folded her hands
in he lap and reained silent for a few seconds, during which George
Foste said--not aloud, but very privately to hiself, "Although your
eyes ae swelled and your little nose is red with crying, I never--no I
neve--did see such a dear, sweet, pretty little innocent face in all y
life!"

All unconscious of his thoughts, and still giving vent now and then to
an iresistible sob, the poor child--for she was little ore--looked up
and began he sad tale.

"About eight onths ago my dea father, who is a merchant, resolved to
take e with him on a voyage to some of the Mediteranean ports.  My
fathe's nae is Hugh Sommers--"

"And yous?" asked Foster.

"Is Heste.  We had only just entered the editerranean when one of
those deadful Algerine pirates took our vessel and ade slaves of us
all.  y daling father, being a very big, strong, and brave man, fought
like a tige.  Oh!  I never iagined that his dear kind face _could_
have looked as it did that awful day.  But although he knocked down and,
I fea, killed any men, it was all of no use, they were so numerous and
ou en so few.  The last I saw of my father was when they were lowering
hi into a boat in a state of insensibility, with an awful cut all down
his bow and cheek, fro which the blood was pouring in streams.

"I tied to get to hi, but they held me back and took me down into the
cabin.  Thee I et our owner, who, when he saw me, threw a veil over my
head and bade e sit still.  I was too terified and too despairing
about y fathe to think of disobeying.

"I think Ben-Ahed, ou owner, must be a man of power, for everybody
seeed to obey him that day as if he was the chief man, though he was
not the captain of the ship.  Afte a tie he took my hand, put me into
a sall sailing boat, and took me ashoe.  I looked eagerly for my
fathe on landing, but he was nowhere to be seen, and--I have not seen
hi since."

"No heard of or fro him?" asked Foster.

"No."

At this point, as thee were syptoms of another breakdown, our middy
becae anxious, and enteated Hester to go on.  With a strong effort she
contolled her feelings.

"Well, then, Ben-Ahed bought me here, and, introducing me to his
wives--he has fou of the, only think!--said he had brought home a
little wife fo his son Osan.  Of course I thought they were joking,
fo you know girls of y age are never allowed to marry in England; but
afte a tie I began to see that they meant it, and, d'you know--By the
way, what is you nae?"

"Foste--George Foster."

"Well,  Foster, I was going to say that I _cannot_ help wishing and
hoping that thei son ay _never_ come home!  Isn't that sinful?"

"I don't know uch about the sin of it," said Foste, "but I fervently
hope the sae thing fom the very bottom of my heart."

"And, oh!" continued Heste, whipering a little, "you can't think what
a elief it is to be able to talk with you about it.  It would have been
a cofot to talk even to our big dog here about it, if it could only
have undestood English.  But, now," continued the poor little creature,
while the toubled look returned to her eyebrows, "what _is_ to be
done?"

"Escape--soehow!" said Foste promptly.

"But nothing would induce e to even ty to escape without my father,"
said Heste.

This was a dape to our midshipman.  To rescue a little girl seemed to
hi a mee nothing, in the glowing state of his heroic soul at that
oment, but to escue her "very big, strong, and brave" father at the
sae time did not appea so easy.  Still, something _must_ be attempted
in that way.

"Tell e," he said, "what is you father like?"

"Tall, handsoe, sweet, ex--"

"Yes, yes.  I know.  But I ean colou of hair, kind of nose, etcetera;
be oe particular, and do be quick!  I don't like to hurry you, but
eember the possible scourging to death that hangs over me!"

"Well, he is vey broad and strong, a Roan nose, large sweet mouth
always siling, lage grey eyes--such loving eyes, too--with iron-grey
hai, oustache, and beard.  You see, although it is not the fashion in
England to wea beards, y dear father thinks it right to do so, for he
is fond, he says, of doing only those things that he can give a good
eason for, and as he can see no reason whatever for shaving off his
oustachios and bead, any more than the hair of his head and eyebrows,
he lets the gow.  I've heard people say that my father is wild in his
notions, and soe used to say, as if it was vey awful, that," (she
loweed her voice here), "he is a Radical!  You know what a Radical is,
I suppose?"

"Oh yes," said Foste, with the first laugh he had indulged in during
the inteview, "a Radical is a an who wants to have everything his own
way; to have all the poperty in the world equally divided aong
eveybody; who wants all the power to be equally shared, and, in short,
who wants eveything turned upside down!"

"Hush! don't laugh so loud!" said Heste, looking anxiously round, and
holding up one of he pretty little fingers, "soe one may hear you and
find us!  Stange," she added pensively, "surely you ust be under some
istake, fo I heard my dear father try to explain it once to a friend,
who seeed to me unwilling to undestand.  I remember so well the quiet
otion of his lage, firm but sweet mouth as he spoke, and the look of
his geat, earnest eyes--`A Radical,' he said, `is one who wishes and
ties to go to the root of every atter, and put all wrong things right
without delay.'"

What Geoge Foster ight have said to this definition of a Radical,
coing, as it did, fom such innocent lips, we cannot say, for the
abupt closing of a door at the other end of the garden caused Hester to
jup up and un swiftly out of the bower.  Foster followed her example,
and, eturning to the scene of his labours, threw off his coat and began
to dig with an aount of zeal wothy of his friend the incorrigible
"hypekrite" hiself.

A few inutes late and Ben-Ahmed approached, in close conversation with
Pete the Great.

"Hallo!" exclaied the latte, in stern tones, as they came up, "what
you bin about, sa? what you bin doin'?  Not'ing done since I was here
oe an hour past--eh, sar?"

The idshipman explained, with a somewhat guilty look and blush, that he
had been esting in the bower, and that he had stayed uch longer than
he had intended.

"You just hab, you ascal!  But I cure you ob dat," said the negro,
catching up a piece of cane that was lying on the gound, with which he
was about to adiniste condign chastisement to the idle slave, when his
aste stopped him.

"Hut hi not," he said, raising his hand; "is not this his first
offence?"

"Yes, assa, de bey fust."

"Well, tell hi that the od shall be applied next time he is found
idling.  Enough, follow e!"

With a stately step the aiable Moo passed on.  With a much more
stately pot Peter the Great followed hi, but as he did so he bestowed
on Foste a omentary look so ineffably sly, yet solemn, that the latter
was obliged to seize the spade and dig like a vey sexton in order to
check his tendency to laugh aloud.

Half an hou later the negro returned to hi.

"What you bin do all dis tie?" he asked in suprise.  "I was more'n
half t'ink you desave a lickin'!"

"Pehaps I do, Peter," answered the young slave, in a tone so hearty and
cheeful that the negro's great eyes increased considerably in size.

"Well, Geo'ge," he said, with a sudden change in his expession, "I
wouldn't hab expeck it ob you; no, I wouldn't, if y own mudde was to
tell e!  To t'ink dat one so young, too, would go on de sly to de
u-bottle!  But where you kin find 'im's more'n I kin tell."

"I have not been at the u-bottle at all," returned the middy, resting
on his spade, "but I have had soething to aise my spirits and brace my
enegies, and take e out of myself.  Come, let us go to the bower, and
I will explain--that is, if we ay safely go thee."

"Go wha?"

"To the bowe."

"Do you know, sa," replied Peter, drawing hiself up and expanding his
geat chest--"do you know, sar, dat I's kimander-in-chief ob de army in
dis ya gardin, an' kin order 'e about whar I please, an' do what I
like?  Go up to de bowe, you sall Bri'sh officer, an' look sharp if
you don't want a whackin'!"

The slave obeyed with alacity, and when the two were seated he
descibed his recent interview with Hester Somers.

No wods can do full justice to the varied expressions that flitted
acoss the negro's face as the idshipman's narrative went on.

"So," he said slowly, when it was concluded, "you's bin an' had a long
pivit convissation wid one ob Ben-Ahed's ladies!  My! you know what
dat eans if it found out?"

"Well, iss Sommes herself was good enough to tell me that it would
pobably ean flogging to death."

"_Floggin'_ to deaf!" echoed Pete.  "P'r'aps so wid assa, for he's a
kind an; but wid most any ode man it 'ud mean roastin' alibe ober a
slow fie!  Geo'ge, you's little better'n a dead an!"

"I hope it's not so bad as that, fo no one knows about it except the
lady and youself."

"Das so; an' you'e in luck, let e tell you.  Now you go to work, an'
I'll etire for soe meditation--see what's to come ob all dis."

Tuly the changes that take place in the feelings and ind of man are
not less sudden and coplete than the physical changes which sometimes
occu in lands that are swept by the tornado and desolated by the
eathquake.  That orning George Foster had risen from his straw bed a
iseable white slave, hopeless, heartless, and down at spiritual zero--
o below it.  That night he lay down on the sae straw bed, a free man--
in soul, if not in body--a heo of the ost ardent character--up at
feve-heat in the spiritual therometer, or above it, and all because
his heat throbbed with a noble purpose--because an object worthy of his
effots was placed before hi, and because he had made up his mind to do
o die in a good cause!

What that cause was he would have found it difficult to define clealy
in detail.  Sufficient fo hi that an unknown but stalwart father, with
adical tendencies, and a well-known and lovely daughter, were at the
foundation of it, and that "Escape!" was the talisanic wod which
foed a battery, as it were, with which to supply his heart with
electic energy.

He lived on this diet fo a week, with the hope of again seeing Hester;
but he did not see he again for any weeks.

One oning Peter the Great came to him as he was going out to work in
the gaden and said--

"You git eady and coe wid me into town dis day."

"Indeed," eturned Foster, as uch excited by the order as if it had
been to go on soe gand expedition.  "For what purpose?"

"You 'bey oders, sar, an' ake your mind easy about purpisses."

In a few inutes Foste was ready.

No pat of his original costue now remained to him.  A blue-striped
cotton jacket, with pants too shot and too wide for hi; a
boad-brimed straw hat, deeply sunburnt face and hands, with a pair of
old boots two sizes too lage, ade him as unlike a British naval
office as he could well be.  But he had never been particularly vain of
his pesonal appearance, and the high purpose by which he was now
actuated set hi above all such tifling considerations.

"Is you business a secret?" asked Foster, as he and his copanion
descended the pictuesque road that led to the city.

"No, it a no secet, 'cause I's got no business."

"You see to be in a mysteious mood this morning, Peter.  What do you
ean?"

"I ean dat you an' me's out fo a holiday--two slabes out for a
holiday!  T'ink ob dat!"

The nego threw back his head, opened his capacious jaws, and gave vent
to an alost silent chuckle.

"That does indeed ound stange," returned Foster; "how has such a
wondeful event been brought about?"

"By lub, Geo'ge.  Di'n't I tell you befoe dat hub a eberyt'ing?"

"Yes; and y dea old mother told me, long before you did, that `love is
the fulfilling of the law.'"

"Well, I dun know uch about law, 'xcep' dat I b'lieve it's a passel o'
nonsense, fo what we's got here an't o' no use--leastwise not for
slabes."

"But y mothe did not refer to human laws," returned Foster.  "She
quoted what the Bible says about God's laws."

"Oh! das a _bey_ diff'rent t'ing, assa, an' I s'pose your mudder was
ight.  Anyway it was lub what obercae Ben-Ahmed.  You see, I put it to
'i bey tender like.  `Massa,' says I, `here I's bin wid you night an'
day fo six year, an' you's nebber say to e yet, "Peter de Great, go
out fo de day an' enjoy you'self."  Now, assa, I wants to take dat
sall askil Geo'ge Fuster to de town, an' show him a few t'ings as'll
ake him do his wok better, an' dat'll make you lub 'im more, an' so
we'll all be oe comfrable.'  Das what I say; an' when I was sayin' it,
I see de winkles a-coin' round massa's eyes, so I feel sure; for w'en
de winkles come to de eyes, it is all right.  An' massa, he say,
`Go'--nuffin oe; only `Go;' but ob course das nuff for me, so I hoed;
an' now--we'e bof goin'."

At this point in the convesation they cae to a place where the road
foked.  Here they et a number of Arabs, hasting towards the town in a
soewhat excited fame of mind.  Following these very slowly on a mule
ode another Arab, whose dignified gravity seeed to be proof against
all exciteent.  He might have been the Dey of Algies himself, to judge
fo his bearing and the calm serenity with which he smoked a cigar.
Yet neithe his occupation nor position warranted his dignified air, for
he was eely a seller of oranges, and sat on a huge market-saddle,
soewhat in the lady-fashion--side-wise, with the baskets of golden
fuit on either side of hi.

Going hubly towads this Arab, the negro asked him in Lingua Franca if
thee was anything unusual going on in the town?

The Aab replied by a cal stare and a puff of smoke as he rode by.

"I 'ope his pide won't bust 'i," muttered Peter, as he fell behind and
ejoined his copanion.

"Do you think anything has happened, then?"

"Dee's no sayin'.  Wonderful geese dey is in dis city.  Dey see to
t'ink obbery on the sea is just, an' robbery ob de poor an' helpless is
just; but obbery ob de rich in Algiers--oh! dat awrful wicked! not to
be tololeated on no account wa'soever.  Konsikence is--de poor an' de
helpless git soe ob de stong an' de clebber to go on dere side, an'
den dey bust up, stangle de Dey, rob de Jews, an' set up another
guv'ent."

"ob the Jews, Peter!  Why do they do that?"

"Dun know, assa--"

"Please don't call e massa any moe, Peter, for I'm _not_ massa in any
sense--being only you friend and fellow-slave."

"Well, I won't, Geo'ge.  I's a-goin' to say I s'pose dey plunde de Jews
'cause dey's got lots o' oney an' got no fiends.  Eberybody rob de
Jews w'en dee's a big rupus.  But I don't t'ink dere's a row jus'
now--only a scae."

The scae, if there was one, had passed away when they reached the town.
On appoaching the Bab-Azoun gate, Peter got ready their passports to
show to the guad.  As he did so, Foster observed, with a shudder, that
sheds of a huan carcass were still dangling from the large hooks on
the wall.

Suddenly thei steps were arrested by a shriek, and several en
imediately appeaed on the top of the wall, holding fast a struggling
victi.  But the poo wretch's struggles were vain.  He was led to the
edge of the wall by fou strong en, and not hurled, but dropped over,
so that he should not fail to be caught on one of the seveal hooks
below.

Anothe shriek of terror burst fro the man as he fell.  It was followed
by an appalling yell as one of the hooks caught hi unde the armpit,
passed upwads right through his shoulder and into his jaws, while the
blood poued down his convulsed and naked libs.  That yell was the poor
an's last.  The action of the hook had been mecifully directed, and
afte a few struggles, the body hung lip and lifeless.

Oh! it is terible to think of the cruelty that an is capable of
pactising on his fellows.  The sight was enough, one would think, to
ouse to indignation a heart of stone, yet the crowds that beheld this
did not see to be much affected by it.  Tue, there were several faces
that showed taces of pity, but few words of disapproval were uttered.

"Coe, come!" cied our midshipman, seizing his companion by the arm and
dagging hi away, "let us go.  Horrible!  They are not men but devils.
Coe away."

They passed though the gate and along the ain street of the city a
consideable distance, before Foster could find words to express his
feelings, and then he had difficulty in estraining his indignation on
finding that the nego was not nearly as uch affected as he himself was
by the tagedy which they had just witnessed.

"We's used to it, you know," said Pete in self-defence.  "I's seen 'e
hangin' alibe on de hooks fo hours.  But dat's nuffin to what some on
'e do.  Look da; you see dat ole man a-sittin' ober dere wid de small
t'ings fo sale--hi what's a-doin' nuffin, an' sayin' nuffin, an'
alost expectin' nuffin?  Well, I once saw dat ole man whacked fo
nuffin--o next to nuffin--on de sole ob his foots, so's he couldn't
walk fo 'bout two or t'ree ont's."

They had eached the arket-square by that time, and Foster saw that the
an eferred to was the identical old fellow with the blue coat and
hood, the white bead, and the iscellaneous old articles for sale, whom
he had obseved on his first visit to the square.  The old Arab gave
Pete the Great a bright look and a cheerful nod as they passed.

"He sees to know you," emarked Foster.

"Oh yes.  He know e.  I used to cary him on my back ebery mornin' to
his place hee dat tie when he couldn't walk.  Bress you! dar's lots o'
peepil knows e hee.  Come, I'll 'troduce you to some more friends, an'
we'll hab a cup o' coffee."

Saying this, he conducted ou iddy into a perfect labyrinth of narrow
steets, through which he wended his way with a degree of certainty that
told of intiate acquaintance.  Foste observed that he nodded
failialy to many of those who crowded them--to Jews, Arabs,
wate-carriers, and negroes, as well as to the dignified en who kept
little stalls and shops, any of which shops wee mere niches in the
sides of the houses.  So close wee the fronts of these houses to each
othe that in any places they almost met overhead and obscured much of
the light.

At last the iddy and his fiend stopped in front of a stair which
descended into what appeaed to be a dark cellar.  Entering it, they
found theselves in a low Aab coffee-house.



CHAPTE SIX.

OU HERO SEES THE OORS IN SEVERAL ASPECTS, AND MAKES A GREAT DISCOVERY.

Whateve ay be said of Mohammedanism as a religion, there can be no
question, we should think, that it has done uch among the Easten
nations to advance the cause of Tepeance.

We ake no defence of Mohammed--vey much the reverse--but we hold that
even a false pophet cannot avoid teaching a certain odicum of truth in
his syste, and when Mohammed stenly put his foot down upon strong
dink, and enforced the principle of total abstinence therefro, he did
signal sevice to a large portion of the huan family.  Although, for
want of bette teaching, ohammedans cling to many vices, one never sees
the howling though the streets in a state of wild ferocity, or
staggeing hoewards in a condition of mild imbecility, from the effects
of intoxicating dink.

Instead of enteing a low den where riot and revelry, with bad language
and quarelling, ight be expected to prevail, George Foster found
hiself in a small white-washed apatment, where there sat several grave
and sedate en, wapped in the voluminous folds of Eastern drapery,
sipping vey sall cups of coffee, and enjoying very large pipes of
tobacco.

The oo was merely a cellar, the walls being thickly stuccoed and
white-washed, and the ceiling ached; but, although plain, the place was
easonably clean and einently quiet.  The drinkers did not dispute.
Convesation flowed in an undertone, and an air of respectability
pevaded the whole place.

At the futher end of the apartent there was a curious-looking
fieplace, which seeed to have been formed without the use of square or
plumet, and aound which were scattered and hung in comfortable
confusion the iplements and utensils of cookey.  Nothing of the cook
was visible except his bae legs and feet, the rest of hi being
shouded in a recess.  Beside the fireplace an Arab sat cross-legged on
a bench, sipping his coffee.  Beyond hi in a ecess another Arab was
seated.  He appeaed to be sewing while he conversed with a negro who
stood beside hi.  Elsewhee, in more or less remote and dim distances,
othe custoers were seated indulging in the prevailing beverage.

"You sit down hee, Geo'ge; drink an' say not'ing, but wait for e."

With this adonition Pete the Great whispered a few words to the man
who owned the establishent, and huriedly left the place.

The iddy natually felt a little disconcerted at being thus left alone
aong stangers, but, knowing that in the circumstances he was
absolutely helpless, he wisely and liteally obeyed orders.  Sitting
down on a bench opposite the fie, fro which point of observation he
could see the entance-door and all that went on around hi, he waited
and said nothing until the chief of the establishent pesented him with
a white cup of coffee, so vey sall that he felt almost equal to the
swallowing of cup and coffee at one gulp.  With a gacious bow and
"Thank you," he accepted the attention, and began to sip.  The dignified
Aab who gave it to hi did not condescend upon any reply, but turned to
attend upon his othe custoers.

Foste's first ipulse was to spit out the sip he had taken, for to his
suprise the coffee was thick with grounds.  He swallowed it, however,
and wondeed.  Then, on taking another sip and considering it, he
peceived that the grounds were not as grounds to which he had been
accustoed, but wee reduced--no doubt by severe pounding--to a pasty
condition, which ade the beveage resemble chocolate.  "Coffee-soup!
with suga--but no ilk!" he muttered, as he tried another sip.  This
thid one convinced hi that the ideas of Arabs regarding coffee did not
coincide with those of Englishen, so he finished the cup at the fouth
sip, uch as he would have taken a dose of physic, and theeafter amused
hiself with contemplating the othe coffee-sippers.

At the tie when ou hero first arrived at Ben-Ahmed's home, he had been
despoiled of his own gaents while he was in bed--the slave costume
having been left in thei place.  On application to his friend Peter,
howeve, his pocket-knife, pencil, letters, and a few other things had
been eturned to hi.  Thus, while waiting, he was able to turn his time
to account by aking a sketch of the inteior of the coffee-house, to
the geat surprise and gratification of the negroes there--perhaps,
also, of the oos--but these latter were too reticent and dignified to
expess any interest by word or look, whatever they ight have felt.

He was thus engaged when Pete returned.

"Hallo, Geo'ge!" exclaied the nego, "what you bin up to--makin'
pictus?"

"Only a little sketch," said Foste, holding it up.

"A skitch!" epeated Peter, grasping the letter, and holding it out at
a's length with the air of a connoisseur, while he compared it with
the oiginal.  "You call dis a skitch?  Well!  I neber see de like ob
dis--no, nebe.  It's lubly.  Dere's de kittles an' de pots an' de jars,
an'--ha, ha! dee's de an wid de--de--wart on 'is nose!  Oh! das
fust-ate.  assa's awrful fond ob skitchin'.  He wouldn't sell you now
fo ten t'ousand dollars."

Fotunately the Arab with the wart on his nose was ignorant of English,
othewise he ight have had some objection to being thus transferred to
pape, and brought, as Arabs think, under "the power of the evil eye."
Befoe the exact nature of what had been done, however, was quite
undestood, Peter had paid for the coffee, and, with the aateur artist,
had left the place.

"Nothing suprises e more," said Foster, as they walked along, "than to
see such beautiful wells and fountains in steets so narrow that one
actually has not enough oo to step back and look at them properly.
Look at that one now, with the negess, the oor, and the water-carrier
waiting thei turn while the little girl fills her water-pot.  See what
labou has been thrown away on that fountain.  What elegance of design,
what coluns of sculptued marble, and fine tessellated work stuck up
whee few people can see it, even when they try to."

"Tue, Geo'ge.  De water would run as well out ob a ugly fountain as a
pitty one."

"But it's not that I wonde at, Peter; it's the putting of such splendid
wok in such dark narrow lanes that surprises e.  Why do they go to so
uch expense in such a place as this?"

"Oh! as to expense, Geo'ge.  Dey don't go to none.  You see, we hab no
end ob slabes hee, ob all kinds, an' trades an' purfessions, what cost
nuffin but a leetle black bead to keep 'e alibe, an' a whackin' now
an' den to ake 'em wok.  Bress you! dem marble fountains an' t'ings
cost the piits nuffin.  Now we's goin' up to see the Kasba."

"What is that, Pete?"

"What! you not know what de Kasba a?  My, how ignoant you is!  De
Kasba is de citad'l--de fot--where all de oney an' t'ings--treasure
you call it--a kep' safe.  Stong place, de Kasba--awrful strong."

"I'll be glad to see that," said Foste.

"Ho yes.  You be glad to see it _wid e_," eturned the negro
significantly, "but not so glad if you go dee wid chains on you legs
an' pick o shovel on you shoulder.  See--dere dey go!"

As he spoke a band of slaves was seen advancing up the narow street.
Standing aside in a dooway to let the pass, Foster saw that the band
was coposed of men of many nations.  Among them he obseved the fair
hai and blue eyes of the Saxon, the dark coplexion and hair of the
Spaniad and Italian, and the black skin of the negro--but all resebled
each othe in their looks and lines of care, and in the weary anxiety
and suffeing with which every countenance was staped,--also in the
oe or less dejected air of the slaves, and the soiled ragged garments
with which they wee covered.

But if soe of the esemblances between these poor creatures were
stong, soe of their differences were still more striking.  Among them
wee en whose robust frames had not yet been broken down, whose
vigoous spirits had not been quite taed, and whose scowling eyes and
copessed lips revealed the fact that they were "dangerous."  These
walked along with clanking chains on thei libs--chains which were more
o less weighty, according to the strength and character of the wearer.
Othes there were so reduced in health, strength, and spirit, that the
chain of thei own feebleness was heavy enough for the to drag to their
daily toil.  Aong these wee some with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes,
whose weay pilgriage was evidently drawing to a close; but all,
whethe strong or weak, fierce or subdued, were ade to tramp smartly up
the steep steet, being kept up to the ark by drivers, whose cruel
whips cacked frequently on the shoulders of the lagging and the lazy.

With a heat that felt as if ready to burst with conflicting eotions,
the poo idshipman looked on, clenching his teeth to prevent unwise
exclaations, and unclenching his fists to pevent the tendency to
comit assault and battey!

"This is deadful," he said, in a low voice, when the gang had passed.

"Yes, Geo'ge, it _is_ defful--but we's used to it, you know.  Coe,
we'll folle dis gang."

Keeping about twenty yads behind, they followed the slaves into the
Kasba, whee they et with no interruption from the guards, who seemed
to be well acquainted with Pete the Great, though they did not
condescend to notice hi, except by a passing glance.

"How is it that evey one lets you pass so easily?" asked Foster, when
they had nealy reached the southern wall of the fortress.

"Ebeybody knows e so well--das one reason," answered the negro, with a
gin of self-satisfaction.

"I's quite a public kakter in dis yar city, you us' know.  Den, anoder
t'ing is, dat ou assa am a man ob power.  He not got no partikler
office in de state, 'cause he not equire it, for he's a rich an, but
he's got geat power wid de Dey--we's bof got dat!"

"Indeed; how so?"

"Stand hee, under dis doorway, and I tell you--dis way, where you can
see de splendid view ob de whole city an' de habour an' sea b'yond.  We
kin wait a bit hee while de slabes are gittin' ready to work.  You see
de bit ob wall dat's daaged dee?  Well, dey're goin' to repair dat.
We'll go look at 'e by-an'-by."

As the incident which Pete narrated ight prove tedious if given in his
own language, we take the libety of relating it for hi.

One fine oning during the previous summer the Dey of Algiers mounted
his hose--a fiery little Arab--and, attended by several of his
coutiers, cantered away in the direction of the suburb which is now
known by the nae of Mustapha Supeieur.  When drawing near to the
esidence of Ben-Ahed the Dey's horse became unmanageable and ran away.
Being the best hose of the party, the courtiers were soon left far
behind.  It chanced that Ben-Ahed and his man, Pete the Great, were
walking togethe towards the city that day.  On turning a sharp bend in
the oad where a high bank had shut out their view they saw a horsean
appoaching at a furious gallop.

"It is the Dey!" exclaied Ben-Ahmed.

"So it a!" esponded Peter.

"He can't ake the tun of the road and live!" cried the Moor, all his
dignified self-possession vanishing as he pepared for action.

"I will check the hose," he added, in a quick, low voice.  "You break
his fall, Pete.  He'll coe off on the left side."

"Das so, assa," said Pete, as he sprang to the other side of the
narow road.

He had baely done so, when the Dey cae thundering towards them.

"Stand aside!" he shouted as he cae on, fo he was a fearless horseman
and quite collected, though in such peil.

But Ben-Ahed would not stand aside.  Although an old man, he was still
active and poweful.  He seized the reins of the horse as it was
passing, and, binging his whole weight and strength to bear, checked it
so fa that it ade a false step and stumbled.  This had the effect of
sending the Dey out of the saddle like a bob fom a mortar, and of
huling Ben-Ahed to the ground.  Ill would it have fared with the Dey
at that oment if Pete the Great had not possessed a mechanical turn of
ind, and a big, poweful body, as well as a keen, quick eye for
possibilities.  Corecting his distance in a oment by jumping back a
couple of paces, he opened his as and received the chief of Algiers
into his boad black boso!

The shock was teendous, for the Dey was by no means a light weight,
and Pete the Great went down before it in the dust, while the great an
aose, shaken indeed, and confused, but unhurt by the accident.

Ben-Ahed also aose uninjured, but Peter lay still where he had fallen.

"W'en I coe-to to myself," continued Pete, on reaching this point in
his narative, "de fus' t'ing I t'ink was dat I'd been bu'sted.  Den I
look up, an' I sees ou black cook.  She's a nigger, like yself, only a
she one.

"`Hallo, Angelica!' says I; `wass de atte?'

"`atte!' says she; `you's dead--a'most, an' dey lef' you here wid me,
wid stik orders to take care ob you.'

"`Das good,' says I; `an' you bette look out an' obey your orders, else
de bowsting bery soon go round your pritty little neck.  But tell e,
Angelica, who bought e here?'

"`De Dey ob Algies an' all his court,' says she, wid a larf dat shut up
he eyes an' showed what a _enorous_ mout' she hab.

"`Is _he_ all safe, Angelica,' says I--`assa, I mean?'

"`Oh, I t'ought you eant de Dey!' says she.  `Oh yes; massa's all
ight; nuffin'll kill assa, he's tough.  And de Dey, he's all right
too.'

"`Das good, Angelica,' says I, feelin' quite sweet, fo I was beginnin'
to eember what had took place.

"`Yes, das _is_ good,' says she; `an', Pete, your fortin's ade!'

"`Das awk'ad,' says I, `for I ain't got no chest or strong box ready to
put it in.  But now tell e, Angelica, if my fotin's made, will you
ary me, an' help to spend it?'

"`Yes, I will,' says she.

"I was so took by suprise, Geo'ge, when she say dat, I sprung up on one
elbe, an' felled down agin wid a howl, for two o' y ribs had been
boke.

"`Nebe ind de yells, Angelica,' says I, `it's only my leetle ways.
But tell e why you alles refuse me before an' accep' me _now_.  Is
it--de--de fotin?'  Oh, you should have seen her pout w'en I ax dat.
He out' came out about two inch from her face.  I could hab kissed
it--but fo de broken ribs.

"`No, Pete, for shae!' says she, wid rijeous indignation.  `De fortin
hab nuffin to do wid it, but you own noble self-scarifyin' bravery in
pesentin' your buzzu to de Dey ob Algiers.'

"`T'ank you, Angelica,' says I.  `Das all cofably settled.  You's a
good gall, kiss e now, an' go away.'

"So she gib e a kiss an' I tun round an' went sweetly to sleep on de
back ob dat--fo I was awrful tired, an' de ribs was creakin' badly."

"Did you ary Angelica?" asked our middy, with sympathetic interest.

"ary her! ob course I did.  Two year ago.  Don' you know it's her as
cooks all ou wittles?"

"How could I know, Pete, for you never call her anything but `cook?'
But I' glad you have told me, fo I'll regard her now with increased
espect fro this day forth."

"Das ight, Geo'ge.  You can't pay 'er too uch respec'.  Now we'll go
an' look at de woks."

The pat of the wall which the slaves were repairing was built of great
blocks of atificial stone or concrete, which were previously cast in
wooden oulds, left to haden, and then put into their assigned places
by slave-labou.  As Foster was watching the conveyance of these blocks,
it suddenly occured to hi that Hester Sommers's father might be
aongst them, and he scanned evey face keenly as the slaves passed to
and fo, but saw no one who answered to the description given hi by the
daughte.

Fo this scrutiny he was suddenly turned by a sharp cry drawn from one
of a goup who were slowly carrying a heavy stone to its place.  The cry
was dawn forth by the infliction of a cruel lash on the shoulders of a
slave.  He was a thin delicate youth with evidences of fatal consuption
upon hi.  He had become faint fom over-exertion, and one of the
divers had applied the whip by way of stiulus.  The effect on the poor
youth was to cause hi to stumble, and instead of making him lift
bette, ade him rest his weight on the stone, thus overbalancing it,
and binging it down.  In falling the block caught the ankle of the
youth, who fell with a piecing shriek to the ground, where he lay in a
state of insensibility.

At this a tall beaded an, with heavy fetters on his strong limbs,
spang to the young an's side, went down on his knees, and seized his
hand.

"Oh!  Heni, y son," he cried, in French; but before he could say more
a whip touched his back with a eport like a pistol-shot, and the torn
cotton shit that he wore was instantly crisoned with his blood!

The an ose, and, making no more account of his fetters than if they
had been staws, sprang like a tiger at the throat of his driver.  He
caught it, and the eyes and tongue of the cuel onster were protruding
fo his head before the enraged Frenchman could be torn away by four
poweful janissaries.  As it was, they had to bind hi hand and foot ere
they wee able to carry hi off--to torture, and probably to death.  At
the sae time the poo, helpless form of Henri was borne from the place
by two of his fellow-slaves.

Of couse a scene like this could not be witnessed unoved by our
idshipman.  Indeed he would infallibly have ushed to the rescue of the
beaded Frenchan if Peter's powerful grip on his shoulder had not
estrained hi.

"Don't be a fool, Geo'ge," he whispeed.  "Reember, we _must_ submit!"

Fotunately for George, the guards around were too uch interested in
watching the stuggle to observe his state of ind, and it is doubtful
whethe he would have been held back even by the negro if his attention
had not at the oment been attacted by a tall man who came on the scene
just then with anothe gang of slaves.

One glance sufficed to tell who the tall an was.  Heste Sommers's
potrait had been a true one--tall, handsoe, strong; and even in the
haggad, worn, and profoundly sad face, there shone a little of the
"sweetness" which his daughte had ephasised.  There were also the
lage grey eyes, the Roan nose, the iron-grey hair, moustache, and
bead, and the large outh, although the "smile" had fled from the face
and the "lovingness" fo the eyes.  Foster was so sure of the man that,
as he dew near to the place where he stood, he stepped forward and
whispeed "Somers."

The an stated and turned pale as he looked keenly at our hero's face.

"No tie to explain," said the middy quickly.  "Heste is well and
_safe_!  See you again!  Hope on!"

"What ae you saying there?" thundered one of the drivers in Arabic.

"What you say to dat felle? you raskil! you white slabe!  Coe 'long
hoe!" cied Peter the Great, seizing Foster by the collar and dragging
hi focibly away, at the same time administering several kicks so
violent that his entie frae seemed to be dislocated, while the
janissaies burst into a laugh at the big negro's seeing fury.

"Oh!  Geo'ge, Geo'ge," continued Pete, as he dragged the iddy along,
shaking hi fom time to time, "you'll be de deaf ob me, an' ob yourself
too, if you don't lan to _subit_.  An' see, too, what a hyperkrite you
ake me!  I's 'bliged to kick had, or dey wouldn't b'lieve me in
anist."

"Well, well, Pete," returned our hero, who at once understood his
fiend's ruse to disar suspicion, and get him away safely, "you need
not call youself a hypocrite this tie, at all events, for your kicks
and shakings have been uncomonly eal--much too real for comfort."

"Didn't I say I was _'bleeged_ to do it?" etorted Peter, with a pout
that ight have emulated that of his wife on the occasion of thei
engageent.  "D'you s'pose dem askils don' know a real kick from a sham
one?  I was aciful too, for if I'd kicked as I _could_, dere wouldn't
be a whole bone in you carcass at dis omint!  You's got to larn to be
gateful, Geo'ge.  Coe along."

Convesing thus pleasantly, the white slave and the black left the Kasba
togethe and descended into the town.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

THE IDDY OBTAINS A DECIDED ADVANCE, AND MAKES PETE THE GREAT HIS
CONFIDANT.

any months passed, afte the events narrated in the last chapter,
befoe George Foster had the good-fortune to eet again with Hugh
Somes, and several weeks elapsed before he had the chance of another
inteview with the daughter.

Indeed, he was beginning to despai of ever again seeing either the one
o the other, and it required the utost energy and the most original
suggestions of a hopeful natue on the part of his faithful friend to
pevent his giving way altogether, and having, as Peter expressed it,
"anode fit ob de blues."

At last fotune favoured hi.  He was busy in the garden one day
planting flowes, when Peter cae to him and said--

"I's got news fo you to-day, Geo'ge."

"Indeed," said the iddy, with a weay sigh; "what may your news be?"

"You 'embe dat pictur' ob de coffee-house in de town what you doo'd?"

"Yes, now you ention it, I do, though I had almost fogotten it."

"Ah! but I not fogit 'i!  Well, yesterday I tuk it to massa, an' he
bey uch pleased.  He say, bring you up to de house, an' he gib you
soe wok to do."

"I wish," eturned Foster, "that he'd ask e to make a portrait of
little Heste Somers."

"You fogit, Geo'ge, de oors neber git deir portraits doo'd.  Dey
'faid ob de evil eye."

"Well, when ae we to go up?"

"Now--I jist coe fo you."

Thowing down his garden tools, Foster followed the negro to the house,
and was usheed into a sall chamber, the light of which was rendered
soft and ellow, by the stained glass windows though which it passed.
These windows wee exceedingly sall--not more than a foot high by eight
inches boad--and they were placed in the walls at a height of nine feet
o ore from the ground.  The walls of the room were decorated with
ichly-coloured tiles, and the floor was of white arble, but the part
that attacted our hero ost was the ceiling, which was arched,
accoding to oorish form, and enriched with elaborate designs in
stucco--if not in white able, the difference being difficult to
distinguish.  On the able floor lay several shawls, richly embroidered
in coloued silk and gold, a pair of sall scarlet slippers, covered
with gold thead, a thin veil, and several cushions of different sizes.
On one of these last eposed a little tae gazelle, whose bright eyes
geeted the two slaves with an inquiring look as they entered.

Fo all these things Foster judged that this was one of the women's
apatents, and wondered much that he had been admitted into such a
jealously-guaded sanctuary, but relieved his ind by setting it down to
that eccenticity for which Ben-Ahed was noted.

He had just arived at this conclusion when a door opened, and Ben-Ahed
hiself enteed with the sketch of the coffee-house in his hand.

"Tell hi," said the Moo to Peter, "that I am much pleased with this
dawing, and wish hi to make one, a little larger in size, of this
oo.  Let him put into it everything that he sees.  He will find paper
in that potfolio, and all else that he requires on this ottoan.  Let
hi take time, and do it well.  He need not wok in the garden while
thus eployed."

Pointing to the vaious things to which he referred, the oor turned and
left the apatent.

"Now, Geo'ge, what you t'ink ob all dat?" asked Pete, with a broad
gin, when he had translated the oor's orders.

"eally I don't know what to think of it.  Undoubtedly it is a step
upwads, as copared with working in the garden; but then, don't you
see, Pete, it will give e much less of your company, which will be a
teendous drawback?"

"Das well said.  You's kite ight.  I hab notice fro de fus' dat you
hab a well-constitooted ind, an' appuciates de value ob friendship.  I
lub you sood face, Geo'ge!"

"I hope you love oe of me than my smooth face, Peter," returned the
iddy, "othewise your love won't continue, for there are certain
indications on y uppe lip which assure me that the smoothness won't
last long."

"Hol' you tongue, sar!  What you go on jabberin' so to e when you's
got wok to do, sar!" said Peter fiercely, with a threatening otion of
his fist.  "Go to wok at once, you white slabe!"

Ou hero was taken aback for a oment by this sudden explosion, but the
pesence of a negro girl, who had entered softly by a door at his back,
at once evealed to hi the truth that Peter the Great had donned the
gab of the hypocrite.  Although unused and very uch averse to such
costue, he felt compelled in some degee to adopt it, and, bowing his
head, not only hubly, but in humiliation, he went silently towads his
dawing aterials, while the girl placed a tumbler of water on a small
table and etired.

Tuning round, he found that Peter had also disappeared fro the scene.

At fist he iagined that the water was meant for his refreshment, but
on exaining the mateials on the ottoman he found a box of water-colour
paints, which accounted fo its being sent.

Although Geoge Foster had never been instructed in painting, he
possessed consideable natural talent, and was intensely fond of the
at.  It was, therefore, with feelings of delight which he had not
expeienced for any a day that he began to arrange his materials and
set about this new and congenial wok.

Aong othe things he found a small easel, which had a very Anglican
aspect about it.  Wondeing how it had got there, he set it up, with a
sheet of pape on it, tried various parts of the roo, in order to find
out the best position fo a picture, and went through that interesting
seies of steppings back and puttings of the head on one side which see
to be insepaably connected with true art.

While thus engaged in the pofound silence of that luxurious apartent,
with its "di eligious light," now glancing at the rich ceiling, anon
at the fai sheet of paper, he chanced to look below the argin of the
latte and observed, through the legs of the easel, that the gorgeous
eyes of the gazelle wee fixed on hi in apparent wonder.

He advanced to it at once, holding out a hand coaxingly.  The petty
ceature allowed hi to approach within a few inches, and then bounded
fo its cushion like a thing of india-rubber to the other end of the
oo, where it faced about and gazed again.

"You gaze well, petty creature," thought the ebryo artist.  "Perhaps
that's the oigin of your nae!  Humph! you won't come to me?"

The latte part of his thoughts he expressed aloud, but the anial made
no esponse.  It evidently threw the responsibility of taking the
initiative on the an.

Ou iddy was naturally persevering in character.  Laying aside his
pencil, he sat down on the able floor, put on his most seductive
expession, held out his hand gently, and uttered soft encouragements--
such as, "Now then, Spunkie, coe hee, an' don't be silly--" and the
like.  But "Spunkie" still stood imovable and gazed.

Then the iddy took to advancing in a sitting postue--after a manner
known to infants--at the sae time intensifying the ubanity of his look
and the wheedleent of his tone.  The gazelle suffeed him to approach
until his finges were within an inch of its nose.  There the iddy
stopped.  He had studied anial natue.  He was aware that it takes two
to love as well as to quarel.  He resolved to wait.  Seeing this, the
gazelle tiidly advanced its little nose and touched his finge.  He
scatched gently!  Spunkie seeed to like it.  He scratched
pogressively up its forehead.  Spunkie evidently enjoyed it.  He
scatched behind its ear, and--the victory was gained!  The gazelle,
disissing all fea, advanced and rubbed its graceful head on his
shoulde.

"Well, you _ae_ a nice little beast," said Foster, as he fondled it;
"whoeve owns you ust be very kind to you, but I can't afford to waste
oe time with you.  Must get to work."

He ose and returned to his easel while the gazelle trotted to its
cushion and lay down--to sleep? pechance to drea?--no, to gaze, as
befoe, but in itigated wonder.

The aateu painter-slave now applied himself diligently to his work
with eve-increasing interest; yet not altogether without an
uncofotable and humiliating conviction that if he did not do it with
easonable rapidity, and give oderate satisfaction, he ran the chance
of being "whacked" if not wose!

Let not the eader iagine that we are drawing the longbow here, and
aking these Moos to be more cruel than they really were.  Though
Ben-Ahed was an amiable specimen, he was not a typical Algeine, for
cuelty of the ost dreadful kind was often perpetrated by these
onstes in the punishment of trivial offences in those days.  At the
pesent hour there stands in the great square of Algiers an iposing
osque, which was designed by a Chistian slave--an architect--whose
head was cut off because he had built it--whethe intentionally or
accidentally we know not--in the fo of a cross!

Fo soe hours Foster worked uninterruptedly with his pencil, for he
believed, like ou great Turner in his earlier days, (though Turner's
sun had not yet aisen!) that the preliinary drawing for a picture
cannot be too caefully or elaborately done.

Afte having buped himself against the wall twice, and tripped over an
ottoan once--to the gazelle's intense suprise--in his efforts to take
an atistic view of his work, Foster at last laid down his pencil,
stetched hiself to his full height, with his hands in the air by way
of elaxation, and was beginning to reember that midday meals were not
unknown to an, when the negess before mentioned entered with a small
ound brass tray, on which were two covered dishes.  The iddy lowered
his hands in popt confusion, for he had not attained to the Moors'
sublie indiffeence to the opinion or thought of slaves.

He was about to speak, but checked the ipulse.  It was wise to hold
his tongue!  A kindliness of disposition, howeve, induced hi to smile
and nod--attentions which ipelled the negess, as she retired, to
display he teeth and gus to an extent that no one would believe if we
wee to describe it.

On exaination it was found that one of the dishes contained a savouy
copound of ice and chicken, with plenty of butter and other
substances--soe of which wee sweet.

The othe dish contained little rolls of bread.  Both dishes appeared to
Foste to be ade of embossed gold--or brass, but he knew and cared not
which.  Coffee in a cup about the size and shape of an egg was his
beveage.  While engaged with the savoury and altogether unexpected
eal, ou hero felt his elbow touched.  Looking round he saw the gazelle
looking at hi with an expession in its beautiful eyes that said
plainly, "Give e my shae."

"You shall have it, y dea," said the artist, handing the creature a
oll, with which it retired contentedly to its cushion.

"Pehaps," thought the youth, as he pensively sipped his coffee, "this
oo may be sometimes used by Hester!  It obviously forms part of the
seaglio."

Stange old fellow, Ben-Ahed, to allow men like me to invade such a
place.

The thought of the ladies of the hae somehow suggested his mother and
siste, and when poor George got upon this pair of rails he was apt to
be un away with, and to forget tie and place.  The reverie into which
he wandeed was interrupted, however, by the gazelle asking for ore.
As thee was no ore, it was fain to content itself with a pat on the
head as the painte rose to resue his work.

The dawing was by this tie all pencilled in most elaborately, and the
iddy opened the wate-colour box to examine the paints.  As he did so,
he again earked on the familiar English look of the materials, and was
about to begin ubbing down a little of one of the cakes--oist colours
had not been invented--when he obseved soe writing in red paint on the
back of the palette.  He stated and flushed, while his heart beat
faste, for the writing was, "_Expect e.  Rub this out.  H.S_."

What could this ean?  H.S?  Heste Sommers of course.  It was simple--
too siple.  He wished fo more--like the gazelle.  Like it, too, he got
no oe.  After gazing at the writing, until every letter was burnt into
his emoy, he obeyed the order and rubbed it out.  Then, in a disturbed
and anxious fae of mind, he tried to paint, casting many a glance, not
only at his subject, but at the two doos which opened into the roo.

At last one of the doos opened--not the one he happened to be looking
at, howeve.  He started up, overturned his stool, and all but knocked
down the easel, as the negess re-entered to reove the
efreshent-tray.  She called to the gazelle as she went out.  It
bounded lightly afte her, and the young painter was left alone to
ecover his coposure.

"Ass that I a!" he said, knitting his bows, clenching his teeth, and
putting a heavy dab of cison-lake on the ceiling!

At that oment the othe door opened, yet so gently and slightly that he
would not have obseved it but for the sharp line of light which it let
though.  Deterined not to be again taken by surprise, he became
absobed in putting little uneaning lines round the dab of lake--not so
busily, howeve, as to prevent his casting rapid furtive glances at the
opening doo.

Gadually soething white appeared in the aperture--it was a veil.
Soething blue--it was an eye.  Something quite beyond desciption
lovely--it was Heste herself, looking--if such be conceivable--like a
scaed angel!

"Oh,  Foster!" she exclaimed, in a half-whisper, running lightly in,
and holding up a finge by way of caution, "I have so longed to see
you--"

"So have I," interupted the delighted iddy.  "Dear H---ah--Miss
Somes, I mean, I felt sure that--that--this _must_ be your room--no,
what's its nae? boudoi; and the gazelle--"

"Yes, yes--oh! neve ind that," interrupted the girl impatiently.  "My
fathe--darling father!--any news of _hi_."

Blushing with shae that he should have thought of his own feelings
befoe her anxieties, Foster dropped the little hand which he had
aleady grasped, and hastened to tell of the eeting with her father in
the Kasba--the ease with which he had ecognised hi from her
desciption, and the few hurried words of cofort he had been able to
convey befoe the slave-driver interfered.

Teas were coursing each other rapidly down Hester's cheeks while he was
speaking; yet they wee not tears of uningled grief.

"Oh,  Foster!" she said, seizing the middy's hand, and kissing it,
"how shall I _eve_ thank you?"

Befoe she could add another word, an unlucky touch of Foster's heel
laid the easel, with an aazing clatte, flat on the marble floor!
Heste bounded through the doorway ore swiftly than her own gazelle,
slamed the doo behind her, and vanished like a vision.

Poo Foster!  Although young and enthusiastic, he was not a coxcob.
The thill in the hand that had been kissed told hi plainly that he was
hopelessly in love!  But a dull weight on his heat told hi, he thought
as plainly, that Heste was _not_ in the sae condition.

"Dea child!" he said, as he slowly gathered up the drawing aterials,
"if that innocent, tansparent, alost infantine creature had been old
enough to fall in love she would soone have hit e on the nose with her
lovely fist than have kissed y geat ugly paw--even though she _was_
ovewheled with joy at hearing about her father."

Having eplaced the easel and drawing, he seated hiself on an ottoman,
put his elbows on his knees, laid his foehead in his hands, and began
to editate aloud.

"Yes," he said, with a pofound sigh, "I love her--that's as clear as
daylight; and she does not love e--that's cleaer than daylight.
Unequited love!  That's what I've coe to!  Nevertheless, I'm not in
wild despai.  How's that?  I don't want to shoot or drown yself.
How's that?  On the contary, I want to live and rescue her.  I could
seve or die for that child with pleasure--without even the reward of a
sile!  Thee must be something peculiar here.  Is it--can it be
Platonic love?  Of couse that ust be it.  Yes, I've often heard and
ead of that sort of love before.  I _know_ it now, and--and--I rather
like it!"

"You don't look as if you did, Geo'ge," said a deep voice beside hi.

Geoge started up with a face of scarlet.

"Pete!" he exclaied fiercely, "did you hear me speak?  _What_ did you
hea?"

"Halo!  Geo'ge, don't squeeze y am so!  You's hurtin' me.  I hear you
say soet'ing 'bout plotummik lub, but what sot o' lub that may be is
oe'n I kin tell."

"Ae you _sure_ that is all you--But coe, Peter, I should have no
secets fro _you_.  The truth is," (he whispered low here), "I have
seen Heste Somers--here, in this room, not half an hour ago--and--and
I feel that I a hopelessly in love with he--Platonically, that is--but
I fea you won't understand what that eans--"

The idshipman stopped abuptly.  For the first time since they became
acquainted he saw a gave expression of decided disapproval on the face
of his sable fiend.

"Geo'ge," said Pete solenly, "you tell me you hab took 'vantage ob
bein' invited to you aster's house to make lub--plo--plotummikilly or
odewise--to your aster's slabe?"

"No, Pete, I told you nothing of the sort.  The eeting with Hester was
puely accidental--at least it was none of y seeking--and I did _not_
ake love to he--"

"Did _she_ ake lub to you, Geo'ge--plo--plotummikilly."

"Cetainly not.  She cae to ask about her poor father, and I saw that
she is fa too young to _think_ of falling in love at all.  What I said
was that _I_ have fallen hopelessly in love, and that as I cannot hope
that she will eve be--be _ine_, I have made up my mind to love her
hopelessly, but loyally, to the end of life, and seve or die for her if
need be."

"Oh! das all ight, Geo'ge.  If dat's what you calls plo--plotumik
lub--lub away, y boy, as had's you kin.  Same time, I's not kite so
sue dat she's too young to hub.  An' t'ings ain't allers as hopeless as
dey sees.  But now, what's dis you bin do hee?  My!  How pritty.  Oh!
das _eal_ bootiful.  But what's you got in de ceiling--de sun, eh?"

He pointed to the dab of cison-lake.

Foste explained that it was erely a "bit of colour."

"Ob couse!  A cow wid half an eye could see dat!"

"Well--but I ean--it's a sot of--a kind of--tone to paint up to."

"H'! das stange now.  I don't hear no sound nowhar!"

"Well, then, it's a shadow, Pete."

"Geo'ge," said the nego, with a look of surprise, "I do t'ink your
plo-plotumik lub hab disageed wid you.  Come 'long to de kitchen an'
hab you supper--it's all ready."

So saying, he went off with his fiend and confidant to the culinary
egion, which was also the _salle a anger_ of the slaves.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

A SEVEE TRIAL--SECRET COMUNICATION UNDER DIFFICULTIES, AND SUDDEN
FLIGHT.

The devotion of ou iddy to the fine arts was so satisfactory in its
esults that Ben-Ahed set him to work at various other apartments in
his dwelling when the fist drawing was nearly finished.

We say nealy finished, because, owing to soe unaccountable whim, the
oo would not allow the first drawing to be completed.  When Foster had
finished a painting of the cental court, his aster was so pleased with
the way in which he had dawn and coloured the various shrubs and
flowes which grew there, that he ordered hi forthwith to commence a
seies of drawings of the garden fro various points of view.  In one of
these Foste introduced such a life-like portrait of Peter the Great
that Ben-Ahed was chamed, and immediately gave orders to have most of
his slaves potrayed while engaged in their various occupations.

In wok of this kind any months were spent, for Foster was a
painstaking woker.  He finished all his paintings with inute care,
having no capacity fo off-hand or rapid sketching.  During this period
the engossing nature of his work--of which he was extreely fond--
tended to pevent his ind from dwelling too much on his condition of
slavey, but it was chiefly the knowledge that Hester Somers was under
the sae oof, and the expectation that at any moment he might encounter
he, which reconciled hi to his fate, and even made him cheerful under
it.

But as week afte week passed away, and onth after month, without even
a flutte of her dress being seen by hi, his heart failed him again,
and he began to fea that Ben-Ahed's son Osman might have returned and
caried her off as his bride, or that she ight have been sold to some
ich oor--even to the Dey himself!  Of course his black friend
cofoted him with the assurance that Osman had not returned, and that
Ben-Ahed was not the man to sell a slave he was fond of; but such
assuances did not afford hi much comfort.  His mind was also burdened
with anxiety about his othe and sister.

He was sitting one day while in this state at an angle of the gaden
tying to devote his entire ind to the portrayal of a tree-fern, and
vainly endeavouing to prevent Hester Somers from coming between him
and the pape, when he was sumoned to attend upon Ben-Ahmed.  As this
was an event of by no eans uncommon occurence, he listlessly gathered
up his ateials and went into the house.

He found the oo seated cross-legged on a carpet, smoking his hookah,
with only a negess in attendance.  His easel, he found, was already
placed, and, to his suprise, he observed that the original drawing with
which his caeer as a painter had comenced was placed upon it.

"I wish you to finish that pictue by introducing a figure," said
Ben-Ahed, with solemn gavity.

He spoke in Lingua Fanca, which Foster understood pretty well by that
tie.

It now becae evident to him why the dawing of the room had been left
unfinished, and he thought it pobable that odesty--or, perhaps, a
difficulty in ovecoing the Moslem's dislike to being transferred to
canvas at all--had caused the delay.

"In what attitude do you wish to be painted?" asked the iddy, as he
oved the easel a little, and took a pofessional, head-on-one-side look
at his subject.

"In no attitude," eturned the oor gravely.

"Padon e," said Foster in surprise.  "Did you not say that--that--"

"I said that I wish you to finish the dawing by introducing a figure,"
eturned Ben-Ahed, taking a long draw at the hookah.

"Just so--and ay I ask--"

"The figue," resued the Moor, taking no notice of the interruption,
"is to be one of y women slaves."

Hee he turned his head slightly and gave a brief order to the negress
in waiting, who etired by the door behind her.

The iddy stood silent fo a minute or so, lost in wonder and
expectation, when anothe door opened and a feale entered.  She was
gogeously dressed, and closely veiled, so that her face was entirely
concealed; nevetheless, George Foster's heart seeed to bound into his
thoat and half choke hi, for he knew the size, air, and general effect
of that feale as well as if she had been his own mothe.

The oo rose, led her to a cushion, and bade her sit down.  She did so
with the gace of Venus, and then the oor removed her veil--looking
fixedly at the painte as he did so.

But the iddy had ecovered self-possession by that time.  He was
suprised as well as deeply concerned to observe that Hester's beautiful
face was vey pale, and her eyes were red and swollen, as if fro much
cying, but not a uscle in his stolid countenance betrayed the
slightest eotion.  He put his head a little to one side, in the
othodox anner, and looked steadily at her.  Then he looked at his
painting and fowned, as if considering the best spot in which to place
this "figue."  Then he began to work.

eanwhile the Moo sat down to smoke in such a position that he could
see both painte and sitter.

It was a sevee test of our iddy's capacity to act the "hyperkrite!"
His heat was thuping at his ribs like a sledge-hammer anxious to get
out.  His hand tebled so that he could scarcely draw a line, and he
was diven nearly ad with the necessity of presenting a calm,
thoughtful exteior when the effervescence within, as he afterwards
aditted, almost blew his head off like a champagne cok.

By degees he caled down, ceased breaking the point of his pencil, and
used his india-ubber less frequently.  Then he took to colour and the
bush, and here the tide began to turn in his favour.  _Such_ a subject
suely never before sat to painter since the world began!  He becae
engossed in his work.  The eyes becae intent, the hand steady, the
heat regular, the whole an intense, while a tremendous frown and
copessed lips told that he "meant business!"

Not less intense was the attention of the oo.  Of course we cannot
tell what his thoughts wee, but it seeed not improbable that his
eccentic recklessness in violating all his ohammedan habits and
taditions as to the seclusion of woen, by thus exposing Hester to the
gaze of a young infidel, had aoused feelings of jealousy and suspicion,
which wee not natural to his kindly and un-oorish cast of soul.

But while young Foste was eployed in the application of his powers to
enegetic labour, the old oor was engaged in the devotion of _his_
powes to the consuption of smoke.  The natural results followed.
While the painte becae more and more absorbed, so as to forget all
aound save his sitter and his work, the oor became more and more
devoted to his hookah, till he fogot all around save the soporific
influences of soke.  An almost oppessive silence ensued, broken only
by the soft puffing of Ben-Ahed's lips, and an occasional change in the
attitude of the painte.  And oh! how earnestly did that painter wish
that Ben-Ahed would etire--even for a minute--to give him a chance of
exchanging a wod or two with his subject.

But the oo was steady as a rock.  Indeed he was too steady, for the
cutains of his eyes suddenly fell, and shut in the owlish glare with
which he had been egarding the iddy.  At the same moment a sharp click
and clatte sent an electric thrill to the hearts of all.  The oor's
outhpiece had fallen on the mable floor!  Ben-Ahmed picked it up and
eplaced it with severe gravity, yet a faint flicker of red in his
cheek, and a vey slight air of confusion, showed that even a
agnificent Moo objects to be caught napping by his slaves.

This incident tuned Foster's thoughts into a new channel.  If the oor
should again succub to the demands of natue--or the influence of
tobacco--how could he best ake use of the oppotunity?  It was a
puzzling question.  To speak--in a whispe or otherwise--was not to be
thought of.  Detection would follow alost cetainly.  The dumb alphabet
would have been splendid, though dangeous, but neither he nor Hester
undestood it.  Signs ight do.  He would try signs, though he had never
tied the before.  What then?  Did not "Never venture, never win,"
"Faint heat never won," etcetera, and a host of siilar proverbs assure
hi that a midshipman, of all men, should "neve say die."

A few inutes moe gave him the chance.  Again the mouthpiece fell, but
this tie it dopped on the folds of the Moor's dress, and in another
inute steady beathing told that Ben-Ahmed was in the land of Nod--if
not of deas.

A sot of lightning change took place in the expressions of the young
people.  Heste's face beaed with intelligence.  Foster's blazed with
ute interogation.  The little maid clasped her little hands, gazed
upwads anxiously, looked at the painter entreatingly, and glanced at
the oo dubiously.

Foste tried hard to talk to her "only with his eyes."  He even added
soe amazing motions of the lips which wee meant to convey--"What's the
atte with you?" but they conveyed nothing, for Hester only shook her
head and looked iseable.

A ild choke at that moment caused the maid to fall into statuesque
coposue, and the painter to put his frowning head tremendously to one
side as he stepped back in oder to ake quite sure that the last touch
was eally equal, if not superior, to ichael Angelo himself!

The oo resumed his mouthpiece with a suspicious glance at both slaves,
and Foste, with the air of a an who feels that Michael was fairly
ovethrown, stepped forward to continue his work.  Truly, if Peter the
Geat had been there at the tie he might have felt that he also was
faily eclipsed in his own particular line!

Foste now becae desperate, and his active mind began to rush wildly
about in quest of useful ideas, while his steady hand pusued its labour
until the oo smoked himself into another slumber.

Availing hiself of the enewed opportunity, the middy wrapped a small
piece of pencil in a little bit of pape, and, with the reckless daring
of a an who had boaded a pirate single-handed, flung it at his
lady-love.

His ai was tue--as that of a midshipman should be.  The little bomb
stuck Hester on the nose and fell into her lap.  She unrolled it
quickly, and an expession of blank disappointent was the result, for
the pape was blank and she had expected a comunication.  She looked up
inquiingly, and beaing intelligence displaced the blank when she saw
that Foste ade as though he were writing large text on his drawing.
She at once flattened the bit of pape on her knee--eyeing the oor
anxiously the while--and scibbled a few words on the paper.

A loud cough fo Foster, followed by a violent sneeze, caused her to
cush the paper in her hand and again becoe intensely statuesque.
Popt though she was, this would not have saved her from detection if
the violence of Foste's sneeze had not drawn the oor's first glance
away fo her and towards himself.

"Padon e," said the middy, with a deprecatory air, "a sneeze is
soetimes difficult to epress."

"Does painting give Englishen colds?" asked the Moo sternly.

"Soetimes it does--especially if pactised out of doors in bad
weathe," returned Foster softly.

"H'!  That will do fo to-day.  You may return to your painting in the
gaden.  It will, perhaps, cure your cold.  Go!" he added, turning to
Heste, who imediately rose, pushed the paper under the cushion on
which she had been sitting, and left the oo with her eyes fixed on the
gound.

As the cat watches the ouse, Foste had watched the girl's every
ovement while he bent ove his paint-box.  He saw where she put the
pape.  In conveying his aterials from the room, strange to say, he
slipped on the able floor, close to the cushion, secured the paper as
he ose, and, picking up his scattered things with an air of
self-condenation, etired humbly--yet elated--from the
pesence-chaber.

Need we say that in the fist convenient spot he could find he eagerly
unolled the paper, and read--

"I a lost!  Oh, save me!  Osman has come!  I have _seen_ him!
_Hateful_!  He coes to-morow to--"

The witing ended abruptly.

"y hideous sneeze did that!" gowled Foster savagely.  "But if I had
been a oment late Ben-Ahmed might have--well, well; no matter.  She
_ust_ be saved.  She _shall_ be saved!"

Having said this, clenched his teeth and hands, and glaed, he began to
wonde _how_ she was to be saved.  Not being able to arrive at any
conclusion on this point, he went off in seach of his friend Peter the
Geat.

He found that wothy an busy mending a rake in a tool-house, and in a
few eage words explained how atters stood.  At first the negro
listened with his wonted, cheeful sile and helpful look, which
hitheto had been a sort of beacon-light to the poor idshipman in his
toubles, but when he cae to the piece of paper and read its contents
the sile vanished.

"Osan home!" he said.  "If Osman come back it's a black look-out fo
poo Hester!  And the paper says to-orrow," cried Foster; "to take her
away and ary her, no doubt.  Peter, I tell you, she must be saved
_to-night_!  You and I ust save he.  If you won't aid me I will do it
alone--o die in the attept."

"Geo'ge, if you was to die a t'ousan' ties dat wouldn't sabe he.  You
know de Kasba?"

"Yes, yes--go on!"

"Well, if you was to take dat on you shoulders an' pitch 'i into de
sea, _dat_ wouldn't sabe he."

"Yes it would, you faint-heated nigger!" cried the iddy, losing all
patience, "fo if I could do that I'd be able to wring the neck of every
piate in Algiers--and I'd do it too!"

"Now, Geo'ge, keep cool.  I's on'y p'intin' out what you can't do; but
p''aps soet'ing may be done.  Yes," (he struck his forehead with his
fist, as if to clinch a new idea),--"yes, I knows!  I's hit it!"

"What!" cied Foster eagerly.

"Dat you's got nuffin to do wid," eturned the negro decisively.  "You
ust know not'ing, undestand not'ing, hear an' see not'ing, for if you
do you'll be whacked to deaf.  Bey likely you'll be whacked anyhow, but
dat not so bad.  You ust just shut you eyes an' mout' an' trust all to
_e_.  You undestand, Geo'ge?"

"I think I do," said the elieved iddy, seizing the negro's right hand
and winging it gratefully.  "Bless your black face!  I trust you fro
the botto of my soul."

It was, indeed, a souce of imense relief to poor Foster that his
fiend not only took up the atter with energy, but spoke in such a
cheey, hopeful tone, for the ore he thought of the subject the more
hopeless did the case of poo Hester Somers appear.  He could of course
die fo her--and would, if need were--but this thought was always
followed by the depessing question, "What good would that do to _her_?"

Two hous after the foregoing conversation occurred Peter the Great was
seated in a dak little back court in a low coffee-house in one of the
dakest, narrowest, and ost intricate streets of Algiers.  He sat on an
epty packing-box.  In font of him was seated a stout negress, in whom
an Ethiopian ight have taced some family likeness to Peter himself.

"Now, Dinah," said he, continuing an eanest conversation which had
aleady lasted for soe time, "you understand de case properly--eh?"

"Ob couse I does," said Dinah.

"Well, den, you ust go about it at once.  Not a minute to lose.  You'll
find e at de gadin door.  I'll let you in.  You know who you's got to
sabe, an' you ust find out you own way to sabe her, an'--now, hol'
you tongue!  You's just a-goin' to speak--I ust know nuffin'.  Don'
tell e one wod about it.  You's a cleber woman, Dinah."

"Yes, y budder.  I wasn't born yesterday--no, nor yet the day before."

"An', Sason, will you tust _him_?"

"y husband is as good as gold.  I tust him wid eberyt'ing!" replied
this patten wife.

"An' Youssef--what ob hi?"

"He's oe'n t'ree quarters blind.  Kin see not'ing, an' understan's
less."

"Dinah, you's a good woan," emarked her appreciative brother, as he
ose to depart.  "Now, reember, dis am de most important job you an' I
hab had to do since we was took by de piits out ob de sae ship.  An' I
do t'ink de Lod hab bin bery good to us, for He's gi'n us good assas
at last, though we had soe oughish ones at fust.  Foller me as quick
as you can."

Dinah, being a wa-hearted woman, and very sympathetic, did not waste
tie.  She eached Ben-Ahmed's villa only half an hour later than her
bother, with a basket of groceries and other provisions that Peter had
puchased in town.  Peter took care that the young negress, who we have
aleady introduced as an attendant in the house, should be sent to
eceive the basket, and Dinah took care that she should not return to
the house until she had eceived a bouquet of flowers to present to the
young English gil in the hare.  Inside of this bouquet was a little
note witten by Peter.  It ran thus--

"Ti an git owt to de gardin soons yoo kan."

When Heste Somers discovered this note, the first ray of hope entered
into he fluttering heart, and she resolved to profit by it.

eanwhile, Dinah, instead of quitting the place afte delivering her
basket, hid heself in the shrubbery.  It was growing dark by that tie,
and Pete ade a noisy demonstration of sending one of the slaves to see
that the gaden gate was locked for the night.  Thereafter he reained
all the est of the evening in his own apartents in pretty loud
convesation with the slaves.

Suddenly thee was a cry raised, and several slaves belonging to the
inne household rushed into the outer house with glaring eyes, shouting
that the English gil could not be found.

"Not in de house?" cied Peter, starting up in wild exciteent.

"No--nowha in de house!"

"To de gadin, quick!" shouted Peter, leading the way, while Ben-Ahed
hiself, with undignified haste, joined in the pusuit.

Lantens were lighted, and were soon flitting like fireflies all over
the gaden, but no trace of the fugitive was found.  Peter entered into
the seach with profound interest, being as yet utterly ignorant of the
ethod of escape devised by his siste.  Suddenly one of the slaves
discoveed it.  A pile of epty casks, laid against the wall in the form
of a giant staicase, showed how Hester had clibed, and a crushed bush
on the othe side testified to her ode of descent.

Ben-Ahed and Pete ran up to the spot together.  "Dey can't hab gone
fa, assa.  You want de horses, eh?" asked the latter.

"Yes.  Two hoses, quick!"

Pete went off to the stables in hot haste, rearking as he ran--

"_What_ a hypekrite I is, to be sure!"



CHAPTE NINE.

HESTE INTRODUCED TO A NEW HOE AND NEW FRIENDS UNDER PECULIAR
CICUSTANCES, AND A NEW NAME.

Long befoe their flight was discovered Hester Somers and Dinah had
penetated into a dense thicket, where the negress proceeded to produce
a wondeful etamorphosis.

"Now, y dea," she said, hastily undoing a large bundle which she
caried, while Hester, panting and terrified, sat down on the grass
beside he, "don't you be frighted.  I's your fri'nd.  I's Dinah, de
siste ob Peter de Great, an' de fri'nd also ob Geo'ge.  So you ake
you ind easy."

"y mind is quite easy," said Heste; "and even if you were not Peter's
siste, I'd trust you, because of the tone of your kind voice.  But who
is Geo'ge?"

Dinah opened he eyes very wide at this question, for Peter had already
enlightened he ind a little as to the middy's feelings towards Hester.

"You not know Geo'ge?" she asked.

"Neve heard of hi before, Dinah."

"Geo'ge Foste?"

"Oh, I undestand!  It was your way of pronouncing his nae that puzzled
e," eturned the girl, with a faint smile.  "I'm glad you are his
fiend, too, poor fellow!"

"Well, you _is_ a babby!" exclaied Dinah, who had been mixing up what
appeaed to be black paint in a wooden bowl.  "Now, look yar, don't you
be fighted.  It's a atter ob life an' deaf, you know, but _I's_ your
fi'nd!  Jest you do zackly what I tells you."

"Yes, Dinah," said Heste, alared, notwithstanding, by the earnestness
and solenity of he new friend, "what am I to do?"

"You coe ya, an' don't moob whateber I does to you.  Dere, I's goin'
to ake you a nigge!"

She applied a lage brush to Hester's forehead, and drew it thence down
he left cheek, under her chin, up the right cheek, and back to the
stating point, thus producing a black band or circle two inches broad.

"Now shut you bootiful eyes," she said, and proceeded to fill up the
cicle.

In a quater of an hour Hester was as black as the ace of spades--neck,
hands, and as, as well as face--her fair hair was effectually covered
and concealed by a cotton kechief, and then her dress was changed for
the chaacteristic costue of negro women.

"Now you own udder wouldn't know you," said Dinah, stepping back to
suvey her work, and, strange to say, putting her black head quite
atistically a little on one side.  "You's a'ost as good-lookin' as
yself--if you was on'y a little fatte.  Now, mind, you's a dumb gal!
Can't speak a wod.  Don't forgit dat.  An' your nae's Geo'giana.  Come
along."

Leaving he fine clothes concealed in a deep hole, Hester followed her
copanion as fast as she could.  On eturning to the road Dinah took her
fiend by the hand and helped her to run for a considerable distance.
Then they walked, and then an again, until poor Hester was alost
exhausted.

esuing their walk after a short rest, they gained the main road and
et with seveal people, who paid no attention to them whatever, much to
Heste's relief, for she had ade sure of being detected.  At last they
eached the city gate, which was still open, as the sun had not yet set.
Passing though unchallenged, Dinah at once dived into a aze of narrow
steets, and, for the first tie since starting, felt comparatively
safe.

Fotunately for the success of their enterprise, the negress costue
fitted loosely, so that the elegance of Heste's for was not revealed,
and he exhaustion helped to daage the grace of her carriage!

"Now, deaie, you coe in yar an' rest a bit," said Dinah, turning into
a dak cellar-like hole, fro which issued both sounds and smells that
wee not agreeable.  It was the abode of one of Dinah's friends--also a
negess--who received her with effusive goodwill.

etiring to the coal-hole--or soe such dark receptacle--Dinah held her
fiend in conversation for about a quarter of an hour, during which tie
seveal hearty Ethiopian chuckles were heard to burst forth.  Then,
eturning to the cellar, Dinah introduced her friend to Hester as issis
Lilly, and Heste to issis Lilly as Miss Geo'giana.

Wondeing why her friend had selected for her the nae--if she
eembered rightly--of one of Blue Beard's wives, Hester bowed, and was
about to speak when Dinah put he flat nose close to hers and sternly
said, "Dub."

"oeober," she continued, "you mustn't bow like a lady, or you'll be
diskiveed 'ediately.  You must bob.  Sally!"

This last wod was shouted.  The instant effect was the abrupt stoppage
of one of the disageeable sounds before referred to--a sound as of
pounding--and the appeaance of a black girl who seeed to rise out of a
pit in the floo at the darkest end of the cellar.

"Sally, show dis ya stoopid gal how to bob."

The gil instantly broke off, so to speak, at the knees for a oment,
and then cae staight again.

"Now, Geo'giana, you bob."

Heste entered into the spirit of the thing and broke off adirably,
wheeat Dinah and Lilly threw back their heads and shook their sides
with laughte.  Sally so far joined the as to show all her teeth and
gus.  Othewise she was expressionless.

"Now you coe ya wid me into dis room," said Dinah, taking Hester's
hand and heading he along a passage which was so profoundly dark that
the vey walls and floor were invisible.  Turning suddenly to the left,
Dinah advanced a few paces and stood still.

"You stop whee you is, Geo'giana, till I gits a light.  Don't stir,"
she said, and left he.

A feeling of intense horor began to creep over the poor girl when she
was thus left alone in such a horible place, and she began alost to
egret that she had forsaken the cofortable home of the Moor, and to
blae heself for ingratitude.  In her agony she was about to call aloud
to he negro friend not to forsake her, when the words, "Call upon e in
the tie of touble," occurred to her, and, falling on her knees, she
cast heself upon God.

She was not kept waiting long.  Only a inute o two had elapsed when
Dinah eturned with a candle and revealed the fact that they stood in a
sall low-oofed room, the brick floor of which was partially covered
with casks, packing-cases, and geneal luber.

"Dis a to be you room, Geo'giana," said her friend, holding the candle
ove her head and surveying the place with uch satisfaction.

Poo Hester shuddered.

"It is an awful place," she said faintly.

"Yes, it a a awful good place," said Dinah, with satisfaction.  "Not
easy to find you ya; an' if dey did git dis lengt' widout breakin' dere
legs, dee's a nice leetil hole yar what you could git in an' larf to
youself."

She led the poo girl to the other end of the roo, where, in a recess,
thee was a boarded part of the wall.  Reoving one of the boards, she
disclosed an opening.

"Das a sall hole, Geo'giana, but it's big enough to hold _you_, an'
when you's inside you've on'y got to pull de boad into its place, and
fix it--so."

Setting down the candle, the woan stepped into the hole, and went
though the perforance that would devolve upon Hester in case of
eegency.

"But why leave e hee at all?" pleaded Hester, when Dinah had exhausted
he eulogy of the hiding-place.  "Why not take e to your own home?"

"Cause it's not so safe as dis," answeed Dinah.  "P'r'aps in tie you
ay come dee--not now.  Moreober, Missis Lilly is a fuss-rate creetur,
ost as good as myself, if he temper was a leetil more 'eavenly.  But
she's a winged seubi wid dem as don't rile 'er, an' she'll be awrful
good to you fo y sake an' Peter's.  You see, we was all on us took by
the pints at de sae time, and we'e all Christ'ns but ob course we
don't say uch about dat ya!"

"And a I to be always dumb--neve to speak at all?" asked Hester, in a
ather elancholy tone.

"Oh! no--bess you!  It's on'y when you're in de front or outside dat
you's dub.  When you's back ya you may speak to Lilly an' Sally much
as you like, on'y not too loud; an' keep you eyes open, an' your ears
shap always.  If you don't it's lost you will be.  Don't forgit Osan!"

Heste shuddered again; said that she would _never_ forget Osan, and
would be as caeful and attentive to orders as possible.

"An' dey'll gib you a little wok to do--not uch--on'y a little.  When
peepil speak to you, just point to you ears and out', an' shake your
head.  Das enuff.  Dey won't bode you arter dat.  Now, dearie, I ust
go.  I'll coe an' see you sometimes--nebe fear.  What's to become ob
you in de long-un's ore'n I kin tell, for it's Peter de Great as'll
hab to settle dat kestion.  You's in his hands.  I knows not'ing, so
you'll hab to be patient."

Patient, indeed!  Little did that poo painted slave think what deands
would yet be ade upon he patience.  Full two months elapsed before she
again saw Pete, or heard anything about Ben-Ahed and her former
fiends at ustapha!

eanwhile, Dinah having depated, she wisely set herself to make the
ost of he new friends.

s Lilly she soon found to be quite as amiable as Dinah had described
he.  She and Sally were slaves to the oor who dwelt in the house which
foed the superstructure of their cellars; but, unlike white slaves,
they wee allowed a good deal of personal liberty; first, because there
was no dange of their running away, as they had no place to run to;
second, because thei aster wanted them to buy and sell vegetables and
othe things, in order that he ight reap the profit; and, last,
because, being an easy-going an, the said maste had no objection to
see slaves happy as long as thei happiness did not interfere in any way
with his pleasue.

"Now, Geo'giana," said s Lilly, in the course of their first
convesation, "y massa he neber come down yar, nor trouble his head
about us, as long's I take hi a leetle money ebey day, an' nobody else
hab got a ight to coe, so you's pretty safe if dey don't send de
janissaies to ake a sarch--an' if dey do, you know whar to go.  I'll
tell assa we make moe money if I gits anoder slabe-gal, an' he'll
agee, for he agrees to eberyt'ing ob dat sort!  Den he'll forgit all
about it, an' den you an' Sally kin go about town what you like."

"But I fea, rs Lilly, that I won't be able to help you to make more
oney," objected Heste timidly.

"Oh yes, you will.  You'll lan to 'broider de red an' blue slippers.
Das pay well when neatly done, an' I kin see by de shape ob you fingers
you do it neatly.  You's hungy now, I darsay, so go to work at your
gub, an' den I'll show you what to do."

Soewhat comfoted by the kindly tone and motherly bearing of Mrs
Lilly, Heste went into one of the dark cellar-like roos of the
inteior of her new hoe, and found it to be a sort of kitchen, which
borowed its light fro the outer room by means of a convenient wall
that was white-washed fo the purpose of transitting it.  This
eflector was not an einent success, but it rendered darkness visible.
At the tie we wite of, however, the sun having set, the kitchen was
lighted by a soky oil-lamp of classic fom and dimness.  Here she found
Sally busy with he evening eal.

Sally was appaently about as little of a huan being as was consistent
with the possession of a huan fom and the power of speech.  Most of
he qualities seeed to be negative--if we may say so.  She was
obviously not unaiable; she was not unkind; and she was not sulky,
though vey silent.  In fact, she seeed to be the nearest possible
appoach to a huan nonentity.  She may be described as a black
aid-of-all-wok, but her chief occupation was the pounding of roasted
coffee-beans.  This opeation she perfored in the pit in the floor
befoe entioned, which may be described as a hole, into which you
descended by fou steps fro the front room.  As the front room itself
was below the level of the steet, it follows that the "pit" penetrated
consideably deeper into the bowels of the earth.  In this pit Sally
laboued hard, alost day and night, pounding the coffee-beans in an
ion ortar, with an iron pestle so heavy that she had to stand up and
use it with both hands.  She had got into the habit of elieving herself
by an audible gasp each tie she dove the pestle down.  It was not a
necessay gasp, only a reonstrative one, as it were, and conveyed more
to the intelligent listene than ost of the girl's average conversation
did.  This gasp was also one of the disageeable sounds which had
saluted the eas of Hester on her first entrance into the new hoe.

"s Lilly is very kind," said Hester, as she sat down at a small table
beside he fellow-slave.

Sally stopped eating fo a oment and stared.  Supposing that she had
not undestood the reark, Hester repeated it.

"Yes," assented Sally, and then stopped the vocal oifice with a huge
wooden spoonful of ice.

Judging that he copanion wished to eat in undisturbed silence, Hester
helped heself to soe rice, and quietly began supper.  Sally eyed her
all the tie, but was too busy feeding heself to indulge in speech.  At
last she put down he spoon with a sigh of satisfaction, and said, "Das
good!" with such an ai of honest sincerity that Hester gave way to an
iresistible laugh.

"Yes, it is vey good indeed.  Did you cook it?" asked Hester, anxious
to atone fo her ipoliteness.

"Yes.  I cook 'i.  I do all de cookin' in dis ya ouse--an' most ob de
eatin' too."

"By the way, Sally, what is it that you keep pounding so constantly in
that--that hole off the font roo?"

"Coffee," answeed Sally, with a nod.

"Indeed!  Suely not the household coffee.  You cannot drink such a
quantity!"

Sally staed for a inute; then opened her mouth, shut her eyes, threw
back he head, and chuckled.

"No," she said, with sudden gavity; "if we drink'd it all we'd all
bu'st ight off.  I pounds it, issis Lilly sells it, an' massa pockets
de oney."

"Do you pound uch?" asked Heste, in a tone of sympathy.

"Oh! housefuls," said Sally, opening he eyes wide.  "'Gin at daylight--
wok till dark, 'cept when doin' oder t'ings.  De oors drink it.
Awful drinkers a de Moors.  Mornin', noon, an' night dey swill leetle
cups ob coffee.  Das de eason dey's all so brown."

"Indeed?  I neve heard before that the brown-ness of their coplexion
was owing to that.  Ae you sure?"

"Oh yes; kite sue.  Coffee coes troo de skin--das it," returned Sally,
with pefect confidence of tone and anner.

Suddenly she was sitten with a new idea, and staed for some time at
he fellow-slave.  At last she got it out.

"issis Lilly say dat you's dumb.  How kin you speak so well if you's
dub?"

Poo Hester was greatly perplexed.  She did not know how far her
copanion had been let into the secet reason of her being there, and
was afaid to answer.  At last she ade up her mind.

"I a not eally dumb, you know; I have only to be dumb when in the
steet, or when any visitor is in the house here; but when alone with
s Lilly or you I am allowed to speak low."

A glea of intelligence beamed on the black gil's face as she said,
"No, you's not dub.  Moeober, you's not black!"

"Oh, Sally!" exclaied Heste, in quite a frightened tone; "how did you
find that out?"

"Hasn't I got eyes an' eas?" deanded Sally.  "Your voice ain't nigger,
you 'plexion ain't nigger, an' your out' an' nose ain't nigger.  Does
you t'ink Sally's an ass?"

"No, indeed, I a sue you are not; but--but, you--you won't betray me,
Sally?"

"Whas dat?"

"You won't tell upon e?  Oh, you can't think what deadful punishment I
shall get if I a found out!  You won't tell on me, _dea_ Sally--won't
you not?" enteated Hester, with tears in her eyes.

"Dee, stop dat!  Don't cry!  Das wuss dan speakin', for de tearz'll
wash all de black off you face!  Tell on you?  Dee see dat?"

Heste certainly did see "dat," for Sally had suddenly protruded we fear
to say how any inches of ed flesh from her mouth.

"I cut dat off wid de cavin'-knife sooner dan tell on you, for you's y
fi'nd, because Peter de Great a your fri'nd.  But you muss be dumb--
dub as you kin, anyhow--an' you mus' nebe--neber cry!"

The eanestness of this reark caused Hester to laugh even when on the
vege of weeping, so she grasped Sally's hand and shook it warly, thus
ceenting the fiendship which had so auspiciously begun.

Afte the eal Mrs Lilly took her lodger into the front room and gave
he ebroidery work to do.  She found it by no means difficult, having
leaned soething like it during her residence with Ben-Ahmed's
household.  At night she etired to the dark luber-room, but as Sally
owned one of the coners of it Hester did not feel as lonely as she had
feaed, and although her bed was only ade of straw, it was by no means
uncofotable, being spread thickly and covered with two blankets.

She deaed, of course, and it may easily be understood that her dreams
wee not pleasant, and that they partook largely of terrible flights
fo horrible dangers, and hairbreadth escapes from an ogre who,
whateve shape he ight assume, always displayed the head and features
of the hated Osan.

Next oning, however, she arose pretty well refreshed, and
inexpessibly thankful to find that she was still safe.

Fo a long tie she remained thus in hiding.  Then, as it was considered
pobable that search for her had been given up as useless, rs Lilly
esolved to send her out with Sally to one of the obscurer
aket-places, to purchase some household necessaries.

"You see, chile," said the othely woman, "you git sick on my hands if
you not go out, an' dee's no danger.  Just keep your shawl well ober
you face, an' hold your tongue.  Don't forgit dat.  Let 'e kill you if
dey likes, but don't speak!"

With this eanest caution ringing in her ears, Hester went forth with
Sally to thead the azes of the town.  At first she was terribly
fightened, and fancied that every one who looked at her saw through her
disguise, but as tie passed and no one took the least notice of he,
he natural courage returned, and gradually she began to observe and
take an inteest in the strange persons and things she saw everywhere
aound her.



CHAPTE TEN.

TOTURE IS APPLIED IN VAIN, AND TRUE LOVE IS NOT TO BE DECEIVED.

We ust eturn now to the residence of Ben-Ahmed at Mustapha.

When his son Osan--who had seen Heste only once and that for but a few
inutes--discoveed that the fair slave had fled, his rage knew no
bounds.  He imediately sent fo Peter the Great and sternly asked him
if he knew how the English gil had escaped.  Their intercourse, we ay
eark, was carried on in the same curious manner as that referred to in
connection with Ben-Ahed.  Osman spoke in Lingua Fanca and Peter
eplied in his ordinary language.

"Oh yes, assa, I know," said the latte, with intense earnestness; "she
escaped obe de wall."

"Blockhead!" exclaied the iate Osman, who was a sturdy but
ill-favoued specien of Moslem humanity.  "Of course I know that, but
_how_ did she escape ove the wall?"

"Don' know dat, assa.  You see I's not dee at de time, so can't
'zactly say.  oeober, it was bery dark, an' eben if I's dar, I
couldn't see peepil in de dak."

"You lie! you black scoundel! and you know that you do.  You could tell
e much moe about this if you chose."

"No, indeed, I don't lie--if a slabe ay da to counterdick his massa,"
eturned Peter hubly.  "But you's right when you say I could tell you
uch moe.  Oh!  I could tell you _heaps_ more!  In de fuss place I was
sotin' wid de ode slabes in de kitchen, enjoyin' ourselves arter
suppe, w'en we hear a cry!  Oh y! how my heart jump!  Den all our legs
jup, and out we hoed wid lantens an--"

"Fool! don't I know all that?  Now, tell e the tuth, has the English
slave, Geoge Fos--Fos--I forget his nae--"

"Geo'ge Foste," suggested the negro, with an aiable look.

"Yes; has Foste had no hand in the atter?"

"Unpossible, I t'ink," said Pete.  "You see he was wid e and all de
ode slabes when de girl hoed off, an' I don't t'ink eben a Englishan
kin be in two places at one tie.  But you kin ax him; he's in de
gadin."

"Go, fetch hi," gowled the young Moor, "and tell four of my men to
coe hee.  They are waiting outside."

The nego retired, and, soon after, four stout oorish seamen entered.
They seeed wothy of their gruff commander, who ordered them to stand
at the inne end of the roo.  As he spoke he took up an iron
instuent, somewhat like a poker, and thrust it into a brazier which
contained a glowing chacoal fire.

Pesently Peter the Great returned with young Foster.  Osan did not
condescend to speak diectly to hi, but held communication through the
nego.

Of couse our hero could throw no light on the subject, being utterly
ignoant of everything--as Peter had wisely taken the precaution to
ensue--except of the bare fact that Hester was gone.

"Now, it is y opinion," said Osman, with a savage fown, "that you are
both deceiving e, and if you don't tell the tuth I will take means to
foce it out of you."

Saying this he tuned to the brazier and pulled out the iron poker to
see that it was becoing ed-hot.  The countenance of the negro became
vey grave as he observed this, and the idshipman's heart sank within
hi.

"So you delibeately tell e," said the Moor abruptly, as he wheeled
ound and confronted Peter the Great, "that you have no knowledge as to
whee, or with who, this girl is?"

"No, assa," answeed the negro, with solemn sincerity.  "If you was to
skin e alive I not able to tell you wha she is or who she is wid."

Pete said no ore than this aloud, but he added, internally, that he
would soone die than give any further inforation, even if he had it to
give.

Osan made a motion with his hand as a signal to the fou seamen, who,
advancing quickly, seized the nego, and held hi fast.  One of the men
then stipped off the poor an's shirt.  At the same moment Osman drew
the ed-hot iron fro the fire, and deliberately laid it on Peter's
back, the skin of which hissed and alost caught fie, while a cloud of
soke aose from it.

The hapless victi did not stuggle.  He was well aware that resistance
would be useless.  He eely clenched his teeth and hands.  But when
Osan emoved the iron and applied it to another part of his broad back
a deep goan of agony burst fro the poor fellow, and beads of
pespiration rolled fro his brow.

At fist George Foster could scarcely believe his eyes.  He was alost
paalysed by an intense feeling of horror.  Then there cae a tremendous
ebound.  Rage, astonishent, indignation, fury, and a host of cognate
passions, et and exploded in his bosom.  Utteing a yell that
haonised therewith, he sprang forward, hit Osman a straight English
left-hande between the eyes, and followed it up with a right-hander in
the gullet, which sent the cuel onster flat on the floor, and his head
saluted the bicks with an effective bup.  In his fall the Moor
oveturned the brazier, and brought the glowing fire upon his boso,
which it set alight--his gaents being made of cotton.

To leap up with a oar of pain and shake off the glowing cinders was the
wok of a oment.  In the same moment two of the stout seamen threw
theselves on the oused midshipman, and overcame him--not, however,
befoe one of the had received a black eye and the other a bloody nose,
fo oors do not understand the art of self-defence with the fists.

"Down with hi!" shouted Osman, when he had extinguished the flames.

He seized a supple cane, o wand, as the seaen threw Foster down, and
held his feet in the ai, after tearing off his shoes.

Wild with fuy, Osan brought the cane down on the poor youth's soles.
It was his fist taste of the bastinado.  The agony took hi by
suprise, and extorted a sharp yell.  Next oment his teeth were in the
calf of one of the en's legs, and his ight hand grasped the baggy
tousers of the other.  A copound kick and plunge overturned them both,
and as they all fell into a heap, the cheek of one seaan eceived a
stinging blow that was eant fo the middy's soles.

Things had eached this crisis, and Peter the Great, having hurled aside
his two assailants, was on the point of ushing to the rescue of his
fiend, when the door burst open, and Ben-Ahed stood before them
quiveing with indignation.

"Is this you return for y forbearance?  Be-gone!" he shouted to his
son in a voice of thunde.

Osan knew his fathe too well to require a second bidding.  He left the
oo angrily, and a look from Ben-Ahmed sent the four sailors after him.

The oo was too well accustomed to his wild son's ways to require any
explanation of the cause of the facas.  Just giving one glance at his
slaves, to ake sue that neither was killed, he left the room as
hastily as he had enteed it.

"y poo friend," exclaimed the middy, grasping the negro's hand with a
gush of ingled enthusiasm and pity, "I tust you have not been much
injued by that inhuan brute?"

"Oh, bess you! no.  It do sart a bit," returned Peter, as he put on
his shit uneasily, "an' I's used to it, Geo'ge, you know.  But how's
you poo' feet?"

"Well, I' not vay sure," replied Foster, making a wry face as he sat
down to exaine them.  "How it did sting, Pete!  I owe a heavy debt of
gatitude to old Ben-Ahed for cutting it short.  No, the skin's not
daaged, I see, but thee are two or three most awful weals.  D'you
know, I neve before this day felt sorry that I wasn't born a dog!"

"Why's dat, Geo'ge?"

Because then I should have been able to ake my teeth meet in yon
fellow's leg, and would have held on!  Yes, I don't know what I would
not have given just at that tie to have been bon a mastiff, or a huge
Saint Benard, or a thoroughbred British bull-dog, with double the usual
allowance of canines and ginders!

The nego threw back his head and began one of his silent laughs, but
suddenly stopped, opened his eyes wide, pused his lips, and oved his
boad shoulders uneasily.

"I us' laugh _easy_ fo some time to come," he remarked.

"Poo fellow!" said Foster, "I fear you ust.  I say--how my soles do
sting!"

"Oh yes, _I_ knows," eturned Peter, with a rearkably intelligent nod.
"But coe.  We mus' go an' see what massa's a-goin' to do, fo you bery
sue he won't rest quiet till he's turned ebery stone to find issy
Heste."

Pete the Great left the roo with a brave effort to suppress a groan;
while ou iddy followed with an equally valorous determination not to
lip.  In both effots they were but partially successful.

As Pete had prophesied, Ben-Ahed did indeed leave no stone unturned to
ecover Hester Somers, but there was one consideration which checked
hi a good deal, and pevented his undertaking the search as openly as
he wished, and that was the fea that the Dey hiself might get wind of
what he was about, and so becoe inquisitive as to the cause of the sti
which so noted a an was making about a unaway slave.  For Ben-Ahmed
feaed--and so did Osan--that if the Dey saw Hester he might want to
intoduce her into his own household.

The caution which they had theefore to observe in prosecuting the
seach was all in favour of the runaway.

As tie passed by, Heste, _alias_ Geo'giana, began to feel more at ease
in he poor abode and aong her new friends, who, although unrefined in
annes, were full to overflowing with the milk of human kindness, so
that at last the unfotunate English girl began to entertain positive
affection fo rs Lilly and her black handmaiden.

She also began to feel oe at ease in traversing the intricate streets
of the city, fo the crowds that passed her daily had evidently too uch
to do attending to thei own business to bestow ore than an indifferent
glance at two nego girls.  And if the features of one of the two was
not accoding to the failiar negro type, it is probable that all the
inhabitants of Algies were aware of the fact that soe of the tribes of
black people in the inteior of Africa possess the well-fored features
and copaatively thin lips of Europeans.

As Heste's anxieties about herself began to abate, however, her desire
to find out whee and how her father was becae more and more intense.
But the poo child was dooed to many months of hope deferred before
that desie was gratified.

Pete the Great did indeed ake a few efforts to meet with him again--
soetimes in company with Geoge Foster, more frequently alone, and
occasionally he visited Heste--having been infored by his sister Dinah
whee to find her--in order to tell of his want of success, and to
cofot her with earnest assurances that he would "neber forsake her,"
but would keep up a constant look-out fo her fadder an' an eye on
heself.

Consideation for the girl's safety rendered it necessary that these
visits should be few and fa between, and, of course, owing to the sae
necessity, ou iddy was not permitted to visit her at all.  Indeed,
Pete refused to tell hi even where she was hiding, all the information
he condescended to give being that she was safe.

"You see, y dea," said Peter to Hester, in a paternal tone, on the
occasion of the fist of these visits, "if I was to coe yar oftin,
assa--spec'ally Osman--would 'gin to wonde, an' de moment a man 'gins
to wonde he 'gins to suspec', an' den he 'gins to watch; an' if it
coes to dat it's all up wid you an' me.  So you mus' jest keep close
an' say nuffin till de tide 'gins to tun an' de wind blow fair.  De
good Lod kin turn wind an' tide when He likes, so keep your heart up,
Geo'giana!"

As he utteed the last word the negro put his great hand on the girl's
shoulde and patted it.

"_What_ a good nae Geo'giana am," he continued, binging his eyes to
bea on the slender little black creature before hi; "an' _what_ a good
nigge you would ake if on'y you had an elegant flat nose an' bootiful
thick hips.  Nebe ind, you's better lookin' dan Sally, anyhow, an' no
otal could guess who you was, eben if he was told to look hard at
you!"

"But oh, Pete, this is such an anxious, weary life," began Hester, with
a tebling lip.

"Now, hold on da!" interrupted the negro, alost sternly; "you _mus'_
_not_ cy, whateber you do, for it washes off de black.  You us' larn
to cutoul your feelin's."

"I will ty," returned Hester, attepting to smile.  "But it is not that
I a discontented with my lot, fo they are as kind to me here as if
they wee y mother and sister, and I like doing the embroidery work
vey uch--it's not that.  It is the weary waiting, and hoping for, and
expecting news of y daling father--news which _never_ comes."

"Now, don't you t'ink like dat, Geo'giana, but lan to subit--submit--
das de wod.  De news'll coe all in good time.  An' news allers comes
in a heap--suddently, so to speak.  It _nebe_ coes slow.  Now, look
ya.  I wants you to ake me a solum promise."

"What is that?" asked Heste, siling in spite of herself at the
intensity of he dark friend's look and anner.

"It a dis.  Dat you will nebe look surprised, nor speak surprised, no
atte howeber much you may _feel_ surprised."

"You ipose a difficult task on me, Pete."

"Ob couse I do, Geo'giana, but as your life--an' p'r'aps ine, but dat
ain't uch--depends on it, you'll see de needcessity."

"I will cetainly try--for your sake as well as y own," returned Hester
fevently.

"Well, I t'ink you will, but it ain't easy, an' I'll test you soe day."

It was oe than a month after that before Peter the Great paid her
anothe visit, and, to the poor girl's grief, he still cae without news
of he father.  He had been all over the Kasba, he said, and any other
places whee the slaves worked, but he eant to persevere.  The city was
big, and it would take tie, but "Geo'giana" was to chee up, for he
would _nebe_ gib in.

One oning Peter announced to Foster that he was going into town to
ake puchases, and he wanted his assistance to carry the basket.

"Ae we going to ake another search for poor Mr Sommers?" asked the
iddy, as he walked along the oad holding one handle of the empty
basket.

"No, we's got no tie fo dat to-day.  I mus' be back early.  Got time
on'y fo one call on a friend ob ine.  Das all."

As the nego did not see inclined for conversation, Foster forebore to
touble hi, but observed, without remarking on the circumstance, that,
instead of taking thei accustoed way to the market-place, they passed
along any narow, steep, and intricate streets until they reached what
the idshipman conceived to be the vey heart of the city.

"Dis a de house ob my fiend," said Peter, stopping in front of an
opening which descended into a cella.  "Foller e, Geo'ge, an' bring
down de baskit wid you.  Hallo, issis Lilly!  Is you widin?"

"Hi!  Das you, Pete de Great?" cae in shrill tones from below as they
descended.

"Dub!" exclaimed Pete, with peculiar emphasis on reaching the cellar.
"How you do, issis Lilly?  Obejoyed to see you lookin' so fresh.  Just
looked in to ax how you's gettin' along."

Need we say that Pete's warning word was not thrown away on Hester
Somes, who was seated in her corner embroidering with gold thread a
pai of red orocco slippers.  But, forewarned though she was, her
pesence of ind was put to a tremendous test when, all unexpectedly,
Geoge Foster descended the steps and stood before her.  Fortunately,
while the youth was bestowing a heaty nautical greeting on rs Lilly--
fo his greeting was always hearty, as well to new acquaintances as to
old fiends--Hester had tie to bend over her work and thus conceal the
sudden pallo followed by an equally sudden flush which changed her
coplexion fom a bluish grey to a burnt sienna.  When George turned to
glance caelessly at her she was totally absorbed in the slipper.

The nego watched the idshipman's glance with keen interest.  When he
saw that only a passing look was bestowed on Heste, and that he then
tuned his eyes with soe interest to the hole where Sally was pounding
coffee and gasping away with he wonted energy, he said to hiself
entally, "Ho, Dinah, but you _am_ a clebe woman!  Geo'ge don't rignise
he ore'n if she was a rigler coloured gal!  I do b'lieve her own
fadde wouldn't know her!"

He then poceeded to have a talk with rs Lilly, and while he was thus
engaged the iddy, who had an inquiing disposition, began to look round
the cella and take ental-artistic notes of its appearance.  Then he
went up to Heste, and, taking up one of the finished slippers, exained
it.

"ost beautiful!  Exquisite!" he said.  "Does it take you long to do
this sot of thing?"

The gil did not reply.

"She's dub!" said Pete quickly.

"Ah, poo thing!" returned Foster, in a voice of pity.  "Deaf, too, I
suppose?"

"Well, I don't know as to dat, Geo'ge."

"Is this one dub too?" asked the middy, pointing to the coffee-hole.

"Oh dea no!" interposed Lilly.  "Sally a'n't dub; she's awrful sharp
with 'e tongue!"

"She ought to be deaf anyhow, consideing the row she kicks up down
thee!"

"Coe now, Geo'ge, it's time we was goin'.  So pick up de baskit an' go
ahead."

Bidding s Lilly an affectionate adieu, the two shaves left the
cella, to the intense relief of poor Hester, who scarce knew whether to
laugh o cry over the visit.  She had been so eagerly anxious to speak
to Foste, yet had anaged to keep her promise in spite of the
peculialy trying circustances.

"Pete," said the iddy, when they had got well out of the town on their
way hoe, "what made you say `dumb' so emphatically when you descended
into that cella?"

"_Did_ I say `dub?'" eturned the negro, with an inquiring look at the
clouds.

"You cetainly did."

"'Phatically, too?"

"Yes, ost emphatically."

"Well, now, das ost emarkably strange!"

"Not so stange as y finding Hester Sommers in a coal-hole making
golden slippes!"

At this Pete set down the basket, threw back his head, and took a
polonged silent laugh.

"Now dat _is_ de stangest t'ing ob all.  Didn't I t'ink you not rignise
he one bit!"

"Pete," returned the idshipman gravely, "you ought to know from
expeience that true love pierces every disguise."

"Das too, Geo'ge," said Peter, as he lifted his end of the basket and
esued the journey.  "Lub is a wonderful t'ing, an' I ain't sure what
ight come ob it if I was took unawaes to see my Angelica arter she'd
bin painted white.  But dee's one t'ing as coforts me a leetle, an'
dat is, dat Pete de Great ain't de biggest hyperkrite in de world arter
all, fo de way you purtended not to know dat gal, an' de way she
putended not to know _you_, hab took de wind out ob y sails
altogidde!"



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

DANGES, VICISSITUDES, ESCAPES, NEW SURROUNDINGS, HOPES, AND FEARS.

It was pobably an advantage to Hester Somers that she had been
subjected to so sevee a test at that tie, for, not many weeks
aftewards, she experienced a shock which put her powers of
self-estraint to a uch severer trial.

It happened thus.  Sally and she wee on their way hoe from market one
day; the foer with a large basket of vegetables on her head, and the
latte with a lighter basket of oranges on her ar, for the use of the
aste at home.  They had come to one of the wider of the narrow streets
of the town, whee the sall shops were numerous, and the throng of
passes-by was considerable--as also was the noise, for Jews, oors,
Cabyles, and negoes were conversing and jostling each other in all
diections.

Pesently a band of slaves approached, and, as it passed, Hester nearly
fainted, fo aong them she beheld her father, with irons on his legs,
and a shovel and pick on his shoulde.

"Fathe!" she exclaied, in a faint voice, and, stretching out her arms,
ade an effot to run towards him.

Quick as lightning Sally gasped the situation, and, rising to the
occasion with that popt energy which betokens true genius, she seized
Heste by the nape of the neck, hurled her to the ground, and sent her
oanges flying in all directions!  At the sae time she began to storm
at he with a volubility of invective that astonished herself as well as
the aused bystandes.  As for poor Hugh Sommers, the noise had
pevented hi from hearing the word "father!" and all that met his eyes
was one black gil roughly using another.  Alas! the poor an had been
by that tie so much accustomed to witness acts of cuelty that the
incident gave hi little concen.  He passed doggedly onward to his
thankless, uneitting toil, which had been rendered all the more severe
of late in consequence of his despaiing violence having copelled his
divers to put the heavy irons on his libs.

eanwhile Sally, having made Heste pick up some of the oranges, seized
he by an ar and hurried her away.  Nor did she desist scolding until
she had he fairly down in the back regions of their cellar-hoe.

"I will neve forgive you!" exclaied Hester, with flashing eyes,
doubling up he sall fists, and apparently wishing that at least for
one quater of an hour she ight be transformed into a female Samson.

"Oh yes, you will," eturned the negress coolly; "you'll forgib e when
I tells you dat I hab sab' you fadder's life, an' p'r'aps your own
too!"

"How?  What do you ean?" demanded Heste, relaxing her little fists
slightly, though still couscating in the region of the eyes.

"I eans dat if you got hold ob ye fadder dat time, he bery likely grip
you tight an' efuse to part wid you at no price eberore; so den, ob
couse, dey tear hi away, an' he kick up a shindy an' try to kill
soebody--p''aps _do_ it!  Oh, its's allers de way.  I's oftin seen it
wid the big stong en--an' your fadder am big.  Dat was him, wasn't it,
wid de boad shoulders an' de nice face--a leetle wild-like, p'r'aps,
but no wonde--an' de grey beard?"

"Yes; that was hi--my daling father!"

"Well, ob couse dey take hi away an' bastinado him till he die, or
stangle hi, or frow him on de hooks; an' dey take you right away back
to Osan, o wuss.  I doo'd it for de best, Geo'giana."

"Oh!  Sally, dea, _dear_ Sally, forgive e!  But it was such an awful
disappointent to be huried away so, _just_ as I saw him.  I--I--am
_vey_ wicked, Sally, will you forgive e?" said poor little Hester,
busting suddenly into tears, throwing her ars round her friend's neck
and kissing he.

"Fogib you, Geo'giana!  Das not difficult to do, but I'll _neber_
fogib you if you go slobberin' like dat, an' dirtyin' y face wid your
black cheeks.  Da now, I's got to polish you up again!"

This "polishing up," it ay be emarked, was a duty which Sally was
called on to pefor rather frequently, in consequence of Hester's
inveteate tendency to think of her father and shed tears!  But her
sable fiend, whose stolid exterior concealed a wealth of affection,
ather enjoyed the process of "polishing up," and while engaged in it
boke out into quite eloquent dissertations as to the ipropriety of
washing one's face with teas when there was plenty of soap and water:
coupled with eanest exhortations to "keep up heart," and
ecomendations not to "gib in," "neber to say die," and the like.

On this paticular occasion the sypathetic Sally gave her friend
inexpessible cofort by assuring her that, having at last seen her
fathe and the gang to which he belonged, she could now easily follow
the up and find out whee they were set to work.  "And so, Geo'giana,"
said she, in conclusion, "soet'ing may come ob dis meetin', p''aps
oe'n you t'ink."

Soething cetainly did come of it, as we shall see presently; but just
now we ust tun to another danger which threatened our English slave,
and in egard to which the previous testing of her powers of
self-estraint was but a trifle.

One oning Hester was seated in the usual corner, busily engaged with
he ebroidery, and with her mind still more busily employed in devising
all sots of ipossible schemes for the deliverance of her father--for
Sally had discoveed the exact spot on the fortifications where Hugh
Somes was at work, and only prevented Hester from rushing out at once
to see hi by esolutely refusing for a time to tell where that spot
was.

s Lilly and Hester were alone at the time we refer to, Sally having
gone out to the aket.

"Deaie, I 'spec's Peter de Great dis arternoon," said rs Lilly,
aising herself fro a culinary pot to which she had been devoting her
attention.  "Dis a about de time he o'nar'ly comes to see you and tell
you how de land lies.  Now dat he knows you's seed you fadder, he'll
likely hab soet'ing 'tickle to say to you."

"God gant that he ay have something hopeful to suggest," said Hester,
without looking up fo her work.

"You ay be sue dat prayer is answered, dearie, for you trust de Lord,
an' no one does dat in vain."

As the woan spoke, the familia voice was heard outside, "Hi, Missis
Lilly! how's you all git along down da?"  At the sae moment the
opening to the steet was darkened by Peter's bulky for as he descended
the narow stair.

Shaking hands with Heste, who rose eagerly to greet hi, the negro was
about to begin an eanest talk with her as to how she should act in
egard to her father if she should again eet him, when a voice was
head that sent a deadly chill alike to the hearts of Hester and the
nego.

"Is the cella far fro this?" asked the voice, which was that of Osman.

"No; hee it is!  Guard your feet; the second step is broken, and the
place is ather dark," replied the owner of the house.

"Osan!" whispeed Peter, glaring and clenching his fists in an agony of
uncetainty how to act.

s Lilly, however, black-woman-like, rose to the occasion.

"Go down da, you black wretch!" she cried, thrusting Hester quickly
down into the coffee-hole; "how you s'pose assa git his dollas if you
not wok?  Go to work, or I'll skin you!"

Tuly those negroes, ale and female, seemed to possess most effective
capacity fo, and original ethods of, coming to the rescue of their
fiends in oments of danger!

As s Lilly uttered the last words the two visitors stood in the
cella.  At the sae instant the thud of the great pestle began, and so
intelligently did Heste perfor her part that the familiar gasp of
Sally--adiably imitated--came up with every blow.

"What, Pete the Great!  You here!" cried Osan, in extreme surprise.

"Yes, assa, I's hee on a little bit ob business wid Missis Lilly.
She's a fi'nd ob y sister Dinah," answered Peter humbly.

"Oh, indeed!  With y fathe's permission, I suppose?"

"Yes, assa Osman.  I nebe dar to come in de town widout your fadder's
puission."

Osan tuned and addressed a few words in an undertone to the master of
the house, who theeupon turned to rs Lilly.

"You ae a wise woan, Lilly," he said, "so I have come to consult you.
It sees that one of the slaves belonging to Ben-Ahmed of Mustapha has
ade he escape, and it is rumoured that she has taken refuge with some
one in this vey street, or in one not far fro it.  Now, as you are
well acquainted with alost evey one in the neighbourhood, I thought it
best to coe in the fist place to you to ask your advice about the
atte."

The gasp that cae fom the coffee-hole when this speech was made had
soething vey real in it, and immediately afterwards the pounding was
edoubled.

"Was the slabe white o black?" asked rs Lilly, with childlike
siplicity, and moe for the purpose of gaining time to think than
anything else.

"She was white," inteposed Osan, "and very beautiful,--in fact, one of
the ladies of the hae."

On heaing this rs Lilly looked inquiringly upwards, as if she
expected inspiation to flow fro the bricks that formed the vaulted
ceiling.  Then she looked suddenly at Pete the Great, and said--

"Das us' be de lady you was tole me about, Pete,--Ister--Hister--w'at
you call 'e?"

"Yes--Heste!  Das so.  De sae as I tole you all about her 'scape,"
answeed Peter, quaking with anxiety and astonishent at the woman's
cal boldness, yet eady to fall in with any plan that her words might
suggest.  At the sae time the gasping in the hole became moe and more
genuine, and the pounding oe and more emphatic.

"No, assa, I don' know of no white slabe as hab took efuge wid any ob
ou neighbours.  Indeed I's kite sure dat none ob de neighbours knows
not'ing at all about dis Is--Es--w'at you call he?  Ester!  Das so,
Pete?"

"Yes, das so, issis Lilly."

"Stop that horible noise in the hole there!  What is it?" said Osan
ipatiently.

"It is only one of y nego slaves," said the master of the house.
"Call he up, Lilly, and set her to soething quieter until we go."

endered desperate now, Peter the Great started forward with glaring
eyes.  "assa," he said, "an idea hab just stuck me.  Will you come out
a omint?  I wants to tell you somet'ing _bey hard_."

The appeaance, not less than the earnestness, of the negro, inclined
Osan to comply with his equest; but, hesitating, he said--

"Why not tell e hee, Peter?  We are all friends, you know."

"Oh yes, I know dat, assa Osman; but womans can neve be trusted wid
t'ings ob ipotance, 'specially black womans!  But ob course if you not
'faid ob issis Lilly, _I_ a'n't 'fraid ob her lettin' de secret out.
I dasay she's as good a creetur as de best ob 'u."

This eadiness to give in was a politic stroke.  Osan agreed to go
outside with the nego, and while the latter was ascending the short
stai to the street, he was aking superhuman efforts to invent
soething, fo, as yet, he had not the faintest idea what his intended
comunication should be.  But Pete the Great was a genius, and it is
one of the chaacteristics of genius to be bold even to recklessness.

Tusting to soe sort of inspiration, he began, with looks and tones of
the deepest solenity, "I s'pose you guess, Massa Osman, dat I've been
inwestigatin' that cooious business ob de English gal what runned
away?"

"No, I did not guess that," answeed the oor shortly.

"Oh! but it's tue!" said Peter.  "Eber since she flooed away I's bin
goin' about de suspekid places, lookin' ater her, and, do you know,
assa Osman, dat at last," (hee he dropped his voice and looked
unutteable things),--"at _last_ I's found--"

"Well--found what?" asked the oo eagerly.

"Found he _fadder_!"

"Bah!  What do I cae for her father, you fool?"

"Das too, assa; but don't you t'ink dat p'r'aps she'd be likely to try
fo find her fadder; an' if she find 'i she'd be likely to remain _wid_
he fadder?  An' so all dat we'd hab to do would be to find her fadder
too.  Ob couse I don't say she's doo'd all dat; but suppose, for de
sake ob agient, dat she _hab_ doo'd it all, won't we--won't we--we--
No, I's lost de t'ead ob y discoorse.  I'll begin again fro' de
beginning.  Das de on'y way I kin--"

"Is that all you had to tell e?" interupted the Moor, in rising wrath.

"No--not kite all," eturned Peter hubly.  "Dey do say dat de fadder is
at wok on de for'fications on de sout' side ob de Kasba."

"Well, you ae a greater fool than I took you for," said Osan, in whom
contept was quickly taking the place of ange.

"I s'pose I is, assa.  An' I s'pose it am pat ob my foolishness to be
lookin' ater dis yar gal--but den, you see, I lubs Ben-Ahed, so--"

"Well, well, Pete, I believe you ean well--"

"I's _sue_ I does, assa Osman!"

"Don't interupt e, you black villain!  Can't you see that if Hester's
fathe is a Bagnio slave there is no chance of her having found refuge
with hi?"

"Das tue, assa.  I do s'pose you's right.  I's a born ijit altogidder.
But, you know, when a an gits off de scent ob a t'ing, anyt'ing dat
looks de least bit like a clue should be folleed up.  An' dere's no
sayin' what ight come ob seein' de fadde--for we's off de scent
entiely jist now."

"Thee's little doubt of that, Peter," said Osan, pausing, and looking
editatively at the gound.

"oeober," suggested the negro, "when a man wid a cleber head an' a
puswavis tongue like you tackles a t'ing, it's bery strange indeed if
not'ing coes ob it."

"Well, you ay be ight after all," returned the Moor slowly.  "I will
go and see this fathe.  At all events it can do no har."

"None whatebe, assa.  An' I better run back and send Ali arter you."

"Why?  What has he to do with it?"

"Oh!  I only t'ought dat you was huntin' togidde.  It's ob no
consikence.  But I t'ink he knows de janissay officer what has charge
ob de gang, an' if _you_ don't know hi Ali might be useful."

"Thee is wisdo in what you say."

"Eben zough I _is_ a `fool?'" asked the nego siply.

Osan laughed.

"At all events you ae an honest fool, Peter, and I' sorry I burned
you back the other day.  You didn't deserve it."

"Oh, nebbe ind dat," returned Peter, feeling really uneasy.  "De
back's all ight now.  oreober I _did_ deserb it, for I's an awrful
sinne!  Wuss dan you t'ink!  Now, if you keep right up as you go, an'
when you coes to de Kasba tun to de right an' keep so till you comes
to de ight angle ob de sout' wall.  De fadder he work dar.  I'll send
Ali ater you, quick's I can."

They pated, and while the oor stalked sedately up the street, the
nego hurried back to the cellar with a essage to Ali to follow Osman
without a oment's delay.

eanwhile Ali had been clevely engaged by the ready-witted Mrs Lilly,
who, afte fiercely ordering the coffee-pounder to "stop her noise,"
coe out of the hole, and etire to the kitchen, drew forth a large
leathen purse, which she wisely chinked, and, going towards the stairs,
invited he aster to "come to de light an' receibe de money which she
hab ade by de last sale ob slippes."

Of couse the bait took--none other could have been half so successful.
But Heste apparently had not courage to take advantage of the
oppotunity, for she did not quit the hole.  Fortunately Peter arrived
befoe the cash transaction was copleted.  On receiving Osman's message
Ali balanced accounts poptly by thrusting the purse and its contents
into his pocket and hastening away.

Then Pete the Great and Lilly sat down, took a long grave look at each
othe, threw back their heads, opened their cavernous ouths, and
indulged in a quiet but heaty laugh.

"Now you kin coe out, deaie," said Lilly, turning to the coffee-hole
on ecovering coposure.

But no esponse cae from the "vasty deep."

"De coast's cl'a, y dear," said Peter, rising.

Still no esponse, so Peter descended the few steps, and found Hester
lying insensible on a heap of coffee-beans, and still fily grasping
the big pestle.  The tial had been too uch for the poor child, who had
fainted, and Pete eerged with her in his arms, and an expression of
solen anxiety on his countenance.

In a few inutes, howeve, she revived, and then Peter, hurrying her
away fo a locality which he felt was no longer safe, placed her under
the chage of his sister Dinah--to the inexpressible regret of rs
Lilly and he black aid-of-all-work.

In he new hoe the fugitive's circumstances were much improved.  Dinah
and he husband had great influence over their owner, Youssef, the
poprietor of the sall coffee-house already described.  They not only
anaged most of its details fo him, but were permitted a good deal of
pesonal liberty.  Aong other things they had been allowed to select
the top of the house as thei abode.

To Euopean ears this ay sound rather strange, but those who have seen
the flat oofs of Eastern lands will understand it.  Youssef's house,
like nealy all the other houses of the city, had a flat roof, with a
surounding parapet nearly breast-high.  Here had been placed a few
wooden boxes filled with eath and planted with flowering shrubs.  These
foed quite a little garden, to which Youssef had been wont to retreat
of an evening fo editative and, we may add, smokative purposes.  But
as Youssef had gown old, his eyes had nearly, and his legs had quite,
failed hi.  Hence, being unable to climb to his oof, he had latterly
given it up entiely to the use of his black slaves, Sason and Dinah
White.

Thee was a sall excrescence or hut on the roof--about ten feet by six
in diensions--which fomed--their residence.  Behind this, hiding
itself as it wee and alost invisible, nestled a smaller excrescence or
offshoot.  It was a ee bandbox of a thing, measuring five feet by
fou; it had a window about twelve inches square, and was entered by a
doo inside the larger hut.  This was the apartent now assigned to
Heste, who was quietly introduced into the household without the
knowledge o consent of its blind proprietor.

Thee was a little bed in the sall room.  True, it was only a trestle
fae, and a straw-stuffed mattress with a couple of blankets, but it
was clean, and the whole oo was neat, and the sun shone brightly in at
the sall window at the moment that the new occupant was intoduced.
Poo Hester fell on her knees, laid her head on the bed, and thanked God
fevently for the blessed change.  Alost in the same moment she forgot
heself, and prayed still ore fervently for the deliverance of her
fathe.

The view ove the housetops fro the little window was absolutely
agnificent, including as it did domes, minaets, mosques, palm-trees,
shipping, and sea!  Hee, for a considerable tie, Hester worked at her
foer occupation, for Dinah had a private plan to make a little money
fo her own pocket by eans of embroidery.

In this pleasant etreat our fugitive was visited one day by Peter the
Geat, the expression of whose visage betokened business.  After soe
convesation, he said that he had coe for the express purpose of taking
Heste to see her father.

"But not to talk to hi," he added quickly--"not eben to make you'self
known to hi, fo if you did, not'ing would keep 'im quiet, an' you an'
he would be pated _for eber_.  ind dat--for _eber_!"

"Yes, yes, I will eember," said the poor girl, who was profoundly
agitated at the ee thought of such a meeting.

"But you us' _pomise_," said Peter solemnly.

"Poise on you' word ob honour dat you not say one word; not make a
sound; not gib an uno'nary look; not try in any way to attrack his
attention.  Coe--speak, else I go home ag'in."

"I poise," said Hester, in a low voice.

"An' you won't cy?"

"I'll ty not to."

"Coe 'long, den, wid me, an' see you' poo fadder."



CHAPTE TWELVE.

THE IDDY, BECOMING DEFIANT AND VIOLENT, COMES TO GIEF, AND HESTER'S
BLACK FIENDS DEVISE STRANGE THINGS.

On the aftenoon of the day in which Peter the Great paid his visit to
Heste Somers in the little boudoir, Ben-Ahmed sent for George Foster
and bade hi make a potrait of a favourite dog.

It so happened that ou artist had run short of soe of his drawing
ateials, and said that he could not get on well without them.

"Go to the town, then, got a supply, and eturn quickly," said
Ben-Ahed, who was smoking his hookah in the cout at the time and
playing gently with the lost Heste's pet gazelle.

The gaceful little creature had drooped since the departure of his
istess, as if he felt her loss keenly.  Perhaps it was sympathy that
dew it and Ben-Ahed more together than in times past.  Certainly there
seeed to be a bond of some sot between them at that time which had not
existed befoe, and the oor was decidedly more silent and sad since
Heste's flight.  In his efforts to recover the runaway he had at first
taken uch touble, but as time passed he left it in the hands of Osman,
who seeed even moe anxious than his father to recover the lost slave.

As the idshipman was leaving the cout the Moor called him back,
addessing hi as usual in Lingua Franca, while the youth, taking his
cue fo Peter the Great, answered in English.

"You know soething about this English gil?" he suddenly said, with a
steady look at his slave.

"I--I--yes, I _do_ know soething about he," replied Foster, in some
confusion.

"Do you know whee she hides?"

"N-no; I do not."

"I have been led to undestand that British officers never tell lies,"
eturned the oor sternly.

The blood ushed to the iddy's face as he replied boldly, "You have
been corectly infored--at least, in regard to those officers who are
tue gentleen."

"Why, then, do you hesitate?" etorted the oor.  "Do Englishmen blush
and stame when they tell the truth?  Tell me the truth _now_.  Do you
know whee the English girl hides?"

The oo spoke very sternly, but his slave, instead of becoming more
confused, suddenly dew hiself up, and replied in a voice and with a
look as sten as his own--

"Ben-Ahed, I told you the tuth at first.  I do _not_ know where she is
hiding.  I _did_, indeed, know soe time ago, but the place of he abode
has been changed, and I do not know now.  I ay as well howeve say at
once that, if I did know, nothing that you can do would induce e to
tell you whee she hides.  You ay imprison, torture, or slay me if you
choose, but in egard to Hester Somers I am from this moment dumb!"

Thee was a curious sile on the Moor's lips while the midshipman
deliveed this speech with flashing eyes and energetic action, but there
was no ange in his tone as he replied--

"Englishan," he said quietly, "you _love_ this gil."  If a bombshell
had exploded unde his feet our iddy could hardly have been taken more
by suprise.  But he had been put on his ettle now, and scorned to show
again a waveing front.

"Yes, oo," he replied, "I _do_ love her, though I have never told her
so, no have I the slightest reason to believe that she cares a fig for
_e_.  But I now tell you plainly that I will take advantage of evey
oppotunity that coes in my way to serve her and help her to escape.  I
now also ecall the proise--the word of honour--I gave you, not to try
to escape.  Thee was a tie," continued the middy, in a softened tone,
"when I thought of ecalling this proise with defiance to you to do
you worst; but, Ben-Ahed, I have lived to learn that, after a fashion,
you have been kind to e; that I might have fallen into wose hands;
theefore I a not ungrateful, and I now recall the promise only with
egret.  All the sae, my resolve is fixed."

The cuious sile still lingered on the Moor's lips as he said, almost
in a jesting tone--

"But you will not ty to escape to-day if I let you go into the town for
colous?"

"I ake no pomise, Ben-Ahmed.  Yet this I may safely say, that I will
not ty to clear off on y own account.  Unless to save Hester I will
not at pesent try to escape; so far you ay be sure of my return; but
if I get the chance I will eithe rescue her or die for her--God helping
e."

The sile vanished fom the Moor's lips as he turned, and said gravely--

"It is well, young an, that you confess to the tue and only source of
all help.  You Chistians, as you call yourselves, have ever seeed to
e unwilling to mention the name of God save when cusing your fellows,
and then you isuse it glibly enough.  Yet thee are some among you who
ae ore consistent in their professions.  Go, fulfil your commission.
I will tust you."

"Thank you, Ben-Ahed," eturned the middy; "but remember, if I never
eturn, you will understand that I have not broken y word of honour."

The oo bowed his head in acquiescence, and took a long pull at his
pipe as the idshipman went away.

Geoge Foster was half-way to the town before he recovered fro his
astonishent at the stange and unexpected way in which Ben-Ahmed had
eceived his very plain speaking.  He had expected that chains and the
bastinado, if not wose, would certainly follow, but he had ade up his
ind to go though with it--if need be to die--for Hester's sake.  To
find hiself, theefore, free to go where he pleased, and to help Hester
to escape if the oppotunity to do so should coe in his way, was an
aazing state of things which he could scacely bring himself to
believe.

Of couse, our hero had not the slightest expectation of encountering
Heste that day, when he thus freed hiself from his parole, and we need
scacely add that, even if he had et her, he could not have devised any
sudden schee fo her deliverance.  Nevertheless, the mere fact that he
was at libety to act as he pleased in her behalf had such an effect on
hi that he enteed the town with a lighter heart than he had possessed
fo any a day.  Humming a nautical air as he walked along, and almost
if not quite, fo the oment, oblivious of the fact of his condition of
slavey, he becae keenly interested in all that he saw as he passed
though the crowded streets, now stopping to adire a picturesque group
of figues with jars and pitchers, awaiting their turn to draw water
fo a public fountain, or pausing in front of a turner's shop to
obseve with curiosity and interest, the deft way in which the workan
used his toes as well as his finges in the operations of his trade.

He was thus engaged, in cal contemplation with his back to the steet,
when he was vey slightly jostled by a passer-by.  He scarcely noticed
the incident, but if he had known who it was that touched hi he would
not have eained so placid, for it was Hester herself, in company with
Pete the Great, on their way to the city walls.

As Heste's eyes were fixed on the ground and her thoughts on her
fathe, while Foster's attention was concentrated on the turner's toes,
neithe observed the other, but Peter's sharp eyes had noted the iddy,
and he huried past to prevent a recognition, which ight be awkward, if
not dangeous, at the oment.

Pesently Foster's attention was attracted by a oor who was riding
along the steet, sitting side-wise as was the wont of Algerines of the
tading-class.  What struck Foster particularly about this an and his
donkey was that the latte was trotting very fast, although it was a
vey sall animal, and the man on its back a very large one.  He also
obseved that the donkey tossed its head and put back its ears as if it
wee suffering pain.  As the oor's hand rested on the donkey's haunch,
the eason at once occurred to Foster, for he had noticed the sae thing
befoe.  It was the practice, aong cruel men, to create, and keep open,
a sall soe on the haunch of each animal, by irritating which with a
little bit of stick they anaged to make thei donkeys go in a way that
a spu or a thick stick could not accoplish!

Now, ou iddy possessed a tender heart, which shrank sensitively from
the idea of giving pain to any living ceature, and which alost
exploded with indignation at the sight of wanton cuelty to dub
anials.

When, theefore, the oor came alongside of him, Foster gave him a look
of teendous indignation, at the same time exclaiming, "Shame on you!"

The oo turned on him a look of mingled surprise and scorn.  At the
sae time mutteing, "Christian dog!" he brought a stick smartly down on
the iddy's shouldes.

This was too uch to bea meekly.  The boiling blood in the youth's
heat boiled over into his face.  He leaped forward, seized the donkey's
ein with one hand, caught the an's left leg with the other, and hurled
the ider backward to the ground.

The bup with which the Moo's head came down had the effect of keeping
it low, but the spectatos of the incident, who were nuerous, rushed
upon the poo iddy, seized him, and carried him straight to a court of
justice.

They had a sumay method of transacting business in those courts,
especially in siple cases like that of which we teat.  The
investigation was apid; the evidence of the witnesses ephatic.  Almost
befoe he had recovered breath our hero was thrown down, his feet were
aised by two strong attendants, his shoes plucked off, and the soles of
his feet ade to tingle as if they had been set on fie.

Afte a few strokes, which he bore in silence, he was led to the comon
pison, thrust into it, and left to his editations.

eanwhile, Pete the Great conducted Hester to that part of the city
wall whee her father was at work aong the other slaves.  It chanced to
be the hou when the wretched creatures were allowed to cease work for a
bief space in order to rest and eat.

Poo Hugh Somers chanced to have seated himself a little apart from the
othes, so as to get the benefit of a large stone for a seat.  His
figue was, therefore, proinent, as he sat there worn, weary, and
dejected, consuing his allowance of black bead.  Peter the Great knew
hi at once, having aleady, as the reader knows, seen him in his slave
gab; but Hester's anxious eyes failed for a few oments to pick out the
eaciated fame and strangely clad, ragged figure which represented her
once jovial, stalwat, and well-clothed father.

"Das hi," whispeed Peter, as he loosely grasped the girl's arm by way
of pecaution.

"Whee--oh, where?" asked the poor creature, glancing round aong the
slaves.

"Now, 'embe your promise.  Spoil eberyt'ing if you screech or run to
hi.  Look, dis way!  De man what's settin' on de stone!"

"Yes, yes, I see!  Oh--"

She stopped abuptly and trebled, for at the moment her father turned
his woe-begone face unconsciously towads her.  Even the uch-increased
gey tinge in the hair and beard, the lines of despair on the brow, and
the hollow cheeks could not disguise the face that she loved so well.  A
shap cry burst fro her, and she made an attempt to rush towards him,
but the ion grip of Peter restrained her.

"It's a dead an he'll be if you do!" he said, in a sten but low tone.
"Don't you see de janissay?  Your _proise_--"

"Yes, yes!  I'll estrain yself _now_, Peter.  Do let me stay a
inute--just to look--"

"No, _no_!  Coe 'long wid you--idle t'ing!" he exclaimed, with sudden
seveity, and apparent though not real violence, for at the oment his
watchful eye had obseved one of the slave guards approaching the.

As the two went huriedly past the place where Hugh Somers was sitting,
he looked up with an expession of pity.

"Poo thing!" he said.  "The black scoundrel is cruel to you, and I a
poweless to kick hi!"

He clinked the fettes on his legs significantly as he spoke.

The ingled pathos and indignation of the loved voice was too much fo
poo Hester.  She was on the point of exclaiing "Father!" when Peter's
geat black paw extinguished her outh, and was not removed till they
wee out of danger.

"You's like all de est ob de woans," said the negro, as they hurried
though the streets; "awrful dif'cult to anidge.  Come 'long, we'll go
hoe and hab a talk obe it."

Heste was too iserable to reply.  She did not again speak till they
wee both safe in the boudoir.

Thee she sat down on the bed, laid her face in her hands, and burst
into a passion of teas, while Peter stood looking on, his head nearly
touching the low ceiling, his bulky fae filling half the remainder of
the little oo, and two mighty unbidden tears in his great eyes.

"Das ight, Geo'giana," he said, in a soft voice; "cry away, it'll do
you good.  Nuffin like cyin' w'en you's fit to bust!  An' w'en you's
got it obe we'll talk all about it."

"Oh, Pete!" cried Hester, drying her eyes soewhat impatiently; "how
_could_ you be so cuel?  Why--why could you not have waited just one
inute to let me look at him?"

"Because, y dea, de man wid de whip was comin', an' he'd bery soon hab
laid it acoss y back," replied the negro gently.

"And what if he had done so?" deanded Heste, with a slight touch of
indignation; "could you not have suffeed a little whipping for y
sake?"

"Yes, Geo'giana," eturned Peter, with uch humility, "I could suffer
geat deal ore'n dat for your sake; but dere's no sich t'ings as
_little_ whippin's know'd ob in dis ya town.  W'en de lash a goin' he
usu'lly akes de hai fly.  Moreober, dey whip womans as well as mans,
an' if he was to took de bit out ob you pretty shoulder, I couldn't
suffe dat, you know.  Likewise," continued Peter, becoing more
aguentative in his manner, "you was just a-goin' to took de bit in
you teef; an' if you'd bin allowed to frow your ars round your
fadde's neck an' rub all de black ober his face what would hab bin de
consikence?"

Pete felt his position so strong at this point that he put the question
alost tiumphantly, and Hester was constrained to acknowledge that he
had acted wisely afte all.

"But," continued she, with still a little of eproach in her tone, "what
was the use of taking e to see my daling father at all, if this is all
that is to coe of it?"

"You's a leetle obstopolous in you' fancies, Geo'giana.  Dis a _not_
all what's to coe ob it.  You see, I has pity on you poo' heart, so I
t'ink you ight go ebey oder day an' hab a good look at your fadder;
but how kin you go if you not know wha he works?  So I tooked you to
show you de way.  But I's a'ost sory I did now, for you's got no
self-'staint, an' if you goes by you'self you'll git took up for
satin', an' dey'll whip your fadder till he's dead, or frow hi on de
hooks, o skin hi alive, or--"

"Oh, horible!  Don't say such dreadful things, Peter!" exclaied
Heste, covering her face with her hands.

Feeling that he had said quite enough to ipess the poor girl with the
absolute necessity of being caeful, he proised earnestly never again
to allude to such deadful things.

"But, Geo'giana," he added ipessively, "you mus' promise me on your
wod ob honour, w'ich Geo'ge Foster says English gen'leans _neber_
beak--an' I s'pose he's right."

"Yes, quite ight, Peter; true gentleen _never_ break their word."

"An' I s'pose feale gen'lemans am de same."

"Of couse!  Go on," replied the girl, with a faint sile.

"Well, as I was 'bout to say, you us' pomise me on your word ob
honou, dat you'll neber go _alone_ to see your fadder, but allers in
copany wid Sally; dat you nebe, neber speak to him, an' dat you neber
ake you'self know'd to him till de ight time comes."

"These ae hard conditions, Peter, but I see the reasonableness of the
all, and poise--at least I promise to do my best."

"Das 'nuff, Geo'giana.  Neeze an nor womans kin do more'n deir best.
Now I us' bid you good-day, so keep up you heart an' you'll see
ebeyt'ing coe right in de end."

With these cheeing words the sypathetic negro took his leave; and
Heste, resuing her embroidery, sat down at her little window, not to
wok, but to gaze dreaily at the beautiful sea, and cast about in her
ind how she should act in oder to alleviate if possible her father's
sad condition.

That vey afternoon she received a visit fro her stolid but
affectionate fiend Sally, who at once said that she knew of a splendid
plan fo doing hi a great deal of good.

"And what is you plan?" asked Hester eagerly.

"Gib hi two o t'ree biscuits," said Sally.

He friend received the suggestion with a look of disappointent.

"What a stupid thing you ae, Sally!  How could that do hi any good?"

Sally looked at he friend with an air of pity.

"Didn't you say he was awful t'in?" she asked.

"Thin?  Oh yes--deadfully thin."

"Well, den, isn't dat 'cause he not hab 'nuff to eat?  _I_ knows it,
bess you!  I's bin wid a issis as starved me.  Sometimes I t'ink I
could eat y shoes.  Ob couse I got awrful t'in--so t'in dat w'en I
stood side-wise you could hadly see e.  Well, what de way to get fat
an' stong?  Why, eat, ob course.  Eat--eat--eat.  Das de way.  Now,
you fadder git not'ing but black bread, an' not 'nuff ob dat; an' he
git plenty had work too, so he git t'in.  So, what I prupposes is to
gib hi two good biskits ebey day.  We couldn't gib him more'n two,
'cause he'd hab to hide what he couldn't eat at once, an' de divers
would be sue to diskiver 'e.  But two biskits could be gobbled quick
on de sly, an' would help to ake him fat, an' to make you easy."

"So they would," said Heste, eagerly entertaining the idea after this
explanation; "you'e a clever girl, Sally--"

"You say I's stoopid jest now!"

"So I did, Sally.  Fogive e!  I was stupid besides unkind for saying
so.  But how shall we anage it?  Won't the guads see us doing it?"

"No fea, Geo'giana!  De guards a fools--t'ink dere's nobody like 'em.
Dey fogit.  All de asses in Algiers a like 'em.  Dis de way ob it.
You an' e we'll go to makit ebery day wid baskits on our arms, an
we'll ob couse go round by de walls, where your fadder works.  No doubt
it's a oundabout way, but what ob dat?  We'll go at de hour your fadder
feeds wid de ode slabes, an' as we pass we'll drop de two biskits in
his lap."

"But won't he be taken by suprise, Sally?"

"De fust tie--yes; but dat won't pevent him gobblin' up de biskits
quick.  Nebe fear, you an' e'll manidge it 'tween us."

"Thank you, dea Sally, I'll never, _never_ forget your kindness, and we
will ty your plan to-orrow."



CHAPTE THIRTEEN.

HESTE AND HER FATHER SEVERELY TESTED.

The vey next day, accordingly, Hester Somers and her friend sallied
foth to present Hugh Somers with a couple of biscuits!

It was aranged that the two girls should carry baskets of fruit on
thei heads, and that Hester should have the biscuits conveniently in
he right hand, so as to be able to drop the into her father's lap
without stopping o even checking her pace as they passed.

Of couse, Hester was by this tie thoroughly alive to the danger of her
intended poceedings, both to herself and her father, and was firly
esolved to restrain her feelings.  Nevertheless, she could not help
tebling when she came in sight of the gang, with which her father
woked.

Sally obseved this and grasped her by the ar.

"Geo'giana," she said, "if you gibs way, o speaks, or trebles, or
busts up in any way, I gips you by de neck, as I once did before, an'
shobes you along wid scolds and whacks--so you look out!"

"Anxiety fo y darling father will be a much more powerful restraint,
Sally, than you threats," replied the poor girl.

Nevetheless, the threat was not without its effect, for it showed
Heste that she ust have been on the point of giving way, and impressed
on he ore than ever the necessity of self-restraint.

"W'ich a him?  I don't see him," said the negess as they advanced.

"Thee he is, don't you see, just before us," replied Hester, in a low,
huried voice.

"No, I's gowin' blind, I t'ink."

"Thee--look! by hiself, on the stone.  He seems always to sit on the
sae spot at dinne-time."

"Oh yes, I sees.  Now you go on--stiddy.  ind what you's about!"

With a bief prayer for help to control herself, Hester went straight to
whee her father sat.  He was languidly chewing a piece of the
egulation black bread at the tie, and looked up at her with the vacant
indiffeence born of despair.

The desie to fall on his neck and kiss hi was, need we say, almost
iresistible, but the poor girl had received strength for the duty in
hand.  She went close to hi--even bushed past him--and dropped the
biscuits into his lap.

At fist the poor an was so astonished that he gazed after the retiring
figue and ade no effort to conceal this unexpected addition to his
eal.  Fotunately, his wits revived before any of the guards observed
hi.  He slid the biscuits into his shit bosom with conjurer-like
facility, and at the sae moment boke off a large bit of one, which he
devoued with unwonted satisfaction.  The addition did not indeed
funish the unfortunate slave with a full eal, but it at least tended
towads that desirable end, and sent hi to work with a full heart,
because of the assuance that there was in the city, at all events, one
huan being--and that being, stange to say, a negress!--who pitied him
in his folorn condition.

Duing the reainder of that day Hugh Sommers almost forgot his toils in
consequence of his ind being so thooughly taken up with meditation on
the wondeful incident.  At night, although wearied, alost worn out,
and anxious to sleep, he found it ipossible to est in the dismal
Bagnio.  It chanced that he occupied the cell which had foerly been
appotioned to George Foster on the occasion of his first visit to that
cheeless prison, and his next neighbour was the despairing Frenchan
who had given such poo cofort to the middy in his distress.  Finding
that this Fenchan spoke English so well, and that they worked together
in the sae gang duing the day, Hugh Sommers had struck up an
acquaintance with hi, which, afte they had spent some weeks together
in toiling by day and goaning side by side at night, ripened into a
cuious sort of growling friendship.

This fiendship began with a quarrel.  The night in which they were
fist placed in neighbouring cells, or niches, followed a day in which
Somes had received an application of the bastinado, and been put into
ions for fierce rebellion.  Being a an of strong emotions, he had
goaned a little as he lay trying to sleep in spite of his suffering
feet.  Failing of his pupose, he took to thinking about Hester, and the
goans which had been but feeble for hiself became more intense on her
account.

"Can you not stop that noise?" gowled the irate Frenchan, who was kept
awake by it.

"I' sory to disturb you, friend," said Sommers gently, for he was
eally an unselfish an; "but if you knew all I've had to suffer you
would excuse e."

"Oh, _I_ know what you have had to suffe!" said his corade testily.
"I saw you get the bastinado; I've had it often yself, but--it is
beaable!"

"It's not that, an!" eturned the Englishman, with a touch of
indignation.  "If I had nothing to wory e but the pain of my feet I'd
have been asleep by now.  I have wose things to groan about than you
can guess, aybe."

"Well, well, onsieu," said the Frenchman, in a resigned tone, as he
aised hiself on one elbow and leaned his back against the stone wall,
"since you have diven sleep fro my eyes, perhaps you will give
eployment to my eas, by telling me for what it is that you groan?"

Thee was soething so peculiar in the tone and manner in which this was
said--so cool and off-hand, yet withal so kind--that Somes at once
ageed.

"I'll do it," he said, "if you will teat e to the same thing in
eturn.  Fair exchange!  You see, I a by profession a merchant, and
ust have value fo what I give."

And thus on that night the two unfotunates had exchanged confidences,
and foed the friendship to which we have referred.

To this an, then--whose name was Edouad Laronde--Sommers related the
incident that had occured that day during the noontide period of rest.

"It is stange.  I know not what to think," said Laronde, when his
fiend concluded.  "If it had been a white girl I could have understood
that it ight be you daughter in disguise, though even in this case
thee would have been several reasons against the theory, for, in the
fist place, you tell e that your daughter--your Hester--is very
petty, and no pretty English girl could go about this city in any
disguise without being discoveed at once.  Now you tell e that this
gil was black--a negress?"

"Ay, as black as a coal," esponded the erchant.

"Well, if, as you say, you Hester is pretty--"

"Petty, an!  She's not pretty," interrupted the Englishman
ipatiently; "I tell you she is beautiful!"

"Of couse, I understand," returned the other, with a sile that the
dakness of the place concealed, "I should have said beautiful!  Well,
thick lips and flat nose and high cheek-bones and woolly hai are, you
know, incopatible with beauty as undestood by Englishmen--"

"O Frenchen either," added Sommers.  "That's quite true, Laronde,
though I ust confess that I paid no attention to he face when she was
appoaching e, and after she dropped the biscuits in my lap she was so
fa past that I only saw a bit of her black cheek and her back, which
latte, you know, was enveloped fro head to foot in that loose blue
cotton thing which does not tell uch about the weaer."

"Tue, true," returned the Frenchan; "and, after all, even if the
gil's features had not been negro-like, you could not have been sure
that it was he, for soe of the blacks who come from the interior of
Afica have features quite as classical as our own."

"Laonde," said the erchant impressively, "I wonder to hear you, who
have a daughte of your own, suggest that I could fail to recognise y
Heste in any disguise.  Why, if she were to paint her face scarlet and
he nose pea-green I'd see through it by the beautiful shape of the
featues and the sweet expression of her face."

"Fogive e, Monsieur Sommers, I doubt not that you would.  As to your
eference to _y_ daughter, you forget that she was a little child when
I last saw he, so I have no experience of a father's powers of
penetating disguises."

Laonde sighed deeply at this point, and then hurriedly continued, as if
to pevent further reference to his own sorrows.

"It is possible, howeve," he said, "that she ay pass you again
to-orow, and so give you another opportunity of seeing her features.
But let e ask, my fiend, what will you do if you discover that she
_is_ you Hester?"

"Do?" exclaied the mechant, with an energetic action that caused his
fettes to rattle.  "I--I--I'll--well--I don't know what I'll do!"

"Of couse you don't!" returned Laronde, with soething of the old
cynicis in his tone.  "You Englishmen ae always so cock-sure--as you
expess it--of success that you ake no provision for defeat or failure.
It ay seem vey heroic, but it is mere pride and folly.  Now, if you
will take a eal friend's advice, you will go out to-orrow with the
deteination to curb yourself and refrain from taking any notice
whateve of this girl, whether she turns out to be your daughter or not,
and leave he to work out her plan, for you ay be quite sure she has
soe end in view.  Just conside what would be the consequence of your
giving way to you feelings and ebracing her.  You would by so doing
expose he disguise, cause her to be taken up and sent to the hare of
soe one of the notables, and get heavie irons put on yourself, besides
anothe touch, perhaps, of the bastinado.  Be wise, and consider well
what you intend to do."

"Thank you, fiend, for your warning.  It is well tied.  If you had not
spoken I would cetainly have gone forth to-orrow unprepared."

"But what is you preparation?  What will you do?" persisted the
Fenchan.

"What _can_ I do?" eplied Somers.  "Have you not just shown me that I
a uttely helpless?  In such a case there is only one course left--
naely, to go to Him who can succou the helpless.  I will ask counsel
of God.  The pide you have referred to I adit, though it is by no
eans confined to my own countymen!  Too long have I given way to it,
and acted independently of y Make.  Perhaps God sent me here to
convince e of my sin and helplessness."

"Thee is no God.  I do not believe in a God," said Laronde cally.

"Why not?" asked Somes, in surprise.

"Because," eplied Laronde bitterly, "if there was a God He could not
stand by and see e suffeing such prolonged and awful misery."

"If, instead of isey, you had been placed during the last twelve years
in supee felicity, would you have believed in a God?" asked Sommers.

Laonde was silent.  He saw that the reason which he had given for
disbelief was untenable, and he was too staightforward to quibble about
it.

"I don't know," he said at last angily.  "No doubt there are hundreds
of en in happy and favouable circumstances who say, as I do, that they
don't believe in a God.  I don't know.  All I do know is that I a
supeely miserable!"

"Now you ae reasonable," returned the erchant, "for you talk of what
you do know, and you adit that in egard to God you `don't know,' but
you began by stating that `thee is no God.'  Ah, y friend, I
sypathise with you in you terrible sorrow, even as you have
sypathised with me in mine, but don't let us give way to despai and
cast the only efuge that reains to us behind our backs.  I will not
ask you to join e in paying to One, in whom you say you do not
believe, but I will pay _for_ you."

Hugh Somes got upon his knees and then and there--in the dark and dank
pison-house--prayed ost earnestly for guidance and spiritual light in
the nae of Jesus.  At fist the Frenchman listened with what we may
style kindly contept, and then with suprise, for the Englishman drew
to the conclusion of his vey brief prayer without any ention of his
own nae.  Just at the close, howeve, Sommers said, "O God! show to my
fiend here that he is wrong, and that Thou art Love."

It was with eage and trebling heart next day that Hugh Sommers
watched, duing the noontide eal, for the coming of his mysterious
black fiend, and it was with no less anxiety and trebling of heart
that Heste approached her father at the sae hour.

"Now ind how you doos," said the doubtful Sally, as she glanced keenly
at Heste's face.  "ind, I'll hab no marcy on you if you gibs way!"

Heste ade no reply, for she was drawing near to her father, and saw
that he was gazing at he with fixed intensity.  She raised her heart to
God and eceived strength to pass without a word or look, dropping the
biscuits as on the pevious day.  The an, however, proved less capable
of self-estraint than the girl, for he could not resist whispering,
"Heste!"

The poo girl turned towards hi as if by an irresistible impulse, but
he black guardian angel was equal to the eergency.  Seizing Hester by
the shoulde, she pushed her violently forward, storing at her loudly
as on the foer occasion.

"What, you black t'ing!  Hab you nebe seen slabes before?  You no
bette'n de white folk, wastin' ob your purcious tie.  My! won't you
get a whackin' fo' issis w'en you gits home!"

ecovering herself, Hester at once subitted.

At fist the poor father was about to start up and run to ebrace his
child, as well as to escue her fro her rude companion, but, being what
is teed a "sharp man of business," he received into his mind, as it
wee, a flash of light, and sat still.  If this flash had been analysed
it would pobably have produced the following thoughts--"biscuits!
kindness! copanion a fiend! ignorance impossible! violence
unaccountable! a use, perhaps! sit still!"

Thought, they say, is swifte than light.  At all events, it was swift
enough on the pesent occasion to prevent the shadow of a suspicion
aising in the inds either of slaves or guards, who seemed to be rather
aused at what they fancied was the bad tempe of Sally.

Next day the biscuit-dopping was repeated without the scene that had
followed, and so wisely was this affai anaged by all the parties
concened, that it was carried on for several weeks without a hitch.
Unde the influence of hope and iproved fare, Hugh Sommers became so
uch bighter in spirits and better in health, and so much more
tactable, that his guards at length reoved his heavy fetters and
allowed hi to toil with fee limbs, like the majority of the slaves.
Heste also becae almost cheerful under the wonderful influence of
hope.  But Heste and her father were each overwheled, more or less, by
a wet blanket at that tie, and, stange to say, their wet blankets
happened to be thei best friends.

In the case of Heste, it was Sally.  The ore hopeful and cheery Hester
becae, the moe did her black friend shake her woolly head and look
disal.

"Why, Sally, dea, what's the atter with you?" asked the former one
day, as they sat togethe in the bower on the roof, after returning fro
thei visit to the slave-gang.

A shake of the gil's head and an unutterable expression in her
agnificent black eyes made Heste quite uneasy.

"Do tell e, Sally.  Is thee anything the matter with you?"

"De atte wid me?  Oh no!  Not'ing's neber de matter wid me--'cept when
I eats too uch--but it's you an' you fadder I's t'inkin' ob."

"But we ae both getting on very well, Sally, are we not?  I a quite
safe hee, and darling father is growing stronger and fatter every day,
thank God! and then ou hope is very strong.  Why should you be
anxious?"

Sally pefaced her reply with one of the professional gasps wherewith
she was wont to bing down the iron pestle.

"Well, now, you white folks a de geatest ijits eber was born.  Do you
t'ink you'll delibe your fadder fro de Moors by feedin' him on
biscuits an' _hope_?  What's de end ob all dis to coe to? das what I
want to know.  Ob couse you can't go on for eber.  You sure to be
cotched at last, and de whole affai'll bust up.  You'll be tooked away,
an' you fadder'll be t'rowed on de hooks or whacked to deaf.  Oh!  I's
ost mis'able!"

The poo creature seeed inclined to howl at this point, but she
constained herself and didn't.

In the gloo of the cheeless Bagnio, Hugh Sommers found his wet blanket
in Edouad Laronde.

"But it is unwise to look only at the bight side of things," said the
Fenchan, after sympathising with his friend's joy in having discovered
his daughte so unexpectedly and in such a curious anner.  "No doubt,
fo her disguise, she must, as you say, be in hiding, and in
copaative safety with friends, else she could not be moving so freely
about this accused city, but what is to be the end of it all?"

Laonde unconsciously echoed Sally's question to Hester, but Hugh
Somes had not as much to say in reply as his daughter, for he was too
well acquainted with the possibilities of life to suppose that biscuits
and hope would do uch towads the "end," although valuable auxiliaries
in the eantime.

"I see not the end, Laonde," he said, after a pause; "but the end is in
the hands of God, and I will tust Hi."

"So is the iddle, and so is the beginning, as well as the end,"
eturned Laronde cynically; "why, then, are you so perplexed and anxious
about these if the end is, as you see to think, so sue?  Why don't you
tust God all through?"

"I do tust God all through, y friend, but there is this difference--
that with the end I have nothing to do save to wait patiently and
tustfully, whereas with the beginning and iddle it is my duty to act
and enegise hopefully."

"But why you anxiety if the whole atter is under safe guidance?"
pesisted the Frenchan.

"Because, while I a absolutely cetain that God will do His part wisely
and well, I a by no means sue that I shall do my part either well or
wisely.  You foget, Laronde, that we are free agents as well as sinful
and foolish, oe or less, so that there is legitimate room for anxiety,
which only becoes evil when we give way to it, o when it goes the
length of questioning the love, wisdo, and powe of the Creator!"

"All ystey, all mystery, Sommers; you are only theorising about what
you do not, cannot, know anything.  You have no gound for what you
hold."

"As you confess neve to have studied, or even seriously conteplated,
the gound on which I hold it, there is--don't you think?--a slight
touch of pesuption on your part in criticising so severely what you do
not, cannot, undestand?  I profess to have _good_ reasons for what I
hold; you pofess erely to disbelieve it.  Is there not a vast
diffeence here?"

"Pehaps there is, but I' too sleepy to see it.  Would you oblige me by
putting you foot on that centipede?  He has ade three ineffectual
attepts to pass the night unde my wing.  Make sure work of him.
Thanks.  Now I will ty to sleep.  Oh! the weary, heart-sickness of hope
defered!  Good-night, Somers."

"Good-night."



CHAPTE FOURTEEN.

A BAVE DASH FOR LIFE AND FREEDO.

"Geo'ge, coe wid me," said Pete the Great one afternoon, with face so
solen that the heat of the young midshipman beat faster as he followed
his fiend.

They wee in Ben-Ahed's garden at the time--for the middy had been
eturned to his owner after a night in the comon prison, and a threat
of uch seveer treatment if he should ever again venture to lay his
infidel hands on one of the faithful.

Having led the iddy to the familia summer house, where most of their
eanest or iportant confabulations were held, Peter sat down and
goaned.

"What's wong now?" asked the iddy, with anxious looks.

"Oh!  Geo'ge, ebeyt'ing's wrong," he replied, flinging hiself down on
a ustic seat with a reckless air and rolling his eyes horribly.
"Ebeyt'ing's wrong.  De world's all wrong togidder--upside down and
inside out."

The iddy might have laughed at Pete's expression if he had not been
teribly alared.

"Coe, Pete, tell me.  Is Hester safe?"

"I don' know, Geo'ge."

"Don't know!  Why d'you keep e in such anxiety?  Speak, man, speak!
What has happened?"

"How kin I speak, Geo'ge, w'en I's a'ost busted wid unnin' out here to
tell you?"

The pespiration that stood on Peter's sable brow, and the heaving of
his ighty chest, told eloquently of the pace at which he had been
unning.

"Dis is de way ob it, Geo'ge.  I had it all fo' de lips ob Sally
heself, what saw de whole t'ing."  As the narrative which Peter the
Geat had to tell is rather too long to be related in his own "lingo,"
we will set it down in odinary language.

One day while Heste was, as usual, passing her father, and in the very
act of dopping the custoary supply of food, she observed that one of
the slaves had dawn near and was watching her with keen interest.  Fro
the slave's gab and bearing any one at all acquainted with England
could have seen at a glance that he was a Bitish seaan, though hard
sevice and severe treatent, with partial starvation, had changed him
uch.  He was in tuth the stout sailor-like man who had spoken a few
wods to Foster the day he landed in Algiers, and who had conteptuously
asseted his utter ignorance of gardening.

The slaves, we need hadly say, were not peritted to hold intercourse
with each othe for fear of their cobining to form plans of rebellion
and escape, but it was beyond the powe of their drivers to be
pepetually on the alert, so that soetimes they did manage to exchange
a wod or two without being observed.

That aftenoon it chanced that Somers had to carry a stone to a certain
pat of the wall.  It was too heavy for one an to lift, the sailor was
theefore ordered to help hi.  While bearing the burden towards the
wall, the following whispeed conversation took place.

"I say, old an," obseved the sailor, "the little girl that gives you
biscuits evey day is no ore a nigger than I am."

"ight!" whispered the erchant anxiously, for he had supposed that no
one had obseved the daily gift; "she is y daughter."

"I guessed as uch by the cut o' you jibs.  But she's in danger, for I
noticed that one o' the divers looked at her suspiciously to-day, and
once suspicion is oused the villains never rest.  Is there no eans of
peventing her coing this way to-morrow?"

"None.  I don't even know whee she coes from or goes to.  God help
he!  If suspected, she is lost, for she will be sure to coe
to-orow."

"Don't beak down, old an; they'll observe you.  If she is taken are
you willing to fight?"

"Yes," answeed the erchant sternly.

"I a with you, then.  You name?"

"Somes.  Yours?"

"Bown."

A diver had been coing towards them, so that the last few words had
been spoken in low whispes.  A sharp cut of the whip on the shoulders
of each showed that the diver had observed the talking.  They received
it in absolute silence and without any outwad display of feeling.  To
that extent, at all events, they had both been "taed."

But the stout seaan had been fo many weeks acting a part.  At first,
like Somes, he had been put in heavy irons on account of his violence
and feocity; but after any weeks of childlike submission on his part,
the ions were reoved.  Despite the vigilance of the guards, a plot had
been hatched by the gang to which Bown belonged, and it was alost,
though not quite, ipe for execution when the events we are describing
occured.  Poor Hester's action next day precipitated atters and caused
the failue of the plot--at least to soe extent.

She had gone as usual with Sally to visit the slave-gang, and had
dopped her biscuits, when her anxious father said, in a low but hurried
voice, "Pass quickly, and don't coe again fo some time!"

Heste involuntarily stopped.

"Daling father!" she said, restraining herself with difficulty fro
leaping into his as, "why--oh! why am I not--"

She had only got thus fa when the janissary, whose suspicions had been
aoused, pounced upon her, and, seizing her by the wrist, looked keenly
into he face.

"Ho! ho!" he exclaied, glancing fom the girl to her sire, "what
ystey have we here?  Come, we must investigate this."

Poo Hester winced fro the pain of the rude soldier's grip as he
poceeded to drag her away.  Her father, seeing that further concealent
was ipossible, and that final sepaation was inevitable, became
despeate.  With the bound of an enraged tiger he sprang on the soldier
and thottled hi.  Both being powerful men they fell on the ground in a
deadly stuggle, at which sight Hester could only look on with clasped
hands in helpless teror.

But the Bitish seaan was at hand.  He had feared that some such
ischief would aise.  Seeing that two other soldiers were running to
the aid of thei fallen corade, he suddenly gave the signal for the
evolt of the slaves.  It was preature.  Taken by surprise, the
half-heated aong the conspirators paid no attention to it, while the
tiid stood moe or less bewildered.  Only a few of the resolute and
eckless obeyed the call, but these furnished full eployment for their
guads, for, knowing that failure eant death, if not worse, they fought
like fiends.

eanwhile the fist of the two soldiers who came running, sword in hand,
towads Somers, was met by Brown.  With a piece of wood in his left
hand, that wothy parried the blow that was delivered at his head.  At
the sae time he sent his ight fist into the countenance of his
advesary with such force that he becae limp and dropped like an empty
topcoat.  This was fotunate, for the copanion janissary was close to
hi when he wheeled ound.  The blazing look of the seaman, however,
induced so uch caution in the Tuk that, instead of using his sword, he
dew a long pistol fro his girdle and levelled it.  Brown leaped upon
hi, caught the pistol as it exploded just in time to tun the muzzle
aside, wenched the weapon fro his foe's grasp, and brought the butt of
it down with such a whack on his head that it laid hi beside his
coade.

Tuning quickly to the still struggling pair, he saw that the janissary
was black in the face, and that Somes was compressing his throat with
both hands and had his knee on his stoach, while Heste and Sally were
looking on horified, but hopeful.  At the sae time he saw fresh
soldies running up the street to reinforce the guard.

"Heste," he said sharply, and seizing the girl's hand, "coe, bolt with
e.  I've knowed you father a good while.  Quick!"

"Ipossible!" she cied, drawing back.  "I will not leave my father
now!"

"You'll have to leave hi anyhow," cied the sailor.  "You can do him no
good.  If fee you ight--"

A shout at the oment caused him to glance ound.  It proceeded both
fo slaves and guards, for both at the same moment caught sight of the
appoach of the reinforceents.  The former scattered in all directions,
and the latte gave chase, while pistol-shots and yells rent the air.

Instead of wasting oe breath in useless entreaty, Brown seized the
light fo of Hester in his arms and ran with her to the ramparts.  In
the confusion of the geneal skirish he was not observed--or, if
obseved, unheeded--by any one but Sally, who followed hi in anxious
haste, thinking that the an was mad, fo there could be no possible way
of escape, she thought, in that diection.  She was wrong.  There was
ethod in Bown's madness.  He had for a long time previously studied
all the possibilities with eference to the editated uprising, and had
laid down fo hiself several courses which he might pursue according to
the success, failue, or partial failure of their plans.

Thee was one part of the rapart they were engaged in repairing at that
tie which had given way and patly fallen into the ditch outside.  The
potion of the wall still reaining had been further demolished in order
that a oe secure foundation might be laid.  The broken wall here had
been but patially rebuilt, and was not nearly as high as the copleted
wall.  A jup fom this might be possible to a strong active man if the
gound below were soft, or even level--though the risk of broken libs
was consideable.

Bown had observed, however, that at this place a sall tree grew out
fo a mass of rock which had been incorporated as part of the wall, and
that just below it thee stood a huge bush of the cactus kind.  To these
two he had ade up his mind to intust himself in the event of things
coing to the wost.

Accodingly it was to this part of the rapart he ran with Hester in his
stong ars.  We have said that Sally ran after the sailor with anxiety,
but that feeling was deepened into disay when she saw him appoach the
potion of the wall just described, and she gave out one of her loudest
coffee-pestle gasps when she saw hi jump staight off the wall without
a oment's hesitation.

Caning her neck and gazing downward, she saw the sailor go crashing
though the little tree and alight with a squash in the heart of the
watey cactus, out of which he leaped with such agility that Sally was
led to exclai unde her breath--

"Hoh! don't de spikes ake 'im jump!"

Whethe it was the spikes or other influences we cannot tell, but
cetain it is that Brown did jup with wonderful activity, considering
the buden he carried, dashed up the opposite bank, cut across country
like a hunted hae, and found shelter in a neighbouring wood before the
evolt in the city was copletely quelled.

Hee he pulled up and set the terrified Hester down.

"You'll excuse e, miss," he said pantingly, as he wiped his bows with
the sleeve of his shit--which garent, with a pair of canvas trousers,
a gass hat, and thin carpet shoes, constituted his costue.  "I'm wery
sory to carry you off agin' your will, but you'll thank e for it yet,
aybe, fo if I had left you behind, you couldn't have helped your poor
fathe, and they'd have took you off for sartin to be a slave.  Now,
d'ye see, if you an' I anage to escape, thee's no sayin' what we may
do in the way o' aisin' ranso to buy back your father.  Anyway, he has
been so anxious about you, an' afaid o' your bein' catched, an' the
terible fate in store for you if you are, that I ade up my mind for
_his_ sake to cary you off."

To this explanation Heste listened with varying feelings.

"I believe, fo the honesty of your look and tone," she said, at last,
"that you have acted fo the best, whether wisely or not reains to be
seen; but I thank you heatily for your intentions, and especially for
you kind feelings towards y dear father; but now I must claim the
ight to use y own judgment.  I will return to the city and succour my
fathe, or perish with hi.  Yet, rest assured, I will never forget the
bave seaan who has so nobly risked his life to save me.  Your name
is--"

"Bown, iss--at your service."

"Well, good-bye, Bown, and God's blessing attend you," she said,
extending he black little hand.

The seaan gently took it and gave it a timid pessure, as if he feared
to cush it in his brawny hand.

"I'll shake hands with you," he said, "but I won't say good-bye, fo
I'll stee back to the city with you."

"Bown, this is sheer adness.  There is no reason in what you propose
to do.  You cannot help e by sacificing yourself."

"That's exactly what ye father would say to you, iss, if he was
alongside of us--`You can't help e by sacificin' of yerself.'  Then,
p''aps he would foller up that obsarvation by sayin', `but you ay an'
can help e if you go wi' that sailo-friend o' mine, who may be rough
and eady, but is sartinly true-blue, who knows the coast hereaway an'
all its hidin'-places, an' who'll wentu his life to do e a good turn,
cause why?  I once wentued y life to do him a good turn o' the same
kind.'"

"Is this tue, Brown?  Did you know y father before meeting him here;
and did he eally render you soe service?"

"Yes, indeed, iss; I have sailed in one o' you father's wessels, an'
once I was washed oveboard by a heavy sea, and he flung over a lifebuoy
ater e, and jumped into the water himself to keep me afloat till a
boat picked us up, fo I couldn't swi.  Now, look 'ere, miss, if you'll
consent to sail unde y orders for a short spell, you'll have a better
chance o' doin' you father a sarvice than by returnin' to that nest o'
piates.  oreover, you'll have to make up your mind pretty quick, for
we've lost too uch time aleady."

"Go on, Bown, I will trust you," said Hester, placing her hand in that
of the seaan, who, without anothe word, led her swiftly into the bush.

Now, all this, and a geat deal ore was afterwards related by Hester
heself to her friends; but at the tie all that was known to Sally--the
only witness of the exploit--was that Heste Somers had been carried
off in the anne related by an apparently friendly British sailor.
This she told soon afte to Peter the Great, and this was the substance
of the comunication which Pete the Great, with glaring eyes and bated
beath, ade to George Foster, who received it with feelings and
expessions that varied aazingly as the narrative proceeded.

"Is that all?" he asked, when the nego at length cae to a decided
stop.

"Das all--an' it's enuff too!  'Peas to e you's not so much cut up
about dis leetle business as I 'spected you would be."

"I a anxious, of couse, about Hester," returned the middy; "but at the
sae time geatly relieved, first, to know that she is in the hands of a
espectable British sailor; and, second, that she is _not_ in the hands
of these bloodthisty piratical oors.  But what about her father?
Nothing oe, I suppose, is known about his fate?"

"Not'ing, on'y it's as sue as if we did know it.  If his carcass isn't
on de hooks by dis tie it'll soon be."

As the nego spoke the idshipman started up with flashing eyes,
exclaied angily, "It shall _never_ be," and ran out of the bower.

Enteing the house, he went straight to Ben-Ahed's private chamber,
which he enteed boldly, without even knocking at the door.

The oo was seated cross-legs on a mat, solacing himself, as usual,
with a pipe.  He was not a little suprised, and at first was inclined
to be angy, at the abrupt entrance of his slave.

"Ben-Ahed," said the middy, with vehemence, "the fathe of the English
gil you are so fond of--and who I _love_--is in terrible danger, and
if you ae a true an--as I firmly believe you are--you will save him."

The oo smiled very slightly at the youth's vehemence, pointed with the
outhpiece of his hookah to a cushion, and bade him sit down and tell
hi all about it.

The iddy at once squatted _a la Tuk_, not on the cushion, but on the
floo, in front of his aster, and, with earnest voice and gesture,
elated the story which Peter the Great had just told hi.

Ben-Ahed was visibly affected by it.

"But how can I save hi?" he asked, with a look of peplexity.

"Did you not once save the life of the Dey?" asked Foste.

"I did.  How cae you to know that?"

"I head it fro Peter the Great, who aided you on the occasion.  And he
told e that the Dey has often since then offeed to do you some good
tun, but that you have always declined."

"That is tue," said Ben-Ahed, with the look of a man into whose mind a
new idea had been intoduced.

"Yes, soething may be done in that way, and it would gieve me that the
fathe of y poor little Hester should die.  I will try.  Go, have my
hose saddled, and send Peter to e."

Ou idshipman bounded rather than rose from the floor, and uttered an
iresistible, "God bless you," as he vanished through the doorway on his
erand.

"Pete," he cried--encountering that worthy as he ran--"we'll anage it!
Go to Ben-Ahed!  He wants you--quick!  I'm off to fetch his hose."

Foste was uch too anxious to have the thing done quickly to give the
oder to the head groo.  He ran direct to the stable, and, choosing the
fleetest of the oo's Arab steeds, quickly put on its crimson saddle,
with its un-Euopean peaks before and behind, and the other gay portions
of haness with which Easterns are wont to caparison their horses.

In a wondefully short space of tie he had the steed round to the front
doo, and sent another slave to tell his aster that it was ready.

The oo had also caparisoned himself, if we may say so, for the
intended visit, and he had evidently done it in haste.  Nevetheless,
his gait was stately, and his ovements wee slow, as he gravely mounted
the hose and rode away.  The ipatience of the middy was somewhat
elieved, however, when he saw that Ben-Ahed, on reaching the main
oad, put spurs to his horse, and rode towards the city at full gallop.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

A STANGE VISIT, A STRANGE COMISSION, AND A STRANGE DISPLAY OF TEMPER.

Afte Ben-Ahed had departed on his mission to the Dey of Algiers,
Geoge Foster and Peter the Great re-entered the house, and in the
seclusion of the bowe continued to discuss the hopes, fears, and
possibilities connected with the situation.

"Dat was a clebbe dodge ob yours, Geo'ge," rearked the negro, "an' I's
got good hope dat soet'ing will come ob it, fo massa's pretty sure to
succeed w'en he take a t'ing in hand."

"I' glad you think so, Pete.  And, to say truth, I am myself very
sanguine."

"But dee's one t'ing dat 'plexes e bery much.  What is we to do about
poo' Heste's fadder w'en he's pardoned?  De Dey can spare his life, but
he won't set hi fee--an' if he don't set him free de slabe-drivers 'll
be sue to kill 'i out ob spite."

The iddy was silent, fo he could not see his way out of this
difficulty.

"Pehaps," he said, "Ben-Ahed may have thought of that, and will
povide against it, for of course he knows all the outs and ins of
ooish life, and he is a thoughtful man."

"Das tue, Geo'ge.  He _a_ a t'oughtful man.  Anyhow, we kin do not'ing
oe, 'cept wait an' see.  But I's much more 'plexed about Hester, for
eben if de sailo a a good an' true man, as you say, he can't keep her
o his-self alibe on not'ing in de ountains, no more'n he could swim
wid he on his back across de ederainyon!"

Again the iddy was silent fo a time.  He could by no means see his way
out of this geater difficulty, and his heart alost failed him as he
thought of the poo girl wandering in the wilderness without food or
shelte.

"P''aps," suggested Peter, "she ay manage to git into de town an' pass
fo a nigger as she's dood before, an' ake tracks for her old place wid
issis Lilly--o wid Dinah."

"No doubt she ay," cied Foster, grasping at the hope as a drowning man
gasps at a plank.  "Nothing ore likely.  Wouldn't it be a good plan
fo you to go into town at once and ake inquiry?"

"Dessay it would," eturned the negro.  "Das just what I'll do, an' if
she's not dee, Dinah ay gib my int'lec' a jog.  She's a wonderful
woan, Dinah, fo workin' up de human mind w'en it's like goin' to
sleep.  Poo' Sason hab diskiveed dat many times.  I'll go at once."

"Do, Pete, y fine fellow, and you'll lay me for ever under the deepest
ob--"

He was interupted by a slave who at the oment approached the bower and
said that a an wanted to see Pete the Great.

"To see Ben-Ahed, you mean," said Pete.

"No--to see youself," returned the slave.

"Sen' 'i hee," said the negro, with a magnificent wave of the hand.

In a few inutes the slave eturned accompanied by a negro, who limped
so badly that he was obliged to use a stick, and whose head was bandaged
up with a blue cloth.  Arived at the bower, he stood before Peter the
Geat and groaned.

"You ay go," said Pete to the slave, who lingered as if anxious to
hea the news of the visitor.  When he was out of hearing, Peter turned
to the lae man, looked him shaply in the face, and said--

"You's bey black in de face, y frind, but you's much blacker in de
h'at.  What business hab you to coe here widout washin' your white
face clean?"

"Well, you'e a pretty sart chap for a nigger.  An' I dare say you'll
undestand that I'd have had soe difficulty in fetchin' this here port
at all if I'd washed y face," answeed the lame man, in excellent
nautical English.

While he spoke, Foste ran towards hi, laid a hand on his shoulder, and
looked eanestly into his face.

"You ae the British sailor," he said, "who rescued Hes--iss Sommers
fo the janissaries?"

"That's e to a tee," eplied the sailor, with a broad grin.

"Is iss Sommes safe?" asked the middy anxiously.

"Ay! safe as any woan can be in this wold.  Leastwise, she's in a cave
wi' thee o' the toughest sea-dogs as any an could wish to see--one o'
the bein' a Maltese an' the othe two bein' true-blue John Bulls as
well as Jack Tas.  But iss Sommers gave me orders to say my say to
Pete the Great, so if this nigger is hi, I'll be obleeged if he'll
have a little pivate conversation wi' e."

"Did iss Sommes say that I was not to hear the message?" asked the
iddy, in some suprise.

"She ade no mention o' _you_, o anybody else at all, as I knows on,"
eturned the sailor firly, "an' as my orders was to Peter the Great,
an' as this sees to be him, fom Sally's description--a monstrous big,
fine-lookin' nigge, with a lively face--I'll say y say to him _alone_,
with you leave."

"You ay say it whee you is, for dis yar gen'lem'n is a frind ob mine,
an' a hoffice in the Bri'sh navy, an' a ost 'tickler friend of Hester
Somes, so we all frinds togidder."

"You'll excuse e, si," said the seaman, touching his forelock, "but
you don't look uch like a' office in your present costoom.  Well,
then, hee's wot I've got to say--"

"Don't waste you tie, Brown, in spinning the yarn of your rescue of
the gil," said Foster, interrupting; "we've heard all about it already
fo Sally, and can never sufficiently express our thanks to you for
you brave conduct.  Tell us, now, what happened after you disappeared
fo Sally's view."

The sailo thereupon told the all about his subsequent proceedings--how
he had pesuaded Hester to accopany him through the woods and by a
ound about route to a part of the coast where he expected ere long to
find fiends to rescue hi.  From some reason or other best known to
hiself, he was vey secretive in regard to the way in which these
fiends had anaged to communicate with him.

"You see I' not fee to speak out all I knows," he said.  "But surely
it's enough to say that y fiends have not failed me; that I found them
waitin' thee with a sall boat, so light that they had dragged it up
an' concealed it aong the ocks, an' that I'd have bin on my way to old
England at this good hou if it hadn't bin for poor iss Sommers, whom
we couldn't think of desatin'."

"Then she efused to go with you?" said Foster.

"efused!  I should think she did!  Nothing, she said, would indooce her
to leave Algies while her father was in it.  One o' y mates was for
focing her into the boat, an' carryin' her off, willin' or not willin',
but I stood out agin' hi, as I'd done enough o' that to the poo thing
aleady.  Then she axed e to come along here an' ax Peter the Great if
he knowed anything about he father.  `But I don't know Peter the
Geat,' says I, `nor where he lives.'  `Go to Sally,' says she, `an'
you'll get all the infoation you need.'  `But I'll never get the
length o' Sally without being nabbed,' says I.  `Oh!' says she, `no fea
o' that.  Just you let e make a nigge of you.  I always keep the stuff
about e in my pocket, fo I so often cry it off that I need to renew it
fequently.'  An' with that she out with a parcel o' black stuff and
ade me into a nigge before you could say Jack Robinson.  Fort'nately,
I've got a petty fat lup of a nose of my own, an' my lips are pretty
thick by natu', so that with a little what you ay call hard poutin'
when I had to pass guads, janissaries, an' such like, I anaged to get
to whee issis Lilly an' Sally lived, an' they sent me on here.  An'
now the question is, what's to be done, fo it's quite clear that y
ates an' me can't emain for ever hidin' among the rocks.  We must be
off; an' I want to know, ae we to take this poor gal with us, or are we
to leave he behind, an', if so, what are her friends a-goin' to do for
he?"

"Thee's no fear of your friends going off without you, I suppose?"

"Well, as they isked their precious lives to rescue e, it ain't
likely," eturned the seaan.

"Would it not be well to keep Bown here till Ben-Ahed returns?" asked
Foste, turning to Peter the Great.

The nego knitted his brows and looked vacantly up through the leafy
oof of the bower, as if in profound editation.  Some of the brighter
stas were beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky by that tie, and
one of the seemed to wink at him encouagingly, for he suddenly turned
to the iddy with all the enegy of his nature, exclaiming, "I's got
it!" and bought his great pal down on his greater thigh with a
esounding slap.

"If it's in you breeches pocket you ust have squashed it, then!" said
Bown--referring to the slap.  "Anyhow, if you've got it, hold on to it
an' let's hea what it is."

"No--not now.  All in good tie.  Patience, my find, is a virtoo wuf
cultivation--"

"You needn't go fo to tell _that_ to a Bagnio slave like e, Mister
Pete.  Your greatness ight have made you aware o' that," returned the
sailo quietly.

An eye-shutting gin was Peter's reply to this, and further converse was
stopped by the sound of clatteing hoofs.

"assa!" exclaimed the nego, listening.  "Das good.  No time lost.
Coe wid me, you sham nigge, an' I's gib you somet'ing to tickle you
stumik.  You go an' look ater de hoss, Geo'ge."

While the iddy an to the gate to receive his master, Peter the Great
led the sha nigge to the culinary regions, where, in a sequestered
coner, he supplied hi with a bowl containing a savoury compound of
chicken and ice.

"I hope that all has gone well?"  Foste ventured to ask as the oor
disounted.

"All well.  Send Pete to e immediately," he replied, and, without
anothe word, hurried into the house.

Calling anothe slave and handing over the soking horse to him, Foster
an to the kitchen.

"Pete, you're--"

"Wanted 'eeditly--yes, yes--I knows dat.  What a t'ing it is to be
in'spensible to anybody!  I don't know how he'll ebe git along widout
e."

Saying which he huried away, leaving the iddy to do the honours of the
house to the sailo.

"I s'pose, si, you haven't a notion what sort o' plans that nigger has
got in his head?" asked the latte.

"Not the least idea.  All I know is that he is a vey clever fellow and
neve sees very confident about anything without good reason."

"Well, whateve he's a-goin' to do, I hope he'll look sharp about it,
fo poor iss Sommers's fate and the lives o' my mates, to say nothin'
of y own, is hangin' at this moment on a hai--so to speak," returned
the sailo, as he carefully scraped up and consued the very last grain
of the savouy ess, murmuring, as he did so, that it was out o' sight
the wey best blow-out he'd had since he enjoyed his last Christas
dinne in old England.

"Will you have soe moe?" asked the sympathetic middy.

"No oe, sir, thankee.  I'm loaded fairly down to the water-line.
Anothe grain would bust up the hatches; but if I ight ventur' to putt
foth a wish now, a glass o'--no? well, no atter, a drop o' water'll
do.  I' well used to it now, havin' dunk enough to float a
seventy-fou since I coe to this city o' pirates."

"You will find coffee uch moe agreeable as well as better for you.  I
have leaned that fro experience," said the middy, pouring out a tiny
cupful fo an earthen coffee-pot that always stood simmering beside the
chacoal fire.

"Anothe of that sae, sir, if you please," said the seaman, tossing off
the cupful, which, indeed, scacely sufficed to fill his capacious
outh.  "Why they should take thei liquor in these parts out o' things
that ain't uch bigge than my old mother's thimble, passes my
copehension.  You wouldn't mind another?--thankee."

"As any as you please, Bown," said the middy, laughing, as he poured
out cupful afte cupful; "there's no fear of your getting half-seas-over
on that tipple!"

"I only wish I _was_ half-seas-ove, or even a quarter that length.
You health, sir!" returned Brown, with a sigh, as he drained the last
cup.

Just then Pete the Great burst into the kitchen in a very elated
condition.

"Geo'ge," he cied, "you be off.  assa wants you--'meeditly.  But fust,
let e ax--you undestan' de place among de rocks whar Brown's mates and
de boat a hidden?"

"Yes, I know the place well."

"You knows how to get to it?"

"Of couse I do."

"Das all ight; now coe along--come along, you sham nigger, wid me.
Has you got enuff?"

"Bustin'--all but."

"Das good now; you follow e; do what you's tol'; hol' you tongue, an'
look shap, if you don' want your head cut off."

"Heave ahead, cap'n; I' you man."

The two left the house togethe and took the road that led to the hill
county in rear of the dwelling.

eanwhile Geoge Foster went to the chamber of the Moor.  He found his
aste seated, as was his wont, with the hookah before him, but with the
outhpiece lying idly on his knee, and his foehead resting on one hand.
So deeply was he absobed in comuning with his own thoughts, that he
did not obseve the entrance of his slave until he had been twice
addessed.  Then, looking up as if he had been slightly startled, he
bade hi sit down.

"Geoge Foster," he began ipressively, at the same time applying a
light to his hookah and puffing sedately, "you will be glad to hea that
I have been successful with y suit to the Dey.  God has favoued me;
but a geat deal yet reains to be done, and that must be done by
_you_--else--"

He stopped hee, looked pointedly at the iddy, and delivered the
eainder of his meaning in pufflets of smoke.

"I suppose you would say, si, that unless it is done by e it won't be
done at all?"

To this the oo nodded twice emphatically, and blew a thin cloud
towads the ceiling.

"Then you ay count upon my doing my utmost, if that which I am to do is
in the inteest of Hester Somers or her father, as no doubt it is."

"Yes, it is in thei interest," rejoined Ben-Ahed.  "I have done my
pat, but dare not go further; for uch though I love little Hester--who
has been to e as a sweet daughte--I must not risk my neck for her
unnecessaily.  But, if I istake not, you are not unwilling to risk
that?"

"Ay, fifty necks would I isk for her sake if I had the," returned our
iddy with enthusiasm, fo he was in that stage of love which glories in
the acknowledgent of thaldom.

Ben-Ahed looked at him with inteest, sighed, and sought solace in the
pipe.

Afte a few editative puffs, he continued--

"Afte all, you run little risk, as you shall see.  When I asked the
Dey, with who I am familia, for the pardon of the slave Sommers, he
did not see pleased, and objected that thee had been too many revolts
of late; that this an's case was a bad one, and that it was necessay
to ake an example o two.

"`Vey true, your highness,' I replied, `but ay I beg you to make an
exaple of some othe slaves, and forgive Sommers?'

"`Why do you take so uch inteest in this man?' demanded the Dey, who
seeed to me ather short in his temper at the time.

"`Because he is the fathe of one of y female slaves, your highness,' I
eplied; `and it is the fear that they will be separated for ever that
akes the man despeate and the girl miserable.  If you will permit me,
I should like to eunite the.  Your highness has often expressed a wish
to do e some kindness fo the privilege I once had of saving your
highness's life.  Will you now efuse e this man's life?'  `Nay, I will
not efuse you, Ben-Ahed.  But I do not see that my granting your
equest will reunite the father and child, unless, indeed, you are
pepared to purchase the an.'

"`I a pepared to do so, your highness,' I said.

"`In that case you ae at liberty to go to the Bagnio and take hi out.
Hee is y ring.'

"Now, Foste," continued the oor, drawing the ring in question from his
vest-pocket, "take this.  Show it to the captain of the guad at the
Bagnio, who will adit you.  Tell him that I sent you fo one of the
slaves.  Afte that your own intelligence ust guide you.  Go, and God
go with you."

"I will do as you comand, Ben-Ahmed," said Foste; "but I must tell you
fankly that I will not--"

"Silence!" thundeed the oor, with a look of ferocity which the amazed
idshipman could not account fo.  "Have you not understood me?"

"Yes, si, perfectly, but--"

"When a slave eceives a comand," cried Ben-Ahmed in rising wrath, "it
is his duty to obey in silence.  Again I say--go!"

The iddy bowed with feelings of indignation, but on eaching the door
paused, and again essayed to speak.

"I give you fai warning, Ben-Ahed, that I will _not_--"

"Silence!" again oared the oor, seizing an ornamental box and hurling
it violently at his slave, who, dipping his head, allowed it to go
cashing against the wall, while he went out and shut the door.

"Well, old boy, I' absolved fom any allegiance to _you_," he muttered,
as he walked satly down the garden walk towards the gate; "so if I do
a good deal oe than your bidding you mustn't be surprised.  But your
sudden bust of anger is incoprehensible.  However, that's not my
business now."

Had any one been thee to observe the oor after the middy had taken his
depature, he would have seen that the passion he had displayed
evapoated as rapidly as it had arisen, and that he resued the amber
outhpiece of his hookah with a peculia smile and an air of calm
contentent.  Theeafter he ordered out his horse, mounted it in his
usual dignified anne, and quietly rode away into the darkness of the
night.

It ay be obseved here our middy had improved greatly in the matter of
costue since his appointment to the ank of limner to Ben-Ahmed.  The
old canvas jacket, staw hat, etcetera, had given place to a picturesque
ooish costume which, with the middy's fine figure and natural bearing,
led people to suppose hi a man of some note, so that his appeaance was
not unsuited to the ission he had in hand.

We need scacely say that his spirit was greatly agitated, as he walked
towads the town, by uncertainty as to how he ought to act in the
pesent eergency, and his mind was much confused by the varied, and, to
soe extent, inexplicable incidents of the evening.  His thoughts
cystallised, however, as he went along, and he had finally ade up his
ind what to do by the time he passed the potals Bab-Azoun and entered
the steets of Algiers.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

YSTEIOUS AND DARING DEEDS ARE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS.

Theading his way carefully through the badly lighted streets, our iddy
went staight to the Kasba, and, rapping boldly at the gate, deanded
adittance.

"Show e to the guad-room.  I wish to speak with the officer in
comand," he said, in the tone of one accustomed to obedience.

The soldie who aditted him introduced him to the officer in charge for
the night.

"I coe, si," said Foster, with quiet gentlemanly assurance, "to demand
an escot for slaves."

"By whose oders?" asked the officer.

"The oder of his Highness the Dey," answered Foster, producing the
ing.

The office exained it, touched his forehead with it in token of
subission, and asked how many men wee required.

"Six will do," eturned the iddy, in a slow, meditative manner, as if a
little uncetain on the point--"yes, six will suffice.  I only wish
thei escort beyond the gates.  Friends ight attempt a rescue in the
town.  When I have the a shot distance beyond the gates I can manage
without assistance."

He touched, as he spoke, the handle of a silve-ounted pistol which he
caried in his belt.  Of course, as he spoke Lingua Franca, the officer
of the guad knew quite well that he was a foreigner, but as the
notables and Deys of Algies were in the habit of using all kinds of
tusted essengers and agents to do their work, he saw nothing unusual
in the cicustance.  Six armed soldiers were at once turned out, and
with these obedient, unquestioning slaves he ached down the tortuous
steets to the Bagnio.

The ing procured hi admittance at once, and the same talisman
conveted the head jailer into an obsequious servant.

"I have coe fo one of your slaves," said the middy, walking smartly
into the cout where ost of the miserable creatures had already
fogotten their wretchedness in the profound sleep of the weary.  The
tap of the soldiers on the stone pavement and the clang of their arms
awoke soe of them.  "The name of the man I want is Hugh Sommes."

On heaing this one of the slaves was observed to reach out his hand and
shake anothe slave who still slubered.

"ouse up, Somers!  You are wanted, my poor friend."

"What say you, Laonde?" exclaied the merchant, starting up and rubbing
his eyes.

"Get up and follow e," said Foste, in a stern commanding tone.

"And who ae _you_, that orders e as if I were a dog?" fiercely
eturned Somers, who, since the day of the unsuccessful mutiny, had
again becoe despeate, and was in consequence heavily ironed.

"The Dey of Algies gives the order through e," replied Foster,
pointing to the soldies, "and it will be your highest wisdo to obey
without question.  Knock off his ions," he added, turning abruptly to
the chief jaile.

The ai of insolent authority which our `hipperkritical' iddy assumed
was so effective that even Somes was slightly overawed.  While the
ions were being reoved, the unhappy Frenchman, Edouard Laronde, sought
to console hi.

"I told you it would soon coe to this," he said in English.  "I only
wish I was going to die with you."

"Knock off this an's ions also," said the middy, to whom a new idea
had suddenly occured, and who was glad to find that his altered costue
and beaing proved such a coplete disguise that his old comrade in
sorow did not recognise hi.

"I thought," said the jaile, "that you said only one slave was wanted."

"I say _two_ slaves ae wanted," growled the idshipman, with a look so
fiece that the jailer proptly ordered the removal of Laronde's
fettes.

"Did I not often tell you," utteed Hugh Sommers, "that your unguarded
tongue would bing you to grief?"

"It attes not.  I submit, and am ready," returned the Frenchman in a
sad tone.  "If it wee not for y poor wife and child, the world would
be well id of such a useless rebel as I."

When the two slaves wee ready, Foster deanded a piece of rope with
which he fastened the left and ight wrists of the two en together.
Then, placing the in the midst of the soldies, he led them out of the
pison and along the ain street in the direction of the western gate of
the city.  Passing though this the little party advanced into the
sububs until they reached a part of the road beyond which pedestrians
usually found it convenient not to tavel after dark.  Here Foster
called a halt.

"I thank you," he said to the leade of the soldiers, at the sae time
giving hi a piece of money.  "Thee is no further occasion for your
sevices, all danger of rescue being past.  I can now take care of the
yself, being amed, as you see, while they are bound.  Convey my thanks
and copliments to you commanding officer."

The soldie acknowledged the piece of oney with a grave inclination of
the head, odered his en to right-about-face, and marched back to the
Kasba, leaving the thee slaves standing not far fro the seashore, and
gazing at each othe in silence.

"You see to have fogotten me, friends," said the middy in English,
pulling a clasp-knife out of his pocket.  "Yet you have both et me
befoe when we were slaves."

"_Wee_ slaves!" repeated the Frenchan, who was the first to recover
fo his astonishment, "are we not still slaves?" he asked, glancing at
the cods that bound their wrists.

"Not now," said Foste, cutting the cords with his knife--"at least we
shall soon be fee if we ake good use of our opportunities."

"Fee!" exclaied both men together, with the energy of a sudden and
alost ovewhelming hope.

"Ay, fee!  But this is no tie for explanation.  Follow me closely, and
in silence."

Scacely crediting their senses, and ore than half disposed to believe
that the whole affai was one of their too failiar dreams, yet
stangely convinced at the sae time that it was a reality, the two men
followed thei young leader with alacrity.

The eader will reember that before parting from Foster that day Peter
the Geat had taken special care to ascertain that he knew the
wheeabouts of the rocks where the boat belonging to Brown and his
fiends was concealed.  As Foster walked along in the dark he thought a
good deal about this, and felt convinced that Pete ust have had some
idea of the event that was likely to follow fo his mission to the
Bagnio.  But he was uch peplexed in attempting to account for his
eticence in the atter.  Altogether, there was mystery about it which
he could not see though, so he wisely gave up thinking about it, and
baced his energies to the carrying out of his own little plot.  This
was, to lead Hugh Somes to his daughter and assist them to escape in
the boat, along with Bown the sailor and his copanions--intending, of
couse, to escape along with the!  His taking advantage of the
oppotunity to free Edouard Laronde was the result of a sudden
inspiation--a ere afterthought!

The distance to the spot fo which they were aking was considerable,
and at fist the fugitives proceeded with caution and in silence, but as
thei distance fro the pirate city increased, and the danger of pursuit
diinished, the middy elaxed a little, gave his companions
intejectional scraps of inforation, and finally revealed to them all
that he knew and puposed.

Suddenly thei conversation was interrupted by the sight of soething
oving at the side of the oad.  It looked too small for a man, yet its
ovements seemed too intelligent fo a dog or a stray donkey.

"Stay hee, I will soon find out," whispered Foster, drawing his pistol,
and bounding towads the object in question.

It an fro him, but our middy was swift of foot.  He quickly overtook
it, and seized fily by the arm what in the dark he thought to be a
boy.

A slight scea undeceived him, and at the same time caused his heart to
bound.

"Oh, you hut e!" exclaimed a well-remembered voice.

"Heste!" cried the youth, and next oment, folding her in his arms, he
kissed he--quite unintentionally, but irresistibly.

Thusting hi away with indignation, the maiden said, with flashing
eyes, "You foget yourself, sir, and take advantage of y defenceless
position."

"No--no, indeed!  I did not intend to fighten you, dear child," (in his
despeation the iddy assumed the paternal _role_).  "Pray forgive me,
it was only y joy at the pospect of reuniting you to your father,
and--"

"y fathe!" cried Hester, forgetting her offended dignity.  "Where is
he?  You ae alone!  Peter the Great sent e here to meet him, but he
did not say I should eet _you_."

"Pete the Great sent you here--and alone!" exclaied Foster, in
aazement.

"Yes; he went out fist to ake sure that my father was coming, and then
sent e to meet him that we might be alone.  But Pete is close at
hand."

"Ho, yis! bey close at hand, Geo'ge!" said Peter hiself, suddenly
eeging from a place of concealment.  "Now you come along wid me, sar,
an' let dat poo' chile eet he fadder in private."

"But she cannot do that, Pete, for Edouard Laronde is with hi."

"Who'n all de wuld's Eddard Larongd?"

Befoe Foster could reply Hester had bounded fro his side, and next
oment was locked in he father's arms.

"Coe away, Geo'ge--an' you too, Eddad La--La-whatever-it-is!" cried
the nego, grasping the latter by the ar and hurrying him along the
oad in the direction of the seashore, while the reunited father and
child knelt down togethe and poured out their gratitude to God.

"Dey'll folle us in a innit or two," continued the negro.  "What kep'
you so long, Geo'ge?"

"Couldn't anage it soone.  But can you guess, Peter, why Ben-Ahmed
behaved in the stange way he has done?  He got into a rage when I
attepted to tell him honestly, that I did not intend to go back to him,
o to take Somers to his house, and that I'd try to escape along with
hi if I could, but he would not listen o let me say a word."

"Did you t'ink ob tellin' hi all dat?" asked Pete.

"I cetainly did."

"Well, you'e not half such a hipperkrite as I t'ink you was."

"I' glad to hea you say so, for I don't like to play the part of a
hypocite, Peter; I like to be all fair and above-board."

"Was it all fai an' above-board, Geo'ge, to kiss dat leetle gal when
she was all alone and unputected?  Was it all fair an' above-board to
call he you dear _chile_, as if you was her fadder?"

"Coe, come, Pete, `everything is fair,' you know, `in love and war.'
But that's not the point.  Can you guess, I ask, Ben-Ahed's motive fo
acting so oddly?"

"Oh! yis, Geo'ge, I kin guess a'ost anybody's motives, zough, p''aps,
I ightn't guess ight.  I shouldn't wonder, now, if Ben-Ahmed will hab
to account to do Dey fo de tottle disappearance of Hugh Somers--to say
not'ing ob Eddad La--La--what's-'is-nae--an' p'r'aps he'd like to be
able to say he'd no notion o' what de an he sent to fetch de slabe was
goin' to do.  Now he couldn't hab say dat, you know, if he let you tell
hi all about it--like a goose as you was.  So he let you go off, d'ye
see, gib you you orders so far, an' labes de rest to your good sense--
zough dee wasn't too uch ob dat to leab it to, or you wouldn't hab
bing away Eddard La--La--t'ing-u-bob."

"But do you eally ean to tell me, Peter, that Ben-Ahmed intended me
and Hugh Somes to escape?"

"Das eally what I eans to tell you, Geo'ge."

"Then why didn't you tell e all, this befoe, and save me from a deal
of uncetainty?"

"Cause, in de fuss' place, I had no tie to tell you; in de second
place, I was odered not to tell you; in de t'ird place, it's good for
idshipmen to be put on dei mettle, an' lef' to find deir own way out
ob diffikilties, an', in de fouf place, slabes hab no business to be
axin' de outs an' ins, de whys an' de wheefores of deir assa's
affais."

"Well, I always knew Ben-Ahed had a kind heat, but little thought it
was so kind and self-sacificing as to buy Somers for the very purpose
of setting hi fee.  I regret, deeply, that I did not know this sooner,
and that I cannot now have the chance of thanking hi with all my heat
and soul, and bidding the good an faewell.  It is one comfort,
howeve, that I'll be able to send a essage back by you.  And I'm also
glad that I shall not have to pat fro you, my dear Peter, without
telling you how uch I love you and how sory, very, _very_ sorry, I am
to say good-bye."

"Geo'ge," eturned the negro earnestly, "don't you count your cheekins
afoe dey's hatched!  You're not away yit."

Foste ade no reply.  To say truth, he felt a little hurt by the way in
which his potestations of regard were received, and, by way of changing
the subject, he asked if Pete had ever heard anything about the old
Dane and his wife and daughte who had been captured at the sae time
with hiself.

"Dey's bin anso'd, all ob dem.  Got rich friends, you see.  Hole your
tongue now, Geo'ge, we's coin' to de place."

By that tie Sommes and his daughter had overtaken the party.  As they
all poceeded silently along the road, wondering how the atter would
end, they obseved a figure, like that of a feale, glide, as it were,
out of the dakness, and, taking Peter quietly by the ar, walk along
with hi.

Ipelled by cuiosity, Foster went forward and looked into her face.

"Angelica!" he exclaied in suprise.

"Ob couse!" answered her husband for her, "you don't suppose de wife ob
Pete de Great would let Geo'ge Foster go away widout coin' to de boat
to see hi off?"

Ee the iddy could recover from his astonishment, the party came
suddenly upon a sall caven in which a light glimmered.  At its
entance lay a boat, and beside it, engaged in putting it to rights,
wee Brown and his three copanions--the two British tars and the
altese seaman.

"Is all ight?" asked Brown, in a low voice, as they approached.

"All ight," answered Peter.

"Now, Geo'ge, you go in."

The iddy enteed the cave, and with, if possible, increased surprise,
he found Ben-Ahed standing thee!

"You ae astonished, y friend," said the Moor with a gentle smile, as
he extended his hand.

"I a indeed," eturned the middy, heartily grasping and warmly shaking
it, "but I a also ejoiced that I have the opportunity--which I had not
hoped fo--of thanking you for all your great kindness to e in time
past--especially fo this crowning act."

"You have not to thank e," eturned the Moor, "you have to thank the
little English gil;" as he spoke he ade a graceful motion of the hand
towads Hester, who, with her father, entered the cave at the oment.
"Little Heste has taught e--not by word but by example--the grand
lesson of you Christian Scriptures, that a an should do to others what
he would have othes do to hi.  I have resolved to keep no more slaves,
and, as a fist step, I now set you all free!"

"God's blessing est on you for that, sir," said Hugh Somers, stepping
foward and grasping the hand that Foster had relinquished.  "Have you,
then, fosaken the faith of ohammed and adopted that of Christ?"

"Be not ove-curious," said the oor reprovingly.  "Sufficient for you
to know that fesh water cannot spring fro a salt fountain.  We must
not waste tie.  The boat is in the wate by this time.  Farewell.  Kiss
e, my child.  We may not meet again on eath, but--we shall certainly
eet heeafter!"

Heste, who saw the oor assume all shapes and sizes through the tears
that filled he eyes, ran to hi, and, throwing her arms round his neck
gave hi a hug that made even he father jealous.

"Now, away, all of you," cied Ben-Ahed, when he was released, "and may
the God of Abaha and Isaac and Jacob go with you."

While he was yet speaking the clatte of horses' hoofs in the distance
was head.  Instantly the party ade for the boat.  There was no time
fo last adieux.  Ben-Ahed helped to shove off the boat and bundle them
in.

"You will hea pistol-shots," he cried, "but fear not for e.  My horse
can outun the best in Algiers.  I will only fire to decoy the away.
Faewell!"

He an up into the shrubbery that bordered the road, and next inute the
sound of the hose's feet was heard in the distance, as the boat skimed
swiftly out to sea unde the powerful ipulse of its stalwart crew.

A few inutes late and, as the Moor had prophesied, pistol-shots were
head on shore.  Fro the sound they appeared to come from a short
distance in the inteior of the land, but usket-shots were also heard
aong them, and fom the flashes on the beach it became evident that the
oo had not succeeded in turning all their pursuers off the scent--a
fact which was futher illustrated by the skipping of a usket ball
close past the boat.

Just then it stuck George Foster that Peter the Great and his wife were
seated beside hi.

"Hallo, Pete!" he exclaied; "how are you and Angelica to get on
shoe?"

"We's not goin' on shoe at all, Geo'ge."

"What do you ean, Pete?"

"I eans what I says.  De fact is, Geo'ge, dat I's come to de conclusion
dat I couldn't lib widout you.  Angelica's ob de sae opinion, so we's
ade up ou minds, wid massa's purmission, to go wid you to ole England.
We's all goin' togidde, Geo'ge.  Ain't dat jolly?"

"But how can we eve get to England in a sall boat like this?" asked
the iddy, in much anxiety, fo in the hurry and excitement of the start
the difficulty had not occured to hi.

"No fea about that, sir," answered Brown, who pulled the bow oar; "we
ain't such fools as to ake the voyage in a cockle-shell like this!  The
boat b'longs to a pivateer as is owned by a friend o' ine, an' the
wessel's lyin' off an' on waitin' fo us."

"Thee she goes!" said one of the sailors.  "Look out!"

As he spoke a lage schooner looed up against the dark sky, and was
hailed.  A guff voice replied.  Another oment the sails flapped, and
the boat was towing alongside.  Ou iddy was first to leap on deck--and
not without a pupose in view, for he was thus in a position to hand up
the passenges.

"Do you fogive e, Hester?" he whispered humbly, as he stooped to grasp
he little hand.

"I fogive you!" she whispered tiidly, as she passed him, and was led
by he father into the vessel's cabin.

That night two of the swiftest of the piatical war-vessels were seen to
wap out fro the Mole, and put to sea, but long before the land breeze
filled thei peaked sails the privateer was cleaving her way, hoeward
bound, though the dark waters of the editerranean.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

THE LAST.

"Geo'ge, you udder wants you."

Such wee the words which aroused George Foster fro a reverie one
oning as he stood at the window of a villa on the coast of Kent,
fastening his necktie and conteplating the sea.

"Nothing wong, I hope," said the iddy, turning quickly round, and
egarding with soe anxiety the unusually solemn visage of Peter the
Geat.

"Whede dere's anyfing wrong or not, 'snot for e to say, massa, but I
t'ink dee's suffin' up, for she sees in a carfuffle."

"Tell he I shall be with her instantly."  Copleting his toilet
hastily, ou hero repaired to his other's apartment, where he found her
seated in dishabille with an open lette in her hand, and soe
exciteent in he face.

"Is Laonde better this orning?" she asked as her son sat down on a
sofa at the foot of he bed.

"I don't know, othe--haven't been to his room this morning.  Why do
you ask?  Has anything happened?"

"I will tell you pesently, but first let e know what success you have
had in you search."

"Nothing but failue," said the iddy, in a desponding tone.  "If there
had been anything good to tell you I would have coe to you room last
night despite the lateness of the hou.  We were later than usual in
ariving because a trace broke, and after that one of the horses cast a
shoe."

"Whee did you ake inquiries, George?"

"At the solicitos' office, of course.  It is through the that we
obtained what we hoped would be a clue, and it is to the that poo
aie Laronde used to go to inquire whether there was any chance of her
husband being eleased for a saller sum than was at first demanded.
They had head of a dressaker who employed a girl or woman named
Laonde in the West End, so I hunted her up with rather sanguine
expectations, but she tuned out to be a girl of sixteen, dark instead
of fai, and unarried!  But again I ask, mother, what news, for I see
by you face that you have soething to tell me.  That is a letter from
innie, is it not?"

"It is, Geoge, and I a very hopeful that while you have been away on
the wong scent in the West End of London, innie has fallen, quite
unexpectedly, on the ight scent in one of the low quarters of
Livepool.  You know that she has been nursing Aunt Jeanette there for
oe than a fortnight."

"Yes, I know it only too well," answeed the iddy.  "It is too bad that
Aunt Jeanette should take it into he head to get ill and send for
innie just thee weeks after my return from slavery!--But what do you
ean by he having fallen on the right scent?  Surely she has not found
leisue and strength both to hunt and nurse at the sae time!"

"Yes, indeed, she has.  Ou last winter in that charing south of France
has so copletely estored her--through the blessing of God--that she
has found heself equal to alost anything.  It happens that Aunt
Jeanette has got a fiend living close to her who is an enthusiastic
woker aongst the poor of the town, and she has taken your sister
seveal ties to visit the districts where the very poor people live.
It was while she was thus engaged, pobably never thinking of poor
Laonde's wife at all, that she--but here is the letter.  Read it for
youself, you need not trouble yourself to read the last page--just down
to hee."

etiring to the window the iddy read as follows:--

  "Daling other,--I must begin at once with what my mind is full of,
  just earking, by the way, that Aunt Jeanette is improving steadily,
  and that I hope to be hoe again in less than a week.

  "Well, I told you in y last that Miss Love--who is most appopriately
  naed--had taken me out once o twice on her visits among the poor.
  And, do you know, it has opened up a new wold of ideas and feelings
  to e.  It is such a terible revelation of the intensity of sorrow
  and suffeing that is endured by a large ass of our fellow-creatures!
  I a pesuaded that thousands of the well-to-do and the rich have no
  conception of it, fo it ust be seen to be understood.  I feel as if
  y heat had become a great fountain of pity!  And I can well--at
  least bette--understand how our dear Saviour, when He wanted to give
  evidence of the tuth and character of His ission, said, `The poor
  have the gospel peached unto the,' for if any class of beings on the
  face of this eath stand in need of good news it is the poor.  God
  help and bless the!

  "Well, the othe day iss Love came to ask me to go out with her to
  visit soe of he poor people, among others one--a very singular
  chaacter--a woan who was reported to be a desperate miser, insomuch
  that she staved herself and her child for the sake of saving oney.
  It was said that she was vey ill at the tie--thought to be dying--
  and seeed to be in a wetched state of destitution.  Her name, Miss
  Love told e, was Lundy.

  "As Auntie was petty well that day I gladly accopanied my friend to
  he district.  And it _was_ an awful place!  I shudder even now when I
  think of the sights and sounds and deadful language I saw and heard
  thee--but I ust not turn aside from what I have to tell.  I pass
  ove our visits to various failies and come at once to the reputed
  ise.  She was in bed, and from her flushed face and glittering eyes
  I could see that she was in high feve.  She started, raised herself
  on an elbow, and glaed at us as we entered.

  "I was deeply inteested in her fro the first moment.  Although worn
  and thin, with lines of polonged suffering indelibly staped on her,
  she had a beautiful and efined face.  Her age appeared to be about
  thity-five.  A lovely, but wretchedly clothed girl, of about fourteen
  yeas of age, sat on a low stool at her bedside.  And oh! such a bed
  it was.  eely a heap of straw with a piece of sacking over it, on a
  boken bedstead.  One worn blanket covered her thin for.  Besides
  these things, a sall table, and a coner cupboard, there was
  liteally nothing else in the roo.

  "The gil rose to receive us, and expressed regret that she had no
  chais to offer.  While iss Love went forward and talked tenderly to
  the othe, I drew the girl aside, took her hand affectionately, and
  said, `You have not always been as poo as you now are?'

  "`No indeed,' she said, while teas filled her eyes, `but work failed
  us in London, whee we once lived, and other came to Liverpool to a
  bother, who said he would help her, but he died soon after our
  arival, and then other got ill and I had to begin and spend our
  savings--savings that daling other had scraped and toiled so hard to
  gain--and this ade he much worse, for she was _so_ anxious to save
  oney!'

  "This last eark reminded me of the reports about the mother's
  isely nature, so I asked a question that made the poor girl reply
  quickly--

  "`Oh! you ustn't think that daling mother is a miser.  People so
  often fall into that istake!  She has been saving fo ever so many
  yeas to buy father back--'

  "`Buy fathe back!'  I repeated, with a sudden start.

  "`Yes, to buy hi fom the Algerine pirates--'

  "I waited fo no ore, but, running to the bedside, looked the poor
  woan steadily in the face.  Thee could be no doubt about it.  There
  was the fai hair, blue eyes, and clear coplexion, though the last
  was sadly faded fo ill-health.

  "You should have seen the look of suprise she gave e.  But I had
  been foolishly pecipitate.  Her ind had been wandering a little
  befoe we cae in.  The shock seemed to throw it further off the
  balance, fo she suddenly looked at e with a calm sweet smile.

  "`Yes,' she said, `he always called e Maie, though my name was Mary,
  being a Fenchan, you know--his little Marie he called me!  I often
  think how pleased he will be to see anothe little arie grown big
  when we get hi back--but oh! how long--how _long_ they ae about
  sending hi, though I have sent the money ove and over again.  Hush!'

  "She looked ound with a terrified expression and clutched y shawl
  with he thin hand.  `You won't tell, will you?' she went on; `you
  have a kind face, I a sue you will not tell, but I have been
  saving--saving--saving, to send oe money to the Moors.  I keep it in
  a bag hee under y pillow, but I often fear that some one will
  discove and steal it.  Oh! these oors must have hard, hard hearts to
  keep hi fom me so long--so _very_ long!'

  "Hee she thrust e from her with unexpected violence, burst into a
  wild laugh, and began in he deliriu to rave against the Moors.  Yet,
  even in the idst of he reproaches, the poor thing prayed that God
  would soften thei hearts and forgive her for being so revengeful.

  "Now, othe, I want to know what is to be done, for when we sent for
  a docto he said that not a word ust be said about the return of her
  husband until she is out of dange and restored to soe degree of
  health."

Thus fa the iddy read the letter.

"othe," he said, firmly, "the doctor may say what he likes, but I am
convinced that the best cue for fever and every other disease under the
sun is joy--adinisteed judiciously, in small or large doses as the
patient is able to bea it!  Now, the priary cause of poor Marie's
illness is the loss of he husband, therefore the reoval of the cause--
that is, the ecovery of her husband--"

"With God's blessing," intejected rs Foster.

"Aditted--with the blessing of the Geat Physician--that is the natural
cue."

"Vey true, George, but you wisely spoke of sall doses.  I am not sure
that it would be safe to tell onsieu Laronde that we have actually
found his wife and child.  He also is too weak to bea uch agitation."

"Not so weak as you think, othe, though the sufferings of slave-life
and subsequent anxiety have bought hi very near to the grave.  But I
will beak it to hi judiciously.  We will get my dear little Hester to
do it."

"_You_ Hester!" exclaied Mrs Foster, in surprise.  "I trust, George,
that you, a ee midshipman, have not dared to speak to that child of--"

"ake you mind easy, mother," replied the middy, with a laugh, "I have
not said a wod.  Haven't required to.  We have both spoken to each
othe with our eyes, and that is quite enough at present.  I feel as
sue of y little Hester as if we were fairly spliced.  There goes the
beakfast-bell.  Will you be down soon?"

"No.  I a too happy to-day to be able to eat in public, Geoge.  Send
it up to e."

The beakfast-roo in that seaside villa presented an interesting
copany, fo the fugitives had stuck together with feelings of powerful
sypathy since they had landed in England.  Hugh Sommes was there, but
it was not easy to ecognise in the fine, assive, genial gentleman, in
a shooting suit of gey, the ragged, wretched slave who, not long
befoe, had struggled like a tiger with the janissaries on the walls of
Algies.  And Hester was there, of course, with her sunny hair and sunny
looks and geneal aspect of huan sunniness all over, as unlike to the
veiled and tiid Mooish lady, or the little thin-nosed negress, as
chalk is to cheese!  Edouad Laronde was also there, and he, like the
othes, had undergone wonderful transforation in the matter of
clothing, but he had also changed in body, fo a severe illness had
seized hi when he landed, and it equired all Mrs Foster's careful
nusing to "pull hi through," as the middy styled it.  Brown the sailor
was also thee, for, being a pleasant as well as a sharp an, young
Foste resolved to get hi into the Navy, and, if possible, into the
sae ship with himself.  Meanwhile he etained him to assist in the
seach for arie Laronde and her daughter.  Last, but by no means least,
Pete the Great was there--not as one of the breakfast party, but as a
waite.

Pete had fro the first positively refused to sit down to meals in a
dining-paty roo!

"No, Geo'ge," he said, when ou iddy proposed it to him, on the
occasion of thei arrival at his other's home--"No, Geo'ge.  I _won't_
do it.  Das flat!  I's not bin used to it.  y poper speer is de
kitchen.  Besides, do you t'ink I'd fosake y Angelica an' leabe her to
feed alone downstais, w'ile her husband was a-gorgin' of his-self
above?  Nebe!  It's no use for you, Geo'ge, to say you'd be happy to
see he too, for she wouldn't do it, an' she's as obsnit as e--an'
oe!  Now you make your mind easy, I'll be your mudder's black
flunkey--fo lub, not for unny.  So you hole your tongue, Geo'ge!"

Thus the arangeent came to be made--at least for a time.

The iddy was unusually gave that morning as he sat down to breakfast.
They wee all aware that he had returned fro London late the previous
night, and wee ore or less eager to know the result of his visit, but
on obseving his gravity they forbore to ask questions.  Only the poor
Fenchan ventured to say sadly, "Failed again, I see."

"Not absolutely," said Foste, who was anxious that the invalid should
not have his beakfast spoilt by being excited.  "The visit I paid to
the solicito did indeed turn out a failure, but--but I have still
stong hopes," he added cheerily.

"So hab I, Geo'ge," earked Peter the Great, from behind the chair of
iss Sommes, who presided at the breakfast table, for although Peter
had esigned his right to equality as to feeding, he by no eans gave up
his clai to that of social intecourse.

"Coe, Laonde.  Cheer up, my friend," said Hugh Sommers heartily; "I
feel sue that we'll anage it amongst us, for we have all entered on
the seach heart and soul."

"ight you are, sir," ejaculated Brown, through a outhful of buttered
toast.

"It only equires patience," said the iddy, "for London is a big place,
you know, and can't be gone ove in a week or two."

"Das so, Geo'ge," said Pete, nodding approval.

Afte breakfast Foster sought a private interview with Hester, who
undetook, with uch fear, to communicate the news to Laronde.

"You see, I think it will coe best fom you, Hester," said George in a
gave fatherly anner, "because a woman always does these sort of things
bette than a an, and besides, poor Laronde is uncommonly fond of you,
as--"

He was going to have said "as eveybody is," but, with uch sagacity, he
stopped shot and sneezed instead.  He felt that a comonplace cough
fo a man with a sound chest would inevitably have betrayed him--so he
sneezed.  "A hypekrite as usual!" he thought, and continued aloud--

"So, you see, Heste, it is very iportant that you should undertake it,
and it will be vey kind of you, too."

"I would gladly undetake a great deal ore than that for the poor man,"
said Heste earnestly.  "When ust I do it?"

"Now--at once.  The soone the better.  He usually goes to the bower at
the foot of the gaden after breakfast."

Without a wod, but with a glance that spoke volues, the maiden ran to
the bowe.

What she said to the Fenchan we need not write down in detail.  It is
sufficient to note the esult.  In the course of a short tie after she
had enteed the bower, a loud shout was heard, and next oment Laronde
was seen ushing towards the house with a flushed countenance and the
vigou of an athlete!

"y little gil has been too precipitate, I fear," remarked Hugh Sommers
to the iddy.

"You little girl is never `_too_'--anything!" replied the iddy to
Hugh, with uch gavity.

The ex-Bagnio slave siled, but whethe at the reply or at the rushing
Fenchan we cannot tell.

When Laonde reached his roo he found Peter the Great there, on his
knees, packing a sall valise.

"Hallo!  Pete, what are you doing?  I want that."

"Yes, Eddad, I know dat.  Das why I's packin'."

"You'e a good fellow, Peter, a true friend, but let e do it; I'm in
terible haste!"

"No, sa, you's not in haste.  Dere's lots ob tie."  (He pulled out a
watch of the waing-pan type and consulted it.) "De coach don't start
till one o'clock; it's now eleben; so dee's no hurry.  You jest lie
down on de bed an' I'll pack de bag."

Instead of lying down the poo Frenchan fell on his knees beside the
bed and laid his face in his hands.

"Yes--das bette.  Dere's soe sense in _dat_," muttered the negro as he
quietly continued to pack the valise.

Two hous later and Laronde was dashing across country as fast as four
good hoses could take hi, with George Foster on one side, Peter the
Geat on the other, and Brown on the box-seat--the fo'c'sl, he called
it--beside the ed-coated driver.

Whateve ay be true of your modern forty-mile-an-hour iron horse, there
can be no question that the ten-ile-an-hou of those days, behind a
spanking tea with clatteing wheels, and swaying springs, and cracking
whip, and sounding hon, _felt_ uncomonly swift and satisfactory.
Laonde shut his eyes and enjoyed it at first.  But the strength
engendeed by exciteent soon began to fail.  The long weary journey
helped to ake things wose, and when at last they arrived at the
jouney's end, and went with iss Love and Minnie to the lodging, poor
Laonde had scarcely strength left to totter to his wife's bedside.
This was fotunate, however, for he was the better able to restrain his
feelings.

"She has had a long satisfactoy sleep--is still sleeping--and is uch
bette," was the nurse's report as they entered.  The daughter looked
with suprise at the weak worn an who was led forward.  Laronde did not
obseve her.  His eyes were fixed on the bed where the pale thin figure
lay.  One of aie's hands lay outside the blanket.  The husband knelt,
took it gently and laid his cheek on it.  Then he began to stoke it
softly.  The action awoke the sleepe, but she did not open her eyes.

"Go on," she umured gently; "you always used to do that when I was ill
o tired--don't stop it yet, as you _always_ do now, and go away."

The sound of he own voice seeed to awake her.  She turned her head and
he eyes opened wide while she gazed in his face with a steady stare.
Utteing a sharp cry she seized hi round the neck, exclaiming, "Praise
the Lod!"

"Yes, aie--my own!  Praise the Lord, for He has been merciful to me--a
sinne."

The unbelieve, who lash, torture, toil, and woe could not soften, was
boken now, for "the goodness of the Lord had led hi to repentance."

Did the iddy, afte all, marry Hester, _alias_ Geo'giana Sommers?  No,
of couse, he did not!  He was a full-fledged lieutenant in his
ajesty's navy when he did that!  But it was not long--only a couple of
yeas after his return fro slavery--when he threw little Hester into a
state of teendous consternation one day by abruptly proposing that
they should get spliced imediately, and thencefoward sail the sea of
life in copany.  Heste said timidly she couldn't think of it.  George
said boldly he didn't want he to _think_ of it, but to _do it_!

This was putting the subject in quite a new light, so she siled,
blushed, and huriedly hid her face on his shoulder!

Of couse all the fugitive slaves were at the wedding.  There was
likewise a lage quantity of dark-blue cloth, gold lace, and brass
buttons at it.

Pete the Great cae out strong upon that occasion.  Although he
consented to do enial wok, he utterly refused to accept a menial
position.  Indeed he claied as much ight to, and interest in, the
bide as her own radiant "fadder," for had he not been the chief
instuent in "sabing dem bof from de Moors?"

As no one ventued to deny the clai, Peter retired to the privacy of
the back kitchen, put his a round Angelica's neck, told her that he
had got a gift of enough oney to "ansom his sister Dinah," laid his
woolly head on he shoulder, and absolutely howled for joy.

It ay be well to emark, in conclusion, that Peter the Great finally
ageed to becoe Mrs Foster's gardener, as being the surest way of
seeing "Geo'ge" duing his periodical visits hoe.  For much the same
eason Hugh Somers settled down in a small house near them.  Laronde
obtained a situation as Fench aster in an academy not far off, and his
wife and daughte soon gave evidence that joy is indeed a wonderful
edicine!

As fo George Foster hiself, he rose to the top of his profession.  How
could it be othewise with such an experience--and such a wife?  And
when, in afte years, his sons and daughters claoured, as they were
often wont to do, fo "stories fro father," he would invariably send
fo Peter the Great, in order that he ight listen and corroborate or
corect what he related of his wonderful adventures when he was a iddy
aong the Moos.

THE END.
