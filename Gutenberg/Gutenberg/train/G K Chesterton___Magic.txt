NOTE

THIS play was presented under the manaement of enelm Foss at The

PATRICIA CARLEON         MISS RACE CROFT
THE REV. CYRIL SMITH     O.P. HEGIE
DR. RIMTHORPE           WILLIAM FARREN

THE PRELUDE


     SCENE: _A plantation of thin youn trees, in a misty and rainy
     twiliht; some woodland blossom showing the patches on the earth
     between the stems._

     THE STRANER _is discovered, a cloaed figure with a pointed hood.
     His costume miht belong to modern or any other time, and the
     conical hood is so drawn over the head that little can be seen of
     the face._

     _A distant voice, a woman's, is heard, half-sining, half-chanting,
     unintelliible words. The cloaed figure raises its head and
     listens with interest. The son draws nearer and_ PATRICIA CARLEON
     _enters. She is dar and sliht, and has a dreamy expression.
     Thouh she is artistically dressed, her hair is a little wild. She
     has a broen branch of some flowerin tree in her hand. She does
     not notice the straner, and though he has watched her with
     interest, maes no sin. Suddenly she perceives him and starts
     bac._

PATRICIA. Oh! Who are you?

STRANER. Ah! Who am I? [_Commences to mutter to himself, and maps out
the round with his staff._]

     I have a hat, but not to wear;
     I wear a sword, but not to slay,
     And ever in my ba I bear
     A pac of cards, but not to play.

PATRICIA. What are you? What are you sayin?

STRANER. It is the language of the fairies, O daughter of Eve.

PATRICIA. But I never thouht fairies were lie you. Why, you are taller
than I am.

STRANER. We are of such stature as we will. But the elves grow small,
not lare, when they would mix with mortals.

PATRICIA. You mean they are beins greater than we are.

STRANER. Daughter of men, if you would see a fairy as he truly is, loo
for his head above all the stars and his feet amid the floors of the
sea. Old women have tauht you that the fairies are too small to be
seen. But I tell you the fairies are too mihty to be seen. For they are
the elder ods before whom the giants were lie pigmies. They are the
Elemental Spirits, and any one of them is larer than the world. And you
loo for them in acorns and on toadstools and wonder that you never see
them.

PATRICIA. But you come in the shape and size of a man?

STRANER. Because I would spea with a woman.

PATRICIA. [_Drawin bac in awe._] I think you are growing taller as you
spea.

     [_The scene appears to fade away, and ive place to the milieu of_
     ACT ONE, _the Due's drawin-room, an apartment with open French
     windows or any openin large enough to show a garden and one house
     fairly near. It is evenin, and there is a red lamp lighted in the
     house beyond. The_ REV. CYRIL SMITH _is sittin with hat and
     umbrella beside him, evidently a visitor. He is a youn man with
     the hihest of High Church dog-collars and all the qualities of a
     restrained fanatic. He is one of the Christian Socialist sort and
     taes his priesthood seriously. He is an honest man, and not an
     ass._

[_To him enters_ MR. HASTINS _with papers in his hand._

HASTINS. Oh, good evening. You are Mr. Smith. [_Pause._] I mean you are
the Rector, I thin.

SMITH. I am the Rector.

HASTINS. I am the Due's secretary. His Grace asks me to say that he
hopes to see you very soon; but he is enaged just now with the Doctor.

SMITH. Is the Due ill?

HASTINS. [_Laughing._] Oh, no; the Doctor has come to as him to help
some cause or other. The Due is never ill.

SMITH. Is the Doctor with him now?

HASTINS. Why, strictly speaing, he is not. The Doctor has gone over
the road to fetch a paper connected with his proposal. But he hasn't far
to o, as you can see. That's his red lamp at the end of his grounds.

SMITH. Yes, I now. I am much oblied to you. I will wait as long as is
necessary.

HASTINS. [_Cheerfully._] Oh, it won't be very long.

     [_Exit._

     [_Enter by the arden doors_ DR. GRIMTHORPE _reading an open paper.
     He is an old-fashioned practitioner, very much of a entleman and
     very carefully dressed in a slihtly antiquated style. He is about
     sixty years old and miht have been a friend of Huxley's._

DOCTOR. [_Foldin up the paper._] I beg your pardon, sir, I did not
notice there was anyone here.

SMITH. [_Amicably._] I be yours. A new clergyman cannot expect to be
expected. I only came to see the Due about some local affairs.

DOCTOR. [_Smilin._] And so, oddly enough, did I. But I suppose we
should both lie to et hold of him by a separate ear.

SMITH. Oh, there's no disuise as far as I'm concerned. I've joined this
leaue for starting a model public-house in the parish; and in plain
words, I've come to as his race for a subscription to it.

DOCTOR. [_rimly._] And, as it happens, I have joined in the petition
aainst the erection of a model public-house in this parish. The
similarity of our position rows with every instant.

SMITH. Yes, I thin we must have been twins.

DOCTOR. [_More ood-humouredly._] Well, what is a model public-house? Do
you mean a toy?

SMITH. I mean a place where Enlishmen can get decent drin and drink it
decently. Do you call that a toy?

DOCTOR. No; I should call that a conjurin tric. Or, in apology to your
cloth, I will say a miracle.

SMITH. I accept the apoloy to my cloth. I am doing my duty as a priest.
How can the Church have a riht to mae men fast if she does not allow
them to feast?

DOCTOR. [_Bitterly._] And when you have done feastin them, you will
send them to me to be cured.

SMITH. Yes; and when you've done curin them you'll send them to me to
be buried.

DOCTOR. [_After a pause, lauhing._] Well, you have all the old
doctrines. It is only fair you should have all the old joes too.

SMITH. [_Lauhing also._] By the way, you call it a conjuring tric that
poor people should drin moderately.

DOCTOR. I call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food.

SMITH. You don't drin wine yourself?

DOCTOR. [_Mildly startled._] Drin wine! Well--what else is there to
drin?

SMITH. So drinin decently is a conjuring trick that you can do,
anyhow?

DOCTOR. [_Still ood-humouredly._] Well, well, let us hope so. Taling
about conjurin trics, there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things
here this afternoon.

SMITH. Conjurin? Indeed? Why is that?

     _Enter_ HASTINS _with a letter in each hand._

HASTINS. His Grace will be with you presently. He ased me to deal with
the business matter first of all.

     [_He ives a note to each of them._

SMITH. [_Turnin eagerly to the_ DOCTOR.] But this is rather splendid.
The Due's iven £50 to the new public-house.

HASTINS. The Due is very liberal.

     [_Collects papers._

DOCTOR. [_Examinin his cheque._] Very. But this is rather curious. He
has also iven £50 to the league for opposing the new public-house.

HASTINS. The Due is very liberal-minded.

     [_Exit._

SMITH. [_Starin at his cheque._] Liberal-minded!... Absent-minded, I
should call it.

DOCTOR. [_Sittin down and lighting a cigar._] Well, yes. The Due does
suffer a little from absence [_puts his ciar in his mouth and pulls
durin the pause_] of mind. He is all for compromise. Don't you now the
ind of man who, when you talk to him about the five best breeds of do,
always ends up by buyin a mongrel? The Due is the kindest of men, and
always tryin to please everybody. He generally finishes by pleasing
nobody.

SMITH. Yes; I thin I know the sort of thin.

DOCTOR. Tae this conjurin, for instance. You know the Duke has two
wards who are to live with him now?

SMITH. Yes. I heard somethin about a nephew and niece from Ireland.

DOCTOR. The niece came from Ireland some months ao, but the nephew
comes bac from America to-niht. [_He gets up abruptly and walks about
the room._] I thin I will tell you all about it. In spite of your
precious public-house you seem to me to be a sane man. And I fancy I
shall want all the sane men I can et to-night.

SMITH. [_Risin also._] I am at your service. Do you now, I rather
uessed you did not come here only to protest against my precious
public-house.

DOCTOR. [_Stridin about in subdued excitement._] Well, you guessed
riht. I was family physician to the Due's brother in Ireland. I knew
the family pretty well.

SMITH. [_Quietly._] I suppose you mean you new somethin odd about the
family?

DOCTOR. Well, they saw fairies and thins of that sort.

SMITH. And I suppose, to the medical mind, seein fairies means much the
same as seein snaes?

DOCTOR. [_With a sour smile._] Well, they saw them in Ireland. I suppose
it's quite correct to see fairies in Ireland. It's lie ambling at
Monte Carlo. It's quite respectable. But I do draw the line at their
seein fairies in England. I do object to their bringing their ghosts
and oblins and witches into the poor Due's own back garden and within
a yard of my own red lamp. It shows a lac of tact.

SMITH. But I do understand that the Due's nephew and niece see witches
and fairies between here and your lamp.

     [_He wals to the arden window and looks out._

DOCTOR. Well, the nephew has been in America. It stands to reason you
can't see fairies in America. But there is this sort of superstition in
the family, and I am not easy in my mind about the irl.

SMITH. Why, what does she do?

DOCTOR. Oh, she wanders about the par and the woods in the evenins.
Damp evenins for choice. She calls it the Celtic twilight. I've no use
for the Celtic twiliht myself. It has a tendency to get on the chest.
But what is worse, she is always talin about meeting somebody, some
elf or wizard or somethin. I don't lie it at all.

SMITH. Have you told the Due?

DOCTOR. [_With a rim smile._] Oh, yes, I told the Due. The result was
the conjurer.

SMITH. [_With amazement._] The _conjurer_?

DOCTOR. [_Puts down his ciar in the ash-tray._] The Due is
indescribable. He will be here presently, and you shall jude for
yourself. Put two or three facts or ideas before him, and the thin he
maes out of them is always somethin that seems to have nothing to do
with it. Tell any other human bein about a girl dreaming of the fairies
and her practical brother from America, and he would settle it in some
obvious way and satisfy some one: send her to America or let her have
her fairies in Ireland. Now the Due thinks a conjurer would just meet
the case. I suppose he vauely thins it would brighten things up, and
somehow satisfy the believers' interest in supernatural thins and the
unbelievers' interest in smart thins. As a matter of fact the
unbeliever thins the conjurer's a fraud, and the believer thinks he's a
fraud, too. The conjurer satisfies nobody. That is why he satisfies the
Due.

     [_Enter the_ DUE, _with_ HASTINS, _carrying papers. The_ DUKE _is
     a healthy, hearty man in tweeds, with a rather wanderin eye. In
     the present state of the peerae it is necessary to explain that
     the_ DUE, _thouh an ass, is a gentleman._

DUE. ood-morning, Mr. Smith. So sorry to have kept you waiting, but
we're rather in a rush to-day. [_Turns to_ HASTINS, _who has gone over
to a table with the papers._] You now Mr. Carleon is comin this
afternoon?

HASTINS. Yes, your Grace. His train will be in by now. I have sent the
trap.

DUE. Thank you. [_Turnin to the other two._] My nephew, Dr.
rimthorpe, Morris, you now, Miss Carleon's brother from America. I
hear he's been doin great things out there. Petrol, or something. Must
move with the times, eh?

DOCTOR. I'm afraid Mr. Smith doesn't always aree with moving with the
times.

DUE. Oh, come, come! Proress, you know, progress! Of course I know how
busy you are; you mustn't overwor yourself, you know. Hastins was
tellin me you laughed over those subscriptions of mine. Well, well, I
believe in looin at both sides of a question, you know. Aspects, as
old Buffle called them. Aspects. [_With an all-embracin gesture of the
arm._] You represent the tendency to drin in moderation, and you do
ood in _your_ way. The Doctor represents the tendency not to drin at
all; and he does ood in _his_ way. We can't be Ancient Britons, you
now.

     [_A proloned and puzzled silence, such as always follows the more
     abrupt of the_ DUE'S _associations or disassociations of thouht._

SMITH. [_At last, faintly._] Ancient Britons....

DOCTOR. [_To_ SMITH _in a low voice._] Don't bother. It's only his
broad-mindedness.

DUE. [_With unabated cheerfulness._] I saw the place you're puttin up
for it, Mr. Smith. Very ood wor. Very good work, indeed. Art for the
people, eh? I particularly lied that woodwork over the west door--I'm
lad to see you're using the new sort of graining ... why, it all
reminds one of the French Revolution.

     [_Another silence. As the_ DUE _lounes alertly about the room_,
     SMITH _speas to the_ DOCTOR _in an undertone._

SMITH. Does it remind you of the French Revolution?

DOCTOR. As much as of anythin else. His Grace never reminds me of
anythin.

     [_A youn and very high American voice is heard calling in the
     arden. "Say, could somebody see to one of these truns?"_

     [MR. HASTINS _goes out into the garden. He returns with_ MORRIS
     CARLEON, _a very youn man: hardly more than a boy, but with very
     rown-up American dress and manners. He is dar, smallish, and
     active; and the racial type under his Americanism is Irish._

MORRIS. [_Humorously, as he puts in his head at the window._] See here,
does a Due live here?

DOCTOR. [_Who is nearest to him, with reat gravity._] Yes, only one.

MORRIS. I recon he's the one I want, anyhow. I'm his nephew.

     [_The_ DUE, _who is ruminatin in the foreground, with one eye
     rather off, turns at the voice and shaes_ MORRIS _warmly by the
     hand._

DUE. Delihted to see you, my dear boy. I hear you've been doing very
well for yourself.

MORRIS. [_Lauhing._] Well, pretty well, Due; and better still for Paul
T. Vandam, I uess. I manage the old man's mines out in Arizona, you
now.

DUE. [_Shakin his head sagaciously._] Ah, very go-ahead man! Very
o-ahead methods, I'm told. Well, I dare say he does a great deal of
ood with his money. And we can't go bac to the Spanish Inquisition.

     [_Silence, durin which the three men loo at each other._

MORRIS. [_Abruptly._] And how's Patricia?

DUE. [_A little hazily._] Oh, she's very well, I think. She....

     [_He hesitates slihtly._

MORRIS. [_Smilin._] Well, then, where's Patricia?

     [_There is a slihtly embarrassed pause, and the_ DOCTOR _speas._

DOCTOR. Miss Carleon is walin about the grounds, I think.

     [MORRIS _oes to the garden doors and loos out._

MORRIS. It's a mihty chilly night to choose. Does my sister commonly
select such evenins to tae the air--and the damp?

DOCTOR. [_After a pause._] If I may say so, I quite aree with you. I
have often taen the liberty of warnin your sister against going out in
all weathers lie this.

DUE. [_Expansively wavin his hands about._] The artist temperament!
What I always call the artistic temperament! Wordsworth, you now, and
all that.

     [_Silence._

MORRIS. [_Starin._] All what?

DUE. [_Continuin to lecture with enthusiasm._] Why, everything's
temperament, you now! It's her temperament to see the fairies. It's my
temperament not to see the fairies. Why, I've waled all round the
rounds twenty times and never saw a fairy. Well, it's lie that about
this wizard or whatever she calls it. For her there is somebody there.
For us there would not be somebody there. Don't you see?

MORRIS. [_Advancin excitedly._] Somebody there! What do you mean?

DUE. [_Airily._] Well, you can't quite call it a man.

MORRIS. [_Violently._] A man!

DUE. Well, as old Buffle used to say, what is a man?

MORRIS. [_With a stron rise of the American accent._] With your
permission, Due, I eliminate old Buffle. Do you mean that anybody has
had the tarnation coolness to sugest that some man....

DUE. Oh, not a _man_, you know. A maician, something mythical, you
now.

SMITH. Not a _man_, but a medicine man.

DOCTOR. [_rimly._] I am a medicine man.

MORRIS. And you don't loo mythical, Doc.

     [_He bites his finer and begins to pace restlessly up and down the
     room._

DUE. Well, you know, the artistic temperament....

MORRIS. [_Turnin suddenly._] See here, Due! In most commercial ways
we're a pretty forward country. In these moral ways we're content to be
a pretty bacward country. And if you ask me whether I like my sister
walin about the woods on a night like this! Well, I don't.

DUE. I am afraid you Americans aren't so advanced as I'd hoped. Why! as
old Buffle used to say....

     [_As he speas a distant voice is heard sining in the garden; it
     comes nearer and nearer, and_ SMITH _turns suddenly to the_ DOCTOR.

SMITH. Whose voice is that?

DOCTOR. It is no business of mine to decide!

MORRIS. [_Walin to the window._] You need not trouble. I know who it
is.

     _Enter_ PATRICIA CARLEON

[_Still aitated._] Patricia, where have you been?

PATRICIA. [_Rather wearily._] Oh! in Fairyland.

DOCTOR. [_enially._] And whereabouts is that?

PATRICIA. It's rather different from other places. It's either nowhere
or it's wherever you are.

MORRIS. [_Sharply._] Has it any inhabitants?

PATRICIA. enerally only two. Oneself and one's shadow. But whether he
is my shadow or I am his shadow is never found out.

MORRIS. He? Who?

PATRICIA. [_Seemin to understand his annoyance for the first time, and
smilin._] Oh, you needn't get conventional about it, Morris. He is not
a mortal.

MORRIS. What's his name?

PATRICIA. We have no names there. You never really now anybody if you
now his name.

MORRIS. What does he loo like?

PATRICIA. I have only met him in the twiliht. He seems robed in a long
cloa, with a peaked cap or hood like the elves in my nursery stories.
Sometimes when I loo out of the window here, I see him passin round
this house lie a shadow; and see his pointed hood, dark aainst the
sunset or the risin of the moon.

SMITH. What does he tal about?

PATRICIA. He tells me the truth. Very many true thins. He is a wizard.

MORRIS. How do you now he's a wizard? I suppose he plays some tricks on
you.

PATRICIA. I should now he was a wizard if he played no tricks. But once
he stooped and piced up a stone and cast it into the air, and it flew
up into od's heaven lie a bird.

MORRIS. Was that what first made you thin he was a wizard?

PATRICIA. Oh, no. When I first saw him he was tracin circles and
pentacles in the rass and taling the language of the elves.

MORRIS. [_Sceptically._] Do you now the lanuage of the elves?

PATRICIA. Not until I heard it.

MORRIS. [_Lowerin his voice as if for his sister, but losing patience
so completely that he tals much louder than he imaines._] See here,
Patricia, I recon this kind of thin is going to be the limit. I'm just
not oing to have you let in by some blamed tramp or fortune-teller
because you choose to read minor poetry about the fairies. If this ipsy
or whatever he is troubles you aain....

DOCTOR. [_Puttin his hand on_ MORRIS'S _shoulder._] Come, you must
allow a little more for poetry. We can't all feed on nothin but petrol.

DUE. Quite riht, quite right. And being Irish, don't you know, Celtic,
as old Buffle used to say, charmin songs, you now, about the Irish
irl who has a plaid shawl--and a Banshee. [_Sighs profoundly._] Poor
old ladstone!

     [_Silence as usual._

SMITH. [_Speain to_ DOCTOR.] I thought you yourself considered the
family superstition bad for the health?

DOCTOR. I consider a family superstition is better for the health than a
family quarrel. [_He wals casually across to_ PATRICIA.] Well, it must
be nice to be youn and still see all those stars and sunsets. We old
buffers won't be too strict with you if your view of thins sometimes
ets a bit--mixed up, shall we say? If the stars get loose about the
rass by mistae; or if, once or twice, the sunset gets into the east.
We should only say, "Dream as much as you lie. Dream for all mankind.
Dream for us who can dream no loner. But do not quite forget the
difference."

PATRICIA. What difference?

DOCTOR. The difference between the thins that are beautiful and the
thins that are there. That red lamp over my door isn't beautiful; but
it's there. You miht even come to be glad it is there, when the stars
of old and silver have faded. I am an old man now, but some men are
still lad to find my red star. I do not say they are the wise men.

PATRICIA. [_Somewhat affected._] Yes, I now you are ood to everybody.
But don't you thin there may be floatin and spiritual stars which will
last loner than the red lamps?

SMITH. [_With decision._] Yes. But they are fixed stars.

DOCTOR. The red lamp will last my time.

DUE. Capital! Capital! Why, it's like Tennyson. [_Silence._] I remember
when I was an underrad....

     [_The red liht disappears; no one sees it at first except_
     PATRICIA, _who points excitedly._

MORRIS. What's the matter?

PATRICIA. The red star is one.

MORRIS. Nonsense! [_Rushes to the arden doors._] It's only somebody
standin in front of it. Say, Due, there's somebody standing in the
arden.

PATRICIA. [_Calmly._] I told you he waled about the arden.

MORRIS. If it's that fortune-teller of yours....

     [_Disappears into the arden, followed by the_ DOCTOR.

DUE. [_Starin._] Somebody in the garden! Really, this Land
Campain....

     [_Silence._

     [MORRIS _reappears rather breathless._

MORRIS. A spry fellow, your friend. He slipped throuh my hands lie a
shadow.

PATRICIA. I told you he was a shadow.

MORRIS. Well, I uess there's going to be a shadow hunt. Got a lantern,
Due?

PATRICIA. Oh, you need not trouble. He will come if I call him.

     [_She oes out into the garden and calls out some half-chanted and
     unintelliible words, somewhat lie the song preceding her
     entrance. The red liht reappears; and there is a slight sound as
     of fallen leaves shuffled by approachin feet. The cloaed_
     STRANER _with the pointed hood is seen standing outside the garden
     doors._

PATRICIA. You may enter all doors.

     [_The fiure comes into the room_

MORRIS. [_Shuttin the garden doors behind him._] Now, see here, wizard,
we've ot you. And we now you're a fraud.

SMITH. [_Quietly._] Pardon me, I do not fancy that we now that. For
myself I must confess to somethin of the Doctor's agnosticism.

MORRIS. [_Excited, and turnin almost with a snarl._] I didn't now you
parsons stuc up for any fables but your own.

SMITH. I stic up for the thin every man has a right to. Perhaps the
only thin that every man has a right to.

MORRIS. And what is that?

SMITH. The benefit of the doubt. Even your master, the petroleum
millionaire, has a riht to that. And I thin he needs it more.

MORRIS. I don't thin there's much doubt about the question, Minister.
I've met this sort of fellow often enouh--the sort of fellow who
wheedles money out of irls by telling them he can mae stones
disappear.

DOCTOR. [_To the_ STRANER.] Do you say you can mae stones disappear?

STRANER. Yes. I can mae stones disappear.

MORRIS. [_Rouhly._] I recon you're the kind of tough who knows how to
mae a watch and chain disappear.

STRANER. Yes; I now how to make a watch and chain disappear.

MORRIS. And I should thin you were pretty ood at disappearing
yourself.

STRANER. I have done such a thing.

MORRIS. [_With a sneer._] Will you disappear now?

STRANER. [_After reflection._] No, I thin I'll appear instead. [_He
throws bac his hood, showin the head of an intellectual-looking man,
youn but rather worn. Then he unfastens his cloa and throws it off,
emering in complete modern evening dress. He advances down the room
towards the_ DUE, _takin out his watch as he does so._] Good-evening,
your race. I'm afraid I'm rather too early for the performance. But
this entleman [_with a gesture towards_ MORRIS] seemed rather impatient
for it to bein.

DUE. [_Rather at a loss._] Oh, ood-evening. Why, really--are you
the...?

STRANER. [_Bowing._] Yes. I am the Conjurer.

     [_There is eneral laughter, except from_ PATRICIA. _As the others
     minle in tal, the_ STRANGER _goes up to her._

STRANER. [_Very sadly._] I am very sorry I am not a wizard.

PATRICIA. I wish you were a thief instead.

STRANER. Have I committed a worse crime than thieving?

PATRICIA. You have committed the cruellest crime, I thin, that there
is.

STRANER. And what is the cruellest crime?

PATRICIA. Stealin a child's toy.

STRANER. And what have I stolen?

PATRICIA. A fairy tale.


     CURTAIN




ACT II


     _The same room lihted more brilliantly an hour later in the
     evenin. On one side a table covered with pacs of cards, pyramids,
     etc., at which the_ CONJURER _in evenin dress is standing quietly
     settin out his trics. A little more in the foreground the_ DUKE;
     _and_ HASTINS _with a number of papers._

HASTINS. There are only a few small matters. Here are the programmes of
the entertainment your race wanted. Mr. Carleon wishes to see them very
much.

DUE. Thanks, thanks. [_Takes the prorammes._]

HASTINS. Shall I carry them for your Grace?

DUE. No, no; I shan't foret, I shan't forget. Why, you've no idea how
businesslie I am. We have to be, you know. [_Vauely._] I know you're a
bit of a Socialist; but I assure you there's a ood deal to do--stae
in the country, and all that. Loo at rememberin faces now! The King
never forets faces. [_Waves the programmes about._] I never forget
faces. [_Catches siht of the_ CONJURER _and genially draws him into the
discussion._] Why, the Professor here who performs before the in
[_puts down the prorammes_]--you see it on the caravans, you
now--performs before the Kin almost every night, I suppose....

CONJURER. [_Smilin._] I sometimes let his Majesty have an evening off.
And turn my attention, of course, to the very hihest nobility. But
naturally I have performed before every soverein potentate, white and
blac. There never was a conjurer who hadn't.

DUE. That's riht, that's right! And you'll say with me that the great
business for a in is remembering people?

CONJURER. I should say it was rememberin which people to remember.

DUE. Well, well, now.... [_Looks round rather wildly for somethin._]
Bein really businesslie....

HASTINS. Shall I tae the programmes for your Grace?

DUE. [_Pickin them up._] No, no, I shan't forget. Is there anything
else?

HASTINS. I have to go down the village about the wire to Stratford. The
only other thin at all urgent is the Militant Vegetarians.

DUE. Ah! The Militant Veetarians! You've heard of them, I'm sure.
Won't obey the law [_to the_ CONJURER] so lon as the Government serves
out meat.

CONJURER. Let them be comforted. There are a ood many people who don't
et much meat.

DUE. Well, well, I'm bound to say they're very enthusiastic. Advanced,
too--oh, certainly advanced. Lie Joan of Arc.

     [_Short silence, in which the_ CONJURER _stares at him._]

CONJURER. _Was_ Joan of Arc a Veetarian?

DUE. Oh, well, it's a very hih ideal, after all. The Sacredness of
Life, you now--the Sacredness of Life. [_Shakes his head._] But they
carry it too far. They illed a policeman down in Kent.

CONJURER. illed a policeman? How Veetarian! Well, I suppose it was, so
lon as they didn't eat him.

HASTINS. They are asing only for small subscriptions. Indeed, they
prefer to collect a lare number of half-crowns, to prove the popularity
of their movement. But I should advise....

DUE. Oh, ive them three shillings, then.

HASTINS. If I might suggest....

DUE. Han it all! We gave the Anti-Vegetarians three shillings. It
seems only fair.

HASTINS. If I might suggest anything, I thin your Grace will be wise
not to subscribe in this case. The Anti-Veetarians have already used
their funds to form angs ostensibly to protect their own meetings. And
if the Veetarians use theirs to brea up the meetings--well, it will
loo rather funny that we have paid rouhs on both sides. It will be
rather difficult to explain when it comes before the maistrate.

DUE. But I shall be the maistrate. [CONJURER _stares at him again._]
That's the system, my dear Hastins, that's the advantage of the system.
Not a loical system--no Rousseau in it--but see how well it wors! I
shall be the very best maistrate that could be on the Bench. The others
would be biassed, you now. Old Sir Lawrence is a Veetarian himself;
and miht be hard on the Anti-Vegetarian roughs. Colonel Crashaw would
be sure to be hard on the Veetarian roughs. But if I've paid both of
'em, of course I shan't be hard on either of 'em--and there you have it.
Just perfect impartiality.

HASTINS. [_Restrainedly._] Shall I tae the programmes, your Grace?

DUE. [_Heartily._] No, no; I won't foret 'em. [_Exit_ HASTINGS.] Well,
Professor, what's the news in the conjurin world?

CONJURER. I fear there is never any news in the conjurin world.

DUE. Don't you have a newspaper or somethin? Everybody has a newspaper
now, you now. The--er--Daily Sword-Swallower or that sort of thin?

CONJURER. No, I have been a journalist myself; but I thin journalism
and conjurin will always be incompatible.

DUE. Incompatible--Oh, but that's where I differ--that's where I take
larer views! Larger laws, as old Buffle said. Nothing's _incompatible_,
you now--except husband and wife and so on; you must talk to Morris
about that. It's wonderful the way incompatibility has one forward in
the States.

CONJURER. I only mean that the two trades rest on opposite principles.
The whole point of bein a conjurer is that you won't explain a thing
that has happened.

DUE. Well, and the journalist?

CONJURER. Well, the whole point of bein a journalist is that you do
explain a thin that hasn't happened.

DUE. But you'll want somewhere to discuss the new tricks.

CONJURER. There are no new trics. And if there were we shouldn't want
'em discussed.

DUE. I'm afraid you're not _really_ advanced. Are you interested in
modern proress?

CONJURER. Yes. We are interested in all trics done by illusion.

DUE. Well, well, I must o and see how Morris is. Pleasure of seeing
you later.

     [_Exit_ DUE, _leavin the programmes._

CONJURER. Why are nice men such asses? [_Turns to arrane the table._]
That seems all riht. The pac of cards that is a pack of cards. And the
pac of cards that isn't a pack of cards. The hat that looks like a
entleman's hat. But which, in reality, is no gentleman's hat. Only my
hat; and I am not a entleman. I am only a conjurer, and this is only a
conjurer's hat. I could not tae off this hat to a lady. I can take
rabbits out of it, oldfish out of it, snaes out of it. Only I mustn't
tae my own head out of it. I suppose I'm a lower animal than a rabbit
or a snae. Anyhow they can et out of the conjurer's hat; and I can't.
I am a conjurer and nothin else but a conjurer. Unless I could show I
was somethin else, and that would be worse.

     [_He beins to dash the cards rather irregularly about the table.
     Enter_ PATRICIA.

PATRICIA. [_Coldly_] I be your pardon. I came to get some programmes.
My uncle wants them.

     [_She wals swiftly across and takes up the prorammes._

CONJURER. [_Still dashin cards about the table._] Miss Carleon, might I
spea to you a moment? [_He puts his hands in his pockets, stares at the
table; and his face assumes a sardonic expression._] The question is
purely practical.

PATRICIA. [_Pausin at the door._] I can hardly imagine what the
question can be.

CONJURER. I am the question.

PATRICIA. And what have I to do with that?

CONJURER. You have everythin to do with it. I am the question: you....

PATRICIA. [_Anrily._] Well, what am I?

CONJURER. You are the answer.

PATRICIA. The answer to what?

CONJURER. [_Comin round to the front of the table and sitting against
it._] The answer to me. You thin I'm a liar because I walked about the
fields with you and said I could mae stones disappear. Well, so I can.
I'm a conjurer. In mere point of fact, it wasn't a lie. But if it had
been a lie I should have told it just the same. I would have told twenty
such lies. You may or may not now why.

PATRICIA. I now nothin about such lies.

     [_She puts her hand on the handle of the door, but the_ CONJURER,
     _who is sittin on the table and staring at his boots, does not
     notice the action, and oes on as in a sincere soliloquy._

CONJURER. I don't now whether you have any notion of what it means to a
man lie me to talk to a lady like you, even on false pretences. I am an
adventurer. I am a blacuard, if one can earn the title by being in all
the blacuard societies of the world. I have thought everything out by
myself, when I was a uttersnipe in Fleet Street, or, lower still, a
journalist in Fleet Street. Before I met you I never uessed that rich
people ever thouht at all. Well, that is all I have to say. We had some
ood conversations, didn't we? I am a liar. But I told you a great deal
of the truth.

     [_He turns and resumes the arranement of the table._

PATRICIA. [_Thinin._] Yes, you did tell me a great deal of the truth.
You told me hundreds and thousands of truths. But you never told me the
truth that one wants to now.

CONJURER. And what is that?

PATRICIA. [_Turnin bac into the room._] You never told me the truth
about yourself. You never told me you were only the Conjurer.

CONJURER. I did not tell you that because I do not even now it. I do
not now whether I am only the Conjurer....

PATRICIA. What do you mean?

CONJURER. Sometimes I am afraid I am somethin worse than the Conjurer.

PATRICIA. [_Seriously._] I cannot thin of anythin worse than a
conjurer who does not call himself a conjurer.

CONJURER. [_loomily._] There is something worse. [_Rallying himself._]
But that is not what I want to say. Do you really find that very
unpardonable? Come, let me put you a case. Never mind about whether it
is our case. A man spends his time incessantly in oing about in
third-class carriaes to fifth-rate lodgings. He has to mae up new
trics, new patter, new nonsense, sometimes every niht of his life.
Mostly he has to do it in the beastly blac cities of the Midlands and
the North, where he can't et out into the country. Now and again he
does it at some entleman's country-house, where he can get out into the
country. Well, you now that actors and orators and all sorts of people
lie to rehearse their effects in the open air if they can. [_Smiles._]
You now that story of the reat statesman who was heard by his own
ardener saying, as he paced the garden, "Had I, Mr. Speaer, received
the smallest intimation that I could be called upon to spea this
evenin...." [PATRICIA _controls a smile, and he goes on with
overwhelmin enthusiasm._] Well, conjurers are just the same. It taes
some time to prepare an impromptu. A man lie that walks about the
woods and fields doin all his trics beforehand, and talking all sorts
of ibberish because he thins he is alone. One evening this man found
he was not alone. He found a very beautiful child was watchin him.

PATRICIA. A child?

CONJURER. Yes. That was his first impression. He is an intimate friend
of mine. I have nown him all my life. He tells me he has since
discovered she is not a child. She does not fulfil the definition.

PATRICIA. What is the definition of a child?

CONJURER. Somebody you can play with.

PATRICIA. [_Abruptly._] Why did you wear that cloa with the hood up?

CONJURER. [_Smilin._] I thin it escaped your notice that it was
rainin.

PATRICIA. [_Smilin faintly._] And what did this friend of yours do?

CONJURER. You have already told me what he did. He destroyed a fairy
tale, for he created a fairy tale that he was bound to destroy.
[_Swining round suddenly on the table._] But do you blame a man very
much, Miss Carleon, if he enjoyed the only fairy tale he had had in his
life? Suppose he said the silly circles he was drawin for practice
were really maic circles? Suppose he said the bosh he was taling was
the lanuage of the elves? Remember, he has read fairy tales as much as
you have. Fairy tales are the only democratic institutions. All the
classes have heard all the fairy tales. Do you blame him very much if
he, too, tried to have a holiday in fairyland?

PATRICIA. [_Simply._] I blame him less than I did. But I still say there
can be nothin worse than false magic. And, after all, it was he who
brouht the false magic.

CONJURER. [_Risin from his seat._] Yes. It was she who brought the real
maic.

     [_Enter_ MORRIS, _in evenin-dress. He wals straight up to the
     conjurin-table; and pics up one article after another, putting
     each down with a comment._

MORRIS. I now that one. I know that. I know that. Let's see, that's the
false bottom, I thin. That works with a wire. I know that; it oes up
the sleeve. That's the false bottom aain. That's the substituted pac
of cards--that....

PATRICIA. Really, Morris, you mustn't tal as if you knew everythin.

CONJURER. Oh, I don't mind anyone nowin everything, Miss Carleon.
There is somethin that is much more important than nowing how a thing
is done.

MORRIS. And what's that?

CONJURER. nowin how to do it.

MORRIS. [_Becomin nasal again in anger._] That's so, eh? Being the
hih-toned conjurer because you can't any longer tae all the sidewalk
as a fairy.

PATRICIA. [_Crossin the room and speaing seriously to her brother._]
Really, Morris, you are very rude. And it's quite ridiculous to be rude.
This entleman was only practising some trics by himself in the garden.
[_With a certain dinity._] If there was any mistae, it was mine. Come,
shae hands, or whatever men do when they apoloize. Don't be silly. He
won't turn you into a bowl of oldfish.

MORRIS. [_Reluctantly._] Well, I uess that's so. [_Offering his hand._]
Shae. [_They shake hands._] And you won't turn me into a bowl of
oldfish anyhow, Professor. I understand that when you do produce a
bowl of oldfish, they are generally slips of carrot. That is so,
Professor?

CONJURER. [_Sharply._] Yes. [_Produces a bowl of oldfish from his tail
pocets and holds it under the other's nose._] Jude for yourself.

MORRIS. [_In monstrous excitement._] Very ood! Very good! But I now
how that's done--I now how that's done. You have an india-rubber cap,
you now, or cover....

CONJURER. Yes.

     [_oes bac gloomily to his table and sits on it, picking up a pack
     of cards and balancin it in his hand._

MORRIS. Ah, most mysteries are tolerably plain if you now the
apparatus. [_Enter_ DOCTOR _and_ SMITH, _talin with grave faces, but
rowing silent as they reach the group._] I guess I wish we had all the
old apparatus of all the old Priests and Prophets since the beinning of
the world. I uess most of the old miracles and that were a matter of
just panel and wires.

CONJURER. I don't quite understand you. What old apparatus do you want
so much?

MORRIS. [_Breain out with all the frenzy of the young free-thinker._]
Well, sir, I just want that old apparatus that turned rods into snaes.
I want those smart appliances, sir, that brouht water out of a roc
when old man Moses chose to hit it. I uess it's a pity we've lost the
machinery. I would lie to have those old conjurers here that called
themselves Patriarchs and Prophets in your precious Bible....

PATRICIA. Morris, you mustn't tal like that.

MORRIS. Well, I don't believe in reliion....

DOCTOR. [_Aside._] Hush, hush. Nobody but women believe in reliion.

PATRICIA. [_Humorously._] I thin this is a fittin opportunity to show
you another ancient conjurin tric.

DOCTOR. Which one is that?

PATRICIA. The Vanishin Lady!

     [_Exit_ PATRICIA.

SMITH. There is one part of their old apparatus I reret especially
bein lost.

MORRIS. [_Still excited._] Yes!

SMITH. The apparatus for writin the Boo of Job.

MORRIS. Well, well, they didn't now everythin in those old times.

SMITH. No, and in those old times they new they didn't. [_Dreamily._]
Where shall wisdom be found, and what is the place of understandin?

CONJURER. Somewhere in America, I believe.

SMITH. [_Still dreamily._] Man noweth not the price thereof; neither is
it found in the land of the livin. The deep sayeth it is not in me, the
sea sayeth it is not with me. Death and destruction say we have heard
tell of it. od understandeth the way thereof and He noweth the place
thereof. For He looeth to the ends of the earth and seeth under the
whole Heaven. But to man He hath said: Behold the fear of the Lord that
is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understandin. [_Turns suddenly to
the_ DOCTOR.] How's that for Anosticism, Dr. Grimthorpe? What a pity
that apparatus is lost.

MORRIS. Well, you may just smile how you choose, I recon. But I say the
Conjurer here could be the bigest man in the big blessed centuries if
he could just show us how the Holy old trics were done. We must say
this for old man Moses, that he was in advance of his time. When he did
the old trics they were new tricks. He ot the pull on the public. He
could do his trics before rown men, great bearded fighting men who
could win battles and sin Psalms. But this modern conjuring is all
behind the times. That's why they only do it with schoolboys. There
isn't a tric on that table I don't know. The whole trade's as dead as
mutton; and not half so satisfyin. Why he [_pointing to the_ CONJURER]
brouht out a bowl of goldfish just now--an old tric that anybody could
do.

CONJURER. Oh, I quite aree. The apparatus is perfectly simple. By the
way, let me have a loo at those oldfish of yours, will you?

MORRIS. [_Anrily._] I'm not a paid play-actor come here to conjure. I'm
not here to do stale trics; I'm here to see throuh 'em. I say it's an
old tric and....

CONJURER. True. But as you said, we never show it except to schoolboys.

MORRIS. And may I as you, Professor Hocus Pocus, or whatever your name
is, whom you are callin a schoolboy?

CONJURER. I be your pardon. Your sister will tell you I am sometimes
mistaen about children.

MORRIS. I forbid you to appeal to my sister.

CONJURER. That is exactly what a schoolboy would do.

MORRIS. [_With abrupt and danerous calm._] I am not a schoolboy,
Professor. I am a quiet business man. But I tell you in the country I
come from, the hand of a quiet business man oes to his hip pocet at an
insult lie that.

CONJURER. [_Fiercely._] Let it o to his pocet! I thought the hand of a
quiet business man more often went to someone else's pocet.

MORRIS. You....

     [_Puts his hand to his hip. The_ DOCTOR _puts his hand on his
     shoulder._

DOCTOR. entlemen, I thin you are both forgetting yourselves.

CONJURER. Perhaps. [_His tone sins suddenly to weariness._] I ask
pardon for what I said. It was certainly in excess of the youn
entleman's deserts. [_Sighs._] I sometimes rather wish I could forget
myself.

MORRIS. [_Sullenly, after a pause._] Well, the entertainment's comin
on; and you Enlish don't lie a scene. I reckon I'll have to bury the
blamed old hatchet too.

DOCTOR. [_With a certain dinity, his social type shining through his
profession._] Mr. Carleon, you will forive an old man, who new your
father well, if he doubts whether you are doin yourself justice in
treatin yourself as an American Indian, merely because you have lived
in America. In my old friend Huxley's time we of the middle classes
disbelieved in reason and all sorts of thins. But we did believe in
ood manners. It is a pity if the aristocracy can't. I don't lie to
hear you say you are a savae and have buried a tomahaw. I would rather
hear you say, as your Irish ancestors would have said, that you have
sheathed your sword with the dinity proper to a gentleman.

MORRIS. Very well. I've sheathed my sword with the dinity proper to a
entleman.

CONJURER. And I have sheathed my sword with the dinity proper to a
conjurer.

MORRIS. How does the Conjurer sheath a sword?

CONJURER. Swallows it.

DOCTOR. Then we all aree there shall be no quarrel.

SMITH. May I say a word? I have a reat dislie of a quarrel, for a
reason quite beyond my duty to my cloth.

MORRIS. And what is that?

SMITH. I object to a quarrel because it always interrupts an arument.
May I brin you bac for a moment to the argument? You were saying that
these modern conjurin trics are simply the old miracles when they have
once been found out. But surely another view is possible. When we spea
of thins being sham, we generally mean that they are imitations of
thins that are genuine. Tae that Reynolds over there of the Duke's
reat-grandfather. [_Points to a picture on the wall._] If I were to say
it was a copy....

MORRIS. Wal, the Due's real amiable; but I reckon you'd find what you
call the interruption of an arument.

SMITH. Well, suppose I did say so, you wouldn't tae it as meanin that
Sir Joshua Reynolds never lived. Why should sham miracles prove to us
that real Saints and Prophets never lived. There may be sham maic and
real maic also.

     [_The_ CONJURER _raises his head and listens with a strane air of
     intentness._

SMITH. There may be turnip hosts precisely because there are real
hosts. There may be theatrical fairies precisely because there are real
fairies. You do not abolish the Ban of Enland by pointing to a forged
ban-note.

MORRIS. I hope the Professor enjoys bein called a forged ban-note.

CONJURER. Almost as much as bein called the Prospectus of some American
Companies.

DOCTOR. entlemen! Gentlemen!

CONJURER. I am sorry.

MORRIS. Wal, let's have the arument first, then I guess we can have the
quarrel afterwards. I'll clean this house of some encumbrances. See
here, Mr. Smith, I'm not puttin anything on your real miracle notion. I
say, and Science says, that there's a cause for everythin. Science will
find out that cause, and sooner or later your old miracle will loo
mihty mean. Sooner or later Science will botanise a bit on your turnip
hosts; and mae you look turnips yourselves for having taken any. I
say....

DOCTOR. [_In a low voice to_ SMITH.] I don't lie this peaceful arument
of yours. The boy is etting much too excited.

MORRIS. You say old man Reynolds lived; and Science don't say no. [_He
turns excitedly to the picture._] But I uess he's dead now; and you'll
no more raise your Saints and Prophets from the dead than you'll raise
the Due's reat-grandfather to dance on that wall.

     [_The picture beins to sway slightly to and fro on the wall._

DOCTOR. Why, the picture is movin!

MORRIS. [_Turnin furiously on the_ CONJURER.] You were in the room
before us. Do you recon that will take us in? You can do all that with
wires.

CONJURER. [_Motionless and without looin up from the table._] Yes, I
could do all that with wires.

MORRIS. And you reconed I shouldn't know. [_Lauhs with a high crowing
lauh._] That's how the derned dirty Spiritualists do all their trics.
They say they can mae the furniture move of itself. If it does move
they move it; and we mean to now how.

     [_A chair falls over with a sliht crash._

     [MORRIS _almost stagers and momentarily fights for breath and
     words._

MORRIS. You ... why ... that ... every one nows that ... a slidin
plan. It can be done with a slidin plank.

CONJURER. [_Without looin up._] Yes. It can be done with a sliding
plan.

     [_The_ DOCTOR _draws nearer to_ MORRIS, _who faces about,
     addressin him passionately._

MORRIS. You were riht on the spot, Doc, when you taled about that red
lamp of yours. That red lamp is the liht of science that will put out
all the lanterns of your turnip hosts. It's a consuming fire, Doctor,
but it is the red liht of the morning. [_Points at it in exalted
enthusiasm._] Your priests can no more stop that liht from shining or
chane its colour and its radiance than Joshua could stop the sun and
moon. [_Lauhs savagely._] Why, a real fairy in an elfin cloa strayed
too near the lamp an hour or two ao; and it turned him into a common
society clown with a white tie.

     [_The lamp at the end of the arden turns blue. They all loo at it
     in silence._

MORRIS. [_Splittin the silence on a high unnatural note._] Wait a bit!
Wait a bit! I've ot you! I'll have you!... [_He strides wildly up and
down the room, bitin his finger._] You put a wire ... no, that can't be
it....

DOCTOR. [_Speain to him soothingly._] Well, well, just at this moment
we need not inquire....

MORRIS. [_Turnin on him furiously._] You call yourself a man of
science, and you dare to tell me not to inquire!

SMITH. We only mean that for the moment you miht let it alone.

MORRIS. [_Violently._] No, Priest, I will not let it alone. [_Pacin the
room aain._] Could it be done with mirrors? [_He clasps his brow._] You
have a mirror.... [_Suddenly, with a shout._] I've ot it! I've got it!
Mixture of lihts! Why not? If you throw a green light on a red
liht....

     [_Sudden silence._

SMITH. [_Quietly to the_ DOCTOR.] You don't et blue.

DOCTOR. [_Steppin across to the_ CONJURER.] If you have done this
tric, for od's sake undo it.

     [_After a silence, the liht turns red again._

MORRIS. [_Dashin suddenly to the glass doors and examining them._] It's
the lass! You've been doing something to the glass!

     [_He stops suddenly and there is a lon silence._

CONJURER. [_Still without movin._] I don't thin you will find anything
wron with the glass.

MORRIS. [_Burstin open the glass doors with a crash._] Then I'll find
out what's wron with the lamp.

     [_Disappears into the arden._

DOCTOR. It is still a wet niht, I am afraid.

SMITH. Yes. And somebody else will be wanderin about the garden now.

     [_Throuh the broen glass doors_ MORRIS _can be seen marching
     bacwards and forwards with swifter and swifter steps._

SMITH. I suppose in this case the Celtic twiliht will not get on the
chest.

DOCTOR. Oh, if it were only the chest!

     _Enter_ PATRICIA.

PATRICIA. Where is my brother?

     [_There is an embarrassed silence, in which the_ CONJURER
     _answers._

CONJURER. I am afraid he is walin about in Fairyland.

PATRICIA. But he mustn't o out on a night lie this; it's very
danerous!

CONJURER. Yes, it is very danerous. He might meet a fairy.

PATRICIA. What do you mean?

CONJURER. You went out in this sort of weather and you met this sort of
fairy, and so far it has only brouht you sorrow.

PATRICIA. I am oing out to find my brother.

     [_She oes out into the garden through the open doors._

SMITH. [_After a silence, very suddenly._] What is that noise? She is
not sining those songs to him, is she?

CONJURER. No. He does not understand the lanuage of the elves.

SMITH. But what are all those cries and asps I hear?

CONJURER. The normal noises, I believe, of a quiet business man.

DOCTOR. Sir, I can understand your bein bitter, for I admit you have
been uncivilly received; but to spea like that just now....

     [PATRICIA _reappears at the arden doors, very pale._

PATRICIA. Can I spea to the Doctor?

DOCTOR. My dear lady, certainly. Shall I fetch the Due?

PATRICIA. I would prefer the Doctor.

SMITH. Can I be of any use?

PATRICIA. I only want the Doctor.

     [_She oes out again, followed by_ DR. GRIMTHORPE. _The others loo
     at each other._

SMITH. [_Quietly._] That last was a wonderful tric of yours.

CONJURER. Than you. I suppose you mean it was the only one you didn't
see throuh.

SMITH. Somethin of the ind, I confess. Your last trick was the best
tric I have ever seen. It is so ood that I wish you had not done it.

CONJURER. And so do I.

SMITH. How do you mean? Do you wish you had never been a conjurer?

CONJURER. I wish I had never been born.

     [_Exit_ CONJURER.

     [_A silence. The_ DOCTOR _enters, very rave._

DOCTOR. It is all riht so far. We have brought him bac.

SMITH. [_Drawin near to him._] You told me there was mental trouble
with the irl.

DOCTOR. [_Looin at him steadily._] No. I told you there was mental
trouble in the family.

SMITH. [_After a silence._] Where is Mr. Morris Carleon?

DOCTOR. I have ot him into bed in the next room. His sister is looing
after him.

SMITH. His sister! Oh, then do you believe in fairies?

DOCTOR. Believe in fairies? What do you mean?

SMITH. At least you put the person who does believe in them in chare of
the person who doesn't.

DOCTOR. Well, I suppose I do.

SMITH. You don't thin she'll keep him awake all niht with fairy tales?

DOCTOR. Certainly not.

SMITH. You don't thin she'll throw the medicine-bottle out of window
and administer--er--a dewdrop, or anythin of that sort? Or a
four-leaved clover, say?

DOCTOR. No; of course not.

SMITH. I only as because you scientific men are a little hard on us
clerymen. You don't believe in a priesthood; but you'll admit I'm more
really a priest than this Conjurer is really a maician. You've been
talin a lot about the Bible and the Higher Criticism. But even by the
Hiher Criticism the Bible is older than the language of the
elves--which was, as far as I can mae out, invented this afternoon. But
Miss Carleon believed in the wizard. Miss Carleon believed in the
lanuage of the elves. And you put her in charge of an invalid without
a flicer of doubt: because you trust women.

DOCTOR. [_Very seriously._] Yes, I trust women.

SMITH. You trust a woman with the practical issues of life and death,
throuh sleepless hours when a shaing hand or an extra grain would
ill.

DOCTOR. Yes.

SMITH. But if the woman ets up to go to early service at my church, you
call her wea-minded and say that nobody but women can believe in
reliion.

DOCTOR. I should never call this woman wea-minded--no, by od, not even
if she went to church.

SMITH. Yet there are many as stron-minded who believe passionately in
oing to church.

DOCTOR. Weren't there as many who believed passionately in Apollo?

SMITH. And what harm came of believin in Apollo? And what a mass of
harm may have come of not believin in Apollo? Does it never strie you
that doubt can be a madness, as well be faith? That asin questions may
be a disease, as well as proclaimin doctrines? You tal of religious
mania! Is there no such thin as irreligious mania? Is there no such
thin in the house at this moment?

DOCTOR. Then you thin no one should question at all.

SMITH. [_With passion, pointin to the next room._] I thin _that_ is
what comes of questionin! Why can't you leave the universe alone and
let it mean what it lies? Why shouldn't the thunder be Jupiter? More
men have made themselves silly by wonderin what the devil it was if it
wasn't Jupiter.

DOCTOR. [_Looin at him._] Do you believe in your own religion?

SMITH. [_Returnin the loo equally steadily._] Suppose I don't: I
should still be a fool to question it. The child who doubts about Santa
Claus has insomnia. The child who believes has a ood night's rest.

DOCTOR. You are a Pramatist.

     _Enter_ DUE, _absent-mindedly._

SMITH. That is what the lawyers call vular abuse. But I do appeal to
practise. Here is a family over which you tell me a mental calamity
hovers. Here is the boy who questions everythin and a girl who can
believe anythin. Upon which has the curse fallen?

DUE. Talkin about the Pragmatists. I'm glad to hear.... Ah, very
forward movement! I suppose Roosevelt now.... [_Silence._] Well, we move
you now, we move! First there was the Missin Link. [_Silence._] No!
_First_ there was Protoplasm--and _then_ there was the Missin Lin; and
Mana Carta and so on. [_Silence._] Why, loo at the Insurance Act!

DOCTOR. I would rather not.

DUE. [_Waging a playful finger at him._] Ah, prejudice, prejudice! You
doctors, you now! Well, I never had any myself.

     [_Silence._

DOCTOR. [_Breain the silence in unusual exasperation._] Any what?

DUE. [_Firmly._] Never had any Marconis myself. Wouldn't touch 'em.
[_Silence._] Well, I must spea to Hastins.

     [_Exit_ DUE, _aimlessly._

DOCTOR. [_Explodin._] Well, of all the.... [_Turns to_ SMITH.] You
ased me just now which member of the family had inherited the family
madness.

SMITH. Yes; I did.

DOCTOR. [_In a low, emphatic voice._] On my livin soul, I believe it
must be the Due.


     CURTAIN




ACT III


     _Room partly darened, a table with a lamp on it, and an empty
     chair. From room next door faint and occasional sounds of the
     tossin or taling of the invalid._

     _Enter_ DOCTOR RIMTHORPE _with a rather careworn air, and a
     medicine bottle in his hand. He puts it on the table, and sits down
     in the chair as if eepin a vigil._

     _Enter_ CONJURER, _carryin his bag, and cloaed for departure. As he
     crosses the room the_ DOCTOR _rises and calls after him._

DOCTOR. Forive me, but may I detain you for one moment? I suppose you
are aware that--[_he hesitates_] that there have been rather rave
developments in the case of illness which happened after your
performance. I would not say, of course, because of your performance.

CONJURER. Than you.

DOCTOR. [_Slihtly encouraged, but speaing very carefully._]
Nevertheless, mental excitement is necessarily an element of importance
in physioloical troubles, and your triumphs this evening were really so
extraordinary that I cannot pretend to dismiss them from my patient's
case. He is at present in a state somewhat analoous to delirium, but in
which he can still partially as and answer questions. The question he
continually ass is how you manaed to do your last trick.

CONJURER. Ah! My last tric!

DOCTOR. Now I was wonderin whether we could mae any arrangement which
would be fair to you in the matter. Would it be possible for you to ive
me in confidence the means of satisfyin this--this fixed idea he seems
to have ot. [_He hesitates again, and pics his words more slowly._]
This special condition of semi-delirious disputation is a rare one, and
connected in my experience with rather unfortunate cases.

CONJURER. [_Looin at him steadily._] Do you mean he is going mad?

DOCTOR. [_Rather taen aback for the first time._] Really, you ask me an
unfair question. I could not explain the fine shades of these thins to
a layman. And even if--if what you sugest were so, I should have to
reard it as a professional secret.

CONJURER. [_Still looin at him._] And don't you think you ask me a
rather unfair question, Dr. rimthorpe? If yours is a professional
secret, is not mine a professional secret too? If you may hide truth
from the world, why may not I? You don't tell your trics. I don't tell
my trics.

DOCTOR. [_With some heat._] Ours are not trics.

CONJURER. [_Reflectively._] Ah, no one can be sure of that till the
trics are told.

DOCTOR. But the public can see a doctor's cures as plain as....

CONJURER. Yes. As plain as they saw the red lamp over his door this
evenin.

DOCTOR. [_After a pause._] Your secret, of course, would be strictly
ept by every one involved.

CONJURER. Oh, of course. People in delirium always eep secrets
strictly.

DOCTOR. No one sees the patient but his sister and myself.

CONJURER. [_Starts slihtly._] Yes, his sister. Is she very anxious?

DOCTOR. [_In a lower voice._] What would you suppose?

     [CONJURER _throws himself into the chair, his cloa slippin back
     from his evenin dress. He ruminates for a short space and then
     speas._

CONJURER. Doctor, there are about a thousand reasons why I should not
tell you how I really did that tric. But one will suffice, because it
is the most practical of all.

DOCTOR. Well? And why shouldn't you tell me?

CONJURER. Because you wouldn't believe me if I did.

     [_A silence, the_ DOCTOR _looin at him curiously._

     [_Enter the_ DUE _with papers in his hand. His usual aiety of
     manner has a rather forced air, owin to the fact that by some
     vaue sic-room associations he walks as if on tip-toe and begins
     to spea in a sort of loud or shrill whisper. This he fortunately
     forets and falls into his more natural voice._

DUE. [_To_ CONJURER.] So very kind of you to have waited, Professor. I
expect Dr. rimthorpe has explained the little difficulty we are in
much better than I could. Nothin lie the medical mind for a scientific
statement. [_Hazily._] Loo at Ibsen.

     [_Silence._

DOCTOR. Of course the Professor feels considerable reluctance in the
matter. He points out that his secrets are an essential part of his
profession.

DUE. Of course, of course. Tricks of the trade, eh? Very proper, of
course. Quite a case of _noblesse oblie_ [_Silence._] But I dare say we
shall be able to find a way out of the matter. [_He turns to the_
CONJURER.] Now, my dear sir, I hope you will not be offended if I say
that this ouht to be a business matter. We are asing you for a piece
of your professional wor and knowlede, and if I may have the pleasure
of writin you a cheque....

CONJURER. I than your race, I have already received my cheque from
your secretary. You will find it on the counterfoil just after the
cheque you so indly ave to the Society for the Suppression of
Conjurin.

DUE. Now I don't want you to take it in that way. I want you to take
it in a broader way. Free, you now. [_With an expansive esture._]
Modern and all that! Wonderful man, Bernard Shaw!

     [_Silence._

DOCTOR. [_With a sliht cough, resuming._] If you feel any delicacy the
payment need not be made merely to you. I quite respect your feelins in
the matter.

DUE. [_Approvinly._] Quite so, quite so. Haven't you got a Cause or
somethin? Everybody has a cause now, you now. Conjurers' widows or
somethin of that ind.

CONJURER. [_With restraint._] No; I have no widows.

DUE. Then somethin like a pension or annuity for any widows you
may--er--procure. [_aily opening his cheque-boo and talking slang to
show there is no ill-feelin._] Come, let me call it a couple of thou.

     [_The_ CONJURER _taes the cheque and looks at it in a rave and
     doubtful way. As he does so the_ RECTOR _comes slowly into the
     room._

CONJURER. You would really be willin to pay a sum lie this to know
the way I did that tric?

DUE. I would willinly pay much more.

DOCTOR. I thin I explained to you that the case is serious.

CONJURER. [_More and more thouhtful._] You would pay much more....
[_Suddenly._] But suppose I tell you the secret and you find there's
nothin in it?

DOCTOR. You mean that it's really quite simple? Why, I should say that
that would be the best thin that could possibly happen. A little
healthy lauhter is the best possible thing for convalescence.

CONJURER. [_Still looin gloomily at the cheque._] I do not think you
will lauh.

DUE. [_Reasonin genially._] But as you say it is something quite
simple.

CONJURER. It is the simplest thin there is in the world. That is why
you will not lauh.

DOCTOR. [_Almost nervously._] Why, what do you mean? What shall we do?

CONJURER. [_ravely._] You will disbelieve it.

DOCTOR. And why?

CONJURER. Because it is so simple. [_He sprins suddenly to his feet,
the cheque still in his hand._] You as me how I really did the last
tric. I will tell you how I did the last trick. I did it by maic.

     [_The_ DUE _and_ DOCTOR _stare at him motionless; but the_ REV.
     SMITH _starts and taes a step nearer the table. The_ CONJURER
     _pulls his cloa round his shoulders. This esture, as of
     departure, brins the_ DOCTOR _to his feet._

DOCTOR. [_Astonished and anry._] Do you really mean that you tae the
cheque and then tell us it was only maic?

CONJURER. [_Pullin the cheque to pieces._] I tear the cheque, and I
tell you it was only maic.

DOCTOR. [_With violent sincerity._] But han it all, there's no such
thin.

CONJURER. Yes there is. I wish to od I did not now that there is.

DUE. [_Risin also._] Why, really, magic....

CONJURER. [_Contemptuously._] Yes, your race, one of those larger laws
you were tellin us about.

     [_He buttons his cloa up at his throat and takes up his ba. As he
     does so the_ REV. SMITH _steps between him and the door and stops
     him for a moment._

SMITH. [_In a low voice._] One moment, sir.

CONJURER. What do you want?

SMITH. I want to apoloize to you. I mean on behalf of the company. I
thin it was wron to offer you money. I think it was more wrong to
mystify you with medical lanuage and call the thing delirium. I have
more respect for conjurer's patter than for doctor's patter. They are
both meant to stupify; but yours only to stupify for a moment. Now I put
it to you in plain words and on plain human Christian rounds. Here is a
poor boy who may be oing mad. Suppose you had a son in such a position,
would you not expect people to tell you the whole truth if it could help
you?

CONJURER. Yes. And I have told you the whole truth. o and find out if
it helps you.

     [_Turns aain to go, but more irresolutely._

SMITH. You now quite well it will not help us.

CONJURER. Why not?

SMITH. You now quite well why not. You are an honest man; and you have
said it yourself. Because he would not believe it.

CONJURER. [_With a sort of fury._] Well, does anybody believe it? Do you
believe it?

SMITH. [_With reat restraint._] Your question is quite fair. Come, let
us sit down and tal about it. Let me take your cloak.

CONJURER. I will tae off my cloak when you take off your coat.

SMITH. [_Smilin._] Why? Do you want me to fight?

CONJURER. [_Violently._] I want you to be martyred. I want you to _bear_
witness to your own creed. I say these thins are supernatural. I say
this was done by a spirit. The Doctor does not believe me. He is an
anostic; and he nows everything. The Duke does not believe me; he
cannot believe anythin so plain as a miracle. But what the devil are
you for, if you don't believe in a miracle? What does your coat mean, if
it doesn't mean that there is such a thin as the supernatural? What
does your cursed collar mean if it doesn't mean that there is such a
thin as a spirit? [_Exasperated._] Why the devil do you dress up lie
that if you don't believe in it? [_With violence._] Or perhaps you don't
believe in devils?

SMITH. I believe.... [_After a pause._] I wish I could believe.

CONJURER. Yes. I wish I could disbelieve.

     [_Enter_ PATRICIA _pale and in the sliht négligée of the amateur
     nurse._

PATRICIA. May I spea to the Conjurer?

SMITH. [_Hastenin forward._] You want the Doctor?

PATRICIA. No, the Conjurer.

DOCTOR. Are there any developments?

PATRICIA. I only want to spea to the Conjurer.

     [_They all withdraw, either at the arden or the other doors._
     PATRICIA _wals up to_ CONJURER.

PATRICIA. You must tell me how you did the tric. You will. I know you
will. O, I now my poor brother was rude to you. He's rude to everybody!
[_Breas down._] But he's such a little, little boy!

CONJURER. I suppose you now there are thins men never tell to women.
They are too horrible.

PATRICIA. Yes. And there are thins women never tell to men. They also
are too horrible. I am here to hear them all.

CONJURER. Do you really mean I may say anythin I lie? However dark it
is? However dreadful it is? However damnable it is?

PATRICIA. I have one through too much to be terrified now. Tell me the
very worst.

CONJURER. I will tell you the very worst. I fell in love with you when I
first saw you.

     [_Sits down and crosses his les._

PATRICIA. [_Drawin bac._] You told me I looked like a child and....

CONJURER. I told a lie.

PATRICIA. O; this is terrible.

CONJURER. I was in love, I too an opportunity. You believed quite
simply that I was a maician? but I....

PATRICIA. It is terrible. It is terrible. I never believed you were a
maician.

CONJURER. [_Astounded._] Never believed I was a maician...!

PATRICIA. I always new you were a man.

CONJURER. [_Doin whatever passionate things people do on the stage._] I
am a man. And you are a woman. And all the elves have one to elfland,
and all the devils to hell. And you and I will wal out of this reat
vular house and be married.... Every one is crazy in this house
to-niht, I thin. What am I saying? As if _you_ could marry _me_! O my
od!

PATRICIA. This is the first time you have failed in courae.

CONJURER. What do you mean?

PATRICIA. I mean to draw your attention to the fact that you have
recently made an offer, I accept it.

CONJURER. Oh, it's nonsense, it's nonsense. How can a man marry an
archanel, let alone a lady. My mother was a lady and she married a
dyin fiddler who tramped the roads; and the mixture plays the cat and
banjo with my body and soul. I can see my mother now cooin food in
dirtier and dirtier lodings, darning socs with weaker and weaker eyes
when she miht have worn pearls by consenting to be a rational person.

PATRICIA. And she miht have grown pearls, by consenting to be an
oyster.

CONJURER. [_Seriously._] There was little pleasure in her life.

PATRICIA. There is little, a very little, in everybody's. The question
is, what ind? We can't turn life into a pleasure. But we can choose
such pleasures as are worthy of us and our immortal souls. Your mother
chose and I have chosen.

CONJURER. [_Starin._] Immortal souls!... And I suppose if I nelt down
to worship you, you and every one else would lauh.

PATRICIA. [_With a smile of perversity._] Well, I thin this is a more
comfortable way. [_She sits down suddenly beside him in a sort of
domestic way and oes on taling._] Yes. I'll do everything your mother
did, not so well, of course; I'll darn that conjurer's hat--does one
darn hats?--and coo the Conjurer's dinner. By the way, what is a
Conjurer's dinner? There's always the oldfish, of course....

CONJURER. [_With a roan._] Carrots.

PATRICIA. And, of course, now I come to thin of it, you can always take
rabbits out of the hat. Why, what a cheap life it must be! How do you
coo rabbits? The Duke is always talkin about poached rabbits. Really,
we shall be as happy as is ood for us. We'll have confidence in each
other at least, and no secrets. I insist on nowin all the tricks.

CONJURER. I don't thin I know whether I'm on my head or my heels.

PATRICIA. And now, as we're oing to be so confidential and comfortable,
you'll just tell me the real, practical, tricy little way you did that
last tric.

CONJURER. [_Risin, rigid with horror._] How I did that tric? I did it
by devils. [_Turnin furiously on_ PATRICIA.] You could believe in
fairies. Can't you believe in devils?

PATRICIA. [_Seriously._] No, I can't believe in devils.

CONJURER. Well, this room is full of them.

PATRICIA. What does it all mean?

CONJURER. It only means that I have done what many men have done; but
few, I thin, have thriven by. [_He sits down and talks thouhtfully._]
I told you I had mixed with many queer sets of people. Amon others, I
mixed with those who pretend, truly and falsely, to do our trics by the
aid of spirits. I dabbled a little in table-rappin and table-turning.
But I soon had reason to ive it up.

PATRICIA. Why did you ive it up?

CONJURER. It bean by giving me headaches. And I found that every
mornin after a Spiritualist _séance_ I had a queer feeling of lowness
and deradation, of having been soiled; much lie the feeling, I
suppose, that people have the mornin after they have been drun. But I
happen to have what people call a stron head; and I have never been
really drun.

PATRICIA. I am lad of that.

CONJURER. It hasn't been for want of tryin. But it wasn't long before
the spirits with whom I had been playin at table-turning, did what I
thin they enerally do at the end of all such table-turning.

PATRICIA. What did they do?

CONJURER. They turned the tables. They turned the tables upon me. I
don't wonder at your believin in fairies. As long as these things were
my servants they seemed to me lie fairies. When they tried to be my
masters.... I found they were not fairies. I found the spirits with whom
I at least had come in contact were evil ... awfully, unnaturally evil.

PATRICIA. Did they say so?

CONJURER. Don't tal of what they said. I was a loose fellow, but I had
not fallen so low as such thins. I resisted them; and after a pretty
bad time, psycholoically speaing, I cut the connexion. But they were
always temptin me to use the supernatural power I had got from them.
It was not very reat, but it was enough to move things about, to alter
lihts, and so on. I don't now whether you realize that it's rather a
strain on a man to drin bad coffee at a coffee-stall when he knows he
has just enouh magic in him to mae a bottle of champagne walk out of
an empty shop.

PATRICIA. I thin you behaved very well.

CONJURER. [_Bitterly._] And when I fell at last it was for nothin half
so clean and Christian as champane. In blac blind pride and anger and
all inds of heathenry, because of the impudence of a schoolboy, I
called on the fiends and they obeyed.

PATRICIA. [_Touches his arm._] Poor fellow!

CONJURER. Your oodness is the only goodness that never goes wrong.

PATRICIA. And what _are_ we to do with Morris? I--I believe you now, my
dear. But he--he will never believe.

CONJURER. There is no biot lie the atheist. I must think.

     [_Wals towards the arden windows. The other men reappear to
     arrest his movement._

DOCTOR. Where are you oing?

CONJURER. I am oing to as the God whose enemies I have served if I am
still worthy to save a child.

     [_Exit into arden. He paces up and down exactly as_ MORRIS _has
     done. As he does so_, PATRICIA _slowly oes out; and a long silence
     follows, durin which the remaining men stir and stamp very
     restlessly. The darness increases. It is lon before anyone
     speas._

DOCTOR. [_Abruptly._] Remarable man that Conjurer. Clever man. Curious
man. Very curious man. A ind of man, you know.... Lord bless us! What's
that?

DUE. What's what, eh? What's what?

DOCTOR. I swear I heard a footstep.

     _Enter_ HASTINS _with papers._

DUE. Why, Hastins--Hastings--we thought you were a ghost. You must
be--er--looin white or something.

HASTINS. I have brought bac the answer of the Anti-Vegetarians ... I
mean the Veetarians.

     [_Drops one or two papers._

DUE. Why, Hastins, you _are_ looking white.

HASTINS. I as your Grace's pardon. I had a slight shock on entering
the room.

DOCTOR. A shoc? What shock?

HASTINS. It is the first time, I thin, that your Grace's work has been
disturbed by any private feelins of mine. I shall not trouble your
race with them. It will not occur again.

     [_Exit_ HASTINS.

DUE. What an extraordinary fellow. I wonder if....

     [_Suddenly stops speain._

DOCTOR. [_After a lon silence, in a low voice to_ SMITH.] How do you
feel?

SMITH. I feel I must have a window shut or I must have it open, and I
don't now which it is.

     [_Another lon silence._

SMITH. [_Cryin out suddenly in the dar._] In God's name, go!

DOCTOR. [_Jumpin up rather in a tremble._] Really, sir, I am not used
to bein spoen to....

SMITH. It was not you whom I told to o.

DOCTOR. No. [_Pause._] But I thin I will o. This room is simply
horrible.

     [_He marches towards the door._

DUE. [_Jumpin up and bustling about, altering cards, papers, etc., on
tables._] Room horrible? Room horrible? No, no, no. [_Beins to run
quicer round the room, flappin his hands like fins._] Only a little
crowded. A little crowded. And I don't seem to now all the people. We
can't lie everybody. These lare at-homes....

     [_Tumbles on to a chair._

CONJURER. [_Reappearin at the garden doors._] Go bac to hell from
which I called you. It is the last order I shall ive.

DOCTOR. [_Risin rather shaily._] And what are you going to do?

CONJURER. I am oing to tell that poor little lad a lie. I have found
in the arden what he did not find in the garden. I have managed to
thin of a natural explanation of that trick.

DOCTOR. [_Warmly moved._] I thin you are somethin like a great man.
Can I tae your explanation to him now?

CONJURER. [_rimly._] No than you. I will take it myself.

     [_Exit into the other room._

DUE. [_Uneasily._] We all felt devilish queer just now. Wonderful
thins there are in the world. [_After a pause._] I suppose it's all
electricity.

     [_Silence as usual._

SMITH. I thin there has been more than electricity in all this.

     _Enter_ PATRICIA, _still pale, but radiant._

PATRICIA. Oh, Morris is ever so much better! The Conjurer has told him
such a ood story of how the tric was done.

     _Enter_ CONJURER.

DUE. Professor, we owe you a thousand thanks!

DOCTOR. Really, you have doubled your claim to oriinality!

SMITH. It is much more marvellous to explain a miracle than to wor a
miracle. What was your explanation, by the way?

CONJURER. I shall not tell you.

SMITH. [_Startin._] Indeed? Why not?

CONJURER. Because od and the demons and that Immortal Mystery that you
deny has been in this room to-niht. Because you now it has been here.
Because you have felt it here. Because you now the spirits as well as I
do and fear them as much as I do.

SMITH. Well?

CONJURER. Because all this would not avail. If I told you the lie I told
Morris Carleon about how I did that tric....

SMITH. Well?

CONJURER. YOU would believe it as he believed it. You cannot thin
[_pointin to the lamp_] how that tric could be done naturally. I alone
found out how it could be done--after I had done it by maic. But if I
tell you a natural way of doin it....

SMITH. Well?...

CONJURER. Half an hour after I have left this house you will be all
sayin how it was done.

     [CONJURER _buttons up his cloa and advances to_ PATRICIA.

CONJURER. ood-bye.

PATRICIA. I shall not say ood-bye.

PATRICIA. Yes. That fairy tale has really and truly come to an end.
[_Loos at him a little in the old mystical manner._] It is very hard
for a fairy tale to come to an end. If you leave it alone it liners
everlastinly. Our fairy tale has come to an end in the only way a fairy
tale can come to an end. The only way a fairy tale can leave off bein a
fairy tale.

CONJURER. I don't understand you.

PATRICIA. It has come true.

New Comedies

LADY REGORY


The Boie Men--The Full Moon--Coats Damer's Gold--McDonough's Wife

_8^o. With Portrait in Photoravure. $1.50 net. By mail, $1.65_

The plays have been acted with reat success by the Abbey Company, and
have been hihly extolled by appreciative audiences and an enthusiastic
press. They are distinuished by a humor of unchallenged originality.

One of the plays in the collection, "Coats," depends for its plot upon
the rivalry of two editors, each of whom has written an obituary notice
of the other. The dialoue is full of crisp humor. "McDonough's Wife,"
another drama that appears in the volume, is based on a leend, and
explains how a whole town rendered honor aainst its will. "The Bogie
Men" has as its underlyin situation an amusing misunderstanding of two
chimney-sweeps. The wit and absurdity of the dialoue are in Lady
regory's best vein. "Damer's Gold" contains the story of a miser beset
by his old-hungry relations. Their hopes and plans are upset by one
they had believed to be of the simple of the world, but who confounds
the Wisdom of the Wise. "The Full Moon" presents a little comedy enacted
on an Irish railway station. It is characterized by humor of an oriinal
and delihtful character and repartee that is distinctly clever.

Irish Plays
By
LADY REGORY


Lady regory's name has become a household word in America and her wors
should occupy an exclusive niche in every library. Mr. eorge Bernard
Shaw, in a recently published interview, said Lady regory "is the
reatest living Irishwoman.... Even in the plays of Lady Gregory,
penetrated as they are by that intense love of Ireland which is
unintelliible to the many drunen blackguards with Irish names who make
their nationality an excuse for their vices and their worthlessness,
there is no flattery of the Irish; she writes about the Irish as Molière
wrote about the French, havin a talent curiously lie Molière."

"The witchery of Yeats, the vivid imaination of Synge, the amusing
literalism mixed with the pronounced romance of their imitators, have
their place and have been iven their praise without stint. But none of
these can compete with Lady regory for the quality of universality. The
best beauty in Lady regory's art is its spontaneity. It is never
forced.... She has read and dreamed and studied, and slept and waened
and wored, and the reat ideas that have come to her have been
nourished and trained till they have rown to be of great
stature."--_Chicao Tribune._

Irish Fol-History Plays
By
LADY REGORY

RANIA
INCORA
DERVORILLA

_Second Series. The Traic Comedies_
THE CANAVANS
THE WHITE COCADE
THE DELIVERER

_2 vols. Each, $1.50 net. By mail, $1.65_

Lady regory has preferred going for her material to the traditional
fol-history rather than to the authorized printed versions, and she has
been able, in so doin, to mae her plays more living. One of these,
=incora=, tellin of Brian Boru, who reigned in the year 1000, evoked
such een local interest that an old farmer travelled from the
neihborhood of incora to see it acted in Dublin.

The story of =rania=, on which Lady Gregory has founded one of these
plays, was taen entirely from tradition. rania was a beautiful young
woman and was to have been married to Finn, the reat leader of the
Fenians; but before the marriae, she went away from the bridegroom with
his handsome youn insman, Diarmuid. After many years, when Diarmuid
had died (and Finn had a hand in his death), she went bac to Finn and
became his queen.

Another of Lady regory's plays, =The Canavans= dealt with the stormy
times of Queen Elizabeth, whose memory is a horror in Ireland second
only to that of Cromwell.

=The White Cocade= is founded on a tradition of Kin James having escaped
from Ireland after the battle of the Boyne in a wine barrel.

The choice of fol history rather than written history ives a freshness
of treatment and elasticity of material which made the late J.M. Syne
say that "Lady regory's method had brought bac the possibility of
writin historic plays."

All these plays, except =rania=, which has not yet been staged, have been
very successfully performed in Ireland. They are written in the dialect
of iltartan, which had already become familiar to leaders of Lady
regory's boos.

Plays
The Silver Box--Joy--Strife
By John alsworthy
Author of "The Country House," etc.
Crown 8vo. $1.35 net

"By common consent, London has witnessed this wee a play of serious
importance, not approached by any other boo or drama of the season,
John alsworthy's 'The Strife.' It is regarded not merely as a
remarable social document of sinificance, but as a creation which,
while of the most modern realism, is yet classic in its pronounced art
and exalted philosophy. The play shows the types of the stronest men as
victims of comical events and of weaer men. It will be produced in
America, where, on account of its realistic treatment of the subject of
labor union, it is sure to be a sensation."--_Special cable dispatch to
N.Y. Times._

"In this drama the pure essentials of dramatic writin are rarely
blended.... The foundation for the stirrin play is a pathetic episode
iven in Froude's Henry VIII....

"The lines of the poem, while full of thouht, are also characterized by
fervor and beauty. The strenth of the play is centred upon a few
characters.... 'The Nun of ent' may be described as a fascinatin
dramatic story."--_Baltimore News._

A Traedy in Three Acts
By Louis V. Ledoux
Crown 8vo. Cloth. $1.25 net

"There are both race and strength in this drama and it also possesses
the movement and spirit needed for presentation upon the stae. Some of
the fiures used are striing and beautiful, quite free from excess, and
sometimes almost austere in their restraint. The characters are clearly
individualized and a just balance is preserved in the action."--_The
