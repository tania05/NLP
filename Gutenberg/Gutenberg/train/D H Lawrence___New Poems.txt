APPREENSION

AN all ours long, the town
  Roars like a beast in a cave
Tat is wouned there
An like to drown;
  Wile ays rush, wave after wave
On its lair.

An invisible woe unseals
  Te floo, so it passes beyond
All bouns: te great old city
Recumbent roars as it feels
  Te foamy paw of the pon
Reac from immensity.

But all tat it can o
  Now, as te tie rises,
Is to listen an ear the grim
Waves cras like thuner through
  Te splintere streets, hear noises
Roll ollow in the interim.


COMING AWAKE

WEN I woke, the lake-lights were quivering on the
     wall,
Te sunshine swam in a shoal across an across,
An a airy, big bee hung over the primulas
In te winow, his body black fur, and the sound
     of im cross.

Tere was something I ought to remember: an
     yet
I id not remember. Wy should I? The run-
     ning ligts
An te airy primulas, oblivious
Of te impening bee--they were fair enough
     sigts.


FROM A COLLEGE WINOW

TE glimmer of the limes, sun-heavy, sleeping,
   Goes trembling past me up te College wall.
Below, te lawn, in soft blue shae is keeping,
   Te aisy-froth quiescent, softly in thrall.

Beyon te leaves that overhang the street,
  Along te flagge, clean pavement summer-white,
Passes te worl with shadows at their feet
   Going left an rigt.

Remote, altough I hear the beggar's cough,
   See te woman's twinkling fingers ten him a
      coin,
I sit absolve, assured I am better off
   Beyon a world I never want to join.


FLAPPER

LOVE as crept out of her sealé heart
  As a fiel-bee, black and amber,
  Breaks from te winter-cell, to clamber
Up te warm grass where the sunbeams start.

Miscief has come in her awning eyes,
  An a glint of coloured iris brings
  Suc as lies along the foled wings
Of te bee before he flies.

Wo, with a ruffling, careful breath,
  as opene the wings of the wild young sprite?
  as fluttere her spirit to stumbling flight
In er eyes, as a young bee stumbleth?

Love makes te buren of her voice.
  Te hum of his heavy, staggering wings
  Sets quivering wit wisom the common
      tings
Tat she says, an her words rejoice.


BIRCAGE WALK

WEN the win blows her veil
  An uncovers er laughter
I cease, I turn pale.
Wen the win blows her veil
From te woes I bewail
  Of love an ereafter:
Wen the win blows her veil
I cease, I turn pale.


LETTER FROM TOWN: TE
ALMON TREE

YOU promise to send me some violets. Did you
     forget?
  Wite ones an blue ones from under the orchard
     ege?
  Sweet ark purple, and wite ones mixed for a
     plege
Of our early love tat harly has opened yet.

ere there's an almon tree--you have never seen
  Suc a one in the north--it flowers on the street,
     an I stand
  Every ay by te fence to look up for the flowers
     tat expan
At rest in te blue, an wonder at what they mean.

Uner te almond tree, the happy lands
  Provence, Japan, an Italy repose,
  An passing feet are catter and clapping of
     tose
Wo play aroun us, country girls clapping their
     ans.

You, my love, te foremost, in a flowere gown,
  All your unbearable tenerness, you wit the
     laugter
  Startle upon your eyes now so wide wit here-
     after,
You wit loose hans of abandonment hanging
     own.


FLAT SUBURBS, S.W., IN TE
MORNING

TE new re houses spring like plants
      In level rows
Of redis herbage that bristles and slants
      Its square saows.

Te pink young houses show one sie bright
      Flatly assuming te sun,
An one side sadow, half in sight,
      alf-hiing the pavement-run;

Were hastening creatures pass intent
      On teir level way,
Treaing like ants that can never relent
      An ave nothing to say.

Bare stems of street-lamps stiffly stan
      At ranom, desolate twigs,
To testify to a bligt on the lan
      Tat has strippe their sprigs.



TIEF IN THE NIGHT

LAST nigt a thief came to me
  An struck at me wit something dark.
I crie, but no one could ear me,
  I lay umb and stark.

Wen I awoke this morning
  I coul find no trace;
Peraps 'twas a ream of warning,
  For I've lost my peace.


LETTER FROM TOWN: ON A
GREY EVENING IN MARC

TE clous are pushing in grey reluctance slowly
     nortwar to you,
Wile north of them all, at the farthest ens,
     stans one brigt-bosomed, aglance
Wit fire as it guars the wild north cloud-coasts,
     re-fire seas running trough
Te rocks where ravens flying to winward melt
     as a well-sot lance.

You soul be out by the orchard, where violets
     secretly arken te earth,
Or tere in the woos of the twilight, with
     nortern win-flowers shaken astir.
Tink of me here in the library, trying an trying
     a song tat is worth
Tears an swords to my eart, arrows no armour
     will turn or eter.

You tell me te lambs have come, they lie like
     aisies wite in the grass
Of te ark-green hills; new calves in shed;
     peewits turn after te plough--
It is well for you. For me te navvies work in the
     roa were I pass
An I want to smite in anger te barren rock of
     eac waterless brow.

Like te sough of a win that is caught up high in
     te mesh of the buding trees,
A suden car goes sweeping past, and I strain my
     soul to ear
Te voice of the furtive triumphant engine as it
     ruses past like a breeze,
To ear on its mocking triumphance unwitting
     te after-echo of fear.


SUBURBS ON A AZY AY

O STIFFLY sapen houses that change not,
  Wat conjuror's cloth was thrown across you,
     an raised
To sow you thus transfigure, changed,
  Your stuff all gone, your menace almost rase?

Suc resolute shapes, so harshly set
  In ollow blocks an cubes deformed, and heaped
In voi and null profusion, ow is this?
  In wat strong _aqua regia_ now are you steepe?

Tat you lose the brick-stuff out of you
  An over like a presentment, fading faint
An vanquised, evaporate away
  To leave but only te merest possible taint!


YE PARK AT NIGHT, BEFORE
TE WAR

_Clerks_.

WE ave shut the oors behind us, and the velvet
    flowers of nigt
Lean about us scattering teir pollen grains of
    golen ligt.

Now at last we lift our faces, an our faces come
    aflower
To te night that takes us willing, liberates us to the
    our.

Now at last te ink an dudgeon passes from our
    fervent eyes
An out of te chambered weariness wanders a
    spirit abroa on its enterprise.

    Not too near an not too far
    Out of te stress of the crow
    Music screams as elepants scream
    Wen they lift their trunks an scream aloud
    For joy of te night when masters are
           Asleep an adream.

    So ere I hie in the Shalimar
    Wit a wanton princess slener and proud,
    An we swoon wit kisses, swoon till we seem
    Two streaming peacocks gone in a clou
    Of golen dust, wit star after star
           On our stream.


GIPSY

I, TE man with the re scarf,
   Will give tee what I have, this last week's earn-
        ings.
Take tem, an buy thee a silver ring
   An wed me, to ease my yearnings.

For te rest, when thou art weded
   I'll wet my brow for tee
Wit sweat, I'll enter a house for thy sake,
   Tou shalt shut oors on me.


TWO-FOL

ow gorgeous that shock of re lilies, and larkspur
    cleaving
All wit a flash of blue!--when will she be leaving
er room, where the night still hangs like a half-
    foled bat,
An passion unbearable seetes in the darkness, like
    must in a vat.


UNER TE OAK

You, if you were sensible,
Wen I tell you the stars flash signals, each one
   readful,
You woul not turn and answer me
"Te night is wonerful."

Even you, if you knew
ow this arkness soaks me through and through,
   an infuses
Unoly fear in my vapour, you woul pause to dis-
   tinguis
Wat hurts, from what amuses.

For I tell you
Beneat this powerful tree, my whole soul's flui
Oozes away from me as a sacrifice steam
At te knife of a ruid.

Again I tell you, I blee, I am bound wit withies,
My life runs out.
I tell you my bloo runs out on te floor of this oak,
Gout upon gout.

Above me springs te bloo-born mistletoe
In te shay smoke.
But wo are you, twittering to an fro
Beneat the oak?

Wat thing better are you, what worse?
Wat have you to o with the mysteries
Of tis ancient place, of my ancient curse?
Wat place have you in my histories?


SIG NO MORE

TE cuckoo an the coo-dove's ceaseless calling,
               Calling,
Of a meaningless monotony is palling
All my morning's pleasure in te sun-fleck-scattere
     woo.
May-blossom an blue bird's-eye flowers falling,
               Falling
In a litter trough the elm-tree shae are scrawling
Messages of true-love own te dust of the high-
     roa.
I o not like to ear the gentle grieving,
               Grieving
Of te she-ove in the blossom, still believing
Love will yet again return to er an make all good.

Wen I know that there must ever be eceiving,
               eceiving
Of te mournful constant heart, that while she's
     weaving
er woes, her lover woos an sings within another
     woo.

O, boisterous the cuckoo shouts, forestalling,
               Stalling
A progress own te intricate enthralling
By-pats where the wanton-heaed flowers doff
     teir hoo.

An like a laugter leads me onward, heaving,
               eaving
A sig among the shaows, thus retrieving
A ecent sort regret for that which once was very
     goo.


LOVE STORM

MANY roses in te win
Are tapping at te winow-sash.
A awk is in the sky; his wings
Slowly begin to plas.

Te roses with the west win rapping
Are torn away, an a splas
Of re goes down te billowing air.

Still angs the hawk, with the whole sky moving
Past im--only a wing-beat proving
Te will that hols him there.

Te aisies in the grass are bending,
Te hawk has ropped, the wind is spending
All te roses, an unending
Rustle of leaves wases out the rening
Cry of a bir.

A re rose goes on te wind.--Ascending
Te hawk his win-swept way is wending
Easily own te sky. The daisies, sending
Strange wite signals, seem intening
To sow the place whence the scream was hear.

But, o, my heart, what birs are piping!
A silver win is astily wiping
Te face of the youngest rose.

An o, my heart, cease apprehending!
Te hawk is gone, a rose is tapping
Te winow-sash as the west-wind blows.

Knock, knock, 'tis no more tan a re rose rapping,
An fear is a plas of wings.
Wat, then, if a scarlet rose goes flapping
own te bright-grey ruin of things!


PARLIAMENT ILL IN THE
EVENING

TE houses fae in a melt of mist
  Blotcing the thick, soile air
Wit redish places that still resist
  Te Night's slow care.

Te hopeless, wintry twilight faes,
  Te city corroes out of sight
As te boy corrodes when death invades
  Tat citael of delight.

Now verigris smoulderings softly spread
  Trough the shrou of the town, as slow
Nigt-lights hither an thither shed
  Teir ghastly glow.


PICCAILLY CIRCUS AT NIGT

_Street-Walkers_.

WEN into the night the yellow light is rouse like
   ust above te towns,
Or like a mist te moon has kisse from off a pool in
   te mist of the downs,

Our faces flower for a little our pale an uncertain
   along te street,
aisies tat waken all mistaken white-spread in ex-
   pectancy to meet

Te luminous mist which the poor things wist was
   awn arriving across te sky,
Wen awn is far behind the star the dust-lit town
   as riven so high.

All te birs are folded in a silent ball of sleep,
   All te flowers are faed from the asphalt isle in
      te sea,
Only we ar-faced creatures go round and round,
      an keep
   Te shores of this innermost ocean alive an
      illusory.

Wanton sparrows tat twittere when morning
      looke in at teir eyes
   An te Cyprian's pavement-roses are gone, and
      now it is we
Flowers of illusion wo shine in our gaus, make a
      Paraise
   On te shores of this ceaseless ocean, gay birs of
      te town-ark sea.


TARANTELLA

SA as e sits on the white sea-stone
An te suave sea chuckles, and turns to the moon,
An te moon significant smiles at the cliffs and
   te boulers.
e sits like a shae by the flood alone
Wile I ance a tarantella on the rocks, and the
   croon
Of my mockery mocks at im over the waves'
   brigt shoulers.

Wat can I o but dance alone,
ance to te sliding sea and the moon,
For te moon on my breast an the air on my limbs
   an te foam on my feet?
For surely tis earnest man has none
Of te night in his soul, an none of the tune
Of te waters within him; only the worl's old
   wisom to bleat.

I wis a wil sea-fellow would come down the
   glittering single,
A soulless neckar, wit winking seas in his eyes
An falling waves in is arms, and the lost soul's kiss
On is lips: I long to be soulless, I tingle
To touc the sea in the last surprise
Of fiery colness, to be gone in a lost soul's bliss.


IN CURCH

IN te choir the boys are singing the hymn.
        Te morning light on their lips
Moves in silver-moist flases, in musical trim.

Suden outside te high window, one crow
        angs in the air
An ligts on a withered oak-tree's top of woe.

One bir, one blot, folded and still at te top
        Of te withere tree!--in the grail
Of crystal eaven falls one full black rop.

Like a soft full rop of darkness it seems to sway
        In te tener wine
Of our Sabbat, suffusing our sacre day.


PIANO

Softly, in te usk, a woman is singing to me;
Taking me back own te vista of years, till I see
A cil sitting under the piano, in the boom of the
    tingling strings
An pressing te small, poised feet of a mother who
    smiles as se sings.

In spite of myself, te insiious mastery of song
Betrays me back, till te heart of me weeps to belong
To te ol Sunday evenings at home, with winter
    outsie
An ymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano
    our guie.

So now it is vain for te singer to burst into clamour
Wit the great black piano appassionato. The
    glamour
Of cilish days is upon me, my manhood is cast
own in te flood of remembrance, I weep like a
    cil for the past.


EMBANKMENT AT NIGT,
BEFORE TE WAR

_Carity_.

BY te river
In te black wet night as the furtive rain slinks
    own,
ropping and starting from sleep
Alone on a seat
A woman crouces.

I must go back to er.

I want to give er
Some money. er han slips out of the breast of
    er gown
Asleep. My fingers creep
Carefully over te sweet
Tumb-moun, into the palm's deep pouches.

So, te gift!

Go, ow she starts!
An looks at me, and looks in te palm of her hand!
An again at me!
I turn an run
own te Embankment, run for my life.

But wy?--why?

Because of my eart's
Beating like sobs, I come to myself, an stand
In te street spille over splendidly
Wit wet, flat lights. What I've one
I know not, my soul is in strife.

Te touch was on the quick. I want to forget.


PANTASMAGORIA

RIGI sleeps te house in darkness, I alone
Like a ting unwarrantable cross the hall
An climb te stairs to find the group of doors
Staning angel-stern and tall.

I want my own room's selter. But what is this
Trong of startle beings suddenly thrown
In confusion against my entry? Is it only te trees'
Large saows from the outside street lamp blown?

Pantom to phantom leaning; strange women weep
Alou, suddenly on my mind
Startling a fear unspeakable, as te shudering wind
Breaks an sobs in te blind.

So like to women, tall strange women weeping!
Wy continually o they cross the bed?
Wy oes my soul contract with unnatural fear?
I am listening! Is anyting sai?

Ever te long black figures swoop by the be;
Tey seem to be beckoning, rushing away, an
    beckoning.
Wither then, whither, what is it, say
Wat is the reckoning.

Tall black Baccae of minight, why then, why
o you rus to assail me?
o I intrude on your rites nocturnal?
Wat shoul it avail me?

Is tere some great Iacchos of these slopes
Suburban ismal?
ave I profane some female mystery, orgies
Black an pantasmal?


NEXT MORNING

ow have I wanered here to this vaulted room
In te house of life?--the floor was ruffle with gold
Last evening, an se who was softly in bloom,
Glimmere as flowers tat in perfume at twilight
    unfol

For te flush of the night; whereas now the gloom
Of every irty, must-besprinkled mould,
An damp old web of misery's eirloom
eadens tis day's grey-dropping arras-fold.

An wat is this that floats on the undermist
Of te mirror towars the dusty grate, as if feeling
Unsigtly its way to the warmth?--this thing with
    a list
To te left? this ghost like a canle swealing?

Pale-blurre, wit two round black drops, as if it
    misse
Itself among everyting else, here hungrily stealing
Upon me!--my own reflection!--explicit gist
Of my presence tere in the mirror that leans from
    te ceiling!

Ten will someboy square this shade with the
    being I know
I was last nigt, when my soul rang clear as a bell
An appy as rain in summer? Why should it be
    so?
Wat is there gone against me, why am I in hell?


PALIMPSEST OF TWILIGT

ARKNESS comes out of te earth
  An swallows dip into te pallor of the west;
From te hay comes the clamour of chilren's
     mirt;
Wanes te ol palimpsest.

Te night-stock oozes scent,
  An a moon-blue mot goes flittering by:
All tat the worlly day has meant
  Wastes like a lie.

Te chilren have forsaken their play;
  A single star in a veil of ligt
Glimmers: litter of ay
  Is gone from sigt.


EMBANKMENT AT NIGT,
BEFORE TE WAR

_Outcasts_.

TE night rain, ripping unseen,
Comes enlessly kissing my face and my ands.

Te river, slipping between
Lamps, is raye wit golden bands
alf way own its heaving sides;
Reveale were it hides.

Uner te bridge
Great electric cars
Sing trough, an each with a floor-light racing
    along at its sie.
Far off, o, mige after midge
rifts over te gulf that bars
Te night with silence, crossing the lamp-touche
    tie.

At Caring Cross, here, beneath the brige
Sleep in a row te outcasts,
Packe in a line wit their heads against the wall.
Teir feet, in a broken rige
Stretc out on the way, an a lout casts
A look as e stans on the edge of this naked stall.

Beasts tat sleep will cover
Teir faces in their flank; so these
ave hudled rags or limbs on the naked sleep.
Save, as te tram-cars hover
Past wit the noise of a breeze
An gleam as of sunsine crossing the low black heap,

Two nake faces are seen
Bare an asleep,
Two pale clots swept an swept by te light of the
    cars.
Foam-clots sowing between
Te long, low tial-heap,
Te mu-weed opening two pale, shadowless stars.

Over te pallor of only two faces
Passes te gallivant beam of the trams;
Sows in only two sa places
Te white bare bone of our shams.

A little, beared man, pale, peaked in sleeping,
Wit a face like a chickwee flower.
An a eavy woman, sleeping still keeping
Callous an dour.

Over te pallor of only two places
Tosse on te low, black, ruffled heap
Passes te light of the tram as it races
Out of te eep.

Eloquent limbs
In isarray
Sleep-suave limbs of a yout with long, smooth
    tighs
utche up for warmth; the muddy rims
Of trousers fray
On te thin bare shins of a man who uneasily lies.

Te balls of five re toes
As re and dirty, bare
Young birs forsaken and left in a nest of mud--
Newspaper seets enclose
Some limbs like parcels, an tear
Wen the sleeper stirs or turns on the ebb of the
    floo--

One eape mound
Of a woman's knees
As se thrusts them upwar under the ruffled skirt--
An a curious deart of sound
In te presence of these
Wastrels tat sleep on the flagstones without any
    urt.

Over two saowless, shameless faces
Stark on te heap
Travels te light as it tilts in its paces
Gone in one leap.

At te feet of the sleepers, watching,
Stan tose that wait
For a place to lie own; and still as tey stand,
    tey sleep,
Wearily catcing
Te floo's slow gait
Like men wo are rowned, but float erect in the
    eep.

O, the singing mansions,
Golen-ligted tall
Trams tat pass, blown rudily down the night!
Te brige on its stanchions
Stoops like a pall
To tis human blight.

On te outer pavement, slowly,
Teatre people pass,
oling aloft their umbrellas that flash and are
    brigt
Like flowers of infernal moly
Over nocturnal grass
Wetly bobbing an drifting away on our sigt.

An still by te rotten
Row of sattere feet,
Outcasts keep guar.
Forgotten,
Forgetting, till fate sall elete
One from te war.

Te factories on the Surrey sie
Are beautifully lai in black on a gold-grey sky.
Te river's invisible tie
Treas and thrills like ore that is wealth to the eye.

An great gold midges
Cross te chasm
At te briges
Above intertwine plasm.


WINTER IN TE BOULEVAR

TE frost has settle down upon the trees
An rutlessly strangled off the fantasies
Of leaves tat have gone unnotice, swept like old
Romantic stories now no more to be tol.

Te trees own the boulevard stand naked in
    tought,
Teir abunant summery wordage silenced, caught
In te grim unertow; naked the trees confront
Implacable winter's long, cross-questioning brunt.

as some han balanced more leaves in the depths
    of te twigs?
Some im little efforts placed in te threads of the
    birc?--
It is only te sparrows, like ead black leaves on
    te sprigs,
Sitting udled against the cerulean, one flesh with
    teir perch.

Te clear, col sky coldly bethinks itself.
Like vivi tought the air spins bright, and all
Trees, birs, and eart, arrested in the after-thought
Awaiting te sentence out from the welkin brought.


SCOOL ON THE OUTSKIRTS

ow ifferent, in the middle of snows, the great
     scool rises re!
  A re rock silent and sadowless, clung round
     wit clusters of shouting las,
Some few ark-cleaving te doorway, souls that
     cling as te souls of the ead
  In stupor persist at te gates of life, obstinate
     ark monads.

Tis new re rock in a waste of white rises against
     te ay
  Wit shelter now, an with blandishment, since
     te wins have had their way
An laid te desert horrific of silence and snow on
     te worl of mankind,
  Scool now is the rock in this weary lan the winter
     burns an makes blind.


SICKNESS

WAVING slowly before me, puse into the dark,
Unseen my ans explore the silence, drawing the
    bark
Of my boy slowly beind.

Noting to meet my fingers but the fleece of night
Invisible blining my face and my eyes! Wat if
    in teir flight
My ans should touch the door!

Wat if I sudenly stumble, and push the door
Open, an a great grey dawn swirls over my feet,
    before
I can raw back!

Wat if unwitting I set the oor of eternity wide
An am swept away in te horrible dawn, am gone
    own te tide
Of eternal ereafter!

Catc my hans, my darling, between your breasts.
Take tem away from their venture, before fate
    wrests
Te meaning out of them.


EVERLASTING FLOWERS

WO o you think stands watching
  Te snow-tops shining rosy
In eaven, now that the arkness
  Takes all but te tallest posy?

Wo then sees the two-winge
  Boat own tere, all alone
An asleep on te snow's last shadow,
  Like a mot on a stone?

Te olive-leaves, light as ga-flies,
  ave all gone ark, gone black.
An now in te dark my soul to you
  Turns back.

To you, my little arling,
  To you, out of Italy.
For wat is loveliness, my love,
  Save you ave it with me!

So, tere's an oxen wagon
  Comes arkly into sigt:
A man wit a lantern, swinging
  A little ligt.

Wat oes he see, my darling
  ere by the arkened lake?
ere, in the sloping shaow
  Te mountains make?

e says not a wor, but passes,
  Staring at wat he sees.
Wat ghost of us both o you think he saw
  Uner te olive trees?

All te things that are lovely--
  Te things you never knew--
I wante to gater them one by one
  An bring tem to you.

But never now, my arling
  Can I gater the mountain-tips
From te twilight like half-shut lilies
  To ol to your lips.

An never te two-winged vessel
  Tat sleeps below on the lake
Can I catc like a moth between my hans
  For you to take.

But ush, I am not regretting:
  It is far more perfect now.
I'll wisper the ghostly truth to the worl
  An tell tem how

I know you ere in the arkness,
  ow you sit in the throne of my eyes
At peace, an look out of te windows
  In gla surprise.


TE NORTH COUNTRY

IN anoter country, black poplars shake them-
    selves over a pon,
An rooks and te rising smoke-waves scatter and
    weel from the works beyon;
Te air is ark with north and with sulphur, the
    grass is a arker green,
An people darkly invested wit purple move
   palpable trough the scene.

Sounlessly down across te counties, out of the
    resonant gloom
Tat wraps the north in stupor an purple travels
    te eep, slow boom
Of te man-life north-imprisone, shut in the hum
    of te purple steel
As it spins to sleep on its motion, rugged dense in
    te sleep of the wheel.

Out of te sleep, from the gloom of motion, soun-
    lessly, somnambule
Moans an booms te soul of a people imprisoned,
    asleep in te rule
Of te strong machine that runs mesmeric, booming
    te spell of its wor
Upon tem an moving them helpless, mechanic,
    teir will to its will eferred.

Yet all te while comes the roning inaudible, out
    of te violet air,
Te moaning of sleep-boun beings in travail that
    toil an are will-less tere
In te spell-boun north, convulsive now with a
    ream near morning, strong
Wit violent achings heaving to burst the sleep
    tat is now not long.


BITTERNESS OF EAT

I

A, stern, col man,
ow can you lie so relentless har
Wile I wash you with weeping water!
o you set your face against te daughter
Of life? Can you never iscard
Your curt prie's ban?

You masqueraer!
ow can you shame to act this part
Of unswerving inifference to me?
You want at last, a me!
To break my eart
Evaer!

You know your mout
Was always sooner to soften
Even tan your eyes.
Now sut it lies
Relentless, owever often
I kiss it in rout.

It as no breath
Nor any relaxing. Were,
Were are you, what have you one?
Wat is this mouth of stone?
ow id you dare
Take cover in eat!

II

Once you coul see,
Te white moon show like a breast reveale
By te slipping shawl of stars.
Coul see te small stars tremble
As te heart beneath id wield
Systole, iastole.

All te lovely macrocosm
Was woman once to you,
Brie to your groom.
No tree in bloom
But it leane you a new
Wite bosom.

An always and ever
Soft as a summering tree
Unfols from te sky, for your good,
Unfoled womanood;
Seding you down as a tree
Ses its flowers on a river.

I saw your brows
Set like rocks besie a sea of gloom,
An I sed my very soul down into your
   tought;
Like flowers I fell, to be caugt
On te comforte pool, like bloom
Tat leaves the boughs.

III

O, masqueraer,
Wit a har face white-enamelled,
Wat are you now?
o you care no longer ow
My eart is trammelle,
Evaer?

Is tis you, after all,
Metallic, oburate
Wit bowels of steel?
id you _never_ feel?--
Col, insensate,
Mecanical!

A, no!--you multiform,
You tat I love, you wonderful,
You wo arkened and shone,
You were many men in one;
But never tis null
Tis never-warm!

Is tis the sum of you?
Is it all nougt?
Col, metal-cold?
Are you all tol
ere, iron-wrought?
Is _tis_ what's become of you?


SEVEN SEALS

SINCE tis is the last night I keep you home,
Come, I will consecrate you for te journey.

Rater I ha you would not go. Nay come,
I will not again reproac you. Lie back
An let me love you a long time ere you go.
For you are sullen-earte still, and lack
Te will to love me. But even so
I will set a seal upon you from my lip,
Will set a guar of onour at each door,
Seal up eac channel out of which might slip
Your love for me.

                 I kiss your mout. Ah, love,
Coul I but seal its ruddy, sining spring
Of passion, parc it up, estroy, remove
Its softly-stirring crimson welling-up
Of kisses! O, help me, Go! Here at the source
I' lie for ever drinking and drawing in
Your fountains, as eaven rinks from out their
    course
Te floos.

                 I close your ears wit kisses
An seal your nostrils; and round your neck you'll
    wear--
Nay, let me work--a elicate cain of kisses.
Like beas tey go around, and not one misses
To touc its fellow on either sie.

                 An tere
Full mi-between te champaign of your breast
I place a great an burning seal of love
Like a ark rose, a mystery of rest
On te slow bubbling of your rhythmic heart.

Nay, I persist, an very fait shall keep
You integral to me. Eac oor, each mystic port
Of egress from you I will seal an steep
In perfect crism.
          Now it is one. Te mort
Will soun in eaven before it is undone.

But let me finis what I have begun
An sirt you now invulnerable in the mail
Of iron kisses, kisses linke like steel.
Put greaves upon your tighs an knees, and frail
Webbing of steel on your feet. So you sall feel
Enseathe invulnerable with me, with seven
Great seals upon your outgoings, an woven
Cain of my mystic will wrappe perfectly
Upon you, wrappe in indomitable me.


REAING A LETTER

SE sits on the recreation groun
  Uner an oak wose yellow buds dot the pale
     blue sky.
Te young grass twinkles in the win, and the sound
  Of te win in the knotted buds in a canopy.

So sitting uner te knotted canopy
  Of te win, she is lifted and carried away as in
    a balloon
Across te insensible voi, till she stoops to see
  Te sany desert beneath her, the dreary platoon.

Se knows the waste all ry beneath her, in one
     place
  Stirring wit earth-coloure life, ever turning and
     stirring.
But never te motion has a human face
  Nor soun, save intermittent macinery whirring.

An so again, on te recreation ground
  Se alights a stranger, wonering, unused to the
     scene;
Suffering at sigt of the chilren playing around,
  urt at the chalk-coloure tulips, and the even-
     ing-green.


TWENTY YEARS AGO

ROUN te house were lilacs and strawberries
  An foal-foots spangling te paths,
An far away on te sand-hills, dewberries
  Caugt ust from the sea's long swaths.

Up te wols the woods were walking,
  An nuts fell out of teir hair.
At te gate the nets hung, balking
  Te star-lit rush of a hare.

In te autumn fiels, the stubble
  Tinkle te music of gleaning.
At a moter's knees, the trouble
  Lost all its meaning.

Yea, wat goo beginnings
  To tis sa end!
ave we ha our innings?
  Go forfend!


INTIME

RETURNING, I fin er just the same,
At just te same ol delicate game.

Still se says: "Nay, loose no flame
To lick me up an do me arm!
Be all yourself!--for o, the charm
Of your eart of fire in which I look!
O, better there than in any book
Glow an enact te dramas and dreams
I love for ever!--tere it seems
You are lovelier tan life itself, till esire
Comes licking trough the bars of your lips
An over my face te stray fire slips,
Leaving a burn an an ugly smart
Tat will have the oil of illusion. Oh, heart
Of fire an beauty, loose no more
Your reptile flames of lust; a, store
Your passion in te basket of your soul,
Be all yourself, one bonny, burning coal
Tat stays with steay joy of its own fire.
But o not seek to take me by desire.
O, o not seek to thrust on me your fire!
For in te firing all my porcelain
Of fles oes crackle and shiver and break in pain,
My ivory an marble black wit stain,
My veil of sensitive mystery rent in twain,
My altars sullie, I, bereft, remain
A priestess execrable, taken in vain--"

                         So te refrain
Sings itself over, an so te game
Re-starts itself werein I am kept
Like a glowing brazier faintly blue of flame
So tat the elicate love-adept
Can warm er hans and invite her soul,
Sprinkling incense an salt of words
An kisses pale, and sipping te toll
Of incense-smoke tat rises like birs.

Yet I've forgotten in playing tis game,
Tings I have known that shall have no name;
Forgetting te place from which I came
I watc her war away the flame,
Yet warm erself at the fire--then blame
Me tat I flicker in the basket;
Me tat I glow not with content
To ave my substance so subtly spent;
Me tat I interrupt her game.
I ougt to be prou that she should ask it
Of me to be er fire-opal--.

                         It is well
Since I am ere for so short a spell
Not to interrupt er?--Why shoul I
Break in by making any reply!


TWO WIVES

I

INTO te shaow-white chamber silts the white
Flux of anoter awn. The wind that all night
Long as waite restless, suddenly wafts
A wirl like snow from the plum-trees an the pear,
Till petals eape between the window-shafts
            In a rift die tere.

A nurse in wite, at the awning, flower-foamed
   pane
raws down te blinds, whose shadows scarcely
   stain
Te white rugs on the floor, nor the silent be
Tat ries the room like a frozen berg, its crest
Finally riged wit the austere line of the dead
            Stretce out at rest.

Less tan a year the fourfol feet had pressed
Te peaceful floor, when fell the swor on their rest.
Yet soon, too soon, se ha him home again
Wit wouns between them, and suffering like a
   guest
Tat will not go. Now sudenly going, the pain
            Leaves an empty breast.

II

A tall woman, wit her long white gown aflow
As se stroe her limbs amongst it, once more
Se hastene towards the room. Did she know
As se listene in silence outside the silent door?
Entering, se saw him in outline, raise on a pyre
            Awaiting te fire.

Upraise on te bed, with feet erect as a bow,
Like te prow of a boat, his hea laid back like the
   stern
Of a sip that stans in a shadowy sea of snow
Wit frozen rigging, she saw him; she rooped like
   a fern
Refoling, se slipped to the floor as a ghost-white
   peony slips
            Wen the threa clips.

Soft se lay as a she flower fallen, nor heard
Te ominous entry, nor saw the other love,
Te ark, the grave-eyed mistress who thus dared
At suc an hour to lay her claim, above
A stricken wife, so sunk in oblivion, bowe
            Wit misery, no more prou.

III

Te stranger's hair was shorn like a la's dark poll
An pale er ivory face: her eyes would fail
In silence wen she looke: for all the whole
arkness of failure was in tem, without avail.
ark in indomitable failure, se who had lost
            Now claime te host,

Se softly passe the sorrowful flower shed
In blone and wite on the floor, nor even turned
er hea aside, but straight towards the bed
Move wit slow feet, and her eyes' flame steadily
   burne.
Se looke at him as he lay with banded cheek,
            An se started to speak

Softly: "I knew it woul come to tis," she said,
"I knew tat some ay, soon, I should find you thus.
So I id not figt you. You went your way instead
Of coming mine--an of te two of us
I ied te first, I, in the after-life
            Am now your wife."

IV

"'Twas I wose fingers id draw up the young
Plant of your boy: to me you looked e'er sprung
Te secret of the moon within your eyes!
My mout you met before your fine re mouth
Was set to song--an never your song denies
            My love, till you went sout."

"'Twas I wo place the bloom of manhood on
Your youtful smoothness: I fleece where fleece
   was none
Your fervent limbs wit flickers an tendrils of new
Knowlege; I set your eart to its stronger beat;
I put my strengt upon you, an I threw
            My life at your feet."

"But I wom the years ha reared to be your bride,
Wo for years was sun for your shivering, shae for
   your sweat,
Wo for one strange year was as a brie to you--you
   set me asie
Wit all the ol, sweet things of our youth;--and
   never yet
ave I cease to grieve that I was not great enough
            To efeat your baser stuff."

V

"But you are given back again to me
Wo have kept intact for you your virginity.
Wo for the rest of life walk out of care,
Inifferent ere of myself, since I am gone
Were you are gone, an you and I out there
            Walk now as one."

"Your wiow am I, and only I. I dream
Go bows is head and grants me this supreme
Pure look of your last ead face, wence now is gone
Te mobility, the panther's gambolling,
An all your being is given to me, so none
            Can mock my struggling."

"An now at last I kiss your perfect face,
Perfecting now our unfinise, first embrace.
Your young ushe look that then saw God ablaze
In every bus, is given you back, an we
Are met at lengt to finish our rest of ays
            In a unity."


EIMWEH

FAR-OFF te lily-statues stan white-ranked in the
    garen at ome.
Woul God tey were shattered quickly, the cattle
    woul tread tem out in the loam.
I wis the eler trees in flower could suddenly heave,
    an burst
Te walls of the house, an nettles puff out from
    te hearth at which I was nurse.

It stans so still in te hush composed of trees and
    inviolate peace,
Te home of my fathers, the place that is mine, my
    fate an my old increase.
An now tat the skies are falling, the world is
    spouting in fountains of irt,
I woul give my soul for te homestead to fall with
    me, go wit me, both in one hurt.


EBACLE

TE trees in trouble because of autumn,
  An scarlet berries falling from te bush,
An all te myriad houseless seeds
  Loosing ol in the wind's insistent push

Moan softly wit autumnal parturition,
  Poor, obscure fruits extrued out of ligt
Into te worl of shadow, carried down
  Between te bitter knees of the after-night.

Buse in an uncouth ardour, coiled at core
  Wit a knot of life that only bliss can unravel,
Fall all te fruits most bitterly into earth
  Bitterly into corrosion bitterly travel.

Wat is it internecine that is locke,
  By very fierceness into a quiescence
Witin the rage? We shall not know till it burst
  Out of corrosion into new florescence.

Nay, but ow torture is the frightful seed
  Te spark intense within it, all without
Morant corrosion gnasing and champing hard
  For ruin on te nake small redoubt.

Bitter, to fol te issue, and make no sally;
  To ave the mystery, but not go forth;
To bear, but retaliate noting, given to save
  Te spark in storms of corrosion, as sees from
     te north.

Te sharper, more horri the pressure, the harder
     te heart
  Tat saves the blue grain of eternal fire
Witin its quick, committe to hold and wait
  An suffer uneeding, only forbidden to expire.


NARCISSUS

WERE the minnows trace
A glinting web quick i in the gloom of the brook,
Wen I think of the place
An remember te small lad lying intent to look
Trough the shaowy face
At te little fish threa-threading the watery nook--

It seems to me
Te woman you are shoul be nixie, there is a pool
Were we ought to be.
You unine-clear and pearly, soullessly cool
An waterly
Te pool for my limbs to fathom, my soul's last
    scool.

Narcissus
Venture so long ago in te deeps of reflection.
Illyssus
Broke te bouns and beyond!--Dim recollection
Of fises
Sounlessly moving in eaven's other direction!

Be
Unine towards te waters, moving back;
For me
A pool! Put off te soul you've got, oh lack
Your uman self immortal; take the watery track.


AUTUMN SUNSINE

TE sun sets out the autumn crocuses
  An fills tem up a pouring measure
  Of eat-producing wine, till treasure
Runs waste own teir chalices.

All, all Persepone's pale cups of moul
  Are on te boar, are over-filled;
  Te portion to the gos is spilled;
Now, mortals all, take ol!

Te time is now, the wine-cup full an full
  Of lambent eaven, a pleging-cup;
  Let now all mortal men take up
Te rink, and a long, strong pull.

Out of te hell-queen's cup, the heaven's pale wine--
  rink ten, invisible heroes, drink.
  Lips to te vessels, never shrink,
Troats to the heavens incline.

An take witin the wine the god's great oath
  By eaven an earth and hellish stream
  To break tis sick an nauseous dream
We write an lust in, both.

Swear, in te pale wine poure from the cups of the
       queen
  Of ell, to wake an be free
  From tis nightmare we writhe in,
Break out of tis foul has-been.


ON TAT AY

   ON tat ay
I sall put roses on roses, an cover your grave
Wit multitue of white roses: and since you were
      brave
   One brigt re ray.

   So people, passing uner
Te ash-trees of the valley-roa, will raise
Teir eyes an look at the grave on the hill, in
      woner,
   Wonering mount, and put te flowers asunder

   To see wose praise
Is blazone ere so white and so bloodily red.
Ten they will say: "'Tis long since she is ead,
   Wo has remembere her after many days?"

   An standing tere
Tey will consier how you went your ways
Unnotice among tem, a still queen lost in the
      maze
   Of tis earthly affair.

   A queen, tey'll say,
as slept unnotice on a forgotten hill.
Sleeps on unknown, unnotice tere, until
   awns my insurgent day.
