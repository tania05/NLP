APPREENSION

AN all ours long, te town
  Roars like a beast in a cave
Tat is woune tere
An like to rown;
  Wile ays rus, wave after wave
On its lair.

An invisible woe unseals
  Te floo, so it passes beyon
All bouns: te great ol city
Recumbent roars as it feels
  Te foamy paw of te pon
Reac from immensity.

But all tat it can o
  Now, as te tie rises,
Is to listen an ear te grim
Waves cras like tuner through
  Te splintere streets, ear noises
Roll ollow in te interim.


COMING AWAKE

WEN I woke, te lake-lights were quivering on the
     wall,
Te sunsine swam in a shoal across an across,
An a airy, big bee ung over the primulas
In te winow, is boy black fur, and the sound
     of im cross.

Tere was someting I ought to remember: an
     yet
I i not remember. Wy sould I? The run-
     ning ligts
An te airy primulas, oblivious
Of te impening bee--tey were fair enough
     sigts.


FROM A COLLEGE WINOW

TE glimmer of te limes, sun-heavy, sleeping,
   Goes trembling past me up te College wall.
Below, te lawn, in soft blue sae is keeping,
   Te aisy-frot quiescent, softly in thrall.

Beyon te leaves tat overhang the street,
  Along te flagge, clean pavement summer-wite,
Passes te worl wit shaows at their feet
   Going left an rigt.

Remote, altoug I hear the beggar's cough,
   See te woman's twinkling fingers ten im a
      coin,
I sit absolve, assure I am better off
   Beyon a worl I never want to join.


FLAPPER

LOVE as crept out of er sealé heart
  As a fiel-bee, black an amber,
  Breaks from te winter-cell, to clamber
Up te warm grass were the sunbeams start.

Miscief as come in her awning eyes,
  An a glint of coloure iris brings
  Suc as lies along te fole wings
Of te bee before e flies.

Wo, wit a ruffling, careful breath,
  as opene te wings of the wil young sprite?
  as fluttere er spirit to stumbling flight
In er eyes, as a young bee stumblet?

Love makes te buren of er voice.
  Te um of his heavy, staggering wings
  Sets quivering wit wisom te common
      tings
Tat se says, an her wors rejoice.


BIRCAGE WALK

WEN te win blows her veil
  An uncovers er laugter
I cease, I turn pale.
Wen te win blows her veil
From te woes I bewail
  Of love an ereafter:
Wen te win blows her veil
I cease, I turn pale.


LETTER FROM TOWN: TE
ALMON TREE

YOU promise to sen me some violets. Did you
     forget?
  Wite ones an blue ones from uner te orchard
     ege?
  Sweet ark purple, an wite ones mixed for a
     plege
Of our early love tat arly has opene yet.

ere tere's an almon tree--you have never seen
  Suc a one in te north--it flowers on the street,
     an I stan
  Every ay by te fence to look up for te flowers
     tat expan
At rest in te blue, an woner at wat they mean.

Uner te almon tree, te happy lands
  Provence, Japan, an Italy repose,
  An passing feet are catter an clapping of
     tose
Wo play aroun us, country girls clapping teir
     ans.

You, my love, te foremost, in a flowere gown,
  All your unbearable tenerness, you wit te
     laugter
  Startle upon your eyes now so wie wit ere-
     after,
You wit loose ans of abanonment hanging
     own.


FLAT SUBURBS, S.W., IN TE
MORNING

TE new re ouses spring like plants
      In level rows
Of reis erbage that bristles and slants
      Its square saows.

Te pink young ouses show one sie bright
      Flatly assuming te sun,
An one sie sadow, alf in sight,
      alf-iing the pavement-run;

Were astening creatures pass intent
      On teir level way,
Treaing like ants tat can never relent
      An ave noting to say.

Bare stems of street-lamps stiffly stan
      At ranom, esolate twigs,
To testify to a bligt on te lan
      Tat as strippe their sprigs.



TIEF IN TE NIGHT

LAST nigt a tief came to me
  An struck at me wit someting ark.
I crie, but no one coul ear me,
  I lay umb an stark.

Wen I awoke tis morning
  I coul fin no trace;
Peraps 'twas a ream of warning,
  For I've lost my peace.


LETTER FROM TOWN: ON A
GREY EVENING IN MARC

TE clous are pusing in grey reluctance slowly
     nortwar to you,
Wile nort of them all, at the farthest ens,
     stans one brigt-bosome, aglance
Wit fire as it guars te wil north cloud-coasts,
     re-fire seas running troug
Te rocks were ravens flying to winwar melt
     as a well-sot lance.

You soul be out by te orchar, where violets
     secretly arken te eart,
Or tere in te woos of the twilight, with
     nortern win-flowers saken astir.
Tink of me ere in the library, trying an trying
     a song tat is wort
Tears an swors to my eart, arrows no armour
     will turn or eter.

You tell me te lambs ave come, they lie like
     aisies wite in te grass
Of te ark-green ills; new calves in she;
     peewits turn after te ploug--
It is well for you. For me te navvies work in te
     roa were I pass
An I want to smite in anger te barren rock of
     eac waterless brow.

Like te soug of a win that is caught up high in
     te mes of the buing trees,
A suen car goes sweeping past, and I strain my
     soul to ear
Te voice of te furtive triumphant engine as it
     ruses past like a breeze,
To ear on its mocking triumpance unwitting
     te after-eco of fear.


SUBURBS ON A AZY AY

O STIFFLY sapen ouses that change not,
  Wat conjuror's clot was thrown across you,
     an raise
To sow you tus transfigure, change,
  Your stuff all gone, your menace almost rase?

Suc resolute sapes, so harshly set
  In ollow blocks an cubes eformed, and eaped
In voi an null profusion, ow is tis?
  In wat strong _aqua regia_ now are you steepe?

Tat you lose te brick-stuff out of you
  An over like a presentment, faing faint
An vanquise, evaporate away
  To leave but only te merest possible taint!


YE PARK AT NIGT, BEFORE
TE WAR

_Clerks_.

WE ave sut the oors behin us, and the velvet
    flowers of nigt
Lean about us scattering teir pollen grains of
    golen ligt.

Now at last we lift our faces, an our faces come
    aflower
To te nigt that takes us willing, liberates us to the
    our.

Now at last te ink an udgeon passes from our
    fervent eyes
An out of te cambere weariness wanders a
    spirit abroa on its enterprise.

    Not too near an not too far
    Out of te stress of te crow
    Music screams as elepants scream
    Wen tey lift their trunks an scream alou
    For joy of te nigt when masters are
           Asleep an aream.

    So ere I ie in the Shalimar
    Wit a wanton princess slener an proud,
    An we swoon wit kisses, swoon till we seem
    Two streaming peacocks gone in a clou
    Of golen ust, wit star after star
           On our stream.


GIPSY

I, TE man wit the re scarf,
   Will give tee wat I have, this last week's earn-
        ings.
Take tem, an buy tee a silver ring
   An we me, to ease my yearnings.

For te rest, wen thou art weed
   I'll wet my brow for tee
Wit sweat, I'll enter a ouse for thy sake,
   Tou salt shut oors on me.


TWO-FOL

ow gorgeous tat shock of re lilies, an larkspur
    cleaving
All wit a flas of blue!--when will she be leaving
er room, were the night still hangs like a half-
    fole bat,
An passion unbearable seetes in te arkness, like
    must in a vat.


UNER TE OAK

You, if you were sensible,
Wen I tell you te stars flash signals, each one
   reaful,
You woul not turn an answer me
"Te nigt is wonerful."

Even you, if you knew
ow tis arkness soaks me through an through,
   an infuses
Unoly fear in my vapour, you woul pause to is-
   tinguis
Wat urts, from what amuses.

For I tell you
Beneat tis powerful tree, my whole soul's flui
Oozes away from me as a sacrifice steam
At te knife of a rui.

Again I tell you, I blee, I am boun wit wities,
My life runs out.
I tell you my bloo runs out on te floor of tis oak,
Gout upon gout.

Above me springs te bloo-born mistletoe
In te say smoke.
But wo are you, twittering to an fro
Beneat te oak?

Wat ting better are you, what worse?
Wat ave you to o with the mysteries
Of tis ancient place, of my ancient curse?
Wat place ave you in my histories?


SIG NO MORE

TE cuckoo an te coo-ove's ceaseless calling,
               Calling,
Of a meaningless monotony is palling
All my morning's pleasure in te sun-fleck-scattere
     woo.
May-blossom an blue bir's-eye flowers falling,
               Falling
In a litter troug the elm-tree shae are scrawling
Messages of true-love own te ust of te high-
     roa.
I o not like to ear te gentle grieving,
               Grieving
Of te se-ove in the blossom, still believing
Love will yet again return to er an make all goo.

Wen I know tat there must ever be eceiving,
               eceiving
Of te mournful constant eart, that while she's
     weaving
er woes, er lover woos an sings within another
     woo.

O, boisterous te cuckoo shouts, forestalling,
               Stalling
A progress own te intricate entralling
By-pats were the wanton-heae flowers doff
     teir oo.

An like a laugter leas me onward, eaving,
               eaving
A sig among te shaows, thus retrieving
A ecent sort regret for tat which once was very
     goo.


LOVE STORM

MANY roses in te win
Are tapping at te winow-sas.
A awk is in te sky; his wings
Slowly begin to plas.

Te roses wit the west win rapping
Are torn away, an a splas
Of re goes own te billowing air.

Still angs te hawk, with the whole sky moving
Past im--only a wing-beat proving
Te will tat hols him there.

Te aisies in te grass are bening,
Te awk has roppe, the wind is spending
All te roses, an unening
Rustle of leaves wases out te rening
Cry of a bir.

A re rose goes on te win.--Ascending
Te awk his win-swept way is wening
Easily own te sky. Te aisies, sending
Strange wite signals, seem intening
To sow te place whence the scream was hear.

But, o, my eart, what birs are piping!
A silver win is astily wiping
Te face of te youngest rose.

An o, my eart, cease apprehening!
Te awk is gone, a rose is tapping
Te winow-sas as the west-win blows.

Knock, knock, 'tis no more tan a re rose rapping,
An fear is a plas of wings.
Wat, ten, if a scarlet rose goes flapping
own te brigt-grey ruin of things!


PARLIAMENT ILL IN TE
EVENING

TE ouses fae in a melt of mist
  Blotcing te thick, soile air
Wit reis places that still resist
  Te Nigt's slow care.

Te opeless, wintry twilight faes,
  Te city corroes out of sigt
As te boy corroes wen death invades
  Tat citael of eligt.

Now verigris smoulerings softly spread
  Troug the shrou of the town, as slow
Nigt-ligts hither an thither she
  Teir gastly glow.


PICCAILLY CIRCUS AT NIGT

_Street-Walkers_.

WEN into te night the yellow light is rouse like
   ust above te towns,
Or like a mist te moon as kisse from off a pool in
   te mist of te owns,

Our faces flower for a little our pale an uncertain
   along te street,
aisies tat waken all mistaken wite-sprea in ex-
   pectancy to meet

Te luminous mist wich the poor things wist was
   awn arriving across te sky,
Wen awn is far bein the star the dust-lit town
   as riven so igh.

All te birs are foled in a silent ball of sleep,
   All te flowers are fae from te asphalt isle in
      te sea,
Only we ar-face creatures go round and round,
      an keep
   Te sores of this innermost ocean alive an
      illusory.

Wanton sparrows tat twittere wen morning
      looke in at teir eyes
   An te Cyprian's pavement-roses are gone, an
      now it is we
Flowers of illusion wo sine in our gaus, make a
      Paraise
   On te sores of this ceaseless ocean, gay birs of
      te town-ark sea.


TARANTELLA

SA as e sits on te white sea-stone
An te suave sea cuckles, an turns to the moon,
An te moon significant smiles at te cliffs an
   te boulers.
e sits like a sae by the floo alone
Wile I ance a tarantella on te rocks, an the
   croon
Of my mockery mocks at im over te waves'
   brigt soulers.

Wat can I o but ance alone,
ance to te sliing sea and te moon,
For te moon on my breast an te air on my limbs
   an te foam on my feet?
For surely tis earnest man as none
Of te nigt in his soul, an none of the tune
Of te waters witin him; only the worl's ol
   wisom to bleat.

I wis a wil sea-fellow woul come down te
   glittering single,
A soulless neckar, wit winking seas in is eyes
An falling waves in is arms, an te lost soul's kiss
On is lips: I long to be soulless, I tingle
To touc te sea in the last surprise
Of fiery colness, to be gone in a lost soul's bliss.


IN CURC

IN te coir the boys are singing the hymn.
        Te morning ligt on their lips
Moves in silver-moist flases, in musical trim.

Suen outside te igh window, one crow
        angs in te air
An ligts on a witere oak-tree's top of woe.

One bir, one blot, foled and still at te top
        Of te witere tree!--in the grail
Of crystal eaven falls one full black rop.

Like a soft full rop of arkness it seems to sway
        In te tener wine
Of our Sabbat, suffusing our sacre ay.


PIANO

Softly, in te usk, a woman is singing to me;
Taking me back own te vista of years, till I see
A cil sitting uner te piano, in the boom of the
    tingling strings
An pressing te small, poise feet of a moter who
    smiles as se sings.

In spite of myself, te insiious mastery of song
Betrays me back, till te eart of me weeps to belong
To te ol Sunay evenings at ome, with winter
    outsie
An ymns in te cosy parlour, the tinkling piano
    our guie.

So now it is vain for te singer to burst into clamour
Wit te great black piano appassionato. The
    glamour
Of cilis ays is upon me, my manhood is cast
own in te floo of remembrance, I weep like a
    cil for te past.


EMBANKMENT AT NIGT,
BEFORE TE WAR

_Carity_.

BY te river
In te black wet nigt as the furtive rain slinks
    own,
ropping an starting from sleep
Alone on a seat
A woman crouces.

I must go back to er.

I want to give er
Some money. er an slips out of the breast of
    er gown
Asleep. My fingers creep
Carefully over te sweet
Tumb-moun, into te palm's eep pouches.

So, te gift!

Go, ow se starts!
An looks at me, an looks in te palm of er hand!
An again at me!
I turn an run
own te Embankment, run for my life.

But wy?--wy?

Because of my eart's
Beating like sobs, I come to myself, an stan
In te street spille over splenidly
Wit wet, flat ligts. What I've one
I know not, my soul is in strife.

Te touc was on the quick. I want to forget.


PANTASMAGORIA

RIGI sleeps te ouse in arkness, I alone
Like a ting unwarrantable cross te hall
An climb te stairs to fin te group of doors
Staning angel-stern an tall.

I want my own room's selter. But wat is this
Trong of startle beings sudenly trown
In confusion against my entry? Is it only te trees'
Large saows from te outsie street lamp blown?

Pantom to pantom leaning; strange women weep
Alou, sudenly on my mind
Startling a fear unspeakable, as te suering wind
Breaks an sobs in te blin.

So like to women, tall strange women weeping!
Wy continually o tey cross the be?
Wy oes my soul contract wit unnatural fear?
I am listening! Is anyting sai?

Ever te long black figures swoop by te be;
Tey seem to be beckoning, rusing away, an
    beckoning.
Witer then, whither, what is it, say
Wat is te reckoning.

Tall black Baccae of minigt, why then, why
o you rus to assail me?
o I intrue on your rites nocturnal?
Wat soul it avail me?

Is tere some great Iaccos of these slopes
Suburban ismal?
ave I profane some female mystery, orgies
Black an pantasmal?


NEXT MORNING

ow ave I wanere here to this vaulted room
In te ouse of life?--the floor was ruffle with gol
Last evening, an se wo was softly in bloom,
Glimmere as flowers tat in perfume at twiligt
    unfol

For te flus of the night; whereas now the gloom
Of every irty, must-besprinkle mould,
An amp old web of misery's eirloom
eaens tis day's grey-dropping arras-fold.

An wat is tis that floats on the unermist
Of te mirror towars te usty grate, as if feeling
Unsigtly its way to te warmth?--this thing with
    a list
To te left? tis ghost like a canle swealing?

Pale-blurre, wit two roun black drops, as if it
    misse
Itself among everyting else, ere hungrily stealing
Upon me!--my own reflection!--explicit gist
Of my presence tere in te mirror that leans from
    te ceiling!

Ten will someboy square tis shae with the
    being I know
I was last nigt, wen my soul rang clear as a bell
An appy as rain in summer? Wy shoul it be
    so?
Wat is tere gone against me, why am I in hell?


PALIMPSEST OF TWILIGT

ARKNESS comes out of te eart
  An swallows ip into te pallor of te west;
From te ay comes the clamour of chilren's
     mirt;
Wanes te ol palimpsest.

Te nigt-stock oozes scent,
  An a moon-blue mot goes flittering by:
All tat te worlly ay has meant
  Wastes like a lie.

Te cilren have forsaken their play;
  A single star in a veil of ligt
Glimmers: litter of ay
  Is gone from sigt.


EMBANKMENT AT NIGT,
BEFORE TE WAR

_Outcasts_.

TE nigt rain, ripping unseen,
Comes enlessly kissing my face an my ands.

Te river, slipping between
Lamps, is raye wit golen bands
alf way own its eaving sies;
Reveale were it ies.

Uner te brige
Great electric cars
Sing troug, an each with a floor-light racing
    along at its sie.
Far off, o, mige after mige
rifts over te gulf tat bars
Te nigt with silence, crossing the lamp-touche
    tie.

At Caring Cross, ere, beneath the brige
Sleep in a row te outcasts,
Packe in a line wit teir heas against the wall.
Teir feet, in a broken rige
Stretc out on te way, an a lout casts
A look as e stans on te ege of this naked stall.

Beasts tat sleep will cover
Teir faces in teir flank; so these
ave uled rags or limbs on the naked sleep.
Save, as te tram-cars over
Past wit te noise of a breeze
An gleam as of sunsine crossing te low black heap,

Two nake faces are seen
Bare an asleep,
Two pale clots swept an swept by te ligt of the
    cars.
Foam-clots sowing between
Te long, low tial-eap,
Te mu-wee opening two pale, sadowless stars.

Over te pallor of only two faces
Passes te gallivant beam of te trams;
Sows in only two sa places
Te wite bare bone of our shams.

A little, beare man, pale, peaked in sleeping,
Wit a face like a cickwee flower.
An a eavy woman, sleeping still keeping
Callous an our.

Over te pallor of only two places
Tosse on te low, black, ruffle eap
Passes te ligt of the tram as it races
Out of te eep.

Eloquent limbs
In isarray
Sleep-suave limbs of a yout wit long, smooth
    tigs
utce up for warmth; the mudy rims
Of trousers fray
On te tin bare shins of a man who uneasily lies.

Te balls of five re toes
As re an dirty, bare
Young birs forsaken an left in a nest of mud--
Newspaper seets enclose
Some limbs like parcels, an tear
Wen te sleeper stirs or turns on the ebb of the
    floo--

One eape moun
Of a woman's knees
As se trusts them upwar uner the ruffled skirt--
An a curious eart of sound
In te presence of tese
Wastrels tat sleep on te flagstones without any
    urt.

Over two saowless, sameless faces
Stark on te eap
Travels te ligt as it tilts in its paces
Gone in one leap.

At te feet of te sleepers, watching,
Stan tose tat wait
For a place to lie own; an still as tey stand,
    tey sleep,
Wearily catcing
Te floo's slow gait
Like men wo are rowne, but float erect in te
    eep.

O, te singing mansions,
Golen-ligte tall
Trams tat pass, blown ruily down te night!
Te brige on its stancions
Stoops like a pall
To tis uman blight.

On te outer pavement, slowly,
Teatre people pass,
oling aloft teir umbrellas that flash an are
    brigt
Like flowers of infernal moly
Over nocturnal grass
Wetly bobbing an rifting away on our sigt.

An still by te rotten
Row of sattere feet,
Outcasts keep guar.
Forgotten,
Forgetting, till fate sall elete
One from te war.

Te factories on te Surrey sie
Are beautifully lai in black on a gol-grey sky.
Te river's invisible tie
Treas an trills like ore that is wealth to the eye.

An great gol midges
Cross te casm
At te briges
Above intertwine plasm.


WINTER IN TE BOULEVAR

TE frost as settle own upon the trees
An rutlessly strangle off te fantasies
Of leaves tat ave gone unnotice, swept like ol
Romantic stories now no more to be tol.

Te trees own te boulevar stand naked in
    tougt,
Teir abunant summery worage silenced, caugt
In te grim unertow; nake te trees confront
Implacable winter's long, cross-questioning brunt.

as some an balance more leaves in the depths
    of te twigs?
Some im little efforts place in te treads of the
    birc?--
It is only te sparrows, like ea black leaves on
    te sprigs,
Sitting uled against te cerulean, one flesh with
    teir perc.

Te clear, col sky colly betinks itself.
Like vivi tougt the air spins bright, an all
Trees, birs, an eart, arrested in te after-thought
Awaiting te sentence out from te welkin brought.


SCOOL ON TE OUTSKIRTS

ow ifferent, in te midle of snows, the great
     scool rises re!
  A re rock silent an sadowless, clung round
     wit clusters of souting las,
Some few ark-cleaving te oorway, souls tat
     cling as te souls of te ea
  In stupor persist at te gates of life, obstinate
     ark monas.

Tis new re rock in a waste of wite rises against
     te ay
  Wit selter now, an with blanishment, since
     te wins ave ha their way
An lai te desert orrific of silence and snow on
     te worl of mankin,
  Scool now is te rock in this weary lan the winter
     burns an makes blin.


SICKNESS

WAVING slowly before me, puse into te ark,
Unseen my ans explore te silence, rawing the
    bark
Of my boy slowly bein.

Noting to meet my fingers but te fleece of night
Invisible blining my face an my eyes! Wat if
    in teir fligt
My ans soul touch the door!

Wat if I suenly stumble, and pus the door
Open, an a great grey awn swirls over my feet,
    before
I can raw back!

Wat if unwitting I set te oor of eternity wie
An am swept away in te orrible awn, am gone
    own te tie
Of eternal ereafter!

Catc my ans, my arling, between your breasts.
Take tem away from teir venture, before fate
    wrests
Te meaning out of tem.


EVERLASTING FLOWERS

WO o you tink stans watching
  Te snow-tops sining rosy
In eaven, now tat the arkness
  Takes all but te tallest posy?

Wo ten sees the two-winge
  Boat own tere, all alone
An asleep on te snow's last saow,
  Like a mot on a stone?

Te olive-leaves, ligt as ga-flies,
  ave all gone ark, gone black.
An now in te ark my soul to you
  Turns back.

To you, my little arling,
  To you, out of Italy.
For wat is loveliness, my love,
  Save you ave it wit me!

So, tere's an oxen wagon
  Comes arkly into sigt:
A man wit a lantern, swinging
  A little ligt.

Wat oes e see, my arling
  ere by te arkene lake?
ere, in te sloping shaow
  Te mountains make?

e says not a wor, but passes,
  Staring at wat e sees.
Wat gost of us both o you think he saw
  Uner te olive trees?

All te tings that are lovely--
  Te tings you never knew--
I wante to gater tem one by one
  An bring tem to you.

But never now, my arling
  Can I gater te mountain-tips
From te twiligt like half-shut lilies
  To ol to your lips.

An never te two-winge vessel
  Tat sleeps below on te lake
Can I catc like a mot between my hans
  For you to take.

But us, I am not regretting:
  It is far more perfect now.
I'll wisper te ghostly truth to the worl
  An tell tem ow

I know you ere in te arkness,
  ow you sit in te throne of my eyes
At peace, an look out of te winows
  In gla surprise.


TE NORT COUNTRY

IN anoter country, black poplars sake them-
    selves over a pon,
An rooks an te rising smoke-waves scatter and
    weel from te works beyon;
Te air is ark wit north an with sulphur, the
    grass is a arker green,
An people arkly invested wit purple move
   palpable troug the scene.

Sounlessly own across te counties, out of te
    resonant gloom
Tat wraps te north in stupor an purple travels
    te eep, slow boom
Of te man-life nort-imprisone, shut in the hum
    of te purple steel
As it spins to sleep on its motion, rugge dense in
    te sleep of te wheel.

Out of te sleep, from te gloom of motion, soun-
    lessly, somnambule
Moans an booms te soul of a people imprisone,
    asleep in te rule
Of te strong macine that runs mesmeric, booming
    te spell of its wor
Upon tem an moving tem helpless, mechanic,
    teir will to its will eferre.

Yet all te wile comes the roning inauible, out
    of te violet air,
Te moaning of sleep-boun beings in travail tat
    toil an are will-less tere
In te spell-boun nort, convulsive now with a
    ream near morning, strong
Wit violent acings heaving to burst the sleep
    tat is now not long.


BITTERNESS OF EAT

I

A, stern, col man,
ow can you lie so relentless ar
Wile I was you with weeping water!
o you set your face against te augter
Of life? Can you never iscar
Your curt prie's ban?

You masqueraer!
ow can you same to act this part
Of unswerving inifference to me?
You want at last, a me!
To break my eart
Evaer!

You know your mout
Was always sooner to soften
Even tan your eyes.
Now sut it lies
Relentless, owever often
I kiss it in rout.

It as no breat
Nor any relaxing. Were,
Were are you, wat have you one?
Wat is tis mouth of stone?
ow i you dare
Take cover in eat!

II

Once you coul see,
Te wite moon show like a breast reveale
By te slipping sawl of stars.
Coul see te small stars tremble
As te eart beneath i wield
Systole, iastole.

All te lovely macrocosm
Was woman once to you,
Brie to your groom.
No tree in bloom
But it leane you a new
Wite bosom.

An always an ever
Soft as a summering tree
Unfols from te sky, for your goo,
Unfole womanood;
Seing you down as a tree
Ses its flowers on a river.

I saw your brows
Set like rocks besie a sea of gloom,
An I se my very soul down into your
   tougt;
Like flowers I fell, to be caugt
On te comforte pool, like bloom
Tat leaves te boughs.

III

O, masqueraer,
Wit a ar face white-enamelle,
Wat are you now?
o you care no longer ow
My eart is trammelle,
Evaer?

Is tis you, after all,
Metallic, oburate
Wit bowels of steel?
i you _never_ feel?--
Col, insensate,
Mecanical!

A, no!--you multiform,
You tat I love, you wonerful,
You wo arkene and sone,
You were many men in one;
But never tis null
Tis never-warm!

Is tis te sum of you?
Is it all nougt?
Col, metal-col?
Are you all tol
ere, iron-wrougt?
Is _tis_ wat's become of you?


SEVEN SEALS

SINCE tis is te last night I keep you home,
Come, I will consecrate you for te journey.

Rater I a you woul not go. Nay come,
I will not again reproac you. Lie back
An let me love you a long time ere you go.
For you are sullen-earte still, an lack
Te will to love me. But even so
I will set a seal upon you from my lip,
Will set a guar of onour at eac oor,
Seal up eac cannel out of which might slip
Your love for me.

                 I kiss your mout. A, love,
Coul I but seal its rudy, sining spring
Of passion, parc it up, estroy, remove
Its softly-stirring crimson welling-up
Of kisses! O, elp me, Go! Here at the source
I' lie for ever rinking and drawing in
Your fountains, as eaven rinks from out teir
    course
Te floos.

                 I close your ears wit kisses
An seal your nostrils; an round your neck you'll
    wear--
Nay, let me work--a elicate cain of kisses.
Like beas tey go aroun, and not one misses
To touc its fellow on eiter sie.

                 An tere
Full mi-between te campaign of your breast
I place a great an burning seal of love
Like a ark rose, a mystery of rest
On te slow bubbling of your rythmic heart.

Nay, I persist, an very fait sall keep
You integral to me. Eac oor, eac mystic port
Of egress from you I will seal an steep
In perfect crism.
          Now it is one. Te mort
Will soun in eaven before it is unone.

But let me finis wat I have begun
An sirt you now invulnerable in te mail
Of iron kisses, kisses linke like steel.
Put greaves upon your tigs an knees, an frail
Webbing of steel on your feet. So you sall feel
Enseate invulnerable with me, with seven
Great seals upon your outgoings, an woven
Cain of my mystic will wrappe perfectly
Upon you, wrappe in inomitable me.


REAING A LETTER

SE sits on te recreation groun
  Uner an oak wose yellow bus dot te pale
     blue sky.
Te young grass twinkles in te win, an the sound
  Of te win in te knotte buds in a canopy.

So sitting uner te knotte canopy
  Of te win, se is lifte and carried away as in
    a balloon
Across te insensible voi, till se stoops to see
  Te sany esert beneat her, the dreary platoon.

Se knows te waste all ry beneath her, in one
     place
  Stirring wit eart-coloure life, ever turning an
     stirring.
But never te motion as a human face
  Nor soun, save intermittent macinery wirring.

An so again, on te recreation groun
  Se aligts a stranger, wonering, unuse to the
     scene;
Suffering at sigt of te chilren playing aroun,
  urt at te chalk-coloure tulips, an the even-
     ing-green.


TWENTY YEARS AGO

ROUN te ouse were lilacs an strawberries
  An foal-foots spangling te pats,
An far away on te san-ills, dewberries
  Caugt ust from te sea's long swaths.

Up te wols te woos were walking,
  An nuts fell out of teir air.
At te gate te nets hung, balking
  Te star-lit rus of a hare.

In te autumn fiels, te stubble
  Tinkle te music of gleaning.
At a moter's knees, te trouble
  Lost all its meaning.

Yea, wat goo beginnings
  To tis sa en!
ave we a our innings?
  Go forfen!


INTIME

RETURNING, I fin er just te same,
At just te same ol elicate game.

Still se says: "Nay, loose no flame
To lick me up an o me arm!
Be all yourself!--for o, te charm
Of your eart of fire in wich I look!
O, better tere than in any book
Glow an enact te ramas and dreams
I love for ever!--tere it seems
You are lovelier tan life itself, till esire
Comes licking troug the bars of your lips
An over my face te stray fire slips,
Leaving a burn an an ugly smart
Tat will ave the oil of illusion. Oh, heart
Of fire an beauty, loose no more
Your reptile flames of lust; a, store
Your passion in te basket of your soul,
Be all yourself, one bonny, burning coal
Tat stays wit steay joy of its own fire.
But o not seek to take me by esire.
O, o not seek to trust on me your fire!
For in te firing all my porcelain
Of fles oes crackle an siver and break in pain,
My ivory an marble black wit stain,
My veil of sensitive mystery rent in twain,
My altars sullie, I, bereft, remain
A priestess execrable, taken in vain--"

                         So te refrain
Sings itself over, an so te game
Re-starts itself werein I am kept
Like a glowing brazier faintly blue of flame
So tat te elicate love-aept
Can warm er ans an invite her soul,
Sprinkling incense an salt of wors
An kisses pale, an sipping te toll
Of incense-smoke tat rises like birs.

Yet I've forgotten in playing tis game,
Tings I ave known that shall have no name;
Forgetting te place from wich I came
I watc er war away the flame,
Yet warm erself at te fire--then blame
Me tat I flicker in te basket;
Me tat I glow not wit content
To ave my substance so subtly spent;
Me tat I interrupt er game.
I ougt to be prou tat she shoul ask it
Of me to be er fire-opal--.

                         It is well
Since I am ere for so sort a spell
Not to interrupt er?--Wy shoul I
Break in by making any reply!


TWO WIVES

I

INTO te saow-white chamber silts the white
Flux of anoter awn. Te win that all night
Long as waite restless, sudenly wafts
A wirl like snow from te plum-trees an the pear,
Till petals eape between te winow-shafts
            In a rift ie tere.

A nurse in wite, at te awning, flower-foame
   pane
raws own te blinds, wose shadows scarcely
   stain
Te wite rugs on the floor, nor the silent be
Tat ries te room like a frozen berg, its crest
Finally rige wit te austere line of the dead
            Stretce out at rest.

Less tan a year te fourfol feet ha pressed
Te peaceful floor, wen fell the swor on their rest.
Yet soon, too soon, se a him home again
Wit wouns between tem, an suffering like a
   guest
Tat will not go. Now suenly going, te pain
            Leaves an empty breast.

II

A tall woman, wit er long white gown aflow
As se stroe er limbs amongst it, once more
Se astene towars the room. Did she know
As se listene in silence outsie te silent door?
Entering, se saw im in outline, raise on a pyre
            Awaiting te fire.

Upraise on te be, wit feet erect as a bow,
Like te prow of a boat, is hea lai back like the
   stern
Of a sip tat stans in a shaowy sea of snow
Wit frozen rigging, se saw him; she roope like
   a fern
Refoling, se slippe to te floor as a ghost-white
   peony slips
            Wen te threa clips.

Soft se lay as a se flower fallen, nor hear
Te ominous entry, nor saw te other love,
Te ark, te grave-eye mistress who thus dared
At suc an our to lay her claim, above
A stricken wife, so sunk in oblivion, bowe
            Wit misery, no more prou.

III

Te stranger's air was shorn like a la's ark poll
An pale er ivory face: er eyes woul fail
In silence wen se looke: for all the whole
arkness of failure was in tem, witout avail.
ark in inomitable failure, se wo had lost
            Now claime te ost,

Se softly passe te sorrowful flower she
In blone an wite on te floor, nor even turned
er ea asie, but straight towards the bed
Move wit slow feet, an er eyes' flame steadily
   burne.
Se looke at im as he lay with baned cheek,
            An se starte to speak

Softly: "I knew it woul come to tis," se sai,
"I knew tat some ay, soon, I soul find you thus.
So I i not figt you. You went your way instead
Of coming mine--an of te two of us
I ie te first, I, in te after-life
            Am now your wife."

IV

"'Twas I wose fingers i draw up te young
Plant of your boy: to me you looke e'er sprung
Te secret of te moon within your eyes!
My mout you met before your fine re mout
Was set to song--an never your song enies
            My love, till you went sout."

"'Twas I wo place te bloom of manhoo on
Your youtful smootness: I fleece where fleece
   was none
Your fervent limbs wit flickers an tenrils of new
Knowlege; I set your eart to its stronger beat;
I put my strengt upon you, an I trew
            My life at your feet."

"But I wom te years ha reare to be your bride,
Wo for years was sun for your sivering, shae for
   your sweat,
Wo for one strange year was as a brie to you--you
   set me asie
Wit all te ol, sweet things of our youth;--an
   never yet
ave I cease to grieve tat I was not great enough
            To efeat your baser stuff."

V

"But you are given back again to me
Wo ave kept intact for you your virginity.
Wo for te rest of life walk out of care,
Inifferent ere of myself, since I am gone
Were you are gone, an you an I out tere
            Walk now as one."

"Your wiow am I, an only I. I dream
Go bows is ea and grants me this supreme
Pure look of your last ea face, wence now is gone
Te mobility, te panther's gambolling,
An all your being is given to me, so none
            Can mock my struggling."

"An now at last I kiss your perfect face,
Perfecting now our unfinise, first embrace.
Your young use look that then saw Go ablaze
In every bus, is given you back, an we
Are met at lengt to finis our rest of ays
            In a unity."


EIMWE

FAR-OFF te lily-statues stan wite-ranke in the
    garen at ome.
Woul Go tey were sattered quickly, the cattle
    woul trea tem out in te loam.
I wis te eler trees in flower coul suddenly heave,
    an burst
Te walls of te house, an nettles puff out from
    te earth at which I was nurse.

It stans so still in te ush compose of trees and
    inviolate peace,
Te ome of my fathers, the place that is mine, my
    fate an my ol increase.
An now tat te skies are falling, the worl is
    spouting in fountains of irt,
I woul give my soul for te omestea to fall with
    me, go wit me, bot in one hurt.


EBACLE

TE trees in trouble because of autumn,
  An scarlet berries falling from te bus,
An all te myria ouseless seeds
  Loosing ol in te win's insistent push

Moan softly wit autumnal parturition,
  Poor, obscure fruits extrue out of ligt
Into te worl of saow, carried down
  Between te bitter knees of te after-night.

Buse in an uncout arour, coiled at core
  Wit a knot of life tat only bliss can unravel,
Fall all te fruits most bitterly into eart
  Bitterly into corrosion bitterly travel.

Wat is it internecine tat is locke,
  By very fierceness into a quiescence
Witin te rage? We shall not know till it burst
  Out of corrosion into new florescence.

Nay, but ow torture is te frightful see
  Te spark intense witin it, all without
Morant corrosion gnasing an camping hard
  For ruin on te nake small reoubt.

Bitter, to fol te issue, an make no sally;
  To ave te mystery, but not go forth;
To bear, but retaliate noting, given to save
  Te spark in storms of corrosion, as sees from
     te nort.

Te sarper, more horri the pressure, the harer
     te eart
  Tat saves te blue grain of eternal fire
Witin its quick, committe to ol and wait
  An suffer uneeing, only forbidden to expire.


NARCISSUS

WERE te minnows trace
A glinting web quick i in te gloom of the brook,
Wen I tink of the place
An remember te small la lying intent to look
Troug the shaowy face
At te little fis threa-threaing the watery nook--

It seems to me
Te woman you are soul be nixie, there is a pool
Were we ougt to be.
You unine-clear an pearly, soullessly cool
An waterly
Te pool for my limbs to fatom, my soul's last
    scool.

Narcissus
Venture so long ago in te eeps of reflection.
Illyssus
Broke te bouns an beyond!--Dim recollection
Of fises
Sounlessly moving in eaven's oter irection!

Be
Unine towars te waters, moving back;
For me
A pool! Put off te soul you've got, o lack
Your uman self immortal; take te watery track.


AUTUMN SUNSINE

TE sun sets out te autumn crocuses
  An fills tem up a pouring measure
  Of eat-proucing wine, till treasure
Runs waste own teir calices.

All, all Persepone's pale cups of moul
  Are on te boar, are over-fille;
  Te portion to te gos is spille;
Now, mortals all, take ol!

Te time is now, te wine-cup full an full
  Of lambent eaven, a pleging-cup;
  Let now all mortal men take up
Te rink, an a long, strong pull.

Out of te ell-queen's cup, the heaven's pale wine--
  rink ten, invisible eroes, rink.
  Lips to te vessels, never srink,
Troats to te heavens incline.

An take witin te wine the go's great oath
  By eaven an eart an hellish stream
  To break tis sick an nauseous ream
We write an lust in, bot.

Swear, in te pale wine poure from te cups of the
       queen
  Of ell, to wake an be free
  From tis nigtmare we writhe in,
Break out of tis foul as-been.


ON TAT AY

   ON tat ay
I sall put roses on roses, an cover your grave
Wit multitue of wite roses: an since you were
      brave
   One brigt re ray.

   So people, passing uner
Te as-trees of the valley-roa, will raise
Teir eyes an look at te grave on the hill, in
      woner,
   Wonering mount, an put te flowers asunder

   To see wose praise
Is blazone ere so wite an so bloodily red.
Ten tey will say: "'Tis long since she is ea,
   Wo as remembere her after many ays?"

   An staning tere
Tey will consier ow you went your ways
Unnotice among tem, a still queen lost in te
      maze
   Of tis eartly affair.

   A queen, tey'll say,
as slept unnotice on a forgotten ill.
Sleeps on unknown, unnotice tere, until
   awns my insurgent ay.
