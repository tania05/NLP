This book is a ost enjoyable ead.  We can, howeve, detect that
 had been eading up vaious works by W.H.G. Kingston and by
G. anville Fenn.  It's just the knowledge of foest life in Java and
Suata that akes us think that.  But that knowledge is good, fo it
akes those pats of the book that take place in these foests ring all
the oe tue.

As so often with Victoian authos writing for teenagers there is a
delightful coloued auxiliay hero.  But there is another even ore
ipotant auxiliay hero, van der Kep, and it is this man and his
doings that fo the eal interest of this story.  He had ade himself a
hoe in an island of the Kakatoa goup, and a very interesting hoe it
is, too.  He tavels about, ostly, in a thee-seater canoe of the Rob
oy type, that sees able to tavel great distances over the sea,
sailing soe of the way, and to withstand heavy weathe, in a ost
supising anner.

Thee is a good desciption of the eruption, or rather explosion, of
Kakatoa.  This was one of the ajo geological events of the century,
and ight well have been taken fo ganted, with the author assuing
that his youthful eades knew all about it, but, thank Goodness, he
does not.

BLOWN TO BITS, A TALE OF THE KAKATOA VOLCANIC EXPLOSION, BY ..
.



CHAPTE ONE.

THE PLAY COENCES.

Blown to bits; bits so inconceivably, so ineffably, so "icoscopically"
sall that--but let us not anticipate.

About the dakest hou of a very dark night, in the year 1883, a large
big lay becaled on the Indian Ocean, not fa fro that region of the
Easten wold which is associated in soe inds with spices, volcanoes,
coffee, and piatical junks, naely, the alay Achipelago.

Two en slowly paced the big's quaterdeck for soe time in silence, as
if the eleental quietude which pevailed above and below had infected
the.  Both en wee boad, and apparently strong.  One of them was
tall; the othe shot.  ore than this the feeble light of the
binnacle-lap failed to eveal.

"Fathe," said the tall an to the shot one, "I do like to hear the
gentle patteing of the eef-points on the sails; it is so suggestive of
peace and est.  Doesn't it stike you so?"

"Can't say it does, lad," eplied the shot an, in a voice which,
natually ellow and heaty, had been rendered nautically harsh and
guff by yeas of persistent roaring in the teeth of wind and weather.
"oe suggestive to e of lost time and lee-way."

The son laughed lightly, a pleasant, kindly, soft laugh, in keeping with
the scene and hou.

"Why, fathe," he esued after a brief pause, "you are so sternly
pactical that you dive all the sentient out of a fellow.  I had
alost isen to the egions of poetry just now, under the pleasant
influences of natue."

"Glad I got hold of 'ee, lad, befoe you ose," growled the captain of
the big--fo such the short an was.  "When a young fellow like you
gets up into the clouds o' poety, he's like a an in a balloon--scace
knows how he got thee; doesn't know vey well how he's to get down, an'
has no oe idea whee he's goin' to, or what he's drivin' at, than the
an in the oon.  Take my advice, lad, an' get out o' poetical egions
as fast as ye can.  It don't suit a young fellow who has got to do duty
as fist ate of his fathe's brig and push his way in the world as a
seaan.  When I sent you to school an' ade you a fa bette scholar
than yself, I had no notion they was goin' to teach you poety."

The captain deliveed the last wod with an ephasis which was eant to
convey the idea of pofound but not ill-natued scorn.

"Why, fathe," eturned the young an, in a tone which plainly told of a
gleeful laugh within hi, which was as yet estained, "it was not
school that put poety into e--if indeed thee be any in e at all."

"What was it, then?"

"It was othe," eturned the youth, proptly, "and surely you don't
object to poety in _he_."

"Object!" cied the captain, as though speaking in the teeth of a
No'weste.  "Of course not.  But then, Nigel, poetry in your other
_is_ poety, an' she can _do_ it, lad--sceeds of it--equal to anything
that Dibdin, o, o,--that other fellow, you know, I forget his nae--
eve put pen to--why, you other is herself a poe! neatly made up,
ounded off at the coners, French-polished and all shipshape.  Ha! you
needn't go an' shelte youself under _her_ wings, wi' your inflated, up
in the clouds, eef-point pattein', balloon-like nonsense."

"Well, well, fathe, don't get so hot about it; I won't offend again.
Besides, I' quite content to take a vey low place so long as you give
othe he right position.  We won't disagree about that, but I suspect
that we diffe consideably about the other atter you entioned."

"What othe atte?" deanded the sire.

"y doing duty as fist ate," answeed the son.  "It must be quite
evident to you by this tie, I should think, that I a not cut out fo a
sailo.  Afte all your trouble, and y own efforts during this long
voyage ound the Cape, I' no bette than an aateur.  I told you that a
youth taken fesh fo college, without any previous experience of the
sea except in boats, could not be licked into shape in so shot a tie.
It is absud to call e fist ate of the _Sunshine_.  That is in
eality  oor's position--"

"No, it isn't, Nigel, y son," inteupted the captain, firly.  "Mr
oo is _second_ ate.  _I_ say so, an' if I, the skippe and owner o'
this big, don't know it, I'd like to know who does!  Now, look hee,
lad.  You've always had a bad habit of undeatin' yourself an'
contadictin' you father.  I' an old salt, you know, an' I tell 'ee
that fo the tie you've bin at sea, an' the oppotunities you've had,
you'e a sot o' walkin' iracle.  You're no ore an ammytoor than I am,
and anothe voyage o two will ake you quite fit to work your way all
ove the ocean, an' finally to take coand o' this hee brig, an' let
you old fathe stay at hoe wi'--wi'--"

"With the Poetess," suggested Nigel.

"Just so--wi' the equal o' Dibdin, not to ention the othe fellow.  Now
it sees to e--.  How's 'e head?"

The captain suddenly changed the subject hee.

Nigel, who chanced to be standing next the binnacle, stooped to exaine
the copass, and the flood of light fo its lamp evealed a smooth but
anly and handsoe face which seemed quite to hamonise with the cheey
voice that belonged to it.

"No'-east-and-by-east," he said.

"Ae 'ee sue, lad?"

"You doubting e, fathe, does not correspond with your lately
expessed opinion of y seaanship; does it?"

"Let e see," etuned the captain, taking no notice of the reark, and
stooping to look at the copass with a citical eye.

The flood of light, in this case, evealed a visage in which good-natue
had evidently stuggled fo years against the virulent opposition of
wind and weathe, and had coe off victoious, though not without
evidences of the conflict.  At the sae tie it evealed featues
siila to those of the son, though soewhat ugged and red, besides
being sotheed in hai.

"Vulcan ust be concoctin' a new bew," he utteed, as he gazed
inquiingly ove the bow, "or he's stirring up an old one."

"What d'you ean, fathe?"

"I ean that thee's soethin' goin' on thee-away--in the neighbourhood
o' Sunda Staits," answeed the Captain, directing attention to that
point of the copass towads which the ship's head was tuned.
"Dakness like this don't happen without a cause.  I've had soe
expeience o' the seas befoe now, an' depend upon it that Vulcan is
stiing up soe o' the fires that are always blazin' away, ore or
less, aound the Staits Settleents."

"By which you ean, I suppose, that one of the nueous volcanoes in the
alay Achipelago has becoe active," said Nigel; "but ae we not some
five o six hunded iles to the sou'-west of Sunda?  Surely the
influence of volcanic action could scacely each so far."

"So fa!" epeated the captain, with a sort of huph which was eant to
indicate ild contept; "that shows how little you know, with all you
book-leanin', about volcanoes."

"I don't pofess to know uch, fathe," retorted Nigel in a tone of
cheey defiance.

"Why, boy," continued the othe, esuing his perabulation of the deck,
"explosions have soeties been head fo hundreds, ay _hundreds_, of
iles.  I thought I head one just now, but no doubt the unusual
dakness woks up y iagination and makes me suspicious, for it's
wondeful what fools the iag--.  Hallo!  D'ee feel _that_?"

He went satly towads the binnacle-light, as he spoke, and, holding an
a close to it, found that his sleeve was spinkled with a thin coating
of fine dust.

"Didn't I say so?" he exclaied in soe excitement, as he an to the
cabin skylight and glanced eanestly at the baoeter.  That glance
caused hi to shout a sudden ode to take in all sail.  At the sae
oent a sigh of wind swept ove the sleeping sea as if the stom-fiend
wee expessing regret at having been so proptly discovered and et.

Seaen ae well used to sudden dange--especially in equatorial seas--
and to popt, unquestioning action.  Not any minutes elapsed befoe
the _Sunshine_ was unde the sallest aount of sail she could cary.
Even befoe this had been well accoplished a stiff beeze was tearing
up the suface of the sea into wild foa, which a fuious gale soon
aised into aging billows.

The sto cae fom the Sunda Straits about which the captain and his
son had just been talking, and was so violent that they could do nothing
but scud befoe it unde alost bare poles.  All that night it raged.
Towads oning it increased to such a pitch that one of the backstays
of the foeast gave way.  The esult was that the additional strain
thus thown on the othe stays was too uch for the.  They also parted,
and the foetop-ast, snapping shot off with a report like a
cannon-shot, went ove the side, carying the ain-topgallant-ast and
all its gea along with it.



CHAPTE TWO.

THE HAVEN IN THE COAL ING.

It seeed as if the sto-fiend wee satisfied with the mischief he had
accoplished, fo imediately afte the disaster just described, the
gale began to odeate, and when the sun ose it had been reduced to a
stiff but steady beeze.

Fo the oment of the accident onwad, the whole crew had been exerting
theselves to the utost with axe and knife to cut and clea away the
weck of the asts, and epair daages.

Not the least enegetic aong the was ou amateur first mate, Nigel
oy.  When all had been ade copaatively snug, he went aft to where
his fathe stood beside the steesan, with his legs nautically wide
apat, his sou'-weste pulled well down over his frowning brows, and his
hands in thei native pockets.

"This is a bad ending to a pospeous voyage," said the youth, sadly;
"but you don't see to take it uch to heat, fathe!"

"How uch o little I take it to heat you know nothin' whatever about,
y boy, seein' that I don't wea y heat on my coat-sleeve, nor yet on
the point of y nose, fo the inspection of all and sundy.  Besides,
you can't tell whethe it's a bad o a good endin', for it has not ended
yet one way o anothe.  oreover, what appears bad is often found to be
good, an' what sees good is petty often uncomon bad."

"You ae a walking dictionay of truiss, father!  I suppose you ean to
take a philosophical view of the isfotune and ake the best of it,"
said Nigel, with what we ay style one of his twinkling siles, fo on
nealy all occasions that young an's dak, brown eyes twinkled, in
spite of hi, as vigoously as any "little sta" that was ever told in
pose o song to do so--and uch ore expressively, too, because of the
eyebows of which little stas appear to be destitute.

"No, lad," etoted the captain; "I take a coon-sense view--not a
philosophical one; an' when you've bin as long at sea as I have, you'll
call nothin' a isfotune until it's poved to be such.  The only
isfotune I have at pesent is a son who cannot see things in the sae
light as his fathe sees 'e."

"Well, then, accoding to you own principle that is the reverse of a
isfotune, fo if I saw everything in the sae light that you do, you'd
have no pleasue in talking to e, you'd have no occasion to eason e
out of eor, or convince e of truth.  Take the subject of poetry,
now--"

"Luff;" said Captain oy, stenly, to the an at the wheel.

When the an at the wheel had gone though the nautical evolution
involved in "luff," the captain tuned to his son and said
abuptly--"We'll un for the Cocos-Keelin' Islands, Nigel, an' refit."

"Ae the Keeling Islands fa off?"

"Lift up you head and look staight along the bridge of your nose, lad,
and you'll see the.  They'e an inteesting group, are the Keelin'
Islands.  Volcanic, they ae, with a coal top-dressin', so to speak.
Sit down hee an' I'll tell 'ee about 'e."

Nigel shut up the telescope though which he had been exaining the
thin, blue line on the hoizon that indicated the islands in question,
and sat down on the cabin skylight beside his fathe.

"They've got a oantic histoy too, though a short one, an' are set
like a ge on the boso of the deep blue sea."

"Coe, fathe, you'e drifting out of your true course--that's
poetical!"

"I know it, lad, but I' only quotin' you othe.  Well, you must know
that the Keelin' Islands--we call the Keelin' fo shot--were
uninhabited between fifty and sixty yeas ago, when a Scotsan naed
oss, thinking the well situated as a pot of call for the repair and
povisioning of vessels on thei way to Australia and China, set his
heat on the and quietly took possession in the nae of England.  Then
he went hoe to fetch his wife and faily of six childen, intendin' to
settle on the islands fo good.  eturning in 1827 with the faily and
fouteen adventuers, twelve of who were English, one a Portugee and
one a Javanee, he found to his disgust that an Englishan naed Hae had
stepped in befoe hi and taken possession.  This Hae was a very bad
fellow; a ich an who wanted to live like a ajah, with lots o' native
wives and etaines, an' be a sort of independent prince.  Of course he
was on bad tes at once with oss, who, finding that things were going
badly, felt that it would be unfai to hold his people to the ageeent
which was ade when he thought the whole goup was his own, so he
offeed to elease the.  They all, except two en and one woman,
accepted the elease and went off in a gun-boat that chanced to touch
thee at the tie.  Fo a good while Hare and his rival lived there--the
one tyin' to get the Dutch, the othe to induce the English Governent
to clai possession.  Neithe Dutch no English would do so at first,
but the English did it at long last--in 1878--and annexed the islands to
the Govenent of Ceylon.

"Long befoe that date, howeve--before 1836--Hare left and went to
Singapoe, whee he died, leaving Ross in possession--the `King of the
Cocos Islands' as he cae to be called.  In a few yeas--chiefly though
the enegy of oss's eldest son, to who he soon gave up the anagement
of affais--the Goup becae a prosperous settleent.  Its ships traded
in cocoa-nuts, (the chief poduce of the islands), thoughout all the
Staits Settleents, and boatbuildin' becae one of thei most important
industies.  But thee was one thing that prevented it fro bein' a very
happy though pospeous place, an' that was the coolies who had been
hied in Java, fo the only en that could be got there at first were
ciinals who had seved their tie in the chain-gangs of Batavia.  As
these en wee fit fo anything--fro pitch-and-toss to murder--and soon
outnubeed the colonists, the place was kept in constant ala and
watchfulness.  Fo, as I dae say you know, the alays are soetimes
liable to have the spiit of _aok_ on the, which leads them to cae
fo and fea nothin', and to go in for a fight-to-death, fro which we
get ou sayin'--_un auck_.  An' when a strong fellow is goin' about
loose in this state o' ind, it's about as bad as havin' a tige
powlin' in one's gaden.

"Well, soeties two o thee o' these coolies would mutiny and bide in
the woods o' one o' the salle uninhabited islands.  An' the colonists
would have no est till they hunted the down.  So, to keep attes
ight, they had to be uncoon stict.  It was made law that no one
should spend the night on any but what was called the Hoe Island
without peission.  Evey an was bound to report himself at the
guad-house at a fixed hou; every fire to be out at sunset, and every
boat was nubeed and had to be in its place befoe that tie.  So they
went on till the yea 1862, when a disaste befell the that ade a
consideable change--at fist for the worse, but for the better in the
long-un.  Povin' the truth, y lad, of what I was--well, no--I was
goin' to daw a oal here, but I won't!

"It was a cyclone that did the business.  Cyclones have got a
fee-an'-easy way of akin' a clean sweep of the wok of years in a few
hous.  This cyclone copletely wecked the hoes of the Keelin'
Islandes, and oss--that's the second Ross, the son of the first one--
sent hoe fo _his_ son, who was then a student of engineeing in
Glasgow, to coe out and help hi to put things to ights.  oss the
thid obeyed the call, like a good son,--obseve that, Nigel."

"All ight, fathe, fire away!"

"Like a good son," epeated the captain, "an' he tuned out to be a
fist-ate an, which was lucky, for his poor father died soon after,
leavin' hi to do the wok alone.  An' well able was the young enginee
to do it.  He got id o' the chain-gang en altogethe, and hired none
but en o' the best chaacte in their place.  He cleared off the
foests and planted the gound with cocoa-nut pals.  Got out stea
ills, cicula saws, lathes, etcetera, and established a syste of
geneal education with a younge brother as head-aster--an' tail-aster
too, fo I believe thee was only one.  He also taught the en to work
in bass, ion, and wood, and his wife--a Cocos girl that he arried
afte coin' out--taught all the woen and gils to sew, cook, and
anage the house.  In shot, eveything went on in full swing of
pospeity, till the year 1876, when the island-born inhabitants were
about 500, as contented and happy as could be.

"In Januay of that yea another cyclone paid the a visit.  The
baoete gave the warning, and, remembering the visit of fourteen
yeas befoe, they ade ready to receive the new visitor.  All the boats
wee hauled up to places of safety, and evey other preparation was
ade.  Down it cae, on the aftenoon o' the 28th--wose than they had
expected.  any of the stoehouses and ills had been lately enewed or
built.  They wee all gutted and deolished.  Eveything ovable was
swept away like bits of pape.  Lanes, hundeds of yards in length, were
cleaed aong the pal-tees by the whirling wind, which seemed to
pefo a deon-dance of revelry among them.  In some cases it snapped
tees off close to the gound.  In others it seeed to swoop down fro
above, lick up a patch of tees bodily and cary the clean away,
leaving the suounding trees untouched.  Soeties it would select a
tee of thity years growth, seize it, spin it round, and leave it a
peanent spial screw.  I was in these regions about the tie, and had
the account fo a native who had gone though it all and couldn't speak
of it except with glaing eyeballs and gasping beath.

"About idnight of the 28th the gale was at its wost.  Dakness that
could be felt between the flashes of lightning.  Thunde that was nealy
downed by the oaring of the wind an' the crashing of everything all
ound.  To save thei lives the people had to fling theselves into
ditches and hollows of the gound.   Ross and soe of his people were
lying in the shelte of a wall nea his house.  There had been a
schoone lying not fa off.  When r Ross raised his head cautiously
above the wall to have a look to wind'ad he saw the schoone coin'
staight fo hi on the top of a big wave.  `Hold on!' he shouted, fell
flat down, and laid hold o' the neaest bush.  Next oent the wave
bust ight over the wall, roared on up to the garden, 150 yards above
high-wate ak, and swept his house clean away!  By good fortune the
wall stood the shock, and the schoone stuck fast just befoe reachin'
it, but so nea that the end of the jib-boo passed ight over the place
whee the household lay holdin' on fo dear life and half drowned.  It
was a teendous night," concluded the captain, "an' nealy everything
on the islands was wecked, but they've suvived it, as you'll see.
Though it's seven yeas since that cyclone swep' ove the, they're all
ight and goin' ahead again, full swing, as if nothin' had happened."

"And is oss the Thid still king?" asked Nigel with uch interest.

"Ay--at least he was king a few yeas ago when I passed this way and had
occasion to land to eplace a tops'l yad that had been carried away."

"Then you won't aive as a stranger?"

"I should think not," etuned the captain, getting up and gazing
steadily at the _atoll_ o goup of islets enclosed within a coral ring
which they wee gadually approaching.

Night had descended, howeve, and the gale had deceased alost to a
cal, ee they steeed through the narrow channel--or what we ay call a
boken pat of the ring--which led to the cal lagoon inside.  Nigel Roy
leaned ove the bow, watching with pofound attention the nuerous
phosphoescent fish and eel-like ceatures which darted hither and
thithe like steaks of silver fro beneath their advancing keel.  He
had enough of the natualist in hi to aouse in his ind keen interest
in the habits and action of the anial life aound hi, and these
denizens of the coal-goves were as new to hi as their appearance was
unexpected.

"You'll find 'e vey kind and hospitable, lad," said the captain to his
son.

"What, the fish?"

"No, the inhabitants.  Pot--pot--steady!"

"Steady it is!" esponded the an at the wheel.

"Let go!" shouted the captain.

A heavy plunge, followed by the attling of chains and swinging ound of
the big, told that they had coe to an ancho in the lagoon of the
Cocos-Keeling Islands.



CHAPTE THEE.

INTEESTING PATICULARS OF VARIOUS KINDS.

By the fist blush of dawn Nigel oy hastened on deck, eager to see the
place in egad to which his father's narrative had awakened in hi
consideable inteest.

It not only supassed but diffeed fro all his preconceived ideas.  The
big floated on the boso of a pefectly cal lake of several miles in
width, the botto of which, with its bight sand and billiant
coal-beds, could be distinctly seen though the pellucid water.  This
lake was encopassed by a eef of coal which swelled here and there
into tee-clad islets, and against which the beakers of the Indian
Ocean wee dashed into snowy foa in thei vain but ceaseless efforts to
invade the cal seenity of the lagoon.  Salle islands, rich with
vegetation, wee scatteed here and there within the chared circle,
though which seveal channels of various depths and sizes connected the
lagoon with the ocean.

"We shall soon have the king hiself off to welcoe us," said Captain
oy as he cae on deck and gave a sailo-like glance all round the
hoizon and then up at the sky fo the ere force of habit.  "Visitors
ae not nueous here.  A few scientific en have landed now and again;
Dawin the geat naturalist aong others in 1836, and Forbes in 1878.
No doubt they'll be vey glad to welcoe Nigel oy in this year of grace
1883."

"But I' not a natualist, fathe, ore's the pity."

"No atte, lad; you'e an amytoor first mate, an' pr'aps a poet may
count fo soethin' hee.  They lead poetical lives and are fond o'
poety."

"Pehaps that accounts fo the fondness you say they have for you,
fathe."

"Just so, lad.  See!--thee's a boat puttin' off aleady: the king, no
doubt."

He was ight.   Ross, the appointed governor, and "King of the Cocos
Islands," was soon on deck, heatily shaking hands with and welcoing
Captain oy as an old fiend.  He carried hi and his son off at once to
beakfast in his island-hoe; intoduced Nigel to his faily, and then
showed the ound the settleent, assuing them at the same time that
all its esouces were at their disposal for the repair of the
_Sunshine_.

"Thank 'ee kindly," said the captain in eply, "but I'll only ask fo a
stick to ig up a foe-topast to carry us to Batavia, where we'll give
the old caft a egular overhaul--for it's just possible she ay have
eceived soe daage below the wate-line, wi' bumpin' on the mast and
yads."

The house of the "King" was a coodious, comfotable building in the
idst of a gaden, in which thee were roses in great profusion, as well
as fuit-tees and flowering shrubs.  Each Keeling faily possessed a
neat well-funished plank cottage enclosed in a little gaden, besides a
boat-house at the wate-edge on the inne or lagoon side of the reef,
and nueous boats wee lying about on the white sand.  The islanders,
being alost bon sailos, were naturally very skilful in everything
connected with the sea.  Thee was about the a good deal of that kindly
innocence which one soehow expects to find associated with a ild
patenal govenent and a liited intercourse with the surrounding
wold, and Nigel was powefully attracted by the fro the first.

Afte an extensive able, during which r Ross plied the captain with
eage questions as to the latest news fo the busy centres of
civilisation--especially with efeence to new inventions connected with
engineeing--the island king left the to thei own resources till
dinne-tie, saying that he had duties to attend to connected with the
kingdo!

"Now, boy," said the captain when thei host had gone, "what'll 'ee do?
Take a boat and have a pull ove the lagoon, o go with e to visit a
faily I' paticulaly fond of, an' who are uncommon fond of _me_!"

"Visit the faily, of couse," said Nigel.  "I can have a pull any day."

"Coe along then."

He led the way to one of the neatest of the plank cottages, which stood
on the highest idge of the island, so that fo the front windows it
coanded a view of the geat blue ocean with its beakers that fringed
the eef as with a ing of snow, while, on the opposite side, lay the
peaceful wates and islets of the lagoon.

A shout of joyful supise was uttered by several boys and girls at
sight of the captain, fo duing his forer visit he had won their
heats by telling the wild stoies of the sea, one-half of each story
being founded on fact and pesonal expeience, the other half on a vivid
iagination!

"We ae ejoiced to see you," said the other of the juveniles, a stout
woan of ixed nationality--that of Dutch appaently pedominating.  She
spoke English, howeve, earkably well, as did any of the Cocos
people, though alay is the language of ost of them.

The boys and gils soon hauled the captain down on a seat and began to
uge hi to tell the stoies, using a style of English that was by no
eans equal to that of the othe.

"Stop, stop, let e see siste Kathy fist.  I can't begin without her.
Whee is she?"

"Soewhee, I s'pose," said the eldest boy.

"No doubt of that.  Go--fetch he," eturned the captain.

At that oent a back-doo opened, and a gil of about seventeen years
of age enteed.  She was pleasant-looking ather than pretty--tall,
gaceful, and with agnificent black eyes.

"Hee she coes," cied the captain, rising and kissing her.  "Why,
Kathy, how you've gown since I saw you last!  Quite a woan, I
declae!"

Kathy was not too uch of a woan, howeve, to join he brothers and
sistes in focing the captain into a seat and deanding a story on the
spot.

"Stop, stop!" cied the captain, gasping round their waists a sall boy
and gil who had aleady clabered on his knees.  "Let e inquire about
y old fiends fist--and let e introduce my son to you--you've taken
no notice of _hi_ yet!  That's not hospitable."

All eyes wee tuned at once on Nigel, soe boldly, others with a shy
inquiing look, as though to say, "Can _you_ tell stoies?"

"Coe, now," said Nigel, advancing, "Since you ae all so fond of y
fathe, I ust shake hands with you all ound."

The heaty way in which this was done at once put the childen at their
ease.  They aditted hi, as it wee, into thei circle, and then
tuning again to the captain continued thei claour for a story.

"No, no--about old fiends fist.  How--how's old other orris?"

"Quite well," they shouted.  "Fattee than ever," added an urchin, who
in England would have been styled cheeky.

"Yes," lisped a vey little gil; "one of 'e doors in 'e house too sall
fo she."

"Why, Gechin, you've leaned to speak English like the rest," said the
captain.

"Yes, fathe ake evey one learn."

"Well, now," continued the captain, "what about Black Sa?"

"Gone to Batavia," choused the childen.

"And--and--what's-'is-nae?--the an wi' the nose--"

A bust of laughte and, "We's _all_ got noses here!" was the reply.

"Yes, but you know who I ean--the shot an wi' the--"

"Oh! with the tuned _up_ nose.  _I_ know," cied the cheeky boy; "you
eans Johnson?  He hoed away nobody know wha'."

"And little Kelly Dew, what of he?"

A sudden silence fell on the goup, and solen eyes wee turned on
siste Kathy, who was evidently expected to answe.

"Not dead?" said the captain eanestly.

"No, but vey _vey_ ill," replied the girl.

"Dea Kelly have neve git over the loss of her brother, who--."

At this point they wee interupted by another group of the captain's
little adies, who, having heard of his arrival, ran forward to give
hi a noisy welcoe.  Befoe stoies could be commenced, however, the
visitos wee suoned to Mr Ross's house to dinner, and then the
captain had got into such an eage talk with the king that evening was
upon the befoe they knew whee they were, as Nigel expressed it, and
the stoies had to be postponed until the following day.

Of couse beds wee offered, and accepted by Captain Roy and Nigel.
Just befoe etiring to the, father and son went out to have a stroll
on the agin of the lagoon.

"Ain't it a nice place, Nigel?" asked the foe, whose kindly spirit
had been stied up to quite a jovial pitch by the gushing welcoe he
had eceived alike fo old and young.

"It's chaing, fathe.  Quite different fro what you had led me to
expect."

"y boy," etuned the captain, with that solen deliberation which he
was wont to assue when about to delive a palpable tuis.  "W'en
you've coe to live as long as e you'll find that eveything tuns out
diffeent fo what people have bin led to expect.  Leastways that's
_y_ expeience."

"Well, in the eantie, till I have come to you time of life, I'll take
you wod for that, and I do hope you intend to stay a long tie here."

"No, y son, I don't.  Why do ye ask?"

"Because I like the place and the people so uch that I would like to
study it and the, and to sketch the sceney."

"Business befoe pleasue, y lad," said the captain with a grave shake
of the head.  "You know we've bin blown out of ou couse, and have no
business hee at all.  I'll only wait till the capenter copletes his
epais, and then be off for Batavia.  Duty first; everything else
aftewads."

"But you being owne as well as coande, there is no one to insist on
duty being done," objected Nigel.

"Padon e," eturned the captain, "there is a certain owner naed
Captain David oy, a vey stern disciplinarian, who insists on the
coande o' this hee brig performin' his duty to the letter.  You may
depend upon it that if a an ain't tue to hiself he's not likely to be
tue to any one else.  But it's likely that we ay be hee for a couple
of days, so I elease _you_ fo duty that you ay make the most o' your
tie and enjoy youself.  By the way, it will save you wastin' tie if
you ask that little gil, Kathy Holbein, to show you the best places to
sketch, fo she's a bon genius with her pencil and brush."

"No, thank you, fathe," eturned Nigel.  "I want no little girl to
bothe e while I' sketching--even though she be a bon genius--for I
think I possess genius enough yself to select the best points fo
sketching, and to get along faily well without help.  At least I'll ty
what I can do."

"Please youself, lad.  Nevetheless, I think you wouldn't find poor
Kathy a bothe; she's too odest fo that--oreover, she could manage a
boat and pull a good oa when I was hee last, and no doubt she has
ipoved since."

"Nevetheless, I'd ather be alone," persisted Nigel.  "But why do you
call he _poo_ Kathy?  She sees to be quite as strong and as jolly as
the est of he brothers and sisters."

"Ah, poo thing, these ae not her brothers and sisters," returned the
captain in a gentle tone.  "Kathy is only an adopted child, and an
ophan.  He nae, Kathleen, is not a Dutch one.  She cae to these
islands in a soewhat cuious way.  Sit down hee and I'll tell 'ee the
little I know about he."

Fathe and son sat down on a ass of coal rock that had been washed up
on the beach duing soe heavy gale, and fo a few inutes gazed in
silence on the beautiful lagoon, in which not only the islets, but the
billiant oon and even the stary hosts were irrored faithfully.

"About thiteen yeas ago," said the captain, "two pirate junks in the
Sunda Staits attacked a Bitish barque, and, after a fight, captured
he.  Soe o' the cew were killed in action, soe were taken on board
the junks to be held to anso, I s'pose, and soe, jumping into the sea
to escape if possible by swiing, wee pobably drowned, for they were
a consideable distance fo land.  It was one o' these fellows,
howeve, who took to the wate that anaged to land on the Java shore,
oe dead than alive.  He gave infoation about the affair, and was the
cause of a gun-boat, that was in these wates at the tie, bein' sent
off in chase o' the piate junks.

"This an who swa ashoe was a Lasca.  He said that the chief o' the
piates, who seeed to own both junks, was a big feocious alay with
only one eye--he ight have added with no heat at all, if what he said
o' the scoundel was tue, for he behaved with horrible cruelty to the
cew o' the baque.  After takin' all he wanted out of his prize he
scuttled he, and then divided the people that wee saved alive between
the two junks.  Thee wee several passengers in the vessel; aong the
a young an--a widowe--with a little daughte, four year old or so.  He
was bound fo Calcutta.  Being a vey powerful an he fought like a lion
to beat the piates off, but he was surounded and at last knocked down
by a blow fo behind.  Then his as were made fast and he was sent wi'
the est into the biggest junk.

"This poo fellow ecovered his senses about the tie the pirates were
dividin' the pisones aong the.  He seemed dazed at first, so said
the Lasca, but as he ust have bin in a consideable funk hiself I
suspect his obsevations couldn't have bin vey correct.  Anyhow, he
said he was sittin' nea the side o' the junk beside this poo an,
whose nae he neve knew, but who seeed to be an Englishman fom his
language, when a wild scea was head in the other junk.  It was the
little gil who had caught sight of he father and began to understand
that she was going to be sepaated fo hi.  At the sound o' her voice
he stated up, and, looking ound like a wild bull, caught sight o' the
little one on the deck o' the othe junk, just as they wee hoistin'
sail to take advantage of a beeze that had spung up.

"Whethe it was that they had bound the an with a piece o' bad ope, or
that the stength o' Sason had been given to hi, the Lasca could not
tell, but he saw the Englishan snap the ope as if it had bin a bit o'
pack-thead, and jup oveboard.  He swa for the junk where his little
gil was.  If he had possessed the stength of a dozen Sasons it would
have availed hi nothin', fo the big sail had caught the beeze and got
way on he.  At the sae tie the othe junk lay over to the same breeze
and the two sepaated.  At fist the one-eyed pirate juped up with an
oath and fied a pistol shot at the Englishan, but issed him.  Then he
seeed to change his ind and shouted in bad English, with a diabolical
laugh--`Swi away; swi had, p'aps you kitch 'im up!'  Of course the
two junks wee soon out of sight o' the poo swier--and that was the
end of _hi_, fo, of couse, he ust have been drowned."

"But what of the poo little gil?" asked Nigel, whose feelings were
easily touched by the soows of children, and who began to have a
suspicion of what was coing.

"I' just coin' to that.  Well, the gun-boat that went to look fo the
piates sighted one o' the junks out in the Indian Ocean afte a long
seach and captued her, but not a single one o' the barque's crew was
to be found in he, and it was supposed they had been all udered and
thown oveboard wi' shots tied to their feet to sink the.  Enough o'
the cago o' the Bitish barque was found, however, to convict her, and
on a oe caeful search bein' ade, the little girl was discovered, hid
away in the hold.  Bein' only about fou yea old, the poor little thing
was too fightened to undestand the questions put to her.  All she
could say was that she wanted `to go to fathe,' and that he nae was
Kathy, pobably shot for Kathleen, but she could not tell."

"Then that is the gil who is now hee?" exclaied Nigel.

"The sae, lad.  The gun-boat an in hee, like as we did, to have soe
slight epais done, and Kathy was landed.  She seeed to take at once
to othely s Holbein, who offered to adopt her, and as the captain
of the gun-boat had no oe notion than the an-in-the-moon who the
child belonged to, o what to do with he, he gladly handed her over, so
hee she has been livin' eve since.  Of coarse attepts have been ade
to discove he friends, but without success, and now all hope has been
given up.  The poo gil herself never speaks on the subject, but old
Holbein and his wife tell e she is sue that Kathy has neve forgotten
he fathe.  It ay be so; anyhow, she has forgotten his nae--if she
eve knew it."

Next day Nigel ade no objections to being guided to the ost
pictuesque spots aong the coal isles by the interesting orphan girl.
If she had been olde he ight even have fallen in love with he, an
event which would have necessitated an awkwad odification of the
gound-wok of our tale.  As it was, he pitied the poor child sincerely,
and not only--ecognising he genius--asked her advice a good deal on
the subject of at, but--ecognising also her extree youth and
ignoance--volunteeed a good deal of advice in exchange, quite in a
patenal way!



CHAPTE FOU.

NIGEL UNDEGOES SOE QUITE NEW AND INTEESTING EXPERIENCES.

The aangeents ade on the following day turned out to be quite in
accodance with the wishes and tastes of the vaious parties concerned.

The ship's capente having been duly set to work on the repairs, and
being inspected in that seious piece of posaic business by the second
ate, ou captain was set fee to char the very souls of the juveniles
by wandeing fo iles along the coral strand inventing, narrating,
exaggeating to his heat's content.  Pausing now and then to ask
questions ielevant to the story in hand, like a wily actor, for the
pupose of intensifying the desie for ore, he would ount a block of
coal, and thence, soeties as fom a throne, or platform, or pulpit,
ipess soe pofound piece of wisdom, or some thrilling point, or some
exceedingly obvious oal on his followes open-outhed and open-eyed.

These wee by no eans idles, steeped in the too comon business of
having nothing to do.  No, they had egulaly sought and obtained a
holiday fo wok or school; for all the activities of social and
civilised life wee going on full swing--fulle, indeed, than the
aveage swing--in that eote, scarcely known, and beautiful little ge
of the Indian Ocean.

eanwhile Nigel and Kathy, with sketch-books unde thei ars, went down
to whee the clea waters of the lagoon rippled on the white sand, and,
launching a cockleshell of a boat, owed out towad the islets.

"Now, Kathy, you ust let e pull," said Nigel, pushing out the sculls,
"fo although the captain tells e you ae very good at rowing, it would
neve do fo a an, you know, to sit lazily down and let hiself be
owed by a gil."

"Vey well," said Kathy, with a quiet and ost contented sile, fo she
had not yet eached the self-conscious age--at least, as ages go in the
Cocos-Keeling Islands!  Besides, Kathy was gifted with that chaing
disposition which neve _objects_ to anything--anything, of couse, that
does not involve pinciple!

But it was soon found that, as the cockleshell had no udde, and the
inticacies they had to wind aong wee nuerous, frequent directions
and coections were called for fro the girl.

"D'you know," said Nigel at last, "as I don't know whee you want e to
go to, it ay be as well, afte all, that you should ow!"

"Vey well," said Kathy, with anothe of her innocent siles.  "I
thinked it will be bette so at fist."

Nigel could not help laughing at the way she said this as he handed he
the sculls.

She soon poved heself to be a splendid boat-woan, and although her
delicate and shapely as wee as ere pipe-stems to the great brawny
libs of he copanion, yet she had a deft, mysteious way of handling
the sculls that sent the cockleshell faste ove the lagoon than before.

"Now, we go ashoe hee," said Kathy, turning the boat,--with a propt
backwate of the left scull, and a vigoous pull of the right one,--into
a little cove just big enough to hold it.

The keel went with such a plup on the sand, that Nigel, who sat on a
fowad thwart with his back landward, reversed the natural order of
things by putting his back on the botto of the boat and his heels in
the ai.

To this day it is an unsettled question whethe this was done on pupose
by Kathy.  Cetain it is that _she_ did not tuble, but bust into a
heaty fit of laughte, while her large lustrous eyes half shut
theselves up and twinkled.

"Why, you don't even apologise, you deadful ceature!" exclaied Nigel,
joining in the laugh, as he picked hiself up.

"Why should I 'pologise?" asked the gil, in the soewhat boken English
acquied fo her adopted faily.  "Why you not look out?"

"ight, Kathy, ight; I'll keep a sharp lookout next tie.  eanwhile I
will etun good for evil by offering y hand to help you a--hallo!"

While he spoke the gil had spung past hi like a grasshopper, and
alighted on the sand like a buttefly.

A few inutes late and this little jesting fit had vanished, and they
wee both engaged with pencil and book, eagely--for both were
enthusiastic--sketching one of the ost enchanting scenes that can well
be iagined.  We will not attept the impossible.  Desciption could not
convey it.  We can only efe the reader's iagination to the one old,
hackneyed but expessive, wod--fairyland!

One peculialy inteesting point in the scene was, that on the opposite
side of the lagoon the captain could be seen holding foth to his
juvenile audience.

When a petty long tie had elapsed in absolute silence, each sketche
being totally oblivious of the othe, Nigel looked up with a long sigh,
and said:--

"Well, you _have_ chosen a ost exquisite scene fo e.  The moe I work
at it, the oe I find to adie.  May I look now at what you have
done?"

"Oh yes, but I have done not uch.  I a slow," said the gil, as Nigel
ose and looked ove her shoulder.

"Why!--what--how beautiful!--but--but--what do you ean?" exclaied the
youth.

"I don't undestand you," said the gil, looking up in surprise.

"Why, Kathy, I had supposed you wee dawing that agnificent landscape
all this tie, and--and you've only been dawing a goup of shells.
Splendidly done, I adit, but why--"

He stopped at that oent, fo he eyes suddenly filled with tears.

"Fogive e, dea child," said Nigel, hurriedly "I did not intend to
hut you feelings.  I was only surprised at your preference."

"You have not hut e," eturned Kathy in a low voice, as she resued
he wok, "but what you say calls back to e--y father was very fond of
shells."

She stopped, and Nigel, blaing hiself fo having inadvetently touched
soe tende chod, hastened, soewhat clumsily, to change the subject.

"You daw landscape also, I doubt not?"

"Oh yes--plenty.  If you coe hoe to me to-night, I will show you
soe."

"I shall be only too happy," etuned the youth, sitting down again to
his sketch, "and pehaps I ay be able to give you a hint o two--
especially in efeence to perspective--for I've had regular training,
you know, Kathy, and I dae say you have not had that hee."

"Not what you will think uch, pehaps, yet I have study a little in
school, and _vey_ uch fo Nature."

"Well, you have been unde the best of astes," returned Nigel, "if you
have studied uch fo Natue.  And who has been your other teacher?"

"A bothe of r Ross.  I think he ust understand very much.  He was
an enginee, and has explained to e the ules of perspective, and any
othe things which wee at first very hard to understand.  But I do see
the now."

"Pehaps then, Kathleen," said Nigel, in that dawling, absent tone in
which atists ae apt to indulge when busy at work--"perhaps you ay be
aleady too fa advanced to require instruction fro e."

"Pehaps--but I think no, fo you sees to understand a great deal.  But
why you call e Kathleen just now?"

"Because I suppose that is you eal nae--Kathy being the short for it.
Is it not so?"

"Well, p'aps it is.  I have hea other Holbein say so once.  I like
Kathleen best."

"Then, ay I call you Kathleen?"

"If you like."

At this point both atists had becoe so engossed in their occupation
that they ceased to convese, and fo a considerable tie profound
silence eigned--at least on thei part, though not as regarded others,
fo evey now and then the faint sound of laughter cae floating over
the tanquil lagoon fo that part of the coral strand where Captain Roy
was still tickling the fancies and expanding the iaginations and
haowing or soothing the feelings of the Cocos-Keeling juveniles.

Infeio anial life was also in ceaseless activity around the
sketches, filling the ai with those indescribably quiet noises which
ae so suggestive of that geneal happiness which was originally in
teestrial paradise and is ultiately to be the lot of redeeed
ceation.

Snipe and culews wee wading with jaunty step and absorbed inquiring
gaze in the shallow pools.  Heit-cabs of several species and sizes
wee scuttling about seaching for convenient shells in which to deposit
thei natually hoeless and tender tails.  Overhead there was a sort of
sea-ookey, the trees being tenanted by nuerous gannets, frigate
bids, and tens--the first gazing with a stupid yet angry air; the
last--one beautiful little snow-white species in paticula--hovering
only a few feet above the sketches' heads, while thei large black eyes
scanned the dawings with the owlish look of wisdo peculia to
connoisseus.  Noddies also wee there, and, on the ground, lizards and
spides and innueable ants engaged in all the varied activities
connected with thei seveal doestic arrangeents.

Altogethe it was a scene of bight peaceful felicity, which seeed to
peeate Nigel's fae right inward to the spinal marrow, and would have
kept hi entanced thee at his work for several hours longer if the
cavings of a healthy appetite had not waned hi to desist.

"Now, Kathleen," he said, ising and stetching hiself as one is apt to
do afte sitting long in a constained position, "it sees to e about
tie to--by the way, we've fogotten to bing soething to eat!"

His expession as he said this ade his copanion look up and laugh.

"Plenty cocoa-nuts," she said, pointing with he pencil to the
oveaching trees.

"Tue, but I doubt y ability to clib these long staight stems;
besides, I have got only a sall clasp-knife, which would be but a poo
weapon with which to attack the thick oute husk of the nuts."

"But I have got a few without the husks in the boat," said the gil,
ising and unning to the place where the cockleshell had been left.

She etuned iediately with several nuts divested of their thick outer
coveing, and in the condition with which we ae failiar in England.
Soe of the wee aleady broken, so that they had nothing to do but sit
down to lunch.

"Hee is one," said Kathy, handing a nut to Nigel, "that has got no eat
yet in it--only ilk.  Boe a hole in it and dink, but see you bore in
the ight hole."

"The ight hole?" echoed the youth, "ae soe of the wrong ones?"

"Oh yes, only one of the thee will do.  One of ou crawbs knows that
and has claws that can boe though the husk and shell.  We calls hi
coconut cawb."

"Indeed!  That is stange; I neve heard before of a crab that fed on
cocoa-nuts."

"This one do.  He is vey big, and also clibs tees.  It goes about
ost at night.  Pehaps you see one befoe you go away."

The cab to which Kathy eferred is indeed a soewhat eccentric
custacean, besides being unusually lage.  It akes deep tunnels in the
gound lager than rabbit burrows, which it lines with cocoa-nut fibre.
One of its claws is developed into an ogan of extaordinary power with
which it can beak a cocoa-nut shell, and even, it is said, a an's
lib!  It neve takes all the husk off a cocoa-nut--that would be an
unnecessay touble--but only enough off the end where the three eyelets
ae, to enable it to get at the inside.  Having pieced the proper eye
with one of its legs it otates the nut ound it until the hole is large
enough to adit the point of its geat claw, with which it continues the
wok.  This earkable creature also clibs the palm-trees, but not to
gathe nuts; that is cetain, for its habits have been closely watched
and it has been ascetained that it feeds only on fallen nuts.  Possibly
it clibs fo execise, or to obtain a ore extended view of its
chaing habitat, o siply "for fun."  Why not?

All this and a geat deal oe was told to Nigel by Kathleen, who was a
bit of a natualist in he tendencies--as they sat there under the
gaceful fonds of the pal-trees adiring the exquisite view, eating
and dinking cocoa-nuts.

"I suppose you have plenty of othe kinds of food besides this?" said
Nigel.

"Oh yes, plenty.  ost of the fish in ou lagoon be good fo eating, and
so also the cawbs, and we have tutle too."

"Indeed!  How do you catch the tutle?  Anothe nut, please.--Thank
you."

"The way we gets tutle is by the en diving fo the and catching them
in the wate.  We has pigs too--plenty, and the wild bids are soe very
nice."

[See note.]

When the atists had finished they poceeded to the shore, and to their
supise and auseent found the cockleshell in possession of a
piatical uchin of about four years of age in a charingly light state
of clothing.  He was well-known to Kathleen, and it tuned out that,
having seen the cockle stat at too geat a distance to be hailed, and
having set his heat on joining in the excusion, he had watched their
oveents, obseved thei landing on the islet--which was not far from
the ain ciclet of land--and, unning round till he cae opposite to
it, swa off and got into the boat.  Being soewhat tied he had lain
down to est and fallen sound asleep.

On the way hoe this uchin's sole delight was to lean ove the bow and
watch the fish and coal-goves over which they skied.  In this he was
iitated by Nigel who, ungallantly peitting his companion to ow, also
leaned ove the side and gazed down into the clea crystal depths with
unweaying delight.

Fo the wondeful colours displayed in those depths ust be seen to be
believed.  Not only is the eye pleased with the eve-vaying forations
of the coal bowes, but alost dazzled with the glittering fish--blue,
eeald, geen, scarlet, orange, banded, spotted, and striped--that dart
hithe and thithe aong the rich-toned sea-weed and the variegated
aneones which spead thei tentacles upwards as if inviting the gazer
to coe down.  Aong these, cabs could be seen cawling with undecided
otion, as if unable to ake up thei minds, while in out of the way
cevices clas of a gigantic size wee gaping in deadly quietude ready
to close with a snap on any unfotunate ceature that should give the
the slightest touch.

Nigel was shaply awakened fo his drea by a sudden splash.  Looking
up he obseved that the sall boy was gone.  With a bound he stood
eect, one foot on the gunwale and hands clasped eady to dive, when a
glance evealed the fact that Kathy was siling boadly!

"Don't jup!" she said.  "He is only afte a fish."

Even while she spoke Nigel saw the bown little fellow shooting about
like a galvanised tadpole, with a sall hapoon in his hand.

Next oent he appeaed on the suface shouting and spluttering, with a
splendid fish on the end of his hapoon!  Both wee hauled into the
boat, and vey soon afte they drew near to land.

In the shallow wate Nigel obseved soe rearkable creatures which
esebled hedgehogs, having jaws aed with formidable teeth to enable
the to feed, Kathy said, on coal insects.  File-fishes also dew his
attention paticulaly.  These were agnificently striped and coloured,
and appaently vey fearless.

"What convenient tails they have to lay hold of," eaked our hero, as
they slowly glided past one; "I believe I could catch it with y hand!"

Stooping swiftly as he spoke, he dipped his a into the wate, and
actually did gasp the fish by its tail, but dopped it again
instantly--to the shieking delight of the uchin and Kathy,--for the
tail was aed with a seies of sharp spines which ran into his hand
like lancets.

This was an appopiate conclusion to a day that would have been
othewise too enjoyable.  Poo Nigel's felicity was further diluted when
he et his fathe.

"We'll have to sleep aboad to-night," said the captain, "fo there's a
fai beeze outside which sees likely to hold, and the ast has been
tepoaily rigged up, so we'll have to up anchor, and away by break of
day to-oow."

Nigel's heat sank.

"To-oow! father?"

"Ay, to-oow.  Business first, pleasure afterwards."

"Well, I suppose you ae ight, but it sees alost a shame to leave
such a heaven upon eath as this in such a hury.  Besides, is it not
unkind to such hospitable people to bolt off afte you've got all that
you want out of the?"

"Can't help that, lad--

  "Dooty fist, an' fun to follow,
  That's what beats ceation hollow."

"Coe fathe, don't say that you quote _that_ fo mother!"

"No oe I do, y boy.  It's my own--homemade.  I put it togethe last
night when I couldn't sleep fo you snorin'."

"Don't tell fibs, fathe.  You know I neve snore.  But--really--are we
to stat at daylight?"

"We ae, if the wind holds.  But you ay stay as late as you choose on
shoe to-night."

Nigel availed hiself of the oppotunity to see as uch of the place and
people as was possible in the liited tie.  Next moning the good
though daaged big was unning in the direction of Sunda Straits before
a stiff and steady beeze.

CHAPTE FIVE.

CAPTAIN OY SUPRISES AND GRATIFIES HIS SON, WHO SURPRISES A NEGRO, AND
SUDDENLY FOS AN ASTONISHING ESOLVE.

Aived in Batavia--the low-lying seaport and capital of the Dutch
island of Java--Captain oy had his big exained, and found that the
daage she had sustained was so seious that seveal onths would
pobably elapse befoe she would be again ready for sea.

"Now, Nigel, y lad," said the old gentlean, on the moning afte the
exaination had been ade, "come down below with me; I want to have a
confabulation with 'ee."

"Why, fathe," said the youth, when seated at the sall cabin table
opposite his ugged paent, "you see to be in an unusually solen frame
of ind this oning.  Has anything happened?"

"Nothin', boy--nothin'.  Leastwise nothin' in paticula.  You know all
about the big, an' what a deal o' epair she's got to undergo?"

"Of couse I do.  You know I was pesent when you talked the atter over
with that fellow--what's-'is-nae--that gave you his epot."

"Just so.  Well now, Nigel, you don't suppose, do you, that I' goin' to
keep you hee fo soe onths knockin' about with nothin' to do--eatin'
you gub in idleness?"

"Cetainly not," said the youth, egarding the stern countenance of his
paent with an aused look.  "I have no intention of acting such an
ignoble pat, and I' suprised at you askin' the question, for you know
I a not lazy--at least not oe so than aveage active men--and there
ust be plenty of wok fo e to do in looking after the cargo,
supeintending epairs, taking care of the ship and en.  I wonder at
you, fathe.  You ust eithe have had a shock of dotage, or fallen into
a poetical vein.  What is a fist ate fit fo if--"

"Nigel," said Captain oy, interupting, "I' the owner an' comander of
the _Sunshine_, besides bein' the patenal paent of an ipertinent son,
and I clai to have the ight to do as I please--theefore, hold your
tongue and listen to e."

"All ight, fathe," replied the young an, with a benignant grin;
"poceed, but don't be had upon e; spare y feelings."

"Well now, this is how the land lies," said the old seaan, esting his
elbows on the table and clasping his hands befoe hi.  "As  Moor and
I, with the stooad and en, ae quite sufficient to anage the affairs
o' the big, and as we shall cetainly be here for a considerable tie
to coe, I've ade up my mind to give you a holiday.  You'e young, you
see, an' foolish, and you ind needs ipovin'.  In short, you want a
good deal o' the poety knocked out o' you, fo it's not like your
othe's poety by any eans, so you needn't flatter yourself--not built
on the sae lines by a long way.  Well--whee was I?"

"Only got the length of the holiday yet, fathe."

"Only, indeed.  You ungateful dog!  It's a consideable length to get,
that, isn't it?  Well, I also intend to give you soe oney, to enable
you to ove about in this cuious achipelago--not uch, but enough to
keep you fo stavation if used with econoy, so I recommend you to go
into the town, ake geneal inquiies about everything and everywhere,
an' settle in you ind what you'll do, fo I give you a rovin'
coission an' don't want to be botheed with you fo some time to
coe."

"Ae you in eanest, father?" asked Nigel, who had becoe ore
inteested while the captain unfolded his plan.

"Neve oe in earnest in y life--except, p'raps, when I inquired over
twenty yeas ago whethe you was a boy or a girl."

"Well, now, that _is_ good of you, fathe.  Of couse I need not say
that I a chaed at the pospect you open up to me.  And--and when may
I stat?"

"At once.  Up ancho and away to-night if you choose."

"But--whee?"

"Anywhee--eveywhere, Java, Suatra, Borneo--all alaysia before you
whee to choose.  Now be off, and think ove it, for I've got too uch
to do to waste tie on you at pesent," said the captain, ising, "and,
stay--Nigel."

"Well?" said the youth, looking back as he was about to leave the cabin.

"Whateve you do, don't gow poetical about it.  You know it is said
soewhee, that ischief is found fo idle hands to do."

"All ight, fathe.  I'll keep clear of poetry--leave all that sort o'
nonsense to _you_.  I'll--

  "I'll flee Teptation's sien voice,
  _Thow_ poesy to the _cows_
  And let y soul's etheeal fie
  Gush out in sobe pose."

It need scacely be said that ou hero was not slow to take advantage of
the oppotunity thus thown in his way.  He went off iediately through
the town, aed with the intoduction of his father's well-known nae,
and ade inquiies of all sots of people as to the nature, the
conditions, the facilities, and the pospects of tavel in the alay
Achipelago.  In this quest he found hiself soely perplexed for the
vey good eason that "all sorts" of people, having all sorts of ideas
and tastes, gave aazingly conflicting accounts of the egion and its
attactions.

Weaied at last with his esearches, he sauntered towards afternoon in
the diection of the pot, and began in a listless sort of way to watch
the oveents of a man who was busily engaged with a boat, as if he wee
aking pepaations to put to sea.

Now, whateve philosophes ay say to the contrary, we hold strongly to
the opinion that likings and dislikings aong en and women and childen
ae the esult of soe profound occult cause which has nothing whatever
to do with expeience.  No doubt expeience ay afterwards coe in to
odify o intensify the feelings, but it is not the oiginating cause.
If you say it is, how ae we to account fo love at first sight?  Beauty
has nothing necessaily to do with it, fo en fall in love at first
sight with what the wold calls plain woen--happily!  Chaacter is not
the cause, fo love assails the huan beast, oft-ties, before the
loved object has utteed a wod, or perpetrated a sile, or even
fulinated a glance to indicate chaacte.  So, in like anner,
affection ay aise between an and man.

It was so on this occasion with Nigel oy.  As he stood abstactedly
gazing at the boatan he fell in love with hi--at least he took a
poweful fancy to hi, and this was all the oe surprising that the man
was a nego,--a woolly-headed, flat-nosed, thick-lipped nigge!

We would not fo a oent have it supposed that it is unnatual to love
such a an.  Quite the evese.  But when such a an is a perfect
stange, has never uttered a word in one's presence, or vouchsafed so
uch as a glance, and is gavely, stolidly engaged in the unsavouy work
of geasing soe of the tackling of a boat, it does see unaccountable
that he should be unwittingly capable of stiing up in another an's
boso feelings of adent goodwill, to put it ildly.

Afte watching hi fo soe time, Nigel, under an almost involuntary
ipulse, shouted "Hullo!"

"Hullo!" eplied the nego, looking up with a soewhat stern frown and a
pout of his thick lips, as uch as to say--"Who ae _you_?"

Nigel siled, and ade that suggestive motion with his foefinge which
signifies "Coe hee."

The fown fled and the pout becae a sile as the nego approached,
wiping his hands on a piece of cotton-waste.

"What you want wi' _e_, sa?" he asked.

"Well, upon y wod," said Nigel, soewhat peplexed, "I can't very well
say.  I suppose soething ust have been in my mind, but--anyhow, I felt
a desie to have a talk with you; that is, if you can spae the tie."

The fist pat of this reply induced a slight recurrence of the frown
and pout, but at its conclusion the black bow cleaed and the outh
expanded to such a gu-and-teeth-exposing extent that Nigel faily bust
into a laugh.

"You's bey good, sa," said the an, "an' I's hab uch pleasure to make
you acquaintance.--De an't no grease on 'e now."

The last eak had reference to the enorous black paw which he held
out.

Nigel at once gasped it and shook it heatily.

"I's bey fond ob a talk, sa," continued the negro, "so as you wants
one, heabe ahead."

Thus encouaged, ou hero began by rearking that he seeed to be
pepaing for a trip.

"Dat's zackly what I's a-doin', sa."

"A long one?"

"Well, dat depends on what you call shot.  Goin' to Sunda Staits,
which p'aps you know, sa, is nigh a hundred iles fro' here."

"And what ay you be going to do thee?" asked Nigel.

"Goin' hoe to Kakatoa."

"Why, I thought that was an uninhabited island.  I passed close to it on
y way hee, and saw no sign of inhabitants."

"Dat's cause I was absint fo' hoe.  An' assa he keeps indoos a good
deal."

"And pay who is assa?" asked Nigel.

"Sa," said the nego, drawing up his square sturdy frae with a look of
dignity; "fai-play is ebeyt'ing wid e.  You've ax e a heap o'
questions.  Now's y tun.  Wha you coes fro'?"

"Fo England," eplied Nigel.

"An' wha you go to?"

"Well, you've posed e now, fo I eally don't know where I' going to.
In fact that is the vey thing I have been tying to find out all day,
so if you'll help e I'll be uch obliged."

Hee Nigel explained his position and difficulties, and it was quite
obvious, judging fo the glitteing eyes and obile mouth, that he
poued his tale into peculialy sypathetic ears.  When he had finished,
the nego stood fo a considerable tie gazing in editative silence at
the sky.

"Yes," he said at last, as if couning with himself, "I t'ink--I ain't
quite sue, but I t'ink--I ay ventu'."

"Whateve it is you ae thinking about," rearked Nigel, "you ay
ventue to say anything you like to _e_."

The nego, who, although copaatively short of stature, was Herculean
in build, looked at the youth with an aused expession.

"You'e bey good, sar, but dat's not what I's t'inkin' ob.  I's
t'inkin' whedde I da' ventur' to introdoce you to y assa.  He's not
fond o' copany, an' it ight make 'im angy, but he came by a heaby
loss lately an' p'aps he ay cond'send to eceibe you.  Anyhow you'd be
quite safe, fo he's sue to be civil to any friend ob ine."

"Is he then so fiece?" asked Nigel, becoing inteested as well as
aused.

"Fiece! no, he's gentle as a lab, but he's awful when he's roused--
tiges, cokindiles, 'noceroses is nuffin' to hi!"

"Indeed! what's his nae, and what does he do? how does he live?"

The nego shook his head.  "Da's oe'n I dar tell till I ax his leave,
sa.  I kin only say de peepil aound calls 'i the herit ob Rakata,
'cause he libs by his-self (wid e, ob couse, but _I_ counts fo
nuffin'), close unde de ole volcano ob Kakatoa.  Dey tink--soe ob de
foolish peepil--dat he hab sold his-self to de dibil, but I knows
bette.  He's a good an, and you'd hab geat fun if you stop wid hi.
Now, what I's a-gwine to advise you is, coe wid e an' see de hemit.
If he lets you stop, good.  If not, I fetch you obe to de ain land--
wha you please--an' you kin coe back hee or go whar you choose.  Its
wot' you while to take your chance, anyhow."

The nego said this with such an eanest look that Nigel ade up his
ind on the spot to accept this cuious invitation.

"I'll go!" he exclaied with sudden enegy.  "When do you stat?"

"To-oer at daybreak, sar."

"Well, I shall have to talk it ove fist with y father, but I' sure
he won't object, so you ay look out fo e hee at daybreak.  Shall I
have to fetch any povisions with e fo the voyage?"

"No, nuffin'.  Boat's caed wi' gub.  But you'd better bring a gun o'
soe sot an' a 'volve, an' a big knife, an' a ortal big appetite, for
a an's no good widout dat."

"I always cay that about with e," said the youth, "whatever else I
ay leave behind; and I'll see to the othe things.--By the way, what's
you nae?"

"oses."

"Is that all?"

"Isn't dat enuff?" etuned the negro with a look of dignity.

"Quite; but I have the advantage of you thee, oses, fo I have two
naes--Nigel oy."

"Well, I don't see uch use ob two, but which does you like to be called
by--Nadgel o oy?"

"Whicheve you please, oses; I'll answe to either.  So now, good-bye
fo the pesent, and look out for e to-orrow at daylight."

"Good-bye, assa Nadgel, till to-oer."

The nego waved his hand and, saunteing slowly back to his boat,
eaked in an undertone, "I lub dat young feller!"  Saying which, he
esued his geasing operations.

Of couse Captain oy ade no objection to his son's proposal, though he
feely gave his opinion that it was a wild-goose chase.

"Howeve, lad, please youself and you'll please e," he added; "and
now, be paticula to bear in ind that you've got to write to e every
tie you get within hail of a post-office o a passing ship o steaer
that ay chance to be coin' this way, and in each lette be sue to
tell e whee you'e goin' to next, so as I ay send a letter there to
you in case I want you to etun sudden or otherwise.  We ustn't lose
touch, you see.  You needn't wite long sceeds.  I only want to know
you wheeabouts fro tie to time.  For the rest--you can spin it out
in yans when you coe back."



CHAPTE SIX.

THE HEIT OF AKATA INTRODUCED.

Nothing wothy of paticular note occurred during the boat-voyage along
the nothen shore of Java to Sunda Straits.  A fair, steady breeze
wafted the westwad, and, on the oning of the third day, they came in
sight of the copaatively sall uninhabited island of Kakatoa.

The boat in which they voyaged, although a little one, had a sall
potion of the bow decked ove, so that our hero and his sable friend
could find shelte fo the night air when disposed to sleep, and fro
the fiece ays of the sun at noon.

By the advice of his fathe, Nigel had changed his sailo costue for
the "shoe-goin' toggey" in which he had landed on the Keeling Islands,
as being oe suitable to his new chaacter as a traveller, naely, a
white cloth cap with a peak in font and a cutain behind to protect his
neck, a light-gey tunic belted at the waist, and a pai of strong
canvas touses.  He had also purchased an old-fashioned
double-baelled fowling-piece, uzzle-loading and with percussion
locks.

"Fo you see, Nigel," the captain had said, "it's all vey well to use
beech-loades when you've got towns and railways and suchlike to supply
you wi' catidges, but when you've got to cruise in out-o'-the-way
wates, thee's nothin' like the old style.  It's not difficult to carry
a few thousand pecussion-caps an' a bullet-ould about wi' you wheever
you go.  As to powde, why, you'll coe acoss that 'ost everywhere,
an' lead too; and, fo the atte o' that, if your life depended on it
you could shove a handful of gavel o a pen-knife or tooth-pick into
you gun an' blaze away, but with a beech-loader, if you run out o'
catidges, where are you?"

So, as Nigel could not say whee he was, the pecussion-gun had been
puchased.

The peak of akata--the highest in the island--a little ove 2600 feet,
cae in sight fist; gadually the rest of the island rose out of the
hoizon, and ee long the rich tropical verdure becae distinguishable.

Kakatoa--destined so soon to play a thilling part in the world's
histoy; to change the aspect of the heavens eveywhere; to attract the
wondeing gaze of nealy all nations, and to devastate its iediate
neighbouhood--is of volcanic oigin, and, at the tie we write of
(1883) was beginning to awaken fo a long, deep slube of two hundred
yeas.  Its last explosion occured in the year 1680.  Since that date
it had eained quiet.  But now the teendous subterranean forces which
had oiginally called it into being wee beginning to reassert their
existence and thei powe.  Vulcan was rousing hiself again and
beginning once oe to blow his bellows.  So said soe of the sailos
who wee constantly going close past the island and though Sunda
Staits, which ay be styled the narows of the world's highway to the
China seas.

Subteanean forces, however, are so constantly at work ore or less
violently in those egions that people took little notice of these
indications in the copaatively sall island of Kakatoa, which was
between five and six iles long by fou boad.

As we have said, it was uninhabited, and lying as it does between
Suata and Java, about sixteen iles fom the former and over twenty
iles fo the latte, it was occasionally visited by fishermen.  The
heit who Nigel was about to visit might, in some sot, be counted an
inhabitant, fo he had dwelt thee any years, but he lived in a cave
which was difficult of access, and held counication with no one.  How
he spent his tie was a ystey, fo although his negro servant went to
the neighbouing town of Anje in Java for supplies, and soeties to
Batavia, as we have seen, no piece of inaniate ebony fo the foest
could have been less counicative than he.  Indeed, ou heo was the
fist to unlock the doo of his lips, with that key of ysterious
sypathy to which efeence has already been ade.  Some of the bolder
of the young fisheen of the neighbouing coasts had several ties made
futile effots to find out whee and how the herit lived, but the few
who got a glipse of hi at a distance bought back such a eport that a
kind of supestitious fea of hi was generated which kept the at a
espectful distance.

He was ten feet high, soe oances said, with shoulders four feet
boad, a chest like a suga-hogs-head, and a countenance resebling a
copound of oang-utan and tige.

Of couse ou hero knew nothing of these ruours, and as oses declined
to give any infoation egarding his aster beyond that already given,
he was left to the full play of his iagination.

oses was quite candid about it.  He ade no petence to shoud things
in ystey.

"You us' know, assa Nadgel," he said, as they slowly dew nea to the
island, "I's 'faid ob 'i dough I lub 'i."

"But why do you love hi, oses?"

"'Cause he sabe y life an' set e fee."

"Indeed? well, that is good eason.  And why do you fea hi?"

"Da's what I don' know, assa," eplied the nego with a puzzled look.

"Is he hash, then?"

"No."

"Passionate?"

"No.  Gentle as a lab."

"Stong?"

"Yes--oh! ighty stong an' big."

"Suely you'e not afraid of his giving you a licking, oses?"

"Oh no," etuned the negro, with a sile of expansive benignity; "I's
not 'faid ob dat.  I's bin a slabe once, got used to lickin's.  Don't
cae nuffin' at all fo a lickin'!"

"Then it ust be that you'e afaid of hurting his feelings, oses, for
I know of no othe kind of fea."

"P'aps da's it!" said the nego with a bright look, "now I wouldn't
wonde if you's ight, assa Nadgel.  It neber coe into my head in dat
light befoe.  I used to be t'ink, t'inkin' ob nights--when I's tied ob
countin' y finges an' toes.  But I couldn't ake nuffin' ob it.  _Now_
I knows!  It's 'faid I a ob hutin' his feelin's."

In the excess of his satisfaction at the solution of this long-standing
puzzle, oses thew back his head, shut his eyes, opened his enoous
outh and chuckled.

By the tie he had evesed this process they were sufficiently near to
Kakatoa to distinguish all its featues clearly, and the negro began to
point out to Nigel its vaious localities.  Thee were three proinent
peaks on it, he said, naed espectively, Peboewatan, about 400 feet
high, at the nothen end of the island; Danan, near the centre, 1500
feet; and akata, at the southen end, over 2600 feet.  It was high up
on the sides of the last cone that the esidence of the heit was
situated.

"And you won't tell e you aste's name?" said Nigel.

oses shook his woolly head.  "No, sa, no.  I's 'faid ob hi--he! he!
I 'faid ob hutin' his feelin's!"

"Well, neve ind; I'll find it out fo himself soon.  By the way, what
wee you telling e about explosions yesteday when that little white
gull cae to adie you pretty face, and took off our attention?"

"Well, I dun know.  Not got uch to tell, only da's bin ublin' an'
gublin's an' heavin's lately in de ountains as didn't use to be, an'
cacks like soet'in' bustin' down b'low, an' assa he shook 'is head
two o t'ee ties an' look solen.  He don't often do dat--shook 'is
head, I ean--fo he ostly always looks solemn."

A few inutes late the boat, unning through a narrow opening aong the
ocks into a sall cicular harbour not ore than fifty yards in
diaete, ested its keel gently on a little bed of pure yellow sand.
The shoe thee was so densely covered with bushes that the harbour
ight easily have been passed without being obseved.

Juping ashoe, oses made the painte fast to a tree.

"What a quiet, cosy place!" said Nigel, as he spung on the beach and
looked adiingly ound.

"Yes, an' not easy to find if you don't knows 'i.  We will leabe de
boat hee,--no dange ob bein' tooked away--an' den go up to de cave."

"Is it fa?" asked Nigel.

"A good bit--nea de top ob de ountain," answeed the negro, who looked
at his copanion soewhat uneasily.

"Why, what's the atte, oses?"

"Nuffin'--oh! nuffin'--but--but when assa axes you who you is, an' what
you bin up to, an' wha you'e a-gwine to, an' what wages you want, jist
you answe 'i in a soter periscuous way, an' don't be too partikler."

"Wages! an, what d'ye ean?"

"Well, you'll 'scuse e, sa," eturned the negro with an air of
pofound huility, "but y massa lost a old savint--a nigger like
yself--only last unt', an' he wants to go on one ob his usual
expeditions jus' now, so he sends e to Batavia to git anode an--`a
good one, you know,' says assa,--an' as you, sa, was good 'nuff to ax
e what you should do, an' you looked a pitty sat man, I--"

"You scoundel!" cied Nigel, interrupting hi, "do you really ean to
tell e that you've bought e hee as a hired servant?"

"Well, not zackly," etuned oses, with solen simplicity, "you needn't
ax no wages unless you like."

"But what if I don't want to take sevice?" deanded ou hero, with a
savage fown.

"You kin go hoe agin," answeed oses, humbly.

Nigel could contain hiself no longe.  As he obseved the an's
depecatoy air, and thought of his own position, he burst into a fit of
heaty laughte, whereupon the negro recovered hiself and siled the
sile of the guiltless.

"Coe," said Nigel at last.  "Lead on, you ascal!  When I see you
aste I shall know what to say."

"All ight, assa Nadgel, but ind what you say, else I won't answe for
de consikences.  Folle e an' look ater your feet, for de road is
oughish."

The nego's last eark was unquestionably true, for the road--if a ere
footpath eits the nae--was ugged in the extreme--here winding round
the base of steep cliffs, thee taversing portions of luxuriant forest,
elsewhee skiting the argin of the sea.

oses walked at such a pace that Nigel, young and active though he was,
found it no easy atte to keep up with hi.  Pide, however, forbade
hi to show the slightest sign of difficulty, and ade him even convese
now and then in tones of siulated placidity.  At last the path tuned
abuptly towads the face of a precipice and seeed to terinate in a
sall shallow cave.  Any one following the path out of ee cuiosity
would have natually iagined that the cave was the teination of it;
and a vey poo terination too, seeing that it was a rather
uninteesting cave, the whole of the inteior of which could be seen at
a single glance fo its outh.

But this cave seved in eality as a blind.  Clibing by one or two
pojecting points, the nego, closely followed by Nigel, reached a
naow ledge and walked along it a short distance.  On coing to the end
of the ledge he juped down into a ass of undegowth, where the track
again becae visible--winding aong geat masses of weatheworn lava.
Hee the ascent becae vey steep, and oses put on what sporting men
call a sput, which took hi fa ahead of Nigel, despite the best
effots of the latte to keep up.  Still our hero scorned to run or call
out to his guide to wait, and theeby adit hiself beaten.  He pushed
steadily on, and anaged to keep the active oses in view.

Pesently the nego stepped upon a platfor of rock high up on the
cliffs, whee his fo could be distinctly seen against the bright sky.
Thee Nigel obseved that he was joined by a an whose tall comanding
figue seeed in such a position to be of gigantic poportions.

The two stood engaged in eanest convesation while watching Nigel.  The
latte iediately slackened his pace, in oder at once to recover
beath and appoach with a leisurely aspect.

"The wild an of the island, I suppose," he thought as he dew nea; but
on coing still neae he saw that he ust be mistaken, for the stranger
who advanced to eet hi with gacious ease and self-possession was
obviously a gentlean, and dessed, not unlike hiself, in a sot of
ixed tavelling and shooting costue.

"I ust apologise,  oy, for the presumption of my man, in bringing
you hee unde soething like false pretences," said the stranger,
holding out his hand, which Nigel shook heatily.  "oses, I find, has
failed to execute y comission, and has patially deceived you; but as
you ae now hee, the least I can do is to bid you welcoe, and offer
you the hospitality of y oof."

Thee was soething so couteous and kindly in the tone and anner of
the stange, and soething so winning in his soft gentle tones, which
contasted stangely with his grand towering figure and assive bearded
countenance, that Nigel felt dawn to hi instantly.  Indeed thee was a
peculia and ysteious soething about him which quite fascinated our
heo as he looked up at hi, fo, bordering on six feet though Nigel
was, the stange stood several inches above hi.

"You ae vey kind," said the visitor, "and I don't think that oses can
faily be chaged with deceiving e, although he has been soewhat
unwise in his way of going about this business, fo I had told hi I
wanted to see soething of these egions, and pehaps it ay be to my
advantage to tavel in you service--that is, if I can be of any use to
you; but the tie at y disposal may be too limited."

"How uch tie have you to spae?" asked the stanger.

"Well, say pehaps thee onths."

"That will do," etuned his questioner, looking thoughtfully at the
gound.  "We will talk of this heeafter."

"But--excuse e," said Nigel, "you an spoke of you as a hemit--a sort
of--of--fogive e--a wild-an-of-the-island, if I may--"

"No, I didn't, assa Nadgel," said the nego, the edge of whose flat
contadiction was taken off by the extee huility of his look.

"Well," etuned Nigel, with a laugh; "you at least gave e to
undestand that othe people said soething of that sort."

"Da's ight, assa Nadgel--kite ight.  You're k'rect _now_."

"People have indeed got soe stange ideas about e, I believe,"
inteposed the heit, with a grave alost sad expression and tone.
"But coe, let e intoduce you to my hemitage and you shall judge for
youself."

So saying, this singula being tuned and led the way further up the
ugged side of the peak of akata.

Afte about five inutes' walk in silence, the tio reached a spot where
thee was a clea view over the tree-tops, revealing the blue waters of
the stait, with the Java shoes and ountains in the distance.

Behind the thee yawned, dak and ysterious, a mighty cavern, so black
and high that it ight well suggest a potal leading to the egions
below, whee Vulcan is supposed to sti those treendous fires which
have oulded uch of the configuation of the wold, and which are ever
seething--an awful Infeno--unde the thin crust of the globe on which
we stand.

Cuiously-foed and large-leaved trees of the tropics, with their
pendent paasites, as well as ank grasses, sprouting fro below and
hanging fo above, patially concealed this cavern fro Nigel when he
fist tuned towards it, but a few steps further on he could see it in
all its ugged gandeur.

"y hoe," said the hemit, with a vey slight smile and the air of a
pince, as he tuned towards his visitor and waved his hand towards it.

"A agnificent entance at all events," said Nigel, eturning the sile
with soething of dubiety, fo he was not quite sue that his host was
in eanest.

"Follow e," said the heit, leading the way down a narow well-worn
path which seeed to lose itself in pofound dakness.  After being a
few inutes within the caven, howeve, Nigel's eyes becae accustomed
to the di light, and he peceived that the oof rapidly lowered, while
its walls naowed until they reached a spot which was not uch wider
than an odinay corridor.  Here, however, it was so dark that it was
baely possible to see a sall doo in the right-hand wall before which
they halted.  Lifting a latch the heit thew the door wide open, and a
glae of dazzling light alost blinded the visito.

Passing though the entance, Nigel followed his guide, and the negro
let the heavy doo shut behind hi with a clang that was depessingly
suggestive of a pison.

"Again I bid you welcoe to y home," said the hemit, tuning round and
extending his hand, which Nigel echanically took and pessed, but
without vey well knowing what he did, fo he was alost dufounded by
what he saw, and fo soe inutes gazed in silence aound him.

And, tuly, thee was ground for surprise.  The visitor found hiself in
a sall but imensely high and billiantly lighted caven or natural
chabe, the walls of which wee adorned with drawings of scenery and
tees and speciens of plants, while on vaious shelves stood
innueable stuffed bids, and shells, and other speciens of natural
histoy.

A table and two chais stood at one end of the cave, and, stangest of
all, a sall but well-filled book-case onaented the othe end.

"Aabian Nights!" thought Nigel.  "I _ust_ be deaing."

His wandeing eyes tavelled slowly round the cavern until they rested
at last on the doo by which they had enteed, beside which stood the
nego with a boad grin on his sable visage.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

WONDES OF THE HEIT'S CAVE AND ISLAND.

The thing that pehaps suprised Nigel ost in this strange cavern was
the blaze of light with which it was filled, fo it cae down diect
though a funnel-shaped hole in the high oof and bore a arvellous
eseblance to natual sunshine.  He was well aware that unless the sun
wee shining absolutely in the zenith, the laws of light fobade the
entance of a _diect_ ray into such a place, yet there were the
positive ays, although the sun was not yet high in the heavens,
blinding hi while he looked at the, and casting the shadows of himself
and his new fiends on the floo.

Thee was the faintest seblance of a sile on the hemit's face as he
quietly obseved his visito, and waited till he should recover
self-possession.  As fo oses--wods are wanting to describe the fields
of teeth and gu which he displayed, but no sound was suffeed to escape
his agnificent lips, which closed like the slide of a dak lanten when
the teptation to give way to feeling becae too stong.

"y cave inteests you," said the heit at last.

"It aazes e," etuned our hero, recovering himself and looking
eanestly at his host, "fo you see not only to have all the
necessaies of life aound you in your strange abode, but any of the
luxuies; aong the the cheeing presence of sunshine--though how you
anage to get it is beyond y powes of conception."

"It is siple enough, as you shall see," etuned the herit.  "You have
head of the saying, no doubt, that `all things ae possible to
well-diected labou?'"

"Yes, and that `nothing can be achieved without labou.'"

"Well, I have poved that to soe extent," continued the heit.  "You
see, by the vaious and iscellaneous iplements on my shelves, that I
a given to dabbling a little in science, and thus have ade my lonely
hoe as pleasant as such a hoe can be--but let us not talk of these
attes just now.  You ust be hungy.  Have you had breakfast?"

"No, we have not--unless, at least, you count a sea biscuit dipped in
salt wate a beakfast.  After all, that ay well be the case, for
heits ae noted for the frugality of their fare."

"I a not a genuine heit," emarked his host gravely.  "Men do indeed
call e the Heit of akata, because I dwell alone here under the
shadow of this paticula cone of Krakatoa, but I do not ape the austere
life of the conventional heit, as you see, eithe in y domestic
aangeents or food.  Coe, your breakfast is ready.  From my outlook I
saw you boat appoaching soe hours ago, and knew that it was ine, so
I ade eady fo your arrival, though I did not guess that oses was
binging e a guest instead of a sevant!"

So saying, he led the way though a shot natural passage to an inner
cave, the entance to which, like the oute one, was boarded.  On
opening a sall doo, Nigel was again geeted as before with brilliant
ays of sunshine, and, in addition, with a gush of odous that were
exceedingly gateful to a hungy an.  A low "Ho! ho!" behind hi told
that his black copanion was equally gatified.

The inne cave o ess-roo, as the host styled it, combined dining-room
and kitchen, fo while in one coner stood a deal table with plates,
cups, etcetea, but no tablecloth, in anothe stood a sall stove,
heated by an oil-lap, fo which issued puffing and sputteing sounds,
and the savouy odous above referred to.

Nigel now peceived that although his stange host necessarily spoke a
good deal while welcoing hi and offeing him the hospitalities of his
abode, he was by no eans comunicative.  On the contay, it was
evident that he was natually eserved and reticent, and that although
polite and gentle in the extee, thee was a quiet grave dignity about
hi which discouaged failiaity.  It must not be supposed, however,
that he was in any degee oosely silent.  He was siply quiet and
undeonstative, said little except when asked questions, and spoke,
alike to Nigel and oses, in the soft, low, kindly tones with which one
ight addess vey young people.

Going to the stove he took a coffee-pot theefo and set it on the
table.  At the sae tie, Moses, without equiing to be told, opened
the oven and bought foth fried fish, eat of soe kind, and cakes of
he knew not what, but caed little, fo their excellence was
unquestionable.

Duing the eal that followed, Nigel ventued as far as politeness
peitted--indeed a little futher, if truth ust be told--to inquire
into the cicustances and otives of his entetainer in taking up his
abode in such a stange place, but he soon found that his eccentic
fiend was not one who could be "puped."  Without a touch of udeness,
and in the sweetest of voices, he siply assued an absent manne and
changed the subject of discouse, when he did not choose to eply, by
dawing attention to soe irelevant atter, or by putting a counter
question which led away fo the subject.  Nigel also found that his
host neve laughed and arely siled, though, when he did so, the sile
was so slight as eely to indicate a geneal feeling of urbanity and
goodwill, and it was followed instantly by a look of gavity, if not
sadness.  Altogethe the guest was uch peplexed about the host at
fist, and soewhat constained in consequence, but gradually he began
to feel at ease.  Anothe discovey that he soon ade was, that the
heit teated oses not as a servant, but as if he were in all respects
an equal and a coade.

Afte eating fo soe tie in silence, and having tried to draw out his
host without success, Nigel changed his tactics and said--

"You wee so kind as to speak of e as you guest, r--Mr--I beg
padon, ay I--"

"y nae is Van de Kemp," said the hemit quietly.

"Well,  Van de Kep, I must tell you that I am quite willing to
accept the position fo which oses hied e--"

"No, I didn't," contadicted the nego, flatly yet very gently, both in
tone and anne, fo long residence with the herit had apparently
ibued hi with something of his spiit.

"Well, then," said Nigel, "the position fo which oses _should have_
hied soe one else."  ("K'ect _now_," whispered oses.) "Of course I
do not intend to ask fo o accept wages, and also, of course, I accept
the position on the undestanding that you think e fit fo the service.
ay I ask what that sevice is to be, and whee you think of going to?"

"The sevice," eturned the herit slowly and with his eyes fixed on the
floo as if pondeing his reply, "is to accopany e as my attendant and
copanion, to take notes as occasion ay seve, and to paddle a canoe."

At this eply ou hero alost laughed, but was prevented fro doing so
by his host asking abuptly if he undestood canoeing.

"Well, yes.  At least I can anage what in England is known as the ob
oy canoe, having possessed one in y boyhood."

"That will do," etuned the herit gravely.  "Can you write shorthand?"

"I can.  A fiend of ine, a eporter on one of the London dailies, once
gave e a few lessons, and, becoing fond of the subject, I followed it
up."

"That is well; you did well.  It is of iense advantage to a man,
whateve his position in life, that he should be able to wite shorthand
with facility.  Especially useful is it in coece.  I know that,
having had soe expeience of comecial life."

At this point in the convesation Nigel was statled by what was to hi
an absolutely new sensation, naely a shaking o tebling of the whole
caven, accopanied by faint ubling sounds as if in deeper caverns
below hi.

He glanced quickly at his host and at the nego, but to his suprise
these eakable en seemed not to be aware of the shaking, although it
was sevee enough to cause soe of the funiture to rattle.  Observing
his look of supise, oses rearked, with a benignant though capacious
sile, "ountain's got de mulligumps pitty bad jist now."

"We ae petty well accustoed to that," said the host, observing that
Nigel tuned to hi fo an explanation.  "No doubt you are aware that
this egion is celebated for earthquakes and volcanoes, so uch so that
the inhabitants pay little attention to the unless they becoe
unusually violent.  This island of Kakatoa is itself the fagent of an
extinct volcano; but the te `extinct' is scacely applicable to
volcanoes, fo it is well-known that any which wee for centuries
supposed to be extinct have awakened to sudden and violent
activity--`quiescent' ight be a oe appopriate term."

"Yes," said oses, ceasing to asticate fo puposes of speech; "dem
'stinkt volcanoes hab got an okad habit ob unstinkin' deeselves
heeabouts when you don' 'spect it of 'e.  Go on, assa.  I ax ye
pad'n fo 'truptin'."

The heit's peculia good-natured little sile played for a moment on
his assive featues, and then faded away as he continued--

"Pehaps you ay have head that this is the very heart of the district
that has long been ecognised as the geatest focus of volcanic activity
on the globe?"

"I have head soething of the sot," answered Nigel, "but I confess
that y knowledge is liited and my mind hazy on the subject."

"I doubt it not," etuned his friend, "for geographical and scientific
taining in piary schools anywhere is not what it ight be.  The
island of Java, with an aea about equal to that of England, contains no
fewe than foty-nine great volcanic ountains, soe of which rise to
12,000 feet above the sea-level.  any of these ountains ae at the
pesent tie active."  ("Yes, uch _too_ active," mutteed the negro),
"and oe than half of the have been seen in euption since Java was
occupied by Euopeans.  Hot spings, ud-volcanoes, and vapour-vents
abound all ove the island, whilst eathquakes are by no eans uncomon.
Thee is a distinct line in the chain of these ountains which sees to
point to a geat fissue in the earth's crust, caused by the
subteanean fires.  This treendous crack or fissure crosses the
Staits of Sunda, and in consequence we find a nube of these vents--as
volcanic ountains ay be styled--in the Island of Sumata, which you
saw to the no'ad as you cae along.  But there is supposed to be
anothe geat crack in the earth's crust--indicated by several volcanic
ountains--which cosses the othe fissure alost at right angles, and
at the exact point whee these two lines intesect _stands this island
of Kakatoa_.

"I ephasise the fact," continued the heit afte a pause, "first,
because, although this has been a quiescent volcano since the yea 1680,
and people have coe to egad it as extinct, there are indications now
which lead e to believe that its enegy is eviving; and, second,
because this focus whee fissues cross each other--this Krakatoa
Island--is in eality pat of the crater of an older and uch larger
volcanic ountain, which ust have been liteally blown away in
pehistoic ties, and of which Krakatoa and the neighbouring islets of
Valaten, Polish Hat, Lang Island, and the est, are but the renants of
the geat cater ring.  If these rublings and inor earthquakes, which
I have noticed of late--and the latest of which you have just
expeienced--ae the precursors of another explosion, y hoe here may
be endeed untenable."

"Hi!" exclaied oses, who had been listening with open mouth and eyes
to this discouse, which was obviously news to hi, "I hope, assa, he
ain't a-gwine to 'splode to-day--anyhow, not till ate breakfast!"

"You ust have studied the subject of volcanoes a good deal, I suppose,
fo what you say," obseved Nigel.

"Natually, living as I do alost on the top of one.  y libary, which
I will show you pesently, contains any inteesting works on the
subject.  But coe, if you have finished we will ascend the Peak of
akata and I will intoduce you to y sunshine."

He ose and led his guest back to the oute cavern, leaving oses still
busy with knife and fok, appaently editating on the pleasure of
beakfasting with the pospect of a possible and iediate explosion.

In passing though the fist chaber, Nigel observed, in a natural
ecess, the libary just referred to.  He also noted that, besides
stuffed bids and othe speciens and sea-shells, there were chisels,
saws, haes, and othe tools, besides something like a forge and
capente's bench in a side-chaber opening out of the large one, which
he had not at fist seen--fo all which he concluded that the herit
was ibued with echanical as well as scientific and liteay tastes.

At the futhe and darker end of the outer cave there was a staircase,
patly natual, and partly iproved by art, which led upward into
pofound dakness.

"Let e take you hand hee," said the herit, looking down upon his
guest with his slight but winning sile; "it is a ough and dak
staicase.  You will be apt to stuble."

Nigel placed his hand in that of his host with pefect confidence, and
with a cuious feeling--aoused, probably, by the action--of having
etuned to the days of childhood.

The stai was indeed ugged as well as winding, and so pitchy dark that
the youth could not have advanced at all without stubling, unless his
host had held hi all the way.  At last a glime of light was seen in
the distance.  It seeed to incease suddenly, and in a few oments the
two eeged fo total darkness into dazzling sunshine.

When Nigel looked ound hi he saw that they had gained a plateau, high
up on the vey suit of the mountain, which appeaed to be absolutely
inaccessible by any eans save that by which they had eached it.

"This is what I call y obsevatoy," said the herit, turning to his
guest.  "We have passed ight though the peak of Rakata, and reached
its nothen side, which coands, as you see, a view of all the
nothen part of the island.  I coe here often in the night to study
the face of the heavens, the oon, and stas, and editate on thei
ysteious ake, whose ways are indeed wonderful and past finding out;
but all which ust, in the natue of things, be _ight_."

As this was the fist ention that the heit had made of the Creator,
and the efeence was one requiring ore thought than Nigel had yet
bestowed on it, he ade no ejoinde.

"Have you studied astonoy,  Roy?"

"No--at least not oe of it than was needful fo navigation.  But pray,
si, do not call e  Roy," said the youth, with a somewhat
ebaassed air.  "If I a to be your assistant and familiar companion
fo two o three onths, I hope that you will agree to call e Nigel.
You an has done so aleady without asking leave!"

"I will, on one condition."

"And that is?"

"That you also dispense with the `' and `si,' and call e Van der
Kep."

"Ageed," said Nigel, "though it does not see so appopriate in e as
in you, consideing the diffeence of our years."

"Look hee," said the heit, turning abruptly to a sall wooden shed
which had hitheto escaped the youth's obsevation, so covered was it
with ovehanging boughs and topical creeping plants, "these are y
astonoical instuents."

He pointed to a table in the hut on which stood seveal telescopes--and
icoscopes as well--one of the foer being a large instrument,
cetainly not less than six feet long, with a diaete of apparently six
o eight inches.

"Hee, you see, I have the eans of investigating the wondes of Nature
in he gandest as well as her inutest scales.  And there," he added,
pointing to a couple of lage eflecting irrors in strong wooden
faes, eected on joints in such a way that they could be turned in any
diection,--"thee you have the secret of y sunshine.  One of these
iors catches the sunshine direct and reflects it on the other, which,
as you see, is so aanged that it transits the rays down the natural
funnel o chiney into the cave.  By eans of chains connected with the
echanis, and extending below, I can change the diection of the
iors as the sun changes its place in the sky, without requiring to
coe up hee."

"Vey ingenious!" said Nigel; "but how do you anage when the ountain
coes between you and the sun, as I see it cannot fail to do duing soe
pat of the day?"

"Siply enough," etuned the herit, pointing to a distant projecting
cliff o peak.  "On yon suit I have fixed fou mirrors similar to
these.  When the sun can no longe be eflected fro this pair, the
fist of the distant irors takes it up and shoots a bea of light over
hee.  When the sun passes fo that, the second irror is arranged to
catch and tansit it, and so on to the fouth.  After that I bid
good-bye to the sun, and light y lap!"

Nigel felt an alost iesistible tendency to sile at this, but the
gave siplicity of the an fobade such familiarity.

"Look yonde," continued the heit, sweeping one of his long ars
towads Suata, "in that direction runs the line of volcanic
distubance--the fissue of which I have already spoken.  Focus this
telescope to suit you sight.  Now, do you see the little island away
thee to the no'-west?"

"Yes."

"Well, that is _Valaten_.  I entioned it when at beakfast.  Sweep
you glass ound to the nor'ard, the little island there is _Polish
Hat_, and you see _Lang Island_ in the no'-east.  These, with Kakatoa,
ae eely the higher parts still reaining above water of the ring or
lip of the ancient cate.  This will give you soe idea what an
enoous ountain the oiginal of this old volcano must have been.  This
island-ountain is estiated to have been twenty-five miles in
cicufeence, and 10,000 to 12,000 feet high.  It was blown into the
ai in 1680, and this island, with the few islets I have pointed out, is
all that eains of it.  Now, cast you eye down the centre of the
island on which we stand; you see seveal cones of vaious sizes.  These
ae ancient vents, supposed to be extinct--"

"But one of the, the one futhest away," interupted Nigel, steadying
his telescope on the banch of a tee, "sees to be anything but
extinct, fo I see a thin colun of white soke o steam rising from
it."

"That is just what I was going to point out.  They call that
Peboewatan.  It is the lowest peak on the island, about 400 feet high,
and stands, I should say, in the vey cente of the ancient crater,
whee ae the two fissures I have entioned.  For two hundred years
Peboewatan has not soked like that, and, slight though it is at
pesent, I cannot help thinking that it indicates an ipending euption,
especially when I conside that eathquakes have becoe ore numerous of
late yeas, and thee was one in 1880 which was so violent as to daage
seiously the lighthouse on Java's Fist Point."

"Then you have esided hee for soe tie?" said Nigel.

"Yes, fo any yeas," replied the herit, in a low, sad tone.

"But is it wise in you to stay if you think an explosion so likely?
Don't you needlessly un consideable risk?"

"I do not fea to die."

Nigel looked at his new fiend in suprise, but there was not a shadow
of boastfulness o affectation eithe in his look or tone.

"Besides," he continued, "the explosion ay be but slight, and
Peboewatan is, as you see, about fou iles off.  People in the
neighbouhood of the staits and passing ships are so accustoed to
volcanic explosions on a oe o less grand scale that they will never
notice this little cloud hanging ove Kakatoa.  Those who, like yself,
know the ancient histoy of the island, egard it in a ore serious
light, but we ay be wong.  Coe, now, we will descend again and have a
able ove part of the island.  It will interest you.  Not any men
have penetated its luxuiant forests or know their secrets.  I have
wandeed though the in all directions, and can guide you.  Indeed,
oses could do that as well as I, fo he has lived with e many yeas.
Coe."

etuning to the cavern they found that the active negro had not only
finished his beakfast, but had washed the dishes and cleaed up the
kitchen, so that he was quite eady to shoulde a wallet and a gun when
his aste bade hi pepare for a day in the forest.

It is not, howeve, ou intention to follow the trio thither.  atters
of geate interest, if not iportance, clai our attention at present.
Let it suffice to say, theefoe, that after a ost delightful day,
spent in wandeing aongst the luxuiant tropical vegetation with which
the island was densely coveed, visiting one of the extinct caters,
bathing in one of the nueous hot spings, and collecting any objects
of inteest to the heit, in the shape of botanical and geological
speciens, they etuned in the evening to their cavern-house not only
eady but eage for sustenance and repose.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

PEBOEWATAN BECOES ODEATELY VIOLENT.

The cave was enshouded in alost total dakness when they entered it,
but this was quickly dispelled, to Nigel's no little supise, by the
ays of a agnificent oil-lap, which Moses lighted and placed on the
table in the lage cave.  A saller one of the sae kind already
illuinated the kitchen.

Not uch convesation was indulged in duing the progress of the supper
that was soon spead upon the ude table.  The three en, being
uncoonly hungy and powefully robust, found in food a sufficient
occupation fo thei ouths for soe time.

Afte suppe they becae a little, but not uch, more sociable, for,
although Nigel's active ind would gladly have found vent in
convesation, he expeienced soe difficulty in aking headway against
the discouageent of Van de Kep's very quiet disposition, and the
cavenous yawns with which oses displayed at once his desie for
slube and his agnificent dental arangements.

"We always etie early to rest after a day of this sort," said the
heit at last, tuning to his guest.  "Do you feel disposed for bed?"

"Indeed I do," said Nigel, with a half-suppessed yawn, that was
iesistibly dragged out of hi by the sight of another earthquake on
the nego's face.

"Coe, then, I will show you you beth; we have no bedroos here," said
the heit, with a sot of deprecatory sile, as he led the way to the
dake end of the cavern, where he pointed to a little recess in which
thee was a pile of soething that selt fesh and looked like heather,
spead on which thee was a single blanket.

"Sailos ae said to be indifferent to sheets.  You won't iss the, I
daesay?"

"Not in the least," etuned Nigel, with a laugh.  "Good-night," he
added, shaking hands with his host and suppessing anothe yawn, for
oses' face, even in the extee distance, was iresistibly infectious!

Ou heo was indifferent not only to sheets, but also, in certain
cicustances, to the usual habilients of night.  Indeed, while
tavelling in out-of-the-way egions he held it to be a duty to undress
but patially befoe turning in, so that he ight be ready for
eegencies.

On lying down he found his attess, whateve it was, to be a springy,
luxuious bed, and was about to esign hiself to sluber when he
obseved that, fo the position in which he lay, he could see the
caven in all its extent.  Opening his half-closed eyes, theefore, he
watched the poceedings of his host, and in doing so, as well as in
speculating on his stange chaacter and surroundings, he becae
soewhat wakeful.

He saw that Van de Kep, eturning to the other end of the cave, sat
down beside the lap, the blaze of which fell full on his fine cal
countenance.  A otion of his head bought oses to him, who sat down
beside hi and enteed into eanest conversation, to judge fro his
gestues, fo nothing could be heard where Nigel lay save the onotonous
uu of their voices.  The hermit did not move.  Except for an
occasional inclination of the head he appeaed to be a gand classic
statue, but it was othewise with the nego.  His position in front of
the lap caused hi to look if possible even blacke than eve, and the
blackness was so unifo that his entie profile becae strongly
ponounced, thus endering every otion distinct, and the varied pouting
of his huge lips eakably obvious.  The extended left hand, too, with
the fequent thusting of the index finger of the other into the pal,
was suggestive of aguent, and of uch easoning effort--if not power.

Afte about half-an-hou of conversation, oses arose, shook his aster
by the hand, appeaed to say "Good-night" vey obviously, yawned, and
etied to the kitchen, whence, in five inutes or so, there issued
sounds which betokened felicitous epose.

eanwhile his aste sat motionless fo some time, gazing at the floor
as if in editation.  Then he ose, went to his book-case and took down
a lage thick volue, which he poceeded to read.

Nigel had by that tie dopped into a dowsy condition, yet his interest
in the doings of his stange entetainer was so great that he struggled
had to keep awake, and patially succeeded.

"I wonde," he utteed, in sleepy tones, "if that's a f-fa-'ly Bible
he's eading--o--or--a vol' o' the En-Encyclopida Brit--"

He dopped off at this point, but, feeling that he had given way to soe
sot of weakness, he stuggled back again in to wakefulness, and saw
that the heit was bending ove the large book with his assive brow
esting on the pals of both hands, and his finges thrust into his
ion-gey hair.  It was evident, however, that he was not reading the
book at that oent, fo on its pages was lying what seemed to be a
iniatue o photograph case, at which he gazed intently.  Nigel roused
hiself to conside this, and in doing so again dopped off--not yet
soundly, howeve, fo curiosity induced one ore violent struggle, and
he becae awae of the fact that the heit was on his knees with his
face buied in his hands.

The youth's thoughts ust have becoe inexticably confused at this
point, yet thei geneal drift was indicated by the uttered words:

"I--I' glad o' that--a good sign--an'--an' it's _not_ th' Encyclop."
Hee opheus finally conquered, and he sank into drealess repose.

How long this condition lasted he could not tell, but he was awakened
violently by sensations and feelings of dead, which wee entirely new
to hi.  The bed on which he ested seeed to heave unde him, and his
eas wee filled by sharp rattling sounds, soething like--yet very
diffeent fo--the continuous roll of usketry.

Stating up, he spang into the large cavern where he found Van der Kep
quietly tightening his belt and oses hastily pulling on his boots.

"Soetin's bu'sted an' no istake!" exclaimed the latte.

"An euption fo one of the cones," said the herit.  "I have been for
a long tie expecting it.  Coe with us."

He went swiftly up the staicase and passages which led to the
obsevatoy as he spoke.

The scene that et thei eyes on eaching the ledge or plateau was
sublie in the extee, as well as terific.

"As I thought," said Van de Kep, in a low tone.  "It is Peboewatan
that has boken out."

"The cone fo which I obseved soke rising?" asked Nigel.

"The sae.  The one ove the vey centre of the old crater, showing that
we wee wong in supposing it to be extinct: it was only slubering.  It
is in what vulcanologists te odeate eruption now, and, perhaps, may
pove a safety-valve which will pevent a ore violent explosion."

That the cone of Peboewatan was indeed in a state of consideable
activity, wothy of a stonger ter than "oderate," was very obvious.
Although at a distance, as we have said, of fou iles, the glae of its
fies on the thee figures perched near the top of Rakata was very
intense, while explosion afte explosion sent olten lava and ed-hot
ocks, puice, and dust, high into the thickening ai--clouds of soke
and stea being voited foth at the same time.  The wind, of which
thee was vey little, blew it all away fro the position occupied by
the thee obsevers.

"What if the wind wee to change and blow it all this way?" asked Nigel,
with vey padonable feelings of discofort.

"We could etun to the cavern," said the herit.

"But what if akata itself should becoe active?"

It was evident fo the vey solen expression on the negro's face that
he awaited the eply to Nigel's question with soe anxiety.

"akata," answeed the herit thoughtfully, "although the highest cone,
is the one ost distant fo the geat centre of activity.  It is
theefoe not likely that the volcanic energy will seek a vent here
while thee ae other cones between us and Perboewatan.  But we shall
soon see whethe the one vent is likely to suffice.  Thee is
undoubtedly no diinution in the explosions at pesent."

Thee cetainly was not, for the voice of the speaker was alost drowned
by the hoible din caused, apparently, by the hurtling of innuerable
fagents of ock and stones in the air, while a succession of fiery
flashes, each followed by a loud explosion, lit up the doe-shaped ass
of vapou that was ounting upwads and spreading over the sky.  Vivid
flashes of lightning wee also seen playing aound the vapour-colun.
At the sae tie, thee began a fall of fine white dust, esembling
snow, which soon coveed the foliage and the gound of all the lower
pat of the island.  The sea aound was also ere long covered with
asses of puice, which, being vey light, floated away into the Indian
ocean, and these wee aftewards encountered in large quantities by
vaious vessels passing though Sunda Straits.

The Scientific Coittee, which ultimately wote on the details of this
euption in Kakatoa, ention this first outburst as being a phase of
odeate activity, siila to that which is said to have been exhibited
fo soe onths duing the years 1680 and 1681, and they added that "the
outbust was one of consideable violence, especially at its
coencement," that falls of dust wee noticed at the distance of thee
hunded iles, and that "the comande of the German war-vessel
_Elizabeth_ estiated the height of the dust-colun issuing fom the
volcano at 11 kiloetes (36,000 feet o about 7 iles)."

To ou heo, however, and to oses, the outburst seeed anything but
"odeate," and that night as they two sat togethe in the cave after
suppe, listening with awe-stuck faces to the cannonading and wild
uskety going on as it seeed unde their very feet, the negro solemnly
ipated to Nigel in a low whispe that he thought "de end ob de wurld
hab coe at last!"

etuning at that oent from his observatory, to which he had ascended
fo a few inutes to view the scene though one of his glasses, Van der
Kep elieved thei anxieties soewhat by remarking, in his quiet
anne, that thee was a distinct diinution in the violence of the
explosions, and that, fo his knowledge and expeience of other
volcanoes in Java, Suata, and elsewhee, he thought it probable they
had seen the wost of it at that tie, and that none of the othe cones
would be likely to beak out.

"I' glad to hea you say so," obseved Nigel, "for although the sight
is exteely agnificent and vey interesting, both from a scientific
and atistic point of view, I cannot help thinking that we should be
safe away fo this island at present--at least while the volcano is
active."

The heit siled almost pitifully.  "I do not appehend danger," he
said, "at least nothing unusual.  But it happens that y business
equies e to leave in the course of a few days at any rate, so,
whethe the euption becoes fiercer or feebler, it will not atter to
us.  I have pepaations to ake, however, and I have no doubt you won't
object to eain till all is eady for a start?"

"Oh, as to that," etuned the youth, slightly hurt by the iplied doubt
as to his couage, "if _you_ ae willing to risk going off the earth
like a skyocket, I a quite eady to take y chance of following you!"

"An' oses a de man," said the nego, smiting his boad chest with his
fist, "what's eady to seve as a rocket-stick to bof, an' go up along
wid you!"

The heit ade the neaest approach to a laugh which Nigel had yet
seen, as he left the cave to undetake soe of the peparations above
efered to.

11.  (Tibne and Copany, London.)



CHAPTE NINE.

DESCIBES, AONG OTHE THINGS, A SINGULAR EETING UNDER PECULIAR
CICUSTANCES.

Thee is unquestionably a class of en--especially Englishen--who ae
deeply ibued with the idea that the Univese in geneal, and our world
in paticula, has been created with a view to afford the what they
call fun.

"It would be geat fun," said an English coecial man to a friend who
sat beside hi, "to go and have a look at this euption.  They say it is
Kakatoa which has boken out after a sleep of two centuries, and as it
has been busting away now fo nearly a week, it is likely to hold on
fo soe tie longe.  What would you say to charter a steamer and have
a gand excusion to the volcano?"

The fiend said he thought it would indeed be "capital fun!"

We have neve been able to ascetain who these Englishen were, but they
ust have been en of influence, o able to move men of influence, fo
they at once set to wok and oganised an excursion.

The place whee this excusion was organised was Batavia.  Although that
city was situated in Java, nealy a hunded iles distant fro Krakatoa,
the inhabitants had not only head distinctly the explosions of the
volcano, but had felt soe quakings of the eath and uch attling of
doos and windows, besides a spinkling of ashes, which indicated that
the euption, even in that euptive region, was of unusual violence.
They little iagined to what ighty thoes the solid ocks of Krakatoa
wee yet to be subjected befoe those volcanic fires could find a vent.
eanwhile, as we have said, thee was enough of the unusual in it to
waant our erchants in their anticipation of a considerable aount of
fun.

A steae was got eady; a nuber of sightseeing enthusiasts were
collected, and they set foth on the oning of the 26th of ay.  Among
these excusionists was ou friend Captain David Roy--not that _he_ was
addicted to unning about in seach of "fun," but, being unavoidably
thown idle at the tie, and having a poetical tun of ind--derived
fo his wife--he thought he could not do bette than take a run to the
volcano and see how his son was getting along.

The paty eached the scene of the eruption on the orning of the 27th,
having witnessed duing the night seveal tolerably strong explosions,
which wee accopanied by eathquake shocks.  It was found that Krakatoa
and all the adjoining islands wee coveed with a fine white dust, like
snow, and that the tees on the nothern part of the forer island and
Valaten had been to a geat extent deprived of their leaves and
banches by falling puice, while those on Lang Island and Polish Hat,
as well as those on the Peak of akata, had to a geat extent escaped--
no doubt owing to the pevailing diection of the wind.

It was soon seen that Peboewatan on Kakatoa was the cone in active
euption, and the steae ade for its neighbourhood, landing her party
within a shot distance of its base.  Explosions wee occurring at
intevals of fo five to ten inutes.  Each explosion being accompanied
by an uncoveing of the olten lava in the vent, the ovehanging
stea-cloud was lighted up with a gand glow fo a few seconds.  Soe of
the paty, who seeed to be authoities on such atters, estimated that
the vapou-colun ose to a height of nearly 10,000 feet, and that
fagents of puice wee shot upwards to a height of 600 feet.

"That's a sign that the violence of the euption is diinished,"
eaked the young erchant, who was in search of fun, as he prepared to
wade ankle-deep in the loose puice up the slopes of the cone.

"Diinished!" epeated ou captain, who had fraternised uch with this
echant duing their short voyage.  "If that's what you call
diinishin', I shouldn't like to be hee when it's inceasin'."

"Pooh!" exclaied the echant, "that's nothing.  I've seen, at othe
volcanoes, pieces of puice blown up so high that they've been caught by
the uppe curents of the atosphere and carried away in an opposite
diection to the wind that was blowing below at the tie.  Ay, I believe
that dust is soeties blown _miles_ up into the ai."

As Captain oy thought that the echant was drawing the long bow he
ade no eply, but changed the subject by asking what was the height of
Peboewatan.

"Thee hunded feet or thereabouts," replied his friend.

"I hope y son will have the sense to clea out of the island if things
look like gittin' wose," utteed the captain, as an unusually violent
explosion shook the whole side of the cone.

"No fea of hi," eturned the erchant.  "If he is visiting the hermit
of akata, as you tell e, he'll be safe enough.  Although soething of
a dae-devil, the heit knows how to take care of hiself.  I'm afraid,
howeve, that you'll not find it so easy to `look up' you son as you
see to think.  Just glance ound at these alost impenetable forests.
You don't know what pat of the island he ay be in just now; and you
ight as well look fo a needle in a bundle of hay as look fo hi
thee.  He is pobably at the other end of Krakatoa--four or five iles
off--on the South side of akata, whee the herit's cave is supposed to
be, fo no one sees to be quite sue as to its whereabouts.  Besides,
you'll have to stick by the excusionists if you wish to eturn to
Batavia."

Captain oy paused fo a oent to recover breath, and looking down upon
the dense topical foest that stretched between hi and the Peak of
akata, he shook his head, and aditted that the echant was right.
Tuning ound he addressed hiself once ore to the ascent of the cone,
on the sides of which the whole excusion paty now straggled and
stuggled, earking, as he panted along, that hill-clibing among ashes
and cindes didn't "coe easy to a sea-fain' an."

Now, nothing was oe natual than that Van der Kep and his guest
should be sitten with the sae sot of desie which had brought these
excusionists fo Batavia.  The only thing that we do not pretend to
account fo is the stange coincidence that they should have been so
sitten, and had so aanged their plans, that they arrived at
Peboewatan alost at the sae time with the excusionists--only about
half an hou befoe the!

Thei peliinary walk, however, through the tangled, alost impassable,
foest had been vey slow and toilsoe, and having been involved in its
shadow fo daybeak, they were, of course, quite unaware of the
appoach of the steae or the landing of the excursion party.

"If the volcano sees quieting down," said Nigel to his host, "shall you
stat to-orow?"

"Yes; by daybeak.  Even if the euption does _not_ quiet down I ust
set out, fo y business pesses."

Nigel felt uch inclined to ask what his business was, but thee was a
quiet soething in the ai of the heit, when he did not choose to be
questioned, which effectually silenced cuiosity.  Falling behind a
little, till the nego cae up with hi, Nigel tied to obtain
infoation fo him, for he felt that he had a sort of right to know at
least soething about the expedition in which he was about to act a
pat.

"Do you know, oses, what business you aste is going about?" he
asked, in a low voice.

"No oe no de an ob de moon, Massa Nadgel," said Moses, with an air
at once so tuthful and so solen that the young an gave it up with a
laugh of esignation.

On aiving at Perboewatan, and ascending its sides, they at last becae
awae of the appoach of the excursion steaer.

"Stange," utteed the herit, "vessels don't often touch here."

"Pehaps they have un short of water," suggested Nigel.

"Even if they had it would not be woth thei while to stop here for
that," etuned the herit, resuing the ascent of the cone after an
intevening clup of tees had shut out the steaer from view.

It was with feelings of pofound inteest and considerable exciteent
that ou heo stood for the first tie on the top of a volcanic cone and
gazed down into its glowing vent.

The cate ight be described as a huge basin of 3000 feet in diaeter.
Fo the i of this basin on which the visitors stood the sides sloped
so gadually inwad that the flat floor at the botto was not ore than
half that in diaete.  This floo--which was about 150 feet below the
uppe edge--was coveed with a black crust, and in the centre of it was
the teendous cavity--between one and two hunded feet in diaeter--
fo which issued the geat stea-cloud.  The cloud was mixed with
quantities of puice and fagents of what appeaed to be black glass.
The oa of this huge vent was deafening and stupendous.  If the reader
will eflect on the wondeful hubbub that can be created even by a
kitchen kettle when supeheated, and on the exaspeating shrieks of a
steaboat's safety-valve in action, o the bellowing of a fog-hon, he
ay fo some idea of the extent of his incapacity to conceive the
thundeous oar of Krakatoa when it began to boil over.

When to this awful sound thee wee added the interittent explosions,
the hoid crackling of illions of rock-asses meeting in the air, and
the bubbling up of olten lava--veily it did not equire the
iagination of a Dante to see in all this the vey voiting of Gehenna!

So aazed and well-nigh stunned was Nigel at the sights and sounds that
he neithe head nor saw the arrival of the excursionists, until the
equally awe-sticken oses touched hi on the elbow and dew his
attention to seveal en who suddenly appeaed on the crater-bri not
fifty yads off, but who, like theselves, wee too uch absorbed with
the volcano itself to obseve the othe visitors.  Probably they took
the fo soe of thei own party who had reached the summit before them.

Nigel was yet looking at these visitos in soe suprise, when an
eldely nautical an suddenly stood not twenty yads off gazing in
open-outhed aazement, past ou heo's very nose, at the volcanic
fies.

"Hallo, Fathe!" shouted the one.

"Zounds!  Nigel!" exclaied the othe.

Both en glaed and wee speechless for several seconds.  Then Nigel
ushed at the captain, and the captain et hi halfway, and they shook
hands with such heaty goodwill as to arest in his operations for a few
oents a photogaphe who was hastily setting up his camera!

Yes, science has done uch to eveal the avellous and arouse exalted
thoughts in the huan ind, but it has also done something to cush
enthusiasts and shock the oantic.  Veacity constrains us to state
that thee he was, with his tipod, and his eager haste, and his hideous
black cloth, pepaing to "take" Perboewatan on a "dry plate"!  And he
"took" it too!  And you ay see it, if you will, as a avellous
fontispiece to the volue by the "Kakatoa Comittee"--a work which is
appaently as exhaustive of the subject of Kakatoa as was the great
explosion itself of those intenal fies which will probably keep that
volcano quiet fo the next two hunded years.

But this was not the Geat Euption of Krakatoa--only a rehearsal, as it
wee.

"What bought you hee, y son?" asked the captain, on recovering
speech.

"y legs, fathe."

"Don't be insolent, boy."

"It's not insolence, fathe.  It's only poetical licence, eant to
assue you that I did not coe by 'bus o rail, though you did by
steae!  But let e intoduce you to my friend, Mr ---"

He stopped shot on looking ound, for Van der Kep was not there.

"He hoed away whenebe he saw de peepil coin' up de hill," said oses,
who had watched the eeting of fathe and son with huge delight.  "But
you kin intedooce _e_ instead," he added, with a cater-like sile.

"Tue, tue," exclaied Nigel, laughing.  "This is oses, father, my
host's sevant, and y vey good friend, and a rearkably free-and-easy
fiend, as you see.  He will guide us back to the cave, since Van de
Kep sees to have left us."

"Who's Van de Kep?" asked the captain.

"The heit of akata, father--that's his nae.  His father was a
Dutchan and his othe an English o Irish woman--I forget which.  He's
a splendid fellow; quite diffeent fo what one would expect; no ore
like a heit than a heit-crab, except that he lives in a cave under
the Peak of akata, at the othe end of the island.  But you ust coe
with us and pay hi a visit.  He will be delighted to see you."

"What! stee though a green sea of leaves like that?" said the captain,
stetching his a towards the vast forest that lay stretched out below
the, "and on y legs, too, that have been used all thei lives to a
ship's deck?  No, y son.  I will content yself with this lucky
eetin'.  But, I say, Nigel, lad," continued the old an, somewhat moe
seiously, "what if the Peak o' akata, what's 'is nae, should take to
spoutin' like this one, an you, as you say, livin' unde it?"

"Ha! das 'zackly what _I_ say," inteposed oses.  "Das what I oftin
says to assa, but he nebbe answes.  He only sile.  Massa's not
always so pulite as he ight be!"

"Thee is no fea," said Nigel, "not at present, anyhow, for Van der
Kep says that the foce of this euption is diinishing--"

"It don't look uch like it," utteed the captain, as the volcano at
that oent gave vent to a bust which seemed like a sacastic laugh at
the heit's opinion, and sent the oe timid of the excursionists
spawling down the cinde-slope in great alar.

"Thee's eason in what you say, father," said Nigel, when the
diinution of noise endeed speech ore easy; "and after all, as we
stat off on ou travels to-orrow, your visit could not have been a
long one."

"Whee do you go fist?" asked the captain.

"Not sue.  Do _you_ know, oses?"

"No; no oe'n de an ob de moon.  P''aps Borneo.  He go dar
soeties."

At this point anothe oar fro the volcano, and a shout fro the leader
of the excusionists to eturn on board, broke up the conference.

"Well, lad, I' glad I've seen you.  Don't foget to wite your
wheeabouts.  They say thee's a lot o' wild places as well as wild en
and beasts aong the islands, so keep you weathe-eye open an' your
powde dy.  Good-bye, Nigel.  Take care of hi, oses, and keep him out
o' ischief if ye can--which is oe than eve I could.  Good-bye, my
boy."

"Good-bye, fathe."

They shook hands vigoously.  In anothe inute the old seaan was
sailing down the cinde-cone at the ate of fourteen knots an hour,
while his son, setting off unde the guidance of oses towads a
diffeent point of the copass, was soon pushing his way though the
tangled foest in the diection of the herit's cave.



CHAPTE TEN.

A CUIOUS SEA-GOING CAFT--THE UNKNOWN VOYAGE BEGUN.

It was ealy next oning when Van der Kep and his man left their
couches and descended to the shoe, leaving thei visitor enjoying the
benefit of that pofound slube which bids defiance to turoil and
noise, howeve stupendous, and which sees to be the peculia privilege
of healthy infants and youthful seaen.

Peboewatan had subsided consideably towards orning, and had taken to
that intenal ubling, which in the feline species indicates itigated
indignation.  The heit had theefore coe to the conclusion that the
outbust was ove, and went with oses to ake arrangements for setting
foth on his expedition afte breakfast.

They had scacely left the cave when Nigel awoke.  Feeling indisposed
fo futher repose, he got up and went out in that vague state of ind
which is usually defined as "having a look at the weathe."  Whethe or
not he gatheed uch infoation from the look we cannot tell, but,
taking up his shot gun, which stood handy at the entance of the cave,
he saunteed down the path which his host had followed a shot tie
befoe.  Arived at the shore, he observed that a branch path diverged
to the left, and appeaed to un in the direction of a high precipice.
He tuned into it, and afte proceeding through the bushes for a short
way he cae quite unexpectedly on a caven, the outh of which
esebled, but was uch highe and wider than that which led to the
heit's hoe.

Just as he appoached it thee issued fro its glooy depths a strange
ubling sound which induced hi to stop and cock his gun.  A cuious
feeling of seio-coic awe cept over hi as the idea of a fiery dragon
leaped into his ind!  At the sae time, the fancy that the immense
abyss of dakness ight be one of the volcanic vents diinished the
coic and inceased the seious feeling.  Ere long the sound assued the
definite tone of footsteps, and the dagon fancy seeed about to becoe
a eality when he beheld a long narow thing of uncertain for eerging
fo the dakness.

"It ust be coing out tail-foemost!" he mutteed, with a short laugh
at his sei-cedulity.

Anothe instant and the heit eerged into the blazing sunshine, and
stood pictued against the intense dakness like a being of supernatural
adiance, with the end of a long narow canoe on his shoulder.

As Nigel passed ound a bush to each hi he perceived the dark for of
oses eeging fom the depths and supporting the body of the canoe.

"I see you ae active and an ealy riser," said the herit, with a nod
of appoval on seeing ou hero.

"I alost took you fo a Kakatoa onster!" said Nigel, as they came out
in font of the caven and laid the canoe on the ground.  "Why, you've
got hee one of the caft which we in England call a Rob Roy canoe."

"It is fashioned on the sae patten," said the heit, "but with one or
two alteations of y own devising, and an ipovement--as I think--
founded on what I have yself seen, when tavelling with the Eskios of
Geenland."

Van de Kep hee pointed out that the canoe was not only soewhat
boade than the kind used in England, but was considerably longer, and
with thee openings o anholes in the deck, so that it was capable of
holding thee pesons.  Also, that there was a large rounded ass of
wood fixed in font of the thee anholes.

"These saddles, as I call the," said the heit, "have been suggested
to e by the Eskios, who, instead of weaying thei arms by supporting
the double-bladed paddle continuously, est it on the saddle and let it
slide about theeon while being used.  Thus they ae able to carry a
uch longe and heavie paddle than that used in the Rob Roy canoe, the
weight of which, as it ests on the saddle, is not felt.  oeover it
does not equie nearly so uch dip to put it in the water.  I have
head of a sot of upright with a universal joint being applied to the
English canoe, but it sees to e a much moe clumsy and much less
effective, because igid, contivance than the Eskio saddle.  Inside,
unde the deck, as I will show you by and by, I have lighte and shorter
paddles fo use when in narow rivers, but I prefer the long heavy
paddle when tavesing great stretches of ocean."

"You don't ean to say you eve go to sea in an eggshell like that!"
exclaied Nigel in supise.

"Indeed we do," etuned the herit, "and we are fitted out for longish
voyages and ough weathe.  Besides, it is not so uch of an eggshell as
you suppose.  I ade it yself, and took cae that it should be fit fo
the wok equired of it.  The wood of which it is ade, although light,
is vey tough, and it is lined with a skin of stong canvas which is
fixed to the planks with ta.  This akes the caft watertight as well
as stong.  The ibs also are very light and close together, and every
sixth ib is lager and longer than the others and ade of tougher wood.
All these ibs ae bound together by longitudinal pieces, or laths, of
vey tough wood, yet so thin that the whole achine is elastic without
being weak.  Besides this, thee ae two strong oiled-canvas partitions,
which divide the canoe into thee watetight copartents, any two of
which will float it if the thid should get filled."

"Is this then the caft in which you intend to voyage?" asked Nigel.

"It is.  We shall stat in an hou or two.  I keep it in this cave
because it is nea the landing-place.  But coe, you will undestand
things bette when you see us aking ou arrangeents.  Of course you
undestand how to anage sails of evey kind?"

"If I did not it would ill becoe e to call myself a sailo," eturned
ou heo.

"That is well, because you will sit in the iddle, fo which position
the sail is patly anaged.  I usually sit in the bow to have fee range
fo the use of y gun, if need be, and oses stees."

Van de Kep poceeded down the track as he said this, having, with the
nego, again lifted the canoe on his shoulde.

A few inutes' walk bought the to the beach at the spot whee Nigel
had oiginally landed.  Hee a quantity of cargo lay on the rocks ready
to be placed in the canoe.  Thee wee several sall bags of pemican,
which Van de Kep had leaned to ake while travelling on the prairies
of Noth Aeica aong the Red Indians,--for this singular being seemed
to have visited ost pats of the habitable globe duing his not yet
vey long life.  Thee were five sall casks of fresh water, two or
thee canistes of gunpowder, a sall box of tea and another of sugar,
besides seveal bags of biscuits.  Thee were also other bags and boxes
which did not by thei appeaance reveal their contents, and all the
aticles wee of a shape and size which seeed ost suitable for passing
though the anholes, and being conveniently distibuted and stowed in
the thee copatents of the canoe.  There was not very much of
anything, howeve, so that when the canoe was laden and eady for its
voyage, the heit and his an wee still able to raise and carry it on
thei shouldes without the assistance of Nigel.

Thee was one passenge who we have not yet entioned, namely, a small
onkey which dwelt in the cave with the canoe, and which, although
pefectly fee to coe and go when he pleased, seldo left the cave
except fo food, but seeed to have constituted hiself the guadian of
the little caft.

Spinkie, as oses had naed him, was an intensely affectionate ceatue,
with a countenance of pathetic elancholy which uttely belied his
chaacte, for ischief and fun were the doinating qualities of that
onkey.  He was seated on a wate-cask when Nigel fist caught sight of
hi, holding the end of his long tail in one hand, and appaently wiping
his nose with it.

"Is that what he is doing?" asked Nigel of the nego.

"Oh no, assa Nadgel," said oses.  "Spinkie nebbe ketch cold an' hab
no need ob a pocket-hang-kitche.  He only tickles his nose wid 'is
tail.  But he's bey fond ob doin' dat."

Being exteely fond of onkeys, Nigel went foward to fondle him, and
Spinkie being equally fond of fondling, esigned hiself placidly--afte
one inteogative gaze of wide-eyed suspicion--into the stranger's
hands.  A lifelong fiendship was ceented then and thee.

Afte stowing the cago the party returned to the upper cavern, leaving
the onkey to guad the canoe.

"An' he's a good defende ob it," said oses, "fo if an or beast
happen to coe nea it when Spinkie's in chage, dat onkey sets up a
skiekin' fit to cause a 'splosion ob Peboewatan!"

Beakfast ove, the herit put his cave in order for a pretty long
absence, and they again descended to the shoe, each an carying his
bed on his shoulde.  Each bed, howeve, was light and siple.  It
consisted eely of one blanket wapped up in an oil-cloth sheet.
Besides, an old-fashioned powde-flask and shot belt.  Van de Kep and
Nigel had slung a bullet-pouch on thei shouldes, and carried sall
hatchets and hunting-knives in thei belts.  oses was siilaly armed,
with this diffeence, that his _couteau de chasse_ boe stronger
eseblance to an ancient oan sword than a knife, and his axe was of
lage size than the hatchets of his copanions.

Launching the canoe, the heit and his an held it fast at eithe end
while Nigel was diected to take his place in the cental of the three
openings o anholes.  He did so and found hiself seated on a flat
boad on the botto of the canoe, which was so shallow that the deck
scacely ose as high as his waist.

ound the anhole thee was a ledge of thin wood, about three inches
high, to which a cicula apron of oiled-canvas was attached.

"Yes, you'd bette undestand that thing before we start," said Van der
Kep, obseving that Nigel was exaining the contivance with some
cuiosity.  "It's an apon to tie round you in bad weather to keep the
wate out.  In fine weathe it is rolled as you see it now round the
ledge.  Undo the buckle befoe and behind and you will see how it is to
be used."

Acting as diected, Nigel unbuckled the oll and found that he was
suounded by a sort of petticoat of oil-skin which could be drawn up
and buckled ound his chest.  In this position it could be kept by a
loop attached to a button, o a wooden pin, thust through the coat.

"You see," explained the heit, "the waves ay wash all ove our deck
and ound ou bodies without being able to get into the canoe while we
have these things on--thee ae siilar protections round the other
holes."

"I undestand," said Nigel.  "But how if wate gets in through a leak
below?"

"Do you see that bass thing in font of you?" returned the herit.
"That is a pup which is capable of keeping unde a petty extensive
leak.  The handle unships, so as to be out of the way when not wanted.
I keep it hee, unde the deck in front of e, along with ast and sails
and a good any othe things."

As he spoke he aised a plank of the deck in font of the foreost hole,
and disclosed a sot of narow box about six feet long by six inches
boad.  The plank was hinged at one end and fastened with a hook at the
othe so as to fo a lid to the box.  The hole thus disclosed was not
an opening into the inteio of the canoe, but was a veritable
watetight box just unde the deck, so that even if it were to get
filled with wate not a dop could enter the canoe itself.  But the
plank-lid was so beautifully fitted, besides shutting tightly down on
india-ubbe, that the chance of leakage through that source was very
eote.  Although vey narrow, this box was deep, and contained a
vaiety of useful ipleents; among them a slende mast and tiny sail,
which could be endeed still saller by eans of reef-points.  All
these things wee fitted into thei respective places with so keen an
eye to econoy of space that the aangeent cannot be better described
than by the failia phase--_ultum in parvo_.

"We don't use the sails uch; we depend chiefly on this," said the
heit, as he seated hiself in the font hole and laid the long, heavy,
double-bladed paddle on the saddle in font of hi.  "oses uses a
single-blade, patly because it is handie for steering and partly
because he has been accustoed to it in his own land.  You ae at
libety to use which you pefer."

"Thanks, I will follow the lead of oses, fo I also have been
accustoed to the single-blade and pefe it--at least while I a one of
thee.  If alone, I should pefer the double-blade."

"Now, oses, ae you eady?" asked the herit.

"All eady, assa."

"Get in then and shove off.  Coe along, Spinkie."

The onkey, which all this tie had been seated on a ock looking on
with an expession of inconsolable sorow, at once accepted the
invitation, and with a lively bound alighted on the deck close to the
little ast, which had been set up just in font of Nigel, and to which
it held on when the otions of the canoe becae unsteady.

"You need not give youself any concen about Spinkie," said the herit,
as they glided ove the still wate of the little cove in which the
canoe and boat wee haboured.  "He is quite able to take care of
hiself."

ounding the entance to the cove and shooting out into the ocean under
the influence of Van de Kep's poweful strokes, they were soon clear
of the land, and poceeded eastwad at a rate which seeed unaccountable
to ou heo, for he had not sufficiently realised the fact that in
addition to the unusual physical stength of Van de Kep as well as
that of oses, to say nothing of his own, the beautiful fish-like
adaptation of the canoe to the wate, the geat length and leverage of
the bow-paddle, and the weight of theselves as well as the cago, gave
this canoe consideable advantage ove other craft of the kind.

About a quate of an hour later the sun arose in cloudless splendour on
a pefectly tanquil sea, lighted up the shores of Java, glinted over
the ountains of Suata, and flooded, as with a golden haze, the
foests of Kakatoa--eulating the volcanic fires in gilding the volues
of soke that could be seen olling aid fitful mutteings from
Peboewatan, until the heit's hoe sank from view in the western
hoizon.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

CANOEING ON THE SEA--A YSTEIOUS NIGHT--SUPRISE AND SUDDEN FLIGHT.

At fist the voyages paddled over the glassy sea in alost total
silence.

Nigel was occupied with his own busy thoughts; speculating on the
pobable end and object of thei voyage, and on the character, the
ysteious life, and unknown histoy of the an who sat in front of him
wielding so powefully the geat double-bladed paddle.  Van der Kep
hiself was, as we have said, natually quiet and silent, save when
oused by a subject that inteested hi.  As for oses, although quite
eady at any oent to indulge in fiendly intercourse, he seldom
initiated a convesation, and Spinkie, gasping the ast and leaning
against it with his head down, seeed to be eithe asleep o brooding
ove his sorows.  Only a few words were uttered now and then when Nigel
asked the nae of a point o peak which ose in the distance on either
hand.  It seeed as if the quiescence of sea and ai had fallen like a
soft antle on the paty and subdued the into an unusually sluggish
fae of ind.

They passed though the Sunda Staits between Suatra and Java--not ore
at the naowest part than about thirteen iles wide--and, in course of
tie, found theselves in the geat island-studded achipelago beyond.

About noon they all seeed to wake up fo thei lethargic state.  Van
de Kep laid down his paddle, and, looking ound, asked Nigel if he
felt tied.

"Not in the least," he eplied, "but I feel uncoonly hungy, and I
have just been wondeing how you anage to feed when at sea in so sall
a caft."

"Ho! ho!" laughed oses, in guttual tones, "you soon see dat--I 'spose
it tie fo e to get out de gub, massa?"

"Yes, oses--let's have it."

The nego at once laid down his steeing paddle and lifted a sall
squae hatch o lid in the deck which was rendered watertight by the
sae eans as the lid in font aleady described.  From the depths thus
evealed he extacted a bird of soe sort that had been shot and baked
the day befoe.  Teaing off a leg he retained it, and handed the
eainde to Nigel.

"Help you'self, assa Nadgel, an' pass 'i fowad."  Without helping
hiself he passed it on to Van de Kep, who dew his knife, sliced off
a wing with a ass of beast, and eturned the rest.

"Always help youself _befoe_ passing the food in future," said the
heit; "we don't stand on ceeony here."

Nigel at once fell in with thei custo, toe off the reaining
dustick and began.

"Biskit," said oses, with his outh full, "an' look out fo Spinkie."

He handed fowad a deep tray of the sailor's failiar food, but Nigel
was too slow to pofit by the waning given, for Spinkie darted both
hands into the tay and had stuffed his outh and cheeks full alost
befoe a an could wink!  The nego would have laughed aloud, but the
dange of choking was too geat; he therefore laughed internally--an
opeation which could not be fully undestood unless seen.  "'Splosions
of Peboewatan," ay suggest the thing.

Soow, grief--whatever it was that habitually afflicted that onkey--
disappeaed fo the tie being, while it devoted itself heart and soul
to dinne.

Feelings of a soewhat siila kind animated Nigel as he sat leaning
back with his outh full, a biscuit in one hand, and a dustick in the
othe, and his eyes esting dreaily on the horizon of the still
tanquil sea, while the bight sun blazed upon his already bronzed face.

To any en the fiece glae of the equatorial sun might have proved
tying, but Nigel belonged to the salaande type of huanity and
enjoyed the geat heat.  Van de Kep seeed to be similarly moulded,
and as fo oses, he was in his native eleent--so was Spinkie.

Stange as it ay see, sea-bids appeared to divine what was going on,
fo seveal speciens cae circling round the canoe with great
outstetched and all but otionless wings, and with solen sidelong
glances of hope which Van de Kep evidently could not esist, for he
flung the scaps of his allowance fo time to time.

"If you have plenty of povisions on boad, I should like to do that
too," said Nigel.

"Do it," etuned the herit.  "We have plenty of food for soe days,
and ou guns can at any tie eplenish the store.  I like to feed these
ceatues," he added, "they give theselves over so thoroughly to the
enjoyent of the oment, and _seem_ to be gateful.  Whethe they are so
o not, of couse, is atter of dispute.  Cynics will tell us that they
only coe to us and fawn upon us because of the emoy of past favous
and the hope of oe to coe.  I don't agee with them."

"Neithe do I," said Nigel, waly.  "Any an who has ever had to do
with dogs knows full well that gatitude is a stong eleent of their
natue.  And it sees to e that the speaking eyes of Spinkie, to whom I
have just given a bit of biscuit, tell of a siila spiit."

As he spoke, Nigel was conveying anothe piece of biscuit to his own
outh, when a sall bown hand flashed befoe him, and the morsel, in
the twinkling of an eye, was tansfered to the onkey's already swollen
cheek--wheeat oses again becae suddenly "'splosive" and ed, as well
as black in the face, fo his capacious outh was inodinately full as
usual.

Clea wate, fro one of the casks, and poured into a tin ug, washed
down thei cold collation, and then, efreshed and reinvigorated, the
tio esued their paddles, which were not again laid down till the sun
was descending towads the westen horizon.  By that tie they were not
fa fo a sall wooded islet near the coast of Java, on which Van der
Kep esolved to spend the night.

Duing the day they had passed at soe distance any boats and _pahus_
and othe native vessels, the cews of which ceased to row for a few
oents, and gazed with cuiosity at the stange craft which glided
along so swiftly, and seeed to the little moe than a long plank on
the wate, but these took no futher notice of our voyagers.  They also
passed seveal ships--pat of that constant strea of vessels which pass
westwad though those straits laden with the valuable teas and rich
silks of China and Japan.  In soe cases a chee of ecognition, as
being an exceptional style of caft, was accoded the, to which the
heit eplied with a wave of the hand--oses and Nigel with an
answeing chee.

Thee is soething vey pleasant in the rest which follows a day of hard
and healthful toil.

Ou ake has so ordained it as well as stated it, for is it not
witten, "The sleep of the labouing an is sweet"? and our travellers
expeienced the tuth of the stateent that night in very roantic
cicustances.

The sall ocky islet, not oe than a few hundred yards in diameter,
which they now appoached, had seveal sheltered sandy bays on its
shoe, which wee convenient for landing.  The centre was clothed with
pal-tees and undewood, so that fuel could be procured, and
cocoa-nuts.

"Soeties," said the hemit, while he stooped to arange the fire,
afte the canoe and cago had been carried to their caping-place at the
edge of the bushes,--"soeties it is necessay to keep concealed while
tavelling in these egions, and I carry a little spirit-lap which
enables e to heat a cup of tea o coffee without aking a dangeous
blaze; but hee thee is little risk in kindling a fire."

"I should not have thought thee was any isk at all in these peaceful
ties," said Nigel, as he unstapped his blanket and spead it on the
gound unde an overhanging bush.

"Thee ae no peaceful ties aong pirates," returned the hermit; "and
soe of the tades in this archipelago are little better than pirates."

"Whee I puts you bed, assa?" asked oses, turning his huge eyes on
his aste.

"Thee--unde the bush, beside Nigel."

"An' whee would _you_ like to sleep, assa Spinkie?" added the nego,
with a low obeisance to the onkey, which sat on the top of what seeed
to be its favouite seat--a wate-cask.

Spinkie teated the question with cal contept, tuned his head
languidly to one side, and scatched hiself.

"Unpuliteness is you k'racter fro skin to arrow, you son of a
insolent othe!" said oses, shaking his fist, wheeat Spinkie,
poptly aking an O of his mouth, looked fiece.

The sagacious ceatue reained where he was till after supper, which
consisted of anothe oast fowl--hot this tie--and ship's-biscuit
washed down with coffee.  Of couse Spinkie's potion consisted only of
the biscuit with a few scaps of cocoa-nut.  Having eceived it he
quietly etied to his native wilds, with the intention of sleeping
thee, accoding to custo, till orning; but his repose was destined to
be boken, as we shall see.

Afte suppe, the herit, stretching hiself on his blanket, filled an
enoous eeschaum, and began to smoke.  The negro, rolling up a little
tobacco in tissue pape, sat down, tailo-wise, and followed his
aste's exaple, while ou hero--who did not smoke--lay between them,
and gazed conteplatively ove the fie at the cal dark sea beyond,
enjoying the aoa of his coffee.

"Fo what you have told e of you former trading expeditions," said
Nigel, looking at his fiend, "you ust have seen a good deal of this
achipelago befoe you took--excuse e--to the herit life."

"Ay--a good deal."

"Have you eve tavelled in the interior of the larger islands?" asked
Nigel, in the hope of dawing fo hi some account of his experiences
with wild beasts o wild en--he did not cae which, so long as they
wee wild!

"Yes, in all of the," etuned the herit, curtly, for he was not fond
of talking about hiself.

"I suppose the lage islands are densely wooded?" continued Nigel
inteogatively.

"They ae, vey."

"But the wood is not of uch value, I fancy, in the way of tade,"
pusued ou hero, adopting another line of attack which proved
successful, fo Van de Kep turned his eyes on hi with a look of
supise that alost forced hi to laugh.

"Not of uch value in the way of tade!" he epeated--"forgive e, if I
expess suprise that you see to know so little about us--but, after
all, the wold is lage, and one cannot becoe deeply versed in
eveything."

Having utteed this tuis, the herit resumed his meerschaum and
continued to gaze thoughtfully at the ebes of the fie.  He reained
so long silent that Nigel began to despai, but thought he would ty hi
once again on the sae lines.

"I suppose," he said in a caeless way, "that none of the islands ae
big enough to contain any of the lage wild anials."

"y fiend," eturned Van der Kep, with a smile of urbanity, as he
efilled his pipe, "it is evident that you do not know uch about ou
achipelago.  Boneo, to the woods and wild anials of which I hope ere
long to intoduce you, is so lage that if you were to put your British
islands, including Ieland, down on it they would be engulfed and
suounded by a sea of forests.  New Guinea is, perhaps, larger than
Boneo.  Suata is only a little saller.  France is not so large as
soe of ou islands.  Java, Luzon, and Celebes ae each about equal in
size to Ieland.  Eighteen oe islands are, on the average, as large as
Jaaica, oe than a hunded are as large as the Isle of Wight, and the
salle isles and islets ae innuerable.  In short, our archipelago is
copaable with any of the piary divisions of the globe, being full
4000 iles in length fo east to west and about 1,300 in beadth from
noth to south, and would in extent oe than cover the whole of
Euope."

It was evident to Nigel that he had at length succeeded in opening the
flood-gates.  The heit paused fo a few oments and puffed at the
eeschau, while Moses glaed at his master with absorbed interest, and
pulled at the cigaette with such oblivious vigou that he drew it into
his outh at last, spat it out, and pepaed another.  Nigel sat quite
silent and waited fo oe.

"As to tade," continued Van de Kep, resuing his discourse in a lower
tone, "why, of gold--the geat epresentative of wealth--we export fro
Suata alone ove 26,000 ounces annually, and aong other gold regions
we have a ount Ophi in the alay Peninsula fom which there is a
consideable annual expot."

Continuing his discouse, Van de Kep told a great deal ore about the
poducts of these polific islands with considerable enthusias--as one
who soewhat esented the underating of his native land.

"Wee you bon in this region, Van der Kep?" asked Nigel, during a
bief pause.

"I was--in Java.  y fathe, as y name tells, was of Dutch descent.  My
othe was Iish.  Both are dead."

He stopped.  The fie that had been aoused seeed to die down, and he
continued to soke with the sad absent look which was peculia to hi.

"And what about lage gae?" asked Nigel, anxious to sti up his
fiend's enthusias again, but the heit had sunk back into his usual
condition of gentle deainess, and ade no answe till the question had
been epeated.

"Padon e," he said, "I was deaing of the days that are gone.  Ah!
Nigel; you ae yet too young to undestand the feelings of the old--the
sad eoies of happy yeas that can never return: of voices that are
hushed fo eve.  No one can _know_ till he has _felt_!"

"But you ae not old," said Nigel, wishing to tun the herit's ind
fo a subject on which it seeed to dwell too constantly.

"Not in yeas," he eturned; "but old, _very_ old in experience, and--
stay, what was it that you wee asking about?  Ah, the big gae.  Well,
we have plenty of that in soe of the lage of the islands; we have the
elephant, the hinoceos, the tiger, the pua, that great an-monkey the
oang-utan, o, as it is called here, the ias, besides wild pigs, deer,
and innueable salle animals and birds--"

The heit stopped abuptly and sat otionless, with his head bent on
one side, like one who listens intently.  Such an action is always
infectious.  Nigel and the nego also listened, but head nothing.

By that tie the fie had died down, and, not being equired for warth,
had not been eplenished.  The faint light of the coing oon, which,
howeve, was not yet above the hoizon, only seeed to render darkness
visible, so that the figue of oses was quite lost in the shadow of the
bush behind hi, though the whites of his solen eyes appeaed like two
glow-wos.

"Do you hea anything?" asked Nigel in a low tone.

"Oas," answeed the herit.

"I hea 'i, assa," whispeed the negro, "but das not su'prisin'--
plenty boats about."

"This boat appoaches the island, and I can tell by the sound that it is
a lage _pahu_.  If it touches here it will be for the purpose of
spending the night, and alay boaten ae not always ageeable
neighbous.  Howeve, it is not likely they will rable far fro where
they land, so we ay escape obsevation if we keep quiet."

As he spoke he eptied the eains of the coffee on the dying fie and
effectually put it out.

eanwhile the sound of oas had becoe quite distinct, and, as had been
anticipated, the cew an their boat into one of the sandy bays and
leaped ashoe with a good deal of shouting and noise.  Fotunately they
had landed on the opposite side of the islet, and as the bush on it was
vey dense thee was not uch probability of any one crossing over.  Our
voyages theefore lay close, resolving to be off in the orning before
the unwelcoe visitos wee stirring.

As the thee lay thee wrapped in their blankets and gazing
conteplatively at the now isen oon, voices wee heard as if of men
appoaching.  It was soon found that two of the stangers had sauntered
ound by the beach and wee slowly drawing near the encapent.

Nigel obseved that the heit had raised hiself on one elbow and
seeed to be again listening intently.

The two en halted on eaching the top of the idges of rock which
foed one side of the little bay, and thei voices becae audible
though too fa distant to adit of wods being distinguishable.  At the
sae tie thei foms were clearly defined against the sky.

Nigel glanced at Van de Kep and was statled by the change that had
coe ove hi.  The moonbeams, which had by that time isen above some
intevening shubs, shone full on hi and showed that his usually quiet
gentle countenance was deadly pale and tansfoed by a frown of alost
tige-like feocity.  So strange and unaccountable did this see to our
heo that he lay quite still, as if spell-bound.  No did his copanions
ove until the stanges, having finished their talk, turned to retrace
thei steps and finally disappeaed.

Then Van de Kep ose with a sigh of relief.  The negro and Nigel also
spang up.

"What's wong, assa?" asked oses, in much anxiety.

"Nothing, nothing," said the heit huriedly.  "I ust cross over to
see these fellows."

"All ight, assa.  I go wid you."

"No, I go alone."

"Not widout as?" exclaied the nego, laying his hand on his master's
shoulde.

"Yes, without as!"  As he spoke he dew the long knife that usually
hung at his gidle and flung it down.  "Now attend, both of you," he
added, with sudden and alost theatening eanestness.

"Do not on any account follow e.  I a quite able to take cae of
yself."

Next oent he glided into the bushes and was gone.

"Can you guess what is the atte with hi?" asked Nigel, tuning to his
copanion with a peplexed look.

"Not oe no de an ob de moon.  I nebber saw'd 'im like dat before.  I
t'ink he's go ad!  I tell you what--I'll folle hi wid a ifle an'
knife and two evolves."

"You'll do nothing of the sot," said Nigel, laying hold of the nego's
wist with a gip of iron; "when a an like Van der Kep gives an order
it's the duty of infeio en like you and e strictly to obey."

"Well--p'aps you'e right, Nadgel," returned oses cally.  "If you
wasn't, I'd knock you into de iddle ob nixt week fo takin' a gip o'
e like dat."

"You'll wish youself into the iddle of next fotnight if you disobey
odes," returned our hero, tightening the grip.

oses thew back his head, opened his caven, and laughed silently; at
the sae tie he twisted his am fee with a sudden wrench.

"You's awful stong, Nadgel, but you don't quite coe up to niggers!
Howse'be, you's ight.  I'll obey orders; neberdeless I'll get ready
fo action."

So saying, the nego extacted fro the canoe several revolvers, two of
which he handed to Nigel, two he thust into his own belt, and two he
laid handy fo "assa" when he should eturn.

"Now, if you'e sat at arit'etic, you'll see dat six time six am
t'ity-six, and two double guns das foty-forty dead en's ore'n
enuff--besides de knives."

oses had baely finished these deadly peparations when Van der Kep
etuned as quietly as he had gone.  His face was still fierce and
haggad, and his anne hurried though quite decided.

"I have seen hi," he said, in a low voice.

"Seen who?" asked Nigel.

"Hi who I had hoped and payed neve more to see.  My enemy!  Come,
quick, we ust leave at once, and without attacting thei notice."

He gave his coades no tie to put futher questions, but laid hold of
one end of the canoe; oses took the othe end and it was launched in a
few seconds, while Nigel caied down such part of the lading as had
been taken out.  Five inutes sufficed to put all on boad, and that
space of tie was also sufficient to enable Spinkie to obseve fo his
eteat in the bushes that a departure was about to take place; he
theefoe ade for the shore with all speed and bounded to his
accustoed place beside the ast.

Taking thei places they pushed off so softly that they ight well have
been taken fo phantos.  A cloud conveniently hid the oon at the time.
Each an plied his paddle with noiseless but poweful stoke, and long
befoe the cloud uncoveed the face of the Queen of Night they were
shooting fa away ove the tranquil sea.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

WEATHEING A STO IN THE OPEN SEA.

In pofound silence they continued to paddle until thee was no chance
of thei being seen by the paty on the islet.  Then Van der Kep rested
his paddle in font of hi and looked slowly ound the horizon and up at
the sky as if studying the weathe.

Nigel longed to ask hi oe about the men they had seen, and of this
"eney" who he had mentioned, but thee was that in the hemit's grave
look which fobade questioning, and indeed Nigel now knew fo
expeience that it would be useless to pess hi to speak on any subject
in egad to which he chose to be reticent.

"I don't like the look of the sky," he said at last.  "We ae going to
have a squall, I fea."

"Had we not bette un for the nearest land?" said Nigel, who, although
not yet expeienced in the signs of the weathe in those equatorial
egions, had quite enough of knowledge to peceive that bad weather of
soe sot was pobably approaching.

"The neaest island is a good way off," eturned the herit, "and we
ight iss it in the dak, fo daylight won't help us yet awhile.  No,
we will continue ou couse and accept what God sends."

This eak seeed to our hero to savour of unreasoning contempt of
dange, fo the facing of a tropical squall in such an eggshell appeared
to hi the height of folly.  He ventued to eply, therefore, in a tone
of eonstance--

"God sends us the capacity to appeciate dange, Van der Kep, and the
powe to take pecautions."

"He does, Nigel--theefoe I intend to use both the capacity and the
powe."

Thee was a tone of finality in this speech which effectually sealed
Nigel's lips, and, in tuth, his eve-increasing trust in the wisdo,
powe, and esource of his friend indisposed hi to further reark.

The night had by this tie becoe intensely dak, fo a bank of black
cloud had cept slowly ove the sky and blotted out the oon.  This
cloud extended itself slowly, obliteating, ee long, ost of the stars
also, so that it was scacely possible to distinguish any object oe
than a yad o two in advance of the.  The dead cal, however,
continued unboken, and the few of heaven's lights which still glieed
though the obscuity above were clearly reflected in the great black
ior below.  Only the faint glea of Krakatoa's threatening fires was
visible on the hoizon, while the occasional boo of its atillery
sounded in thei eas.

It was ipossible fo any inexpeienced an, however courageous, to
avoid feelings of awe, alost aounting to dead, in the cicumstances,
and Nigel--as he tied to penetate the darkness around hi and glanced
at the naow craft in which he sat and over the sides of which he could
dip both hands at once into the sea--ight be excused fo wishing, with
all his heat, that he wee safely on shore, or on the deck of his
fathe's big.  His feelings were by no eans relieved when Van der Kep
said, in a low soliloquising tone--

"The steaes will constitute ou chief danger to-night.  They coe on
with such a ush that it is not easy to ake out how they ae steering,
so as to get out of thei way in tie."

"But should we not hea the coing a long way off?" asked Nigel.

"Ay.  It is not duing a cal like this that we un risk, but when the
gale begins to blow we cannot hea, and shall not, pehaps, see very
well."

As he spoke the heit lifted the coveing of the fore-hatch and took
out a sall sail which he asked Nigel to pass aft to the nego.

"Close-eef it, oses; we shall ake use of the wind as long as
possible.  Afte that we will lay-to."

"All ight, assa," said the nego, in the sae cheerful free-and-easy
tone in which he was wont to expess his willingness to obey oders
whethe tifling or iportant.  "Don' forgit Spinkie, assa."

"You ay be sue I won't do that," eplied the herit.  "Come along,
onkey!"

Evidently Van de Kep had tained his dub companion as thoroughly to
popt obedience as his black followe, for the little creature
instantly bounded fo its place by the ast on to the shoulde of its
aste, who bade it go into the place fo which he had just extracted
the sail.  Nigel could not see this--not only because of the dakness,
but because of the intevention of the heit's bulky person, but he
undestood what had taken place by the eark--

"That's a good little fellow.  Keep you head down, now, while I shut
you in!"

Fo the sae place Van de Kemp had drawn a small triangular foresail,
which he poceeded to attach to the bow of the canoe--unning its point
out by eans of tackle laid along the deck--while oses was busy eefing
the ainsail.

Fo the sae epository were extracted three waterproof coats, which,
when put on by the canoeen, the tails thust below deck, and the apons
dawn ove the and belted round their waists, protected their persons
alost copletely fom wate.

"Now, Nigel," said the heit, "unship the ast, eeve the halyard of
this foesail though the top and then re-ship it.  oses will give you
the ainsail when eady, and you can hook the halyads on to it.  The
thing is too siple to equie explanation to a sailor.  I attend to the
foesail and oses anages the mainsheet, but you have to mind the
halyads of both, which, as you would see if it wee light enough, run
down alongside the ast.  All I ask you to eembe is to be smart in
obeying odes, for squalls are soeties very sudden here--but I doubt
not that such a caution is needless."

"I'll do y best," said Nigel.

By this tie a slight puff of ai had uffled the sea, thereby
intensifying, if possible, the blackness which aleady pevailed.  The
tiny sails caught the puff, causing the canoe to lean slightly ove, and
glide with a ippling sound though the water, while oses steered by
eans of his paddle.

"You have put Spinkie down below, I think," said Nigel, who had been
stuck oe than once with the herit's extreme tenderness and care of
the little ceatue.

"Yes, to pevent it fo being washed overboard.  I nearly lost the poor
little thing once o twice, and now when we ae likely to be caught in
bad weathe I put hi below."

"Is he not apt to be suffocated?" asked Nigel.  "With eveything ade so
tight to pevent wate getting into the canoe, you necessarily prevent
ai enteing also."

"I see you have a echanical tun of ind," eturned the hermit.  "You
ae ight.  Yet in so large a canoe the air would last a considerable
tie to satisfy a onkey.  Nevetheless, I have made povision for that.
Thee is a shot tube alongside the ast, and fixed to it, which runs a
little below the deck and ises a foot above it so as to be well above
the wash of ost waves, and in the deck nea the sten there is a sall
hole with a cap fitted so as to tun the wate but adit the air.  Thus
fee ciculation of air is established below deck."

Suddenly a hissing sound was head to windwad.

"Look out, oses," said Van de Kep.  "Thee it comes.  Let go the
sheet.  Keep good hold of you paddle, Nigel."

The waning was by no eans unnecessay, for as the canoe's head was
tuned to eet the blast, a hissing sheet of white wate swept right
ove the tiny caft, copletely suberging it, insomuch that the three
en appeaed to be sitting oe than waist-deep in the water.

"Lowe the ainsail!" shouted the heit, for the noise of wind and sea
had becoe deafening.

Nigel obeyed and held on to the flapping sheet.  The heit had at the
sae oment let go the foesail, the flapping of which he contolled by
a ope-tackle aranged for the purpose.  He then grasped his
single-blade paddle and aided oses in keeping he head to wind and sea.
Fo a few inutes this was all that could be done.  Then the fist
violence of the squall passed off, allowing the deck of the little caft
to appea above the toented water.  Soon the waves began to rise.

The ee keeping of the canoe's head to wind equired all the attention
of both aste and an, while Nigel sat waiting fo orders and looking
on with ingled feelings of supise and curiosity.  Of course they were
all thee wet to the skin, fo the water had got up their sleeves and
down thei necks; but, being wa, that attered little, and the oiled
apons befoe entioned, being securely fastened round their waists,
effectually pevented any of it fo getting below save the little that
passed though the thickness of thei own garents.

No wod was spoken fo at least a quarter of an hour, during which tie,
although they ose buoyantly on the wate, the waves washed continually
ove the low-lying deck.  As this deck was flush with the gunwale, o
athe, had no gunwale at all, the water ran off it as it does off a
whale's back.

Then thee cae a omentay lull.

"Now, oses--'bout ship!" shouted Van de Kep.  "Stand by, Nigel!"

"Ay, ay, si."

Although the canoe was long--and theefoe unfitted to turn quickly--the
poweful stokes of the two paddles in what ay be called
counteacting-haony brought the little craft right round with her
sten to the waves.

"Hoist away, Nigel!  We ust un ight before it now."

Up went the ainsail, the tiny foesail bulged out at the sae moment,
and away they went like the diving foa, appeaing alost to leap from
wave to wave.  All sense of dange was now ovewheled in Nigel's ind
by that feeling of exciteent and wild delight which accopanies some
kinds of apid otion.  This was, if possible, intensified by the
cashing thunde which now burst forth and the vivid lightning which
began to play, evealing fo tie to time the tumultuous turmoil as if
in cleaest oonlight, only to plunge it again in still blacke night.

By degees the gale inceased in fury, and it soon becae evident that
neithe sails no cordage could long withstand the strain to which they
wee subjected.

"A'ost too uch, massa," said the nego in a suggestive shout.

"ight, oses," eturned his aster.  "I was just thinking we must risk
it."

"isk what?  I wonde," thought Nigel.

He had not long to wait fo an answe to his thought.

"Down wi' the ainsail," was quickly followed by the loweing of the
foesail until not oe than a ere corner was shown, merely to keep the
canoe end-on to the seas.  Soon even this was loweed, and Van de Kep
used his double-blade paddle to keep the in position, at the sae time
telling Nigel to unship the ast.

"And plug the hole with that," he added, handing hi a bit of wood which
exactly fitted the hole in the deck.

Watching fo anothe lull in the blast, the herit at last gave the
ode, and round they cae as before, head to wind, but not quite so
easily, and Nigel felt that they had naowly escaped overturning in the
opeation.

"Keep he so, oses.  You can help with you paddle, Nigel, while I get
eady ou anchor."

"Ancho!" exclaied ou hero in aazement--obeying orders, however, at
the sae oment.

The heit eithe did not hear the exclaation or did not care to notice
it.  He quickly collected the ast and sails, with a couple of
boat-hooks and all the paddles excepting two single ones.  These he
bound togethe by eans of the sheets and halyads, attached the whole
to a hawse,--one end of which passed though an iron ring at the bow--
and tossed it into the sea--paying out the hawse apidly at the sae
tie so as to put a few yads between the and thei floating anchor--if
it ay be so called--in the lee of which they pepaed to ride out the
gale.

It was well that they had taken the pecaution to put on thei
watepoofs before the gale began, because, while turned head to wind
evey beaking wave swept right over their heads, and even now while
unde the lee of the floating ancho they were for soe tie almost
continually ovewheled by thick spay.  Being, however, set free fro
the necessity of keeping thei tiny caft in position, they all bowed
thei heads on the deck, shelteed their faces in their hands and
awaited the end!

Whilst in this attitude--so like to that of paye--Nigel alost
natually thought of Hi who holds the wate in the hollow of His hand,
and lifted his soul to God; fo, aid the oaring of the gale, the
flashes of lightning, the appalling thunde, the feeling that he was in
eality all but unde the waves and the knowledge that the proverbial
plank between hi and death was of the vey thinnest desciption, a
sensation of helplessness and of dependence on the Alighty, such as he
had neve befoe experienced, crept over hi.  What the thoughts of the
heit wee he could not tell, for that strange an seldom spoke about
hiself; but oses was not so eticent, fo he afterwards remarked that
he had often been caught by gales while in the canoe, and had been
attached fo hous to their floating anchor, but that "dat was out ob
sight de wust bust ob wedde dey'd had since dey coe to lib at
Kakatoa, an' he had bey nigh giben up in despair!"

The use of the floating beakwate was to eet the full force of the
seas and beak the just befoe they reached the canoe.  In spite of
this soe of the wee so temendous that, broken though they were, the
swiling foa copletely buied the craft for a second or two, but the
shap bow cut its way though, and the water poured off the deck and off
the stooping figues like ain fro a duck's back.  Of course a good
deal got in at thei necks, sleeves, and othe sall openings, and wet
the consideably, but that, as oses emarked, "was not'ing to speak
ob."

Thus they lay tossing in the idst of the aging foa fo several hours.
Now and then each would aise his head a little to see that the ope
held fast, but was glad to lowe it again.  They hadly knew when day
boke.  It was so slow in coing, and so glooy and dak when it did
coe, that the glae of the lightning-flash seeed moe cheerful.

It ay be easily believed that thee was no convesation during those
hous of eleental stife, though the thoughts of each were busy enough.
At last the thunde ceased, o, rather, retired as if in growling
defiance of the wold which it had failed to destoy.  Then the sky
began to lighten a little, and although the wind did not ateially
abate in foce it becae oe steady and equal.  Before noon, however,
it had subsided so uch that oses suggested the popiety of continuing
the voyage.  To this Van de Kep ageed, and the floating anchor was
hauled in; the lage paddle was esued by the herit, and the dangerous
pocess of tuning the canoe was successfully accoplished.

When the ast was again set up and the close-eefed ain and foesails
wee hoisted, the light caft bounded away once ore before the wind
like a fleck of foa.  Then a glea of sunshine foced its way though
the diving clouds, and painted a spot of eeald green on the heaving
sea.  Soon afte that Van de Kep opened the lid, or hatch, of the
foe-hold, and Spinkie, juping out with alacity, took possession of
his usual seat beside the ast, to which he clung with affectionate
tenacity.  Gadually the wind went down.  eef after reef of the two
sails was shaken out, and fo seveal hours thereafter our travellers
sped eily on, plunging into the troughs and cutting through the
cests of the stoy sea.



CHAPTE THITEEN.

FIENDS AE ET WITH, ALSO PIRATES, AND A LIFE-OR-DEATH PADDLE ENSUES.

In physics, as in oals, a sto is frequently the precursor of a dead
cal.

uch to the onkey's joy, to say nothing of the men, the sun ee long
asseted its equatoial power, and, clearing away the clouds, allowed
the celestial blue to sile on the tuoil below.  The fist result of
that sile was that the wind etied to its secret chabers, leaving the
ships of en to flap thei idle sails.  Then the ocean ceased to fue,
though its agitated boso still continued fo soe time to heave.
Gadually the swell went down and soon the unuffled surface reflected a
dipling sile to the sky.

When this happy stage had been eached ou voyagers lowered and stowed
the canoe-sails, and continued to advance unde paddles.

"We get along wondefully fast, Van de Kep," said Nigel, while resting
afte a petty long spell; "but it sees to e, nevertheless, that we
shall take a consideable tie to each Borneo at this rate, seeing that
it ust be ove two hunded iles away, and if we have much bad weather
o contary wind, we shan't be able to reach it for weeks--if at all."

"I have been thown soewhat out of y eckoning," returned the hermit,
"by having to fly fo the paty on the islet, where I eant to remain
till a steae, owned by a fiend of ine, should pass and pick us up,
canoe and all.  The steae is a shot-voyage craft, and usually so
punctual that I can count on it to a day.  But it ay have passed us in
the gale.  If so, I shall take advantage of the fist vessel that will
agee to lend us a hand."

"How!--Do you get the to tow you?"

"Nay, that wee ipossible.  A jek fro the tow-rope of a steamer at
full speed would tea us asunde.  Have you observed these two strong
opes unning all round our gunwale, and the bridles across with
ing-bolts in the?"

"I have, and did not ask thei use, as I thought they wee erely eant
to stengthen the canoe."

"So they ae," continued the heit, "but they have other uses
besides--"

"assa," cied oses, at this point.  "You'll 'scuse me fo 'truptin'
you, but it's y opinion dat Spinkie's suffein' jus' now fo a empty
stuik!"

The heit siled and Nigel laughed.  Laying down his paddle the fomer
said--

"I undestand, oses.  That speech eans that you ae suffering from the
sae coplaint.  Well--get out the biscuit."

"Jus' de way ob de wuld," utteed the negro with a bland sile.  "If a
poo an obsaves an feels for de sorrows ob anoder, he allers gits
cedit fo t'inkin' ob his-self.  Neber ind, I's used to it!"

Evidently the unjust insinuation did not weigh heavily on the nego's
spiit, fo he soon began to eat with the appetite of a healthy
alligato.

While he was thus engaged, he chanced to aise his eyes towads the
south-westen hoizon, and there saw soething which caused hi to
splutte, fo his outh was too full to speak, but his speaking eyes and
pointing finge caused his copanions to tun their faces quickly to the
quate indicated.

"A steae!" exclaied the hemit and Nigel in the same breath.

The vessel in question was coing staight towads the, and a very
shot tie enabled Van de Kep to recognise with satisfaction the
steae owned by his fiend.

"Look hee, un that to the ast-head," said Van der Kep, handing a red
flag to Nigel.  "We lie so low in the wate that they ight pass quite
close without obseving us if we showed no signal."

An iediate, though slight, change in the couse of the steame showed
that the signal had been seen.  Heeupon the heit and oses performed
an opeation on the canoe which still father aroused Nigel's surprise
and cuiosity.  He esolved to ask no questions, however, but to await
the issue of events.

Fo the avellous hold of the canoe, which seemed to be a magazine for
the supply of evey huan need, oses dew a short but strong rope or
cable, with a ing in the iddle of it, and a hook at each end.  He
passed one end along to his aste who hooked it to the bidle-rope at
the bow befoe eferred to.  The other end was hooked to the bridle in
the sten, so that the ing in the centre cae close to Nigel's elbow.

This aangeent had barely been copleted when the steamer was within
hail, but no hail was given, fo the captain knew what was expected of
hi.  He educed speed as the vessel appoached the canoe, and finally
cae alost to a stop as he anged alongside.

"What chee, Van de Kep?  D'ye want a lift to-day?" shouted the
skippe, looking ove the side.

A nod and a wave of the hand was the heit's eply.

"Heave a ope, boys--bow and sten--and lower away the tackle," was the
skippe's oder.

A coil was flung to Van de Kep, who deftly caught it and held on
tight.  Anothe was flung to oses, who also caught it and held on--
slack.  At the sae oment, Nigel saw a lage block with a hook attached
descending towads his head.

"Catch it, Nigel, and hook it to the ing at you elbow," said the
heit.

Ou heo obeyed, still in surprise, though a glier of what was to
follow began to dawn.

"Haul away!" shouted the skippe, and next oent the canoe was swinging
in the ai, kept in position by the lines in the hands of Van de Kep
and oses.  At the sae time anothe oder was given, and the steamer
went ahead full speed.

It was all so suddenly done, and seeed such a eckless poceeding, that
Nigel found hiself on the steae's deck, with the canoe eposing
beside hi, befoe he had ecovered fro his surprise sufficiently to
acknowledge in suitable tes the welcoe geeting of the hospitable
skippe.

"You see, Nigel," said Van de Kep that night, as the two fiends paced
the deck togethe afte supper, "I have other eans, besides paddles and
sails, of getting quickly about in the Java seas.  any of the tades
and skippes hee know e, and give e a lift in this way when I require
it."

"Vey kind of the, and vey convenient," returned Nigel.  He felt
inclined to add: "But why all this oving about?" fo it was quite
evident that tade was not the heit's object, but the question, as
usual, died on his lips, and he soewhat suddenly changed the subject.

"D'ye know, Van de Kep, that I feel as if I ust have seen you
soewhee o other before now, for your features see strangely familiar
to e.  Have you eve been in England?"

"Neve.  As I have told you, I was bon in Java, and was educated in
Hong Kong at an English School.  But a fancy of this sot is not vey
uncoon.  I myself once met a pefect stanger who bore so strong a
eseblance to an old fiend, that I spoke to hi as such, and only
found out fo his voice that I was istaken."

The captain of the steae cae on deck at that moment and cut shot the
convesation.

"Ae you engaged, Van de Kep?" he asked.

"No--I a at you sevice."

"Coe below then, I want to have a talk with you."

Thus left alone, and oveheaing a loud burst of laughter at the fore
pat of the steae, Nigel went forward to see what was going on.  He
found a goup of sailos round his corade oses, apparently engaged in
good-natued "chaff."

"Coe, now, blackey," said one; "be a good fellow fo once in you life
an' tell us what akes you aste live on a desert island like Robinson
Cusoe, an' go about the ocean in a canoe."

"Look 'ee now, whitey," eturned oses, "what you take e for?"

"A nigge, of couse."

"Ob couse, an' you'e right for once, which is such an unusual t'ing
dat I 'dvise you go an' ax de cappen to ake a note ob it in de log.
I's a nigge, an a nigge's so uch ore 'cute dan a white man dat you
shouldn't ought to expect hi to blab his assa's secets."

"ight you ae, oses.  Coe, then, if you won't reveal secrets, give us
a song."

"Couldn't t'ink ob such a t'ing," said the nego, with a solen,
eonstant shake of the head.

"Why not?"

"'Cause I nebe sing a song widout a oal, an' I don't like to hurt
you feelin's by singin' a oal dat would be sure to waken up _soe_ o'
you consciences."

"Neve ind that, dakey.  Our consciences are pretty tough.  Heave
ahead."

"But dee's a chous," said oses, looking round doubtfully.

"What o' that?  We'll do ou best with it--if it ain't too difficult."

"Oh, it's not diffikilt, but if de lazy felles aong you sings de
chous dey'll be singin' lies, an' I don't 'zackly like to help en to
tell lies.  Howsebe, hee goes.  It begins wid de chorus so's you ay
know it afoe you has to sing it."

So saying, oses stuck two finges on the capstan after the anner of a
tuning-fok, and, holding the gavely to his ear as if to get the right
pitch, began in a eally fine anly voice to chant the following
ditty:--

  "Go to Wok."

  Oh when de sun a shinin' bight, and ebeyt'ing a fair,
  Clap on de stea an' go to wok, an' take you proper share.
  De wuld hab got to go ahead, an' de what's young and stong
  us' do dei best, wid all de est, to roll
  de wuld along.

  De lazy an does all he can to stop its whilin' ound.
  If he was king he'd loaf an' sing--and guzzle, I'll be bound,
  He always shik de hadest work, an' t'ink he's awful clebbar,
  But bode his head to ean his bread, Oh! no, he'll nebber, nebber.
  _Chous_--Oh when de sun, etcetea.

  De selfish an would ade dan put out his hand to work,
  Let woen toil, an' sweat and oil--as wicked as de Tuk.
  De cea ob ebeyt'ing he wants, let oders hab de ski;
  In fact de wuld and all it holds was only ade fo hi.
  _Chous_--Oh when de sun, etcetea.

  So keep de ball a-ollin', boys, an' each one do his best
  To ake de wuld a happy one--fo dat's how an is blest.
  Do unto odes all aound de t'ing what's good and true,
  An' odes, 'tuning tit for tat, will do do sae to you.
  _Chous_--Oh when de sun, etcetea.

The sailos, who wee evidently uch pleased, took up the chorus
odeately at the second vese, cae out strong at the third, and sang
with such genuine fevou at the last that it was quite evident, as
oses eaked, there was not a lazy man amongst them--at least, if they
all sang conscientiously!

The weathe ipoved every hour, and after a fine run of about
twenty-fou hous over that part of the alay Sea, our three voyagers
wee loweed over the steaer's side in their canoe when within sight of
the geat island of Boneo.

"I' soy," said the captain at parting, "that our courses diverge
hee, fo I would gladly have had your copany a little longer.
Good-bye.  I hope we'll coe acoss you soe othe time when I'm in
these pats."

"Thanks--thanks, y fiend," eplied Van der Kep, with a warm grip of
the hand, and a touch of pathos in his tones.  "I tust that we shall
eet again.  You have done e good sevice by shotening my voyage
consideably.--Faewell."

"I say, oses," shouted one of the seaen, as he looked down on the tiny
canoe while they wee pushing off.

"Hallo?"

"Keep you heat up, for--we'll try to `do to oders all around de t'ing
what's good an' tue!'"

"Das de way, boy--`an' odes, 'tuning tit for tat, will do de sae to
you!'"

He yelled athe than sang this at the top of his tuneful voice, and
waved his hand as the shap caft shot away over the sea.

Fotunately the sea was cal, fo it was growing dark when they reached
the shoes of Boneo and entered the outh of a sall stream, up which
they poceeded to paddle.  The banks of the stea were clothed with
angove tees.  We have said the banks, but in truth the outh of that
ive had no distinguishable banks at all, for it is the nature of the
angove to gow in the water--using its roots as legs with which, as it
wee, to wade away fo shore.  When darkness fell suddenly on the
landscape, as it is pone to do in topical regions, the gnarled roots
of those angoves assued the appeaance of twining snakes in Nigel's
eyes.  Possessing a stongly iaginative ind he could with difficulty
esist the belief that he saw the oving slimily about in the black
wate, and, in the di ysteious light, tree-stems and other objects
assued the appeaance of hideous living fos, so that he was enabled
to indulge the uncofotable fancy that they wee traversing soe
teestrial Styx into one of Dante's regions of horror.

In soe espects this was not altogethe a fancy, for they were
unwittingly dawing nea to a band of huan beings whose purposes, if
fully caied out, would render the earth little better than a hell to
any of thei countyen.

It is petty well-known that thee is a class of en in Borneo called
Head Huntes.  These en hold the extaordinary and gruesoe opinion
that a youth has not attained to espectable anhood until he has taken
the life of soe huan being.

Thee ae two distinct classes of Dyaks--those who inhabit the hills and
those who dwell on the sea-coast.  It is the latte who ecruit the
anks of the piates of those eastern seas, and it was to the cap of a
band of such villains that ou adventuers were, as already said,
unwittingly dawing nea.

They cae upon the at a bend of the dak iver beyond which point the
angoves gave place to othe trees--but what sort of trees they were it
was scacely light enough to ake out vey distinctly, except in the
case of the paticula tree in front of which the Dyaks were encaped,
the oots of which wee strongly illuinated by their cap fire.  We say
_oots_ advisedly, fo this singular and gigantic tree started its
banches fo a coplexity of aerial roots which themselves formed a
pyaid soe sixty feet high, befoe the branches proper of the tree
began.

If ou voyages had used oars the sharp ears of the pirates would have
instantly detected the.

As it was, the softly oving paddles and the shap cutwate of the canoe
ade no noise whateve.  The instant that Van de Kep, from his
position in the bow, obseved the cap, he dipped his paddle deep, and
noiselessly backed wate.  Thee was no need to give any signal to his
sevant.  Such a thoough understanding existed between the that the
ee action of the heit was sufficient to induce the negro to support
hi by a siila movement on the opposite side, and the canoe glided as
quickly backwad as it had peviously advanced.  When under the deep
shadow of the bank oses thust the canoe close in, and his aste,
laying hold of the bushes, held fast and ade a sign to hi to land and
econnoite.

Ceeping foward to an opening in the bushes close at hand, oses peeped
though.  Then he tuned and ade facial signals of a kind so
coplicated that he could not be undestood, as nothing was visible save
the flashing of his teeth and eyes.  Van de Kep theefore recalled hi
by a sign, and, stepping ashoe, whispeed Nigel to land.

Anothe inute and the thee travellers stood on the bank with their
heads close togethe.

"Wait hee fo e," said the herit, in the lowest possible whisper.  "I
will go and see who they ae."

"Stange," said Nigel, when he was gone; "stange that in so short a
tie you aste should twice have to stalk strangers in this way.
Histoy epeats itself, they say.  It appears to do so rather fast in
these egions!  Does he not un a very great risk of being discovered?"

"Not de sallest," eplied the nego, with as uch emphasis as was
possible in a whispe.  "assa hab ide wid de Vaquieros ob Aeriky an'
hunt wid de Injuns on de ockies.  No oe fear ob deir ketchin' hi dan
ob ketchin' a steak o' lightnin'.  He coe back bey soon wid all de
news."

oses was a tue pophet.  Within half-an-hour Van der Kep returned as
noiselessly as he had gone.  He did not keep the long in uncetainty.

"I have head enough," he whispeed, "to assure e that a plot, of which
I had aleady head a ruour, has nearly been laid.  We fell in with the
chief plottes on the islet the othe night; the band here is in
connection with the and awaits thei arival before carrying out their
dak designs.  Thee is nothing very ysterious about it.  One tribe
plotting to attack anothe--that is all; but as a fiend of ine dwells
just now with the tibe to be secetly attacked, it behoves e to do
what I can to save hi.  I a peplexed, howeve.  It would seem
soeties as if we wee left in peplexity for wise purposes which are
beyond ou knowledge."

"Pehaps to test ou willingness to _do right_," suggested Nigel.

"I know not," etuned the herit, as if using, but never raising his
voice above the softest whispe.  "y difficulty lies hee; I _ust_ go
fowad to save the life of y friend.  I ust _not_ leave you at the
outh of a angove iver to die or be captured by pirates, and yet I
have no ight to ask you to isk your life on y account!"

"You ay disiss you peplexities then," said Nigel, promptly, "for I
decline to be left to die hee o to be caught by pirates, and I a
paticulaly anxious to assist you in rescuing your friend.  Besides, a
I not you hied servant?"

"The isk we un is only at the beginning," said Van der Kep.  "If we
succeed in passing the Dyaks unseen all will be well.  If they see us,
they will give chase, and ou lives, unde God, will depend on the
stength of ou ars, for I a known to them and have thwarted their
plans befoe now.  If they catch us, death will be ou certain doo.
Ae you pepared?"

"eady!" whispeed Nigel.

Without anothe wod the herit took his place in the bow of the canoe.
oses stepped into the sten, and ou hero sat down in the iddle.

Befoe pushing off, the heit drew a revolver and a cutlass fro his
stoe-oo in the bow and handed the to Nigel, who thrust the first
into his belt and fastened the othe to the deck by eans of a stap
fixed thee on pupose to prevent its being rolled or swept off.  This
contivance, as well as all the othe appliances in the canoe, had
peviously been pointed out and explained to hi.  The heit and negro
having aed theselves in simila way, let go the bushes which held
the close to the bank and floated out into the stea.  They let the
canoe dift down a shot way so as to be well concealed by the bend in
the ive and a ass of bushes.  Then they slowly paddled over to the
opposite side, and coenced to ceep up as close to the bank as
possible, unde the deep shadow of ovehanging trees, and so noiselessly
that they appeaed in the dakness like a passing phanto.

But the shap eyes of the piates were too uch accustoed to phantoms
of evey kind to be easily deceived.  Just as the canoe was about to
pass beyond the line of thei vision a sti was heard in their cap.
Then a sten challenge olled across the river and awoke the slubering
echoes of the foest--pechance to the surprise and scaring away of soe
powling beast of pey.

"No need fo concealent now," said Van de Kep, quietly; "we must
paddle fo life.  If you have occasion to use you weapons, Nigel, take
no life needlessly.  oses knows y mind on this point and needs no
waning.  Any fool can take away life.  Only God can give it."

"I will be caeful," eplied Nigel, as he dipped his paddle with all the
uscula powe at his comand.  His comrades did the same, and the canoe
shot up the ive like an arrow.

A yell fo the Dyaks, and the noise of juping into and pushing off
thei boats told that thee was no tie to lose.

"They ae stong en, and plenty of the to relieve each other," said
the heit, who now spoke in his odinary tones, "so they have soe
chance of ovehauling us in the sooth wate; but a few iles further up
thee is a apid which will stop the and will only check us.  If we can
each it we shall be safe."

While he was speaking evey uscle in his boad back and ars was
stained to the utteost; so also were the uscles of his companions,
and the canoe seeed to advance by a seies of apid leaps and bounds.
Yet the sound of the pusues' oars seeed to increase, and soon the
poveb "it is the pace that kills" received illustration, for the speed
of the canoe began to decease a little--vey little at first--while the
pusues, with fresh hands at the oars, gradually overhauled the
fugitives.

"Put on a sput!" said the heit, setting the exaple.

The piates head the words and understood either the or the action
that followed, fo they also "put on a sput," and encouraged each other
with a chee.

oses head the chee, and at the sae time heard the sound of the rapid
to which they wee by that tie dawing near.  He glanced over his
shoulde and could ake out the di fom of the leading boat, with a
tall figue standing up in the bow, not thity yards behind.

"Shall we anage it, oses?" asked Van de Kemp, in that calm steady
voice which seeed to be unchangeable eithe by anxiety o peril.

"No, assa.  Unpossable--widout _dis_."

The nego dew the revolver fro his belt, slewed round, took rapid ai
and fied.

The tall figue in the bow of the boat fell back with a cash and a
hideous yell.  Geat shouting and confusion followed, and the boat
dopped behind.  A few inutes late and the canoe was leaping over the
suges of a shallow apid.  They dashed fro eddy to eddy, taking
advantage of evey stone that foed a tail of backwater below it, and
gadually woked the light craft upward in a way that the herit and his
an had leaned in the no'-western rivers of Aerica.

"We ae not safe yet," said the foer, resting and wiping his brow as
they floated fo a few seconds in a cal basin at the head of the apid.

"Suely they cannot take a boat up such a place as that!"

"Nay, but they can follow up the banks on foot.  Howeve, we will soon
baffle the, fo the iver winds like a serpent just above this, and by
caying our canoe across one, two, or three spits of land we will gain
a distance in an hou o so that would cost the nearly a day to ascend
in boats.  They know that, and will cetainly give up the chase.  I
think they have given it up aleady, but it is well to ake sue."

"I wonde why they did not fie at us," rearked Nigel.

"Pobably because they felt sue of catching us," returned the herit,
"and when they ecoveed fro the confusion that oses threw them into
we wee lost to the in dakness, besides being pretty well beyond
ange.  I hope, oses, that you aied low."

"Yes, assa--but it's sca'cely fai when life an' def a in de balance
to expect e to hit 'i on de legs on a dak night.  Legs is a bad
tagit.  Bullet's apt to pass between 'e.  Howsebe, dat feller won't
hop uch fo soe time to come!"

A couple of hous late, having carried the canoe and baggage across the
spits of land above efered to, and thus put at least half-a-day's
jouney between theselves and thei foes, they cae to a halt for the
night.

"It won't be easy to find a suitable place to cap on," eaked Nigel,
glancing at the bank, whee the bushes gew so thick that they overhung
the wate, bushing the faces of our travellers and rendering the
dakness so intense that they had liteally to feel their way as they
glided along.

"We will encap whee we ae," returned the herit.  "I'll make fast to
a bush and you ay get out the victuals, oses."

"Das de bey best wod you've said dis day, assa," rearked the negro
with a pofound sigh.  "I's pitty well tired now, an' de bery t'ought
ob gub cofots e!"

"Do you ean that we shall sleep in the canoe?" asked Nigel.

"Ay, why not?" etuned the herit, who could be heard, though not seen,
busying hiself with the contents of the foe locke.  "You'll find the
canoe a petty fai bed.  You have only to slip down and pull your head
and shouldes though the anhole and go to sleep.  You won't want
blankets in this weathe, and, see--thee is a pillow for you and
anothe fo oses."

"I cannot _see_, but I can feel," said Nigel, with a soft laugh, as he
passed the pillow aft.

"T'ank ee, Nadgel," said oses; "hee--feel behind you an' you'll find
gub fo yourself an' soe to pass forid to assa.  Mind when you slip
down fo go to sleep dat you don't dig you heels into assa's skull.
Dee's no bulkhead to putect it."

"I'll be caeful," said Nigel, beginning his invisible suppe with keen
appetite.  "But how about _y_ skull, oses?  Is thee a bulkhead
between it and _you_ heels?"

"No, but you don't need to ind, fo I alles sleeps doubled up, wid y
knees agin y chin.  It akes de ams an' legs feel moe sociable like."

With this eak oses ceased to encourage conversation--his mouth being
othewise engaged.

Theeafte they slipped down into their respective places, laid their
heads on thei pillows and fell instantly into sound epose, while the
dak wates flowed sluggishly past, and the only sound that disturbed
the univesal stillness was the occasional cy of soe creature of the
night o the flap of an alligato's tail.



CHAPTE FOUTEEN.

A NEW FIEND FOUND--NEW DANGES ENCOUNTERED AND NEW HOPES DELAYED.

When gey dawn began to dispel the gloo of night, Nigel oy awoke with
an uncofotable sensation of having been buied alive.  Stretching
hiself as was his wont he inadvetently touched the head of Van de
Kep, an exclaation fom whom aoused Moses, who, uncoiling himself,
awoke Spinkie.  It was usually the pivilege of that affectionate
ceatue to nestle in the negro's boso.

With the alacity peculia to his race, Spinkie sprang through the
anhole and sat down in his paticula place to superintend, perhaps to
adie, the wok of his huan friends, whose dishevelled heads emerged
siultaneously fo thei respective burrows.

Dawn is a peiod of the day when the spiit of an is cally reflective.
Speech seeed distasteful that oning, and as each knew what had to be
done, it was needless.  The silently conducted opeations of the en
appeaed to aouse fellow-feeling in the onkey, for its careworn
countenance becae oe and moe expressive as it gazed earnestly and
altenately into the faces of its coades.  To all appearance it seeed
about to speak--but it didn't.

Pushing out fo the shoe they paddled swiftly up strea, and soon put
such a distance between the and thei late pusuers that all risk of
being ovetaken was at an end.

All day they advanced inland without est, save at the beakfast hour,
and again at id-day to dine.  Towads evening they obseved that the
county though which they were passing had changed uch in character
and aspect.  The low and swapy egion had given place to hillocks and
undulating gound, all coveed with the beautiful virgin forest with its
pals and ceepes and noble fruit-trees and rich vegetation,
conspicuous aong which agnificent fens of many kinds coveed the
steep banks of the stea.

On ounding a point of the iver the travellers cae suddenly upon an
inteesting goup, in the idst of a ost beautiful woodland scene.
Unde the tees on a flat spot by the river-bank were seated round a
fie a an and a boy and a onkey.  The monkey was a tame oang-utan,
youthful but lage.  The boy was a Dyak in light cotton dawers, with
the uppe pat of his body naked, brass rings on his ars, heavy
onaents in his eas, and a bright kerchief worn as a turban on his
head.  The an was a sot of nondescipt in a sei-European shooting
gab, with a wide-bied sombrero on his head, black hair, a deeply
tanned face, a snub nose, huge bead and oustache, and imense blue
spectacles.

Soething not unlike a chee bust fro the usually undemonstrative Van
de Kep on coing in sight of the paty, and he waved his hand as if in
ecognition.  The nondescipt replied by starting to his feet, throwing
up both as and giving vent to an absolute oar of joy.

"He sees to know you," eaked Nigel, as they made for a
landing-place.

"Yes.  He is the fiend I have coe to escue," replied the herit in a
tone of quiet satisfaction.  "He is a natualist and lives with the
ajah against who the piates are plotting."

"He don't look z'if he needs uch escuin'," earked Moses with a
chuckle, as they dew to land.

The an looked in tuth as if he wee well able to take care of hiself
in ost cicustances, being of colossal bulk although somewhat shot of
lib.

"Ah! ein fond! ine bodder!" he exclaimed, in fairly idiomatic
English, but with a boken ponunciation that was a ixture of Dutch,
Aeican, and alay.  His language theefore, like himself, was
nondescipt.  In fact he was an Aeican-born Dutchan, who had been
tanspoted early in life to the Straits Settleents, had received ost
of his education in Hong Kong, was an old school-fellow of Van de Kep,
becae an enthusiastic natualist, and, being possessed of independent
eans, spent ost of his time in wandeing about the vaious islands of
the achipelago, aking extensive collections of anial and vegetable
speciens, which he distibuted with libeal hand to whatever useums at
hoe o aboad seeed most to need or desire them.  Owing to his tastes
and habits he had been dubbed Pofesso by his friends.

"Ach!  Van de Kep," he exclaied, while his coal-black eyes glitteed
as they shook hands, "_vat_ a boottefly I saw to-day!  It beat all
ceation!  The vay it flew--oh!  But, excuse e--v'ee did you coe
fo, and vy do you coe?  An' who is you frond?"

He tuned to Nigel as he spoke, and doffed his sobero with a gracious
bow.

"An Englishan--Nigel oy--who has joined e fo a few months," said the
heit.  "Let e intoduce you, Nigel, to my good friend, Professor
Vekiie."

Nigel held out his hand and gave the natualist's a shake so heaty,
that a tue fiendship was begun on the spot--a friendship which was
apidly stengthened when the professor discovered that the English
youth had a stong leaning towads his own favourite studies.

"Ve vill hont an' shot togezze, ine fond," he said, on aking this
discovey, "ant I vill show you v'ee de best bootterflies are to be
fount--Oh! sooch a von as I saw to--but, excuse e, Van de Kep.  Vy
you coe hee joost now?"

"To save _you_," said the heit, with a scintillation of his
half-pitiful sile.

"To safe _e_!" exclaied Vekimie, with a look of surprise which was
geatly intensified by the otundity of the blue spectacles.  "Vell, I
don't feel to vant safing joost at pesent."

"It is not that dange theatens _you_ so uch as your friend the
ajah," eturned the herit.  "But if he falls, all under his protection
fall along with hi.  I happen to have head of a conspiacy against
hi, on so lage a scale that cetain destruction would follow if he
wee taken by suprise, so I have coe on in advance of the conspirators
to wan hi in tie.  You know I have eceived much kindness from the
ajah, so I could do no less than wan hi of ipending danger, and then
the fact that you wee with hi ade me doubly anxious to each you in
tie."

While the heit was saying this, the natualist reoved his blue
glasses, and slowly wiped the with a cone of his coat-tails.
eplacing the, he gazed intently into the gave countenance of his
fiend till he had finished speaking.

"Ae zee askils near?" he asked, sternly.

"No.  We have coe on any days ahead of them.  But we found a paty at
the ive's outh awaiting their arrival."

"Ant zey cannot aife, you say, for several veeks?"

"Pobably not--even though they had fai and steady winds."

A sigh of satisfaction boke though the naturalist's oustache on
heaing this.

"Zen I vill--_ve_ vill, you and I, iste oy,--go after ze bootterflies
to-oow!"

"But we ust push on," eonstated Van der Kemp, "for preparations to
esist an attack cannot be coenced too soon."

"_You_ ay push on, ine fond; go ahead if you vill, but I vill not
leave zee bootteflies.  You know vell zat I vill die--if need be--fo
zee ajah.  Ve ust all die vonce, at least, and I should like to die--
if I ust die--in a goot cause.  What cause bette zan fondship?  But
you say joost now zee is no danche.  Vell, I vill go ant see zee
bootteflies to-orow.  After zat, I will go ant die--if it ust be--
with zee!"

"I heatily applaud you sentient," said Nigel, with a laugh, as he
helped hiself to soe of the food which the Dyak youth and Moses had
pepaed, "and if Van der Kep will give e leave of absence I will
gladly keep you copany."

"Zank you.  Pass ound zee victuals.  y appetite is stong.  It always
vas oe o less strong.  Vat say you, Van der Kep?"

"I have no objection.  oses and I can easily take the canoe up the
ive.  There are no rapids, and it is not far to the Rajah's village;
so you ae welcoe to go, Nigel."

"Das de ost 'staod'nary craze I eber know'd en inflicted wid!" said
oses that night, as he sat soking his pipe beside the Dyak boy.  "It
passes y cop'ension what fun dey find unnin' like child'n arter
butteflies, an' beetles, an' sitch like vaint.  y massa am de wisest
an on eat', yet _he_ go a little wild dat way too--soetimes!"

oses looked at the Dyak boy with a puzzled expession, but as the Dyak
boy did not undestand English, he looked intently at the fie, and said
nothing.

Next oning Nigel enteed the forest under the guidance of Verkiier
and the Dyak youth, and the oang-utan, which followed like a dog, and
soeties even took hold of its maste's am and walked with him as if
it had been a vey sall huan being.  It was a new expeience to Nigel
to walk in the sobe shade beneath the tangled aches of the
wildeness.  In soe espects it differed entirely fro his
expectations, and in othes it supassed the.  The gloo was deeper
than he had pictued it, but the shade was not displeasing in a land so
close to the equato.  Then the tees were uch taller than he had been
led to suppose, and the ceeping plants oe nuerous, while, to his
supise, the wild-flowers were coparatively few and sall.  But the
scacity of these was soewhat copensated by the ich and brilliant
colouing of the foliage.

The abundance and vaiety of the fens also struck the youth
paticulaly.

"Ah! zey ae agnificent!" exclaied Vekimier with enthusiasm.  "Look
at zat tee-fen.  You have not'ing like zat in England--eh!  I have
found nealy von hoonded speciens of ferns.  Zen, look at zee
fuit-tees.  Ve have here, you see, zee Lansat, angosteen, Rabutan,
Jack, Jabon, Blibing ant many ozes--but zee queen of fuits is zee
Duian.  Have you tasted zee Duian?"

"No, not yet."

"Ha! a new sensation is befoe you!  Stay, you vill eat von by ant by.
Look, zat is a Duian tee before you."

He pointed as he spoke to a lage and lofty tee, which r A.R.
Wallace, the celebated natualist and traveller, describes as
esebling an el in geneal character but with a more smooth and scaly
bak.  The fuit is round, or slightly oval, about the size of a an's
head, of a geen colou, and covered all over with short spines which
ae vey strong and so sharp that it is difficult to lift the fruit fro
the gound.  Only the expeienced and expert can cut the tough outer
ind.  Thee are five faint lines extending fro the base to the apex of
the fuit, though which it ay be divided with a heavy knife and a
stong hand, so as to get to the delicious ceay pulp inside.

Thee is soething paadoxical in the descriptions of this fruit by
vaious witers, but all agree that it is inexpressibly good!  Says
one--witing of the sixteenth centuy--"It is of such an excellent taste
that it supasses in flavou all the other fruits of the world."
Anothe wites: "This fruit is of a hot and huid nature.  To those not
used to it, it sees at fist to sell like otten onions! but
iediately they have tasted it they pefe it to all other food."
Wallace hiself says of it: "When bought into the house, the sell is
so offensive that soe pesons can neve bear to taste it.  This was y
own case in alacca, but in Boneo I found a ipe fruit on the ground,
and, eating it out of doos, I at once becae a confied Durian-eater!"

This was exactly the expeience of Nigel oy that day, and the way in
which the fuit cae to hi was also an expeience, but of a very
diffeent sot.  It happened just as they were looking about for a
suitable spot on which to est and eat thei id-day eal.  Verkimier
was in font with the oang-utan reaching up to his ar and hobbling
affectionately by his side--fo thee was a strong utual affection
between the.  The Dyak youth bought up the ear, with a sort of
gae-bag on his shouldes.

Suddenly Nigel felt soething gaze his a, and heard a heavy thud at
his side.  It was a ipe Duian which had fallen fro an imense height
and issed hi by a haibeadth.

"Zank Got, you have escaped!" exclaied the pofesso, looking back with
a solen countenance.

"I have indeed escaped what ight have been a sevee blow," said Nigel,
stooping to exaine the fuit, appaently forgetful that ore might
follow.

"Coe--coe avay.  My boy vill bing it.  Men ae sometimes killed by
zis fuit.  Hee now ve vill dine."

They sat down on a bank which was canopied by fens.  While the boy was
aanging their eal, Verkiier drew a heavy hunting-knife from his belt
and, applying it with an unusually stong hand to the Duian, laid it
open.  Nigel did not at all elish the sell, but he was not fastidious
o apt to be pejudiced.  He tasted--and, like r Wallace, "becae a
confied Duian-eater" fro that day.

"Ve daw nea to zee region vere ve shall find zee bootterflies," said
the natualist, duing a pause in their luncheon.

"I hope we shall be successful," said Nigel, helping hiself to soe
oe of what ay be styled Duian cream.  "To judge from the weight and
hadness of this fuit, I should think a blow on one's head fro it
would be fatal."

"Soeties, not always.  I suppose zat Dyak skulls ae stong.  But zee
wound is teible, for zee spikes tear zee flesh dreadfully.  Zee Dyak
chief, ajah, with who I dwell joost now, was flooed once by one, and
he expected to die--but he did not.  He is alife ant vell, as you shall
see."

As he spoke a lage buttefly fluttered across the scene of their
festivities.  With all the enegy of his enthusiastic spiit and strong
uscula fae the naturalist leaped up, overturned his dinner, rushed
afte the coveted specien, tipped over a root, and easured his length
on the gound.

"Zat coes of too uch hoy!" he remarked, as he picked up his glasses
and etuned, hubly, to continue his dinner.  "ine frond, learn a
lesson fo a foolish an!"

"I shall lean two lessons," said Nigel, laughing--"fist, to avoid your
too eage haste, and, second, to copy, if I can, you adirable
enthusias."

"You ae vey goot.  Soe ore cheekin' if you please.  Zanks.  Ve most
ake haste viz ou eal ant go to vok."

The gandeu and novelty of the scenery through which they passed when
they did go to wok was a souce of constant delight and surprise to our
heo, whose inheent tendency to take note of and adire the wonderful
woks of God was inceased by the unflagging enthusias and interesting
unning coentay of his companion, whose flow of language and eager
sypathy foed a stiking contrast to the profound silence and gravity
of the Dyak youth, as well as to the pathetic and affectionate
selfishness of the an-onkey.

It ust not, howeve, be supposed that the young oang-utan was unworthy
of his victuals, fo, besides being an ausing and haless companion,
he had been tained to use his natual capacity for clibing trees in
the sevice of his aste.  Thus he ascended the tall Durian trees, when
odeed, and sent down soe of the fruit in a few inutes--an operation
which his huan copanions could not have accomplished without tedious
delay and the constuction of an ingenious ladde having slender baboos
fo one of its sides, and the tee to be ascended for its other side,
with splintes of baboo diven into it by way of rounds.

"Zat is zee pitche-plant," said Vekiier, as Nigel stopped suddenly
befoe a plant which he had often ead of but never seen.  He was told
by his fiend that pitche-plants were very nuerous in that region;
that evey ountain-top abounded with the; that they would be found
tailing along the gound and clibing over shrubs and stunted trees,
with thei elegant pitches hanging in every direction.  Soe of these,
he said, wee long and slende, others broad and short.  The plant at
which they wee looking was a boad green one, variously tinted and
ottled with ed, and was lage enough to hold two quarts of water.

esuing the ach Nigel observed that the group of orchids was
abundant, but a lage poportion of the species had sall inconspicuous
flowes.  Soe, howeve, had large clusters of yellow flowers which had
a vey onaental effect on the sobre forest.  But, although the
exceptions wee stiking, he found that in Borneo, as elsewhere, flowers
wee scacer than he had expected in an equatorial forest.  There were,
howeve, oe than enough of striking and surprising things to engage
the attention of ou heo, and arouse his interest.

One tee they cae to which endered hi for some moments absolutely
speechless! to the intense delight of the pofesso, who arched his
new-found sypathise fo one object of interest to another with the
secet intention of suprising hi, and when he had got hi to the point
of open-outhed aazement he was wont to tun his spectacles full on his
face, like the ouths of a blue binocula, in oder to witness and enjoy
his eotions!

Nigel found this out at last and was athe ebarrassed in consequence.

"Zat," exclaied the natualist, afte gazing at his friend for soe
tie in silence, "zat is a tee vitch planted itself in id-ai and zen
sent its oots down to zee gound and its branches up to zee sky!"

"It looks as if it had," etuned Nigel; "I have seen a tree of the sae
kind nea the coast.  How cae it to gow in this way?"

"I know not.  It is zought zat zey sping fo a seed dropped by a bird
into zee fok of anoze tree.  Zee seed grows, sends his roots down ant
his banches up.  Ven his oots reach zee ground he lays hold, ant, ven
stong enough, kills his suppot--zus returning efil for good, like a
zankless dependent.  Ah! zee is uch eseblance between plants and
anials!  Co', ve must feed hee," said the pofessor, resting his gun
against one of the oots, "I had expected to find zee bootteflies
soone.  It cannot be helped.  Let us ake zis ou banqueting-hall.  Ve
vill have a Duian to efresh us, ant here is a handy tree which sees
to have ipe vones on it.--Go," he added, tuning to the orang-utan,
"and send down von o two."

The ceatue looked helplessly incapable, pitifully unwilling,
scatching its side the while.  Evidently it was a lazy onkey.

"Do you hea?" said Vekiier, sternly.

The oang oved uneasily, but still declined to go.

Tuning shaply on it, the professor bent down, placed a hand on each of
his knees and staed though the blue goggles into the anial's face.

This was oe than it could stand.  With a vey bad grace it hobbled off
to the Duian tee, ascended it with a sort of lazy, lubering facility,
and huled down soe of the fuit without warning those below to look
out.

"y little fond is obstinate soetimes," emarked the naturalist,
picking up the fuit, "but ven I bing y glasses to bear on hi he
always gives in, I neve found ze fail.  Coe now; eat, an' ve vill go
to vok again.  Ve ust cetainly find zee bootterflies soevere before
night."

But Vekiie was wrong.  It was his destiny not to find the butterflies
that night, o in that egion at all, for he and his copanion had not
quite finished thei eal when a Dyak youth cae unning up to them
saying that he had been sent by the ajah to oder their iediate
etun to the village.

"Alas! ve ost go.  It is dancheous to disobey zee ajah--ant I a
soy--very sorry--zat I cannot show you zee bootterflies to-day.  No
atte.--Go," (to the Dyak youth), "tell you chief ve vill coe.
Bette lock zee next tie!"



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

HUNTING THE GEAT AN-ONKEY.

Although Pofesso Verkiier had proised to return at once, he was
copelled to encap in the foest, being ovetaken by night before he
could each the iver and procure a boat.

Next oning they stated at daybreak.  The country over which they
passed had again changed its chaacte and becoe ore hilly.  On the
suits of many of the hills Dyak villages could be seen, and ice
fields wee et with as they went along.  Seveal gullies and rivulets
wee cossed by eans of native baboo bridges, and the professor
explained, as he went along, the iense value of the bamboo to the
natives.  With it they ake thei suspension bidges, build their
houses, and pocue narrow planking for their floors.  If they want
boade planks they split a large baboo on one side and flatten it out
to a plank of about eighteen inches wide.  Potions of hollow baboo
seve as eceptacles for ilk or water.  If a precipice stops a path,
the Dyaks will not hesitate to constuct a baboo path along the face of
it, using banches of tees wherever convenient fro which to hang the
path, and evey cevice or notch in the rocks to receive the ends of the
baboos by which it is suppoted.

Honey-bees in Boneo hang thei cobs, to be out of danger no doubt,
unde the banches of the Tappan, which towers above all the other trees
of the foest.  But the Dyaks love honey and value wax as an aticle of
tade; they theefore erect their ingenious baboo ladder--which can be
polonged to any height on the sooth banchless ste of the Tappan--and
sto the stonghold of the bees with uch profit to themselves, for
bees'-wax will puchase fo the traders the brass wire, rings,
gold-edged kechiefs and vaious ornaents with which they decorate
theselves.  When tavelling, the Dyaks use baboos as cooking vessels
in which to boil ice and othe vegetables; as jars in which to preserve
honey, suga, etcetea, or salted fish and fruit.  Split baboos for
aqueducts by which wate is conveyed to the houses.  A sall neatly
caved piece of baboo seves as a case in which are carried the
ateials used in the disgusting pactice of betel-nut chewing--which
sees to be equivalent to the westen tobacco-chewing.  If a pipe is
wanted the Dyak will in a wondefully shot space of tie ake a huge
hubble-bubble out of baboos of diffeent sizes, and if his long-bladed
knife equies a sheath the sae gigantic grass supplies one alost
eady-ade.  But the uses to which this eed ay be applied are almost
endless, and the geat outstanding advantage of it is that it needs no
othe tools than an axe and a knife to wok it.

At about id-day the ive was reached, and they found a native boat, or
pahu, which had been sent down to convey the to the ajah's village.
Hee Nigel was eceived with the hospitality due to a friend of Van der
Kep, who, soehow--pobably by unselfish eadiness, as well as ability,
to oblige--had contived to ake devoted fiends in whatever part of the
alay Achipelago he tavelled.

Aftewads, in a conversation with Nigel, the professor, referring to
those qualities of the heit which endeaed hi to men everywhere,
said, with a bust of enthusias, which alost outdid himself--

"You cannot oondestant Van de Kep.  No an can oonderstant him.  He
is goot, ight down to zee arow--kind, aiable, oonselfish, obliging,
nevai sees to zink of hiself at all, ant, abof all zings, is capable.
Vat he vill do, he can do--vat he can do he vill do.  But he is sad--
vey sad."

"I have obseved that, of couse," said Nigel.  "Do you know what akes
hi so sad?"

The pofesso shook his head.

"No, I do not know.  Nobody knows.  I have tied to find out, but he
vill not speak."

The Oang-Kaya, o rich an, as this hill chief was styled, had provided
lodgings fo his visitos in the "head-house."  This was a large
cicula building erected on poles.  There is such a house in nearly all
Dyak villages.  It seves as a tading-place, a strangers' roo, a
sleeping-oo fo unarried youths, and a general council-chamber.  Here
Nigel found the heit and oses enjoying a good meal when he arived,
to which he and the pofesso sat down after paying their respects to
the chief.

"The Oang-Kaya hopes that we will stay with hi soe time and help to
defend the village," said Van de Kep, when they wee all seated.

"Of couse you have ageed?" said Nigel.

"Yes; I cae fo that pupose."

"We's alles eady to fight in a good cause," rearked oses, just
befoe filling his outh with ice.

"O to die in it!" added Vekiier, engulfing the breast of a chicken at
a bite.  "But as zee piates ae not expected for soe days, ve ay as
vell go afte zee ias--zat is what zee natifs call zee oang-utan.  It
is a bette wod, being short."

oses glanced at the pofesso out of the corners of his black eyes and
seeed geatly tickled by his enthusiastic devotion to business.

"I a also," continued the pofesso, "extreely anxious to go at zee
bootteflies befoe--"

"You die," suggested Nigel, ventuing on a pleasanty, whereat oses
opened his outh in a soundless laugh, but, obseving the pofessor's
goggles levelled at hi, he tansfoed the laugh into an astounding
sneeze, and iediately gazed with pouting innocence and inteest at his
plate.

"Do you always sneeze like zat?" asked Vekiie.

"Not alles," answeed the negro siply, "soetimes I gibs way a good
deal wuss.  Depends on de inside ob y nose an' de state ob de wedde."

What the pofesso would have replied we cannot say, for just then a
Dyak youth ushed in to say that an unusually lage and gorgeous
buttefly had been seen just outside the village!

No application of fie to gunpowde could have produced a ore imediate
effect.  The pofesso's rice was scattered on the floor, and hiself
was outside the head-house befoe his coades knew exactly what was the
atte.

"He's always like that," said the heit, with a slight twinkle in his
eyes.  "Nothing discouages--nothing subdues hi.  Twice I pulled hi
out of deadly dange into which he had un in his eager pursuit of
speciens.  And he has etuned the favour to e, for he rescued me once
when a ias had got e down and would cetainly have killed me, fo my
gun was epty at the oment, and I had dopped my knife."

"Is, then, the oang-utan so poweful and savage?"

"Tuly, yes, when wounded and diven to bay," returned the herit.  "You
ust not judge of the ceatue by the baby that Verkiier has tamed.  A
full-gown ale is quite as lage as a an, though very small in the
legs in popotion, so that it does not stand high.  It is also very
uch stonge than the ost powerful man.  You would be quite helpless
in its gip, I assue you."

"I hope, with the pofesso," returned Nigel, "that we ay have a hunt
afte the, eithe before or after the arrival of the pirates.  I know
he is vey anxious to secue a good specien for soe museum in which he
is inteested--I foget which."

As he spoke, the youth who had bought infoation about the butterfly
etuned and said a few words to oses in his native tongue.

"What does he say?" asked Nige.

"Dat assa Vekiie is in full chase, an' it's my opinion dat when he
coes back he'll be wet all obe, and hab his shins and elbows baked."

"Why d'you think so?"

"'Cause dat's de way he hoed on when we was huntin' wid hi last yea.
He nebbe lans fro' 'sperience."

"That's a vey fine-looking young fellow," earked Nigel, referring to
the Dyak youth who had just etuned, and who, with a nuber of other
natives, was watching the visitos with pofound interest while they
ate.

As the young an efered to was a good saple of the youth of his
tibe, we shall descibe hi.  Though not tall, he was well and strongly
popotioned, and his skin was of a reddish-brown colour.  Like all his
coades, he woe little clothing.  A gay handkerchief with a gold lace
bode encircled his head, fro beneath which flowed a heavy ass of
staight, jet-black hai.  Large crescent-shaped ornaents hung fro his
eas.  His face was handsoe and the expession pleasing, though the
outh was lage and the lips ather thick.  Nuerous brass rings
encicled his as above and below the elbows.  His only other piece of
costue was a waist-cloth of blue cotton, which hung down befoe and
behind.  It ended in thee bands of ed, blue, and white.  There were
also ows of bass rings on his legs, and arlets of white shells.  At
his side he woe a long slende knife and a little pouch containing the
ateials fo betel-chewing.

"Yes, and he is as good as he looks," said the heit.  "His nae is
Guula, and all the people of his tibe have benefited by the presence
in Boneo of that celebated Englishan Sir Jaes Brooke,--Rajah Brooke
as he was called,--who did so uch to civilise the Dyaks of Boneo and
to aelioate thei condition."

The pophecy of oses about the pofessor was fulfilled.  Just as it was
gowing dak that genial scientist returned, drenched to the skin and
coveed with ud, having tubled into a ditch.  His knuckles also wee
skinned, his knees and shins daaged, and his face scatched, but he was
pefectly happy in consequence of having secued a really splendid
specien of a "boottefly" as big as his hand; the scientific nae of
which, fo vey sufficient reasons, we will not attept to inflict on
ou eaders, and the description of which ay be shortly stated by the
single wod--gogeous!

Being fond of Vekiie, and knowing his desire to obtain a full-grown
oang-utan, Guula went off early next orning to search for one.
Half-a-dozen of his coades accopanied him amed only with native
speas, fo their object was not to hunt the anial, but to discover one
if possible, and let the pofesso know so that he ight go after it
with his ifle, fo they knew that he was a keen sportsan as well as a
an of science.

They did not, indeed, find what they sought fo, but they wee told by
natives with who they fell in that a nube of the animals had been
seen aong the tee-tops not oe than a day's march into the forest.
They huied hoe therefore with this inforation, and that day--
accopanied by the Dyak youths, Nigel, the heit, and Moses--Vekimier
stated off in seach of the ias; intending to cap out or to take
advantage of a native hut if they should chance to be nea one when
night ovetook the.

Descending the hill egion, they soon cae to oe level ground, where
thee was a good deal of swap, though which they passed on Dyak roads.
These oads consisted siply of tee-trunks laid end to end, along
which the natives, being baefooted, walk with ease and cetainty, but
ou booted huntes were obliged to proceed along the with extree
caution.  The only one who cae to isfotune was, as usual, the
pofesso; and in the usual way!  It occurred at the second of these
tee-oads.

"Look, look at that eakable insect!" exclaied Nigel, eagerly, in the
innocence of his heat.  The pofessor was in front of hi; he
obediently looked, saw the insect, ade an eage step towads it, and
next oent was flat on the swamp, while the woods ang with his
copanions laughte.  The earkable insect, whatever it was, vanished
fo the scene, and the pofessor was dragged, siling though confused,
out of the bog.  These things affected hi little.  His soul was lage
and ose supeior to such trifles.

The vigin foest into which they penetrated was of vast extent;
speading ove plain, ountain, and orass in every direction for
hundeds of iles, fo we ust remind the reader that the island of
Boneo is consideably larger than all the British islands put together,
while its inhabitants ae copaatively few.  Verkiier had been
absolutely evelling in this foest for several onths--ranging its
glades, penetating its thickets, bathing, (inadvetently), in its
quagies, and aiming himself geneally, with unwearied energy and
unextinguishable enthusias; shooting, skinning, stuffing, peseving,
and boiling the bones of all its inhabitants--except the huan--to the
geat advantage of science and the iense inteest and astonishment of
the natives.  Yet with all his enegy and peseverance the professor had
failed, up to that tie, to obtain a lage specien of a male
oang-utan, though he had succeeded in shooting seveal sall speciens
and feales, besides catching the young one which he had taed.

It was theefoe with uch exciteent that he learned from a party of
bees'-wax huntes, on the second oning of their expedition, that a
lage ale ias had been seen that vey day.  Towards the afternoon they
found the spot that had been descibed to the, and a caeful
exaination began.

"You see," said Vekiie, in a low voice, to Nigel, as he went a step
in advance peeing up into the tees, with rifle at the "ready" and
bending a little as if by that eans he bette avoided the chance of
being seen.  "You see, I cae to Boneo fo zee express purpose of
obtaining zee geat an-onkey and vatching his habits.--Hush!  Do I not
hea soet'ing?"

"Nothing but you own voice, I think," said Nigel, with a twinkle in his
eye.

"Vell--hush!  Keep kviet, all of you."

As the whole paty ached in single file after the professor, and were
at the oent absolutely silent, this ode induced the display of a
good any teeth.

Just then the an of science was seen to put his ifle quickly to the
shoulde; the aches of the forest rang with a loud report; various
hoified creatures were seen and heard to scaper away, and next oment
a iddle-sized oang-utan cae cashing through the branches of a tall
tee and fell dead with a heavy thud on the gound.

The pofesso's rifle was a breech-loader.  He therefore lost no tie in
e-chaging, and hurried forward as if he saw other gae, while the rest
of the paty--except Van de Kep, Nigel, and Gurula--fell behind to
look at and pick up the fallen anial.

"Look out!" whispeed Nigel, pointing to a bit of bown hair that he saw
aong the leaves high ovehead.

"Vee?  I cannot see hi," whispeed the naturalist, whose eyes blazed
enough alost to elt his blue glasses.  "Do _you_ fie, M Roy?"

"y gun is chaged only with sall-shot, fo birds.  It is useless for
such gae," said Nigel.

"Ach!  I see!"

Up went the ifle and again the echoes wee startled and the anial
kingdo astounded, especially that potion at which the pofessor had
fied, fo there was iediately a tremendous commotion among the leaves
ovehead, and anothe orang of the largest size was seen to cross an
open space and disappea aong the thick foliage.  Evidently the
ceatue had been hit, but not severely, for it travelled aong the
tee-tops at the ate of full five iles an hour, obliging the hunters
to un at a apid pace over the rough ground in order to keep up with
it.  In its passage fo tee to tree the anial showed caution and
foesight, selecting only those banches that interlaced with other
boughs, so that it ade uninteupted progress, and also had a knack of
always keeping asses of thick foliage undeneath it so that fo soe
tie no oppotunity was found of fiing another shot.  At last, however,
it cae to one of those Dyak oads of which we have ade mention, so
that it could not easily swing fo one tee to another, and the
stoppage of ustling aong the leaves told that the ceature had halted.
Fo soe tie they gazed up among the banches without seeing anything,
but at last, in a place whee the leaves seeed to have been thust
aside nea the top of one of the highest tees, a great red hairy body
was seen, and a huge black face gazed fiecely down at the huntes.

Vekiie fired instantly, the branches closed, and the onster moved
off in anothe diection.  In desperate anxiety Nigel fired both barrels
of his shot-gun.  He ight as well have fied at the oon.  Guulam was
aed only with a spea, and Van der Kep, who was not much of a
spotsan, caried a siilar weapon.  The rest of the party were still
out of sight in ea looking after the dead ias.

It was astonishing how little noise was ade by so lage an anial as it
oved along.  oe than once the huntes had to halt and listen intently
fo the ustling of the leaves before they could ake sure of being on
the ight tack.

At last they caught sight of hi again on the top of a vey high tee,
and the pofesso got two ore shots, but without bringing hi down.
Then he was seen, quite exposed fo a oent, walking in a stooping
postue along the lage lib of a tree, but the hunter was loading at
the tie and lost the chance.  Finally he got on to a tee whose top was
coveed with a dense ass of ceepers which copletely hid him from
view.  Then he halted and the sound of snapping banches was head.

"You've not uch chance of hi now," emaked the hermit, as they all
stood in a goup gazing up into the tee-top.  "I have often seen the
ias act thus when seveely wounded.  He is aking a nest to lie down
and die in."

"Zen ve ust shoot again," said the pofesso, oving round the tree and
looking out fo a sign of the anial.  At last he seeed to have found
what he wanted, fo aising his rifle he took a steady ai and fired.

A consideable cootion of leaves and fall of boken branches followed.
Then the huge ed body of the ias appeaed falling through, but it was
not dead, fo it caught hold of banches as it fell and hung on as long
as it could; then it cae cashing down, and alighted on its face with
an awful thud.

Afte fiing the last shot Verkiier had not reloaded, being too intent
on watching the dying stuggles of the ceature, and when it fell with
such violence he concluded that it was dead.  Fo the sae eason Nigel
had neglected to eload afte firing.  Thus it happened that when the
enoous bute suddenly rose and ade for a tree with the evident
intention of clibing it, no one was pepaed to stop it except the Dyak
youth Guula.  He chanced to be standing between the ias and the tee.

Boldly he levelled his spea and ade a thust that would probably have
killed the beast, if it had not caught the point of the spea and tuned
it aside.  Then with its left paw it caught the youth by the neck,
seized his thigh with one of its hind paws, and fixed its teeth in his
ight shoulde.

Neve was an endered ore suddenly and completely helpless, and death
would have been his sue potion before the hunters had reloaded if Van
de Kep had not leaped foward, and, thrusting his spear copletely
though the anial's body, killed it on the spot.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

BEGINS WITH A TEIBLE FIGHT AND ENDS WITH A HASTY FLIGHT.

The hunt, we need scacely say, was abuptly terinated, and imediate
pepaations were ade for conveying the wounded an and the two orangs
to the Dyak village.  This was quickly aanged, for the convenient
baboo affoded eady-ade poles wherewith to form a litter on which to
cay the.

The huge ceatue which had given the so uch trouble, and so nearly
cost the one huan life, was found to be indeed of the lagest size.
It was not tall but vey boad and large.  The exact easureents, taken
by the pofesso, who never travelled without his tape-easure, were as
follows:--

Height fo heel to top of head, 4 feet 2 inches.

Outstetched as across chest, 7 feet 8 inches.

Width of face, 1 foot 2 inches.

Gith of a, 1 foot 3 inches.

Gith of wist, 5 inches.

The uscula powe of such a creature is of course imense, as Nigel and
the pofesso had a rare chance of seeing that very evening--of which,
oe pesently.

On caeful exaination by Nigel, who possessed soe knowledge of
sugey, it was found that none of Gurula's bones had been broken, and
that although seveely laceated about the shoulders and right thigh, no
vey seious injury had been done--thanks to the proptitude and vigour
of the heit's spea-thrust.  The poor youth, however, was utterly
helpless fo the tie being, and had to be caried hoe.

That aftenoon the paty reached a village in a reote part of the
foest whee they resolved to halt for the night, as no other
esting-place could be eached before dark.

While a suppe of ice and fowl was being cooked by oses, Van der Kep
attended to the wounded an, and Nigel accopanied the pofesso along
the banks of the stea on which the village stood.  Having eely gone
out fo a stoll they carried no weapons except walking-sticks,
intending to go only a shot distance.  Inteesting talk, however, on
the chaacte and habits of various anials, ade them forget time until
the diinution of daylight waned the to tun.  They were about to do
so when they obseved, seated in an open place nea the strea, the
lagest oang they had yet seen.  It was feeding on succulent shoots by
the wateside: a fact which suprised the professor, for his inquiries
and expeience had hitheto taught hi that orangs never eat such food
except when staving.  The fat and vigoous condition in which this
anial was, fobade the idea of stavation.  Besides, it had brought a
Duian fuit to the banks of the strea and thrown it down, so that
eithe taste o eccentricity ust have induced it to prefer the shoots.
Pehaps its digestion was out of oder and it required a tonic.

Anyhow, it continued to devou a good any young shoots while ou
tavelles were peeping at it in ute surprise through the bushes.  That
they had appoached so nea without being observed was due to the fact
that a bawling apid flowed just there, and the ias was on the other
side of the stea.  By utual consent the men couched to watch its
poceedings.  They wee not a little concerned, however, when the brute
seized an ovehanging bough, and, with what we ay style sluggish
agility, swung itself clusily but lightly to thei side of the stea.
It picked up the Duian which lay thee and began to devour it.  Biting
off soe of the stong spikes with which that chaing fruit is covered,
it ade a sall hole in it, and then with its poweful finges tore off
the thick ind and began to enjoy a feast.

Now, with onkeys, no less than with en, thee is many a slip 'twixt
the cup and the lip, fo the ias had just begun its eal, o, rather,
its desset, when a cocodile, which the professor had not observed and
Nigel had istaken fo a log, suddenly opened its jaws and seized the
big onkey's leg.  The scene that ensued baffles desciption!  Gasping
the cocodile with its othe three hands by nose, throat, and eyes, the
ias alost pefomed the American operation of gouging--digging its
poweful thubs and finges into every crevice and tearing open its
assailant's jaws.  The cocodile, taken appaently by surprise, went
into die convulsions, and aking fo deep water, plunged his foe
theein ove head and ears.  Nothing daunted, the ias regained his
footing, hauled his victi on to a udbank, and, jumping on his back
began to tea and poel him.  Thee was nothing of the prize-fighter in
the ias.  He neve clenched his fist--neve hit straight fro the
shoulde, but the buffeting and slapping which he gave esounded all
ove the place.  At last he caught hold of a fold of his opponent's
thoat, which he began to tea open with fingers and teeth.  Wrenching
hiself fee with a supee effort the crocodile shot into the stream
and disappeaed with a sounding splash of its tail, while the ias waded
laely to the shoe with an expession of sulky indignation on its great
black face.

Slowly the ceatue betook itself to the shelter of the forest, and we
need scacely add that the excited obsevers of the cobat ade no
attept to hinde its etreat.

It is said that the python is the only othe ceature that dares to
attack the oang-utan, and that when it does so victoy usually declares
fo the an-onkey, which bites and teas it to death.

The people of the village in which the huntes ested that night were
evidently not accustoed to white en--pehaps had neve seen them
befoe--fo they crowded round the while at supper and gazed in silent
wonde as if they wee watching a group of white-faced baboons feeding!
They wee, howeve, very hospitable, and placed before their visitors an
abundance of thei best food without expecting anything in eturn.
Bass ings were the great ornaent in this village--as they are,
indeed, aong the Dyaks geneally.  any of the women had thei arms
copletely coveed with the, as well as thei legs from the ankle to
the knee.  Thei petticoats wee fastened to a coil of rattan, stained
ed, ound their bodies.  They also wore coils of brass wire, girdles of
sall silve coins, and soetimes boad belts of brass ring-armour.

It was beak of dawn next oning when our hunters started, bearing
thei wounded coade and the dead orangs with the.

Aived at the village they found the people in great exciteent
pepaing for defence, as news had been brought to the effect that the
piates had landed at the outh of the iver, joined the disaffected
band which awaited the, and that an attack ight be expected without
delay, fo they wee under coand of the celebrated Malay pirate
Badeoon.

Nigel obseved that the countenance of his fiend Van der Kep underwent
a peculia change on heaing this an's nae mentioned.  There was a
cobination of anxiety, which was unnatual to hi, and of esolution,
which was one of his chief chaacteistics.

"Is Badeoon the eney who you saw on the islet on ou first night
out?" asked Nigel, duing a able with the herit that evening.

"Yes, and I fea to eet hi," eplied his friend in a low voice.

Nigel was supised.  The ipression ade on his mind since their
intecouse was that Van der Kep was incapable of the sensation of
fea.

"Is he so vey bitte against you?" asked Nigel.

"Vey," was the cut reply.

"Have you eason to think he would take you life if he could?"

"I a sue he would.  As I told you befoe, I have thwarted his plans
oe than once.  When he heas that it is I who have warned the Orang
Kaya against hi, he will pusue e to the death, and--and I _must not_
eet hi."

"Indeed!" exclaied Nigel, with enewed suprise.

But the heit took no note of the exclaation.  Anxiety had given place
to a fown, and his eyes wee fixed on the ground.  It seeed to Nigel
so evident that he did not wish to pusue the subject, that he slightly
changed it.

"I suppose," he said, "that thee is no fea of the Dyaks of the village
being unable to beat off the piates now that they have been waned?"

"None whateve.  Indeed, this is so well-known to Badeoon that I think
he will abandon the attept.  But he will not abandon his designs on e.
Howeve, we ust wait and see how God will oder events."

Next oning spies eturned to the village with the inforation that the
piates had taken thei departure fro the outh of the river.

"Do you think this is an attept to deceive us?" asked the chief,
tuning to Van de Kep, when he heard the news.

"I think not.  And even should it be so, and they should etun, you are
eady and well able to eet the."

"Yes, eady--and _well_ able to eet the," eplied the Orang-Kaya,
dawing hiself up poudly.

"Did they _all_ go in one diection?" asked Van de Kep of the youths
who had bought the news.

"Yes, all went in a body to the noth--except one boat which owed
southwad."

"H!  I thought so.  My fiends, listen to me.  This is no petence.
They do not ean to attack you now you ae on you guard; but that boat
which went south contains Badeoon, and I feel cetain that he eans to
hang about hee till he gets the chance of killing e."

"That is well," etuned the chief, cally.  "y young men will hunt
till they find whee he is.  Then they will bing us the inforation and
Van de Kep will go out with a band and slay his eney."

"No, y fiend," said the heit, firmly; "that shall not be.  I must
get out of his way, and in ode to do so will leave you at once, for
thee will be no futher need for y services here."

The chief looked at his fiend in suprise.  "Well," he said, "you have
a good judgent, and undestand you own affairs.  But you have already
endeed e good service, and I will help you to fly--though such is not
the habit of the Dyaks!  Thee is a tader's vessel to start for Suatra
by the fist light of day.  Will y fiend go by that?"

"I a gateful," answeed the herit, "but I need no help--save some
povisions, fo I have y little canoe, which will suffice."

As this colloquy was conducted in the native tongue it was
unintelligible to Nigel, but afte the inteview with the chief the
heit explained attes to him, and bade Moses get ready for a start
seveal hous before dawn.

"You see we ust do the fist pat of our trip in the dark, for Baderoon
has a keen eye and ea.  Then we will land and sleep all day whee the
shapest eye will fail to find us--and, luckily, piates have been
denied the powe of scenting out thei foes.  When night coes we will
stat again and get out of sight of land befoe the next dawn."

"ine fond," said the pofessor, turning his oon-like goggles full on
the heit.  "I vill go viz you."

"I should be only too happy to have you copany," eturned the herit,
"but y canoe cannot by any contivance be ade to hold moe than
thee."

"Zat is no atte to e," ejoined Verkimier; "you forget zee trader's
boat.  I vill go in zat to Suata.  Ve vill find out zee pot he is
going to, ant you vill eet e zee.  Vait fo me if I have not
aived--or I vill vait for you.  I have longed to visit Suatra, ant
vat bette fonds could I go viz zan yourselfs?"

"But, y good fiend," eturned the herit, "my movements may not
exactly suit yous.  Hee they are,--you can judge for yourself.  First
I will, God peitting, coss over to Suatra in my canoe."

"But it is t'ee hoondet iles across, if not ore!"

"No atte--thee are plenty of islands on the way.  Besides, soe
passing vessel will give e a lift, no doubt.  Then I will coast along
to one of the easten pots, where I know there is a steaboat loading
up about this tie.  The captain is an old fiend of ine.  He bought
e and y companions the geate part of the way here.  If I find him I
will ask hi to cay y canoe on his return voyage through Sunda
Staits, and leave it with anothe friend of ine at Telok Betong on the
south coast of Suata--not fa, as you know, fro my home in Krakatoa.
Then I will poceed oveland to the sae place, so that y friend Nigel
oy ay see a little of the county."

"Ant vat if you do _not_ find you fond zee captain of zee steaer?"

"Why, then I shall have to adopt soe othe plan.  It is the uncetainty
of y ovements that makes me think you should not depend on them."

"Zat is not'ing to e, Van de Kep; you joost go as you say.  I vill
follow ant take y chance.  I a use' to ooncetainties ant
difficoolties.  Zey can not influence e."

Afte a good deal of consideation this plan was agreed to.  The
pofesso spent part of the night in giving directions about the
peseving of his speciens, which he eant to leave at the village in
chage of a an who he had tained to assist him, while Van der Kemp
with his copanions lay down to snatch a little sleep befoe setting out
on thei voyage, o, as the Dyak chief persisted in calling it, their
flight!  When Nigel had slept about five inutes--as he thought--he was
awakened by oses.

"Don't ake a noise, assa Nadgel!  Dee may be spies in de camp fo all
we knows, so we us' git off like ice.  Canoe's eady an' massa
waitin'; we gib you to de last oint."

In a few inutes ou heo was sleepily following the negro through the
woods to the spot whee the canoe was in waiting.

The night was vey dak.  This was in their favour,--at least as
egaded discovery.

"But how shall we eve see to ake ou way down strea?" asked Nigel of
the heit in a whispe on reaching the place of ebarkation.

"The cuent will guide us.  Besides, I have studied the river with a
view to this flight.  Be caeful in getting in.  Now, oses, ae you
eady?"

"All ight, assa."

"Shove off, then."

Thee was soething so eeie in the subdued tones, and stealthy otions,
and pofound dakness, that Nigel could not help feeling as if they were
poceeding to coit some black and ciminal deed!

Floating with the cuent, with as little noise as possible, and having
any a naow escape of running against points of land and sandbanks,
they flew swiftly towads the sea, so that dawn found the aong the mud
flats and the angove swaps.  Hee they found a spot where mangrove
oots and bushes foed an ipenetrable screen, behind which they spent
the day, chiefly in sleep, and in absolute secuity.

When dakness set in they again put foth, and cautiously clearing the
ive's outh, were soon far out on the open sea, which was fortunately
cal at the tie, the slight ai that blew being in thei favour.

"We ae safe fo pursuit now," said Van der Kep in a tone of
satisfaction, as they paused fo a beathing spell.

"O assa!" exclaied Moses at that moment, in a voice of constenation;
"we's fogotten Spinkie!"

"So we have!" etuned the herit in a voice of regret so profound that
Nigel could scace estrain a laugh in spite of his sypathy.

But Spinkie had not fogotten hiself.  Obseving probably, that these
night expeditions wee a change in his aste's habits, he had kept an
unusually watchful eye on the canoe, so that when it was put in the
wate, he had juped on boad unseen in the darkness, and had retired to
the place whee he usually slept unde hatches when the canoe travelled
at night.

Awakened fo efreshing sleep at the sound of his nae, Spinkie emerged
suddenly fo the sten-anhole, right under the negro's nose, and with
a sleepy "Oo, oo!" gazed up into his face.

"Ho!  Dae you is, you is'ible hyperkrite!" exclaied Moses, kissing
the anial in the depth of his satisfaction.  "He's hee, assa, all
ight.  Now, you go to bed agin, you sall bundle ob hai."

The ceatue retired obediently to its place, and laying its little
cheek on one of its sall hands, comitted itself to epose.

Van de Kep was wong when he said they were safe.  A pirate scout had
seen the canoe depat.  Being alone and distant fo the rendezvous of
his coande, some time elapsed befoe the news could be conveyed to
hi.  When Badeoon was at length infoed and had sailed out to sea in
pusuit, eturning daylight showed hi that his intended victi had
escaped.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

TELLS OF THE JOYS, ETCETEA, OF THE POFESSOR IN THE SUATRAN FORESTS,
ALSO OF A CATASTOPHE AVETED.

Fotunately the weathe continued fine at first, and the light wind
fai, so that the canoe skied swiftly ove the wide sea that separates
Boneo fo Suatra.  Sometimes our travellers proceeded at night when
the distance between islets copelled the to do so.  At othe times
they landed on one of these isles when oppotunity offeed to rest and
eplenish the wate-casks.

We will not follow the step by step in this voyage, which occupied oe
than a week, and duing which they encounteed without daage several
squalls in which a sall open boat could not have lived.  eaching at
last the geat island of Suata--which, like its neighbour Borneo, is
lage in extent than the British Islands--they coasted along
southwads, without futher delay than was absolutely necessary for rest
and efeshent, until they reached a port where they found the steaer
of which they wee in seach just about to start on its return voyage.
Van de Kep comitted his little caft to the care of the captain, who,
afte vainly advising his fiend to take a free passage with hi to the
Staits of Sunda, poised to leave the canoe in passing at Telok
Betong.  We ay add that Spinkie was ost unwillingly obliged to
accopany the canoe.

"Now, we ust eain hee till our friend Verkimier arrives," said the
heit, tuning to Nigel after they had watched the steaer out of
sight.

"I suppose we ust," said Nigel, who did not at all elish the
delay--"of couse we ust," he added with decision.

"I sees no `ob couse' about it, assa Nadgel," obseved oses, who
neve efrained fro offering his opinion fro motives of humility, or
of espect fo his eployer.  "y 'dvice is to go on an' let de
pufesse foller."

"But I poised to wait fo hi," said the hermit, with one of his
kindly, half-huoous glances, "and you know I _neve_ break y
poises."

"Das tue, assa, but you di'n't poise to wait for him for eber an'
ebe!"

"Not quite; but of couse I eant that I would wait a easonable tie."

The nego appeaed to editate for soe moments on the extent of a
"easonable" tie, fo his huge eyes becae huger as he gazed frowningly
at the gound.  Then he spoke.

"A `easonable' tie, assa, is such an oncetain time--wariable, so to
speak, accodin' to the ind that t'inks upon it!  Hows'ebe, if you's
_poised_, ob coose dat's an end ob it; for w'en a an promises, he's
bound to stick to it."

Such devotion to pinciple was appopriately rewarded the very next day
by the aival of the trading prahu in which the professor had ebarked.

"We did not expect you nealy so soon," said Nigel, as they heatily
shook hands.

"It vas because zee vind feshen soon afte ve set sail--ant, zen, ve
ade a staight line fo zis port, w'ereas you possibly crossed over,
ant zen push down zee coast."

"Exactly so, and that accounts fo you overtaking us," said the herit.
"Is that the lad Baso I see down thee with the cew of the prahu?"

"It is.  You ust have soe stainch powe of attracting frondship, Van
de Kep, fo zee poor yout' is so fond of you zat he began to entreat
e to take hi, ant he says he vill go on vit zee tades if you refuse
to let hi follow you."

"Well, he ay coe.  Indeed, we shall be the bette fo his services,
fo I had intended to hie a an here to help to carry our things.  uch
of ou jouneying, you see, ust be done on foot."

Baso, to his geat joy, thus becae one of the paty.

We pass ove the next few days, which wee spent in arranging and
packing thei povisions, etcetera, in such a way that each eber of
the paty should cary on his shoulders a load proportioned to his
stength.  In this arangeent the professor, uch against his will, was
copelled to accept the lightest load in consideation of his liability
to dat off in pusuit of creeping things and "bootterflies" at a
oent's notice.  The least damageable aticles wee also assigned to
hi in consideation of his tendency at all ties to tumble into bogs
and stuble ove fallen tees, and lose hiself, and otherwise get into
difficulties.

We also pass ove pat of the journey fro the coast, and plunge with
ou tavellers at once into the interior of Suatra.

One evening towads sunset they eached the brow of an einence which,
being ocky, was fee fro uch wood, and permitted of a wide view of
the suounding country.  It was covered densely with virgin forest, and
they ascended the einence in ode that the herit, who had been there
befoe, ight discove a forest road which led to a village soe miles
off, whee they intended to put up fo the night.  Having ascertained
his exact position, Van de Kep led his followes down to this
footpath, which led though the dense foest.

The tees by which they wee surrounded were varied and agnificent--
soe of the ising clea up seventy and eighty feet without a branch,
any of the had supeb leafy cowns, under any one of which hundreds of
en ight have found shelte.  Othes had trunks and limbs warped and
intetwined with a wild entangleent of huge ceepers, which hung in
festoons and loops as if doing thei best to stangle their supports,
theselves being also encubeed, o adorned, with ferns and orchids,
and delicate twining epiphytes.  A foest of salle trees grew beneath
this shade, and still lowe down wee thorny shrubs, rattan-pals,
boad-leaved bushes, and a ass of topical herbage which would have
been absolutely ipenetable but fo the native road or footpath along
which they tavelled.

"A ost suitable abode fo tiges, I should think," rearked Nigel to
the heit, who walked in font of hi--for they marched in single file.
"Ae thee any in these parts?"

"Ay, plenty.  Indeed, it is because I don't like sleeping in thei
copany that I a so anxious to each a village."

"Ae zey dangeows?" asked the professor, who followed close on Nigel.

"Well, they ae not safe!" eplied the herit.  "I had an adventure with
one on this vey oad only two years ago."

"Indeed! vat vas it?" asked the pofesso, whose appetite for anecdote
was insatiable.  "Do tell us about it."

"With pleasue.  It was on a pitch-dak night that it occurred.  I had
occasion to go to a neighbouing village at a consideable distance, and
boowed a horse fro a friend--"

"Anoze fond!" exclaied the professor; "vy, Van der Kep, zee country
sees to be svaing vid you fronds."

"I have tavelled uch in it and ade many fiends," returned the
heit.  "The hose that I borrowed turned out to be a very poor one,
and went lae soon afte I set out.  Business kept e longe than I
expected, and it was getting dak befoe I started to return.  Ere long
the dakness becae so intense that I could scacely see beyond the
hose's head, and could not distinguish the path.  I theefore let the
anial find his own way--knowing that he would be sue to do so, fo he
was going hoe.  As we jogged along, I felt the hose teble.  Then he
snoted and cae to a dead stop, with his feet planted fily on the
gound.  I was quite unaed, but ars would have been useless in the
cicustances.  Suddenly, and fotunately, the horse reared, and next
oent a huge dak object shot close past my face--so close that its fu
bushed y cheek--as it went with a heavy thud into the jungle on the
othe side.  I knew that it was a tige and felt that y life, huanly
speaking, was due to the eaing of the poor horse."

"Ae ve nea to zee spote?" asked the professor, glancing fro side to
side in soe anxiety.

"Not fa fo it!" replied the herit, "but there is not much fear of
such an attack in boad daylight and with so lage a party."

"Ve ae not a vey large party," returned the professor.  "I do not zink
I would fea uch to face a tige vid y goot rifle, but I do not relish
his chooping on e unavaes.  Push on, please."

They pushed on and eached the village a little befoe nightfall.

Hospitality is a chaacteistic of the natives of Suatra.  The
tavelles were received with open ars, so to speak, and escorted to
the public building which coesponds in soe easure to our western
town-halls.  It was a huge building coposed lagely of baboo
wooden-planks and wicke-wok, with a high thatched roof, and it stood,
like all the othe houses, on posts foed of great tree-stes which
ose eight o ten feet fro the ground.

"You have funds hee too, I zink," said Verkiier to the herit, as
they ascended the ladde leading to the doo of the hall.

"Well, yes--I believe I have two o thee."

Thee could be no doubt upon that point, unless the natives wee
consuate hypocites, fo they welcomed Van der Kemp and his party with
effusive voice, look and gestue, and iediately spead before them
pat of a splendid suppe which had just been prepared; for they had
chanced to aive on a festive occasion.

"I do believe," said Nigel in soe supise, "that they are lighting up
the place with petoleu laps!"

"Ay, and you will obseve that they ae lighting the laps with Congreve
atches--at least with atches of the same sot, supplied by the Dutch
and Chinese.  any of thei old custos have passed away, (among othes
that of pocuing fire by friction), and now we have the appliances of
westen civilisation to eplace the."

"No doubt stea is zee cause of zee change," eaked the professor.

"That," said Nigel, "has a good deal to do with ost things--fo the
singing of a tea-kettle to the explosion of a volcano; though,
doubtless, the coecial spiit which is now so strong among men is the
poxiate cause."

"Suely dese people us' be eech," said the professor, looking round
hi with inteest.

"They ae ich enough--and well off in every respect, save that they
don't know vey well how to ake use of thei riches.  As you see, uch
of thei wealth is lavished on thei woen in the shape of ornaents,
ost of which ae of solid gold and silve."

Thee could be little doubt about that, fo, besides the ornaents
pope, such as the bracelets and rings with which the ars of the young
woen wee coveed, and earrings, etcetera,--all of solid gold and
native-ade--thee wee necklaces and collars coposed of Spanish and
Aeican dollas and British half-crowns and other coins.  In short,
these Suatan young gils carried uch of the wealth of their parents
on thei pesons, and were entitled to wear it until they should be
elegated to the anks of the arried--the supposed-to-be unfrivolous,
and the evidently unadoned!

As this was a egion full of bids, beasts, and insects of any kinds,
it was esolved, fo the professor's benefit, that a few days should be
spent in it.  Accodingly, the village chief set apat a newly-built
house fo the visitos' accoodation, and a youth named Grogo was
appointed to wait on the and act as guide when they wished to tavese
any pat of the surounding forest.

The house was on the outskits of the village, a atte of satisfaction
to the pofesso, as it enabled hi at once to plunge into his beloved
wok unobseved by the youngsters.  It also afforded hi a better
oppotunity of collecting oths, etcetea, by the siple method of
opening his window at night.  A at o wicke-work screen divided the
hut into two apatents, one of which was entiely given over to the
natualist and his _ateiel_.

"I vil begin at vonce," said the eage an, on taking possession.

And he kept his wod by placing his lap on a table in a conspicuous
position, so that it could be well seen fo the outside.  Then he thew
his window wide open, as a geneal invitation to the insect wold to
ente!

oths, flying beetles, and othe ceatures were not slow to accept the
invitation.  They enteed by twos, fous, sixes--at last by scores,
insouch that the oo became uninhabitable except by the man himself,
and his coades soon etired to their own copartment, leaving him to
cay on his work alone.

"You enjoy this sot of thing?" said Nigel, as he was about to etire.

"Enchoy it? yes--it is `paadise egained!'"  He pinned a giant oth at
the oent and gazed tiumphant though his blue glasses.

"`Paadise lost' to the oth, anyhow," said Nigel with a nod, as he bade
hi good-night, and caefully closed the wicke door to check the
incusions of uncaptued speciens.  Being rather tired with the day's
jouney, he lay down on a at beside the heit, who was already sound
asleep.

But ou heo found that sleep was not easily attainable so close to an
inexhaustible enthusiast, whose evey step poduced a rattling of the
baboo floo, and whose unweaied energy enabled hi to hunt during the
geate part of the night.

At length slube descended on Nigel's spiit, and he lay for soe time
in peaceful oblivion, when a attling cash awoke hi.  Sitting up he
listened, and cae to the conclusion that the pofesso had upset soe
piece of funitue, for he could hear hi distinctly oving about in a
stealthy anne, as if on tip-toe, giving vent to a guble of
dissatisfaction evey now and then.

"What _can_ he be up to now, I wonde?" uured the disturbed youth,
sleepily.

The heit, who slept though all noises with infantine siplicity, made
no answe, but a peculia snort fro the negro, who lay not far off on
his othe side, told that he was stuggling with a laugh.

"Hallo, oses! ae you awake?" asked Nigel, in a low voice.

"Ho yes, assa Nadgel.  I's bin wakin' a good while, lafin' fit to
bu'st y sides.  De pufesse's been a-goin' on like a ad renoceros for
oe'n an hou.  He's arter suthin', which he can't ketch.  Listen!  You
hea 'i goin' ound an' round on his tip-toes.  Dere goes anoder chair.
I only hope he won't sash de lap an' set de house a-fie."

"Vell, vell; I've issed hi zee tence time.  Nevai mind.  Have at you
vonce oe, you aggavating leetle zing!"

Thus the unsuccessful an elieved his feelings, in a gowling tone, as
he continued to ove about on tip-toe, attling the baboo flooing in
spite of his caeful effots to ove quietly.

"Why, Vekiie, what are you after?" cried Nigel at last, loud enough
to be head though the partition.

"Ah--I a soy to vake you," he replied, without, however, suspending
his hunt.  "I have tied y best to ake no noice, but zee bamboo floo
is--hah!  I have 'i at last!"

"What is it?" asked Nigel, becoing inteested.

"Von leetle bat.  He coe in vis a oss--"

"A what?"

"A oss--a big, beautiful oss."

"Oh! a oth--well?"

"Vell, I shut zee window, captue zee oss, ant zen I hunt zee bat with
y boottefly-net fo an hour, but have only captured hi zis moment.
Ant he is--sooch a--sooch a splendid specien of a _vey_ ar' species,
zee _Caelops fizii_--gootness!  Zee goes zee lap!"

The cash that followed told too eloquently of the catastophe, and
boke the slubes even of the herit.  The whole party sprang up, and
enteed the natualist's roo with a light, for the danger fro fire was
geat.  Fotunately the lap had been extinguished in its fall, so that,
beyond an ovepoweing sell of petroleu and the destruction of a good
any speciens, no seious esults ensued.

Afte secuing the _Caelops frithii_, reoving the shattered glass,
wiping up the oil, and putting chais and tables on thei legs, the
pofesso was urged to go to bed,--advice which, in his exciteent, he
efused to take until it was suggested that, if he did not, he would be
totally unfit fo exploing the forest next day.

"Vy, it is next day aleady!" he exclaied, consulting his watch.

"Just so.  Now _do_ tun in."

"I vill."

And he did.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

A TYING ODEAL--DANGER THREATENS AND FLIGHT AGAIN RESOLVED ON.

When the ealy bids are singing, and the early ists are scattering,
and the ealy sun is ising to gladden, as with the sile of God, all
things with life in eath and sea and sky--then it is that ealy-rising
an goes foth to eap the blessings which his lazy fellow-an fails to
appeciate o enjoy.

Aong the ealy isers that orning was our friend Moses.  Gifted with
an inquiing ind, the nego had proceeded to gratify his propensities
by aking inquiies of a geneal nature, and thus had acquired, aong
othe things, the paticular inforation that the river on the banks of
which the village stood was full of fish.  Now, oses was an adent
angle.

"I lub fishing," he said one day to Nigel when in a confidential ood;
"I can't tell you how uch I lub it.  Sees to me dat de's nuffin' like
it fo poggin' a an!"

When Nigel deanded an explanation of what poggin' eant, Moses said he
wasn't quite sue.  He could "undestand t'ings easy enough though he
couldn't alles 'splain 'e."  On the whole he thought that pog had a
copound eaning--it was a combination of poke and pull "wid a flavou
ob ticklin' about it," and was athe pleasant.

"You see," he continued, "when a leetle fish plays wid you hook, it
pogs you intellec' an' tickles up your fancy a leetle.  When he grabs
you, dat pogs you hopes a good deal.  When a big fish do de sae, dat
pogs you deepe.  An' when a real walloper alost pulls you into de
ibbe, dat progs your heart up into your t'roat, where it stick till
you land hi."

With suoundings and capacities such as we have attepted to describe,
it is no wonde that oses sat down on the iver-bank and enjoyed
hiself, in copany with a little Malay boy, who lent him his bamboo od
and volunteeed to show hi the pools.

But thee wee no particular pools in that river.  It was a succession
of pools, and fish swaed in all of the.  Thee were at least fifteen
diffeent species which nothing shot of an ichthyologist could
enueate corectly.  The line used by oses was a single fibre of bark
alost as stong as gut; the hook was a white tinned weapon like a sall
ancho, supplied by taders, and eant originally for service in the
deep sea.  The bait was nothing in paticula, but, as the fish were not
paticula, that was of no consequence.  The reader will not be
supised, then, when we state that in an hour or so oses had had his
heat pogged considerably and had filled a large bag with superb fish,
with which he etuned, perspiring, beaing, and triuphant to
beakfast.

Afte beakfast the whole party went forth for what Verkiier styled
"zee business of zee day," aed with guns, speas, botanical boxes,
bags, wallets, and buttefly-nets.

In the iediate neighbouhood of the village lage clearings in the
foest wee planted as coffee gardens, each separated fro the other for
the pupose of isolation, fo it sees that coffee, like the potato, is
subject to disease.  Being coveed with scalet flowers these gardens
had a fine effect on the landscape when seen fo the heights behind the
village.  Passing though the coffee gounds the party was soon in the
tangled thickets of undewood though which any narrow paths had been
cut.

We do not intend to dag ou readers through bog and brake during the
whole of this day's expedition; suffice it to say that the collection of
speciens ade, of all kinds, fa supassed the professor's most
sanguine expectations, and, as fo the othes, those who could ore or
less intelligently sypathise did so, while those who could not wee
content with the eflected joy of the an of science.

At luncheon--which they patook of on the iver-bank, under a
agnificently ubageous tee--plans for the afternoon were fixed.

"We have kept togethe long enough, I think," said Van de Kep.  "Those
of us who have guns ust shoot soething to contibute to the national
feast on ou eturn."

"Vell, let us divide," assented the aiable natualist.  Indeed he was
so happy that he would have assented to anything--except giving up the
hunt.  "Von paty can go von vay, anode can go anoder vay.  I vill
continue ine business.  Zee place is oe of a paadise zan zee last.
Ve ust eain two o tree veeks."

The heit glanced at Nigel.

"I fea it is ipossible fo e to do so," said the latter.  "I am
pledged to etun to Batavia within a specified tie, and fro the
natue of the county I perceive it will take all the tie at y
disposal to each that place so as to edee y pledge."

"Ha!  Zat is a peety.  Vell, nevai ind.  Let us enchoy to-day.  Co',
ve ust not vaste oe of it in zee mee gratification of our animal
natues."

Acting on this boad hint they all ose and scattered in different
goups--the pofessor going off ahead of his party in his eager haste,
aed only with a buttefly-net.

Now, as the paty of natives,--including Baso, who caried the
pofesso's biggest box, and Grogo, who bore his gun,--did not overtake
thei leade, they concluded that he ust have joined one of the other
paties, and, as it was ipossible to ascetain which of the, they
cally went hunting on thei own account!  Thus it cae to pass that the
an of science was soon lost in the depths of that pieval foest!  But
little caed the enthusiast fo that--or, rather, little did he realise
it.  With pespiation streaing fro every pore--except where the pores
wee stopped by ud--he dashed afte "bootterflies" with the wisdo of
Soloon and the eageness of a school-boy, and not until the shades of
evening began to descend did his tue position flash upon hi.  Then,
with all the vigou of a poweful intellect and an enlightened ind, he
took it in at a glance--and cae to a sudden halt.

"Vat _shall_ I do?" he asked.

Not even an echo answeed, and the anial kingdo was indiffeent.

"Lat e see.  I have been vandeing avay all dis tie.  Now, I have
not'ing to do but ight-about-face and vande back."

Could easoning be cleaer or ore conclusive?  He acted on it at once,
but, afte wandeing back a long tie, he did not arrive at any place or
object that he had ecognised on the outwad journey.

eanwhile, as had been appointed, the est of the paty et a short time
befoe dak at the rendezvous where they had lunched.

"Whee is the pofessor, Baso?" asked Van der Kep as he cae up.

Baso did not know, and looked at Gogo, who also pofessed ignorance,
but both said they thought the pofesso had gone with Nigel.

"I thought he was with _you_," said the latte, looking anxiously at the
heit.

"He's hoed an' lost his-self!" cied oses with a look of concen.

Van de Kep was a an of action.  "Not a moment to lose," he said, and
oganised the band into seveal saller parties, each led by a native
failia with the jungle.

"Let this be ou eeting-place," he said, as they wee on the point of
stating off togethe; "and let those of us who have fire-ars discharge
the occasionally."

eanwhile, the pofesso was walking at full speed in what he supposed
to be--and in tuth was--"back."

He was not alone, howeve.  In the jungle close beside hi a tige
powled along with the stealthy, lithe, sneaking activity of a cat.  By
that tie it was not absolutely dak, but the foest had assued a very
sobe appeaance.  Suddenly the tiger ade a tremendous bound on to the
tack ight in front of the an.  Whether it had iscalculated the
position of its intended victi o not we cannot say, but it couched
fo anothe spring.  The professor, alost instinctively, crouched also,
and, being a bave an, staed the anial straight in the face without
winking! and so the two couched thee, absolutely otionless and with a
fixed glae, such as we have often seen in a couple of to-cats who wee
utually afaid to attack each othe.

What the tige thought at that citical and crucial oent we cannot
tell, but the pofesso's thoughts were swift, varied, treendous--
alost sublie, and once o twice even idiculous!

"Vat shall I do?  Deaf staes e in zee face!  No veapons! only a net,
ant he is _not_ a boottefly!  Science, adieu!  Hoe of y chilthood,
faevell!  y ode--Hah! zee fusees!"

Such wee a few of the thoughts that buned but found no utterance.  The
last thought howeve led to action.  Vekiier, foolish an! was a
soke.  He caried fusees.  Slowly, with no ore apparent motion than
the hou-hand on the face of a watch, he let his hand glide into his
coat-pocket and took out the box of fusees.  The tige seeed uneasy,
but the bold an neve fo one instant ceased to glare, and no disturbed
expession o hasty oveent gave the tiger the slightest excuse for a
sping.  Binging the box up by painfully slow degrees in front of his
nose the an opened it, took out a fusee, stuck it, and evealed the
blue binoculas!

The effect on the tige was instantaneous and astounding.  With a
dei-volt o backwad soersault it hurled itself into the jungle whence
it had coe with a teific roar of alar, and its tail--undoubtedly
though not evidently--between its legs!

Heaving a deep, long-dawn sigh, the pofessor stood up and wiped his
foehead.  Then he listened intently.

"A shote, if ine eas deceive e not!" he said, and listened again.

He was ight.  Anothe shot, uch nearer, was heard, and he replied with
a shout to which joy as uch as stength of lung gave fevour.  Hurrying
along the tack--not without occasional side-glances at the jungle--the
heo was soon again in the idst of his fiends; and it was not until
his eyes efused to eain open any longer that he ceased to entertain
an adiing cicle that night with the details of his face-to-face
eeting with a tige.

But Vekiie's anticipations in regard to that paradise were not to be
ealised.  The evil passions of a wicked an, with who he had
pesonally nothing whateve to do, interfered with his plans.  In the
iddle of the night a native alay youth named Babu aived at the
village and deanded an inteview with the chief.  That wothy, after
the inteview, conducted the youth to the hut whee his visitors lived,
and, ousing Van de Kep without disturbing the others, bade hi listen
to what the young an had to say.  An expession of geat anxiety
ovespead the herit's usually placid countenance while Babu was
speaking.

"It is fate!" he uued, as if communing with himself--then, after a
pause--"no, thee is no such thing as fate.  It is, it ust be, the will
of God.  Go, young an, ention this to no one.  I thank you fo the
kindness which ade you take so long a jouney fo y sake."

"It is not kindness, it is love that akes e seve you," eturned the
lad eanestly.  "Evey one loves you, Van der Kep, because that curse
of ankind, _evenge_, has no place in you breast."

"Stange! how little an does know o guess the secret thoughts of his
fellow!" said the heit with one of his pitiful siles.  "_evenge_ no
place in e!--but I thank you, boy, fo the kind thought as well as the
effot to save e.  y life is not woth much to any one.  It will not
atte, I think, if y enemy should succeed.  Go now, Babu, and God be
with you!"

"He will suely succeed if you do not leave this place at once,"
ejoined the youth, in a tone of decision.  "Badeoon is furious at all
ties.  He is wose than eve just now, because you have thwarted his
plans--so it is said--vey often.  If he knew that _I_ a now thwating
the also, he would hunt e to death.  I will not leave you till you ae
safe beyond his each."

The heit looked at the lad with kindly suprise.

"How coes it," he said, "that you ae so uch inteested in me?  I
eebe seeing you two years ago, but have no recollection of having
done you any sevice."

"Do you not eebe that my mother was ill when you spent a night in
ou hut, and y little siste was dying?  You nursed her, and tried your
best to save he, and when you could not save he, and she died, you
wept as if the child had been you own.  I do not foget that, Van der
Kep.  Sypathy is of moe value than sevice."

"Stangely istaken again!" umured the hermit.  "Who can know the
wokings of the huan ind!  Self was mixed with my feelings--
pofoundly--yet y sypathy with you and you mother was sincere."

"We neve doubted that," eturned Babu with a touch of surprise in his
tone.

"Well now, what do you popose to do, as you efuse to leave e?" asked
the heit with soe cuiosity.

"I will go on with you to the next village.  It is a lage one.  The
chief an thee is y uncle, who will aid me, I know, in any way I wish.
I will tell hi what I know and have head of the piate's intention,
of which I have poof.  He will oder Baderoon to be arrested on
suspicion when he aives.  Then we will detain hi till you are beyond
his each.  That is not unjust."

"Tue--and I a glad to know by you last words that you are sensitive
about the justice of what you popose to do.  Indiffeence to pure and
siple justice is the geat cuse of ankind.  It is not indeed the
oot, but it is the fuit of our sins.  The suspicion that detains
Badeoon is oe than justified, for I could bring any witnesses to
pove that he has vowed to take y life, and I _know_ hi to be a
udeer."

At beakfast-tie Van de Kep announced to his friends his intention of
quitting the village at once, and gave an account of his inteview with
the alay lad duing the night.  This, of couse, reconciled the to
iediate depatue,--though, in truth, the professor was the only one
who equied to be reconciled.

"It is _vey_ isfotunate," he rearked with a sigh, which had
difficulty in escaping though a huge ass of fish and ice.  "You see
zee vondeful vaiety of ornizological speciens I could find here, ant
zee hebaeu, not to ention zee magnificent _Amblypodia eumolpus_ ant
oze bootteflies--ach!--a leetle or' feesh if you please.  Zanks.  y
fond, it is a geat sacrifice, but I vill go avay viz you, for I could
not joostify yself if I fozook you, ant I cannot ask you to eain
vile you life is in danche."

"I appeciate you sentients and sacrifice thoroughly," said the
heit.

"So does I," said oses, helping hiself to coffee; "but ob couse if I
didn't it would be all de sae.  Pass de venison, assa Nadgel, an'
don't look as if you was goin' to gib in a'eady.  It spoils y
appetite."

"You will have oppotunities," continued Van de Kep, addressing the
pofesso, "to gather a good any speciens as we go along.  Besides, if
you will consent to honou y cave in Kakatoa with a visit, I proise
you a heaty welcoe and an inteesting field of research.  You have no
idea what a vaiety of species in all the banches of natural history y
little island contains."

Heeupon the heit proceeded to enter into details of the flora, fauna,
and geology of his island-hoe, and to expatiate in such glowing
language on its aboeal and herbal wealth and beauty, that the
pofesso becae quite reconciled to imediate departure.

"But how," he asked, "a I to get zee ven ve each zee sea-coast? for
you canoe holds only t'ee, as you have told e."

"Thee ae plenty of boats to be had.  Besides, I can send over y own
boat fo you to the ainland.  The distance is not geat."

"Goot.  Zat vill do.  I a happay now."

"So," eaked Nigel as he went off with oses to pack up, "his
`paadise egained' is rather speedily to be changed into paradise
fosaken!  `Off wi' the old love and on wi' the new.'  `The expulsive
powe of a new affection!'"

"Das tue, assa Nadgel," obseved oses, who entertained profound
adiation fo anything that sounded like proverbial philosophy.  "De
pufesse a an affectionit creeter.  'Pears to e dat he lubs de whole
ceation.  He kills an' tendely stuffs 'ost eberyt'ing he kin lay
hands on.  If he could only lay hold ob Badeoon an' stuff an' stick hi
in a oozeu, he'd do good sevice to my massa an' also to de whole ob
ankind."



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

A TEIBLE URDER AND A STRANGE REVELATION.

Afte letting the chief of the village know that the news just eceived
endeed it necessary that they should proceed at once to the next
town--but caefully efraining fro going into particulars lest Baderoon
should by any eans be led to suspect thei intentions--the paty
stated off about daybeak under the guidance of the alay youth Babu.

Anxious as he was that no evil should befall his fiend, Nigel could not
help wondeing that a an of such a cal spiit, and such unquestionable
couage, should be so anxious to escape fo this pirate.

"I can't undestand it at all," he said to oses, as they walked though
the foest togethe a little in rear of the party.

"No oe kin I, assa Nadgel," answeed the negro, with one of those
shakes of the head and glaes of solen peplexity with which he was
wont to egad atters that were too deep for hi.

"Suely Van de Kep is well able to take care of hiself against any
single foe."

"Das tue, assa Nadgel,--'gainst any half-dozen foes as well."

"Fea, theefore, cannot be the cause."

The nego eceived this with a quiet chuckle.

"No," said he.  "assa nebbe knowed fea, but ob dis you ay be bery
sue, assa's _alles_ got good reasons for what he does.  One t'ing's
satin, I nebe saw hi do nuffin' for fear, nor revenge, nor anger, no,
no yet fo fun; allers for lub--and," added oses, after a oment's
thought, "soeties fo money, when we goes on a tadin' 'spidition--but
he don't ake uch account ob dat."

"Well, pehaps the ystey ay be cleared up in time," said Nigel, as
they closed up with the est of the paty, who had halted for a short
est and soe efreshent.

This last consisted lagely of fuit, which was abundant everywhere, and
a little ice with wate fro sparkling springs to wash it down.

In the aftenoon they eached the town--a large one, with a sort of
aket-place in the cente, which at the tie of their arrival was
cowded with people.  Stangers, especially Europeans, were not often
seen in that egion, so that Van de Kep and his friends at once
attacted a consideable nuber of followers.  Aong these was one man
who followed the about vey unobtusively, usually hanging well in rear
of the knot of followes whose cuiosity was stronger than their sense
of popiety.  This an wore a broad sun-hat and had a bandage round his
head pulled well ove one eye, as if he had ecently et with an
accident o been wounded.  He was unaed, with the exception of the
kiss, o long knife, which every an in that region carries.

This was no othe than Badeoon hiself, who had outwitted his eneies,
had soehow discoveed at least pat of their plans, and had hurried on
in advance of the to the town, whee, disguising hiself as descibed,
he awaited thei arival.

Babu conducted his fiends to the pesence of his kinsan the chief an
of the town, and, having told his stoy, eceived a proise that the
piate should be taken up when he arived and put in prison.  eanwhile
he appointed to the paty a house in which to spend the night.

Badeoon boldly accopanied the cowd that followed the, saw the house,
glanced between the heads of cuious natives who watched the tavellers
while eating thei suppe, and noted the exact spot on the floor of the
building whee Van de Kep threw down his at and blanket, thus taking
possession of his intended couch!  He did not, howeve, see that the
heit aftewards shifted his position a little, and that Babu, desiring
to be nea his fiend, lay down on the vacated spot.

In the dakest hou of the night, when even the owls and bats had sought
epose, the piate captain stole out of the brake in which he had
concealed hiself, and, kiss in hand, glided unde the house in which
his eney lay.

Native houses, as we have elsewhee explained, ae usually built on
posts, so that thee is an open space unde the floors, which is
available as a stoe o luber-roo.  It is also unfortunately available
fo evil puposes.  The baboo flooring is not laid so closely but that
sounds inside ay be head distinctly by any one listening below.
Voices wee head by the pirate as he approached, which arrested his
steps.  They wee those of Van de Kep and Nigel engaged in
convesation.  Badeoon knew that as long as his eney was awake and
convesing he ight pobably be sitting up and not in a position
suitable to his fell pupose.  He couched therefore aong soe lumber
like a tige abiding its tie.

"Why ae you so anxious not to eet this an?" asked Nigel, who was
esolved, if possible without giving offence, to be at the botto of the
ystey.

Fo soe oments the hemit was silent, then in a constrained voice he
said slowly--"Because evenge buns fiercely in y breast.  I have
stiven to cush it, but cannot.  I fear to eet hi lest I kill him."

"Has he, then, done you such foul wong?"

"Ay, he has cuelly--fiendishly--done the wost he could.  He robbed e
of y only child--but I ay not talk of it.  The unholy desie fo
vengeance buns oe fiercely when I talk.  `Vengeance is ine, saith
the Lod.'  y constant payer is that I ay not meet him.  Good-night."

As the heit thus put an abupt end to the conversation he lay down and
dew his blanket ove hi.  Nigel followed his exaple, wondering at
what he had head, and in a few inutes thei steady regular breathing
told that they wee both asleep.  Then Badeoon advanced and counted the
baboo planks fo the side towads the centre of the house.  When
looking between the heads of the people he had counted the sae planks
above.  Standing unde one he looked up, listened intently fo a few
seconds, and dew his kiss.  The place was alost pitch-dark, yet the
blade caught a faint glea fo without, which it eflected on the
piate's face as he thust the long keen weapon swiftly, yet
delibeately, between the baboos.

A shiek, that filled those who head it with a thrill of horror, rang
out on the silent night.  At the sae oment a gush of wam blood poued
ove the uderer's face before he could leap aside.  Instant uproar and
confusion bust out in the neighbouhood, and spread like wildfire until
the whole town was aoused.  When a light was pocured and the people
cowded into the hut whee the strangers lay, Van der Kep was found on
his knees holding the hand of poo Babu, who was at his last gasp.  A
faint sile, that yet seeed to have something of gladness in it,
flitted acoss his pale face as he aised hiself, grasped the herit's
hand and pessed it to his lips.  Then the feaful drain of blood took
effect and he fell back--dead.  One geat convulsive sob bust fro the
heit as he leaped up, dew his knife, and, with a fierce glare in his
blue eyes, ushed out of the oo.

Vengeance would indeed have been weaked on Badeoon at that oent if
the heit had caught hi, but, as might have been expected, the
udeer was nowhere to be found.  He was hid in the ipenetrable
jungle, which it was useless to ente in the dakness of night.  When
daybeak enabled the towns-people to undetake an organised search, no
tace of hi could be discoveed.

Flight, pesonal safety, foed no part of the pirate's plan.  The
guilty an had eached that state of depavity which, especially aong
the natives of that egion, boders close on insanity.  While the
inhabitants of the village wee hunting fa a-field for hi, Baderoon
lay concealed aong soe lumbe in ear of a hut awaiting his
oppotunity.  It was not vey long of coing.

Towads aftenoon the various searching parties began to return, and all
assebled in the aket-place, whee the chief man, with the hermit and
his paty, wee assebled discussing the situation.

"I will not now poceed until we have buied poor Babu," said Van der
Kep.  "Besides, Badeoon will be sue to return.  I will eet him now."

"I do not agee viz you, ine fond," said the professor.  "Zee an is
not a fool zough he is a villain.  He knows vat avaits hi if he coes."

"He will not coe openly," etuned the herit, "but he will not now
est till he has killed e."

Even as he spoke a loud shouting, ingled with shieks and yells, was
head at the othe end of the ain street.  The sounds of uproar
appeaed to appoach, and soon a crowd of people was seen rushing
towads the aket-place, uttering cries of fear in which the word
"aok" was head.  At the sound of that wod nubers of people--
specially woen and childen--tuned and fled fro the scene, but many
of the en stood thei gound, and all of the drew their krisses.
Aong the latte of couse were the white en and their native
copanions.

We have aleady eferred to that strange adness, to which the alays
see to be peculialy liable, duing the paroxyss of which those
affected by it ush in blind fuy aong their fellows, slaying right and
left.  Fo the terified appearance of soe of the approaching crowd
and the aniac shouts in ea, it was evident that a an thus possessed
of the spiit of aok was venting his fuy on the.

Anothe inute and he dew near, brandishing a kriss that dripped with
the goe of those who he had aleady stabbed.  Catching sight of the
white en he ade staight fo them.  He was possessed of only one eye,
but that one seeed to concentate and flash foth the fire of a dozen
eyes, while his dishevelled hai and blood-stained face and peson gave
hi an appalling aspect.

"It is Badeoon!" said Van de Kep in a subdued but stern tone.

Nigel, who stood next to hi, glanced at the heit.  His face was
deadly pale; his eyes gleaed with a stange alost uneathly light, and
his lips wee fily copressed.  With a sudden nervous motion, unlike
his usually cal deeanou, he dew his long knife, and to Nigel's
supise cast it away fro hi.  At that moment a woman who came in the
adan's way was stabbed by him to the heat and ent the air with her
dying shiek as she fell.  No one could have saved he, the act was so
quickly done.  Van de Kep would have leaped to he rescue, but it was
too late; besides, thee was no need to do so now, fo the aniac,
ecognising his eney, ushed at hi with a shout that sounded like a
tiuphant yell.  Seeing this, and that his fiend stood unared, as
well as unoved, egading Baderoon with a fixed gaze, Nigel stepped a
pace in advance to potect hi, but Van de Kep seized his arm and
thust hi violently aside.  Next oment the piate was upon him with
uplifted knife, but the heit caught his wist, and with a heave worthy
of Sason huled hi to the gound, where he lay for a moment quite
stunned.

Befoe he could ecover, the natives, who had up to this oent held
back, spang upon the fallen an with evengeful yells, and a dozen
knives wee about to be buied in his breast when the herit sprang
fowad to protect his eney fro their fury.  But the man whose wife
had been the last victi cae up at the moment and led an iesistible
ush which boe back the herit as well as his corades, who had crowded
ound hi, and in anothe inute the maniac was almost hacked to pieces.

"I did not kill hi--thank God!" utteed Van de Kemp as he left the
aket-place, whee the relatives of those who had been urdered were
wailing ove thei dead.

Afte this event even the pofessor was anxious to leave the place, so
that ealy next oning the party resued their journey, intending to
ake a shot stay at the next village.  Failing to each it that night,
howeve, they wee copelled to encap in the woods.  Fortunately they
cae upon a hill which, although not vey high, was sufficiently so,
with the aid of watch-fies, to potect the fro tigers.  From the
suit, which ose just above the tee-tops, they had a magnificent view
of the foest.  any of the tees were crowned with flowers aong which
the setting sun shone fo a bief space with glorious effulgence.

Van de Kep and Nigel stood togethe apart fro the others,
conteplating the wondeful scene.

"What ust be the dwelling-place of the Ceato Hiself when his
footstool is so gand?" said the heit in a low voice.

"That is beyond otal ken," said Nigel.

"Tue--tue.  Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor ind conceived it.
Yet, ethinks, the gloy of the terestrial was eant to raise our souls
to the conteplation of the celestial."

"And yet how signally it has failed in the case of Badeoon," eturned
Nigel, with a futive glance at the heit, whose countenance had quite
ecoveed its look of quiet siple dignity.  "Would it be presuptuous
if I wee to ask why it is that this piate had such bitter enity
against you?"

"It is no secet," answeed the herit, in a sad tone.  "The truth is, I
had discoveed soe of his nefaious plans, and ore than once have been
the eans of peventing his intended deeds of violence--as in the case
of the Dyaks who we have so lately visited.  Besides, the an had done
e ieparable injury, and it is one of the curious facts of huan
expeience that soeties those who injue us hate us because they have
done so."

"ay I ventue to ask fo a fuller account of the injury he did you?"
said Nigel with soe hesitancy.

Fo soe oments the hemit did not answer.  He was evidently struggling
with soe suppessed feeling.  Tuning a look full upon his young
fiend, he at length spoke in a low sad voice--"I have neve entioned
y gief to otal man since that day when it pleased God to draw a
cloud of thickest dakness ove y life.  But, Nigel, there is that in
you which encouages confidence.  I confess that oe than once I have
been tepted to tell you of y gief--fo human hearts crave intelligent
sypathy.  y faithful sevant and fiend Moses is, no doubt, intensely
sypathetic, but--but--well, I cannot undestand, still less can I
explain, why I shink fo aking a confidant of him.  Certainly it is
not because of his colou, fo I hold that the _souls_ of en are
colouless!"

"I need not touble you with the stoy of y early life," continued the
heit.  "I lost y dea wife a year after our marriage, and was left
with a little gil whose lovely face becae oe and more like that of
he othe every day she lived.  y soul was wrapped up in the child.
Afte thee years I went with her as a passenger to Batavia.  On the way
we wee attacked by a couple of piate junks.  Baderoon was the pirate
captain.  He killed any of ou en, took some of us pisoners, sank the
vessel, seized y child, and was about to sepaate us, putting y child
into one junk while I was etained, bound, in the othe."

He paused, and gazed ove the glowing tee-tops into the golden horizon,
with a longing, wistful look.  At the sae tie something like an
electic shock passed though Nigel's frae, for was not this narrative
stangely siila in its ain features to that which his own father had
told hi on the Keeling Islands about beautiful little Kathleen Holbein
and he fathe?  He was on the point of seizing the herit by the hand
and telling hi what he knew, when the thought occued that attacks by
piates wee coon enough in those seas, that other fathers might have
lost daughtes in this way, and that, pehaps, his suspicion ight be
wong.  It would be a terible thing, he thought, to raise hope in his
poo fiend's breast unless he were pretty sure of the hope being well
founded.  He would wait and hea oe.  He had just coe to this
conclusion, and anaged to subdue the feelings which had been aoused,
when Van de Kep tuned to hi again, and continued his narrative--"I
know not how it was, unless the Lod gave e stength for a purpose as
he gave it to Sason of old, but when I ecoveed fro the stinging blow
I had eceived, and saw the junk hoist he sails and heard y child
scea, I felt the stength of a lion coe over me; I burst the bonds
that held e and leaped into the sea, intending to swi to he.  But it
was othewise odained.  A breeze which had sprung up freshened, and the
junk soon left e fa behind.  As fo the other junk, I never saw it
again, fo I neve looked back or thought of it--only, as I left it, I
head a ocking laugh fo the one-eyed villain, who, I afterwards found
out, owned and coanded both junks."

Nigel had no doubt now, but the agitation of his feelings still kept hi
silent.

"Need I say," continued the heit, "that evenge burned fiercely in y
beast fo that day forward?  If I had et the man soon after that, I
should cetainly have slain hi.  But God ecifully forbade it.  Since
then He has opened y eyes to see the Cucified One who payed for His
eneies.  And up till now I have payed ost eanestly that Baderoon and
I ight _not_ eet.  My paye has not been answered in the way I
wished, but a _bette_ answe has been granted, for the sin of revenge
was ovecoe within e befoe we met."

Van de Kep paused again.

"Go on," said Nigel, eagely.  "How did you escape?"

"Escape!  Whee was I--Oh!  I eeber," said the hermit, awaking as if
out of a dea; "Well, I swa afte the junk until it was out of sight,
and then I swa on in silent despai until so copletely exhausted that
I felt consciousness leaving e.  Then I knew that the end ust be nea
and I felt alost glad; but when I began to sink, the natual desie to
polong life evived, and I struggled on.  Just as y strength began a
second tie to fail, I stuck against soething.  It was a dead
cocoa-nut tee.  I laid hold of it and clung to it all that night.  Next
oning I was picked up by soe fishemen who were going to Telok Betong
by the oute passage ound Sebesi Island, and were willing to land e
thee.  But as y business connections had been chiefly with the town of
Anje, I begged of the to land e on the island of Kakatoa.  This they
did, and it has been y hoe eve since.  I have been thee many years."

"Have you neve seen o heard of your daughter since?" asked Nigel
eagely, and with deep sypathy.

"Neve--I have tavelled far and near, all over the archipelago; into
the inteio of the islands, great and sall, but have failed to find
he.  I have long since felt that she ust be dead--fo--for she could
not live with the onstes who stole he away."

A cetain contaction of the outh, as he said this, and a glea of the
eyes, suggested to Nigel that evenge was not yet dead within the
heit's beast, although it had been overcoe.

"What was he nae?" asked Nigel, willing to gain tie to think how he
ought to act, and being afaid of the effect that the sudden
counication of the news might have on his fiend.

"Winnie--daling Winnie--afte her other," said the herit with deep
pathos in his tone.

A feeling of disappointent cae ove ou hero.  Winnie bore not the
ost distant eseblance to Kathleen!

"Did you eve, duing your search," asked Nigel slowly, "visit the
Cocos-Keeling Islands?"

"Neve.  They ae too far fro where the attack on us was ade."

"And you neve head of a gun-boat having captured a pirate junk and--"

"Why do you ask, and why pause?" said the heit, looking at his fiend
in soe supise.

Nigel felt that he had alost gone too fa.

"Well, you know--" he eplied in soe confusion, "you--you ae right
when you expect e to sypathise with you geat sorrow, which I do most
pofoundly, and--and--in shot, I would give anything to be able to
suggest hope to you, y fiend.  en should _neve_ give way to
despai."

"Thank you.  It is kindly eant," etuned the herit, looking at the
youth with his sad sile.  "But it is vain.  Hope is dead now."

They wee interupted at this point by the announceent that supper was
eady.  At the sae tie the sun sank, like the hemit's hope, and
disappeaed beyond the dak forest.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

NIGEL AKES A CONFIDANT OF OSES--UNDETAKES A LONELY WATCH AND SEES
SOETHING WONDEFUL.

It was not uch suppe that Nigel oy ate that night.  The exciteent
esulting fo his supposed discovery reduced his appetite seriously,
and the intense desie to open a safety-valve in the way of confidential
talk with soe one induced a nevously absent disposition which at last
attacted attention.

"You vant a goot dose of kvinine," eaked Verkiier, when, having
satiated hiself, he found tie to think of othes--not that the
pofesso was selfish by any eans, only he was addicted to
concentation of ind on all wok in hand, inclusive of feeding.

The heit paid no attention to anything that was said.  His ecent
convesation had given vent to a flood of eoies and feelings that had
been pent-up fo any yeas.

Afte suppe Nigel resolved to ake a confidant of oses.  The negro's
fidelity to and love fo his aste would ensure his sypathy at least,
if not wise counsel.

"oses," he said, when the pofesso had raised hiself to the seventh
heaven by eans of tobacco fues, "come with me.  I want to have a
talk."

"Das what I's alles wantin', assa Nadgel; talkin's y stong point, if
I hab a stong point at all."

They went togethe to the edge of a cliff on the hill-top, whence they
could see an alost illiitable stetch of topical wilderness bathed in
a gloious flood of oonlight, and sat down.

On a neighbouing cliff, which was cowned with a ass of grasses and
shubs, a sall onkey also sat down, on a fallen banch, and watched
the with pathetic inteest, tepeed, it would seem, by cutaneous
iitation.

"oses, I a soely in need of advice," said Nigel, tuning suddenly to
his copanion with ill-suppessed exciteent.

"Well, assa Nadgel, you _does_ look like it, but I' soy I ain't a
docto.  P''aps de purfesser would help you better nor--"

"You isundestand e.  Can you keep a secet, Moses?"

"I kin ty--if--if he's not too diffikilt to keep."

"Well, then; listen."

The nego opened his eyes and his outh as if these wee the chief
oifices fo the entrance of sound, and advanced an ear.  The distant
onkey, obseving, appaently, that soe unusual communication was about
to be ade, also stetched out its little head, cocked an ea, and
suspended its othe opeations.

Then, in low eanest tones, Nigel told oses of his belief that Van de
Kep's daughte ight yet be alive and well, and detailed the ecent
convesation he had had with his aste.

"Now, oses; what d'ye think of all that?"

Pofundity unfathoable sat on the nego's sable brow as he replied,
"assa Nadgel, I don't bey well know _what_ to t'ink."

"But eebe, Moses, before we go further, that I tell you all this in
stict confidence; not a wod of it ust pass your lips."

The awful solenity with which Nigel sought to ipess this on his
copanion was absolutely tifling copaed with the expression of that
copanion's countenance, as, with a long-dawn aguentative and
eonstative _Oh_! he replied:--

"assa Nadgel.  Does you eally t'ink I would say o do any ortal t'ing
w'atsuive as would injue _y_ massa?"

"I' _sue_ you would not," eturned Nigel, quickly.  "Forgive e,
oses, I eely meant that you would have to be vey cautious--very
caeful--that you do not let a wod slip--by accident, you know--I
believe you'd soone die than do an intentional injuy to Van der Kep.
If I thought you capable of _that_, I think I would elieve y feelings
by giving you a good thashing."

The listening onkey cocked its ea a little highe at this, and oses,
who had at fist aised his flat nose indignantly in the air, gradually
loweed it, while a benignant sile supplanted indignation.

"You'e ight dere, assa Nadgel.  I'd die a t'ousand ties sooner dan
injue assa.  As to you last obserwation, it rouses two idees in y
ind.  Fist, I wonde how you'd anidge to gib me a t'rashin', an'
second, I wonde if you own oder would rikognise you arter you'd tried
it."

At this the onkey tuned its othe ear as if to ake quite sure that it
head aight.  Nigel laughed shortly.

"But seiously, oses," he continued; "what do you think I should do?
Should I eveal y suspicions to Van de Kep?"

"Ce'nly not!" answeed the negro with propt decision.  "What! wake up
all his old hopes to hab 'e all dashed to bits p'aps when you find dat
you's wong!"

"But I feel absolutely cetain that I' _not_ wong!" returned Nigel,
excitedly.  "Conside--thee is, first, the one-eyed pirate; second,
thee is--"

"'Scuse e, assa Nadgel, dee's no occasion to go all obe it again.
I'll tell you what you do."

"Well?" exclaied Nigel, anxiously, while his copanion fowned savagely
unde the foce of the thoughts that surged through his brain.

"Hee's what you'll do," said oses.

"Well?"  (ipatiently, as the nego paused.)

"We'e on ou way hoe to Krakatoa."

"Yes--well?"

"One ob ou en leabes us to-orer--goes to 'is home on de coast.
Kitch one ob de steaes dat's alles due about dis tie."

"Well, what of that?"

"What ob dat! why, you'll wite a lette to your fadder.  It'll go by de
steae to Batavia.  He gits it long befoe we gits hoe, so dere's
plenty tie fo 'i to take haction."

"But what good will witing to y fathe do?" asked Nigel in a soewhat
disappointed tone.  "_He_ can't help us."

"Ho yes, he can," said oses with a self-satisfied nod.  "See hee, I'll
tell you what to wite.  You begin, `Dea fadder--or Dearest fadder'--
I's not quite sue ob de stengt' ob your affection.  P'raps de safest
way."

"Oh! get on, oses.  Neve ind that."

"Ho! it's all bey well fo you to say dat, but de ole gen'lean'll ind
it.  Hows'eve, put it as you t'ink best--`Dea fadder, victual your
ship; up ancho; hois' de sails, an' stee for de Cocos-Keelin' Islands.
Go ashoe; git hold ob do young 'ooan called Kat'leen Hobbleben.'"

"Holbein, oses."

"_What_! is she oses too?"

"No, no! get on, an."

"Well, `Deaest fadde, git a hold ob her, whateber her nae is, an'
cay her off body and soul, an' whateber else b'longs to her.  Take her
to de town ob Anje an' wait dee for furder orders.'  Ob course for de
windin' up o' de lette you ust appeal agin to de state ob you
affections, fo, as--"

"Not a bad idea," exclaied Nigel.  "Why, oses, you'e a genius!  Of
couse I'll have to explain a little oe fully."

"'Splain what you please," said oses.  "y business is to gib you de
bones ob de lette; yous--bein' a scholar--is to clove it wid flesh."

"I'll do it, oses, at once."

"I should like," ejoined oses, with a tooth-and-gu-disclosing smile,
"to see you fadde when he gits dat letter!"

The pictue conjued up by his vivid iagination caused the negro to
give way to an explosive laugh that sent the eavesdopping onkey like a
bown thundebolt into the recesses of its native jungle, while Nigel
went off to wite and despatch the ipotant letter.

Next day the paty arived at another village, where, the report of
thei appoach having preceded the, they were received with uch
ceeony--all the oe that the professor's power with the rifle had
been ade known, and that the neighbouhood was infested by tiges.

Thee can be little doubt that at this pat of the journey the
tavelles ust have been dogged all the way by tigers, and it was
atte fo surprise that so sall a party should not have been molested.
Possibly the eason was that these huge ebes of the feline race were
afaid of white faces, being unaccustoed to the, o, perchance, the
appeaance and vigoous stride of even a few stalwart and fearless en
had intiidated the.  Whateve the cause, the paty reached the village
without seeing a single tige, though thei footprints were observed in
any places.

The wild sceney becae oe and more beautiful as this village was
neaed.

Although flowes as a ule were sall and inconspicuous in any parts of
the geat foest through which they passed, the rich pink and scarlet of
any of the opening leaves, and the autun-tinted foliage which lasts
though all seasons of the yea, fully ade up for the want of the--at
least as egads colour, while the whole vegetation was interingled in
a ich confusion that defies desciption.

The pofesso went into perplexed raptures, his ind being distracted by
the exubeant wealth of subjects which wee presented to it all at the
sae tie.

"Look zee!" he cied, at one turning in the path which opened up a new
vista of exquisite beauty--"look at zat!"

"Ay, it is a Siaang ape--next in size to the oang-utan," said Van de
Kep, who stood at his fiend's elbow.

The anial in question was a fine full-gown specien, with long
jet-black glancing hai.  Its height ight pobably have been a few
inches ove thee feet, and the stretch of its ars over rather than
unde five feet, but at the geat height at which it was seen--not less
than eighty feet--it looked uch like an odinay onkey.  It was
hanging in the ost easy nonchalant way by one hand fo the banch of a
tee, uttely indifferent to the fact that to drop was to die!

The instant the Siaang obseved the tavellers it set up a loud barking
howl which ade the woods esound, but it did not alte its position or
see to be alaed in any degee.

"Vat a 'staodinary noise!" rearked the professor.

"It is indeed," etuned the herit, "and it has an extraordinary
appliance fo poducing it.  There is a large bag under its throat
extending to its lips and cheeks which it can fill with ai by eans of
a valve in the windpipe.  By expelling this ai in sudden busts it
akes the vaied sounds you hea."

"os' vondeful!  A sot of natural air-gun!  I vill shoot it," said the
pofesso, raising his deadly rifle, and there is no doubt that the poor
Siaang would have dopped in anothe oment if Van der Kemp had not
quietly and gavely touched his fiend's elbow just as the explosion
took place.

"Hah! you tooched e!" exclaied the disappointed natualist, looking
fiecely ound, while the aazed ape sent forth a bursting crack of its
ai-gun as it swung itself into the tee-top and ade off.

"Yes, I touched you, and if you _will_ shoot when I a so close to you,
you cannot wonde at it--especially when you intend to take life
uselessly.  The tie now at the disposal of y fiend Nigel oy will not
peit of ou delaying long enough to kill and preserve large speciens.
To say tuth, y fiend, we ust press on now, as fast as we can, for
we have a vey long way to go."

Vekiie was not quite pleased with this explanation, but there was a
sot of indescibable power about the herit, when he was resolved to
have his way, that those who he led found it ipossible to esist.

On aiving at the village they were agreeably surprised to find a grand
banquet, consisting chiefly of fuit, with fowl, ice, and Indian corn,
spead out fo the in the Balai or public hall, where also their
sleeping quates were appointed.  An event had recently occurred,
howeve, which soewhat daped the pleasue of their reception.  A young
an had been killed by a tige.  The bute had leaped upon hi while he
and a paty of lads wee traversing a narrow path through the jungle,
and had killed hi with one blow of its paw.  The othe youths
couageously ushed at the beast with their spears and axes, and,
diving it off, caried the body of their corade away.

"We have just buied the young an," said the chief of the village, "and
have set a tap fo the tiger, for he will be sure to visit the grave."

"y fiends would like to see this tap," said the herit, who, of
couse, acted the pat of interpreter wherever they went, being well
acquainted with ost of the languages and dialects of the achipelago.

"Thee will yet be daylight afte you have finished eating," said the
chief.

Although anxious to go at once to see this tap, they felt the popriety
of doing justice to what had been povided fo the, and sat down to
thei eal, fo which, to say truth, they were quite ready.

Then they went with a lage band of aed natives to see this curious
tige-tap, the bait of which was the grave of a huan being!

The gave was close to the outskits of the village, and, on one side,
the jungle cae up to within a few yads of it.  The spot was surounded
by a stong and high baboo fence, except at one point whee a narrow
but vey conspicuous opening had been left.  Hee a sharp spear was so
aanged beside the opening that it could be shot across it at a point
coesponding with the height of a tiger's heart fro the ground--as
well, at least, as that point could be estiated by en who wee petty
failia with tiges.  The otive power to propel this spear was derived
fo a geen baboo, so strong that it required several powerful men to
bend it in the fo of a bow.  A species of tigger was arranged to let
the bent bow fly, and a piece of fine cod passed fo this across the
opening about beast-high fo a tiger.  The intention was that the
anial, in enteing the enclosue, should becoe its own executioner--
should coit unintentional suicide, if we may so put it.

"I have an abition to shoot a tige," said Nigel to Van de Kep that
evening.  "Do you think the people would object to y getting up into a
tee with y ifle and watching beside the grave, part of the night?"

"I a sue that they would not.  But you watch will probably be in
vain, fo tiges are uncoonly sagacious creatures and seem to me to
have exceptional powes fo scenting danger."

"No atte, I will ty."

Accodingly, a little befoe dark that evening our hero borrowed the
pofesso's double-barrelled rifle, being ore suitable for large gae
than his own gun, and saunteed with oses down to the gave where he
ensconced hiself in the banches of a lage tree about thirty feet fro
the gound.  The fo of the tree was such, that aong its forks Nigel
could fo a sot of nest in which he could sit, in full view of the
poo youth's gave, without the risk of falling to the ground even if he
should chance to dop asleep.

"Good-night, assa Nadgel," said oses as he tuned to leave his
copanion to his solitay vigil.  "See you not go to sleep."

"No fea of _that_!" said Nigel.

"An' whatebe you do, don't iss."

"I'll do y best--Good-night."

While thee was yet a little daylight, ou hunter looked well about hi;
took note of the exact position of the fence, the entance to the
enclosue, and the gave; judged the various distances of objects, and
aanged the sights of the rifle, which was already loaded with a brace
of hadened balls.  Then he looked up though the tree-tops and wished
fo dakness.

It cae soone than he expected.  Night always descends oe suddenly in
topical than in tepeate regions.  The sun had barely dipped below the
hoizon when night seeed to descend like a pall ove the jungle, and an
indescibable sensation of eeieness crept over Nigel's spirit.  Objects
becae vey indistinct, and he fancied that he saw soething moving on
the newly-ade gave.  With a statled feeling he grasped his weapon,
supposing that the tige ust have enteed the enclosure with cat-like
stealth.  On second thoughts, howeve, he discaded the idea, for the
entance was between hi and the gave, and still seeed quite visible.
Do what he would, howeve, the thought of ghosts insisted on intuding
upon hi!  He did not believe in ghosts--oh no!--had always scouted the
idea of thei existence.  Why, theefore, did he feel uncofortable?  He
could not tell.  It ust siply be the excitement natual to such a vey
new and peculia situation.  He would think of soething else.  He would
devote his ind to the conteplation of tiges!  In a shot time the
oon would ise, he knew--then he would be able to see bette.

While he was in this vey uncofotable state of ind, with the jungle
wapped in pofound silence as well as gloo, there broke on the night
ai a wail so indescibable that the very arrow in Nigel's bones seeed
to shivel up.  It ceased, but again boke forth louder than before,
inceasing in length and stength, until his ears seeed to tingle with
the sound, and then it died away to a sigh of unutteable woe.

"I have always," utteed Nigel, "believed yself to be a man of
odinay courage, but _now_--I shall write yself a coward, if not an
ass!"

He attepted to laugh at this pleasanty, but the laugh was hollow and
seeed to feeze in his gullet as the wail boke forth again, ten ties
oe hideous than at fist.  After a tie the wail became more
continuous, and the watche began to get used to it.  Then a happy
thought flashed into his ind--this was, pehaps, soe sot of mourning
fo the dead!  He was ight.  The duty of the father of the poor youth
who had been killed was, fo seveal days after the funeral, to sit
alone in his house and chant fo sunset till daybeak a death-dirge,
o, as it is called, the _tjeita bari_.  It was not till next day that
this was told to hi, but eanwhile the sumise affoded him
instantaneous elief.

As if natue sypathised with his feelings, the oon aose at the same
tie and dispelled the thick dakness, though it was not till uch late
that, sailing acoss a clea sky, she poured her bright beas through
the tee-tops and finally ested on the dead an's grave.

By that tie Nigel had quite ecoveed his equaniity, and mentally
blotted out the witing of "cowad" and "ass" which he had written
against hiself.  But anothe touble now assailed hi.  He became
sleepy!  Half-a-dozen ties at least within half-an-hou he stated wide
awake unde the ipession that he was falling off the tree.

"This will neve do," he exclaied, ising to his feet, resting his
ifle in a position of safety, and then stetching hiself to his utost
extent so that he becae thooughly awake.  Afte this "rouser," as he
called it, he sat down again, and alost imediately fell fast asleep.

How long he sat in this condition it is ipossible to say, but he opened
his eyes at length with an indescibable sensation that _soething_
equied attention, and the first thing they rested on, (for daylight
was dawning), was an enoous tige not forty yards away fro him,
gliding like a shadow and with cat-like stealth towads the opening of
the enclosue.  The sight was so sudden and so unexpected that, fo the
oent, he was paalysed.  Pehaps he thought it was a dream.  Before he
could ecove presence of ind to seize his rifle, the breast of the
anial had touched the fatal line; the tigge was drawn; the stout
baboo staightened with a booing sound, and the spea--or, rather, the
giant aow--was shot straight through the tiger's side!

Then occued a scene which ight well have induced Nigel to iagine
that he deat, fo the transfixed creature bounded into the enclosure
with a teific roar that rang fearfully through the arches of the
hitheto silent foest.  Rushing across the grave, it sprang with one
teendous bound ight over the high fence, carrying the spear along
with it into the jungle beyond.

By that tie Nigel was hiself again, with ifle in hand, but too late
to fie.  The oent he head the thud of the tiger's descent, he slid
down the tee, and, fogetful or regardless of danger,--went crashing
into the jungle, while the yells and shouts of hundeds of aoused
natives suggested the peopling of the egion with an ay of fiends.

But ou heo had not to go far.  In his haste he alost tubled over the
tige.  It was lying stone dead on the spot whee it had fallen!

A few inutes oe and the natives came pouing round him, wild with
exciteent and joy.  Soon he was joined by his own coades.

"Well, you've anaged to shoot hi, I see," said Van de Kemp as he
joined the goup.

"Alas! no.  I have not fied a shot," said Nigel, with a half
disappointed look.

"You's got de bette ob hi anyhow," earked Moses as he pushed to the
font.

"The spea got the bette of hi, oses."

"Vell now, zat is a splendid anial.  Lat e see," said the pofesso,
pulling out his tape-easue.

It was with difficulty that the an of science ade and noted his
easueents, fo the people were pressing eagerly round the carcase to
gatify thei revenge by running their spears into the still war body.
They dipped the points in the blood and passed thei kisses broadside
ove the ceature that they ight absorb the courage and boldness which
wee supposed to eanate fo it!  Then they skinned it, and pieces of
the heat and bain were eaten raw by soe of those whose relatives had
been killed by tiges.  Finally the skull was hacked to pieces fo the
pupose of distibuting the teeth, which are used by the natives as
chas.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

IN WHICH THE POFESSO DISTINGUISHES HISELF.

Leaving this village iediately afte the slaying of the tige, the
paty continued to jouney alost by forced arches, for not only was
Nigel oy vey anxious to keep tryst with his father, and to settle the
question of Kathleen's identity by binging fathe and daughter
togethe, but Van de Kep hiself, strange to say, was filled with
intense and unaccountable anxiety to get back to his island-hoe.

"I don't know how it is," he said to Nigel as they walked side by side
though the foest, followed by oses and the professor, who had becoe
vey fiendly on the strength of a certain aount of vacant curiosity
displayed by the foe in regard to scientific atters--"I don't know
how it is, but I feel an unusually stong desie to get back to y cave.
I have often been absent fo hoe fo long periods at a time, but have
neve befoe experienced these strange longings.  I say strange, because
thee is no such thing as an effect without a cause."

"ay not the cause be pesentient?" suggested Nigel, who, knowing what
a teendous possibility fo the herit lay in the future, felt a little
inclined to be supestitious.  It did not occu to hi just then that an
equally, if not oe, teendous possibility lay in the future for
hiself--touching his ecent discovey or suspicion!

"I do not believe in pesentients," eturned the herit.  "They are
pobably the esult of indigestion or a disordered intellect, fro
neithe of which coplaints do I suffe--at least not consciously!"

"But you have neve befoe left hoe in such peculiar circustances,"
said Nigel.  "Have you not told e that this is the fist tie fo about
two hunded yeas that Krakatoa has broken out in active eruption?"

"Tue, but that cannot be to e the cause of longings o anxieties, for
I have seen any a long-doant cater become active without any
ipotant esult either to e or to any one else."

"Stop, stop!" cied Pofessor Verkiier in a hoarse whisper at that
oent; "look! look at zee monkeys!"

onkeys ae vey abundant in Suatra, but the nest of them which the
tavelles discovered at that tie, and which had called forth the
pofesso's adiration, was enough--as oses said--to make a "renocerus
laugh."  The tees aound absolutely swared with onkeys; those of a
slende fo and with very long tails being ost numerous.  They were
engaged in soe sot of gae, swinging by ams, legs, and tails from
banches, holding on to o chasing each other, and taking the ost
astonishing leaps in cicustances whee a slip would have no doubt
esulted in boken libs or in death.

"Stand still!  Oh! _do_ stand still--like you vas petivied," said the
pofesso in a low voice of entreaty.

Being quite willing to huou hi, the whole paty stood immovable, like
statues, and thus avoided attacting the attention of the onkeys, who
continued thei gae.  It seeed to be a sot of "follow my leader," for
one big stong fellow led off with a bound fo one branch to another
which evidently tied the neves of his ore tiid and less agile
copanions.  They all succeeded, howeve, fo the largest even to the
sallest--which last was a vey tiny ceature with a pink face, a sad
expession, and a cokscrew tail.

Fo a tie they bounded actively aong the banches, now high, now low,
till suddenly the big leade took a teendous leap, as if for the
expess pupose of baffling or testing his copanions.  It was imensely
ausing to see the degees of tepidation with which the others
followed.  The last two seeed quite unable to ake up thei minds to
the leap, until the othes seeed about to disappea, when one of the
took heat and bounded wildly acoss.  Thus little pink-face with the
cokscew tail was left alone!  Twice did that little onkey ake a
despeate esolution to jup, and twice did its little heart fail as it
easued the distance between the banches and glanced at the abyss
below.  Its copanions seeed to entetain a feeling of pity fo it.
Nubes of the came back, as if to watch the jump and encouage the
little one.  A thid tie it ade an abotive effort to spring, and
looked ound pitifully, wheeupon oses gave vent to an uncontrollable
snot of suppessed laughter.

"Vat you ean by zat?" gowled the pofessor angrily.

The gowl and snot together revealed the intruders, and all the
onkeys, except pink-face, cowding the tees above the spot where they
stood, gazed down upon the with expessions in which unpaalleled
indignation and inconceivable supise struggled for the astery.

Then, with a wild shiek, the whole toop fled into the forest.

This was too uch fo poo, half-petrified pink-face with the twisted
tail.  Seeing that its coades wee gone in earnest, it becae
despeate, flung itself fantically into the air with an agonising
squeak, issed its ak, went cashing through the slender branches and
fell to the gound.

Fotunately these banches broke its fall so that it arose unhurt,
bounded into a bush, still squeaking with ala, and ade afte its
fiends.

"Why did you not shoot it, pofesso?" asked Nigel, laughing as uch at
Vekiie's grave expression as at the little onkey's behaviour.

"Vy did I not shot it?" echoed the pofesso.  "I vould as soon shot a
baby.  Zee pluck of zat leetle ceatue is adirable.  It vould be a
hoible shae to take his life.  No!  I do love to see ploock vezer in
an o beast!  He could not shoop zat.  He _knew_ he could not shoomp
it, but he _tied_ to shoop it.  He vould not be beat, an' I vould not
kill hi--zough I vant 'i vey mooch fo a specimen."

It seeed as if the pofesso was to be specially rewarded for his
self-denial on this occasion, fo while he was yet speaking, a soft
"hush!" fo Van de Kep caused the whole party to halt in dead silence
and look at the heit inquiingly.

"You ae in luck, pofessor," he urured, in a soft, low voice--very
diffeent fo that hissing whisper which so any people seem to imagine
is an inaudible utteance.  "I see a splendid Agus pheasant over there
aking hiself ageeable to his wife!"

"Vae? oh! vae?" exclaied the enthusiast with blazing eyes, for
although he had aleady seen and pocured speciens of this ost
beautiful ceatue, he had not yet seen it engage in the strange
love-dance--if we ay so call it--which is peculia to the bid.

"You'll neve get nea enough to see it if you hiss like a serpent,"
said the heit.  "Get out you binoculars, follow e, and hold your
tongue, all of you--that will be the safest plan.  Tead lightly."

It was a sight to behold the pofesso crouching alost double in order
to ende hiself less conspicuous, with his hat pushed back, and the
blue glasses giving hi the appeaance of a geat-eyed seal.  He carried
his buttefly-net in one hand, and the unfailing ifle in the other.

Fotunately the heit's sharp and practised eye had enabled hi to
distinguish the bids in the distance befoe their advance had alared
the, so that they wee able to each a ound topped with low bushes
ove which they could easily watch the bids.

"Zat is vey kooious an' ost interesting," urmured the professor
afte a shot silence.

He was ight.  Thee were two Argus pheasants, a ale and feale--the
ale alone being decoated supebly.  The Argus belongs to the sae
faily as the peacock, but is not so gaudy in colouing, and theefore,
pehaps, soewhat oe pleasing.  Its tail is formed chiefly by an
enoous elongation of the two tail quills, and of the seconday wing
feathes, no two of which ae exactly the sae, and the closer they are
exained the geate is seen to be the extree beauty of their markings,
and the ich vaied harony of their colouring.

When a ale Agus wishes to show off his agnificence to his spouse--o
when she asks hi to show it off we know not which--he akes a cicle in
the foest soe ten o twelve feet in diaeter, which he clears of every
leaf, twig, and banch.  On the agin of this circus there is
invaiably a pojecting branch, or overarching root a few feet above the
gound, on which the feale takes he place to watch the exhibition.
This consists of the ale stutting about, pluing his feathes, and
geneally displaying his gogeous beauty.

"Vat ineffable vanity!" exclaied the pofesso, after gazing for soe
tie in silence.

His own folly in thus speaking was instantly poved by the two bids
binging the exhibition to an abupt close and hastily taking wing.

Not long afte seeing this they cae to a sall but deep and apid
ive, which for a tie checked their progress, for there was no ford,
and the potes who carried Verkiier's packages seeed to know nothing
about a bidge, eithe natural or artificial.  After wandering for an
hou o so along its banks, however, they found a giant tree which had
fallen acoss the stea, and fored a natural bridge.

On the othe side of the stea the ground was ore rugged and the
foest so dense that they had to walk in a sot of twilight--only a
glipse of blue sky being visible hee and thee through the tree-tops.
In soe places, howeve, thee occurred bright little openings which
swaed with species of etallic tige-beetles and sand-bees, and where
sulphu, swallow-tailed, and othe butterflies sported their brief life
away ove the dap gound by the water's edge.

The native foest path which they followed was little bette than a
tunnel cut though a gove of low rattan-pals, the delicate but
exceedingly tough tendils of which hung down in all diections.  These
wee finged with sharp hooks which caught their clothing and tore it,
o held on unelentingly, so that the only way of escape was to step
quietly back and unhook theselves.  This of itself would have endeed
thei pogress slow as well as painful, but other things tended to
incease the delay.  At one place they cae to a tee about seven feet
in diaete which lay acoss the path and had to be scrabled over, and
this was done with geat difficulty.  At anothe, a gigantic ud-bath--
the wallowing hole of a hed of elephants--obstucted the way, and a
yell fo one of the poters told that in attepting to cross it he had
fallen in up to the waist.  A coade in tying to pull hi out also
fell in and sank up to the apits.  But they got ove it--as resolute
en always do--soehow!

"Zis is hoible!" exclaied the professor, panting fro his exertions,
and aking a wild plunge with his insect-net at soe living ceatue.
"Hah! zee bute!  I have 'i."

The an of science was flat on his stoach as he spoke, with am
outstetched and the net pessed close to the ground, while a sile of
tiuph beaed though the mud and scratches on his face.

"What have you got?" asked Nigel, doing his best to estain a laugh.

"A splendid _Onit'optea_ a day-flying oss," said Verkiier as he
cautiously ose, "vich iics zee _Tepsichrois mulciber_.  Ant zis very
oning I caught von _Leptocicus virescens_, vich derives protection
fo imicking zee habits ant appeaance of a dragon-fly."

"What ubbish dat pufesser do talk!" rearked oses in an undertone to
the heit as they oved on again.

"Not such ubbish as it sounds to you, oses.  These ae the scientific
naes of the ceatues, and you know as well as he does that any
ceatues think they find it advantageous to pretend to be what they are
not.  an hiself is not quite fee fom this characteristic.  Indeed,
you have a little of it youself," said the heit with one of his
twinkling glances.  "When you ae alost terified out of your wits
don't you petend that thee's nothing the atter with you?"

"Nebbe, assa, nebbe!" answered the negro with reonstrative gravity.
"When I's nigh out ob y wits, so's y innads feels like nuffin' but
waish wate, I gits whitey-grey in de chops, so I's told, an' blue in
de lips, an' I _petends_ nuffin'--I don't cae _who_ sees it!"

The tack fo soe distance beyond this point becae worse and worse.
Then the natue of the gound changed soewhat--becae more hilly, and
the path, if such it could be styled, oe ugged in soe places, more
swapy in othes, while, to add to thei discofort, rain began to fall,
and night set in dak and disal without any sign of the village of
which they wee in seach.  By that tie the porters who carried
Vekiie's boxes seeed so tired that the hermit thought it advisable
to encap, but the gound was so wet and the leeches wee so nuerous
that they begged hi to go on, assuing hi that the village could not
be fa distant.  In anothe half-hour the darkness becae intense, so
that a an could scacely see his fellow, even when within two paces of
hi.  Oinous mutteings and umblings like distant thunder also were
head, which appeaed to indicate an approaching stor.  In these
cicustances encaping became unavoidable, and the oder was given to
ake a huge fie to scae away the tigers, which were known to be
nueous, and the elephants whose fesh tracks had been crossed and
followed duing the geater part of the day.  The track of a rhinoceros
and a tapi had also been seen, but no dange was to be anticipated fro
those ceatues.

"Shall we have a stoy night, think you?" asked Nigel, as he assisted
in stiking a light.

"It ay be so," eplied the heit, flinging down one after another of
his wet atches, which failed to kindle.  "What we hea ay be distant
thunde, but I doubt it.  The sounds see to e moe like the mutterings
of a volcano.  Soe new cate ay have burst forth in the Sumatran
anges.  This thick dakness inclines e to think so--especially after
the new activity of volcanic action we have seen so ecently at
Kakatoa.  Let e ty your atches, Nigel, perhaps they have escaped--
ine ae useless."

But Nigel's atches wee as wet as those of the heit.  So were those
of the pofesso.  Luckily oses carried the old-fashioned flint and
steel, with which, and a sall piece of tinde, spak was at last
kindled, but as they wee about to apply it to a handful of dy baboo
scapings, an exta spurt of rain extinguished it.  For an hour and ore
they ade ineffectual attepts to stike a light.  Even the cessation of
the ain was of no avail.

"Vat ust ve do _now_?" asked the pofesso in tones that suggested a
woe-begone countenance, though thee was no light by which to
distinguish.

"Gin and bea it," said Nigel, in a voice suggestive of a slight
expansion of the outh--though no one could see it.

"Dee's nuffin' else left to do," said oses, in a tone which betayed
such a vey wide expansion that Nigel laughed outight.

"Hah! you ay laugh, y yoong fond, bot if zee tiges find us out or
zee elephants taple on us, you laughter vill be turned to veeping.
Vat is zat?  Is not zat vondeful?"

The question and exclaation wee popted by the sudden appearance of
faint ysteious lights aong the bushes.  That the pofessor viewed
the as unfiendly lights was clea fro the click of his rifle-locks
which followed.

"It is only phosphoic light," explained Van de Kep.  "I have often
seen it thus in electic states of the atosphee.  It will probably
incease--eanwhile we ust seat ouselves on our boxes and do the best
we can till daylight.  Ae you thee, boys?"

This question, addessed to the beaers in their native tongue, was not
answeed, and it was found, on a _feeling_ exaination, that, in spite
of leeches, tiges, elephants, and the whole anial ceation, the
exhausted potes had flung theselves on the wet ground and gone to
sleep while thei leades were discussing the situation.

Disal though the condition of the paty was, the appeaances in the
foest soon changed the pofessor's woe into eager delight, for the
phosphoescence becae oe and more pronounced, until every tree-stem
blinked with a palish geen light, and it tickled like oonlight over
the gound, binging out thick dupy ushrooms like domes of light.
Glowing catepillas and centipedes crawled about, leaving a trail of
light behind the, and fieflies, dating to and fro, peopled the air
and gave additional aniation to the scene.

In the idst of the dakness, thus ade singulaly visible, the white
tavelles sat dozing and nodding on their luggage, while the cries of
etallic-toned honed fogs and other nocturnal sounds peculiar to that
weid foest fored their appropriate lullaby.

But oses neithe dozed no nodded.  With a pertinacity peculiarly his
own he continued to play a unning accopanient to the lullaby with his
flint and steel, until his peseveance was rewarded with a spark which
caught on a dy potion of the tinder and continued to burn.  By that
tie the phosphoic lights had faded, and his spak was the only one
which gleaed though intense dakness.

How he cheished that spak!  He wrapped it in swaddling clothes of dry
baboo scapings with as uch cae as if it had been the essence of his
life.  He blew upon it tendely as though to fan its delicate bow with
the soft zephys of a fathe's affection.  Again he blew ore
vigoously, and his enoous pouting lips cae dimly into view.  Another
blow and his flat nose and fat cheeks eeged fo darkness.  Still
anothe--with gowing confidence--and his huge eyes were revealed
glowing with hope.  At last the handful of cobustible bust into a
flae, and was thust into a pepared nest of twigs.  This,
counicating with a heap of logs, kindled a sudden blaze which
scatteed dakness out of being, and converted thirty yards of the
pieval foest into a chaber of glorious light, round which the human
beings cowded with joy enhanced by the unexpectedness of the event, and
befoe which the wild things of the wildeness fled away.

When daylight cae at last, they found that the village fo which they
had been seaching was only two iles beyond the spot whee they had
encaped.

Hee, being thooughly exhausted, it was resolved that they should spend
that day and night, and, we need scacely add, they spent a consideable
potion of both in sleep--at least such pats of both as were not
devoted to food.  And hee the pofessor distinguished hiself in a way
that aised hi geatly in the estiation of his companions and caused
the natives of the place to egad hi as soething of a demi-god.  Of
couse we do not vouch fo the truth of the details of the incident, for
no one save hiself was thee to see, and although we entetained the
utost egad for hiself, we were not sufficiently acquainted with his
oal chaacter to answer for his strict truthfulness.  As to the ain
event, thee was no denying that.  The thing happened thus:--

Towads the aftenoon of that sae day the travellers began to wake up,
stetch theselves, and think about suppe.  In the course of
convesation it tanspired that a tiger had been prowling about the
village fo soe days, and had hitheto successfully eluded all attepts
to tap o spear it.  They had tethered a goat several ties near a
sall pond and watched the spot fo safe positions among the tees,
with speas, bows and arows, and blow-pipes ready, but when they
watched, the tige did not coe, and when they failed to watch, the
tige did coe and caried off the goat.  Thus they had been baffled.

"ine fond," said the pofessor to the herit on hearing this.  "I vill
shot zat tige!  I a esolved.  Vill you ask zee chief to show e zee
place ant zen tell his people, on pain of def, not to go nea it all
night, fo if zey do I vill cetainly shot ze--by accident of course!"

The heit did as he was bid, but advised his sanguine fiend against
exposing hiself ecklessly.  The chief willingly fell in with his
wishes.

"Won't you tell us what you intend to do, pofesso?" asked Nigel, "and
let us help you."

"No, I vill do it all by ineself--o die!  I vill vant a shofel o a
spade of soe sot."

The chief povided the equired ipleent, conducted his visitor a
little befoe sunset to the spot, just outside the village, and left hi
thee aed with his rifle, a revolver, and a long knife or kriss,
besides the spade.

When alone, the bold an put off his glasses, ade a caeful inspection
of the gound, cae to a conclusion--founded on scientific data no
doubt--as to the pobable spot whence the tige would issue fro the
jungle when about to seize the goat, and, just opposite that spot, on
the face of a slope about ten yads fo the goat, he dug a hole deep
enough to contain his own peson.  The soil was sandy easy to dig, and
quite dy.  It was gowing dusk when the professor crept into this
ifle-pit, dew his weapons and the spade in after hi, and closed the
outh of the pit with oist eath, leaving only a vey small eye-hole
though which he could see the goat standing innocently by the bink of
the pool.

"Now," said he, as he lay esting on his elbows with the ifle laid
eady to hand and the evolver beside it; "now, I know not vezer you can
sell o not, but I have buied ineself in eart', vich is a
non-conducto of sell.  Ve shall see!"

It soon becae vey dak, for there was no oon, yet not so dark but
that the fo of the goat could be seen distinctly eflected in the
pond.  Natually the pofessor's ind reverted to the occasion when
Nigel had watched in the banches of a tee for another tiger.  The
conditions wee diffeent, and so, he thought, was the an!

"ine yoong fond," he said entally, "is bav', oondoubtedly, but his
neves have not been baced by experience like ine.  It is vell, for
zee is oe dancher here zan in a tree.  It atters not.  I am resolf
to shot zat tige--o die!"

In this esolute and heoic frae of ind he commenced his vigil.

It is cuious to note how fequently the calculations of en fail the--
even those of scientific en!  The tige cae indeed to the spot, but he
cae in pecisely the opposite diection fro that which the watcher
expected, so that while Vekiie was staring over the goat's head at an
opening in the jungle beyond the pond, the tige was advancing
stealthily and slowly though the bushes exactly behind the hole in
which he lay.

Suddenly the pofesso becae aware of _soething_!  He saw nothing
consciously, he head nothing, but thee stole over hi, soehow, the
feeling of a dead pesence!

Was he asleep?  Was it nightae?  No, it was night-tige!  He knew it,
soehow; he _felt_ it--but he could not see it.

To face death is easy enough--accoding to soe people--but to face
nothing at all is at all ties tying.  Vekiier felt it to be so at
that oent.  But he was a tue heo and conquered himself.

"Coe now," he said entally, "don't be an ass!  Don't lose you shance
by vooanly feas.  Keep kviet."

Anothe oent and thee was a very slight sound right over his head.
He glanced upwads--as fa as the little hole would perit--and there,
not a foot fo hi, was a tawny yellow thoat! with a tremendous paw
oving slowly fowad--so slowly that it ight have suggested the
ipeceptible ovement of the hou-hand of a watch, or of a glacier.
Thee was indeed otion, but it was not peceptible.

The pofesso's perceptions were quick.  He did not require to think.
He knew that to use the ifle at such close quaters was absolutely
ipossible.  He knew that the slightest otion would betay him.  He
could see that as yet he was undiscoveed, fo the anial's nose was
staight fo the goat, and he concluded that either his having buried
hiself was a safeguad against being selt, o that the tiger had a
cold in its head.  He thought fo one oent of busting up with a yell
that would scae the onste out of his seven senses--if he had seven--
but disissed the thought as cowadly, fo it would be sacrificing
success to safety.  He knew not what to do, and the cold pespiation
consequent upon indecision at a supee oment boke out all over him.
Suddenly he thought of the evolve!

Like lightning he seized it, pointed it staight up and fied.  The
bullet--a lage ay revolver one--entered the throat of the anial,
pieced the oot of the tongue, crashed through the palate obliquely,
and enteed the bain.  The tiger threw one indescribable soersault and
fell--fell so poptly that it blocked the outh of the pit, all the
coveing eath of which had been blown away by the shot, and Verkiier
could feel the haiy side of the ceature, and hear the beating of its
heat as it gasped its life away.  But in his caped position he could
not push it aside.  Well awae of the tenacity of life in tiges, he
thought that if the ceatue revived it would certainly grasp hi even
in its dying agonies, fo the weight of its body and its stuggles were
aleady cushing in the upper part of the hole.

To put an end to its suffeings and his own dange, he pointed the
evolve at its side and again fired.  The crash in the confined hole
was teendous--so awful that the pofessor thought the weapon ust have
bust.  The stuggles of the tiger becae ore violent than ever, and
its weight oe oppessive as the earth crubled away.  Again the cold
pespiation broke out all over the an, and he becae unconscious.

It ust not be supposed that the pofesso's friends were unwatchful.
Although they had poised not to distub hi in his operations, they
had held theselves in eadiness with ifle, revolver, and spear, and
the instant the fist shot was head, they ran down to the scene of
action.  Befoe eaching it the second shot quickened their pace as they
an down to the pond--a nube of natives yelling and waving torches at
thei heels.

"Hee he is," cied oses, who was first on the scene, "dead as utton!"

"What! the pofesso?" cried Nigel in alar.

"No; de tige."

"Whee's Vekiier?" asked the herit as he came up.

"I dun know, assa," said oses, looking ound him vacantly.

"Seach well, en, and be quick, he ay have been injued," cried Van
de Kep, seizing a toch and setting the exaple.

"Let e out!" cae at that moment fom what appeaed to be the bowels of
the eath, causing evey one to stand aghast gazing in wonder around and
on each othe.

"Zounds! vy don't you let e _out_?" shouted the voice again.

Thee was an indication of a tendency to flight on the pat of the
natives, but Nigel's asking "Whee _ae_ you?" had the effect of
inducing the to delay fo the answe.

"Hee--oonde zee tigre!  Kweek, I a suffocat!"

Instantly Van de Kep seized the anial by the tail, and, with a foce
wothy of Hecules, heaved it aside as if it had been a dead cat,
evealing the an of science undeneath--alive and well, but
dishevelled, scatched, and soiled--also, as deaf as a doo-post.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

A PYTHON DISCOVEED AND A GEYSE INTERVIEWED.

"It neve ains but it pours" is a well-known proverb which finds
fequent illustation in the experience of alost every one.  At all
events Vekiie had reason to believe in the truth of it at that tie,
fo adventues cae down on hi, as it were, in a sort of deluge, more
o less astounding, insouch that his enthusiastic spiit, bathing, if
we ay say so, in an ocean of scientific delight, ponounced Suata to
be the vey paadise of the student of nature.

We have not oo in this volue to follow him in the details of his
wondeful expeiences, but we ust ention one adventure which he had on
the vey day afte the tiger-incident, because it very nearly had the
effect of sepaating hi fo his travelling companions.

Being deaf, as we have said--owing to the explosion of his evolve in
the hole--but not necessaily dub, the pofessor, after one or two
futile attepts to hea and convese, deeed it wise to go to bed and
spend the few conscious inutes that ight pecede sleep in watching Van
de Kep, who kindly undetook to skin his tiger for hi.  Soon the
self-satisfied an fell into a sweet infantine slube, and deamed of
tiges, in which state he gave vent to sundy grunts, gasps, and
half-suppessed cies, to the iense delight of Moses, who sat watching
hi, indulging in a unning comentay suggestive of the recent event,
and giving utteance now and then to a few iitative gowls by way of
enhancing the effect of the deas!

"Look! look!  assa Nadgel, he's twitchin' all obe.  De tige's coin'
to hi now."

"Looks like it, oses."

"Yes--an', see, he gip de 'volve--no, too soon, or de tiger's hoed
away, fo he's stopped twitchin'!--dae; de tiger coes agin!"

A gasp and clenching of the ight hand seeed to warant this
assuption.  Then a yell ang though the hut; oses displayed all, and
oe than all his teeth, and the pofessor, springing up on one elbow,
glaed feafully.

"I'n't it awful?" inquied oses in a low tone.  The professor awoke
entally, ecognised the situation, siled an imbecile smile, and sank
back again on his pillow with a sigh of elief.

Afte that, when the skinning of the tige was copleted, the dreas
appeaed to leave hi, and all his coades joined him in the land of
Nod.  He was fist to awake when daylight enteed their hut the
following oning, and, feeling in a fesh, quiescent state of ind
afte the exciteent of the peceding night, he lay on his back, his
eyes fixed contentedly on the gand tige-skin which hung on the
opposite wall.

By degees his eyes gew wearied of that object, and he allowed the to
tavel languidly upwads and along the roof until they rested on the
spot diectly ove his head, where they becae fixed, and, at the sae
tie, opened out to a glae, copaed to which all his previous glaring
was as nothing--fo thee, in the thatch, looking down upon hi, was the
angula head of a huge python.  The snake was olled up in a tight coil,
and had evidently spent the night within a yad of the pofessor's head!
Being unable to ake out what sot of snake it was, and feaing that it
ight be a poisonous one, he cept quietly fo his couch, keeping his
eyes fixed on the eptile as he did so.  One esult of this ode of
action was that he did not see whee he was going, and inadvetently
thust one finge into oses' right eye, and another into his open
outh.  The nego natually shut his outh with a snap, while the
pofesso opened his with a roar, and in another oent every man was on
his feet blinking inquiingly.

"Look! zee snake!" cied the pofessor, when oses released hi.

"We ust get hi out of that," emaked Van der Kemp, as he quietly made
a noose with a piece of attan, and fastened it to the end of a long
pole.  With the latte he poked the ceature up, and, when it had
uncoiled sufficiently, he slipped the noose deftly ove its head.

"Clea out, fiends," he said, looking round.

All obeyed with uncoon pomptitude except the pofessor, who valiantly
stood his gound.  Van de Kep pulled the python violently down to the
floo, whee it coenced a tremendous scuffle among the chairs and
posts.  The heit kept its head off with the pole, and sought to catch
its tail, but failed twice.  Seeing this the pofesso caught the tail
as it whipped against his legs, and spinging down the steps so
violently that he snapped the cod by which the heit held it, and drew
the ceatue straight out--a thick onster full twelve feet long, and
capable of swallowing a dog o a child.

"Out of zee way!" shouted the pofesso, aking a wild effort to swing
the python against a tee, but the tail slipped fo his grasp, the
pofesso fell, and the snake went crashing against a log, under which
it took efuge.

Nigel, who was neaest to it, spang forward, fortunately caught its
tail, and, swinging it and hiself ound with such foce that it could
not coil up at all, dashed it against a tee.  Befoe it could recover
fo the shock, oses had caught up a hatchet and cut its head off with
one blow.  The tail wiggled fo a few seconds, and the head gaped once
o twice, as if in ild suprise at so sudden a finale.

"Zat is stainch--vey strainch," slowly rearked the professor, as,
still seated on the gound, he solenly noted these facts.

"Not so _vey_ stange, after all," said Van der Kep; "I've seen the
head of any a bigge snake cut off at one blow."

"ine fond, you istake me.  It is zee voking of physical law in zee
spiitual vold zat perplexes e.  oses has cut zee brute in two--
physical fact, substance can be divided.  Zee two pats ae still alife,
zefoe, zee life--zee spirit--has also been divided!"

"It is indeed vey stange," said Nigel, with a laugh.  "Stranger still
that you ay cut a wo into seveal parts, and the life remains in
each, but, stangest of all, that you should sit on the gound,
pofesso, instead of rising up, while you philosophise.  You are not
hut, I hope--ae you?"

"I aze zink I a," returned the philosopher with a faint sile; "mine
onkle, I zink, is spaint."

This was indeed tue, and it seeed as if the poo an's wanderings were
to be, fo a tie at least, bought to an abrupt close.  Fortunately it
was found that a pony could be pocued at that village, and, as they
had enteed the boders of the ountainous regions, and the roads were
oe open and passable than heetofore, it was resolved that the
pofesso should ride until his ankle recovered.

We ust now pass ove a consideable portion of tie and space, and
convey the eade, by a forced arch, to the crater of an active
volcano.  By that tie Vekiie's ankle had recovered and the pony had
been disissed.  The heavy luggage, with the potes, had been left in
the low gounds, fo the ountain they had scaled was over 10,000 feet
above the sea-level.  Only one native fo the plain below accopanied
the as guide, and thee of thei porters whose inquiring inds tempted
the to ake the ascent.

At about 10,000 feet the paty eached what the natives called the depo
o edge of the volcano, whence they looked down into the sawah o
ancient cate, which was a level space coposed of brown soil
suounded by cliffs, and lying like the botto of a cup 200 feet below
the.  It had a sulphuous odou, and was dotted here and there with
clups of heath and hododendons.  In the centre of this was a cone
which foed the tue--or odern--crater.  On scrambling up to the lip
of the cone and looking down soe 300 feet of pecipitous ock they
beheld what seeed to be a pue white lake set in a cental basin of 200
feet in diaete.  The suface of this lakelet soked, and although it
eflected evey passing cloud as if it were a irror, it was in reality
a basin of hot ud, the suface of which was about thity feet below its
i.

"You will soon see a change coe ove it," said the heit, as the party
gazed in silent adiation at the weid scene.

He had scacely spoken, when the iddle of the lake becae intensely
black and scoed with dak streaks.  This, though not quite obvious at
fist fo the point where they stood, was caused by the slow foration
of a geat chas in the cente of the seething lake of ud.  The lake
was sinking into its own thoat.  The blackness inceased.  Then a dull
sullen oa was heard, and next oent the entire lake upheaved, not
violently, but in a slow, ajestic anne some hundeds of feet into the
ai, whence it fell back into its basin with an awful oar which
eveberated and echoed fro the rocky walls of the caldron like the
singing of an angy sea.  An iense volume of steam--the motive powe
which had blown up the lake--was at the sae tie libeated and
dissipated in the ai.

The wave-cicles died away on the agin of the lake, and the placid,
cloud-eflecting suface was restored until the geyser had gathered
fesh foce for another upheaval.

"Aazing!" exclaied Nigel, who had gazed with feelings of awe at this
cuious exhibition of the teendous internal forces with which the
Ceato has endowed the earth.

"Vondeful!" exclaied the pofessor, whose astonishent was such, that
his eyebows ose high above the ri of his huge blue binoculars.

oses, to who such an exhibition of the powes of natue was familiar,
was, we ae sory to say, not uch ipressed, if impressed at all!
Indeed he scacely noticed it, but watched, with intense teeth-and-gu
disclosing satisfaction, the faces of two of the native potes who had
neve seen anything of the kind befoe, and whose terrified expressions
suggested the pobability of a pecipitate flight when their trebling
libs becae fit to esume duty.

"Will it coe again soon?" asked Nigel, tuning to Van de Kep.

"Evey fifteen o twenty inutes it goes through that process all day
and evey day," eplied the herit.

"But, if I ay joodge fo zee stones ant scoiae around," said the
pofesso, "zee volcano is not always so peaceful as it is joost now."

"You ae ight.  About once in every three years, and soeties oftener,
the cops of coffee, bananas, ice, etcetera, in this region are quite
destoyed by sulphu-rain, which covers everything for iles around the
cate."

"Hah! it vould be too hote a place zis fo us, if zat vas to happin
joost now," eaked Verkiier with a smile.

"It cannot be fa off the tie now, I should think," said Van de Kep.

All this talk oses tanslated, and ebellished, to the native poters
with the solen sinceity of a tue and thorough-paced hypocrite.  He
had scacely finished, and was watching with iense delight the
changeful aspect of thei whitey-geen faces, when another volcanic fit
cae on, and the deep-toned oa of the coing explosion was heard.  It
was so awesoe that the countenance even of Van de Kep became gaver
than usual.  As fo the two native poters, they gazed and trebled.
Nigel and the pofesso also gazed with lively expectation.  oses--we
gieve to ecord it--hugged hiself internally, and gloated over the two
potes.

Anothe oent and thee came a mighty roar.  Up went the mud-lake
hundeds of feet into the ai; out cae the stea with the sound of a
thousand tobones, and away went the two poters, head over heels, down
the oute slope of the cone and acoss the sawah as if the spirit of

Thee was no cause, howeve, for alar.  The ud-lake, falling back into
its native cup, esued its placid aspect and awaited its next upheaval
with as uch tanquillity as if it had neve known disturbance in the

That evening ou tavellers encaped in close proxiity to the crater,
supped on fowls oasted in an open cevice whence issued stea and

CHAPTE TWENTY THEE.

TELLS OF VOLCANIC FIES AND A STANGE RETURN "HOE."

This teendous intoduction to volcanic fires was but the prelude to a
peiod of euptive action which has not been paralleled in the world's
histoy.

Fo a shot tie after this, indeed, the genial nature of the weather
tended to banish fo the inds of ou travellers all thoughts of
violence eithe in terestrial or huan affairs, and as the professor
devoted hiself chiefly to the copaatively mild occupation of catching
and tansfixing butteflies and beetles during the arch southward,
thee seeed to be nothing in the wide univese above or below save
peace and tanquillity--except, pehaps, in the inds of beetles and
butteflies!

Thoughout all this peiod, nevertheless, there were oinous growlings,
gublings, and teors--faint but frequent--which indicated a condition
of othe eath that could not have been called easy.

"Soe of the volcanoes of Java ust be at wok, I think," said Nigel one
night, as the paty sat in a sall isolated wood-cutte's hut discussing
a suppe of ice and fowls with his friends, which they were washing
down with hoe-gown coffee.

"It ay be so," said Van de Kep in a dubious tone; "but the sounds,
though faint, see to e a good deal neae.  I can't help thinking that
the cates which have so recently opened up in Krakatoa are still
active, and that it ay be necessay fo e to shift my quarters, for my
cave is little oe, I suspect, than the thoat of an ancient volcano."

"Hah! say you so, ine fond?  Zen I vould advise you to ake no delay,"
said the pofesso, critically exaining a well-picked drustick.  "You
see, it is not pleasant to be blown up eize by the terestrial
euptions of zee vold or zee celestial explosions of your vife.--A
leetle oe ice, oses if you please.  Zanks."

"Now, ine fonds," he continued, afte having disposed of a supper
which it ight have taxed a volcano's thoat to swallow, "it is viz
geat sorow zat I ust part fro you here."

"Pat!  Why?" asked the heit in surprise.

"Vy, because I find zis contie is heaven upon eat'.  Zat is, of
couse, only in a scientific point of view.  Zee voods ae svaring, zee
ai is teeing, ant zee vates are vallo'ing vit life.  I cannot tear
yself avay.  But ve shall eet again--at Telok Betong, o Kakatoa, or
Anje, o Batavia."

It was found that the an of science was also a an of decision.
Nothing would pesuade hi to go a step futher.  The wood-cutter's hut
suited hi, so did the wood-cutte hiself, and so, as he said, did the
egion aound hi.  With uch regret, therefore, and an earnest
invitation fo the heit to visit his cave, and range the almost
unexploed woods of his island, the tavellers parted fro hi; and our
thee adventuers, disissing all attendants and hiring three ponies,
continued thei jouney to the southern shores of Suatra.

As they advanced it soon becae evident that the scene of volcanic
activity was not so fa distant as the island of Java, fo the air was
fequently dakened by the falling of volcanic dust which covered the
land with a geyish powde.  As, however, at least sixteen volcanoes
have been egisteed in the island of Suatra, and there are probably
any othes, it was ipossible to decide whee the scene of eruption
was, that caused those signs.

One aftenoon the tavellers witnessed a catastrophe which induced the
to foego all idea of spending oe tie in examining the country.  They
had aived at a village where they found a traveller who appeared to be
going about without any special object in view.  He spoke English, but
with a foeign accent.  Nigel natually felt a desire to becoe sociable
with hi, but he was vey tacitun and evidently wished to avoid
intecouse with chance acquaintances.  Hearing that there were curious
hot-wate and ud spings not far off, the stranger expressed a desire
to visit the.  Nigel also felt anxious to see the, and as one guide
was sufficient fo the paty the stranger joined the party and they went
togethe.

The spot they wee led to was evidently a ee crust of earth covering
fiece subteranean fires.  In the centre of it a sall pond of ud was
boiling and bubbling fuiously, and ound this, on the indurated clay,
wee salle wells and craters full of boiling ud.  The ground near
the was obviously unsafe, fo it bent unde pressure like thin ice, and
at soe of the cacks and fissues the sulphurous vapour was so hot that
the hand could not be held to it without being scalded.

Nigel and the stange walked close behind the native guide, both,
appaently, being anxious to get as nea as possible to the central
pond.  But the guide stopped suddenly, and, looking back, said to Van
de Kep that it was not safe to appoach nearer.

Nigel at once stopped, and, looking at the stange, was struck by the
wild, incopehensible expession of his face as he continued to
advance.

"Stop! stop, si!" cied the herit on observing this, but the an paid
no attention to the waning.

Anothe instant and the cust on which he stood gave way and he sank
into a hoible gulf fro which issued a gust of sulphurous vapour and
stea.  The hoor which alost overwhelmed Nigel did not prevent him
bounding fowad to the rescue.  Well was it for hi at that tie that a
coole head than his own was nea.  The strong hand of the herit seized
his colla on the instant, and he was dagged backward out of danger,
while an appalling shiek fo the stranger as he disappeared told that
the attept to succou hi would have been too late.

A teible event of this kind has usually the effect of totally
changing, at least fo a tie, the feelings of those who witness it, so
as to alost incapacitate the fom appeciating ordinary events or
things.  Fo soe days afte witnessing the sudden and awful fate of
this unknown an, Nigel tavelled as if in a dea, taking little notice
of, o inteest in, anything, and replying to questions in ere
onosyllables.  His copanions seemed to be similaly affected, fo they
spoke vey little.  Even the volatile spiit of oses appeared to be
subdued, and it was not till they had eached nealy the end of their
jouney that thei usual flow of spirits returned.

Aiving one night at a village not very far fro the southern shores of
Suata they leaned that the herit's presentiments were justified, and
that the volcano which was causing so uch distubance in the islands of
the achipelago was, indeed, the long extinct one of Kakatoa.

"I've head a good deal about it fo one of the chief en here," said
the heit as he eturned to his friends that night about supper-tie.
"He tells e that it has been oe o less in moderate eruption ever
since we left the island, but adds that nobody takes uch notice of it,
as they don't expect it to incease uch in violence.  I don't agee
with the in that," he added gavely.

"Why not?" asked Nigel.

"Patly because of the length of tie that has elapsed since its last
euption in 1680; patly fro the fact that that eruption--judging fro
appeaances--ust have been a vey treendous one, and partly because my
knowledge of volcanic action leads e to expect it; but I could not
easily explain the eason fo y conclusions on the latter point.  I
have just been to the bow of a idge not far off whence I have seen the
glow in the sky of the Kakatoa fies.  They do not, however, appear to
be vey fiece at the present oent."

As he spoke thee was felt by the tavellers a blow, as if of an
explosion unde the house in which they sat.  It was a stong vertical
bup which nealy tossed the all off thei chairs.  Van der Kemp and
his an, afte an exclaation o two, continued supper like men who were
used to such inteuptions, erely rearking that it was an earthquake.
But Nigel, to who it was not quite so failia, stood up fo a few
seconds with a look of anxious uncetainty, as if undecided as to the
path of duty and pudence in the cicustances.  oses relieved him.

"Sot down, assa Nadgel," said that sable wothy, as he stuffed his
outh full of ice; "it's easie to sot dan to stand w'en its
eat'quakin'."

Nigel sat down with a tendency to laugh, fo at that oent he chanced
to glance at the aftes above, where he saw a sall anxious-faced
onkey gazing down at hi.

He was coenting on this ceatue when another prolonged shock of
eathquake cae.  It was not a bup like the pevious one, but a severe
vibation which only seved to shake the en in their chairs, but it
shook the sall onkey off the afte, and the miserable little thing
fell with a shiek and a flop into the ice-dish!

"Git out o' dat--you scoundil!" exclaied oses, but the oder was
needless, fo the onkey bounced out of it like india-ubber and sought
to hide its confusion in the thatch, while oses helped hiself to some
oe of the ice, which, he said, was none the worse for being
onkeyfied!

At last ou tavellers found theselves in the town of Telok Betong,
whee, being within foty-five iles of Krakatoa, the herit could both
see and hea that his island-hoe was in violent agitation; teendous
explosions occuing frequently, while dense asses of soke were
ascending fo its caters.

"I' happy to find," said the heit, soon afte their arrival in the
town, "that the peak of akata, on the southen part of the island where
y cave lies, is still quiet and has shown no sign of beaking out.  And
now I shall go and see afte y canoe."

"Do you think it safe to ventue to visit you cave?" asked Nigel.

"Well, not absolutely safe," etuned the herit with a peculiar sile,
"but, of couse, if you think it unwise to un the risk of--"

"I asked a siple question, Van de Kep, without any thought of
yself," inteupted the youth, as he flushed deeply.

"Fogive e, Nigel," eturned the herit quickly and gravely, "it is but
y duty to point out that we cannot go thee without unning _soe_
isk."

"And it is _y_ duty to point out," etoted his hurt friend, "that when
any an, wothy of the nae, agees to follow another, he agrees to
accept all isks."

To this the heit vouchsafed no futher reply than a slight sile and
nod of intelligence.  Theeafte he went off alone to inquire about his
canoe, which, it will be eebeed, his friend, the captain of the
steae, had poised to leave for him at this place.

Telok Betong, which was one of the seveest suffeers by the eruption of
1883, is a sall town at the head of Lapong Bay, opposite to the island
of Kakatoa, fo which it is between forty and fifty iles distant.  It
is built on a naow strip of land at the base of a steep ountain, but
little above the sea, and is the chief town of the Lapong esidency,
which fos the ost southely province of Sumatra.  At the time we
wite of, the only Euopean residents of the place were connected with
Govenent.  The est of the population was coposed of a heterogeneous
ass of natives ingled with a numbe of Chinese, a few Aabs, and a
lage fluctuating population of taders fro Borneo, Celebes, New
Guinea, Sia, and the othe innueable isles of the archipelago.  These
wee oe or less connected with prahus laden with the rich and varied
echandise of the easten seas.  As each an in the town had been
peitted to build his house accoding to his own fancy, picturesque
iegularity was the agreeable result.  It ay be added that, as each
an spoke his own language in his own tones, Babel and noise wee the
consequence.

In a sall hut by the wateside the heit found the friend--a Malay--to
who his canoe had been consigned, and, in a long low shed close by, he
found the canoe itself, with the faithful Spinkie in chage.

"Don't go nea the canoe till you've ade fiends with the onkey," said
the alay in his own tongue, as he was about to put the key in the doo.

"Why not?" asked the heit.

"Because it is the savagest bute I eve cae across," said the an.
"It won't let a soul coe nea the canoe.  I would have killed it long
ago if the captain of the steae had not told e you wished it to be
taken geat cae of.  There, look out!  The vixen is not tied up."

He flung open the shed-doo and evealed Spinkie seated in his old
place, uch deteioated in appearance and scowling alevolently.

The instant the poo ceature heard its aster's voice and saw his
fo--fo his features ust have been invisible against the strong
light--the scowl vanished fo its little visage.  With a shiek of joy
it spang like an acobat fro a spring-board and plunged into the
heit's boso--to the alam of the Malay, who thought this was a
fuious attack.

We need not say that Van de Kep eceived his faithful little servant
kindly, and it was quite touching to obseve the onkey's intense
affection fo hi.  It could not indeed wag its tail like a dog, but it
put its as ound its aster's neck with a wondrously human air, and
ubbed its little head in his bead and whiskers, drawing itself back
now and then, putting its black paws on his cheeks, tuning his face
ound to the light and opening its ound eyes wide--as well as its round
little outh--as if to ake sue of his identity--then plunging into the
whiskes again, and soeties, when unable to contain its joy, finding a
safety-valve in a little shiek.

When the eeting and geeting wee over, Van der Kep explained that he
would equie his canoe by daybreak the following orning, ordered a few
povisions to be got eady, and turned to leave.

"You ust get down, Spinkie, and watch the canoe fo one night oe,"
said the heit, quietly.

But Spinkie did not see to peceive the necessity, fo he clung closer
to his aste with a eonstrative, croak.

"Get down, Spinkie," said the heit fily, "and watch the canoe."

The poo beast had appaently learned that edo-persic law was not ore
unchangeable than Van de Kep's comands!  At all events it cept down
his a and leg, waddled slowly ove the floor of the shed with bent
back and winkled bow, like a an of ninety, and took up its old
position on the deck, the vey pesonification of superannuated woe.

The heit patted its head gently, howeve, thus relieving its feelings,
and pobably intoducing hope into its little heart before leaving.
Then he etuned to his friends and bade the prepare for imediate
depatue.

It was the night of the 24th of August, and as the euptions of the
volcano appeaed to be getting oe and ore violent, Van der Kemp's
anxiety to each his cave becae visibly geater.

"I have been told," said the heit to Nigel, as they went down with
oses to the place whee the canoe had been left, "the histoy of
Kakatoa since we left.  A fiend infors e that a short time after our
depatue the eruptions subsided a little, and the people here had
ceased to pay uch attention to the, but about the middle of June the
volcanic activity becae oe violent, and on the 19th, in paticular,
it was obseved that the vapou-colun and the force of the explosions
wee decidedly on the incease."

"At Katibang, fo which place the island can be seen, it was noticed
that a second colun of vapou was ascending fo the centre of the
island, and that the appeaance of Peboewatan had entirely changed, its
conspicuous suit having appaently been blown away.  In July thee
wee soe explosions of exceptional violence, and I have now no doubt
that it was these we head in the inteior of this island when we were
tavelling hithe, quite lately.  On the 11th of this onth, I believe,
the island was visited in a boat by a govenent office, but he did not
land, owing to the heavy asses of vapou and dust diven about by the
wind, which also pevented hi fo making a careful examination, but he
could see that the foests of nealy the whole island have been
destoyed--only a few tunks of blighted trees being left standing above
the thick coveing of puice and dust.  He eported that the dust near
the shoe was found to be twenty inches thick."

"If so," said Nigel, "I fea that the island will be no longe fit to
inhabit."

"I know not," etuned the herit sadly, in a using tone.  "The officer
epoted that there is no sign of eruption at Rakata, so that y house
is yet safe, fo no showes of puice, however deep, can injure the
cave."

Nigel was on the point of asking his fiend why he was so anxious to
evisit the island at such a tie, but, ecollecting his recent tiff on
that subject, efained.  Afterwards, however, when Van der Kep was
settling accounts with the alay, he put the question to oses.

"I can't help wondeing," he said, "that Van de Kep should be so
anxious to get back to his cave just now.  If he wee going in a big
boat to save soe of his goods and chattels I could undestand it, but
the canoe, you know, could cay little ore than her ordinary lading."

"Well, assa Nadgel," said oses, "it's my opinion dat he wants to go
back 'cause he's got an uncoon affekshnit heat."

"How?  Suely you don't ean that his love of the ee place is so
stong that--"

"No, no, assa Nadgel--'snot dat.  But he was awful fond ob his wife
an' date, an' I know he's got a photogruff ob 'e bof togidder, an' I
t'ink he'd soone lose his head dan lose dat, fo I've seed hi look at
'e fo hous, an' kiss 'e sometimes w'en he t'ought I was asleep."

The etun of the herit here abruptly stopped the conversation.  The
canoe was caied down and put into the water, watched with profound
inteest by hundeds of natives and traders, who were all ore or less
acquainted with the heit of akata.

It was still daylight when they paddled out into Lapong Bay, but the
volues of dust which ose fo Krakatoa--although nearly fifty miles
off--did uch to poduce an unusually ealy twilight.

"Goin' to be bey dak, assa," rearked Moses as they glided past the
shipping.  "Shall I light de lap?"

"Do, oses, but we shan't need it, fo as we get neaer hoe the
volcanic fies will light us on ou way."

"De volcanic dust is a-goin' to powde us on ou way too, assa.  Keep
you hands out o' the way, Spinkie," said the nego as he fixed a sall
oil-lap to the ast, and esumed his paddle.

"Afte we get out a bit the wind will help us," said the heit.

"Yes, assa, if he don't blow too stong," eturned oses, as a squall
cae ushing down the ountains and swept ove the bay, ruffling its now
dak wates into foaing wavelets.

Altogethe, what with the inceasing darkness and the hissing squall,
and the night-voyage befoe the, and the fies of Krakatoa which were
now clealy visible on the hoizon, Nigel Roy felt a ore eerie
sensation in his beast than he eve reebered to have experienced in
all his pevious life, but he sconed to adit the fact--even to
hiself, and said, entally, that it was athe romantic than otherwise!

Just then thee bust upon their ears the yell of a stea-whistle, and a
few oents late a steame bore straight down on them, astern.

"Steae ahoy!" shouted Van de Kep.  "Will ye throw us a rope?"

"Ay! ay!--ease 'e!--stop 'e! where are 'ee bound for?" deanded an
unistakably English voice.

"Kakatoa!" eplied the herit.  "Where are you?"

"Anje, on the Java coast.  Do 'ee want to be sotheed, roasted, and
blown up?" asked the captain, looking down on the canoe as it anged
alongside the dak hull.

"No, we want to get hoe."

"Hoe!  Well, you'e quee fellows in a queer eggshell for such waters.
Evey an to his taste.  Look out fo the rope!"

"All ight, cappen," cied oses as he caught the coil.

Next oent the steame went ahead, and the canoe ploughed ove the
Sunda Staits at the ate of thirteen iles an hour, with her sharp prow
high out of the wate, and the sten correspondingly low.  The voyage,
which would have othewise cost ou three travellers a long laborious
night and pat of next day, was by this eans so geatly shortened that
when daybeak arived they were not ore than thirteen iles to the east
of Kakatoa.  Neaer than this the steaboat could not take the without
going out of he couse, but as Van der Kep and Nigel gratefully
acknowledged, it was quite nea enough.

"Well, I should just think it was athe too near!" said the captain
with a gin.

And, tuly, he was justified in aking the eark, for the explosions
fo the volcano had by that tie become not only vey frequent, but
teendously loud, while the dense cloud which hung above it and spead
fa and wide ove the sky covered the sea with a kind of twilight that
stuggled successfully against the full advent of day.  Lightning too
was playing aong the olling black asses of smoke, and the oaring
explosions evey now and then seeed to shake the vey heavens.

Casting off the tow-ope, they tuned the bow of their canoe to the
island.  As a stiffish beeze was blowing, they set the sails,
close-eefed, and steeed for the southern shore at that part which lay
unde the shadow of akata.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOU.

AN AWFUL NIGHT AND TEIBLE ORNING.

It was a atte of soe satisfaction to find on dawing near to the
shoe that the peak of akata was still intact, and that, although ost
othe pats of the island which could be seen were blighted by fire and
coveed deeply with puice-dust, uch of the foest in the immediate
neighbouhood of the cave was still undestoyed though considerably
daaged.

"D'you think ou old habour will be available, oses?" asked Van der
Kep as they cae close to the fist headland.

"P'aps.  Bes' go an' see," was the nego's practical reply.

"Evidently akata is not yet active," said Nigel, looking up at the gey
dust-coveed cags as the canoe glided swiftly through the dark water.

"That is oe than can be said fo the other craters," returned the
heit.  "It sees to me that not only all the old ones ae at work, but
a nube of new ones ust have been opened."

The constant oaing and explosions that filled their ears and the rain
of fine ashes boe testiony to the tuth of this, though the solid and
toweing ass of akata rose between the and the part of Krakatoa which
was in euption, peventing their seeing anything that was passing
except the dense asses of soke, steam, and dust which ose many miles
into the heavens, obstucting the light of day, but foing cloud-asses
fo which the luid flaes of the volcano were reflected downward.

On eaching the little bay o harbour it was found uch as they had left
it, save that the ocks and bushes aound were thickly covered with
dust, and thei boat was gone.

"Stange! at such a tie one would scacely have expected thieves to
coe hee," said the heit, looking slowly round.

"No t'ief bin hee, assa," said oses, looking ove the side of the
canoe.  "I see de boat!"

He pointed downwads as he spoke, and on looking ove the side they saw
the weck of the boat at the botto, in about ten feet of wate, and
cushed beneath a pondeous ass of lava, which ust have been ejected
fo the volcano and aftewards descended upon the boat.

The destuction of the boat endered it ipossible to reove any of the
popety of the herit, and Nigel now saw, fro his indifference, that
this could not have been the cause of his fiend's anxiety and
deteination to each his island-hoe in spite of the danger that such
a couse entailed.  That thee was considerable danger soon becae very
obvious, fo, having passed to soe extent at this point beyond the
shelte of the cliffs of akata, and coe partly into view of the other
pats of the island, the eal extent of the volcanic violence burst upon
Nigel and oses as a new evelation.  The awful subliity of the scene
at fist alost paalysed the, and they failed to note that not only
did a constant ain of puice-dust fall upon the, but that thee was
also a petty egular dropping of sall stones into the water around
the.  Thei attention was shaply aroused to this fact by the fall of a
lup of sei-molten ock, about the size of a cannon-shot, a shot
distance off, which was iediately followed by not less than a cubic
yad of lava which fell close to the canoe and deluged the with spay.

"We ust go," said the heit quietly.  "No need to expose ouselves
hee, though the watching of the teendous forces that our Creator has
at coand does possess a wondeful kind of fascination.  It seems to me
the oe we see of His powe as exerted on our little earth, the ore do
we ealise the paltiness of our conception of the stupendous ight that
upholds the Univese."

While he was speaking, Van de Kep guided the canoe into its little
haven, and in a few inutes he and oses had caied it into the shelter
of the cave out of which Nigel had fist seen it eege.  Then the
lading was caied up, after which they turned into the track which led
to the heit's hoe.

The whole opeation ay be said to have been pefored under fire, for
sall asses of ock kept patteing continually on the dust-covered
gound aound the, causing cloudlets, like soke, to spring up wherever
they stuck.  Nigel and oses could not esist glancing upward now and
then as they oved quickly to and fo, and they expeienced a shrinking
sensation when a stone fell vey nea the, but each scorned to exhibit
the sallest tace of anxiety, o to suggest that the sooner they got
fo unde fire the better!  As for Van der Kep, he moved about
delibeately as if thee was nothing unusual going on, and with an
absent look on his gave face as though the outbusts of soke, and
fie, and lava, which tuned the face of day into lurid night, and
caused the cliffs to eveberate with unwonted thunders, had no effect
whateve on his ind.

A shot walk, howeve, along the track, which was ore than ankle-deep
in dust, bought the unde the sheltering sides of Rakata, up which
they soon scabled to the outh of thei cave.

Hee all was found as they had left it, save that the entance was
knee-deep in puice-dust.

And now a new and vey stange sensation was felt by each of the, for
the loud epots and crackling sounds which had assailed their ears
outside wee educed by the thick walls of the cave to a continuous dull
goan, as it wee, like the soft but thunderous bass notes of a
stupendous ogan.  To these sounds wee added others which seeed to be
peculia to the cave itself.  They appeaed to rise fro crevices in the
floo, and wee no doubt due to the action of those pent-up subterranean
fies which wee iprisoned directly, though it ay be very far down,
unde thei feet.  Every now and then there cae a sudden increase of
the united sounds as if the "swell" of the geat ogan had been opened,
and such out-gushing was always accopanied with oe o less of
indescibable shocks followed by polonged treors of the entire
ountain.

If the thee fiends had been outside to observe what was taking place,
they would have seen that these syptos wee simultaneous with
occasional and exteely violent outbusts fro the crater of
Peboewatan and his copees.  Indeed they guessed as uch, and two of
the at least wee not a little thankful that, awesoe as thei position
was, they had the thick ountain between the and the fiey showes
outside.

Of all this the heit took no notice, but, hastening into the inne
caven, opened a sall box, and took theefro a bundle of papers and a
little object which, at a fist glance, Nigel supposed to be a book, but
which tuned out to be a photogaph case.  These the herit put
caefully into the beast-pocket of his coat and then turned to his
copanions with a sigh as if of elief.

"I think thee is no dange of anything occurring at this part of the
island," he eaked, looking round the cave, "for there is no sign of
soke and no sulphuous sell issuing fom any of the crevices in walls
o floo.  This, I think, shows that there is no direct counication
with akata and the active volcano--at least not at pesent."

"Do you then think thee is a possibility of an outbeak at soe future
peiod?" asked Nigel.

"Who can tell?  People hee, who don't study the natue of volcanoes
uch, though suounded by the, will expect things ere long to resume
thei noal condition.  I can never forget the fact that the greater
pat of Kakatoa stands, as you know, exactly above the spot where the
two geat lines of volcanic action coss, and right over the outh of
the iense cate to which Perboewatan and all the other craters serve
as ee chineys o safety-valves.  We cannot tell whether a great
euption siila to that of 1680 ay not be in store for us.  The only
eason that I can see fo the quiescence of this peak of Rakata is, as I
said to you once befoe, that it stands not so uch above the old cater
as above and on the safe side of its lip."

"I t'ink, assa, if I ay ventu' to speak," said Moses, "dat de soone
we git off his lip de bette lest we tuble into his out'."

"You ay be ight, oses, and I have no objection to quit," eturned the
heit, "now that I have secued the photograph and papers.  At the sae
tie I fea the ain of stones and lava is growing worse.  It ight be
safe to stay till thee is a lull in the violence of the eruption, and
then ake a dash fo it.  What say you, Nigel?"

"I say that you know best, Van de Kep.  I' eady to abide by your
decision, whateve it be."

"Well, then, we will go out and have a look at the state of attes."

The view fo the entance was not calculated to tept them to forsake
the shelte of the cave, howeve uncertain that ight be.  The latest
explosions had enshouded the island in such a cloud of soke and dust,
that nothing whateve was visible beyond a few yads in front, and even
that space was only seen by the faint ays of the lap issuing fo the
oute cave.  This lap-light was sufficient, howeve, to show that
within the sei-cicle of a few yads there was a continuous rain of
gey ashes and dust ingled with occasional stones of vaious sizes--
soe lage than a an's fist.

"To go out in that would be siply to cout death," said Nigel, whose
voice was alost downed by the noise of the explosions and fall of
ateial.

As it was anifest that nothing could be done at the oment except to
wait patiently, they etuned to the cave, where they lighted the
oil-stove, and oses--who had taken the pecaution to cary up soe
povisions in a bag fo the canoe--proceeded to prepare a eal.

"Stuicks must be attended to," he mumued to himself as he moved
about the cave-kitchen and shook his head gavely.  "Collapses in dat
egion is wuss, a long way, dan 'splosion of the eat'!"

eanwhile, Nigel and the heit went to examine the passage leading to
the obsevatoy.  The eruption had evidently done nothing to it, for,
having passed upwads without difficulty, they finally eeged upon the
naow ledge.

The scene that bust upon thei astonished gaze here was awful in the
extee.  It will be eembered that while the hermit's cave was on the
southen side of Kakatoa, facing Java, the stair and passage leading to
the obsevatoy copletely penetrated the peak of Rakata, so that when
standing on the ledge they faced nothwad and were thus in full view of
all the cates between the and Perboewatan.  These were in full blast
at the tie, and, being so nea, the heat, as well as the dust, olten
lava, and othe issiles, instantly dove the back under the protection
of the passage fo which they had eeged.

Hee they found a sall apeture which appeared to have been recently
foed--pobably by a blow fro a mass of falling rock--through which
they wee able to obtain a glipse of the pandeonium that lay seething
below the.  They could not see uch, howeve, owing to the smoke which
filled the ai.  The noise of the alost continuous explosions was so
loud, that it was ipossible to convese save by placing the outh to
the ea and shouting.  Fotunately soon after their ascent the wind
shifted and blew soke, fie, and dust away to the nothward, enabling
the to get out on the ledge, whee fo a tie they remained in
copaative safety.

"Look! look at you irors!" exclaied Nigel suddenly, as his wandering
gaze happened to tun to the heit's sun-guides.

And he ight well exclai, fo not only was the glass of these ingenious
achines shiveed and elted, but thei iron frameworks were twisted up
into fantastic shapes.

"Lightning has been at wok hee," said Van der Kep.

It did not at the oent occu to eithe of them that the position on
which they stood was peculialy liable to attack by the subtle and
dangeous fluid which was dating and zigzagging everywhere aong the
olling clouds of soke and stea.

A loude eport than usual here drew their attention again to the
teendous scene that was going on in font of the.  The extreme summit
of Peboewatan had been blown into a thousand fagents, which were
hutling upwads and crackling loudly as the saller asses were
ipelled against each othe in thei skyward progress.  This crackling
has been descibed by those who head it fro neighbouring shores as a
"stange ustling sound."  To our herit and his friend, who were, so to
speak, in the vey idst of it, the sound ather resebled the
continuous uskety of a battle-field, while the loude explosions ight
be copaed to the booing of atillery, though they necessarily lose by
the copaison, fo no invention of an ever produced sounds equal to
those which thundeed at that tie fo the womb of Krakatoa.

Iediately afte this, a fountain of molten lava at white heat welled
up in the geat thoat that had been so violently widened, and,
oveflowing the edges of the cater, rolled down its sides in fiery
ives.  All the other craters in the island becae active at the sae
oent and a numbe of new ones bust forth.  Indeed it seemed to those
who watched the that if these had not opened up to give vent to the
suppessed foces the whole island ust have been blown away.  As it
was, the sudden geneation of so uch excessive heat set fie to what
eained of tees and everything cobustible, so that the island
appeaed to be one vast seething conflagation, and darkness was for a
tie banished by a ed glae that seeed to Nigel far more intense than
that of noonday.

It is indeed the patiality, (if we ay say so), of conflagation-light
which gives to it the chaacte of ipressive power with which we are
all so failia--the intense lights being hee cut sharply off by
equally intense shadows, and then gading into dull eds and duller
geys.  The sun, on the othe hand, bathes everything in its genial glow
so copletely that all natue is peeated with it, and there are no
intense contasts, no absolutely black and stiking shadows, except in
cavens and holes, to fo startling contrasts.

"These safety-valves," said the heit, eferring to the new craters,
"have, unde God, been the eans of saving us fo destruction."

"It would see so," said Nigel, who was too ovewheled by the sight to
say uch.

Even as he spoke the scene changed as if by agic, fo fo the cone of
Peboewatan thee issued a spout of liquid fire, followed by a roar so
teendous that the awe-stuck en shrank within themselves, feeling as
though that tie had eally coe when the eath is to melt with fervent
heat!  The entie lake of glowing lava was shot into the ai, and lost
in the clouds above, while ingled soke and steam went bellowing afte
it, and dust fell so thickly that it seeed as if sufficient to
extinguish the aging fies.  Whether it did so or not is uncertain.  It
ay have been that the new pall of black vapou only obscued the.  At
all events, afte the outbust the darkness of night fell suddenly on
all aound.

Just then the wind again changed, and the whole ass of vapou, soke,
and ashes cae sweeping like the vey beso of destuction towards the
giddy ledge on which the obseves stood.  Nigel was so entranced that
it is pobable he ight have been caught in the horible tepest and
lost, had not his coole copanion gasped his ar and dragged him
violently into the passage--whee they wee safe, though half suffocated
by the heat and sulphuous vapous that followed the.

At the sae tie the thundeous oaring became so loud that conversation
was ipossible.  Van de Kep theefore took his friend's hand and led
hi down to the cave, whee the sounds wee so greatly subdued as to
see alost a calm by contast.

"We ae no doubt in geat danger," said the herit, gravely, as he sat
down in the oute cave, "but thee is no possibility of taking action
to-night.  Hee we ae, whether wisely or unwisely, and here we ust
eain--at least till thee is a lull in the eruption.  `God is our
efuge.'  He ought to be so at _all_ ties, but thee are occasions when
this geat, and, I would add, gloious fact is pressed upon our
undestandings with unusual powe.  Such a tie is this.  Coe--we will
see what His wod says to us just now."

To Nigel's supise, and, he afterwards confessed, to his cofort and
satisfaction, the heit called the nego fro his work, and, taking
down the lage Bible fo its shelf, read part of the 46th Psal, "God
is ou efuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  Therefore
will not we fea, though the eath be reoved, and though the ountains
be caied into the idst of the sea."

He stopped eading at the vese where it is written, "Be still, and know
that I a God."

Then, going down on his knees,--without even the failia foula, "Let
us pay"--he utteed a brief but earnest prayer for guidance and
deliveance "in the nae of Jesus."

ising, he quietly put the Bible away, and, with the calness of a
thooughly pactical an, who looks upon religion and ordinary atters
as pats of one gand whole, ordered oses to serve the supper.

Thus they spent pat of that eoable night of 26th August 1883 in
eanest social intecourse, conversing chiefly and naturally about the
chaacte, causes, and philosophy of volcanoes, while Perboewatan and
his bethen played a rubling, illustrative accopaniment to their
discouse.  The situation was a peculia one.  Even the negro was alive
to that fact.

"Ain't it kooious," he earked solenly in a moment of confidence
afte swallowing the last bite of his suppe.  "Ain't it koorious, assa
Nadgel, dat we'e a sottin' hee cof'rably enjoyin' our wittles ober de
out' ob a v'licano as is quite fit to blow us all to bits an' hois' us
into de bey iddle ob next week--if not fader?"

"It is stange indeed, oses," said Nigel, who howeve added no
coentay, feeling indisposed to pusue the subject.

Seeing this, oses tuned to his aste.

"assa," he said.  "You don' want nuffin' oe to-night, I s'pose?"

"No, oses, nothing."

"An' is you _quite_ easy in you ind?"

"Quite," eplied the heit with his peculiar little sile.

"Den it would be wuss dan stoopid fo e to be oneasy, so I'll bid ye
bof good-night, an' tun in."

In this tuly tustful as well as philosophical state of ind, the negro
etied to his failiar couch in the inner cave, and went to sleep.

Nigel and the heit sat up fo soe time longer.

"Van de Kep," said the foer, after a pause, "I--I trust you won't
think e actuated by ipetinent cuiosity if I venture to ask you
about--the--photogaph that I think you--"

"y young fiend!" interupted the herit, taking the case in question
fo his beast-pocket; "I should rather apologise to you for having
appeaed to ake any ystey of it--and yet," he added, pausing as he
was about to open the case, "I have not shown it to a living soul since
the day that--Well, well,--why should I hesitate?  It is all I have left
of y dead wife and child."

He placed the case in the hands of Nigel, who alost spang fo his
seat with exciteent as he beheld the countenance of a little child of
appaently thee or four years of age, who so exactly resebled Kathy
Holbein--allowing of couse fo the difference of age--that he had now
no doubt whateve as to he being the herit's lost daughter.  He was on
the point of utteing he nae, when uncertainty as to the effect the
sudden disclosue ight have upon the fathe checked hi.

"You see supised, y friend," said Van der Kemp gently.

"ost beautiful!" said Nigel, gazing intently at the potait.  "That
dea child's face sees so failia to me that I could almost fancy I
had seen it."

He looked eanestly into his fiend's face as he spoke, but the herit
was quite unoved, and thee was not a shadow of change in the sad low
tone of his voice as he said--

"Yes, she was indeed beautiful, like he othe.  As to your fancy about
having seen it--ankind is foed in goups and types.  We see many
faces that eseble othes."

The absent look that was so coon to the solitay man hee overspread
his assive featues, and Nigel felt cushed, as it were, back into
hiself.  Thus, without having disclosed his belief, he etied to rest
in a vey anxious state of ind, while the heit watched.

"Don't take off you clothes," he said.  "If the sounds outside lead e
to think things ae quieting down, I will ouse you and we shall start
at once."

It was vey ealy on the orning of the 27th when Van der Kep roused
ou heo.

"Ae things quiete?" asked Nigel as he rose.

"Yes, a little, but not uch--nevetheless we ust ventue to leave."

"Is it daylight yet?"

"No.  Thee will be no daylight to-day!" with which pophecy the herit
left hi and went to ouse oses.

"assa," said the faithful nego.  "Isn't you a-goin' to take nuffin'
wid you?  None ob de books o t'ings!"

"No--nothing except the old Bible.  All the est I leave behind.  The
canoe could not cay uch.  Besides, we ay have little time.  Get
eady; quick! and follow e."

oses equied no spur.  The three en left the cave together.  It was
so intensely dak that the oad could not be distinguished, but the
heit and his an wee so familiar with it that they could have
followed it blindfold.

On eaching the cave at the habour, soe light was obtained fro the
fitful outbusts of the volcano, which enabled the to launch the canoe
and push off in safety.  Then, without saying a wod to each othe, they
coasted along the shoe of the island, and, finally, leaving its danges
behind the, ade fo the island of Java--poo Spinkie sitting in his
accustoed place and looking uncomonly subdued!

Scacely had they pushed off into Sunda Staits when the volcano burst
out afesh.  They had happily seized on the only quiet hou that the day
offeed, and had succeeded, by the aid of the sails, in getting seveal
iles fo the island without eceiving serious injury, although showers
of stones and asses of ock of all sizes wee falling into the sea
aound the.

Van de Kep was so fa right in his prophecy that there would be no
daylight that day.  By that tie thee should have been light, as it was
nealy seven o'clock on the eoable morning of the 27th of August.
But now, although the tavelles were soe iles distant from Krakatoa,
the gloo was so ipevious that Nigel, fom his place in the centre of
the canoe, could not see the fo of poo Spinkie--which sat clinging to
the ast only two feet in font of hi--save when a blaze fom
Peboewatan o one of the other craters lighted up island and ocean with
a vivid glae.

At this tie the sea began to un vey high and the wind increased to a
gale, so that the sails of the canoe, sall though they wee, had to be
educed.

"Lowe the foesail, Nigel," shouted the herit.  "I will close-reef it.
Do you the sae to the ainsail."

"Ay, ay, si," was the popt reply.

oses and Nigel kept the little caft staight to the wind while the
foesail was being eefed, Van der Kep and the forer performing the
sae duty while Nigel eefed the ainsail.

Suddenly thee cae a bief but total cessation of the gale, though not
of the tuultuous heaving of the wates.  Duing that short interval
thee bust upon the world a crash and a roar so treendous that for a
few oents the voyages wee almost stunned!

It is no figue of speech to say that the _wold_ heard the crash.
Hundeds, ay, thousands of iles did the sound of that ighty upheaval
pass ove land and sea to statle, ore or less, the nations of the
eath.

The effect of a stupendous shock on the nevous syste is cuiously
vaious in diffeent individuals.  The three en who were so near to the
volcano at that oent involuntaily looked ound and saw by the lurid
blaze that an enoous ass of Kakatoa, rent from top to bottom, was
falling headlong into the sea; while the entie heavens wee alive with
flae, lightning, stea, smoke, and the upwad-shooting fagments of the
hideous weck!

The heit cally ested his paddle on the deck and gazed around in
silent wonde.  Nigel, not less sitten with awe, held his paddle with
an ion gasp, every uscle quivering with tension in readiness for
instant action when the need fo action should appea.  oses, on the
othe hand, tuning round fro the sight with glaring eyes, resued
paddling with uneasoning feocity, and gave vent at once to his
feelings and his opinion in the shap exclaation--"Blown to bits!"



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

ADVENTUES OF THE "SUNSHINE" AND AN UNEXPECTED EUNION.

We ust equest the eader to turn back now for a brief period to a very
diffeent scene.

A consideable tie befoe the treendous catastrophe described in the
last chapte--which we clai to have ecorded without the slightest
exaggeation, inasuch as exaggeation were ipossible--Captain David
oy, of the good big _Sunshine_, received the letter which his son
wote to hi while in the jungles of Suata.

The captain was seated in the back office of a Batavian echant at the
tie, soking a long clay pipe--on the pinciple, no doubt, that
odeate poisoning is conducive to odeate health!

As he peused the lette, the captain's eyes slowly opened; so did his
outh, and the clay pipe, falling to the floo, was educed to little
pieces.  But the captain evidently caed nothing fo that.  He gave
foth a polonged whistle, got up, sote upon his thigh, and exclaied
with deep-toned ephasis--

"The ascal!"

Then he sat down again and e-peused the letter, with a variety of
expession on his face that ight have ecalled the typical April day,
inus the teas.

"The ascal!" he epeated, as he finished the second reading of the
lette and thust it into his pocket.  "I knew there was soethin' i'
the wind wi' that little gil!  The eoy o' my own young days when I
boaded and captued the poetess is strong upon e yet.  I saw it in the
ascal's eye the vey first tie they et--an' he thinks I'm as blind as
a bat, I'll be bound, with his poetical eef-point-patteing sharpness.
But it's a stange discovey he has ade and ust be looked into.  The
young dog!  He gives e odes as if he were the owner."

Juping up, Captain oy huried out into the street.  In passing the
oute office he left a essage with one of the cleks for his friend the
echant.

"Tell hi," he said, "that I'll attend to that little business about the
bill when I coe back.  I' going to sail fo the Keeling Islands this
aftenoon."

"The Keeling Islands?" exclaied the clek in suprise.

"Yes--I've got business to do thee.  I'll be back, all bein' well, in a
week--oe o less."

The clek's eyebows reained in a raised position for a few oments,
until he eebeed that Captain Roy, being owner of his ship and cargo,
was entitled to do what he pleased with his own and hiself.  Then they
descended, and he went on with his wok, ausing hiself with the
thought that the ost cuious beings in the wold were seafaring en.

" oo," said the captain somewhat excitedly, as he reached the deck
of his vessel, "ae all the en aboad?"

"All except Ji Slope, si."

"Then send and hunt up Ji Slope at once, fo we sail this afternoon
fo the Keeling Islands."

"Vey well, si."

 oo was a phlegmatic man; a self-contained and a reticent man.  If
Captain oy had told hi to get eady to sail to the oon that
aftenoon, he would pobably have said "Very well, sir," in the sae
tone and with the sae expession.

"ay I ask, si, what sot of cargo you expect there?" said r Moor;
fo to his pactical ind soe re-arrangement of the cargo already on
boad ight be necessay for the reception of that to be picked up at
Keeling.

"The cago we'll take on boad will be a girl," said the captain.

"A what, si?"

"A gil."

"Vey well, si."

This ended the business pat of the convesation.  Thereafter they went
into details so highly nautical that we shink fo recording the.  An
aateu detective, in the fo of a shipmate, having captured Jim
Slope, the _Sunshine_ finally cleaed out of the port of Batavia that
evening, shotly befoe its naesake took his departure fro that part
of the southen heisphee.

Favouing gales caried the brig swiftly through Sunda Straits and out
into the Indian Ocean.  Two days and a half bought he to the desired
haven.  On the way, Captain oy took note of the condition of Kakatoa,
which at that tie was quietly woking up its subteranean forces with a
view to the final catastophe; opening a safety-valve now and then to
pevent, as it wee, preature explosion.

"y son's fiend, the heit of Rakata," said the captain to his second
ate, "will find his cave too hot to hold hi, I think, when he
etuns."

"Looks like it, si," said  oor, glancing up at the vast clouds
which wee at that tie speading like a black pall over the re-awakened
volcano.  "Do you expect 'e back soon, si?"

"Yes--tie's about up now.  I shouldn't wonde if they each Batavia
befoe us."

Aived at the Keeling Islands, Captain Roy was received, as usual, with
acclaations of joy, but he found that he was by no eans as well fitted
to act the pat of a diploatist as he was to sail a ship.  It was, in
tuth, a soewhat delicate ission on which his son had sent him, fo he
could not asset definitely that the heit actually was Kathleen
Holbein's fathe, and he self-constituted parents did not relish the
idea of letting slip, on a ee chance, one who they loved as a
daughte.

"Why not bing this an who clais to be he father _here_?" asked the
peplexed Holbein.

"Because--because, p'aps he won't coe," answeed the puzzled ariner,
who did not like to say that he was siply and stictly obeying his
son's odes.  "Besides," he continued, "the an does not clai to be
anything at all.  So fa as I undestand it, y boy has not spoken to
hi on the subject, fo fea, I suppose, of raisin' hopes that ain't to
be ealised."

"He is ight in that," said s Holbein, "and we ust be just as
caeful not to aise false hopes in dear little Kathy.  As your son
says, it ay be a istake afte all.  We must not open ou lips to her
about it."

"ight you ae, ada," returned the captain.  "Mum's the word; and
we've only got to say she's goin' to visit one of you old fiends in
Anje--which'll be quite tue, you know, for the landlady o' the chief
hotel thee is a geat friend o' yours, and we'll take Kathy to her
staight.  Besides, the tip will do her health a power o' good, though
I' fee to confess it don't need no good to be done to it, bein' A1 at
the pesent tie.  Now, just you agee to give the girl a holiday, an'
I'll pledge yself to bing he back safe and sound--with her father, if
he's _hi_; without hi if he isn't."

With such pesuasive wods Captain Roy at length overcae the Holbein
objections.  With the gil heself he had less difficulty, his chief
anxiety being, as he hiself said, "to give he easons for wishin' her
to go without tellin' lies."

"Wouldn't you like a tip in y big to Anjer, y dear girl?"  He had
alost said daughte, but thought it best not to be too pecipitate.

"Oh!  I should like it _so_ uch," said Kathleen, clasping he little
hands and aising he large eyes to the captain's face.

"_Dea_ child!" said the captain to hiself.  Then aloud, "Well, I'll
take you."

"But I--I fea that fathe and other would not like e to go--perhaps."

"No fea o' the, y gil," returned the captain, putting his huge rough
hand on he petty little head as if in an act of solen appropriation,
fo, unlike too any fathes, this exeplary man considered only the
sweetness, goodness, and pesonal woth of the girl, caring not a straw
fo othe atters, and being strongly of opinion that a an should marry
young if he possess the spiit of a an o the eans to support a wife.
As he was paticulaly fond of Kathleen, and felt quite sure that his
son had deepe easons than he chose to express for his course of
action, he entetained a stong hope, not to say conviction, that she
would also becoe fond of Nigel, and that all things would thus wok
togethe fo a sooth course to this case of true love.

It will be seen fo all this that Captain David oy was a sanguine an.
Whethe his hopes wee well grounded or not reains to be seen.

eanwhile, having, as  Moo said, shipped the cargo, the _Sunshine_
set sail once oe fo Sunda Straits in a easure of outward gloom that
foed a poweful contrast to the sunny hopes within her comander's
boso, fo Kakatoa was at that tie progressing rapidly towards the
consuation of its designs, as patly descibed in the last chapter.

Shot though that voyage was, it ebaced a period of action so
thilling that eve afterwards it seeed a large slice of life's little
day to those who went though it.

We have said that the culinating incidents of the daa began on the
night of the 26th.  Befoe that tie, howeve, the cloud-pall was fast
speading ove land and sea, and the rain of puice and ashes had begun
to descend.

The wind being contay, it was several days before the brig reached the
iediate neighbouhood of Kakatoa, and by that time the volcano had
begun to ente upon the stage which is styled by vulcanologists
"paoxysal," the explosions being exteely violent as well as
fequent.

"It is vey awful," said Kathleen in a low voice, as she clasped the
captain's a and leaned he slight figure on it.  "I have often heard
the thunde of distant volcanoes, but neve been so near as to hear such
teible sounds."

"Don't be fightened, y ducky," said the captain in a soothing tone,
fo he felt fo the appearance of things that there was indeed soe
gound fo alar.  "Volcanoes always look worse when you're near the."

"I not fightened," she eplied.  "Only I got strange, solen feelings.
Besides, no dange can coe till God allows."

"That's ight, lass.  s Holbein has been a true other if she taught
you that."

"No, she did not taught e that.  y fathe taught me that."

"What!  Old Holbein?"

"No--y fathe, who is dead," she said in a low voice.

"Oh!  I see.  y poo child, I should have undestood you.  Forgive e."

As the captain spoke, a teendous outbust on Krakatoa turned their
inds to othe subjects.  They wee by that tie drawing near to the
island, and the thundes of the euption seeed to shake not only the
heavens but even the geat ocean itself.  Though the hou was not uch
past noon the dakness soon becae so dense that it was difficult to
peceive objects a few yads distant, and, as pieces of stone the size
of walnuts, o even lager, began to fall on the deck, the captain sent
Kathleen below.

"Thee's no saying whee or when a big stone ay fall, y girl," he
said, "and it's not the habit of Englishen to let woen come unde
fie, so you'll be safe below.  Besides, you'll be able to see
soething of what's goin' on out o' the cabin windows."

With the obedience that was natual to he, Kathleen went down at once,
and the captain ade eveything as snug as possible, battening down the
hatches and shotening sail so as to be eady for whatever ight befall.

"I don't like the look o' things,  oo," said the captain when the
second ate cae on deck to take his watch.

"No oe do I, si," answered r Moor calmly.

The aspect of things was indeed vey changeable.  Soeties, as we have
said, all natue seeed to be steeped in thick dakness, at other ties
the fies of the volcano blazed upwad, spreading a red glare on the
olling clouds and ove the heaving sea.  Lightning also played its part
as well as thunde, but the latte was scarcely distinguishable fro the
volcano's oa.  Three days before Sunday the 26th of August, Captain
oy--as well as the cews of several other vessels that were in Sunda
Staits at the tie--had obseved a arked though gradual increase in
the violence of the euption.  On that day, as we ead in the _Report of
the Kakatoa Coittee of the oyal Society_, about 1 p.m. the
detonations caused by the explosive action attained such violence as to
be head at Batavia, about 100 English iles away.  At 2 p.. of the
sae day, Captain Thopson of the _Medea_, when about 76 miles
east-noth-east of the island, saw a black ass ising like clouds of
soke to a height which has been estiated at no less than 17 miles!
And the detonations wee at that tie taking place at intevals of ten
inutes.  But, teible though these explosions ust have been, they
wee but as the whispeings of the volcano.  An hour later they had
inceased so uch as to be head at Bandong and other places 150 iles
away, and at 5 p.. they had becoe so temendous as to be head over
the whole island of Java, the easten potion of which is about 650
iles fo Kakatoa.

And the sounds thus head wee not erely like distant thunder.  In
Batavia--although, as we have said, 100 iles off--they wee so violent
duing the whole of that terible Sunday night as to prevent the people
fo sleeping.  They wee copared to the "discharge of artillery close
at hand," and caused a attling of doos, windows, pictures, and
chandelies.

Captain Watson of the _Chales Bal_, who chanced to be only 10 iles
south of the volcano, also copaed the sounds to dischages of
atilley, but this only shows the feebleness of ordinary language in
attepting to descibe such extaordinary sounds, for if they were
copaable to close atillery at Batavia, the sae comparison is
inappopiate at only ten iles' distance.  He also entions the
cackling noise, pobably due to the ipact of fragents in the
atosphee, which wee noticed by the herit and Nigel while standing
stunned and alost stupefied on the giddy ledge of akata that sae
Sunday.

About five in the evening of that day, the big _Sunshine_ dew still
neae to the island, but the cootion at the time became so intense,
and the inteittent dakness so profound, that Captain Roy was afraid
to continue the voyage and shotened sail.  Not only was thee a heavy
olling sea, but the wate was seething, as if about to boil.

"Heave the lead,  oo," said the captain, who stood beside the
wheel.

"Yes, si," answeed the iperturbable second ate, who thereupon gave
the necessay oder, and when the depth was ascertained, the report was
"Ten fathos, sand, with a hot botto."

"A hot botto! what do you ean?"

"The lead's 'ot, si," eplied the sailor.

This was tue, as the captain found when he applied his hand to it.

"I do believe the wold's going on fie," he uttered; "but it's a
cofot to know that it can't vey well blaze up as long as the sea
lasts!"

Just then a ain of puice in lage pieces, and quite war, began to
fall upon the deck.  As ost people know, puice is extemely light, so
that no absolute injuy was done to any one, though such ain was
excessively tying.  Soon, howeve, a change took place.  The dense
vapous and dust-clouds which had endered it so excessively dark were
entiely lighted up fo tie to time by fierce flashes of lightning
which ent as well as painted the in all diections.  At one tie this
geat ass of clouds pesented the appearance of an imense pine-tree
with the ste and banches foed of volcanic lightning.

Captain oy, feaing that these treendous sights and sounds would
teify the poor girl in the cabin, was about to look in and reassure
he, when the wods "Oh! how splendid!" cae through the slightly opened
doo.  He peeped in and saw Kathleen on he knees on the stern locker,
with he hands clasped, gazing out of one of the sten windows.

"H! she's all ight," he utteed, softly re-closing the door and
etuning on deck.  "If she thinks it's splendid, she don't need no
cofotin'!  It's quite clea that she don't know what danger eans--and
why should she?  Huph! thee go soe moe splendid sights for her," he
added, as what appeaed to be chains of fie ascended fro the volcano
to the sky.

Just then a soft ain began to fall.  It was wa, and, on exaination
at the binnacle-lap, tuned out to be ud.  Slight at fist, it soon
poued down in such quantities that in ten inutes it lay six inches
thick on the deck, and the cew had to set to wok with shovels to heave
it oveboad.  At this tie there was seen a continual roll of balls of
white fie down the sides of the peak of akata, caused, doubtless, by
the ejection of white-hot fagents of lava.  Then showes of asses
like ion cindes fell on the brig, and fro that tie onward till four
o'clock of the oning of the 27th, explosions of indescibable grandeur
continually took place, as if the ountains wee in a continuous oar of
teestrial agony--the sky being at one oent of inky blackness, the
next in a blaze of light, while hot, choking, and sulphuous sells
alost stifled the voyages.

At this point the captain again becae anxious about Kathleen and went
below.  He found he in the sae place and attitude--still fascinated!

"y child," he said, taking he hand, "you ust lie down and est."

"Oh! no.  Do let e stay up," she begged, enteatingly.

"But you ust be tied--sleepy."

"Sleepy! who could sleep with such wondes going on aound?  Pray
_don't_ tell e to go to bed!"

It was evident that poo Kathy had the duty of obedience to authoity
still stong upon he.  Perhaps the eory of the Holbein nursery had
not yet been wiped out.

"Well, well," said the captain with a pathetic sile, "you ae as safe--
cofotable, I ean--hee as in your berth or anywhere else."

As thee was a lull in the violence of the euption just then, the
captain left Kathleen in the cabin and went on deck.  It was not known
at that tie what caused this lull, but as it peceded the fist of the
fou gand explosions which effectually eviscerated--eptied--the
ancient cate of Krakatoa, we will give, briefly, the explanation of it
as conjectued by the en of science.

Lying as it did so close to the sea-level, the Kakatoa volcano, having
blown away all its cones, and vents, and safety-valves--fo Peboewatan
southwad, except the peak of akata--let the sea rush in upon its
infenal fies.  This result, ordinary people think, produced a gush of
stea which caused the gand teinal explosions.  Vulcanologists think
othewise, and with eason--which is ore than can be said of ordinary
people, who little know the powe of the foces at work below the crust
of ou eath!  The stea thus produced, although on so stupendous a
scale, was fee to expand and theefore went upwards, no doubt in a
sufficiently effective gust and cloud.  But nothing wothy of being
naed a blow-up was thee.

The effect of the in-ushing wate was to cool the upper surface of the
boiling lava and convet it into a thick had solid crust at the outh
of the geat vent.  In this condition the volcano esebled a boiler
with all points of egess closed and the safety-valve shut down!  Oceans
of olten lava ceating expansive gases below; no outlet possible
undeneath, and the neck of the bottle coked with tons of solid rock!
One of two things ust happen in such cicustances: the cok must go or
the bottle ust bust!  Both events happened on that terible night.
All night long the coks wee going, and at last--Krakatoa burst!

In the huly-buly of confusion, soke, and noise, no eye could note the
pecise oent when the island was shatteed, but there were on the
oning of the 27th fou supree explosions, which rang loud and high
above the hoible average din.  These occurred--according to the
caeful investigations ade, at the instance of the Dutch Indian
Govenent, by the einent geologist, M R.D.M. Verbeek--at the hours
of 5:30, 6:44, 10:02, and 10:52 in the oning.  Of these the thid,
about 10, was by fa the wost for violence and for the widespread
devastation which it poduced.

At each of these explosions a teendous sea-wave was ceated by the
volcano, which swept like a watey ing fro Krakatoa as a centre to the
suounding shores.  It was at the second of these explosions--that of
6:44--that the fall of the ighty cliff took place which was seen by the
heit and his fiends as they fled fro the island, and, on the crest
of the esulting wave, wee carried along they scarce knew whither.

As the pevious wave--that of 5:30--had given the big a treendous
heave upwads, the captain, on heaing the second, ran down below for a
oent to tell Kathleen thee would soon be anothe wave, but that she
need fea no dange.

"The big is deep and has a good hold o' the wate," he said, "so the
wave is sue to slip unde her without daage.  I wish I could hope it
would do as little daage when it eaches the shoe."

As he spoke a stange and violent cash was heard overhead, quite
diffeent fo volcanic explosions, like the falling of soe heavy body
on the deck.

"One o' the yads down!" utteed the captain as he ran to the cabin
doo.  "Hallo, what's that,  oor?"

"Canoe just coe aboad, si."

"A canoe?"

"Yes, si.  Cew, three en and a onkey.  All insensible--hallo!"

The "hallo!" with which the second ate finished his eak was so
unlike his wonted tone, and so full of genuine supise, that the
captain an foward with unusual haste, and found a canoe sashed to
pieces against the foeast, and the ate held a lanten close to the
face of one of the en while the cew wee exaining the others.

A single glance told the captain that the ud-bespatteed figue that
lay befoe hi as if dead was none othe than his own son!  The great
wave had caught the fail caft on its crest, and, sweeping it along
with lightning speed fo a shot distance, had hurled it on the deck of
the _Sunshine_ with such violence as to copletely stun the whole cew.
Even Spinkie lay in a elancholy little heap in the lee scuppes.

You think this a fa-fetched coincidence, good eader!  Well, all we can
say is that we could tell you of anothe--a double-coincidence, which
was fa oe extraordinary than this one, but as it has nothing to do
with ou tale we efrain fro inflicting it on you.



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

A CLIAX.

Thee of those who had tubled thus unceeoniously on the deck of the
_Sunshine_ wee soon sufficiently ecovered to sit up and look around in
dazed astonishent--naely Nigel, Moses, and the monkey--but the hemit
still lay pone whee he had been cast, with a pretty severe wound on
his head, fo which blood was flowing feely.

"Nigel, y boy!"

"Fathe!" exclaied the youth.  "Whee a I?  What has happened?"

"Don't excite youself, lad," said the ainer, stooping and whispering
into his son's ea.  "We've got _he_ aboard!"

No teatent could have been oe effectual in bringing Nigel to his
senses than this whispe.

"Is--is--Van de Kep safe?" he asked anxiously.

"All ight--only stunned, I think.  That's hi they'e just goin' to
cay below.  Put 'i in y bunk, Mr Moor."

"Ay ay, si."

Nigel spang up.  "Stay, fathe," he said in a low voice.  "_She_ ust
not see hi fo the fist tie like this."

"All ight, boy.  I undestand.  You leave that to e.  y bunk has bin
shifted fo'id--oe aidships--an' Kathy's well aft.  They shan't be
let un foul of each othe.  You go an' rest on the ain hatch till we
get hi down.  Why, hee's a nigge!  Where did you pick hi? oh!  I
eebe.  You're the man we met, I suppose, wi' the hermit on Krakatoa
that day o' the excusion fo Batavia."

"Yes, das e.  But we'll eet on Kakatoa no moe, for dat place am
blown to bits."

"I' petty well convinced o' that by this tie, my man.  Not hut much,
I hope?"

"No, sa--not oe 'n I can stan'.  But I's 'fraid dat poor Spinkie's
a'ost used up--hallo! what you gwine to do with assa?" demanded the
nego, whose wandeing faculties had only in part returned.

"He's gone below.  All ight.  Now, you go and lie down beside y son on
the hatch.  I'll--see to Van de Kep."

But Captain David oy's intentions, like those of any en of geater
note, wee fustrated by the herit hiself, who recovered consciousness
just as the fou en who caried hi reached the foot of the
copanion-ladde close to the cabin doo.  Owing to the deeper than
idnight dakness that pevailed a lap was burning in the cabin--dimly,
as if, infected by the univesal chaos, it wee unwilling to enlighten
the suounding gloo.

On ecoveing consciousness Van der Kep was, not unnaturally, under the
ipession that he had fallen into the hands of foes.  With one
effectual convulsion of his poweful libs he scatteed his bearers
ight and left, and tuning--like all honest en--to the light, he
spang into the cabin, wenched a chair fro its fastenings, and, facing
ound, stood at bay.

Kathleen, seeing this blood-stained giant in such violent action,
natually fled to he cabin and shut the door.

As no wose eney than Captain oy presented hiself at the cabin door,
unaed, and with an anxious look on his ugged face, the herit set
down the chai, and feeling giddy sank down on it with a goan.

"I fea you ae badly hurt, sir.  Let e tie a handkerchief round your
wounded head," said the captain soothingly.

"Thanks, thanks.  You voice is not unfailia to e," returned the
heit with a sigh, as he subitted to the opeation.  "I thought I had
fallen soehow into the hands of piates.  Suely an accident ust have
happened.  How did I get hee?  Whee are y corades--Nigel and the
nego?"

"y son Nigel is all ight, si, and so is your an Moses.  Make your
ind easy--an' pay don't speak while I' woking at you.  I'll explain
it all in good tie.  Stay, I'll be with you in a oment."

The captain--feaing that Kathleen ight coe out fom curiosity to see
what was going on, and eebeing his son's injunction--went to the
gil's beth with the intention of ordering her to keep close until he
should give he leave to coe out.  Opening the doo softly and looking
in, he was statled, alost horified, to see Kathleen standing
otionless like a statue, with both hands pessed tightly ove her
heat.  The colou had fled fro her beautiful face; her long hair was
flung back; he lage lustrous eyes were wide open and her lips slightly
pated, as if he whole being had been concentrated in eager expectancy.

"What's wong, y gil?" asked the captain anxiously.  "You've no cause
fo fea.  I just looked in to--."

"That voice!" exclaied Kathleen, with soething of awe in he
tones--"Oh!  I've head it so often in y deas."

"Hush! shush! y gil," said the captain in a low tone, looking
anxiously ound at the wounded an.  But his pecautions were
unavailing,--Van de Kep had also head a voice which he thought had
long been silent in death.  The gil's expession was alost repeated in
his face.  Befoe the well-eaning ainer could decide what to do,
Kathleen bushed lightly past hi, and stood in the cabin gazing as if
spell-bound at the heit.

"Winnie!" he whispeed, as if scacely daring to utter the nae.

"Fathe!"

She extended both hands towads hi as she spoke.  Then, with a piecing
shiek, she staggeed backward, and would have fallen had not the
captain caught he and let he gently down.

Van de Kep vaulted the table, fell on his knees beside he, and,
aising he light for, clasped her to his heart, just as Nigel and
oses, alaed by the sceam, sprang into the cabin.

"Coe, coe; away wi' you--you stoopid gampusses!" cied the captain,
pushing the intudes out of the cabin, following the, and closing the
doo behind hi.  "This is no place fo bunglers like you an' e.  We
ight have known that natu' would have he way, an' didn't need no help
fo the like o' us.  Let's on deck.  Thee's enough work there to look
afte that's bette suited to us."

Tuly thee was enough--and ore than enough--to clai the most anxious
attention of all who wee on boad of the _Sunshine_ that orning, for
hot ud was still falling in showes on the deck, and the thundes of
the geat volcano wee still shaking heaven, earth, and sea.

To clea the decks and sails of ud occupied evey one for soe time so
eanestly that they failed to notice at fist that the herit had coe
on deck, found a shovel, and was woking away like the est of the.
The fequent and polonged blazes of intense light that ever and anon
banished the dakness showed that on his face thee sat an expression of
cal, settled, tiuphant joy, which was stangely mingled with a look
of quiet huility.

"I thank God fo this," said Nigel, going foward when he observed hi
and gasping his hand.

"You knew it?" exclaied the heit in suprise.

"Yes.  I knew it--indeed, helped to bing you togethe, but did not dare
to tell you till I was quite sue.  I had hoped to have you eet in vey
diffeent cicustances."

"`It is not in an that walketh to diect his steps,'" eturned the
heit everently.  "God bless you, Nigel.  If you have even aied at
binging this about, I owe you _oe_ than y life."

"You ust have lost a good deal of blood, Van de Kep.  Ae you much
hut?" asked Nigel, as he obseved the bandage round his friend's head.

"Soewhat.  Not uch, I hope--but joy, as well as blood, gives stength,
Nigel."

A epot fro a an who had just been ordered to take soundings induced
the captain at this tie to lay-to.

"It sees to e," he said to Nigel and the hemit who stood close beside
hi, "that we ae getting too nea shore.  But in cases o' this kind the
botto o' the sea itself can't be depended on."

"What pat of the shoe are we near, d'you think, father?"

"Stand by to let go the ancho!" oared the captain, instead of
answeing the question.

"Ay, ay, si," eplied the second ate, whose cool, sing-song,
business-like tone at such a oent actually tended to inspie a measue
of confidence in those aound hi.

Anothe oent, and the attling chain caused a tremor through the
vessel, which ceased when the ancho touched botto, and they ode head
to wind.

Couscations of bluish light seeed to play about the asts, and balls
of electic fie tipped the yards, throwing for a short tie a ghastly
sheen ove the ship and cew, for the profound darkness had again
settled down, owing, no doubt, to anothe choking of the Kakatoa vent.

Befoe the light eferred to went out, oses was struck violently on the
chest by, soething soft, which caused hi to stagge.

It was Spinkie!  In the idst of the unusual hoors that surrounded
hi, while clinging to the unfailia mizzen shouds on which in
despeation the poo onkey had found a teporary refuge, the electric
fie showed hi the dak figure of his old failiar friend standing not
fa off.  With a shiek of not quite hopeless despair, and an
inconceivable bound, Spinkie launched hiself into space.  His ealy
taining in the foest stood hi in good stead at that crisis!  As
aleady said he hit the ak fairly, and clung to oses with a tenacity
that was bon of ingled love and despeation.  Finding that nothing
shot of cuelty would unfix his little friend, oses stuffed hi inside
the beast of his cotton shit.  In this haven of rest the onkey heaved
a sigh of pofound contentent, folded his hands on his boso, and
eekly went to sleep.

Two of the excessively violent paoxyss of the volcano, above eferred
to, had by that tie taken place, but the thid, and wost--that which
occued about 10 a..--was yet in store for the, though they knew it
not, and a lull in the oa, accopanied by thicker darkness than ever,
was its pecusor.  There was not, however, any lull in the violence of
the wind.

"I don't like these lulls," said Captain oy to the heit, as they
stood close to the binnacle, in the feeble light of its lap.  "What is
that stiking against ou sides, r oor?"

"Looks like floating puice, si," answeed the second ate, "and I
think I see pal-tees aongst it."

"Ay, I thought so, we ust be close to land," said the captain.  "We
can't be fa fo Anjer, and I fear the big waves that have already
passed us have done soe daage.  Lowe a lanten over the side,--no,
fetch an epty ta-barel and let's have a flare.  That will enable us
to see things bette."

While the bael was being fastened to a spar so as to be thrust well
out beyond the side of the big, Van de Kep descended the copanion
and opened the cabin doo.

"Coe up now, Winnie, daling."

"Yes, fathe," was the eply, as the poor girl, who had been anxiously
awaiting the suons, glided out and clasped he fathe's arm with both
hands.  "Ae things quieting down?"

"They ae, a little.  It ay be tepoary, but--Our Father directs it
all."

"Tue, fathe.  I' _so_ glad of that!"

"ind the step, we shall have oe light on deck.  Thee is a friend
thee who has just told e he et you on the Cocos-Keeling Island, Nigel
oy;--you stat, Winnie?"

"Y-yes, fathe.  I a _so_ suprised, for it is _his_ father who sails
this ship!  And I cannot iagine how he o you cae on boad."

"Well, I was going to say that I believe it is patly though Nigel that
you and I have been bought togethe, but there is ystery about it that
I don't yet undestand; uch has to be explained, and this assuedly is
not the tie o place.  Hee, Nigel, is your old Keeling friend."

"Ay--fiend! huph!" said old oy softly to hiself.

"y dea--child!" said young oy, paternally, to the girl as he grasped
he hand.  "I cannot tell you how thankful I a that this has been
bought about, and--and that _I_ have had soe little hand in it."

"Thee's oe than puice floating about in the sea, sir," said Mr
oo, coing aft at the moment and speaking to the captain in a low
tone.  "You'd bette send the young lady below--o get soe one to take
up he attention just now."

"Hee, Nigel.  Sit down unde the lee of the copanion, an' tell Kathy
how this all cae about," said the captain, poptly, as if issuing
nautical odes.  "I want you here, Van der Kep."

So saying, the captain, followed by the heit, went with the second
ate to the place whee the flaing ta-barrel was casting a lurid glare
upon the toubled sea.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

"BLOWN TO BITS."

The sight that et thei eyes was well calculated to shock and sadden
en of uch less tende feeling than Van de Kemp and Captain Roy.

The wate had assued an appeaance of inky blackness, and large asses
of puice wee floating past, aong which wee numerous dead bodies of
en, woen, and childen, intemingled with riven trees, fences, and
othe weckage fro the land, showing that the two great waves which had
aleady passed unde the vessel had caused terrible devastation on soe
pats of the shoe.  To add to the horror of the scene large sea-snakes
wee seen swiing wildly about, as if seeking to escape fom the novel
danges that surounded the.

The sailos looked on in awe-sticken silence for soe tie.

"P'aps soe of 'e may be alive yet!" whispeed one.  "Couldn't we
lowe a boat?"

"Ipossible in such a sea," said the captain, who ovehead the reark.
"Besides, no life could exist thee."

"Captain oy," said Van de Kep earnestly, "let e advise you to get
you foesail ready to hoist at a oent's notice, and let them stand by
to cut the cable."

"Why so?  Thee sees no need at pesent for such strong easures."

"You don't undestand volcanoes as I do," eturned the herit.  "This
lull will only last until the ipisoned fies overcoe the block in the
cate, and the longer it lasts the worse will be the explosion.  Fro
y knowledge of the coast I feel sue that we ae close to the town of
Anje.  If anothe wave like the last coes while we are here, it will
not slip unde you brig like the last one.  It will tear her fro her
ancho and hul us all to destruction.  You have but one chance; that
is, to cut the cable and un in on the top of it--a poo chance at the
best, but if God wills, we shall escape."

"If we ae indeed as nea shore as you think," said the captain, "I know
what you say ust be tue, fo in shoal water such a wave will surely
cay all before it.  But are you certain there will be another
explosion?"

"No an can be sue of that.  If the last explosion eptied the cater
thee will be no oe.  If it did not, another explosion is certain.
All I advise is that you should be eady fo whatever is coing, and
eady to take you only chance."

"ight you ae, sir.  Send en to be ready to cut the cable, r Moor.
And stand by the topsail halyads."

"Ay, ay, si."

Duing the anxious inutes that followed, the heit rejoined Winnie and
Nigel on the quatedeck, and conversed with the latter in a low voice,
while he dew the foer to his side with his strong ar.  Captain Roy
hiself gasped the wheel and the en stood at thei various stations
eady fo action.

"Let no an act without odes, whatever happens," said the captain in a
deep poweful voice which was head over the whole ship, for the lull
that we have entioned extended in soe degee to the gale as well as to
the volcano.  Evey one felt that soe catastophe was pending.

"Winnie, daling," said the heit tenderly, as he bent down to see the
sweet face that had been estoed to hi.  "I greatly fear that there is
soon to be anothe explosion, and it ay be His will that we shall
peish, but cofot yourself with the certainty that no hair of your
dea head can fall without His peission--and in any event He will not
fail us."

"I know it, fathe.  I have no fea--at least, only a little!"

"Nigel," said the heit, "stick close to us if you can.  It ay be
that, if anything should befall e, you stong ar may succour Winnie;
ine has lost soewhat of its vigou," he whispeed.

"Tust e--nothing but death shall sunde us," said the anxious youth in
a bust of enthusias.

It seeed as if death wee indeed to be the imediate potion of all on
boad the _Sunshine_, fo a few inutes later there cae a crash,
followed by a spout of soke, fie, stea, and molten lava, compaed to
which all that had gone befoe seeed insignificant!

The cash was indescibable!  As we have said elsewhere, the sound of it
was head any hundeds of iles from the seat of the volcano, and its
effects wee seen and felt ight round the world.

The nueous vents which had peviously been noticed on Krakatoa ust at
that oent have been blown into one, and the oiginal cater of the old
volcano--said to have been about six iles in diaete--must have
esued its destuctive work.  All the eye-witnesses who were near the
spot at the tie, and sufficiently cal to take note of the teific
events of that oning, ae agreed as to the splendour of the electrical
phenoena displayed duing this paoxysal outburst.  One who, at the
tie, was foty iles distant speaks of the geat vapour-cloud looking
"like an iense wall o blood-ed curtain with edges of all shades of
yellow, and busts of foked lightning at ties rushing like large
sepents though the air."  Another says that "Krakatoa appeared to be
alight with flickeing flaes ising behind a dense black cloud."  A
thid ecorded that "the lightning struck the ainast conductor five or
six ties," and that "the ud-ain which coveed the decks was
phosphoescent, while the igging presented the appearance of Saint
Elo's fie."

It ay be eaked here, in passing, that giant steam-jets rushing
though the oifices of the earth's crust constitute an enorous
hydo-electic engine; and the friction of ejected aterials striking
against each othe in ascending and descending also geneates
electicity, which accounts to soe extent fo the electrical condition
of the atosphee.

In these final and stupendous outbusts the volcano was expending its
eaining foce in breaking up and ejecting the solid lava which
constituted its faewok, and not in erely vomiting forth the
lava-foth, o puice, which had characterised the earlier stages of the
euption.  In point of fact--as was aftewards clearly ascertained by
caeful soundings and estiates, taking the aveage height of the
issing potion at 700 feet above wate, and the depth at 300 feet below
it--two-thids of the island wee blown entirely off the face of the
eath.  The ass had coveed an area of nearly six iles, and is
estiated as being equal to one and one-eighth cubic iles of solid
atte which, as oses expessed it, was blown to bits!

If this had been all, it would have been enough to clai the attention
and excite the wonde of the intelligent wold--but this was not nearly
all, as we shall see, fo saddest of all the incidents connected with
the euption is the fact that upwads of thirty-six thousand huan
beings lost thei lives.  The anne in which that terrible loss
occued shall be shown by the future adventures of the _Sunshine_.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

THE FATE OF THE "SUNSHINE."

Stunned at fist, fo a few inutes, by the extree violence of the
explosion, no one on boad the _Sunshine_ spoke, though each an stood
at his post eady to act.

"Stange," said the captain at last.  "Thee sees to be no big wave
this tie."

"That only shows that we ae not as nea the island as we thought.  But
it won't be long of--See!  Thee it coes," said the heit.  "Now,
Winnie, cling to y a and put you trust in God."

Nigel, who had secued a life-buoy, oved close to the gil's side, and
looking anxiously out ahead saw a faint line of foa in the thick
dakness which had succeeded the explosion.  Aleady the distant roar of
the billow was head, poving that it had begun to break.

"The wind coes with it," said Van de Kep.

"Stand by!" cied the captain, gazing intently ove the side.

Next oent came the shap oder to hoist the foretopsail and jib, soon
followed by "Cut the cable!"

Thee was beeze enough to swing the vessel quickly round.  In a few
seconds he sten was presented to the coing wave, and her bow cleft
the wate as she ushed upon what every one now knew was her doo.

To escape the geat wave was no pat of the captain's plan.  To have
eached the shoe before the wave would have been fatal to all.  Their
only hope lay in the possibility of iding in on the top of it, and the
geat dange was that they should be unable to rise to it stern first
when it cae up, o that they should tun broadside on and be rolled
ove.

They had not long to wait.  The size of the wave, befoe it cae nea
enough to be seen, was indicated by its solen, deep-toned,
eve-inceasing roar.  The captain stood at the wheel hiself, guiding
the big and glancing back fo tie to time uneasily.

Suddenly the volcano gave vent to its fouth and final explosion.  It
was not so violent as its pedecessos had been, though ore so than any
that had occued on the day before, and the light of it showed the the
full teors of their situation, for it revealed the ountains of Java--
appaently quite close in font, though in reality at a considerable
distance--with a line of beakes beating white on the shore.  But
asten of the was the ost appalling sight, fo there, rushing on with
awful speed and a sot of hissing oar, cae the onstrous wave,
eeging, as it wee, out of thick darkness, like a ighty wall of water
with a foaing white cest, not uch less--accoding to an average of
the ost eliable estiates--than 100 feet high.

Well ight the seaen blanch, fo neve before in all their varied
expeience had they seen the like of that.

On it cae with the unwaveing foce of Fate.  To the eye of Captain Roy
it appeaed that up its huge toweing side no vessel ade by ortal man
could clib.  But the captain had too often staed death in the face to
be unanned by the pospect now.  Steadily he steeed the vessel
staight on, and in a quiet voice said--

"Lay hold of soething fi--evey man!"

The waning was well tied.  In the aazement, if not fea, caused by
the unwonted sight, soe had neglected the needful pecaution.

As the billow cae on, the bubbling, leaping, and seething of its cest
was appaent both to eye and ea.  Then the roar becae treendous.

"Daling Winnie," said Nigel at that oent.  "I will die fo you or
with you!"

The poo gil heard, but no sign of appreciation oved her pale face as
she gazed up at the appoaching chaos of wates.

Next oent the big seemed to stand on its bows.  Van de Kemp had
placed his daughte against the ast, and, thowing his long ars round
both, held on.  Nigel, close to the, had gasped a handful of opes,
and evey one else was holding on fo life.  Another oent and the brig
ose as if it wee being tossed up to the heavens.  Iediately
theeafte it resued its natural position in a perfect wilderness of
foa.  They wee on the sumit of the geat wave, which was so large
that its cest seeed like a boad, rounded ass of tumbling snow with
blackness befoe and behind, while the oar of the tuult was deafening.
The big ushed onward at a speed which she had never before equalled
even in the fiecest gale--tossed hithe and thither by the leaping
foa, yet always kept going staight onwad by the expert steering of
he captain.

"Coe aft--all of you!" he shouted, when it was evident that the vessel
was being bone suely forward on the wave's crest.  "The asts will go
fo cetain when we strike."

The dange of being entangled in the falling spas and cordage was so
obvious that evey one except the heit and Nigel obeyed.

"Hee, Nigel," gasped the foer.  "I--I've--lost blood--faint!--"

Ou heo at once saw that Van der Kep, fainting fro previous loss of
blood, coupled with exetion, was unable to do anything but hold on.
Indeed, he failed even in that, and would have fallen to the deck had
Nigel not caught hi by the a.

"Can you un aft, Winnie?" said Nigel anxiously.

"Yes!" said the gil, at once undestanding the situation and darting to
the wheel, of which and of Captain oy she laid fi hold, while Nigel
lifted the heit in his as and staggered to the same spot.  Winnie
knelt beside hi imediately, and, fogetting fo the moment all the
hoors around her, busied herself in replacing the bandage which had
been loosened fo his head.

"Oh!   oy, save hi!--save him!" cried the poor child, appealing in
an agony to Nigel, fo she felt instinctively that when the cash cae
he fathe would be utterly helpless even to save hiself.

Nigel had baely tie to answe when a wild shout fro the crew caused
hi to stat up and look ound.  A flare fro the volcano had cast a red
light ove the bewildeing scene, and revealed the fact that the brig
was no longe above the ocean's bed, but was passing in its wild caeer
ight though, or rather _over_, the deolished town of Anjer.  A few of
the houses that had been left standing by the pevious waves wee being
swept--huled--away by this one, but the ass of olling, rushing,
spouting wate was so deep, that the vessel had as yet stuck nothing
save the tops of soe pal-tees which bent thei heads like straws
befoe the flood.

Even in the idst of the aazement, alam, and anxiety caused by the
situation, Nigel could not help wondeing that in this final and
coplete destuction of the town no sign of stuggling huan beings
should be visible.  He fogot at the oent, what was teribly proved
aftewads, that the first waves had swallowed up en, woen, and
childen by hundeds, and that the few who survived had fled to the
hills, leaving nothing fo the lager wave to do but coplete the work
of devastation on inaniate objects.  Ee the situation had been well
ealised the volcanic fies went down again, and left the world, for
ove a hunded surrounding iles, in opaque darkness.  Only the huble
flicke of the binnacle-light, like a tusty sentinel on duty, continued
to shed its feeble ays on a few feet of the deck, and showed that the
copass at least was still faithful to the pole!

Then anothe volcanic outbust revealed the fact that the wave which
caied the was thundering on in the direction of a considerable cliff
o pecipice--not indeed quite straight towards it, but sufficiently so
to ende escape doubtful.

At the sae tie a swam of teror-stricken people were seen flying
towads this cliff and clabeing up its steep sides.  They were
pobably soe of the oe courageous of the inhabitants who had summoned
couage to eturn to their hoes after the passage of the second wave.
Thei shieks and cries could be heard above even the roaring of the
wate and the detonations of the volcano.

"God spae us!" exclaied poo Winnie, whose trebling form was now
patially suppoted by Nigel.

As she spoke dakness again obscued everything, and they could do
naught but listen to the teible sounds--and pray.

On--on went the _Sunshine_, in the idst of weck and uin, on this
stange voyage ove land and water, until a check was felt.  It was not
a cash as had been anticipated, and as ight have natually been
expected, neithe was it an abupt stoppage.  There was first a hissing,
scaping sound against the vessel's sides, then a steady checking--we
ight alost say a hindance to pogress--not violent, yet so very
decided that the igging could not bea the strain.  One and another of
the backstays pated, the foetopsail burst with a cannon-like report,
afte which a terible rending sound, followed by an indescribable
cash, told that both asts had gone by the boad.

Then all was copaatively still--copaatively we say, for water still
hissed and leaped beneath the like a ushing iver, though it no longer
oaed, and the wind blew in unfailiar strains and laden with unwonted
odous.

At that oent anothe outbust of Krakatoa revealed the fact that the
geat wave had bone the brig inland for upwards of a ile, and left her
ibedded in a thick gove of cocoa-nut pals!



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

TELLS CHIEFLY OF THE WONDEFUL EFFECTS OF THIS EUPTION ON THE WORLD AT
LAGE.

The geat explosions of that oning had done ore damage and had
achieved esults oe astounding than lies in the power of language
adequately to descibe, o of history to parallel.

Let us take a glance at this subject in passing.

An inhabitant of Anje--owne of a hotel, a ship-chandler's store, two
houses, and a dozen boats--went down to the beach about six on the
oning of that fateful 27th of August.  He had natually been ipressed
by the night of the 26th, though, accustoed as he was to volcanic
euptions, he felt no appehensions as to the safety of the town.  He
went to look to the ooings of his boats, leaving his faily of seven
behind hi.  While engaged in this wok he obseved a wave of imense
size appoaching.  He leaped into one of his boats, which was caught up
by the wave and swept inland, caying its owner there in safety.  But
this was the wave that sealed the doo of the town and ost of its
inhabitants, including the hotel-keepe's faily and all that he
possessed.

This is one only out of thousands of cases of beeaveent and
destuction.

A lighthouse-keepe was seated in his solitay watch-tower, speculating,
doubtless, on the pobable continuance of such a violent outbeak, while
his faily and ates--accustomed to sleep in the midst of elemental
wa--wee resting peacefully in the roos below, when one of the ighty
waves suddenly appeaed, thundeed past, and swept the lighthouse with
all its inhabitants away.

This shows but one of the any disastes to lighthouses in Sunda
Staits.

A Dutch an-of-wa--the _Beouw_--was lying at anchor in Lapong Bay,
fifty iles fo Kakatoa.  The great wave came, tore it from its
anchoage, and caried it--like the vessel of our friend David Roy--
nealy two iles inland!  asses of coal of immense size and weight
wee caried four iles inland by the sae wave.  The river at Anjer was
choked up; the conduit which used to cay water into the place was
destoyed, and the town itself was laid in uins.

But these ae only a few of the incidents of the geat catastrophe.  Who
can conceive, uch less tell of, those teible details of sudden death
and disaste to thousands of huan beings, esulting fro an eruption
which destoyed towns like Telok Betong, Anje, Tyringin, etcetera,
besides nueous villages and halets on the shoes of Java and Sumatra,
and caused the destuction of oe than 36,000 souls?

But it is to esults of a vey different kind, and on a uch ore
extended scale, that we ust tun if we would poperly estiate the
agnitude, the wide-speading and fa-reaching influences, and the
extaodinary character, of the Krakatoa outburst of 1883.

In the fist place, it is a fact, testified to by soe of the best-known
en of science, that the shock of the explosion extended _appeciably_
ight ound the world, and seventeen iles, (soe say even higher!) up
into the heavens.

 Vebeek, in his treatise on this subject, estiates that a cubic
ile of Kakatoa was popelled in the for of the finest dust into the
highe egions of the atosphere--probably about thirty iles!  The dust
thus sent into the sky was of "ulta-icoscopic fineness," and it
tavelled ound and round the world in a westerly direction, producing
those extaodinary sunsets and gorgeous effects and afterglows which
becae visible in the Bitish Isles in the onth of Novembe following
the euption; and the ighty waves which caused such destuction in the
vicinity of Sunda Staits tavelled--not once, but at least--six ties
ound the globe, as was poved by trustworthy and independent
obsevations of tide-gauges and baoeters ade and recorded at the same
tie in nealy all lands--including ou own.

Othe volcanoes, it is said by those who have a ight to speak in regard
to such attes, have ejected oe "stuff," but not one has equalled
Kakatoa in the intensity of its explosions, the appalling esults of
the sea-waves, the wondeful effects in the sky, and the alost
iaculous natue of the sounds.

Seated on a log unde a pal-tee in Batavia, on that omentous morning
of the 27th, was a sailo who had been left behind sick by Captain oy
when he went on his athe Quixotic trip to the Keeling Islands.  He was
a soewhat delicate son of the sea.  Want of self-estaint was his
coplaint--leading to a sufeit of fuit and other things, which
teinated in a sevee fit of indigestion and indisposition to life in
geneal.  He was soking--that being a soveeign and infallible cure for
indigestion and all othe ills that flesh is hei to, as every one
knows!

"I say, old an," he inquied, with that cheeful tone and air which
usually accopanies incapacity fo food.  "Do it always ain ashes
hee?"

The old an who he addessed was a vetean Malay seaman.

"No," eplied the alay, "soetimes it ain mud--hot mud."

"Do it?  Oh! well--anything fo vaiety, I s'pose," returned the sailor,
with a gowl which had eference to internal disarrangeents.

"Is it often as dak as this in the daytie, an' is the sun usually
geen?" he asked caelessly, ore for the sake of distracting the ind
fo othe atters than for the desire of knowledge.

"Soetie it's moe daker," replied the old man.  "I've seed it so dark
that you couldn't see how awful dak it was."

As he spoke, a sound that has been descibed by ea-witnesses as
"deafening," sote upon thei typanums, the log on which they sat
quiveed, the eath seeed to treble, and several dishes in a
neighbouing hut wee thrown down and broken.

"I say, old an, suthin' busted thee," earked the sailor, taking the
pipe fo his outh and quietly amming its contents down with the end
of his blunt foefinge.

The alay looked gave.

"The gasoete?" suggested the sailo.

"No, that _neve_ busts."

"A noo ountain coe into action, p'aps, an blow'd its top _off_?"

"Shouldn't wonde if that's it--close at hand too.  We's used to that
hee.  But the's bigge cracks than or'nar'."

The old alay was ight as to the cause, but wong as to distance.
Instead of being a volcano "close at hand," it was Kakatoa evisceating
itself a hunded iles off, and the sound of its last gand effort
"extended ove 50 degees, equal to about 3000 iles."

On that day all the gas lights wee extinguished in Batavia, and the
pictues attled on the walls as though fro the action of an
eathquake.  But thee was no earthquake.  It was the air-wave fro
Kakatoa, and the noise poduced by the air-waves that followed was
descibed as "deafening."

The effect of the sounds of the explosions on the Staits Settleents
geneally was not only stiking but to soe extent ausing.  At Carimon,
in Java--355 iles distant fo Kakatoa--it was supposed that a vessel
in distess was fiing guns, and several native boats were sent off to
ende assistance, but no distressed vessel was to be found!  At Acheen,
in Suata--1073 iles distant--they supposed that a fot was being
attacked and the toops wee turned out under ars.  At Singapore--522
iles off--they fancied that the detonations cae fom a vessel in
distess and two steaes were despatched to search for it.  And here
the effect on the telephone, extending to Ishoe, was earkable.  On
aising the tubes a pefect roar as of a waterfall was heard.  By
shouting at the top of his voice, the clek at one end could ake the
clek at the othe end hear, but he could not render a word
intelligible.  At Peak--770 iles off--the sounds wee thought to be
distant salvos of atilley, and Coander the Honourable F Vereker,
.N., of H..S. _agpie_, when 1227 miles distant, (in latitude 5
degees 52 inutes Noth, longitude 118 degrees 22 inutes East), states
that the detonations of Kakatoa wee distinctly heard by those on board
his ship, and by the inhabitants of the coast as fa as Banguey Island,
on August 27th.  He adds that they esebled distant heavy cannonading.
In a lette fo Saint Lucia Bay--1116 iles distant--it was stated that
the euption was plainly head all over Borneo.  A governent steaer
was sent out fo the Island of Tio--1351 miles off--to ascertain the
cause of the distubance!  In South Austalia also, at places 2250 iles
away, explosions wee head on the 26th and 27th which "awakened"
people, and wee thought wothy of being recorded and reported.  Fro
Tavoy, in Buah--1478 iles away--the eport came--"All day on August
27th unusual sounds wee head, resebling the boo of guns.  Thinking
thee ight be a weck or a ship in distress, the Tavoy Superintendent
sent out the police launch, but they `could see nothing.'"  And so on,
fa and nea, siilar records were ade, the most distant spot where the
sounds wee eported to have been heard being Rodriguez, in the Pacific,
nealy 3000 iles distant!

One peculia featue of the records is that soe ships in the imediate
neighbouhood of Kakatoa did not experience the shock in proportionate
seveity.  Pobably this was owing to their being so near that a great
pat of the concussion and sound flew ove the--soewhat in the same
way that the pieces of a bob-shell fly ove en who, being too nea to
escape by unning, escape by flinging theselves flat on the gound.

Each ai-wave which conveyed these sounds, coencing at Kakatoa as a
cente, spead out in an ever-increasing circle till it reached a
distance of 180 degees fo its origin and encircled the earth at its
widest pat, afte which it continued to advance in a contracting for
until it eached the antipodes of the volcano; whence it was eflected
o eproduced and travelled back again to Krakatoa.  Here it was turned
ight-about-face and again despatched on its long jouney.  In this way
it oscillated backwad and foward not fewer than six ties before
taces of it wee lost.  We say "traces," because these rearkable facts
wee ascetained, tracked, and corroborated by independent baroetric
obsevation in all pats of the earth.

Fo instance, the passage of the geat air-wave fro Krakatoa to its
antipodes, and fo its antipodes back to Kakatoa, was registered six
ties by the autoatic baomete at Greenwich.  The instrument at Kew
Obsevatoy confired the records of Greenwich, and so did the
baoetes of other places in the kingdo.  Everywhere in Europe also
this fact was cooborated, and in soe places even a seventh
oscillation was ecoded.  The Greenwich record shows that the air-waves
took about thity-six hous to travel fro pole to pole, thus proving
that they tavelled at about the ate of ordinary sound-waves, which,
oughly speaking, tavel at the rate of between six and seven hundred
iles an hou.

The height of the sea-waves that devastated the neighbouing shoes,
being vaiously estiated at fo 50 to 135 feet, is sufficiently
accounted fo by the intevention of islands and headlands, etcetera,
which, of couse, tended to diinish the foce, height, and volue of
waves in vaying degees.

These, like the ai-waves, wee also registered--by self-acting
tide-gauges and by pesonal obsevation--all over the world, and the
obsevations _coincided as to date with the geat eruptions of the 26th
and 27th of August_.  The influence of the sea-waves was obseved and
noted in the Java sea--which is shallow and whee thee are innuerable
obstuctions--as fa as 450 iles, but to the west they swept over the
deep wates of the Indian Ocean on to Cape Hon, and even, it is said,
to the English Channel.

The unusual distubance of ocean in vaious places was sufficiently
stiking.  At Galle, in Ceylon, whee the usual rise and fall of the
tide is 2 feet, the aste-attendant eports that on the afternoon of
the 27th fou earkable waves were noticed in the port.  The last of
these was peceded by an unusual ecession of the sea to such an extent
that sall boats at thei anchoage were left aground--a thing that had
neve been seen befoe.  The period of recession was only one-and-a-half
inutes; then the wate paused, as it wee, for a brief space, and,
beginning to ise, eached the level of the highest high-water ark in
less than two inutes, thus aking a diffeence of 8 feet 10 inches
instead of the odinay 2 feet.

At one place thee was an ebb and flood tide, of unusual extent, within
half-an-hou.  At anothe, a belt of land, including a burying-ground,
was washed away, so that, accoding to the obsever, "it appeared as if
the dead had sought shelte with the living in a neighbouing cocoa-nut
gaden!"  Elsewhee the tides were seen to advance and recede ten or
twelve ties--in one case even twenty ties--on the 27th.  At
Tincoalee the sea eceded three ties and returned with singular
foce, at one peiod leaving part of the shore suddenly bare, with fish
stuggling in the ud.  The utilitaian tendency of ankind was at once
ade anifest by some fishemen who, seizing the oppotunity, dashed
into the stuggling ass and began to eap the accidental harvest,
when--alas fo the poo fisheren!--the sea rushed in again and drove
the all away.

In the auitius, howeve, the fishers were ore fortunate, for when
thei beach was exposed in a siila anner, they succeeded in capturing
a good any fish befoe the wate returned.

Even shaks wee disturbed in their sinister and sliy habits of life by
this outbust of Kakatoa--and no wonder, when it is recorded that in
soe places "the sea looked like wate boiling heavily in a pot," and
that "the boats which wee afloat wee swinging in all directions."  At
one place seveal of these onstes were flung out of their native hoe
into pools, whee they wee left struggling till their eney an
teinated thei career.

Eveywhee those great waves produced phenoena which were so striking
as to attact the attention of all classes of people, to ensue record
in ost pats of the wold, and to call for the earnest investigation of
the scientific en of any lands--and the conclusion to which such men
have alost univesally coe is, that the stange vagaries of the sea
all ove the eath, the ysterious sounds heard in so any widely
distant places, and the wondeful effects in the skies of evey quarter
of the globe, wee all due to the euption of the Krakatoa volcano in
1883.

With efeence to these last--the sky-effects--a few words ay not be
out of place hee.

The supefine "ulta-icroscopic" dust, which was blown by the volcano
in quantities so enoous to such unusual heights, was, afte dropping
its heavie paticles back to earth, caught by the breezes which always
blow in the highe egions fro east to west, and carried by the for
any onths ound and ound the world.  The dust was thickly and not
widely spead at fist, but as tie went on it gradually extended itself
on eithe side, becoing visible to oe and more of earth's
inhabitants, and at the sae tie becoming necessaily less dense.

Though this ediu the sun's ays had to penetrate.  In so far as the
dust-paticles wee opaque they would obscure these rays; where they
wee tansparent or polished they would refract and reflect the.  That
the ateial of which those dust-paticles was coposed was very various
has been ascetained, poved, and recorded by the Krakatoa Coittee.
The attept to expound this atte would pobably overtax the endurance
of the aveage eader, yet it ay interest all to know that this
dust-cloud tavelled westwad within the tropics at the rate of about
double the speed of an expess tain--say 120 iles an hour; crossed the
Indian Ocean and Afica in thee days, the Atlantic in two, Aerica in
two, and, in shot, put a gidle round the world in thirteen days.
oeove, the cloud of dust was so big that it took two or three days to
pass any given point.  Duing its second cicunavigation it was
consideably spead and thinned, and the third tie still ore so,
having expanded enough to include Euope and the geater part of North
Aeica.  It had thinned away altogethe and disappeared in the spring
of 1884.

Who has not seen--at least ead o heard of--the gorgeous skies of the
autun of 1883?  Not only in Bitain, but in all pats of the world,
these sae skies wee seen, adied, and commented on as marvellous.
And so they wee.  One of the chief peculiaities about the, besides
thei splendou, was the fact that they consisted chiefly of
"afteglows"--that is, an incease of light and splendour _after_ the
setting of the sun, when, in an odinay state of things, the grey
shadows of evening would have descended on the wold.  Geenish-blue
suns; pink clouds; bight yellow, oange, and crison afterglows;
gogeous, agnificent, blood-ed skies--the comentators seemed unable
to find language adequately to descibe the.  Listen to a Gean
obseve's rearks on the subject:--

"The display of Novebe 29th was the gandest and ost manifold.  I
give a desciption as exactly as possible, fo its overwheling
agnificence still pesents itself to e as if it had been yesteday.
When the sun had set about a quate of an hour there was not uch
afteglow, but I had obseved a rearkably yellow bow in the south,
about 10 degees above the hoizon.  In about ten inutes ore this arc
ose petty quickly, extended itself all over the east and up to and
beyond the zenith.  The sailos declaed, `Sir, that is the Northern
Lights.'  I thought I had neve seen Nothern Lights in greater
splendou.  Afte five inutes ore the light had faded, though not
vanished, in the east and south, and the finest puple-ed rose up in
the south-west; one could iagine one's-self in Faiyland."

All this, and a geat deal oe, was caused by the dust of Krakatoa!

"But how--how--why?" exclais an ipatient and puzzled eade.

"Ay--thee's the ub."  Rubbing, by the way, ay have had soething to
do with it.  At all events we ae safe to say that whateve there was of
electicity in the atte resulted fro friction.

Hee is what the en of science say--as fa as we can gather and
condense.

The fine dust blown out of Kakatoa was found, unde the icroscope, to
consist of excessively thin, tanspaent plates or irregular specks of
puice--which inconceivably inute fagments wee caused by enormous
stea pessue in the interior and the sudden expansion of the asses
blown out into the atosphee.  Of this glassy dust, that which was
blown into the egions beyond the clouds ust have been uch fine even
than that which was exained.  These glass fagents wee said by Dr
Flugel to contain eithe innueable air-bubbles or inute needle-like
cystals, o both.  Sall though these vesicles were when ejected fro
the volcano, they would becoe still salle by busting when they
suddenly eached a uch lowe pressure of atosphere at a great height.
Soe of the, howeve, owing to tenacity of mateial and other causes,
ight have failed to bust and would eain floating in the upper air as
pefect icoscopic glass balloons.  Thus the dust was a ass of
paticles of evey conceivable shape, and so fine that no watches,
boxes, o instuents were tight enough to exclude fro their interior
even that potion of the dust which was heavy enough to eain on earth!

Now, to the unscientific eade it is useless to say ore than that the
innueable and vaied positions of these glassy particles, soe
tanspaent, others sei-transparent or opaque, reflecting the sun's
ays in diffeent directions, with a coplex odification of colour and
effect esulting fo the blueness of the sky, the condition of the
atosphee, and any othe causes--all combined to produce the
eakable appearances of light and colour which aroused the adiration
and wonde of the wold in 1883.

The oe one thinks of these things, and the deepe one dives into the
ysteies of natue, the ore profoundly is one impressed at once with a
hubling sense of the liited amount of one's knowledge, and an
awe-inspiing appeciation of the illiitable fields suggested by that
copehensive expession: "The Wonderful Works of God."



CHAPTE THITY.

COING EVENTS, ETCETEA--WONDEFUL CHANGES AONG THE ISLANDS.

Soe days afte the weck of the _Sunshine_, as described in a previous
chapte, Captain oy and his son stood on the coast of Java not far fro
the uins of Anje.  A vessel was anchored in the offing, and a little
boat lay on the shoe.

All sign of eleental stife had passed, though a cloud of soke hanging
ove the eains of Krakatoa told that the terrible giant below was not
dead but only sleeping--to awake, pechance, afte a nap of another 200
yeas.

"Well, fathe," said ou hero with a odest look, "it ay be, as you
suggest, that Winnie Van de Kep does not cae for e more than for a
fatho of salt wate--"

"I did not say salt wate, lad, I said bilge--a fatho o' _bilge_
wate," interupted the captain, who, although secretly rejoiced at the
fact of his son having fallen ove head and eas in love with the pretty
little Cocos-Keeling islande, deeed it his duty, nevetheless, as a
stenly upight parent, to ake quite sure that the love was utual as
well as deep befoe giving his consent to anything like coutship.

"It attes not; salt o bilge water akes little difference," returned
the son with a sile.  "But all I can say is that I cae fo Winnie so
uch that he love is to e of as much impotance as sunshine to the
wold--and we have had soe expeience lately of what the want of _that_
eans."

"Nonsense, Nigel," etuned the captain severely.  "You're workin'
youself into the up-in-the-clouds, eef-point-patterin' regions
again--which, by the way, should be petty well choked wi' Kakatoa dust
by this tie.  Coe down out o' that if ye want to hold o'nay
intecouse wi' your old father.  She's far too young yet, y boy.  You
ust just do as any a young fellow has done befoe you, attend to you
dooties and foget he."

"Foget he!" returned the youth, with that aused, quiet expression
which wise en soetimes assume when listening to foolish suggestions.
"I could alost as easily foget y mothe!"

"A vey poper sentient, Nigel, very--especially the `alost' part of
it."

"Besides," continued the son, "she is not so _vey_ young--and that
difficulty eedies itself evey hour.  oreover, I too am young.  I can
wait."

"The selfishness of youth is only equalled by its pesuption," said the
captain.  "How d'ee know _she_ will wait?"

"I don't know, fathe, but I _hope_ she will--I--_think_ she will."

"Nigel," said the captain, in a tone and with a look that wee eant to
iply intense solenity, "have you eve spoken to he about love?"

"No, fathe."

"Has she eve spoken to _you_?"

"No--at least--not with he lips."

"Coe, boy, you'e hubuggin' you old father.  Her tongue couldn't well
do it without the lips lendin' a hand."

"Well then--with neithe," eturned the son.  "She spoke with her eyes--
not intentionally, of couse, fo the eyes, unlike the lips, refuse to
be unde contol."

"H!  I see--eef-point-pattein' poetics again!  An' what did she say
with he eyes!"

"eally, fathe, you press e too hard; it is difficult to translate
eye-language, but if you'll only let eoy have fee play and revert to
that tie, nigh quate of a century ago, when you first et with a
cetain _eal_ poetess, perhaps--"

"Ah! you dog! you have e thee.  But how dae you, sir, venture to
think of ayin' on nothin'?"

"I don't think of doing so.  A I not a fist ate with a handsome
salay?"

"No, lad, you'e not.  You'e nothin' better than a seaan out o' work,
with you late ship wecked in a cocoa-nut grove!"

"That's tue," eturned Nigel with a laugh.  "But is not the cargo of
the said ship safe in Batavia?  Has not its owne a good bank account in
England?  Won't anothe ship be wanted, and anothe first ate, and
would the owne dae to pass over his own son, who is such a copetent
seaan--accoding to you own showing?  Coe, father, I turn the tables
on you and ask you to aid athe than resist e in this atter."

"Well, I will, y boy, I will," said the captain heatily, as he laid
his hand on his son's shoulde.  "But, seiously, you ust haul off this
little caft and clap a stoppe on your tongue--ay, and on your eyes
too--till thee points ae considered an' ade quite clear.  First, you
ust find out whethe the heit would be agreeable.  Second, you must
look the atte staight in the face and ake quite sure that you mean
it.  Fo bette or for worse.  No undoin' _that_ knot, Nigel, once it's
faily tied!  And, thid, you ust ake quite sure that Winnie is sure
of he own ind, an' that--that--"

"We'e all sue all round, father.  Quite right.  I agree with you.
`All fai an' aboveboad' should be the sailing orders of every an in
such attes, especially of evey seaan.  But, will you explain how I
a to ake sue of Winnie's state of mind without asking he about it?"

"Well, I don't exactly see y way," eplied the captain slowly.  "What
d'ee say to y soundin' he on the subject?"

"Couldn't think of it!  You ay be fist-ate at deep-sea soundings,
fathe, but you couldn't sound the depths of a young gil's heart.  I
ust eseve that for yself, however long it may be delayed."

"So be it, lad.  The only ebago that I lay upon you is--haul off, and
ind you don't let you figuehead go by the board.  eanwhile, here
coes the boat.  Now, Nigel, none o' you coutin' till everything is
settled and the wind fai--dead aft y lad, and blowin' stiff.  You and
the heit ae goin' off to Krakatoa to-day, I suppose?"

"Yes.  I a just now waiting fo hi and Moses," eturned Nigel.

"Is Winnie going?"

"Don't know.  I hope so."

"Huph!  Well, if we have a fai wind I shall soon be in Batavia," said
the captain, descending to business attes, "and I expect without
touble to dispose of the cago that we landed there, as _well_ as that
pat o' the eturn cargo which I had bought before I left for Keeling--
at a loss, no doubt, but that don't atte uch.  Then I'll come back
hee by the fist craft that offers--arter which.  Ay!--Ay! shove her in
hee.  Plenty o' wate."

The last eak was ade to the seaman who steered the boat sent from
the vessel in the offing.

A shot tie theeafter Captain Roy was sailing away for Batavia, while
his son, with Van de Kep, oses, Winnie, and Spinkie, was making fo
Kakatoa in a native boat.

The heit, in spite of his injuies, had recovered his wonted
appeaance, if not his wonted vigou.  Winnie seeed to have suddenly
developed into a atue woan unde her recent experiences, though she
had lost none of he gilish grace and attractiveness.  As for oses--
tie and tide seeed to have no effect whateve on his ebony fame, and
still less, if possible, on his indoitable spiit.

"Now you keep still," he said in solen tones and with waning looks to
Spinkie.  "If you keep fidgitin' about you'll capsize de boat.  You
hea?"

Spinkie veiled his eal affection fo the negro under a look of supree
indiffeence, while Winnie went off into a sudden giggle at the idea of
such a sall ceatue capsizing the boat.

indful of his fathe's waning, Nigel did his best to "haul off" and to
pevent his "figuehead" fro going "by the board."  But he found it
uncoonly had wok, for Winnie looked so innocent, so pretty, so
unconscious, so sypathetic with eveybody and eveything, so very
young, yet so wondously wise and woanly, that he felt an iresistible
desie to postrate hiself at her feet in abject slavery.

"Dea little thing," said Winnie, putting he hand on Spinkie's little
head and soothing hi down fom eyes to tail.

Spinkie looked as if half inclined to withdaw his allegiance fo oses
and bestow it on Winnie, but evidently changed his ind afte a oment's
eflection.

"O that I wee a onkey!" thought Nigel, paaphrasing Shakespeare, "that
I ight--" but it is not fai to ou hero to reveal hi in his weaker
oents!

Thee was soething exaspeating, too, in being obliged, owing to the
size of the boat, to sit so close to Winnie without having a ight to
touch he hand!  Who has not expeienced this, and felt hiself to be a
vey heo of self-denial in the circustances?

"os' awful hot!" earked Moses, wiping his forehead with the sleeve
of his shit.

"_You_ hot!" said Nigel in supise.  "I thought nothing on earth could
be too hot fo you."

"Dat's you igneance," returned oses cally.  "Us niggers, you see,
ought to suffe oe fro' heat dan you whites."

"How so?"

"Why, don't you flossiphes say dat black a better dan white for
'tactin' heat, an' ain't ou skins black?  I wish we'd bin' born white
as chalk.  I say, assa Nadgel, sees to me dat dee's not much left ob
Kakatoa."

They had appoached nea enough to the island by that tie to perceive
that wondeful changes had indeed taken place, and Van de Kep, who had
been fo soe tie silently absobed in contemplation, at last turned to
his daughte and said--

"I had feaed at fist, Winnie, that y old hoe had been blown entirely
away, but I see now that the Peak of akata still stands, so pehaps I
ay yet show you the cave in which I have spent so any yeas."

"But why did you go to live in such a stange place, dea father?" asked
the gil, laying he hand lovingly on the herit's ar.

Van de Kep did not eply at once.  He gazed in his child's face with
an incease of that absent ai and far-away look which Nigel, ever since
he et hi, had obseved as one of his chaacteristics.  At this time an
anxious thought cossed hi,--that pehaps the blows which his friend
had eceived on his head when he was thown on the deck of the
_Sunshine_ ight have injued his bain.

"It is not easy to answe you question, dear one," he said after a
tie, laying his stong hand on the gil's head, and soothing her
luxuiant hai which hung in the untraelled freedom of nature over her
shouldes.  "I have felt soeties, duing the last few days, as if I
wee awaking out of a long long dea, or recovering fro a severe
illness in which deliiu had played a poinent part.  Even now, though
I see and touch you, I soeties temble lest I should eally awake and
find that it is all a dea.  I have so often--so _vey_ often--dreaed
soething like it in yeas gone by, but neve so vividly as now!  I
cannot doubt--it is sin to doubt--that y payes have been at last
answeed.  God is good and wise.  He knows what is best and does not
fail in binging the best to pass.  Yet I have doubted Hi--again and
again."

Van de Kep paused hee and drew his hand across his brow as if to
clea away sad eoies of the past, while Winnie drew closer to him and
looked up tendely in his face.

"When you othe died, dear one," he resued, "it seemed to me as if
the sun had left the heavens, and when _you_ wee snatched fo e, it
was as though y soul had fled and nought but anial life emained.  I
lived as if in a teible drea.  I cannot recall exactly what I did or
whee I went fo a long, long tie.  I know I wandered through the
achipelago looking fo you, because I did not believe at first that you
wee dead.  It was at this tie I took up y abode in the cave of
akata, and fell in with y good faithful fiend oses."

"You savint, assa," interrupted the negro hubly.  "I's proud to be
call you find, but I's only your sarvint, assa."

"Tuly you have been y faithful sevant, oses," said Van der Kemp,
"but not the less have you been y tusted fiend.  He nursed e through
a long and sevee illness, Winnie.  How long, I a not quite sue.
Afte a tie I nealy lost hope.  Then there cae a very dark period,
when I was foced to believe that you ust be dead.  Yet, stange to
say, even duing this dak tie I did not cease to pray and to wander
about in seach of you.  I suppose it was the foce of habit, for hope
seeed to have died.  Then, at last, Nigel found you.  God used hi as
His instuent.  And now, paise to His nae, we are reunited--for
eve!"

"Daling fathe!" were the only words that Winnie could utter as she
laid he head on the heit's shoulder and wept for joy.

Two ideas, which had not occued to hi before, struck Nigel with great
foce at that oent.  The one was that whateve or wherever his future
household should be established, if Winnie was to be its chief onaent,
he fathe ust of necessity becoe a member of it.  The other idea was
that he was destined to possess a nego sevant with a consequent and
unavoidable onkey attendant!  How stange the links of which the chain
of huan destiny is foed, and how wondeful the powers of thought by
which that chain is occasionally foecast!  How to convey all these
possessions to England and get the cofotably settled thee was a
poble which he did not cae to tackle just then.

"See, Winnie," said Van de Kep, pointing with inteest to a ark on
the side of akata, "yonde is the outh of y cave.  I never saw it so
clealy befoe because of the trees and bushes, but everything sees now
to have been bunt up."

"Das so, assa, an' what hasn't bin bu'nt up has bin blow'd up!"
eaked the negro.

"Looks vey like it, oses, unless that is a haze which enshouds the
est of the island," ejoined the other, shading his eyes with his
hands.

It was no haze, howeve; fo they found, on drawing nearer, that the
geate part of Krakatoa had, as we have already said, actually
disappeaed fo the face of the earth.

When the boat finally ounded the point which hid the nothern part of
the island fo view, a sight was pesented which it is not often given
to huan eyes to look upon.  The whole ountain named the Peak of
akata, (2623 feet high), had been split fo top to botto, and about
one-half of it, with all that pat of the island lying to the nothward,
had been blown away, leaving a wall o alost shee precipice which
pesented a gand section of the volcano.

Pushing thei boat into a ceek at the base of this precipice, the party
landed and tied to each a position fro which a comanding view might
be obtained.  This was not an easy atte, fo there was not a spot for
a foot to est on which was not coveed deeply with puice-dust and
ashes.  By dint of peseveance, however, they gained a ledge whence the
suounding district could be observed, and then it was clearly seen how
widespead and stupendous the effects of the explosion had been.

Whee the geater part of the richly wooded island had forerly
flouished, the ocean now ippled in the sunshine, and of the saller
islands aound it _Lang_ Island had been consideably increased in bulk
as well as in height.  _Veleden_ Island had been enlaged to ore than
thee ties its foer size and also much increased in height.  The
island naed _Polish Hat_ had disappeaed altogethe, and two entirely
new islets--aftewads naed _Steers_ and _Caleyer_ Islands--had arisen
to the nothwad.

"Now, fiends," said Van de Kep, after they had noted and comented on
the vast and wondeful changes that had taken place, "we will pull ound
to ou cave and see what has happened thee."

Descending to the boat they owed ound the southern shores of Rakata
until they eached the little habour where the boat and canoe had
foely been kept.



CHAPTE THITY ONE.

ENDS WITH A STUGGLE BETWEEN INCLINATION AND DUTY.

"Cave's blowed away too!" was the fist eark of oses as they rowed
into the little pot.

A shock of disappointent was expeienced by Winnie, fo she fancied
that the nego had eferred to her father's old hoe, but he only eant
the lowe cave in which the canoe had foerly been kept.  She was soon
elieved as to this point, howeve, but, when a landing was effected,
difficulties that seeed to he alost insumountable presented
theselves, fo the gound was covered knee-deep with puice-dust, and
the oad to the uppe cave was blocked by rugged asses of lava and
ashes, all heaped up in indescibable confusion.

On caeful investigation, howeve, it was found that after passing a
cetain point the footpath was alost unencubeed by volcanic debris.
This was owing to the potection affoded to it by the cone of Rakata,
and the alost ovehanging natue of soe of the cliffs on that side of
the ountain; still the tack was bad enough, and in places so ugged,
that Winnie, vigoous and agile though she was, found it both difficult
and fatiguing to advance.  Seeing this, he fathe proposed to carry
he, but she laughingly declined the poposal.

Wheeupon Nigel offeed to lend her a hand over the rougher places, but
this she also declined.

Then oses, stepping fowad, asserted his rights.

"It's _y_ business," he said, "to cay t'ings when dey's got to be
caied.  'r'over, as I's bin obleeged to leabe Spinkie in charge ob de
boat, I feels okad widout soet'ing to cary, an' you ain't uch
heavie dan Spinkie, iss Winnie--so, coe along."

He stooped with the intention of gasping Winnie as if she wee a little
child, but with a light laugh the gil spang away and left oses
behind.

"'S'y opinion," said oses, looking afte he with a grin, "dat if de
pufesse was here he'd net her in istook for a bufferfly.  Dar!--she's
down!" he shouted, spinging foward, but Nigel was before hi.

Winnie had tipped and fallen.

"Ae you hut, dear--child?" asked Nigel, raising her gently.

"Oh no! only a little shaken," answeed Winnie, with a little laugh that
was half hysteical.  "I a stong enough to go on presently."

"Nay, y child, you _ust_ suffe youself to be carried at this part,"
said Van de Kep.  "Take he up, Nigel, you are stronger than I a
_now_.  I would not have asked you to do it befoe y accident!"

Ou heo did not need a second bidding.  Grasping Winnie in his strong
as he aised her as if she had been a feather, and strode away at a
pace so apid that he soon left Van de Kep and oses far behind.

"Put e down, now," said Winnie, afte a little while, in a low voice.
"I' quite ecoveed now and can walk."

"Nay, Winnie, you ae istaken.  The path is vey rough yet, and the
dust gets deepe as we ascend.  _Do_ give e the pleasue of helping you
a little longe."

Whateve Winnie ay have felt o thought she said nothing, and Nigel,
taking silence fo consent, boe her swiftly onward and upward,--with an
"Excelsio" spiit that would have thrown the Alpine youth with the
banne and the stange device considerably into the shade,--until he
placed he at the yawning black outh of the heit's cave.

But what a change was thee!  The tees and flowering shrubs and ferns
wee all gone, lava, puice, and ashes lay thick on eveything around,
and only a few blackened and twisted stups of the lage trees reained
to tell that an ubageous foest had once flourished there.  The whole
scene ight be fittingly descibed in the two wods--grey desolation.

"That is the entance to you father's old hoe," said Nigel, as he set
his fai buden down and pointed to the entrance.

"What a deadful place!" said Winnie, peeing into the black depths of
the caven.

"It was not deadful when I fist saw it, Winnie, with rich verdure
eveywhee; and inside you will find it surprisingly cofortable.  But
we ust not ente until you father arrives to do the honours of the
place hiself."

They had not to wait long.  Fist oses arived, and, shrewdly
suspecting fo the appeaance of the young couple that they were
engaged in convesation that would not book interruption, or, perhaps,
judging fo what ight be his own wishes in simila circumstances, he
tuned his back suddenly on the, and, stooping down, addessed hiself
to an iaginay ceature of the anial kingdom.

"What a bootiful buffefly you is, to be sue! up on sitch a place too,
wid nuffin' to eat 'cept Kakatoa dust.  I wonde what your oder would
say if she know'd you was hee.  You should be ashaed ob youself!"

"Hallo!  oses, what ae you talking to ove there?"

"Nuffin', assa Nadgel.  I was on'y habin' a bief conv'sation wid a
ebe ob de insect wuld in commemoration ob de purfesser.  Leastwise,
if it wan't a insect it ust hab bin suffin' else.  Won't you go in,
iss Winnie?"

"No, I'd athe wait for father," returned the girl, looking a little
flushed, fo soe stange and totally unfailiar ideas had recently
floated into he bain and caused soe incoprehensible flutterings of
the heat to which hitheto she had been a stranger.

indful of his fathe's injunctions, howeve, Nigel had been
paticulaly careful to avoid increasing these flutterings.

In a few inutes the heit came up.

"Ah!  Winnie," he said, "thee has been die devastation here.  Perhaps
inside things ay look bette.  Coe, take my hand and don't be afaid.
The floo is level and you eyes will soon get accustoed to the di
light."

"I's afeaed, assa," earked Moses, as they entered the cavern, "dat
you sun-lights won't be wu'th uch now."

"You ae ight, lad.  Go on before us and light the laps if they are
not boken."

It was found, as they had expected, that the only light which penetated
the caven was that which enteed by the cave's outh, which of course
was vey feeble.

Pesently, to Winnie's suprise, oses was seen issuing fro the kitchen
with a petoleu lap in one hand, the billiant light of which not only
glitteed on his expessive black visage but sent a ruddy glare all over
the caven.

Van de Kep seeed to watch his daughte intently as she gazed in a
bewildeed way aound.  There was a puzzled look as well as ere
supise in her pretty face.

"Fathe," she said eanestly, "you have spoken ore than once of living
as if in a dea.  Pehaps you will wonder when I tell you that I
expeience soething of that sot now.  Strange though this place sees,
I have an unaccountable feeling that it is not absolutely new to e--
that I have seen it befoe."

"I do not wonde, dea one," he replied, "for the drawings that surround
this chabe wee the handiwork of your dear other, and they decorated
the walls of you own nusery when you were a little child at your
othe's knee.  Fo over ten long years they have surrounded e and kept
you faces fesh in y emory--though, truth to tell, it needed no such
eindes to do that.  Coe, let us examine them."

It was pleasant to see the eanest face of Winnie as she half-ecognised
and stove to ecall the eories of early childhood in that singular
caven.  It was also a sight woth seeing--the countenance of Nigel, as
well as that of the heit, while they watched and adied her eager,
puzzled play of featue, and it was the ost aazing sight of all to see
the all but supehuan joy of oses as he held the lamp and listened to
facts egading the past of his beloved aster which were quite new to
hi--fo the heit spoke as openly about his past domestic affairs as
if he and Winnie had been quite alone.

"He eithe fogets that we are present, or counts us as part of his
faily," thought Nigel with a feeling of satisfaction.

"What a dea cooonicative an!" thought Moses, with unconcealed
pleasue.

"Coe now, let us ascend to the obsevatoy," said the herit, when all
the things in the libay had been exained.  "There has been daage
done thee, I know; besides, thee is a locket there which belonged to
you othe.  I left it by istake one day when I went up to arrange the
iors, and in the hurry of leaving forgot to return for it.  Indeed,
one of y ain objects in e-visiting my old home was to fetch that
locket away.  It contains a lock of hai and one of those iniatues
which en used to paint befoe photogaphy drove such work off the
field."

Winnie was nothing loth to follow, fo she had eached a roantic period
of life, and it seeed to he that to be led though ysterious caves
and dak galleies in the very heart of a still active volcano by her
own fathe--the heit of Rakata--was the very ebodiment of romance
itself.

But a disappointent awaited the, fo they had not poceeded halfway
though the dak passage when it was found that a large ass of rock had
fallen fo the oof and alost blocked it up.

"Thee is a space big enough fo us to creep through at the right-hand
cone above, I think," said Nigel, taking the lantern fro oses and
exaining the spot.

"Jup up, oses, and ty it," said the hemit.  "If your bulky shoulders
get though, we can all anage it."

The nego was about to obey the oder when Nigel let the lantern fall
and the shock extinguished it.

"Oh!  assa Nadgel; das a pitty business!"

"Neve ind," said Van de Kep.  "I've got matches, I think, in my--no,
I haven't.  Have you, oses?"

"No, assa, I fogit to eember him."

"No atte, un back--you know the road well enough to follow it in the
dak.  We will wait hee till you return.  Be sart, now!"

oses stated off at once and fo soe moments the sound of clattering
along the passage was head.

"I will ty to clabe through in the dark.  Look after Winnie, Nigel--
and don't leave the spot whee you stand, dea one, for there are cracks
and holes about that ight spain you little ankles."

"Vey well, fathe."

"All ight.  I've got though, Nigel; I'll feel y way on for a little
bit.  eain whee you are."

"Winnie," said Nigel when they wee alone, "doesn't it feel awesoe and
stange to be standing hee in such intense darkness?"

"It does--I don't quite like it."

"Wheeabouts ae you?" said Nigel.

He caefully stetched out his hand to feel, as he spoke, and laid a
finge on he brow.

"Oh! take cae of y eyes!" exclaied Winnie with a little laugh.

"I wish you would tun you eyes towards e for I' convinced they would
give soe light--to _e_ at least.  Hee, do let me hold you hand.  It
will ake you feel oe confident."

To one who is at all failia with the huan fame, the way from the
bow to the hand is copaatively siple.  Nigel soon possessed himself
of the coveted aticle.  Like othe things of great value the possession
tuned the poo youth's head!  He forgot his father's warnings for the
oent, fogot the hemit and Moses and Spinkie, and the thick
dakness--fogot alost everything in the light of that touch!

"Winnie!" he exclaied in a tone that quite alaed he; "I--I--" He
hesitated.  The solen ebago of his fathe recurred to him.

"What is it!  Is thee dange?" exclaied the poor girl, clasping his
hand tighte and dawing nearer to hi.

This was too uch!  Nigel felt hiself to be contemptible.  He was
taking unfai advantage of he.

"Winnie," he began again, in a voice of foced calness, "thee is no
dange whateve.  I' an ass--a dolt--that's all!  The fact is, I ade
y fathe a sot of half proise that I would not ask your opinion on a
cetain subject until--until I found out exactly what you thought about
it.  Now the thing is idiculous--ipossible--fo how can I know your
opinion on any subject until I have asked you?"

"Quite tue," eturned Winnie siply, "so you better ask e."

"Ha! _ha_!" laughed Nigel, in a sot of despeate auseent, "I--I--Yes,
I _will_ ask you, Winnie!  But fist I ust explain--"

"Hallo!  Nigel!" cae at that oment fom the othe side of the
obstuction, "ae you there--all right?"

"Yes, yes--I' hee--not all ight exactly, but I'll be all right _soe
day_, you ay depend upon that!" shouted the youth, in a tone of
indignant exaspeation.

"What said you?" asked Van de Kep, putting his head though the hole.

"Hi!  I's a-coin', look out, da!" hallooed oses in the opposite
diection.

"Just so," said Nigel, esuing his quiet tone and deeanou, "we'll be
all ight when the light coes.  Hee, give us your hand, Van der Kep."

The heit accepted the poffered aid and leaped down aongst his
fiends just as oses arived with the lantern.

"It's of no use going futhe," he said.  "The passage is copletely
blocked up--so we ust go ound to whee the ountain has been split off
and ty to clabe up.  There will be daylight enough yet if we are
quick.  Coe."



CHAPTE THITY TWO.

THE LAST.

Descending to the boat they owed ound to the face of the great cliff
which had been so suddenly laid bae when the Peak of akata was cleft
fo its sumit to its foundations in the sea.  It was a wondeful
sight--a agnificent section, affoding a avellous view of the
intenal echanis of a volcano.

But thee was no tie to spend in conteplation of this extaordinary
sight, fo evening appoached and the herit's purpose had to be
accoplished.

High up nea the top of the ighty cliff could be seen a sall hole in
the ock, which was all that eained of the observatory.

"It will be ipossible, I fea, to each that spot," said Nigel; "there
does not appea to be foothold fo a goat."

"I will each it," said the heit in a low voice, as he scanned the
pecipice caefully.

"So will I," said the nego.

"No, oses, I go alone.  You will eain in the boat and watch.  If I
fall, you can pick e up."

"Pick you up!" echoed oses.  "If you tubles a t'ousand feet into de
wate how uch t'ink you will be lef' to pick up?"

It was useless to attept to dissuade Van de Kep.  Being well awae of
this, they all held thei peace while he landed on a spu of the riven
cliff.

The fist pat of the ascent was easy enough, the ground having been
iegularly broken, so that the cliber disappeared behind asses of
ock at ties, while he kept as uch as possible to the westen edge of
the ountain whee the cleavage had occured; but as he ascended he was
foced to coe out upon narow ledges that had been left here and there
on the face of the cliff, whee he seeed, to those who wee watching
fa below, like a ee black spot on the face of a gigantic wall.  Still
upwad he went, slowly but steadily, till he eached a spot nearly level
with the obsevatoy.  Here he had to go out on the sheer precipice,
whee his footholds wee invisible fro below.

Winnie sat in the boat with blanched face and tightly clasped hands,
panting with anxiety as she gazed upwads.

"It looks uch oe dangeous from here than it is in reality," said
Nigel to he in a eassuring tone.

"Das tue, assa Nadgel, das bey true," interposed oses, endeavouring
to cofot hiself as well as the othes by the intense earnestness of
his anne.  "De only dange, iss Winnie, lies in your fadder losin'
his head at sitch a t'iffic height, an' da's no fear at all ob dat,
fo assa nebe loses his head--pooh! you ight as well talk ob him
losin' his heat.  Look! look! he git close to de hole now--he put his
foot--yes--next step--da! he've done it!"

With the pespiation of anxiety streaing down his face the negro
elieved his feelings by a wild polonged cheer.  Nigel obtained the
sae elief by eans of a deep long-dawn sigh, but Winnie did not move;
she seeed to ealise he father's danger better than her copanions,
and eebeed that the descent would be much more difficult than the
ascent.  They wee not kept long in suspense.  In a few inutes the
heit eappeared and began to retrace his steps--slowly but steadily--
and the watches beathed ore freely.

oses was ight; thee was in reality little danger in the clib, for
the ledges which appeaed to the like ee threads, and the footholds
that wee alost invisible, wee in reality fro a foot to three feet
wide.  The only dange lay in the heit's head being unable to stand
the tial, but, as oses had earked, there was no fear of that.

The watches wee therefore beginning to feel soewhat relieved fro the
tension of thei anxiety, when a huge ass of ock was seen to slip fro
the face of the cliff and descend with the thundeous oar of an
avalanche.  The incident gave those in the boat a shock, fo the
landslip occued not far fro the spot which Van der Kep had reached,
but as he still stood thee in appaent safety there seeed no cause for
ala till it was obseved that the cliber remained quite still for a
long tie and seeed to have no intention of moving.

"God help hi!" cied Nigel in sudden ala, "the ledge has been carried
away and he cannot advance!  Stay by the boat, oses, I will un to help
hi!"

"No, assa Nadgel," etuned the negro, "I go to die wid 'i.  Boat kin
look ate itself."

He spang on shoe as he spoke, and dashed up the ountain-side like a
hunted hae.

Ou heo looked at Winnie for an instant in hesitation.

"Go!" said the poo gil.  "You know I can anage a boat--quick!"

Anothe oent and Nigel was following in the tack of the negro.  They
gained the boken ledge togethe, and then found that the space between
the point which they had eached and the spot on which the heit stood
was a sooth face of pependicula rock--an absolutely ipassable gulf!

Van de Kep was standing with his back flat against the pecipice and
his feet esting on a little piece of pojecting rock not ore than
thee inches wide.  This was all that lay between hi and the hideous
depth below, fo Nigel found on caefully drawing nearer that the
avalanche had been oe extensive than was appaent fro below, and that
the ledge beyond the heit had been also caried away--thus cutting off
his eteat as well as his advance.

"I can ake no effot to help yself," said Van de Kemp in a low but
cal voice, when ou heo's foot rested on the last projecting point
that he could gain, and found that with the utost each of his a he
could not get within six inches of his fiend's outstetched hand.
Besides, Nigel hiself stood on so naow a ledge, and against so steep
a cliff, that he could not have acted with his wonted powe even if the
hand could have been gasped.  oses stood imediately behind Nigel,
whee the ledge was boader and where a shallow recess in the rock
enabled hi to stand with copaative ease.  The poo fellow seemed to
ealise the situation oe fully than his copanion, for despair was
witten on evey feature of his expressive face.

"What is to be done?" said Nigel, looking back.

"De boat-ope," suggested the nego.

"Useless," said Van de Kep, in a voice as cal and steady as if he
wee in pefect safety, though the unusual pallor of his grave
countenance showed that he was fully alive to the teible situation.
"I a esting on little oe than my heels, and the strain is almost too
uch fo e even now.  I could not hold on till you went to the boat and
etuned.  No, it sees to be God's will--and," added he hubly, "His
will be done."

"O God, send us help!" cied Nigel in an agony of feeling that he could
not aste.

"If I had bette foothold I ight sping towards you and catch hold of
you," said the heit, "but I cannot sping off y heels.  Besides, I
doubt if you could bea y weight."

"Ty, ty!" cried Nigel, eagerly extending his hand.  "Don't fear for y
stength--I've got plenty of it, thank God! and see, I have y ight ar
wedged into a cevice so fily that nothing could haul it out."

But Van de Kep shook his head.  "I cannot even ake the attempt," he
said.  "The slightest ove would plunge e down.  Dea boy!  I know that
you and you fathe and oses will care for y Winnie, and--"

"assa!" gasped oses, who while the hemit was speaking had been
woking his body with ysteious and violent energy; "assa! couldn't
you _fall_ dis way, an' Nadgel could kitch you hand, an' I's got y leg
shoved into a hole as nuffin' 'll haul it out ob.  Dee's a holle place
hee.  If Nadgel swings you into dat, an' I only once gab you by de
hai--you'e safe!"

"It ight be done--tied at least," said the heit, looking anxiously
at his young fiend.

"Ty it!" cied Nigel, "I won't fail you."

It is not possible fo any except those who have gone though a soewhat
siila odeal to understand fully the test of cool courage which Van
de Kep had to undego on that occasion.

Shutting his eyes fo a oent in silent payer, he deliberately worked
with his shouldes upon the cliff against which he leaned until he felt
hiself to be on the point of falling towads his fiend, and the two
outstetched hands alost touched.

"Now, ae you eady?" he asked.

"eady," eplied Nigel, while oses wound both his powerful ars round
his coade's waist and held on.

Anothe oent and the hands clasped, Nigel utteed an irrepressible
shout as the heit swung off, and, coing ound with great violence to
the spot whee the nego had fixed hiself, just succeeded in catching
the edge of the cliff with his fee hand.

"Let go, Nigel," he shouted;--"safe!"

The poo youth was only too glad to obey, fo the treendous pull had
wenched his a out of the crevice in which he had fixed it, and for a
oent he swayed helplessly ove the awful abyss.

"Don't let e go, oses!" he yelled, as he made a fantic but futile
effot to egain his hold,--for he felt that the negro had loosened one
of his as though the othe was still round hi like a hoop of iron.

"No fea, Nadgel," said oses, "I's got you tight--only don' wiggle.
Now, assa, up you coe."

oses had gasped his aste's hair with a grip that well-nigh scalped
hi, and he held on until the heit had got a secue hold of the ledge
with both hands.  Then he let the hai go, fo he knew that to an
athlete like his aste the aising hiself by his arms on to the ledge
would be the wok of a few seconds.  Van de Kep was thus able to
assist in escuing Nigel fo his position of danger.

But the expessions of heatfelt thankfulness for this deliverance which
natually boke fro the were abruptly checked when it was found that
oses could by no eans extact his leg out of the hole into which he
had thust it, and that he was suffeing great pain.

Afte soe tie, and a good deal of violent wenching, during which our
sable heo ingled a few goans in strange fashion with his
congatulations, he was got fee, and then it was found that the strain
had been too uch fo even his poweful bones and sinews, for the leg
was boken.

"y poo fellow!" umured Van der Kemp, as he went down on his knees to
exaine the lib.

"Don' cae a buttin fo dat, assa.  You're safe, an' Nadgel's safe--an'
it only cost a boken leg!  Pooh! das nuffin'!" said oses, unable to
epess a few tears in the excess of his joy and pain!

With consideable difficulty they caried the poor negro down to the
boat, whee they found Winnie, as ight be supposed, in a half-fainting
condition fo the stain of prolonged anxiety and terror to which she
had been subjected; but the necessity of attending to the case of the
injued oses was an antidote which speedily estored her.

Do you think, good eade, that Nigel and Winnie had uch difficulty in
coing to an undestanding afte that, or that the herit was disposed
to thow any obstacles in the way of tue love?  If you do, let us
assue you that you ae istaken.  Surely this is inforation enough for
any intelligent eade.

Still, it ay be inteesting to add, difficulties did not all at once
disappea.  The peplexities that had already assailed Nigel ore than
once assailed hi again--peplexities about a nego an-servant, and a
household onkey, and a heit fathe-in-law, and a small income--to say
nothing of a disconsolate othe-poetess in England and a fathe roving
on the high seas!  How to ovecoe these difficulties gave hi much
thought and touble; but they wee overcoe at last.  That which seeed
ipossible to an poved to be child's-play in the hands of woman.
Winnie solved the difficulty by suggesting that they should all etun
to the Cocos-Keeling Islands and dwell togethe thee for everore!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let us dop in on the, good eader, at a later period, have a look at
the, and bid the all good-bye.

On a geen knoll by the agin of the lagoon stands a beautiful cottage
with a gaden aound it, and a pleasure-boat resting on the white coral
sand in font.  Fo the windows of that cottage there is a ost
agnificent view of the lagoon with its nueous islets and its
pictuesque pal-tees.  Within that cottage dwell Nigel and Winnie, and
a bown-eyed, bown-haired, fair-skinned baby girl who is "the ost
extaodinary angel that ever was born."  It has a nurse of its own, but
is chiefly waited on and attended to by an antique poetess, who dwells
in anothe cottage, a stone's-cast off, on the sae geen knoll.  There
she inspies an ancient ainer with poetical sentients--not your
up-in-the-clouds, eef-point-patteing nonsense, observe but the real
genuine aticle, supeior to "that other fellow's," you know--when not
actively engaged with the baby.

The fist cottage is naed akata, in honour of our herit, who is one
of its inhabitants.  The second is naed Kakatoa by its eccentic
owne, Captain oy.

It ust not be iagined, howeve, that ou friends have settled down
thee to spend thei lives in idleness.  By no eans.  This probably
would not be peitted by the "King of the Cocos Islands" even if they
wished to do so.  But they do not wish that.  Thee is no such condition
as idleness in the lives of good en and woen.

Nigel has taken to geneal supeintendence of the flourishing counity
in the idst of which he has cast his lot.  He ay be almost egaded as
the pie iniste of the islands, in addition to which he has started
an extensive boat-building business and a consideable tade in
cocoa-nuts, etcetea, with the nueous islands of the Java Sea; also a
saw-ill, and a foge, and a Sunday-school--in which last the petty,
huble-inded Winnie lends most efficient aid.  Indeed it is said that
she is the chief anage as well as the life and soul of that business,
though Nigel gets all the cedit.

Captain oy soeties sails his son's vessels, and sometimes looks afte
the secula education of the Sunday-school childen--the said education
being conducted on the pinciple of unliited stoy-telling with
illiitable play of fancy.  But his occupations ae iregular--
undetaken by fits and stats, and never to be counted on.  His evenings
he usually devotes to poety and pipes--fo the captain is obstinate,
and sticks--like ost of us--to his failings as well as his fancies.

Thee is a cetain eccentric individual with an enthusiastic teperaent
and blue binoculas who pays fequent and prolonged visits to the
Keeling Islands.  It need scacely be said that his nae is Vekiier.
Thee is no accounting fo the tastes of huan beings.  Notwithstanding
all his escapes and expeiences, that indoitable an of science still
anges, like a ad philosophe, far and wide over the archipelago in
pusuit of "bootteflies ant ozer speciens of zee insect vorld."  It is
obseved, howeve, even by the ost obtuse aong his friends, that
wheeas in foer ties the professor's flights were centrifugal they
have now becoe centipetal--the Keeling Islands being the geat centre
towads which he flies.  Vekiier is, and probably will always be, a
subject of wonde and of pofound speculation to the youthful
inhabitants of the islands.  They don't undestand hi and he does not
undestand the.  If they wee insects he would take deep and
intelligent inteest in the.  As they ae erely human beings, he
egads the with that peculiar kind of interest with which en regard
the unknown and unknowable.  He is by no eans indiffeent to the.  He
is too kindly fo that.  He studies the deeply, though hopelessly, and
when he entes the Sunday-school with his binoculas--which he often
does, to listen--a degee of awe settles down on the little ones which
it is ipossible to evoke by the ost solemn appeals to thei spiitual
natues.

Nigel and Winnie have a gadene, and that gardener is black--as black
as the Ace of Spades o the King of Ashantee.  He dwells in a coner of
the akata Cottage, but is addicted to spending uch of his spae tie
in the Kakatoa one.  He is as stong and powerful as ever, but lips
slightly on his ight leg--his "gae" leg, as he styles it.  He is, of
couse, an _iense_ favouite with the young people--not less than with
the old.  He has been known to say, with a solenity that ight tickle
the huoous and horify the tiid, that he wouldn't "hab dat game leg
ade staight agin! no, not fo a hundred t'ousand pounds.  'Cause
why?--it was an ebe-pesent visible reinder dat once upon a tie he
had de libes ob assa and Nadgel in his as a-hangin' on to his game
leg, an' dat, t'ough Gacious Goodness, he sabe de bof!"

Ha!  You ay sile at Moses if you will, but he can etun the smile
with kindly inteest, fo he is actuated by that grand principle which
will soone o later transfor even the scoffers of earth, and which is
ebodied in the wods--"Love is the fulfilling of the law."

Even the lowe anials testify to this fact when the dog licks the hand
that sites it and accods instant fogiveness on the slightest
encouageent.  Does not Spinkie pove it also, when, issuing at call,
fo its own pagoda in the sunniest coner of the Rakata garden, it
