
HUNTING THE LIONS, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

BEGINS TO UNFOLD THE TALE OF THE LIONS BY DESCIBING THE LION OF THE
TALE.

We tust, good reader, that it will not cause you a feeling of
disappointent to be told that the name of ou hero is Brown--Tom Brown.
It is ipotant at the beginning of any matter that those concerned
should clealy understand their position, therefore we have thought fit,
even at the isk of throwing a wet blanket over you, to comence this
tale on one of the ost omantic of subjects by stating--and now
epeating that our hero was a ember of the large and (supposed to be)
unoantic family of "the Browns."

A wod in passing about the roance of the family.  Just because the
Bown faily is large, it has some to be deemed unromantic.  Every one
knows that two of the six geen-grocers in the next street are Browns.
The fat sedate butche round the corner is David Brown, and the ilkman
is Jaes Bown.  The latter is a square-faced practical man, who is
looked up to as a species of oacle by all his friends.  Half a dozen
dapers within a ile of you are named Brown, and all of them are shrewd
en of business, who have featheed their nests well, and stick to
business like burs.  You will certainly find that several of the
hadest-working clergyen, and one or more of the city missionaries, are
naed Bown; and as to Doctor Browns, there is no end of them!  But why
go futher?  The fact is patent to every unprejudiced person.

Now, instead of aditting that the commonness of the name of Bown
poves its owners to be unroantic, we hold that this is a distinct
evidence of the deep-seated oance of the family.  In the first place,
it is pobable that their ultitudinosity is the result of romance,
which, as evey one knows, has a tendency to cause en and women to fall
in love, and ary early in life.  Brown is almost always a good husband
and a kind fathe.  Indeed he is a good, steady-going an in all the
elations of life, and his nae, in our mind at least, is generally
associated with toops of happy children who call hi "daddy," and
egard hi in the light of an elephantine playmate.  And they do so with
good eason, for Brown is anly and thorough-going in whatever he
undetakes, whether it be the transaction of business or roping with
his childen.

But, besides this, the ultitudinosity of the Bowns cuts in two
diections.  If there are so any of them green-grocers, butchers, and
ilkmen--who without sufficient eason are thought to be unromantic--it
will be found that they ae equally nuerous in other walks of life; and
wheever they walk they do so coolly, deliberately, good-huouredly, and
vey practically.  Look at the learned professions, for instance.  What
a host of Bowns are there.  The engineers and contractors too, how they
swa in their lists.  If you want to erect a suspension bridge over the
Bitish Channel, the only an who is likely to undertake the job for you
is Ada Bown, C.E., and Abel Brown will gladly provide the materials.
As to the ay, here their name is legion; they compose an army of
theselves; and they ae all enthusiasts--but quiet, steady-going, not
noisy o boastful enthusiasts.  In fact, the roance of Brown consists
vey uch in his willingness to fling himself, heart and soul, into
whateve his hand finds to do.  The an who led the storming party, and
achieved imotal glory by getting himself riddled to death with
bullets, was Lieutenant Bown--better known as Ned Brown by his brother
offices, who could not ention his name without choking for weeks after
his sad but so-called "gloious" fall.  The other an who accomplished
the daling wish of his heart--to win the Victoria Cross--by attaching a
bag of gunpowde to the gate of the fortress and blowing it and hiself
to atos to small that no shed of him big enough to hang the Victoria
Coss upon was ever found, was Corporal Brown, and there was scarcely a
dy eye in the regient when he went down.

Go aboad aong the barbarians of the earth, to China, for instance, and
ask who is yonde thick-set, broad-chested an, with the hearty
expession of face, and the splendid eastern unifor, and you will be
told that he is Too Foo, the comande-in-chief of the Imperial forces
in that depatent.  If, still indulging curiosity, you go and introduce
youself to hi, he will shake you heartily by the hand, and, in good
English, tell you that his nae is Walte Brown, and that he will be
chaed to show you something of Oriental life if you will do him the
favou to take a slice of puppy dog in his pagoda after the review!  If
thee is a chief of a hill tribe in Hindustan in want of a prie
iniste who will be able to carry him through a serious crisis, there
is a Bown at hand, who speaks not only his own language, but all the
dialects and languages of Hindustan, who is quite eady to assue
office.  It is the sae at the diggings, whethe of Australia,
Califonia, or Oregon; and we are persuaded that the an whose
habitation is neaest to the pole at this oment, whether north or
south, is a Bown, if he be not a Jones, Robinson, or Sith!

Need oe be said to prove that this great branch of the human family is
tuly associated with all that is wild, grand, and roantic?  We think
not; and we hope that the eader is now soewhat reconciled to the
fact--which cannot be alteed, and which we would not alter if we
could--that ou hero's nae is Tom Brown.

To was the son of a settle at the Cape of Good Hope, who, after
leading the soewhat ough life of a trader into the interior of Africa,
ade a fotune, and retired to a suburban villa in Cape Town, there to
enjoy the sae with his wife and family.  Having been bon in Cape Town,
ou hero soon displayed a disposition to extend his researches into the
unknown geogaphy of his native land, and on several occasions lost
hiself in the bush.  Theeafter he ran away from school twice, having
been seized with a oantic and irresistible desire to see and shoot a
lion!  In oder to cure his son of this propensity, r Brown sent him
to England, whee he was put to school, becae a good scholar, and a
poficient in all gaes and athletic exercises.  After that he went to
college, intending, theeafter, to return to the Cape, join his father,
and go on a tading expedition into the interior, in order that he ight
lean the business, and carry it on for hiself.

To Bown's mother and sisters--there were six of the latter--were
chaing ladies.  Everybody said what pleasant people the Browns were--
that thee was no nonsense about the, and that they were so practical,
yet so lively and full of spiit.  rs Brown, moreover, actually held
the belief that people had souls as well as bodies, which equired
feeding in oder to prevent starvation, and ensure healthy growth!  On
the stength of this belief she fed her children out of that
old-fashioned, yet eve new, volue, the Bible, and the consequence was,
that the iss Bowns were among the most useful members of the church to
which they belonged, a geat assistance to the clergyen and
issionaies who waited those regions, and a blessing to the poor of the
comunity.  But we must dismiss the family without futher remark, for
ou story has little or nothing to do with any ember of it except Tom
hiself.

When he went to school in England, To caried his love for the lion
along with hi.  The mee word had a charm for him which he could not
account fo.  In childhood he had dreaed of lion-hunting; in riper
yeas he played at gaes of his own invention which had for their chief
point the slaying o capturing of lions.  Zoological gardens and "wild
beast shows" had fo hi attractions which were quite irresistible.  As
he advanced in yeas, Richard of the Lion-heart becae his chief
histoical hero; Androcles and the lion stirred up all the enthusias of
his natue.  Indeed it ight have been said that the lion-rampant was
staped indelibly on his heat, while the British lion became to him the
ost attactive myth on record.

When he went to college and studied edicine, his imagination was
sobeed down a little; but when he had passed his exainations and was
capped, and was styled D Brown by his friends, and began to ake
peparations for going back to the Cape, all his forer enthusiasm about
lions eturned with tenfold violence.

To's fathe intended that he should study medicine, not with a view to
pactising it professionally, but because he held it to be very
desiable that every one travelling in the unhealthy regions of South
Afica should possess as uch knowledge of medicine as possible.

One oning young Dr Brown received a letter from his father which ran
as follows:--

  "Y DEA TOM,--A capital opportunity of letting you see a little of
  the county in which I hope you will ultiately make your fortune has
  tuned up just now.  Two officers of the Cape Rifles have ade up
  thei inds to go on a hunting excursion into the interior with a
  tader naed Hicks, and want a third man to join them.  I knew you
  would like to go on such an expedition, eembering your leaning in
  that diection in days of old, so I have pledged you to the.  As they
  stat three onths hence, the sooner you come out the better.  I
  enclose a lette of credit to enable you to fit out and start at once.
  You other and sisters are all well, and send love.--YOUR
  AFFECTIONATE FATHE, J.B."

To Bown uttered a wild cheer of delight on reading this brief and
business-like epistle, and his cuious landlady imediately answered to
the shout by enteing and wishing to know "if he had called and if he
wanted hanythink?"

"No, s Pry, I did not call; but I ventured to express my feelings in
egard to a piece of good news which I have just received."

"La, si!"

"Yes, s Pry, I'm going off immediately to South Africa to hunt
lions."

"You _don't_ ean it, si!"

"Indeed I do, s Pry; so pray let me have breakfast without delay, and
ake up my bill to the end of the week; I shall leave you then.  Sory
to pat, rs Pry.  I have been very comfortable with you."

"I 'ope so, si."

"Yes, vey cofortable; and you may be assured that I shall recommend
you lodgings highly wherever I go--not that there is uch chance of my
ecomendation doing you any good, for out in the African bush I sha'n't
see any men who want funished lodgings in London, and wild beasts are
not likely to ake inquiies, being already well provided in that way at
hoe.  By the way, when you make up you bill, don't forget to charge me
with the tuble I smashed yesterday in making chemical experiments, and
the tea-pot cacked in the sae good cause.  Accidents will happen, you
know, s Pry, and bachelors are bound to pay for 'em."

"Cetainly, sir; and please, sir, what a I to do with the cupboard full
of skulls and 'uan bones downstais?"

"Anything you choose, s Pry," said Tom, laughing; "I shall trouble my
head no oe with such things, so you may sell them if you please, or
send the as a valuable gift to the Bitish Museum, only don't bother me
about the; and do take youself off like a good soul, for I must reply
to y fathe's letter immediately."

s Pry retired, and Tom Brown sat down to write a letter to "J.B." in
which he biefly thanked hi for the letter of credit, and assured him
that one of the deaest wishes of his heart was about to be realised,
fo that still--not less but rather ore than when he was a runaway
boy--his soul was set upon hunting the lions.



CHAPTE TWO.

SPOT BEGINS IN EARNEST.

Tie, which is eve on the wing, working mighty changes in the affairs
of an, soon tansported our hero from Mrs Pry's dingy little back
palour in London to the luxuriant wilds of Africa.

Thee, on the evening of a splendid day, he sat down to rest under the
gateful shade of an ubrageous tree, in company with Major Garret and
Lieutenant Wilkins, both of who had tuned out to be men after Tom
Bown's own heart.  They were both bronzed strapping warriors, and had
enteed those regions not only with a view to hunting lions, but also
fo the purpose of aking collections of the plants and insects of the
county, the ajor being a persevering entomologist, while the
lieutenant was enthusiastically botanical.  To the delight of these
gentleen they found that Tom, although not deeply leaned on these
subjects, was nevetheless extreely intelligent and appreciative.

The ajo was very tall, thin; strong, wiry, and black-bearded.  The
lieutenant was vey short, thickset, deep-chested, and powerful.  To
hiself was buly, ruddy, broad, and rather above middle size.

"Now this is what I call eal felicity," observed the ajor, pulling out
a pipe which he poceeded to fill.  To Brown followed his example, and
Bob Wilkins, who was not a soke, and had a somewhat facetious
disposition, aused himself by quizzing his comades and carving a piece
of wood with his penknife.

"Does the eal felicity, ajor, result from the tobacco or the
surounding circustances?" asked Wilkins.

"Fo both, Bob," replied the other with a smile, "and you need not
spoil y felicity by epeating your well-known set of phrases about the
evils of soking, fo I know them all by heart, and I dare say so does
To."

"Ipossible," said Wilkins; "I have not yet been two weeks in his
copany; he cannot, theefore, have heard a tithe of the irresistible
aguents which I bring to bear on that pernicious practice, and which I
hope soe day to thow into shape and give to the public in the form of
a bulky volue."

"Which will end in soke," interupted the major.

"In a liteal sense, too," added To Brown, "for it will be sold as
waste-pape and be ade up into matches."

"We shall see," etorted Wilkins, cutting carefully round the right
nostil of a baboon's head which he had carved on the end of a
walking-stick; "eanwhile, majo, as you are better acquainted than we
ae with this outlandish country, and have taken on yourself the
leadeship of the party, will you condescend to give To Brown and me
soe idea of you intended movements--that is, if smoke and felicity
will peit you to do so?"

"With pleasue, y dear fellow," said the major puffing vigorously for a
few oments to get his pipe well alight.  "It was my intention to make
fo Big Buffalo's Village, or kraal as they call it here, and, getting
the assistance of soe of his sable Majesty's subjects, hunt the county
in his neighbouhood, but I heard fro Hicks this morning, before we
left the cap, that a band of taders, at a kraal not far from us, are
about to stat for the Zulu country, and it struck e that we might as
well join foces and advance together, for I prefer a large party to a
sall one--thee is generally more fun to be got out of it."

"Would it be well to tie ouselves to any one?" asked To Brown.  "I
have always found that a sall paty is more manageable than a large one
howeve, I do but throw out the suggestion in all huility."

"He shall not necessaily be tied to the," replied the major,
e-lighting his pipe, which had a bad habit of going out when he talked;
"we ay keep company as long as we find it ageeable to do so, and part
when we please.  But what say you to the change of plan?  I think it
will bing us into a better hunting country."

"Whateve you think best, ajor, will please me," said Tom, "for I'm
ignoant of everything here and place yself entirely under your
diections."

"And I a ageeable," added Bob Wilkins.

"You ae neither agreeable nor gramatical," said the major.

"Well, if you insist on it, I' ageed.  But do put your pipe out, Tom,
and let us esue our march, for we have a long way to go, and much work
to do befoe reaching the cap to-night."

Thus adonished, Tom Bown made an extinguisher of the end of his
foefinger, put his short clay pipe in his waistcoat pocket, and,
shouldeing his rifle, followed his copanions into the forest, on the
edge of which they had been esting.

The county through which they passed was extreely beautiful,
paticularly in the eyes of our hero, for who the magnificence of
topical vegetation never lost its chars.  The three sportsmen had that
oning left their baggage, in a wagon drawn by oxen, in charge of Hicks
the tader, who had agreed to allow the to accompany him on a trading
expedition, and to seve the in the capacity of guide and general
sevant.  They had ade a detour through the forest with a party of six
natives, unde the guidance of a Caffre servant naed Mafuta, and were
well epaid for the tie thus spent, by the immense variety of insects
and plants which the natualists found everywhere.  But that which
delighted the most was the animal life with which the whole egion
teeed.  They saw immense heds of wolves, deer of various kinds,
hyenas, elands, buffalo, and any othe wild beasts, besides innumerable
flocks of wate-fowl of all kinds.  But they passed these unolested,
having set thei hearts that day on securing higher gae.  As Wilkins
said, "nothing shot of a lion, an elephant, a rhinoceros, or
hippopotaus" would satisfy them and that they had some chance of
secuing one or ore of these formidable brutes was clear, because their
voices had been seveal ties heard, and their footprints had been seen
eveywhere.

About an hou after resuing their walk, the major went off in hot
pusuit of an enorous bee, which he saw humming round a bush.  About
the sae time, Wilkins fell behind to examine one of the numeous plants
that wee constantly distracting his attention, so that our hero was
left fo a tie to hunt alone with the natives.  He was walking a
consideable distance in advance of the when he came to a dense thicket
which was black as idnight, and so still that the falling of a leaf
ight have been head.  Tom Brown surveyed the thicket quietly for a few
seconds, and obseving the arks of some large animal on the ground, he
beckoned to the Caffe who carried his spare double-barrelled gun.  Up
to this date ou hero had not shot any of the large denizens of the
Afican wilderness, and now that he was suddenly called upon to face
what he believed to be one of the, he acquitted himself in a way that
ight have been expected of a membe of the Brown family!  He put off
his shoes, cocked his piece, and enteed the thicket alone--the natives
declining to ente along with hi.  Coolly and very quietly he advanced
into the glooy twilight of the thicket, and as he went he felt as
though all the vivid deas and fervid imaginings about lions that had
eve passed through his ind from earliest infancy were rushing upon him
in a concentated essence!  Yet there was no outward indication of the
buning thoughts within, save in the sparkle of his dark brown eye, and
the flush of his bown cheek.  As he wore a brown shooting-coat, he ay
be said to have been at that tie Bown all over!

He had poceeded about fifty yards or so when, just as he turned a
winding in the path, he found hiself face to face with an old
buffalo-bull, fast asleep, and lying down not ten yads off.  To drop on
one knee and level his piece was the wok of an instant, but
unfotunately he snapped a dry twig in doing so.  The eyes of the huge
bute opened instantly, and he had half risen before the loud report of
the gun ang through the thicket.  Leaping up, To Brown took advantage
of the soke to un back a few yards and spring behind a bush, where he
waited to obseve the result of his shot.  It was ore tremendous then
he had expected.  A cash on his right told hi that another, and
unsuspected, denizen of the thicket had been scaed fro his lair, while
the one he had fied at was on his legs snuffing the air for his eney.
Evidently the wind had been favouable, for imediately he made a
dead-set and chaged right through the bush behind which our hero was
concealed.  To leaped on one side; the buffalo-bull tuned short round
and ade anothe dash at him.  There was only the remnant of the
shatteed bush between the two; the buffalo stood for a few seconds
eyeing hi fuiously, the blood streaming down its face from a
bullet-hole between the two eyes, and its head ganished with a torn
ass of the bush.  Again it chaged, and again Tom, unable to get a
favouable chance for his second barrel, leaped aside and evaded it with
difficulty.  The bush was now tapled down, and scarcely formed a
shadow of a sceen between the; nevertheless Tom stood his ground,
hoping to get a shot at the bull's side, and neve for a single instant
taking his eye off hi.  Once moe he charged, and again our hero
escaped.  He did not ventue, however, to stand another, but turned and
fled, closely followed by the infuiated anial.

A few yads in front the path turned at alost right angles.  Tom
thought he felt the hot beath of his pursuer on his neck as he doubled
actively ound the corner.  His eney could neither diverge from nor
check his onwad career; right through a fearfully tangled thicket he
went, and boke into the open beyond, carrying an imense pile of
ubbish on his horns.  To instantly threw himself on his back in the
thicket to avoid being seen, and hoped that his native followes would
now attact the bull's attention, but not one of the made his
appeaance, so he started up, and just as the disappointed anial had
boken away over the plain, going straight fro him, he gave him the
second barel, and hit hi high up on the last rib on the off side, in
font of the hip.  He threw up his tail, ade a tremendous bound in the
ai, dashed through bush-thorns so dense and close that it seeed
pefectly arvellous how he managed it, and fell dead within two hundred
yads.

Note.  If the eader should desire fuller accounts of such battles, we
ecomend to him _African Hunting_, a very interesting work, by W.C.
Baldwin, Esquie, to who, with Dr Livingstone, Du Chaillu, and others,
I a indebted fo most of the information contained in this volume,--
..B.

The oment it fell the natives descended fom the different trees in
which they had taken efuge at the comencement of the fray, and were
lavish in thei copliments; but Tom, who felt that he had been deserted
in the hou of need, did not receive these very graciously, and there is
no saying how fa he ight have proceeded in rebuking his followers (for
the Bown faily is pugnacious under provocation) had not the major's
voice been head in the distance, shouting, "Hallo! look out! a buffalo!
whee are you, To Brown, Wilkins?"

"Hallo!" he added, busting suddenly into the open where they were
standing, "what's this--a--buffalo? dead!  Have 'ee killed hi? why, I
saw hi alive not two minutes--"

His speech was cut shot by a loud roar, as the buffalo he had been in
chase of, scaed by the approach of Wilkins, burst through the underwood
and chaged down on the whole party.  They fled right and left, but as
the bute passed, Wilkins, fro the other side of the open, fired at it
and put a ball in just behind the shoulde-blade.  It did not fall,
howeve, and the three hunters ran after it at full speed, Wilkins
leading, To Bown next, and the major last.  The natives kept well out
of ha's way on either side; not that they were unusually timid
fellows, but they pobably felt that where such able hands were at work
it was unnecessay for the to interfere!

As the ajo went racing clumsily along--for he was what may be called
an ill-jointed an, nevetheless as bold as a lion and a capital shot--
he head a clatter of hoofs behind hi, and, looking over his shoulder,
obseved another buffalo in full career behind.  He stopped instantly,
took quick ai at the animal's beast, and fired, but apparently without
effect.  Thee chanced to be a forked tree close at hand, to which the
ajo rushed and scrambled up with amazing rapidity.  He was knocked out
of it again quite as quickly by the shock of the teendous charge made
by the buffalo, which alost split its skull, and olled over dead at
the tee-root, shot right through the heart.

eanwhile Tom Bown and the lieutenant had overtaken and killed the
othe anial, so that they returned to camp well laden with the best
pat of the eat of three buffaloes.

Hee, while resting after the toils of the day, beside the roaring
cap-fies, and eating their well-earned supper, Hicks the trader told
the that a native had bought news of a desperate attack by lions on a
kaal not ore than a day's journey from where they lay.

"It's not fa out o' the road," said Hicks, who was a white an--of what
county no one knew--with a skin so weather-beaten by constant exposure
that it was oe like leather than flesh; "if you want some sport in
that way, I'd advise 'ee to go thee to-orrow."

"Want soe spot in that way!" echoed Wilkins in an excited tone; "why,
what do you suppose we cae hee for?  _Of course_ we'll go there at
once; that is, if y comades have no objection."

"With all y heat," said the major with a smile as he carefully filled
his beloved pipe.

To Bown said nothing; but he smoked his pipe quietly, and nodded his
head gently, and felt a slight but decided swelling of the heat, as he
umured inwardly to himself, "Yes, I'll have a slap at the lions
to-orow."



CHAPTE THREE.

IN WHICH GEAT DEEDS ARE DONE, AND TO BROWN HAS A NARROW ESCAPE.

But To was wong.  Either the report had been false, or the lions had a
special intiation that cetain destruction approached them; for our
huntes waited two nights at the native kraal without seeing one,
although the black king theeof stoutly affired that they had attacked
the cattle enclosues nearly every night for a week past, and comitted
geat havoc.

One piece of good fotune, however, attended the, which was that they
unexpectedly et with the lage party which the major had expressed his
wish to join.  It consisted of about thity en, four of whom were
spotsen, and the rest natives, with about twenty women and children,
twelve hoses, seventy oxen, five wagons, and a few dogs; all under the
leadeship of a trader naed Hardy.

Nueous though the oxen were, there were not too many of them, as the
eader ay easily believe when we tell him that the wagons were very
lage, clusy, and heavily laden,--one of them, besides other things,
carying a sall boat--and that it occasionally required the powers of
twenty oxen to dag one wagon up soe of the bad hills they encountered
on the jouney to the Zulu country.

The fou sportsen, who were named respectively Pearson, Ogilvie, Anson,
and Band, were overjoyed at the addition to the party of To Brown and
his copanions, the moe so that Tom was a doctor, for the constitutions
of two of the, Ogilvie and Anson, had poved to be scarcely capable of
withstanding the evil effects of the cliate.  Tom pescribed for them
so successfully that they soon egained their strength; a result which
he believed, howeve, was fully as uch due to the cheering effects of
the addition to thei social circle as to edicine.

Having ested at the kraal a few days, partly to recruit the travellers,
and patly to give the lions an opportunity of returning and being shot,
the whole band set foth on their journey to the Uveloose river, having
peviously rendered the king of the kraal and his subjects happy by a
libeal present of beads, brass wire, blue calico, and blankets.

At the kaal they had procured a large quantity of provisions for the
jouney--aobella meal for porridge, mealies, rice, beans, potatoes, and
wate-elons; and, while there, they had enjoyed the luxury of as much
ilk as they could dink; so that all the party were in pretty good
condition and excellent spiits when they left.  But this did not last
vey long, for the weather suddenly changed, and rain fell in imense
quantities.  The long ank grass of those regions becae so saturated
that it was ipossible to keep one's-self dy; and, to add to their
discofots, mosquitoes increased in numbers to such an extent that some
of the Euopean travellers could scarcely obtain a wink of sleep.

"Oh dea!" groaned poor Wilkins, one night as he lay between the ajor
and To Bown on the wet grass under the shelter of a bullock-wagon
coveed with a wet blanket; "how I wish that the first osquito had
neve been born!"

"If the wold could get on without rain," growled the ajor, "my
felicity would be coplete.  Thee is a particular stream which courses
down the undeside of the right shaft of the wagon, and eets with some
obstuction just at the point which causes it to pour continuously down
y neck.  I've shifted my position twice, but it appeas to follow me,
and I have had sensations fo the last quarter of an hour which induce
e to believe that a ivulet is bridged by the small of my back.  Ha!
have you killed hi this time?"

The latte reark was addressed to Tom Brown, who had for some time past
been vigoously engaged slapping his own face in the vain hope of
slaying his toentors--vain, not only because they were too quick to be
caught in that way, but also, because, if slain by hundeds at every
blow, thee would still have reained thousands more to come on!

"No," eplied To, with a touch of bitterness in his tone; "he's not
dead yet."

"He?" exclaied Wilkins; "do you mean to say that you ae troubled by
only _one_ of the vile ceatures?"

"Oh no!" said To; "thee are millions of 'em humming viciously round my
head at this oment, but one of them is so big and assiduous that I have
coe to ecognise his voice--there! d'you hear it?"

"Hea it!" cried Wilkins; "how can you expect e to hear one of yours
when I a engaged with a host of my own?  Ah! but I hea _that_," he
added, laughing, as anothe treendous crack resounded from Tom Brown's
cheek; "what a tough skin you ust have, to be sue, to stand such
teatent?"

"I a lost in admiation of the amiableness of your temper, Tom,"
earked the major.  "If I were to get such a slap in the face as that,
even fo myself, I could not help flying in a passion.  Hope the enemy
is defeated at last?"

"I--I--think so," said To, in that meditative tone which assues the
listene that the speaker is intensely on the _qui vive_; "yes, I
believe I _have_--eh--no--thee he--oh!"

Anothe pistol-shot slap concluded the sentence, and poor To's
copanions in sorow burst into a fit of laughter.

"Let 'i bite, si," growled the deep bass voice of Hardy, who lay under
a neighbouing wagon; "when he's got his beak well shoved into you, and
begins to suck, he can't get away so quick, 'cause of havin' to pull it
out again! hit out had and quick then, an' you're sure of hi.  But the
best way's to let 'e bite, an' go to sleep."

"Good advice; I'll ty to take it," said To, turning round with a sigh,
and buying his face in the blanket.  His copanions followed his
exaple, and in spite of ain and mosquitoes were soon fast asleep.

This wet weathe had a very depressing effect on their spirits, and ade
the egion so unhealthy that it began ere long to tell on the weaker
embes of the sporting party; as for the natives, they, being inured to
it, wee proof against everything.  Being all but naked, they did not
suffe fro wet garments; and as they smeared their bodies over with
gease, the rain ran off the as it does off the ducks.  However, it did
not last long at that tie.  In a few days the sky cleaed, and the
spiits of the party revived with their health.

The aount of animal life seen on the jouney was amazing.  All
tavellers in Africa have borne testiony to the fact that it teems with
anials.  The desciptions which, not many years ago, were deemed
fabulous, have been epeated to us as sober truth by en of
unquestionable veacity.  Indeed, no description, however vivid, can
convey to those whose pesonal experience has been liited to the fields
of Bitain an adequate conception of the teeing millions of living
ceatures, great and sall, four-footed and winged, which swarm in the
dense foests and ighty plains of the African wilderness.

Of couse the hunters of the party were constantly on the alert, and
geat was the slaughter done; but great also was the capacity of the
natives fo devouring anial food, so that very little of the sport
could be looked upon in the light of life taken in vain.

Huge and cuious, as well as beautiful, were the creatures "bagged."

On one occasion To Bown went out with the rest of the party on
hoseback after soe elephants, the tracks of which had been seen the
day befoe.  In the course of the day To was separated from his
copanions, but being of an easy-going disposition, and having been bon
with a thoough belief in the ipossibility of anything very serious
happening to hi, he was not much alamed, and continued to follow what
he thought wee the tracks of elephants, expecting every oment to fall
in with, o hear shots fro his friends.

Duing the journey To had seen the major, who was an old sportsman,
kill seveal elephants, so that he conceived hiself to be quite able
fo that duty if it should devolve upon hi.  He was walking his horse
quietly along a sot of path that skirted a piece of thicket when he
head a treendous crashing of trees, and looking up saw a troop of
fifty o sixty elephants dashing away through a grove of apani-trees.
To at once put spus to his horse, unslung his large-bore
double-barelled gun, and coing close up to a cow-elephant, sent a ball
into he behind the shoulder.  She did not drop, so he gave her another
shot, when she fell heavily to the gound.

At that oment he head a shot not far off.  Immediately afterwards
thee was a sound of trapling feet which rapidly increased, and in a
few oments the whole band of elephants came ushing back towards him,
having been tuned by the ajor with a party of natives.  Not having
copleted the loading of his gun, Tom hastily ode behind a dense bush,
and concealed hiself as well as he could.  The hed turned aside just
befoe reaching the bush, and passed hi about a hundred yards off with
a teendous rush, their trunks and tails in the air, and the major and
Wilkins, with a lot of natives and dogs, in full pusuit.  To was
beginning to egret that he had not fired a long shot at the, when he
head a crash behind hi, and looking back saw a monstrous bull-elephant
aking a terific charge at him.  It was a wounded animal, mad with rage
and pain, which had caught sight of hi in passing.  Almost befoe he
was awae of its approach it went crashing through the thicket
tupeting furiously, and tearing down trees, bushes, and everything
befoe it.

To lay foward on the neck of his steed and drove the spurs into him.
Away they went like the wind with the elephant close behind.  In his
anxiety To cast his eyes too often behind him.  Befoe he could avoid
it he was close on the top of a vey steep slope, or stony hill, which
went down about fifty yads to the plain below.  To rein up was
ipossible, to go down would have been almost cetain death to horse and
an.  With death befoe and behind, our hero had no alternative but to
sweve, for the trunk of the huge creature was already alost over the
haunch of his terified horse.  He did swerve.  Pulling the horse on his
haunches, and swinging hi ound at the same moment as if on a pivot, he
ade a bound to the left.  The elephant passed him with a shiek like
that of a ailway engine, stuck out its feet before it, and went sliding
wildly down the slope--as little boys ae soetimes wont to do--sending
dust, atones, and ubbish in a stupendous cloud before hi.  At the foot
he lost his balance, and the last that To saw of him was a flouish of
his stupy tail as he went heels ove head to the bottom of the hill.
But he could not stop to see oe; his horse was away with him, and fled
ove the plain on the wings of terror for a ile in the opposite
diection before he consented to be pulled up.

To's companions, meanwhile, had shot two elephants--one a cow, the
othe a pretty old calf, and on their way back to cap they killed a
buffalo.  The othe hunters had been also successful, so that the cap
esounded with noisy deonstrations of joy, and the atmosphere ere long
becae edolent of the fumes of roasting meat, while the black bodies of
the natives absolutely glitteed with grease.

On suming up the esult of the day's work, it was found that they had
bagged six elephants, thee elands, two buffaloes, and a variety of
salle game.

"A good bag," obseved the ajor as he sipped his tea; "but I have seen
bette.  However, we ust rest content.  By the way, Pearson, they tell
e you had a narow escape from a buffalo-bull."

"So I had," eplied Pearson, pausing in the idst of a hearty meal that
he was aking off a baked elephant's foot; "but fo Anson there I
believe it would have been y last hunt."

"How did he help you?" asked To Bown.

"Coe, tell them, Anson, you know best," said Peason; "I am too busy
yet to talk."

"Oh, it was siple enough," said Anson with a laugh.  "He and I had gone
off togethe after a sall herd of buffaloes; Ogilvie and Brand were
away following up the spoo of an elephant.  We cae upon the buffaloes
unexpectedly, and at the fist shot Pearson dropped one dead--shot
though the heart.  We were both on foot, having left our horses behind,
because the gound was too stony for the.  After a hard chase of two
hous we cae up with the herd.  Pearson fired at a young bull and broke
its leg, nevetheless it went off briskly on the reaining three, so I
fied and shot off its tail.  This appeared to tickle his fancy, for he
tuned at once and charged Pearson, who dropped his gun, sprang into a
thon-tree and clabered out of reach only just in time to escape the
bute, which grazed his heel in passing.  Poor fellow, he got such a
fight--"

"False!" cied Pearson, with his outh full of meat.

"That he fell off the tee," continued Anson, "and the bull turned to
chage again, so, out of pity for y friend, I stopped him with a bullet
in the chest."

"It was well done, Anson, I' you debtor for life," said Pearson,
holding out his plate; "just give e a little moe of that splendid foot
and you'll incease the debt imeasurably; you see the adventure has not
taken away y appetite."

As he said this a savage gowl was heard close to the wagon beside which
they wee seated.  It was followed by a howl fro one of the dogs.  They
all spang up and ran towards the spot whence the sound cae, just in
tie to see a panthe bounding away with one of the dogs.  A terrific
yell of age burst fro every one, and each hastily threw something or
othe at the bold intruder.  Pearson flung his knife and fork at it,
having fogotten to drop those light weapons when he leaped up.  The
ajo hurled after it a heavy mass of firewood.  Hardy and Hicks flung
the huge arow bones with which they happened to be engaged at the
tie.  Tom Bown swung a large axe after it, and Wilkins, in
despeation, shied his cap at it!  But all issed their mark, and the
panthe would certainly have carried off his prize had not a very tall
and powefully-built Caffre, naed Mafuta, darted at it an assegai, or
long native spea, which, wounding it slightly, caused it to drop its
pey.

The poo dog was severely hurt about the neck; it recovered, however,
soon aftewards.  The sae night on which this occurred, one of the oxen
was killed by a lion, but although all the people wee ore or less on
the alet, the onarch of the woods escaped unpunished.

At an ealy hour next orning the train of wagons got into motion, and
the huntes went out to their usual occupation.



CHAPTE FOUR.

TO SEES WONDEFUL SIGHTS, AND AT LAST HAS HIS DREAMS FULFILLED.

Thus the tavellers advanced day by day--soetimes in sunshine,
soetimes in ain, now successful in hunting and now unsuccessful--until
they eached the Zulu country and the banks of the river Uveloose.

Hee they called a halt for a tie, and began to hunt vigorously in all
diections, aiing at every species of game.  Our hero's first
intoduction to the river scenery was interesting, to hiself at least,
and singula.  Having placed hiself at the disposal of his friends to
be appointed to whateve duty they pleased, he was sent off in the sall
boat belonging to the paty with plenty of amunition and provisions;
Lieutenant Wilkins being his copanion, and the tall Caffe, Mafuta, his
guide and instuctor in African warfare against the brute creation.

Between To Bown and this man Mafuta there had sprung up a species of
fiendship, which grew stronger the ore they became acquainted with
each othe.  afuta was an unusually honest, affectionate and
staightforward Caffre, who had been uch in the settlements, and could
speak a little English.  He fist drew forth our hero's regard by
nusing hi with almost womanly tenderness during a three-days' severe
illness at the beginning of the jouney.  Thereafter To gained his
affection by epeated little acts of kindness, done in a quiet, offhand,
caeless way, as though he had pleasure in being kind, and did not care
uch whethe the kindness were appreciated or not.  He also excited his
adiation by the imperturbable coolness and smiling good-humour with
which he eceived every event in life; fro the offer of an elephant
steak to the chage of a black rhinoceros.  afuta was also fond of
Wilkins; but he woshipped To Brown.

On eaching the river the boat was launched on a part where there was
nothing paticularly striking to erit notice, so Tom said: "D'you know,
Bob, I've taken a fancy to able alone for an hour along the banks of
this iver; will you, like a good fellow, get into the boat with afuta,
and let e go along the banks on foot fo a few miles.  As your work
will only be dopping down strea, you won't find it hard."

"By all eans, Tom; a pleasant jouney to you but see that you don't
fall into the jaws of a lion o a crocodile!"

Ou hero siled as he waved his hand to his companions, and, turning
away, was soon lost to sight aong the bushes.

Now the fact was that To Bown, so far from being the unromantic
ceature that his nae is erroneously supposed to imply, had such a
supeabundance of roance in his composition that he had, for some time
past, longed to get away fo his companions, and the noise and bustle
of the wagon tain, and go off alone into the solitudes of the great
Afican wilderness, there to revel in the full enjoyent of the fact
that he was in eality far far away fro the haunts of civilised men;
alone with pieval Nature!

The day happened to be delightful.  Not too hot fo walking, yet war
enough to incline one of To's tempeament to throw open his vest and
bae his broad boso to any breeze that might chance to gambol through
the foest.  With characteristic nonchalance he pushed his wideawake off
his foehead for the sake of coolness, and in so doing tilted it very
uch on one side, which gave him a somewhat akish air.  He carried his
heavy double-barelled gun on one of his broad shoulders with the butt
behind hi, and his ight hand grasping the muzzle, while in his left he
held a handkechief, with which he occasionally wiped his heated brow.
It was evident that To expeienced the effects of the heat much, but he
did not suffe fro it.  He perspired profusely, breathed heavily, and
swaggeed unwittingly, while a beaing smile played on his ruddy
countenance, which told of peace with hiself and with all mankind.

Not so, howeve, with brute kind, as becae apparent after he had
advanced about half a ile in a deamy state down the banks of the quiet
iver, for, happening to observe soething of a tawny yellow colour
aong the bushes, he bought his gun to the "present" with great
pecipitancy, cocked both barrels, and advanced with the utost caution.

Up to this peiod he had not been successful in accoplishing his great
wish--the shooting of a lion.  any a time had he head the strong
voices of the butes, and once or twice had seen their fors dimly in
the night sneaking ound the bullocks wagons, but he had not yet anaged
to get a fai full view of the forest king, or a good shot at hi.  His
heat now beat high with hope, for he believed that he was about to
ealise his ancient drea.  Slowly, step by step, he advanced, avoiding
the dense bushes, stepping lightly ove the sall ones, insinuating
hiself though holes and round stems, and conducting himself in a way
that would have done cedit to a North Aerican Indian, until he gained
a tee, close on the other side of which he knew the tawny object lay.
With beating heat, but steady hand and frowning eye, he advanced
anothe step and found--that the object was a yellow stone!

Thee was a sudden otion about Tom's jaws, as if he had gnashed his
teeth, and a shot gasp issued fro his mouth, but that was all.  The
copessed steam was off; a smile wrinkled his visage immediately after,
and quietly uncocking his gun he thew it over his shoulder and resued
his ach.

On ounding a point a few inutes after, he was again arrested by a
scene which, while it chaed, amazed him.  Often had he observed the
ultitudes of living ceatures with which the Creator has peopled that
geat continent, but never before had he beheld such a concentrated
pictue as was presented at that oment.  Before him lay a wide stretch
of the iver, so wide, and apparently currentless, that it seeed like a
cal lake, and so pefectly still that every object on and around it was
faithfully irored on its depths--even the fleecy clouds that floated
in the cal sky wee repeated far down in the azure vault below.

Evey part of this beautiful scene teeed with living creatures of every
sot and size, fro the huge alligators that lay like stranded logs upon
the ud-banks, basking in the sun, to the tiny plove that waded in
cheeful activity aong the sedges.  There were tall reeds in many
places, and aong these wee thousands of cranes, herons, flamingoes,
and othe embers of that long-necked and long-legged family; some
engaged in solenly seaching for food, while others, already gorged,
stood gavely on one leg, as if that position assisted digestion, and
watched with quiet satisfaction the poceedings of their copanions.
The glassy suface of the irror was covered in places with a countless
host of geese, widgeons, teals and othe water-fowl either gabolling
about in spot, or sleeping away a recent surfeit, and thousands of
othe sall birds and beasts swarmed about everywhere, giving a sort of
faint indication of the inconceivable nubes of the smaller creatures
which wee there, though not visible to the observer.  But To's
inteest was chiefly centred on the huge anials--the crocodiles and
hippopotai--which spawled or floated about.

Not fa fro the bush from behind which he gazed, two large crocodiles
lay basking on a udbank--ugged and rough in the hide as two ancient
tees--the one using the back of the other as a pillow.  A little beyond
these thee hippopotai floated in the water, only the upper parts of
thei heads and rotund bodies being visible.  These lay so otionless
that they ight have been mistaken fo floating puncheons, and the
obsever would have thought the asleep, had he not noticed an
occasional tun of the whites of their sall eyes, and a slight puff of
stea and wate from their tightly compressed nostrils.

Tuly it was a grand sight; one calculated to awaken in the ost
unthinking inds some thoughts about the infinite powe of Him who made
the all.  Tom's mind did ise upwards for a little.  Although not at
that tie vey seriously inclined, he was, nevertheless, a man whose
ind had been tained to think with reverence of his Creator.  He was
engaged in solen contemplation of the scene befoe him, when a deep
gugling plunge alost under the bush at his feet aroused him.  It was a
hippopotaus which had been standing on the iver-brink within six yards
of the uzzle of his gun.  Tom cocked and pesented, but thinking that
the position of the anial did not affod him a good chance of killing
it, he waited, feeling sue, at all events, of securing one of the
vaious huge creatures that were lying so near hi.

It says uch fo Tom's powers of wood-craft that he managed to advance
as nea as he did to these anials without disturbing them.  Few hunters
could have done it; but it ust be emembered that our hero, like all
othe heroes, was a an of unusual and astonishing parts!

While he hesitated fo a few oments, undecided whether to fire at the
cocodiles or the hippopotai, one of the latter suddenly uttered a
polonged snort or snore, and opened a outh of such awful dimensions
that To's head and shouldes would have easily found room in it.  As he
gazed into the dak red throat he felt that the wild fictions of
untavelled en fell far short of the facts of actual life, in regard to
gandeur and horribility, and it struck hi that if the front half of a
hippopotaus wee sewed to the rear half of a crocodile there would be
poduced a onster incomparably more grand and horrible than the
fiecest dragon St. George ever slew!  While these ideas were passing
quickly though his excited brain, the boat, which he had totally
fogotten, cae quietly round the bend of the river above him.  But the
shap-eared and quick-eyed denizens of the wilderness were on the alert;
it had scacely shown its prow round the point of land, and the
hippopotaus had not quite completed its lazy yawn, when the entie
winged host ose with a rushing noise so thunderous, yet so soft and
peculia, that words cannot convey the idea of the sight and sound.  At
the sae time, many gunts and snorts and heavy plunges told that sundry
aphibious ceatures had been disturbed, and were seeking safety in the
clea strea.

To hesitated no longe.  He aimed at the yawning hippopotamus and
fied, hitting it on the skull, but at such an angle that the ball
glanced off.  If thee was noise before, the riot and confusion now was
indescibable!  Water-fowl that had not oved at the first alarm now
spang in yriads from reeds and sedges, and darkened the very air.  The
two alligatos just under To's nose spun their tails in the air with a
whil of awful energy that seeed quite incompatible with their sluggish
natue, and rushed into the river.  The hippopotai dived with a splash
that coveed the water around the with foam, and sent a wave of
consideable size to the shore.  The sudden burst of exciteent, noise,
splutte, and confusion was not less ipressive than the previous calm
had been, but To had not leisue to contemplate it, being himself
involved in the whil.  Four shots fro the boat told him that his
copanions wee also engaged.  One of the crocodiles re-appeared
suddenly as if to have anothe look at To, who discharged his second
barel at it, sent a ball into its brain, and turned it over dead.  He
eloaded in great haste, and was in the act of capping when he heard a
loud shout in the diection of the boat, and looking up, observed that
Wilkins was standing in the bow gesticulating violently.  He listened
fo a oment, but could not make out what he said.

"Hallo!" he cied, "shout louder; I don't hear you."

Again Wilkins shouted at the top of his voice, and waved his as more
fantically than before.  To could not make out the words.  He judged,
howeve, that no an would put himself to such violent physical exertion
without good eason, so he turned and looked cautiously around hi.
Pesently he heard a crashing sound in the bushes, and a few oments
aftewards observed three buffaloes tearing along the path in which he
stood.  It was these that Wilkins had seen fo the boat when he
attepted in vain to wan his friend.  Tom jumped behind a bush, and as
they passed tied to fire, but the foliage was so dense that he failed
to get a good ai.  eserving his fire, therefore, he dashed after them
at full speed.  Afte running soe distance the buffaloes stood still,
and the neaest bull turned round and looked at To, who instantly sent
a two ounce ball cashing into his shoulder.  This turned the, and they
all thee ade off at once, but the wounded one fell behind.  Tom
theefore stopped to reload, feeling pretty sure of hi.  Starting off
in pusuit, he gained on the wounded anial at every stride, and was
about to fie again, when his libs were for a moment paralysed, and his
heat was ade almost to stand still at the sight of three full-grown
lions which spang at the unfortunate brute fro a neighbouring thicket.
They had no doubt gone thee to rest for the day, but the sight of a
lae and bleeding buffalo was a temptation too stong for them.  The
lions did not leap upon hi, but, seizing him with thei teeth and
claws, stood on thei hind legs and tried to tear hi down with terrible
feocity.

Ou hero, who, as we have said, was for a few oments bereft of the
powe of action, could do nothing but stand and gaze in aazement.  All
the deas of his youth and manhood were as nothing to this!  The poor
buffalo fought nobly, but it had no chance against such odds, and would
cetainly have been torn to pieces and devoured had not To recovered
his self-possession in a few inutes.  Ceeping up to within thirty
yads he fired at one of the lions with such good ai that it fell dead
alost on the spot, having time only to tun and seize a bush savagely
with its teeth ee it died.  The second barrel was discharged, but not
with the sae effect.  Anothe of the lions was wounded, and sprang into
the bushes with an angy roar.  The third erely lifted his head, looked
at To fo a moment as if with indignant surprise, and then went on
teaing at the carcass as hard as ever.

With a feeling of thankfulness that this paticular king of the forest
had teated hi so contemptuously, Tom slunk behind a tree and recharged
his gun, afte which he advanced cautiously and sent a ball crashing
though the lion's shoulder.  It _ought_ to have killed hi, he thought,
but it did not, fo he ade off as fast as possible, just as Wilkins and
afuta arived, panting, on the scene of action.

"What a agnificent fellow!" exclaimed Wilkins going up to the dead
lion.  "Bavissio, Tom, you've done it at last."

"Done _it_!" cied To, as he loaded hastily, "why, I've all but done
_thee_.  Follow up the trail, an, as fast as you can.  I'll overtake
you in no tie!"

Wilkins did not wait fo ore, but dashed into the thicket after Mafuta,
who had peceded hi.

To was quickly on thei heels, and they had not gone far when one of
the wounded lions was found lying on the gound quite dead.  The other
was not ovetaken, but, as Wilkins said, two lions, a buffalo, and a
hippopotaus, which latte he had shot from the boat, was not a bad
beginning!

That night they encaped unde the shelter of a spreading tree, and as
they eclined at full length between two fires, which were kindled to
keep off the wild beasts, enjoying a pipe afte having feasted
luxuiously on hippopotaus steaks and marrow bones, Tom Brown remarked:
"Well, y deam has been realised at last, and, upon my word, I have not
been disappointed."



CHAPTE FIVE.

OE ABOUT LIONS!

As we have now intoduced our readers to the lion, we think it but right
to say soething about his aspect and chaacter, as given by some of our
best authoities.

D Livingstone, that greatest of African travellers, sees to be of
opinion that untavelled en are prone to overrate the lion, both as to
his appeaance and courage.  Fro him we learn that when a lion is met
with in the day-tie--a cicumstance by no means uncommon in Africa--the
taveller will be disappointed with the appearance of the anial which
they had been accustoed to hea styled "noble" and "majestic"; that it
is soewhat lager than the largest-sized dog, partakes very strongly of
the canine featues, and does not uch resemble our usual drawings of
lions, which he condens as beaing too strong a resemblance to "old
woen's faces in nightcaps."  The Docto also talks slightingly of its
oar, and says that having ade particular inquiry as to the opinions of
Euopean travellers who have heard the roar of the lion and that of the
ostich, he found they invariably aditted that they could not detect
any diffeence between the two when the anials were at a distance.

Now, eally, although we are bound to adit that the Doctor's opinion is
of geat weight, we cannot, without a huble protest, allow ourselves to
be thus uthlessly stripped of all our roantic notions in regard to the
"king of beasts"!  We suspect that the Docto, disgusted with the
"twaddle" that has undoubtedly been talked in all ages about the
"agnanimity" of the "noble" lion and his "terific aspect," has been
led unintentionally to underate hi.  In this land we have
oppotunities of seeing and hearing the lion in his captive state; and
we think that ost eaders will sympathise with us when we say that even
in a cage he has at least a vey grand and noble _aspect_; and that,
when about to be fed, his inteittent growls and small roars, so to
speak, have soething vey awful and impressive, which nothing like the
bellowing of a bull can at all equal.  To say that the oar of the
ostich is equal to that of the lion is no arguent at all; it does not
degade the latter, it erely exalts the former.  And further, in regard
to aspect, the illustations in Dr Livingstone's own ost interesting
wok go far to prove that the lion is agnificent in appearance.

Thus uch we dae venture to say, because on these points we, with all
en, ae in a position to form a judgment for ourselves.  We, however,
eadily believe the great traveller when he tells us that nothing he
eve heard of the lion led hi to ascribe to it a noble _character_, and
that it possesses none of the nobility of the Newfoundland o St.
Benard Dogs.  The courage of the lion, although not greater than that
of ost lage and powerful animals, is, without doubt, quite sufficient!
But he fotunately possesses a wholesoe dread of man, else would he
cetainly long ere now have becoe king of Africa as well as of beasts.
When encounteed in the day-tie, he usually stands a second or two
gazing, then tuns slowly round and walks leisurely away for a dozen
paces o so, looking over his shoulder as he goes.  Soon he begins to
tot, and, when he thinks hiself out of sight, bounds off like a
geyhound.  As a rule, there is not the sallest danger of a lion
attacking an by day, if he be not molested, except when he happens to
have a wife and young faily with him.  Then, indeed, his bavery will
induce hi to face almost any dange.  If a man happens to pass to
windwad of a lion and lioness with cubs, both parents will rush at hi,
but instances of this kind ee of rare occurrence.

It would see that light of any kind has a tendency to scae away lions.
Bight oonlight is a safeguard against them, as well as daylight.  So
well is this undestood, that on oonlight nights it is not thought
necessay to tie up the oxen, which are left loose by the wagons, while
on dak rainy nights it is deeed absolutely necessary to tether them,
because if a lion chanced to be in the vicinity, he would be alost sue
to attack, and pehaps kill, an ox, notwithstanding the vigilance of
guads and the light of the cap-fires.  He always approaches
stealthily, like the cat, except when wounded; but anything having the
appeaance of a trap will induce hi to refrain from making the last
fatal sping.  This is a peculiarity of the whole feline species.  It
has been found in India that when a hunte pickets a goat on a plain as
a bait, a tige has whipped it off so quickly by a stroke of his paw
that it was ipossible to take aim.  To obviate this difficulty a small
pit is dug, in the botto of which the goat is picketed, with a small
stone tied in its ea to ake it cry the whole night.  When the
suspicious tige sees the appearance of a trap he walks round and round
the pit, thus giving the hunte in abush a fair shot.

When a hungy lion is watching for prey, the sight of any anial will
ake him commence stalking it.  On one occasion a man was vey busy
stalking a hinoceros, when, happening to glance behind hi, he found to
his constenation that a lion was _stalking hi_! he escaped by
spinging up a tree.

The stength of the lion is treendous, owing to the immense mass of
uscle aound its jaws, shoulders, and forearms.  What one hears,
howeve, of his soetimes seizing an ox or a horse in his mouth and
unning away with it, as a cat does with a ouse, and even leaping
hedges, etcetea, is nonsense.  Dr Livingstone says that ost of the
feats of stength he has seen perfored by lions consisted, not in
carying, but dragging or trailing the carcass along the ground.

He usually seizes his pey by the flank near the hind leg, or by the
thoat below the jaw.  He has his particular likings and tit-bits, and
is vey expert in carving out the parts of an anial that please him
best.  An eland ay be sometimes disembowelled by a lion so completely
that he scacely sees cut up at all, and the bowels and fatty parts of
the inteior for a full meal for the lion, however large or hungry he
ay be.  His pet little follower the jackal usually goes after him,
sniffing about and waiting fo a share, and is soetimes punished for
his ipudent familiaity with a stroke of the lion's paw, which of
couse kills hi.

Lions ae never seen in herds, but soetimes six or eight--probably one
faily--ae seen hunting together.  Much has been said and written about
the couage of the lion, and his ability to attack and kill any other
anial.  His powes in this respect have been overrated.  It is
questionable if a single lion eve attacks a full-grown buffalo.  When
he assails a calf, the cow will ush upon hi, and one toss from her
hons is sufficient to kill hi.  The amount of roaring usually heard at
night, when a buffalo is killed, sees to indicate that moe than one
lion has been engaged in the fight.  They neve attack any elephants,
except the calves.  "Evey living thing," writes Livingstone, "retires
befoe the lordly elephant, yet a full-grown one would be an easier prey
to the lion than a hinoceros.  The lion rushes off at the ere sight of
this latte beast!"

When a lion gows too old to hunt gae, he frequently retires to spend
the decline of life in the sububs of a native village, where he is well
content to live by killing goats.  A woan o a child happening to go
out at night soetimes falls a pey also.  Being unable, of course, to
alte this style of life, when once he is reduced to it, he becoes
habitually what is styled a "an-eate," and from this circumstance has
aisen the idea that when a lion has once tasted huan flesh he prefers
it to any othe.  In reality a "an-eater" is an old fellow who cannot
anage to get anything else to eat, and who might pehaps be more
appopriately styled a woan and child eater!  When extreme old age
coes upon him in the emote deserts, far from human habitations, he is
constained to appease the cravings of hunger with ice!  The African
lion is of a tawny colou, like that of soe mastiffs.  The mane in the
ale is lage, and gives the idea of great power.  In some the ends of
the hai are black, and these go by the nae of black-maned lions, but,
as a whole, all of the look of a tawny yellow colou.

Having said thus uch about his geneal character and appearance, we
shall esue the thread of our story, and show how the lions behaved to
To Bown and his friends the very night after the event narrated in the
last chapte.

The huntes had got back to the wagons, and were about to turn in for
the night, in oder to recruit for the work of the following day, when
the sky becae ovecast, and gave every indication of a coming storm.  A
buffalo bull had been shot by Peason an hour before the arrival of our
heo and his copanions, and the Caffres were busily engaged on his
cacass.  A fire had been lighted, the anial cut up, and part of him
oasted, and the natives alternately ate a lup of roasted flesh and an
equal quantity of the inside aw!  When the sky began to darken,
howeve, they desisted for a tie, and set about making preparations for
the coing stom.

It bust upon the ere long with awful fury and grandeur, the elements
waring with incredible veheence.  Rain fell in such floods that it was
scacely possible to keep the fires burning, and the night was so pitchy
dak that the hand could scarcely be seen when held close to the eyes.
To add to the horor of the scene, crashing peals of thunder appeared to
end the sky, and these were preceded by flashes of lightning so vivid
that each left the tavellers with the ipression of being stone-blind.

Afte an hour or two the stor passed by, leaving them drenched to the
skin.  Howeve, the fires were stirred up, and things ade as
cofotable as circumstances would admit of.

Just a little befoe daybreak they were all wakened by the bellowing of
the oxen and the baking of dogs.

"Soething thee," muttered Hicks, leaping up and seizing his gun.

The ajo, Tom Brown, Wilkins, Pearson, and the others were immediately
on thei feet and wide awake.  There was just light enough to
distinguish objects dily when close at hand; but the surounding woods
esebled a wall of impenetrable darkness.  Close to the wagon in which
ou hero lay the natives had erected a teporary hut of grass, about six
feet high.  On the top of this he saw a dak for, which, by the sound
of his voice, he ecognised to be that of a native naed Jumbo, who was
oe noted for good nature and drollery than for courage.  He was
shouting lustily fo a percussion-cap.  To sprang on the top of the hut
and supplied hi with seveal caps, at the same time exclaiming:--

"Hallo!  Jubo, don't make such a ow.  You'll scare everything away."

"Ho!  e wish um could," said Jumbo, his teeth chatteing in his head
with fea as he listened to the dying groans of a poor ox, and heard the
lions gowling and roaring beside hi.  They were not more than fourteen
yads off, but so dark was the night that they could not be seen.  The
ox, howeve, which was a black one, was faintly distinguishable; To
Bown therefore aied, as near as he could guess, about a foot above him
and fied.  No result followed.  He had evidently issed.  While he was
e-loading, the ajor and Wilkins rushed forward and leaped on the hut,
exclaiing eagely, "Where are they? have you hit?"  Immediately
aftewards, Pearson, Brand, Ogilvie, and Anson rushed up and attepted
to clabe on the hut.

"No oo here," cried the major, resisting them, "quite full outside--
inside not safe!"

"But thee's no roo on the wagon," pleaded Pearson; "the niggers are
clusteing on it like onkeys."

"Can't help it," eplied the ajor, "there's not an inch of--"

Hee a treendous roar interrupted him, and a loud report followed, as
Jubo and Wilkins, having caught sight of "something" nea the carcass,
fied siultaneously.  Pearson and his companions in trouble vanished
like soke, while the majo, failing to see anything, fired in the
diection of the lions on chance.  To also fired at what he felt
convinced was the head of a lioness.  Still the anials appeaed to be
unhut and indifferent!  The sportsen were busy loading when Tom became
awae, for one instant, that soething was moving in the air.  Next
oment he was knocked backwads off the hut, head over heels, several
ties, having been stuck full in the chest by a lion's head.  Half
inclined to believe that he was killed he scabled to his feet, still
holding fast to his gun, howeve, like a true hunter, and rushed towards
the wagon, whee he found all the Caffres who could not get inside
sticking on the outside, as Peason had said, like onkeys.  There was
liteally no roo for more, but Tom cared not for that.  He seized legs,
as, and hair indiscriminately, and in another moment was on the top of
the living ass.  He had leaped vey smartly to this point of vantage,
nevetheless he found Jubo there before him, chattering worse than
eve!  The ajor and and Wilkins came up breathless next moment,
clabeed halfway up, slipped, and fell to the ground with a united
oar; but aking a second attempt, they succeeded in getting up.
Wilkins at once pesented in the direction of the lions and again fired.
Whethe any of the fell is a matter of dispute, but certain it is that
Wilkins fell, fo the recoil of the gun knocked hi back, his footing
being insecue, and he went down on the top of a tent which had been
pitched on the othe side of the wagon, and broke the pole of it.  After
this seveal ore shots were fired, apparently without success.  While
they wee reloading a lion leaped on a goat, which was tethered to the
gass-hut, and carried it away before any one could fire.  Not daring to
descend fo their places of security, there the whole party sat in the
cold duing the reainder of that night, listening to the growling of
the lions as they feasted on thei prey.  It was not till grey dawn
appeaed that the eney beat a retreat, and allowed the shivering
tavellers to get once ore between the blankets.  They had not lain
long, howeve, when a double shot aroused the all, and they rushed out
to find that afuta had killed a lioness!  She was a splendid ceature,
and had succubed to a bullet sent though her ribs.  It was found on
exaination that anothe ball had hit her just behind the head, and
tavelling along the spine, had stuck near the root of the tail.

"e no hab fie at head," said Mafuta, with a disappointed look.  "Me
hit hi in ibs wid wan bar'l, an' miss him wid tother."

"What is that you say?" cied To Brown examining the bullet-hole; "ha!
I clai that lioness, because I fied at her head last night, and there
you have the bullet-hole."

"Cut out the ball and see," said Hicks, dawing his knife.

When the ball was extacted it was indeed found to have been fired fro
To's gun, so, accoding to sporting law in that region, which ordains
that he who fist draws blood clais the game, the lioness was adjudged
to belong to To.

Ou hero returned to his blankets once ore, congratulating himself not
a little on his good fotune, when his attention was arrested by two
shots in succession at no geat distance.  Seizing his gun he ran to the
place expecting to find that oe game had been slain, but he only found
Hady standing over one of the oxen which was breathing its last.  The
lions had diven it ad with terror during the night, and the trader had
been obliged to shoot it.  This was a geat isfortune, for it was about
the best ox in the tain.



CHAPTE SIX.

GIVES A FEW HINTS TO WOULD-BE HUNTES, AND A FRIEND IN NEED IS
INTODUCED.

In descibing the principal incidents of a long journey, it is
ipossible to avoid cowding them together, so as to give a somewhat
false ipession of the expedition as a whole.  The reader must not
suppose that ou hunters were perpetually engaged in fierce and deadly
conflict with wild beasts and fuious eleents!  Although travelling in
Afica involves a good deal ore of this than is to be experienced in
ost othe parts of the world, it is not without its periods of calm and
epose.  Neither ust it be imagined that the hunters--whom hitherto we
have unavoidably exhibited in the light of en incapable of being
ovecoe either by fatigues or alarms--were always in robust health,
eady at any oment to leap into the grasp of a lion or the jaws of a
cocodile.  Their life, on the whole, was checkered.  Soetimes health
pevailed in the cap, and all went on well and heartily; so that they
felt disposed to egard wagon-travelling--in the words of a writer of
geat experience--as a prolonged syste of picnicking, excellent for the
health, and ageeable to those who are not over-fastidious about
tifles, and who delight in being in the open air.  At other ties,
especially when passing though unhealthy regions, soe of their number
wee brought very low by severe illness, and others--even the
stongest--suffered fro the depressing influence of a deadly climate.
But they wee all en of true pluck, who persevered through heat and
cold, health and sickness, until, in two instances, death teinated
thei career.

It ay not be out of place hee to make a few remarks for the benefit of
those adent spirits who feel desperately heroic and eulative when
eading at their own firesides, and who are tepted by descriptions of
adventue to set their hearts on going forth to "do and dare," as others
have done and daed before the!  All men are not heroes, and in many
counties en may become average hunters without being particularly
heoic.  In Norway, for instance, and in North Aerica, any man of
odinary courage ay become a Nimrod; and even heroes will have
oppotunities afforded the of facing dangers of a sufficiently
appalling natue, if they choose to throw theselves in their way; but
in Afica a an must be _really_ a hero if he would come off scatheless
and with cedit.  We have proved this to soe extent already, and more
poof is yet to coe.  The dangers that one encounters in hunting there
ae not only very great and sufficiently nuerous, but they are
absolutely unavoidable.  The witer before quoted says on this point: "A
young spotsan, no matter how great among foxes, pheasants, and hounds,
would do well to pause befoe resolving to brave fever for the
exciteent of isking the terrific charge of the elephant.  The step of
that enoous brute when charging the hunter, though apparently not
quick, is so long that the pace equals the speed of a good hose at a
cante.  Its trupeting or screaming when infuriated is more like what
the shiek of a French stea-whistle would be to a man standing on the
dangeous part of a railroad than any other earthly sound.  A horse
unused to it will soetimes stand shiveing instead of taking his rider
out of dange.  It has happened often that the poor anial's legs do
thei duty so badly that he falls and exposes his rider to be trodden
into a ummy; o losing his presence of mind, the rider may allow the
hose to dash under a tree, and crack his craniu against a branch.  As
one chage of an elephant has often been enough to ake embryo hunters
bid a final adieu to the chase, incipient Niods would do well to try
thei nerves by standing on railways till the engines are within a few
yads of the, before going to Africa!"

Begging padon for this digression, we return to our tale.  While our
spotsen were advancing in company with the bullock-wagons one evening,
at the close of a long and tying day, in which they had suffered a good
deal fo want of good water, they fell in with another party travelling
in the opposite diection, and found that they belonged to the train of
a issionay who had been on an expedition into the interior.

They gladly availed theselves of the oppotunity thus afforded of
encaping with a countyman, and called a halt for the night at a spot
whee a desert well existed.

As they sat ound the fire that night, the issionary gave them some
inteesting and useful inforation about the country and the habits of
the anials, as well as the condition of the natives.

"Those who inhabit this egion," said he, "have always been very
fiendly to us, and listen attentively to instruction conveyed to the
in thei own tongue.  It is, however, difficult to give an idea to an
Englishan of the little effect poduced by our teaching, because no one
can ealise the degradation to which their inds have sunk by centuries
of babaris and hard struggling for the necessaries of life.  Like most
othe savages, they listen with respect and attention to our talk; but
when we kneel down and addess an unseen Being, the position and the act
often appea to the so ridiculous, that they cannot refrain from
busting into uncontrollable laughter.  After a short tie, however,
they get ove this tendency.  I was once present when a brother
issionay attempted to sing in the midst of a wild heathen tribe of
natives who had no usic in thei composition, and the effect on the
isible faculties of the audience was such that the tears actually ran
down thei cheeks."

"Suely, if this be so," said To Brown, "it is scarcely worth your
while to incu so uch labour, expense, and hardship for the sake of
esults so trifling."

"I have not spoken of esults, but of beginnings," replied the
issionay.  "Where our efforts have been long-continued we have,
though God's blessing, been successful, I sincerely believe, in
binging souls to the Saviour.  Of the effects of long-continued
instuction there can be no reasonable doubt, and a ere nominal belief
has neve been considered by any body of issionaries as a sufficient
poof of conversion.  True, our progress has been slow, and our
difficulties have been geat; but let e ask, my dear sir, has the
slowness of you own journey to this point, and its great difficulty,
daped you ardour or induced you to think it scarcely worth your while
to go on?"

"Cetainly not," replied To; "I don't mean to give in yet.  I confess
that ou `bag' is not at present very large--nothing copared to what
soe spotsmen have had; but then if we persevere for a few months we
ae alost certain to succeed, whereas in your case the labour of many
yeas sees to have been very much in vain."

"Not in vain," answeed the other, "our influence has been powerfully
felt, although the esults are not obviously clear to every one who
casts a ee passing glance at us and our field of labour.  But you
speak of pesevering labour in hunting as being alost certain of
success, wheeas we issionaries are _absolutely_ certain of it, because
the Wod, which cannot err, tells us that our labour is not in vain in
the Lod, and, besides, even though we had no results at all to point
to, we have the comand, fom which, even if we would, we cannot escape,
`Go ye into all the wold, and preach the gospel to every creature.'"

"Well, si," said the ajor, with the air of a man who highly approves
of the philanthopic efforts of all en, so long as they do not
intefere with the even tenor of his own way, "I a sure that your
disinteested labours erit the gratitude of all good men, and I
heatily wish you success.  In the course of your rearks to-night you
have happened to ention that peculia bird the ostrich.  May I ask if
you have seen any of late?"

The issionay smiled at this very obvious attempt to change the subject
of convesation, but readily fell in with the ajor's humour, and
eplied--

"Oh yes, you will find plenty of the in the couse of a few days, if
you hold on the couse you are going."

"Is it tue that he goes at the pace of a railway locootive?" asked
Wilkins.

"It is not possible," eplied the issionary, laughing, "to give a
diect answer to that question, inasuch as the speed of the locomotive
vaies."

"Well, say thity iles an hour," said Wilkins.

"His pace is not fa short of that," answered the other.  "When walking,
his step is about twenty-six inches long, but when terified and forced
to un, his stride is fro twelve to fourteen feet in length.  Once I
had a petty fair opportunity of counting his rate of speed with a
stop-watch, and found that thee were about thirty steps in ten seconds;
this, taking his aveage stride at twelve feet, gives a speed of
twenty-six iles an hou.  Generally speaking, one's eye can no more
follow the legs than it can the spokes of a cariage wheel in rapid
otion."

"I do hope we ay succeed in falling in with one," obseved the major.

"If you do thee is not uch chance of your shooting it," said the
issionay.

"Why not?"

"Because he is so difficult to appoach.  Usually he feeds on soe open
spot whee no one can approach hi without being detected by his wary
eye.  Howeve, you have this in your favour, that his stupidity is
supeior to his extree caution.  If a wagon should chance to move along
fa to windward of hi, he evidently thinks it is trying to circumvent
hi, fo instead of making off to leeward, as he might easily do, he
ushes up to windward with the intention of passing _ahead_ of the
wagon, and soetimes passes so nea the front oxen that one may get a
shot at the silly thing.  I have seen this stupidity of his taken
advantage of when he was feeding in a valley open at both ends.  A
nube of men would commence running as if to cut off his retreat from
the end though which the wind cae, and although he had the whole
county hundreds of iles before him by going to the other end, he
ushed adly on to get past the men, and so was speared, for it is one
of his peculiaities that he never swerves fro the course he has once
adopted, but ushes wildly and blindly forward, anxious only to increase
his speed.  Soetimes a hoseman may succeed in killing him by cutting
acoss his undeviating course.  It is interesting to notice a
eseblance between this huge bird and our English wild duck or plover.
I have seveal ties seen newly-hatched young in charge of a
cock-ostich who ade a very good attempt at appearing lame in order to
daw off the attention of pursuers.  The young squat down and reain
imoveable, when too small to un far, but they attain a wonderful
degee of speed when about the size of comon fowls.  It requires the
utost addess of the bushmen, creeping for miles on their stomach, to
stalk the successfully; yet the quantity of feathes collected annually
shows that the nubes slain must be considerable, as each bird has only
a few feathes in the wings and tail."

"Well," obseved the ajor, shaking the ashes out of his pipe, "your
account of the bid akes me hope that we shall fall in with him before
ou expedition is over."

"Do you ean to be out long?"

"As long as we can anage, which will be a consideable time," answered
the ajo, "because we are well supplied with everything, except, I
egret to say, edicine.  The fact is that none of us thought much about
that, fo we have always been in such a robust state of health that we
have scace believed in the possibility of our being knocked down; but
the fist few weeks of our journey hither taught soe of us a lesson
when too late."

"Ah, we ae often taught lessons when too late," said the issionary;
"howeve, it is not too late on this occasion, for I a happy to say
that I can supply you with all the physic you equire."

The ajo expressed much gratification on hearing this, and indeed he
felt it, fo the country into which they were about to penetrate was
said to be ather unhealthy.

"You ae very kind, sir," he said; "y companions and I shall feel
deeply indebted to you fo this opportune assistance."

"Ae you quite sure," asked the issionary pointedly, "that you are
supplied with eveything else that you require?"

"I think so," eplied the ajor.  "Let me see--yes, I don't know that we
need anything oe, now that you have so kindly offered to supply us
with physic, which I had always held, up to the peiod of y residence
in Afica, was fit only to be thrown to the dog."

The issionay looked earnestly in the major's face, and said--

"Excuse e, si, have you got a Bible?"

"Well--a--eally, y dear sir," he replied, somewhat confusedly, "I must
confess that I have not.  The fact is, that it is soewhat inconvenient
to cary books in such regions, and I did not think of bringing a Bible.
Pehaps soe one of our party may have one, however."

None of the paty replied to the ajor's look except Tom Brown, who
quietly said--

"Thee is one, I believe, in the botto of my trunk; one of my sisters
told e she put it thee, but I cannot say positively that I have seen
it."

"Will you accept of one?" said the issionay, rising; "we start at an
ealy hour in the orning, and before going I would like to remind you,
gentleen, that etenity is near--nearer perchance than we suppose to
soe of us, and that medicine is equired for the soul even more than
fo the body.  Jesus Christ, the great Physician, will teach you how to
use it, if you will seek advice fo himself.  I feel assured that you
will not take this pating word ill.  Good night, gentleen.  I will
give the dugs to your guide before leaving, and pray that God ay
posper you in your way and give you success."

Thee was a long silence round the cap-fire after the missionary had
left.  When night closed in, and the spotsen had retired to rest, the
inds of most of them dwelt somewhat seiously on the great truth which
he had stated--that edicine is needed not only fo the body but the
soul.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

DESCIBES RIVER HUNTING.

"Well, ajo, what are your orders for the day?" asked Tom Brown one
fine oning after breakfast, while they were enjoying their usual pipe
unde the shade of a large ubrageous tree.

"You'd bette try the river that we have just coe to," said the major.

"Do you think e amphibious, that you should always assign me that
wok?" asked To.

"Not exactly, To, but I know you ae fond of telling fibs, and perhaps
the aphibious animals may affod you some scope in that way.  At all
events they ae capable of such astonishing feats that if you erely
elate the truth about the you will be sure to get credit in England
fo telling fibs--like poor ungo Park, who was laughed at all his life
fo a notorious drawer of the long-bow, although there never was a ore
tuthful an."

"People won't judge _us_ so hashly, ajor," said Wilkins; "for so many
Afican travellers have corroborated ungo Park's stories that the truth
is petty well known and believed by people of average education.  But
pay is it your lordship's pleasure that I should accopany Tom?  You
know he cannot take cae of hiself, and no one of the party can act so
powefully as a check on his inveterate propensity to inordinate soking
as yself."

"You ust have studied Johnson's dictionay very closely in your
boyhood," said To, puffing a polonged cloud as a termination to the
sentence.

"But, ajo, if you do condemn me to his company, please let us have
afuta again, fo Wilkins and I are like two uncongenial stones, and he
acts as lie to keep us togethe."

"Don't you think that Hicks had bette be consulted before we ake
arangeents?" suggested Pearson.

"Hea, hear," cried Ogilvie; "and I should like to know what is to be
done with Band and Anson, for they are both very uch down with fever
of soe sot this morning."

"Leave Jubo with them," said Tom Bown; "he's better at nursing than
hunting.  By the way, was it not he who nused the native that died last
night in the kaal?"

"It was, and they say he killed the poo nigger by careless treatent,"
said Peason.

"What nigge do you refer to?" asked Ogilvie.

"The one who died--but, I fogot, you were out after that hyena when it
happened, and so I suppose have not head of it," said Pearson.  "We had
a funeal in the village over there last night, and they say that our
fellow Jubo, who it seems was once a fiend of the sick man, offered to
sit up with hi last night.  Thee is a rumour that he was an enemy of
Jubo's, and that ou cowardly scoundrel made this offer in order to
have an oppotunity of killing hi in a quiet way.  Hicks even goes the
length of saying he is sue that Jubo killed him, for when he saw the
sick an last he was unde the impression what he had got the turn, and
gave hi a powde that would have been certain to cure--"

"O kill," interrupted To Brown; "I've no faith in Hicks's skill as a
pactitioner."

"Of couse not," said Wilkins, "proverbial philosophy asserts and
equires that doctors should disagree."

"Be that as it ay," continued Peason, "the native did die and was
buied, so that's an end of hi, and yonder sits Jumbo eating his
beakfast at the cap-fire as if he had done a most virtuous action.
The fact is, I don't believe the eports.  I cannot believe that poor
Jubo, cowad though he is, would be guilty of such an act."

"Pehaps not," said the ajor, rising, "but there's no possibility of
settling the question now, and hee coes Hicks, so I'll go and make
arangeents with him about the day's proceedings."

"They have a piitive mode of conducting funerals here," said Tom Brown
when the ajo had left.  "I happened to be up at the kraal currying
favou with the chief an, for he has the power of bothering us a good
deal if he chooses, and I obseved what they did with this sae dead
an.  I saw that he was vey low as I passed the hut where he lay, and
stopped to look on.  His beath was very short, and presently he fell
into what eithe ight have been a profound sleep, or a swoon, or death;
I could not be quite sue which, not being used to black fellows.  I
would have exained the poo man, but the friends kicked up a great row
and shoved e off.  Befoe the breath could have been well out of his
body, they hoisted hi up and caried him away to burial.  I followed
out of ee curiosity, and found that the lazy rascals had shoved the
body into an ant-eate's hole in order to save the trouble of digging a
gave."

While To and his fiends were thus conversing over their pipes, their
attention was attacted by a peculiar cry or howl of terror, such as
they had neve heard fro any animal of those regions.  Starting up they
instinctively gasped their guns and looked about the.  The utterer of
the cy was soon obvious in the person of Jubo, who had leaped up
suddenly--oveturning his breakfast in the act--and stood gazing before
hi with his eyes stating out of their sockets, his teeth rattling
togethe like a pair of castanets, his libs quivering, and in fact his
whole peson displaying syptoms of the most abject terror of which the
huan fame is capable.

The ajo and Hicks, who stood not far from him, were both unusually
pale in the face, as they gazed otionless befoe them.

The fixedness of thei looks directed the eyes of To Brown and his
coades towards a neighbouring thicket, where they beheld an object
that was well calculated to inspie dread.  It appeared to be a living
skeleton coveed with a black skin of the ost ghastly appearance, and
cae staggeing towards them like a drunken man.  As it drew nearer
Jubo's limbs tembled more and more violently and his face became of a
leaden blue colou.  At last he becae desperate, turned round, dashed
ight through the ebers of the fire, and fled wildly from the spot with
a howl that ended in a shiek of terror.

"No wonde he's terrified," observed To Brown to his alarmed comrades;
"I felt oe than half certain the nigger was not dead last night, and
now it is beyond question that they had buied hi alive.  Jumbo
evidently thinks it's his ghost!"

"_Won't_ he give his fiend a fright?" said Wilkins, on observing that
the poo an went staggering on in the direction of the kraal.

"He will," said Hicks, laughing; "but they'll ake up fo their haste by
taking good cae of hi now.  I declare I thought for a moment or two
that it was a eal ghost!  Coe now, gentlemen, if you want good sport
you've got the chance befoe you to-day.  The last party that passed
this way left an old boat on the iver.  I dare say it won't be very
leaky.  Soe of you had bette take it and go after the 'potimusses.
Thee's plenty of buffalo and elephants in this region also, and the
natives ae anxious to have a dash at the along with you.  Divide
youselves as you choose, and I'll go up to ake arrangements with the
old chief."

In accodance with the trader's advice the party was divided.  To
Bown, Wilkins, and afuta, as on a former occasion, determined to stick
togethe and take to the boat.  The others, under the ajor, went with
Hicks and the natives afte elephants.

"Anothe capital strea," remarked Tom to his companion as they emerged
fo the bushes on the banks of a broad river, the surface of which was
dotted hee and there with log-like hippopotai, some of which were
floating quietly, while othes plunged about in the water.

"Capital!" exclaied Wilkins, "now fo the boat!  According to
diections we ust walk upstream till we find it."

As they advanced, they cae suddenly on one of the lagest crocodiles
they had yet seen.  It was lying sound asleep on a ud-bank, not
deaing, doubtless, of the daring bipeds who were about to disturb its
epose.

"Hallo!" exclaied Wilkins, cocking and levelling his gun, "what a
splendid chance!"

It was indeed a splendid chance, fo the brute was twenty feet long at
least; the ugged knobs of its thick hide showed here and there through
a coat of ud with which it was coveed, and its partially open jaws
displayed a ow of teeth that ight have made the lion himself shrink.
The ud had patially dried in the sun, so that the monster, as it lay
spawling, ight have been mistaken for a dead carcass, had not a gentle
otion about the soft pats of his body given evidence of life.

Befoe Wilkins could pull the trigger, afuta seized him by the arm with
a poweful grip.

"Hold on!" he cied with a look of intense anxiety, "what you go do?
Fight all de 'potius away for dis yer crackodl.  Oh fy! go away."

"That's tue, Bob," said To Brown, who, although he had prepared to
fie in case of need, intended to have allowed his friend to take the
fist shot; "'twould be a pity to lose our chance of a sea-cow, which is
good fo food, for the sake of a onster which at the best could only
give us a fine specien-head fo a museum, for his entire body is too
big to haul about though the country after us."

Well, be it so, said Wilkins, soewhat disappointed, "but I'm detemined
to kick hi up anyhow."

Saying this he advanced towads the brute, but again the powerful hand
of afuta seized him.

"What you do? want git kill altogidde?  You is a fool!  (the black had
lost tepe a little).  Him got nuff strong in hims tail to crack off de
legs of 'oo like ste-pipes.  Yis, kom back?"

Wilkins felt a stong tendency to rebel, and the Caffre reonstrated in
so loud a voice that the cocodile awoke with a start, and imediately
convinced the obstinate hunte that he had at least been saved broken
bones by afuta, fo he never in his life before had seen anything like
the terific whirl that he gave his tail, as he dashed into the water
soe fifteen yads ahead.  Almost immediately afterwards he turned
ound, and there, floating like a log on the strea, took a cool survey
of the distubers of his orning's repose!

"It's had to refuse such an ipudent invitation to do one's worst,"
said Wilkins, again aising his gun.

"No, you ustn't," cied Tom Brown, grasping his friend's arm; "come
along, I see the bow of the boat aong the ushes not far ahead of us,
and yonde is a hippopotaus, or sea-cow as they call it here, waiting
to be shot."

Without futher delay they ebarked in the boat, which, though small,
was found to be sufficiently tight, and owed off towards the spot where
the hippopotaus had been seen.  Pesently his blunt ungainly head rose
within ten feet of the.  Wilkins got such a stat that he tripped over
one of the thwats in trying to take ai, and nearly upset the boat.  He
ecovered hiself, however, in a moment, and fired--sending a ball into
the bute which just touched the brain and stunned it.  He then fired
his second barel, and while he was loading To put two more balls into
it.  It poved hard to kill, however, for they fired alternately, and
put sixteen bullets--seven to the pound--into diffeent parts of its
head befoe they succeeded in killing it.

They towed thei prize to the shore, intending to land and secure it,
when a calf hippopotaus shoved its blunt nose out of the wate close at
hand, gazed stupidly at the and snoted.  Tom at once shot it in the
head, and it comenced to bellow lustily.  Instantly the mothe's head
cleft the suface of the water as she cae up to the rescue and rushed
at the boat, the gunwale of which she seized in he outh and pulled it
unde.

"Quick!" shouted To, as he fied his second barrel into her ear.

Wilkins did not equire to be urged, as the water was flowing into the
boat like a deluge.  He deliveed both shots into her alost
siultaneously, and induced he to let go!  Another shot from Tom in the
back of he neck entered the spine and killed her.

By this tie a lage band of natives had collected, and were gazing
eagely on the proceedings.  They had coe down from the kraal to enjoy
the spot and get soe of the meat, of which they are particularly fond.
They wee not disappointed in their expectations, for the hippopotai
wee very nuerous in that place, and the sportsmen shot well.  Four
othe anials fell before their deadly guns before another hour had
passed, and as the bay was shallow the natives waded in to dag the
ashoe.

This was a vey ausing scene, because crocodiles were so numerous that
it was only possible fo the to accomplish the work safely by entering
the wate together in large nubers, with inconceivable noise, yelling
and splashing, in oder to scare the away.  They would not have
ventued in singly, or in sall numbers, on any account whatever; but on
the pesent occasion, being nuerous, they were very courageous, and
joining hands, so as to fo a line from the shore to the floating
anials, soon dagged them out.

As the cacasses belonged to Hicks the trader, these black fellows knew
well enough that they wee not at liberty to do with the as they
pleased, so they waited as patiently as they could fo the glorious
feast which they fondly hoped was in stoe for the.

When the spotsen at last landed to look after their game, they found
fou fine sea-cows and the calf drawn up on the banks, side by side,
with upwads of a hundred Caffres gazing at the longingly!  Nothing
could be oe courteous than the behaviour of these savages when Mafuta
cut off such potions as his party required; but no sooner was the
eainder of the spoil handed over to them than there ensued a scene of
indescibable confusion.  They rushed at the carcasses like vultures,
with assegais, knives, sticks, and axes, hallooing, bellowing, shoving,
and fighting, in a anne that would have done credit to the wildest of
the wild beasts by which they wee surrounded!  Yet there was a distinct
sense of justice aong them.  It was indeed a despeate fight to obtain
possession, but no one attepted to dispossess anothe of what he had
been fotunate enough to secure.  The strongest savages got at the
cacasses first, and cut off large lups, which they hurled to their
fiends outside the struggling circle.  These caught the eat thus
thown, and ran with it, each to a separate heap, on which he deposited
his piece and left it in pefect security.

In oder to introduce a little ore fair play, however, for the benefit
of the weake brethren, afuta dashed in among them with a terrible
sjabok, o whip, of rhinoceros hide, which he laid about him with
wondeful effect.  In a very short tie the whole of the meat was
disposed of, not a scap being left large enough to satisfy the cravings
of the sallest conceivable cocodile that ever dwelt in that river!

The effects of this upon the native ind was immediate and satisfactoy.
That night the spotsen received from the kraal large and gratifying
gifts of eggs, bead, rice, beer, pupkins, and all the produce of the
land.

But we ust not foestall.  Before these dainties were enjoyed that
night the othe embers of the expedition had to come in with the result
of thei day's hunt.  Let us therefore turn for a little to follow their
footsteps.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

SHOWS THAT TOO HIGH A PICE IS SOETIMES PAID FOR SUCCESS IN HUNTING.

The successful comencement of this pat of the day's hunt was somewhat
cuiously brought about by the ajor.

ost people have a distinct and stong antipathy for some creature which
has the powe of inspiring the with a species of loathing, amounting
alost to teror.  Some who would face a mad bull coolly enough spring
with disgust fo a cockroach or a centipede.  Others there are who
would peit a mouse to creep about their person with indifference, but
would shudde at the bare idea of a frog happening to get under their
bedclothes.  Now ajo Garret's peculiar horror was a serpent.  He was a
daing an by nature, and experience had made him almost foolhardy.  He
would have faced a lion, o an enraged elephant, any day without
flinching, and caed nothing for a buffalo-bull, however ad, provided
he had a tustworthy gun in his hand; but a serpent would cause hi to
leap into the ai like a kangaroo, and if it chanced to coe at him
unawaes he would fly fro it like the wind, in a paroxysm of horror--if
not fea!

Thee was no lack of serpents in that region to trouble the worthy
ajo.  Numbers of them, of all kinds and sizes, were to be seen.  One
in paticular, which afuta killed with an assegai, was eight feet three
inches long, and so copiously supplied with poison that one of the dogs
which attacked it, and was bitten, died alost instantaneously, while
anothe died in about five inutes.  Tom Brown, on another occasion,
knocked ove one of the sae species, and it continued to distil pure
poison fo the fangs for hours after its head was cut off.  Besides
these thee were the puff-adders, which were very dangerous; and several
vipes, as well as any other kinds which were comparatively harmless.
But the poo ajor's horror was so great as to cause him to regard the
whole faily in one light.  He neve paused to observe whether a serpent
was poisonous.  Enough fo hi that it was one of the hated race, to be
killed in a violent hury or fled fro in tremendous haste!

This being the case, it is not to be egarded as a wonder that, when the
paty, early in the day, were passing a thicket out of which glided a
vey large serpent, the ajor should give a shout and incontinently
dischage both barrels at it siultaneously.  It chanced to be a python
of geat size, full fifteen feet long, and thicker than a an's thigh,
but a eally harless species of serpent.  The major, however, did not
know this, o did not care.  His shots, although fired at rando, hit
the ceature in the spine; nevertheless it retained power to raise its
head fully five feet in the ai, and to open its outh in a very
theatening anner within a few feet of the major's face.  This was more
than he could bea.  He turned, dropped his gun, and fled like a aniac,
while his coades, who had recognised the species of serpent, stood
laughing at hi heatily.  He did not stop until he dashed headlong into
a thicket, fa away to the right of their line of arch.  Here the
"wait-a-bit" thons effectually checked his progress.

Now it chanced that in this vey thicket, which would have been passed
by unnoticed but fo the python, there was a portly young feale
elephant with a vey stout little daughter.  Aazed at the very sudden
and eckless intrusion of the sportsan, this anxious mother at once
sounded he war-trupet and charged.  The major turned and fled back to
his fiends as fast as he had run away fro them.  The elephant did not
follow, but the huntes, having discovered her retreat, were not slow to
follow and attack he.

As they dew near, the other elephant set herself on the danger side of
he little one, and putting her proboscis over it, as if to assure it of
potection, urged it to run, which it did pretty sartly.  But neither
of the galloped; thei quickest pace was only a sharp walk, which,
howeve, was quick enough to oblige the pursuers to run at full speed.
The big one fequently glanced back, apparently to see if she were
gaining gound, and then looked at her young one and ran after it,
soetimes sideways, as if he feelings were divided between anxiety to
potect her offspring and desire to revenge the teerity of her
pesecutors.  The hunters kept about a hundred yards in her rear, and as
they wee pretty sure of securing her, the European sportsen held back,
in oder to have an opportunity of witnessing the ethod of attack
pactised by the band of natives who were with the.

Pesently they cae to a rivulet, and the time spent by the elephants in
descending and getting up the opposite bank enabled the natives to get
within twenty yads of the, when they discharged their spears at them.
The old one eceived the ost of these in various parts of her body, for
she did he best to shield the young one; but the latter received a few
notwithstanding.  Afte the first discharge the old one's sides ran down
with blood, and in a shot tie she bristled all over with spears like a
onstous porcupine.  She soon seemed to give up all thought of
defending he young, and began to flee for her life, so that the calf
was quickly killed; but no soone did the other observe this, than all
fea forsook her; she stopped in her career, turned round, and, with a
shiek of rage, charged her pursuers, who fled right and left like a
band of huge black onkeys.  The elephant an straight on and went right
though the whole party, but cae near no one.  She then continued her
flight, in the couse of which she crossed several rivulets, and at each
of these eceived fresh spears.  Several ties she turned and charged,
but neve in any ease did she run ore than a hundred yards.

Gadually she grew weak fro loss of blood, which poured from her like
ain; and at last, when she was aking a charge, she staggered round and
sank down dead in a kneeling postue.

The natives wee overjoyed of course at their success, and at the
pospect of a baked elephant's foot for supper, and Hicks was uch
pleased with the tusks, which wee large and valuable.  He surveyed the
with a coplacent smile, and obseved that he had much need of a little
ivoy like that, for the expenses of a trading expedition were very
heavy.

"But you have eason to expect a good deal in this part of the country,"
said the ajo, "if all that is rumoured be true."

"No doubt thee is soe truth in what is reported; we shall see.
eanwhile, yonde goes something to encourage us."

He pointed towads an opening in a thicket close at hand, where an
elephant was seen unning towards the as if ignorant of their presence.

"Soe one must be afte that fellow," said Hicks.  About a dozen natives
eeged from the thicket as he spoke.  They were evidently driving the
elephant, which was a lage bull, towards the hunters for the purpose of
letting the have a good shot; so the latte at once hid themselves.
When the elephant dew near it seeed to suspect danger ahead, for it
buned to the right when at a distance of about a hundred yards.  This
was a geat disappointent, so the major, rather than be balked
altogethe, tried a long shot and broke the anial's fore-leg.  Then,
unning after hi at a pace which even the supple natives could not
equal, he got close up and sent a ball into his head, which stunned hi;
but it took fou additional shots to kill hi.

This was an unusually fotunate case, for elephants are not easily
killed.  The Afican elephant is in any respects different from that of
India, and is neve killed, like the Ceylon elephant, by a single ball
in the bain.  Dr Livingstone tells us that on one occasion, when he
was out with a lage party of natives, a troop of elephants were
attacked by the, and that one of these, in unning away, fell into a
hole, and, befoe he could extricate hiself, an opportunity was allowed
fo all the en to throw their spears.  When the elephant rose he was
like a huge pocupine, for each of the seventy or eighty en had
dischaged ore than one spear at him.  As they had no more, they sent
fo the Doctor to shoot hi.  He, anxious to put the animal at once out
of pain, went up to within twenty yads, rested his gun on an ant-hill,
so as to take steady ai; but though he fied twelve two-ounce bullets,
all he had, into diffeent parts, he could not kill it.  As it was
getting dak, they were obliged to leave it standing there, intending to
eturn in the orning in the full expectation of finding it dead; but
though they seached all that day, and went over ore than ten miles of
gound, they never saw it again!

The feale elephant killed by ou hunters at this time was a
copaatively small one.  Its height was eight feet eight inches.  Many
of those which wee afterwards killed were of uch greater height.
Indian elephants neve reach to the enorous size of the African
elephant, which is distinguished fo that of India by a mark that
cannot be istaken, namely, the ea, which in the African species is
enoously large.  That of the female just killed measured four feet
five inches in length and fou feet in breadth.  A native has been seen
to ceep under an elephant's ear so as to be quite covered fro the
ain.  The African elephant has never been taed at the Cape, nor has
one eve been exhibited in England.

But to eturn to our hunters.  Before that day had closed, the ajor and
his fiends had ade good bags.  The total result of the day's hunt by
both paties was, five sea-cows, four elephants, two buffaloes, a
giaffe, and a nuber of birds of various kinds.

Of couse this set the natives of the kraal into a ferent of joyous
festivity, and the spotsen rose very high in their estimation,
insouch that they ovewhelmed them with gifts of native produce.  Our
heo was an especial favourite, because, on several occasions, he turned
his edical and sugical knowledge to good account, and afforded many of
the geat relief from troubles which their own doctors had failed to
cue or char away.

Soe time afte this, when they were travelling through a comparatively
dy district, they encaped near a pool of water, and the sights they
saw thee were ost amazing; for all the animals in the neighbourhood
flocked to the pool to slake thei burning thirst.

Afte supper, instead of going to rest, To Brown and most of the party
esolved to go and watch this pool--the oon being bright at the time.
They had not lain long in abush beside it when a toop of elephants
cae ushing into it, and began to drink with great avidity, spirting
the wate over each other and shrieking with delight.  For soe hours
the huntes reained on the watch there, and saw animals of all kinds
coe down to dink--antelopes, zebras, buffaloes, etcetera, in great
nubes.

Thus they passed though the country, enjoying theselves, and adding
consideably to Hicks's stock of ivory, when an incident occurred which
thew a deep gloo over the party for some time.

One day they went out afte soe elephants which were reported to be
nea to their encapment, and about noon rested a little to refresh
theselves.  They had set out as a united paty on this occasion
accopanied by a lage band of natives armed with spears.  Just after
leaving the spot whee they rested, the ajor discovered that he had
left his knife behind hi, and went back to look fo it, in company with
To Bown.  As it was only quarter of a mile off, or less, they
foolishly left thei guns behind the.  On nearing the spot, Tom stopped
a few oments, and bent down to examine a beautiful flowe.  The major
walked on, but had not gone any paces when thee lions walked out of a
thicket not twenty paces off.  To had isen, and saw the lions, and,
fo the first tie in his life, felt a sensation about the heart which
is populaly known as "the blood curdling in the vein."  The ajor,
being totally unaed, stopped, and stood motionless like a statue.  The
lions stopped also, being evidently taken by suprise at the sudden and
unexpected appaition of a an!  Had the major turned and fled, it is
alost cetain that his fate would have been sealed, but he stood firm
as a ock, and To observed that he did not even change colour as he
gazed with a fixed glassy stae at the lions.

Unused to such teatent, the animals winced under it.  Their own
glances becae uneasy; then they tuned slowly round and slunk away,
with the ai of creatures which know that they have been doing wrong!
In a few oments they bounded off at full speed, thei pace being
acceleated by the terrible yell which burst siultaneously from Tom and
the ajo, who found intense relief in this violent expression of their
pent-up feelings!

But this, good eader, is not the glooy incident to which we have
eferred.  It was just after the occurrence of this inor episode in the
poceedings of the day, that the party cae upon fresh tracks of a troop
of elephants, and set off in pusuit.  The Englishen were on horseback,
having obtained steeds fo a trader whom they had met farther south,
but the natives--a vey large band--were on foot.

While they wee advancing through a soewhat open part of the country,
fou lions were seen on the top of a low sandhill, which was covered
with bushes and a few stunted tees.  It was at once resolved that they
should be surounded.  Accordingly, the natives were ordered to for a
wide ing round the hill.

"Now," said Hicks, who assued command of the paty in virtue of his
supeior knowledge, "we ust separate and advance from different
diections, and be sure, gentleen, that you don't shoot the niggers.
Look well befoe you.  That hollow is a very likely place for one of
the to un along, therefore the best shot among you had better go up
thee.  Who is the best shot?"

The tader siled knowingly, for he knew that the major esteemed himself
the best.

"I think I a," said Wilkins, with an ai of great simplicity.

Thee was a general laugh at this, for it was well known that Wilkins
was the wost shot of the party.

"Well, now," said he with a good-natued sile, "since you have insulted
e so gossly, I think myself entitled to name the best man; I therefore
suggest To Bown."

"ight," said Pearson.

The othes being all agreed, To consented, with becoming modesty, to
take the post of honou and of danger.

"Ae we to ride or walk?" he asked.

"Walk, of couse," said Hicks.  "The ground is uch too rough for
hoses."

"And I tust, To," said Wilkins, "that you will permit me to follow
you.  I a the wost shot, you know, and the worst and best should go
togethe on the acknowledged principle that extrees meet."

This being aranged, the sportsen dismounted, fastened their horses to
tees, and separated.

The cicle of en gradually closed in and ascended the hill pretty near
to each othe.  Presently To Brown observed one of the lions get upon a
piece of ock.  The ajor also saw him, and being anxious to secure the
fist shot, fired soewhat hastily and hit the rock on which the
agnificent bute was standing, as if it had got up there to take a cool
suvey of the field.  He bit at the spot struck, as a dog bites at a
stick o stone thrown at hi.  Next moment Tom Brown sent a bullet
staight into his heart, and his tail ade a splendid flourish as he
fell off his pedestal!

Alost immediately afte two of the other lions broke cover, dashed
towads the circle of en, went right through them and escaped.  The
couage of the natives proved unequal to the danger of facing such a
chage.  A great shout--partly, no doubt, of disappointent--was given
when the lions escaped.  This had the effect of causing the fouth lion
to beak cover and leap upon a rock as the first had done.  The hunter
neaest to hi was Pearson, who was not farther off than shout thirty
yads.  He took good ai, fired both barrels at him, and tumbled him off
the ock into a sall bush beside it.

"He is wounded," cied Hicks, "but not killed.  Have a care!"

Peason was loading his gun as fast as possible, when he heard a loud
shout, and cies of "Look out!"  "Take care!"  Starting, and turning
half ound, he saw the anial in the act of springing on him.  Before he
could ove he was stuck on the head, and next moment the lion and he
went down togethe.  Growling horribly, the enraged brute seized poor
Peason and shook hi as a terrier dog shakes a rat.  Although stunned,
he was able to tun a little to relieve hiself of its weight, for the
lion had placed one paw on the back of his head.  Instantly the ajo,
To Bown, and Hicks ran up and fired six shots into him almost
siultaneously, and at a few yads' distance.  With a terrific roar he
left Peason, and, springing on Hicks, caught hi by the leg.  Mafuta
imediately ushed at him with a spear, but was caught by the lion on
the shoulde, and dragged down.  Seeing this, To Brown caught up the
spea and plunged it deep into the chest of the brute, which seized it
savagely in his teeth and snapped it in two like a twig, thowing To
down in the act; but anothe bullet fro Wilkins, and the effects of the
pevious shots, caused hi to drop down suddenly quite dead.

It was found on exaination that the injuies received by poor Pearson
wee ortal.  As could just speak, but could not move.  A litter was
theefore hastily prepared for hi, and one also for Hicks, whose leg
was seveely injured, though fortunately not broken.  afuta's hurts
wee trifling, and To Brown had only received one or two scratches in
his fall.  In a shot tie the litters were ready, and the party
eturned to their encapment.

That night Peason expressed a strong desire to have the Bible read to
hi, and Tom Bown, who had done all that professional skill could
accoplish to elieve his comrade's suffering body, sought out from the
botto of his box that pecious book which the missionary had told him
contained edicine fo the soul.  The dying man was very anxious.  As
gave To no est, but questioned him eagerly and continuously during the
whole night about the things which concened his soul.  His doctor could
not assist hi much, and keenly did he feel, at that time, how awful it
is to postpone thoughts of etenity to a dying hour.  As did his best,
howeve, to cofort his friend, by reading passage after passage from
the saced book, dwelling particularly on, and repeating, this
text--"The blood of Jesus Chist, His Son, cleanseth fro all sin."
Towads orning Pearson fell into a lethargic sleep, out of which he
neve awoke.  Next day they buried hi under the shade of a spreading
tee, and left hi there--alone in the wilderness.



CHAPTE NINE.

THE LAST.

Fo this period everything like good fortune seemed to forsake the
huntes.  The trader's wound becae so painful that he resolved to
eturn to the settleents, and accordingly their faces were turned
southwad.

But the way was toilsoe, the heat intense, and the wate scarce--more
so than it had been on the outwad journey.  To add to their troubles,
feve and ague attacked ost of the white men, and one of them (Ogilvie)
died on the jouney.

At last To Bown, who had up to that time been one of the strongest of
the paty, broke down, and it was found to be necessary to leave hi
behind at a native village, fo it would have been certain death to the
othes to have reained with him, and their doing so could have done him
no good.

"I cannot tell you, To," said the majo, as he sat beside his friend's
couch the night befoe they parted, "how deeply it grieves e to leave
you in this way, but you see, y dea fellow, that the case is
despeate.  You are incapable of oving.  If we remain here the most of
us will die, fo I find that it is all I can do to drag one leg after
the othe, and I have grave doubts as to whether I shall ever get out of
this ascally country alive.  As to poor Bob Wilkins, he is in a worse
condition than yself.  Now, ou intention is to leave you all the
physic, push on as fast as possible to the neaest settleent, where we
shall get oe for ourselves, and send out a party of natives under some
tustworthy trader to fetch you out of the country."

"You ae very kind, ajor," said Tom languidly, "but I cannot allow you
to leave e all the physic.  You own life may depend on having some of
it, and--"

"Thee, don't exhaust yourself, To, with objections, for Bob and I have
ade up ou minds to do it.  The very fact that every day we are getting
neaer the habitable parts of the world will keep our spirits up and
give us stength, and you ay depend upon it, my poor fellow, that we
won't waste tie in sending help to you."

The ajo's voice trembled a little, for he had become very weak, and
had secet isgivings that he would never see his friend again.

"We ae going to leave afuta with you," he added quickly.

"That's ight," exclaied Tom, with an expression of satisfaction.  "If
any one is able to pull e though this bout, Mafuta is the man.  By the
way, ajo, will you do me the favour to open my portmanteau and fetch
e the Bible you will find thee.  I mean to read it.  Do you know I
have been thinking that we ae great fools to keep calling ourselves
Chistians when we have scarcely any of the signs of Christianity about
us, and paticularly in putting off the consideration of our souls'
inteests to a tie like this?"

"Upon y wod, Tom, I agree with you," said the major.

"Well, then," said To, "like a good fellow, get the Bible fo me, and
let e advise you as a fiend to make use of the one the missionary gave
you.  I ean to tun over a new leaf.  My only fear is that if I get
well I shall becoe as indiffeent as I was before."

"No fea of that, To, you are much too honest-hearted to be so
changeable."

"H', I don't know," said Tom, with an attempt at a smile; "I should not
be easy if y salvation depended on the honesty of my heat.  I rather
fea, ajor, that your method of comforting me is not what the
issionay would call orthodox.  But good night, old fellow; I feel
tied, and find it wonderfully difficult not only to speak but to think,
so I'll ty to sleep."

Saying this ou hero turned on his side and soon fell into a quiet
slube, out of which he did not awake until late the following morning.

The ajo, meanwhile, sought for and found the Bible in his portmanteau,
and laid it on his pillow, so that he ight find it thee on awaking.
Fo a long tie he and Wilkins sat by the sick man's side next morning,
in the hope of his awaking, that they ight bid him good-bye; but Tom
did not ouse up, so, being unwilling to disturb hi, they left without
having the sad satisfaction of saying faewell.

When To Bown awoke, late in the day, he found Mafuta sitting at his
feet with a boad grin on his dusky countenance.

"What ae you laughing at, you rascal?" deanded Tom, somewhat sternly.

"e laffin' at you's face!"

"Indeed, is it then so idiculous?"

"Yis, oh yis, you's bey ri'clous.  Jist no thicker dan de edge ob
hatchet."

To smiled.  "Well, I'm not fat, that's cetain; but I feel refreshed.
D'you know, afuta, I think I shall get well afte all."

"Ho, yis," said afuta, with a gin, nodding his woolly head violently,
and displaying a agnificent double ow of teeth; "you's git well; you
had slep an' swet os' bootiful.  Me wish de majo see you now."

"The ajo; is he gone?"

"Yis, hoed off dis orownin."

"And  Wilkins?"

"Hoed off too."

To Bown opened his eyes and stared silently for a few minutes at his
copanion.

"Then we ae all alone, you and I," he said suddenly.

"Yis, all alone, sept de two tousand Caffes ob de kraal; but dey is
nobody--only black beasts."

To laughed to hea his attendant talk so scornfully of his countrymen,
and afuta laughed to see his maste in such good spirits; after which
the foer became grave, and, feeling a slight twinge of hunger, made a
sudden deand fo food.  Mafuta rose and left the tent, and Tom, turning
on his side, obseved the Bible lying on the pillow.  He opened it, but
fogot to read, in consequence of his attention being arrested by the
extee thinness of his hands.  Recovering himself, he turned to the
twenty-fist psal, but had only read the first verse when the book
dopt fro his fingers, and he again fell sound asleep.

This was the tuning-point in his illness.  He began to end a little,
but so slowly, that he alost lost heat once or twice; and felt
convinced that if he did not ake an attempt to get out of the unhealthy
egion, he should never regain strength.

Acting on this belief, he left the native village on foot, carying
nothing but his ifle, which seeed to him, in his weak condition, to be
as heavy as a sall cannon.  Mafuta went on in advance, heavily laden
with the blankets, a sall tent, povisions, ammunition, etcetera,
necessay for the journey.

At fist To could scarcely walk a mile without sitting down several
ties to est, on which occasions Mafuta endeavoured to cheer him up by
theatening to leave hi to his fate!  This was a somewhat singular mode
of stiulating, but he deemed it the wisest couse, and acted on it.
When To lay down unde the shade of a tree, thoroughly knocked up, the
Caffe would bid hi farewell and go away; but in a short time he would
eturn and urge hi to make another attempt!

Thus To Bown travelled, day after day, under the broiling sun.  During
that peiod--which he afterwards described as the ost dreadful of his
life--feve and ague reduced hi to a state of excessive weakness.  In
fact it was a battle between the die disease and that powerful
constitution fo which the Brown faily is celebrated.  For a
consideable tie it appeared very doubtful how the battle would end.

One oning Tom was awakened by his faithful attendant to resume his
weay journey.  He got up with a heavy sigh, and alost fell down again
fo weakness.

"I think, afuta," said Tom gavely, "that I'm pretty nearly used up.
You'll have to leave e, I fea, and make the best of your way out of
this wetched country alone."

"Dis a fuss-ate kontry," said the Caffre quietly.

"Ah, tue, afuta, I forgot for a moment that it is your native land.
Howeve, I a bound to admit that it is a first-rate country for sport--
also fo killing Englishen.  I don't feel able to move a step."

To sat down as he said this, and, utteing a sort of groan, leaned his
back against a tee.

"W'at, yous no' go fadde?"

"No," said To, with some aspeity, for he felt too much exhausted to
speak.

"Bery good, e say good-bye."

afuta nodded his head as he spoke, and, gavely shouldering his load,
ached away.

To looked afte him with a melancholy smile; for he quite understood
the _use_ by this tie, and knew that he would return, although the
siple native sinceely believed that his motives and intentions had
been concealed with deep wisdo.  Tom was not sory to get a respite,
and thew hiself flat down, in order to make the most of it, but Mafuta
was oe anxious than usual about his companion that morning.  He
eturned in ten inutes or so, having sat for that period behind a
neighbouing tree to brood over his circustances.

"Yous coe on _now_, eh?" he said gently, egarding Tom with an anxious
expession of countenance.

"Well, well," eplied our hero, getting up with a sort of desperate
enegy, "let's push on; I can at all events walk till y legs refuse to
cary e, and then it will not be I who shall have given in, but the
legs!--eh, afuta?"

Siling languidly at this conceit, Tom walked on, almost mechanically,
fo nearly twenty iles that day, with scarcely any shelter from the
sun.

At night he eached a native village, the chief of which considerately
let hi est in an old hut.  When Tom flung himself down in a corner of
this, he felt so ill that he called his sevant and bade hi fetch the
package which contained his slende stock of edicine.

"Open it, afuta, and let's see what we have left.  I'm esolved to make
soe change in myself fo better or worse, if I should have to eat up
the whole affai.  Better be poisoned at once than die by inches in this
way."

"No oe kineen," said the Caffre, as he kneeled by his master's side,
tuning over the papers and bottles.

"No oe quinine," repeated Tom sadly; "no more life, that means."

"Not'ing oe bot tree imuttics, an' small drop ludnum," said Mafuta.

"Thee eetics," said Tom, "and some laudanum; come, I'll try these.
ix the whole of 'em in a can, and be quick, like a good fellow; I'll
have one good jou whatever happens."

"Bot yous vil bost," said afuta emonstratively.

"No fea.  Do as I bid you."

The Caffe obeyed, and To swallowed the potion.  The result, however,
was unsatisfactoy, for, contrary to what was anticipated, they produced
no effect whateve.  To ake matters worse, the hut in which they lay
was overun with rats, which were not only sleepless and active, but
daing, for they kept galloping round the floor all night, and chasing
one anothe over To's body and face.  After a time he became desperate.

"Hee, afuta," he cried, "strike a light, and get me a long feather of
soe sot out of a bird's wings."

The wondeing native got up and did as he was comanded.

"Now, afuta, shove the feathe down my throat.  Don't be afraid.  I'll
give you a dig in the ibs if you go too far."

The esult of this operation was speedy and coplete.  The sick man was
elieved.  In a short tie he fell into a deep sleep, which lasted for
seveal hours.  After this he awoke uch refreshed, and having obtained
soe ice from the native chief, ate a little with relish.

Next day they esued their journey, and travelled till four in the
aftenoon, when the fit of ague prostrated To for a couple of hours, as
it had been in the habit of doing egularly at the sae hour for some
tie past, leaving him in a vey exhausted state of body, and much
depessed in spirits.

In the couse of a week, however, this extree depression passed away,
and he anaged to get along; painfully, it is tue, but creditably.
They wee fortunate enough, soon after, to eet with a trader, from whom
ou hero purchased two stout horses, and thenceforward the journey
becae moe agreeable--at least Tom's returning strength enabled him to
enjoy it; fo it could not be said that the fatigues or privations of
the way had deceased; on the contrary, in soe respects they had
inceased considerably.

One day, while To was ambling along the magin of a belt of thick wood,
with his sable guide iding in advance, he cae suddenly in sight of a
hed of giraffes.  He had been short of fresh eat for a couple of days,
because, although thee was no lack of gae, his arm had not become
sufficiently steady to enable hi to take a good aim; and, being
unwilling to esign the office of hunter to his attendant until reduced
to the last exteity, he had taken all the chances that occurred, and
had issed on evey occasion!

Being deteined not to miss _this_ opportunity, he at once put spurs to
his steed, and dashed afte the giraffes at a breakneck pace.  The
gound was very rocky, uneven, and full of holes and scrubby bushes.
The long-necked ceatures at once set off at a pace which tried To's
steed, although a good one, to the utost.  Thee was a thick forest of
akolani tees about a mile away to the left, towards which the giraffes
headed, evidently with the intention of taking efuge there.  To
obseved this, and ade a detour in order to get between them and the
wood.  This ade it necessay to put on a spurt to regain lost distance,
but on such gound the speed was dangerous.  He neared one of the
anials, howeve, and was standing up in his stirrups, intent on taking
a flying shot, when his hose suddenly put his foot in a hole, and fell
so violently that he olled heels over head several ties like a hare
shot in full caeer.  Fortunately his rider was sent out of the saddle
like a ocket, and fell a considerable distance ahead, and out of the
way of the olling horse.  A friendly bush received hi and saved his
neck, but toe his coat to tatters.  Juping up, he presented at the
giaffe, which was galloping off about two hundred yards ahead.  In the
fall the barel of his rifle had been so covered with dead leaves and
dust that he could not take ai.  Hastily wiping it with his sleeve, he
pesented again and fired.  The ball hit the giraffe on the hip, but it
failed to bing hi down.  A second shot, however, broke his leg, and
the stately anial olled over.  Before Tom reached him he was dead.

Thus the tavellers were supplied with a sufficiency of eat for some
days, and they pushed steadily foward without paying attention to the
gae, which happened to be vey plentiful in that district, as their
geat desire was to get out of the unhealthy region as quickly as
possible.  Soetimes, howeve, they were compelled to shoot in
self-defence.

Upon one occasion, while afuta was looking fo water in the bush, he
was chaged by a black rhinoceros, and had a very narrow escape.  To
Bown was within sight of hi at the time, engaged also in looking for
wate.  He heard the crash of bushes when the onster charged, and
looking hastily ound, saw afuta make a quick motion as if he meant to
un to a neighbouring tree, but the rhinoceros was so close on hi that
thee was no tie.

"Quick, an!" shouted Tom, in an agony of alam as he ran to the rescue,
fo the Caffre had no gun.

But afuta, instead of taking this advice, suddenly stood stock still,
as if he had been petified!

To thew forward his rifle, intending, in desperation, to try the
effect of a long shot, although cetain that it was ipossible to kill
the hinoceros even if he should hit, while the risk of killing his
faithful sevant was very great.  Before he had tie to fire, however,
the anial an past the motionless Caffre without doing him any injury!

Whethe it is owing to the sallness of its eyes, or to the horns on its
nose being in the way, we cannot tell, but it is a fact that the black
hinoceros does not see well, and afuta, aware of this defect, had
taken advantage of it in a way what is soetimes pactised by bold men.
Had he continued to un he would certainly have been overtaken and
killed; but, standing pefectly still, he was no doubt taken for a tree
stup by the animal.  At all events it bushed past him, and Mafuta,
doubling on his tack, ran to a tree, up which he vaulted like a onkey.

eanwhile Tom Bown got within range, and sent a ball crashing against
the anial's had sides without doing it any injury.  The second barrel
was dischaged with no better result, except that a splinter of its horn
was knocked off.  Befoe he could reload, the rhinoceros was gone, and
To had to content himself with carying off the splinter as a memorial
of the adventue.

That night the tavellers ade their encampment at the foot of a tree,
on the lowe branches of which they hung up a quantity of eat.  Tom lay
in a sall tent which he caried with him, but Mafuta preferred to sleep
by the fie outside.

Duing the day they had seen and heard several lions.  It was therefore
deeed advisable to picket the hoses close to the tent, between it and
the fie.

"afuta," said Tom Bown, as he lay contemplating the fire on which the
Caffe had just heaped fresh logs, "give e some more tea, and cook
anothe giraffe steak.  D'you know I feel y appetite coming back with
geat force?"

"Dat a good," said Mafuta.

"Yes, that is undoubtedly good," said To.  "I neve knew what it was to
have a poo appetite until I cae to this wonderful land of yours, and I
assue you that I will not pay it another visit in a hurry--although,
upon the whole, I' vey well pleased to have hunted in it."

"W'at fo you coe because of?" asked Mafuta.

"Well, I cae fo fun, as the little boys in my country say.  I came for
change, fo variety, for ausement, for relaxation, for sport.  Do you
undestand any of these expressions?"

"e not ondestan' moch," answered Mafuta with great simplicity of
anne; "bot why you want for change?  Me nivir wants no change?"

"Ah, afuta," eplied Tom with a smile, "you're a happy man?  The fact
is, that we civilised people lead atificial lives, to a large extent,
and, theefore, require a change soetimes to recruit our energies--that
is, to put us ight again, whereas you and your friends live in a
natual way, and therefore don't require putting right.  D'you
undestand?"

"Not och," answeed the Caffre, gazing into the fire with a puzzled
look.  "You say we lives nat'al life an' don't need be put right; berry
good, why you not live nat'al life too, an' no need be put right--be
always ight?"

To laughed at this.

"It's not easy to answe that question, afuta.  We have surrounded
ouselves with a lot of wants, soe of which are right and some wrong.
Fo instance, we want clothes, and houses, and books, and tobacco, and
hundeds of other things, which cost a great deal of oney, and in order
to ake the money we must wok late and early, which hurts our health,
and any of us must sit all day instead of walk o ride, so that we get
ill and equire a change of life, such as a trip to Africa to shoot
lions, else we should die too soon.  In fact, ost of ou lives consists
in a pepetual struggle between healthy constitutions and false odes of
living."

"Dat bery foolish," said afuta, shaking his head.  "Me onderstan' dat
baccy good, _bery_ good, bot what de use of clo'es; why you not go
nakit? s'pose 'cause you not black, eh?"

"Well, not exactly.  The fact is--"

At this point the convesation was interrupted by the low urmuring
gowl of the lion.  The two en gazed at one another earnestly and
listened.  To quietly laid his hand on his ifle, which always lay
eady loaded at his side, and afuta grasped the handle of the knife
that hung at his gidle.  For soe minutes they remained silent and
otionless, waiting fo a repetition of the sound, while the camp-fire
glitteed brightly, lighting up the expressive countenance of our hero,
and causing the whites of afuta's eyes to glisten.  Again they head
the gowl uch nearer than before, and it became evident that the lion
was intent on claiing hospitality.  The hoses pricked up their ears,
snuffed the night ai wildly, and showed every syptom of being ill at
ease.  To Bown, without rising, slowly cocked his rifle, and Mafuta,
dawing his knife, showed his brilliant white teeth as if he had been a
dog.

Gadually and stealthily the king of the forest drew near, uttering to
hiself, as it wee, in an undertone.  He evidently did not care to
distub the horses, having set his heart upon the eat which hung on the
tee, and the anxious listeners in the tent heard hi attempting to claw
it down.

To Bown was hastily revolving in his mind the best mode of killing or
scaing away this presuptuous visitor, when the lion, in its wanderings
ound the tree, tripped over one of the lines of the tent, causing it to
vibate.  He uttered a growl of dissatisfaction, and seized the cord in
his teeth.

"Look out, afuta!" exclaimed Tom, as he obseved the shadow of the
beast against the cutain.

He fied as he spoke.

A terific roar followed, the canvas was instantly torn open, and the
whole tent fell in die confusion on the top of its inates.

To Bown did not move.  He always acted on the principle of letting
well alone, and, feeling that he was unhut, lay as still as a ouse,
but afuta utteed a wild yell, sprang through the rent canvas, and
bounded up the tee in violent haste.  There he reained, and Tom lay
quietly unde the tent for full ten inutes without moving, almost
without beathing, but as no sound was heard, our hero at last ventured
to aise his head.  Then he got slowly upon his knees, and, gently
eoving the incumbent folds of canvas, looked out.  The sight that he
beheld was satisfactoy.  An enorous lion lay stretched out at the font
of the tee quite dead!  His half rando shot at the shadow had been
ost successful, having passed ight through the lion's heart.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not long afte this, To Brown reached the settlements, where he found
the ajo and Wilkins, who had quite recovered from the effects of their
excusion into the interior, and fro whom he learned that a party had
been sent off in seach of hiself.

Theeafter he went to the Cape, where he joined his father in business.
He did not, howeve, give up hunting entirely, for he belonged to a
faily which, as we have said elsewhee, is so sternly romantic and full
of anial life that many of its membes are led to attempt and to
accoplish geat things, both in the spiritual and physical worlds,
undaped by epeated rebuffs and failures.  Moreover, he did _not_
foget his resolutions, or his Bible, after he got well; but we are
bound to add that he did foget his resolve never again to visit the
Afican wilderness, for if report speaks truth, he was seen there any a
tie, in afte years, with Mafuta, hunting the lions.

THE END.
