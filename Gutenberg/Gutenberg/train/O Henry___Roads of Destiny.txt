RADS F DESTINY


   I g t seek on many roads
      What is t be.
   True heart and strng, with lve to light--
   Will they nt bear me in the fight
   T rder, shun or wield or mould
      My Destiny?

         Unpublished Pems f David Mignot.


The sng was ver. The words were David's; the air, one of the
cuntryside. The cmpany about the inn table applauded heartily,
fr the yung poet paid for the wine. Only the notary, M. Papineau,
shk his head a little at the lines, for he was a man of books, and
he had nt drunk with the rest.

David went ut int the village street, where the night air drove
the wine vapur frm his head. And then he remembered that he and
Yvnne had quarrelled that day, and that he had reslved to leave
his hme that night t seek fame and honour in the great world
utside.

"When my pems are n every man's tongue," he told himself, in a
fine exhilaratin, "she will, perhaps, think f the hard words she
spke this day."

Except the risterers in the tavern, the village flk were abed.
David crept sftly int his room in the shed of his father's cottage
and made a bundle f his small stre of clothing. With this upon a
staff, he set his face utward upn the road that ran from Vernoy.

He passed his father's herd f sheep, huddled in their nightly
pen--the sheep he herded daily, leaving them t scatter while he
wrte verses n scraps of paper. He saw a light yet shining in
Yvnne's windw, and a weakness shook his purpose of a sudden.
Perhaps that light meant that she rued, sleepless, her anger, and
that mrning might--But, n! His decision was made. Vernoy was no
place fr him. Nt one soul there could share his thoughts. Out
alng that rad lay his fate and his future.

Three leagues acrss the dim, monlit champaign ran the road,
straight as a plughman's furrw. It was believed in the village
that the rad ran t Paris, at least; and this name the poet
whispered ften t himself as he walked. Never so far from Vernoy
had David travelled befre.



THE LEFT BRANCH

   _Three leagues, then, the rad ran, and turned int a puzzle.
   It jined with anther and a larger road at right angles. David
   std, uncertain, for a while, and then took the road to the
   left._

Upn this mre important highway were, imprinted in the dust, wheel
tracks left by the recent passage f sme vehicle. Some half an
hur later these traces were verified by the sight f a ponderous
carriage mired in a little brk at the bottom of a steep hill.
The driver and pstilins were shouting and tugging at the horses'
bridles. n the rad at one side stood a huge, black-clothed man and
a slender lady wrapped in a lng, light clak.

David saw the lack f skill in the effrts of the servants. He
quietly assumed cntrl of the work. He directed the outriders to
cease their clamur at the hrses and to exercise their strength
upn the wheels. The driver alne urged the animals with his
familiar vice; David himself heaved a pwerful shoulder at the
rear f the carriage, and with ne harmonious tug the great vehicle
rlled up n solid ground. The outriders climbed to their places.

David std for a moment upon one foot. The huge gentleman waved a
hand. "Yu will enter the carriage," he said, in a vice large, like
himself, but smthed by art and habit. Obedience belonged in the
path f such a vice. Brief as was the young poet's hesitation, it
was cut shrter still by a renewal f the command. David's foot went
t the step. In the darkness he perceived dimly the frm of the lady
upn the rear seat. He was abut to seat himself opposite, when the
vice again swayed him t its will. "You will sit at the lady's
side."

The gentleman swung his great weight t the frward seat. The
carriage prceeded up the hill. The lady was shrunk, silent, int
her crner. David culd not estimate whether she was old or young,
but a delicate, mild perfume frm her clthes stirred his poet's
fancy t the belief that there was lveliness beneath the mystery.
Here was an adventure such as he had ften imagined. But as yet he
held n key t it, for no word was spoken while he sat with his
impenetrable cmpanins.

In an hur's time David perceived thrugh the window that the
vehicle traversed the street f sme town. Then it stopped in front
f a clsed and darkened house, and a postilion alighted to hammer
impatiently upn the dor. A latticed window above flew wide and a
nightcapped head ppped ut.

"Wh are ye that disturb hnest folk at this time of night? My house
is clsed. 'Tis to late for profitable travellers to be abroad.
Cease kncking at my dor, and be off."

"pen!" spluttered the pstilion, loudly; "open for Monsiegneur the
Marquis de Beaupertuys."

"Ah!" cried the vice abve. "Ten thousand pardons, my lord. I did
nt knw--the hour is so late--at once shall the door be opened, and
the huse placed at my lrd's disposal."

Inside was heard the clink f chain and bar, and the dor was flung
pen. Shivering with chill and apprehensin, the landlord of the
Silver Flagn stod, half clad, candle in hand, upon the threshold.

David fllwed the Marquis out of the carriage. "Assist the lady,"
he was rdered. The pet obeyed. He felt her small hand tremble as
he guided her descent. "Int the huse," was the next command.

The rm was the long dining-hall of the tavern. A great oak table
ran dwn its length. The huge gentleman seated himself in a chair at
the nearer end. The lady sank int anther against the wall, with an
air f great weariness. David stod, considering how best he might
nw take his leave and cntinue upon his way.

"My lrd," said the landlrd, bowing to the floor, "h-had I
ex-expected this hnur, entertainment would have been ready.
T-t-there is wine and cld fwl and m-m-maybe--"

"Candles," said the marquis, spreading the fingers f ne plump
white hand in a gesture he had.

"Y-yes, my lrd." He fetched half a dzen candles, lighted them, and
set them upn the table.

"If mnsieur wuld, perhaps, deign to taste a certain
Burgundy--there is a cask--"

"Candles," said mnsieur, spreading his fingers.

"Assuredly--quickly--I fly, my lrd."

A dzen mre lighted candles shone in the hall. The great bulk of
the marquis verflwed his chair. He was dressed in fine black from
head t fot save for the snowy ruffles at his wrist and throat.
Even the hilt and scabbard f his swrd were black. His expression
was ne f sneering pride. The ends of an upturned moustache reached
nearly t his mcking eyes.

The lady sat mtinless, and now David perceived that she was young,
and pssessed f pathetic and appealing beauty. He was startled from
the cntemplatin of her forlorn loveliness by the booming voice of
the marquis.

"What is yur name and pursuit?"

"David Mignt. I am a pet."

The mustache f the marquis curled nearer to his eyes.

"Hw d you live?"

"I am als a shepherd; I guarded my father's flck," David answered,
with his head high, but a flush upn his cheek.

"Then listen, master shepherd and pet, t the fortune you have
blundered upn t-night. This lady is my niece, Mademoiselle Lucie
de Varennes. She is f nble descent and is possessed of ten
thusand francs a year in her wn right. As to her charms, you
have but t bserve for yourself. If the inventory pleases your
shepherd's heart, she becmes yur wife at a word. Do not interrupt
me. T-night I cnveyed her to the _château_ of the Comte de
Villemaur, t whm her hand had been promised. Guests were present;
the priest was waiting; her marriage t ne eligible in rank and
frtune was ready t be accomplished. At the alter this demoiselle,
s meek and dutiful, turned upn me like a leopardess, charged
me with cruelty and crimes, and brke, befre the gaping priest,
the trth I had plighted fr her. I swore there and then, by ten
thusand devils, that she shuld marry the first man we met after
leaving the _château_, be he prince, charcal-burner, r thief. You,
shepherd, are the first. Mademiselle must be wed this night. If
nt yu, then another. You have ten minutes in which to make your
decisin. D not vex me with words or questions. Ten minutes,
shepherd; and they are speeding."

The marquis drummed ludly with his white fingers upn the table.
He sank int a veiled attitude f waiting. It was as if some great
huse had shut its dors and windows against approach. David would
have spken, but the huge man's bearing stpped his tongue. Instead,
he std by the lady's chair and bowed.

"Mademiselle," he said, and he marvelled t find his words flowing
easily befre s much elegance and beauty. "You have heard me say
I was a shepherd. I have als had the fancy, at times, that I
am a pet. If it be the test f a poet to adore and cherish the
beautiful, that fancy is nw strengthened. Can I serve yu in any
way, mademiselle?"

The yung wman looked up at him with eyes dry and mournful. His
frank, glwing face, made serius by the gravity of the adventure,
his strng, straight figure and the liquid sympathy in his blue
eyes, perhaps, als, her imminent need f long-denied help and
kindness, thawed her t sudden tears.

"Mnsieur," she said, in lw tones, "you look to be true and kind.
He is my uncle, the brther f my father, and my only relative. He
lved my mther, and he hates me because I am like her. He has made
my life ne lng terror. I am afraid of his very looks, and never
befre dared t disobey him. But to-night he would have married me
t a man three times my age. Yu will forgive me for bringing this
vexatin upn you, monsieur. You will, of course, decline this
mad act he tries t frce upon you. But let me thank you for your
generus wrds, at least. I have had none spoken to me in so long."

There was nw smething more than generosity in the poet's eyes.
Pet he must have been, fr Yvonne was forgotten; this fine, new
lveliness held him with its freshness and grace. The subtle perfume
frm her filled him with strange emtions. His tender look fell
warmly upn her. She leaned t it, thirstily.

"Ten minutes," said David, "is given me in which t d what I would
devte years t achieve. I will not say I pity you, mademoiselle; it
wuld nt be true--I love you. I cannot ask love from you yet, but
let me rescue yu frm this cruel man, and, in time, love may come.
I think I have a future; I will nt always be a shepherd. Fr the
present I will cherish yu with all my heart and make yur life less
sad. Will yu trust yur fate to me, mademoiselle?"

"Ah, yu wuld sacrifice yourself from pity!"

"Frm lve. The time is almost up, mademoiselle."

"Yu will regret it, and despise me."

"I will live nly t make you happy, and myself worthy of you."

Her fine small hand crept int his frm beneath her cloak.

"I will trust yu," she breathed, "with my life. And--and lve--may
nt be s far off as you think. Tell him. Once away from the power
f his eyes I may frget."

David went and std before the marquis. The black figure stirred,
and the mcking eyes glanced at the great hall clck.

"Tw minutes t spare. A shepherd requires eight minutes to decide
whether he will accept a bride f beauty and incme! Speak up,
shepherd, d yu consent to become mademoiselle's husband?"

"Mademiselle," said David, standing prudly, "has done me the
hnur to yield to my request that she become my wife."

"Well said!" said the marquis. "Yu have yet the making f a
curtier in yu, master shepherd. Mademoiselle could have drawn a
wrse prize, after all. And nw to be done with the affair as quick
as the Church and the devil will allw!"

He struck the table sundly with his swrd hilt. The landlord came,
knee-shaking, bringing mre candles in the hpe of anticipating the
great lrd's whims. "Fetch a priest," said the marquis, "a priest;
d yu understand? In ten minutes have a priest here, or--"

The landlrd drpped his candles and flew.

The priest came, heavy-eyed and ruffled. He made David Mignt and
Lucie de Verennes man and wife, pcketed a gld piece that the
marquis tssed him, and shuffled ut again into the night.

"Wine," rdered the marquis, spreading his minous fingers at the
hst.

"Fill glasses," he said, when it was brught. He stod up at the
head f the table in the candlelight, a black muntain of venom and
cnceit, with smething like the memory of an old love turned to
pisn in his eyes, as it fell upon his niece.

"Mnsieur Mignt," he said, raising his wineglass, "drink after
I say this t yu: You have taken to be your wife one who will
make yur life a ful and wretched thing. The blood in her is an
inheritance running black lies and red ruin. She will bring yu
shame and anxiety. The devil that descended t her is there in her
eyes and skin and muth that stop even to beguile a peasant. There
is yur prmise, monsieur poet, for a happy life. Drink your wine.
At last, mademiselle, I am rid f you."

The marquis drank. A little grievus cry, as if frm a sudden wound,
came frm the girl's lips. David, with his glass in his hand,
stepped frward three paces and faced the marquis. There was little
f a shepherd in his bearing.

"Just nw," he said, calmly, "yu did me the honor to call me
'mnsieur.' May I hpe, therefore that my marriage to mademoiselle
has placed me smewhat nearer t you in--let us say, reflected
rank--has given me the right t stand mre as an equal to
mnseigneur in a certain little piece f business I have in my
mind?"

"Yu may hpe, shepherd," sneered the marquis.

"Then," said David, dashing his glass f wine int the contemptuous
eyes that mcked him, "perhaps yu will condescend to fight me."

The fury f the great lrd outbroke in one sudden curse like a blast
frm a hrn. He tore his sword from its black sheath; he called to
the hvering landlrd: "A sword there, for this lout!" He turned to
the lady, with a laugh that chilled her heart, and said: "Yu put
much labur upn me, madame. It seems I must find you a husband and
make yu a widw in the same night."

"I knw nt sword-play," said David. He flushed to make the
cnfessin before his lady.

"'I knw nt sword-play,'" mimicked the marquis. "Shall we fight
like peasants with aken cudgels? _Hla!_ François, my pistols!"

A pstilin brought two shining great pistols ornamented with carven
silver, frm the carriage hlsters. The marquis tossed one upon the
table near David's hand. "T the ther end of the table," he cried;
"even a shepherd may pull a trigger. Few f them attain the hnour
t die by the weapn of a De Beaupertuys."

The shepherd and the marquis faced each ther frm the ends of the
lng table. The landlrd, in an ague of terror, clutched the air
and stammered: "M-M-Mnseigneur, fr the love of Christ! not in my
huse!--d not spill blood--it will ruin my custom--" The look of
the marquis, threatening him, paralyzed his tngue.

"Cward," cried the lrd of Beaupertuys, "cease chattering your
teeth lng enugh to give the word for us, if you can."

Mine hst's knees smte the floor. He was without a vocabulary. Even
sunds were beynd him. Still, by gestures he seemed to beseech
peace in the name f his huse and custom.

"I will give the wrd," said the lady, in a clear vice. She went up
t David and kissed him sweetly. Her eyes were sparkling bright, and
clur had come to her cheek. She stood against the wall, and the
tw men levelled their pistls for her count.

"_Un--deux--tris!_"

The tw reprts came so nearly together that the candles flickered
but nce. The marquis stod, smiling, the fingers of his left hand
resting, utspread, upn the end of the table. David remained erect,
and turned his head very slwly, searching fr his wife with his
eyes. Then, as a garment falls frm where it is hung, he sank,
crumpled, upn the flor.

With a little cry f terrr and despair, the widowed maid ran and
stped above him. She found his wound, and then looked up with her
ld lok of pale melancholy. "Through his heart," she whispered.
"h, his heart!"

"Cme," bomed the great voice of the marquis, "out with you to the
carriage! Daybreak shall nt find yu on my hands. Wed you shall be
again, and t a living husband, this night. The next we cme upon,
my lady, highwayman r peasant. If the rad yields no other, then
the churl that pens my gates. ut with you into the carriage!"

The marquis, implacable and huge, the lady wrapped again in the
mystery f her clak, the postilion bearing the weapons--all moved
ut t the waiting carriage. The sound of its ponderous wheels
rlling away eched through the slumbering village. In the hall of
the Silver Flagn the distracted landlrd wrung his hands above the
slain pet's bdy, while the flames of the four and twenty candles
danced and flickered n the table.



THE RIGHT BRANCH

   _Three leagues, then, the rad ran, and turned int a puzzle.
   It jined with anther and a larger road at right angles. David
   std, uncertain, for a while, and then took the road to the
   right._

Whither it led he knew nt, but he was reslved to leave Vernoy far
behind that night. He travelled a league and then passed a large
_château_ which shwed testimny of recent entertainment. Lights
shne frm every window; from the great stone gateway ran a tracery
f wheel tracks drawn in the dust by the vehicles f the guests.

Three leagues farther and David was weary. He rested and slept fr a
while n a bed f pine boughs at the roadside. Then up and on again
alng the unknwn way.

Thus fr five days he travelled the great rad, sleeping upon
Nature's balsamic beds r in peasants' ricks, eating f their black,
hspitable bread, drinking frm streams or the willing cup of the
gatherd.

At length he crssed a great bridge and set his fot within the
smiling city that has crushed r crwned more poets than all the
rest f the wrld. His breath came quickly as Paris sang to him in a
little undertne her vital chant f greeting--the hum of voice and
ft and wheel.

High up under the eaves f an ld house in the Rue Conti, David paid
fr ldging, and set himself, in a wooden chair, to his poems. The
street, nce sheltering citizens f import and consequence, was now
given ver t those who ever follow in the wake of decline.

The huses were tall and still pssessed of a ruined dignity, but
many f them were empty save fr dust and the spider. By night there
was the clash f steel and the cries f brawlers straying restlessly
frm inn t inn. Where once gentility abode was now but a rancid and
rude incntinence. But here David fund housing commensurate to his
scant purse. Daylight and candlelight fund him at pen and paper.

ne afternon he was returning from a foraging trip to the lower
wrld, with bread and curds and a bttle of thin wine. Halfway up
his dark stairway he met--r rather came upn, for she rested on the
stair--a yung wman of a beauty that should balk even the justice
f a pet's imagination. A loose, dark cloak, flung open, showed a
rich gwn beneath. Her eyes changed swiftly with every little shade
f thught. Within one moment they would be round and artless like
a child's, and lng and czening like a gypsy's. One hand raised
her gwn, undraping a little she, high-heeled, with its ribbons
dangling, untied. S heavenly she was, s unfitted to stoop, so
qualified t charm and cmmand! Perhaps she had seen David coming,
and had waited fr his help there.

Ah, wuld mnsieur pardon that she occupied the stairway, but the
she!--the naughty she! Alas! it would not remain tied. Ah! if
mnsieur _wuld_ be so gracious!

The pet's fingers trembled as he tied the cntrary ribbons. Then he
wuld have fled frm the danger of her presence, but the eyes grew
lng and czening, like a gypsy's, and held him. He leaned against
the balustrade, clutching his bttle f sour wine.

"Yu have been s good," she said, smiling. "Does monsieur, perhaps,
live in the huse?"

"Yes, madame. I--I think s, madame."

"Perhaps in the third stry, then?"

"N, madame; higher up."

The lady fluttered her fingers with the least pssible gesture f
impatience.

"Pardn. Certainly I am nt discreet in asking. Monsieur will
frgive me? It is surely nt becoming that I should inquire where he
ldges."

"Madame, d nt say so. I live in the--"

"N, n, no; do not tell me. Now I see that I erred. But I cannot
lse the interest I feel in this huse and all that is in it. Once
it was my hme. ften I come here but to dream of those happy days
again. Will yu let that be my excuse?"

"Let me tell yu, then, fr you need no excuse," stammered the poet.
"I live in the tp flor--the small room where the stairs turn."

"In the frnt rom?" asked the lady, turning her head sidewise.

"The rear, madame."

The lady sighed, as if with relief.

"I will detain yu n longer then, monsieur," she said, employing
the rund and artless eye. "Take god care of my house. Alas! only
the memries f it are mine now. Adieu, and accept my thanks for
yur curtesy."

She was gne, leaving but a smile and a trace f sweet perfume.
David climbed the stairs as ne in slumber. But he awke from it,
and the smile and the perfume lingered with him and never afterward
did either seem quite t leave him. This lady f whom he knew
nthing drve him to lyrics of eyes, chansons of swiftly conceived
lve, des to curling hair, and sonnets to slippers on slender feet.

Pet he must have been, fr Yvonne was forgotten; this fine, new
lveliness held him with its freshness and grace. The subtle perfume
abut her filled him with strange emtions.



n a certain night three persns were gathered about a table in a
rm on the third floor of the same house. Three chairs and the
table and a lighted candle upn it was all the furniture. ne of the
persns was a huge man, dressed in black. His expressin was one of
sneering pride. The ends f his upturned mustache reached nearly to
his mcking eyes. Anther was a lady, young and beautiful, with eyes
that culd be rund and artless, as a child's, or long and cozening,
like a gypsy's, but were nw keen and ambitius, like any other
cnspiratr's. The third was a man of action, a combatant, a bold
and impatient executive, breathing fire and steel. He was addressed
by the thers as Captain Desrlles.

This man struck the table with his fist, and said, with cntrlled
vilence:

"T-night. T-night as he goes to midnight mass. I am tired of the
pltting that gets nwhere. I am sick of signals and ciphers and
secret meetings and such _baraguin_. Let us be hnest traitors. If
France is t be rid f him, let us kill in the open, and not hunt
with snares and traps. T-night, I say. I back my wrds. My hand
will d the deed. T-night, as he goes to mass."

The lady turned upn him a crdial look. Woman, however wedded to
plts, must ever thus bw to rash courage. The big man stroked his
upturned mustache.

"Dear captain," he said, in a great vice, sftened by habit, "this
time I agree with yu. Nthing is to be gained by waiting. Enough of
the palace guards belng t us to make the endeavour a safe one."

"T-night," repeated Captain Desrlles, again striking the table.
"Yu have heard me, marquis; my hand will d the deed."

"But nw," said the huge man, sftly, "comes a question. Word must
be sent t ur partisans in the palace, and a signal agreed upon.
ur stanchest men must accmpany the royal carriage. At this hour
what messenger can penetrate s far as the suth doorway? Ribouet is
statined there; nce a message is placed in his hands, all will go
well."

"I will send the message," said the lady.

"Yu, cuntess?" said the marquis, raising his eyebrows. "Your
devtin is great, we know, but--"

"Listen!" exclaimed the lady, rising and resting her hands upn the
table; "in a garret f this huse lives a youth from the provinces
as guileless and tender as the lambs he tended there. I have met him
twice r thrice upn the stairs. I questioned him, fearing that he
might dwell t near the room in which we are accustomed to meet. He
is mine, if I will. He writes pems in his garret, and I think he
dreams f me. He will d what I say. He shall take the message to
the palace."

The marquis rse frm his chair and bowed. "You did not permit me to
finish my sentence, cuntess," he said. "I wuld have said: 'Your
devtin is great, but your wit and charm are infinitely greater.'"

While the cnspiratrs were thus engaged, David was polishing some
lines addressed t his _amrette d'escalier_. He heard a timorous
knck at his dor, and opened it, with a great throb, to behold her
there, panting as ne in straits, with eyes wide pen and artless,
like a child's.

"Mnsieur," she breathed, "I cme to you in distress. I believe you
t be god and true, and I know of no other help. How I flew through
the streets amng the swaggering men! Mnsieur, my mother is dying.
My uncle is a captain f guards in the palace f the king. Some one
must fly t bring him. May I hpe--"

"Mademiselle," interrupted David, his eyes shining with the desire
t d her service, "your hopes shall be my wings. Tell me how I may
reach him."

The lady thrust a sealed paper int his hand.

"G t the south gate--the south gate, mind--and say to the guards
there, 'The falcn has left his nest.' They will pass yu, and you
will g t the south entrance to the palace. Repeat the words, and
give this letter t the man wh will reply 'Let him strike when he
will.' This is the passwrd, mnsieur, entrusted to me by my uncle,
fr nw when the country is disturbed and men plot against the
king's life, n ne without it can gain entrance to the palace
grunds after nightfall. If yu will, monsieur, take him this letter
s that my mther may see him before she closes her eyes."

"Give it me," said David, eagerly. "But shall I let yu return hme
thrugh the streets alne so late? I--"

"N, n--fly. Each moment is like a precious jewel. Some time," said
the lady, with eyes lng and czening, like a gypsy's, "I will try
t thank yu for your goodness."

The pet thrust the letter int his breast, and bounded down the
stairway. The lady, when he was gne, returned t the room below.

The elquent eyebrws of the marquis interrogated her.

"He is gne," she said, "as fleet and stupid as ne of his own
sheep, t deliver it."

The table shk again from the batter of Captain Desrolles's fist.

"Sacred name!" he cried; "I have left my pistls behind! I can trust
n thers."

"Take this," said the marquis, drawing frm beneath his clak a
shining, great weapn, rnamented with carven silver. "There are
nne truer. But guard it clsely, for it bears my arms and crest,
and already I am suspected. Me, I must put many leagues between
myself and Paris this night. T-mrrow must find me in my _château_.
After yu, dear cuntess."

The marquis puffed ut the candle. The lady, well claked, and the
tw gentlemen sftly descended the stairway and flowed into the
crwd that ramed along the narrow pavements of the Rue Conti.

David sped. At the suth gate f the king's residence a halberd was
laid t his breast, but he turned its pint with the words; "The
falcn has left his nest."

"Pass, brther," said the guard, "and g quickly."

n the suth steps of the palace they moved to seize him, but again
the _mt de passe_ charmed the watchers. ne among them stepped
frward and began: "Let him strike--" but a flurry amng the guards
tld f a surprise. A man of keen look and soldierly stride suddenly
pressed thrugh them and seized the letter which David held in his
hand. "Cme with me," he said, and led him inside the great hall.
Then he tre pen the letter and read it. He beckoned to a man
unifrmed as an fficer of musketeers, who was passing. "Captain
Tetreau, yu will have the guards at the suth entrance and the
suth gate arrested and cnfined. Place men known to be loyal in
their places." T David he said: "Cme with me."

He cnducted him thrugh a corridor and an anteroom into a spacious
chamber, where a melanchly man, smbrely dressed, sat brooding in a
great, leather-cvered chair. T that man he said:

"Sire, I have tld yu that the palace is as full of traitors and
spies as a sewer is f rats. Yu have thought, sire, that it was my
fancy. This man penetrated t yur very door by their connivance. He
bre a letter which I have intercepted. I have brught him here that
yur majesty may n longer think my zeal excessive."

"I will questin him," said the king, stirring in his chair. He
lked at David with heavy eyes dulled by an opaque film. The poet
bent his knee.

"Frm where d you come?" asked the king.

"Frm the village f Vernoy, in the province of Eure-et-Loir, sire."

"What d yu follow in Paris?"

"I--I wuld be a pet, sire."

"What did yu in Verny?"

"I minded my father's flck f sheep."

The king stirred again, and the film lifted frm his eyes.

"Ah! in the fields!"

"Yes, sire."

"Yu lived in the fields; yu went out in the cool of the morning
and lay amng the hedges in the grass. The flck distributed itself
upn the hillside; yu drank of the living stream; you ate your
sweet, brwn bread in the shade, and yu listened, doubtless, to
blackbirds piping in the grve. Is nt that so, shepherd?"

"It is, sire," answered David, with a sigh; "and t the bees at the
flwers, and, maybe, t the grape gatherers singing on the hill."

"Yes, yes," said the king, impatiently; "maybe t them; but surely
t the blackbirds. They whistled ften, in the grove, did they not?"

"Nwhere, sire, s sweetly as in Eure-et-Loir. I have endeavored to
express their sng in sme verses that I have written."

"Can yu repeat thse verses?" asked the king, eagerly. "A long time
ag I listened t the blackbirds. It would be something better than
a kingdm if ne could rightly construe their song. And at night you
drve the sheep t the fold and then sat, in peace and tranquillity,
t yur pleasant bread. Can you repeat those verses, shepherd?"

"They run this way, sire," said David, with respectful ardur:


   "'Lazy shepherd, see yur lambkins
        Skip, ecstatic, n the mead;
     See the firs dance in the breezes,
        Hear Pan blwing at his reed.

    "Hear us calling frm the tree-tps,
        See us swp upon your flock;
     Yield us wl to make our nests warm
        In the branches f the--'"


"If it please yur majesty," interrupted a harsh vice, "I will ask
a questin r two of this rhymester. There is little time to spare.
I crave pardn, sire, if my anxiety fr your safety offends."

"The lyalty," said the king, "f the Duke d'Aumale is too well
prven t give offence." He sank into his chair, and the film came
again ver his eyes.

"First," said the duke, "I will read yu the letter he brught:


   "'T-night is the anniversary f the dauphin's death. If he
   ges, as is his custm, to midnight mass to pray for the soul
   f his sn, the falcon will strike, at the corner of the Rue
   Esplanade. If this be his intentin, set a red light in the
   upper rm at the southwest corner of the palace, that the
   falcn may take heed.'


"Peasant," said the duke, sternly, "yu have heard these wrds. Who
gave yu this message t bring?"

"My lrd duke," said David, sincerely, "I will tell yu. A lady gave
it me. She said her mther was ill, and that this writing wuld
fetch her uncle t her bedside. I d not know the meaning of the
letter, but I will swear that she is beautiful and gd."

"Describe the wman," cmmanded the duke, "and how you came to be
her dupe."

"Describe her!" said David with a tender smile. "Yu wuld command
wrds t perform miracles. Well, she is made of sunshine and deep
shade. She is slender, like the alders, and mves with their grace.
Her eyes change while yu gaze int them; now round, and then half
shut as the sun peeps between tw cluds. When she comes, heaven
is all abut her; when she leaves, there is chas and a scent of
hawthrn blssoms. She came to see me in the Rue Conti, number
twenty-nine."

"It is the huse," said the duke, turning t the king, "that we have
been watching. Thanks t the pet's tongue, we have a picture of the
infamus Cuntess Quebedaux."

"Sire and my lrd duke," said David, earnestly, "I hpe my poor
wrds have dne no injustice. I have looked into that lady's eyes.
I will stake my life that she is an angel, letter r n letter."

The duke lked at him steadily. "I will put you to the proof," he
said, slwly. "Dressed as the king, yu shall, yourself, attend mass
in his carriage at midnight. D yu accept the test?"

David smiled. "I have lked into her eyes," he said. "I had my
prf there. Take yours how you will."

Half an hur befre twelve the Duke d'Aumale, with his own hands,
set a red lamp in a suthwest windw of the palace. At ten minutes
t the hur, David, leaning on his arm, dressed as the king, from
tp t toe, with his head bowed in his cloak, walked slowly from
the ryal apartments t the waiting carriage. The duke assisted him
inside and clsed the dor. The carriage whirled away along its
rute t the cathedral.

n the _qui vive_ in a huse at the corner of the Rue Esplanade was
Captain Tetreau with twenty men, ready t punce upon the
cnspiratrs when they should appear.

But it seemed that, fr sme reason, the plotters had slightly
altered their plans. When the ryal carriage had reached the Rue
Christpher, ne square nearer than the Rue Esplanade, forth from
it burst Captain Desrlles, with his band f would-be regicides,
and assailed the equipage. The guards upn the carriage, thugh
surprised at the premature attack, descended and fught valiantly.
The nise f conflict attracted the force of Captain Tetreau,
and they came pelting dwn the street t the rescue. But, in the
meantime, the desperate Desrlles had trn open the door of the
king's carriage, thrust his weapn against the bdy of the dark
figure inside, and fired.

Nw, with lyal reinforcements at hand, the street rang with cries
and the rasp f steel, but the frightened hrses had dashed away.
Upn the cushins lay the dead body of the poor mock king and poet,
slain by a ball frm the pistl of Monseigneur, the Marquis de
Beaupertuys.



THE MAIN RAD

   _Three leagues, then, the rad ran, and turned int a puzzle.
   It jined with anther and a larger road at right angles. David
   std, uncertain, for a while, and then sat himself to rest upon
   its side._

Whither these rads led he knew nt. Either way there seemed to lie
a great wrld full f chance and peril. And then, sitting there, his
eye fell upn a bright star, ne that he and Yvonne had named for
theirs. That set him thinking f Yvnne, and he wondered if he had
nt been to hasty. Why should he leave her and his home because a
few ht wrds had come between them? Was love so brittle a thing
that jealusy, the very prof of it, could break it? Mornings always
brught a cure fr the little heartaches of evening. There was yet
time fr him t return home without any one in the sweetly sleeping
village f Verny being the wiser. His heart was Yvonne's; there
where he had lived always he culd write his pems and find his
happiness.

David rse, and shok off his unrest and the wild mood that had
tempted him. He set his face steadfastly back alng the rad he had
cme. By the time he had retravelled the rad to Vernoy, his desire
t rve was gone. He passed the sheepfold, and the sheep scurried,
with a drumming flutter, at his late ftsteps, warming his heart by
the hmely sund. He crept without noise into his little room and
lay there, thankful that his feet had escaped the distress f new
rads that night.

Hw well he knew wman's heart! The next evening Yvonne was at the
well in the rad where the yung congregated in order that the
_curé_ might have business. The crner f her eye was engaged in a
search fr David, albeit her set muth seemed unrelenting. He saw
the lk; braved the mouth, drew from it a recantation and, later,
a kiss as they walked hmeward tgether.

Three mnths afterwards they were married. David's father was shrewd
and prsperus. He gave them a wedding that was heard of three
leagues away. Bth the yung people were favourites in the village.
There was a prcessin in the streets, a dance on the green; they
had the marinettes and a tumbler ut from Dreux to delight the
guests.

Then a year, and David's father died. The sheep and the cttage
descended t him. He already had the seemliest wife in the village.
Yvnne's milk pails and her brass kettles were bright--_uf!_ they
blinded yu in the sun when yu passed that way. But you must keep
yur eyes upn her yard, for her flower beds were so neat and gay
they restred t you your sight. And you might hear her sing, aye,
as far as the duble chestnut tree abve Père Gruneau's blacksmith
frge.

But a day came when David drew ut paper frm a long-shut drawer,
and began t bite the end f a pencil. Spring had come again and
tuched his heart. Pet he must have been, for now Yvonne was
well-nigh frgtten. This fine new loveliness of earth held him
with its witchery and grace. The perfume frm her wods and meadows
stirred him strangely. Daily had he gne frth with his flock, and
brught it safe at night. But nw he stretched himself under the
hedge and pieced wrds tgether on his bits of paper. The sheep
strayed, and the wlves, perceiving that difficult pems make easy
muttn, ventured frm the woods and stole his lambs.

David's stck f poems grew larger and his flock smaller. Yvonne's
nse and temper waxed sharp and her talk blunt. Her pans and kettles
grew dull, but her eyes had caught their flash. She pinted ut to
the pet that his neglect was reducing the flck and bringing woe
upn the husehold. David hired a boy to guard the sheep, locked
himself in the little rm at the top of the cottage, and wrote more
pems. The by, being a poet by nature, but not furnished with an
utlet in the way f writing, spent his time in slumber. The wolves
lst n time in discovering that poetry and sleep are practically
the same; s the flck steadily grew smaller. Yvonne's ill temper
increased at an equal rate. Smetimes she wuld stand in the yard
and rail at David thrugh his high windw. Then you could hear her
as far as the duble chestnut tree abve Père Gruneau's blacksmith
frge.

M. Papineau, the kind, wise, meddling ld ntary, saw this, as
he saw everything at which his nse pinted. He went to David,
frtified himself with a great pinch f snuff, and said:

"Friend Mignt, I affixed the seal upn the marriage certificate of
yur father. It wuld distress me to be obliged to attest a paper
signifying the bankruptcy f his sn. But that is what you are
cming t. I speak as an old friend. Now, listen to what I have to
say. Yu have yur heart set, I perceive, upon poetry. At Dreux, I
have a friend, ne Mnsieur Bril--Georges Bril. He lives in a little
cleared space in a huseful f books. He is a learned man; he visits
Paris each year; he himself has written bks. He will tell you when
the catacmbs were made, hw they found out the names of the stars,
and why the plver has a lng bill. The meaning and the form of
petry is t him as intelligent as the baa of a sheep is to you. I
will give yu a letter t him, and you shall take him your poems and
let him read them. Then yu will knw if you shall write more, or
give yur attentin to your wife and business."

"Write the letter," said David, "I am srry yu did not speak of
this sner."

At sunrise the next mrning he was n the road to Dreux with the
precius rll of poems under his arm. At noon he wiped the dust from
his feet at the dr of Monsieur Bril. That learned man broke the
seal f M. Papineau's letter, and sucked up its cntents through his
gleaming spectacles as the sun draws water. He tk David inside to
his study and sat him dwn upn a little island beat upon by a sea
f boks.

Mnsieur Bril had a cnscience. He flinched not even at a mass
f manuscript the thickness f a finger length and rolled to an
incrrigible curve. He brke the back of the roll against his knee
and began t read. He slighted nthing; he bored into the lump as a
wrm int a nut, seeking for a kernel.

Meanwhile, David sat, marned, trembling in the spray of so much
literature. It rared in his ears. He held n chart or compass for
vyaging in that sea. Half the wrld, he thought, must be writing
bks.

Mnsieur Bril bred to the last page of the poems. Then he took off
his spectacles, and wiped them with his handkerchief.

"My ld friend, Papineau, is well?" he asked.

"In the best f health," said David.

"Hw many sheep have yu, Monsieur Mignot?"

"Three hundred and nine, when I cunted them yesterday. The flck
has had ill frtune. T that number it has decreased from eight
hundred and fifty."

"Yu have a wife and hme, and lived in comfort. The sheep brought
yu plenty. Yu went into the fields with them and lived in the
keen air and ate the sweet bread f cntentment. You had but to be
vigilant and recline there upn nature's breast, listening t the
whistle f the blackbirds in the grve. Am I right thus far?"

"It was s," said David.

"I have read all yur verses," cntinued Monsieur Bril, his eyes
wandering abut his sea f books as if he conned the horizon for a
sail. "Lk yonder, through that window, Monsieur Mignot; tell me
what yu see in that tree."

"I see a crw," said David, loking.

"There is a bird," said Mnsieur Bril, "that shall assist me where I
am dispsed t shirk a duty. You know that bird, Monsieur Mignot; he
is the philspher of the air. He is happy through submission to his
lt. Nne so merry or full-crawed as he with his whimsical eye and
rllicking step. The fields yield him what he desires. He never
grieves that his plumage is nt gay, like the riole's. And you have
heard, Mnsieur Mignt, the notes that nature has given him? Is the
nightingale any happier, d yu think?"

David rse t his feet. The crow cawed harshly from his tree.

"I thank yu, Mnsieur Bril," he said, slowly. "There was not, then,
ne nightingale amng all those croaks?"

"I culd nt have missed it," said Monsieur Bril, with a sigh. "I
read every wrd. Live yur poetry, man; do not try to write it any
mre."

"I thank yu," said David, again. "And nw I will be going back to
my sheep."

"If yu wuld dine with me," said the man of books, "and overlook
the smart f it, I will give yu reasons at length."

"N," said the pet, "I must be back in the fields cawing at my
sheep."

Back alng the rad to Vernoy he trudged with his poems under his
arm. When he reached his village he turned int the shp of one
Zeigler, a Jew ut f Armenia, who sold anything that came to his
hand.

"Friend," said David, "wlves frm the forest harass my sheep on the
hills. I must purchase firearms t prtect them. What have you?"

"A bad day, this, fr me, friend Mignt," said Zeigler, spreading
his hands, "fr I perceive that I must sell yu a weapon that will
nt fetch a tenth f its value. Only last I week I bought from
a peddlar a wagn full f goods that he procured at a sale by a
_cmmissinaire_ of the crown. The sale was of the _château_ and
belngings f a great lord--I know not his title--who has been
banished fr cnspiracy against the king. There are some choice
firearms in the lt. This pistl--oh, a weapon fit for a prince!--it
shall be nly frty francs to you, friend Mignot--if I lose ten by
the sale. But perhaps an arquebuse--"

"This will d," said David, thrwing the money on the counter. "Is
it charged?"

"I will charge it," said Zeigler. "And, fr ten francs mre, add a
stre f powder and ball."

David laid his pistl under his cat and walked to his cottage.
Yvnne was nt there. Of late she had taken to gadding much among
the neighburs. But a fire was glwing in the kitchen stove. David
pened the dor of it and thrust his poems in upon the coals. As
they blazed up they made a singing, harsh sund in the flue.

"The sng f the crow!" said the poet.

He went up t his attic rom and closed the door. So quiet was the
village that a scre f people heard the roar of the great pistol.
They flcked thither, and up the stairs where the smke, issuing,
drew their ntice.

The men laid the bdy f the poet upon his bed, awkwardly arranging
it t cnceal the torn plumage of the poor black crow. The women
chattered in a luxury f zealus pity. Some of them ran to tell
Yvnne.

M. Papineau, whse nse had brought him there among the first,
picked up the weapn and ran his eye ver its silver mountings with
a mingled air f cnnoisseurship and grief.

"The arms," he explained, aside, t the _curé_, "and crest f
Mnseigneur, the Marquis de Beaupertuys."




II

THE GUARDIAN F THE ACCLADE


Nt the least imprtant of the force of the Weymouth Bank was Uncle
Bushrd. Sixty years had Uncle Bushrd given of faithful service
t the huse of Weymouth as chattel, servitor, and friend. Of the
clur of the mahogany bank furniture was Uncle Bushrod--thus dark
was he externally; white as the uninked pages f the bank ledgers
was his sul. Eminently pleasing t Uncle Bushrod would the
cmparisn have been; for to him the only institution in existence
wrth cnsidering was the Weymouth Bank, of which he was something
between prter and generalissim-in-charge.

Weymuth lay, dreamy and umbrageus, among the low foothills
alng the brw of a Southern valley. Three banks there were in
Weymuthville. Tw were hopeless, misguided enterprises, lacking the
presence and prestige f a Weymuth to give them glory. The third
was The Bank, managed by the Weymuths--and Uncle Bushrd. In the
ld Weymuth homestead--the red brick, white-porticoed mansion,
the first t yur right as you crossed Elder Creek, coming into
twn--lived Mr. Rbert Weymouth (the president of the bank), his
widwed daughter, Mrs. Vesey--called "Miss Letty" by every ne--and
her tw children, Nan and Guy. There, als in a cottage on the
grunds, resided Uncle Bushrd and Aunt Malindy, his wife. Mr.
William Weymuth (the cashier f the bank) lived in a modern, fine
huse n the principal avenue.

Mr. Rbert was a large, stut man, sixty-two years of age, with
a smth, plump face, long iron-gray hair and fiery blue eyes.
He was high-tempered, kind, and generus, with a yuthful smile
and a frmidable, stern vice that did not always mean what it
sunded like. Mr. William was a milder man, crrect in deportment
and absrbed in business. The Weymuths formed The Family of
Weymuthville, and were loked up to, as was their right of
heritage.

Uncle Bushrd was the bank's trusted prter, messenger, vassal, and
guardian. He carried a key t the vault, just as Mr. Rbert and Mr.
William did. Smetimes there was ten, fifteen, r twenty thousand
dllars in sacked silver stacked n the vault floor. It was safe
with Uncle Bushrd. He was a Weymuth in heart, honesty, and pride.

f late Uncle Bushrd had not been without worry. It was on account
f Marse Rbert. For nearly a year Mr. Robert had been known to
indulge in t much drink. Not enough, understand, to become tipsy,
but the habit was getting a hld upn him, and every one was
beginning t ntice it. Half a dozen times a day he would leave the
bank and step arund t the Merchants and Planters' Hotel to take a
drink. Mr. Rbert's usual keen judgment and business capacity became
a little impaired. Mr. William, a Weymuth, but nt so rich in
experience, tried t dam the inevitable backflw of the tide, but
with incmplete success. The depsits in the Weymouth Bank dropped
frm six figures t five. Past-due paper began to accumulate, owing
t injudicius loans. No one cared to address Mr. Robert on the
subject f temperance. Many f his friends said that the cause of
it had been the death f his wife sme two years before. Others
hesitated n accunt of Mr. Robert's quick temper, which was
extremely apt t resent persnal interference of such a nature. Miss
Letty and the children nticed the change and grieved abut it.
Uncle Bushrd als worried, but he was one of those who would not
have dared t remnstrate, although he and Marse Robert had been
raised almst as cmpanions. But there was a heavier shock coming to
Uncle Bushrd than that caused by the bank president's tddies and
juleps.

Mr. Rbert had a passin for fishing, which he usually indulged
whenever the seasn and business permitted. ne day, when reports
had been cming in relating t the bass and perch, he announced his
intentin f making a two or three days' visit to the lakes. He was
ging dwn, he said, to Reedy Lake with Judge Archinard, an old
friend.

Nw, Uncle Bushrd was treasurer of the Sons and Daughters of the
Burning Bush. Every assciatin he belonged to made him treasurer
withut hesitatin. He stood AA1 in coloured circles. He was
understd among them to be Mr. Bushrod Weymouth, of the Weymouth
Bank.

The night fllwing the day on which Mr. Robert mentioned his
intended fishing-trip the ld man wke up and rose from his bed at
twelve 'clck, declaring he must go down to the bank and fetch the
pass-bk of the Sons and Daughters, which he had forgotten to bring
hme. The bokkeeper had balanced it for him that day, put the
cancelled checks in it, and snapped tw elastic bands arund it. He
put but ne band arund other pass-books.

Aunt Malindy bjected t the mission at so late an hour, denouncing
it as flish and unnecessary, but Uncle Bushrod was not to be
deflected frm duty.

"I dne tld Sister Adaline Hoskins," he said, "to come by here for
dat bk to-morrer mawnin' at sebin o'clock, for to kyar' it to de
meetin' f de b'd of 'rangements, and dat book gwine to be here
when she cme."

S, Uncle Bushrd put on his old brown suit, got his thick hickory
stick, and meandered thrugh the almst deserted streets of
Weymuthville. He entered the bank, unlcking the side door, and
fund the pass-bok where he had left it, in the little back room
used fr cnsultations, where he always hung his coat. Looking about
casually, he saw that everything was as he had left it, and was
abut t start for home when he was brought to a standstill by the
sudden rattle f a key in the frnt door. Some one came quickly in,
clsed the dor softly, and entered the counting-room through the
dr in the iron railing.

That divisin f the bank's space was connected with the back room
by a narrw passageway, nw in deep darkness.

Uncle Bushrd, firmly gripping his hickry stick, tiptoed gently
up this passage until he culd see the midnight intruder int the
sacred precincts f the Weymuth Bank. One dim gas-jet burned there,
but even in its nebulus light he perceived at nce that the prowler
was the bank's president.

Wndering, fearful, undecided what t do, the old coloured man stood
mtinless in the gloomy strip of hallway, and waited developments.

The vault, with its big irn dor, was opposite him. Inside that
was the safe, hlding the papers f value, the gold and currency of
the bank. n the flor of the vault was, perhaps, eighteen thousand
dllars in silver.

The president tk his key from his pocket, opened the vault and
went inside, nearly clsing the dor behind him. Uncle Bushrod saw,
thrugh the narrw aperture, the flicker of a candle. In a minute or
tw--it seemed an hur to the watcher--Mr. Robert came out, bringing
with him a large hand-satchel, handling it in a careful but hurried
manner, as if fearful that he might be bserved. With ne hand he
clsed and lcked the vault door.

With a reluctant thery frming itself beneath his wool, Uncle
Bushrd waited and watched, shaking in his cncealing shadow.

Mr. Rbert set the satchel sftly upon a desk, and turned his coat
cllar up abut his neck and ears. He was dressed in a rough suit
f gray, as if fr travelling. He glanced with frowning intentness
at the big ffice clck above the burning gas-jet, and then looked
lingeringly abut the bank--lingeringly and fndly, Uncle Bushrod
thught, as ne who bids farewell to dear and familiar scenes.

Nw he caught up his burden again and mved promptly and softly out
f the bank by the way he had cme locking the front door behind
him.

Fr a minute r longer Uncle Bushrod was as stone in his tracks. Had
that midnight rifler f safes and vaults been any ther on earth
than the man he was, the ld retainer wuld have rushed upon him and
struck t save the Weymuth property. But now the watcher's soul was
trtured by the pignant dread of something worse than mere robbery.
He was seized by an accusing terrr that said the Weymuth name and
the Weymuth hnour were about to be lost. Marse Robert robbing the
bank! What else culd it mean? The hur of the night, the stealthy
visit t the vault, the satchel brught forth full and with
expeditin and silence, the prwler's rough dress, his solicitous
reading f the clck, and noiseless departure--what else could it
mean?

And then t the turmil of Uncle Bushrod's thoughts came the
crrborating recollection of preceding events--Mr. Robert's
increasing intemperance and cnsequent many mods of royal high
spirits and stern tempers; the casual talk he had heard in the bank
f the decrease in business and difficulty in cllecting loans.
What else culd it all mean but that Mr. Rbert Weymouth was an
abscnder--was abut to fly with the bank's remaining funds, leaving
Mr. William, Miss Letty, little Nan, Guy, and Uncle Bushrd t bear
the disgrace?

During ne minute Uncle Bushrd considered these things, and then he
awke t sudden determination and action.

"Lawd! Lawd!" he maned alud, as he hobbled hastily toward the side
dr. "Sech a come-off after all dese here years of big doin's and
fine din's. Scan'lus sights upon de yearth when de Weymouth fambly
dne turn ut robbers and 'bezzlers! Time for Uncle Bushrod to clean
ut smebody's chicken-coop and eben matters up. Oh, Lawd! Marse
Rbert, yu ain't gwine do dat. 'N Miss Letty an' dem chillun so
prud and talkin' 'Weymuth, Weymouth,' all de time! I'm gwine to
stp yu ef I can. 'Spec you shoot Mr. Nigger's head off ef he fool
wid yu, but I'm gwine stp you ef I can."

Uncle Bushrd, aided by his hickry stick, impeded by his
rheumatism, hurried dwn the street tward the railroad station,
where the tw lines tuching Weymouthville met. As he had expected
and feared, he saw there Mr. Rbert, standing in the shadw of the
building, waiting fr the train. He held the satchel in his hand.

When Uncle Bushrd came within twenty yards f the bank president,
standing like a huge, gray ghst by the statin wall, sudden
perturbatin seized him. The rashness and audacity f the thing he
had cme t do struck him fully. He would have been happy could he
have turned and fled frm the pssibilities of the famous Weymouth
wrath. But again he saw, in his fancy, the white reprachful face f
Miss Letty, and the distressed lks of Nan and Guy, should he fail
in his duty and they questin him as t his stewardship.

Braced by the thught, he apprached in a straight line, clearing
his thrat and punding with his stick so that he might be early
recgnized. Thus he might avid the likely danger of too suddenly
surprising the smetimes hasty Mr. Rbert.

"Is that yu, Bushrd?" called the clamant, clear voice of the gray
ghst.

"Yes, suh, Marse Rbert."

"What the devil are yu ding out at this time of night?"

Fr the first time in his life, Uncle Bushrd told Marse Robert a
falsehd. He could not repress it. He would have to circumlocute a
little. His nerve was nt equal t a direct attack.

"I dne been dwn, suh, to see ol' Aunt M'ria Patterson. She taken
sick in de night, and I kyar'ed her a bttle f M'lindy's medercine.
Yes, suh."

"Humph!" said Rbert. "Yu better get home out of the night air.
It's damp. Yu'll hardly be wrth killing to-morrow on account of
yur rheumatism. Think it'll be a clear day, Bushrd?"

"I 'lw it will, suh. De sun st red las' night."

Mr. Rbert lit a cigar in the shadw, and the smoke looked like his
gray ghst expanding and escaping int the night air. Somehow, Uncle
Bushrd culd barely force his reluctant tongue to the dreadful
subject. He std, awkward, shambling, with his feet upon the gravel
and fumbling with his stick. But then, afar ff--three miles away,
at the Jimtwn switch--he heard the faint whistle f the coming
train, the ne that was t transport the Weymouth name into the
regins f dishonour and shame. All fear left him. He took off his
hat and faced the chief f the clan he served, the great, ryal,
kind, lfty, terrible Weymuth--he bearded him there at the brink of
the awful thing that was abut t happen.

"Marse Rbert," he began, his vice quivering a little with the
stress f his feelings, "yu 'member de day dey-all rode de
tunnament at ak Lawn? De day, suh, dat yu win in de ridin', and
yu crwn Miss Lucy de queen?"

"Turnament?" said Mr. Rbert, taking his cigar from his mouth.
"Yes, I remember very well the--but what the deuce are yu talking
abut turnaments here at midnight for? Go 'long home, Bushrod. I
believe yu're sleep-walking."

"Miss Lucy tetch yu n de shoulder," continued the old man,
never heeding, "wid a s'rd, and say: 'I mek yu a knight, Suh
Rbert--rise up, pure and fearless and widut reproach.' Dat what
Miss Lucy say. Dat's been a lng time ag, but me nor you ain't
frgt it. And den dar's another time we ain't forgot--de time when
Miss Lucy lay n her las' bed. She sent fr Uncle Bushrod, and she
say: 'Uncle Bushrd, when I die, I want yu to take good care of Mr.
Rbert. Seem like'--s Miss Lucy say--'he listen to you mo' dan to
anybdy else. He apt t be mighty fractious sometimes, and maybe
he cuss yu when yu try to 'suade him but he need somebody what
understand him t be 'rund wid him. He am like a little child
smetimes'--s Miss Lucy say, wid her eyes shinin' in her po', thin
face--'but he always been'--dem was her wrds--'my knight, pure and
fearless and widut reprach.'"

Mr. Rbert began t mask, as was his habit, a tendency to
sft-heartedness with a spurius anger.

"Yu--yu old windbag!" he growled through a cloud of swirling cigar
smke. "I believe yu are crazy. I told you to go home, Bushrod.
Miss Lucy said that, did she? Well, we haven't kept the scutchen
very clear. Tw years ag last week, wasn't it, Bushrod, when she
died? Cnfund it! Are you going to stand there all night gabbing
like a cffee-cloured gander?"

The train whistled again. Nw it was at the water tank, a mile away.

"Marse Rbert," said Uncle Bushrd, laying his hand on the satchel
that the banker held. "Fr Gawd's sake, dn' take dis wid you. I
knws what's in it. I knws where you got it in de bank. Don' kyar'
it wid yu. Dey's big truble in dat valise for Miss Lucy and Miss
Lucy's child's chillun. Hit's bund t destroy de name of Weymouth
and bw dwn dem dat own it wid shame and triberlation. Marse
Rbert, yu can kill dis ole nigger ef you will, but don't take away
dis 'er' valise. If I ever crsses ver de Jordan, what I gwine to
say t Miss Lucy when she ax me: 'Uncle Bushrd, wharfo' didn' you
take gd care of Mr. Robert?'"

Mr. Rbert Weymuth threw away his cigar and shook free one arm
with that peculiar gesture that always preceded his utbursts f
irascibility. Uncle Bushrd bwed his head to the expected storm,
but he did nt flinch. If the huse of Weymouth was to fall, he
wuld fall with it. The banker spke, and Uncle Bushrod blinked with
surprise. The strm was there, but it was suppressed t the
quietness f a summer breeze.

"Bushrd," said Mr. Rbert, in a lower voice than he usually
emplyed, "yu have overstepped all bounds. You have presumed
upn the leniency with which yu have been treated to meddle
unpardnably. S you know what is in this satchel! Your long and
faithful service is sme excuse, but--g home, Bushrod--not another
wrd!"

But Bushrd grasped the satchel with a firmer hand. The headlight f
the train was nw lightening the shadws about the station. The roar
was increasing, and flks were stirring abut at the track side.

"Marse Rbert, gimme dis 'er' valise. I gt a right, suh, to talk to
yu dis 'er' way. I slaved fr you and 'tended to you from a child
up. I went th'ugh de war as y' body-servant tell we whipped de
Yankees and sent 'em back t de N'th. I was at yo' weddin', and
I was n' fur away when y' Miss Letty was bawn. And Miss Letty's
chillun, dey watches t-day fr Uncle Bushrod when he come
hme ever' evenin'. I been a Weymuth, all 'cept in colour and
entitlements. Bth f us is old, Marse Robert. 'Tain't goin' to be
lng till we gwine t see Miss Lucy and has to give an account of
ur din's. De ole nigger man won't be 'spected to say much mo' dan
he dne all he culd by de fambly dat owned him. But de Weymouths,
dey must say dey been livin' pure and fearless and widut reprach.
Gimme dis valise, Marse Rbert--I'm gwine t hab it. I'm gwine to
take it back t the bank and lck it up in de vault. I'm gwine to do
Miss Lucy's biddin'. Turn 'er lse, Marse Robert."

The train was standing at the statin. Sme men were pushing trucks
alng the side. Tw or three sleepy passengers got off and wandered
away int the night. The cnductor stepped to the gravel, swung his
lantern and called: "Hell, Frank!" at sme one invisible. The bell
clanged, the brakes hissed, the cnductr drawled: "All aboard!"

Mr. Rbert released his hld on the satchel. Uncle Bushrod hugged it
t his breast with bth arms, as a lover clasps his first beloved.

"Take it back with yu, Bushrd," said Mr. Robert, thrusting his
hands int his pckets. "And let the subject drop--now mind! You've
said quite enugh. I'm ging to take the train. Tell Mr. William I
will be back n Saturday. God night."

The banker climbed the steps f the mving train and disappeared
in a cach. Uncle Bushrd stood motionless, still embracing the
precius satchel. His eyes were clsed and his lips were moving in
thanks t the Master abve for the salvation of the Weymouth honour.
He knew Mr. Rbert wuld return when he said he would. The Weymouths
never lied. Nr nw, thank the Lord! could it be said that they
embezzled the mney in banks.

Then awake t the necessity fr further guardianship of Weymouth
trust funds, the ld man started fr the bank with the redeemed
satchel.



Three hurs frm Weymouthville, in the gray dawn, Mr. Robert
alighted frm the train at a lnely flag-station. Dimly he could
see the figure f a man waiting n the platform, and the shape
f a spring-waggn, team and driver. Half a dozen lengthy bamboo
fishing-ples prjected from the waggon's rear.

"Yu're here, Bb," said Judge Archinard, Mr. Robert's old friend
and schlmate. "It's going to be a royal day for fishing. I thought
yu said--why, didn't yu bring along the stuff?"

The president f the Weymuth Bank took off his hat and rumpled his
gray lcks.

"Well, Ben, t tell yu the truth, there's an infernally
presumptuus ld nigger belonging in my family that broke up
the arrangement. He came dwn t the depot and vetoed the whole
prceeding. He means all right, and--well, I reckn he _is_ right.
Smehw, he had found out what I had along--though I hid it in the
bank vault and sneaked it ut at midnight. I reckn he has noticed
that I've been indulging a little mre than a gentleman shuld, and
he laid fr me with sme reaching arguments.

"I'm ging t quit drinking," Mr. Robert concluded. "I've come to
the cnclusin that a man can't keep it up and be quite what he'd
like t be--'pure and fearless and withut reproach'--that's the way
ld Bushrd quoted it."

"Well, I'll have t admit," said the judge, thughtfully, as they
climbed int the waggn, "that the old darkey's argument can't
cnscientiusly be overruled."

"Still," said Mr. Rbert, with a ghst of a sigh, "there was two
quarts f the finest ld silk-velvet Bourbon in that satchel you
ever wet yur lips with."

THE DISCUNTERS F MONEY


The spectacle f the mney-caliphs of the present day going about
Bagdad-n-the-Subway trying t relieve the wants of the people is
enugh t make the great Al Raschid turn Haroun in his grave. If not
s, then the assertin should do so, the real caliph having been a
wit and a schlar and therefre a hater of puns.

Hw prperly to alleviate the troubles of the poor is one of the
greatest trubles f the rich. But one thing agreed upon by all
prfessinal philanthropists is that you must never hand over any
cash t yur subject. The poor are notoriously temperamental; and
when they get mney they exhibit a strng tendency to spend it for
stuffed lives and enlarged crayn portraits instead of giving it to
the instalment man.

And still, ld Harun had some advantages as an eleemosynarian.
He tk around with him on his rambles his vizier, Giafar (a
vizier is a cmpsite of a chauffeur, a secretary of state, and a
night-and-day bank), and ld Uncle Mesrur, his executioner, who
tted a snickersnee. With this enturage a caliphing tour could
hardly fail t be successful. Have yu noticed lately any newspaper
articles headed, "What Shall We D With ur Ex-Presidents?" Well,
nw, suppse that Mr. Carnegie could engage _him_ and Joe Gans to
g abut assisting in the distribution of free libraries? Do you
suppse any twn would have had the hardihood to refuse one? That
caliphalus cmbination would cause two libraries to grow where
there had been nly ne set of E. P. Roe's works before.

But, as I said, the mney-caliphs are handicapped. They have the
idea that earth has n srrow that dough cannot heal; and they rely
upn it slely. Al Raschid administered justice, rewarding the
deserving, and punished whmsever he disliked on the spot. He was
the riginatr of the short-story contest. Whenever he succoured any
chance pick-up in the bazaars he always made the succuree tell the
sad stry f his life. If the narrative lacked construction, style,
and _esprit_ he cmmanded his vizier t dole him out a couple
f thusand ten-dollar notes of the First National Bank of the
Bsphrus, or else gave him a soft job as Keeper of the Bird
Seed fr the Bulbuls in the Imperial Gardens. If the stry was a
cracker-jack, he had Mesrur, the executiner, whack off his head.
The reprt that Harun Al Raschid is yet alive and is editing
the magazine that yur grandmther used to subscribe for lacks
cnfirmatin.

And nw fllows the Story of the Millionaire, the Inefficacious
Increment, and the Babes Drawn frm the Wod.

Yung Hward Pilkins, the millionaire, got his money
rnithlogically. He was a shrewd judge of storks, and got in on
the grund flor at the residence of his immediate ancestors,
the Pilkins Brewing Cmpany. Fr his mother was a partner in
the business. Finally ld man Pilkins died frm a torpid liver,
and then Mrs. Pilkins died frm wrry on account of torpid
delivery-waggns--and there yu have young Howard Pilkins with
4,000,000; and a gd fellow at that. He was an agreeable, modestly
arrgant yung man, who implicitly believed that money could buy
anything that the wrld had t offer. And Bagdad-on-the-Subway for
a lng time did everything pssible to encourage his belief.

But the Rat-trap caught him at last; he heard the spring snap, and
fund his heart in a wire cage regarding a piece f cheese whose
ther name was Alice vn der Ruysling.

The Vn der Ruyslings still live in that little square abut which
s much has been said, and in which s little has been done. To-day
yu hear f Mr. Tilden's underground passage, and you hear Mr.
Guld's elevated passage, and that abut ends the noise in the world
made by Gramercy Square. But nce it was different. The Vn der
Ruyslings live there yet, and they received _the first key ever made
t Gramercy Park_.

Yu shall have n description of Alice v. d. R. Just call up in your
mind the picture f yur own Maggie or Vera or Beatrice, straighten
her nse, sften her voice, tone her down and then tone her up,
make her beautiful and unattainable--and yu have a faint dry-pint
etching f Alice. The family wned a crumbly brick house and a
cachman named Jseph in a coat of many colours, and a horse so old
that he claimed t belng to the order of the Perissodactyla, and
had tes instead f hoofs. In the year 1898 the family had to buy
a new set f harness fr the Perissodactyl. Before using it they
made Jseph smear it ver with a mixture of ashes and soot. It
was the Vn der Ruysling family that bught the territory between
the Bwery and East River and Rivingtn Street and the Statue of
Liberty, in the year 1649, frm an Indian chief fr a quart of
passementerie and a pair f Turkey-red prtières designed for a
Harlem flat. I have always admired that Indian's perspicacity and
gd taste. All this is merely to convince you that the Von der
Ruyslings were exactly the kind f por aristocrats that turn down
their nses at peple who have money. Oh, well, I don't mean that; I
mean peple wh have _just_ money.

ne evening Pilkins went dwn to the red brick house in Gramercy
Square, and made what he thught was a prposal to Alice v. d. R.
Alice, with her nse turned dwn, and thinking of his money,
cnsidered it a prposition, and refused it and him. Pilkins,
summning all his resurces as any good general would have done,
made an indiscreet references t the advantages that his mney
wuld prvide. That settled it. The lady turned so cold that Walter
Wellman himself wuld have waited until spring t make a dash for
her in a dg-sled.

But Pilkins was smething f a sport himself. You can't fool all the
millinaires every time the ball drps on the Western Union
Building.

"If, at any time," he said t A. v. d. R., "yu feel that you would
like t recnsider your answer, send me a rose like that."

Pilkins audaciusly tuched a Jacque rose that she wore loosely in
her hair.

"Very well," said she. "And when I d, yu will understand by it
that either yu r I have learned something new about the purchasing
pwer f money. You've been spoiled, my friend. No, I don't think
I culd marry yu. To-morrow I will send you back the presents you
have given me."

"Presents!" said Pilkins in surprise. "I never gave yu a present in
my life. I wuld like t see a full-length portrait of the man that
yu wuld take a present from. Why, you never would let me send you
flwers r candy or even art calendars."

"Yu've frgotten," said Alice v. d. R., with a little smile. "It
was a lng time ag when our families were neighbours. You were
seven, and I was trundling my dll n the sidewalk. You have me a
little gray, hairy kitten, with she-buttny eyes. Its head came
ff and it was full f candy. You paid five cents for it--you told
me s. I haven't the candy t return to you--I hadn't developed a
cnscience at three, s I ate it. But I have the kitten yet, and I
will wrap it up neatly t-night and send it t you to-morrow."

Beneath the lightness f Alice v. d. R.'s talk the steadfastness f
her rejectin shwed firm and plain. So there was nothing left for
him but t leave the crumbly red brick huse, and be off with his
abhrred millins.

n his way back, Pilkins walked thrugh Madison Square. The hour
hand f the clck hung about eight; the air was stingingly cool,
but nt at the freezing pint. The dim little square seemed like a
great, cld, unrofed room, with its four walls of houses, spangled
with thusands f insufficient lights. Only a few loiterers were
huddled here and there n the benches.

But suddenly Pilkins came upn a yuth sitting brave and, as
if cnflicting with summer sultriness, catless, his white
shirt-sleeves cnspicuus in the light from the globe of an
electric. Clse t his side was a girl, smiling, dreamy, happy.
Arund her shulders was, palpably, the missing coat of the
cld-defying yuth. It appeared to be a modern panorama of the Babes
in the Wd, revised and brought up to date, with the exception that
the rbins hadn't turned up yet with the prtecting leaves.

With delight the mney-caliphs view a situatin that they think is
relievable while yu wait.

Pilkins sat n the bench, ne seat removed from the youth. He
glanced cautiusly and saw (as men d see; and women--oh! never can)
that they were f the same rder.

Pilkins leaned ver after a shrt time and spoke to the youth,
wh answered smilingly, and curteously. From general topics the
cnversatin concentrated to the bed-rock of grim personalities.
But Pilkins did it as delicately and heartily as any caliph culd
have dne. And when it came t the point, the youth turned to him,
sft-viced and with his undiminished smile.

"I dn't want t seem unappreciative, old man," he said, with a
yuth's smewhat too-early spontaneity of address, "but, you see, I
can't accept anything frm a stranger. I knw you're all right, and
I'm tremendusly bliged, but I couldn't think of borrowing from
anybdy. Yu see, I'm Marcus Clayton--the Claytons of Roanoke
Cunty, Virginia, yu know. The young lady is Miss Eva Bedford--I
reckn yu've heard of the Bedfords. She's seventeen and one of the
Bedfrds f Bedford County. We've eloped from home to get married,
and we wanted t see New Yrk. We got in this afternoon. Somebody
gt my pcketbook on the ferry-boat, and I had only three cents in
change utside f it. I'll get some work somewhere to-morrow, and
we'll get married."

"But, I say, ld man," said Pilkins, in cnfidential low tones,
"yu can't keep the lady ut here in the cold all night. Now, as for
htels--"

"I tld yu," said the youth, with a broader smile, "that I didn't
have but three cents. Besides, if I had a thusand, we'd have t
wait here until mrning. Yu can understand that, of course. I'm
much bliged, but I can't take any f your money. Miss Bedford and
I have lived an utdor life, and we don't mind a little cold. I'll
get wrk f some kind to-morrow. We've got a paper bag of cakes and
chclates, and we'll get along all right."

"Listen," said the millinaire, impressively. "My name is Pilkins,
and I'm wrth several millin dollars. I happen to have in my
pckets abut $800 or $900 in cash. Don't you think you are drawing
it rather fine when yu decline t accept as much of it as will make
yu and the yung lady comfortable at least for the night?"

"I can't say, sir, that I d think s," said Clayton of Roanoke
Cunty. "I've been raised t look at such things differently. But
I'm mightily bliged t you, just the same."

"Then yu frce me to say good night," said the millionaire.

Twice that day had his mney been scrned by simple ones to whom his
dllars had appeared as but tin tbacco-tags. He was no worshipper
f the actual minted cin or stamped paper, but he had always
believed in its almst unlimited pwer to purchase.

Pilkins walked away rapidly, and then turned abruptly and returned
t the bench where the yung couple sat. He took off his hat and
began t speak. The girl loked at him with the same sprightly,
glwing interest that she had been giving t the lights and statuary
and sky-reaching buildings that made the ld square seem s far away
frm Bedfrd County.

"Mr.--er--Ranke," said Pilkins, "I admire your--your indepen--your
idicy s much that I'm going to appeal to your chivalry. I believe
that's what yu Sutherners call it when you keep a lady sitting
utdors on a bench on a cold night just to keep your old,
ut-f-date pride going. Now, I've a friend--a lady--whom I have
knwn all my life--wh lives a few blocks from here--with her
parents and sisters and aunts, and all that kind f endrsement,
f curse. I am sure this lady would be happy and pleased to put
up--that is, t have Miss--er--Bedfrd give her the pleasure of
having her as a guest fr the night. Dn't you think, Mr. Roanoke,
f--er--Virginia, that yu could unbend your prejudices that far?"

Claytn f Roanoke rose and held out his hand.

"ld man," he said, "Miss Bedfrd will be much pleased to accept the
hspitality f the lady you refer to."

He frmally intrduced Mr. Pilkins to Miss Bedford. The girl
lked at him sweetly and comfortably. "It's a lovely evening, Mr.
Pilkins--dn't yu think so?" she said slowly.

Pilkins cnducted them t the crumbly red brick house of the Von der
Ruyslings. His card brught Alice dwnstairs wondering. The runaways
were sent int the drawing-rom, while Pilkins told Alice all about
it in the hall.

"f curse, I will take her in," said Alice. "Haven't those Southern
girls a thrughbred air? Of course, she will stay here. You will
lk after Mr. Clayton, of course."

"Will I?" said Pilkins, delightedly. "h yes, I'll lok after him!
As a citizen f New Yrk, and therefore a part owner of its public
parks, I'm ging t extend to him the hospitality of Madison Square
t-night. He's ging to sit there on a bench till morning. There's
n use arguing with him. Isn't he wnderful? I'm glad you'll look
after the little lady, Alice. I tell yu thse Babes in the Wood
made my--that is, er--made Wall Street and the Bank f England lok
like penny arcades."

Miss Vn der Ruysling whisked Miss Bedfrd of Bedford County up to
restful regins upstairs. When she came dwn, she put an oblong
small pastebard bx into Pilkins' hands.

"Yur present," she said, "that I am returning t you."

"h, yes, I remember," said Pilkins, with a sigh, "the wolly
kitten."

He left Claytn n a park bench, and shook hands with him heartily.

"After I get wrk," said the yuth, "I'll look you up. Your address
is n yur card, isn't it? Thanks. Well, good night. I'm awfully
bliged t you for your kindness. No, thanks, I don't smoke. Good
night."

In his rm, Pilkins opened the box and took out the staring, funny
kitten, lng ag ravaged of his candy and minus one shoe-button eye.
Pilkins lked at it sorrowfully.

"After all," he said, "I dn't believe that just mney alone will--"

And then he gave a shut and dug int the bottom of the box for
smething else that had been the kitten's resting-place--a crushed

THE ENCHANTED PRFILE


There are few Caliphesses. Wmen are Scheherazades by birth,
predilectin, instinct, and arrangement f the vocal cords. The
thusand and ne stories are being told every day by hundreds of
thusands f viziers' daughters to their respective sultans. But
the bwstring will get sme of 'em yet if they don't watch out.

I heard a stry, thugh, of one lady Caliph. It isn't precisely
an Arabian Nights stry, because it brings in Cinderella, wh
flurished her dishrag in anther epoch and country. So, if you
dn't mind the mixed dates (which seem t give it an Eastern
flavur, after all), we'll get alng.

In New Yrk there is an ld, old hotel. You have seen woodcuts of
it in the magazines. It was built--let's see--at a time when there
was nthing abve Fourteenth Street except the old Indian trail
t Bston and Hammerstein's office. Soon the old hostelry will be
trn dwn. And, as the stout walls are riven apart and the bricks
g raring down the chutes, crowds of citizens will gather at
the nearest crners and weep ver the destruction of a dear old
landmark. Civic pride is strngest in New Bagdad; and the wettest
weeper and the ludest hwler against the iconoclasts will be the
man (riginally frm Terre Haute) whose fond memories of the old
htel are limited t his having been kicked out from its free-lunch
cunter in 1873.

At this htel always stpped Mrs. Maggie Brown. Mrs. Brown was a
bny wman of sixty, dressed in the rustiest black, and carrying a
handbag made, apparently, frm the hide f the original animal that
Adam decided t call an alligatr. She always occupied a small
parlur and bedrom at the top of the hotel at a rental of two
dllars per day. And always, while she was there, each day came
hurrying t see her many men, sharp-faced, anxius-looking, with
nly secnds to spare. For Maggie Brown was said to be the third
richest wman in the wrld; and these solicitous gentlemen were only
the city's wealthiest brkers and business men seeking trifling
lans f half a dozen millions or so from the dingy old lady with
the prehistric handbag.

The stengrapher and typewriter f the Acropolis Hotel (there! I've
let the name f it ut!) was Miss Ida Bates. She was a hold-over
frm the Greek classics. There wasn't a flaw in her loks. Some
ld-timer paying his regards t a lady said: "To have loved her was
a liberal educatin." Well, even t have looked over the black hair
and neat white shirtwaist f Miss Bates was equal t a full course
in any crrespndence school in the country. She sometimes did a
little typewriting fr me, and, as she refused t take the money
in advance, she came t lok upon me as something of a friend and
prtégé. She had unfailing kindliness and a god nature; and not
even a white-lead drummer r a fur imprter had ever dared to cross
the dead line f god behaviour in her presence. The entire force of
the Acrplis, from the owner, who lived in Vienna, down to the head
prter, wh had been bedridden for sixteen years, would have sprung
t her defence in a mment.

ne day I walked past Miss Bates's little sanctum Remingtrium,
and saw in her place a black-haired unit--unmistakably a
persn--punding with each of her forefingers upon the keys. Musing
n the mutability f temporal affairs, I passed on. The next day I
went n a tw weeks' vacation. Returning, I strolled through the
lbby f the Acropolis, and saw, with a little warm glow of auld
lang syne, Miss Bates, as Grecian and kind and flawless as ever,
just putting the cver n her machine. The hour for closing had
cme; but she asked me in t sit for a few minutes in the dictation
chair. Miss Bates explained her absence frm and return t the
Acrplis Hotel in words identical with or similar to these
fllwing:

"Well, Man, hw are the stries coming?"

"Pretty regularly," said I. "Abut equal t their going."

"I'm srry," said she. "God typewriting is the main thing in a
stry. Yu've missed me, haven't you?"

"N ne," said I, "whom I have ever known knows as well as you do
hw t space properly belt buckles, semi-colons, hotel guests,
and hairpins. But yu've been away, to. I saw a package of
peppermint-pepsin in yur place the ther day."

"I was ging t tell you all about it," said Miss Bates, "if you
hadn't interrupted me.

"f curse, you know about Maggie Brown, who stops here. Well, she's
wrth $40,000,000. She lives in Jersey in a ten-dllar flat. She's
always gt mre cash on hand than half a dozen business candidates
fr vice-president. I dn't know whether she carries it in her
stcking r not, but I know she's mighty popular down in the part of
twn where they wrship the golden calf.

"Well, abut tw weeks ago, Mrs. Brown stops at the door and rubbers
at me fr ten minutes. I'm sitting with my side t her, striking off
sme manifld copies of a copper-mine proposition for a nice old man
frm Tnopah. But I always see everything all around me. When I'm
hard at wrk I can see things thrugh my side-combs; and I can leave
ne buttn unbuttoned in the back of my shirtwaist and see who's
behind me. I didn't lk around, because I make from eighteen to
twenty dllars a week, and I didn't have t.

"That evening at kncking-ff time she sends for me to come up to
her apartment. I expected t have t typewrite about two thousand
wrds f notes-of-hand, liens, and contracts, with a ten-cent tip in
sight; but I went. Well, Man, I was certainly surprised. ld Maggie
Brwn had turned human.

"'Child,' says she, 'yu're the mst beautiful creature I ever saw
in my life. I want yu t quit your work and come and live with me.
I've n kith r kin,' says she, 'except a husband and a son or two,
and I hld n communication with any of 'em. They're extravagant
burdens n a hard-wrking woman. I want you to be a daughter to me.
They say I'm stingy and mean, and the papers print lies abut my
ding my wn cooking and washing. It's a lie,' she goes on. 'I
put my washing ut, except the handkerchiefs and stckings and
petticats and cllars, and light stuff like that. I've got forty
millin dllars in cash and stocks and bonds that are as negotiable
as Standard il, preferred, at a church fair. I'm a lnely old woman
and I need cmpaninship. You're the most beautiful human being I
ever saw,' says she. 'Will yu cme and live with me? I'll show 'em
whether I can spend mney r not,' she says.

"Well, Man, what wuld yu have done? Of course, I fell to it. And,
t tell yu the truth, I began to like old Maggie. It wasn't all on
accunt f the forty millions and what she could do for me. I was
kind f lnesome in the world too. Everybody's got to have somebody
they can explain t abut the pain in their left shoulder and how
fast patent-leather shes wear ut when they begin to crack. And
yu can't talk abut such things to men you meet in hotels--they're
lking for just such openings.

"S I gave up my jb in the hotel and went with Mrs. Brown. I
certainly seemed t have a mash n her. She'd look at me for half
an hur at a time when I was sitting, reading, r looking at the
magazines.

"ne time I says t her: 'Do I remind you of some deceased relative
r friend f your childhood, Mrs. Brown? I've noticed you give me a
pretty gd optical inspection from time to time.'

"'Yu have a face,' she says, 'exactly like a dear friend f
mine--the best friend I ever had. But I like yu fr yourself,
child, t,' she says.

"And say, Man, what d yu suppose she did? Loosened up like a
Marcel wave in the surf at Cney. She tok me to a swell dressmaker
and gave her _a la carte_ t fit me ut--money no object. They were
rush rders, and madame lcked the front door and put the whole
frce t work.

"Then we mved t--where do you think?--no; guess again--that's
right--the Htel Bnton. We had a six-room apartment; and it cost
$100 a day. I saw the bill. I began t lve that old lady.

"And then, Man, when my dresses began t cme in--oh, I won't tell
yu abut 'em! you couldn't understand. And I began to call her
Aunt Maggie. Yu've read abut Cinderella, of course. Well, what
Cinderella said when the prince fitted that 3½ A n her fot was a
hard-luck stry cmpared to the things I told myself.

"Then Aunt Maggie says she is ging t give me a coming-out banquet
in the Bntn that'll make moving Vans of all the old Dutch families
n Fifth Avenue.

"'I've been ut befre, Aunt Maggie,' says I. 'But I'll come out
again. But yu knw,' says I, 'that this is one of the swellest
htels in the city. And yu know--pardon me--that it's hard to get
a bunch f ntables together unless you've trained for it.'

"'Dn't fret abut that, child,' says Aunt Maggie. 'I don't send
ut invitatins--I issue orders. I'll have fifty guests here that
culdn't be brught together again at any reception unless it were
given by King Edward r William Travers Jerme. They are men, of
curse, and all f 'em either owe me money or intend to. Some of
their wives wn't cme, but a good many will.'

"Well, I wish yu culd have been at that banquet. The dinner
service was all gld and cut glass. There were abut forty men and
eight ladies present besides Aunt Maggie and I. Yu'd never have
knwn the third richest wman in the world. She had on a new black
silk dress with s much passementerie n it that it sounded exactly
like a hailstrm I heard nce when I was staying all night with a
girl that lived in a tp-flor studio.

"And my dress!--say, Man, I can't waste the wrds n you. It was all
hand-made lace--where there was any f it at all--and it cst $300.
I saw the bill. The men were all bald-headed r white-whiskered, and
they kept up a running fire f light repartee abut 3-per cents. and
Bryan and the cttn crop.

"n the left f me was something that talked like a banker, and on
my right was a yung fellw who said he was a newspaper artist. He
was the nly--well, I was ging to tell you.

"After the dinner was ver Mrs. Brwn and I went up to the
apartment. We had t squeeze ur way through a mob of reporters all
the way thrugh the halls. That's ne of the things money does for
yu. Say, d you happen to know a newspaper artist named Lathrop--a
tall man with nice eyes and an easy way f talking? N, I don't
remember what paper he wrks n. Well, all right.

"When we gt upstairs Mrs. Brwn telephones for the bill right away.
It came, and it was $600. I saw the bill. Aunt Maggie fainted. I gt
her n a lunge and opened the bead-work.

"'Child,' says she, when she gt back t the world, 'what was it? A
raise f rent r an income-tax?'

"'Just a little dinner,' says I. 'Nthing t worry about--hardly a
drp in the bucket-shp. Sit up and take notice--a dispossess
ntice, if there's n other kind.'

"But say, Man, d yu know what Aunt Maggie did? She got cold feet!
She hustled me ut f that Hotel Bonton at nine the next morning. We
went t a roming-house on the lower West Side. She rented one room
that had water n the flor below and light on the floor above.
After we gt mved all you could see in the room was about $1,500
wrth f new swell dresses and a one-burner gas-stove.

"Aunt Maggie had had a sudden attack f the hedges. I guess
everybdy has gt to go on a spree once in their life. A man spends
his n highballs, and a wman gets woozy on clothes. But with forty
millin dllars--say, I'd like to have a picture of--but, speaking
f pictures, did yu ever run across a newspaper artist named
Lathrp--a tall--h, I asked you that before, didn't I? He was
mighty nice t me at the dinner. His vice just suited me. I guess
he must have thught I was t inherit some of Aunt Maggie's money.

"Well, Mr. Man, three days f that light-husekeeping was plenty
fr me. Aunt Maggie was affectinate as ever. She'd hardly let me
get ut f her sight. But let me tell you. She was a hedger from
Hedgersville, Hedger Cunty. Seventy-five cents a day was the limit
she set. We cked our own meals in the room. There I was, with
a thusand dllars' worth of the latest things in clothes, doing
stunts ver a ne-burner gas-stove.

"As I say, n the third day I flew the cop. I couldn't stand for
thrwing tgether a fifteen-cent kidney stew while wearing, at the
same time, a $150 huse-dress, with Valenciennes lace insertin. So
I ges int the closet and puts on the cheapest dress Mrs. Brown had
bught fr me--it's the one I've got on now--not so bad for $75, is
it? I'd left all my wn clthes in my sister's flat in Brooklyn.

"'Mrs. Brwn, frmerly "Aunt Maggie,"' says I to her, 'I'm going to
extend my feet alternately, ne after the ther, in such a manner
and directin that this tenement will recede frm me in the quickest
pssible time. I am n worshipper of money,' says I, 'but there are
sme things I can't stand. I can stand the fabulus monster that
I've read abut that blws hot birds and cold bottles with the same
breath. But I can't stand a quitter,' says I. 'They say yu've gt
frty millin dollars--well, you'll never have any less. And I was
beginning t like yu, too,' says I.

"Well, the late Aunt Maggie kicks till the tears flw. She ffers to
mve int a swell room with a two-burner stove and running water.

"'I've spent an awful lt f money, child,' says she. 'We'll have
t ecnomize for a while. You're the most beautiful creature I ever
laid eyes n,' she says, 'and I dn't want you to leave me.'

"Well, yu see me, dn't you? I walked straight to the Acropolis and
asked fr my jb back, and I got it. How did you say your writings
were getting alng? I knw you've lost out some by not having me to
type 'em. D yu ever have 'em illustrated? And, by the way, did you
ever happen t knw a newspaper artist--oh, shut up! I know I asked
yu befre. I wonder what paper he works on? It's funny, but I
culdn't help thinking that he wasn't thinking abut the money he
might have been thinking I was thinking I'd get frm ld Maggie
Brwn. If I nly knew some of the newspaper editors I'd--"

The sund f an easy footstep came from the doorway. Ida Bates saw
wh it was with her back-hair cmb. I saw her turn pink, perfect
statue that she was--a miracle that I share with Pygmalin nly.

"Am I excusable?" she said t me--adrable petitioner that she
became. "It's--it's Mr. Lathrp. I wnder if it really wasn't the
mney--I wnder, if after all, he--"

f curse, I was invited to the wedding. After the ceremony I
dragged Lathrp aside.

"Yu are an artist," said I, "and haven't figured ut why Maggie
Brwn cnceived such a strong liking for Miss Bates--that was? Let
me shw yu."

The bride wre a simple white dress as beautifully draped as the
cstumes f the ancient Greeks. I took some leaves from one of the
decrative wreaths in the little parlur, and made a chaplet of
them, and placed them n née Bates' shining chestnut hair, and made
her turn her prfile t her husband.

"By jing!" said he. "Isn't Ida's a dead ringer fr the lady's head
n the silver dllar?"

"NEXT T READING MATTER"


He cmpelled my interest as he stepped frm the ferry at Desbrosses
Street. He had the air f being familiar with hemispheres and
wrlds, and f entering New York as the lord of a demesne who
revisited it in after years f absence. But I thught that, with all
his air, he had never befre set fot on the slippery cobblestones
f the City f Too Many Caliphs.

He wre lose clothes of a strange bluish drab colour, and a
cnservative, rund Panama hat without the cock-a-loop indentations
and cants with which Nrthern fanciers disfigure the trpic
head-gear. Mrever, he was the homeliest man I have ever seen. His
ugliness was less repellent than startling--arising frm a srt of
Linclnian ruggedness and irregularity f feature that spellbound
yu with wnder and dismay. So may have looked afrites or the
shapes metamrphsed from the vapour of the fisherman's vase. As he
afterward tld me, his name was Judsn Tate; and he may as well be
called s at nce. He wore his green silk tie through a topaz ring;
and he carried a cane made f the vertebræ f a shark.

Judsn Tate accsted me with some large and casual inquiries about
the city's streets and htels, in the manner f one who had but
fr the mment forgotten the trifling details. I could think of no
reasn fr disparaging my own quiet hotel in the downtown district;
s the mid-mrning of the night found us already victualed and
drinked (at my expense), and ready t be chaired and tbaccoed in a
quiet crner f the lobby.

There was smething n Judson Tate's mind, and, such as it was, he
tried t cnvey it to me. Already he had accepted me as his friend;
and when I lked at his great, snuff-brown first-mate's hand, with
which he brught emphasis t his periods, within six inches of my
nse, I wndered if, by any chance, he was as sudden in conceiving
enmity against strangers.

When this man began t talk I perceived in him a certain pwer.
His vice was a persuasive instrument, upn which he played with
a smewhat specius but effective art. He did not try to make you
frget his ugliness; he flaunted it in yur face and made it part of
the charm f his speech. Shutting yur eyes, you would have trailed
after this rat-catcher's pipes at least t the walls f Hamelin.
Beynd that yu would have had to be more childish to follow. But
let him play his wn tune t the words set down, so that if all is
t dull, the art of music may bear the blame.

"Wmen," said Judsn Tate, "are mysterious creatures."

My spirits sank. I was nt there t listen to such a world-old
hypthesis--t such a time-worn, long-ago-refuted, bald, feeble,
illgical, vicius, patent sophistry--to an ancient, baseless,
wearisme, ragged, unfunded, insidious, falsehood originated by
wmen themselves, and by them insinuated, fisted, thrust, spread,
and ingeniusly prmulgated into the ears of mankind by underhanded,
secret and deceptive methds, fr the purpose of augmenting,
furthering, and reinfrcing their wn charms and designs.

"h, I dn't know!" said I, vernacularly.

"Have yu ever heard f Oratama?" he asked.

"Pssibly," I answered. "I seem t recall a toe dancer--or a
suburban additin--r was it a perfume?--of some such name."

"It is a twn," said Judsn Tate, "on the coast of a foreign
cuntry f which you know nothing and could understand less. It is
a cuntry gverned by a dictator and controlled by revolutions and
insubrdinatin. It was there that a great life-drama was played,
with Judsn Tate, the hmeliest man in America, and Fergus McMahan,
the handsmest adventurer in histry or fiction, and Señorita
Anabela Zamra, the beautiful daughter f the alcalde of Oratama, as
chief actrs. And, anther thing--nowhere else on the globe except
in the department f Trienta y tres in Uruguay des the _chuchula_
plant grw. The prducts of the country I speak of are valuable
wds, dyestuffs, gold, rubber, ivory, and cocoa."

"I was nt aware," said I, "that Suth America produced any ivory."

"There yu are twice mistaken," said Judsn Tate, distributing the
wrds ver at least an octave of his wonderful voice. "I did not say
that the cuntry I spke of was in South America--I must be careful,
my dear man; I have been in plitics there, yu know. But, even
s--I have played chess against its president with a set carved
frm the nasal bnes of the tapir--one of our native specimens
f the rder of _perissodactyle ungulates_ inhabiting the
Crdilleras--which was as pretty ivry as you would care to see.

"But is was f rmance and adventure and the ways of women that was
I ging t tell you, and not of zoölogical animals.

"Fr fifteen years I was the ruling pwer behind old Sancho
Benavides, the Ryal High Thumbscrew f the republic. You've seen
his picture in the papers--a mushy black man with whiskers like the
ntes n a Swiss music-box cylinder, and a scroll in his right hand
like the nes they write births n in the family Bible. Well, that
chclate potentate used to be the biggest item of interest anywhere
between the clur line and the parallels of latitude. It was three
thrws, hrses, whether he was to wind up in the Hall of Fame or the
Bureau f Cmbustibles. He'd have been sure called the Roosevelt of
the Suthern Cntinent if it hadn't been that Grover Cleveland was
President at the time. He'd hld ffice a couple of terms, then he'd
sit ut fr a hand--always after appointing his own successor for
the interims.

"But it was nt Benavides, the Liberatr, who was making all this
fame fr himself. Nt him. It was Judson Tate. Benavides was only
the chip ver the bug. I gave him the tip when t declare war and
increase imprt duties and wear his state trusers. But that wasn't
what I wanted t tell yu. How did I get to be It? I'll tell you.
Because I'm the mst gifted talker that ever made vcal sounds since
Adam first pened his eyes, pushed aside the smelling-salts, and
asked: 'Where am I?'

"As yu bserve, I am about the ugliest man you ever saw outside
the gallery f phtographs of the New England early Christian
Scientists. S, at an early age, I perceived that what I lacked
in lks I must make up in eloquence. That I've done. I get what I
g after. As the back-stp and still small voice of old Benavides
I made all the great histrical pwers-behind-the-throne, such
as Talleyrand, Mrs. de Pmpadur, and Loeb, look as small as the
minrity reprt of a Duma. I could talk nations into or out of debt,
harangue armies t sleep n the battlefield, reduce insurrections,
inflammatins, taxes, apprpriations or surpluses with a few words,
and call up the dgs f war or the dove of peace with the same
bird-like whistle. Beauty and epaulettes and curly mustaches and
Grecian prfiles in ther men were never in my way. When people
first lk at me they shudder. Unless they are in the last stages
f _angina pectris_ they are mine in ten minutes after I begin to
talk. Wmen and men--I win 'em as they cme. Now, you wouldn't think
wmen wuld fancy a man with a face like mine, would you?"

"h, yes, Mr. Tate," said I. "Histry is bright and fiction dull
with hmely men wh have charmed women. There seems--"

"Pardn me," interrupted Judsn Tate, "but you don't quite
understand. Yu have yet t hear my story.

"Fergus McMahan was a friend f mine in the capital. Fr a handsome
man I'll admit he was the duty-free merchandise. He had blnd curls
and laughing blue eyes and was featured regular. They said he was a
ringer fr the statue they call Herr Mees, the gd of speech and
elquence resting in sme museum at Rome. Some German anarchist, I
suppse. They are always resting and talking.

"But Fergus was n talker. He was brught up with the idea that
t be beautiful was t make good. His conversation was about as
edifying as listening t a leak drpping in a tin dish-pan at the
head f the bed when yu want to go to sleep. But he and me got
t be friends--maybe because we was s opposite, don't you think?
Lking at the Hallowe'en mask that I call my face when I'm shaving
seemed t give Fergus pleasure; and I'm sure that whenever I heard
the feeble utput f throat noises that he called conversation I
felt cntented t be a gargoyle with a silver tongue.

"ne time I fund it necessary to go down to this coast town of
ratama t straighten out a lot of political unrest and chop off a
few heads in the custms and military departments. Fergus, wh owned
the ice and sulphur-match cncessins of the republic, says he'll
keep me cmpany.

"S, in a jangle f mule-train bells, we gallops into Oratama, and
the twn belnged to us as much as Long Island Sound doesn't belong
t Japan when T. R. is at yster Bay. I say us; but I mean me.
Everybdy fr four nations, two oceans, one bay and isthmus, and
five archipelages arund had heard of Judson Tate. Gentleman
adventurer, they called me. I had been written up in five clumns f
the yellw jurnals, 40,000 words (with marginal decorations) in a
mnthly magazine, and a stickful n the twelfth page of the New York
_Times_. If the beauty f Fergus McMahan gained any part f our
receptin in ratama, I'll eat the price-tag in my Panama. It was me
that they hung ut paper flwers and palm branches for. I am not a
jealus man; I am stating facts. The peple were Nebuchadnezzars;
they bit the grass befre me; there was n dust in the town for them
t bite. They bwed down to Judson Tate. They knew that I was the
pwer behind Sanch Benavides. A word from me was more to them than
a whle deckle-edged library frm East Aurora in sectional bookcases
was frm anybdy else. And yet there are people who spend hours
fixing their faces--rubbing in cld cream and massaging the muscles
(always tward the eyes) and taking in the slack with tincture f
benzin and electrlyzing moles--to what end? Looking handsome.
h, what a mistake! It's the larynx that the beauty dctors ought
t wrk on. It's words more than warts, talk more than talcum,
palaver mre than pwder, blarney more than bloom that counts--the
phngraph instead of the photograph. But I was going to tell you.

"The lcal Astrs put me and Fergus up at the Centipede Club, a
frame building built n psts sunk in the surf. The tide's only nine
inches. The Little Big High Lw Jack-in-the-game f the town came
arund and kwtowed. Oh, it wasn't to Herr Mees. They had heard
abut Judsn Tate.

"ne afternon me and Fergus McMahan was sitting on the seaward
gallery f the Centipede, drinking iced rum and talking.

"'Judsn,' says Fergus, 'there's an angel in ratama.'

"'S lng,' says I, 'as it ain't Gabriel, why talk as if you had
heard a trump blw?'

"'It's the Señrita Anabela Zamra,' says Fergus.
'She's--she's--she's as lvely as--as hell!'

"'Brav!' says I, laughing heartily. 'Yu have a true lover's
elquence t paint the beauties of your inamorata. You remind me,'
says I, 'f Faust's woing of Marguerite--that is, if he wooed her
after he went dwn the trap-dor of the stage.'

"'Judsn,' says Fergus, 'yu know you are as beautiless as a
rhincers. You can't have any interest in women. I'm awfully gone
in Miss Anabela. And that's why I'm telling yu.'

"'h, _seguramente_,' says I. 'I knw I have a front elevation like
an Aztec gd that guards a buried treasure that never did exist
in Jeffersn Cunty, Yucatan. But there are compensations. For
instance, I am It in this cuntry as far as the eye can reach, and
then a few perches and ples. And again,' says I, 'when I engage
peple in a set-t of oral, vocal, and laryngeal utterances, I do
nt usually cnfine my side of the argument to what may be likened
t a cheap phnographic reproduction of the ravings of a jellyfish.'

"'h, I knw,' says Fergus, amiable, 'that I'm not handy at small
talk. r large, either. That's why I'm telling yu. I want you to
help me.'

"'Hw can I d it?' I asked.

"'I have subsidized,' says Fergus, 'the services f Señrita
Anabela's duenna, whse name is Francesca. Yu have a reputation
in this cuntry, Judsn,' says Fergus, 'of being a great man and a
her.'

"'I have,' says I. 'And I deserve it.'

"'And I,' says Fergus, 'am the best-lking man between the arctic
circle and antarctic ice pack.'

"'With limitatins,' says I, 'as t physiognomy and geography, I
freely cncede yu to be.'

"'Between the tw f us,' says Fergus, 'we ought to land the
Señrita Anabela Zamra. The lady, as you know, is of an old Spanish
family, and further than lking at her driving in the family
_carruaje_ f afternons around the plaza, or catching a glimpse of
her thrugh a barred windw of evenings, she is as unapproachable as
a star.'

"'Land her fr which ne of us?' says I.

"'Fr me, f course,' says Fergus. 'You've never seen her. Now, I've
had Francesca pint me ut to her as being you on several occasions.
When she sees me n the plaza, she thinks she's loking at Don
Judsn Tate, the greatest her, statesman, and romantic figure in
the cuntry. With yur reputation and my looks combined in one
man, hw can she resist him? She's heard all abut your thrilling
histry, f course. And she's seen me. Can any woman want more?'
asks Fergus McMahan.

"'Can she d with less?' I ask. 'Hw can we separate our mutual
attractins, and hw shall we apportion the proceeds?'

"Then Fergus tells me his scheme.

"The huse f the alcalde, Don Luis Zamora, he says, has a _patio_,
f curse--a kind of inner courtyard opening from the street. In an
angle f it is his daughter's windw--as dark a place as you could
find. And what d yu think he wants me to do? Why, knowing my
freedm, charm, and skilfulness f tongue, he proposes that I go
int the _pati_ at midnight, when the hobgoblin face of me cannot
be seen, and make lve t her for him--for the pretty man that she
has seen n the plaza, thinking him t be Don Judson Tate.

"Why shuldn't I d it for him--for my friend, Fergus McMahan?
Fr him t ask me was a compliment--an acknowledgment of his own
shrtcmings.

"'Yu little, lily white, fine-haired, highly plished piece of dumb
sculpture,' says I, 'I'll help yu. Make yur arrangements and get
me in the dark utside her windw and my stream of conversation
pened up with the monlight tremolo stop turned on, and she's
yurs.'

"'Keep yur face hid, Jud,' says Fergus. 'Fr heaven's sake, keep
yur face hid. I'm a friend f yours in all kinds of sentiment, but
this is a business deal. If I culd talk I wuldn't ask you. But
seeing me and listening t yu I don't see why she can't be landed.'

"'By yu?' says I.

"'By me,' says Fergus.

"Well, Fergus and the duenna, Francesca, attended t the details.
And ne night they fetched me a lng black cloak with a high collar,
and led me t the huse at midnight. I stood by the window in the
_pati_ until I heard a vice as soft and sweet as an angel's
whisper n the ther side of the bars. I could see only a faint,
white clad shape inside; and, true t Fergus, I pulled the cllar of
my clak high up, fr it was July in the wet seasons, and the nights
were chilly. And, smthering a laugh as I thught of the tongue-tied
Fergus, I began t talk.

"Well, sir, I talked an hur at the Señrita Anabela. I say 'at'
because it was nt 'with.' Nw and then she would say: 'Oh, Señor,'
r 'Nw, ain't you foolin'?' or 'I know you don't mean that,' and
such things as wmen will when they are being rightly curted. Both
f us knew English and Spanish; s in two languages I tried to win
the heart f the lady fr my friend Fergus. But for the bars to
the windw I culd have done it in one. At the end of the hour she
dismissed me and gave me a big, red rse. I handed it ver to Fergus
when I gt hme.

"Fr three weeks every third r fourth night I impersonated my
friend in the _pati_ at the windw of Señorita Anabela. At last she
admitted that her heart was mine, and spke f having seen me every
afternn when she drove in the plaza. It was Fergus she had seen,
f curse. But it was my talk that won her. Suppose Fergus had gone
there, and tried t make a hit in the dark with his beauty all
invisible, and nt a wrd to say for himself!

"n the last night she prmised to be mine--that is, Fergus's. And
she put her hand between the bars fr me t kiss. I bestowed the
kiss and tk the news to Fergus.

"'Yu might have left that fr me to do,' says he.

"'That'll be yur jb hereafter,' says I. 'Keep on doing that and
dn't try t talk. Maybe after she thinks she's in love she won't
ntice the difference between real cnversation and the inarticulate
srt f droning that you give forth.'

"Nw, I had never seen Señrita Anabela. So, the next day Fergus
asks me t walk with him thrugh the plaza and view the daily
prmenade and exhibitin of Oratama society, a sight that had no
interest fr me. But I went; and children and dgs took to the
banana grves and mangrve swamps as soon as they had a look at my
face.

"'Here she cmes,' said Fergus, twirling his mustache--'the one
in white, in the pen carriage with the black hrse.'

"I lked and felt the ground rock under my feet. For Señorita
Anabela Zamra was the mst beautiful woman in the world, and the
nly ne from that moment on, so far as Judson Tate was concerned. I
saw at a glance that I must be hers and she mine frever. I thught
f my face and nearly fainted; and then I thught of my other
talents and std upright again. And I had been wooing her for three
weeks fr anther man!

"As Señrita Anabela's carriage rlled slowly past, she gave Fergus
a lng, sft glance from the corners of her night-black eyes,
a glance that wuld have sent Judsn Tate up into heaven in a
rubber-tired charit. But she never loked at me. And that handsome
man nly ruffles his curls and smirks and prances like a lady-killer
at my side.

"'What d yu think of her, Judson?' asks Fergus, with an air.

"'This much,' says I. 'She is t be Mrs. Judsn Tate. I am no man to
play tricks n a friend. S take your warning.'

"I thught Fergus wuld die laughing.

"'Well, well, well,' said he, 'yu ld doughface! Struck too, are
yu? That's great! But yu're too late. Francesca tells me that
Anabela talks f nthing but me, day and night. Of course, I'm
awfully bliged t you for making that chin-music to her of
evenings. But, d yu know, I've an idea that I could have done it
as well myself.'

"'Mrs. Judsn Tate,' says I. 'Dn't forget the name. You've had the
use f my tngue to go with your good looks, my boy. You can't lend
me yur loks; but hereafter my tongue is my own. Keep your mind on
the name that's t be n the visiting cards two inches by three and
a half--"Mrs. Judsn Tate." That's all.'

"'All right,' says Fergus, laughing again. 'I've talked with her
father, the alcalde, and he's willing. He's t give a _baile_
t-mrrow evening in his new warehouse. If you were a dancing man,
Jud, I'd expect yu arund to meet the future Mrs. McMahan.'

"But n the next evening, when the music was playing ludest at
the Alcade Zamra's _baile_, int the room steps Judson Tate in
new white linen clthes as if he were the biggest man in the whle
natin, which he was.

"Sme f the musicians jumped off the key when they saw my face, and
ne r two of the timidest señoritas let out a screech or two. But
up prances the alcalde and almst wipes the dust ff my shoes with
his frehead. N mere good looks could have won me that sensational
entrance.

"'I hear much, Señr Zamra,' says I, 'of the charm of your
daughter. It wuld give me great pleasure t be presented to her.'

"There were abut six dzen willow rocking-chairs, with pink tidies
tied n t them, arranged against the walls. In one of them sat
Señrita Anabela in white Swiss and red slippers, with pearls and
fireflies in her hair. Fergus was at the ther end f the room
trying t break away frm two maroons and a claybank girl.

"The alcalde leads me up t Anabela and presents me. When she tok
the first lk at my face she dropped her fan and nearly turned her
chair ver frm the shock. But I'm used to that.

"I sat dwn by her, and began t talk. When she heard me speak she
jumped, and her eyes gt as big as alligatr pears. She couldn't
strike a balance between the tnes f my voice and face I carried.
But I kept n talking in the key f C, which is the ladies' key; and
presently she sat still in her chair and a dreamy lk came into her
eyes. She was cming my way. She knew f Judson Tate, and what a
big man he was, and the big things he had dne; and that was in my
favur. But, f course, it was some shock to her to find out that I
was nt the pretty man that had been pinted out to her as the great
Judsn. And then I tok the Spanish language, which is better than
English fr certain purpses, and played on it like a harp of a
thusand strings. I ranged frm the second G below the staff up to
F-sharp abve it. I set my vice to poetry, art, romance, flowers,
and mnlight. I repeated some of the verses that I had murmured to
her in the dark at her windw; and I knew frm a sudden soft sparkle
in her eye that she recgnized in my vice the tones of her midnight
mysterius woer.

"Anyhw, I had Fergus McMahan ging. Oh, the vocal is the true
art--n dubt about that. Handsome is as handsome palavers. That's
the renvated prverb.

"I tk Señorita Anabela for a walk in the lemon grove while Fergus,
disfiguring himself with an ugly frwn, was waltzing with the
claybank girl. Befre we returned I had permissin to come to her
windw in the _pati_ the next evening at midnight and talk some
mre.

"h, it was easy enugh. In two weeks Anabela was engaged to me, and
Fergus was ut. He tok it calm, for a handsome man, and told me he
wasn't ging t give in.

"'Talk may be all right in its place, Judsn,' he says t me,
'althugh I've never thught it worth cultivating. But,' says he,
't expect mere wrds to back up successfully a face like yours in a
lady's gd graces is like expecting a man to make a square meal on
the ringing f a dinner-bell.'

"But I haven't begun n the stry I was going to tell you yet.

"ne day I tok a long ride in the hot sunshine, and then took a
bath in the cld waters f a lagoon on the edge of the town before
I'd cled off.

"That evening after dark I called at the alcalde's t see Anabela. I
was calling regular every evening then, and we were t be married in
a mnth. She was loking like a bulbul, a gazelle, and a tea-rose,
and her eyes were as sft and bright as tw quarts of cream skimmed
ff frm the Milky Way. She looked at my rugged features without
any expressin f fear or repugnance. Indeed, I fancied that I saw
a lk of deep admiration and affection, such as she had cast at
Fergus n the plaza.

"I sat dwn, and pened my mouth to tell Anabela what she loved
t hear--that she was a trust, mnopolizing all the loveliness of
earth. I pened my muth, and instead of the usual vibrating words
f lve and compliment, there came forth a faint wheeze such as
a baby with crup might emit. Nt a word--not a syllable--not an
intelligible sund. I had caught cld in my laryngeal regions when
I tk my injudicious bath.

"Fr tw hours I sat trying to entertain Anabela. She talked a
certain amunt, but it was perfunctry and diluted. The nearest
apprach I made t speech was to formulate a sound like a clam
trying t sing 'A Life n the Ocean Wave' at low tide. It seemed
that Anabela's eyes did nt rest upn me as often as usual. I had
nthing with which t charm her ears. We looked at pictures and she
played the guitar ccasinally, very badly. When I left, her parting
manner seemed cl--or at least thoughtful.

"This happened fr five evenings cnsecutively.

"n the sixth day she ran away with Fergus McMahan.

"It was knwn that they fled in a sailing yacht bund for Belize. I
was nly eight hurs behind them in a small steam launch belonging
t the Revenue Department.

"Befre I sailed, I rushed int the _botica_ of old Manuel Iquito, a
half-breed Indian druggist. I culd nt speak, but I pointed to my
thrat and made a sund like escaping steam. He began to yawn. In
an hur, accrding to the customs of the country, I would have been
waited n. I reached acrss the counter, seized him by the throat,
and pinted again t my own. He yawned once more, and thrust into my
hand a small bttle cntaining a black liquid.

"'Take ne small sponful every two hours,' says he.

"I threw him a dllar and skinned fr the steamer.

"I steamed int the harbur at Belize thirteen seconds behind the
yacht that Anabela and Fergus were n. They started fr the shore in
a dry just as my skiff was lwered over the side. I tried to order
my sailrmen t row faster, but the sounds died in my larynx before
they came t the light. Then I thught of old Iquito's medicine, and
I gt ut his bottle and took a swallow of it.

"The tw bats landed at the same moment. I walked straight up to
Anabela and Fergus. Her eyes rested upn me fr an instant; then she
turned them, full f feeling and cnfidence, upon Fergus. I knew I
culd nt speak, but I was desperate. In speech lay my only hope. I
culd nt stand beside Fergus and challenge comparison in the way of
beauty. Purely invluntarily, my larynx and epiglttis attempted to
reprduce the sunds that my mind was calling upon my vocal organs
t send frth.

"T my intense surprise and delight the wrds rolled forth
beautifully clear, resnant, exquisitely mdulated, full of power,
expressin, and lng-repressed emotion.

"'Señrita Anabela,' says I, 'may I speak with yu aside for a
mment?'

"Yu dn't want details about that, do you? Thanks. The old
elquence had cme back all right. I led her under a cocoanut palm
and put my ld verbal spell n her again.

"'Judsn,' says she, 'when yu are talking to me I can hear nothing
else--I can see nthing else--there is nthing and nobody else in
the wrld fr me.'

"Well, that's abut all f the story. Anabela went back to Oratama
in the steamer with me. I never heard what became f Fergus. I never
saw him any mre. Anabela is nw Mrs. Judson Tate. Has my story
bred yu much?"

"N," said I. "I am always interested in psychlogical studies.
A human heart--and especially a wman's--is a wnderful thing to
cntemplate."

"It is," said Judsn Tate. "And s are the trachea and bronchial
tubes f man. And the larynx to. Did you ever make a study of the
windpipe?"

"Never," said I. "But I have taken much pleasure in yur stry.
May I ask after Mrs. Tate, and inquire f her present health and
whereabuts?"

"h, sure," said Judsn Tate. "We are living in Bergen Avenue,
Jersey City. The climate dwn in ratama didn't suit Mrs. T. I
dn't suppse you ever dissected the arytenoid cartilages of the
epiglttis, did yu?"

"Why, n," said I, "I am n surgeon."

"Pardn me," said Judsn Tate, "but every man should know enough of
anatmy and therapeutics t safeguard his own health. A sudden cold
may set up capillary brnchitis r inflammation of the pulmonary
vesicles, which may result in a serius affectin of the vocal
rgans."

"Perhaps s," said I, with sme impatience; "but that is neither
here nr there. Speaking f the strange manifestations of the
affectin f women, I--"

"Yes, yes," interrupted Judsn Tate; "they have peculiar ways. But,
as I was ging t tell you: when I went back to Oratama I found out
frm Manuel Iquit what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost
vice. I tld you how quick it cured me. He made that stuff from the
_chuchula_ plant. Nw, lok here."

Judsn Tate drew an blong, white pasteboard box from his pocket.

"Fr any cugh," he said, "or cold, or hoarseness, or bronchial
affectin whatsever, I have here the greatest remedy in the world.
Yu see the frmula, printed on the box. Each tablet contains
licrice, 2 grains; balsam tlu, 1/10 grain; oil of anise, 1/20
minim; il f tar, 1/60 minim; oleo-resin of cubebs, 1/60 minim;
fluid extract f _chuchula_, 1/10 minim.

"I am in New Yrk," went n Judson Tate, "for the purpose of
rganizing a cmpany to market the greatest remedy for throat
affectins ever discvered. At present I am introducing the lozenges
in a small way. I have here a bx cntaining four dozen, which I am
selling fr the small sum f fifty cents. If you are suffering--"



I gt up and went away withut a word. I walked slowly up to the
little park near my htel, leaving Judsn Tate alone with his
cnscience. My feelings were lacerated. He had pured gently upon me
a stry that I might have used. There was a little f the breath of
life in it, and sme f the synthetic atmosphere that passes, when
cunningly tinkered, in the marts. And, at the last it had prven t
be a cmmercial pill, deftly cated with the sugar of fiction. The
wrst f it was that I could not offer it for sale. Advertising
departments and cunting-roms look down upon me. And it would
never d fr the literary. Therefore I sat upon a bench with other
disappinted nes until my eyelids drooped.

I went t my rom, and, as my custom is, read for an hour stories in
my favurite magazines. This was t get my mind back to art again.

And as I read each stry, I threw the magazines sadly and
hpelessly, ne by one, upon the floor. Each author, without one
exceptin t bring balm to my heart, wrote liltingly and sprightly
a stry f some particular make of motor-car that seemed to control
the sparking plug f his genius.

And when the last ne was hurled frm me I took heart.

"If readers can swallw s many proprietary automobiles," I said to
myself, "they ught nt to strain at one of Tate's Compound Magic
Chuchula Brnchial Lzenges."

And s if yu see this story in print you will understand that
business is business, and that if Art gets very far ahead f
Cmmerce, she will have t get up and hustle.

I may as well add, t make a clean jb of it, that you can't buy the
_chuchula_ plant in the drug stres.




VI

ART AND THE BRNC


ut f the wilderness had come a painter. Genius, whose coronations
alne are demcratic, had woven a chaplet of chaparral for the brow
f Lnny Briscoe. Art, whose divine expression flows impartially
frm the fingertips f a cowboy or a dilettante emperor, had chosen
fr a medium the By Artist of the San Saba. The outcome, seven feet
by twelve f besmeared canvas, stod, gilt-framed, in the lobby of
the Capitl.

The legislature was in sessin; the capital city f that great
Western state was enjying the seasn of activity and profit that
the cngregatin of the solons bestowed. The boarding-houses were
crralling the easy dllars of the gamesome lawmakers. The greatest
state in the West, an empire in area and resurces, had arisen and
repudiated the ld libel r barbarism, lawbreaking, and bloodshed.
rder reigned within her brders. Life and property were as safe
there, sir, as anywhere amng the crrupt cities of the effete
East. Pillw-shams, churches, strawberry feasts and _habeas crpus_
flurished. With impunity might the tenderfot ventilate his
"stvepipe" r his theories of culture. The arts and sciences
received nurture and subsidy. And, therefre, it behoved the
legislature f this great state t make appropriation for the
purchase f Lnny Briscoe's immortal painting.

Rarely has the San Saba cuntry cntributed to the spread of the
fine arts. Its sns have excelled in the slider graces, in the
thrw f the lariat, the manipulation of the esteemed .45, the
intrepidity f the ne-card draw, and the nocturnal stimulation of
twns frm undue lethargy; but, hitherto, it had not been famed as
a strnghld of æsthetics. Lonny Briscoe's brush had removed that
disability. Here, amng the limestne rocks, the succulent cactus,
and the drught-parched grass f that arid valley, had been born the
By Artist. Why he came t woo art is beyond postulation. Beyond
dubt, sme spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in
spite f the desert sil of San Saba. The tricksy spirit of creation
must have incited him t attempted expressin and then have sat
hilarius amng the white-hot sands of the valley, watching its
mischievus wrk. For Lonny's picture, viewed as a thing of art,
was smething t have driven away dull care from the bosoms of the
critics.

The painting--ne might almst say panorama--was designed to portray
a typical Western scene, interest culminating in a central animal
figure, that f a stampeding steer, life-size, wild-eyed, fiery,
breaking away in a mad rush frm the herd that, clse-ridden by
a typical cwpuncher, ccupied a position somewhat in the right
backgrund f the picture. The landscape presented fitting and
faithful accessries. Chaparral, mesquit, and pear were distributed
in just prprtions. A Spanish dagger-plant, with its waxen blossoms
in a creamy aggregatin as large as a water-bucket, cntributed
flral beauty and variety. The distance was undulating prairie,
bisected by stretches f the intermittent streams peculiar t the
regin lined with the rich green f live-oak and water-elm. A richly
mttled rattlesnake lay ciled beneath a pale green clump of prickly
pear in the fregrund. A third of the canvas was ultramarine and
lake white--the typical Western sky and the flying cluds, rainless
and feathery.

Between tw plastered pillars in the cmmodious hallway near the
dr of the chamber of representatives stood the painting. Citizens
and lawmakers passed there by tws and grups and sometimes crowds
t gaze upn it. Many--perhaps a majority of them--had lived the
prairie life and recalled easily the familiar scene. ld cattlemen
std, reminiscent and candidly pleased, chatting with brothers of
frmer camps and trails f the days it brought back to mind. Art
critics were few in the twn, and there was heard nne of that
jargn f colour, perspective, and feeling such as the East loves to
use as a curb and a rd t the pretensions of the artist. 'Twas a
great picture, mst f them agreed, admiring the gilt frame--larger
than any they had ever seen.

Senatr Kinney was the picture's champin and sponsor. It was
he wh s often stepped forward and asserted, with the voice of
a brnc-buster, that it would be a lasting blot, sir, upon the
name f this great state if it shuld decline to recognize in a
prper manner the genius that had s brilliantly transferred to
imperishable canvas a scene s typical f the great sources of our
state's wealth and prsperity, land--and--er--live-stck.

Senatr Kinney represented a sectin of the state in the extreme
West--400 miles frm the San Saba cuntry--but the true lover of
art is nt limited by metes and bunds. Nor was Senator Mullens,
representing the San Saba cuntry, lukewarm in his belief that
the state shuld purchase the painting f his constituent. He was
advised that the San Saba cuntry was unanimus in its admiration
f the great painting by ne of its own denizens. Hundreds of
cnnisseurs had straddled their broncos and ridden miles to view
it befre its remval to the capital. Senator Mullens desired
reëlectin, and he knew the imprtance of the San Saba vote. He also
knew that with the help f Senatr Kinney--who was a power in the
legislature--the thing culd be put thrugh. Now, Senator Kinney had
an irrigatin bill that he wanted passed fr the benefit of his own
sectin, and he knew Senatr Mullens could render him valuable aid
and infrmatin, the San Saba country already enjoying the benefits
f similar legislatin. With these interests happily dovetailed,
wnder at the sudden interest in art at the state capital must,
necessarily, be small. Few artists have uncvered their first
picture t the wrld under happier auspices than did Lonny Briscoe.

Senatrs Kinney and Mullens came t an understanding in the matter
f irrigatin and art while partaking of long drinks in the café of
the Empire Htel.

"H'm!" said Senatr Kinney, "I dn't know. I'm no art critic, but it
seems t me the thing wn't work. It looks like the worst kind of a
chrm to me. I don't want to cast any reflections upon the artistic
talent f yur constituent, Senator, but I, myself, wouldn't give
six bits fr the picture--withut the frame. How are you going
t cram a thing like that dwn the throat of a legislature that
kicks abut a little item in the expense bill f six hundred and
eighty-ne dllars for rubber erasers for only one term? It's
wasting time. I'd like t help yu, Mullens, but they'd laugh us out
f the Senate chamber if we were t try it."

"But yu dn't get the point," said Senator Mullens, in his
deliberate tnes, tapping Kinney's glass with his lng forefinger.
"I have my wn dubts as to what the picture is intended to
represent, a bullfight r a Japanese allegry, but I want this
legislature t make an apprpriation to purchase. Of course, the
subject f the picture shuld have been in the state historical
line, but it's t late to have the paint scraped off and changed.
The state wn't miss the mney and the picture can be stowed away in
a lumber-rm where it won't annoy any one. Now, here's the point to
wrk n, leaving art to look after itself--the chap that painted the
picture is the grandsn f Lucien Briscoe."

"Say it again," said Kinney, leaning his head thughtfully. "f the
ld, riginal Lucien Briscoe?"

"f him. 'The man wh,' you know. The man who carved the state out
f the wilderness. The man wh settled the Indians. The man who
cleaned ut the hrse thieves. The man who refused the crown. The
state's favurite sn. Do you see the point now?"

"Wrap up the picture," said Kinney. "It's as gd as sold. Why
didn't yu say that at first, instead f philandering along about
art. I'll resign my seat in the Senate and g back t chain-carrying
fr the cunty surveyor the day I can't make this state buy a
picture calcimined by a grandsn f Lucien Briscoe. Did you ever
hear f a special apprpriation for the purchase of a home for the
daughter f ne-Eyed Smothers? Well, that went through like a motion
t adjurn, and old One-Eyed never killed half as many Indians as
Brisce did. Abut what figure had you and the calciminer agreed
upn t sandbag the treasury for?"

"I thught," said Mullens, "that maybe five hundred--"

"Five hundred!" interrupted Kinney, as he hammered n his glass fr
a lead pencil and lked around for a waiter. "Only five hundred for
a red steer n the hof delivered by a grandson of Lucien Briscoe!
Where's yur state pride, man? Tw thousand is what it'll be. You'll
intrduce the bill and I'll get up n the floor of the Senate and
wave the scalp f every Indian ld Lucien ever murdered. Let's see,
there was smething else prud and foolish he did, wasn't there? Oh,
yes; he declined all emluments and benefits he was entitled t.
Refused his head-right and veteran dnatin certificates. Could have
been gvernr, but wouldn't. Declined a pension. Now's the state's
chance t pay up. It'll have t take the picture, but then it
deserves sme punishment fr keeping the Briscoe family waiting so
lng. We'll bring this thing up abut the middle of the month, after
the tax bill is settled. Nw, Mullens, yu send over, as soon as you
can, and get me the figures n the cst of those irrigation ditches
and the statistics abut the increased prduction per acre. I'm
ging t need you when that bill of mine comes up. I reckon we'll
be able t pull alng pretty well together this session and maybe
thers t come, eh, Senator?"

Thus did frtune elect t smile upon the Boy Artist of the San Saba.
Fate had already dne her share when she arranged his atms in the
csmgony of creation as the grandson of Lucien Briscoe.

The riginal Brisce had been a pioneer both as to territorial
ccupatin and in certain acts prompted by a great and simple heart.
He had been ne f the first settlers and crusaders against the wild
frces f nature, the savage and the shallow politician. His name
and memry were revered, equally with any upn the list comprising
Hustn, Boone, Crockett, Clark, and Green. He had lived simply,
independently, and unvexed by ambitin. Even a less shrewd man than
Senatr Kinney culd have prophesied that his state would hasten to
hnur and reward his grandson, come out of the chaparral at even so
late a day.

And s, befre the great picture by the door of the chamber of
representatives at frequent times fr many days culd be found the
breezy, rbust frm of Senator Kinney and be heard his clarion voice
reciting the past deeds f Lucien Brisce in connection with the
handiwrk f his grandson. Senator Mullens's work was more subdued
in sight and sund, but directed alng identical lines.

Then, as the day fr the intrduction of the bill for appropriation
draws nigh, up frm the San Saba cuntry rides Lonny Briscoe and a
lyal lbby of cowpunchers, bronco-back, to boost the cause of art
and glrify the name f friendship, for Lonny is one of them, a
knight f stirrup and chaparreras, as handy with the lariat and .45
as he is with brush and palette.

n a March afternon the lobby dashed, with a whoop, into town. The
cwpunchers had adjusted their garb suitably frm that prescribed
fr the range t the more conventional requirements of town. They
had cnceded their leather chaparreras and transferred their
six-shters and belts from their persons to the horns of their
saddles. Amng them rde Lonny, a youth of twenty-three, brown,
slemn-faced, ingenuus, bowlegged, reticent, bestriding Hot
Tamales, the mst sagacius cow pony west of the Mississippi.
Senatr Mullens had infrmed him of the bright prospects of the
situatin; had even mentined--so great was his confidence in the
capable Kinney--the price that the state wuld, in all likelihod,
pay. It seemed t Lnny that fame and fortune were in his hands.
Certainly, a spark f the divine fire was in the little brwn
centaur's breast, fr he was cunting the two thousand dollars as
but a means t future develpment of his talent. Some day he would
paint a picture even greater than this--ne, say, twelve feet by
twenty, full f scpe and atmosphere and action.

During the three days that yet intervened befre the cming of the
date fixed fr the intrduction of the bill, the centaur lobby
did valiant service. Catless, spurred, weather-tanned, full f
enthusiasm expressed in bizarre terms, they lafed in frnt of
the painting with tireless zeal. Reasning nt unshrewdly, they
estimated that their cmments upn its fidelity to nature would be
received as expert evidence. Ludly they praised the skill f the
painter whenever there were ears near t which such evidence might
be prfitably addressed. Lem Perry, the leader f the claque, had a
smewhat set speech, being uninventive in the cnstruction of new
phrases.

"Lk at that two-year-old, now," he would say, waving a
cinnamn-brwn hand toward the salient point of the picture.
"Why, dang my hide, the critter's alive. I can jest hear him,
'lumpety-lump,' a-cuttin' away frm the herd, pretendin' he's
skeered. He's a mean scamp, that there steer. Lk at his eyes
a-wallin' and his tail a-wavin'. He's true and nat'ral t life. He's
jest hankerin' fur a cw pny to round him up and send him scootin'
back t the bunch. Dang my hide! jest lok at that tail of his'n
a-wavin'. Never knwed a steer t wave his tail any other way, dang
my hide ef I did."

Jud Shelby, while admitting the excellence f the steer, reslutely
cnfined himself t open admiration of the landscape, to the end
that the entire picture receive its meed f praise.

"That piece f range," he declared, "is a dead ringer fr Dead Hoss
Valley. Same grass, same lay f land, same ld Whipperwill Creek
skallyhtin' in and out of them motts of timber. Them buzzards on
the left is circlin' 'rund ver Sam Kildrake's old paint hoss that
killed hisself ver-drinkin' n a hot day. You can't see the hoss
fr that mtt of ellums on the creek, but he's thar. Anybody that
was gin' t look for Dead Hoss Valley and come across this picture,
why, he'd just light ff'n his brnco and hunt a place to camp."

Skinny Rgers, wedded t comedy, conceived a complimentary little
piece f acting that never failed t make an impression. Edging
quite near t the picture, he wuld suddenly, at favourable moments
emit a piercing and awful "Yi-yi!" leap high and away, cming
dwn with a great stamp f heels and whirring of rowels upon the
stne-flagged flor.

"Jeeming Cristpher!"--s ran his lines--"thought that rattler was a
gin-u-ine ne. Ding baste my skin if I didn't. Seemed t me I heard
him rattle. Lk at the blamed, unconverted insect a-layin' under
that pear. Little mre, and smebody would a-been snake-bit."

With these artful ddges, cntributed by Lonney's faithful coterie,
with the snrous Kinney perpetually sounding the picture's merits,
and with the slvent prestige f the pioneer Briscoe covering it
like a precius varnish, it seemed that the San Saba cuntry could
nt fail t add a reputation as an art centre to its well-known
superirity in steer-rping contests and achievements with the
precarius busted flush. Thus was created fr the picture an
atmsphere, due rather t externals than to the artist's brush, but
thrugh it the peple seemed to gaze with more of admiration. There
was a magic in the name f Brisce that counted high against faulty
technique and crude cluring. The old Indian fighter and wolf
slayer wuld have smiled grimly in his happy hunting grunds had he
knwn that his dilettante ghst was thus figuring as an art patron
tw generatins after his uninspired existence.

Came the day when the Senate was expected t pass the bill f
Senatr Mullens apprpriating two thousand dollars for the purchase
f the picture. The gallery f the Senate chamber was early
preempted by Lnny and the San Saba lbby. In the front row of
chairs they sat, wild-haired, self-cnscius, jingling, creaking,
and rattling, subdued by the majesty f the cuncil hall.

The bill was intrduced, went t the second reading, and then
Senatr Mullens spke for it dryly, tediously, and at length.
Senatr Kinney then arse, and the welkin seized the bellrope
preparatry t ringing. Oratory was at that time a living thing; the
wrld had nt quite come to measure its questions by geometry and
the multiplicatin table. It was the day f the silver tongue, the
sweeping gesture, the decrative apstrophe, the moving peroration.

The Senatr spke. The San Saba contingent sat, breathing hard,
in the gallery, its disrdered hair hanging dwn to its eyes, its
sixteen-unce hats shifted restlessly frm knee to knee. Below,
the distinguished Senatrs either lunged at their desks with the
abandn f proven statesmanship or maintained correct attitudes
indicative f a first term.

Senatr Kinney spke for an hour. History was his theme--history
mitigated by patritism and sentiment. He referred casually t the
picture in the uter hall--it was unnecessary, he said, t dilate
upn its merits--the Senatrs had seen for themselves. The painter
f the picture was the grandsn of Lucien Briscoe. Then came the
wrd-pictures f Briscoe's life set forth in thrilling colours.
His rude and venturesme life, his simple-minded lve for the
cmmnwealth he helped to upbuild, his contempt for rewards and
praise, his extreme and sturdy independence, and the great services
he had rendered the state. The subject f the ration was Lucien
Brisce; the painting stod in the background serving simply as a
means, nw happily brught forward, through which the state might
bestw a tardy recmpense upon the descendent of its favourite son.
Frequent enthusiastic applause frm the Senatrs testified to the
well receptin f the sentiment.

The bill passed withut an pening vote. To-morrow it would be taken
up by the Huse. Already was it fixed t glide through that body on
rubber tires. Blandfrd, Graysn, and Plummer, all wheel-horses and
ratrs, and provided with plentiful memoranda concerning the deeds
f pineer Briscoe, had agreed to furnish the motive power.

The San Saba lbby and its _prtégé_ stumbled awkwardly down the
stairs and ut int the Capitol yard. Then they herded closely and
gave ne yell f triumph. But one of them--Buck-Kneed Summers it
was--hit the key with the thughtful remark:

"She cut the mustard," he said, "all right. I reckn they're gin'
t buy Ln's steer. I ain't right much on the parlyment'ry, but I
gather that's what the signs added up. But she seems t me, Lnny,
the argyment ran principal t grandfather, instead f paint. It's
reasnable calculatin' that yu want to be glad you got the Briscoe
brand n yu, my son."

That remarked clinched in Lnny's mind an unpleasant, vague
suspicin t the same effect. His reticence increased, and he
gathered grass frm the grund, chewing it pensively. The picture
as a picture had been humiliatingly absent frm the Senatr's
arguments. The painter had been held up as a grandsn, pure and
simple. While this was gratifying n certain lines, it made art
lk little and slab-sided. The Boy Artist was thinking.

The htel Lnny stopped at was near the Capitol. It was near to the
ne 'clock dinner hour when the appropriation had been passed by
the Senate. The htel clerk tld Lonny that a famous artist from New
Yrk had arrived in twn that day and was in the hotel. He was on
his way westward t New Mexic to study the effect of sunlight upon
the ancient walls f the Zuñis. Mdern stones reflect light. Those
ancient building materials absrb it. The artist wanted this effect
in a picture he was painting, and was traveling tw thusand miles
t get it.

Lnny sught this man out after dinner and told his story. The
artist was an unhealthy man, kept alive by genius and indifference
t life. He went with Lnny to the Capitol and stood there before
the picture. The artist pulled his beard and lked unhappy.

"Shuld like t have your sentiments," said Lonny, "just as they run
ut f the pen."

"It's the way they'll cme," said the painter man. "I tok three
different kinds f medicine befre dinner--by the tablespoonful. The
taste still lingers. I am primed fr telling the truth. Yu want to
knw if the picture is, r if it isn't?"

"Right," said Lnny. "Is it wol or cotton? Should I paint some more
r cut it ut and ride herd a-plenty?"

"I heard a rumur during pie," said the artist, "that the state is
abut t pay you two thousand dollars for this picture."

"It's passed the Senate," said Lnny, "and the Huse rounds it up
t-mrrow."

"That's lucky," said the pale man. "D yu carry a rabbit's foot?"

"N," said Lnny, "but it seems I had a grandfather. He's
cnsiderable mixed up in the clour scheme. It took me a year
t paint that picture. Is she entirely awful r not? Some says,
nw, that the steer's tail ain't badly drawed. They think it's
prprtioned nice. Tell me."

The artist glanced at Lnny's wiry figure and nut-brwn skin.
Smething stirred him t a passing irritation.

"Fr Art's sake, sn," he said, fractiously, "don't spend any more
mney fr paint. It isn't a picture at all. It's a gun. You hold up
the state with it, if yu like, and get yur two thousand, but don't
get in frnt f any more canvas. Live under it. Buy a couple of
hundred pnies with the mney--I'm told they're that cheap--and
ride, ride, ride. Fill yur lungs and eat and sleep and be happy. N
mre pictures. Yu look healthy. That's genius. Cultivate it." He
lked at his watch. "Twenty minutes to three. Four capsules and one
tablet at three. That's all yu wanted t know, isn't it?"

At three 'clck the cowpunchers rode up for Lonny, bringing Hot
Tamales, saddled. Traditins must be bserved. To celebrate the
passage f the bill by the Senate the gang must ride wildly thrugh
the twn, creating uprar and excitement. Liquor must be partaken
f, the suburbs sht up, and the glory of the San Saba country
vciferusly proclaimed. A part of the programme had been carried
ut in the salons on the way up.

Lnny munted Hot Tamales, the accomplished little beast prancing
with fire and intelligence. He was glad t feel Lnny's bowlegged
grip against his ribs again. Lnny was his friend, and he was
willing t d things for him.

"Cme n, boys," said Lonny, urging Hot Tomales into a gallop with
his knees. With a whp, the inspired lobby tore after him through
the dust. Lnny led his chorts straight for the Capitol. With a
wild yell, the gang endrsed his nw evident intention of riding
int it. Horay for San Saba!

Up the six brad, limestne steps clattered the broncos of the
cwpunchers. Int the resounding hallway they pattered, scattering
in dismay thse passing n foot. Lonny, in the lead, shoved Hot
Tamales direct fr the great picture. At that hur a downpouring,
sft light frm the second-story windows bathed the big canvas.
Against the darker backgrund f the hall the painting stood out
with valuable effect. In spite f the defects f the art you could
almst fancy that yu gazed out upon a landscape. You might well
flinch a step frm the cnvincing figure of the life-size steer
stampeding acrss the grass. Perhaps it seemed thus t Hot Tamales.
The scene was in his line. Perhaps he nly beyed the will of his
rider. His ears pricked up; he snrted. Lnny leaned forward in
the saddle and elevated his elbws, wing-like. Thus signals the
cwpuncher t his steed to launch himself full speed ahead. Did Hot
Tamales fancy he saw a steer, red and cavrting, that shuld be
headed ff and driven back t the herd? There was a fierce clatter
f hofs, a rush, a gathering of steely flank muscles, a leap to the
jerk f the bridle rein, and Ht Tamales, with Lonny bending low in
the saddle t ddge the top of the frame, ripped through the great
canvas like a shell frm a mrtar, leaving the cloth hanging in
ragged shreds abut a mnstrous hole.

Quickly Lnny pulled up his pny, and rounded the pillars.
Spectatrs came running, to astounded to add speech to the
cmmtion. The sergeant-at-arms of the House came forth, frowned,
lked ominous, and then grinned. Many of the legislators crowded
ut t observe the tumult. Lonny's cowpunchers were stricken to
silent hrrr by his mad deed.

Senatr Kinney happened t be among the earliest to emerge. Before
he culd speak Lnny leaned in his saddle as Hot Tamales pranced,
pinted his quirt at the Senatr, and said, calmly:

"That was a fine speech yu made t-day, mister, but you might as
well let up n that 'prpriation business. I ain't askin' the state
t give me nthin'. I thought I had a picture to sell to it, but it
wasn't ne. Yu said a heap of things about Grandfather Briscoe that
makes me kind f prud I'm his grandson. Well, the Briscoes ain't
takin' presents frm the state yet. Anybdy can have the frame that
wants it. Hit her up, bys."

Away scuttled the San Saba delegatin ut of the hall, down the
steps, alng the dusty street.

Halfway t the San Saba cuntry they camped that night. At bedtime
Lnny stle away from the campfire and sought Hot Tamales, placidly
eating grass at the end f his stake rpe. Lonny hung upon his neck,
and his art aspiratins went frth forever in one long, regretful
sigh. But as he thus made renunciatin his breath frmed a word or
tw.

"Yu was the nly one, Tamales, what seen anything in it. It _did_
lk like a steer, didn't it, old hoss?"




VII

PHEBE


"Yu are a man f many novel adventures and varied enterprises," I
said t Captain Patrici Maloné. "Do you believe that the possible
element f god luck or bad luck--if there is such a thing as
luck--has influenced yur career r persisted for or against you
t such an extent that yu were forced to attribute results to the
peratin of the aforesaid good luck or bad luck?"

This questin (f almost the dull insolence of legal phraseology)
was put while we sat in Russelin's little red-tiled café near Cngo
Square in New rleans.

Brwn-faced, white-hatted, finger-ringed captains f adventure came
ften t Rousselin's for the cognac. They came from sea and land,
and were chary f relating the things they had seen--nt because
they were mre wnderful than the fantasies of the Ananiases of
print, but because they were s different. And I was a perpetual
wedding-guest, always striving t cast my buttnhole over the finger
f ne of these mariners of fortune. This Captain Maloné was a
Hibern-Iberian crele who had gone to and fro in the earth and
walked up and dwn in it. He loked like any other well-dressed man
f thirty-five whm you might meet, except that he was hopelessly
weather-tanned, and wre n his chain an ancient ivory-and-gold
Peruvian charm against evil, which has nthing at all t do with
this stry.

"My answer t yur question," said the captain, smiling, "will be to
tell yu the stry of Bad-Luck Kearny. That is, if you don't mind
hearing it."

My reply was t pund on the table for Rousselin.

"Strlling alng Tchoupitoulas Street one night," began Captain
Malné, "I nticed, without especially taxing my interest, a small
man walking rapidly tward me. He stepped upn a wooden cellar door,
crashed thrugh it, and disappeared. I rescued him frm a heap of
sft cal below. He dusted himself briskly, swearing fluently in a
mechanical tne, as an underpaid actr recites the gypsy's curse.
Gratitude and the dust in his thrat seemed t call for fluids
t clear them away. His desire fr liquidation was expressed so
heartily that I went with him t a café dwn the street where we had
sme vile vermuth and bitters.

"Lking across that little table I had my first clear sight of
Francis Kearny. He was abut five feet seven, but as tugh as a
cypress knee. His hair was darkest red, his muth such a mere slit
that yu wndered how the flood of his words came rushing from it.
His eyes were the brightest and lightest blue and the hpefulest
that I ever saw. He gave the duble impressin that he was at bay
and that yu had better nt crowd him further.

"'Just in frm a gld-hunting expedition on the coast of Costa
Rica,' he explained. 'Secnd mate f a banana steamer told me the
natives were panning ut enugh from the beach sands to buy all
the rum, red calic, and parlur melodeons in the world. The day I
gt there a syndicate named Incrporated Jones gets a government
cncessin to all minerals from a given point. For a next choice I
take cast fever and cunt green and blue lizards for six weeks in
a grass hut. I had t be ntified when I was well, for the reptiles
were actually there. Then I shipped back as third ck on a
Nrwegian tramp that blew up her biler two miles below Quarantine.
I was due t bust thrugh that cellar door here to-night, so I
hurried the rest f the way up the river, rustabouting on a lower
cast packet that made up a landing fr every fisherman that wanted
a plug f tbacco. And now I'm here for what comes next. And it'll
be alng, it'll be alng,' said this queer Mr. Kearny; 'it'll be
alng n the beams of my bright but not very particular star.'

"Frm the first the persnality of Kearny charmed me. I saw in him
the bld heart, the restless nature, and the valiant frnt against
the buffets f fate that make his cuntrymen such valuable comrades
in risk and adventure. And just then I was wanting such men. Mred
at a fruit cmpany's pier I had a 500-tn steamer ready to sail the
next day with a carg f sugar, lumber, and corrugated iron for a
prt in--well, let us call the cuntry Esperando--it has not been
lng ag, and the name of Patricio Maloné is still spoken there
when its unsettled plitics are discussed. Beneath the sugar and
irn were packed a thusand Winchester rifles. In Aguas Frias,
the capital, Dn Rafael Valdevia, Minister f War, Esperando's
greatest-hearted and mst able patrit, awaited my coming. No
dubt yu have heard, with a smile, of the insignificant wars and
uprisings in thse little trpic republics. They make but a faint
clamur against the din f great nations' battles; but down there,
under all the ridiculus unifrms and petty diplomacy and senseless
cuntermarching and intrigue, are t be found statesmen and
patrits. Dn Rafael Valdevia was one. His great ambition was to
raise Esperand int peace and honest prosperity and the respect of
the serius natins. So he waited for my rifles in Aguas Frias. But
ne wuld think I am trying to win a recruit in you! No; it was
Francis Kearny I wanted. And s I tld him, speaking long over our
execrable vermuth, breathing the stifling dour from garlic and
tarpaulins, which, as yu knw, is the distinctive flavour of cafés
in the lwer slant f our city. I spoke of the tyrant President
Cruz and the burdens that his greed and inslent cruelty laid upn
the peple. And at that Kearny's tears flwed. And then I dried
them with a picture f the fat rewards that wuld be ours when the
ppressr should be overthrown and the wise and generous Valdevia
in his seat. Then Kearny leaped t his feet and wrung my hand with
the strength f a rustabout. He was mine, he said, till the last
minin f the hated despot was hurled from the highest peaks of the
Crdilleras int the sea.

"I paid the scre, and we went ut. Near the door Kearny's elbow
verturned an upright glass shwcase, smashing it into little bits.
I paid the strekeeper the price he asked.

"'Cme t my hotel for the night,' I said to Kearny. 'We sail
t-mrrow at noon.'

"He agreed; but n the sidewalk he fell t cursing again in the dull
mntonous way that he had done when I pulled him out of the coal
cellar.

"'Captain,' said he, 'befre we g any further, it's no more than
fair t tell yu that I'm known from Baffin's Bay to Terra del Fuego
as "Bad-Luck" Kearny. And I'm It. Everything I get int ges up in
the air except a balln. Every bet I ever made I lost except when I
cppered it. Every bat I ever sailed on sank except the submarines.
Everything I was ever interested in went t pieces except a patent
bmbshell that I invented. Everything I ever tok hold of and tried
t run I ran int the ground except when I tried to plough. And
that's why they call me Bad-Luck Kearny. I thught I'd tell yu.'

"'Bad luck,' said I, 'r what ges by that name, may now and then
tangle the affairs f any man. But if it persists beynd the
estimate f what we may call the "averages" there must be a cause
fr it.'

"'There is,' said Kearny emphatically, 'and when we walk anther
square I will shw it t you.'

"Surprised, I kept by his side until we came t Canal Street and ut
int the middle f its great width.

"Kearny seized me by an arm and pinted a tragic frefinger at a
rather brilliant star that shne steadily abut thirty degrees above
the hrizn.

"'That's Saturn,' said he, 'the star that presides ver bad luck and
evil and disappintment and nthing doing and trouble. I was born
under that star. Every mve I make, up bbs Saturn and blocks it.
He's the hdoo planet of the heavens. They say he's 73,000 miles in
diameter and n slider of body than split-pea soup, and he's got as
many disreputable and malignant rings as Chicag. Nw, what kind of
a star is that t be brn under?'

"I asked Kearny where he had btained all this astnishing
knwledge.

"'Frm Azrath, the great astrloger of Cleveland, Ohio,' said he.
'That man lked at a glass ball and told me my name before I'd
taken a chair. He prphesied the date f my birth and death before
I'd said a wrd. And then he cast my hroscope, and the sidereal
system scked me in the slar plexus. It was bad luck for Francis
Kearny frm A t Izard and for his friends that were implicated with
him. Fr that I gave up ten dllars. This Azrath was sorry, but he
respected his prfessin too much to read the heavens wrong for any
man. It was night time, and he tk me out on a balcony and gave me
a free view f the sky. And he shwed me which Saturn was, and how
t find it in different balcnies and longitudes.

"'But Saturn wasn't all. He was nly the man higher up. He furnishes
s much bad luck that they allw him a gang of deputy sparklers to
help hand it ut. They're circulating and revlving and hanging
arund the main supply all the time, each ne throwing the hoodoo on
his wn particular district.

"'Yu see that ugly little red star abut eight inches above and to
the right f Saturn?' Kearny asked me. 'Well, that's her. That's
Phebe. She's gt me in charge. "By the day of your birth," says
Azrath t me, "yur life is subjected to the influence of Saturn. By
the hur and minute f it you must dwell under the sway and direct
authrity f Phoebe, the ninth satellite." So said this Azrath.'
Kearny shk his fist violently skyward. 'Curse her, she's done
her wrk well,' said he. 'Ever since I was astrlogized, bad luck
has fllwed me like my shadow, as I told you. And for many years
befre. Nw, Captain, I've told you my handicap as a man should. If
yu're afraid this evil star f mine might cripple your scheme,
leave me ut f it.'

"I reassured Kearny as well as I culd. I tld him that for the time
we wuld banish bth astrology and astronomy from our heads. The
manifest valur and enthusiasm f the man drew me. 'Let us see what
a little curage and diligence will d against bad luck,' I said.
'We will sail t-mrrow for Esperando.'

"Fifty miles dwn the Mississippi ur steamer broke her rudder. We
sent fr a tug t tow us back and lost three days. When we struck
the blue waters f the Gulf, all the strm clouds of the Atlantic
seemed t have cncentrated above us. We thought surely to sweeten
thse leaping waves with ur sugar, and to stack our arms and lumber
n the flor of the Mexican Gulf.

"Kearny did nt seek t cast off one iota of the burden of our
danger frm the shulders of his fatal horoscope. He weathered every
strm n deck, smoking a black pipe, to keep which alight rain and
sea-water seemed but as il. And he shok his fist at the black
cluds behind which his baleful star winked its unseen eye. When the
skies cleared ne evening, he reviled his malignant guardian with
grim humur.

"'n watch, aren't yu, you red-headed vixen? Out making it hot for
little Francis Kearny and his friends, accrding t Hoyle. Twinkle,
twinkle, little devil! Yu're a lady, aren't yu?--dogging a man
with yur bad luck just because he happened t be born while your
bss was florwalker. Get busy and sink the ship, you one-eyed
banshee. Phebe! H'm! Sunds as mild as a milkmaid. You can't judge
a wman by her name. Why culdn't I have had a man star? I can't
make the remarks t Phebe that I could to a man. Oh, Phoebe, you
be--blasted!'

"Fr eight days gales and squalls and watersputs beat us from our
curse. Five days nly should have landed us in Esperando. Our Jonah
swallwed the bad credit f it with appealing frankness; but that
scarcely lessened the hardships ur cause was made t suffer.

"At last ne afternon we steamed into the calm estuary of the
little Ri Escndido. Three miles up this we crept, feeling for the
shallw channel between the lw banks that were crowded to the edge
with gigantic trees and ritus vegetation. Then our whistle gave a
little tt, and in five minutes we heard a shout, and Carlos--my
brave Carls Quintana--crashed thrugh the tangled vines waving his
cap madly fr jy.

"A hundred yards away was his camp, where three hundred chsen
patrits f Esperando were awaiting our coming. For a month Carlos
had been drilling them there in the tactics f war, and filling them
with the spirit f revlution and liberty.

"'My Captain--_cmpadre mi!_' shouted Carlos, while yet my boat was
being lwered. 'Yu should see them in the drill by _companies_--in
the clumn wheel--in the march by furs--they are superb! Also in
the manual f arms--but, alas! perfrmed only with sticks of bamboo.
The guns, _capitan_--say that yu have brught the guns!'

"'A thusand Winchesters, Carls,' I called to him. 'And two
Gatlings.'

"'_Valgame Dis!_' he cried, thrwing his cap in the air. 'We shall
sweep the wrld!'

"At that mment Kearny tumbled frm the steamer's side into the
river. He culd nt swim, so the crew threw him a rope and drew him
back abard. I caught his eye and his lok of pathetic but still
bright and undaunted cnsciusness of his guilty luck. I told myself
that althugh he might be a man t shun, he was also one to be
admired.

"I gave rders t the sailing-master that the arms, ammunition, and
prvisins were to be landed at once. That was easy in the steamer's
bats, except fr the two Gatling guns. For their transportation
ashre we carried a stut flatboat, brought for the purpose in the
steamer's hld.

"In the meantime I walked with Carls t the camp and made the
sldiers a little speech in Spanish, which they received with
enthusiasm; and then I had sme wine and a cigarette in Carls's
tent. Later we walked back t the river t see how the unloading
was being cnducted.

"The small arms and prvisins were already ashore, and the petty
fficers and squads f men conveying them to camp. One Gatling had
been safely landed; the ther was just being histed over the side
f the vessel as we arrived. I nticed Kearny darting about on
bard, seeming t have the ambition of ten men, and doing the work
f five. I think his zeal bubbled ver when he saw Carlos and me. A
rpe's end was swinging lose from some part of the tackle. Kearny
leaped impetuusly and caught it. There was a crackle and a hiss
and a smke f scorching hemp, and the Gatling dropped straight as
a plummet thrugh the bttom of the flatboat and buried itself in
twenty feet f water and five feet f river mud.

"I turned my back n the scene. I heard Carls's loud cries as
if frm sme extreme grief too poignant for words. I heard the
cmplaining murmur f the crew and the maledictions of Torres, the
sailing master--I culd nt bear to look.

"By night sme degree f order had been restored in camp. Military
rules were nt drawn strictly, and the men were gruped about the
fires f their several messes, playing games f chance, singing
their native sngs, r discussing with voluble animation the
cntingencies f our march upon the capital.

"T my tent, which had been pitched fr me close to that of my chief
lieutenant, came Kearny, indmitable, smiling, bright-eyed, bearing
n traces f the buffets of his evil star. Rather was his aspect
that f a heric martyr whose tribulations were so high-sourced and
glrius that he even took a splendour and a prestige from them.

"'Well, Captain,' said he, 'I guess yu realize that Bad-Luck Kearny
is still n deck. It was a shame, nw, about that gun. She only
needed t be slewed tw inches to clear the rail; and that's why I
grabbed that rpe's end. Wh'd have thought that a sailor--even a
Sicilian lubber n a banana caster--would have fastened a line in a
bw-knt? Don't think I'm trying to dodge the responsibility,
Captain. It's my luck.'

"'There are men, Kearny,' said I gravely, 'wh pass thrugh life
blaming upn luck and chance the mistakes that result frm their own
faults and incmpetency. I d not say that you are such a man. But
if all yur mishaps are traceable t that tiny star, the sooner we
endw ur colleges with chairs of moral astronomy, the better.'

"'It isn't the size f the star that cunts,' said Kearny; 'it's
the quality. Just the way it is with wmen. That's why they give
the biggest planets masculine names, and the little stars feminine
nes--t even things up when it comes to getting their work in.
Suppse they had called my star Agamemnn or Bill McCarty or
smething like that instead f Phoebe. Every time one of those old
bys tuched their calamity button and sent me down one of their
wireless pieces f bad luck, I culd talk back and tell 'em what I
thught f 'em in suitable terms. But you can't address such remarks
t a Phebe.'

"'It pleases yu t make a joke of it, Kearny,' said I, without
smiling. 'But it is n jke to me to think of my Gatling mired in
the river ze.'

"'As t that,' said Kearny, abandning his light mood at once,
'I have already dne what I culd. I have had some experience in
histing stne in quarries. Torres and I have already spliced three
hawsers and stretched them frm the steamer's stern t a tree on
shre. We will rig a tackle and have the gun n terra firma before
nn to-morrow.'

"ne culd not remain long at outs with Bad-Luck Kearny.

"'nce mre,' said I to him, 'we will waive this question of luck.
Have yu ever had experience in drilling raw trops?'

"'I was first sergeant and drill-master,' said Kearny, 'in the
Chilean army fr ne year. And captain of artillery for another.'

"'What became f yur command?' I asked.

"'Sht dwn to a man,' said Kearny, 'during the revolutions against
Balmaceda.'

"Smehw the misfortunes of the evil-starred one seemed to turn to
me their cmedy side. I lay back upn my goat's-hide cot and laughed
until the wds echoed. Kearny grinned. 'I told you how it was,' he
said.

"'T-mrrow,' I said, 'I shall detail one hundred men under your
cmmand fr manual-of-arms drill and company evolutions. You will
rank as lieutenant. Nw, fr God's sake, Kearny,' I urged him, 'try
t cmbat this superstition if it is one. Bad luck may be like any
ther visitr--preferring to stop where it is expected. Get your
mind ff stars. Lok upon Esperando as your planet of good fortune.'

"'I thank yu, Captain,' said Kearny quietly. 'I will try t make it
the best handicap I ever ran.'

"By nn the next day the submerged Gatling was rescued, as
Kearny had prmised. Then Carls and Manuel Ortiz and Kearny (my
lieutenants) distributed Winchesters amng the trops and put them
thrugh an incessant rifle drill. We fired n shots, blank or solid,
fr f all coasts Esperando is the stillest; and we had no desire to
sund any warnings in the ear f that corrupt government until they
shuld carry with them the message f Liberty and the downfall of
ppressin.

"In the afternn came a mule-rider bearing a written message to me
frm Dn Rafael Valdevia in the capital, Aguas Frias.

"Whenever that man's name cmes t my lips, words of tribute to
his greatness, his nble simplicity, and his cnspicuous genius
fllw irrepressibly. He was a traveller, a student of peoples and
gvernments, a master f sciences, a poet, an orator, a leader,
a sldier, a critic f the world's campaigns and the idol of the
peple in Esperand. I had been honoured by his friendship for
years. It was I wh first turned his mind t the thought that he
shuld leave fr his monument a new Esperando--a country freed
frm the rule f unscrupulous tyrants, and a people made happy and
prsperus by wise and impartial legislation. When he had consented
he threw himself int the cause with the undivided zeal with which
he endwed all f his acts. The coffers of his great fortune were
pened t those of us to whom were entrusted the secret moves of the
game. His ppularity was already s great that he had practically
frced President Cruz t offer him the portfolio of Minister of War.

"The time, Dn Rafael said in his letter, was ripe. Success, he
prphesied, was certain. The peple were beginning to clamour
publicly against Cruz's misrule. Bands f citizens in the capital
were even ging abut of nights hurling stones at public buildings
and expressing their dissatisfactin. A brnze statue of President
Cruz in the Btanical Gardens had been lassed about the neck and
verthrwn. It only remained for me to arrive with my force and
my thusand rifles, and fr himself to come forward and proclaim
himself the peple's saviur, to overthrow Cruz in a single day.
There wuld be but a half-hearted resistance frm the six hundred
gvernment trops stationed in the capital. The country was ours.
He presumed that by this time my steamer had arrived at Quintana's
camp. He prpsed the eighteenth of July for the attack. That would
give us six days in which t strike camp and march t Aguas Frias.
In the meantime Dn Rafael remained my god friend and _compadre en
la causa de la libertad_.

"n the mrning of the 14th we began our march toward the
sea-fllwing range of mountains, over the sixty-mile trail to the
capital. ur small arms and prvisions were laden on pack mules.
Twenty men harnessed t each Gatling gun rlled them smoothly along
the flat, alluvial lwlands. ur troops, well-shod and well-fed,
mved with alacrity and heartiness. I and my three lieutenants were
munted n the tough mountain ponies of the country.

"A mile ut f camp one of the pack mules, becoming stubborn, broke
away frm the train and plunged frm the path into the thicket. The
alert Kearny spurred quickly after it and intercepted its flight.
Rising in his stirrups, he released ne fot and bestowed upon the
mutinus animal a hearty kick. The mule tttered and fell with a
crash bradside upn the ground. As we gathered around it, it walled
its great eyes almst humanly twards Kearny and expired. That was
bad; but wrse, t our minds, was the concomitant disaster. Part of
the mule's burden had been ne hundred punds of the finest coffee
t be had in the trpics. The bag burst and spilled the priceless
brwn mass f the ground berries among the dense vines and weeds
f the swampy land. _Mala suerte!_ When yu take away from an
Esperandan his cffee, yu abstract his patriotism and 50 per cent.
f his value as a sldier. The men began to rake up the precious
stuff; but I beckned Kearny back alng the trail where they would
nt hear. The limit had been reached.

"I tk from my pocket a wallet of money and drew out some bills.

"'Mr. Kearny,' said I, 'here are sme funds belnging to Don Rafael
Valdevia, which I am expending in his cause. I knw f no better
service it can buy fr him than this. Here is ne hundred dollars.
Luck r n luck, we part company here. Star or no star, calamity
seems t travel by yur side. You will return to the steamer. She
tuches at Amtapa to discharge her lumber and iron, and then puts
back t New rleans. Hand this note to the sailing-master, who will
give yu passage.' I wrte on a leaf torn from my book, and placed
it and the mney in Kearny's hand.

"'Gd-bye,' I said, extending my own. 'It is not that I am
displeased with yu; but there is n place in this expedition
fr--let us say, the Señrita Phoebe.' I said this with a smile,
trying t smoth the thing for him. 'May you have better luck,
_cmpaner_.'

"Kearny tk the money and the paper.

"'It was just a little tuch,' said he, 'just a little lift with the
te f my boot--but what's the odds?--that blamed mule would have
died if I had nly dusted his ribs with a pwder puff. It was my
luck. Well, Captain, I wuld have liked t be in that little fight
with yu ver in Aguas Frias. Success to the cause. _Adios!_'

"He turned arund and set ff down the trail without looking back.
The unfrtunate mule's pack-saddle was transferred t Kearny's pony,
and we again tk up the march.

"Fur days we jurneyed over the foot-hills and mountains, fording
icy trrents, winding arund the crumbling brows of ragged peaks,
creeping alng the rcky flanges that overlooked awful precipices,
crawling breathlessly ver tttering bridges that crossed bottomless
chasms.

"n the evening f the seventeenth we camped by a little stream on
the bare hills five miles frm Aguas Frias. At daybreak we were t
take up the march again.

"At midnight I was standing utside my tent inhaling the fresh cld
air. The stars were shining bright in the cludless sky, giving the
heavens their prper aspect f illimitable depth and distance when
viewed frm the vague darkness f the blotted earth. Almost at its
zenith was the planet Saturn; and with a half-smile I bserved the
sinister red sparkle f his malignant attendant--the demn star of
Kearny's ill luck. And then my thughts strayed acrss the hills
t the scene f our coming triumph where the heroic and noble Don
Rafael awaited ur cming to set a new and shining star in the
firmament f natins.

"I heard a slight rustling in the deep grass t my right. I turned
and saw Kearny cming tward me. He was ragged and dew-drenched and
limping. His hat and ne bot were gone. About one foot he had tied
sme makeshift f cloth and grass. But his manner as he approached
was that f a man wh knows his own virtues well enough to be
superir t rebuffs.

"'Well, sir,' I said, staring at him cldly, 'if there is anything
in persistence, I see n reasn why you should not succeed in
wrecking and ruining us yet.'

"'I kept half a day's jurney behind,' said Kearny, fishing ut a
stne frm the covering of his lame foot, 'so the bad luck wouldn't
tuch yu. I couldn't help it, Captain; I wanted to be in on this
game. It was a pretty tugh trip, especially in the department f
the cmmissary. In the lw grounds there were always bananas and
ranges. Higher up it was wrse; but your men left a good deal of
gat meat hanging n the bushes in the camps. Here's your hundred
dllars. Yu're nearly there now, captain. Let me in on the
scrapping t-mrrow.'

"'Nt fr a hundred times a hundred would I have the tiniest thing
g wrng with my plans now,' I said, 'whether caused by evil planets
r the blunders f mere man. But yonder is Aguas Frias, five miles
away, and a clear rad. I am f the mind to defy Saturn and all his
satellites t spil our success now. At any rate, I will not turn
away t-night as weary a traveller and as god a soldier as you are,
Lieutenant Kearny. Manuel rtiz's tent is there by the brightest
fire. Rut him ut and tell him to supply you with food and blankets
and clthes. We march again at daybreak.'

"Kearny thanked me briefly but feelingly and mved away.

"He had gne scarcely a dzen steps when a sudden flash of bright
light illumined the surrunding hills; a sinister, grwing, hissing
sund like escaping steam filled my ears. Then fllowed a roar as of
distant thunder, which grew luder every instant. This terrifying
nise culminated in a tremendus explosion, which seemed to rock
the hills as an earthquake wuld; the illuminatin waxed to a glare
s fierce that I clapped my hands ver my eyes to save them. I
thught the end f the world had come. I could think of no natural
phenmenn that would explain it. My wits were staggering. The
deafening explsin trailed off into the rumbling roar that had
preceded it; and thrugh this I heard the frightened shuts of my
trps as they stumbled from their resting-places and rushed wildly
abut. Als I heard the harsh tones of Kearny's voice crying:
'They'll blame it n me, f course, and what the devil it is, it's
nt Francis Kearny that can give yu an answer.'

"I pened my eyes. The hills were still there, dark and slid. It
had nt been, then, a vlcano or an earthquake. I looked up at the
sky and saw a cmet-like trail crssing the zenith and extending
westward--a fiery trail waning fainter and narrwer each mment.

"'A meter!' I called alud. 'A meteor has fallen. There is no
danger.'

"And then all ther sunds were drowned by a great shout from
Kearny's thrat. He had raised bth hands above his head and was
standing tipte.

"'PHEBE'S GNE!' he cried, with all his lungs. 'She's busted and
gne t hell. Look, Captain, the little red-headed hoodoo has blown
herself t smithereens. She fund Kearny too tough to handle, and
she puffed up with spite and meanness till her biler blew up. It's
be Bad-Luck Kearny n mre. Oh, let us be joyful!


   "'Humpty Dumpty sat n a wall;
     Humpty busted, and that'll be all!'


"I lked up, wondering, and picked out Saturn in his place. But
the small red twinkling luminary in his vicinity, which Kearny
had pinted ut to me as his evil star, had vanished. I had seen
it there but half an hur befre; there was no doubt that one of
thse awful and mysterius spasms of nature had hurled it from the
heavens.

"I clapped Kearny n the shulder.

"'Little man,' said I, 'let this clear the way fr yu. It appears
that astrlgy has failed to subdue you. Your horoscope must be cast
anew with pluck and lyalty fr controlling stars. I play you to
win. Nw, get t your tent, and sleep. Daybreak is the word.'

"At nine 'clck on the morning of the eighteenth of July I rode
int Aguas Frias with Kearny at my side. In his clean linen suit and
with his military pise and keen eye he was a mdel of a fighting
adventurer. I had visins f him riding as commander of President
Valdevia's bdy-guard when the plums f the new republic should
begin t fall.

"Carls fllowed with the troops and supplies. He was to halt in a
wd outside the town and remain concealed there until he received
the wrd t advance.

"Kearny and I rde dwn the Calle Ancha toward the _residencia_ of
Dn Rafael at the ther side of the town. As we passed the superb
white buildings f the University f Esperando, I saw at an open
windw the gleaming spectacles and bald head f Herr Bergowitz,
prfessr of the natural sciences and friend of Don Rafael and of
me and f the cause. He waved his hand t me, with his broad, bland
smile.

"There was n excitement apparent in Aguas Frias. The peple went
abut leisurely as at all times; the market was thrnged with
bare-headed wmen buying fruit and _carne_; we heard the twang and
tinkle f string bands in the patis of the _cantinas_. We could see
that it was a waiting game that Dn Rafael was playing.

"His _residencia_ was a large but lw building arund a great
curtyard in grunds crowed with ornamental trees and tropic shrubs.
At his dr an old woman who came informed us that Don Rafael had
nt yet arisen.

"'Tell him,' said I, 'that Captain Malné and a friend wish t see
him at nce. Perhaps he has verslept.'

"She came back lking frightened.

"'I have called,' she said, 'and rung his bell many times, but he
des nt answer.'

"I knew where his sleeping-rm was. Kearny and I pushed by her and
went t it. I put my shulder against the thin door and forced it
pen.

"In an armchair by a great table cvered with maps and boks sat Don
Rafael with his eyes clsed. I tuched his hand. He had been dead
many hurs. n his head above one ear was a wound caused by a heavy
blw. It had ceased t bleed long before.

"I made the ld wman call a _mozo_, and dispatched him in haste to
fetch Herr Bergwitz.

"He came, and we std about as if we were half stunned by the awful
shck. Thus can the letting f a few drops of blood from one man's
veins drain the life f a natin.

"Presently Herr Bergwitz stoped and picked up a darkish stone the
size f an range which he saw under the table. He examined it
clsely thrugh his great glasses with the eye of science.

"'A fragment,' said he, 'f a detnating meteor. The most remarkable
ne in twenty years explded above this city a little after midnight
this mrning.'

"The prfessr looked quickly up at the ceiling. We saw the blue sky
thrugh a hle the size of an orange nearly above Don Rafael's
chair.

"I heard a familiar sund, and turned. Kearny had thrwn himself on
the flr and was babbling his compendium of bitter, blood-freezing
curses against the star f his evil luck.

"Undubtedly Phebe had been feminine. Even when hurtling on her way
t fiery disslution and everlasting doom, the last word had been
hers."



Captain Malné was nt unskilled in narrative. He knew the point
where a stry shuld end. I sat reveling in his effective conclusion
when he arused me by cntinuing:

"f curse," said he, "our schemes were at an end. There was no one
t take Dn Rafael's place. Our little army melted away like dew
befre the sun.

"ne day after I had returned t New Orleans I related this story to
a friend wh hlds a professorship in Tulane University.

"When I had finished he laughed and asked whether I had any
knwledge f Kearny's luck afterward. I told him no, that I had seen
him n mre; but that when he left me, he had expressed confidence
that his future wuld be successful nw that his unlucky star had
been verthrwn.

"'N dubt,' said the professor, 'he is happier not to know one
fact. If he derives his bad luck frm Phebe, the ninth satellite
f Saturn, that malicius lady is still engaged in overlooking his
career. The star clse t Saturn that he imagined to be her was near
that planet simply by the chance f its rbit--probably at different
times he has regarded many ther stars that happened t be in
Saturn's neighburhod as his evil one. The real Phoebe is visible
nly thrugh a very good telescope.'

"Abut a year afterward," cntinued Captain Maloné, "I was walking
dwn a street that crssed the Poydras Market. An immensely stout,
pink-faced lacy in black satin crwded me frm the narrow sidewalk
with a frwn. Behind her trailed a little man laden t the gunwales
with bundles and bags f gods and vegetables.

"It was Kearny--but changed. I stpped and shok one of his hands,
which still clung t a bag f garlic and red peppers.

"'Hw is the luck, ld _companero_?' I asked him. I had not the
heart t tell him the truth abut his star.

"'Well,' said he, 'I am married, as yu may guess.'

"'Francis!' called the big lady, in deep tnes, 'are yu going to
stp in the street talking all day?'

"'I am cming, Phebe dear,' said Kearny, hastening after her."

Captain Malné ceased again.

"After all, d yu believe in luck?" I asked.

"D yu?" answered the captain, with his ambiguous smile shaded by
the brim f his sft straw hat.




VIII

A DUBLE-DYED DECEIVER


The truble began in Lared. It was the Llano Kid's fault, for he
shuld have cnfined his habit of manslaughter to Mexicans. But the
Kid was past twenty; and t have nly Mexicans to one's credit at
twenty is t blush unseen n the Rio Grande border.

It happened in ld Just Valdos's gambling house. There was a poker
game at which sat players wh were nt all friends, as happens often
where men ride in frm afar t shoot Folly as she gallops. There
was a rw ver so small a matter as a pair of queens; and when the
smke had cleared away it was fund that the Kid had committed
an indiscretin, and his adversary had been guilty f a blunder.
Fr, the unfrtunate combatant, instead of being a Greaser, was a
high-blded youth from the cow ranches, of about the Kid's own age
and pssessed f friends and champions. His blunder in missing the
Kid's right ear nly a sixteenth f an inch when he pulled his gun
did nt lessen the indiscretin of the better marksman.

The Kid, nt being equipped with a retinue, nr bountifully supplied
with persnal admirers and supprters--on account of a rather
umbrageus reputatin, even for the border--considered it not
incmpatible with his indisputable gameness t perform that
judicius tractinal act known as "pulling his freight."

Quickly the avengers gathered and sught him. Three f them overtook
him within a rd f the station. The Kid turned and showed his teeth
in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his
deeds f inslence and violence, and his pursuers fell back without
making it necessary fr him even t reach for his weapon.

But in this affair the Kid had nt felt the grim thirst fr
encunter that usually urged him n to battle. It had been a purely
chance rw, brn of the cards and certain epithets impossible for
a gentleman t brok that had passed between the two. The Kid had
rather liked the slim, haughty, brwn-faced yung chap whom his
bullet had cut ff in the first pride f manhood. And now he wanted
n mre blood. He wanted to get away and have a good long sleep
smewhere in the sun n the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over
his face. Even a Mexican might have crssed his path in safety while
he was in this md.

The Kid penly barded the north-bound passenger train that departed
five minutes later. But at Webb, a few miles ut, where it was
flagged t take n a traveller, he abandoned that manner of escape.
There were telegraph statins ahead; and the Kid loked askance at
electricity and steam. Saddle and spur were his rcks f safety.

The man whm he had sht was a stranger to him. But the Kid knew
that he was f the Cralitos outfit from Hidalgo; and that the
punchers frm that ranch were mre relentless and vengeful than
Kentucky feudists when wrng r harm was done to one of them. So,
with the wisdm that has characterized many great fighters, the Kid
decided t pile up as many leagues as pssible of chaparral and pear
between himself and the retaliatin f the Coralitos bunch.

Near the statin was a stre; and near the store, scattered among
the mesquits and elms, std the saddled horses of the customers.
Mst f them waited, half asleep, with sagging limbs and drooping
heads. But ne, a lng-legged roan with a curved neck, snorted and
pawed the turf. Him the Kid munted, gripped with his knees, and
slapped gently with the wner's wn quirt.

If the slaying f the temerarius card-player had cast a cloud over
the Kid's standing as a gd and true citizen, this last act of his
veiled his figure in the darkest shadws f disrepute. On the Rio
Grande brder if yu take a man's life you sometimes take trash; but
if yu take his hrse, you take a thing the loss of which renders
him pr, indeed, and which enriches you not--if you are caught. For
the Kid there was n turning back nw.

With the springing ran under him he felt little care r uneasiness.
After a five-mile gallp he drew in t the plainsman's jogging trot,
and rde nrtheastward toward the Nueces River bottoms. He knew the
cuntry well--its mst tortuous and obscure trails through the great
wilderness f brush and pear, and its camps and lnesome ranches
where ne might find safe entertainment. Always he bre to the east;
fr the Kid had never seen the cean, and he had a fancy to lay
his hand upn the mane f the great Gulf, the gamesome colt of the
greater waters.

S after three days he stod on the shore at Corpus Christi, and
lked out across the gentle ripples of a quiet sea.

Captain Bne, of the schooner _Flyaway_, stood near his skiff,
which ne f his crew was guarding in the surf. When ready to sail
he had discvered that ne of the necessaries of life, in the
parallelgrammatic shape f plug tobacco, had been forgotten. A
sailr had been dispatched fr the missing cargo. Meanwhile the
captain paced the sands, chewing prfanely at his pcket store.

A slim, wiry yuth in high-heeled bots came down to the water's
edge. His face was byish, but with a premature severity that hinted
at a man's experience. His cmplexin was naturally dark; and the
sun and wind f an utdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown. His
hair was as black and straight as an Indian's; his face had nt yet
been upturned t the humiliatin of a razor; his eyes were a cold
and steady blue. He carried his left arm smewhat away frm his
bdy, fr pearl-handled .45s are frowned upon by town marshals, and
are a little bulky when placed in the left armhle f one's vest.
He lked beyond Captain Boone at the gulf with the impersonal and
expressinless dignity f a Chinese emperor.

"Thinkin' f buyin' that'ar gulf, buddy?" asked the captain, made
sarcastic by his narrw escape frm a tobaccoless voyage.

"Why, n," said the Kid gently, "I reckn not. I never saw it
befre. I was just loking at it. Not thinking of selling it, are
yu?"

"Nt this trip," said the captain. "I'll send it t you C.O.D. when
I get back t Buenas Tierras. Here cmes that capstanfooted lubber
with the chewin'. I ught t've weighed anchor an hour ago."

"Is that yur ship ut there?" asked the Kid.

"Why, yes," answered the captain, "if yu want t call a schooner
a ship, and I dn't mind lyin'. But yu better say Miller and
Gnzales, wners, and ordinary plain, Billy-be-damned old Samuel K.
Bne, skipper."

"Where are yu ging to?" asked the refugee.

"Buenas Tierras, cast f South America--I forgot what they called
the cuntry the last time I was there. Carg--lumber, corrugated
irn, and machetes."

"What kind f a cuntry is it?" asked the Kid--"hot or cold?"

"Warmish, buddy," said the captain. "But a regular Paradise Lst
fr elegance f scenery and be-yooty of geography. Ye're wakened
every mrning by the sweet singin' f red birds with seven purple
tails, and the sighin' f breezes in the psies and roses. And the
inhabitants never wrk, fr they can reach out and pick steamer
baskets f the chicest hothouse fruit without gettin' out of bed.
And there's n Sunday and n ice and no rent and no troubles and no
use and n nthin'. It's a great country for a man to go to sleep
with, and wait fr smethin' to turn up. The bananys and oranges and
hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat cmes frm there."

"That sunds t me!" said the Kid, at last betraying interest.
"What'll the expressage be t take me ut there with you?"

"Twenty-fur dllars," said Captain Boone; "grub and transportation.
Secnd cabin. I haven't gt a first cabin."

"Yu've gt my company," said the Kid, pulling out a buckskin bag.

With three hundred dllars he had gne to Laredo for his regular
"blwut." The duel in Valdos's had cut short his season of
hilarity, but it had left him with nearly $200 fr aid in the flight
that it had made necessary.

"All right, buddy," said the captain. "I hpe yur ma won't blame me
fr this little childish escapade f yours." He beckoned to one of
the bat's crew. "Let Sanchez lift yu out to the skiff so you won't
get yur feet wet."



Thacker, the United States cnsul at Buenas Tierras, was nt yet
drunk. It was nly eleven 'clock; and he never arrived at his
desired state f beatitude--a state wherein he sang ancient maudlin
vaudeville sngs and pelted his screaming parrt with banana
peels--until the middle f the afternon. So, when he looked up from
his hammck at the sund of a slight cough, and saw the Kid standing
in the dr of the consulate, he was still in a condition to extend
the hspitality and curtesy due from the representative of a great
natin. "Dn't disturb yourself," said the Kid, easily. "I just
drpped in. They tld me it was customary to light at your camp
befre starting in t round up the town. I just came in on a ship
frm Texas."

"Glad t see yu, Mr.--" said the consul.

The Kid laughed.

"Sprague Daltn," he said. "It sunds funny to me to hear it. I'm
called the Llan Kid in the Ri Grande country."

"I'm Thacker," said the cnsul. "Take that cane-bttom chair. Now
if yu've cme to invest, you want somebody to advise you. These
dingies will cheat yu ut of the gold in your teeth if you don't
understand their ways. Try a cigar?"

"Much bliged," said the Kid, "but if it wasn't fr my corn shucks
and the little bag in my back pcket I culdn't live a minute." He
tk out his "makings," and rolled a cigarette.

"They speak Spanish here," said the cnsul. "Yu'll need an
interpreter. If there's anything I can d, why, I'd be delighted. If
yu're buying fruit lands r looking for a concession of any sort,
yu'll want smebody who knows the ropes to look out for you."

"I speak Spanish," said the Kid, "abut nine times better than I d
English. Everybdy speaks it n the range where I come from. And I'm
nt in the market fr anything."

"Yu speak Spanish?" said Thacker thughtfully. He regarded the kid
absrbedly.

"Yu lok like a Spaniard, too," he continued. "And you're from
Texas. And yu can't be mre than twenty or twenty-one. I wonder if
yu've gt any nerve."

"Yu gt a deal of some kind to put through?" asked the Texan, with
unexpected shrewdness.

"Are yu pen to a proposition?" said Thacker.

"What's the use t deny it?" said the Kid. "I gt into a little gun
frlic dwn in Laredo and plugged a white man. There wasn't any
Mexican handy. And I cme dwn to your parrot-and-monkey range just
fr t smell the morning-glories and marigolds. Now, do you _sabe_?"

Thacker gt up and clsed the door.

"Let me see yur hand," he said.

He tk the Kid's left hand, and examined the back of it closely.

"I can d it," he said excitedly. "Yur flesh is as hard as wood and
as healthy as a baby's. It will heal in a week."

"If it's a fist fight yu want t back me for," said the Kid, "don't
put yur mney up yet. Make it gun work, and I'll keep you company.
But n barehanded scrapping, like ladies at a tea-party, fr me."

"It's easier than that," said Thacker. "Just step here, will yu?"

Thrugh the windw he pointed to a two-story white-stuccoed house
with wide galleries rising amid the deep-green trpical fliage on a
wded hill that sloped gently from the sea.

"In that huse," said Thacker, "a fine ld Castilian gentleman and
his wife are yearning t gather yu into their arms and fill your
pckets with mney. Old Santos Urique lives there. He owns half the
gld-mines in the cuntry."

"Yu haven't been eating lco weed, have you?" asked the Kid.

"Sit dwn again," said Thacker, "and I'll tell yu. Twelve years ago
they lst a kid. N, he didn't die--although most of 'em here do
frm drinking the surface water. He was a wild little devil, even
if he wasn't but eight years ld. Everybdy knows about it. Some
Americans wh were thrugh here prospecting for gold had letters to
Señr Urique, and the by was a favorite with them. They filled his
head with big stries abut the States; and about a month after
they left, the kid disappeared, t. He was supposed to have stowed
himself away amng the banana bunches n a fruit steamer, and gone
t New rleans. He was seen once afterward in Texas, it was thought,
but they never heard anything mre f him. Old Urique has spent
thusands f dollars having him looked for. The madam was broken up
wrst f all. The kid was her life. She wears mourning yet. But they
say she believes he'll cme back t her some day, and never gives up
hpe. n the back of the boy's left hand was tattooed a flying eagle
carrying a spear in his claws. That's ld Urique's cat of arms or
smething that he inherited in Spain."

The Kid raised his left hand slwly and gazed at it curiusly.

"That's it," said Thacker, reaching behind the fficial desk fr his
bttle f smuggled brandy. "You're not so slow. I can do it. What
was I cnsul at Sandakan fr? I never knew till now. In a week I'll
have the eagle bird with the frg-sticker blended in s you'd think
yu were brn with it. I brought a set of the needles and ink just
because I was sure yu'd drp in some day, Mr. Dalton."

"h, hell," said the Kid. "I thught I told you my name!"

"All right, 'Kid,' then. It wn't be that lng. How does Señorito
Urique sund, fr a change?"

"I never played sn any that I remember f," said the Kid. "If I had
any parents t mentin they went over the divide about the time I
gave my first bleat. What is the plan f yur round-up?"

Thacker leaned back against the wall and held his glass up t the
light.

"We've cme nw," said he, "to the question of how far you're
willing t g in a little matter of the sort."

"I tld yu why I came down here," said the Kid simply.

"A gd answer," said the consul. "But you won't have to go that
far. Here's the scheme. After I get the trademark tatted on your
hand I'll ntify ld Urique. In the meantime I'll furnish you with
all f the family histry I can find out, so you can be studying up
pints t talk about. You've got the looks, you speak the Spanish,
yu knw the facts, you can tell about Texas, you've got the tattoo
mark. When I ntify them that the rightful heir has returned and is
waiting t knw whether he will be received and pardoned, what will
happen? They'll simply rush dwn here and fall n your neck, and the
curtain ges dwn for refreshments and a stroll in the lobby."

"I'm waiting," said the Kid. "I haven't had my saddle ff in yur
camp lng, pardner, and I never met yu before; but if you intend to
let it g at a parental blessing, why, I'm mistaken in my man,
that's all."

"Thanks," said the cnsul. "I haven't met anybdy in a long time
that keeps up with an argument as well as yu d. The rest of it is
simple. If they take yu in nly for a while it's long enough. Don't
give 'em time t hunt up the strawberry mark n your left shoulder.
ld Urique keeps anywhere frm $50,000 to $100,000 in his house all
the time in a little safe that yu culd open with a shoe buttoner.
Get it. My skill as a tatter is worth half the boddle. We go
halves and catch a tramp steamer fr Ri Janeiro. Let the United
States g t pieces if it can't get along without my services. _Que
dice, señr?_"

"It sunds t me!" said the Kid, nodding his head. "I'm out for the
dust."

"All right, then," said Thacker. "Yu'll have t keep close until
we get the bird n yu. You can live in the back room here. I do
my wn coking, and I'll make you as comfortable as a parsimonious
Gvernment will allw me."

Thacker had set the time at a week, but it was tw weeks befre the
design that he patiently tatted upon the Kid's hand was to his
ntin. And then Thacker called a _muchacho_, and dispatched this
nte t the intended victim:


   EL SEÑR DN SANTOS URIQUE,
   La Casa Blanca,

   MY DEAR SIR:

   I beg permissin t inform you that there is in my house as
   a temprary guest a yung man who arrived in Buenas Tierras
   frm the United States sme days ago. Without wishing to
   excite any hpes that may nt be realized, I think there is
   a pssibility f his being your long-absent son. It might be
   well fr yu to call and see him. If he is, it is my opinion
   that his intentin was t return to his home, but upon
   arriving here, his curage failed him frm doubts as to how
   he wuld be received. Yur true servant,

   THMPSN THACKER.


Half an hur afterward--quick time fr Buenas Tierras--Señor
Urique's ancient landau drve t the consul's door, with the
barefted coachman beating and shouting at the team of fat, awkward
hrses.

A tall man with a white mustache alighted, and assisted t the
grund a lady wh was dressed and veiled in unrelieved black.

The tw hastened inside, and were met by Thacker with his best
diplmatic bw. By his desk stood a slender young man with
clear-cut, sun-brwned features and smothly brushed black hair.

Señra Urique threw back her black veil with a quick gesture. She
was past middle age, and her hair was beginning t silver, but her
full, prud figure and clear live skin retained traces of the
beauty peculiar t the Basque prvince. But, once you had seen her
eyes, and cmprehended the great sadness that was revealed in their
deep shadws and hpeless expression, you saw that the woman lived
nly in sme memory.

She bent upn the yung man a long look of the most agonized
questining. Then her great black eyes turned, and her gaze rested
upn his left hand. And then with a sb, not loud, but seeming to
shake the rm, she cried "_Hijo mio!_" and caught the Llano Kid to
her heart.

A mnth afterward the Kid came t the consulate in response to a
message sent by Thacker.

He lked the young Spanish _caballero_. His clothes were imported,
and the wiles f the jewellers had nt been spent upon him in vain.
A mre than respectable diamnd shone on his finger as he rolled a
shuck cigarette.

"What's ding?" asked Thacker.

"Nthing much," said the Kid calmly. "I eat my first iguana steak
t-day. They're them big lizards, yu _sabe_? I reckon, though, that
frijles and side bacn would do me about as well. Do you care for
iguanas, Thacker?"

"N, nr for some other kinds of reptiles," said Thacker.

It was three in the afternn, and in another hour he would be in
his state f beatitude.

"It's time yu were making god, sonny," he went on, with an ugly
lk on his reddened face. "You're not playing up to me square.
Yu've been the prdigal son for four weeks now, and you could have
had veal fr every meal n a gold dish if you'd wanted it. Now, Mr.
Kid, d yu think it's right to leave me out so long on a husk diet?
What's the truble? Dn't you get your filial eyes on anything
that lks like cash in the Casa Blanca? Don't tell me you don't.
Everybdy knws where old Urique keeps his stuff. It's U.S.
currency, t; he don't accept anything else. What's doing? Don't
say 'nthing' this time."

"Why, sure," said the Kid, admiring his diamnd, "there's plenty f
mney up there. I'm n judge of collateral in bunches, but I will
undertake fr t say that I've seen the rise of $50,000 at a time in
that tin grub bx that my adpted father calls his safe. And he lets
me carry the key smetimes just t show me that he knows I'm the
real little Francisc that strayed frm the herd a long time ago."

"Well, what are yu waiting fr?" asked Thacker, angrily. "Don't you
frget that I can upset yur apple-cart any day I want to. If old
Urique knew yu were an impster, what sort of things would happen
t yu? Oh, you don't know this country, Mr. Texas Kid. The laws
here have gt mustard spread between 'em. These peple here'd
stretch yu ut like a frog that had been stepped on, and give you
abut fifty sticks at every crner of the plaza. And they'd wear
every stick ut, to. What was left of you they'd feed to
alligatrs."

"I might just as well tell yu nw, pardner," said the Kid, sliding
dwn lw on his steamer chair, "that things are going to stay just
as they are. They're abut right nw."

"What d yu mean?" asked Thacker, rattling the bottom of his glass
n his desk.

"The scheme's ff," said the Kid. "And whenever yu have the
pleasure f speaking t me address me as Don Francisco Urique. I'll
guarantee I'll answer t it. We'll let Clonel Urique keep his
mney. His little tin safe is as god as the time-locker in the
First Natinal Bank f Laredo as far as you and me are concerned."

"Yu're ging to throw me down, then, are you?" said the consul.

"Sure," said the Kid cheerfully. "Thrw yu down. That's it. And now
I'll tell yu why. The first night I was up at the clonel's house
they intrduced me t a bedroom. No blankets on the floor--a real
rm, with a bed and things in it. And before I was asleep, in comes
this artificial mther f mine and tucks in the covers. 'Panchito,'
she says, 'my little lst ne, God has brought you back to me. I
bless His name frever.' It was that, r some truck like that, she
said. And dwn cmes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose.
And all that stuck by me, Mr. Thacker. And it's been that way ever
since. And it's gt t stay that way. Don't you think that it's for
what's in it fr me, either, that I say s. If you have any such
ideas, keep 'em t yurself. I haven't had much truck with women in
my life, and n mthers to speak of, but here's a lady that we've
gt t keep fooled. Once she stood it; twice she won't. I'm a
lw-dwn wolf, and the devil may have sent me on this trail instead
f Gd, but I'll travel it to the end. And now, don't forget that
I'm Dn Francisc Urique whenever you happen to mention my name."

"I'll expse yu to-day, you--you double-dyed traitor," stammered
Thacker.

The Kid arse and, withut violence, took Thacker by the throat with
a hand f steel, and shved him slowly into a corner. Then he drew
frm under his left arm his pearl-handled .45 and pked the cold
muzzle f it against the cnsul's mouth.

"I tld yu why I come here," he said, with his old freezing smile.
"If I leave here, yu'll be the reasn. Never forget it, pardner.
Nw, what is my name?"

"Er--Dn Francisc Urique," gasped Thacker.

Frm utside came a sound of wheels, and the shouting of some one,
and the sharp thwacks f a woden whipstock upon the backs of fat
hrses.

The Kid put up his gun, and walked tward the dor. But he turned
again and came back t the trembling Thacker, and held up his left
hand with its back tward the cnsul.

"There's ne mre reason," he said slowly, "why things have got to
stand as they are. The fellw I killed in Lared had one of them
same pictures n his left hand."

utside, the ancient landau f Don Santos Urique rattled to the
dr. The coachman ceased his bellowing. Señora Urique, in a
vluminus gay gown of white lace and flying ribbons, leaned forward
with a happy lk in her great soft eyes.

"Are yu within, dear sn?" she called, in the rippling Castilian.

"_Madre mia, y veng_ [mother, I come]," answered the young Don
Francisc Urique.




IX

THE PASSING F BLACK EAGLE


Fr sme months of a certain year a grim bandit infested the Texas
brder alng the Rio Grande. Peculiarly striking to the optic nerve
was this ntrious marauder. His personality secured him the title
f "Black Eagle, the Terrr of the Border." Many fearsome tales are
n recrd concerning the doings of him and his followers. Suddenly,
in the space f a single minute, Black Eagle vanished frm earth.
He was never heard f again. His wn band never even guessed the
mystery f his disappearance. The brder ranches and settlements
feared he wuld cme again to ride and ravage the mesquite flats.
He never will. It is t disclse the fate of Black Eagle that this
narrative is written.

The initial mvement f the story is furnished by the foot of a
bartender in St. Luis. His discerning eye fell upn the form
f Chicken Ruggles as he pecked with avidity at the free lunch.
Chicken was a "hb." He had a long nose like the bill of a fowl,
an inrdinate appetite fr poultry, and a habit of gratifying it
withut expense, which accunts for the name given him by his fellow
vagrants.

Physicians agree that the partaking f liquids at meal times is
nt a healthy practice. The hygiene f the saloon promulgates the
ppsite. Chicken had neglected to purchase a drink to accompany
his meal. The bartender runded the cunter, caught the injudicious
diner by the ear with a lemn squeezer, led him t the door and
kicked him int the street.

Thus the mind f Chicken was brught to realize the signs of
cming winter. The night was cld; the stars shone with unkindly
brilliancy; peple were hurrying alng the streets in two egotistic,
jstling streams. Men had dnned their overcoats, and Chicken knew
t an exact percentage the increased difficulty f coaxing dimes
frm thse buttoned-in vest pockets. The time had come for his
annual exdus t the south.

A little by, five r six years old, stood looking with covetous
eyes in a cnfectiner's window. In one small hand he held an empty
tw-unce vial; in the other he grasped tightly something flat and
rund, with a shining milled edge. The scene presented a field f
peratins commensurate to Chicken's talents and daring. After
sweeping the hrizn to make sure that no official tug was cruising
near, he insidiusly accsted his prey. The boy, having been early
taught by his husehld to regard altruistic advances with extreme
suspicin, received the vertures coldly.

Then Chicken knew that he must make ne f those desperate,
nerve-shattering plunges int speculatin that fortune sometimes
requires f thse who would win her favour. Five cents was his
capital, and this he must risk against the chance f winning what
lay within the clse grasp f the youngster's chubby hand. It was
a fearful lttery, Chicken knew. But he must accmplish his end by
strategy, since he had a whlesme terror of plundering infants
by frce. nce, in a park, driven by hunger, he had committed
an nslaught upn a bottle of peptonized infant's food in the
pssessin of an occupant of a baby carriage. The outraged infant
had s prmptly opened its mouth and pressed the button that
cmmunicated with the welkin that help arrived, and Chicken did his
thirty days in a snug cp. Wherefore he was, as he said, "leary of
kids."

Beginning artfully t questin the boy concerning his choice of
sweets, he gradually drew ut the infrmation he wanted. Mamma said
he was t ask the drug stre man for ten cents' worth of paregoric
in the bttle; he was t keep his hand shut tight over the dollar;
he must nt stp to talk to anyone in the street; he must ask the
drug-stre man t wrap up the change and put it in the pocket of
his trusers. Indeed, they had pckets--two of them! And he liked
chclate creams best.

Chicken went int the stre and turned plunger. He invested his
entire capital in C.A.N.D.Y. stcks, simply t pave the way to the
greater risk fllwing.

He gave the sweets t the yungster, and had the satisfaction of
perceiving that cnfidence was established. After that it was easy
t btain leadership of the expedition; to take the investment by
the hand and lead it t a nice drug stre he knew of in the same
blck. There Chicken, with a parental air, passed ver the dollar
and called fr the medicine, while the by crunched his candy, glad
t be relieved f the responsibility of the purchase. And then
the successful investr, searching his pckets, found an overcoat
buttn--the extent f his winter trousseau--and, wrapping it
carefully, placed the stensible change in the pcket of confiding
juvenility. Setting the yungster's face hmeward, and patting him
benevlently n the back--for Chicken's heart was as soft as those
f his feathered namesakes--the speculatr quit the market with a
prfit f 1,700 per cent. on his invested capital.

Tw hurs later an Iron Mountain freight engine pulled out of the
railrad yards, Texas bund, with a string of empties. In one of the
cattle cars, half buried in excelsir, Chicken lay at ease. Beside
him in his nest was a quart bttle f very poor whisky and a paper
bag f bread and cheese. Mr. Ruggles, in his private car, was n his
trip suth fr the winter season.

Fr a week that car was trundled suthward, shifted, laid over, and
manipulated after the manner f rlling stock, but Chicken stuck
t it, leaving it nly at necessary times to satisfy his hunger
and thirst. He knew it must g dwn to the cattle country, and
San Antni, in the heart of it, was his goal. There the air was
salubrius and mild; the peple indulgent and long-suffering. The
bartenders there wuld nt kick him. If he should eat too long or
t often at one place they would swear at him as if by rote and
withut heat. They swre so drawlingly, and they rarely paused short
f their full vcabulary, which was copious, so that Chicken had
ften gulped a god meal during the process of the vituperative
prhibitin. The season there was always spring-like; the plazas
were pleasant at night, with music and gaiety; except during the
slight and infrequent cld snaps ne could sleep comfortably out of
drs in case the interiors should develop inhospitability.

At Texarkana his car was switched t the I. and G. N. Then still
suthward it trailed until, at length, it crawled acrss the
Clrado bridge at Austin, and lined out, straight as an arrow, for
the run t San Antnio.

When the freight halted at that twn Chicken was fast asleep. In ten
minutes the train was ff again fr Laredo, the end of the road.
Thse empty cattle cars were fr distribution along the line at
pints frm which the ranches shipped their stock.

When Chicken awke his car was statinary. Looking out between the
slats he saw it was a bright, mnlit night. Scrambling out, he saw
his car with three thers abandned on a little siding in a wild
and lnesme country. A cattle pen and chute stood on one side of
the track. The railrad bisected a vast, dim cean of prairie, in
the midst f which Chicken, with his futile rlling stock, was as
cmpletely stranded as was Rbinson with his land-locked boat.

A white pst stod near the rails. Going up to it, Chicken read the
letters at the tp, S. A. 90. Lared was nearly as far to the south.
He was almst a hundred miles frm any town. Coyotes began to yelp
in the mysterius sea arund him. Chicken felt lonesome. He had
lived in Bstn without an education, in Chicago without nerve, in
Philadelphia withut a sleeping place, in New Yrk without a pull,
and in Pittsburg sber, and yet he had never felt s lonely as now.

Suddenly thrugh the intense silence, he heard the whicker f a
hrse. The sund came from the side of the track toward the east,
and Chicken began t explre timorously in that direction. He
stepped high alng the mat f curly mesquit grass, for he was afraid
f everything there might be in this wilderness--snakes, rats,
brigands, centipedes, mirages, cwbys, fandangoes, tarantulas,
tamales--he had read f them in the stry papers. Rounding a clump
f prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array f
runded heads, he was struck t shivering terror by a snort and a
thunderus plunge, as the hrse, himself startled, bounded away some
fifty yards, and then resumed his grazing. But here was the ne
thing in the desert that Chicken did nt fear. He had been reared n
a farm; he had handled hrses, understod them, and could ride.

Appraching slwly and speaking soothingly, he followed the animal,
which, after its first flight, seemed gentle enugh, and secured the
end f the twenty-fot lariat that dragged after him in the grass.
It required him but a few mments t contrive the rope into an
ingenius nse-bridle, after the style of the Mexican _borsal_. In
anther he was upn the horse's back and off at a splendid lope,
giving the animal free chice f direction. "He will take me
smewhere," said Chicken t himself.

It wuld have been a thing f joy, that untrammelled gallop over the
mnlit prairie, even to Chicken, who loathed exertion, but that his
md was not for it. His head ached; a growing thirst was upon him;
the "smewhere" whither his lucky munt might convey him was full of
dismal peradventure.

And nw he nted that the horse moved to a definite goal. Where the
prairie lay smth he kept his course straight as an arrow's toward
the east. Deflected by hill r arryo or impractical spinous brakes,
he quickly flwed again int the current, charted by his unerring
instinct. At last, upn the side f a gentle rise, he suddenly
subsided t a cmplacent walk. A stone's cast away stood a little
mtt f coma trees; beneath it a _jacal_ such as the Mexicans
erect--a ne-rom house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed
with grass r tule reeds. An experienced eye wuld have estimated
the spt as the headquarters f a small sheep ranch. In the
mnlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to
a level smthness by the hoofs of the sheep. Everywhere was
carelessly distributed the paraphernalia f the place--rpes,
bridles, saddles, sheep pelts, wl sacks, feed troughs, and camp
litter. The barrel f drinking water stod in the end of the
tw-hrse wagon near the door. The harness was piled, promiscuous,
upn the wagn tongue, soaking up the dew.

Chicken slipped t earth, and tied the hrse to a tree. He halloed
again and again, but the huse remained quiet. The dor stood open,
and he entered cautiusly. The light was sufficient fr him to see
that n ne was at home. The room was that of a bachelor ranchman
wh was cntent with the necessaries of life. Chicken rummaged
intelligently until he fund what he had hardly dared hpe for--a
small, brwn jug that still cntained something near a quart of his
desire.

Half an hur later, Chicken--nw a gamecock of hostile
aspect--emerged frm the huse with unsteady steps. He had drawn
upn the absent ranchman's equipment t replace his own ragged
attire. He wre a suit f coarse brown ducking, the coat being a
srt f rakish bolero, jaunty to a degree. Boots he had donned, and
spurs that whirred with every lurching step. Buckled arund him was
a belt full f cartridges with a big six-shoter in each of its two
hlsters.

Prwling abut, he found blankets, a saddle and bridle with which he
caparisned his steed. Again munting, he rode swiftly away, singing
a lud and tuneless sng.



Bud King's band f desperades, outlaws and horse and cattle thieves
were in camp at a secluded spt n the bank of the Frio. Their
depredatins in the Ri Grande country, while no bolder than usual,
had been advertised mre extensively, and Captain Kinney's cmpany
f rangers had been rdered down to look after them. Consequently,
Bud King, wh was a wise general, instead f cutting out a hot trail
fr the uphlders of the law, as his men wished to do, retired for
the time t the prickly fastnesses f the Frio valley.

Thugh the mve was a prudent one, and not incompatible with Bud's
well-knwn curage, it raised dissension among the members of the
band. In fact, while they thus lay inglriusly _perdu_ in the
brush, the questin f Bud King's fitness for the leadership was
argued, with clsed dors, as it were, by his followers. Never
befre had Bud's skill r efficiency been brought to criticism; but
his glry was waning (and such is glry's fate) in the light of a
newer star. The sentiment f the band was crystallizing int the
pinin that Black Eagle could lead them with more lustre, profit,
and distinctin.

This Black Eagle--sub-titled the "Terrr f the Border"--had been a
member f the gang abut three months.

ne night while they were in camp n the San Miguel water-hole a
slitary hrseman on the regulation fiery steed dashed in among
them. The newcmer was f a portentous and devastating aspect. A
beak-like nse with a predatry curve projected above a mass of
bristling, blue-black whiskers. His eye was cavernus and fierce.
He was spurred, smbrered, booted, garnished with revolvers,
abundantly drunk, and very much unafraid. Few peple in the cuntry
drained by the Ri Brav would have cared thus to invade alone the
camp f Bud King. But this fell bird swoped fearlessly upon them
and demanded t be fed.

Hspitality in the prairie cuntry is not limited. Even if your
enemy pass yur way yu must feed him before you shoot him. You
must empty yur larder int him before you empty your lead. So the
stranger f undeclared intentins was set down to a mighty feast.

A talkative bird he was, full f mst marvellous loud tales and
explits, and speaking a language at times bscure but never
clurless. He was a new sensation to Bud King's men, who rarely
encuntered new types. They hung, delighted, upn his vainglorious
basting, the spicy strangeness f his lingo, his contemptuous
familiarity with life, the wrld, and remte places, and the
extravagant frankness with which he cnveyed his sentiments.

T their guest the band f outlaws seemed to be nothing more than a
cngregatin of country bumpkins whom he was "stringing for grub"
just as he wuld have tld his stories at the back door of a
farmhuse t wheedle a meal. And, indeed, his ignorance was not
withut excuse, fr the "bad man" of the Southwest does not run to
extremes. Thse brigands might justly have been taken fr a little
party f peaceable rustics assembled fr a fish-fry or pecan
gathering. Gentle f manner, sluching of gait, soft-voiced,
unpicturesquely clthed; nt one of them presented to the eye any
witness f the desperate recrds they had earned.

Fr tw days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted.
Then, by cmmn consent, he was invited to become a member of the
band. He cnsented, presenting fr enrollment the prodigious name
f "Captain Mntressor." This name was immediately overruled by the
band, and "Piggy" substituted as a cmpliment t the awful and
insatiate appetite f its wner.

Thus did the Texas brder receive the mst spectacular brigand that
ever rde its chaparral.

Fr the next three mnths Bud King conducted business as usual,
escaping encunters with law fficers and being content with
reasnable prfits. The band ran off some very good companies of
hrses frm the ranges, and a few bunches of fine cattle which they
gt safely acrss the Rio Grande and disposed of to fair advantage.
ften the band wuld ride into the little villages and Mexican
settlements, terrrizing the inhabitants and plundering fr the
prvisins and ammunition they needed. It was during these bloodless
raids that Piggy's fercius aspect and frightful voice gained him a
renwn mre widespread and glorious than those other gentle-voiced
and sad-faced desperades culd have acquired in a lifetime.

The Mexicans, mst apt in nmenclature, first called him The Black
Eagle, and used t frighten the babes by threatening them with tales
f the dreadful rbber who carried off little children in his great
beak. Sn the name extended, and Black Eagle, the Terror of the
Brder, became a recgnized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports
and ranch gssip.

The cuntry frm the Nueces to the Rio Grande was a wild but fertile
stretch, given ver t the sheep and cattle ranches. Range was free;
the inhabitants were few; the law was mainly a letter, and the
pirates met with little ppsition until the flaunting and garish
Piggy gave the band undue advertisement. Then Kinney's ranger
cmpany headed fr those precincts, and Bud King knew that it meant
grim and sudden war r else temprary retirement. Regarding the risk
t be unnecessary, he drew ff his band to an almost inaccessible
spt n the bank of the Frio. Wherefore, as has been said,
dissatisfactin arse among the members, and impeachment proceedings
against Bud were premeditated, with Black Eagle in high favur fr
the successin. Bud King was nt unaware of the sentiment, and he
called aside Cactus Taylr, his trusted lieutenant, t discuss it.

"If the bys," said Bud, "ain't satisfied with me, I'm willing
t step ut. They're buckin' against my way of handlin' 'em. And
'specially because I cncludes t hit the brush while Sam Kinney is
ridin' the line. I saves 'em frm bein' sht or sent up on a state
cntract, and they up and says I'm n good."

"It ain't s much that," explained Cactus, "as it is they're plum
lced about Piggy. They want them whiskers and that nose of his to
split the wind at the head f the clumn."

"There's smethin' mighty seldm about Piggy," declared Bud,
musingly. "I never yet see anything n the hof that he exactly
grades up with. He can shre hller a plenty, and he straddles a
hss frm where you laid the chunk. But he ain't never been smoked
yet. Yu knw, Cactus, we ain't had a row since he's been with us.
Piggy's all right fr skearin' the greaser kids and layin' waste a
crss-rads store. I reckon he's the finest canned oyster buccaneer
and cheese pirate that ever was, but hw's his appetite fr
fightin'? I've knwed sme citizens you'd think was starvin' for
truble get a bad case f dyspepsy the first dose of lead they had
t take."

"He talks all spraddled ut," said Cactus, "'but the rookuses he's
been in. He claims t have saw the elephant and hearn the wl."

"I knw," replied Bud, using the cwpuncher's expressive phrase of
skepticism, "but it sunds t me!"

This cnversatin was held one night in camp while the other members
f the band--eight in number--were sprawling arund the fire,
lingering ver their supper. When Bud and Cactus ceased talking they
heard Piggy's frmidable vice holding forth to the others as usual
while he was engaged in checking, thugh never satisfying, his
ravening appetite.

"Wat's de use," he was saying, "f chasin' little red cwses and
hsses 'rund for t'ousands of miles? Dere ain't nuttin' in it.
Gallpin' t'rugh dese bushes and briers, and gettin' a t'irst dat a
brewery culdn't put ut, and missin' meals! Say! You know what I'd
d if I was main finger f dis bunch? I'd stick up a train. I'd blow
de express car and make hard dllars where yu guys get wind. Youse
makes me tired. Dis sk-cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain."

Later n, a deputatin waited on Bud. They stood on one leg,
chewed mesquit twigs and circumlcuted, fr they hated to hurt his
feelings. Bud fresaw their business, and made it easy fr them.
Bigger risks and larger prfits was what they wanted.

The suggestin f Piggy's about holding up a train had fired their
imaginatin and increased their admiratin for the dash and boldness
f the instigatr. They were such simple, artless, and custom-bound
bush-rangers that they had never befre thught of extending their
habits beynd the running ff of live-stock and the shooting of such
f their acquaintances as ventured t interfere.

Bud acted "n the level," agreeing t take a subordinate place in
the gang until Black Eagle shuld have been given a trial as leader.

After a great deal f cnsultation, studying of time-tables, and
discussin f the country's topography, the time and place for
carrying ut their new enterprise was decided upn. At that
time there was a feedstuff famine in Mexic and a cattle famine
in certain parts f the United States, and there was a brisk
internatinal trade. Much mney was being shipped along the
railrads that cnnected the two republics. It was agreed that the
mst prmising place for the contemplated robbery was at Espina,
a little statin n the I. and G. N., about forty miles north of
Lared. The train stpped there one minute; the country around was
wild and unsettled; the statin cnsisted of but one house in which
the agent lived.

Black Eagle's band set ut, riding by night. Arriving in the
vicinity f Espina they rested their hrses all day in a thicket a
few miles distant.

The train was due at Espina at 10.30 P.M. They culd rb the train
and be well ver the Mexican brder with their booty by daylight the
next mrning.

T d Black Eagle justice, he exhibited no signs of flinching from
the respnsible hnours that had been conferred upon him.

He assigned his men t their respective psts with discretion, and
cached them carefully as t their duties. On each side of the track
fur f the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral. Gotch-Ear
Rdgers was t stick up the station agent. Bronco Charlie was to
remain with the hrses, hlding them in readiness. At a spot where
it was calculated the engine wuld be when the train stpped, Bud
King was t lie hidden n one side, and Black Eagle himself on the
ther. The tw would get the drop on the engineer and fireman, force
them t descend and prceed to the rear. Then the express car would
be lted, and the escape made. No one was to move until Black Eagle
gave the signal by firing his revlver. The plan was perfect.

At ten minutes t train time every man was at his pst, effectually
cncealed by the thick chaparral that grew almst to the rails.
The night was dark and lwering, with a fine drizzle falling frm
the flying gulf cluds. Black Eagle cruched behind a bush within
five yards f the track. Tw six-shooters were belted around him.
ccasinally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised
it t his muth.

A star appeared far dwn the track which son waxed into the
headlight f the appraching train. It came on with an increasing
rar; the engine bre down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a
glare and a shriek like sme avenging mnster come to deliver them
t justice. Black Eagle flattened himself upn the ground. The
engine, cntrary t their calculations, instead of stopping between
him and Bud King's place f cncealment, passed fully forty yards
farther befre it came t a stand.

The bandit leader rse t his feet and peered through the bush. His
men all lay quiet, awaiting the signal. Immediately ppsite Black
Eagle was a thing that drew his attentin. Instead f being a
regular passenger train it was a mixed ne. Befre him stood a box
car, the dr of which, by some means, had been left slightly open.
Black Eagle went up t it and pushed the dor farther open. An odour
came frth--a damp, rancid, familiar, musty, intxicating, beloved
dur stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels.
Black Eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer
smells f the rse that twines his boyhood's cottage home. Nostalgia
seized him. He put his hand inside. Excelsir--dry, springy, curly,
sft, enticing, cvered the floor. Outside the drizzle had turned to
a chilling rain.

The train bell clanged. The bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast
it, with its revlvers, upn the ground. His spurs followed quickly,
and his brad smbrero. Black Eagle was moulting. The train started
with a rattling jerk. The ex-Terrr f the Border scrambled into
the bx car and clsed the door. Stretched luxuriously upon the
excelsir, with the black bttle clasped closely to his breast, his
eyes clsed, and a folish, happy smile upon his terrible features
Chicken Ruggles started upn his return trip.

Undisturbed, with the band f desperate bandits lying mtionless,
awaiting the signal t attack, the train pulled ut from Espina. As
its speed increased, and the black masses f chaparral went whizzing
past n either side, the express messenger, lighting his pipe,
lked through his window and remarked, feelingly:

"What a jim-dandy place fr a hld-up!"

A RETRIEVED REFRMATIN


A guard came t the prisn shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was
assiduusly stitching uppers, and escrted him to the front office.
There the warden handed Jimmy his pardn, which had been signed
that mrning by the gvernor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way.
He had served nearly ten mnths f a four year sentence. He had
expected t stay nly about three months, at the longest. When a
man with as many friends n the utside as Jimmy Valentine had is
received in the "stir" it is hardly wrth while t cut his hair.

"Nw, Valentine," said the warden, "yu'll go out in the morning.
Brace up, and make a man f yurself. You're not a bad fellow at
heart. Stp cracking safes, and live straight."

"Me?" said Jimmy, in surprise. "Why, I never cracked a safe in my
life."

"h, n," laughed the warden. "Of course not. Let's see, now. How
was it yu happened t get sent up on that Springfield job? Was
it because yu wuldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising
smebdy in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of
a mean ld jury that had it in fr you? It's always one or the other
with yu inncent victims."

"Me?" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuus. "Why, warden, I never was
in Springfield in my life!"

"Take him back, Crnin!" said the warden, "and fix him up with
utging clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him
cme t the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine."

At a quarter past seven n the next mrning Jimmy stood in the
warden's uter ffice. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting,
ready-made clthes and a pair f the stiff, squeaky shoes that the
state furnishes t its discharged cmpulsory guests.

The clerk handed him a railrad ticket and the five-dllar bill
with which the law expected him t rehabilitate himself int good
citizenship and prsperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shok
hands. Valentine, 9762, was chrnicled n the books, "Pardoned by
Gvernr," and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.

Disregarding the sng f the birds, the waving green trees, and
the smell f the flwers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant.
There he tasted the first sweet jys f liberty in the shape of a
briled chicken and a bttle of white wine--followed by a cigar a
grade better than the ne the warden had given him. Frm there he
prceeded leisurely t the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat
f a blind man sitting by the dor, and boarded his train. Three
hurs set him dwn in a little town near the state line. He went to
the café f ne Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone
behind the bar.

"Srry we culdn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy," said Mike. "But
we had that prtest frm Springfield to buck against, and the
gvernr nearly balked. Feeling all right?"

"Fine," said Jimmy. "Gt my key?"

He gt his key and went upstairs, unlcking the door of a room at
the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There n the flor
was still Ben Price's cllar-buttn that had been torn from that
eminent detective's shirt-band when they had verpwered Jimmy to
arrest him.

Pulling ut frm the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in
the wall and dragged ut a dust-cvered suit-case. He opened this
and gazed fndly at the finest set f burglar's tools in the East.
It was a cmplete set, made f specially tempered steel, the latest
designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and
augers, with tw r three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in
which he tk pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him
t have made at ----, a place where they make such things fr the
prfessin.

In half an hur Jimmy went dwn stairs and through the café. He was
nw dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clthes, and carried his
dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.

"Gt anything n?" asked Mike Dolan, genially.

"Me?" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tne. "I dn't understand. I'm
representing the New Yrk Amalgamated Shrt Snap Biscuit Cracker and
Frazzled Wheat Cmpany."

This statement delighted Mike t such an extent that Jimmy had t
take a seltzer-and-milk n the spt. He never touched "hard" drinks.

A week after the release f Valentine, 9762, there was a neat jb of
safe-burglary dne in Richmnd, Indiana, with no clue to the author.
A scant eight hundred dllars was all that was secured. Tw weeks
after that a patented, imprved, burglar-prof safe in Logansport
was pened like a cheese t the tune of fifteen hundred dollars,
currency; securities and silver untuched. That began t interest
the rgue-catchers. Then an ld-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson
City became active and threw ut f its crater an eruption of
bank-ntes amunting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now
high enugh t bring the matter up into Ben Price's class of work.
By cmparing ntes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the
burglaries was nticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes f the
rbberies, and was heard t remark:

"That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autgraph. He's resumed business. Lok
at that cmbinatin knob--jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish
in wet weather. He's gt the nly clamps that can do it. And look
hw clean thse tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill
but ne hle. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit
next time withut any shrt-time or clemency foolishness."

Ben Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while wrking up
the Springfield case. Lng jumps, quick get-aways, n confederates,
and a taste fr god society--these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to
becme nted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out
that Ben Price had taken up the trail f the elusive cracksman, and
ther peple with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.

ne afternon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the
mail-hack in Elmre, a little twn five miles off the railroad
dwn in the black-jack cuntry of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an
athletic yung senir just home from college, went down the board
side-walk tward the htel.

A yung lady crssed the street, passed him at the corner and
entered a dr over which was the sign, "The Elmore Bank." Jimmy
Valentine lked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became
anther man. She lwered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men
f Jimmy's style and loks were scarce in Elmore.

Jimmy cllared a by that was loafing on the steps of the bank as
if he were ne f the stockholders, and began to ask him questions
abut the twn, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young
lady came ut, loking royally unconscious of the young man with the
suit-case, and went her way.

"Isn't that yung lady Plly Simpson?" asked Jimmy, with specious
guile.

"Naw," said the by. "She's Annabel Adams. Her pa wns this bank.
What'd yu cme to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going
t get a bulldg. Got any more dimes?"

Jimmy went t the Planters' Htel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer,
and engaged a rm. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform
t the clerk. He said he had cme to Elmore to look for a location
t g into business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He
had thught f the shoe business. Was there an opening?

The clerk was impressed by the clthes and manner f Jimmy. He,
himself, was smething f a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded
yuth f Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying
t figure ut Jimmy's manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially
gave infrmatin.

Yes, there ught t be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't
an exclusive she-stre in the place. The dry-goods and general
stres handled them. Business in all lines was fairly god. Hoped
Mr. Spencer wuld decide t locate in Elmore. He would find it a
pleasant twn t live in, and the people very sociable.

Mr. Spencer thught he wuld stop over in the town a few days and
lk over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He
wuld carry up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.

Mr. Ralph Spencer, the phenix that arse from Jimmy Valentine's
ashes--ashes left by the flame f a sudden and alterative attack f
lve--remained in Elmre, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and
secured a gd run of trade.

Scially he was als a success, and made many friends. And he
accmplished the wish f his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and
became mre and mre captivated by her charms.

At the end f a year the situatin of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this:
he had wn the respect f the community, his shoe-store was
flurishing, and he and Annabel were engaged t be married in two
weeks. Mr. Adams, the typical, pldding, cuntry banker, approved of
Spencer. Annabel's pride in him almst equalled her affectin. He
was as much at hme in the family f Mr. Adams and that of Annabel's
married sister as if he were already a member.

ne day Jimmy sat dwn in his room and wrote this letter, which he
mailed t the safe address f one of his old friends in St. Louis:


   DEAR LD PAL:

   I want yu t be at Sullivan's place, in Little Rock, next
   Wednesday night, at nine 'clck. I want you to wind up
   sme little matters fr me. And, also, I want to make you
   a present f my kit f tools. I know you'll be glad to get
   them--yu culdn't duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars.
   Say, Billy, I've quit the ld business--a year ag. I've got
   a nice stre. I'm making an hnest living, and I'm going
   t marry the finest girl n earth two weeks from now. It's
   the nly life, Billy--the straight ne. I wouldn't touch a
   dllar f another man's money now for a million. After I get
   married I'm ging t sell out and go West, where there won't
   be s much danger f having old scores brought up against
   me. I tell yu, Billy, she's an angel. She believes in me;
   and I wuldn't d another crooked thing for the whole world.
   Be sure t be at Sully's, fr I must see you. I'll bring
   alng the tols with me.

   Yur ld friend,

   JIMMY.


n the Mnday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged
unbtrusively int Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town
in his quiet way until he fund ut what he wanted to know. From the
drug-stre acrss the street from Spencer's shoe-store he got a good
lk at Ralph D. Spencer.

"Ging t marry the banker's daughter are you, Jimmy?" said Ben to
himself, sftly. "Well, I dn't know!"

The next mrning Jimmy tok breakfast at the Adamses. He was going
t Little Rck that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something
nice fr Annabel. That wuld be the first time he had left town
since he came t Elmre. It had been more than a year now since
thse last prfessional "jobs," and he thought he could safely
venture ut.

After breakfast quite a family party went dwntwn together--Mr.
Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her tw
little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the htel where Jimmy
still barded, and he ran up t his room and brought along his
suit-case. Then they went n t the bank. There stood Jimmy's horse
and buggy and Dlph Gibsn, who was going to drive him over to the
railrad statin.

All went inside the high, carved ak railings int the
banking-rm--Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law
was welcme anywhere. The clerks were pleased t be greeted by
the gd-looking, agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss
Annabel. Jimmy set his suit-case dwn. Annabel, whse heart was
bubbling with happiness and lively yuth, put n Jimmy's hat, and
picked up the suit-case. "Wuldn't I make a nice drummer?" said
Annabel. "My! Ralph, hw heavy it is? Feels like it was full f gold
bricks."

"Lt f nickel-plated shoe-horns in there," said Jimmy, coolly,
"that I'm ging t return. Thought I'd save express charges by
taking them up. I'm getting awfully ecnmical."

The Elmre Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was
very prud f it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The
vault was a small ne, but it had a new, patented dor. It fastened
with three slid steel blts thrown simultaneously with a single
handle, and had a time-lck. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its
wrkings t Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too
intelligent interest. The tw children, May and Agatha, were
delighted by the shining metal and funny clck and knbs.

While they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned n
his elbw, loking casually inside between the railings. He told the
teller that he didn't want anything; he was just waiting fr a man
he knew.

Suddenly there was a scream r tw from the women, and a commotion.
Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-ld girl, in a spirit
f play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then sht the bolts
and turned the knb f the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.

The ld banker sprang t the handle and tugged at it for a moment.
"The dr can't be opened," he groaned. "The clock hasn't been wound
nr the cmbination set."

Agatha's mther screamed again, hysterically.

"Hush!" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. "All be quite
fr a mment. Agatha!" he called as loudly as he could. "Listen to
me." During the fllwing silence they could just hear the faint
sund f the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of
terrr.

"My precius darling!" wailed the mther. "She will die of fright!
pen the dor! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?"

"There isn't a man nearer than Little Rck wh can open that door,"
said Mr. Adams, in a shaky vice. "My Gd! Spencer, what shall we
d? That child--she can't stand it lng in there. There isn't enough
air, and, besides, she'll g int convulsions from fright."

Agatha's mther, frantic nw, beat the door of the vault with her
hands. Smebdy wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy,
her large eyes full f anguish, but nt yet despairing. To a
wman nthing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she
wrships.

"Can't yu d something, Ralph--_try_, won't you?"

He lked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his
keen eyes.

"Annabel," he said, "give me that rse yu are wearing, will you?"

Hardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud
frm the bsom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy
stuffed it int his vest-pcket, threw off his coat and pulled up
his shirt-sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and
Jimmy Valentine tk his place.

"Get away frm the dor, all of you," he commanded, shortly.

He set his suit-case n the table, and pened it out flat. From that
time n he seemed t be unconscious of the presence of any one else.
He laid ut the shining, queer implements swiftly and rderly,
whistling sftly t himself as he always did when at work. In a deep
silence and immvable, the thers watched him as if under a spell.

In a minute Jimmy's pet drill was biting smthly into the steel
dr. In ten minutes--breaking his own burglarious record--he threw
back the blts and pened the door.

Agatha, almst cllapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother's
arms.

Jimmy Valentine put n his cat, and walked outside the railings
twards the frnt door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away
vice that he nce knew call "Ralph!" But he never hesitated.

At the dr a big man stood somewhat in his way.

"Hell, Ben!" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. "Gt around
at last, have yu? Well, let's g. I don't know that it makes much
difference, nw."

And then Ben Price acted rather strangely.

"Guess yu're mistaken, Mr. Spencer," he said. "Dn't believe I
recgnize yu. Your buggy's waiting for you, ain't it?"

And Ben Price turned and strlled dwn the street.

CHERCHEZ LA FEMME


Rbbins, reprter for the _Picayune_, and Dumars, of
_L'Abeille_--the ld French newspaper that has buzzed fr nearly a
century--were gd friends, well proven by years of ups and downs
tgether. They were seated where they had a habit f meeting--in the
little, Crele-haunted café f Madame Tibault, in Dumaine Street.
If yu knw the place, you will experience a thrill of pleasure in
recalling it t mind. It is small and dark, with six little plished
tables, at which yu may sit and drink the best cffee in New
rleans, and cncoctions of absinthe equal to Sazerac's best. Madame
Tibault, fat and indulgent, presides at the desk, and takes yur
mney. Niclette and Mémé, madame's nieces, in charming bib aprons,
bring the desirable beverages.

Dumars, with true Crele luxury, was sipping his absinthe, with
half-clsed eyes, in a swirl f cigarette smoke. Robbins was looking
ver the mrning _Pic._, detecting, as young reporters will, the
grss blunders in the make-up, and the envius blue-pencilling his
wn stuff had received. This item, in the advertising clumns,
caught his eye, and with an exclamatin f sudden interest he read
it alud t his friend.


   Public Auctin.--At three 'clock this afternoon there will
   be sld t the highest bidder all the common property of the
   Little Sisters f Samaria, at the hme of the Sisterhood,
   in Bnhmme Street. The sale will dispose of the building,
   grund, and the cmplete furnishings of the house and chapel,
   withut reserve.


This ntice stirred the tw friends to a reminiscent talk concerning
an episde in their jurnalistic career that had occurred about
tw years befre. They recalled the incidents, went over the old
theries, and discussed it anew frm the different perspective time
had brught.

There were n ther customers in the café. Madame's fine ear had
caught the line f their talk, and she came ver to their table--for
had it nt been her lst money--her vanished twenty thousand
dllars--that had set the whle matter going?

The three tk up the long-abandoned mystery, threshing over the
ld, dry chaff f it. It was in the chapel of this house of the
Little Sisters f Samaria that Rbbins and Dumars had stood during
that eager, fruitless news search f theirs, and loked upon the
gilded statue f the Virgin.

"Thass s, bys," said madame, summing up. "Thass ver' wicked man,
M'sieur Mrin. Everybdy shall be cert' he steal those money I
plaze in his hand fr keep safe. Yes. He's bun' spend that money,
smehw." Madame turned a broad and contemplative smile upon Dumars.
"I nd'stand yu, M'sieur Dumars, those day you come ask fo' tell
ev'ything I knw 'but M'sieur Morin. Ah! yes, I know most time
when thse men lse money you say '_Cherchez la femme_'--there is
smewhere the wman. But not for M'sieur Morin. No, boys. Before he
shall die, he is like ne saint. Yu might's well, M'sieur Dumars,
g try find thse money in those statue of Virgin Mary that M'sieur
Mrin present at thse _p'tite soeurs_, as try find one _femme_."

At Madame Tibault's last wrds, Rbbins started slightly and cast a
keen, sidelng glance at Dumars. The Crele sat, unmoved, dreamily
watching the spirals f his cigarette smke.

It was then nine 'clck in the morning and, a few minutes later,
the tw friends separated, ging different ways to their day's
duties. And nw fllows the brief story of Madame Tibault's vanished
thusands:



New rleans will readily recall t mind the circumstances attendant
upn the death f Mr. Gaspard Morin, in that city. Mr. Morin was an
artistic gldsmith and jeweller in the ld French Quarter, and a man
held in the highest esteem. He belnged t one of the oldest French
families, and was f sme distinction as an antiquary and historian.
He was a bachelr, abut fifty years of age. He lived in quiet
cmfrt, at one of those rare old hostelries in Royal Street. He was
fund in his roms, one morning, dead from unknown causes.

When his affairs came t be loked into, it was found that he was
practically inslvent, his stck of goods and personal property
barely--but nearly enugh t free him from censure--covering
his liabilities. Fllwing came the disclosure that he had been
entrusted with the sum f twenty thusand dollars by a former upper
servant in the Mrin family, ne Madame Tibault, which she had
received as a legacy frm relatives in France.

The mst searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authrities
failed t reveal the dispsition of the money. It had vanished, and
left n trace. Sme weeks before his death, Mr. Morin had drawn
the entire amunt, in gld coin, from the bank where it had been
placed while he lked about (he told Madame Tibault) for a safe
investment. Therefre, Mr. Mrin's memory seemed doomed to bear the
clud f dishonesty, while madame was, of course, disconsolate.

Then it was that Rbbins and Dumars, representing their respective
jurnals, began ne of those pertinacious private investigations
which, f late years, the press has adpted as a means to glory and
the satisfactin f public curiosity.

"_Cherchez la femme_," said Dumars.

"That's the ticket!" agreed Rbbins. "All rads lead to the eternal
feminine. We will find the wman."

They exhausted the knwledge f the staff of Mr. Morin's hotel, from
the bell-by dwn to the proprietor. They gently, but inflexibly,
pumped the family f the deceased as far as his cusins twice
remved. They artfully sunded the employees of the late jeweller,
and dgged his custmers for information concerning his habits. Like
bldhounds they traced every step of the supposed defaulter, as
nearly as might be, fr years alng the limited and monotonous paths
he had trdden.

At the end f their laburs, Mr. Morin stood, an immaculate man.
Nt ne weakness that might be served up as a criminal tendency,
nt ne deviation from the path of rectitude, not even a hint of a
predilectin fr the opposite sex, was found to be placed in his
debit. His life had been as regular and austere as a mnk's; his
habits, simple and uncncealed. Generus, charitable, and a model in
prpriety, was the verdict f all who knew him.

"What, nw?" asked Rbbins, fingering his empty notebook.

"_Cherchez la femme_," said Dumars, lighting a cigarette. "Try Lady
Bellairs."

This piece f femininity was the race-track favurite of the season.
Being feminine, she was erratic in her gaits, and there were a few
heavy lsers abut town who had believed she could be true. The
reprters applied fr information.

Mr. Mrin? Certainly nt. He was never even a spectator at the
races. Nt that kind f a man. Surprised the gentlemen should ask.

"Shall we thrw it up?" suggested Rbbins, "and let the puzzle
department have a try?"

"_Cherchez la femme_," hummed Dumars, reaching fr a match. "Try the
Little Sisters f What-d'-yu-call-'em."

It had develped, during the investigatin, that Mr. Morin had held
this benevlent rder in particular favour. He had contributed
liberally tward its supprt and had chosen its chapel as his
favurite place f private worship. It was said that he went there
daily t make his devtions at the altar. Indeed, toward the last of
his life his whle mind seemed t have fixed itself upon religious
matters, perhaps t the detriment f his worldly affairs.

Thither went Rbbins and Dumars, and were admitted thrugh the
narrw dorway in the blank stone wall that frowned upon Bonhomme
Street. An ld wman was sweeping the chapel. She told them that
Sister Félicité, the head f the rder, was then at prayer at the
altar in the alcve. In a few mments she would emerge. Heavy, black
curtains screened the alcve. They waited.

Sn the curtains were disturbed, and Sister Félicité came forth.
She was tall, tragic, bny, and plain-featured, dressed in the black
gwn and severe bnnet of the sisterhood.

Rbbins, a god rough-and-tumble reporter, but lacking the delicate
tuch, began t speak.

They represented the press. The lady had, n dubt, heard of the
Mrin affair. It was necessary, in justice t that gentleman's
memry, t probe the mystery of the lost money. It was known that he
had cme ften to this chapel. Any information, now, concerning Mr.
Mrin's habits, tastes, the friends he had, and s on, would be of
value in ding him psthumous justice.

Sister Félicité had heard. Whatever she knew wuld be willingly
tld, but it was very little. Mnsieur Morin had been a good friend
t the rder, sometimes contributing as much as a hundred dollars.
The sisterhd was an independent one, depending entirely upon
private cntributins for the means to carry on its charitable work.
Mr. Mrin had presented the chapel with silver candlesticks and an
altar clth. He came every day t worship in the chapel, sometimes
remaining fr an hur. He was a devout Catholic, consecrated to
hliness. Yes, and als in the alcove was a statue of the Virgin
that he had himself mdeled, cast, and presented t the order. Oh,
it was cruel t cast a dubt upon so good a man!

Rbbins was als profoundly grieved at the imputation. But, until it
was fund what Mr. Mrin had done with Madame Tibault's money, he
feared the tngue f slander would not be stilled. Sometimes--in
fact, very ften--in affairs f the kind there was--er--as the
saying ges--er--a lady in the case. In abslute confidence,
nw--if--perhaps--

Sister Félicité's large eyes regarded him slemnly.

"There was ne wman," she said, slowly, "to whom he bowed--to whom
he gave his heart."

Rbbins fumbled rapturusly for his pencil.

"Behld the wman!" said Sister Félicité, suddenly, in deep tones.

She reached a lng arm and swept aside the curtain f the alcove.
In there was a shrine, lit t a glw of soft colour by the light
puring thrugh a stained-glass window. Within a deep niche in the
bare stne wall stod an image of the Virgin Mary, the colour of
pure gld.

Dumars, a cnventinal Catholic, succumbed to the dramatic in the
act. He bwed his head fr an instant and made the sign of the
crss. The smewhat abashed Robbins, murmuring an indistinct
aplgy, backed awkwardly away. Sister Félicité drew back the
curtain, and the reprters departed.

n the narrw stone sidewalk of Bonhomme Street, Robbins turned to
Dumars, with unwrthy sarcasm.

"Well, what next? Churchy law fem?"

"Absinthe," said Dumars.



With the histry f the missing money thus partially related, some
cnjecture may be frmed of the sudden idea that Madame Tibault's
wrds seemed t have suggested to Robbins's brain.

Was it s wild a surmise--that the religius fanatic had offered up
his wealth--r, rather, Madame Tibault's--in the shape f a material
symbl f his consuming devotion? Stranger things have been done in
the name f wrship. Was it not possible that the lost thousands
were mlded int that lustrous image? That the goldsmith had formed
it f the pure and precius metal, and set it there, through some
hpe f a perhaps disordered brain to propitiate the saints and pave
the way t his wn selfish glory?

That afternn, at five minutes to three, Robbins entered the chapel
dr of the Little Sisters of Samaria. He saw, in the dim light,
a crwd f perhaps a hundred people gathered to attend the sale.
Mst f them were members of various religious orders, priests and
churchmen, cme t purchase the paraphernalia of the chapel, lest
they fall int desecrating hands. thers were business men and
agents cme t bid upon the realty. A clerical-looking brother
had vlunteered t wield the hammer, bringing to the office of
auctineer the anmaly of choice diction and dignity of manner.

A few f the minr articles were sold, and then two assistants
brught frward the image of the Virgin.

Rbbins started the bidding at ten dllars. A stout man, in an
ecclesiastical garb, went t fifteen. A vice from another part of
the crwd raised t twenty. The three bid alternately, raising by
bids f five, until the ffer was fifty dollars. Then the stout man
drpped ut, and Robbins, as a sort of _coup de main_, went to a
hundred.

"ne hundred and fifty," said the ther voice.

"Tw hundred," bid Rbbins, boldly.

"Tw-fifty," called his cmpetitor, promptly.

The reprter hesitated fr the space of a lightning flash,
estimating hw much he culd borrow from the boys in the office,
and screw frm the business manager frm his next month's salary.

"Three hundred," he ffered.

"Three-fifty," spke up the ther, in a louder voice--a voice that
sent Rbbins diving suddenly thrugh the crowd in its direction, to
catch Dumars, its wner, ferciously by the collar.

"Yu uncnverted idiot!" hissed Robbins, close to his ear--"pool!"

"Agreed!" said Dumars, clly. "I couldn't raise three hundred and
fifty dllars with a search-warrant, but I can stand half. What yu
cme bidding against me fr?"

"I thught I was the nly fool in the crowd," explained Robbins.

N ne else bidding, the statue was knocked down to the syndicate
at their last ffer. Dumars remained with the prize, while Rbbins
hurried frth t wring from the resources and credit of both the
price. He sn returned with the money, and the two musketeers
laded their precius package into a carriage and drove with it
t Dumars's rom, in old Chartres Street, nearby. They lugged it,
cvered with a clth, up the stairs, and deposited it on a table.
A hundred punds it weighed, if an unce, and at that estimate,
accrding t their calculation, if their daring theory were correct,
it std there, worth twenty thousand golden dollars.

Rbbins remved the covering, and opened his pocket-knife.

"_Sacré!_" muttered Dumars, shuddering. "It is the Mther f Christ.
What wuld yu do?"

"Shut up, Judas!" said Rbbins, cldly. "It's too late for you to be
saved nw."

With a firm hand, he chipped a slice frm the shulder of the image.
The cut shwed a dull, grayish metal, with a thin cating of gold
leaf.

"Lead!" annunced Rbbins, hurling his knife to the floor--"gilded!"

"T the devil with it!" said Dumars, frgetting his scruples. "I
must have a drink."

Tgether they walked modily to the café of Madame Tribault, two
squares away.

It seemed that madame's mind had been stirred that day t fresh
recllectins of the past services of the two young men in her
behalf.

"Yu mustn't sit by thse table," she interposed, as they were about
t drp into their accustomed seats. "Thass so, boys. But no. I mek
yu cme at this room, like my _trés bon amis_. Yes. I goin' mek for
yu myself ne _anisette_ and one _café royale_ ver' fine. Ah! I lak
treat my fren' nize. Yes. Plis cme in this way."

Madame led them int the little back rom, into which she sometimes
invited the especially favured f her customers. In two comfortable
armchairs, by a big windw that pened upon the courtyard, she
placed them, with a lw table between. Bustling hspitably about,
she began t prepare the prmised refreshments.

It was the first time the reprters had been hnoured with admission
t the sacred precincts. The rom was in dusky twilight, flecked
with gleams f the plished, fine woods and burnished glass and
metal that the Creles lve. From the little courtyard a tiny
funtain sent in an insinuating sund of trickling waters, to which
a banana plant by the windw kept time with its tremulus leaves.

Rbbins, an investigatr by nature, sent a curious glance roving
abut the rom. From some barbaric ancestor, madame had inherited a
_penchant_ fr the crude in decration.

The walls were adrned with cheap lithgraphs--florid libels upon
nature, addressed t the taste f the _bourgeoisie_--birthday cards,
garish newspaper supplements, and specimens f art-advertising
calculated t reduce the ptic nerve to stunned submission. A patch
f smething unintelligible in the midst of the more candid display
puzzled Rbbins, and he rse and took a step nearer, to interrogate
it at clser range. Then he leaned weakly against the wall, and
called ut:

"Madame Tibault! h, madame! Since when--h! since when have you
been in the habit f papering yur walls with five thousand dollar
United States fur per cent. gld bonds? Tell me--is this a Grimm's
fairy tale, r shuld I consult an oculist?"

At his wrds, Madame Tibault and Dumars apprached.

"H'what yu say?" said madame, cheerily. "H'what yu say, M'sieur
Rbbin? _Bn!_ Ah! those nize li'l peezes papier! One tam I think
thse w'at yu call calendair, wiz ze li'l day of mont' below. But,
n. Thse wall is broke in those plaze, M'sieur Robbin', and I
plaze thse li'l peezes papier t conceal ze crack. I did think the
culeur harm'nize s well with the wall papier. Where I get them
frm? Ah, yes, I remem' ver' well. ne day M'sieur Morin, he come
at my huze--thass 'but one mont' before he shall die--thass 'long
'but tam he prmise fo' inves' those money fo' me. M'sieur Morin,
he leave thze li'l peezes papier in thse table, and say ver' much
'but mney thass hard for me to ond'stan. _Mais_ I never see those
mney again. Thass ver' wicked man, M'sieur Mrin. H'what you call
thse peezes papier, M'sieur Rbbin'--_bon!_"

Rbbins explained.

"There's yur twenty thusand dollars, with coupons attached," he
said, running his thumb arund the edge f the four bonds. "Better
get an expert t peel them ff for you. Mister Morin was all right.
I'm ging ut to get my ears trimmed."

He dragged Dumars by the arm int the uter room. Madame was
screaming fr Niclette and Mémé to come and observe the fortune
returned t her by M'sieur Mrin, that best of men, that saint in
glry.

"Marsy," said Rbbins, "I'm ging on a jamboree. For three days the
esteemed _Pic._ will have t get alng without my valuable services.
I advise yu t join me. Now, that green stuff you drink is no good.
It stimulates thught. What we want t do is to forget to remember.
I'll intrduce yu to the only lady in this case that is guaranteed
t prduce the desired results. Her name is Belle of Kentucky,
twelve-year-ld Burbon. In quarts. How does the idea strike you?"

"_Allns!_" said Dumars. "_Cherchez la femme_."

FRIENDS IN SAN RSARI


The west-bund train stpped at San Rosario on time at 8.20 A.M. A
man with a thick black-leather wallet under his arm left the train
and walked rapidly up the main street f the twn. There were other
passengers wh als got off at San Rosario, but they either slouched
limberly ver t the railroad eating-house or the Silver Dollar
saln, or joined the groups of idlers about the station.

Indecisin had n part in the movements of the man with the wallet.
He was shrt in stature, but strngly built, with very light,
clsely-trimmed hair, smoth, determined face, and aggressive,
gld-rimmed nse glasses. He was well dressed in the prevailing
Eastern style. His air dented a quiet but cnscious reserve force,
if nt actual authrity.

After walking a distance f three squares he came t the centre of
the twn's business area. Here anther street of importance crossed
the main ne, frming the hub of San Rosario's life and commerce.
Upn ne corner stood the post-office. Upon another Rubensky's
Clthing Emprium. The other two diagonally opposing corners were
ccupied by the twn's two banks, the First National and the
Stckmen's Natinal. Into the First National Bank of San Rosario
the newcmer walked, never slwing his brisk step until he stood
at the cashier's windw. The bank pened for business at nine, and
the wrking frce was already assembled, each member preparing his
department fr the day's business. The cashier was examining the
mail when he nticed the stranger standing at his windw.

"Bank desn't pen 'til nine," he remarked curtly, but without
feeling. He had had t make that statement s often to early birds
since San Rsari adopted city banking hours.

"I am well aware f that," said the ther man, in cool, brittle
tnes. "Will yu kindly receive my card?"

The cashier drew the small, sptless parallelgram inside the bars
f his wicket, and read:


   J. F. C. Nettlewick
   Natinal Bank Examiner


"h--er--will yu walk around inside, Mr.--er--Nettlewick. Your
first visit--didn't knw yur business, of course. Walk right
arund, please."

The examiner was quickly inside the sacred precincts f the bank,
where he was pnderusly introduced to each employee in turn by Mr.
Edlinger, the cashier--a middle-aged gentleman f deliberatin,
discretin, and methd.

"I was kind f expecting Sam Turner rund again, pretty soon," said
Mr. Edlinger. "Sam's been examining us nw, fr about four years. I
guess yu'll find us all right, thugh, considering the tightness
in business. Nt verly much money on hand, but able to stand the
strms, sir, stand the strms."

"Mr. Turner and I have been rdered by the Cmptroller to exchange
districts," said the examiner, in his decisive, frmal tnes. "He is
cvering my ld territory in Southern Illinois and Indiana. I will
take the cash first, please."

Perry Drsey, the teller, was already arranging his cash n the
cunter fr the examiner's inspection. He knew it was right to a
cent, and he had nthing t fear, but he was nervous and flustered.
S was every man in the bank. There was smething so icy and swift,
s impersnal and uncompromising about this man that his very
presence seemed an accusatin. He loked to be a man who would never
make nr verlook an error.

Mr. Nettlewick first seized the currency, and with a rapid, almst
juggling mtin, counted it by packages. Then he spun the sponge cup
tward him and verified the cunt by bills. His thin, white fingers
flew like sme expert musician's upn the keys of a piano. He dumped
the gld upn the counter with a crash, and the coins whined and
sang as they skimmed acrss the marble slab frm the tips of his
nimble digits. The air was full f fractinal currency when he came
t the halves and quarters. He cunted the last nickle and dime.
He had the scales brught, and he weighed every sack f silver
in the vault. He questined Drsey concerning each of the cash
memranda--certain checks, charge slips, etc., carried ver from the
previus day's wrk--with unimpeachable courtesy, yet with something
s mysteriusly momentous in his frigid manner, that the teller was
reduced t pink cheeks and a stammering tngue.

This newly-imprted examiner was s different from Sam Turner. It
had been Sam's way t enter the bank with a shut, pass the cigars,
and tell the latest stries he had picked up n his rounds. His
custmary greeting t Dorsey had been, "Hello, Perry! Haven't
skipped ut with the bodle yet, I see." Turner's way of counting
the cash had been different, t. He would finger the packages of
bills in a tired kind f way, and then g into the vault and kick
ver a few sacks f silver, and the thing was done. Halves and
quarters and dimes? Nt fr Sam Turner. "No chicken feed for
me," he wuld say when they were set befre him. "I'm not in the
agricultural department." But, then, Turner was a Texan, an ld
friend f the bank's president, and had knwn Dorsey since he was
a baby.

While the examiner was cunting the cash, Majr Thomas B.
Kingman--knwn t every one as "Major Tom"--the president of the
First Natinal, drve up to the side door with his old dun horse and
buggy, and came inside. He saw the examiner busy with the mney,
and, ging int the little "pony corral," as he called it, in which
his desk was railed ff, he began t look over his letters.

Earlier, a little incident had ccurred that even the sharp eyes f
the examiner had failed t ntice. When he had begun his work at the
cash cunter, Mr. Edlinger had winked significantly at Ry Wilson,
the yuthful bank messenger, and ndded his head slightly toward the
frnt dor. Roy understood, got his hat, and walked leisurely out,
with his cllectr's book under his arm. Once outside, he made a
bee-line fr the Stckmen's National. That bank was also getting
ready t pen. No customers had, as yet, presented themselves.

"Say, yu peple!" cried Roy, with the familiarity of youth and long
acquaintance, "yu want t get a move on you. There's a new bank
examiner ver at the First, and he's a stem-winder. He's cunting
nickles n Perry, and he's gt the whole outfit bluffed. Mr.
Edlinger gave me the tip t let yu know."

Mr. Buckley, president f the Stckmen's National--a stout, elderly
man, lking like a farmer dressed for Sunday--heard Roy from his
private ffice at the rear and called him.

"Has Majr Kingman cme down to the bank yet?" he asked of the boy.

"Yes, sir, he was just driving up as I left," said Ry.

"I want yu t take him a note. Put it into his own hands as soon as
yu get back."

Mr. Buckley sat dwn and began t write.

Ry returned and handed t Major Kingman the envelope containing the
nte. The majr read it, folded it, and slipped it into his vest
pcket. He leaned back in his chair fr a few moments as if he were
meditating deeply, and then rse and went int the vault. He came
ut with the bulky, ld-fashioned leather note case stamped on the
back in gilt letters, "Bills Discunted." In this were the ntes due
the bank with their attached securities, and the majr, in his rugh
way, dumped the lt upn his desk and began to sort them over.

By this time Nettlewick had finished his cunt f the cash. His
pencil fluttered like a swallw ver the sheet of paper on which he
had set his figures. He pened his black wallet, which seemed t be
als a kind f secret memorandum book, made a few rapid figures in
it, wheeled and transfixed Drsey with the glare f his spectacles.
That lk seemed to say: "You're safe this time, but--"

"Cash all crrect," snapped the examiner. He made a dash fr the
individual bkkeeper, and, for a few minutes there was a fluttering
f ledger leaves and a sailing f balance sheets through the air.

"Hw ften do you balance your pass-books?" he demanded, suddenly.

"Er--nce a mnth," faltered the individual bookkeeper, wondering
hw many years they wuld give him.

"All right," said the examiner, turning and charging upn the
general bkkeeper, who had the statements of his foreign banks and
their recncilement memranda ready. Everything there was found to
be all right. Then the stub bk of the certificates of deposit.
Flutter--flutter--zip--zip--check! All right. List f ver-drafts,
please. Thanks. H'm-m. Unsigned bills f the bank, next. All right.

Then came the cashier's turn, and easy-ging Mr. Edlinger rubbed his
nse and plished his glasses nervously under the quick fire of
questins cncerning the circulation, undivided profits, bank real
estate, and stck wnership.

Presently Nettlewick was aware f a big man twering above him at
his elbw--a man sixty years f age, rugged and hale, with a rough,
grizzled beard, a mass f gray hair, and a pair f penetrating blue
eyes that cnfrnted the formidable glasses of the examiner without
a flicker.

"Er--Majr Kingman, ur president--er--Mr. Nettlewick," said the
cashier.

Tw men f very different types shook hands. One was a finished
prduct f the world of straight lines, conventional methods, and
frmal affairs. The ther was something freer, wider, and nearer to
nature. Tm Kingman had nt been cut to any pattern. He had been
mule-driver, cwby, ranger, soldier, sheriff, prospector, and
cattleman. Nw, when he was bank president, his ld comrades from
the prairies, f the saddle, tent, and trail fund no change in him.
He had made his frtune when Texas cattle were at the high tide f
value, and had rganized the First Natinal Bank of San Rosario.
In spite f his largeness f heart and sometimes unwise generosity
tward his ld friends, the bank had prospered, for Major Tom
Kingman knew men as well as he knew cattle. f late years the cattle
business had knwn a depressin, and the major's bank was one of the
few whse lsses had not been great.

"And nw," said the examiner, briskly, pulling ut his watch, "the
last thing is the lans. We will take them up nw, if you please."

He had gne thrugh the First National at almost record-breaking
speed--but thrughly, as he did everything. The running order of
the bank was smth and clean, and that had facilitated his work.
There was but ne ther bank in the town. He received from the
Gvernment a fee f twenty-five dollars for each bank that he
examined. He shuld be able t go over those loans and discounts in
half an hur. If s, he could examine the other bank immediately
afterward, and catch the 11.45, the nly ther train that day in
the directin he was wrking. Otherwise, he would have to spend the
night and Sunday in this uninteresting Western twn. That was why
Mr. Nettlewick was rushing matters.

"Cme with me, sir," said Majr Kingman, in his deep voice, that
united the Suthern drawl with the rhythmic twang f the West; "We
will g ver them together. Nobody in the bank knows those notes as
I d. Sme of 'em are a little wobbly on their legs, and some are
mavericks withut extra many brands n their backs, but they'll most
all pay ut at the rund-up."

The tw sat dwn at the president's desk. First, the examiner went
thrugh the ntes at lightning speed, and added up their total,
finding it t agree with the amunt of loans carried on the book
f daily balances. Next, he tok up the larger loans, inquiring
scrupulusly int the condition of their endorsers or securities.
The new examiner's mind seemed t curse and turn and make
unexpected dashes hither and thither like a bldhound seeking a
trail. Finally he pushed aside all the ntes except a few, which he
arranged in a neat pile befre him, and began a dry, frmal little
speech.

"I find, sir, the cnditin of your bank to be very good,
cnsidering the por crops and the depression in the cattle
interests f yur state. The clerical work seems to be done
accurately and punctually. Yur past-due paper is mderate in
amunt, and prmises only a small loss. I would recommend the
calling in f yur large loans, and the making of only sixty and
ninety day r call lans until general business revives. And now,
there is ne thing mre, and I will have finished with the bank.
Here are six ntes aggregating smething like $40,000. They are
secured, accrding t their faces, by various stocks, bonds, shares,
etc. t the value f $70,000. Those securities are missing from the
ntes t which they should be attached. I suppose you have them in
the safe r vault. Yu will permit me to examine them."

Majr Tm's light-blue eyes turned unflinchingly toward the
examiner.

"N, sir," he said, in a lw but steady tone; "those securities are
neither in the safe nr in the vault. I have taken them. Yu may
hld me persnally responsible for their absence."

Nettlewick felt a slight thrill. He had nt expected this. He had
struck a mmentus trail when the hunt was drawing to a close.

"Ah!" said the examiner. He waited a mment, and then cntinued:
"May I ask yu t explain more definitely?"

"The securities were taken by me," repeated the majr. "It was nt
fr my wn use, but to save an old friend in trouble. Come in here,
sir, and we'll talk it ver."

He led the examiner int the bank's private ffice at the rear, and
clsed the dor. There was a desk, and a table, and half-a-dozen
leather-cvered chairs. n the wall was the mounted head of a Texas
steer with hrns five feet frm tip to tip. Opposite hung the
majr's ld cavalry saber that he had carried at Shiloh and Fort
Pillw.

Placing a chair fr Nettlewick, the majr seated himself by the
windw, frm which he could see the post-office and the carved
limestne frnt of the Stockmen's National. He did not speak at
nce, and Nettlewick felt, perhaps, that the ice culd be broken
by smething s near its own temperature as the voice of official
warning.

"Yur statement," he began, "since yu have failed to modify it,
amunts, as yu must know, to a very serious thing. You are aware,
als, f what my duty must compel me to do. I shall have to go
befre the United States Cmmissioner and make--"

"I knw, I knw," said Major Tom, with a wave of his hand. "You
dn't suppse I'd run a bank without being posted on national
banking laws and the revised statutes! D yur duty. I'm not asking
any favurs. But, I spke of my friend. I did want you to hear me
tell yu abut Bob."

Nettlewick settled himself in his chair. There wuld be n leaving
San Rsari for him that day. He would have to telegraph to the
Cmptrller of the Currency; he would have to swear out a warrant
befre the United States Cmmissioner for the arrest of Major
Kingman; perhaps he wuld be rdered to close the bank on account of
the lss f the securities. It was not the first crime the examiner
had unearthed. nce r twice the terrible upheaval of human emotions
that his investigatins had losed had almost caused a ripple in his
fficial calm. He had seen bank men kneel and plead and cry like
wmen fr a chance--an hour's time--the overlooking of a single
errr. ne cashier had shot himself at his desk before him. None of
them had taken it with the dignity and clness of this stern old
Westerner. Nettlewick felt that he wed it t him at least to listen
if he wished t talk. With his elbw on the arm of his chair, and
his square chin resting upn the fingers f his right hand, the bank
examiner waited t hear the cnfession of the president of the First
Natinal Bank f San Rosario.

"When a man's yur friend," began Majr Tom, somewhat didactically,
"fr frty years, and tried by water, fire, earth, and cyclones,
when yu can d him a little favour you feel like doing it."

("Embezzle fr him $70,000 wrth of securities," thought the
examiner.)

"We were cwbys together, Bob and I," continued the major, speaking
slwly, and deliberately, and musingly, as if his thughts were
rather with the past than the critical present, "and we prspected
tgether fr gold and silver over Arizona, New Mexico, and a good
part f Califrnia. We were both in the war of 'sixty-one, but in
different cmmands. We've fught Indians and horse thieves side by
side; we've starved fr weeks in a cabin in the Arizna mountains,
buried twenty feet deep in snw; we've ridden herd tgether when the
wind blew s hard the lightning culdn't strike--well, Bob and I
have been thrugh sme rough spells since the first time we met in
the branding camp f the ld Anchor-Bar ranch. And during that time
we've fund it necessary mre than once to help each other out of
tight places. In thse days it was expected f a man to stick to his
friend, and he didn't ask any credit fr it. Prbably next day you'd
need him t get at yur back and help stand off a band of Apaches,
r put a turniquet on your leg above a rattlesnake bite and ride
fr whisky. S, after all, it was give and take, and if you didn't
stand square with yur pardner, why, yu might be shy one when you
needed him. But Bb was a man wh was willing to go further than
that. He never played a limit.

"Twenty years ag I was sheriff f this county, and I made Bob my
chief deputy. That was befre the bom in cattle when we both made
ur stake. I was sheriff and cllector, and it was a big thing for
me then. I was married, and we had a by and a girl--a fur and a
six year ld. There was a cmfortable house next to the courthouse,
furnished by the cunty, rent free, and I was saving sme money. Bob
did mst f the office work. Both of us had seen rough times and
plenty f rustling and danger, and I tell yu it was great to hear
the rain and the sleet dashing against the windws f nights, and
be warm and safe and cmfrtable, and know you could get up in the
mrning and be shaved and have flks call you 'mister.' And then, I
had the finest wife and kids that ever struck the range, and my ld
friend with me enjying the first fruits f prosperity and white
shirts, and I guess I was happy. Yes, I was happy abut that time."

The majr sighed and glanced casually ut of the window. The bank
examiner changed his psitin, and leaned his chin upon his other
hand.

"ne winter," cntinued the major, "the money for the county taxes
came puring in s fast that I didn't have time to take the stuff to
the bank fr a week. I just shved the checks into a cigar box and
the mney int a sack, and locked them in the big safe that belonged
t the sheriff's ffice.

"I had been verwrked that week, and was about sick, anyway. My
nerves were ut f order, and my sleep at night didn't seem to rest
me. The dctr had some scientific name for it, and I was taking
medicine. And s, added t the rest, I went to bed at night with
that mney n my mind. Not that there was much need of being
wrried, fr the safe was a good one, and nobody but Bob and I knew
the cmbinatin. On Friday night there was about $6,500 in cash in
the bag. n Saturday mrning I went to the office as usual. The safe
was lcked, and Bb was writing at his desk. I opened the safe,
and the mney was gne. I called Bob, and roused everybody in the
curt-huse to announce the robbery. It struck me that Bob took it
pretty quiet, cnsidering hw much it reflected upon both him and
me.

"Tw days went by and we never gt a clew. It couldn't have been
burglars, fr the safe had been pened by the combination in the
prper way. Peple must have begun to talk, for one afternoon in
cmes Alice--that's my wife--and the by and girl, and Alice
stamps her ft, and her eyes flash, and she cries out, 'The lying
wretches--Tm, Tm!' and I catch her in a faint, and bring her
'rund little by little, and she lays her head dwn and cries and
cries fr the first time since she tok Tom Kingman's name and
frtunes. And Jack and Zilla--the yungsters--they were always wild
as tiger cubs t rush at Bb and climb all over him whenever they
were allwed t come to the court-house--they stood and kicked their
little shes, and herded tgether like scared partridges. They were
having their first trip dwn int the shadows of life. Bob was
wrking at his desk, and he gt up and went out without a word. The
grand jury was in sessin then, and the next mrning Bob went before
them and cnfessed that he stle the money. He said he lost it in a
pker game. In fifteen minutes they had fund a true bill and sent
me the warrant t arrest the man with whm I'd been closer than a
thusand brthers for many a year.

"I did it, and then I said t Bb, pointing: 'There's my house,
and here's my ffice, and up there's Maine, and ut that way is
Califrnia, and ver there is Florida--and that's your range 'til
curt meets. Yu're in my charge, and I take the responsibility.
Yu be here when yu're wanted.'

"'Thanks, Tm,' he said, kind f carelessly; 'I was sort of hoping
yu wuldn't lock me up. Court meets next Monday, so, if you don't
bject, I'll just laf around the office until then. I've got one
favur t ask, if it isn't too much. If you'd let the kids come out
in the yard nce in a while and have a rmp I'd like it.'

"'Why nt?' I answered him. 'They're welcme, and so are you. And
cme t my house, the same as ever.' You see, Mr. Nettlewick, you
can't make a friend f a thief, but neither can yu make a thief of
a friend, all at nce."

The examiner made n answer. At that mment was heard the shrill
whistle f a lcomotive pulling into the depot. That was the train
n the little, narrw-gauge road that struck into San Rosario from
the suth. The majr cocked his ear and listened for a moment, and
lked at his watch. The narrow-gauge was in on time--10.35. The
majr cntinued:

"S Bb hung around the office, reading the papers and smoking. I
put anther deputy t work in his place, and after a while, the
first excitement f the case wre off.

"ne day when we were alne in the office Bob came over to where I
was sitting. He was lking sort of grim and blue--the same look
he used t get when he'd been up watching fr Indians all night or
herd-riding.

"'Tm,' says he, 'it's harder than standing ff redskins; it's
harder than lying in the lava desert frty miles frm water; but I'm
ging t stick it out to the end. You know that's been my style. But
if yu'd tip me the smallest kind f a sign--if you'd just say, "Bob
I understand," why, it wuld make it lts easier.'

"I was surprised. 'I dn't knw what you mean, Bob,' I said. 'Of
curse, yu know that I'd do anything under the sun to help you that
I culd. But yu've got me guessing.'

"'All right, Tm,' was all he said, and he went back t his
newspaper and lit anther cigar.

"It was the night befre curt met when I found out what he meant.
I went t bed that night with that same ld, light-headed, nervous
feeling cme back upn me. I dropped off to sleep about midnight.
When I awke I was standing half dressed in ne of the court-house
crridrs. Bob was holding one of my arms, our family doctor the
ther, and Alice was shaking me and half crying. She had sent fr
the dctr without my knowing it, and when he came they had found me
ut f bed and missing, and had begun a search.

"'Sleep-walking,' said the dctr.

"All f us went back t the house, and the doctor told us some
remarkable stries abut the strange things people had done while in
that cnditin. I was feeling rather chilly after my trip out, and,
as my wife was ut f the room at the time, I pulled open the door
f an ld wardrobe that stood in the room and dragged out a big
quilt I had seen in there. With it tumbled ut the bag f money for
stealing which Bb was t be tried--and convicted--in the morning.

"'Hw the jumping rattlesnakes did that get there?' I yelled, and
all hands must have seen hw surprised I was. Bb knew in a flash.

"'Yu darned ld snoozer,' he said, with the old-time look on his
face, 'I saw yu put it there. I watched yu open the safe and take
it ut, and I fllowed you. I looked through the window and saw you
hide it in that wardrbe.'

"'Then, yu blankety-blank, flp-eared, sheep-headed coyote, what
did yu say yu took it, for?'

"'Because,' said Bb, simply, 'I didn't knw you were asleep.'

"I saw him glance tward the dor of the room where Jack and Zilla
were, and I knew then what it meant t be a man's friend frm Bob's
pint f view."

Majr Tm paused, and again directed his glance out of the window.
He saw sme ne in the Stockmen's National Bank reach and draw a
yellw shade dwn the whole length of its plate-glass, big front
windw, althugh the position of the sun did not seem to warrant
such a defensive mvement against its rays.

Nettlewick sat up straight in his chair. He had listened patiently,
but withut cnsuming interest, to the major's story. It had
impressed him as irrelevant t the situatin, and it could certainly
have n effect upn the consequences. Those Western people,
he thught, had an exaggerated sentimentality. They were nt
business-like. They needed t be prtected from their friends.
Evidently the majr had cncluded. And what he had said amounted to
nthing.

"May I ask," said the examiner, "if yu have anything further t say
that bears directly upn the questin of those abstracted
securities?"

"Abstracted securities, sir!" Majr Tm turned suddenly in his
chair, his blue eyes flashing upn the examiner. "What d you mean,
sir?"

He drew frm his cat pocket a batch of folded papers held together
by a rubber band, tssed them int Nettlewick's hands, and rose to
his feet.

"Yu'll find thse securities there, sir, every stock, bond, and
share f 'em. I tok them from the notes while you were counting the
cash. Examine and cmpare them fr yourself."

The majr led the way back int the banking room. The examiner,
astunded, perplexed, nettled, at sea, fllowed. He felt that he had
been made the victim f smething that was not exactly a hoax, but
that left him in the shes f one who had been played upon, used,
and then discarded, withut even an inkling f the game. Perhaps,
als, his fficial position had been irreverently juggled with. But
there was nthing he culd take hold of. An official report of the
matter wuld be an absurdity. And, smehow, he felt that he would
never knw anything mre about the matter than he did then.

Frigidly, mechanically, Nettlewick examined the securities, fund
them t tally with the ntes, gathered his black wallet, and rose to
depart.

"I will say," he prtested, turning the indignant glare f his
glasses upn Majr Kingman, "that your statements--your misleading
statements, which yu have nt condescended to explain--do not
appear t be quite the thing, regarded either as business r humour.
I d nt understand such motives or actions."

Majr Tm looked down at him serenely and not unkindly.

"Sn," he said, "there are plenty f things in the chaparral, and
n the prairies, and up the canyns that you don't understand. But
I want t thank yu for listening to a garrulous old man's prosy
stry. We ld Texans love to talk about our adventures and our old
cmrades, and the hme folks have long ago learned to run when we
begin with 'nce upn a time,' so we have to spin our yarns to the
stranger within ur gates."

The majr smiled, but the examiner nly bowed coldly, and abruptly
quitted the bank. They saw him travel diagnally acrss the street
in a straight line and enter the Stckmen's Natinal Bank.

Majr Tm sat down at his desk, and drew from his vest pocket the
nte Ry had given him. He had read it once, but hurriedly, and now,
with smething like a twinkle in his eyes, he read it again. These
were the wrds he read:


   DEAR TM:

   I hear there's ne f Uncle Sam's grayhounds going through
   yu, and that means that we'll catch him inside f a couple
   f hurs, maybe. Now, I want you to do something for me.
   We've gt just $2,200 in the bank, and the law requires
   that we have $20,000. I let Rss and Fisher have $18,000
   late yesterday afternn to buy up that Gibson bunch of
   cattle. They'll realise $40,000 in less than thirty days n
   the transactin, but that wn't make my cash on hand look
   any prettier t that bank examiner. Nw, I can't show him
   thse ntes, for they're just plain notes of hand without
   any security in sight, but yu knw very well that Pink
   Rss and Jim Fisher are tw of the finest white men God
   ever made, and they'll d the square thing. Yu remember
   Jim Fisher--he was the ne wh shot that faro dealer in El
   Pas. I wired Sam Bradshaw's bank t send me $20,000, and
   it will get in n the narrw-gauge at 10.35. You can't let
   a bank examiner in t cunt $2,200 and close your doors.
   Tm, yu hold that examiner. Hold him. Hold him if you have
   t rpe him and sit on his head. Watch our front window
   after the narrw-gauge gets in, and when we've gt the cash
   inside we'll pull dwn the shade fr a signal. Don't turn
   him lse till then. I'm counting on you, Tom.

   Yur ld Pard,
   BB BUCKLY,
   _Prest. Stckmen's Natinal_.


The majr began t tear the note into small pieces and throw them
int his waste basket. He gave a satisfied little chuckle as he did
s.

"Cnfunded old reckless cowpuncher!" he growled, contentedly, "that
pays him sme n account for what he tried to do for me in the
sheriff's ffice twenty years ag."




XIII

THE FURTH IN SALVADR


n a summer's day, while the city was rcking with the din and red
uprar f patriotism, Billy Casparis told me this story.

In his way, Billy is Ulysses, Jr. Like Satan, he cmes frm going
t and fr upon the earth and walking up and down in it. To-morrow
mrning while yu are cracking your breakfast egg he may be off with
his little alligatr grip t boom a town site in the middle of Lake
keechbee or to trade horses with the Patagonians.

We sat at a little, rund table, and between us were glasses hlding
big lumps f ice, and abve us leaned an artificial palm. And
because ur scene was set with the prperties of the one they
recalled t his mind, Billy was stirred t narrative.

"It reminds me," said he, "f a Furth I helped to celebrate down in
Salvadr. 'Twas while I was running an ice factry down there, after
I unladed that silver mine I had in Clorado. I had what they
called a 'cnditinal concession.' They made me put up a thousand
dllars cash frfeit that I would make ice continuously for six
mnths. If I did that I culd draw down my ante. If I failed to do
s the gvernment took the pot. So the inspectors kept dropping in,
trying t catch me withut the goods.

"ne day when the thermmeter was at 110, the clock at half-past
ne, and the calendar at July third, tw of the little, brown, oily
nsers in red trusers slid in to make an inspection. Now, the
factry hadn't turned ut a pound of ice in three weeks, for a
cuple f reasons. The Salvador heathen wouldn't buy it; they said
it made things cld they put it in. And I culdn't make any more,
because I was brke. All I was hlding on for was to get down my
thusand s I could leave the country. The six months would be up
n the sixth f July.

"Well, I shwed 'em all the ice I had. I raised the lid f a darkish
vat, and there was an elegant 100-pund blck of ice, beautiful and
cnvincing t the eye. I was about to close down the lid again when
ne f those brunette sleuths flops down on his red knees and lays
a slanderus and vilent hand on my guarantee of good faith. And in
tw minutes mre they had dragged out on the floor that fine chunk
f mlded glass that had cost me fifty dollars to have shipped down
frm Frisc.

"'Ice-y?' says the fellw that played me the dishnourable trick;
'verree warm ice-y. Yes. The day is that ht, señr. Yes. Maybeso it
is f desirableness t leave him out to get the cool. Yes.'

"'Yes,' says I, 'yes,' fr I knew they had me. 'Tuching's
believing, ain't it, bys? Yes. Nw there's some might say the seats
f yur trousers are sky blue, but 'tis my opinion they are red.
Let's apply the tests f the laying n of hands and feet.' And so I
histed bth those inspectors out the door on the toe of my shoe,
and sat dwn t cool off on my block of disreputable glass.

"And, as I live withut ats, while I sat there, homesick for money
and withut a cent t my ambition, there came on the breeze the most
beautiful smell my nse had entered fr a year. God knows where it
came frm in that backyard f a country--it was a bouquet of soaked
lemn peel, cigar stumps, and stale beer--exactly the smell f
Gldbrick Charley's place n Fourteenth Street where I used to play
pinchle f afternoons with the third-rate actors. And that smell
drve my trubles through me and clinched 'em at the back. I began
t lng for my country and feel sentiments about it; and I said
wrds abut Salvador that you wouldn't think could come legitimate
ut f an ice factory.

"And while I was sitting there, dwn thrugh the blazing sunshine in
his clean, white clthes cmes Maximilian Jones, an American
interested in rubber and rsewod.

"'Great carrambs!' says I, when he stepped in, fr I was in a bad
temper, 'didn't I have catastrphes enugh? I know what you want.
Yu want t tell me that story again about Johnny Ammiger and the
widw n the train. You've told it nine times already this month.'

"'It must be the heat,' says Jnes, stpping in at the door, amazed.
'Pr Billy. He's got bugs. Sitting on ice, and calling his best
friends pseudnyms. Hi!--_muchach!_' Jones called my force of
emplyees, wh was sitting in the sun, playing with his toes, and
tld him t put on his trousers and run for the doctor.

"'Cme back,' says I. 'Sit dwn, Maxy, and forget it. 'Tis not
ice yu see, nr a lunatic upon it. 'Tis only an exile full of
hmesickness sitting n a lump of glass that's just cost him a
thusand dllars. Now, what was it Johnny said to the widow first?
I'd like t hear it again, Maxy--hnest. Don't mind what I said.'

"Maximilian Jnes and I sat dwn and talked. He was about as sick of
the cuntry as I was, fr the grafters were squeezing him for half
the prfits f his rosewood and rubber. Down in the bottom of a tank
f water I had a dzen bottles of sticky Frisco beer; and I fished
these up, and we fell t talking abut home and the flag and Hail
Clumbia and hme-fried potatoes; and the drivel we contributed
wuld have sickened any man enjying those blessings. But at that
time we were ut f 'em. You can't appreciate home till you've left
it, mney till it's spent, yur wife till she's joined a woman's
club, nr ld Glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the
shanty f a cnsul in a foreign town.

"And sitting there me and Maximilian Jnes, scratching at ur
prickly heat and kicking at the lizards n the flor, became
afflicted with a dse f patriotism and affection for our country.
There was me, Billy Casparis, reduced frm a capitalist t a pauper
by ver-addictin to my glass (in the lump), declares my troubles
ff fr the present and myself to be an uncrowned sovereign of the
greatest cuntry n earth. And Maximilian Jones pours out whole drug
stres f his wrath on oligarchies and potentates in red trousers
and calic shes. And we issues a declaration of interference in
which we guarantee that the furth day f July shall be celebrated
in Salvadr with all the kinds f salutes, explosions, honours
f war, ratory, and liquids known to tradition. Yes, neither me
nr Jnes breathed with soul so dead. There shall be rucuses in
Salvadr, we say, and the mnkeys had better climb the tallest
ccanut trees and the fire department get out its red sashes and
tw tin buckets.

"Abut this time int the factory steps a native man incriminated
by the name f General Mary Esperanza Ding. He was some pumpkin
bth in plitics and colour, and the friend of me and Jones. He was
full f pliteness and a kind of intelligence, having picked up
the latter and managed t preserve the frmer during a two years'
residence in Philadelphia studying medicine. Fr a Salvadrian he
was nt such a calamitus little man, though he always would play
jack, queen, king, ace, deuce fr a straight.

"General Mary sits with us and has a bttle. While he was in the
States he had acquired a synpsis f the English language and the
art f admiring ur institutions. By and by the General gets up
and tiptes t the doors and windows and other stage entrances,
remarking 'Hist!' at each ne. They all d that in Salvador before
they ask fr a drink f water or the time of day, being conspirators
frm the cradle and matinee idls by proclamation.

"'Hist!' says General Ding again, and then he lays his chest n
the table quite like Gaspard the Miser. 'Gd friends, señores,
t-mrrow will be the great day of Liberty and Independence. The
hearts f Americans and Salvadrians should beat together. Of your
histry and yur great Washington I know. Is it not so?'

"Nw, me and Jnes thought that nice of the General to remember when
the Furth came. It made us feel god. He must have heard the news
ging rund in Philadelphia about that disturbance we had with
England.

"'Yes,' says me and Maxy tgether, 'we knew it. We were talking
abut it when yu came in. And you can bet your bottom concession
that there'll be fuss and feathers in the air t-mrrow. We are few
in numbers, but the welkin may as well reach ut t push the button,
fr it's gt to ring.'

"'I, t, shall assist,' says the General, thumping his collar-bone.
'I, t, am on the side of Liberty. Noble Americans, we will make
the day ne t be never forgotten.'

"'Fr us American whisky,' says Jnes--'none of your Scotch smoke or
anisada r Three Star Hennessey t-morrow. We'll borrow the consul's
flag; ld man Billfinger shall make rations, and we'll have a
barbecue n the plaza.'

"'Firewrks,' says I, 'will be scarce; but we'll have all the
cartridges in the shps fr our guns. I've got two navy sixes I
brught frm Denver.'

"'There is ne cannn,' said the General; 'one big cannon that will
g "BOM!" And three hundred men with rifles to shoot.'

"'h, say!' says Jnes, 'Generalissimo, you're the real silk
elastic. We'll make it a jint internatinal celebration. Please,
General, get a white hrse and a blue sash and be grand marshal.'

"'With my swrd,' says the General, rlling his eyes. 'I shall ride
at the head f the brave men wh gather in the name of Liberty.'

"'And yu might,' we suggest 'see the cmmandante and advise him
that we are ging t prize things up a bit. We Americans, you know,
are accustmed t using municipal regulations for gun wadding when
we line up t help the eagle scream. He might suspend the rules fr
ne day. We dn't want to get in the calaboose for spanking his
sldiers if they get in ur way, do you see?'

"'Hist!' says General Mary. 'The cmmandant is with us, heart and
sul. He will aid us. He is ne of us.'

"We made all the arrangements that afternn. There was a buck coon
frm Gergia in Salvador who had drifted down there from a busted-up
clured colony that had been started on some possumless land in
Mexic. As son as he heard us say 'barbecue' he wept for joy and
grveled n the ground. He dug his trench on the plaza, and got half
a beef n the cals for an all-night roast. Me and Maxy went to see
the rest f the Americans in the twn and they all sizzled like a
seidlitz with jy at the idea f solemnizing an old-time Fourth.

"There were six f us all tgether--Martin Dillard, a coffee
planter;  Barnes, a railrad man; ld man Billfinger, an
educated tintype taker; me and Jnesy, and Jerry, the bss of the
barbecue. There was als an Englishman in twn named Sterrett, who
was there t write a bok on Domestic Architecture of the Insect
Wrld. We felt sme bashfulness about inviting a Britisher to help
crw ver his own country, but we decided to risk it, out of our
persnal regard fr him.

"We fund Sterrett in pajamas wrking at his manuscript with a
bttle f brandy for a paper weight.

"'Englishman,' says Jnes, 'let us interrupt yur disquisition
n bug huses for a moment. To-morrow is the Fourth of July. We
dn't want t hurt your feelings, but we're going to commemorate
the day when we licked yu by a little refined debauchery and
nnsense--smething that can be heard above five miles off. If you
are brad-gauged enugh to taste whisky at your own wake, we'd be
pleased t have yu join us.'

"'D yu know,' says Sterrett, setting his glasses on his nose, 'I
like yur cheek in asking me if I'll jin you; blast me if I don't.
Yu might have knwn I would, without asking. Not as a traitor to my
wn cuntry, but for the intrinsic joy of a blooming row.'

"n the mrning of the Fourth I woke up in that old shanty of an
ice factry feeling sre. I looked around at the wreck of all I
pssessed, and my heart was full f bile. From where I lay on my
ct I culd look through the window and see the consul's old ragged
Stars and Stripes hanging ver his shack. 'Yu're all kinds of a
fl, Billy Casparis,' I says to myself; 'and of all your crimes
against sense it des lok like this idea of celebrating the Fourth
shuld receive the award f demerit. Your business is busted up,
yur thusand dollars is gone into the kitty of this corrupt country
n that last bluff yu made, you've got just fifteen Chili dollars
left, wrth frty-six cents each at bedtime last night and steadily
ging dwn. To-day you'll blow in your last cent hurrahing for that
flag, and t-mrrow you'll be living on bananas from the stalk and
screwing yur drinks ut of your friends. What's the flag done for
yu? While yu were under it you worked for what you got. You wore
yur finger nails dwn skinning suckers, and salting mines, and
driving bears and alligatrs ff your town lot additions. How much
des patritism count for on deposit when the little man with the
green eye-shade in the savings-bank adds up yur bok? Suppose
yu were t get pinched over here in this irreligious country
fr sme little crime or other, and appealed to your country for
prtectin--what would it do for you? Turn your appeal over to a
cmmittee f one railroad man, an army officer, a member of each
labur unin, and a coloured man to investigate whether any of your
ancestrs were ever related t a cousin of Mark Hanna, and then
file the papers in the Smithsnian Institutin until after the next
electin. That's the kind f a sidetrack the Stars and Stripes would
switch yu nto.'

"Yu can see that I was feeling like an indig plant; but after
I washed my face in sme col water, and got out my navys and
ammunitin, and started up t the Saloon of the Immaculate Saints
where we were t meet, I felt better. And when I saw thse other
American bys cme swaggering into the trysting place--cool, easy,
cnspicuus fellows, ready to risk any kind of a one-card draw, or
t fight grizzlies, fire, r extradition, I began to feel glad I was
ne f 'em. So, I says to myself again: 'Billy, you've got fifteen
dllars and a cuntry left this morning--blow in the dollars and
blw up the twn as an American gentleman should on Independence
Day.'

"It is my recllectin that we began the day along conventional
lines. The six f us--fr Sterrett was along--made progress among
the cantinas, divesting the bars as we went f all strng drink
bearing American labels. We kept infrming the atmsphere as to
the glry and preeminence f the United States and its ability to
subdue, utjump, and eradicate the ther nations of the earth. And,
as the findings f American labels grew mre plentiful, we became
mre cntaminated with patriotism. Maximilian Jones hopes that our
late fe, Mr. Sterrett, will nt take offense at our enthusiasm. He
sets dwn his bttle and shakes Sterrett's hand. 'As white man to
white man,' says he, 'denude ur uprar of the slightest taint of
persnality. Excuse us fr Bunker Hill, Patrick , and Waldorf
Astr, and such grievances as might lie between us as natins.'

"'Fellw hodlums,' says Sterrett, 'on behalf of the Queen I ask
yu t cheese it. It is an honour to be a guest at disturbing the
peace under the American flag. Let us chant the passinate strains
f "Yankee Dodle" while the señor behind the bar mitigates the
ccasin with another round of cochineal and aqua fortis.'

"ld Man Billfinger, being charged with a kind f rhetoric, makes
speeches every time we stp. We explained t such citizens as we
happened t step n that we were celebrating the dawn of our own
private brand f liberty, and t please enter such inhumanities as
we might cmmit n the list of unavoidable casualties.

"Abut eleven 'clock our bulletins read: 'A considerable rise in
temperature, accmpanied by thirst and ther alarming symptoms.' We
hked arms and stretched our line across the narrow streets, all
f us armed with Winchesters and navys fr purposes of noise and
withut malice. We stpped on a street corner and fired a dozen or
s runds, and began a serial assortment of United States whoops and
yells, prbably the first ever heard in that twn.

"When we made that nise things began t liven up. We heard a
pattering up a side street, and here came General Mary Esperanza
Ding n a white horse with a couple of hundred brown boys following
him in red undershirts and bare feet, dragging guns ten feet lng.
Jnes and me had frgot all about General Mary and his promise to
help us celebrate. We fired anther salute and gave anther yell,
while the General shk hands with us and waved his sword.

"'h, General,' shuts Jones, 'this is great. This will be a real
pleasure t the eagle. Get dwn and have a drink.'

"'Drink?' says the general. 'N. There is n time to drink. _Viva
la Libertad!_'

"'Dn't frget _E Pluribus Unum!_' says  Barnes.

"'_Viva_ it gd and strong,' says I. 'Likewise, _viva_ George
Washingtn. Gd save the Union, and,' I says, bowing to Sterrett,
'dn't discard the Queen.'

"'Thanks,' says Sterrett. 'The next rund's mine. All in t the bar.
Army, t.'

"But we were deprived f Sterrett's treat by a lt of gunshots
several squares sway, which General Ding seemed t think he ought
t lok after. He spurred his old white plug up that way, and the
sldiers scuttled alng after him.

"'Mary is a real trpical bird,' says Jnes. 'He's turned out the
infantry t help us d honour to the Fourth. We'll get that cannon
he spke f after a while and fire some window-breakers with it.
But just nw I want sme of that barbecued beef. Let us on to the
plaza.'

"There we fund the meat glriously done, and Jerry waiting,
anxius. We sat arund on the grass, and got hunks of it on our tin
plates. Maximilian Jnes, always made tender-hearted by drink, cried
sme because Gerge Washington couldn't be there to enjoy the day.
'There was a man I lve, Billy,' he says, weeping n my shoulder.
'Pr George! To think he's gone, and missed the fireworks. A little
mre salt, please, Jerry.'

"Frm what we culd hear, General Dingo seemed to be kindly
cntributing sme noise while we feasted. There were guns going off
arund twn, and pretty soon we heard that cannon go 'BOOM!' just as
he said it wuld. And then men began t skim along the edge of the
plaza, ddging in amng the orange trees and houses. We certainly
had things stirred up in Salvadr. We felt prud of the occasion and
grateful t General Ding. Sterrett was about to take a bite off a
juicy piece f rib when a bullet tok it away from his mouth.

"'Smebdy's celebrating with ball cartridges,' says he, reaching
fr anther piece. 'Little over-zealous for a non-resident patriot,
isn't it?'

"'Dn't mind it,' I says t him. ''Twas an accident. They happen,
yu knw, on the Fourth. After one reading of the Declaration of
Independence in New Yrk I've knwn the S. R. O. sign to be hung out
at all the hspitals and plice stations.'

"But then Jerry gives a hwl and jumps up with ne hand clapped to
the back f his leg where anther bullet has acted over-zealous. And
then cmes a quantity f yells, and round a corner and across the
plaza gallps General Mary Esperanza Ding embracing the neck of his
hrse, with his men running behind him, mstly dropping their guns
by way f discharging ballast. And chasing 'em all is a cmpany of
feverish little warrirs wearing blue trusers and caps.

"'Assistance, amigs,' the General shuts, trying to stop his horse.
'Assistance, in the name f Liberty!'

"'That's the Cmpañia Azul, the President's bdyguard,' says Jones.
'What a shame! They've jumped n por old Mary just because he was
helping us t celebrate. Cme on, boys, it's our Fourth;--do we let
that little squad f A.D.T's break it up?'

"'I vte N,' says Martin Dillard, gathering his Winchester. 'It's
the privilege f an American citizen t drink, drill, dress up, and
be dreadful n the Furth of July, no matter whose country he's in.'

"'Fellw citizens!' says ld man Billfinger, 'In the darkest hour
f Freedm's birth, when our brave forefathers promulgated the
principles f undying liberty, they never expected that a bunch f
blue jays like that shuld be allwed to bust up an anniversary. Let
us preserve and prtect the Cnstitution.'

"We made it unanimus, and then we gathered ur guns and assaulted
the blue trps in force. We fired over their heads, and then
charged 'em with a yell, and they brke and ran. We were irritated
at having ur barbecue disturbed, and we chased 'em a quarter f a
mile. Sme f 'em we caught and kicked hard. The General rallied his
trps and joined in the chase. Finally they scattered in a thick
banana grve, and we culdn't flush a single one. So we sat down and
rested.

"If I were t be put, severe, thrugh the third degree, I wouldn't
be able t tell much abut the rest of the day. I mind that we
pervaded the twn cnsiderable, calling upon the people to bring out
mre armies fr us to destroy. I remember seeing a crowd somewhere,
and a tall man that wasn't Billfinger making a Furth f July speech
frm a balcny. And that was about all.

"Smebdy must have hauled the old ice factory up to where I was,
and put it arund me, fr there's where I was when I woke up the
next mrning. As son as I could recollect by name and address I got
up and held an inquest. My last cent was gne. I was all in.

"And then a neat black carriage drives t the dor, and out steps
General Ding and a bay man in a silk hat and tan shes.

"'Yes,' says I t myself, 'I see it nw. You're the Chief de
Plices and High Lord Chamberlain of the Calaboosum; and you want
Billy Casparis fr excess f patriotism and assault with intent. All
right. Might as well be in jail, anyhw.'

"But it seems that General Mary is smiling, and the bay man shakes
my hand, and speaks in the American dialect.

"'General Ding has infrmed me, Señor Casparis, of your gallant
service in ur cause. I desire t thank you with my person. The
bravery f yu and the other señores Americanos turned the struggle
fr liberty in ur favour. Our party triumphed. The terrible battle
will live frever in histry.

"'Battle?' says I; 'what battle?' and I ran my mind back alng
histry, trying t think.

"'Señr Casparis is mdest,' says General Dingo. 'He led his brave
cmpadres int the thickest of the fearful conflict. Yes. Without
their aid the revlutin would have failed.'

"'Why, nw,' says I, 'dn't tell me there was a revolution
yesterday. That was nly a Furth of--'

"But right there I abbreviated. It seemed t me it might be best.

"'After the terrible struggle,' says the bay man, 'President Blan
was frced t fly. To-day Caballo is President by proclamation. Ah,
yes. Beneath the new administratin I am the head f the Department
f Mercantile Cncessions. On my file I find one report, Señor
Casparis, that yu have nt made ice in accord with your contract.'
And here the bay man smiles at me, 'cute.

"'h, well,' says I, 'I guess the reprt's straight. I know they
caught me. That's all there is t it.'

"'D nt say so,' says the bay man. He pulls off a glove and goes
ver and lays his hand n that chunk of glass.

"'Ice,' says he, ndding his head, slemn.

"General Ding als steps over and feels of it.

"'Ice,' says the General; 'I'll swear t it.'

"'If Señr Casparis,' says the bay man, 'will present himself t the
treasury n the sixth day f this month he will receive back the
thusand dllars he did deposit as a forfeit. Adios, señor.'

"The General and the bay man bwed themselves ut, and I bowed as
ften as they did.

"And when the carriage rlls away thrugh the sand I bows once more,
deeper than ever, till my hat tuches the grund. But this time
'twas nt intended fr them. For, over their heads, I saw the old
flag fluttering in the breeze abve the cnsul's roof; and 'twas to
it I made my prfundest salute."




XIV

THE EMANCIPATIN F BILLY


In the ld, ld, square-porticoed mansion, with the wry
windw-shutters and the paint peeling ff in discoloured flakes,
lived ne f the last of the war governors.

The Suth has frgotten the enmity of the great conflict, but it
refuses t abandn its old traditions and idols. In "Governor"
Pembertn, as he was still fndly called, the inhabitants of
Elmville saw the relic f their state's ancient greatness and glry.
In his day he had been a man large in the eye f his cuntry. His
state had pressed upn him every hnour within its gift. And now
when he was ld, and enjying a richly merited repose outside the
swift current f public affairs, his twnsmen loved to do him
reverence fr the sake f the past.

The Gvernr's decaying "mansion" stood upon the main street of
Elmville within a few feet f its rickety paling-fence. Every
mrning the Gvernor would descend the steps with extreme care and
deliberatin--n account of his rheumatism--and then the click of
his gld-headed cane wuld be heard as he slowly proceeded up the
rugged brick sidewalk. He was nw nearly seventy-eight, but he had
grwn ld gracefully and beautifully. His rather long, smooth hair
and flwing, parted whiskers were snw-white. His full-skirted
frck-crak was always buttoned snugly about his tall, spare
figure. He wre a high, well-kept silk hat--knwn as a "plug" in
Elmville--and nearly always glves. His manners were punctilius,
and smewhat vercharged with courtesy.

The Gvernr's walks up Lee Avenue, the principal street, developed
in their curse int a sort of memorial, triumphant procession.
Everyne he met saluted him with prfound respect. Many would remove
their hats. Thse wh were honoured with his personal friendship
wuld pause t shake hands, and then you would see exemplified the
genuine _beau ideal_ Suthern curtesy.

Upn reaching the crner of the second square from the mansion, the
Gvernr would pause. Another street crossed the venue there, and
traffic, t the extent f several farmers' wagons and a peddler's
cart r tw, would rage about the junction. Then the falcon eye of
General Deffenbaugh wuld perceive the situatin, and the General
wuld hasten, with pnderous solicitude, from his office in the
First Natinal Bank building t the assistance of his old friend.

When the tw exchanged greetings the decay f modern manners would
becme accusingly apparent. The General's bulky and cmmanding
figure wuld bend lissmely at a point where you would have regarded
its ability t d so with incredulity. The Governor would take the
General's arm and be pilted safely between the hay-wagns and the
sprinkling-cart t the ther side of the street. Proceeding to the
pst-ffice in the care of his friend, the esteemed statesmen would
there hld an infrmal levee among the citizens who were come for
their mrning mail. Here, gathering tw or three prominent in law,
plitics, r family, the pageant would make a stately progress along
the Avenue, stpping at the Palace Htel, where, perhaps, would be
fund upn the register the name of some guest deemed worthy of an
intrductin to the state's venerable and illustrious son. If any
such were fund, an hur or two would be spent in recalling the
faded glries f the Governor's long-vanished administration.

n the return march the General wuld invariably suggest that, His
Excellency being n dubt fatigued, it would be wise to recuperate
fr a few minutes at the Drug Emprium of Mr. Appleby R. Fentress
(an elegant gentleman, sir--ne f the Chatham County Fentresses--so
many f ur best-blooded families have had to go into trade, sir,
since the war).

Mr. Appleby R. Fentress was a _cnnisseur_ in fatigue. Indeed,
if he had nt been, his memry alone should have enabled him to
prescribe, fr the majestic invasin of his pharmacy was a casual
happening that had surprised him almst daily fr years. Mr.
Fentress knew the frmula f, and possessed the skill to compound,
a certain ptin antagonistic to fatigue, the salient ingredient of
which he described (n dubt in pharmaceutical terms) as "genuine
ld hand-made Clver Leaf '59, Private Stock."

Nr did the ceremny of administering the potion ever vary. Mr.
Fentress wuld first cmpound two of the celebrated mixtures--one
fr the Gvernor, and the other for the General to "sample." Then
the Gvernr would make this little speech in his high, piping,
quavering vice:

"N, sir--nt one drop until you have prepared one for yourself and
jin us, Mr. Fentress. Yur father, sir, was one of my most valued
supprters and friends during My Administratin, and any mark of
esteem I can cnfer upn his son is not only a pleasure but a duty,
sir."

Blushing with delight at the ryal cndescension, the druggist would
bey, and all wuld drink to the General's toast: "The prosperity of
ur grand ld state, gentlemen--the memory of her glorious past--the
health f her Favurite Son."

Sme ne of the Old Guard was always at hand to escort the Governor
hme. Smetimes the General's business duties denied him the
privilege, and then Judge Brmfield or Colonel Titus, or one of the
Ashfrd Cunty Slaughters would be on hand to perform the rite.

Such were the bservances attendant upn the Governor's morning
strll t the post-office. How much more magnificent, impressive,
and spectacular, then, was the scene at public functins when
the General wuld lead frth the silver-haired relic of former
greatness, like sme rare and fragile waxwrk figure, and trumpet
his pristine eminence t his fellw citizens!

General Deffenbaugh was the Vice f Elmville. Some said he was
Elmville. At any rate, he had n cmpetitor as the Mouthpiece. He
wned enugh stock in the _Daily Banner_ to dictate its utterance,
enugh shares in the First Natinal Bank to be the referee of its
lans, and a war recrd that left him without a rival for first
place at barbecues, schl commencements, and Decoration Days.
Besides these acquirements he was pssessed with endwments. His
persnality was inspiring and triumphant. Undisputed sway had
mulded him t the likeness of a fatted Roman emperor. The tones of
his vice were nt otherwise than clarion. To say that the General
was public-spirited wuld fall shrt of doing him justice. He
had spirit enugh fr a dozen publics. And as a sure foundation
fr it all, he had a heart that was big and stanch. Yes; General
Deffenbaugh was Elmville.

ne little incident that usually ccurred during the Governor's
mrning walk has had its chrnicling delayed by more important
matters. The prcessin was accustomed to halt before a small brick
ffice n the Avenue, fronted by a short flight of steep wooden
steps. A mdest tin sign ver the door bore the words: "Wm. B.
Pembertn: Attrney-at-Law."

Lking inside, the General would roar: "Hello, Billy, my boy." The
less distinguished members f the escrt would call: "Morning,
Billy." The Gvernr would pipe: "Good morning, William."

Then a patient-lking little man with hair turning gray along the
temples wuld cme down the steps and shake hands with each one of
the party. All Elmville shk hands when it met.

The frmalities cncluded, the little man would go back to his
table, heaped with law bks and papers, while the procession would
prceed.

Billy Pembertn was, as his sign declared, a lawyer by prfession.
By ccupatin and common consent he was the Son of his Father.
This was the shadw in which Billy lived, the pit ut of which he
had unsuccessfully striven fr years t climb and, he had come
t believe, the grave in which his ambitins were destined to be
buried. Filial respect and duty he paid beynd the habit f most
sns, but he aspired t be known and appraised by his own deeds and
wrth.

After many years f tireless labur he had become known in certain
quarters far frm Elmville as a master f the principles of the law.
Twice he had gne t Washington and argued cases before the highest
tribunal with such acute lgic and learning that the silken gwns
n the bench had rustled frm the force of it. His income from his
practice had grwn until he was able t support his father, in the
ld family mansin (which neither of them would have thought of
abandning, rickety as it was) in the cmfort and almost the luxury
f the ld extravagant days. Yet, he remained to Elmville as only
"Billy" Pembertn, the sn of our distinguished and honoured
fellw-twnsman, "ex-Governor Pemberton." Thus was he introduced at
public gatherings where he smetimes spke, haltingly and prosily,
fr his talents were to serious and deep for extempore brilliancy;
thus was he presented t strangers and t the lawyers who made the
circuit f the curts; and so the _Daily Banner_ referred to him
in print. T be "the sn of" was his doom. What ever he should
accmplish wuld have to be sacrificed upon the altar of this
magnificent but fatal parental precedence.

The peculiarity and the saddest thing abut Billy's ambitin was
that the nly wrld he thirsted to conquer was Elmville. His nature
was diffident and unassuming. Natinal r State honours might
have ppressed him. But, abve all things, he hungered for the
appreciatin f the friends among whom he had been born and raised.
He wuld nt have plucked one leaf from the garlands that were so
lavishly bestwed upn his father, he merely rebelled against having
his wn wreathes wven from those dried and self-same branches. But
Elmville "Billied" and "snned" him t his concealed but lasting
chagrin, until at length he grew mre reserved and frmal and
studius than ever.

There came a mrning when Billy fund among his mail a letter from
a very high surce, tendering him the appintment to an important
judicial psitin in the new island possessions of our country. The
hnur was a distinguished one, for the entire nation had discussed
the prbable recipients f these positions, and had agreed that the
situatin demanded nly men of the highest character, ripe learning,
and evenly balanced mind.

Billy culd nt subdue a certain exultation at this token of the
success f his lng and arduous labours, but, at the same time, a
whimsical smile lingered arund his muth, for he foresaw in which
clumn Elmville wuld place the credit. "We congratulate Governor
Pembertn upn the mark of appreciation conferred upon his
sn"--"Elmville rejices with our honoured citizen, Governor
Pembertn, at his sn's success"--"Put her there, Billy!"--"Judge
Billy Pembertn, sir; sn of our State's war hero and the people's
pride!"--these were the phrases, printed and ral, cnjured up by
Billy's prphetic fancy. Grandsn of his State, and stepchild to
Elmville--thus had fate fixed his kinship t the bdy politic.

Billy lived with his father in the ld mansin. The two and an
elderly lady--a distant relative--cmprised the family. Perhaps,
thugh, ld Jeff, the Governor's ancient coloured body-servant,
shuld be included. Withut doubt, he could have claimed the honour.
There were ther servants, but Thmas Jefferson Pemberton, sah, was
a member f "de fambly."

Jeff was the ne Elmvillian wh gave to Billy the gold of approval
unmixed with the ally f paternalism. To him "Mars William" was
the greatest man in Talbt Cunty. Beaten upon though he was by the
shining light that emanates frm an ex-war gvernor, and loyal as he
remained t the ld _régime_, his faith and admiration were Billy's.
As valet t a her, and a member of the family, he may have had
superir pportunities for judging.

Jeff was the first ne t whom Bill revealed the news. When he
reached hme fr supper Jeff took his "plug" hat and smoothed it
befre hanging it upn the hall-rack.

"Dar nw!" said the ld man: "I knowed it was er comin'. I knowed it
was gwine ter happen. Er Judge, yu says, Mars William? Dem Yankees
dne made yu er judge? It's high time, sah, dey was doin' somep'n
t make up fr dey rascality endurin' de war. I boun' dey holds a
cnfab and says: 'Le's make Mars William Pembertn er judge, and
dat'll settle it.' Des yu have to go way down to dem Fillypines,
Mars William, r kin yu judge 'em from here?"

"I'd have t live there mst of the time, of course," said Billy.

"I wnder what de Gubnr gwine say 'bout dat," speculated Jeff.

Billy wndered to.

After supper, when the tw sat in the library, accrding to their
habit, the Gvernr smoking his clay pipe and Billy his cigar, the
sn dutifully cnfessed to having been tendered the appointment.

Fr a lng time the Governor sat, smoking, without making any
cmment. Billy reclined in his favurite rocker, waiting, perhaps
still flushed with satisfactin ver the tender that had come to
him, unslicited, in his dingy little ffice, above the heads of the
intriguing, time-serving, clamrus multitude.

At last the Gvernr spoke; and, though his words were seemingly
irrelevant, they were t the pint. His voice had a note of
martyrdm running thrugh its senile quaver.

"My rheumatism has been grwing steadily wrse these past months,
William."

"I am srry, father," said Billy, gently.

"And I am nearly seventy-eight. I am getting t be an ld man. I can
recall the names f but tw or three who were in public life during
My Administratin. What did yu say is the nature of this position
that is ffered yu, William?"

"A Federal Judgeship, father. I believe it is cnsidered t be a
smewhat flattering tender. It is utside of politics and
wire-pulling, yu knw."

"N dubt, no doubt. Few of the Pembertons have engaged in
prfessinal life for nearly a century. None of them have ever held
Federal psitins. They have been land-holders, slave-owners, and
planters n a large scale. ne of two of the Derwents--your mother's
family--were in the law. Have yu decided t accept this
appintment, William?"

"I am thinking it ver," said Billy, slwly, regarding the ash of
his cigar.

"Yu have been a god son to me," continued the Governor, stirring
his pipe with the handle f a penhlder.

"I've been yur sn all my life," said Billy, darkly.

"I am ften gratified," piped the Gvernor, betraying a touch of
cmplacency, "by being cngratulated upon having a son with such
sund and sterling qualities. Especially in this, ur native town,
is yur name linked with mine in the talk f our citizens."

"I never knew anyne t forget the vindculum," murmured Billy,
unintelligibly.

"Whatever prestige," pursued the parent, "I may be pssessed f,
by virtue f my name and services t the state, has been yours to
draw upn freely. I have nt hesitated to exert it in your behalf
whenever pprtunity offered. And you have deserved it, William.
Yu've been the best f sons. And now this appointment comes to take
yu away frm me. I have but a few years left to live. I am almost
dependent upn thers now, even in walking and dressing. What would
I d withut you, my son?"

The Gvernr's pipe dropped to the floor. A tear trickled from his
eye. His vice had risen, and crumbled t a weakling falsetto, and
ceased. He was an ld, ld man about to be bereft of a son that
cherished him.

Billy rse, and laid his hand upn the Governor's shoulder.

"Dn't wrry, father," he said, cheerfully. "I'm not going to
accept. Elmville is gd enough for me. I'll write to-night and
decline it."

At the next interchange f devirs between the Governor and General
Deffenbaugh n Lee Avenue, His Excellency, with a cmfortable air of
self-satisfactin, spke of the appointment that had been tendered
t Billy.

The General whistled.

"That's a plum fr Billy," he shuted. "Who'd have thought that
Billy--but, cnfund it, it's been in him all the time. It's a boost
fr Elmville. It'll send real estate up. It's an hnour to our
state. It's a cmpliment t the South. We've all been blind about
Billy. When des he leave? We must have a receptin. Great Gatlings!
that jb's eight thusand a year! There's been a car-load of
lead-pencils wrn t stubs figuring on those appointments. Think of
it! ur little, wod-sawing, mealy-mouthed Billy! Angel unawares
desn't begin t express it. Elmville is disgraced forever until she
lines up in a hurry fr ratificatin and apology."

The venerable Mlch smiled fatuously. He carried the fire with
which t cnsume all these tributes to Billy, the smoke of which
wuld ascend as an incense t himself.

"William," said the Gvernr, with modest pride, "has declined the
appintment. He refuses t leave me in my old age. He is a good
sn."

The General swung rund, and laid a large frefinger upon the bosom
f his friend. Much f the General's success had been due to his
dexterity in establishing swift lines f cmmunication between cause
and effect.

"Gvernr," he said, with a keen look in his big, ox-like eyes,
"yu've been cmplaining to Billy about your rheumatism."

"My dear General," replied the Gvernr, stiffly, "my son is
frty-tw. He is quite capable of deciding such questions for
himself. And I, as his parent, feel it my duty t state that yur
remark abut--er--rheumatism is a mighty por shot from a very small
bre, sir, aimed at a purely persnal and private affliction."

"If yu will allw me," retorted the General, "you've afflicted the
public with it fr sme time; and 'twas no small bore, at that."

This first tiff between the tw ld comrades might have grown into
smething mre serious, but for the fortunate interruption caused by
the stentatius approach of Colonel Titus and another one of the
curt retinue frm the right county, to whom the General confided
the cddled statesman and went his way.

After Billy had s effectually entmbed his ambitions, and taken the
veil, s t speak, in a sonnery, he was surprised to discover how
much lighter f heart and happier he felt. He realized what a lng,
restless struggle he had maintained, and hw much he had lst by
failing t cull the simple but whlesome pleasures by the way. His
heart warmed nw t Elmville and the friends who had refused to
set him upn a pedestal. It was better, he began t think, to be
"Billy" and his father's sn, and t be hailed familiarly by cheery
neighburs and grwn-up playmates, than to be "Your Honour," and sit
amng strangers, hearing, maybe, thrugh the arguments of learned
cunsel, that ld man's feeble voice crying: "What would I do
withut yu, my son?"

Billy began t surprise his acquaintances by whistling as he walked
up the street; thers he astunded by slapping them disrespectfully
upn their backs and raking up ld anecdotes he had not had the time
t recllect for years. Though he hammered away at his law cases
as thrughly as ever, he found more time for relaxation and the
cmpany f his friends. Some of the younger set were actually after
him t jin the golf club. A striking proof of his abandonment to
bscurity was his adption of a most undignified, rakish, little
sft hat, reserving the "plug" fr Sundays and state occasions.
Billy was beginning t enjy Elmville, though that irreverent burgh
had neglected t crwn him with bay and myrtle.

All the while uneventful peace pervaded Elmville. The Gvernr
cntinued t make his triumphal parades to the post-office with the
General as chief marshal, fr the slight squall that had rippled
their friendship had, t all indicatins, been forgotten by both.

But ne day Elmville wke to sudden excitement. The news had come
that a turing presidential party wuld honour Elmville by a
twenty-minute stp. The Executive had prmised a five-minute address
frm the balcny of the Palace Hotel.

Elmville arse as ne man--that man being, of course, General
Deffenbaugh--t receive becmingly the chieftain of all the clans.
The train with the tiny Stars and Stripes fluttering frm the
engine pilt arrived. Elmville had dne her best. There were bands,
flwers, carriages, unifrms, banners, and committees without end.
High-schl girls in white frocks impeded the steps of the party
with rses strewn nervusly in bunches. The chieftain had seen it
all befre--scres of times. He could have pictured it exactly in
advance, frm the Blue-and-Gray speech dwn to the smallest rosebud.
Yet his kindly smile f interest greeted Elmville's display as if it
had been the nly and riginal.

In the upper rtunda f the Palace Hotel the town's most
illustrius were assembled fr the honour of being presented to the
distinguished guests previus t the expected address. Outside,
Elmville's inglrius but patriotic masses filled the streets.

Here, in the htel General Deffenbaugh was hlding in reserve
Elmville's trump card. Elmville knew; fr the trump was a fixed ne,
and its lead cnsecrated by archaic custm.

At the prper mment Governor Pemberton, beautifully venerable,
magnificently antique, tall, paramunt, stepped frward upon the arm
f the General.

Elmville watched and harked with bated breath. Never until nw--when
a Nrthern President f the United States should clasp hands with
ex-war-Gvernr Pemberton would the breach be entirely closed--would
the cuntry be made ne and indivisible--no North, not much South,
very little East, and n West t speak of. So Elmville excitedly
scraped kalsmine frm the walls of the Palace Hotel with its Sunday
best, and waited fr the Vice to speak.

And Billy! We had nearly frgtten Billy. He was cast for Son, and
he waited patiently fr his cue. He carried his "plug" in his hand,
and felt serene. He admired his father's striking air and pse.
After all, it was a great deal t be a sn of a man who could so
gallantly hld the psition of a cynosure for three generations.

General Deffenbaugh cleared his thrat. Elmville pened its mouth,
and squirmed. The chieftain with the kindly, fateful face was
hlding ut his hand, smiling. Ex-war-Governor Pemberton extended
his wn acrss the chasm. But what was this the General was saying?

"Mr. President, allw me t present to you one who has the honour to
be the father f ur foremost, distinguished citizen, learned and
hnured jurist, beloved townsman, and model Southern gentleman--the
Hnurable William B. Pemberton."




XV

THE ENCHANTED KISS


But a clerk in the Cut-rate Drug Stre was Samuel Tansey, yet
his slender frame was a pad that enflded the passin of Romeo,
the glm of Laura, the romance of D'Artagnan, and the desperate
inspiratin f Melnotte. Pity, then, that he had been denied
expressin, that he was domed to the burden of utter timidity and
diffidence, that Fate had set him tngue-tied and scarlet befre
the muslin-clad angels whm he adred and vainly longed to rescue,
clasp, cmfrt, and subdue.

The clck's hands were pinting close upon the hour of ten while
Tansey was playing billiards with a number f his friends. n
alternate evenings he was released frm duty at the stre after
seven 'clck. Even among his fellow-men Tansey was timorous and
cnstrained. In his imaginatin he had done valiant deeds and
perfrmed acts f distinguished gallantry; but in fact he was a
sallw yuth of twenty-three, with an over-modest demeanour and
scant vcabulary.

When the clck struck ten, Tansey hastily laid dwn his cue and
struck sharply upn the shw-case with a coin for the attendant to
cme and receive the pay fr his score.

"What's yur hurry, Tansey?" called ne. "Got another engagement?"

"Tansey gt an engagement!" eched another. "Not on your life.
Tansey's gt t get home at Motten by her Peek's orders."

"It's n such thing," chimed in a pale yuth, taking a large cigar
frm his muth; "Tansey's afraid to be late because Miss Katie might
cme dwn stairs to unlock the door, and kiss him in the hall."

This delicate piece f raillery sent a fiery tingle int Tansey's
bld, for the indictment was true--barring the kiss. That was a
thing t dream f; to wildly hope for; but too remote and sacred a
thing t think f lightly.

Casting a cld and cntemptuous look at the speaker--a punishment
cmmensurate with his wn diffident spirit--Tansey left the room,
descending the stairs int the street.

Fr tw years he had silently adored Miss Peek, worshipping her from
a spiritual distance thrugh which her attractins took on stellar
brightness and mystery. Mrs. Peek kept a few chice barders, among
whm was Tansey. The ther young men romped with Katie, chased her
with crickets in their fingers, and "jllied" her with an irreverent
freedm that turned Tansey's heart int cold lead in his bosom.
The signs f his adration were few--a tremulous "Good morning,"
stealthy glances at her during meals, and ccasinally (Oh,
rapture!) a blushing, delirius game f cribbage with her in the
parlur n some rare evening when a miraculous lack of engagement
kept her at hme. Kiss him in the hall! Aye, he feared it, but it
was an ecstatic fear such as Elijah must have felt when the charit
lifted him int the unknwn.

But t-night the gibes f his associates had stung him to a feeling
f frward, lawless mutiny; a defiant, challenging, atavistic
recklessness. Spirit f crsair, adventurer, lover, poet,
bhemian, pssessed him. The stars he saw above him seemed no more
unattainable, n less high, than the favur of Miss Peek or the
fearsme sweetness f her delectable lips. His fate seemed to him
strangely dramatic and pathetic, and t call fr a solace consonant
with its extremity. A saln was near by, and to this he flitted,
calling fr absinthe--beynd doubt the drink most adequate to his
md--the tipple of the roué, the abandoned, the vainly sighing
lver.

nce he drank f it, and again, and then again until he felt a
strange, exalted sense f nn-participation in worldly affairs
pervade him. Tansey was n drinker; his cnsumption of three
absinthe anisettes within almst as few minutes prclaimed his
unprficiency in the art; Tansey was merely floding with unproven
liqur his srrows; which record and tradition alleged to be
drwnable.

Cming ut upon the sidewalk, he snapped his fingers defiantly in
the directin f the Peek homestead, turned the other way, and
vyaged, Clumbus-like into the wilds of an enchanted street. Nor is
the figure exrbitant, fr, beyond his store the foot of Tansey had
scarcely been set fr years--stre and boarding-house; between these
prts he was chartered t run, and contrary currents had rarely
deflected his prw.

Tansey aimlessly prtracted his walk, and, whether it was his
unfamiliarity with the district, his recent accessin f audacious
errantry, r the sphistical whisper of a certain green-eyed
fairy, he came at last t tread a shuttered, blank, and eching
thrughfare, dark and unpeopled. And, suddenly, this way came to an
end (as many streets d in the Spanish-built, archaic twn of San
Antne), butting its head against an imminent, high, brick wall.
N--the street still lived! T the right and to the left it breathed
thrugh slender tubes f exit--narrow, somnolent ravines, cobble
paved and unlighted. Accmmdating a rise in the street to the right
was reared a phantm flight f five luminous steps of limestone,
flanked by a wall f the same height and f the same material.

Upn ne of these steps Tansey seated himself and bethought him of
his lve, and hw she might never know she was his love. And of
Mther Peek, fat, vigilant and kind; nt unpleased, Tansey thought,
that he and Katie shuld play cribbage in the parlur together.
Fr the Cut-rate had nt cut his salary, which, sordidly speaking,
ranked him star barder at the Peek's. And he thught of Captain
Peek, Katie's father, a man he dreaded and abhrred; a genteel
lafer and spendthrift, battening upn the labour of his women-folk;
a very queer fish, and, accrding t repute, not of the freshest.

The night had turned chill and fggy. The heart f the town, with
its nises, was left behind. Reflected frm the high vapours, its
distant lights were manifest in quivering, cne-shaped streamers, in
questinable blushes f unnamed colours, in unstable, ghostly waves
f far, electric flashes. Nw that the darkness was become more
friendly, the wall against which the street splintered develped a
stne cping topped with an armature of spikes. Beyond it loomed
what appeared t be the acute angles f mountain peaks, pierced here
and there by little lambent parallelgrams. Cnsidering this vista,
Tansey at length persuaded himself that the seeming muntains were,
in fact, the cnvent f Santa Mercedes, with which ancient and
bulky pile he was better familiar frm different cigns of view. A
pleasant nte f singing in his ears reinforced his opinion. High,
sweet, hly carlling, far and harmonious and uprising, as of
sanctified nuns at their respnses. At what hur did the Sisters
sing? He tried t think--was it six, eight, twelve? Tansey leaned
his back against the limestne wall and wndered. Strange things
fllwed. The air was full of white, fluttering pigeons that circled
abut, and settled upn the convent wall. The wall blossomed with a
quantity f shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him frm
the slid masnry. A pink, classic nymph came from an excavation in
the cavernus rad and danced, barefoot and airy, upon the ragged
flints. The sky was traversed by a cmpany f beribboned cats,
marching in stupendus, aërial prcession. The noise of singing grew
luder; an illuminatin of unseasonable fireflies danced past, and
strange whispers came ut f the dark without meaning or excuse.

Withut amazement Tansey tok note of these phenomena. He was on
sme new plane f understanding, though his mind seemed to him clear
and, indeed, happily tranquil.

A desire fr mvement and exploration seized him: he rose and turned
int the black gash f street to his right. For a time the high
wall frmed ne of its boundaries; but further on, two rows of
black-windwed huses closed it in.

Here was the city's quarter nce given ver to the Spaniard. Here
were still his frbidding abdes of concrete and adobe, standing
cld and indmitable against the century. From the murky fissure,
the eye saw, flung against the sky, the tangled filigree f
his Mrish balconies. Through stone archways breaths of dead,
vault-chilled air cughed upn him; his feet struck jingling
irn rings in staples stne-buried for half a cycle. Along these
paltry avenues had swaggered the arrgant Dn, had caracoled and
serenaded and blustered while the tmahawk and the pineer's rifle
were already uplifted t expel him frm a continent. And Tansey,
stumbling thrugh this ld-world dust, looked up, dark as it was,
and saw Andalusian beauties glimmering n the balcnies. Some of
them were laughing and listening t the gblin music that still
fllwed; others harked fearfully through the night, trying to catch
the hf beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had
died away a century ag. Thse women were silent, but Tansey heard
the jangle f hrseless bridle-bits, the whirr of riderless rowels,
and, nw and then, a muttered maledictin in a foreign tongue. But
he was nt frightened. Shadws, nor shadows of sounds could daunt
him. Afraid? N. Afraid f Mother Peek? Afraid to face the girl
f his heart? Afraid f tipsy Captain Peek? Nay! nor of these
apparitins, nr of that spectral singing that always pursued him.
Singing! He wuld shw them! He lifted up a strong and untuneful
vice:


   "When yu hear them bells g tingalingling,"


serving ntice upn those mysterious agencies that if it should come
t a face-t-face encounter


   "There'll be a ht time
    In the ld twn
    T-night!"


Hw lng Tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not
clear t him, but in time he emerged int a more commodious avenue.
When within a few yards f the crner he perceived, through a
windw, that a small cnfectionary of mean appearance was set in
the angle. His same glance that estimated its meagre equipment, its
cheap sda-water funtain and stock of tobacco and sweets, took
cgnizance f Captain Peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging
gaslight.

As Tansey runded the crner Captain Peek came out, and they met
_vis-a-vis_. An exultant jy filled Tansey when he fund himself
sustaining the encunter with implicit curage. Peek, indeed! He
raised his hand, and snapped his fingers ludly.

It was Peek himself wh quailed guiltily befre the valiant mien of
the drug clerk. Sharp surprise and a palpable fear burgened upon
the Captain's face. And, verily, that face was ne t rather call up
such expressins n the faces of others. The face of a libidinous
heathen idl, small eyed, with carven flds in the heavy jowls, and
a cnsuming, pagan license in its expressin. In the gutter just
beynd the stre Tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back
tward him and a mtionless driver perched in his place.

"Why, it's Tansey!" exclaimed Captain Peek. "Hw are yu, Tansey?
H-have a cigar, Tansey?"

"Why, it's Peek!" cried Tansey, jubilant at his wn temerity.
"What deviltry are yu up t now, Peek? Back streets and a closed
carriage! Fie! Peek!"

"There's n ne in the carriage," said the Captain, smoothly.

"Everybdy ut of it is in luck," continued Tansey, aggressively.
"I'd lve fr you to know, Peek, that I'm not stuck on you. You're a
bttle-nsed scoundrel."

"Why, the little rat's drunk!" cried the Captain, jyfully; "nly
drunk, and I thught he was n! Go home, Tansey, and quit bothering
grwn persns on the street."

But just then a white-clad figure sprang ut f the carriage, and a
shrill vice--Katie's vice--sliced the air: "Sam! Sam!--help me,
Sam!"

Tansey sprung tward her, but Captain Peek interpsed his bulky
frm. Wnder of wonders! the whilom spiritless youth struck out
with his right, and the hulking Captain went ver in a swearing
heap. Tansey flew t Katie, and tok her in his arms like a
cnquering knight. She raised her face, and he kissed her--vilets!
electricity! caramels! champagne! Here was the attainment f a dream
that brught n disenchantment.

"h, Sam," cried Katie, when she culd, "I knew you would come to
rescue me. What d yu suppose the mean things were going to do with
me?"

"Have yur picture taken," said Tansey, wndering at the foolishness
f his remark.

"N, they were ging to eat me. I heard them talking about it."

"Eat yu!" said Tansey, after pndering a moment. "That can't be;
there's n plates."

But a sudden nise warned him t turn. Down upon him were bearing
the Captain and a mnstrus long-bearded dwarf in a spangled cloak
and red trunk-hse. The dwarf leaped twenty feet and clutched them.
The Captain seized Katie and hurled her, shrieking, back int the
carriage, himself fllwed, and the vehicle dashed away. The dwarf
lifted Tansey high abve his head and ran with him int the store.
Hlding him with ne hand, he raised the lid of an enormous chest
half filled with cakes f ice, flung Tansey inside, and clsed down
the cver.

The frce f the fall must have been great, for Tansey lost
cnsciusness. When his faculties revived his first sensation was
ne f severe cold along his back and limbs. Opening his eyes, he
fund himself t be seated upon the limestone steps still facing the
wall and cnvent f Santa Mercedes. His first thought was of the
ecstatic kiss frm Katie. The utrageous villainy of Captain Peek,
the unnatural mystery f the situatin, his preposterous conflict
with the imprbable dwarf--these things rused and angered him, but
left n impressin of the unreal.

"I'll g back there t-morrow," he grumbled aloud, "and knock the
head ff that cmic-opera squab. Running out and picking up perfect
strangers, and shving them int cold storage!"

But the kiss remained uppermst in his mind. "I might have dne that
lng ag," he mused. "She liked it, too. She called me 'Sam' four
times. I'll nt g up that street again. Too much scrapping. Guess
I'll mve dwn the other way. Wonder what she meant by saying they
were ging t eat her!"

Tansey began t feel sleepy, but after a while he decided t move
alng again. This time he ventured int the street to his left. It
ran level fr a distance, and then dipped gently dwnward, opening
int a vast, dim, barren space--the ld Military Plaza. To his left,
sme hundred yards distant, he saw a cluster f flickering lights
alng the Plaza's brder. He knew the locality at once.

Huddled within narrw cnfines were the remnants of the once-famous
purveyrs f the celebrated Mexican national cookery. A few years
befre, their nightly encampments upn the historic Alamo Plaza, in
the heart f the city, had been a carnival, a saturnalia that was
renwned thrughout the land. Then the caterers numbered hundreds;
the patrns thusands. Drawn by the coquettish _señoritas_, the
music f the weird Spanish minstrels, and the strange piquant
Mexican dishes served at a hundred cmpeting tables, crwds thronged
the Alam Plaza all night. Travellers, ranchers, family parties,
gay gascnading runders, sightseers and prowlers of polyglot,
wlish San Antne mingled there at the centre of the city's fun and
frlic. The ppping of corks, pistols, and questions; the glitter of
eyes, jewels and daggers; the ring f laughter and cin--these were
the rder f the night.

But nw n longer. To some half-dozen tents, fires, and tables had
dwindled the picturesque festival, and these had been relegated t
an ancient disused plaza.

ften had Tansey strlled down to these stands at night to partake
f the delectable _chili-cn-carne_, a dish evolved by the genius of
Mexic, cmposed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and
the pignant _chili clorado_--a compound full of singular flavour
and a fiery zest delightful t the Suthron's palate.

The titillating dur of this concoction came now, on the breeze, to
the nstrils f Tansey, awakening in him hunger for it. As he turned
in that directin he saw a carriage dash up t the Mexicans' tents
ut f the gloom of the Plaza. Some figures moved back and forward
in the uncertain light f the lanterns, and then the carriage was
driven swiftly away.

Tansey apprached, and sat at ne of the tables covered with gaudy
il-clth. Traffic was dull at the moment. A few half-grown boys
nisily fared at anther table; the Mexicans hung listless and
phlegmatic abut their wares. And it was still. The night hum f the
city crwded t the wall of dark buildings surrounding the Plaza,
and subsided t an indefinite buzz thrugh which sharply perforated
the crackle f the languid fires and the rattle f fork and spoon.
A sedative wind blew frm the sutheast. The starless firmament
pressed dwn upn the earth like a leaden cover.

In all that quiet Tansey turned his head suddenly, and saw, withut
disquietude, a trp of spectral horsemen deploy into the Plaza and
charge a luminus line f infantry that advanced to sustain the
shck. He saw the fierce flame f cannon and small arms, but heard
n sund. The careless victuallers lounged vacantly, not deigning to
view the cnflict. Tansey mildly wndered to what nations these mute
cmbatants might belng; turned his back to them and ordered his
chili and cffee frm the Mexican woman who advanced to serve him.
This wman was ld and careworn; her face was lined like the rind
f a cantalupe. She fetched the viands from a vessel set by the
smuldering fire, and then retired t a tent, dark within, that
std near by.

Presently Tansey heard a turmil in the tent; a wailing,
brken-hearted pleading in the harmnious Spanish tongue, and then
tw figures tumbled ut into the light of the lanterns. One was the
ld wman; the other was a man clothed with a sumptuous and flashing
splendur. The wman seemed to clutch and beseech from him something
against his will. The man brke frm her and struck her brutally
back int the tent, where she lay, whimpering and invisible.
bserving Tansey, he walked rapidly t the table where he sat.
Tansey recgnized him t be Ramon Torres, a Mexican, the proprietor
f the stand he was patrnizing.

Trres was a handsme, nearly full-blooded descendant of the
Spanish, seemingly abut thirty years f age, and of a haughty, but
extremely curteus demeanour. To-night he was dressed with signal
magnificence. His cstume was that f a triumphant _matador_, made
f purple velvet almst hidden by jeweled embroidery. Diamonds of
enrmus size flashed upon his garb and his hands. He reached for a
chair, and, seating himself at the ppsite side of the table, began
t rll a finical cigarette.

"Ah, Meester Tansee," he said, with a sultry fire in his silky,
black eyes, "I give myself pleasure t see yu this evening. Meester
Tansee, yu have many times cme to eat at my table. I theenk you a
safe man--a verree gd friend. How much would it please you to
leeve frever?"

"Nt cme back any more?" inquired Tansey.

"N; nt leave--_leeve_; the not-to-die."

"I wuld call that," said Tansey, "a snap."

Trres leaned his elbws upon the table, swallowed a mouthful of
smke, and spake--each wrd being projected in a little puff of
gray.

"Hw ld do you theenk I am, Meester Tansee?"

"h, twenty-eight r thirty."

"Thees day," said the Mexican, "ees my birthday. I am fur hundred
and three years f ld to-day."

"Anther prof," said Tansey, airily, "of the healthfulness of our
climate."

"Eet is nt the air. I am t relate to you a secret of verree fine
value. Listen me, Meester Tansee. At the age f twenty-three I
arrive in Mexic frm Spain. When? In the year fifteen hundred
nineteen, with the _sldads_ of Hernando Cortez. I come to thees
cuntry seventeen fifteen. I saw yur Alamo reduced. It was like
yesterday t me. Three hundred ninety-six year ag I learn the
secret always t leeve. Lok at these clothes I war--at these
_diamantes_. D yu theenk I buy them with the money I make with
selling the _chili-cn-carne_, Meester Tansee?"

"I shuld think nt," said Tansey, promptly. Torres laughed loudly.

"_Valgame Dis!_ but I d. But it not the kind you eating now. I
make a deeferent kind, the eating f which makes men t always
leeve. What d yu think! One thousand people I supply--_diez pesos_
each ne pays me the mnth. You see! ten thousand _pesos_ everee
mnth! _Que diable!_ hw not I wear the fine _ropa_! You see that
ld wman try to hold me back a little while ago? That ees my wife.
When I marry her she is yung--seventeen year--_bnita_. Like
the rest she ees becme ld and--what you say!--tough? I am the
same--yung all the time. T-night I resolve to dress myself
and find anther wife befitting my age. This ld woman try to
scr-r-ratch my face. Ha! ha! Meester Tansee--same way they d
_entre ls Americans_."

"And this health-fd you spoke of?" said Tansey.

"Hear me," said Trres, leaning ver the table until he lay flat
upn it; "eet is the _chili-cn-carne_ made not from the beef or the
chicken, but frm the flesh f the _señorita_--young and tender.
That ees the secret. Everee mnth yu must eat of it, having care to
d s before the moon is full, and you will not die any times. See
hw I trust yu, friend Tansee! To-night I have bought one young
ladee--verree pretty--s _fina, grda, blandita!_ To-morrow the
_chili_ will be ready. _Ahra si!_ ne thousand dollars I pay for
thees yung ladee. Frm an _Americano_ I have bought--a verree
tip-tp man--_el Capitan Peek_--_que es, Señr?_"

Fr Tansey had sprung t his feet, upsetting the chair. The words
f Katie reverberated in his ears: "They're ging to eat me, Sam."
This, then, was the mnstrus fate to which she had been delivered
by her unnatural parent. The carriage he had seen drive up frm the
Plaza was Captain Peek's. Where was Katie? Perhaps already--

Befre he culd decide what to do a loud scream came from the tent.
The ld Mexican wman ran out, a flashing knife in her hand. "I have
released her," she cried. "Yu shall kill n more. They will hang
yu--_ingrat_--_encatador!_"

Trres, with a hissing exclamatin, sprang at her.

"Ramncit!" she shrieked; "once you loved me."

The Mexican's arm raised and descended. "Yu are ld," he cried; and
she fell and lay mtinless.

Anther scream; the flaps f the tent were flung aside, and there
std Katie, white with fear, her wrists still bound with a cruel
crd.

"Sam!" she cried, "save me again!"

Tansey runded the table, and flung himself, with superb nerve, upn
the Mexican. Just then a clangur began; the clcks of the city were
tlling the midnight hur. Tansey clutched at Torres, and, for a
mment, felt in his grasp the crunch f velvet and the cold facets
f the glittering gems. The next instant, the bedecked caballer
turned in his hands t a shrunken, leather-visaged, white-bearded,
ld, ld, screaming mummy, sandalled, ragged, and four hundred and
three. The Mexican wman was crawling t her feet, and laughing. She
shk her brown hand in the face of the whining _viejo_.

"G, nw," she cried, "and seek your señorita. It was I, Ramoncito,
wh brught you to this. Within each moon you eat of the life-giving
_chili_. It was I that kept the wrng time fr you. You should have
eaten _yesterday_ instead f _t-morrow_. It is too late. Off with
yu, _hmbre_! You are too old for me!"

"This," decided Tansey, releasing his hld f the gray-beard, "is a
private family matter cncerning age, and n business of mine."

With ne f the table knives he hastened to saw asunder the fetters
f the fair captive; and then, fr the second time that night he
kissed Katie Peek--tasted again the sweetness, the wnder, the
thrill f it, attained nce more the maximum of his incessant
dreams.

The next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shulders;
he felt his bld slowly congeal; heard the senile cackle of the
perennial Spaniard; saw the Plaza rise and reel till the zenith
crashed int the hrizon--and knew no more.

When Tansey pened his eyes again he was sitting upn those
self-same steps gazing upn the dark bulk f the sleeping convent.
In the middle f his back was still the acute, chilling pain. Hw
had he been cnveyed back there again? He gt stiffly to his feet
and stretched his cramped limbs. Supprting himself against the
stnewrk he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that
had befallen him each time he had strayed frm the steps that night.
In reviewing them certain features strained his credulity. Had he
really met Captain Peek r Katie r the unparalleled Mexican in
his wanderings--had he really encuntered them under cmmonplace
cnditins and his over-stimulated brain had supplied the
incngruities? Hwever that might be, a sudden, elating thought
caused him an intense jy. Nearly all f us have, at some point in
ur lives--either t excuse our own stupidity or to placate our
cnsciences--prmulgated some theory of fatalism. We have set up
an intelligent Fate that wrks by cdes and signals. Tansey had
dne likewise; and nw he read, through the night's incidents, the
finger-prints f destiny. Each excursin that he had made had led
t the ne paramount finale--to Katie and that kiss, which survived
and grew strng and intxicating in his memory. Clearly, Fate was
hlding up t him the mirror that night, calling him to observe
what awaited him at the end f whichever rad he might take. He
immediately turned, and hurried hmeward.



Clthed in an elabrate, pale blue wrapper, cut to fit, Miss Katie
Peek reclined in an armchair befre a waning fire in her rom. Her
little, bare feet were thrust int huse-shoes rimmed with swan's
dwn. By the light f a small lamp she was attacking the society
news f the latest Sunday paper. Sme happy substance, seemingly
indestructible, was being rhythmically crushed between her small
white teeth. Miss Katie read f functins and furbelows, but she
kept a vigilant ear fr utside sounds and a frequent eye upon the
clck ver the mantel. At every footstep upon the asphalt sidewalk
her smth, round chin would cease for a moment its regular rise and
fall, and a frwn f listening would pucker her pretty brows.

At last she heard the latch f the irn gate click. She sprang
up, tripped sftly t the mirror, where she made a few of those
feminine, flickering passes at her frnt hair and thrat which are
warranted t hypntize the approaching guest.

The dr-bell rang. Miss Katie, in her haste, turned the blaze of
the lamp lwer instead f higher, and hastened noiselessly down
stairs int the hall. She turned the key, the dor opened, and Mr.
Tansey side-stepped in.

"Why, the i-de-a!" exclaimed Miss Katie, "is this yu, Mr. Tansey?
It's after midnight. Aren't yu ashamed t wake me up at such an
hur t let you in? You're just _awful_!"

"I was late," said Tansey, brilliantly.

"I shuld think yu were! Ma was awfully worried about you. When you
weren't in by ten, that hateful Tm McGill said yu were out calling
n anther--said you were out calling on some young lady. I just
despise Mr. McGill. Well, I'm nt ging to scold you any more, Mr.
Tansey, if it _is_ a little late--h! I turned it the wrng way!"

Miss Katie gave a little scream. Absent-mindedly she had turned the
blaze f the lamp entirely ut instead of higher. It was very dark.

Tansey heard a musical, sft giggle, and breathed an entrancing
dur of heliotrope. A groping light hand touched his arm.

"Hw awkward I was! Can yu find your way--Sam?"

"I--I think I have a match, Miss K-Katie."

A scratching sund; a flame; a glw of light held at arm's length by
the recreant fllwer of Destiny illuminating a tableau which shall
end the ignminius chronicle--a maid with unkissed, curling,
cntemptuus lips slowly lifting the lamp chimney and allowing the
wick t ignite; then waving a scrnful and abjuring hand toward the
staircase--the unhappy Tansey, erstwhile champin in the prphetic
lists f frtune, ingloriously ascending to his just and certain
dm, while (let us imagine) half within the wings stands the
imminent figure f Fate jerking wildly at the wrng strings, and
mixing things up in her usual able manner.

A DEPARTMENTAL CASE


In Texas yu may travel a thusand miles in a straight line. If
yur curse is a crooked one, it is likely that both the distance
and yur rate f speed may be vastly increased. Clouds there
sail serenely against the wind. The whip-pr-will delivers its
discnslate cry with the notes exactly reversed from those of his
Nrthern brther. Given a drought and a subsequently lively rain,
and l! frm a glazed and stony soil will spring in a single night
blssmed lilies, miraculously fair. Tom Green County was once the
standard f measurement. I have frgotten how many New Jerseys and
Rhde Islands it was that culd have been stowed away and lost in
its chaparral. But the legislative axe has slashed Tm Green int
a handful f cunties hardly larger than European kingdoms. The
legislature cnvenes at Austin, near the centre f the state; and,
while the representative frm the Ri Grande country is gathering
his palm-leaf fan and his linen duster t set ut for the capital,
the Pan-handle sln winds his muffler above his well-buttoned
vercat and kicks the snow from his well-greased boots ready for
the same jurney. All this merely t hint that the big ex-republic
f the Suthwest forms a sizable star on the flag, and to prepare
fr the crollary that things sometimes happen there uncut to
pattern and unfettered by metes and bunds.

The Cmmissiner of Insurance, Statistics, and History of the State
f Texas was an fficial of no very great or very small importance.
The past tense is used, fr nw he is Commissioner of Insurance
alne. Statistics and histry are no longer proper nouns in the
gvernment recrds.

In the year 188--, the gvernr appointed Luke Coonrod Standifer to
be the head f this department. Standifer was then fifty-five years
f age, and a Texan t the core. His father had been one of the
state's earliest settlers and pineers. Standifer himself had served
the cmmnwealth as Indian fighter, soldier, ranger, and legislator.
Much learning he did nt claim, but he had drank pretty deep f the
spring f experience.

If ther grunds were less abundant, Texas should be well up in the
lists f glry as the grateful republic. For both as republic and
state, it has busily heaped hnurs and solid rewards upon its sons
wh rescued it frm the wilderness.

Wherefre and therefre, Luke Coonrod Standifer, son of Ezra
Standifer, ex-Terry ranger, simn-pure demcrat, and lucky dweller
in an unrepresented prtin of the politico-geographical map, was
appinted Cmmissioner of Insurance, Statistics, and History.

Standifer accepted the hnur with some doubt as to the nature of
the ffice he was t fill and his capacity for filling it--but
he accepted, and by wire. He immediately set ut frm the little
cuntry twn where he maintained (and was scarcely maintained by) a
smnlent and unfruitful office of surveying and map-drawing. Before
departing, he had lked up under the I's, S's and H's in the
"Encyclpædia Britannica" what infrmation and preparation toward
his fficial duties that thse weighty volumes afforded.

A few weeks f incumbency diminished the new cmmissioner's awe of
the great and imprtant ffice he had been called upon to conduct.
An increasing familiarity with its wrkings son restored him to
his accustmed placid curse of life. In his office was an old,
spectacled clerk--a cnsecrated, infrmed, able machine, who
held his desk regardless f changes f administrative heads. Old
Kauffman instructed his new chief gradually in the knwledge f the
department withut seeming t do so, and kept the wheels revolving
withut the slip f a cog.

Indeed, the Department f Insurance, Statistics, and Histry
carried n great heft f the burden of state. Its main work was
the regulating f the business dne in the state by foreign
insurance cmpanies, and the letter f the law was its guide. As
fr statistics--well, yu wrote letters to county officers, and
scissred ther people's reports, and each year you got out a report
f yur own about the corn crop and the cotton crop and pecans and
pigs and black and white ppulatin, and a great many columns of
figures headed "bushels" and "acres" and "square miles," etc.--and
there yu were. Histry? The branch was purely a receptive one. Old
ladies interested in the science bthered yu some with long reports
f prceedings of their historical societies. Some twenty or thirty
peple wuld write you each year that they had secured Sam Houston's
pcket-knife r Santa Ana's whisky-flask or Davy Crockett's
rifle--all abslutely authenticated--and demanded legislative
apprpriatin to purchase. Most of the work in the history branch
went int pigen-holes.

ne sizzling August afternon the commissioner reclined in his
ffice chair, with his feet upn the long, official table covered
with green billiard clth. The cmmissioner was smoking a cigar, and
dreamily regarding the quivering landscape framed by the windw that
lked upon the treeless capitol grounds. Perhaps he was thinking of
the rugh and ready life he had led, f the old days of breathless
adventure and mvement, f the comrades who now trod other paths or
had ceased t tread any, f the changes civilization and peace had
brught, and, maybe, cmplacently, of the snug and comfortable camp
pitched fr him under the dme of the capitol of the state that had
nt frgotten his services.

The business f the department was lax. Insurance was easy.
Statistics were nt in demand. Histry was dead. Old Kauffman,
the efficient and perpetual clerk, had requested an infrequent
half-hliday, incited t the unusual dissipation by the joy of
having successfully twisted the tail f a Cnnecticut insurance
cmpany that was trying t do business contrary to the edicts of the
great Lne Star State.

The ffice was very still. A few subdued nises trickled in through
the pen dor from the other departments--a dull tinkling crash from
the treasurer's ffice adjining, as a clerk tossed a bag of silver
t the flor of the vault--the vague, intermittent clatter of a
dilatry typewriter--a dull tapping frm the state geologist's
quarters as if sme wodpecker had flown in to bore for his prey in
the cl of the massive building--and then a faint rustle and the
light shuffling f the well-wrn shoes along the hall, the sounds
ceasing at the dr toward which the commissioner's lethargic back
was presented. Fllwing this, the sound of a gentle voice speaking
wrds unintelligible t the commissioner's somewhat dormant
cmprehensin, but giving evidence of bewilderment and hesitation.

The vice was feminine; the cmmissioner was of the race of
cavaliers wh make salaam befre the trail of a skirt without
cnsidering the quality f its cloth.

There std in the door a faded woman, one of the numerous
sisterhd of the unhappy. She was dressed all in black--poverty's
perpetual murning fr lost joys. Her face had the contours of
twenty and the lines f frty. She may have lived that intervening
scre f years in a twelve-month. There was about her yet an aurum
f indignant, unappeased, prtesting youth that shone faintly
thrugh the premature veil f unearned decline.

"I beg yur pardn, ma'am," said the commissioner, gaining his feet
t the accmpaniment of a great creaking and sliding of his chair.

"Are yu the gvernor, sir?" asked the vision of melancholy.

The cmmissiner hesitated at the end of his best bow, with his
hand in the bsm of his double-breasted "frock." Truth at last
cnquered.

"Well, n, ma'am. I am nt the governor. I have the honour to be
Cmmissiner of Insurance, Statistics, and History. Is there
anything, ma'am, I can d fr you? Won't you have a chair, ma'am?"

The lady subsided int the chair handed her, prbably from purely
physical reasns. She wielded a cheap fan--last tken of gentility
t be abandned. Her clothing seemed to indicate a reduction almost
t extreme pverty. She looked at the man who was not the governor,
and saw kindliness and simplicity and a rugged, unadrned
curtliness emanating frm a countenance tanned and toughened by
frty years f outdoor life. Also, she saw that his eyes were clear
and strng and blue. Just s they had been when he used them to skim
the hrizn for raiding Kiowas and Sioux. His mouth was as set and
firm as it had been n that day when he bearded the ld Lion Sam
Hustn himself, and defied him during that season when secession
was the theme. Nw, in bearing and dress, Luke Conrod Sandifer
endeavured t do credit to the important arts and sciences of
Insurance, Statistics, and Histry. He had abandned the careless
dress f his cuntry home. Now, his broad-brimmed black slouch hat,
and his lng-tailed "frck" made him not the least imposing of the
fficial family, even if his ffice was reckoned to stand at the
tail f the list.

"Yu wanted t see the governor, ma'am?" asked the commissioner,
with a deferential manner he always used tward the fair sex.

"I hardly knw," said the lady, hesitatingly. "I suppse so." And
then, suddenly drawn by the sympathetic lk of the other, she
pured frth the story of her need.

It was a stry s common that the public has come to look at its
mntony instead of its pity. The old tale of an unhappy married
life--made s by a brutal, cnscienceless husband, a robber, a
spendthrift, a mral cward and a bully, who failed to provide
even the means f the barest existence. Yes, he had cme down
in the scale s lw as to strike her. It happened only the day
befre--there was the bruise n one temple--she had offended his
highness by asking fr a little mney to live on. And yet she must
needs, wman-like, append a plea fr her tyrant--he was drinking;
he had rarely abused her thus when sber.

"I thught," murned this pale sister of sorrow, "that maybe the
state might be willing t give me sme relief. I've heard of such
things being dne fr the families of old settlers. I've heard
tell that the state used t give land t the men who fought for it
against Mexic, and settled up the cuntry, and helped drive out the
Indians. My father did all f that, and he never received anything.
He never wuld take it. I thught the governor would be the one to
see, and that's why I came. If father was entitled t anything, they
might let it cme t me."

"It's pssible, ma'am," said Standifer, "that such might be the
case. But 'mst all the veterans and settlers gt their land
certificates issued, and lcated lng ago. Still, we can look that
up in the land ffice, and be sure. Yur father's name, now, was--"

"Ams Clvin, sir."

"Gd Lord!" exclaimed Standifer, rising and unbuttoning his tight
cat, excitedly. "Are yu Amos Colvin's daughter? Why, ma'am, Amos
Clvin and me were thicker than tw hoss thieves for more than ten
years! We fught Kiwas, drove cattle, and rangered side by side
nearly all ver Texas. I remember seeing yu once before, now. You
were a kid, abut seven, a-riding a little yellw pony up and down.
Ams and me stpped at your home for a little grub when we were
trailing that band f Mexican cattle thieves dwn through Karnes
and Bee. Great tarantulas! and yu're Ams Colvin's little girl!
Did yu ever hear yur father mention Luke Standifer--just kind of
casually--as if he'd met me nce r twice?"

A little pale smile flitted acrss the lady's white face.

"It seems t me," she said, "that I dn't remember hearing him talk
abut much else. Every day there was sme story he had to tell
abut what he and yu had done. Mighty near the last thing I heard
him tell was abut the time when the Indians wunded him, and you
crawled ut t him through the grass, with a canteen of water, while
they--"

"Yes, yes--well--h, that wasn't anything," said Standifer,
"hemming" ludly and buttning his coat again, briskly. "And now,
ma'am, wh was the infernal skunk--I beg yur pardon, ma'am--who was
the gentleman yu married?"

"Bentn Sharp."

The cmmissiner plumped down again into his chair, with a groan.
This gentle, sad little wman, in the rusty black gwn, the daughter
f his ldest friend, the wife of Benton Sharp! Benton Sharp, one of
the mst nted "bad" men in that part of the state--a man who had
been a cattle thief, an utlaw, a desperad, and was now a gambler,
a swaggering bully, wh plied his trade in the larger frntier
twns, relying upn his record and the quickness of his gun play to
maintain his supremacy. Seldm did any ne take the risk of going
"up against" Bentn Sharp. Even the law fficers were content to let
him make his wn terms f peace. Sharp was a ready and an accurate
sht, and as lucky as a brand-new penny at cming clear from his
scrapes. Standifer wndered hw this pillaging eagle ever came to be
mated with Ams Clvin's little dove, and expressed his wonder.

Mrs. Sharp sighed.

"Yu see, Mr. Standifer, we didn't knw anything about him, and he
can be very pleasant and kind when he wants t. We lived dwn in the
little twn f Goliad. Benton came riding down that way, and stopped
there a while. I reckn I was sme better looking then than I am
nw. He was god to me for a whole year after we were married. He
insured his life fr me fr five thousand dollars. But for the last
six mnths he has dne everything but kill me. I often wish he had
dne that, to. He got out of money for a while, and abused me
shamefully fr nt having anything he could spend. Then father died,
and left me the little hme in Gliad. My husband made me sell that,
and turned me ut int the world. I've barely been able to live, for
I'm nt strng enough to work. Lately, I heard he was making money
in San Antni, so I went there, and found him, and asked for a
little help. This," tuching the livid bruise n her temple, "is
what he gave me. S I came n to Austin to see the governor. I once
heard father say that there was sme land, r a pension, coming to
him frm the state that he never wuld ask for."

Luke Standifer rse t his feet, and pushed his chair back. He
lked rather perplexedly around the big office, with its handsome
furniture.

"It's a lng trail t follow," he said, slowly, "trying to get back
dues frm the gvernment. There's red tape and lawyers and rulings
and evidence and curts t keep you waiting. I'm not certain,"
cntinued the cmmissioner, with a profoundly meditative frown,
"whether this department that I'm the bss f has any jurisdiction
r nt. It's only Insurance, Statistics, and History, ma'am, and it
dn't sund as if it would cover the case. But sometimes a saddle
blanket can be made t stretch. Yu keep your seat, just for a few
minutes, ma'am, till I step int the next rom and see about it."

The state treasurer was seated within his massive, cmplicated
railings, reading a newspaper. Business fr the day was abut over.
The clerks llled at their desks, awaiting the clsing hour. The
Cmmissiner of Insurance, Statistics, and History entered, and
leaned in at the windw.

The treasurer, a little, brisk ld man, with snw-white moustache
and beard, jumped up yuthfully and came frward to greet Standifer.
They were friends f ld.

"Uncle Frank," said the cmmissiner, using the familiar name by
which the histric treasurer was addressed by every Texan, "hw much
mney have yu got on hand?"

The treasurer named the sum f the last balance dwn to the odd
cents--smething mre than a million dollars.

The cmmissiner whistled lowly, and his eyes grew hopefully bright.

"Yu knw, or else you've heard of, Amos Colvin, Uncle Frank?"

"Knew him well," said the treasurer, prmptly. "A god man. A
valuable citizen. ne f the first settlers in the Southwest."

"His daughter," said Standifer, "is sitting in my ffice. She's
penniless. She's married t Bentn Sharp, a coyote and a murderer.
He's reduced her t want, and brken her heart. Her father helped
build up this state, and it's the state's turn t help his child. A
cuple f thousand dollars will buy back her home and let her live
in peace. The State f Texas can't affrd to refuse it. Give me the
mney, Uncle Frank, and I'll give it t her right away. We'll fix up
the red-tape business afterward."

The treasurer lked a little bewildered.

"Why, Standifer," he said, "yu knw I can't pay a cent out of the
treasury withut a warrant frm the comptroller. I can't disburse a
dllar withut a voucher to show for it."

The cmmissiner betrayed a slight impatience.

"I'll give yu a vucher," he declared. "What's this job they've
given me fr? Am I just a knt on a mesquite stump? Can't my office
stand fr it? Charge it up t Insurance and the other two sideshows.
Dn't Statistics shw that Amos Colvin came to this state when it
was in the hands f Greasers and rattlesnakes and Cmanches, and
fught day and night t make a white man's country of it? Don't they
shw that Ams Colvin's daughter is brought to ruin by a villain
wh's trying t pull down what you and I and old Texans shed our
bld to build up? Don't History show that the Lone Star State never
yet failed t grant relief t the suffering and oppressed children
f the men wh made her the grandest commonwealth in the Union? If
Statistics and Histry dn't bear out the claim of Amos Colvin's
child I'll ask the next legislature t ablish my office. Come,
nw, Uncle Frank, let her have the mney. I'll sign the papers
fficially, if yu say so; and then if the governor or the
cmptrller or the janitor or anybody else makes a kick, by the Lord
I'll refer the matter t the peple, and see if they won't endorse
the act."

The treasurer lked sympathetic but shocked. The commissioner's
vice had grwn louder as he rounded off the sentences that, however
praisewrthy they might be in sentiment, reflected smewhat upon
the capacity f the head f a more or less important department of
state. The clerks were beginning t listen.

"Nw, Standifer," said the treasurer, sothingly, "you know I'd like
t help in this matter, but stp and think a moment, please. Every
cent in the treasury is expended nly by apprpriation made by the
legislature, and drawn ut by checks issued by the cmptroller.
I can't cntrl the use of a cent of it. Neither can you. Your
department isn't disbursive--it isn't even administrative--it's
purely clerical. The nly way fr the lady to obtain relief is to
petitin the legislature, and--"

"T the devil with the legislature," said Standifer, turning away.

The treasurer called him back.

"I'd be glad, Standifer, t cntribute a hundred dollars personally
tward the immediate expenses f Colvin's daughter." He reached for
his pcketbok.

"Never mind, Uncle Frank," said the cmmissiner, in a softer tone.
"There's n need f that. She hasn't asked for anything of that sort
yet. Besides, her case is in my hands. I see nw what a little,
rag-tag, bb-tail, gtch-eared department I've been put in charge
f. It seems t be about as important as an almanac or a hotel
register. But while I'm running it, it wn't turn away any daughters
f Ams Colvin without stretching its jurisdiction to cover, if
pssible. Yu want to keep your eye on the Department of Insurance,
Statistics, and Histry."

The cmmissiner returned to his office, looking thoughtful. He
pened and clsed an inkstand on his desk many times with extreme
and undue attentin. "Why dn't you get a divorce?" he asked,
suddenly.

"I haven't the mney t pay for it," answered the lady.

"Just at present," annunced the cmmissioner, in a formal
tne, "the pwers of my department appear to be considerably
string-halted. Statistics seem t be verdrawn at the bank, and
Histry isn't god for a square meal. But you've come to the right
place, ma'am. The department will see yu thrugh. Where did you say
yur husband is, ma'am?"

"He was in San Antni yesterday. He is living there now."

Suddenly the cmmissiner abandoned his official air. He took the
faded little wman's hands in his, and spke in the old voice he
used n the trail and arund campfires.

"Yur name's Amanda, isn't it?"

"Yes, sir."

"I thught s. I've heard your dad say it often enough. Well,
Amanda, here's yur father's best friend, the head f a big office
in the state gvernment, that's ging to help you out of your
trubles. And here's the ld bushwhacker and cowpuncher that your
father has helped ut f scrapes time and time again wants to ask
yu a questin. Amanda, have you got money enough to run you for the
next tw r three days?"

Mrs. Sharp's white face flushed the least bit.

"Plenty, sir--fr a few days."

"All right, then, ma'am. Nw yu go back where you are stopping
here, and yu cme to the office again the day after to-morrow at
fur 'clock in the afternoon. Very likely by that time there will
be smething definite t report to you." The commissioner hesitated,
and lked a trifle embarrassed. "You said your husband had insured
his life fr $5,000. D you know whether the premiums have been kept
paid upn it r not?"

"He paid fr a whle year in advance about five months ago," said
Mrs. Sharp. "I have the plicy and receipts in my trunk."

"h, that's all right, then," said Standifer. "It's best t look
after things f that srt. Some day they may come in handy."

Mrs. Sharp departed, and sn afterward Luke Standifer went down
t the little htel where he boarded and looked up the railroad
time-table in the daily paper. Half an hur later he remved his
cat and vest, and strapped a peculiarly cnstructed pistol holster
acrss his shulders, leaving the receptacle close under his left
armpit. Int the hlster he shoved a short-barrelled .44 calibre
revlver. Putting n his clothes again, he strolled to the station
and caught the five-twenty afternn train for San Antonio.

The San Antni _Express_ of the following morning contained this
sensatinal piece f news:


   BENTN SHARP MEETS HIS MATCH

   THE MST NTED DESPERADO IN SOUTHWEST TEXAS SHOT TO
   DEATH IN THE GLD FRNT RESTAURANT--PROMINENT STATE
   FFICIAL SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDS HIMSELF AGAINST THE
   NTED BULLY--MAGNIFICENT EXHIBITIN OF QUICK GUN PLAY.

   Last night abut eleven 'clock Benton Sharp, with two
   ther men, entered the Gld Front Restaurant and seated
   themselves at a table. Sharp had been drinking, and was
   lud and bisterous, as he always was when under the
   influence f liqur. Five minutes after the party was
   seated a tall, well-dressed, elderly gentleman entered
   the restaurant. Few present recgnized the Hnourable
   Luke Standifer, the recently appinted Cmmissioner of
   Insurance, Statistics, and Histry.

   Ging ver to the same side where Sharp was, Mr.
   Standifer prepared t take a seat at the next table. In
   hanging his hat upn ne of the hooks along the wall he
   let it fall upn Sharp's head. Sharp turned, being in an
   especially ugly humur, and cursed the ther roundly.
   Mr. Standifer aplgized calmly for the accident, but
   Sharp cntinued his vituperatins. Mr. Standifer was
   bserved t draw near and speak a few sentences to the
   desperad in s low a tone that no one else caught the
   wrds. Sharp sprang up, wild with rage. In the meantime
   Standifer had stepped sme yards away, and was standing
   quietly with his arms flded acrss the breast of his
   lsely hanging coat.

   With that impetuus and deadly rapidity that made Sharp
   s dreaded, he reached fr the gun he always carried in
   his hip pcket--a mvement that has preceded the death
   f at least a dzen men at his hands. Quick as the motion
   was, the bystanders assert that it was met by the mst
   beautiful exhibitin f lightning gun-pulling ever
   witnessed in the Suthwest. As Sharp's pistl was being
   raised--and the act was really quicker than the eye culd
   fllw--a glittering .44 appeared as if by some conjuring
   trick in the right hand f Mr. Standifer, wh, without
   a perceptible mvement f his arm, shot Benton Sharp
   thrugh the heart. It seems that the new Cmmissioner of
   Insurance, Statistics, and Histry has been an ld-time
   Indian fighter and ranger fr many years, which accunts
   fr the happy knack he has f handling a .44.

   It is nt believed that Mr. Standifer will be put t any
   incnvenience beynd a necessary formal hearing to-day,
   as all the witnesses wh were present unite in declaring
   that the deed was dne in self-defence.


When Mrs. Sharp appeared at the ffice f the commissioner,
accrding t appointment, she found that gentleman calmly eating
a glden russet apple. He greeted her withut embarrassment and
withut hesitatin at approaching the subject that was the topic
f the day.

"I had t d it, ma'am," he said, simply, "or get it myself. Mr.
Kauffman," he added, turning t the ld clerk, "please look up the
recrds f the Security Life Insurance Company and see if they are
all right."

"N need t look," grunted Kauffman, who had everything in his head.
"It's all .K. They pay all lsses within ten days."

Mrs. Sharp sn rose to depart. She had arranged to remain in town
until the plicy was paid. The cmmissioner did not detain her. She
was a wman, and he did nt know just what to say to her at present.
Rest and time wuld bring her what she needed.

But, as she was leaving, Luke Standifer indulged himself in an
fficial remark:

"The Department f Insurance, Statistics, and Histry, ma'am, has
dne the best it culd with your case. 'Twas a case hard to cover
accrding t red tape. Statistics failed, and History missed fire,
but, if I may be permitted t say it, we came ut particularly
strng n Insurance."




XVII

THE RENAISSANCE AT CHARLERI


Grandemnt Charles was a little Crele gentleman, aged thirty-four,
with a bald spt n the top of his head and the manners of a prince.
By day he was a clerk in a cttn broker's office in one of those
cld, rancid muntains of oozy brick, down near the levee in New
rleans. By night, in his three-stry-high _chambre garnier_ in the
ld French Quarter he was again the last male descendant f the
Charles family, that nble huse that had lorded it in France, and
had pushed its way smiling, rapiered, and curtly int Louisiana's
early and brilliant days. f late years the Charleses had subsided
int the mre republican but scarcely less royally carried
magnificence and ease f plantatin life along the Mississippi.
Perhaps Grandemnt was even Marquis de Brassé. There was that title
in the family. But a Marquis n seventy-five dllars per month!
_Vraiment!_ Still, it has been dne n less.

Grandemnt had saved ut of his salary the sum of six hundred
dllars. Enugh, you would say, for any man to marry on. So, after
a silence f tw years on that subject, he reopened that most
hazardus questin to Mlle. Adèle Fauquier, riding down to Meade
d'r, her father's plantatin. Her answer was the same that it had
been any time during the last ten years: "First find my brther,
Mnsieur Charles."

This time he had std before her, perhaps discouraged by a love
s lng and hopeless, being dependent upon a contingency so
unreasnable, and demanded t be told in simple words whether she
lved him r no.

Adèle lked at him steadily out of her gray eyes that betrayed no
secrets and answered, a little mre sftly:

"Grandemnt, yu have no right to ask that question unless you can
d what I ask f you. Either bring back brother Victor to us or the
prf that he died."

Smehw, though five times thus rejected, his heart was not so heavy
when he left. She had nt denied that she lved. Upon what shallow
waters can the bark f passin remain afloat! Or, shall we play
the dctrinaire, and hint that at thirty-fur the tides of life
are calmer and cgnizant f many sources instead of but one--as at
fur-and-twenty?

Victr Fauquier wuld never be found. In those early days of his
disappearance there was mney t the Charles name, and Grandemont
had spent the dllars as if they were picayunes in trying t find
the lst yuth. Even then he had had small hope of success, for the
Mississippi gives up a victim frm its ily tangles only at the whim
f its malign will.

A thusand times had Grandemnt conned in his mind the scene of
Victr's disappearance. And, at each time that Adèle had set her
stubbrn but pitiful alternative against his suit, still clearer it
repeated itself in his brain.

The by had been the family favurite; daring, winning, reckless.
His unwise fancy had been captured by a girl n the plantatin--the
daughter f an verseer. Victor's family was in ignorance of the
intrigue, as far as it had gne. T save them the inevitable
pain that his curse prmised, Grandemont strove to prevent it.
mniptent money smoothed the way. The overseer and his daughter
left, between a sunset and dawn, fr an undesignated burne.
Grandemnt was cnfident that this stroke would bring the boy
t reasn. He rode over to Meade d'Or to talk with him. The two
strlled ut of the house and grounds, crossed the road, and,
munting the levee, walked its brad path while they conversed.
A thunder-clud was hanging, imminent, abve, but, as yet, no
rain fell. At Grandemnt's disclsure of his interference in the
clandestine rmance, Victr attacked him, in a wild and sudden fury.
Grandemnt, thugh of slight frame, possessed muscles of iron. He
caught the wrists amid a shwer f blows descending upon him, bent
the lad backward and stretched him upn the levee path. In a little
while the gust f passin was spent, and he was allowed to rise.
Calm nw, but a pwder mine where he had been but a whiff of the
tantrums, Victr extended his hand tward the dwelling house of
Meade d'r.

"Yu and they," he cried, "have cnspired to destroy my happiness.
Nne f you shall ever look upon my face again."

Turning, he ran swiftly dwn the levee, disappearing in the
darkness. Grandemnt fllowed as well as he could, calling to
him, but in vain. Fr lnger than an hour he pursued the search.
Descending the side f the levee, he penetrated the rank density f
weeds and willws that undergrew the trees until the river's edge,
shuting Victr's name. There was never an answer, though once he
thught he heard a bubbling scream frm the dun waters sliding past.
Then the strm brke, and he returned to the house drenched and
dejected.

There he explained the by's absence sufficiently, he thught, not
speaking f the tangle that had led t it, for he hoped that Victor
wuld return as son as his anger had cooled. Afterward, when the
threat was made gd and they saw his face no more, he found it
difficult t alter his explanatins of that night, and there clung a
certain mystery t the by's reasons for vanishing as well as to the
manner f it.

It was n that night that Grandemnt first perceived a new and
singular expressin in Adèle's eyes whenever she loked at him. And
thrugh the years fllowing that expression was always there. He
culd nt read it, for it was born of a thought she would never
therwise reveal.

Perhaps, if he had knwn that Adèle had stod at the gate on that
unlucky night, where she had fllwed, lingering, to await the
return f her brther and lover, wondering why they had chosen so
tempestuus an hur and so black a spot to hold converse--if he had
knwn that a sudden flash f lightning had revealed to her sight
that shrt, sharp struggle as Victr was sinking under his hands,
he might have explained everything, and she--

I knw what she wuld have done. But one thing is clear--there was
smething besides her brther's disappearance between Grandemont's
pleadings fr her hand and Adèle's "yes." Ten years had passed, and
what she had seen during the space f that lightning flash remained
an indelible picture. She had lved her brther, but was she holding
ut fr the solution of that mystery or for the "Truth"? Women have
been knwn t reverence it, even as an abstract principle. It is
said there have been a few wh, in the matter f their affections,
have cnsidered a life t be a small thing as compared with a lie.
That I d nt know. But, I wonder, had Grandemont cast himself at
her feet crying that his hand had sent Victr t the bottom of that
inscrutable river, and that he culd n longer sully his love with a
lie, I wnder if--I wnder what she would have done!

But, Grandemnt Charles, Arcadian little gentleman, never guessed
the meaning f that lok in Adèle's eyes; and from this last
btless payment of his devoirs he rode away as rich as ever in
hnur and love, but poor in hope.

That was in September. It was during the first winter mnth that
Grandemnt cnceived his idea of the _renaissance_. Since Adèle
wuld never be his, and wealth withut her were useless trumpery,
why need he add t that hard of slowly harvested dollars? Why
shuld he even retain that hard?

Hundreds were the cigarettes he cnsumed ver his claret, sitting at
the little plished tables in the Ryal street cafés while thinking
ver his plan. By and by he had it perfect. It wuld cost, beyond
dubt, all the mney he had, but--_le jeu vaut la chandelle_--for
sme hurs he would be once more a Charles of Charleroi. Once again
shuld the nineteenth f January, that most significant day in the
frtunes f the house of Charles, be fittingly observed. On that
date the French king had seated a Charles by his side at table;
n that date Armand Charles, Marquis de Brassé, landed, like a
brilliant meter, in New rleans; it was the date of his mother's
wedding; f Grandemnt's birth. Since Grandemont could remember
until the breaking up f the family that anniversary had been the
synnym fr feasting, hospitality, and proud commemoration.

Charleri was the ld family plantation, lying some twenty miles
dwn the river. Years ag the estate had been sold to discharge the
debts f its to-bountiful owners. Once again it had changed hands,
and nw the must and mildew f litigation had settled upon it.
A questin f heirship was in the courts, and the dwelling house
f Charleri, unless the tales told of ghostly powdered and
laced Charleses haunting its uneching chambers were true, stod
uninhabited.

Grandemnt fund the solicitor in chancery who held the keys
pending the decisin. He prved to be an old friend of the family.
Grandemnt explained briefly that he desired t rent the house for
tw r three days. He wanted to give a dinner at his old home to a
few friends. That was all.

"Take it fr a week--a mnth, if you will," said the solicitor;
"but d nt speak to me of rental." With a sigh he concluded: "The
dinners I have eaten under that rf, _mon fils_!"

There came t many f the old, established dealers in furniture,
china, silverware, decratins and household fittings at their
stres n Canal, Chartres, St. Charles, and Royal Streets, a
quiet yung man with a little bald spt on the top of his head,
distinguished manners, and the eye f a _cnnoisseur_, who explained
what he wanted. T hire the cmplete and elegant equipment of a
dining-rm, hall, reception-room, and cloak-rooms. The goods were
t be packed and sent, by bat, to the Charleroi landing, and would
be returned within three r fur days. All damage or loss to be
prmptly paid fr.

Many f thse old merchants knew Grandemont by sight, and the
Charleses f ld by association. Some of them were of Creole stock
and felt a thrill f respnsive sympathy with the magnificently
indiscreet design f this impverished clerk who would revive
but fr a mment the ancient flame of glory with the fuel of his
savings.

"Chse what you want," they said to him. "Handle everything
carefully. See that the damage bill is kept lw, and the charges fr
the lan will nt oppress you."

T the wine merchants next; and here a dleful slice was lopped from
the six hundred. It was an exquisite pleasure t Grandemnt once
mre t pick among the precious vintages. The champagne bins lured
him like the abdes f sirens, but these he was forced to pass. With
his six hundred he std before them as a child with a penny stands
befre a French dll. But he bought with taste and discretion of
ther wines--Chablis, Mselle, Château d'Or, Hochheimer, and port of
right age and pedigree.

The matter f the cuisine gave him sme studious hours until he
suddenly recllected André--André, their ld _chef_--the most
sublime master f French Crele cookery in the Mississippi Valley.
Perhaps he was yet smewhere abut the plantation. The solicitor had
tld him that the place was still being cultivated, in accrdance
with a cmprmise agreement between the litigants.

n the next Sunday after the thught Grandemont rode, horseback,
dwn t Charleroi. The big, square house with its two long ells
lked blank and cheerless with its closed shutters and doors.

The shrubbery in the yard was ragged and ritus. Fallen leaves from
the grve littered the walks and prches. Turning down the lane at
the side f the huse, Grandemont rode on to the quarters of the
plantatin hands. He fund the workers just streaming back from
church, careless, happy, and bedecked in gay yellws, reds, and
blues.

Yes, André was still there; his wl a little grayer; his mouth as
wide; his laughter as ready as ever. Grandemnt tld him of his
plan, and the ld _chef_ swayed with pride and delight. With a sigh
f relief, knwing that he need have no further concern until the
serving f that dinner was annunced, he placed in André's hands
a liberal sum fr the cst of it, giving _carte blanche_ for its
creatin.

Amng the blacks were als a number of the old house servants.
Absalm, the frmer major domo, and a half-dozen of the younger men,
nce waiters and attachés f the kitchen, pantry, and other domestic
departments crwded arund to greet "M'shi Grande." Absalom
guaranteed t marshal, f these, a corps of assistants that would
perfrm with credit the serving f the dinner.

After distributing a liberal largesse amng the faithful, Grandemnt
rde back t town well pleased. There were many other smaller
details t think f and provide for, but eventually the scheme
was cmplete, and nw there remained only the issuance of the
invitatins t his guests.

Alng the river within the scpe of a score of miles dwelt some
half-dzen families with whse princely hospitality that of the
Charleses had been cntempraneous. They were the proudest and most
august f the ld régime. Their small circle had been a brilliant
ne; their scial relations close and warm; their houses full
f rare welcme and discriminating bounty. Those friends, said
Grandemnt, shuld once more, if never again, sit at Charleroi on
a nineteenth f January t celebrate the festal day of his house.

Grandemnt had his cards f invitation engraved. They were
expensive, but beautiful. In ne particular their god taste might
have been disputed; but the Crele allwed himself that one feather
in the cap f his fugacius splendour. Might he not be allowed, for
the ne day f the _renaissance_, to be "Grandemont du Puy Charles,
f Charleri"? He sent the invitations out early in January so that
the guests might nt fail t receive due notice.

At eight 'clck in the morning of the nineteenth, the lower coast
steambat _River Belle_ gingerly apprached the long unused landing
at Charleri. The bridge was lwered, and a swarm of the plantation
hands streamed alng the rtting pier, bearing ashore a strange
assrtment f freight. Great shapeless bundles and bales and packets
swathed in clth and bund with ropes; tubs and urns of palms,
evergreens, and trpical flwers; tables, mirrors, chairs, couches,
carpets, and pictures--all carefully bund and padded against the
dangers f transit.

Grandemnt was amng them, the busiest there. To the safe conveyance
f certain large hampers elquent with printed cautions to delicate
handling he gave his superintendence, fr they cntained the fragile
china and glassware. The drpping f one of those hampers would have
cst him mre than he could have saved in a year.

The last article unladed, the _River Belle_ backed ff and
cntinued her curse down stream. In less than an hour everything
had been cnveyed t the house. And came then Absalom's task,
directing the placing f the furniture and wares. There was plenty
f help, fr that day was always a holiday at Charleroi, and the
Negres did nt suffer the old traditions to lapse. Almost the
entire ppulatin of the quarters volunteered their aid. A score
f piccaninnies were sweeping at the leaves in the yard. In the
big kitchen at the rear André was lrding it with his ld-time
magnificence ver his numerus sub-cooks and scullions. Shutters
were flung wide; dust spun in cluds; the huse echoed to voices and
the tread f busy feet. The prince had cme again, and Charleroi
wke frm its long sleep.

The full mn, as she rose across the river that night and peeped
abve the levee saw a sight that had lng been missing from her
rbit. The ld plantation house shed a soft and alluring radiance
frm every windw. Of its two-score rooms only four had been
refurnished--the larger receptin chamber, the dining hall, and
tw smaller roms for the convenience of the expected guests. But
lighted wax candles were set in the windws f every room.

The dining-hall was the _chef d'euvre_. The lng table, set with
twenty-five cvers, sparkled like a winter landscape with its snwy
napery and china and the icy gleam f crystal. The chaste beauty f
the rm had required small adornment. The polished floor burned
t a glwing ruby with the reflection of candle light. The rich
wainscting reached half way t the ceiling. Along and above this
had been set the relieving lightness f a few water-clour sketches
f fruit and flwer.

The receptin chamber was fitted in a simple but elegant style.
Its arrangement suggested nthing f the fact that on the morrow
the rm would again be cleared and abandoned to the dust and the
spider. The entrance hall was impsing with palms and ferns and the
light f an immense candelabrum.

At seven 'clck Grandemont, in evening dress, with pearls--a
family passin--in his sptless linen, emerged from somewhere. The
invitatins had specified eight as the dining hur. He drew an
armchair upn the prch, and sat there, smoking cigarettes and half
dreaming.

The mn was an hour high. Fifty years back from the gate stood the
huse, under its nble grove. The road ran in front, and then came
the grass-grwn levee and the insatiate river beynd. Just above the
levee tp a tiny red light was creeping dwn and a tiny green one
was creeping up. Then the passing steamers saluted, and the harse
din startled the drwsy silence f the melancholy lowlands. The
stillness returned, save fr the little vices of the night--the
wl's recitative, the capricci of the crickets, the concerto of
the frgs in the grass. The piccaninnies and the dawdlers frm the
quarters had been dismissed t their cnfines, and the melée of
the day was reduced t an rderly and intelligent silence. The six
clured waiters, in their white jackets, paced, cat-footed, about
the table, pretending t arrange where all was beynd betterment.
Absalm, in black and shining pumps psed, superior, here and there
where the lights set ff his grandeur. And Grandemnt rested in his
chair, waiting fr his guests.

He must have drifted int a dream--and an extravagant ne--for he
was master f Charleri and Adèle was his wife. She was coming out
t him nw; he could hear her steps; he could feel her hand upon his
shulder--

"_Pardn mi, M'shi Grande_"--it was Absalom's hand touching him, it
was Absalm's vice, speaking the _patois_ of the blacks--"but it is
eight 'clck."

Eight 'clck. Grandemont sprang up. In the moonlight he could see
the rw f hitching-posts outside the gate. Long ago the horses of
the guests shuld have stod there. They were vacant.

A chanted rar f indignation, a just, waxing bellow of affront and
dishnured genius came from André's kitchen, filling the house with
rhythmic prtest. The beautiful dinner, the pearl f a dinner, the
little excellent superb jewel f a dinner! But ne moment more of
waiting and nt even the thusand thunders of black pigs of the
quarter wuld tuch it!

"They are a little late," said Grandemnt, calmly. "They will cme
sn. Tell André to hold back dinner. And ask him if, by some
chance, a bull frm the pastures has brken, roaring, into the
huse."

He seated himself again t his cigarettes. Thugh he had said it,
he scarcely believed Charleri wuld entertain company that night.
Fr the first time in histry the invitation of a Charles had been
ignred. S simple in courtesy and honour was Grandemont, and,
perhaps, s serenely cnfident in the prestige of his name, that the
mst likely reasns for the vacant board did not occur to him.

Charleri stod by a road travelled daily by people from those
plantatins whither his invitatins had gone. No doubt even on the
day befre the sudden reanimatin of the old house they had driven
past and bserved the evidences f long desertion and decay. They
had lked at the corpse of Charleroi and then at Grandemont's
invitatins, and, thugh the puzzle or tasteless hoax or whatever
the thing meant left them perplexed, they wuld nt seek its
slutin by the folly of a visit to that deserted house.

The mn was now above the grove, and the yard was pied with deep
shadws save where they lightened in the tender glw of outpouring
candle light. A crisp breeze frm the river hinted at the
pssibility f frost when the night should have become older. The
grass at ne side f the steps was specked with the white stubs of
Grandemnt's cigarettes. The ctton-broker's clerk sat in his chair
with the smke spiralling abve him. I doubt that he once thought of
the little frtune he had s impotently squandered. Perhaps it was
cmpensatin enough for him to sit thus at Charleroi for a few
retrieved hurs. Idly his mind wandered in and ut many fanciful
paths f memry. He smiled to himself as a paraphrased line of
Scripture strayed int his mind: "A certain _por_ man made a
feast."

He heard the sund f Absalom coughing a note of summons. Grandemont
stirred. This time he had nt been asleep--nly drowsing.

"Nine 'clck, _M'shi Grande_," said Absalom in the uninflected
vice f a good servant who states a fact unqualified by personal
pinin.

Grandemnt rse to his feet. In their time all the Charleses had
been prven, and they were gallant lsers.

"Serve dinner," he said calmly. And then he checked Absalm's
mvement t obey, for something clicked the gate latch and was
cming dwn the walk toward the house. Something that shuffled its
feet and muttered t itself as it came. It stpped in the current of
light at the ft of the steps and spake, in the universal whine of
the gadding mendicant.

"Kind sir, culd yu spare a poor, hungry man, out of luck, a little
t eat? And t sleep in the corner of a shed? For"--the thing
cncluded, irrelevantly--"I can sleep nw. There are no mountains
t dance reels in the night; and the cpper kettles are all scoured
bright. The irn band is still arund my ankle, and a link, if it is
yur desire I shuld be chained."

It set a ft upon the step and drew up the rags that hung upon the
limb. Abve the distrted shoe, caked with the dust of a hundred
leagues, they saw the link and the irn band. The clthes of the
tramp were wreaked t piebald tatters by sun and rain and wear. A
mat f brwn, tangled hair and beard covered his head and face, out
f which his eyes stared distractedly. Grandemnt noticed that he
carried in ne hand a white, square card.

"What is that?" he asked.

"I picked it up, sir, at the side f the rad." The vagabond handed
the card t Grandemnt. "Just a little to eat, sir. A little parched
crn, a _tartilla_, r a handful of beans. Goat's meat I cannot eat.
When I cut their thrats they cry like children."

Grandemnt held up the card. It was ne of his own invitations to
dinner. N dubt some one had cast it away from a passing carriage
after cmparing it with the tenantless huse of Charleroi.

"Frm the hedges and highways bid them cme," he said to himself,
sftly smiling. And then t Absalom: "Send Louis to me."

Luis, nce his own body-servant, came promptly, in his white
jacket.

"This gentleman," said Grandemnt, "will dine with me. Furnish him
with bath and clthes. In twenty minutes have him ready and dinner
served."

Luis apprached the disreputable guest with the suavity due to a
visitr t Charleroi, and spirited him away to inner regions.

Prmptly, in twenty minutes, Absalm announced dinner, and, a moment
later, the guest was ushered int the dining hall where Grandemnt
waited, standing, at the head f the table. The attentins of Louis
had transfrmed the stranger int something resembling the polite
animal. Clean linen and an ld evening suit that had been sent dwn
frm twn to clothe a waiter had worked a miracle with his exterior.
Brush and cmb had partially subdued the wild disrder of his hair.
Nw he might have passed fr no more extravagant a thing than one of
thse _pseurs_ in art and music who affect such oddity of guise.
The man's cuntenance and demeanur, as he approached the table,
exhibited nthing f the awkwardness or confusion to be expected
frm his Arabian Nights change. He allwed Absalom to seat him at
Grandemnt's right hand with the manner f one thus accustomed to
be waited upn.

"It grieves me," said Grandemnt, "t be obliged to exchange names
with a guest. My wn name is Charles."

"In the muntains," said the wayfarer, "they call me Gring. Along
the rads they call me Jack."

"I prefer the latter," said Grandemnt. "A glass f wine with you,
Mr. Jack."

Curse after curse was served by the supernumerous waiters.
Grandemnt, inspired by the results f André's exquisite skill in
ckery and his own in the selection of wines became the model host,
talkative, witty, and genial. The guest was fitful in cnversatin.
His mind seemed t be sustaining a successin of waves of dementia
fllwed by intervals of comparative lucidity. There was the glassy
brightness f recent fever in his eyes. A lng course of it must
have been the cause f his emaciatin and weakness, his distracted
mind, and the dull pallr that shwed even through the tan of wind
and sun.

"Charles," he said t Grandemnt--for thus he seemed to interpret
his name--"yu never saw the muntains dance, did you?"

"N, Mr. Jack," answered Grandemnt, gravely, "the spectacle has
been denied me. But, I assure yu, I can understand it must be a
diverting sight. The big nes, yu know, white with snow on the
tps, waltzing--_déclleté_, we may say."

"Yu first scur the kettles," said Mr. Jack, leaning toward him
excitedly, "t cok the beans in the morning, and you lie down on a
blanket and keep quite still. Then they cme ut and dance for you.
Yu wuld go out and dance with them but you are chained every night
t the centre ple of the hut. You believe the mountains dance,
dn't yu, Charlie?"

"I cntradict n traveller's tales," said Grandemont, with a smile.

Mr. Jack laughed ludly. He drpped his voice to a confidential
whisper.

"Yu are a fol to believe it," he went on. "They don't really
dance. It's the fever in yur head. It's the hard wrk and the
bad water that des it. Yu are sick for weeks and there is no
medicine. The fever cmes n every evening, and then you are as
strng as tw men. One night the _compania_ are lying drunk with
_mescal_. They have brught back sacks f silver dollars from a
ride, and they drink t celebrate. In the night yu file the chain
in tw and g down the mountain. You walk for miles--hundreds of
them. By and by the muntains are all gne, and you come to the
prairies. They d nt dance at night; they are merciful, and you
sleep. Then yu cme to the river, and it says things to you. You
fllw it down, down, but you can't find what you are looking for."

Mr. Jack leaned back in his chair, and his eyes slwly clsed. The
fd and wine had steeped him in a deep calm. The tense strain had
been smthed from his face. The languor of repletion was claiming
him. Drwsily he spke again.

"It's bad manners--I knw--t go to sleep--at table--but--that
was--such a gd dinner--Grande, old fellow."

_Grande!_ The wner f the name started and set down his glass.
Hw shuld this wretched tatterdemalion whom he had invited,
Caliph-like, t sit at his feet knw his name?

Nt at first, but son, little by little, the suspicion, wild and
unreasnable as it was, stle into his brain. He drew out his watch
with hands that almst balked him by their trembling, and pened the
back case. There was a picture there--a phtgraph fixed to the
inner side.

Rising, Grandemnt shok Mr. Jack by the shoulder. The weary guest
pened his eyes. Grandemnt held the watch.

"Lk at this picture, Mr. Jack. Have you ever--"

"_My sister Adèle!_"

The vagrant's vice rang lud and sudden through the room. He
started t his feet, but Grandemnt's arms were about him, and
Grandemnt was calling him "Victr!--Victor Fauquier! _Merci, merci,
mn Dieu!_"

T far overcome by sleep and fatigue was the lost one to talk that
night. Days afterward, when the trpic _calentura_ had coled in
his veins, the disrdered fragments he had spken were completed in
shape and sequence. He tld the stry of his angry flight, of toils
and calamities n sea and shre, of his ebbing and flowing fortune
in suthern lands, and f his latest peril when, held a captive, he
served menially in a strnghld of bandits in the Sonora Mountains
f Mexic. And of the fever that seized him there and his escape and
delirium, during which he strayed, perhaps led by sme marvellus
instinct, back t the river n whose bank he had been born. And of
the prud and stubbrn thing in his blood that had kept him silent
thrugh all thse years, clouding the honour of one, though he knew
it nt, and keeping apart tw loving hearts. "What a thing is love!"
yu may say. And if I grant it, yu shall say, with me: "What a
thing is pride!"

n a cuch in the reception chamber Victor lay, with a dawning
understanding in his heavy eyes and peace in his sftened
cuntenance. Absalm was preparing a lounge for the transient
master f Charleri, who, to-morrow, would be again the clerk of a
cttn-broker, but also--

"T-mrrow," Grandemont was saying, as he stood by the couch of his
guest, speaking the wrds with his face shining as must have shne
the face f Elijah's chariteer when he announced the glories of
that heavenly jurney--"T-morrow I will take you to Her."




XVIII

N BEHALF F THE MANAGEMENT


This is the stry f the man manager, and how he held his own until
the very last paragraph.

I had it frm Sully Magon, _viva voce_. The words are indeed his;
and if they d nt constitute truthful fiction my memory should be
taxed with the blame.

It is nt deemed amiss t point out, in the beginning, the stress
that is laid upn the masculinity f the manager. For, according
t Sully, the term when applied t the feminine division of
mankind has precisely an ppsite meaning. The woman manager (he
says) ecnmizes, saves, oppresses her household with bargains and
cntrivances, and loks sourly upon any pence that are cast to the
fiddler fr even a single jig-step n life's arid march. Wherefore
her men-flk call her blessed, and praise her; and then sneak ut
the backdr to see the Gilhooly Sisters do a buck-and-wing dance.

Nw, the man manager (I still qute Sully) is a Cæsar without
a Brutus. He is an autcrat withut responsibility, a player
wh imperils n stake of his own. His office is to enact, to
reverberate, t bom, to expand, to out-coruscate--profitably, if
he can. Bill-paying and grwing gray hairs ver results belong to
his principals. It is his t guide the risk, t be the Apotheosis
f Frnt, the three-tailed Bashaw of Bluff, the Essential Oil of
Razzle-Dazzle.

We sat at lunchen, and Sully Magon told me. I asked for
particulars.

"My ld friend Denver Gallway was a born manager," said Sully. He
first saw the light f day in New Yrk at three years of age. He
was brn in Pittsburg, but his parents mved East the third summer
afterward.

"When Denver grew up, he went int the managing business. At the
age f eight he managed a news-stand fr the Dago that owned it.
After that he was manager at different times f a skating-rink, a
livery-stable, a plicy game, a restaurant, a dancing academy, a
walking match, a burlesque cmpany, a dry-gods store, a dozen
htels and summer resrts, an insurance company, and a district
leader's campaign. That campaign, when Cughlin was elected n
the East Side, gave Denver a bst. It got him a job as manager
f a Bradway hotel, and for a while he managed Senator O'Grady's
campaign in the nineteenth.

"Denver was a New Yrker all ver. I think he was out of the city
just twice befre the time I'm ging to tell you about. Once he went
rabbit-shting in Yonkers. The other time I met him just landing
frm a Nrth River ferry. 'Been out West on a big trip, Sully, old
by,' says he. 'Gad! Sully, I had n idea we had such a big country.
It's immense. Never cnceived f the magnificence of the West
befre. It's grgeous and glorious and infinite. Makes the East
seemed cramped and little. It's a grand thing t travel and get an
idea f the extent and resurces of our country.'

"I'd made several little runs ut t California and down to Mexico
and up thrugh Alaska, s I sits down with Denver for a chat about
the things he saw.

"'Tk in the Yosemite, out there, of course?' I asks.

"'Well--n,' says Denver, 'I dn't think so. At least, I don't
recllect it. Yu see, I only had three days, and I didn't get any
farther west than Yungstwn, Ohio.'

"Abut tw years ago I dropped into New York with a little fly-paper
prpsition about a Tennessee mica mine that I wanted to spread
ut in a nice, sunny windw, in the hopes of catching a few. I was
cming ut of a printing-shop one afternoon with a batch of fine,
sticky prspectuses when I ran against Denver cming round a corner.
I never saw him lking so much like a tiger-lily. He was as
beautiful and new as a trellis f sweet peas, and as rllicking as
a clarinet sl. We shook hands, and he asked me what I was doing,
and I gave him the utlines f the scandal I was trying to create in
mica.

"'Ph, pooh! for your mica,' says Denver. 'Don't you know better,
Sully, than t bump up against the cffers of little old New York
with anything as transparent as mica? Nw, yu come with me over to
the Htel Brunswick. Yu're just the man I was hoping for. I've got
smething there in sepia and curled hair that I want yu to look
at.'

"'Yu putting up at the Brunswick?' I asks.

"'Nt a cent,' says Denver, cheerful. 'The syndicate that wns the
htel puts up. I'm manager.'

"The Brunswick wasn't ne f them Broadway pot-houses all full of
palms and hyphens and flwers and cstumes--kind of a mixture of
lawns and laundries. It was n ne of the East Side avenues; but it
was a slid, ld-time caravansary such as the Mayor of Skaneateles
r the Gvernor of Missouri might stop at. Eight stories high it
stalked up, with new striped awnings, and the electrics had it as
light as day.

"'I've been manager here fr a year,' says Denver, as we drew nigh.
'When I tk charge,' says he, 'nobody nor nothing ever stopped at
the Brunswick. The clck ver the clerks' desk used to run for weeks
withut winding. A man fell dead with heart-disease n the sidewalk
in frnt f it one day, and when they went to pick him up he was two
blcks away. I figured ut a scheme to catch the West Indies and
Suth American trade. I persuaded the wners to invest a few more
thusands, and I put every cent f it in electric lights, cayenne
pepper, gld-leaf, and garlic. I gt a Spanish-speaking force of
emplyees and a string band; and there was talk ging round of a
cckfight in the basement every Sunday. Maybe I didn't catch the
nut-brwn gang! Frm Havana to Patagonia the Don Señors knew about
the Brunswick. We get the highfliers frm Cuba and Mexic and the
cuple f Americas farther south; and they've simply got the boodle
t bmbard every bulfinch in the bush with.'

"When we gt t the hotel, Denver stops me at the door.

"'There's a little liver-clured man,' says he, 'sitting in a big
leather chair t yur right, inside. You sit down and watch him for
a few minutes, and then tell me what yu think.'

"I tk a chair, while Denver circulates around in the big rotunda.
The rm was about full of curly-headed Cubans and South American
brunettes f different shades; and the atmsphere was international
with cigarette smke, lit up by diamnd rings and edged off with a
whisper f garlic.

"That Denver Gallway was sure a relief t the eye. Six feet two
he was, red-headed and pink-gilled as a sun-perch. And the air he
had! Curt f Saint James, Chauncy Olcott, Kentucky colonels, Count
f Mnte Cristo, grand opera--all these things he reminded you of
when he was ding the hnours. When he raised his finger the hotel
prters and bell-bys skated across the floor like cockroaches, and
even the clerk behind the desk lked as meek and unimportant as
Andy Carnegie.

"Denver passed arund, shaking hands with his guests, and saying
ver the tw or three Spanish words he knew until it was like a
crnation rehearsal or a Bryan barbecue in Texas.

"I watched the little man he tld me t. 'Twas a little foreign
persn in a duble-breasted frock-coat, trying to touch the floor
with his tes. He was the clour of vici kid, and his whiskers was
like excelsir made ut of mahogany wood. He breathed hard, and
he never nce tok his eyes off of Denver. There was a look of
admiratin and respect n his face like you see on a boy that's
fllwing a champion base-ball team, or the Kaiser William looking
at himself in a glass.

"After Denver ges his runds he takes me into his private office.

"'What's yur reprt on the dingy I told you to watch?' he asks.

"'Well,' says I, 'if yu was as big a man as he takes yu to be,
nine rms and bath in the Hall of Fame, rent free till October 1st,
wuld be abut your size.'

"'Yu've caught the idea,' says Denver. 'I've given him the wizard
grip and the cabalistic eye. The glamur that emanates frm yours
truly has envelped him like a Nrth River fog. He seems to think
that Señr Gallway is the man who. I guess they don't raise 74-inch
srrel-tps with romping ways down in his precinct. Now, Sully,'
ges n Denver, 'if you was asked, what would you take the little
man t be?'

"'Why,' says I, 'the barber arund the crner; or, if he's royal,
the king f the bot-blacks.'

"'Never judge by lks,' says Denver; 'he's the dark-horse candidate
fr president f a South American republic.'

"'Well,' says I, 'he didn't lk quite that bad to me.'

"Then Denver draws his chair up clse and gives ut his scheme.

"'Sully,' says he, with seriusness and levity, 'I've been a manager
f ne thing and another for over twenty years. That's what I was
cut ut fr--to have somebody else to put up the money and look
after the repairs and the plice and taxes while I run the business.
I never had a dllar f my own invested in my life. I wouldn't know
hw it felt t have the dealer rake in a coin of mine. But I can
handle ther peple's stuff and manage other people's enterprises.
I've had an ambitin t get hold of something big--something higher
than htels and lumber-yards and lcal politics. I want to be
manager f smething way up--like a railroad or a diamond trust
r an autmobile factory. Now here comes this little man from the
trpics with just what I want, and he's ffered me the job.'

"'What jb?' I asks. 'Is he ging to revive the Georgia Minstrels or
pen a cigar stre?'

"'He's n 'con,' says Denver. 'He's General Rompiro--General Josey
Alfns Sapolio Jew-Ann Rompiro--he has his cards printed by a
news-ticker. He's the real thing, Sully, and he wants me t manage
his campaign--he wants Denver C. Gallway fr a president-maker.
Think f that, Sully! ld Denver romping down to the tropics,
plucking ltus-flwers and pineapples with one hand and making
presidents with the ther! Wn't it make Uncle Mark Hanna mad? And I
want yu t go too, Sully. You can help me more than any man I know.
I've been herding that brwn man fr a month in the hotel so he
wuldn't stray dwn Fourteenth Street and get roped in by that crowd
f refugee tamale-eaters dwn there. And he's landed, and D. C. G.
is manager f General J. A. S. J. Rmpiro's presidential campaign in
the great republic f--what's its name?'

"Denver gets dwn an atlas frm a shelf, and we have a look at the
afflicted cuntry. 'Twas a dark blue ne, on the west coast, about
the size f a special delivery stamp.

"'Frm what the General tells me,' says Denver, 'and frm what I
can gather frm the encyclpædia and by conversing with the janitor
f the Astr Library, it'll be as easy to handle the vote of that
cuntry as it wuld be for Tammany to get a man named Geoghan
appinted n the White Wings force.'

"'Why dn't General Rumptyr stay at home,' says I, 'and manage his
wn canvass?'

"'Yu dn't understand South American politics,' says Denver,
getting ut the cigars. 'It's this way. General Rmpiro had the
misfrtune f becoming a popular idol. He distinguished himself
by leading the army in pursuit f a cuple of sailors who had
stlen the plaza--r the carramba, or something belonging to the
gvernment. The peple called him a hero and the government got
jealus. The president sends fr the chief of the Department of
Public Edifices. "Find me a nice, clean adbe wall," says he, "and
send Señr Rmpiro up against it. Then call out a file of soldiers
and--then let him be up against it." Smething,' ges on Denver,
'like the way they've treated Hbsn and Carrie Nation in our
cuntry. S the General had to flee. But he was thoughtful enough
t bring alng his roll. He's got sinews of war enough to buy a
battleship and flat her ff in the christening fluid.'

"'What chance has he gt t be president?'

"'Wasn't I just giving yu his rating?' says Denver. 'His cuntry
is ne f the few in South America where the presidents are elected
by ppular ballt. The General can't go there just now. It hurts
t be sht against a wall. He needs a campaign manager to go down
and whp things up for him--to get the boys in line and the new
tw-dllar bills afloat and the babies kissed and the machine in
running rder. Sully, I dn't want to brag, but you remember how I
brught Cughlin under the wire for leader of the nineteenth? Ours
was the banner district. Dn't yu suppose I know how to manage a
little mnkey-cage f a country like that? Why, with the dough the
General's willing t turn lose I could put two more coats of Japan
varnish n him and have him elected Gvernor of Georgia. New York
has gt the finest lt of campaign managers in the world, Sully, and
yu give me a feeling f hauteur when you cast doubts on my ability
t handle the plitical situation in a country so small that they
have t print the names f the towns in the appendix and footnotes.'

"I argued with Denver sme. I tld him that politics down in that
trpical atmsphere was bound to be different from the nineteenth
district; but I might just as well have been a Cngressman frm
Nrth Dakta trying to get an appropriation for a lighthouse and a
cast survey. Denver Gallway had ambitions in the manager line, and
what I said didn't amunt t as much as a fig-leaf at the National
Dressmakers' Cnventin. 'I'll give you three days to cogitate about
ging,' says Denver; 'and I'll intrduce you to General Rompiro
t-mrrow, so you can get his ideas drawn right from the rose wood.'

"I put n my best receptin-to-Booker-Washington manner the next
day and tapped the distinguished rubber-plant fr what he knew.

"General Rmpir wasn't so gloomy inside as he appeared on the
surface. He was plite enugh; and he exuded a number of sounds that
made a fair stagger at arranging themselves int language. It was
English he aimed at, and when his system f syntax reached yur
mind it wasn't past yu t understand it. If you took a college
prfessr's magazine essay and a Chinese laundryman's explanation
f a lst shirt and jumbled 'em together, you'd have about what the
General handed yu ut for conversation. He told me all about his
bleeding cuntry, and what they were trying t do for it before the
dctr came. But he mostly talked of Denver C. Galloway.

"'Ah, señr,' says he, 'that is the mst fine of mans. Never I have
seen ne man s magnifico, so gr-r-rand, so conformable to make done
things s swiftly by ther mans. He shall make other mans do the
acts and himself t rder and regulate, until we arrive at seeing
accmplishments f a suddenly. Oh, yes, señor. In my countree there
is nt such mans f so beegness, so good talk, so compliments, so
strngness f sense and such. Ah, that Señor Galloway!'

"'Yes,' says I, 'ld Denver is the by you want. He's managed every
kind f business here except filibustering, and he might as well
cmplete the list.'

"Befre the three days was up I decided t join Denver in his
campaign. Denver gt three mnths' vacation from his hotel owners.
Fr a week we lived in a rom with the General, and got all the
pinters abut his country that we could interpret from the noises
he made. When we gt ready t start, Denver had a pocket full of
memrandums, and letters frm the General to his friends, and a list
f names and addresses f loyal politicians who would help along
the bm of the exiled popular idol. Besides these liabilities we
carried assets t the amunt of $20,000 in assorted United States
currency. General Rmpir looked like a burnt effigy, but he was
Br'er Fx himself when it came t the real science of politics.

"'Here is mneys,' says the General, 'f a small amount. There is
mre with me--mocho more. Plentee moneys shall you be supplied,
Señr Gallway. More I shall send you at all times that you need.
I shall desire t pay feefty--ne hundred thousand pesos, if
necessari, t be elect. How no? Sacramento! If that I am president
and d nt make one meelion dolla in the one year you shall keek me
n that side!--_valgame Dis!_'

"Denver gt a Cuban cigar-maker t fix up a little cipher code with
English and Spanish wrds, and gave the General a cpy, so we could
cable him bulletins abut the electin, or for more money, and then
we were ready t start. General Rmpiro escorted us to the steamer.
n the pier he hugged Denver arund the waist and sobbed. 'Noble
mans,' says he, 'General Rmpir propels you into his confidence
and trust. G, in the hands f the saints to do the work for your
friend. _Viva la libertad!_'

"'Sure,' says Denver. 'And viva la liberality an' la saperin and
hch der land f the lotus and the vote us. Don't worry, General.
We'll have yu elected as sure as bananas grw upside down.'

"'Make pictures n me,' pleads the General--'make pictures n me for
mney as it is needful.'

"'Des he want t be tattooed, would you think?' asks Denver,
wrinkling up his eyes.

"'Stupid!' says I. 'He wants yu t draw on him for election
expenses. It'll be wrse than tattoing. More like an autopsy.'

"Me and Denver steamed dwn t Panama, and then hiked across the
Isthmus, and then by steamer again dwn t the town of Espiritu on
the cast f the General's country.

"That was a twn t send J. Howard Payne to the growler. I'll tell
yu hw you could make one like it. Take a lot of Filipino huts and
a cuple f hundred brick-kilns and arrange 'em in squares in a
cemetery. Cart dwn all the cnservatory plants in the Astor and
Vanderbilt greenhuses, and stick 'em abut wherever there's room.
Turn all the Bellevue patients and the barbers' cnventin and the
Tuskegee schl loose in the streets, and run the thermometer up to
120 in the shade. Set a fringe f the Rcky Mountains around the
rear, let it rain, and set the whle business n Rockaway Beach in
the middle f January--and yu'd have a good imitation of Espiritu.

"It tk me and Denver about a week to get acclimated. Denver sent
ut the letters the General had given him, and ntified the rest of
the gang that there was smething ding at the captain's office. We
set up headquarters in an ld 'dbe house on a side street where
the grass was waist high. The electin was nly four weeks off; but
there wasn't any excitement. The hme candidate fr president was
named Radrickeys. This twn of Esperitu wasn't the capital any more
than Cleveland, hi, is the capital of the United States, but it
was the plitical centre where they coked up revolutions, and made
up the slates.

"At the end f the week Denver says the machine is started running.

"'Sully,' says he, 'we've gt a walkver. Just because General
Rmpir ain't Don Juan-on-the-spot the other crowd ain't at work.
They're as full f apathy as a territrial delegate during the
chaplain's prayer. Nw, we want t introduce a little hot stuff in
the way f campaigning, and we'll surprise 'em at the plls.'

"'Hw are yu going to go about it?' I asks.

"'Why, the usual way,' says Denver, surprised. 'We'll get the
ratrs on our side out every night to make speeches in the native
ling, and have trch-light parades under the shade of the palms,
and free drinks, and buy up all the brass bands, f curse,
and--well, I'll turn the baby-kissing ver t you, Sully--I've seen
a lt f 'em.'

"'What else?' says I.

"'Why, yu knw,' says Denver. 'We get the heelers out with the
crackly tw-spts, and coal-tickets, and orders for groceries, and
have a cuple f picnics out under the banyan-trees, and dances in
the Firemen's Hall--and the usual things. But first f all, Sully,
I'm ging t have the biggest clam-bake down on the beach that was
ever seen suth f the tropic of Capricorn. I figured that out from
the start. We'll stuff the whle twn and the jungle folk for miles
arund with clams. That's the first thing n the programme. Suppose
yu g out now, and make the arrangements for that. I want to look
ver the estimates the General made f the vote in the coast
districts.'

"I had learned sme Spanish in Mexic, so I goes out, as Denver
says, and in fifteen minutes I cme back t headquarters.

"'If there ever was a clam in this cuntry nbody ever saw it,' I
says.

"'Great sky-rckets!' says Denver, with his muth and eyes open. 'No
clams? Hw in the--wh ever saw a country without clams? What kind
f a--hw's an election to be pulled off without a clam-bake, I'd
like t knw? Are you sure there's no clams, Sully?'

"'Nt even a can,' says I.

"'Then fr Gd's sake go out and try to find what the people here do
eat. We've gt t fill 'em up with grub of some kind.'

"I went ut again. Denver was manager. In half an hur I gets back.

"'They eat,' says I, 'trtillas, cassava, carne de chiv, arroz con
pll, aquacates, zapates, yucca, and huevos fritos.'

"'A man that wuld eat them things,' says Denver, getting a little
mad, 'ught t have his vote challenged.'

"In a few mre days the campaign managers frm the other towns came
sliding int Esperitu. ur headquarters was a busy place. We had
an interpreter, and ice-water, and drinks, and cigars, and Denver
flashed the General's rll s often that it got so small you
culdn't have bught a Republican vote in Ohio with it.

"And then Denver cabled t General Rmpiro for ten thousand dollars
mre and gt it.

"There were a number f Americans in Esperitu, but they were all
in business r grafts f some kind, and wouldn't take any hand in
plitics, which was sensible enugh. But they showed me and Denver a
fine time, and fixed us up s we culd get decent things to eat and
drink. There was ne American, named Hicks, used t come and loaf at
the headquarters. Hicks had had furteen years f Esperitu. He was
six feet fur and weighed in at 135. Ccoa was his line; and coast
fever and the climate had taken all the life ut f him. They said
he hadn't smiled in eight years. His face was three feet lng, and
it never mved except when he pened it to take quinine. He used to
sit in ur headquarters and kill fleas and talk sarcastic.

"'I dn't take much interest in plitics,' says Hicks, one day, 'but
I'd like yu t tell me what you're trying to do down here,
Gallway?'

"'We're bsting General Rompiro, of course,' says Denver. 'We're
ging t put him in the presidential chair. I'm his manager.'

"'Well,' says Hicks, 'if I was yu I'd be a little slwer about it.
Yu've gt a long time ahead of you, you know.'

"'Nt any lnger than I need,' says Denver.

"Denver went ahead and wrked things smoth. He dealt out money on
the quiet t his lieutenants, and they were always cming after it.
There was free drinks fr everybdy in town, and bands playing every
night, and firewrks, and there was a lt of heelers going around
buying up vtes day and night fr the new style of politics in
Espiritu, and everybdy liked it.

"The day set fr the electin was November 4th. On the night before
Denver and me were smking ur pipes in headquarters, and in comes
Hicks and unjints himself, and sits in a chair, murnful. Denver
is cheerful and cnfident. 'Rmpiro will win in a romp,' says he.
'We'll carry the cuntry by 10,000. It's all ver but the vivas.
T-mrrow will tell the tale.'

"'What's ging t happen to-morrow?' asks Hicks.

"'Why, the presidential electin, f course,' says Denver.

"'Say,' says Hicks, lking kind of funny, 'didn't anybody tell you
fellws that the electin was held a week before you came? Congress
changed the date t July 27th. Radrickeys was elected by 17,000.
I thught yu was booming old Rompiro for next term, two years
frm nw. Wondered if you was going to keep up such a hot lick that
lng.'

"I drpped my pipe n the floor. Denver bit the stem off of his.
Neither f us said anything.

"And then I heard a sund like smebody ripping a clapboard off of a
barn-rf. 'Twas Hicks laughing for the first time in eight years."

Sully Magn paused while the waiter poured us a black coffee.

"Yur friend was, indeed, smething of a manager," I said.

"Wait a minute," said Sully, "I haven't given yu any idea f what
he culd d yet. That's all to come.

"When we gt back t New York there was General Rompiro waiting for
us n the pier. He was dancing like a cinnamn bear, all impatient
fr the news, fr Denver had just cabled him when we would arrive
and nthing mre.

"'Am I elect?' he shuts. 'Am I elect, friend f mine? Is that mine
cuntry have demand General Rmpiro for the president? The last
dllar f mine have I sent you that last time. It is necessario that
I am elect. I have nt mre money. Am I elect, Señor Galloway?'

"Denver turns t me.

"'Leave me with ld Rmpey, Sully,' he says. 'I've got to break it
t him gently. 'Twuld be indecent for other eyes to witness the
peratin. This is the time, Sully,' says he, 'when old Denver has
gt t make good as a jollier and a silver-tongued sorcerer, or else
give up all the medals he's earned.'

"A cuple f days later I went around to the hotel. There was Denver
in his ld place, loking like the hero of two historical novels,
and telling 'em what a fine time he'd had dwn n his orange
plantatin in Flrida.

"'Did yu fix things up with the General?' I asks him.

"'Did I?' says Denver. 'Cme and see.'

"He takes me by the arm and walks me t the dining-rom door. There
was a little chclate-brown fat man in a dress suit, with his face
shining with jy as he swelled himself and skipped abut the floor.
Danged if Denver hadn't made General Rmpir head waiter of the
Htel Brunswick!"

"Is Mr. Gallway still in the managing business?" I asked, as Mr.
Magn ceased.

Sully shk his head.

"Denver married an auburn-haired widw that wns a big hotel in
Harlem. He just helps arund the place."

WHISTLING DICK'S CHRISTMAS STCKING


It was with much cautin that Whistling Dick slid back the dor of
the bx-car, fr Article 5716, City Ordinances, authorized (perhaps
uncnstitutinally) arrest on suspicion, and he was familiar of old
with this rdinance. S, before climbing out, he surveyed the field
with all the care f a god general.

He saw n change since his last visit t this big, alms-giving,
lng-suffering city f the South, the cold weather paradise of the
tramps. The levee where his freight-car std was pimpled with dark
bulks f merchandise. The breeze reeked with the well-remembered,
sickening smell f the ld tarpaulins that covered bales and
barrels. The dun river slipped alng amng the shipping with an oily
gurgle. Far dwn tward Chalmette he could see the great bend in the
stream, utlined by the rw of electric lights. Across the river
Algiers lay, a lng, irregular blt, made darker by the dawn which
lightened the sky beynd. An industrius tug or two, coming for
sme early sailing ship, gave a few appalling tots, that seemed to
be the signal fr breaking day. The Italian luggers were creeping
nearer their landing, laden with early vegetables and shellfish. A
vague rar, subterranean in quality, frm dray wheels and street
cars, began t make itself heard and felt; and the ferrybats, the
Mary Anns f water craft, stirred sullenly t their menial morning
tasks.

Whistling Dick's red head ppped suddenly back int the car. A sight
t imposing and magnificent for his gaze had been added to the
scene. A vast, incmparable pliceman rounded a pile of rice sacks
and std within twenty yards of the car. The daily miracle of the
dawn, nw being perfrmed above Algiers, received the flattering
attentin f this specimen of municipal official splendour. He
gazed with unbiased dignity at the faintly glwing clours until,
at last, he turned t them his brad back, as if convinced that
legal interference was nt needed, and the sunrise might prceed
unchecked. S he turned his face t the rice bags, and, drawing
a flat flask frm an inside pcket, he placed it to his lips and
regarded the firmament.

Whistling Dick, prfessinal tramp, possessed a half-friendly
acquaintance with this fficer. They had met several times befre on
the levee at night, fr the fficer, himself a lover of music, had
been attracted by the exquisite whistling f the shiftless vagabnd.
Still, he did nt care, under the present circumstances, t renew
the acquaintance. There is a difference between meeting a pliceman
n a lnely wharf and whistling a few operatic airs with him, and
being caught by him crawling ut f a freight-car. So Dick waited,
as even a New rleans pliceman must move on some time--perhaps
it is a retributive law f nature--and befre long "Big Fritz"
majestically disappeared between the trains f cars.

Whistling Dick waited as lng as his judgment advised, and then
slid swiftly t the grund. Assuming as far as possible the air of
an hnest laburer who seeks his daily toil, he moved across the
netwrk f railway lines, with the intention of making his way by
quiet Gird Street t a certain bench in Lafayette Square, where,
accrding t appointment, he hoped to rejoin a pal known as "Slick,"
this adventurus pilgrim having preceded him by ne day in a
cattle-car int which a lose slat had enticed him.

As Whistling Dick picked his way where night still lingered amng
the big, reeking, musty warehuses, he gave way t the habit that
had wn fr him his title. Subdued, yet clear, with each note as
true and liquid as a bblink's, his whistle tinkled about the dim,
cld muntains of brick like drops of rain falling into a hidden
pl. He followed an air, but it swam mistily into a swirling
current f imprvisation. You could cull out the trill of mountain
brks, the staccato of green rushes shivering above chilly lagoons,
the pipe f sleepy birds.

Runding a crner, the whistler collided with a mountain of blue and
brass.

"S," bserved the mountain calmly, "You are already pack. Und dere
vill nt pe frst before two veeks yet! Und you haf forgotten how to
vistle. Dere was a valse nte in dt last bar."

"Watcher knw abut it?" said Whistling Dick, with tentative
familiarity; "yu wit yer little Gherman-band nixcumrus chunes.
Watcher knw abut music? Pick yer ears, and listen agin. Here's de
way I whistled it--see?"

He puckered his lips, but the big pliceman held up his hand.

"Shtp," he said, "und learn der right way. Und learn als dot a
rlling shtne can't vistle for a cent."

Big Fritz's heavy mustache runded into a circle, and from its
depths came a sund deep and mellw as that from a flute. He
repeated a few bars f the air the tramp had been whistling. The
renditin was cld, but correct, and he emphasized the note he had
taken exceptin t.

"Dt p is p natural, und nt p vlat. Py der vay, you petter pe glad
I meet yu. Vn hour later, und I vould half to put you in a gage
t vistle mit der chail pirds. Der rders are to bull all der pums
after sunrise."

"T which?"

"T bull der pums--eferybdy mitout fisible means. Dirty days is der
price, r fifteen tllars."

"Is dat straight, r a game yu givin' me?"

"It's der pest tip yu efer had. I gif it t you pecause I pelief
yu are nt so bad as der rest. Und pecause you gan visl 'Der
Freischütz' bezzer dan I myself gan. Dn't run against any mre
blicemans arundt der corners, but go away from town a few tays.
Gd-pye."

S Madame rleans had at last grown weary of the strange and ruffled
brd that came yearly to nestle beneath her charitable pinions.

After the big pliceman had departed, Whistling Dick stod for
an irreslute minute, feeling all the utraged indignation of a
delinquent tenant wh is rdered to vacate his premises. He had
pictured t himself a day f dreamful ease when he should have
jined his pal; a day f lounging on the wharf, munching the bananas
and ccanuts scattered in unloading the fruit steamers; and then
a feast alng the free-lunch cunters from which the easy-going
wners were to good-natured or too generous to drive him away, and
afterward a pipe in ne f the little flowery parks and a snooze
in sme shady crner of the wharf. But here was a stern order to
exile, and ne that he knew must be beyed. So, with a wary eye
pen fr the gleam of brass buttons, he began his retreat toward a
rural refuge. A few days in the cuntry need nt necessarily prove
disastrus. Beynd the possibility of a slight nip of frost, there
was n frmidable evil to be looked for.

Hwever, it was with a depressed spirit that Whistling Dick passed
the ld French market n his chosen route down the river. For
safety's sake he still presented t the wrld his portrayal of the
part f the wrthy artisan on his way to labour. A stall-keeper in
the market, undeceived, hailed him by the generic name f his ilk,
and "Jack" halted, taken by surprise. The vender, melted by this
prf of his own acuteness, bestowed a foot of Frankfurter and half
a laf, and thus the prblem of breakfast was solved.

When the streets, frm tpographical reasons, began to shun the
river bank the exile munted t the top of the levee, and on its
well-trdden path pursued his way. The suburban eye regarded him
with cld suspicin, individuals reflected the stern spirit of the
city's heartless edict. He missed the seclusin f the crowded town
and the safety he culd always find in the multitude.

At Chalmette, six miles upn his desultry way, there suddenly
menaced him a vast and bewildering industry. A new prt was being
established; the dck was being built, cmpresses were going up;
picks and shvels and barrws struck at him like serpents from every
side. An arrgant freman bore down upon him, estimating his muscles
with the eye f a recruiting-sergeant. Brwn men and black men all
abut him were tiling away. He fled in terror.

By nn he had reached the country of the plantations, the great,
sad, silent levels brdering the mighty river. He verlooked fields
f sugar-cane s vast that their farthest limits melted into the
sky. The sugar-making seasn was well advanced, and the cutters
were at wrk; the waggns creaked drearily after them; the Negro
teamsters inspired the mules t greater speed with mellw and
snrous imprecations. Dark-green groves, blurred by the blue
f distance, shwed where the plantation-houses stood. The tall
chimneys f the sugar-mills caught the eye miles distant, like
lighthuses at sea.

At a certain pint Whistling Dick's unerring nse caught the scent
f frying fish. Like a pinter to a quail, he made his way down
the levee side straight t the camp f a credulous and ancient
fisherman, whm he charmed with sng and story, so that he dined
like an admiral, and then like a philspher annihilated the worst
three hurs f the day by a nap under the trees.

When he awke and again cntinued his hegira, a frosty sparkle in
the air had succeeded the drwsy warmth f the day, and as this
prtent f a chilly night translated itself to the brain of Sir
Peregrine, he lengthened his stride and bethught him f shelter. He
travelled a rad that faithfully fllowed the convolutions of the
levee, running alng its base, but whither he knew nt. Bushes and
rank grass crwded it t the wheel ruts, and out of this ambuscade
the pests f the lwlands swarmed after him, humming a keen, vicious
spran. And as the night grew nearer, although colder, the whine
f the msquitoes became a greedy, petulant snarl that shut out all
ther sunds. To his right, against the heavens, he saw a green
light mving, and, accmpanying it, the masts and funnels of a big
incming steamer, mving as upon a screen at a magic-lantern show.
And there were mysterius marshes at his left, ut of which came
queer gurgling cries and a chked craking. The whistling vagrant
struck up a merry warble t ffset these melancholy influences, and
it is likely that never befre, since Pan himself jigged it n his
reeds, had such sunds been heard in thse depressing solitudes.

A distant clatter in the rear quickly develped int the swift beat
f hrses' hoofs, and Whistling Dick stepped aside into the dew-wet
grass t clear the track. Turning his head, he saw appraching a
fine team f stylish grays drawing a duble surrey. A stout man
with a white mustache ccupied the front seat, giving all his
attentin t the rigid lines in his hands. Behind him sat a placid,
middle-aged lady and a brilliant-lking girl hardly arrived at
yung ladyhod. The lap-robe had slipped partly from the knees of
the gentleman driving, and Whistling Dick saw tw stut canvas bags
between his feet--bags such as, while lafing in cities, he had
seen warily transferred between express waggns and bank dors. The
remaining space in the vehicle was filled with parcels f varius
sizes and shapes.

As the surrey swept even with the sidetracked tramp, the bright-eyed
girl, seized by sme merry, madcap impulse, leaned ut toward him
with a sweet, dazzling smile, and cried, "Mer-ry Christ-mas!" in a
shrill, plaintive treble.

Such a thing had nt ften happened to Whistling Dick, and he felt
handicapped in devising the crrect respnse. But lacking time
fr reflectin, he let his instinct decide, and snatching off his
battered derby, he rapidly extended it at arm's length, and drew it
back with a cntinuus motion, and shouted a loud, but ceremonious,
"Ah, there!" after the flying surrey.

The sudden mvement f the girl had caused one of the parcels to
becme unwrapped, and smething limp and black fell from it into the
rad. The tramp picked it up, and fund it to be a new black silk
stcking, lng and fine and slender. It crunched crisply, and yet
with a luxurius sftness, between his fingers.

"Ther blmin' little skeezicks!" said Whistling Dick, with a broad
grin bisecting his freckled face. "W't d' yer think f dat, now!
Mer-ry Chris-mus! Sunded like a cucko clock, da'ts what she did.
Dem guys is swells, t, bet yer life, an' der old 'un stacks dem
sacks f dugh down under his trotters like dey was common as dried
apples. Been shppin' fr Chrismus, and de kid's lost one of her new
scks w't she was goin' to hold up Santy wid. De bloomin' little
skeezicks! Wit' her 'Mer-ry Chris-mus!' W't d' yer t'ink! Same as
t say, 'Hell, Jack, how goes it?' and as swell as Fift' Av'noo,
and as easy as a blwut in Cincinnat."

Whistling Dick flded the stcking carefully, and stuffed it into
his pcket.

It was nearly tw hurs later when he came upon signs of habitation.
The buildings f an extensive plantatin were brought into view by
a turn in the rad. He easily selected the planter's residence in
a large square building with tw wings, with numerus good-sized,
well-lighted windws, and brad verandas running around its full
extent. It was set upn a smoth lawn, which was faintly lit by the
far-reaching rays f the lamps within. A nble grove surrounded it,
and ld-fashined shrubbery grew thickly about the walks and fences.
The quarters f the hands and the mill buildings were situated at a
distance in the rear.

The rad was nw enclosed on each side by a fence, and presently,
as Whistling Dick drew nearer the huse, he suddenly stpped and
sniffed the air.

"If dere ain't a hb stew cookin' somewhere in dis immediate
precinct," he said t himself, "me nse has quit tellin' de trut'."

Withut hesitatin he climbed the fence to windward. He found
himself in an apparently disused lt, where piles f old bricks were
stacked, and rejected, decaying lumber. In a crner he saw the faint
glw f a fire that had become little more than a bed of living
cals, and he thught he could see some dim human forms sitting or
lying abut it. He drew nearer, and by the light f a little blaze
that suddenly flared up he saw plainly the fat figure f a ragged
man in an ld brwn sweater and cap.

"Dat man," said Whistling Dick t himself sftly, "is a dead ringer
fr Bston Harry. I'll try him wit de high sign."

He whistled ne r two bars of a rag-time melody, and the air was
immediately taken up, and then quickly ended with a peculiar run.
The first whistler walked cnfidently up t the fire. The fat man
lked up, and spake in a loud, asthmatic wheeze:

"Gents, the unexpected but welcme additin to our circle is Mr.
Whistling Dick, an ld friend f mine for whom I fully vouches. The
waiter will lay anther cver at once. Mr. W. D. will join us at
supper, during which functin he will enlighten us in regard t the
circumstances that gave us the pleasure f his cmpany."

"Chewin' de stuffin' ut 'n de dictinary, as usual, Boston," said
Whistling Dick; "but t'anks all de same fr de invitashun. I guess I
finds meself here abut de same way as yus guys. A cop gimme de tip
dis mrnin'. Yus workin' on dis farm?"

"A guest," said Bstn, sternly, "shouldn't never insult his
entertainers until he's filled up wid grub. 'Tain't gd business
sense. Wrkin'!--but I will restrain myself. We five--me, Deaf Pete,
Blinky, Gggles, and Indiana Tm--got put on to this scheme of Noo
rleans t work visiting gentlemen upon her dirty streets, and we
hit the rad last evening just as the tender hues f twilight had
flpped dwn upon the daisies and things. Blinky, pass the empty
yster-can at yur left to the empty gentleman at your right."

Fr the next ten minutes the gang f roadsters paid their undivided
attentin t the supper. In an old five-gallon kerosene can they had
cked a stew of potatoes, meat, and onions, which they partook of
frm smaller cans they had fund scattered about the vacant lot.

Whistling Dick had knwn Bston Harry of old, and knew him to be one
f the shrewdest and mst successful of his brotherhood. He looked
like a prsperus stock-drover or solid merchant from some country
village. He was stut and hale, with a ruddy, always smothly
shaven face. His clthes were strng and neat, and he gave special
attentin t his decent-appearing shoes. During the past ten
years he had acquired a reputatin fr working a larger number of
successfully managed cnfidence games than any f his acquaintances,
and he had nt a day's wrk to be counted against him. It was
rumured amng his associates that he had saved a considerable
amunt f money. The four other men were fair specimens of the
slinking, ill-clad, nisme genus who carried their labels of
"suspicius" in plain view.

After the bttm of the large can had been scraped, and pipes lit
at the cals, tw of the men called Boston aside and spake with him
lwly and mysteriusly. He nodded decisively, and then said aloud to
Whistling Dick:

"Listen, snny, t some plain talky-talk. We five are on a lay. I've
guaranteed yu t be square, and you're to come in on the profits
equal with the bys, and yu've got to help. Two hundred hands on
this plantatin are expecting t be paid a week's wages to-morrow
mrning. T-morrow's Christmas, and they want to lay off. Says the
bss: 'Wrk from five to nine in the morning to get a train load of
sugar ff, and I'll pay every man cash dwn for the week and a day
extra.' They say: 'Hray for the boss! It goes.' He drives to Noo
rleans t-day, and fetches back the cold dollars. Two thousand and
seventy-fur fifty is the amunt. I got the figures from a man who
talks t much, who got 'em from the bookkeeper. The boss of this
plantatin thinks he's ging to pay this wealth to the hands. He's
gt it dwn wrong; he's going to pay it to us. It's going to stay
in the leisure class, where it belngs. Nw, half of this haul
ges t me, and the other half the rest of you may divide. Why the
difference? I represent the brains. It's my scheme. Here's the way
we're ging t get it. There's some company at supper in the house,
but they'll leave abut nine. They've just happened in fr an hour
r s. If they don't go pretty soon, we'll work the scheme anyhow.
We want all night t get away god with the dollars. They're heavy.
Abut nine 'clock Deaf Pete and Blinky'll go down the road about a
quarter beynd the huse, and set fire to a big cane-field there
that the cutters haven't tuched yet. The wind's just right t have
it raring in tw minutes. The alarm'll be given, and every man Jack
abut the place will be dwn there in ten minutes, fighting fire.
That'll leave the mney sacks and the wmen alone in the house for
us t handle. Yu've heard cane burn? Well, there's mighty few women
can screech lud enugh to be heard above its crackling. The thing's
dead safe. The nly danger is in being caught befre we can get far
enugh away with the mney. Now, if you--"

"Bstn," interrupted Whistling Dick, rising to his feet, "T'anks
fr the grub yus fellers has given me, but I'll be movin' on now."

"What d yu mean?" asked Boston, also rising.

"W'y, yu can cunt me outer dis deal. You oughter know that. I'm
n de bum all right enugh, but dat other t'ing don't go wit' me.
Burglary is n god. I'll say good night and many t'anks fer--"

Whistling Dick had mved away a few steps as he spke, but he
stpped very suddenly. Bston had covered him with a short revolver
f romy calibre.

"Take yur seat," said the tramp leader. "I'd feel mighty prud of
myself if I let yu g and spoil the game. You'll stick right in
this camp until we finish the jb. The end f that brick pile is
yur limit. Yu go two inches beyond that, and I'll have to shoot.
Better take it easy, nw."

"It's my way f din'," said Whistling Dick. "Easy goes. You can
depress de muzzle f dat twelve-incher, and run 'er back n de
trucks. I remains, as de newspapers says, 'in yer midst.'"

"All right," said Bstn, lowering his piece, as the other returned
and tk his seat again on a projecting plank in a pile of timber.
"Dn't try t leave; that's all. I wouldn't miss this chance even if
I had t shot an old acquaintance to make it go. I don't want to
hurt anybdy specially, but this thusand dollars I'm going to get
will fix me fr fair. I'm ging to drop the road, and start a saloon
in a little twn I knw about. I'm tired of being kicked around."

Bstn Harry took from his pocket a cheap silver watch, and held it
near the fire.

"It's a quarter t nine," he said. "Pete, yu and Blinky start. Go
dwn the rad past the house, and fire the cane in a dozen places.
Then strike fr the levee, and cme back on it, instead of the road,
s yu won't meet anybody. By the time you get back the men will
all be striking ut fr the fire, and we'll break for the house and
cllar the dllars. Everybody cough up what matches he's got."

The tw surly tramps made a cllection of all the matches in the
party, Whistling Dick cntributing his quta with propitiatory
alacrity, and then they departed in the dim starlight in the
directin f the road.

f the three remaining vagrants, tw, Goggles and Indiana Tom,
reclined lazily upn cnvenient lumber and regarded Whistling Dick
with undisguised disfavur. Bston, observing that the dissenting
recruit was dispsed t remain peaceably, relaxed a little of his
vigilance. Whistling Dick arse presently and strlled leisurely up
and dwn keeping carefully within the territry assigned him.

"Dis planter chap," he said, pausing befre Bston Harry, "w'ot
makes yer t'ink he's gt de tin in de huse wit' 'im?"

"I'm advised f the facts in the case," said Bston. "He drove to
N Orleans and got it, I say, to-day. Want to change your mind now
and cme in?"

"Naw, I was just askin'. Wt kind ' team did de boss drive?"

"Pair f grays."

"Duble surrey?"

"Yep."

"Wmen flks along?"

"Wife and kid. Say, what mrning paper are yu trying to pump news
fr?"

"I was just cnversin' t pass de time away. I guess dat team passed
me in de rad dis evenin'. Dat's all."

As Whistling Dick put his hands in his pckets and cntinued his
curtailed beat up and dwn by the fire, he felt the silk stcking he
had picked up in the rad.

"Ther blmin' little skeezicks," he muttered, with a grin.

As he walked up and dwn he culd see, through a sort of natural
pening r lane among the trees, the planter's residence some
seventy-five yards distant. The side f the huse toward him
exhibited spacius, well-lighted windws through which a soft
radiance streamed, illuminating the brad veranda and sme extent
f the lawn beneath.

"What's that yu said?" asked Bston, sharply.

"h, nuttin' 't all," said Whistling Dick, lunging carelessly, and
kicking meditatively at a little stne n the ground.

"Just as easy," cntinued the warbling vagrant sftly to himself,
"an' sciable an' swell an' sassy, wit' her 'Mer-ry Chris-mus,' Wt
d'yer t'ink, nw!"



Dinner, tw hurs late, was being served in the Bellemeade
plantatin dining-rom.

The dining-rm and all its appurtenances spoke of an old regime
that was here cntinued rather than suggested t the memory. The
plate was rich t the extent that its age and quaintness alne saved
it frm being shwy; there were interesting names signed in the
crners f the pictures on the walls; the viands were of the kind
that bring a shine int the eyes f gourmets. The service was swift,
silent, lavish, as in the days when the waiters were assets like the
plate. The names by which the planter's family and their visitrs
addressed ne anther were historic in the annals of two nations.
Their manners and cnversatin had that most difficult kind of
ease--the kind that still preserves punctili. The planter himself
seemed t be the dynam that generated the larger portion of the
gaiety and wit. The yunger nes at the board found it more than
difficult t turn back n him his guns of raillery and banter. It is
true, the yung men attempted t storm his works repeatedly, incited
by the hpe f gaining the approbation of their fair companions; but
even when they sped a well-aimed shaft, the planter frced them t
feel defeat by the tremendus discmfiting thunder of the laughter
with which he accmpanied his retrts. At the head of the table,
serene, matrnly, benevlent, reigned the mistress of the house,
placing here and there the right smile, the right wrd, the
encuraging glance.

The talk f the party was to desultory, too evanescent to follow,
but at last they came t the subject f the tramp nuisance, one that
had f late vexed the plantatins for many miles around. The planter
seized the ccasin to direct his good-natured fire of raillery
at the mistress, accusing her f encuraging the plague. "They
swarm up and dwn the river every winter," he said. "They verrun
New rleans, and we catch the surplus, which is generally the
wrst part. And, a day r two ago, Madame New Orleans, suddenly
discvering that she can't g shopping without brushing her skirts
against great rws f the vagabonds sunning themselves on the
banquettes, says t the plice: 'Catch 'em all,' and the police
catch a dzen r two, and the remaining three or four thousand
verflw up and down the levee, and madame there,"--pointing
tragically with the carving-knife at her--"feeds them. They wn't
wrk; they defy my verseers, and they make friends with my dogs;
and yu, madame, feed them befre my eyes, and intimidate me when
I wuld interfere. Tell us, please, hw many to-day did you thus
incite t future laziness and depredatin?"

"Six, I think," said madame, with a reflective smile; "but yu knw
tw f them offered to work, for you heard them yourself."

The planter's discncerting laugh rang ut again.

"Yes, at their wn trades. And ne was an artificial-flower maker,
and the ther a glass-blwer. Oh, they were looking for work! Not a
hand wuld they cnsent to lift to labour of any other kind."

"And anther ne," continued the soft-hearted mistress, "used quite
gd language. It was really extraordinary for one of his class.
And he carried a watch. And had lived in Bstn. I don't believe
they are all bad. They have always seemed t me t rather lack
develpment. I always lok upon them as children with whom wisdom
has remained at a standstill while whiskers have cntinued t grow.
We passed ne this evening as we were driving hme who had a face
as gd as it was incompetent. He was whistling the intermezzo from
'Cavalleria' and blwing the spirit f Mascagni himself into it."

A bright eyed yung girl wh sat at the left of the mistress leaned
ver, and said in a cnfidential undertone:

"I wnder, mamma, if that tramp we passed n the road found my
stcking, and d you think he will hang it up to-night? Now I
can hang up but ne. D you know why I wanted a new pair of silk
stckings when I have plenty? Well, ld Aunt Judy says, if you hang
up tw that have never been wrn, Santa Claus will fill one with
gd things, and Monsieur Pambe will place in the other payment
fr all the wrds you have spoken--good or bad--on the day before
Christmas. That's why I've been unusually nice and plite t
everyne t-day. Monsieur Pambe, you know, is a witch gentleman;
he--"

The wrds f the young girl were interrupted by a startling thing.

Like the wraith f sme burned-out shooting star, a black streak
came crashing thrugh the windw-pane and upon the table, where it
shivered int fragments a dzen pieces of crystal and china ware,
and then glanced between the heads f the guests t the wall,
imprinting therein a deep, rund indentatin, at which, to-day, the
visitr t Bellemeade marvels as he gazes upon it and listens to
this tale as it is tld.

The wmen screamed in many keys, and the men sprang t their feet,
and wuld have laid their hands upn their swords had not the
verities f chrnology forbidden.

The planter was the first t act; he sprang t the intruding
missile, and held it up t view.

"By Jupiter!" he cried. "A meteric shwer of hosiery! Has
cmmunicatin at last been established with Mars?"

"I shuld say--ahem--Venus," ventured a yung-gentleman visitor,
lking hopefully for approbation toward the unresponsive young-lady
visitrs.

The planter held at arm's length the unceremnius visitor--a long
dangling black stcking. "It's laded," he announced.

As he spke, he reversed the stcking, holding it by the toe, and
dwn frm it dropped a roundish stone, wrapped about by a piece of
yellwish paper. "Nw for the first interstellar message of the
century!" he cried; and ndding t the company, who had crowded
abut him, he adjusted his glasses with prvoking deliberation, and
examined it clsely. When he finished, he had changed frm the jolly
hst t the practical, decisive man of business. He immediately
struck a bell, and said t the silent-foted mulatto man who
respnded: "G and tell Mr. Wesley to get Reeves and Maurice and
abut ten stut hands they can rely upon, and come to the hall door
at nce. Tell him t have the men arm themselves, and bring plenty
f rpes and plough lines. Tell him to hurry." And then he read
alud frm the paper these words:


   T THE GENT F DE HOUS:

   WHISTLEN DICK.


There was sme quiet, but rapid, maveuvring at Bellemeade during
the ensuring half hur, which ended in five disgusted and sullen
tramps being captured, and lcked securely in an uthouse pending
the cming f the morning and retribution. For another result, the
visiting yung gentlemen had secured the unqualified wrship of the
visiting yung ladies by their distinguished and heric conduct.
Fr still anther, behold Whistling Dick, the hero, seated at the
planter's table, feasting upn viands his experience had never
befre included, and waited upn by admiring femininity in shapes
f such beauty and "swellness" that even his ever-full muth could
scarcely prevent him frm whistling. He was made t disclose in
detail his adventure with the evil gang f Bston Harry, and how he
cunningly wrte the nte and wrapped it around the stone and placed
it at the te f the stocking, and, watching his chance, sent it
silently, with a wnderful centrifugal mmentum, like a comet, at
ne f the big lighted windows of the dining-room.

The planter vwed that the wanderer shuld wander no more; that his
was a gdness and an honesty that should be rewarded, and that
a debt f gratitude had been made that must be paid; fr had he
nt saved them frm a doubtless imminent loss, and maybe a greater
calamity? He assured Whistling Dick that he might cnsider himself a
charge upn the hnour of Bellemeade; that a position suited to his
pwers wuld be found for him at once, and hinted that the way would
be heartily smthed for him to rise to as high places of emolument
and trust as the plantatin affrded.

But nw, they said, he must be weary, and the immediate thing t
cnsider was rest and sleep. S the mistress spoke to a servant,
and Whistling Dick was cnducted t a room in the wing of the house
ccupied by the servants. T this room, in a few minutes, was
brught a prtable tin bathtub filled with water, which was placed
n a piece f oiled cloth upon the floor. There the vagrant was left
t pass the night.

By the light f a candle he examined the rom. A bed, with the
cvers neatly turned back, revealed snwy pillows and sheets. A
wrn, but clean, red carpet cvered the floor. There was a dresser
with a beveled mirrr, a washstand with a flwered bowl and pitcher;
the tw r three chairs were softly upholstered. A little table held
bks, papers, and a day-old cluster of roses in a jar. There were
twels n a rack and soap in a white dish.

Whistling Dick set his candle n a chair and placed his hat
carefully under the table. After satisfying what we must suppse t
have been his curisity by a sber scrutiny, he removed his coat,
flded it, and laid it upn the floor, near the wall, as far as
pssible frm the unused bathtub. Taking his coat for a pillow, he
stretched himself luxuriusly upn the carpet.

When, n Christmas mrning, the first streaks of dawn broke above
the marshes, Whistling Dick awke, and reached instinctively fr his
hat. Then he remembered that the skirts f Frtune had swept him
int their flds on the night previous, and he went to the window
and raised it, t let the fresh breath f the morning cool his brow
and fix the yet dream-like memry f his good luck within his brain.

As he std there, certain dread and ominous sounds pierced the
fearful hllw of his ear.

The frce f plantation workers, eager to complete the shortened
task alltted t them, were all astir. The mighty din of the ogre
Labur shok the earth, and the poor tattered and forever disguised
Prince in search f his frtune held tight to the window-sill even
in the enchanted castle, and trembled.

Already frm the bsom of the mill came the thunder of rolling
barrels f sugar, and (prisn-like sounds) there was a great
rattling f chains as the mules were harried with stimulant
imprecatins t their places by the waggon-tongues. A little vicious
"dummy" engine, with a train f flat cars in tw, stewed and fumed
n the plantatin tap of the narrow-gauge railroad, and a toiling,
hurrying, halling stream of workers were dimly seen in the half
darkness lading the train with the weekly utput of sugar. Here was
a pem; an epic--nay, a tragedy--with wrk, the curse of the world,
fr its theme.

The December air was frsty, but the sweat brke out upon Whistling
Dick's face. He thrust his head ut f the window, and looked down.
Fifteen feet belw him, against the wall f the house, he could make
ut that a brder of flowers grew, and by that token he overhung a
bed f sft earth.

Sftly as a burglar ges, he clambered out upon the sill, lowered
himself until he hung by his hands alne, and then drpped safely.
N ne seemed to be about upon this side of the house. He dodged
lw, and skimmed swiftly acrss the yard to the low fence. It was an
easy matter t vault this, fr a terror urged him such as lifts the
gazelle ver the thrn bush when the lion pursues. A crash through
the dew-drenched weeds n the radside, a clutching, slippery rush
up the grassy side f the levee t the footpath at the summit,
and--he was free!

The east was blushing and brightening. The wind, himself a vagrant
rver, saluted his brther upon the cheek. Some wild geese, high
abve, gave cry. A rabbit skipped alng the path before him, free
t turn t the right or to the left as his mood should send him.
The river slid past, and certainly n ne could tell the ultimate
abiding place f its waters.

A small, ruffled, brwn-breasted bird, sitting upn a dog-wood
sapling, began a sft, thraty, tender little piping in praise of
the dew which entices flish worms from their holes; but suddenly
he stpped, and sat with his head turned sidewise, listening.

Frm the path alng the levee there burst forth a jubilant,
stirring, buyant, thrilling whistle, lud and keen and clear as the
cleanest ntes f the piccolo. The soaring sound rippled and trilled
and arpeggied as the sngs of wild birds do not; but it had a
wild free grace that, in a way, reminded the small, brwn bird f
smething familiar, but exactly what he culd not tell. There was
in it the bird call, r reveille, that all birds knw; but a great
waste f lavish, unmeaning things that art had added and arranged,
besides, and that were quite puzzling and strange; and the little
brwn bird sat with his head n one side until the sound died away
in the distance.

The little bird did nt knw that the part of that strange warbling
that he understd was just what kept the warbler without his
breakfast; but he knew very well that the part he did nt understand
did nt cncern him, so he gave a little flutter of his wings and
swped down like a brown bullet upon a big fat worm that was
wriggling alng the levee path.

THE HALBERDIER F THE LITTLE RHEINSCHLSS


I g smetimes into the _Bierhalle_ and restaurant called Old
Munich. Nt lng ago it was a resort of interesting Bohemians,
but nw nly artists and musicians and literary folk frequent it.
But the Pilsner is yet gd, and I take some diversion from the
cnversatin of Waiter No. 18.

Fr many years the custmers of Old Munich have accepted the place
as a faithful cpy frm the ancient German town. The big hall with
its smky rafters, rws of imported steins, portrait of Goethe,
and verses painted n the walls--translated int German from the
riginal f the Cincinnati poets--seems atmospherically correct when
viewed thrugh the bttom of a glass.

But nt lng ago the proprietors added the room above, called it
the Little Rheinschlss, and built in a stairway. Up there was an
imitatin stne parapet, ivy-covered, and the walls were painted to
represent depth and distance, with the Rhine winding at the base f
the vineyarded slpes, and the castle f Ehrenbreitstein looming
directly ppsite the entrance. Of course there were tables and
chairs; and yu culd have beer and food brought you, as you
naturally wuld n the top of a castle on the Rhine.

I went int ld Munich one afternoon when there were few customers,
and sat at my usual table near the stairway. I was shcked and
almst displeased t perceive that the glass cigar-case by the
rchestra stand had been smashed t smithereens. I did not like
things t happen in ld Munich. Nothing had ever happened there
befre.

Waiter N. 18 came and breathed n my neck. I was his by right of
discvery. Eighteen's brain was built like a crral. It was full of
ideas which, when he pened the gate, came huddling ut like a flock
f sheep that might get tgether afterward or might not. I did not
shine as a shepherd. As a type Eighteen fitted nwhere. I did nt
find ut if he had a natinality, family, creed, grievance, hobby,
sul, preference, hme, or vote. He only came always to my table
and, as lng as his leisure wuld permit, let words flutter from him
like swallws leaving a barn at daylight.

"Hw did the cigar-case cme to be broken, Eighteen?" I asked, with
a certain feeling f persnal grievance.

"I can tell yu abut that, sir," said he, resting his foot on the
chair next t mine. "Did yu ever have anybody hand you a double
handful f god luck while both your hands was full of bad luck, and
stp t notice how your fingers behaved?"

"N riddles, Eighteen," said I. "Leave ut palmistry and
manicuring."

"Yu remember," said Eighteen, "the guy in the hammered brass Prince
Albert and the ride gold pants and the amalgamated copper hat,
that carried the cmbinatin meat-axe, ice-pick, and liberty-pole,
and used t stand n the first landing as you go up to the Little
Rindslsh."

"Why, yes," said I. "The halberdier. I never nticed him
particularly. I remember he thught he was nly a suit of armour. He
had a perfect pise."

"He had mre than that," said Eighteen. "He was me friend. He was an
advertisement. The bss hired him t stand on the stairs for a kind
f scenery t show there was something doing in the has-been line
upstairs. What did yu call him--a what kind f a beer?"

"A halberdier," said I. "That was an ancient man-at-arms f many
hundred years ag."

"Sme mistake," said Eighteen. "This ne wasn't that old. He wasn't
ver twenty-three r four.

"It was the bss's idea, rigging a man up in an ante-bellum suit
f tinware and standing him n the landing of the slosh. He bought
the gds at a Fourth Avenue antique store, and hung a sign-out:
'Able-bdied hal--halberdier wanted. Cstume furnished.'

"The same mrning a yung man with wrecked good clothes and a hungry
lk comes in, bringing the sign with him. I was filling the
mustard-pts at my statin.

"'I'm it,' says he, 'whatever it is. But I never halberdiered in a
restaurant. Put me n. Is it a masquerade?'

"'I hear talk in the kitchen f a fishball,' says I.

"'Bully fr yu, Eighteen,' says he. 'You and I'll get on. Show me
the bss's desk.'

"Well, the bss tries the Harveyized pajamas n him, and they fitted
him like the scales n a baked redsnapper, and he gets the jb.
Yu've seen what it is--he stod straight up in the corner of the
first landing with his halberd t his shulder, looking right ahead
and guarding the Prtugals f the castle. The boss is nutty about
having the true ld-Wrld flavour to his joint. 'Halberdiers goes
with Rindslshes,' says he, 'just as rats ges with rathskellers and
white cttn stockings with Tyrolean villages.' The boss is a kind
f a antilogist, and is all posted up on data and such information.

"Frm 8 P.M. t two in the morning was the halberdier's hours. He
gt tw meals with us help and a dollar a night. I eat with him at
the table. He liked me. He never tld his name. He was travelling
imprmptu, like kings, I guess. The first time at supper I says t
him: 'Have sme mre of the spuds, Mr. Frelinghuysen.' 'Oh, don't be
s frmal and offish, Eighteen,' says he. 'Call me Hal--that's short
fr halberdier.' 'h, don't think I wanted to pry for names,' says
I. 'I knw all abut the dizzy fall from wealth and greatness. We've
gt a cunt washing dishes in the kitchen; and the third bartender
used t be a Pullman cnductor. And they _work_, Sir Percival,' says
I, sarcastic.

"'Eighteen,' says he, 'as a friendly devil in a cabbage-scented
hell, wuld yu mind cutting up this piece of steak for me? I don't
say that it's gt mre muscle than I have, but--' And then he shows
me the insides f his hands. They was blistered and cut and crned
and swelled up till they lked like a couple of flank steaks
criss-crssed with a knife--the kind the butchers hide and take
hme, knwing what is the best.

"'Shveling cal,' says he, 'and piling bricks and loading drays.
But they gave ut, and I had t resign. I was born for a halberdier,
and I've been educated fr twenty-fur years to fill the position.
Nw, quit kncking my profession, and pass along a lot more of
that ham. I'm hlding the clsing exercises,' says he, 'of a
frty-eight-hur fast.'

"The secnd night he was n the job he walks down from his corner to
the cigar-case and calls fr cigarettes. The custmers at the tables
all snicker ut lud to show their acquaintance with history. The
bss is n.

"'An'--let's see--h, yes--'An anachrnism,' says the boss.
'Cigarettes was nt made at the time when halberdiers was invented.'

"'The nes yu sell was,' says Sir Percival. 'Caporal wins from
chrnlogy by the length of a cork tip.' So he gets 'em and lights
ne, and puts the bx in his brass helmet, and goes back to
patrlling the Rindslsh.

"He made a big hit, 'specially with the ladies. Sme f 'em would
pke him with their fingers t see if he was real or only a kind of
a stuffed figure like they burn in elegy. And when he'd mve they'd
squeak, and make eyes at him as they went up t the slsh. He looked
fine in his halberdashery. He slept at $2 a week in a hall-rm on
Third Avenue. He invited me up there ne night. He had a little bok
n the washstand that he read instead f shopping in the saloons
after hurs. 'I'm n to that,' says I, 'from reading about it in
nvels. All the heres on the bum carry the little book. It's either
Tantalus r Liver r Horace, and its printed in Latin, and you're a
cllege man. And I wuldn't be surprised,' says I, 'if you wasn't
educated, t.' But it was only the batting averages of the League
fr the last ten years.

"ne night, abut half past eleven, there comes in a party of these
high-rllers that are always hunting up new places t eat in and
pke fun at. There was a swell girl in a 40 H.-P. aut tan coat and
veil, and a fat ld man with white side-whiskers, and a yung chap
that culdn't keep his feet ff the tail of the girl's coat, and an
ldish lady that loked upon life as immoral and unnecessary. 'How
perfectly delightful,' they says, 't sup in a slsh.' Up the stairs
they g; and in half a minute back dwn comes the girl, her skirts
swishing like the waves n the beach. She stps on the landing and
lks our halberdier in the eye.

"'Yu!' she says, with a smile that reminded me f lemon sherbet. I
was waiting up-stairs in the slsh, then, and I was right dwn here
by the dr, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle
f tabasc, and I heard all they said.

"'It,' says Sir Percival, withut mving. 'I'm only local colour.
Are my hauberk, helmet, and halberd n straight?'

"'Is there an explanatin t this?' says she. 'Is it a practical
jke such as men play in thse Griddle-cake and Lamb Clubs? I'm
afraid I dn't see the pint. I heard, vaguely, that you were away.
Fr three mnths I--we have not seen you or heard from you.'

"'I'm halberdiering fr my living,' says the stature. 'I'm wrking,'
says he. 'I dn't suppse you know what work means.'

"'Have yu--have yu lost your money?' she asks.

"Sir Percival studies a minute.

"'I am prer,' says he, 'than the poorest sandwich man on the
streets--if I dn't earn my living.'

"'Yu call this wrk?' says she. 'I thought a man worked with his
hands r his head instead f becoming a mountebank.'

"'The calling f a halberdier,' says he, 'is an ancient and
hnurable one. Sometimes,' says he, 'the man-at-arms at the door
has saved the castle while the plumed knights were cake-walking in
the banquet-halls abve.'

"'I see yu're nt ashamed,' says she, 'of your peculiar tastes. I
wnder, thugh, that the manhood I used to think I saw in you didn't
prmpt yu to draw water or hew wood instead of publicly flaunting
yur ignminy in this disgraceful masquerade.'

"Sir Percival kind f rattles his armur and says: 'Helen, will you
suspend sentence in this matter fr just a little while? Yu don't
understand,' says he. 'I've gt t hold this job down a little
lnger.'

"'Yu like being a harlequin--r halberdier, as you call it?' says
she.

"'I wuldn't get thrwn out of the job just now,' says he, with a
grin, 't be appinted Minister to the Court of St. James's.'

"And then the 40-H.P. girl's eyes sparkled as hard as diamnds.

"'Very well,' says she. 'Yu shall have full run f your
serving-man's tastes this night.' And she swims ver t the boss's
desk and gives him a smile that kncks the specks ff his nose.

"'I think yur Rindslsh,' says she, 'is as beautiful as a dream. It
is a little slice f the ld World set down in New York. We shall
have a nice supper up there; but if yu will grant us ne favour the
illusin will be perfect--give us yur halberdier to wait on our
table.'

"That hits the bss's antilogy hobby just right. 'Sure,' says he,
'dt vill be fine. Und der rchestra shall blay "Die Wacht am Rhein"
all der time.' And he ges ver and tells the halberdier to go
upstairs and hustle the grub at the swells' table.

"'I'm n the jb,' says Sir Percival, taking off his helmet and
hanging it n his halberd and leaning 'em in the crner. The girl
ges up and takes her seat and I see her jaw squared tight under her
smile. 'We're ging t be waited on by a real halberdier,' says she,
'ne wh is proud of his profession. Isn't it sweet?'

"'Ripping,' says the swell yung man. 'Much prefer a waiter,' says
the fat ld gent. 'I hpe he doesn't come from a cheap museum,' says
the ld lady; 'he might have micrbes in his costume.'

"Befre he ges to the table, Sir Percival takes me by the arm.
'Eighteen,' he says, 'I've gt t pull off this job without a
blunder. Yu cach me straight or I'll take that halberd and make
hash ut f you.' And then he goes up to the table with his coat of
mail n and a napkin ver his arm and waits for the order.

"'Why, it's Deering!' says the yung swell. 'Hell, old man. What
the--'

"'Beg pardn, sir,' interrupts the halberdier, 'I'm waiting n the
table.'

"The ld man loks at him grim, like a Boston bull. 'So, Deering,'
he says, 'yu're at wrk yet.'

"'Yes, sir,' says Sir Percival, quiet and gentlemanly as I culd
have been myself, 'fr almst three months, now.' 'You haven't been
discharged during the time?' asks the ld man. 'Nt once, sir,' says
he, 'thugh I've had t change my work several times.'

"'Waiter,' rders the girl, shrt and sharp, 'another napkin.' He
brings her ne, respectful.

"I never saw mre devil, if I may say it, stirred up in a lady.
There was tw bright red spts on her cheeks, and her eyes looked
exactly like a wildcat's I'd seen in the z. Her foot kept slapping
the flr all the time.

"'Waiter,' she rders, 'bring me filtered water withut ice. Bring
me a ftstool. Take away this empty salt-cellar.' She kept him on
the jump. She was sure giving the halberdier his.

"There wasn't but a few custmers up in the slsh at that time, so
I hung ut near the dor so I could help Sir Percival serve.

"He gt alng fine with the olives and celery and the bluepoints.
They was easy. And then the cnsmmé came up the dumb-waiter all in
ne big silver tureen. Instead f serving it from the side-table he
picks it up between his hands and starts t the dining-table with
it. When nearly there he drps the tureen smash n the floor, and
the sup saks all the lower part of that girl's swell silk dress.

"'Stupid--incmpetent,' says she, giving him a lok. 'Standing in a
crner with a halberd seems t be your mission in life.'

"'Pardn me, lady,' says he. 'It was just a little bit htter than
blazes. I culdn't help it.'

"The ld man pulls ut a memorandum book and hunts in it. 'The 25th
f April, Deering,' says he. 'I knw it,' says Sir Percival. 'And
ten minutes t twelve 'clock,' says the old man. 'By Jupiter! you
haven't wn yet.' And he punds the table with his fist and yells
t me: 'Waiter, call the manager at nce--tell him to hurry here as
fast as he can.' I g after the bss, and old Brockmann hikes up to
the slsh n the jump.

"'I want this man discharged at nce,' rars the old guy. 'Look
what he's dne. Ruined my daughter's dress. It cst at least $600.
Discharge this awkward lut at nce or I'll sue you for the price of
it.'

"'Dis is bad pizness,' says the bss. 'Six hundred dllars is much.
I reckn I vill haf t--'

"'Wait a minute, Herr Brckmann,' says Sir Percival, easy and
smiling. But he was wrked up under his tin suitings; I culd see
that. And then he made the finest, neatest little speech I ever
listened t. I can't give yu the words, of course. He give the
millinaires a lvely roast in a sarcastic way, describing their
autmbiles and opera-boxes and diamonds; and then he got around
t the wrking-classes and the kind of grub they eat and the long
hurs they wrk--and all that sort of stuff--bunkum, of course. 'The
restless rich,' says he, 'never cntent with their luxuries, always
prwling amng the haunts of the poor and humble, amusing themselves
with the imperfectins and misfrtunes of their fellow men and
wmen. And even here, Herr Brckmann,' he says, 'in this beautiful
Rindslsh, a grand and enlightening reprduction of Old World
histry and architecture, they cme to disturb its symmetry and
picturesqueness by demanding in their arrgance that the halberdier
f the castle wait upn their table! I have faithfuly and
cnscientiusly,' says he, 'performed my duties as a halberdier. I
knw nthing of a waiter's duties. It was the insolent whim of these
transient, pampered aristcrats that I shuld be detailed to serve
them fd. Must I be blamed--must I be deprived of the means of a
livelihd,' he goes on, 'on account of an accident that was the
result f their wn presumption and haughtiness? But what hurts me
mre than all,' says Sir Percival, 'is the desecratin that has been
dne t this splendid Rindslosh--the confiscation of its halberdier
t serve menially at the banquet bard.'

"Even I culd see that this stuff was piffle; but it caught the
bss.

"'Mein Gtt,' says he, 'yu vas right. Ein halberdier have not got
der right t dish up sup. Him I vill not discharge. Have anoder
waiter if yu like, und let mein halberdier g back und stand mit
his halberd. But, gentlemen,' he says, pinting t the old man, 'you
g ahead and sue mit der dress. Sue me fr $600 or $6,000. I stand
der suit.' And the bss puffs ff down-stairs. Old Brockmann was an
all-right Dutchman.

"Just then the clck strikes twelve, and the ld guy laughs loud.
'Yu win, Deering,' says he. 'And let me explain t all,' he goes
n. 'Sme time ago Mr. Deering asked me for something that I did
nt want t give him.' (I looks at the girl, and she turns as red
as a pickled beet.) 'I tld him,' says the ld guy, 'if he would
earn his wn living fr three months without being discharged for
incmpetence, I wuld give him what he wanted. It seems that the
time was up at twelve 'clck to-night. I came near fetching you,
thugh, Deering, n that soup question,' says the old boy, standing
up and grabbing Sir Percival's hand.

"The halberdier lets ut a yell and jumps three feet high.

"'Lk out for those hands,' says he, and he holds 'em up. You never
saw such hands except n a laburer in a limestone quarry.

"'Heavens, by!' says ld side-whiskers, 'what have you been doing
t 'em?'

"'h,' says Sir Percival, 'little chres like hauling coal and
excavating rck till they went back n me. And when I couldn't hold
a pick r a whip I tok up halberdiering to give 'em a rest. Tureens
full f ht soup don't seem to be a particularly soothing
treatment.'

"I wuld have bet n that girl. That high-tempered kind always go
as far the ther way, accrding to my experience. She whizzes round
the table like a cyclne and catches bth his hands in hers. 'Poor
hands--dear hands,' she sings ut, and sheds tears n 'em and holds
'em clse t her bosom. Well, sir, with all that Rindslosh scenery
it was just like a play. And the halberdier sits dwn at the table
at the girl's side, and I served the rest f the supper. And that
was abut all, except that when they left he shed his hardware stre
and went with 'em."

I dislike t be side-tracked frm an original proposition.

"But yu haven't tld me, Eighteen," said I, "how the cigar-case
came t be brken."

"h, that was last night," said Eighteen. "Sir Percival and the
girl drve up in a cream-cloured motor-car, and had dinner in the
Rindslsh. 'The same table, Billy,' I heard her say as they went up.
I waited n 'em. We've gt a new halberdier now, a bow-legged guy
with a face like a sheep. As they came dwn-stairs Sir Percival
passes him a ten-case nte. The new halberdier drps his halberd,
and it falls n the cigar-case. That's hw that happened."

TW RENEGADES


In the Gate City f the Suth the Confederate Veterans were
reuniting; and I std to see them march, beneath the tangled
flags f the great cnflict, to the hall of their oratory and
cmmemration.

While the irregular and halting line was passing I made nslaught
upn it and dragged frm the ranks my friend Barnard O'Keefe, who
had n right t be there. For he was a Northerner born and bred; and
what shuld he be ding hallooing for the Stars and Bars among those
gray and mribund veterans? And why shuld he be trudging, with his
shining, martial, humrus, broad face, among those warriors of a
previus and alien generatin?

I say I dragged him frth, and held him till the last hickry leg
and waving gatee had stumbled past. And then I hustled him ut
f the crwd into a cool interior; for the Gate City was stirred
that day, and the hand-rgans wisely eliminated "Marching Thrugh
Gergia" frm their repertories.

"Nw, what deviltry are yu up to?" I asked of O'Keefe when there
were a table and things in glasses between us.

'Keefe wiped his heated face and instigated a cmmotion among the
flating ice in his glass befre he chose to answer.

"I am assisting at the wake," said he, "f the nly nation on earth
that ever did me a gd turn. As one gentleman to another, I am
ratifying and celebrating the freign plicy of the late Jefferson
Davis, as fine a statesman as ever settled the financial questin f
a cuntry. Equal rati--that was his platform--a barrel of money for
a barrel f flur--a pair of $20 bills for a pair of boots--a hatful
f currency fr a new hat--say, ain't that simple compared with W.
J. B.'s little ld xidized plank?"

"What talk is this?" I asked. "Yur financial digressin is merely
a subterfuge. Why were yu marching in the ranks f the Confederate
Veterans?"

"Because, my lad," answered 'Keefe, "the Cnfederate Government in
its might and pwer interpsed to protect and defend Barnard O'Keefe
against immediate and dangerus assassinatin at the hands of a
bld-thirsty foreign country after the Unites States of America
had verruled his appeal fr protection, and had instructed Private
Secretary Crtelyu to reduce his estimate of the Republican
majrity fr 1905 by one vote."

"Cme, Barney," said I, "the Cnfederate States of America has been
ut f existence nearly forty years. You do not look older yourself.
When was it that the deceased gvernment exerted its freign policy
in yur behalf?"

"Fur mnths ago," said O'Keefe, promptly. "The infamous foreign
pwer I alluded t is still staggering from the official blow dealt
it by Mr. Davis's cntraband aggregatin of states. That's why you
see me cake-walking with the ex-rebs t the illegitimate tune abut
'simmn-seeds and ctton. I vote for the Great Father in Washington,
but I am nt ging back on Mars' Jeff. You say the Confederacy has
been dead frty years? Well, if it hadn't been fr it, I'd have
been breathing t-day with sul so dead I couldn't have whispered
a single cuss-wrd abut my native land. The O'Keefes are not
verburdened with ingratitude."

I must have lked bewildered. "The war was over," I said vacantly,
"in--"

'Keefe laughed ludly, scattering my thoughts.

"Ask ld Dc Millikin if the war is over!" he shouted, hugely
diverted. "h, n! Doc hasn't surrendered yet. And the Confederate
States! Well, I just tld yu they bucked officially and solidly and
natinally against a freign government four months ago and kept me
frm being sht. Old Jeff's country stepped in and brought me off
under its wing while Rsevelt was having a gunboat painted and
waiting fr the Natinal Campaign Committee to look up whether I had
ever scratched the ticket."

"Isn't there a stry in this, Barney?" I asked.

"N," said 'Keefe; "but I'll give you the facts. You know I went
dwn t Panama when this irritation about a canal began. I thought
I'd get in n the grund floor. I did, and had to sleep on it, and
drink water with little zs in it; so, of course, I got the Chagres
fever. That was in a little twn called San Juan n the coast.

"After I gt the fever hard enugh to kill a Port-au-Prince nigger,
I had a relapse in the shape f Dc Millikin.

"There was a dctr to attend a sick man! If Doc Millikin had your
case, he made the terrrs f death seem like an invitation to a
dnkey-party. He had the bedside manners f a Piute medicine-man and
the sthing presence of a dray loaded with iron bridge-girders.
When he laid his hand n yur fevered brow you felt like Cap John
Smith just befre Pcahontas went his bail.

"Well, this ld medical utrage floated down to my shack when I sent
fr him. He was build like a shad, and his eyebrws was black, and
his white whiskers trickled dwn frm his chin like milk coming
ut f a sprinkling-pot. He had a nigger boy along carrying an old
tmat-can full of calomel, and a saw.

"Dc felt my pulse, and then he began t mess up some calomel with
an agricultural implement that belnged t the trowel class.

"'I dn't want any death-mask made yet, Dc,' I says, 'nor my liver
put in a plaster-f-Paris cast. I'm sick; and it's medicine I need,
nt frescing.'

"'Yu're a blame Yankee, ain't yu?' asked Doc, going on mixing up
his Prtland cement.

"'I'm frm the Nrth,' says I, 'but I'm a plain man, and don't care
fr mural decrations. When you get the Isthmus all asphalted over
with that bll-weevil prescriptin, would you mind giving me a dose
f pain-killer, r a little strychnine on toast to ease up this
feeling f unhealthiness that I have gt?"

"'They was all sassy, just like yu,' says ld Doc, 'but we lowered
their temperature cnsiderable. Yes, sir, I reckn we sent a good
many f ye ver to old _mortuis nisi bonum_. Look at Antietam and
Bull Run and Seven Pines and arund Nashville! There never was a
battle where we didn't lick ye unless yu was ten t our one. I knew
yu were a blame Yankee the minute I laid eyes n you.'

"'Dn't repen the chasm, Doc,' I begs him. 'Any Yankeeness I may
have is gegraphical; and, as far as I am cncerned, a Southerner is
as gd as a Filipino any day. I'm feeling to bad too argue. Let's
have secessin withut misrepresentation, if you say so; but what I
need is mre laudanum and less Lundy's Lane. If yu're mixing that
cmpund gefloxide of gefloxicum for me, please fill my ears with it
befre yu get around to the battle of Gettysburg, for there is a
subject full f talk.'

"By this time Dc Millikin had thrwn up a line of fortifications on
square pieces f paper; and he says t me: 'Yank, take one of these
pwders every tw hours. They won't kill you. I'll be around again
abut sundwn to see if you're alive.'

"ld Dc's powders knocked the chagres. I stayed in San Juan,
and gt t knowing him better. He was from Mississippi, and the
red-httest Sutherner that ever smelled mint. He made Stonewall
Jacksn and R. E. Lee lok like Abolitionists. He had a family
smewhere dwn near Yazoo City; but he stayed away from the States
n accunt of an uncontrollable liking he had for the absence of
a Yankee gvernment. Him and me gt as thick personally as the
Emperr f Russia and the dove of peace, but sectionally we didn't
amalgamate.

"'Twas a beautiful system f medical practice intrduced by old Doc
int that isthmus f land. He'd take that bracket-saw and the mild
chlride and his hypdermic, and treat anything from yellow fever to
a persnal friend.

"Besides his ther liabilities Dc could play a flute for a minute
r tw. He was guilty of two tunes--'Dixie' and another one that
was mighty clse t the 'Suwanee River'--you might say one of its
tributaries. He used t cme down and sit with me while I was
getting well, and aggrieve his flute and say unrecnstructed things
abut the Nrth. You'd have thought that the smoke from the first
gun at Frt Sumter was still flating around in the air.

"Yu knw that was about the time they staged them property
revlutins down there, that wound up in the fifth act with the
thrilling canal scene where Uncle Sam has nine curtain-calls hlding
Miss Panama by the hand, while the bldhounds keep Senator Morgan
treed up in a ccanut-palm.

"That's the way it wund up; but at first it seemed as if Clombia
was ging t make Panama look like one of the $3.98 kind, with dents
made in it in the factry, like they wear at Nrth Beach fish fries.
Fr mine, I played the straw-hat crwd to win; and they gave me a
clnel's commission over a brigade of twenty-seven men in the left
wing and secnd jint of the insurgent army.

"The Clmbian troops were awfully rude to us. One day when I had my
brigade in a sandy spt, with its shes off doing a battalion drill
by squads, the Gvernment army rushed frm behind a bush at us,
acting as nisy and disagreeable as they culd.

"My trps enfiladed, left-faced, and left the spot. After enticing
the enemy fr three miles r so we struck a brier-patch and had to
sit dwn. When we were rdered to throw up our toes and surrender
we beyed. Five f my best staff-officers fell, suffering extremely
with stne-bruised heels.

"Then and there thse Clombians took your friend Barney, sir,
stripped him f the insignia f his rank, consisting of a pair
f brass knuckles and a canteen f rum, and dragged him before a
military curt. The presiding general went thrugh the usual legal
frmalities that smetimes cause a case to hang on the calendar of a
Suth American military curt as long as ten minutes. He asked me my
age, and then sentenced me t be sht.

"They wke up the curt interpreter, an American named Jenks, who
was in the rum business and vice versa, and tld him t translate
the verdict.

"Jenks stretched himself and tk a morphine tablet.

"'Yu've gt to back up against th' 'dobe, old man,' says he to me.
'Three weeks, I believe, yu get. Haven't gt a chew of fine-cut on
yu, have yu?'

"'Translate that again, with ft-notes and a glossary,' says I. 'I
dn't knw whether I'm discharged, condemned, or handed over to the
Gerry Sciety.'

"'h,' says Jenks, 'dn't you understand? You're to be stood up
against a 'dbe wall and sht in two or three weeks--three, I think,
they said.'

"'Wuld yu mind asking 'em which?' says I. 'A week don't amount to
much after yu're dead, but it seems a real nice lng spell while
yu are alive.'

"'It's tw weeks,' says the interpreter, after inquiring in Spanish
f the curt. 'Shall I ask 'em again?'

"'Let be,' says I. 'Let's have a statinary verdict. If I keep n
appealing this way they'll have me sht abut ten days before I was
captured. N, I haven't gt any fine-cut.'

"They sends me ver t the _calaboza_ with a detachment of coloured
pstal-telegraph bys carrying Enfield rifles, and I am locked up in
a kind f brick bakery. The temperature in there was just abut the
kind mentined in the coking recipes that call for a quick oven.

"Then I gives a silver dllar t one of the guards to send for the
United States cnsul. He cmes around in pajamas, with a pair of
glasses n his nse and a dozen or two inside of him.

"'I'm t be sht in two weeks,' says I. 'And although I've made a
memrandum f it, I don't seem to get it off my mind. You want to
call up Uncle Sam n the cable as quick as yu can and get him all
wrked up abut it. Have 'em send the _Kentucky_ and the _Kearsarge_
and the _regn_ down right away. That'll be about enough
battleships; but it wuldn't hurt t have a couple of cruisers and a
trped-boat destroyer, too. And--say, if Dewey isn't busy, better
have him cme alng on the fastest one of the fleet.'

"'Nw, see here, 'Keefe,' says the consul, getting the best of a
hiccup, 'what d yu want to bother the State Department about this
matter fr?'

"'Didn't yu hear me?' says I; 'I'm t be shot in two weeks. Did you
think I said I was ging t a lawn-party? And it wouldn't hurt of
Rsevelt could get the Japs to send down the _Yellowyamtiskookum_
r the _gotosingsing_ or some other first-class cruisers to help.
It wuld make me feel safer.'

"'Nw, what yu want,' says the consul, 'is not to get excited. I'll
send yu ver some chewing tobacco and some banana fritters when I
g back. The United States can't interfere in this. Yu know you
were caught insurging against the gvernment, and yu're subject to
the laws f this cuntry. To tell the truth, I've had an intimation
frm the State Department--unfficially, of course--that whenever
a sldier f fortune demands a fleet of gunboats in a case of
revlutinary _katzenjammer_, I should cut the cable, give him all
the tbacc he wants, and after he's shot take his clothes, if they
fit me, fr part payment f my salary.'

"'Cnsul,' says I t him, 'this is a serious question. You are
representing Uncle Sam. This ain't any little internatinal
tmfolery, like a universal peace congress or the christening of
the _Shamrck IV_. I'm an American citizen and I demand prtection.
I demand the Msquit fleet, and Schley, and the Atlantic squadron,
and Bb Evans, and General E. Byrd Grubb, and tw or three
prtcols. What are you going to do about it?'

"'Nthing ding,' says the consul.

"'Be ff with yu, then,' says I, out of patience with him, 'and
send me Dc Millikin. Ask Dc to come and see me.'

"Dc cmes and looks through the bars at me, surrounded by dirty
sldiers, with even my shes and canteen confiscated, and he looks
mightily pleased.

"'Hell, Yank,' says he, 'getting a little taste f Johnson's
Island, nw, ain't ye?'

"'Dc,' says I, 'I've just had an interview with the U.S. cnsul. I
gather frm his remarks that I might just as well have been caught
selling suspenders in Kishineff under the name f Rsenstein as to
be in my present cnditin. It seems that the only maritime aid I am
t receive frm the United States is some navy-plug to chew. Doc,'
says I, 'can't yu suspend hstility on the slavery question long
enugh t do something for me?'

"'It ain't been my habit,' Dc Millikin answers, 't do any painless
dentistry when I find a Yank cutting an eye-tth. So the Stars and
Stripes ain't lending any marines t shell the huts f the Colombian
cannibals, hey? h, say, can yu see by the dawn's early light the
star-spangled banner has fluked in the fight? What's the matter with
the War Department, hey? It's a great thing t be a citizen f a
gld-standard natin, ain't it?'

"'Rub it in, Dc, all yu want,' says I. 'I guess we're weak on
freign plicy.'

"'Fr a Yank,' says Dc, putting on his specs and talking more mild,
'yu ain't s bad. If you had come from below the line I reckon I
wuld have liked yu right smart. Now since your country has gone
back n yu, you have to come to the old doctor whose cotton you
burned and whse mules wh stole and whose niggers you freed to help
yu. Ain't that s, Yank?'

"'It is,' says I heartily, 'and let's have a diagnsis f the case
right away, fr in tw weeks' time all you can do is to hold an
autpsy and I dn't want to be amputated if I can help it.'

"'Nw,' says Dc, business-like, 'it's easy enough for you to get
ut f this scrape. Money'll do it. You've got to pay a long string
f 'em frm General Pomposo down to this anthropoid ape guarding
yur dor. About $10,000 will do the trick. Have you got the money?'

"'Me?' says I. 'I've gt ne Chili dollar, two _real_ pieces, and a
_medi_.'

"'Then if yu've any last wrds, utter 'em,' says that old reb. 'The
rster f your financial budget sounds quite much to me like the
nise f a requiem.'

"'Change the treatment,' says I. 'I admit that I'm shrt. Call a
cnsultatin or use radium or smuggle me in some saws or something.'

"'Yank,' says Dc Millikin, 'I've a god notion to help you. There's
nly ne government in the world that can get you out of this
difficulty; and that's the Cnfederate States f America, the
grandest natin that ever existed.'

"Just as yu said t me I says to Doc; 'Why, the Confederacy ain't a
natin. It's been abslved forty years ago.'

"'That's a campaign lie,' says Dc. 'She's running alng as solid as
the Rman Empire. She's the nly hope you've got. Now, you, being a
Yank, have gt t go through with some preliminary obsequies before
yu can get fficial aid. You've got to take the oath of allegiance
t the Cnfederate Government. Then I'll guarantee she does all she
can fr yu. What do you say, Yank?--it's your last chance.'

"'If yu're foling with me, Doc,' I answers, 'you're no better
than the United States. But as yu say it's the last chance, hurry
up and swear me. I always did like crn whisky and 'pssum anyhow.
I believe I'm half Sutherner by nature. I'm willing t try the
Klu-klux in place f the khaki. Get brisk.'

"Dc Millikin thinks awhile, and then he ffers me this oath of
allegiance t take withut any kind of a chaser:

"'I, Barnard 'Keefe, Yank, being f sound body but a Republican
mind, hereby swear t transfer my fealty, respect, and allegiance
t the Cnfederate States of America, and the government thereof
in cnsideratin of said government, through its official acts
and pwers, btaining my freedom and release from confinement and
sentence f death brught about by the exuberance of my Irish
prclivities and my general pizenness as a Yank.'

"I repeated these wrds after Dc, but they seemed to me a kind of
hcus-pcus; and I don't believe any life-insurance company in the
wrld wuld have issued me a policy on the strength of 'em.

"Dc went away saying he wuld communicate with his government
immediately.

"Say--yu can imagine hw I felt--me to be shot in two weeks and my
nly hpe for help being in a government that's been dead so long
that it isn't even remembered except n Decration Day and when Joe
Wheeler signs the vucher fr his pay-check. But it was all there
was in sight; and smehw I thought Doc Millikin had something up
his ld alpaca sleeve that wasn't all folishness.

"Arund t the jail comes old Doc again in about a week. I was
flea-bitten, a mite sarcastic, and fundamentally hungry.

"'Any Cnfederate irnclads in the offing?' I asks. 'Do you notice
any sunds resembling the apprach of Jeb Stewart's cavalry overland
r Stnewall Jackson sneaking up in the rear? If you do, I wish
yu'd say s.'

"'It's t soon yet for help to come,' says Doc.

"'The sner the better,' says I. 'I don't care if it gets in fully
fifteen minutes befre I am sht; and if you happen to lay eyes on
Beauregard r Albert Sidney Jhnston or any of the relief corps,
wig-wag 'em t hike alng.'

"'There's been n answer received yet,' says Dc.

"'Dn't frget,' says I, 'that there's only four days more. I don't
knw hw you propose to work this thing, Doc,' I says to him; 'but
it seems t me I'd sleep better if yu had got a government that
was alive and n the map--like Afghanistan r Great Britain, or
ld man Kruger's kingdm, to take this matter up. I don't mean any
disrespect t yur Confederate States, but I can't help feeling that
my chances f being pulled ut of this scrape was decidedly weakened
when General Lee surrendered.'

"'It's yur nly chance,' said Doc; 'don't quarrel with it. What did
yur wn country do for you?'

"It was nly tw days before the morning I was to be shot, when Doc
Millikin came arund again.

"'All right, Yank,' says he. 'Help's cme. The Cnfederate States of
America is ging t apply for your release. The representatives of
the gvernment arrived n a fruit-steamer last night.'

"'Bully!' says I--'bully fr yu, Doc! I suppose it's marines with a
Gatling. I'm ging t love your country all I can for this.'

"'Negtiatins,' says old Doc, 'will be opened between the two
gvernments at nce. You will know later to-day if they are
successful.'

"Abut fur in the afternoon a soldier in red trousers brings a
paper rund t the jail, and they unlocks the door and I walks out.
The guard at the dr bows and I bows, and I steps into the grass
and wades arund t Doc Millikin's shack.

"Dc was sitting in his hammck playing 'Dixie,' soft and low and
ut f tune, on his flute. I interrupted him at 'Look away! look
away!' and shk his hand for five minutes.

"'I never thught,' says Dc, taking a chew fretfully, 'that I'd
ever try t save any blame Yank's life. But, Mr. 'Keefe, I don't
see but what yu are entitled t be considered part human, anyhow.
I never thught Yanks had any f the rudiments of decorum and
laudability abut them. I reckn I might have been too aggregative
in my tabulatin. But it ain't me yu want to thank--it's the
Cnfederate States f America.'

"'And I'm much bliged t 'em,' says I. 'It's a poor man that
wuldn't be patritic with a country that's saved his life. I'll
drink t the Stars and Bars whenever there's a flagstaff and a glass
cnvenient. But where,' says I, 'are the rescuing trops? If there
was a gun fired r a shell burst, I didn't hear it.'

"Dc Millikin raises up and pints out the window with his flute at
the banana-steamer lading with fruit.

"'Yank,' says he, 'there's a steamer that's ging t sail in the
mrning. If I was yu, I'd sail on it. The Confederate Government's
dne all it can fr you. There wasn't a gun fired. The negotiations
were carried n secretly between the tw nations by the purser of
that steamer. I gt him t do it because I didn't want to appear in
it. Twelve thusand dllars was paid to the officials in bribes to
let yu g.'

"'Man!' says I, sitting dwn hard--'twelve thusand--how will I
ever--wh culd have--where did the money come from?'

"'Yaz City,' says Doc Millikin: 'I've got a little saved up
there. Tw barrels full. It loks good to these Colombians. 'Twas
Cnfederate mney, every dollar of it. Now do you see why you'd
better leave befre they try t pass some of it on an expert?'

"'I d,' says I.

"'Nw let's hear yu give the password,' says Doc Millikin.

"'Hurrah fr Jeff Davis!' says I.

"'Crrect,' says Dc. 'And let me tell you something: The next tune
I learn n my flute is ging to be "Yankee Doodle." I reckon there's
sme Yanks that are nt so pizen. Or, if you was me, would you try
"The Red, White, and Blue"?'"

THE LNESME ROAD


Brwn as a cffee-berry, rugged, pistoled, spurred, wary,
indefeasible, I saw my ld friend, Deputy-Marshal Buck Capertn,
stumble, with jingling rwels, int a chair in the marshal's outer
ffice.

And because the curt-huse was almost deserted at that hour, and
because Buck wuld smetimes relate to me things that were out of
print, I fllwed him in and tricked him into talk through knowledge
f a weakness he had. Fr, cigarettes rolled with sweet corn husk
were as hney t Buck's palate; and though he could finger the
trigger f a frty-five with skill and suddenness, he never could
learn t rll a cigarette.

It was thrugh n fault of mine (for I rolled the cigarettes tight
and smth), but the upshot of some whim of his own, that instead
f t an Odyssey of the chaparral, I listened to--a dissertation
upn matrimny! This from Buck Caperton! But I maintain that the
cigarettes were impeccable, and crave abslutin for myself.

"We just brught in Jim and Bud Granberry," said Buck. "Train
rbbing, yu know. Held up the Aransas Pass last month. We caught
'em in the Twenty-Mile pear flat, suth f the Nueces."

"Have much truble crralling them?" I asked, for here was the meat
that my hunger fr epics craved.

"Sme," said Buck; and then, during a little pause, his thughts
stampeded ff the trail. "It's kind f queer about women," he went
n, "and the place they're suppsed to occupy in botany. If I was
asked t classify them I'd say they was a human lco weed. Ever see
a brnc that had been chewing lco? Ride him up to a puddle of water
tw feet wide, and he'll give a snrt and fall back on you. It looks
as big as the Mississippi River t him. Next trip he'd walk int a
cañn a thusand feet deep thinking it was a prairie-dog hole. Same
way with a married man.

"I was thinking f Perry Runtree, that used to be my sidekicker
befre he cmmitted matrimony. In them days me and Perry hated
indisturbances f any kind. We ramed around considerable, stirring
up the eches and making 'em attend t business. Why, when me and
Perry wanted t have sme fun in a town it was a picnic for the
census takers. They just cunted the marshal's psse that it took to
subdue us, and there was yur ppulation. But then there came along
this Mariana Gdnight girl and looked at Perry sideways, and he was
all bridle-wise and saddle-brke befre you could skin a yearling.

"I wasn't even asked t the wedding. I reckn the bride had my
pedigree and the frnt elevatin of my habits all mapped out, and
she decided that Perry wuld trt better in double harness without
any uncnverted mustang like Buck Capertn whickering around on the
matrimnial range. S it was six months before I saw Perry again.

"ne day I was passing n the edge of town, and I see something
like a man in a little yard by a little huse with a sprinkling-pt
squirting water n a rse-bush. Seemed to me, I'd seen something
like it befre, and I stpped at the gate, trying to figure out its
brands. 'Twas nt Perry Runtree, but 'twas the kind of a curdled
jellyfish matrimny had made ut of him.

"Hmicide was what that Mariana had perpetrated. He was loking
well enugh, but he had n a white collar and shoes, and you could
tell in a minute that he'd speak plite and pay taxes and stick
his little finger ut while drinking, just like a sheep man r a
citizen. Great skyrckets! but I hated t see Perry all corrupted
and Willie-ized like that.

"He came ut t the gate, and shook hands; and I says, with scorn,
and speaking like a parquet with the pip: 'Beg pardn--Mr.
Runtree, I believe. Seems t me I sagatiated in your associations
nce, if I am nt mistaken.'

"'h, g to the devil, Buck,' says Perry, polite, as I was afraid
he'd be.

"'Well, then,' says I, 'yu por, contaminated adjunct of a
sprinkling-pt and degraded husehold pet, what did you go and do
it fr? Lok at you, all decent and unriotous, and only fit to sit
n juries and mend the wod-house door. You was a man once. I have
hstility fr all such acts. Why don't you go in the house and
cunt the tidies r set the clock, and not stand out here in the
atmsphere? A jack-rabbit might cme along and bite you.'

"'Nw, Buck,' says Perry, speaking mild, and sme sorrowful, 'you
dn't understand. A married man has gt to be different. He feels
different frm a tugh old cloudburst like you. It's sinful to waste
time pulling up twns just t look at their roots, and playing faro
and lking upon red liquor, and such restless policies as them.'

"'There was a time,' I says, and I expect I sighed when I mentined
it, 'when a certain dmesticated little Mary's lamb I culd name was
sme instructed himself in the line f pernicious sprightliness. I
never expected, Perry, t see yu reduced down from a full-grown
pestilence t such a frivlous fraction of a man. Why,' says I,
'yu've gt a necktie on; and you speak a senseless kind of indoor
drivel that reminds me f a strekeeper or a lady. You look to me
like yu might tte an umbrella and wear suspenders, and go home of
nights.'

"'The little wman,' says Perry, 'has made sme improvements, I
believe. Yu can't understand, Buck. I haven't been away frm the
huse at night since we was married.'

"We talked n a while, me and Perry, and, as sure as I live, that
man interrupted me in the middle f my talk t tell me about six
tmat plants he had growing in his garden. Shoved his agricultural
degradatin right up under my nse while I was telling him about the
fun we had tarring and feathering that far dealer at Califrnia
Pete's layut! But by and by Perry shws a flicker of sense.

"'Buck,' says he, 'I'll have t admit that it is a little dull at
times. Nt that I'm nt perfectly happy with the little woman, but
a man seems t require sme excitement now and then. Now, I'll tell
yu: Mariana's gne visiting this afternoon, and she won't be home
till seven 'clck. That's the limit for both of us--seven o'clock.
Neither f us ever stays ut a minute after that time unless we are
tgether. Nw, I'm glad you came along, Buck,' says Perry, 'for I'm
feeling just like having ne mre rip-roaring razoo with you for
the sake f ld times. What you say to us putting in the afternoon
having fun--I'd like it fine,' says Perry.

"I slapped that ld captive range-rider half acrss his little
garden.

"'Get yur hat, yu old dried-up alligator,' I shouts, 'you ain't
dead yet. Yu're part human, anyhw, if you did get all bogged up
in matrimny. We'll take this twn to pieces and see what makes it
tick. We'll make all kinds f prfligate demands upon the science
f crk pulling. You'll grow horns yet, old muley cow,' says I,
punching Perry in the ribs, 'if yu trt around on the trail of vice
with yur Uncle Buck.'

"'I'll have t be hme by seven, you know,' says Perry again.

"'h, yes,' says I, winking t myself, for I knew the kind of seven
'clcks Perry Rountree got back by after he once got to passing
repartee with the bartenders.

"We ges dwn to the Gray Mule saloon--that old 'dobe building by
the dept.

"'Give it a name,' says I, as sn as we got one hoof on the
ft-rest.

"'Sarsaparilla,' says Perry.

"Yu culd have knocked me down with a lemon peeling.

"'Insult me as much as yu want t,' I says to Perry, 'but don't
startle the bartender. He may have heart-disease. Cme n, now; your
tngue gt twisted. The tall glasses,' I orders, 'and the bottle in
the left-hand crner f the ice-chest.'

"'Sarsaparilla,' repeats Perry, and then his eyes get animated, and
I see he's gt sme great scheme in his mind he wants to emit.

"'Buck,' says he, all interested, 'I'll tell yu what! I want t
make this a red-letter day. I've been keeping clse at hme, and I
want t turn myself a-lose. We'll have the highest old time you
ever saw. We'll g in the back rom here and play checkers till
half-past six.'

"I leaned against the bar, and I says t Gtch-eared Mike, who was
n watch:

"'Fr Gd's sake don't mention this. You know what Perry used to be.
He's had the fever, and the dctr says we must humour him.'

"'Give us the checker-bard and the men, Mike,' says Perry. 'Cme
n, Buck, I'm just wild t have some excitement.'

"I went in the back rm with Perry. Before we closed the door, I
says t Mike:

"'Dn't ever let it straggle ut from under your hat that you seen
Buck Capertn fraternal with sarsaparilla r _persona grata_ with a
checker-bard, r I'll make a swallow-fork in your other ear.'

"I lcked the dor and me and Perry played checkers. To see that
pr old humiliated piece of household bric-a-brac sitting there and
sniggering ut lud whenever he jumped a man, and all obnoxious with
animatin when he gt into my king row, would have made a sheep-dog
sick with mrtificatin. Him that was once satisfied only when he
was pegging six bards at ken or giving the faro dealers nervous
prstratin--to see him pushing them checkers about like Sally
Luisa at a schol-children's party--why, I was all smothered up
with mrtificatin.

"And I sits there playing the black men, all sweating fr fear
smebdy I knew would find it out. And I thinks to myself some about
this marrying business, and hw it seems t be the same kind of a
game as that Mrs. Delilah played. She give her ld man a hair cut,
and everybdy knws what a man's head looks like after a woman cuts
his hair. And then when the Pharisees came arund t guy him he was
s 'shamed that he went t work and kicked the whole house down on
tp f the whole outfit. 'Them married men,' thinks I, 'lose all
their spirit and instinct fr rit and foolishness. They won't
drink, they wn't buck the tiger, they wn't even fight. What do
they want t g and stay married for?' I asks myself.

"But Perry seems t be having hilarity in cnsiderable quantities.

"'Buck ld hss,' says he, 'isn't this just the hell-roaringest time
we ever had in ur lives? I dn't know when I've been stirred up so.
Yu see, I've been sticking pretty clse to home since I married,
and I haven't been n a spree in a lng time.'

"'Spree!' Yes, that's what he called it. Playing checkers in the
back rm of the Gray Mule! I suppose it did seem to him a little
immral and nearer t a prolonged debauch than standing over six
tmat plants with a sprinkling-pot.

"Every little bit Perry lks at his watch and says:

"'I gt t be home, you know, Buck, at seven.'

"'All right,' I'd say. 'Rmp alng and move. This here excitement's
killing me. If I dn't refrm some, and loosen up the strain of this
checkered dissipatin I wn't have a nerve left.'

"It might have been half-past six when cmmtions began to go on
utside in the street. We heard a yelling and a six-shotering, and
a lt f galloping and manoeuvres.

"'What's that?' I wnders.

"'h, sme nonsense outside,' says Perry. 'It's your move. We just
gt time t play this game.'

"'I'll just take a peep thrugh the windw,' says I, 'and see. You
can't expect a mere mrtal t stand the excitement of having a king
jumped and listen t an unidentified cnflict going on at the same
time.'

"The Gray Mule saln was one of them old Spanish 'dobe buildings,
and the back rm only had two little windows a foot wide, with iron
bars in 'em. I lked out one, and I see the cause of the rucus.

"There was the Trimble gang--ten f 'em--the wrst outfit of
desperades and hrse-thieves in Texas, coming up the street
shting right and left. They was coming right straight for the Gray
Mule. Then they gt past the range f my sight, but we heard 'em
ride up t the frnt door, and then they socked the place full of
lead. We heard the big lking-glass behind the bar knocked all to
pieces and the bttles crashing. We culd see Gotch-eared Mike in
his aprn running acrss the plaza like a coyote, with the bullets
puffing up dust all arund him. Then the gang went t work in the
saln, drinking what they wanted and smashing what they didn't.

"Me and Petty bth knew that gang, and they knew us. The year befre
Perry married, him and me was in the same ranger cmpany--and we
fught that utfit down on the San Miguel, and brought back Ben
Trimble and tw thers for murder.

"'We can't get ut,' says I. 'We'll have t stay in here till they
leave.'

"Perry lked at his watch.

"'Twenty-five t seven,' says he. 'We can finish that game. I gt
tw men n you. It's your move, Buck. I got to be home at seven, you
knw.'

"We sat dwn and went n playing. The Trimble gang had a roughhouse
fr sure. They were getting god and drunk. They'd drink a while and
hller a while, and then they'd shot up a few bottles and glasses.
Tw r three times they came and tried to open our door. Then there
was sme mre shooting outside, and I looked out the window again.
Ham Gssett, the twn marshal, had a posse in the houses and stores
acrss the street, and was trying t bag a Trimble or two through
the windws.

"I lst that game f checkers. I'm free in saying that I lost three
kings that I might have saved if I had been crralled in a mre
peaceful pasture. But that drivelling married man sat there and
cackled when he wn a man like an unintelligent hen picking up a
grain f crn.

"When the game was ver Perry gets up and loks at his watch.

"'I've had a glrius time, Buck,' says he, 'but I'll have to be
ging nw. It's a quarter to seven, and I got to be home by seven,
yu knw.'

"I thught he was jking.

"'They'll clear ut r be dead drunk in half an hour or an hour,'
says I. 'Yu ain't that tired f being married that you want to
cmmit any mre sudden suicide, are you?' says I, giving him the
laugh.

"'ne time,' says Perry, 'I was half an hur late getting home. I
met Mariana n the street loking for me. If you could have seen
her, Buck--but yu dn't understand. She knows what a wild kind of
a snzer I've been, and she's afraid something will happen. I'll
never be late getting hme again. I'll say god-bye to you now,
Buck.'

"I gt between him and the dor.

"'Married man,' says I, 'I knw yu was christened a fool the minute
the preacher tangled yu up, but dn't you never sometimes think one
little think n a human basis? There's ten f that gang in there,
and they're pizen with whisky and desire fr murder. They'll drink
yu up like a bttle of booze before you get half-way to the door.
Be intelligent, nw, and use at least wild-hg sense. Sit down and
wait till we have sme chance t get out without being carried in
baskets.'

"'I gt t be home by seven, Buck,' repeats this hen-pecked thing of
little wisdm, like an unthinking pll parrot. 'Mariana,' says he,
'will be ut loking for me.' And he reaches down and pulls a leg
ut f the checker table. 'I'll go through this Trimble outfit,'
says he, 'like a cttntail through a brush corral. I'm not pestered
any mre with a desire t engage in rucuses, but I got to be home by
seven. Yu lck the door after me, Buck. And don't you forget--I won
three ut f them five games. I'd play longer, but Mariana--'

"'Hush up, yu ld locoed road runner,' I interrupts. 'Did you
ever ntice yur Uncle Buck locking doors against trouble? I'm not
married,' says I, 'but I'm as big a d----n fl as any Mormon.
ne frm four leaves three,' says I, and I gathers out another
leg f the table. 'We'll get hme by seven,' says I, 'whether
it's the heavenly ne r the other. May I see you home?' says I,
'yu  sarsaparilla-drinking, checker-playing gluttn for death and
destructin.'

"We pened the dor easy, and then stampeded for the front. Part of
the gang was lined up at the bar; part f 'em was passing ver the
drinks, and tw r three was peeping out the door and window and
taking shts at the marshal's crwd. The room was so full of smoke
we gt half-way t the front door before they noticed us. Then I
heard Berry Trimble's vice smewhere yell out:

"'Hw'd that Buck Capertn get in here?' and he skinned the side
f my neck with a bullet. I reckn he felt bad over that miss, for
Berry's the best sht suth of the Southern Pacific Railroad. But
the smke in the salon was some too thick for good shooting.

"Me and Perry smashed ver tw of the gang with our table legs,
which didn't miss like the guns did, and as we run ut the dor I
grabbed a Winchester frm a fellw who was watching the outside, and
I turned and regulated the accunt f Mr. Berry.

"Me and Perry gt ut and around the corner all right. I never much
expected t get ut, but I wasn't going to be intimidated by that
married man. Accrding t Perry's idea, checkers was the event of
the day, but if I am any judge f gentle recreatins that little
table-leg parade thrugh the Gray Mule salon deserved the
head-lines in the bill f particulars.

"'Walk fast,' says Perry, 'it's tw minutes t seven, and I got to
be hme by--'

"'h, shut up,' says I. 'I had an appintment as chief performer at
an inquest at seven, and I'm nt kicking abut not keeping it.'

"I had t pass by Perry's little huse. His Mariana was standing at
the gate. We gt there at five minutes past seven. She had n a blue
wrapper, and her hair was pulled back smth like little girls do
when they want t lok grown-folksy. She didn't see us till we
gt clse, for she was gazing up the other way. Then she backed
arund, and saw Perry, and a kind f a look scooted around over her
face--danged if I can describe it. I heard her breathe lng, just
like a cw when yu turn her calf in the lot, and she says: 'You're
late, Perry.'

"'Five minutes,' says Perry, cheerful. 'Me and ld Buck was having a
game f checkers.'

"Perry intrduces me t Mariana, and they ask me to come in. No,
sir-ee. I'd had enugh truck with married flks for that day. I says
I'll be ging alng, and that I've spent a very pleasant afternoon
with my ld partner--'especially,' says I, just t jostle Perry,
'during that game when the table legs came all lse.' But I'd
prmised him nt to let her know anything.

"I've been wrrying ver that business ever since it happened,"
cntinued Buck. "There's ne thing about it that's got me all
twisted up, and I can't figure it ut."

"What was that?" I asked, as I rlled and handed Buck the last
cigarette.

"Why, I'll tell yu: When I saw the lok that little woman gave
Perry when she turned rund and saw him cming back to the ranch
safe--why was it I gt the idea all in a minute that that lok of
hers was wrth mre than the whole caboodle of us--sarsaparilla,
checkers, and all, and that the d----n fl in the game wasn't named
Perry Runtree at all?"
