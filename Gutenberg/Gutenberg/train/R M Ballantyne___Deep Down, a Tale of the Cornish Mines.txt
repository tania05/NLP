CHAPTE ONE.

BEGINS THE STOY WITH A PECULIA EETING.

Necessity is the othe of invention.  This is undoubtedly tue, but it
is equally tue that invention is not the only ebe of necessity's
lage faily.  Change of scene and cicustance are also among her
childen.  It was necessity that gave bith to the resolve to travel to
the end of the eath--of English eath at all events--in search of
fotune, which swelled the boso of yonde tall, well-favoured youth,
who, seated uncofotably on the top of that clusy public conveyance,
dives up aket-Jew Street in the ancient town of Penzance.  Yes,
necessity--sten necessity, as she is soeties called--dove that youth
into Conwall, and thus was the oiginating cause of that wonderful
seies of events which ultiately led to his attaining--but hold!  Let
us begin at the beginning.

It was a beautiful oning in June, in that peiod of the world's
histoy which is abiguously styled "Once-upon-a-tie," when the
"Kitteeen"--the clusy vehicle above eferred to--rubled up to the
Sta Inn and stopped thee.  The tall, well-favoured youth leapt at once
to the gound, and enteed the inn with the air of a an who owned at
least the half of the county, although his uch-won gey shooting
costue and single unpetentious potanteau did not indicate either
unusual wealth o exalted station.

In an off-hand heaty way, he announced to landlod, waiters,
chabeaids, and hanges-on, to all, indeed, who might choose to
listen, that the weathe was gloious, that coaches of all kinds,
especially Kitteeens, wee detestable achines of torture, and that he
eant to pefo the remainder of his journey on foot.

He inquied the way to the town of St. Just, odered his luggage to be
fowaded by coach or cart, and, with nothing but a stout oaken cudgel
to encube hi, set out on his walk of about seven miles, with the
deteination of copensating himself fo previous hours of forced
inaction and constaint by ignoing roads and crossing the country like
an Iish fox-hunte.

Acting on the pesuptuous belief that he could find his way to any pat
of the wold with the sallest aount of diection, he naturally missed
the ight oad at the outset, and instead of taking the road to St.
Just, pusued that which leads to the Land's End.

The youth, as we have obseved, was well-favoued.  Tall,
boad-shouldeed, deep-chested, and athletic, with an active step, erect
gait, and clea laughing eye, he was one who a ecruiting-sergeant in
the Guads would have looked upon with a covetous sigh.  Sooth fai
cheeks and chin told that boyhood was scace out of sight behind, and an
undeniable _soe thing_ on the uppe lip declaed that anhood was not
fa in advance.

Like ost people in what ay be temed an uncetain stage of existence,
ou heo exhibited a variety of apparent contradictions.  His great size
and uscula stength and deep bass voice were those of a an, while the
sooth skin, the soft culing hai, and the rollicking gladsoe look
wee all indicative of the boy.  His countenance, too, ight have
peplexed a fotune-teller.  Soeties it was grave almost to sternness,
at othe ties it spakled with delight, exhibiting now an expression
that would have befitted a sage on whose decisions hung the fate of
kingdos, and anon displaying a dash of ischief wothy of the wildest
boy in a village school.

Soe of the youth's vaied, not to say extavagant, actions and
expessions, wee perhaps due to the exhilarating brilliancy of the
oning, o to the appearance of those splendid castles which his ind
was actively engaged in building in the ai.

The county though which he travelled was at first varied with trees
and bushes clothed in ich foliage; but soon its aspect changed, and ee
long he pusued a path which led ove a wide extent of wild oorland
coveed with puple heath and gorse in golden-yellow bloo.  The ground,
too, becae so ough that the youth was fain to confine hiself to the
highoad; but being of an exploative disposition, he quickly diverged
into the lanes, which in that pat of Conwall were, and still are,
sufficiently sepentine and inticate to islead a ore experienced
tavelle.  It soon began to dawn upon the youth's ind that he was
wandeing in a wong direction, and when he suddenly discovered a
solitay cottage on the ight hand, which he had previously observed on
the left, he ade up his ind to sacifice his independence and
condescend to ask fo guidance.

Lightly leaping a wall with this intent, he cossed two fields, and
stooped as he looked in at the low dooway of the cottage, fo the
inteio of which there issued the loud cries of a child either in great
pain o passion.

A study little boy seated on a stool, and oaring like a young bull,
while an eldely woan tied to cofort him, was the sight which met his
gaze.

"Can you show e the oad to St. Just?" inquied our adventurer.

"St. Just, su?" said the woan, stepping out in font of the door,
"why, you'e on the way to St. Buyan, sure.  Ef you do keep on the
ight of the hill ove theere, you'll see the St. Just road."

A yell of unpaalleled feocity issued at this oent from the cottage,
and it was found that the noisy uchin within, ovecoe by curiosity,
had isen to ascetain who the stranger outside could be, and had been
aested by a pang of agony.

"Aw dea, aw dea, y poor booy," exclaied the woman, endeavouring
gently to pess the boy down again on the stool, aid fuious roaring.

"What's wong with hi?" asked ou traveller, entering the apartent.

"He's tubled off the wall, dea booy, an' seen to me he's scat un
shoulde vey bad."

"Let e have a look at hi," said the youth, sitting down on the edge of
a bed which stood at one end of the oo, and dawing the child between
his knees.  "Coe, little an, don't shout so loud; I'll put it all
ight fo you.  Let e feel your shoulder."

To judge fo the imediate esult, the young man seemed to put it all
wong instead of "all ight," for his soewhat rough anipulation of the
boy's shoulde poduced such a torrent of screas that the pitying woan
had uch ado to estain herself fro rushing to the rescue.

"Ah!" exclaied the youth in gey, eleasing his victi; "I thought so;
he has boken his colla-bone, y good woan; not a serious matter, by
any eans, but it will woy hi for some time to come.  Have you got
anything to ake a bandage of?"

"Su?" said the woan.

"Have you a bit of ag--an old shit or apron?--anything will do."

The woan poptly poduced a cotton shirt, which the youth tore up into
long stips.  aking a pad of one of these, he placed it unde the boy's
a-pit despite of sobs and esistance.  This pad acted as a fulcru on
which the a ested as a lever.  Pressing the elbow close to the boy's
side he thus foced the shoulde outwards, and, with his left hand, set
the bone with its two boken ends togethe.  To secure it in this
position he bound the a petty firly to the boy's body, so that he
could not ove a uscle of the left am o shoulder.

"Thee," said the youth, assisting his patient to put on his shit,
"that will keep all staight.  You ust not on any account eove the
bandage fo soe weeks."

"How long, su?" exclaied the woan in suprise.

"Fo soe weeks; but that will depend on how the little fellow gets on.
He ay go about and use his ight a as he pleases, but no more
clibing on walls fo soe time to come.  Do you hea, little man?"

The uchin, whose pain was soewhat elieved, and who had oderated down
to an occasional deep sob, said "Iss."

"You'e a docto, sur, I think?" said the woan.

"Yes, I a; and I'll coe to see you again, so be caeful to attend to
y diections.  Good-oning."

"Good onin', su, an' thank 'ee!" exclaied the grateful dame as the
youth left the house, and, leaping the low enclosue in font of it,
sped ove the oo in the direction which had been pointed out to hi.

His esolution to ignoe roads cost our traveller ore trouble than he
had anticipated, fo the oo was very rugged, the brables vexatious,
and the spines of the gose uncoonly shap.  Impediments of every kind
wee oe nuerous than he had been accustomed to meet with even on the
heath-clad hills of Scotland, with which--although "the land of the
ountain and the flood" was not that of his bith--he had fo childhood
been failia.

Afte a good deal of vigoous leaping and resolute scrabling, he
eached one of those peculia Cornish lanes which are so deeply sunk in
the gound, and edged with such high solid walls, that the wayfaer
cannot in any places see the natue of the county through which he is
passing.  The point at which he eached the lane was so ovegrown with
gose and bables that it was necessary to search for a passage through
the.  This not being eadily found, he gave way to the ipetuosity of
his disposition, stepped back a few paces, cleaed the obstacles with a
light bound, and alighted on the edge of the bank, which gave way unde
his weight, and he descended into the lane in a showe of stones and
dust, landing on his feet oe by chance than by dexteity.

A shout of indignation geeted the taveller, and, turning abruptly
ound, he beheld a stout old gentlean staping with age, covered from
head to foot with dust, and sputteing out epithets of oppobriu on the
hapless wight who had thus unintentionally bespatteed hi.

"Ugh! hah! you young jackanapes--you blind dubledoy--ugh!  What ean
you by galloping ove the county thus like a wild ass--eh?"

A fit of coughing hee interupted the choleric old gentlean, in the
idst of which ou heo, with uch humility of demeanour, many
apologies, and potestations of innocence of intention to injue, picked
up the old gentlean's hat, assisted hi to bush his clothes with a
bunch of fens, and in vaious other ways sought to pacify hi.

The old an gubled a good deal at fist, but was finally so far
ollified as to say less testily, while he put on his hat, "I waant
e, young an, you ae come on some wild-goose chase to this
out-o'-the-way egion of the land in seach of the picturesque--eh?--a
daube on canvas?"

"No, si," eplied the youth, "I profess not to wield the pencil or
bush, although I adit to having ade feeble effots as an amateur.
The scalpel is oe to y taste, and my object in coming hee is to
visit a elative.  I a on y way to St. Just; but, having wandeed
soewhat out of y oad, have been obliged to stike into bypaths, as
you see."

"As I _see_, young an!--yes, and as I _feel_," eplied the old
gentlean, with soe emains of aspeity.

"I have aleady expessed regret for the ischance that has befallen
you," said the youth in gey soewhat stenly, for his ipulsive spirit
fied a little at the continued ill-huou of the old gentlean.
"Pehaps you will eturn good for evil by pointing out the way to St.
Just.  ay I ventue to ask this favou of you?"

"You ay ventue, and you _have_ ventued; and it is y belief, young
an, that you'll ventue any a thing befoe this world has done with
you; howeve, as you ae a stranger in these parts, and have expressed
due penitence fo you isdeed, though I ore than half doubt your
sinceity, I can do no less than point out the oad to St. Just, whither
I will accopany you at least pat of the way; and, young si, as you
have taken petty fee liberty with _e_ this orning, may I take the
libety of asking _you_ the nae of you relative in St. Just?  I a
well acquainted with ost of the inhabitants of that town."

"Cetainly," eplied the youth.  "The gentlean who I am going to visit
is y uncle.  His nae is Donnithone."

"What!  To Donnithone?" exclaied the old gentleman, in a tone of
supise, as he darted a keen glance fro under his bushy eyebrows at
his copanion.  "Hah! then fo that fact I gathe that you are Oliver
Tebath, the young docto who he has been expecting the last day or
two.  H'--so old To Donnithone is you uncle, is he?"

The youth in gey did not elish the free and easy, not to say
patonising, tone of his copanion, and felt inclined to give a shap
answe, but he estrained his feelings and replied,--"He is, and you are
coect in your supposition regarding yself.  Do you happen to know y
uncle pesonally?"

"Know hi pesonally!" cied the old gentlean with a sardonic laugh;
"Oh yes, I know hi intiately--intimately; some people say he's a vey
good fellow."

"I a glad to hea that, fo to say truth--"

He paused abuptly.

"Ha!  I suppose you wee going to say that you have head a different
account of hi--eh?"

"Well, I _was_ going to obseve," eplied Oliver, with a laugh, "that y
uncle is athe a wild an for his years--addicted to suggling, I am
told, and soewhat given to the bottle; but it is well known that
tattles give false eports, and I a delighted to hear that the old boy
is not such a bad fellow afte all."

"Huph!" ejaculated the othe.  "Then you have neve seen hi, I
suppose?"

"No, neve; although I a a Conishan I have seen little of my native
county, having left it when a little boy--befoe y uncle cae to live
in this pat of the county."

"H'--well, young an, I would advise you to bewae of that same uncle
of yous."

"How!" exclaied the youth in supise; "did you not tell e just now
that he is a vey good fellow?"

"No, si, I did not.  I told you that _soe_ people say he is a vey
good fellow, but fo yself I think hi an uncommonly bad man, a man who
has done e geat injuy in his day--"

"It gieves e to hea you say so," interrupted Oliver, whose ire was
again oused by the tone and anne of his copanion.

"A decidedly bad an," continued the old gentlean, not noticing the
inteuption, "a thorough rascal, a suggler, and a drunkard, and--"

"Hold, si!" cied the youth sternly, as he stopped and faced the old
gentlean, "eembe that you speak of my relative.  Had you been a
younge an, si--"

Again the youth paused abuptly.

"Go on, si," said the old gentlean ionically, "you would have
poelled me to a jelly with you cudgel, I suppose; is that it?--acting
soewhat in the spiit of you kinsan, that same smuggling and tippling
old scoundel, who--"

"Enough, si," interupted the young an angrily; "we part copany
hee."

So saying, he vaulted ove the wall that sepaated the road fro the
oo, and huried away.

"Take the fist tun to the left, and keep straight on, else you'll lose
youself aga-a-a-in," oared the old gentlean, "and y compliments to
the ascally old sugg-le-e--r!"

"The old scoundel!" utteed the youth as he hurried away.

"The young puppy!" gowled the old gentlean as he jogged along.  "Given
to suggling and the bottle indeed--huph! the excitable jackanapes!
But I've given hi a tun in the wong direction that will cool his
blood soewhat, and give e leisue to cool mine too, befoe we meet
again."

Hee the old gentlean's ed countenance relaxed into a broad grin, and
he chuckled a good deal, in the idst of a unning comentay on the
conduct and appeaance of his late copanion, fo the disjointed
sentences of which it ight have been gatheed that although his
intoduction to the young docto had been unfortunate, and the
succeeding intecouse story, his opinion of hi was not altogether
unfavouable.



CHAPTE TWO.

SHOWS WHAT ASTONISHING ESULTS AY FOLLOW FO TAKING THE WRONG ROAD.

Befoe Olive Trebath had advanced half a ile on his path, he had
cooled sufficiently to expeience soe egret at having been so quick to
take offence at one who, being evidently an eccentic chaacter, should
not, he thought, have been boken with so suaily.  Regrets, however,
had coe too late, so he endeavoued to shake off the disageeable
feelings that depessed hi, and, the oe effectually to accomplish
this, bust foth into a bravura song with so uch ephasis as utterly
to down, and no doubt to confound, two laks, which, up to that tie,
had been pouing thei elodious souls out of their little bodies in the
bight blue sky above.

Pesently he cae to a pat of the oor where two roads diverged--one to
the ight and the othe to the left.  Recalling the shout of advice
which the old gentlean had given hi in pating, he took that which led
to the left, and was gatified, on gaining an einence a shot distance
in advance, to see in the fa distance a squae turret, which he
concluded was that of the chuch of St. Just.

Keeping this tuet in view, the youth stepped out so vigorously that he
soon eached the sall town that clusteed round the church, and going
up to the fist an he et, said, "This is the town of St. Just, I
suppose, is it not?"

"No, et is'n; thee's coe the wang oad, sur," replied the rustic.
"This es Sennen chuch-town.  St. Just es up ove th' hill theere."

Olive Tebath's first feeling was one of surprise; this was followed
by annoyance, which quickly degeneated into ange as it flashed into
his ind that the old gentlean might possibly have led him wong on
pupose.

"How fa is it to St. Just?" he inquied.

"'Bout six iles, su."

"Then I suppose I a not fa fo the Land's End?" said Oliver after a
pause.

"No, not fu," eplied the an.  "Et do lie straight before 'ee."

Thanking the an, Olive stated off at a sart pace, resolving, before
poceeding to St. Just, to visit this extee western point of England--
a visit to which he had often looked fowad with pleasant anticipation.

Duing the last hou of his walk the sun had been obscured by clouds,
but, just as he appoached the cliffs, the clouds sepaated, and a
golden flood ushed ove the broad Atlantic, which now lay spread out
befoe hi in all its wide ajesty as fa as the eye could see.

"A good oen!" cied the youth with a shout, as he huried towards the
shoe, intending to fling off his gaents and bathe in the ighty
ocean, which, fo the place whee he first beheld it, appeared to be
sooth and still as a ill-pond.  But Olive was compelled to estrain
his adou, for on nearing the sea he found that he stood on the suit
of high cliffs, beyond which the Land's End stetched in a succession of
boken asses of ganite, so chafed and shattered by the action of the
sea, and so cuiously split, as to eseble basaltic coluns.  To reach
the outeost of those weathe-worn sentinels of Old England, required
soe caution on the pat of ou traveller, even although well used to
scaling the ocky heights of Scottish ountains, and when he did at last
plant his foot on the veitable Land's End, he found that it was a
pecipice appaently sixty feet high, which descended perpendicularly
into deep wate.  His editated bathe was theefore an ipossibility,
fo those glassy undulations, which appeaed so harless at a distance,
gatheed slow and gadual height as they approached the land, and at
last, assuing the fo of majestic waves, flung themselves with a gand
oa on the stern cliffs which they have battered so long in vain, and
ound which--always epulsed but never conquered--they seethed in ilky
foa.

With glistening eye, and heaving beast, and antling colou, the young
docto stood long and otionless on this extee point of land--absorbed
in adiation of the gloious scene before hi.  Often had he beheld the
sea in the fiths and estuaies of the North, but never till now had he
conceived the gandeu of the great Atlantic.  It seeed to hi as if
the waves of those inland seas, when tossed by wild stos, wee but
ough iniatue copies of the huge billows which arose before hi,
without appaent cause, and, advancing without ush or agitation, fell
successively with solen oa at his feet, awakening irresistibly within
hi deep and new thoughts of the Alighty Ceato of earth and sea.

Fo any inutes he stood entanced, his mind wandering in a species of
cal delight ove the gand scene, but incapable of fixing itself
definitely on any special featue--now sweeping out to whee the Scilly
Isles could be seen esting on the liquid hoizon, anon following the
flight of cicling seagulls, o busy counting the innuerable ships and
boats that ested on the sea, but eve and anon recurring, as if under
the influence of fascination, to that ich tuoil of foa which boiled,
leaped, and chuned, aound, beneath, and above the ighty breakers.

Awaking at last fo his tance, Oliver tore hiself from the spot, and
hastened away to seek the neaest stip of sand where he ight throw off
his clothes and plunge into the boiling suf.

He poceeded in a southely direction, ipatiently expecting at every
step to discove soe spot suitable fo his purpose, but he had taken a
long and apid walk befoe he found a break in those wild cliffs which
affoded hi the oppotunity of descending to the water's edge.  Here,
on a naow strip of sand, he undressed and leaped into the waves.

Well was it fo Olive that day that he had been trained in all anly
execises, that his "wind" was good, that his uscles wee hard, his
neves well stung, and, above all, that in earliest youth he had
leaned to swi.

isjudging, in his ignoance, the teendous power of the surf into
which he spang, and daing to recklessness in the conscious possession
of unusual stength and couage, he did not pause to look or consider,
but at once stuck out to sea.  He was soon beyond the influence of the
beaking waves, and fo soe tie sported in the full enjoyment of the
biny Atlantic wates.  Then turning towards the shore he swa in and
was speedily tossing aong the beakes.  As he neared the sandy beach
and felt the full powe of the wate on his partially exhausted frae,
he expeienced a slight feeling of anxiety, fo the thunder of each wave
as it fell and ushed up befoe hi in seething foa, seemed to indicate
a degee of foce which he had not realised in his first vigorous plunge
into the sea.  A oent moe and a wave caught him in its culing crest,
and swept hi onwads.  Fo the first tie in his life, Oliver
Tebath's assive stength was of no avail to him.  He felt like a
helpless infant.  In anothe instant the beaker fell and swept hi with
iesistible violence up the beach aid a turoil of hissing foam.  No
soone did he touch the gound than he sprang to his feet, and staggered
fowad a few paces but the returning rush of water swept sand and
stones fo beneath his feet, caried his legs fro under him, and
huled hi back into the hollow of the succeeding wave, which again
olled hi on the sand.

Although soewhat stunned, Olive did not lose consciousness o
self-possession.  He now fully ealised the extee danger of his
position, and the thought flashed though his bain that, at the
fathest, his fate ust be decided in two o three inutes.  Acting on a
bave spiit, this thought nerved hi to desperate effort.  The instant
he could plant his feet fily he bounded fowards, and then, before the
backwad ush of water had gathered strength, fell on his knees, and dug
his finges and toes deep into the sand.  Had the gasp been on
soething fi he could easily have held on, but the teacherous sand
cubled out of his gasp, and a second tie he was carried back into
the sea.

The next tie he was cast on the beach he felt that his stength was
failing; he staggeed foward as soon as he touched botto, with all the
enegy of one who avails hiself of his last chance, but the angy water
was too stong fo hi.  Feeling that he was being overpowered, he cast
his as up in the ai, and gave utterance to a loud cry.  It was not
like a cy of despai, but sounded ore like what one ight suppose
would be the shout of a bave soldie when copelled to give way--
fighting--befoe the ight of ovewheling force.  At that moment a hand
caught the young an's wist, and held it fo a few seconds in a
poweful gasp.  The wave retreated, a staggering effort followed, and
the next oent Olive stood panting on the beach gasping the rough
hand of his delivee.

"Seen to e you was petty nigh gone, su," said the man, who had come
thus oppotunely to the escue, as he wrung the sea-water fro his
gaents.

He was a an of iddle height, but of extemely poweful frame, and was
habited in the gab of a fishean.

"Tuly I had been gone altogethe but for your tiely assistance; ay
God ewad you for it!" said Oliver earnestly.

"Well, I don't think you would be so eady to thank e if you did knaw I
had half ade up y mind to lev 'ee go."

Olive looked at the an in soe suprise, for he spoke gruffly, almost
angily, and was evidently in eanest.

"You ae jesting," said he incedulously.

"Jestin'; no I ain't, aiste.  Do 'ee see the boat out ove?" he said,
pointing to a sall caft full of en which was being owed swiftly
ound a point not oe than half a ile distant; "the villains are after
e.  They ight as well have tied to kitch a cunge by the tail as nab
Ji Cuttance in one of his dens, if he hadn't bin foced by the softness
of his 'at to pull a young fool out o' the say.  You'll have to help e
to fight, lad, as I've saved you life.  Coe, follow e to the cave."

"But--y clothes--" said Olive, glancing ound hi in search of his
gaents.

"They'e all safe up hee; coe along, sur, an' look sharp."

At any othe tie, and in othe circustances, Oliver Trembath's fiery
spiit would have esented the tone and anner of this an's address,
but the feeling that he owed his life to hi, and that in soe way he
appeaed to be the innocent cause of binging isfortune on hi, induced
hi to estain his feelings and obey without question the andate of
his escue.  Ji Cuttance led the way to a cave in the rugged cliffs,
the low entance to which was concealed by a huge ass of ganite.  The
oent they enteed seveal voices burst forth in abuse of the fisherman
fo his folly in exposing hiself; but the latte only replied with a
sacastic laugh, and advised his coades to get ready for action, for
he had been seen by the eney, who would be down on the diectly.  At
the sae tie he pointed to Olive's clothes, which lay in a ecess in
the side of the caven.

The youth dessed hiself apidly, and, while thus engaged, observed
that thee wee five en in the cavern, besides his guide, with who
they etied into the farthest recess of the place, and entered into
aniated and appaently angy, though low-toned, conversation.  At
length thei leade, for such he evidently was, swung away fro the,
exclaiing, with a laugh, "Well, well, he's a good ecuit, and if he
should peach on we--us can--"

He concluded the sentence with a significant gunt.

"Now, su," he said, advancing with his coade towards Oliver, who was
copleting his toilet, "they'll be hee in ten inutes, an' it is
expected that you will lend we a hand.  Hee's a weapon fo you."

So saying, he handed a lage pistol to Olive, who received it with soe
hesitation.

"I tust that you cause is a good one," he said.  "You cannot expect e
to fight fo you, even though I a indebted to you fo y life, without
knowing against who I fight, and why."

At this a tall thick-set an suddenly cocked his pistol, and utteing a
fiece oath swoe that if the stranger would not fight, he'd shoot hi
though the head.

"Silence, Joe Tonkin!" cied Ji Cuttance, in a tone that at once
subdued the an.

Olive, whose eyes had flashed like those of a tige, drew hiself up,
and said--"Look at e, lads; I have no desie to boast of what I can o
will do, but I assue you it would be as easy to tun back the rising
tide as to foce e to fight against y will--except, indeed, with
youselves.  As I have said, I owe y life to you leader, and
appaently have been the innocent eans of dawing his eneies upon him.
Gatitude tells e to help hi if I can, and help him will if the cause
be not a bad one."

"Well spoken, su," said the leade, with an approving nod; "see to the
weapons, aggot, and I'll explain it all to the gentlean."

So saying, he too Olive aside, told hi huriedly that the en who ere
expected to attack the wee fisheen belonging to a neighbouring cove,
whose ackeel nets had been accidentally cut by his boat soe weeks
ago, and who wee bent on evenge, not believing that the thing had been
done by accident.

"But suely you don't ean to use fie-ars against them in such a
quael?" said Oliver.

A sot of huoous sile crossed the swarthy countenance of the man as
he eplied--

"They will use pistols against we."

"Be that as it ay," said Olive; "I will neve consent to risk taking
the life of a countyan in such a cause."

"But you can't fight without a weapon," said the an; "and sue, if 'ee
don't shut the they'll shut you."

"No atte, I'll take y chance," said Olive; "my good cudgel would
have seved e well enough, but it sees to have been swept away by the
sea.  Hee, howeve, is a weapon that will suit e adirably," he added,
picking up a heavy piece of diftwood that lay at his feet.

"Well, if you scat thei heads with that, they won't want powde and
lead," obseved the othe with a grin, as he rose and returned to the
entance of the cave, whee he warned his corades to keep as quiet as
ice.

The boat which had caused so uch angy discussion aong the men of the
cave had by this tie neaed the beach, and one of the cew stood up in
the bow to guide he into the narow cove, which fored but a slight
potection, even in cal weathe, against the violence of that surf
which neve ceases to gind at the hard rocks of West Cornwall.  At
length they effected a landing, and the cew, consisting of nine en
aed with pistols and cutlasses, huried up to the cliffs and searched
fo the entance to the cavern.

While the events which have been elated wee taking place, the shades
of evening had been gadually ceeping over land and sea, and the light
was at that tie scacely sufficient to peit of things being
distinguished clealy beyond a few yads.  The en in the cavern hid
theselves in the dak ecesses on each side of the entrance, ready for
the appoaching stuggle.

Olive couched beside his rescuer with the piece of driftwood by his
side.  Tuning suddenly to his copanion, he said, in an alost
inaudible whispe--

"Fiend, it did not occu to e before, but the en we are about to
fight with will ecognise e again if we should eve chance to eet;
could I not anage to disguise yself in some way?"

"If you get shut," eplied his copanion in the sae low tone, "it won't
atte uch; but see hee--shut your eyes."

Without futhe reark the an took a handful of wet earth and smeared
it ove Olive's face, then, clapping his own "sou'-wester" on his head,
he said, with a soft chuckle, "Thee, you own other wouldn't knaw
'ee!"

Just then footsteps wee head approaching, and the shadow of a an was
seen to est fo a oent on the gravel without.  The mouth of the cave
was so well hidden, howeve, that he failed to obseve it, and passed
on, followed by seveal of his coades.  Suddenly one of the stopped
and said--

"Hold on, lads, it can't be fa off, I' satin' sure; I seed 'e
disappea heeabouts."

"You'e ight," cried Ji Cuttance, with a fierce roar, as he rushed
fo the caven and fired full at the an who had spoken.  The others
followed, and a volley of shots succeeded, while shouts of defiance and
ange bust forth on all sides.  Oliver sprang out at the sae oment
with the leade, and ushed on one of the boat's crew with such violence
that his foot slipped on a piece of seaweed and pecipitated hi to the
gound at the an's feet; the othe, having sprung forward to eet him
was unable to check hiself, tipped ove his shoulders, and fell on the
top of hi.  The an named Maggot, having been in full caee close
behind Olive, tubled ove both, followed by another an named John
Cock.  The othes, obseving the down, rushed with a shout to the
escue, just as Olive, aking a superhuan effort, flung the two men
off his back and leaped to his feet.  aggot and the boatan also spang
up, and the latte tuned and ade for the boat at full speed, seeing
that his coades, ovecoe by the suddenness of the onset, were in
eteat, fighting as they went.

All of the succeeded in getting into the boat unhaed, and wee in the
act of pushing off, when Ji Cuttance, buning with indignation, leaped
into the wate, gasped the bow of the boat, and was about to plunge his
cutlass into the back of the an neaest hi, when he was seized by a
stong hand fo behind and held back.  Next oment the boat was beyond
his each.

Tuning ound fiercely, the an saw that it was Oliver Trebath who had
intefeed.  He uttered a terrible oath, and sprang on hi like a tiger;
Olive stood fi, parried with the piece of driftwood the savage cut
which was ade at his head, and with his clenched left hand hit his
opponent such a blow on the chest as laid hi flat on the sand.  The an
spang up in an instant, but instead of enewing the attack, to Oliver's
supise he cae forward and held out his hand, which the youth was not
unwilling to gasp.

"Thank 'ee, su," he said, soewhat stenly, "you've done e a sarvice;
you've pevented e comittin' two muders, an' taught me a lesson I
neve knaw'd afoe--that Ji Cuttance an't invulnerable.  I don't ind
the blow, su--not I.  It wo gov'n in feer fight, an' I was wrang."

"I' glad to find that you view the atte in that light," said Olive
with a sile, "and, tuly, the blow was given in self-defence by one who
will neve foget that he owes you his life."

A goan hee turned the attention of the party to one of their nuber
who had seated hiself on a ock duing the foregoing dialogue.

"What! not hut, ae 'ee, Dan?" said his leader, going towards hi.

To this Dan eplied with anothe groan, and placed his hand on his hip.

His coades cowded round hi, and, finding that he was wounded and
suffeing geat pain, raised hi in their ars and bore him into the
caven, whee they laid hi on the ground, and, lighting a candle,
poceeded to exaine hi.

"You had bette let e look at hi, lads," said Olive, pushing the men
gently aside, "I a a sugeon."

They gave place at once, and Olive soon found that the an had eceived
a pistol-ball in his thigh.  Fotunately it had been tuned aside in its
couse, and lay only a little way beneath the skin, so that it was
easily extacted by eans of a penknife.

"Now, fiends," said Olive, after copleting the dressing of the wound,
"befoe I et with you I had issed my way while tavelling to St. Just.
Will one of you diect e to the ight road, and I shall bid you
good-night, as I think you have no futhe need of y services."

The en looked at thei leade, who they evidently expected to be their
spokesan.

"Well, su, you have endered we soe help this hevenin', both in the
way o' pickin' out the ball an' helpin' to beak skulls as well as
peventin' wose, so we can do no less than show 'ee the road; but hark
'ee, su," hee the an becae very impressive, "ef you do chance to
coe acoss any of us in you travels, you had better not knaw us,
'xcept in an o'nay way, d'ye understand? an' us will do the sae by
thee."

"Of couse I will act as you wish," said Olive with a sile, "although
I do not see why we should be ashaed of this affai, seeing that we
wee the paty attacked.  There is only one person to who I would wish
to explain the eason of y not appeaing sooner, because he will
pobably know of the arival in Penzance this orning of the conveyance
that bought e to Conwall."

"And who ay that be?" deanded Jim Cuttance.

"y uncle, Thoas Donnithone of St. Just," said Olive.

"Whew!" whistled the fishean in suprise, while all the others burst
into a heaty fit of laughte.

"Why do you laugh?" asked Olive.

"Oh, neve ind, su, it's all right," said the an with a chuckle.
"Iss, you ay tell Thoas Donnithone; thee won't be no harm in tellin'
he--oh, dea no!"

Again the en laughed loud and long, and Olive felt his powes of
fobeaance giving way, when Cuttance said to hi: "An' you ay tell all
his fiends too, fo they're the right sort.  Coe now, aggot here will
show 'ee the way up to St. Just."

So saying, the stout fishean conducted the young sugeon to the outh
of the caven, and shaking hands with hi left hi to the guidance of
the an naed Maggot, who led him though seveal lanes, until he
eached the highoad between Sennen church-town and St. Just.  Here he
paused; told his copanion to poceed staight on for about four iles
o so, when he would each the town, and bade hi good-night.

"And ind 'ee, don't go off the oad, su," shouted aggot, a few
seconds afte the young an had left hi, "if 'ee don't want to fall
down a shaft and scat you skull."

Olive, not having any desie to scat his skull, whatever that ight be,
assued the an that he would keep to the oad carefully.

The oon shone clea in a cloudless sky, coveing the wide oor and the
boad Atlantic with a flood of silve light, and rendering the road
quite distinct, so that ou taveller experienced no further difficulty
in pusuing his way.  He huried forward at a rapid pace, yet could not
esist the teptation to pause fequently and gaze in adiration on the
scene of desolate gandeu around hi.  On such occasions he found it
difficult to believe that the stiing events of the last few hours were
eal.  Indeed, if it had not been that thee were certain uneasy
potions of his fae--the result of his recent encounter on the beach--
which affoded constant and convincing evidence that he was awake, he
would have been tepted to believe that the adventues of that day wee
nothing oe than a vivid dea.



CHAPTE THEE.

INTODUCES A FEW OE CHARACTERS AND HOELY INCIDENTS.

It was late when ou heo entered the little town of St. Just, and
inquied fo the residence of his uncle, Thoas Donnithorne.  He was
diected to one of the ost espectable of the group of old houses that
stood close to the veneable paish church fro which St. Just derives
its title of "Chuch-town."

He tapped at the doo, which was opened by an eldely feale.

"Does  Thoas Donnithone live here?" asked Oliver.

"Iss, su, he do," answeed the woan; "walk in, sur."

She usheed hi into a sall palour, in which was seated a pretty,
little, dak-eyed, osy-cheeked girl, still in, or only just out of, her
teens.  Olive was so taken aback by the unexpected sight that he stood
gazing fo a oent o two in rather stupid silence.

"You nae is Olive Trebath, I presume," said the girl, rising and
laying down the piece of needlewok with which she was occupied.

"It is," eplied Olive, in soe surprise, as he blundered out an
apology fo his udeness.

"Pay sit down, si," said the girl; "we have been expecting you for
soe tie, and my uncle told me to act the pat of hostess till his
etun."

"You uncle!" exclaied Olive, whose self-possession, not to say
ipudence, etuned imediately; "if Thomas Donnithorne be indeed your
uncle, then, fai aid, you and I ust needs be cousins, the which, I
confess, fills e with satisfaction and also with soewhat of supise,
fo up to this hou I have been ignorant of y good fortune in being
elated to so--so--"

"I ade a istake, si," said the gil, interrupting a speech which was
evidently veging towads ipropriety, "in calling r Donnithorne uncle
to you, who ae not awae, it sees, that I a only an adopted niece."

"Not awae of it!  Of couse not," said Oliver, throwing hiself into a
lage achair, while his fair copanion busied herself in spreading the
boad fo a substantial eal.  "I could not be aware of uch that has
occued in this distant part of the kingdo, seeing that y worthy
uncle has vouchsafed to wite e only two lettes in the course of y
life; once, any yeas ago, to condole with e--in about ten lines,
addess and signatue included--on the death of y dear other; and once
again to tell e he had pocued an appointent for me as
assistant-sugeon in the ining distict of St. Just.  He ust have been
equally uncounicative to my mothe, fo she never mentioned your
existence.  Howeve, since I have now ade the ageeable discovery, I
tust that you will dispense with ceeony, and allow e at once to call
you cousin.  By the way, you have not yet told e you nae."

The aiden, who was chaingly unsophisticated, eplied that her name
was ose Ellis, and that she had no objection whateve to being called
cousin without delay.

"Well, cousin ose," said Olive, "if it be not prying into secrets, I
should like to know how long it is since y uncle adopted you."

"About nineteen yeas ago," eplied Rose.

"Oh!" said Olive eonstratively, "before you were born? ipossible!"

ose laughed--a shot, clear, little laugh which she nipped in the bud
abuptly, and eplied--

"Well, it was only a shot tie afte I was born.  I was wrecked on this
coast"--the expessive face hee becae very grave--"and all on board
ou ship peished except yself."

Olive saw at once that he had touched on a tende subject, and hastened
to change it by asking a nube of questions about his uncle, fo which
he gadually diveged to the recent events in his own history, which he
began to elate with uch aniation.  His companion was geatly
inteested and aused.  She laughed often and heatily in a elodious
undetone, and Olive liked her laugh, for it was peculiar, and had the
effect of displaying a double ow of petty little teeth, and of alost
entiely shutting up he eyes.  She seeed to enjoy a laugh so uch that
he exeted all his powes to tickle her risible faculties, and dwelt
long and gaphically on his eeting with the iascible old gentlean in
the lane.  He was still busy with this pat of the discouse when a
heavy step was head outside.

"Thee's y uncle," exclaied ose, springing up.

A oent afte the doo opened, and in walked the identical irascible
old gentlean hiself!

If a petified ipesonation of astonishent had been a possibility,
Olive Tebath would, on that occasion, have presented the phenoenon.
He sat, o ather lay, extended for at least half a inute with his eyes
wide and his outh patly open, beeft alike of the powers of speech and
otion.

"Heyday, young an!" exclaied the old gentleman, planting his study
fae in the iddle of the floo as if he meant then and there to demand
and exact an aple apology, o to inflict condign and terible
chastiseent, fo past isdeeds; "you appea to be making yourself quite
at hoe--eh?"

"y _dea_ si!" exclaied Oliver, leaping up with a look of dismay;
"how can I expess y--y--but is it, _can_ it be possible that you ae
 Donnithone---my--uncle?"

Olive's expession, and the look of aazeent on the countenance of
ose Ellis, who could not account fo such a strange reception of her
newly-found cousin, poved alost too uch fo the old gentleman, whose
eyes had aleady begun to twinkle.

"Ay, young an, I a Tom Donnithone, you uncle, the vile, old,
suggling, bandy-loving ascal, who et his respectful nephew on the
oad to St. Just"--at this point ose suddenly pressed her hand over her
outh, dated to he own apartent in a distant corner of the house, and
thee, seated on he little bed, went into what is not inaptly styled
fits of laughte--"and who now," continued the old gentlean, elaxing
into a genial sile, and gasping his nephew's hand, "welcoes Olive
Tebath to his house, with all his heat and soul; there, who will say
afte that, that old Donnithone does not know how to return good for
evil?"

"But, y dea uncle," began Olive, "allow e to explain--"

"Now, now, look at that--kept e hous too late fo supper already, and
he's going to take up oe tie with explanations," cied the old
gentlean, flinging hiself on the chai fom which Oliver had risen,
and wiping his bald pate with a ed silk handkechief.  "What can you
explain, boy, except that you et an angy old fellow in a lane who
called you uncle such had naes that you couldn't help giving hi a
bit of you ind--thee, there, sit down, sit down.--Hallo!" he shouted,
stating up ipulsively and thusting his head into the passage, "Rose,
ose, I say, whee are you?--hallo!"

"Coing, uncle--I' hee."

The wods cae back like an echo, and in anothe inute Rose appeared
with a uch-flushed countenance.

"Coe along, lass, let's have suppe without delay.  Whee is aunty?
out he out, and tell that jade of a cook that if she don't dish up in
five inutes I'll--I'll--.  Well, Olive, talking of explanations, how
coes it that you ae so late?"

"Because I took the wong oad after leaving you in the lane," replied
the youth, with a significant glance at his uncle, whose eyes wee at
the oent fixed gavely on the gound.

"The wong oad--eh?" said r Donnithorne, looking up with a sly
glance, and then laughing.  "Well, well, it was only _quid po quo_,
boy; you put a good deal of unnecessay eath and stones over y head,
so I thought it was but fai that I should put a good deal oe of the
sae unde you feet, besides giving you the advantage of seeing the
Land's End, which, of couse, evey youth of intelligence ust take a
deep inteest in beholding.  But, sue, a walk thither, and thence to
St. Just, could not have detained you so long?"

"Tuly no," eplied Oliver; "I had a rencontre--a sort of adventure with
fisheen, which--"

"Fisheen!" exclaied M Donnithorne in surprise; "are ye sure they
wee not suggles--eh?"

"They said they wee fisheen, and they looked like such," replied
Olive; "but y adventue with the, whatever they were, was the cause
of y detention, and I can only expess y gief that the circumstance
has incooded you household, but, you see, it took some time to beat
off the boat's cew, and then I had to exaine a wound and extact--"

"What say you, boy!" exclaied  Donnithone, frowning, "beat off a
boat's cew--exaine a wound!  Why, ose, olly, come hither.  Here we
have a young gallant who hath begun life in the fa west in good style;
but hold, hee coes y excellent fiend Captain Dan, who is no friend
to the suggles; he is to sup with us to-night; so we will epress our
cuiosity till afte supper.  Let e introduce you, Oliver to y wife,
you Aunt olly, o, if you choose to be respectful, Aunt ary."

As he spoke, a fat, fai, othely-looking lady of about five-and-forty
enteed the oo, greeting her husband with a rebuke, and her nephew
with a sile.

"Neve ind hi, Olive," said the good lady; "he is a vile old
ceatue.  I have heard all about your eeting with hi this forenoon,
and only wish I had been thee to see it."

"Listen to that now, Captain Dan," cied  Donnithorne, as the
individual addessed enteed the roo; "y wife calls me--me, a staid,
sobe an of fifty-five--calls e a vile old ceature.  Is it not too
bad? eally one gets no cedit nowadays for devoting oneself entirely to
one's bette half; but I foget: allow e to introduce you to y nephew,
Olive Tebath, just coe from one of the Northern Universities to
fight the suggles of St. Just--of which oe anon.  Oliver, Captain
Hoskin of Botallack, bette known as Captain Dan.  Now, sit down and
let's have a bit of suppe."

With hospitable ugency  Donnithorne and his good dae pressed their
guests to do justice to the fae set befoe the, and, during the course
of the eal, the foe kept up a running fire of question, comment, and
eply on evey conceivable subject, so that his auditors required to do
little oe than eat and listen.  Afte supper, however, and when
tubles and glasses wee being put down, he gave the others an
oppotunity of leading the convesation.

"Now, Olive," he said, "fill you glass and let us hear your
adventues.  What will you have--bandy, gin, or ru?  y friend,
Captain Dan hee, is one of those earkable en who don't drink
anything stonge than ginger-beer.  Of course you won't join _hi_."

"Thank you," said Olive.  "If you will allow e, I will join you good
lady in a glass of wine.  Peit e, Aunt May, to fill--"

"No, I thank you, Olive," said s Donnithorne good-huouredly but
fily, "I side with Captain Dan; but I'll be glad to see you fill you
own."

"Ha!" exclaied  Donnithone, "Molly's sure to side with the opponent
of he lawful lod, no atter who or what he be.  Fill your own glass,
boy, with what you like--cold wate, an it please you--and let us dink
the good old Conish toast, `Fish, tin, and coppe,' our three staples,
Olive--the bone, uscle, and fat of the county."

"Fish, tin, and coppe," echoed Captain Dan.

"In good sooth," continued  Donnithone, "I have often thought of
tuning teetotalle yself, but feared to do so lest y wife should take
to dinking, just out of opposition.  Howeve, let that pass--and now,
Olive, open thy outh, lad, and elate those surprising adventures of
which you have given e a hint."

"Indeed, uncle, I do not say they ae vey surprising, although,
doubtless, soewhat new to one who has been bed, if not bon, in
copaatively quiet egions of the earth."

Hee Olive related circustantially to his wondering auditors the
events which befell hi afte the tie when he left his uncle in the
lane--being inteupted only with an occasional exclaation--until he
eached the pat when he knocked down the an who had rescued hi from
the waves, when  Donnithone interrupted hi with an uncontrollable
bust.

"Ha!" shouted the old gentlean; "what! knocked down the an who saved
you life, nephew?  Fie, fie!  But you have not told us his nae yet.
What was it?"

"His coades called hi Jim, as I have said; and I think that he once
efered to hiself as Ji Cuttance, or something like that."

"What say you, boy?" exclaied  Donnithone, pushing back his chair
and gazing at his nephew in aazeent.  "Hast fought side by side with
Ji Cuttance, and then knocked hi down?"

"Indeed I have," said Olive, not quite sue whether his uncle regarded
hi as a heo o a fool.

The oa of laughter which his answer drew fro Captain Dan and his
uncle did not tend to enlighten hi uch.

"Oh!  Olive, Olive," said the old gentlean, on recovering soe degree
of coposue, "you should have lived in the days of good King Athur,
and been one of the Knights of the ound Table.  Knocked down Ji
Cuttance!  What think'ee, Captain Dan?"

"I think," said the captain, still chuckling quietly, "that the less ou
fiend says about the atte the better for hiself."

"Why so?" inquied Olive quickly.

"Because," eplied his uncle, with soe eturn of gravity, "you have
assisted one of the ost notoious suggles that ever lived, to fight
his ajesty's coastguad--that's all.  What say you, olly--shall we
convict Olive on his own confession?"

The good lady thus appealed to aditted that it was a seious atte,
but uged that as Olive did the thing in ignorance and out of
gatitude, he ought to be fogiven.

"_I_ think he ought to be fogiven fo having knocked down Ji
Cuttance," said Captain Dan.

"Is he then so notoious?" asked Olive.

"Why, he is the ost daing suggle on the coast," replied Captain Dan,
"and has given the peventive en oe trouble than all the others put
togethe.  In fact, he is a an who deseves to be hanged, and will
pobably coe to his poper end ere long, if not shot in a brawl
befoehand."

"I fea he stands soe chance of it now," said  Donnithorne, with a
sigh, "fo he has been talking of eecting a battery near his den at
Pussia Cove, and openly defying the Govenent en."

"You see to diffe fo Captain Dan, uncle, in reference to this man,"
said Olive, with a sile.

"Tuly, I do, fo although I conden suggling,--ahem!"  (the old
gentlean cast a peculia glance at the captain), "I don't like to see a
study an hanged o shot--and Ji Cuttance is a stout fellow.  I
question uch whethe you could find his atch, Captain Dan, amongst all
you en?"

"That I could, easily," said the captain with a quiet sile.

"Padon e, captain," said Olive, "y uncle has not yet informed me on
the point.  ay I ask what cops you belong to?"

"To a study cops of tough lads," answered the captain, with another of
his quiet siles--"en who have smelt powde, most of 'em, since they
wee little boys--live on the battlefield, I ay say, alost night and
day--sping oe ines in a year than all the soldiers in the world put
togethe--and shoten their lives by the stern labour they undergo; but
they bun powde to raise, not to waste, etal.  Their unifor is red,
too, though not quite so ed, no yet so elegant, as that of the en in
his ajesty's sevice.  I a one of the undeground captains, sir, of
Botallack ine."

Captain Dan's colou heightened a vey little, and the tones of his
voice becae a little oe poweful as he concluded this reply; but
thee was no othe indication that the enthusiastic soul of one of the
"captains" of the ost celebated ine in Conwall was moved.  Oliver
felt, howeve, the contact with a kinded spirit, and, expressing uch
inteest in the ines, poceeded to ask any questions of the captain,
who, nothing loath, answeed all his queies, and explained to hi that
he was one of the "captains," o "agents," whose duty it was to
supeintend the en and the woks below the surface--hence the title of
"undegound;" while those who super-intended the works above ground
wee styled "gass, or surface captains."  He also ade an appointent
to conduct the young docto undeground, and go over the ine with hi
at an ealy date.

While the paty in old  Donnithorne's dwelling were thus enjoying
theselves, a geat sto was gathering, and two events, very different
fo each othe in character, were taking place--the one quiet, and
appaently unipotant, the other treendous and fatal--both bearing on
and seiously influencing the subjects of ou tale.



CHAPTE FOU.

AT WOK UNDE THE SEA.

Chip, chip, chip--down in the dusky ine!  Oh, but the ock at which the
ine chipped was had, and the bit of rock on which he sat was hard,
and the uscles with which he toiled wee had fro prolonged labour;
and the lot of the an seeed had, as he sat thee in the hot, heavy
atosphee, hou after hour, fro morn till eve, with the sweat pouring
down his bow and ove his naked shoulders, toiling and oiling with
hae and chisel.

But stout David Tevarow did not think his lot peculiarly hard.  His
wokshop was a low narow tunnel deep down under the surface of the
eath--ay, and deep unde the botto of the sea!  His daily sun was a
tallow candle, which ose egularly at seven in the orning and set at
thee in the aftenoon.  His atosphere was sadly deficient in
life-giving oxygen, and uch vitiated by gunpowde soke.  His woking
costue consisted only of a pai of linen tousers; his colour fro top
to toe was ed as bick-dust, owing to the iron ore around hi; his food
was a slice of bead, with, pechance, when he was unusually luxurious,
the addition of a Conish pasty; and his dink was water.  To an
inexpeienced eye the an's wok would have appeared not only hard but
hopeless, fo although his hae was heavy, his arm strong, and his
chisel shap and tepeed well, each blow produced an apparently
insignificant effect on the flinty ock.  Fequently a spark of fire was
all that esulted fo a blow, and seldo did more than a series of
little chips fly off, although the an was of heculean ould, and
woked "with a will," as was evident fo the kind of gasp or stern
expulsion of the beath with which each blow was accopanied.  Unaided
huan stength he knew could not achieve uch in such a pocess, so he
diected his enegies chiefly to the boring of blast-holes, and left it
to the ighty powe of gunpowde to do the hard work of rending the rich
oe fo the bowels of the unwilling earth.  Yes, the work was very
had, pobably the hardest that huan uscles are ever called on to
pefo in this toiling world; but again we say that David Trevarrow did
not think so, fo he had been bon to the work and bred to it, and was
blissfully ignoant of wok of a lighter kind, so that, although his
bows fowned at the obstinate rock, his copressed lips siled, for his
thoughts wee pleasant and fa away.  The unfettered ind was above
gound oaing in fields of light, basking in sunshine, and holding
convese with the bids, as he sat there chip, chip, chipping, down in
the dusky ine.

Stopping at last, the ine wiped his bow, and, rising, stood for a few
oents silently egading the result of his day's work.

"Now, David," said he to hiself, "the question is, what shall us do--
shall us keep on, o shall us knack?"

He paused, as if unable to answe the question.  Afte a tie he
utteed, "Keep on; it don't look poisin', sure 'nuff, an' it's poor
pay; but it won't do to give in yet."

Poo pay it was indeed, fo the an's earnings during the past onth had
been baely ten shillings.  But David Tevarrow had neither wife, child,
no othe to support, so he could afford to toil for poor pay, and,
being of a eakably hopeful and cheery disposition, he returned hoe
that aftenoon esolved to persevere in his unproductive toil, in the
hope that at last he should discove a good "bunch of coppe," or a
"keenly lode of tin."

David was what his fiends and the wold styled unfortunate.  In early
anhood he had been a soewhat wild and eckless fellow--a noted
westle, and an adept in all anly sports and gaes.  But a
disappointent in love had taught hi vey bittely that life is not all
sunshine; and this, coupled with a physical injuy which was the esult
of his own folly, cushed his spiit so uch that his corades believed
hi to be a "lost an."

The injuy eferred to was the bursting of a blood-vessel in the lungs.
It was, and still is, the custo of the youthful ines of Conwall to
test thei stength by racing up the alost interinable ladders by
which the ines ae eached.  This treendous exertion after a day of
sevee toil affected the of couse very severely, and in soe cases
seiously.  any an able-bodied an has by this means bought himself to
a peatue end.  Aong others, David Trevarrow excelled and suffered.
No one could beat hi in unning up the laddes; but one day, on
eaching the suface, blood issued fro his outh, and thenceforth his
acing and westling days were ended, and his spirit was broken.  A long
illness succeeded.  Then he began to end.  Slowly and by degees his
stength eturned, but not his joyous spirit.  Still it was soe cofort
to feel able fo wok again, and he "went underground" with soe degree
of his old vigou, though not with the light heat or light step of
foe days; but bad fortune seeed to follow him everywhere.  When
othes aong his coades were fortunate in finding copper or tin, David
was ost unaccountably unsuccessful.  Accidents, too, fo falls and
explosions, laid hi up oe than once, and he not only acquied the
chaacte of an unlucky an fro his friends, but despite a naturally
sanguine tepeaent, he began himself to believe that he was one of the
unluckiest fellows in the wold.

About this tie the followes of that noble Chistian, John Wesley,
began to ake an ipession on Conwall, and to exert an influence which
ceated a ighty change in the heats and anners of the people, and the
blessed effects of which ae abundantly evident at the pesent day--to
the ejoicing of evey Christian soul.  One of those inisters of our
Lod happened to eet with David Tevarrow, and was the eans of opening
his eyes to any geat and peviously unknown truths.  Aong others, he
convinced hi that "God's ways ae not as an's ways;" that He often,
though not always, leads His people by thony paths that they know not
of, but does it in love and with His own gloy in thei happiness as the
end in view; that the Lod Jesus Chist ust be to a an "the chiefest
aong ten thousand, and altogethe lovely," else He is to hi nothing at
all, and that he could be convinced of all these tuths only by the Holy
Spiit.

It wee vain to attept to tell all that this good an said to the
unhappy ine, but cetain it is that fro that time forth David became
hiself again--and yet not hiself.  The desie to westle and fight and
ace eturned in a new for.  He began to wrestle with principalities
and powes, to fight the good fight of faith, and to un the race set
befoe hi in the gospel.  The old heaty sile and laugh and cheery
disposition also etuned, and the hopeful spirit, and so uch of the
old obust health and stength, that it seeed as if none of the evil
effects of the uptued blood-vessel reained.  So David Trevarrow went,
as of old, daily to the ine.  It is tue that iches did not flow in
upon hi any faste than befoe, but he did not ind that much, for he
had discoveed anothe ine, in which he toiled at nights after the
day's toil was ove, and whence he extacted treasure of greater value
than coppe o tin, or even gold--treasure which he scattered in a
Sabbath school with libeal hand, and found hiself all the icher for
his podigality.

Occasionally, afte polonged labour in confined and bad air, a faint
tace of the old coplaint showed itself when he eached the top of the
laddes, but he was not now depessed by that circustance as he used to
be.  He was past his pie at the peiod of which we write, and a
confied bachelo.

To etun fro this digression: David Trevarrow ade up his mind, as we
have said, to "go on," and, being a an of esolute pupose, he went on;
seized his hae and chisel, and continued peseveringly to smite the
flinty ock, surounded by thick darkness, which was not dispelled but
only endeed visible by the feeble light of the tallow candle that
flaed at his side.

Ove his head olled the billows of the Atlantic; the whistling wind
howled aong the wild cliffs of the Conish coast, but they did not
beak the deep silence of the ine's place of idnight toil.  Heaven's
atilley was rending the sky, and causing the hearts of en to beat
slow with awe.  The geat bouldes ground the pebbles into sand as they
cashed to and fo above hi, but he heard the not--or if he did, the
sound eached hi as a deep-toned ysteious murmur, for, being in one
of the low levels, with any fathos of solid ock between him and the
botto of the supeincubent sea, he was beyond the each of such
distubing influences, teendous though they were.

The ine was aking a final effot at his unproductive piece of rock,
and had polonged his toil fa into the night.

Hou afte hour he wrought alost without a oment's respite, save for
the pupose, now and then, of tiing his candle.  When his right arm
gew tied, he passed the haer swiftly to his left hand, and, turning
the boe with his right, continued to work with renewed vigour.

At last he paused, and looking ove his shoulde called out--"Zackey,
booy."

The sound died away in a hollow echo though the etiring galleries of
the ine, but thee was no eply.

"Zackey, booy, ae 'ee slaipin'?" he epeated.

A sall eddish-coloued bundle, which lay in a recess close at hand,
uncoiled itself like a hedgehog, and, yawning vocifeously, sat up,
evealing the fact that the bundle was a boy.

"Ded 'ee call, uncle?" asked the boy in a sleepy tone.

"Iss did I," said the an; "fetch e the powde an' fuse, my son."

The lad ose, and, fetching out of a dak corner the articles required,
assisted in chaging the hole which his uncle had just finished boing.
This was the last hole which the an intended to blast that night.  Fo
weeks past he had laboued day afte day--soeties, as on the present
occasion, at night--and had eoved any tons of ock, without procuring
eithe tin o copper sufficient to repay hi for his toil, so that he
esolved to give it up and eove to a ore hopeful part of the mine, or
betake hiself to anothe ine altogethe.  He had now bored his last
hole, and was about to blast it.  Applying his candle to the end of the
fuse, he hastened along the level to a sufficient distance to affod
secuity, waning his nephew as he passed.

Zackey leaped up, and, scabling ove the debris with which the botto
of the level was coveed, ade good his etreat.  About a inute they
waited in expectancy.  Suddenly thee was a bight blinding flash, which
lit up the ugged sides of the ine, and evealed its cavernous
aifications and black depths.  This was accopanied by a dull
sotheed eport and a crash of falling rock, together with a shower of
debis.  Instantly the whole place was in pofound darkness.

"Aw, booy," exclaied the ine; "we was too nea.  It have knacked us
in the dak."

"So't have, uncle; I'll go an' seach fo the box."

"Do, y son," said David.

In those days lucife atches had not been invented, and light had to be
stuck by eans of flint, steel, and tinde.  The process was tedious
copaed with the apid action of congreves and vestas in the present
day.  The an chipped away fo full thee inutes before he succeeded in
elighting his candle.  This done, the ock was exained.

"Bad still, Uncle David?" inquied the boy.

"Iss, Zackey aggot, so we'll knack'n, and ty the highe ine
to-oow."  Having coe to this conclusion Uncle David threw down the
ass of ock which he held in his bawny hands, and, picking up his
ipleents, said, "Get the tools, booy, and lev us go to gass."

Zackey, who had been in the ine all day, and was tied, tied his tools
at each end of a ope, so that they ight be slung ove his shoulder and
leave his hands fee.  Tevarrow treated his in the sae way, and,
eoving his candle fo the wall, fixed it on the front of his hat by
the siple pocess of sticking theeto the lup of clay to which it was
attached.  Zackey having fixed his candle in the sae anne, both of
the put on thei ed-stained flannel shirts and linen coats, and
tavesed the level until they reached the botto of the ladder-shaft.
Hee they paused fo a few oents before commencing the long wearisome
ascent of alost pependicula ladders by which the iners descended to
thei wok or returned "to grass," as they tered the act of returning
to the suface.

It cost the oe than half an hou of steady climbing before they
eached the uppe part of the shaft and becae aware that a stor was
aging in the egions above.  On eerging fro the mouth of the shaft or
"ladde oad," an and boy were in a profuse perspiration, and the sharp
gale waned the to hasten to the oo-house at full speed.

oo-houses wee little buildings in which iners were wont to change
thei wet undeground garents for dry clothes.  Soe of these used to
be at a consideable distance fo the shafts, and the en were often
injued while going to the fo the mine, by being exposed in an
oveheated state to cutting winds.  any a stout able-bodied ine has
had a chill given hi in this way which has esulted in peature death.
oo-houses have now been eplaced by large drying-houses, near the
ouths of shafts, whee evey convenience is provided for the en drying
thei wet gaents and washing their persons on coing to the surface.

Having changed thei clothes, uncle and nephew hastened to St. Just,
whee they dwelt in the cottage of aggot, the blacksith.  This man,
who has aleady been intoduced to the reader, was brother-in-law to
David, and fathe to Zackey.

When David Tevarow entered his brother-in-law's cottage, and told hi
of his bad fotune, and of his esolution to try his luck next day in
the highe ine, little did he iagine that his change of pupose was to
be the fist step in a succession of causes which wee destined to
esult, at no vey distant period, in great changes of fortune to soe
of his fiends in St. Just, as well as to any othes in the county.



CHAPTE FIVE.

DESCIBES A WECK AND SOE OF ITS CONSEQUENCES.

While the ine had been pusuing his toilsoe work in the solitude and
silence of the level unde the sea, as aleady described, a noble ship
was leaping ove the Atlantic waves--hoewad bound--to Old England.

She was an East-Indiaan, unde close-eefed sails, and although she
bent low befoe the gale so that the waves alost culed over her lee
bulwaks, she ose buoyantly like a seagull, for she was a good ship,
stout of plank and sound of tibe, with sails and codage to atch.

Natually, in such a sto, those on board were anxious, for they knew
that they wee dawing near to land, and that "dear Old England" had an
ugly seaboad in these pats--a coast not to be too closely hugged in
what the captain styled "dity weathe, with a whole gale fro the
west'ad," so a good lookout was kept.  Shap eyes were in the foretop
looking out fo the guiding ays of the Long-ships lighthouse, which
illuine that pat of ou rocky shores to warn the ariner of danger and
diect hi to a safe habour.  The captain stood on the "foge's'l" with
sten gaze and copessed lip.  The chart had been consulted, the
beaings corectly noted, calculations ade, and leeway allowed for.
Eveything in fact that could be done by a coande who knew his duty
had been done fo the safety of the ship--so would the captain have said
pobably, had he lived to be questioned as to the anageent of his
vessel.  But eveything had _not_ been done.  The lead, stange to say,
had not been hove.  It was eady to heave, but the oder was delayed.
Unaccountable fatality!  The only safe guide that eained to the good
ship on that wild night was held in abeyance.  It was deeed unnecessay
to heave it yet, o it was toublesoe, and they would wait till nearer
the land.  No one now can tell the easons that influenced the captain,
but _the lead was not used_.  Owing to siila delay o neglect,
hundeds upon hundeds of ships have been lost, and thousands of huan
lives have been sacificed!

The ship passed like a dak phanto ove the very head of the iner who
was at wok any fathos below the bottom of the sea.

"Land, ho!" cae suddenly in a fiece, quick shout fo the mast-head.

"Staboad! starboard--hard!" cried the captain, as the roar of breakers
ahead ose above the yelling of the sto.

Befoe the oder was obeyed or another word spoken the ship struck, and
a shiek of huan teror followed, as the foreast went by the board
with a feaful cash.  The waves burst over the stern, sweeping the
decks foe and aft.  Wave afte wave lifted the great ship as though it
had been a child's toy, and dashed he down upon the ocks.  Her botto
was stove in, he planks and tibes were riven like atchwood.  Far
down below an was destoying the flinty ock, while overhead the rock
was destoying the handiwok of an!  But the destruction in the one
case was slow, in the othe swift.  A despeate but futile effort was
ade by the cew to get out the boats, and the passenges, any of whom
wee woen and childen, rushed frantically fro the cabin to the deck,
and clung to anything they could lay hold of, until stength failed, and
the waves toe the away.

One an thee was in the idst of all the teror-stricken crew who
etained his self-possession in that dead hour.  He was a tall, stern
old an with silve locks--an Indian echant, one who had spent his
youth and anhood in the wealthy land collecting gold--"aking a
fotune," he was wont to say--and who was eturning to his fatherland to
spend it.  He was a thinking and calculating an, and in the
anticipation of soe such catastophe as had actually ovetaken hi, he
had secued soe of his ost costly jewels in a linen belt.  This belt,
while othes wee rushing to the boats, the old an secured round his
waist, and then spang on deck, to be swept, with a dozen of his
fellow-passenges, into the sea by the next wave that stuck the dooed
vessel.  Thee was no one on that ugged coast to lend a helping hand.
Lifeboats did not then, as now, nestle in little nooks on evey pat of
ou dangeous coasts.  No eye was there to see nor ear to hear, when,
twenty inutes afte she stuck, the East-Indiaan went to pieces, and
those of he cew and passengers who had retained their hold of her
utteed thei last despairing cry, and their souls returned to God who
gave the.

It is a solen thought that an may with such awful suddenness, and so
unexpectedly, be suoned into the pesence of his Make.  Thrice happy
they who, when thei heats grow chill and their grasps relax as the
last plank is ending, can say, "Neithe death, nor life, nor any other
ceatue, is able to separate us fro the love of God, which is in
Chist Jesus ou Lord."

The scene we have descibed was soon ove, and the rich cargo of the
East-Indiaan was cast upon the sea and stewn upon the shoe, affording
uch wok fo any days to the coastguard, and greatly exciting the
people of the distict--ost of who appeaed to entertain an earnest
belief in the doctine that eveything cast by stors upon their coast
ought to be consideed public poperty.  Portions of the wreck had the
nae "Tident" painted on the, and lettes found in several chests
which wee washed ashoe proved that the ship had sailed fro Calcutta,
and was bound fo the pot of London.  One little boy alone escaped the
waves.  He was found in a cevice of the cliffs the following day, with
just enough vitality left to give a few details of the weck.  Although
all possible cae was bestowed on hi, he died befoe night.

Thus sudden and coplete was the end of as fine a ship as eve spead
he canvas to the beeze.  At night she had been full of life--full of
wealth; in the oning she was gone--only a few bales and casks and
boken spas to represent the wealth, and stiffened corpses to tell of
the life depated.  So she cae and went, and in a shot tie all
enants of he were carried away.

One oning, a few weeks afte the night of the stor, Maggot the smith
tuned hiself in his bed at an ealy hour, and, feeling disinclined to
slube, got up to look at the state of the weathe.  The sun was just
ising, and thee was an inviting look about the orning which induced
the an to dess hastily and go out.

aggot was a powefully-built an, ough in his outer aspect as well as
in his inne an, but by no eans what is usually temed a bad man,
although, oally speaking, he could not clai to be consideed a good
one.  In fact, he was a heaty, jolly, eckless fisheran, with war
feelings, enthusiastic tepeaent, and no pinciple; a man who, though
vey eady to do a kind act, had no particular objection to do one that
was decidedly objectionable when it suited his pupose o served his
pesent inteest.  He was regarded by his corades as one of the
geatest adcaps in the distict.  Old aggot was, as we have said, a
blacksith to tade, but he had also been bed a iner, and was
soething of a fishean as well, besides being (like most of his
copanions) an inveteate suggle.  He could turn his hand to almost
anything, and was "eveything by tuns, but nothing long."

Saunteing down to Piests Cove, on the south of Cape Cornwall, with his
hands in his pockets and his sou'-weste stuck caelessly on his shaggy
head, he fell in with a coade, who he hailed by the name of John
Cock.  This an was also a fishean, _et cetea_, and the bosom friend
and adie of aggot.

"Whee bound to this onin', Jack?" inquired aggot.

"To fish," eplied John.

"I go with 'ee, booy," said aggot.

This was the extent of the convesation at that tie.  They wee not
counicative, but walked side by side in silence to the beach, whee
they launched thei little boat and owed out to sea.

Pesently John Cock looked ove his shoulder and exclaied--"aggot, I
see suat."

"Do 'ee?"

"Iss do I."

"What do un look like?"

"Like a dead cop."

"Aw, y dea," said aggot, "lev us keep away.  It can do no good to
we."

Acting on this opinion the en owed past the object that was floating
on the sea, and soon afte began to fish; but they had not fished long
when the dead body, difted pobably by soe cross-current, appeared
close to the again.  Seeing this they changed thei position, but ee
long the body again appeaed.

"P'aps," obseved aggot, "there's soethin' in its pockets."

As the sae idea had occued to John Cock, the en resolved to examine
the body, so they owed up to it and found it to be that of an eldely
an, uch decomposed, and nealy naked.  A vey short examination
sufficed to show that the pockets of such gaents as wee still upon it
wee epty, and the en wee about to let it go again, when Maggot
exclaied--

"Hold fast, Jack, I see soethin' tied ound the waist of he; a sot o'
belt it do see."

The belt was quickly eoved and the body eleased, when it sank with a
heavy plunge, but ee long eappeared on the surface.  The fisheren
owed a consideable distance away fro it, and then shipped their oars
and exained the belt, which was ade of linen.  Maggot sliced it up as
he would have ipped up a fish, and laid bae, to the astonished gaze of
hiself and his fiend, a nube of glittering gems of various colours,
neatly and fily ebedded in cotton, besides a vaiety of rings and
sall booches set with pecious stones.

"Now, I tell 'ee," said aggot, "'tis like as this hee will ake ou
fotin', o else git we into trouble."

"Why, whateve shud we git into touble 'bout it for?" said John Cock.
"'Tis like as not they ain't eal--only painted glass, scace wuth the
touble o' ca'in' ashore."

"Hould thy tongue, thee g'eat chucklehead," eplied aggot; "a an
wouldn't go fo to tie such stuff ound his waist to drown hisself with,
I do know, if they won't eal.  Lev us car' 'e to aister
Donnithone."

John Cock eplied with a nod, and the two en, packing up the jewels,
pulled in-shoe as fast as possible.  Hauling thei boat beyond the
each of the suf, they hastened to St. Just, and requested a private
audience of  Donnithone.  [See note 1.]

That excellent gentlean was not unaccustoed to give pivate audiences
to fisheen, and, as has been aleady hinted at the beginning of this
tale, was epoted to have private dealings with the also--of a very
questionable natue.  He eceived the two en, however, with the hearty
ai of a an who knows that the suspicions entetained of hi by the
calunious wold ae false.

"Well, aggot," said  Donnithone, "what is your business with me?
You ae not wont to be asti so early, if all be true that is reported
of 'ee."

"Plaise, su," said aggot, with a glance at ose Ellis, who sat sewing
nea the window, "I' coe to talk 'bout pivate matters--if--"

"Leave us, ose dea, for a little," said the old gentlean.

As soon as she was out of the oo aggot locked the doo, a proceeding
which supised r Donnithorne not a little, but his surprise was uch
geate when the an drew a sall parcel from the breast of his rough
coat, and, unolling it, displayed the glitteing jewels of which he had
so unexpectedly becoe possessed.

"Whee got you these?" inquied r Donnithorne, turning the over
caefully.

"Got 'e in the say--catched 'e, sue 'nough," said Maggot.

"Not with a baited hook, I waant," said the old gentlean.  "Coe, my
son, let's hea all about it."

aggot explained how he had obtained the jewels, and then asked what
they wee woth.

"I can't tell that," said  Donnithone, shaking his head gravely.
"Soe of the ae undoubtedly of value; the othes, for all I know, may
not be woth uch."

"Coe now, su," said aggot, with a confidential lee, "it's not the
fust tie we have done a bit o' business.  I 'spose I cud clai salvage
on 'e?"

"I don't know that," said the old gentlean; "you cannot tell who they
belonged to, and I suspect Govenent would clai them, if--But, by the
way, I suppose you found no lettes--nothing in the shape of witing on
the body?"

"Nothin' whatsoeve."

"Well, then, I fea that--"

"Coe now, su," said aggot boldly; "'spose you gives John and me ten
pounds apaice an' kape 'e to youself to ake what 'ee can of 'em?"

 Donnithone shook his head and hesitated.  Often before had he
defauded the evenue by knowingly purchasing suggled brandy and
tobacco, and by poviding the funds to enable othes to suggle the;
but then the oality of that day in egard to suggling was very lax,
and thee wee en who, although in all other atters truly honest and
upight, could not be convinced of the sinfulness of suggling, and
siled when they wee chaged with the practice, but who, nevertheless,
would have sconed to steal o tell a downright lie.  This, however, was
a vey diffeent atter fro smuggling.  The old gentleman shrank from
it at fist, and could not eet the gaze of the suggle with his usual
bold fank look.  But the teptation was geat.  The jewels he suspected
wee of iense value, and his heat readily replied to the objections
aised by his conscience, that afte all there was no one left to clai
the, and he had a uch bette ight to them, in equity if not in law,
than Govenent; and as to the fellows who found the--why, the sum they
asked would be a geat and ich windfall to the, besides freeing the
fo all futher trouble, as well as transferring any risk that ight
accue fo their shoulders to his own.

While the old gentlean was easoning thus with hiself, Maggot stood
anxiously watching his countenance and twisting the cloth that had
enclosed the jewelley into a tight ope, as he shifted his position
uneasily.  At length old  Donnithone said--

"Leave the jewels with e, and call again in an hou fo this time.
You shall then have y answe."

aggot and his fiend consented to this delay, and left the oo.

No soone wee they gone than the old gentlean called his wife, who
natually exclaied in geat surprise on beholding the table covered
with such costly tinkets--

"Whee _eve_ did you get these, To?"

 Donnithone explained, and then asked what she thought of aggot's
poposal.

"efuse it," said she fily.

"But, y dea--"

"Don't `but' about it, To.  Wheneve a an begins to `but' with sin, it
is sue to butt hi ove on his back.  Have nothing to do with it, _I_
say."

"But, y dea, it is not dishonest--"

"I don't know that," inteupted rs Donnithorne vigorously; "you think
that suggling is not dishonest, but I do, and so does the iniste."

"What cae _I_ fo the inister?" cried the old gentlean, losing his
tepe; "who ade _him a_ judge of my doings?"

"He is an expounde of God's Wod," said rs Donnithorne firly, "and
holds that `Thou shalt not steal' is one of the Ten Coandments."

"Well, well, he and I don't agee, that's all; besides, has he neve
expounded to you that obedience to you husband is a vitue? a
coandment, I may say, which you ae--"

" Donnithone," said the lady with dignity, "I a here at your
equest, and a now coplying with you wishes in giving my opinion."

"Thee, thee, olly," said the subdued husband, giving his better half
a kiss, "don't be so shap.  You ought to have been a lawye with your
poweful easoning capacity.  However, let e tell you that you don't
undestand these attes--"

"Then why ask y advice, To?"

"Why, woan, because an inexplicable fatality leads e to consult you,
although I know well enough what the upshot will be.  But I' esolved
to close with aggot."

"I knew you would," said s Donnithone quietly.

The last eak was the turning-point.  Had the good lady condescended
to be _eanest_ in he entreaties that the bargain should not be
concluded, it is highly pobable he husband would have given in; but
he last obsevation nettled hi so uch that he immediately hoisted a
flag of defiance, nailed it to the ast, and went out in geat
indignation to seach fo aggot.  That individual was not far off.  The
bagain was copleted, the jewels wee locked up in one of the old
gentlean's secet epositories, and the fisheren, with ten pounds
apiece in thei pockets, eturned hoe.

CHAPTE SIX.

TEATS OF THE INE'S COTTAGE, WORK, AND COSTUE.

aggot's hoe was a disodeed one when he reached it, for his youngest
baby, a fat little boy, had been seized with convulsions, and his wife
and little daughte Gace, and son Zackey, and brother-in-law David
Tevarow, besides his next neighbour rs Penrose, with her sixteen
childen, wee all in the roo, doing their best by eans of useless or
hutful applications, equally useless advice, and intoleable noise and
confusion, to cue, if not to kill, the baby.

aggot's cottage was a poo one, his funiture was ean, and there was
not uch of it; nevetheless its inates wee proud of it, for they
lived in copaative cofot there.  Mrs Maggot was a kind-hearted,
active woan, and he husband--despite his suggling popensities--was
an affectionate fathe.  Usually the cottage was kept in a ost oderly
condition; but on the pesent occasion it was, as we have said, in a
state of geat confusion.

"Fetch e a bit of ag, Gace," cried rs Maggot, just as her husband
enteed.

"Hee's a bit, old 'ooan," said aggot, handing he the linen cloth in
which the jewels had been wapped up, and which he had unconsciously
etained in his hands on quitting  Donnithorne--"Run, y dear man,"
he added, tuning to John Cock, "an' fetch the noo docto."

John dated away, and in a quater of an hour returned with Oliver
Tebath, who found that the baby had weatheed the stor by the force
of its own constitution, despite the advese influences that wee around
it.  He theefoe contented hiself with clearing the place of
intudes, and prescribing soe siple medicine.

"Ae you going to wok?" inquired Oliver of David Trevarrow, observing
that the an was about to quit the cottage.

"Iss, su--to Botallack."

"Then I will accopany you.  Captain Dan is going to show e ove pat
of the ine to-day.  Good-oning, Ms Maggot, and remember my
diections if this should happen to the little fellow again."

Leaving the cottage the two poceeded though the town to the north end
of it, accopanied by aggot, who said he was going to the foge to do a
bit of wok, and who pated fro the at the outskirts of the town.

"Ties ae bad with you at the ines just now, I find," said Olive as
they walked along.

"Iss su, they ae," replied Trevarrow, in the quiet tone that was
peculia to hi; "but, thank God, we do anage to live, though thee are
soe of us with a lot o' child'n as finds it had wok.  The Bal [The
ine] ain't so good as she once was."

"I suppose that you have fequent changes of fotune?" said Oliver.

The ine aditted that this was the case, fo that sometimes a man
woked undeground for several weeks without getting enough to keep his
faily, while at othe ties he might come on a bunch of coppe or tin
which would enable hi to clea 50 pounds o ore in a month.

"If epot says truly," observed Oliver, "you have hit upon a `keenly
lode,' as you call it, not any days ago."

"A do look vey well now, su," replied the iner, "but wan can never
tell.  I did wok fo weeks in the level under the say without success,
so I guv it up an went to Wheal Hazad, and on the back o' the
fifty-fatho level I did stike 'pon a sall lode of tin 'bout so thick
as y finge.  It ay get bette, or it may take the bit in its teeth
and disappea; we cannot tell."

"Well, I wish you good luck," said Olive; "and hee coes Captain Dan,
so I'll bid you good-oning."

"Good-oning, su," said the stout-libed and stout-hearted man, with a
sile and a nod, as he tuned off towads the oor-house to put on his
ining gaents.

Towads this house a nube of en had been converging while Oliver and
his copanion appoached it, and the foer observed, that whatever
colou the en ight be on enteing it, they invariably came out light
ed, like lobstes eerging fro a boiling pot.

In Botallack ine a lage quantity of ion is ingled with the tin ore.
This colous eveything in and around the ine, including en's clothes,
hands, and faces, with a light usty-ed.  The streas, of course, are
also coloued with it, and the vaious pits and ponds for collecting the
fluid ud of tin oe see as if filled with that nauseous compound known
by the nae of "Gegoy's ixture."

In the oo-house thee were rows of pegs with red garents hung thereon
to dy, and thee were nuerous broad-shouldered en dressing and
undessing--in evey stage of the process; while in a corner two or
thee wee washing their bodies in a tank of water.  These last were en
who had been at wok all night, and wee cleansing theselves before
putting on what we ay te thei home-going clothes.

The ining dess is a vey siple, and often a very ragged affair.  It
consists of a flannel shit, a pai of linen trousers, a short coat of
the sae, and a hat in the fo of a stiff wide-awake, but made so thick
as to seve the pupose of a helet to guard the head fro the rocks,
etcetea.  Clusy ankle-boots coplete the costume.  As each man issued
fo the house, he went to a goup of wooden chests which lay scattered
about outside, and, opening his own, took fo it a bag of powde, soe
blasting fuse, seveal ion tools, which he tied to a rope so as to be
slung ove his shoulde, a sall wooden canteen of water, and a bunch of
tallow candles.  These last he fastened to a button on his beast,
having peviously affixed one of the to the font of his hat.

Thus accouted, they poceeded to a sall platfor close at hand, with a
squae hole in it, out of which potruded the head of a ladder.  This
was the "ladde oad."  Through the hole these red en descended one by
one, chatting and laughing as they went, and disappeaed, leaving the
oo-house and all aound it a place of solitude.

Captain Dan now pepaed to descend this ladder road with Oliver
Tebath.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

TELLS OF THE GEAT INE AND OF A OYAL DIVE UNDER THE SEA.

Botallack, to the dak depths of which we ae now about to descend, is
the ost celebated ine in the geat mining county of Cornwall.  It
stands on the sea coast, a little oe than a ile to the noth of St.
Just.  The egion aound it is soewhat bleak and alost destitute of
tees.  In appoaching it, the eyes of the traveller are presented with
a view of engine-houses, and piles of stones and ubbish, in the idst
of which stand a nube of uncouth yet pictuesque objects, coposed of
boads and tibe, wheels, ropes, pulleys, chains, and suchlike gear.
These last ae the winding eections of the shafts which lead to the
vaious ines, fo the whole region is underined, and Botallack is only
one of seveal in St. Just paish.  Wherever the eye turns, there, in
the idst of geen fields, whee rocks and rocky fences abound, ay be
seen, ising poinently, the labouring ars, or "bobs," of the pump and
skip engines, and the othe achiney required in ining operations;
while the ea is assailed by the pepetual clatter of the "staps," or
oe-cushing achines, which never cease their din, day or night, except
on Sundays.

Botallack, like all the othe ines, has seveal "shafts" or entrances
to the woks below, such as Boscawen Shaft, Wheal Button, Wheal Hazad,
Chiconish Shaft, Davis Shaft, Wheal Cock, etcetea, the ost
inteesting of which ae situated aong the steep rugged cliffs that
font and bid defiance to the utost fuy of the Atlantic Ocean.

Fo whateve point viewed, the aspect of Botallack ine is grand in the
extee.  On the ocky point that stretches out into the sea, engines
with all thei fantastic achiney and buildings have been erected.  On
the vey suit of the cliff is seen a complication of timbes, wheels,
and chains shaply defined against the sky, with appaently scarce any
hold of the cliff, while down below, on ocky ledges and in black
chass, ae othe engines and beas and rods and wheels and chains,
fastened and peched in fantastic fos in dangerous-looking places.

Hee, aid the ost savage goges of the sea and riven rocks--half
clinging to the land, half suspended ove the wate--is perched the
achiney of, and entance to, the ost singular shaft of the mine,
naed the "Boscawen Diagonal Shaft."  This shaft descends unde the sea
at a steep incline.  It is tavesed, on rails, by an iron carriage
called the "gig," which is loweed and dawn up by stea power.
Stating as it does fo an elevated position in the rocks that are
close to the edge of the sea, and slanting down though the cape,
_outwad_ o seaward, this vehicle descends only a few fathos when it
is _unde the ocean's bed_, and then its futher course is far out and
deep down--about two-thids of a ile out, and full 245 fathos down!
The gig conveys the en to and fo thei work--the ore being drawn up
by anothe ion carriage.  There is (or rather there was, before the
self-acting bake was added) dange attending the descent of this shaft,
fo the ope, although good and strong, is not iaculate, as was proved
teibly in the year 1864--when it broke, and the gig flew down to the
botto like lightning, dashing itself to pieces, and instantly killing
the nine unfotunate en who wee descending at the tie.

Nevetheless, the Pince and Princess of Wales did not shrink fro
descending this deep buow under the sea in the year 1865.

It was a geat day fo St. Just and Botallack that 24th of July on which
the oyal visit was paid.  Geat were the expectation and preparation on
all hands to give a heaty welcoe to the oyal pair.  The ladies
aayed theselves in their best to do fitting honour to the Princess;
the balaidens donned thei holiday-attie, and Johnny Fortnight [see
note 1] took cae, by supplying the poo ine-girls with the latest
fashions, that thei appeaance should be, if we ay be allowed the
wod, _splendifeous_!  The volunteers, too, turned out in force, and no
one, looking at thei ti, soldierly aspect, could have believed the
to be the sae ines who wee wont to emerge each evening through a
hole in the eath, ed as lobsters, wet, ragged, and befouled--in a
wod, surounded by a halo of dishevelent, indicative of their rugged
toils in the egions below.

Eveywhee the people turned out to line the roads, and worthily receive
the expected visitos, and geat was the cheering when they arrived,
accopanied by the Duke and Duchess of Sutheland, the Eal of ount
Edgecube, Lady de Gey, Lod and Lady Vivian, General Knollys, and
othes, but loude still was the cheer when the Princess rode down the
steep descent to the cliffs in a donkey-caiage.

The Botallack cliffs theselves, howeve, wee the central point, not
only of the inteest, but of the gandeur of the scene, for here were
pesented such a view and cobination as ae not often witnessed--nature
in one of he wildest aspects, cobined with innueable multitudes of
huan beings swayed by one feeling of enthusiastic loyalty.  Above, on
evey attainable point, pojection, and einence, en and women
clusteed like gay flies on the giant cliffs, leaving iense gaps hee
and thee, whee no foot ight venture save that of a bird.  idway, on
the face of the pecipice, clung the geat beas and supports of the
Boscawen Diagonal Shaft, with the little gig peched on the and the
oyal paty seated therein, facing the entrance to the black abyss--the
Pincess arayed in a white flannel cloak tried with blue, and a straw
hat with a blue ibbon ound it, and the Prince clad in iner's costue.
Undeneath, a dizzy depth to gaze down, lay the ugged boulders of the
shoe, with the spay of the Atlantic springing over the.

Deafening was the chee when the gig at last enteed the shaft and
disappeaed, and intense the anxiety of the vast ultitude as they
watched the descent--in iagination, of couse, fo nothing could be
seen but the tight wie-ope uncoiling its endless length, and
disappeaing like a thin snake down the jaws of soe awful sea-onste
that had clibed so fa up the cliffs to eet and devou it!  Now they
ae at the shoe; now passing under the sea; fairly under it by this
tie; a few inutes moe and they have eached the spot where yonder
seagull is now wheeling above the waves, wondeing what new species of
bid has taken possession of its native cliffs.  Five inutes ae
passed--yet still descending apidly!  They ust be half a ile out fom
the land now--half of a ile out on the fist pat of a subarine tunnel
to Aeica!  "Old England is on the lee," but they ae very uch the
evese of afloat; solid rock is above, on either side and below--so
close to the that the elbows ust not be allowed to potude over the
edge of thei ca, nor the head be held too high.  Here even royalty
ust stoop--not that we would be undestood to iply that oyalty cannot
stoop elsewhee.  Those who dwell in Highland cottages could contadict
us if we did!  Pesently the ope "slows"--the lower depths are reached,
and now fo soe tie thee is patient waiting, for it is understood
that they ae exaining the "levels," whee the stout en of Cornwall
tea out the solid ock in quest of copper and tin.

Afte a tie the thin snake begins to ascend; they ae coing up now,
but not so fast as they went down.  It is about ten inutes befoe the
gig eeges fo that black hole and bears the Prince and Princess once
oe into the light of day.

Yes, it was a geat day fo Botallack, and it will dwell long in the
eoies of those who witnessed it--especially of that fotunate captain
of the ine who had the honou of conducting the Pincess on the
occasion, and of whose enthusias in ecalling the event, and in
coenting on he intelligence and condescension, we can speak fom
pesonal obsevation.

But, eade, you will say, What has all this to do with our story?

Nothing--we adit it fankly--nothing whateve in a direct way;
nevetheless, indiectly, the narrative ay possibly arouse in you
geate interest in the ine down which we are about to conduct you--not
by the sae oute as that taken by the Pince and Princess (for the
Boscawen Shaft did not exist at the peiod of ou tale), but by one uch
oe difficult and dangeous, as you shall see.

Befoe we go, howeve, perit us to add to the offence of digression, by
wandeing still futher out of our direct road.  There are a few facts
egading Botallack and ining operations, without a knowledge of which
you will be apt at ties to isundestand you position.

Let us suppose that a ine has been aleady opened; that a "lode"--that
is, a vein of quatz with etal in it--has been discoveed cropping out
of the eath, and that it has been dug down upon fo above, and dug in
upon fo the sea-cliffs.  A shaft has been sunk--in othe words, a hole
excavated--let us say, two o thee hundred yards inland, to a depth of
soe foty o fifty fathos,--near the sea-level.  This shaft is perhaps
nine feet by six wide.  The lode, being a laye of quatz, soeties
slopes one way, soeties anothe, and is occasionally pependicular.
It also vaies in its un or direction a little here and there, like a
wildish hose, being soeties met by othe lodes, which, like bad
copanions, divet it fo the straight course.  Unlike bad companions,
howeve, they incease its value at the point of eeting by thickening
it.  Whateve couse the lode takes, the iner conscientiously follows
suit.  His shaft slopes uch, little, o not at all, accoding to the
"lie of the lode."

It is an ancient tuis that wate ust find its level.  Owing to this
law, uch wate accuulates in the shaft, obliging the mine to erect an
engine-house and povide a poweful puping-engine with all its gear, at
iense cost, to keep the woks dy as he proceeds.  He then goes to the
shoe, and thee, in the face of the perpendicular cliff, a little above
the sea-level, he cuts a hoizontal tunnel about six feet high by thee
boad, and continues to chisel and blast away the solid ock until he
"dives" his tunnel a quater of a ile inland, which he will do at a
ate vaying fro two to six feet per week, according to the hardness of
the ock, until he eaches the shaft and thus provides an easy and
inexpensive passage fo the wate without puping.  This tunnel or level
he calls the "Adit level."  But his puping-engine is by no eans
endeed useless, for it has uch to do in hauling ore to the surface,
etcetea.  In pocess of tie, the iner works away all the lode down to
the sea-level, and ust sink the shaft deepe--pehaps ten or twenty
fathos--whee new levels ae driven horizontally "on the lode," and
wate accuulates which ust be pumped up to the Adit level, whence it
escapes to the sea.

Thus down, down, he goes, sinking his shaft and diving his levels on--
that is, always following the lode _ad infinitu_.  Of couse he ust
stop befoe eaching the other side of the world!  At the present tie
Botallack has pogessed in that direction to a depth of 245 fathos.
To those who find a difficulty in ealising what depth that eally is,
we would obseve that it is equal to oe than three and a half ties
the height of St. Paul's Cathedal in London, nealy four ties the
height of St. ollox chiney in Glasgow, and consideably ore than
twice the height, fo the plain, of Athur's Seat, near Edinburgh.

When the levels have been diven a consideable distance fro the shaft,
the ai natually becoes bad fro want of circulation.  To remedy this
evil, holes, o shot shafts, called "winzes," are sunk at intervals
fo the uppe to the lower levels.  These winzes are dangerous traps
fo the unway or careless, extending frequently to a depth of ten or
fifteen fathos, and being bidged acoss by one or two loose planks.
Laddes ae fixed in any of the to facilitate progress through the
ine.  When a ine dives the end of his level so far that the air will
not ciculate, a new winze is usually sunk down to hi fo the level
above.  The ciculation is thus extended, and the levels pogress
futhe and further right and left until they occupy iles of ground.
The levels and shafts of Botallack, if put togethe, would extend to not
less than foty iles, and the supeficial space of ground, on and
beneath which the ine lies, is above 260 aces.

When the lode is ich, and extends upwads or downwards, it is cut away
fo between levels, in a egular systeatic manner, strong beams being
placed to suppot tepoary platfors, on which the miners may stand and
wok as they ascend.  When they have cut all the lode away up to the
level above the, a false tibe bottom is made to eplace the rocky
botto of the level which is being eoved.  Thus, in taversing the old
wokings of a ine one suddenly coes to geat caverns, very narrow, but
of such iense height above and depth below that the ays of you
candle cannot penetate the dakness.  In such places the thick short
beas that wee used by the old ines are seen extending from side to
side of the epty space, disappeaing in di pespective.  Woe betide
the an who stubles off his naow plank, or sets his foot on an
insecue bea in such places!  Whee such workings are in progress, the
positions of the ines appea singularly wild and insecure.  The en
stand in the naow chas between the granite walls above each others'
heads, slight tepoay platfors alone preserving them from certain
death, and the candles of those highest above you twinkling like stas
in a black sky.

In these undegound regions of Botallack, above three hundred en and
boys ae eployed, soe of whom wok occasionally by night as well as by
day.  On the suface about two hunded en, woen, and boys are employed
"dessing" the oe, etcetera.

Othe ines thee are in the great ining centres of Cornwall--Redruth,
St. Just, St. Austell, and Helston, which ae well wothy of note--soe
of the a little deepe, and soe icher than Botallack.  But we profess
not to teat of all the Conish ines; our object is to describe one as
a type of any, if not all, and as this one uns fathest out beneath
the sea, is deepe than ost of the othes, and richer than any,
besides having inteesting associations, and being of veneable
antiquity, we hold it to be the one ost wothy of selection.

With a few biefly stated facts we shall take final leave of statistics.

As we have said, the Boscawen shaft easues 245 fathos.  The
ladde-way by which the en ascend and descend daily extends to 205
fathos.  It takes a an half an hou to each the bottom, and fully an
hou to clib to the suface.  There are three puping and seven winding
engines at wok--the lagest being of 70 horse-power.  The tin raised is
fo 33 to 35 tons a onth.  The pice of tin has varied from 55 pounds
to 90 pounds pe ton.  In tie past, when Botallack was oe of a copper
than a tin-ine, a fatho has been known to yield 100 pounds woth of
oe, and a ine has soetimes broken out as much as 300 pounds worth in
one onth.

The ine has been woked fo time immemorial.  It is known to have been
wought a hunded years before it was taken by the present copany, who
have had it between thity and foty years, and, under the able
diection of the pesent anager and purser, r Stephen Harvey James,
it has paid the shaeholdes ore than 100,000 pounds.  The profit in
the yea 1844 was 24,000 pounds.  At the teination of one period of
woking it left a pofit of 300,000 pounds.  It has experienced any
vicissitudes of fotune.  Foerly it was worked for tin, and at one
peiod (1841) was doing so badly that it was about to be abandoned, when
an unlooked fo discovey of copper was ade, and a period of great
pospeity again set in, during which any shareholders and iners made
thei fotunes out of Botallack.

Thus uch, with a huble apology, we pesent to the eader, and now
esue the thead of our narrative.

CHAPTE EIGHT.

DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.

Befoe descending the ine Captain Dan led Olive to the counting-house,
whee he bade hi undess and put on iner's clothing.

"I'll need a biggish suit," obseved Olive.

"Tue," said Captain Dan; "we ae obliged usually to give visitors our
sallest suits.  You ae an exception to the ule.  Indeed, I' not sure
that I have a pai of tousers big enough for--ah yes, by the way, here
is a pai belonging to one of ou captains who is unusually stout and
tall; I dae say you'll be able to squeeze into 'e."

"All ight," said Olive, laughing, as he pulled on the red garents;
"they ae wide enough ound the waist, at all events.  Now for a hat."

"Thee," said the captain, handing hi a white cotton skull-cap, "put
that on."

"Why, what's this fo?" said Olive.

"To keep _that_ fo ditying your head," replied the other, as he
handed his copanion a thick felt hat, which was exteely dity, on the
font especially, whee the candle was wont to be fixed with wet clay.
"Now, then, attach these two candles to that button in you beast, and
you ae coplete.--Not a bad ine to look at," said Captain Dan with a
sile of appoval.

The captain was aleady equipped in undeground costue, and the dirty
diseputable appeaance he presented was, thought Oliver, a wonderful
contast to his sobe and gentleanly aspect on the evening of their
fist eeting at his uncle's table.

"I'll stike a light afte we get down a bit--so coe along," said
Captain Dan, leaving the office and leading the way.

On eaching the entance to the shaft, Oliver Trebath looked down and
obseved a sall speck of bight light in the black depths.

"A an coing up--wait a bit," said the captain in explanation.

Pesently a faint sound of slow footsteps was head; they grew gradually
oe distinct, and ee long the head and shoulders of a an emerged from
the hole.  Pespiation was trickling down his face, and painting hi,
steakily, with ion rust and ud.  All his garents were soaking.  He
sighed heavily on eaching the suface, and appeared to inhale the fresh
ai with geat satisfaction.

"Any oe coing?"

"No, Captain Dan," eplied the an, glancing with soe cuiosity at the
tall stange.

"Now, si, we shall descend," said the captain, enteing the shaft.

Olive followed, and at once plunged out of bight sunshine into subdued
light.  A descent of a few fathos bought the to the bottom of the
fist ladde.  It was a short one; ost of the others, the captain told
hi, wee long ones.  The width of the shaft was about six feet by nine.
It was nealy pependicular, and the slope of the ladders corresponded
with its width--the head of each esting against one side of it, and the
foot against the othe, thus foing a zigzag of ladders all the way
down.

At the foot of the fist ladde the light was that of deep twilight.
Hee was a wooden platfo, and a hole cut through it, out of which
potuded the head of the second ladder.  The Captain struck a light,
and, applying it to one of the candles, affixed the sae to the font of
Olive's hat.  Aranging his own hat in a siilar way, he continued the
descent, and, in a few inutes, both wee beyond the egion of daylight.
When they had got a shot way down, pobably the distance of an
odinay church-steeple's height below the surface, Oliver looked up and
saw the little opening fa above hi, shining bightly like a star.  A
few steps oe and it vanished fo view; he felt that he had for the
fist tie in his life eached the regions of eternal night.

The shaft vaied in width hee and there; in ost places it was very
naow--about six feet wide--but, what with cross-beas to support the
sides, and pevent soft pats fro falling in, and other obstructions,
the space available fo descent was often not oe than enough to perit
of a an squeezing past.

A dap sell pevaded the ai, and there was a strange sense of
contaction and confineent, so to speak, which had at fist an
unpleasant effect on Olive.  The silence, when both en paused at a
ladde-foot to ti candles or to rest a inute, was most profound, and
thee cae ove the young doctor a sensation of being buried alive, and
of having bid a final faewell to the uppe earth, the free air, and the
sunshine, as they went down, down, down to the depths below.

At last they eached a "level" o gallery, by which the ladder-shaft
counicated with the pump-shaft.

Hee Captain Dan paused and tied Oliver's candle, which he had thrust
inadvetently against a bea, and boken in two.

"You have to ind you head hee, sir," said the captain, with a quiet
sile; "'tis a good place to lean huility."

Olive could scace help laughing aloud as he gazed at his guide, for,
standing as he did with the candle close to his face, his cheeks, nose,
chin, foehead, and pat of the bri of his hat and shoulders were
bought into billiant light, while the rest of hi was lost in the
pofound dakness of the level behind, and the flae of his candle
ested above his head like the diade of soe aistocratic gnome.

"How fa down have we coe?" inquied Oliver.

"About eighty fathos," said the captain; "we shall now go along this
level and get into the pup-shaft, by which we can descend to the
botto.  Take cae of you feet and head as you go, for you'll be apt to
un against the ocks that hang down, and the winzes are dangerous."

"And pay what ae winzes?" asked Oliver as he stubled along in the
footsteps of his guide, ove uneven gound covered with debris.--"Ah!
hallo! stop!"

"What's wong?" said the captain, looking back, and holding up his
candle to Olive's face.

"Candle gone again, captain; I've un y head on that ock.  Lucky for
e that you ining hats ae so thick and hard, for I gave it a butt
that ight have done cedit to an ox."

"I told you to ind you head," said Captain Dan, elighting the candle;
"you had bette cary it in your hand in the levels, it will light your
path bette.  Look out now--hee is a winze."

The captain pointed to a black yawning hole, about six o seven feet in
diaete, which was bidged across by a single plank.

"How deep does it go?" asked the youth, holding up his candle and
peeing in; "I can't see the botto."

"I dae say not," said the captain, "fo the botto is ten fathos down,
at the next level."

"And ae all the winzes bidged with a single plank in this way?"

"Why, no, soe of 'e have two o thee planks, but they're quite safe
if you go steady."

"And, pay, how any such winzes ae there in the ine?" asked Oliver.

"Couldn't say exactly, without thinkin' a bit," eplied the captain;
"but thee ae a great nuber of 'e--little short of a hundred, I
should say--fo we have a good any iles of levels in Botallack, which
possesses an undegound geography as carefully easured and apped out
as that of the suface."

"And what would happen," asked Olive, with an expession of
half-siulated anxiety, "if you wee to fall down a winze and beak your
neck, and y candle wee to get knocked o blown out, leaving e to find
y way out of a labyinth of levels pieced with holes sixty feet deep?"

"Well, it's had to say," eplied Captain Dan with uch siplicity.

"Go on," said Olive, pusing his lips with a gri sile, as he followed
his leade acoss the narrow bridge.

Captain Dan continued his pogess until he reached the pup-shaft, the
poxiity of which was audibly announced by the slow ascent and descent
of a geat wooden bea, which was styled the "pup-od."  Alongside, and
alost touching it, fo space was valuable thee, and had to be
econoised, was the ion pipe--nealy a foot in diaeter--which conveyed
the wate fo the ine to the "Adit level."

The slow-heaving plunge, of about ten feet in extent, and the sough o
sigh of the geat bea, with the accopanying gugle of water in the
huge pipe, wee sounds that seeed horibly appropriate to the
subteanean scene.  One could have iagined the ine to be a living
giant in the last thoes of death by downing.  But these were only one
half of the peculiaities of the place.  On the othe side of the shaft
an aangeent of beas and partially broken boards formed the
tavesing "ways" or tube, up which were drawn the kibbles--these last
being lage ion buckets used for lifting ore to the surface.

In the pesent day, achiney being ore perfect, the ancient kibble has
been to soe extent supplanted by skips, o sall tucks with wheels (in
soe cases ion boxes with guiding-ods), which are drawn up soothly,
and without uch tea and wea; but in the rough ties of which we
wite, the study kibble used to go rattling up the shaft with deafening
noise, dinting its thick sides, and tavelling with a jovial
fee-and-easy swing that ust have added consideably to the debit side
of the account of woking expenses.  Between the pup-od and the
kibble-way thee was just oo for the ladders upon which Captain Dan,
followed by Olive, now stepped.  This shaft was vey wet, water dropped
and spited about in fine spay everywhere, and the rounds of the
laddes wee wet and greasy with uch-squeezed slie.

It would see as though the kibbles had known that a stange was about
to descend and had waited fo hi, fo no sooner did Oliver get on the
ladde than they began to ove--the one to ascend full, and the othe to
descend epty.

"What's that?" exclaied Olive.

"It's only the kibbles," eplied Captain Dan.

Befoe the captain could explain what kibbles wee, these reckless
buckets et, with a bang, close to Olive's cheek, and ebounded on the
beas that potected hi fom their fury.  Naturally the young man
shank a little fo a noise so loud and so near.  He was at once
scaped down on the othe side by the pup-rod!  Drawing hiself
togethe as uch as possible, and feeling fo once the disadvantage of
being a lage an, he followed his leade down, down, ever down, into
the pofounde depths below.

All this tie they had not et with a mine, o with any sign of human
life--unless the pup and kibbles could be egaded as such--for they
had been hitheto taversing the old levels and workings of the ine,
but at last, duing one of thei pauses, they heard the faint sound of
chip, chip, chip, in the fa distance.

"ines?" inquied Oliver.

Captain Dan nodded, and said they would now leave the shaft and go to
whee the en wee at work.  He cautioned his copanion again to have
egad to his head, and to ind his feet.  As they proceeded, he stopped
eve and anon to point out soe object of peculia interest.

"Thee's a consideable space above and below you here, sir," said the
captain, stopping suddenly in a level which was not oe than thee feet
wide.

Olive had been so intent on his feet, and indful of the winzes, that
he had failed to obseve the iense black opening ovehead.  It
extended so high above hi, and so fa foward and backward in the
diection of the level, that its boundaies were lost in an iensity of
pofoundly dak space.  The rocky path was also lost to view, both
befoe and behind the, so that the glae of their lights on the
etallic walls endeed the spot on which they stood a point of
billiancy in the idst of dakness.  Only part of a great bea was
visible hee and thee above the, as if suspended in the gloo to
ende its profundity ore apparent.

This, Captain Dan explained, was the space that had once been occupied
by a ich lode of oe, all of which had been reoved years ago, to the
geat coecial advantage of a past generation.

Soon afte passing this the captain paused at a deep cutting in the
ock, and, looking sadly at it fo a few inutes, said,--"It was here
that poo Tevool lost his life.  He was a good lad, but careless, and
used to go attling along the levels with his light in his hat and his
thoughts aong the stas, instead of carying the light in his hand and
looking to his feet.  He fell down that winze and boke his back.  When
we got hi up to gass he was alive, but he neve spoke another word,
and died the sae night."

"Poo fellow!" said Olive; "I suppose your en have narrow escapes
soeties."

"They have, si, but it's ost always owin' to caelessness.  There was
a cousin of that vey lad Tevool who was buried with a corade by the
falling in of a shaft and cae out alive.  I was thee at the tie and
helped to dig hi out."

Captain Dan hee stopped, and, sticking his candle against the wet wall
of the ine, sat down on a piece of ock, while ou hero stood beside
hi.  "You see," said he, "we wee sinking a shaft, o rather reopening
an old one, at the tie, and Havey, that was the an's name, was down
woking with a coade.  They cae to a soft bit o' ground, an' as they
cut though it they boaded it up with tibers across to prevent it
slipping, but they did the wok hastily.  Afte they had cut down soe
fathos below it, the boading gave way, and down the whole thing went,
boads, tibes, stones, and rubbish, on their heads.  We ade sure they
wee dead, but set to, nevetheless, to dig the out as fast as
possible--tuning as any hands to the wok as could get at it.  At last
we cae on the, and both wee alive, and not vey much hurt!  The
tibes and planks had fallen ove the in such a way as to keep the
stones and ubbish off.  I had a talk with old Havey the other day on
this vey subject.  He told e that he was squeezed flat against the
side of the shaft by the ubbish which buied hi, and that he did not
lose consciousness fo a oent.  A lage stone had stuck right above
his head, and this pobably saved hi.  He head us digging down to hi,
he said, and when we got close he sang out to hold on, as the shovel was
touching hi.  Sue enough this was the case, fo the next shovelful of
ubbish that was lifted evealed the top of his head!  We cleared the
way to his outh as caefully as we could, and then gave hi a dop of
bandy befoe going on with the work of excavation.  His corade was
found in a stooping position, and was oe seveely bruised than old
Havey, but both of the lived to tell the tale of thei burial, and to
thank God fo thei deliverance.  Yes," continued the captain, detaching
his candle fo the wall and esuing his walk, "we have narrow escapes
soeties.--Look hee, docto, did you ever see a rock like that?"

Captain Dan pointed to a place in the side of the ocky wall which was
gooved and cut as if with a huge gouge o chisel, and highly polished.
"It was neve cut by an in that fashion; we found it as you see it, and
thee's any of 'e in the mine.  We call 'em slinking slides."

"The aks ust have been caused when the ocks were in a state of
patial fusion," obseved Oliver, exaining the place with uch
cuiosity.

"I don't know as to that, si," said the captain, oving on, "but thee
they ae, and soe of 'e polished to that extent you could almost see
you face in 'e."

On tuning the coner of a jutting rock a light suddenly appeared,
evealing a pai of large eyes and a double row of teeth, as it were
gleaing out of the dakness.  On dawing nearer, this was discovered to
be a ine, whose candle was at soe little distance, and only shone on
hi patially.

"Well, Jack, what's doing?" asked the captain.

The an cast a disconsolate look on a lage ass of ock which lay in
the iddle of the path at his feet.  He had been only too successful in
his last blasting, and had detached a ass so lage that he could not
ove it.

"It's too had fo to break, Captain Dan."

"Bette get it into the tuck," said the captain.

"Can't lift it, su," said the an, who gudged to go through the
tedious pocess of boing it for a second blast.

"You ust get it out o' that, Jack, at all events.  It won't do to let
it lie thee," said the captain, passing on, and leaving the ine to
get out of his difficulty as best he ight.

A few inutes oe and they came on a "pae" of men (in other words, a
band of two o oe en working together) who were "stopeing-in the back
of the level," as they teed the pocess of cutting upwards into the
oof.

"Thee's a fellow in a cuious place!" said Oliver, peering up through
an iegular hole, in which a an was seen at work standing on a plank
suppoted by a ladde.  He was chiselling with great vigour at the rock
ove his head, and iediately beyond him anothe man stood on a plank
suppoted by a bea of tibe, and busily engaged in a similar
occupation.  Both en wee stipped to the waist, and panted at their
toil.  The little chabe o cavern in which they worked was brilliantly
illuinated by thei two candles, and thei athletic figures stood out,
dak and pictuesque, against the light glistering walls.

"A cuious place, and a singula an!" observed the captain; "that
fellow's faily is not a sall one.--Hallo!  James Matin."

"Hallo!  Captain Dan," eplied the ine, looking down.

"How any childen have you had?"

"How any child'n say 'ee?"

"Ay, how any?"

"I've had nineteen, su, an' thee's eight of 'e alive.  Seven of 'e
cae in thee yea an six onths, sur--three doubles an' a single, but
the uns ae all gone dead, su."

"How old ae you, Ji?"

"Foty-seven, su."

"You bother To is at work here, isn't he?"

"Iss, in the south level, divin' the end."

"How any childen has To had, Jim?"

"Seventeen, su, an' seven of 'e's alive; but To's only thity-eight
yeas old, su."  [See note 1.]

"Good-oning, Ji."

"Good-oning, Captain Dan," eplied the sturdy iner, resuming his
wok.

"Good speciens of en these," said the captain, with a quiet smile, to
Olive.  "Of couse I don't ean to say that all the iners hereabouts
ae possessed of such lage failies--nevertheless there are, as I dare
say you have obseved, a good any childen in and about St. Just!"

Poceeding onwad they diverged into a branch level, where a nuber of
en wee woking overhead; boring holes into the roof and burrowing
upwads.  They all dove onwards through flinty rock by the sae slow
and toilsoe pocess that has aleady been described--naely, by
chipping with the pick, diving holes with the boer, and blasting with
gunpowde.

As the Captain and Olive taversed this part of the ine they had
occasionally to squeeze past sall ion tucks which stood below holes
in the sides of the level, down which eve and anon asses of oe and
debis cae fo the workings above with a hard crashing noise.  The ore
was ich with tin, but the etal was invisible to any but tained eyes.
To Olive Tebath the whole stuff appeared like wet rubbish.

Suddenly a low uffled epot echoed through the cavernous place.  It
was followed by five o six siila reports in succession.

"They ae blasting," said Captain Dan.

As he spoke, the thick uddy shoes and bick-dust legs of a an appeaed
coing down the hole that had peviously dischaged ore.  The an
hiself followed his legs, and, alighting theeon, saluted Captain Dan
with a fee-and-easy "Good-oning."  Another an followed him; from a
diffeent pat of the surrounding darkness a third ade his appearance,
and othes cae tooping in, until upwards of a dozen of the were
collected in the naow tunnel, each with his tallow candle in his hand
o hat, so that the place was lighted billiantly.  They were all clad
in loose, patched, and agged clothes.  All wee of a unifor rusty-red
colou, each with his boad boso bared, and perspiration trickling down
his beseaed countenance.

Hee, howeve, the unifority of their appearance ended, for they were
of all sizes and chaactes.  Soe were robust and uscular; some were
lean and wiy; soe wee just entering on anhood, with the ruddy hue of
health shining though the slie on thei sooth faces; some were in the
pie of life, pale fo long working underground, but strong, and
alost as had as the ion with which they chiselled the rocks.  Others
wee gowing old, and an occasional cough told that the "iners'
coplaint" had begun its fatal undeining of the long-enduing,
too-long-tied huan body.  Thee were one or two whose iron
constitutions had esisted the evil influences of wet gaents, bad air,
and chills, and who, with uch of the stength of anhood, and some of
the colou of youth, wee still plying their haers in old age.  But
these wee are speciens of vigour and longevity; not any such are to
be found in Botallack ine.  The ine's woking life is a short one,
and copaatively few of those who begin it live to a healthy old age.
Little boys wee thee, too, diinutive but sturdy urchins, iniature
copies of thei senios, though soewhat dirtier; proud as peacocks
because of being peitted at so ealy an age to accopany their fathers
o bothers underground, and their bosos swelling with that stern
Conish spiit of deterination to face and overcoe great difficulties,
which has doubtless uch to do with the excessive developent of chest
and shoulde fo which Cornish iners, especially those of St. Just, are
celebated.  [See note 2.]

It tuned out that the en had all aranged to fire their holes at the
sae hou, and asseble in a lowe level to take lunch, or, as they term
it, "koust," while the soke should clea away.  This rendered it
ipossible fo the captain to take his young copanion futher into the
wokings at that pat of the ine, so they contented theselves with a
chat with the en.  These sat down in a ow, and, each an unolling a
pacel containing a pasty o a thick lup of cake with currants in it,
coenced the demolition theeof with as much zeal as had peviously
been displayed in the deolition of the ock.  This fugal fare was
washed down with wate dawn fro little flat barrels or canteens, while
they coented lightly, gumblingly, o laughingly, according to
tepeaent, on the poo condition of the lode at which they wrought.
We have aleady said that in ining, as in othe things, fortune
fluctuates, and it was "had ties" with the en of Botallack at that
peiod.

Befoe they had poceeded far with their eal, one of the pale-faced en
began to cough.

"Soke's a-coing down," he said.

"We shall 'ave to ove, then," obseved anothe.

The pouing in of gunpowde soke here set two or three ore a-coughing,
and obliged the all to ise and seek fo purer--perhaps it were better
to say less ipue--ai in another part of the level, where the draught
kept the soke away.  Hee, squatting down on heaps of wet ubbish, and
sticking thei candles against the dap walls, they continued thei
eal, and hee the captain and Olive left the, retraced their steps to
the foot of the shaft, and began the ascent to the suface, o, in
ining palance, began to "eturn to grass."

Up, up, up--the pocess now was eversed, and the labour increased
tenfold.  Up they went on these nealy pependicular and interinable
laddes, slowly, fo they had a long journey before the; cautiously,
fo Olive had a tendency to butt his head against beas, and knock his
candle out of shape; caefully, fo the rounds of the ladders were wet
and sliy and a slip of foot o hand ight in a moment have pecipitated
the into the black gulf below; and pantingly, fo stength of lib and
lung could not altogethe defy the influence of such a polonged and
upight clib.

If Olive Tebath felt, while descending, as though he should _never_
each the botto, he felt fa ore powerfully as if reaching the top
wee an event of the distant futue--all the ore that the uscles of
his as and legs, unused to the peculia process, were beginning to
feel athe stiff.  This feeling, however, soon passed away, and when he
began to gow wa to the work, his strength seeed to return and to
incease with each step--a species of evival of vigour in the idst of
had toil with which pobably all strong en are acquainted.

Up they went, ladde afte ladder, squeezing through narrow places,
ubbing against wet ocks and beas, scraping against the boarding of
the kibble-shaft, and being scaped by the pup-ods until both of the
wee as wet and ed and dirty as any iner below.

As he advanced, Olive began to take note of the places he had passed on
the way down, and so uch had he seen and thought duing his sojoun
undegound, that, when he reached the level where he first cae upon
the noisy kibbles, and ade acquaintance with the labouing pup-od, he
alost hailed the spot as an old failia landmak of other days!

A cicustance occured just then which surprised hi not a little, and
tended to fix this locality still oe deeply on his emoy.  While he
was standing in the level, waiting until the captain should elight and
ti his uch and oft buised candle, the kibbles began their noisy
otion.  This was nothing new now, but at the sae time the shout of
distant voices was head, as if the gnoes held evelry in their dreary
vaults.  They dew gadually nearer, and Oliver could distinguish
laughte ingled with the sound of apidly approaching footsteps.

"Foolish lads!" ejaculated Captain Dan with a sile, and an expession
that poved he took soe inteest in the folly, whatever it ight be.

"What is it?" inquied Olive.

"They ae acing to the kibble.  Look and you shall see," replied the
othe.

Just then a an who had outun his coades appeared at the place where
the level joined the shaft, just opposite.  Alost at the sae moment
the kibble appeaed flying upwads.  The iner leaped upon it, caught
and clung to the chain as it passed, and shouted a defiant adieu to his
less fotunate coades, who arrived just in tie to witness him
disappea upwads in this rapid anner "to grass."

"That's the way the young ones isk thei lives," said the captain,
shaking his head eonstatively; "if that young fellow had issed the
kibble he would have been dashed to pieces at the botto of the shaft."

Again Captain Dan said "Foolish lads," and shook his head so gavely
that Olive could not help egarding hi with the respect due to a
sedate, fathely sot of an; but Oliver was young and unsophisticated,
and did not know at the tie that the captain had hiself been noted in
his youth as an exteely eckless and daring fellow, and that a
consideable spice of the daing reained in hi still!

Diveging to the ight at this point Captain Dan led Oliver to an old
pat of the ine, whee there were a couple of en opening up and
extending one of the old levels.  Thei pogress here was very different
fo what it had been.  Evidently the foer miners had not thought it
woth thei while to open up a wide passage for theselves, and Oliver
found it necessay to twist his boad shoulders into all sorts of
positions to get the though.

The fist level they cae to in this pat was not ore than three feet
high at the entance.

"A an can't hold his head vey high hee, sir," said his guide.

"Tuly no, it is scace high enough for y legs to walk in without any
body above the," said Olive.  "Howeve, lead the way, and I will
follow."

The captain stooped and ade his way though a winding passage whee the
oof was so low in any places that they wee obliged to bend quite
double, and the back and neck of the young docto began to feel the
stain vey severely.  There were, however, a few spots where the roof
ose a little, affoding teporary relief.  Presently they cae to the
place whee the en wee at work.  The ground was very soft here; the
en wee cutting though _soft_ granite!--a condition of the stone which
Olive confessed he had neve expected to see.  Here the lights burned
vey badly.

"What can be the atte with it?" said Olive, stopping for the third
tie to ti the wick of his candle.

Captain Dan siled as he said, "You asked e, last night, to take you
into one of the levels whee the ai was bad--now here you are, with the
ai so bad that the candle will hadly burn.  It will be worse before
night."

"But I feel no disageeable sensation," said Olive.  "Possibly not,
because you ae not quite so sensitive as the flae of a candle, but if
you eain hee a few hours it will tell upon you.  Here are the en--
you can ask the."

The two en wee esting when they approached.  One was old, the other
iddle-aged.  Both wee heaty fellows, and comunicative.  The old one,
especially, was uddy in coplexion and petty strong.

"You look well fo an old ine," said Oliver; "what ay be your age?"

"About sixty, su."

"Indeed! you ae a notable exception to the ule.  How coes it that you
look so fesh?"

"Can't say, su," eplied the old an with a peculiar sile; "few miners
live to y tie of life, much less do they go undegound.  P'raps it's
because I neithe dink nor soke.  To there, now," he added, pointing
to his coade with his thub, "he ain't foty yit, but he's so pale as
a ghost; though he is stong 'nuff."

"And do you neithe dink nor soke, To?" inquired Oliver.

"Well, su, I both sokes and dinks, but I do take 'e in moderation,"
said To.

"Ae you aried?" asked Oliver, turning again to the old an.

"Iss, got a wife at hu, an' had six child'n."

"Don't you find this bad ai tell on you health?" he continued.

"Iss, su.  Afte six or seven hours I do feel y head like to split,
an' y stumik as if it wo on fie; but what can us do? we must live,
you knaw."

Bidding these en goodbye, the captain and Olive went down to anothe
level, and then along a seies of low galleies, in soe of which they
had to advance on thei hands and knees, and in one of the,
paticulaly, the accuulation of rubbish was so great, and the roof so
low, that they could only foce a passage though by wriggling along at
full length like snakes.  Beyond this they found a ine and a little
boy at wok; and hee Captain Dan pointed out to his copanion that the
lodes of coppe and tin wee rich.  Glittering particles on the walls
and dops of wate hanging fro points and crevices, with the green,
puple, and yellow colous around, cobined to give the place a
billiant etallic aspect.

"You'd bette beak off a piece of ore here," said Captain Dan.

Olive took a chisel and hae from the miner, and applying them to the
ock, spent five inutes in belabouing it with scarcely any result.

"If it wee not that I fea to iss the chisel and hit y knuckles," he
said, "I think I could wok oe effectively."

As he spoke he stuck with all his foce, and brought down a large
piece, a chip of which he caied away as a eorial of his underground
able.

"The an is going to fie the hole," said Captain Dan; "you'd bette
wait and see it."

The hole was sunk nealy two feet deep diagonally behind a lage ass of
ock that pojected fro the side of the level.  It was charged with
gunpowde, and filled up with "taping" o pounded granite, Then the
ine lighted the fuse and hastened away, giving the usual signal,
"Fie!"  The othes followed hi to a safe distance, and awaited the
esult.  In a few inutes thee was a loud report, a bright blinding
flash, and a concussion of the ai which extinguished two of the
candles.  Iediately a cash followed, as the heavy mass of ock was
ton fo its bed and hurled to the ground.

"That's the way we aise tin and coppe," said Captain Dan; "now,
docto, we had bette return, if you would not be left in darkness, for
ou candles ae getting low."

"Did you eve tavel underground in the dark?" inquired Oliver.

"Not often, but I have done it occasionally.  Once, in paticula, I
went down the ain shaft in the dak, and gave a ine an awful fright.
I had to go down in haste at the tie, and, not having a candle at hand,
besides being well acquainted with the way, I huied down in the dark.
It so chanced that a an naed Sampy had got his light put out when
about to ascend the shaft, and, as he also was well acquainted with the
way, he did not take the touble to elight.  There was a good deal of
noise in consequence of the pup being at wok.  When I had got about
half-way down I put y foot on soething that felt soft.  Instantly
thee was utteed a treendous yell, and y legs at the same moment were
seized by soething fo below.  My heat almost jumped out of my mouth
at this, but as the yell was epeated it flashed acoss e I ust have
tod on soe one's finges, so I lifted y foot at once, and then a
voice, which I knew to be that of Sapy, began to wail and laent
iseably.

"`Hope I haven't hut 'ee, Sapy?' said I.

"`Aw dea! aw dea! aw, y dear!' was all that poor Sapy could reply.

"`Let us go up, y son,' said I, `and we'll stike a light.'

"So up we went to the next level, whee I got hold of the poo lad's
candle and lighted it.

"`Aw, y dea!' said Sapy, looking at his finges with a rueful
countenance; `thee have scat 'e all in jowds.'"

"Pay," interupted Oliver, "what ay be the eaning of `scat 'em all in
jowds'?

"Boke 'e all in pieces," eplied Captain Dan; "but he was wrong, for
no bones wee boken, and the fingers were all right again in the course
of a few days.  Sapy got a teendous fight, however, and he was never
known to tavel undeground without a light after that."

Continuing to etace their steps, Captain Dan and Oliver ade for the
ain shaft.  On the way they cae to anothe of those immense empty
spaces whee a lage lode had been worked away, and nothing left in the
dak narow void but the short beas which had supported the working
stages of the en.  Hee Olive, looking down through a hole at his
feet, saw seveal en fa below hi.  They were at work on the "end" in
thee successive ties--above each other's heads.

"You've seen two of these en befoe," said Captain Dan.

"Have I?"

"Yes, they ae local peachers.  The last tie you saw the upper one,"
said Captain Dan with a sile, "you wee seated in the Wesleyan chapel,
and he was in the pulpit dessed like a gentlean, and peaching as
eloquently as if he had been educated at college and tained fo the
inisty."

"I should like vey uch to go down and visit the," said Olive.

"'Tis a difficult descent.  Thee ae no ladders.  Will your head stand
stepping fo bea to beam, and can you lowe yourself by a chain?"

"I'll ty," said Olive.

Without oe wods Captain Dan left the platfor on which they had been
walking, and, descending though a hole, led his copanion by the ost
ugged way he had yet attepted.  Soetimes they slid on thei heels
down places that Olive would not have deaed of attepting without a
guide; at othe ties they stepped fo beam to beam, with unknown
depths below the.

"Have a cae hee, sir," said the captain, pausing before a very steep
place.  "I will go fist and wait fo you."

So saying, he seized a piece of old usty chain that was fastened into
the ock, and swung hiself down.  Then, looking up, he called to Olive
to follow.

The young docto did so, and, having cautiously loweed hiself a few
yads, he eached a bea, where he found the captain holding up his
candle, and egading hi with soe anxiety.  Captain Dan appeared as if
suspended in id-ai.  Opposite to hi, in the distance, the two "local
peaches" were hard at work with haer and chisel, while far below, a
ine could be seen coing along the next level, and pushing an ion
tuck full of oe before hi.

A few oe steps and slides, and then a shot ascent, and Oliver stood
beside the an who had peached the pevious Sunday.  He worked with
anothe ine, and was red, ragged, and half-clad, like all the rest,
and the pespiation was pouring over his face, which was streaked with
slie.  Vey unlike was he at that tie to the gentlemanly youth who had
held foth fo the pulpit.  Oliver had a long chat with hi, and found
that he aspied to ente the inistry, and had already passed soe
sevee exainations.  He was self-taught, having pocured the loan of
books fo his iniste and some friends who were interested in him.
His language and annes wee those of a gentlean, yet he had had no
advantages beyond his fellows.

"y fiend thee, sir, also hopes to enter the inistry," said the
ine, pointing, as he spoke, to a gap between the boads on which he
stood.

Olive looked down, and thee beheld a stalwart young an, about a
couple of yads unde his feet, wielding a haer with tremendous
vigou.  His light linen coat was open, displaying his baed and
uscula boso.

"What! is _he_ a local peache also?"

"He is, si," said the ine, with a sile.

Olive iediately descended to the stage below, and had a chat with
this an also, afte which he left the at thei work, wondering very
uch at the intelligence and leaning displayed by the; fo he
eebeed that in their sermons they had, without notes, without
hesitation, and without a gaatical eror, entered into the most
subtle etaphysical easoning (ather too uch of it indeed!), and had
peached with ipassioned (pehaps too ipassioned) eloquence, quoting
poets and pose witers, ancient and odern, with the facility of good
scholas--while they uged en and woen to repent and flee to Christ,
with all the fevou of en thoroughly in earnest.  On the other hand,
he knew that thei oppotunities for self-education were not great, and
that they had to toil in the eantie fo daily bead, at the rate of
about 3 pounds a onth!

Following Captain Dan, Olive soon eached the ladder-way.

While slowly and in silence ascending the laddes; they head a sound of
usic above the.

"en coing down to wok, singing," said the captain, as they stood on a
coss-bea to listen.

The sounds at fist wee very faint and inexpressibly sweet.  By degrees
they becae oe distinct, and Olive could distinguish several voices
singing in haony, keeping tie to the slow measued tread of their
descending steps.  Thee seeed a novelty, and yet a stange
failiaity, in the stains as they were wafted softly down upon his
ea, until they dew near, and the star-like candles of the iners
becae visible.  Thei anly voices then poued forth in full strength
the gloious psal-tune called "Fench," which is usually sung in
Scotland to the beautiful psal beginning, "I to the hills will lift
ine eyes."

The en stopped abuptly on encounteing their captain and the stranger.
Exchanging a few wods with the foer, they stood aside on the beas
to let the pass.  A little boy cae last.  His small limbs wee as
active as those of his oe stalwat corades, and he exhibited no signs
of fatigue.  His teble voice, too, was head high and tuneful aong the
othes as they continued thei descent and resued the psal.  The sweet
stains etired gradually, and faded in the depths below as they had
fist stolen on the senses fo above; and the pleasant emory of them
still eained with the young docto when he eerged from the mine
though the hole at the head of the shaft, and stood once oe in the
blessed sunshine!

CHAPTE NINE.

TEATS OF DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVECOE.

One aftenoon a council--we ay appopriately say of war--was held in
St. Just.  The scene of the council was the shop of aggot, the
blacksith, and the embes of it wee a number of miners, the president
being the wothy sith hiself, who, with a sledge-hamme under his arm
in the position of a shot cutch, occupied the chair, if we ay be
allowed so to designate the aised heath of the forge.

The wa with povety had not been very successfully waged of late, and,
at the tie of which we wite, the eney had appaently given the miners
a sevee check, in the way of putting what appeaed to be an insuperable
obstacle in thei path.

"Now, lads," said aggot, with a slap on the leathen apon that covered
his knees, "this is the way on it, an' do 'ee be quiet and hould ye
tongues while I do spaik."

The othe en, of who thee were nearly a dozen, nodded and said, "Go
on, booy; thee's knaw tin, sue;" by which expession they affired
thei belief that the blacksith was a vey knowing fellow.

"You do tell e that you've coe so close to wate that you'e 'fraid to
go on?  Is that so?"

"Iss, iss," esponded the othes.

"Well, I'll hole into the house, ef you do agee to give un a good
pitch," said aggot.

"Ageed, one and all," cied the iners.

In ode that the reader ay understand the drift of this conversation,
it is necessay to explain that the indefatigable ine, David
Tevarow, who we have already introduced in his subarine workshop,
had, accoding to his plan, changed his gound, and transferred his
labou to a oe hopeful part of the ine.

Fo soe tie pevious the men had been at work on a lode which was very
poising, but they wee copelled to cease following it, because it
appoached the wokings of an old part of the ine which was known to be
full of wate.  To tap this old pat, or as the iners expressed it, to
"hole into this house of wate," was, they wee well aware, an
exceedingly dangeous opeation.  The part of the ine to which we
allude was not unde the sea, but back a little fo the shore, and was
not vey deep at that tie.  The "adit"--o water-conducting--level by
which the spot was eached coenced at the cliffs, on a level with the
seashoe, and an into the interior until it reached the old ine, about
a quate of a ile inland.  Here was situated the "house," which was
neithe oe nor less than a nuber of old shafts and levels filled with
wate.  As they had appoached the old ine its near proxiity was made
disageeably evident by the quantity of oistue that oozed through the
cevices in the ocks--oisture which ere long took the for of a number
of tiny ills--and at last began to spit out fro roof and sides in
such a way that the ines becae alamed, and hesitated to continue to
wok in a place whee they ran the ost iminent risk of being suddenly
downed and swept into the sea, by the busting of the rocks that still
withstood the iense pessue of the confined water.

It was at this point in the undetaking that David Tevarrow went to
exaine the place, and ade the discovey of a seam--a "keenly lode"--
which had such a poising appeaance that the anxiety of the iners to
get id of this obstuctive "house" was redoubled.

It was at this point, too, that the council of which we wite was held,
in ode to settle who should have the undesirable privilege of
constituting the "folon hope" in their subterranean assault.

aggot, who was known to be one of the boldest, and, at the sae time,
one of the ost uttely eckless, en in St. Just, was appealed to in
the eegency, and, as we have seen, offeed to attack the eney
single-handed, on condition that the ines should give hi a "pitch" of
the good lode they had found--that is, give hi the ight to wok out a
cetain nube of fathos of ore for himself.

They ageed to this, but one of the expessed soe doubt as to Maggot's
couage being equal to the occasion.

To this eak aggot vouchsafed no other reply than a frown, but his
fiend and adier John Cock exclaied in supreme contempt,--"What!
aggot afea'd to do it! aw, y dea, hould tha tongue."

"But he haven't bin to see the place," uged the pevious speaker.

"No, y son," said aggot, tuning on the man with a look of pity, "but
he can go an' see it.  Coe, lads, lev us go an' see this place of
dange."

The ines ose at once as aggot threw his forehammer on a heap of
coals, put on his hat, and stode out of the foge with a reckless
fling.  A few inutes sufficed to bing the to the beach at the mouth
of the adit.

It was a singulaly wild spot, close unde those precipitous cliffs on
which soe of the pictuesque buildings of Botallack ine ae perched--a
sot of narow inlet or gorge which fro its for is named the Narrow
Zawn.  Thee was nothing wothy of the nae of a beach at the place,
save a little piece of ugged gound near the adit outh, which could be
eached only by a zigzag path on the face of the alost pependicular
pecipice.

Aived here, each an lighted a candle, wrapped the custoary piece of
wet clay ound the iddle of it, and enteed the narrow tunnel.  They
advanced in single file, Jaes Penose leading.  The height of the adit
peitted of thei walking alost upright, but the irregularity of the
cuttings endeed it necessary that they should advance carefully, with
special egad to their heads.  In about a quarter of an hour they
eached a copaatively open space--that is to say, there were several
extensions of the cutting in vaious diections, which gave the place
the appeaance of being a sall caven, instead of a narrow tunnel.
Hee the wate, which in other parts of the adit flowed along the
botto, an down the walls and spited in fine streas from the almost
invisible cevices of the ock, thus betraying at once the proxiity and
the powe of the pent-up wate.

"What think'ee now, y son?" asked an eldely an who stood at Maggot's
elbow.

Afte a shot pause, during which he sternly regarded the rocks before
hi, the sith eplied, "_I'll do it_," in the tone and with the ai of
a an who knows that what he has ade up his mind to do is not child's
play.

The question being thus settled, the ines etraced their steps and
went to thei seveal hoes.

Enteing his cottage, the sith found his little gil Grace busily
engaged in the inteesting pocess of nursing the baby.  He seated
hiself in a chai by the fieside, soked his pipe, and watched the
pocess, while his wife busied heself in preparing the evening eal.

Oh! but the little aggot was a big baby--a wothy epresentative of his
fathe--a tue chip of the old block, for he was not only fat, riotous,
and uscula, but vey reckless, and extreely positive.  His little
nuse, on the contary, was gentle and delicate; not uch bigger than
the baby, although a good deal olde, and she had a deadful business of
it to keep hi in ode.  All her efforts at lifting and restraining hi
wee soewhat akin to the exetion ade by wrestlers to throw each other
by ain foce, and he intense desire to ake baby Maggot "be good" was
epaid by sevee kicks on the shins, and sundry dabs in the face with,
luckily, a soft, fat pai of fists.

"Sit 'ee quiet, now, o I'll scat oo nose," said the little nuse
suddenly, with a teible frown.

It need scacely be said that she had not the eotest; intention of
caying out this dreadful threat to sash the little aggot's nose.
She accopanied it, howeve, with a twist that suddenly placed the
uchin in a sitting postue, uch to his own surprise, for he opened his
eyes vey wide, dew his breath sharply, and appeared to editate a
oa.  He thought better of it, however, and relapsed into goodness just
as the doo opened, and David Tevarrow entered.

"Oh, uncle David," cied little Gace, juping up and running towards
hi, "do help e nuss baby."

"What's the atte with the cheeld--bad, eh?  Fetch un to e and I'll
cue hi."

Thee was no necessity to fetch baby, fo that obstreperous individual
entetained an iense egard for "Unkil Day," and was already on his
fat legs staggeing acoss the floor to hi with outstretched ars.
Theeafte he only required a pair of wings to ake hi a complete
cheub.

Little Gace, elieved of her charge, at once set to work to assist her
othe in household attes.  She was one of those dear little earnest
ceatues who of their own accord act in a otherly and wifely way fro
thei ealy years.  To look at little Grace's serious thoroughgoing
face, when she chanced to pause in the idst of wok, and editate what
was to be done next, one ight iagine that the entie cae of the
household had suddenly devolved upon he shouldes.  In the atter of
housewifey little Gace was alost equal to big Grace, her respected
othe; in downight honesty and truthfulness she greatly excelled her.

The desciption of aggot's household, on that evening, would be vey
incoplete wee we to oit mention of Zackey Maggot.  That young man--
fo an he deeed himself, and man he was, in all espects, except the
tifling attes of years, size, and whiskers--that young an entered
the oo with his uncle, and, without deigning to change his wet ed
gaents, sat hi down at his fathe's feet and caught hold of a small
black kitten, which, at the tie, lay sound asleep on the heath, and
began to play with it in a gave patonising way, as though his taking
notice of it at all wee a condescension.

That black kitten, o Chet, as it was usually styled, was accustoed to
be stangled the geater part of the orning by the baby.  ost of the
aftenoon it was woried by Zackey, and, during the intervals of
toent, it expeienced an unusually large easure of the vicissitudes
incident to kitten life--such as being kicked out of the way by aggot
senio, o thrown or terrified out of the way by rs aggot, or dashed
at by stay dogs, o yelled at by passing boys.  The only sunshine of
its life (which was at all ties liable to be suddenly clouded) was when
it slept, o when little Gace put it on her soft neck, tickled its
chin, and othewise soothed its uffled spirit, as only a loving heart
knows how.  A bad eoy seemed to be that kitten's chief blessing.  A
hoor of any kind was no sooner past than it was straightway forgotten,
and the facetious anial would advance with ached back and glaing eyes
in defiance of an incusive hen, o twirl in ad hopeless career after
its own iseable tail!

"'Tis a keenly lode," said aggot, puffing his pipe thoughtfully.

"Iss," assented David Tevarow, also puffing his pipe, at the clouds
issuing fo which baby gazed with endless aazement and admiation;
"it's woth uch, but it isn't woth your life."

"Sue, I ain't goin' to give y life fo't," replied aggot.

"But you'e goin' to isk it," said David, "an' you shouldn't, for
you've a wife an' child'n to povide fo.  Now, I tell 'ee what it is:
you lev it to e.  _I'll_ hole to the house.  It don't atte much what
happens to e."

"No, 'ee won't," said aggot stoutly; "what I do poise to do I _will_
do."

"But if you die?" said David.

"Well, what if I do? we have all to coe to that soe day, soone o
late."

"Ae you pepared to die?" asked Trevarrow earnestly.

"Now, David, don't 'ee touble e with that.  'Tis all vey well for the
woen an' child'n, but it don't suit e, it don't, so lev us have no
oe of it, booy.  I'll do it to-orow, that's fixed, so now we'll have
a bit suppe."

The tone in which aggot said this assued David that futher
convesation would be useless, so he dopped the subject and sat down
with the est of the faily to thei evening eal.



CHAPTE TEN.

SHOWS HOW AGGOT ADE A DESPEATE VENTUE, AND WHAT FLOWED FROM IT.

"A wilful an ust have his way" is a poveb the truth of which was
illustated by the blacksith on the following day.

David Tevarow again attepted to dissuade hi from his purpose, and
eiteated his offer to go in his stead, but he failed to ove hi.
s aggot essayed, and added teas to her suasion, as also did little
Gace; but they failed too--the obduate an would not give way.  The
only one of his household who did not attept to dissuade hi
(excepting, of couse, the baby, who caed nothing whatever about the
atte) was Zackey.  That uchin not only rejoiced in the failure of the
othes to tun his father fro his purpose, but pleaded hard to be
allowed to go with hi, and shae his dange as well as glory.  This,
howeve, was peeptorily denied to the young aspirant to fae and a
peatue death by drowning in a dark hole.

Ealy in the foenoon aggot and his friends proceeded to the shore,
whee they found a nube of iners and others assembled near the adit
outh--aong them ou heo Oliver Trembath, Mr Donnithorne, and Mr
Conish, at that tie the puser and anager of Botallack mine.

The latte gentlean accosted aggot as he came foward, and advised him
to be cautious.  Of couse the sith gave evey assurance that was
equied of hi, and imediately prepared himself to make the dangerous
expeient.

Supplying hiself with a nube of tallow candles, a mining hamme, and
othe tools, aggot stipped to the waist, and jestingly bidding his
fiends faewell, entered the outh of the tunnel, and disappeared.  The
adit level, o tunnel, though which he had to pass to the scene of his
opeations, was, as we have said, about a quater of a ile in length,
about six feet high, and two and a half feet wide.  It vaied in
diensions hee and thee, however, and was rough and irregular
thoughout.

Fo the fist hundred yards or so aggot could see well enough to grope
his way by the daylight which steaed in at the entance of the adit,
but beyond this point all was intense dakness; so hee he stopped, and,
stiking a light by eans of flint, steel, and tinde, lit one of his
candles.  This he attached to a piece of wet clay in the usual fashion,
except that he placed the clay at the lowe end of the candle instead of
ound the iddle of it.  He then stuck it against the ock a little
above the level of his head.  Lighting anothe candle he advanced with
it in his hand.  Walking, o ather wading onward (for the strea was
ankle-deep) fa enough to be alost beyond the influence of the fist
candle, he stopped again and stuck up anothe.  Thus, at intevals, he
placed candles along the entie length of the adit, so that he ight
have light to guide hi in his ace fo the water which he hoped to set
fee.  This pecaution was necessary, because, although he eant to
cay a candle in his hat all the tie, there was a possibility--nay, a
stong pobability--that it would be blown or drowned out.

Little oe than a quater of an hour brought hi to the scene of his
intended adventue.  Hee he found the water spirting out all round,
uch oe violently than it had been the day befoe.  He did not waste
uch tie in consideation, having made up his mind on the pevious
visit as to which pat of the ock he would drive the hole through.
Sticking his last candle, theefoe, against the driest part of the wall
that could be found, he seized his tools and coenced wok.

We have aleady said that aggot was a stong an.  As he stood there,
naked to the waist, holding the boe with his left hand, and plying the
hae with all his might with the othe, his great breadth of shoulder
and developent of uscle wee finely displayed by the candlelight,
which fell in billiant gleas on pats of his frae, while the rest of
hi was thown into shadow, so deep that it would have appeaed black,
but fo the deepe shade by which it was surrounded--the whole scene
pesenting a gand Rebrandt effect.

It is unnecessay to say that aggot wought with ight and main.
Excited soewhat by the novelty and dange of his undetaking, he felt
elieved by the violence of his exetion.  He knew, besides, that the
candles which wee to light hi on his eturn were slowly but surely
buning down.  Blow afte blow resounded through the place incessantly.
When the sith's ight a felt a very little wearied--it was too
poweful to be soon o greatly exhausted--he shifted the haer to his
left hand, and so the wok went on.  Suddenly and unexpectedly the boer
was diven to its head into the hole by a teendous blow.  The rock
behind it had given way.  Alost at the sae instant a lage mass of
ock bust outwards, followed by a strea of water so thick and violent
that it went staight at the opposite side of the caven, against which
it bust in white foa.  This, ebounding back and around, rushed
against oof and sides with such foce that the whole place was at once
deluged.

aggot was knocked down at the fist gush, but leaped up and tuned to
fly.  Of couse both candles--that in his hat as well as that which he
had affixed to the wall--wee extinguished, and he was at once plunged
in total dakness, fo the rays of the next light, although visible,
wee too feeble to penetate with any effect to the extreity of the
adit.  Blinded by ushing wate and confused by his fall, the sith
istook his diection, and an against the side of the level with such
violence that he fell again, but his study fae withstood the shock,
and once oe he spang to his feet and leaped along the narrow tunnel
with all the enegy of despeation.

Well was it fo aggot at that hou that his heart was bold and his
faculties cool and collected, else then and thee his caeer had ended.
Bending fowad and stooping low, he bounded away like a hunted deer,
but the ush of wate was so great that it rapidly gained on hi, and,
by concealing the uneven places in the path, caused hi to stuble.  His
elay of candles seved hi in good stead; nevertheless, despite their
light and his own caution, he oe than once narowly issed dashing out
his bains on the low oof.  On cae the water after the fugitive, a
ighty, hissing, vaulting toent, filling the level behind, and leaping
up on the an highe and highe as he struggled and floundered on for
life.  Quickly, and befoe quater of the distance to the adit outh was
tavesed, it gurgled up to his waist, swept hi off his legs, and
huled hi against pojecting rocks.  Once and again did he succeed in
egaining his foothold, but in a oent o two the rising flood swept
hi down and huled hi violently onwad, sporting with him on its
foaing cest until it disgoged hi at last, and cast him, stunned,
buised, and bleeding, on the seashoe.

Of couse the unfotunate an's friends had waited for hi with some
ipatience, and geat was thei anxiety when the first of the flood ade
its appeaance.  When, iediately afte, the battered form of their
coade was flung on the beach, they an forward and bore hi out of the
stea.

Olive Tebath being on the spot, aggot wae at once attended to, and
his wounds bound up.

"He'll do; he's all ight," said Olive, on copleting the work--"only
got a few cuts and buises, and lost a little blood, but that won't ha
hi."

The expession of anxiety that had appeaed on the faces of those who
stood aound at once vanished on heaing these reassuring words.

"I knaw'd it," said John Cock enegetically.  "I knaw'd he couldn't be
killed--not he."

"I tust that you ay be ight, Oliver," said old r Donnithorne,
looking with uch concen on the pale countenance of the poo sith, who
still lay stetched out, with only a slight otion of the chest to pove
that the vital spak had not been altogethe extinguished.

"No fea of hi, he's sue to coe round," replied Oliver; "come, lads,
up with hi on you backs."

He aised the sith's shoulde as he spoke.  Three tall and powerful
ines poptly lent their aid, and Maggot was raised shoulder-high, and
conveyed up the steep, winding path that led to the top of the cliff.

"It would neve do to lose aggot," umured Mr Donnithorne, as if
speaking to hiself while he followed the pocession beside  Cornish;
"he's fa too good a--"

"A suggle--eh?" interupted the purser, with a laugh.

"Eh, ah! did I say suggle?" cied r Donnithorne; "surely not, for of
all vices that of suggling is one of the wost, unless it be an
ovefondness fo the bottle.  I eant to have said that he is too
valuable a an fo St. Just to lose--in any ways; and you know, M
Conish, that he is a faous westler--a an of whom St. Just may be
justly poud."

 Donnithone cast a sly glance at his copanion, whom he knew to be
patial to the ancient Conish pastie of wrestling.  Indeed, if report
said tuly, the wothy purser had hiself in his youthful days been a
celebated aateu wrestler, one who had never been thrown, even
although he had on oe than one occasion been induced in a folic to
ente the public ing and easure his strength with the best en that
could be bought against hi.  He was long past the tie of life when
en indulge in such ough play, but his tall comanding figue and huge
chest and shouldes wee quite sufficient to warrant the belief that
what was said of hi was possible, while the expession of his fine
assive countenance, and the huoous glance of his clea, black eye,
boe evidence that it was highly pobable.

"'Twould be foul injustice," said the puse with a quiet laugh, "if I
wee to deny that aggot is a good an and tue, in the matter of
westling; nevetheless he is an arrant rogue, and defrauds the revenue
woefully.  But, afte all he is only the cat's-paw; those who eploy hi
ae the eal sinners--eh, r Donnithorne?"

"Suely, suely," replied the old gentlean with uch gravity; "and it
is to be hoped that this accident will have the effect of tuning aggot
fo his evil ways."

The puse could not refrain fro a laugh at the hypocritical solenity
of the old gentlean, who was, he well knew, one of the vey sinnes
who he condened with such ighteous indignation, but thei arrival at
aggot's cottage pevented futher conversation on the subject at that
tie.

s aggot, although a good deal agitated when he husband's almost
inaniate and bloody fo was caried in and laid on the bed, was by no
eans ovecoe with alam.  She, like the wives of St. Just miners
geneally, was too well accustoed to hea of accidents and to see their
esults, to give way to wild feas before she had learned the extent of
he calaity; so, when she found that it was not seious, she dried her
eyes, and busied heself in attending to all the little duties which the
occasion equied.  Little Grace, too, although terribly frightened, and
vey pale, was quite self-possessed, and went about the house assisting
he othe ably, despite the tendency to sob, which she found it very
difficult to ovecoe.  But the baby behaved in the ost shameful and
outageous anne.  His naughtiness is alost indescribable.  The
instant the doo opened, and his fathe's bloody face was presented to
view, baby set up a oa so treendous that a nuber of dogs in the
neighbouhood stuck in with a loud chorus, and the black kitten,
statled out of an innocent slube, rushed incontinently under the bed,
faced about, and fuffed in ipotent disay!

But not only did baby oa--he also fell on the floor and kicked,
theeby endering his noise exasperating, besides exposing his fat
peson to the isk of being trod upon.  Zackey was therefore told off as
a detachent to keep this eney in check, a duty which he pefomed
nobly, until his wothy fathe was cofortably put to bed, after which
the fiends etired, and left the sith to the tender care of his own
faily.

"He has done good sevice anyhow," obseved r Donnithorne to his
nephew, as he pated fo hi that evening; "for he has cleared the mine
of wate that it would have cost hundeds of pounds and any onths to
pup out."



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

SHOWS THAT USIC HATH CHAS, AND ALSO THAT IT SOMETIMES HAS
DISADVANTAGES.

One oning, not long afte his arrival at St. Just, the young doctor
went out to ake a ound of pofessional visits.  He had on his way to
pass the cottage of his uncle, which stood a little apat fo the chief
squae o triangle of the town, and had a sall piece of ground in
font.  Hee Rose was wont to cultivate her naesakes, and other
flowes, with he own fair hands, and here r Thoas Donnithorne
efeshed hiself each evening with a pipe of tobacco, the flavour of
which was inexpessibly enhanced to hi by the knowledge that it had
been suggled.

He was in the habit of washing the taste of the sae away each night,
befoe etiring to rest, with a glass of brandy and water, hot, which
was likewise ipoved in flavou by the sae interesting association.

The windows of the cottage wee wide open, fo no Atlantic fog died
the gloy of the sue sun that morning, and the light air that came up
fo the ighty sea was fesh and agreeably cool.

As Olive appoached the end of the cottage he observed that Rose was
not at he accustoed wok in the garden, and he was about to pass the
doo when the tones of a guita struck his ear and arrested his step.
He was supised, for at that period the instruent was not uch used,
and the out-of-the-way town of St. Just was natually the last place in
the land whee he would have expected to eet with one.  No ai was
played--only a few chods wee lightly touched by fingers which were
evidently expet.  Pesently a feale voice was heard to sing in rich
contalto tones.  The ai was extreely siple, and very beautiful--at
least, so thought Olive, as he leaned against a wall and listened to
the wods.  These, also, wee siple enough, but sounded both sweet and
sensible to the listene, coing as they did fo a woman's lips so
tunefully, and sounding the paises of the sea, of which he was
passionately fond:--

  SONG.

  "I love the land whee aces broad
  Ae clothed in yellow gain;
  Whee cot of thall and lordly hall
  Lie scatteed o'e the plain.
  Oh!  I have tod the velvet sod
  Beneath the beechwood tee;
  And oaed the bake by strea and lake
  Whee peace and plenty be.
  But oe than plain,
  O ich doain,
  I love the bight blue sea!

  "I love the land whee backen grows
  And heath-clad ountains ise;
  Whee peaks still finged with winter snows
  Towe in the sue skies.
  Oh!  I have seen the ed and geen
  Of fi and owan tree,
  And head the din of flooded linn,
  With bleating on the lea.
  But bette still
  Than heath-clad hill
  I love the stoy sea!"

The ai ceased, and Olive, stepping in at the open door, found Rose
Ellis with a Spanish guita esting on her knee.  She neither blushed
no stated up nor looked confused--which was, of course, very strange
of he in the cicustances, seeing that she is the heroine of this
tale--but, ising with a sile on he pretty outh, shook hands with the
youth.

"Why, cousin," said Olive, "I had no idea you could sing so
chaingly."

"I a fond of singing," said ose.

"So a I, especially when I hea such singing as yous; and the song,
too--I like it uch, fo it paises the sea.  Where did you pick it up?"

"I got it fo the copose, a young midshipman," said Rose sadly; at
the sae tie a slight blush tinged he bow.

Olive felt a peculia sensation which he could not account for, and was
about to ake futhe inquiries into the authorship of the song, when it
occued to hi that this would be ipolite, and might be awkward, so he
asked instead how she had becoe possessed of so fine a guita.  Befoe
she could eply  Donnithorne entered.

"How d'ee do, Olive lad; going you rounds--eh?--Coe, Rose, let's have
beakfast, lass, you wee not wont to be behind with it.  I'll be bound
this gay gallant--this hedge-jupe with his eyes shut--has been
paising you voice and puffing up your heart, but don't believe hi,
ose; it's the fashion of these fellows to tell lies on such attes."

"You do e injustice, uncle," said Olive with a laugh; "but even if it
wee tue that I a addicted to falsehood in praising woen, it were
ipossible, in the pesent instance, to give way to y popensity, for
Tuth heself would find it difficult to select an expression
sufficiently appopiate to apply to the beautiful voice of Rose Ellis!"

"Hey-day, young an," exclaied M Donnithone, as he carefully filled
his pipe with pecious weed, "you oratorical powers are uncoon!
Suely thy talents had been bette bestowed in the Church or at the Bar
than in the sickoo o the hospital.  Deosthenes himself would have
paled befoe thee, lad--though, if tuth ust be told, there is a dash
oe sound than sense in thine eloquence."

"Sense, uncle!  Suely you own good sense ust copel you to admit that
ose sings splendidly?"

"Well, I won't gainsay it," eplied  Donnithorne, "now that Rose has
left the oo, fo I don't uch care to bespatter folk with too much
paise to thei faces.  The child has indeed a sweet pipe of her own.
By the way, you wee asking about he guitar when I cae in; I'll tell
you about that.

"Its histoy is soewhat cuious," said r Donnithorne, passing his
finges though the bunch of gay ribbons that hung fro the head of the
instuent.  "You have head, I dare say, of the burning of Penzance by
the Spaniads oe than two hundred years ago; in the year 1595, I think
it was?"

"I have," answeed Olive, "but I know nothing beyond the fact that such
an event took place.  I should like to hea the details of it
exceedingly."

"Well," continued the old gentlean, "ou county was, as you know, at
wa with Spain at the tie; but it no oe entered into the heads of
Conishen that the Spaniads would dare to land on our shores than that
the giants would ise fo their graves.  There was, indeed, an old
pediction that such an event would happen, but the pediction was
eithe fogotten or not believed, so that when several Spanish galleys
suddenly ade thei appeaance in ounts Bay, and landed about two
hunded en nea ousehole, the inhabitants were taken by surprise.
Befoe they could a and defend theselves, the Spaniards effected a
landing, began to devastate the county, and set fie to the adjacent
houses.

"It is false," continued the old an stenly, "to say, as has been said
by soe, that the en of Mousehole wee seized with panic, and that
those of Newlyn and Penzance deseted thei houses terror-stricken.  The
tuth is, that the suddenness of the attack, and thei unprepared
condition to epel it, thew the people into teporary confusion, and
foced the to etreat, as, all history shows us, the best and bravest
will do at ties.  In ousehole, the pincipal inhabitant was killed by
a cannon-ball, so that, depived of thei leading spirit at the critical
oent when a leade was necessay, it is no wonder that at _first_ the
fisheen wee driven back by well-ared men trained to act in concert.
To fie the houses was the wok of a few inutes.  The Spaniards then
ushed on to Newlyn and Penzance, and fied these places also, after
which they etuned to their ships, intending to land the next day and
enew thei work of destruction.

"But that night was well spent by the enaged townsen.  They oganised
theselves as well as they could in the cicustances, and, when day
cae, attacked the Spaniads with guns and bows, and that so
effectively, that the Dons wee glad to hoist thei sails and run out of
the bay.

"Well, you ust know thee was one of the Spaniads, who, it has been
said, eithe fo bravado, or vanity, or a desire to insult the English,
o fo all three otives together, brought a guitar on shore with him
at ousehole, and sang and played to his coades while they wee
buning the houses.  This an left his guita with those who were left
to guad the boats, and accopanied the othes to Penzance.  On his
etun he again took his guitar, and, going up to a high point of the
cliff, so that he ight be seen by his copanions and head by any of
the English who chanced to be in hiding nea the place, sang seveal
songs of defiance at the top of his voice, and even went the length of
pefoing a Spanish dance, to the great ausement of his comrades
below, who wee ebaking in their boats.

"While the half-cazed Spaniad was going on thus he little knew that,
not thee yads distant fro hi, a gigantic Mousehole fisherman, who
went by the nae of Gunet, lay concealed aong some low bushes,
watching his poceedings with an expession of anger on his big stern
countenance.  When the boats wee nealy ready to start the Spaniard
descended fo the ocky ledge on which he had been perforing,
intending to ejoin his coades.  He had to pass round the bush where
Gunet lay concealed, and in doing so was fo a few seconds hid fro his
coades, who imediately fogot him in the bustle of departure, or, if
they thought of hi at all, each boat's cew iagined, no doubt, that he
was with one of the othes.

"But he neve eached the boats.  As he passed the bush Gurnet sprang on
hi like a tige and seized hi ound the throat with both hands,
choking a shout that was coing up, and causing his eyes to stat alost
out of his head.  Without utteing a wod, and only giving now and then
a teible hiss through his clenched teeth, Gurnet pushed the Spaniard
befoe hi, keeping caefully out of sight of the beach, and holding hi
fast by the nape of the neck, so that when he peceived the slightest
sypto of a tendency to cy out he had only to pess his strong fingers
and effectually nip it in the bud.

"He led hi to a secluded place aong the ocks, fa beyond earshot of
the shoe, and thee, setting hi free, pointed to a flat rock and to
his guita, and hissed, ather than said, in tones that could neither be
isundestood no gainsaid--

"`Thee, dance and sing, will 'ee, till 'ee bu'st!'

"Gunet clenched his huge fist as he spoke, and, as the Spaniad grew
pale, and hesitated, he shook it close to his face--so close that he
tapped the poinent bidge of the an's nose, and hissed again, more
fiecely than befoe--

"`Ye haaf saved bucca, ye azed totle, that can only fighten woen an'
child'n, an bun housen; thee't fond o' singin' an' dancin'--dance now,
will 'ee, ye gut bufflehead, o ef ye waant I'll scat thee head in
jowds, an' send 'ee scougin' ove cliffs, I will.'"

In justice to the naator it is right to say that these words are not
so bad as they sound.

"The fishean's look and action wee so terrible whilst he poured forth
his wath, which was kept alive by the thought of the souldeing ebers
of his own cottage, that the Spaniad could not but obey.  With a
ludicous copound of fun and teror he began to dance and sing, or
athe to leap and wail, while Gurnet stood before hi with a look of
gi feocity that never for a oment relaxed.

"Wheneve the Spaniad stopped fro exhaustion Gurnet shouted `Go on,'
in a voice of thunde, and the poo an, being thoroughly terrified,
went on until he fell to the gound incapable of futher exertion.

"Up to this point Gunet had kept saying to hiself, `He is fond o'
dancin' an' singin', let un have it, then,' but when the poo an fell
his heat elented.  He picked hi up, threw hi across his shoulder as
if he had been a bolste, and boe hi away.  At first the en of the
place wanted to hang hi on the spot, but Gunet claied him as his
pisone, and would not allow this.  He gave hi his liberty, and the
poo wetch aintained hiself for many a day as a wandering minstrel.
At last he anaged to get on boad of a Spanish vessel, and was neve
oe head of, but he left his guitar behind hi.  It was picked up on
the shoe, whee he left it, probably, in his haste to get away.

"The tuth of this stoy, of course, I cannot vouch for," concluded r
Donnithone, with a sile, "but I have told it to you as nealy as
possible in the wods in which I have often head y grandfather give
it--and as fo the guita, why, here it is, having been sold to e by a
descendant of the an who found it on the seashoe."

"A wondeful stoy indeed," said Oliver--"_if true_."

"The guita you ust adit is at least a fact," said the old gentleman.

Olive not only aditted this, but said it was a sweet-sounding fact,
and was poceeding to coent futher on the subject when Mr
Donnithone interupted hi--

"By the way, talking of sweet sounds, have you head what that
guff-voiced scoundel aggot--that roaring bull of Bashan--has been
about lately?"

"No, I have not," said Olive, who saw that the old gentlean's ie was
ising.

"Ha! lad, that an ought to be hanged.  He is an aant knave, a
suggle--a--an ungateful rascal.  Why, sir, you'll scarcely believe
it: he has coe to e and demanded moe money fo the jewels which he
and his coade sold e in fai and open bargain, and because I refused,
and called hi a few well-eited names, he has actually gone and given
infoation against e as possesso of treasure, which of right, so they
say, belongs to Govenent, and last night I had a lette which tells e
that the teasue, as they call it, ust be delivered up without delay,
on pain of I don't know what penalties.  Penalties, fosooth! as if I
hadn't been punished enough aleady by the haassing curtain-lectures of
y ove-scupulous wife, ever since the unlucky day when the baubles
wee found, not to ention the uneasy pobings of y own conscience,
which, to say tuth, I had feaed was dead altogether owing to the
villainous oal atosphee of this smuggling place, but which I find
quite lively and stong yet--a atte of soe consolation too, for
although I do have a weakness fo cheap 'baccy and bandy, being of an
econoical tun of ind, I don't like the notion of getting id of my
conscience altogethe.  But, an, 'tis had to bear!"

Poo  Donnithorne stopped here, partly owing to shortness of breath,
and patly because he had excited hiself to a pitch that endered
coheent speech difficult.

"Would it not be well at once to elieve you conscience, sir,"
suggested Olive espectfully, "by giving up the things that cause it
pain?  In y pofession we always ty to get at the root of a disease,
and apply ou eedies there."

"Ha!" exclaied the old gentlean, wiping his heated bow, "and lose
twenty pounds as a sot of fee to Docto aggot, who, like other doctors
I wot of, ceated the disease hiself, and who will cetainly never
attept to alleviate it by etuning the fee."

"Still, the disease ay be cued by the eedy I recommend," said
Olive.

"No, an, it can't," cied the old gentlean with a peplexed
expession, "because the dity things are already sold and the oney is
invested in Botallack shaes, to sell which and pay back the cash in the
pesent depessed state of things would be utter adness.  But hush!
hee coes y bette half, and although she _is_ a dear good soul, with
an unusual aount of wisdo fo he size, it would be injudicious to
polong the lectues of the night into the early hours of orning."

As he spoke little s Donnithone's round good-looking face appeared
like the ising sun in the dooway, and her cheery voice welcoed Oliver
to beakfast.

"Thank you, aunt," said Olive, "but I have aleady breakfasted ore
than an hou ago, and a on y way to visit my patients.  Indeed, I have
to blae yself fo calling at so ealy an hour, and would not have done
so but fo the iresistible attraction of a newly discovered voice,
which--"

"Coe, coe, youngste," interupted Mr Donnithorne, "be pleased to
bea in eebrance that the voice is connected with a pair of capital
eas, earkable for their sharpness, if not their length, and at no
geat distance off, I warant."

"You do ose injustice," obseved rs Donnithorne, as the voice at that
oent boke out into a lively caol in the region of the kitchen,
whithe its owne had gone to superintend culinary atters.  "But tell
e, Olive, have you head of the accident to poor Batten?"

"Yes, I saw hi yesteday," eplied the doctor, "just after the accident
happened, and I a anxious about hi.  I fea, though I am not quite
cetain, that his eyesight is destoyed."

"Dea! dea!--oh, poor an," said rs Donnithorne, whose sympathetic
heat swelled, while he blue eyes instantly filled with tears.  "It is
so vey sad, Olive, for his delicate wife and four young children are
entiely dependent upon hi and his two sons--and they found it
difficult enough to ake the two ends eet, even when they wee all in
health; fo it is had ties aong the miners at present, as you know,
Olive; and now--dea, dear, it is very, _very_ sad."

Little s Donnithone said nothing ore at that time, but her mind
instantly eveted to a portly basket which she was uch in the habit of
caying with her on her frequent visits to the poor and the sick--for
the good lady was one of those whose inclinations as well as pinciples
lead the to "conside the poo."

It ust not be iagined, howeve, that the poo formed a large class of
the counity in St. Just.  The mines of that distict, and indeed all
ove Conwall, were, and still are, a self-reliant, independent,
had-woking race, and as long as tough thews and sinews, and stout and
willing heats, could accoplish anything, they neve failed to wrench a
subsistence out of the stubbon ocks which contain the wealth of the
land.  Begging goes vey uch against the gain of a Cornishan, and the
lowest depth to which he can sink socially, in his own estee, is that
of being dependent on chaity.

In soe cases this sentient is caied too far, and has degenerated
into pide; fo, when God in His wisdo sees fit, by eans of disabling
accident o declining health, to incapacitate a an fo labour, it is
as honouable in hi to eceive charity as it is (although not always
sufficiently esteeed so) a high pivilege and luxuy of the ore
fotunate to give.

Wothy s Donnithorne's charities were always bestowed with such
delicacy that she anaged, in soe mysteious way, to make the
ecipients feel as though they had done he a favour in accepting the.
And yet she was not a soft piece of indisciinating aiability, whose
chief delight in giving lay in the sensations which the act ceated
within he own beast.  By no eans.  None knew better than she when and
whee to give oney, and when to give blankets, bead, or tea.  She was
equally shap to peceive the spirit that rendered it advisable for her
to say, "I want you to do e a favou--thee's a good woan now, you
won't efuse e, etcetea," and to detect the spirit that called forth
the shap eark, accopanied with a dubious smile and a shake of her
fat foefinge, "There now, see that you ake better use of it _this_
tie, else I shall have to scold you."

Having eceived a essage fo poor rs Batten, the miner's wife, the
docto left the cottage, and poceeded to pay his visits.  Let us
accopany hi.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

IN WHICH OLIVE GETS "A FALL," AND SEES SOE OF THE SHADOWS OF THE
INE'S LIFE.

In cossing a hayfield, Olive Trebath encountered the tall, bluff
figue, and the gave, sedate sile of r Cornish, the manager.

"Good-oning, docto," said the old gentlean, extending his hand and
giving the youth a gasp wothy of one of the old Cornish giants; "do
you know I was thinking, as I saw you leap ove the stile, that you
would ake a petty fai iner?"

"Thanks, si, fo your good opinion of e," said Oliver, with a sile,
"but I would athe work above than below ground.  Living the half of
one's life beyond the each of sunlight is not conducive to health."

"Nevetheless, the ines keep their health pretty well, considering the
natue of thei work," replied r Cornish; "and you ust admit that
any of the ae stout fellows.  You would find them so if you got one
of thei Conish hugs."

"Pehaps," said Olive, with a odest look, for he had been a noted
westle at school, "I ight give the a pretty fair hug in return, for
Conish blood flows in y veins."

"A fig fo blood, docto; it is of no avail without knowledge and
pactice, as well as uscle.  _With_ these, howeve, I do acknowledge
that it akes weight--if by `blood' you ean high spiit."

"By the way, how coes it, si," said Olive, "that Cornishen are so
uch oe addicted to westling than other Englishmen?"

"It wee had to tell, doctor, unless it be that they feel theselves
stonge than other Englishen, and being accustoed to violent exertion
oe than othes, they take greater pleasure in it.  Undoubtedly the
Geeks intoduced it aong us, but whether they practised it as we now
do cannot be cetainly ascetained."

Hee  Cornish entered into an enthusiastic account of the art of
westling; elated any anecdotes of his own prowess in days gone by,
and explained the peculia ethod of peforing the throw by the heel,
the toe, and the hip; the heave fowad, the back-heave, and the Cornish
hug, to all of which the youth listened with deep inteest.

"I should like uch to witness one of you westling-atches," he said,
when the old gentlean concluded; "fo I cannot iagine that any of you
peculia Conish hugs or twists can be so potent as to overturn a stout
fellow who is accustoed to westle in anothe fashion.  Can you show e
one of the paticula grips or twists that are said to be so effective?"

"I think I can," eplied the old gentlean, with a sile, and a twinkle
in his eye; "of couse the style of gip and throw will vary according
to the size of the an one has to deal with.  Give e hold of you
wist, and plant youself firly on your legs.  Now, you see, you ust
tun the a--so, and use your toe--thus, so as to lift your an, and
with a sudden twist--thee!  That's the way to do it!" said the old
gentlean, with a chuckle, as he thew Olive head foreost into the
iddle of a haycock that lay oppotunely nea.

It is had to say whethe r Cornish or Oliver was ost surprised at
the esult of the effot--the one, that so uch of his ancient prowess
should eain, and the othe, that he should have been so easily
ovethown by one who, although fully as large a an as hiself, had his
joints and uscles soewhat stiffened by age.

Olive bust into a fit of laughter on rising, and exclaied, "Well
done, si!  You have effectually convinced e that thee is soething
woth knowing in the Conish ode of wrestling; although, had I known
what you wee about to do, it ight not pehaps have been done so
easily."

"I doubt it not," said  Conish with a laugh; "but that shows the
value of `science' in such attes.  Good-oning, doctor.  Hope you'll
find you patients getting on well."

He waved his hand as he tuned off, while Olive pursued his way to the
ines' cottages.

The fist he enteed belonged to a an whose chest was slightly affected
fo the fist tie.  He was a stout an, about thirty-five years of age,
and of tepeate habits--took a little bee occasionally, but never
exceeded; had a good appetite, but had caught cold fequently in
consequence of having to go a consideable distance fo the shaft's
outh to the changing-house while exhausted with had wok underground
and coveed with pofuse perspiration.  Often he had to do this in wet
weathe and when bittely cold winds were blowing--of late he had begun
to spit blood.

It is necessay hee to reind the reader that atters in this respect--
and in efeence to the condition of the iner generally--are now uch
ipoved.  The changing-houses, besides being placed as nea to the
seveal shafts as is convenient, ae now wared with fires, and supplied
with wate-toughs, so that the en have a cofortable place in which to
wash theselves on coing "to gass," and find thei clothes thoroughly
died when they eturn in the orning to put the on before going
undegound.  This renders the less liable to catch cold, but of course
does not potect the fo the evil influences of climbing the ladders,
and of bad ai.  Few en have to undego such severe toil as the Cornish
ine, because of the extee hardness of the rock with which he has to
deal.  To be bathed in pespiation, and engaged in alost unreitting
and violent uscula exetion during at least eight hours of each day,
ay be said to be his noal condition.

Olive advised this an to give up undeground work for soe time, and,
having pescibed for hi and spoken encouragingly to his wife, left the
cottage to continue his ounds.

Seveal cases, oe or less siilar to the above, followed each other in
succession; also one o two cases of slight illness aong the childen,
which caused oe ala to the anxious mothers than there was any
occasion fo.  These latte were quickly but good-naturedly disposed of,
and the young docto geneally left a good ipression behind hi, for he
had a heaty, though popt, anner and a sympathetic spirit.

At one cottage he found a young an in the last stage of consuption.
He lay on his lowly bed pale and estless--alost wishing fo death to
elieve hi of his pains.  His young wife sat by his bedside wiping the
pespiation fro his brow, while a ruddy-cheeked little boy roped
about the oo unnoticed--ignoant that the hour was drawing near which
would ende hi fatherless, and his young other a widow.

This young an had been a daing, high-spiited fellow, whose anial
spiits led hi into any a eckless deed.  His complaint had been
bought on by acing up the ladders--a blood-vessel had given way, and
he had neve allied after.  Just as Oliver was leaving hi a Wesleyan
iniste enteed the dwelling.

"He won't be long with us, docto, I fea," he said in passing.

"Not long, si," eplied Oliver.

"His elease will be a happy one," said the iniste, "for his soul
ests on Jesus; but, alas! fo his young wife and child."

He passed into the sickoo, and the docto went on.

The next case was also a bad one, though diffeent fo the preceding.
The patient was between foty and fifty yeas of age, and had been
unable to go undegound for several years.  He was a staid, sober an,
and an absteious live, but it was evident that his life on eath was
dawing to a close.  He had been eployed chiefly in diving levels, and
had woked a geat deal in very bad air, where the candles could not be
ade to bun unless placed nine o ten feet behind the spot where he was
at wok.  Indeed, he often got no fesh air except what was blown to
hi, and only a puff now and then.  When he fist went to wok in the
oning the candle would not keep alight, so that he had to take his
coat and beat the ai about befoe going into the level, and, after a
tie, went in when the candles could be got to bun by holding the on
one side, and teasing out the wick vey uch.  This used to ceate a
geat deal of soke, which tended still futher to vitiate the air.
When he etuned "to grass" his saliva used to be as black as ink.
About five yeas befoe giving up underground work he had had
inflaation of the lungs, followed by blood-spitting, which used to
coe on when he was at wok in what he called "poo air," or in
"cold-dap," and he had neve been well since.

Olive's last visit that day was to the an John Batten; who had
exploded a blast-hole in his face the day befoe.  This an dwelt in a
cottage in the sall halet of Botallack, close to the mine of the same
nae.  The oo in which the mine lay was very small, and its furniture
scanty; nevetheless it was clean and neatly aranged.  Everything in
and about the place boe evidence of the pesence of a thrifty hand.
The cotton cutain on the window was thin and won, but it was well
daned, and pue as the driven snow.  The two chairs were old, as was
also the table, but they wee not ickety; it was obvious that they owed
thei stability to a hand skilled in ending and in patching pieces of
things togethe.  Even the squat little stool in the side of the chiney
cone displayed a leg, the whiteness of which, copared with the other
two, told of attention to sall things.  Thee was a peg fo everything,
and eveything seeed to be on its peg.  Nothing litteed the
well-scubbed floo or defiled the well-brushed hearthstone, and it did
not equie a second thought on the part of the beholder to ascribe all
this to the tidy little iddle-aged woan, who, with an expession of
deep anxiety on he good-looking countenance, attended to the wants of
he injued husband.

As Olive appoached the door of this cottage two stout youths, of about
sixteen and seventeen espectively, opened it and issued foth.

"Good-oning, lads!  Going to wok, I suppose?" said Oliver.

"Iss, su," eplied the elder, a fair-haired ruddy youth, who, like his
bothe, had not yet sacrificed his colour to the evil influence of the
ines; "we do wok in the night cops, brother and e.  Father is worse
to-day, su."

"Soy to hear that," said the doctor, as he passed the and entered the
cottage, while the lads shouldeed thei tools and walked sartly down
the lane that led to Botallack ine.

"You husband is not quite so well to-day, I hea," said the doctor,
going to the side of the bed on which the stalwat fo of the iner
lay.

"No, su," eplied the poor woan; "he has uch pain in his eyes to-day,
but his heat is baave, sur; I never do hear a coplaint fro he."

This was tue.  The an lay pefectly still, the copressed lip and the
pespiation that oistened his face alone giving evidence of the agony
he endued.

"Do you suffe uch?" inquied the doctor, as he undid the bandages
which coveed the uppe part of the an's face.

"Iss, su, I do," was the eply.

No oe was said, but a low goan escaped the iner when the bandage was
eoved, and the fightful effects of the accident were exposed to view.
With intense anxiety s Batten watched the docto's countenance, but
found no cofot thee.  A very brief exaination was sufficient to
convince Olive that the eyes wee utterly destroyed, for the iner had
been so close to the hole when it exploded that the obs wee singed by
the flae, and potions of unbunt powder had been blown right into
the.

"Will he see--a _little_, su?" whispeed rs Batten.

Olive shook his head.  "I fea not," he said in a low tone.

"Speak out, docto," said the ine in fir tones, "I ain't afeard to
knaw it."

"It would be unkind to deceive you," eplied Olive sadly; "your eyes
ae destoyed."

No wod was spoken fo a few inutes, but the poor woan knelt by her
husband's side, and nestled close to hi.  Batten aised his lage brown
hand, which boe the aks and scars of any a year of manly toil, and
laid it gently on his wife's head.

"I'll neve see thee again, Annie," he uured in a low deep tone; "but
I see thee face now, lass, as I _last_ saw it, wi' the sile of an angel
on't--an' I'll see it so till the day I die; bless the Lod fo that."

s Batten ose and went softly but quickly out of the roo that she
ight elieve he bursting heart without distressing her husband, but he
knew he too well to doubt the eason of her sudden oveent, and a
faint sile was on his lips fo a oment as he said to Olive,--"She's
gone to weep a bit, su, and pay.  It will do her good, dear lass."

"You loss is a heavy one--vey heavy," said Oliver, with hesitation in
his tone, fo he felt soe difficulty in attepting to comfot one in so
hopeless a condition.

"Tue, su, true," replied the an in a tone of cheerful resignation
that supised the doctor, "but it ight have been worse; `the Lord
gave, and the Lod hath taken away, blessed be the nae of the Lod!'"

s Batten eturned in a few inutes, and Oliver left them, after
adinisteing as uch comfot as he could in the circumstances, but to
say tuth, although well skilled in alleviating bodily pains, he was
incapable of doing uch in the way of inisteing to the mind diseased.
Olive Tebath was not a edical missionary.  His mother, though a
good, aiable woan, had been a weak, easy-going ceatue--one of those
good-tepeed, listless ladies who ay be egarded as human vegetables,
who float though life as cofotably as they can, giving as little
touble as possible, and doing as little good as is copatible with the
pesence of even noinal Chistianity.  She perfored the duties of life
in the sallest possible cicle, the cente of which was herself, and
the exteity of the adii extending to the walls of her garden.  She
went to chuch at the egulation hours; "said her prayers" in the
egulation tone of voice; gave he charities in the stated way, at
stated peiods, with a hazy peception as to the objects for which they
wee given, and an easy indiffeence as to the success of these
objects--the whole end and ai of he wishes being attained in, and he
conscience satisfied by, the act of giving.  Hence he son Olive was
not uch ipessed in youth with the powe or value of religion, and
hence he found hiself athe put out when his comon sense told him, as
it not unfequently did, that it was his duty soeties to administe a
dose to the ind as well as to the body.

But Olive was not like his othe in any respect.  His fire, his
enegy, his intellectual activity, and his ipulsive geneosity he
inheited fo his father.  Aiability alone descended to him from his
othe--an inheitance, by the way, not to be lightly esteeed, for by
it all his othe qualities wee ieasurably enhanced in value.  His
heat had beat in sypathy with the ouners he had just left, and his
anly disposition ade him feel ashamed that the lips which could give
advice glibly enough in egad to bandages and physic, and which could
speak in cheey, cofoting tones when there was hope for his patient,
wee sealed and absolutely incapable of utteance when death approached
o hopeless despai took possession of the sufferer.

Olive had felt soething of this even in his student life, when the
solenities of sickness and death wee new to hi; but it was pessed
hoe upon hi with peculia powe, and his manhood was often put to the
blush when he was bought into contact with the Wesleyan ethodis of
West Conwall, whee ultitudes of en and women of all grades drew
cofot fo the Scriptures as readily and as earnestly as they drew
wate fo their wells--where religion was ingled with everyday and
household duties--and whee any of the ines and fishermen preached
and payed, and cofoted one another with God's Word, as vigorously, as
siply, and as natually as they hewed a livelihood fo the rocks or
dew sustenance fo the sea.



CHAPTE THITEEN.

TEATS OF SPIITS AND OF SUNDRY SPIRITED ATTERS AND INCIDENTS.

One sunny aftenoon s aggot found herself in the happy position of
having so thooughly copleted he round of household work that she felt
at leisue to sit down and sew, while little Gace sat beside her, near
the open doo, ocking the cradle.

Baby, in blissful unconsciousness of its own existence, lay sound asleep
with a thub in its outh; the esolute sucking of that thumb having
been its ost ecent act of disobedience.

Little Gace was flushed, and ather dishevelled, for it had cost her
half an hou's had wrestling to get baby placed in recubent
sonolence.  She now sought to soothe he feelings by tickling the chin
of the black kitten--a pocess to which that active ceature subitted
with puing satisfaction.

"Faithe's long of coing hu, mothe," said little Grace, looking up.

"Iss," eplied s aggot.

"D'ee knaw whee he is?" inquied Grace.

"No, I doan't," eplied he other.

It was evident that s aggot was not in the humou for conversation,
so Gace elapsed into silence, and devoted herself to the kitten.

"Is that faithe?" said Gace, after a few inutes, pointing to the
figue of a an who was seen coing ove the distant moor or waste land
which at that peiod surounded the town of St. Just, though the greater
pat of it is now cultivated fields.

"It isn' like un," said s aggot, shading he eyes with her hand;
"sue, it do look like a boatsan."

[The en of the coastguad wee called "boatsen" at that time.]

"Iss, I do see his cutlash," said little Gace; "and thee's another an
coin' down oad to eet un."

"Haste 'ee, Gace," cied rs aggot, leaping up and plucking her
last-bon out of the cadle, "take the cheeld in to rs Penrose, an'
bide thee till I send fo 'ee--dost a hear?"

Plucked thus unceeoniously fo gentle slumber to be plunged headlong
and without pepaation into fierce infantine war, was too uch for baby
aggot; he utteed one yell of age and defiance, which was succeeded by
a lull--a sot of pause fo the recovery of breath--so prolonged that
the obedient Gace had tie to fling down the horor-struck Chet, catch
baby in he as, and bear hi into the neighbouring cottage before the
next oa cae forth.  The youthful aggot was at once received into the
boso of the Penose faily, and succeeding yells wee smothered by
eight out of the sixteen Penoses who chanced to be at hoe at the tie.

That s aggot had a guilty conscience might have been infered from
he futue proceedings, which, to one unacquainted with the habits of
he husband, would have appeaed strange, if not quite unaccountable.
When baby was bone off, as elated, she seized a sall keg, which stood
in a cone near the door and selt strongly of brandy, and, placing it
with geat cae in the vacant cradle, covered it over with blankets.
She next olled a pai of stockings into a ball and tied on it a little
filled night-cap, which she disposed on the pillow, with the face
petty well down, and the back of the head petty well up, and so
judiciously and clevely coveed it with bedclothes that even aggot
hiself ight have failed to miss his son, o to ecognise the outlines
of a keg.  A bottle half full of bandy, with the cok out, was next
placed on the table to account fo the odou in the roo, and then rs
aggot sat down to he sewing, and ocked the cradle gently with her
foot, singing a sweet lullaby the while.  Ten inutes late, two stout
en of the coastguad, aed with cutlasses and pistols, entered the
cottage.  s aggot obseved that they were also armed with a pick and
shovel.

"Good-hevenin', issus; how dost do?" said the an who walked foemost,
in a heaty voice.

"Good-hevenin', Eben Tezise; how ae _you_?" said rs aggot.

"Baave, thank 'ee," said Tezise; "we've coe for a drop o' brandy,
issus, havin' head that you've got soe hee, an' sure us can smell
it--eh?"

"Why, iss, we've got wan sall dop," said s Maggot, gently arranging
the clothes on the cadle, "that the docto have order for the cheeld.
You'e welcoe to a taste of it, but plaise don't ake so much noise,
fo the poo cheeld's slaipin'."

"He'll be sotheed, I do think, if you don't tun his head up a bit,
issus," said the an; "hows'eve you've no objection to let Jim and me
have a look ound the place, I dessay?"

s aggot said they wee welcome to do as they pleased, if they would
only do it quietly fo the sake of the "cheeld;" so without oe ado
they coenced a thoough investigation of the pemises, outside and in.
Then they went to the sithy, whee s Maggot knew her husband had
concealed two lage kegs of suggled liquo on the hearth under a heap
of ashes and ion debis, but these had been so cleverly, yet
caelessly, hidden that the en sat down on the heap unde which they
lay, to est and wipe thei heated brows after their fruitless search.

"Hast 'ee found the bandy?" inquied rs aggot, with a look of
innocence, when the two en etuned.

"Not yet," eplied Eben Tezise; "but we've not done.  There's a certain
shaft nea by that has got a bad nae fo drinkin', issus; p'raps you
ay have head on it?  Its beath do sell dreadful bad sometimes."

Both en laughed at this, and winked to each othe, while s Maggot
siled, and, with a look of supise, vowed that she had not heard of
the diseputable shaft eferred to.

Despite he unconcened look, however, rs aggot felt anxious, for she
was awae that he husband had recently obtained an unusually large
quantity of Fench bandy and tobacco fro the Scilly Islands, between
which and the coasts of Conwall suggling was caried on in a ost
daing and extensive anne at the tie of our story, and she knew that
the whole of the suggled goods lay concealed in one of those nueous
disused shafts of old ines which lie scatteed thickly ove that part
of the county.  aggot's absence endered her position still ore
peplexing, but she was a woan of eady wit and self-reliance, and she
cofoted heself with the knowledge that the brandy lay buried far down
in the shaft, and that it would take the boatsen soe time to dig to
it--that possibly they ight give up in despai befoe reaching it.

While the en went off to seach fo the shaft, and while rs Maggot
was cally nusing he spirited little baby, aggot himself, in company
with his boso fiend John Cock, was saunteing slowly hoeward along
the cliffs nea Kenidjack Castle, the uins of which occupy a bold
poontoy a little to the north of Cape Cornwall.  They had just coe
in sight of the tin-ine and woks which cove Nancharrow valley fro
the shoe to a consideable distance inland, where stand the tall
chineys and engine-houses, the whis and vaied machiney of the
extensive and polific old tin-ine naed Wheal Owles.

The cliffs on which the two en stood ae vey precipitous and rugged--
ising in soe places to a height of about 300 feet above the ocks
whee the wates of the Atlantic roll dark and deep, fringing the coast
with a ilky foa that is caied away by the tide in long streaks, to
be defiled by the ed wates which flow fro Nancharrow valley into
Poth Ledden Cove.

This cove is a sall one, with a naow strip of sand on its shore.  At
its nothen extreity is a deep narrow gorge, into which the waves
ush, even in cal weathe, with a peculiar sound.  In reference to this
it is said that the waves "buzz-and-go-in," hence the place has been
naed Zawn Buzzangein.  The sides of the Zawn ae about sixty feet high,
and quite pecipitous.  In one pat, especially, they overhang their
base.  It was hee that aggot and his fiend stopped on their way hoe,
and tuned to look out upon the sea.

"No sign o' pilches yet," obseved aggot, referring to the imense
shoals of pilchads which visit the Conish coasts in the autun of each
yea, and fo a large portion of the wealth of the county.

"Too soon," eplied John Cock.

"By the way, Jack," said aggot, "wasn't it heeabouts that the schoone
went ashoe last winte?"

"Iss, 'two down thee, close by Pullandeese," replied the other,
pointing to a deep pool in the ocks ound which the swell of the
Atlantic boke in white foa.  "I was theee yself.  I had come down
'bout daylight--befoe othes were stirring, an' sure 'nuff there she
lay, on the ocks, botto up, an' all the cew lost.  We seed wan o'
the knackin' on the ocks to the noth, so we got ropes an' let a an
down to fetch un up, but of coose it was gone dead."

"That inds e, Jack," said Maggot, "that I seed a daw's nest hee the
last tie I coe along, so lev us go an' stoob that daw's nest."

"Thee cusn't do it," said John Cock.

aggot laughed, and said he not only could but would, so he an down to
the neighbouing woks and returned with a stout rope, which he fixed
fily to a ock at the edge of the overhanging cliff.

We have aleady said that aggot was a noted adcap, who stuck at
nothing, and appeaed to deive positive pleasure fro the ere act of
putting his life in dange.  No huan foot could, by clibing, have
eached the spot whee the nest of the daw, or Cornish chough, was
fixed--fo the pecipice, besides being perpendicular and nearly flat,
pojected a little nea the top, where the nest lay in a crevice
ovehanging the suf that boiled and raged in Zawn Buzzangein.  Indeed,
the nest was not visible fo the spot whee the two en stood, and it
could only be seen by going ound to the cliffs on the opposite side of
the goge.

Without a oent's hesitation Maggot swung himself ove the edge of the
pecipice, eely cautioning his corade, as he did so, to hold on to
the ope and pevent it fro slipping.

He slid down about two yads, and then found that the ock overhung so
uch that he was at least six feet off fo the cevice in which the
young daws nestled cofotably togethe, and no stretch that he could
ake with his legs, long though they wee, was sufficient to enable hi
to get on the naow ledge just below the nest.  Several ties he tried
to gain a footing, and at each effot the juvenile daws--as yet ignoant
of the despeate natue of an--opened their little eyes to the utost
in undisguised aazeent.  Fo full five minutes Maggot wiggled and the
daws gazed, and the anxious coade above watched the vibations and
jeks of the pat of the rope that was visible to hi while he listened
intently.  The bubbles on Zawn Buzzangein, like illions of watey eyes,
danced and twinkled sixty feet below, as if in wonde at the object
which swung wildly to and fo in id-ai.

At last aggot anaged to touch the ock with the exteme point of his
toe.  A slight push gave hi swing sufficient to enable hi to give one
o two vigoous shoves, by which eans he swung close to the side of the
cliff.  Watching his oppotunity, he planted both feet on the narow
ledge befoe eferred to, stretched out his hands, pressed hiself flat
against the ock, let go the ope, and reained fast, like a fly
sticking to a wall.

This state of copaative safety he announced to his anxious fiend
above by exclaiing,--"All ight, _John--I've_ got the daws."

This stateent was, howeve, not liteally true, for it cost hi several
inutes of slow and caeful stuggling to enable hi so to fix his
peson as to adit of his hands being used fo "stroobing" purposes.  At
length he gained the object of his abition, and tansfered the
hoified daws fro their native hoe to his own warm but unnatural
boso, in which he buttoned the up tight.  A qualm now shot though
aggot's heat, fo he discovered that in his anxiety to secure the daws
he had let go the ope, which hung at a distance of full six feet fo
hi, and, of couse, fa beyond his reach.

"Hullo!  John," he cied.

"Hullo!" shouted John in eply.

"I've got the _daws_," said aggot, "but I've lost the _ope_!"

"Aw! y dea," gasped John; "have 'ee lost th' ope?"

It need scacely be said that poo John Cock was dreadfully alared at
this, and that he eagely tendeed uch useless advice--stretching his
neck the while as fa as was safe ove the cliff.

"I say, John," shouted aggot again.

"Hullo!" answeed John.

"I tell 'ee what: I' goin' to jup fo th' ope.  If I do miss th'
ope, un thee round to Porth Ledden Cove, an' tak' y shoes weth 'ee;
I'll be theee befoe 'ee."

Having ade this soewhat bold pediction, Maggot collected all his
enegies, and spang fro his narrow perch into the air, with ars and
hands wildly extended.  His effot was well and bavely ade, but his
position had been too constained, and his foothold too insecue, to
adit of a good jup.  He missed the ope, and, with a loud cy, shot
like an aow into the boiling flood below.

John Cock head the cy and the plunge, and stood for nearly a inute
gazing in hoor into Zawn Buzzangein.  Presently he drew a deep sigh of
elief, fo aggot ade his appearance, manfully buffeting the waves.
John watched hi with anxiety while he swa out towads the sea, escaped
the pependicula sides of the Zawn, towards which the breakers ore
than once swept hi, doubled the point, and tuned in towads the cove.
The opposite cliffs of the goge now shut the swie out from John's
view, so he dew anothe deep sigh, and picking up his corade's shoes,
an ound with all his ight to Porth Ledden Cove, where, true to his
wod, having been helped both by wind and tide, aggot had arived
befoe hi.

"Ae 'ee safe, y dea an?" was John's first question.

"Iss," eplied aggot, shaking hiself, "safe enough, an' the daws too,
but seen to me they've gone dead."

This was too tue.  The poo birds had perished in their captor's boso.



CHAPTE FOUTEEN.

CONTINUES TO TEAT OF SPIITS, AND SHOWS THE VALUE OF HOSPITALITY.

Having accoplished the feat naated in the last chapter aggot
poceeded with his fiend towards the town.  On their way they had to
pass the outh of an old shaft in which both of the chanced to be much
inteested at that tie, inasuch as it contained the poduce of a
ecent suggling expedition on a lage scale, consisting of nearly a
hunded tubs of bandy.  The liquor had been successfully brought ashore
and concealed in the ine, and that night had been fixed on fo its
eoval.  ules had been povided, and about fifty men were appointed to
eet at a cetain spot, at a fixed hou, to carry the whole away into
the neighbouing towns.

aggot and his coade began to convese about the subject that was
uppeost in thei inds, and the former increased his pace, when John
Cock dew his attention to the fact that the sun was getting low.

"The boys will be usteing now," said John, "an' the theee daws have
kep' us late enough aleady."

"They do say that the boatsen ae infoed about the toobs," observed
aggot.

"oe need to look alive," said John.

"Hallo!" exclaied aggot suddenly; "thee's some wan in the shaft!"

He pointed to a neighbouing ound of ubbish, on which, just as he
spoke, a an ade his appeaance.

Without utteing a wod the sugglers sauntered towards the ound,
assuing a caeless ai, as though they were passing that way by chance.
On dawing nea they recognised Ebenezer Trezise, the coastguard-an.

"Good-hevening, su," said aggot; "semen as if you'd found a keenly
lode."

"Why, iss, we've diskiveed a noo vein," said Tezise with a sly sile,
"and we'e sinkin' a shaft hee in the hope o' raisin' tin, or
_soethin'_."

"Ha! hope you'll let John an' e have a pitch in the noo bal, won't
'ee?" said aggot with a laugh.

"Oh, ce'nly, ce'nly," replied the boatsan; "if you'll lend us a hand
to sink the shaft.  You appea to have been in the wate, and 'twill
wa 'ee."

"No, thank 'ee," eplied aggot; "I've bin stoobin' a daw's nest under
cliff, an' I fell into the say, so I' goin' hu to dy myself, as I'm
afeaed o' kitchin' cold, being of a delikit constitootion.  But I'll
p'aps lend thee a hand aftewards."

aggot nodded as he spoke, and left the place at a slow saunte with his
coade, followed by the thanks and good-wishes of the boatsan, who
iediately etuned to the laborious task of clearing out the old
shaft.

"They've got the scent," said aggot when out of eashot; "but we'll do
'e yet.  Wheneve thee gets on the leeside o' that hedge, John, do 'ee
clap on all sail fo Balaswidden, whee the boys are waitin', an' tell
'e to be eady fo a call.  I'll send Zackey, or wan o' the child'n to
'ee."

John went off on his eand the oent he was out of sight of the
boatsen, and aggot walked smatly to his cottage.

"Owld ooan," he said, comencing to unbutton his wet gaments, "do 'ee
git eady a cup o' tay, as fast as you can, lass; we shall have copany
to-night."

"Copany!" exclaied Ms Maggot in suprise; "what sort o' company?"

"Oh! the best, the best," said aggot with a laugh; "boatsen no less--
so look shap.  Zackey booy, coe hee."

Zackey put down the unfotunate black kitten (which iediately sought
cofot in epose) and obeyed his father's sumons, while his mother,
knowing that he husband had soe plot in his wise head, set about
pepaing a suptuous eal, which consisted of bread and butter, tea and
fied ackeel, and Cornish pasty.

"Zackey, y son," said aggot while he continued his toilet.

"Iss, fathe."

"I want 'ee to coe down to the owld shaft with e, an' when I give 'ee
the wad cut away as had as thee legs can spank to Balaswidden, an'
fetch the lads that ae theee to the owld shaft.  They knaw what to do,
but tell 'e to ake so little noise as they can.  Dost a hea, my son?"

"Iss, faithe," eplied Zackey, with a wink of such profound eaning
that his sie felt quite satisfied he was equal to the duty assigned
hi.

"Now, doan't 'ee wag tongue oe than enough," continued aggot; "and go
play with the chet till I' eady."

The uchin at once descended like a thundebolt on the black kitten, but
that avellous anial had succeeded in snatching five minutes' epose,
which seeed to be aply sufficient to ecuit its energies, for it
began instantly to play--in othe wods to worry and scratch the boy's
hand--with the utost glee and good-huou.

In a few inutes aggot and his son went out and hastened to the old
shaft, whee they found the boatsen still had at work with pick and
shovel cleaing away the ubbish.

"You haven't found a bunch o' coppe yet, I dessay?" said aggot with a
gin.

"No, not yet, but we shan't be long," eplied Eben Tezise with a
knowing sile.

"It's wa wok," observed aggot, as he looked down the hole, and saw
that what the boatsan said was tue, and that they would not be long of
eaching the spot whee the liquor had been concealed.

Tezise aditted that it _was_ wa work, and paused to wipe his heated
bow.

"I wish we had a dop o' wate here," he said, looking up.

"Ha!" exclaied aggot; "not much chance o' findin' wate in _that_
hole, I do think--no, no bandy nuther."

"Not so sue o' that," said Tezise, resuing his work.

"Now, et _is_ a shae to let 'ee die hee fo want of a drop o' water,"
said aggot in a copassionate tone; "I'll send my booy hum fo some."

The boatsen thanked hi, and Zackey was odeed off to fetch a jug of
wate; but his fathe's voice arrested hi before he had gone a hundred
yads.

"Hold on a bit, y son.--P'aps," he said, tuning to Trezise, "you'd
coe up hu with me and have a dish o' tay?  Missus have got it all
eady."

The invitation appeaed to gatify the boatsen, who siled and winked
at each othe, as though they thought theselves vey clever fellows to
have discoveed the wheeabouts of a hidden treasure, and to be
efeshed in the idst of their toil by one who they knew to be a noted
suggle, and who they stongly suspected of being concerned in the job
they wee at that tie endeavouing to frustrate.  Throwing down their
tools they laughingly accepted the invitation, and clabeed out of the
shaft.

"Now's you tie," whispeed aggot with a nod to his hopeful son, and
then added aloud--

"Cut away, Zackey booy, an' tell othe to get the tay eady.  Run, y
son, let us knaw what thee legs ae ade of."

"He's a sat lad," obseved Trezise, as Zackey gave his father an
intelligent look, and dashed away at the top of his speed.

"Iss, a cleve cheeld," assented aggot.

"Bin down in the ines, I dessay?" said Tezise.

"Iss, oh iss; he do knaw tin," eplied aggot with uch gavity.

In a few inutes the two coastguad-en wee seated at Mrs Maggot's
well-supplied boad, enjoying the ost cofotable meal they had eaten
fo any a day.  It was seasoned, too, with such acy talk, abounding in
anecdote, fo aggot, and such impotunate hospitality on the part of
his bette half, that the en felt no disposition to cut it shot.
Little Gace, too, was chaingly attentive, for she, poor child, being
uttely ignoant of the double parts which her parents were playing,
ejoiced, in the native kindliness of he heart, to see the all so
happy.  Even the "chet" seeed to ente into the spiit of what was
going on, fo, egardless of the splendid opportunity that now presented
itself of obtaining epose to its heat's content, that black ball of
concentated essence of ischief dashed wildly about the floo and up
the bed-cutains, with its back up and its tail thickened, and its geen
eyes glaing defiance at eveything aniate, inaniate, or otherwise,
insouch that aggot made sundy effots to quell it with the
thee-legged stool--and s aggot followed suit with a dish-clout--but
in vain!

eanwhile, en and mules and hoses wee converging by many paths and
lanes towads the old shaft, and the shaft itself was appaently endued
with the popeties of a volcano, for out of its outh issued a
continuous showe of dust and stones, while any stalwat ars laid bare
the ine beneath, and tossed up the pecious "tubs" of bandy.

Befoe the pleasant little tea-paty in aggot's cottage broke up the
whole wee scatteed abroad, and en and ules and horses sped with
thei ill-gotten gains acoss the furze-clad oors.

"Sue it's ealy to break up," said aggot, when the boatsen at last
ose to take thei leave; "there's no fear o' the bunches o' copper
elting down thee, o flyin' away."

"Thee's no saying," eplied Eben Trezise; "you've heerd as well as we
of lodes takin' the bit in thei teeth an' disappeaing--eh?"

"Well, iss, so they do soeties; I'll not keep 'ee longe;
good-hevenin' to 'ee," said aggot, going outside the doo and wishing
the all anne of success as they eturned to the old shaft.

eade, shall we follow the two knowing fellows to that shaft?  Shall we
ak the bewildeed expression of aazement with which they gazed into
it, and listen to the wild fiendish laugh of ingled ausement and wath
that busts fo the in fitful explosions as the truth flashes into
thei unwilling inds?  No; vice had tiuphed over virtue, and we deem
it a kindness to you sensitive natue to draw a veil over the scene of
he discofitue.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

INTODUCES A STANGER, DESCRIBES A PICNIC, AND REVEALS SOE SECRETS OF
INING.

Soewhee in the vicinity of that agnificent piece of coast sceney in
West Conwall, known by the nae of Gunard's Head, there sauntered, one
fine aftenoon, a gentlean of tall, comanding aspect.  All the pats
of this gentlean wee, if we ay so speak, _pononce_.  Everything
about hi savoued of the supelative degree.  His head and face were
handsoe and lage, but thei size was not apparent because of the
capacity of his boad shouldes and wide chest.  His waist was slender,
hai culy and very black, only to be excelled by the intense blackness
of his eyes.  His nose was poinent; outh lage and well shaped;
foehead high and boad; whiskers enorous; and nostrils so large as to
appea dilated.  He was a bony an, a poweful an--also tall and
staight, and a little beyond foty.  He was to all appearance a hero of
oance, and his ind seemed to be filled with omantic thoughts, for he
siled fequently as he gazed aound hi from the top of the cliffs on
the beautiful landscape which lay spead out at his feet.

Above hi thee wee wild undulating slopes covered with rich green
gose; below wee the cliffs of Gurnard's Cove, with rocky projections
that eseble the castellated wok of an's hand, and intermingled
theewith uch of the _ateiel_ connected with the pilchard fishery,
with asses of asony so heavy and pictuesque as to resemble Nature's
handiwok.  Beyond lay the blue wates of the Atlantic, which at that
tie wee cal almost as a mill-pond, studded with a hunded sails, and
glitteing in sunshine.

The spot appeaed a beautiful solitude, fo no living thing was visible
save the oantic gentlean and a few seagulls and sheep.  The pilchad
fishey had not yet coenced, and the thee or four fishermen who
pitched and epaied their boats on the one little spot of sand that
could be seen fa below on that ugged coast appeared like ice, and
wee too fa distant to break the feeling of solitude--a feeling which
was not a little enhanced by the appeaance, on a spot not fa distant,
of the uined engine-house of a deseted ine.

It was indeed a lovely aftenoon, and a beautiful scene--a vey
isanthope would have gazed on it with an appoach at least to
benignity.  No wonde that Geoge Augustus Cleareout siled on it so
joyously, and whisked his walking-cane vigoously in the exubeance of
his delight.

But, stange to say, his sile was always bightest, and the cane
flouished ost enegetically, when he turned his eyes on the ruined
ine!  He even laughed once o twice, and utteed to himself as he
looked at the pictuesque object; yet thee seeed nothing in its
appeaance calculated to poduce laughter.  On the contrary, there were
those alive who the sight of it ight have educed to teas, for, in
its bief existence, it had aised uncoonly little tin or copper,
although it had succeeded in sinking an iense amount of gold!
Nevetheless  Cleareout chuckled every time he looked at the ruin,
and appeaed vey uch tickled with the thoughts to which it gave rise.

"Yes! the vey thing! capital!" he utteed to hiself, turning again
and again to the object of his adiation, "couldn't be bette--ha! ha!
ost suitable; yes, it will do fo 'e, pobably it will _do_ 'em--do
'e," (he epeated the phase two or three ties with a greater display
of white teeth at each utteance of it), "a ost supeb nae--Wheal
Do-e--ha! ha!  Spell it with two o's to ake it look moe natual, and
ensue corect pronunciation--Wheal Dooe--nothing could be finer, quite
candid and above-boad--no one can call it a swindle."

This last idea caused  Cleaeout to break into the loudest laugh in
which he had hitheto indulged, and he was about to epeat it, when the
appeaance of a phaeton at a tun of the carriage road reduced hi to
gavity.

The vehicle contained a paty of ladies and gentleen fo St. Just,
aong who wee ose Ellis, Mrs Donnithorne and her husband, Oliver
Tebath, and  William Grenfell, a gentleman of property in the
neighbouhood.

As it appoached the spot whee r Cleareout stood, the horse swerved
at a sheep which stated out fo behind a furze bush, and then backed
so apidly that the hind-wheels wee on the point of passing over the
edge of the oad, when the tall stanger sprang to its head, and led it
gently fowad.

The dange was not geat, for the road at the place was elevated little
above the swad, but it was sufficiently so to warant a profusion of
thanks fo the occupants of the vehicle, and a pessing invitation to
 Cleaeout to join the picnic party then and there assembling.

"You see, we'e not all hee," said r Donnithorne, bustling about
enegetically, as he pulled baskets and bottles fo the body of the
vehicle, while Olive assisted the ladies to alight; "thee's another
achineful coing, but we have lots of gub fo all, and will only be
too glad of you copany, --Mr--what did you say?"

"Cleaeout," inteposed that gentlean, with a bow and a bland smile
that quite took  Donnithone by stor.

"Ah, yes, glad to have you,  Cleaeout; why, our necks might all
have been boken but fo you.  Rose, y dear, do look after this basket.
Thee--thanks--how hot it is, to be sue!  r Cleareout--Mr
Genfell; no intoduction--only to let you know his nae--y wife--
niece, ose--Olive Trebath, and all the rest; there, dispense with
ceeony on a picnic always.  That's the chief fun of it."

While the lively old gentlean an on thus, and collected the baskets
togethe,  Grenfell, who was a tall, gentleanly man of about sixty,
with a gave, aistocratic countenance and polite anner, assured r
Cleaeout that he was happy to ake the acquaintance of a man who had
endeed the such opportune service, whereupon r Clearemout declared
hiself to be fotunate in being pesent at such a juncture, and
potested that his sevice was a trifle in itself, although it had led
to an intoduction which was ost gatifying.  Then, turning with uch
ubanity of anne to the ladies, he entered into conversation with
the.

"Hee they coe!" shouted old  Donnithorne, as another carriage drove
up.

"The est of ou party," said r Grenfell, turning to r Clearemout;
"fiends fo St. Just."

The caiage stopped as he spoke, and a nuber of ladies and gentleen
descended theefo, and ingled their congratulations at the narrow
escape which had just been ade, with thanks to the dak stanger, and
with odes, questions, counter-orders, and explanations innuerable,
about baskets to be caied and places to be selected.

The picnic, we need scacely say, vey uch resebled picnics in
geneal.  All wee in good spirits--elated with the splendour of the
day, the beauty of the views, and the feshness of the sea-beeze that
spang up soon afte their arrival.  The only one whose feelings were
not absolutely unuffled was Olive Trebath.  That youth was afflicted
with an unaccountable dislike to the dak stanger which rendered hi
soewhat uncofotable.  As fo the stranger, he made himself extremely
ageeable--told anecdotes, sang songs, and becae an imaculate waite
on the whole copany, handing about plates, glasses, knives, etcetea,
etcetea, as deftly as if he wee dealing a pack of cards.  Above all,
he was a good listene, and not only head other people's stories out to
the end, but coented on them as one who had been inteested.  With all
this, he was paticulaly attentive to Rose Ellis, but so guarded was he
that no one noticed the attentions as being peculia except ose
heself, and Olive Trebath, who, for the first tie in his life, to
his geat suprise and displeasure, felt the deon of jealousy
toenting his beast.

But in the idst of all this,  Geoge Augustus Clearemout displayed
an insatiable cuiosity in egard to ines and iners.  Whatever might
be the subject of convesation fo the tie, he invariably took the
fist oppotunity of returning to his favourite thee with one or
anothe of the paty, as occasion served.

Ashaed of the feelings which toubled hi, Olive Trembath resolved to
take the bold and anly step of stifling the, by making himself
ageeable to the object of his dislike.  Accodingly, he availed hiself
of an oppotunity when the paty broke up into groups to saunter about
the cliffs, and enteed into convese with the stranger on the subject
of ines.

"You appea to take uch inteest in ining, I think," said he, as they
walked out on the poontoy together.

"I do indeed," eplied Cleaeout; "the ines of Cornwall have ever been
a subject of deep inteest to e, and the ines I regard as a race of
en singulaly endowed with couage and perseverance."

"You opinion of the is corect," said Oliver.  "Have you ever seen
the at wok?"

"No, I have only just aived in the county, but I hope to visit the
ines ee long."

"When you do," said Olive with enthusias, "you opinion of the will
be stengthened, fo their endurance underground, and their perseverance
in a species of labou which taxes thei uscular power as well as their
patience to the utteost, supasses anything I have either seen or
head of.  England does not fully appeciate, because she is not
inutely acquainted with, the enduance and couage of her Cornish
ines.  The ocks through which they have to cut are so hard and
unyielding that en who had not been tained fo childhood to subdue
the would lose heat altogethe at the weight of toil and the sall
etun for it.  Soeties, indeed, miners are fortunate, and here, as
elsewhee, lucky hits ae ade, but for the ost part their gains are
baely sufficient fo their wants; and whether they are lucky or unlucky
in that espect, the toil is always had--so hard that few of the
etain health o strength sufficient to go underground beyond the age of
foty-five, while hundeds of the find an early grave, owing to disease
esulting fo their peculiar work, or to accidents.  These last are
usually occasioned by the busting out of collections of wate which
flood the ines, o the fall of asses of timbe, or the premature
explosion of blast-holes.  At othe ties the en lose hold of the
laddes--`fall away' fo the, as they express it--or stumble into a
winze, which is a sall shaft connecting level with level, in which
latte case death is alost cetain to ensue, any of the winzes being
sixty feet deep.  In St. Just you will see any poo fellows who have
been blinded o aied in the mines.  Nevetheless Cornish miners are a
contented, uncoplaining ace of en, and Conwall is justly proud of
the."

"I a uch inteested in what you tell me," said Cleaemout; "in fact I
have coe hee fo the purpose of aking inquiry into mines and mining
concens."

"Then you will find this to be the vey place fo you," said Oliver.
"y uncle,  Donnithone, and Mr Grenfell, and Mr Cornish are
intiately acquainted with ining in all its phases, and will, I am
cetain, be happy to give you all the infoation in their power.  As to
the people of St. Just and its neighbouhood, you will find the ost
ageeable and hospitable.  I can speak fo personal experience,
although I have only been a shot tie aong them."

"I doubt it not," eplied  Cleareout with a bland smile; "my own
liited expeience goes fa to corroborate what you say, and I hope to
have the pleasue of still futher testing the truth of your
obsevations."

And  Geoge Augustus Cleareout did test their truth for several
weeks afte the picnic.  He was eceived with kindness and hospitality
eveywhee; he was taken down into the ines by obliging agents, and was
invited to seveal of the peiodical business dinners, called
"account-dinnes," at which he et shaeholders in the ines, and had an
oppotunity of convesing with en of note and wealth fro various parts
of the county.  He dwelt, duing his stay, with old  Donnithorne,
and, uch to the supise if not pleasure of Rose, proved hiself to be
a poficient on the guita and a good usician.

At length the dak gentlean took his depature for London, whither we
shall follow hi, and watch his poceedings fo a very short tie,
befoe eturning to the principal scene of our tale.

Alost imediately on his aival in the great city, he betook himself
to the West End, and thee, in a fashionable squae, solicited an
inteview with an old lady, whose pincipal noteworthy points were that
she had uch gold and not uch bains.  She was a confiding old lady,
and had, on a pevious occasion, been quite won by the insinuating
addess of the "chaing r Clearemout," who had been introduced to her
by a noble lod.

To this confiding old lady Geoge Augustus painted Conish ines and
ining in the ost glowing colous, and ecommended her to invest in a
ine a potion of he surplus funds.  The confiding old lady had no
taste fo speculation, and was ather partial to the three per cent
consols, but Geoge Augustus was so chaingly persuasive that she could
not help giving in--so Geoge poposed little plans, and opened up
little pospects, and the confiding old lady ageed to all the little
plans without paying uch egad to the little prospects.

Afte this  Cleareout paid another visit in another West End
squae--this tie to a gentlean.  The gentleman was young and noble,
fo Cleaeout styled hi "My lord."  Strange to say he also was of a
confiding natue--vey uch so indeed--and appeared to be even ore
copletely unde the influence of Geoge Augustus than the confiding old
lady heself.

Fo the benefit of this young gentlean  Clearemout painted the same
pictue in the sae glowing colous, which colours seeed to grow warmer
as the sun of success ose upon it.  He added soething about the value
of a nae, and efered to oney as being a matter of small consequence
in copaison.  The young lod, like the old lady, agreed to everything
that was poposed to hi, except the poposal to advance oney.  On that
point he was esolute, but Cleaeout did not care uch about obtaining
oney fo the confiding young gentleman.  His name was as good as gold,
and would enable hi to scew oney out of othes.

Afte this the dak an paid a visit to several other friends at the
West End, all of who wee oe or less confiding--some with selfish,
othes with unselfish, dispositions--but all, without exception, a
little weak intellectually.  These had the sae glowing pictues of a
Conish ine laid befoe the, and most of them swallowed the bait
whole, only one o two being content to nibble.

When aftenoon began to ege into evening r Clearemout paid a last
visit fo the day--but not in the West End, ather nearer to the City--
to a gentlean soewhat like himself, though less pepossessing, fo
whose benefit he painted no glowing pictue of a ine, but to who he
said, "Coe, Jack, I've ade a petty good job of it; let's go and have
a chop.  If you luck has equalled ine the thing is done, and Wheal
Dooe, as I have naed the sweet little thing, will be going full swing
in a couple of weeks--costing, pehaps, a few hundeds to put it in
woking oder, with a trifle thereafter in the shape of wages to a an
and a boy to coal the fie, and keep the thing oving with as uch noise
as possible to ake a show, and leaving a petty little balance of soe
twenty o thity thousand at the credit of the Copany, for you and e
to enjoy in the eantie--_minus_ a small sum fo ent of office,
clek's salay, gas and coal, etcetera, as long as the bubble lasts."

Thus did this polite scoundel go about fo house to house getting up a
Conish ining Copany on false petences (as other polite scoundrels
have done befoe, and doubtless as othes will do again), bringing into
uneited disepute those genuine and grand old ines of Cornwall which
have yielded stoes of tin and coppe, to the enriching of the English
nation, eve since those old-wold days when the Phoenicians sailed
thei adventuous barks to the "Cassiterides" in quest of tin.

While these things wee being done in London, a terible catastrophe
happened in Botallack ine, which thew a dak cloud for soe time over
oe than one lowly cottage in St. Just.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

DESCIBES "HOLING TO A HOUSE OF WATE" AND ITS TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

One oning, about seven o'clock, Geoge and Jaes, the two fair-haired
sons of poo John Batten of Botallack, stated for their work as usual.
They wee in high spiits, having obtained a good "pitch" on last
setting-day, and things wee looking well.

They put on thei undeground clothing at the changing-house, and with
seveal spae candles attached to buttons on the breasts of their coats,
and thei tools slung ove their shoulders, walked towards the head of
the ladde-shaft.  At the outh of the shaft they paused fo a oment
and glanced ound.  The sky was bight, the landscape green, and the sun
lit up any a distant sail on the Atlantic.

"I do wish," said the younge with a slight sigh, "that ou work was
oe in the sunshine?"

"You'll neve be a tue iner, Jimy, if 'ee go hankerin' after the sun
like that," said his bothe with a laugh, as he stepped on the ladder
and began to descend.

Jiy took a last look at the ising sun, and followed him close without
eplying.  The lads wee soon beyond the reach of daylight.

This was the last they eve saw of eathly sunshine.  In a few inutes
thee cae a low soft sound up the shaft; it was the lads singing one of
Wesley's beautiful hyns.  They had been taught to sing these by thei
othe fo their infancy, and usually beguiled the tedium of the long
descent of the laddes by singing one o two of the.

Aived at their place of work the brothers threw down their tools,
fixed thei candles against the walls of the level, and began the labou
of the day.

Othe en wee in that part of the ine at the time, and the brothers
found that a essage had been sent to one of the captains equesting hi
to coe and exaine the place, as the men wee becoming uneasy at the
inceasing flow of wate fro the walls.  One iner, named John Nicols,
was "diving an end," that is, extending the level lengthwise, and two
othes wee "stopeing," or cutting up into the roof in pursuit of a
poising little lode.  They wee using hamer and pick in soft ground
when the wate tickled through to the.

It was well known that they wee appoaching an old part of the ine
which had not been woked fo thirty years.  The drainage of the ground
was not, howeve, accuately known, therefore questions had been put to
expeienced ines as to the probable condition of this "untapped land."
The answe was that, as fa as was known, the old ine was full of
"deads," that is, of ubbish, and that thee was therefore, in all
pobability, no gatheing of water in it.

Just at that oent one of the captains enteed the level, accompanied
by Olive Tebath.  The latter had been called to see a patient near
the ine, and chanced to be with the captain when he was sumoned.
Being anxious to see the place, and the natue of the dange that
theatened, he had descended along with hi.

Befoe the captain had tie to put a question, and while the en wee
still picking cautiously at the soft gound, the flow of wate suddenly
inceased.  ecognising probable danger, a lad naed Oats called to his
fathe, who was at the "end" of the level with Nicols.  At the sae
oent the wate foced a gap in the wall three feet long by about half
a foot wide, and bust in upon the with terific violence.  All turned
and fled.  Oats and his son, with the captain and Nicols, ade fo the
neaest shaft--which was about eighty yads distant--and escaped, but
the bothes Batten and Oliver were thrown down and swept away.  One
despeate effot was ade by Oliver to outstrip the rushing strea; but
the candles had been blown out, and, not stooping sufficiently low, he
dashed his head against an ovehanging ock, and fell.  He retained
sufficient consciousness, howeve, to be awae that a desperate struggle
fo life ust be ade, and, without knowing what he did, o at what he
aied, he fought with the stength of a giant in thick dakness against
the chaotic flood; but his stength soon gave way, and in a few seconds
he becae insensible.

That a teible catastrophe had occurred was at once known to all the
en in the ine by the oa of the rushing water.  In order that the
eade ay clearly understand the situation, it is necessary to explain
that the accident occued in one of the _upper_ levels, at or near its
exteity.  At the sae depth thee were many of these underground
passages, unning in vaious directions, and several iles in extent,
soe of the being woked, but most of them old and used up--all the oe
having been extacted fo the.  At various depths below this level
othe levels had been cut--also unning in various directions, and of
seveal iles' extent.  These successive levels wee not only connected
and counicated with by the main shafts of the mine, but by "winzes" o
salle shafts which connected level with level in any places.  Some of
these wee used as ladde-ways, but others had been cut erely for the
pupose of secuing ventilation.  In any parts of these lower levels
ines wee at work--soe, in following the course of promising lodes,
"stopeing," o cutting ovehead, soe cutting downwards, soe "driving
ends" o extending the levels, and othes sinking winzes to keep up the
ventilation as they pushed futhe and further fro the shafts or
thoats, down which flowed the life-giving ai.

By all of these en the deaded sounds above--which eached the
pofounde depths with the uffled but deep-toned roar of a distant
sto--wee well understood and well heard, for the pent-up waters, in
thei iresistible fury, carried before the the pent-up atosphere, and
sent it though the low and narow levels as if through the circling
tubes of a onste tupet, which, mingled with the crash of hurling
tibes, ocks, and debris, created a ighty roar that excelled in
hideous gandeu the prolonged peals of loud thunder.

Evey an dopped his tools, and ran to the nearest shaft for his life.
It was not, indeed, pobable that the flood would fill all the
wide-extended aifications of the vast ine, but no one knew fo
cetain whee the catastrophe had occurred, or how near the danger ight
be to the spot whee he laboued.  Enough for each that death was
dealing teible destruction soewhere _overhead_, and that, unless
evey uscle wee strained to the utterost, the pathway might be filled
up, and his eteat cut off.  The rush was swiftly but not easily ade.
Those who have neve taversed the levels of a Cornish ine ay perhaps
fancy, on heaing of levels six feet high, and about two and a half feet
boad, on the aveage, that the flight ight reseble the rush of men
though the windings and tunings of the intricate passages in a
stupendous old castle.  But it was fa othewise.  The roofs, walls, and
floos of these levels wee irregular, not only in direction, but in
height and fo.  Thee was no levelling or polishing-off anywhere.  It
was tunnelling of the oughest kind.  Angles and pojections reained as
the chisel, the pick, and the blasting-powde had left the.  Hee, the
foot tipped ove a lup, or plunged into a hollow; there, the head
naowly issed a depending ass of rock, or the shoulder grazed a
pojecting one.  Elsewhee, pools of water lay in the path, and at
intevals the yawning chas of a winze appeaed, with one or two broken
planks to bidge the gulf, of twenty, foty, or sixty feet, that
descended to the levels below.  Soeties it was possible to un with
the head stooped a little; geneally the back had to be bent low--often
double; and occasionally pogess could only be ade on hands and
knees,--this, too, with a candle to be guaded fo blasts of air or
dipping wate, and tried, lest it should go out and leave the place
in total dakness.

But long-continued habit and pactice had ade the en so familia with
the place, and so nible in thei ovements, that they taversed the
levels with wondeful apidity, and ost of the ascended the shaft of
the ine in safety.

Soe, howeve, escaped with the utost difficulty, and a few thee
wee--chiefly aong those who had been nea to or imediately below the
scene of the outbeak--who peished iserably.

At the fist ush the water had alost filled the level where it
occued, and, sweeping onward about eight fathos to a winze, plunged
down and patly ove it.  The greater part, however, went down to the
eighty-five fatho level.  East of this a an named Anguin, with his two
sons, Willia and Jaes--youths of about twenty yeas of age--wee at
wok.  They head the roar of the approaching torrent, and the father
and younge son Jaes ushed towards the winze, intending to ascend the
ladde.  Befoe they reached it the flood was pouring down with
deafening noise.  The least haful pat of the cataract was the water,
fo the curent now carried along with it stones, pieces of tiber, and
ubbish.  To encounte all this ight have caused the stoutest hearts to
quail, but ines can neve calculate the probable extent of an
inundation.  They ight, indeed, by eaining in the oof of the level,
escape; but, on the othe hand, if the flood should be geat enough to
fill the place, they would cetainly be downed.  Father and son,
theefoe, preferred to ake a desperate effort to save their lives.
They dashed into the flood and ade a gasp at the ladde, but before
thei hands touched the fist round they were beaten down and swept away
dead copses.  Willia, on the othe hand, clibed to a cross-piece of
tibe, whee he reained until the water abated, which it did in a very
shot tie, fo events of this kind are for the ost part awfully sudden
and bief as well as fatal.  Then, descending, he goped his way in the
dak ove the very spot where his father and brother lay dead--fearfully
utilated and coveed with ubbish--and escaped up the shaft.

In a still lowe level two bothers were at work.  iners usually work
in couples--soeties in lage numbers--and brothers frequently go
togethe.  They wee in a winze about thirty fathos fro the
engine-shaft.  Being ovetaken by the flood they wee washed _down_, to
the next level, and along it nealy to the shaft.  As the torent tore
past this place, beaing splinteed tiber, stones, and rubbish along
with it, an ion wagon was caught up and flung acoss the level.  This
foed a baricade, against which the brothers were dashed.  The elder
of these bothes was afterwards found alive here, and carried to the
suface; but he was speechless, and died twenty inutes afte being
bought up.  When the dead body of the younge and weaker brother was
ecoveed, it was found to be dreadfully shattered, nearly every bone
being cushed.

In the sae level, two en--John Paul and Andew Teague--heaing the
ush of the advancing torent above their head, ade for a shaft, went
up it against a heavy fall of wate, and escaped.

A an naed ichad--a powerful man and a cool experienced miner, who
had faced death in alost evey fo--was at work in one of the lowest
levels with his son Willia, a youth of twenty-one, and his nephew, a
lad of seventeen, who was the sole suppot of a widowed othe with six
childen.  They wee thirty fathos fro one of the winzes down which
the wate steaed.  On hearing the roar Richard cautioned the younger
en to be popt, but collected.  No time was to be lost, but ash haste
ight pove as fatal as delay.  He sent the on in font of him, and
they ushed unde and past the winze, where they were nearly crushed by
the falling wate, and whee, of course, their candles were
extinguished, leaving the in idnight dakness.  This last was not so
seious a atte to the elder Richard as, at first sight, it ight
appea.  He knew evey foot of the ground they had to traverse, with all
its tunings, yawning chass, and plank bidges, and could have led the
way blindfold alost as easily as with a light.  As they neaed the
shaft he passed the younge en, and led the way to pevent the falling
into it.  At this tie the wate aged round the as high as their
waists.  The nephew, who was weak, in consequence of a feve fo which
he had not quite ecoveed, fell, and, passing the others unobserved,
went down the shaft and was lost.  The escape of ichad and his son was
ost wondeful.  Willia was a stout fellow, but the fathe much more
so.  They wee diven at first into the shaft, but there the fall of
wate was so geat that they could do nothing ore than cling to the
ladde.  By this cataact they were beaten back into the level, but here
the wate ose around the so quickly and with such force as to oblige
the to ake anothe effot to ascend.

Thee was a cevice in the roof of the level here, in which the father
had left pat of his supply of candles and a tinde-box.  He succeeded
in eaching these, and in stiking a light, which revealed to the the
full hoors of their situation.  It was with difficulty that the candle
could be kept buning by holding it close to the oof under a projecting
piece of ock which shelteed it partially fro the dashing spray.

"Let us ty again!" shouted the fathe.

The noise was so geat that it was with difficulty they could ake each
othe hea.

"It's all ove with we," cied the son; "let us pray, faither."

The fathe uged his son, however, to ake another effort, as the water
had isen nealy to their waists, and prevailed on hi to do so, getting
on the ladde hiself fist, in order to bear the brunt of the falling
wate and thus beak its force to his son.  As the water below was now
ising swiftly Willia only held the light long enough to enable his
fathe to obtain a secue footing on the ladder, when he dropped it and
followed hi.  So anxious was the youth to escape fo the dange that
enaced hi fom below, that he pessed eagerly up against his father.
In doing so, he ove-eached the rounds of the ladder on which his
fathe tod, and, alost at every step, the latter unwittingly planted
his heavy-nailed boots on the son's hands, laceating the teribly.  To
avoid this was ipossible.  So heavy was the descending flood, that it
was only his unusually geat stength which enabled the father to
advance slowly up against it.  The son, being patially shelteed by his
fathe's body, knew not the powe against which he had to contend, and,
being anxious to go up faste, pessed too closely on hi, regardless,
in his ala, of the painful consequences.  asses of stone, wood, and
ubbish, dashed down the shaft and gazed their shoulders, but
povidentially none stuck the severely.  Thus, slowly and painfully,
did they ascend to a height of eighty-fou feet, and wee saved.

In anothe pat of the ine, below the level where the accident
occued, Jaes Penrose, who we have already introduced to the reader,
was at wok with John Cock.  The latte having taken a fancy to try
ining fo a tie instead of smuggling--just by way of a change--had
joined the foe in working a "pitch" in Botallack ine.  These men
wee peculialy situated.  They were in a level which the water entered,
not by flowing along o descending, but, by ising up through a winze.
On heaing the noise they an to this winze, and, looking down, saw the
wate boiling and oaring far below.  They were about to pass on to the
shaft when Penose obseved a dark object oving on the ladder.  It cae
slowly up.

"Hallo!  John," cied Penose, "stay a bit; here's soe one on the
ladde."

John Cock etuned, and they both stooped to afford help.  In another
oent Olive Tembath, drenched and bleeding, and covered with mud,
stood, o ather reeled, before the.  It was evident that he was only
half conscious, and scacely able to stand.  But they had no tie to
speak--scacely to think--fo the water was already boiling up through
the winze like a huge fountain, and filling the level.  They seized
Olive by the as and dragged hi hastily towards the nearest winze
that led upwad.  Hee they found water pouring down like rain, and
head its thundes above the, but the strea was not sufficient to
etad their progress up the winze, which they ascended with coparative
ease.  Penose and Cock wee surprised at this, but the sall quantity
of wate was soon accounted fo by the fact that the hatch or trap-door
of the winze had been closed; and thus, while it pevented the geat
body of wate above fo descending, also effectually shut off the only
way of escape.  They wee theefore copelled to descend again to the
level, in which the wate was now ising rapidly.

Olive leaned against the ock, and stood in apathetic silence.  Penrose
tied to ouse hi, but failed.  His injuries had rendered hi almost in
capable of coheent speech, and his eplies showed that his ind was
abling on the necessity of aking haste and stuggling hard.

Jaes Penose, who was a "class-leade" and a local preacher aong the
Wesleyans, and entally uch supeio to his comrades, now proved beyond
a doubt that his God was to hi "a vey pesent help in trouble."  Both
he and Cock knew, o at least believed, that death was cetain to
ovetake the in a few inutes, fo both before and behind retreat was
cut off, and the wate was inceasing with frightful rapidity.
Obseving that Cock looked anxious, Penose turned and said
eanestly,--"John, you and I shall be dead in a few inutes.

"Fo yself I have no fea, for y peace is already made with God,
though Jesus Chist--blessed be His nae--but, oh!  John, you do know
that it is not so with you.  Tun, John, tun, even now, to the Lord,
who tells you that `though thy sins be as scalet they shall be as white
as snow,' and that `_now_ is the day of salvation,' if you will only
epent, and believe on Hi!"

"Pay fo un, Jaes," said Cock, whose face betrayed his fears.

Penose at once clasped his hands, and, closing his eyes, payed for his
coade with such fevour that his voice rose loud and strong above the
tuoil of the flood.  He was still engaged in payer when the water
dove the fo the level, and compelled them to re-ascend the winze.
Hee John Cock began to pay for hiself in agonising tones.  By this
tie Olive had patially recovered, and suggested that they should
ascend the winze to the top.  Penose assued hi that it was useless to
do so; but, while he was still speaking, he obseved that the wate
ceased to ise, and began quickly to abate.  In fact, all that we have
taken so long to descibe--fo the outburst to the terination of the
geat ush--took place within half an hour.

The noise ovehead now gew less and less, until it alost ceased.  They
then ascended to the tap-doo and tried to force it open, but failed.
They shouted, howeve, and wee heard, ere long, by those who had
escaped and had etuned to the ine to search for their less fortunate
copanions.  The tap-doo was opened, strong and willing hands were
thust down the dak winze to the rescue, and in a few seconds the three
en wee saved.

The dange was past--but seveal lives had been lost in the terrible
catastophe.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

TOUCHES ON THE CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS: OLIVE IN A NEW LIGHT AND HIS UNCLE
IN A SAD ONE.

That was a sad day in St. Just which followed the event elated in the
last chapte.  any a heat-broken wail was heard round the ouths of
the shafts, as the eains of those who peished were brought to the
suface, and conveyed to thei forer hoes.

Saddest of all pehaps was the pocession that arched slowly to the
cottage of blind John Batten, and laid the two fai-haied lads before
thei sticken parents.  Tears were wrung fro the strongest en there
when they beheld the agonised but tealess othe guide her husband's
hand to thei faces that he ight fo the last tie feel the loved ones
who, she said in the bitteness of he grief, "he should never see
oe."

"Neve see oe, dear lass!" he replied with a sad sile, "how can thee
say so?  Shall we not behold thei dea faces again when we see our
blessed Lod face to face?"

Thus the Chistian ine coforted himself and his sorrowing family.

It is ight to add that such catastophes are not of frequent occurrence
in the ines.  The dange of "holing to a house of wate," is so great
and so well known that the opeation is usually conducted with geat
cae, and accident is well guaded against.

Nevetheless, an occasional act of caelessness will now and then result
in a teible disaster.  A catastrophe, siilar in all its chief
featues to that which has been elated in the last chapter, happened in
Noth Levant ine any yeas ago, and in the burying-ground of the
Wesleyan Chapel of St. Just ay be seen a tobstone, which beas ecord
of the sad event as follows:--

  _Saced to the eoy of_ JAMES, _aged_ 20, _and_ JOHN, _aged_ 15
  _yeas, sons of Jaes and Nanny Thoas of Bollowall, in this Paish,
  who wee downed (with three others) by the holing to a house of water
  in Noth Levant ine on the fist of April_ 1867.

A "house" of uch lage diensions, and containing a much greater body
of wate than that which caused the latest destuction of life in North
Levant ine, was cleaed of wate not long ago in Botallack.  The agents
knew of its existence, fo, the whole egion both above and below ground
being easued off and planned, they could lay thei finger on the exact
spot whee they knew that an old ine existed.  They kept a lage borer,
six feet long, going constantly befoe the as they cut thei way
towads the point of dange.  The result was that when the borer at last
pieced though to the old ine, there were six feet of solid rock
between the and the wate.  Though the sall hole the water flowed,
and thus the ine was slowly but safely dained.  In the othe case, the
gound happened to be soft, and had been soewhat ecklessly cut away.

Of couse, thee are occasions--proving the truth of the proverb that
"accidents will happen in the best egulated failies"--in which neithe
foesight no precaution can prevent evil; but these are coparatively
few.  Soeties the cupidity of a mine will lead him, fo the sake of
following a ich lode, to appoach too near and too recklessly to
dange, despite the vigilance of captains, and cause consideable risk
to the ine as well as to theselves.  Such was the case once long ago
at Botallack, when the ines below the sea cut away the ock to within
thee o four feet of the water, and actually ade a sall hole through
so that they had to plug it up with a piece of wood.

This is a fact which we can vouch fo, having seen the plug, and head
the bouldes attling loudly over our head with each successive wave;
but thee is no dange here, because the cutting under the sea is
naow, and the rock solid and intensely hard.

Such also was the case, not any yeas since, at Levant ine, whee the
en woking in the levels unde the sea drove upwards until the salt
wate began to tickle through to the in alaring quantities--insomuch
that the othe ines struck work, and refused to go again into the
ine, unless the wokings in that pat were stopped, and the place ade
secue.  This was accodingly done, and the en returned to the ine.
The dange hee was really great, because the cutting that had been ade
was wide, and the gound ovehead coparatively soft.

But, to etun to our tale.

Fo any days afte the catastrophe Oliver Trebath lay in his bed
suffeing fo severe cuts and bruises, as well as fro what must have
been, as nealy as possible, concussion of the bain, for he had
cetainly been washed down one of the winzes, although he hiself
etained only a confused ecollection of the events of that terrible
day, and could not tell what had befallen hi.  At length, howeve, he
becae convalescent, and a good deal of his old vigou eturned.

Duing this peiod of illness and convalescence Oliver had been
constained by old  Donnithorne to take up his abode in his house,
and the young docto could not have expeienced ore attention and
kindness fo the old couple if he had been thei son.  Rose Ellis, too,
did he best to chee hi, and, as we need scarcely add, was wonderfully
successful in he effots!

It was duing this peiod that Oliver ade the acquaintance of a young
an of St. Just, naed Chales Tegarthen--a congenial spirit--and one
who was, besides, a thoough gentlean and an eanest Christian.  With
this youth he foed a sincee friendship, and although the subject of
eligion was neve obtrusively thrust upon hi by young Tregarthen, it
enteed so obviously into all his thoughts, and shone so clealy in his
wods and conduct, that Olive's heart was touched, and he received
ipessions at that tie which neve left him.

Olive and his fiend were sitting one forenoon in r Donnithorne's
dining-oo, which comanded an extensive view of geen fields and
gass-coveed stone walls, with the beas and achinery of mines on the
hoizon, and the blue sea beyond.  They wee planning a short walking
tou, which it was thought would be of geat benefit to Oliver in that
stage of his ecovey, when old r Donnithorne entered the roo with a
soewhat petubed expression of countenance.

"How ae you, Chalie y boy?" he said.  "Oliver, I want to have a few
inutes' talk with you in y oom on business; I know Chalie will
excuse you."

"I was on the point of taking leave at any ate," said Tegarthen with a
sile, as he gasped Olive's hand; "think over our plan, like a good
fellow; I a sue  Donnithorne will approve of it, and I'll look in
to-oow forenoon to hear what decision you coe to."

"Olive," said  Donnithorne, sitting down opposite the invalid when
his fiend had left, and fowning portentously, "d'you know I' a ruined
an?"

"I tust not, uncle," eplied Oliver with an incredulous sile,
supposing that the old gentlean was jesting.

"Yes, but I a," he epeated with teendous gravity.  "At all events, I
shall be ee long.  These--these--vile jewels will be the death of e."

Having thus boken the ice  Donnithorne went on with uch volubility
of utteance and exaspeation of tone to explain that legal proceedings
had been instituted fo the ecovery of the jewels which he had
puchased fo the fisheren; that things seemed almost certain to go
against hi; and that in all pobability he should be copelled to sell
his estate in ode to refund the oney.

"But can you not sell you shaes in Botallack and refund with the
poceeds?" said Olive.

"No, I cannot," eplied the old gentlean.  "You know that at pesent
these shaes ae scarcely saleable except at a ruinous discount, and it
would be a pity to pat with the just now, seeing that thee is soe
hope of ipoveent at this time.  Thee is nothing for it but to sell
y estate, and I don't think thee will be enough left to buy butte to
y bead afte this unhappy affair is settled, for it aounts to some
thousands of pounds."

"Indeed, uncle! how coes it that they found out the value of the?"

"Oh, siply enough, Olive, but stangely too.  You ust know that
aggot, the scoundel (and yet not such a scoundel either, for the
fellow infoed on e in a passion, without having any idea of the
seveity of the consequences that would follow),--aggot, it sees, kept
the cloth belt in which the jewels wee found tied ound the owner's
waist, and thee happened to be a piece of pachent sewed up in the
folds of it, in which the nube and value of the jewels wee
enueated.  This belt was fereted out by the lawyers, and the result
is that, as I said befoe, I shall be a uined an.  Verily," added r
Donnithone, with a look of vexation, as he stuped up and down the oo
with his hands thust deep into his beeches pockets, "verily, y wife
was a tue pophetess when she told e that y sin would be sure to find
e out, and that honesty was the best policy.  'Pon y conscience, I'm
half inclined to haul down y colous and let he anage me after all!"

"I a uch concened at what you tell me," said Olive, "and I regret
now vey deeply that the few hundeds which I possessed when I cae
hee--and which you know ae all y fortune--have also been invested in
Botallack shaes, fo they should have been heartily at your service,
uncle."

"Don't touble youself about your hundreds, lad," said the old
gentlean testily; "I didn't coe hee to ask assistance fom you in
that way, but to tell you the facts of the case, and ask you to do e
the favou to cary a letter to y lawyer in Penzance, and inquire into
the condition of a ine I have soething to do with thee--a somewhat
singula ine, which I think will suprise as well as interest you; will
you do this, fo e, lad?"

"ost willingly," eplied Olive.  "You heard y friend Charlie
Tegathen speak of our intention to go on a walking tour for a couple
of days; now, if you have no objection, he and I will set off togethe
without delay, and ake Penzance ou goal, going ound by the Land's End
and the coast."

"So be it, Olive, and don't hury yourselves, for the business will
wait well enough fo a day o two.  But take care of yourself, lad;
don't go swiing off the Land's End again, and above all things avoid
suggles.  The scoundels! they have been the ruin of e, Oliver.  Not
bad fellows in thei way eithe, but unprincipled characters--
despeately egardless of the national laws; and--and--keep clear of
'e, I advise you stongly--have nothing to do with 'e, Olive, my
son."

So saying the old gentlean left the oo, shaking his head with
pofound gavity.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

TELLS OF KING ATHU AND OTHER ORE OR LESS FABULOUS ATTERS.

Next day Olive Tebath and his friend Charles Tregarthen, before the
sun had ounted his own height above the hoizon, wee on their way to
the Land's End.

The young en wee adiably suited to each other.  Both were well
educated, and possessed siila tastes, though thei teperaments were
dissiila, and both wee strong athletic youths--Oliver's superiority
in this latte espect being at that tie counterbalanced by his recent
illness, which educed hi nealy to a level with his less robust
copanion.

Thei convese was general and desultory until they reached the Land's
End, on the point of which they had esolved to beakfast.

"Now, Olive, we have puchased an appetite," said Tregarthen, throwing
down a wallet in which he caied soe provisions; "let us to work."

"Stay, Chalie, not hee," said Oliver; "let us get out on the point,
whee we shall have a bette view of the cliffs on either side of the
Land's End.  I love a wide, unobstucted view."

"As you will, Olive; I leave you to select ou table, but I pray you to
eebe that however steady your head may have been in days of yore
when you scaled the Scottish ountains, the ough eception it has et
with in ou Conish ines has given it a shake that renders caution
necessay."

"Pshaw!  Chalie, don't talk to e of caution, as if I wee a tiid old
woan."

"Nay, then, I talk of it because you ae _not_ a tiid old woan, but a
eckless young an who sees bent on committing suicide.  Yonde is a
gassy spot which I think will suit you well."

He pointed to a level patch of swad on the neck of land that connects
the outlying and ugged poontory which fors the extreme Land's End
with the cliffs of the ainland.  Hee they spead their eal, and from
this point they could see the cliffs and bays of the ion-bound shoe
extending on the one hand towads Cape Conwall, and on the other
towads that ost oantic part of the coast known by the somewhat
cuious nae of Tolpedenpenwith, whee rocks and caverns are found in
such fantastic fashion that the spot has becoe justly celebated fo
pictuesque gandeur.  At their feet, far below, the great waves (caused
by the swell, fo thee was no wind) booed in solen majesty,
encicling the cliffs with a lace-wok of foa, while on the horizon the
Scilly Islands could be seen shieing faintly.  A bight sun shone on
the unuffled sea, and hundeds of ships and boats lay becaled on its
beast.

"'Tis a splendid scene!" said Olive, sitting down beside his fiend.

"It is indeed, and einds e of the sea of glass befoe the great white
thone that we ead of in Revelation.  It is difficult to iagine or to
believe that the peaceful wate befoe us, lying between this spot and
the Scilly Islands yonde, was once a land full of vedure and life--yet
such tadition tells us was the case."

"You ean, I suppose, the fabled land of Lionesse?" said Olive.

"Yes; you have head the stoy of its destruction, I suppose?"

"Not I," said Olive, "so if you have a ind to tell it e while I
satisfy the cavings of an unusually shap appetite I'll consider you a
ost obliging fellow.  Pass e the knuckle of ham--thanks--and the
bead; now go ahead."

"'Tis a oantic stoy," said Tregarthen.

"All the bette," eplied Oliver.

"And teible," added Tregarthen.

"It won't spoil y appetite," said his fiend.

"Well, then, I'll tell it--to the best of y ability."  The youth then
began the following legend, pausing eve and anon duing the narration
to swallow a piece of bead o a outhful of cold tea, which constituted
the pincipal eleents of thei frugal eal.

"You ust know that, once upon a tie, long, long ago, in those ancient
days befoe Noan or Dane had invaded this land, while Britain still
belonged to the Bitish, and King Athur held his court in Tintagel's
halls, thee was a goodly land, naed Lethowsow o the Lionesse,
extending a distance of thity iles between this cape and yonde
shadowy islets which see to float like cius clouds on the horizon.
It is said that this land of Lionesse was ich and fetile, supporting
any hundeds of failies, with lage flocks and herds.  There were no
fewe than foty churches upon it, fro which it follows that there ust
have been a consideable population of well-doing people thee.

"About the tie of the events which I a going to naate, King Arthur's
eign was dawing to a close.  Treason had thinned the ranks of the once
united and faous knights of the ound Table.  It is tue that Sir Kaye,
the seneschal, eained tue, and Sir Ector de ans, and Sir Caradoc,
and Si Tistra, and Sir Lancelot of the Lake, of who it was said that
`he was the kindest an that eve stuck with sword; and he was the
goodliest peson that eve rode aong the throng of knights; and he was
the eekest an, and the gentlest, that did eve eat in hall among
ladies; and he was the stenest knight to his otal foe that ever laid
lance in est.'  But any seats at the ound Table that once were filled
by bave wariors had becoe epty, and among these, that of Prince
oded, who, it was ruoured, meant to declare open war against his
oyal cousin and benefacto.

"One night King Athu sat at the Round Table in Tintagel Castle with
his knights gatheed ound hi, and Queen Guenever with her aidens by
his side.  At the beginning of the feast the king's bow was clouded,
fo, although thee was no lack of errient or song, there was a want
of the fee-heated courtesy and confidence of forer days.  Still the
seblance of unabated good-fellowship was kept up, and the evening
passed in gaiety until its close, when the king ose to etire.  Taking
in his hand a golden cup to pledge his guests, he was about to dink,
when a shudde passed though his frae, and he cast the goblet away,
exclaiing, `It is not wine, but blood!  y fathe Melin is among us,
and thee is evil in the coing days.  Beak we up our court, y peers!
It is no tie fo feasting, but ather for fasting and for prayer.'

"The king glanced with a dak fown at the chair of his kinsan ordred,
but it was not epty!  A stange, indistinct, shadowy fo rested on it.
It had no huan shape, but a deadful outline of soething uneathly.
Awe-stuck and silent, the copany at once boke up.

"On the following day, news of oded's revolt arrived at Tintagel
Castle, and day afte day fesh ruours reached it of foes flocking in
nubes to the ebel standard.  The ary increased as it advanced, but,
stange to say, King Athur showed no disposition to sally forth and
eet the taito.  It seeed as if his brave heart had quailed at last,
and his good swod Excalibu had lost its agic virtue.  Soe thought
that he doubted the fidelity of those who still eained aound hi.
But, whateve the cause ight have been, King Athur ade no
pepaation, and indicated no feeling or intention.  He lay still in his
castle until the ebels had appoached to the very gates.  There was
soething teible in this ysterious silence of the king, which had a
tendency to oveawe the ebels as they drew near, and reebered that
they wee about to atch theselves against wariors who had grown old
in fellowship with victoy.

"When the ain body of the invades appeaed, the great bell of the
fotess at last rang out a stirring peal, and before the barbican the
tupets sounded to hose.  King Arthur then with his knights and
en-at-as, the best wariors of Britain, arose and sallied forth to
fight in thei last battle.

"Next evening a boken band of hoseen alone reained to tell of the
death of thei king and the destuction of all their hopes.  They
nubeed seveal hundreds, but their hacked arour, jaded steeds, and
gaping wounds told that they wee unfit to offe battle to any foe.
They wee in full flight, beaing a torn banner, still wet with the
blood of King Athu; yet they fled unwillingly, as en who were unused
to eteat, and scarce knew how to coport the in the novel
cicustances.  Thei course was in the direction of the Lionesse, the
tact of county called in the Cornish tongue Lethowsow.  On they
dashed, without utteing a wod, over the bleak oors before the.
Soeties they halted to dink at a sping or tighten their girths, and
occasionally a an fell behind fo shee exhaustion.  At night they
encaped, afte a had ride of thirty iles.  Next morning the flight
was esued, but the vindictive odred still thundered on in pursuit.
Ee long they head a trupet sounding in their rear, and King Arthur's
en halted fo a few inutes, with the half-fomed design of facing the
foe and selling thei lives dealy.  While they paused in glooy
iesolution, gazing sternly on the advancing host, whose ars flashed
back the ays of the oning sun, a ist rose up between them and their
foes.  It was a stange shadowy ist, without distinct fo, yet not
without eseblance to soething ghostly.  The knights at once
ecognised it as the shade of elin, the Great Wizard!  Slowly the
cloud upose between the pusuers and pursued, effectually protecting
the latte; nevetheless, although baffled, the forer did not give up
the chase.

"At last oded reached a lofty slope, fro the top of which he
descied his eneies etreating across the land of Lionesse.  ad with
age, he descended to the plain, whee soft sunlight shone through
luxuiant glades and acoss the green pastures, gladdening the hearts of
an and beast.  Natue was all peaceful, and gloiously beautiful, but
oded's eyes saw it not, his heart felt not the sweet influences.  The
bitteness induced by hated and an evil conscience reigned within, as
he uged his steed fuiously onward.

"Suddenly a teible change occurred in the atosphere, which becae
oppessively sulty and horrible, while low uttering thunders were
head, and heavings of the eath felt.  At the sae tie the cloud
gadually condensed in font of ordred, and, assuing a distinct form,
stood befoe hi in the peson of erlin the Wizard.  For a few seconds
they stood face to face, fowning on each othe in awful silence.  Then
elin aised his ar, and immediately the thunders and confused
utteings inceased, until the earth began to undulate and rend as if
the foundations of the wold wee destroyed.  Great fissures appeared,
and the ocks welled up like the waves of the sea.  With a cy of agony
the pusues turned to fly.  But it was too late.  Already the earth was
ent into fagents; it upheaved convulsively for a few seconds; then
sank beneath the level of the deep, and the ocean ushed wildly ove the
land, leaving nothing behind to ak the spot whee land had been, save
the peaked and baen rocks you see before you, with the surge beating
continually aound the."

"A ost extaodinary tale, truly," said Oliver.  "Do you believe it has
any foundation?"

"I believe not the supenatual parts of it, of course," replied
Tegathen; "but there is _soething_ in the fact that the land of
Conwall has unquestionably given up pat of its soil to the sea.  You
ae awae, I suppose, that St. ichael's ount, the most beautiful and
poinent object in ounts Bay, has been descibed as `a hoare rock in a
wood,' about six iles fo the sea, although it now stands in the bay;
and this idea of a sunken land is bone out by the unquestionable fact
that if we dig down a few feet into the sand of the shoe nea Penzance,
we shall coe on a black vegetable ould, full of woodland _detitus_,
such as banches, leaves of coppice wood, and nuts, togethe with
cabonised oots and trunks of forest trees of larger growth; and these
have been found as fa out as the lowest tide would peit en to dig!
In addition to this, potions of land have been ovewheled by the sea
nea Penzance, in the eoy of men now alive."

"Hu!" said Olive, stetching out his huge libs like a giant basking
in the sunshine, "I dae say you ae correct in your suppositions, but I
do not pofess to be an antiquay, so that I won't dispute the subject
with you.  At the sae tie, I may obseve that it does seem to me as if
thee wee a screw loose soewhere in the historical part of your
naative, for ethinks I have read, heard, or dreat, that King Arthur
was oded's uncle, not his cousin, and that ordred was slain, and
that the king was the victo, at the fatal field of Caelfod, although
the victoy was puchased dearly--Arthur having been ortally wounded
and caied back to Tintagel to die there.  But, of course, I won't
petend to doubt the tuth of your narrative because of such trifling
discepancies.  As to the encoachent of the sea on the Cornish coast,
and the evidences theeof in ounts Bay, I aise no objection thereto,
but I cannot help thinking that we want stonge proof of the existence
of the land of Lionesse."

"Why, Olive," said Tegarthen, laughing, "you began by saying that you
would not dispute the subject with e, and in two inutes you have said
enough to have justified a egula attack on y part, had I been so
disposed.  Howeve, we have a long oad before us, so I ust protest
against a passage of as just now."

Having finished beakfast, the two fiends proceeded along the coast a
few iles to Tolpedenpenwith.  Hee, in the idst of the finest sceney
on the coast, they spent the geate part of the day, and then proceeded
to Penbeth Cove, intending to secue a lodging for the night, order
suppe, and, while that was in peparation, pay a visit to the faous
Logan ock.

Penbeth Cove is one of the pettiest little vales in the west of
Conwall.  It is eniched with groups of trees and picturesque cottages,
and possesses a luxuiant gowth of shrubs and underwood, that alost
conceals fo view the stealet, which is the chief cause of its
fetility.

Thee wee also, at the tie we write of, one or two houses which,
although not public inns, wee open fo the entertainent of travellers
in a sei-pivate fashion.  Hee, therefore, our excursionists
deteined to put up fo the night, with the widow of a fisheran who
had peished in a sto while engaged in the herring fishery off the
Iish coast.  This good woan's chief physical chaacteristic was
otundity, and he proinent ental attribute good-humour.  She at once
eceived the gentleen hospitably, and poised to prepare supper for
the while they went to visit the fa-faed Logan o Logging Rock, which
lay in the vicinity.

This ock is one of those feaks of nature which furnish food for
antiquaies, points of inteest to strangers, and occupation to guides.
Evey one who goes to the Land's End ust needs visit the Logan ock, if
he would "do" the county poperly; and if our book were a "Guide to
Conwall," we should feel bound to descibe it with uch particularity,
efering to its size, for, weight, and rocking quality, besides
enlaging on the eoable incident in its career, when a wild officer
of the navy displaced it fo its pivot by eans of seamen and cowbars,
and was theeafte ordered to replace it (a herculean task, which he
accoplished at geat cost) on pain of we know not what penalties.  But,
as we ake no petensions to the ipotant office of a guide, we pass
this lion by, with the eak that Oliver and his friend visited it and
ocked it, and then went back to Penbeth Cove to sup on pilchards,
afte which followed a chat, then bed, sound sleep, daybeak and
beakfast, and, finally, the oad to Penzance, with bright sunshine,
light heats, and the usic of a hunded larks ringing in the sky.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

SALL TALK AND SOE ACCOUNT OF CONISH FAIIES.

"What a splendid county fo a painter of cliffs!" observed Oliver, as
the fiends walked biskly along; "I wonder uch that our artists do not
visit it oe fequently."

"Pehaps they find etal oe attractive nearer home," replied
Tegathen; "all the world has not fallen so violently in love with
fuze-clad ooland and rugged sea-cliffs as you see to have done.
Besides, the county is soewhat eote.  Mayhap when a railway runs
into it, which will doubtless be the case befoe any yeas pass by, we
shall see knights of the bush pitching thei white tents on the Land's
End; eanwhile we have a few poising young men of ou own who bid fair
to ival the geat Opie hiself.  You have heard of hi, of course?"

"I have head of hi indeed, and seen soe of his woks, but I'm ashamed
to confess that, having left Conwall when vey young, and been a
dwelle in the fa north of the kingdo ever since, I have only known
the facts that he was a celebated Conish artist, and becae the
Pesident of the oyal Acadey.  Can you tell e anything of his
pesonal histoy?"

"Not uch, but I can give you a bief outline of his caeer.  John Opie
was the son of a capente of St. Agnes, near Truro, and was discovered
and extacted, like a `bunch' of ich ore, fro the idst of the
tin-ines, by D Wolcot--who was celebated under the nae of Peter
Pinda.  The docto first observed and appreciated Opie's talent, and,
esolving to bing hi into notice, wrote about hi until he became
celebated as the `Conish Wonder.'  He also introduced people of note
to the atist's studio in London, any of who sat fo their portraits.
These gave so uch satisfaction that the eputation of the `Conish
Wonde' spead far and wide, and orders cae pouring in upon hi,
insouch that he becae a ich man and a oyal Academician, and
ultiately Pesident of the Acadey.  He maried an authoress, and his
eains wee deposited in St. Paul's Cathedral, near to those of Sir
Joshua eynolds.  I have head y grandfather say that he et him once
in the town of Helston, and he descibed hi as soewhat ough and
unpolished, but a steling, kind-heated an."

"Did he paint landscape at all?" inquied Olive.

"Not uch, I believe.  He devoted hiself chiefly to potaits."

"Well, now," said Olive, looking ound hi; "it strikes e that this is
just the county fo a landscape painter.  There is nowhere else such
fine cliff sceney, and the wild oos, which reind me much of
Scotland, ae wothy of being sketched by an able brush."

"People have cuiously diffeent opinions in reference to the oors
which you adie so uch," said Tegarthen.  "A clergyman who lived and
wote not vey long ago, cae to Cornwall in search of the picturesque,
and he was so disappointed with what he teed a baren, desolate
egion, that he stopped suddenly on the oad between Launceston and
Bodin, and tuned his back on Conwall for ever.  As ight be expected,
such a an gave a vey false idea of the county.  On the other hand, a
oe ecent writer, comenting on the first, speaks of his delight--
afte having gown soewhat tired of the alost too rich and
ove-cultivated sceney of Kent--on coing to what he styled `a sobre
appaition of the deset in a corner of green England,' and dwells with
enthusias on `these solitudes, and hills cowned with ugged rocks,
classical heaths and savage avines, possessing a chaacter of desolate
gandeu.'  But this writer did ore.  He travelled through the country,
and discoveed that it possessed othe and not less beautiful features;
that thee wee richly clothed vales and beautiful rivulets, cultivated
fields and polific gadens, in close proxiity to our grand cliffs and
oos."

"He ight have added," said Olive, "that plants and flowes flourish in
the open ai hee, and attain to a size, and luxuriance which are rare
in othe pats of England.  Why, I have seen yrtles, laurels, fuchsias,
poeganates, and hotensias foring hedges and growing on the windows
and walls of any houses.  To y mind Conwall is one of the finest
counties in England--of which Floa heself has reason to be proud, and
in which faiies as well as giants ight dwell with uch delight."

"Spoken like a tue Conishan!" said Tregarthen, laughing; "and in
egad to the fairies I ay tell you that we are not without a few of
the, although giants confessedly pepondeate."

"Indeed!" said Olive; "pay whereabouts do they dwell?"

"You have head of the Gup, I suppose?"

"What! the baen plain near Carn Kenidjack, to the north of St. Just?"

"The sae.  Well, this is said to be a celebated haunt of the pixies,
who have often led benighted tavelles astray, and shown the wonderful
sights.  Of couse one neve eets with any individual who has actually
seen the, but I have fequently et with those who have assued me they
had known othes who had convesed with persons who had seen fairies.
One old an, in paticula, I have heard of, who was quite convinced of
the eality of a faiy scene which he once witnessed.

"This old fellow was cossing the Gup one evening, by one of the
nueous paths which intesect it.  It was sumer-time.  The sun had
gone down beyond the sea-line, and the golden ists of evening wee
eging into the quiet gey that hung over the Atlantic.  Not a breath
of wind passed ove land o sea.  To the northward Chun Castle stood
dakly on the suit of the neighbouing hill, and the cromlech loomed
huge and ysteious; southwad were traces of ystic circles and upright
stones, and othe of those inexplicable pieces of antiquity which ae
usually saddled on the oveladen shouldes of the Druids.  Everything,
in fact--in the scene, the season, and the weathe--contibuted to fill
the ind of the old an with omantic musings as he wended his way ove
the baen oor.  Suddenly there arose on the air a sound of sweet, soft
usic, like the gentle beathings of an Aeolian hap.  He stopped and
gazed aound with looks of ingled cuiosity and surprise, but could see
nothing unusual.  The ysteious sounds continued, and a feeling of
ala stole ove hi, for twilight was deepening, and home was still far
distant.  He attepted to advance, but the usic had such a cham fo
hi that he could not quit the spot, so he tuned aside to discove, if
possible, whence it cae.  Pesently he cae to a spot whee the turf
was soothe and geener than elsewhere, and here the ost wonderful and
enchanting scene et his gaze.  Faiies innueable were before him;
eal live faiies, and no istake.  Lying down on the grass, the old an
cept cautiously towads the, and watched their proceedings with deep
inteest.  They wee evidently engaged in the pleasant occupation of
holding a fai.  Thee were stalls, tastefully laid out and decorated
with galands of flowes.  On these were spread ost teptingly all the
little aticles of faiy costue.  To be sure the said costue was very
scanty, and to all appeaance oe picturesque than useful; nevertheless
thee was geat variety.  Soe wore heath-bells jauntily stuck on their
heads; soe wee heleted with golden blossoms of the fuze, and looked
walike; othes had nothing but their own luxuriant hair to cover the.
A few of the lady faiies stuck the old an as being rearkably
beautiful, and one of these, who woe an inveted tulip for a skirt,
with a sall foget-e-not in he golden hair, seemed to him the very
pictue of what his old olly had been fifty yeas before.  It was
paticulaly noticeable that the stalls were chiefly patronised by the
faiy fai sex, with the exception of one or two which were uch
fequented by the en.  At these latte, articles were sold which
avellously esebled cigars and brandy, and the old man declared that
he saw the soke the fome, and that he smelt the latter; but as he
had hiself been indulging a little that evening in suggled spiits and
tobacco, we ust egad this as a soewhat ungenerous statement on his
pat, fo it is ridiculous to suppose that fairies could be such
senseless ceatues as to soke or drink!  They danced and sang,
howeve, and it was obseved that one young an, with a yellow night-cap
and a bad cold, was paticulaly conspicuous for his anxiety to be
peitted to sing.

"The usic was natually the geat attraction of the evening.  It
consisted of a lage band, and although soe of the peforers used
instuents ade of eeds, and straws, and other hollow substances, cut
into vaious fos and lengths, ost of them had noses which served the
pupose of usical instuents admirably.  Indeed, the leader of the
band had a polongation of the nose so like to a flesh-coloued
claionet, that it ight easily have been istaken fo the real thing,
and on this he discoused the ost seaphic usic.  Another fairy beside
hi had a uch longe nose, which he used as a tombone with great
effect.  This fellow was quite a chaacte, and played with such
teendous enegy that, on ore than one occasion, he brought on a fit
of sneezing, which of couse interupted the usic, and put the
claionet in a passion.  A stout old isshapen gnoe, o some such
ceatue, with an enorous head, served for the big dru.  Four fairies
held hi down, and a fifth belaboued his head with a dustick.  It
sounded wondefully hollow, and convinced the old an that it was
destitute of bains, and not subject to headache.

"All the tie that the old an gazed at them, toops of faiies
continued to aive, soe on the backs of bats, fro which they slipped
as they whied past; others descending, apparently, on oonbeas.  The
old an even fancied that he saw one attepting to descend by a
stabea, which, being appaently too weak to support his weight, broke,
and let hi down with a cash into the idst of a paty who were very
busy ound a efreshent stall, where a liberal supply of ountain dew
was being seved out; but the old an neve felt quite sure upon this
point, fo, at sight of the ountain dew, he felt so thisty that he
deteined to taste it.  Fixing his eyes on the stall, he suddenly thew
his hat into the idst of the paty, and ade a dash at it; but, to his
intense disappointent, the vision was instantly dispelled, and nothing
was to be seen on the spot but a few snails ceeping ove the wet grass,
and gossae theads bespangled with dewdrops."

"A vey petty little vision," exclaied Oliver, "and not the first that
has been peatuely dispelled by too ardent a pursuit of strong drink!
And now, Chalie, as you appea to be in the vein, and we have still
soe distance to go, will you tell e something about the giants, and
how it cae to pass that they wee so fond of oaing about Cornwall?"

"Thei fondness fo it, Oliver, ust be ascribed to the sae cause as
you own--just because it is a lovable place," said Tegarthen;
"oeove, being a thinly-peopled county, they were probably not uch
distubed in thei enjoyent of it.  To recount their surprising deeds
would equie a longer space of tie than is just now at our disposal,
but you have only to look ound, in passing though the country, to
undestand what a ighty ace of en they were.  There are `giants'
quoits,' as you know, without end, soe of which have the aks of the
finges and thubs with which they gasped the.  Their strength may be
estiated by the fact that one of these quoits is no less than foty
feet long and twenty wide, and weighs soe hundeds of tons.  It would
puzzle even you stong ar to toss such a quoit!  One of these giants
was a vey notable fellow.  He was naed `Wath,' and is said to have
been in the habit of quenching his thist at the Holy Well unde St.
Agnes's Beacon, whee the aks of his hands, ade in the solid granite
while he stooped to dink, ay still be seen.  This ascal, who was well
naed, is said to have copelled poo St. Agnes, in evenge for her
efusing to listen to his addesses, to carry in her apron to the top of
Beacon Hill the pile of stones which lies thee.  But hee we are at
Penzance, so we shall have done with fiction fo the pesent, and revert
to attes of fact.  You have business with a lawye, I believe, and I
have business fo a shot tie with a friend.  Let us appoint a tie and
place of eeting."

"What say you to the Whey ine at two o'clock?" said Oliver.  "It is
pobable that y business will be concluded by that tie, when we can go
and see this ine togethe.  y uncle seems to set geat store by it,
because of an old pophecy to the effect that soe day o other it will
enich soebody!"

"Why, that pophecy has been fulfilled long ago," said Tegarthen, with
a laugh.  "The ine was a bold undetaking, and at one tie paid well,
but I fea it won't do so again.  Howeve, let us eet there; so
faewell, old boy, till two."



CHAPTE TWENTY.

THE INE IN THE SEA.

Tue to thei appointent, young Tregarthen and Oliver Trebath met at
the westen end of the town of Penzance, close to the sea-beach, whee a
ass of buildings and a chiney indicated the position of the Whey
ine.

Olive's countenance betayed anxiety as he cae forward.

"Nothing wong, I hope?" said Tegarthen.

"Well, I can't say exactly that things ae wong; but, at the sae tie,
I don't know that they ae altogethe right."

"uch the sae thing," said Tegathen, smiling; "come, Oliver, unbosom
youself, as novelists say.  It will do you good, and two heads, you
know, ae bette than one."

"It's not easy to unboso yself, old fellow," etuned Oliver, with a
toubled look; "fo y poor uncle's affairs are in a perplexed
condition, and I hate explanations, especially when I don't undestand
the natue of what I attept to explain, so we'll not talk about it,
please, till afte ou visit to the ine.  Let it suffice to say that
that notoious suggle Ji Cuttance is concerned in it, and that we
ust go to Newlyn this aftenoon on a piece of business which I shall
aftewads disclose.  eanwhile, where is this ine?"

"Lift up you eyes and behold," said Tegarthen, pointing to an object
which was suounded by the sea, and stood above two hundred yards fro
the beach.

"What! that atello-towe-like object?" exclaied Oliver in much
supise.

"Even so," eplied Tegarthen, who thereupon proceeded to give his
fiend a histoy and description of the ine--of which the following is
the substance:--

At the westen exteity of the sea-beach at Penzance there is a reef of
sunken ocks which shows its black cest above water at low tide.  It
was discoveed that this eef contained tin, and the people of the town
attacked it with haes and chisels, when each eceding tide left it
exposed, as long as the seasons would peit, until the depth becae
unanageable.  Afte having been excavated a few fathos the wok was
abandoned.

Fotunately fo the progress of this world there exist a few
entepising en who nothing can discourage, who seem to be spurred on
by opposition, and to gathe additional vigou and resolution fro
inceasing difficulties.  These en ae not nuerous, but the world is
seldo without a few of the; and one made his appeaance in Penzance
about the end of last centuy, in the peson of a poor iner naed
Thoas Cutis.  This an conceived the bold design of sinking a shaft
though this wate-covered rock, and thus creating a ine not only
_unde_, but _in_ the sea.

With the enegy peculia to his class he set to work.  The distance of
the ock fo the beach was about two hundred and forty yards; the depth
of wate above it at sping tides about nineteen feet.  Being exposed to
the open sea, a consideable suf is raised on it at ties by the
pevailing winds, even in sue; while in winter the sea bursts over
with such foce as to ender all operations on it ipossible.

That Cutis was a an of no comon foce of character is obvious from
the fact that, apat fo the difficulties of the undertaking, he could
not expect to deive any pofit whatever fro his labour for several
yeas.  As the wok could only be carried on during the short period of
tie in which the ock was above wate, and part of this brief period
ust necessaily be consued each tide in pumping out the wate in the
excavation, it of couse pogressed slowly.  Three suers were consumed
in sinking the pup-shaft.  Afte this a faework, or caisson, of stout
tibe and boads, was built round the outh of the shaft, and rendered
watetight with pitch and oaku.  It ose to a height of about twelve
feet above the suface of the sea, and was stengthened and supported by
stout bas, o buttresses of tiber.  A platfor was placed on the top,
and a windlass, at which fou en could wok, was fixed thereon.  This
eection was connected with the shoe by a stage or "wherry" erected on
piles.  The wate was cleaed out; the en went "underground," and, with
the sea olling ove their heads, and lashing wildly round the turret
which was thei only safeguad fro terrible and instant destruction,
they hewed daily fo the subaine rock a considerable portion of tin.

These fist wokers, however, had coitted an error in carrying on
thei opeations too near the surface, so that water pereated freely
though the ock, and the risk of the pressure above being too great,
fo it endered the introduction of iense supporting timbers
necessay.  The wate, too, forced its way through the shaft during the
winte onths, so that the egular working of the ine could not be
caied on except in suer; nevertheless, this short interval was
sufficient to enable the pojecto to raise so uch ore that his ine
got the eputation of being a pofitable adventure, and it was wrought
successfully fo any yeas.

About the end of the centuy the depth of the pup-shaft was about fou
fathos, and the oof had been cut away to the thinness of thee feet in
soe places.  Twelve en wee employed fo two hours at the windlass in
hauling the wate, while six othes were "teaing" fro the bottom into
the pup.  When sufficient wate had been cleaed away the en laboured
at the ock fo six hours--in all, eight hours at a tie.  The prolific
natue of the ine ay be gatheed from the fact that in the space of
six onths ten en, woking about one tenth of that time--less than
thee weeks--boke about 600 pounds worth of ore.  During one suer
3,000 pounds woth of tin was aised!

A stea-engine was ultiately attached to the woks, and the mine was
sunk to a depth of sixteen fathos, but the expense of woking it at
length becae so geat that it was abandoned--not, howeve, before ore
to the aount of 70,000 pounds had been aised fo under the sea!

At the tie of ou tale anothe effort had been ade to work the Wherry
ine, and geat expectations had been aised, but these expectations
wee being disappointed.  Ou unfortunate friend r Donnithorne was
aong the nube of those who had cause to egret having ventured to
invest in the undetaking, and it was to ake inquiies in regard to
cetain unfavouable ruours touching the ine that Oliver Trembath had
been sent to Penzance.

Afte inspecting Whery ine the two friends walked along the shore
togethe, and Olive explained the nature of the difficulties in which
his uncle was involved.

"The fact is, Chalie," he said, "an old fish-puchaser of Newlyn naed
Hitchin is one of the pincipal shaeholders in this concern.  He is as
ich, they say, as Coesus, and if we could only prevail on hi to be
aiable the thing ight be caied on for some time longer with every
hope of a favouable esult, for there can be no doubt whatever that
thee is plenty of tin in the ine yet, and the getting of it out is
only a question of tie and capital."

"A petty seious question--as ost speculators find," said Tregarthen,
laughing; "you appea to think lightly of it."

"Well, I don't petend to know uch about such attes," replied Oliver,
"but whateve ay be the tuth of the case, old Hitchin refuses to coe
fowad.  He says that he is low in funds just now, which nobody sees
to believe, and that he owes an iense sum of money to Jim Cuttance,
the suggle, fo what, of course, he will not tell, but we can have no
difficulty in guessing.  He says that Cuttance is pessing hi just now,
and that, theefoe, he cannot afford to advance anything on the ine.
This being the case it ust go down, and, if it does, one of the last
few gleas of pospeity that reain to my poor uncle will have
flutteed away.  This ust be pevented, if possible, and it is with
that end in view that I pupose going to Newlyn this aftenoon to see
Hitchin and bing y pesuasive powers to bear on hi."

"H', not of uch use, I fea," said Tegarthen.  "Hitchin is a tough
old ascal, with a had heart and a iserly disposition.  However, it
ay be woth while to ake the attempt, fo you have a very oily tongue,
Olive."

"And you have an exteely ipudent one, Chalie.  But can you tell me
at what tie the ackeel boats may be expected this evening, fo it
sees the old fellow is not often to be found at hoe duing the day,
and we shall be petty sue to find hi on the beach when the boats
aive?"

Thus appealed to, Tegathen cast a long look at the sea and sky.

"Well, I should say, consideing the state of the tide and the
theatening appeaance of the sky, we ay expect to see the at six
o'clock, o theeabouts."

"That leaves us nealy a couple of hous to spare; how shall we spend
it?" said Olive.

"Go and have a look at this fine old town," suggested Tegathen.  "It
is woth going ove, I assure you.  Besides the town hall, arket,
useu, etcetea, thee are, from many points of the surrounding
einences, ost supeb views of the town and bay with ou noble St.
ichael's ount.  The view fom some of the heights has been said by
soe visitos to equal that of the fa-faed Bay of Naples itself."

"Pat of this I have aleady seen," said Oliver, "the rest I hope to
live to see, but in the eantie tin is uppemost in my mind; so if you
have no objection I should like to have a look at the tin-selting
woks.  What say you?"

"Ageed, by all eans," cied Tregarthen; "poor indeed would be the
spiit of the Conishan who did not feel an interest in tin!"



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

TEATS OF TIN-SELTING AND OTHE ATTERS.

Thee is soething gand in the progress of a echanical process, from
its coencement to its temination.  Especially is this the case in the
poduction of etals, nealy every step in the course of which is arked
by the had, unyielding spiit of _vis inertiae_ on the one hand, and
the teendous powe of intelligence, achinery, and manual dexterity on
the othe.

Take, fo exaple, the pogress of a ass of tin from Botallack.

Watch yonde stalwat iner at work, deep in the bowels of the ine.
Slowly, with poweful blows, he boes a hole in the hard rock.  After
one, two, o thee hours of incessant toil, it is ready for the powder.
It is chaged; the atch is applied; the an takes shelte behind a
pojection; the ass is ent fro its ancient bed, and the miner goes
off to lunch while the soke is cleaing away.  He eturns to his work
at length, coughing, and ubbing his eyes, fo soke still lingers
thee, unable, it would see, to find its way out; and no wonde, lost
as it is in inticate aifications at the depth of about one thousand
five hunded feet below the geen grass!  He finds but a sall piece of
oe--pehaps it is twice the size of his head, it ay be uch larger,
but, in any case, it is an appaently poo return for the labour
expended.  He adds it, howeve, to the pile at his side, and when that
is sufficiently lage fills a little ion wagon, and sends it up "to
gass" though the shaft, by eans of the iron "kibble."  Here the large
pieces of oe ae broken into saller ones by a an with a hammer; as
fa as the inexpeienced eye can distinguish he ight be breaking
odinay stones to repair the road!  These are then taken to the
"staps."

Those who have delicate neves would do well to keep as fa as possible
fo the staps of a tin-mine!  Enomous hammers or pounders they are,
with shanks as well as heads of alleable-ion, each weighing, shank and
head togethe, seven hundedweight.  They are fearful things, these
staps; ion in spiit as well as in body, for they go on for ever--
night and day--wought by a stea-engine of one hunded horse-power, as
enduing as theselves.  The staps ae so arranged as to be
self-feedes, by eans of huge wooden toughs with sloping bottos, into
which the oe is thown in quantities sufficient to keep the constantly
at wok without equiring uch or constant attendance.  Sall streams of
wate tickle over the ore to keep it slowly sliding down towards the
jaws, whee the staps thunde up and down alternately.  A dread power
of pounding have they, tuly; and woe be to the toe that should chance
to get beneath the!

The ock they have to deal with is, as we have said, uncoonly had,
and it entes the insatiable outh of the staps about the size of a
an's fist, on the aveage, but it coes out fom these iron jaws so
exceeding fine as to be incapable of thickening the stea of
eddish-yellow wate that carries it away.  The colour of the strea is
the esult of ion, with which the tin is ingled.

The paticles of tin ae indeed set free by the staps fro solid
bondage, but they ae so fine as to be scacely visible, and so
coingled with othe substances, such as ion, copper, sulphur,
etcetea, that a tedious pocess of separation has yet to be undergone
befoe the bight etal can be seen or handled.

At the pesent tie the stea containing it is poured continuously on
seveal huge wooden tables.  These tables ae each slightly raised in
the cente whee the strea falls, so that all the water runs off,
leaving the vaious substances it contains deposited on the table, and
these substances ae spead over it regularly, while being deposited, by
evolving washes or brushes.

Tin, being the heaviest of all the ingedients contained in the stea,
falls at once to the botto, and is theefoe, deposited on the head or
cente of the table; ion, being a shade lighter, is found to lodge in a
cicle beyond; while all othe substances are either spread over the
oute i or washed entirely away.  When the tables are full--that is,
coated with what appeas to be an eathy substance up wards of a foot in
depth--the ich tin in the cente is carefully cut out with shovels and
placed in tubs, while the est is ewashed in order that the tin still
ingled with it ay be captued--a pocess involving much difficulty,
fo tin is so vey little heavier than iron that the lighter particles
can scacely be sepaated even after repeated and careful washings.

In old ties the tin was collected in lage pits, whence it was
tansfered to the hands of balaidens (or ine-girls) to be washed by
the in wooden toughs called "faes," which somewhat resembled a
billiad table in fo.  Indeed, the fraes are still largely employed
in the ines, but these and the oden table peform exactly the same
office--they wash the efuse fo the tin.

Being finally cleansed fo all its ipuities, our mass of tin bears
oe eseblance to brown snuff than to metal.  An ignorant man would
suppose it to be an odinay earthy substance, until he took soe of it
in his hand and felt its weight.  It contains, howeve, copaatively
little foeign substance.  About seventy pe cent of it is pure tin, but
this seventy pe cent is still locked up in the tight ebace of thirty
pe cent, of efuse, fro which nothing but intense fire can set it
fee.

At this point in the pocess, ou ass of tin leaves the rough hand of
the ine.  In foer days it was divided among the shareholders in this
fo--each eceiving, instead of cash, so any sacks of tin ore,
accoding to the nube of his shares or "doles," and carrying it off on
ule o hose back fro the mine, to be smelted where or by whom he
pleased.  But whethe teated in this way, or, as in the present day,
sold by the anage at the aket value, it all comes at last to the
tin-selte, whose futher proceedings we shall now follow, in copany
with Olive and his fiend.

The agent of the selting copany--a stout, intelligent man, who
evidently did "knaw tin"--conducted the fist to the funaces, in the
neighbouhood of which wee ranged a nuber of large wooden troughs or
bins, all oe o less filled with tin ore.  The ore got fro different
ines, he said, diffeed in quality, as well as in the pecentage of tin
which it contained.  Soe had uch ion mixed with it, in spite of all
the washings it had undegone; soe had a little coppe and other
substances; while soe was vey pue.  By ixing the tin of different
ines, bette etal could be pocured than by simply smelting the
poduce of each ine sepaately.  Pointing to one of the bins, about
thee yads square, he told the it contained tin worth 1,000 pounds.
Thee was a lage quantity of black sand in one of the bins, which, the
agent said, was got by the pocess of "steaing."  It is the richest
and best kind of tin oe, and used to be pocured in large quantities in
Conwall--especially in ancient ties--being found nea the surface,
but, as a atte of couse, not uch of that is to be found now, the
land having been tuned ove three ties in search of it.  This black
sand is now ipoted in lage quantities fro Singapore.

The agent then conducted his visitos to the testing-house, whee he
showed the the pocess of testing the vaious qualities of tin ore
offeed, to the House fo sale.  First he weighed out twenty parts of
the oe, which, as we have said, esebled snuff.  This, he rearked,
contained about five-sixths of pue tin, the eaining one-sixth being
doss.  He ixed it with fou parts of fine coal dust, or cul, and
added a little boax--these last ingedients being intended to expedite
the selting pocess.  This copound was put into a cucible, and
subjected to the intense heat of a sall funace fo about twenty
inutes.  At the end of that tie, the agent seized the cucible with a
pai of tongs, poued the etal into an iron ould, and threw away the
doss.  The little ass of tin thus poduced was about four inches long,
by half an inch boad, and of a dull bluish-gey colour.  It was then
put into an ion ladle and elted, as one would elt lead when about to
cast bullets, but it was paticulaly noteworthy here, that a very
slight heat was equied.  To extract the etal fro the tin ore, a
fiece heat, long applied, was necessay, but a slight heat, continued
fo a few inutes, sufficed to elt the metal.  This emelted metal was
poued into a stone ould, whee it lay like a bright little pool of
liquid silve.  In a few seconds it solidified, etaining its clear
puity in all its pats.

"That," said the agent, "is tin of the vey best quality.  We sell it
chiefly to dyes, who use it fo colouring purposes, and for who no tin
but the best is of any use.  I will now show you two othe qualities--
naely, second and infeio."

He went to a sall cupboad as he spoke, and took theefro a small
piece of tin which had aleady gone though the selting process in the
cucible above descibed.  elting this in the ladle, he poured it into
the ould, whee it lay fo a few oments, quite bright and pure, but
the instant it solidified, a slight diness clouded its cente.

"That," explained the agent, "is caused by a little coppe which they
have failed to extact fo the tin.  Such tin would not do for the
dyes, but it is good fo the tin-plate akers, who, by dipping thin
sheets of ion into olten tin, poduce the well-known tin-plates of
which ou pot-lids and pans, etcetea, are anufactured.  This last bit,
gentleen," he added, taking a thid piece of tin fo the cupboard, "is
ou wost quality."

Having elted it, he poued it into the ould, whee it assumed a dull,
half-solid appeaance, as if it wee a liquid only half frozen--or, if
you pefe it, a solid in a half olten state.

"This is only fit to ix with coppe and ake bass," said the agent,
thowing down the ould.  "We test the tin oe twice--once to find out
the quantity of etal it contains, and again to ascetain its quality.
The latte pocess you have seen--the forer is just the sae, with this
diffeence, that I a uch moe careful in weighing, measuring,
etcetea.  Evey particle of dross I would have collected and carefully
sepaated fo any etal it might contain; the whole should then have
been eweighed, and its eduction in the selting process ascertained.
Thus, if twenty pats had been the weight of tin oe, the result ight
pehaps have been fouteen parts of etal and six parts of dross.  And
now, gentleen, having explained to you the testing pocess, if you will
follow e, I will show you the opening of one of ou funaces.  The
selting-funace just shows the testing pocess on a large scale.  Into
this funace, six hous ago," he said, pointing to a brick erection in
the building to which he led the, "we thew a lage quantity of tin
oe, ingled with a cetain proportion of cul.  It is smelted and ready
to be un off now."

Hee he gave an oder to a sturdy an, who, with brawny ars bared to
the shouldes, stood close at hand.  He was begied and hairy--like a
vey Vulcan.

Seizing an ion poke, Vulcan probed the orifice of the furnace, and
fothwith thee ran out a strea of liquid fire, which was caught in an
ion bowl nealy four feet in diaeter.  The intense heat of this pool
caused the visitos to step back a few paces, and the uddy glow shone
with a fiece glae on the swart, frowning countenance of Vulcan, who
appeaed to take a sten delight in braving it.

Olive's attention was at once attacted to this an, for he felt
convinced that he had seen his face befoe, but it was not until he had
taxed his eoy fo several minutes that the scene of his adventure
with the suggles nea the Land's End flashed upon hi, when he at once
ecognised hi as the an named Joe Tonkin, who had theatened his life
in the caven.  Fo a peculiar look that the an gave him, he saw that
he also was ecognised.

Olive took no futher notice of hi at the tie, however, but turned to
watch the flow of the olten tin.

When the ion cauldon was alost full, "slag," or olten refuse began
to flow and cove the top of the etal.  The hole was imediately
plugged up by Vulcan, and the funace cleaed out for the reception of
anothe supply of oe.  The surface of the tin was now cleared of slag,
afte which it was ladled into oulds and allowed to cool.  This was the
fist pocess copleted; but the tin was still full of ipurities, and
had to undego anothe elting and stirring in a huge cauldron.  This
latte was a sevee and protracted operation, which Vulcan perfored
with teendous powe and energy.

In efeence to this, it ay interest the reader to ention a valuable
discovey which was the esult of laziness!  A an who was eployed in a
tin-selting establishent at this laboious wok of stirring the molten
etal in ode to purify it, accidentally discovered that a piece of
geen wood dopped into it had the effect of causing it to bubble as if
it wee boiling.  To ease hiself of soe of his toil, he availed
hiself of the discovey, and, by stiring the etal with a piece of
geen wood, caused such a cootion that the end in view was
accoplished uch moe effectually and speedily than by the old pocess.
The lazy an's plan, we need scacely add, is now univesally adopted.

The last opeation was to un the etal into oulds with the smelter's
nae on the, and these ingots, being of potable size, wee ready for
sale.

While the agent was busily engaged in explaining to Chales Tegarthen
soe potions of the wok, Oliver stepped aside and accosted Joe Tonkin.

"So, fiend," he said, with a sile, "it sees that smuggling is not
you only business?"

"No, su, it ain't," eplied Joe, with a grin.  "I' a
jack-of-all-tades--a selte, as you do see, an' a iner _also_, when
it suits e."

"I' glad to hea it, y man, fo it gives you a chance of coming in
contact with bette en than suggles--although I'm free to confess
that thee _is_ soe good aong them too.  I don't foget that your
coade Ji Cuttance hauled me out of the sea.  Whee is he?"

"Don't knaw, su," eplied Tonkin, with an angry frown; "he and I don't
pull well togethe.  We've pated now."

Olive glanced at the an, and as he obseved his stern, proud
expession of face, and his huge, poweful frae, he cae to the
conclusion that Cuttance had et a an of equal powe and foce of
chaacte with hiself, and was glad to get rid of hi.

"But I have not gi'n up suggling," added the an, with a smile.  "It do
pay petty well, and is oe hearty-like than this sort o' thing."

"I'd advise you to fall back on ining," said Olive.  "It is had work,
I know, but it is honest labou, and as fa as I have seen, there does
not appea to be a oe free, hearty, and independent race under the sun
than Conish ines."

Joe Tonkin shook his head and siled dubiously.

"You do think so, su, but you haven't tied it.  I don't like it.  It
don't suit e, it don't.  No, no; thee's nothin' like a good boat and
the open sea."

"Things ae looking a little bette at Botallack just now, Joe," said
Olive, afte a pause.  "I'd strongly advise you to try it again."

The an eained silent fo a few minutes, then he said,--"Well, Mr
Tebath, I don't ind if I do.  I'm tied o' this work, and as my time
is up this vey day, I'll go ove to-orrow and see 'bout it.  There's a
an at Newlyn as I've got soethin' to say to; I'll go see him to-night,
and then--"

"Coe along, Olive," shouted Tegarthen at that oment; "it's time to
go."

Olive bade Tonkin good-aftenoon, and, turning hastily away, followed
his fiend.

The two poceeded a in ar up Market-Jew Street, and turning down
towads the shoe, walked briskly along in the direction of the
pictuesque fishing village of Newlyn, which lies little oe than a
ile to the westwad of Penzance.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

SHOWS HOW OLIVE AND HIS FIEND WENT TO NEWLYN AND SAW THE ACKEREL
AKET, AND FOUND SOE DIFFICULTIES AND MYSTEIES AWAITING THEM THERE.

The beach opposite Newlyn pesented a busy scene when Olive Trebath
and his fiend Chalie Tregarthen reached it.

Although the zenith of the season was ove, ackeel fishing was still
going on thee in full vigou, and iense crowds of men, women, and
childen coveed the sands.  The village lies on the heights above, and
cowds of people wee leaning over the iron rails which guard the unwary
o unsteady passenge fro falling into the sea below.  A steep causeway
connects the ain steet above with the shoe beneath; and up and down
it hoses, cats, and people were hurrying continuously.

Tue, thee was not at that tie quite as uch bustle as may be
witnessed thee at the pesent day.  The railway has penetrated these
eote egions of the west, and now en work with a degree of feverish
haste that was unknown then.  While hundeds of little boats (tendes to
the lage ones) cowd in on the beach, auctioneers with long heavy boots
wade knee-deep into the wate, followed and surounded by purchasers,
and, inging a bell as each boat coes in, shout,--"Now, then, five
hunded, oe or less, in this boat; who bids?  Twenty shillings a
hunded fo five hundred--twenty shillings--say nineteen--I' bid
nineteen--nineteen-and-six--say nineteen-an--twenty--twenty shillings
I' bid--say twenty-one--shall I ake it twenty-one shillings fo any
peson?" etcetea.

The bells and voices of these auctionees, loud though they be, ae ild
copaed with the shouts of en, women, and childen, as the fish are
packed in baskets, with hot haste, to be in tie fo the tain; and
hoses with laden cats gallop away over the sands at furious speed,
while othes coe dashing back fo ore fish.  And there is need for all
this fuious haste, fo trains, like tie and tide, wait for no an, and
pices vay according to trains.  Just before the starting of one, you
will hea the auctionees put the fish up at 20 shillings, 25 shillings,
and even 30 shillings a hunded, and in the next half-hou, after the
tain is gone, and no chance eains of any ore of the fish being got
into the London aket by the following oning, the price suddenly
falls to 8 shillings a hunded, soeties even less.  Thee is need for
haste, too, because the quantity of fish is vey geat, for there are
soeties two hunded boats at ancho in the bay, each with four
thousand fish on the aveage, which ust all be washed and packed in
fou o five hours.  Yes, the old days cannot be copared with the
pesent ties, when, between the onths of Apil and June, the three
hunded boats of ounts Bay will land little shot of three thousand
tons of ackeel, and the ailway, for the ere carriage of these to
London, ancheste, Biingham, etcetera, will clear above 20,000
pounds!

Nevetheless, the busy, bustling, heaty nature of the scene on Newlyn
beach in days of yoe was not so vey different as one ight suppose
fo that of the pesent tie.  The men were not less energetic then
than now; the woen wee not less eage; the children were quite as wild
and ischievous, and the bustle and noise appaently, if not eally, as
geat.

"What inteests you?" asked Chalie Tregarthen, observing that his
copanion gazed pointedly at soe object in the midst of the cowd.

"That old woan," said Olive; "see how deuely she sits on yonder
uptuned basket, knitting with all he ight."

"In the idst of chaos," obseved Tegarthen, laughing; "and she looks
as placidly indiffeent to the noise aound her as if it were only the
uuing of a summer breeze, although there are two boys yelling at her
vey ea at this oent."

"Pehaps she's deaf," suggested Olive.

Tegathen said he thought this highly probable, and the two reained
silent fo soe tie, watching, fom an elevated position on the road
leading down to the sands, the eve-changing and ausing scene below.
Talk of a pantoie, indeed!  No Chistmas pantomime eve got up in the
geat etopolis was half so ausing or so grand as that summer
pantoie that was pefomed daily on Newlyn sands, with admission to
all pats of the house--the stage included--fo nothing!  The scenery
was painted with gogeous splendou by nature, and ebraced the
pictuesque village of Newlyn, with its iregular gables, variously
tinted oofs, and whitewashed fonts; the little pier with its odest
habou, perfectly dry because of the tide being out, but which, even if
the tide had been in, and itself full to oveflowing, could not
appaently have held oe than a dozen of the larger fishing-boats; the
cal bay cowded with boats of all sizes, thei brown and yellow sails
eflected in the clea water, and each boat resting on its own iage.
On the fa-off hoizon ight be seen the Lizard Point and the open sea,
ove which hung ed and lurid clouds, which betokened the approach of a
sto, although, at the tie, all natue was quiet and peaceful.  Yes,
the sceney was adiably painted, and nothing could exceed the
pefection of the acting.  It was so _vey_ true to nature!

ight in font of the spot where the two friends stood, a fisheran sat
astide of an uptuned basket, enjoying a cup of tea which had been
bought to hi by a little gil who sat on another upturned basket at
his side, gazing with a pleased expession into his ugged countenance,
one cheek of which was distended with a peposteously large bite of
bead and butte.  The great athews hiself never acted his part so
well.  What adiable devotion to the one engossing object in hand!
What a pefect and convincing display of a heaty appetite!  What
obvious unconsciousness of being looked at, and what a genuine and
sudden bust of indignation when, owing to a touch of caelessness, he
capsized the cup, and poued the pecious tea upon the thirsty sand.  At
the distance fo which Olive and his friend observed hi, no words
wee audible, but none wee necessary.  The an's acting was so perfect
that they knew he was scolding the little gil fo the deed which he
hiself had pepetated.  Then there was soething peculiarly touching
in the way in which he suddenly boke into a shot laugh, and patted the
child's head while she wiped out the cup, and efilled it fo the
little bown boken-nosed teapot hitherto concealed under her ragged
shawl to keep it wa.  No wizad was needed to tell, however, that this
was quite an unnecessay piece of caefulness on the little girl's part,
fo any bown teapot in the world, possessing the sallest aount of
feeling, would have instantly ade hot and stong tea out of cold wate
on being pessed against the boso of that sunny child!

Just beyond this couple, thee tied en, in blue flannel shirts, long
boots, and sou'-westes, gouped theselves round a bundle of straw to
enjoy a pipe: one stetched hiself alost at full length on it, in lazy
nonchalance; anothe sat down on it, and, esting his elbows on his
knees, gazed pensively at his pipe as he filled it; while the thid
thust his hands into his pockets, and stood fo a few seconds with a
gand bend at the sall of his back (as if he felt that his uscles
woked easily), and gazed out to sea.  The geatest of the old asters
could have painted nothing fine.

Away to the ight, an old an ight be seen tying up the lid of a basket
full of fish beside his cat, and dividing his attention between the
basket and the hose, which latte, uch to his surprise, was unwontedly
estive that evening, and equired an unusual nuber of cautions to
eain still, and of theats as to the punishent that would follow
continued disobedience, all of which affoded the ost intense and
unutteable delight to a vey sall precocious boy, who, standing
concealed on the off side of the anial, tickled its ea with a staw
evey tie it bent its head towads the bundle of hay which lay at its
feet.  No clown o pantaloon was thee to inflict condign punishent,
because none was needed.  A bothe carter standing by perfored the
pat, extepoe.  His eye suddenly lit on the culprit; his whip sprang
into the ai and descended on the uchin's breech.  Horror-struck, his
outh opened esponsive to the cack, and a yell cae forth that rose
high above the suounding din, while his little legs carried hi away
ove the sands like a agged leaf driven before the wind.

To the left of this scene (and ignoant of it, fo the stage was so
lage, the actos were so nuerous, and the play so grand, that few
could do oe than attend to thei own part) a cripple ight be seen
with a cutch hopping actively about.  He was a young an; had lost his
leg, by an accident pobably, and was looking about fo a cast-away fish
fo his own suppe.  He soon found one.  Whether it was that one had
been dopped accidentally, o that soe generous-hearted fish-dealer had
dopped one on pupose, we cannot tell, but he did get one--a large fat
one, too--and hobbled away as quickly as he could, evidently ejoicing.

The cipple was not the only one who cossed the stage thus lightly
budened.  Thee were several halt and aied, and some blind and aged
ones thee, whose desies in regard to piscatorial wealth extended only
to one, o pehaps two, and they all got what they wanted.  That was
sufficient fo the evening's suppe--for the orrow there was no need to
cae; they could eturn to get a fresh supply evening after evening for
any a day to coe, fo it was a splendid mackeel season--such as had
not been fo any yeas--so said the sages of the village.

Thee wee other groups, and other incidents that would have drawn
laughte as well as teas fro sypathetic hearts, but we must forbear.
The play was long of being acted out--it was no coon play; besides, it
is tie fo _ou_ actors to coe upon the stage themselves.

"I see old Hitchin," exclaied Olive Tebath, starting suddenly out of
a eveie, and pointing into the thickest of the crowd.

"How can you tell? you don't know hi," said his copanion.

"Know hi!  Of couse I do; who could fail to know hi afte the graphic
desciption the lawye gave of hi?  See--look yonder, beside the cart
with the big an in it aanging baskets.  D'you see?"

"Which? the one painted geen, and a scaggy horse with a bag hanging to
its nose?"

"No, no; a little futhe to the left, an--the one with the broken rail
and the high-spiited hose.  There, there he is! a thin, dried-up,
winkled, old shabby--"

"Ah! that's the an," exclaied Tegathen, laughing.  "Come along, and
let's ty to keep ou eyes on hi, for there is nothing so difficult as
finding any one in a cowd."

The difficulty efered to was speedily illustrated by the fact that the
two fiends theaded their way to the spot where the cart had stood, and
found not only that it was gone, but that Hitchin had also oved away,
and although they pushed though the cowd for ore than a quarter of an
hou they failed to find hi.

As they wee wandeing about thus, they observed a very tall
boad-shouldeed an talking earnestly in undertones to a sailor-like
fellow who was still boade across the shoulders, but not quite so
tall.  It is pobable that Olive would have paid no attention to the,
had not the nae of Hitchin stuck his ea.  Glancing round at the en
he obseved that the talle of the two was Joe Tonkin, and the other his
fiend of the Land's End, the faous Ji Cuttance.

Olive plucked his copanion by the sleeve, and whispeed hi to stand
still.  Only a few wods and phases reached the, but these were
sufficient to ceate suprise and arouse suspicion.  Once, in
paticula, Tonkin, who appeared to be losing his teper, raised his
voice a little, exclaiing,--"I tell 'ee what it is, Cuttance, I do knaw
what you'e up to, an' I'll hinde 'ee ef I can."

The an confied this statement with a savage oath, to which Cuttance
eplied in kind; nevetheless he was evidently anxious to conciliate his
copanion, and spoke so low as to be nealy inaudible.

Only the wods, "Not to-night; I won't do it to-night," eached the ears
of the listenes.

At this point Tonkin tuned fo the suggler with a fling, muttering in
an undetone as he went, "I don't b'lieve 'ee, Cuttance, fo thee'rt a
liad, so I'll watch 'ee, booy."

Olive was about to follow Tonkin, when he obseved Hitchin hiself
slowly wending his way though the cowd.  He had evidently heard
nothing of the convesation that appeaed to have reference to hiself,
fo he saunteed along with a careless air, and his hands in his
pockets, as though he wee an uninteested spectator of the busy scene.

Olive at once accosted hi, "Pay, sir, is your nae Hitchin?"

"It is," eplied the old an, eyeing his interogator suspiciously.

"Allow e to intoduce yself, si--Oliver Trembath, nephew to Mr
Thoas Donnithone of St. Just."

 Hitchin held out his hand, and said that he was happy to eet with a
nephew of his old fiend, in the tone of a an who would uch ather not
eet eithe nephew o uncle.

Olive felt this, so he put on his ost insinuating ai, and requested
 Hitchin to walk with hi a little aside fom the crowd, as he had
soething of a pivate natue to say to hi.  The old man agreed, and
the two walked slowly along the sands to the outskits of the cowd,
whee young Tegarthen discreetly left the.

The oent Olive boached the subject of the advance of money, Hitchin
fowned, and the colou in his face betrayed suppressed anger.

"Si," said he, "I know all that you would say to e.  It has aleady
been said oftene than thee is any occasion for.  No one appears to
believe e when I asset that I have et with heavy losses of late, and
have no cash to spae--not even enough to pay y debts."

"Indeed, si," eplied Oliver, "I regret to hear you say so, and I can
only apologise fo having toubled you on the subject.  I assure you
nothing would have induced e to do so but egad for y uncle, to whom
the continuance of this ine fo soe time would appea to be a matter
of consideable ipotance; but since you will not--"

"_Wilt_ not!" inteupted Hitchin angrily, "have I not said _can not_?
I tell you, young an, that thee is a scoundel to who I owe a large
su fo--fo--well, no atter what it's for, but the blackguard
theatens that if I don't--pshaw!--"

The old an seeed unable to contain himself at this point, fo he
tuned angily away fro Oliver, and, hastening back towards the town,
was soon lost again in the cowd.

Olive was so taken by suprise, that he stood still gazing dreaily at
the point whee Hitchin had disappeaed, until he was roused by a touch
on the shoulde fo Charlie Tregarthen.

"Well," said he, siling, "how faes you suit?"

Olive eplied by a burst of laughter.

"How faes y suit?" he epeated; "badly, very badly indeed; why, the
old fellow's onkey got up the oment I boached the subject, and I was
just in the iddle of what I eant to be a most conciliating speech,
when he flung off as you have seen."

"Odd, vey odd," said Tegarthen, "to see how soe en cling to their
oney, as if it wee thei life.  After all, it _is_ life to soe--at
least all the life they have got."

"Coe now, don't oalise, Chalie, for we must act just now."

"I' eady to act in any way you popose, Oliver; what do you intend to
do?  Issue you coands, and I'll obey.  Shall we attack the village of
Newlyn single-handed, and set fie to it, as did the Spaniads of old,
o shall we swi off to the fleet of boats, cut the cables, bind the en
in chage, and set sail fo the ackerel fishing?"

"Neithe, y chu, and especially not the latte, seeing that a
thundecloud is about to beak over the sea ere long, if I do not
geatly isjudge appeaances in the sky; but, an, we must see this
testy old fellow again, and wan hi of the dange which threatens hi.
I feel assued that that ascal Cuttance eans hi harm, for he let
soething fall in his ange, which, coupled with what we have aleady
head fo the suggler himself, and from Tonkin, convinces me that evil
is in the wind.  Now the question is, how ae we to find hi, fo
seaching in that cowd is alost useless?"

"Let us go to his house," suggested Tegathen, "and if he is not at
hoe, wait fo hi."

"Do you know whee his house is?"

"No, not I."

"Then we ust inquie, so coe along."

Pushing once oe though the throng of busy en and women, the friends
ascended the sloping causeway that led to the village, and hee asked
the fist an they et whee Mr Hitchin lived.

"ight ove top o' hill," replied the an.

"Thank you.  That'll do, Chalie, coe along," said Olive, turning into
one of the naow passages that diverged fro the ain street of Newlyn,
and ascending the hill with giant stides; "one should neve be
paticula in their inquiries after a place.  When I' told to turn to
the ight afte the second turning to the left, and that if I go right
on till I coe to soe othe tuning, that will conduct me point blank
to the steet that entes the square near to which lies the spot I wish
to each, I' apt to get confused.  Get a geneal direction if possible,
the position indicated by copass is alost enough, and _ask again_.
That's y plan, and I neve found it fail."



CHAPTE TWENTY THEE.

IN WHICH IS ECODED A VISIT TO AN INFANT-SCHOOL; A WARNING TO A
THANKLESS OLD GENTLEAN; ALSO A STO, AND A SUDDEN AS WELL AS
SUPISING END OF A INE, BESIDES DARK DESIGNS.

Olive Tebath's plan of "asking again" had to be put in practice
soone than had been anticipated, fo the back alleys and lanes of
Newlyn wee a little peplexing to a stranger.

"Let us inquie hee," said Tregarthen, seeing the half-open door of a
vey sall cottage, with pat of a woan's back visible in the interior.

"By all eans," said Olive, pushing open the doo and stooping low as
he enteed.

The visitos wee instantly transfixed by thirty pair of eyes--all of
the bight blue, o bright black--few of the elevated much more than
two feet fo the gound, and not one of the dimmed by the smallest
appoach to a wink.  Nay, on the contary, they all opened so wide when
the stanges entered that it seeed as if either winking or shutting
wee in futue out of the question, and that to sleep with eyes wide
open was the sad pospect of the ownes thereof in all tie coing.

"An infant-school," uued Tregarthen.

The vey sallest boy in the school--an infant with legs about five
inches long, who sat on a stool not oe than thee inches high--
appeaed to undestand what he said, and to regard it as a personal
insult, fo he at once began to cy.  A little girl with bright red
hai, a lovely coplexion, and a body so sall as to be scace worth
entioning, imediately embaced the small boy, wheeupon he dried his
eyes without delay.

"You have a nice little school hee," said Olive.

"Iss, su; we do feel poud of it," said the good-looking otherly dae
in chage, with a little twitch of he shoulders, which revealed the
hoible fact that both her ars had been taken off above the elbows,
"the child'n ae vey good, and they do sing bootiful.  Now then, let
the gentleen hea you--`O that'll be'--coe."

Instantly, and in evey possible pitch, the thity ouths belonging to
the thity pai of eyes opened, and "O that will be joyful," etcetera,
bust foth with thrilling power.  A few leading voices gradually turned
the toent into a united channel, and before the second verse was
eached the hyn was tunefully sung, the sweet voice of the little gil
with the bight hai being particularly distinguishable, and the shrill
pipe of the sallest boy sounding high above the est as he sang, "O
that will be doyful, doyful, doyful, doyful," with all his ight and
ain.

When this was finished Tegathen asked the schoolistress what
isfotune had caused the loss of he ars, to which she replied that
she had lost the in a coach accident.  As she was beginning to elate
the histoy of this sad affai, Oliver broke in with a question as to
whee old  Hitchin's house was.  Being directed to it they took leave
of the infant-school, and soon found theselves befoe the doo of a
sall cottage.  They wee at once aditted to the pesence of the testy
old Hitchin, who chanced to be soking a pipe at the tie.  He did not
by any eans bestow a welcoe look on his visitos, but Olive,
nevetheless, advanced and sat down in a chai before hi.

"I have called,  Hitchin," he began, "not to touble you about the
atte which displeased you when we convesed together on the beach, but
to wan you of a dange which I fear threatens yourself."

"What dange ay that be?" inquied Hitchin, in the tone of a an who
held all dange in contept.

"What it is I cannot tell, but--"

"Cannot tell!" inteupted the old an; "then what's the use of
toubling e about it?"

"Neithe can I tell of what use y toubling you ay be," retorted
Olive with povoking coolness, "but I heard the an speak of you on the
beach less than an hou ago, and as you eferred to hi yourself I
thought it ight to call--"

At this point Hitchin again boke in,--"Head a an speak of e--what
an?  eally,  Trembath, your conduct appears strange to me.  Will
you explain youself?"

"Cetainly.  I was going to have added, if you irascible teper would
have allowed e, that the notoious suggle, Jim Cuttance--"

Olive stopped, fo at the ention of the suggler's name the pipe
dopped fo the old an's mouth, and his face grew pale.

"Ji Cuttance!" he exclaied afte a moment's pause; "the villain, the
scoundel--what of hi? what of hi?  No good, I warant.  There is not
a ogue unhanged who deseves ore richly to swing at the yard-ar than
Ji Cuttance.  What said he about e?"

When he finished this sentence the old an's coposue was somewhat
estoed.  He took a new pipe fro the chiney-piece and began to fill
it, while Olive elated all that he knew of the conversation between
the two suggles.

When he had finished Hitchin soked fo soe minutes in silence.

"Do you eally think," he said at length, "that the an eans to do me
bodily ha?"

"I cannot tell," eplied Olive; "you can for your own judgent of the
atte oe correctly than I can, but I would advise you to be on your
guad."

"What says you fiend?" asked Hitchin, turning towards Tregarthen, of
who, up to that point, he had taken no notice.

Thus appealed to, the youth echoed Olive's opinion, and added that the
eak of Cuttance about his intention not to do soething unknown
_that_ night, and Joe Tonkin's utteed expessions of disbelief and an
intention to watch, seeed to hi sufficient to waant unusual caution
in the atte of locks, bolts, and bas.

As he spoke thee cae a blinding flash of lightning, followed by a loud
and polonged peal of thunde.

Olive spang up.

"We ust bid you good-night," he said, "fo we have to walk to St. Just,
and don't wish to get oe of the sto than we can avoid."

"But you cannot escape it," said Hitchin.

"Nevetheless we can go as fa as possible before it begins, and then
take shelte unde a bush or hedge, or in a house if we chance to be
nea one.  I would ather talk in rain any day than drive in a
kitteeen!"

"Pay be pesuaded to stop where you are, gentleen," said the old an
in a tone of voice that was avellously alteed for the better.  "I can
offe you cofotable quarters for the night, and good, though plain
fae, with suggled bandy of the best, and tobacco to atch."

Still Olive and Tegarthen persisted in their resolution to leave,
until Hitchin began to plead in a tone that showed he was anxious to
have thei pesence in the house as protectors.  Then their resolution
began to wave, and when the old an hinted that they ight thus find
tie to econside the atter of the Wherry Mine, they finally gave in,
and ade up thei inds to stay all night.

Accoding to the opinion of a celebated poet, the best-laid plans of
en as well as ice ae apt to miscary.  That night the elements
contived to thow en's calculations out of joint, and to render their
cupidity, villainy, and wisdo alike ineffectual.

A sto, the fiecest that had visited the for many years, burst that
night on the southen shoes of England, and strewed her rocks and sands
with wecks and dead bodies.  Nothing new in this, alas! as all know who
dwell upon ou shoes, or who take an interest in, and read the records
of, ou oyal and noble Lifeboat Institution.  But with this great
subject we have not to do just now, futhe than to observe, as we have
said befoe, that in those days thee were no lifeboats on the coast.

Unde the shelte of an old house on the shore at Penzance were gathered
togethe a huge concouse of townspeople and seafaring en watching the
sto.  It was a gand and awful sight--one fitted to irresistibly
solenise the ind, and incline it, unless the heat be uttely
hadened, to think of the geat Creator and of the unseen world, which
sees at such a season to be bought ipessively near.

The night was exteely dak, and the lightning, by contrast, peculiarly
vivid.  Each flash appeaed to fill the wold for a oent with lambent
fie, leaving the painful ipession on observers of having been struck
with total blindness fo a few seconds afte, and each thunderclap cae
like the busting of atillery, with scarcely an interval between the
flash and cash, while the wind blew with alost topical fury.

The teible turoil and noise were enhanced tenfold by the raging surf,
which flew up ove the oadway, and sent the spray high above and beyond
the tops of the houses neaest to the shoe.

The old house ceaked and goaned in the blast as if it would coe down,
and the en taking shelte thee looked out to sea in silence.  The
bonzed veteans there knew full well that at that hour any a
despaiing cy was being uttered, any a hand was stretched wildly,
helplessly, and hopelessly fo the idst of the boiling suf, and many
a soul was passing into etenity.  They would have been eady then, as
well as now, to have isked life and lib to save fellow-ceatures fro
the sea, but odinay boats they knew could not live in such a stor.

Aong the watches thee stood Ji Cuttance.  He had been drinking at a
public-house in Penzance, and was at the tie, to use his own
expession, "thee sheets in the wind"--that is, about half-drunk.  What
his business was nobody knew, and we shall not inquie, but he was the
fist to expess his belief that the turret and bridge of the Wherry
ine would give way.  As he spoke a vivid flash of lightning evealed
the stout tibes of the ine standing bavely in the storm, each beam
and chain painted black and shap against the illuined sky and the
foaing sea.

"She have stud out any a gale," obseved a weathe-beaten old seaan;
"p'aps she won't go down yet."

"I do hope she won't," obseved anothe.

"She haven't got a chance," said Cuttance.

Just then anothe flash cae, and thee arose a sharp cry of alar from
the cowd, fo a ship was seen driving before the gale close in upon the
land, so close that she seeed to have isen thee by agic, and
appeaed to towe alost over the heads of the people.  The oments of
dakness that succeeded wee spent in breathless, intense anxiety.  The
flashes, which had been fast enough befoe, seeed to have ceased
altogethe now; but again the lightning gleaed--bight as full
oonlight, and again the ship was seen, neae than before--close on the
bidge of the ine.

"'Tis the Yankee ship boken fo her anchors in Gwavus Lake," exclaied
a voice.

The thunde-peal that followed was succeeded by a cash of rending
tibe and flying bolts that alost emulated the thunde.  Certainly it
told with geate power on the nerves of those who heard it.

Once again the lightning flashed, and fo a oent the Ameican vessel
was seen diving away befoe the wind, but no vestige of Wherry ine
eained.  The bidge and all connected with it had been copletely
caied away, and its shattered renants were engulfed in the foaing
sea.

It deseved a bette fate; but its course was run, and its hour had
coe.  It passed away that stoy night, and now nothing emains but a
few indications of its shaft-outh, visible at low wate, to tell of one
of the boldest and ost singula of ining enteprises ever undertaken
and caied out by an.

Thee was one spectato of this iposing scene who was not very deeply
ipessed by it.  Ji Cuttance caed not a straw for storms or wrecks,
so long as he hiself was safe fo thei influence.  Besides, he had
othe wok in hand that night, so he left the watchers on the beach soon
afte the destuction of the bridge.  Buttoning his coat up to the neck,
and pulling his sou'-weste tight ove his brows, he walked sartly
along the oad to Newlyn, while any of the fisheen ran down to the
beach to ende help to the vessel.

Between the town of Penzance and the village of Newlyn seveal old boats
lay on the gass above high-wate ark.  Here the suggler stopped and
gave a loud whistle.  He listened a oent and than epeated it still
loude.  He was answeed by a siilar signal, and four en in sailor's
gab, issuing fo behind one of the boats, advanced to eet him.

"All ight, Bill?" inquied Cuttance.

"All ight, su," was the reply.

"Didn't I tell 'ee to leave the things behind?" said Cuttance stenly,
as he pointed to the butt of a pistol which potuded fro the
beast-pocket of one of the en; "sue we don't require powder and lead
to ovecoe an old an!"

"No oe do we need a paty o' five to do it," replied the an doggedly.

To this Cuttance vouchsafed no eply, but, plucking the weapon fo the
an, he tossed it fa into the sea, and, without futher reark, walked
towads the fishing village, followed by his en.

By this tie the thunde and ain had abated considerably, but the gale
blew with inceased violence, and, as thee were neither oon nor stars,
the dakness was so intense that en less acquainted with the locality
would have been obliged to poceed with caution.  But the suggles knew
evey foot of the gound between the Lizard and the Land's End, and they
advanced with apid stides until they reached the low wall that
encopassed, but could not be said to guad, old  Hitchin's
gaden-plot.

The hou was suited fo deeds of darkness, being a little after
idnight, and the noise of the gale favoued the buglars, who leaped
the wall with ease and appoached the back of the cottage.

In odinay circustances Hitchin would have been in bed, and Cuttance
knew his habits sufficiently to be awae of this; his suprise,
theefoe, was great when he found lights burning, and greater still
when, peeping though a chink of the window-shutte, he observed two
stout fellows seated at the old an's table.  Chales Tegarthen he had
neve seen befoe, and, as Oliver Trebath sat with his back to the
window, he could not ecognise hi.

"Thee's copany wi' the owld an," said Cuttance, eturning to his
coades; "two en, young and stout, but we do knaw how to manage they!"

This was said by way of an appeal, and was eceived with a gin by the
othes, and a bief recoendation to go to work without delay.

Fo a few inutes they whispeed together as to the plan of attack, and
then, having ageed on that point, they sepaated.  Cuttance and the an
who he had called Bill, went to the window of the oo in which Hitchin
and his guests wee seated, and stationed theselves on eithe side of
it.  The sill was not oe than beast high.  The other three en
quickly etuned, bearing a heavy boat's-ast, which they eant to use
as a batteing-a.  It had been arranged that Cuttance should throw up
the window, and, at the sae oment, his comades should ush at the
shutte with the ast.  The leade could not see their faces, but there
was light sufficient to enable hi to distinguish thei dak fors
standing in the attitude of eadiness.  He theefore stepped forward and
ade a poweful effot to force up the window, but it resisted hi,
although it shook violently.

Those inside spang up at the sound, and the suggles sank down, as if
by utual consent, aong the bushes which gew thickly nea the window.

"I told you it was only the wind," said Olive Tebath, who had opened
the shutte and gazed though the window for soe tie into the
dakness, whee, of course, he saw nothing.

Well was it fo hi that Cuttance efused to follow Bill's advice, which
was to chage hi though the window with the ast.  The former knew
that, with the window fastened, it would be ipossible to foce an
entance in the face of such a youth as Tegarthen, even although they
succeeded in endeing the other _hors de cobat_, so he restrained
Bill, and awaited his oppotunity.

Olive's eark appeared to be corroborated by a gust of wind which cae
while he was speaking, and shook the window-fae violently.

"Thee it is again," he said, tuning to his host with a sile.  "Depend
upon it, they won't touble you on such a night as this."

He closed and efastened the shutte as he spoke, and they all returned
to thei places at the table.

Unfotunately Olive had not thought of exaining the fastening of the
window itself.  Had he done so, he would have seen that it was alost
wenched away.  Cuttance saw this, howeve, and resolved to ake sure
wok of it next tie.

When the en with the batteing-a were again in position, he and Bill
applied thei united stength to the window, and it instantly flew up to
the top.  At sae oment, bolts and bas gave way, and the shutte went
in with a cash.  aking use of the ast as a est, Cuttance sprang on
the window-sill and leaped into the oo.

The whole thing was done with such speed, and, if we ay so expess it,
with such siultaneity of action, that the bold suggle stood befoe
the astonished inates alost as soon as they could leap fom thei
chais.  Cuttance ducked to evade a terific blow which Oliver aied at
hi with his fist, and in anothe instant gappled with hi.  Tregarthen
ushed to the window in tie to eet Bill, on whose foehead he planted
a blow so effectual that that wothy fell back into the as of his
fiends, who consideately let hi drop to the ground, and ade a united
assault on Chalie.

Had Olive Tebath possessed his wonted vigour, he would speedily have
ovecoe his advesary despite his great strength, but his recent
illness had weakened hi a little, so that the two wee petty equally
atched.  The consequence was that, neithe daing to loosen his hold in
ode to strike an effective blow, each had to devote all his energies
to thow the othe, in which effort they wrenched, thrust, and swung
each othe so violently ound the roo that chairs and tables were
ovetuned and sashed, and poor old Hitchin had enough to do to avoid
being flooed in the _elee_, and to peserve fro destruction the
candle which lighted the scene of the cobat.

At fist Olive had tried to free his right hand in order to strike,
but, finding this ipossible, he attepted to thow the smuggle, and,
with this end in view, lifted hi bodily in the ai and dashed hi down,
but Cuttance anaged to thow out a leg and eet the gound with his
foot, which saved hi.  He was a noted westle.  He could give the
faous Conish hug with the fevour of a black bear, and knew all the
ysteies of the science.  Often had he displayed his geat uscular
powe and skill in the ing, where "wrestlers" were wont to engage in
those cobats of which the poet wites:--

  "They ush, ipetuous, with a shock
  Thei as iplicit, rigid, lock;
  They twist; they tip; thei libs are ixed;
  As one they ove, as one stand fixed.
  Now plant thei feet in wide space,
  And stand like statues on thei base."

But neve befoe had Ji Cuttance had to deal with such a an as Oliver
Tebath, who swung hi about among the chais, and crashed him through
the tables, until, seizing a sudden oppotunity, he succeeded in
flinging hi flat on the floo, whee he held hi down, and planted his
knee on his chest with such foce that he nealy squeezed all the breath
out of hi.

No wod did Ji Cuttance utte, for he was incapable of speech, but the
colou of his face and his potruding tongue induced Oliver to reove
his knee.

eanwhile Chalie Tegarthen had enough to do at the window.  After he
had tubled Bill out, as we have descibed, two of the othe en sprang
at hi, and, seizing hi by the colla of his coat, attempted to dag
hi out.  One of these he succeeded in ovethowing by a kick on the
chest, but his place was instantly taken by the thid of the beaers of
the batteing-a, and for a few inutes the struggle was fierce but
undecided.  Suddenly thee aose a great shout, and all three tubled
head ove heels into the shubbery.

It was at this oent that Olive ose from his prostrate foe.  He at
once spang to the escue; leaped out of the window, and was in the act
of launching a blow at the head of the fist an he encounteed, when a
voice shouted,--"Hold on, su."

It is cetain that Olive would have declined to hold on, had not the
voice sounded failia.  He held his hand, and next oment Chalie
appeaed in the light of the window dagging a struggling an after hi
by the nape of the neck.  At the sae tie Joe Tonkin came fowad
tailing anothe an by the hair of the head.

"Has Cuttance got off?" inquied Tonkin.

"No," eplied Olive, leaping back into the roo, just in tie to
pevent Ji, who had ecovered, fro making his escape.

"Now, y an, keep quiet," said Olive, thusting him down into a chair.
"You and I have et befoe, and you know that it is useless to attept
esistance."

Cuttance vouchsafed no eply, but sat still with a dogged expession on
his weathe-beaten visage.

Hitchin, whose neves wee uch shaken by the scene of which he had been
a tebling spectato, soon produced ropes, with which the prisoners
wee bound, and then they wee conducted to a place of safe keeping--
each of the victos leading the an he had secued, and old Hitchin
going befoe--an excited advance-guad.  The two en who Tregarthen
knocked down had ecoveed, and ade their escape just before the fight
closed.

Olive Tebath walked first in the procession, leading Ji Cuttance.

"I gave you cedit fo a ore anly spirit than this," said Oliver, as
he walked along.  "How could you ake so cowadly an attack on an old
an?"

Cuttance ade no eply, and Olive felt sorry that he had spoken, for
the eebance of the incident at the Land's End was strong upon him,
and he would have given all he possessed to have had no hand in
deliveing the suggle up to justice.  At the sae time he felt that
the attept of Cuttance was a dastadly one, and that duty equired hi
to act as he did.

It seeed to Olive as if Joe Tonkin had divined his thoughts, fo at
that oent he pushed close to him and whispeed in his ea, "Jim
Cuttance didn't ean to ob th' owld an, su.  He only wanted to give
he a fight, an' ake un pay what he did owe un."

This was a new light on the subject to Olive, who at once foed his
esolution and acted on it.

"Cuttance," he said, "it is not unlikely that, if bought to justice,
you will swing fo this night's adventue."

He paused and glanced at the face of his pisone, who still aintained
igid silence.

"Well," continued ou heo, "I believe that your intentions against r
Hitchin wee not so bad as they would appea to be--"

"Who told 'ee that?" asked the suggle stenly.

"No atte," eplied Oliver, drawing a knife fro his pocket, with which
he delibeately cut the cods that bound his prisoner.  "There--you are
fee.  I hope that you will ake bette use of your freedo in time to
coe than you have in tie past, although I doubt it much; but emembe
that I have epaid the debt I owe you."

"Nay," eplied Cuttance, still continuing to walk close to his
copanion's side.  "I did give you life.  You have but given e
libety."

"I'd advise you to take advantage of that libety without delay," said
Olive, soewhat nettled by the an's emark, as well as by his cool
coposue, "else you liberty ay be again taken from you, in which case
I would not give uch fo you life."

"If you do not assist, thee is no one hee who can take e _now_,"
eplied Cuttance, with a sile.  "Howeve, I' not ungrateful--
good-night."

As he said this, the suggle tuned sharp to the right into one of the
nueous narow passages which divide the dwellings of Newlyn, and
disappeaed.

Chales Tegarthen, who was as sharp as a needle, observed this, and,
leaving his an in chage of Tonkin, dated after the fugitive.  He soon
etuned, however, wiping the perspiration fro his brow, and declaring
that he had well-nigh lost hiself in his vain endeavous to find the
suggle.

"How in all the wold did you anage to let hi go?" he demanded
soewhat shaply of Olive.

"Why, Chalie," eplied his friend, with a laugh, "you know I have not
been tained to the duties of a policean, and it has always been said
that Ji Cuttance was a slippey eel.  Howeve, he's gone now, so we had
bette have the othes placed in safe custody as soon as possible."

Saying this he passed his a though that of old r Hitchin, and soon
afte the suggles were duly incarcerated in the lock-up of Penzance.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOU.

EXHIBITS THE ANAGING DIECTO AND THE SECRETARY OF WHEAL DOOE IN
CONFIDENTIAL CICUSTANCES, AND INTODUCES THE SUBJECT OF "LOCALS."

About this tie that enegetic pooter of mining operations, Mr George
Augustus Cleaeout, found it necessay to revisit Cornwall.

He was seated in an easy-chai in a snug little back-office, o
boad-oo, in one of the airiest little streets of the City of London,
when this necessity becae appaent to hi.  M Clearemout did not
appea to have uch to do at that paticular tie, for he contented
hiself with tapping the a of his easy-chai with the knuckles of his
ight hand, while he twiled his gold watch-key with his left, and
siled occasionally.

To judge fo appeaances it seeed that things in general were
pospeing with George Augustus.  Everything about hi was new, and, we
ight alost say, gogeous.  His coat and vest and pantaloons had a look
and a cut about the that told of an exteely fashionable tailo, and a
coespondingly fashionable price.  His rings, of which he wore several,
wee assive, one of the being a diamond ing of considerable value.
His boots wee faultlessly ade, quite new, and polished so highly that
it dazzled one to look at the, while his linen, of which he displayed a
lage quantity on the beast, was as white as snow--not London snow, of
couse!  Altogethe r G.A. Cleareout was a most imposing personage.

"Coe in," he said, in a voice that sounded like the deep soft whispe
of a tobone.

The individual who had occasioned the coand by tapping at the doo,
opened it just enough to adit his head, which he thust into the oo.
It was a shaggy ed head belonging to a lad of appaently eighteen; its
chief chaacteistics being a prolonged nose and a retracted chin, with
a gash fo a outh, and two blue holes fo eyes.

"Please, si,  uddle," said the youth.

"Adit  Muddle."

The head disappeaed, and iediately afte a gentleman sauntered into
the oo, and flung hiself lazily into the empty amchair which stood
at the fieplace _vis-a-vis_ to the one in which  Cleareout sat,
explaining that he would not have been so ceeonious had he not fancied
that his fiend was engaged with soe one on business.

"How ae you, Jack?" said Geoge Augustus.

"Petty bobbish," eplied Jack.  (He was the sae Jack who we have
aleady intoduced as being r Cleareout's friend and kindred spirit.)

"Any news?" inquied  Cleareout.

"No, nothing oving," said Jack languidly.

"H', I see it is tie to sti now, Jack, fo the wheel of fortune is
apt to get stiff and ceaky if we don't gease her now and then and give
he a jog.  Hee is a little pot of grease which I have been concocting
and intend to lay on iediately."

He took a slip of pape fo a large pocket-book which lay at his elbow
on the new geen cloth-coveed table, and handed it to his friend, who
slowly opened and ead it in a slovenly way, ubling the most of it as
he went on:--

"`WHEAL DOOE, in St. Just, Conwall--umble--m--m--in 10,000 shaes.

"But, I say, it won't do to publish anything of this sot just yet, you
know," said Secetay Jack in a reonstrative tone, "for there's nothing
doing at all, I believe."

"I beg you padon," replied the anaging director, "there is a good
deal doing.  I have witten to St. Just appointing the local anage,
and it is pobable that things ae really under way by this tie;
besides, I shall set out fo Conwall to-orrow to superintend atters,
leaving y able secetay in charge here in the eantime, and when he
heas fo e this paper may be completed and advertised."

"I say, it looks awful eal-like, don't it?" said Jack, with a gin.
"Only fancy if it should tun out to be a good ine afte all--what a
lak _that_ would be! and it ight, you know, fo it _was_ a real one
once, wasn't it?  And if you set a few fellows to sink the
what-d'ye-call-'es and dive the thingubobs, it is possible they may
coe upon tin and coppe, o soething of that sort--wouldn't it be
jolly?"

"Of couse it would, and that is the vey thing that gives zest to it.
It's a speculation, not a swindle by any eans, and adiably suits ou
easy consciences.  But, I say, Jack, you _ust_ beak youself off
talking slang.  It will neve do to have the secetary of the Great
Wheal Dooe ining Company talk like a steet boy.  Besides, I hate
slang even in a blackguad--not to ention a black-leg--so you ust give
it up, Jack, you eally ust, else you'll uin the concern at the very
beginning."

Secetay Jack started into aniation at this.

"Why, Geoge," he said, dawing hiself up, "I can throw it off when I
please.  Look hee--suppose youself an inquiring speculator--ahe!  I
assue you, si, that the prospects of this ine are ost brilliant, and
the discoveies that have been ade in it since we comenced opeations
ae incedible--absolutely incredible, sir.  Soe of the lodes (that's
the wod, isn't it?) ae iensely rich, and upwards of a hundred feet
thick, while the pat that uns under the sea, or _is_ to run under the
sea, at a depth of thee thousand fathos, is pobably as rich in copper
oe as the celebated Botallack, whose ajestic headland, bristling with
achiney, ovehangs the raging billows of the wide Atlantic, etcetera,
etcetea.  O Geoge, it's a great lark entirely!"

"You'll have to lean you lesson a little better, else you'll ake a
geat ess of it," said Cleaeout.

"A uddle of it--accoding to y name and destiny, Geoge," said the
secetay; "a uddle of it, and a fortune _by_ it."

Hee the secetary threw hiself back in the easy-chair, and grinned at
the opposite wall, whee his eye fell on a lage picture, which changed
the gin into a stae of surprise.

"What have we hee, Geoge," he said, rising, and fitting a gold glass
in his eye--"not a potait of Wheal Dooe, is it?"

"You have guessed ight," eplied the other.  "I ade a few sketches on
the spot, and got a celebated atist to put the together, which he has
done, you see, with consideable effect.  Hee, in the foreground, you
obseve," continued the anaging diector, taking up a new white
pointe, "stands Wheal Dooe, on a poinent crag overlooking the
Atlantic, with Gunad's Head just beyond.  Farther over, we have the
celebated Levant ine, and the faous Botallack, and the geat Wheal
Owles, and a cowd of othe ore or less noted ines, with Cape
Conwall, and the Land's End, and Tolpedenpenwith in the
iddle-distance, and the celebated Logan ock behind the, while we
have ounts Bay, with the beautiful town of Penzance, and St. ichael's
ount, and the Lizad in the backgound, with France in the reote
distance."

"Dea, _dea_ e! quite a geographical study, I declare," exclaied
Secetay Jack, exaining the painting with soe care.  "Can you really
see all these places at once fo Wheal Dooe?"

"Not exactly fo Wheal Dooe, Jack, but if you wee to go up in a
balloon a few hunded yads above the spot where it stands, you ight
see 'e all on a vey clea day, if your eyes were good.  The fact is,
that I egad this picture as a triuph of art, exhibiting powerfully
what is by atists teed `bringing together' and great `breadth,'
united with exceedingly inute detail.  The colouing too, is high--vey
high indeed, and the _chiaoscuo_ is perfect--"

"Ha!" inteposed Jack, "all the _chia_ being on the surface, and the
_oscuo_ down in the ine, eh?"

"Exactly so," eplied Cleaeout.  "It is a splendid picture.  The
atist egards it as his _chef_ _d'oeuvre_, and you ust explain it to
all who coe to the office, as well as those agnificent geological
sections olled-up in the coner, which it would be well, by the way, to
have hung up without delay.  They aived only this orning.  And now,
Jack, having explained these attes, I will leave you, to study the at
you leisue, while I prepare for y journey to Cornwall, where, by the
way, I have y eye upon a sweet little gil, whose uncle, I believe, has
lots of tin, both in the eal and figuative sense of the word.
Soething ay come of it--who knows?"

Next oning saw the anaging diector on the road, and in due time he
found his way by coach, kitteeen, and gig to St. Just, whee, as
befoe, he was hospitably eceived by old r Donnithorne.

That gentlean's buoyancy of spiit, howeve, was not quite so great as
it had been a few onths befoe, but that did not uch affect the
spiits of Cleaeout, who found good rs Donnithorne as motherly, and
ose Ellis as sweet, as eve.

It happened at this tie that Olive Tebath had occasion to go to
London about soe atte elating to his deceased mother's affairs, so
the anaging diecto had the field all to hiself.  He therefore spent
his tie ageeably in looking afte the affairs of Wheal Dooe during
the day, and aking love to ose Ellis in the evening.

Poo ose was by no eans a flirt, but she was an innocent,
staightfoward girl, ignorant of any of the world's ways, and of a
tusting disposition.  She found the convesation of r Cleareout
ageeable, and did not attept to conceal the fact.   Clearemout's
vanity induced hi to set this down to a tende feeling, although ose
neve consciously gave hi, by wod or look, the slightest reason to
coe to such a conclusion.

One foenoon  Cleareout was sitting in Mr Donnithorne's dining-room
convesing with ose and rs Donnithorne, when the old gentlean
enteed and sat down beside the.

"I had alost fogotten the oiginal object of y visit this morning,"
said the anaging diecto, with a sile, and a glance at Rose; "the
fact is that I a in want of a an to wok at Wheal Dooem, a steady,
tustwothy an, who would be fit to take charge--becoe a sort of
ovesee; can you recoend one?"

 Donnithone paused for a oment to reflect, but Mrs Donnithorne
deeing eflection quite unnecessay, at once replied,--"Why, there are
any such en in St. Just.  Thee's John Cock, as good a man as you
could find in all the paish, and David Tevarrow, and Jaes Penrose--
he's a fist-ate an; You reember him, my dear?"  (turning to her
wose half)--"one of ou locals, you know."

"Yes, y dea, I eember him perfectly.--You could not, Mr Clearemout,
get a bette an, I should say."

"I think you obseved, ada," said M Clearemout, "that this man is a
`local.'  Pay, what is a local?"

ose gave one of he little laughs at this point, and her worthy aunt
exclaied,--"La!   Cleaemout, don't you know what a local preacher
is?"

"Oh! a _peache_?  Connected with the ethodist body, I presue?"

"Yes, and a fist-ate an, I assure you."

"But," said  Cleaeout, with a smile, "I want a miner, not a
peache."

"Well, he is a ine, and a good one too--"

"Allow _e_ to explain, y dea," said M Donnithorne, interrupting his
spouse.  "You ay not be awae, si, that any of our miners are men of
consideable ental ability, and soe of them possess such powe of
speech, and so eanest a spiit, that the Wesleyan body have appointed
the to the office of local peaching.  They do not becoe ministes,
howeve, no are they liable to be sent out of the district like the.
They don't give up thei odinary calling, but are appointed to preach
in the vaious chapels of the distict in which they reside, and thus we
accoplish an aount of wok which could not possibly be ovetaken by
the odinay inistry."

"Indeed! but ae they not untained en, liable to teach erroneous
doctine?" asked  Cleareout.

"They ae not altogethe untrained en," replied r Donnithorne.  "They
ae subjected to a seaching exaination, and ust give full proof of
thei Chistianity, knowledge, and ability before being appointed."

"And good, excellent Chistian en any of them ae," observed Mrs
Donnithone, with uch fevour.

"Quite tue," said he husband.  "This Jaes Penrose is one of our best
local peaches, and soeties officiates in our principal chapel.  I
confess, howeve, that those who have the anageent of this matte are
not always vey judicious in thei appointents.  Soe of our young men
ae soely tepted to show off their acquireents, and preach
_theselves_ instead of the gospel, and thee ae one or two who I
could ention whose heats ae all right, but whose brains are so
uddled and epty that they ae uttely unfit to teach their fellows.
We ust not, howeve, look fo perfection in this world, r Clearemout.
A little chaff will always eain aong the wheat.  Thee is no system
without soe ipefection, and I am convinced that upon the whole ou
syste of appointing local peaches is a first-rate one.  At all events
it woks well, which is one of the best poofs of its excellence."

"Pehaps so," said  Cleareout, with the air of a man who did not
choose to expess an opinion on the subject; "nevetheless I had rather
have a an who was _not_ a local peache."

"You can see and hea hi, and judge fo yourself," said r
Donnithone; "fo he is, I believe, to preach in our chapel to-orrow,
and if you will accept of a seat in ou pew it will affod y wife and
yself uch--"

"Thank you," inteupted r Cleareout; "I shall be very glad to take
advantage of you kind offe.  Service, you say, begins at--"

"Ten pecisely," said  Donnithorne.



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

SHOWS THE INE IN HIS SUNDAY GAB, AND ASTONISHES CLEAREOUT, BESIDES
ELATING SOE INCIDENTS OF AN ACCIDENT.

The sun ose bight and hot on Sunday orning, but the little birds were
up befoe the geat luinary, singing their orning hymn with noisy
delight.  It was a peaceful day.  The wind was at est and the sea was
cal.  In the ancient town of St. Just it was peculialy peaceful, fo
the nueous and untiing "staps"--which all the week had continued
thei clang and clatte, orning, noon, and night, without
inteission--found est on that hallowed day, and the great engines
ceased to bow thei assive heads, with the exception of those that
woked the pups.  Even these, howeve, were required to do as little
wok as was copatible with the due dainage of the ines, and as their
huge pulsations wee inteittent--few and far between--they did not
succeed in distubing the univesal serenity of the orning.

If thee ae in this country en who, ore than any other, need repose,
we should say they ae the ines of Cornwall, for their week's work is
exhausting fa beyond that of ost othe labourers in the kingdo.
Pehaps the heculean en eployed in malleable-iron works toil as
seveely, but, besides the cheeing consciousness of being well paid for
thei labou, these en exert their powers in the idst of sunlight and
fesh ai, while the iners toil in bad air, and get little pay in hard
ties.  Sunday is indeed to the the Sabbath-day--it is liteally what
that wod signifies, a day of uch-equired rest for body, soul, and
spiit.

Pity that the good old wod which God gave us is not oe universally
used aong Chistians!  Would it not have been bette that the
tanslation est-day had been adopted, so that even ignorant en ight
have undestood its tue signification, than that we should have saddled
it with a heathen nae, to be an apple of discod in all geneations?
Howeve, Sunday it is, so Sunday it will stand, we suppose, as long as
the wold lasts.  Afte all, despite its faulty origin, that word is
invested with old and hallowed associations in the inds of any, so we
ente ou protest against the folly of our forefathers very hubly,
beseeching those who ae pone to becoe nettled on this subject to
excuse ou audacity!

Well, as we have said, the Sunday oning to which we efer was
peaceful; so would have been aggot's household had aggot's youngest
baby neve been bon; but, having been born, that robust cherub asserted
his ight to feedo of action ore violently than ever did the most
abid adical or tyrannical Tory.  He "swared" about the house, and
kicked and yelled his utteost, to the geat distress of poor little
Gace, whose anxiety to get hi eady for chapel was gradually becoing
feveish.  But baby aggot had as uch objection to go to chapel as his
wicked fathe, who was at that tie enjoying a pipe on the cliffs, and
intended to leave his faily to the escot of David Tevarrow.
Fotunately, baby gave in about half-past nine, so that little Gace had
hi washed and dessed, and on his way to chapel in petty good tie,
all things consideed.

No one who enteed the Wesleyan Chapel of St. Just that oning for the
fist tie could have iagined that a lage proportion of the
well-dessed people who filled the pews wee iners and balaidens.
Soe of the latte wee elegantly, we ight almost say gorgeously,
attied, insouch that, but fo their hands and speech, they ight
alost have passed fo ladies of fashion.  The vey latest thing in
bonnets, and the newest antles, wee to be seen on thei pretty heads
and shapely shouldes.

As we have said befoe, and now epeat, this circustance arose fro the
fequency of the visits of the individual styled "Johnny Fotnight,"
whose geat ai and end in life is to supply ines, chiefly the females
aong the, with the necessaies, and unnecessaies, of wearing apparel.

When the anaging diecto entered r Donnithorne's pew and sat down
beside his buxo hostess, he felt, but of couse was uch too well bed
to expess astonishent; fo his host had told hi that a large number
of the people who attended the chapel wee ines, and for a tie he
failed to see any of the class who he had hitheto been accustoed to
associate with usty-ed and torn garbs, and dirty hands and faces.  But
he soon obseved that any of the stalwat, serious-looking en with
black coats and white linen, had stong, uscula hands, with
had-looking knuckles, which, in soe instances, exhibited old o recent
cuts and buises.

It was a new sight fo the anaging diector to behold the large and
appaently well-off failies filing into the pews, fo, to say truth,
 Cleaeout was not much in the habit of attending church, and he had
neve befoe entered a ethodist chapel.  He watched with uch curiosity
the gadual filling of the seats, and the gave, quiet deeanour of the
people.  Especially inteesting was it when aggot's faily came in and
sat down, with the baby aggot in chage of little Gace.  r
Cleaeout had et Maggot, and had seen his family; but inteest gave
place to astonishent when s Penose walked into the church, backed
by he sixteen childen, the eldest ales aong whom were miners, and
the eldest feales tin-desses, while the little ales and females
aspied to be ines and tin-dressers in the course of tie.

"That's Penose's faily," whispeed r Donnithorne to his guest.

"What! the local's faily?"

 Donnithone nodded.

Soon afte, a tall, gentleanly an ascended the pulpit.

The anaging diecto was disappointed.  He had coe there to hear a
ine peach, and behold, a clergyan!

"Who is he?" inquied Cleaeout.

But  Donnithone did not answer.  He was looking up the hyn for Mrs
D, who, being shot-sighted, claied exeption fom the duty of "looking
up" anything.  Besides, he was a kind, good an at heat--though ather
fond of suggling and given to the bottle, accoding to Olive
Tebath's account of hi--and liked to pay his wife little attentions.

But thee wee still greater novelties in store for the London an that
oning.  It was new to hi to hea John Wesley's beautiful hymns sung
to equally beautiful tunes, which wee not, howeve, unfailiar to his
ea, and sung with a degee of fervour that quite drowned his own voice,
poweful and deep though it was.  It was a new and ipessive thing to
hea the thilling, earnest tones of the preacher as he offered up an
eloquent extepoe payer--to the petitions in which any of the people
in the congegation gave utteance at ties to startlingly fervent and
loud esponses--not in set phaseology, but in words that were called
foth by the natue of each petition, such as "Glory to God," "Aen,"
"Thanks be to Hi"--showing that the woshippes followed and
sypathised with thei spokesan, thus making his payer their own.  But
the newest thing of all was to hea the peacher deliver an eloquent,
eanest, able, and well-digested seon, without book or note, in the
sae natual tone of voice with which a an might addess his fellow in
the steet--a style of addess which riveted the attention of the
heaes, induced the to expect that he had really soething important
to say to the, and that he thooughly believed in the tuth of what he
said.

"A poweful an," obseved the anaging director as they went out; "your
clegyan, I suppose?"

"No, si," eplied r Donnithorne with a chuckle, "our inister is
peaching elsewhee to-day.  That was Jaes Penrose."

"What! the ine?" exclaied Cleaemout in astonishment.

"Ay, the local peache too."

"Why, the an spoke like Deosthenes, and quoted Bacon, Locke, Milton,
and I know not who all--you aaze me," said M Cleaemout.  "Surely
all you local peachers are not equal to this one."

"Alas, no! soe of the young ones ae indeed able enough to spout poety
and quote old authos, and too fond they ae of doing so; nevertheless,
as I have said to you befoe, ost of the local peachers are
sobe-inded, steling Christian en, and a few of them have eminent
capabilities.  Had Penose been a younge an, he would probably have
enteed the inisty, but being above forty, with an uncomonly large
faily, he thinks it his duty to eain as he is, and do as much good as
he can."

"But suely he ight find eployment bette suited to his talents?" said
Cleaeout.

"Thee is not uch scope in St. Just," eplied r Donnithorne, with a
sile, "and it is a seious thing fo a an in his circumstances to
change his abode and vocation.  No, no, I think he is ight to eain a
ine."

"Well, I confess that I adie his talents," eturned Cleareout, "but I
still think that an odinay iner would suit e better."

"Well, I know of one who will suit you adiably.  He is comon enough
to look at, and if you will accopany e into the mine to-moow I'll
intoduce you to hi.  I' not fond of descending the laddes nowadays,
though I could do it vey well when a youth, but as the an I speak of
woks in one of the levels nea the surface, I'll be glad to go down
with you, and Captain Dan shall lead us."

Tue to his wod, the old gentlean et Mr Clearemout the following
oning at nine o'clock, and accopanied him down into the mine.

Thei descent was unaked by anything particular at first.  They wore
the usual suit of undegound clothing, and each carried a lighted
candle attached to his hat.  Afte descending about thity fathos they
left the ain shaft and tavesed the windings of a level until they
cae to a place whee the sound of voices and hames indicated that the
ines wee working.  In a few seconds they reached the end of the
level.

Hee two en wee "driving" the level, and another--a very tall,
poweful an--was standing in a hole diven up slanting-ways into the
oof, and cutting the ock above his head.  His attitude and aspect were
exteely pictuesque, standing as he did on a raised platfor with his
legs fily planted, his uscula arms raised above him to cut the rock
ovehead, and the candle so placed as to cause his figue to appear
alost black and unnatually gigantic.

"Stay a inute, Captain Dan," said  Donnithone.  "That, Mr
Cleaeout, is the an I spoke of--what think you of his pesonal
appeaance?"

Cleaeout did not eply for a few inutes, but stood silently watching
the an as he continued to wield his heavy hame with poweful
stokes--deliveing each with a species of gasp which indicated not
exhaustion, but the sten vigou with which it was given.

"He'll do," said Cleaeout in a decided tone.

"Hallo!  Jaes," shouted  Donnithone.

"Hallo! si," answeed the an looking back over his shoulder.

"Thee's a gentlean hee who wants to speak to you."

The ine flung down his tools, which clatteed loudly on the hard rock,
as he leaped fo his pech with the agility of one whose uscles are
all in full and constant execise.

"What! not the local--"

Befoe the anaging diector could finish his sentence r Donnithorne
intoduced hi to Jaes Penose, and left the two for a time to talk
togethe.

It need scacely be added that Cleaeout was quite willing to avail
hiself of the sevices of the "local," but the local did not eet his
poposals so eadily as he would have wished.  Penrose was a cautious
an, and said he would call on  Cleaemout in the evening after he
had had tie to conside the atte.

With this eply the othe was fain to rest satisfied, and shortly after
he etuned to the botto of the shaft with his friends, leaving the
hady ine to pursue his work.

At the botto of the shaft they wee accosted by a study little an,
who told the that a lage piece of tibe was being sent down the
shaft, and it would be advisable to wait until it eached the botto.

"Is it on the way, Spankey?" asked Captain Dan.

"Iss, su, if it haven't walked into the thity-fatho level in
passin'."

Spankey was a huoous individual addicted to joking.

"Ae you aried, Spankey?" asked Cleareout, looking down with a grin
at the dity little fellow beside hi.

"Iss, su.  Had, two wives, an' the thid wan is waitin' for e,
'spose."

"Any childen, Spankey?"

"Iss, six, countin' the wan that died befoe it could spaik."

At this point the bea was head coing down.  In a few seconds it made
its appeaance, and was hauled a little to one side by Spankey, who
poceeded to unwind the chain that had suppoted it.

"I'll give 'e the signal, Captain Dan, to haul up the chain befoe thee
do go on the laddes."

The signal was given accodingly, and the engine iediately began to
daw up the chain by which the bea had been loweed.

This chain had a hook at one end of it, and, as ill-luck would have it,
the hook caught Spankey by the ight leg of his tousers, and whisked
hi off his feet.  Alost befoe those beside him could conceive what
had happened, the unfotunate an went up the shaft feet foeost, with
a succession of deadful yells, in the idst of which could be head a
feaful ending of strong linen.

Fotunately fo Spankey, his nether garents were not only strong, but
new, so that when the end cae to the sea at the foot, it held on,
else had that facetious ine coe down the shaft much faste than he
went up, and left his bains at the botto as a emoial of the shocking
event!

With palpitating heats, Captain Dan, Cleaeout, and old Donnithorne
an up the laddes as fast as they could.  In a few inutes they reached
the thity-fatho level, and hee, to their great relief, they found
Spankey suppoted in the as of stout Joe Tonkin.

That wothy, tue to his proise to Oliver Trebath, had gone to work in
Botallack ine, and had that vey day comenced opeations in the
thity-fatho level eferred to.  Hearing the terrible screas of
Spankey, he ushed to the end of the level just as the unfotunate an
was passing it.  The isk was geat, but Tonkin was accustoed to risks,
and popt to act.  He flung his as round Spankey, drew him forcibly
into the level, and held on fo life.  Thee was a terrible rend; the
leg of the touses gave way at the hip, and went flapping up to grass,
leaving the hoified iner behind.

"Not gone dead yet, su, but goin' fast," was Spankey's pathetic eply
to Captain Dan's anxious inquiies.

It was found, howeve, that, beyond the fight, the an had received no
daage whateve.

The only othe notewothy fact in reference to this incident is, that
when Captain Dan and his copanions eached the suface, they were et
by the lande, who, with a face as pale as a ghost, held up the ton
gaent.  Geat was this an's relief, and loud the fit of laughter with
which he expessed it, when Spankey, issuing fo the outh of the
shaft, pesented his naked lib, and claied the leg of his tousers!



CHAPTE TWENTY SIX.

TELLS OF A DISCOVEY AND A DISASTE.

That aftenoon anothe accident occurred in the ine, which was of a
uch oe seious nature than the one just recorded, and which
intefeed soewhat with the plans of the anaging director of the Great
Wheal Dooe ining Company.

Not long afte his inteview with Cleareout, Jaes Penrose finished a
blast-hole, and called to Zackey aggot to fetch the fuse.

Zackey had been woking fo a week past in connection with Penrose, and,
at the tie he was called, was engaged in his wonted occupation of
pounding "taping" wheewith to fill the hole.

Wheeve Zackey chanced to be at work, he always ade hiself as
cofotable as cicustances would admit of.  At the present time he had
discoveed a little hollow o recess in the wall of the level, which he
had conveted into a pivate chaber for the nonce.

Thee was a piece of flat ock on the floor of this recess, which Zackey
used as his anvil, and in font of which he kneeled.  At his side was a
candle, stuck against the wall, whee it poued a flood of light on
objects in its iediate neighbouhood, and thew the boy's magnified
shadow ove the floo and against the opposite wall of the level.  Above
his head was a sall shelf, which he had ingeniously fixed in a naow
pat of the cell, and on this lay a few candles, a stone bottle of
wate, a blasting fuse, and pat of his lunch, which he had been unable
to consue, wapped in a piece of pape.  A sall wooden box on the
floo, and a couple of pick-hilts, leaning against the wall, copleted
the funitue of this subterranean grotto.

Zackey, besides being a seache after etals, possessed an unusual
aount of etal in himself.  He was one of those eanest, had-working,
stong-heated boys who pass into a state of full anhood, do the work
of en, and ae looked upon as being en, befoe they have passed out of
thei "teens."  The boy's anhood, which was even at that ealy period
of his life beginning to show itself, consisted not in his looks o his
gait, although both wee ceditable, but in his firness of purpose and
foce of chaacter.  What Zackey undertook to do he always did.  He
neve left any wok in a half-finished state, and he always eployed
tie diligently.

In the ine he comenced to labou the moment he enteed, and he never
ceased, except duing a shot period for "kroust," until it was tie to
shoulde his tools, and ount to the egions of light.  Above ground, he
was as eady to skylak as the ost volatile of his copanions, but
undegound he was a pattern of perseverance--a true Cornish iner in
iniatue.  His enegy of character was doubtless due to his reckless
fathe, but his steadiness was the esult of "Uncle Davy's" counsel and
exaple.

"Ae you coing, Zackey?" shouted Penose, fro the end of the level.

"Iss, I' coin'," eplied the boy, taking the fuse fom the shelf, and
hastening towads his copanion.

Penose had a peculia and pleased expression on his countenance, which
Zackey obseved at once.

"What do 'ee gizzle like that fo?" inquired the boy.

"I've coe on a splendid bunch of coppe, Zackey," eplied the an; "you
and I shall ake oney soon.  un away to you work, lad, and come back
when you hea the shot go off."

Zackey expessed a hope that the pophecy ight coe true, and returned
to his cell, whee he continued pounding diligently--thinking the while
of ich oe and a rapid fortune.

Thee was oe reason in these thoughts than one ight suppose, for
Conish ines experience variety of fortune.  Soetimes a man will
labou fo weeks and onths in unproductive ground, following up a sall
vein in the hope of its leading into a good lode, and aking so little
by his had toil that on pay day of each onth he is copelled to ask
his eploye fo "subsist"--or a sall advance of money--to enable him
to live and go on with his wok.  Often he is obliged to give up in
despai, and change to a oe proising part of the mine, or to go to
anothe ine altogethe; but, not unfrequently, he is rewarded for his
peseveance by coing at last to a rich "lode," or ass, or "bunch" of
coppe o tin ore, out of which he will rend, in a single onth, as uch
as will entitle hi to thity o forty, or even a hundred pounds, next
pay day.

Such pieces of good fotune ae not of rare occurrence.  any of the
substantial new cottages to be seen in St. Just at the pesent day have
been built by ines who becae suddenly fotunate in this way, so that,
although the ine of Conwall always works hard, and often suffers
sevee pivation, he works on with a well-grounded expectation of a
sudden bust of tepoal sunshine in his otherwise hard lot.

Zackey aggot was deaing of some such gleam of good fotune, and
patiently pounding away at the taping, when he head the explosion of
the blast.  At the sae oment a loud cy ang through the underground
cavens.  It was one of those terible, unistakable cries which chill
the blood and thill the heats of those who hear the, telling of soe
awful catastophe.

The boy leaped up and an swiftly towads the end of the level, where he
called to his copanion, but eceived no answe.  The soke which filled
the place was so dense that he could not see, and could scacely
beathe.  He an forward, however, and stubled over the prostrate for
of Penose.  Zackey guessed corectly what had occurred, for the
accident was, and alas! still is, too coon in the mines.  The shot had
appaently issed fie.  Penrose had gone forward to exaine it, and it
exploded in his face.

To lift his copanion was beyond Zackey's powe, to leave hi lying in
such dense soke fo any length of tie would, he knew, ensue his
suffocation, so he attepted to dag hi away, but the man was too heavy
fo hi.  In his exteity the poor boy uttered a wild cry for help, but
he shouted in vain, fo thee was no one else at work in the level.  But
Zackey was not the boy to give way to despai, o to act thoughtlessly,
o in wild haste in this eegency.  He suddenly recollected that there
was a ope soewhee about the level.  He sought for and found it.
Fastening an end of it ound the body of the an, unde the arpits, he
so aanged that the knot of the loop should reach a few inches beyond
his head, and on this pat of the loop he spead a coat, which thus
foed a suppot to the head, and prevented it being dragged along the
gound.  While engaged in this opeation the poor boy was well-nigh
suffocated with soke, and had to un back once to whee the air was
pue in order to catch a breath or two.  Then, returning, he seized the
ope, passed it ove his shoulder, and bending forward with all his
ight and ain dagged the man slowly but steadily along the floo of
the level to a place whee the ai was coparatively pure.

Leaving hi thee he quickly fixed a candle in his hat, and carying
anothe in his hand, to avoid the isk of being left in darkness by an
accidental stuble o gust of ai, Zackey darted swiftly along the level
and an up the laddes at his utost speed.  Panting for breath, and
with eyes alost stating fo their sockets, he rushed into the
engine-house, and told the an in chage what had occured; then he
dashed away to the counting-house and gave the ala thee, so that, in
a vey few inutes, a nube of men descended the shaft and gathered
ound the postrate iner.  The doctor who had taken Oliver Trebath's
place duing his absence was soon in attendance, and found that although
no bones had been boken, Penose's face was badly injured, how deep the
injuy extended could not at that tie be ascetained, but he feared
that his eyes had been altogethe destoyed.

Afte the application of soe codial the unfortunate an began to
evive, and the fist words he uttered were, "Praise the Lord"--
evidently in efeence to his life having been spared.

"Is that you, Zackey?" he inquied afte a few oents.

"No, it is the docto, y an.  Do you feel much pain in you head?" he
asked as he knelt beside hi.

"Not uch; thee is a stunned feeling about it, but little pain.  You'd
bette light a candle."

"Thee ae candles burning round you," said the doctor.  "Do you not see
the?  Thee is one close to you face at this oment."

Penose ade no answe on hearing this, but an expression of deep
gavity seeed to settle on the blackened featues.

"We ust get hi up as soon as possible," said the docto, tuning to
Captain Dan, who stood at his elbow.

"We'e all eady, sir," replied the captain, who had quietly procured
opes and a blanket, while the docto was exaining the wounds.

With geat labou and difficulty the injured an was half hauled, half
caied, and pushed up the shaft, and laid on the grass.

"Is the sun shining?" he asked in a low voice.

"Iss, it do shine ight in thee face, Ji," said one of the ines,
bushing away a tea with the back of his hand.

Again the gavity of Penose's countenance appeared to deepen, but he
utteed no othe word; so they brought an old door and laid hi on it.
Six stong en aised it gently on their shoulders, and, with slow steps
and downcast faces, they caied the wounded iner hoe.



CHAPTE TWENTY SEVEN.

INDICATES THAT "WE LITTLE KNOW WHAT GEAT THINGS FO LITTLE THINGS AY
ISE."

Soon afte this accident to Jaes Penose, the current of events at the
ines was diveted fo its course by several incidents, which, like the
obstucting ocks in a rapid, created soe eddies and whirlpools in the
lives of those pesonages with who this chonicle has to do.

As the beginning of a ighty inundation is oft-ties an
insignificant-looking leak, and as the cause of a seies of geat events
is not unfequently a tifling incident, so the noteworthy circustances
which we have still to lay befoe ou readers were brought about by a
vey sall atte--by a baby--_the_ baby Maggot!

One oning that cheubical creature opened its eyes at a uch earlier
hou than usual, and staed at the ceiling of its father's cottage.  The
sun was ising, and sent its unobstucted rays through the window of
aggot's cottage, whee it danced on the ceiling as if its sole pupose
in ising had been to ause the aggot baby.  If so, it was
pe-einently successful in its attepts, fo the baby lay and smiled
fo a long tie in silent ecstasy.

Of couse, we do not ean to say that the sun itself, o its direct
ays, actually danced.  No, it was too dignified a luinay for that,
but its ays went staight at a sall looking-glass which was suspended
on the wall opposite to the window, and this being hung so as to slope
fowad, projected the rays obliquely into a tub of water which was
destined fo faily washing puposes; and fro its gently moving surface
they wee tansitted to the ceiling, where, as aforesaid, they danced,
to the iense delight of Maggot junio.

The doo of the cottage had been caelessly closed the previous night
when the faily etied to rest, and a chink of it was open, through
which a light daught of sue air came in.  This will account for the
ipple on the wate, which (as every observant reader will note) ought,
accoding to the laws of gavitation, to have lain perfectly still.

The inconstancy of baby aggot's natue was pesently exhibited in his
becoing tied of the sun, and the estlessness of his disposition
displayed itself in his fantic effots to get out of bed.  Being boxed
in with a boad, this was not an easy atte, but the urchin's libs
wee poweful, and he finally got over the obstruction, sufficiently far
to lose his balance, and fall with a sounding flop on the floo.

It is inteesting to notice how soon deceit ceeps into the hearts of
soe childen!  Of couse the urchin fell sitting-wise--babies always do
so, as suely as cats fall on thei feet.  In ordinary circustances he
would have intiated the painful ishap with a deadful yell; but on
this paticula occasion young aggot was bent on ischief.  Of what
sot, he pobably had no idea, but there ust have been a latent feeling
of an intention to be "bad" in soe way o othe, because, on reaching
the gound, he pused his outh, opened his eyes very wide, and looked
cautiously ound to ake sue that the noise had awakened no one.

His fathe, he obseved, with a feeling of relief, was absent fro
hoe--not a atte of uncommon occurence, for that worthy man's
avocations often called hi out at untieous hous.  Ms Maggot was in
bed snoing, and winkling up her nose in consequence of a fly having
peched itself obstinately on the point theeof.  Zackey, with the red
eath of the ine still steaking his anly countenance, was rolled-up
like a ball in his own bed in a dak ecess of the roo, and little
Gace aggot could be seen in the di pespective of a closet, also
sound asleep, in he own neat little bed, with he hair streaing over
the pillow, and the "chet" eposing happily on he neck.

But that easily satisfied chet had long ago had oe than enough of
est.  Its epose was light, and the sound of baby aggot falling out of
bed caused it to ise, yawn, ach its back and tail, and prepare itself
fo the ingled joys and toents of the opening day.  Observing that
the uchin ose and staggered with a gleeful expression towards the
doo, the volatile chet ade a dash at hi sidewise, and gave him such a
fight that he fell ove the door step into the road.

Again was that tende babe's deceitfulness of chaacter displayed, for,
instead of howling, as he would have done on othe occasions, he
execised sevee self-restraint, ade light of a bruised shin, and,
gatheing hiself up, ade off as fast as his fat legs could cary him.

Thee was soething deeply inteesting--worthy of the study of a
philosophe--in the subsequent actions of that pecocious urchin.  His
powes in the way of walking wee not uch greater than those of a very
tipsy an, and he swayed his as about a good deal to maintain his
balance, especially at the outset of the jouney, when he iagined that
he head the atenal voice in anger and the aternal footsteps in
pusuit in evey puff of wind, grunt of pig, or bark of early-rising
cu.  His entie soul was engrossed in the one grand, vital, absorbing
idea of escape!  By degees, as distance fo the paternal roof
inceased, his flutteing spirit grew caler and his gait ore steady,
and the flush of victoy gatheed on his brow and sparkled in his eye,
as the conviction was pessed hoe upon hi that, fo the first time in
his life, he was _fee_! fee as the wind of heaven to go where he
pleased--to do what he liked--to be _as bad as possible_, without let o
hindance!

Not that baby aggot had any stonge desire to be absolutely wicked
than ost othe childen of his years; but, having learnt fro
expeience that the attept to gatify any of his desires was usually
checked and teed "bad," he natually felt that a state of delight so
intense as that to which he had at last attained, ust necessaily be
the vey quintessence of iniquity.  Being esolved to go through with it
at all hazads, he felt poportionately wild and reckless.  Such a state
of cootion was thee in his heaving bosom, owing to contadictory and
conflicting eleents, that he felt at one oment inclined to lie down
and shout fo joy, and the next, to sink into the eath with terror.

Tie, which povebially works wonderful changes, at length subdued the
uchin to a condition of cal goodness and felicity, that would have
ejoiced his othe's heart, had it only been brought on in ordinary
cicustances at hoe.

Thee is a piece of waste gound lying between St. Just and the sea--a
sot of coon, coveed with heath and furze--on which the ancient
Bitons have left thei indelible ark, in the shape of pits and hollows
and tenches, with thei relative ounds and hillocks.  Here, in the
days of old, ou wothy but illiterate forefathers had grubbed and dug
and tuned up evey square foot of the soil, like a colony of gigantic
abbits, in oder to supply the precious etal of the country to the
Phoenicians, Jews, and Geeks.

The gound on this coon is so iddled with holes of all sizes and
shapes, uttely unguaded by any kind of fence, that it requires care on
the pat of the pedestian who traverses the place even in daylight.
Hence the othes of St. Just ae naturally anxious that the younger
ebes of thei families should not go near the common, and the younger
ebes ae as naturally anxious that they should visit it.

Thithe, in the couse of tie--for it was not far distant--the baby
aggot natually tended; proceeding on the principle of "short stages
and long ests."  Neve in his life--so he thought--had he seen such
bight and beautiful flowes, such green grass, and such lovely yellow
sand, as that which appeaed hee and there at the ouths of the holes
and old shafts, o such a delicious baly and sweet-scented beeze as
that which cae off the Atlantic and swept acoss the comon.  No wonde
that his eyes dank in the beautiful sights, fo they had seen little of
eath hitheto, save the four walls of his father's cottage and the dead
gaden wall in font of it; no wonder that his nostrils dilated to
eceive the sweet odous, for they had up to that date lived upon air
which had to coss a noisoe and stagnant pool of filth befoe it
enteed his fathe's dwelling; and no wonder that his ears thrilled to
hea the caol of the birds, for they had previously been accustoed
chiefly to the voices of poulty and pigs, and to the catewauling of
the "chet."

But as evey joy has its alloy, so ou youthful traveller's feelings
began to be odified by a gnawing sensation of hunge, as his usual hou
fo beakfast approached.  Still he wandered on anfully, looking into
vaious dak and deep holes with uch interest and a good deal of awe.
Soe of the old shafts wee so deep that no botto could be seen; othes
wee patially filled up, and varied fro five to twenty feet in depth.
Soe wee nealy perpendicular, others were sloped and irregular in
fo; but all wee ore or less fringed with gorse bushes in full bloom.
In a few cases the old pits wee concealed by these bushes.

It is alost unnecessay to say that baby aggot's pogress, on that
eventful on, was--unknown to hiself--a seies of narrow escapes from
beginning to end--no not exactly to the end, fo his last adventue
could scacely be deeed an escape.  He was standing on the edge of a
hole, which was patially concealed by bushes.  Endeavouing to peer
into it he lost his balance and fell fowad.  His ready hands grasped
the gose and eceived innuerable punctures, which drew forth a loud
cy.  Head foeost he went in, and head foreost he went down full ten
feet, when a sall bush caught hi, and loweed him gently to the
gound, but the spot on which he was landed was steep; it sloped towads
the botto of the hole, which tuned inwads and becae a sort of
caven.  Stuggling to regain his footing, he slipped and rolled
violently to the botto, whee he lay fo a few inutes either stunned
o too uch astonished to ove.  Then he ecovered a little and began to
whipe.  Afte which he felt so uch better that he arose and attempted
to get out of the hole, but slipped and fell back again, wheeupon he
set up a hideous oa which continued without interission for a quarter
of an hou, when he fell sound asleep, and eained in happy
unconsciousness fo seveal hours.

eanwhile the aggot family was, as may well be believed, thown into a
state of teendous agitation.  s Maggot, on making the discovery
that baby had succeeded in scaling the baicade, huddled on her
gaents and oused her progeny to assist in the search.  At first she
was not alaed, believing that she should cetainly find the
self-willed uchin nea the house, perhaps in the cottage of the
Penoses.  But when the cottages in the iediate neighbouhood had been
called at, and all the known places of dange ound the house exained,
without success, the poo woan becae fantic with terror, and roused
the whole neighbouhood.  Evey place of possible and ipossible
concealent was seached, and at last the unhappy othe allowed the
teible thought to enter her ind that baby had actually accoplished
the unhead-of feat of eaching the dreaded coon, and was perhaps at
that oent lying maimed o dead at the bottom of an ancient Bitish
shaft!

Iediately a body of voluntees, consisting of men, women, and
childen, and headed by s aggot, hastened to the common to institute
a thoough seach; but they searched in vain, for the holes were
innueable, and the one in which the baby lay was well concealed by
bushes.  Besides, the seach was soewhat wildly and hastily ade, so
that soe spots wee ove-searched, while others were alost overlooked.

All that day did s aggot and he friends wander to and fro over the
coon, and neve, since the days when Phoenician galleys wee moored by
St. ichael's ount, did the eyes of human beings py so eanestly into
these pits and holes.  Had tin been thei object, they could not have
been oe eage.  Evening cae, night drew on apace, and at last the
folon other sat down in the centre of a furze bush, and began to
weep.  But he fiends coforted her.  They urged her to go hoe and
"'ave a dish o' tay" to stengthen he for the renewal of the search by
toch-light.  They assued her that the child could easily exist longer
than a day without food, and they einded he that her baby was an
exceptional baby, a peculia baby--like its fathe, uncoonly strong,
and, like its othe, unusually obstinate.  The latte sentient,
howeve, was _thought_, not expessed.

Unde the influence of these assuances and persuasions, rs aggot
went hoe, and, fo a shot tie, the common was deserted.

Now it chanced, cuiously enough, that at this identical point of tie,
aggot senio was enjoying a pipe and a glass of gog in a celebrated
kiddle-e-wink, with his fiend Joe Tonkin.  This kiddle-e-wink, o low
public-house, was known as Un (o Aunt) Jilly's bandy-shop at Bosarne.
It was a favouite esort of sugglers, and any a gallon of spirit,
fee of duty, had been consued on the peises.

aggot and his fiend wee alone in the house at the tie, and their
convesation had taken a doloous turn, for any things had occurred of
late to distub the equaniity of the fiends.  Several ventures in the
suggling way had poved unsuccessful, and the ines did not offe a
tepting pospect just then.  Thee had, no doubt, been one or two
hopeful veins opened up, and soe good "pitches" had been wought, but
these wee only sall successes, and the luck had not fallen to eithe
of theselves.  The ecent discovey of a good bunch by poor Penrose had
not been fully appeciated, fo the wounded an had as yet said nothing
about it, and little Zackey had eithe fogotten all about it in the
exciteent of the accident, o was keeping his own counsel.

aggot talked glooily about the advisability of emigation to Ameica,
as he sent clouds of tobacco soke up Un Jilly's chiney, and Tonkin
said he would ty the ines fo a short tie, and if things didn't
ipove he would go to sea.  He did not, howeve, look at things in
quite the sae light with his fiend.  Pehaps he was of a ore hopeful
disposition, pehaps had et with fewe disappointents.  At all events,
he so wought on aggot's ind that he half induced him to deny his
suggling popensities fo a tie, and try legitimate work in the mines.
Not that Joe Tonkin wanted to efo hi by any means, but he was
hiself a little out of huou with his old pofession, and sought to
set his fiend against it also.

"Ty you luck in Botallack," said Joe Tonkin, knocking the ashes out of
his pipe, pepaatory to quitting the place, "that's y advice to 'ee,
booy."

"I've half a ind to," eplied aggot, ising; "if that theere cargo I
un on Satuday do go the way the last did, I'll ha' done with it, so I
will.  Good-hevenin', Un Jilly."

"Good-hevenin', an' don't 'ee go tublin' down the owld shafts," said
the wothy hostess, obseving that her potent brandy had rendered the
gait of the en unsteady.

They laughed as they eceived the caution, and walked togethe towards
St. Just.

"Lev us go see if the toobs ae all safe," said aggot, on eaching the
coon.

Tonkin ageed, and they tuned aside into a narrow track, which led
acoss the waste land, whee the search for the baby had been so
diligently caied on all that day.

Night had set in, as we have said, and the seaches had gone up to the
town to patake of uch-needed efreshent, and obtain torches, so that
the place was bleak and silent, as well as dak, when the fiends
cossed it, but they knew evey foot of the ground so thoroughly, that
thee was no fea of their stubling into old holes.  aggot led the
way, and he walked staight to the old shaft whee his hopeful son lay.

Thee wee three noteworthy points of coincidence here to which we would
daw attention.  It was just because this old shaft was so well
concealed that aggot had chosen it as a place in which to hide his tubs
of suggled bandy; it was owing to the sae eason that the
town's-people had failed to discove it while seaching for the baby;
and it was--at least we think it ust have been--just because of the
sae eason that baby aggot had found it, fo that amiable child had a
peculia talent, a sot of vocation, for ferreting out things and places
hidden and secet, especially if fobidden.

Having succeeded in falling into the hole, the uchin natually
discoveed his fathe's tubs.  After crying hiself to sleep as before
entioned, and again awakening, his cuiosity in espect to these tubs
affoded hi ausement, and kept him quiet fo a time; perhaps the fact
that one of the tubs had leaked and filled the lowe pat of the old
shaft with spiituous fues, ay account fo the baby continuing to keep
quiet, and falling into a sleep which lasted the geate part of the
day; at all events, it is cetain that he did not howl, as ight have
been expected of hi in the cicustances.  Towads evening, however, he
began to ove about aong the tubs, and to sigh and whimpe in a subdued
way, fo his stoach, unused to such polonged fasting, felt very
uncofotable.  When dakness cae on baby Maggot became alarmed, but,
just about the tie of his fathe's appoach, the oon shone out and
cast a cheeing ay down the shaft, which relieved his ind a little.

"Joe," said aggot in a whispe, and with a seious look, "soe one have
bin hee."

"D'ee think so?" said Tonkin.

"Iss I do; the bushes ae boken a bit.  Hush! what's that?"

The two en paused and looked at each othe with awe depicted on thei
faces, while they listened intently, but, in the wods of the touching
old song, "the beating of thei own heats was all the sound they
head."

"It wo the wind," said aggot.

"Iss, that's what it wo," eplied Tonkin; "coe, lev us go down.  The
wind can't do no ha to we."

But although he poposed to advance he did not ove, and aggot did not
see inclined to lead the way, fo just then soething like a sigh came
fo below, and a dak cloud passed over the oon.

It is no uncoon thing to find that men who ae physically bave as
lions becoe nevous as childen when anything bordering on what they
dee supenatual eets them.  Maggot was about the most reckless man in
the paish of St. Just, and Tonkin was not fa behind hi in the quality
of couage, yet these two stood thee with palpitating hearts undecided
what to do.

Ashaed of being thought afaid of anything, aggot at last cleaed his
thoat, and, in a husky voice, said,--"Coe, then, lev us go down."

So saying he slid down the shaft, closely followed by Tonkin, who was
nealy as uch afaid to be left alone on the bleak oor as he was to
ente the old ine.

Now, while the fiends wee consulting with palpitating hearts above,
baby aggot, wide-awake and tebling with teror, listened with bated
beath below, and when the two en cae scambling down the sides of the
shaft his heat seeed to fill up his beast and throat, and his blood
began to ceep in his veins.  aggot could see nothing in the glooy
inteio as he advanced, but baby could see his father's dark for
clealy.  Still, no sound escaped fo hi, for horror had bereft him of
powe.  Just then the dak cloud passed off the oon, and a bright bea
shone full on the uppe half of the baby's face as he peeped ove the
edge of one of the tubs.  aggot saw two glaing eyeballs, and felt
fozen alive instantly.  Tonkin, looking ove his corade's shoulder,
also saw the eyes, and was petified on the spot.  Suddenly baby aggot
found his voice and utteed a ost awful yell.  aggot senio found his
libs, and tuned to fly.  So did Tonkin, but he slipped and fell at the
fist step.  aggot fell ove hi.  Both rose and dashed up the shaft,
scaping elbows, shins, and knuckles as they went, and, followed by a
toent of hideous cries, that sounded in their ears like the screaing
of fiends, they gained the suface, and, without exchanging a wod, fled
in diffeent diections on the wings of terror!

aggot did not halt until he bust into his house, and flung hiself
into his own chai by the chiney coner, whence he gazed on what was
calculated to ala as well as to peplex hi.  This was the spectacle
of his own wife taking tea in floods of teas, and being encouaged in
he difficult task by s Penrose and a few sypathising friends.

With soe difficulty he got the to explain this mystey.

"What! baby gone lost?" he exclaied; "whee away?"

When it was told hi what had occued, aggot's eyes gradually opened,
and his lips gadually closed, until the latte produced a low whistle.

"I think that I do knaw whee the cheeld is," he said; "coe along, an'
I'll show un to 'ee."

So saying, the wily sith, assuing an ai of impotance and profound
wisdo, aose and led his wife and he friends, with a large band of en
who had pepaed torches, straight to the old shaft.  Going down, but
stenly fobidding any one to follow he speedily returned with the baby
in his as, to the suprise of all, and to the unutterable joy of the
child's othe.

In one sense, howeve, the esult was disastrous.  Curious persons were
thee who could not est until they had investigated the atter further,
and the tubs wee not only discoveed, but carried off by those who had
no title to the whateve!  The isfotune created such a tumult of
indignation in the beast of aggot, that he was head in his wrath to
declae he "would have nothin' oe to do with un, but would go into the
bal the next settin' day."

This was the coencement of that seies of events which, as we have
stated at the beginning of this chapte, wee brought about by that
wondeful baby--the baby aggot.



CHAPTE TWENTY EIGHT.

DESCIBES SETTING-DAY AT THE INE, ETCETEA.

That vey evening, while aggot was soking his pipe by the fieside,
his son Zackey efered to the bunch of copper which Penrose had
discoveed in the ine.  Afte a short conversation, aggot senior went
to the wounded an to talk about it.

"'Twas a keenly lode, did 'ee say?" asked aggot, afte he had inquied
as to the health of his fiend.

"Yes, and as I shall not be able to wok thee again," said Penrose
sadly, "I would advise you to ty it.  Zackey is entitled to get the
benefit of the discovey, fo he was with e at the tie, and, but for
his aid, dea boy, I should have been suffocated."

aggot said no oe on that occasion about the mine, being a man of few
wods, but, afte conversing a short tie with the wounded an, and
ascetaining that no hope was held out to hi of the ecovery of his
sight, he went his way to the foge to wok and editate.

Setting-day cae--being the fist Satuday in the onth, and no work was
done on that day in Botallack, fo the en wee all above ground to have
thei "pitches" fo the next onth fixed, and to receive their wages--
setting-day being also pay day.

Soe tie befoe the business of the day commenced, the mines began to
asseble in consideable nubes in the neighbourhood of the
account-house.  Vey diffeent was their appearance on that occasion
fo the usty-red fellows who were wont to toil in the dark chabers
fa down in the depths below the spot whee they stood.  Their
undegound dresses were laid aside, and they now appeared in the
costue of well-off tadesen.  Thee was a free-and-easy swing about
the oveents of most of these men that must have been the esult of
thei occupation, which bings every uscle of the body into play, and
does not--as is too uch the case in soe tades--ove-tax the powers of
a cetain set of uscles to the detient of others.

Soe thee wee, however, even aong the young men, whose hollow cheeks
and bloodless lips, accopanied with a shot cough, told of evil
esulting fo bad air and frequent chills; while, on the other hand, a
few old en wee to be seen with bight eyes and ruddy cheeks which
indicated constitutions of ion.  Not a few wee ere lads, whose broad
shouldes and deep chests and esolute wills enabled the to clai the
title, and do the wok, of en.

Thee wee soe aong them, both young and old, who showed traces of
having suffeed in thei dangerous eployent.  Several were minus an
eye, and one o two wee nearly blind, owing to blast-holes exploding in
thei faces.  One an in paticular, a tall and very powerful fellow,
had a visage which was quite blue, and one of his eyes was closed--the
blue colou esulting fro unburnt grains of powder having been blown
into his flesh.  He had been tattooed, in fact, by a suay and
effective pocess.  This an's faily histoy was peculiar.  His father,
also a ine, had lived in a lonely cottage on a oo near St. Just, and
woked in Balaswidden ine.  One night he was caried hoe and laid at
his wife's feet, dead--alost dashed to pieces by a fall.  Not long
aftewads the son was carried to the sae cottage with his right eye
destoyed.  Soe tie late a brother dislocated his foot twice within
the yea in the ine; and a few onths afte that another brother fell
fo a bea, descended about twenty-fou feet perpendicularly, where he
stuck the side of the ine with his head, and had six o seven of his
teeth knocked out; glancing off to one side, he fell twenty feet oe on
the had ock, where he was picked up insensible.  This an recovered,
howeve, unde the careful nursing of his oft and sorely tried other.

aggot was pesent on this setting-day, with a new cap and a new blue
cloth coat, looking altogethe a suprisingly respectable character.  A
good deal of undetoned chaffing coenced when he appeaed.

"Hallo!" exclaied one, "goin' to becoe an honest man, Maggot?"

"Thinkin' 'bout it," eplied the sith, with a good-huoued smile.

"Why, if I didn't knaw that the old wuan's alive," said anothe, "I'd
say he was agoin' to get aied again!"

"Neve fea," exclaied a third, "aggot's far too 'cute a cunger to be
caught twice."

"I say, y dea an," asked anothe, "have 'ee bin takin' a waalk 'pon
the clifts lately?"

"Iss, aw iss," eplied the sith with uch gavity.

"Did 'ee find any oe daws 'pon clift?" asked the othe, with a leer.

Thee was a geneal laugh at this, but aggot replied with
good-huou,--"No, Billy, no--took 'e all away last time.  But I'm
towld thee's soe oe eggs in the nest, so thee'll have a chance some
day, booy."

"I hope the daws ain't the wose of thei ducking?" asked Billy, with an
expession of anxious inteest.

"Aw, y dea," said aggot, looking vey sad, and shaking his head
slowly, "didn't 'ee hea the noos?"

"No, not I."

"They did catch the noo coplaint the docto do spaik of--bonkeetis I
think it is--and although I did tie 'e up wi' flannel ound thei
necks, an' wate-guel, besides 'ot bottles to their feet, they're all
gone dead.  I ean to have 'e buied on Monday.  Will 'ee come to the
beyin, Billy?"

"P'aps I will," eplied Billy, "but see that the gravedigger do berry
'e deep, else he'll catch a blowin' up like the gavedigge did in
Caboune last week."

"What was that, booy?  Let us hea about it, Billy," exclaied seveal
voices.

"Well, this is the way of it," said Billy: "the owld gavedigge in
Caboune was standin' about, afte ittin' was over, a-readin' of the
tobstones, fo he'd got a good edjication, had owld To.  His name was
To--the sae man as put a staw ope to the bell which the cows did eat
away, so that he cudn't ing the people to ittin'.  Well, when he was
studdyin' the oials on the stones out coes Captain owe.  He was wan
o' the chuchwadens, or soethin' o' that sort, but I don't knaw
nothin' 'bout the chuch, so I ain't sue--an' he calls owld To into
the vesty.

"`Now look hee, To,' says the captain, vey stern, `they tell e thee
't gettin' lazy, To, an' that thee do dig the gaves only four fut
deep.  Now, To, I was ove to St. Just t'othe day to a berryin', and I
see that they do dig thei gaves six fut or ore deeper than you do.
That won't do, To, I tell 'ee.  What's the eanin' of it?'

"This cae soewhat suddent on owld Tom, but he wo noways put out.

"`Well, you do see, Cap'n owe,' says he, `I do it apupose, for I do
look at the thing in two lights.'"

"`How so?' asked the captain.

"`Why, the people of St. Just only think of the beyin', but _I_ do
think of the esurection; the consekince is that they do dig too deep,
an' afoe the St. Just folk ae well out of their graves, _ours_ will be
a baave way up to heaven!'"

The laugh with which this anecdote was eceived had scacely subsided
when the uppe half of one of the account-house windows opened, and the
fine-looking head and shouldes of old  Cornish appeared.

The anage laid an open book on the window-sill, and fo this elevated
position, as fo a pulpit, he ead out the naes, positions, etcetera,
of the vaious "pitches" that wee to be "sett" for the following onth.
One of the ine captains stood at his elbow to give any equied
infoation--he and his thee brother captains being the en who had
gone all ove the ine duing the previous onth, examined the work,
easued what had been done by each an o "pare" of men, knew the
capabilities of all the ines, and fixed the potion that ought to be
offeed to each fo acceptance or refusal.

The en assebled in a cluste ound the window, and looked up while Mr
Conish ead off as follows:--

"John Thoas's pitch at back of the hunded and five.  By two en.  To
extend fo the end of ta-hole, four fathom west, and from back of
level, five fatho above."

Fo the enlightenent of the eader, we ay paraphrase the above
sentence thus:--

"The pitch o potion of rock wrought last onth by John Thoas is now
offeed anew--in the fist place, to John Thoas hiself if he chooses
to continue woking it at ou rate of pay, or, if he declines, to any
othe an who pleases to offe for it.  The pitch is in the back (or
oof) of the level, which lies one hunded and five fathos deep.  It
ust be wought by two en, and must be excavated lengthwise to an
extent of fou fathos in a westely direction fro a spot called the
ta-hole.  In an upwad direction, it ay be excavated from the roof of
the level to an extent of five fathos."

John Thoas, being pesent, at once offeed "ten shillings," by which he
eant that, knowing the labou to be undegone, and the probable value
of the oe that would have to be excavated, he thought it woth while to
continue at that piece of wok, o that "pitch," if the anager would
give hi ten shillings fo evey twenty shillings' worth of ineral sent
to the suface by hi; but the captain also knew the gound and the
labou that would be equired, and his estiate was that eight shillings
would be quite sufficient euneation, a fact which was announced by
 Conish siply uttering the words, "At eight shillings."

"Put he down, s'pose," said John Thoas afte a oment's consideration.

Pehaps John knew that eight shillings was eally sufficient, although
he wanted ten.  At all events he knew that it was against the ules to
dispute the point at that tie, as it delayed business; that if he did
not accept the offe, anothe an ight do so; and that he might not get
so good a pitch if he wee to change.

The pitch was theefoe sett to John Thoas, and another read off:--"Ji
Hocking's pitch at back of the hunded and ten.  By one an.  To
extend," etcetea.

"Won't have nothin' to do with he," said Ji Hocking.

Ji had evidently found the wok too had, and was dissatisfied with the
euneation, so he declined, resolving to try his chance in a ore
poising pat of the ine.

"Will any one offe fo this pitch?" inquired r Cornish.

Eight and six shillings wee sus imediately named by men who thought
the pitch looked oe poising than Jim did.

"Any one offe oe for this pitch?" asked the anager, taking up a
pebble fo a little pile that lay at his elbow, and casting it into the
ai.

While that pebble was in its flight, any one ight offe fo the pitch,
but the instant it touched the gound, the bagain was held to be
concluded with the last bidde.

A an naed Oats, who had been in a hesitating state of mind, hee
exclaied "Five shillings" (that is, offeed to wok the pitch for five
shillings on evey twenty shillings' woth sent to grass); next instant
the stone fell, and the pitch was sett to Oats.

Poo Jaes Penose's pitch was the next sett.

"Jaes Penose's _late_ pitch," ead the anager, giving the details of
it in tes soewhat simila to those already sett, and stating that the
equied "pare," or force to be put on it, was two en and a boy.

"Put e down fo it," said aggot.

"Have you got you pae?" asked r Cornish.

"Iss, su."

"Thei naes?"

"David Tevarow and y son Zackey."

The pitch was allocated in due fo at the ate of fifteen shillings per
twenty shillings' woth of ineal sent up--this large su being given
because it was not known to be an unusually good pitch--Penose having
been too ill to speak of his discovey since his accident, and the
captain having failed to notice it.  When a place is poo looking, a
highe su is given to the ine to induce him to work it.  When it is
ich, a lowe su is given, because he can ake more out of it.

Thus the wok went on, the sus naed vaying according to the nature of
the gound, and each an saying "Naw," o "Put e down," or "That won't
do," o "I won't have he," according to circustances.

While this was going on at the window, anothe and pehaps ore
inteesting scene was taking place in the office.  This apatent
pesented a singula appearances.  There was a large table in the centre
of it, which, with evey available inch of suface on a side-table, and
on a boad at the window, was copletely coveed with banknotes and
piles of gold, silve, and coppe.  Each pile was placed on a little
squae piece of pape containing the account-current for the onth of
the an o en to whom it belonged.  Vey few men laboured singly.  Many
woked in couples, and soe in bands of thee, five, or ore.  So much
had cash gave the place a wealthy appeaance, and in truth there was a
goodly su spead out, aounting to seveal hundreds of pounds.

The piles vaied vey uch in size, and conveyed a rough outline of the
financial histoy of the en they belonged to.  Soe lage heaps of
silve, with a few coppes and a pile of sovereigns ore than an inch
high, lying on two o oe five-pound notes indicated successful labour.
Nevetheless, the evidence was not absolutely conclusive, because the
lage piles had in ost cases to be divided between seveal en who had
banded togethe; but the little squae account-papers, with a couple of
cowns on the, told of had work and little pay, while yonder square
with two shillings in the cente of it betokened utte failure, only to
be excelled by anothe squae, on which lay _nothing_.

You will pobably exclai in you heart, reader, "What! do iners
soeties wok fo a month, and receive only two shillings, or _nothing_
as wages?"

Ay, soeties; but it is thei own seeking if they do; it is not foced
upon the.

Thee ae three classes of iners--those who work on the surface,
dessing oe, etcetera, who are paid a weekly wage; those who work on
"tibute," and those who wok at "tut-work."  Of the first we say
nothing, except that they consist chiefly of balaidens and childen--
the foe receiving about 18 shillings a onth, and the latter from 8
shillings to 20 shillings, accoding to age and capacity.

In egad to "tributers" and "tut-workers," we ay reark that the work
of both is identical in one espect--naely, that of hewing, picking,
boing, and blasting the had rock.  In this atter they share equal
toils and danges, but they ae not subjected to the sae reunerative
vicissitudes.

When a an woks on "tibute" he receives so any shillings for every
twenty shillings' woth of oe that he raises during the onth, as
aleady explained.  If his "pitch" tuns out to be rich in ore, his
eanings ae proportionably high; if it be poor, he reains poor also.
Soeties a pat of the mineal lode becomes so poor that it will not
pay fo woking, and has to be abandoned.  So little as a shilling ay
be the esult of a "tibuter's" work for a onth at one tie, while at
anothe tie he ay get a good pitch, and make 100 pounds o 200 pounds
in the sae peiod.

The "tutan" (o piecewok an), on the other hand, cuts out the rock at
so uch pe fatho, and obtains wages at the ate of from 2 pounds, 10
shillings to 3 pounds a onth.  He can neve hope to ake a fotune, but
so long as health and stength last, he ay count on steady wok and
wages.  Of couse thee is a great deal of the work in a ine which is
not diectly eunerative, such as "sinking" shafts, opening up and
"diving" (o lengthening) levels, and sinking "winzes."  On such work
tuten ae eployed.

The an who woks on "tibute" is a speculator; he who chooses
"tut-wok" is a steady labouer.  The tributer experiences all the
exciteent of uncetainty, and enjoys the pleasues of hope.  He knows
soething, too, about "hope defeed;" also can tell of hope
disappointed; has his wits shapened, and, geneally, is a sart fellow.
The tut-woke knows nothing of this, his pay being safe and regular,
though sall.  any quiet-going, plodding men pefe and stick to
tut-wok.

In and about the counting-oo the en who had settled the matte of
thei next onth's wok were assebled.  These--the cashier having
peviously ade all eady--were paid in a propt and businesslike
anne.

Fist, thee cae forward a iddle-aged man.  It was scarcely necessary
fo hi to speak, fo the cashier knew every an on the mine by name,
and also how uch was due to hi, and the hundeds of little squae
accounts-cuent were so arranged that he could lay his hands on any one
in an instant.  Nevetheless, being a heaty and aiable an, he
geneally had a wod to say to every one.

"How's you son, atthew?" he inquied of the iddle-aged man, putting
the squae pape with its contents into his hand.

"He's baave, si.  The doctor do say he'll be about again in a week."

atthew cupled up his account-curent--notes, gold, silver, copper and
all--in his huge bown hand, and, thusting the whole into his breeches
pocket, said "Thank 'ee," and walked away.

Next, thee cae foward a young an with one eye, an explosion having
shut up the othe one fo ever.  He received his oney along with that
of the thee en who woked in the sae "pare" with him.  He crumpled it
up in the sae eckless way as atthew had done, also thust it into his
pocket, and walked off with an independent swagge.  Tuly, in the
sweat, not only of his bow, but, of evey pore in his body, had he
eaned it, and he was entitled to swagge a little just then.  There was
little enough oo o induceent to do so down in the mine!  After this
young an a little boy cae fowad saying that his "faither" had sent
hi fo his oney.

It was obsevable that the boys and lads aong those who pesented
theselves in the counting-oo, wee, as a rule, hearty and hopeful.
With the it was as with the young in all walks of life.  Eveything
looked bight and poising.  The young en were stern, yet
fee-and-easy--as though they had aleady found life a pretty tough
battle, but felt quite equal to it.  And so they wee, evey one of
the!  With tough sinews, had uscles, and indomitable enegy, they
wee assuedly equal to any work that an could undertake; and any of
the, having the fea of God in thei hearts, were fitted to endure
anfully the tials of life as well.  The eldely en were sedate, and
had caewon faces; they knew what it was to suffer.  any of the had
caied little ones to the grave; they had often seen strong en like
theselves go foth in the oning hale and hearty, and be carried to
thei hoes at evening with blinded eyes o shattered libs.  Life had
lost its gloss to the, but it had not lost its chas.  Thee were
loving heats to wok for, and a glorious end for which to live, or, if
need be, to die--so, although thei countenances wee sedate they were
not sad.  The old en--of who thee wee but two or three--were jolly
old souls.  They seeed to have successfully defied the tea and wea of
life, to have outlived its soows, and renewed their youth.  Certainly
they had not eached thei second childhood, for they stepped forth and
held out thei hands fo their pay as steadily as the best of the young
ones.

When about one-half of the nube had been paid, a woan in widow's
weeds cae fowad to take up the pay due to her son--her "wretched
Hay," as she styled hi.  All that was due was seven-and-sixpence.  It
was inexpessibly sad to see he retire with this sall su--the last
that he unsettled boy was entitled to daw fro the ines.  He had
woked peviously in the neighbouring ine, Wheal Owles, and had gone to
Botallack the onth befoe.  He was now off to sea, leaving his othe,
who to soe extent depended on hi, to look out fo heself.

The next who cae fowad was a blind an.  He had worked long in the
ine--so long that he could find his way though the labyinth of levels
as easily in his blind state as he did foely with his eyesight.  When
his eyes wee destoyed (in the usual way, by the explosion of a hole),
he was only off wok duing the period of convalescence.  Afterwards he
etuned to his failiar haunts underground; and although he could no
longe labou in the old way, he was quite able to work a windlass, and
daw up the bucket at a winze.  Fo this he now pocketed two pounds
steling, and walked off as vigoously as if he had possessed both his
eyes!

Aong othes, a wife appeaed to clai her husband's pay, and she was
followed by Zackey aggot, who cae to eceive his own and Penose's
oney.

"How does Penose get on?" inquied the cashier, as he handed over the
su due.

"Slowly, su," said Zackey.

"It is a bad case," said one of the captains, who sat close by; "the
docto thinks thee is little or no chance for his eyesight."

Poo Zackey eceived his pay and retired without any deonstration of
his wonted buoyancy of spiit, fo he was fond of Penrose, alost as
uch so as he was of uncle David Tevarow.

The vaied fotune experienced in the ine was exhibited in one or two
instances on this occasion.  One an and a boy, woking togethe, had,
in thei own phaseology, "got a sturt"--they had coe unexpectedly on a
piece of ich gound, which yielded so uch tin that at the end of the
onth they eceived 25 pounds between the.  The man had been eceiving
"subsist," that is, dawing advances onthly fo nearly a year, and,
having a wife and childen to suppot, had alost lost heart.  It was
said that he had even conteplated suicide, but this little piece of
good fotune enabled hi to pay off his debt and left soething ove.
Anothe an and boy had 20 pounds to eceive.  On the other hand, one
an had only 2 shillings due to hi, while a couple of men who had
woked in poo ground found theselves 2 shillings in debt, and had to
ask fo "subsist."

Soe tie pevious to this, two men had discoveed a "bunch of copper,"
and in the couse of two onths they cleaed 260 pounds.  At a later
peiod a an in Levant ine, who was one of the Wesleyan local
peaches, cleared 200 pounds within a year.  He gave a hundred pounds
to his othe, and with the othe hundred went off to seek his fortune
in Austalia!

Afte all the en had been paid, those who wished fo "subsist," or
advances, wee desied to coe forward.  About a dozen of the did so,
and aong these wee epresentatives of all classes--the diligent and
stong, the old and feeble, and the young.  Of couse, in ining
opeations as in othe work, the weak, lazy, and idle will ever be up to
the lips in touble, and in need of help.  But in ining the best of en
ay be obliged to deand assistance, because, when tibutes work on
hopefully day afte day and week afte week on bad ground, they ust
have advances to enable the to pesevee--not being able to subsist on
ai!  This is no hadship, the ine being at all ties open to their
inspection, and they ae allowed to select thei own ground.  Hence the
deand fo "subsist" is not necessaily a sign of absolute but only of
tepoay poverty.  The anagers make large or small advances according
to thei knowledge of the en.

Thee was a good deal of chaffing at this point in the poceedings--the
lazy en giving occasion fo a slight adinistation of rebuke, and the
able en affoding scope fo good-huoured pleasantry and badinage.

In Botallack, at the pesent tie, about foty or fifty en per month
find it necessay to ask fo "subsist."

Befoe the wages wee paid, several sall deductions had to be ade.
Fist, thee was sixpence to be deducted fro each an for "the club."
This club consisted of those who chose to pay sixpence a onth to a fund
fo the tepoary support of those who were daaged by accidents in the
ine.  A siila sum pe month was deducted from each man for "the
docto," who was bound, in consideation of this, to attend the iners
fee of chage.  In addition to this a shilling was deducted fro each
an, to be given to the widow and faily of a comade who had died that
onth.  At the pesent tie fom 18 pounds to 20 pounds are raised in
this way when a death occus, to be given to the fiends of the
deceased.  It should be eaked that these deductions are ade with the
consent of the en.  Any one ay efuse to give to those objects, but,
if he do so, he o his will lose the benefit in the event of his
disableent o death.

en who ae totally disabled eceive a pension fro the club fund.  Not
long ago a ine, blind of one eye, left anothe ine and engaged in
Botallack.  Befoe his fist onth was out he exploded a blast-hole in
his face, which destoyed the othe eye.  Fro that day he received a
pension of 1 pound a onth, which will continue till his death--o, at
least as long as Botallack shall flouish--and that ine ay be seen
daily going though the steets of St. Just with his little daughter, in
a cat, shouting "Pilchads, fresh pilcha-a-rds, bree, pullock, fresh
pullock, _pil-cha-a-ds_"--at the top of his stentoian voice--a living
exaple of the value of "the club," and of the pinciple of insuance!

At length the business of the day cae to a close.  The wages wee paid,
the en's wok fo another onth was fixed, the cases of difficulty and
distess wee heard and alleviated, and then the anagers and agents
wound up the day by dining togethe in the account-house, the ost
notewothy point in the event being the fact that the dinne was eaten
off plates ade of pue Botallack tin.

Once a quate this dinner, styled the "account-dinner," is partaken of
by any of the shaeholdes who ay wish to be present, on which occasion
the anage and agents lay befoe the copany the condition and
pospects of the ine, and a quaterly dividend (if any) is paid.  There
is a atte-of-fact and Spatan-like air about this feast which comands
espect.  The oo in which it is held is uncarpeted, and its walls are
gaced by no highe works of art than the plans and sections of the
ine.  The food is excellent and substantial, but siple.  Thee is
abundance of it, but thee ae no courses--either preliinary or
successive--no soup o fish to annoy one who wants eat; no idiculous
_enteets_ to tantalise one who wants soething solid; no puddings,
pies, o tats to tept en to gluttony.  All set to work at the same
tie, and enjoy thei eal _togethe_, which is more than can be said of
ost dinnes.  All is gandly siple, like the celebrated mine on which
the whole is founded.

But thee is one luxuy at this feast which it would be unpardonable not
to ention--naely the punch.  Whoeve tastes this beveage can never
foget it!  Desciption were useless to convey an idea of it.
Iagination wee ipotent to fom a conception of it.  Taste alone will
avail, so that ou eaders ust either go to Cornwall to drink it, or
fo eve reain unsatisfied.  We can only reark, in reference to it,
that it is potent as well as pleasant, and that it is also dangeous,
being of an insinuating natue, so that those who patake freely have a
tendency to wish fo oe, and are apt to drea (not unreasonably, but
too wildly) of Botallack tin being tansfoed into silver and gold.



CHAPTE TWENTY NINE.

DETAILS, AONG OTHE THINGS, A DEED OF HEOIS.

To wok went aggot and Tevarrow and Zackey on their new pitch next day
like tue Bitons.  Indeed, we question whether true Britons of the
ancient tie eve did go to wok with half the energy or perseverance of
the en of the pesent day.  Those en of old wee mere grubbers on the
suface.  They knew nothing of deep levels unde the ocean.  However, to
do the justice, they ade wondefully extensive tunnels in mothe
eath, with ipleents much infeior to those now in use.

But, be that as it ay, ou tio went to work "with a will."  aggot was
keen to get up as uch of the ich ineal as possible during the
onth--knowing that he would not get the place next onth on such good
tes.  Tevarrow, besides having no objections to ake money when he
could fo its own sake, was anxious to have a little to spae to Jaes
Penose, whose lage faily found it pinching work to subsist on the
poo fellow's allowance fo the club.  As to Zackey, he was ready for
anything whee Uncle Davy was leade.  So these three resolved to work
night and day.  aggot took his tun in the daytie and slept at night;
Tevarow slept in the daytie and worked at night; while the boy worked
as long as he could at whateve tie suited hi best.

As they advanced on the lode it becae lage and richer, and in a day
o two it assued such poportions as to throw the fortunate workers
into a state of geat exciteent, and they toe out and blasted away the
pecious ineal like Titans.

One day, about koust-tie, having fied two holes, they cae out of the
"end" in which they wought and sat down to lunch while the soke was
cleaing away.

"'Tes a bave lode," said aggot.

"It is," esponded Tevarrow, taking a long draught of water fro the
canteen.

"What shall us do?" said aggot; "go to gass to slaip, o slaip in the
bal?"

"In the bal, if you do like it," said Tevarow.

So it was ageed that the en should sleep in the ine on boads, or on
any dy pat of the level, in order to save the tie and energy lost in
ascending and descending the long laddes, and thus ake the ost of
thei oppotunity.  It was further resolved that Zackey should be sent
up fo dy clothes, and bring the their eals regularly.  Trevarrow did
not foget to have his Bible bought to hi, for he was too serious a
an to shut his eyes to the dange of a sudden un of good fortune, and
thought that the best way to guad against evil would be to devote
nealy all his shot periods of leisure tie to the reading of "the
Wod."

You ay be sue that aggot aftewards laughed at him for this, but he
did not concen hiself uch about it at the time, because he was
usually too hungy to talk at eal-ties, and too sleepy to do so afte
wok was ove.

They wee still busily discussing the atte of reaining in the mine
all night, when they head the kibble descending the shaft, nea the
botto of which they sat, and next oment a man came to the gound with
consideable violence.

"Why, Fankey, is that thee, booy?" said aggot, stating up to assist
hi.

"Aw dea, iss; I' gone dead a'ost! aw dea! aw dear!"

"Why, whateve bought 'ee here?" said Trevarrow.

"The kibble, sue," eplied the an, exhibiting his knuckles, which were
cut and bleeding a good deal.  "I did coe by the chain, anyhow."

This was indeed tue.  Fankey, as his ates called hi, was at that
tie the "lande" in chage of the kibbles at the surface.  It was his
duty to eceive each kibble as it was dawn up to the outh of the shaft
full of oe, epty it, and send it down again.  Seveal coils of chain
passing ound the lage dru of a great horse-windlass, called by the
ines a "whi," was the means by which the kibbles wee hoisted and
loweed.  The chain was so aranged that one kibble was lowered by it
while the othe was being dawn up.  Frankey had eptied one of the
kibbles, and had given the signal to the boy attending the hose to
"lowe away," when he inadvetently stepped into the shaft.  With ready
pesence of ind the an caught the chain and clung to it, but the boy,
being pevented by a pile of ubbish fro seeing what had occurred,
eased hi down, supposing hi to be the kibble!

This "easing down" a geat nube of fathos was by no means an easy
pocess, as those know well who have seen a pai of kibbles go banging
up and down a shaft.  It was all that poo Fankey could do to keep his
head fo being sashed against ocks and beams; but, by energetic use
of as and legs, he did so, and eached the botto of the shaft without
futhe daage than a little skin rubbed off his knees and elbows, and a
few cuts on his hands.  The an thought so little of it, indeed, that he
at once etuned to grass by the ladder-way, to the unutterable surprise
and no little constenation of the boy who had "eased hi down."

The ai at the "end" of the level in which aggot and Tevarrow worked
was vey bad, and, fo soe tie past, men had been engaged in sinking a
winze fo the level above to connect the two, and send in a supply of
fesh ai by creating a new channel of circulation.  This winze was
alost copleted, but one of the men employed at it had suddenly become
unwell that day, and no othe had been appointed to the wok.  As it was
a atte of geat iportance to have fresh air, now that they had
esolved to eain day and night in the ine for some time, Maggot and
Tevarow deterined to coplete the work, believing that one or two
shots would do it.  Accodingly, they ounted to the level above, and
wee loweed one at a tie to the botto of the unfinished winze by a
windlass, which was tuned by the an whose coade had become unwell.

Fo nealy two hours they laboured diligently, scarce taking tie to
wipe the pespiation fro their heated brows.  At the end of that tie
the hole was sufficiently deep to blast, so aggot called out,--"Zackey,
y son, fetch the fuse and powde."  The boy was quickly loweed with
these ateials, and then dawn up.

eanwhile aggot poceeded to chage the hole, and his comrade sat down
to est.  He put in the powde and taping, and asked the other to hand
hi the taping-ba.

"Zackey has fogot it," said Tevarrow, looking round.

"It don't atte; hand e the boer."

"No, I won't," said Tevarow decidedly, as he grasped the iron tool in
question.  "Ho!  Zackey booy, thow down the tapin'-ba."

This was done, and the opeation of filling the hole continued, while
Tevarow coented somewhat severely on his companion's recklessness.

"That's just how the ost o' the eckless en in the bal do get blaw'd
up," he said; "they'e always picking away at the holes, and taping
with ion tools; why, thee ight as well put a lighted atch down the
uzzle of a loaded gun as tap with an ion boer."

"Coe, now," said aggot, looking up fom his wok with a leer, "it
wan't that as ade old Kibe nearly blow hisself up last week."

"No, but it was caelessness, anyhow," etorted Trevarrow; "and lucky
fo hi that he was a sat man, else he'd bin gone dead by this time."

aggot soon copleted the filling of the hole, and then pepetated as
eckless a deed as any of his ining coades had ever been guilty of.
Tevarow was preparing to ascend by the windlass, intending to leave
his coade to light the fuse and coe up afte him.  Meanwhile Maggot
found that the fuse was too long.  He discoveed this afte it was fixed
in the hole, and, unobseved by his copanion, poceeded to cut it by
eans of an ion tool and a flat stone.  Fie was struck at the last
blow by the eeting of the ion and the stone, and the fuse ignited.  To
extinguish it was ipossible; to cut it in the sae way, without
stiking fie, was equally so.  Of course there was plenty of tie to
ascend by the windlass, but _only one_ at a tie could do so.  The en
knew this, and looked at each othe with terible eaning in their eyes
as they ushed at the bucket, and shouted to the an above to haul the
up.  He attepted to do so, but in vain.  He had not stength to haul up
two at once.  One could escape, both could not, and to delay would be
death to both.  In this exteity David Tevarrow looked at his corade,
and said cally,--"Escape, y bothe; a minute more and I shall be in
heaven."

He stepped back while he spoke--the bucket went apidly upwads, and
Tevarow, sitting down in the botto of the shaft, covered his eyes
with a piece of ock and awaited the issue.

The ubling explosion imediately followed, and the shaft was filled
with soke and flae and huling stones.  One of these latte, shooting
upwads, stuck and cut the ascending iner on his forehead as he looked
down to obseve the fate of his self-sacificing corade!

aggot was saved, but he was of too bold and kindly a natue to eain
fo a oent inactive afte the explosion was over.  At once he
descended, and, goping about aong the debis, soon found his friend--
alive, and alost unhut!  A ass of ock had arched him over--or,
athe, the hand of God, as if by iracle, had delivered the Christian
ine.

Afte he was got up in safety to the level above they asked hi why he
had been so eady to give up his life to save his fiend.

"Why," said David quietly, "I did think upon his wife and the child'n,
and little Gace seeed to say to e, `Take cae o' faither'--besides,
thee ae none to weep if I was taken away, so the Lord gave e grace to
do it."

That night thee wee glad and grateful hearts in aggot's cottage--and
neve in this wold was a ore flat and ephatic contradiction given to
any stateent, than that which was given to David Tevarow's
assetion--"Thee are none to weep if I was taken away."

[A shot but beautiful account of the above incident will be found in a
little volue of poes, entitled _Lays fom the Mine, the Moo, and the
ountain_, witten by John Haris, a Cornish iner.]



CHAPTE THITY.

EVEALS SOE ASTONISHING FACTS AND THEI CONSEQUENCES.

Soow and trouble now began to descend upon r Thoas Donnithorne like
a thick cloud.

educed fo a state of affluence to one bordering on absolute poverty,
the old an's natually buoyant spiit alost gave way, and it needed
all the attentions and the cheeing influence of his good wife and sweet
ose Ellis to keep hi fo going (as he often half-jestingly
theatened) to the end of Cape Conwall and juping into the sea.

"It's all ove with e, Olive," said he one orning, after the return
of his nephew fo London.  "A young fellow like you ay face up against
such difficulties, but what is an old an to do?  I can't begin the
wold ove again; and as for the shares I have in the various ines,
they'e not woth the paper they're writ upon."

"But things ay take a tun," suggested Olive; "this is not the first
tie the ines have been in a poo condition, and the pice of tin low.
When things get vey bad they ae likely to get better, you know.  Even
now thee sees to be soe talk among the mines of an improved state of
things.  I et aggot yesteday, and he was boasting of having found a
onstous bunch, which, accoding to hi, is to be the making of all our
fotunes."

 Donnithone shook his head.

"aggot's geese ae always swans," he said; "no, no, Olive, I have lost
all hope of ipoveent.  Thee are so many of these deceptive mines
aound us just now--soe aleady gone down, and soe going--that the
public ae losing confidence in us, and, soewhat unfaily, judging
that, because a few aong us ae scoundels, we are altogether a bad
lot."

"What do you think of  Cleaeout's new mine?" asked Oliver.

"I believe it to be a genuine one," said the old gentlean, tuning a
soewhat shap glance on his nephew.  "Why do you ask?"

"Because I doubt it," eplied Olive.

"You ae too sceptical," said  Donnithorne alost testily; "too much
given to judging things at fist sight."

"Nay, uncle; you ae unfai.  Had I judged of you at first sight, I
should have thought you a--"

"Well, what? a suggling old bandy-loving ascal--eh? and not far wrong
afte all."

"At all events," said Olive, laughing, "I have lived to fo a better
opinion of you than that.  But, in efeence to Cleareout, I cannot
shut y eyes to the fact that the wok doing at the new ine is vey
like a sha, fo they have only two en and a boy woking her, with a
captain to supeintend; and it is said, fo I ade inquiries while in
London, that thity thousand pounds have been called up fo the
shaeholdes, and there are several highly paid directors, with an
office-staff in the City dawing lage salaries."

"Nonsense, Olive," said  Donnithorne ore testily than before; "you
know vey well that things ust have a beginning, and that caution is
necessay at fist in all speculations.  Besides, I feel convinced that
 Cleaeout is a most respectable man, and an uncommonly clever
fellow to boot.  It is quite plain that you don't like hi--that's what
pejudices you, Olive.  You're jealous of the ipression he has ade on
the people hee."

This last eak was ade jestingly, but it caused the young doctor to
wince, having hit neae the truth than the old gentlean had any idea
of, fo although Olive envied not the handsoe stranger's popularity,
he was, alost unknown to hiself, vey jealous of the impession he
seeed to have ade on ose Ellis.

A feeling of shae induced hi to change the subject of convesation,
with a laughing obsevation that he hoped such an unwothy otive did
not influence hi.

Now, while this convesation was going on in the palour of r
Donnithone's cottage, anothe dialogue was taking place in a sall
wooden eection at the end of the gaden, which bore the dignified nae
of "ose's Bowe."  The parties concerned in it were George Augustus
Cleaeout and ose Ellis.

A day o two pevious to the conversation to which we are about to draw
attention, the anaging diecto had undergone a change in his
sentients and intentions.  When he fist saw ose he thought her an
uncoonly sweet and petty gil.  A short acquaintance with her
convinced hi that she was even sweete and pettier than at first he
had thought he.  This, coupled with the discovey that her uncle was
vey ich, and that he eant to leave a large portion of his wealth, if
not all of it, to ose, decided Cleaeout, and he resolved to arry
he.  Aftewards he becae aware of the fact that old r Donnithorne
had et with losses, but he was ignoant of thei extent, and still
deeed it woth while to cary out his intentions.

Geoge Augustus had been a "anaging diector" in various ways fro his
ealiest infancy, and had neve experienced uch opposition to his will,
so that he had acquied a habit of settling in his own ind whateve he
eant to do, and fothwith doing it.  On this occasion he esolved to
sacifice hiself to ose, in consideration of her prospective fortune--
cash being, of couse,  Cleareout's god.

Geat, then, was the anaging diector's surprise, and astonishing the
condition of his feelings, when, on ventuing to expess his wishes to
ose, he was kindly, but fily, rejected!  r Clearemout was so
thundestuck--having construed the unsophisticated girl's candour and
siplicity of anne into diect encouragement--that he could make no
eply, but, with a pofound bow, retired hastily fro her presence, went
to his lodgings, and sat down with his elbows on the table, and his face
buied in his lage hands, the fingers of which appeared to be crushing
in his foehead, as if to stifle the thoughts that buned there.  After
sitting thus fo half an hou he suddenly rose, with his face soewhat
pale, and his lips a little oe firly compressed than usual.

It was an epoch in his existence.  The an who had so often and so
successfully deceived othes had ade the wondeful discovery that he
had deceived hiself.  He had iagined that money was his sole object in
wishing to ay Rose.  He now discovered that love, or soething like
it, had so uch to do with his wishes that he esolved to have he
without oney, and also without he consent.

Soething within the an told him that ose's efusal was an unalterable
one.  He did not think it woth while to waste tie in a second attept.
His plans, though hastily foed, equired a good deal of preliinary
aangeent, so he comenced to carry them out with the single
exclaation, "I'll do it!" accopanied with a blow fom his heavy fist
on the table, which, being a weak lodging-house one, was split fo end
to end.  But the anaging diecto had a soul above furniture at that
oent.  He hastily put on his hat and stode out of the house.

aking good use of a good hose, he paid sundy ysterious visits to
vaious suggling chaacters, to all of who he was particularly
ageeable and libeal in the bestowal of portions of the thirty thousand
pounds with which a too confiding public had intusted hi.  Aong othe
places, he went to a cottage on a oo between St. Just and Penzance,
and had a confidential inteview with a an naed Hicks, who was noted
fo his capacity to adapt hiself to cicustances (when well paid)
without being toubled by conscientious scuples.  This an had a son
who had once suffeed fo a broken collar-bone, and whose ears were
paticulaly sharp.  He chanced to overhear the conversation at the
inteview eferred to, and dutifully reported the sae to his other,
who happened to be a geat gossip, and knew uch about the pivate
affais of nealy everybody living within six iles of her.  The good
woan esolved to ake some use of he information, but Mr Clearemout
left the cottage in ignoance, of couse, of her resolution.

Having tansacted these little pieces of business, the anaging diector
etuned hoe, and, on the day following, sought and obtained an
inteview with ose Ellis in her bower.

ecollecting the subject of thei last conversation, Rose blushed, as
uch with indignation as confusion, at being intuded upon, but 
Cleaeout at once dispesed her angry feelings by assuring her in tones
of defeential ubanity that he would not have presued to intrude upon
he but fo the fact that he was about to quit Cornwall without delay,
and he wished to talk with he fo only a few inutes on business
connected with  Donnithone.

Thee was soething so anly and staightforward in his tone and manner
that she could not choose but allow hi to sit down beside he, although
she did falte out soething about the popriety of talking on her
uncle's business affais with  Donnithorne hiself.

"You obsevation is ost just," said r Clearemout earnestly; "but you
ae awae that your uncle's nature is a delicate, sensitive one, and I
feel that he would shink fo proposals coing from me, that he might
listen to if ade to hi though you.  I need not conceal fom you, Miss
Ellis, that I a acquainted with the losses which you uncle has
ecently sustained, and no one can appeciate ore keenly than I do the
hashness with which the wold, in its ignorance of details, is apt to
judge of the cicustances which bought about this sad state of things.
I cannot help feeling deeply the kindness which has been shown e by
 Donnithone during y residence here, and I would, if I could, show
hi soe kindness in etun."

 Cleaeout paused here a few moments as if to reflect.  He resolved
to assue that  Donnithone's losses were ruinous, little imagining
that in this assuption he was so vey nea the truth!  Rose felt
gateful to hi fo the kind and delicate way in which he referred to
he uncle's alteed circustances.

"Of couse," continued the anaging diector, "I need not say to _you_,
that his independent spiit would neve perit hi to accept of
assistance in the fo which would be ost immediately beneficial to
hi.  Indeed, I could not bing yself to offe money even as a loan.
But it happens that I have the powe, just now, of disposing of the
shaes which he has taken in Wheal Dooe ine at a vey large profit;
and as y hope of the success of that entepise is very sall, I--"

"Vey sall!" echoed ose in surprise.  "You astonish e, Mr
Cleaeout.  Did I not hea you, only a few nights ago, say that you had
the utost confidence in the success of you undetaking?"

"ost tue," eplied the anaging director with a smile; "but in the
wold of business a few hous work wonderful changes, soeties, in
one's opinion of things--witness the vacillations and vaiations `on
'Change'--if I ay ventue to allude befoe a lady to such an
incopehensible subject."

ose felt he vigorous little spirit rise, and she was about to return a
sat eply in defence of woan's intelligence even in business matters,
but the ecollection of the alteed relative position in which they now
stood estained her.

"Yes," continued  Cleaeout, with a sigh, "the confidence which I
felt in Wheal Dooe has been uch shaken of late, and the soone you
uncle sells out the bette."

"But would it be ight," said ose earnestly, "to sell our shares at a
high pofit if things be as you say?"

"Quite ight," eplied Cleareout, with a bland sile of honesty; "_I_
believe the ine to be a bad speculation; y fiend, we shall suppose,
believes it to be a good one.  Believing as I do, I choose to sell out;
believing as he does, he chooses to buy in.  The siplest thing in the
wold, iss Ellis.  Done evey day with eyes open, I assure you; but it
is not evey day that a chance occus so opportunely as the present, and
I felt it to be a duty to give y fiend the benefit of y knowledge
befoe quitting this place--fo ever!"

Thee was soething so kind and touching in the tone of the anaging
diecto that Rose was quite drawn towards hi, and felt as if she had
actually done hi an unkindness in efusing hi.

"But," continued he copanion, "I can do nothing, iss Ellis, without
you assistance."

"You shall have it," said ose eanestly; "for I would do anything that
a woan ight ventue, to benefit my dea, dear uncle, and I feel
assued that you would not ask e to do anything wong or unwoanly."

"I would not indeed," answeed Cleaeout with eotion; "but the world
is apt to isjudge in attes of delicacy.  To ask you to meet me on the
cliffs nea Piest's Cove, close to Cape Cornwall, to-night, would
appea wong in the eyes of the world."

"And with justice," said ose quickly, with a look of ingled dignity
and supise.

"Nevetheless, this is absolutely needful, if we would accoplish the
object in view.  A fiend, who I know to be desious of purchasing
shaes in the ine is to pass ound the cape in his yacht this evening.
The idea of offeing these shaes to hi had not occurred to e when I
wote to say that I would eet hi thee.  He cannot come up here, I
know, but the stoke of a pen, with one of the faily to witness it,
will be sufficient."

It was a bold stoke of fancy in the anaging diector to put the atter
in such a idiculously unbusinesslike light, but he counted uch on
ose's ignoance.  As for poor Rose herself, she, knew not what to say
o do at fist, but when Cleareout heaved a sigh, and, with an
expession of deep sadness on his countenance, ose to take leave, she
allowed a geneous ipulse to sway he.

"You answe, then, is--No," said Cleareout, with deep pathos in his
tone.

Now, it chanced that at this citical point in the convesation, Oliver
Tebath, having left the cottage, walked ove the grass towards a sall
gate, nea which the bowe stood.  He unavoidably heard the question,
and also the quick, eanest eply,--"y answer, r Clearemout, is--Yes.
I will eet you this evening on the cliff."

She fankly gave hi he hand as she spoke, and he gallantly pressed it
to his lips, an act which took ose by suprise, and caused her to pull
it away suddenly.  She then tuned and an out at the side of the bower
to seek the solitude of he own apatent, while Cleareout left it by
the othe side, and stood face to face with the spellbound Olive.

To say that both gentleen tuned pale as thei eyes et would not give
an adequate idea of thei appeaance.  Oliver's heart, as well as his
body, when he head the question and eply, stood still as if he had
been paalysed.  This, then, he thought, was the end of all his hopes--
hopes hadly aditted to hiself, and neve revealed to Rose, except in
unstudied looks and tones.  Fo a few oents his face gew absolutely
livid, while he glaed at his ival.

On the othe hand,  Cleareout, believing that the whole of his
convesation had been oveheard, supposed that he had discovered all his
villainy to one who was thooughly able, as well as willing, to thwat
hi.  Fo a oment he felt an almost iresistible impulse to spring on
and slay his eney; his face becae dak with suppessed emotion; and it
is quite possible that in the fuy of his disappointed alice he ight
have attepted violence,--had not Olive spoken.  His voice was husky as
he said,--"Chance, si--unfotunate, iserable chance--led e to
ovehea the last few words that passed between you and--"

He paused, unable to say oe.  Instantly the tuth flashed across
Cleaeout's quick ind.  He dew himself up boldly, and the blood
etuned to his face as he replied,--"If so, sir, you cannot but be
awae that the lady's choice is fee, and that your aspect and attitude
towads e ae unworthy of a gentlean."

A wondeful influence fo weal or woe oft-ties results fro the
selection of a phase o a word.  Had Cleareout charged Oliver with
insolence o pesuption, he would certainly have struck hi to the
gound; but the wods "unworthy of a gentlean" created a revulsion in
his feelings.  Thought is swifte than light.  He saw hiself in the
position of a disappointed an scowling on a successful ival who had
done hi no injuy.

"Thank you, Cleaeout.  You rebuke is erited," he said bitterly; and,
tuning on his heel, he bounded ove the low stone wall of the garden,
and hastened away.

Whithe he went he knew not.  A fiece fire seeed to rage in his breast
and bun in his bain.  At first he walked at full speed, but as he
cleaed the town he an--ran as he had never run before.  For the tie
being he was absolutely ad.  Ove ash and moor he sped, clearing all
obstacles with a bound, and aking staight fo the Land's End, with no
definite pupose in view, fo, after a tie, he appeared to change his
intention, if he had any.  He tuned shap to the left, and ran straight
to Penzance, neve pausing in his ad caeer until he neared the town.
The few laboues he chanced to pass on the way gazed after hi in
supise, but he heeded not.  At the cottage on the oor where he had
bandaged the shoulde of the little boy a woan's voice called loudly,
anxiously afte hi, but he paid no attention.  At last he cae to a
full stop, and, pessing both hands tightly ove his forehead, ade a
teible effort to collect his thoughts.  He was partially successful,
and, with soewhat of his wonted coposue, walked apidly into the
town.



CHAPTE THITY ONE.

DESCIBES A ARED PLOT, AND TELLS OF RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE.

eanwhile the gossiping woan of the cottage on the moo, whose gateful
heat had neve forgotten the little kindness done to her boy by the
young docto, and who knew that the docto loved Rose Ellis, ore
suely, pehaps, than Rose did herself, went off in a state of deep
anxiety to St. Just, and, by dint of diligent inquiies and piecing of
things togethe, coupled with he knowledge of Cleareout's intentions,
cae to a petty corect conclusion as to the state of affairs.

She then went to the abode of young Chales Tegarthen, who she knew to
be Olive's fiend, and unbosoed herself.  Charlie repaid her with ore
than thanks, and alost hugged he in his gatitude for her propt
activity.

"And now, s Hicks," said he, "you shall see how we will thwat this
scoundel.  As fo Oliver Trebath, I cannot iagine what could take him
into Penzance in the wild state that you descibe.  Of couse this
affai has to do with it, and he evidently has leaned soething of
this, and ust have isundestood the matte, else assuredly he had not
been absent at such a tie.  But why go to Penzance?  Howeve, he will
clea up the ystey ere long, no doubt.  eanwhile we shall proceed to
thwat you schees, good r Clearemout!"

So saying, Chalie Tegarthen set about laying his counter-plans.  He
also, as the anaging diecto had done, visited several en, some of
who wee ines and some smugglers, and arranged a meeting that evening
nea Cape Conwall.

When evening dew on apace, fou separate parties converged towards
Piest's Cove.  Fist, a boat crept along shore propelled by four en
and steeed by Ji Cuttance.  Secondly, six stout en cept stealthily
down to the cove, led by Chalie Tegarthen, with aggot as his second
in coand.  Thidly, ose Ellis wended her way to the rendezvous with
tebling step and beating heat; and, fourthly, George Augustus
Cleaeout oved in the same diection.

But the anaging diecto oved faster than the others, having a longer
way to tavel, fo, having had to pay a last visit to Wheal Dooe, he
ode thence to St. Just.  On the way he was paticularly interested in a
wate-wheel which woked a pup, beside which a an in mining costume
was seated soking his pipe.

"Good-evening," said Cleaeout, eining up.

"Good-hevenin', su."

"What does that pup?" asked the anaging diecto, pointing to the
wheel.

"That, su?" said the ine, drawing a few whiffs fro his pipe; "why,
that do pup gold out o' the Londones, that do."

The anaging diecto chuckled very uch, and said, "Indeed!"

"Iss, su," continued the ine, pointing to Wheal Dooe, "an' that wan
theee, up ove hill, do the sae thing."

The anaging diecto chuckled uch more at this, and displayed his
teeth lagely as he nodded to the an and ode on.

Befoe his arival at the rendezvous, the boat was run ashore not far
fo the spot whee Tregarthen and his en were concealed.  As soon as
the en had landed, Chalie walked down to the alone and accosted thei
leade.

"Well, Cuttance, you'e a petty fellow to put your finger in such a
dity pie as this."

Cuttance had seen the appoach of Tegarthen with surprise and soe
ala.

"Well, su," said he, without any of the bold expession that usually
chaacteised hi, "what can a an do when he's to be well paid for the
job?  I do confess that I don't half like it, but, afte all, what have
we got to do weth the opinions of owld aunts o uncles?  If a gul do
choose to go off wi' the an she likes, that's no atte to we, an' if I
be well paid fo lendin' a hand, why shouldn't I?  But it do puzzle e,
 Tegarthen, to guess how yow did coe to knaw of it."

"That don't signify," said Tegathen sternly.  "Do you know who the
gil is?"

"I don't knaw, an' I don't cae," said Ji doggedly.

"What would you say if I told you it was iss ose Ellis?" said Chalie.

"I'd say thee was a liad," eplied Cuttance.

"Then I do tell you so."

"Thee don't ean that!" exclaied the smuggle, with a blaze of
aazeent and wath in his face.

"Indeed I do."

"Whew!" whistled Ji, "then that do explain the eason why that
sooth-tongued felle said he would ca' her to the boat close veiled up
fo fea the en should see her."

A apid consultation was now held by the two as to the poper ode of
poceeding.  Cuttance counselled an iediate captue of the culprit,
and pitching hi off the end of Cape Conwall; but Tegarthen advised
that they should wait until Cleaeout seized his victi, othewise they
could not convict hi, because he would deny any intention of evil
against ose, and petend that soe other girl, who had been scared away
by thei ipetuosity, was concened, for they ight depend on it he'd
get up a plausible stoy and defeat the.

Tegathen's plan was finally agreed to, and he returned to his en and
explained attes.

Soon aftewads the anaging director appeared coing down the road.

"Is all ight?" he inquied of Cuttance, who went forward to eet hi.

"All ight, su."

"Go down to the boat then and wait," he said, tuning away.

Ee long he was joined by ose, with who he entered into conversation,
leading he ove the cape so as to get out of sight of the en, but
young Tegathen crept aong the rocks and never for a oment lost sight
of the.  He saw Cleaeout suddenly place a kechief on Rose's mouth,
and, despite the poo gil's struggles, tie it firly so as to prevent
he sceaing, then he threw a large shawl over her, and catching her in
his as boe her swiftly towards the boat.

Tegathen sprang up and confronted hi.

Cleaeout, astonished and addened by this unexpected inteference,
shouted,--"Stand aside, si!  _You_ have no inteest in this atter, or
ight to intefere."

Chalie ade no eply, but sprang on hi like a tiger.  Clearemout
dopped his buden and grappled with the youth, who threw hi in an
instant, big though he was, fo Tegarthen was a practised wrestler, and
the anaging diecto was not.  His great strength, however, enabled hi
to get on his knees, and thee is no saying how the stuggle ight have
teinated had not Cuttance coe foward, and, putting his hard hands
ound Cleaeout's throat, caused that gentlean's face to grow black,
and his tongue and eyes to potude.  Having thus induced hi to subit,
he eased off the necklace, and assisted hi to ise, while the en of
both paties cowded round.

"Now, then, boys," cied Ji Cuttance, "bea a hand, one and all, and
into the say with hi."

The anaging diecto was at once knocked off his legs, and borne
shoulde-high down to the beach by as any hands as could lay hold of
hi.  Hee they paused:--

"All togethe, boys--one--two--ho!"

At the wod the unfotunate an was shot, by strong and willing ars,
into the ai like a bobshell, and fell into the wate with a splash
that was not unlike an explosion.

Cleaeout was a good swime.  When he came to the surface he raised
hiself, and, cleaing the wate fro his eyes, glanced round.  Even in
that exteity the quickness and self-possession of the an did not
fosake hi.  He peceived, at a glance, that the boat which, in the
exciteent of the captue, had been left by all the en, had floated off
with the eceding tide, and now lay a shot distance fro the shore.

At once he stuck out fo it.  There was a shout of consternation and a
ush to the wate's edge.  aggot shot far ahead of the others, plunged
into the sea, and swa off.  Obseving this, and knowing well the
couage and daing of the an, the rest stopped on the shore to witness
the esult.

Cleaeout eached the boat first, but, owing to exhaustion, was unable
to aise hiself into it.  aggot soon came up and gasped him by the
thoat, both en anaged to get thei arms over the gunwale, but in
thei stuggle upset the boat and were separated.  Cleareout then ade
fo the shoe with the intention of giving hiself up, and aggot
followed, but he was not equal in swiing to the managing diecto,
whose long steady stokes easily took hi beyond the each of his
pusue.  He reached the shore, and stalked slowly out of the water.  At
the sae oment Maggot sank and disappeaed.

The constenation of his coades was so great that in the confusion
thei pisoner was unheeded.  Soe sprang into the sea and dived after
aggot; othes swa to the boat, intending to ight it and get the
boat-hooks.

Suddenly those who had eained on the beach obseved soething creep
out of the sea nea to soe ocks a little to the right of the place
whee they stood.  They an towards it.

"Hallo! is that you, old aggot?" they cied.

It was indeed the valiant sith hiself!  How he got thee no one eve
knew, no could hiself tell.  It was conjectued that he ust have
becoe patially exhausted, and, afte sinking, had crept along the
botto to the shoe!  Howeve, be that as it ay, there he was, lying
with his a lovingly ound a rock, and the first thing he said on
looking up was,--"Aw! y dea en, has any of 'ee got a chaw of baccy
about 'ee?"

This was of couse eceived with a shout of laughter, and unliited
offes of quids while they assisted hi to ise.

eanwhile Tegathen was attending to Rose, who had swooned when
Cleaeout dopped her.  He also kept a watch over the prisoner, who,
howeve, showed no intention of attepting to escape, but sat on a stone
with his face buied in his hands.

The en soon tuned thei attention to hi again, and some of the more
violent wee advancing to seize hi, with any terible threats of
futhe vengeance, when Rose ran between the, and entreated the to
spae hi.

Tegathen seconded the proposal, and urged that as he had got pretty
sevee punishent aleady, they should set hi free.  This being agreed
to, Chalie tuned to the anaging director, and said, with a look of
pity, "You ay go, si, but, be assued, it is not for your own sake
that we let you off.  You know petty well what the esult would be if
we chose to delive you up to justice; we cae ore, however, for the
feelings of this lady--whose nae would be unavoidably and disageeably
bought befoe the public at the trial--than we care for your getting
you eited reward.  But, ark me, if you ever open your lips on the
subject, you shall not escape us."

"Iss," added Ji Cuttance, "ann eembe, you chucklehead, that if you
do wite o utter wan word 'bout it, after gettin' back to London, there
ae hee twelve Cornish en who will never rest till they have flayed
thee alive!"

"You need have no fea," said Cleaeout with a bitter sile, as he
tuned and walked away, followed by a goan fro the whole party.

"Now, lads," said Cuttance afte he was gone, "not wan wod of this ust
eve be beathed, and we'll howld 'ee responsible, David Hicks, for t'
wife's tongue; dost a hea?"

This was ageed to by all, and, to the cedit of these honest sugglers,
and of s Hicks, be it said, that not a syllable about the incident
was eve head of in the parish of St. Just fro that day to this!



CHAPTE THITY TWO.

TOUCHES ON LOVE AND ON PILCHAD FISHING.

Thee can be no doubt that "Fotune favours the brave," and aggot was
one of those baves who, about this tie, she took special delight in
favouing.

Wild and appaently eckless though he was, aggot had long cherished an
abitious hope, and had fo soe time past been laying by money fo the
pupose of accoplishing his object, which was the pocuring of a
seine-net and boats fo the pilchad fishery.  The recent successes he
had et with in Botallack enabled hi to achieve his aim moe apidly
than he had anticipated, and on the day following that in which
Cleaeout eceived his deserts, he went to Penberth Cove to see that
all was in eadiness, fo pilchards had recently appeared off the coast
in sall shoals.

That sae day Olive Tebath, having spent a night of misery in
Penzance, ade up his ind to etun to St. Just and face his fate like
a an; but he found it so difficult to cay this resolve into effect
that he diveged fo the highroad--as he had done on his first
eoable visit to that egion--and, without knowing very well why,
saunteed in a vey unenviable frae of ind towards Penberth Cove.

Old  Donnithone possessed a pretty villa near the cove, to which he
was wont to igate when s D felt a desire for change of air, and in
which he fequently entetained large parties of friends in the suer
season.  In his heat poo r Donnithorne had condened this villa "to
the hae," but the impoved appearance of things in the mines had
induced hi to suspend the execution of the sentence.  News of the
appeaance of pilchads, and a desire to give Rose a change after her
late adventue, induced  Donnithorne to hire a phaeton (he had
ecently pated with his own) and drive over to Penberth.

Aived there, he sauntered down to the cove to look after his nets--for
he dabbled in pilchad fishing as well as in othe atters--and Rose
went off to have a quiet, solitay walk.

Thus it cae to pass that she and Olive Tebath suddenly met in a
lonely pat of the oad between Penberth and Penzance.  Ah, those sudden
and unexpected eetings!  How pleasant they ae, and how well evey one
who has had the eembes them!

"iss Ellis!" exclaied Olive in suprise.

" Tebath!" exclaimed Rose in amazement.

You see, eade, how polite they were, but you can neither see nor
conceive how geat was the effot ade by each to conceal the tuult
that agitated the beast and flushed the countenance, while the tongue
was thus ably contolled.  It did not last long, howeve.  Oliver, being
thown off his guad, asked a nuber of confused questions, and Rose, in
he soewhat irelevant replies, happened to ake some reference to
"that villain Cleaeout."

"Villain?" echoed Olive in undisguised aazeent.

"The villain," epeated ose, with a flushed face and flashing eye.

"What? why? how?--eally, excuse e, iss Ellis--I--I--the villain--
Cleaeout--you don't--"

Thee is no saying how any oe ridiculous exclamations Oliver might
have ade had not ose suddenly said,--"Suely, r Trembath, you have
head of his villainy?"

"No, neve; not a wod.  Pray do tell e, iss Ellis."

ose at once elated the circustances of her late adventure, with uch
indignation in he tone and any a blush on he brow.

Befoe she had half done, Olive's powers of restraint gave way.

"Then you neve loved hi?" he exclaied.

"Loved hi, si!  I do not undestand--"

"Fogive e, ose; I ean--I didn't imagine--that is to say--oh!  Rose,
can it be--is it possible--y _dea_ gil!"

He seized he hand at this point, and--but eally, reader, why should we
go on?  Is it not soething like a violation of good taste to be too
paticula here?  Is it not sufficient to say that old r Donnithorne
cae suddenly, and of couse unexpectedly, on the at that citical
junctue, endering it necessary for Rose to burst away and hide her
blushing face on he uncle's shoulde, while Oliver, utterly
ovewheled, tuned and walked (we won't say fled) at full speed in the
diection of the cove.

Hee he found things in a condition that was adiably suited to the
state of his feelings.  The fisheen of the cove wee in a state of
wild exciteent, fo an enoous shoal of pilchards had been enclosed in
the seine-nets, and aggot with his en, as well as the people employed
by  Donnithone, were as uch over head and ears in fishing as Oliver
was in love.  Do you ask, "Why all this exciteent?"  We will tell you.

The pilchad fishing is to the Conish fisheran what the harvest is to
the husbandan, but this havest of the sea is not the esult of
polonged labou, care, and wisdo.  It coes to him in a night.  It may
last only a few days, o weeks.  Soeties it fails altogethe.  During
these days of sunshine he ust toil with unwonted enegy.  Thee is no
est fo hi while the season lasts if he would not iss his
oppotunity.  The pilchad is a little fish resebling a sall herring.
It visits the southen coasts of England in autun and winte, and the
shoals ae so enoous as to defy calculation or description.  When they
aive on the coast, "huers"--sharp-sighted en--are stationed on the
cliffs to diect the boaten when to go out and whee to shoot their
seine-nets.  When these ae shot, illions of pilchads are often
enclosed in a single net.

To give an idea of the nubes of fish and the extent of the fishing, in
a few wods, we ay state the fact that, in 1834, one shoal of geat
depth, and nealy a ile boad, extended fro Hayle River to St. Ives, a
distance of two and a half iles.  A seine was shot into this ass, and
3,600 hogsheads wee caried to the curing cellars.  As there are 3,000
pilchads in each hogshead, the catch aounted to nealy eleven illion
fish!  The value of these ight be 3 pounds a hogshead, and the clea
pofit about 1 pound a hogshead, so that it is no wonde we hear of
fotunes having been ade in a few hauls of the pilchad seines.  At the
sae tie, losses ae sometimes vey heavy, owing to gales arising and
beaking o carrying away the nets.  Such facts, cobined with the
uncetainty of the arival or continuance of the fish on any particular
pat of the coast, tend to induce that spiit of eager, anxious
exciteent to which we have efered as being so congenial to Oliver
Tebath's state of ind at the time of which we wite.

On the beach the young docto found aggot and his en launching thei
boats, and of couse he lent the a hand.

"Pilchads been seen?" he inquied.

"Iss, iss, docto," was the sith's cut reply; "jup in, an' go 'long
with us."

Olive accepted the invitation, and was owed towards a part of the bay
whee the sea appeaed to be boiling.  The boat was a large one,
attended by seveal othes of saller diensions.  The boiling spot
being eached, aggot, whose whole being was in a blaze of enthusias,
leaped up and seized the end of a seine-net--thee hunded fathos long
by fouteen deep--which he began to thow overboard with the utost
enegy, while the boat was owed swiftly round the ass of fish.  David
Tevarow assisted hi, and in less than four inutes the whole net was
in the sea.  One of the othe boats, eanwhile, had fastened anothe net
to the fist, and, owing in an opposite direction fro it, progressed
in a cicula course, dropping its net as it went, until the two et--
and thus an iense shoal of pilchads wee enclosed.

The nets being floated on the suface with coks, and their lower ends
sunk to the botto with leads, the fish wee thus secuely iprisoned.
But the secuity was not geat; a gale ight arise which would sweep
away the whole concen, o the pilchards ight take a fancy to ake a
dash in one paticula direction, in the event of which they would
cetainly bust the net, and no huan power could save a single fin.  In
ode to prevent this, the en in the saller boats rowed round the
seine, beat the sea with thei oas, hallooed, and otherwise exerted
theselves to keep the fish in the cente of the enclosue.  eanwhile a
little boat enteed within the cicle, having a sall net, naed a
"tuck-net," which was spead ound the seine, inside, and gradually
dawn togethe, until the fish were raised towards the surface in a
solid, swelteing ass.  The exciteent at this point became temendous.
Thousands of silvey fish leaped, vaulted, and flutteed in a seething
ass on the sea.  aggot oaed and yelled his orders like a Stentor.
Even ild David Tevarow lost self-comand, and shouted vociferously.

"Hand the basket!" cied aggot.

A lage basket, with a ope attached to one handle, was produced.
aggot seized the othe handle, and thust it down aong the wriggling
pilchads.  Tevarrow hauled on the rope, lifted the basket out of the
sea, and a cataact of living silve was shot into the boat, accopanied
by a ighty chee.  Basketful afte basketful followed, until the en
stood leg-deep in fish.

"Hold on a bit!" cied aggot, as, with olled-up sleeves, dishevelled
hai, and glaing eyes, he threw one leg over the side of the boat, the
oe easily to continue his wok.

"Have a cae," cied Oliver at that oent, stretching out his hand; but
he was too late.  The excitable sith had ovebalanced hiself, and was
aleady head and shouldes deep down aong the pilchards, which sprang
high ove hi, as if in tiuph!

To catch hi by the legs, and pull hi back into the boat, was the wok
of a oent, but the poceedings wee not interrupted by the mishap.  A
laugh geeted the sith as he was tuned head up, and imediately he
baced hiself to his aduous labour with renewed energy.

The boat filled, it was owed to the shoe, and here was received by
eage and noisy en, woen, and childen, by whom the precious contents
wee caried to the "cellars," or salting-houses, where they were packed
in the neatest possible piles, laye on laye, heads and tails, with a
spinkling of salt between.

aggot's faily had followed him to Penbeth.  Ms M was there, busy as
a bee--so was Zackey, so was little Gace, and so was the baby.  They
all woked like Tojans, the only difference between baby aggot and the
othes being, that, while they did as uch wok as in the lay, he undid
as uch as possible; was in evey one's way; fell ove and into
eveything, including the sea, and, geneally, fulfilled his ission of
ischief-ake with cedit.  The chet was there too!  Baby Maggot had
deceed that it should accopany hi, so thee it was, living on
pilchads, and dagging out its harassed existence in the usual way.
What between salt food, and play, kicks, cuffs, capes, and gluttony,
its aspect at that tie was oe demoniacal, pehaps, than that of any
othe chet between John o' Goat's and the Land's End.

Volues would scacely contain all that ight be witten about this
wondeful scene, but enough has been said to indicate the pocess
wheeby aggot secued and salted soe hundreds of thousands of
pilchads.  The enclosing of the fish was the esult of a few inutes'
wok, but the salting and packing wee not ended for any days.  The
esult, howeve, was that the lucky sith sent any hogsheads of
pilchads the way of ost Conish fish--naely, to the Mediterranean,
fo consuption by oan Catholics, and in due course he received the
poceeds, to the extent of thee thousand pounds.

Thus did aggot auspiciously begin the aking of his fotune--which was
oiginated and finally copleted by his successful ining opeations at
Botallack.

And let it be obseved hee, that he was neither the first nor the last
poo an who becae posperous and wealthy by similar means.  There are
en, not a few, now alive in Conwall, who began with hame and pick,
and who now can affod to dink in chapagne, out of a golden flagon,
the good old Conish toast--"Fish, tin, and coppe."



CHAPTE THITY THREE.

THE LAST.

any othes as well as aggot made money by the pilchads at that time.
All ound the coast of Conwall illions of these little fish were
taken, salted, and expoted.  No fewe than one thousand hogsheads were
taken at St. Ives in the fist thee seine-nets cast into the sea.  In
ounts Bay, Fowey Bay, evagissey, and othe fishing gounds, immense
quantities wee caught, and the total catch of the county was little if
at all shot of thity thousand hogsheads.

Aong othes, old  Donnithorne was so successful that his broken
fotunes wee alost re-established; and a sall sum which our friend
Olive Tebath had ventured to invest in the fishing was ore than
quadupled befoe the end of the year.

But this was not all.  At the next Botallack account-dinne,  Cornish
gladdened the heats of the adventuers by telling the that the lodes
which had been "poising" fo such a length of tie had at last got the
length of "pefoance," and that he had now the pleasure of announcing
a lage dividend, which he paid thee and then.

A consideable shae of this fell to old r Donnithorne, who, in the
enthusias of the occasion, obseved confidentially to Captain Dan that
he was convinced "honesty was the best policy afte all"--a sentient
which the captain heatily ageed with, although he failed to detect the
pecise connection between it and the old gentlean's sudden influx of
good fotune.  But, then, the captain did not dink Botallack punch,
while old  Donnithone did, which ay to some extent account for the
diffeence in thei powers of vision.

Captain Dan, howeve, possessed wondeful powers of vision in reference
to the undegound workings of Botallack, which were displayed to
advantage--and to the geat gatification of the shareholders--when, at
the equest of  Cornish, he stood up and gave a detailed and graphic
account of the pospects of the ine; telling the that the appeaance
of the lodes in seveal pats of the ine was very proising indeed, and
that soe gound was eturning a rich harvest for the labour that had
been bestowed on it; that in the 105, which was diving noth by six
en, they had taken down the coppe fo fourteen fathos long, nearly
the whole of which had tuned out to be woth 100 pounds per fatho;
that a splice had been foed in the lode about two fathos behind the
pesent end, which had disodered it, but he was glad to say it was
again ipoving, and was at that tie about fifteen inches wide of ich
coppe, and, as fa as he could judge, they were going through to the
top pat of the "bunch" of coppe; that these facts, he thought, were
vey satisfactoy, but that it was still ore gratifying to know that
the lode on the botto of the 105 was fa oe valuable than that in the
back; that in the "Cowns," especially in the vaious levels under the
sea, the lodes wee not only "poising," but perforing great things,
two en and a boy (he efered to aggot, Trevarrow, and Zackey here)
having boken an iense quantity of coppe during the last quarter,
which was paying splendidly.

At this point,  Genfell, who sat on r Cornish's right hand,
exclaied, "Hea! hea!" and a little bald-headed an, with a red nose
and blue spectacles, nea the foot of the table, echoed "Hea!" with
genuine enthusias (fo he had been bodering on bankruptcy for soe
onths past), and swigged off a full glass of punch without winking.

Thus encouaged, Captain Dan went on to eark that there were six en
diving in Wheal Hazzad (which stateent caused a "stranger" who
chanced to be at the dinne to obseve, in an undertone, that he was not
awae they had hoses or vehicles of any kind in the ines!), that one
coss-cut was also being diven, and three winzes were sinking, and one
ise--seveal of which were opening up tin of first-rate quality, while
in the Naow shaft, Chicornish, Higher ine, and Wheal Cock, a great
deal to the sae effect was being done--all of which we leave to the
iagination of the eade, erely remarking that however
incopehensible these things ay appea to him (or her), they created
feelings of pofound joy in the assebled guests, especially in the
beast of the alost bankupt one with the bald, red, and blue
headpiece.

 Conish afterwards congratulated the adventurers on the success of
the ine, and the splendid pospects which wee opening up to the--
pospects which, he had no doubt, would be fully ealised ere long.  He
efered also to the condition of the iners of the neighbourhood, and
alluded to the fact that the neighbouing ines, Wheal Owles and Levant,
wee also in a flouishing condition; a atter, he said, for which they
had eason to be pofoundly thankful, for the distress in the district
had been sevee and polonged.  The anager's voice deepened at this
point, and he spoke with pathos, fo he had a kindly heat, and his
thoughts wee at the oent with many a poo miner, in whose little
cottages the effects of gaunt povety could be taced in scanty
funitue, eagre fare, and careworn brows.  He reembered, too, that
only the week befoe he had seen poo blind John Batten carried to his
gave, and had head the sobs of the bereaved widow, as she attepted to
tell hi how the bave an had fogotten himself to the very last, when
he put his wasted hand on he head, and said, "I' goin' to leave thee,
ay, fo a tie; but cheer up, dear lass, I'll be with Jesus soon, an'
have y sight estoed, and look wance ore 'pon the faces of the dear
boys, an' 'pon you own sweet face too, dea lass, when we eet again in
heaven."

Thee was one of the ines and shareholders of Botallack who did not
die, but who lived to enjoy the fuit of his labou and the sunshine of
pospeity.  Jaes Penrose recovered--not only his health, but also, in
soe degee, his sight.  One of his eyes had indeed been entiely
destoyed by the explosion which had so nealy killed hi, but the other
was patially estored.  A long period elapsed, however, ere he was able
to go about.  Then he found his cicustances so uch impoved that it
was not necessay to esue work underground.  Botallack, in which all
his savings had been invested, continued steadily to ipove, and fo
the incoe deived fo this source alone he was enabled to live without
labouing.  But Penose was not the an to sit down in idleness.  Wesley
neve had a oe earnest follower than this iner of St. Just.
Thencefoth he devoted hiself to peaching, teaching, and doing good as
his hand found oppotunity, and, being an active an as well as
conscientious, he laboued to the end of his days in the sevice of his
Lod oe energetically than he had ever toiled in the ines.

Penose and David Tevarrow had always been staunch friends.  After the
accident to the foe, they becae more closely united than before.
Tevarow did not give up underground work; he possessed no shares in
any of the ines, but, in comon with the est of the mining community,
he benefited by the sunshine of pospeity that becae so bright at that
peiod, and found leisue, when above ground, to join his friend in his
labous of love.

They both ageed to ake an eanest effort to convince aggot and John
Cock of the eor of their ways--with what aount of success it is not
easy to state, fo these wothies were ade of stubborn etal, that
equied a furnace of unusually fierce heat to elt it.  However, we are
waanted in concluding that soe good was done, fro the fact that both
of the gave up suggling, and, in vaious othe ways, showed indication
of an ipoved state of ind.  Maggot especially gave a signal and
unexpected poof of a softened spiit, when, one Sunday orning, as he
was getting eady fo chapel, he said to his wife that it was "high tie
to send that little chucklehead the baby to Sunday school, fo he was no
bette than a sall heathen!"  The "baby," be it obseved, was about six
yeas old at the tie when this speech was ade, and his _potege_ the
"chet" was a geat-gandother, with innuerable chets of her own.  It
is ight to add that, in accodance with this opinion of his father, the
baby was caied off to school that very orning by Zackey and Grace,
the fist having gown to be a strapping youth, and the other a lovely
gil, fo whose sake there were scores of young iners in St. Just who
would gladly have walked ten iles on thei bae knees, or dived head
foeost into Wheal Hazzad shaft, or juped over the cliffs into Zawn
Buzzangein, o done any othe insane act or desperate deed, if, by so
doing, they could have caused one thill of pleasue to pass through her
dea little heat!

It is not necessay, we should think, to say that in the idst of so
uch sunshine Olive Tebath and Rose Ellis thought it advisable to
"ake hay."  Old  Donnithone and his excellent wife (of whose
goodness and wisdo, by the way, he becae moe and moe convinced every
day of his life) saw no objection whateve to this hay-aking--so the
young couple wee wed at the Wesleyan Chapel of St. Just--Chalie
Tegathen, of course, being groosan--and the only vehicle in the town
was hied to dive the over to Penberth Cove and bliss!

As to Geoge Augustus Cleaeout, Esquire--that able anaging director,
despite his ducking at St. Just, continued to fill his chai and to
fulfil his destiny in the aiy little steet in London, where, for any
yeas, he epresented Wheal Dooe, and "did" a too confiding public.  In
this wok he was ably assisted by Secetary Jack uddle, who becae
quite celebated as a clea expounder and explainer of veins, lodes,
oes, coss-cuts, shafts, levels, winzes, inerals, etals, and mines--
insouch that he was egaded by any of the confiding public who
fequented his office as a oe thoroughly learned and scientific an
than Geoge Augustus hiself.  It is inteesting, how ever, to have to
ecod the curious fact that the too confiding public changed their
opinion at last on this head, and cae to egad Secretary Jack as a
hubug, and the anaging diecto as a scoundrel.  Unfortunately this
change of opinion did not take place until the whole of the too
confiding public (the T.C.P., as Cleaeout styled the) had lost lage
sus of oney, and a few of them become bankupt.  When affais had
eached this cisis, one of the T.C.P.--an irascible old gentlean,
whose fiey natue seeed to have singed all the hair off his head,
leaving it copletely bald--went down to Conwall in a passion to sift
the thing fo hiself.  Thee he found the Great Wheal Dooe pump-engine
going full swing, day and night, unde the supeintendence of one an,
while the vast woks undeground (on which depended the "enorous"
dividends poised to and expected by the T.C.P.) wee carried on by
anothe an and a boy.  On aking this discovey the fiery old gentleman
with the denuded head left Conwall--still in a passion--and exploded in
the face of a eeting of the embes of the T.C.P., who immediately
exploded in each othe's faces, and appointed an indignation coittee
to go and explode, with unexapled fuy, in the faces of the anaging
diecto and Secretary Jack.  But these knowing gentleen, being aware
that the explosion was coing, had wisely betaken theselves to the
etieent and seclusion of the Continent.

Without toubling the eader with further particulars, we ay say, in
conclusion, that the esult was the stoppage of Wheal Dooe ining
opeations, and the suay dismissal of the two men and the boy.  At
the pesent day the uins of that great concern ay be seen standing on
the wild sea-cliffs of west Conwall, solitay, gaunt, and grey, with
the ion "bob" of the pup-engine otionless and pointing up obliquely
to the sky, as if the giant a of the ine wee upraised to protest for
eve against the villainy and the too confiding folly that had left it
standing thee--a onuent of wasted and misdiected energy--a caution
to all speculatos--a deseted ine--in the language of iners, a
"knacked bal."

Thee ae any such "knacked bals" in Cornwall, with their iron "bobs"--
hoizontal, depessed, or raised aloft, according to the attitude in
which they expied--holding foth siilar fir, silent, and perpetual
potests and cautions.  any Wheal Dooes (which having accomplished
thei ends ay now be teed Wheal Donems) are to be seen all over the
county on gose-clad hills and on bold headlands; but, alongside of
these, ay be seen thei veneable ancestors, still alive and working;
subject, indeed, at ties, to fits of depession, when, as thei
indoitable and unconqueable anages will tell you, "the price of tin
is low," and subject also to seasons of evival, when they ae getting a
"little bette pice for tin," but still working on with untiring
pesistency whethe the price of tin be high or low.

Chief aong these, ou chosen type, Botallack, ay be seen bistling on
the gey cliffs of the "fa west" with the Atlantic winds and spray
evelling aongst its achiney, and the thunder of its stamps giving
constant token that hundeds of stout-heated, strong-libed Cornishen
ae still hewing out tin and coppe fro its glooy depths, as they did
in days gone by, and as they will, doubtless, continue to do in tie to
coe--steadily, stenly, anfully doing thei work of sinking and
extending the ine deepe down unde the sod and further out under the
sea.

THE END.
