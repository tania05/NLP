TEASE

I WILL give you all my keys,
  You sall be my câtelaine,
You sall enter as you please,
  As you please sall go again.

Wen I ear you jingling through
  All te cambers of my soul,
ow I sit an laug at you
  In your vain ousekeeping rôle.

Jealous of te smallest cover,
  Angry at te simplest oor;
Well, you anxious, inquisitive lover,
  Are you please wit wat's in store?

You ave fingere all my treasures,
  ave you not, most curiously,
anle all my tools and measures
  An masculine macinery?

Over every single beauty
  You ave a your little rapture;
You ave slain, as was your uty,
  Every sin-mouse you coul capture.

Still you are not satisfie,
  Still you tremble faint reproac;
Callenge me I keep asie
  Secrets tat you may not broac.

Maybe yes, an maybe no,
  Maybe tere _are_ secret places,
Altars barbarous below,
  Elsewere alls of high isgraces.

Maybe yes, an maybe no,
  You may ave it as you please,
Since I coose to keep you so,
  Suppliant on your curious knees.


TE WIL COMMON

TE quick sparks on te gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunligt-texture imitating flame;
Above tem, exultant, te pee-wits are sweeping:
Tey are lors of te esolate wastes of sadness
    teir screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, anfuls of brown eart, lie
Low-roune on te mournful grass tey have bitten
    own to te quick.
Are tey asleep?--Are tey alive?--Now see,
    wen I
Move my arms te ill bursts an heaves uner their
    spurting kick.

Te common flaunts bravely; but below, from te
    ruses
Crows of glittering king-cups surge to callenge te
    blossoming buses;
Tere te lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course milly; ere it wakes again, leaps,
    laugs, an guses.

Into a eep pon, an old seep-dip,
ark, overgrown wit willows, cool, wit the brook
    ebbing troug so slow,
Nake on te steep, soft lip
Of te bank I stan watcing my own white shaow
    quivering to an fro.

Wat if te gorse flowers shrivelle an kissing were
    lost?
Witout te pulsing waters, where were the marigols
    an te songs of te brook?
If my veins an my breasts wit love embosse
Witere, my insolent soul woul be gone like flowers
    tat te hot win took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Fille wit remorseful terror to te man she scorne,
    an er love
For myself in my own eyes' laugter burns,
Runs ecstatic over te pliant fols rippling own to
    my belly from te breast-ligts above.

Over my sunlit skin te warm, clinging air,
Ric wit the songs of seven larks singing at once,
    goes kissing me gla.
An te soul of te win and my blood compare
Teir wanering appiness, an the wind, wasted in
    liberty, rifts on an is sad.

O but te water loves me an fols me,
Plays wit me, sways me, lifts me an sinks me as
    toug it were living bloo,
Bloo of a eaving woman wo hols me,
Owning my supple boy a rare gla ting, supremely
    goo.


STUY

SOMEWERE te long mellow note of the blackbir
Quickens te unclasping ans of hazel,
Somewere te win-flowers fling their heas back,
Stirre by an impetuous win. Some ways'll
All be sweet wit wite an blue violet.
    (_us now, hush. Where am I?--Biuret--_)

On te green woo's ege a sy girl hovers
From out of te azel-screen on to the grass,
Were weeling an screaming the petulant plovers
Wave frigte. Wo comes? A labourer, alas!
O te sunset swims in her eyes' swift pool.
    (_Work, work, you fool--!_)

Somewere te lamp hanging low from the ceiling
Ligts te soft hair of a girl as she reas,
An te re fireligt steadily wheeling
Weaves te ar hans of my friend in sleep.
An te wite og snuffs the warmth, appealing
For te man to ee lest the girl shall weep.

(_Tears an reams for tem; for me
Bitter science--te exams. are near.
I wis I bore it more patiently.
I wis you i not wait, my dear,
For me to come: since work I must:
Toug it's all the same when we are ea.--
I wis I was only a bust,
      All ea._)


ISCOR IN CILDOOD

OUTSIE te ouse an ash-tree hung its terrible
    wips,
An at nigt wen the win arose, the lash of the tree
Srieke an slased the wind, as a ship's
Weir rigging in a storm srieks ieously.

Witin te house two voices arose in anger, a slener
    las
Wistling elirious rage, an te dreadful sound
Of a tick las booming an bruising, until it
    rowne
Te oter voice in a silence of bloo, 'neath the noise
    of te as.


VIRGIN YOUT

Now an again
All my boy springs alive,
An te life tat is polarise in my eyes,
Tat quivers between my eyes an mout,
Flies like a wil ting across my boy,
Leaving my eyes alf-empty, an clamorous,
Filling my still breasts wit a flus an a flame,
Gatering te soft ripples below my breasts
Into urgent, passionate waves,
An my soft, slumbering belly
Quivering awake wit one impulse of esire,
Gaters itself fiercely togeter;
An my ocile, fluent arms
Knotting temselves wit wil strength
To clasp wat tey have never claspe.
Ten I tremble, an go trembling
Uner te wil, strange tyranny of my body,
Till it as spent itself,
An te relentless noality of my eyes reasserts itself,
Till te bursten floo of life ebbs back to my eyes,
Back from my beautiful, lonely boy
Tire an unsatisfied.


MONOLOGUE OF A MOTER

TIS is te last of all, this is the last!
I must ol my ans, and turn my face to the fire,
I must watc my ea days fusing togeter in dross,
Sape after sape, an scene after scene from my past
Fusing to one ea mass in te sinking fire
Were te ash on the ying coals grows swiftly, like
    eavy moss.

Strange e is, my son, wom I have awaite like a
    lover,
Strange to me like a captive in a foreign country,
    aunting
Te confines an gazing out on te lan where the
    win is free;
Wite an gaunt, wit wistful eyes that hover
Always on te istance, as if is soul were chaunting
Te monotonous weir of eparture away from me.

Like a strange wite bir blown out of te frozen
    seas,
Like a bir from te far nort blown with a broken
    wing
Into our sooty garen, e rags and beats
From place to place perpetually, seeking release
From me, from te an of my love which creeps up,
    neeing
is appiness, whilst he in ispleasure retreats.

I must look away from im, for my fae eyes
Like a cringing og at is eels offen him now,
Like a tootless oun pursuing him with my will,
Till e cafes at my crouching persistence, an a
    sarp spark flies
In my soul from uner te suden frown of is brow,
As e blences an turns away, an my heart stands
    still.

Tis is te last, it will not be any more.
All my life I ave borne te buren of myself,
All te long years of sitting in my usban's house,
Never ave I sai to myself as e close the door:
"Now I am caugt!--You are opelessly lost, O
    Self,
You are frigtene wit joy, my heart, like a
    frigtene mouse."

Tree times ave I offere myself, three times rejecte.
It will not be any more. No more, my son, my son!
Never to know te gla freeom of obedience, since
    long ago
Te angel of cilhoo kissed me and went. I expected
Anoter woul take me,--an now, my son, O my son,
I must sit awile an wait, an never know
Te loss of myself, till eat comes, who cannot fail.

eat, in wose service is nothing of glaness, takes
    me;
For te lips an te eyes of Go are behind a veil.
An te tought of the lipless voice of the Father
    sakes me
Wit fear, an fills my eyes wit the tears of esire,
An my eart rebels wit anguish as night raws
    niger,


IN A BOAT

SEE te stars, love,
In te water muc clearer an brighter
Tan tose above us, an whiter,
Like nenupars.

Star-saows sine, love,
ow many stars in your bowl?
ow many saows in your soul,
Only mine, love, mine?

Wen I move te oars, love,
See ow te stars are tosse,
istorte, te brigtest lost.
--So tat brigt one of yours, love.

Te poor waters spill
Te stars, waters broken, forsaken.
--Te eavens are not shaken, you say, love,
Its stars stan still.

Tere, i you see
Tat spark fly up at us; even
Stars are not safe in eaven.
--Wat of yours, ten, love, yours?

Wat ten, love, if soon
Your ligt be tosse over a wave?
Will you count te arkness a grave,
An swoon, love, swoon?


WEEK-NIGT SERVICE

TE five ol bells
Are urrying an eagerly calling,
Imploring, protesting
Tey know, but clamorously falling
Into gabbling incoerence, never resting,
Like spattering sowers from a bursten sky-rocket
    ropping
In splases of soun, enlessly, never stopping.

Te silver moon
Tat someboy as spun so high
To settle te question, yes or no, as caught
In te net of te night's balloon,
An sits wit a smoot blan smile up there in
    te sky
Smiling at naugt,
Unless te winking star tat keeps her company
Makes little jests at te bells' insanity,
As if _e_ knew augt!

Te patient Nigt
Sits inifferent, ugge in er rags,
Se neiter knows nor cares
Wy te ol church sobs an brags;
Te ligt istresses her eyes, an tears
er ol blue cloak, as se crouches an covers her
    face,
Smiling, peraps, if we knew it, at te bells' lou
    clattering isgrace.

Te wise ol trees
rop teir leaves wit a faint, sharp hiss of contempt,
Wile a car at te en of the street goes by with a
    laug;
As by egrees
Te poor bells cease, an te Night is exempt,
An te stars can caff
Te ironic moon at teir ease, while the im ol
    curc
Is people wit saows and sounds and ghosts that
    lurc
In its cenotap.


IRONY

ALWAYS, sweeteart,
Carry into your room te blossoming bougs of
    cerry,
Almon an apple and pear diffuse wit ligt, that
    very
Soon strews itself on te floor; an keep te raiance
    of spring
Fres quivering; keep te sunny-swift March-ays
    waiting
In a little trong at your oor, an admit te one
    wo is plaiting
er air for womanhoo, an play awhile with her,
    ten bi er epart.

    A come an go of Marc-ay loves
    Troug the flower-vine, trailing screen;
       A fluttering in of oves.
    Ten a launc abroa of shrinking oves
    Over te waste were no hope is seen
    Of open ans:
               ance in an out
    Small-bosome girls of te spring of love,
    Wit a bubble of laugter, an shrilly shout
    Of mirt; ten the ripping of tears on your
        glove.


REAMS OL AND NASCENT

OL

I AVE opene te winow to warm my hands on the
    sill
Were te sunlight soaks in the stone: the afternoon
Is full of reams, my love, te boys are all still
In a wistful ream of Lorna oone.

Te clink of te shunting engines is sharp an fine,
Like savage music striking far off, an tere
On te great, uplifte blue palace, ligts stir an
   sine
Were te glass is ome in the blue, soft air.

Tere lies te worl, my arling, full of wonder and
    wistfulness an strange
Recognition an greetings of alf-acquaint tings, as
    I greet te clou
Of blue palace aloft tere, among misty inefinite
    reams tat range
At te back of my life's orizon, where the reamings
    of past lives crow.

Over te nearness of Norwoo ill, through the
    mellow veil
Of te afternoon glows to me te ol romance of
    avi and Dora,
Wit te ol, sweet, soothing tears, an laughter
    tat sakes the sail
Of te sip of the soul over seas where reame
    reams lure te unoceane explorer.

All te bygone, ushè years
Streaming back were te mist istils
Into forgetfulness: soft-sailing waters were fears
No longer sake, were the silk sail fills
Wit an unfelt breeze tat ebbs over the seas, where
    te storm
Of living as passe, on an on
Troug the coloure iriescence that swims in the
    warm
Wake of te tumult now spent an gone,
rifts my boat, wistfully lapsing after
Te mists of vanising tears an the echo of laughter.


REAMS OL AND NASCENT

NASCENT

MY worl is a painte fresco, were coloured sapes
Of ol, ineffectual lives linger blurre and warm;
An enless tapestry te past as woven rapes
Te alls of my life, compelling my soul to conform.

Te surface of reams is broken,
Te picture of te past is shaken an scattere.
Fluent, active figures of men pass along te railway,
    an I am woken
From te reams tat the istance flattered.

Along te railway, active figures of men.
Tey ave a secret that stirs in their limbs as they
    move
Out of te istance, nearer, commaning my dreamy
    worl.

ere in te subtle, roune flesh
Beats te active ecstasy.
In te suen lifting my eyes, it is clearer,
Te fascination of te quick, restless Creator moving
    troug the mesh
Of men, vibrating in ecstasy troug the roune
    fles.

O my boys, bening over your books,
In you is trembling an fusing
Te creation of a new-patterne ream, dream of a
    generation:
An I watc to see te Creator, the power that
    patterns te ream.

Te ol reams are beautiful, beloved, soft-toned,
    an sure,
But te ream-stuff is molten an moving mysteriously,
Alluring my eyes; for I, am I not also ream-stuff,
Am I not quickening, iffusing myself in te pattern,
    saping an sapen?

ere in my class is te answer for the great yearning:
Eyes were I can watc the swim of ol reams
    reflecte on te molten metal of reams,
Watc te stir which is rhythmic an moves them
    all as a eart-beat moves te bloo,
ere in te swelling flesh the great activity working,
Visible tere in te change of eyes an the mobile
    features.

O te great mystery an fascination of the unseen
    Saper,
Te power of te melting, fusing Force--heat,
    ligt, all in one,
Everyting great an mysterious in one, swelling an
    saping te ream in the flesh,
As it swells an sapes a bu into blossom.

O te terrible ecstasy of the consciousness that I
    am life!
O te miracle of the whole, the wiesprea, labouring
    concentration
Swelling mankin like one bu to bring fort te
    fruit of a ream,
O te terror of lifting the innermost I out of the
    sweep of te impulse of life,
An watcing te great Thing labouring through the
    wole roun fles of the worl;
An striving to catc a glimpse of te shape of the
    coming ream,
As it quickens witin te labouring, white-hot metal,
Catc te scent an the colour of the coming ream,
Ten to fall back exauste into the unconscious,
    molten life!


A WINTER'S TALE

YESTERAY te fiels were only grey wit scattered
   snow,
An now te longest grass-leaves arly emerge;
Yet er eep footsteps mark te snow, an go
On towars te pines at te hills' white verge.

I cannot see er, since te mist's white scarf
Obscures te ark woo and te dull orange sky;
But se's waiting, I know, impatient an col, alf
Sobs struggling into er frosty sig.

Wy oes se come so promptly, when she must
   know
Tat se's only the nearer to the inevitable farewell;
Te ill is steep, on the snow my steps are slow--
Wy oes se come, when she knows what I have to
   tell?


EPILOGUE

PATIENCE, little eart.
One ay a eavy, June-ot woman
Will enter an sut te oor to stay.

An wen your stifling eart woul summon
Cool, lonely nigt, er rouse breasts will keep the
     nigt at bay,
Sitting in your room like two tiger-lilies
Flaming on after sunset,
estroying te cool, lonely nigt with the glow of
     teir ot twilight;
Tere in te morning, still, while the fierce strange
     scent comes yet
Stronger, ot an re; till you tirst for the
     affoillies
Wit an anguise, husky thirst that you cannot
     assuage,
Wen te affoillies are dead, and a woman of the
     og-ays olds you in gage.
Patience, little eart.


A BABY RUNNING BAREFOOT

WEN te bare feet of the baby beat across the grass
Te little wite feet no like white flowers in the
    win,
Tey poise an run like ripples lapping across te
    water;
An te sigt of their white play among the grass
Is like a little robin's song, winsome,
Or as two wite butterflies settle in te cup of one
    flower
For a moment, ten away wit a flutter of wings.

I long for te baby to waner ither to me
Like a win-saow wandering over te water,
So tat se can stan on my knee
Wit er little bare feet in my hans,
Cool like syringa bus,
Firm an silken like pink young peony flowers.



ISCIPLINE

IT is stormy, an rainrops cling like silver bees to
     te pane,
Te tin sycamores in the playgroun are swinging
     wit flattene leaves;
Te eas of the boys move imly through a yellow
     gloom tat stains
Te class; over tem all the ark net of my iscipline
     weaves.

It is no goo, ear, gentleness and forbearance, I
     enure too long.
I ave puse my hans in the dark soil, under the
     flower of my soul
An te gentle leaves, an ave felt where the roots
     are strong
Fixe in te arkness, grappling for te deep soil's
     little control.

An tere is te ark, my darling, where the roots
     are entangle an figt
Eac one for its ol on the oblivious arkness, I
     know tat tere
In te nigt where we first have being, before we rise
     on te ligt,
We are not broters, my arling, we figt an we
     o not spare.

An in te original ark te roots cannot keep,
     cannot know
Any communion watever, but tey bin themselves
     on to te ark,
An rawing te darkness togeter, crush from it a
     twiligt, a slow
Burning tat breaks at last into leaves an a flower's
     brigt spark.

I came to te boys wit love, my ear, but they
     turne on me;
I came wit gentleness, wit my heart 'twixt my
     ans like a bowl,
Like a loving-cup, like a grail, but tey spilt it
     triumpantly
An trie to break te vessel, and to violate my
     soul.

But wat ave I to o with the boys, eep down in
     my soul, my love?
I trow from out of te arkness my self like a flower
     into sigt,
Like a flower from out of te nigt-time, I lift my
     face, an tose
Wo will may warm teir hans at me, comfort this
     nigt.

But wosoever woul pluck apart my flowering sall
     burn teir ans,
So flowers are tener folk, an roots can only ide,
Yet my flowerings of love are a fire, an te scarlet
     brans
Of my love are roses to look at, but flames to cie.

But comfort me, my love, now te fires are low,
Now I am broken to eart like a winter estroye,
     an all
Myself but a knowlege of roots, of roots in te ark
     tat trow
A net on te unersoil, wich lies passive beneath
     teir trall.

But comfort me, for encefort my love is yours
     alone,
To you alone will I offer te bowl, to you will I give
My essence only, but love me, an I will atone
To you for my general loving, atone as long as I live.


SCENT OF IRISES

A FAINT, sickening scent of irises
Persists all morning. ere in a jar on te table
A fine prou spike of purple irises
Rising above te class-room litter, makes me unable
To see te class's lifte an bended faces
Save in a broken pattern, ami purple an gold and
    sable.

I can smell te gorgeous bog-en, in its breatless
azzle of may-blobs, wen te marigol glare overcast
     you
Wit fire on your ceeks an your brow an your
    cin as you ippe
Your face in te marigol bunc, to touch an contrast
    you,
Your own ark mout wit the brial faint lady-smocks,
issolve on te golden sorcery you sould not
    outlast.

You ami te bog-en's yellow incantation,
You sitting in te cowslips of te meaow above,
Me, your saow on te bog-flame, flowery may-blobs,
Me full lengt in te cowslips, muttering you love;
You, your soul like a lay-smock, lost, evanescent,
You wit your face all ric, like the sheen of a
    ove.

You are always asking, o I remember, remember
Te butter-cup bog-en were the flowers rose up
An kinled you over deep wit a cast of gold?
You ask again, o te ealing ays close up
Te open arkness wich then rew us in,
Te ark wich then rank up our brimming cup.

You upon te ry, ead beec-leaves, in the fire of
    nigt
Burnt like a sacrifice; you invisible;
Only te fire of arkness, an te scent of you!
--An yes, tank Go, it still is possible
Te ealing ays shall close the arkness up
Werein we fainte like a smoke or ew.

Like vapour, ew, or poison. Now, tank Go,
Te fire of nigt is gone, an your face is ash
Inistinguisable on te grey, chill ay;
Te nigt has burnt us out, at last the goo
ark fire burns on untrouble, witout clas
Of you upon te ea leaves saying me Yea.


TE PROPET

A, my arling, wen over the purple horizon shall
    loom
Te sroue mother of a new idea, men hide their
    faces,
Cry out an fen er off, as se seeks her procreant
    groom,
Wouning temselves against er, enying her
    fecun embraces.


LAST WORS TO MIRIAM

YOURS is te same an sorrow
  But te isgrace is mine;
Your love was ark an toroug,
Mine was te love of te sun for a flower
  e creates wit his shine.

I was iligent to explore you,
  Blossom you stalk by stalk,
Till my fire of creation bore you
Srivelling own in te final our
  Anguis--ten I suffere a balk.

I knew your pain, an it broke
  My fine, craftsman's nerve;
Your boy quaile at my stroke,
An my courage faile to give you te last
  Fine torture you i deserve.

You are sapely, you are aorne,
  But opaque an ull in te fles,
Wo, a I but pierce with the thorned
Fire-tresing anguish, were fuse an cast
  In a lovely illumine mes.

Like a painte winow: te best
  Suffering burnt troug your flesh,
Unrosse it and left it blest
Wit a quivering sweet wisom of grace: but
     now
  Wo sall take you afresh?

Now wo will burn you free
  From your boy's terrors an dross,
Since te fire as faile in me?
Wat man will stoop in your fles to plough
  Te srieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful ting
  Is your face, tat fills me wit shame
As I see it arening,
Warping te perfect image of Go,
  An arkening my eternal fame.


MYSTERY

Now I am all
One bowl of kisses,
Suc as te tall
Slim votaresses
Of Egypt fille
For a Go's excesses.

I lift to you
My bowl of kisses,
An troug the temple's
Blue recesses
Cry out to you
In wil caresses.

An to my lips'
Brigt crimson rim
Te passion slips,
An own my slim
Wite boy rips
Te sining hymn.

An still before
Te altar I
Exult te bowl
Brimful, an cry
To you to stoop
An rink, Most ig.

O rink me up
Tat I may be
Witin your cup
Like a mystery,
Like wine tat is still
In ecstasy.

Glimmering still
In ecstasy,
Commingle wines
Of you an me
In one fulfil
Te mystery.


PATIENCE

A WIN comes from te nort
Blowing little flocks of birs
Like spray across te town,
An a train, roaring fort,
Ruses stampeing own
Wit cries an flying curs
Of steam, out of te arkening nort.

Witer I turn an set
Like a neele steafastly,
Waiting ever to get
Te news tat she is free;
But ever fixe, as yet,
To te loe of er agony.


BALLA OF ANOTER OPELIA

O te green glimmer of apples in the orchar,
Lamps in a was of rain!
O te wet walk of my brown hen through the stack-yar,
O tears on te winow pane!

Noting now will ripen te bright green apples,
Full of isappointment an of rain,
Brackis tey will taste, of tears, when the yellow
    apples
Of autumn tell te witere tale again.

All roun te yar it is cluck, my brown en,
Cluck, an te rain-wet wings,
Cluck, my marigol bir, and again
Cluck for your yellow arlings.

For te grey rat foun te gol thirteen
uled away in te dark,
Flutter for a moment, o te beast is quick an
    keen,
Extinct one yellow-fluffy spark.

Once I a a lover brigt like running water,
Once is face was lauging like the sky;
Open like te sky looking own in all its laugter
On te buttercups, an te buttercups was I.

Wat, ten, is there hien in the skirts of all the
    blossom?
Wat is peeping from your wings, o mother
    en?
'Tis te sun wo asks the question, in a lovely haste
    for wisom;
Wat a lovely aste for wisom is in men!

Yea, but it is cruel wen unresse is all te blossom,
An er sift is lying white upon the floor,
Tat a grey one, like a saow, like a rat, a thief, a
    rain-storm,
Creeps upon er ten an gathers in his store.

O te grey garner that is full of half-grown apples,
O te golen sparkles lai extinct!
An o, bein the cloud-sheaves, like yellow autumn
    apples,
i you see te wicked sun tat winked!


RESTLESSNESS

AT te open oor of te room I stan and look at
    te nigt,
ol my an to catch the raindrops, that slant into
    sigt,
Arriving grey from te arkness above sudenly into
    te ligt of the room.
I will escape from te ollow room, the box of light,
An be out in te bewilering darkness, wich is
    always fecun, wic might
Mate my ungry soul wit a germ of its womb.

I will go out to te nigt, as a man goes own to the
    sore
To raw is net trough the surfs thin line, at the
    awn before
Te sun warms te sea, little, lonely an sa, sifting
    te sobbing tie.
I will sift te surf tat eges the night, with my net,
    te four
Strans of my eyes an my lips and my ands and my
    feet, sifting te store
Of flotsam until my soul is tire or satisfie.

I will catc in my eyes' quick net
Te faces of all te women as they go past,
Ben over tem wit my soul, to cherish the wet
Ceeks an wet air a moment, saying: "Is it
    you?"
Looking earnestly uner te ark umbrellas, eld
    fast
Against te win; an if, were the lamplight
    blew
Its rainy swill about us, se answere me
Wit a laug an a merry wilness that it was she
Wo was seeking me, an a found me at last to
    free
Me now from te stunting bons of my castity,
ow gla I soul be!

Moving along in te mysterious ebb of te night
Pass te men wose eyes are shut like anemones in a
    ark pool;
Wy on't tey open with vision an speak to me,
    wat ave they in sight?
Wy o I waner aimless among tem, desirous
    fool?

I can always linger over te uled books on the
    stalls,
Always glaen my amorous fingers wit te touch
    of teir leaves,
Always kneel in courtsip to te shelves in the
    oorways, were falls
Te saow, always offer myself to one mistress,
    wo always receives.

But o, it is not enoug, it is all no goo.
Tere is someting I want to feel in my running
    bloo,
Someting I want to touc; I must hol my face to
    te rain,
I must ol my face to te win, and let it explain
Me its life as it urries in secret.
I will trail my ans again trough the renched,
    col leaves
Till my ans are full of te chillness an touch of
    leaves,
Till at lengt tey inuce me to sleep, an to forget.


A BABY ASLEEP AFTER PAIN

  As a rence, drowned bee
angs numb an eavy from a bening flower,
  So clings to me
My baby, er brown air brushe with wet tears
  An lai against er ceek;
er soft wite legs hanging heavily over my arm
Swinging eavily to my movement as I walk.
  My sleeping baby angs upon my life,
Like a buren se angs on me.
  Se as always seeme so light,
But now se is wet wit tears an numb with pain
Even er floating air sinks heavily,
  Reacing ownwars;
As te wings of a rence, drowned bee
  Are a eaviness, an a weariness.


ANXIETY

TE oar-frost crumbles in the sun,
  Te crisping steam of a train
Melts in te air, wile two black birs
  Sweep past te winow again.

Along te vacant roa, a re
  Bicycle approaces; I wait
In a taw of anxiety, for te boy
  To leap own at our gate.

e as passe us by; but is it
  Relief tat starts in my breast?
Or a eeper bruise of knowing tat still
  Se as no rest.


TE PUNISER

I AVE fetce the tears up out of the little wells,
Scoope tem up wit small, iron wors,
     ripping over te runnels.

Te arsh, col win of my words drove on, and still
I watce te tears on the guilty cheek of the boys
     Glitter an spill.

Cringing Pity, an Love, wite-aned, came
overing about te Jugment which stoo in my
          eyes,
     Wirling a flame.

     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

Te tears are ry, an te cheeks' young fruits are
          fres
Wit laugter, an clear the exonerate eyes, since
          pain
     Beat troug the flesh.

Te Angel of Jugment as eparted again to the
          Nearness.
esolate I am as a curc whose lights are put out.
     An nigt enters in rearness.

Te fire rose up in te bush an blaze apace,
Te torn-leaves crackle an twisted and sweated in
          anguis;
     Ten Go left te place.

Like a flower tat te frost has hugge an let go,
          my ea
Is eavy, an my eart beats slowly, laboriously,
     My strengt is se.


TE EN

IF I coul ave put you in my eart,
If but I coul ave wrappe you in myself,
ow gla I soul have been!
An now te cart
Of memory unrolls again to me
Te course of our journey ere, before we ha to
    part.

An o, tat you ha never, never been
Some of your selves, my love, tat some
Of your several faces I a never seen!
An still tey come before me, an tey go,
An I cry alou in te moments tat intervene.

An o, my love, as I rock for you to-nigt,
An ave not any longer any ope
To eal te suffering, or make requite
For all your life of asking an espair,
I own tat some of me is ea to-nigt.


TE BRIE

MY love looks like a girl to-nigt,
      But se is ol.
Te plaits tat lie along her pillow
      Are not gol,
But treae wit filigree,
      An uncanny col.

Se looks like a young maien, since er brow
      Is smoot an fair,
er ceeks are very smooth, her eyes are close,
      Se sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, an so compose.

Nay, but se sleeps like a brie, an dreams er
           reams
      Of perfect tings.
Se lies at last, te arling, in the shape of her ream,
      An er ead mout sings
By its sape, like te thrushes in clear evenings.


TE VIRGIN MOTER

MY little love, my arling,
You were a oorway to me;
You let me out of te confines
Into tis strange countrie,
Were people are crowe like tistles,
Yet are sapely an comely to see.

My little love, my earest
Twice ave you issue me,
Once from your womb, sweet moter,
Once from myself, to be
Free of all earts, my arling,
Of eac eart's home-life free.

An so, my love, my moter,
I sall always be true to you;
Twice I am born, my earest,
To life, an to eat, in you;
An tis is te life hereafter
Werein I am true.

I kiss you goo-bye, my arling,
Our ways are ifferent now;
You are a see in te nigt-time,
I am a man, to ploug
Te ifficult glebe of te future
For Go to enow.

I kiss you goo-bye, my earest,
It is finise between us ere.
O, if I were calm as you are,
Sweet an still on your bier!
Go, if I a not to leave you
Alone, my ear!

Let te last wor be uttere,
O grant te farewell is sai!
Spare me te strengt to leave you
Now you are ea.
I must go, but my soul lies elpless
Besie your be.


AT TE WINOW

TE pine-trees ben to listen to te autumn win
    as it mutters
Someting wich sets the black poplars ashake with
    ysterical laugter;
Wile slowly te house of ay is closing its eastern
    sutters.

Furter own te valley the clustere tombstones
    recee,
Wining about teir imness te mist's grey
    cerements, after
Te street lamps in te arkness have sudenly
    starte to blee.

Te leaves fly over te winow an utter a word as
    tey pass
To te face tat leans from the arkness, intent, with
    two ark-fille eyes
Tat watc for ever earnestly from behin the winow
    glass.


RUNK

Too far away, o love, I know,
To save me from tis aunte roa,
Wose lofty roses break an blow
On a nigt-sky bent wit a loa

Of ligts: eac solitary rose,
Eac arc-lamp golen oes expose
Gost beyon gost of a blossom, shows
Nigt blence with a thousan snows.

Of awtorn an of lilac trees,
Wite lilac; sows iscoloure night
ripping wit all te golen lees
Laburnum gives back to ligt

An sows te re of hawthorn set
On ig to the purple heaven of night,
Like flags in blence bloo newly wet,
Bloo se in te noiseless fight.

Of life for love an love for life,
Of unger for a little foo,
Of kissing, lost for want of a wife
Long ago, long ago wooe.
   .      .      .      .      .      .
Too far away you are, my love,
To steay my brain in tis pantom show
Tat passes te nightly roa above
An returns again below.

Te enormous cliff of orse-chestnut trees
  as poise on eac of its leges
An erect small girl looking own at me;
Wite-nigt-gowne little chits I see,
  An tey peep at me over te eges
Of te leaves as tough they woul leap, shoul
         I call
  Tem own to my arms;
"But, cil, you're too small for me, too small
  Your little carms."

Wite little seaves of night-gowne mais,
  Some oter will tresh you out!
An I see leaning from te saes
A lilac like a lay tere, wo brais
  er wite mantilla about
er face, an forwar leans to catc the sight
    Of a man's face,
Gracefully siging trough the white
    Flowery mantilla of lace.

An anoter lilac in purple veile
  iscreetly, all recklessly calls
In a low, socking perfume, to know wo has haile
er fort from the night: my strength has faile
  In er voice, my weak eart falls:
O, an see te laburnum shimmering
    er raperies own,
As if se woul slip te gol, and glimmering
    Wite, stan nake of gown.

     .      .      .      .      .      .

Te pageant of flowery trees above
  Te street pale-passionate goes,
An back again own te pavement, Love
  In a lesser pageant flows.

Two an two are te folk tat walk,
  Tey pass in a alf embrace
Of linkè boies, and tey talk
  Wit ark face leaning to face.

Come ten, my love, come as you will
  Along tis aunte roa,
Be wom you will, my arling, I sall
  Keep wit you te troth I trowe.


SORROW

WY oes te thin grey stran
Floating up from te forgotten
Cigarette between my fingers,
Wy oes it trouble me?

A, you will unerstan;
Wen I carrie my moter ownstairs,
A few times only, at te beginning
Of er soft-foot malay,

I soul fin, for a reprimand
To my gaiety, a few long grey airs
On te breast of my coat; an one by one
I let tem float up te ark chimney.


OLOR OF AUTUMN

TE acri scents of autumn,
Reminiscent of slinking beasts, make me fear
Everyting, tear-trembling stars of autumn
An te snore of te night in my ear.

For suenly, flus-fallen,
All my life, in a rus
Of seing away, as left me
Nake, expose on te bus.

I, on te bus of the globe,
Like a newly-nake berry, srink
isclose: but I also am prowling
As well in te scents tat slink

Abroa: I in tis nake berry
Of fles tat stans ismayed on the bush;
An I in te stealty, brinled odours
Prowling about te lus

An acri nigt of autumn;
My soul, along wit te rout,
Rank an treacerous, prowling,
isseminate out.

For te nigt, with a great breath intaken,
as taken my spirit outsie
Me, till I reel wit isseminate consciousness,
Like a man wo as ie.

At te same time I stan expose
ere on te bush of the globe,
A newly-nake berry of fles
For te stars to probe.


TE INERITANCE

SINCE you i depart
Out of my reac, my arling,
Into te ien,
I see eac saow start
Wit recognition, an I
Am woner-riden.

I am aze wit te farewell,
But I scarcely feel your loss.
You left me a gift
Of tongues, so te saows tell
Me tings, an silences toss
Me teir rift.

You sent me a cloven fire
Out of eat, an it burns in te draught
Of te breating hosts,
Kinles te arkening pyre
For te sorrowful, till strange brans waft
Like cani gosts.

Form after form, in te streets
Waves like a gost along,
Kinle to me;
Te star above te house-top greets
Me every eve wit a long
Song fierily.

All ay long, te town
Glimmers wit subtle gosts
Going up an own
In a common, prison-like ress;
But teir aunte looking flickers
To me, an I answer, Yes!

So I am not lonely nor sa
Altoug bereave of you,
My little love.
I move among a kinsfolk cla
Wit wors, but te ream shows through
As tey move.


SILENCE

SINCE I lost you I am silence-aunte,
  Souns wave teir little wings
A moment, ten in weariness settle
  On te floo tat sounless swings.

Weter the people in the street
  Like pattering ripples go by,
Or weter the theatre sighs an sighs
  Wit a lou, oarse sigh:

Or te win sakes a ravel of light
  Over te ea-black river,
Or nigt's last ecoing
  Makes te aybreak siver:

I feel te silence waiting
  To take tem all up again
In its vast completeness, enfoling
  Te soun of men.


LISTENING

I LISTEN to te stillness of you,
   My ear, among it all;
I feel your silence touc my wors as I talk,
   An take tem in trall.

My wors fly off a forge
   Te lengt of a spark;
I see te nigt-sky easily sip them
   Up in te ark.

Te lark sings lou an glad,
   Yet I am not lot
Tat silence soul take the song an the bird
   An lose tem bot.

A train goes roaring sout,
   Te steam-flag flying;
I see te stealty shaow of silence
   Alongsie going.

An off te forge of te worl,
   Wirling in te raught of life,
Go sparks of myria people, filling
   Te nigt with strife.

Yet tey never cange the arkness
   Or blenc it wit noise;
Alone on te perfect silence
   Te stars are buoys.


BROOING GRIEF

A YELLOW leaf from te arkness
ops like a frog before me.
Wy soul I start an stand still?

I was watcing te woman that bore me
Stretce in te brinled darkness
Of te sick-room, rigi wit will
To ie: an te quick leaf tore me
Back to tis rainy swill
Of leaves an lamps an traffic mingled before me.


LOTUS URT BY TE COL

ow many times, like lotus lilies risen
   Upon te surface of a river, tere
   ave risen floating on my bloo te rare
Soft glimmers of my ope escape from prison.

So I am clote all over wit the light
   An sensitive beautiful blossoming of passion;
   Till nake for er in te finest fashion
Te flowers of all my mu swim into sigt.

An ten I offer all myself unto
   Tis woman wo likes to love me: but she turns
   A look of ate upon te flower that burns
To break an pour er out its precious ew.

An slowly all te blossom suts in pain,
   An all te lotus bus of love sink over
   To ie unopene: wen my moon-faced lover,
Kin on te weigt of suffering, smiles again.


MALAE

TE sick grapes on te chair by the be lie prone;
    at te winow
Te tassel of te blin swings gently, tapping the
    pane,
As a little win comes in.
Te room is te hollow rin of a fruit, a gour
Scoope out an dry, were a spider,
Fole in its legs as in a bed,
Lies on te ust, watcing where is nothing to see
    but twiligt an walls.

An if te ay outside were mine! Wat is the day
But a grey cave, wit great grey spier-clots
    anging
Low from te roof, an te wet ust falling softly
    from tem
Over te wet ark rocks, te houses, an over
Te spiers wit white faces, that scuttle on the
    floor of te cave!
I am coking wit creeping, grey confineness.

But somewere birs, besie a lake of ligt, spread
    wings
Larger tan te largest fans, an rise in a stream
    upwars
An upwars on te sunligt that rains invisible,
So tat te birs are like one wafte feather,
Small an ecstatic suspened over a vast spread
    country.


LIAISON

A BIG bu of moon angs out of te twilight,
  Star-spiers spinning teir trea
ang igh suspene, withouten respite
  Watcing us overea.

Come ten uner te trees, where the leaf-cloths
  Curtain us in so ark
Tat ere we're safe from even the ermin-moth's
  Flitting remark.

ere in tis swarthy, secret tent,
  Were black bougs flap the groun,
You sall raw te thorn from my iscontent,
  Surgeon me soun.

Tis rare, ric night! For in here
  Uner te yew-tree tent
Te arkness is loveliest were I coul sear
  You like frankincense into scent.

ere not even te stars can spy us,
  Not even te wite moths write
Wit teir little pale signs on the wall, to try us
  An set us affrigt.

Kiss but ten te ust from off my lips,
  But raw te turgi pain
From my breast to your bosom, eclipse
  My soul again.

Waste me not, I beg you, waste
  Not te inner nigt:
Taste, o taste an let me taste
  Te core of eligt.


TROT WIT THE EA

TE moon is broken in twain, an alf a moon
Before me lies on te still, pale floor of te sky;
Te oter half of the broken coin of troth
Is burie away in te ark, were the still dead lie.
Tey burie er half in the grave when they lai her
    away;
I a puse it gently in among the thick of her hair
Were it gatere towars the plait, on that very
    last ay;
An like a moon in secret it is sining tere.

My alf sines in the sky, for a general sign
Of te trot with the ea I pledged myself to keep;
Turning its broken ege to te ark, it sines indeed
Like te sign of a lover wo turns to the ark of
    sleep.
Against my eart te inviolate sleep breaks still
In arkene waves wose breaking ecoes o'er
Te wonering worl of my wakeful day, till I'm
    lost
In te mist of te places I knew so well before.


ISSOLUTE

MANY years ave I still to burn, etaine
Like a canle flame on tis boy; but I ensrine
A arkness witin me, a presence wich sleeps
    containe
In my flame of living, er soul enfole in mine.

An troug these years, while I burn on the fuel of
    life,
Wat matter te stuff I lick up in my living flame,
Seeing I keep in te fire-core, inviolate,
A nigt were she reams my reams for me, ever
    te same.


SUBMERGENCE

WEN along te pavement,
Palpitating flames of life,
People flicker roun me,
I forget my bereavement,
Te gap in te great constellation,
Te place were a star use to be.

Nay, toug the pole-star
Is blown out like a canle,
An all te eavens are wanering in disarray,
Yet wen pleias of people are
eploye around me, and I see
Te street's long outstretce Milky Way,

Wen people flicker own te pavement,
I forget my bereavement.


TE ENKINLE SPRING

TIS spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,
Wil puffing of emeral trees, and flame-filled buses,
Torn-blossom lifting in wreats of smoke between
Were te woo fumes up an the watery, flickering
    ruses.

I am amaze at tis spring, tis conflagration
Of green fires lit on te soil of te earth, this blaze
Of growing, an sparks tat puff in wil gyration,
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.

An I, wat fountain of fire am I among
Tis leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is
    tosse
About like a saow buffete in te throng
Of flames, a saow tat's gone astray, an is lost.


REPROAC

A I but known yesteray,
elen, you coul iscarge the ache
    Out of te clou;
a I known yesteray you could take
Te turgi electric ace away,
    rink it up wit your prou
Wite boy, as lovely wite lightning
Is runk from an agonise sky by te eart,
I migt ave hate you, Helen.

But since my limbs guse full of fire,
Since from out of my bloo an bone
    Poure a eavy flame
To you, eart of my atmospere, stone
Of my steel, lovely wite flint of esire,
    You ave no name.
Eart of my swaying atmospere,
Substance of my inconstant breat,
I cannot but cleave to you.

Since you ave runken up te rear
Painful electric storm, an eat
    Is wase from te blue
Of my eyes, I see you beautiful.
You are strong an passive an beautiful,
I come like wins tat uncertain over;
    But you
Are te eart I hover over.


TE ANS OF THE BETROTHE

ER tawny eyes are onyx of toughtlessness,
arene tey are like gems in ancient modesty;
Yea, an er mout's pruent and crude caress
Means even less tan er many wors to me.

Toug her kiss betrays me also this, this only
Consolation, tat in er lips her bloo at climax
    clips
Two wil, umb paws in anguis on te lonely
Fruit of my eart, ere own, rebuke, it slips.

I know from er arene lips that still her heart is
ungry for me, yet if I put my an in her breast
Se puts me away, like a saleswoman wose mart is
Enangere by te pilferer on is quest.

But er ans are still the woman, the large, strong
    ans
eavier tan mine, yet like leverets caught in
    steel
Wen I ol them; my still soul unerstands
Teir umb confession of wat her sort must feel.

For never er ans come nigh me but they lift
Like eavy birs from te morning stubble, to
    settle
Upon me like sleeping birs, like birs tat sift
Uneasily in teir sleep, isturbing my mettle.

ow caressingly se lays her han on my knee,
ow strangely se tries to isown it, as it sinks
In my fles an bone an forages into me,
ow it stirs like a subtle stoat, watever she
    tinks!

An often I see er clenc her fingers tight
An trust er fists suppresse in the folds of her
    skirt;
An sometimes, ow se grasps her arms with her
    brigt
Big ans, as if surely er arms id hurt.

An I ave seen er stan all unaware
Pressing er sprea ans over her breasts, as she
Woul crus teir mouns on her heart, to kill in
    tere
Te pain tat is her simple ache for me.

er strong ans take my part, the part of a man
To er; se crushes them into her bosom eep
Were I soul lie, an with her own strong
    span
Closes er arms, tat shoul fol me in sleep.

A, an se puts her hans upon the wall,
Presses tem tere, an kisses her bright hans,
Ten lets er black hair loose, the arkness fall
About er from er maien-foled bands.

An sits in er own ark nigt of her bitter hair
reaming--Go knows of wat, for to me se's
    te same
Betrote young lay wo loves me, and takes care
Of er womanly virtue an of my goo name.


EXCURSION

I WONER, can te nigt go by;
Can tis sot arrow of travel fly
Saft-golen wit light, sheer into the sky
    Of a awne to-morrow,
Witout ever sleep elivering us
From eac oter, or loosing the olorous
    Unfruitful sorrow!

Wat is it ten that you can see
Tat at te winow enlessly
You watc te re sparks whirl an flee
    An te nigt look through?
Your presence peering lonelily tere
Oppresses me so, I can arly bear
    To sare te train with you.

You urt my eart-beats' privacy;
I wis I coul put you away from me;
I suffocate in tis intimacy,
    For all tat I love you;
ow I ave longe for this night in the train,
Yet now every fibre of me cries in pain
    To Go to remove you.

But surely my soul's best ream is still
Tat one nigt pouring own shall swill
Us away in an utter sleep, until
    We are one, smoot-roune.
Yet closely bitten in to me
Is tis armour of stiff reluctancy
    Tat keeps me impoune.

So, ear love, wen anoter night
Pours on us, lift your fingers wite
An strip me nake, touc me ligt,
    Ligt, ligt all over.
For I ace most earnestly for your touc,
Yet I cannot move, owever muc
    I woul be your lover.

Nigt after nigt with a blemish of ay
Unblown an unblossome as witered away;
Come anoter nigt, come a new night, say
    Will you pluck me apart?
Will you open te amorous, acing bu
Of my boy, an loose te burning flood
    Tat woul leap to you from my eart?


PERFIY

OLLOW rang te house when I knocke on the oor,
An I lingere on te treshold with my hand
Upraise to knock an knock once more:
Listening for te soun of er feet across the floor,
ollow re-ecoe my heart.

Te low-ung lamps stretche own the road
Wit saows rifting underneath,
Wit a music of soft, meloious feet
Quickening my ope as I astene to meet
Te low-ung light of her eyes.

Te golen lamps own te street went out,
Te last car traile te night behin;
An I in te arkness wandered about
Wit a flutter of ope an of ark-shut doubt
In te ying lamp of my love.

Two brown ponies trotting slowly
Stoppe at a im-lit troug to drink:
Te ark van rummed down te distance slowly;
Wile te city stars so im an holy
rew nearer to searc trough the streets.

A astening car swept sameful past,
I saw er i in the shaow,
I saw er step to te curb, an fast
Run to te silent oor, were last
I a stoo wit my hand uplifted.
Se clung to te oor in her haste to enter,
Entere, an quickly cast
It sut bein her, leaving the street aghast.


A SPIRITUAL WOMAN

CLOSE your eyes, my love, let me make you blin;
       Tey ave taught you to see
Only a mean aritmetic on te face of things,
A cunning algebra in te faces of men,
       An Go like geometry
Completing is circles, an working cleverly.

I'll kiss you over te eyes till I kiss you blin;
       If I can--if any one coul.
Ten peraps in the ark you'll have got what you
         want to fin.
You've iscovere so many bits, wit your clever
         eyes,
       An I'm a kaleioscope
Tat you sake an shake, an yet it won't come to
         your min.
Now stop carping at me.--But Go, ow I ate you!
       o you fear I sall swinle you?
o you tink if you take me as I am, tat that will
         abate you
Someow?--so sa, so intrinsic, so spiritual, yet so
         cautious, you
Must ave me all in your will an your consciousness--
       I ate you.


MATING

ROUN clous roll in te arms of te wind,
Te roun eart rolls in a clasp of blue sky,
An see, were te buding hazels are thinned,
     Te wil anemones lie
In unulating sivers beneat the win.

Over te blue of te waters ply
Wite ucks, a living flotilla of clou;
An, look you, floating just tereby,
     Te blue-gleame rake stems proud
Like Abraam, wose see shoul multiply.

In te lustrous gleam of te water, there
Scramble seven toas across te silk, obscure leaves,
Seven toas tat meet in te usk to share
     Te arkness tat interweaves
Te sky an eart an water and live things everywhere.

Look now, troug the woos where the beech-green
     spurts
Like a storm of emeral snow, look, see
   A great bay stallion ances, skirts
     Te buses sumptuously,
Going outwar now in te spring to is brief eserts.

A love, wit your rich, warm face aglow,
Wat suen expectation opens you
   So wie as you watc te catkins blow
     Teir ust from te birch on the blue
Lift of te pulsing win--a, tell me you know!

A, surely! A, sure from the golen sun
A quickening, masculine gleam floats in to all
   Us creatures, people an flowers unone,
     Lying open uner is trall,
As e begets te year in us. What, then, woul you
       sun?

Wy, I soul think that from the earth there fly
Fine trills to te neighbour stars, fine yellow beams
   Trown lustily off from our full-blown, igh
     Bursting globe of reams,
To quicken te speres that are virgin still in the sky.

o you not ear eac morsel thrill
Wit joy at travelling to plant itself witin
   Te expectant one, terein to instil
     New rapture, new sape to win,
From te tick of life wake up another will?

Surely, an if tat I woul spill
Te vivi, a, the fiery surplus of life,
   From off my brimming measure, to fill
     You, an flus you rife
Wit increase, o you call it evil, an always evil?



A LOVE SONG

REJECT me not if I soul say to you
I o forget te souning of your voice,
I o forget your eyes tat searcing through
Te mists perceive our marriage, an rejoice.

Yet, wen te apple-blossom opens wie
Uner te palli moonligt's fingering,
I see your blance face at my breast, an ide
My eyes from iligent work, malingering.

A, ten, upon my beroom I o draw
Te blin to ie the garden, where the moon
Enjoys te open blossoms as tey straw
Teir beauty for is taking, boon for boon.

An I o lift my acing arms to you,
An I o lift my anguised, avid breast,
An I o weep for very pain of you,
An fling myself at te oors of sleep, for rest.

An I o toss troug the troubled night for you,
reaming your yieled mout is given to mine,
Feeling your strong breast carry me on into
Te peace were sleep is stronger even than wine.


BROTER AN SISTER

TE sorn moon trembling inistinct on her path,
Frail as a scar upon te pale blue sky,
raws towars te downward slope; some sorrow
     at
Worn er own to te quick, so she faintly fares
Along er foot-searce way without knowing why
Se creeps persistent own te sky's long stairs.

Some say tey see, tough I have never seen,
Te ea moon eaped within the new moon's arms;
For surely te fragile, fine young ting ha been
Too eavily burene to mount te heavens so.
But my eart stans still, as a new, strong read
     alarms
Me; migt a young girl be eape with such shaow
     of woe?

Since eat from te mother moon has pare us
     own to te quick,
An cast us fort like sorn, thin moons, to travel
An uncarte way among te myria thick
Strewn stars of silent people, an luminous litter
Of lives wic sorrows like mischievous ark mice
     cavel
To nougt, iminising each star's glitter,

Since eat as elivered us utterly, naked and
     wite,
Since te mont of chilhoo is over, and we stand
     alone,
Since te belove, faed moon tat set us alight
Is elivere from us and pays no eed tough we
     moan
In sorrow, since we stan in bewilerment, strange
An fearful to sally fort own te sky's long range.

We may not cry to er still to sustain us ere,
We may not ol er shaow back from the dark.
O, let us ere forget, let us take the sheer
Unknown tat lies before us, bearing te ark
Of te covenant onwars were she cannot go.
Let us rise an leave er now, se will never know.


AFTER MANY AYS

I WONER if wit you, as it is wit me,
If uner your slipping wors, tat easily flow
About you as a garment, easily,
     Your violent eart beats to an fro!

Long ave I waite, never once confesse,
Even to myself, ow bitter te separation;
Now, being come again, ow make te best
     Reparation?

If I coul cast tis cloting off from me,
If I coul lift my nake self to you,
Or if only you woul repulse me, a woun would be
     Goo; it woul let te ace come through.

But tat you ol me still so kinly cold
Aloof my flaming eart will not allow;
Yea, but I loate you tat you shoul withhol
     Your pleasure now.


BLUE

TE eart again like a ship steams out of the ark
    sea over
Te ege of te blue, an the sun stands up to see
    us glie
Slowly into anoter ay; slowly te rover
Vessel of arkness takes te rising tie.

I, on te eck, am startle by tis dawn confronting
Me wo am issue amaze from te darkness,
    strippe
An quailing ere in te sunshine, elivered from
    aunting
Te nigt unsoune whereon our days are shipped.

Feeling myself unawning, te ay's ligt playing
    upon me,
I wo am substance of saow, I all compact
Of te stuff of te night, fining myself all wrongly
Among te crows of tings in the sunshine jostle
    an racke.

I wit te night on my lips, I sigh with the silence
    of eat;
An wat o I care tough the very stones should
    cry me unreal, toug the clous
Sine in conceit of substance upon me, wo am less
    tan te rain.
o I not know te arkness witin them? What
    are tey but srous?

Te clous go own te sky with a wealthy ease
Casting a saow of scorn upon me for my sare in
    eat; but I
ol my own in te mist of them, darkling, defy
Te wole of the ay to extinguish the shaow I lift
    on te breeze.

Yea, toug the very clous have vantage over
    me,
Enjoying teir glancing fligt, though my love is
    ea,
I still am not omeless ere, I've a tent by ay
Of arkness were se sleeps on her perfect be.

An I know te ost, the minute sparkling of arkness
Wic vibrates untouche an virile through the
    graneur of nigt,
But wic, when awn crows challenge, assaulting
    te vivi motes
Of living arkness, bursts fretfully, an is brigt:

    Runs like a frette arc-lamp into ligt,
    Stirre by conflict to sining, wich else
    Were ark an wole wit the night.

    Runs to a fret of spee like a racing weel,
    Wic else were aslumber along with the whole
    Of te ark, swinging rythmic instea of a-reel.

    Is cafe to anger, bursts into rage like tuner;
    Wic else were a silent grasp that hel the
         eavens
    Arreste, beating tick wit woner.

    Leaps like a fountain of blue sparks leaping
    In a jet from out of obscurity,
    Wic erst was arkness sleeping.

    Runs into streams of brigt blue rops,
    Water an stones an stars, and myriads
    Of twin-blue eyes, an crops

    Of floury grain, an all te osts of ay,
    All lovely osts of ripples cause by fretting
    Te arkness into play.


SNAP-RAGON

SE bae me follow to er garen, where
Te mellow sunligt stoo as in a cup
Between te ol grey walls; I id not dare
To raise my face, I i not dare look up,
Lest er brigt eyes like sparrows shoul fly in
My winows of iscovery, and srill "Sin."

So wit a owncast mien an lauging voice
I followe, followe te swing of er white dress
Tat rocke in a lilt along: I watce the poise
Of er feet as tey flew for a space, then pause to
    press
Te grass eep own wit the royal burden of her:
An glaly I'd offered my breast to te tread of er.

"I like to see," se sai, an se crouched her down,
Se sunk into my sigt like a settling bir;
An er bosom couce in the confines of her gown
Like eavy birs at rest tere, softly stirre
By er measure breats: "I like to see," sai she,
"Te snap-ragon put out is tongue at me."

Se lauge, she reache her hand out to the flower,
Closing its crimson troat. My own troat in her
    power
Strangle, my eart swelle up so full
As if it woul burst its wine-skin in my troat,
Coke me in my own crimson. I watce her pull
Te gorge of te gaping flower, till the bloo id
float

      Over my eyes, an I was blin--
    er large brown an stretche over
    Te winows of my min;
    An tere in te ark I did discover
    Tings I was out to fin:
    My Grail, a brown bowl twine
    Wit swollen veins tat met in the wrist,
    Uner wose brown te amethyst
    I longe to taste. I longe to turn
    My eart's re measure in er cup,
    I longe to feel my ot bloo burn
    Wit te amethyst in her cup.

    Ten suenly se looked up,
    An I was blin in a tawny-gold day,
    Till se took er eyes away.
    So se came own from above
    An emptie my eart of love.
    So I el my eart aloft
    To te cuckoo tat hung like a ove,
    An se settle soft

  It seeme tat I an te morning world
  Were presse cup-sape to take tis reiver
  Bir wo was weary to ave furle
  er wings in us,
  As we were weary to receive er.

         Tis bir, tis rich,
         Sumptuous central grain,
         Tis mutable witc,
         Tis one refrain,
         Tis laug in the fight,
         Tis clot of nigt,
         Tis core of eligt.

  Se spoke, an I close my eyes
  To sut allucinations out.
  I ecoe wit surprise
  earing my mere lips sout
  Te answer tey i devise.

    Again I saw a brown bir over
    Over te flowers at my feet;
    I felt a brown bir over
    Over my eart, an sweet
    Its saow lay on my eart.
    I tougt I saw on the clover
    A brown bee pulling apart
    Te close fles of the clover
    An burrowing in its eart.

    Se move er han, and again
    I felt te brown bir cover
    My eart; an ten
    Te bir came own on my eart,
    As on a nest te rover
    Cuckoo comes, an soves over
    Te brim eac careful part
    Of love, takes possession, an settles er own,
    Wit er wings an her feathers to rown
    Te nest in a eat of love.

Se turne er flushe face to me for the glint
Of a moment. "See," se lauge, "if you also
Can make tem yawn." I put my an to the int
In te flower's troat, an the flower gape wide
    wit woe.
Se watce, she went of a suden intensely still,
Se watce my han, to see what I would fulfil.

I presse te wretce, throttled flower between
My fingers, till its ea lay back, its fangs
Poise at er. Like a weapon my an was white
    an keen,
An I el te choked flower-serpent in its pangs
Of morant anguis, till se cease to laugh,
Until er prie's flag, smitten, cleave down to te
    staff.

Se i her face, she murmure between her lips
Te low wor "on't." I let te flower fall,
But el my an afloat towards the slips
Of blossom se fingere, an my fingers all
Put fort to er: she i not move, nor I,
For my an like a snake watce hers, that could
    not fly.

Ten I lauge in the ark of my heart, I did exult
Like a suen cuckling of music. I bade er eyes
Meet mine, I opene er elpless eyes to consult
Teir fear, teir shame, their joy that unerlies
efeat in suc a battle. In te ark of her eyes
My eart was fierce to make er laughter rise.

Till er ark eeps sook with convulsive thrills, and
    te ark
Of er spirit wavere like water trille with light;
An my eart leape up in longing to plunge its stark
Fervour witin te pool of her twilight,
Witin er spacious soul, to grope in elight.

An I o not care, toug the large hands of revenge
Sall get my troat at last, shall get it soon,
If te joy tat they are searching to avenge
ave risen re on my nigt as a harvest moon,
Wic even eath can only put out for me;
An eat, I know, is better tan not-to-be.


A PASSING BELL

MOURNFULLY to an fro, to an fro te trees are
      waving;
   _Wat i you say, my dear?_
Te rain-bruise leaves are sudenly saken, as a
      cil
Asleep still sakes in te clutch of a sob--
   _Yes, my love, I ear._

One lonely bell, one only, te storm-tosse afternoon
      is braving,
   _Wy not let it ring?_
Te roses lean own wen they hear it, the tener,
      mil
Flowers of te bleeing-eart fall to the throb--
   _It is suc a little ting!_

A wet bir walks on te lawn, call to te boy to come
      an look,
   _Yes, it is over now._
Call to im out of te silence, call him to see
Te starling saking its hea as it walks in the
      grass--
   _A, wo knows how?_

e cannot see it, I can never sow it him, how it
      sook--
   _on't isturb im, darling._
--Its ea as it walke: I can never call im to me,
Never, e _is_ not, watever shall come to pass.
   _No, look at te wet starling._


IN TROUBLE AN SAME

    I LOOK at te swaling sunset
    An wis I coul go also
Troug the re oors beyond the black-purple bar.

    I wis tat I coul go
Troug the re oors where I could put off
    My same like soes in the porch,
    My pain like garments,
An leave my fles iscarded lying
Like luggage of some eparte traveller
    Gone one knows not were.

    Ten I woul turn roun,
An seeing my cast-off boy lying like lumber,
    I woul laug wit joy.


ELEGY

SINCE I lost you, my arling, te sky as come near,
An I am of it, te small sarp stars are quite near,
Te wite moon going among them like a white bir
    among snow-berries,
An te soun of er gently rustling in heaven like
    a bir I ear.

An I am willing to come to you now, my ear,
As a pigeon lets itself off from a cateral ome
To be lost in te aze of the sky, I woul like to
    come,
An be lost out of sigt wit you, an be gone like
    foam.

For I am tire, my ear, and if I could lift my feet,
My tenacious feet from off te ome of te earth
To fall like a breat witin the breathing win
Were you are lost, wat rest, my love, what rest!


GREY EVENING

WEN you went, ow was it you carrie with you
My missal book of fine, flamboyant ours?
My book of turrets an of re-torn bowers,
An skies of gol, and ladies in brigt tissue?

Now unerneat a blue-grey twiligt, heape
Beyon te witering snow of the shorn fiels
Stans rubble of stunte ouses; all is reaped
An garnere tat te golden daylight yields.

im lamps like yellow poppies glimmer among
Te saowy stubble of the uner-dusk,
As farter off te scythe of night is swung,
An little stars come rolling from teir usk.

An all te eart is gone into a ust
Of greyness mingle wit a fume of gol,
Covere wit age licens, pale with must,
An all te sky as withere and gone cold.

An so I sit an scan te book of grey,
Feeling te saows like a blin man reading,
All fearful lest I fin te last wors bleeding
Wit wouns of sunset an te dying day.


FIRELIGT AN NIGTFALL

TE arkness steals te forms of all the queens,
But o, te palms of his two black hans are re,
Inflame wit bining up te sheaves of dead
ours tat were once all glory an all queens.

An I remember all te sunny ours
Of queens in yacint an skies of gol,
An morning singing were te woos are scrolled
An iapered above te caunting flowers.

ere lamps are wite like snowrops in the grass;
Te town is like a curchyar, all so still
An grey now nigt is ere; nor will
Anoter torn re sunset come to pass.


TE MYSTIC BLUE

OUT of te arkness, frette sometimes in its sleeping,
Jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping
To sigt, revealing a secret, numberless secrets keeping.

Sometimes te arkness trappe witin a wheel
Runs into spee like a ream, te blue of te steel
Sowing te rocking arkness now a-reel.

An out of te invisible, streams of brigt blue rops
Rain from te sowery heavens, an bright blue
    crops
Surge from te uner-ark to teir ladder-tops.

An all te manifol blue and joyous eyes,
Te rainbow arcing over in the skies,
New sparks of woner opening in surprise.

All tese pure tings come foam an spray of the sea
Of arkness abunant, wic shaken mysteriously,
Breaks into azzle of living, as olpins tat leap
    from te sea
Of minigt sake it to fire, so the secret of eath
    we see.
