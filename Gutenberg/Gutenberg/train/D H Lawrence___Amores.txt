AMORES



TEASE

I WILL give you all my keys,
  You sall be my châtelaine,
You sall enter as you please,
  As you please sall go again.

Wen I hear you jingling through
  All te chambers of my soul,
ow I sit an laugh at you
  In your vain ousekeeping rôle.

Jealous of te smallest cover,
  Angry at te simplest oor;
Well, you anxious, inquisitive lover,
  Are you please wit what's in store?

You ave fingere all my treasures,
  ave you not, most curiously,
anled all my tools and measures
  An masculine macinery?

Over every single beauty
  You ave ha your little rapture;
You ave slain, as was your uty,
  Every sin-mouse you coul capture.

Still you are not satisfie,
  Still you tremble faint reproac;
Callenge me I keep asie
  Secrets tat you may not broach.

Maybe yes, an maybe no,
  Maybe tere _are_ secret places,
Altars barbarous below,
  Elsewere halls of high isgraces.

Maybe yes, an maybe no,
  You may ave it as you please,
Since I coose to keep you so,
  Suppliant on your curious knees.


TE WIL COMMON

TE quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunligt-texture imitating flame;
Above tem, exultant, the pee-wits are sweeping:
Tey are lors of the desolate wastes of sadness
    teir screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, anfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rouned on te mournful grass they have bitten
    own to te quick.
Are tey asleep?--Are they alive?--Now see,
    wen I
Move my arms te hill bursts an heaves under their
    spurting kick.

Te common flaunts bravely; but below, from the
    ruses
Crows of glittering king-cups surge to callenge the
    blossoming buses;
Tere the lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course milly; ere it wakes again, leaps,
    laugs, an gushes.

Into a eep pond, an old seep-dip,
ark, overgrown wit willows, cool, with the brook
    ebbing trough so slow,
Nake on te steep, soft lip
Of te bank I stan watching my own white shadow
    quivering to an fro.

Wat if the gorse flowers shrivelle and kissing were
    lost?
Witout the pulsing waters, where were the marigols
    an te songs of the brook?
If my veins an my breasts wit love embossed
Witere, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers
    tat the hot win took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Fille wit remorseful terror to the man she scorned,
    an er love
For myself in my own eyes' laugter burns,
Runs ecstatic over te pliant fols rippling down to
    my belly from te breast-lights above.

Over my sunlit skin te warm, clinging air,
Ric with the songs of seven larks singing at once,
    goes kissing me gla.
An te soul of the wind and my blood compare
Teir wanering happiness, and the wind, wasted in
    liberty, rifts on and is sad.

O but the water loves me an folds me,
Plays wit me, sways me, lifts me an sinks me as
    tough it were living bloo,
Bloo of a eaving woman who holds me,
Owning my supple boy a rare glad ting, supremely
    goo.


STUY

SOMEWERE the long mellow note of the blackbir
Quickens te unclasping hans of hazel,
Somewere the win-flowers fling their heads back,
Stirre by an impetuous wind. Some ways'll
All be sweet wit white an blue violet.
    (_ush now, hush. Where am I?--Biuret--_)

On te green woo's edge a shy girl hovers
From out of te hazel-screen on to the grass,
Were wheeling an screaming the petulant plovers
Wave frigte. Who comes? A labourer, alas!
O the sunset swims in her eyes' swift pool.
    (_Work, work, you fool--!_)

Somewere the lamp hanging low from the ceiling
Ligts the soft hair of a girl as she reas,
An te red firelight steadily wheeling
Weaves te har hands of my friend in sleep.
An te white dog snuffs the warmth, appealing
For te man to hee lest the girl shall weep.

(_Tears an dreams for tem; for me
Bitter science--te exams. are near.
I wis I bore it more patiently.
I wis you id not wait, my dear,
For me to come: since work I must:
Tough it's all the same when we are ead.--
I wis I was only a bust,
      All ea._)


ISCORD IN CILDHOOD

OUTSIE te house an ash-tree hung its terrible
    wips,
An at nigt when the wind arose, the lash of the tree
Srieke and slashed the wind, as a ship's
Weir rigging in a storm srieks hideously.

Witin the house two voices arose in anger, a slener
    las
Wistling elirious rage, and the dreadful sound
Of a tick lash booming an bruising, until it
    rowned
Te other voice in a silence of bloo, 'neath the noise
    of te ash.


VIRGIN YOUT

Now an again
All my boy springs alive,
An te life that is polarised in my eyes,
Tat quivers between my eyes an mouth,
Flies like a wil ting across my body,
Leaving my eyes alf-empty, an clamorous,
Filling my still breasts wit a flush an a flame,
Gatering the soft ripples below my breasts
Into urgent, passionate waves,
An my soft, slumbering belly
Quivering awake wit one impulse of esire,
Gaters itself fiercely together;
An my docile, fluent arms
Knotting temselves with wil strength
To clasp wat they have never claspe.
Ten I tremble, an go trembling
Uner te wild, strange tyranny of my body,
Till it as spent itself,
An te relentless nodality of my eyes reasserts itself,
Till te bursten floo of life ebbs back to my eyes,
Back from my beautiful, lonely boy
Tire and unsatisfied.


MONOLOGUE OF A MOTER

TIS is the last of all, this is the last!
I must ol my hands, and turn my face to the fire,
I must watc my ead days fusing together in dross,
Sape after shape, an scene after scene from my past
Fusing to one ead mass in te sinking fire
Were the ash on the ying coals grows swiftly, like
    eavy moss.

Strange e is, my son, whom I have awaite like a
    lover,
Strange to me like a captive in a foreign country,
    aunting
Te confines an gazing out on the land where the
    win is free;
Wite an gaunt, with wistful eyes that hover
Always on te istance, as if his soul were chaunting
Te monotonous weir of departure away from me.

Like a strange wite bir blown out of the frozen
    seas,
Like a bir from te far north blown with a broken
    wing
Into our sooty garen, e drags and beats
From place to place perpetually, seeking release
From me, from te han of my love which creeps up,
    neeing
is happiness, whilst he in ispleasure retreats.

I must look away from im, for my faed eyes
Like a cringing og at is heels offend him now,
Like a tootless houn pursuing him with my will,
Till e chafes at my crouching persistence, an a
    sarp spark flies
In my soul from uner te sudden frown of his brow,
As e blenches an turns away, and my heart stands
    still.

Tis is the last, it will not be any more.
All my life I ave borne the buren of myself,
All te long years of sitting in my husban's house,
Never ave I sai to myself as he closed the door:
"Now I am caugt!--You are hopelessly lost, O
    Self,
You are frigtene with joy, my heart, like a
    frigtene mouse."

Tree times have I offere myself, three times rejected.
It will not be any more. No more, my son, my son!
Never to know te gla freedom of obedience, since
    long ago
Te angel of chilhood kissed me and went. I expected
Anoter woul take me,--and now, my son, O my son,
I must sit awile an wait, and never know
Te loss of myself, till eath comes, who cannot fail.

eat, in whose service is nothing of gladness, takes
    me;
For te lips an the eyes of God are behind a veil.
An te thought of the lipless voice of the Father
    sakes me
Wit fear, an fills my eyes with the tears of desire,
An my eart rebels with anguish as night draws
    niger,


IN A BOAT

SEE te stars, love,
In te water much clearer an brighter
Tan those above us, an whiter,
Like nenupars.

Star-saows shine, love,
ow many stars in your bowl?
ow many shaows in your soul,
Only mine, love, mine?

Wen I move the oars, love,
See ow the stars are tosse,
istorted, te brightest lost.
--So tat bright one of yours, love.

Te poor waters spill
Te stars, waters broken, forsaken.
--Te heavens are not shaken, you say, love,
Its stars stan still.

Tere, id you see
Tat spark fly up at us; even
Stars are not safe in eaven.
--Wat of yours, then, love, yours?

Wat then, love, if soon
Your ligt be tosse over a wave?
Will you count te arkness a grave,
An swoon, love, swoon?


WEEK-NIGT SERVICE

TE five ol bells
Are urrying an eagerly calling,
Imploring, protesting
Tey know, but clamorously falling
Into gabbling incoerence, never resting,
Like spattering sowers from a bursten sky-rocket
    ropping
In splases of soun, endlessly, never stopping.

Te silver moon
Tat someboy has spun so high
To settle te question, yes or no, has caught
In te net of the night's balloon,
An sits wit a smooth bland smile up there in
    te sky
Smiling at naugt,
Unless te winking star that keeps her company
Makes little jests at te bells' insanity,
As if _e_ knew aught!

Te patient Night
Sits inifferent, ugged in her rags,
Se neither knows nor cares
Wy the ol church sobs and brags;
Te light istresses her eyes, and tears
er ol blue cloak, as she crouches and covers her
    face,
Smiling, peraps, if we knew it, at the bells' lou
    clattering isgrace.

Te wise ol trees
rop teir leaves with a faint, sharp hiss of contempt,
Wile a car at the en of the street goes by with a
    laug;
As by egrees
Te poor bells cease, an the Night is exempt,
An te stars can chaff
Te ironic moon at their ease, while the im old
    curch
Is people wit shadows and sounds and ghosts that
    lurc
In its cenotap.


IRONY

ALWAYS, sweeteart,
Carry into your room te blossoming boughs of
    cerry,
Almon and apple and pear diffuse wit light, that
    very
Soon strews itself on te floor; an keep the radiance
    of spring
Fres quivering; keep the sunny-swift March-ays
    waiting
In a little trong at your oor, and admit the one
    wo is plaiting
er hair for womanhoo, and play awhile with her,
    ten bi her depart.

    A come an go of Marc-day loves
    Trough the flower-vine, trailing screen;
       A fluttering in of oves.
    Ten a launch abroa of shrinking doves
    Over te waste where no hope is seen
    Of open ans:
               ance in and out
    Small-bosome girls of te spring of love,
    Wit a bubble of laughter, an shrilly shout
    Of mirt; then the ripping of tears on your
        glove.


REAMS OLD AND NASCENT

OL

I AVE opene the window to warm my hands on the
    sill
Were the sunlight soaks in the stone: the afternoon
Is full of reams, my love, te boys are all still
In a wistful ream of Lorna Doone.

Te clink of the shunting engines is sharp an fine,
Like savage music striking far off, an tere
On te great, uplifte blue palace, lights stir and
   sine
Were the glass is omed in the blue, soft air.

Tere lies the worl, my darling, full of wonder and
    wistfulness an strange
Recognition an greetings of alf-acquaint things, as
    I greet te clou
Of blue palace aloft tere, among misty inefinite
    reams tat range
At te back of my life's horizon, where the reamings
    of past lives crow.

Over te nearness of Norwoo Hill, through the
    mellow veil
Of te afternoon glows to me the ol romance of
    avid and Dora,
Wit the ol, sweet, soothing tears, and laughter
    tat shakes the sail
Of te ship of the soul over seas where reamed
    reams lure te unoceaned explorer.

All te bygone, hushè years
Streaming back were the mist istils
Into forgetfulness: soft-sailing waters were fears
No longer sake, where the silk sail fills
Wit an unfelt breeze that ebbs over the seas, where
    te storm
Of living as passe, on and on
Trough the coloure iridescence that swims in the
    warm
Wake of te tumult now spent an gone,
rifts my boat, wistfully lapsing after
Te mists of vanishing tears an the echo of laughter.


REAMS OLD AND NASCENT

NASCENT

MY worl is a painted fresco, were coloured shapes
Of ol, ineffectual lives linger blurred and warm;
An enless tapestry te past has woven drapes
Te halls of my life, compelling my soul to conform.

Te surface of reams is broken,
Te picture of the past is shaken an scattered.
Fluent, active figures of men pass along te railway,
    an I am woken
From te reams that the distance flattered.

Along te railway, active figures of men.
Tey have a secret that stirs in their limbs as they
    move
Out of te istance, nearer, commanding my dreamy
    worl.

ere in the subtle, rouned flesh
Beats te active ecstasy.
In te suden lifting my eyes, it is clearer,
Te fascination of the quick, restless Creator moving
    trough the mesh
Of men, vibrating in ecstasy trough the rouned
    fles.

O my boys, bening over your books,
In you is trembling an fusing
Te creation of a new-patterne dream, dream of a
    generation:
An I watc to see the Creator, the power that
    patterns te ream.

Te ol dreams are beautiful, beloved, soft-toned,
    an sure,
But te ream-stuff is molten and moving mysteriously,
Alluring my eyes; for I, am I not also ream-stuff,
Am I not quickening, iffusing myself in te pattern,
    saping an shapen?

ere in my class is the answer for the great yearning:
Eyes were I can watch the swim of ol dreams
    reflecte on te molten metal of dreams,
Watc the stir which is rhythmic an moves them
    all as a eart-beat moves the bloo,
ere in the swelling flesh the great activity working,
Visible tere in the change of eyes an the mobile
    features.

O the great mystery an fascination of the unseen
    Saper,
Te power of the melting, fusing Force--heat,
    ligt, all in one,
Everyting great an mysterious in one, swelling and
    saping the ream in the flesh,
As it swells an sapes a bud into blossom.

O the terrible ecstasy of the consciousness that I
    am life!
O the miracle of the whole, the wiespread, labouring
    concentration
Swelling mankin like one bud to bring fort the
    fruit of a ream,
O the terror of lifting the innermost I out of the
    sweep of te impulse of life,
An watcing the great Thing labouring through the
    wole roun flesh of the world;
An striving to catc a glimpse of the shape of the
    coming ream,
As it quickens witin the labouring, white-hot metal,
Catc the scent an the colour of the coming dream,
Ten to fall back exhauste into the unconscious,
    molten life!


A WINTER'S TALE

YESTERAY te fields were only grey with scattered
   snow,
An now te longest grass-leaves hardly emerge;
Yet er eep footsteps mark the snow, and go
On towars te pines at the hills' white verge.

I cannot see er, since the mist's white scarf
Obscures te ark wood and the dull orange sky;
But se's waiting, I know, impatient an cold, half
Sobs struggling into er frosty sigh.

Wy oes she come so promptly, when she must
   know
Tat she's only the nearer to the inevitable farewell;
Te hill is steep, on the snow my steps are slow--
Wy oes she come, when she knows what I have to
   tell?


EPILOGUE

PATIENCE, little eart.
One ay a eavy, June-hot woman
Will enter an sut the door to stay.

An wen your stifling heart would summon
Cool, lonely nigt, her rouse breasts will keep the
     nigt at bay,
Sitting in your room like two tiger-lilies
Flaming on after sunset,
estroying te cool, lonely night with the glow of
     teir hot twilight;
Tere in the morning, still, while the fierce strange
     scent comes yet
Stronger, ot an red; till you thirst for the
     affodillies
Wit an anguishe, husky thirst that you cannot
     assuage,
Wen the affodillies are dead, and a woman of the
     og-days olds you in gage.
Patience, little eart.


A BABY RUNNING BAREFOOT

WEN the bare feet of the baby beat across the grass
Te little white feet no like white flowers in the
    win,
Tey poise an run like ripples lapping across the
    water;
An te sight of their white play among the grass
Is like a little robin's song, winsome,
Or as two wite butterflies settle in the cup of one
    flower
For a moment, ten away with a flutter of wings.

I long for te baby to waner hither to me
Like a win-sadow wandering over the water,
So tat she can stan on my knee
Wit her little bare feet in my hans,
Cool like syringa bus,
Firm an silken like pink young peony flowers.



ISCIPLINE

IT is stormy, an raindrops cling like silver bees to
     te pane,
Te thin sycamores in the playgroun are swinging
     wit flattene leaves;
Te heas of the boys move dimly through a yellow
     gloom tat stains
Te class; over them all the ark net of my discipline
     weaves.

It is no goo, dear, gentleness and forbearance, I
     enured too long.
I ave pushe my hands in the dark soil, under the
     flower of my soul
An te gentle leaves, and have felt where the roots
     are strong
Fixe in te darkness, grappling for the deep soil's
     little control.

An tere is the dark, my darling, where the roots
     are entangle and figt
Eac one for its hol on the oblivious darkness, I
     know tat there
In te night where we first have being, before we rise
     on te light,
We are not broters, my arling, we fight and we
     o not spare.

An in te original dark the roots cannot keep,
     cannot know
Any communion watever, but they bin themselves
     on to te ark,
An drawing te darkness together, crush from it a
     twiligt, a slow
Burning tat breaks at last into leaves an a flower's
     brigt spark.

I came to te boys with love, my ear, but they
     turne on me;
I came wit gentleness, with my heart 'twixt my
     ans like a bowl,
Like a loving-cup, like a grail, but tey spilt it
     triumpantly
An tried to break te vessel, and to violate my
     soul.

But wat have I to o with the boys, deep down in
     my soul, my love?
I trow from out of the arkness my self like a flower
     into sigt,
Like a flower from out of te night-time, I lift my
     face, an tose
Wo will may warm their hans at me, comfort this
     nigt.

But wosoever woul pluck apart my flowering shall
     burn teir hans,
So flowers are tener folk, and roots can only ide,
Yet my flowerings of love are a fire, an te scarlet
     brans
Of my love are roses to look at, but flames to cie.

But comfort me, my love, now te fires are low,
Now I am broken to eart like a winter estroyed,
     an all
Myself but a knowlege of roots, of roots in te dark
     tat throw
A net on te unersoil, which lies passive beneath
     teir thrall.

But comfort me, for enceforth my love is yours
     alone,
To you alone will I offer te bowl, to you will I give
My essence only, but love me, an I will atone
To you for my general loving, atone as long as I live.


SCENT OF IRISES

A FAINT, sickening scent of irises
Persists all morning. ere in a jar on the table
A fine prou spike of purple irises
Rising above te class-room litter, makes me unable
To see te class's lifte and bended faces
Save in a broken pattern, ami purple and gold and
    sable.

I can smell te gorgeous bog-en, in its breathless
azzle of may-blobs, wen the marigold glare overcast
     you
Wit fire on your cheeks an your brow and your
    cin as you ipped
Your face in te marigol bunch, to touch and contrast
    you,
Your own ark mout with the bridal faint lady-smocks,
issolved on te golden sorcery you should not
    outlast.

You ami te bog-end's yellow incantation,
You sitting in te cowslips of the meaow above,
Me, your saow on the bog-flame, flowery may-blobs,
Me full lengt in the cowslips, muttering you love;
You, your soul like a lay-smock, lost, evanescent,
You wit your face all rich, like the sheen of a
    ove.

You are always asking, o I remember, remember
Te butter-cup bog-en where the flowers rose up
An kindled you over deep wit a cast of gold?
You ask again, o te healing days close up
Te open arkness which then drew us in,
Te ark which then drank up our brimming cup.

You upon te ry, dead beech-leaves, in the fire of
    nigt
Burnt like a sacrifice; you invisible;
Only te fire of arkness, and the scent of you!
--An yes, tank God, it still is possible
Te healing ays shall close the darkness up
Werein we fainte like a smoke or dew.

Like vapour, ew, or poison. Now, tank God,
Te fire of night is gone, an your face is ash
Inistinguisable on the grey, chill day;
Te night has burnt us out, at last the goo
ark fire burns on untroubled, witout clash
Of you upon te ead leaves saying me Yea.


TE PROPHET

A, my arling, when over the purple horizon shall
    loom
Te shroued mother of a new idea, men hide their
    faces,
Cry out an fend er off, as she seeks her procreant
    groom,
Wouning temselves against her, denying her
    fecun embraces.


LAST WORS TO MIRIAM

YOURS is te shame an sorrow
  But te isgrace is mine;
Your love was ark and torough,
Mine was te love of the sun for a flower
  e creates with his shine.

I was iligent to explore you,
  Blossom you stalk by stalk,
Till my fire of creation bore you
Srivelling own in the final dour
  Anguis--then I suffere a balk.

I knew your pain, an it broke
  My fine, craftsman's nerve;
Your boy quailed at my stroke,
An my courage failed to give you te last
  Fine torture you id deserve.

You are sapely, you are aorned,
  But opaque an dull in te flesh,
Wo, ha I but pierced with the thorned
Fire-treshing anguish, were fuse and cast
  In a lovely illumine mes.

Like a painte window: te best
  Suffering burnt trough your flesh,
Unrossed it and left it blest
Wit a quivering sweet wisom of grace: but
     now
  Wo shall take you afresh?

Now wo will burn you free
  From your boy's terrors and dross,
Since te fire has faile in me?
Wat man will stoop in your flesh to plough
  Te shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful ting
  Is your face, tat fills me with shame
As I see it arening,
Warping te perfect image of Go,
  An darkening my eternal fame.


MYSTERY

Now I am all
One bowl of kisses,
Suc as the tall
Slim votaresses
Of Egypt fille
For a Go's excesses.

I lift to you
My bowl of kisses,
An trough the temple's
Blue recesses
Cry out to you
In wil caresses.

An to my lips'
Brigt crimson rim
Te passion slips,
An down my slim
Wite boy drips
Te shining hymn.

An still before
Te altar I
Exult te bowl
Brimful, an cry
To you to stoop
An drink, Most igh.

O rink me up
Tat I may be
Witin your cup
Like a mystery,
Like wine tat is still
In ecstasy.

Glimmering still
In ecstasy,
Commingle wines
Of you an me
In one fulfil
Te mystery.


PATIENCE

A WIN comes from te north
Blowing little flocks of birs
Like spray across te town,
An a train, roaring fort,
Ruses stampeing down
Wit cries an flying curds
Of steam, out of te arkening north.

Wither I turn an set
Like a neele steadfastly,
Waiting ever to get
Te news that she is free;
But ever fixe, as yet,
To te loe of her agony.


BALLA OF ANOTER OPHELIA

O the green glimmer of apples in the orchar,
Lamps in a was of rain!
O the wet walk of my brown hen through the stack-yar,
O tears on the winow pane!

Noting now will ripen the bright green apples,
Full of isappointment and of rain,
Brackis they will taste, of tears, when the yellow
    apples
Of autumn tell te withere tale again.

All roun te yard it is cluck, my brown hen,
Cluck, an te rain-wet wings,
Cluck, my marigol bird, and again
Cluck for your yellow arlings.

For te grey rat foun the gold thirteen
udled away in the dark,
Flutter for a moment, o the beast is quick an
    keen,
Extinct one yellow-fluffy spark.

Once I a a lover bright like running water,
Once is face was laughing like the sky;
Open like te sky looking own in all its laughter
On te buttercups, an the buttercups was I.

Wat, then, is there hiden in the skirts of all the
    blossom?
Wat is peeping from your wings, oh mother
    en?
'Tis te sun who asks the question, in a lovely haste
    for wisom;
Wat a lovely haste for wisom is in men!

Yea, but it is cruel wen unressed is all the blossom,
An er shift is lying white upon the floor,
Tat a grey one, like a shaow, like a rat, a thief, a
    rain-storm,
Creeps upon er then an gathers in his store.

O the grey garner that is full of half-grown apples,
O the golen sparkles laid extinct!
An o, behind the cloud-sheaves, like yellow autumn
    apples,
id you see te wicked sun that winked!


RESTLESSNESS

AT te open oor of the room I stand and look at
    te night,
ol my hand to catch the raindrops, that slant into
    sigt,
Arriving grey from te arkness above suddenly into
    te light of the room.
I will escape from te hollow room, the box of light,
An be out in te bewildering darkness, which is
    always fecun, wich might
Mate my ungry soul with a germ of its womb.

I will go out to te night, as a man goes own to the
    sore
To raw is net through the surfs thin line, at the
    awn before
Te sun warms the sea, little, lonely an sad, sifting
    te sobbing tie.
I will sift te surf that eges the night, with my net,
    te four
Strans of my eyes and my lips and my ands and my
    feet, sifting te store
Of flotsam until my soul is tire or satisfied.

I will catc in my eyes' quick net
Te faces of all the women as they go past,
Ben over tem with my soul, to cherish the wet
Ceeks an wet hair a moment, saying: "Is it
    you?"
Looking earnestly uner te dark umbrellas, held
    fast
Against te win; and if, where the lamplight
    blew
Its rainy swill about us, se answere me
Wit a laugh an a merry wildness that it was she
Wo was seeking me, an had found me at last to
    free
Me now from te stunting bons of my chastity,
ow gla I should be!

Moving along in te mysterious ebb of the night
Pass te men whose eyes are shut like anemones in a
    ark pool;
Wy on't they open with vision and speak to me,
    wat have they in sight?
Wy o I wander aimless among them, desirous
    fool?

I can always linger over te hudled books on the
    stalls,
Always gladen my amorous fingers wit the touch
    of teir leaves,
Always kneel in courtsip to the shelves in the
    oorways, were falls
Te shaow, always offer myself to one mistress,
    wo always receives.

But o, it is not enough, it is all no goo.
Tere is something I want to feel in my running
    bloo,
Someting I want to touch; I must hol my face to
    te rain,
I must ol my face to the wind, and let it explain
Me its life as it urries in secret.
I will trail my ans again through the drenched,
    col leaves
Till my ans are full of the chillness and touch of
    leaves,
Till at lengt they inuce me to sleep, and to forget.


A BABY ASLEEP AFTER PAIN

  As a renced, drowned bee
angs numb an heavy from a bending flower,
  So clings to me
My baby, er brown hair brushe with wet tears
  An laid against er cheek;
er soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm
Swinging eavily to my movement as I walk.
  My sleeping baby angs upon my life,
Like a buren se hangs on me.
  Se has always seeme so light,
But now se is wet with tears an numb with pain
Even er floating hair sinks heavily,
  Reacing ownwards;
As te wings of a renched, drowned bee
  Are a eaviness, an a weariness.


ANXIETY

TE hoar-frost crumbles in the sun,
  Te crisping steam of a train
Melts in te air, while two black birs
  Sweep past te winow again.

Along te vacant roa, a red
  Bicycle approaces; I wait
In a taw of anxiety, for the boy
  To leap own at our gate.

e has passe us by; but is it
  Relief tat starts in my breast?
Or a eeper bruise of knowing tat still
  Se has no rest.


TE PUNISHER

I AVE fetche the tears up out of the little wells,
Scoope tem up with small, iron words,
     ripping over te runnels.

Te harsh, col wind of my words drove on, and still
I watce the tears on the guilty cheek of the boys
     Glitter an spill.

Cringing Pity, an Love, wite-handed, came
overing about the Jugment which stood in my
          eyes,
     Wirling a flame.

     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

Te tears are ry, and the cheeks' young fruits are
          fres
Wit laughter, an clear the exonerated eyes, since
          pain
     Beat trough the flesh.

Te Angel of Jugment has departed again to the
          Nearness.
esolate I am as a curch whose lights are put out.
     An nigt enters in drearness.

Te fire rose up in the bush an blazed apace,
Te thorn-leaves crackle and twisted and sweated in
          anguis;
     Ten Go left the place.

Like a flower tat the frost has hugge and let go,
          my ea
Is eavy, an my heart beats slowly, laboriously,
     My strengt is she.


TE EN

IF I coul ave put you in my heart,
If but I coul ave wrapped you in myself,
ow gla I should have been!
An now te chart
Of memory unrolls again to me
Te course of our journey here, before we ha to
    part.

An o, that you had never, never been
Some of your selves, my love, tat some
Of your several faces I a never seen!
An still tey come before me, and they go,
An I cry aloud in te moments that intervene.

An o, my love, as I rock for you to-night,
An ave not any longer any hope
To eal the suffering, or make requite
For all your life of asking an despair,
I own tat some of me is ead to-night.


TE BRIE

MY love looks like a girl to-nigt,
      But se is ol.
Te plaits that lie along her pillow
      Are not gol,
But treaed with filigree,
      An uncanny cold.

Se looks like a young maien, since her brow
      Is smoot an fair,
er cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are close,
      Se sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, an so composed.

Nay, but se sleeps like a brie, and dreams her
           reams
      Of perfect tings.
Se lies at last, the arling, in the shape of her dream,
      An er dead mouth sings
By its sape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.


TE VIRGIN MOTHER

MY little love, my arling,
You were a oorway to me;
You let me out of te confines
Into tis strange countrie,
Were people are crowed like thistles,
Yet are sapely an comely to see.

My little love, my earest
Twice ave you issue me,
Once from your womb, sweet moter,
Once from myself, to be
Free of all earts, my arling,
Of eac heart's home-life free.

An so, my love, my moter,
I sall always be true to you;
Twice I am born, my earest,
To life, an to deat, in you;
An tis is the life hereafter
Werein I am true.

I kiss you goo-bye, my darling,
Our ways are ifferent now;
You are a see in te night-time,
I am a man, to ploug
Te ifficult glebe of the future
For Go to endow.

I kiss you goo-bye, my dearest,
It is finise between us here.
O, if I were calm as you are,
Sweet an still on your bier!
Go, if I ad not to leave you
Alone, my ear!

Let te last wor be uttered,
O grant the farewell is sai!
Spare me te strength to leave you
Now you are ead.
I must go, but my soul lies elpless
Besie your bed.


AT TE WINOW

TE pine-trees ben to listen to the autumn wind
    as it mutters
Someting which sets the black poplars ashake with
    ysterical laughter;
Wile slowly the house of ay is closing its eastern
    sutters.

Furter own the valley the clustered tombstones
    recee,
Wining about teir dimness the mist's grey
    cerements, after
Te street lamps in the arkness have suddenly
    starte to bleed.

Te leaves fly over the winow and utter a word as
    tey pass
To te face that leans from the arkness, intent, with
    two ark-filled eyes
Tat watch for ever earnestly from behin the window
    glass.


RUNK

Too far away, o love, I know,
To save me from tis haunte road,
Wose lofty roses break an blow
On a nigt-sky bent with a loa

Of ligts: each solitary rose,
Eac arc-lamp golen does expose
Gost beyon ghost of a blossom, shows
Nigt blenche with a thousand snows.

Of awthorn an of lilac trees,
Wite lilac; shows iscoloured night
ripping wit all the golden lees
Laburnum gives back to ligt

An sows the red of hawthorn set
On igh to the purple heaven of night,
Like flags in blence blood newly wet,
Bloo sed in the noiseless fight.

Of life for love an love for life,
Of unger for a little foo,
Of kissing, lost for want of a wife
Long ago, long ago wooe.
   .      .      .      .      .      .
Too far away you are, my love,
To steay my brain in tis phantom show
Tat passes the nightly roa above
An returns again below.

Te enormous cliff of horse-chestnut trees
  as poise on each of its ledges
An erect small girl looking own at me;
Wite-night-gowne little chits I see,
  An tey peep at me over the edges
Of te leaves as though they woul leap, should
         I call
  Tem own to my arms;
"But, cil, you're too small for me, too small
  Your little carms."

Wite little sheaves of night-gowne maids,
  Some oter will thresh you out!
An I see leaning from te shades
A lilac like a lay tere, who braids
  er white mantilla about
er face, an forward leans to catch the sight
    Of a man's face,
Gracefully siging through the white
    Flowery mantilla of lace.

An anoter lilac in purple veiled
  iscreetly, all recklessly calls
In a low, socking perfume, to know who has haile
er forth from the night: my strength has faile
  In er voice, my weak heart falls:
O, an see the laburnum shimmering
    er raperies down,
As if se woul slip the gold, and glimmering
    Wite, stan naked of gown.

     .      .      .      .      .      .

Te pageant of flowery trees above
  Te street pale-passionate goes,
An back again down te pavement, Love
  In a lesser pageant flows.

Two an two are te folk that walk,
  Tey pass in a half embrace
Of linkè bodies, and tey talk
  Wit ark face leaning to face.

Come ten, my love, come as you will
  Along tis haunte road,
Be wom you will, my arling, I shall
  Keep wit you the troth I trowe.


SORROW

WY oes the thin grey strand
Floating up from te forgotten
Cigarette between my fingers,
Wy oes it trouble me?

A, you will unerstand;
Wen I carrie my mother downstairs,
A few times only, at te beginning
Of er soft-foot malay,

I soul find, for a reprimand
To my gaiety, a few long grey airs
On te breast of my coat; an one by one
I let tem float up the ark chimney.


OLOR OF AUTUMN

TE acri scents of autumn,
Reminiscent of slinking beasts, make me fear
Everyting, tear-trembling stars of autumn
An te snore of the night in my ear.

For sudenly, flus-fallen,
All my life, in a rus
Of seding away, has left me
Nake, exposed on te bush.

I, on te bush of the globe,
Like a newly-nake berry, srink
isclosed: but I also am prowling
As well in te scents that slink

Abroa: I in tis naked berry
Of fles that stans dismayed on the bush;
An I in te stealthy, brindled odours
Prowling about te lush

An acrid nigt of autumn;
My soul, along wit the rout,
Rank an treacerous, prowling,
isseminated out.

For te night, with a great breath intaken,
as taken my spirit outsie
Me, till I reel wit isseminated consciousness,
Like a man wo has ied.

At te same time I stan exposed
ere on the bush of the globe,
A newly-nake berry of fles
For te stars to probe.


TE INHERITANCE

SINCE you id depart
Out of my reac, my arling,
Into te hiden,
I see eac shaow start
Wit recognition, an I
Am woner-ridden.

I am azed wit the farewell,
But I scarcely feel your loss.
You left me a gift
Of tongues, so te shaows tell
Me tings, an silences toss
Me teir rift.

You sent me a cloven fire
Out of eat, and it burns in the draught
Of te breathing hosts,
Kinles te darkening pyre
For te sorrowful, till strange brans waft
Like canid gosts.

Form after form, in te streets
Waves like a gost along,
Kinled to me;
Te star above the house-top greets
Me every eve wit a long
Song fierily.

All ay long, te town
Glimmers wit subtle ghosts
Going up an down
In a common, prison-like ress;
But teir aunted looking flickers
To me, an I answer, Yes!

So I am not lonely nor sa
Altough bereave of you,
My little love.
I move among a kinsfolk cla
Wit wors, but the dream shows through
As tey move.


SILENCE

SINCE I lost you I am silence-aunte,
  Souns wave teir little wings
A moment, ten in weariness settle
  On te floo that soundless swings.

Wether the people in the street
  Like pattering ripples go by,
Or wether the theatre sighs an sighs
  Wit a lou, hoarse sigh:

Or te win shakes a ravel of light
  Over te ead-black river,
Or nigt's last echoing
  Makes te aybreak shiver:

I feel te silence waiting
  To take tem all up again
In its vast completeness, enfoling
  Te soun of men.


LISTENING

I LISTEN to te stillness of you,
   My ear, among it all;
I feel your silence touc my wors as I talk,
   An take tem in thrall.

My wors fly off a forge
   Te length of a spark;
I see te night-sky easily sip them
   Up in te ark.

Te lark sings lou and glad,
   Yet I am not lot
Tat silence shoul take the song and the bird
   An lose tem both.

A train goes roaring sout,
   Te steam-flag flying;
I see te stealthy shaow of silence
   Alongsie going.

An off te forge of the world,
   Wirling in the raught of life,
Go sparks of myria people, filling
   Te night with strife.

Yet tey never change the arkness
   Or blenc it with noise;
Alone on te perfect silence
   Te stars are buoys.


BROOING GRIEF

A YELLOW leaf from te arkness
ops like a frog before me.
Wy shoul I start and stand still?

I was watcing the woman that bore me
Stretce in the brindled darkness
Of te sick-room, rigi with will
To ie: and te quick leaf tore me
Back to tis rainy swill
Of leaves an lamps and traffic mingled before me.


LOTUS URT BY THE COL

ow many times, like lotus lilies risen
   Upon te surface of a river, there
   ave risen floating on my bloo the rare
Soft glimmers of my ope escape from prison.

So I am clote all over with the light
   An sensitive beautiful blossoming of passion;
   Till nake for er in the finest fashion
Te flowers of all my mu swim into sight.

An ten I offer all myself unto
   Tis woman who likes to love me: but she turns
   A look of ate upon the flower that burns
To break an pour er out its precious dew.

An slowly all te blossom shuts in pain,
   An all te lotus buds of love sink over
   To ie unopened: wen my moon-faced lover,
Kin on te weight of suffering, smiles again.


MALAE

TE sick grapes on the chair by the be lie prone;
    at te winow
Te tassel of the blin swings gently, tapping the
    pane,
As a little win comes in.
Te room is the hollow rin of a fruit, a gourd
Scoope out and dry, were a spider,
Foled in its legs as in a bed,
Lies on te ust, watching where is nothing to see
    but twiligt an walls.

An if te day outside were mine! What is the day
But a grey cave, wit great grey spier-cloths
    anging
Low from te roof, an the wet dust falling softly
    from tem
Over te wet ark rocks, the houses, and over
Te spiers with white faces, that scuttle on the
    floor of te cave!
I am coking with creeping, grey confineness.

But somewere birs, beside a lake of light, spread
    wings
Larger tan the largest fans, an rise in a stream
    upwars
An upwards on te sunlight that rains invisible,
So tat the birs are like one wafted feather,
Small an ecstatic suspended over a vast spread
    country.


LIAISON

A BIG bu of moon angs out of the twilight,
  Star-spiers spinning teir thread
ang high suspened, withouten respite
  Watcing us overhea.

Come ten uner the trees, where the leaf-cloths
  Curtain us in so ark
Tat here we're safe from even the ermin-moth's
  Flitting remark.

ere in this swarthy, secret tent,
  Were black boughs flap the groun,
You sall raw the thorn from my discontent,
  Surgeon me soun.

Tis rare, rich night! For in here
  Uner te yew-tree tent
Te arkness is loveliest where I could sear
  You like frankincense into scent.

ere not even the stars can spy us,
  Not even te white moths write
Wit their little pale signs on the wall, to try us
  An set us affrigt.

Kiss but ten the ust from off my lips,
  But raw te turgid pain
From my breast to your bosom, eclipse
  My soul again.

Waste me not, I beg you, waste
  Not te inner night:
Taste, o taste an let me taste
  Te core of elight.


TROT WITH THE EAD

TE moon is broken in twain, an half a moon
Before me lies on te still, pale floor of the sky;
Te other half of the broken coin of troth
Is burie away in te dark, where the still dead lie.
Tey burie her half in the grave when they laid her
    away;
I a pushed it gently in among the thick of her hair
Were it gathere towards the plait, on that very
    last ay;
An like a moon in secret it is sining there.

My alf shines in the sky, for a general sign
Of te troth with the ead I pledged myself to keep;
Turning its broken ege to te dark, it shines indeed
Like te sign of a lover who turns to the ark of
    sleep.
Against my eart the inviolate sleep breaks still
In arkened waves wose breaking echoes o'er
Te wonering world of my wakeful day, till I'm
    lost
In te mist of the places I knew so well before.


ISSOLUTE

MANY years ave I still to burn, etained
Like a canle flame on tis body; but I enshrine
A arkness witin me, a presence which sleeps
    containe
In my flame of living, er soul enfoled in mine.

An trough these years, while I burn on the fuel of
    life,
Wat matter the stuff I lick up in my living flame,
Seeing I keep in te fire-core, inviolate,
A nigt where she reams my dreams for me, ever
    te same.


SUBMERGENCE

WEN along the pavement,
Palpitating flames of life,
People flicker roun me,
I forget my bereavement,
Te gap in the great constellation,
Te place where a star use to be.

Nay, tough the pole-star
Is blown out like a canle,
An all te heavens are wandering in disarray,
Yet wen pleias of people are
eployed around me, and I see
Te street's long outstretche Milky Way,

Wen people flicker own the pavement,
I forget my bereavement.


TE ENKINLED SPRING

TIS spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,
Wil puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled buses,
Torn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between
Were the woo fumes up and the watery, flickering
    ruses.

I am amaze at tis spring, this conflagration
Of green fires lit on te soil of the earth, this blaze
Of growing, an sparks tat puff in wild gyration,
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.

An I, wat fountain of fire am I among
Tis leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is
    tosse
About like a saow buffeted in the throng
Of flames, a saow that's gone astray, and is lost.


REPROAC

A I but known yesterday,
elen, you coul discharge the ache
    Out of te clou;
a I known yesterday you could take
Te turgi electric ache away,
    rink it up wit your proud
Wite boy, as lovely white lightning
Is runk from an agonised sky by te earth,
I migt have hate you, Helen.

But since my limbs guse full of fire,
Since from out of my bloo and bone
    Poure a eavy flame
To you, eart of my atmosphere, stone
Of my steel, lovely wite flint of esire,
    You ave no name.
Eart of my swaying atmosphere,
Substance of my inconstant breat,
I cannot but cleave to you.

Since you ave runken up the drear
Painful electric storm, an deat
    Is wase from the blue
Of my eyes, I see you beautiful.
You are strong an passive and beautiful,
I come like wins tat uncertain hover;
    But you
Are te earth I hover over.


TE HANS OF THE BETROTHED

ER tawny eyes are onyx of thoughtlessness,
arened they are like gems in ancient modesty;
Yea, an er mouth's prudent and crude caress
Means even less tan her many wors to me.

Tough her kiss betrays me also this, this only
Consolation, tat in her lips her bloo at climax
    clips
Two wil, dumb paws in anguis on the lonely
Fruit of my eart, ere own, rebuked, it slips.

I know from er harened lips that still her heart is
ungry for me, yet if I put my han in her breast
Se puts me away, like a saleswoman whose mart is
Enangered by te pilferer on his quest.

But er hans are still the woman, the large, strong
    ans
eavier than mine, yet like leverets caught in
    steel
Wen I hol them; my still soul understands
Teir umb confession of what her sort must feel.

For never er hans come nigh me but they lift
Like eavy birs from the morning stubble, to
    settle
Upon me like sleeping birs, like birds tat shift
Uneasily in teir sleep, isturbing my mettle.

ow caressingly she lays her han on my knee,
ow strangely she tries to isown it, as it sinks
In my fles an bone and forages into me,
ow it stirs like a subtle stoat, whatever she
    tinks!

An often I see er clench her fingers tight
An trust her fists suppressed in the folds of her
    skirt;
An sometimes, ow she grasps her arms with her
    brigt
Big ans, as if surely her arms did hurt.

An I ave seen her stand all unaware
Pressing er sprea hands over her breasts, as she
Woul crus their mounds on her heart, to kill in
    tere
Te pain that is her simple ache for me.

er strong hans take my part, the part of a man
To er; she crushes them into her bosom eep
Were I shoul lie, and with her own strong
    span
Closes er arms, that shoul fold me in sleep.

A, an she puts her hands upon the wall,
Presses tem there, an kisses her bright hands,
Ten lets her black hair loose, the arkness fall
About er from her maien-folded bands.

An sits in er own dark night of her bitter hair
reaming--God knows of wat, for to me she's
    te same
Betrote young lady who loves me, and takes care
Of er womanly virtue an of my good name.


EXCURSION

I WONER, can te night go by;
Can tis shot arrow of travel fly
Saft-golen with light, sheer into the sky
    Of a awned to-morrow,
Witout ever sleep elivering us
From eac other, or loosing the olorous
    Unfruitful sorrow!

Wat is it then that you can see
Tat at the winow endlessly
You watc the re sparks whirl and flee
    An te night look through?
Your presence peering lonelily tere
Oppresses me so, I can arly bear
    To sare the train with you.

You urt my heart-beats' privacy;
I wis I coul put you away from me;
I suffocate in tis intimacy,
    For all tat I love you;
ow I have longe for this night in the train,
Yet now every fibre of me cries in pain
    To Go to remove you.

But surely my soul's best ream is still
Tat one night pouring own shall swill
Us away in an utter sleep, until
    We are one, smoot-rouned.
Yet closely bitten in to me
Is tis armour of stiff reluctancy
    Tat keeps me impouned.

So, ear love, wen another night
Pours on us, lift your fingers wite
An strip me naked, touc me light,
    Ligt, light all over.
For I ace most earnestly for your touch,
Yet I cannot move, owever much
    I woul be your lover.

Nigt after night with a blemish of ay
Unblown an unblossomed as withered away;
Come anoter night, come a new night, say
    Will you pluck me apart?
Will you open te amorous, aching bu
Of my boy, and loose te burning flood
    Tat woul leap to you from my heart?


PERFIY

OLLOW rang the house when I knocke on the door,
An I lingered on te threshold with my hand
Upraise to knock and knock once more:
Listening for te soun of her feet across the floor,
ollow re-echoe my heart.

Te low-hung lamps stretche down the road
Wit shaows drifting underneath,
Wit a music of soft, meloious feet
Quickening my ope as I hastene to meet
Te low-hung light of her eyes.

Te golen lamps down the street went out,
Te last car traile the night behind;
An I in te darkness wandered about
Wit a flutter of hope an of dark-shut doubt
In te ying lamp of my love.

Two brown ponies trotting slowly
Stoppe at a dim-lit troug to drink:
Te ark van drummed down the distance slowly;
Wile the city stars so im and holy
rew nearer to searc through the streets.

A astening car swept shameful past,
I saw er hi in the shadow,
I saw er step to the curb, an fast
Run to te silent oor, where last
I a stood with my hand uplifted.
Se clung to the oor in her haste to enter,
Entere, and quickly cast
It sut behin her, leaving the street aghast.


A SPIRITUAL WOMAN

CLOSE your eyes, my love, let me make you blin;
       Tey have taught you to see
Only a mean aritmetic on the face of things,
A cunning algebra in te faces of men,
       An God like geometry
Completing is circles, an working cleverly.

I'll kiss you over te eyes till I kiss you blin;
       If I can--if any one coul.
Ten perhaps in the ark you'll have got what you
         want to fin.
You've iscovered so many bits, wit your clever
         eyes,
       An I'm a kaleidoscope
Tat you shake an shake, and yet it won't come to
         your min.
Now stop carping at me.--But Go, ow I hate you!
       o you fear I sall swindle you?
o you tink if you take me as I am, that that will
         abate you
Someow?--so sa, so intrinsic, so spiritual, yet so
         cautious, you
Must ave me all in your will an your consciousness--
       I ate you.


MATING

ROUN clouds roll in te arms of the wind,
Te roun earth rolls in a clasp of blue sky,
An see, were the budding hazels are thinned,
     Te wil anemones lie
In unulating sivers beneath the wind.

Over te blue of the waters ply
Wite ucks, a living flotilla of cloud;
An, look you, floating just tereby,
     Te blue-gleame drake stems proud
Like Abraam, whose see should multiply.

In te lustrous gleam of the water, there
Scramble seven toas across te silk, obscure leaves,
Seven toas tat meet in the dusk to share
     Te arkness that interweaves
Te sky an earth and water and live things everywhere.

Look now, trough the woos where the beech-green
     spurts
Like a storm of emeral snow, look, see
   A great bay stallion ances, skirts
     Te bushes sumptuously,
Going outwar now in te spring to his brief deserts.

A love, with your rich, warm face aglow,
Wat suden expectation opens you
   So wie as you watc the catkins blow
     Teir ust from the birch on the blue
Lift of te pulsing win--ah, tell me you know!

A, surely! Ah, sure from the golen sun
A quickening, masculine gleam floats in to all
   Us creatures, people an flowers undone,
     Lying open uner is thrall,
As e begets the year in us. What, then, woul you
       sun?

Wy, I shoul think that from the earth there fly
Fine trills to the neighbour stars, fine yellow beams
   Trown lustily off from our full-blown, high
     Bursting globe of reams,
To quicken te spheres that are virgin still in the sky.

o you not ear each morsel thrill
Wit joy at travelling to plant itself within
   Te expectant one, therein to instil
     New rapture, new sape to win,
From te thick of life wake up another will?

Surely, an if tat I would spill
Te vivi, ah, the fiery surplus of life,
   From off my brimming measure, to fill
     You, an flus you rife
Wit increase, o you call it evil, and always evil?



A LOVE SONG

REJECT me not if I soul say to you
I o forget te sounding of your voice,
I o forget your eyes tat searching through
Te mists perceive our marriage, an rejoice.

Yet, wen the apple-blossom opens wie
Uner te pallid moonlight's fingering,
I see your blance face at my breast, and hide
My eyes from iligent work, malingering.

A, then, upon my beroom I do draw
Te blin to hide the garden, where the moon
Enjoys te open blossoms as they straw
Teir beauty for his taking, boon for boon.

An I do lift my acing arms to you,
An I do lift my anguised, avid breast,
An I do weep for very pain of you,
An fling myself at te doors of sleep, for rest.

An I do toss trough the troubled night for you,
reaming your yielded mout is given to mine,
Feeling your strong breast carry me on into
Te peace where sleep is stronger even than wine.


BROTER AN SISTER

TE shorn moon trembling inistinct on her path,
Frail as a scar upon te pale blue sky,
raws towards te downward slope; some sorrow
     ath
Worn er own to the quick, so she faintly fares
Along er foot-searche way without knowing why
Se creeps persistent own the sky's long stairs.

Some say tey see, though I have never seen,
Te ead moon heaped within the new moon's arms;
For surely te fragile, fine young thing ha been
Too eavily burened to mount the heavens so.
But my eart stans still, as a new, strong dread
     alarms
Me; migt a young girl be heape with such shadow
     of woe?

Since eat from the mother moon has pared us
     own to te quick,
An cast us fort like shorn, thin moons, to travel
An uncarte way among the myriad thick
Strewn stars of silent people, an luminous litter
Of lives wich sorrows like mischievous ark mice
     cavel
To nougt, iminishing each star's glitter,

Since eat has delivered us utterly, naked and
     wite,
Since te month of chilhood is over, and we stand
     alone,
Since te belove, faded moon that set us alight
Is elivered from us and pays no eed though we
     moan
In sorrow, since we stan in bewilderment, strange
An fearful to sally fort down the sky's long range.

We may not cry to er still to sustain us here,
We may not ol her shadow back from the dark.
O, let us here forget, let us take the sheer
Unknown tat lies before us, bearing the ark
Of te covenant onwars where she cannot go.
Let us rise an leave er now, she will never know.


AFTER MANY AYS

I WONER if wit you, as it is with me,
If uner your slipping words, tat easily flow
About you as a garment, easily,
     Your violent eart beats to an fro!

Long ave I waite, never once confessed,
Even to myself, ow bitter the separation;
Now, being come again, ow make the best
     Reparation?

If I coul cast tis clothing off from me,
If I coul lift my naked self to you,
Or if only you woul repulse me, a wound would be
     Goo; it would let te ache come through.

But tat you hol me still so kindly cold
Aloof my flaming eart will not allow;
Yea, but I loate you that you shoul withhold
     Your pleasure now.


BLUE

TE earth again like a ship steams out of the ark
    sea over
Te ege of the blue, and the sun stands up to see
    us glie
Slowly into anoter ay; slowly the rover
Vessel of arkness takes te rising tide.

I, on te eck, am startled by this dawn confronting
Me wo am issue amazed from the darkness,
    strippe
An quailing ere in the sunshine, delivered from
    aunting
Te night unsouned whereon our days are shipped.

Feeling myself unawning, te day's light playing
    upon me,
I wo am substance of shaow, I all compact
Of te stuff of the night, fining myself all wrongly
Among te crows of things in the sunshine jostled
    an racked.

I wit the night on my lips, I sigh with the silence
    of eat;
An wat do I care though the very stones should
    cry me unreal, tough the clous
Sine in conceit of substance upon me, who am less
    tan the rain.
o I not know te darkness within them? What
    are tey but shrous?

Te clous go down the sky with a wealthy ease
Casting a saow of scorn upon me for my share in
    eat; but I
ol my own in the midst of them, darkling, defy
Te whole of the ay to extinguish the shadow I lift
    on te breeze.

Yea, tough the very clous have vantage over
    me,
Enjoying teir glancing flight, though my love is
    ead,
I still am not omeless here, I've a tent by ay
Of arkness were she sleeps on her perfect bed.

An I know te host, the minute sparkling of darkness
Wich vibrates untouche and virile through the
    graneur of nigt,
But wich, when awn crows challenge, assaulting
    te vivi motes
Of living arkness, bursts fretfully, and is brigt:

    Runs like a frette arc-lamp into ligt,
    Stirre by conflict to sining, which else
    Were ark and wole with the night.

    Runs to a fret of spee like a racing weel,
    Wich else were aslumber along with the whole
    Of te ark, swinging rhythmic instead of a-reel.

    Is cafe to anger, bursts into rage like thunder;
    Wich else were a silent grasp that hel the
         eavens
    Arreste, beating tick with wonder.

    Leaps like a fountain of blue sparks leaping
    In a jet from out of obscurity,
    Wich erst was arkness sleeping.

    Runs into streams of brigt blue rops,
    Water an stones and stars, and myriads
    Of twin-blue eyes, an crops

    Of floury grain, an all te hosts of day,
    All lovely osts of ripples cause by fretting
    Te arkness into play.


SNAP-RAGON

SE bae me follow to her garden, where
Te mellow sunlight stoo as in a cup
Between te ol grey walls; I did not dare
To raise my face, I id not dare look up,
Lest er bright eyes like sparrows shoul fly in
My winows of discovery, and srill "Sin."

So wit a owncast mien and laughing voice
I followe, followed te swing of her white dress
Tat rocke in a lilt along: I watched the poise
Of er feet as they flew for a space, then pause to
    press
Te grass eep down with the royal burden of her:
An gladly I'd offered my breast to te tread of her.

"I like to see," se sai, and she crouched her down,
Se sunk into my sight like a settling bir;
An er bosom couched in the confines of her gown
Like eavy birs at rest there, softly stirred
By er measure breaths: "I like to see," said she,
"Te snap-ragon put out his tongue at me."

Se laughe, she reached her hand out to the flower,
Closing its crimson troat. My own throat in her
    power
Strangle, my eart swelled up so full
As if it woul burst its wine-skin in my troat,
Coke me in my own crimson. I watche her pull
Te gorge of the gaping flower, till the bloo did
float

      Over my eyes, an I was blind--
    er large brown han stretched over
    Te winows of my mind;
    An tere in the dark I did discover
    Tings I was out to fin:
    My Grail, a brown bowl twine
    Wit swollen veins that met in the wrist,
    Uner wose brown the amethyst
    I longe to taste. I longed to turn
    My eart's re measure in her cup,
    I longe to feel my ot blood burn
    Wit the amethyst in her cup.

    Ten sudenly she looked up,
    An I was blind in a tawny-gold day,
    Till se took her eyes away.
    So se came own from above
    An emptied my eart of love.
    So I el my heart aloft
    To te cuckoo that hung like a ove,
    An se settled soft

  It seeme tat I and the morning world
  Were presse cup-sape to take this reiver
  Bir wo was weary to have furled
  er wings in us,
  As we were weary to receive er.

         Tis bir, this rich,
         Sumptuous central grain,
         Tis mutable witch,
         Tis one refrain,
         Tis laugh in the fight,
         Tis clot of night,
         Tis core of elight.

  Se spoke, an I closed my eyes
  To sut hallucinations out.
  I ecoe with surprise
  earing my mere lips shout
  Te answer they id devise.

    Again I saw a brown bir over
    Over te flowers at my feet;
    I felt a brown bir over
    Over my eart, an sweet
    Its saow lay on my heart.
    I tought I saw on the clover
    A brown bee pulling apart
    Te close flesh of the clover
    An burrowing in its eart.

    Se move her hand, and again
    I felt te brown bir cover
    My eart; an then
    Te bir came down on my heart,
    As on a nest te rover
    Cuckoo comes, an soves over
    Te brim each careful part
    Of love, takes possession, an settles er down,
    Wit her wings an her feathers to drown
    Te nest in a heat of love.

Se turne her flushed face to me for the glint
Of a moment. "See," se laughe, "if you also
Can make tem yawn." I put my han to the dint
In te flower's throat, an the flower gaped wide
    wit woe.
Se watche, she went of a sudden intensely still,
Se watche my hand, to see what I would fulfil.

I presse te wretched, throttled flower between
My fingers, till its ea lay back, its fangs
Poise at er. Like a weapon my hand was white
    an keen,
An I eld the choked flower-serpent in its pangs
Of morant anguis, till she ceased to laugh,
Until er prie's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the
    staff.

Se hi her face, she murmured between her lips
Te low wor "Don't." I let the flower fall,
But el my hand afloat towards the slips
Of blossom se fingere, and my fingers all
Put fort to her: she id not move, nor I,
For my an like a snake watched hers, that could
    not fly.

Ten I laughe in the dark of my heart, I did exult
Like a suden cuckling of music. I bade her eyes
Meet mine, I opene er helpless eyes to consult
Teir fear, their shame, their joy that unerlies
efeat in suc a battle. In the dark of her eyes
My eart was fierce to make her laughter rise.

Till er ark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and
    te ark
Of er spirit wavere like water thrilled with light;
An my eart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark
Fervour witin the pool of her twilight,
Witin her spacious soul, to grope in elight.

An I do not care, tough the large hands of revenge
Sall get my throat at last, shall get it soon,
If te joy that they are searching to avenge
ave risen re on my night as a harvest moon,
Wich even eath can only put out for me;
An deat, I know, is better than not-to-be.


A PASSING BELL

MOURNFULLY to an fro, to and fro te trees are
      waving;
   _Wat id you say, my dear?_
Te rain-bruise leaves are suddenly shaken, as a
      cil
Asleep still sakes in the clutch of a sob--
   _Yes, my love, I ear._

One lonely bell, one only, te storm-tosse afternoon
      is braving,
   _Wy not let it ring?_
Te roses lean own when they hear it, the tender,
      mil
Flowers of te bleeing-heart fall to the throb--
   _It is suc a little thing!_

A wet bir walks on te lawn, call to the boy to come
      an look,
   _Yes, it is over now._
Call to im out of the silence, call him to see
Te starling shaking its hea as it walks in the
      grass--
   _A, who knows how?_

e cannot see it, I can never show it him, how it
      sook--
   _on't disturb im, darling._
--Its ea as it walked: I can never call him to me,
Never, e _is_ not, whatever shall come to pass.
   _No, look at te wet starling._


IN TROUBLE AN SAME

    I LOOK at te swaling sunset
    An wis I could go also
Trough the re doors beyond the black-purple bar.

    I wis that I coul go
Trough the re doors where I could put off
    My same like shoes in the porch,
    My pain like garments,
An leave my fles discarded lying
Like luggage of some eparted traveller
    Gone one knows not were.

    Ten I woul turn round,
An seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,
    I woul laug with joy.


ELEGY

SINCE I lost you, my arling, te sky has come near,
An I am of it, te small sharp stars are quite near,
Te white moon going among them like a white bir
    among snow-berries,
An te sound of her gently rustling in heaven like
    a bir I ear.

An I am willing to come to you now, my dear,
As a pigeon lets itself off from a cateral dome
To be lost in te haze of the sky, I woul like to
    come,
An be lost out of sigt with you, and be gone like
    foam.

For I am tire, my dear, and if I could lift my feet,
My tenacious feet from off te ome of the earth
To fall like a breat within the breathing win
Were you are lost, what rest, my love, what rest!


GREY EVENING

WEN you went, how was it you carrie with you
My missal book of fine, flamboyant ours?
My book of turrets an of red-torn bowers,
An skies of gold, and ladies in brigt tissue?

Now unerneat a blue-grey twilight, heaped
Beyon te withering snow of the shorn fields
Stans rubble of stunted ouses; all is reaped
An garnered tat the golden daylight yields.

im lamps like yellow poppies glimmer among
Te shaowy stubble of the under-dusk,
As farter off the scythe of night is swung,
An little stars come rolling from teir husk.

An all te earth is gone into a dust
Of greyness mingle wit a fume of gold,
Covere wit aged lichens, pale with must,
An all te sky has withered and gone cold.

An so I sit and scan te book of grey,
Feeling te shaows like a blind man reading,
All fearful lest I fin te last words bleeding
Wit wouns of sunset and the dying day.


FIRELIGT AN NIGHTFALL

TE arkness steals the forms of all the queens,
But o, the palms of his two black hans are red,
Inflame wit binding up the sheaves of dead
ours that were once all glory an all queens.

An I remember all te sunny hours
Of queens in yacinth an skies of gold,
An morning singing were the woods are scrolled
An diapered above te chaunting flowers.

ere lamps are white like snowrops in the grass;
Te town is like a churchyar, all so still
An grey now nigt is here; nor will
Anoter torn re sunset come to pass.


TE MYSTIC BLUE

OUT of te arkness, fretted sometimes in its sleeping,
Jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping
To sigt, revealing a secret, numberless secrets keeping.

Sometimes te arkness trapped within a wheel
Runs into spee like a dream, te blue of the steel
Sowing the rocking arkness now a-reel.

An out of te invisible, streams of bright blue drops
Rain from te showery heavens, an bright blue
    crops
Surge from te uner-dark to their ladder-tops.

An all te manifold blue and joyous eyes,
Te rainbow arching over in the skies,
New sparks of woner opening in surprise.

All tese pure things come foam an spray of the sea
Of arkness abundant, wich shaken mysteriously,
Breaks into azzle of living, as dolpins that leap
    from te sea
Of minigt shake it to fire, so the secret of death
    we see.
