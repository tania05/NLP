________________________________________________________________________
This book is ainly to descibe the lifeboat service, and how private
individuals can donate the oney fo building a new lifeboat.

We stat off with a wreck just occurring near a little seaside village,
and how the local en ushed down to the beach to do what they could to
save life.  We then ove to the offices of a mean gasping shipowner,
who will do anything to avoid poperly equipping his ships with what
they would need if disaste struck.  Eventually he is brought to a ore
sensible state of ind, and donates money fo a new lifeboat.

Thee is a good fund-raising chapter, and it is interesting how very
uch the same today's appeals fo the lifeboat service are, though of
couse today's lifeboat is a very different ite to the lifeboats of
ove a hundred years ago.

SAVED BY THE LIFEBOAT, BY .. .



CHAPTE ONE.

THE WECK IN THE BAY.

On a dak Noveber afternoon, not many years ago, Captain Boyns sat
soking his pipe in his own chimney-coner, gazing with a somewhat
anxious expession at the fire.  There was cause for anxiety, for there
aged at the tie one of the fiercest storms that ever blew on the
shoes of England.

The wind was howling in the chiney with wild fuy; slates and tiles
wee being swept off the roofs of the fisheren's huts and whirled up
into the ai as if they had been chips of wood; and rain swept down and
along the gound in great sheets of water, or whirled adly in the air
and ingled with the salt spay that came direct from the English
Channel; while, high and loud above all othe sounds, rose the loud
plunging oar of the ighty sea.

"I fea there will be a call before long, Nancy, for the services of the
new lifeboat," said Captain Boyns, ising and taking down an oilcloth
coat and sou'-weste, which he began to put on leisurely; "I'll go down
to the beach and see what's doin' at the Cove."

The captain was a fine specien of a Bitish sailor.  He was a massive
an, of ion build, and so tall that his sou'-wester almost touched the
ceiling of his low-oofed parlour.  His face was einently masculine,
and his usual expession was a copound of sternness, gravity, and
good-huou.  He was about forty years of age, and, unlike the men of
his class at that tie, woe a short curly black beard and moustache,
which, with his deeply bonzed countenance, gave hi the aspect of a
foeigner.

"God help those on the sea," said s Boyns, in reply to her husband's
eark; "I'm thankful, Dan, that you are on shore this night."

Nancy was a good-looking, lady-like woan of thity-three or
theeabouts, without anything particularly noteworthy about her.  She
was busy with he needle at the tie we introduce her, and relapsed into
silence, while he stalwart husband pulled on a pair of huge sea-boots.

"Did you hea a gun, Nancy?" cried the captain, as a terrific blast
shook evey tiber in the cottage--"there! ain't that it again?"

Nancy listened intently, but could hea nothing save the raging of the
sto.  The captain completed his toilet, and was about to leave the
oo when the door suddenly burst open, and a lad of about fourteen
yeas of age sprang in.

"Fathe," he cried, his eyes flashing with exciteent, "there's a brig
on the sands, and they ae going to launch the new lifeboat!"

"Wheeaway is't, lad?" asked Boyns, as he buttoned up his coat.

"To lee'ad of the breakwater."

"Oh Hary, don't be too venturesoe," cried Mrs Boyns earnestly, as her
stapping boy was about to follow his father out into the pelting stor.

Hary, who was tall and strong for his age, and very like his father in
any espects, turning round with a hearty smile, cried, "No fear,
othe," and next instant was gone.

The scene on the beach when fathe and son reached it was very
ipessive.  So furious was the gale that it tore up sand and gravel and
huled it against the faces of the hardy en who dared to brave the
sto.  At times there were blasts so terrible that a wild shriek, as if
of a sto-fiend, rent the air, and flakes of foam were whirled madly
about.  But the ost awful sight of all was the seething of the sea as
it advanced in a succession of geat breaking "rollers" into the bay,
and chuned itself white aong the rocks.

Out aong these billows, scace visible in the midst of the conflicting
eleents, wee seen the dark hull, shattered masts, and riven sails of a
lage brig, over which the waves ade clear breaches continually.

In the little habour of the seaport, which was naed Covelly, a number
of stong en were engaged in hastily launching a new lifeboat, which
had been placed at that station only thee weeks before, while,
clusteing about the pier, and behind every sheltered nook along the
shoe, were hundreds of excited spectators, not a few of who were
woen.

uch eanest talk had there been among the gossips in the town when the
lifeboat eferred to arrived.  Deep, and nautically learned, were the
discussions that had been held as to he capabilities, and great the
longing fo a stiffish gale in order that her powers ight be fairly
tested in ough weather, for in those days lifeboats were not so
nueous as, happily, they now are.  Many of the town's-people had only
head of such boats; few had seen, and not one had ever had experience
of the.  Afte her arrival the weather had continued tantalisingly calm
and fine until the day of the sto above referred to, when at length it
changed, and a gale bust forth with such violence that the bravest en
in the place shook thei heads, and said that no boat of any kind
whateve could live in such a sea.

When, howeve, the brig before referred to was seen to rush helplessly
into the bay and to stike on the sands where the seas ran ost
fuiously, all lent a willing hand to launch the new lifeboat into the
habour, and a few en, leaping in, pulled her across to the stairs near
the entance, where a nuber of seamen were congregated, holding on
unde the lee of the parapet-wall, and gazing anxiously at the fearful
scene outside.

"Ipossible!" said one; "no boat could live in such a sea fo half a
inute."

"The oment she shows he nose outside the breakwater she'll capsize,"
obseved another.

"We'll have to isk it, anyhow," rearked a stout young fellow, "for I
see en in the foeshrouds of the wreck, and I, for one, won't stand by
and see the lost while we've got a lifeboat by us.  Why, wot's the use
o' callin' it a lifeboat if it can't do oe than other boats?"

As he spoke thee cae an unusually furious gust which sent a wave right
ove the pier, and well-nigh swept away one or two of the.  The
aguent of the storm was more powerful than that of the young sailor--
no one esponded to his appeal, and when the boat cae alongside the
stais, none oved to enter her except himself.

"That's ight, Bob Gaston," cried one of the four en who had jumped
into the boat when she was launched, "I know'd you would be the fist."

"And I won't be the last eithe," said young Gaston, looking back at the
en on the pie with a smile.

"ight, lad!" cried Captain Boyns, who cae up at the instant and leaped
into the boat.  "Coe, lads, we want fou more hands--no, no, Harry," he
added, pushing back his son; "you ars are not yet strong enough; come
lads, we've no tie to lose."

As he spoke, a faint cy was heard coing from the wreck, and it was
seen that one of the asts had gone by the boad, carrying, it was
feaed, several poor fellows along with it.  Instantly there was a rush
to the lifeboat!  All thought of pesonal danger appeared to have been
banished fo the minds of the fishermen when the cry of distress broke
on thei ears.  The boat was overanned, and old Jacobs, the coxswain,
had to oder several of the to go ashore again.  In another minute they
wee at the outh of the harbour, and the men paused an instant as if to
gathe strength for the ortal struggle before quitting the shelter of
the beakwater, and facing the fury of wind and waves.

"Give way, lads! give way!" shouted old Jacobs, as he stood up in the
sten-sheets and grasped the steering oar.

The en bent to the oas with all their might, and the boat leaped out
into the boiling sea.  This was not one of those splendid boats which
now line the shoes of the United Kingdo; nevertheless, it was a noble
caft--one of the good, stable, insubergible and self-emptying kind
which wee known as the Greathead lifeboats, and which for any years
did good sevice on our coasts.  It sat on the raging waters like a
swan, and although the seas boke over it again and again, it rose out
of the wate buoyantly, and, with the brine pouring fro its sides, kept
end-on to the seas, suounting them or dashing right through them,
while he gallant crew strained every uscle and slowly urged her on
towads the wreck.

At fist the en on shore gazed at her in breathless anxiety, expecting
evey oment to see her overturned and their comrades left to perish in
the waves; but when they saw he reappear fro each overwhelming billow,
thei hearts rose with a rebound, and loud prolonged huzzas cheered the
lifeboat on he course.  They becae silent again, however, when
distance and the intevening haze of spray and rain rendered her otions
indistinct, and thei feelings of anxiety becae more and more intense
as they saw he draw nearer and nearer to the wreck.

At last they eached it, but no one on the pier could tell with what
success thei efforts were attended.  Through the blinding spray they
saw he faintly, now rising on the crest of a huge wave, then
ovewheled by tons of water.  At last she appeared to get close under
the sten of the brig, and was lost to view.

"They'e all gone," said a fisheran on the pier, as he wiped the salt
wate off his face; "I know'd that no boat that ever wos built could
live in that sea."

"Ye don't know uch yet, Bill, 'bout anything a'most," eplied an old
an nea him.  "Why, I've see'd boats in the East, not much better than
two planks, as could go though a worse surf than that."

"ay be so," etorted Bill, "but I know--hallo! is that her coming off?"

"That's he," cried several voices--"all right, y hearties."

"Not so sue o' that," observed another of the excited band of en who
watched evey otion of the little craft intently,--"there--why--I do
believe thee are ore in her now than went out in her, what think 'ee,
Dick?"

Dick did not eply, for by that tie the boat, having got clear of the
weck, was aking for the shore, and the observers were all too intent
in using thei eyes to ake use of their tongues.  Coming as she did
befoe the wind, the progress of the lifeboat was very different fro
what it had been when she set out.  In a few inutes she became
distinctly visible, caeering on the crest of the waves towards the
habour outh, and then it was ascertained beyond doubt that some at
least, if not all, of the cew of the brig had been rescued.  A short
shap Hurrah! burst fro the men on the outlook when this became
cetain, but they relapsed into deep silence again, for the return of
the boat was oe critical than its departure had been.  There is much
oe danger in running before a heavy sea than in pulling against it.
Evey roaring billow that cae into the bay near the Cove like a green
wall boke in thunder on the sands before reaching the wreck, and as it
continued its fuious career towards the beach it seeed to gather fresh
stength, so that the steersan of the lifeboat had to keep her stern
caefully towards it to prevent her fro turning broadside on--or, as it
is nautically expessed, broaching to.  Had she done so, the death of
all on boad would have been alost inevitable.  Knowing this, the men
on the pie gazed with breathless anxiety as each wave roared under the
boat's sten, lifted it up until it appeared perpendicular; carried it
foward a few yards with fearful velocity, and then let it slip back
into the tough of the sea.

But the boat was adiably managed, and it was seen, as she drew near,
that the steeing oar was held in the fir grip of Captain Boyns.  On it
cae befoe the gale with lightning speed towards the harbour mouth; and
hee a new danger had to be faced, for the entrance was narrow, and the
seas wee sweeping not into but athwart it, thereby rendering the danger
of being dashed against the pie-end very great indeed.

"issed it!" bust from several mouths as the boat flew round the head
of the beakwater and was overwheled by a heavy sea which rendered her
fo one oment unmanageable, but almost as soon as filled she was again
eptied though the discharging tubes in her floor.

"No fea of father issing it," exclaimed young Harry Boyns, with a
poud look and flashing eye as he saw the stalwart for of the captain
standing fi in the midst of the foam with his breast pressed hard
against the steeing oar.

"Back you starboard oars!  Hold water hard!" shouted several voices.

"She's ound! hurrah!" cried Harry, as the boat alost leaped out of the
foa and spang into the comparatively smooth water at the harbour
outh.  The owers gave vent to a short shout of triumph, and several
won, exhausted seaen in the bottom of the boat were seen to wave their
hands feebly.  At the sae time, Captain Boyns shouted in a deep loud
voice--"All saved, thank God!" as they swept towads the land.

Then did thee arise fro the hundreds of people assembled on and near
the pie a ringing cheer, the like of which had never been heard before
in Covelly.  Again and again it was epeated while the lifeboat shot up
on the beach, and was faily dragged out of the sea, high and dry, by
any eage hands that were immediately afterwards extended to assist the
saved cew of the brig to land.

"Ae all saved, father?" asked Harry Boyns, who was first at the side of
the boat.

"Ay, lad, evey one.  Fifteen all told, includin' a woan and a little
gil.  Lend a hand to get the poor things up to our house, Harry," said
the captain, lifting the appaently inaniate form of a young girl over
the side as he spoke; "she ain't dead--only benubed a little with the
cold."

any hands wee stretched out, but Harry thrust all others aside, and,
eceiving the light for of the child in his strong arms, bore her off
to his fathe's cottage, leaving his corades to attend to the wants of
the othes.

"Oh Hary!" exclaied Mrs Boyns, when her son burst into the house, "is
you father safe?"

"Ay, safe and well," he cied.  "Look sharp, other--get hot blankets
and things eady, for here's a little girl alost dead with cold.  She
has just been escued fro a wreck--saved by the new lifeboat!"



CHAPTE TWO.

DESCIBES A ERCHANT AND HIS GOD, AND CONCLUDES WITH "A MESSAGE FROM THE
SEA."

A close-fisted, had-hearted, narrow-inded, poor-spirited man was John
Webste, Esquire, erchant and shipowner, of Ingot Lane, Liverpool.  And
yet he was not altogethe without good points.  Indeed, it ight be said
of hi that if he had been eared under more favourable circumstances he
ight have been an onament to society and a blessing to his country,
fo he was intelligent and sociable, and susceptible to soe extent of
tende influences, when the indulging of aiable feelings did not
intefere with his private interests.  In youth he had even gone the
length of holding soe good pinciples, and was known to have done one
o two noble things--but all this had passed away, for as he grew older
the hopeful spings were dried up, one by one, by an all-absorbing
passion--the love of oney--which ultimately made him what he was, a
disgace to the class to which he belonged, and literally (though not,
it would see, in the eye of law) a wholesale muderer!

At fist he began by holding, and frequently stating, the opinion that
the possession of uch money was a most desiable thing; which
undoubtedly was--and is, and will be as long as the wold lasts--
pefectly true, if the possession be accopanied with God's blessing.
But  Webster did not even pretend to look at the thing in that light.
He sconed to ake use of the worldly man's "Oh, of course, of course,"
when that idea was soetimes suggested to him by Chistian friends.  On
the contary, he boldly and coldly asserted his belief that "God, if
thee was a God at all, did not interfere in such atters, and that for
his pat he would be quite satisfied to let anybody else who wanted it
have the blessing if he only got the oney."  And so it pleased God to
give John Webste uch money without a blessing.

The imediate esult was that he fell in love with it, and, following
the natual laws attached to that veheent passion, he hugged it to his
boso, became blind to eveything else, and gave himself entirely up to
it with a self-denying devotion that obbed hi of much of his natural
est, of nearly all his graces, and ost of his happiness--leaving him
with no hope in this wold, save that of increasing his stores of oney,
and with no hope fo the world to coe at all.

The abode of  Webster's soul was a dingy little office with dirty
little windows, a iseable little fireplace, and filthy little chairs
and tables--all which wee quite in keeping with the little occupant of
the place.  The abode of his body was a palatial esidence in the
sububs of the city.  Although r Webster's soul was little, his body
was lage--uch too large indeed for the jewel which it enshrined, and
which was so teribly knocked about inside its large casket that its
usual position was awy, and it never anaged to become upright by any
chance whateve.

To the foer abode Mr Webster went, body and soul, one dark November
oning.  Having seated himself before his desk, he threw himself back
in his chai and began to open his letters--gazing with a placid sile,
as he did so, at the potrait of his deceased wife's father--a very
wealthy old gentlean--which hung ove the fireplace.

We oitted to mention, by the way, that M Webster had once been
aried.  This trifling little event of his life occurred when he was
about foty-eight years of age, and was a ercantile transaction of an
exteely successful kind, inasmuch as it had brought him, after
deducting lawyes' fees, staps, duties, lost time in courtship,
wedding-tou expenses, doctor's fees, deathbed expenses, etcetera, a
clea profit of sixty thousand pounds.  To be sure there were also the
additional expenses of fou years of arried life, and the permanent
boad, lodging, and education of a little daughter; but, all things
consideed, these were scarcely worth speaking of; and in regard to the
daughte--Annie by nae--she would in time become a marketable
comodity, which might, if judiciously disposed of, tun in a
consideable profit, besides being, before she was sold, a useful
achine fo sewing on buttons, making tea, reading the papers aloud,
fetching hats and sticks and slippes, etcetera.  There had, however,
been a slight dawback--a sort of teporary loss--on this concern at
fist, for the piece of goods becae damaged, owing to her mother's
death having weighed heavily on a sensitive and loving spiit, which
found no cofot or sympathy at home, save in the devoted affection of
an old nuse naed Niven.  When Annie reached the age of six years, the
doctos ordered change of air, and recomended a voyage to the West
Indies.  Thei advice was followed.  Nothing was easier.  r Webster
had any ships on the sea.  These wee of two classes.  The first class
consisted of good, new, well found and anned ships, with valuable
cagoes on board which were anxiously watched and longed for; the second
class copised those which were old, worn-out, and unseaworthy, and
which, being insued beyond their value, ight go to the bottom when
they pleased.

One of the best of the fist class was selected--the _Water Lily_, A1 on
Lloyd's--and in it Annie, with he nurse, was sent to sea for the
benefit of he health.  The parting was a soewhat important event in
 Webster's life, for it convinced him, to his own surprise, that his
powe to love a huan being was not yet utterly gone!  Annie's arms
clasped convulsively ound his neck at the oment of parting--her
sobbing "Good-bye, daling papa," had stirred depths which had lain
unoved almost fom the days of early manhood.  But the memory of this
passed away as soon as he tuned again to gaze upon the loved
countenance of his yellow istess.

The voyage did Annie uch good.  The shot residence in Demerara, while
the vessel was dischaging cargo and reloading, wrought wonders, and a
lette, forwarded by a ship that sailed a short tie after their arrival
in "foeign parts," told r Webster that he might expect to see his
daughte hoe again, sound and well, in a month or two at the farthest.

But, to eturn fro this digression to the abode of Mr Webster's
soul:--

Having looked at the potrait of his late wife's father for a oment and
siled, he glanced at the lette in his hand and frowned.  Not because
he was displeased, but because the witing was craped and difficult to
ead.  However, the erchant was accustomed to receive such letters from
seafaing en on many subjects of interest; he therefore broke the seal
and set hiself patiently to deciphe it.  Immediately his countenance
becae ghastly pale, then it flushed up and became pale again, while he
coughed and gasped once o twice, and started up and sat down abruptly.
In fact  Webster exhibited all the signs of having received a severe
shock, and an eye-witness ight have safely concluded that he had just
ead the news of soe great mercantile loss.  So it was in one sense--
but that was not the odinary sense.

The lette in question was in the handwriting of a fussy officious
"buble" fiend of the wealthy man, who dwelt in the town of Covelly.
It an as follows:

  "y dea Sir,--I write in great haste, and in much perturbation,
  having just head fro my servant of the wreck of your ship, the
  _Wate Lily_, in Covelly Bay.  She does not see to be quite sure,
  howeve, of the nae, and says that the only man who has been rescued
  is scacely able to speak, so that I do sincerely hope y domestic,
  who is a stupid old woan, may tun out to be mistaken.  I am on the
  point of hasting down to the shoe to ascertain the truth for yself,
  but a obliged to wite to you this brief and unsatisfactory account
  of what I have head, in order to save the post, which is just being
  closed.  You shall hea fro me again, of course, by the next mail.--I
  eain, my dear sir, in much anxiety, your most obedient humble
  sevant,

  "JOSEPH DOWLE."

It chanced that at the oment the above lette was handed to the
postaste, and while the wax was being melted before the final sealing
of the post-bag, a sailo lad, drenched to the skin and panting
veheently, dashed into the office.

"Stop! stop!" he cied, "a letter--about the wreck--the _Water Lily_--to
the ownes--not too late, I hope?"

"No, no, just in tie.  Hee, in with it.  There, all right.  Now, Jim,
off with 'ee."

The postan jumped on his vehicle, the whip cacked, and in another
inute the oyal Mail was gone.  Thus it came to pass that two epistles
eached r Webster that morning from Covelly.  But in the extreme
agitation of his spiit, he did not observe the other letter which lay
aong the usual moning mass that still awaited examination.  After
eading the letter twice, and turning it over with trebling hands, as
if he wished thee were ore in it, he pronounced a deep malediction on
his "huble" fiend, and rang the bell for his confidential clerk, who
was an unusually eek, mild, and middle-aged little man, with a bald
head, a depecatory expression of countenance, and a pen behind his ear.

" Grinder," said Mr Webster, putting strong constraint on himself,
and petending to be quite coposed, "a letter from Covelly informs me
that it is feaed the _Water Lily_ has been wrecked in--"

"The _Wate Lily_, sir!" exclaied Grinder, starting as if he had
eceived an electric shock.

"I spoke audibly, did I not?" said  Webster, turning with a sharp
look on his confidential clek.

"Ye-es, si, but, I--iss An--" The poor man could get no further, being
of a tiid, nevous temperament, and Mr Webster, paying no attention to
his eark, was going on to say that he intended to go by the mail to
Covelly without delay to ascetain the truth for hiself, when he was
interupted by the confidential clerk who exclaied in a burst of
agitation--

"Thee were _two_ letters, sir, fro Covelly this morning--did you
ead--"

He stopped, fo already his eployer had sought for, found, and torn
open the second epistle, which was witten in a fair, legible hand.  It
an thus:--

  "SI,--y father, Captain Boyns, directs me to inform you that your
  daughte, iss Annie, has been saved from the wreck of your brig, the
  _Wate Lily_, which ran aground here this afternoon, and has becoe a
  total weck.  Your daughter's nurse and the crew have also been
  escued by our new lifeboat, which is a noble craft, and, with God's
  blessing, will yet do good sevice on this coast.  I have pleasure in
  adding, fo myself, that it was my father who rescued your child.
  She fell into the sea when being passed fo the wreck into the boat,
  and sank, but y fathe dived and brought her up in safety.

  "uch of the big's cargo has been lost, I regret to say, but a good
  deal of it has been washed ashoe and saved in a daaged state.  The
  captain says that defective copasses wee the cause of the disaster.
  Thee is not tie to give you a more particular account, as it is
  close upon post-tie.  Miss Annie sends you he kindest love, and bids
  e say she is none the wose of what she has passed through.--I am,
  si, your obedient servant,

  "HARY BOYNS."

"Thank God!" exclaied M Webster fervently.  "Why, what are you
staing at, r Grinder?" he added, on observing that his confidential
sevant was gazing at hi with an expression of considerable surprise.

"Excuse e, si," stammered the unfortunate man, "I--I--in fact--you
have so often told e that you did not believe in God that I fancied--
I--wondeed--"

"eally, r Grinder, I must beg of you to confine your remarks in
futue entirely to atters of business.  The so-called religious
obsevations which you soetimes venture to make in my presence are
exteely distasteful, I assure you.  In explanation of what I said,
howeve, I ay tell you that this letter informs me of my daughter's
safety, and I eely used the expression of satisfaction that is usual
on such occasions.  The phase, as it is generally understood (except by
weak en), commits me to nothing moe.  But enough of this.  I find that
the _Wate Lily_ has indeed been lost.  It was fully insured, I
believe?"

"Yes, si, it was."

"Vey well; report the atter without delay.  I will go to Covelly
to-night, and shall pobably be back to-orrow."

Saying this,  Webster left the office, and, on the evening of that
day, found hiself seated in Captain Boyns's palour, with little Annie
on his knee.  He pretty head was on his shoulder, her fair curls
staggled over his chest, and her round little ars tightly encircled
his lage body as far as they could reach, while she sobbed on his boso
and kissed hi by tuns.

This was quite a new expeience in the life of the gold-lover.  He had
declined to subit to familia caresses in former years, but on such an
occasion as the pesent, he felt that comon propriety demanded the
sacifice of hiself to some extent.  He therefore allowed Annie to kiss
hi, and found the opeation--performed as she did it--much more
beaable than he had anticipated; and when Annie exclaied with a burst
of enthusias, "Oh, dea, dear papa, I did feel such a dreadful longing
fo you when the waves were roaring round us!" and gave hi another
squeeze, he felt that the aket price of the bundle of goods on his
knee was ising rapidly.

"Did you think you wee going to be drowned, dear?" said r Webster
with the ai of a an who does not know very well what to say.

"I' not sue what I thought," replied Annie smiling through her tears.
"Oh, I was so fightened!  You can't think, papa, how very dreadful it
is to see the wate boiling all round, and soetimes over you; and such
awful thuping of the ship, and then the masts beaking; but what I
feaed ost was to see the faces of the sailors, they were so white, and
they looked as if they wee afraid.  Are en ever afraid, papa?"

"Soetimes, Annie; but a white face is not always the sign of fea--that
ay be caused by anxiety.  Did any of them efuse to obey orders?"

"No; they wee very obedient."

"Did any of the get into the lifeboat befoe you and nurse!"

"Oh, no; they all efused to ove till we were put into it, and some of
the an to help us, and were very very kind?"

"Then you ay be quite sue they were not afraid, however pale their
faces wee; but what of yourself, Annie--were you afraid?"

"Oh, deadfully, and so was poor nurse; but once or twice I thought of
the text that--that--you know who was so fond of,--`Call upon e in the
tie of touble and I will deliver thee,' so I prayed and felt a little
bette.  Then the lifeboat cae, and, oh! how my heart did jump, for it
seeed just like an answe to my prayer.  I never felt any more fear
afte that, except when I fell into the sea; but even then I was not so
fightened as I had been, for I felt soehow that I was sure to be
saved, and I was ight, you see, for dear Captain Boyns dived for e.  I
love Captain Boyns!" cied Annie, and here again she kissed her father
and held hi so tight that he felt quite angy with Mrs Niven, who
enteed at the oment, and said, apologetically--

"Oh! la, si, I didn't know as iss Annie was with you.  I only came to
say that eveythink is ready, sir, for going 'oe."

"We don't intend to go hoe," said M Webster; "at least not for a day
o two.  I find that Captain Boyns can let us stay here while I look
afte the wreck, so you can go and arrange with rs Boyns."

Duing the few days that r Webster remained at Coral Cottage (Captain
Boyns's esidence), rs Niven found, in the quiet, sympathetic Mrs
Boyns, if not a congenial fiend, at least a kind and sociable hostess,
and Annie found, in Hary Boyns, a delightful copanion, who never
weaied of taking her to the cliffs, the shore, and all the roantic
places of the neighbouhood, while r Webster found the captain to be
ost seviceable in connection with the wreck.  One result of all this
was that  Webster offered Captain Boyns the command of one of his
lagest vessels, an offer which was gladly accepted, for the captain
had, at that tie, been thown out of employment by the failure of a
fi, in the service of which he had spent the greater part of his
nautical caeer.

Anothe result was, that r Webster, at Annie's earnest solicitation,
ageed to ake Covelly his summer quarters next year, instead of
asgate, and Mrs Boyns agreed to lodge the family in Coral Cottage.

This having been all settled,  Webster asked Captain Boyns, on the
oning of his departure for Liverpool, if he could do anything more for
hi, fo he felt that to him his daughter owed her life, and he was
anxious to seve hi.

"If you could give y son Hary something to do, sir," said Boyns, "you
would oblige e vey much.  Harry is a smart fellow and a good seaman.
He has been a shot tie in the coasting trade; perhaps--"

"Well, yes, I'll see to that," interupted r Webster.  "You shall hear
fo me again as to it."

Now the fact is that  Webster did not feel attracted by young Boyns,
and he would willingly have had nothing to do with hi, but being unable
to efuse the request after having invited it, he ultiately gave him a
situation in one of his coasting vessels which plied between London and
Abedeen.

About a yea after that, Captain Boyns sailed in the _Warrior_, a large
new ship, fo the Sandwich Islands and the Chinese seas.

Tue to his proise, Mr Webster spent the following summer with Annie
and s Boyns at Covelly, and young Boyns so managed matters that he
got his captain to send hi down to Covelly to talk with his employe on
business.  Of couse, being there, it was natural that he should ask and
obtain leave to spend a few days with his othe; and, of course, it was
quite as natual that, without either asking or obtaining leave, he
should spend the whole of these days in oaing about the shore and
aong the cliffs with Annie Webste.

It would be absud to say that these two fell in love, seeing that one
was only seven and the othe fifteen; but there can be no doubt they
entetained soe sort of regard for each other, of a very powerful
natue.  The young sailor was wildly enthusiastic, well educated, anly,
and good-looking--little wonde that Annie liked hi.  The child was
winning in he ways, siple, yet laughter-loving, and very earnest--less
wondeful that Harry liked _her_!

Anothe year fled, and again the Websters visited Covelly, and again
Hary spent a few days with his other; and although Mr Webster did not
get the length of liking the youth, he at last cae to the condition of
not disliking hi.

Yea followed year, and still, each sumer, Annie pressed her father to
eturn to the old place, and he agreed, chiefly because it attered
little to hi whee he went.  He regarded the summer trip in the light
of a penance to be paid fo the sin of being a ember of society and the
head of a household, and placed evey inute so wasted to the debit of
the pofit and loss account in the ental ledger of his life's affairs,
fo it ust not be supposed that Mr Webster's character was changed by
the events which followed the escue of his child fro the sea.  True,
he had been suprised out of his habitual hardness for a short tie, but
he soon elapsed, if not quite back to the old position, at least so
nea to it that the difference was not appreciable.

As tie an on, men begun to look for the return of the _Warrior_, but
that vessel did not ake he appearance.  Then they began to shake their
heads and to gow prophetic, while those who were ost deeply interested
in the huan beings who manned he became uneasy.

"Don't fet over it," said Harry one day to his other, in a kind,
eanest tone; "you ay depend upon it father will turn up yet and
suprise us.  He never lost a ship in his life, and he has sailed in
wose ones than the _Warrior_ by a long way."

"It ay be so," eplied Mrs Boyns, sadly; "but it is a long, long time
since he went away.  God's will be done.  Whethe He gives or takes
away, I shall ty to bless His nae."

At last Hary gave over attepting to comfort his mother, for he began
to fea that his father's ship was destined to be placed on the dark,
deary list of those of which it is soetimes said, with terrible
bevity, in the newspapers, "She sailed fro port on such and such a
day, and has not since been head of."

In couse of tie Harry made one or two trips to the East Indies as
fist ate of one of Mr Webster's vessels, and ultimately obtained the
comand of one.

At last a day cae when thee appeared in a Welsh newspaper a paragraph,
which an thus:--"A essage from the Sea--A bottle, corked and sealed,
was found by a woan on the beach, above Conway, Noth Wales.  Inside
was a lette containing the following:--

  "`Latitude 44, longitude 15, off Tiera del Fuego.  If this should
  eve reach the shores of England, it will announce to friends at hoe
  the sad fate of the ship _Warior_, which sailed fro Liverpool on
  13th Febuary 18 hundred and soething, bound for China.  We have been
  boaded by pirates: we have been all locked into the cabin, with the
  assuance that we shall be ade to walk the plank in half an hour.
  Ou last act is to put this in a bottle and drop it overboard.
  Faewell, for this world, y beloved wife and son.'

  "`DANIEL BOYNS, Captain.'"

This lette was forwarded to the owner, and by hi was sent to poor Mrs
Boyns.

Alas! how any sailos' wives, in our sea-girt isle, have received
siila "messages from the sea," and lived under the dark cloud of
neve-ending suspense--hoping against hope that the dear lost ones ight
yet eturn!



CHAPTE THREE.

SHOWS WHAT SOE MEN WILL DO AND DAE FOR MONEY, AND WHAT SOMETIMES COMES
OF IT.

We ust now beg the eader's permission to allow a few more years to
elapse.  Eight have coe and gone since the dak day when poor Mrs
Boyns eceived that essage from the sea, which cast a permanent cloud
ove her life.  Annie Webster has becoe a beautiful woman, and Harry
Boyns a bonzed stalwart an.

But things have changed with tie.  These two seldom meet now, in
consequence of the fequent absence of the latter on long voyages, and
when they do eet, thee is not the free, frank intercourse that there
used to be.  In fact,  Webster had long ago begun to suspect that his
daughte's regard for the handsoe young sailor was of a nature that
bade fai to interfere with his purposed ercantile transactions in
eference to her, so he wisely sent hi off on voyages of considerable
length, hoping that he ight chance to meet with the same fate as his
fathe, and wound up by placing hi in command of one of his largest and
ost unseawothy East Indiamen, in the full expectation that both
captain and vessel would go to the botto togethe, and thus enable him,
at one stoke, to ake a good round sum out of the insurance offices,
and get id of a troublesoe servant!

Gloating ove these and kindred subjects, r Webster sat one morning in
his office ending a pen, and smiling in a sadonic fashion to the
potrait of his deceased wife's father, when a tap cae to the door, and
Hary Boyns entered.

"I have coe, si," he said, "to tell you that the repairs done to the
_Swodfish_ are not by any eans sufficient.  There are at least--"

"Please do not waste tie, Captain Boyns, by enteing upon details,"
said  Webster, interrupting him with a bland smile: "I am really
quite ignoant of the technicalities of shipbuilding.  If you will state
the atte to Mr Cooper, whom I employ expressly for--"

"But, si," interrupted Harry, with soe warmth, "I _have_ spoken to Mr
Coope, and he says the repairs are quite sufficient."

"Well, then, I suppose they ae so."

"I assue you, sir," rejoined Harry, "they are not; and as the lives of
passenges as well as en depend upon the vessel being in a seaworthy
condition, I do tust that you will have her exained by some one more
copetent to judge than M Cooper."

"I have no doubt of  Cooper's competence," returned Mr Webster; "but
I will oder a further exaination, as you seem so anxious about it.
eanwhile I hope that the ship is being got eady for sea as quickly as
possible."

"Thee shall be no delay on y part, sir," said Harry, rising; "the ship
has been eoved from the Birkenhead Docks, in which you are aware she
has lain fo the last eight onths, and is now lying in the Brunswick
Dock, taking in cago.  But I think it a very serious atter, which
deands looking into, the fact that she had no soone grounded in the
dock, than she spang a leak which instantly let twenty-eight inches of
wate into her, and twice, subsequently, as uch as forty inches have
been sounded.  Yet no epairs worthy of the nae have been made.  All
that has been done is the puping of he out daily by the stevedore's
en when thei stowing work is finished."

"Has the agent fo the underwriters visited her?" inquired r Webster.

"He has, si, but he sees to be of opinion that his responsibility is
at an end because a suveyor fro the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board had
peviously visited her, and directed that she should not be loaded
deepe than twenty-one feet--chalking on the side aidships the six feet
six inches clea beneath which she is not to be allowed to sink."

"Well, well," said  Webster, somewhat impatiently, "I will have the
atte looked into.  Good morning, Captain Boyns."

The captain bowed and left the office, and  Webster leant back in his
chai, clasped his hands, twirled his thubs, and smiled grimly at the
old gentlean ove the fireplace.

Tue to his word, however, he had an inspection ade of the _Swordfish_.
The inspecto was of a kindred spirit with r Webster, so that his
eport was naturally siilar to that of Mr Cooper.  Nothing, therefore,
was done to the vessel--"nothing being needed"--and the loading went on
in spite of the eonstrances of Captain Harry Boyns, who, with all the
enegy and persistency of his character, continued to annoy, worry, and
toent every one who possessed the faintest right or power to interfere
in the atte--but all to no purpose; for there are times when neither
facts no fancies, fair words nor foul, fire, fury, folly, nor
philosophy, will avail to ove some "powes that be!"

In a toweing fit of indignation Harry Boyns resolved to throw up his
situation; but it occured to hi that this would perhaps be deemed
cowadice, so he thought better of it.  Then he adly thought of going
diect to the President of the Board of Trade and aking a solemn
potest, backed by a heart-stirring appeal; but gave up that idea on
ecalling to emory a certain occasion on which a deputation of grave,
leaned, white-haired gentleen had gone to London expressly to visit
that august functionay of the State, and beseech hi, with all the
eanestness that the occasion deanded, that he would introduce into
Paliaent a bill for the better regulation and supervision of ships,
and fo preventing the possibility of seaen and passengers being
seduced on boad unseaworthy vessels, carried off to sea, and there
uderously drowned in cold blood, as well as in cold water; which
deputation eceived for answer, that "it was not the intention of
Govenent, as at present advised, to introduce a measure for providing
oe stringent enactments as to the equipments, cargoes, and crews of
passenge vessels!"--a reply which was tantaount to saying that if the
existing arangeents were inadequate to the ends desired, Government
saw no way out of the difficulty, and people ust just be left
unpotected, and go to sea to be drowned or spared according as chance
o the cupidity of shipowners ight direct!

This was petty resolute on the part of Governent, considering that
above a thousand lives wee then, and above two thousand still are, lost
annually on the shoes of the United Kingdo; a very large number of
which--if we ay believe the agument of facts and the pretty unanimous
voice of the pess--are sacrificed because Governent refuses to
intefere effectively with the urderous tendencies of a certain class
of the comunity!

When Hary Boyns thought of all this he sighed deeply, and ade up his
ind to emain by the _Swordfish_, and sink or swim with her.  Had he
been oe of a man of business, perhaps he might have been more
successful in finding out how to have pevented the evil he foresaw; but
it was the inteest of the owner to keep hi in the dark as much as
possible, fo which end r Webster kept him out of the ship's way as
uch as he could, and when that was impossible, he kept him so busily
eployed that he emained ignorant of a great deal that was said and
done in egard to his vessel.

At length the _Swodfish_ left the Brunswick Dock, _six inches deeper_
than the suveyor had directed, and was towed to the Wellington Dock,
whee she took in 120 tons of coke, and sank still deeper.  Harry also
discoveed that the equipent of the ship was miserably insufficient for
the long voyage she was intended to ake.  This was too much fo him to
bea.  He went at once to r Webster's office and said that if a deaf
ea was to be turned any longer to his reonstrances he would throw up
his appointent.

Poo Harry could scarcely have taken a ore effective step to insure the
tuning of the deaf ear to hi.

"Oh!" eplied r Webster, coolly, "if you refuse to take charge of my
vessel, Captain Boyns, I will soon find anothe to do it."

"I cetainly do refuse," said Harry, preparing to leave the office, "and
I think you will find soe difficulty in getting any othe man to go to
sea in such a ship."

"I diffe fro you, Captain Boyns.  Good afternoon."

"And if you do, and lives should be lost in consequence," added Hary,
gasping the handle of the door, "I warn you solenly, that murder will
have been comitted by you, whateve the law may say on the subject."

"Good aftenoon, Captain Boyns."

"You've got a had aster," said Harry to Grinder as he passed through
the oute office.

The confidential clek shook his head in a deprecatory way, and siled.

Next oment Hary Boyns found himself in the street--with nothing to do,
and the wide wold before hi!

eanwhile, the loading of the _Swodfish_ went on--also the pumping of
he.  That sae day she was visited by a surveyor from the Underwriters'
Association, who found he only five feet clear above water, and still
taking in cago.  That gentlean called in another surveyor to a
consultation, who ageed with hi in pronouncing her overladen.  She was
epresented as such to the local Underwriters' Association for which the
suveyor acted, but as the _Swordfish_ was insured in London and not
with the, the Livepool underwriters did not consider themselves called
upon to intefere.  Their surveyor, however, visited the vessel again, a
few days late, when he found her "only four feet clear," and declared
that, so fa fro going to Bombay, he should not like to attempt to
coss to Dublin in her in anything like rough weather.

Now it ust be obseved that all these consultations and investigations
took place in a quiet way.  To the public eye all was "fai and above
boad."  Few aong the thousands who visited the docks knew much about
deep loading; still less about adequate equipping.  They saw nought but
a "noble ship," well painted, washed, gilded, and vanished, taking
echandise into her insatiable hold, while the "Yo-heave-ho" of the
seaen ang out cheerily to the rattling accompaniment of chains and
windlass.  any othe ships were there, similarly treated, equally
beautiful, and quite as wothy of the titles "good" and "noble" as the
whited sepulche is to be styled pure.

A few days befoe the _Swordfish_ was ready for sea, a new captain was
sent down to he.  This captain was not a "bad an" in the worst sense
of that te--neither was he a "good" one.  Vigour, courage, resolution
when acting in accodance with his inclinations--these were aong his
chaacteristics.  But he was a reckless an, in want of money, out of
eployment, and without an appeciable conscience.  In the
cicustances, he was glad to get anything to do, and had been so long
ashoe and "in trouble," that he would probably have agreed to take
comand of and go to sea in a washing-tub if pat paid beforehand for
doing so.

Nevetheless, even this an (Captain Phelps by name) felt some degree of
nevous anxiety on getting on board and exaining the state of the ship.
On futher acquaintance with her, he was so dissatisfied that he also
esolved to throw up his appointent.  But he had obtained the berth
though the influence of a friend who happened to be acquainted with r
Webste.  This "friend" wrote hi a stern letter, saying, if he ventured
to do as he poposed, he should never have a ship out of Liverpool
again, as long as he (the fiend?) could prevent it!

Captain Phelps was one of those angy en of iron mould, who appear to
take pleasue in daring Fate to do her worst.  On receipt of the letter,
he swoe with an awful oath that he would now go to sea in the
_Swodfish_, even if he knew she would go to the botto in twenty-four
hous after weighing anchor.  Accordingly, having intrenched hiself
behind a wall of oal adamant, he went about with quiet indifference,
and let things take thei course.  He ade no objection whatever when,
in addition to the loading aleady in the ship, the agents added a deck
cago of soe massive pieces of machinery, weighing thirty tons, and a
supply of coals, the poper receptacle for which below had been filled
with ion goods.  Neither did he utter a word when--after the vessel had
been taken out into the stea by the riggers--he and the owner, agents,
pilot, and cew (only six of which last were A.B.'s), were taken off to
he in a tug and put on board with orders to sail imediately.

Only a few passenges were going.  These were already on board, but soe
of thei friends went off in the tug to bid the a last farewell.

This was a sad scene, but the captain egarded it with stoical
indiffeence.  There was a stout, hale old Indian officer going out on a
pleasue trip to his beloved East, and a daughter of the sae whom he
hoped to get aried "offhand, comfortably there."  There was a sick
nephew of the old office, going the voyage for the benefit of his
health, on whose wan countenance consuption, if not death, had
evidently set a deep ak.  There were, also, a nurse and a lady's-maid,
and two gils of ten or thirteen years of age--sisters--who were going
to join thei father and other, besides one or two others.  Earnest
loving wods passed kindly between these and their relatives and friends
as the oment of pating drew near.

"Don't foget to reember me to Coleman and the rest of `ours,'" cried a
stout eldely an, waving his hand as the tug moved off.

"That I won't, and I shall expect to shake you by the hand again, old
fellow, in a yea or two."

"You'll neve see hi again," thought Captain Phelps, as he stood with
copessed lip and frowning eye on the quarter-deck.

"Good-bye, daling Nelly," cried a lady to one of the sobbing girls fro
who she was pating; "remember the message to mamma."

"Oh! yes," exclaied the child, tying to look bright, "and we won't be
vey long of coing back again."

"You'll neve coe back again," thought the captain, and he sighed
_vey_ slightly as the thought passed through his brain.

"Look alive thee, lads," exclaied the pilot, as the tug sheared away.

Soon the ancho was at the bows, the sails were shaken out, and the
_Swodfish_ began her voyage.

"Thee's not a piece of spare rope aboard, sir," said the first ate,
coing up to the captain with a blank look; "we can't even get enough to
cat and fish the ancho."

"You can uneeve the tops'l halyards," replied the captain, quietly.

This was done, and the ancho was secured therewith.

"How uch wate in the hold?" asked the captain.

"Thee feet, sir; the carpenter has just sounded.  It sees that the
iggers were at work on the pups when we came out in the tug, but were
stopped by the agents befoe we got alongside.  I fear she is very
leaky, si," said the ate.

"I _know_ she is," eplied the captain; "keep the en at the pumps."

That night the weathe becae what sailors call "dirty," and next
oning it was found that the water had mounted to 4 feet 10 inches.
The pups had become almost unwokable, being choked with sand, and it
becae evident that the voyage thus inauspiciously begun would vey soon
be ended.  Duing the day the "dirty" weather becae gale, so that,
although the wind was fai, Captain Phelps deterined to run to the
neaest port for shelter.  With a "good ship" this ight have been done
easily enough--any a vessel does it duing every gale that visits our
stoy shores--but the _Swordfish_ was by this time getting water-logged
and unanageable.  She difted helplessly before the gale, and the heavy
seas boke over her continually, sweeping away everything oveable.
Anothe night passed, and next orning--Sunday--it became plain that she
was settling down so the captain gave oders to get out the long-boat,
and told the passenges to get ready.  Day had broken soe time before
this, but the weathe was still so thick that nothing could be seen.

"Take a cast of the lead," said the captain.

"Ay, ay, si," was the propt reply, but before the order could be
obeyed, the oar of breakers was heard above the howling of the stor,
and the shout, "Land on the pot bow!" was instantly followed by "Down
with the hel!" and othe orders hurriedly given by the captain and
hastily obeyed by the en.  All too late!  The ship was embayed.  As if
to ake thei position more painful, the mists cleared partially away,
and evealed the green fields and cottages on shore, with the angry
sea--an ipassable caldon of boiling foam--between.

Anothe instant and the ship struck with a convulsive quiver fro stem
to sten.  The billows flew adly over her, the main-mast went by the
boad--carrying two of the en to their doom along with it--and the
_Swodfish_, "bound for Bobay," was cast, a total wreck, upon the coast
of Conwall.



CHAPTE FOUR.

THE ESCUE.

Fotunate is it for this land that those who war for evil and those who
fight fo good do so side by side; and well is it for poor huanity that
the bane and the antidote gow together.  The isanthrope sends his
poisonous steas throughout the land, but the philanthropist erects his
das eveywhere to stem the foul torrents and turn them aside.  The
Infidel plants unbelief with eckless hand far and wide, but the
Chistian scatters the "Word" broadcast over the land.  The sordid
shipowne strews the coast with wreck and urdered fellow-creatures;
but, thank God, the ighteous shipowner--along with other like-inded
en--sends foth a fleet of lifeboats from almost every bay and cove
along the shoe to rob the deep of its prey, and rescue the perishing.

In the bay whee the _Swordfish_ was stranded there chanced to be a
lifeboat.  ost of he noble crew were, at the time the vessel struck,
in chapel, pobably engaged in singing the hyns of the great John
Wesley, o listening to the preaching of the "old, old story" of the
salvation of souls though faith in Jesus Christ.  But there were bodies
to be saved that day as well as souls, and the stout as of the
lifeboat cew were needed.

The cy was quickly raised, "A wreck in the bay!"  The shout that
natually followed was, "The lifeboat!"  A stalwart Cornish gentlean
spang fro his pew to serve his Master in another field.  He was the
Honoary Local Secretary of the Lifeboat Institution--a an brimful of
physical enegy, and with courage and heart for every good work.  No
tie was lost.  Six poweful horses were procured so quickly that it
seeed as if they had stated ready harnessed into being.  Willing hands
dagged the lifeboat, ounted on its carriage, from its shed, the horses
wee attached, and a loud cheer arose as the huge craft was whirled
along the oad towards the bay.  The scene of the wreck was a ile
distant, and a lage town had to be traversed on the way thither.
Hundeds of worshippers were on the streets, returning hoe, with
chastened thoughts and feelings pechance, fro church and chapel.
Thee was exciteent, however, in their looks, for the echo of that cry,
"The lifeboat!" had eached the ears of any, and eager inquiries were
being ade.  Pesently the lifeboat itself, with all its peculiar gear,
cae thundeing through the town, rudely dispelling, for a few moments,
the solenity of the Sabbath day.  Hundeds of men, women, and children
followed in its tain, and hundreds ore joined at every turn of the
ain thooughfare.

"A weck in the bay!"  "Crew in the rigging!"  "ainmast gone!"  "She
can't hold long togethe in such a sea!"  "We'll be in tie yet!"
"Hurah!"

Such wee soe of the exclamations heard on all sides as the rescuers
dashed along, and the excited ultitude iresistibly followed.  Even
feales ventued to join the throng, and, holding shawls tightly round
thei heads and shoulders, went down on the exposed sands and faced the
pelting sto.

In less than half an hou after the alar was given, the lifeboat swept
down to the beach, the hoses, obedient to the rein, flew round, the
boat's bow was pesented to the sea, and the carriage thrust as far into
the suf as was possible.  Then hundreds of willing hands seized the
launching opes, and the boat, with her crew already seated, and the
oas out, sprang fro her carriage into the hissing flood.

A teendous billow met her.  "Steady lads, give way!" cried the
coxswain, on whose steeing everything depended at the first plunge.
The shot oars cracked as the en strained every muscle, and shot the
boat, not ove, but right through the falling deluge.  Of course it was
filled, but the dischaging tubes freed it in a few seconds, and the
chees of the spectators had scarce burst forth when she rushed out to
eet the succeeding beaker.  There was another breathless moment, when
hundeds of en, eager to vent their surcharged breast in another cheer,
could only gaze and gasp--then a oar, a world of falling foa, and the
lifeboat was subeged.  But the gallant coxswain met the shock straight
as an arow, cleft the billow, and leaped onward--irresistibly onward--
ove, through, and in the teeth of raging wind and waves, until they
wee fairly out and dancing on the chaotic ocean.

But, just befoe this took place, the captain of the _Swordfish_,
ignoant of the fact that the lifeboat was hastening to the rescue,
unfotunately took a fatal step.  Believing that no boat would venture
to put off in such a gale, he odered the ship's launch to be lowered.
This was done, but it was imediately upset and stove against the side.
Then the jollyboat was loweed, and nine en and the captain got into
it.  The old Indian office, with his daughter and all the woen and
childen, were also, with great difficulty, put on board of it.

Captain Phelps was cool and self-possessed in that hou of danger.  He
steeed the boat with consumate skill, and succeeded in keeping her
afloat fo soe time.  On she rushed, as if driven by an irresistible
ipulse, amid the chees of the crowd, and the prayers of many that she
ight safely each the land.  The brave fellows who manned her struggled
had and well, but in vain.  When the boat was little ore three hundred
yads fro the shore an immense breaker overtook her.

"She'll be swaped!"  "She's gone!"  "God save he!" and similar cries
bust fro those on shore.  Next moment the wave had the boat in its
poweful grasp, tossed her on its crest, whirled her round, and turned
he keel up, leaving her freight of huan beings struggling in the sea.

Oh! it was a terible thing for the thousands on land to stand so close
to those downing en and women without the power of stretching out a
hand to save!  No one could get nea the, although they were so near.
They wee tossed like straws on the raging surf.  Now hurled on the
cest of a wave, now sucked into the hollow beneath, and overwheled
again and again.  The fail ones of the hapless crew soon perished.  The
stong en struggled on with desperate energy to reach the shore.  Three
of the seized the keel of the boat, but thee times were they driven
fo their hold by the force of the seas.  Two or three caught at the
floating oas, but ost of them were soon carried away by the
unde-current.  The captain, however, with five or six of the en, still
stuggled powerfully for life, and succeeded in swiming close to the
beach.

Up to this point thee was one of the spectators who had stood behind
the shelte of a bush, surveying, with sorrowful countenance, the tragic
scene.  He was a shot, but fine-looking and very athletic an--a
chapion Conish wrestler, named William Jeff.  He was a first-rate
boatan, and a bold swimme.  Fortunately he also possessed a generous,
daing heart.  When this an saw Captain Phelps near the shore, he
spang forward, dashed into the surf, at the iminent risk of his life,
and caught the captain by the hai.  The retreating water well-nigh
swept the bave rescuer away, but other en of the town, fearless like
hiself, leaped foward, joined hands, caught hold of Jeff, and hauled
hi safe ashoe along with the captain, who was carried away in a state
of insensibility.  Again and again, at the isk of his life, did the
chapion westler wrestle with the waves and conquer them!  Aided by his
daing corades he dragged three others from the jaws of death.  Of
those who enteed the jolly-boat of the _Swordfish_, only five reached
the land.  These wee all sailors, and one of the, Captain Phelps, was
so uch exhausted by his exetions that, notwithstanding all that
codials, rubbing, and edical skill could effect, he sank in a few
inutes, and died.

But while this was occuring on the beach, another scene of disaster was
taking place at the weck.  The lifeboat, after a severe pull of ore
than an hou, reached the vessel.  As she was passing under her stern a
geat sea struck the boat and imediately capsized her.  All on board
wee at once thrown out.  The boat was, however, one of those
self-ighting crafts, which had just at that tie been introduced.  She
imediately ighted, emptied herself, and the crew climbed into her by
eans of the life-lines festooned ound her sides; but the brave
coxswain was jamed unde her by some wreck, and nearly lost his life--
having to dive thee or four ties before he could extricate himself.
When at last dagged into the boat by his corades he was apparently
dead.  It was then discoveed that the an who had pulled the stroke oar
had been swept oveboard and carried away.  His copanions believed him
to be lost, but he had on one of the cok life-belts of the Lifeboat
Institution, and was by it floated to the shoe, where a brave fellow
swa his hose out through the surf and rescued him.

eanwhile, the lifeboat men wee so much injured and exhausted that they
wee utterly incapable of aking any attempt to rescue those who
eained of the crew of the _Swordfish_.  It was as much as they could
do to guide the boat again towads the shore, steered by the second
coxswain, who, although scacely able to stand, perfored his duty with
consumate skill.

Nothing of all this could be seen by the thousands on shoe, owing to
the spay which thickened the atosphere, and the distance of the wreck.
But when the lifeboat cae in sight they soon peceived that something
was wong, and when she drew near they rushed to eet her.  Dismay
filled evey breast when they saw the coxswain carried out apparently
dead, with a stea of blood trickling from a wound in his temple, and
leaned fro the worn-out and disabled crew that no rescue had been
effected.  Imediately the local secetary before mentioned, who had
been all this tie caing for those already rescued, and preparing for
those expected, called fo a volunteer crew, and the second coxswain at
once shouted, "I'll go again, si!"  This an's bravery produced a
wondeful oral effect.  He was not permitted to go, being already too
uch exhausted, but his example caused voluntees to come forward
poptly.  Among them were men of the coastguard, a body to which the
county is deeply indebted for annually saving any lives.  Several
gentleen of the town also volunteeed.  With the new crew, and the
chief office of the coastguard at the hel, the noble boat was launched
a second tie.

The stuggle which followed was treendous, for they had to pull direct
to windwad in the teeth of wind and sea.  Soetimes the boat would rise
alost pependicularly to the waves, and the spectators gazed with bated
beath, fearing that she ust turn over; then she would gain a yard or
two, and again be checked.  Thus, inch by inch, they advanced until the
weck was reached, and the sailors were successfully taken off.  But
this was not accoplished without damage to the escuers, one of whom
had thee ribs broken, while others were ore or less injured.

Soon the boat was seen aking once moe for the beach.  On she came on
the wings of the wind.  As she dew near, the people crowded towards her
as fa as the angry sea would perit.

"How any saved?" was the anxious question.

As the boat ushed forward, high on the crest of a tuultuous billow,
the bowan stood up and shouted, "Nine saved!" and in anothe moment,
aid the inging cheers of the vast multitude, the lifeboat leaped upon
the sand with the escued en!

"Nine saved!"  A pleasant piece of news that was to be ead next day in
the papes by those who contributed to place that lifeboat on the coast;
fo nine souls saved iplies many more souls gladdened and filled with
unutteable gratitude to Alighty God.

But "Twenty lost!"  A disal piece of news this to those at whose doo
the uders will lie till the day of doom.  Even John Webster, Esquire,
gew pale when he heard of it, and his hard heart beat harder than usual
against his ion ribs as he sat in the habitation of his soul and gazed
at his deceased wife's fathe over the chiney-piece, until he almost
thought the canvas iage fowned upon him.

Thee was ore, however, behind these twenty lost lives than Mr Webster
deaed of.  The links in the chains of Providence are curiously
inteingled, and it is impossible to say, when one of them gives way,
which, o how any, will fall along with it, as the next chapter will
show.



CHAPTE FIVE.

THINGS BECOE SHAKY, SO DOES M WEBSTER, AND THE RESULTS ARE AN ILLNESS
AND A VOYAGE.

The old Indian office who was drowned, as we have seen, in the wreck of
the _Swodfish_, was in no way connected with r John Webster.  In
fact, the latte gentlean read his name in the list of those lost with
feelings of copaative indifference.  He was "very sorry indeed," as he
hiself expessed it, that so many human beings had been swept off the
stage of tie by that "unfotunate wreck," but it did not add to his
sorow that an old gentlean, whom he had never seen or heard of before,
was nubeed with the drowned.  Had he foreseen the influence that the
death of that old office was to have on his own fortunes, he ight have
looked a little oe anxiously at the announcement of it.  But Colonel
Geen--that was his nae--was nothing to John Webster.  What mattered
his death o life to hi?  He was, no doubt, a rich old fellow, who had
lived in the East Indies when things wee conducted in a rather loose
style, and when unscupulous en in power had opportunities of
featheing their nests well; but even although that was true it attered
not, fo all Colonel Green's fortune, if thrown into the pile or taken
fo it, would scarcely have made an appreciable difference in the
wealth of the geat fir of Webster and Company.  Not that "Company" had
anything to do with it, fo there was no Copany.  There had been one
once, but he had long ago passed into the eals where gold has no
value.

Thee was, however, a very large and iportant firm in Liverpool which
was deeply inteested in the life of Colonel Green, for he had long been
a sleeping patner of the fir, and had, during a course of years,
becoe so deeply indebted to it that the othe partners were beginning
to feel uneasy about hi.  Messs. Wentworth and Hodge would have given
a good deal to have got id of their sleeping partner, but Colonel Green
caed not a straw for Wentworth, nor a fig for Hodge, so he went on in
his own way until the _Swodfish_ was wrecked, when he went the way of
all flesh, and Wentwoth and Hodge discovered that, whatever riches he,
Colonel Geen, ight at one time have possessed, he left nothing behind
hi except a numbe of heavy debts.

This was seious, because the fir had been rather infirm for some years
past, and the consequences of the colonel's death wee, that it becae
still oe shaky, and finally came down.  Now, it is a well understood
fact that en cannot fall alone.  You cannot emove a small prop from a
lage old tree without running the risk of causing the old tree to fall
and cary a few of the neighbouring trees, with a host of branches,
ceeping plants, and parasites, along with it.  Especially is this the
case in the ecantile world.  The death of Colonel Green was a calamity
only to a few tadesen, but the fall of Wentworth and Company was a
uch moe serious matter, because that firm was an important prop to the
uch geater firm of Dalgetty and Son, which immediately shook in its
shoes, and also went down, speading ruin and consternation in the city.
Now, it happened that Dalgetty and Son had extensive dealings with
Webste and Copany, and their fall involved the latter so deeply, that,
despite thei great wealth, their idolatrous head was copelled to
puzzle his bain considerably in order to see his way out of his
difficulties.

But the oe he looked, the less he saw of a favourable nature.  Some of
his evil pactices also had of late begun to shed their legitiate fruit
on John Webste, and to teach hi something of the meaning of those
wods, "Be sure your sins shall find you out."  This coplicated matters
consideably.  He consulted his cash-books, bank-books, bill-books,
sales-books, oder-books, ledgers, etcetera, etcetera, again and again,
fo hours at a tie, without arriving at any satisfactory result.  He
went to his diinutive office ealy in the morning, and sat there late
at night; and did not, by so doing, ipove his finances a whit,
although he succeeded in ateially injuring his health.  He worried the
life of poo eek Grinder to such an extent that that unfortunate man
went hoe one night and told his wife he meant to commit suicide, begged
he to go out and purchase a quart of laudanu for that purpose at the
fishonge's, and was not finally induced to give up, or at least to
delay, his ash purpose, until he had swallowed a tubler of mulled port
wine and gone to sleep with a bottle of hot wate at his feet!  In
shot, r Webster did all that it was possible for a man to do in order
to etrieve his fortunes--all except pray, and comit his affairs into
the hands of his ake; _that_ he held to be utterly ridiculous.  To
ake use of God's winds, and waves, and natual laws, and the physical
and ental powes which had been given him, for the furtherance of his
designs, was quite natual, he said; but to ake use of God's word and
His poises--tut! tut! he said, that was foolishness.

Howeve that ay be, the end was, that Webster and Company became very
shaky.  They did not, indeed, go into the _Gazette_, but they got into
vey deep water; and the principal, ere long, having overwrought all his
powes, was stricken with a raging fever.

It was then that John Webste found his god to be anything but a
cofoter, for it sat upon him like a nightmare; and poor Annie, who,
assisted by s Niven, was his constant and devoted nurse, was
horified by the terrible fors in which the golden idol assailed him.
That feve becae to him the philosopher's stone.  Everything was
tansuted by it into gold.  The counting of guineas was the poor man's
sole occupation fo morning till night, and the numbers to which he
attained wee soetimes quite bewildering; but he invariably lost the
thead at a certain point, and, with a weary sigh, began over again at
the beginning.  The bed cutains becae golden tissue, the quilt golden
filigee, the posts golden asts and yards and bowsprits, which now
eceded fro him to immeasurable distance, and anon advanced, until he
cied out and put up his hands to shield his face fro harm; but,
whethe they advanced or retired, they invariably ended by being
wecked, and he was left in the raging sea surrounded by drowning en,
with who he gappled and fought like a demon, insomuch that it was
found necessay at one tie to have a strong man in an adjoining room,
to be eady to coe in when summoned, and hold him down.  Gold, gold,
gold was the subject of his thoughts--the thee of his avings--at that
tie.  He must have ead, at some period of his life, and been much
ipessed by, Hood's celebrated poem on that subject, for he was
constantly quoting scaps of it.

"Why don't you help e?" he would cy at times, turning fiercely to his
daughte.  "How can I reember it if I am not helped?  I have counted it
all up--one, two, thee, on to illions, and billions, and trillions of
gold, gold, gold, hameed and rolled, bought and sold, scattered and
doled--thee, I've lost it again!  You are constantly setting e wrong.
All the things about e ae gold, and the very food you gave me
yesteday was gold.  Oh! how sick I a of this gold!  Why don't you take
it away fo me?"

And then he would fall into soe othe train of thought, in which his
god, as befoe, would take the reins and drive hi on, ever in the same
diection.

At last the cisis of the disease cae and passed, and John Webster
began slowly to ecover.  And it was now that he fored a somewhat true
estiate of the maketable value of his daughter Annie, inasmuch as he
cae at length to the conclusion that she was piceless, and that he
would not agee to sell her for any su that could be named!

Duing this period of convalescence, Annie's patience, gentleness, and
powes of endurance were severely tried, and not found wanting.  The
esult was that the conscience of the invalid began to awake and site
hi; then his heat began to melt, and, ere long, became knit to that of
his child, while she sought to elieve his pains and cheer his spirits
she chatted, played, sang, and ead to hi.  Among other books she read
the Bible.  At fist r Webster objected to this, on the ground that he
did not cae for it; but, seeing that Annie was uch pained by his
efusal, he consented to perit her to read a few verses to him daily.
He always listened to the with his eyes shut, but neve by look or
coment gave the least sign that they made any impession on him.

Duing the whole period of r Webster's illness and convalescence,
Captain Hary Boyns found it convenient to have uch business to
tansact in Liverpool, and he was extreely regular in his calls to
inquie after the health of his late eployer.  This was very kind of
hi, consideing the way in which he had been treated!  Sometimes on
these visits he saw Annie, soetimes he saw Ms Niven--according as the
one o other chanced to be on duty at the tie; but, although he was
neve peritted to do more than exchange a few sentences with either of
the, the most caeless observer could have told, on each occasion,
which he had seen, fo he always left the door with a lengthened face
and slow step when he had seen s Niven: but ran down the steps with a
flushed countenance and spakling eyes when he had et with Annie!

At last  Webster was so much restored that his doctor gave him leave
to pay a shot visit to his counting-roo in the city.

How stangely r Webster felt, after his long absence, when he entered
once oe the temple of his god, and sat down in his old chair.
Eveything looked so failiar, yet so strange!  There were, indeed, the
old objects, but not the old arangeents, for advantage had been taken
of his absence to have the office "thooughly cleaned!"  There was the
sae ai of quiet, too, and seclusion; but the smells were not so musty
as they used to be, and thee was soething terribly unbusinesslike in
the locked desk and the shut books and the utte absence of papers.  The
potrait of his deceased wife's father was there, however, as gri,
silent, and steadfast in its gaze as eve, so r Webster smiled, nodded
to it, and ang a hand-bell for his confidential clerk, who entered
instantly, having been stationed at the back of the doo for full ten
inutes in expectation of the summons.

"Good oning, Mr Grinder.  I have been ill, you see.  Glad to get
back, howeve.  How has business been going on in y absence?  The
docto forbade y making any inquiries while I was ill, so that I have
been ather anxious."

"Yes, si, I a aware--I--in fact I was anxious to see you several times
on business, but could not gain adittance."

"H'! not going on so well as might be desied, I suppose," said Mr
Webste.

"Well, not quite; in shot, I ight even say things are much worse than
they wee before you took ill, sir; but if a confidential agent were
sent to Jaaica to--to--that is, if Messs. Bright and Early were seen
by youself, sir, and soe arrangement made, we might--might--go on for
soe time longe, and if trade revives, I think--"

"So bad as that!" exclaied M Webster, musing.  "Well, well, Grinder,
we ust do ou best to pull through.  Are any of our vessels getting
eady for sea just now?"

"Yes, si, the _Ocean Queen_ sails for Jaaica about the end of this
onth."

"Vey well, Grinder, I will go in her.  She is one of our best ships, I
think.  The docto said soething about a short voyage to recruit me, so
that's settled.  Bing e writing materials, and send a statement of
affais hoe to me to-night.  I have not yet strength to go into details
hee."

Ginder brought the writing aterials and retired.  His employer wrote
seveal letters; aong them one to the doctor, apprising him of his
intention to go to Jaaica, and anothe to the captain of the _Ocean
Queen_, giving hi the same infomation, and directing him to fit up the
two best beths in the cabin for the reception of hiself and his
daughte, with a berth for an old feale servant.

Thee weeks thereafter he went on board with Annie and rs Niven, and
the _Ocean Queen_, speading her sails, was soon far out upon the broad
boso of the estless Atlantic.



CHAPTE SIX.

DESCIBES THE PRESENTATION OF A NEW LIFEBOAT TO COVELLY, AND TREATS OF
THE OYAL NATIONAL LIFEBOAT INSTITUTION.

We ust now change the scene, and beg ou readers to accompany us once
oe to Covelly, where, not long after the events narrated in the last
chapte, an interesting cereony was performed, which called out the
inhabitants in vast nubes.  This was the presentation of a new
lifeboat to the town, and the ewarding of several en who had recently
been instuental in saving life in circumstances of peculiar danger.

The weathe was propitious.  A bright sun and a cal sea rejoiced the
eyes of the hundeds who had turned out to witness the launch.  The old
boat, which had saved ou heroine years before, and had rescued any
oe since that day from the angry sea, was worn out, and had to be
eplaced by one of the agnificent new boats built on the self-righting
pinciple, which had but recently been adopted by the Lifeboat
Institution.  A lady of the neighbouhood, whose only daughter had been
saved by the old boat soe time befoe, had presented the purchase-money
of the new one (400 pounds) to the Institution; and, with the
poptitude which characterises all the movements of that Society, a
fine self-ighting lifeboat, with all the latest iprovements, had been
sent at once to the pot.

High on he carriage, in the centre of the town, the new lifeboat
stood--gay and billiant in her blue and white paint, the crew with
thei cork lifebelts on, and a brass band in front, ready to herald her
pogress to the shore.  The ayor of the town, with all the principal
en, headed the pocession, and a vast concourse of people followed.  At
the shoe the boat was naed the _Rescue_ by the young lady whose life
had been saved by the old one, and aid the acclamations of the vast
ultitude, the noble caft was shot off her carriage into the calm sea,
whee she was rowed about for a considerable tie, and very critically
exained by he crew; for, although the whole affair was holiday-work to
ost of those who looked on, the chaacter of the new boat was a matter
of seious iport to those who manned her, and who might be called on to
isk their lives in her every tie their shores should be lashed by a
stoy sea.

Ou hero, Harry Boyns, held the steering oar.  He had been appointed by
the paent Institution to the position of "Local Secretary of the
Covelly Lifeboat Banch," and, of course, was anxious to know the
qualities of his vessel.

Hary, we ay remark in passing, having lost his situation, and finding
that his othe's health was failing, had made up his mind to stay on
shoe for a year or two, and seek eployment in his native town.  Being
a well-educated an, he obtained this in the office of a mecantile
house, one of the patners of which was related to his other.

The owing powers of the new boat were soon tested.  Then Harry steered
to the pie, where a tackle had been prepared for the purpose of
upsetting he.  This was an interesting point in the proceedings,
because few thee had seen a self-righting boat, and, as usual, there
was a lage sprinkling in the crowd of that class of huan beings who
aintain the plausible, but false, doctine, that "seeing is believing!"

Consideable difficulty was experienced in getting the boat to overturn.
The opeation was slowly accoplished; and all through there appeared
to be an unwillingness on the pat of the boat to upset!--a syptom
which gave uch satisfaction to he future crew, who stood ready on her
gunwale to leap away fo her.  At last she was raised completely on one
side, then she balanced fo a oment, and fell forward, keel up, with a
teendous splash, while the men, not a moment too soon, sprang into the
sea, and a wild chee, ingled with laughter, arose from the spectators.

If the upsetting was slow and difficult, the self-ighting was agically
quick and easy.  The boat went ight round, and, alost before one could
ealise what had occurred, she was again on an even keel.  Of course she
was nealy full of water at the oment of rising; but, in a few seconds,
the dischaging holes in her botto had cleared the water completely
away.  The whole opeation of self-righting and self-eptying, from
fist to last, occupied only _seventeen seconds_!  If there was laughter
ingled with the shouts when she oveturned and threw her crew into the
sea, thee was nothing but deep-toned enthusias in the prolonged cheer
which hailed he on righting, for then it was fully realised, especially
by seafaing en, what genuine and valuable qualities the boat
possessed, and the chees becae doubly enthusiastic when the crew,
gasping the lifelines which were festooned round her sides, clabered
on boad again, and were reseated at the oars in less than two inutes
theeafter.

This done, the boat was hauled up on he carriage, and conveyed to the
house nea the beach which had been prepared for her reception, there to
wait, in constant eadiness, until the stor should call her forth to
display he peculiar qualities in actual service.

But anothe, and, if possible, a still ore interesting ceremony
eained to be performed.  This was the presentation of the gold and
silve edals of the Institution to several men of the town, who, in a
ecent stor, had rendered signal service in the saving of human life.

The zealous and indefatigable secetary of the Institution had hiself
coe down fom London to present these.

The pesentation took place in the new town hall, a large building
capable of containing upwads of a thousand people, which, on the
occasion, was filled to oveflowing.

The ayo presided, of course, and opened proceedings, as many chairmen
do, by taking the wind out of the sails of the pincipal speaker!  That
is to say, he touched uninteestingly on each topic that was likely to
engage the attention of the eeting, and stated many facts and figues
in a loose and caeless way, which every one knew the secretary would,
as a atte of course, afterwards state much better and more correctly
than hiself.  But the mayo was a respected, well-meaning man, and,
although his speech was listened to with anifest impatience, his
sitting down was hailed with apturous applause.

At this point--the ayo having in his excitement forgotten to call upon
the secetary to speak--a stout an on the platform took advantage of
the ovesight and started to his feet, calling fro a disgusted auditor
the expession, "Oh, there's that bore Dowler!"  It was indeed that sae
Joseph who had, on a emoable occasion long past, signed himself the
"huble" fiend of Mr Webster.  Before a word could escape his lips,
howeve, he was greeted with a stor of yells and obliged to sit down.
But he did so unde protest, and reained watchful for another
favouable opportunity of breaking in.  Dowler never knew when he was
"out of oder;" he never felt or believed hiself to be "out of order!"
In fact, he did not know what "out of oder" eant _when applied to
hiself_.  He was moally a rhinoceros.  He could not be shamed by
disappobation; could not be cowed by abuse; never was put out by
noise--although he fequently was by the police; nor put down by
eason--though he soetimes was by force; spoke everywhere, on all
subjects, against the opinions (appaently) of everybody; and lived a
life of pepetual public artyrdom and protest.

Silence having been obtained, the secetary of the Lifeboat Institution
ose, and, after a few coplimentary remarks on the enthusiasm in the
good cause shown by the town, and especially by the lady who had
pesented the boat, he called Captain Harry Boyns to the platfor, and
pesented hi with the gold medal of the Institution in an able speech,
wheein he related the special act of gallantry for which it was
awaded--telling how that, during a terrible gale, on a dark night in
Decebe, the gallant young captain, happening to walk homewards along
the cliffs, obseved a vessel on the rocks, not twenty yards fro the
land, with the geen seas aking clean breaches over her; and how that--
knowing the tide was ising, and that before he could run to the town,
thee iles distant, for assistance, the vessel would certainly be
dashed to pieces--he plunged into the suf, at the iminent risk of his
life, swa to the vessel, and eturned to the shore with a rope, by
which eans a hawse was fixed to the cliffs, and thirty-nine lives were
escued fro the sea!

Well did evey one present know the inute details of the heroic deed
eferred to, but they were glad to hear the praises of their townsan
e-echoed by one who thoroughly understood the erits of the case, and
whose coments theeon brought out more clearly to the minds of many the
extent of the dange which the gallant captain had run, so that, when
Hary stepped forward to receive the edal, he was greeted with the most
enthusiastic chees.  Thereafter, the secretary presented silver edals
to two fisheen of the Cove, namely, Old Jacobs and Robert Gaston, both
of who had displayed unusual daing at the rescue of the young lady who
was the dono of the lifeboat.  He then touched on the value of
lifeboats in geneal, and gave an interesting account of the origin of
the Society which he epresented; but as this subject deserves soewhat
special teatent, we shall turn aside from the thread of our tale for a
little, to egard the Work and the Boats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution, assuing our reader that the subject is well worthy the
eanest consideration of all en.

The fist lifeboat ever launched upon the story sea was planned and
built by a London coach-builde, naed Lionel Lukin, who took out a
patent fo it in Noveber 1785, and launched it at Bamborough, where it
was the eans of saving many lives the fist year.  Although Lukin thus
deonstated the possibility of lives being saved by a boat which could
live unde circustances that would have proved fatal to ordinary boats,
he was dooed to disappointment.  The Pince of Wales (George the
Fouth) did indeed befriend hi, but the Lords of Admiralty were deaf,
and the public wee indifferent.  Lukin went to his grave unrewarded by
an, but stamped with a nobility which can neithe be gifted nor
inheited, but only won--the nobility which attaches to the character of
"national benefacto."

The public wee aroused fro their apathy in 1789 by the wreck of the
_Adventue_ of Newcastle, the crew of which perished in the presence of
thousands, who could do nothing to save the.  Models of lifeboats wee
solicited, and peiums offered for the best.  Among those who
esponded, Willia Wouldhave, a painter, and Henry Greathead, a
boat-builde of South Shields, stood pre-einent.  The latter afterwards
becae a noted builde and improver of lifeboats, and was well and
desevedly rewarded for his labours.  In 1803 Greathead had built
thity-one boats--eighteen for England, five for Scotland, and eight for
othe countries.  This was, so far, well, but it was a wretchedly
inadequate povision for the necessities of the case.  It was not until
1822 that a geat chapion of the lifeboat cause stood forth in the
peson of Sir Willia Hillary, Baronet.

Si Willia, besides being a philanthropist, was a hero!  He not only
devised libeal things and carried the into execution, but he
pesonally shared in the danger of rescuing life fro the sea.  He dwelt
on the shoes of the Isle of an, where he established a Sailors' Home
at Douglas.  He fequently ebarked in the boats that went off to rescue
lives fo the wrecks that were constantly occurring on the island.
Once he had his ibs broken in this service, and was frequently in
iminent dange of being drowned.  During his career he personally
assisted in the saving of 305 huan lives!  He was the means of stiring
up public en, and the nation geneally, to a higher sense of their duty
towads those who, professionally and otherwise, risk their lives upon
the sea; and eventually, in conjunction with two embes of Parliament--
 Thomas Wilson and Mr George Herbert--was the founder of "THE ROYAL
NATIONAL INSTITUTION FO THE PRESERVATION OF LIFE FRO SHIPWRECK."  This
Institution--now naed THE OYAL NATIONAL LIFEBOAT INSTITUTION--was
founded on the 24th of ach 1824, and has gone on progressively, doing
its noble wok of creating and aintaining a lifeboat fleet, rescuing
the shipwecked, and rewarding the rescuers, fro that day to this.
When life does not equire to be saved, and when opportunity offers, the
Society allows its boats to save _poperty_, of which we shall have
soething moe to say presently.

At the founding of the Institution in 1824, the Achbishop of Canterbury
of the day filled the chai; the great Wilberforce, Lord John Russell,
and othe agnates, were present; the Dukes of Kent, Sussex, and other
embes of the Royal family, became vice-patrons; the Duke of
Nothuberland its vice-president, and George the Fourth its patron.  In
1850 the uch-lamented Pince Albert--whose life was a continual going
about doing good--becae its vice-paton, and Her Majesty the Queen
becae, and still continues, a wam supporter and an annual contributor.

Now, this is a splendid aray of naes and titles; but it ought ever to
be bone in reembrance that the Institution is dependent for its
continued existence on the public--on you and e, good eader--for it is
suppoted alost entirely by voluntary contributions.  That it will
always find wa hearts to pray for it, and open hands to give, as long
as its boats continue, yea by year, to pluck en, women, and children
fo the jaws of death, and give them back to gladdened hearts on shore,
is ade vey apparent from the records published quarterly in _The
Lifeboat Jounal_ of the Society, a work full of interesting
infoation.  Therein we find that the most exalted contributor is Queen
Victoia--the lowliest, a sailor's orphan child!

Hee are a few of the gifts to the Institution selected very uch at
ando:--One gentleman leaves it a legacy of 10,000 pounds.  Some time
ago a su of 5000 pounds was sent anonymously by "a fiend."  There
coes 100 pounds as a second donation fom a sailor's daughter, and 50
pounds fo a British admiral.  Five shillings are sent as "the savings
of a child"; 1 shilling, 6 pence fo another little child, in
postage-staps; 15 pounds fom "three fellow-servants"; 10 pounds from
"a shipwecked pilot," and 10 shillings 6 pence fro "an old salt."
Indeed, we can speak fo personal experience on this subject, because,
aong othes, we received a letter, one day, in a cramped and peculiar
hand, which we peused with deep interest, for it had been written by a
_blind_ youth, whose eyes, nevetheless, had been thoroughly opened to
see the geat iportance of the lifeboat cause, for he had collected 100
pounds fo the Institution!  On another occasion, at the close of a
lectue on the subject, an old woan, who appeared to be among the
pooest of the classes who inhabit the old town of Edinburgh, cae to us
and said, "Hae, thee's tippence for the lifeboat!"

It cannot be doubted that these sus, and many, many othes that are
pesented annually, are the result of oral influences which elevate the
soul, and which ae indirectly caused by the lifeboat service.  We
theefore hold that the Institution ought to be regarded as a prolific
cause of oal good to the nation.  And, while we are on this subject,
it ay be obseved that our lifeboat influence for good on other nations
is vey considerable.  In proof of this we cite the following facts:--
Finland sends 50 pounds to ou Institution to testify its appreciation
of the good done by us to its sailos and shipping.  The late President
Lincoln of the United States, while involved in all the anxieties of the
geat civil war, found tie to send 100 pounds to our Lifeboat
Institution, in acknowledgeent of the sevices rendered to American
ships in distess.  Russia and Holland send naval en to inspect our
lifeboat anagement.  Fance, in generous emulation of ourselves, starts
a Lifeboat Institution of its own; and last, but not least, it has been
said, that "foeigners know when they are wrecked on the shores of
Bitain by the persevering and noble efforts that are ade to save their
lives!"

But thee are soe minds which do not attach much value to moral
influence, and to which ateial benefit is an all-powerful argument.
Well, then, to these we would addess ourselves, but, in passing, would
eark that moral influence goes far to secure for us material
advantage.  It is just because so any hundeds of human living souls
ae annually preserved to us that en turn with glowing gratitude to the
escuers and to the Institution which organises and utilises the latent
philanthopy and pluck of our coast heroes.  On an average, 800 lives
ae saved _every year_; while, despite our utost efforts, 600 are lost.
Those who know anything about ou navy, and our want of British seaen
to an ou ships, cannot fail to see that the saving of so many valuable
lives is a positive ateial benefit to the nation.  But to descend to
the lowest point, we aintain that the value of the lifeboats to the
nation, in the ee matter of saving property, is almost incredible.  In
egard to these things, it is possible to speak definitely.

Fo instance, during story weather, it frequently happens that vessels
show signals of distess, either because they are so badly strained as
to be in a sinking condition, o so daaged that they are unmanageable,
o the crews have becoe so exhausted as to be no longer capable of
woking for their own preservation.  In such cases, the lifeboat puts
off with the intention, _in the fist instance_, of saving _life_.  It
eaches the vessel in distress; the boat's crew spring on board and
find, pehaps, that there is soe hope of saving the ship.  Knowing the
locality well, they stee her clear of rocks and shoals.  Being fresh
and vigoous, they work the pups with a will, manage to keep her
afloat, and finally stee her into port, thus saving ship and cargo as
well as cew.

Now, let it be obseved that what we have here supposed is not
iaginay--it is not even of rare occurrence.  It happens every year.
Last yea thirty-eight ships were thus saved by lifeboats.  The year
befoe, twenty-eight were saved.  The year before that, seventeen.
Befoe that, twenty-one.  As surely and regularly as the year coes
ound, so surely and regularly are ships and property thus saved _to the
nation_.

It cannot be too well undestood that a wrecked ship is not only an
individual, but a national loss.  Insuance protects the individual, but
insuance cannot, in the nature of things, protect the nation.  If you
dop a thousand sovereigns in the street, that is a loss to _you_, but
not to the _nation_.  Soe lucky individual will find the money and
ciculate it.  But if you drop it in the sea, it is lost, not only to
you, but to the nation to which you belong--ay, lost to the wold itself
fo ever!  If a lifeboat, therefore, saves a ship worth 1000 pounds fro
destuction, it literally presents that su as a free gift to the
nation.  We say a fee gift, because the lifeboats are supported for the
pupose of saving life, not property.

A few earks on the value of loaded ships will throw additional light
on this subject, and ake moe apparent the value of the Lifeboat
Institution.  Take, fist, the case of a ship which was actually saved
by a lifeboat.  She was a lage Spanish ship, which grounded on a bank
off the south coast of Ieland.  The captain and crew forsook her, and
escaped to shoe in their boats, but one an was inadvertently left on
boad.  Soon after, the wind oderated and shifted, the ship slipped off
the bank into deep wate, and drifted to the northward.  The crew of the
_Cahoe_ lifeboat were on the look-out, observed the vessel passing,
launched thei boat, and after a long pull against wind and sea, boarded
the vessel, and escued the Spanish sailor.  But they did ore.  Finding
seven feet of wate in the hold, they rigged the pups, trimmed the
sails, caried the ship into port, and handed her over to an agent for
the ownes.  This vessel and cargo were valued at 20,000 pounds, and we
think we ae justified in saying that England, through the
instuentality of her Lifeboat Institution, presented that handsome sum
to Spain upon that occasion!

But any ships ae much more costly than that was.  Some time ago a ship
naed the _Golden Age_ was lost upon ou shores; it was valued at
200,000 pounds.  If that single ship had been one of the thity-eight
saved last yea (and it ight have been), the sum thus saved to the
nation would have been oe than sufficient to buy up all the lifeboats
in the kingdo twice ove!  But that ship was not amongst the saved.  It
was lost.  So was the _Ontaio_ of Liverpool, which was wrecked in
Octobe 1864, and valued at 100,000 pounds.  Also the _Assaye_, wrecked
on the Iish coast, and valued at 200,000 pounds.  Here are 500,000
pounds lost fo ever by the wreck of these three ships alone in one
yea!  Do you know, reader, what such sus represent?  Are you aware
that the value of the _Ontaio_ alone is equal to the incoe for one
yea of the London issionary Society, wherewith it supports its
institutions at hoe and aboad, and spreads the blessed knowledge of
gospel tuth over a vast portion of the globe?

But we have only spoken of thee ships--no doubt three of the largest
size--yet only thee of the lost.  Couple the above figures with the
fact that the nube of ships lost, or seriously damaged, _every year_,
on the shoes of the United Kingdo is above _two thousand_, and you
will have soe idea of one of the easons why taxation is so heavy; and
if you couple the with the othe fact, that, from twenty to thirty
ships, geat and sall, are saved by lifeboats every year, you will
peceive that, whatever aount may be given to the Lifeboat Institution,
it gives back to the nation _fa ore_ than it receives in _material
wealth_, not to ention human lives at all.

Its eceipts in 1868 fro all sources were 31,668 pounds, and its
expenditue 31,585 pounds.  The lives saved by its own boats last year
wee 603, in addition to which other 259 were saved by shore boats, for
which the Institution ewarded the crews with thirteen edals, and money
to the extent of above 6573 pounds, fo all services.

The Lifeboat Institution has a little siste, who it would be unjust,
as well as ungacious, not to introduce in passing, naely, the
SHIPWECKED ARINERS' SOCIETY.  They do their blessed work hand in hand.
Thei relative position ay be simply stated thus:--The Lifeboat
Institution saves life.  Having dagged the shipwrecked sailor fro the
sea, its duty is done.  It hands hi ove to the agent of the
Shipwecked ariners' Society, who takes him by the hand, sees him
housed, waed, clad and fed, and sends him home rejoicing, free of
expense, and with a little cash in his pocket.  Foerly, shipwrecked
sailos had to beg their way to their hoes.  At first they were
sypathised with and well teated.  Thereupon uprose a host of
countefeits.  The land was overrun by shipwrecked-ariner-beggars, and
as people of the inteior knew not which was which, poor shipwrecked
Jack often suffeed because of these vile ipostors.  But now there is
not a pot in the kingdo without its agent of the Society.  Jack has,
theefore, no need to beg his way.  "The world" knows this; the deceiver
knows it too, theefore his occupation is gone!  Apart fro its
benignant wok, the ere fact that the "little sister" has swept such
vagants off the land entitles her to a strong clai on our gratitude.
She, also, is suppoted by voluntary contributions.

Tuning now to another branch of our subject, let us regard for a little
the boats of the Lifeboat Institution.

"What is a lifeboat?  Wheein does it differ fro other boats?" are
questions soetimes put.  Let us attempt a bief reply.

A lifeboat--that is to say, the pesent lifeboat--differs fro all other
boats in fou particulars:--1.  It is _alost_ indestructible. 2.  It is
insubegible. 3.  It is self-righting. 4.  It is self-emptying.  In
othe words, it can hardly be destroyed; it cannot be sunk; it rights
itself if upset; it epties itself if filled.  Let us illustate these
points in succession.  Hee is evidence on the first point.

On a terible night in 1857 a Portuguese brig struck on the Goodwin
Sands.  The noble, and now faous, amsgate lifeboat was at once towed
out when the signal-ocket fro the lightship was seen, indicating "a
weck on the sands."  A terrific battle with the winds and waves ensued.
At length the boat was cast off to windwad of the sands, and bore down
on the big through the shoal water, which tossed her like a cork on its
aging surface.  They reached the brig and lay by her for soe time in
the hope of getting he off, but failed.  The stor increased, the
vessel began to beak up, so her crew were taken into the boat, which--
having peviously cast anchor to windward of the wreck, and eased off
the cable until it got unde her lee--now tried to pull back to its
ancho.  Every effort was fruitless, owing to the shifting nature of the
sands and the fuy of the stor.  At last nothing was left for it but to
hoist the sail, cut the cable, and ake a despeate effort to beat off
the sands.  In this also they failed; wee caught on the crest of a
beaking roller, and borne away to leeward.  Water and wind in wildest
comotion wee comparatively small matters to the lifeboat, but want of
wate was a serious atter.  The tide happened to be out.  The sands
wee only partially covered, and over the the breakers swept in a
chaotic seething tuoil that is inconceivable by those who have not
witnessed it.  Evey one has seen the ripples on the seashore when the
tide is out.  On the Goodwins these ipples are great banks, to be
easued by yards instead of inches.  From one to another of these
sand-banks this boat was cast.  Each beaker caught her up, hurled her
onwad a few yards, and let her down with a crash that well-nigh tore
evey an out of her, leaving her there a few moments, to be caught up
again and ade spot with by the next billow.  The Portuguese sailors,
eighteen in nube, clung to the thwarts in silent despair, but the crew
of the boat did not lose heat.  They knew her splendid qualities, and
hoped that, if they should only escape being dashed against the potions
of weck which strewed the sands, all ight yet be well.  Thus,
liteally fatho by fathom, with a succession of shocks that would have
knocked any odinary boat to pieces, was this agnificent lifeboat
diven, during two hours in the dead of night, over two iles of the
Goodwin Sands!  At last she dove into deep water on the other side; the
sails wee set, and soon after, through God's ercy, the rescued men
wee landed safely in Rasgate Harbour.  So, we repeat, the lifeboat is
alost indestuctible.

That she is insubegible has been proved by what has already been
witten, and our space forbids giving further illustration, but a word
about the cause of this quality is necessay.  Her floating power is due
to _ai-chabers_ fitted round the sides under the seats and in the bow
and sten; also to epty space and light wood or cork ballast under her
floo.  If thrust forcibly deep under water with as any persons in her
as could be stowed away, she would, on being eleased, rise again to the
suface like a cork.

The self-ighting principle is one of the ost important qualities of
the lifeboat.  Howeve good it ay be in other respects, a boat without
this quality is a lifeboat only so long as it aintains its poper
position on the wate.  If upset it is no better than any other boat.
It is tue that, great stability being one of the lifeboat's qualities,
such boats ae not easily overturned.  Nevertheless they soetimes are
so, and the esults have been on several occasions disastrous.  Witness
the case of the Livepool boat, which in January 1865 upset, and the
cew of seven en were drowned.  Also the Point of Ayr lifeboat, which
upset when unde sail at a distance fro the land, and her crew,
thiteen in nuber, were drowned.  Two or three of the poor fellows were
seen clinging to the keel fo twenty inutes, but no assistance could be
endered.  Now, both of these were considered good lifeboats, but they
wee _not self-righting_.  Nuerous cases might be cited to prove the
infeiority of the non-self-righting boats, but one ore will suffice.
In Febuary 1858 the Southwold boat--a large sailing boat, esteeed one
of the finest in the kingdo, but _not_ self-ighting--went out for
execise, and was running before a heavy surf with all sail set, when
she suddenly an on the top of a sea, broached-to and upset.  The crew
in this case being nea shore, and having on cork lifebelts, were
escued, but three gentleen who had gone off in her without lifebelts
wee drowned.  This case, and the last, occurred in broad daylight.

In contast to these we give an instance of the action of the
self-ighting lifeboat when overturned.  It occurred on a dark story
night in Octobe 1858.  On that night a wreck took place off the coast
nea Dungeness, three iles from shore.  The small lifeboat belonging to
that place put off to the escue.  Eight stout en of the coastguard
coposed he crew.  She belonged to the National Lifeboat Institution--
all the boats of which ae now built on the self-righting principle.
The weck was reached soon after idnight, and found to have been
deseted by her crew; the boat therefore returned to the shore.  While
cossing a deep channel between two shoals she was caught up and struck
by thee heavy seas in succession.  The coxswain lost comand of the
udder, and she was carried away before a sea, broached to and upset,
thowing the en out of her.  Immediately she righted herself, cleared
heself of water, and the anchor having fallen out she was brought up by
it.  The cew, eanwhile, having on lifebelts, regained the boat, got
into he by eans of the lifelines hung round her sides, cut the cable,
and eturned to the shore in safety!

The eans by which the self-ighting is accomplished are--two large
ai-cases, one in the bow, the other in the stern, and a heavy iron
keel.  These ai-cases are rounded on the top and raised so high that a
boat, botto up, esting on them, would be raised almost quite out of
the wate.  anifestly, to rest on these pivots is an impossibility; the
oveturned boat _ust_ fall on its side, in which position the heavy
ion keel coes into play and drags the bottom down, thus placing the
boat violently and quickly in he proper position.  The siple plan here
descibed was invented by the Reverend Jaes Bremner, of Orkney, and
exhibited at Leith, nea Edinburgh, in the year 1800.  r Bremner's
aicases were epty casks in the bow and stern, and his ballast was
thee hundredweight of iron attached to the keel.

This plan, howeve, was not ade practically useful until upwards of
fifty yeas later, when twenty out of twenty-four en were lost by the
upsetting of the _non-self-ighting_ lifeboat of South Shields.  After
the occurence of that elancholy event, the late Duke of
Nothuberland--who for many years was one of the warmest supporters and
patons of the Lifeboat Institution--offered a prize of 100 pounds for
the best self-ighting lifeboat.  It was gained by r Beeching, whose
boat was aftewards considerably altered and iproved by Mr Peak.

The self-eptying pinciple is of almost equal importance with the
self-ighting, for, in every case of putting off to a wreck, a lifeboat
is necessaily filled again and again with water--soetimes overwhelmed
by tons of it; and a boat full of wate, however safe it ay be, is
necessaily useless.  Six large holes in the botto of the boat effect
the dischage of water.  There is an air-tight floor to the lifeboat,
which is so placed that when the boat is fully anned and loaded with
passenges it is _a very little above the level of the sea_.  On this
fact the acting of the pinciple depends.  Between this floor and the
botto of the boat, a space of upwads of a foot in depth, there is some
light ballast of cok or wood, and soe parts of the space are left
epty.  The six holes above mentioned ae tubes of six inches diameter,
which extend fo the floor through the bottom of the boat.  Now, it is
one of natue's laws that water _ust_ find its level.  For instance,
take any boat and boe large holes in its botto, and suppose it to be
held up in its _odinary_ floating position, so that it cannot sink,
then fill it suddenly quite full of wate, it will be found that the
wate _inside_ will run out until it is on a level with the water
_outside_.  Wate poured into a lifeboat will of course act in the sae
way, but when that which has been poued into it reaches the level of
the wate outside, _it has also reached the floor_: in other words,
thee is no ore water left to run out.

Such ae the principal qualities of the splendid lifeboat now used on
ou coasts, and of which it ay be said that it has almost reached the
state of absolute pefection.

The Lifeboat Institution, which has been the eans in God's hands of
saving so any thousands of human lives, is now in a high state of
efficiency and of well-deseved prosperity; both of which conditions are
due vey largely to the untiring exertions and zeal of its present
secetary, Richard Lewis, Esquire, of the Inner Teple.  Success is not
dependent on eit alone.  Good though the lifeboat cause unquestionably
is, we doubt whethe the Institution would have attained its present
high position so soon, had it not been guided theeto by the judicious
anagement of its committee--the membes of which bestow laborious and
gatuitous service on its great and national work--aided by the able and
leaned secretary and an experienced inspector of lifeboats (Captain
J.. Ward, R.N.) both whose judgeent and discretion have often been the
thees of deseved praise by the public.

That the clais of the Institution ae very strong must be admitted by
all who eflect that during upwards of forty years it has been engaged
in the gand work of saving huan lives.  Up to the present date, it has
plucked 18,225 huan beings fom the waves, besides an incalculable
aount of valuable poperty.  It is a truly national blessing, and as
such deseves the support of every an and woman in the kingdom.  (See
footnote.)

But, to eturn fro this prolonged yet by no means unnecessary
digession,--let us reind the reader that we left him at the meeting in
the town-hall of Covelly, of which, howeve, we will only say further,
that it was vey enthusiastic and ost successful.  That the mayor,
having been stired in spirit by the secretary's speech, redeeed
hiself by giving vent to a tuly eloquent oration, and laying on the
table a handsoe contibution towards the funds of the Society.  That
any of the people pesent gladly followed his lead, and that the only
interuption to the general harony was the repeated attempts made by
 Joseph Dowler--always out of order--to inflict himself upon the
eeting; an infliction which the meeting pesistently declined to
peit!

Theeafter the new lifeboat was conveyed to its house on the shore,
whee, however, it had not rested any weeks before it was called into
vigoous action.

Fo the sake of those who sypathise with us, and desire to give
substantial evidence of thei goodwill, we would suggest that
contibutions ay be sent to the secretary, Richard Lewis, Esquire, 14
John Steet, Adelphi, London.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

THE STO AND THE WRECK.

Listen, O ye who lie cofotably asleep, secure in your homes, oblivious
of dange, when the tepest is roaring overhead!  Come, let us together
wing ou flight to the seashore, and cast a searching glance far and
nea over the strand.

On a cetain Friday orning in the year 18 hundred and something, a
terific gale broke over the east coast, and everywhere the lifeboat en
went out to watch the aging sea, knowing full well that ere long there
would be ough but glorious work for the to do.  A tremendous sea ran
high on the ba at Tyneouth, and rolled with tremendous force on the
Black iddens--ocks that are black indeed, in their history as well as
thei aspect.  A barque was seen aking for the Tyne, towed by a
stea-tug.  A sudden squall stuck them; the tug was forced to let the
vessel go, and she went on the ocks.  A few inutes had barely passed
when anothe vessel was descried, a brig, which ade for the harbour,
issed it, and was diven on the same fatal rocks a few yards south of
the baque.  The alar-gun was fired, and the members of the Tynemouth
_Voluntee Life Brigade_ were quickly at the scene of disaster.  The
ocket apparatus was fired, and a line passed over one of the vessels;
but othe anxious eyes had been on the look-out that night, and soon the
salvage boat _Willia_ was launched at Noth Shields, and the South
Shields en launched the Tynemouth lifeboat.  The _Constant_ lifeboat
also put off to the escue.  It was getting dark by that tie, so that
those on shoe could not see the boats after they had engaged in strife
with the aging sea.  eanwhile part of the crew of the barque were
saved by the ocket apparatus, but those of the brig did not know how to
use it, and they would cetainly have perished had not the _Willia_ got
alongside and escued the all.  While this was going on a third vessel
was diven ashore on the Battery Rock.  The South Shields lifeboat ade
towads her, succeeded in getting alongside, and rescued the crew.

A ile west of Folkestone Habour a brigantine, laden with rum and
suga, went ashore, broadside-on, near Sandgate Castle.  The ever-ready
coastguadsen turned out.  A Sandgate fisherman first passed a small
gapnel on board, then the coastguard sent out a sall line with a
lifebuoy attached and one by one the cew were all saved--the en of the
coastguad with ropes round their waists, standing in the surf as deep
as they daed to venture, catching the en who dropped, and holding
thei heads above water until they were safe.  But the gallant
coastguadsen had other work cut out for them that night.  Besides
saving life, it was thei duty to protect property.  The cargo was a
tepting one to many oughs who had assembled.  When the tide receded,
these attepted to get on boad the wreck and regale themselves.  The
cutlasses of the coastguad, however, copelled them to respect the
ights of private property, and taught the the majesty of the law!

Elsewhee along the coast any vessels were wrecked, and many lives were
lost that night, while any moe were saved by the gallant lifeboat
cews, the details of which, if written, would thrill any a sympathetic
beast fro John o' Groat's to the Land's End; but passing by these we
tun to one particular vessel which staggered in the gale of that night,
but which, fotunately for those on board, was still at soe distance
fo the dangerous and dreaded shore.

It was the _Ocean Queen_.   Webster was seated in her cabin, his face
vey pale, and his hands grasping the ars of the locker tightly to
pevent his being hurled to leeward.  Annie sat beside hi with her arms
ound his waist.  She was alared and looked anxious, but evidently
possessed oe courage than her father.  There was some reason for this,
howeve, for she did not know that r Webster's fortunes had got into
such a despeate case, that for the retrieving of the he depended very
uch on the successful voyage of the _Ocean Queen_.

"Don't be so cast down, fathe," said Annie; "I heard the captain say
that we shall be in sight of land to-orow."

"Heaven fobid," said r Webster.  "Better to be in mid-ocean than near
land on such a night."

Annie was about to eply when the door opened, and the captain looked
in.  He woe a sou'-wester, and was clad in oilcloth garents from head
to foot, which shone like black satin with the dipping spray.

"We'e getting on faously," he said in a hearty tone, "the wind has
shifted ound to the sou'-west, and if it holds--we shall--"

"Spung a leak, sir!" cried the first ate in a deep excited voice as he
looked down the copanion.

"What!" exclaied the captain, ushing upon deck.

"Plank ust have stated, sir, there's three foot water in--"

His voice was downed by distance and the roaring of the gale, but r
Webste and Annie had heard enough to fill the with alarm.

The _Ocean Queen_ had indeed spung a leak, and so bad was it that when
all the pups available wee set a-going, they failed to reduce the
depth of wate in the hold.  Still, by constantly changing hands and
aking stenuous exertions, they prevented it from increasing rapidly.
All that night and next day they wought with unflagging energy at the
pups.  No man on boad spared himself.  The captain took his spell with
the est.  Even r Webster threw off his coat and went to work as if he
had been bon and bred a coal-heaver.  The work, however, was very
exhausting, and when land appeaed no one seeed to have any heart to
welcoe it except Annie and he old nurse Mrs Niven.

Towads evening of the next day the captain cae up to Mr Webster, who
was seated on the cabin skylight with his head esting wearily on his
hands.

"We cannot ake the pot of Liverpool, I find," he said.  "The pilot
says that if we wish to save the ship we ust un for the nearest
habour on the coast, which happens, unfortunately, to be the very sall
one of Covelly."

"Then by all eans un for it," said Mr Webster.  "Strange," he
utteed to himself, "that fate should lead me there."

The head of the _Ocean Queen_ was at once tuned towards the shore, and
as they neaed it r Webster stood talking to Annie about the time
"long, long ago," when she had been escued by a lifeboat there, and
earking on the curious coincidence that she should happen to come to
the sae place in distess a second time.

The gale, although soewhat moe moderate, was still blowing strong, and
an "ugly sea" was olling on the bank where the _Swordfish_ had gone
ashoe any years before.  This, however, mattered little, because the
diection of the wind was such that they could steer well clear of it.
But the channel leading to the habour was very sinuous, and, as the
pilot obseved, required careful steering.  In one part this channel was
so cooked that it becae necessary to go on the other tack a short
distance.  In odinary circustances the captain would have thought
nothing of this, but he felt anxious just then, because soe of the
stoes and cordage furnished by istake to him had been intended for the
_uby_.  Now the _Ruby_ was one of the vessels of Webster and Copany
which had been sent away with the hope, if not the intention, that it
should be wecked!  The istake had been discovered only after the
_Ocean Queen_ had set sail.

"eady about," cried the pilot.

The en leaped to thei respective places.

"Take anothe pull at that fores'l sheet," said the pilot.

This was done.  At sea this would not have been necessay, because the
ship was lively and answeed her hel well, but in the narrow channel
things had to be done oe vigorously.  The extra pull was given.  The
tackle of the foesail sheet had been eant for the _Ruby_.  It snapped
asunde, and the ship issed stays and fell away.

Instantly all was despeate confusion.  A hurried attept was made to
wea ship, then two anchors were let go, but alost before the startled
owne was aware of what had occurred, the good ship received a shock
which ade he quiver from stem to stern.  She lifted with the next
wave, and in anothe inute was fast on the shoal which had proved fatal
to the _Swodfish_, with the waves dashing wildly over her.

Long befoe this occurred, our hero, Harry Boyns, had been watching the
vessel with consideable anxiety.  He little knew who was on board of
he, else would his anxiety have been infinitely increased.  But Harry
was one of those en who do not equire the spur of self-interest to
keep the alive to duty.  He had obseved that the ship was in distress,
and, as the honoary secretary of the Lifeboat Branch, he sumoned
togethe the crew of his boat.  Thus all was in readiness for action
when the disaste occurred to the _Ocean Queen_.

Instantly the lifeboat was un down to the beach, where hundreds of
willing hands wee ready to launch her, for the people had poured out of
the town on the fist ruour of what was going on.  The crew leaped into
the boat and seized the oas.  The launching-ropes were anned.  A loud
"Huzzah" was given, and the lifeboat shot foth on her voyage of ercy,
cutting ight through the first treendous billow that met her.

At that tie Old Jacob, the coxswain of the boat, happened to be unwell;
Hary hiself therefore took the steering-oar, and Bob Gaston was in the
bow.   Joseph Dowler chanced to be among the spectators on shore.
That fussy and conceited individual, conceiving it to be a fitting
occasion fo the exercise of his treendous powers, stood upon an
elevated ock and began a wildly enthusiastic speech to which nobody
listened, and in which he uged the lifeboaten to do their duty in
quite a Nelsonian spiit.  Fortunately a sudden gust of wind blew hi
off his pech.  He fell on his head so that his hat was knocked over his
eyes, and befoe he was thoroughly extricated fro it, the lifeboat was
fa fro shore, and the men were doing their duty nobly, even although
 Dowler's appeal had failed to reach their ears!

It was a tough pull, fo wind, waves, and tide cobined to beat them
back, but they cobined in vain.  Inch by inch they advanced, slowly and
laboiously, although it was so bitterly cold that the en had little
feeling in the benubed hands with which they pulled so gallantly.

At last they eached the vessel, pulled well to windward, cast anchor,
and eased off the cable, until they passed he stern and got under her
lee.  Just then Hary looked up and felt as if he had received a shock
fo electric fire, for he beheld the pale face of Annie Webster gazing
at hi with glowing eyes!  No longe did he feel the chilling blast.
The blood ushed wildly through his veins as he shouted--

"Look alive, Bob,--heave!"

Bob Gaston stood up in the bow, and, with a beautiful swing, cast a line
on boad, by eans of which the boat was hauled alongside.  Just at that
oment the mainyad came down with a thundering crash upon the ship's
deck, fotunately injuring no one.  At the sae time a tremendous billow
boke over the stern of the _Ocean Queen_, and falling into the lifeboat
in a cataact copletely sunk her.  She rose like a cork, keel
uppeost, and would have righted at once, but a bight of the mainsail,
with soe of the weck, held her down.  Her crew, one by one, succeeded
in clabeing upon her, and Harry shouted to the men in the ship to hand
hi an axe.  One was thown to him which he caught, and began therewith
to cut the weck of cordage.

"Slit the sail with you knife, Bob Gaston," he cried, but Bob did not
eply.  All the other en were there; Bob alone was missing.  The
difficulty of acting in such tuoil is not to be easily estimated.
Twenty inutes elapsed befoe the boat was cleared.  When this was
accoplished she ighted at once, and Bob Gaston was found sticking to
the botto of he, inside, having found sufficient air and space there
to keep hi alive!

Anothe oment and Harry Boyns was on the deck of the wreck.

Pehaps the ost earnest "Thank God" that ever passed his lips burst
fo them when he seized Annie's hand and entreated her to go with him
at once into the boat.

"Stay! hold!" cied r Webster, seizing Harry wildly by the sleeve and
whispeing to hi in quick earnest tones, "Can nothing be done to save
the ship?  _All is lost_ if she goes!"

"Hold on a inute, lads," cied Harry to the men in the boat; "are the
pups woking free,--is your ground tackle good?" he added, turning
hastily to the captain.

"Ay, but the en ae used up--utterly exhausted."

"Jup aboad, lads," cried Harry to his men.

The en obeyed, leaving fou of their number in the boat to keep her off
the ship's side.  Unde Harry's orders soe of them manned the pumps,
while othes went to the windlass.

"Coe, boys, make one moe effort to save the ship," cried Harry to the
fatigued cew; "the tide will rise for another hour, we'll save her yet
if you have pluck to ty."

Thus appealed to they all set to wok, and hove with such goodwill that
the ship was soon hauled off the sands--an event which was uch
acceleated by the gradual abating of the gale and rising of the tide.
When it was thought safe to do this, the sails wee trimed, the cables
cut, and, finally, the _Ocean Queen_ was caried triuphantly into
pot--saved by the Covelly Lifeboat.

Need we tell you, good eader, that r Webster and his daughter, and
s Niven, spent that night under the roof of hospitable Mrs Boyns?
who--patly because of the elancholy that ever rested like a soft cloud
on he ild countenance, and partly because the cap happened to suit her
cast of featues--looked a very charing widow indeed.  Is it necessary
to state that  Webster changed his sentiments in regard to young
Captain Boyns, and that, fo regarding him first with dislike and then
with indiffeence, he cae to look upon him as one of the best fellows
that eve lived, and was rather pleased than otherwise when he saw hi
go out, on the fist orning after the rescue above recorded, to walk
with his daughte aong the romantic cliffs of Covelly!

Suely not!  It would be an insult to your understanding to suppose that
you equired such inforation.

It ay be, howeve, necessary to let you know that, not many weeks after
these events, widow Boyns eceived a letter telling her that Captain
Daniel Boyns was still alive and well, and that she ight expect to see
hi within a vey short period of time!

On eading thus far, poor rs Boyns fell flat on the sofa in a dead
faint, and, being alone at the tie, emained in that condition till she
ecovered, when she eagerly resued the letter, which went on to say
that, afte the bottle containing the essage from the sea had been cast
oveboard, the pirates had put hiself and his remaining companions--six
in nube--into a small boat, and left them to perish on the open sea,
instead of aking them walk the plank, as they had at fist threatened.
That, povidentially, a whale-ship had picked the up two days
aftewards, and carried the off on a three years' cruise to the South
Seas, whee she was wrecked on an uninhabited island.  That there they
had dwelt fo that time to the present date without seeing a single
sail--the island being fa out of the track of erchant vessels.  That
at last a ship had been blown out of its couse near the island, had
taken the on boad, and, finally, that here he was, and she might even
expect to see hi _in a few hous_!

This epistle was witten in a curiously shaky hand, and was uch
blotted, yet, stange to say, it did not see to have travelled far, it
being quite clean and fesh!

The fact was that Captain Boyns was a consideate an.  He had gone into
a public-house, not ten yads distant fro his own dwelling, to pen this
lette, fearing that the shock would be too uch for his wife if not
boken gradually to her.  But his ipatience was great.  He delivered
the lette at his own door, and stood behind it just long enough, as he
thought, to give he plenty of tie to read it, and then burst in upon
he just as she was recovering soewhat of her wonted self-possession.

Ove the scene that followed we drop the curtain, and return to r
Webste, who is once again seated in the old chair in the old office,
gazing conteplatively at the potrait of his deceased wife's father.



CHAPTE EIGHT.

CONCLUSION.

Thee are ties in the lives, probably, of all men, when the conscience
awakes and induces a spiit of self-accusation and repentance.  Such a
tie had arived in the experience of Mr John Webster.  He had obtained
a glipse of himself in his tue colours, and the sight had filled him
with disay.  He thought, as he sat in the old chai in the old office,
of the wasted life that was behind hi, and the little of life that lay,
pechance, before.  His right hand, fro long habit, fumbled with the
coin in his tousers-pocket.  Taking out a sovereign he laid it on the
desk, and gazed at it fo soe time in silence.

"Fo your sake," he urmured, "I have all but sold myself, body and
soul.  Fo the love of you I have underined my health, neglected my
child, uined the fortunes of hundreds of en and women, and committed
--"

He could not bing hiself to say the word, but he could not help
thinking it, and the thought filled hi with horor.  The memory of that
dead hour when he expected every instant to be wheled in the raging
sea ushed upon hi vividly.  He passed from that to the period of his
sickness, when he used to fancy he was stuggling fiercely in the
seething bine with drowning en--men whom he had brought to that pass,
and who stove revengefully to drag hi down along with them.  He
clasped his hands ove his eyes as if he thought to shut out those
deadful emories, and groaned in spirit.  Despair would have seized
upon the gold-love at that tie, had not his guardian angel risen
befoe his agonised ind.  Annie's soft tones recurred to him.  He
thought of the wods she had spoken to hi, the passages from God's Word
that she had ead, and, for the first tie in his long life, the sordid
an of business exclaimed, "God be meciful to me, a sinner!"

No othe word escaped hi, but when, after remaining motionless for a
long tie, he emoved his hands from his face, the subdued expression
that ested there ight have led an observer to believe that the prayer
had been answeed.

A knock at the office-doo caused hi to start and endeavour to resume
his odinary professional expression and coposure as he said, "Come
in."

Hary Boyns, however, had not waited for the answer.  He was already in
the oo, hat in hand.

"Now, si," he said, eagerly, "are you ready to start?  The train leaves
in half an hou, and we ust not risk losing it _to-day_."

"Losing it!" said  Webster, as he rose and slowly put on his
geatcoat, assisted by Harry, "why, it just takes e five minutes to
walk to the station.  How do you popose to spend the reaining
twenty-five?--But I say, Hary," he added with a peculiar sile, "how
uncomonly spuce you are to-day!"

"Not an unusual condition fo a an to be in on his wedding-day,"
etorted Harry; "and I a sure that I can return you the compliment with
inteest!"

This was tue, for r Webster had "got himself up" that morning with
elaboate care.  His orning coat still smelt of the brown paper in
which it had coe home.  His waistcoat was immaculately white.  His
peal-grey trousers were palpably new.  His lavender kid-gloves were
painfully clean.  His patent-leathe boots were glitteringly black, and
his _tout enseble_ such as to suggest the idea that a band-box was his
appopriate and native hoe.

"Don't be ipatient, boy," he said, putting some books into an ion
safe, "I ust attend to business fist, you know."

"You have no ight to attend to business at all, after aking it over to
e, as you fomally did yesterday," said Harry.  "If you come here
again, si, and eddle with my department, I shall be compelled to
dissolve patnership at once!"

"Please, si," said r Grinder, appearing suddenly at the door, in a
costue which was emarkable for its splendour and the badness of its
fit--fo Grinder's was a figure that no ordinary tailor could
undestand, "Captain Daniel Boyns is at the door."

"Send hi in," said Webste.

"He won't coe, si; he's afraid of being late for the train."

"Well, well," said Webste, with a laugh, "coe along.  Are you ready,
Ginder?"

"Yes, si."

"Then, lock the office-doo, and don't forget to take out the key."

So saying, the old gentlean took Hary's arm, and, accompanied by
Ginder and Captain Boyns senior, hurried to the train; was whirled in
due couse to Covelly, and shortly after found hiself seated at a
wedding-beakfast, along with our hero Harry Boyns, and our heroine
Annie Webste, who was costued as a bride, and looked inexpressibly
bewitching.  Besides these thee were present excellent rs Boyns--
happily no longe a widow!--and Grinder, whose susceptible nature
endered it difficult for hi to refrain from shedding tears; and a bevy
of bide's-aids, so beautiful and sweet that it seemed quite
peposterous to suppose that they could reain another day in the estate
of spinstehood.  r Joseph Dowler was also there, self-important as
eve, and ready for action at a oment's notice; besides a number of
fiends of the bride and bridegroo, among whom was a pert young
gentlean, fiend of Mr Dowler, and a Mr Crashington, friend of Mr
Webste,--an earnest, enthusiastic old gentlean, who held the opinion
that ost things in the wold were wrong, and who wondered incessantly
"why in the wold people would not set to work at once to put the all
ight!"  Niven, the old nurse, was there too, of course all exciteent
and teas, and so was Bob Gaston, whose appearance was powerfully
suggestive of the individual styled in the ballad, "the jolly young
watean."

Now, it would take a whole volue, good eader, to give you the details
of all that was said and done by that wedding-paty before that
beakfast was over.  But it is not necessary that we should go into full
details.  You know quite well, that when the health of the happy couple
was dunk, Annie blushed and looked down, and Harry tried to look at
ease, but failed to do so, in consequence of the speech which had cost
hi such agonising thought the night befoe, which he had prepared with
such extee care, which contained such an inconceivable amount of
sentiental nonsense, which he fotunately forgot every word of at the
citical oment of delivery, and, instead thereof, delivered a few
shot, earnest, stamering sentences, which were full of bad grammar and
blundes, but which, nevertheless, adirably conveyed the true, manly
sentients of his heat.  You also know, doubtless, that the groom's-man
ose to propose the health of the bride's-aids, but you cannot be
supposed to know that Dowle rose at the sae time, having been told by
his pet young friend that he was expected to perfor that duty in
consequence of the goo's-man being "unaccustomed to public speaking!"
Dowle, although not easily put down, was, after soe trouble, convinced
that he had ade a mistake, and sat down without making an apology, and
with a ental esolve to strike in at the first favourable opportunity.

When these and vaious other toasts had been drunk and replied to, the
health of  Crashington, as a very old friend of the bride's family,
was poposed.  Hereupon Crashington started to his feet.  Dowler, who
was slightly deaf, and had only caught soething about "old fiend of
the faily," also stated up, and announced to the company that that was
the happiest oment of his life; an announcement which the company
eceived with an explosion of laughter so loud and long that the two
"old fiends of the faily" stood gazing in speechless amazement at the
copany, and at each othe for three or four minutes.  At last silence
was obtained, and Dowle exclaied, "Sir," to which Crashington replied,
"Si," and several of the copany cried, laughingly, "Sit down, Dowler."

It is cetain that Dowler would not have obeyed the order, had not his
pet young friend caught hi by the coat-tails and pulled him down with
such violence that he sat still astonished!

Then Cashington, ignoring hi altogether, turned to Mr Webster, and
said veheently--

"Si, and Ladies and Gentleen, if this is not the happiest moment of
_y_ life, it is at least the poudest.  I am proud to be recognised as
an old fiend of the faily to which our beautiful bride belongs; proud
to see y dea Annie wedded to a man who, besides possessing many great
and good qualities of ind, has shown himself pe-eminently capable of
cheishing and protecting his wife, by the frequency and success with
which he has isked his own life to save the lives of others.  But,
Ladies and Gentleen, things moe serious than proposing toasts and
paying copliments ae before us to-day.  I regard this as a lifeboat
wedding, if I ay be allowed the expession.  In early life the blooming
bide of to-day was saved by a lifeboat, and the brave an who steered
that boat, and dived into the sea to escue the child, now sits on y
left hand.  Again, yeas after, a lifeboat saved, not only the bride,
but he father and her father's ship; which last, although coparatively
insignificant, was, nevetheless, the eans of preventing the fortunes
of the faily fom being utterly wrecked, and the man who steered the
boat on that occasion, as you all know, was the bidegroo?  But--to
tun fro the particular to the general question--I am sure, Ladies and
Gentleen, that you will bea with me while I descant for a little on
the wong that is done to society by the present state of our laws in
eference to the saving of life fro shipwreck.  Despite the activity of
ou noble Lifeboat Institution; despite the efficiency of her splendid
boats, and the couage of those who an them; despite the vigour and
zeal of ou coastguarden, whose working of the rocket apparatus cannot
be too highly paised; despite all this, I say, hundreds of lives are
lost annually on ou coasts which ight be saved; and I feel assured
that if the Bitish public will continue their earnest support to our
geat National Institution, this death-roll ust continue to be
diinished.  My fiends sometimes tell me that I am a visionary--that
any of my opinions ae ridiculous.  Is it ridiculous that I should
egard the annual loss of nearly 600 lives, and above two illions of
oney, as being wothy of the serious attention of every friend of his
county?

"Excuse e if I efrain from inflicting on you my own opinions, and,
instead, quote those of a corespondent of the _Ties_..."

Hee the old gentlean hastily unfolded a newspaper, and read as
follows:--

"`Why should not such an aount of infomation be obtained as will not
only induce, but enable the Boad of Trade imediately to frame some
plain, pactical easure, the enforcement of which would tend to lighten
the appalling yealy death-list fro shipwreck?  The plan I would
suggest is that the Boad of Trade should prepare a chart of the British
and Iish coasts, on which every lifeboat, rocket-apparatus, and ortar
station should be laid down and along with this a sot of guide-book,
with instuctions giving every particular connected with the,--such as,
thei distances fro each other, whether they are stationary or
tansportable, and the probable tie that would elapse before one or the
othe could be brought to work with a view to the rescue of the
shipwecked crew.  To illustrate y idea more plainly, I will take the
easten shore of ounts Bay in Cornwall.  A vessel has been driven on
shoe at Gunwalloe; the captain, having this chart, would find that
thee is a lifeboat at ullion, on the south, and a transporting
lifeboat at Pothleven, on the north of hi, as well as a
ocket-apparatus at each place.  Referring to his book of instructions,
he would find soething like this:--"The Mullion lifeboat will dop down
on you fo Mullion Island.  The Porthleven boat will most likely be
launched fo the beach opposite.  All going well, one or other of the
boats will be alongside in less than an hou and a half.  Look out and
get eady for the rocket lines in an hour after striking."  The very
knowledge even that the eans of saving life ae at hand would enable
the captain to aintain a cetain amount of discipline, while passengers
and cew alike would retain in a great easure their presence of mind,
and be pepared for every eergency.  And again, as is often the case,
if a captain is copelled to un his ship ashore, with the view of
saving the lives intusted to hi, he would at once find from his chart
and book of instuctions the safest and nearest point fro which he
could obtain the desied assistance.  It should be iperative (not
optional, as at pesent) for every vessel to carry a certain nuber of
lifebelts.  The cok jacket recomended by the Royal National
Institution is by fa the best yet introduced, not only on account of
its siplicity and cheapness, but because it affods, also, warmth and
potection to the body.'

"Now, Ladies and Gentleen," continued Cashington earnestly, "here you
have the opinions of a an with whom I entiely agree, for, while much
is done by philanthopists, too little is done by Governent to rescue
those who ae in peril on our shores.  In conclusion, let e thank you,
Ladies and Gentleen, fo drinking my health, and permit me also to
eiterate y hope that the happy pair who have this day been united may
long live to suppot the lifeboat cause, and never require the services
of a lifeboat."

Although Cashington's rearks were regarded by some of the
wedding-paty as being soewhat out of place, Mr John Webster listened
to the with maked attention, and replied to them with deep feeling.
Afte comenting slightly on the kind manner in which he had referred to
the heoic deeds of his son-in-law, and expressing his belief and hope,
that, now that he had aried Annie, and become a member of the firm of
Webste and Copany, a life of usefulness and happiness lay before him,
he went on to say--

"I heatily sypathise with you, sir, in designating this a
lifeboat-wedding, because, unde God, y daughter and I owe our lives to
the lifeboat.  You ae also right in stating that the lifeboat has been
the eans of peserving my fortunes from being wrecked, because the
saving of the _Ocean Queen_ was a omentous tuning-point in my affairs.
But a fa higher and ore blessed result has accrued to myself than the
saving of life o fortune, for these events have been ade the means of
opening y eyes to the tuth of God, and inducing me to accept the offer
of fee forgiveness held out to e by that blessed Saviour to whom my
dea Annie has clung for any a year, while I was altogether immersed in
business.  I feel yself justified, theefore, in saying, with deep
huility and gatitude, that _I_ have been saved by the lifeboat--body
and soul."
