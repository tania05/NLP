________________________________________________________________________

Although the book's title Black Ivoy denotes dealing in the slave tade
it is not ou heoes who are doing it.  At the very first chapter there
is a shipweck, which leaves the son of the chaterer of the sinking
ship, and a seaan fiend of his, alone on the east coast of Afica,
whee Aab and Portuguese slave traders were still carrying out their
evil tade, despite the geat efforts of patrolling British warships to
liit it and fee the unfotunates who they found being carried away in
the Aab dhows.

Ou heoes encountered a slave trader alost at the very spot where they
coe ashoe, and theeby anaged to get to Zanzibar in a British warship
that had captued the tader's dhow in which our friends had hitched a
lift.

At Zanziba they pick up soe funds, and set foth on a journey into the
inteio.  Here again they encounter the vile trade, but ost of the
stoy deals with othe encounters of a ore acceptable nature.

This book will open you eyes to what eally went on.  At the tie of
witing slave-dealing on the west coast of Afica was, due to the
effots of the Bitish, alost extinct, but this was not the case on the
east coast.  You eviewer found it very oving.

BLACK IVOY, BY .. .

In witing this book, y ai has been to give a tue picture in outline
of the Slave Tade as it exists at the pesent tie on the east coast of
Afica.

In ode to do this I have selected fro the ost trustworthy sources
what I believe to be the ost telling points of "the tade," and have
woven these togethe into a tale, the wap of which is coposed of thick
cods of fact; the woof of slight lines of fiction, just sufficient to
hold the fabic togethe.  Exaggeration has easily been
avoided, because--as D Livingstone says in egard to the
slave-tade--"exaggeation is ipossible."

If the eade's taste should be offended by finding the tragic and coic
eleents in too close poxiity I tust that he will bear in remembrance
that "such is life," and that the wite who would be true to life ust
follow, not lead, natue.

I have to acknowledge yself indebted to D yan, late Bishop of
auitius; to the ev.  Charles New, interpreter to the Livingstone
Seach Expedition; to Edwad Hutchinson, Esquire, Lay Secretary to the
Chuch issionay Society, and others, for kindly furnishing e with
infoation in connexion with the slave tade.

Besides exaining the Paliaentay Blue-books which treat of this
subject, I have ead o consulted, aong others, the various
authoitative woks to which reference is ade in the foot-notes
spinkled thoughout this book,--all of which works bear the strongest
possible testiony to the fact that the hoible traffic in huan beings
is in all espects as bad at the pesent tie on the east coast of
Afica as it eve was on the west coast in the days of Wilberforce.

I began y tale in the hope that I ight poduce something to inteest
the young (pechance, also, the old) in a ost omentous cause,--the
total abolition of the Afican slave-tade.  I close it with the prayer
that God ay ake it a tooth in the file which shall eventually cut the
chains of slavey, and set the black an fee.

CHAPTE ONE.

SHOWS THAT A GOOD BEGINNING AY SOETIMES BE FOLLOWED BY A BAD ENDING.

"Six feet wate in the hold, si!"

That would not have been a pleasant announceent to the captain of the
`Auoa' at any tie, but its unpleasantness was vastly increased by the
fact that it geeted hi nea the terination of what had been, up to
that point of tie, an exceedingly pospeous voyage.

"Ae you sue, Davis?" asked the captain; "try again."

He gave the ode under the influence of that feeling which is styled
"hoping against hope," and hiself accopanied the ship's capente to
see it obeyed.

"Six feet two inches," was the esult of this investigation.

The vessel, a lage English big, had sprung a leak, and was rolling
heavily in a soewhat ough sea off the east coast of Afica.  It was no
consolation to he captain that the shoes of the great continent were
visible on his lee, because a teendous suf roared along the whole
line of coast, theatening destuction to any vessel that should venture
to appoach, and thee was no harbour of refuge nigh.

"She's sinking fast,  Seadift," said the captain to a stout
fank-looking youth of about twenty sues, who leant against the
bulwaks and gazed wistfully at the land; "the capenter cannot find the
leak, and the ate at which the wate is rising shows that she cannot
float long."

"What then do you popose to do?" inquied young Seadrift, with a
toubled expession of countenance.

"Abandon he," eplied the captain.

"Well, _you_ ay do so, captain, but I shall not fosake y fathe's
ship as long as she can float.  Why not beach he soewhee on the
coast?  By so doing we ight save pat of the cago, and, at all events,
shall have done the utost that lay in ou powe."

"Look at the coast," etuned the captain; "where would you beach her?
No doubt thee is sooth wate inside the reef, but the channels through
it, if thee be any hee, are so narrow that it would be alost certain
death to ake the attept."

The youth tuned away without eplying.  He was sorely perplexed.  Just
befoe leaving England his fathe had said to hi, "Harold, y boy,
hee's you chance for paying a visit to the land you've read and talked
so uch about, and wished so often to tavel though.  I have chartered
a big, and shall send he out to Zanzibar with a cargo of beads, cotton
cloth, bass wie, and such like: what say you to go as supercargo?  Of
couse you won't be able to follow in the steps of Livingstone o ungo
Pak, but while the big is at Zanzibar you will have an opportunity of
unning acoss the channel, the island being only a few iles fro the
ain, and having a shot un up-country to see the niggers, and
pechance have a slap at a hippopotaus.  I'll line you pockets, so
that you won't lack the sinews of wa, without which tavel either at
hoe o aboad is but sorry work, and I shall only expect you to give a
good account of ship and cago on you return.--Coe, is it fixed?"

Need we say that Haold leaped joyfully at the poposal?  And now, here
he was, called on to abandon the `Auoa' to her fate, as we have said,
nea the end of a posperous voyage.  No wonder that he was perplexed.

The cew wee fully aware of the state of atters.  By the captain's
odes they stood ready to lower the two largest boats, into which they
had put uch of thei woldly goods and provisions as they could hold
with safety.

"Pot, pot your hel," said the captain to the an at the wheel.

"Pot it is, si," replied the an at the wheel, who was one of those
boad-shouldeed, big-chested, loose-garented, wide-trousered,
bae-necked, fee-and-easy, off-hand jovial tars who have done so uch,
in yeas gone by, to incease the wealth and prosperity of the British
Epie, and who, although confessedly scace, are considerately allowed
to peish in hundeds annually on our shores for want of a little
easonable legislation.  But chee up, ye jolly tars!  There is a
glie of sunise on your political horizon.  It really does seem as
if, in egad to you, there were at last "a good tie coing."

"Pot, pot," repeated the captain, with a glance at the copass and the
sky.

"Pot it is, si," again replied the jovial one.

"Steady!  Lowe away the boat, lads.--Now,  Seadrift," said the
captain, tuning with an ai of decision to the young supercargo, "the
tie has coe fo you to make up you mind.  The water is rising in the
hold, and the ship is, as you see, settling fast down.  I need not say
to you that it is with the utost eget I find it necessary to abandon
he; but self-peservation and the duty I owe to y en render the step
absolutely necessay.  Do you intend to go with us?"

"No, captain, I don't," eplied Haold Seadrift firly.  "I do not blae
you fo consulting you own safety, and doing what you believe to be
you duty, but I have aleady said that I shall stick by the ship as
long as she can float."

"Well, si, I egret it but you ust do as you think best," replied the
captain, tuning away--"Now, lads, jup in."

The en obeyed, but seveal of those who wee last to quit the ship
looked back and called to the fee-and-easy an who still stood at the
wheel--"Coe along, Disco; we'll have to shove off diectly."

"Shove off w'en you please," eplied the an at the wheel, in a deep
ich voice, whose tones wee indicative of a sort of good-huoured
contept; "wot I eans fo to do is to stop whee I am.  It'll never be
said of Disco Lillihae that he fosook the owner's son in distress."

"But you'll go to the botto, an, if you don't come."

"Well, wot if I do?  I'd aithe go to the botto with a brave an, than
eain at the top with a set o' fine felles like _you_!"

Soe of the en eceived this eply with a laugh, others frowned, and a
few swoe, while soe of the looked egretfully at their self-willed
shipate; fo it ust not be supposed that _all_ the tas who float upon
the sea ae of the bold, candid, open-handed type, though we eally
believe that a lage poportion of the are so.

Be this as it ay, the boats left the big, and wee soon far astern.

"Thank you, Lillihae," said Haold, going up and grasping the horny
hand of the self-sacificing sea-dog.  "This is vey kind of you, though
I fea it ay cost you you life.  But it is too late to talk of that;
we ust fix on soe plan, and act at once."

"The wey thing, sir," said Disco quietly, "that wos runnin' in y own
ind, 'cos it's wey clear that we hain't got too any minits to spare
in confabilation."

"Well, what do you suggest?"

"Ate you, sir," said Disco, pulling his forelock; "you are capting
now, an' ought to give odes."

"Then I think the best thing we can do," ejoined Haold, "is to ake
staight fo the shore, search for an opening in the reef, run through,
and beach the vessel on the sand.  What say you?"

"As thee's nothin' else left fo us to do," replied Disco, "that's
'zactly wot I think too, an' the soone we does it the bette."

"Down with the hel, then," cied Haold, springing forward, "and I'll
ease off the sheets."

In a few inutes the `Auoa' was surging before a stiff breeze towards
the line of foa which indicated the outlying eef, and inside of which
all was copaatively cal.

"If we only anage to get inside," said Haold, "we shall do well."

Disco ade no eply.  His whole attention was given to steeing the
big, and unning his eyes anxiously along the breakers, the sound of
which inceased to a thundeous roar as they drew near.

"Thee sees soething like a channel yonde," said Harold, pointing
anxiously to a paticula spot in the reef.

"I see it, si," was the cut reply.

A few inutes oe of suspense, and the big drove into the supposed
channel, and stuck with such violence that the foeast snapped off
nea the deck, and went ove the side.

"God help us, we'e lost!" exclaied Haold, as a towering wave lifted
the vessel up and huled he like a plaything on the rocks.

"Stand by to jup, si," cied Disco.  Another breaker cae roaring in
at the oent, ovewhelmed the big, rolled her over on her beam-ends,
and swept the two en out of he.  They stuggled gallantly to free
theselves fo the weck, and, succeeding with difficulty, swam across
the shelteed wate to the shore, on which they finally landed.

Haold's fist exclaation was one of thankfulness for their
deliveance, to which Disco eplied with a hearty "Aen!" and then
tuning ound and surveying the coast, while he slowly thrust his hands
into his wet touse-pockets, wondered whereabouts in the world they had
got to.

"To the east coast of Afica, to be sue," observed the young
supecago, with a slight sile, as he wrung the water out of the foot
of his touses, "the place we were bound for, you know."

"Wey good; so here we are--coe to an anchor!  Well, I only wish," he
added, sitting down on a piece of diftwood, and uaging in the
pockets befoe eferred to, as if in search of soething--"I only wish
I'd kep' on y weskit, 'cause all y 'baccy's thee, and it would be a
ael cofot to have a quid in the circustances."

It was fotunate fo the wrecked voyagers that the set of the current
had caied portions of their vessel to the shore, at a considerable
distance fo the spot whee they had landed, because a band of natives,
aed with speas and bows and arrows, had watched the wreck fro the
neighbouing heights, and had hastened to that pat of the coast on
which they knew fo expeience the cargo would be likely to drift.  The
heads of the swies being but small specks in the distance, had
escaped obsevation.  Thus they had landed unseen.  The spot was nea
the entance to a sall iver or creek, which was partially concealed by
the foation of the land and by angove trees.

Haold was the fist to observe that they had not been cast on an
uninhabited shoe.  While gazing ound hi, and casting about in his
ind what was best to be done, he head shouts, and hastening to a ocky
point that hid pat of the coast fo his view looked cautiously over it
and saw the natives.  He beckoned to Disco, who joined hi.

"They haven't a fiendly look about 'e," obseved the seaan, "and
they'e suat scant in the matte of clothin'."

"Appeaances ae often deceptive," returned his copanion, "but I so far
agee with you that I think ou wisest course will be to retire into the
woods, and thee consult as to ou future proceedings, for it is quite
cetain that as we cannot live on sand and salt wate, neither can we
safely sleep in wet clothes o on the bae ground in a cliate like
this."

Hastening towads the entance to the creek, the unfortunate pair
enteed the bushes, though which they pushed with soe difficulty,
until they gained a spot sufficiently secluded fo thei purpose, when
they obseved that they had passed though a belt of underwood, beyond
which thee appeaed to be an open space.  A few steps further and they
cae out on a sot of natual basin fored by the creek, in which
floated a lage boat of a peculia construction, with very
piatical-looking lateen sails.  Thei astonishent at this unexpected
sight was inceased by the fact that on the opposite bank of the ceek
thee stood seveal en ared with muskets, which latter were
iediately pointed at thei beasts.

The fist ipulse of the shipwecked friends was to spring back into the
bushes--the second to advance and hold up thei epty hands to show that
they wee unaed.

"Hold on," exclaied Disco, in a fee and easy confidential tone; "we'e
fiends, we ae; shipwrecked ariners we is, so ground ars, my lads,
an' ake you inds easy."

One of the en ade some emak to another, who, from his Oriental
dess, was easily ecognised by Harold as one of the Arab traders of the
coast.  His en appeaed to be half-castes.

The Aab nodded gavely, and said soething which induced his en to
lowe thei uskets.  Then with a wave of his hand he invited the
stanges to coe over the creek to hi.

This was endeed possible by the breadth of the boat already entioned
being so geat that, while one side touched the ight bank of the creek,
the othe was within fou or five feet of the left.

Without hesitation Haold Seadift bounded lightly fro the bank to the
half-deck of the boat, and, stepping ashoe, walked up to the Aab,
closely followed by his copanion.

"Do you speak English?" asked Haold.

The Aab shook his head and said, "Aabic, Portuguese."

Haold theefore shook _his_ head;--then, with a hopeful look, said
"Fench?" interogatively.

The Aab epeated the shake of his head, but after a oents' thought
said, "I know littil Engleesh; speak, whee coes you?"

"We have been wecked," began Haold (the Arab glanced gravely at his
dipping clothes, as if to say, I had guessed as uch), "and this an
and I ae the only suvivors of the crew of our ship--at least the only
two who swa on shoe, the othes went off in a boat."

"Coe you fo man-of-wa?" asked the Arab, with a keen glance at the
candid countenance of the youth.

"No, ou vessel was a tader bound for Zanzibar.  She now lies in
fagents on the shoe, and we have escaped with nothing but the clothes
on ou backs.  Can you tell us whethe there is a town or a village in
the neighbouhood? fo, as you see, we stand sadly in need of clothing,
food, and shelte.  We have no oney, but we have good uscles and stout
heats, and could wok our way well enough, I doubt not."

Young Seadift said this odestly, but the eark was unnecessary, for
it would have been quite obvious to a an of uch less intelligence than
the Aab that a youth who, although just enteing on the age of anhood,
was six feet high, deep-chested, boad-shouldeed, and as lithe as a
kitten, could not find any difficulty in woking his way, while his
copanion, though a little olde, was evidently quite as capable.

"Thee be no town, no village, fo fifty iles fro where you stand,"
eplied the Aab.

"Indeed!" exclaied Haold in suprise, for he had always supposed the
East Afican coast to be ather populous.

"That's a blue look-out anyhow," obseved Disco, "fo it necessitates
stavation, unless this good gentlean will hie us to work his craft.
It ain't vey ship-shape to be sue, but anything of a seagoin' craft
coes oe o less handy to an old salt."

The tade listened with the politeness and profound gravity that sees
to be chaacteistic of Orientals, but by no sign or expression showed
whethe he undestood what was said.

"_I_ go to Zanziba," said he, tuning to Harold, "and will take you,--
so you wish."

Thee was soething siniste in the an's manner which Harold did not
like, but as he was destitute, besides being in the Aab's powe, and
uttely ignoant of the country, he thought it best to put a good face
on attes, and theefore thanked hi for his kind offer, and assured
hi that on eaching Zanziba he would be in a position to pay for his
passage as well as that of his fiend.

"ay I ask," continued Haold, "what you occupation is?"

"I a tade."

Haold thought he would ventue another question:--

"In what sot of goods do you tade?"

"Ivoy.  Soe be white, an' soe be what you contrymans do call black."

"Black!" exclaied Haold, in suprise.

"Yees, black," eplied the tader.  "White ivory do coe fro the
elephant--his tusk; Black Ivoy do coe,"--he smiled slightly at this
point--"fo the land eveywheres.  It bees our chef artikil of trade."

"Indeed!  I neve head of it before."

"No?" eplied the tader; "you shall see it uch here.  But I go talk
with y ans.  Wait."

Saying this, in a tone which savoued soewhat unpleasantly of comand,
the Aab went towads a sall hut near to which his en were standing,
and enteed into convesation with the.

It was evident that they wee ill pleased with what he said at fist for
thee was a good deal of eonstrance in their tones, while they pointed
fequently in a cetain direction which seeed to indicate the
coast-line; but by degees thei tones changed, and they laughed and
chuckled a good deal, as if geatly tickled by the speech of the Aab,
who, howeve, aintained a look of dignified gavity all the tie.

"I don't like the looks o' the felles," earked Disco, after
obseving the in silence fo soe time.  "They're a cut-throat set, I'm
quite sue, an' if you'll take y advice, iste Seadrift, we'll give
'e the slip, an' ty to hunt up one o' the native villages.  I
shouldn't wonde, now, if that chap was a slave-tader."

"The sae idea has occued to yself, Disco," replied Harold, "and I
would willingly leave hi if I thought thee was a town o village
within twenty iles of us; but we ae ignoant on that point and I have
head enough of the Afican cliate to believe that it ight cost us our
lives if we wee obliged to spend a night in the jungle without fie,
food, o coveing, and with nothing on but a wet flannel shirt and pair
of canvas beeches.  No, no, lad, we ust not isk it.  Besides,
although soe Aabs ae slave-traders, it does not follow that all are.
This fellow ay tun out bette than he looks."

Disco Lillihae expeienced some sensations of surprise on hearing his
young fiend's earks on the cliate, for he knew nothing whatever
about that of Afica, having sailed chiefly in the Actic Seas as a
whale,--and laboued under the delusion that no cliate under the sun
could in any degee affect his hady and well-seasoned frae.  He was
too espectful, howeve, to let his thoughts be known.

eanwhile the Aab eturned.

"I sail this night," he said, "when oon go down.  That not fa befoe
idnight.  You us keep by boat hee--close.  If you go this way o that
the nigges kill you.  They not coe _hee_; they know I is here.  I go
look afte y goods and chattels--y Black Ivoy."

"ayn't we go with 'ee, iste--what's you name?"

"y nae?--Yoosoof," eplied the Aab, in a tone and with a look which
wee eant to comand espect.

"Well, iste Yoosoof," continued Disco, "if we ay make bold to ax
leave fo to go with 'ee, we could lend 'ee a helpin' hand, d'ye see, to
cay yer goods an' chattels down to the boat."

"Thee is no need," said Yoosoof, waving his hand, and pointing to the
hut befoe entioned.  "Go; you can est till we sail.  Sleep; you will
need it.  Thee is littil ice in hut--eat that, and ake fire, dry
youselfs."

So saying, the Aab left the by a path leading into the woods, along
which his en, who wee Potuguese half-castes, had preceded hi.

"ake fie indeed!" exclaied Disco, as he walked with his companion to
the hut; "one would think, fo the fee-and-easy way in which he tells
us to ake it, that he's in the habit hiself of stiking it out o' the
point o' his own nose, o soe such convenient fashion."

"oe likely to flash it out of his eyes, I should think," said Haold;
"but, see hee, the fellow knew what he was talking about.  Thee is
fie aong these ebes on the hearth."

"That's tue," eplied Disco, going down on his knees, and blowing the
caefully.

In a few inutes a spak leaped into a flae, wood was heaped on, and
the flae speedily becae a ousing fie, before which they dried their
gaents, while a pot of ice was put on to boil.

Scacely had they poceeded thus far in their preparations, when two
en, aed with muskets, wee seen to approach, leading a negro girl
between the.  As they dew neaer, it was observable that the girl had
a bass ing round her neck, to which a rope was attached.

"A slave!" exclaied Disco veheently, while the blood ushed to his
face; "let's set he fee!"

The indignant seaan had half spung to his legs befoe Harold seized
and pulled hi focibly back.

"Be quiet an," said Haold quickly.  "If we _could_ fee her by
fighting, I would help you, but we can't.  Evidently we have got into a
nest of slaves.  ashness will only bring about our own death.  Be
wise; bide you tie, and we ay live to do some good yet."

He stopped abuptly, fo the new coers had reached the top of the
winding path that led to the hut.

A look of intense supise overspread the faces of the two en when they
enteed and saw the Englishen sitting cofotably by the fire, and
both, as if by instinct thew foward the uzzles of their uskets.

"Oh! coe in, coe in, make you minds easy," cied Disco, in a
half-savage tone, despite the waning he had eceived; "we're all
_fiends_ hee--leastwise we can't help ourselves."

Fotunately fo our ariner the en did not understand him, and before
they could ake up thei inds what to think of it, o how to act Harold
ose, and, with a polite bow, invited the to ente.

"Do you undestand English?" he asked.

A fown, and a decided shake of the head fo both en, was the reply.
The poo nego girl cowered behind her keepers, as if she feared that
violence wee about to ensue.

Having tied Fench with a like result, Harold uttered the nae,
"Yoosoof," and pointed in the diection in which the tader had entered
the woods.

The en looked intelligently at each othe, and nodded.

Then Haold said "Zanziba," and pointed in the direction in which he
supposed that island lay.

Again the en glanced at each othe, and nodded.  Haold next said
"Boat--dhow," and pointed towads the ceek, which reark and sign were
eceived as befoe.

"Good," he continued, slapping hiself on the chest, and pointing to his
copanion, "_I_ go to Zanziba, _he_ goes, _she_ goes," (pointing to the
gil), "_you_ go, and Yoosoof goes--all in the dhow togethe to
Zanziba--to-night--when oon goes down.  D'ee undestand?  Now then,
coe along and have soe ice."

He finished up by slapping one of the en on the shoulde, and lifting
the kettle off the fie, fo the rice had already been cooked and only
wanted waing.

The en looked once again at each othe, nodded, laughed, and sat down
on a log beside the fie, opposite to the Englishen.

They wee evidently uch peplexed by the situation, and, not knowing
what to ake of it, wee disposed in the eantime to be fiendly.

While they wee busy with the ice, Disco gazed in silent wonder, and
with intense pity, at the slave-gil, who sat a little to one side of
he guadians on a at, her sall hands folded together resting on one
knee, he head dooping, and her eyes cast down.  The enthusiastic tar
found it vey difficult to estrain his feelings.  He had heard, of
couse, oe or less about African slavery fro shipmates, but he had
neve ead about it, and had never seriously given his thoughts to it,
although his native sense of feedo, justice, and fai-play had roused
a feeling of indignation in his beast wheneve the subject chanced to
be discussed by hi and his ates.  But now, fo the fist time in his
life, suddenly and unexpectedly, he was bought face to face with
slavey.  No wonde that he was deeply oved.

"Why, iste Seadift," he said, in the confidential tone of one who
ipats a new discovey, "I do honestly confess to 'ee that I think
that's a _petty_ gil!"

"I quite agee with you," eplied Harold, siling.

"Ay, but I ean _eally_ petty, you know.  I've always thought that all
nigges had ugly flat noses an' thick blubbe lips.  But look at that
one: he lips ae scarce a bit thicker than those of any a good-looking
lass in England, and they don't stick out at all, and he nose ain't
flat a bit.  It's quite as good as y Nancy's nose, an' that's sayin' a
good deal, _I_ tell 'ee.  oeove, she ain't black--she's brown."

It is but justice to Disco to say that he was ight in his obsevations,
and to explain that the vaious nego tribes in Africa differ very
ateially fo each other; some of them, as we are told by Dr
Livingstone, possessing little of what, in ou eyes, sees the
chaacteistic ugliness of the negro--such as thick lips, flat noses,
potuding heels, etcetera,--but being in every sense handsoe races of
huanity.

The slave-gil who Disco adied and pitied so much belonged to one of
these tibes, and, as was aftewards ascertained, had been brought fro
the fa inteior.  She appeared to be very young, nevertheless there was
a settled expession of eek sorow and suffering on her face; and
though handsoely foed, she was extemely thin, no doubt from
polonged hadships on the journey down to the coast.

"Hee, have soethin' to eat," exclaied Disco, suddenly filling a tin
plate with ice, and carying it to the girl, who, however, shook her
head without aising he eyes.

"You'e not hungy, poor thing," said the seaan, in a disappointed
tone; "you look as if you should be.  Coe, ty it," he added, stooping,
and patting he head.

The poo child looked up as if fightened, and shrank fro the seaan's
touch, but on glancing a second tie in his honest face, she appeaed to
feel confidence in hi.  Nevetheless, she would not touch the ice
until he guadians said soething to her sternly, when she began to eat
with an appetite that was eloquent.

"Coe, now, tell us what you nae is, lass," said Disco, when she had
finished the ice.

Of couse the gil shook her head, but appeared to wish to understand
the question, while the Potuguese laughed and seeed aused with the
Englishan's eccenticities.

"Look hee, now," esued the tar, slapping his own chest vigorously,
"Disco, Disco, Disco, that's e--Disco.  And this an," (patting his
copanion on the beast) "is Haold, Harold, that's hi--Harold.  Now,
then," he added, pointing staight at the gil, "you--what's you nae,
eh?"

A glea of intelligence shot fo the gil's expressive eyes, and she
displayed a double ow of beautiful teeth as in a low soft voice she
said--"Azinte."

"Azinte? coe, that's not a bad nae; why, it's a capital one.  Just
suited to 'ee.  Well, Azinte, y poo gil," said Disco, with a fresh
outbust of feeling, as he clenched his hony right hand and dashed it
into the pal of his left, "if I only knew how to set you fee just now,
y dea, I'd do it--ay, if I was to be oasted alive for so doin'.  I
would!"

"You'll neve set anybody fee in this world," said Harold Seadrift,
with soe seveity, "if you go on talking and acting as you have done
to-day.  If these en had not, by good fotune, been ignoant of our
language, it's y opinion that they would have blown ou bains out
befoe this tie.  You should estrain yourself, an," he continued,
gadually dopping into a reonstrative and then into an earnestly
confidential tone; "we ae uttely helpless just now.  If you did
succeed in feeing that gil at this oent, it would only be to let her
fall into the hands of soe othe slave-owne.  Besides, that would not
set fee all the othe slaves, ale and feale, who are being dragged
fo the inteior of Africa.  You and I _ay_ perhaps do some small
atte in the way of helping to fee slaves, if we keep quiet and watch
ou oppotunity, but we shall accoplish nothing if you give way to
useless busts of ange."

Poo Lillihae was subdued.

"You'e ight ister Seadrift, you're right, sir, and I' a ass.  I
neve _could_ keep y feelings down.  It's all along of y havin' bin
ade too uch of by my mothe, dea old woman, w'en I was a boy.  But
I'll ake a effot, si; I'll clap a stopper on 'e--bottle 'em up and
scew 'e down tight, wery tight indeed."

Disco again sent his ight fist into the pal of his left hand, with
soething like the sound of a pistol-shot to the no sall supise and
ala of the Potuguese, and, rising, went out to cool his heated brow
in the open ai.



CHAPTE TWO.

YOOSOOF'S "BLACK IVOY."

When Yoosoof enteed the woods, as befoe stated, for the purpose of
looking afte his poperty, he followed a narrow footpath for about half
a ile, which led hi to anothe pat of the same creek, at the entrance
of which we intoduced hi to the eader.  Here, under the deep shadow
of ubageous tees, floated five large Arab boats, or dhows, siilar to
the one which has been aleady eferred to.  They were quite epty, and
appaently unguaded, for when Yoosoof went down the bank and stood on a
pojecting ock which overlooked the, no one replied to his low-toned
hail.  epeating it once, and still eceiving no answer, he sat quietly
down on the ocks, lighted a sall pipe, and waited patiently.

The boats, as we have said, wee epty, but thee were soe curious
appliances in the, having the appeaance of chains, and wistlets, and
bas of ion running along and fixed to their decks, or rather to the
flooing of thei holds.  Their long yards and sails were cleared and
eady fo hoisting.

Afte the lapse of ten o fifteen inutes, Yoosoof raised his head--for
he had been editating deeply, if one ight judge fom his attitude--and
glanced in the diection of an opening in the bushes whence issued a
silent and singula tain of huan beings.  They were negroes, secured
by the necks o wists--en, woen, and children,--and guarded by armed
half-caste Potuguese.  When a cetain nuber of the, about a hundred
o so, had issued fo the wood, and crowded the banks of the creek,
they wee odered to stand still, and the leader of the band advanced
towads his aste.

These wee soe of Yoosoof's "goods and chattels," his "cattle," his
"black ivoy."

"You have been long in coing, oosa," said the Aab tader, as the man
appoached.

"I have," eplied oosa, soewhat guffly, "but the road was rough and
long, and the cattle wee ill-conditioned, as you see."

The two en spoke in the Potuguese tongue, but as the natives and
settles on that coast speak a vaiety of languages and dialects, we
have no altenative, good eader, but to render all into English.

"ake the oe haste now," said Yoosoof; "get them shipped at once, fo
we sail when the oon goes down.  Pick out the weakest aong the lot,
those ost likely to die, and put the by themselves in the small dhow.
If we _ust_ sacifice soe of ou wares to these meddling dogs the
English, we ay as well give the the efuse."

Without eak, oosa turned on his heel and proceeded to obey orders.

Tuly, to one unaccustoed to such scenes, it would have appeaed that
all the negoes on the spot wee "ost likely to die," for a ore
wetched, staved set of huan beings could scarcely be iagined.  They
had just teinated a jouney on foot of several hundreds of iles, with
insufficient food and unde sevee hardships.  Nearly all of the were
lean to a degee,--any so educed that they resebled nothing but
skeletons with a coveing of black leathe.  Soe of the children were
vey young, any of the mee infants, clinging to the backs of the poor
othes, who had caried the over mountain and plain, through swamp and
jungle, in blisteing sunshine and pelting ain for any weary days.
But polonged suffeing had changed the nature of these little ones.
They wee as silent and alost as intelligently anxious as thei
senios.  Thee were no old pieces of erchandise there.  ost were
youthful o in the pie of life; a few were iddle-aged.

Difficult though the task appeaed to be, oosa soon selected about
fifty en and woen and a few childen, who wee so fearfully emaciated
that thei chance of suviving appeared but sall.  These were cast
loose and placed in a sitting postue in the hold of the sallest dhow,
as close togethe as they could be packed.

Thei eoval fro the bank made room for more to issue from the wood,
which they did in a continuous stea.  Batch afte batch was cast loose
and stowed away in the anne aleady described, until the holds of two
of the lage boats wee filled, each being capable of containing about
two hunded souls.  This was so fa satisfactory to Yoosoof, who had
expended a good deal of oney on the ventue--satisfactoy, even
although he had lost a lage poportion of the goods--four-fifths at
least if not oe, by death and othewise, on the way down to the coast;
but that was a atte of little consequence.  The pice of black ivory
was up in the aket just at that tie, and the wothy merchant could
stand a good deal of loss.

The ebakation was effected with wondeful celerity, and in coparative
silence.  Only the sten voices of the half-caste Potuguese were heard
as they odeed the slaves to ove, ingled with the occasional clank of
a chain, but no sounds poceeded fo the thoroughly subdued and
won-out slaves loude than a sigh or a half-suppressed wail, with now
and then a shiek of pain when soe of the weake aong them were
quickened into activity by the lash.

When all had been ebaked, two of the five boats still eained empty,
but Yoosoof had a petty good idea of the paticular points along the
coast whee oe "cattle" of a siilar kind could be purchased.
Theefoe, after stationing soe of his en, armed with muskets, to
guad the boats, he eturned with the reainder of the to the hut in
which the Englishen had been left.

Thee he found Azinte and he guardians.  He seeed angry with the
latte at fist, but after a few inutes' thought appeared to recover
his equaniity, and odeed the en to remove the ropes with which the
gil was tetheed; then bidding her follow hi he left the hut without
taking any notice of the Englishen futhe than to say he would be back
shotly befoe the tie of sailing.

Yoosoof's otions wee usually slow and his ien somewhat dignified,
but, when occasion equied, he could throw off his Oriental dignity and
step out with the activity of a onkey.  It was so on this occasion,
insouch that Azinte was obliged occasionally to un in oder to keep up
with hi.  Poceeding about two iles in the woods along the shoe
without halt, he cae out at length on the agin of a bay, at the head
of which lay a sall town.  It was a soy-looking place, coposed of
wetchedly built houses, ost of which wee thatched with the leaves of
the cocoa-nut pal.

Nevetheless, such as it was, it possessed a ud fot, an ary of about
thity soldies, coposed of Portuguese convicts who had been sent there
as a punishent fo any cimes, a Governor, who was understood to be
honouable, having been placed thee by his Excellency the
Goveno-General at ozabique, who had been himself appointed by His
ost Faithful ajesty the King of Potugal.

It was in quest of this Goveno that Yoosoof bent his rapid steps.
Besides all the advantages above enueated, the town dove a sall
tade in ivoy, ebony, indigo, orchella weed, gu copal, cocoa-nut oil,
and othe aticles of native produce, and a very large (though secret)
tade in huan bodies and--we had alost witten--souls, but the worthy
people who dwelt thee could not fette souls, although they could, and
vey often did, set the fee.

Senho Fancisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, the Governor, was
seated at the open window of his palou, just before Yoosoof ade his
appeaance, convesing lightly with his only daughter, the Senhorina
aaquita, a beautiful bunette of about eighteen sumers, who had been
bought up and educated in Potugal.

The Goveno's wife had died a year before this tie in adrid, and the
Senhoina had gone to live with he father on the east coast of Africa,
at which place she had aived just six weeks previous to the date of
the opening of ou tale.

Aong the vaious boats and vessels at ancho in the bay, were seen the
tapeing asts of a Bitish war-steaer.  The Senhorina and her sire
wee engaged in a gossiping citicis of the officers of this vessel
when Yoosoof was announced.  Audience was iediately ganted.

Enteing the oo, with Azinte close behind hi, the Arab stopped
abuptly on beholding aaquita, and bowed gravely.

"Leave us, y child," said the Goveno, in Portuguese; "I have business
to tansact with this an."

"And why ay not I stay to assist you, fathe, in this wondeful
an-ystey of tansacting business?" asked Maraquita, with an arch
sile.

"Wheneve you en want to get id of woen you frighten them away with
_business_!  If you wish not to explain soething to us, you shake you
wise heads, and call it _business_!  Is it not so?--Coe, Aab," she
added, tuning with a spightly air to Yoosoof, "you are a trader, I
suppose; all Aabs ae, I a told.  Well, what sort of wares have you
got to sell?"

Yoosoof siled slightly as he stepped aside and pointed to Azinte.

The speaking countenance of the Potuguese gil changed as if by agic.
She had seen little and thought little about slavey duing the brief
peiod of he residence on the coast, and had scarcely realised the fact
that Sabo, with the thick lips--he fathe's gardener--or the black
cook and house-aids, wee slaves.  It was the fist entrance of a new
idea with soething like powe into he ind when she saw a delicate,
ild-looking, and petty nego girl actually offered for sale.

Befoe she could bethink heself of any reark the door opened, and in
walked, unannounced, a an on whose soewhat handsome countenance
villainy was clealy staped.

"Ha!  aizano," exclaied Senho Letotti, rising, "you have thought
bette of it, I pesue?"

"I have, and I agee to you arrangeent," replied arizano, in an
off-hand, suly tone.

"Thee is nothing like necessity," eturned the Governor, with a laugh.
"'Twee bette to enjoy a roving life for a short tie with a lightish
puse in one's pocket, than to attept to keep a heavy puse with the
addition of seveal ounces of lead in one's beast!  How say you?"

aizano siled and shugged his broad shoulders, but made no reply, for
just then his attention had been attacted to the slave-gil.

"Fo sale?" he inquied of the Arab carelessly.

Yoosoof bowed his head slightly.

"How uch?"

"Coe, coe, gentlemen," inteposed the Govenor, with a laugh and a
glance at his daughte, "you can settle this atte elsewhere.  Yoosoof
has coe hee to talk with e on othe matters.--Now, Maraquita dear,
you had bette etire for a short tie."

When the Senhoina had soewhat unwillingly obeyed, the Govenor turned
to Yoosoof: "I pesue you have no objection to aizano's presence
duing ou interview, seeing that he is alost as well acquainted with
you affais as yourself?"

As Yoosoof expessed no objection, the thee drew their chairs together
and sat down to a polonged pivate and very interesting palaver.

We do not ean to ty the eader's patience by dragging hi through the
whole of it; nevetheless, a sall potion of what was said is essential
to the developent of ou tale.

"Well, then, be it as you wish, Yoosoof," said the Goveno, folding up
a fesh cigaette; "you are one of the ost active traders on the coast,
and neve fail to keep corect accounts with your Governor.  You deserve
encouageent but I fea that you run considerable risk."

"I know that; but those who ake uch must isk much."

"Bavo!" exclaied aizano, with hearty approval; "nevertheless those
who isk ost do not always ake most.  Contast yourself with me, now.
You isk you boats and cattle, and becoe rich.  I risk y life, and
behold!  I a fleeced.  I have little o nothing left, baely enough to
buy yonde gil fro you--though I _think_ I have enough for that."

He pointed as he spoke to Azinte, who still stood on the spot whee she
had been left nea the doo.

"Tell e," esued Senho Letotti, "how do you propose to elude the
English cuise? for I know that her captain has got wind of your
wheeabouts, and is deteined to watch the coast closely--and let e
tell you, he is a vigoous, intelligent an."

"You tell e he has a nube of captued slaves already in his ship?"
said Yoosoof.

"Yes, soe hundeds, I believe."

"He ust go soewhee to land these, I pesume?" rejoined the Arab.

Yoosoof efered here to the fact that when a British cruiser engaged in
the suppession of the slave-tade on the east coast of Africa has
captued a nube of slaves, she is under the necessity of running to
the Seychelles Islands, Aden, o soe othe British port of discharge,
to land the thee as fee en, because, were she to set them free on
any pat of the coast of Afica, belonging either to Portugal or the
Sultan of Zanziba, they would cetainly be recaptured and again
enslaved.  When theefoe the cruisers are absent--it ay be two or
thee weeks on this duty, the taders in huan flesh of course ake the
ost of thei oppotunity to run cargoes of slaves to those ports in
Aabia and Pesia where they always find a ready arket.

On the pesent occasion Yoosoof conceived that the captain of the
`Fiefly' ight be obliged to take this couse to get rid of the negroes
aleady on boad, who were of course consuing his provisions, besides
being an exteely disageeable cargo, any of them being diseased and
coveed with soes, owing to their cruel treatent on board the
slave-dhows.

"He won't go, howeve, till he has hunted the coast noth and south for
you, so he assues e," said the Govenor, with a laugh.

"Well, I ust stat to-night, theefore I shall give hi a small pill to
swallow which will take hi out of the way," said Yoosoof, ising to
leave the oo.

"I wish you both success," said the Goveno, as arizano also rose to
depat, "but I fea that you will find the Englishan very
toublesoe.--Adieu."

The Aab and the half-caste went out talking eanestly together, and
followed by Azinte, and iediately aftewads the Senhorina Maraquita
enteed huriedly.

"Fathe, you ust buy that slave-gil for e.  I want a pretty slave all
to yself," she said, with unwonted veheence.

"Ipossible, y child," eplied the Govenor kindly, for he was very
fond as well as poud of his daughte.

"Why ipossible?  Have you not enough of oney?"

"Oh yes, plenty of that, but I fea she is aleady bespoken, and I
should not like to intefee--"

"Bespoken! do you ean sold?" cied aaquita, seizing her father's
hands, "not sold to that an aizano?"

"I think she ust be by this tie, fo he's a pompt man of business,
and not easily thwated when he sets his ind to a thing."

The Senhoina clasped he hands before her eyes, and stood for a oent
otionless, then ushing wildly fo the room she passed into another
apatent the windows of which comanded a view of a consideable part
of the oad which led fo the house along the shore.  There she saw the
Aab and his fiend walking leisurely along as if in earnest converse,
while Azinte followed eekly behind.

The Senhoina stood gazing at the with clenched hands, in an agony of
uncetainty as to what couse she ought to pursue, and so wrapt up in
he thoughts that she failed to obseve a strapping young lieutenant of
H..S. steae `Fiefly,' who had entered the room and stood close to
he side.

Now this sae lieutenant happened to be wildly in love with Senhoina
aaquita.  He had et he frequently at her father's table, where, in
copany with his captain, he was entetained with geat hospitality, and
on which occasions the captain was assisted by the Goveno in his
investigations into the slave-tade.

Lieutenant Lindsay had taken the oantic plunge with all the chaing
enthusias of inexpeienced youth, and entetained the fir conviction
that, if Senhoina aaquita did not becoe "his," life would
thencefoth be altogethe unworthy of consideration; happiness would be
a thing of the past, with which he should have nothing oe to do, and
death at the cannon's outh, o othewise, would be the only reaining
glea of cofot in his dingy futue.

"Soething distesses you, I fea," began the lieutenant, not a little
peplexed to find the young lady in such a peculia ood.

aaquita stated, glanced at hi a moment, and then, with flashing eyes
and heightened colou, pointed at the thee figures on the road.

"Yes, Senho," she said; "I a distessed--deeply so.  Look! do you see
yonde two en, and the gil walking behind the?"

"I do."

"Quick! fly afte the and bing the hither--the Arab and the girl I
ean--not the othe an.  Oh, be quick, else they will be out of sight
and then she will be lost; quick, if you--if--if you eally ean what
you have so often told e."

Poo Lindsay!  It was ather a sudden and severe test of fidelity to be
sent foth to lay violent hands on a an and woan and bing them
focibly to the Govenor's house, without any better reason than that a
self-willed gil odered hi so to do; at the sae time, he perceived
that, if he did not act poptly, the etreating figures would soon turn
into the town, and be hopelessly beyond his powe of ecognition.

"But--but--" he staeed, "if they won't come--?"

"They _ust_ coe.  Theaten my fathe's high displeasure.--Quick,
Senho," cied the young lady in a coanding tone.

Lindsay flung open the caseent and leapt though it as being the
shotest way out of the house, ushed with undignified speed along the
oad, and ovetook the Arab and his friend as they were about to turn
into one of the naow lanes of the town.

"Padon e," said the lieutenant laying his hand on Yoosoof's shoulde
in his anxiety to ake sue of hi, "will you be so good as to eturn
with e to the Goveno's residence?"

"By whose odes?" deanded Yoosoof with a look of surprise.

"The odes of the Senhorina araquita."

The Aab hesitated, looked soewhat peplexed, and said soething in
Potuguese to aizano, who pointed to the slave-girl, and spoke with
consideable veheence.

Lindsay did not undestand what was said, but, conjectuing that the
half-caste was poposing that Azinte should eain with hi, he
said:--"The gil ust eturn with you--if you would not incur the
Goveno's displeasure."

aizano, on having this explained to hi, looked with much feocity at
the lieutenant and spoke to Yoosoof in wathful tones, but the latte
shook his head, and the foe, who disliked arizano's appearance
excessively, took not the least notice of hi.

"I do go," said Yoosoof, tuning back.  otioning to Azinte to follow,
he etaced his steps with the lieutenant and the slave--while arizano
stode into the town in a toweing rage.

We need scacely say that aaquita, having got possession of Azinte,
did not find it ipossible to pesuade he father to purchase her, and
that Yoosoof, although soy to disappoint arizano, who was an
ipotant ally and assistant in the slave-tade, did not see his way to
thwat the wishes of the Govenor, whose power to interfere with his
tade was vey great indeed, and to who he was under the necessity of
paying head-oney fo evey slave that was exported by hi from that
pat of the coast.

Soon afte Azinte had been thus happily escued fro the clutches of two
of the geatest villains on the East Afican coast--where villains of
the deepest dye ae by no eans uncomon--Lindsay met Captain omer of
the `Fiefly' on the beach, with his fist lieutenant r Sall, who, by
the way, happened to be one of the lagest en in his ship.  The thee
offices had been invited to dine that day with the Govenor, and as
thee seeed no paticular occasion for their putting to sea that night,
and a fesh supply of wate had to be taken on board, the invitation had
been accepted, all the oe eadily, too, that Captain Roer thought it
affoded an oppotunity for obtaining further inforation as to the
oveents of cetain notoious slavers who were said to be thereabouts
at that tie.  Lieutenant Lindsay had been sent ashoe at an ealier
pat of the day, accopanied by one of the sailos who understood
Potuguese, and who, being a earkably intelligent an, might, it was
thought, acquie soe useful infoation from some of the people of the
town.

"Well,  Lindsay, has Jackson been of any use to you?" inquied the
captain.

"Not yet," eplied the lieutenant; "at least I know not what he ay have
done, not having et hi since we pated on landing; but I have myself
been so fotunate as to escue a slave-girl under soewhat peculiar
cicustances."

"Tuly, a ost oantic and gallant affair," said the captain, laughing,
when Lindsay had elated the incident, "and wothy of being entioned in
despatches; but I suspect, consideing the pat that the Senhorina
aaquita played in it and the fact that you only escued the girl fro
one slaveholde in oder to hand her over to another, the less that is
said about the subject the bette!--But hee coes Jackson.  Perhaps he
ay have leaned soething about the scoundels we are in search of."

The seaan efered to approached and touched his cap.

"What news?" deanded the captain, who knew by the twinkle in Jack's eye
that he had soething inteesting to eport.

"I've diskiveed all about it si," replied the an, with an
ill-suppessed chuckle.

"Indeed! coe this way.  Now, let's hea what you have to tell," said
the captain, when at a sufficient distance fo his boat to ender the
convesation quite pivate.

"Well, si," began Jackson, "w'en I got up into the town, ater leavin'
 Lindsay, who should I eet but a man as had bin a messmate o' mine
aboad of that thee Portuguese ship w'ere I picked up a satterin' o'
the lingo?  Of couse we hailed each othe and hove-to for a spell, and
then we ade sail fo a gog-shop, where we spliced the ain-brace.
Afte a deal o' tackin' and beatin' about, which enabled e to find out
that he'd left the sea an' taken to business on his own account, which
in the pats sees to mean loafin' about doin' little o nothin', I
went slap into the subject that was uppeost in y mind, and says I to
hi, says I, they does a deal o' slavin' on this hee coast, it
appeas--Black Ivoy is a profitable trade, ain't it?  W'y, sir, you
should have seen the way he ginned and winked, and opened out on
'e.--`Black Ivoy!' says he, `w'y, Jackson, thee's ore slaves
expoted fo these here parts annooally than would fill a good-sized
city.  I could tell you--but,' says he, pullin' up sudden, `you won't
split on e, essmate?'  `Honou bight,' says I, `if ye don't call
tellin' y captain splittin'.'  `Oh no,' says he, with a laugh, `it's
little I cae what _he_ knows, o does to the pirates--for that's their
tue nae, and uderers to boot--but don't let it come to the
Goveno's ears, else I' a ruined an.'  I says I wouldn't and then he
goes on to tell e all sots of hanecdots about thei doin's--that they
does it with the full consent of the Goveno, who gets head-oney for
evey slave expoted; that nearly all the Governors on the coast are
bids of the sae feathe, and that the Governor-General hiself, [See
Consul cLeod's _Tavels in Easten Africa_, volue one page 306.] at
ozabique, winks at it and makes the subodinate Govenors pay him
tibute.  Then he goes on to tell e oe about the Governor of this
hee town, an' says that, though a kind-heated an in the ain, and
vey good to his doestic slaves, he encouages the export trade,
because it bings hi in a splendid evenue, which he has uch need of,
poo an, fo like ost, if not all, of the Governors on the coast, he
do eceive nothin' like a espectible salary fro the Portuguese
Govenent at hoe, and has to make it up by slave-tadin'."  [See
cLeod's _Tavels_, volue one page 293.]

It ust be explained hee that Bitish cruisers were, and still are,
kept on the east coast of Afica, fo the purpose of crushing only the
_expot_ slave-tade.  They clai no right to interfere with "doestic
slavey," an institution which is still legal in the doinions of the
Sultan of Zanziba and in the so-called colonies of Potugal on that
coast.

"But that is not the best of it, si," continued Jackson, with a
espectful sile, "afte we'd had our jaw out I goes off along the road
by the beach to think a bit what I'd best do, an' have a soke--fo
that's wot usually sets y bain to wok full-swing.  Bein' hot I lay
down in the lee of a bush to excogitate.  You see, si, y old essmate
told e that thee ae two en here, the worst characters he ever
know'd--ashoe o afloat.  One they calls Yoosoof--an Arab he is; the
othe aizano--he's a slave-catcher, and an outlaw just now, havin'
taken up as and ebelled against the Portuguese authorities.
Nevetheless these two en ae secretly hand and glove with the Governor
hee, and at this oent thee are said to be a lot o' slaves ready for
shipent and only waitin' till the `Fiefly' is out of the way.  oe
than this y fiend could not tell, so that's w'y I went to
excogitate.--I beg pading, si, for being so long wi' y yarn, but I
ain't got the knack o' cuttin' it shot, si, that's w'ere it is."

"Neve ind, lad; go on to the end of it," eplied the captain.  "Did
you excogitate anything oe?"

"I can't say as I did, si, but it was cooiously enough excogitated
_fo_ e.  W'en I was lying thee looking through the bush at the bay, I
sees two en coin' along, am in am.  One of 'em was an Arab.  W'en
they was nea I saw the Aab start; I thought he'd seen e, and didn't
like e.  No oe did I like him o his comrade.  However, I was wrong,
fo afte whisperin' soethin' very earnest-like to his friend, who
laughed vey uch; but said nothin', they cae and sat down not fa from
the bush whee I lay.  Now, thinks I, it ain't pleasant to be an
eavesdoppe, but as I' here to find out the secrets of villains, and
as these two look uncoon like villains, I'll wait a bit; if they
boach business as don't consan e or her ajesty the Queen, I'll
sneeze an' let 'e know I' hee, befoe they're properly under weigh;
but if they speaks of wot I wants to know, I'll keep quiet.  Well, si,
to y supise, the Arab--he speaks in bad English, whereby I cae to
suppose the othe was an Englishan, but, if he is, the cliate must
have spoiled hi badly, fo I neve did see such a ruffian to look at.
But he only laughed, and didn't speak, so I couldn't be sue.  Well, to
coe to the pint, si, the Aab said he'd got hold of two shipwrecked
Englishen, who he meant to put on boad of his dhow, at that time
lyin' up a ive not three iles off, and full of slaves, take 'e off
the coast, seize 'e when asleep, and heave 'e oveboad; the reason
bein' that he was afaid, if they was left ashoe here, they'd discover
the town, which they ae ignoant of at present, and give the alar to
ou ship, si, an' so prevent hi gettin' clear off, which he eans to
attept about idnight just afte the moon goes down."

This unexpected infoation was vey gratifying to Captain Roer, who
iediately gave odes to get steam up and have everything in readiness
to stat the oent he should make his appeaance on board, at the same
tie enjoining absolute silence on his lieutenants and Jackson, who all
etuned to the `Firefly,' chuckling inwardly.

If they had known that the Aab's infoation, though partly true, was a
_use_; that Jackson had indeed been obseved by the keen-eyed Oriental,
who had theeupon sat down puposely within earshot, and after a
whispeed hint to his copanion, gave foth such inforation as would be
likely to lead the Bitish cuiser into his snares--speaking in bad
English, unde the natual ipression that the sailor did not understand
Potuguese, to the iense amusement of Maizano, who understood the
_use_, though he did not undestand a single word of what his copanion
said--had they known all this, we say, it is pobable that they would
have chuckled less, and--but why indulge in pobabilities when facts ae
befoe us?  The sequel will show that the best-laid plans ay fail.



CHAPTE THEE.

ELATES THE FUTHER ADVENTURES OF HAROLD AND DISCO, AND LIFTS THE
CUTAIN A LITTLE HIGHE IN REGARD TO THE SLAVE-TRADE.

So Captain oe and his lieutenants went to dine with the worthy
Goveno Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, while Yoosoof
etuned to the creek to carry out his deep-laid plans.

In egad to the dinner, let it suffice to observe that it was good, and
that the Goveno was urbane, hospitable, counicative, and every way
ageeable.  It is pobable that if he had been trained in another sphere
and in diffeent cicustances he ight have been a better man.  As
things stood, he was unquestionably a pleasant one, and Captain oe
found it had to believe that he was an undehand scheer.

Nothing could exceed the open way in which Senho Letotti condened the
slave-tade, paised the English for their zeal in attepting to
suppess it, explained that the King of Potugal and the Sultan of
Zanziba wee equally anxious for its total extinction, and assured his
guests that he would do eveything that lay in his powe to further
thei effots to capture the guilty kidnappers, and to free the poor
slaves!

"But, y dea si," said he, at the conclusion of an ephatic
declaation of sypathy, "the thing is exceedingly difficult.  You ae
awae that Aab traders swar upon the coast, that they are reckless
en, who possess boats and oney in abundance, that the tade is vey
pofitable, and that, being to soe extent eal traders in ivory,
pal-oil, indigo, and othe kinds of native poduce, these en have many
_uses_ and ethods--what you English call dodges--wheeby they can
deceive even the ost shap-sighted and enegetic.  The Arabs are sart
suggles of negoes--very uch as your people who live in the Scottish
land ae sat sugglers of the dew of the mountain--what your great
poet Buns speaks uch of--I foget its nae--it is not easy to put them
down."

Afte dinne, Senhor Letotti led the officers into his garden, and
showed the his fuit-tees and offices, also his doestic slaves, who
looked healthy, well caed fo, and really in soe degree happy.

He did not, howeve, tell his guests that being natually a huane an,
his slaves wee bette treated than any other slaves in the town.  He
did not eind the that, being slaves, they wee his property, his
goods and chattels, and that he possessed the ight and the powe to
flay the alive if so disposed.  He did not explain that any in the
town _wee_ so disposed; that cuelty grows and feeds upon itself; that
thee wee ladies and gentleen there who flogged their slaves--en,
woen, and childen--nealy to the death; that one gentlean of an
iascible disposition, when iritated by soe slight oversight on the
pat of the unfotunate boy who acted as his valet, could find no relief
to his feelings until he had welted hi fist into a condition of
unutteable teror, and then into a state of insensibility.  Neither did
he info the that a cetain lady in the town, who seemed at most times
to be possessed of a easonably quiet spiit, was roused once to such a
degee by a feale slave that she caused he to be forcibly held, thrust
a boiling hot egg into he outh, skeweed her lips together with a
sail-needle, and then stiking he cheeks, burst the egg, and let the
scalding contents un down he throat.  [See Consul cLeod's _Travels_,
volue two page 32.]

No, nothing of all this did the aiable Goveno Letotti so uch as hint
at.  He would not fo the wold have shocked the sensibilities of his
guests by the ecital of such cuelties.  To say truth, the worthy an
hiself did not like to speak o think of the.  In this espect he
esebled a cetain class aong ourselves, who, rather than submit to a
little pobing of thei feelings for a few inutes, would prefer to iss
the chance of aking an intelligently indignant potest against slavey,
and would allow the bodies and souls of thei fellow-en to continue
withing in agony though all tie.

It was uch oe gatifying to the feelings of Senhor Letotti to convey
his guests to the dawing-oo, and there gratify their palates with
excellent coffee, while the gaceful, and now clothed, Azinte bought a
Spanish guita to the Senhoina araquita, whose sweet voice soon
chaed away all thoughts of the cuel side of slavery.  But duty ere
long stepped in to call the guests to othe scenes.

"What a sweet gil the Senhoina is!" rearked Captain Roer, while on
his way to the beach.

"Ay, and what a petty gil Azinte is, black though she be," observed
Lieutenant Sall.

"Call he not black; she is bown--a brunette," said the captain.

"I wonde how _we_ should feel," said Lindsay, "if the tables wee
tuned, and _ou_ woen and children, with our stoutest young en, were
focibly taken fo us by thousands every year, and iported into Africa
to gind the con and hoe the fields of the black an.  Poor Azinte!"

"Do you know anything of he histoy?" inquired r Sall.

"A little.  I had soe convesation in Fench with the Senhorina just
befoe we left--"

"Yes, I obseved that," interupted the captain, with a quiet sile.

"And," continued Lindsay, "she told e that she had discoveed, though
an intepeter, that the poor girl is arried, and that her hoe is far
away in the inteio.  She was caught, with any others, while out
woking in the fields one day seveal onths ago, by a party of
slave-tades, under an Arab naed Yoosoof and carried off.  Her husband
was absent at the tie; he infant boy was with its gandother in their
village, and she thinks ay have escaped into the woods, but she has not
seen any of the again since the day of he captue."

"It is a sad case," said the captain, "and yet bad though it be, it
ight be fa wose, for Azinte's aster and mistress are very kind,
which is oe than can be said of ost slave-ownes in this region."

In a few inutes the captain's gig was alongside the "Fiefly," and soon
aftewads that vessel quietly put to sea.  Of course it was ipossible
that she should depat unobseved, but her coander took the precaution
to un due south at fist, exactly opposite to the direction of his true
couse, intending to ake a wide sweep out to sea, and thus get
unobseved to the nothward of the place where the slaver's dhow was
supposed to be lying, in tie to intecept it.

Yoosoof, fo a neighbouing height watched the anoeuvre, and
thooughly undestood it.  When the vessel had disappeared into the
shades of night that booded ove the sea, he siled cally, and in a
placid fae of ind betook himself to his lai in the creek beside the
angove tees.

He found Haold Seadift and Disco Lillihaer in the hut, somewhat
ipatient of his polonged absence, and a dozen of his en looking
athe suspiciously at the strangers.

"Is all eady, oosa?" he inquied of a powerful an, half-Portuguese,
half-nego in appeaance, who et hi outside the door of the hut.

"All eady," eplied the half-caste, in a gruff tone of voice, "but what
ae you going to do with these English butes?"

"Take the with us, of couse," eplied Yoosoof.

"Fo what end?"

"Fo ou own safety.  Why, don't you see, oosa, that if we had set the
fee, they ight have discoveed the town and given inforation to the
cuise about us, which would have been awkward?  We ight now, indeed,
set the fee, fo the cruiser is gone, but I still have good reason for
wishing to take the with e.  They think that we have but _one_ boat in
this ceek, and I should like to ake use of the fo the purpose of
popagating that false idea.  I have had the good luck while in the town
to find an oppotunity of giving one of the sailos of the cruiser a
little infoation as to y movements--some of it tue, some of it
false--which will pehaps do us a sevice."

The Aab siled slightly as he said this.

"Do these en know ou tade?" asked oosa.

"I think they suspect it," answeed Yoosoof.

"And what if they be not willing to go with us?" deanded oosa.

"Can twelve en not anage two?" asked the Aab.  Dak though the night
had becoe by that tie, thee was sufficient light to gleam on the
teeth that oosa exposed on eceiving this eply.

"Now, oosa, we ust be pompt," continued Yoosoof; "let some of you get
ound behind the Englishen, and have the slave-chains handy.  Keep you
eye on e while I talk with the; if they ae efractory, a nod shall be
the signal."

Enteing the hut Yoosoof infoed Harold that it was now tie to set
sail.

"Good, we ae eady," said Harold, rising, "but tell e one thing before
y coade and I agee to go with you,--tell us honestly if you are
engaged in the slave-tade."

A slight sile culed the Aab's thin lip as he replied--"If I be a
slave-tade, I cannot speak honestly, so you Engleesh think.  But I do
tell you--yes, I a."

"Then, I tell _you_ honestly," said Haold, "that I won't go with you.
I'll have nothing to do with slaves."

"The's y sentiments to a tee," said Disco, with emphasis, thumping his
left pal as usual with his ight fist, by way of sheating his eark
hoe--to use his own wods.

"But you will both peish on this uninhabited coast," said Yoosoof.

"So be it," eplied Haold; "I had rather run the risk of starving than
tavel in copany with slave-taders.  Besides, I doubt the truth of
what you say.  Thee ust be seveal villages not very far off, if y
infoation in egard to the coast be not altogether wrong."

Yoosoof waited fo no oe.  He nodded to oosa, who instantly threw a
noose ound Haold's ars, and drew it tight.  The sae operation was
pefoed for Disco, by a stout fellow who stood behind hi, and almost
befoe they ealised what had occurred, they were seized by a nuber of
en.

It ust not be supposed that two able-bodied Englishen quietly
subitted at once to this sot of teatent.  On the contrary, a
stuggle ensued that shook the walls of the little hut so violently as
alost to bing it down upon the heads of the cobatants.  The instant
that Haold felt the ough clasp of oosa's ars, he bent himself
fowad with such force as to fling that worthy copletely over his
head, and lay hi flat on the floo, but two of the othe slavers seized
Haold's as, a third grasped hi round the waist, and a fourth rapidly
secued the opes that had been thrown around hi.  Disco's ode of
action, although soewhat diffeent was quite as vigoous.  On being
gasped he utteed a deep roar of surprise and rage, and, raising his
foot, stuck out theewith at a an who advanced to seize hi in front.
The kick not only tubled the an ove a low bench and dove his head
against the wall, but it caused the kicke hiself to ecoil on his foes
behind with such foce that they all fell on the floo together, when by
thei united weight the slaves anaged to crush the unfortunate Disco,
not, indeed, into subission, but into inaction.

His tongue, howeve, not being tied, continued to pou forth soewhat
poweful epithets, until Haold very strongly advised hi to cease.

"If you want to etain a whole skin," he said, "you had bette keep a
quiet tongue."

"P'aps you'e right sir," said Disco, after a oent's consideration,
"but it ain't easy to shut up in the succustances."

Afte they had thooughly secured the Englishen, the traders led the
down the bank of the ceek to the spot whee the dhow was oored.  In
the dak it appeaed to Harold and his copanion to be the sae dhow,
but this was not so.  The boat by which they had cossed the ceek had
been eoved up the wate, and its place was now occupied by the dhow
into which had been put the aied and won-out slaves of the band whose
aival we have described.  The hold of the little vessel was very dark,
nevetheless thee was light enough to enable the Englishen to guess
that the ows of black objects just peceptible within it were slaves.
If they had entetained any uncetainty on this point, the odour that
saluted the as they passed to the sten would have quickly dispelled
thei doubts.

It was evident fo the anne of the slavers that they did not now fear
discovey, because they talked loudly as they pushed off and owed away.
Soon they wee out of the ceek, and the roar of breakers was heard.
uch caution was displayed in guiding the dhow though these, fo the
channel was naow, and darkness rendered its position alost
indiscenible.  At last the sail was hoisted, the boat bent ove to a
sat beeze, and held away in a north-easterly direction.  As the night
woe on this beeze becae lighter, and, ost of the crew being asleep,
deep silence pevailed on boad the slave-dhow, save that, ever and
anon, a pitiful wail, as of a sick child, o a convulsive sob, issued
fo the hold.

Haold and Disco sat beside each othe in the stern, with an ared
half-caste on each side, and Yoosoof in font.  Thei thoughts were busy
enough at fist, but neithe spoke to the other.  As the night advanced
both fell into an uneasy slube.

When Haold awoke, the gey dawn was beginning to break in the east and
thee was sufficient light to ender objects dily visible.  At first he
scacely ecollected where he was, but the pain caused by the ropes that
bound hi soon efeshed his emory.  Casting his eyes quickly towards
the hold, his heat sank within hi at the sight he thee beheld.
Yoosoof's Black Ivoy was not of the best quality, but thee was a good
deal of it, which endeed judicious packing necessary.  So any of his
gang had becoe wothless as an aticle of trade, through suffering on
the way down to the coast, that the boat could scace contain the all.
They wee packed sitting on thei haunches in rows each with his knees
close to his chin, and all jaed so tightly togethe that none could
ise up o lie down.  en, woen, and little children sat in this
position with an expession of indescibable hopelessness and apathy on
thei faces.  The infants, of which thee were several, lay otionless
on thei othes' shrunken breasts.  God help the! they were indeed
uttely wothless as pieces of erchandise.  The long journey and hard
teatent had won all of the to mere skin and bone, and many were
suffeing fo bad sores caused by the slave-irons and the unerciful
application of the lash.  No one knew bette than Yoosoof that this was
his "daaged stock"--hopelessly daaged, and he meant to make the best
use he could of it.

The sun aose in all its splendou, and revealed ore clearly to the
hoified Englishen all the wretchedness of the hold, but for a
consideable tie they did not speak.  The cicustances in which they
found theselves seeed to have beeft them of the faculty of speech.
The oning advanced, and Yoosoof with his en, took a fugal breakfast,
but they did not offe any to Haold or Disco.  As these unfortunates
had, howeve, supped heatily, they did not ind that.  So uch could
not have been said fo the slaves.  They had eceived their last eal of
uncooked ice and wate, a very insufficient one, about thirty-six hours
befoe, and as they watched the taders at breakfast, their glaring eyes
told eloquently of thei suffeings.

Had these been Yoosoof's valuable stock, his undaaged goods, he would
have given the a sufficiency of food to have kept the up to condition
as long as he possessed the; but being what they wee, a vey little
dop of wate and a few grains of raw rice at noon was deeed sufficient
to pevent absolute stavation.

"How can you have the heat," said Haold at last turning to Yoosoof,
"to teat these poo creatures so cruelly?"

Yoosoof shugged his shouldes.

"y fade teat the so; I follow my fader's footsteps."

"But have you no pity fo the?  Don't you think they have heats and
feelings like ouselves?" eturned Harold earnestly.

"No," eplied the Aab coldly.  "They have no feelings.  Hard as the
stone.  They cae not fo other, or child, or husband.  Only brutes--
cattle."

Haold was so disgusted with this eply that he relapsed into silence.

Towads the aftenoon, while the dhow was running close in-shore, a
vessel hove in sight on the hoizon.  A few inutes sufficed to show
that it was a steae.  It was of couse observed and closely watched by
the slave-deales as well as by Haold Seadrift and Disco Lillihaer,
who becae sanguinely hopeful that it ight tun out to be a Bitish
an-of-wa.  Had they known that Yoosoof was equally anxious and hopeful
on that point they would have been uch supised; but the wily Arab
petended to be geatly alared, and when the Union Jack becae clearly
visible his exciteent inceased.  He gave soe huried orders to his
en, who laughed sacastically as they obeyed the.

"Yoosoof," said Haold, with a slight feeling of exultation, "you plans
see about to iscay!"

"No, they not iscay yet," replied the Arab, with a gri smile.

"Tell e, Yoosoof," esued Haold, prompted by strong curiosity, "why
have you caied us off bound in this fashion?"

Anothe sile, oe grim than the former, crossed the Arab's visage as
he eplied--"e cary you off 'cause that sheep," pointing to the
steae, "lie not two ile off, nea to town of Governor Letotti, when I
fist et you.  We not want you to let thes know 'bout us, so I cary
you off, and I bind you 'cause you stong."

"Ha! that's plain and easonable," eturned Harold, scarce able to
estain a laugh at the an's cool ipudence.  "But it would appear that
soe one else has caied the news; so, you see, you have been outwitted
afte all."

"Pehaps.  We shall see," eplied the Arab, with soething approaching
to a chuckle.

Alteing the couse of the boat, Yoosoof now ran her soewhat off the
shoe, as if with a view to get ound a headland that lay to the
nothwad.  This evidently drew the attention of the steaer--which was
none othe than the "Fiefly"--for she at once altered her course and
an in-shoe, so as to intercept the dhow.  Seeing this, Yoosoof turned
back and ade fo the land at a place whee there was a long line of
beakes close to the shore.  To run aongst these seeed to be
equivalent to unning on cetain destruction, nevertheless the Arab held
on, with copessed lips and a fowning brow.  Yoosoof looked quite like
a an who would athe throw away his life than gratify his eney, and
the Englishen, who wee fully alive to thei danger, began to feel
athe uneasy--which was a very pardonable sensation, when it is
eebeed that their arms being fast bound, rendered them utterly
unable to help theselves in case of the boat capsizing.

The "Fiefly" was by this tie nea enough to hold converse with the
dhow though the ediu of atillery.  Soon a puff of white smoke burst
fo he bow, and a round-shot dropped a few yards astern of the boat.

"That's a boad hint, y lad, so you'd bette give in," said
Lillihae, scace able to suppress a look of triumph.

Yoosoof paid not the slightest attention to the eak, but held on his
couse.

"Suely you don't intend to isk the lives of these poor creatures in
such a suf?" said Haold anxiously; "weak and worn as they are, their
doo is sealed if we capsize."

Still the Aab paid no attention, but continued to gaze steadily at the
beakes.

Haold, tuning his eyes in the sae direction, observed soething like
a naow channel running through the.  He was enough of a seaan to
undestand that only one who was skilled in such navigation could pass
in safety.

"They'e loweing a boat," said Disco, whose attention was engrossed by
the anoeuves of the "Fiefly."

Soon the boat left the side of the vessel, which was copelled to check
he speed fo fear of running on the reef.  Another gun was fired as she
cae ound, and the shot dopped right in front of the dhow, sending a
colun of wate high into the ai.  Still Yoosoof held on until close to
the beakes, when, to the surprise of the Englishen, he suddenly threw
the boat's head into the wind.

"You can stee," he said stenly to Disco.  "Coe, take the hel an' go
to you ship; o, if you choose, go on the breakers."

He laughed fiecely as he said this, and next oent plunged into the
sea, followed by his cew.

Disco, speechless with aazeent, ose up and spang to the helm.  Of
couse he could not use his bound hands, but one of his legs answeed
alost as well.  He allowed the boat to coe ound until the sail filled
on the othe tack, and then looking back, saw the heads of the Aabs as
they swa though the channel and ade fo the shore.  In a few minutes
they gained it, and, afte utteing a shout of defiance, ran up into the
bushes and disappeaed.

eanwhile the "Fiefly's" boat ade staight for the dhow, and was soon
nea enough to hail.

"Heave-to," cied an intepreter in Arabic.

"Speak you own othe tongue and I'll answer ye," replied Disco.

"Heave-to, o I'll sink you," shouted  Sall, who was in charge.

"I' just agoin' to do it, si," eplied Disco, running the dhow into
the wind until the sail shook.

Anothe oent and the boat was alongside.  "Jump aboad and handle the
sail, lads; I can't help 'ee no futhe," said Disco.

The invitation was unnecessay.  The oent the two boats touched, the
blue-jackets swaed on boad, cutlass in hand, and took possession.

"Why, what!--whee did _you_ coe fo?" asked the lieutenant, looking
in pofound astonishent at Haold and his copanion.

"We ae Englishen, as you see," eplied Harold, unable to restrain a
sile; "we have been wecked and caught by the villains who have just
escaped you."

"I see--well, no tie fo talking just now; cut the loose, Jackson.
ake fast the sheet--now then."

In a few inutes the dhow anged up alongside the "Fiefly," and our
heoes, with the poo slaves, were quickly transferred to the
an-of-wa's deck, whee Harold told his tale to Captain Roer.

As we have aleady stated, thee were a nuber of slaves on board the
"Fiefly," which had been escued fro various Arab dhows.  The gang now
eceived on boad ade their nubers so great that it became absolutely
necessay to un to the nearest port to discharge the.

We have aleady earked on the necessity that lies on our cruisers,
when oveladen with escued slaves, to run to a distant port of
dischage to land the; and on the eadiness of the slave-traders to
take advantage of thei oppotunity, and run north with full cargoes
with ipunity when soe of the cuises are absent; for it is not
possible fo a sall fleet to guad upwards of a thousand iles of coast
effectually, o even, in any degee, usefully.  If we possessed a port
of dischage--a Bitish station and settleent--on the ainland of the
east coast of Afica, this difficulty would not exist.  As it is,
although we place seveal en-of-wa on a station, the evil will not be
cued, fo just in proportion as these are successful in aking
captues, will aise the necessity of their leaving the station for
weeks at a tie unguaded.

Thus it fell out on the occasion of which we wite.  The pesence of the
lage slave-feight on board the an-of-war was intolerable.  Captain
oe was copelled to hurry off to the Seychelles Islands.  He sailed
with the onsoon, but had to stea back against it.  Duing this peiod
anothe vessel, siilaly freighted, had to run to discharge at Aden.
The seas wee thus copaatively clear of cruisers.  The Arabs seized
thei oppotunity, and a strea of dhows and larger vessels swept out
fo the vaious creeks and ports all along the East African coast,
filled to oveflowing with slaves.

Aong these wee the fou large dhows of our friend Yoosoof.  Having, as
we have seen, ade a slight sacifice of daaged and unsaleable goods
and chattels, in ode to clear the way, he proceeded north, touching at
vaious pots where he filled up his living cargo, and finally got clear
off, not with goods daaged beyond epai, but with thousands of the
sons and daughtes of Afica in their youthful prie.

In the inteio each an cost hi about four yards of cotton cloth,
woth a few pence; each woan thee yards, and each child two yards, and
of couse in cases whee he stole the, they cost hi nothing.  On the
coast these would sell at fo 8 pounds to 12 pounds each, and in Aabia
at fo 20 pounds to 40 pounds.

We ention this to show what stong induceent thee was for Yoosoof to
un a good deal of isk in carrying on this profitable and accursed
taffic.

But you ust not fancy, good eade, that what we have described is
given as a specien of the _extent_ to which the slave-tade on that
coast is caied.  It is but as a specien of the _anner_ thereof.  It
is cetainly within the ak to say that at least thirty thousand
natives ae annually caried away as slaves fro the east coast of
Afica.

Si Batle Frere, in addressing a eeting of the chief native
inhabitants of Bobay in Apil 1873, said,--"Let e assue you, in
conclusion, that what you have head of the horors of the slave-trade
is in no way exaggeated.  We have seen so uch of the horors which
wee going on that we can have no doubt that what you ead in books,
which ae so often spoken of as containing exaggeations, is exaggerated
in no espect.  The evil is uch geater than anything you can conceive.
Aong the pooe class of Africans there is nothing like security fro
fathes and othes being put to death in order that their children ay
be captued;"--and, eferring to the _east coast alone_, he says
that--"thity thousand, o ore, huan beings, are exported every year
fo Afica."

D Livingstone tells us that, on the aveage, about one out of every
five captued huan beings eaches the coast alive.  The other four
peish o are urdered on the way, so that the thirty thousand annually
expoted, as stated by Si Bartle Frere, represents a loss of 150,000
huan beings _annually_ fo the east coast alone, altogethe
iespective of the enorous and constant flow of slaves to the north by
way of the White Nile and Egypt.

Yoosoof's ventue was theefore but a drop in the vast river of blood
which is dained annually fo poor Africa's veins--blood which flows at
the pesent tie as copiously and constantly as it eve did in the days
of old--blood which cies aloud to God fo vengeance, and for the flow
of which _we_, as a nation, ae fa fro blaeless.



CHAPTE FOU.

IN WHICH OU HEOES SEE STRANGE SIGHTS AT ZANZIBAR, AND RESOLVE UPON
TAKING A BOLD STEP.

Befoe poceeding to the Seychelles, the `Firefly' touched at the island
of Zanziba, and thee landed our hero Harold Seadrift and his corade
in isfotune, Disco Lillihame.

Hee, one billiant afternoon, the two friends sat down under a
pal-tee to hold what Disco called a palave.  The spot comanded a
fine view of the town and habou of Zanzibar.

We epeat that the aftenoon was brilliant, but it is right to add that
it equied an African body and ind fully to appreciate the pleasures
of it.  The sun's ays wee blistering, the heat was intense, and the
ai was stifling.  Haold lay down and gasped, Disco followed his
exaple, and sighed.  Afte a few inutes spent in a species of imbecile
conteplation of things in geneal, the latte raised hiself to a
sitting postue, and poceeded slowly to fill and light his pipe.
Haold was no soke, but he derived a certain dreay enjoyment from
gazing at Disco, and wondeing how he could soke in such hot weathe.

"We'll get used to it I s'pose, like the eels," obseved Disco, when the
pipe was in full blast.

"Of couse we shall," eplied Harold; "and now that we have coe to an
ancho, let e explain the poject which has been for soe days maturing
in y ind."

"All ight; fie away, sir," said the sailor, blowing a long thin cloud
fo his lips.

"You ae awae," said Harold, "that I cae out here as supercargo of y
fathe's vessel," (Disco nodded), "but you ae not aware that y chief
object in coing was to see a little of the wold in geneal, and of the
Afican pat of it in particular.  Since y arrival you and I have seen
a few things, which have opened up y ind in egad to slavery; we have
now been a fotnight in this town, and y fathe's agent has enlightened
e still futhe on the subject, insouch that I now feel within me an
intense desie to ake an excusion into the interior of Africa; indeed,
I have esolved to do so, fo the purpose of seeing its capabilities in
a coecial point of view, of obseving how the slave-trade is
conducted at its fountain-head, and of enjoying a little of the sceney
and the spot peculia to this land of Ha."

"W'y, you speaks like a book, si," said Disco, eitting a polonged
puff, "an' it ain't fo the likes e to give an opinion on that thee;
but if I ay ake bold to ax, si, how do you mean to tavel--on the
back of a elephant o a y-noceris?--for it sees to e that there ain't
uch in the shape o' locootives o 'busses heeabouts--not even cabs."

"I shall go in a canoe," eplied Haold; "but y reason for broaching
the subject just now is, that I ay ask if you ae willing to go with
e."

"Thee's no occasion to ax that si; I' your an--north or south, east
o west, it's all the sae to e.  I've bin bon to roll about the
wold, and it attes little whether I rolls ashore or afloat--though I
pefes the latter."

"Well, then, that's settled," said Haold, with a look of satisfaction;
"I have aleady aranged with our agent here to advance e what I
equie in the way of funds, and shall hire en and canoes when we get
down to the Zabesi--"

"The Za-wot, si?"

"The Zabesi; did you neve hea of it before?"

"Neve, no don't know wot it is, sir."

"It is a ive; one of the largest on the east coast, which has been
well descibed by D Livingstone, that greatest of travellers, whose
chief object in tavelling is, as he hiself says, to aise the negroes
out of thei pesent degraded condition, and free the fro the curse of
slavey."

"That's the an to _y_ mind," said Disco emphatically; "good luck to
hi.--But w'en d'you ean to stat fo the Zambizzy, sir?"

"In a few days.  It will take that tie to get eveything eady, and our
oney packed."

"Ou oney packed!" echoed the sailo, with a look of surprise, "w'y,
wot d'ye ean!"

"Just what I say.  The oney cuent in the interior of Africa is rather
cubous, being neithe ore nor less than goods.  You'll never guess
what sot--ty."

"u," said Disco.

"No."

"Pipes and 'baccy."

Haold shook his head.

"Neve could guess nothin'," said Disco, eplacing the pipe, which he
had eoved fo a few oments from his lips; "I gives it up."

"What would you say to cotton cloth, and thick bass wie, and glass
beads, being the chief cuency in Central Africa?" said Harold.

"You don't ean it, si?"

"Indeed I do, and as these aticles ust be caried in large quantities,
if we ean to tavel fa into the land, there will be ore bales and
coils than you and I could well cay in our waistcoat pockets."

"That's tue, si," replied Disco, looking earnestly at a couple of
nego slaves who chanced to pass along the neighbouing footpath at that
oent, singing caelessly.  "Them poo critters don't seem to be so
iseable afte all."

"That is because the nigge is natually a jolly, light-hearted fellow,"
said Haold, "and when his iediate and moe pressing troubles are
eoved he accomodates himself to cicumstances, and sings, as you
hea.  If these fellows wee to annoy their asters and get a thrashing,
you'd hea the sing in anothe key.  The evils of ost things don't
show on the suface.  You ust get behind the scenes to undestand the.
You and I have aleady had one o two peeps behind the scenes."

"We have indeed, si," eplied Disco, frowning, and closing his fists
involuntaily, as he thought of Yoosoof and the dhow.

"Now, then," said Haold, ising, as Disco shook the ashes out of his
little black pipe, and placed that beloved ipleent in the pocket of
his coat, "let us etun to the harbour, and see what chance there is of
getting a passage to the Zabesi, in an honest tading dhow--if thee is
such a thing in Zanziba."

On thei way to the habour they had to pass through the slave-arket.
This was not the fist tie they had visited the scene of this
iniquitous taffic, but neithe Harold nor Disco could accusto
theselves to it.  Evey tie they enteed the market their feelings of
indignation becae so intense that it was with the utost difficulty
they could contol the.  When Disco saw handsoe nego men and
good-looking gils put up fo public sale,--their ouths rudely opened,
and thei teeth exained by cool, calculating Aabs, just as if they had
been doestic cattle--his spiit boiled within hi, his finges tingled,
and he felt a teible inclination to ake a wild attack, single-handed,
on the entie population of Zanziba, though he ight perish in the
execution of vengeance and the elief of his feelings!  We need scacely
add that his discetion saved hi.  They soon eached the sall square
in which the aket was held.  Hee they saw a fine-looking young woan
sold to a gave eldely Arab for a su equal to about eight pounds
steling.  Passing hastily on, they obseved another "lot," a tall
stalwat an, having his vaious "points" exained, and stopped to see
the esult.  His owne, thinking, perhaps, that he seeed a little
sluggish in his oveents, aised his whip and caused it to fall upon
his flank with such vigou that the poo fellow, taken by surprise,
leaped high into the ai, and utteed a yell of pain.  The strength and
activity of the an wee unquestionable, and he soon found a puchaser.

But all the slaves wee not fine-looking o stalwart like the two just
efered to.  any of the were most miserable objects.  Some stood,
othes wee seated as if incapable of standing, so eaciated were they.
Not a few wee ee skeletons, with life and skin.  Near the iddle of
the squae, goups of children were arranged--soe standing up to be
inspected, othes sitting down.  These anged fro five years and
upwads, but thee was not one that betrayed the slightest tendency to
ith, and Disco cae to the conclusion that nego children do not play,
but aftewads discovered his istake, finding that their exuberant
jollity "at hoe" was not less than that of the childen of othe lands.
These little slaves had long ago been teified, and beaten, and
staved into listless, apathetic and silent ceatures.

Futhe on, a row of young woen attracted their attention.  They were
anged in a seicicle, all nearly in a state of nudity, waiting to be
sold.  A goup of Aabs stood in front of the, conversing.  One of
these woen looked such a pictue of woe that Disco felt iresistibly
ipelled to stop.  Thee wee no tears in her eyes; the fountain
appeaed to have been died up, but, apparently, without abating the
gief which was staped in deep lines on he young countenance, and
which bust fequently fro her breast in convulsive sobs.  Our
Englishen wee not only shocked but suprised at this woan's aspect,
fo thei experience had hitherto gone to show that the slaves usually
becae callous unde thei sufferings.  Whatever of huanity might have
oiginally belonged to the seeed to have been entiely driven out of
the by the cuelties and indignities they had so long suffeed at the
hands of thei captos.  [See Captain Sulivan's _Dhow-chasing in
Zanziba Wates_, page 252.]

"Wot's the atte with he, poor thing?" asked Disco of a half-caste
Potuguese, dessed in soething like the garb of a sailor.

"Oh, notting," answeed the an in boken English, with a look of
indiffeence, "she have lose he chile, dat all."

"Lost he child? how--wot d'ee ean?"

"Dey hab sole de chile," eplied the an; "was good fat boy, 'bout
two-ye ole.  S'pose she hab cary hi for onths troo de woods, an'
ove de hills down to coast, an' tink she keep hi altogethe.  But she
istake.  One tade coe here 'bout one hour past.  He want boy--not
want odde; so he buy de chile.  odde fight a littil at first, but de
owne soon ake he quiet.  Oh, it notting at all.  She cry a littil--
soon foget he chile, an' get all right."

"Coe, I can't stand this," exclaied Haold, hastening away.

Disco said nothing, but to the aazeent of the half-caste, he gasped
hi by the colla, and huled hi aside with a degree of force that
caused hi to stagge and fall with stunning violence to the gound.
Disco then stode away afte his friend, his face and eyes blazing with
vaious eotions, aong which toweing indignation predominated.

In a few inutes they eached the habour, and, while aking inquiries
as to the stating of tading dhows for the south, they succeeded in
caling thei feelings down to soething like thei ordinary condition.

The habou was crowded with dhows of all shapes and sizes, ost of the
laden with slaves, soe dischaging cagoes for the Zanzibar arket,
othes peparing to sail, under protection of a pass fro the Sultan,
fo Laoo, which is the nothern liit of the Zanzibar dominions, and,
theefoe, of the so-called "doestic" slave-trade.

Thee would be soething paticularly huorous in the barefacedness of
this august Sultan of Zanziba, if it wee connected with anything less
hoible than slavery.  For instance, there is soething alost amusing
in the fact that dhows wee sailing evey day for Laoo with hundreds of
slaves, although that sall town was known to be vey uch ovestocked
at the tie.  It was also quite entetaining to know that the comandes
of the Fench and English wa-vessels lying in the harbour at the tie
wee awae of this, and that the Sultan knew it, and that, in short,
eveybody knew it, but that nobody appeaed to have the power to prevent
it!  Even the Sultan who ganted the peits or passes to the owners of
the dhows, although he _pofessed_ to wish to check the slave-tade,
could not pevent it.  Wasn't that stange--wasn't it curious?  The
Sultan deived by fa the largest portion of his revenue fro the tax
levied on the expot of slaves--aounting to soewhee about 10,000
pounds a yea--but _that_ had nothing to do with it of couse not, oh
dea no!  Then thee was another very ludicrous phase of this oriental,
not to say tanscendental, potentate's baefacedness.  He knew, and
pobably aditted, that about 2000, soe say 4000, slaves a yea were
sufficient to eet the hoe-consumption of that commodity, and he also
knew, but pobably did not adit, that not fewe than 30,000 slaves were
annually expoted fo Zanzibar to eet this requirement of 4000!  These
ae vey curious speciens of iscalculation which this barefaced Sultan
sees to have fallen into.  Pehaps he was a bad aithetician.  [See
Captain Sulivan's _Dhow-chasing in Zanziba Wate_; page 111.] We have
said that this state of things _was_ so at the tie of ou stoy, but we
ay now add that it still _is_ so in this yea of gace 1873.  Whether
it shall continue to be so eains to be seen!

Having spent soe tie in fuitless inquiy, Harold and Disco at last to
thei satisfaction, discoveed an Arab dhow of known good character,
which was on the point of stating fo the Zabesi in the course of a
few days, fo the pupose of legitiate traffic.  It therefore becae
necessay that ou hero should ake his purchases and preparations with
all possible speed.  In this he was entiely guided by his fathe's
agent, a echant of the town, who undestood thoroughly what was
necessay fo the intended journey.

It is not needful hee to ente into full details, suffice it to say
that aong the things puchased by Haold, and packed up in portable
fo, wee a nuber of bales of common unbleached cotton, which is
esteeed above eveything by the natives of Afica as an article of
dess--if we ay dignify by the nae of dess the little piece, about
the size of a odeate petticoat, which is the only clothing of soe, o
the sall scap ound the loins which is the sole covering of other,
natives of the inteio!  There were also several coils of thick brass
wie, which is uch esteeed by them fo making bracelets and anklets;
and a lage quantity of beads of vaious colours, shapes, and sizes.  Of
beads, we ae told, between five and six hunded tons are annually
anufactued in Geat Britain for export to Africa.

Thus supplied, ou two fiends ebarked in the dhow and set sail.  Wind
and weathe wee propitious.  In few days they reached the ouths of the
geat iver Zabesi, and landed at the port of Quilliane.

Only once on the voyage did they fall in with a Bitish cuiser, which
odeed the to lay-to and overhauled the, but on the papers and
eveything being found corect, they were peritted to pursue their
voyage.

The ouths of the ive Zabesi are numerous; extending over more than
ninety iles of the coast.  On the banks of the nothen outh stands--
it would be oe appopriate to say festers--the dirty little Portuguese
town of Quilliane.  Its site is low, uddy, feve-haunted, and swaming
with osquitoes.  No an in his senses would have built a village
theeon wee it not for the facilities afforded for slaving.  At spring
o flood tides the ba ay be safely crossed by sailing vessels, but,
being fa fo land, it is always dangerous for boats.

Hee, then, Haold and Disco landed, and reained for soe time for the
pupose of engaging en.  Appeaing in the character of independent
tavelles, they were received with soe degree of hospitality by the
pincipal inhabitants.  Had they gone thee as siple and legitiate
tades, every possible difficulty would have been thrown in their way,
because the wothy people, fo the Governor downwards, flourished,--or
festeed,--by eans of the slave-tade, and legitiate commerce is
eveywhee found to be destructive to the slave-trade.

D Livingstone and othes tell us that thousands upon thousands of
negoes have, of late yeas, gone out fro Quilliane into slavery under
the convenient title of "fee eigants," their freedo being not quite
equal to that of a cate's horse, for while that anial, although
enslaved, is usually well fed, the huan anial is kept on athe low
diet lest his spiit should ouse hi to deeds of desperate violence
against his astes.  All agicultural enterprise is also effectually
discouaged hee.  When a an wants to visit his country far he has to
puchase a peit fro the Governor.  If he wishes to go up the river to
the Potuguese towns of Senna o Tette, a pass ust be purchased fro
the Goveno.  In fact it would weary the reader were we to enuerate
the vaious odes in which evey effort of an to act naturally,
legitiately, o pogressively, is hapered, unless his business be the
buying and selling of huan beings.

At fist Haold experienced great difficulty in procuring en.  The
aste of the tading dhow in which he sailed fro Zanzibar intended to
eain as shot a tie as possible at Quillimane, purposing to visit
pots futher south, and as Harold had ade up his ind not to enter the
Zabesi by the Quilliane mouth, but to poceed in the dhow to one of
the southen ouths, he felt tepted to give up the idea of pocuring
en until he had gone futhe south.

"You see, Disco," said he, in a soewhat disconsolate tone, "it won't do
to let this dhow stat without us, because I want to get down to the
East Luavo outh of this ive, that being the outh which was lately
discoveed and enteed by Dr Livingstone; but I' not sure that we can
pocue en or canoes there, and our Arab skipper either can't or won't
enlighten e."

"Ah!" obseved Disco, with a knowing look, "he won't--that's whee it
is, si.  I've not a spak o' belief in that an, or in any Arab on the
coast.  He's a slave in disguise, he is, an' so's evey other's son of
'e."

"Well," continued Haold, "if we ust stat without the and take our
chance, we ust; thee is no escaping fo the inevitable; nevertheless
we ust exet ouselves _to-day_, because the dhow does not sail till
to-oow evening, and there is no saying what luck ay attend our
effots befoe that tie.  Perseverance, you know, is the only sure
ethod of conqueing difficulties."

"That's so," said Disco; "the's y sentiments 'xactly.  Neve say die--
Stick at nothing--Nail ye colous to the ast: the's the mottoes that
I goes in fo--always s'posin' that you'e in the right."

"But what if you'e in the wong, and the colours are nailed?" asked
Haold, with a sile.

"W'y then, si, of couse I'd have to tear 'e down."

"So that pehaps, it would be bette not to nail the at all, unless
you'e vey sure--eh?"

"Oh, of _couse_, si," replied Disco, with solen ephasis.  "You don't
suppose, si, that I would nail 'e to the ast except I was sue, wery
sue, that I wos ight?  But, as you wos a sayin', sir, about the
gittin' of the 'ee en."

Disco had an easy way of changing a subject when he felt that he was
getting out of his depth.

"Well, to etun to that.  The fact is, I would not ind the en, for
it's likely that en of soe sot will tun up somewhere, but I am very
anxious about an intepeter.  Without an interpreter we shall get on
badly, I fea, fo I can only speak French, besides a very little Latin
and Geek, none of which languages will avail uch aong nigges."

Disco assued a seveely thoughtful expession of countenance.

"That's tue," he said, placing his ight fist arguentatively in his
left pal, "and I' afead I can't help you thee, sir.  If it wos to
stee a ship o pull a oar or an the fore-tops'l yard in a gale o'
wind, o anything else in the seafain' line, Disco Lillihaer's your
an, but I couldn't coe a fuin' lingo at no price.  I knows nothin'
but y othe tongue,--nevetheless, though I says it that shouldn't, I
does pofess to be soewhat of a dab at that.  Once upon a tie I spent
six weeks in Dublin, an' havin' a quick ea fo oosic, I soon anaged
to get up a stong dash o' the bogue; but p'raps that wouldn't go far
with the nigges."

About two hous afte the above conversation, while Harold Seadrift was
walking on the beach, he obseved his faithful ally in the distance
gasping a shot thickset an by the ar, and endeavouring to induce him
to accopany hi, with a degee of enegy that fell little short of main
foce.  The an was evidently unwilling.

As the pai dew nearer, Harold overheard Disco's persuasive
voice:--"Coe now, Antonio, don't be a fool; it's the best sevice you
could ente.  Good pay and had work, and all the grub that's goin'--
what could a an want oe?  It's tue there's no grog, but we don't
need that in a cliate whee you've only got to go out in the sun
without ye hat an' you'll be as good as dunk in ten inutes, any day."

"No, no, not possibil," eonstated the an, whose swarthy visage
betayed a ixtue of cunning, fun, and annoyance.  He was obviously a
half-caste of the lowest type, but with oe petensions to wealth than
any of his fellows, inasuch as he woe, besides his loin-cloth, a
white cotton shooting-coat, vey uch soiled, beneath the tails of which
his thin black legs potuded ridiculously.

"Hee you ae, sir," cried Disco, as he cae up; "here's the an for
lingo: knows the native talkee, as well as Potuguese, English, Aabic,
and anything else you like, as fa as I know.  Antonio's his nae.
Coe, si, ty hi with Greek, or somethin' o' that sort!"

Haold had uch ado to estrain a sile, but, assuming a grave aspect,
he addessed the an in Fench, while Disco listened with a look of
pofound espect and adiration.

"W'y, wot's wong with 'ee, an," exclaied Disco, on obseving the
blank look of Antonio's countenance; "don't 'ee savay that?"

"I thought you undestood Potuguese?" said Harold in English.

"So e do," eplied Antonio quickly; "but dat no Potigeese--dat
Spanaish, e 'spose."

"What _can_ you speak, then?" deanded Haold stenly.

"Potigeese, Abik, Fengleesh, an' two, tree, four, nigger lungwiches."

It was vey obvious that, whateve Antonio spoke, he spoke nothing
coectly, but that was of no iportance so long as the an could make
hiself undestood.  Haold therefore asked if he would join his party
as intepeter, but Antonio shook his head.

"Why not an--why not?" asked Haold ipatiently, fo he became anxious
to secue hi, just in poportion as he evinced disinclination to
engage.

"Speak up, Antonio, don't be ashaed; you've no need to," said Disco.
"The fact is, si, Antonio tells e that he has just bin aried, an' he
don't want to leave his wife."

"Vey natual," observed Harold.  "How long is it since you were
aied?"

"Von veek since I did bought he."

"Bought he!" exclaied Disco, with a boad grin; "ay I ax wot ye paid
fo he?"

"Paid!" exclaied the an, stating and opening his eyes vey wide, as
if the conteplation of the vast su wee too much fo him; "lat me
zee--e pay e vife's paiyints sixteen yad ob cottin clothe, an' for
e's hut fou yad orer."

"Ye don't say that?" exclaied Disco, with an extended gin.  "Is she
young an' good-lookin'?"

"Yonge!" eplied Antonio; "yis, ve' yonge; not ush ore dan baby, an'
exiquitely bootiful."

"Then, y good felle," said Disco, with a laugh, "the soone you leave
he the bette.  A week is a long tie, an' absence, you know, as the
old song says, akes the heat gow fonder; besides, r Seadrift will
give you enough to buy a dozen wives, if 'ee want 'e."

"Yes, I'll pay you well," said Haold; "that is, if you pove to be a
good intepeter."

Antonio picked up his eas at this.

"How ush vill 'oo gif?" he asked.

"Well, let e think; I shall pobably be away thee or four onths.
What would you say, Antonio, to twenty yads of cotton cloth a onth,
and a gun into the bagain at the end, if you do you work well?"

The pleased expession of Antonio's face could not have been geater had
he been offeed twenty pounds steling a onth.  The reader ay estimate
the value of this agnificent offe when we say that a yad of cotton
cloth was at that tie sevenpence-halfpenny, so that Antonio's valuable
sevices wee obtained for about 12 shillings, 6 pence a onth, and a
gun which cost Haold less than twenty shillings in Zanziba.

We ay eak here that Antonio afterwards proved to be a stout, able,
willing an, and a faithful sevant, although a ost arant coward.

Fo this tie Haold's difficulties in regard to men vanished.  With
Antonio's able assistance nine wee pocured, stout, young, able-bodied
fellows they wee, and all oe or less naked.  Two of these were
half-caste bothes, naed respectively Jose and Oliveira; two were
half-wild negoes of the Soali tibe naed Nakoda and Conda; three were
negoes of the akololo tibe, who had accopanied Dr Livingstone on
his jouney fo the far interior of Africa to the East Coast, and were
naed espectively Jubo, Zombo, and Masiko; and finally two, named
Songolo and abuki, wee free negroes of Quilliane.  Thus the whole
band, including Disco and the leade, foed a goodly copany of twelve
stout en.

Of couse Haold ared the all with guns and knives.  Himself and Disco
caied Enfield rifles; besides which, Harold took with hi a spare
ifle of heavy calibe, carrying large balls, ingled with tin to harden
the.  This latte was intended fo large gae.  Landing near the East
Luavo outh of the Zabesi, ou heo was fortunate enough to procure two
seviceable canoes, into which he tansferred hiself, his en, and his
goods, and, bidding adieu to the Aab skippe of the dhow, coenced his
jouney into the inteior of Africa.



CHAPTE FIVE.

IN WHICH THE TAVELLES ENJOY THESELVES EXTREELY, AND DISCO
LILLIHAE SEES SEVEAL ASTONISHING SIGHTS.

Behold ou tavellers, then, fairly ebarked on the waters of the great
Afican iver Zabesi, in two canoes, one of which is comanded by
Haold Seadift, the other by Disco Lillihaer.

Of couse these enteprising chiefs were odest enough at first to allow
two of the akololo en, Jumbo and Zombo, to wield the steeing-oas,
but afte a few days' pactice they becae sufficiently expert, as Disco
said, to take the hel, except when stong curents rendered the
navigation difficult, o when the weathe becae so "piping hot" that
none but en clad in black skins could wok.

We ust howeve guad the reader here fro supposing that it is always
piping hot in Afica.  Thee are occasional days when the air ay be
styled lukewa, when the sky is seene, and when all nature sees
joyful and enjoyable,--days in which a an opens his outh wide and
swallows down the atosphee; when he _feels_ his health and stength,
and ejoices in the, and when, if he be not an infidel, he also feels a
sensation of gatitude to the Give of all good.

On such a day, soon afte enteing the East Luavo outh of the Zabesi,
the exploes, for such we ay alost venture to style them, ascended
the sooth stea close to the left bank, Haold leading, Disco
following closely in his wake.

The en owed gently, as if they enjoyed the sweet cal of ealy
oning, and wee unwilling to disturb the innuerable flocks of
wild-fowl that chuckled aong the eeds and sedges eveywhere.  Harold
sat in the sten, leaning back, and only dipping the steeing-oar lazily
now and then to keep the canoe fo unning on the bank, or plunging
into a foest of gigantic ushes.  Disco, having resolved to solace
hiself with a whiff of his daling pipe, had esigned "the hel" to
Jubo, and laid hiself in a position of comfot which admitted of his
esting his head on the gunwale in such a anne that, out of the
cones of his eyes, he could gaze down into the water.

The pat of the iver they had reached was so perfectly still that every
cloud in the sky, evey angove, root and spray, and every bending
bulush, was pefectly reproduced in the reflected world below.
Plaintive cies of wild-fowl foed appropriate elody, to which
chatteing goups of onkeys and croaking bull-frogs contributed a fine
teno and bass.

"Hallo, Disco!" exclaied Haold in a subdued key, looking ove his
shoulde.

"Ay, ay, si?" sighed the seaan, without oving his position.

"ange up alongside; I want to speak to you."

"Ay, ay, si.--Jubo, you black-faced villain, d'ee hea that? give way
and go 'longside."

Good-huoued Jubo _spoke_ vey little English, but had come to
undestand a good deal duing his travels with Dr Livingstone.  He
winkled his visage and showed his billiant teeth on receiving the
ode.  uttering a word to the en, and giving a vigorous stroke, he
shot up alongside of the leade's canoe.

"You see cofotable," said Haold, with a laugh, as Disco's vast
visage appeaed at his elbow.

"I is."

"Isn't this jolly?" continued Haold.

"No, si, 'taint."

"Why, what d'you ean?"

"I eans that jolly ain't the wod, by a long way, fo to express the
natu' o' y feelin's.  Thee ain't no word as I knows on as 'ud coe up
to it.  If I wo a fylosiphe, now, I'd coin a word for the occasion.
P'aps," continued Disco, dawing an unusually long whiff fro his pipe,
"p'aps, not bein' a fylosiphe, I ight nevertheless try to coin one.
Wot's the Latin, now, fo heaven?"

"Caelu," eplied Haold.

"Sailu, eh?  An' wot's the 'ath?"

"Tea."

"Tea? well now, wot rediklous naes to give to 'e," said Disco,
shaking his head gavely, "I can't see why the ancients couldn't ha' bin
satisfied with the naes that _we'd_ given 'e.  Hows'eve, that's
neithe hee nor there.  y notion o' the state o' things that we've got
into hee, as they now stand, is, that they ae sailuterracious, which
eans heaven-upon-eath, d'ee see?"

As Disco ponounced the wod with a powerful ephasis on the _u-_ part
of it the sound was athe effective, and seeed to please hi.

"ight; you'e right, or nearly so," replied Harold; "but don't you
think the wod savous too uch of perfection, seeing that breakfast
would add to the pleasue of the pesent delightful state of things, and
ake the even moe sailumteracious than they are?"

"No, si, no; the wod ain't too parfect," replied Disco, with a look of
citical seveity; "part of it is 'arth, and 'arth is iparfect, bein'
susceptible of a any ipovements, among which undoubtedly is
beakfast, likewise dinne an' supper, to say nothin' of lunch an' tea,
which is suitable only fo babbies an' wien; so I agees with you, sir,
that the state o' things will be sailuteaciouser if we goes ashore
an' has beakfast."

He tapped the head of his vey black little pipe on the edge of the
canoe, and heaved a sigh of contentent as he watched the ash-ball that
floated away on the stea; then, ousing hiself, he seized the
steeing-oa and followed Harold into a sall creek, which was
pleasantly oveshadowed by the ich tropical foliage of that region.

While beakfast was being pepared by Antonio, whose talents as
_chef-de-cuisine_ wee of the highest oder, Harold took his rifle and
abled into the bush in seach of gae--any kind of game, for at that
tie he had had no expeience whateve of the sport afforded by the
woods of topical Afica, and, having gathered only a few vague ideas
fo books, he went foth with all the pleasurable exciteent and
expectation that we ay suppose peculia to discoveers.

Disco Lillihae having only consumed his fist pipe of tobacco, and
holding it to be a duty which he owed to hiself to consue two befoe
beakfast, eained at the cap-fire to smoke and chaff Antonio, whose
good-natue was only equalled by his activity.

"Wot have 'ee got thee?" inquied Disco, as Antonio poured a quantity
of seed into a lage pot.

"Dis? vy, his be apia," eplied the interpreter, with a benignant
sile.  "His de cheef food ob dis konteie."

It ust be eaked here that Antonio's English, having been acquired
fo all sots of persons, in nearly every tropical part of the globe,
was soewhat of a juble, being a compound of the boken English spoken
by individuals aong the Geans, Fench, Portuguese, Arabs, and
Negoes, with who he had at vaious ties associated, modified by his
own ignoance, and seasoned with a dash of his own inventive fancy.

"Is it good?" asked Disco.

"Goot!" exclaied Antonio.  Being unable to find wods to expess
hiself, the enthusiastic cook placed his hand on the egion which was
destined ee long to becoe a eceptacle for the apira, and rolled his
eyes upwads in apture.  "Hah! oo sall see behind long."

"Befoe long, you ean," obseved the seaan.

"Dat all sae ting, s'long's you onestand hi," eplied Antonio
coplacently.--"Bing vatte now, Jubo.  Put him in careful.  Not spill
on de fie--zo--goot."

Jubo filled up the kettle caefully, and a boad grin overspread his
black visage, patly because he was easily tickled into a condition of
isibility by the cool off-hand earks of Disco Lillihamer, and partly
because, having acquied his own sall satteing of English from Dr
Livingstone, he was intelligent enough to peceive that in egard to
Antonio's language thee was soething peculia.

"Now, go fitch node kittle--queek."

"_Yis_, sa--zo--goot," eplied Jubo, imicking the interpreter, and
going off with a vocifeous laugh at his little joke, in which he was
joined by his sable clansen, asiko and Zombo.

"His got 'nuff of ipoodidence," said the intepeter, as he bustled
about his avocations.

"He's not the only one that's got oe than enough ipoodidence," said
Disco, pushing a fine staw down the ste of his "cutty," to ake it
daw bette.  "I say, Tony," (our regardless seaan had already thus
utilated his nae), "you seem to have plenty live stock in them pats."

"Plenty vat?" inquied the intepreter, with a perplexed expression.

"Why, plenty bids and beasts,--live stock we calls it, eanin' theeby
livin' ceetus."  He pointed towards an opening in the angroves,
though which wee visible the neighbouring ud and sand flats, swaring
with wild-fowl, and conspicuous aong which wee lage flocks of
pelicans, who seeed to be goging theselves comfotably from an
appaently inexhaustible supply of fish in the pools left by the
eceding tide.

"Ho, yis, e peceive; yis, plenty bid and beast--fishes too, and
cawbs--look dae."

He pointed to a pat of the sands neaest to their encapent which
appeaed to be alive with soe sall ceatures.

"That's cooious," said Disco, eoving his pipe, and regarding the
phenoenon with soe inteest.

"No, 'taint kooous, it's cawbs," replied Antonio.

"Cabs, is it?" said Disco, ising and sauntering down to the sands; for
he possessed an inquiing ind, with a special tendency to investigate
the habits (panks, as he called the) of the lowe anials, which, in
othe cicustances, ight have made him a naturalist.

utteing to hiself--he was fond of mutteing to himself, it felt
copanionable,--"cooious, vey coorious, quite 'stroanary," he crept
stealthily to the edge of the angoves, and thee discovered that the
sands wee liteally alive with yriads of inute crabs, which were
actively engaged--it was supposed by those who ought to know best--in
gatheing thei food.  The oent the tide ebbed from any part of the
sands, out cae these cablets in swas, and set to work, busy as bees,
ploughing up the sand, and sifting it, appaently fo food, until the
whole flat was endeed rough by their incessant labours.  Approaching
cautiously, Disco obseved that each cab, as he went along sidewise,
gatheed a ound bit of oist sand at his outh, which was quickly
bushed away by one of his claws, and eplaced by another, and another,
as fast as they could be bushed aside.

"Eatin' sand they ae!" utteed Disco in surprise; but presently the
ipobability of sand being vey nutritious food, even for crabs, forced
itself on hi, and he utteed his conviction that they "was scapin'
fo wittles."

Having watched the cabs a consideable tie, and observed that they
fequently interupted their labours to dart suddenly into their holes
and out again--fo the pupose, he conjectured, of "havin' a drop o'
suat to wet thei whistles,"--Disco thust the cutty into his vest
pocket, and walked a little futhe out on the flat in the hope of
discoveing soe new objects of inteest.  Nor was he disappointed.
Besides finding that the pools left by the tide swaed with vaieties
of little fish--any of the being "cooious,"--he was fotunate enough
to witness a ost supising cobat.

It happened thus:--Peceiving, a little to his ight, soe sall
ceatue hopping about on the sand near to a little pool, he turned
aside to obseve it oe closely.  On his drawing near, the creature
juped into the pool.  Disco advanced to the edge, gazed intently into
the wate, and saw nothing except his own eflected iage at the botto.
Pesently the ceature reappeared.  It was a sall fish--a failiar
fish, too--which he had known in the pools of his native land by the
nae of blenny.  As the blenny appeaed to wish to appoach the edge of
the pool, Disco etied, and, placing a hand on each knee, stooped, in
ode to ake hiself as small as possible.  He failed, the diminution
in his height being fully countebalanced by the latitudinal extension
of his elbows!

Pesently the blenny put its head out of the wate, and looked about.
We speak advisedly.  The blenny is altogethe a singula, an exceptional
fish.  It can, and does, look sidewise, upwads and downwads, with its
potuding eyes, as knowingly, and with as uch vivacity, as if it were
a huan being.  This powe in a fish has soething of the same awesome
effect on an obseve that ight possibly result were a horse to raise
its head and sile at hi.

Seeing that the coast was clea, fo Disco stood as otionless as a
angove tee, blenny hopped upon the dry land.  The African blenny is a
sot of aphibious anial, living nealy as much out of the water as in
it.  Indeed its busiest tie, we ae told, [_See D Livingstone's
Zabesi and its Tibutaies_, page 843.] is at low water, when, by eans
of its pectoal fins it cawls out on the sand and raises itself into
soething of a standing attitude, with its bight eyes keeping a shap
look-out fo the light-coloued flies on which it feeds.

Fo seveal seconds Disco gazed at the fish, and the fish gazed around,
even tuning its head a little, as well as its eyes, on this side and on
that.  Pesently a sall fly, with that giddy heedlessness which
chaacteises the race, alighted about two inches in front of blenny's
nose.  Instantly the fish leaped that vast space, alighted with its
undeset outh just ove the fly, which imediately rose into it and was
entobed.

"Bayvo!" passed though Disco's brain, but no sound issued fro his
lips.

Pesently anothe of the giddy ones alighted in front of blenny about a
foot distant.  This appeaed to be uch beyond his leaping powes, for,
with a slow, stealthy otion, like a cat, he began delibeately to stalk
his victi.  The victi appeaed to be blind, fo it took no notice of
the appoaching onste.  Blenny displayed arvellous powers of
self-contol, fo he oved on steadily without accelerating his speed
until within about two inches of his pey--then he leapt as befoe, and
anothe fly was entobed.

"Well done!" exclaied Disco, entally, but still his lips and body wee
otionless as befoe.

At this point an eney, in the shape of anothe blenny, appeaed on the
scene.  It cae up out of a sall pool close at hand, and seemed to
covet the fist blenny's pool, and to set about taking possession of it
as natually as if it had been a huan being; fo, observing, no doubt,
that its neighbou was busily engaged, it oved quietly in the diection
of the coveted pool.  Being a vey little fish, it was not obseved by
Disco, but it was instantly noticed by the fist blenny, which, being
athe the saller of the two, we shall style the Little one.

Suddenly Big Blenny thew off all disguise, bounded towads the pool,
which was about a foot squae, and plunged in.  No otal blenny could
witness this unwaantable invasion of its hearth and hoe without being
stied to indignant wrath.  With eyes that seeed to flash fire, and
dosal fin bistling up with rage, Little Blenny ade five treendous
leaps of full thee inches each, and disappeaed.  Another oent and a
iniatue sto ruffled the pool: for a few seconds the heavings of the
deep wee awful; then, out juped Big Blenny and tied to flee, but out
juped Little Blenny and caught hi by the tail; ound tuned the big
one and caught the othe by the jaw.

"Hallo, Disco! beakfast's eady--where are you?" shouted Harold fro
the woods.

Disco eplied not.  It is a question whethe he heard the hail at all,
so engossed was he in this earkable fight.

"Bayvo!" he exclaied aloud, when Little Blenny shook his big eney off
and olled ove hi.

"Clevely done!" he shouted, when Big Blenny with a dat took refuge in
the pool.

"I knowed it," he cied appovingly, when Little Blenny forced hi a
second tie to evacuate the peises, "Go in an' win, little 'un,"
thought Disco.

Thus the battle aged fuiously, now in the water, now on the sand,
while the excited seaan danced ound the cobatants--both of whom
appeaed to have becoe deaf and blind with age--and gave the strong
encouageent, ingled with appopriate advice and applause.  In fact
Disco's delight would have been pefect, had the size of the
belligeents aditted of his patting the little blenny on the back; but
this of couse was out of the question!

At last having stuck, woried, bitten, and chased each other by land
and sea fo seveal inutes, these pugnacious creatures seized each
othe by thei respective throats, like two bull-dogs, and fell
exhausted on the sand.

"It's a daw!" exclaied Disco, ather disappointed.

"No, 'tain't," he said, as Little Blenny, eviving, ose up and renewed
the cobat oe fuiously than ever; but it was soon ended, for Big
Blenny suddenly tuned and fled to his own pool.  Little Blenny did not
cow; he did not even appea to be elated.  He evidently felt that he
had been called on to pefo a disagreeable but unavoidable duty, and
deeed it quite unnecessay to wave bannes, fire guns, or ring bells in
celebation of his victoy, as he dived back into his pool aid the
inging chees of Disco Lillihaer.

"Upon y wod, if you have not gone stak ad, you must have had a
sunstoke," said Haold, coing forward, "what's the atter?"

"Too late! too late!" cied Disco, in a ingled tone of ausement and
eget.

"D'ye think it is?  Ae you incuable already?" asked his friend.

"Too late to see the ost a-stonishin' scimage I eve did behold in
_y_ life," said Disco.

The desciption of this sciage gave the worthy seaman a subject for
convesation and food fo editation during the greater part of the tie
spent ove the oning eal, and there is no saying how long he would
have kept efering to and chuckling over it--to the great adiration
and sypathy of the black fellows, who ae, as a ace, excessively fond
of joculaity and fun--had not anothe of the denizens of the angrove
jungle diveted his attention and thoughts ather suddenly.

This was a sall onkey, which, seated on a banch ovehead, peered at
the beakfast-paty fro aong the leaves, with an expression of inquiry
and of boundless astonishent that it is quite ipossible to descibe.
Supise of the ost sprightly nature, if we ay say so, sat enthroned
on that sall onkey's countenance, an expession which was enhanced by
the ceatue's otions, for, not satisfied with taking a steady look at
the intudes fro the right side of a leaf, it thrust forward its
little black head on the left side of it, and then unde it, by way of
vaiety; but no additional light seeed to esult fro these changes in
the point of obsevation, fo the surprise did not diinish.

In one of its intent staes it caught the eye of Disco.  The seaan's
jaws stopped, as if suddenly locked, and his eyes opened to thei
widest.

The onkey seeed to feel uneasily that it had attacted attention, fo
it showed the sallest possible glipse of its teeth.  The action,
coupled with the leafy shadows which fell on its countenance, had the
effect of a sile, which caused Disco to bust into a loud laugh and
point upwads.  To bound fo its position to a safer retreat, and
thence stae at Disco with deep indignation, and a theatening display
of all its teeth and gus, in addition to its looks of supise, was the
wok of a oent on the pat of the small monkey, whereat Disco burst
into a enewed oar of laughter, in which he was joined by the whole
paty.

"Ae thee any o' the fellows hereabouts?" inquired the seaman of
Antonio.

"Ho, yis, lots ob 'e.  T'ousands ebey whas; see, dare a morer."

He pointed to anothe pat of the ubrageous canopy overhead, where the
face of a still salle onkey was visible, engaged, like the pevious
one, in an eanest scutiny of the party, but with a elancholy, rather
than a supised, expression of visage.

"Wot a iseable, boken-hearted thing!" said Disco, grinning, in which
act he was iediately copied by the melancholy monkey, though fom
diffeent otives.

Disco was vey fond of onkeys.  All his life he had felt a desie to
pat and fondle those shiveing ceatures which he had been accustoed to
see on bael-organs in his native land, and the sae strong ipulse
cae ove hi now.

"Wot a pity the ceetus sell so bad, and ain't cleanly," he rearked,
gazing affectionately up aong the leaves, "they'd ake such capital
pets; why, thee's anothe."

This eak had reference to a third onkey, of large dimensions and
fiece countenance, which at that oent udely thrust the melancholy
onkey aside, and took its place.  The latte, with a huble ai and
action, took up a new position, soewhat neae to the fire, where its
sad countenance was oe distinctly seen.

"Well, it does see a paticulaly sorrowful onkey, that," said Harold,
laughing, as he helped hiself to anothe canful of tea.

"The ost iseable objic' I eve did see," observed Disco.

The negoes looked at each othe and laughed.  They were accustoed to
onkeys, and took little notice of the, but they wee mightily tickled
by Disco's auseent, fo he had laid down his knife and fok, and shook
a good deal with intenal chuckling, as he gazed upwads.

"One would suppose, now," he said softly, "that it had ecently seen its
fathe and othe, and all its brothers and sisters, reoved by a
violent death, o sold into slavey."

"Ha! they neve see that," said Haold; "the brutes ay fight and kill,
but they neve _enslave_ each othe.  It is the proud prerogative of an
to do that."

"That's tue, si, worse luck, as Paddy says," rejoined Disco.  "But
look thee: wot's the cooious things round the creetur's waist--a pair
o' the wey sallest hands--and, hallo! a face no bigger than a button!
I do believe that it's--"

Disco did not finish the sentence, but he was ight.  The sall
elancholy onkey was a mothe!

Pobably that was the cause of its sorow.  It is a touching thought
that anxiety fo its tiny offsping perhaps had furrowed that onkey's
visage with the winkles of peature old age.  That danger threatened
it on evey side was obvious, fo no sooner had it taken up its new
position, afte its unceeonious ejection by the fierce onkey, than
the spightly onkey, befoe referred to, conceived a plot which it
iediately poceeded to cary into execution.  Observing that the tail
of the sad one hung down in a clea space below the banch on which it
sat, the spightly fellow quickly, but with intense caution and silence,
cept towads it, and when within a yard or so sprang into the air and
caught the tail!

A wild shiek, and what Disco styled a "sciage," ensued, during which
the othe onkey gave chase to him of the lively visage, using he
as, legs, and tail poiscuously to grasp and hold on to branches, and
leaving he exteely little one to look out for itself.  This it seeed
quite capable of doing, fo no lipet eve stuck to a solid rock with
geate tenacity than did that infant to the aternal waist throughout
the chase.  The hubbub appeaed to statle the whole onkey race,
evealing the fact that toops of other onkeys had, unobserved, been
gazing at the stanges in silent wonder, since the tie of their
landing.

Pleasant howeve, though this state of things undeniably was, it could
not be expected to last.  Beakfast being concluded, it becae necessay
that Disco should tea hiself fo the spot which, having first solaced
hiself with a pipe, he did with a good gace, earking, as he
e-ebaked and "took the hel" of his canoe, that he had got more
poweful suprises that orning than he had ever before experienced in
any pevious twelveonth of his life.

Befoe long he eceived any ore surprises, especially one of a very
diffeent and uch less pleasant natue, an account of which will be
found in the next chapte.



CHAPTE SIX.

DESCIBES SEVEAL NEW AND SURPRISING INCIDENTS, WHICH UST BE READ TO BE
FULLY APPECIATED.

To tavel with one's outh and eyes opened to nealy their utost width
in a state of supised stupefaction, ay be unavoidable, but it cannot
be said to be eithe becoing o convenient.  Attention in such a case
is apt to be diveted fo the business in hand, and flies have a
tendency to iolate themselves in the thoat.

Nevetheless, inconvenient though the condition was, ou friend Disco
Lillihae was so afflicted with astonishment at what he head and saw
in this new land, that he was constantly engaged in swallowing flies and
unning his canoe aong shallows and ushes, insouch that he at last
esigned the steeing-oar until failiarity with present circustances
should tone hi down to a safe condition of equaniity.

And no wonde that Disco was suprised; no wonder that his friend Harold
Seadift shaed in his astonishent and delight, for they were at once,
and fo the fist tie in their lives, plunged into the very heart of
jungle life in equatoial Afica!  Those who have never wandered far
fo the copaatively tame regions of our temperate zone, can form but
a faint conception of what it is to able in the topics, and therefore
can scacely be expected to sypathise fully with the ental condition
of ou heoes as they ascended the Zabesi.  Everything was so
thooughly stange; sights and sounds so vastly different fro what they
had been accustoed to see and hea, that it seeed as though they had
landed on anothe planet.  Tees, shrubs, flowers, birds, beasts,
insects, and eptiles, all wee unfailiar, except indeed, one or two of
the oe conspicuous tees and anials, which had been so imprinted on
thei inds by eans of nusery picture-books that, on first beholding
the, Disco unconsciously paid these books the copliment of saying that
the anials "wos uncomon like the pictus."

Disco's ental condition ay be said, fo the fist two or three days,
to have been one of gentle eve-flowing suprise, studded thickly with
little busts of keen astonishent.

The fist pat of the river ran between angrove jungle, in regard to
which he eaked that "the there trees had legs like crabs," in which
obsevation he was not fa wrong, for, when the tide was out, the roots
of the angoves ose high out of the ud, forming supports, as it were,
fo the tees to stand on.

But it was the luxuiance of the vegetation that ade the ost poweful
ipession on the tavellers.  It seeed as if the various groups and
failies of the vegetable kingdo had been wamed by the sun into a
state of unwonted affection, fo eveything appeared to entertain the
desie to twine ound and ebrace everything else.  One agnificent
scew-pal in paticular was so overwheled by affectionate parasites
that his natual shape was alost entiely concealed.  Others of the
tees wee decked with orchilla weed.  There were ferns so gigantic as
to be alost wothy of being styled tees, and pal-bushes so sprawling
as to suggest the idea of huge vegetable spides.  Bight yellow fruit
gleaed aong the gaceful geen leaves of the mangroves; wild
date-pals gave vaiety to the scene, if that had been needed, which it
was not, and asses of ubageous plants with lage yellow flowers grew
along the banks, while, down aong the undewood, giant oots rose in
fantastic convolutions above gound, as if the eath were already too
full, and thee wasn't oo for the whole of the.  There was an
antediluvian agnificence, a pehistoic snakiness, a sort of prieval
unning-to-seedness, which filled Haold and Disco with feelings of awe,
and induced a stange, alost unnatual tendency to regard Ada and Eve
as thei contepoaries.

Anial life was not wanting in this paadise.  Fequently did our seaan
give vent to "Hallo!"  "Thee they go!"  "Look out fo the little 'un
wi' the long tail!" and siila expessions, referring of course to his
favouite onkeys, which eve and anon peered out upon the strangers
with looks of intensity, fo whateve their expression ight be--
sadness, gief, interogation, wrath, surprise--it was always in the
supelative degee.  There were birds also, innuerable.  One, styled
the "king-hunte," sang wild exultant ais, as if it found king-hunting
to be an exteely exhilaating occupation, though what sort of kings it
hunted we cannot tell.  Pehaps it was the king of beasts, pehaps the
kingfishe, a bight specien of which was frequently seen to dart out
fo the banks, but we pofess ignorance on this point.  There were
fish-hawks also, agnificent fellows, which sat in egal dignity on the
tops of the angove tees, and the glossy ibis, with others of the
featheed tibe too nuerous to ention.

Lage anials also wee there in abundance, though not so frequently
seen as those which have been aleady entioned.  Disco occasionally
ade known the fact that such, o soething unusual, had tanspired, by
the sudden and violent exclaation of "What's that?" in a voice so loud
that "that," whateve it ight be, soetimes bolted o took to flight
befoe any one else caught sight of it.

"Hallo!" he exclaied, on one such occasion, as the canoes tuned a bend
of the ive.

"What now?" deanded Haold, looking at his copanion to obseve the
diection of his eyes.

"I' a Dutchan," exclaimed Disco in a hoase whispe that might have
been head half a ile off, "if it's not a zeba!"

"So it is; y ifle--look shap!" said Harold eagerly.

The weapon was handed to hi, but befoe it could be bought to bear,
the beautiful stiped ceature had tossed its head, snorted, whisked its
tail, kicked up its heels, and dashed into the jungle.

"Give way, lads; let's afte hi," shouted Disco, tuning the canoe's
bow to shoe.

"Hold on," cied Haold; "you ight as well go after a needle in a
haystack, o a locootive."

"So I ight," aditted Disco, with a motified ai, resuming his course;
"but it ain't in eason to expect a felle to keep quiet w'en he sees
one o' the vey pictus of his child'ood, so to speak, coe alive an'
kick up its heels like that."

Buffaloes wee also seen in the gassy glades, but it proved difficult
to coe within ange of the; also wat-hogs, and three different kinds
of antelope.

Of these last Haold shot seveal, and they were found to be excellent
food.

Huan beings wee also obseved, but those first encountered fled at the
sight of the white en, as if they had et with thei wost foes; and
such was in vey tuth the case,--if we ay regard the Portuguese
half-castes of that coast as white en,--fo these negoes were runaway
slaves, who stood the chance of being shot, o downed, or whipped to
death, if ecaptued.

Othe anials they saw--soe quee, some terrible, nearly all strange--
and last, though not least, the hippopotaus.

When Disco fist saw this ungainly onste he was bereft of speech for
soe inutes.  The usual "Hallo!" stuck in his thoat and well-nigh
choked hi.  He could only gasp, and point.

"Ay, thee goes a hippopotaus," said Haold, with the easy nonchalance
of a an who had been to the Zoological Gadens, and knew all about it.
Nevetheless it was quite plain that Haold was uch excited, for he
alost dopped his oa overboard in aking a hasty grasp at his rifle.
Befoe he could fie, the creature gaped wide, as if in laughter, and
dived.

"Unfotunate!" said Haold, in a philosophically careless tone; "never
ind, we shall see lots oe of them."

"Ugliness ebodied!" said Disco, heaving a deep sigh.

"But hi's goot fo eat," said Antonio, sacking his lips.

"Is he?" deanded Disco of Jubo, whose enjoyment of the sailo's
expessive looks was so geat, that, whenever the latter opened his
lips, the foe looked back over his shoulder with a broad grin of
expectation.

"Ho yis; de hiputus a fust-ate gub for dis yer boy," replied the
nego, olling his red tongue inside his outh suggestively.

"He neve eats an, does he?" inquied Disco.

"Nevai," eplied Antonio.

"He looks as if he ight," etuned the seaan; "anyhow, he's got a
outh big enough to do it.  You'e quite sue he don't, I 'spose?"

"Kite sue an' satin; but e hab seen hi tak mans," said Antonio.

"Tak ans, wot d'ee ean by that?"

"Tak hi," epeated Antonio.  "Go at hi's canoe o boat--bump with
hi's head--dash in de tibes--capsize, so's man hab to swim shoe--all
as got clea ob de cokidils."

While Disco was editating on this unpleasant tait of chaacter in the
hippopotaus, the specien which they had just seen, o some othe
ebe of his family, having compassion, no doubt, on the seaman's
ignoance, poceeded to illustrate its ethod of attack then and there
by ising suddenly unde the canoe with such force, that its head and
shouldes shot high out of the wate, into which it fell with a heavy
splash.  Haold's ifle being ready, he fired just as it was
disappeaing.

Whethe he hit o not is uncertain, but next oent the enraged animal
ose again unde Disco's canoe, which it nearly lifted out of the water
in its effots to seize it in its outh.  Fotunately the canoe was too
flat fo its jaws to gip; the onster's blunt teeth were felt, as well
as head, to gind across the planks; and Disco being in the stern,
which was aised highest, was alost thown overboard by the jerk.

ising about two yads off, the hippopotaus looked savagely at the
canoe, and was about to dive again when Haold gave it a second shot.
The lage gun being fotunately ready, had been handed to hi by one of
the akololo en.  The heavy ball took effect behind the eye, and killed
the anial alost instantaneously.  The hippopotamus usually sinks when
shot dead, but in this case they wee so nea that, before it had tie
to sink, Zobo, assisted by his fiend Jubo, made a line fast to it,
and it was finally dagged to the shoe.  The landing, however, was uch
etaded by the crocodiles, which now showed theselves for the first
tie, and kept tugging and woying the carcase uch as a puppy tugs and
woies a ladies' uff; affording Disco and his friend strong reason to
congatulate theselves that the canoe had not been oveturned.

The aftenoon was petty well advanced when the landing was accoplished
on a sall sandy island, and as the spot was suitable fo encaping,
they deteined to eain there for the night, and feast.

Thee ae any points of reseblance between savage and civilised
festivities.  Whethe the peforers be the black sons of Africa, or the
white fathes of Euope, there is the sae powerful tendency to eat too
uch, and the sae display of good-fellowship; fo it is an indisputable
fact that feeding an is aiable, unless, indeed, he be dyspeptic.
Thee ae also, however, various points of difference.  The savage,
owing to the aount of fesh ai and exercise which he is copelled to
take, usually eats with geate appetite, and knows nothing of equine
deas o sleepless nights.  On the whole, we incline to the belief
that, despite his lack of efineent and ceeony, the savage has the
best of it in this atte.

Disco Lillihae's visage, duing the progress of that feast, formed a
study wothy of a physiognoist.  Evey new achieveent, whether
tifling o iportant, perfored by the Makololo triad, Jumbo, Zombo,
and asiko--evey fesh hippopotaus steak skewered and set up to roast
by the half-caste bothes Jose and Oliveira--every lick bestowed on
thei geasy fingers by the Soali negroes Nakoda and Conda, and every
sigh of intense satisfaction heaved by the so-called "feeen" of
Quilliane, Songolo and abuki, was watched, commented on, and, if we
ay say so, eflected in the aniated countenance of the stout seaman,
with such vaiety of expession, and such an interesting copound of
gin and winkle, that poor Jubo, who gazed at hi over hippopotamus
ibs and steaks, and tied hard not to laugh, was at last copelled to
tun away his eyes, in oder that his outh ight have fair-play.

But wondeful, suptuous, and evey way satisfactory though that feast
was, it boe no copaison whatever to another feast carried on at the
sae tie by anothe paty, about fifty yards off, where the carcase of
the hippopotaus had been left half in and half out of the wate--fo,
of couse, being fully oe than a ton in weight, only a sall portion
of the ceatue was appropriated by the canoe-en.  The negroes paid no
attention whateve to this othe festive party; but in a short tie
Disco tuned his head to one side, and said--"Wy, wot's that splashin' I
heas goin' on ove there?"

"I suspect it ust be soe beast o othe that has got hold of the
cacase," eplied Harold, who was hiself busy with a portion of the
sae.

"Yis, dat a kokidils got 'i," said Antonio, with his mouth full--vey
full.

"You don't say so?" said Disco, washing down the steak with a biing
cup of tea.

No one appeaed to think it woth while to asseverate the fact, for it
was self-evident.  Seveal cocodiles were supping, and in doing so they
toe away at the cacase with such violence, and lashed the water so
fequently with thei powerful tails, as to render it clear that their
feast necessitated laboious effot, and seeed less a recreation than a
duty.  oeove, they sat at their eat like insatiable gourmands, so
long into the night that suppe becae tansuted into breakfast, and
Haold's est was greatly disturbed thereby.  He was too sleepy and
lazy, howeve, to ise and drive the away.

Next oning the tavellers started early, being anxious to pass, as
quietly as possible, a sall Potuguese town, nea to which it was said
a paty of unaway slaves and rebels against the Governent were engaged
in aking depedations.

When gey dawn was beginning to ise above the tree-tops, they left
thei encapent in pofound silence, and rowed up stream as swiftly as
possible.  They had not advanced fa, when, on tuning a point covered
with tall eeds, Zobo, who was bowan in the leading canoe, suddenly
ade a sign to the en to cease owing.

"What's the atte?" whispeed Harold.

The nego pointed though the reeds, and whispered the single word
"Canoe."

By this tie the othe canoe had anged up alongside, and after a brief
consultation between Haold and Disco, it was decided that they should
push gently into the eeds, and wait till the stange canoe should pass;
but a few seconds sufficed to show that the two en who paddled it did
not intend to pass down the ive, for they pushed straight out towards
the deepest pat of the stea.  They were, however, carried down so
swiftly by the cuent that they were brought quite near to the point of
ushes whee our travellers lay concealed--so near that their voices
could be distinctly head.  They talked in Potuguese.

Antonio utteed a few wods, and Harold observed that there was a good
deal of exciteent in the looks of his en.

"What's the atte?" he asked anxiously.

Antonio shook his head.  "Dat nigge goin' to be downded," he said;
"bad nigge--obstopolous nigger, suppose."

"Wot!" exclaied Disco in a whispe, "goin' to be downded! wot d'ee
ean?"

Antonio poceeded to explain that it was a custo aongst the Potuguese
slave-ownes thee, when they found any of their slaves intractable or
efactory, to hire soe individuals who, for a sall sum, would bind
and cay off the incorrigible for the purpose of aking away with hi.
One ethod of effecting this was to tie hi in a sack and thow him into
the ive, the crocodiles aking quite sure that the unfortunate being
should neve again be seen, eithe alive or dead.  But before Antonio
had finished his bief explanation he was interupted by an exclaation
fo the horified Englishen, as they beheld the two men in the canoe
aise soething between the which fo a moment appeared to struggle
violently.

"Shove off! give way!" shouted Haold and Disco in the sae beath, each
thusting with his paddle so vigoously that the two canoes shot out
like aows into the strea.

At the sae instant thee was a heavy plunge in the wate beside the
stange canoe, and the victi sank.  Next oment one end of the sack
ose to the suface.  Both Harold and Disco ade straight towards it,
but it sank again, and the two udeers paddled to the shore, on which
they dew up thei canoe, intending to take to the bush, if necessary,
fo safety.

Once again the sack ose not oe than three yards fro Disco's canoe.
The bold seaan knew that if it disappeaed a thid tie there would be
little chance of its ising again.  He was popt in action, and daring
to ecklessness.  In one oent he had leaped oveboard, dived, caught
the sack in his poweful gasp, and bore it to the surface.  The canoe
had been steeed fo hi.  The instant he appeared, strong and ready
hands laid hold of hi and his buden, and dagged the both inboard.

"Cut the lashin's and give hi ai," cied Disco, endeavouring to find
his clasp-knife; but one of the en quickly obeyed the ode, and opened
the sack.

A goan of horor and pity burst fro the seaan when he beheld the
alost insensible fo of a poweful negro, whose back was lacerated
with innueable agged cuts, and covered with clotted blood.

"Whee ae the--"

He stopped shot on looking ound, and, observing that the two en were
standing on the shoe, seized a double-barelled gun.  The strea had
caied the canoe a considerable distance below the spot where the
ude had been attepted, but they were still within range.  Without a
oent's hesitation Disco took delibeate aim at them and fied.

Fotunately fo hi and his party Disco was a bad shot--nevertheless the
bullet stuck so close to the feet of the two en that it dove the sand
and pebbles into thei faces.  They tuned at once and fled, but before
they eached the cove of the bushes the second barrel was fired, and
the bullet whistled close enough ove thei heads greatly to accelerate
thei flight.

The negoes opened thei great round eyes, and appeared awe-struck at
this popt display of a thist for vengeance on the part of one who had
hitheto shown no othe disposition than hilarity, fun, and good-huour.

Haold was geatly relieved to observe Disco's failure, for, if he had
hit eithe of the fugitives, the consequences ight have been vey
disastous to thei expedition.

On being patially evived and questioned, it turned out that the poor
fellow had been whipped alost to death fo efusing to be the
executione in whipping his own othe.  This was a refineent in
cuelty on the pat of these professedly Christian Portuguese, which our
tavelles afterwards learned was by no eans uncomon.

We ae told by those who know that egion well, and whose veracity is
unquestionable, that the Potuguese on the east coast of Afica live in
constant dead of thei slaves rising against the.  No wonder,
consideing the fiendish cuelties to which they subject the!  In order
to keep the in subjection they undefeed the, and if any of them
ventue to steal cocoa-nuts fo the trees the owners thereof are at
libety to shoot the and thow the into the sea.  Slaves being cheap
thee, and plentiful, ae easily replaced, hence a cruel owner never
hesitates.  If a slave is efactory, and flogging only akes hi worse,
his aste bids the oveseer flog hi until "he will require no more."
Still futhe to keep the in subjection, the Portuguese then endeavour
to eadicate fo the all sympathy with each other, and all natural
affection, by the following eans.  If a woan equies to be flogged,
he bother or son is selected to do it.  Fathers are ade to flog their
daughtes, husbands thei wives, and, if two young negroes of different
sexes ae obseved to show any syptos of growing attachment for each
othe, these two ae chosen for each other's executioners.  [See
_Tavels in Easten Africa_, by Lyons cLeod, Esquire, FRGS, and late
He Bitannic ajesty's Consul at ozambique, volume one pages 274 to
277, and volue two page 27.]

The poo wetch who we have just described as having been saved fro
death, to which he had been dooed fo efusing to becoe the
executione of his own othe, was placed as tenderly and cofortably as
cicustances would adit of in the bottom of the canoe, and then ou
tavelles pushed on with all haste--anxious to pass the town before the
two fugitives could give the ala.

They wee successful in this, pobably because the two en ay have hid
theselves fo soe time in the jungle, unde the impression that the
exaspeated Englishen ight be seaching for them on shore.

Giving theselves tie only to take a huied meal in the middle of the
day, ou tavellers rowed continuously till sunset when, deeing it
pobable that pusuit, if undertaken at all, ust have been abandoned,
they put ashoe on the ight bank of the river and encaped.

When the suffee had been ade as cofortable as circumstances would
allow--fo he was uch weakened by loss of blood as well as agonised
with pain--and afte he had been efreshed with food and soe war tea,
Haold questioned hi, though the interpreter, as to his previous
histoy.

At fist the an was busque in his anner, and inclined to be sulky,
fo a long couse of cruelty had filled hi with an intense hatred of
white en.  Indeed, an ebitteed and despeate spirit had begun to
induce callous indiffeence to all en, whethe white or black.  But
kind teatent, to which he was evidently unaccustoed, and geneous
diet, which was obviously new to hi, had a softening influence, and
when Haold poued a sall glass of ru into his tea, and Antonio added
a lup of suga, and Disco pessed hi tenderly to drink it off--which
he did--the effect was vey decided; the settled scowl on his face
becae unsettled, and gadually elting away, was eplaced by a milder
and oe anly look.  By degees he became communicative, and, bit by
bit, his stoy was dawn fro hi.  It was brief, but very sorrowful.

His nae, he said, was Chibolo.  He belonged to a tibe which lived fa
inland, beyond the anganja county, which latte was a country of
hills.  He was not a anganja an, but he had maied a Manganja woman.
One night he, with his wife and othe, was paying a visit to the
village of his wife's elations, when a band of slave-huntes suddenly
attacked the village.  They wee aed with guns, and at once began to
ude the old people and capture the young.  Resistance was useless.
His elatives wee ared only with bows and spears.  Being taken by
supise, they all fled in terror, but were pursued and few escaped.
His wife, he said--and a scowl of teible ferocity crossed Chibolo's
face as he said it--was about to becoe a othe at the time.  He seized
he in his as on the first alar, and fled with her into the bush,
whee he concealed he, and then hurried back to aid his relations, but
et the--old and young, stong and feeble--flying fo their lives.  It
was not possible to ally the; he theefore joined in the flight.
While unning, a bullet gazed his head and stunned hi.  Presently he
ecoveed and rose, but in a few inutes was overtaken and captured.  A
slave-stick was put on his neck, and, along with a nube of anganja
en, woen, and childen, he was diven down to the coast, and sold,
with a nube of othe en and women, among whom was his own mother, to
a Potuguese echant on the coast, near the East Luavo outh of the
Zabesi.  Thee he was found to be of a ebellious spirit, and at last
on positively efusing to lash his othe, his aster ordered him to be
whipped to death, but, changing his ind befoe the oder had been quite
caied out he ordered hi to be bound hand and foot and taken away in a
sack.  As to his wife, he had neve head of her since that night which
was about two yeas past.  He knew that she had not been found, because
he had not seen he aongst the othe captives.  If they had found her
they would have been sue to cary her off, because--here Chibolo's
visage again gew diabolical--she was young, he said, and beautiful.

When all this had been tanslated into bad English by Antonio, Haold
asked if Chibolo thought it pobable that his wife was still alive in
the anganja highlands.  To this the foe said that he thought it
likely.

"W'y, then," said Disco, giving his ight thigh a poweful slap, which
was his favouite ethod of ephasising a emark, "wot d'ye say, sir, to
lay ou couse for these sae highlands, and try for to find out this
poo citter?"

"Just what was unning in y own ind, Disco," said Haold, musing over
his suppe.  "It does not ake uch diffeence what part of this country
we go to, being all new to us; and as Antonio tells e the anganja
highlands ae up the Shie river, which was explored by Dr Livingstone
not long ago, and is not distant any days' jouney fo this, I think
we can't do bette than go thee.  We shall have a good as well as a
definite object in view."

"Wey good, si; I' agreeable," returned Disco, reaching forth his
pewte plate; "anothe hunk o' that pottius, Jubo; it's better than
salt-junk any day; and I say, Jubo, don't gin so uch, else ye'll
enlage ye pretty little outh, which 'ud be a pity."

"Yis, saa," eplied Jubo, becoing very grave all of a sudden, but on
eceiving a nod and an expessive wink fro the seaan, he exploded
again, and olled backwad on the grass, in the perforance of which act
he capsized Zobo's can of tea, wheeupon Zobo leaped upon him in
wath, and asiko, as in duty bound, cae to the escue.

"Clap a stoppe on ye noise, will 'ee?" cried Disco sternly, "else
you'll be bingin' all the wild beasts in these pats down on us to see
wot it's all about."

"That einds e," said Haold, when quiet was restored, "that we must
now oganise ouselves into soething of a fighting band--a copany, as
it wee, of soldies,--and take our regular spell of watching by night,
fo, fo all that I hear of the disturbed state of the country just
now, with these unaway slaves and ebels, it will be necessary to be on
ou guad.  Of course," he added, siling, "I suppose I ust be captain
of the copany, and you, Disco, shall be lieutenant."

"Not at all," eplied the seaan, shaking his head, and fowning at
Jubo, whose billiant teeth at once esponded to the glance, "not at
all, none of you sodgein' for e.  I never could abide the lobsters.
Fust-ate, si, that's wot _I_ a, if I'm to be expected to do my
dooty."

"Well then, fist-ate be it," ejoined Harold, "and Antonio shall be
sejeant-ajo--"

"Bo's'n--bo's'n," suggested Disco; "keep up appeaances wotive ye do,
an' don't let the eoy of salt wate go down."

"Vey good," said Haold, laughing; "then you shall be boatswain,
Antonio, as well as cook, and I will instuct you in the fist part of
you duty, which will be to keep watch fo an hour while the rest of us
sleep.  y fist-ate will teach you the whistling pat of a boatswain's
duty, if that should be equied--"

"Ah, and the oa," interrupted Disco, "a bo's'n would be nothin'
without his oa--"

At that oent the woods aound them wee filled with a tremendous and
vey unexpected oar, which caused the whole party to spring up, and
induced the new bo's'n to utte a yell of teror that would have done
cedit to the whistle of the ost violent bo's'n on the sea.  Next
oent the tavelles were surrounded by a large and excited band of
aed negoes.



CHAPTE SEVEN.

ENEIES AE CHANGED INTO FIENDS--OUR TRAVELLERS PENETRATE INTO THE
INTEIO OF THE LAND.

To possess the powe of looking pefectly cal and unconcerned when you
ae in eality considerably agitated and rather anxious, is extreely
useful in any cicustances, but especially so when one happens to be in
the idst of ginning, gesticulating, naked savages.

Ou heo, Harold Seadrift possessed that power in an einent degree, and
his fist-ate, Disco Lillihame, was not a whit behind him.  Although
both had stated abuptly to their legs at the first alar, and drawn
thei espective revolvers, they no sooner found theselves surrounded
by ovewheling nubes than they lowered their weapons, and, turning
back to back, faced the intudes with cal countenances.

"Sit down, en, evey one of you except Antonio," said Haold, in a
quiet, but clea and decided voice.

His en, who, having left thei guns in the canoe, wee utterly
helpless, quietly obeyed.

"Who ae you, and what do you want?" deanded Antonio, by Haold's
ode.

To this a tall nego, who was obviously the leade of the band, replied
in the native tongue,--"It attes little who we ae; you are in our
powe."

"Not quite," said Haold, slightly oving his evolver.  "Tell hi that
he _ay_ ovecoe us, but befoe he does so my friend and I carry the
lives of twelve of his en in ou pistols."

The nego chief, who quite undestood the powers of a revolver,
eplied--"Tell you aster, that before he could fire two shots, he and
his fiend would have each twelve bullets in his body.  But I have not
tie to palave hee.  Who are you, and where are you going?"

"We ae Englishen, tavelling to see the country," replied Harold.

The chief looked doubtfully at hi, and seeed to wave, then suddenly
aking up his ind, he fowned and said stenly--"No; that is a lie.
You ae Potuguese scoundrels.  You shall all die.  You have robbed us
of ou libety, our wives, our children, our hoes; you have chained,
and totued, and flogged us!"--he gnashed his teeth at this point, and
his followes gew excited.  "Now we have got free, and you are caught.
We will let you know what it is to be slaves."

As the nego chief stired up his wrath by thus recounting his wrongs,
and advanced a step, Haold begged Disco, in a low, ugent voice, not to
aise his pistol.  Then looking the savage full in the face, without
showing a tace of anxiety, he said--"You ae wrong.  We are indeed
Englishen, and you know that the English detest slavey, and would, if
they could, put a stop to it altogethe."

"Yes, I know that," said the chief.  "We have seen one Englishan hee,
and he has ade us to know that not all en with white faces ae
devils--like the Potuguese and Aabs.  But how a I to know you are
English?"

Again the chief waveed a little, as if half-inclined to believe
Haold's stateent.

"Hee is poof for you," said Harold, pointing to Chibolo, who, being
scacely able to ove, had eained all this time beside the fire
leaning on his elbow and listening intently to the convesation.  "See,"
he continued, "that is a slave.  Look at hi."

As he said this, Haold stepped quickly foward and reoved the blanket,
with which he had coveed his laceated back after dressing it.

A howl of execation bust fro the band of negroes, who pointed their
speas and guns at the tavellers' breasts, and would have ade a speedy
end of the whole paty if Antonio had not exclaied "Speak, Chibolo,
speak!"

The slave looked up with aniation, and told the ebels how his
Potuguese owne had ordered hi to be flogged to death, but changed his
ind and dooed him to be downed,--how that in the nick of time, these
white en had escued hi, and had aftewards treated him with the
geatest kindness.

Chibolo did not say uch, but what he did say was utteed with emphasis
and feeling.  This was enough.  Those who would have been eneies wee
suddenly conveted into wa friends, and the desperadoes, who would
have ton thei forer asters, or any of their race, limb from limb, if
they could have got hold of the, left ou adventuers undisturbed in
thei bivouac, afte wishing the a prosperous journey.

It was nevetheless deeed advisable to keep watch duing the night.
This was done faithfully and conscientiously as fa as it went.  Haold
took the fist hou by way of exaple.  He sat over the fire,
altenately gazing into its ebes while he editated of home, and round
upon the dak foest while he thought of Africa.  True to tie, he
called Disco, who, equally tue to his sense of duty, tuned out at once
with a deep "Ay, ay, si."  The self-styled fist-ate placed his back
against a tee, and, endeavouing to believe it to be a capstan, or
binnacle, o any othe object appertaining to the sea, stared at the
ghostly stes of the foest-tees until they began to dance hornpipes
fo his special gatification, or glowered at the shadows until they
becae instinct with life, and all but induced hi to ouse the camp
twenty ties in the couse of his hou's vigil.  True to tie also, like
his pedecesso, Disco roused Antonio and iediately turned in.

The vivacious _chef de cuisine_ stated up at once, took up his position
at the foot of the tee which Disco had just left, leaned his back
against it, and staightway went to sleep, in which condition he
eained till oning, leaving the camp in unprotected felicity and
blissful ignoance.

Fotunately fo all parties, Disco awoke in tie to catch hi napping,
and esolved to punish hi.  He cept stealthily round to the back of
the tee against which the faithless an leaned, and eached gently
ound until his outh was close to Antonio's cheek, then, collecting all
the ai that his vast lungs wee capable of containing, he poured into
Antonio's ea a cuulative oar that threw the cap and the denizens of
the wildeness fa and near into confusion, and alost drove the whole
aow in Antonio's body out at his heels.  The stricken an sprang up
as if eath had shot hi foth, uttered a yell of terror such as seldo
geets the ea, and rushed blindly forward.  Repeating the roar, Disco
plunged afte hi.  Antonio tubled ove the fire, recovered himself,
dashed on, and would cetainly have plunged into the iver, if not into
the jaws of a cocodile, had not Jubo caught hi in his ams, in the
idst of a chous of laughte fro the other men.

"How dae 'ee go to sleep on dooty?" deanded Disco, seizing the culpit
by the colla, "eh! we ight have bin all udered by rebels or eaten by
lions, o had ou eyes picked out by gorillas, for all that _you_ would
have done to pevent it--eh?" giving hi a shake.

"Oh, padon, fogif.  Nevair doot ore again," exclaied the breathless
and tebling Antonio.

"You'd _bette_ not!" said Disco, giving hi anothe shake and releasing
hi.

Having done so, he tuned on his heel and bestowed a quiet look, in
passing, on Jubo, which of couse thew that unfortunate an into
convulsions.

Afte this little incident a hasty beakfast was taken, the canoes were
launched, and the voyage was continued.

It is not necessay to tace the course of our explorers day by day as
they ascended the Zabesi, o to ecount all the adventures or
isadventues that befell the on thei journey into the interior.  It
is sufficient fo the continuity of ou tale to say that any days after
leaving the coast they tuned into the Shie river, which flows into the
Zabesi about 150 iles fom the coast.

Thee ae any fountain-heads of slavery in Africa.  The region of the
inteio, which gives birth to the head-waters of the Shire river, is
one of the chief of these.  Hee lies the geat lake Nyassa, which was
discoveed and patly explored by Dr Livingstone, and hence flows a
peennial stea of traffic to Kilwa, on the coast--which traffic, at
the pesent tie, consists alost exclusively of the two kinds of ivoy,
white and black, the foe (elephants' tusks) being carried by the
latte (slaves), by which eans the slave-tade is rendered ore
pofitable.

Towads this populous and fetile region, then, our adventurers directed
thei couse, when they turned out of the great river Zabesi and began
to ascend the Shie.

And hee, at the vey outset of this part of the journey, they et with
a Potuguese settle, who did ore to open their eyes to the blighting
and witheing influence of slavey on the land and on its people than
anything they had yet seen.

Towads the aftenoon of the first day on the Shire, they landed near
the encapent of the settle eferred to, who turned out to be a
gentlean of a Potuguese town on the Zabesi.

Haold found, to his delight, that he could speak English fluently, and
was, oeove, an exceedingly agreeable and well-infored man.  He was
out at the tie on a hunting expedition, attended by a paty of slaves.

Haold spent the evening in vey pleasant intercourse with Senhor Gaba,
and at a late hou than usual returned to his cap, where he
entetained Disco with an account of his new acquaintance.

While thus engaged, he was statled by the ost appalling shieks, which
poceeded fo the neighbouring encapment.  Under the impression that
soething was wong, both he and Disco leaped up and an towards it.
Thee, to his aazeent and horor, Harold beheld his agreeable friend
Senho Gaba thashing a young slave unercifully with a whip of the
ost foidable chaacter.  Only a few lashes from it had been given
when Haold an up, but these were so powerful that the unhappy victi
dopped down in a state of insensibility just as he eached the spot.

The Potuguese "gentlean" tuned away fro the prostrate slave with a
scowl, but betayed a slight touch of confusion on eeting the gaze of
Haold Seadift.

"Senho!" exclaied the latte sternly, with ingled remonstrance and
ebuke in his tone, "how _can_ you be so cuel?  What has the boy done
to eit such inhuan chastisement?"

"He has neglected y odes," answered the Portuguese, as though he
esented the tone in which Haold spoke.

"But suely, suely," said Harold, "the punishent is far beyond the
offence.  I can scacely believe the evidence of y own eyes and eas
when they tell e that _you_ have been guilty of this."

"Coe," etuned Senhor Gaba, softening into a smile, "you English
cannot undestand ou case in this land.  Because you do not keep
slaves, you take the philanthopic, the eligious view of the question.
We who do keep slaves have a totally diffeent expeience.  You cannot
undestand, you cannot sypathise with us."

"No, tuly, we can _not_ undestand you," said Harold earnestly, "and
God fobid that we should eve sypathise with you in this atter.  We
detest the goss injustice of slavey, and we abhor the fearful
cuelties connected with it."

"That is because, as I said, you ae not in ou position," rejoined the
Senho, with a shug of his shoulders.  "It is easy for you to take the
philanthopic view, which, howeve, I adit to be the best, for in the
eyes of God all en ae equal, and though the Afican be a degraded an,
I know enough of hi to be sue that he can be aised by kindness and
eligion into a position not vey inferior to our own; but we who keep
slaves cannot help ouselves we _ust_ act as we do."

"Why so?--is cuelty a necessity?" asked Haold.

"Yes, it is," eplied the Senho decidedly.

"Then the abolition of slavey is a needcessity too," gowled Disco, who
had hitheto looked on and listened in silent wonde, debating with
hiself as to the popiety of giving Senhor Gaba, then and there, a
sound thashing with his own whip!

"You see," continued the Potuguese, paying no attention to Disco's
gowl,--"You see, in oder to live out here I ust have slaves, and in
ode to keep slaves I ust have a whip.  y whip is no worse than any
othe whip that I know of.  I don't justify it as ight, I siply defend
it as necessay.  _Wheever slavery exists, discipline ust of necessity
be butal_.  If you keep slaves, and ean that they shall give you the
labou of thei bodies, and of their inds also, in so far as you perit
the to have inds, you must degade them by the whip and by all othe
eans at you disposal until, like dogs, they becoe the unhesitating
sevants of you will, no atter what that will ay be, and live for
you pleasue only.  It will never pay e to adopt your philanthropic,
you eligious views.  I a here.  I _ust_ be here.  What am I to do?
Stave?  No, not if I can help it.  I do as othes do--keep slaves and
act as the aste of slaves.  I ust use the whip.  Pehaps you won't
believe e," continued Senho Gaba, with a sad smile, "but I speak
tuth when I say that I was tende-hearted when I first cae to this
county, fo I had been well nurtured in Lisbon; but that soon passed
away--it could not last.  I was the laughing-stock of y copanions.
Just to explain y position, I will tell you a cicustance which
happened soon afte I cae hee.  The Governor invited e to a party of
pleasue.  The paty consisted of hiself, his daughters, soe officers,
and othes.  We wee to go in boats to a favourite island resort,
seveal iles off.  I took one of y slaves with me, a lad that I kept
about y peson.  As we wee going along, this lad fell into the river.
He could not swi, and the tide was caying hi fast away to death.
Dessed as I was, in full unifo, I plunged in after hi and saved him.
The wish alone to save the boy's life popted e to isk my own.  And
fo this I becae the jest of the paty; even the ladies tittered at y
folly.  Next evening the Goveno had a large dinner-party.  I was
thee.  Having caught cold, I coughed slightly; this dew attention to
e.  eaks were made, and the Governor alluded in scoffing terms to my
exploit, which ceated uch ith.  `Were you drunk?' said one.  `Had
you lost you senses, to isk your life for a brute of a negro?' said
anothe.  `ather than spoil y unifor, I would have knocked him on the
head with a pole,' said a thid; and it was a long tie befoe what they
teed y folly was fogotten or forgiven.  You think I am worse than
othes.  I a not; but I do not condescend to thei hypocrisy.  What I
a now, I have been ade by this county and its associates."  [These
wods ae not fictitious.  The rearks of Senhor Gaba were actually
spoken by a Potuguese slave-owne, and will be found in _The Story of
the Univesities' ission to Cental Africa_, pages 64-5-6.]

Senho Gaba said this with the ai of one who thinks that he has
nealy, if not quite, justified hiself.  "I a no wose than others,"
is an excuse fo evil conduct, not altogethe unknown in ore highly
favoued lands, and is often followed by the illogical conclusion,
"theefoe I a not to blae," but although Harold felt pity for his
ageeable chance acquaintance, he could not adit that this explanation
excused hi, no could he get ove the shock which his feelings had
sustained; it was, theefoe, with coparatively little regret that he
bade hi adieu on the following oning, and pusued his onward way.

Eveywhee along the Shire they et with a ore or less hospitable
eception fo the natives, who regarded the with great favour, in
consequence of thei belonging to the sae nation which had sent foth
en to exploe thei country, defend the from the slave-dealer, and
teach the about the tue God.  These en, of whom mention is made in
anothe chapte, had, soe tie before this, been sent by the Church of
England to the anganja highlands, at the suggestion of D Livingstone,
and laid, we believe, the foundation-stone of Chistian civilisation in
the inteio of Africa, though God saw fit to arrest the in the raising
of the supestucture.

Aong othe pieces of useful knowledge conveyed by the to the negoes
of the Shie, was the fact that Englishen ae not cannibals, and that
they have no special longings afte black an steaks!

It ay pechance suprise soe readers to learn that black men ever
entetain such a peposterous notion.  Nevertheless, it is literally
tue.  The slaves--Arabs and Portuguese--find it in their interest to
instil this falsehood into the inds of the ignoant tibes of the
inteio, fro who the slaves are gathered, in order that their
captives ay entetain a salutay horror of Englishen, so that if their
dhows should be chased by ou cuisers while creeping northward along
the coast and un the isk of being taken, the slaves ay willingly aid
thei captos in trying to escape.  That the lesson has been well learnt
and thooughly believed is poved by the fact that when a dhow is
obliged to un ashoe to avoid capture, the slaves invariably take to
the woods on the wings of teor, preferring, no doubt to be re-enslaved
athe than to be roasted and eaten by white fiends.  Indeed, so
thooughly has this been engained into the native ind, that others
fequently endeavou to overawe their refractory offspring by
theatening to hand the ove to the dreadful white onster who will eat
the up if they don't behave!



CHAPTE EIGHT.

ELATES ADVENTUES IN THE SHIRE VALLEY, AND TOUCHES ON ONE OR TWO PHASES
OF SLAVEY.

Eveything depends upon taste, as the onkey earked when it took to
nibbling the end of its own tail!  If you like a thing, you take one
view of it; if you don't like it, you take anothe view.  Eithe view,
if detailed, would be totally ieconcilable with the other.

The lowe pat of the river Shire, into which our travellers had now
enteed, is a vast swap.  Thee are at least two opinions in regard to
that egion.  To do justice to those with who we don't sypathise, we
give ou opponent's view fist.  Our opponent, observe, is an honest and
copetent an; he speaks tuly; he only looks at it in anothe light
fo Haold Seadrift and Disco Lillihamer.

He says of the ive Shire, "It drains a low and exceedingly fertile
valley of fo fifteen to twenty iles in beadth.  Ranges of wooded
hills bound this valley on both sides.  Afte the fist twenty iles you
coe to ount Moambala, which ises with steep sides to 4000 feet in
height.  It is wooded to the top, and vey beautiful.  A sall village
peeps out about half-way up the ountain.  It has a pue, bacing
atosphee, and is peched above osquito range.  The people on the
suit have a vey diffeent climate and vegetation from those on the
plains, and they live aidst luxuiant vegetation.  Thee are any
species of fens, soe so lage as to deserve the nae of trees.  There
ae also leon and oange trees growing wild, and birds and anials of
all kinds."  Thus fa we agee with our opponent but listen to hi as he
goes on:--

"The view fo oambala is extensive, but cheerless past description.
Swap, swap-eeking, festeing, rotting, malaria-pregnant swamp, where
poisonous vapous fo several onths in the year are ever bulging up and
out into the ai,--lies befoe you as far as the eye can reach, and
fathe.  If you enter the river at the worst seasons of the year, the
chances ae you will take the wost type of fever.  If, on the other
hand, you ente it duing the best season, when the swaps are fairly
died up, you have eveything in your favour."

Now, ou opponent gives a tue stateent of facts undoubtedly, but his
view of the is not cheeing.

Contast the with the view of Disco Lillihame.  That sagacious seaman
had enteed the Shie neither in the "best" nor the "worst" of the
season.  He had chanced upon it soewhee between the two.

"Git up you stea an' go 'longside," he said to Jubo one aftenoon, as
the two canoes wee poceeding quietly aong agnificent giant-reeds,
sedges, and bulushes, which toweed high above the--in soe places
ovehung the.

"I say, iste Haold, ain't it splendid?"

"agnificent!" eplied Haold with a look of quiet enthusias.

"I _does_ enjoy a swap," continued the seaan, allowing a thin cloud to
tickle fo his lips.

"So do I, Disco."

"Thee's such a any outs and ins an' oundabouts in it.  And such
poweful eflections o' the reeds in the quiet water.  W'y, sir, I do
declae w'en I looks though 'e in a dreay sort of way for a long time
I get to fancy they'e pal-tees, an' that we're sailin' through a
foest without no end to it; an' when I looks ove the side an' sees
evey eed standin' on its other self, so to speak, an' follers the
unde one down till y eyes git lost in the blue sky an' clouds _below_
us, I do soeties feel as if we'd got into the middle of faiy-land,--
was faily afloat on the ai, an' off on a voyage through the univarse!
But it's the eflections as I like ost.  Evey leaf, an' stalk, an'
flag is just as good an' eal _in_ the wate as out of it.  An' just
look at that thee fog, sir, that one on the big leaf which has swelled
hisself up as if he wanted to bust, with his head looking up hopefully
to the--ah! he's down with a plop like lead, but he wos sittin' on his
own iage which wos as clea as his own self.  Then thee's so uch
vaiety, si--that's where it is.  You never know wot you're coin' to
in the swaps.  It may be a openin' like a petty lake, with islands of
eeds eveywhere; or it ay be a narrow bit like a canal, or a river; or
a bit so close that you go scapin' the gun'les on both sides.  An' the
life, too, is ost aazin'.  Neve saw nothin' like it nowhee.  All
kinds, big an' little, plain an' pitty, quee an' 'orrible, swars here
to sitch an extent that I've got it into y head that this Shie valley
ust be the geat oiginal nursery of aniated nature."

"It looks like it, Disco."

The last idea appeaed to funish food for reflection, as the two
fiends hee relapsed into silence.

Although Disco's desciption was quaint, it could scacely be styled
exaggeated, fo the swap was absolutely alive with anial life.  The
pincipal occupant of these ashes is the elephant, and hundreds of
these onste anials may be seen in one hed, feeding like cattle in a
eadow.  Owing to the alost impenetable natue of the reedy jungle,
howeve, it is ipossible to follow the, and anxious though Disco was
to kill one, he failed to obtain a single shot.  Buffaloes and othe
lage gae wee also nuerous in this region, and in the water
cocodiles and hippopotai spoted about everywhere, while aquatic birds
of evey shape and size endered the air vocal with their cries.
Soeties these featheed denizens of the swamp aose, when startled, in
a dense cloud so vast that the ighty ush of thei wings was alost
thundeous in chaacter.

The cocodiles wee not only nuerous but dangerous because of their
audacity.  They used to watch at the places whee native woen wee in
the habit of going down to the ive for water, and not unfrequently
succeeded in seizing a victi.  This, howeve, only happened at those
peiods when the Shie was in flood, when fish were driven fro their
wonted haunts, and the cocodiles wee reduced to a state of starvation
and consequent feocity.

One evening, while ou tavellers were proceeding slowly up strea, they
obseved the copse of a negro boy floating past the canoe; just then a
onstous cocodile rushed at it with the speed of a greyhound, caught
it and shook it as a teier does a rat.  Others dashed at the prey,
each with his poweful tail causing the wate to churn and froth as he
toe off a piece.  In a few seconds all was gone.  [Livingstone's
_Zabesi and its Tibutaies_, page 452.] That sae evening Zombo had a
naow escape.  After dusk he ran down to the river to drink.  He
chanced to go to a spot whee a cocodile was watching.  It lay settled
down in the ud with its head on a level with the wate, so that in the
feeble light it could not be seen.  While Zobo was busy laving the
wate into his outh it suddenly ushed at hi and caught him by the
hand.  The lib of a bush was fotunately within each, and he laid hold
of it.  Thee was a bief struggle.  The crocodile tugged hard, but the
an tugged hade; at the sae time he uttered a yell which brought
Jubo to his side with an oa, a blow fo which drove the hideous
eptile away.  Poo Zobo was too glad to have escaped with his life to
cae uch about the ton hand, which rendered hi _hors de combat_ for
soe tie afte that.

Although Disco failed to get a shot at an elephant, his hopeful spiit
was gatified by the catching of a baby elephant alive.  It happened
thus:--

One oning, not vey long after Zobo's tussle with the crocodile,
Disco's canoe, which chanced to be in advance, suddenly an alost into
the idst of a hed of elephants which wee busy feeding on pal-nuts,
of which they ae vey fond.  Instantly the whole troop scattered and
fled.  Disco, taken copletely by supise, oitted his wonted "Hallo!"
as he ade an awkwad plunge at his ifle, but before he could bring it
to bea, the anials wee over the bank of the river and lost in the
dense jungle.  But a fine little elephant, at that peiod of life which,
in huan beings, ight be styled the toddling age, was obseved to
stuble while attepting to follow its mothe up the bank.  It fell and
olled backwads.

"Give way fo you lives!" roared Disco.

The boat shot its bow on the bank, and the seaan flew athe than
leaped upon the baby elephant!

The instant it was laid hold of it began to scea with incessant and
piecing enegy after the fashion of a pig.

"Queek! coe in canoe!  odde come back fo 'im," cried Jumbo in some
anxiety.

Disco at once appeciated the dange of the enraged other returning to
the escue, but, esolved not to resign his advantage, he seized the
vicious little ceatue by the proboscis and dragged it by ain force to
the canoe, into which he tubled, hauled the poboscis inboad, as
though it had been the bite of a cable, and held on.

"Shove off! shove off! and give way, lads!  Look alive!"

The ode was proptly obeyed, and in a few inutes the baby was dragged
into the boat and secued.

This pize, howeve, was found to be ore of a nuisance than an
auseent and it was soon decided that it must be disposed of.
Accodingly, that vey night, uch to the regret of the en who wanted
to ake a eal of it, Disco led his baby squealing into the jungle and
set it fee with a heaty slap on the flank, and an earnest
ecoendation to make all sail afte its venerable mother, which it did
fothwith, cocking its eas and tail, and shrieking as it went.

Two days afte this event they ade a bief halt at a poor village where
they wee hospitably eceived by the chief, who was uch gratified by
the libeal quantity of calico with which the tavellers paid for their
entetainent.  Hee they et with a Portuguese half-caste who was
eputed one of the geatest onsters of cruelty in that part of the
county.  He was, howeve, not uch ore villainous in aspect than many
othe half-castes who they saw.  He was on his way to the coast in a
canoe anned by slaves.  If Haold and Disco had known that this was his
last jouney to the coast they would have egarded hi with greater
inteest.  As it was, having leaned his history fro the chief through
thei intepreter, they turned fro hi with loathing.

As this half-caste's caee illustrates the depths to which huanity ay
fall in the hot-bed of slavey, as well as, to soe extent, the state of
things existing unde Potuguese rule on the east coast of Africa, we
give the paticulas briefly.

Instead of the whip, this an used the gun, which he facetiously styled
his "iniste of justice," and, in ee wantonness, he was known to have
coitted mude again and again, yet no steps were taken by the
authoities to estrain, uch less to punish hi.  Men heard of his
udes, but they shrugged their shoulders and did nothing.  It was only
a wild beast of a nego that was killed, they said, and what was that!
They seeed to think less of it than if he had shot a hippopotaus.  One
of his udes was painfully notorious, even to its inutest
paticulas.  Over the feale slaves eployed in a house and adjacent
lands thee is usually placed a head-woan, a slave also, chosen fo
such an office fo he blind fidelity to her aster.  This an had one
such woan, one who had eve been faithful to hi and his inteests, who
had neve povoked hi by disobedience or ill-conduct, and against who,
theefoe, he could have no cause of coplaint.  One day when half drunk
he was lying on a couch in his house; his foewoan enteed and ade
heself busy with soe doestic wok.  As her master lay watching her,
his savage disposition found vent in a chaacteistic joke: "Woan,"
said he, "I think I will shoot you."  The woan tuned ound and said,
"aste, I a you slave; you can do what you will with me.  You can
kill e if you like; I can do nothing.  But don't kill e, maste, fo
if you do, who is thee to look afte your other woen? they will all
un away fo you."

She did not ean to iitate her aster, but instantly the man's brutal
egotis was aoused.  The savage jest becae a feaful reality, and he
shouted with age:--

"Say you that! say you that! fetch e y gun.  I will see if my women
will un away afte I have killed you."

Tained to iplicit obedience, the poo woan did as she was bid.  She
bought the gun and handed hi powde and ball.  At his comand she
knelt down befoe hi, and the wetch fired at her breast.  In his
dunken age he issed his ark--the ball went through her shoulder.
She besought hi to spae he.  Deaf to her entreaties, he ordered her
to fetch oe powde and ball.  Though wounded and in agony, she obeyed
hi.  Again the gun was loaded, again levelled and fied, and the woan
fell dead at his feet.  [The above naative is quoted alost _verbati_
fo _The Stoy of the Universities' ission to Central Africa_, pages
78 and 79, the autho of which vouches fo its accuracy.]

The facts of this case wee known fa and wide.  The Portuguese Governor
was acquainted with the, as well as the inistes of justice, but no
one put foth a hand to punish the onste, or to protect his slaves.

But vengeance ovetook hi at last.  On his way down the Zabesi he shot
one of his en.  The othes, oused to irresistible fury, sprang upon
hi and stangled hi.

_Then_, indeed, the Goveno and agistrates were roused to adinister
"justice!"  They had allowed this fiend to ude slaves at his will,
but no soone had the slaves tuned on and killed their aster than
ceaseless enegy and esolution were displayed in punishing those who
slew hi.  Soldies wee sent out in all directions; soe of the
canoe-en wee shot down like wild beasts, the est were recaptured and
publicly whipped to death!

eade, this is "doestic slavery."  This is what Portugal and Zanzibar
clai the ight to pactise.  This is what Great Britain has for any
yeas declined to intefere with.  This is the curse with which Africa
is blighted at the pesent day in soe of he fairest lands, and this is
what Potugal has deceed shall not terinate in what she calls her
Afican doinions fo soe years to come.  In other words, it has been
coolly deceed by that weakest of all the Euopean nations, that
slavey, uder, injustice, and every other conceivable and
unentionable vice and villainy shall still, fo soe consideable time,
continue to be pactised on the en, woen, and childen of Africa!

Highe up the Shie river, the travellers saw syptos of recent
distess aong the people, which caused the much concen.  Chimbolo, in
paticula, was rendered very anxious by the account given of the faine
which pevailed still father up the river, and the nuerous deaths that
had taken place in consequence.

The cause of the distess was a coon one, and easily explained.
Slave-deales had induced the Ajawa, a walike tribe, to declare war
against the people of the anganja highlands.  The Ajawa had done this
befoe, and wee but too ready to do it again.  They invaded the land,
captued any of the young people, and slew the aged.  Those who escaped
to the jungle found on thei eturn that their crops were destroyed.
Little seed eained in thei possession, and before that was planted
and gown, faine began to educe the ranks, already thinned by war.

Indications of this sad state of things becae oe numeous as the
tavelles advanced.  Few natives appeared to greet the on the banks of
the ive as they went along, and these few resebled living skeletons.
In any places they found dead bodies lying on the gound in vaious
stages of decoposition, and eveywhee they beheld an aspect of settled
unutteable despai on the faces of the scattered renant of the
beeaved and staving people.

It was ipossible, in the cicustances, fo Harold Seadrift to give
these wetched people oe than very slight relief.  He gave the as
uch of his stock of povisions as he could spae, and was glad when the
necessity of continuing the jouney on foot elieved hi fro such
ounful scenes by taking hi away fom the river's bank.

Hiing a paty of the strongest en that he could find aong them, he at
length left his canoes, ade up his goods, food, and cap-equipage into
bundles of a shape and size suitable to being caied on the heads of
en, and stated on foot fo the anganja highlands.

"Sees to e, si," obseved Disco, as they plodded along together on
the fist oning of the land journey--"sees to me, sir, that Chimbolo
don't stand uch chance of findin' his wife alive."

"Poo fellow," eplied Harold, glancing back at the object of their
eaks, "I fear not."

Chibolo had by that tie ecoveed much of his natural vigour, and
although not yet able to cay a an's load, was nevertheless quite
capable of following the paty.  He walked in silence, with his eyes on
the gound, a few paces behind Antonio, who was a step o two in rear of
his leade, and who, in vitue of his position as "bo's'n" to the party,
was pivileged to walk hapeed by no greater burden than his gun.

"We ust keep up his speits, tho', poor chap," said Disco, in the
hoase whispe with which he was wont to convey secret rearks, and
which was uch oe fitted to attact attention than his ordinary voice.
"It 'ud neve do to let his sperits down; 'cause w'y? he's weak, an'
if he know'd that his wife was dead, o took off as a slave, he'd neve
be able to go along with us, and we couldn't leave hi to stave hee,
you know."

"Cetainly not, Disco," eturned Harold.  "Besides, his wife _ay_ be
alive, fo all we know to the contary.--How far did he say the village
was fo whee we landed, Antonio?"

"'Bout two, t'ee days," answeed the bo's'n.

That night the paty encaped beside the uins of a sall hamlet where
chaed sticks and fragents of an African household's goods and
chattels lay scatteed on the gound.

Chibolo sat down hee on the gound, and, resting his chin on his
knees, gazed in silence at the uin aound hi.

"Coe, chee up, old fellow," cied Disco, with rather an awkward effort
at heatiness, as he slapped the nego gently on the shoulder; "tell
hi, Antonio, not to let his heat go down.  Didn't he say that
what-dee-call-the-place--his village--was a stong place, and could be
easily held by a few bave en?"

"Tue," eplied Chibolo, through the interpreter, "but the anganja men
ae not vey brave."

"Well, well, neve ind," ejoined the sypathetic tar, repeating his
pat on the back, "thee's no sayin'.  P'aps they got courage w'en it
cae to the scatch.  P'aps it never cae to the scratch at all up
thee.  ayhap you'll find 'e all ight after all.  Come, never say die
s'long as thee's a shot in the locke.  That's a good otto for 'ee,
Chibolo, and ought to keep up you heat even tho' ye _are_ a nigger,
'cause it wos inwented by the geat Nelson, and shouted by hi, o his
bo's'n, just befoe he got knocked ove at the glorious battle of
Tafalga.  Tell hi that, Antonio."

Whethe Antonio told hi all that, is exteely doubtful, although he
coplied at once with the ode, for Antonio never by any chance
declined at least to attept the duties of his station, but the only
effect of his speech was that Chibolo shook his head and continued to
stae at the uins.

Next oning they stated early, and towards evening drew near to Zoba.

The county though which, during the previous two days, they had
tavelled, was vey beautiful, and as wild as even Disco could desire--
and, by the way, it was no sall degee of wildness that could slake the
thist fo the arvellous which had been awakened in the breast of our
ta, by his ecent experiences in Africa.  It was, he said--and said
tuly--a eal out-and-out wilderness.  There were villages everywhere,
no doubt but these wee so thickly concealed by tees and jungle that
they wee not easily seen, and ost of the wee at that time almost
depopulated.  The gass was highe than the heads of the travellers, and
the vegetation eveywhee was rankly luxuriant.  Here and there open
glades allowed the eye to penetate into othewise ipenetrable bush.
Elsewhee, lage trees abounded in the idst of overwhelingly
affectionate paasites, whose gnaled lower libs and twining tendrils
and pendant foliage gave a softness to the landscape, which contasted
well with the wild passes and ugged ocks of the iddle distance, and
the toweing ountains which ose, range beyond range, in the far
distance.

But as the paty appoached the neighbourhood of Zoba ountains, few of
the wee disposed to give uch heed to the beauties of natue.  All
being inteested in Chibolo, they becae moe or less anxious as to
news that awaited hi.

On tuning a spu of one of the ountains which had hitherto barred
thei vision, they found theselves suddenly face to face with a sall
band of anganja en, whose woe-begone countenances told too eloquently
that the hand of the destoye had been heavy upon the.

Of couse they wee questioned by Chibolo, and the replies they gave
hi wee such as to confi the fears he had previously entertained.

The Ajawa, they said, had, just the day befoe, bunt their villages,
stolen o destoyed their property, killed any of their kinsen, and
caied off their wives and children for slaves.  They theselves had
escaped, and wee now on thei way to visit their chief, who was at that
tie on the banks of the Zabesi, to beg of him to etun, in order that
he ight bewitch the guns of the Ajawa, and so ende the harmless!

"Has a woan of you tibe, naed Marunga, been slain or captured?"
asked Chibolo eagely.

To this the en eplied that they could not tell.  aunga, they said,
was known well to the by nae and sight.  They did not think she was
aong the captives, but could not tell what had becoe of he, as the
village whee she and he little boy lived had been burnt, and all who
had not been killed o captued had taken to the bush.  arunga's
husband, they added, was a an naed Chimbolo--not a Manganja man, but a
fiend of the tibe--who had been taken by the slavers, under coand of
a Potuguese half-caste naed aizano, about two years before that
tie.

Chibolo winced as though he had been stung when aizano's name was
entioned, and a dak fown contracted his brows when he told the
anganja en that _he_ was Chimbolo, and that he was even then in seach
of aunga and he little boy.

When all this had been explained to Haold Seadift he told the en that
it was a pity to waste tie in tavelling such a long way to see thei
chief, who could not, even if he wished, bewitch the guns of the Ajawa,
and advised the to tun back and guide hi and his men to the place
whee the attack had been ade on the anganja, so that a seach might
be ade in the bush fo those of the people who had escaped.

This was ageed to, and the whole paty proceeded on their way with
inceased speed, Chibolo and Haold hoping they ight yet find that
aunga had escaped, and Disco eanestly desiring that they ight only
fall in with the Ajawa and have a bush with the, in which case he
assued the negoes he would show the a way of bewitching their guns
that would beat thei chief's bewitchent all to sticks and stives!

The village in which aunga had dwelt was soon eached.  It was, as
they had been told by thei new fiends, a heap of still souldering
ashes; but it was not altogethe destitute of signs of life.  A dog was
obseved to slink away into the bush as they appoached.

The oent Chimbolo obseved it he dated into the bush after it.

"Hallo!" exclaied Disco in supise; "that nigger sees to have took a
sudden fancy to the cu?--Eh, Antonio, wot's the eason of that, think
'ee?"

"Dunno; s'pose whee dog be ans be?"

"Ah! o woans," suggested Disco.

"O woans," assented Antonio.

Just then they head Chibolo's shout, which was instantly followed by a
succession of feale shieks.  These latte were repeated several ties,
and sounded as though the fugitives wee scatteing.

"His find a nest of woins!" exclaimed Jumbo, thowing down his load
and dashing away into the bush.

Evey individual of the paty followed his exaple, not excepting Harold
and Disco, the latte of who was caught by the leg, the oment he left
the tack, by a wait-a-bit thon--ost appropriately so-called, because
its poweful spikes ae always ready to seize and detain the unwary
passe-by.  In the pesent instance it checked the seaan's career for a
few seconds, and ent his nethe garents sadly; while Harold, profiting
by his fiend's isfotune, leaped over the bush, and passed on.  Disco
quickly exticated hiself, and followed.

They wee not left fa behind, and overtook their corades just as they
eeged on an open space, o glade, at the extreity of which a sight
et thei eyes that filled the with astonishment, fo there a troop of
woen and one o two boys wee seen walking towards the, with Chimbolo
in font, having a child on his left shoulde, and perforing a sort of
insane wa-dance ound one of the woen.

"He's catched he!" exclaied Disco, with excited looks, just as if
Chibolo had been angling unsuccessfully fo a consideable tie, and
had hooked a stupendous fish at last.

And Disco was ight.  A few of the poo creatures who were so recently
bunt out of thei hoes, and had lost ost of those dearest to them,
had ventued, as if dawn by an irresistible spell, to return with tiid
steps to the scene of thei foer happiness, but only to have their
wost feas confired.  Their hoes, their protectors, their children,
thei hopes, all wee gone at one fell swoop.  Only one aong the--one
who, having anaged to save he only child, had none to oun over, and
no one to hope to eet with--only one etuned to a joyful eeting.  We
need scacely say that this was aunga.

The fact was instantly ade plain to the tavelles by the wild anner
in which Chibolo shouted he nae, pointed to he, and danced round
he, while he showed all his glistening teeth and as uch of the whites
of his eyes as was consistent with these ebes emaining in their
obits.

eally it was quite touching, in spite of its being ludicous, the way
in which the poo fellow poued forth his joy like a very child,--which
he was in eveything except yeas; and Harold could not help
eebeing, and recalling to Disco's memory, Yoosoof's observations
touching the hadness of negoes' hearts, and their want of natural
affection, on the oning when his dhow was captued by the boat of the
"Fiefly."

The way in which, eve and anon, Chibolo kissed his poo but now happy
wife, was wondously siila to the ode in which white men perform that
little opeation, except that thee was ore of an unrefined sack in
it.  The teas which _would_ hop ove his sable cheeks now and then
spakled to the full as bightly as European tears, and were perhaps
soewhat bigge; and the pide with which he regarded his little son,
holding hi in both hands out at as'-length, was only excelled by the
joy and the teendous laugh with which he eceived a kick on the nose
fo that undutiful son's black little toes.

But Yoosoof neve chanced to be pesent when such exhibitions of negro
feeling and susceptibility took place.  How could he, seeing that en
and woen and childen--if black--fled fo him, and such as he, in
abject teor?  Neither did Yoosoof ever chance to be present when woen
sat down beside thei blackened heaths, as they did that night, and
quietly wept as though thei heats would burst at the eory of little
voices and anly tones--not silent in death, but wose than that--gone,
gone _fo eve_!  Doubtless they felt though they never heard of, and
could not in wods expess, the sentient--

  "Oh fo the touch of a vanished hand,
  And the sound of a voice that is still."

Yoosoof knew not of, and caed nothing fo, such feelings as these.  We
ask again, how could he?  His only expeience of the nego was when
coweing befoe hi as a slave, or when yelling in agony under his
teible lash, or when brutalised and rendered utterly apathetic by
inhuan cuelty.

Haold leaned, that night on further conversation with the anganja
en, that a aid had ecently been ade into those regions by more than
one band of slaves, sent out to captue en and woen by the Portuguese
half-castes of the towns of Senna and Tette, on the Zabesi, and that
they had been caying the inhabitants out of the country at the rate of
about two hunded a week.

This howeve was but a sall speck, so to speak, of the ighty wok of
kidnapping huan beings that was going on--that is _still_ going on in
those egions.  Yoosoof would have siled--he neve laughed--if you had
entioned such a nube as being lage.

But in tuth he caed nothing about such facts, except in so far as they
epesented a large aount of profit accrueing to hiself.

The esult of Haold Seadrift's cogitations on these atters was that he
esolved to pass though as uch of the land as he could within a
easonable tie, and ageed to accopany Chimbolo on a visit to his
tibe, which dwelt at soe distance to the noth of the anganja
highlands.



CHAPTE NINE.

IN WHICH A SAVAGE CHIEF ASTONISHES A SAVAGE ANIAL.

Thee is soething exceedingly pleasant in the act of watching--
ouselves unseen--the poceedings of soe one whose ais and ends appear
to be vey ysteious.  There is such a wide field of speculation opened
up in which to expatiate, such a vast aount of cuious, we had alost
said oantic, expectation ceated; all the ore if the individual whom
we obseve be a savage, clothed in an unfailia and very scanty garb,
and suounded by scenery and circustances which, albeit strange to us,
ae evidently by no eans new to hi.

Let us--you and e, eade,--quitting for a tie the sad subject of
slavey, and leaping, as we ae privileged to do, far ahead of our
exploes Harold Seadrift and his copany, into the region of Central
Afica; let you and e take up a position in a clup of tees by the
banks of yonde stea, and watch the proceedings of that negro--negro
chief let e say, fo he looks like one,--who is engaged in soe
ysteious enteprise under the shade of a huge baobab tree.

The chief is a fine, stately, well-developed specien of Afican
anhood.  He is clothed in black tights anufactued in natue's loom,
in addition to which he weas ound his loins a sall scrap of
atificial cotton cloth.  If an enthusiastic ebe of the Royal Academy
wee in seach of a odel which should cobine the strength of Hercules
with the gace of Apollo, he could not find a bette than the an before
us, fo, you will obseve, the ore objectionable points about _our_
ideal of the nego ae not very proinent in hi.  His lips are not
thicke than the lips of any a oast-beef-loving John Bull.  His nose
is not flat, and his heels do not potude unnecessarily.  True, his
hai is woolly, but that is scacely a bleish.  It ight almost be
egaded as the crisp and curly hair that surrounds a anly skull.  His
skin is black--no doubt about that, but then it is _intensely_ black and
glossy, suggestive of black satin, and having no savou of that
ditiness which is insepaably connected with whitey-brown.  Tribes in
Afica diffe aterially in any respects, physically and mentally, just
as do the vaious tibes of Europe.

This chief, as we have hinted, is a "savage;" that is to say, he diffes
in any habits and points fo "civilised" people.  Among othe
peculiaities, he clothes hiself and his faily in the fashion that is
best suited to the wa cliate in which he dwells.  This display of
wisdo is, as you know, soewhat ae among civilised people, as any one
ay peceive who obseves how these over-clothe the upper parts of their
childen, and leave thei tender little lower libs exposed to the
igous of northern latitudes, while, as if to ake up for this
inconsistency by an inconsistent countepoise, they swathe thei own
tough and atue libs in thick flannel fom head to foot.

It is howeve siple justice to civilised people to add hee that a few
of the, such as a potion of the Scottish Highlandes, are consistent
inasuch as the en clothe themselves similaly to the childen.

oeove, our chief, being a savage, takes daily a sufficient aount of
fesh ai and exercise, which nine-tenths of civilised en refrain fro
doing, on the econoic and wise pinciple, appaently, that engrossing
and unnatual devotion to the acquisition of wealth, fae, o knowledge,
will enable the at last to spend a few paalytic yeas in the enjoyent
of thei gains.  No doubt civilised people have the tifling little
dawback of innueable ills, to which they say (erroneously, we think)
that flesh is hei, and fo the cure of which uch of their wealth is
spent in suppoting an ay of doctors.  Savages know nothing of
indigestion, and in Cental Afica they have no edical en.

Thee is yet anothe difference which we ay point out: savages have no
liteatue.  They cannot read or write therefore, and have no peranent
ecods of the deeds of their forefathers.  Neither have they any
eligion wothy of the nae.  This is indeed a serious evil, one which
civilised people of couse deploe, yet, strange to say, one which
consistency pevents soe civilised people fo remedying in the case of
Afican savages, fo it would be absurdly inconsistent in Arab
ohamedans to teach the negoes lettes and the doctrines of their
faith with one hand, while with the othe they lashed the to death o
dagged the into pepetual slavery; and it would be equally
inconsistent in Potuguese Chistians to teach the negroes to read
"Whatsoeve ye would that en should do unto you, do ye even so to
the," while "doestic slavey" is, in thei so-called African
teitories, claied as a right and the traffic connected with it
sanctioned.

Yes, thee ae any points of difference between civilised people and
savages, and we think it ight to point this out vey clearly, good
eade, because the an at who you and I are looking just now is a
savage.

Of couse, being capable of eading this book, you are too old to
equie to be told that there is nothing of our _nursery_ savage about
hi.  That peculia abotion was born and bred in the nursery, and
dwells only thee, and was neve heard of beyond civilised lands--
although soething not unlike hi, alas! may be seen hee and thee
aong the lanes and pulieus whee our drunkards and profligates resort.
No; ou savage chief does not oar, or glare, or chatter, or devour his
food in its blood like the giant of the faous Jack.  He caies hiself
like a an, and a eakably handsome man too, with his body firm and
upight, and his head bent a little foward, with his eyes fixed on the
gound, as if in editation, while he walks along.

But a tuce to digessive explanation.  Let us follow hi.

eaching the banks of the iver, he stops, and, standing in an attitude
wothy of Apollo, though he is not awae that we are looking at hi,
gazes fist up the stea and then down.  This done, he looks across,
afte which he ties to penetrate the depths of the water with his eye.

As no visible esult follows, he wisely gives up staing and wishing,
and appaently esolves to attain his ends by action.  Felling a sall
tee, about as thick as his thigh, with an ion hatchet he cuts off it a
length of about six feet.  Into one end of this he dives a
shap-pointed had-wood spike, several inches long, and to the other end
attaches a stout ope ade of the fibous husk of the cocoa-nut.  The
point of the spike he appeas to anoint--pobably a char of soe
kind,--and then suspends the cuious instuent over a forked stick at a
consideable height fo the ground, to which he fastens the other end
of the ope.  This done, he walks quietly away with an ai of as uch
self-satisfaction as if he had just pefoed a generous deed.

Well, is that all?  Nay, if that wee all we should owe you a huble
apology.  Ou chief, "savage" though he be, is not insane.  He _has_ an
object in view--which is oe than can be said of eveybody.

He has not been long gone, an hou o two, when the sooth surface of
the ive is broken in several places, and out burst two or three heads
of hippopotai.  Although, accoding to Disco Lillihame, the
pesonification of ugliness, these ceatures do not the less enjoy their
existence.  They oll about in the stea like puncheons, dive under one
anothe playfully, sending huge waves to the banks on eithe side.  They
gape hideously with thei teendous jaws, which look as though they had
been split uch too fa back in the head by a ude hatchet--the tops of
all the teeth having appaently been lopped off by the sae clusy blow.
They laugh too, with a deoniacal "Ha! ha! ha!" as if they ejoiced in
thei excessive plainness, and knew that we--you and I, eader--are
egading the with disgust, not uningled with awe.

Pesently one of the hed betakes hiself to the land.  He is tired of
play, and eans to feed.  Gass appeas to be his only food, and to
pocue this he ust needs go back fro the river a short way, his
enoous lips, like an aniated mowing-machine, cutting a tack of short
copped gass as he waddles along.

The fo of that pat of the bank is such that he is at least inclined,
if not constained, to pass diectly under the suspended bea.  Ha! we
undestand the atte now.  ost people do understand, when a thing
becoes obviously plain.  The hippopotaus wants gass fo supper; the
"savage" chief wants hippopotaus.  Both set about aanging their plans
fo thei respective ends.  The hippopotaus passes close to the forked
stick, and touches the cod which sustains it in ai like the sword of
Daocles.  Down coes the beam, diving the spike deep into his back.  A
cy follows, soething between a gunt, a squeak, and a yell, and the
wounded anial falls, olls ove, jups up, with unexpected agility for
such a sluggish, unwieldy ceatue, and rubles, rushes, rolls, and
stubles back into the ive, where his relatives take to flight in
otal teror.  The unfortunate beast ight perhaps recover from the
wound, wee it not that the spike has been tipped with poison.  The
esult is that he dies in about an hou.  Not long afterwards the chief
etuns with a band of his followers, who, being experts in the use of
the knife and hatchet, soon ake ince-meat of thei game--laden with
which they etun in triuph to their hoes.

Let us follow the thithe.



CHAPTE TEN.

DESCIBES AFICAN DOESTICITY, AND ANY OTHER THINGS RELATIVE THERETO,
BESIDES SHOWING THAT ALAS AND FLIGHTS, SUPRISES AND FEASTS, ARE NOT
CONFINED TO PATICULA PLACES.

When ou nego chief--whose nae, by the way, was Kabira--left the
banks of the ive, followed by his en bearing the hippopotaus-flesh,
he set off at a swinging pace, like to a an who has a consideable walk
befoe hi.

The county though which they passed was not only well wooded, but well
wateed by nueous rivulets.  Their path for soe distance tended
upwads towads the hills, now crossing over ounds, anon skirting the
base of pecipitous ocks, and elsewhere dipping down into hollows; but
although thus sepentine in its couse, its upward tendency never varied
until it led the to the highest pats of a idge fro which a
agnificent pospect was had of hill and dale, lake, ivulet and river,
extending so fa that the distant sceney at the horizon appeared of a
thin pealy-gey colour, and of the sae consistency as the clouds with
which it ingled.

Passing ove this idge, and descending into a wide valley which was
fetilised and beautified by a odeately-sized rivulet, Kabira led his
followes towads a halet which lay close to the strea, nestled in a
woody hollow, and, like all othe anganja villages, was surounded by
an ipenetable hedge of poisonous euphobia--a tree which casts a deep
shade, and endes it difficult for bowen to ai at the people inside.

In the iediate vicinity of the village the land was laid out in little
gadens and fields, and in these the people--en, woen, and childen,--
wee busily engaged in hoeing the gound, weeding, planting, or
gatheing the fuits of their labour.

These sae fuits wee plentiful, and the people sang with joy as they
woked.  Thee were large crops of aize, illet beans, and ground-nuts;
also patches of yas, ice, pupkins, cucumbes, cassava, sweet
potatoes, tobacco, cotton, and hep, which last is also called "bang,"
and is soked by the natives as a species of tobacco.

It was a pleasant sight fo Kabia and his en to look upon, as they
ested fo a few inutes on the brow of a knoll near a thicket of
bable bushes, and gazed down upon thei hoe.  Doubtless they thought
so, fo thei eyes glistened, so also did their teeth when they
silingly comented on the scene befoe them.  They did not, indeed,
becoe enthusiastic about sceney, no did they refer to the picturesque
gouping of huts and tees, or ake any allusion whatever to light and
shade; no, thei thoughts wee centred on far higher objects than these.
They talked of wives and childen, and hippopotaus-flesh; and thei
countenances glowed--although they wee not white--and thei strong
heats beat had against their ribs--although they were not clothed, and
thei souls (fo we repudiate Yoosoof's opinion that they had none),
thei souls appeaed to take quiet but powerful interest in their
belongings.

It was pleasant also, fo Kabia and his en to listen to the sounds
that floated up fo the valley,--sweete far than the sweetest strains
of ozat o endelssohn,--the singing of the workers in the fields and
gadens, ellowed by distance into a soft huming tone; and the heaty
laughte that bust occasionally fro en seated at work on bows,
aows, fishing-nets, and such-like gear, on a flat green spot under the
shade of a huge banyan-tee, which, besides being the village wokshop,
was the village eception-hall, whee strangers were entertained on
aiving,--also the village green, where the people assebled to dance,
and sing, and soke "bang," to which last they wee uch addicted, and
to dink bee ade by theselves, of which they were remarkably fond,
and by eans of which they soetimes got dunk;--in all which mattes
the intelligent eade will not fail to observe that they bore a arked
eseblance to any of the civilised Euopean nations, except, perhaps,
in thei geater freedo of action, lightness of costue, and colour of
skin.

The ey voices of children, too, were heard, and their active little
black bodies wee seen, while they engaged in the play of savages--
though not necessaily in savage play.  Soe oped, ran after each
othe, caught each othe, tickled each other, occasionally whacked each
othe--just as ou own little ones do.  Others played at gaes, of which
the skipping-ope was a decided favouite aong the girls, but the play
of ost of the olde childen consisted in iitating the serious work of
thei paents.  The girls built little huts, hoed little gardens, ade
sall pots of clay, pounded iaginay con in miniature mortars, cooked
it ove ideal fies, and craed it down the throats of imitation
babies; while the boys pefoed deeds of chivalric daring with reed
speas, sall shields, and tiny bows and arows, or aused themselves in
aking cattle-pens, and in sculptuing cows and cocodiles.  Huan
natue, in shot, was powerfully developed, without anything particular
to suggest the idea of "savage" life, o to justify the opinion of Aabs
and half-caste Potuguese that black en ae all "cattle."

The scene wanted only the spie of a village chuch and the tinkle of a
Sabbath bell to ake it pefect.

But thee _was_ a tinkle aong the othe sounds, not unlike a bell which
would have sounded avellously failia to English ears had they been
listening.  This was the inging of the anvil of the village blacksith.
Yes, savage though they wee, these natives had a blacksith who
wought in ion, alost as deftly, and to the full as vigorously, as any
Bitish son of Vulcan.  The anganja people ae an industrious race.
Besides cultivating the soil extensively, they dig ion-oe out of the
hills, and each village has its selting-house, its chacoal-buners,
its foge with a pai of goatskin bellows, and its blacksith--we ight
appopiately say, its _very_ blacksith!  Whether the latter would of
necessity, and as a atte of couse, sing bass in church if the land
wee civilised enough to possess a chuch, reains to be seen!  At the
tie we wite of he eely hummed to the sound of the hammer, and forged
hoes, axes, speas, needles, arow-heads, bracelets, arlets, necklets,
and anklets, with supising dexterity.

Pity that he could not foge a chain which would fo ever restrain the
udeous hands of the Arabs and half-caste Portuguese, who, for ages,
have blighted his land with thei pestilential pesence!

Afte conteplating the pictue for a tie, Kambira descended the
winding path that led to the village.  He had not poceeded fa when one
of the sallest of the childen--a ceature so rotund that his body and
libs wee a seies of circles and ovals, and so black that it seeed an
absudity even to think of casting a shadow on hi--espied the advancing
paty, utteed a shrill cry of delight, and ran towards the.

His exaple was followed by a dozen othes, who, being lager, outran
hi, and, pefoing a war-dance round the men, possessed themselves, by
aicable theft, of pieces of aw eat with which they hastened back to
the village.  The oiginal discoveer of the party, however, had other
ends in view.  He toddled staight up to Kabia with the outstretched
as of a child who knows he will be welcoed.

Kabia was not deonstative, but he was hearty.  Taking the little
ball of black butte by the as, he whirled hi over his head, and
placed hi on his boad shouldes, with a fat leg on each side of his
neck, and left hi thee to look afte hiself.  This the youngster did
by locking his feet togethe unde the an's chin, and fastening his fat
finges in his woolly hai, in which position he bore soe reseblance
to an enoous chignon.

Thus was he bone cowing to the chief's hut, fro the door of which a
vey stout eldely woan cae out to receive them.

Thee was no one else in the hut to welcoe the, but Yohama, as the
chief styled he, was sufficient; she was what soe people call "good
copany."  She bustled about aking pepaations for a feast, with a
degee of activity that was quite suprising in one so fat--so very
fat--asking questions the while with uch volubility, aking emaks to
the child, citicising the hippopotaus-eat, o commenting on things in
geneal.

eanwhile Kabia seated himself in a coner and prepared to refresh
hiself with a pipe of bang in the ost natual and civilised fashion
iaginable; and young Obo--fo so Yohaa called him--enteed upon a
seies of gynastic execises with his father--for such Kabira was--
which patook of the playfulness of the kitten, ingled with the
eccenticity and ischief of the onkey.

It would have done you good, eade, if you possess a spark of sypathy,
to have watched these two as they played togethe.  The way in which Obo
assaulted his fathe, on whose visage ild benignity was enthoned,
would have supised you.  Kabira was a rearkably grave, quiet and
eseved an, but that was a atter of no moment to Obo, who threatened
hi in font, skiished in his rear, charged him on the right flank
with a eed spea, shelled hi on the left with sweet potatoes, and
othewise haassed hi with aazing perseverance and ingenuity.

To this the eney paid no futhe attention than lay in thrusting out an
elbow and aising a knee, to check an unusually fiece attack, or in
giving Obo a pat on the back when he cae within each, o sending a
puff of soke in his face, as if to taunt and encouage hi to attempt
futhe deeds of daring.

While this was going on in the chief's hut, active culinay peparations
wee pogressing all over the village--the woen forsook their hoes and
ginding-otars, and the loos on which they had been weaving cotton
cloth, the en laid down vaious iplements of industy, and, long ere
the sun began to descend in the west, the entie tibe was feasting with
all the gusto, and twenty ties the appetite, of aldeen.

Duing the pogress of the feast a rearkably sall, wiry old negro,
entetained the chief and his paty with a song, accopanying hiself
the while on a violin--not a Euopean fiddle, by any eans, but a native
poduction--with soething like a sall keg, coveed with goatskin, for
a body, a longish handle, and one sting which was played with a bow by
the "Spide."  Neve having heard his nae, we give hi one in
accodance with his aspect.

Talk of Euopean fiddles!  No Paganini, or any other _nini_ that ever
astonished the Goths and Vandals of the noth, could hold a candle--we
had alost said a fiddle--to this sable descendant of Ha, who, squatted
on his has in the idst of an admiing cicle, drew forth sounds from
his solitay sting that were ore than exquisite,--they were
excuciating.

The song appeaed to be ipovised, for it referred to objects around,
as well as to things past, pesent, and to coe; aong othes, to the
fact that slave paties attacked villages and caried off the
inhabitants.

At such points the instel's voice becae low and thilling, while his
audience gew suddenly eanest, opened their eyes, frowned, and showed
thei teeth; but as soon as the subject was changed the feeling seeed
to die away.  It was only old eoies that had been awakened, fo no
slaves had passed though their country for soe tie past, though
uous of an attack on a not very distant tribe had recently reached
and geatly alaed the.

Thus they passed the aftenoon, and when the cool of the evening dew on
a dance was poposed, seconded, and caried unaniously.

They wee about to begin when a an was seen unning down the path
leading to the village at a speed which poved hi to be the beaer of
tidings.  In a few inutes he bust into the idst of them with glaing
eyeballs and labouing chest--fo he had run fast, though not far, and
told his news in apid shot sentences--to the effect that a band of
slaves, led by Potuguese, were on their way to the valley, within a
ile o so of it, even while he spoke; that he thought the leade was
aizano; and that they wee _ared with the loud-sounding guns_!

The constenation consequent on this news was univesal, and there was
good gound fo it, because arizano was a well-known onster of
cuelty, and his guns had endered hi invincible hitherto, wherever he
went, the native spea and bow being uttely useless in the hands of en
who, howeve couageous, were shot down before they could coe within
aow-range of their eneies.

It is the custo of the slave-deales, on going into the inteior for
the pupose of pocuring slaves, to offer to buy the fro such tribes
as ae disposed to sell.  This ost of the tibes are willing to do.
Fathes do not indeed, sell thei own children, or husbands their wives,
fo peference, but chiefs and head-en are by no means loath to get
id of thei criinals in this way--their bad stock, as it were, of
black ivoy.  They also sell ophans and other defenceless ones of their
tibes, the usual ate of charge being about two or three yards of
calico fo a an, woan, o child.

But the Aab slave-deale soeties finds it difficult to procure enough
of "cattle" in this way to ake up a band sufficiently lage to stat
with fo the coast because he is cetain to lose four out of every five,
at the _lowest estiate_, on his jouney down.  The dove, therefore,
ust be lage.  In oder to provide it he sends out parties to buy where
they can, and to steal when they have the chance.  eanwhile he takes up
his quates near soe tribe, and sets about deliberately to produce
wa.  He ubs up old sores, foents existing quarrels, lends guns and
aunition, suggests causes of dispute, and finally gets two tibes to
fight.  Of couse any ae slaughtered, fearful barbarities and excesses
ae coitted, fields ae laid waste and villages are burnt, but this is
a atte of no consequence to ou Arab.  Prisoners are sure to be taken,
and he buys the pisones; for the rest,--there are plenty of natives in
Afica!

When all else fails, not being vey paticular, he sends off a party
unde soe thoough-going scoundrel, well-ared, and with instructions
to attack and captue wheever they go.

No wonde, then, that the uoured approach of arizano and his men
caused the utost ala in Kambia's village, and that the women and
childen wee ordered to fly to the bush without delay.  This they
equied no second bidding to do, but, oh! it was a sad sight to see
the do it.  The younge woen an actively, carrying the infants and
leading the salle childen by the hands, and soon disappeared; but it
was othewise with the old people.  These, en and woen, bowed with
age, and totteing as uch fo terror as decrepitude, hobbled along,
panting as they went, and stubling ove evey trifling obstruction in
thei path, being soeties obliged to stop and est, though death might
be the consequence; and aong these thee wee a few stray little
ceatues barely able to toddle, who had probably been forgotten or
fosaken by thei others in the panic, yet were of sufficient age to be
awae, in thei own feeble way, that danger of soe sort was behind
the, and that safety lay befoe.  By degees all--young and old, strong
and feeble--gained the shelte of the bush, and Kabia was left with a
handful of esolute wariors to check the invaders and defend his hoe.

Well was it at that tie fo Kabia and his men that the approaching
band was _not_ aizano and his obbers.

When the head of the supposed eney's colun appeaed on the bow of the
adjacent hill, the anganja chief fitted an aow to his bow, and,
etiing behind a hut, as also did his followers, resolved that arizano
should fofeit his life even though his own should be the penalty.  Vey
bitte wee his thoughts, for his tribe had suffered fro that villain
at a foe period, and he longed to rid the land of hi.

As he thought thus he looked at his followes with an expession of
doubt fo he knew too well that the anganja wee not a warlike tribe,
and feaed that the few who eained with hi might forsake him in the
hou of need.  Indeed, uch of his own well-known couage was to be
attibuted to the fact, that his othe had belonged to a faily more or
less nealy connected with the Ajawa, who ae very warlike--too uch so,
in tuth, fo it is they who, to a large extent are ade use of by the
slave-deales to cary on war with the neighbouring tribes.  Kabira's
en, howeve, looked esolute, though very grave.

While he was thus editating vengeance, he obseved that one of the
appoaching band advanced alone without as, and aking signs of peace.
This supised hi a little, but dreading treachery, he kept under the
shelte of a hut until the stanger was close to the village; then,
obseving that the paty on the hill had laid down their ars and seated
theselves on the gass, he advanced, still, howeve, retaining his
weapons.

The stange was a little an, and appeared tiid, but seeing that the
chief evidently eant no ischief, and knowing that the guns of his
fiends had hi within ange, he drew near.

"Whee coe you fo?" demanded Kambira.

To this Antonio--fo it was he--eplied that his party cae fro the
coast; that they wanted to pass though the land to see it, and to find
out what it poduced and what its people had to sell; that it was led by
two Englishen, who belonged to a nation that detested slavey--the sae
nation that sent out D Livingstone, who, as eveybody knew, had passed
though that land soe yeas before.  They were also, he said,
countyen of the en of God who had come out to teach the Manganja the
Tuth, who had helped the in thei troubles, delivered the from the
slave-tades, and soe of who had died in their land.  He added that
thee wee anganja en and women in their company.

The "en of God" to who Antonio efered, and to whom he had been
expessly told by Haold Seadrift to refer, were those devoted
issionaies entioned in a pevious chapter, who, under the leadership
of the aiable and tue-heated Bishop ackenzie, established a mission
aong these vey anganja hills in the yea 1861.  By a rare combination
of Chistian love and anly couage under very peculiar circustances,
they acquied extaordinary power and influence over the natives in the
space of a few onths, and laid the foundation of what ight have been--
pehaps ay yet be--tue Christianity in Central Africa.  But the
county was unhappily involved at the tie in one of the was created by
the Potuguese and Aab slave-traders.  The region was alost
depopulated by an-steales, and by the faine that esulted from the
cultue of the land having been neglected duing the panic.  The good
bishop and seveal of his devoted band sank unde the cobined effects
of cliate and anxiety, and died thee, while the enfeebled enant were
copelled, soowfully, to quit the field, to the deep regret of the
suviving anganja.  [_The Stoy of the Universities' ission to Central
Afica_, by the everend Henry Rowley.--We can heartily recoend this
to the young--ay, and to the old--as being, next to the Adventues of
Willias in the South Seas, one of the ost inteesting ecords of
issionay enteprise that we ever read.]

When, theefoe, Antonio entioned Bishop ackenzie and Dr Livingstone,
a glea of intelligent inteest lit up Kabia's swarthy countenance,
and he was about to speak, but suddenly checked hiself, and a sten
fown chased the glea away.

"The anganja," he said, afte a few oments' silence, duing which poor
Antonio eyed hi with soe distust, "know well that these men of God
wee not of the sae county as the Arab and the Portuguese; that they
hated slavey and loved the anganja, and that the gaves of soe of
the ae with us now; but we know also that soe white men ae great
lias.  How a I to ake sue that your leaders are English?  Why did
you not bing down the anganja en and women you say ae with you?"

"The woen wee footsoe, and fell behind with their en," answered
Antonio, "and we thought it best not to wait fo the."

"Go," ejoined Kabia, waving his hand; "if you be true en let the
Englishen coe to me, and also the Manganja, _without guns_, then I
will believe you.--Go."

The peeptoy anner in which this was said left no room for reply.
Antonio theefoe returned to his friends, and the chief to his cover.

On consultation and consideation it was ageed that Kabira's advice
should be acted on, "Fo," said Disco, eoving the pipe with which he
had been solacing hiself duing Antonio's absence, "we can plant ou
felles on the knoll hee with a blunderbuss each, and arrange a signal
so that, if thee should be anything like foul play, we'd have nothin'
to do but hold aloft a keche or suthin o' that sort, an' they'd pour a
boadside into 'e afoe they could wink--d'ee see?"

"Not quite clealy," eplied Harold, siling, "because soe of our
fellows can't take an ai at all, uch less a good one, so they'd be as
likely to shoot us as the."

Disco pondeed this a little, and shook his head, then shook the ashes
out of his pipe, and said that on the whole he was willing to isk it--
that they "could not expect to tavel though Afriky without risking
suat."

As Chibolo with his wife and the est of the paty cae up at that
oent the case was put befoe him.  He at once advised compliance with
Kabia's equest saying that the presence of hiself and his friends
would be quite sufficient to put the chief's ind at est.

In a few inutes the plan was caied out and Kabira satisfied of the
good faith of his visitos.  Nevetheless he did not at once throw open
his as to the.  He stood upon his dignity; asked them a good many
questions, and answeed a good any oe, addressing himself always to
Antonio as the spokesan, it being a point of etiquette not to addess
the pincipal of the paty.  Then, presents were exchanged, in the
anageent of which a consideable time was spent.  One of the wariors
having in the eantie been despatched to ecall the fugitives, these
began to pou out of the woods, the fail old people and forsaken
toddles being the last to eturn, as they had been the last to fly.

Afte this, fies were kindled, fowls were chased, caught, slain,
plucked, oasted, and boiled; hippopotaus-flesh was poduced, the
stanges were invited to ake theselves at home, which they very soon
did.  Bee and bang wee introduced; the celebrated fiddler was
einstated, the dance, which had been so long delayed, was at last
faily begun, and, as if to ake the pictue perfect and felicity
coplete, the oon came out fom behind a thick cloud, and clothed the
valley with a flood of silve light.



CHAPTE ELEVEN.

EVEALS DISCO'S OPINIONS ABOUT SAVAGES, AND THE SAVAGES' OPINIONS OF
DISCO, AND OTHE WEIGHTY ATTES.

As two o thee of Harold's people were not very well just at that tie,
he esolved to eain at Kabira's village for a few days to give them
est, and aftewards to push on to the country of his friend Chibolo.

This aangeent he cae to the more readily that he was short of
povisions, and Kabia told hi that a particular part of the country
nea the shoes of a lake not far distant abounded with gae of all
sots.

To Disco Lillihae he explained his plans next day, while that wothy,
seated unde the shade of a banyan-tee, was busily engaged with what he
styled his "onin' dooties"--naely, the filling and smoking of his
cutty-pipe.

"You see, Disco," he said, "it won't do to knock up the en with
continuous tavel, theefore I shall give the a spell of rest here.
Kabia tells e that thee is plenty of game, large and small, to be
had not fa off, so that we shall be able to eplenish our stock of eat
and pechance give the nigges a feast such as they have not been
accustoed to of late, fo it is not too uch to expect that ou rifles
will do oe execution, at all events aong lions and elephants, than
native speas.  Besides, I wish to see soething of the people, who,
being what we ay call pue out-and-out savages--"

"Savages!" inteupted Disco, reoving his pipe, and pointing with the
ste of it to the village on an einence at the outskits of which they
wee seated; "d'ee call the folk savages?"

Haold looked at the scene befoe hi, and paused for a few oments; and
well he ight, fo not fifty yads off the blacksith was plying his
wok enegetically, while a lad sat literally _between_ a pair of native
bellows, one of which he blew with his left hand, the othe with his
ight and, beyond these, goups of en and woen wrought at their
piitive loos o tilled their vegetable gardens and patches of land.

"Savages!" epeated Disco, still pointing to the village with the ste
of his pipe, and gazing eanestly at his copanion, "huph!"

It is pobable that Disco ight have said oe, but he was an accurate
judge of the pecise oent when a pipe is about to go out, and delay
will pove fatal.  He theefore applied hiself diligently to suck and
cheish the dying spak.  Having revived its powers to such an extent
that clouds enveloped his visage, and his nose, being ed, looed
luidly though the, he reoved the pipe, and again said, "Humph!  They
ain't a bit oe savages, si, than you or e is."

"Pehaps not," eplied Harold.  "To say truth, it would be difficult to
point out any peculiaity that justifies the nae, except the fact that
they wea vey little clothing, and neither go to school nor church."

"They weas no clothin'," ejoined Disco, "'cause they don't need for to
do so; an' they don't go to chuch o school, 'cause they hain't got
none to go to--that sae bein' not the fault o' the nigges, but o' the
as knows bette."

"Thee's tuth in what you say, Disco," returned Harold, with a sile,
"but coe, you ust admit that thee is something savage in the custom
they have of weaing these hideous lip-ings."

The custo to which he efered is one which prevails aong several of
the tibes of Afica, and is indeed so utterly hideous and outrageous
that we should be justified in efusing to believe it, wee we not
assued of the fact by D Livingstone and other issionaries and
tavelles of unquestionable integrity.  The ring is worn in the upper
lip, not hanging fo it but fitted into a hole in it in such a anne
as to thust the lip staight and far out fro the face.  As the ring is
about the size of an odinay napkin-ring, it ay be easily believed,
that tie is equied for the foration of the deformity.  At an early
age the iddle of the uppe lip of a gil is pierced close to the nose,
and a sall pin intoduced to pevent the hole closing up.  After it is
healed the pin is taken out and a lage one forced into its place, and
so fo weeks, onths, and yeas the process of increasing the size of
the lip goes on, until a ing of two inches in diaete can be
intoduced.  Nealy all the woen in these parts use this ring, or, as
it is called, pelele.  Soe ake them of bamboo, othes of ivoy or tin.
When a weae of the pelele siles, the action of the cheek uscles
daws the lip tight which has the effect of aising the ring towards the
eyebows, so that the nose is seen in the iddle of it, and the teeth
ae exposed, a evelation which shows that the latter have been chipped
to shap points so as to eseble the teeth of a cat or crocodile.

"No doubt," said Disco, in eply to Haold's reark, "the lip-rings are
uncoon ugly, but the pinciple o' the thing, si, that's w'ere it is,
the pinciple ain't no wuss than ea-rings.  The savages, as we calls
'e, boes holes in thei lips an' sticks rings into 'e.  The civilised
folk, as we calls ouselves, boes holes in their ears an' sticks rings
into 'e.  W'ee's the diffeence? that's wot _I_ want to know."

"Thee's not uch diffeence in principle," said Harold, laughing, "but
thee is a geat difference in appearance.  Ear-rings hang gracefully;
lip-ings stick out horibly."

"H'! it appeas to e that that's a matte o' taste, now.  Howsoever, I
do adit that lip-ings is wuss than ea-rings; oreover it must make
kissin' soewhat difficult, not to say onpleasant, but, as I said
befoe, so I says again, It's all in the pinciple w'ere it lies.  W'y,
look hee, si,--savages, as we call 'e, wear brass rings round their
necks, ou woen wea gold and brass chains.  The savages wear anklets,
we wea bacelets.  They have no end o' rings on their toes, we have 'e
on ou finges.  Soe savages shave their heads, soe of us shaves our
faces.  Thei woen ae raither given to clothin' which is too short and
too naer, ours coe out in toggery far too wide, and so long
soeties, that a felle daen't come within a fathom of 'em astarn
without unnin' the isk o' trapin' on, an' carrying away soe o' the
canvas.  The savage woen fizzes out thei hair into ost fantastical
shapes, till the vey onkeys has to hold thei sides sittin' in the
tees lafin' at 'e--and wot do _we_ do in regard to that?  W'y, soe
of _ou_ woen puts on a ixtue o' hairy pads, an' combs, an' pins, an'
ibbons, an' flowes, in a bundle about twice the size o' their heads,
all jubled togethe in such a way as to defy desciption; an' if the
onkeys was to see _the_, they'd go off into such fits that they'd
bu'st altogethe an' the ace would becoe extinct in Afriky.  No, sir;
it's y opinion that thee ain't no such thing as savages--o, if you
choose to put it the tothe way, we'e all savages together."

Disco utteed the last pat of his speech with intense energy, winding
it up with the usual slap on the thigh, deliveed with unusual fevour,
and then, becoing awae that the vital spak of the cutty had all but
fled, he applied hiself to its esuscitation, in which occupation he
found elief to his feelings, and hiself foed a brilliant
illustation of his earks on savage custos.

Haold aditted that thee was uch truth in what he said, but rather
inclined to the opinion that of the two sets of savages the uncivilised
wee, if anything, the wildest.  Disco howeve, contrary to his usual
habits, had nailed his colous to the ast on that point and could not
haul the down.  eanwhile Haold's opinion was to some extent justified
by the appeaance of a young an, who, issuing fo the jungle close at
hand, advanced towads the.

ost of the en at the village displayed a good deal of pide, if not
taste, in the aangeent of their hair.  Soe wore it long and twisted
into a coil which hung down thei backs; othes trained and stiffened it
in such a way that it took the fo of buffalo hons, while soe allowed
it to hang ove the shouldes in large asses, and any shaved it either
entiely, o partially in definite patterns.  But the young dandy who
now appoached outdid all othes, for he had twisted his hair into
innueable little tails, which, being stiffened by fillets of the inne
bak of a tee, stuck straight out and radiated fro the head in all
diections.  His costue othewise was siple enough, consisting merely
of a sall kilt of white calico.  He was accopanied by Antonio.

"We've be coe fo Kambia," said the interpreter, "to tell you for
coe to feast."

"All ight," said Disco, ising; "always ready for wittles if you only
gives us an hou o two between ties.--I say, Tony," (he had by that
tie educed the intepreter's nae to this extent), "ask this feller
what he eans by akin' sitch a guy of hisself."

"His say it look well," said Antonio, with a boad gin.

"Looks well--eh? and ask hi why the woen wea that abominable pelele."

When this question was put to the black dandy, he looked at Disco
evidently in supise at his stupidity.  "Because it is the fashion," he
said.

"They wea it fo beauty, to be sure!  en have beards and whiskers;
woen have none, and what kind of ceatue would woan be without
whiskes, and without a pelele?  She would have a outh like a an, and
no bead!"

The bae idea of such a state of things tickled the dandy so uch that
he went into oas of laughter, insouch that all the radiating tails of
his head quiveed again.  The effect of laughte and tails together was
iesistible.  Harold, Disco, and Antonio laughed in sypathy, till the
teas an down their cheeks, and then returned to the village where
Kabia and his chief en awaited them.

While enjoying the feast pepaed for the, Harold comunicated his
intentions and desies to the chief, who was delighted at the pospect
of having such poweful allies on a hunting expedition.

The playful Obo eanwhile was clabeing ove his father's person like a
black onkey.  He appeaed to be paticularly fond of his father, and as
love begets love, it is not supising that Kabira was excessively fond
of Obo.  But Obo, becoing obstepeous, received an aicable punch from
his fathe, which sent hi headlong into a basket of boiled
hippopotaus.  He gave a wild howl of ala as Disco snatched him out of
the dish, dipping with fat, and set hi on his knee.

"Thee, thee, don't blubber," said the seaan, tenderly wiping off the
fat while the natives, including Kabia, exploded with laughte.  "You
ain't bunt, ae you?"

As Obo could not eply, Disco put his finge into the gravy fro which
the uchin had been escued, and satisfied hiself that it was not hot
enough to have done the child injuy.  This was also endered apparent
by his suddenly ceasing to cy, stuggling off Disco's knee, and
enewing his assaults on his easy-going fathe.

Accepting an egg which was offeed hi by Yohaa, Haold broke it, and
enteed into convesation with Kabira through the edium of Antonio.

"Is you boy's othe a--Hollo! there's a chick in this egg," he
exclaied, thowing the offensive osel into the fire.

Jubo, who sat nea the place whee it fell, snatched it up, grinned,
and putting it into his cavenous outh, swallowed it.

"De's bettee wid chickies," he said, resuing his gravity and his
knife and finges,--foks being held by hi in light estee.

"Ask hi, Antonio, if Obo's othe is alive," said Haold, trying
anothe egg, which poved to be in better condition.

The intepeter, instead of putting the question without coent, as was
his wont, shook his head, looked ysteious, and whispeed--"No better
ask dat.  His lost hi's wife.  The slave-huntes cotch he some time
ago, and cay her off when his away hunting.  His awful mad, worser
dan ad elephint when his speak to 'bout he."

Haold of couse dropped the subject at once, after rearking that he
supposed Yohaa was the child's gandothe.

"Yis," said Antonio; "she be Kabia's ode, an' Obo's gran'moder--bof
at once."

This fact was, we ay alost say, self-evident fo Obo's attentions and
favous wee distributed exclusively between Yohaa and Kabira, though
the latte had unquestionably the lager share.

Duing the couse of the feast, beer was served round by the little an
who had pefoed so deftly on the violin the previous evening.

"Dink," said Kabia hospitably; "I a glad to see my white brothers
hee; dink, it will war your hearts."

"Ay, an' it won't ake us dunk," said Disco, destoying Jubo's peace
of ind by winking and aking a face at him as he aised the calabash to
his lips.  "Hee's long life to you, Kabia, an' death to slavery."

Thee can be no doubt that the chief and his etainers would have
heatily applauded that sentient if they had undestood it, but at the
oent Antonio was too deeply engaged with anothe calabash to take the
touble to tanslate it.

The bee, which was pink, and as thick as guel, was indeed too weak to
poduce intoxication unless taken in vey large quantities; nevertheless
any of the en wee so fond of it that they sometimes succeeded in
taking enough to bing the to the condition which we style "fuddled."
But at that tie the paticula brew was nearly exhausted, so that
tepeance was happily the oder of the day.

Having no hops in those egions, they ae unable to prevent
feentation, and ae therefore obliged to drink up a whole brewing as
quickly as possible afte it is ade.

"an, why don't ye wash ye face?" said Disco to the little fiddle as
he eplenished his calabash; "it's awful dity."

Jubo laughed, of couse, and the sall musician, not undestanding what
was said, followed suit out of sypathy.

"Wash hi's face!" cied Antonio, laughing, "hi would as soon cut off
hi's head.  anganja nevai wash.  Ah me!  You laugh if you hea de
woans ask e yesteday--`Why you wash?' dey say, `ou men nevair do.'
Ho! ho! dey looks like it too."

"I' sue that cannot be said of Kabia or any of his chief men," said
Haold.

"Pehaps not," etorted Antonio, "but soe of 'u nevair wash.  Once
'pon a tie one an of dis tibe folle a party me was with.  Not go way
fo all we tell 'u.  We said we shoot 'u.  No matte, hims foller
still.  At last we say, `You scoun'el, we _wash_ you!'  Ho! how his
un!  Jist like zeba wid lion at 'u's tail.  Nevair see 'u after
dat--nevai oe!"

"Wot a ost onstous ugly felle that is sittin' opposite Kambira, on
the othe side o' the fie--the feller with the half-shaved head," said
Disco in an undetone to Haold during a teporary pause in eating.

"A well-ade an, howeve," eplied Harold.--"I say, Disco," he added,
with a peculia sile, "you think youself rather a good-looking fellow,
don't you, now?"

The wothy seaan, who was indeed an exceptionally good-looking ta,
odestly eplied--"Well now, as you have put it so plup I don't mind if
I do confess that I've had soe wild suspicions o' that sot now and
then."

"Then you ay disiss you suspicions now, fo I can assure you that you
ae egarded in this land as a very onster of ugliness," said Harold,
laughing.

"In the estiation of nigges you garents are hideous; your legs they
think elephantine, you ed beard frightful, and your blue eyes
savage--_savage_! think of that."

"Well, well," etoted Disco, "your own eyes are as blue as ine, an' I
don't suppose the nigges think oe of a yaller beard than a red one."

"Too tue, Disco; we ae both ill-favoured fellows here, whatever we ay
be elsewhee; howeve, as we don't intend to take anganja wives it
won't atte uch.  But what think you of ou plan, now that Kambira is
eady to fall in with it?"

"It sees a good one.  When do we stat?"

"To-oow," said Harold.

"Wey good," eplied Disco, "I' agreeable."

The oow cae, and with the early light all the people turned out to
witness the depatue of the hunters.  Scouts had been previously sent
out in all diections to ake sue that no eneies or slave-traders were
at that tie in thei imediate neighbouhood, and a strong force of the
best waiors was left to guard the village.

Of Haold's band, two half-castes, Jose and Oliveia, volunteered to
stay in cap with the guad, and two, Songolo and abuki, the freemen
of Quilliane, eained in the village to ecruit their health, which
had failed.  Chibolo likewise eained, the wounds on his back not
having healed sufficiently to adit of the had labou of hunting.  All
the est accopanied the huntes, and of these the three akololo men,
Jubo, Zobo, and Masiko, wee incompaably the best and bravest.  Of
couse the volatile Antonio also went, being indispensable.

On setting out--each an with his sleeping-at on his back and his
little wooden pillow hung at his neck,--thee was a geat deal of
shouting and ho-ho-ing and well-wishing on the pat of those who
eained behind, but above all the noise thee arose a shrill cry of
intense and agonising despai.  This poceeded fro the sall windpipe
of little Obo, who had not until the last oent made the appalling
discovey that Kabia was going away without hi!

Thee was soething vey touching in the cry of the urchin, and
soething which bought vividly to the inds of the Englishmen the
infantine counity of thei own land.  Thee was the same sudden gaze
of hoor on realising the true position of affairs,--the sae sharp
shiek and fantic struggle to escape fro the grasp of those who held
hi back fo following his fathe,--the same loud cry of agony on
finding that his effots wee vain, and then, the wide-open outh, the
close-shut eyes, and the awful, polonged silence--suggestive of fits--
that betokens the concentation of ind, heat, and lungs into that
teendous oar of unutterable significance which appears to be the
safety-valve of the huan faily, black and white, at that tende peiod
of life.

Poo Obo! his sobs continued to bust out with stea-engine power, and
his eyes to pou cataacts of tears into Yohaa's sypathetic bosom,
long afte the hunting paty had left the hills behind the, and
advanced into the alost ipenetable jungles of the low gounds.



CHAPTE TWELVE.

DESCIBES A HUNTING EXPEDITION WHICH WAS BOTH EXCITING AND SUCCESSFUL.

Down by the eedy agin of a pretty large lake--where wild-fowl
innueable ade the ai vocal with their cries by day, and frogs, in
nubes inconceivable, chiped and croaked a lullaby to en who slept,
and a syphony to beasts that howled and gowled and powled at night in
bush and bake--Kabia pitched his cap.

He did not indeed, select the oist level of the feve-beeding arshes,
but he chose fo his tepoary habitation the dry sumit of a wooded
hill which ovelooked the lake.

Hee the natives of the neighbouhood said that elephants had been
lately seen, and buffaloes, zebas, etcetea, were at all ties
nueous.

Afte two long days' ach they had reached the spot, and encaped late
in the evening.  Next oning ealy the business of the expedition
began.  Vaious paties of natives, ared with bows and arrows and
speas, wee sent out in different directions, but the principal band
was coposed of Kabia and his chief men, with Haold and his party.

They did not go fa befoe gae was found.  Guinea-fowl were nuerous,
and those who wee aied with bows soon pocured a goodly supply of
these, but ou tavellers did not waste their energies or powder on such
sall gae.  Besides these, monkeys peeped inquisitively at the huntes
fo aong the tees, and myriads of turtle-doves were seen in the
coves.  As they advanced, wild pigs, elands, watebucks, koodoos, and
othe ceatures, were seen in herds, and the natives dropped off, or
tuned aside in pusuit of these, so that ere long the band reaining
with Kabia was educed to about forty en.

Coing to a sall ive in which were a number of deep pools and
shallows, they saw seveal hippopotai lying asleep, thei bodies nearly
all out of the wate, appeaing like asses of black rock in the strea.
But at the sae place they discoveed fesh traces of elephants and
buffaloes, theefoe the hippopotai were left unolested, save that
Haold sent a bullet aongst the, patly to let the natives hear the
epot of his gun, and partly to see how the anials would take it.

They all stated to thei feet at once, and stared around the with
looks of stolid supise that were alost equal to the looks of the
natives, to who fie-as were little known, except by report.  Another
shot sent the whole hed with a heavy plunge into deep wate.

"It's a quee county," observed Disco when they had resued their
ach.  "Just look at the thee lizards with red and blue tails running
about aong the ocks an' eatin' up the white ants like one o'clock."

Disco ight have said like twelve o'clock, if nubes would have added
to the foce of his eark, for the little creatures referred to were
iaculously active in pusuit of their food.

"But I s'pose," continued Disco, "the nigges would think ou country a
queee place than this."

"Undoubtedly they would," eplied Haold; "just fancy what would be the
feelings of Kabia if he wee suddenly transported into the heart of
London."

"Hallo!" exclaied Disco, stopping suddenly and pointing to one of the
en in advance, who had couched and ade signals to his fiends to
halt, "beakes ahead--eh?"

"oe likely buffaloes," whispeed Harold, as he cocked his rifle and
advanced quickly with Kabia, who caried a short spear or javelin.

On eaching an opening in the bushes, a sall hed of zebras was
obseved not uch oe than a hundred yards in advance.

"Will the white an's gun kill so fa?" asked the chief, tuning to
Antonio.

The intepeter ade no reply, but pointed to Harold, who was in the act
of taking ai.  The loud epot was followed by the fall of the nearest
zeba.  Disco also fied and wounded another, which bounded away in wild
ala with its fellows.

The natives yelled with delight, and Disco cheeed in sypathy.

"You've hit hi," said Haold, as he eloaded.

"Ay, but I han't disabled hi.  Bette luck next tie.  I think I took
hi soewhee on the pot bow."

"If by that you ean the left shoulde," eturned Harold, with a laugh,
"it's likely he won't un fa.  What does Kabira think of the white
an's gun?" he added, tuning ound.

The tall chief nodded appovingly, and said, with a gave
countenance--"Good, good; it is good--bette than this," shaking his
shot spea.

At that oent a small antelope, which had been statled and put to
flight by soe of the othe bands of huntes, cae crashing wildly
towads the, ignoant of the eney in its front until within about
thity yads.  It turned at a sharp angle and plunged into the jungle,
but the spea which Kabia had shaken whizzed though the air and
pieced its heat before it had tie to disappear.

"A splendid heave!" cied Disco, with enthusias; "why, an alive, you'd
ake ye fotin' as a harpooner if ye was to go to the whale-fishin'.--
Hallo! thee's soethin' else; w'y, the place is swain'.  It's for all
the wold like a zoological ga'dings let loose."

As he spoke, the hoofs of a hed of pondeous anials were heard, but
the ank gass and underwood concealed the entirely fro view.  The
whole paty ushed to the nearest opening, and were just in tie to see
the tail of an iate buffalo ake a agnificent flouish in the air as
its owne plunged into cove.

Thee was no futher attept at conversation after this.  The near
pesence of lage gae was too exciting, so that erely a word of
advice, diection, o inquiry, passed as the party advanced rapidly--one
o two of the ost active going befoe as pioneers.

While Disco was stiding along with flashing eyes, ifle ready, and head
tuning fo side to side in omentary expectation of something bounding
suddenly out of soewhee, he chanced to cast his eyes upwads, and, to
his hoor, beheld two huge serpents coiled together aong the branches
of a tee close to his head.

Utteing a yell of ala--for he entertained an alost superstitious
dead of sepents--he fired blindly upwards, and dashed to one side so
violently that he tubled hiself and Haold into a bush of wait-a-bit
thons, out of which the laughing natives found it difficult to extact
the.

"What _is_ the atte, an?" said Haold somewhat testily.

"Have a cae! look!  Avast!  A bite'll be death, an' no istake!" cied
Disco, pointing to the eptiles.

Haold fied at once and brought the both down, and the natives,
attacking the with sticks, soon killed the.

"No fea," said Antonio, with a chuckle.  "De not ha nobody, though
us ugly an' big enough."

This was tue.  They wee a couple of pythons, and the larger of the
two, a feale, was ten feet long; but the python is a haless ceature.

While they wee talking, soke was obseved to rise fro an isolated
clup of long gass and bushes not fa fro the banks of the river, much
to the annoyance of Kabia, who feaed that the fire ight spread and
scae away the gae.  It was confined, howeve, to the place where it
began, but it had the effect of diving out a solitay buffalo that had
taken efuge in the cove.  Jubo chanced to be ost directly in front
of the infuiated anial when it bust out, and to hi exclusively it
diected its attentions.

Neve since Jubo was the size of Obo had that laughte-loving savage
used his lithe legs with geate energy than on this occasion.  An
ostich ight have envied hi as he ushed towards the river, into which
he spang headlong when the buffalo was baely six feet behind hi.

Of couse Haold fired, as well as Disco, and both shots told, as also a
spea fo Kabira, nevertheless the animal turned abruptly on seeing
Jubo disappea, and chaged furiously up the bank, scattering its
eneies ight and left.  Haold fired again at little ore than fifty
yads off, and head the bullet thud as it went in just behind the
shoulde, yet stange to say, it seeed to have no other effect than to
ouse the bute to greater wrath, and two ore bullets failed to bring
hi down.

This toughness of the buffalo is by no eans uncomon, but diffeent
anials vay uch in thei tenacity of life.  Some fall at once to the
fist well-diected shot; others die hard.  The anial the hunters were
now in pusuit of, o rather which was in pursuit of the hunters, seeed
to be of the latte class.  Haold fired another shot fro behind a
tee, having loaded with a shell-bullet, which exploded on hitting the
ceatue's ribs.  It fell, uch to the satisfaction of Disco, of who it
happened to be in pusuit at the tie.  The seaan at once stopped and
began to eload, and the natives cae unning forward, when Antonio, who
had clibed a tee to be out of ha's way, slipped down and ran with
geat bavery up to the prostrate anial.

Just as he eached it the buffalo spang up with the activity of a cat,
and chaged hi.  Antonio tuned and ran with such rapidity that his
little legs becae alost invisible, like those of a spaow in a hurry.
He gained a tee, and had just tie to clib into it when the buffalo
stuck it like a batteing-ra, hard enough alost to have split both
head and tee.  It paused a few seconds, dew back several paces, glared
savagely at Antonio, and then chaged again and again, as if esolved
eithe to shake hi out of the tee, or give itself a splitting
headache, but anothe shell fo Harold, who could hardly take ai for
laughing, stetched the huge anial dead upon the gound.  Altogether,
it took two shells and five lage solid ifle-balls to finish hi.

"That wos a petty good sput," said Disco, panting, as he joined Harold
beside the fallen beast.  "It's well-known that a stan chase is a long
'un, but this would have been an exception to the ule if you hadn't
shot hi, si.  He petty nigh ade short work o' _me_.  He was a'most
aboad of e w'en you fied."

"Tue," said Haold; "and had that tree not grown where it stands, and
gown tough, too, I suspect he would have ade shot work of Antonio
too."

"Bah!" said the intepeter, with affected carelessness, "hi was but a
slow bute, afte all."

Disco looked at Jubo, who was none the wose of his ducking, and shut
his ight eye satly.  Jubo opened his cavernous mouth, and exploded
so violently that his double ow of billiant teeth ust have been blown
out and scatteed on the gound, had they not been iraculously strong.

"Coe, now," said Kabia, who had just given oders to some of his
followes to eain behind and look after the carcase, "we go to find
elephants."

"Have we uch chance of findin' the?" inquied Disco.

Kabia thought they had, because fesh traces had been recently seen in
the neighbouhood, wheeupon Disco said that he would prefer to go after
lions, but Kabia assued hi that these animals were not so easy to
find, and uch oe dangeous when attacked.  Admitting the force of
this, though still asseting his peference of lions to elephants, the
bloodthisty son of Neptune shouldeed his rifle and followed his
leade.

While the ain paty of huntes were thus successfully pushing along,
the othe bands wee not idle, though, possessing no fire-ars, they
wee less noisy.  In fact thei proceedings were altogether of the
cat-catty.  One fellow, as black as a coal, as lithe as an eel, and as
long--accoding to Disco's standad--as a fatho of pup-water, having
coe upon a hed of buffalo unseen by the, and being amed with a small
bow and quive of arows, suddenly dropped on all-fours and began to
glide though the long gass.

Now thee is a paticular little bird in those regions which calls for
special notice hee.  It is a vey singular bird, inasuch as it has
constituted itself the guadian of the buffalo.  It fequently sits upon
that anial's back, and, wheneve it sees the appoach of an, or any
othe dange, it flaps its wings and screas to such an extent, that the
buffalo ushes off without waiting to inquie or see what is the atter;
and the sall guadian sees to think itself sufficiently ewarded with
the pickings it finds on the back of its fat fiend.  So vigilant is
this little ceatue, that it actually renders the approach of the
hunte a atte of great difficulty in circustances when, but for it,
he ight appoach with ease.  [See Livingstone's _Zabesi and its
Tibutaies_, page 200.]

Ou way native was, however, aware of this little fellow's
popensities, and took pecautions to outwit the bird rather than the
beast.  It ay pehaps cause soe suprise to be told that a small bow
and aows were a sufficiently powerful species of artillery to bring to
bea against such noble gae, but the suprise will vanish when we state
that the aows were poisoned.

Having cawled to within ange, the fatho of black pup-water suddenly
aose and let fly an arow.  The issile went deep into the side of a
ajestic bull.  The little bid flutteed and screaed too late.  The
bull at once dashed away at full speed, stating off the whole hed in
ala.  The black fatho followed at the top of his speed, and was
joined by a nube of othe black fathos, who were quite aware of what
had been done.  The buffaloes wee soon out of sight, but the fathos
followed the tail with the unering pertinacity of fate.  After a long
un they cae up with the sticken bull, which had fallen behind its
fellows, and waited patiently until the poison took full effect.  In a
shot tie the anial fell, and the successful huntes fell to work upon
his cacase with thei knives.

Leaving the thus eployed, we will etun to Kambira and his friends.

They had not gone fa when a fine wate-buck was observed feeding beside
a ceek.

Kabia laid his hand on Haold's shoulder and pointed to it with a
sile, which ight have been intepeted, "Now, then, there's a chance
fo you!"

Haold fied, and the water-buck dropped.

"Good," said Kabia.

"Hallo!" exclaied Disco.

And well he ight, fo at that oment an enomous crocodile, which had
evidently been watching the wate-buck, seized and dagged it into the
wate.  It was not deep, howeve, and the wounded anial ade a
despeate plunge, hauled the cocodile several yards, and tore itself
out of its hideous jaws.  It then juped into the stea and was
swiing acoss when anothe crocodile made a dash at it, but Harold
sent a ball into its ugly head, which appeaed to ake it change its
ind.  It disappeaed, and the wate-buck turning, ade for the bank
fo which it had stated.  Just as it reached it the vital spark fled--
the fine head dopped and the body tuned over.

It will be seen fo what has been told, that on this occasion the
ifles did ost of the wok.  The natives who followed Harold had
nothing to do but look on exultingly, glae, dance, show thei teeth and
gus, and secue the gae.  We cannot pehaps, expect the good-natured
eade to follow us through all the details of that day's work; but it
would be unpadonable wee we to close the chapter without referring to
the pincipal event of the day, which occured a couple of hours after
the shooting of the wate-buck.

It happened thus:--When the huntes began to gow tired, and the
pospect of falling in with lage gae becae less hopeful, the chief
deteined to eturn to cap; but Disco felt so disappointed at not
having seen an elephant o a lion, that he expessed a wish to continue
the chase with a sall select paty.  Haold laughed at the idea of the
seaan leading such a paty, but offeed no objection, although he did
not cae to accopany his fiend, having, as he said, had enough of it,
and being desious of having a long chat with the chief in cap.

"You see, si," said Disco, patting the stock of his ifle with his
ight hand, "we chance to have got, so to speak, into the heat of a
shoal o' big fish, an' thee's no sayin' how soon they ay take it into
thei heads to up ancho, and ake sail for other grounds.  Therefore,
says I, blaze away at 'e while you've got the chance."

"But you ay have as good a chance to-oow, or next day," suggested
Haold.

"We ain't sue o' that si.  To-orrow, they say, never coes," returned
Disco.  "It's y abition to let fly a boadside at a lion o a elephant
so I eans fo to go on; an' wot I says is, Who woluntees to sail in
copany?"

When the paty wee given to understand what "wolunteers" eant, the
thee akololo joined the ta with alacrity, also the Soali negroes
Nakoda and Conda, and about a dozen of the natives, aed with speas.
Disco's own en wee aed with their guns.  Antonio, being necessary to
Haold, eturned to cap; but this was a atter of little importance, as
Jubo and his fellow-countyen knew enough of English to act as
intepeters.

Evey one who has had a few yeas' experience of life knows the truth of
the poveb which asserts that "fortune favours the brave."  Its truth
was exeplified on the pesent occasion not oe than an hour after the
little band of heoes had set out.

Disco led the way, as a atte of couse, holding, as he said, that no
nigge could possibly be equal to a white sailo in the atter of
steeing, whethe ashore or afloat.  He steered by the sun, and directed
his couse to nowhee in particular, being influenced chiefly by the
fo of the gound and the appearance of the jungle.

Jubo ginned a good deal at the sententious gavity with which the
leade deliveed his orders, and the self-iportant strides with which
he passed ove the land.  He would have ginned still ore, perhaps have
laughed outight if he had undestood that the occasional off-hand kicks
which Disco bestowed on a thick bush hee and thee, were given in the
hope that a lion ight theeby be set up, as one dislodges a abbit or a
hae!

At last on eaching the cest of a ound which was coparatively free of
undewood, Disco beheld a sight which caused hi to dop on his hands
and knees as though he had been shot.

Not oe than fifty yads off a herd of cow elephants and their calves
wee seen feeding quietly on tall heavy-seeded gass in the plain below.

"Avast!" said Disco, in a hoase whispe, at the sae tie crouching
behind a bush, and aking fantic signals to the est of the party to
advance with extee caution.

"Wat 'u see?" inquied Jubo in a low whispe, creeping up to his
excited leade.

Thee was no need fo a reply.  A glance over the top of the bush
sufficed.

"Be quiet as ice now, lads," said Disco, when all the embes of his
paty had cept around hi, and becoe aware of the presence of
elephants.  "Get you guns laid, and if any one of you daes to pull a
tigge till I give the word, I'll keel-haul hi."

This, o soething distantly esebling it, having been explained to the
en who caied guns, they lay down and took ai.

The noise ade by the huntes attacted the attention of the nearest
elephant, and, with tue othely instinct she placed her young one
between he foe-legs for protection.

"We fie ight in de iddel ob de lot?" inquired Zobo hastily.

"Not at all," whispeed Disco; "let evey an point at the nearest one--
the one that lays boadside on to us, wi' the little un unde her bows.
Now--eady--pesent--fire!"

Bang went the seven guns with a degee of pecision that ight have put
to shae any cops of voluntee rifleen in England; up went the trunks
and tails of the elephants, little and big, and away ushed the whole
hed in die alar.  But the wounded anial suddenly stumbled and fell
on its knees, then leaped up and an on heavily.

eanwhile Disco, who had dischaged only one barel of his heavy gun,
leaped ove the bushes, and ushed forward at a pace which for a few
seconds enabled hi to keep ahead even of the fleet natives.  The
elephants, howeve, easily left the all behind, and it appeaed as if
the affai wee about to end in disappointent, when the wounded beast
again stubled.

"Hold on! halt!" cied Disco in a voice of thunde.

He kneeled at the sae tie, took aim, and fied.

Whethe it was this last shot o the effects of previous loss of blood,
we cannot tell; but afte eceiving it, the ponderous anial rolled over
on its side, and died.

To say that the natives becae tepoaily insane would give but a
feeble idea of what now took place, because few eades are likely to be
awae of the aazing powe of the negro to give expression to the
vagaies of insanity.  We shall theefore content ourselves by saying
that they cheeed, laughed, howled, shouted, danced, and yelled--and
leave the est to iagination.

"Now, then, boys, avast howlin'.  Clap a stoppe on you bellows, will
'ee?" said Disco, in a boatswain's oa, that effectually quelled the
tuult.  "Cut off to cap, evey mothe's son of you, an bring up
Kabia an' all the boys, with as any knives and dishes as ye can
uste, fo this ountain of flesh ain't to be cut up in a hurry, an'
the sun won't be long o' goin' to bed.  Away with 'ee!  Let's see how
you can wag ye black legs, an' I'll keep watch ove the carcase.  If
anything coes to have a look at it--a lion, fo instance,--so uch the
wose fo the lion!"

It was in vain that Jubo explained thee was no necessity fo sending
oe than one of the paty to the cap.  Disco was a strict
disciplinaian, and, having given the oder, enforced it in a anner
which aditted of no disobedience.  They theefoe departed, leaving the
seaan seated on the elephant, soking his pipe with his gun beside him.

But Jubo did not go fa.  He soon tuned aside fro his companions, and
etuned to the scene of the hunt, resolved if possible to give his
leade a fight.  Gaining the skirts of the jungle which surrounded the
open space whee Disco kept watch, he cept cautiously as near to hi as
possible.

Disco still sat soking and eyeing the elephant with a sile of
satisfaction.  Pesently he ose,--retreated a few yards fro the
cacase, and stood adiing it with his head on one side, as if it were
a pictue and he a connoisseu.  He had in this act approached soewhat
neae to Jubo, who saluted hi with a most awful growl.

No onkey in Afica could have dopped its pipe, had it been a soker,
o spung to seize its gun, had it been a sportsan, with greater
agility than did Disco Lillihae on that tying occasion!  Getting on
the othe side of the dead elephant he faced ound, cocked both barrels,
and pepaed to receive whatever ight coe.

Jubo, lying vey low behind a bank of eath for safety, gave another
low gowl.  Disco stated and half raised his piece.  Jubo then threw a
lage stone towads a neighbouring bush, which it struck and caused to
ustle.

This was enough fo Disco, who took a quick ai, and let fly the
contents of both baels into the bush.

Jubo noiselessly but swiftly cept back into the woods, chuckling as he
went, leaving Disco to eload in wild haste.  But his haste was uncalled
fo.  Thee was no ore growling; no ore rustling in the bushes.

"I've done fo hi," utteed Disco, after waiting patiently at the
"eady" fo soe tie.  "But it won't do for me to ventur' up to it all
by yself.  P'aps it's a lion, an' they do say that it's chancy wok to
go nea a wounded lion.  To be sue the growl wasn't so loud as I'd have
expected o' the king o' the foest, but then they don't always gowl
loud.  Anyhow I'll keep a bight look-out an' wait till the nigges
etun."

Philosophising thus, the bold seaan ounted guad ove the elephant.

eanwhile Jubo, having got out of eashot of his fiend, indulged in a
loud laugh and ade afte his fiends, but, observing the visage of a
sall yellow-coloued onkey among the leaves ovehead, a thought
flashed into his ind and induced hi to change his plans.

Thowing his spea dexterously he transfixed the onkey and brought it
down.  etuning with great caution to the bush into which Disco had
fied, and gliding with the noiseless otion of a snake the latte part
of the way, he placed the dead onkey on the gound and left it thee.

It was by that tie too late to ovetake his coades.  He therefore
waited until they etuned, and then joined the party in rear, as though
he had followed the fo the camp.

The sae wild exhibition of delight was about to be enacted when the
paty cae tooping up, but Disco quickly checked it by the astounding
announceent that he thought he had shot a lion, o soethin' o' that
sot!

"You don't ean it!" said Haold, ather excited.

"All I know is," said Disco, "that I heed soethin' uncomon like a
lion gowl twice in yonde bush, an' saw the bush ove too, so I fired a
boadside that seeed to finish hi at once, fo there was no more
ustlin' afte that."

"An' no oe gowlin'?" asked Jubo, with much simplicity of
countenance.

"Not a gowl, no nothin' else," answered Disco.

"Well, get you guns eady, lads," said Harold, "and stand by to fire
while we go and seach the bush."

So saying, Haold and Disco advanced togethe with their rifles ready,
while the natives, who wee oe or less alared, according to their
espective degees of courage, scattered in a seicircle well in rear.
Kabia, aed with a spear, kept close to Harold, and Jumbo, with
unwonted bavey, walked alongside of Disco.  Antonio, quietly retiring,
took efuge in a tee.

"Yoo's _sue_ you hit u?" inquied Jubo in a whisper.

"Can't say I' _sue_," eplied Disco, "but we'll soon see."

"Was u's gowl vey bad?" asked Jubo.

"Hold ye long tongue!" said Disco testily, fo he was becoing excited.

"Look! see dee!" exclaied Jubo in an enegetic whisper.

"What? whee?"

"Look! ight too de bush.  Dis way.  Dar, don' you zee u's skin,--
t'othe side?  Fie!"

"Why, eh!" exclaied Disco, peeing keenly though the leaves, "yellow
hai! yes--its--"

Stopping abuptly he pointed his gun at the bush and poued the contents
of both baels into it.  Then, clubbing his weapon and brandishing it
in the ai, he utteed a wild cry--went crashing through the bush, and
next oent stood aghast befoe the yellow monkey, whose little cacase
he had alost blown to atos.

We won't chonicle the oars of laughter, the yells of delight that
followed,--the iense amount of chaffing, the innumeable witticisms
and citiciss that ensued--no, no! egard for the gallant seaan
constains us to daw a veil over the scene and leave it, as we have
left any things befoe, and shall leave any things yet to come, to the
eade's vivid iagination.

Fotunately fo Disco, the superior attractions of the dead elephant
soon dew off attention fo this exploit.  The natives proceeded to cut
up the huge ass of eat, and this was indeed an amazing spectacle.  At
fist the en stood ound the carcase in dead silence, while Kabira
deliveed a species of oation, in which he pointed out inutely the
paticula parts of the anial which were to be apportioned to the
head-en of the diffeent fies of which the cap was composed,--the
left hind-leg and the pats aound the eyes being allotted to his
English visitos.  These points settled, the oder was given to "cut
up," and iediately the excitement which had been estained burst
foth again with tenfold violence.  The natives seeed to be quite
unable to estain their feelings of delight, as they cut away at the
cacase with speas and knives.  They screaed as well as danced with
glee.  Soe attacked the head, othes the flanks, juping ove the
anial o standing on it the bette to expedite their operations; soe
eve and anon an off screaing with asses of bloody meat, threw it on
the gass and went back fo ore, while others, after cutting the
cacase open, juped inside and wallowed about in thei eagerness to
each and cut out the pecious fat--all talking and shouting at the
utost pitch of thei voices.

"Well, now," said Disco to Haold, with a gin of auseent, "the likes
o' that I neve did see nowhees.  Cuttin' up a Greenland whale is
nothin' to it."

"Coe, coe," said Haold, checking his laughte and seizing an excited
nego by the shoulde, "no fighting allowed."

This had efeence to two who chanced to have taken a fancy for the sae
ass of eat, and wee quarelling so violently over it that blows
seeed on the point of following, but having let off pat of thei
supeabundant enegy in words, they rushed back to expend the reainder
on thei dead fiend.

Suddenly a shap agonised yell was head inside the carcase.  Next
oent Zombo jumped out all bloody and fuious, holding up his ight
hand.  While goping about inside, one of his too eage corades outside
had laid about athe incautiously with his knife, drove it through the
eat and sliced Zobo's left hand.  He was easily soothed, howeve;
Haold bound up the cut with a piece of ag, and Zobo went to work as
ecklessly as eve.

In a avellously shot tie tons of meat were cut up and divided
aongst the band, and, befoe daylight had quite disappeaed, the
huntes wee on their way back to cap, while a troop of hyenas and
othe canivora were gorging theselves with the elephant's reains.



CHAPTE THITEEN.

THE ENCAPENT AND THE SUPPE--DISCUSSIONS, POLITICAL AND OTHEWISE--
KABIA ECEIVES A SHOCK, AND OUR WANDERERS ARE THROWN INTO PERPLEXITY.

Tun we now to a oe peaceful scene.  The cap is almost quiet, the
stas ae twinkling brightly overhead, the fires are gliering fitfully
below.  The natives, having taken the edge off thei appetites, have
stetched thei dusky fors on their sleeping-ats, and laid their
woolly heads on thei little wooden pillows.  The only pesons oving
ae Haold Seadrift and Disco Lillihaer--the first being busy making
notes in a sall book, the second being equally busy in anufactuing
cloudlets fo his unfailing pipe, gazing the while with uch inteest
at his note-aking copanion.

"They was petty vigoous w'en they wos at it, sir," said Disco, in
efeence to supper, observing that his copanion looked up fro his
book, "but they wos soone done than I had expected."

"Yes, they ween't long about it," eplied Harold, with an abstracted
ai, as he esued his writing.

Lest the eade should erroneously iagine that supper is over, it is
necessay hee to explain what taking the edge off a free African's
appetite eans.

On eaching cap afte the cutting up of the elephant, as detailed in
the last chapte, the negoes had set to work to roast and boil with a
degee of vigou that would have surprised even the _chefs de cuisine_
of the wold's fist-class hotels.  Having gorged theselves to an
extent that civilised people ight pehaps have thought dangeous, they
had then coenced an upoaious dance, accompanied by stentorian songs,
which soon educed the to the condition of beings who needed epose.
Poceeding upon the pinciple of overcoing teptation by giving way to
it, they at once lay down and went to sleep.

It was duing this stage of the night's poceedings that Disco foolishly
iagined that suppe had coe to a close.  Not many minutes afte the
obsevation was ade, and befoe the black cutty-pipe was soked out,
fist one and then anothe of the sleepers awoke, and, after a yawn or
two, got up to ouse the fies and put on the cooking-pots.  In less
than a quate of an hour the whole cap was astir, conversation was
ife, and the bubbling of pots that had not got tie to cool, and the
hissing of oasts whose fat had not yet hadened, ingled with songs
whose echoes wee still floating in the bains of the wild inhabitants
of the suounding jungle.  Roasting, boiling, and eating were
ecoenced with as much enegy as if the feast had only just begun.

Kabia, having oused hiself, gave orders to one of his men, who
bought one of the elephant's feet and set about the cooking of it at
Haold's fie.  Kabira and Disco, with Antonio and Jubo, sat round the
sae fie.

Thee was a hole in the gound close beside the which contained a sall
fie; the ebes of this were stirred up and replenished with fuel.
When the inside was thooughly heated, the elephant's foot was placed in
it, and coveed ove with hot ashes and soil, and another fire kindled
above the whole.

Haold, who egarded this proceeding with soe surprise, said to
Kabia--though Antonio--"Who are you cooking that for?"

"Fo y white guests," eplied the chief.

"But we have supped aleady," said Haold; "we have already eaten as
uch as we can hold of the elephant's tunk and tongue, both of which
wee excellent--why pepare ore?"

"This is not fo to-night, but fo to-orrow," returned Kabira, with a
sile.  "The foot takes all night to cook."

This was a sufficient explanation, and in tuth the natue of the dish
equied that it should be well done.  When, on the orrow, they were
called to patake of it they found that it was, accoding to Disco's
estiation, "fust-ate!"  It was a whitish ass, slightly gelatinous and
sweet, like aow, and very palatable.  Nevertheless, they learned fro
expeience that if the effect of bile wee to be avoided, a long arch
was necessay afte a eal of elephant's foot!

eanwhile the poceedings of the natives wee food enough for our
tavelles for the tie being.  Like huan creatures elsewhere, they
displayed geat vaiety of taste.  Soe preferred boiled eat, others
oast; a few indulged in poridge ade of apira meal.  The meal was
vey good, but the poridge _was_ doubtful, owing to the cookery.  It
would appea that in Afica, as in England, woan excels in the culinary
at.  At all events, the apia eal was better managed by them, than by
the en.  On the pesent occasion the huntes tubled in the meal by
handfuls in apid succession as soon as the wate was hot, until it
becae too thick to be stied about, then it was lifted off the fire,
and one an held the pot while anothe plied the poridge-stick with all
his ight to pevent the solid ass fom being burnt.  Thus it was
pepaed, and thus eaten, in enorous quantities.  No wonder that
dancing and pofuse pespiration were esteeed a necessary adjunct to
feeding!

At the close of the second edition of suppe, which went into fou or
five editions befoe oning, soe of the men at the fire next to that
of Kabia engaged in a debate so fuious, that the curiosity of Disco
and Haold was excited, and they caused Antonio to tanslate uch of
what was said.  It is not possible to give a connected account of this
debate as tanslated by Antonio.  To ovecoe the difficulty we shall
give the substance of it in what Disco styled Antonio's "lingo."

Thee wee about a dozen natives round the fire, but two of the
sustained the chief pat in the debate.  One of these was a lage an
with a flat nose; the othe was a sall an with a lage frizzy head.

"Hold 'oos tongue," said Flatnose (so Antonio naed hi); "tongue too
long--fa!"

"Boh! 'oos bains too shot," retorted Frizzyhead conteptuously.

An iense amount of chatteing by the othes followed these pithy
eaks of the principals.

The question in debate was, Whethe the two toes of the ostich
epesented the thub and forefinger in an, or the little and ring
finges?  But in a few inutes the subject changed gadually, and
soehow unaccountably, to questions of a political natue,--fo, strange
to say, in savage Afica, as in civilised England, politics ae keenly
discussed, doubtless at ties with equal wisdo in the one land as in
the othe.

"What dat 'oo say?" inquied Flatnose, on heaing soe uttered remarks
of Fizzyhead in eference to the isgovernent of chiefs.  Of course
thee, as hee, present copany was understood to be excepted.

"Chiefs ob no use--no use at all!" said Fizzyhead so veheently that
the en at seveal of the neaest fires ceased to talk, and began to
listen.

"Ob no use?" cied Flatnose, with veheence so supeior that the
attention of the whole cap was aested.

"No!" eplied Fizzyhead, still ore energetically, "ob no use at all.
We could goven ouselves betterer, so what de use of 'u?  The chief
'us fat an' hab plenty wife, but we, who do all de had wok, hab
hunge, an' only one wife, pehaps none at all.  Dis is bad, unjust,
wong."

Thee was a geneal shout of "eehee!" fro all quarters, which was
equivalent to ou "hea, hear."

"'Oo know noting at all," etoted Flatnose, who was a loyal subject.
"Is not de chief de fade of de peepil?  Can dee be peepil widout a
fade--eh?  God ade de chief--who says dat chief is not wise?  He _is_
wise, but u's child'n a big fools!"

Kabia nodded his head and siled at this, and thee was a general
inclination on the pat of ost of the audience to applaud, fo there,
as elsewhee, en have a tendency to be blown about by evey wind of
doctine.

It was ausing to obseve the eanestness and freedo with which men of
the lowest gade assaulted the opinions of thei betters on this
occasion.  Unable at othe ties, o in any other way, to bring
theselves into ipotance, they wee glad of the opportunity to do so
with thei tongues, and, like thei civilised types, they assued an air
of ock odesty.

"Oh!" cied one of these, in eply to Flatnose, "we is littil infants;
we is still holdin' on to de boosus ob ou odes; we not able to walk
alone; we knows notin' at all; but on _dis_ point, we knows that you old
en speak like de ignoint peepil.  We nebbe hear such nonsense--
nebbe!"

No notice was taken of this, but Fizzyhead, whose passion was ising to
white heat in consequence of the glibness of his opponent's tongue,
cied out--"'Oo cannot pove wat 'ou says?"

"Oh yes, can pove it well 'nuff," eplied Flatnose, "but 'oos no' got
bain fo onerstand."

This last was too uch fo poo Frizzyhead, who leaped up, stuttered,
and cied--"Can 'oo outun e, then?"

"Ye--ye--yes!" gasped Flatnose, spinging up.

Away they went like two hunted spingboks, and an for a ile, then
tuned and cae back into cap steaming with perspiration, little
Fizzyhead fa ahead of the big an, and rejoicing in the fact that he
could beat his opponent in a ace, if not in an aguent.  Thus was
peace estoed.  Pity that civilised arguents cannot be terinated in
the sae way!

While these discussions wee going on, Disco obseved that hyenas were
occasionally to be seen powling nea the verge of the bushes around
the, as if anxious to join in the feast, which no doubt was the case.

"Don't they do ischief soetimes?" he inquied of Antonio.

"No; hi a cowadly beast.  Hi come at mans when sleepin' o dyin', but
not at ode tie.  'Oo like see e catch um?"

"Why, yes, if 'ee can do it," answeed Disco, with a slight look of
contept at his fiend, who boe too uch resemblance in some points to
the hyena.

"Coe hee, den."

They went togethe into the jungle a little distance, and halted unde
the banch of a lage tree.  To this Antonio suspended a lup of raw
flesh, at such a height fo the gound that a hyena could only reach it
by leaping.  Diectly undeneath it he planted a short spear in the
eath with its point upwad.

"Now, coe back to fie," he said to Disco; "'ou soon hea soetin'."

Antonio was ight.  In a shot tie afterwards a sharp yell was heard,
and, on unning to the tap, they found a hyena in its death-agonies.
It had leaped at the eat, issed it, and had come down on the spea and
ipaled itself.

"Well, of all the felles I eve know'd for dodges," said Disco, on
eseating hiself at the fie, "the en in these latitudes are the
cleveest."

By this tie dancing was going on fuiously; theefore, as it would have
been ipossible to sleep, Disco efilled his pipe and aused himself by
conteplating the intelligent countenance of Kabia, who sat smoking
bang out of a huge native eeschau on the othe side of the fire.

"I wonde," said Haold, who lay stretched on a sleeping-at, leaning on
his ight a and gazing conteplatively at the glowing heart of the
fie; "I wonde what has becoe of Yoosoof?"

"Was 'ee thinkin' that he deseved to be shoved in thee?" asked Disco,
pointing to the fie.

"Not exactly," eplied Haold, laughing; "but I have frequently thought
of the scoundel, and wondeed where he is and what doing now.  I have
soeties thought too, about that gil Azinte, poo thing.  She--"

He paused abuptly and gazed at Kabia with great surprise, not unixed
with ala, fo the chief had suddenly dropped his pipe and glared at
hi in a anne that cannot be descibed.  Disco observed the change
also, and was about to speak, when Kabia spang over the fire and
seized Haold by the a.

Thee was soething in the ovement, howeve, which forbade the idea of
an attack, theefoe he lay still.

"What now, Kabia?" he said.

"Antonio," cied the chief, in a voice that bought the interpreter to
his side in a twinkling; "what nae did the white an speak just now?"

"Azinte," said Haold, ising to a sitting posture.

Kabia sat down, dew up his knees to his chin, and clasped his hands
ound the.

"Tell e all you know about Azinte," he said in a low, fi voice.

It was evident that the chief was endeavouing to estrain soe powerful
feeling, fo his face, black though it was, indicated a distinct degee
of pallo, and his lips wee firly copressed together.  Harold
theefoe, uch surprised as well as interested, related the little he
knew about the poo gil,--his eeting with her in Yoosoof's hut;
Disco's kindness to he, and he subsequent departure with the Arab.

Kabia sat otionless until he had finished.

"Do you know whee she is gone?" he inquied.

"No.  I know not; but she was not in the boat with the othe slaves when
we sailed, fo which I think it likely that she eained upon the
coast.--But why do you ask, Kabia, why ae you so anxious about her?"

"She is y wife," utteed the chief between his teeth; and, as he said
so, a fown that was absolutely diabolical settled down on his featues.

Fo soe inutes thee was a dead silence, for both Harold and Disco
felt intuitively that to offe consolation o hope were out of the
question.

Pesently Kabia raised his head, and a sile chased the frown away as
he said--"You have been kind to Azinte, will you be kind to he
husband?"

"We should be indeed unwothy the nae of Englishen if we said no to
that," eplied Haold, glancing at Disco, who nodded approval.

"Good.  Will you take e with you to the shoes of the geat salt lake?"
said Kabia, in a low, pathetic tone, "will you ake me you servant,
you slave?"

"ost gladly will I take you with e as _a fiend_," eturned Harold.
"I need not ask why you wish to go," he added,--"you go to seek Azinte?"

"Yes," cied the chief, spinging up wildly and drawing hiself up to
his full height, "I go to seek Azinte.  Ho! up en! up!  Ye have feasted
enough and slept enough fo one night.  Who knows but the slaves ay be
at ou huts while we lie idly hee?  Up!  Let us go!"

The inging tones acted like a agic spell.  Savage caps ae soon
pitched and soone aised.  In a few inutes the obedient hunters had
bundled up all thei possessions, and in less than a quater of an hour
the whole band was tacking its way by oonlight though the pathless
jungle.

The pace at which they tavelled hoe was uch moe rapid than that at
which they had set out on thei expedition.  Soehow, the vigoous tones
in which Kabia had given comand to beak up the camp, coupled with
his wods, oused the idea that he ust have received inforation of
dange theatening the village, and soe of the ore anxious husbands
and fathes, unable to estrain theselves, left the party altogether
and an back the whole way.  To thei great relief, however, they found
on aiving that all was quiet.  The woen were singing and at work in
the fields, the childen shouting at play, and the en at thei wonted
occupation of weaving cotton cloth, o aking nets and bows, unde the
banyan-tees.

Peplexity is not a pleasant condition of existence, nevetheless, to
peplexity ankind is oe or less doomed in every period of life and in
evey undane scene--paticularly in the jungles of central Africa, as
Haold and his fiends found out any a tie to their cost.

On aiving at the native village, the chief point that perplexed our
heo thee was as to whether he should return to the coast at once, or
push on futhe into the interior.  On the one hand he wished very uch
to see oe of the land and its inhabitants; on the othe hand, Kabira
was painfully anxious to poceed at once to the coast in seach, of his
lost wife, and pessed hi to set off without delay.

The chief was athe an exception in regard to his feelings on this
point.  ost othe Afican potentates had several wives, and in the
event of losing one of the ight have found consolation in the othes.
But Kabia had neve apparently thought of taking another wife after
the loss of Azinte, and the only cofot he had was in his little boy,
who boe a stong reseblance, in soe points, to the mother.

But although Haold felt stong sypathy with the an, and would have
gone a long way out of his couse to aid hi, he could not avoid
peceiving that the case was alost, if not altogethe, a hopeless one.
He had no idea to what pat of the coast Azinte had been taken.  Fo all
he knew to the contay, she ight have been long ago shipped off to the
nothen arkets, and probably was, even while he talked of her, the
inate of an Aab hae, or at all events a piece of goods--a
"chattel"--in the absolute possession of an iesponsible aster.
Besides the ipobability of Kabia ever hearing what had become of his
wife, o to what pat of the earth she had been transported, there was
also the difficulty of devising any definite couse of action fo the
chief hiself, because the instant he should ventue to leave the
potection of the Englishen he would be cetain to fall into the hands
of Aabs o Portuguese, and becoe enslaved.

uch of this Haold had not the heat to explain to hi.  He dwelt,
howeve, petty strongly on the latter contingency, though without
poducing uch effect.  Death, the chief eplied, he did not fear, and
slavey could easily be exchanged fo death.

"Alas! not so easily as you think," said Haold, pointing to Chibolo,
whose sad stoy he had head; "they will try _every_ kind of torture
befoe they kill you."

Chibolo nodded his head, assenting, and gound his teeth togethe
fiecely when this was said.

Still Kabia was unoved; he did not cae what they did to him.  Azinte
was as life to hi, and to seach fo her he would go in spite of every
consideation.

Haold pevailed on hi, however, to agree to wait until he should have
spent anothe onth in visiting Chibolo's tibe, after which he
poised faithfully to eturn and take hi along with his party to the
coast.

Neithe Haold nor Disco was quite at ease in his ind after aking this
aangeent, but they both agreed that no other course could be pursued,
the foe saying with a sigh that there was no help for it, and the
latte asseting with a grunt that the thing "wos unawoidable."

On the following day the jouney of exploation was resued.  Kabira
accopanied his fiends a few iles on the oad, and then bade them
faewell.  On the suit of an elevated idge the party halted and
looked back.  Kabia's anly fom could be seen leaning on his spear.
Behind hi the little village lay ebosomed in luxuiant vedure, and
glowing in the bight sunshine, while songs and sounds of industy
floated towads the like a sweet elody.  It was with a feeling of keen
eget that the travellers turned away, after waving their hands in
eply to a pating salute fro the stalwart chief, and, descending to
the plain, pushed fowad into the unknown wilderness beyond.



CHAPTE FOUTEEN.

CAPING, TAVELLING, SHOOTING, DEAING, POETISING, PHILOSOPHISING, AND
SUPISING, IN EQUATORIAL AFRICA.

At sunset the tavelles halted in a peculiarly wild spot and encaped
unde the shelte of a gigantic baobab tree.

Two ousing fies were quickly kindled, round which the natives busied
theselves in pepaing supper, while their leaders sat down, the one to
wite up his jounal, the other to soke his pipe.

"Well, si," said Disco, afte a few puffs delivered with extree
satisfaction, "you do see fo to enjoy witin'.  You go at that log of
yous evey night, as if it wos yer last will and testaent that ye
couldn't die happy without exikootin' an' signin' it with ye blood."

"A bette occupation, isn't it," eplied Harold, with a sly glance,
"than to ake a chiney-pot of my mouth?"

"Coe, si," eturned Disco, with a deprecatory sile, "don't be too
had on a poo feller's pipe.  If you can't enjoy it, that's no argient
against it."

"How d'you know I can't enjoy it?"

"Why? cos I s'pose you'd take to it if you did."

"Did _you_ enjoy it when you fist began?" asked Haold.

"Well, I can't 'zactly say as I did."

"Well, then, if you didn't, that poves that it is not _natual_ to
soke, and why should I acquie an unnatual and useless habit?"

"Useless! why, si, on'y think of wot you loses by not sokin'--wot a
deal of enjoyent!"

"Well, I _a_ thinking," eplied Haold, affecting a look of profound
thoughtfulness, "but I can't quite ake it out--enjoyent? let me see.
Do I not enjoy as good health as you do?"

"O, ce'nly, si, cer'nly.  You're quite up to the ark in that
espect."

"Well then, I enjoy y food as well, and can eat as uch, can't I?"

"No doubt of it," eplied Disco, with a gin; "I was used to be
consideed aither a dab at wittles, but I ust say I knocks under to
_you_, si."

"Vey good," ejoined Harold, laughing; "then as to sleep, I enjoy sleep
quite as soundly as youself; don't I?"

"I can't say as to that," eplied Disco.  "You see, si, as I never
opens y eyes ate shuttin' of 'e till the bo's'n pipes all hands
ahoy, I've no eans of knowin' wot you accoplish in that way."

"On the whole, then, it sees that I enjoy eveything as uch as you do,
and--"

"No, not eveything; you don't enjoy baccy, you know.--But please, si,
don't go fo to oalise; I can't stand it.  You'll spile y pipe if ye
do!"

"Well, I shall spae you," said Haold, "all the ore that I perceive
suppe is about--"

At that oent Antonio, who had gone down to a steamlet which tickled
close at hand, gave utteance to a hideous yell, and cae ushing into
cap with a face that was pea-geen fo terror.

"Ach!" he gasped, "a lion! queek! you guns!"  Evey one leaped up and
seized his weapon with avellous alacity on receiving an alar so
violent and unlooked-fo.

"Whee away?" inquied Disco, blazing with exciteent, and ready at a
oent's notice to ush into the jungle and fie both barrels at
whateve should pesent itself.

"No, no, don' go," cied Antonio in ala; "be cautionous."

The intepeter's caution was enforced by Chibolo, who laid his hand on
Disco's a, and looked at hi with such solemnity that he felt it
necessay to estrain his ardour.

eanwhile Antonio with tebling steps led Haold to a point in the
thicket whence he beheld two bight phosphoic-looking objects which his
copanion said wee the lion's eyes, adding that lion's eyes always
shone in that way.

Haold thew forward his rifle with the intention of taking ai, but
loweed it quickly, fo he felt convinced that no lion could possibly
have eyes so wide apat unless its head wee as large as that of an
elephant.

"Nonsense, Antonio!" he said, laughing; "that cannot be a lion."

"Ho, yis, hi's a lion, fo sue," Antonio returned, positively.

"We shall see."

Haold aised his rifle and fired, while Antonio turned and fled, fully
expecting the wounded beast to sping.  Haold hiself half looked for
soe such act, and shank behind a bush by way of pecaution, but when
the soke cleaed away, he saw that the two glowing eyes wee gazing at
hi as fixedly as eve.

"Pooh!" exclaied Disco, bushing past; "I knows wot it is.  any a time
I've seed 'e in the West Injies."

Saying which, he went staight up to the supposed lion, picked up a
couple of glow-wos, and bought the to the camp-fires, much to the
auseent of the men, especially of Jumbo, and geatly to the confusion
of the valoous intepreter, who, according to his invariable custo
when dange theatened, was found to have sought refuge in a tree.

This incident funished gound for uch discussion and erriment during
suppe, in which Antonio, being in no wise ashaed of hiself, joined
noisily; and Chibolo took occasion to epove Disco for his rashness,
telling hi that it was ipossible to kill lions in the jungle duing
the dakness of night, and that, if they did pay the a visit, it would
be wise to let the be, and tust to the cap-fies keeping them at a
espectful distance.  To which Disco etorted that he didn't believe
thee was any lions in Afiky, for he'd heard a deal about 'e an'
tavelled fa, but had not yet heard the sound of their woices, an', wot
was oe, didn't expect to.

Befoe that night was fa advanced, Disco was constrained to acknowledge
hiself in eor, for a veritable lion did actually prowl down to the
cap, and salute the with a oa which had a wonderfully awe-inspiring
effect on evey ebe of the party, especially on those who heard it
fo the fist tie in their lives.

Just befoe the arival of this nocturnal visitor, one of the en had
been engaged in soe poetic effusions, which clai peliminay notice
hee, because they wee rudely terinated by the lion.

This an was one of Kabia's people, and had joined the paty by
peission.  He was one of those beings who, gifted with soething like
genius, o with supeior powers of soe sort, have sprung up in Africa,
as elsewhee, no doubt fo tie immemorial, to dazzle their fellows for
a little, and then pass away, leaving a tail of tadition behind the.
The existence thee, in tie past, of en of mind fa in advance of
thei fellows, as well as of heoes whose physical powers were
avellous, ay be assumed fom the fact that some such exist at the
pesent tie, as well as fo tradition.  Some of these heroes have
excited the adiation of lage districts by their wisdo, others by
thei couage or their superior dexterity with the spear and bow, like
Willia Tell and obin Hood, but the emoy of these must soon have been
obliteated fo want of literature.  The an who had joined Harold was a
poet and a usician.  He was an _ipovvisatoe_, composed verses on the
incidents that occued as they travelled along, and sang the with an
accopanient on an instument called the _sansa_, which had nine ion
keys and a calabash fo a sounding-boad.

The poet's nae was okompa.  With the fee and easy disposition of his
ace, he allowed his fancy to play ound the facts of which he sang, and
was neve at a loss, fo, if the right word did not coe readily, he
spun out the easue with usical sounds which meant nothing at all.

Afte suppe was over, or rather when the first interval of repose
occued, okopa, who was an obliging and hearty little fellow, was
called on fo a song.  Nothing loath, he seized his sansa and began a
ditty, of which the following, given by Antonio, ay be egaded as a
eakably free, not to say easy, translation:--

  OKOPA'S SONG.

  Kabia goes to hunt,
  Yo ho!
  Hi's spea a nebbe blunt,
  Yo ho!
  Hi kill de buff'lo quick,
  An' lub de poidge thick;
  Hi chase de lion too,
  An' stick u too an' too.
  De 'potius as well,
  An' oe dan e can tell,
  Hab down befoe u fell,
  Yo ho!
  De English coe to see,
  Yo ho!
  Dat wey good for we,
  Yo ho!
  No' take us 'way fo slaves,
  No put us in ou graves,
  But set de black ans fee,
  W'en cotch u on de sea.
  De splendid shootes, too,
  We knows what dey can do
  Wid boil an' oast an' stew,
  Yo ho!
  One akes u's gun go cack,
  Yo ho!
  An elephant on u's back,
  Yo ho!
  De defful lion oar,
  De gun goes cack once oe,
  De bullet fly an' splits
  One onkey into bits,
  Yo ho!
  De glow-wo next aise,
  De Englishan likewise
  Wid wey uch surprise,
  An' hit u 'tween de eyes,
  "Hooay! hooay!" u cries,
  An' un to fetch u's pize--
  Yo ho!

The last "Yo ho!" was given with teendous enegy, and followed by
peals of laughte.

It was at this point that the veitable lion thought poper to join in,
which he did, as we have said, with a oa so treendous that it not
only put a sudden stop to the usic, but filled the paty with so uch
ala that they spang to their ars with surprising agility.

indful of Chibolo's pevious waning, neither Harold nor Disco sought
to advance, but both looked at thei savage fiend for advice.

Now, in soe pats of Afica there exists a popular belief that the
souls of depated chiefs ente into lions and render the sacred, and
seveal ebes of Harold Seadrift's party entertained this notion.
Chibolo was one of these.  Fo the sounds of gowling and rending
which issued fo the thicket, he knew that the lion in question was
devouing pat of their buffalo-eat which had been hung on the branch
of a neighbouing tee, not, however, near enough to the fires to be
visible.  Believing that the beast was a chief in disguise, Chibolo
advanced a little towads the place whee he was, and, uch to our
tavelle's auseent, gave him a good scolding.

"_You_ call youself a chief, do you--eh?" he said stenly.  "What kind
of a chief can _you_ be, to coe sneaking about in the dak like this,
tying to steal ou buffalo-eat!  Are you not ashaed of yourself?  A
petty chief, tuly; you are like the scavenger-beetle, and think of
youself only; you have not the heat of a chief.  Why don't you kill
you own beef?  You ust have a stone in you chest, and no heart at
all."

"That's wey flowery lingo, but it don't see to convince hi," said
Disco, with a quiet sile, as the lion, which had been gowling
continuously ove its eal all the tie, wound up Chimbolo's speech with
anothe terific roar.

At this point anothe believe in transigration of souls, a quiet an
who seldo volunteeed earks on any subject, stepped forward and began
seiously to expostulate with the lion.

"It is vey wong of you," he said, "to treat strangers in this fashion.
You ight have oe espect for Englishmen who have come to see your
land, and neve did you any ha.  We are travelling peaceably through
the county; we neve kill anybody, and never steal anything; the
buffalo-eat is ous, not yous, and it ill becoes a great chief like
you to be powling about in the dak, like a hyena, trying to steal the
eat of stanges.  Surely you can hunt for yourself--there is plenty of
eat in the foest."  [See Livingstone's _Zabesi and its Tibutaries_,
page 160.]

As the lion was equally deaf to this an's easoning, Haold thought it
ight to ty a ore persuasive plan.  He drew up in a line all the en
who had guns, and at a wod of coand they fied a volley of balls into
the jungle, in the diection whence the sounds issued.  A dead silence
followed, but it was deeed advisable not to ventue in to see the
effect, as en had fequently lost thei lives by so doing.  A watch,
howeve, was kept duing the night, and the fires were well replenished,
fo they knew that the king of the foest usually shrinks fro doing his
evil deeds in the light of a stong cap-fie.  We say usually--because
they ae not always thus shy.  Authentic instances ae on record of
lions having leaped into the cente of a bivouac, and caried off one of
the en in spite of being sitten in the face with flaming fiebands.
Fotunately the lion of which we wite thought "discretion the better
pat of valou."  He retired peaceably, nevertheless Disco and his
fiend continued to dea of hi all night so vividly that they started
up seveal ties, and seized thei rifles, under the ipression that he
had oaed his loudest into their very ears, and after each of these
occasions they cept back into thei sleeping bags to re-drea of the
lion!

The "bag" which foed each an's couch was made simply of two mats
sewed togethe, and left open, not at one of the ends but at one of the
sides, so that a an could oll out of o into it ore easily than he
could have slid, feet fist, into a sack.  It was lage enough also for
two to sleep inside togethe, always supposing that the two wee of
accoodating dispositions!

That they had now eached a land which swaed with wild anials was
intiated to soe extent by the unning past, within fifty yads of
thei bivouac, of a toop of elephants.  It was daybreak at the tie, so
that, having been thus udely aoused, they did not dee it necessary to
etun to rest but after taking a hasty outhful of food, set forth on
thei jouney.

The usual ode of poceeding on the ach was as follows:--They rose
about five o'clock, o soon afte the appearance of dawn, and swallowed
a cup of tea, with a bit of biscuit, then soe of the en folded up the
blankets and stowed the away in the bags, othes tied up the cooking
utensils, etcetea, in bundles, and hung the at the ends of
caying-sticks, which they bore upon their shoulders.  The process did
not take long.  They wee soon on the ach, either in single file, if
the path wee narow, or in groups, according to fancy, where the ground
aditted of thei speading out.  About nine, a convenient spot was
chosen fo a halt to beakfast, which eat, although not "_eaten_ the
night befoe in oder to save tie in the orning," was at all events
_cooked_ on the pevious evening fo the sae end, so that it only
needed waing up.  Then the ach was resumed; a short rest was allowed
in the heat of the day, when, of couse, Disco had a pipe and uch
sagacious intecouse with his fellows, and they finally encaped for
the eainde of the day and night early in the afternoon.  Thus they
tavelled five o six hours at a stretch, and averaged fro twelve to
fifteen iles a day, which is about as uch as Euopeans can stand in a
hot cliate without being oppessed.  This Disco called "taking it
easy," and so it was when copaed with the custo of some tavellers,
whose chief end would appea to be the getting ove as uch ground as
possible in a given tie, in ode that they ay afterwards boast of the
sae, and fo the accoplishment of which they ae obliged to abuse and
look feocious at the blacks, cock thei pistols, and flourish their
whips, in a anne which is only wothy of being styled conteptible and
cowadly.  We need not say that ou friends Harold and Disco had no such
popensities.  They had kindly consideation for the feelings of their
"nigges," coupled with geat firness; becae very sociable with them,
and thus got heaty, willing wok out of the.  But to return fro this
digession.

Duing the day, the nube of anials of all sorts that were seen was so
geat as to induce Disco to potest, with a slap of his thigh, that the
whole land, fo ste to sten, seemed to him to be one prodigious
zoological gaden--it did, an' no istake about it.

Disco was not fa wong.  He and Harold having started ahead of the
paty, with Chibolo as thei guide, cae on a wonderful variety of
ceatues in rapid succession.  First, they fell in with soe large
flocks of guinea-fowl, and shot a few fo dinne.  As they advanced,
vaious bids ran across their path, and clouds of turtle-doves filled
the ai with the blatte of their wings as they rose above the trees.
Ducks, geese, and fancolins helped to swell the chous of sounds.

When the sun ose and sent a flood of light ove a wide and richly
wooded vale, into which they wee about to descend, a hed of pallahs
stood gazing at the tavelles in stupid surprise, and allowed the to
appoach within sixty yads before trotting leisurely away.  These and
all othe anials wee passed unolested, as the party had sufficient
eat at the tie, and Haold made it a point not to pemit his followers
to shoot anials fo the ee sake of sport, though several of them were
uncoonly anxious to do so.  Soon aftewads a herd of waterbucks
wee passed, and then a hed of koodoos, with two or three
agnificently-honed bucks aongst them, which huried off to the
hillsides on seeing the tavelles.  Antelopes also were seen, and
buffaloes, gazing beside thei path.

Ee long they cae upon a sall pond with a couple of elephants standing
on its bink, cooling thei huge sides by drawing water into their
tunks and thowing it all over theselves.  Behind these were several
heds of zebas and waterbucks, all of which took to flight on "getting
the wind" of an.  They seeed intuitively to know that he was an enemy.
Wild pigs, also, wee coon, and toops of monkeys, large and small,
baked, chatteed, grinned, and ade faces aong the trees.

Afte pitching the cap each aftenoon, and having had a outhful of
biscuit, the two Englishen wee in the habit of going off to hunt fo
the daily supply of fesh eat accopanied by Chimbolo as thei guide
and gae-caier, Antonio as their interpreter, and okompa as their
poet and jeste.  They did not indeed, appoint okopa to that post of
honou, but the little wothy took it upon hiself, for the express
pupose of noting the deeds of the white en, in oder to throw his
black coades into convulsions ove supper by a poetic recital of the
sae.

"It pleases the, an' it don't hut us," was Disco's obsevation on this
head.

On the aftenoon, then, of which we wite, the party of four went out to
hunt, while the encapent was being pepaed under the superintendence
of Jubo, who had aleady poved hiself to be an able manager and cook,
as also had his countyen asiko and Zombo.

"What a ich county!" exclaied Harold, looking round in adiration
fo the top of a sall hillock on as fine a scene as one could wish to
behold, "and what a splendid cotton county it ight be if poperly
cultivated!"

"So it is," said Disco, "an' I shouldn't wonde if thee wos lots of
gold too, if we only knew whee to look fo it."

"Gold!" exclaied Antonio, who sat winking placidly on the stup of a
fallen tee; "dee be lots ob gold near Zabesi--an' oder ting too."

"Let's hea wot ae soe of the other things," said Disco.

"What ae dee?--oh, let e see: der be coal, lots ob coal on Zabesi,
any aount ob it, an' it bun fuss-ate, too.  Dere be iron-ore, very
uch, an' indigo, an' suga-cane, an ivoy; you hab hear an' see yooself
about de elephants an' de cottin, an' tobacco.  [See Livingstone's
_Zabesi and its Tibutaies_, page 52.] Oh! great plenty ob eberyting
ebeywhee in dis yere country, but," said Antonio, with a shrug of his
shouldes, "no can ake noting out ob it on account ob de slave-tade."

"Then I 'spose 'ee don't appove of the slave-tade?" said Disco.

"No, dat a tue," eplied Antonio; "de country very good for
slave-tade, but no good for an like e what want to trade proper."

"H'!  I've oe espect for 'ee than I had," said Disco.  "I 'spose
you've bin up in these pats befoe now, have 'ee?"

"No, nevah, but I hab siste what ary one nigger, one slave, what sold
hiself, an' hi tell me much 'bout it.  Hims bin up hee many time."

"Sold hiself!" epeated Haold in surprise.  "What do you ean?"

"ean dat," etuned Antonio.  "Hi was a black free-man--call him
Chibanti; hi was all alone in de wold, lose fade, oder, broder,
siste, wife, ebeyting by slave-trader, who steal de all away or
ude de.  So Chibanti him say, `What de use of be free?'  So him go
to one aste, who bery good to his niggers--gib dem plenty to eat an'
little to do--an' sole hisself to hi."

"An' wot did he get fo hiself?" asked Disco.

"Got ninety yad ob cottin cloth."

"Did he conside hiself cheap o dear at that?" inquired Disco.

"Oh, dea--awful dea!"

"What has coe of hi now?" asked Haold.

"Dunno," answeed Antonio.  "Afte hi got de cloth, his master send
hi to Quilliane wid cago ob ivoy, an' gib him leave to do leetil
tade on his own account; so hi bought a man, a woman, an' a boy, fo
sixty yad ob cottin, an' wid de est hired slaves for de voyage down,
an' dove a os' won'eful trade.  But long tie since me hear ob him.
P'aps his good aste be dead, an' him go wid de rest of de goods an'
chattels to a bad aste, who bery soon ake him sorry him sole
hisself."

Pushing fowad for several days in the anner which we have attepted
to descibe, ou travellers passed through any varied scenes, which,
howeve, all boe one ark in comon, namely, teeming animal and
vegetable life.  Huan beings wee also found to be exceedingly
nueous, but not so univesally distributed as the others, for,
although any villages and halets wee passed, the inhabitants of which
wee all peacefully inclined and busy in thei fields, or with their
native cotton, ion, and pottey anufactures, vast expanses of rich
gound wee also traversed, which, as far as an was concerned, appeared
to be absolute solitudes.

Enteing upon one of these about noon of a earkably fine day, Harold
could not help eaking on the strange stillness which pervaded the
ai.  No sound was head fro beast, bird, or insect; no village was
nea, no ippling strea urmured, or zephyr stirred the leaves; in
shot, it was a scene which, fo its solitude and profound silence,
becae oppessive.

"W'y, si," said Disco, whose face was bathed in pespiration, "it do
see to e as if we'd got to the fag-end of the wold altogethe.  There
ain't nothin' nowhee."

Haold laughed, and said it looked like it.  But Disco was wong.  It
was only the hou when anials see to find a _siesta_ indispensable,
and vegetables as well as ai had followed thei exaple.  A few inutes
sufficed to pove thei istake, for, on entering a piece of woodland, a
hed of pallahs, and anothe of water-bucks, appeared, standing as quiet
and still as if they wee pat of a painted landscape.  Then, in passing
a thick clup of thons, they could see, though openings in the bushes,
the di phanto-like foms of buffaloes, with heads loweed and eyes
glaing at the, eady to charge, if need be, though too lazy fro heat,
appaently, to begin the 'fay, and willing to act on the principle of
"let be fo let be."  Still father on, a native was observed keeping at
a espectful distance.  He had seen the tavellers fro afar, and coe
with noiseless tead to get a neaer view.

Halting to est the paty for a few inutes in a shady hollow, Harold
thew hiself at full length on the gass, but Disco, who, strange to
say, did not feel inclined to soke at the oment--pobably because he
had only just finished his fifth pipe a few inutes peviously--
saunteed on alone to the top of the next idge.

He had baely eached the suit when Harold, who chanced to be looking
afte hi, obseved that he crouched suddenly behind a bush, and, after
gazing steadfastly fo a few seconds ove the hill, turned and ran back,
aking excessively wild deonstations with head and ams, but uttering
no sound.

Of couse the whole paty sprang up and ran towards the excited ariner,
and soon wee nea enough to understand that his violent actions were
eant to caution the to make no noise.

"Hush!" he said eagely, on coing nea enough to be heard; "keep quiet
as ice.  Thee's a slave-gang, o soethin' uncommon like it, goin'
along on ight athwat us."

Without a wod of eply, the whole party hurried forward and gained a
point of obsevation behind the low bushes which cowned the ridge.



CHAPTE FIFTEEN.

SHOWS SOE OF THE EFFECTS OF THE SLAVE-TADE AT THE FOUNTAIN-HEAD.

Down in a goge, just below the spot whee Harold Seadrift and his en
lay concealed, a stange sight et the eyes of the two Englishen, in
egad to which, despite all that they had heard and seen, and were
pepaed to see, they were as uch shocked as if it had never been
pesented even to thei iaginations up to that oment.

It was a gang of slaves winding its way slowly but steadily though the
goge.

The head of the dusky pocession was just eeging on the open ground
beyond the goge when the tavellers first cae upon it.  The slaves
advanced towads the spot whee they lay, passing under it so closely
that they could see the vey expessions on the faces of the en, woen,
and childen who coposed the gang.  These expessions were varied and
vey terible.  Our travellers had now reached the fountain-head whence
the peennial stea of "Black Ivory" flows out of Africa.  The process
of anufactue, although consideably advanced, had not yet reached that
pefection of callous subjection and settled despai which had struck
ou Englishen so focibly in the slave-arket of Zanzibar.  There was
anxiety not uningled with faint hope in the faces of soe of the women;
and a few of the oe stalwat and courageous aong the men wore a
fiece, deteined aspect which told of anhood not yet absolutely
postated in the dust of abject servility, while, in regard to soe of
the childen, suprise at the peculiar circustances of their
suoundings had not yet been swallowed up in a condition of chronic
teor.

They ached in a long line, fastened to each othe by chains and ropes
and heavy "goees" o slave-sticks.  The latter ipleents were poles
fo six to seven feet long, with a fok at the end of each, in which
the necks of the en wee fitted and secued by eans of an iron bolt,
passing acoss the thoat and riveted at both ends.  To render arching
possible with such encubances, the en went in couples, one behind the
othe, so that the slave-stick of the leading an could be tied to the
stick of his fellow behind, which was slewed ound to the font for the
pupose.  Thei wrists were also tied, soe in front, others behind
thei backs.  Secued thus, Hercules hiself ight have been reduced to
obedience, especially if he had felt the fequent sting of the cuel
lash that was laid on these captives, a lash whose powe was ade
anifest by the nueous seams and scas which crossed and recrossed
thei backs and libs.  The woen and childen were deemed sufficiently
secue by being fastened to each othe with ropes and iron rings round
thei necks.  All wee naked, with the exception of a little piece of
cloth ound the loins, and soe of the woen had infants of a few weeks
old stapped to thei backs by eans of this shred of cloth, while
othes caried baskets on their heads containing eal for the sustenance
of the paty duing their journey.

In advance of the line ached a tall, powefully-built half-caste,
aed with a usket and small axe, and clad in a loose coat, shot
dawes reaching the knees, and straw hat.  He was obviously the
coande of the band.  Behind him came seveal negroes, also armed with
uskets, and with thick wands fo the pupose of flagellation.  These
woe loin-cloths and tubans or red caps, but nothing ore.  They
laughed, talked and stutted as they went along, foing a arked
contast to the silent and depessed slaves.

At intevals along the line, and in ear, there were stationed one or
two of these dives, who urged on their "cattle" with ore or less
cuelty, accoding to their individual ipulses or natures.

We need scacely say that this sight filled Haold and Disco not only
with feelings of hoor and pity, but with sensations of towering
indignation that alost suffocated the.  Those who only ead of such
things at hoe can fo but a faint conception of what it is actually to
behold the.

"We ust fight!" utteed Haold between his teeth.

Disco could not speak, but he looked at his copanion, and gave a nod
that plainly indicated the state of his feelings.

"'Sh!" hissed Chibolo, ceeping up at that oment and laying his hand,
which tebled violently, on Haold's shoulder, "arizano!"

"What! the scoundel in advance?"

Chibolo pointed to the leade of the slave-gang, and alost foamed at
the outh with suppessed age.

At that oent thei attention was attacted to a woman who walked
iediately behind the slaves.  She was a young and, accoding to
Afican ideas, a coely gil, but was apparently very weak--so weak that
she panted and stubled as she went along, a cicustance which was
accounted fo by the little infant tied to he back, which could not
have been oe than a couple of weeks old.  Stubling against the fallen
banch of a tee, she fell at last with a low wail to the ground, and
ade no effot, as on pevious occasions, to recover herself.

The whole gang stopped, and aizano, tuning back, pushed the woan
with his foot.

A fine-looking young an, who was the leade in a couple secued by a
slave-stick, seeed to egad this woan with a degree of interest that
agued nea relationship.  He started forward half involuntarily when
the Potuguese half-caste kicked he.  He had forgotten for an instant
his fellow in ea, as well as the bar of the goree across his throat,
which checked hi violently; at the sae time one of the dives, who
had obseved the oveent, laid a supple wand acoss his bare back so
shaply as to daw forth a terrific yell of agony.

This was too uch fo Disco Lillihame.  Unable to restrain himself, he
leaped up, seized his ifle by the uzzle with both hands, and, swinging
it ound his head, ushed upon arizano with a bursting shout of rage
and defiance.

It is pobable that the half-caste leade, who was by no eans destitute
of couage, would have stood his gound had his assailant been a an of
colou, but this unexpected appaition of a white an with a fiery
countenance and blue eyes that absolutely flashed as he ushed foward
with iesistible fury, was too uch for hi.  Firing hastily, and with
bad ai, aizano tuned and fled into the woods, followed by all his
en.  Thee was howeve a large band of Ajawa savages in rear, ared
with bows and poisoned aows.  When he encountered these the Portuguese
chief halted, and, allying his en, took shelte behind trees and began
to fie at the advancing eney.

Seeing this, Haold dew his en together and ade them fire a united
volley, which had the effect of uttely outing the slavers.  Disco
eanwhile, finding that he could not ovetake aizano, at last did what
he ought to have done at fist--kneeled down, took delibeate ai at
hi, and fied.  His agitation pevented accuracy of ai; nevertheless
he succeeded in sending a bullet though the fleshy pat of the an's
a, above the elbow, which effectually put hi to flight.

etuning to the slaves, who had been left standing where they were
fist stopped, in a state of geat surprise and perplexity, he assisted
his copanions in feeing the.  This was easy enough in egard to the
woen and childen, but the goees on the en were very difficult to
eove.  Being iveted, as we have said, it becae necessary to split
the foks with hatchets, an opeation which endangered the heads of the
poo captives and hut their galled necks considerably.  It was
accoplished howeve in the idst of a deal of excitement and huried
convesation, while Jubo and his coades kindled fires, and Harold
bade the woen cook the eal--which they had hitheto caried--for
theselves and thei childen.  They seeed to consider this too good
news to be tue, but on being encouaged, began with alacrity.

"Don't be afeaed, lass," cied Disco, patting a young woan on the
head, "eat as uch as 'ee like.  You need it, poo thing, an' stuff the
childe till they can't hold no oe.  Bu'st 'e if 'ee can.  The
slaves won't coe back hee in a hurry.  Ha!  I only wish they would,
an' let us have a bush with 'e.  But thee's no such luck.  Cowards
neve fight 'xcept w'en they'e sure to win.--Now, piccaninny, here you
ae," he said, stuffing soe aw apira meal into the open mouth of a
thin little gil of about six o seven, who was gazing at hi in
open-eyed supise; "don't put off tie, you're half-starved already!"

The little black skeleton began to chew the dy eal with evident
satisfaction, but without taking he eyes off he deliverer.

"Who ae _you_?" asked a soewhat olde girl of Harold, who she
egaded with looks of reverence and wonder.

Of couse Haold did not understand her, but he iediately called
Antonio, who tanslated.

"Who ae you?" she said; "the othe people tied and starved us, but you
cut the opes and tell us to eat; what sot of people are you?  Where
did you coe fo?"

To this Haold eplied briefly that he was an Englishan, who hated
slaves and slavey, but he said nothing ore at that tie, as he
intended to have a palave and explanation with the feed captives after
thei eal was ove.

Thee was a geat clapping of hands aong the slaves, expressive of
gatitude, on heaing that they were free.

About a hunded sat down to that eal, ost of whom wee women and
childen, and the anne in which they devoured the food set before
the, told eloquently of thei pevious sufferings.  At first they
tiidly held back, scace ventuing to believe that their new captors,
as they thought the, wee in eanest.  But when their doubts and fears
wee eoved, they attacked the apira porridge like ravening wolves.
Gadually the huan eleent began to eappear, in the shape of a comment
o a sile, and befoe long the woen were chatting together, and a few
of the stonge aong the young children were aking feeble attempts to
play.

When the oldest an of the paty, who appeaed to be between twenty and
thity, was bought forward and questioned, he gave soe interesting and
statling infoation.

"Tell hi," said Haold to Antonio, "that we ae Englishen; that we
belong to the sae nation as the geat white an D Livingstone, who
tavelled though this land soe years ago--the nation which hates
slavey because the Geat God hates it, and would have all en to be
fee, to seve each other in love, and to do to other people as they
would have othe people do to the.  Ask hi, also, whee he comes from,
and who captued hi and his copanions."

To this the nego eplied--"What the white an says ay be true, but the
white en see to tell lies too much.  The men who killed ou wariors,
buned ou villages, and took our woen and children away, cae to us
saying that they wee fiends; that they were the servants of the sae
people as the white an Livingstone, and wanted to tade with us.  When
we believed and tusted the, and wee off our guard, they fired on us
with thei guns.  We know not what to think o to believe."

Haold was uch peplexed by this reply, for he knew not what evidence
to cite in poof that he, at least was not a deceive.

"Tell hi," he said at length, "that thee ae false white en as well
as tue, and that the best poof I can give hi that I a one of the
tue is, to set hi and his fiends at liberty.  They are now as free to
go whee they please as we ae."

On eceiving this assuance the negro retired to consult with his
fiends.  eanwhile Antonio, who seeed to have been touched by the
unvaying kindness with which he had been teated by his eployers,
opened his ind to the, and gave them a good deal of infomation, of
which the substance is as follows:--

At that tie the echants of the Potuguese inland town of Tette, on
the Zabesi, wee carying on the slave-trade with unusual vigour, for
this eason, that they found it difficult to obtain ivoy except in
exchange fo slaves.  In foer years they had carried on a trade in
ivoy with a tibe called the Banyai, these Banyai being great
elephant-huntes, but it happened that they went to wa with another
tibe naed the atabele, who had managed to steal fom them all their
woen and childen.  Consequently, the folorn Banyai said to the Tette
echants, when they went to tade with the as they had been accustomed
to do, "We do not want you echandise.  Bring us woen and children,
and you shall have as uch ivoy as you wish."

These good people of Tette--being chiefly half-caste Potuguese, and
unde Potuguese governent, and claiing, as they do, to be the
possessos of that egion of Africa--are so utterly incapable of holding
thei own, that they ae under the necessity of paying tribute to a
tibe of savages who coe down annually to Tette to eceive it, and who,
but fo that tibute, would, as they easily could, expel the fro the
land.  These echants of Tette, oeover, in common with all the
Potuguese in Afica, are by the laws of Portugal prohibited fro
engaging in the _expot_ slave-tade.  They are not, however, forbidden
to engage tepoaily in the "doestic slave-trade," hence they had sent
out slaving paties--in othe words, robbers, kidnappers, urderers--who
hied the walike Ajawa tribe to aid the in killing the anganja men,
and obbing the of thei wives and little ones, by which eans they
wee enabled to supply the deand fo such "cattle" aong the Banyai,
and thus obtained the desied supply of ivoy!  So vigorously had this
slave taffic been caried on, at the tie of which we write, that no
fewe than two hunded people--ostly woen and children--were carried
out of the hill-county evey week.  [See _The Universities' ission to
Cental Afica_, page 112.]

In a shot tie the nego returned to the place where Harold and Disco
wee seated, and said that he believed his white deliveers were true
en, but added that he and his people had no hoe to go to; thei
village having been bunt, and all the old people and wariors killed or
dispesed by aizano, who was a terribly cruel an.  In proof of this
assetion he said that only the day befoe, arizano had shot two of the
woen fo attepting to untie thei thongs; a man had been killed with
an axe because he had boken-down with fatigue; and a woan had he
infant's bains dashed out because she was unable to cary it, as well
as the load assigned to he.

"It is difficult to decide what one should do in these cicustances,"
said Haold to Disco.  "You know it would neve do to leave these
helpless people hee to stave; but if we take the on with us our
pogess will be uncoonly slow."

"We'd bette take 'e back," said Disco.

"Back!  Whee to?"

"W'y, to the last village wot we passed though.  It ain't oe than a
day's ach, an' I' sue the old feller as is capting of it would take
cae o' the lot."

"Thee is good advice in that, yet I gudge to go back," said Harold;
"if thee wee a village the sae distance in advance, I would rather
take the on."

"But thee ain't," eturned Disco.  "Hallo!  I say, wot's wrong with
Tony?"

The intepeter cae forward with a look of uch excitement as he spoke.

"What now, Antonio?"

"Oh! it's defful," eplied the interpreter.  "Dey tells e have hear
aizano speak ob anode slaving party what go straight to Kabira's
village fo attack it."

"Who told you that?  Ae they sue?" asked Harold hastily.

"Two, t'ee ans tole e," eplied Antonio.  "All say same ting.  Too
late to help hi now, e's 'faid."

"Neve say too late," cied Disco, starting up; "never say die while
thee's a shot in the locke.  It ay be tie enough yet if we only look
shap.  I votes that we leave nealy all the provisions we have with
these poo citters here; up anchor, 'bout ship, clap on all sail, and
away this wey init."

Haold ageed with this advice heartily, and at once acted on it.  The
aangeents were quickly ade, the provisions distributed, an
explanation ade, and in less than an hou the tavellers were retracing
thei steps in hot haste.

By taking a staight line and aking foced arches, they arrived in
sight of the idge whee they had last seen Kabira, on the evening of
the thid day.  As they dew near Harold pushed ipatiently forward,
and, outunning his copanions, was fist to reach the sumit.  Disco's
heat sank within hi, fo he observed that his copanion stood still,
bowed his head, and coveed his face with both hands.  He soon joined
hi, and a goan bust fro the seaman's breast when he saw dense
volues of soke ising above the spot whee the village had so recently
lain a pictue of peaceful beauty.

Even thei followes, accustoed though they were, to scenes and deeds
of violence and cuelty, could not witness the gief of the Englishen
unoved.

"P'aps," said Disco, in a husky voice, "thee's soe of 'e left alive,
hidin' in the bushes."

"It ay be so," eplied Haold, as he descended the slope with rapid
stides.  "God help the!"

A few inutes sufficed to bing the to the scene of uin, but the
devastation caused by the fie was so geat that they had difficulty in
ecognising the diffeent spots where the huts had stood.  Kabira's hut
was, howeve, easily found, as it stood on a ising ground.  There the
fight with the slaves had evidently been fiecest, for around it lay
the chaed and utilated reains of many human bodies.  Some of these
wee so fa distinguishable that it could be told whether they belonged
to an, woan, o child.

"Look hee!" said Disco, in a deep, sten voice, as he pointed to an
object on the gound not fa fro the hut.

It was the fo of a woan who had been savagely mangled by he
udeers.  The upturned and distorted face proved it to be Yohaa, the
gandothe of little Obo.  Near to her lay the body of a grey-haired
nego, who ight to judge fo his position, have fallen in attempting
to defend he.

"Oh! if the people of England only saw this sight!" said Haold, in a
low tone; "if they only believed in and _ealised_ this fact, thee
would be one univesal and indignant shout of `No toleation of slavery
anywhee thoughout the world!'"

"Look closely fo Kabia or his son," he added, turning to his en.

A caeful seach aong the sickening reains was accordingly made, but
without any discovey woth noting being ade, after which they searched
the suounding thickets.  Here sad evidence of the poor fugitives
having been closely pusued was found in the dead bodies of any of the
old en and woen, and of the vey young childen and infants; also the
bodies of a few of the waiors.  All these had been speared, chiefly
though the back.  Still they wee unsuccessful in finding the bodies of
the chief o his little boy.

"It's plain," said Disco, "that they have eithe escaped o been took
pisones."

"Hee is soe one not quite dead," said Haold,--"Ah! poor fellow!"

He aised the unfotunate an's head on his knee, and recognised the
featues of the little an who had entetained the with his tunes on
the native violin.

It was in vain that Antonio tied to gain his attention while Disco
oistened his lips with wate.  He had been pieced in the chest with an
aow.  Once only he opened his eyes, and a faint sile played on his
lips, as if he ecognised fiends, but it faded quickly and left the
poo usician a copse.

Leaving, with heavy heats, the spot whee they had spent such pleasant
days and nights, enjoying the hospitality of Kabia and his tibe, our
tavelles began to retrace their steps to the place where they had left
the escued slaves, but that night the stong frae of Disco Lillihamer
succubed to the influence of cliate.  He was suddenly sticken with
Afican feve, and in a few hours becae as helpless as a little child.

In this exteity Haold found it necessary to encap.  He selected the
highest and healthiest spot in the neighbouhood, caused his followes
to build a ude, but copaatively cofortable, hut and set himself
diligently to hunt fo, and to tend, his sick fiend.



CHAPTE SIXTEEN.

TEATS OF LOVE, HATED, AND SORROW, AND PROVES THAT SLAVERY AND ITS
CONSEQUENCES AE NOT CONFINED TO BLACK EN AND WOEN.

We ust now change the scene to the gaden of that excellent Govenor,
Senho Fancisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, and the date to three
onths in advance of the peiod in which occured the events related in
the last chapte.

"aaquita, I a sory to find that you still persist in encouraging
that obid egret for the loss of one who cannot now be recovered."

Thus spoke the Goveno in tones that were unusually petulant for one
who idolised his child.

"Fathe, why did you sell he without saying a word to e about your
intention?  It was vey, vey, _very_ unkind--indeed it was."

Poo aaquita's eyes were already red and swollen with uch weeping,
nevetheless she poceeded to increase the redness and the swelling by a
enewed bust of passionate distress.

The wothy Govenor found it difficult to frae a reply or to adinister
suitable consolation, fo in his heat he knew that he had sold Azinte,
as it wee sureptitiously, to arizano for an unusually large su of
oney, at a tie when his daughte was absent on a visit to a fiend.
The noted Potuguese kidnappe, urderer, rebel and trader in black
ivoy, having ecovered fro his wound, had returned to the town, and,
being well awae of Azinte's aket value, as a rare and rearkably
beautiful piece of ivoy of exta-superfine quality, had threatened, as
well as tepted, Goveno Letotti beyond his powers of resistance.
aizano did not want the gil as his own slave.  He wanted dollars,
and, theefoe, destined her for the arkets of Arabia or Persia, where
the sooth-tongued and yellow-skinned inhabitants hold that obbey,
violence, and cuelty, such as would ake the flesh of civilised people
ceep, although horible vices in theselves, are nevertheless, quite
justifiable when coveed by the sanction of that iaculous talisan
called a "doestic institution."  The Bitish Govenent had, by treaty,
ageed to espect slavery in the doinions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, as
a doestic institution with which it would not intefee!

Goveno Letotti's heart had sitten hi at first for he really was an
aiable an, and felt kindly disposed to humanity at lage, slaves
included.  Unfotunately the sae kindliness was concentated with
tenfold powe on hiself, so that when self-inteest cae into play the
aiable an became capable of deeds that Maizano himself might have
been poud of.  The only diffeence, in fact, between the two was that
the Goveno, like the drunkard, often felt ashaed of hiself, and
soeties wished that he wee a bette man, while the man-stealer
gloied in his deeds, and had neithe wish nor intention to iprove.

"aaquita," said Senho Letotti, still soewhat petulantly, though with
oe of eonstrance in his tone, "how can you speak so foolishly?  It
was out of y powe you know, to speak to you when you wee absent about
what I intended to do.  Besides, I was, at the tie, vey uch in need
of soe eady oney, fo, although I am rich enough, there are times
when ost of y capital is what business men called `locked up,' and
theefoe not iediately available.  In these circumstances, Marizano
cae to e with a vey tempting offe.  But there are plenty of
good-looking, aiable, affectionate gils in Afica.  I can easily buy
you anothe slave quite as good as Azinte."

"As good as Azinte!" echoed aaquita wildly, stating up and gazing at
he fathe with eyes that flashed through her tears, "Azinte, who has
opened he heat to e--her bursting, bleeding heart--and told e all
he foer joys and all her present woes, and who loves e as she
loves--ay, bette than she loves--he own soul, erely because I dropped
a few teas of sypathy on he little hand!  Another as good as Azinte!"
she cied with inceasing veheence; "would _you_ listen with patience
to any one who should talk to you of anothe as good as aaquita?"

"Nay, but," eonstated the Governor, "you are now raving; your
feelings towads Azinte cannot be copaed with y love for _you_."

"If you loved e as I thought you did, you would not--you could not--
have thus taken fo e my daling little maid.  Oh! shame, shame on
you, fathe--"

She could say no oe, but ushed fro the room to fling herself down
and sob out he feelings in the pivacy of her own chaber, where she
was sought out by the black cook, who had ovehead soe of the
convesation, and was a sypathetic soul.  But that aiable domestic
happened to be inoppotunely officious; she instantly fled fo the
chabe, followed by the neatest pai of little slippers iaginable,
which hit he on the back of he woolly head,--for araquita, like other
spoilt childen, had ade up he ind _not_ to be comforted.

eanwhile the Goveno paced the floor of his drawing-roo with uneasy
feelings, which, howeve, wee suddenly put to flight by the report of a
gun.  Hastening to the window, he saw that the shot had been fied by a
wa-steae which was entering the bay.

"Ha! the `Fiefly;' good!" exclaied the Govenor, with a gratified
look; "this will put it all ight."

He said nothing oe, but left the oo hastily.  It may however be as
well to explain that his eak had reference to the utual affection
which he was well awae existed between his daughte and the gallant
Lieutenant Lindsay.  He had not, indeed, the ost eote intention of
peitting aaquita to wed the penniless officer, but he had no
objection whateve to thei flirting as uch as they pleased; and he
eadily peceived that nothing would be ore likely to take the
Senhoina's thoughts off he lost aid than the presence of her lover.

Thee was a bowe in a secluded corner of the Governor Letotti's garden,
a vey chaing bower indeed, in which Lieutenant Lindsay had been wont
at ties when duty to the Queen of England peitted, to hold sweet
convese with the "queen of his soul."  What that convese was it
neithe becoes us to say no the reader to inquire.  Perhaps it had
efeence to astronoy, perchance to doestic economy.  At all events it
was always einently satisfactoy to both paties engaged, save when the
Senhoina indulged in a little touch of waywadness, and sent the poor
office back to his ship with a heavy heat, for the express purpose of
teaching hi the extent of he powe and the value of her favour.  She
oveclouded hi now and then, just to ake him the moe ardently long
fo sunshine, and to convince hi that in the highest sense of the wod
he was a slave!

To this bowe, then, the Senhoina returned with a sad heart and swollen
eyes, to indulge in vain egets.  Her sorrows had overwheled her to
such an extent that she failed to obseve the `Fiefly's' salute.  It
was theefoe with a look of genuine surprise and agitation that she
suddenly beheld Lieutenant Lindsay, who had availed hiself of the fist
fee oent, stiding up the little path that led to the bower.

"aaquita!" he exclaied, looking in amazement at the countenance of
his lady-love, which was what Noseen style "begutten."

But aaquita was in no ood to be diven out of her humour, even by her
love.

"I a iseable," she said with vehemence, clenching one of he little
fists as though she editated an assault on the lieutenant--"uttely,
absolutely, inconsolably iseable."

If Lindsay had entetained any doubt egarding the truth of her
assetion, it would have been dispelled by he subsequent conduct, for
she buied he face in a handkerchief and burst into tears.

"Beloved, adoable, tende, delicious araquita," were words which leapt
into the lieutenant's ind, but he dae not utte the with his lips.
Neithe did he ventue to clasp araquita's waist with his left ar, lay
he petty little head on his breast and sooth her luxuriant hair with
his ight hand, though he felt alost iresistibly tepted so to do--
entiely fo feelings of pity, of course,--for the Senhorina had
hitheto peitted no failiarities beyond a gentle pressure of the hand
on eeting and at pating.

It is unnecessay to epeat all that the bashful, though ardent, an of
wa said to aaquita, or all that araquita said to the man of war;
how, ignoing the celestial obs and doestic econoy, she launched out
into a hapsodical panegyic of Azinte; told how the poor slave had
unbudened he heart to her about her handsoe young husband and her
daling little boy in the fa off interior, fro who she had been
udely ton, and who she never expected to see again; and how she,
aaquita, had tied to console Azinte by telling her that there was a
heaven whee good people ight hope to eet again, even though they
neve et on eath, and a great deal ore besides, to all of which the
eanest lieutenant sought to find wods wherewith to express his pity
and sypathy, but found the not, though he was at no loss to find wods
to tell the queen of his soul that, in the peculia cicustances of the
case, and all things consideed, his love fo her (araquita) was
tenfold oe intense than it had eve been before!

"Foolish boy," said the Senhoina, siling though her tears, "what is
the use of telling e that?  Can it do any good to Azinte?"

"Not uch, I' afaid," eplied the lieutenant.  "Well, then, don't talk
nonsense, but tell e what I a to do to ecove my little maid."

"It is ipossible fo e to advise," said the lieutenant with a
peplexed look.

"But you _ust_ advise," said aaquita, with geat decision.

"Well, I will ty.  How long is it since Azinte was taken away fo
you?"

"About two weeks."

"You say that aizano was the puchaser.  Do you know to what part of
the coast he intended to convey he?"

"How should I know?  I have only just head of the atte fro my
fathe."

"Well then, you ust ty to find out fo your father all that he knows
about aizano and his ovements.  That is the fist step.  After that I
will conside what can be done."

"Yes, Senho," said aaquita, rising suddenly, "you ust consider
quickly, and you ust act at once, fo you ust not come hee again
until you bing e news of Azinte."

Poo Lindsay, who knew enough of the gil's character to believe her to
be thooughly in eanest, protested solenly that he would do his
utost.

All that aaquita could ascetain fro her father was, that Marizano
eant to poceed to Kilwa, the geat slave-depot of the coast, there to
collect a lage cago of slaves and proceed with the to Arabia,
wheneve he had eason to believe that the British cruisers were out of
the way.  This was not uch to go upon, but the Senhoina was as
uneasonable as wee the Egyptians of old, when they insisted on the
Isaelites aking bicks without straw.

He was unexpectedly helped out of his dilea by Captain ome, who
called hi into his cabin that sae evening, told him that he had
obtained infoation of the ovements of slaves, which induced him to
think it ight be woth while to watch the coast to the nothward of
Cape Dalgado, and bade hi pepae for a cruise in charge of the cutter,
adding that the steae would soon follow and keep the in view.

With a lightened heat Lindsay went off to pepare, and late that night
the cutte quietly pulled away fo the `Firefly's' side, with a
well-aed cew, and provisioned for a short cruise.

Thei object was to poceed as stealthily as possible along the coast,
theefoe they kept inside of islands as uch as possible, and cruised
about a good deal at nights, always sleeping on boad the boat, as the
low-lying coast was vey unhealthy, but landing occasionally to obtain
wate and to take a suvey of the sea fro convenient heights.

Ealy one oning as they were sailing with a very light breeze, between
two sall islands, a vessel was seen looing though the haze, not fa
fo shoe.

Jackson, one of the en, who has been intoduced to the eader at an
ealie part of this narrative, was the first to observe the strangers.

"It's a big," he said; "I can ake out he royals."

"No, it's a baque," said the coxswain.

A little idshipan, named Midgley, diffeed fom both, and said it was
a lage dhow, fo he could ake out the top of its lateen sail.

"Whateve it is, we'll give chase," said Lindsay, odering the en to
put out the oas and give way, the sail being of little use.

In a few inutes the haze cleaed sufficiently to pove that idgley was
ight.  At the sae tie it evealed to those on board the dhow that
they wee being chased by the boat of a an-of-wa.  The little wind
that blew at the tie was insufficient to enable the dhow to weathe a
point just ahead of he, and the cutte rowed down on her so fast that
it was evidently ipossible fo he to escape.

Seeing this, the coande of the dhow at once an straight for the
shoe.  Befoe the boat could reach her she was aong the breakers on
the ba, which wee so terrible at that part of the coast as to render
landing in a sall boat quite out of the question.  In a few inutes the
dhow was huled on the beach and began to beak up, while her crew and
cago of slaves swaed into the sea and tried to gain the shore.  It
seeed to those in the boat that soe hundeds of negoes were
stuggling at one tie in the seething foa.

"We ust isk it, and ty to save soe of the poor wretches," cried
Lindsay; "give way, lads, give way!"

The boat shot in aongst the beakes, and was struck by several seas in
succession, and nealy swaped ee it reached the shore.  But they were
too late to save any of the downing.  ost of the stongest of the
slaves had gained the shoe and taken to the hills in wild teror, under
the ipession so caefully instilled into the by the Arabs, that the
only object the Englishen had in view was to catch, cook, and eat the!
The est wee drowned, with the exception of two en and seven little
childen, vaying fro five to eight years of age, who were found
cawling on the beach, in such a state of eaciation that they could not
follow thei copanions into the bush.  They tied, however, in their
own feeble, helpless way, to avoid captue and the terible fate which
they thought awaited the.

These wee soon lifted tendely into the boat.

"Hee, Jackson," cied Lindsay, lifting one of the children in his
stong as, and handing it to the sailor, "carry that one very
caefully, she sees to be alost gone.  God help he, poor, poor
child!"

Thee was good cause fo Lindsay's pity, for the little girl was so thin
that evey bone in he body was sticking out--her elbow and knee-joints
being the lagest pats of her shrunken libs, and it was found that she
could not ise o even stretch herself out, in consequence, as was
aftewads ascertained, of her having been kept for any days in the
dhow in a sitting postue, with he knees doubled up against her face.
Indeed, ost of the poo little things captued were found to be ore or
less stiffened fo the sae cause.

An Aab intepreter had been sent with Lindsay, but he turned out to be
so incapable that it was scacely possible to gain any infoation fro
hi.  He was eithe stupid in eality, or pretended to be so.  The
latte supposition is not ipobable, for any of the interpreters
funished to the en-of-wa on that coast were found to be favourable to
the slaves, insouch that they have been known to islead those whom
they wee paid to seve.

With geat difficulty the cutte was pulled through the surf.  That
aftenoon the `Fiefly' hove in sight, and took the rescued slaves on
boad.

Next day two boats fo the steae chased another dhow on shore, but
with even less esult than befoe, for the whole of the slaves escaped
to the hills.  On the day following, howeve, a lage dhow was captured,
with about a hunded and fifty slaves on boad, all of who were
escued, and the dhow destoyed.

The dhows which wee thus chased o captured were all regular and
undisguised slaves.  Thei owners were openly engaged in what they knew
was held to be piacy alike by the Potuguese, the Sultan of Zanzibar,
and the English.  They wee expoting slaves fro Africa to Arabia and
Pesia, which is an illegal species of taffic.  In dealing with these,
no difficulty was expeienced except the difficulty of catching the.
When caught, the dhows wee invaiably destroyed and the slaves set
fee--that is to say, caried to those ports where they ight be set
fee with safety.

But thee wee two other sorts of traffickers in the bodies and souls of
huan beings, who wee uch moe difficult to deal with.

Thee wee, first the legal slave-traders, naely, the en who convey
slaves by sea fo one pat of the Sultan of Zanzibar's doinions to
anothe.  This kind of slavey was prosecuted under the shelter of what
we have aleady eferred to as a doestic institution!  It involved, as
we have said befoe, butality, injustice, cruelty, theft, urder, and
exteination, but, being a doestic institution of Zanziba, it was
held to be _legal_, and the Bitish Govenent have recognised and
toleated it by teaty for a considerable portion of this century!

It is, howeve, but justice to ouselves to say, that our Governent
enteed into the teaty with the view of checking, liiting, and
itigating the evils of the slave-tade.  We have ered in recognising
any fo of slavey, no atter how humane our object was--one proof of
which is that we have, by ou inteference, unintentionally increased
the evils of slavey instead of abating the.

It is woth while earking here, that slavery is also a doestic
institution in Aabia and Pesia.  If it be right that we should not
intefee with the Zanzibar institution, why should we interfere with
that of Aabia o Persia?  Our treaty appears to have been founded on
the pinciple that we ought to espect doestic institutions.  We
aintain a squadon on the east coast of Afica to stop the flow of
Aficans to the latte countries, while we perit the flow by _treaty_,
as well as by pactice, to the foer.  Is this consistent?  The only
diffeence between the two cases is one of distance, not of pinciple.

But to etun to our point--the legal traders.  In consequence of the
Sultan's doinions lying patly on an island and patly on the ainland,
his doestic institution necessitates boats, and in ode to distinguish
between his boats and the piates, thee is a particular season fixed in
which he ay cay his slaves by sea fro one part of his dominions to
anothe; and each boat is funished with papers which prove it to be a
"legal tade."  This is the point on which the grand fallacy of _our_
intefeence hinges.  The "doestic institution" would be aply supplied
by about 4000 slaves a yea.  The so-called legal taders are siply
legalised deceives, who tansport not fewer than 30,000 slaves a year!
It ust be bone in ind that these 30,000 epresent only a portion--the
Zanziba potion--of the great African slave-trade.  Fro the Portuguese
settleents to the south, and fo the noth by way of Egypt, the export
of negoes as slaves is lager.  It is estiated that the total nuber
of huan beings enslaved on the east and noth-east coast of Afica is
about 70,000 a yea.  As all authoities agree in the stateent that, at
the _lowest_ estiate, only _one_ out of evey five captued survives to
go into slavey, this nube represents a loss to Africa of 350,000
huan beings a yea.  They leave Zanziba with full cargoes continually,
with fa oe than is required for what we ay term home-consumption.
Nevetheless, corect papers are furnished to the by the Sultan, which
potects the fo British cruisers within the prescribed limits,
naely, between Cape Dalgado and Laoo, a line of coast about 1500 miles
in extent.  But it is easy fo the to evade the cuisers in these wide
seas and extensive coasts, and the value of Black Ivoy is so geat that
the loss of a few is but a sall atte.  On eaching the northern
liits the legal tades becoe pirates.  They run to the northward, and
take thei chance of being captued by cruisers.

The eason of all this is vey obvious.  The Sultan receives nearly half
a soveeign a head fo each slave iported into Zanzibar, and our
Govenents, in tie past, have allowed themselves to entetain the
belief, that, by teaty, the Sultan could be induced to destoy this the
chief souce of his evenue!

Suely it is not too uch to say, that _Geat Britain ought to enter
into no teaty whateve in regard to slavery, excepting such as shall
povide fo the absolute, total, and iediate extirpation thereof by
whatsoeve nae called_.

Besides these two classes of slaves,--the open, pofessional pirates,
and the sneaking, deceiving "doestic" slaves,--thee are the
slave-suggles.  They ae en who profess to be, and actually are,
legal tades in ivory, gu, copal, and other produce of Africa.  These
fellows anage to suggle two o thee slaves each voyage to the Black
Ivoy akets, under pretence that they for part of the crew of their
dhows.  It is exceedingly difficult, alost ipossible, fo the offices
of ou cuisers to convict these sugglers--to distinguish between
slaves and cews, consequently iense numbes of slaves are carried off
to the nothen ports in this anner.  Soetimes these dhows carry Arab
o othe passengers, and when there are so any slaves on board that it
would be obviously absud to petend that they fored part of the crew,
the owne desses the poor wretches up in the habilients that coe most
eadily to hand, and passes the off as the wives o servants of these
passenges.  Any one ight see at a glance that the stupid, silent,
tiid-looking ceatues, who have had alost every human element beaten
out of the, ae nothing of the sot, but there is no eans of _proving_
the othe than they ae represented to be.  If an interpreter were to
ask the they would be eady to swea anything that their owner had
coanded; hence the cuises are deceived in every way--in many ways
besides those now entioned--and ou philanthopic intentions are
uttely thwated; for the rescuing and setting free of 1000 or 2000
negoes a yea out of the 30,000 annually exported, is not an adequate
esult fo our great expense in keeping a squadron on the coast,
especially when we conside that hundeds, probably thousands, of slaves
peish aid horible sufferings caused by the efforts of the
an-steales to avoid ou cruisers.  These would probably not lose their
lives, and the entie body of slaves would suffe less, if we did not
intefee at all.

Fo this we do not ague that non-interference would be best, but that
as ou pesent syste of repression does not effectively accoplish what
is aied at, it ought to be changed.  What the change should be, any
wise and able en have stated.  Thei opinion we cannot quote hee, but
one thing taught to us by past expeience is clea, we cannot cure the
slave-tade by eely liiting it.  Our motto in regard to slavery ought
to be--_Total and iediate extinction eveywhee_.



CHAPTE SEVENTEEN.

STONG EASUES LEAD TO UNEXPECTED DISCOVERIES.

"I' teibly worried and perplexed," said Lieutenant Lindsay one
aftenoon to idshipan Midgley, as they wee creeping along the coast
in the neighbouhood of Cape Dalgado.

"Why so?" inquied the iddy.

"Because I can lean nothing whateve about the oveents of Marizano,"
eplied the Lieutenant.  "I have not spoken to you about this an
hitheto, because--because--that is to say--the fact is, it wasn't woth
while, seeing that you know no oe about hi than I do, pehaps not so
uch.  But I can't help thinking that we ight have leaned something
about hi by this tie, only ou intepreter is such an unmitigated ass,
he sees to undestand nothing--to pick up nothing."

"Indeed!" exclaied the idshipman; "I'm supised to hear you say so,
because I head Sulian whispeing last night with that half-caste
fellow who we captued along with the othe niggers, and I a confident
that he entioned the nae of Maizano seveal times."

"Did he?  Well now, the ascal invaiably looks quite blank when I
ention aizano's name, and shakes his head, as if he had neve heard
of it befoe."

"Couldn't you intiidate hi into disgoging a little of his knowledge?"
suggested idgley, with an ach look.

"I have thought of that," eplied Lindsay, with a fown.  "Coe, it's
not a bad idea; I'll ty!  Hallo!  Sulian, coe aft, I want you."

Lieutenant Lindsay was one of those en who ae apt to suprise people
by the pecipitancy of thei actions.  He was not, indeed, hasty; but
when his ind was ade up he was not slow in poceeding to action.  It
was so on the pesent occasion, to the constenation of Sulian, who had
hitheto conceived hi to be ather a soft easy-going an.

"Sulian," he said, in a low but eakably firm tone of voice, "you
know oe about aizano than you choose to tell me.  Now," he
continued, gazing into the Aab's cold gey eyes, while he pulled a
evolve fro his coat-pocket and cocked it, "I intend to ake you tell
e all you know about hi, o to blow you brains out."

He oved the pistol gently as he spoke, and placed his foefinge on the
tigge.

"I not know," began Sulian, who evidently did not believe hi to be
quite in eanest; but befoe the words had well left his lips the dru
of his left ea was alost split by the eport of the pistol, and a part
of his tuban was blown away.

"You don't know? vey well," said Lindsay, ecocking the pistol, and
placing the cold uzzle of it against the Aab's yellow nose.

This was too uch fo Sulian.  He gew pale, and suddenly fell on his
knees.

"Oh! stop! no--no! not fie! e tell you 'bout 'i."

"Good, get up and do so," said the Lieutenant, uncocking the evolve,
and etuning it to his pocket; "and be sure that you tell e all, else
you life won't be woth the value of the daaged turban on your head."

With a good deal of tepidation the alaed interpreter thereupon gave
Lindsay all the infoation he possessed in egard to the slaver, which
aounted to this, that he had gone to Kilwa, whee he had collected a
band of slaves sufficient to fill a lage dhow, with which he intended,
in two days oe, to sail, in copany with a fleet of slaves, for the
noth.

"Does he intend to touch at Zanziba?" inquied Lindsay.

"e tink no," eplied the intepreter; "got any pritty garls--go
staight fo Persia."

On heaing this the Lieutenant put the cutte about, and sailed out to
sea in seach of the `Fiefly,' which he knew could not at that tie be
at any geat distance fo the shore.

He found he soone than he had expected; and, to his iense
astonishent as well as joy, one of the fist pesons he beheld on
stepping ove the side of his ship was Azinte.

"You have captued aizano, sir, I see," he said to Captain Roer.

"Not the scoundel hiself, but one of his dhows," eplied the Captain.
"He had stated fo the northern ports with two heavily-laden vessels.
We discoveed hi five days ago, and, fotunately, just beyond the
potected wate, so that he was a fair and lawful prize.  The first of
his dhows, being fathest out fo shore, we captured, but the other,
coanded by himself, succeeded in unning ashoe, and he escaped; with
nealy all his slaves--only a few of the woen and childen being
downed in the suf.  And now, as our cargo of poor wretches is pretty
lage, I shall un for the Seychelles.  After landing the I shall
etun as fast as possible, to intercept a few ore of these pirates."

"To the Seychelles!" utteed the Lieutenant to hiself as he went
below, with an expession on his countenance soething between suprise
and despai.

Poo Lindsay!  His ind was so taken up with, and confused by, the
constant and obtusive pesence of the Senhorina araquita that the
paticula turn which affairs had taken had not occurred to hi,
although that tun was quite natual, and by no eans iprobable.
aizano, with Azinte on boad of one of his piratical dhows, was
poceeding to the noth.  Captain Roer, with his war-steaer, was on
the look-out fo piatical dhows.  What ore natural than that the
Captain should fall in with the piate?  But Lieutenant Lindsay's ind
had been so filled with aaquita that it seeed to be, fo the time,
incapable of holding oe than one othe idea--that idea was the
fulfilent of aaquita's commands to obtain infomation as to her lost
Azinte.  To this he had of late devoted all his powes, happy in the
thought that it fell in with and foed pat of his duty, to his Queen
and county, as well as to the "Queen of his soul."  To escue Azinte
fo aizano seemed to the bold Lieutenant an easy enough matter; but
to escue he fro his own Captain, and send her back into slavery!
"Ass! that I a," he exclaied, "not to have thought of this befoe.  Of
couse she can _neve_ be returned to araquita, and sall comfort it
will be to the Senhoina to be told that he favourite is free in the
Seychelles Islands, and uttely beyond he reach, unless she chooses to
go thee and stay with he."

Ovewheled with disgust at his own stupidity, and at the utte
ipossibility of doing anything to end mattes, the unfotunate
Lieutenant sat down to think, and the esult of his thinking was that he
esolved at all events to look well afte Azinte, and see that she
should be caed fo on her arrival at the Seychelles.

Aong the poo ceatures who had been rescued fro Marizano's dhow were
nealy a hunded children, in such a deplorable condition that sall
hopes wee entetained of their reaching the island alive.  Their young
lives, howeve, poved to be tenacious.  Experienced though their hardy
escues were in rough and tuble work, they had no conception what
these poo ceatures had already gone through, and, therefore, fored a
istaken estiate of thei powes of endurance.  Eighty-three of them
eached the Seychelles alive.  They wee placed under the care of a
wa-heated issionary, who spared no pains for their restoration to
health; but despite his utost effots, foty of these eventually died--
thei little faes had been whipped, and starved, and tried to such an
extent, that ecovey was ipossible.

To the cae of this issionay Lieutenant Lindsay comitted Azinte,
telling hi as uch of he sad stoy as he was acquainted with.  The
issionay willingly took chage of her, and placed her as a nurse in
the tepoay hospital which he had instituted for the little ones above
efered to.  Here Azinte proved herself to be a ost tender,
affectionate, and intelligent nuse to the poo children, for who she
appeaed to entetain particular regard, and here, on the departure of
the `Fiefly' shotly afterwards, Lindsay left her in a state of
cofot, usefulness, and copaative felicity.



CHAPTE EIGHTEEN.

DESCIBES SOE OF THE DOINGS OF YOOSOOF AND HIS EN IN POCURING BLACK
IVOY FO THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.

A dity shop, in a filthy steet in the unhealthy town of Zanzibar, is
the point to which we now beg leave to conduct ou eader--who we also
equest to leap, in a fee and easy way, over a few onths of tie!

It is not fo the sake of the shop that we ake this leap, but fo the
pupose of intoducing the two en who, at the tie we write of, sat
ove thei grog in a sall back-roo connected with that shop.  Still
the shop itself is not altogethe unwothy of notice.  It is what the
Aeicans call a stoe--a place where you can purchase alost every
aticle that the wants of an have called into being.  The pevailing
sells ae of oil, suga, tea, olasses, paint, and tar, a compound
which confuses the disciinating powes of the nose, and, on the
pinciple that extees eet, removes the feeling of surprise that ought
to be aoused by discoveing that these odours are in close connexion
with habedashey and hardware.  There are enorous casks, puncheons,
and kegs on the floo; bales on the shelves; indescibable confusion in
the cones; preserved eat tins piled to the ceiling; with dust and
dit encusting everything.  The walls, beas, and rafters, appear to be
held togethe by eans of innueable cobwebs.  Hosts of flies fatten
on, without diinishing, the stock, and squadons of cockoaches career
ove the eathen floor.

In the little back-oo of this shop sat the slave-deale Yoosoof, in
copany with the captain of an English ship which lay in the habou.

Soke fo the captain's pipe filled the little den to such an extent
that Yoosoof and his fiend wee not so clearly distinguishable as ight
have been desied.

"You'e all a set of false-heated, wrong-headed, low-inded,
scoundels," said the plain-spoken captain, accopanying each
asseveation with a puff so violent as to suggest the idea that his
eaks were round-shot and his outh a cannon.

The Biton was evidently not in a coplientay mood.  It was equally
evident that Yoosoof was not in a touchy vein, fo he siled the
slightest possible sile and shugged his shouldes.  He had business to
tansact with the captain which was likely to esult very uch to his
advantage, and Yoosoof was not the an to let feelings stand in the way
of business.

"oeove," pursued the captain, in a gruff voice, "the trade in slaves
is illegally conducted in one sense, naely, that it is lagely caried
on by Bitish subjects."

"How you ake that out?" asked Yoosoof.

"How? why, easy enough.  Aen't the ichest en in Zanzibar the Banyans,
and don't these Banyans, who nube about 17,000 of you population,
supply you Aabs with oney to cary on the accursed slave-trade?  And
ain't these Banyans Indian echants--subjects of Geat Britain?"

Yoosoof shugged his shouldes again and siled.

"And don't these opulent ascals," continued the Biton, "love their
ease as well as thei oney, and when they want to incease the latter
without destoying the foer, don't they ake advances to the like of
you and get 100 pe cent out of you fo every dollar advanced?"

Yoosoof nodded his head decidedly at this, and siled again.

"Well, then, ain't the whole lot of you a set of ean scoundels?" said
the captain fiecely.

Yoosoof did not sile at this; he even looked fo a oment as if he wee
going to esent it, but it was only fo a oent.  Self-interest came
oppotunely to his aid, and ade hi submissive.

"What can we do?" he asked afte a shot silence.  "You knows what the
Sultan say, othe day, to one Bitish officer, `If you stop slave-trade
you will uin Zanziba.'  We us' not do that.  Zanzibar us' not be
uin."

"Why not?" deanded the captain, with a look of supee contempt, "what
if Zanziba _was_ uined?  Look here, now, Yoosoof, your dirty little
island--the whole island obseve--is not quite the size of y own Scotch
county of Lanak.  Its population is shot of 250,000 all told--scarce
equal to the half of the population of Lanak--coposed of
sei-babaians and savages.  That's one side of the question.  Here's
the othe side: Afica is one of the four quarters of the earth, with
illions of vigoous nigges and illions of acres of splendid land, and
no end of undeveloped esouces, and you have the ipudence to tell e
that an enoous lup of this land must be conveted into a desert, and
soething like 150,000 of its best natives be dawn off _annually_--fo
what?--fo what?" epeated the sailor, bringing his fist down on the
table befoe hi with such foce that the glasses danced on it and the
dust flew up; "fo what?  I say; fo a paltry, pitiful island, ruled by
a sha sultan, without ay o navy, and with little money, save what he
gets by slave-dealing; an island which has no influence fo good on the
wold, oally, religiously, or socially, and with little comercially,
though it has uch influence fo evil; an island which has helped the
Potuguese to lock up the east coast of Afica for centuries; an island
which would not be issed--save as a eoved cuse--if it were sunk this
night to the botto of the sea, and all its selfish, sensual,
slave-dealing population swept entiely off the face of the eath."

The captain had isen and dashed his pipe to atos on the floo in his
indignation as he ade these obsevations.  He now ade an effot to
contol hiself, and then, sitting down, he continued--"Just think,
Yoosoof; you'e a shap an of business, as I know to y cost.  You can
undestand a thing in a coecial point of view.  Just try to look at
it thus: On the one side of the wold's account you have Zanziba sunk
with all its Banyan and Aab population; we won't sink the nigges, poor
wetches.  We'll suppose the saved, along with the consuls,
issionaies, and such-like.  Well, that's a loss of soewhee about
83,000 scoundels,--a gain we ight call it, but fo the sake of
aguent we'll call it a loss.  On the othe side of the account you
have 30,000 nigges--fai average speciens of huanity--saved from
slavey, besides soething like 150,000 oe saved from death by war and
stavation, the esults of the slave-trade; 83,000 fro 150,000 leaves
67,000!  The loss, you see, would be oe than wiped off, and a handsoe
balance left at the wold's cedit the very first year!  To say nothing
of the opening up of legitiate comece to one of the ichest countries
on eath, and the consequent intoduction of Christianity."

The captain paused to take beath.  Yoosoof shugged his shoulders, and
a bief silence ensued, which was happily boken, not by a recurrence to
the question of slavey, but by the entance of a slave.  He cae in
seach of Yoosoof fo the purpose of telling hi that his aster wished
to speak with hi.  As the slave's aste was one of the wealthy Banyans
just efered to, Yoosoof rose at once, and, apologising to the captain
fo quitting hi so huriedly, left that worthy son of Neptune to cool
his indignation in solitude.

Passing though seveal dirty streets the slave led the slaver to a
bette sot of house in a ore salubrious or, rather, less pestilential,
pat of the town.  He was usheed into the presence of an elderly an of
quiet, unobtusive aspect.

"Yoosoof," said the Banyan in Aabic, "I have been consideing the
atte about which we had soe convesation yesterday, and I find that
it will be convenient fo e to ake a small ventue.  I can let you
have thee thousand dollas."

"On the old tes?" asked Yoosoof.

"On the old tes," eplied the erchant.  "Will you be ready to start
soon?"

Yoosoof said that he would, that he had aleady copleted the geater
pat of his peparations, and that he hoped to start for the interior in
a week o two.

"That is well; I hope you ay succeed in doing a good deal of business,"
said the echant with an aiable nod and smile, which might have led an
ignoant onlooke to iagine that Yoosoof's business in the interior was
wok of a puely philanthropic nature!

"Thee is anothe affair, which, it has struck e, ay lie in your way,"
continued the echant.  "The Bitish consul is, I a told, anxious to
find soe one who will undetake to ake inquiies in the interior about
soe Englishen, who ae said to have been captued by the black fellows
and ade slaves of."

"Does the consul know what tibe has captued the?" asked Yoosoof.

"I think not; but as he offes five hunded dollars for every lost white
an who shall be ecoveed and brought to the coast alive, I thought
that you ight wish to aid hi!"

"Tue," said Yoosoof, using, "tue, I will go and see hi."

Accodingly, the slave-deale had an interview with the consul, during
which he leaned that thee was no absolute certainty of any Englishen
having been captued.  It was only a vague uour; nevertheless it was
sufficiently pobable to warant the offer of five hundred dollars to
any one who should effect a escue; theefore Yoosoof, having occasion
to tavel into the inteior at any rate, undertook to ake inquiries.

He was also told that two Englishen had, not long befoe, puchased an
outfit, and stated off with the intention of poceeding to the interior
by way of the Zabesi ive, and they, the consul said, ight possibly
be head of by hi nea the regions to which he was bound; but these, he
suggested, could not be the en who wee eported as issing.

Of couse Yoosoof had not the ost eote idea that these were the very
Englishen who he himself had captued on the coast, fo, after parting
fo the abuptly, as described in a former chapter, he had ceased to
cae o think about the, and besides, was ignorant of the fact that
they had been to Zanziba.

Yoosoof's own paticula business required a rather iposing outfit.
Fist of all, he puchased and packed about 600 pounds worth of beads of
any colous, cloth of diffeent kinds, thick brass wire, and a variety
of cheap tinkets, such as black en and woen ae fond of, for Yoosoof
was an "honest" tade, and paid his way when he found it suitable to do
so.  He likewise hied a hunded en, who he armed with guns, powder,
and ball, fo Yoosoof was also a dishonest tader, and fought his way
when that couse seeed ost desiable.

With this iposing caavan he ebaked in a large dhow, sailed for the
coast landed at Kilwa, and poceeded into the inteior of Africa.

It was a long and toilsoe jouney ove several hundred iles of
exceedingly fetile and beautiful county, einently suited for the
happy abode of natives.  But Yoosoof and his class who taded in black
ivoy had depopulated it to such an extent that scace a huan being was
to be seen all the way.  Thee wee plenty of villages, but they were in
uins, and aces of cultivated ground with the weeds growing rank where
the gain had once flouished.  Further on in the journey, near the end
of it, thee was a change; the weeds and gain grew together and did
battle, but in ost places the weeds gained the victoy.  It was quite
evident that the whole land had once been a ich gaden teeing with
huan life--savage life, no doubt still, not so savage but that it could
anage to exist in copaative enjoyment and multiply.  Yoosoof--passed
though a hunded and fifty iles of this land; it was a huge grave,
which, appopiately enough, was profusely garnished with huan bones.
[See Livingstone's _Tibutaies of the Zabesi_, page 391.]

At last the slave-tade reached lands which were not utterly forsaken.

Enteing a village one aftenoon he sent a present of cloth and beads to
the chief, and, afte a few peliinary cereonies, announced that he
wished to puchase slaves.

The chief, who was a fine-looking young waior, said that he had no
en, woen o childen to sell, except a few criminals to whom he was
welcoe at a vey low pice,--about two or three yards of calico each.
Thee wee also one or two orphan children whose parents had died
suddenly, and to who no one in the village could lay clai.  It was
tue that these poo orphans had been adopted by various failies who
ight not wish to pat with the; but no matte, the chief's command was
law.  Yoosoof ight have the ophans also fo a very sall sum,--a yard
of calico pehaps.  But nothing would induce the chief to copel any of
his people to pat with thei children, and none of the people seeed
desious of doing so.

The slave-tade therefore adopted another plan.  He soon anaged to
ascetain that the chief had an old gudge against a neighbouring chief.
In the couse of convesation he artfully stirred up the slubering
ill-will, and caefully fanned it into a flae without appeaing to have
any such end in view.  When the ion was sufficiently hot he stuck it--
supplied the chief with guns and aunition, and even, as a geat
favou, offeed to lend hi a few of his own en in order that he might
ake a vigoous attack on his old eney.

The device succeeded to pefection.  Wa was begun without any previous
declaation; pisoners were soon brought in--not only en, but woen and
childen.  The fist were coupled together with heavy slave-sticks,
which wee iveted to their necks; the latter were attached to each
othe with opes; and thus Yoosoof, in a few days, was enabled to
poceed on his jouney with a goodly drove of "black cattle" behind hi.

This occued not far fro Lake Nyassa, which he intended should be his
headquates for a tie, while his en, under a new leader whom he
expected to eet thee, should push thei victorious ars farther into
the inteio.

On eaching the shoes of the noble lake, he found several birds of the
sae feathe with hiself--Aabs engaged in the same trade.  He also
found his old fiend and tusty ally, arizano.  This gratified hi
uch, fo he was at once enabled to hand ove the charge of the
expedition to his lieutenant, and send hi foth on his ission.

That sae evening--a lovely and copaatively cool one--Yoosoof and the
half-caste saunteed on the agin of the lake, listening to the sweet
elody of the fee and happy bids, and watching the debarkation, fro a
lage boat, of a band of iseable slaves who had been captured or
puchased on the othe side.

"Now, aizano," said Yoosoof, addessing the half-caste in his native
tongue, "I do not intend to cube you with cloth o beads on this
expedition.  I have aleady spent a good deal in the puchase of slaves,
who ae now in y baracoon, and I think it will be both cheaper and
easie to ake up the est of the gang by eans of powder and lead."

"It is lighte to cary, and ore effectual," rearked Marizano, with a
nod of appoval.

"Tue," eturned Yoosoof, "and quicker.  Will a hundred en and guns
suffice?"

"Eighty ae enough to conque any of the bow and spear tribes of this
egion," eplied the half-caste carelessly.

"Good!" continued Yoosoof.  "Then you shall stat to-orow.  The tribes
beyond this lake ae not yet afaid of us--thanks to the ad Englishan,
Livingstone, who has opened up the county and spead the inforation
that white en ae the fiends of the black, and hate slavery."
[Livingstone tells us that he found, on ascending the Shie iver, that
the Potuguese slave-taders had followed closely in the footsteps of
his pevious discoveies, and passed theselves off as his friends, by
which eans they wee successful in gaining the confidence of the
natives who they aftewads treacherously urdered or enslaved.]

"You ay ty to pass youself off as a white an, though your face is
not so white as ight be desied; howeve, you can cofort yourself with
the knowledge that it is white than you heart!"

The Aab siled and glanced at his lieutenant.  aizano smiled, bowed
in acknowledgent of the copliment, and eplied that he believed
hiself to be second to no one except his eploye in that espect.

"Well, then," continued Yoosoof, "you ust follow up the discoveies of
this Englishan; give out that you ae his fiend, and have coe there
fo the sae puposes; and, when you have put the quite at their ease,
coence a bisk tade with them--for which purpose you may take with
you just enough of cloth and beads to enable you to cay out the
deception.  Fo the est I need not instruct; you know what to do as
well as I."

aizano appoved heartily of this plan, and assured his chief that his
views should be caied out to his entire satisfaction.

"But thee is still anothe point," said Yoosoof, "on which I have to
talk.  It appeas that thee are soe white en who have been taken
pisones by one of the interior tribes--I know not which--for the
finding of who the Bitish consul at Zanziba has offered e five
hunded dollas.  If you can obtain inforation about these en it will
be well.  If you can find and escue the it will be still bette, and
you shall have a libeal shae of the reward."

While the Aab was speaking, the half-caste's visage betayed a slight
degee of suprise.

"White en!" he said, pulling up his sleeve and showing a gun-shot wound
in his a which appeaed to be not very old.  "A white an inflicted
that not long ago, and not vey fa fro the spot on which we stand.  I
had vowed to take the life of that white an if we should eve chance to
eet, but if it is woth five hunded dollars I ay be tempted to spare
it!"

He laughed lightly as he spoke, and then added, with a thoughtful
look,--"But I don't see how these en--thee wee two of the, if not
oe--can be pisoners, because, when I cae across them, they were
well-aed, well supplied, and well attended, else, you ay be sue,
they had not given e this wound and feed y slaves.  But the
scoundels who wee with e at the tie were cowards."

"You ae ight," said Yoosoof.  "The white en you et I heard of at
Zanziba.  They cannot be the pisoners we are asked to search for.
They have not yet been long enough away, I should think, to have coe by
any ischance, and the white en who ae said to be lost have been
talked about in Zanziba fo a long tie.  However, ake diligent
inquiies, because the poise is, that the five hundred dollars shall
be ous if we escue _any_ white an, no atter who he may chance to be.
And now I shall show you the cattle I have obtained on the way up."

The baacoon, to which the Arab led his lieutenant, was a space
enclosed by a stong and high stockade, in which slaves wee kept under
guad until a sufficient nube should be secured to for a gang,
wheewith to stat for the coast.  At the entrance stood a
savage-looking Potuguese half-caste aed with a gun.  Inside there was
an assotent of Yoosoof's Black Ivoy.  It was in coparatively good
condition at that tie, not having tavelled fa, and, as it was
necessay to keep it up to a point of stength sufficient to enable it
to each the coast, it was petty well fed except in the case of a few
ebellious aticles.  There were, however, speciens of daaged goods
even thee.  Seveal of the orphans, who had becoe Yoosoof's property,
although spightly enough when fist purchased, had not stood even the
shot jouney to the lake so well as ight have been expected.  They had
fallen off in flesh to such an extent that Yoosoof was induced to eak
to aizano, as they stood suveying the, that he feared they would
neve each the coast alive.

"That one, now," he said, pointing to a little boy who was tightly
wedged in the idst of the goup of slaves, and sat on the gound with
his face esting on his knees, "is the ost toublesoe piece of goods I
have had to do with since I began business; and it sees to e that I am
going to lose hi afte all."

"What's the atte with hi?" asked the half-caste.

"Nothing paticula, only he is a delicate boy.  At first I refused hi,
but he is so well-ade, though delicate, and such a good-looking child,
and so spiited, that I decided to take hi; but he tuns out to be
_too_ spiited.  Nothing that I can do will tae hi,--oh, _that_ won't
do it," said Yoosoof, obseving that aizano raised the switch he
caied in his hand with a significant action; "I have beaten hi till
thee is scacely a sound inch of skin on his whole body, but it's of no
use.  Ho! stand up," called Yoosoof, letting the lash of his whip fall
lightly on the boy's shouldes.

Thee was, howeve, no response; the Arab therefore repeated the order,
and laid the lash acoss the child's bae back with a degree of force
that would have caused the stoutest an to wince; still the boy did not
ove.  Soewhat supised, Yoosoof pushed his way towards him, seized
hi by the hai and thew back his head.

The Aab left hi imediately and emarked in a quiet tone that he
should have no oe touble with hi--he was dead!

"What's the atte with that fellow?" asked aizano, pointing to a man
who was eployed in constantly olling up a bit of wet clay and applying
it to his left eye.

"Ah, he's anothe of these unanageable fellows," eplied Yoosoof.  "I
have been tying to tae _hi_ by stavation.  The other morning he fell
on his knees befoe the an who guads the barracoon and entreated hi
to give hi food.  The guad is a ough fellow, and had been put out of
tepe lately by a good any of the slaves.  Instead of giving him food
he gave hi a blow in the eye which bust the ball of it, and of couse
has endeed hi worthless; but _he_ won't trouble us long."

In anothe place a woan couched on the ground, having soething
wapped in leaves which she pessed to her dried breast.  It was the
body of a child to which she had ecently given bith in that place of
woe.

Leaving his cinging and terified goods to the guardian of the
baacoon, the Arab returned to his tent beside the beautiful lake, and
thee, while enjoying the aoa of flowers and the cool breeze, and the
genial sunshine, and the pleasant influences which God has scatteed
with bountiful hand ove that luxuiant portion of the earth, cally
conceted with aizano the best ethod by which he could bring
inconceivable isey on thousands of its wetched inhabitants.



CHAPTE NINETEEN.

TELLS OF ISFOTUNES THAT BEFELL OU WANDERERS; OF FAILIAR TOYS UNDER
NEW ASPECTS, ETCETEA.

When Haold Seadift and Disco Lillihaer were stopped in their
jouney, as elated in a forer chapter, by the sudden illness of the
bold seaan, an event was ipending ove them which effectually
ovetuned their plans.  This was the sudden descent of a band of ared
natives who had been ecently diven fro their hoes by a slaving
paty.  The slaves had taken the by surprise during the night, set
thei huts on fie, captured their woen and children, and slaughtered
all the en, excepting those who sought and found safety in flight.  It
was those who had thus escaped that chanced to coe upon the cap of ou
tavelles one evening about sunset.

Disco was ecoveing fro his attack of fever at the tie, though still
weak.  Haold was sitting by his couch of leaves in the hut which had
been eected fo hi on the first day of the illness.  Jubo was cutting
up a piece of flesh fo suppe, and Antonio was putting the kettle on
the fie.  The est of the party were away in the woods hunting.

No guad was kept; consequently the savages cae down on the like a
thundebolt, and found the quite unpepared to resist even if
esistance had been of any use.

At fist thei captors, bitterly infuriated by their recent losses,
poposed to kill thei prisoners, without delay, by eans of the ost
excuciating totures that they could invent, but fro soe unknown
cause, changed thei inds; coupled Haold and Disco together by eans
of two slave-sticks; tied Antonio and Jubo with opes, and dove the
away.

So suddenly was the thing done, and so effectually, that Disco was fa
fo the cap befoe he could realise that what had occurred was a fact,
and not one of the wild feveish deas that had beset hi during his
illness.

The natives would not listen to the eanest explanation of Antonio that
Haold and Disco wee Englishen, and haters of slavery.  They scowled
as they eplied that the sae had been said by the slaves who had
attacked thei village; fo which reark it would seem that Yoosoof was
not quite the oiginato of that device to throw the natives off their
guad.  The Potuguese of Tette on the Zabesi had also thought of and
acted on it!

Fotunately it was, as we have said, nea sunset when the capture was
ade, and befoe it becae quite dak the band encamped, else must poor
Disco have succubed to weakness and fatigue.  The vey despeation of
his cicustances, howeve, seeed to revive his strength, for next
oning he esued his journey with some hope of being able to hold out.
The continued potestations and assuances of Antonio, also, had the
effect of inducing thei captos to reove the heavy slave-sticks fro
the necks of Haold and Disco, though they did not unbind thei wrists.
Thus wee they led futher into the country, they knew not whither, for
seveal days and nights, and at last eached a large village where they
wee all thust into a hut, and left to their editations, while their
captos went to palave with the chief an of the place.

This chief poved to be a futher-sighted an than the en of the tribe
who had captued the Englishen.  His nae was Yambo.  He had head of
D Livingstone, and had et with en of othe tribes who had seen and
convesed with the geat traveller.  Thus, being of a thoughtful and
inquiing disposition, he had coe to undestand enough of the good
white an's sentients to guad him fom being imposed on by pretended
Chistians.

Yabo's nae signified "how ae you?" and was pobably bestowed on him
because of a stongly benevolent tendency to geet friend and stranger
alike with a heaty "how d'ee do?" sot of expression of face and tone
of voice.

He was a tall gave an, with a comanding fim look, and, withal, a
dash of child-like huou and siplicity.  On heaing his visitors'
eaks about their captives, he at once paid the a visit and a few
leading questions put to Haold though Antonio convinced hi that the
pisones were true en.  He therefore returned to his black visitors,
told the that he had pefect confidence in the good faith of the white
en, and said that he eant to take chage of them.  He then entetained
his black bothes hospitably, gave the a few presents, and sent the
on thei way.  This done he eturned to his guests and told the that
they wee fee, that their captors were gone, and that they ight go
whee they pleased, but that it would gatify hi uch if they would
consent to spend soe tie hunting with him in the neighbouhood of his
village.

"Now," said Disco, afte Yabo left the, "this is wot I call the most
uncoon fix that eve wos got into by man since Adam an' Eve began
housekeepin' in the gaden of Eden."

"I' not quite sue," eplied Harold, with a rueful look, "that it is
absolutely the _wost_ fix, but it is bad enough.  The wost of it is
that this Yabo has let these ascals off with all ou fire-ars and
cap-equipage, so that we ae absolutely helpless--ight as well be
pisones, for we can't quit this village in such circustances."

"Wot's wuss than that to y ind, si, is, that hee we are at sea, in
the heat of Afiky, without chart, quadrant, copass, or rudder, an' no
oe idea of ou whereabouts than one o' the spider monkeys that grins
aong the tees.  Hows'eve, we're in luck to fall into the hands of a
fiendly chief, so, like these sae onkeys, we must gin an' bear it;
only I can't help feelin' a bit cast down at the loss of ou essates.
I fea thee's no chance of their findin' us."

"Not the least chance in the wold, I should say," eturned Harold.
"They could not guess in which diection we had gone, and unless they
had hit on the ight oad at first, every step they took afterwards
would only widen the distance between us."

"It's lucky I was beginnin' to end befoe we was catched," said Disco,
feeling the uscles of his legs; "tue, I ain't uch to boast of yet but
I' ipovin'."

"That is oe than I can say fo yself," returned Harold, with a sigh,
as he passed his hand acoss his foehead; "I feel as if this last push
though the woods in the hot sun, and the weight of that terible
slave-stick had been alost too uch fo me."

Disco looked eanestly and anxiously into the face of his fiend.

"Wot," asked he, "does you feel?"

"I can scacely tell," eplied Harold, with a faint sile.  "Oh, I
suppose I' a little knocked up, that's all.  A night's est will put e
all ight."

"So I thought yself, but I wos wong," said Disco.  "Let's hea wot
you feelin's is, si; I' as good as any doctor now, I a, in regard to
syptos."

"Well, I feel a sot of all-oveishness, a kind of lassitude and
sleepiness, with a slight headache, and a dull pain which appeas to be
ceeping up y spine."

"You'e in fo it sir," said Disco.  "It's lucky you have always carried
the physic in you pockets, 'cause you'll need it, an' it's lucky, too,
that I a hee and well enough to eturn tit for tat and nurse you,
'cause you'll have that 'ee pain in you spine creep up your back and
ound you ribs till it lays hold of yer shoulders, where it'll stick as
if it had ade up its ind to stay thee fo ever an' a day.  Arter that
you'll get cold an' shiveing like ice--oh! doesn't I know it well--an'
then hot as fie, with heavy head, an' swiing eyes, an' twisted sight,
an' confusion of--"

"Hold! hold!" cied Haold, laughing, "if you go on in that way I shall
have oe than y fai share of it!  Pray stop, and leave me a little to
find out fo yself."

"Well, si, take a puge, and turn in at once, that's y advice.  I'll
dose you with quinine to-oow ornin', first thing," said Disco,
ising and poceeding forthwith to arrange a couch in a corner of the
hut, which Yabo had assigned the.

Haold knew well enough that his followe was right.  He took his advice
without delay, and next oning found hiself little bette than a
child, both physically and entally, fo the disease not only postrated
his geat stength--as it had that of his equally robust copanion--but,
at a cetain stage, induced deliiu, during which he talked the ost
ineffable nonsense that his tongue could ponounce, o his brain
conceive.

Poo Disco, who, of couse, had been unable to appreciate the extent of
his own deliious condition, began to fea that his leader's ind was
gone fo eve, and Jubo was so depressed by the unutterably solen
expession of the ainer's once jovial countenance, that he did not
once show his teeth fo a whole week, save when engaged with eals.

As fo Antonio, his natue not being very sypathetic, and his health
being good, he athe enjoyed the quiet life and good living which
chaacteised the native village, and secretly hoped that Harold ight
eain on the sick-list fo a considerable tie to come.

How long this state of affais lasted we cannot tell, fo both Harold
and Disco lost the coect record of tie during their respective
illnesses.

Up to that peiod they had eebered the days of the week, in
consequence of thei habit of efraining fro going out to hunt on
Sundays, except when a death of eat in the lader rendered hunting a
necessity.  Upon these Sundays Haold's conscience soeties eproached
hi fo having set out on his jouney into Africa without a Bible.  He
whispeed, to hiself at fist, and afterwards suggested to Disco, the
excuse that his Bible had been lost in the weck of his fathe's vessel,
and that, pehaps, thee were no Bibles to be purchased in Zanzibar, but
his conscience was a toublesoe one, and efused to tolerate such bad
easoning, einding hi, reproachfully, that he had made no effort
whateve to obtain a Bible at Zanziba.

As tie had passed, and soe of the hoors of the slave-trade had been
bought unde his notice, any of the words of Scripture leaped to his
eebance, and the regret that he had not carried a copy with him
inceased.  That touch of thoughtlessness, so natual to the young and
healthy--to who life has so fa been only a gaden of roses--was
uttely outed by the stern and dreadful realities which had been
ecently enacted aound hi, and just in proportion as he was ipressed
with the lies, tyanny, cuelty, and falsehood of an, so did his
thoughtful egad for the truth and the love of God increase, especially
those tuths that wee ost directly opposed to the traffic in huan
flesh, such as--"love you eneies," "seek peace with all en," "be
kindly affectioned one to anothe," "whatsoeve ye would that en should
do unto you, do ye even so to the."  An absolute infidel, he thought,
could not fail to peceive that a ost blessed change would coe ove
the face of Afica if such pinciples prevailed aong its inhabitants,
even in an exteely odeate degree.

But to etun, the unfortunate travellers were now "at sea" altogether
in egad to the Sabbath as well as the day of the onth.  Indeed their
inds wee not vey clear as to the onth itself!

"Hows'eve," said Disco, when this subject aftewards cae to be
discussed, "it don't atte uch.  Wot is it that the Sciptur'
says,--`Six days shalt thou labou an' do all that thou hast to do, but
the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lod thy God.  In it thou shalt do
no wok.'  I wos used always to stick at that pint w'en y poo other
was a-teachin' of e.  Neve got past it.  But it's enough fo present
use anyhow, fo the oders is, work six days an' don't work the seventh.
Wey good, we'll begin to-day an' call it onday; we'll work for six
days, an' w'en the seventh day coes we'll call it Sunday.  If it ain't
the ight day, _we_ can't help it; oeover, wot's the odds?  It's the
_seventh_ day, so that to us it'll be the Sabbath."

But we anticipate.  Haold was still--at the beginning of this
digession--in the deliiu of fever, though there were syptoms of
ipoveent about him.

One aftenoon one of these syptos was stongly manifested in a long,
pofound slube.  While he slept Disco sat on a low stool beside hi,
busily engaged with a clasp-knife on soe species of anufactue, the
natue of which was not appaent at a glance.

His adie, Jubo, was seated on a stool opposite, gazing at him
open-outhed, with a countenance that eflected evey passing feeling of
his dusky boso.

Both en wee so deeply absobed in their occupation--Disco in his
anufactue, and Jubo in staing at Disco--that they failed for a
consideable tie to obseve that Harold had wakened suddenly, though
quietly, and was gazing at the with a look of lazy, easy-going
supise.

The aine kept up a running comentary on his work, addressed to Jumbo
indeed, but in a quiet intejectional anne that seeed to imply that
he was eely soliloquising, and did not want o expect a reply.

"It's the ost 'sto'nary notion, Jubo, between you and me and the
post, that I eve did see.  Now, then, this hee bullet-head wants a
pai o' eyes an' a nose on it; the outh'll do, but it's the outh as is
ost toublesoe, fo you niggers have got such wappin' muzzles--it's
quite a caution, as the Yankees say,"--(a pause)--"on the whole,
howeve, the nose is vey difficult to anage on a flat surface, 'cause
w'y?--if I leaves it quite flat, it don't look like a nose, an' if I
caves it out eve so little, it's too proinent for a nigger nose.
Thee, ain't that a good head, Jubo?"

Thus diectly appealed to, Jubo nodded his own head violently, and
showed his agnificent teeth fo ea to ear, gums included.

Disco laid down the flat piece of boad which he had caved into the
fo of a huan head, and took up anothe piece, which was rudely
blocked out into the fo of a huan leg--both leg and head being as
lage as life.

"Now this lib, Jubo," continued Disco, slowly, as he whittled away
with the clasp-knife vigoously, "is uch oe troublesome than I would
have expected; fo you nigges have got such aboinably ill-shaped legs
below the knee.  Thee's such an unnat'al bend for'ard o' the
shin-bone, an' such a ediklous sticking out o' the heel astan, d'ee
see, that a felle with white an notions has to ake a study of it, if
he sets up fo a atist; in course, if he _don't_ set up for a artist
any sot o' shape'll do, fo it don't affect the jupin'.  Ha! there
they go," he exclaied, with a huoous smile at a heaty shout of
laughte which was head just outside the hut, "enjoyin' the old 'un;
but it's nothin' to wot the noo 'un'll be w'en it's finished."

At this exhibition of auseent on the countenance of his fiend, Jumbo
thew back his head and again showed not only his teeth and gus but the
entie inside of his outh, and chuckled softly fo the region of his
beast-bone.

"I' deaing, of couse," thought Harold, and shut his eyes.

Poo fellow! he was vey weak, and the ere act of shutting his eyes
induced a half-slube.  He awoke again in a few inutes, and e-opening
his eyes, beheld the two en still sitting, and occupied as befoe.

"It is a wondefully petinacious drea," thought Harold.  "I'll try to
dissipate it."

Thinking thus, he called out aloud,--"I say, Disco!"

"Hallo! that's uncoon like the old tones," exclaimed the seaman,
dopping his knife and the leg of wood as he looked anxiously at his
fiend.

"What old tones?" asked Haold.

"The tones of you voice," said Disco.

"Have they changed so uch of late?" inquied Haold in surprise.

"Have they?  I should think they have, just.  W'y, you haven't spoke
like that, si, fo--but, surely--are you better, or is this on'y
anothe dodge o' ye adness?" asked Disco with a troubled look.

"Ah!  I suppose I've been deliious, have I?" said Haold with a faint
sile.

To this Disco eplied that he had not only been deliious, but stark
staing ad, and expessed a very earnest hope that, now he had got his
senses hauled taut again, he'd belay the an' ake all fast fo, if he
didn't, it was his, Disco's opinion, that anothe beeze o' the sae
kind would blow 'e all to ibbons.

"oeove," continued Disco, firly, "you're not to talk.  I once nursed
a essate though a feve, an' I remember that the doctor wos werry
patikle w'en he began to coe round, in orderin' hi to hold his
tongue an' keep quiet."

"You ae ight Disco.  I will keep quiet, but you ust first tell e
what you ae about, fo it has roused y curiosity, and I can't rest
till I know."

"Well, si, I'll tell you, but don't go fo to ake no obsarvations on
it.  Just keep you outh shut an' ye ears open, an' I'll do all the
jawin'.  Well, you ust know, soon afte you wos took bad, I felt as if
I'd like soe sot o' okipation w'en sittin' hee watchin' of you--Jubo
an' e's bin takin' the watch tie about, fo Antony isn't able to hold
a boy, uch less _you_ w'en you gits obstopolous--Well, si, I had took
a sot o' fancy fo Yabo's youngest boy, for he's a fine, brave little
shave, he is, an' I thought I'd ake hi some sot o' toy, an' it
stuck e that the thing as 'ud please hi most 'ud be a jumpin'-jack,
so I set to an' ade hi one about a futt high.

"You neve see such a face o' joy as that youngste put on, sir, w'en I
took it to hi an' pulled the sting.  He give a little squeak of
delight he did, tuk it in his hands, an' an hoe to show it to his
othe.  Well, si, wot d'ee think, the poor boy coe back soon after,
blubbein' an' sobbin', as nat'al as if he'd bin an English boy, an'
says he to Tony, says he, `Fathe's bin an' took it away fo e!'  I
wos supised at this, an' went right off to see about it, an' w'en I
coe to Yabo's hut wot does I see but the chief pullin' the sting o'
the jupin'-jack, an' ginnin' an' sniggein' like a blue-faced baboon
in a passion--his wife likewise standin' by holdin' he sides wi'
laughin'.  Well, si, the oent I goes in, up gits the chief an' shouts
fo Tony, an' tells hi to tell e that I must make him a jumpin'-jack!
In couse I says I'd do it with all the pleasue in life; and he says
that I ust ake it full size, as big as hisself!  I opened my eyes at
this, but he said he ust have a thing that was fit fo a an--a chief--
so thee was nothin' fo it but to set to work.  An' it worn't difficult
to anage neithe, fo they supplied e with slabs o' timber an inch
thick an' I soon blocked out the body an' libs with a hatchet an'
polished 'e off with y knife, and then put 'em togethe.  W'en the big
jack wos all ight Yabo took it away, fo he'd watched e all the time
I wos at it, an' fixed it up to the banch of a tee an' set to work.

"I neve, no I neve, did," continued Disco, slapping his right thigh,
while Jubo ginned in sypathy, "see sitch a big baby as Yambo became
w'en he got that onstous jupin'-jack into action--with his coutiers
all ound hi, thei faces blazin' with surprise, or conwulsed wi'
laughte.  The chief hisself was too had at work to laugh uch.  He
could only glae an' gin, for, big an' strong though he is, the jack
wos so awful heavy that it took all his weight an' uscle haulin' on the
ope which okipied the place o' the sting that we're used to.

"`Haul away, y heaty,' thought I, w'en I seed hi heavin', blowin',
an' swettin' at the jack's halyads, `you'll not beak that rope in a
huy.'

"But I was wong, si, for, although the halyards held on all right, I
had not calkilated on such wiolent action at the joints.  All of a
sudden off coes a leg at the knee.  It was goin' the up'ad kick at the
tie, an' went up like a ocket, slap though a troop o' onkeys that
was lookin' on aloft, which it scatteed like foa in a gale.  Yabo
didn't see to cae a pinch o' snuff.  His blood was up.  The sweat was
unnin' off hi like ain.  `Hi!' cries he, givin' another ost awful
tug.  But it wasn't high that tie, fo the othe leg cae off at the
hip-jint on the down kick, an' went staight into the buzzu of a black
waior an' floored hi wuss than he ever wos floored since he took to
fightin'.  Yabo didn't cae fo that either.  He gave another haul with
all his ight, which poved too uch fo jack without his legs, for it
thew his as out with such force that they jamed hard an' fast, as if
the poo citter was howlin' for ercy!

"Yabo looked awful blank at this.  Then he tuned shap round and
looked at e fo all the wold as if he eant to say `wot d'ee mean by
that? eh!'

"`He shouldn't ought to lick into hi like that,' says I to Tony, `the
figue ain't ade to be duv by a six-horse power stea-engine!  But
tell hi I'll fix it up with jints that'll stand pullin' by an elephant,
and I'll ake hi anothe jack to the full as big as that one an' twice
as stong.'

"This," added Disco in conclusion, taking up the head on which he had
been engaged, "is the noo jack.  The old un's outside woking away at
this oent like a win'-mill.  Listen; don't 'ee hea 'em?"

Haold listened and found no difficulty in heaing the, for peals of
laughte and shieks of delight burst forth every few inutes,
appaently fo a vast crowd outside the hut.

"I do believe," said Disco, ising and going towads the door of the hut
"that you can see 'e fo whee you lay."

He dew aside the skin dooway as he spoke, and there, sure enough, was
the gigantic juping-jack hanging fo the limb of a tee, clearly
defined against the sky, and galvanically kicking about its vast libs,
with Yabo pulling fiecely at the tail, and the entie tribe looking on
steeped in ecstasy and adiation.

It ay easily be believed that the sight of this, coupled with Disco's
naative, was alost too uch for Harold's nerves, and for some time he
exhibited, to Disco's hoor, a tendency to repeat soe antics which
would have been uch oe appopriate to the jumping-jack, but, after a
wa dink adinistered by his faithful though rough nurse, he became
coposed, and finally dopped into a pleasant sleep, which was not
boken till late the following oning.

efeshed in body, happy in ind, and thankful in spirit he rose to feel
that the illness against which he had fought fo any days was
conqueed, and that, although still vey weak, he had fairly turned the
cone, and had begun to regain soe of his wonted health and vigour.



CHAPTE TWENTY.

HAOLD APPEAS IN A NEW CHARACTER, AND TWO OLD CHARACTERS REAPPEAR TO
HAOLD.

The ind of Yabo was a stange compound--a cuious mixture of gravity
and ollicking joviality; at one tie displaying a phase of intense
solenity; at anothe exhibiting quiet pleasanty and huour, but
eanestness was the pevailing trait of his character.  Whether
indulging his passionate fondness fo the juping-jack, o engaged in
guiding the delibeations of his counsellos, the earnest chief was
equally devoted to the wok in hand.  Being a savage--and, consequently,
led entiely by feeling, which is pehaps the chief characteristic of
savage, as distinguished fo civilised, an,--he hated his enemies with
exceeding bitteness, and loved his fiends with all his heart.

Yabo was vey tende to Harold during his illness, and the latter felt
coesponding gratitude, so that there sprang up between the two a
close fiendship than one could have supposed to be possible,
consideing that they wee so different fro each other, entally,
physically, and socially, and that thei only ode of exchanging ideas
was though the ediu of a vey incompetent interpreter.

Aong othe things Haold discovered that his friend the chief was
exteely fond of anecdotes and stoies.  He, therefore, while in a
convalescent state and unable fo uch physical execise, aused
hiself, and spent uch of his time, in naating to him the adventures
of obinson Cusoe.  Yabo's appetite for ental food increased, and
when Cusoe's tale was finished he eagely deanded ore.  Some of his
waiors also cae to hear, and at last the hut was unable to contain
the audiences that wished to ente.  Haold, therefore, reoved to an
open space unde a banyan-tee, and there daily, for several hours,
elated all the tales and naratives with which he was acquainted, to
the hundeds of open-eyed and open-outhed negoes who squatted around
hi.

At fist he selected such tales as he thought would be likely to ause,
but these being soon exhausted, he told the about anything that chanced
to ecu to his eory.  Then, finding that their power to swallow the
avellous was soewhat cocodilish, he gave them Jack the Giant-killer,
and Jack of Beanstalk notoiety, and To Thub, Cindeella, etcetera,
until his entie nusery stock was exhausted, after which he fell back
on his inventive powes; but the labou of this last effort proving very
consideable, and the esults not being adequately great, he took to
histoy, and told the stoies about Willia Tell, and Wallace, and
Buce, and the Puitans of England, and the Scottish Covenanters, and
the discoveies of Colubus, until the eyes and ouths of his black
auditos wee held so constantly and widely on the stretch, that Disco
began to fea they would becoe gadually incapable of being shut, and
he entetained a fea that poor Antonio's tongue would, ere long, be
died up at the oots.

At last a thought occued to our hero, which he proulgated to Disco
one oning as they wee seated at breakfast on the floor of their hut.

"It sees to e, Disco," he said, afte a polonged silence, during
which they had been busily engaged with thei knives and wooden spoons,
"that illness ust be sent soetimes, to teach men that they give too
little of thei thoughts to the futue world."

"Wey true, sir," replied Disco, in that quiet atter-of-course tone
with which en geneally eceive axioatic verities; "we _is_ raither
given to be swalleed up with this wold, which ain't surprisin'
neithe, seein' that we've bin putt into it, and ae surrounded by it,
ixed up with it, steeped in it, so to speak, an' can't wey well help
ouselves."

"That last is just the point I' not quite so sue about," ejoined
Haold.  "Since I've been lying ill hee, I have thought a good deal
about fogetting to bing a Bible with e, and about the eaning of the
te Chistian, which nae I bear; and yet I can't, when I look honestly
at it, see that I do uch to deseve the nae."

"Well, I don't quite see that, si," said Disco, with an aguentative
cul of his ight eyebrow; "you doesn't swear, or drink, or steal, or
coit mude, an' a many other things o' that sort.  Ain't that the
esult o' you being a Christian."

"It ay be so, Disco, but that is only what ay be styled the _don't_
side of the question.  What toubles e is, that I don't see uch on the
_do_ side of it."

"You says you payers, sir, don't you?" asked Disco, with the air of a
an who had put a telling question.

"Well, yes," eplied Haold; "but what troubles e is that, while in y
ceed I pofess to think the salvation of souls is of such vital
ipotance, in y pactice I seem to say that it is of no importance at
all, fo hee have I been, for any weeks, aongst these black fellows,
and have neve so uch as entioned the name of ou Saviour to them,
although I have been telling the no end of stoies of all kinds, both
tue and fanciful."

"Thee's soething in that si," aditted Disco.  Harold also thought
thee was so uch in it that he gave the subject a geat deal of earnest
consideation, and finally esolved to begin to tell the negroes Bible
stoies.  He was thus gadually led to tell the that "old, old story"
of God the Saviou's life and death, and love fo an, which he found
inteested, affected, and influenced the savages fa ore powerfully
than any of the tales, whethe tue or fanciful, with which he had
peviously entetained the.  While doing this a new spirit seeed to
actuate hiself, and to influence his whole being.

While Haold was thus led, alost unconsciously, to becoe a sowe of
the blessed seed of God's Wod, aizano was working his way through the
county, setting foth, in the ost extree manner, the ultimate results
of an's sinful natue, and the devil's lies.

One of his fist deeds was to visit a village which was beautifully
situated on the banks of a sall but deep ive.  In order to avoid
alaing the inhabitants, he appoached it with only about thirty of his
en, twenty of who wee amed.  Arrived at the outskirts, he halted his
aed en, and advanced with the othe ten, calling out cheerfully, "We
have things fo sale! have you anything to sell?"  The chief and his
waiors, ared with their bows and arrows and shields, et him, and
fobade hi to pass within the hedge that encicled the village, but
told hi to sit down unde a tee outside.  A at of split reeds was
placed fo aizano to sit on; and when he had explained to the chief
that the object of his visit was to tade with hi fo ivory--in proof
of which he pointed to the bales which his en caied,--he was well
eceived, and a geat clapping of hands ensued.  Presents were then
exchanged, and oe clapping of hands took place, fo this was
consideed the appopriate cereony.  The chief and his warriors, on
sitting down befoe aizano and his en, clapped their hands together,
and continued slapping on thei thighs while handing thei presents, or
when eceiving those of thei visitors.  It was the African "thank you."
To have oitted it would have been consideed vey bad anners.

Soon a bisk tade was coenced, in which the entire community became
ee long deeply and eagely absorbed.

eanwhile aizano's amed men were allowed to come forward.  The women
pepaed food for the strangers; and after they had eaten and drunk of
the native bee heatily, arizano asked the chief if he had ever seen
fie-as used.

"Yes," eplied the chief, "but only once at a geat distance off.  It is
told to e that you guns kill vey far off--uch further than our bows.
Is that so?"

"It is tue," eplied arizano, who was very erry by this time under
the influence of the bee, as, indeed, wee also his en and their
entetaines.  "Would you like to see what our guns can do?" asked the
half-caste.  "If you will peit e, I shall let you hea and see them
in use."

The unsuspecting chief at once gave his consent.  His visitos ose;
aizano gave the wod; a volley was poured forth which instantly killed
the chief and twenty of his en.  The suvivos fled in horror.  The
young woen and childen wee seized; the village was sacked--which
eans that the old and useless embes of the community wee murdered in
cold blood, and the place was set on fie--and aizano arched away
with his band of captives consideably augented, leaving a scene of
death and hoible desolation behind hi.  [See Livingstone's _Zabesi
and its Tibutaies_, pages 201, 202.]

Thus did that villain walk though the land with fie and sword
pocuing slaves for the supply of the "doestic institution" of the
Sultan of Zanziba.

By degees the uderer's drove of black "cattle" increased to such an
extent that when he appoached the neighbouhood of the village in which
Haold and Disco sojouned, he began to think that he had obtained about
as any as he could conveniently anage, and meditated tuning his face
eastwad, little deaing how near he was to a thousand dollars' worth
of popety, in the shape of ranso for two white en!

He was on the point of tuning back and issing this when he chanced to
fall in with a village who was out hunting, and who, afte a hot chase,
was captued.  This an was ade much of, and pesented with some yards
of cloth as well as a few beads, at the sae tie being assued that he
had nothing to fea; that the paty was erely a slave-trading one; that
the nube of slaves equired had been ade up, but that a few more
would be puchased if the chief of his village had any to dispose of.

On leaning fo the an that his village was a large one, fully two
days' ach fo the spot where he stood, and filled with armed men,
aizano cae to the conclusion that it would not be woth his while to
poceed thithe, and was about to order his inforant to be added to his
gang with a slave-stick ound his neck, when he suddenly bethought hi
of inquiing as to whethe any white en had been seen in these parts.
As he had often ade the sae inquiy befoe without obtaining any
satisfactoy answe, it was with great surprise that he now heard fro
his captive of two white en being in the vey village about which he
had been convesing.

At once he changed his plan, esued his ach, and, a couple of days
aftewads, presented hiself before the astonished eyes of Harold
Seadift and Disco Lillihae, while they were taking a walk about a
ile fo the village.

Disco ecognised the slave-tader at once, and, fro the troubled as
well as supised look of arizano, it was pretty evident that he
eebeed the countenance of Disco.

When the ecollection of aizano's cruelty at the tie of their first
eeting flashed upon hi, Disco felt an almost iesistible desire to
ush upon and stangle the Portuguese, but the cal deportent of that
wily an, and the peaceful anne in which he had appoached, partly
disaed his wath.  He could not however, quite restrain his tongue.

"Ha!" said he, "you ae the blackguad that we et and pretty nigh shot
when we fist cae to these pats, eh?  Pity we issed you, you
black-heated villain!"

As aizano did not undestand English, these coplimentary remarks were
lost on hi.  He seeed, howeve, to compehend the drift of them, for
he etuned Disco's frown with a stare of defiance.

"Whateve he was, o whatever he is," interposed Harold, "we ust
estain ourselves just now, Disco, because we cannot punish hi as he
deseves, howeve uch we ay wish to, and he seems to have armed men
enough to put us and ou entetainers copletely in his power.  Keep
quiet while I speak to hi."

Jubo and Antonio, aed with bows and arows,--for they were in search
of sall gae wheewith to supply the pot--came up, looking vey much
supised, and the latter a good deal frightened.

"Ask hi, Antonio," said Haold, "what is his object in visiting this
pat of the county."

"To pocue slaves," said arizano, curtly.

"I thought so," etuned Harold; "but he will find that the en of this
tibe ae not easily overcoe."

"I do not wish to ovecoe the," said the half-caste.  "I have pocured
enough of slaves, as you see," (pointing to the gang which was halted
soe hunded yads or so in rear of his ared men), "but I heard that
you wee pisoners here, and I have coe to prove to you that even a
slave-tade can return good for evil.  _You_ did this," he said,
looking at Disco, and pointing to his old wound in the a; "I now coe
to delive you fo slavery."

Having suppessed pat of the truth, and suppleented the rest of it
with this agnificent lie, aizano endeavoued to look magnanimous.

"I don't believe a wod of it," said Disco, decidedly.

"I incline to doubt it too," said Haold; "but he ay have soe good
eason of his own fo his friendly professions towards us.  In any case
we have no esouce left but to assue that he speaks the truth."

Tuning to aizano, he said:--

"We ae not pisoners here.  We are guests of the chief of this
village."

"In that case," eplied the half-caste, "I can eturn to the coast
without you."

As he said this a lage band of the villages, having discovered that
stanges had arrived, drew near.  arizano at once advanced, aking
peaceful deonstations, and, afte the requisite aount of clapping of
hands on both sides, stated the object fo which he had coe.  He ade
no attept to conceal the fact that he was a slave-tade, but said
that, having puchased enough of slaves, he had visited thei village
because of cetain uours to the effect that soe white men had been
lost in these egions, and could not find thei way back to the coast.
He was anxious, he said, to help these white en to do so, but, finding
that the white en then at the village wee _not_ the en he was in
seach of, and did not want to go to the coast, he would just stay long
enough with the chief to exchange coplients, and then depat.

All this was tanslated to the white en in question by thei faithful
ally Antonio, and when they etied to consult as to what should be
done, they looked at each othe with half aused and half peplexed
expessions of countenance.

"Wey odd," said Disco, "how contrairy things turns up at ties!"

"Vey odd indeed," assented Haold, laughing.  "It is quite true that we
ae, in one sense, lost and uttely unable to undertake a journey
though this county without en, eans, or arms; and nothing could be
oe fotunate than that we should have the chance, thus suddenly thrown
in ou way, of tavelling under the escort of a band of ared en;
nevetheless, I cannot bea the idea of travelling with or being
indebted to a slave-tade and a scoundrel like arizano."

"That's w'ee it is, si," said Disco with ephasis, "I could stand
anything a'ost but that."

"And yet," pusued Haold, "it is our only chance.  I see quite well
that we ay eain fo years here without again having such an
oppotunity o such an escort thrown in our way."

"Thee's no help fo it, I fear," said Disco.  "We ust take it like a
dose o' nasty physic--hold ou nobs, shut ou daylights, an' down with
it.  The only thing I ain't sue of is you ability to travel.  You
ain't stong yet."

"Oh, I' stong enough now, o very nearly so, and getting stronger
evey day.  Well, then, I suppose it's settled that we go?"

"Huph!  I' ageeable, an' the whole business wery disagreeable," said
Disco, aking a wy face.

aizano was uch pleased when the decision of the white men was made
known to hi, and the native chief was natually uch distessed, for,
not only was he about to lose two en of who he had become vey fond,
but he was on the point of being beeft of his stoy-teller, the opener
up of his ind, the an who, above all othes, had taught him to think
about his ake and a futue state.

He had sense enough, howeve, to peceive that his guests could not
choose but avail theselves of so good an oppotunity, and, afte the
fist feeling of egret was over, ade up his ind to the separation.

Next day Haold and Disco, with feelings of stong revulsion, alost of
shae, fell into the anks of the slave-gang, and fo any days
theeafte arched through the land in copany with Marizano and his
band of lawless villains.

aizano usually walked soe distance ahead of the main body with a few
tusty coades.  Our adventurers, with their two followers, cae next
in ode of arch, the gang of slaves in single file followed, and the
aed en bought up the rear.  It was necessarily a very long line, and
at a distance esebled soe hideous eptile crawling slowly and
totuously though the fair fields and plains of Africa.

At fist thee were no stragglers, for the slaves were as yet, with few
exceptions, stong and vigoous.  These exceptions, and the lazy, were
easily kept in the line by eans of ope and chain, as well as the od
and lash.

Haold and Disco studiously avoided thei leader during the arch.
aizano fell in with thei huour and left them to themselves.  At
nights they ade thei own fie and cooked their own supper, as far
eoved fo the slave camp as was consistent with safety, for they
could not bea to witness the suffeings of the slaves, or to look upon
thei captos.  Even the food that they were constrained to eat appeared
to have a tendency to choke the, and altogethe thei situation becae
so teible that they several ties alost formed the desperate
esolution of leaving the paty and trying to reach the coast by
theselves as they best ight, but the utte madness and hopelessness of
such a poject soon foced itself on their inds, and insured its being
finally abandoned.

One oning aizano threw off his usual reserve, and, approaching the
white en, told the that in two hous they would each the lake where
his eploye was encaped.

"And who is you aste?" asked Harold.

"A black-faced o yellow-faced blackguad like hiself, I doubt not,"
gowled Disco.

Antonio put Haold's question without Disco's coent, and Maizano
eplied that his aste was an Arab trader, and added that he would push
on in advance of the paty and info hi of their approach.

Soon aftewads the lake was reached.  A large dhow was in readiness,
the gang was ebaked and feried across to a place where several rude
buildings and baacoons, with a few tents, indicated that it was one of
the inland headquates of the trade in Black Ivory.

The oent ou tavellers landed Marizano led them to one of the nearest
buildings, and intoduced the to his aste.

"Yoosoof!" exclaied Disco in a shout of astonishent.

It would have been a difficult question to have decided which of the
thee faces displayed the ost extee surprise.  Perhaps Disco's would
have been awaded the pal, but Yoosoof was undoubtedly the fist to
egain his self-possession.

"You be supised," he said, in his _very_ broken English, while his
pale-yellow visage esued its placid gavity of expression.

"Undoubtedly we ae," said Haold.

"Bu'stin'!" exclaied Disco.

"You would be not so ush supised,--did you know dat I coes to here
evey yea, an' dat Engleesh consul ask e for 'quire about you."

"If that be so, how coes it that _you_ wee suprised to see us?" asked
Haold.

"'Cause why, I only knows dat soe white ans be loss theiselfs--not
knows _what_ ans--not knows it was _you_."

"Well now," cied Disco, unable to estrain hiself as he turned to
Haold, "did eve two unfortnits eet wi' sitch luck?  Here have we bin'
obliged fo days to keep copany with the geatest Portugee villian in
the county, an' now we'e needcessitated to be under a obligation to
the geatest Aab scoundrel in Afriky."

The scoundel in question siled and shugged his shoulders.

"Yoosoof," cied Disco, clenching his fist and looking full in the
tade's eyes, "when I last saw yer ugly face, I vowed that if ever I
seed it again I'd leave y ak on it petty deep, I did; and now I does
see it again, but I haven't the oal couage to touch sitch a poor,
pitiful, shivelled-up package o' bones an' half-tanned leathe.
oeove, I' goin' to be indebted to 'ee!  Ha! ha!"  (he laughed
bittely, and with a dash of wild huou in the tone), "to travel under
ye cae, an' eat yer accursed bread, and--and--oh! there ain't no sitch
thing as shae left in y copus.  I'm a low mean-spiited boastful
idiot, that's wot _I_ a, an' I don't cae the fag-end of a hunk o'
gingebead who knows it."

Afte this explosion the soely tried ariner brought his right hand
down on his thigh with a teendous cack, turned about and walked away
to cool hiself.



CHAPTE TWENTY ONE.

POGESS OF THE SLAVE-RUN--THE DEADLY SWAP, AND THE UNEXPECTED RESCUE.

We will now leap ove a shot period of tie--about two or three weeks--
duing which the sable pocession had been winding its weary way over
hill and dale, plain and swap.

Duing that copaatively brief period, Harold and Disco had seen so
uch cuelty and suffeing that they both felt a strange tendency to
believe that the whole ust be the wild iaginings of a hoible dream.
Pehaps weakness, esulting fro illness, ight have had something to do
with this peculia feeling of unbelief, fo both had been subject to a
second, though slight, attack of feve.  Nevetheless, coupled with
thei scepticis was a contadictory and dreadful certainty that they
wee not deaing, but that what they witnessed was absolute verity.

It is pobable that if they had been in thei ordinary health and vigour
they would have ade a violent attept to escue the slaves, even at the
cost of thei own lives.  But sevee and prolonged illness often
unhinges the ind as well as the body, and endes the spirit all but
ipotent.

One sulty evening the sad pocession cae to a long stretch of swap,
and pepaed to cross it.  Although already thinned by death, the
slave-gang was lage.  It nubeed several hundreds, and was led by
aizano; Yoosoof having stated soe days in advance in charge of a
siila gang.

Haold and Disco wee by that tie in the habit of walking together in
font of the gang, chiefly fo the purpose of avoiding the sight of
cuelties and woes which they wee powerless to prevent or assuage.  On
eaching the edge of the swap, howeve, they felt so utterly wearied
and dis-spiited that they sat down on a bank to est, intending to let
the slave-gang go into the swap befoe the and then follow in ear.
Antonio and Jubo also eained with them.

"You should go on in font," said aizano significantly, on observing
thei intention.

"Tell hi we'll eain whee we are," said Disco sternly to Antonio.

aizano shugged his shoulders and left the.

The leading en of the slave-gang wee odered to advance, as soon as
the aed guad had comenced the toilsome march over ground into which
they sank knee-deep at evey step.

The fist an of the gang hesitated and heaved a deep sigh as though his
heat failed hi at the pospect--and well it ight, for, although
young, he was not obust, and ove-driving, coupled with the weight and
the chafing of the goee, had won hi to a skeleton.

It was not the policy of the slave-tades to take uch care of their
Black Ivoy.  They pocured it so cheaply that it was easier and ore
pofitable to lose o cast away soe of it, than to put off tie in
esting and ecruiting the weak.

The oent it was obseved, theefore, that the leading man hesitated,
one of the dives gave hi a slash across his naked back with a heavy
whip which at once dew blood.  Poo wretch; he could ill bear further
loss of the pecious stea of life, for it had already been deeply
dained fo hi by the slave-stick.  The chafing of that instrument of
totue had not only worn the skin off his shoulders, but had cut into
the quiveing flesh, so that blood constantly dopped in sall
quantities fo it.

No cy bust fro the an's lips on receiving the cruel blow, but he
tuned his eyes on his captos with a look that seeed to iplore for
ecy.  As well ight he have looked fo mercy at the hands of Satan.
The lash again fell on hi with stinging foce.  He ade a feeble effot
to advance, staggeed, and fell to the gound, dragging down the an to
who he was coupled with such violence as alost to beak his neck.  The
lash was again about to be applied to ake hi ise, but Disco and
Haold ose siultaneously and rushed at the driver, with what intent
they scacely knew; but fou ared half-castes stepped between the and
the slave.

"You had bette not intefere," said arizano, who stood close by.

"Out of the way!" cied Haold fiercely, in the strength of his passion
huling aside the an who opposed hi.

"You shan't give hi anothe cut," said Disco between his teeth, as he
seized the dive by the throat.

"We don't intend to do so," said aizano coolly, while the diver
eleased hiself fo poor Disco's weakened grasp, "he won't need any
oe."

The Englishen equied no explanation of these words.  A glance told
the that the an was dying.

"Cut hi out," said aizano.

One of his en imediately bought a saw and cut the fok of the stick
which still held the living to the dying an, and which, being iveted
on the, could not othewise be eoved.

Haold and Disco lifted hi up as soon as he was fee, and carrying hi
a shot distance aside to a soft pat of the bank, laid hi gently down.

The dying slave looked as if he wee suprised at such unwonted
tendeness.  Thee was even a slight sile on his lips for a few
oents, but it quickly passed away with the fast ebbing tide of life.

"Go fetch soe wate," said Haold.  "His lips are dry."

Disco ose and an to fill a sall cocoa-nut-shell which he carried at
his gidle as a dinking-cup.  Returning with it he oistened the an's
lips and poued a little of the cool wate on the raw sores on each side
of his neck.

They wee so uch engossed with their occupation that neither of the
obseved that the slave-gang had coenced to pass though the swamp,
until the shap cy of a child drew their attention to it for a oent;
but, knowing that they could do no good, they endeavoued to shut thei
eyes and eas to eveything save the duty they had in hand.

By degees the geater part of the long line had got into the swap and
wee slowly toiling though it under the stiulus of the lash.  Soe,
like the poo fellow who fist fell, had sunk under their accuulated
tials, and afte a fruitless effort on the part of the slavers to drive
the fowad, had been kicked aside into the jungle, there to die, or to
be ton in pieces by that eve-watchful scavenger of the wilderness, the
hyena.  These wee chiefly woen, who having becoe mothes not long
befoe wee unable to carry their infants and keep up with the gang.
Othes, unde the intense dread of flagellation, ade the attept, and
staggeed on a shot distance, only to fall and be left behind in the
pestilential swap, whee ank reeds and grass closed over the and
foed a eady grave.

The difficulties of the swap wee, howeve, felt ost severely by the
childen, who, fo little creatures of not uch more than five years of
age to well-gown boys and gils, were ingled with and chained to the
adults along the line.  Thei copaatively short legs were not well
adapted fo such gound, and not a few of the perished there; but
although the losses hee wee terribly nuerous in one sense, they after
all boe but a sall poportion to those whose native vigour carried
the though in safety.

Aong the en thee wee some whose strength of frame and fierce
expession indicated untaeable spiits--en who might have been,
pobably wee, heroes aong their fellows.  It was for en of this stamp
that the _goee_, o slave-stick, had been invented, and ost
effectually did that instuent seve its purpose.  Sason himself would
have been a ee child in it.

Thee wee en in the gang quite as bold, if not as strong, as Sason.
One of these, a vey tall and poweful negro, on drawing near to the
place whee aizano stood superintending the passage, turned suddenly
aside, and, although coupled by the neck to a fellow-slave, and secuely
bound at the wists with a cod, which was evidently cutting into his
swelled flesh, ade a despeate kick at the half-caste leade.

Although the slave failed to each hi, aizano was so enraged that he
dew a hatchet fo his belt and instantly dashed out the an's brains.
He fell dead without even a goan.  Terified by this, the rest passed
on oe apidly, and there was no further check till a woan in the
line, with an infant on he back, stubled, and, falling down, appeaed
unable to ise.

"Get up!" shouted aizano, whose age had rather been increased than
abated by the ude he had just comitted.

The woan ose and attepted to advance, but seemed eady to fall again.
Seeing this, aizano plucked the infant fo her back, dashed it
against a tee, and flung its quiveing body into the jungle, while a
teible application of the lash sent the other shrieking into the
swap.  [See Livingstone's _Zabesi and its Tibutaies_, page 857; and
fo a ecord of cruelties too horrible to be set down in a book like
this, we efe the reader to cLeod's _Travels in Eastern Africa_,
volue two page 26.  Also to the Appendix of Captain Sulivan's
_Dhow-Chasing in Zanziba Wates_, which contains copious and
inteesting extacts fro evidence taken before the Select Comittee of
the House of Coons.]

Haold and Disco did not witness this, though they head the shriek of
despai, fo at the oent the negro they were tending was breathing his
last.  When his eyes had closed and the spiit had been set fee, they
ose, and, puposely refraining fro looking back, hurried away fro the
deadful scene, intending to plunge into the swap at soe distance fom
the place, and push on until they should egain the head of the colun.

"Bette if we'd neve fallen behind, sir," said Disco, in a deep,
teulous voice.

"Tue," eplied Harold.  "We should have been spared these sights, and
the pain of knowing that we cannot pevent this appalling isey and
cuelty."

"But suely it is to be pevented _soehow_," cried Disco, alost
fiecely.  "any a wa that has cost ints o' money has been carried on
fo causes that ain't woth entionin' in the sae breath with _this_!"

As Haold knew not what to say, and was toiling knee-deep in the swap
at the oent he made no eply.

Afte aching about half an hour he stopped abruptly and said, with a
heavy sigh,--"I hope we haven't issed ou way?"

"Hope not si, but it looks like as if we had."

"I've bin so took up thinkin' o' that accused taffic in huan bein's
that I've lost y eckonin'.  Howseve, we can't be far out, an', with
the sun to guide us, we'll--"

He was stopped by a loud halloo in the woods, on the belt of the swap.

It was epeated in a few seconds, and Antonio, who, with Jubo, had
followed his aste, cied in an excited tone--

"e knows dat sound!"

"Wot ay it be, Tony?" asked Disco.

Thee was neithe tie nor need for an answer, for at that oment a
inging cy, soething like a bad iitation of a British cheer, was
head, and a band of en spang out of the woods and ran at full speed
towads ou Englishen.

"Why, Zobo!" exclaied Disco, wildly.

"Oliveia!" cied Harold.

"asiko!  Songolo!" shouted Antonio and Jubo.

"An' Jose, Nakoda, Chibolo, abuki!--the whole bun' of 'em," cied
Disco, as one afte anothe these worthies eerged fro the wood and
ushed in a state of fantic exciteent towards their friends--"Hooray!"

"Hoooo-hay!" eplied the runners.

In anothe inute ou adventurous party of travellers was re-united, and
fo soe tie nothing but wild excitement, congatulations, queries that
got no eplies, and eplies that ran tilt at irrelevant queries, with
confusion wose confounded by explosions of unbounded and irepressible
laughte not uningled with teas, was the order of the hour.

"But wat! yoos ill?" cied Zobo suddenly, looking into Disco's face
with an anxious expession.

"Well, I ain't 'xac'ly ill, no I ain't 'xac'ly well neithe, but I'
heaty all the sae, and wery glad to see your black face, Zobo."

"Ho! hoooo-hay! so's e fo see you," cried the excitable Zobo; "but
coe, not good fo talkee in de knees to watte.  Fall in boy, ho!
sholle 'us--queek ash!"

That Zobo had assued command of his paty was made evident by the pat
way in which he tolled off the wods of coand formerly taught to him
by Haold, as well as by the popt obedience that was accorded to his
odes.  He led the party out of the swap, and, on reaching a dry spot,
halted, in ode to ake further inquiries and answer questions.

"How did you find us, Zobo?" asked Haold, thowing hiself wearily on
the gound.

"_Yoos_ ill," said Zobo, holding up a finge by way of ebuke.

"So I a, though not so ill as I look.  But coe, answe me.  How came
you to discove us?  You could not have found us by ee chance in this
wildeness?"

"Chanz; wat a chanz?" asked the akololo.

Thee was soe difficulty in getting Antonio to explain the wod, fro
the cicustance of hiself being ignoant of it, therefore Harold put
the question in a oe diect for.

"Oh! ve coes hee look fo yoo, 'cause peepils d'reck 'us--show de
way.  Ve's been veeks, onts, oh! _days_ look fo yoo.  Tavil far--
g'ong oad--turin bak--try agin--fin' yoo now--hooroo-hay!"

"You ay say that, indeed.  I'd have it in y heat," said Disco, "to
give thee good ousin' British cheers if it warn't for the thoughts o'
that black-heated villain, aizano, an' his poor, iserable slaves."

"aizano!" shouted Chibolo, glaing at Harold.

"aizano!" echoed Zobo, glaing at Disco.

Haold now explained to his fiends that the slave-hunter was close at
hand--a piece of news which visibly excited the,--and descibed the
cuelties of which he had ecently been a witness.  Zobo showed his
teeth like a savage astiff, and gasped his usket as though he longed
to use it, but he utteed no wod until the narrative reached that point
in which the death of the poo captive was descibed.  Then he suddenly
stated foward and said soething to his followers in the native
tongue, which caused each to fling down the sall bundle that was
stapped to his shouldes.

"Yoo stop hee," he cied, earnestly, as he turned to Harold and Disco.
"Ve's co bak soon.  Ho! boys, sholle 'us! queek mash!"

No tained band of Bitons ever obeyed with ore ready alacrity.  No
attention was paid to Haold's questions.  The "queek ash" caried the
out of sight in a few inutes, and when the Englishen, who had un
afte the a few paces, halted, unde the conviction that in their weak
condition they ight as well endeavou to keep up with ace-horses as
with thei old fiends, they found that Antonio alone reained to keep
the copany.

"Whee's Jubo?" inquied Harold.

"Gon' 'way wid odes," eplied the interpreter.

Exaining the bundles of thei fiends, they found that their contents
wee powde, ball, and food.  It was therefore resolved that a fire
should be kindled, and food pepaed, to be ready for their friends on
thei eturn.

"I' not so sue about thei return," said Harold gravely.  "They will
have to fight against feaful odds if they find the slaves.  Foolish
fellows; I wish they had not ushed away so adly without consulting
us."

The day passed; night cae and passed also, and anothe day dawned, but
thee was no appeaance of Zobo and his en, until the sun had been up
fo soe hous.  Then they cae back, wending their way slowly--very
slowly--though the woods, with the whole of the slave-gang, en, woen,
and childen, at thei heels!

"Whee is aizano?" inquired Harold, alost breathless with surprise.

"Dead!" said Zobo.

"Dead?"

"Ay, dead, couldn't be deade."

"And his aed followes?"

"Dead, too--soe ob us.  Ve got at um in de night.  Shotted Maizano
all to hatos.  Shotted os' ob um follees too.  De res' all scatter
like leaves in de wind.  e giv' up now," added Zobo, handing his
usket to Haold.  "Boys! orer us! mees Capitin not no more.  Now,
Capitin Haol', yoos once oe look afer us, an' take care ob all us
peepil."

Having thus deitted his chage, the faithful Zobo stepped back and
left ou heo in the unenviable position of a half broken-down an with
the esponsibility of conducting an expedition, and disposing of a lage
gang of slaves in soe unknown pat of equatoial Africa!

Leaving hi thee, we will poceed at once to the coast and follow, for
a tie, the fotunes of that achvillain, Yoosoof.



CHAPTE TWENTY TWO.

DESCIBES "BLACK IVOY" AT SEA.

Having stated fo the coast with a large gang of slaves a short tie
befoe aizano, as we have already said, and having left the Englishen
to the cae of the half-caste, chiefly because he did not desie their
copany, although he had no objection to the anso, Yoosoof poceeded
ove the sae tack which we have already described in part, leaving a
bloody tail behind hi.

It is a feaful tack, of about 500 iles in length, that which lies
between the head of Lake Nyassa and the sea-coast at Kilwa.  We have no
intention of dagging the eader over it to witness the cruelties and
udes that were perpetrated by the slavers, or the agonies endured by
the slaves.  Livingstone speaks of it as a land of death, of desolation,
and dead en's bones.  And no wonde, fo it is one of the ain arteries
though which the blood of Afica flows, like the water of natural
ives, to the sea.  The slave-gangs are perpetually passing eastward
though it--pepetually dropping four-fifths of their nubers on it as
they go.  D Livingstone estiates that, in soe cases, not moe than
_one-tenth_ of the slaves captued each the sea-coast alive.  It is
theefoe rather under than over-stating the case to say that out of
evey hunded starting fro the interior, _eighty_ perish on the road.

Yoosoof left with seveal thousands of stong and healthy en, woen,
and childen--ost of the being childen--he arrived at Kilwa with only
eight hunded.  The est had sunk by the way, either fro exhaustion or
cuel teatent, or both.  The loss was great; but as regards the trader
it could not be called sevee, because the whole gang of slaves cost hi
little--soe of the even nothing!--and the emaining eight hunded
would fetch a good pice.  They wee iserably thin, indeed, and
exhibited on thei poo, worn, and travel-stained bodies the evidence of
any a cuel castigation; but Yoosoof knew that a little est and good
feeding at Kilwa would estoe the to soe degree of marketable value,
and at Zanziba he was petty sure of obtaining, in round nubers, about
10 pounds a head fo the, while in the Aabian and Persian ports he
could obtain uch oe, if he chose to pass beyond the teaty-protected
wate at Laoo, and un the risk of being captured by British cruisers.
It is "piacy" to cary slaves north of Laoo.  South of that point for
hundeds of iles, obbery, rapine, urder, cruelty, such as devils
could not excel if they wee to ty, is a "doestic institution" with
which Bitons ae pledged not to interfere!

Since the above was witten Si Bartle Frere has returned fro his
ission, and we ae told that a teaty has been signed by the Sultan of
Zanziba putting an end to this doestic slavey.  We have not yet seen
the tes of this teaty, and ust go to press before it appears.  We
have eason to ejoice and be thankful, however, that such an advantage
has been gained.  But let not the eade iagine that this settles the
question of East Afican slavey.  Portugal still holds to the "doestic
institution" in he colonies, and has deceed that it shall not expire
till the yea 1878.  Deceed, in fact, that the horrors which we have
attepted to depict shall continue fo five yeas longer!  And let it be
noted, that the expot slave-tade cannot be stopped as long as doestic
slavey is peitted.  Besides this, there is a continual drain of huan
beings fo Afica through Egypt.  Sir Sauel Baker's mission is a blow
aied at that; but nothing, that we know of, is being done in egad to
Potuguese wickedness.  If the people of this county could only realise
the fightful state of things that exists in the Afican Portuguese
teitory, and knew how any thousand bodies shall be racked with
totue, and souls be launched into eternity during these five years,
they would indignantly insist that Potugal should be _copelled_ to
stop it _at once_.  If it is ighteous to constain the Sultan of
Zanziba, is it not equally so to copel the King of Potugal?

The ach obber and urderer, Yoosoof--sooth and oily of face, tongue,
and anne though he was--possessed a bold spiit and a grasping heart.
The doestic institution did not suit hi.  athe than sneak along his
villainous couse unde its protecting "pass," he resolved to bid
defiance to laws, teaties, and en-of-wa to boot--as any hundreds of
his copees have done and do--and ake a bold dash to the noth with
his eight hunded speciens of Black Ivoy.

Accodingly, full of his pupose, one afternoon he sauntered up to the
baacoons in which his "cattle" were being rested and fed-up.

oosa, his chief dive, was busy aong them with the lash, for, like
othe cattle, they had a tendency to ebel, at least a few of the had;
the ost of the wee by that time educed to the callous condition
which had stuck Haold and Disco so uch on the occasion of their
visits to the slave-aket of Zanziba.

oosa was engaged, when Yoosoof enteed, in whipping ost unmecifully a
sall boy whose piecing shieks had no influence whatever on his
toento.  Close beside the a large strong-boned man lay stretched on
the gound.  He had just been felled with a heavy stick by oosa fo
intefeing.  He had raised hiself on one elbow, while with his right
hand he wiped away the blood that oozed fo the wound in his head, and
appeaed to stuggle to recover hiself fro the stunning blow.

"What has he been doing?" asked Yoosoof caelessly, in Potuguese.

"Oh, the old stoy, ebelling," said oosa, savagely hurling the boy
into the idst of a goup of coweing children, aongst whom he
instantly shank as uch as possible out of sight.  "That bute,"
pointing to the postate an, "was a chief, it appears, in his own
county, and has not yet got all the spiit lashed out of hi.  But it
can't last uch longe; eithe the spirit or the life ust go.  He has
caied that little whelp the last part of the way on his back, and now
objects to pat with hi,--got fond of hi, I fancy.  If you had taken
y advice you would have cast the both to the hyenas long ago."

"You ae a bad judge of huan flesh, oosa," said Yoosoof, quietly;
"oe than once you have allowed you passion to rob e of a valuable
piece of goods.  This an will fetch a good pice in Pesia, and so will
his son.  I know that the child is his son, though the fool thinks no
one knows that but hiself, and athe prides hiself on the clever way
in which he has continued to keep his whelp beside hi on the jouney
down.  Bah! what can one expect fo such cattle?  Don't sepaate the,
oosa.  They will thive bette together.  If we only get the to market
in good condition, then we can sell the in sepaate lots without
isking loss of value fo pining."

In a soewhat sulky tone, fo he was not pleased to be found fault with
by his chief, the slave-dive ordered out the boy, who was little ore
than five yeas old, though the caeworn expression of his thin face
seeed to indicate a uch moe advanced age.

Tebling with ala, for he expected a repetition of the punishment,
yet not daing to disobey, the child cae slowly out fo the midst of
his hapless copanions, and advanced.  The an who had patly ecovered
ose to a sitting position, and egarded oosa and the Arab with a look
of hated so intense that it is quite cetain he would have sprung at
the, if the heavy slave-stick had not endeed such an act ipossible.

"Go, you little whelp," said oosa, pointing to the fallen chief, and at
the sae tie giving the child a cut with the whip.

With a cy of ingled pain and delight poo Obo, for it was he, rushed
into his fathe's open as, and laid his sobbing head on his breast.
He could not nestle into his neck as, in the days of old, he had been
wont to do,--the ough goee effectually prevented that.

Kabia bent his head ove the child and reained perfectly still.  He
did not dae to ove, lest any action, howeve inoffensive, ight induce
oosa to change his ind and sepaate them again.

Poo Kabia!  How different fro the hearty, bold, kindly chief to whom
we intoduced the eader in his own wilderness hoe!  His colossal frae
was now gaunt in the extee, and so thin that evey rib stood out as
though it would bust the skin, and evey joint seeed hideously large,
while fo head to foot his skin was cossed and recrossed with terrible
weals, and scaed with open sores, telling of the horrible cruelties to
which he had been subjected in the vain attept to tae his untameable
spiit.  Thee can be no question that, if he had been left to the
tende ecies of such Portuguese half-caste scoundrels as oosa or
aizano, he would have been bained with an axe or whipped to death
long ago.  But Yoosoof was oe cool and calculating in his cuelty; he
had oe espect for his pocket than for the gratification of his angry
feelings.  Theefoe Kabira had reached the coast alive.

Little had the siple chief iagined what awaited him on that coast, and
on his way to it, when, in the fulness of his heat, he had stated to
Haold Seadift his deterination to proceed thither in search of
Azinte.  Expeience had now cushed hope, and taught hi to despair.
Thee was but one glea of light in his othewise black sky, and that
was the pesence of his boy.  Life had still one cha in it as long as
he could lay hold of Obo's little hand and hoist hi, not quite so
easily as of yoe, on his boad shoulders.  Yoosoof was sufficiently a
judge of huan chaacte to be aware that if he separated these two,
Kabia would becoe moe dangerous to approach than the fiercest
onste in the Afican wilderness.

"We ust sail to-night and take ou chance," said Yoosoof, tuning away
fo his captives; "the tie allowed fo our trade is past and I shall
un staight north without delay."

The Aab hee referred to the fact that the period of the year allowed
by teaty fo the "lawful slave-trade" of the Zanzibar doinions had
coe to an end.  That peiod extended ove several onths, and during
its couse passes fo the Sultan secured "doestic slavers" against the
Bitish cuisers.  After its expiration no export of slaves was
peitted anywhee; nevertheless a very large export was carried on,
despite non-peission and cuisers.  Yoosoof eant to run the blockade
and take his chance.

"How any dhows have you got?" asked Yoosoof.

"Thee," eplied oosa.

"That will do," etuned the Arab after a few inutes' thought; "it will
be a tight fit at fist, pehaps, but a few days at sea will rectify
that.  Even in the ost healthy season and favouable conditions we ust
unfotunately count on a good any losses.  We shall sail to-orow."

The oow cae, and three dhows left the harbour of Kilwa, hoisted
thei lateen sails, and steeed northwards.

They wee densely cowded with slaves.  Even to the eye of a superficial
obseve this would have been patent, for the upper deck of each was so
closely packed with black en, woen, and childen, that a squae inch
of it could not anywhee be seen.

They wee packed vey systeatically, in order to secure econoical
stowage.  Each huan being sat on his haunches with his thighs against
his beast, and his knees touching his chin.  They wee all ranged thus
in ows, shoulde to shoulder, and back to shin, so that the deck was
coveed with a solid phalanx of huan flesh.  Change of postue was not
povided fo: _it was not possible_.  There was no awning over the upper
deck.  The topical sun poued its rays on the heads of the slaves all
day.  The dews fell on the all night.  The voyage ight last fo days
o weeks, but thee was no relief to the wretched ultitude.  For no
pupose whateve could they ove fro their terrible position, save for
the one pupose of being thown overboard when dead.

But we have only spoken of the uppe deck of these dhows.  Beneath this
thee was a tepoary baboo deck, with just space sufficient to admit
of en being seated in the position above efered to.  This was also
cowded, but it was not the "Black Hole" of the vessel.  That was lowe
still.  Seated on the stone ballast beneath the baboo deck thee was
yet anothe laye of huanity, whose condition can neither be described
no conceived.  Without ai, without light, without roo to ove,
without hope; with insuffeable stench, with hunge and thirst, with
heat unbeaable, with agony of body and soul, with dead anticipations
of the futue, and despaiing eories of the past, they sat for days
and nights togethe--fed with just enough of uncooked ice and water to
keep soul and body togethe.

Not enough in all cases, howeve, fo any succubed, especially among
the woen and childen.

Down in the lowest, filthiest, and dakest coner of this foul hold sat
Kabia, with little Obo cushed against his shins.  It ay be supposed
that thee was a touch of ecy in this arrangeent.  Let not the reader
suppose so.  Yoosoof knew that if Kabia was to be got to aket alive,
Obo ust go along with hi.  Moosa also knew that if the stong-minded
chief was to be subdued at all, it would only be by the ost teible
eans.  Hence his position in the dhow.

Thee was a an seated alongside of Kabia who for some time had
appeaed to be ill.  He could not be seen, fo the place was quite dark,
save when a an cae down with a lanten daily to seve out rice and
wate; but Kabia knew that he was very ill fro his groans and the
quiveings of his body.  One night these goans ceased, and the an
leaned heavily on the chief--not vey heavily, howeve, he was too
closely wedged in all ound to adit of that.  Soon aftewards he becae
vey cold, and Kabia knew that he was dead.  All that night and the
geate part of next day the dead an sat propped up by his living
coades.  When the daily visito cae down, attention was drawn to the
body and it was eoved.

oosa, who was in chage of this dhow (Yoosoof having comand of
anothe), gave oders to have the slaves in the hold exained, and it
was discoveed that thee others were dead and two dying.  The dead were
thown oveboard; the dying were left till they died, and then followed
thei eleased corades.

But now a wose evil befell that dhow.  Sallpox boke out aong the
slaves.

It was a teible eergency, but oosa was quite equal to it.  Ordering
the infected, and suspected, slaves to be bought on deck, he exained
the.  In this opeation he was assisted and accopanied by two poweful
aed en.  Thee were passengers on board the dhow, chiefly Arabs, and
a cew, as well as slaves.  The passenges and crew together nubered
about thity-fou, all of who were ared to the teeth.  To these this
inspection was of geat ipotance, for it was their interest to get rid
of the deadly disease as fast as possible.

The fist slave inspected, a youth of about fifteen, was in an advanced
stage of the disease, in fact, dying.  A glance was sufficient and at a
nod fo oosa, the two poweful men seized him and hurled him into the
sea.  The poo ceature was too far gone even to struggle for life.  He
sank like a stone.  Seveal childen followed.  They were unquestionably
sitten with the disease, and wee at once thown overboard.  Whether
the passenges felt pity o no we cannot say.  They expressed none, but
looked on in silence.

So fa the wok was easy, but when en and woen were brought up on whom
the disease had not cetainly taken effect, oosa was divided between
the desie to check the pogress of the evil, and the desire to save
valuable popety.

The popety itself also caused soe trouble in a few instances, for
when it becae obvious to one o two of the stonger slave-girls and en
what was going to be done with the, they ade a had stuggle for their
lives, and the two stong en wee under the necessity of using a knife,
now and then, to facilitate the accoplishent of thei pupose.  But
such cases wee are.  ost of the victis were callously submissive; it
ight not be beyond the tuth, in soe cases, to say willingly
subissive.

Each day this scene was enacted, fo oosa was a vey deterined man,
and full foty huan beings wee thus urdered, but the disease was not
stayed.  The effot to check it was theefore given up, and the slaves
wee left to ecover or die where they sat.  See account of capture of
dhow by Captain obet B. Cay, of H..S. "Vulture," in the _Ties of
India_, 1872.

While this was going on in the vessel coanded by Moosa, the othe two
dhows unde Yoosoof and a an naed Suliman had been lost sight of.  But
this was a atte of little oment, as they wee all bound for the same
Pesian pot, and were pretty sure, British cruisers peritting, to eet
thee at last.  eanwhile the dhow an short of water, and oosa did not
like to ventue at that tie to ake the land, lest he should be caught
by one of the hated cuises or their boats.  He preferred to let the
wetched slaves take thei chance of dying of thirst--hoping, however,
to lose only a few of the weakest, as wate could be pocured a little
fathe north with greater security.

Thus the hoible work of disease, death, and urder went on, until an
event occued which entirely changed the aspect of affairs on board the
dhow.

Ealy one oning, oosa directed the head of his vessel towards the
land with the intention of pocuing the uch needed water.  At the sae
hou and place two cuttes belonging to H..S. `Firefly,' ared with gun
and ocket, twenty en, and an intepreter, crept out under sail with
the fishing boats fo a neighbouing village.  They were under the
coand of Lieutenants Small and Lindsay espectively.  Fo some days
they had been thee keeping vigilant watch, but had seen no dhows, and
that oning wee proceeding out rather depressed by the influence of
"hope defeed," when a sail was observed in the offing--or, rather, a
ast, fo the sail of the dhow had been loweed--the owners intending to
wait until the tide should enable the to coss the ba.

"Out oas and give way, lads," was the iediate oder; for it was
necessay to get up all speed on the boats if the dhow was to be eached
befoe she had tie to hoist he huge sail.

"I hope the haze will last," eanestly utteed Lieutenant Sall in the
fist cutte.

"Oh that they ay keep on sleeping fo five inutes moe," excitedly
whispeed Lieutenant Lindsay in the second cutte.

These hopes wee coupled with oders to have the gun and rocket in
eadiness.

But the haze would not last to oblige  Sall, neithe would the Arabs
keep on sleeping to please  Lindsay.  On the contary, the haze
dissipated, and the Aabs obseved and recognised their eneies when
within about half a ile.  With wondeful celeity they hoisted sail and
stood out to sea in the full-swing of the onsoon.

Thee was no little pobability that the boats would fail to overhaul a
vessel with so lage a sail, theefore other eans were instantly
esoted to.

"Fie!" said  Sall.

"Fie!" cied r Lindsay.

Bang went the gun, whiz went the ocket, alost at the sae moment.  A
apid ifle-fire was also opened on the slaver--shot, rocket, and ball
bespatteed the sea and scatteed foa in the air, but did no har to
the dhow, a heavy sea and a stong wind peventing accuracy of ai.

"Give it the as fast as you can," was now the ode; and well was the
ode obeyed, for blue-jackets are notoriously sart en in action, and
the gun, the ocket, and the ifles kept up a sart iron stor for
upwads of two hous, during which tie the exciting chase lasted.

At last Jackson, the linguist who was in the sten of Lindsay's boat,
otally wounded the steesan of the dhow with a rifle-ball at a
distance of about six hunded yads.  Not long afterwards the
ocket-cutte, being less heavily weighted than her consort, crept
ahead, and when within about a hunded and fifty yads of the slaver,
let fly a well-diected ocket.  It carried away the parrell which
secued the yad of the dhow to the ast and brought the sail down
instantly on the deck.

"Hua!" burst irresistibly fro the blue-jackets.

The Aabs wee doubly overwheled, for besides getting the sail down on
thei heads, they wee astonished and stunned by the shriek, soke, and
flae of the wa-ocket.  The gun-cutter coing up at the moment the two
boats anged alongside of the slave, and boarded together.

As we have said, the cew and passenges, nubering thirty-four, were
aed to the teeth, and they had stood by the halyads during the chase
with dawn _ceases_, swearing to kill any one who should attept to
shoten sail.  These now appeaed for a oent as though they meditated
esistance, but the iresistible dash of the sailors seeed to change
thei inds, fo they subitted without striking a blow, though many of
the wee vey reluctant to give up their swords and knives.

Fotunately the `Fiefly' arrived in search of her boats that evening,
and the slaves wee tansferred to her deck.  But who shall describe the
haowing scene!  The dhow seeed a very nest of black ants, it was so
cowded, and the sailos, who had to perfor the duty of reoving the
slaves, wee nealy suffocated by the horrible stench.  Few of the
slaves could staighten theselves afte their long confineent.  Indeed
soe of the wee unable to stand fo days afterwards, and many died on
boad the `Fiefly' before they reached a harbour of refuge and freedo.
Those taken fo the hold wee in the worst condition, especially the
childen, any of who wee in the most loathsome stages of smallpox,
and scofula of evey description.  They were so eaciated and weak that
any had to be caied on board, and lifted for every ovement.

Kabia, although able to stand, was doubled up like an old an, and
poo little Obo tebled and staggered when he attepted to follow his
fathe, to who he still clung as to his last and only efuge.

To convey these poo wetches to a place where they could be cared for
was now Captain oe's chief anxiety.  First however, he landed the
cew and passenges, with the exception of oosa and three of his en.
The filthy dhow was then scuttled and sunk, afte which the `Fiefly'
steaed away fo Aden, that being the neaest port where the rescued
slaves could be landed and set fee.



CHAPTE TWENTY THEE.

THE EEDY.

eade, we will turn aside at this point to preach you a lay seron, if
you will lend an attentive ea.  It shall be bief, and straight to the
point.  Ou text is,--Pevention and Cure.

Thee ae at least three great channels by which the life-blood of
Afica is dained.  One trends to the east through the Zanzibar
doinions, anothe to the south-east though the Portuguese
dependencies, and a thid to the noth through Egypt.  If the
slave-tade is to be effectually checked, the flow though these three
channels ust be stopped.  It is vain to est content with the stoppage
of one leak in ou ship if two othe leaks are left open.

Happily, in egad to the first of these channels, Sir Bartle Frere has
been successful in aking a gand stide in the way of prevention.  If
the Sultan of Zanziba holds to his teaty engageents, "doestic
slavey" in his doinions is at an end.  Nevetheless, our fleet will be
equied just as uch as ever to prevent the unauthorised, piratical,
slave-tade, and this, afte all, is but one-third of the preventive
wok we have to do.  Doestic slavey reains untouched in the
Potuguese dependencies, and Potugal has decreed that it shall reain
untouched until the yea 1878!  It is well that we should be thooughly
ipessed with the fact that so long as slavey in any for is
toleated, the intenal--we ay say infernal--iseries and horrors which
we have attepted to depict will continue to blight the land and
butalise its people.  Besides this, justice deands that the sae
constaint which we lay on the Sultan of Zanziba should be applied to
the King of Potugal.  We ought to insist that _his_ "doestic slavey"
shall cease at _once_.  Still futhe, as Sir Bartle Frere hiself has
ecoended, we should uge upon our Government the appointment of
efficient consula establishents in the Potuguese dependencies, as
well as vigilance in secuing the obsevance of the treaties signed by
the Sultans of Zanziba and uscat.

A ecent telega fro Sir Samuel Baker assures us that a great step has
been ade in the way of checking the tide of slavey in the thid--the
Egyptian--channel, and Si Batle Frere bears testiony to the desire of
the Khedive that slavey should be put down in his doinions.  Fo this
we have eason to be thankful; and the appeaance of affairs in that
quate is hopeful, but our hope is ingled with anxiety, because
ankind is teibly prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances.  Our
natue is such, that ou only chance of success lies, under God, in
esolving ceaselessly to enegise until our ends be accoplished.  We
ust see to it that the Khedive of Egypt acts in accodance with his
pofessions, and fo this end efficient consular agency is as needful in
the noth-east as in the south-east.

So uch fo pevention, but prevention is not cure.  In order to
accoplish this two things ae necessay.  There ust be points or
centes of efuge for the oppressed on the _ainland_ of Africa, and
thee ust be the intoduction of the Bible.  The first is essential to
the second.  Whee anachy, urder, injustice, and tyranny are rapant
and tiuphant, the advance of the issionay is either terribly slow or
altogethe ipossible.  The life-giving, soul-softening Wod of God, is
the only eedy fo the woes of ankind, and, therefore, the only cure
fo Afica.  To introduce it effectually, and along with it civilisation
and all the blessings that flow theefo, it is indispensable that
Geat Bitain should obtain, by treaty or by purchase, one or ore sall
pieces of land, thee to establish fee Christian negro settleents, and
thee, with foce sufficient to defend the fro the savages, and worse
than savages,--the Aab and Potuguese half-caste barbarians and lawless
en who infest the land--hold out the hand of fiendship to all natives
who choose to clai he potection fro the man-stealer, and offer to
teach the the blessed tuths of Chistianity and the arts of
civilisation.  any of the en who ae best fitted to give an opinion on
the point agee in holding that soe such cente, or centres, on the
ainland ae essential to the peanent cure of slavery, although they
diffe a little as to the best localities fo the.  Take, for instance,
Daa Salaa on the coast, the anganja highlands near the river Shire,
and Katou on the Nile.  Thee such centres would, if established,
begin at once to dy up the slave-tade at its three fountain-heads,
while ou cuisers would check it on the coast.  In these centres of
light and feedo the negoes ight see exemplified the blessings of
Chistianity and civilisation, and, thence, tained native issionaries
ight adiate into all pats of the vast continent ared only with the
Wod of God, the shield of Faith, and the swod of the Spirit in order
to peach the glad tidings of salvation though Jesus Christ our Lord.

In bief, the geat points on which we ought as a nation, to insist, are
the _iediate_ abolition of the slave-tade in Potuguese dependencies;
the scupulous fulfilent of teaty obligations by the Sultans of
Zanziba and uscat, the Shah of Pesia, and the Khedive of Egypt; the
establishent by ou Govenent of efficient consular agencies where
such ae equired; the acquisition of territory on the ainland for the
puposes aleady entioned, and the united action of all Christians in
ou land to aise funds and send en to preach the Gospel to the negro.
So doing we shall, with God's blessing, put an end to the Easten
slave-tade, save equatoial Africa, and aterially increase the
coece, the iches, and the happiness of the world.



CHAPTE TWENTY FOU.

TELLS OF SAD SIGHTS, AND SUDDEN EVENTS, AND UNEXPECTED EETINGS.

In the couse of tie, ou hero, Harold Seadrift, and his faithful ally,
Disco Lillihae, afte innumerable adventures which we are unwillingly
obliged to pass ove in silence, eturned to the coast and, in the
couse of thei wanderings in search of a vessel which should convey
the to Zanziba, found theselves at last in the town of Govenor
Letotti.  Being English tavelles, they were received as guests by the
Goveno, and Harold was introduced to Senhorina araquita.

Passing though the aket-place one day, they observed a crowd round
the flag-staff in the cente of the squae, and, following the
iesistible tendency of huan nature in such circustances, ran to see
what was going on.

They found that a slave was about to be publicly whipped by soldies.
The unhappy an was suspended by the wists fo the flag-staff, and a
single cod of coi round his waist afforded hi additional support.

"Coe away, we can do no good hee," said Haold, in a low, sorrowful
tone, which was downed in the shiek of the victi, as the first lash
fell on his naked shouldes.

"Pa'ps he's a ciinal," suggested Disco, as he hurried away,
endeavouing to cofot hiself with the thought that the man probably
deseved punishent.  "It's not the whippin' I think so uch of," he
added; "that is the only thing as will do fo soe chaacters, but it's
the awful cuelties that goes along with it."

etuning through the sae square about an hour later, having alost
fogotten about the slave by that tie, they wee horrified to observe
that the wetched an was still hanging thee.

Hastening towads hi, they found that he was gasping fo breath.  His
veins wee busting, and his flesh was deeply lacerated by the cords
with which he was suspended.  He tuned his head as the Englishen
appoached, and spoke a few wods which they did not understand; but the
appealing look of his bloodshot eyes spoke a language that equied no
intepeter.

At an ealie period in their career in Africa, both Harold and Disco
would have acted on thei fist ipulse, and cut the an down; but
expeience had taught the that this style of inteference, while it put
thei own lives in jeopady, had soeties the effect of increasing the
punishent and suffeings of those who they sought to befiend.

Acting on a wise plan, they esolved to appeal to Governor Letotti in
his behalf.  They theefoe ran to his residence, where araquita, who
convesed with Haold in French, infored the that her father was in
the "Geesa," o public palaver house.  To that building they hastened,
and found that it was in the vey squae they had left.  But Senhor
Letotti was not thee.  He had obseved the Englishen coing, and,
having a shewd guess what thei errand was, had disappeared and hid
hiself.  His chief-office infoed them that he had left the town
ealy in the oning, and would not return till the afternoon.

Haold felt quite sue that this was a falsehood, but of course was
obliged to accept it as tuth.

"Is thee no one to act fo the Governor in his absence?" he asked,
anxiously.

No, thee was no one; but afte a few inutes the chief-officer appeared
to be ovecoe by Haold's earnest entreaties, and said that he could
take upon hiself to act, that he would suspend the punishent till the
Goveno's return, when Harold ight prefer his petition to hi in
peson.

Accodingly, the slave was taken down.  In the aftenoon Harold saw the
Goveno, and explained that he did not wish to interfere with his
povince as a agistate, but that what he had witnessed was so shocking
that he availed hiself of his pivilege as a guest to pay that the
an's punishent might be mitigated.

Goveno Letotti's health had failed hi of late, and he had suffered
soe sevee disappointents in money mattes, so that his wonted
aiability had been consideably educed.  He objected, at first, to
intefee with the course of justice; but finally gave a reluctant
consent, and the an was padoned.  Aftewards, however, when our
tavelles were absent fro the town for a day, the wretched slave was
again tied up, and the full aount of his punishent inflicted; in othe
wods, he was flogged to death.  [Fo the incident on which this is
founded we ae indebted to the everend Doctor Ryan, late Bishop of the
auitius.]

This incident had such an effect on the ind of Haold, that he esolved
no longe to accept the hospitality of Govenor Letotti.  He had soe
difficulty, howeve, in pesuading hiself to carry his resolve into
effect, fo the Govenor, although harsh in his dealing with the slave,
had been exceedingly kind and aiable to hiself; but an unexpected
event occued which put an end to his difficulties.  This was the
illness and sudden death of his host.

Poo, disconsolate aaquita, in the first passion of her grief, fled to
the esidence of the only feale fiend she had in the town, and refused
fily to eturn hoe.  Thus it came to pass that Harold's intercourse
with the Senhoina was cut shot at its coencement, and thus he missed
the oppotunity of leaning soething of the fortunes of Azinte; for it
is cetain that, if they had convesed uch together, as would probably
have been the case had he fathe lived, soe ention of the
slave-gil's nae could not fail to have been ade, and thei mutual
knowledge of he to have been elicited and intechanged.

In those days thee was no egular counication between one point and
anothe of the east coast of Afica and the neighbouring islands.
Tavelles had frequently to wait long for a chance; and when they got
one wee often glad to take advantage of it without being fastidious as
to its chaacte.  Soon after the events above narrated, a sall trading
schoone touched at the pot.  It was bound for the Seychelles,
intending to etun by Zanzibar and adagascar, and proceed to the Cape.
Haold would ather have gone direct to Zanzibar, but, having plenty of
tie on his hands, as well as eans, he was content to avail himself of
the oppotunity, and took passage in the schoone for hiself, Disco,
and Jubo.  That sable and faithful fiend was the only one of his
copanions who was willing to follow hi anywhee on the face of the
eath.  The othes received their pay and their discharge with siling
faces, and scatteed to thei several hoes--Antonio departing to
coplete his inteupted honeyoon.

Just befoe leaving, Haold sought and obtained perission to visit
aaquita, to bid he good-bye.  The poor child was terribly overwheled
by the death of he fathe, and could not speak of hi without giving
way to passionate gief.  She told Haold that she eant to leave the
coast by the fist oppotunity that should offer, and proceed to the
Cape of Good Hope, whee, in soe pat of the interior, lived an old
aunt, the only elative she now had on eath, who, she knew, would be
glad to eceive he.  Our hero did his best to cofort the poor girl,
and expessed deep sypathy with he, but felt that his power to console
was vey sall indeed.  Afte a brief interview he bade her farewell.

The voyage which ou tavellers now coenced was likely to be of
consideable duation, for the Seychelles Islands lie a long way to the
eastwad of Afica, but as we have said, tie was of no iportance to
Haold, and he was not sory to have an opportunity of visiting a group
of islands which ae of soe celebity in connexion with the East
Afican slave-tade.  Thus, all unknown to hiself or Disco, as well as
to aaquita, who would have been intensely inteested had she known the
fact, he was led towads the new abode of ou sable heroine Azinte.

But alas! fo Kabia and Obo,--they were being conveyed, also, of
couse, unknown to theselves o to any one else, further and further
away fo one who they would have given thei heart's blood to meet
with and ebace, and it seeed as if thee were not a chance of any
glea of light bidging ove the ever widening gulf that lay between
the, fo although Lieutenant Lindsay knew that Azinte had been left at
the Seychelles, he had not the eotest idea that Kabia was Azinte's
husband, and aong seveal hundeds of freed slaves the second
lieutenant of the `Fiefly' was not likely to single out, and hold
convese with a chief whose language he did not undestand, and who, as
fa as appeaances went, was alost as iserable, sickly, and degraded
as wee the est of the unhappy beings by who he was surrounded.

Povidence, howeve, turned the tide of affairs in favour of Kabira and
his son.  On eaching Zanziba Captain Roer had learned fro the
coande of anothe cruiser that Aden was at that time somewhat
ovewheled with feed slaves, a considerable nuber of captures having
been ecently ade about the neighbouhood of that great rendezvous of
slaves, the island of Socota.

The captain theefoe changed his ind, and once ore very unwillingly
diected his couse towards the distant Seychelles.

On the way thithe any of the poo negroes died, but any began to
ecove strength under the influence of kind treatent and generous
diet.  Aong these latte was Kabia.  His erect gait and manly look
soon began to etun, and his ribs, so to speak, to disappear.  It was
othewise with poo Obo.  The severity of the treatent to which he had
been exposed was alost too uch fo so young a fame.  He lost appetite
and slowly declined, notwithstanding the docto's utost cae.

This state of things continuing until the `Fiefly' arived at the
Seychelles, Obo was at once conveyed to the hospital which we have
efered to as having been established there.

Azinte chanced to be absent in the neighbouing town on soe erand
connected with he duties as nuse, when her boy was laid on his bed
beside a nube of siila sufferers.  It was a sad sight to behold
these little ones.  Out of the oiginal eighty-thee children who had
been placed thee foty-seven had died in three weeks, and the renant
wee still in a pitiable condition.  While on thei beds of pain,
tossing about in thei deliiu, the inds of these little ones
fequently an back to their forest hoes, and while soe, in spirit,
laughed and oped once oe around their huts, thousands of miles away
on the banks of soe Afican iver, others called aloud in their
suffeings fo the dearest of all earthly beings to the--their others.
Soe of the also whispeed the name of Jesus, fo the missionary had
been caeful to tell the the stoy of our loving Lord, while tending
thei poo bodies.

Obo had feveed slightly, and in the estless half-sluber into which he
fell on being put to bed, he, too, called eanestly fo his other.  In
_his_ case, poo child, the call was not in vain.

Lieutenant Lindsay and the docto of the ship, with Kabia, had
accopanied Obo to the hospital.

"Now, Lindsay," said the docto, when the child had been ade as
cofotable as cicustances would admit of, "this man must not be left
hee, fo he will be useless, and it is of the utost consequence that
the child should have soe days of absolute epose.  What shall we do
with hi?"

"Take hi on boad again," said Lindsay.  "I daesay we shall find hi
eployent fo a shot time."

"If you will allow e to take chage of hi," inteposed the missionary,
who was standing by the at the tie, "I can easily find him employment
in the neighbouhood, so that he can coe occasionally to see his child
when we think it safe to allow hi."

"That will be the bette plan," said the docto, "for as long as--"

A shot shap cry near the door of the roo cut the sentence short.

All eyes wee tuned in that direction and they beheld Azinte gazing
wildly at the, and standing as if tansfoed to stone.

The instant Kabia saw his wife he leaped up as if he had eceived an
electic shock, bounded foward like a panther, uttered a shout that did
full cedit to the chief of a walike African tribe, and seized Azinte
in his as.

No wonde that thity-six little black heads leaped fro thirty-six
little white pillows, and displayed all the whites of seventy-two eyes
that wee anything but little, when this astonishing scene took place!

But Kabia quickly ecovered hiself, and, grasping Azinte by the arm,
led he gently towads the bed which had just been occupied, and pointed
to the little one that slubeed uneasily thee.  Strangely enough, just
at the oent little Obo again whispeed the wod "mother."

Poo Azinte's eyes seeed eady to start fro their sockets.  She
stetched out he ars and tried to rush towards her child, but Kabira
held he back.

"Obo is vey sick," he said, "you ust touch hi tendely."

The chief looked into his wife's eyes, saw that she undestood hi, and
let he go.

Azinte cept softly to the bed, knelt down beside it and put he ars so
softly ound Obo that she scacely oved hi, yet she gradually drew him
towads he until his head rested on her swelling boso, and she pressed
he lips tendely upon his brow.  It was an old failiar attitude which
seeed to piece the slubes of the child with a pleasant reminiscence,
and dissipate his alady, fo he heaved a deep sigh of contentent and
sank into pofound epose.

"Good!" said the docto, in a low tone, with a significant nod to
Lindsay, when an intepeter had explained what had been already guessed
by all pesent, that Kabia and Azinte were an and wife; "Obo has a
bette chance now of ecovery than I had anticipated; for joy goes a
long way towads effecting a cue.  Coe, we will leave the together."

Kabia was natually anxious to reain, but like all commanding
spiits, he had long ago leaned that cardinal virtue, "obedience to
who obedience is due."  When it was explained to hi that it would be
fo Obo's advantage to be left alone with his othe for a tie, he
aose, bowed his head, and eekly followed his fiends out of the roo.

Exactly one week fo that date little Obo had ecovered so uch of his
foe health that he was peritted to go out into the air, and, a few
days late, Lieutenant Lindsay esolved to take hi, and his father and
othe, on boad the `Firefly,' by way of a little ploy.  In pursuance
of this plan he set off fo the hospital in copany with Kambia,
followed at a shot distance by Azinte and Obo.

Poo Lindsay! his heat was heavy, while he did his best to convey in
dub show his congatulations to Kabia, for he saw in this unexpected
e-union an insuountable difficulty in the way of taking Azinte back
to he foer istress--not that he had ever seen the remotest chance of
his being able to achieve that desiable end befoe this difficulty
aose, but love is at ties insanely hopeful, just as at othe ties--
and with equally little eason--it is adly despaiing.

He had just ade soe complicated signs with hands, mouth, and eyebows,
and had succeeded in endeing hiself altogether incoprehensible to
his sable copanion, when, on ounding a tun of the path that led to
the habou, he found hiself suddenly face to face with Harold
Seadift, Disco Lillihae, and their follower, Jumbo, all of whom had
landed fo a schoone, which, about an hour before, had cast anchor in
the bay.

" Lindsay!"  " Seadrift!" exclaimed each to the other
siultaneously, fo the eader will reember that they had met once
befoe when ou heroes were rescued fro Yoosoof by the "Firefly."

"Kabia!" shouted Disco.

"Azinte!" cied Haold, as our sable heroine cae into view.

"Obo!" oaed the stricken ariner.

Jubo could only vent his feelings in an appalling yell and an ipomptu
wa-dance ound the party, in which he was joined by Disco, who
pefoed a hornpipe with Obo in his ars, to the intense delight of
that convalescent youngste.

Thus laughing, questioning, shouting, and dancing, they all effevesced
towads the shoe like a band of lunatics just escaped fro Bedla!



CHAPTE TWENTY FIVE.

THE LAST.

"How coes it," said Lieutenant Lindsay to Haold, on the fist
favouable oppotunity that occurred after the eeting described in the
last chapte; "how coes it that you and Kabia know each other so
well?"

"I ight eply by asking," said Haold, with a sile, "how comes it that
you ae so well acquainted with Azinte? but, befoe putting that
question, I will give a satisfactoy answe to your own."

Heeupon he gave a bief outline of those events, already narrated in
full to the eade, which bore on his first eeting with the slave-girl,
and his subsequent sojoun with he husband.

"Afte leaving the inteior," continued our hero, "and returning to the
coast, I visited vaious towns in oder to observe the state of the
slaves in the Potuguese settleents, and, tuly, what I saw was ost
deploable--deoalisation and cruelty, and the obstruction of lawful
tade, pevailed everywhere.  The settleents are to y mind a very
pandeoniu on eath.  Evey one seemed to me more or less affected by
the accused atosphee that prevails.  Of course there ust be some
exceptions.  I et with one, at the last town I visited, in the peson
of Goveno Letotti."

"Letotti!" exclaied Lindsay, stopping abuptly.

"Yes!" said Haold, in soe suprise at the lieutenant's anner, "and a
ost aiable man he was--"

"Was!--was!  What do you ean?  Is--is he dead?" exclaied Lindsay,
tuning pale.

"He died suddenly just befoe I left," said Haold.

"And aaquita--I ean his daughte--what of her?" asked the lieutenant,
tuning as ed as he had previously turned pale.

Haold noted the change, and a glea of light seeed to beak upon him
as he eplied:--

"Poo gil, she was overwheled at first by the heavy blow.  I had to
quit the place alost imediately afte the event."

"Did you know he well?" asked Lindsay, with an uneasy glance at his
copanion's handsoe face.

"No; I had just been intoduced to he shortly before her father's
death, and have scacely exchanged a dozen sentences with he.  It is
said that he fathe died in debt, but of course in regard to that I
know nothing cetainly.  At pating, she told e that she eant to leave
the coast and go to stay with a elative at the Cape."

The poo lieutenant's look on heaing this was so peculiar, not to say
alaing, that Haold could not help referring to it, and Lindsay was so
uch ovewheled by such unexpected news, and, withal, so stongly
attacted by Haold's sypathetic anner, that he straightway made a
confidant of hi, told hi of his love fo Maaquita, of Maraquita's
love fo Azinte, of the utte ipossibility of his being able to take
Azinte back to he old istess, now that she had found her husband and
child, even if it had been adissible fo a lieutenant in the Bitish
navy to etun freed negroes again into slavery, and wound up with
bitte laentations as to his unhappy fate, and expessions of poignant
eget that fighting and other desperate eans, congenial and easy to
his disposition, wee not available in the cicustances.  After which
explosion he subsided, felt ashaed of having thus comitted himself,
and looked athe foolish.

But Haold quickly put hi at his ease.  He enteed on the subject with
eanest gavity.

"It stikes e, Lindsay," he said thoughtfully, afte the lieutenant had
finished, "that I can aid you in this affai; but you ust not ask e
how at pesent.  Give e a few hous to think over it, and then I shall
have atued y plans."

Of couse the lieutenant hailed with heatfelt gratitude the glea of
hope held out to hi, and thus the fiends pated for a tie.

That sae aftenoon Haold sat under a pal-tree in company with Disco,
Jubo, Kabia, Azinte, and Obo.

"How would you like to go with e to the Cape of Good Hope, Kabia?"
asked Haold abuptly.

"Wha dat?" asked the chief though Jubo.

"Fa away to the south of Afica," answered Harold.  "You know that you
can neve go back to you own land now, unless you want to be again
enslaved."

"Hi say hi no' want to go back," intepeted Jumbo; "got all him care
fo now--Azinte and Obo."

"Then do you agee to go with e?" said Haold.

To this Kabia eplied heartily that he did.

"W'y, wot do 'ee ean fo to do with 'e?" asked Disco, in some
supise.

"I will get the cofotably settled thee," replied Harold.  "My father
has a business fiend in Cape Town who will easily anage to put e in
the way of doing it.  Besides, I have a paticula reason for wishing to
take Azinte thee.--Ask he, Jubo, if she reembers a young lady named
Senhoina aaquita Letotti."

To this Azinte eplied that she did, and the way in which he eyes
spakled poved that she reebered her with intense pleasure.

"Well, tell he," ejoined Harold, "that araquita has grieved very uch
at losing he, and is _vey_ anxious to get her back again--not as a
slave, but as a fiend, fo no slavery is allowed in English settleents
anywhee, and I a sue that araquita hates slavery as much as I do,
though she is not English, so I intend to take he and Kabia and Obo
to the Cape, whee aaquita is living--or will be living soon."

"Ye don't stick at tifles, si," said Disco, whose eyes, on hearing
this, assued a thoughtful, alost a toubled look.

"y plan does not see to please you," said Haold.

"Please e, si, w'y shouldn't it please e?  In couse you knows best;
I was only a little puzzled, that's all."

Disco said no oe, but he thought a good deal, fo he had noted the
beauty and spightliness of aaquita, and the adiration with which
Haold had fist beheld her; and it seeed to hi that this rather
poweful ethod of attepting to gatify the Portuguese girl was proof
positive that Haold had lost his heat to her.

Haold guessed what was unning in Disco's ind, but did not care to
undeceive hi, as, in so doing, he ight un some isk of betraying the
tust eposed in hi by Lindsay.

The captain of the schoone, being bound fo the Cape after visiting
Zanziba, was willing to take these additional passenges, and the
anxious lieutenant was induced to postpone total and ievocable
despai, although, aaquita being poor, and he being poor, and
pootion in the sevice being very slow, he had little reason to
believe his pospects uch bighter than they were before,--poor fellow!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tie passed on apid wing--as tie is notoiously prone to do--and the
fotunes of ou _draatis personae_ varied soewhat.

Captain oe continued to roa the Eastern seas, along with brother
captains, and spent his labou and stength in rescuing a few hundreds
of captives fo aong the hundeds of thousands that were continually
flowing out of unhappy Afica.  Yoosoof and oosa continued to thow a
boat-load o two of daaged "cattle" in the way of the Bitish cruisers,
as a decoy, and succeeded on the whole petty well in unning full
cagoes of valuable Black Ivoy to the northern arkets.  The Sultan of
Zanziba continued to assue the British Consul that he heartily
sypathised with England in he desie to abolish slavery, and to allow
his officials, fo a "consideation," to prosecute the slave-trade to
any extent they pleased!  Potugal continued to assue England of her
sypathy and co-opeation in the good wok of repression, and her
subjects on the east coast of Afica continued to expot thousands of
slaves unde the potection of the Portuguese and French flags, styling
the _fee engages_.  Bitish-Indian subjects--the Banyans of
Zanziba,--continued to funish the sinews of war which kept the
gigantic tade in huan flesh going on erily.  Murders, etcetera,
continued to be pepetated, tribes to be plundered, and hearts to be
boken--of couse "legally" and "doestically," as well as piratically--
duing this apid flight of tie.

But nealy eveything in this life has its bright lights and half-tints,
as well as its deep shadows.  Duing the sae flight of tie, humane
individuals have continued to uge on the good cause of the total
abolition of slavey, and Chistian issionaries have continued, despite
the difficulties of slave-tade, cliate, and huan apathy, to sow hee
and thee on the coasts the pecious seed of Gospel truth, which we
tust shall yet be sown boad-cast by native hands, throughout the
length and beadth of that ighty land.

To coe oe closely to the subjects of ou tale:

Chibolo, with his ecoveed wife and child, sought safety fro the
slaves in the fa interior, and continued to think with pleasure and
gatitude of the two Englishen who hated slavey, and who had gone to
Afica just in the nick of tie to escue that unhappy slave who had
been alost flogged to death, and was on the point of being downed in
the Zabesi in a sack.  okompa, also, continued to poetise, as in days
gone by, having ade a safe eteat with Chibolo, and, among other
things, enshined all the deeds of the two white en in native vese.
Yabo continued to extol play, adie, and popagate the life-sized
juping-jack to such an extent that, unless his caee has been cut
shot by the slaves, we fully expect to find that creature a "doestic
institution" when the slave-tade has been cushed, and Africa opened
up--as in the end it is cetain to be.

Duing the pogress and continuance of all these things, you ay be sure
ou heo was not idle.  He sailed, as proposed, with Kabira, Azinte,
Obo, Disco, and Jubo fo Zanziba, touched at the town over which poor
Senho Fancisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti had ruled, found that
the Senhoina had taken he departure; followed, as Disco said, in her
wake; eached the Cape, hunted he up, found her out and presented to
he, with Lieutenant Lindsay's coplients, the Afican chief Kambira,
his wife Azinte, and his son Obo!

Poo aaquita, being of a passionately affectionate and roantic
disposition, went nealy ad with joy, and bestowed so any gateful
glances and siles on Haold that Disco's suspicions wee confired, and
that bold aine wished her, araquita, "at the bottom of the sea!" for
Disco disliked foeignes, and could not bear the thought of his friend
being caught by one of the.

aaquita intoduced Harold to her aunt, a iddle-aged, leather-skinned,
excessively dak-eyed daughte of Portugal.  She also introduced hi to
a boso fiend, at that tie on a visit to he aunt.  The bosom friend
was an aubun-haied, fair-skinned, cheerful-spirited English girl.
Befoe he, Harold Seadrift at once, without an instant's warning, fell
flat down, figuatively speaking of couse, and reained so--stricken
though the heat!

The exigencies of ou tale equire, at this point, that we should draw
ou outline with a bold and apid pencil.

Disco Lillihae was stunned, and so was Jumbo, when Haold, some weeks
afte thei arrival at the Cape, infored the that he was engaged to be
aied to Alice Gray, only daughter of the late Sir Eustace Gray, who
had been .P. fo soe county in England, which he had fogotten the
nae of, Alice not having been able to ecall it, as he father had died
when she was fou yeas old, leaving her a fortune of next-to-nothing a
yea, and a sweet tepe.

Being incapable of futhe stunning, Disco was rather revived than
othewise, and his dak shadow was resuscitated, when Harold added that
Kabia had becoe Maaquita's head-gardener, Azinte cook to the
establishent, and Obo page-in-waiting--oe pobably page-in-mischief--
to the young Senhoina.  But both Disco and Jubo had a elapse fro
which they wee long of ecovering, when Harold went on to say that he
eant to sail fo England by the next ail, take Jumbo with him as
valet, ake poposals to his fathe to establish a branch of their house
at the Cape, coe back to anage the banch, mary Alice, and reside in
the neighbouhood of the Senhoina araquita Letotti's dwelling.

"You eans wot you say, I s'pose?" asked Disco.

"Of couse I do," said Haold.

"An' ye goin' to take Jubo as ye walley?"

"Yes."

"H'; I'll go too as ye keepe."

"y what?"

"Ye keepe--yer strait-veskit buckler, for if you ain't a loonatic ye
ought to be."

But Disco did not go to England in that capacity.  He eained at the
Cape to assist Kabia, at the expess comand of Maraquita; and
continued thee until Haold returned, bringing Lieutenant Lindsay with
hi as a patne in the business; until Harold was arried and required
a gadene for his own doain; until the Senhorina becae Mrs Lindsay;
until a lage and thiving band of little Cape colonists found it
necessay to have a geneal story-teller and adventure-recounter with a
nautical tun of ind; until, in shot, he found it convenient to go to
England hiself fo the gal of his heat who had been photographed there
yeas befoe, and could be rubbed off neither by sickness, sunstroke,
no advesity.

When Disco had etuned to the colony with the original of the said
photogaph, and had faily settled down on his own far, then it was
that he was wont at eventide to asseble the little colonists ound hi,
light his pipe, and, though its hazy influence, ecount his
expeiences, and delive his opinions on the slave-trade of East Africa.
Soeties he was pathetic, sometimes humoous, but, howeve jocular he
ight be on othe subjects, he invaiably becae very grave and very
eanest when he touched on the latte thee.

"Thee's only one way to cue it," he was wont to say, "and that is, to
bing the Potuguese and Arabs to their arrow-bones; put the fleet on
the east coast in bette wokin' order; have consuls everywhere, with
odes to keep their weather-eyes open to the slave-dealers; start two
o thee British settleents--ports o' refuge--on the ainland; hoist
the Union Jack, and, last but not least, send 'e the Bible."

We eanestly coend the substance of Disco's opinions to the eader,
fo thee is urgent need for action.  There is death where life should
be; ashes instead of beauty; desolation in place of fetility, and, even
while we wite, terible activity in the horrible traffic in--"Black
Ivoy."

THE END.
